<h3 id="c45">廢止印日條約與英日關係 <a href="#c45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>（一）　世界經濟會議前途之暗影</p>
<p>華盛頓爐邊談話以英國首相及法國前内總理先後返國談話而暫告一段落。就表面上觀察。英美法三大國。對通貨問題。關稅戰爭。貿易關係。與夫戰債等。雖無具體的解决方法。但彼此之間。已有相當諒解。其詳細辦法且留待六月中旬之世界經濟會議。故資本主義經濟學者及一般社會對此。均表示樂觀。大體皆以就此可克服當前之經濟恐慌。新的市面。頗有好轉之可能。惟英美兩國對立之根本問題。如南美之投資。如歐洲市塲。如東方市塲。等等矛盾關係。皆置之不論不議之列則英美間實際問題依然存在對峙之形。仍未化除欲使其協同一致。又豈空言所能奏效。</p>
<p>况英帝國自去年七月二十一日渥太華會議開會之後其於英帝國内部由英吉利本國以至於海外各自治領殖民地。均將得新團結。大有與英本國打成一片。以克服其經濟矛盾。打破政治離心之傾向。此種經濟的聯盟。除蘇聯具有特殊形態之外。法國之歐洲聯盟。僅有其名。美國亦不過歷史的意識與地理上之便利。皆未能成爲緊密之團結。後起之日本。占領東三省以後。極力使日本與東北聯成一氣。形成其所謂（日滿經濟聯盟）以北對蘇聯東制美國西脅中國而侵入南洋與印度。是故英日之間。在經濟上乃不能不處於對立地位。蓋英國雖爲資本主義的先進國家。而其產業基礎多半在於棉毛紡織。此與日本不能融洽者一也。再則英國船舶出航海外。其所裝載之主要貨品。多爲煤炭。而由直布羅陀海峽以至於新嘉坡香港等各海港。又多不產煤。在我國北部復以英國資本所經營之開灤及福中二者爲最大。是則與日本九州及撫順等炭礦。適相對立。此又英日不能融洽者二也。再次則爲英日對華投資。其地域各據雖不相同。而商業關係。實爲不可緩和之爭奪。沿長江各地投資之競爭尤屬各不相讓此英日兩國在經濟上不能妥協者三也雖然。政治上無論爲對蘇之防禦對美之爭雄與夫壓迫我中國民族革命運動。皆有共同之點。是以英日經濟對立雖日趨激劇而英日之政治諒解依舊繼續也。不過經濟關係。竟究十分重大。即以印日條約廢止一事論。</p>
<p>（二）　印日條約之廢止</p>
<p>印度洵爲英國之寳庫。其供給英國以原料。吸收英國之大量投資。然英印相距遙遠。加以近年民族運動暴發。離心傾向。愈趨明顯。是以日貨乘機而入。印度與日本之商務關係。乃益密切兹試舉近兩年來印度輸入日貨價格總值如下。</p>
<p>對日輸入</p>
<p>一九三一年　一一○·三五七千圓日金　一三三·一六五千圓日金</p>
<p>一九三二年　一九二·四九一千圓日金　一一六·八六五千圓日金</p>
<p>其中日本棉布之輸入印度。尤占主要地位。數量與金額如下。</p>
<p>輸入數量</p>
<p>一九三一年　四○三·九三六千平方碼　四九·八一八千圓日金</p>
<p>一九三二年　六四四·四五八千平方碼　八○·六二六千圓日金</p>
<p>逐年增加之傾向。非常明顯。印度爲日本最好之市塲。豈待龜筮。至於日本對印度輸出（棉紗。）亦值得注意。其數量及金額如次。</p>
<p>一九三一年　一六·○九四包　五·五九二千圓日金</p>
<p>一九三二年　五○·八三六包　一四·三四三千圓日金</p>
<p>日本棉布之輸出至印度。爲最有望之貿易。去年僅棉布所值。已超過八千萬。再加棉紗。其總值則已迫近一萬萬日金矣。今者印度政府。將於本年十月十日廢止印日（通商互惠）條約。實行取締傾消稅則其於日本之打擊爲何如耶。日本紡織界羣相聚議。擬不買印度棉花以相報復。然日本國内不產原棉。且印棉猶可在英國本國尋覓消塲。則日本每年少買印。棉一百五六十萬包。於印度損失甚微。且印度尚可在英國及其他各地求彌補之道。日本受重稅之制限。棉布棉紗。失却印度之廣大市塲。在此經濟恐慌深化期中且在對華積極侵略之際。此種慢性的經濟封鎖。於日本誠爲莫大之打擊也。</p>
<p>英日關係。在政治上縱甚親密。惟於經濟的競爭。則日趨尖銳而印度之實行增加關稅。不過爲爭鬭之發端。鞏固英帝國内經濟聯盟之初步嘗試。將來英日兩國對中國市塲之爭奪。恐尤甚於今日之關稅戰也。</p>

<p>記者附言：關於本問題之討論，現在告一結束。此次論戰起源於雄聲君和尤懷臯先生的兩封信，隨後陸續接到各方來信，每日必有七八起，討論時間，不覺就延長到這麽久，這是我們始料所不及的。從這次熱烈的討論，我們格外可以看出這問題對於我們是何等重要，而我們對於這問題之需要解决，又是何等迫切。其實這就是中國整個的出路問題。同時，承讀者諸君如此熱烈參加論戰，可見一般讀者對於本欄已有相當同情，這又是我們除要向投函諸君致其謝意外，所深引以爲慰者。我們本打算將這問題討論出一個結果，可是因爲時間已經延到這麽久，還有其他許多重要函件，急待發表，不得不就此半途宣告結束。還有不少討論函件，内容都很精彩，都已不及披露，我們深覺抱歉，將來如有機會，仍當另行發表。這次討論，問題之重心大槪在能不能回到鄕村去這一點上。記者個人意見，則以爲本問題之重心，並不在能不能回去，而在（一）怎樣回農村？（二）回農村去做什麽？所以我不反對回到農村，而要問回農村的目的是怎樣？這二個問題如有正確答案，一切枝節論爭，皆可迎刃而解。其次，此次論戰，除尤懷臯朱天青兩位先生外，大都說農村不能回去，不能回去的原因，他們大都說得很透澈，而怎樣去解除這不能回去的原因，則他們並没有積極的建議，</p>
<p>就有說話也很隱晦。於是就有一班讀者來信質問：你說農村不能回去，你的辦法怎樣？我們不回鄕村，出路又在那里？其實這問題很容易解答。我們第一步先問現在中國的農村能不能回去？答案是不能：不能回去的根本原因何在？則一班讀者已經替我詳細指出。那末我們現在祇要把這不能回去的根本原因除去，農村自然就可以回去：反轉來說，我們要回農村，第一祇有從除去不能回去的根本原因入手，此外都不是辦法。這本來無需說明，他們旣已替我們把不能回去的根本原因指出，反面他們早已把辦法告訴了我們。譬如治病，爲寒爲熟，病因旣明，只須對症下藥就得。舉一反三，自在讀者，若必要窮根究底，那就太不聰明了。質諸讀者，以爲如何？</p>

<p>丨本埠張方遠君來信丨</p>
<p>兹懇者，有蘇中學生來稱，時事新報曾載有一繆治組織一赴俄工讀團，通訊處在上海民國中尼山里一號，招致青年加入。伊等頗擬加入。弟甚主鄭重，故快函奉詢，苟有所知，乞即賜示。詢者</p>
<p>一、繆治捷爲何許人，其生平若何？</p>
<p>二、傳聞此舉與上海青年會有關，確不？</p>
<p>三、出國與抵俄之手續，是否由繆君辦理，又個人赴俄，手續困難否？</p>
<p>四、赴俄有工作做否？</p>

<p>羅家倫</p>
<p>（爲南京四校聯合運動會而作）</p>
<p>運動會有兩種意義、</p>
<p>第一是增進民族健康、養成健全的體魄、</p>
<p>第二是培養運動家的風度、而爲民族的道德模範、</p>
<p>第一點的意義很明瞭、健全之心、當宅於健全之身、何况中國民族前途的艱難困苦正多、設新興的一代、没有持久耐勞的體魄、其何以負建國的責任、大器晚成、世界多少大政治家、大軍事家、</p>
<p>大學問家、大事業家的成功、都在五十六十歲以後、而中國人到了五十六十、往往就是衰老退休行將就木、設不從發展體魄來挽救、民族前途、何堪設想、</p>
<p>關於第二點尤爲重要、我所謂（運動家的風度）、就是中國古代所謂（君子之爭）、就是英文所謂（斯拍兹門悉普）、（君子無所爭、必也射乎、揖讓而升、下而飮、其爭也君子、）近代運動有一定的規律、按着這些規律、在公開的塲所、萬目睽睽的監視之下、以爭勝負、不用陰謀、不施詭計、不作軌外的行動、以自己的努力、就大家的公判、勝不驕人、敗不尤人、如網球競賽以後、勝敗兩方、隔着網互相握手、大家應當知道美國大總統競選失敗以後、失敗者首先向勝利者拍電致賀、大意說是我們兩個人同以我們的政綱、公諸國民、國民選擇你的、我敬向你致賀、祝你爲國服務的順利成功、這種精神、正是從運動塲上來的、那和中國政客一樣、一經失敢、便以天下事不可爲、要用種種的陰謀、去暗中搗亂、中國政治的不上軌道、也就是由於一般國民、缺少運動家的風度、要中國政治社會有軌道、非培養運動家的風度、以爲國民道德的標準不可、</p>
<p>運動會不是爲個人爭錦標的、運動會的使命、爲培養運動家的風度、以團體協調的動作、共同發展健全的民族體魄、俾將來共同擔負建立新中國的責任、</p>

<p>▲完成後得委託書商印刷發行</p>
<p>二十五日行政院會議通過敎部提議政府自編中小學敎科書各節、迭誌本報、兹覓得敎部原提議案一件、照錄如下、</p>
<p>爲提議事查我國中小學敎科書、向取審定制、由書商聘請私人編輯、經政府審查、審定後卽可自由發行、此制跳以鼓勵私人著作、俾敎科書得因自由競爭而日益改進、惟在今日、政府實亦有自行編纂中小學敎科書、與已經審定之私人著作並行之必要　其理由如下、</p>
<p>一·爲貫澈復興民族也　復興民族爲中國今日救國之要圖、中小學敎科書倘能以復興民族爲中心、則其影響所及、關係民族前途自至深鉅、但欲復興民族、政府必須先有一貫政策、由政府統一主持之、較爲親切有效、故中小學敎科書、當由政府編纂而不徒假手於書商或其他私人、　　二·爲厲行課程標準也　中小學課程標準、業經中央核定、由敎育部頒布在案、此項標準、欲其嚴厲施行、必須由政府頒行恰合該項標準之新敎科書、方可收效、如仍由書商聘請私人編輯、仍不免有改頭換面鈔襲陳編之弊、卽無此弊、恐亦不免有毫釐千里之差、</p>
<p>三·爲樹敎科書之範本也　我國中小學敎科書、三十年來、雖有改進之處、但向由私人編輯而政府未嘗與以積極之指導、故進步尚覺遲緩、敎科書雖不必採國定制、但爲督促敎科書長足進步起見、由政府特編一套以示範、實即積極指導之最有效方法、勝於僅予以審定之消極工作多多矣、</p>
<p>基於上述理由、敎育部自去年起開始籌備、近數月來、即擬著手編纂中小學敎科書、以便全國中小學之採用、並向歐中美日本各國購辦最新編輯之中小學敎科書、現譯出者、已有數種、以備編輯時參考之用、兹更將所擬進行辦法述之如次、</p>
<p>一·敎科書之種類、</p>
<p>甲·小學各科敎科書及敎授書全套、</p>
<p>乙·小學必要之參考書及掛圖全套、</p>
<p>丙·中學各科敎科書全套</p>
<p>二·主持編纂者、</p>
<p>甲·小學敎科書由敎育部普通司會同編譯館辦理、</p>
<p>乙·中學敎科書由國立編譯館會同敎育部普通司辦理、</p>
<p>三·各種敎科書分三期完成、</p>
<p>甲·第一期　二十二年十一月底完成、二十三年四月發行、</p>
<p>乙·第二期　二十三年二月底完成、二十三年七月發行、</p>
<p>丙·第三期　二十三年八月底完成、二十四年十二月發行、</p>
<p>四·經費預算、</p>
<p>五·完成後之發行辦法、</p>
<p>甲·本部得委託書商印刷、發行、</p>
<p>乙·與私人所編經政府審定之敎科書同時並行　　▲編輯中小學敎科書預算表</p>

<p>第四章　業務之情形</p>
<p>（乙）新藥界的業務</p>
<p>我曾在醫師公會提議。另組一個委員會。對於新藥目錄，刋物，說明。加以相當整理。業經通過。但是至今工作還是甚少。改日當將辦法和意見另行作文論之。</p>
<p>在目前的狀况之下。最要緊的自然是製藥廠。雖說化學原料。仍多取之舶來。然而仿造與配製。究竟杜塞些漏巵。可惜此種製藥廠。至今海上還祗有新亞信誼福康等四五家。而資本也尚欠充足。出品不能很豐富。並且拜外的心理。從病人方面以至醫者方面。都不能免。於是製藥廠的營業。猶未十分發達。這事頗要請社會上注意提倡的。</p>
<p>按上海一埠。可以說全國新藥最大的市場。就是内地各處醫院醫師所用藥品。也不過由這十餘家成樂商。二十餘家配方商（兼營批發）。五六家製藥廠。以及一部份較大的外國藥房。（市上俄人所開之小藥店殊無推藥至内地能力）。和各國藥廠駐滬經理等幾家供給　綜計商號的數目。尚不及上海市上舊式國藥舖（專銷本埠）的一半。雖然北幾省另有天津青島等處供給。腹部各省由漢口供給。雲貴各省由西貢方面進口。兩粤藥品由香港進口。然而或仍是上海分號。或則商店不多。皆有實情可以調查。由北可以證明。我們全國的醫療器械藥品。仰給於外人者總數並不驚人。新醫的事業。毫不發達。然而現在一般高唱保存舊醫的。往往拿利權外溢。提倡國貨的言語。來聳人聽聞。政府諸公。也就以爲（科學醫要提倡，無奈西藥輪入漏巵太大，還是削足就屨開國醫館罷。但是一方面對於美國的麥子，棉花，西貢的白米。德國的人造絲。一切一切日常生活必需之品仰給外人的。却並不十分考量而說道。（提倡國有農業）。（提倡國粹蠶桑）啊？唉！舍本而逐末。倒底怎樣一回事呢？（本節完）</p>
<h3 id="c189">怎樣維持身體的健康（中） <a href="#c189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— 澕俊孫</p>
<p>（一）怎樣可以避免傳染病的發生？</p>
<p>傳染病是妨害健康及生命的大仇敵，防制他進入身體發生疾病，就是保護健康的最先條件。我們知道傳染病的原因是細菌，他一定要侵入到我們身體裏面，才能發病，如能斷絶他侵入的路徑，病就不會發生。侵入的路徑，（一）由食物傳染，經口進入胃腸的，如傷寒症，霞亂，痢疾，腸寄生虫等，他的預防法，是自吃生水生菜，尤其在夏大勿宜吃蒼蠅住過的冷食，及腐敗食物，勿用病人用過的食具，注意消毒病人的大小便。（二）由空氣傳染，經鼻進入肺部的，如肺結核肺炎，鼠疫，流行性感冒等，預防方法，是勿近病人，談話時最少距離五英尺，勿用病人用過之食具，白喉是由口或由鼻侵入體内的。（三）由病毒經過身體與身體的接觸而傳染的，如花柳病，疥瘡等，預防的方法，勿近不潔女子，勿與可疑的女子行房事，不得已時當用保護器物，如保險套或如意袋，出了毛病當早去看正式的醫生，以免一發不可收拾。（四）由病毒經皮膚傷口而進入體内的，如各種化膿疾病脾脫疽等，所以皮膚破了，應當注意消毒。（五）由病毒經過動物的咬叮而傳染的，如蚊虫之於瘧疾，跳蝨之於鼠疫，瘋狗之狂太病等，預防的方法，只需隔離這種動物，如帳子可防蚊子，長靴可防跳蝨，這種預防，應當隨時隨地依照情形而處置。</p>
<p>（二）怎樣可以强壯身體增高抵抗力？</p>
<p>我人身體的抵抗力，是健康的要素，是抵抗疾病原動力，人人應當注意而提高他，使身體强壯起來，有許多人信仰打補血針，吃補樂來達到目的，但是錯誤的。天然的日光，新鮮空氣，凡此不外光線，才是眞正的補劑，諸君不要當這是老僧常談，這三種寳貝，不但可以强身，還是醫肺病的良藥呢，不看德國人麽，身體强壯，精神充足，他們的秘訣，就是還利用這三件寳貝，我們上海人居住在都會之中，房子小得似鴿子窠，生活無定，習慣不良，又缺少這三種物質，弄得個個人面色蒼白，精神萎頓，爲什麽不努力攝些不化錢的眞正補藥呢？人們只要每天在清鮮空氣之中，運動半小時，見見太陰光，保你身體强壯，勝於吃藥打針，至於運動，我們不贊成做些含有競爭性的劇烈運動，如賽跑打球等等，因如他對於身體有害無益，最好的是柔軟性的體操，或太極拳，因爲筋肉的動作，平均不傷心肺，最要緊的，不可間斷，此紫光線，是對於忙碌的人尤其有用，與天至少要照十來分鐘，身體一定會健美起來。</p>
<p>可是運動不能過分的，對於有以臟病肺病的人，尤不相宜，不然毛病反而加重，照日光照紫外光線，亦不一定有好處。例如有肺病發熱的人及幾種患皮膚病的人，不能照的，那麽怎樣可算得完備呢？我們可以說凡是要得到健康，維持健康的人們，終離不開醫生的管理同指導。</p>
<h3 id="c190">告患性病（花柳病）者　（下） <a href="#c190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— 胡嘉言</p>
<p>（四）他們除用價廉物美的口號招徠外，還怕病家有些不放心，於是又想出立保單一種法子來，說明如到期不愈或未能全愈，可退還診金等項云云。甚至說可憑衛生局核騐單爲證。這種話當然無論那一個都聽得進的，但事實上何嘗如此呢？我們曉得，無論那一種病症，他的蔓延和停止有時狠捉摸不定的，决不像書本上所說的固定模型一模一樣的；且每一種病都有發生其他合併症的可能性（檢輕微病也是一樣）雖說可以事前用種種法子防止他，但在事實上並不盡可能的。性病也不外此例，所以醫師診病，包下可全愈一層是不　　住的　難然他看好的病特殊多也是　　。至於立保單，那更不用提了！即退一步說，這事由於自身情願，他人是不便指摘的。那我對於檢騐單爲證一事，不妨再向病家解釋幾句。關於檢騐通例，祗有正號（即加號，有的意思）在學理上有價值，負號（即减號，没有的表示）是没有多大價值的。譬如這個人瓦司蔓反應係負號，那我們决不能說他現在已確無梅毒，甚至說他已經斷根全愈；白濁症檢查無白濁菌，肺結核痰中無結核桿菌，也是一樣的。在症狀顯著的時候正號還容易，在潛伏性就不然了，到了梅毒第三期（腦梅毒脊隨痰）的時候，臨床上診斷非常靠得住，但血液檢查並不一定是正號：白濁到了發生單性關節炎的時候，如果他尿道無變化，那决對尋不到球菌的。假若病家到了這時期去責問他無何還不全愈斷根，他可以拿檢騐單作他的防身具，你還有什麽講呢！聰明的他們，當然說你另外又患病，他的治痰和他前一樣不樣，你又弄不精楚。即使檢查不是負號，他們可隨便在你起居飮食方面指摘一小節，說你不當心所致，（我們素來有一種傳說，說當小便時，驟被冷風所吸，即患濁痛；此說相信的很多，類此者不少，他們當然可以隨便指摘的）。或且竟說你是由於新傳染。你又有什麽結可辯明呢！况且患性病的病人，十之五六是諱莫如深的，中國人生性素來又是息事寗人不爲己甚的；即使眞有不當的地方被看出，也不會有人來多事的。所以他們的戲法，也永遠不會拆穿。</p>
<p>根據上面所述的情形，可以發見下列的二條通例，即，越是診斷得容易越靠不住；越是廣告宣傳得利害，越要留心；這二者我且分開來在下面解釋：</p>
<p>（一）關於這一條，恐怕狠容易引起誤會。因診斷有時固不易，但有時祗須憑臨床上一次診察，就可知其大槪的。這種證據也狠多，却拿性病來說，像急性白濁初發作期，梅毒發生全身狀態時，以及脊髓痰症狀顯著時等診斷都不狠難的。但我是完全有爲而言。因爲這一般醫生，大半没有醫學上眞正基礎，他們的知識，一半係固定書本上的，一半是見聞的。知當然而不知所以然，知模範性病型而不知種種變態；所以他們診治病症，祗有武斷的錯誤，而不會有優柔寡斷的地方這是可想而見的。再則他們腹儉心虚，如一時報不出一個病症，怕病家賓放心，所以這種錯誤，是他們最容易犯的。</p>
<p>（二）我决不是說醫師廣告都不應該登，但不贊成誇大和過分欺騙的宣傳罷了！這也是他們所慣用，幾乎可以包辦的；除新聞紙及定期日刋週刋月刋外，在診所門窗玻璃上，也有種種花樣不同翻新的標語，像新開戲院菜館一樣。爲他們唯一的標識。此中究竟，在上海住久的人，大槪都已曉得；但外埠遠道來的上當的還是不少。所以我也不嫌瑣碎提出來囑病家注意。</p>
<p>病家就醫時應該注意的地方，我所知道的都寫出來了！那當然這樣情形，决不僅限於性病一部分，但佔大多數是確然無疑。此外我對於病家本身，還有幾件事希望注意：</p>
<p>（一）性病痛苦解除期有時並不甚難，時日亦無多，但全愈以及防止以後發生合併症等則並不簡單，治療時日也狠長久；决不是覺自身身體無大痛苦或一次檢查報告就可以算數的。尤以慢性白濁症最頑固難愈。所以病家萬萬不可過分心急，暫時的得失關係並不大：决對不要因短期治療稍有効即抱樂觀，反此則不高興。</p>
<p>（二）病家在就醫以前，對於醫師人選，自當留意；但旣經擇定後，主意須穩</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>定，萬不可因一時小得失又換方針，這是有弊無利的。</p>
<p>（三）病家往往在診治時，雖經過正當方法，而未能一時見卓効，於是另就他醫診治。但如他醫診明以前治療方法不錯，而方針舊時，則往往不高興。甚至要求醫師另換他法，此種過尚新奇的心理，於病之本身毫無益處。</p>
<p>（四）病家就診時時喜參　意見，甚至一方面就診，一方又用自己的傳說方法。結果返弄得不好，自尋煩苦，應特殊留意。</p>

<p>— 程瀚章</p>
<p>▲瘧疾</p>
<p>問　瘧疾，是怎樣起的？</p>
<p>答　是因爲一種胞子蟲寄生在血球内而起。</p>
<p>問　瘧疾胞子蟲怎樣能侵入人體的血液内呢？</p>
<p>答　因爲這種胞子蟲，先寄生於一種蚊蟲（呌做瘧蚊）的胃内，當瘧蚊吮血的時候，跟了蚊蟲的唾液而穿入人的血液内。</p>
<p>問　這種病有别的名稱嗎？</p>
<p>答　有三陰瘧，寒熱病，打板子等俗名，又有間歇熟的異名。</p>
<p>問　西文名稱是什麽？</p>
<p>答　Ｍａｌａｒｉａ又名Ｆｅｂｒｉｓ　ｉｎｔｅｒｍｉｔｔｅｎｓ，德文也呌ｅｃｈｓｅｌｌｉｅｂｅｒ。</p>
<p>問　瘧疾在什麽地方什麽季節最多？</p>
<p>答　在熱帶和我國的南部發生很多。春秋兩季，比冬季爲多。</p>
<p>問　我們受了瘧疾胞子蟲傳染之後經過幾天發病？</p>
<p>答　經過十天到十四天發病。</p>
<p>問　瘧疾的主要病狀是什麽？</p>
<p>答　定期性間歇的發熱。</p>
<p>問　這種間歇期有一定的嗎？</p>
<p>答　有隔一天的，呌做隔日熱；隔二天的，呌做四日熱：也有不定而性質兇險的呌做惡性瘧或熱帶瘧。</p>
<p>問　隔日熱和四日熱的病狀怎樣？</p>
<p>答　大多突然先發生强度的惡寒戰慄，顏面蒼白，皮膚厥冷，脈搏細小然後體温昇騰，見皮膚灼熱。此後脈搏再充實，而頻數，脾臟腫脹起來。此外有訴四肢痛，惡心，嘔吐，泄瀉，顏面匐行疹，皮膚知覺過敏等的。最後發汗而移到退熱。脾腫等症狀消失。平均六小時到十小時，體温恢復到尋常。（未完）</p>
<p>（痧藥水）是什麽東西？顧名思義，這當然是救治痧症之水。可是現在一般人所認爲的（痧藥水），並不如此簡單。所謂（痧藥水）這個名詞，確包括（十滴藥水）（救命水）（普濟水）（濟衆水）（神功濟衆水）：：：什麽什麽水。我一時也數不了許多。雖然仿單上載着治什麽病，怎樣的服法，每次應當服多少。一般人又往往不加注意。竟將這種（痧藥水），視同（萬能）的（仙丹）。好像不論什麽症候，均不妨一用，確有（藥到病除）（起死回生）之功，這樣的過分信任（痧藥水），竟認爲（家居旅行）所必備的珍品。其實他們對於（痧藥水）是什麽配成的？牠的功用是怎樣？簡直没有明白咧！、</p>
<p>痧藥水的製劑，大槪不外合（强心）和（鎭靜）兩類藥劑而成。惟其有强心之功，可以之急救一切因劇吐劇瀉，或過分之勞碌，意外之激刺，：：：而突然發生心臟衰弱之虚脫。並以其有鎭靜之作用，同時可以止吐止瀉，定病，及制止抽筋孿痙之效。</p>
<p>吾得爲諸君說明者，强心劑之作用有三：（一）制止心肌搏動過分之亢進：（二）促進心肌搏動之機能。二者之作用，適得其反，運用之際，頗有出入。然二者之功能，確有時亦能相得而益彰。斯固非本篇所能盡道其詳者。若痧藥水中之强心劑，則多具兩者之功能。施諸輕度或不重篤之心臟衰弱，確有功效。（重篤之心臟衰弱，麻痺過甚，内服藥，很少奏效。）然用之逾量，心臟每不堪承受其刺激。過分之興　　實足以使心臟　　　然　　　機能　危險生命譬諸飮酒，少飮確能興奮心肌之活躍，增進血液之循環，每覺身心舒泰。逾量則醉，醉而顚狂，是猶在興奮與麻痺過渡之時期。瞬間，由顚狂而入睡，睡且酣，甚而冥然亡覺。是則已由興奮時期轉入麻醉狀態。乃致以過分之興奮。發</p>
<p>生腦充血，或血管爆裂而死亡者有之。以心臟過分之搏動，勞痺而突然虚脫者，亦多實例。故曰（過猶不及），其禍或更尤甚之。</p>
<p>鎭靜劑之功效，在能止吐止瀉，定痛制孿，已如前述。故斯類之藥品，多含（麻醉性）。有節止神經興奮之功能；麻醉未梢神經，或中樞神經之特效。咸屬（劇藥）或（毒藥）。用之得當，奏效神速。用之失當，足危生命。縱不致死，每多枝節。請設一例以發其凡。</p>
<p>（鴉片）之足以助長精神，是其興奮神經之作用也。同時亦具有止痛之效，是又其麻醉作用也。凡曾吸食鴉片而用以止痛者，多能道之。其有吸之不一筒逾量者，其痛雖止，每反覺頭量目眩，口乾舌燥，噁心煩悶，此又所謂（求益反損）也。然此猶未足危及生命。設以鴉片爲内服或注射之劑者，不按法規，鮮有不中毒者。要以鴉片麻醉作用，對中樞呼吸神經爲害尤烈。吸呼旣停，養氣之來源斷絶。心臟縱未衰弱，於事何益？若而入者，冥途近矣！</p>
<p>近時，坊間所發售之各種（痧藥水）。台法之配劑，固屬不少。其有混用（鴉片酒）或（鴉片烟水）者，當亦不乏其人。甚有以（寵頭水）充作藥品，配合於酒劑或水酒　　而成　謂痧藥水者，更非絶無　　爲害　會，多未之察　　痧藥水之種類旣多，製劑各别。然以余意度之，要不外前述兩類藥劑配合而成。亦間有採及中國舊醫之單方，而雜以西藥者，是則更非吾所敢討論者矣。然吾嘗見以過分信任痧藥水，誤用而受其禍者，憫然憂之！今姑略舉數例以實之。</p>
<p>（一）商人某，晨興，腹微痛。慮發痧，取特備之（痧藥水）服之，痛止。約經二小時，其痛復作。復取痧藥水治之，不效，益之，有頃痛始減。然深覺煩悶，竟莫知如何而適。更進而提之刮之，頸周與胸背，朱痧顯然。方以爲痧根已去，病可無妨。乃不旋踵而腹痛又至，較前尤甚。惶然呼痛，更取痧藥水服之，半瓶不效，又半瓶。痛固未减，復大吐不止，宿食盡出而猶未獲稍止。汗流氣急，手冷而孿，其痛益烈，其勢可危。急投醫院。詢之，得上述之陳說。總計約四小時服痧藥　三瓶。診察之下，已有中毒之徵。而所謂　要之病症　蓋（便秘）已四日矣。先　　日　覺腹痛，全賴痧藥水以愈。於是洗其胃，以清痧藥水之餘孽其腸，以通其便。已而便下，病果霍然。斯眞所謂（天下本無事，庸人自擾之）！</p>
<p>此（商人於第三次强服痧藥水後，竟不吐者，其結果如何？）必曰（將毋幸。）然而人第以商人某之幸而不死，歸功於一吐。其實得以獲救之原因，不僅此也。設所服之所謂（痧藥水）爲（十滴水）者，其劑濃，所含之麻醉劑，或早致服者於不救？幸而所服之痧藥水，藥力不劇，且以相隔許時，不致十分危險：見機尚早，即刻就醫：並能直承曾服多量之痧藥水，而免多耗醫者之診察。設竟所服之痧藥水並不吐出，以逾量之故，而入於酣醉狀態。迨爲他人發覺之後，又不能證明其是否曾服痧藥水及其他種藥品者；或竟爲他人所給與，至此亦諱飾免過，不肯爲言者。醫者遇之，必多麻煩。若斯種種，余每遇之。即微有中毒症狀者，亦必與以注意。以至奏　之後，證　痛家，　蹈斯轍。</p>

<h3 id="c193">論洋八股 <a href="#c193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— 玄</p>
<p>有（國）斯有（洋）。有了國貨八股，自然也有所謂洋八股。</p>
<p>國貨八股是帝王統一思想的手段。同樣在外國古代現代的有冕無冕的帝王都有那麽一手。對國貨八股而言，那就是洋八股。</p>
<p>這是洋八股的一個解釋。也可以說是洋八股的本來意義。</p>
<p>海通以還，洋貨輸入中國，跟着就擾亂中國本有的社會經濟組織，於是國貨八股失却作用了，不得不乞靈於洋八股。於是我們這裏就有了洋八股了。這種洋八股是要代替國貨八股來（正人心，拒邪說）的，例如法西斯主義便是最新的洋八股。</p>
<p>洋人還有别的八股。例如法西斯主義不大行得通的地方便有社會民主主義這項洋八股。我們中國是是一個複雜的國家，所以也有人輸入這項洋八股，雖然銷路未見怎樣暢達。</p>
<p>此外，土耳其的基瑪爾，印度的甘地，都是（八股名手；）他們的八股别是一種風格，而其與正統洋八股（殊途同歸），則亦旣已成效共睹。因而在我們市塲上也曾大登其癀告。</p>
<p>洋八股還有兩項得意的筆法，就是麻醉和欺騙。這雖是（偏鋒，）力量可也不下於正面的單刀直入。國貨八股本來也有此種手法，但總不及洋八股能把這者研究到變化無窮，神妙莫測。而照最近的事實看來，我們的洋八股學生在這兩上頭却也不弱於乃師了！</p>
<p>現在華盛頓會議快就要開了。說不定就有一篇驚人的洋八股出來，我們等著瞧罷！</p>
<p>洋八股還有别的解釋，但這不在今天題意之内，將來有機會再談。</p>

<p>— 彰雪珍</p>
<p>這兩三年，夏秋間多雨的時候，家裏一有破傘，媽就呌我拿出去給人修，我總是習慣了似的跑到王順修傘鋪去！說是鋪未免誇張了點，那僅只是一間黑暗的小屋，櫃臺已被多年的撫摩弄得滑潤發亮。</p>
<p>（掌櫃的，給我修把傘吧。）</p>
<p>（好呀），一個老頭兒笑吟吟地放下了手裏的活，站起身來，以一種特有的温和來接待他的屋客。看他白髮飄蕭，額頭上滿是皺紋，想來已有六十歲了。</p>
<p>他的慇懃和温和使得我們熟稔了　。</p>
<p>每天上學放學時，我走過店門，總向裏頭探視一下，我望見他的傴僂的側影，他是那樣熱中於工作的，好像那麻線和油紙間就捆着他的生命，他的歡喜。</p>
<p>（上學了，好早呀！）他扭動着鬍子笑了，當他偶然抬頭瞧見了我的時候。他常是勤奮得忘了疲倦，清早上工，傍晚還不休息。</p>
<p>（你在那兒念書？我們阿芸就可惜没福氣，很聰明呢，也識幾個字：：：）</p>
<p>（爸爸，不害羞麽，老那麽誇口。）阿芸臉紅了。俊俏的身材，高個子，臉子有點黑，兩個瞳人光亮亮的，像要攝住人的靈魂似的，是個靜穆的女郎啊。</p>
<p>（阿芸她媽死了六七年了，這也是我們的苦命喲。幸虧鄰舍好，待我們像親人似的，要不然可太冷清了。）</p>
<p>（掌櫃的，生意還好吧？）</p>
<p>（可不一定呢，多雨的時候買賣就好，十天半月没人來也是常事。）</p>
<p>（修得好，手藝可眞不錯，我給你宣揚出去，呌人家多上你這裏來。）我審視着修理好了的傘，他竟那麽能幹，修得像新的。</p>
<p>（哦，不行，太多了我要來不及修，反對不能按時交貨了，不守信用是項壞的。）他皺着眉說，（唉，如果阿芸她媽活着就好了，她很會修，你没瞧見過那好人，我是没有一天能忘了她的好處的。：：：）</p>
<p>（怎麽了，爸爸，不許你再提那些傷心事，媽死了，你這麽發愁，她安心嗎？）我望着她那深藏着哀愁的臉，額前有着一小顆黑痣，更顯得斌媚：眼睛裏含着兩顆晶瑩的淚珠。</p>
<p>（可眞是呢，錢了人死了也就算了。好在阿芸也大了，阿芸搖紗不能帮忙點嗎？）</p>
<p>（她可不能搖一輩子呢，十八歲了，也該：：：）阿芸跑過來堵住爸爸的嘴。是夏天，粉紅的格子布的短褂襯得她更美。</p>
<p>今天，提着書包走過時，看着店面前</p>
<p>掛着白幔，我可楞住了，想起了前天剛拿去的傘，我跨進了店門。</p>
<p>阿芸穿着縞服從孝堂裏出來，眼睛哭得有荔枝那麽大，頭髮像一堆亂柴。</p>
<p>（怎麽，誰？）其實，除了她爸爸還有誰呢。</p>
<p>（前兩天爸爸就說不舒服，可是没留心，誰知道前天一吐一瀉，今天正午便咽了氣，）她抽噎着，（天呵，呌我怎麽過呢：：：）</p>
<p>我找不出一句安慰她的話。這似乎是阿芸所必得熬煎的命運。</p>
<p>阿芸悽凉地望着我走出門，眼睛紅紅的。我忘了要傘。</p>

<p>甚矣！西瓜子勢力之大且遠也！在萬里迢迢的海外已經如此，而况乎國内！我們不必說别的，就拿上海一隅而論，上自住洋房的闊老，下至所謂：（販夫走卒）的家庭中間，幾乎可以說没有一家没有一天不有西瓜子的踪跡。請客宴會，固要西瓜子，就是靠在矮屋門口談閑天的人們，也要手拿西瓜子。我常想：假使有人把全中國每一天所銷耗的西瓜子，和被西瓜子所耗去的時間統計起來，必能得到一個驚人的數目！</p>
<p>從全國上下的躭於吃西瓜子這一點看來，是見中國人的閑散而没有事情做的人之多！因爲吃西瓜子的最大目的，就在消遣時間，和解除無聊這兩件事情上面。平時不必說，連在最緊張的會議席上，有聲電影院裏面，我們中國人也一樣無聊和閑散，一樣非西瓜子不足以驅除寂寞，因此，中國人和西瓜子中間，好像成立了一種不可分離的關係似的。</p>
<p>而且，西瓜子的樣子　能象徵我們中華大國民的風度的。中國人的散漫和無團結，個人主義色彩的强烈，個人中國的對立，傾軋，排　　　，寗可被外人各個擊破，不肯自己和恰，這幾點，不就和我們平日吃的西瓜子一模一樣嗎？</p>

<p>（二十三）國術與外侮</p>
<p>晚清失馭，外患日深，覯閔旣多，受侮不少，於是神拳禦侮之說起，此義和團之禍所由來也。自倭寇來侵，爭言抵抗。飛機大砲，遠不若敵；大刀還斫，偶奏奇功，國人頗誇　之。乃者山東省政府主席韓復　，特定於五月十四日起，舉行全省國術考試，徵求飛轟走　點穴奇材，爲設供具，備奬品，待以上賓之禮，抑且不限省籍，不拘資格，均可前往獻技。（見上月二十日本報蓋外侮待禦，國術斯張，徵之史書，不乏其例。漢書王莽傳，始建國六年，博募有奇技術可以攻匈奴者，將待以</p>

<p>獵槍（續）</p>
<p>紅羅蔔鬚和大哥斐利克斯動身走了。他們穿着平日穿的那種簡單的衣服。他們因爲没有長靴，頗有點失望，可是雷辟克常常對他們說眞正的獵人是看不不起長靴的。眞正的獵人，袴子常是拖在脚跟上。他决不把袴脚捲起。他這樣在爛泥裏，在犁開的田裏走着，一會兒便自然造成了一雙長靴，一直到膝頭；這樣的長靴，堅固，自然，家裏的女僕照例不敢噣毁的。　　（我想你不至於代手回來罷），大哥斐利克斯說。</p>
<p>（我狠希望不至於這樣），紅蘿蔔鬚回答。</p>
<p>他覺得　　襄曩　，狠討厭把槍柄擱在肩上。</p>
<p>（喂）！大哥斐利克斯說，我把獵槍讓你一個人儘興地背着罷）！</p>
<p>（你是我的哥哥啦），紅蘿蔔鬚說。</p>
<p>當一羣麻雀飛過的時候，他站住了，對大哥斐利克斯做着樣子呌他不要再動。那羣麻雀由這個籬笆飛到那個籬笆。兩個獵人以爲麻雀全　睡着了似的，彎着身子，一聲不嚮地走近去。麻雀没有站牢，喞喞喳喳地叫着，飛到别的地方去了。個獵人又站起來，大哥斐利克斯憤　着。紅蘿蔔鬚雖然心在跳着，看來似乎有耐性一點。他害怕着那要證明他的伶俐的片刻到來。</p>
<p>如果他打不中呢！每一回遲誤使他感到鬆快。</p>
<p>可是，這一次，那些麻雀好像在等着他們倆。</p>
<p>（不要放槍，你站得太遠了）。大哥斐利克斯說。</p>
<p>（你覺得太遠嗎）？紅蘿蔔鬚說。</p>
<p>（自然啦！這樣瞄準會要　錯瞄的。我們以爲瞄對了，其實差得狠遠）。</p>
<p>於是大哥斐利克斯現出身來，證明他的話不錯。那些麻雀驚駭着，又飛跑了。</p>
<p>但還留下一隻，站在一條折下的擺動着的樹枝上。牠搖頭擺尾地忙肚子露在外面。</p>
<p>（這個麻雀，我眞的可以打中，决不會錯的。）紅蘿蔔鬚說。</p>
<p>（站開讓我看看。對啦，眞的，你選中了。快點，把槍借給我）。</p>
<p>於是紅蘿蔔鬚被繳械了，兩手空空，打着呵欠：大哥斐利克斯立在前面，代替了他，把槍舉起，瞄準，放槍，麻雀落下了。</p>
<p>這簡直像是一個騙局似的。剛才紅蘿蔔鬚把獵槍靠在胸口上。突然，他的獵槍失掉了現在却又回到了他的手裏，因爲大哥斐利克斯已把獵槍還了他，然後做着狗跑去把麻雀拾來說：　　（你還躊躇不决，快一點）。</p>
<p>（快一點怕還不够罷）。</p>
<p>（好，你生氣啦）！</p>
<p>（難道你要我開心嗎）？</p>
<p>（可是我們旣然打中了麻雀，你還吵什麽呢？你想想看，我們本來並不一定能夠把牠打着的）。</p>
<p>（啊！如果是我：：：：）</p>
<p>（你或我，這是一樣的。我今天打中了，你明天再打中好了。）</p>
<p>（啊！明天。）</p>
<p>（我同你約好。）</p>
<p>（我曉得嗎？昨天晚上，你也同我約過的。）</p>
<p>（我向你發誓，你滿意了嗎？）</p>
<p>（算了罷！：：可是如果我們馬上再尋一個麻雀；我可以試這獵槍。）</p>
<p>（不，現在太遲了。我們回去，好讓媽媽去炸麻雀。我把這麻雀給你。把牠塞在你的口袋裏，蠢東西，讓牠的嘴巴露在外面呀。）</p>
<p>兩個獵人轉身回家了。有時他們碰見一個農夫和他們招呼道：</p>
<p>（小把戲，你們至少没有把那老麻雀打死罷？）</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚受着恭維，便把滿腔怨恨忘記了。他們毫無芥蒂地，得意洋洋地跑到了家，雷辟克一見他們便驚呌道：</p>
<p>（怎麽，紅蔔蘿鬚，你還背着獵槍！你一直背着嗎？）</p>
<p>（差不多一直背着，）紅蔔蘿鬚回答。</p>

<h3 id="c198">五一節與中國勞動節　羅復 <a href="#c198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>（一）五一節的性質</p>
<p>一工作八小時，敎育八小時，休息八小時丨有名的三八制要求，可說是工廠制度發生後丨全　界勞動者力量的第一次表現。</p>
<p>在十八世紀產業革命以前，人類的生產活動除以農業爲主外，祗是運接於農業的家庭手工業　家庭手工業的生產是各個隔離，不相往來，生產的目的，也是大半爲了自足自給，因之生產活動的地方性濃厚，手工業工人並不能聚集在一起，利害關係不相同，自然也不會有共同　　的要求發生，卽不會有和現代樣的勞動　　。</p>
<p>產業革命後，進步的生產披術奠定了工廠</p>
<p>制度的基礎，一因工廠所產的商品打擊原有的家庭手工業，而促其没落，又因新興的工廠需要人　的勞動者，於是農村家庭手工業排擠出來的　對過剩人口，集中於都市的工廠區，大都變　了新興工業的勞動者。他們從還境各不相同的各地農村，走集到一個工廠之中，在同一的空氣中，作着同樣的工作，受着同樣的待遇。慢慢地同一的境遇把他們彼此間原有的差異消麽完盡，他們的性情與意識逐漸趨於一致，這樣，在發生共同利害關　的時候，他們必然的會團結在一起，採取同一的態度，而和以前家庭手工業時期不同。以前彼此不能團結在一起者，至此勞動運動才有發生的可能。</p>
<p>在工廠制度發生之初，企業家爲盡量擴大其生產範圍，必然希望其所投的資本週轉得愈快愈好，資本週轉得愈快，利潤愈大，複生產隨之愈快，生產範圍才能擴大，因之，企業家多是千方百計地盡量節約其成本，加多其出產。又以當時工業的發展不及原來家庭手工業衰落之快，有許多没落的家庭手工業工人，都被拒絶於工廠門之外，這給予企業家以很大的便利，他可以任意的選擇其工人，以最小的工資，使他們作最長久時間的工作，來增加他們的利潤，擴大他們生產的範圍。</p>
<p>所以，在資本主義發生之初，生產拔　的改良反而引起勞動者悲慘的運命。但同時也給予了他們一個機會，卽把他們國結在一起，使他們有同樣的意圖，同樣的要求。歷史上著名的五一勞動運動，便是在這樣的情勢下所形成。</p>
<p>五一勞動運動可以說是資本制生產方法的初期結果，也是世界勞動者的初步要求。歐美的流俗，學者把勞動問題分爲許多枝節，大部的勞動者也常有各種問題可以各個解决的謬見。實際上，勞動問題是資本制生產方法的整個問題，和家庭手工業或基爾特時代，師弟之間</p>
<p>的衝突不同。它的解决須從其整體入手，工作時間不是勞動問題，也不是勞動問題的一部份</p>
<p>，而祇是勞動問題整體中的一環。因爲資本制所生產，工人不是爲了自己而生產，而是祇爲了工資而生產，猶如企業家是爲了利潤而生產一樣。企業家爲獲得更大的利潤，須生產增加，要生產增加，其中一法便是延長工作時間，這樣可不致提高成本，而能獲得更大的利潤。所以，主時問題不能從整個的勞動問題中分裂出來，而要求予以單獨的解决。</p>
<p>（二）八小時工作制的研究</p>
<p>五一勞動運動的惟一要求祇是每日八小時的工作。八小時工作，在嚴格的科學上的意義來說，是並不合理的。根據日本醫生石原磗士的實地研究，結果證明每日八小時的工作，並不是理想的合宜的制度，石原博士研究不同</p>
<p>環境和不同氣候的女工工作時間，對於女工生理上健康的影響，發現就是在温帶的東亞各國，一般地說，八小時的工作對於工作者的健康還是有相當的損害，（見前江灣勞動大學月刊工作時間和季候的關係一文）。到現在，已有許多人知道：卽置工人健康於不顧，工作時過長，並不能增加生產率，有時候，往往反而使工作効力縮少。這種情形，在美國福特工廠等地方，已有組當的證明，最近，蘇聯工業發展的激進，更予以充分的證實。</p>
<p>俄國在革命以前，各地工人每日平均工作時間爲十小時，有的地方，甚且和中國一樣，竟至超過十四小時至十六小時。革命後蘇聯政府盡量縮短工作時間，自一九一八年至一九二六年工作時間逐年减短的情形，有如下列：</p>
<p>一九一八年　每日八·五小時</p>
<p>一九二二年　七·九小時</p>
<p>一九二三年　七·八小時</p>
<p>一九二四年　七·八小時</p>
<p>一九二五年　七·六小時</p>
<p>一九二六年　七·五小時</p>
<p>據報載，，一九二七年蘇聯中央執行委員會頒布每日七小時制法令，最後還縮短至每日六小時，在最近五年中，有許多重要工業，已完全實行每日七小時制，在二十九種重工業與十二種輕工業上，實行此制的，已有百分之八十二至九十二，在木材工業上，達百分之九十，在交通事業上，達百分之七十。但蘇聯自减短工作時間以後，勞動生產率却是有增無减。在有許多實行七小時制的工作上，每月平均生產率增加了百分之八·二，每日與每小時平均生產率增加了百分之二至百分之十一：在石油工業上，每一工人的每月勞動生產率，增加百分之十三·七，同時生產成本減低，工資增高，工人因工作受傷的事件也隨之减少。</p>
<p>不過，在原則上說，工作時間過長，未必能增加生產效力，但如要減短工作時間，同時又提高生產率，那必須以精良優美的（生產技術（爲前提，如没有良好的技術，又没有服務的道德精神，卽不可能。蘇俄的生產關係不同，自非查　通心理上祗爲工資而工作的工人可比，然如其他實行短工時制的，亦祗能見於美國福特工廠那樣生產技術精良的地方，便是爲了這個緣故。</p>
<p>在今日的生產方法之下丨丨企業家祗爲利潤而經營，減短工作時間，實是個很大的矛盾。企業家爲和别人競爭銷路，爲增加個人的利潤，自然生產的成本愈低愈好，也就是工資愈低愈好，工作時間則愈高愈好。好在產業後備軍丨丨失業者衆多，當工人因健康損害而減低工作効力時，儘可把他撤換，而另招富於勞動力的。如生產過剩壓迫，不得不減工時，那末，工資也可依照減少的時間而減少，因之企業家是不肯有法定的短工時制的。歷次日内瓦世界勞工會議，對於工作時間常爲爭論之的，無論企業家或其代表怎樣的說是工作時間減短了，也儘管有多少次的議案，而這個問題終是成爲懸案。</p>
<p>所以，工時問題祇能在整個的勞動問題中解决。勞動運動的終極的歸　，是勞動者的社會解放，並不是局部問題的解决。當時因工廠</p>
<p>制度發生不久，大家對於資本制生產的弊病未見，祗覺得工時過長，乃形成五一運動三八制的要求。現在時過境遷，我們對於五一節的認識，自然不能以工時問題自限了。</p>
<p>（三）中國勞動者對於五一節的要求</p>
<p>產業革命的發生和新興工業的興起，各國的情形並不一致，其中最顯著的是資本主義先進國和殖民地或半殖民地之間的差異。資本主義先進國家的工業是自發的，而（次殖民地）國家如中國，也並不是没有無資本主義國家樣的新興工業之產生，然而不是自發的而是（外鑠）的，卽中國工業的發生是由於各國工業品輸入而引起（尤其在重工業時代的機器的輸入），其發展是在各國工業品的侵略與控制下所進行。這便支配了中國經濟關係，亦卽决定了中國勞動問題的特性。</p>
<p>鴉片戰爭以前，中國經濟還在農村家庭手工業時期，農業爲主要的生產方法，家庭手工業可以相對的自足自給。但自各國的過剩商品侵入中國農村以後，因其價廉物美，眞如水銀瀉地，無孔不入，中國原有的家庭手工業出品與之相抗，自然如秋風掃落葉，完全没落下來。本可自足的中國小農，至此乃不得不仰求於各國進口商品的供給，農業因資金缺乏也日就衰落這樣，中國農民遂不得不和十八世紀初產業革命後英國的農民一樣，從農村中逃亡出來，到都市裏出賣其勞動力，以維持生存。</p>
<p>但是，中國農民流亡到都市，轉變爲工業勞動者，其經過的情形有和英國十八世紀初農民的情形，顯然有兩點不相同的地方。第一，在各資本主義國家，工廠制度發生之初。雖說新興工業所能容納的人口，遠在從農業及家庭手工業中排擠出來的人口之下，但當時新市塲尚多没有開拓，殖民政策也相當的可以救濟這種相對過剩人口而在中國，則農業與家庭手工業是更急驟的衰落，而工業的發展却早已没有了各資本主義先進國那樣優越的條件，而且，因受各國經濟侵略的壓迫，民族工業發展異常困難，那批從農村裏逃跑出來的農民，隨之更難就業。</p>
<p>這一個原因决定了中國勞動者種類及層次的複雜。中國人口的分佈，並不如各資本主義國家樣，主要的分化爲最多數的產業工人和少數的資本家，而是，除一小部份能　身工廠，爲產業工人外，大部的人口，不是轉變爲失業者，就業無定時的苦力，挺而走險的盜賊土匪，以及作爲對外不能抵抗，對内勇於攘戰的軍隊的基礎，便是，把生活減低到匪可言狀，仍進留在農村中，等待着死神的到來。</p>
<p>第二，資本主義先進國家的勞動問題，其中心是對於工人和資本家對抗，而在中國，民族資本主義旣不能充分發達，然不會有　麾根，洛顾費勒，三井，三菱等壟斷全國經濟的大資本家的存在。而且，中國各種勞動者的悲慘命運除爲資本主義國家的侵略而促進者外，各國爲利用中國原料的便利與勞力的低賤，紛紛在中國設廠，一般地說，中國大部的勞資關係，並不是本國勞動者對於本國資本家的關係，而是對於外國資本家的關係。在重工業方面，所有礦業製造業有百分之八十是在外國人的手裏，輕工業如紡織廠麵粉廠等，也都是由外人所經營。如中國有勞資衝突，那末這種衝突，也必然以發生於中國工人與外國資本家之間爲多。這是中國勞動問題的特點，卽就產業勞動者來說，其問題中心也和各資本主義國家所發生的不同。所以，中國勞動問題的癥結，是在於反抗經濟侵略方面。這不僅中國的產業工人如此，就是中國萌芽中的企業家也是如此。他們產業的失敗，都是爲了資本主義國家過剩商品的傾銷與經濟勢力的排擠。在這一點，他們反抗帝國主義的熱忱也和產業工人相同。</p>
<p>中國勞動者因種類不同，對於五一節的認識與要求自也差異，惟在有一點上，如上所述，他們是共同的，卽反抗帝國主義的侵略。他們知道一切悲慘的命運均是帝國主義的侵略所造成。如其没有方法來解决，那末一切都没有辦法。所以中國勞動者對於五一節的要求，固然要求本身的解放，但最要的用其最大的力量。來和全民族共同一致自求解放，抵抗外來的經濟侵略，以求產業之自立自足，站在一條陣線上，切莫自相爭奪，貽人以可乘之機，那末，中國產業末由自拔，勞動者的解放亦恐徒成　餅了。</p>
<h3 id="c199">農村經濟破產中之農民　何冰 <a href="#c199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>（一）中國農村經濟破產過程　拉迪克曾指明增加賦稅與商品侵入爲中國農村經濟破產之主因。夫商品侵入固爲帝國主義侵略之表現，而賦稅增加亦未始非帝國主義間接所促成。直接間接，中國農村之破產，莫不受帝國主義之影響。中國自鴉片戰爭以後，賠欵外債，與日俱增，其最後負担，必以增加賦稅形式，轉嫁於農民身上。各資本主義國家爲爭奪在華市塲，莫不卵翼軍閥，爲其爪牙，利害衝突，卽增加内戰。因之，中國的賦稅據人調查，從民元到民國十七年已增加了百分之三九·三·並以過剩商品之源源輸入，促進農村手工業之没落，使農民生活失其相對之獨立性：又爲原料之掠奪，使原有種植物，爲之改變，如號稱（厥土上上）之陜西，近有（棉花進了關，小麥上了山）之諺，東北數省，烟草裁培面積，與日俱增，農民自給植物之稻麥，逐漸爲其排斥。此種原料植物種植之普遍，更促中國小農不能不依賴市塲，亦卽其生存命運，由國外大資本家遙爲操縱，如一九二九年世界經濟恐慌，影響所及，東北小農死於朽爛大豆之間者，日有多起。</p>
<p>（二）平時中國小農生活　所謂農民，層次頗多，上自以地租爲生之地主，下自窮無立錐地之雇農，彼此生活固不能同日而語，卽以普通所謂自耕農，半自耕農，佃農等而言，層次亦至爲複雜，如中央研究院調查無錫農村，發現地權形態，不下四十餘種，地權不同之農民，生活自必大相逕庭焉（中國農桭經濟研究之發軔）。惟於此層次複雜之農民羣中，吾人仍不能發現其重心之所寄。如民國十六年國民黨中央土地委員會之調查，中國農户耕稼而積在一畝至十畝者，人數在百分之四四，而占有地則僅百分之六。無論此數是否可信，而中國小農佔優勢，實乃不可諱之事實。卽如一九二八年東亞同文會出版支那年鑑所載，中國土地分配十畝以下者佔總面積百分之四二·三而言，亦足證中國小農之普遍。而此種狹小土地，又非集中於　處，常有不滿十畝之農家，其土地分散於各處，竟有五六塊之多，每塊距　常在二三里之遠（見農村社會學大綱）。</p>
<p>小農者，貧農也。其耕田面積之分碎狹小，由來有自。常人以爲中國之柝產制度，爲階之厲，實則主因所在，農民貧乏而已。根據各</p>
<p>方調查，如蕪湖，如鹽山，如成都，如北平近郊，以及經營副業較易之上海四郊，所有農民，大部均爲負債；有人以每年一百五十元收入，作爲農民生命線，而一般言之，各地小農每家每年少有收入超過一百五十元者。以前旅外農民之匯欵，略足救濟於萬一，近則此項來源斷絶，家庭手工業收入早已消滅，農民所持者，惟借貸而已。</p>
<p>然借債非一切農民均有此種資格，無論私人借貸，典當，以及向合作社貸欵（僅少數地方有之），均須有所抵押，農民所有抵押品，主要者惟土地而已。但際此天災人禍，紛來沓至之秋，農民告貸，與日俱增，如前江蘇農民銀行放欵，農民以之從事於生產者少，而以之償還高利借貸及購買食物者多，是以農民土地，因無力償債而被没收者，比比皆是，如據喬做明氏調查崑山，南通，宿縣三處，農民耕地面積减少情形，以一九○五年爲基計　分之一百　至一九　四年竟有减少至百分之四一者（崑山有耕農），各地災荒區域，更無論矣。　　　　土地爲農民生產要具。亦卽生命之　寄。此而不保，平時生活情形，可以想見。就食而言，各地農民均以值錢農產出售，以價賤者留作　用一見武昌縣農村調查報告，甚　飮食隨　而異，華北農民　冬　之　，　　　氏　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　具他未之或計。陜西山西各縣農民，常有出售（隔宿之糧），以供賦稅捐租，其景之慘，無以復加，</p>
<p>鴉片紅丸等毒物，近已普及於各省農村，始作俑者，固爲當地軍警地痞，包　勒種，從中漁利，而各地農民之貧乏，亦實有以致之。就作者所經歷各地，農民呑食鴉片紅丸者頗不乏人。此無他，飮食不精，營養不足，健康日就衰退，非如此卽無以工作，豈農民自甘墮落哉？飲食如此，其他可知。據各方調查，卽號稱富庶之農村，如上海北平等近郊，農家每年無衣服費用者，常有超過百分之五十，其他用費，自更鮮矣。</p>
<p>（三）農民生活惡化之現象　中國災荒之普通與廣大，可謂世界各國無其北倫，如一九二九年西北之旱災，一九二○年中部之水災，以及一九三二年東南之（豐災）（卽豐收成災，江蘇江北各縣，均稱之爲豐災，）莫不喪失人口數千萬，淹没農產無其數。災區境内，人獸相食，草木無餘，固亦意中事也。災荒雖之出諸天然，實則莫非人禍，森林被伐　凈，水利年久不修。皆爲災荒云主因，而小農日就窮乏，農業生產資木剝削盡凈，實亦造成災荒之要因。分析近數十年來，災荒次數最多之區，亦卽帝國主義侵路最甚，農民窮乏化程度最深之地（見新創造農業專號，）卽不難明見其實情。流俗者主改良生產爲改進農村之具，而事實昭示，社會制度不良，豐收亦可成災，固無有於生產之改進也。</p>
<p>災區農民生活，固不具論，卽非災區，大部農村亦多與災區相似。浙西以蠶桑衰落，去年也曾設有人市，夫携其妻，父帶其女，輾轉呼號，論斤出售，與大旱時之西北，情形固無或異。</p>
<p>揚州田賦風潮，農民曾毁縣城；無錫搶米及老婦（吃大户風潮，也曾喧擾日久。作者去年去吴江盛澤，數百年來號稱（日出萬綢之鄉，全家自殺，幾無日無聞。最近浙江因採用改良蠶種，又激起農民暴動。查去年農民因無一元購種蠶本，竟忍春光坐老，今改良種價倍於土種，全部採用，自非農民力所勝任。無論其是否有何内幕，而以之爲改進農村，無那亦不思之甚？近談（歸農村去問題者，似頗不乏人，然事實昭明，（觀念論）者之主張，不難被證爲一種空想而已。</p>
<p>（四）農村破產與勞動問題　中國農民問題與勞工問題，息息相關，未能或離，亦可曰，今日吾人重視勞工問題，不若轉而注意農民問題之爲愈，蓋農村經濟之破產，實乃勞工問題之關鍵也。</p>
<p>因帝國主義商品之侵人，苛捐雜稅之榨取，人禍天災之頻仍，使農民不安於業，非流亡無以爲生，據各地調查，向稱靜如死沼之農民，近年來移動之急驟，可方之爲怒濤狂瀾，蓋非流亡出外，卽無以爲生也，各處離村流亡之農民，男者多爲勞工，女則多爲娼妓，否則，非輾轉死於溝壑，卽流入盜賊軍隊之途，加甚農村經濟之崩潰。</p>
<p>然中國經濟之特性，僅係殖民地或（次殖民）性質，卽產業受帝國主義者之控制是也。因之，農村雖就破產，而都市工業却亦未能有合比例之發展，農村中擁擠出外之人口，新興工業未能吸收其什一，此等人口，如爲匪爲軍，皆可威脅都市之治安，破壞工業之興盛，如爲失業者，則增加勞工問題之嚴重。蓋失業者愈多，工人就業愈難，工時愈長，工貸也必愈短也。</p>
<p>就工業　　，中國爲產業落後國家，乃各帝國主義國家傾銷商品之尾　，所謂國際貿易，不過容納過剩商品及貢獻原料而已。欲求中國工業之發達，工業品自必惟有推銷於國内，國内唯一市塲，農村　　。　　民貧困　甚　買　　　，是則欲求工之興盛，勞工問</p>

<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>守產，是什麽名詞？你若望文生訓，認做了守候生產的穩婆，那便大誤而特誤了。</p>
<p>但看，各種表册的職業項下，除却塡寫農，工，商，軍，政，學界以外，很有人塡着守產兩字，這便是守着祖宗遺產，做那吃不盡用不完的少爺班子，也算是一種很光明很正大的職業。</p>
<p>偶　明人温氏母訓，｜（註）伊說：（一豈有子孫專靠祖宗過活？天生一人，自料一人衣祿；若肯高低各執一業，大小自成結果。今見各房子弟，長袖大衫，酒食安飽，父母愛之，不敢言勞；雖使先人遺百萬資，坐困必矣！）不料十七世紀老太太的家訓，却會至今顚撲不破。（自料）人衣祿，這便是人人應有的天職，靠祖宗過活，已是可羞；還加着傲睨一切，掮着一塊少爺班子的招牌，央社會上自稱守產，只怕這般職業不見得十分光明與正大吧。</p>
<p>温老太太說的：（長袖大衫，酒食安砲），還是十七世紀少爺班子的結習現在呢，狂嫖濫賭不算外，吸幾筒福壽膏，討幾個如夫人，被那骨董鬼兜售些（假虎邱）的骨董，似是而非的書畫，已算是守產階級中的穩健分子了。其他，不可說丨不可說丨</p>
<p>似這般的守產，在十七世紀時代，已不免有温老太太所說：（坐困必矣）的危險；（因今之道，無變今之俗），豈但（坐困）二字，所能包括？少爺班子，醒醒吧。</p>

<p>一九三三年五月一日，莫斯科舉行盛大之勞働紀念禮，繼以遊行，參加者十萬人。蘇聯各地，均停止工作，舉行紀念。</p>
<p>柏林全市特别戒嚴，褐衫黨全體動員，防遏暴動。街市間遍佈障礙物，以阻遊行。正午，有共產黨一小隊，在囗處集結示威，以磚石洋瓶，擲入某建築物窗内。褐衫黨聞訊馳至，遂起衝突結果，雙方各有死傷。入晚，尚有數處發生小衝突。</p>
<p>意大利戒備嚴密，全國平靜，工人照常工作。</p>
<p>法國雖有集會紀念，但情緒冷淡。</p>
<p>西班牙京城瑪特馬德及全國各地，熱烈舉行紀念，入晚，與王黨有小衝突。天主敎堂，有三處被毁。</p>
<p>倫敦警探動員，嚴防失業工人與饑民團示威。但除三數團體舉行紀念會外，全市平靜無事。國會討論失業救濟金問題。</p>
<p>美國退伍軍人，擬集結華盛頓請願，但未成事實。全國工人一律休假，各市街道間滿佈醉漢。</p>
<p>日本各地，均有騷擾，尤以東京大　爲甚，軍警頗活動，結果，被檢舉者一百七十餘人，某敎授及某名流亦被捕。</p>
<p>上海有反動份子，擬從事破壞某項建設，以戒備嚴密，陰謀未遂。下午，南京路，小沙渡，有學生工人模樣者數小隊，呼反動口號，散傳單，捕獲嫌疑青年二人。霞飛路一帶電杆木上，發現反動標語。華界入晚平靜。提早戒嚴。</p>

<p>女子像一種商品，在未嫁時，由父母保管，身體髮膚，不得有所玷污毁壞，以供將來賜顧者好受用。旣嫁時，便是丈夫的所有物，顚之倒之，鞭之策之，可以隨意，歡喜了，固可拿來當洩慾器，嫌惡了，也可棄置著，當冷貨看待。失偶時，體面的人家，做伊家長的，可可當伊是不祥之物，關閑在室裏，直到老死爲止。窮苦的人家，就當　存貨，急急物色買主，賤價出售。</p>
<p>女子養在鄕村窮苦人家，好像是一錠金元寳。最大了，伊的賣身錢，做弟弟的娶親費固可以，做父母的喪葬費，也可以，甚至償債也無所不可。</p>
<p>女子嫁了窮苦的丈夫，好像是一頭穿鼻的牛，打煞，做煞，餓煞，：：：：到蓋棺才已。</p>
<p>女子養在都市的富貴人家裏，在父母看來，像是心頭肉，搖錢樹，拳上珠。在兄嫂看來，像是眼中釘，賠錢貨，笆外　。</p>
<p>女子嫁了闊綽的丈夫，好像是廢物，走一步路，要坐車轎。拿一件東西，要呌僕婦，天熱了要靠電風，天冷了要恃爐火。</p>

<p>甘泉燭天獵火，煮桑乾咽水。北鴻到問訊前塵，綺　寒勒梅蕊。見說半空飛霹靂，兒童笑說天花墜。指王城塚，胡笳不攪歸思。初訊東風，撼户動模，苦抛家浪子。遠勞盻　促歸程，雁來人總不至。棄珠崖，廟謨默契，歛秤手，休勞彈指。恐因循，歧路徬徨，又生他意。　　沈沈歇浦，醉舞酣歌，奈輙驚　寐。機軋軋，憑壕未穩，横掃風雨。肉　攖鋒，枕戈呑淚。求援路絶，景沙夜閙，枯魚遙乞西江滴，任星軺瑣尾悲通瘁。迎鬥肅客，敎人人人室登堂，說甚春秋皮裏。興亡有責，魯國孤嫠，也抛紅蹙翠。今又報幽燕肩背，俯瞰秦城，飮馬源乾，宿烏雲起。呼天無路，倉皇戰守，癰疽深患延肺腑，恐長江天塹終難倚。傷心不客宵吟，當哭長歌，淚珠滿紙。</p>

<p>他笑道：聽說他還有一個姑娘，怎麽不見呢？趙自强笑道：我們這位老弟臺，怎麽着也忘不了女人。田青道：人生除了衣食住三大要素，不就是女人嗎？趙翁笑着走了出來道：田連長，你還有什麽不稱心？聽說你在城裏有個女學生的好朋友，你還談别個女人作什麽？田青笑道；喝！了不得，老人家也會說出這樣開玩笑的話來。趙自强掏出鐵壳子表來看了一看，笑道：我們先進城去罷，回頭到我這裏來吃午飯，統共是半日假，不要糊裏糊塗的過了。田青道：我們剛侳下，就要走嗎？殷得仁笑道：你這人有些口是心非，分明恨不得飛到城裏去，你倒不願馬上就走嗎？大家哈哈笑着，走了出門，正趕上了長途汽車，也只二十多分鐘，就進了西直門了了。趙自强道：關大哥家裏，小田去不去呢？我看你不必去罷，嫂子面前，給你帶個信兒去問好，也就得了。田青將手向額角上比了一比，笑道：你們到了關大哥那裏，别再開玩笑，一提起人家討親，我們這位關大哥就要反對的。去是一定去，特意進城來拜年，焉有不去之理？趙自强道：玩笑是玩。我又要說句公道話了。關大哥他是爲了媳婦兒女累夠了，皆以提起來就腦袋痛。其實那個能像他那樣子，生下一大羣兒女呢？田青扯了一扯衣擺，笑道有我們二哥道句話，我又要向愛情之途上，拚命去進攻了，三個人在大街上說着，只聽到嘩啦啦一聲響，響入了半天。殷得仁偏了頭聽着道：什麽玩意兒？這麽大聲音。趙自强道：這有什麽不懂的，又是學生老爺喊口號。說話時，只見半空裏白紙招展，黑黑的一羣人頭，在白光下擁了上前來。趙自强拉着兩個人，向街旁邊退了幾步，讓這陣風頭過去。只見最前面，是二三十名除了武裝的警察，後面使是三個大個兒學生，一個拿着傳話筒，兩個撑了大竹竿，兩面横着一幅白布，上面寫着銅盆大的字，收復東北打倒日閥。（五八）</p>

<p>— 妙神</p>
<p>有人說；美國的女權很發達。然與其說是女權發達，還不如說是美國婦女受社會上特殊的待遇，比較切當些。因爲美國婦女在政治經濟方面，並没有怎樣的平等，（可說是比較的平等）不過婦女在社會方面，却受一般男子特殊的抬舉。丈夫對待妻子，奉之如神明譬如說；相偕出外的時候，丈夫要替妻子措皮鞋，披大皮，開門，自已則跟隨在後邊，如果妻子有東西，還要替妻子提東西。做妻子的大都視這種事爲當然，故毫無感謝的意思。因此有人說，美國的丈夫是奴僕。</p>
<p>世界上婦女的地位最低，而自視亦最卑的，要算日本了。日本的婦女，馴服如一頭綿羊，丈夫的言話，不但是命令，簡直是聖旨！做丈夫的無論怎樣不好，做妻子的將不該指摘他的不好，因爲有損婦德。丈夫可以任意把妻子打駡，妻子呢，當丈夫歸來的時侯，照例仍要跪了迎接他的。（下跪是日本的最敬禮）因此有人說，日本的丈夫是暴君。</p>

<p>約摸是半個月以前的一個深夜，也許是破曉的清晨了，忽然室外傳來了一陣的（叭叭叭）的爆竹聲，活像一二八禍變時密雨似的日本機關槍，而且恰又發生在同一地段—寳山路ＸＸ坊，這就使我在糢糊迷離的睡眠中，彷彿在看同時放映着的兩幅景片，好在一二八久已過去，寳山路也又新建了好些座不相聯絡的洋房，雖然日本機關槍正轉向華北緊奏着，但上海總算又可以歌頌一聲（天下昇平）了。</p>
<p>翌晨起來，走向衖堂外去泡開水，回轉來，在衖口的右邊牆上發見這麽幾個大字：（×府喜事由此進），使我又猛然憶起昨晚的爆竹聲，畢竟是爲了自己天　四点鐘　場的藝師　　工廠的女工上上</p>
<p>的生活太恐權，没閒情去巡訪，看這Ｘ府究竟是那一號門牌？喜又喜到那一等程度？只管急急的走回自己的寓所。</p>
<p>白天，衖堂裏還是一樣的清靜，只除了晨起七八時的馬桶洗禮，九十萬時菜販的一陣嘈雜的喧擾；並且也没有什麽了不起的緊急的消息傳來。</p>
<p>黄昏臨了，室外忽傳一陣敲門聲，一息過後，二房東走進來商問我：（Ｘ號裏Ｘ府做喜事，適才派來了二位代表來請我去坐坐，請問先生阿要送禮？）</p>
<p>接着是連聲的（是大亨！）（是大亨！）别的我倒不在意下，（大亨，）（大亨）一息間竟在我的腦海裏打了無數的旋迴。</p>
<p>入夜以後，果然衖堂裏的情形完全異樣了，不待說，樂鼓聲，呌喊聲，喧笑聲是混成一個團，一陣一陣的傳來，連我的窗下也時時起了急緊的脚步聲，穩不住我走出了門，呵，只見衖堂的殿尾，人頭擠得像麥穗似的擺動，高掛的汽油燈剌剌的放射着白熱的光芒。呵，喜事就在那兒，但怎樣也擠不進去，眞個有些（水洩不通）的懷恨，仰眼看看左右的一些窗口，也全都塞滿了人，再不能攀爬上去了。（好呀，再來一個呀！）是在玩幻術，抑在唱崑曲，或是玩ＸＸ？都没有把握作肯定。忽而坊外拖進來了四部嶄新襯着通亮的電光的包車，自然坐在那裏面的四大駕，就是（玉腿酥胸）的天仙似的舞女了，果然聽到了這麽一聲呌喊；（舞星到了！）這才使我着急，但着急是一樣無用，我也就怏怏然走回來了，接着二房東也怏怏然走回來了，說：（看是眞好看，可惜人太多，看得實在弗愜意！</p>

<p>The Outrage of Disregarding the Sanctity of Treaties Must End</p>
<p>Improving the Situation Depends Entirely on Joint Action of All Countries</p>
<p>International Trade is the Lifeblood of Modern Civilization</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Washington, 29th - US Secretary of State Hull gave his first speech after taking office at the International Treaty Association tonight, stating that the international situation in which treaty obligations are disregarded and the sanctity of treaties is trampled upon must end and be replaced by healthy new international relations. Most of this violation of treaties and disregard of ordinary contracts can be said to be due to the world's economic situation. In recent years, the world's economic situation has moved rapidly towards a terrible danger, and this economic situation is the result of economic closure by many countries. Therefore, the success of various plans to improve the situation depends entirely on whether all countries can take joint action to restore trade. Today, fair and friendly relations must be rebuilt between countries, and regular trade relations must be completed to avoid dangerous economic, military, and political disputes in the future. Not only is there disregard for treaties and contempt for contracts in various parts of the world, but force is being used or will be used to resolve them. He added that prices are declining in the world market, and they are in a state of bankruptcy. The internal affairs of various countries are even more difficult. Politicians must modernize their economic policies. Sound international relations depend on a considerable degree of controlled exchange of goods, no less than on well-worded diplomatic documents, because international trade is the lifeblood of culture, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="e14">It is Said That the Washington Conference Really Discussed the Far East Issue <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>It is Said That the Opinions of the United States, Britain, and France Have Converged, and the Japanese Political and Business Circles Have Been Greatly Shocked</p>
<p>▲ Hualian News Agency, Tokyo, 30th - According to the Eastern Newspaper, a solution to the Sino-Japanese dispute has been discussed in earnest at the Washington Preparatory Conference. As a result, the three countries have reached a consensus on the Far East issue. As soon as the news reached Tokyo, the business and political circles were even more shocked. The responsibility is mostly blamed on Foreign Minister Uchida's scorched-earth diplomacy. Foreign Minister Uchida used the struggle between the yellow and white races as the basic principle of the Asian Monroe Doctrine, so before Asia moved, the white race first realized the danger and took a unanimous anti-Japanese action. Japan is now in a state of siege, and the future is very worrying. Such a tide of sound is now spreading among all social strata and people in Japan. Therefore, it is expected that the movement to overthrow the cabinet will be promoted due to dissatisfaction with Uchida's diplomacy. The crisis of the Saito Cabinet is no longer a problem of the resignation of Finance Minister Takahashi, but is caused by opposition to scorched-earth diplomacy.</p>

<p>(Beiping) Huang Jie came to Beiping and visited He twice to report on the situation at the front, request replenishment, and ask for operational advice. Huang considered the importance of the front defenses and decided to return to the defense with Chief of Staff Shi Honglie and staff members tonight. According to reports, the battle on the front was very fierce yesterday. A certain unit of our division was transferred back to Nantianmen yesterday to join the frontal battle. A certain high ground in Nantianmen was slightly retreated by our side last night due to the fierce artillery fire of the Japanese army, and a new type of position was built and firmly defended at a certain place. A certain plan will be used to recover it in one or two days. I visited He last night to ask for instructions and returned to the defense today to command our troops and continue to resist the Japanese. I only ask to kill a few more enemies and die to fulfill my military duties. Our division is responsible for Nantianmen this time. Fortunately, the generals and soldiers have done their best to fight the enemy's fierce artillery fire day and night to defend the land. More than half of the dead and wounded have now been replenished and are now living a bloody life on the front line. The reason for the retreat of the Japanese army in Luandong is related to international relations. The Washington Conference will be held soon and is paying close attention to the Sino-Japanese battlefield. The Japanese side deliberately withdrew its troops to confuse the situation and leave some room for strong defense. It is said that the Japanese army at Gubeikou has two divisions and three to four thousand Koreans. (29th Dispatch)</p>

At present, all our generals are determined to resist for a long time, and their morale is very high. Yu met with Minister He in the plains and talked about the security of Beiping and Tianjin, and considerable arrangements have been made.

<h3 id="e27">A Certain Important Person Discusses the Inside Story of the Xinjiang Incident <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Jin Shuren Cannot Evade Blame</p>
<p>The Japanese Have Been Coveting it for a Long Time</p>
<p>The Government Cannot Afford to Neglect it</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain important person familiar with the situation in Xinjiang discussed the serious unrest there. The population of Xinjiang is generally composed of three groups: the Han Chinese, the Hui people, and the "Chantou Hui" (a derogatory term for Uyghurs). The Hui people are the most numerous, followed by the Han Chinese, and then the Chantou Hui. However, there is no unity within these groups, with different factions and a lack of knowledge due to education and transportation issues, leading to frequent disputes. The specifics of this incident are difficult to ascertain since no telegrams were sent from the region. However, based on telegrams from Ambassador Yan and others to the government, Jin Shuren can hardly evade responsibility. While serving in Xinjiang, Jin took advantage of its location in the northwest and poor transportation to act without restraint, causing deep suffering to the people. Once it erupted, it became uncontrollable. According to telegrams from the Hui people in Beijing, they absolutely obey the central government but are dissatisfied with Jin Shuren. Xinjiang is located in the northwest, and transportation is difficult. To get there from here, one must first take the Jinpu Railway, then transfer to the Longhai Railway, from Xi'an to Lanzhou, and then take a car. After the car road ends, it becomes a small path, and one must ride donkeys and horses for several weeks to arrive. After Jin became the governor, he never repaired this transportation route, fearing it would be disadvantageous to him if transportation became convenient. This is secondary. What is most hateful is that before Jin went to Xinjiang, there were public wells along the road from Lanzhou to Xinjiang, one well every few miles, with several households living near the well. People traveling there could rely on well water to quench their thirst and stay overnight in nearby residences. However, after Jin arrived in Xinjiang, he ordered his subordinates to fill in these public wells one by one, making it difficult for residents who relied on well water to live nearby, forcing them to migrate. Those traveling to the province had no water for themselves or their animals to drink due to the long journey, and there was no place to stay overnight along the way, making it impossible for even troops to go there. As a result, Jin never reported the situation in the province to the central government for years. When the government heard about the Xinjiang incident, it planned to send someone to investigate and make arrangements. However, after considering the implications of sending an official representative, it planned to organize an inspection group to investigate in Xinjiang under the guise of an inspection. While this was being discussed, the Xinjiang incident escalated, and Jin fled, so this idea was abandoned and replaced with a special envoy. After the government consulted with Chiang Kai-shek by telegram, Huang Musong was considered the most suitable special envoy. Huang went to Jiangxi yesterday morning to meet with Chiang and seek instructions on the envoy mission. After returning to Beijing in two or three days, he will depart. As for the envoy team, the government will send several more important officials to accompany Huang, as the situation there is complex. Only through the joint efforts of those familiar with Xinjiang can effective results be achieved. Personnel are being selected. Relevant agencies will send personnel to participate in the future. The most difficult aspects of dealing with the province are: 1. financial difficulties, 2. a lack of education, 3. inconvenient transportation. Assistance from all sides is necessary to improve Xinjiang. Japan has been coveting the province for a long time and has recently been very active. The people there have a weak sense of national identity and are easily exploited, making the situation very serious. How can the Chinese people underestimate this? The government should take special measures and handle it properly to avoid any unexpected incidents. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Since its establishment in February, the Constitutional Draft Committee of the Legislative Yuan has been drafting a constitutional draft to lay a permanent foundation for the country's fundamental laws. It has gone through four stages under the leadership of President Sun, proceeding step by step and widely soliciting public opinion for reference. The first phase of work was originally scheduled for June, but the National Assembly was to be convened in October of this year, so the time was shortened. Therefore, as of April 30, the research phase of the first phase has ended, and the first draft will begin on May 1. During the research phase, the main parts of the constitution have been divided into several issues for discussion, with a total of twelve meetings and more than a dozen subcommittee and joint meetings. After careful planning and discussion, either clauses were drafted or principles were determined. The total work results can now form a complete volume. (30th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

For example, the Jinpu and Beining railways will be connected with the Pingjin customs in the north, the Jinpu and Jiaoji railways will be connected with Qingdao in the east, and the Jinpu and Longhai railways will be connected with Tongguan in the west. The Longhai Railway can also be transferred to the Pinghan Railway for connection with Hankou. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Zhang Yichou, Director of the Department of Commerce, discussed his observations on the US abandonment of the gold standard. The decline in export trade figures last year was the most significant since the European War. After the great flood, there were the September 18th and January 28th incidents, and the instability in Rehe in the second half of the year. The Pingjin area was constantly in turmoil, and the communist bandits in the interior had not been completely suppressed, leading to the decline of industry and commerce, the withering of all trades, and the decline of the countryside, which affected the stagnation of foreign commerce. Although the fall in silver prices was the best opportunity to promote export trade, the influence of these complex problems led to the opposite result. Now that the United States has abandoned the gold standard, the price of gold has fallen, and the price of silver has risen. As usual, China's exports will inevitably suffer losses. However, in today's economic panic, incredible contradictions often occur. Whether China's export trade to the United States will follow common sense and be unimaginable, or whether it will gradually improve as a result, is unpredictable. We should not be optimistic or pessimistic at this moment. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(1) Shadows Over the Future of the World Economic Conference</p>
<p>The Washington "fireside chats" have temporarily concluded with the successive returns of the British Prime Minister and the former French Prime Minister. On the surface, the three major powers, Britain, the United States, and France, have reached a considerable understanding on currency issues, tariff wars, trade relations, and war debts, although there are no concrete solutions. The detailed plans have been left for the World Economic Conference in mid-June. Therefore, capitalist economists and the general public are optimistic about this, believing that it can overcome the current economic panic, and there is a possibility of improvement in the new market. However, the fundamental issues of antagonism between Britain and the United States, such as investments in South America, European markets, and Eastern markets, are not discussed, so the actual problems between Britain and the United States still exist in a confrontational form. It is still not eliminated, and how can it be effective to seek consensus through empty words?</p>
<p>Moreover, since the Ottawa Conference of July 21 last year, the British Empire has achieved new unity within itself, from the British mainland to its overseas autonomous territories and colonies. There is a strong tendency to integrate with the British mainland in order to overcome its economic contradictions and break the centrifugal political forces. Apart from the Soviet Union with its special form, France's European alliance is only nominal. The United States has only historical awareness and geographical convenience, but has failed to form a close alliance. The rising Japan, after occupying Manchuria, has been making every effort to link Japan and the Northeast to form its so-called "Japan-Manchuria Economic Alliance" to confront the Soviet Union in the north, control the United States in the east, threaten China in the west, and invade Southeast Asia and India. Therefore, Britain and Japan cannot but be in a position of opposition in economic terms. Although Britain is an advanced capitalist country, its industrial base is mostly in cotton and wool textiles, which is one reason why it cannot be reconciled with Japan. Secondly, British ships sailing overseas mostly carry coal. Many ports from the Strait of Gibraltar to Singapore and Hong Kong do not produce coal. In northern China, Kailuan and Fuzhong, operated with British capital, are the largest, which are opposite to the Japanese Kyushu and Fushun coal mines. This is another reason why Britain and Japan cannot be reconciled. Thirdly, although the areas of British and Japanese investment in China are different, their commercial relations are an irreconcilable struggle. The competition for investment along the Yangtze River is particularly fierce. This is the third reason why the economic interests of Britain and Japan cannot be compromised. However, politically, there are common ground in defending against the Soviet Union, competing with the United States, and suppressing the Chinese national revolutionary movement. Therefore, although the economic opposition between Britain and Japan is becoming more and more acute, the political understanding between Britain and Japan continues. However, economic relations are very important. Take the abolition of the Indo-Japanese Treaty as an example.</p>
<p>(2) The Abolition of the Indo-Japanese Treaty</p>
<p>India is indeed Britain's treasure trove, supplying Britain with raw materials and absorbing a large amount of British investment. However, Britain and India are far apart, and in recent years, the national movement has erupted, and the centrifugal tendency is becoming more and more obvious. Therefore, Japanese goods have taken the opportunity to enter, and the commercial relationship between India and Japan has become closer. Let's list the total value of Japanese goods imported into India in the past two years as follows.</p>
<p>Imports from Japan</p>
<p>1931 110,357,000 Japanese yen 133,165,000 Japanese yen</p>
<p>1932 192,491,000 Japanese yen 116,865,000 Japanese yen</p>
<p>Among them, the import of Japanese cotton cloth into India occupies a major position. The quantity and amount are as follows.</p>
<p>Import Quantity</p>
<p>1931 403,936,000 square yards 49,818,000 Japanese yen</p>
<p>1932 644,458,000 square yards 80,626,000 Japanese yen</p>
<p>The tendency to increase year by year is very obvious. India is the best market for Japan. As for Japan's exports to India (cotton yarn), it is also worth noting. The quantity and amount are as follows.</p>
<p>1931 16,094 bales 5,592,000 Japanese yen</p>
<p>1932 50,836 bales 14,343,000 Japanese yen</p>
<p>The export of Japanese cotton cloth to India is the most promising trade. Last year, the value of cotton cloth alone exceeded 80 million yen. With the addition of cotton yarn, the total value has approached 100 million yen. Now, the Indian government will abolish the Indo-Japanese (Commercial Reciprocity) Treaty on October 10 of this year and implement anti-dumping tariffs. What will be the impact on Japan? The Japanese textile industry has gathered to discuss and plans not to buy Indian cotton in retaliation. However, Japan does not produce raw cotton domestically, and Indian cotton can still find markets in Britain itself, so Japan buying 1.5 to 1.6 million bales of Indian cotton less each year will have a very small impact on India. And India can still seek ways to make up for it in Britain and other places. With the restriction of heavy taxes, cotton cloth and cotton yarn have lost the vast market of India. In this period of deepening economic panic and at the time of active aggression against China, this kind of slow economic blockade is indeed a great blow to Japan.</p>
<p>Although Anglo-Japanese relations are very close politically, economic competition is becoming increasingly fierce. The implementation of increased tariffs in India is only the beginning of the struggle and a preliminary attempt to consolidate the economic alliance within the British Empire. In the future, the struggle between Britain and Japan for the Chinese market may be even more intense than today's tariff war.</p>

<p>Economic Conference Preparatory Committee Opposes US Proposal</p>
<p>Roosevelt Begins Negotiations with Various Countries on Reciprocal Trade Agreements</p>
<p>▲National News Agency, London, 29th The World Economic Conference has been decided to be officially convened in London on June 12. At the same time, British Foreign Secretary Simon announced that the British King will personally preside over the opening ceremony. According to reports, a total of 54 countries, including Soviet Russia, will participate in this conference to save the world from the economic disaster. The opening date was agreed upon by British Prime Minister MacDonald and the US President in Washington and was approved by the Organizing Committee meeting today. US President's representative Davis attended the meeting and proposed a gentleman's agreement on a tariff truce. According to the US President's instructions, it was proposed that the invited countries informally agree not to increase tariffs or change import duties from the date of the meeting to the closing of the meeting. However, several representatives opposed this proposal, believing that they could not agree to this truce until the tariff system had been comprehensively reorganized. Therefore, the committee argued that its authority could only prepare for the Economic Conference and had no power to make recommendations to the countries. It was decided only to notify the countries that the United States would propose this truce at the opening of the Economic Conference. Therefore, the US proposal was not included in the Organizing Committee's report.</p>
<h3 id="e47">The US State Department is Quite Disappointed <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>▲National News Agency, Washington, 29th The US State Department was quite disappointed tonight to hear that the US-proposed immediate tariff truce proposal failed to be accepted by the London Economic Conference Organizing Committee. This morning, the US President instructed Davis, the representative stationed in Europe, to submit this proposal. Unexpectedly, although Davis complied with the order, the Organizing Committee believed that it had no power to make recommendations to the countries and could only notify the countries that the United States would propose a tariff truce at the opening of the Economic Conference. As a result, Davis's proposal that no further restrictions should be imposed on trade and the flow of international finance from today onwards failed to be implemented. Tonight, Undersecretary of State Philip stated that the United States made this proposal in the hope of alleviating the fear of further interference in international trade among the world's industrial and commercial sectors, so as to give another boost to increasing business and raising prices. He firmly believes that if there is such a universal agreement, it will be effective immediately. According to reports here, France may accept the truce proposal under certain conditions. Although France agrees to the truce, it is deeply concerned that the international exchange rate will fluctuate sharply before the Economic Conference is convened due to the maintenance of the gold standard, so it has to use tariffs to protect its financial position. Therefore, it hopes to retain some freedom in terms of tariffs.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Five Economic Truce Clauses <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 29th The World Economic Conference is scheduled to be held on June 12 at the New Geological Museum on South Kensington Street in London, at which time the British Emperor will hold the opening ceremony. This announcement was made by the Economic Conference Preparatory Committee after a meeting at the British Foreign Office today. The preparatory committee was chaired by British Foreign Secretary Simon. US representative Davis stated to the committee that the US representative will propose a tariff truce at the opening of the World Economic Conference, and the proposed clauses will be sent to the invited countries at the same time for prior inspection. According to a detailed view of the US proposal submitted by Davis, the US proposal is not only a tariff truce, but it is more appropriate to call it an economic truce. Its basis is nothing more than advocating that no new obstacles of any kind should be established during the conference to hinder commerce. The US representative will propose at the meeting that there should be no (1) new tariffs, (2) exchange rate restrictions, (3) import and export quotas, (4) prohibitions, and (5) dumping. The duration can be determined by the General Assembly. However, the US government advocates that this truce should remain in effect until the governments of the countries concerned ratify the agreements established by the General Assembly.</p>

<p>▲National News Agency, Washington, 29th A plan will be submitted to Congress next Monday, the content of which will authorize the President to begin negotiations on reciprocal trade treaties. The first country to negotiate with the United States will probably be Canada.

<p>▲Havas, Paris, 29th The French government is extremely pleased with the cordial and frank talks in Washington. If the devaluation of the US dollar does not exceed 15% of the value of hard currency, then France can accept the international compromise on a tariff truce for the sake of public interest. If so, then the issue of repayment of war debts due in December last year and June this year is difficult to regard as a political conclusion before a more general agreement is reached. Moreover, the French side, for the war debts due and to be due, after clarifying the conditions proposed by the US Congress for resolving the war debt issue, may approve the repayment of one installment, but must first be sure that the United States can solve the war debt with a fair method for each debtor country before it can do so.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Japan Considers Countermeasures <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>▲Tokyo, 30th Dispatch from the Japan United Press - The government will hold the final meeting of the six-ministry joint conference at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on May 2nd to decide on Japan's approach to the economic and technical aspects of the Washington Conference. Political issues will not be subject to a definitive policy. The government will issue instructions to its representatives at any time, depending on the attitudes of the various countries at the conference table. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is considering two countermeasures for the Japanese government's approach to the Washington "Little London" Conference: one is to actively advocate, and the other is to respond to the issues raised. The following policies have already been decided internally: A. Japan's active advocacy: (1) Establish the principle of freedom of commerce; (2) Regarding the Far East issue centered on the Manchurian problem, Japan originally opposed the London Conference discussing the Manchurian problem. However, at the Washington Conference, it intends to voluntarily explain the actual situation in the Far East to the new U.S. government, expressing that the current state of (Manchukuo), the many improvements that have occurred before this event, and the establishment of (Manchukuo) are the cornerstones of stabilizing the Far Eastern political situation, etc. It also argues that China's anti-foreign boycott movement has become a constant source of unrest and instability in the Far Eastern market. B. The Japanese government's attitude towards the opponent's claims: (1) The United States advocates the expansion and strengthening of the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the United Kingdom and France all agree to this move. If such an agreement is to supplement the Kellogg-Briand Pact, Japan will not actively oppose it, but it must reserve the interpretation of the right of self-defense, which belongs to absolute autonomy; (2) On the issue of unconditional restoration of the gold standard, Japan cannot approve it unless the gold reserve ratio of each country's currency is reduced to an appropriate level; (3) On the reduction of general tariff rates, Japan's tariff system was established earlier than other countries, and its tax rates are also lower than the current tax rates of other countries, so it opposes a uniform reduction by all countries; (4) On the increase and stabilization of silver prices, the United States is a silver-producing country, and the United Kingdom has silver reserves in India. However, Japan not only does not produce silver domestically, but its neighboring countries, such as China, have a silver standard, so it does not want to raise silver prices and would rather stabilize them. An illegal increase in silver prices may seem to increase the purchasing power of silver-using countries on the surface, but in reality, it leads to a rise in the cost of silver production in various countries and chaos in the entire economic sector, so Japan has to be wary of it; (5) However, Japan unconditionally agrees to the adoption of silver as the standard currency to establish a bimetallic standard system.</p>

<p>The League of Nations Has Repeatedly Sent Experts to China</p>
<p>To Assist in Various Construction Projects</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Chinese government, in accordance with the Technical Cooperation Plan established between China and the League of Nations in 1931, will appoint Mr. Sommerhuel, formerly of the British Ministry of Labor, as an expert for Chinese civil administration agencies, and Mr. Landzh, director of telephone affairs in Frankfurt, Germany, as an expert for Chinese telegraph and telephone agencies. In addition, it plans to appoint several people as experts on postal issues. This cooperation plan also stipulates that China will appoint League of Nations experts to reside in China to serve as liaison between the League of Nations and the National Economic Council of China. In addition, Mr. Lassman, Director of the Health Section of the League of Nations, has also set sail for the East. (Havas Dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) China has agreed with the League of Nations on a technical cooperation plan and appointed various experts, as reported in another telegram. The details of this matter are as follows: In January 1931, the Chinese government notified the Council of the League of Nations that China had organized the National Economic Council to engage in national construction and hoped to utilize various technical agencies of the League of Nations. The methods of utilization include: the League of Nations sending personnel to reside in China to serve as general liaison between China and the League of Nations; or, in the event of special plans, China requesting the League of Nations to send experts to China to assist; or the League of Nations assisting China in training civil servants; or the League of Nations assisting China in selecting talented experts to help the Chinese government develop education and find ways to facilitate the exchange of knowledge between Chinese and foreign cultural institutions. This cooperation plan of the Chinese government was accepted by the League of Nations in May 1931. The Health Section of the League of Nations has sent several experts to China to conduct temporary research, with a particular focus on medical education. Dr. Borci has been assisting China in organizing health administration and central hospitals for three years. The Cultural Cooperation Section has sent several commissioners to China to investigate educational conditions. After the completion of the investigation, the Chinese side sent several educators to Europe for investigation. The League of Nations also selected three professors to go to Nanjing Central University. The Communications Section of the League of Nations studied methods of flood relief for China, as well as restoring flooded land and reforming the Greater Shanghai port plan. It also sent many engineers to engage in extensive road construction plans. Several thousand kilometers of these roads have been completed. The engineers have also established training schools for Chinese engineers. Regarding financial issues, after Sir Surde contacted the Chinese government, the League of Nations sent financial expert Mr. Quelong to China in February. His mission is for a period of six months. Regarding the flood issue, the League of Nations recommended Sir Simpson to China. After his mission was completed, he returned to Europe. Cooperation between China and the League of Nations involves all issues, so the number of experts sent by the League of Nations is extremely large. It is necessary to appoint another person, in addition to the various experts, to reside in China and serve as liaison. His duty is to report to the Chinese government on how the various technical organizations of the League of Nations can be utilized by the Chinese government. (Havas Dispatch, 29th)</p>

<p>▲London, 30th Dispatch from Reuters - Various countries are now actively preparing to prevent incidents on May Day. On this day, the Red Army in Moscow will march through the streets, and celebrations will be held in all cities and towns of the Soviet Union. Germany will honor workers with nationalistic significance. The country will be closed on this day, but labor demonstrations are prohibited. Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss has ordered the people to avoid going out unnecessarily to avoid conflicts. Machine guns have been placed at key points in Vienna, and barbed wire barriers have been set up on several streets. Communist demonstrations are prohibited in both Germany and Austria tomorrow. Bulgaria's Sofia is taking stricter precautions. All those suspected of being Communist leaders and organizers, as well as many labor councilors, have been temporarily detained. Communist and Socialist parties in other countries are mostly planning celebrations, and the government is only taking routine precautions and has not issued special orders. However, in several South American countries, due to the large number of unemployed people and the tendency of labor to stir up trouble, the authorities have great power to curb incidents.</p>
<p>▲Paris, 29th Dispatch from Havas - Grand Duke Cheril, the leader of the former Russian royal family who fled to France, published a letter to the Russian people on May 1, Labor Day, severely criticizing the politics of the Communist Party and the Third International in the fifteen years since the Russian Revolution, saying that the Russian people, whether at home or abroad, want to overthrow the Communist tyranny and will soon be victorious.</p>
<p>▲Tokyo, 30th Dispatch from Reuters - Tomorrow is Labor Day. Laborers of the left and right wings in Tokyo will hold separate parades here to celebrate. About 6,000 laborers from the right wing and about 4,500 from the left wing will participate in the parade. The police department has sent 4,000 policemen to monitor the labor parades.</p>
<h3 id="e65">The Disarmament Conference Becomes Deadlocked Again <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Germany Ignores Requests from Britain and France</p>
<p>And Insists on the Principle of Equality in Armaments</p>
<p>▲Geneva, 29th Dispatch from Reuters - Germany's attitude towards the Disarmament Conference and its demand for equality in armaments within a limited period of time have endangered the conference with becoming deadlocked. There is still no progress in this situation today. Chairman Henderson, British representative Eden, and German representative Nadolny met this evening, but still failed to ease the tense atmosphere. It is reported that the German government has reiterated its amendments, ignoring the requests of Britain and France.</p>
<p>▲Geneva, 30th Dispatch from Havas - The Military Quota Committee of the Disarmament Conference will announce on Sunday that certain parts of the German police will be included in the calculation of military quotas. The committee seems to be deciding by a majority vote to include reserve police officers and students in the Disarmament Convention. The same applies to police stationed in barracks, but not to police who do not live in barracks. Chairman Henderson of the Disarmament Conference invited representatives from Britain and Germany in the evening to try to compromise. The German representative, Nadoni, insisted on the various demands made by Germany and refused to budge. People in Geneva are increasingly convinced that the German delegation will not make concessions until the United States, Britain, and France jointly issue a statement next week.</p>
<p>▲Berlin, 30th Dispatch from Havas - A semi-official document commented on the Washington political talks, saying that if the United States abandons its policy of (not participating in any joint action), it will have a significant impact on the work of the Disarmament Conference. If the United States has already given France such assurances, then the German delegation to the Disarmament Conference will have to insist even more on its demands.</p>
<p>▲Berlin, 29th Dispatch from the Guomin News Agency - Today, German Aviation Minister Goering issued a letter to the people of the whole country, advocating the organization of a national aviation salvation association to protect the security of the country and defend against enemy air raids in wartime. Goering said that the countries surrounding Germany all have thousands of bombers, while Germany has almost nothing. The danger is extreme. Therefore, aviation salvation is a matter of vital importance to the German people. To complete the great plan of air defense, it is necessary to unite the people of the whole country and pool their wisdom and strength. This is the main purpose of establishing a national aviation salvation association to awaken the people's attention.</p>
<p>▲Berlin, 29th Dispatch from Havas - Germany's newly built giant aircraft with 2,500 horsepower held a grand naming ceremony today. President Hindenburg personally attended the ceremony. Prime Minister Hitler did not attend because he had to go to Zengcheng. Prussian Prime Minister Goering issued his order on his behalf to name it (Hindenburg). President Hindenburg, accompanied by Deputy Prime Minister Papen and Defense Minister Blomburg, arrived at the Tunberg-Hofer training ground to review the National Defense Forces honor guard. Goering said in his speech that Germany's talent excels in peaceful struggles and surpasses all countries. This is another proof of this.</p>
<h3 id="e66">The Cuban Revolution <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>A Provisional Government is Established in US Territory</p>
<p>Fear and Panic in the Cuban Capital</p>
<p>▲Havana, 29th Dispatch from the Guomin News Agency - Revolutions suddenly broke out in several places in Cuba tonight. It is said that the province of Oriente is actually in the hands of the revolutionary army. At the same time, a well-organized provisional government is waiting in Miami, Florida, in the United States. As soon as it receives a telegram from the revolutionary army in the country, it will immediately return home by plane to command military affairs. As for the government, it is now urgently mobilizing government troops, loading them on wheels, and transporting them to Santiago in hopes of saving the crisis in Oriente Province. At the same time, President Machado has ordered a strict inspection of mail and telegrams. However, according to telegrams received here, the revolutionary organization seems to be widely spread, with Oriente Province as its activity center. This sudden attack on the San Luis military camp, which is an important railway intersection, 40 miles north of Santiago, is said to have destroyed all government military defenses. In addition, many other towns have been occupied. The revolutionary army is now concentrating at its designated location. However, the government, in addition to acknowledging the seriousness of the situation, has not released any other news. Although the capital of Havana appears peaceful, people are in fear and panic. The authorities have sent government troops to defend key points to prevent former President Minocal from landing. It is said that Minocal claimed that as soon as the revolution breaks out, he will immediately return home by plane with his two sons. He also said that the incident in Kemaisuai Province a few days ago was not done by his party, and that the revolution he planned would be a large-scale undertaking. It is also heard that just before the outbreak in Oriente Province, President Machado received a letter requesting him to resign and cede the presidency to a provisional president. Machado ignored it and told his followers that he would definitely not leave office before his term expires next year. It was also heard tonight that the revolutionary organization had rented many empty ships and transported arms and ammunition from foreign ports to small, remote ports in Cuba, secretly unloading them. It is believed that there are no fewer than ten representatives of the former president in the capital of Havana, but the government agencies have not yet been able to detect them.</p>
<h3 id="e67">US House of Representatives Leans Towards Inflationary Currency Trends <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>The Proponents Hold the Majority</p>
<p>The Opponents Consolidate Their Lines</p>
<p>▲Washington, 29th Dispatch from the Guomin News Agency - The situation of currency inflation in the United States is far from being resolved, so the price of the US dollar fluctuates greatly. The US dollar fell sharply again today, and its value compared to other countries' currencies is actually only 83 cents (a drop of 17 cents). No one can predict what kind of opinion the president holds about inflation. Even though it has caused fierce conflicts within the party in the Senate, the president has not said a word to relieve the doubts. His recent statement was only that on the day the United States abandoned the gold standard, he would allow the price of the US dollar to find its own level. Therefore, financial experts today said that the path taken by the president is obviously to make the US dollar more expensive among the people of this country and cheaper abroad. So far, it can be said that the goal has been achieved, because prices have been gradually rising. The anti-inflation faction in the House of Representatives has today begun to organize a consolidated line. The strength of both sides can probably be seen after they begin to consider the agricultural relief bill and the inflation clause on Monday. Although the number of representatives from the states that usually oppose inflation and improving the status of silver is very large, Speaker of the House Rayner said today that the pro-inflation faction still holds the majority.</p>
<p>▲New York, 29th Dispatch from Reuters - After the rural relief bill and its inflationary amendments were passed in the Senate, speculation at the New York Stock Exchange was rampant today. Many securities rose in price from one pound to five pounds or more. The volume of transactions was about 2.85 million shares. This is a new record in many months for a Saturday.</p>

<p>Finance Minister Takahashi's Resignation is Determined</p>
<p>Members of the Seiyukai Faction Will Resign Together</p>
<p>▲Tokyo, 30th Dispatch from the Dentong News Agency - The Japanese political situation may become complicated when Finance Minister Takahashi resigns. However, Prime Minister Saito is well aware of the attitude of the Seiyukai, so in early May, he will summon Finance Minister Takahashi to try to persuade him to stay one last time. However, Finance Minister Takahashi's intention to resign is firm, and there is little hope of persuading him to stay. All members of the Seiyukai faction will definitely resign together. Therefore, whether Prime Minister Saito's attempts, such as the reorganization of the cabinet, can proceed smoothly is a question. If there is a mistake, the resignation of the entire cabinet will be discovered, so the political situation in May will be a time of many events.</p>

<p>▲Tokyo, 30th Dispatch from the Dentong News Agency - In view of the recent tendency for student ideological problems to occur frequently, the Ministry of Education has established a policy to sweep away red professors from various universities. Professors suspected of being red are being secretly investigated. Those who have no relationship with actual movements will have their freedom to study and learn respected and will be tacitly approved. In the future, even those who have no relationship with actual movements will have their red professors resolutely punished. The dismissal of Professor Longchuan Xingchen of the Faculty of Law of Kyoto Imperial University is the first step in the implementation. Recently, Professor So-and-So and Professor So-and-So of Kyushu Imperial University will also be punished in the form of resignation. If this is the case, the Ministry of Education's suppression of red professors will gradually unfold.</p>
<p>▲Tokyo, 30th Dispatch from the Dentong News Agency - In order to prevent direct action by the left and right wings, the Ministry of the Interior plans to newly form a special security team. The cost for half a year is 200,000 yuan, which has been approved by the previous parliament. At the cabinet meeting on the 28th, it was decided to appoint two police superintendents and ten police inspectors, which will be implemented no later than October. Once the organization is successful, major cities such as Osaka and Kyoto will be the first to implement it. The specific plan is as follows: The security team is directly under the supervision of the police chief and is intended to suppress group actions and vicious police incidents. Each squadron is equipped with one machine gun, as well as Japanese swords, pistols, bulletproof vests, etc. They are distributed in the security team headquarters, prime minister, cabinet members, prominent officials, ambassadors, etc. A large team is formed, under which there are a large team headquarters and four squadrons.</p>

<p>The Tokyo Asahi Shimbun reported on the 25th that the abrogation of the current Japan-India trade treaty is a major expression of British oppression of Japan. However, the initial main purpose was only to exclude the Japanese yarn industry. Now it has advanced to exclude Japanese ships. Even the Japanese ships in the rice transportation agreement from Rangoon to Bombay last year are now being notified by the Indian Minister of Commerce that they will expel Japanese ships from coastal trade in India. The notice is based on Article 324 of the British Customs Union Act of 1853 (British ships may directly or indirectly prohibit or restrict foreign navigation vessels). If it is implemented, the losses suffered by Japanese ships will be very significant. In the past, the exchange rate between Japanese ships in India, Australia, Australia, Britain, Canada, Britain, and Canada, and Australia has been very favorable. Now, because the British-Japanese trade treaty has been abolished, Britain has even gone so far as to prohibit Japanese ships from trading on the coasts of British territories and India. According to information obtained by the Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Tokyo National News reported that India's anti-dumping bill was originally scheduled to be implemented six months after the revision of the Japan-India trade treaty, but because of the powers stipulated in the cotton industry protection law, heavy taxes will be levied on cotton cloth immediately. Therefore, the textile industry has caused great panic. If a special tax rate is implemented, the export of Japanese goods to India will inevitably be completely wiped out.</p>

<p>▲London, 29th Dispatch from Reuters - According to news from Moscow, the two British engineers, Thornton and MacDonald, who were sentenced to three and two years of imprisonment, may not have any hope of being released based on the amnesty order for political prisoners. This is because the Soviet Union does not want to issue such an amnesty, which would damage its dignity. Moreover, according to precedent, Russian amnesty orders must be issued on November 7, the anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Russian Republic.</p>

<p>Japanese Troops at Gubeikou Exceed 30,000</p>
<p>The Reclaiming of Lulong by Commander Weng Zhaoyuan's Division</p>
<p>Special dispatch from Beiping: The Japanese army, withdrawing troops from Luandong, is deploying all its strength to attack Gubeikou, aiming to seize Nantianmen, occupy the high ground, and attack our army from a commanding position. On the 21st, the No. 8 Watchtower suffered a devastating blow, as the watchtower was destroyed by Japanese artillery fire and reduced to powder. However, the Japanese did not succeed. On the morning of the 26th, over 2,000 Japanese and puppet troops crossed the Chao River by wading through the water and launched a fierce attack on the No. 8 Watchtower, Jiepaiyu, and Nantianmen, supported by over ten aircraft and artillery fire, desperately trying to break through. Our troops calmly responded to the attack, with soldiers mostly lying in trenches, using machine guns to sweep the enemy. On the south bank of the Chao River, Japanese corpses piled up like mountains, and the river water turned red. By 4:00 PM, the Japanese had deployed reinforcements and launched another assault. The artillery fire continued incessantly, and the battle became increasingly fierce. Our ambushing troops, taking advantage of their rested state, waited for the enemy's morale to weaken and, at a signal, bravely launched an attack. The enemy was caught off guard and fled towards Chaoshuiguan. Yesterday (the 27th) morning, Japanese aircraft again flew over Nantianmen, Shixiazhen, and other places, dropping bombs. After noon, they launched a fierce artillery attack on Nantianmen. The sound of artillery rumbled throughout the night, but the Japanese still failed to capture it, indicating the intensity of the battle.</p>
<p>The Japanese army is full of schemes, unpredictable and ever-changing. For days, they have been turning the East Railway issue into a serious matter, on one hand, claiming they will use force against Russia and actively increase troops in northern Manchuria; on the other hand, moving their elite troops from Luandong to attack Gubeikou, intending to take the route of Miyun and Shunyi to directly threaten Beiping and Tianjin, annexing North China and completing their so-called "North China State" conspiracy. They have also dispatched another large army to invade eastern Chahar from the Rehe border, adopting a strategy of gradually breaking through our anti-Japanese front, dividing the whole into parts, trying to make our army unable to attend to both the head and the tail, and then driving puppet state rebellious elements to cross the border, thereby concealing their actions from the eyes of the world. Currently, the troops attacking the Gubeikou area include the Pumu, Nishi Yoshiichi, Suzuki, and Kawahara units, totaling over 30,000 men. It is also heard that the Japanese side has a new military plan, deciding to organize future invading armies into smaller detachments to harass separately, instead of concentrated attacks by entire divisions. This move is nothing short of releasing a smokescreen to the international community, further preventing other countries from paying attention, and then acting arbitrarily and doing whatever they want. Therefore, in recent days, troops have continued to be transported from Japan to China, with most heading to northern Manchuria and a small part heading to the various passes of the Great Wall to increase their strength. At present, in the Luandong area, there are also four to five thousand puppet state troops, with one part under the command of Li Jichun and the other part under the command of Zheng Yanhe. Zheng's unit is called the 7th Brigade, but it actually has less than three thousand men and is mostly reorganized from bandits, lacking discipline.</p>

<p>Its organization lacks a unified system, and they are the first to collapse in battle. The Japanese army is forcing this kind of rabble to bear the brunt of the battle, really just using them to eliminate them. This morning (the 28th), according to a certain source, the Japanese army, having repeatedly attacked Gubeikou without making progress, in recent days, in addition to increasing heavy troops continuously arriving for reinforcements, a large amount of supplies and military equipment have been transported from Shenyang to the various passes of the Great Wall. This morning around 5:00 AM, as the sky was just dawning, the Japanese army concentrated artillery fire and continuously attacked our Nantianmen and Daxiaoxinkailing positions. More than forty heavy cannons fired continuously for over five hundred rounds, without stopping for a moment. Smoke filled the air, and the firelight lit up the sky. On the right flank, the Japanese army launched a fierce attack on our position with three infantry columns. Our commander-in-chief, Xu Tingyao, led a large army to the front line to supervise the battle at dawn. All the soldiers fought with a hundred times their usual courage, and a cry of killing shook the valleys. They also dispatched a division of troops to attack the enemy from the rear. The Japanese army, unaware, was in the midst of attacking forward when their lines suddenly became chaotic. Our army attacked from both the front and the rear, cutting off the head and tail of the Japanese army, causing many casualties. The enemy at Nantianmen and the No. 8 Watchtower, under the cover of artillery and aircraft, also attacked us. The battle was exceptionally fierce, and our army responded calmly, but the sacrifices were also extremely heavy.</p>
<p>On the front line of the Beining Railway, Shi Shian's regiment of He Zhuguo's army advanced towards Changli on the 26th. On the night of the 27th, the Japanese army retreated from the east gate, and our army immediately advanced to Changli. On the 28th, the seventh passenger train on the Beining Railway heading east started from Beiping in the morning.</p>

<p>Although tickets were only sold to Anshan, the passenger train can reach Changli. Telephone and telegraph communications between Qinhuangdao and Tianjin have been restored. The railway authorities have sent workers to repair the tracks on the Qinhuangdao-Changli section, and passenger and freight trains will soon be able to reach Qin Island. Our garrison troops and troops at Beidaihe and other stations are continuing to advance. The Japanese troops retreating from Changli are retreating along the railway line towards Haiyang and other places. Our army may not pursue them relentlessly, but all the troops are still adhering to the principle of resisting any enemy attack, and their morale is very high. As for the reclaiming of Lulong, it is reported that since Li Xingcun's division of Shang Zhen's army reclaimed Qian'an at 9:00 AM on the 23rd, that afternoon, Weng Zhaoyuan's division actively advanced towards Lulong. Weng even took the lead and rode in a car to the Caijiafen area to supervise the troops, and then advanced to Lulong at dusk. The three hundred puppet troops in Lulong City had already fled towards Changli the day before. Moreover, after Lulong was occupied by the Japanese army, they set up their headquarters in the city. Our army once fired artillery shells that hit their kitchen, and after Commander Weng's troops entered the city, they still saw the rubble and scattered tableware. There were many ronin in the Japanese troops. The residents of Lulong City had all fled. During the eight days the Japanese army was in the city, they raped, looted, and massacred on a large scale. Because most of the young women in the city had fled before the city fell, even older women were not spared. It is said that there was an old woman there,</p>
<h3 id="e77">Wounded Soldiers Waiting for Transportation at the Front <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Who was over sixty years old, was also raped by the Japanese army. There was also a young woman surnamed Tang who could not escape and was gang-raped to death by seven or eight Japanese soldiers. The belongings and money of middle-class families were mostly looted, causing extremely heavy losses. On the 24th, Weng summoned the city's residents and held a mass meeting in the city's parade ground. Weng gave a speech, roughly saying that the army is the people's army, and every citizen is a commander of the army, and all have the responsibility to supervise and urge. Soon, a representative of the people took the stage and spoke, and when he said the phrase "became slaves of a fallen country for eight days," his voice broke with emotion, which shows the high level of public outrage.</p>
<p>Japanese aircraft dropped leaflets on the banks of the Luan River on the 21st, and the language was extremely absurd. Here are a few excerpts to give a general idea: (1) Yellow compatriots, wake up yourselves. Let the people of East Asia govern East Asia. Reflect on yourselves. Destroying China is using barbarians to control barbarians, a vulgar policy of warlords. Looking at history, what did China lose by relying on Europe and America, and what did it gain? (2) Do you know the Japanese army? The Japanese army is a peace-loving divine army. The Japanese army is a righteous army that maintains justice. The Japanese army's bravery is number one in the world. The Japanese army's weapons are unparalleled in their sophistication. The Japanese army cooperates with the Manchurian army to suppress bandits. The Japanese army is friendly to good people and will never disturb them. The Japanese army is determined to punish rebellious bandits. (April 28th)</p>
<h3 id="e78">Observations from Shixiazhen - Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Geng Ya <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Enemy Aircraft Bombard Everywhere, Turning Towns into Scorched Earth</p>
<p>The Battle at the No. 8 Watchtower Position is the Fiercest</p>
<p>Gubeikou is the only natural barrier that Beiping must pass through to reach Chengde. It has steep mountains and cliffs, naturally dangerous, and the Great Wall winds along its crest. Apart from this pass, there is no other path. Watchtowers are built on the pass, towering majestically in the strategic location. The passage under the tower can only accommodate one car. This is truly a natural barrier that one man can hold against ten thousand. However, the Rehe army abandoned its duty and retreated timidly, making a big mistake. The pass, along with Lengkou and Xifengkou, bid farewell to the motherland of thousands of years and fell under the iron heel of the invaders. As the reporter looked remotely with a mirror at the high ground of a certain defense line to the left and rear of Nantianmen, the form of the natural barrier was clearly visible. Recalling the grand plans of the Qin Emperor and the value of the Great Wall in national defense throughout the generations, I cannot help but feel the contrast between the past and present. The reason why the reporter suddenly recorded this is because it was the third day after leaving Beiping and passing through Sunkouzhen, Niulanshan, Wangjiazhuang, Miyun City, Jiusongling, Chaozhuzhuang, etc., and arriving directly at Shixia, which was also one of the most memorable days of the trip. The first day was a tiring journey, the second day was almost entirely spent in a dungeon where the sun never shone, and the third day was thanks to the kindness of the aircraft (of course, the Royal Army), which gave me a decent opportunity to do some observation and interviews. It was truly a stroke of good luck in misfortune. The day before, after leaving Beiping, a strange fragrance suddenly wafted into the air during the tiring journey. I looked up and saw pear blossoms on the roadside, filling the gardens and valleys, mixed with peach and plum blossoms, like clouds and brocade. The driver said that the place was called Lihua Pit, about fifty or sixty li from Beiping City. The ladies of Beiping City, tired of the urban scenery, often come here to enjoy the fragrance of wild flowers. Before he finished speaking, I caught sight of eight or nine large cars connected end to end, fully loaded with wounded soldiers, stained with blood, lined up on the right side of the road. The pleasure of admiring the pear blossoms was suddenly replaced by an indescribable pain. The national crisis is so severe, yet there are still ladies who are intoxicated in the fragrance of roses. If they were to see the bright red blood blossoms opened by these brave soldiers, I wonder if they would feel the same way. In an instant, the pear blossoms filling the gardens and valleys were no longer visible. The future is uncertain, and the wheels of the car, speeding forward like a whirlwind, I don’t know how many more times they must spin before reaching their destination. This road is slightly flatter than the road to Xifengkou, because that road has more sand, while this road has more dirt, and there are no scattered stones. However, the dust that blinds the eyes and blocks the road is even worse. Along the way, there were many soldiers who could not stand walking and wanted to hitchhike. The drivers all refused sternly. Later, some even tried to grab the front of the car. Only by honking the horn loudly could a bloody path be cleared and we sped away. I suddenly felt a pebble fly past my ear and hit the lower leg of a platoon leader who was snoring loudly against the back wall of the car. It made a loud bang. The platoon leader was in great pain and exclaimed in shock, "Who is it?" A soldier replied, "It's an old villager (a common term for soldiers in the north) who wanted to hitchhike." A certain section chief in a short coat also chimed in, "That's right, it's your armed comrade." Everyone burst into laughter, and the soldier laughed even more uncontrollably. Unexpectedly, the platoon leader, filled with pain and shame, suddenly swung his huge palm and slapped the soldier's cheeks hard. The soldier retaliated with all his might, showering him with fists. The two wrestled into a ball, almost falling out of the car. After being persuaded to stop, one had blood and foam pouring from his mouth, and the other had his oblique robe torn like the Panchen Lama's, but they still glared at each other, wanting to vent their remaining anger. After the battle temporarily ended, the atmosphere in the whole car was silent for a long time. The wheels of the car turned roughly, making them especially loud. The inferior nature of the Chinese people (brave in private fights) can be found anytime, anywhere. It is truly heartbreaking. Arriving at Jiusong Mountain, the car went down a slope. On both sides of the mountains, there are solid</p>
<p>Defensive works. The bank of a river ahead is also densely covered with barbed wire, and deep trenches are dug, enough to overturn enemy tanks and armored vehicles and protect the safety of our anti-Japanese soldiers. A soldier at a certain military station said that this is the third line of defense. Although it is far from the front line, enemy aircraft often come to scout, fearing that they will take advantage of the side roads. Even in Miyun City, which is in the rear, enemy aircraft often come to scout and bomb. On the morning of the 18th, fifteen aircraft flew to the city, soaring in the sky and dropping bombs like rain, about a hundred in total. The whole city was almost a scorched earth. Even the church gospel hall, which hung a foreign flag, was bombed. Fortunately, most of the residents and soldiers took refuge in underground caves, but there were still thirty to forty casualties, and even more livestock had their abdomens torn open and their intestines flowing out, which was extremely tragic. Before he finished speaking, the sound of gongs was suddenly heard in the village. The driver knew that the iron birds were coming and immediately ordered everyone to get out of the car and take cover, and covered the car with green cloth as a talisman. No sooner said than done, the aircraft had already suddenly arrived directly overhead. Fortunately, they did not drop any bombs. After a knowing look, they immediately went their separate ways. When starting the car, the lame platoon leader, who had been mistakenly hit by a stone, arrived late, and needed help getting into the car. But when the aircraft suddenly arrived and everyone quickly took cover, he was like a different person. Although the incident was comical, no one dared to laugh openly, fearing that he would roar again. From here on, the number of troops marching or being transported by car gradually decreased, and they were scattered rather than concentrated. Arriving at Shixia late at night, I got out of the car and visited Mr. Che Qinghe of the Support Association's office, and saw that he was preparing to send a telegram saying "The war situation is unfavorable, and the safety of North China is at stake tonight." I secretly calculated in my heart that if we were to be defeated tonight, what would become of us? Entering the city, there were few people on the road, and most of the shops had their doors bolted shut, with the words "No one inside" written on them. Arriving at the headquarters of the 〇〇 Division, I suddenly heard the phonograph playing "Fourth Son Visits His Mother." A certain adjutant said that this was also a gift for consolation. When the music stopped, Division Commander Huang Jie came out to meet me. After a few words of greeting, he made the following statement, roughly saying that before the 21st, there were only small contacts. Since that day, the enemy has been launching fierce formal attacks on us. The No. 8 Watchtower on the left wing of our Nantianmen defense line was first besieged by the enemy at dawn, with a force of about a thousand. Our stationed troops fought bravely and were all sacrificed under the enemy's fierce artillery fire. The No. 8 Watchtower position was lost. In the evening, a battalion of troops tried hard to counterattack, killing their way to the top of the mountain and recapturing five watchtowers. At dawn on the 22nd, the enemy again sent a machine gun team of five to six hundred men to reinforce, and under the fierce bombing cover of aircraft and artillery, they continued to concentrate their attacks on our No. 8 Watchtower position. Battalion Commander Nie Xin fought bravely and died in battle, and the deputy regimental commander was injured. Subsequently, the deputy battalion commander, company commander, and platoon commander died in battle one after another. Although no one was commanding, the soldiers still fought individually, vowing not to retreat. However, due to excessive casualties, they regained and lost the position. Today, we have counterattacked again, advancing and retreating several times. Both sides have suffered heavy casualties. I was almost shaken by the fact that our artillery fire was not as good as theirs, but fortunately, the morale of our troops was very strong and they responded calmly. In addition, a platoon from our special operations team, which had been missing for two days, returned from outside the pass today and also participated in the battle. With the arrival of other reinforcements at the same time, they managed to hold the line and stabilize it as before. It is the natural duty of soldiers to defend the country. Sometimes, despite exhausting all their strength, they are limited by the situation, and their strength and wishes are contrary. I think the people of the country will be able to forgive them. Public opinion must be fair, and right and wrong must be true. If you encounter the enemy's provocations and malicious slander, do not believe them lightly. At present, there is no way out for the people of the country, especially our soldiers holding guns, except to fight to the death. Fortunately, my soldiers are clearly aware of this due to the pressure of the environment. Currently, our army's ammunition and supplies are still being supplied, and their morale is quite high. However, after this continuous four-day and night battle of sacrifices, if the environment permits, we will have the opportunity to reorganize and replenish. With this profound experience, we will surely be able to achieve even better results in killing the enemy in the future. It was already past nine o'clock when we finished talking, so I said goodbye and left. The whole city was dark and without lights, and the use of flashlights was also limited. I groped along slowly, and the guard at the city gate shouted the password at the slightest sound. Strict vigilance was everywhere. The mountain of the No. 8 Watchtower is twice as high as Nantianmen, and has eight corner towers of the Great Wall, two of which have been destroyed by the enemy. The terrain is extremely dangerous, and it is a place that the enemy must seize and that we must defend. The place was originally only stationed with a company of a certain regiment of Commander Huang's division, which led to the loss due to underestimating the enemy. Although repeated counterattacks were made later, at the cost of the highest sacrifice, it was ultimately of no help, which is a pity. The impact of the lost ground on our army will be discussed later. (April 28th, in Shixiazhen)</p>

<p>Wuhu Dispatch: The money industry here, regarding the issue of abolishing taels and adopting dollars,</p>
<p>After receiving the order from the ministry, they immediately began preparations and held several meetings. After several deliberations, the measures were submitted to various banks for review.

<h3 id="e80">A Major Fire at the Jinpu Railway Jinan Materials Factory <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Four Road Timber and Warehouse Buildings Destroyed</p>
<p>Losses Estimated at Around 50,000 to 60,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: The Jinan Materials Factory of the Jinpu Railway, attached to the Dahuaishu Factory in the southwest corner, stores the materials used for train operation between Jinan and Hanzhuang. Last night (the 28th) at 8:00 PM, a fire suddenly broke out. At that time, the southwest wind was very strong, and the fire borrowed the power of the wind.</p>
<p>The momentum became greater and greater, and the firelight could be seen in the city. The factory urgently telegraphed the city to alert the authorities. The Public Security Bureau's fire brigade, the Chamber of Commerce's water association, the Japanese fire brigade, the factory, and the Jinpu Railway's fire brigade rushed to put out the fire. It was not until 11:00 PM that the fire was extinguished. The factory is the only large factory on the Jinpu Railway, with great value and important relations. The loss is estimated at about 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. The details of the fire and rescue are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Location of the Fire <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>The materials factory is located in the southwest corner of the factory. In the middle of the factory, there is a pile of discarded road timber, about fifty tons. There is a house northwest of the road timber, containing iron nails. To the west, there is another house containing asbestos. In the iron house to the northeast, there are more than five thousand catties of cotton yarn. In the iron house to the east, there are miscellaneous items such as hemp rope baskets and shoulder poles. The fire initially started on the pile of road timber, and then gradually spread to the surrounding houses due to the strong southwest wind. The fire borrowed the power of the wind, and the wind aided the fire. The firefighters could not get close. The road timber and the above-mentioned four houses were completely destroyed. Although there are no accurate statistics on the losses, they are worth about 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. The material section within the factory is located ten meters away from the fire source, and all the valuable materials are stored there, worth about one million yuan. Further east are the machine factory, iron factory, and the essence of the entire Jinpu Railway, worth tens of millions of yuan. Fortunately, people were sent to protect the surrounding area, and they were not affected.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Rescue Situation <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>When the fire first started, the factory's fire brigade went to the scene with water hoses. The two nearby water pipes were both located on the northeast side of the fire scene. The flames were blown back by the southwest wind, and not only could people not get close, but even water could not be sprayed. Fortunately, four locomotives, No. 13, 16, 38, and 28, were transferred from the station and circled around to the northwest side of the fire scene along the railway to spray water and put out the fire, which began to take effect. On the one hand, people tried their best to carry things out. Hundreds of boxes of gasoline were luckily rescued, otherwise, it would have been unimaginable to add fuel to the fire. It was not until 11:00 PM that the fire was extinguished. At that time, Jinan officials of the Jinpu Railway, such as Engineer Hu Shenghong, Dahuaishu Factory Director Zeng Guangzhi, Qin Wenfan, Materials Factory Director Xu Mingzhi, Jinan Station Director Wang Yuebo, Police Section Chief Liao, and Factory Protection Police Inspector Hu Deyu, all went to the scene to direct the fire fighting. Everyone returned at twelve o'clock, but the factory staff did not rest until four o'clock in the morning. But the embers had not yet completely gone out.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Cause Unknown <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>The cause of the fire has not yet been determined. The factory's one thousand or so workers left work at 5:00 PM and the fire started at 8:00 PM, so it was of course not the workers' fault. However, the coke factory, which is fifty meters southwest of the fire source, burns coke day and night. Every night, the whole place is illuminated like daytime. Moreover, it was a southwest wind that night. It is generally speculated that the embers from the coke factory were blown onto the pile of road timber, causing the fire. The factory has since reported everything to the railway bureau. (April 29th)</p>
<h3 id="e84">Haiyuan Pavilion's Book Collection is Difficult to Sell <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>280,000 Yuan Pledged to a Tianjin Bank Three Years Ago</p>
<p>The Library is Unable to Purchase Due to Excessive Price</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: The Haiyuan Pavilion book collection of the Yang family in Liaocheng, with its rare books and exquisite engravings, is world-renowned. The owner, Yang Jingfu, had several contacts with the Shandong Provincial Library, intending to let the library preserve the books through a method of half donation and half sale. Three years of cold and summer passed, but no agreement was reached. Recently, a guest returning from Tianjin talked to the reporter about the Haiyuan Pavilion book collection, saying that the ownership of the books had long been not Yang's, and the inside story was quite important. The following is a record of this: Three years ago, Yang Jingfu failed in business and first sold several Song and Yuan rare books, obtaining a price of 80,000 yuan. To the best of my knowledge, there are the Shicaitang Hanwen Collection and others. Later, as his business became more and more unsuccessful, he exhausted all his possessions and pledged more than ninety kinds of Song and Yuan rare books to a certain bank in Tianjin, obtaining a price of 280,000 yuan. In total, there were more than ninety kinds of books, with a total of 1,120 volumes, with each volume costing 250 yuan. The amount was huge and shocking. The reason why the bank was willing to pay such a high price at the time was that Zhang Xueliang definitely intended to buy it at a price of 400,000 yuan at the time, so it dared to boldly pledge the books. If Yang Jingfu did not redeem it on time, selling it for 400,000 yuan would still give him a profit of 120,000 yuan. Unexpectedly, as soon as the pledge period passed, the September 18th Incident suddenly broke out. Zhang Xueliang, in his frustration, had no time to care about this idle affair, and the previous agreement was put on hold. At that time, Yang Jingfu repeatedly contacted the Lu Provincial Library, but who knew that the ownership was no longer his? The bank had already passed the pledge period and could of course sell it, but the collection included the four classics and four histories of the Northern Song Dynasty, which are unique in the world, were regarded as something that would</p>
<p>Disgrace them, and the asking price was too high, and no one could afford to buy them. After a long time, they could not be sold, and the accumulated capital reached 280,000 yuan, which greatly affected their business. The shareholders expressed their dissatisfaction. Recently, the bank was forced to reduce the price and sell it, stating that they did not want interest and were willing to sell it as long as they received the original 280,000 yuan. At this time, with the current unstable situation and financial panic, no one was willing to buy this non-urgent item with huge funds. Although selling it to foreigners would get a higher price, the export of cultural relics would also violate the regulations. Therefore, as of recently, there is still no solution. The Beiping Library and the Shandong Library both intend to purchase the books, but such a huge amount of money cannot be handled at once, and their efforts are to no avail. According to Haiyuan Pavilion, a famous book collector in China, Wang Xiantang, the director of the Lu Provincial Library, wrote "The Past and Present of the Haiyuan Pavilion Book Collection," which records its origins in detail. Among them, there are more than 500 kinds of rare books from the Song and Yuan dynasties. In recent years, half of them have been destroyed by war and bandits, and the owner of the books, Yang Jingfu, has sold them repeatedly. Only these ninety kinds remain. It is also regrettable that Yang did not keep them. (April 29th)</p>

<p>Robbers Successively Rob Two Families</p>
<p>In the county's sixteenth district (Wan'an City), ninety-third ward, Nan Liu Alley, villager Liu Er, a farmer by trade and of modest means, was targeted by over ten robbers wielding pistols late the other night around midnight. They scaled the wall and entered his home, dragging Liu Er from his bed, stripping him of his clothes, and tying him up. They poured cold water into his ears, eyes, nose, and mouth, causing him to nearly die three times. They also confined his daughter-in-law, Ms. Mou, in a room, demanding she reveal the location of hidden silver. They ransacked drawers and chests, stealing sixty-three silver dollars, two leather jackets, and cloth-padded clothing, totaling over two hundred yuan in losses. After obtaining their loot, the robbers headed towards Sima Dun. Not satisfied, they broke into the home of Miao Quanquan, a farmer renting land, in the Sima Dun area. They stole two gold rings and a pair of gold bracelets.</p>

<p>Bandits in Yangjia Temple Resist Arrest</p>
<p>Bandits have recently been discovered in the Yangjia Temple Cangjie Mountain area bordering the county's 90th and 10th districts. Upon receiving this information, the 10th District Security Corps, led by District Commander Lu, launched a search at 5:00 AM yesterday (the 29th) with over twenty soldiers. Unexpectedly, the bandits resisted arrest. The Security Corps captured a suspect named Jiang Depeng and immediately sent him to the city for detention. A report was also sent to Magistrate Ma, who also served as the county's head of the police, Zhu Xinke to lead dozens of detectives to search. The bandits then opened fire, killing Zhuang Yishan, a patrol officer, with a bullet to the head. Upon receiving this news, Magistrate Ma immediately instructed Chen Xuntao, the Director of the Public Security Bureau, to select capable officers to assist in the suppression. The operation resulted in the death of two bandits and the recovery of two Mauser rifles. In addition, bandit activity has been rampant in the 3rd District. Huang Jinting, the director of the responsible Public Security Bureau, came to the city today (the 29th) to request troops for suppression.</p>

<p>Pirates Planning to Rob Dinghai Ship Arrested</p>
<p>Shenjiamen, Dinghai County, is home to the First Patrol Team of the Offshore Water Police Bureau. Shen Ligul, a detective from Taizhou assigned to the team, visited the prostitute A Hong in Lotus Bay on the evening of the 27th around 10:00 PM. There, he encountered five gangsters, including his fellow villager, Chen Liansi. They spoke freely of their shared hometown, unaware that Shen was a detective. Chen and his accomplices confessed that a Dinghai ship would be sailing from Shen to Yong tomorrow, carrying 40,000 yuan in banknotes from the Industrial Bank of China. They had gathered over thirty people, armed with guns, to rob the ship after it set sail. Upon hearing this, Shen remained calm and excused himself. He reported the situation to his team leader, who immediately dispatched a large team of water police to surround the brothel. They arrested Chen and his four accomplices, seizing five Mauser pistols loaded with ammunition. Under interrogation, they confessed to having a pirate ship anchored in the river, with the rest of the gang on board. Team leader Yuan Ti led another team to seize the pirate ship, where they apprehended twelve more gang members, including Xu Laoliu. During questioning, they learned that eight other gang members were still at large and are currently being pursued. The arrested pirates were transferred to the Water Police Bureau for further investigation today.</p>

<p>Message to Workers</p>
<p>The City General Labor Union issued a message to all workers in the city for the May 1st commemoration, stating: "Dearest workers of the city, today is the great and enthusiastic International Labor Day, celebrating the victory of European and American workers over capitalists. On May 1, 1886, tens of thousands of workers in Chicago, USA, held a tragic and grand demonstration demanding an eight-hour workday, eight hours of rest, and eight hours of education, breaking away from the previous abuse of endless labor. This movement eventually achieved victory, and workers in various parts of Europe and America made similar demands on this day, achieving similar victories, and designated May 1st as International Labor Day every year. This is something that we should all celebrate. Today, as we commemorate Labor Day amidst the serious national crisis, and the precarious situation, and celebrate the victory of workers in various countries of the world, we must recognize the following: (1) The reason why European and American workers were able to achieve the eight-hour system is because they had a conscious will and united solidarity. The grand demonstration on May 1, 1886, was an expression of their spirit of sacrifice and struggle. Although they were under the oppression of the military force of capitalist politics at that time, they resolutely carried out this enthusiastic and great movement, finally shattering the dreams of the capitalists and achieving final victory. Therefore, when we commemorate May 1st, we should emulate the fearless spirit of struggle of European and American workers, unite and break the aggression of international capitalism, resist the unreasonable oppression of domestic capitalists, and strive for a human life. (2) China is a country with backward production. Various industries and commerce cannot compete with foreign countries. Recently, due to the fierce competition from foreign goods, domestic products have been severely hit. For example, the recent reduction in working hours by Chinese-owned yarn factories due to sluggish sales is affected by the dumping of Japanese yarn. If this continues, Chinese industry will be on the verge of bankruptcy, and the livelihoods of our workers will inevitably be desperate. Therefore, under this situation, we must emulate the hardworking and dedicated spirit of European and American workers, improve production, improve skills, reduce the cost of production, and improve the quality to compete with foreign goods, save the endangered Chinese industry, and achieve our own true benefits. (3) Since September 18th, the lost territories in the Northeast have not been recovered, and Yu and Re have successively fallen. Recently, Tianjin and Beijing are in danger, and North China is shaken. The tragedy of national subjugation is imminent. Workers in the entire city should share the difficulties of the times, strive for sincere cooperation between labor and capital, eliminate all disputes between labor and capital, intensify the work of resisting Japan, and vigorously promote the boycott of Japanese goods, jointly saving this serious national crisis. Otherwise, if the country is destroyed and our families are broken, what benefits can we get? What eight-hour system can we demand? The above three points are what the Union wants to tell all workers in the city on this May 1st commemoration. We hope that our dearest workers will work hard and move forward, break through all the current difficulties, and achieve our final victory.</p>

<p>Presenting Credentials Tomorrow Morning</p>
<p>Consulate in Shanghai to be Restored Soon</p>
<p>Soviet Ambassador to China, Bogomoletz, has decided to visit Chairman Lin of the National Government tomorrow morning to present his credentials. A reporter from the New News Agency went to the Russian Embassy office on Xinzha Road yesterday to inquire about the date of Bogomoletz's departure from Shanghai to the capital. The reporter was received by the Chinese Counselor, Oshanin, who stated the following:</p>
<h3 id="e91">Departing for Capital This Morning <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Oshanin said, "The date for the presentation of credentials has been confirmed. Ambassador Bogomoletz, along with his wife, my wife and I, Counselor Bykov, Deputy Consul-General Milikiewicz stationed in Shanghai, and Chief Secretary of the Embassy, Kesin, a total of seven people, will take the 9:25 AM express train from Shanghai to Beijing this morning (the 1st). At 10:00 AM the next morning, they will visit Chairman Lin of the National Government to present their credentials."</p>
<h3 id="e92">Permanently Stationed in Capital <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>The Ambassador has decided to be permanently stationed in the capital to discuss all diplomatic issues between China and Russia. However, whether he will stay in Beijing after presenting his credentials or return to Shanghai will depend on the situation after arriving in Beijing. The Embassy will be located in Nanjing, but the address has not yet been determined. The office here is temporary and will be closed soon. After arriving in Beijing, they will temporarily reside at the Yangtze River Hotel.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Consulate to be Restored <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the former Soviet Consulate on Huangpu Road near the Waibaidu Bridge in Shanghai, the consulate will be restored. Anguski, the director of the embassy and consul general stationed in Beijing, is planning and is very experienced, and has been assigned to stay in Shanghai to handle this matter.</p>
<h3 id="e94">New Consul General to Arrive <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>The new Consul General to Shanghai has not yet been announced. Before the new Consul General arrives in Shanghai, Deputy Consul Milikiewicz will temporarily act as the Consul General. The new Consul General and consuls in Tianjin and other places will be formally decided after Ambassador Bogomoletz presents his credentials. They will then come to China from Vladivostok with their secretaries to take office.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Treaty Issues <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Regarding your (addressing the reporter) inquiry about China and Russia negotiating a treaty of friendship and a non-aggression treaty, according to international practice, no political or commercial issues should be discussed before the presentation of credentials. Therefore, I am not in a position to comment. After Ambassador Bogomoletz visits Chairman Lin and presents his credentials, if there are any such issues, I will do my best to release information.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Special Railway Car Prepared <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>

<p>[P Chu Minyi's Remarks</p>
<p>Meaning of Convening the Rural Reconstruction Committee</p>
<p>Relief for Silk Industry to be Discussed in Executive Yuan</p>
<p>Chu Minyi, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, arrived in Shanghai from the capital the day before yesterday morning. Yesterday morning, he met with reporters at his residence to discuss relief for the silk industry and rural reconstruction. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Relief for Silk Industry: Chu said that the Chinese yarn industry is suffering from the dumping of foreign goods, resulting in poor business and overproduction. The industry has jointly proposed three suggestions to the government to fundamentally solve the problem. Premier Wang received and accepted the suggestions and decided to hand them over to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry for review. The Civil Movement Committee of the Central Party Headquarters also sent representatives to participate in the discussions. These discussions will be held in Beijing today and will be submitted to the Executive Yuan meeting next Tuesday for discussion. The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry will also review and propose methods to relieve the decline of the silk industry.</p>
<p>Rural Reconstruction: Regarding rural reconstruction, the Executive Yuan has hired economists from across the country to form a Rural Reconstruction Committee. The first meeting will be convened in Beijing on May 5th. Chu said that he came to Shanghai this time to host a banquet at the Bank Club on the night before last on behalf of Premier Wang, inviting the members in Shanghai, reporting the meaning of the committee's organization, and exchanging opinions. Premier Wang will be the chairman of the committee, which will conduct specialized research and propose plans to be implemented by the Executive Yuan.</p>
<p>Reorganization of Provincial Government: Shao Liz, Chairman of the Gansu Provincial Government, returned to the capital from Gansu and immediately requested resignation from the central government. At that time, the government had intended to swap him with Yang Hucheng, Chairman of Shaanxi Province, but this has not been decided yet. As for the reorganization of Jiangsu Province, it will be succeeded by Liu Zhenhua, and it is rumored that Zhou Fohai and He Yushu will succeed the heads of the civil and construction affairs departments. Chu said that he did not hear of this when he left Beijing, or it may be speculation from various parties.</p>
<p>Wang's Recovery: Premier Wang suffered from carbuncle, and his condition is good after being treated by doctors during his previous visit to Shanghai. The wound is gradually healing, but it is very slow. Chu himself is scheduled to return to Beijing last night.</p>

<h3 id="e98">National Goods Groups Oppose Municipal Council's Factory Inspection <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Petition Submitted to the Municipal Government Yesterday Requesting Negotiations Based on Reason</p>
<p>All National Goods Factories Vow to be the Backbone</p>
<p>The Chinese National Goods Maintenance Association and the Shanghai Citizens' National Goods Promotion Association submitted a petition to the Municipal Government yesterday, protesting the Municipal Council's seizure of the right to inspect factories. The original text is as follows: "Petition regarding the Public Concession Municipal Council seizing the right to inspect factories, destroying the production of national goods, requesting strict negotiations based on reason to protect national rights. Factory inspection is an important task for social production, and the Factory Inspection Law is the entire law of our country. Now, the Public Concession Municipal Council, based on the tax amount of a minority of taxpayers and the resolution of the Westerners' meeting, has revised the annex to the Yangjingbang Regulations, seizing the right to inspect factories and issue factory licenses. If implemented, it will not only infringe on sovereignty and violate laws, but also restrict the freedom of Chinese citizens to operate businesses and limit the establishment of factories, destroying the production of national goods and implementing a new economic aggression policy. The cunningness of their methods and the malice of their intentions are unbearable. This matter concerns the interests of the national goods industry and is of great importance. As groups of national goods factories responsible for protecting interests, we issued a serious declaration in the newspapers yesterday, resolutely opposing it, in order to awaken the attention of citizens. We also convened a factory representative meeting a few days ago and unanimously expressed opposition, vowing to be the government's backbone. It was resolved on the spot to (1) petition the Municipal Government to negotiate strictly and protect national rights; (2) send letters to national goods groups to send personnel to organize a committee against the Municipal Council's seizure of the right to inspect factories, concentrating the strength of the protest. In addition to sending letters to the groups to organize regular meetings, we hereby submit a petition to the Municipal Government for serious negotiations and arguments based on reason in order to protect national rights and benefit national goods. Our association leads all national goods factories and vows to be a strong backbone. We anxiously await your orders."</p>
<h3 id="e99">Central Government's Policy for Dealing with New Changes <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>To Continue Sending Special Envoys to Assist Huang Xuanwei</p>
<p>Qian Tong Cables Executive Yuan Offering Suggestions</p>
<p>Regarding the turmoil in Xinjiang, the Central Government has appointed Huang Musong to go there to express condolences and investigate the truth in order to completely resolve the dispute. According to Chu Minyi, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, speaking to a reporter from the Central News Agency, Huang Xuanwei is now in Jiangxi to pay his respects to Chairman Chiang and ask for specific guidelines for handling the new changes. He will still return to Beijing within a few days and then go to Xinjiang. The Central Party Headquarters, the Executive Yuan, and the Military Affairs Commission will all select special envoys to accompany him to Xinjiang to assist with everything. As for the method of handling the new changes, Qian Tong (Zi Mengcai), who once held an important position in Xinjiang Province, is extremely familiar with the situation in Xinjiang. Qian is currently staying in Peiping and cabled the central government a few days ago, offering his opinions on how to handle the turmoil in Xinjiang. The content is roughly as follows: The Muslim rebellion in Xinjiang has lasted for two years. The cause of this is that Jin De'an indulged his fellow villagers in Hezhou and confiscated the land of the Hami Muslims, and placed the Mongolian princes under house arrest in the province, not allowing them to return to their banners, and even killing them, which incited a great chaos that was difficult to clean up. The central government is currently out of reach and unable to respond, but we must think of a way to remedy the situation. It is easy to talk about securing the area but those sent must be soldiers. How can they achieve their goals in a few months? It is suggested that the Executive Yuan first cable Ma Shaowu, the head of Kashi Gar administrative office (Shie Ying), to find a way to appease the situation. If the southern route is stable, the new situation will be easier to maintain. On the other hand, we should start using Han people who have registered in Xinjiang, such as Li Rong, the president of Dihua Administration Court, and Li Zhonglin, the former head of Tacheng. Zhonglin is proficient in Russian, Mongolian, Kazakh and other languages, and is a useful talent in the northwest. Jin De'an was suspicious and did not use them. The central government should recruit them quickly. On the other hand, a special envoy should be sent to Xinjiang in the shortest possible time to implement military and civilian separation. The overall situation in the northwest can then be saved.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Shanghai Municipal Farmers' Association Inauguration <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Farmers' Association, in preparation since November of the 20th year, has been delayed until now due to various factors. It was finally approved by the Municipal Party Headquarters to hold its inaugural meeting yesterday morning at 9:00 AM on the third floor of the Municipal Party Headquarters. The Municipal Party Headquarters sent Zhou Lianze to attend and provide guidance, and the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau sent Wu Huanru to attend and provide guidance. Guests included Huang Zhizhi (Municipal Assembly), Sun Daosheng (Journalists' Association), Wu Shuxing (Social Affairs Bureau), and over a hundred people, including all preparatory committee members and representatives from various districts. After the ceremony, discussions on proposals began, and the association's charter was approved. Officers and councilors were elected, and the meeting adjourned at 1:00 PM. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Meeting Order (1) Ring bell to begin the meeting, (2) Elect the chairman of the presidium, (3) All stand at attention, (4) Sing the Party song, (5) Pay the highest respects to the national flag, Party flag, and portrait of the late Premier, (6) The Chairman respectfully reads the late Premier's will, (7) Silent mourning, (8) Chairman's report, (9) Representative of the preparatory committee reports on the preparations, (10) Representatives of Party and government organs provide guidance, (11) Speeches by guests, (12) Approval of the charter, (13) Discussion of proposals, (14) Provisional motions, (15) Elections, (16) Shout slogans, (17) Photograph, (18) Adjournment.</p>
<p>District Representatives Aside from Zhabei District, they are: Pengpu District: Hou Shizhang, Wang Tongfu, Hou Junren; Yinhang District: Zhu Wenxiang, Sun Huazhong; Hunan District: Shen Ruoxu, Zhang Huijun; Fahua District: Liu Rong, Gu Siqing; Jiangwan District: Liu Daokui, Wu Ziju; Yangsi District: Hu Zhusan, Ma Jinpo; Yinxiang District: Lu Jingtan, Yang Xinshi; Gaohang District: Yu Zhenhui, Zhu Runsheng; Caohjing District: Wu Rugui, Zong Xiaojie.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report The presidium of the association was recommended by the preparatory committee to be chaired by Yu Zhenhui and Liu Daokui. Zhang Sheng was also added as chairman by the general meeting. Yu Zhenhui first reported, roughly saying that although this city is a prosperous metropolis, agricultural land still accounts for the largest proportion of the city's land, and farmers still account for the largest proportion of the city's population. While industry, commerce, and education all have organizations, farmers' organizations should be formed as soon as possible. This association could have been established earlier since preparations began two years ago, but it was interrupted by the January 28th Incident. Now, farmers' associations in various districts and representatives from various districts have been gradually elected, and today the inaugural meeting is officially held. In the future, we must make extra efforts to seek the welfare of all farmers in the city.</p>
<p>Preparatory Committee Report The preparatory committee recommended Zhang Huice to report, roughly saying that the Shanghai Municipal Farmers' Association has been in preparation for a year and a half, and it is only now that it has been announced that it has been established. Its responsibility to the preparatory committee can be said to have been fulfilled. However, the reasons why it could not be established earlier should be explained. After the association recommended Yu Zhenhui, Liu Daokui, and 13 others as preparatory committee members in November of the 20th year, it immediately began preparatory work. Before long, the January 28th Incident occurred, and the association's preparatory work was interrupted. Since the armistice, work could have been continued intermittently, but in April of that year, the central government issued a nationwide order that people's organizations that had not yet been organized should postpone their establishment. Therefore, the association also stagnated invisibly. It was not until November of the same year that it began to actively proceed. Currently, only one district, Zhabei, has not elected representatives to attend. The preparatory committee has presented it to the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau, and they have chosen today to hold the inaugural meeting. As for economic and other reports, please refer to the association's inaugural special issue.</p>
<p>Speeches by Representatives Zhou Lianze, representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters, gave a speech, roughly saying that the Party attaches great importance to the farmers' movement. This can be confirmed in the farmers' movement proposal of the Second National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang. Farmers account for more than 85% of the national population, and agricultural products account for more than 90% of the national output. From these statistics, we can clearly understand the importance of the position of farmers in China. The late Premier once said, "If the farmers' movement is done well, then the national revolution will achieve a great success." However, looking at the tragic state of bankruptcy of the rural economy in China today, we cannot but attach importance to the farmers' movement. The reasons for the bankruptcy of the rural economy can be observed from both internal and external aspects. External reasons include the economic and political aggression of imperialism. Internal reasons include exorbitant taxes, and the exploitation of farmers by landlords, vagrants, local tyrants, and corrupt gentry, so that farmers cannot live in peace in the countryside and have to leave the countryside and go to the city. Therefore, if we want to seek the welfare of farmers, we must overthrow these two internal and external reactionary forces. After the representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters finished his speech, Wu Hengru, chief of the Second Section of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, gave a speech, roughly saying that the bankruptcy of China's rural economy today is undeniable. There are many reasons for its bankruptcy, but the most important reason is the low price of agricultural products. Taking China's main agricultural products, such as rice and cotton, as an example, the price of rice is now less than 10 yuan per dan, and the price of cotton is only about 12 yuan per dan. Due to the low price of agricultural products, farmers' income can hardly maintain their lives. Therefore, farmers have to leave the countryside and go to the city to make a living. Therefore, from the standpoint of farmers, we still hope that the price of agricultural products will rise. This view will be opposed by industry and commerce, whose reason is that if the price of domestic agricultural products rises, the market will be rejected by cheap imported goods. However, we observe that the methods used in rural China today are still very old. Therefore, we should apply scientific methods, which can increase production while reducing production costs. This is also a way to remedy the rural economy. Therefore, what I hope for in the future Municipal Farmers' Association is not to add the name of a municipal farmers' association to a certain telegram, but to use a scientific spirit to strive to improve production methods in order to seek the actual happiness of farmers. In addition, there were speeches by Sun Daosheng, representative of the Journalists' Association, and others, which were mostly encouraging and are omitted here.</p>
<p>Approval of Proposals After the representatives finished their speeches, they began to discuss the plan to improve the countryside: A.

<p>General Meeting Telegram The association issued a telegram in the name of the general meeting: (1) To comfort the anti-Japanese soldiers, etc.: To all the newspapers across the country, forward to the front-line soldiers for your review. You are resisting with blood and repeatedly defeating strong enemies, fighting for the status of our nation, fighting for the national character of our country, and fighting for the justice of the world's powers. Your sacrifice is just and your righteousness is as thin as the sky. On behalf of all the farmers in the city, the enemy association first expresses its condolences. (2) Please Comrade Hu Hanmin to enter Beijing to jointly face the national crisis, etc.: To all the newspapers across the country, forward to Comrade Hu Hanmin in Hong Kong for your review. The violent Japanese invaded the East Province, taking an inch and wanting a foot. The country is in danger, and it is not enough to concentrate the national strength to save it. Comrade has been loyal to the Party and the country, and his words and deeds are cautious and rigorous. He has long been admired by the whole country. He should be invited to enter Beijing immediately to jointly face the national crisis.</p>

<p>Xu Shiying, representative of the Shanghai Charity Organizations Joint Relief Association for Northeast Refugees, said, "Listeners, elders, brothers, sisters, today,</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>Our country's national crisis has reached this point, and it is truly a matter of life and death for the entire Chinese nation. Looking at the war zones in the Northeast and along the Great Wall, tens of millions of innocent compatriots are suffering from the bombing of enemy planes and artillery, and the casualties and displacement are simply a living hell. Brothers are in trouble, and we should crawl to save them. Colleagues, without measuring our abilities, jointly formed this association in August last year with the Chinese Red Cross Society, the China Foreign Relief Association, the World Red Swastika Society, the Chinese Jisheng Society, the Xinwei Relief Society, the Lianyi Charity Association, the Huisheng Charity Society, the Pushan Villa, and the Chinese Moral Society, nine charitable organizations in the city, and called for relief, hoping to fulfill the responsibilities of a citizen. We are grateful to the Shanghai Chinese Commercial Radio Station and the staff of each radio station, as well as the famous speakers, musicians, singers, Peking opera stars, Kunqu opera, storytelling, Shanghai opera, etc., who enthusiastically solicited donations and broadcast together. Listeners from all walks of life in Shanghai tightened their belts and actively donated. We are also grateful to the Guohua Bank and its staff for collecting donations at a low rate. This kind of united, unanimous determination to save the country is enough to show the spirit of our nation, making those who love us happy and those who hate us tremble. Moreover, benevolent soup and righteous grain, accumulated little by little, directly relieve the compatriots in distress, and indirectly save the country. As the saying goes, the people are the foundation of the country, and when the foundation is strong, the country is stable. The association admires the kindness of all walks of life and will first summarize the donations and remit them to Mr. Dong Qu Wenliu and Mr. Feng Yangshan, resident in Pingchang, who will, together with the Deputy Chairman Xiong Xiling, resident in Ping, and entrust Mr. Qi Erdun, the British General Manager of the Qinhuangdao Kailuan Mining Bureau and the Chief Director of the Association, to preside over the relief affairs. We vow to use all the donations, without wasting a penny, on the relief cause. Today, I am publicly pushing Shiying to express my gratitude to you with 120,000 points of sincerity. However, now that the war is not over, the compatriots in distress cannot sleep peacefully for a day, and the mission undertaken by the association cannot be relieved for a day. Regarding all aspects of fundraising and relief, please, listeners, express your opinions and guide us at any time, and ask for tireless goodness and continued donations to save the people and the country. I am extremely grateful. A brief report is attached below: (1) Listeners' donations, from February 16 to the 28th of this month, totaled 72,355.39 yuan; (2) The association has allocated and remitted about 330,000 yuan to the Northeast for relief, excluding clothing and other supplies; (3) The association's work location and process: (A) Last year, Standing Director Feng Yangshan went to the Northeast to relieve the flood in Harbin and other places; (B) Last year, Standing Director Qu Wenliu personally went to Kailu, Chaoyang, Qinhuangdao, and other places to relieve the war-torn compatriots; (C) Set up five porridge distribution factories in Beijing City and Township to relieve the Northeast refugees fleeing to Ping; (D) Relieved the families of General Li Du's subordinates who fled back from Russia; (E) Relieved the families of Commander-in-Chief Wang Delin's subordinates who fled back from Russia in Shanghai; (F) Borrowed all the mining area houses of the Kailuan Mining Bureau in Qinhuangdao to set up a refugee shelter; (G) Recently, according to repeated telegram reports from the two Standing Directors Qu and Feng, the relief work locations are the rear of the battlefield of Gubeikou, Xifengkou, Luowenyu, Lengkou, etc., and Zunhua, Kaiping, Luanxian, Miyun, and other places.</p>

<h3 id="e105">Liang Shiyi's Memorial Service Held Yesterday Morning <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Hundreds of Dignitaries from All Walks of Life Attended to Pay Tribute</p>
<p>Fundraising for Memorial Items and Scholarship Fund</p>
<p>Liang Shiyi, former Prime Minister, lived in his ancestral home in Guangdong for a long time. He quietly came to Shanghai a month ago and suddenly passed away on the 9th of last month at his residence on Haig Road. Yesterday was the day to receive the posts. Many relatives and friends of Liang Shiyi's lifetime went to pay tribute. Liang's relatives and friends also initiated a fundraising memorial fund to help fund scholarships, and half of the funds have now been collected. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Simple Funeral After Liang Shiyi passed away, the coffin was held the next day in accordance with his last wishes. No music was used, no yin-yang masters were used, and there were no underworld instruments or paper crafts, and all things similar to superstition and vanity. Yesterday, the memorial service was held to receive posts. Outside Liang's residence, there was a large shed, with couplets from all walks of life hanging on the four walls. The memorial hall was arranged in the east wing of the house. A sacrificial table was set in the middle, with a censer, several bottles of flowers, and wreaths from relatives and friends. All underworld instruments, sacrificial utensils, and all vulgar customs were eliminated, creating a rather sad and solemn atmosphere.</p>
<p>Tributes from All Walks of Life Yesterday morning, many well-known figures, officials, businessmen from all countries in Shanghai went to pay tribute, including Wu Chaochu, Ye Gongchuo, Mu Ouchu, Qian Xinzhi, Xu Jilun, Li Fuxun, Lin Kanghou, Huang Yanpei, Hu Mengjia, Liu Peiquan, Xu Xinliu, Chen Guangfu, Lu Jianquan, Yang Dunfu, Qu Yingguang, Zhou Zuomin, Wu Yunzhai, Fang Jiaobo, Wang Youling, Wang Binyan, etc. Yesterday was also the day of the public memorial service of the Railway Association. From morning to noon, more than hundreds of people went to pay their respects. Pingjin Bank and all walks of life in transportation also scheduled to hold a memorial service yesterday.</p>
<p>Eulogies from Relatives and Friends Many eulogies were sent from all walks of life. Chiang Kai-shek's memorial text is omitted here because it is too long.</p>
<p>Fundraising for Scholarships Liang's relatives and friends initiated a memorial fund to raise 100,000 yuan first. Currently, there are 33,000 yuan in public bonds, and the number of relatives and friends who have determined the amount and paid cash is about 50,000 yuan. Those who have recognized but not determined the amount are not included. It is said that its use is to edit Liang's Complete Works and subsidize young, poor college students. Each student will receive 500 yuan per year, six in the first year, twelve in the second year, eighteen in the third year, and so on, increasing to forty-two college students in the ninth year. By 1947, the number of students can be expanded to 100. Such a planned scholarship fund is truly worthy of imitation by the Chinese people.</p>

<p>The Huang Mother Zhu Tai Furen, who enjoyed a longevity of 93 years, is the respected mother of Mr. Huang Qinglan. Yesterday, she received posts at home.

<h3 id="e107">Meeting Record of China Colonization Society <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>The China Colonization Society held a banquet at the Western Restaurant of the Sichuan Road YMCA from 12:00 PM to 2:00 PM yesterday to open a membership recruitment meeting. Thirty to forty old members attended. The meeting was as follows: Chairman Wang Yang reported on the purpose of the meeting. Zhou Nianxian, director of the staff member section, asked each captain to pay attention to the procedures to be handled. Mr. Zhen Jingqing gave a speech on the desolate situation in the Northwest, roughly saying that when he went to the Northwest in 1927, he saw that the local people were more willing to serve in the South, which shows the painful situation in the Northwest. Therefore, when he returned to Shanghai, he had the organization of the Northwest Reclamation Group. However, after investigation, he knew that there were many difficulties, such as inconvenient transportation. Therefore, he said that if we do not pay attention to the Northwest again, I am afraid that the Northwest will follow the Northeast and be lost, and we will regret it too late. Today, I declare to you that I am willing to do my best and work hard with all of you comrades to the end. Mr. Kang Wenzhi gave a speech, roughly saying that the word "colonization" originally meant enduring hardships and seeking happiness for the public, not seeking happiness in the border areas.

<h3 id="e108">Shanghai Automated Telephone Rate Increase to Take Effect Today <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Old Rates to Apply to Longhua and Other Areas Without Automated Service</p>
<p>Business Phone Rates to Increase from Six to Ten Yuan</p>
<p>The Shanghai Telephone Bureau under the Ministry of Transportation, after retrofitting to automated telephone service, has decided to increase the rental fees for automatic telephone lines starting May 1st. Although various industry associations jointly opposed the increase, the Telephone Bureau, citing rising gold prices and insufficient revenue to cover expenses, is determined to implement the increase as scheduled. Detailed information is provided below:</p>
<p>▲Notice to the Public The Telephone Bureau's notice states: "To whom it may concern, our bureau's automatic telephone system has begun operation. The equipment was ordered by the Ministry of Transportation from the United States at a total cost of over US$570,000, equivalent to approximately 2,800,000 Chinese yuan. According to the contract, the Bureau must repay US$4,000 per month, equivalent to approximately 20,000 Chinese yuan, from the date of operation. Furthermore, to facilitate rapid and convenient communication for users in the Nanshi and Zhabei districts, we initially intended to lease an additional 100 pairs of trunk lines from the Shanghai Telephone Company. The original annual rental fee for these lines was 50 taels, but the company's newly revised price list sets the annual rental fee at 200 taels per line, a fourfold increase. After repeated negotiations, we were unable to reach an agreement and could only lease 30 pairs. In addition, long-distance and Chinese-administered area calls still require operator assistance, and the costs of materials and parts continue to rise. With the current surge in gold prices and the high cost of living, our existing revenue only covers half of our expenses, resulting in a significant deficit. The Ministry of Transportation, recognizing this situation, has ordered a price increase to help alleviate the financial burden. However, given the economic hardship in Shanghai since the January 28th Incident, we have reduced the proposed prices compared to other areas with automated telephone systems to ease the burden on the public. We will also maintain the old rates for areas without automated service, such as Longhua, Jiangwan, and Zhenru, to further alleviate the burden on citizens. Our difficulties are truly unavoidable. We believe that users and the Bureau have a close relationship, and mutual understanding and cooperation are essential for effective communication. We sincerely hope for your understanding and support. Respectfully, we wish you all the best."</p>
<p>▲Reply to the Chamber of Commerce The Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation sent a letter to the Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating: "In response to your letter regarding the Shanghai Restaurant and Catering Industry Association's request to cancel the telephone rate increase, we are writing to provide an explanation. As a state-owned enterprise, we always consider both business development and the financial burden on users. However, the renovation to an automatic telephone system has incurred enormous capital expenditures. We must repay a substantial sum of 20,000 yuan per month, and our total revenues only cover half of our expenses. The deficit is substantial. Following the Ministry's directive, we will slightly increase the rental fees starting May 1st to help alleviate the financial burden. This is an unavoidable measure. Given the economic downturn in Shanghai since the January 28th Incident, the Ministry has adjusted the proposed prices to be lower than the business rates for automatic telephone systems in other areas. Furthermore, areas such as Jiangwan, Zhenru, and Longhua, which will be equipped with automatic systems in the future, will continue to be charged according to the old rates, reflecting our consideration for the public's situation. Therefore, we regret to inform you that we cannot comply with the Restaurant and Catering Industry Association's request to cancel the rate increase. We hope you will understand and inform the association accordingly."</p>

<p>| Replacements Drawn from Patrol Police |</p>
<p>When the Jiangsu-Shanghai Second Special District Court was established, it was originally planned to have 16 bailiffs and 4 police chiefs. The General Patrol Bureau was to select capable detectives from various police stations and recommend them for recruitment. Detectives would serve as police chiefs, and Chinese police officers would serve as bailiffs. Later, due to insufficient personnel for dispatch, four additional officers were added, bringing the total to twenty. Recently, due to the large number of criminal cases, the existing number of police officers was still insufficient for deployment. Therefore, the president of the court consulted with the police superintendent of the French Concession and selected six Chinese police officers, numbers 271, 515, 529, 559, 641, and 657, from various police stations to transfer to the court to serve as bailiffs. There are now a total of twenty-six bailiffs, which is sufficient for dispatch, court duty, summoning defendants, and providing bail.</p>

<p>Chief of Flight Crew, Schmid, Dies</p>
<p>General Manager Li Jingcong Discusses the Incident Yesterday</p>
<p>The Euro-Asia Airlines long-distance test flight crashed in Germany, the fuselage was completely burned, and the chief of the flight crew, the German Mr. Schmid, died. A detailed account of the incident was obtained from the company's General Manager, Li Jingcong, and is recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Test Flight Details <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Our company newly purchased several aircraft in Germany, originally intending to fly them to Shanghai via Russia and Tacheng on the Sino-Russian border at the end of this month (April). However, due to the Xinjiang Incident, this plan had to be postponed to May 8th. Furthermore, since much of the route from Russia to China passes through high mountains and steep ridges, a long-distance test flight was necessary beforehand. Therefore, Mr. Schmid, the chief of the flight crew of our company, was dispatched to conduct a long-distance test flight, including flying over the 3,500-foot-high Alb Mountains, on one of the new aircraft on the afternoon of the day before yesterday (April 29th). Unfortunately, the accident occurred at this time, the fuselage was completely burned, and Mr. Schmid died in the line of duty. The loss of a talent with a historical relationship with our country and Euro-Asia Airlines is deeply regrettable. The details of the cause of the accident have not yet been reported in detail.</p>
<h3 id="e124">History in China <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Li continued, "Mr. Schmid came to China in 1927 as a representative of the German Lufthansa, and I (Li referred to himself) negotiated the opening of an aviation business between Europe and Asia in a private capacity. Until the establishment of the National Government, I served as the head of the Aviation Section of the Ministry of Transportation, in charge of aviation matters. Mr. Schmid seized this opportunity to negotiate with me on the Sino-German Euro-Asia Aviation Postal Contract. At that time, there were quite fierce disputes between the two sides regarding rights and interests. Mr. Schmid knew very well that in cooperating with the new China, he could no longer handle this matter from the perspective of previously signed railway cooperation contracts. Finally, with Mr. Schmid's efforts, he was able to adhere to the principle of equality and mutual benefit in all aspects, and the contract was signed in 1929. In 1930, Euro-Asia Airlines (that is, our company) was established, and Mr. Schmid was appointed as the chief of the flight crew. Since the establishment of the company, he has always been involved in every test flight, no matter how difficult or dangerous, just like the test flight on the Shanghai-Manchuria route in the spring of the same year, the test flight on the Shanghai-Xinjiang (via Ruoshui River) route in the winter of 1931, and the test flight on the Shaanxi-Gansu line last spring. The opening of air traffic was also deeply dependent on Mr. Schmid's assistance and planning. I remember that last June, when I left the company, Mr. Schmid made a test flight on the Shanghai-Xinjiang line to Gansu and Xinjiang. He once told me beforehand that all the previous joint test flights had been successful, and this time he felt that there was a sign of difficulty in succeeding on his own. As a result, both test flights failed. In December, I returned to the company as general manager, and it was finally successful. The fate between Mr. Schmid and me is also considered strange. In January of this year, our company, in order to carry out the Euro-Asia inter-air traffic plan, purchased many aircraft in Germany, and specially sent Mr. Schmid back to Germany to preside over the test flight from Germany to China. Mr. Schmid said to me before leaving that he hoped to fly back from Europe together at that time, which would be smoother. Due to official affairs, I was unable to go, and Mr. Schmid sacrificed himself in Germany for long-distance adventurous test flights to promote Chinese aviation and the world aviation business of the Euro-Asia line. No matter what his relationship with me and the future of Chinese aviation, Mr. Schmid's death is a great loss to the aviation industry."</p>

<p>"I originally planned to fly from Shanghai to Hankou and then to Guangdong the day after tomorrow (3rd) for a test flight on the Guangdong-Hankou line. Now, because Mr. Schmid died in an accident, I have to prepare a memorial service to mark his memory and reschedule it for the 4th. Mr. Schmid's wife is now in Peiping, and I have telegraphed the German Minister to China to notify her. As for Mr. Schmid's bereavement compensation and other aftermath matters, it will be necessary to wait for the Ministry of Transportation to decide on the handling."</p>

<p>Extremely Harsh to the Judge</p>
<p>Fiercely Glaring at the Clerk</p>
<p>Zhang Xiulan, also known as Huang Li, a 29-year-old woman from Changsha, Hunan Province, residing at No. 9, Lane 729, Avenue Road in the French Concession, held an important position in the Communist Party and was secretly working in Shanghai. Her clerk, a certain Mr. Jia, was recently arrested by the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau with the assistance of the patrol police in the Public Concession and sent to the Second High Court for interrogation by the Anqing Bureau. Subsequently, according to Jia's confession, Zhang's residence was located, and the Public Security Bureau again requested the assistance of the French patrol police to arrest Zhang on the morning of the 25th of last month. The next day, she was sent to the Third High Court for interrogation. It has been slightly recorded in the previous report. Now, it is known that Zhang was the Minister of Organization of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party and was active in Shanghai. It is reported that when the Third High Court interrogated her, Zhang directly admitted to being a reactionary and was extremely harsh and argumentative in response to the court's questions, answering irrelevantly. On the same day, the Public Security Bureau sent personnel to welcome her and brought her clerk, Mr. Jia, to confront her. When Zhang saw Jia, she glared fiercely at him, wishing she could swallow Jia whole to relieve her hatred for revealing secrets. It is reported that on the same day, the court ruled that the defendant Zhang Xiulan should be handed over to the Public Security Bureau to be taken back for interrogation.</p>

Chinese and Western detectives rushed to the scene, first inspected the situation, and then took the shell away and temporarily stored it at the patrol station for investigation.</p>

<p>Wedding Held at the Minglun Hall of the Confucius Temple</p>
<p>Truly Breaking New Ground in Shanghai</p>
<p>|| Words of Mr. Cai Yuanpei ||</p>
<p>Dr. Ling Qihan, director of the Shen Bao Monthly, and Ms. Kang Su, a high-achieving student of the McTyeire School, held their wedding ceremony yesterday at the Minglun Hall inside the Municipal Public Education Center. Guests such as Cai Yuanpei, Zhang Yunhe, Pan Gongzhan, Ma Yinliang, Wang Zhixin, Zhang Yuanruo, Zhang Shutong, Chen Binhe, and Yang Qi, Wang Yongkang, Lu Shidao, etc. from the French Returned Students Association all attended, totaling over two hundred people. The hall was elegantly decorated. The ceremony commenced at 3:00 PM. Mr. Cai Yuanpei was invited to officiate, delivering a sincere speech. He recounted the changes in marriage systems throughout history, and praised Mr. Ling for not following popular customs, holding the wedding at the Minglun Hall of the academy, which he called the first of its kind in Shanghai. He concluded by wishing them a modern and fulfilling family life. His speech was both solemn and humorous, eliciting continuous applause from the audience. Mr. Chen Binhe, representing the guests, delivered a congratulatory speech, and then the ceremony concluded. It is said that Mr. Ling has long intended to reform old customs. Previously, there was no suitable public hall in Shanghai, so people had to hold weddings in small residences or hotels, with solemn ceremonies taking place in undignified venues, which was a regret for the citizens. Therefore, in February, he submitted a document to the Municipal Education Bureau, requesting permission to open the Minglun Hall of the Public Education Center as a public hall. The Bureau approved the request. Therefore, from now on, citizens will not have to worry about not having a solemn and dignified hall for their weddings.</p>

<p>Traveling Thousands of Miles to Hangzhou to Find Her Husband</p>
<p>Lost at the Station, Sent to the Bureau to Await Pickup</p>
<p>Gu Yun Sun, a local resident living at No. 112 Qinyifang, Sipailou, in the city, is over fifty years old. He has a son named Deshan, 24 years old, who is currently employed at the Hong Kong Post Office. Since childhood, Deshan has been engaged to a local woman named Li Aifen (milk name A Mei). They were married on March 19th of last year according to the old calendar. Due to work reasons, Deshan left Li and went to Hong Kong only ten days after the wedding. Li Aifen is only 29 years old, and is extremely beautiful. She studied at a certain girls' school. Although the two often exchanged love letters, she still found it difficult to express her accumulated feelings, leading to depression. Recently, she started talking nonsense and muttering incessantly. Her family did not take it seriously. Unexpectedly, the day before yesterday, Li, wearing a cheongsam and leather shoes, covered with a yellow Daoist robe, carrying incense candles and paper ingots, boarded the Shanghai-Hangzhou train to Hangzhou alone to offer incense. Unexpectedly, after getting off the train, due to being unfamiliar with the place, she was unable to find her way. So she wandered and looked around at the Hangzhou station. Later, she was spotted by a police officer stationed at the station, who questioned her. Li did not answer the questions asked, and said that she was going to Hong Kong to find her husband, constantly calling Deshan's name. The police officer, seeing that she seemed to have a mental illness, immediately took her back to the station. After the station chief inquired about her name and address in detail, he sent police officer He Debiao on a fast train to send Li to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau yesterday morning, waiting for her family to pick her up.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Zhang Juchuan Sues Zhang Huichong for Debt <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Huichong, the martial arts film star and former owner of Huichong Film Company, in November 1929, planned to produce the two films "(Love and Hate on the Sea and Sky)" and "(Huang Hai Pirate)", but lacked capital. He asked his brother-in-law Zhang Bingsheng to act as guarantor and borrowed 10,000 yuan from Central Cinema Company, signing a contract stating that after the two films were produced, the income from ticket sales at various cinemas managed by the company should be used to repay the debt. However, after the two films were released, the audience was sparse, and the income from ticket sales was only a little over one-third of the debt, making it impossible to fully repay the debt. On January 29, 1930, Zhang again entrusted Zhang Changfu, the late Chinese manager of Baidai Company, to borrow 2,000 yuan from Central Cinema Company, stating that the previous two films and a new film "(Parricide)" would be screened at the company's cinemas, and the income from ticket sales would be used to repay the debt. Unexpectedly, he repeated the same mistake. To date, apart from the deducted amounts, he still owes 7,306 yuan and 83 cents. Recently, the company found that Zhang was residing in Room 707 of the China Hotel on Guizhou Road. Therefore, manager Zhang Juchuan hired lawyers Zhan Jifeng and Zhan Yigang to sue Zhang and the guarantor Zhang Bingsheng, as well as Zhang Xiaomei (Zhang's daughter), the heir to Zhang Changfu's property, in the First Special Court, requesting Zhang Huichong to repay the amount in full. If Zhang cannot repay it, the guarantor Zhang Bingsheng should repay 5,550 yuan and 83 cents, and Zhang Xiaomei should repay 1,750 yuan, as well as statutory interest and litigation costs. The First Special Court opened a hearing yesterday presided over by Judge Qiao Wanxuan. Because this case has a hope of reconciliation, it was ordered to be rescheduled for further hearing.</p>

When the local court arrested Zou Shunjin, the investigation proved that there was joint embezzlement, so a public prosecution was filed. After repeated investigations and debates in the Criminal Court, Judge Shen opened the court yesterday to announce the verdict. Zou Shunjin was sentenced to four years of imprisonment for joint embezzlement. Chen Rongcai will be dealt with after he is arrested.</p>

<p>At around 10:00 AM yesterday, a ten-year-old girl named A'liu with the surname Xue, living at No. 20 Mianhuai Anli, opposite the entrance of Qunshou Li on Baker Road in the Public Concession, was crossing the road when a No. 17073 truck loaded with yellow sand and carrying many workers was traveling from east to west. The driver was unable to stop in time, causing the girl to be hit. The wheels ran over her head, and she fell to the ground in a pool of blood. Although people sent the girl to Baojiang Hospital for treatment, her skull was damaged and she lost too much blood, dying on the spot. The body has now been sent to the coroner's office for an autopsy. The driver who caused the accident was taken back to the Xinzha Police Station along with the car by the patrol officers to await delivery to the First Special District Local Court for trial.</p>

<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>I recently read your newspaper's April 29th article, "The Sichuan Bandits Are Approaching Exhaustion," which mentioned Tian Songyao stopping the offensive and raising funds to suppress the Red Army. This is completely contrary to the facts. Our army has extended the battle line by more than 400 miles since capturing Bazhong and Nanjiang. More than 60,000 troops have been mobilized to encircle and suppress the bandits in a large-scale operation. We have successively occupied key points such as Zhanmao Mountain, Shuangfengchang, Daxueya, Exiangjing, and Yuanbaosi, which belong to Tongjiang County. Tongjiang should be recovered in the short term. The people of the counties in northwestern Sichuan are freely donating funds to reward the army because of our army's efforts to suppress the Red Army. This is witnessed by all. To say that we have stopped the offensive and are raising funds to suppress the Red Army is inaccurate. We are providing a brief account of the situation and request a correction.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>I read in today's local news in your newspaper that "The International Settlement will be under temporary martial law tomorrow, May 1st (Labor Day)". The article mentioned that "The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions will hold a May 1st commemorative meeting at the Municipal Party Headquarters at 9 am". Our association is convening a city-wide labor commemorative meeting, which will be held at the Xiaoximen Youth Propaganda Corps. The statement in the draft is obviously untrue and may cause misunderstandings among the trade unions. We are sending a special letter to request a correction.</p>

<h3 id="e160">Can the Countryside Really Be Returned To? - A Further Discussion <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Editor's Note: The discussion on this issue is now coming to an end. This debate originated from two letters from Mr. Xiong Sheng and Mr. You Huaigao, followed by continuous letters from various parties, with seven or eight letters arriving every day. The discussion time has unconsciously extended to such a long time, which we did not expect. From this enthusiastic discussion, we can especially see how important this issue is to us, and how urgently we need to solve this problem. In fact, this is the whole way out for China. At the same time, we are deeply gratified that our readers have participated so enthusiastically in the debate, which shows that the general readers have considerable sympathy for this column. In addition to thanking the letter-writers, this is something we feel deeply comforted by. We originally intended to discuss this issue to a conclusion, but because the time has been extended for so long, and there are many other important letters waiting to be published, we have to announce the end of this discussion halfway. There are still many discussion letters, and the content is very exciting, but they cannot be disclosed. We feel very sorry, and we will publish them separately if there is an opportunity in the future. In this discussion, the focus of the problem is probably on whether it is possible to return to the countryside. The editor's personal opinion is that the focus of this issue is not on whether it is possible to return, but on (1) how to return to the countryside? (2) what to do when returning to the countryside? Therefore, I do not oppose returning to the countryside, but I want to ask what the purpose of returning to the countryside is. If there are correct answers to these two questions, all the secondary disputes can be easily solved. Secondly, in this debate, except for Mr. You Huaigao and Zhu Tianqing, most people said that the countryside cannot be returned to. They have mostly said very thoroughly the reasons why it cannot be returned to, but they have not provided active suggestions on how to remove the reasons why it cannot be returned to.</p>
<p>Even if there is any suggestion, it is very obscure. So there is a group of readers writing to ask: You say that the countryside cannot be returned to, what is your solution? If we do not return to the countryside, where is the way out? In fact, this question is very easy to answer. The first step is to ask whether the current Chinese countryside can be returned to? The answer is no. What is the root cause of why it cannot be returned to? A group of readers has already pointed out the details for me. Then we only need to remove the root cause of why it cannot be returned to, and the countryside can naturally be returned to. Conversely, if we want to return to the countryside, the first thing we can only do is to start by removing the root cause of why it cannot be returned to. There is no other solution. This originally does not need to be explained, since they have already pointed out for us the root cause of why it cannot be returned to, they have already told us the solution on the contrary. For example, in treating a disease, whether it is cold or hot, once the cause of the disease is clear, you only need to prescribe the right medicine. If you need to get to the bottom of it, then that's not very smart. What do you think, readers?</p>

<p>丨Letter from Mr. Zhang Fangyuan in this city丨</p>
<p>Now I sincerely ask, a student from Soviet China came and claimed that "Shishi Xinbao" once published a certain Mr. Miao Zhi organized a work-study group to Russia, with the mailing address at No. 1 Nishan Lane, Republic of China in Shanghai, and recruited young people to join. They are quite interested in joining. I am very cautious, so I am sending a quick letter to inquire. If you know anything, please let me know. The inquirers are:</p>
<p>1. Who is Miao Zhijie and what is his life story?</p>
<p>2. It is rumored that this matter is related to the Shanghai YMCA. Is this true?</p>
<p>3. Are the procedures for going abroad and arriving in Russia handled by Mr. Miao? Is it difficult for an individual to go to Russia?</p>
<p>4. Is there work to do in Russia?</p>
<p>I would be grateful if you could take the trouble to investigate and reply!</p>
<p>Reply: Regarding the work-study group to Russia, the reporter has also heard about it, and it is rumored that Mr. Chen Binhe and Mr. Hu Yuzhi are in charge of it. The reporter has inquired with Mr. Chen and Mr. Hu, and they said that there is no such thing. The reporter is also not very familiar with the content of the group. The letter says that some students are quite interested in joining, so it is appropriate to be cautious.</p>

<h3 id="e162">The Mission of the Sports Meet <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Luo Jialun</p>
<p>(Written for the Nanjing Four-School Joint Sports Meet)</p>
<p>A sports meet has two meanings:</p>
<p>The first is to promote national health and cultivate a healthy physique.</p>
<p>The second is to cultivate the demeanor of athletes and be a moral model for the nation.</p>
<p>The meaning of the first point is very clear. A healthy mind should reside in a healthy body. Moreover, there are many difficulties and hardships ahead for the Chinese nation. If the emerging generation does not have a persistent and hardworking physique, how can they bear the responsibility of building the country? Great things take time to develop. The success of many great politicians, military strategists,</p>
<p>great scholars, and great entrepreneurs in the world comes after the age of fifty or sixty. However, Chinese people often become old and retire by the age of fifty or sixty. If we do not try to save this situation by developing our physique, what can we imagine for the future of the nation?</p>
<p>The second point is even more important. What I call "the demeanor of athletes" is what ancient China called "the gentleman's competition", and what English calls "sportsmanship". ("A gentleman does not contend for anything. If he must, let it be in archery. He bows and yields as he ascends the platform, and drinks when he descends. His contention is that of a gentleman.") Modern sports have certain rules. According to these rules, in a public place, under the supervision of all eyes, they compete for victory or defeat, without using conspiracies, tricks, or extraneous actions. With their own efforts, they are subject to everyone's public judgment. They are not arrogant when they win, and they do not blame others when they lose. For example, after a tennis match, the winning and losing sides shake hands across the net. Everyone should know that after the US presidential election failed, the loser first sent a telegram to the winner to congratulate him, saying that we both presented our platforms to the people, and the people chose you. I respectfully congratulate you and wish you a smooth success in serving the country. This spirit comes from the sports field. That's different from Chinese politicians who, once they lose power, feel that nothing can be done and use all kinds of conspiracies to sabotage in secret. The reason why Chinese politics is not on track is also because the general public lacks the demeanor of athletes. If Chinese politics and society are to be on track, we must cultivate the demeanor of athletes as the standard of national morality.</p>
<p>A sports meet is not for individuals to compete for trophies. The mission of the sports meet is to cultivate the demeanor of athletes, to coordinate the actions of the group, and to jointly develop a healthy national physique, so that they can jointly shoulder the responsibility of building a new China in the future.</p>

Now, the Literacy Committee, in accordance with the planning outline, uses various schools, agencies, and other public places to allocate and supervise illiterate people to study. It has decided to set up 300 classes in the first phase within the possible scope. On the 7th and 8th of this month, the Public Security Bureau of the provincial capital sent students from the police academy to deliver the study notices, ordering them to attend classes on schedule.

They have been mailed to the Shanghai Commercial Press for zinc plate production, and the content and printing are extremely perfect. The price is also extremely low. Since the opening of the People's School on the 11th, the public has been very enthusiastic about learning. The total number of students in the first phase is more than 3,000. It is expected that the number of classes in the second and third phases will gradually increase in order to accommodate them.</p>

<h3 id="e170">County Agricultural Education Center Notifies Schools to Trial Chicken Farming <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Zhuanqiao Farmers' Education Center, in order to trial chicken farming in schools, to enhance children's interest and ability in production, and to inspire their aspirations to improve agriculture, has designated various schools to trial chicken farming. Yesterday, it specifically sent letters to various schools for their information. The original letter is recorded below: Chicken farming is one of the farmer's sideline occupations. Unfortunately, the breeds of chickens are poor, and the feeding methods are inadequate. Those that lay many eggs may not have delicious meat, and those with large bodies may not lay many eggs. To improve the lives of farmers, it is necessary to first seek chicken breeds that are suitable for both eggs and meat. Our center aims to improve chicken breeds and enhance children's interest and ability in production, as well as to inspire children's aspirations and knowledge to improve their lives and agriculture. We plan to conduct trial breeding in schools within this district, which has been approved by the County Education Bureau under directive number 151, and the amended school chicken farming methods have been issued. At this time of the sunny spring, it is the best season for raising chicks. The 189th center affairs meeting of our center designated Zhuanqiao Primary School, Beiqiao Primary School, Jingze Primary School, ZhengGang Primary School, Shangbin Primary School, Yucai Primary School, Dongqiao Primary School, Caoan Primary School, and Xingang Primary School as trial chicken farming schools. We have selected chicks of dual-purpose (egg and meat) breeds and will distribute them to the schools for breeding on May 1st. In addition to informing you, we are sending you the trial school chicken farming methods for your reference and action.</p>

<h3 id="e173">Ministry of Education Edits Methods for Textbooks Used in Primary and Secondary Schools <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>▲ Upon Completion, It May Entrust Book Companies to Print and Distribute</p>
<p>The Executive Yuan meeting on the 25th passed the Ministry of Education's proposal to compile its own textbooks for primary and secondary schools, which has been reported in this newspaper. We now have a copy of the original proposal from the Ministry of Education, which is recorded below:</p>
<p>Regarding the proposal: The textbooks for primary and secondary schools in our country have always been subject to a review and approval system, whereby book companies hire private individuals to edit them, and the government reviews them. After approval, they can be freely published and distributed. This system aims to encourage private writing, so that textbooks can be improved through free competition. However, today, it is also necessary for the government to compile its own textbooks for primary and secondary schools, to be used in parallel with the already approved private works. The reasons are as follows:</p>
<p>1. To Implement National Rejuvenation: National rejuvenation is the key to saving China today. If primary and secondary school textbooks can focus on national rejuvenation, the impact will be profound and related to the future of the nation. However, to rejuvenate the nation, the government must first have a consistent policy, which is more effective when unified and directed by the government. Therefore, primary and secondary school textbooks should be compiled by the government and not merely entrusted to book companies or other private individuals.</p>
<p>2. To Enforce Curriculum Standards: The curriculum standards for primary and secondary schools have been approved by the central government and promulgated by the Ministry of Education. To strictly implement these standards, the government must issue new textbooks that precisely match these standards in order to achieve results. If book companies continue to hire private individuals to edit them, the drawbacks of changing the appearance and plagiarizing old editions will be unavoidable. Even without these drawbacks, there may still be significant differences.</p>
<p>3. To Set an Example for Textbooks: Although there have been improvements in primary and secondary school textbooks in our country over the past thirty years, they have always been edited by private individuals, and the government has not provided active guidance. Therefore, progress has been slow. Although textbooks do not need to adopt a national system, to promote the long-term progress of textbooks, the government should specially compile a set as a demonstration, which is the most effective method of active guidance, far superior to the passive work of simply reviewing and approving them.</p>
<p>Based on the above reasons, the Ministry of Education began preparations last year. In recent months, it has planned to start compiling textbooks for primary and secondary schools for use in primary and secondary schools across the country, and has purchased the latest edited textbooks for primary and secondary schools from Europe, the United States, Japan, and other countries. Several of these have already been translated for reference during the editing process. The proposed implementation methods are described as follows:</p>
<p>1. Types of Textbooks:</p>
<p>A. A complete set of textbooks and teaching materials for all subjects in primary school.</p>
<p>B. A complete set of necessary reference books and wall charts for primary school.</p>
<p>C. A complete set of textbooks for all subjects in secondary school.</p>
<p>2. Those in Charge of Compilation:</p>
<p>A. Primary school textbooks will be handled by the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Education in conjunction with the Compilation and Translation Bureau.</p>
<p>B. Secondary school textbooks will be handled by the National Compilation and Translation Bureau in conjunction with the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Education.</p>
<p>3. Various Textbooks Will Be Completed in Three Phases:</p>
<p>A. Phase 1: Completed by the end of November 1933, published in April 1934.</p>
<p>B. Phase 2: Completed by the end of February 1934, published in July 1934.</p>
<p>C. Phase 3: Completed by the end of August 1934, published in December 1935.</p>
<p>4. Budget.</p>
<p>5. Distribution Method After Completion:</p>
<p>A. The Ministry may entrust book companies to print and distribute them.</p>
<p>B. To be used in parallel with privately compiled textbooks that have been approved by the government.▲ Budget for Compiling Primary and Secondary School Textbooks</p>

<p>▲ Plans to Compete with Mai Ling Hai, Pirates, Donghua, etc.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Southern Basketball Team, organized by the elite players of the South China basketball scene, has campaigned in Shantou and Xiamen, where they were victorious in every encounter. For the purpose of exchanging skills, the team, led by Mr. Bao Rongheng, has come to Shanghai from Xiamen to test the waters. They have already arrived in Shanghai and are staying at the Great Eastern Hotel. A summary of the team's strength and plans for their visit to Shanghai is provided below.</p>
<p>▲ Strength: The players on the team are all outstanding talents from the Hong Kong Youth Association and the Chung Nam Athletic Association, which are the recent basketball champions of Hong Kong. They are also from the Wah Nam College team, which has won the inter-school basketball championship for two consecutive years. They have campaigned in various parts of South China and have been invincible in every encounter. Their strength is extremely formidable. Believing that Shanghai's basketball skills are outstanding, they are making their maiden voyage to Shanghai to test the waters.</p>
<p>▲ Players: The team has seven players, whose names are as follows: Chen Ruzheng (Chung Nam Association), Liu Dexiu (Chung Nam Association), Li Peiyan (Youth Association), Lu Zhenxuan (Youth Association), Pan Yaojun (Youth Association), Chen Shihong (Youth Association), Su Bohui (Youth Association). Players such as Chen, Yang, and Lu are all Hong Kong inter-port players.</p>
<p>▲ Challenge: Before coming to Shanghai, the team did not contact the National Sports Association of China regarding matters such as representative matches. Therefore, although they have arrived in Shanghai, the teams and locations for the matches have not been determined. However, according to Mr. Bao Rongheng of the team, they are currently contacting strong teams such as the Mai Ling Si, Pirates, Donghua, Fudan, and St. John's to arrange matches, and the dates are likely to be soon.</p>

<p>The English team applied pressure from the start, with five lines of troops invading in different directions. The strong central defense line formed a encirclement, and the Chinese team was flustered and trapped in the circle. At this time, Chen Zhenhe, who had been away from the field for a long time, was unanimously supported. He wiggled his feet and dribbled the ball out of danger, boosting the morale of the team. Li Yichen and Sun Jinshun advanced side by side, and in the blink of an eye, the English goal was in sight. Unfortunately, it was ruled offside. Seeing that the enemy's momentum was still strong, Li Te went down the right wing, passing to the center. Hai Te Lai skillfully dodged Wang Shusen, using a trick under his feet, taking advantage of the other's unpreparedness and passing to the left. Left winger Xu Shi was waiting for orders. A ball came across, and he fell forward and shot, hitting the net in response. It was a beautiful goal, and the iron gate, like Zhou Xianyan, could do nothing about it.</p>

<p>After losing a goal, the Chinese team reorganized its formation, hoping to recover. Tu Kaiyuan took a long-range free kick, which was caught by Brett Lai with a jump, turning it into a corner kick. Wan Xianghua shot accurately, and in the crowd of figures, Chen Jiaqiu secretly sent a foot, inches away from the goal. An interesting thing suddenly happened. From the left side outside the penalty area of the English goal, the Chinese team got a free kick. Chen Yutian was going to execute it, but the ball suddenly deflated. He changed to an old ball, but it was also unsuitable. He changed to another ball. At this time, Chen Yutian secretly sent a wink, and Tu Kaiyuan responded with a smile. Electric waves were transmitted to each other, and they understood each other. A kick came over, and Tu Kaiyuan stepped forward and shot, hitting the net and tying the score. Five minutes later, the Wan-Sun-Li triangle alliance collapsed the enemy's fort. Sun Jinshun lived up to his mission and returned victoriously. In the first half, China took the lead 2-1.</p>

<p>The Western front had been quiet for a long time, and the strong men felt like they were developing fat on their thighs. They had no choice but to shorten each half of the first half by thirty minutes to remedy this. The situation in the second half turned dull. After ten minutes, Wang Shusen was penalized for saving the day, and a penalty kick was awarded. Zhou Xianyan rubbed his fists, preparing to resist. Captain Gai personally executed the kick, but he kicked it out diagonally, intentionally giving up, or perhaps he missed the target. It is unknown. Afterwards, the time passed in a playful manner. Both sides shot as soon as they got the ball, regardless of its effectiveness. Towards the end, it became more and more lax. Generally, the winner had no intention of trying again, and the loser was also confident that the hard work would be futile. The referee gave the order to retreat, and both sides returned to their teams in an orderly manner. The result was 2-1, with China winning. Referee Ai Quexun, linesmen Li Silian and Shen Huichun.</p>

<p>The East Asia Institute of Physical Education in Lujiawan, this city, has been established for fifteen years and has achieved remarkable results and a nationwide reputation. It is the only physical education specialty school in this city. In this year's Shanghai Secondary School Games, the Attached Physical Education Teachers School won the men's and women's track and field championships in the physical education school category, scoring a total of 123 points, which is rare in various sports events. Group performances such as national martial arts and group exercises were also ranked first. The Boy Scout observation tower performance was particularly outstanding and was awarded a special prize at the meeting. Guanghua, which won four men's championships in this year's Secondary School Games, was guided by Lu Xiangqian, a graduate of the school. Huadong, which won the women's runner-up, was also trained by Xu Jiazeng, a graduate of the school. The private Shanghai Middle School, China Vocational Middle School, and Wusong Junior Middle School, which won awards for group performances, were all guided by Wang Huaiying, Zhang Shifang, and Zhang Zihe, graduates of the school.

<p>Yesterday, we received a letter from Wu Meixian, which reads: "Dear Sir, yesterday I read in your sports column that I usually practice without listening to guidance, and I was very surprised. Since I arrived at the school, I have been busy with my studies and have not practiced much. Even recently, I have only practiced a little, and Chen Bingde Xing has also been busy and unable to provide guidance. Therefore, the statement that I do not listen to guidance is probably a misrepresentation. It is the duty of an athlete to obey guidance. I hope you will include this in the letter column to make a correction. Sincerely, Wu Meixian, 30th."</p>

<p>— Pang Jingzhou</p>
<p>Chapter 4: Business Conditions</p>
<p>(B) The Business of New Medicines</p>
<p>I have proposed to the Physicians' Association to form another committee to properly organize the new drug catalog, publications, and explanations. It has been passed, but so far very little work has been done. I will write another article about the methods and opinions another day.</p>
<p>Under the current situation, the most important thing is naturally the pharmaceutical factory. Although most of the chemical raw materials are still imported, the imitation and preparation can still block some loopholes. It is a pity that there are only four or five such pharmaceutical factories in Shanghai, such as New Asia, Shinyi, and Fukang. The capital is still insufficient, and the products are not very abundant. Moreover, the psychology of worshiping foreign goods cannot be avoided from the patient's side to the doctor's side. Therefore, the business of pharmaceutical factories is not very developed. This matter needs to be promoted by the society.</p>
<p>Shanghai can be said to be the largest market for new medicines in the country. Even the medicines used by hospitals and doctors in various parts of the interior are supplied by these ten or so Cheng Le merchants, twenty or so formula merchants (also engaged in wholesale), five or six pharmaceutical factories, and a part of the larger foreign pharmacies (small pharmacies opened by Russians in the city have no ability to promote medicines to the interior), and several resident managers of foreign pharmaceutical factories. In total, the number of merchants is less than half of the old-fashioned Chinese medicine shops in Shanghai (exclusively selling in this city). Although the northern provinces are supplied by Tianjin, Qingdao, and other places, the abdominal provinces are supplied by Hankou, the Yunnan and Guizhou provinces are imported from Saigon, and the Guangdong medicines are imported from Hong Kong, either they are still Shanghai branch offices, or there are not many shops. All have factual evidence that can be investigated. From the north, it can be proved that the total number of medical equipment and medicines that our country relies on from foreigners is not surprising. The cause of new medicine is not developed at all. However, now the general advocacy of preserving old medicine often takes the outflow of rights and interests and the language of promoting domestic goods to sensationalize. The government officials also think that (scientific medicine should be promoted, but the leakage of Western medicines is too great, so it is better to cut your feet to fit your shoes and open Chinese medicine halls. But on the one hand, they rely on the American wheat, cotton, Saigon rice, German rayon, and all the necessities of daily life from foreigners, but they do not consider it very much and say (promote national agriculture). (Promote the national quintessence of sericulture)? Alas! Giving up the root and pursuing the branches, what is going on? (End of this section)</p>

<p>— Sun Huajun</p>
<p>(1) How can we avoid the occurrence of infectious diseases?</p>
<p>Infectious diseases are the greatest enemies of health and life. Preventing them from entering the body and causing illness is the primary condition for protecting health. We know that the cause of infectious diseases is bacteria. They must invade our bodies to cause illness. If we can cut off their path of invasion, the disease will not occur. The paths of invasion are: (1) Transmission through food, entering the stomach and intestines through the mouth, such as typhoid fever, cholera, dysentery, and intestinal parasites. The prevention method is to avoid eating raw water and raw vegetables, especially in summer, and not to eat cold food that flies have landed on, as well as spoiled food. Do not use the tableware used by patients, and pay attention to disinfecting patients' feces and urine. (2) Transmission through the air, entering the lungs through the nose, such as pulmonary tuberculosis, pneumonia, plague, and influenza. The prevention method is to stay away from patients, keep a distance of at least five feet when talking, and do not use tableware used by patients. Diphtheria enters the body through the mouth or nose. (3) Transmission through contact between bodies via viruses, such as venereal diseases and scabies. The prevention method is to stay away from unclean women, and not to have sexual relations with suspicious women. If it is unavoidable, use protective devices such as condoms or "Ruyi bags." If problems arise, see a formal doctor early to avoid being beyond remedy. (4) Entry into the body through skin wounds via viruses, such as various suppurative diseases and anthrax. Therefore, when the skin is broken, attention should be paid to disinfection. (5) Transmission through bites of animals via viruses, such as mosquitoes for malaria, fleas for plague, and mad dogs for rabies. The prevention method is simply to isolate such animals. For example, mosquito nets can prevent mosquitoes, and long boots can prevent fleas. Such prevention should be handled according to the situation at any time and in any place.</p>
<p>(2) How can we strengthen the body and increase resistance?</p>
<p>The resistance of our body is an essential element of health, the driving force for resisting disease. Everyone should pay attention to and improve it to make the body stronger. Many people believe in getting blood-boosting injections and taking supplements to achieve this goal, but this is a mistake. Natural sunlight, fresh air, and light are the real tonics. Gentlemen, do not think this is just old-fashioned talk. These three treasures can not only strengthen the body, but also are good medicine for treating lung diseases. Don't you see how strong and energetic the Germans are? Their secret is to use these three treasures. We Shanghai people live in the city, our houses are as small as pigeon nests, our lives are unstable, our habits are bad, and we lack these three substances, resulting in pale complexions and listless spirits. Why not make an effort to absorb these real tonics that cost nothing? As long as people exercise in fresh air for half an hour every day and see the sunlight, I guarantee your body will be stronger than taking medicine and injections. As for exercise, we do not advocate doing strenuous competitive sports such as running and playing ball, because they are harmful to the body. The best are flexible exercises or Tai Chi, because the movements of the muscles are even and do not harm the heart and lungs. The most important thing is not to interrupt. This ultraviolet light is especially useful for busy people. Exposing yourself to the sun for at least ten minutes a day will definitely make your body healthy and beautiful.</p>
<p>However, exercise cannot be excessive. It is especially unsuitable for people with heart and lung diseases, otherwise the problem will worsen. Exposure to sunlight and ultraviolet light is not necessarily good. For example, people with lung disease and fever, and some people with skin diseases, cannot be exposed to it. So, how can it be considered complete? We can say that all people who want to obtain health and maintain health cannot be separated from the management and guidance of doctors.</p>
<h3 id="e189">Advice to Those Suffering from Venereal Diseases (Part 2) <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>(4) In addition to using slogans of cheapness and good quality to attract customers, they are also afraid that patients are not at ease, so they came up with a kind of policy to explain that if it is not cured or not fully cured by the due date, the diagnosis fee can be refunded, etc. They even say that they can use the health bureau's verification form as proof. Of course, anyone can listen to this kind of talk, but is it really the case? We know that the spread and cessation of any disease is sometimes very unpredictable, and it is not exactly the same as the fixed model said in books; and every disease has the possibility of developing other complications (even mild diseases are the same). Although it is said that various methods can be used in advance to prevent it, it is not always possible in reality. Venereal diseases are no exception, so it is not possible for a doctor to guarantee a full recovery when diagnosing a disease. Although he may see many cases get better. As for the insurance policy, there is no need to mention it! Even if we take a step back, since this matter is voluntary, it is inconvenient for others to criticize. Then I might as well explain a few more words to the patient about the verification form. Regarding the general rules of verification, only positive numbers (i.e., addition, meaning existence) have value in theory, and negative numbers (i.e., subtraction, meaning non-existence) have little value. For example, if a person's Wassermann reaction is negative, then we cannot say that he is definitely free of syphilis now, or even that he has been completely cured; the same is true for the absence of gonorrhea bacteria in the examination of leucorrhea, and the absence of tuberculosis bacilli in the sputum of tuberculosis. Positive numbers are easy to get when the symptoms are obvious, but not so for latent ones. By the time syphilis reaches the third stage (brain syphilis and spinal cord sputum), the clinical diagnosis is very reliable, but the blood test is not necessarily positive: when leucorrhea develops into unilateral arthritis, if his urethra has no changes, then no cocci can be found. If the patient goes to question him at this time why he has not been completely cured, he can take the verification form as his defense, what else can you say! The clever ones, of course, say that you have another disease, and his treatment of sputum is not the same as before, and you are not clear about it. Even if the examination is not negative, they can casually point out a small section of your daily life, saying that it was caused by your carelessness (we have always had a saying that when urinating, you will get turbid pain if you are suddenly exposed to cold wind; many people believe this, and there are many similar cases, so they can of course point it out casually). Or they may even say that you are newly infected. What can you argue! Moreover, five or six out of ten patients with venereal diseases are deeply reluctant to talk about it, and Chinese people are naturally inclined to avoid trouble and not be too demanding; even if there is really something wrong that is seen, no one will bother to do anything. So their tricks will never be exposed.</p>
<p>Based on the above circumstances, the following two general rules can be discovered, namely, the easier the diagnosis, the less reliable it is; the more exaggerated the advertisement, the more careful you should be; I will explain these two separately below:</p>
<p>(1) This one is probably very easy to cause misunderstanding. Because diagnosis is sometimes not easy, but sometimes you only need to rely on a clinical examination to know the general situation. There is also a lot of evidence for this, but taking venereal diseases as an example, the diagnosis is not very difficult for the initial stage of acute leucorrhea, when syphilis occurs in the whole body, and when the symptoms of spinal cord sputum are obvious. But I am completely speaking for a reason. Because most of these doctors do not have a real foundation in medicine, their knowledge is half from fixed books and half from hearsay. They know what is natural but do not know why, they know the model venereal disease type but do not know the various variations; so their diagnosis and treatment of diseases only have arbitrary mistakes, and there will be no hesitant places, which is conceivable. Furthermore, they are timid and afraid of being exposed, if they cannot report a disease for a while, they are afraid that the patient will not feel at ease, so this kind of mistake is the easiest for them to make.</p>
<p>(2) I am definitely not saying that doctors' advertisements should not be published, but I do not approve of exaggerated and overly deceptive propaganda! This is also what they are used to, and they can almost take care of everything; in addition to newspapers and regular daily, weekly, and monthly publications, there are also various innovative slogans on the clinic's door and window glass, just like a newly opened theater or restaurant. This is their only sign. People who have lived in Shanghai for a long time probably already know the truth; but there are still many people who come from other places and are deceived. So I also do not mind being trivial and put it forward to remind patients to pay attention.</p>
<p>The things that patients should pay attention to when seeking medical treatment, I have written all that I know! Of course, this kind of situation is definitely not limited to the venereal disease part, but it is undoubtedly true that it accounts for the majority. In addition, I have a few things that I hope patients themselves will pay attention to:</p>
<p>(1) The period of relief from the pain of venereal diseases is sometimes not very difficult, and the time is not long, but complete recovery and prevention of future complications are not simple, and the treatment time is also very long; it is definitely not the case that you can count on it just because you feel that your body has no major pain or one examination report. Chronic leucorrhea is especially stubborn and difficult to cure. Therefore, patients must not be too impatient, and temporary gains and losses are not very important: definitely do not be optimistic because of short-term treatment that is slightly effective, and vice versa.</p>
<p>(2) Patients should pay attention to the choice of doctors before seeking medical treatment; but after the choice has been made, the decision must be firm.</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>It is absolutely impossible to change the plan because of temporary small gains and losses, which is harmful and not beneficial.</p>
<p>(3) Patients often seek medical treatment through proper methods during diagnosis and treatment, but if they do not see immediate results, they seek medical treatment from other doctors. However, if other doctors diagnose that the previous treatment method was correct and the plan was the same as before, they are often not happy. They even ask the doctor to change other methods. This kind of psychology of excessively valuing novelty is of no benefit to the disease itself.</p>
<p>(4) Patients often like to participate in opinions during diagnosis, and even seek medical treatment on the one hand, and use their own legendary methods on the other hand. As a result, they get into trouble and seek trouble for themselves, so they should pay special attention.</p>

<p>(2) Appendix</p>
<p>During childbirth, the delivery room should have medical equipment, all of which are prepared by the obstetrician. It is not necessary to repeat this here. The items that the family should prepare are listed below:</p>
<p>Sheets, oilcloth or oil paper, gauze, cotton, bathtub, clothes for the baby and the mother, large towels, small towels, belly wrap, safety pins (in large quantities), cold water, boiling water, etc.</p>
<p>The midwife should check and record the newborn and its appendages:</p>
<p>(1) Infant body: Number of fetuses delivered: alive or dead, gender, weight, height</p>
<p>Head measurements: fontanelles, sutures, birth tumors, etc.</p>
<p>Overall development status: any deformities</p>
<p>(2) Umbilical cord: thickness, length, gelatinous substance, development status, nodules, etc.</p>
<p>(3) Amnion: size of rupture, shape, location, etc.</p>
<p>(4) Placenta: weight, shape, size, thickness, any defects or accessory placenta, etc.</p>
<p>(5) Record of the delivery process: from the beginning of labor pains to the end of delivery after expulsion, and the amount of blood during the delivery process must be recorded in detail. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Monster Fetus</p>
<p>Li Xiaofu is a coppersmith, living at No. 4, Xiezhen Lane, Zhongxing Road, Zhabei. His wife, Ms. Lu, is 28 years old and from Wuxi. She became pregnant last year, her fourth pregnancy. Labor started at 4:00 AM on December 29th last year. At 1:00 PM, the midwife Wang Jiangshi, who had been hired, forcibly pulled out the baby's head. At 5:00 PM, she pulled out the baby's hand, but the entire fetus was still difficult to deliver. Therefore, Li Xiaofu sent the pregnant woman to the Sino-German Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital on Zhangjiabang Road, Jing'an Temple Road in this city. She was admitted to the hospital at 11:00 PM. The hospital's doctor then used surgery to remove the entire fetus, only to find that it was a deformed baby of the hydrops fetalis type (see attached picture). The neck was thin and long, the abdomen was as big as a drum, the limbs were soft, the tissue was incomplete, and the genitals had eight testicles, which was unprecedented. The whole body was scarred, caused by the midwife's reckless pulling. It is now reported that this deformed fetus has been taken by the Academia Sinica for research, and a report will be available soon.</p>

<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>▲ Malaria</p>
<p>Q: How does malaria start?</p>
<p>A: It is caused by a type of sporozoan parasite that lives inside blood cells.</p>
<p>Q: How can malaria sporozoans invade the human body's blood?</p>
<p>A: Because this sporozoan parasite first lives in the stomach of a type of mosquito (called an Anopheles mosquito), when the Anopheles mosquito sucks blood, it enters the human blood along with the mosquito's saliva.</p>
<p>Q: Does this disease have other names?</p>
<p>A: There are vulgar names such as "San Yin Malaria," "Cold and Heat Disease," and "Hitting the Board," and there is also the alternative name "Intermittent Fever."</p>
<p>Q: What is the Western name?</p>
<p>A: Malaria, also known as Febris intermittens. In German, it is also called Wechselieber.</p>
<p>Q: Where and in what season is malaria most common?</p>
<p>A: It occurs a lot in the tropics and in the south of our country. It is more common in spring and autumn than in winter.</p>
<p>Q: How many days does it take to develop the disease after we are infected with malaria sporozoans?</p>
<p>A: It takes ten to fourteen days to develop the disease.</p>
<p>Q: What are the main symptoms of malaria?</p>
<p>A: Periodic intermittent fever.</p>
<p>Q: Is this intermittent period fixed?</p>
<p>A: There are those that occur every other day, called tertian fever; those that occur every two days, called quartan fever; and there are also those that are irregular and dangerous, called malignant malaria or tropical malaria.</p>
<p>Q: What are the symptoms of tertian fever and quartan fever?</p>
<p>A: Mostly, a sudden onset of severe chills and shivering, pale face, cold skin, and small pulse occur first, then the body temperature rises, and the skin becomes hot. After this, the pulse becomes fuller and faster, and the spleen swells up. In addition, there are complaints of limb pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, crawling rash on the face, and hypersensitivity of the skin. Finally, sweating occurs and the fever subsides. On average, the body temperature returns to normal in six to ten hours. (To be continued)</p>
<p>What is (Sha Medicine Water)? As the name suggests, this is certainly a liquid for treating Sha symptoms. However, the (Sha Medicine Water) that the general public recognizes now is not so simple. The term (Sha Medicine Water) does include (Ten Drops Water), (Life-Saving Water), (Universal Relief Water), (Benefit-the-Public Water), (Miraculous Benefit-the-Public Water):: etc., etc., many waters. I can't count them all at once. Although the instructions state what diseases it treats, how to take it, and how much to take each time, the general public often does not pay attention to it. They even regard this kind of (Sha Medicine Water) as a (universal) (elixir). It seems that no matter what symptoms there are, it is okay to use it, and it really has the effect of (curing the disease with medicine) and (bringing the dead back to life). Such excessive trust in (Sha Medicine Water) even makes people think that it is an essential treasure for (home and travel). In fact, they simply don't understand what (Sha Medicine Water) is made of, what its function is!</p>
<p>The preparation of Sha Medicine Water is roughly composed of (cardiotonic) and (sedative) drugs. Because it has the function of strengthening the heart, it can be used to urgently rescue all cases of syncope caused by severe vomiting, diarrhea, excessive labor, accidental stimulation, etc. And because it has a sedative effect, it can also stop vomiting and diarrhea, relieve pain, and inhibit cramps and spasms.</p>
<p>What I have to explain to you is that the effect of cardiotonic drugs is threefold: (1) to inhibit excessive excitement of myocardial contraction; (2) to promote the function of myocardial contraction. The effects of the two are contrary to each other, and there are many differences in the application. However, the functions of the two can sometimes complement each other. This is certainly not something that this article can fully explain in detail. If the cardiotonic drugs in Sha Medicine Water mostly have both functions, they certainly have an effect when applied to mild or non-serious heart failure. (In severe heart failure, paralysis is too severe, and oral medicine rarely works.) However, when used in excess, the heart cannot bear the stimulation. Excessive excitement is really enough to make the heart dysfunctional and endanger life. It is like drinking alcohol. Drinking a little can indeed stimulate the activity of the myocardium and increase blood circulation, and you often feel physically and mentally comfortable. Overdoing it will get you drunk, and drunk you will be crazy. This is still in the transition period of excitement and paralysis. In an instant, from madness to sleep, sleep and sound sleep, even unconscious. This is because it has shifted from the excitement period to the anesthetic state, resulting in excessive excitement, causing cerebral congestion or blood vessels to burst and die. There are also many real cases of sudden syncope due to excessive heart palpitations and exhaustion. Therefore, it is said that (too much is as bad as too little), and the disaster may be even worse.</p>
<p>The effect of sedatives is that they can stop vomiting and diarrhea, relieve pain and inhibit spasms, as mentioned earlier. Therefore, this type of drug mostly contains (narcotics). It has the function of inhibiting nerve excitement; it has special effects on anesthetizing peripheral nerves or central nerves. They all belong to (powerful drugs) or (toxic drugs). When used properly, they work quickly. When used improperly, they can endanger life. Even if it doesn't kill you, there are often many side effects. Please set an example to illustrate its generality.</p>
<p>(Opium) is enough to help increase energy, which is its stimulating effect on the nerves. At the same time, it also has a pain-relieving effect, which is also its anesthetic effect. Anyone who has ever smoked opium to relieve pain can tell you about it. Those who smoke more than one tube often find that although the pain is relieved, they feel dizzy, dry mouth, nausea and upset, which is also called (seeking benefit but getting loss). However, this is still not enough to endanger life. If opium is used as an oral or injectable agent, without following the regulations, there are few who are not poisoned. Opium's anesthetic effect is especially harmful to the central respiratory nerves. Once breathing stops, the source of oxygen is cut off. Even if the heart is not weak, what good is it? Those who enter in this way are close to the underworld!</p>
<p>Recently, various (Sha Medicine Water) sold in shops. The formulations are certainly numerous. There must be many who mix (opium wine) or (opium smoke water). There are even those who use (pet heads water) as medicine and mix it with wine agents or water and wine to become what is called Sha Medicine Water, which is certainly not completely without harm. Many people have not noticed it. There are many types of Sha Medicine Water, and the formulations are different. However, in my opinion, it is nothing more than the aforementioned two types of drugs combined. There are also those who use prescriptions from old Chinese medicine and mix them with Western medicine, which is something I dare not discuss. However, I have seen people who excessively trust Sha Medicine Water and are harmed by misuse, and I feel sorry and worried about it! Now I will briefly give a few examples to illustrate it.</p>
<p>(1) A certain merchant woke up in the morning with a slight abdominal pain. Fearing that he had Sha symptoms, he took the specially prepared (Sha Medicine Water) and drank it, and the pain stopped. After about two hours, the pain recurred. He took Sha Medicine Water again to treat it, but it didn't work, so he drank more of it, and after a while, the pain began to subside. However, he felt deeply troubled and didn't know how to feel better. He went on to rub and scrape it, and red Sha clearly appeared around his neck and chest and back. He thought that the Sha root had been removed and the disease was okay. However, the abdominal pain came again in no time, even worse than before. Panicked and crying out in pain, he took Sha Medicine Water again and drank it, half a bottle without effect, then another half a bottle. The pain did not decrease, and he vomited non-stop, bringing up all the food from the previous night, but still not stopping. He sweated and breathed quickly, his hands were cold and cramped, the pain was even more intense, and his condition was critical. He was rushed to the hospital. Upon questioning, the above-mentioned statement was obtained. In total, he took about three bottles of Sha Medicine Water in four hours. After examination, there were already signs of poisoning. And the so-called main symptom was that he had been constipated for four days. He had first felt abdominal pain the other day and relied entirely on Sha Medicine Water to cure it. So they washed his stomach to clear the remnants of Sha Medicine Water, and his intestines to clear his stool. After the stool was passed, the disease was indeed cured immediately. This is truly what is called (There is nothing wrong in the world, fools trouble themselves)!</p>
<p>(What would have happened if this merchant had not vomited after taking Sha Medicine Water for the third time?) It must be said that (it would have been bad). However, people attribute the merchant's good fortune in not dying to vomiting. In fact, the reason for his rescue was not only this. If the so-called (Sha Medicine Water) he took was (Ten Drops Water), its dose was strong, and the anesthetic it contained might have caused the taker to be incurable early on? Fortunately, the Sha Medicine Water he took was not very strong, and because it was separated by some time, it was not very dangerous: he saw the opportunity early and sought medical treatment immediately: and he was able to directly admit that he had taken a large amount of Sha Medicine Water, avoiding wasting the doctor's examination. If the Sha Medicine Water he took was not vomited out, because of the excessive dose, he would have entered a state of drunkenness. By the time others discovered it, they could not prove whether he had taken Sha Medicine Water or other drugs; or even if he had been given it by others, he would conceal and avoid fault, and would not be willing to speak. Doctors will encounter a lot of trouble. Even if there are slight symptoms of poisoning, they must pay attention to it. After showing the effect, it is necessary to advise the patient not to follow the same path.</p>

<h3 id="e192">On Foreign Bagu <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Xuan</p>
<p>Where there is "country," there is "foreign." With domestic bagu, there is naturally so-called foreign bagu.</p>
<p>Domestic bagu is a means for emperors to unify thought. Similarly, ancient and modern crowned and uncrowned emperors in foreign countries have the same trick. In contrast to domestic bagu, that is foreign bagu.</p>
<p>This is one explanation of foreign bagu. It can also be said to be the original meaning of foreign bagu.</p>
<p>Since maritime trade opened, foreign goods have been imported into China, followed by disrupting China's original socio-economic organization. Thus, domestic bagu lost its function and had to beg for help from foreign bagu. Thus, we have foreign bagu here. This kind of foreign bagu is meant to replace domestic bagu to (correct people's hearts and resist heresies). For example, fascism is the latest foreign bagu.</p>
<p>Foreigners also have other bagu. For example, in places where fascism does not work well, there is social democracy, a type of foreign bagu. China is a complex country, so some people have imported this foreign bagu, although sales have not been very smooth.</p>
<p>In addition, Kemal of Turkey and Gandhi of India are both (bagu masters;) their bagu is a different style, but their convergence with orthodox foreign bagu (different paths to the same destination) is already a widely seen effect. Therefore, we have also put up big advertisements for them in our market.</p>
<p>Foreign bagu also has two proud writing styles: anesthesia and deception. Although these are (unorthodox), their power is no less than that of a frontal direct approach. Domestic bagu also had this kind of trick, but it is never as good as foreign bagu in researching these to infinite variations and unpredictable wonders. And judging from recent facts, our foreign bagu students are not weaker than their teachers in these two aspects!</p>
<p>Now the Washington Conference is about to open. Maybe there will be an amazing foreign bagu, we'll wait and see!</p>
<p>Foreign bagu has other explanations, but that is not within the topic today, we will talk about it when we have the opportunity in the future.</p>

<p>— Zhang Xuezhen</p>
<p>In the past two or three years, during the rainy seasons of summer and autumn, whenever we had a broken umbrella at home, my mother would tell me to take it out to be repaired. I would habitually run to Wang Shun's umbrella repair shop! Calling it a shop might be an exaggeration; it was just a dark little room. The counter had become smooth and shiny from years of being touched.</p>
<p>(Shopkeeper, please fix this umbrella for me.)</p>
<p>(Alright), an old man would put down the work in his hands with a smile and stand up to greet his customer with a unique warmth. Seeing his white hair fluttering and his forehead full of wrinkles, I figured he must be sixty years old.</p>
<p>His attentiveness and warmth made us familiar with each other.</p>
<p>Every day, on my way to and from school, I would glance into the shop. I saw his hunched silhouette, so engrossed in his work, as if his life, his joy, were bound up in the hemp thread and oiled paper.</p>
<p>(Going to school? So early!) He would smile, twisting his beard when he happened to look up and see me. He was often so diligent that he forgot his fatigue, working from early morning until late in the evening without rest.</p>
<p>(Where do you study? It's a pity my A-Yun didn't have the good fortune. She's very clever and knows a few characters too…)</p>
<p>(Dad, aren't you ashamed, always bragging like that.) A-Yun blushed. A pretty figure, tall, with a slightly dark complexion, and bright pupils that seemed to capture one's soul, she was a quiet young woman.</p>
<p>(A-Yun's mother died six or seven years ago. That's our hard luck. Fortunately, the neighbors are good and treat us like family, otherwise, it would be too lonely.)</p>
<p>(Shopkeeper, how's business?)</p>
<p>(It's uncertain. Business is good when it rains, but it's common for no one to come for ten days or half a month.)</p>
<p>(You repair them well; your craftsmanship is really good. I'll spread the word and tell people to come to you.) I examined the repaired umbrella. He was so capable that he fixed it like new.</p>
<p>(Oh, no, if there are too many, I won't be able to fix them in time, and failing to deliver on time is a bad thing.) He frowned and said, (Ah, if A-Yun's mother were alive, she was very good at repairing them. You never saw that good woman; I can't forget her kindness even for a day…)</p>
<p>(What is it, Dad? Don't mention those sad things again. Mom is dead; are you sure she's okay with you being this upset?) I looked at her face, deeply saddened. A small black mole on her forehead made her even more charming. Two crystal tears were in her eyes.</p>
<p>(That's true, money and people are gone. Fortunately, A-Yun is older now. A-Yun can help you do some work, right?)</p>
<p>(She can't do that forever. She's eighteen years old now, it's about time…) A-Yun ran over to cover her father's mouth. It was summer, and a pink plaid short jacket made her even more beautiful.</p>
<p>Today, as I walked past with my schoolbag, I was stunned to see a white curtain hanging in front of the shop. I remembered the umbrella I had just taken there the day before, and I stepped into the shop.</p>
<p>A-Yun came out of the mourning hall wearing mourning clothes, her eyes swollen like lychees, her hair like a pile of messy firewood.</p>
<p>(What happened? Who?) Actually, besides her father, who else could it be?</p>
<p>(Dad said he wasn't feeling well a couple of days ago, but I didn't pay attention. Who knew that yesterday he vomited and had diarrhea, and he passed away at noon today,) she sobbed, (Heaven, how can I go on?)</p>
<p>I couldn't find a word to comfort her. This seemed to be A-Yun's inevitable fate.</p>
<p>A-Yun looked at me forlornly as I walked out, her eyes red. I forgot about the umbrella.</p>
<h3 id="e194">Watermelon Seeds and the Chinese Nation <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Wen Juan</p>
<p>It is said that when a certain Chinese actor was performing in the United States, on the first day, there were indeed many American audience members. However, the impression of the watermelon seed shells scattered all over the floor by the Chinese audience members sitting with them frightened them. So, on the second day, only watermelon seed shells and the Chinese people who created those watermelon seed shells remained in the theater; there were no American audience members to be seen.</p>
<p>Alas! The power of watermelon seeds is so great and far-reaching! This is already the case in faraway foreign countries, let alone within our own country! We don't need to mention anything else; just take Shanghai as an example. From wealthy people living in Western-style houses to the so-called (peddlers and laborers), almost every family has traces of watermelon seeds every day. Guests at banquets need watermelon seeds, and even people chatting idly at the door of small houses have watermelon seeds in their hands. I often think: if someone were to calculate the total amount of watermelon seeds consumed in China every day and the amount of time wasted by watermelon seeds, they would certainly obtain an astonishing number!</p>
<p>Looking at the nationwide addiction to eating watermelon seeds, we can see how many idle and unemployed people there are in China! Because the greatest purpose of eating watermelon seeds is to kill time and relieve boredom. Not only during ordinary times but even in the most intense meeting rooms and movie theaters, we Chinese are still bored and idle, and watermelon seeds are still needed to drive away loneliness. Therefore, it seems that an inseparable relationship has been established between the Chinese people and watermelon seeds.</p>
<p>Moreover, the appearance of watermelon seeds can symbolize the demeanor of our great Chinese people. The Chinese people's disorganization and lack of unity, the strong individualistic tendencies, the antagonism and infighting within individual China, the willingness to be defeated by foreigners one by one rather than compromise with each other—are these not exactly the same as the watermelon seeds we eat every day?</p>

<p>— Zi Zhan</p>
<p>(Twenty-three) National Martial Arts and Foreign Aggression</p>
<p>During the late Qing Dynasty, when governance was lost and foreign troubles deepened, after experiencing much hardship and suffering many insults, the idea of using spiritual boxing to resist foreign aggression arose. This was the origin of the Boxer Rebellion. Since the Japanese invaders came, everyone has been clamoring for resistance. Airplanes and cannons are far inferior to the enemy; but using broadswords can occasionally achieve miraculous results, which the Chinese people greatly exaggerate. Recently, Han Fuju, Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, specifically decided to hold a provincial national martial arts examination starting on May 14th to seek out talents with extraordinary abilities in flying, roaring, running, leaping, and acupressure. He will provide equipment, prepare prizes, and treat them with the respect due to honored guests. Moreover, he does not limit applicants by province or qualifications; anyone can come to demonstrate their skills. (See this newspaper's issue from the 20th of last month.) When foreign aggression awaits resistance, national martial arts will flourish. Historical books are full of examples of this. The History of the Han Dynasty, Biography of Wang Mang, says that in the sixth year of the Beginning Founding, Wang Mang widely recruited people with extraordinary skills who could attack the Xiongnu, intending to give them unprecedented positions. Tens of thousands of people claimed to have useful skills. Some said they could cross water without boats or rafts, linking horses and riders to transport a million troops. Some said they could go without grain or food, taking medicine so that the entire army would not be hungry. Some said they could fly a thousand miles a day, spying on the Xiongnu. Wang Mang tested them all, taking large crows and attaching two wings to them, covering their heads and bodies with feathers, and attaching rings and buttons. They flew several hundred steps and fell down. Wang Mang knew they were unusable, but he still wanted to enhance their reputation, so he made them military commanders and awarded them carriages and horses. It can be seen that when the country was in crisis during Wang Mang's time, he wanted to use airplanes to spy on the enemy, and already had the idea of aerial warfare. It is a pity that this national martial art has been lost and could not be carried forward. Otherwise, as of today, there would be domestic aircraft to resist the Japanese invaders. The History of the Song Dynasty, Biography of Sun Fu, says that when the Jin people surrounded the capital, Fu personally defended the city day and night. Reading the poem "Feeling Events" by Qiu Jun, which has the line "(Guo Jing deceived Liu Wuji)," Fu found Wuji among the common people in the market and found Jing among the Dragon Guard soldiers. Those who liked gossip said that Jing could perform the Six Jia Method, which could capture Jin generals alive and sweep away the rest. His method required seven thousand seven hundred and seventy-seven people. The imperial court deeply believed this and gave Jing an official position and tens of thousands of gold and silk. As the enemy's attacks became more urgent, Jing spoke and laughed calmly, saying: (Choosing a day to send out three hundred soldiers will bring peace.) There were also claims of Six Ding Warriors, Heavenly Pass Generals, and Big Dipper Divine Soldiers, all mostly created by Jing. Those with knowledge were worried. Jing said: (My masters will not come out unless it is extremely dangerous.) He was urged several times and changed the date again and again. Then, he opened the Xuanhua Gate and went out, ordering those guarding the city to come down and not to peep. He sat on the city tower with Zhang Shuye. The Jin soldiers divided into four wings and advanced with a roar. Jing's soldiers were defeated and retreated, falling into the Hugong River and filling it with corpses. The city gate was quickly closed. Jing hastily said to Shuye: (I must perform the method myself from below.) So, he went down the city and fled south with the crowd. That day, the Jin people ascended the city, and Emperor Qinzong went to the Jin commander's camp. It is a pity that Guo Jing fled, and the national martial arts lost its magic. Otherwise, if it had been passed down to the Boxers, they would have been able to achieve the great feat of supporting the Qing and destroying the foreign powers and would have long ago swallowed the three islands and dominated the five continents. Why would we need to wait for today's broadswords to resist Japan and national martial arts to save the country?</p>

<p>— Written by Jules Renard, Translated by Lin Qu</p>
<p>The Rifle (Continued)</p>
<p>Carrot Hair and his older brother Félix set off. They were wearing the same simple clothes they wore every day. They were somewhat disappointed because they didn’t have boots, but Lepic often told them that a real hunter looks down on boots. A real hunter's trousers are always dragging on his heels. He never rolls up his trouser legs. By walking like this in the mud and in the ploughed field, he naturally creates a pair of boots that reach up to his knees; such boots are strong, natural, and the maid at home would never dare to criticize them. (I don’t think you'll be coming back empty-handed,) said the older brother, Félix.</p>
<p>(I really hope I won’t,) replied Carrot Hair.</p>
<p>He felt awkward, and hated having the rifle butt resting on his shoulder.</p>
<p>(Hey!) said the older brother, Félix, (I'll let you carry the rifle all you want!)</p>
<p>(You're my brother,) said Carrot Hair.</p>
<p>When a flock of sparrows flew over, he stopped and gestured to his older brother, Félix, to stay still. The flock of sparrows flew from one fence to another. The two hunters, thinking that the sparrows were all asleep, bent over and approached silently. The sparrows didn't stay put, chirping and chattering as they flew away to another place. The two hunters stood up again, Félix frowning. Carrot Hair, although his heart was pounding, seemed to have more patience. He was afraid of the moment that would prove his cleverness.</p>
<p>What if he couldn't hit anything! Every delay made him feel relieved.</p>
<p>But this time, the sparrows seemed to be waiting for them.</p>
<p>(Don't shoot, you're standing too far away,) said the older brother, Félix.</p>
<p>(Do you think it's too far?) said Carrot Hair.</p>
<p>(Of course! Aiming like that will miss. We think we're aiming right, but it's actually very far off.)</p>
<p>So the older brother, Félix, stepped forward to prove his point. The sparrows, startled, flew away again.</p>
<p>But one remained, standing on a broken, swinging branch. It was wagging its tail and exposing its belly.</p>
<p>(I can really hit this sparrow, no mistake,) said Carrot Hair.</p>
<p>(Stand aside and let me see. Right, really, you've chosen well. Hurry up, lend me the rifle.)</p>
<p>So Carrot Hair was disarmed, his hands empty, yawning. The older brother, Félix, stood in front, replacing him, raising the rifle, aiming, and firing. The sparrow fell.</p>
<p>It was almost like a trick. Just now Carrot Hair had the rifle pressed against his chest. Suddenly, he had lost his rifle, but now it was back in his hands because his older brother, Félix, had returned the rifle to him, and then, playing the dog, had gone to pick up the sparrow and said: (You're still hesitating, hurry up.)</p>
<p>(Hurrying up might not be enough.)</p>
<p>(Okay, are you angry!)</p>
<p>(Do you want me to be happy?)</p>
<p>(But we hit the sparrow, so what are you arguing about? Think about it, we might not have been able to hit it at all.)</p>
<p>(Ah! If it were me::::)</p>
<p>(You or me, it's the same. I hit it today, you can hit it tomorrow.)</p>
<p>(Ah! Tomorrow.)</p>
<p>(I promise you.)</p>
<p>(Do I know? Last night, you promised me too.)</p>
<p>(I swear to you, are you satisfied?)</p>
<p>(Forget it!:: But if we find another sparrow right away; I can try this rifle.)</p>
<p>(No, it's too late now. Let's go back and let Mom fry the sparrow. I'll give you this sparrow. Stuff it in your pocket, you fool, let its beak stick out.)</p>
<p>The two hunters turned and went home. Sometimes they met a farmer who greeted them:</p>
<p>(Little rascals, at least you didn't kill that old sparrow, did you?)</p>
<p>Carrot Hair, flattered, forgot all his grievances. They ran home happily and triumphantly, without any resentment. Lepic, seeing them, exclaimed:</p>
<p>(What, Carrot Hair, you're still carrying the rifle! Have you been carrying it the whole time?)</p>
<p>(Almost the whole time,) Carrot Hair replied.</p>

<h3 id="e197">May First and the Chinese Labor Day by Luo Fu <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>(1) The Nature of May First</p>
<p>Eight hours of work, eight hours of education, eight hours of rest – the famous 3-8 system demand can be said to be the first manifestation of the power of laborers throughout the world after the emergence of the factory system.</p>
<p>Before the Industrial Revolution in the 18th century, human production activities were mainly agricultural, supplemented by family handicrafts connected to agriculture. The production of family handicrafts was isolated, without interaction. The purpose of production was mostly self-sufficiency. Therefore, production activities were highly localized. Handicraft workers could not gather together. With differing interests, there would naturally be no common demands, that is, there would be no labor movement like the modern one.</p>
<p>After the Industrial Revolution, advanced production techniques laid the foundation for the factory system. First, the commodities produced by factories attacked the original family handicrafts, causing their decline. Second, the emerging factories needed laborers. Thus, the relatively surplus population displaced from rural family handicrafts concentrated in the factory districts of cities, largely becoming laborers in the emerging industries. They came from rural areas with different environments and gathered in one factory, doing the same work and receiving the same treatment in the same air. Gradually, the same circumstances completely eliminated their original differences, and their character and consciousness gradually became consistent. Thus, when common interests arose, they would inevitably unite and take the same attitude, which was different from the period of family handicrafts. Those who could not unite before now had the possibility of labor movements.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the factory system, entrepreneurs, in order to expand their production scope as much as possible, naturally hoped that their invested capital would turn over faster and faster. The faster the capital turnover, the greater the profit, and the faster the reproduction, the greater the production scope could be expanded. Therefore, entrepreneurs tried every means to save costs as much as possible and increase output. Moreover, because the development of industry at that time was not as fast as the decline of the original family handicrafts, many declining family handicraft workers were rejected outside the factory gates. This gave entrepreneurs great convenience. They could arbitrarily choose their workers, use the lowest wages, and make them work the longest hours to increase their profits and expand their production scope.</p>
<p>Therefore, at the beginning of the emergence of capitalism, the improvement of production techniques instead led to the miserable fate of laborers. But at the same time, it also gave them an opportunity to unite, giving them the same intentions and the same demands. The historically famous May First labor movement was formed under such circumstances.</p>
<p>The May First labor movement can be said to be the initial result of the capitalist production method and the preliminary demand of world laborers. European and American customs and scholars divide labor issues into many branches, and most laborers often have the misconception that various issues can be resolved individually. In fact, the labor problem is the entire problem of the capitalist production method, and it is different from the conflict between masters and apprentices in the era of family handicrafts or guilds. Its solution must start from the whole. Working hours are not the labor problem, nor are they a part of the labor problem, but only one link in the whole labor problem. Because in what is produced by capitalism, workers do not produce for themselves, but only for wages, just as entrepreneurs produce for profit. In order to obtain greater profits, entrepreneurs must increase production. To increase production, one method is to extend working hours. This can avoid increasing costs and obtain greater profits. Therefore, the issue of working hours cannot be separated from the entire labor problem and demanded to be resolved separately.</p>
<p>(2) Research on the Eight-Hour Work System</p>
<p>The only demand of the May First labor movement was an eight-hour workday. The eight-hour workday, in a strict scientific sense, is not reasonable. According to the field research of Japanese doctor Ishihara Takatoshi, the results proved that an eight-hour workday is not an ideal and appropriate system. Dr. Ishihara studied the impact of working hours on the physiological health of female workers in different environments and climates. He found that even in the temperate East Asian countries, generally speaking, an eight-hour workday still has considerable damage to the health of workers (see the article "The Relationship between Working Hours and Climate" in the former Jiangwan Labor University Monthly). Now, many people already know that even if the health of workers is disregarded, working hours that are too long cannot increase productivity. Sometimes, they even reduce work efficiency. This situation has been adequately proven in places such as the Ford factory in the United States. Recently, the radical progress of Soviet industrial development has further confirmed this.</p>
<p>Before the revolution, the average daily working hours for workers in various parts of Russia were ten hours. In some places, it even exceeded fourteen to sixteen hours, just like in China. After the revolution, the Soviet government tried to shorten working hours as much as possible. The situation of gradual reduction of working hours from 1918 to 1926 is as follows:</p>
<p>1918: 8.5 hours per day</p>
<p>1922: 7.9 hours</p>
<p>1923: 7.8 hours</p>
<p>1924: 7.8 hours</p>
<p>1925: 7.6 hours</p>
<p>1926: 7.5 hours</p>
<p>According to reports, in 1927, the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union promulgated a decree for a seven-hour workday, which was eventually shortened to six hours per day. In the recent five years, many important industries have fully implemented the seven-hour workday. In 29 types of heavy industry and 12 types of light industry, the implementation rate has reached 82% to 92%, 90% in the timber industry, and 70% in the transportation industry. However, since the Soviet Union reduced working hours, labor productivity has increased rather than decreased. In many jobs where the seven-hour system is implemented, the average monthly productivity has increased by 8.2%, and the average daily and hourly productivity has increased by 2% to 11%. In the petroleum industry, the monthly labor productivity of each worker has increased by 13.7%, while production costs have decreased, wages have increased, and incidents of worker injury have also decreased.</p>
<p>However, in principle, working hours that are too long may not increase production efficiency. But if you want to shorten working hours and increase productivity at the same time, you must have excellent (production technology (as a prerequisite. Without good technology and a spirit of service ethics, it is impossible. The production relations in Soviet Russia are different, and they cannot be compared to workers who only work for wages psychologically. However, other places that implement a short-hour system can only be found in places with excellent production technology like the Ford factory in the United States, and this is for this reason.</p>
<p>Under today's production methods, entrepreneurs only operate for profit, and shortening working hours is a great contradiction. In order to compete with others for sales and increase personal profits, entrepreneurs naturally want the lower the production cost, the better, that is, the lower the wages, the better, and the longer the working hours, the better. Fortunately, there is an industrial reserve army, with many unemployed people. When workers reduce their work efficiency due to health damage, they can be replaced, and more laborers can be recruited. If overproduction is pressing and working hours have to be reduced, then wages can also be reduced according to the reduced time. Therefore, entrepreneurs are unwilling to have a legally mandated short-hour system. At successive Geneva World Labor Conferences, working hours have often been the subject of debate. No matter how entrepreneurs or their representatives say that working hours have been shortened, and no matter how many times there have been proposals, this issue has always remained an open question.</p>
<p>Therefore, the issue of working hours can only be resolved in the entire labor problem. The ultimate goal of the labor movement is the social liberation of laborers, not the resolution of partial problems. At that time, because the factory system had not been around for long, everyone did not see the drawbacks of capitalist production, but only felt that working hours were too long, so the demand for the May First Movement's 3-8 system was formed. Now that times have changed, our understanding of May First cannot be limited to the issue of working hours.</p>
<p>(3) The Demands of Chinese Laborers for May First</p>
<p>The occurrence of the Industrial Revolution and the rise of emerging industries are not consistent in various countries. The most significant difference is between advanced capitalist countries and colonies or semi-colonies. The industry of advanced capitalist countries is spontaneous, while (secondary colonies) countries such as China are not without the emergence of new industries like non-capitalist countries. However, it is not spontaneous but (externally imposed), that is, the occurrence of Chinese industry is caused by the import of industrial products from various countries (especially the import of machinery in the era of heavy industry), and its development is carried out under the aggression and control of industrial products from various countries. This dominates China's economic relations and determines the characteristics of China's labor problem.</p>
<p>Before the Opium War, China's economy was still in the period of rural family handicrafts. Agriculture was the main method of production, and family handicrafts could be relatively self-sufficient. However, after the surplus commodities of various countries invaded the Chinese countryside, because of their low prices and good quality, they were like mercury seeping into the ground, penetrating everywhere. The original Chinese family handicraft products naturally declined completely like fallen leaves swept away by the autumn wind when competing with them. The Chinese small farmers who could have been self-sufficient had to rely on the supply of imported commodities from various countries. Agriculture also declined due to a lack of capital. Thus, Chinese farmers had no choice but to escape from the countryside, like the farmers in England after the Industrial Revolution in the early 18th century, and sell their labor in the cities to maintain their survival.</p>
<p>However, when Chinese farmers fled to the cities and transformed into industrial laborers, their experiences were clearly different from those of farmers in England in the early 18th century in two aspects. First, at the beginning of the factory system in capitalist countries, although the population that emerging industries could accommodate was far below the population squeezed out of agriculture and family handicrafts, there were still many new markets that had not been opened up at that time, and colonial policies could also alleviate this relatively surplus population to a considerable extent. In China, agriculture and family handicrafts declined even more rapidly, while the development of industry no longer had the superior conditions of advanced capitalist countries. Moreover, due to the pressure of economic aggression from various countries, the development of national industry was extremely difficult. The farmers who fled from the countryside found it even more difficult to find employment.</p>
<p>This reason determines the complexity of the types and levels of Chinese laborers. The distribution of the Chinese population is not like that of capitalist countries, which is mainly differentiated into the most numerous industrial workers and a few capitalists. Instead, in addition to a small part who can enter factories and become industrial workers, most of the population either becomes unemployed, day laborers with no fixed jobs, bandits who take risks, and the basis of the army that is brave in internal wars but unable to resist external aggression, or they reduce their living standards to an unspeakable level and still remain in the countryside, waiting for the arrival of death.</p>
<p>Second, the core of the labor problem in advanced capitalist countries is the confrontation between workers and capitalists. In China, national capitalism cannot be fully developed, and there will not be large capitalists like Krupp, Rockefeller, Mitsui, and Mitsubishi who monopolize the national economy. Moreover, the tragic fate of various Chinese laborers is not only promoted by the aggression of capitalist countries, but also by the convenience of various countries to exploit Chinese raw materials and cheap labor. They have set up factories in China one after another. Generally speaking, most of the labor-capital relations in China are not the relationship between domestic laborers and domestic capitalists, but the relationship with foreign capitalists. In the heavy industry sector, 80% of all mining and manufacturing is in the hands of foreigners. Light industries such as textile mills and flour mills are also operated by foreigners. If there is a labor-capital conflict in China, then this conflict is bound to occur more often between Chinese workers and foreign capitalists. This is the characteristic of China's labor problem, that is, even for industrial laborers, the core of the problem is different from what occurs in capitalist countries. Therefore, the crux of China's labor problem lies in resisting economic aggression. This is true not only for Chinese industrial workers, but also for Chinese entrepreneurs in their infancy. The failure of their industries is due to the dumping of surplus commodities and the squeezing of economic power by capitalist countries. In this regard, their enthusiasm for resisting imperialism is the same as that of industrial workers.</p>
<p>Because Chinese laborers are of different types, their understanding and demands for May First are naturally different. However, there is one point on which they are common, as mentioned above, that is, resisting imperialist aggression. They know that all the tragic fates are caused by imperialist aggression. If there is no way to solve it, then there is no way to do anything. Therefore, the demand of Chinese laborers for May First is not only to demand their own liberation, but also to use their greatest strength to unite with the entire nation to seek liberation, resist foreign economic aggression, and seek industrial independence and self-sufficiency. Standing on the same front and not competing with each other and giving others an opportunity to take advantage of them, then China's industry will not be able to extricate itself, and the liberation of laborers will probably only become a mirage.</p>
<h3 id="e198">The Peasant in the Rural Economic Bankruptcy by He Bing <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>(1) The Process of Rural Economic Bankruptcy in China. Radek once pointed out that the increase in taxes and the invasion of commodities were the main reasons for the rural economic bankruptcy in China. The invasion of commodities is indeed a manifestation of imperialist aggression, and the increase in taxes is also indirectly promoted by imperialism. Directly and indirectly, the bankruptcy of the Chinese countryside is all affected by imperialism. Since the Opium War, China's indemnities and foreign debts have increased day by day. The final burden must be transferred to the peasants in the form of increased taxes. In order to compete for the Chinese market, the capitalist countries have all protected the warlords and used them as pawns. Conflicts of interest have increased civil wars. Therefore, according to investigations, China's taxes increased by 39.3% from the founding of the Republic to the 17th year of the Republic of China, and the continuous import of surplus commodities promoted the decline of rural handicrafts, making the lives of peasants lose their relative independence. Also, for the plunder of raw materials, the original crops have been changed. For example, in Shaanxi, which is known as ("the best land"), there is recently a saying ("cotton enters the pass, wheat goes up the mountain"). In the northeastern provinces, the acreage of tobacco cultivation is increasing day by day, and the peasants' self-sufficient plants such as rice and wheat are gradually being excluded. The prevalence of this kind of raw material planting makes it inevitable for Chinese small farmers to rely on the market, that is, their fate of survival is remotely manipulated by foreign big capitalists. For example, during the world economic panic in 1929, the number of northeastern small farmers who died among rotten soybeans was increasing every day.</p>
<p>(2) The Daily Life of Chinese Small Farmers. There are many levels of so-called peasants, from landlords who live on land rent to hired farmers who have no land to stand on. Their lives cannot be compared on the same day. Even for the common so-called self-cultivating farmers, semi-self-cultivating farmers, and tenant farmers, the levels are extremely complex. For example, the Academia Sinica's survey of Wuxi villages found no less than forty kinds of land ownership forms. The lives of farmers with different land ownership must be very different (the beginning of the study of Chinese agricultural economic research). However, in this group of peasants with complex levels, we still cannot find where their center of gravity lies. For example, according to the survey of the Land Committee of the Kuomintang Central Committee in the 16th year of the Republic of China, the number of Chinese farmers who cultivated and accumulated one to ten mu of land accounted for 44% of the population, but only occupied 6% of the land. Regardless of whether this number is credible, it is an undeniable fact that Chinese small farmers are dominant. As in the 1928 edition of the China Yearbook published by the Toa Dobunko, the distribution of land in China of 10 mu or less accounted for 42.3% of the total area, which is sufficient to prove the prevalence of Chinese small farmers. Moreover, this kind of small land is not concentrated in one place. There are often farm families with less than 10 mu, and their land is scattered in various places, sometimes as many as five or six pieces, each piece usually two or three li away (see the Outline of Rural Sociology).</p>
<p>Small farmers are poor farmers. The fragmentation and smallness of their cultivated land area have a history. Common people think that China's system of partitioning property is the culprit, but the main reason is the poverty of the peasants. According to various investigations, such as Wuhu, Yanshan, Chengdu, the suburbs of Beiping, and the four suburbs of Shanghai, where it is easier to engage in sideline businesses, most of the farmers are in debt. Some people use an income of 150 yuan per year as the lifeline of the farmers, but generally speaking, the income of each small farm family in various places rarely exceeds 150 yuan per year. In the past, remittances from farmers living abroad were barely enough to help in emergencies, but recently this source has been cut off, and the income from family handicrafts has long been eliminated. What the farmers have is only borrowing.</p>
<p>However, not all farmers are qualified to borrow. Whether it is private borrowing, pawning, or borrowing from cooperatives (only available in a few places), they must have collateral. The main collateral of farmers is land. But in this time of frequent natural disasters and man-made calamities, the farmers' loans are increasing day by day. For example, the Jiangsu Farmers Bank's loans are used by farmers less for production and more for repaying high-interest loans and buying food. Therefore, farmers' land is being confiscated because they are unable to repay their debts everywhere. According to Mr. Qiao Zuoming's survey of Kunshan, Nantong, and Suxian, the reduction of cultivated land area of farmers, taking 1905 as a base of 100%, had been reduced to 41% by 1924 (Kunshan has cultivated land), not to mention the disaster-stricken areas in various places. Land is the main means of production for farmers. It is also where life depends. If this is not guaranteed, the situation of daily life can be imagined. In terms of food, farmers in various places sell valuable agricultural products and keep the cheap ones for their own use (see the Rural Survey Report of Wuchang County). Even the diet varies with the season. Farmers in North China eat coarse grains in winter, and they do not consider other things. Farmers in various counties in Shaanxi and Shanxi often sell ("the food of the previous night") to pay taxes and rent. Their plight is indescribable.</p>
<p>Opium, red pills, and other drugs have recently become popular in rural areas in various provinces. The initiators are local military police ruffians, who monopolize the planting and profit from it, but the poverty of the farmers in various places is also the reason. In the places that the author has experienced, there are quite a few farmers who swallow opium and red pills. This is because the diet is not refined, the nutrition is insufficient, and the health is declining day by day. If they don't do this, they can't work. How can the farmers be willing to degenerate? If the diet is like this, other things can be known. According to various surveys, even in the so-called wealthy rural areas, such as the suburbs of Shanghai and Beiping, there are often more than 50% of farm families who have no clothing expenses every year, and other expenses are even less.</p>
<p>(3) The Phenomenon of the Deterioration of Peasant Life. The commonness and breadth of disasters in China can be said to be unparalleled in the world. For example, the drought in the Northwest in 1929, the flood in Central China in 1920, and the ("rich disaster") in the Southeast in 1932 (that is, a bumper harvest becomes a disaster, and counties in Jiangnan and Jiangbei all call it a rich disaster) all resulted in the loss of tens of millions of people and the submergence of countless agricultural products. It is also to be expected that people and animals eat each other and there is nothing left of grass and trees in the disaster area. Although disasters seem to be natural, they are actually man-made. Forests are felled, and water conservancy is not repaired for many years. These are the main reasons for the disasters, and the increasing poverty of small farmers and the exhaustion of agricultural production capital are also the causes of disasters. Analyzing the areas with the most disasters in recent decades, that is, the places where imperialist aggression is the most severe and the degree of impoverishment of peasants is the deepest (see the New Creation Agricultural Special Issue), it is not difficult to see the truth. Popularists advocate improving production as a means of improving rural areas, but the facts show that if the social system is not good, a bumper harvest can also become a disaster, so there is no need to improve production.</p>
<p>The lives of farmers in disaster areas are not worth discussing, and even in non-disaster areas, most rural areas are similar to disaster areas. In western Zhejiang, due to the decline of silkworm farming, there was also a human market last year. Husbands carry their wives, and fathers bring their daughters, wandering around and shouting, selling them by the catty, which is no different from the situation in the Northwest during the severe drought.</p>
<p>During the Yangzhou land tax turmoil, farmers destroyed the county town. The rice looting in Wuxi and the (eating the rich turmoil) of old women also caused disturbances for a long time. When the author went to Shengze, Wujiang last year, which has been known as (the hometown of ten thousand silks at sunrise) for hundreds of years, there was news of family suicides almost every day. Recently, the adoption of improved silkworm seeds in Zhejiang has also aroused peasant riots. Last year, farmers were unable to afford the one yuan for buying silkworm seeds, so they endured the spring and grew old in vain. Now the improved seeds are twice the price of the native seeds, and the full adoption is beyond the ability of the farmers. Regardless of whether there is any inside story, is it not reckless to think that this is improving the rural areas? Recently, there are quite a few people talking about (returning to the countryside), but the facts show that the claims of (idealists) are not difficult to prove to be a fantasy.</p>
<p>(4) Rural Bankruptcy and Labor Issues. China's peasant problem and labor problem are closely related and cannot be separated. It can also be said that today, it is better for us to pay more attention to the peasant problem than to the labor problem, because the bankruptcy of the rural economy is the key to the labor problem.</p>
<p>Due to the invasion of imperialist commodities, the extortion of exorbitant taxes and levies, and the frequent occurrence of man-made and natural disasters, peasants are uneasy in their occupations and have no way to live without fleeing. According to surveys in various places, the peasants, who were known to be as quiet as a dead swamp, have been moving so rapidly in recent years that they can be compared to raging waves. This is because they have no way to live without fleeing. Most of the farmers who leave the village in various places become laborers, and women become prostitutes. Otherwise, they either die in ditches or flow into the path of bandits and soldiers, which exacerbates the collapse of the rural economy.</p>
<p>However, the characteristic of China's economy is only that it is a colony or (secondary colony), that is, the industry is controlled by imperialists. Therefore, although the countryside is bankrupt, urban industry has not been able to develop proportionally. The emerging industries have not been able to absorb even one-tenth of the population that has crowded out of the countryside. If these people become bandits or soldiers, they can threaten the security of the city and destroy the prosperity of industry. If they are unemployed, they will increase the severity of the labor problem. The more unemployed there are, the more difficult it is for workers to find employment, the longer the working hours, and the shorter the wages must be.</p>
<p>From the perspective of industry, China is an industrially backward country and the tail end of commodity dumping by imperialist countries. So-called international trade is only to accommodate surplus commodities and contribute raw materials. If we want to develop China's industry, industrial products must only be sold domestically, and the only domestic market is the countryside. The peasants are so poor that they cannot buy, so if we want to prosper industry,</p>

<p>Yesterday, the interbank market conditions for long-term deposit interest rates were announced. The rate was 5 yuan, which seemed to be smaller than the market rate of the previous term (the end of October last year). However, the market is like this, so this type of deposit is very abundant.</p>
<h3 id="e201">Situation at the End of the Long Term <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was the end of April. According to regulations, everything had to be concluded yesterday. The long-term loans from Ningbo banks amounted to no less than two million, all of which were either collected, transferred, or newly made on that day, with all amounts clearly handed over. As for the amount of deposits and withdrawals in this street, it was also over thirty million. Because yesterday was Sunday, banks and markets, and Chinese businesses only had half a day of business, there was not enough time for a detailed investigation. It is estimated that it was also in the range of over ten million.</p>
<h3 id="e202">Foreign Exchange Amounts for April <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>In April, foreign exchange rates only opened a few points each day. At the loosest times, there were even days of free borrowing. As a result, the total daily amount was only 109 points, the same as the previous month, and not reaching the fixed market price of two yuan. The daily average was only about 3.6 points. It is generally expected that the interest rate regulation will remain at 2.95 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e203">The Stock Market Last Week, Amidst the Tug-of-War Between Bulls and Bears <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>Waves and fluctuations ultimately led to the dominance of the bulls.</p>
<p>Prices rose by several jiao to two yuan and two jiao and a half.</p>
<p>Last week, from April 24th to 29th, the bond market at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was relatively active and sensitive. Due to the impending deadline for April futures trading, there was a squeeze between short and long positions in the market, with considerable competition. The waves and fluctuations ultimately led to the dominance of the bulls. In terms of the situation, there were also signs of easing, with Japanese troops gradually withdrawing, and Tianjin and Beijing temporarily safe. However, the battle at Nantianmen was still fierce, and people could not help but feel uneasy. On Monday, the rise and fall were quite rapid, and the short squeeze was also strong. Among them, only the morning closing saw a slight pullback due to the expiration of long positions, with the rest all rising. The multi-day increase was as high as two yuan. Tuesday was the last day for April futures, with the struggle between long and short positions being particularly intense. Market prices rose and fell rapidly, resulting in a skewed result, with some rising by more than one yuan and others falling by five or six jiao. This was because both long and short positions were urgently seeking to settle, each going their own way, making it impossible to be aligned. On Wednesday, only May futures were traded. Coincidentally, the Japanese troops in Qinhuangdao and Luandong suddenly announced their withdrawal, and people's hearts were uplifted, and market prices rose by another yuan or so. On Thursday, June futures were added for auction, but they failed to open. After several days of rising, there was a slight reaction. Guangbang (Guangdong traders) sold heavily, and prices fell by about half a yuan. On Friday, the April futures settlement was handled and the market was closed. On Saturday, trading decreased sharply, and the market was slightly stagnant, with mixed ups and downs, and the numbers were quite small. In summary, the market price for the week rose by several jiao to two yuan and two jiao and a half compared to the previous week. Observing the entire week, the environment was good, causing a short squeeze, and the bulls benefited a lot. After the settlement, the market gradually became quieter. If there are no special changes in the situation, there may be a period of stable consolidation. The total transaction volume was 49,272,000 yuan, of which spot transactions were only 17,000 yuan. Futures accounted for a total of 19,300,000, with troop reduction accounting for over 7,700,000, the 1924 Customs Bonds accounting for over 8,700,000, the 2021 Customs Bonds accounting for over 9,810,000, and the troop reorganization bonds accounting for only 2,340,000. The rest ranged from tens of thousands to over two hundred thousand. The trading volume of June futures was very small, with a total of only 130,000, with only troop reorganization bonds and 1924 Customs Bonds providing a slight boost.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday's sources: Changbang Nos. 4 and 5 arrived, Sutongbang Nos. 13 and 14, Nangangbang No. 6, Songjiang No. 4, Qingjiao Sifeng Nos. 8 and 9, Xilian Tang Nos. 4 and 5, totaling over 40 boats. Demand in this street was slightly lax, and package purchases were slightly inferior. The initial market appeared tight, but the later market felt stagnant. Although Sutong粳 (Japonica) and Nanyang Xinghua帮 (gangs) were still active, the quantity was only two boats, totaling over 300 bags. Other Nangang rice was only sold in this street. Except for Sutongbang, which could still maintain its price, Nangang rice was already showing signs of softening by several points. As for the thin rice from Qingjiao, Songjiang, Sifeng, and Xilian, they all belonged to Beiyangbang, Tianjin, Tangshan, Yantai, Weihaiwei, and other customers who purchased over 2,000 bags. The initial opening prices were raised by several points to a jiao. Until the later market, there was not much difference. Only Xilian goods, because they were high-quality materials, had a special bright color in price. Looking at the later market, today's situation is likely to be bad. Duyangyang was short of goods and had a fragrant taste, and the market price increased. Changbang粳 and Bianyuan were more active, and prices were also higher by a jiao. Yinyuan only rose slightly by a few points.</p>

<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday's rice market on the river: Thirteen or fourteen boats of white 粳 were slow to move, and the market was tired and falling close to a chi. Early thin rice arrived in small quantities and sold well, and prices were also firm. Dujian arrived in small quantities and sold at a flat price, with no ups and downs. Yangjian continued to arrive, and retail sales were slightly active, and the market situation was slightly weak.埠客 (Wharf guests) set the price of the best rice.

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend remained weak. The Association’s board price for #24 coarse granulated white was 20.02 yuan, with slight transactions. Coarser grains were 20.015 yuan. Another 500 bags of miscellaneous goods were quoted at a price of 4.10 Dutch guilders, a slight decrease of 5 cents compared to the previous day. #20 medium granulated white was quoted at 19.80 yuan, and #89 Dutch red was quoted at 16 yuan, both lacking transactions. Only a batch of high-grade domestic sugar was opened, with a price of 15.55 yuan, down another 3-4 jiao compared to the previous day. Bulk ice sugar was sporadically opened at 16.80 yuan, with very few buyers.</p>

<h3 id="e211">Maintaining Property <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>Maintaining property, what kind of term is that? If you interpret it literally and think it refers to midwives waiting for childbirth, then you would be completely mistaken.</p>
<p>But look, in the occupation section of various forms, apart from filling in farmer, worker, merchant, soldier, politician, and academic, many people fill in the words "maintaining property". This refers to guarding the inheritance of one's ancestors, being the young master who never runs out of things to eat and use, which is also considered a very bright and upright occupation.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, in the mother's teachings of the Ming Dynasty's Wen clan, it says: (How can children and grandchildren rely solely on their ancestors to live? Heaven creates a person, and naturally provides for their food and clothing. If they are willing to take on various occupations, big and small, they will naturally achieve results. Nowadays, seeing the children of various families, with long sleeves and large shirts, eating and drinking in comfort, their parents love them and dare not mention labor. Even if their ancestors left millions in assets, they will inevitably be trapped in poverty!) Unexpectedly, the family precepts of a 17th-century old lady still hold true today. "Providing for one's food and clothing" is the inherent duty of everyone. Relying on one's ancestors to live is already shameful. What's more, to be arrogant and disregard everything, carrying the signboard of a young master, and claiming to be "maintaining property" in society, I'm afraid this kind of occupation is not very bright and upright.</p>
<p>What old Mrs. Wen said: (Long sleeves, big shirts, eating and drinking in comfort) is still the habit of 17th-century young masters. Nowadays, not counting rampant prostitution and gambling, smoking a few pipes of opium, marrying a few concubines, and being hawked by antique ghosts selling (fake Tiger Hill) antiques and dubious calligraphy and paintings are already considered stable members of the property-maintaining class. Others, unspeakable, unspeakable!</p>
<p>This kind of property-maintaining, in the 17th-century era, already had the danger of what old Mrs. Wen said: (Inevitably being trapped in poverty). (Because the way of today does not change the customs of today), can it be included only by the words (trapped in poverty)? Young masters, wake up.</p>
<p>(Note) Wen Huang of the Ming Dynasty, originally named Yi Jie, described his mother's education and wrote the book "Wen's Mother's Teachings". Only a few excerpts are found in Chengshi's compilation, and the complete book has not been seen.</p>
<h3 id="e212">Preface to (May First) <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Hua Ling</p>
<p>Today is (May First), also known as (Labor Day). This day is usually full of events, so I predict that tomorrow's newspapers will have several news items that are both ordinary and extraordinary. I (am good at observing the color of the sky and predicting good and bad fortune,) and now I write a few predictions below. Whether they are accurate or not, let's wait for tomorrow's breakdown. (The following is the main text of the prediction)</p>
<p>May 1, 1933, Moscow held a grand labor day memorial ceremony, followed by a parade with 100,000 participants. All Soviet Union countries stopped working to hold commemorations.</p>
<p>A special martial law in the city of Berlin, the Brownshirts mobilized the whole team, and suppressed the riot. Obstacles spread through the streets, so as to hinder the parade. At noon, a small squad of Communists gathered to protest in a certain place, throwing bricks and glass bottles into the windows of a certain building. The Brownshirts rushed to the news, and a conflict broke out, resulting in casualties on both sides. In the evening, there were still small conflicts in several places.</p>
<p>Italy is on high alert, the country is calm, and workers work as usual.</p>
<p>Although there are rallies in France, the emotions are indifferent.</p>
<p>The capital of Spain, Madrid, and all over the country, held enthusiastic celebrations, and there were small conflicts with the royal party in the evening. Three Catholic churches were destroyed.</p>
<p>London detectives were mobilized to strictly prevent demonstrations by unemployed workers and famine groups. However, apart from a few groups holding memorial meetings, the city was calm. The parliament discussed the issue of unemployment relief.</p>
<p>American veterans planned to gather in Washington to petition, but it did not happen. Workers across the country took a holiday, and the streets of various cities were full of drunkards.</p>
<p>There were disturbances everywhere in Japan, especially in Tokyo, where the military and police were very active. As a result, more than 170 people were arrested, and a professor and a celebrity were also arrested.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, reactionary elements planned to sabotage a certain construction project, but the conspiracy failed due to strict precautions. In the afternoon, in Nanjing Road and Xiaoshadu, there were several small groups of students and workers shouting reactionary slogans and distributing leaflets, and two suspected youths were arrested. Reactionary slogans were found on electric poles in the Xiahui Road area. The Chinese area was calm in the evening. Curfew was imposed early.</p>
<h3 id="e213">Women as Commodities <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Ju Er</p>
<p>Women are like a commodity. Before marriage, they are kept by their parents, and their bodies must not be tainted or damaged, so that those who ask for her in the future may enjoy it well. Once married, she belongs to her husband, who can toss her around, whip her, and drive her as he pleases. If he likes her, he can use her as a tool for sexual gratification. If he dislikes her, he can abandon her and treat her as dead stock. When she is widowed, respectable families consider her an ominous object and confine her to her room until she dies. Poor families treat her as unsold stock and hurriedly look for a buyer to sell her off cheaply.</p>
<p>A woman raised in a poor family in the countryside is like a gold ingot. When she grows up, the money from selling her body can be used for her younger brother's wedding expenses, for her parents' funeral expenses, or even to pay off debts.</p>
<p>A woman who marries a poor husband is like an ox with a ring through its nose, beaten to death, worked to death, starved to death... only to stop when she is buried.</p>
<p>A woman raised in a wealthy family in the city is like a darling, a money tree, and a pearl in the palm of her parents. To her elder brothers and sisters-in-law, she is like a thorn in their side, a money-losing commodity, and a burden outside the bamboo fence.</p>
<p>A woman who marries a wealthy husband is like a useless person who must ride in a carriage even to walk a few steps. She must call a servant even to take an object, relying on electric fans when it's hot and stoves when it's cold.</p>
<p>Alas, sisters! To treat a living person like dead stock is intolerable, utterly intolerable!</p>

<p>— Fei Tie</p>
<p>Sweet Springs glow with torchlight, boiling the waters of Sanggan. Northern geese arrive, inquiring about the past, delicate gauze restrains plum blossoms. Hear tell of thunderbolts flying mid-air, children laughing, saying heavenly flowers fall. Pointing to the imperial city tombs, barbarian horn cannot stir thoughts of return. First news of east wind, shaking the door, moving the window, bitterly casting off the wandering son. Distant longing urges onward, geese arrive but the person does not. Abandoning Zhuyai, strategic plans tacitly agreed, weigh the scales, cease labored calculations. Fearing dawdling, crossroads wandering, other thoughts arise. Deep, silent rests the harbor, drunken dance, revelry, yet easily startles from drowsy slumber. Machine grinding, relying on unstable ramparts, sweeping across wind and rain. Flesh confronts edge, pillow on spear, swallow tears. Requests for aid cut off, Jing Sha bustling at night, dried fish begging for a single drop from the West River, allowing courier carts to tail spin, in pained exhaustion. Welcoming the Big Dipper, guests, teaching each person to ascend the hall, what is being said in the Springs and Autumns, lies. The rise and fall carries responsibility, a widow from Lu, also casts off red and green silks. Now comes news, the shoulders and backs of Youyan, overlook the Qin cities, horses drinking dry the sources, nesting crows rise. Calling to heaven, no way, panicked battles and guards, deep ulcer, extending to the lungs, fearing the Yangtze River's natural barrier is difficult to rely on in the end. Heartbroken, not a visitor, night chants, should cry long songs, tears fill the paper.</p>

<p>Chapter 5: Brewing Tea to Pass the Long Night, Mourning the End of the Year, Raising High the Slogan of Resisting Tyranny</p>
<p>He laughed: I heard that he also has a daughter, why isn't she here? Zhao Ziqiang laughed: Our old brother here, can't forget women no matter what. Tian Qing said: Isn't life just the three major elements of clothing, food, and housing, and then women? Old man Zhao laughed and came out, saying: Company Commander Tian, what else are you not satisfied with? I heard that you have a good female student friend in the city, why are you talking about other women? Tian Qing laughed: Oh! Unbelievable, the old man can also say such jokes. Zhao Ziqiang took out his iron-cased watch to take a look, and laughed: Let's go into the city first, come back to my place for lunch later, it's only half a day's leave, don't spend it muddleheadedly. Tian Qing said: We just sat down, are we leaving? Yin Deren laughed: You are a bit insincere, clearly wanting to fly into the city, don't you want to leave right away? Everyone laughed and walked out the door, just in time for the long-distance bus, and it only took more than twenty minutes to enter Xizhimen. Zhao Ziqiang said: Brother Guan's house, is Xiao Tian going? I don't think you need to go, just send a message to your sister-in-law to say hello, that's enough. Tian Qing put his hand to his forehead and laughed: When you get to Brother Guan's place, don't joke around anymore, as soon as you mention him getting married, our Brother Guan will object. Going is a must, coming to the city specifically to pay New Year's greetings, how can there be no reason not to go? Zhao Ziqiang said: Joking is playing. I also want to say a fair word. Brother Guan is tired enough of wives and children, and his head hurts as soon as you bring it up. In fact, who can be like him, having such a large group of children? Tian Qing pulled on his coat hem and laughed: With our second brother's words, I am going to desperately attack the path of love again. The three of them were talking on the street when they heard a loud crash that echoed for a long time. Yin Deren tilted his head to listen and said: What's that? Such a loud noise. Zhao Ziqiang said: What don't you understand, it's the student lords shouting slogans again. As he spoke, he saw white paper fluttering in the air, and a dark crowd of heads crowded forward under the white light. Zhao Ziqiang pulled the two of them, retreated a few steps to the side of the street, letting this gust of wind pass. At the very front, there were twenty or thirty unarmed policemen, followed by three big students, one holding a megaphone, two holding large bamboo poles, with a white cloth stretched across both sides, with words as big as copper basins written on it: "Recover the Northeast! Down with the Japanese Consortium!" (58)</p>

<p>— Juan Yun</p>
<p>The weather is sunny, and all things are flourishing. The azure sky, the lush green leaves, and the vibrant flowers add infinite interest to people's lives.</p>
<p>Even with just a small plot, or even a few feet of empty space in front of the steps, planting some touching flowers is worthwhile. One doesn't need ("a pot of wine among the flowers, drinking alone with no one to share"). Just taking a stroll in front of the flowers in your spare time can bring a deep sense of enjoyment.</p>
<p>Since ancient times, beautiful women have especially cherished flowers as if they were their lives! It seems that flowers can evoke a great deal of empathy in women.</p>
<p>If you are preparing to improve a lonely and desolate home, now is the time. Quickly engage in home gardening work. Here are a few small research notes on gardening that can be used for reference:</p>
<p>Planting flowers and scattering seeds must follow a certain order. The soil should not be too dry, nor should it be too wet. If the weather is too dry, or if it hasn't rained for many days, remember to loosen the soil to allow it to absorb some moisture.</p>
<p>Seeds should be sown in rotation throughout the four seasons, so that beautiful flowers can be seen throughout the year.</p>
<h3 id="e219">American Women and Japanese Women <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Miao Shen</p>
<p>Some people say that women's rights are very developed in America. However, it is more accurate to say that American women receive special treatment in society. This is because American women do not have much equality in politics and economics (it can be said to be relative equality). However, in social situations, women receive special deference from men in general. For example, a husband treats his wife as if she were a deity. When going out together, the husband will help his wife put on her shoes, drape her coat over her shoulders, and open doors for her, while he follows behind. If his wife has something to carry, he will carry it for her. Wives generally consider this to be natural and show no gratitude. Therefore, some people say that American husbands are slaves.</p>
<p>The women with the lowest status in the world, and who also consider themselves to be the most inferior, are the Japanese. Japanese women are as docile as sheep. A husband's words are not only commands but are practically imperial decrees! No matter how bad a husband is, the wife should not criticize his shortcomings, as it would harm her virtue. The husband can beat and scold his wife at will. When the husband returns home, the wife must, as a matter of course, kneel to greet him. (Kneeling is the most respectful greeting in Japan.) Therefore, some people say that Japanese husbands are tyrants.</p>

<p>— Tian Fang</p>
<p>Good articles are often found in the opposite, so-called between the lines. If you look at it from the front, you are the number one fool. Those who know how to write articles will not do this, and those who know how to read articles will not be fooled.</p>
<p>Speaking of writing articles, we have no shortage of this kind of skilled technique. This skill becomes even more humorous when applied to actions, but few people understand it.</p>
<p>We can learn how to make soy sauce from the methods of brewing wine. Similarly, extremely vulgar and unbearable words can be hit from behind extremely glorious articles, because if you don't say it, I'm still a little unclear. Once you say it, I understand even better, the so-called (trying to cover up only makes things more conspicuous). Like blowing soap bubbles, the blower only sees its size, but the onlookers can easily see the emptiness inside, and the collapse is not far away. This is also a meaning of drawing inferences and can resolve stubbornness.</p>
<p>For example, if a corrupt merchant is caught here, everyone righteously rises up and says (execute him)! This is certainly a well-deserved death, but all the officials, gentry, ladies, and patrons who directly or indirectly created this corrupt merchant are all pardoned. However, the degree and quantity of evil done by these people are no less than that of the corrupt merchant. So, when one is executed, a second one rises. Underneath every corrupt merchant, there are countless similar corrupt merchants hidden.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as prominently reported in the newspapers, there was (saving the country with beautiful faces) and later (saving the country with dancing), with enthusiastic participation and emotional listeners, which was extremely popular for a time. So the reporter also kept writing (received so many love letters today), (so many tickets sold), and as a result, there were people carrying weapons and money to buy fried rice. A piece of mutton attracts all the mosquitoes and ants. Human's inferior nature, once it involves wealth and lust, cannot be concealed in the slightest. As a result, the titles of (patriotic woman) (national salvation dance queen) are highly elevated, but we cannot imagine what is underneath them?</p>
<p>Looking through the newspaper reports, there are also news such as big swords killing enemies, thirteen-year-old children joining the army, eighty-year-old men committing suicide out of concern for the country, and donating two military vehicles to the volunteer army, etc. These are all happy events, but where are our airplanes and cannons? Where are the military vehicles? What kind of situation is flashing behind these headlines! Please, readers, think carefully!</p>
<h3 id="e221">A Night of Luxury <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— Kuang Bei</p>
<p>About half a month ago, late one night, or perhaps in the early morning, suddenly a series of (pa-pa-pa) firecracker sounds came from outside, like a Japanese machine gun raining down during the January 28th Incident, and it happened to be in the same area—Baoshan Road XX Lane. This made me feel in my blurred sleep as if I was watching two scenes being shown simultaneously. Fortunately, the January 28th Incident had long passed, and many new, unconnected Western-style houses had been built on Baoshan Road. Although the Japanese machine guns were turning towards North China and firing rapidly, Shanghai could still sing a song of (universal peace).</p>
<p>The next morning, I got up and went outside the lane to make tea. On my way back, I noticed these big characters on the right-hand wall at the entrance of the lane: (XX Residence Celebrates a Happy Occasion - Enter Here). This suddenly reminded me of the firecracker sounds from last night. After all, they were for someone else, so I didn't have the leisure to investigate and see which number XX Residence was or to what extent they were celebrating their happiness. I just hurried back to my own residence.</p>
<p>During the day, the lane was still as quiet as usual, except for the morning toilet ritual around 7 or 8 o'clock and the noisy hustle of vegetable vendors around 9 or 10 o'clock. Besides that, there was no significant urgent news.</p>
<p>As dusk approached, a knock suddenly came from outside. After a moment, the sub-landlord came in to discuss with me: (The XX Residence at XX number is celebrating a happy occasion. They just sent two representatives to invite me to attend. May I ask if you will send a gift, sir?)</p>
<p>He kept repeating (It's a big shot!) (It's a big shot!) I didn't pay attention to anything else, but (big shot) (big shot) kept spinning in my mind.</p>
<p>After nightfall, the situation in the lane was completely different. Needless to say, the sounds of drums, shouts, and laughter blended into one, coming in waves. Even outside my window, there were frequent hurried footsteps. I couldn't resist walking out the door. Ah, I saw that at the end of the lane, people's heads were packed together like swaying wheat ears, and the brightly lit gasoline lamps emitted a dazzling white light. Ah, the happy occasion was there, but there was no way to squeeze in. I truly felt a sense of (impassable) resentment. I looked up at some of the windows on the left and right, and they were all packed with people, and I couldn't climb up anymore. (Good, one more!) Was it a magic trick, a Kunqu opera, or something else? I couldn't say for sure. Suddenly, four brand-new limousines with bright electric lights drove into the lane. Naturally, the four people sitting in them were celestial-like dancers with (jade legs and soft breasts). Sure enough, I heard a shout: (The dancing star has arrived!) This made me anxious, but being anxious was useless. I walked back, disappointed. Then the sub-landlord also walked back, disappointed, saying: (It was really beautiful to watch, but there were too many people, so I couldn't see it properly!)</p>
<p>The next day, I went out and made a special detour in front of the XX Residence. A bucket-sized gate lantern on the threshold was still emitting a gray-yellow light. The lane at the entrance was scattered with all kinds of paper scraps, fruit peels, and exploded firecracker debris. Unfortunately, the main door was tightly closed, and I had no way to see the luxurious interior. From then on, whenever I went in and out, I always made a detour around the XX Residence. Yes.</p>
