<p>五月爲我國多難之一月。如五三。五九。五卅重重疊疊。無莫非我創痛鉅深血涙糢糊的奇恥大辱之紀念日。而引領北顧。山河破碎。東北旣亡。平津又復岌岌。以往之國恥旣未曾湔雪。而當前則又外宼益急。國難益深。吾人念來日之大難。誠不勝其欲哭無涙之感。</p>
<p>我國自鴉片戰爭以來。即開外人覬觎之漸。以迄今前年九一八之變。百餘年來。我國無一日不在列强蹂躪宰割之下。度其殘喘。日本之對我侵略。迄今亦已六十餘年。吾人在此百餘年中所受之創痛。不可不謂爲旣深且鉅。國内先覺之士。力竭聲嘶。日夕奔走呼號以救國者。亦不可不謂爲勤且久。然而迄至今日。國難依然如故。抑且變本加厲。此其故究安在耶。吾人深思默念。不能不歸過於國人之散漫而無組織。</p>
<p>曷以言之。國家之組織。乃所以防止外族之侵凌。故國家第一要義。必須全體人民有堅强之組織。始足集羣力以抵抗外患。而觀於我國則如何。人民畢生之所努力。曾不出於家族範圍以外。國家利害。視若無覩。人民力量。僅及於一家。而家以上不與焉。人民旣無堅强之組織。自然散漫而不統一。故雖有四萬萬餘萬之衆。而其力量曾不出於一家一族之上。且不獨人民之散漫而無組織。也即號稱政治集團。實際上亦甚散漫而不能一致。一旦外患之來。其他能當。</p>
<p>然則今將如何而後可。是則有待於我人之覺醒。覺醒之道無他。即一改以往無組織之散漫狀態。而易以　組織之堅强集團而已。人民應如是。團體尤應如是。必盡去以往各自爲政各個孤立之狀態。易以同心協力整個之羣。夫然後可以維護我　　　　存吾人非不知外族之侵凌。亦爲吾國致弱之一因。然吾人應當先　　　　云，「多難興邦。」吾人苟肯下最大决心。盡改以往散漫不統一之　　　　以對外。則以往重重疊疊之國恥。安知非即我民族復興之助力。事在人爲吾人欲以已往百年之國恥。易取今後無窮之光明。則「多難興邦」一語。國人都應三思。</p>

<p>路透十一日日内瓦電德國國聯同志會報紙登載德外長牛賴特一文、内稱、各方對於軍縮問題、現意見扺觸、故妥協之希望不佳、德國不得已將完成其軍備、不問各國是否在英國計畫之範圍内限制或縮减軍備云、</p>
<p>國民十日日内瓦電討論實力問題之專家委員會、今日復開會議、形勢一時頗見緊張、因意大利及法國代表雙方發劇烈之舌戰也、所辯論之問題、爲各國半單隊式之組織、究應採取何種標準以計算其實力、蓋意大利之自十八歲至二十二歲男丁所組成之靑年軍、依意代表之計算、僅可當作正式軍隊三千人、而法國則堅稱其實力實値二萬四千人、後經專家投票表决、竟有七人贊成、五人反對、而通過法國之主張云、後法國代表復提出德國挺進隊及鋼盔團之軍事地位問題、波蘭及捷克二國堅持此等組織應認爲完全軍隊之組織、但德代表則極力反對其說、謂德國處於凡爾賽和約壓迫之下、此等組織實屬維持治安剷除共黨减經失業之所必需云、</p>

<p>大兵壓境的</p>
<p>沽源</p>
<p>本報特派員國安</p>
<p>（一）日光曬不透呵</p>
<p>我照例的坐着二騾車子、由六十三軍軍部出發、馮軍長還派了十名衛隊、護送我到沽源去、那是一個風沙肆虐的天氣、刮的任何人都頭昏眼迷、鼻子孔耳朶眼裏、都是細沙土、眉毛上都掛着一層灰塵、在這廣闊的高地上、因爲身上着了兩件毛綫衫、所以也就没有覺怎樣的寒冷、那騎在馬背上的弟兄們、都是老羊皮包裹着、頭上也都戴着毛葺葺的大帽子、但是天氣立刻要熱起來、他們也只得這樣的　着、有一個弟兄和我說了這樣的一句話、「不要緊、夏天穿皮衣服日光晒不透呵！怎能會熱呢、」</p>
<p>他們都是東北鄕間的好子弟、眞有家裏田地上五千畝的、但他們能有這種的犧牲精神、流血·挨餓·受凍·等等的惡勢力壓迫着、但是他們居然在敵軍的鐡蹄下掙扎出來了、我是如何的欽佩呵、</p>
<p>小車的輪盤碾着荒野的輪跡、衝着風沙的威力、在太陽要没落的時候、總算爬到了沽源縣城、灰色的兵又佈滿了在城中、城内的建築的張北縣差不多、現實的商店、一半死樣活氣的支撑着、那一半早就挾着「流水賬」逃了、進了城還是自己想法吧、牛羊馬的大車店、我們幾十個人就宿下了、硬土坑·破蓆頭·癟臭虫·我們很親熱的擁抱了一宿、第二天東方的太陽剛露紅、那些送我來的弟兄、果子·燒餅·（大餅油條）灰色的豆腐漿·我請客、他們都灌了個飽、臨走時又買了幾十包烟捲、每人揣了幾盒、都是很感激的表情、在那又黑又紅的東北人特有的臉上轉着、我一直看着他們矯健的身體、飛一樣的上了馬背、向那來的路上跑去了、新是我開始了訪問和視察的工作、</p>
<p>（二）上下一般粗的湯玉麟</p>
<p>自己在那土街上、躑躅了半天、肚子覺着發空、找了一個麵館、吃了一碗肉絲麵、又喝了一杯茶、這時已經有九點鐘了、問明白了湯軍的軍司令部、兩腿走了半天、總算尋到了目的地、軍部的房屋、在沽源的城裏還算整濟不錯、那些衛兵、乾瘦的臉上、都掛着一層士色似的灰、一張卡片投進去、等了半個鐘頭、一個少校副官把我領進去、那位上下一般粗的湯軍長還很容氣的迎出來、我申明了來意、他帶着皺紋的老臉上、立刻泛出一種「啞子吃黄連」的神氣、停了有兩分鐘、用那勉强興奮而低澀的喉音說着、</p>
<p>「熱河是在我指揮之下失守了、我眞有點愧對國内　約　　　他這時把眼球旋轉了一下）然而熱河複雜的情形、就單拿軍隊配備的不統一來講、是否决心對外、聰明人一看就明白了、（他語氣中是怨那拍拍屁股就走的張學良呵、）中央就是簡派大員、末調查熱河失守的眞相、我個人决計很坦白的聽着政府的處置、同時我一點都不辯别曲直和是非、（這時語氣是激昂而又若坦白者）我唯一的願望、由生到死爲中華民國的國民、决不能受敵人的利誘和威脅、（他臉上的顔色有些紅了、彷彿眞受良心上的責罰似的、）最後我相信我對得住國人的一點、就是在退豐寗時、日人還派代表說降、被我嚴詞拒絶、（說這句話時、頭向左右顧、好像要找一個證人似的、恐我不相信、）」</p>
<p>他說了這些似乎很懇节的話、我一邊筆記一邊看他那老臉上的表情、說完了的時候、還在嘴角上作了一個苦笑、不久該軍副軍長何遂、也來參加談話、他是一個精神閃爍的中等個子、我和他握了握手、同時他又問我關内的狀况、以及共匪的猖狂情形、最後他輕描淡寫似的說了幾句、「熱河不守的主要原因、就是因爲義軍方面、指揮不能統一、械彈補充又不方便、在防軍的立塲來講、指揮官没有决心、配備的不妥善、並不是敵人亡我、乃我們自己亡自己、現在察省的情形、又和熱河失守以前的狀况差不多、眞要不根本想辦法、免不了蹈熱河的覆轍、（最後兩句話說的非常堅决、我不覺毛髮爲之悚然、）（未完）</p>

<p>張垣特訊、雖然在報紙上、看到那些呌人半信半疑的電報、什麽多倫失守、官方没有接到報告等類的標題、但是事實終於比雄辯來的有力量、所以我就在「多倫失守的前後」通信裏、就老老實實的報告給遠在江南的讀者了、同時我很十二分的相信、廿九號那天、敵我攻守的戰事劇烈情形、也和守軍報告的電文一樣的眞實、但是我没有在那流血的戰壕裏無疑地又有些下意識地猜疑、然而問題終於結局了、三號那天上午十一點鐘的時候、我在由南京出發到張垣的第十後方醫院的門前、守候着由多倫負傷的忠勇弟兄四名的到來、這樣一來、我是多麽興呵四名負傷的同志、裏面有一位少尉排長、他是山西人、名字呌吳景泰、他是趙承綬骑兵第一軍·第二旅三團二連排長、他們第三團的陣地、正在多倫東南方向的乾泡子、距多倫四十幾里路、在這裏的陣綫、他們團是正面、左右和其他的團連絡着、這次他在左腿上穿了一個小洞、還不十分要緊、所以醫官給他換完藥、他就開始告述我二十九號那天的激戰經過、我很沈靜的聽着、彷彿在我們幾個人的面前、又展開了那幕黄沙流血的戰塲上的情景、</p>
<p>我們原駐大同一帶、第一軍一共是四個騎兵旅、這次奉北平軍委會的電令、選拔一·三·五·七·團餘外、還有一特務團、據我個人所知道的、守多倫就是我們五個騎兵團、戰線的長度、至少也有一百二十多里、我們三團到多倫、就奉命至乾泡子佈防、那個地方、是一些好地形也没有、沙土的高平地、陪襯着那無險可守的小土嶺、陣地構築的還算堅固、但是一開火就感到困難了、我們當騎兵的只能夠作長距離搜索、或是追擊、或是掩護主力部隊的退却、騎兵根本就不能單獨作戰、戰鬥力的脆弱、是誰都不能否認的·你想呌我們作工事、担任頑强的防禦任務、那簡直是緣木而求魚了、在乾泡子我們一團人、就是防守多倫的正面陣地、去了作總預備隊的兵力、不用說在第一線上的兵力就單薄了、何况一開火、每連還留下馬樁子（位馬的）、這樣一來、戰鬥兵越發的減少、但是我們旣然是中國的軍人、長官的命令、我們當軍人的只有絶對的服從、不管牠能行不能行、反正一腔子血倒出就完了、</p>
<p>二十七·二十八·兩天的早晨、距陣地前方三千多米達的地方、就發見了敵軍的威力偵察的小部隊、或是一排、至多也不過一連人、我們的團長、這時還在後方養病、當前發見了敵人、不用說我們是端平了槍桿準備着、後來敵人進至我們前哨陣地時、你想他們是威力偵察、當然一打就跑了、這樣小接觸很快的就過去了、到了二十九號那天上午九時、敵人大規模的攻擊開始了、但是空中並没有飛機、那天風乔的特别大、東半天都刮黄了、遍野的飛沙和風糾纏着、我們蹲在戰壕裏、差不多都呌沙土蒙上、兩眼望前看也看不了多遠、在前方游動哨兵、都在斷續的槍聲裏跑回來、敵人攻擊前衛約五百人、很快的在飛沙裏展開、這時已經要嚮午了、我們前哨陣地裏的守兵、當然受命退至本陣地、整個的陣地前方、只有敵逆軍和狂風在一起滚着、</p>
<p>這時我們全團都準備妥當、後面的馬樁子也看好、敵逆軍的攻擊主力部隊、在劉逆桂堂指揮之下、兩千多人都散開了、雙方都射擊開始、機關槍在敵人那面響的特别利害、我們左右翼的戰鬥偵探、據說也發見了敵人裝甲車、可是我們没看見、這次敵人的砲、並没怎樣的發揮威力、統是我們自己的大同胞、自巳戕害自已、說起來眞有些痛心、</p>
<p>敵逆軍的攻擊、在密集的輕砲、機槍火掩護下、前進的特别勇、但是我們也很沉着的抵抗着、敵人的第一隊挺進隊、都被我們的手炸彈所消滅、於是他們攻的有點躊躇了、在這樣的情况下、戰鬥的形勢、好像水波浪一樣、一起又一伏的、我們營長受團長的命令、由右翼出擊作佯攻、這時風越刮越大、槍聲和風聲攪成了一團、戰塲上的恐佈、又加上材料、</p>
<p>時間在槍聲砲火裏、一點點的邁進、昏黑的太陽、也慢慢的隱在遼遠的西方、敵軍發瘧疾似的攻一陣子又停一陣太陽没落了、我們的熱烈的情緒也冷了、我在下午記不淸幾點鐘的時侯、很遠地方來的一顆流彈、鑽穿了我的下腿、那麽就算結束了吧、命令催逼着在黑暗的漫野裏、勉强乘上了馬、隨着整個的退却部隊、别了多倫、向沽源的方向撤退、那留在最後的掩護隊只得犧牲吧、</p>
<p>一陣子退到多倫東北方向的三道溝、（距多四十里）我就被往後送、誰還管他怎麽樣呢、到了沽源、聽說我們的五個騎兵團、又位置在距多倫約百二十餘里地方的大梁底綫、那麽等着吧、養好了還能說不幹嗎、</p>

<p>貫通上松靑</p>
<p>三縣蒲滙塘河工告成</p>
<p>開浚蒲匯塘、爲本市一二八戰後最大河工、除松靑兩縣集有少數經費外、其大宗經費、由國民政府、淞滬戰區善後籌備委員會、補助之、共十三萬元、工程分爲上海·松江·靑浦·三叚·上海叚工程、係委託市工務局辦理、尙未完竣、松靑叚、則於昨已告成功、在滬西七寳舉行騐收典禮、茲紀其詳情如次、</p>
<p>沿革概况</p>
<p>蒲匯塘爲上松靑三縣主要水道、東起浦江、由日暉港入口、西接柳湖、爲江浙兩省轉運客貨之捷徑、沿塘居民、恃爲日常飲用農田灌漑者、不下數十萬人、前淸定五年一大浚、三年一小浚、由舊松江府主持其事、最近自宣統二年修浚後、已越二十四年、未加濬治、致河身垢污淤積、來往船隻、早不通行、祗有肇嘉浜一帶工廠所放含有毒質之污水、隨流西灌、色黑味臭、魚蝦絶跡、農人灌漑、旣無從取資、居民飲料、尤感艱困、出資遠購井水、其價綦昂、故一般中下階級受害之烈、尤不堪述、此次</p>
<p>浚治動機</p>
<p>發源於淞滬戰區善後籌備委員會宋主席、宋氏平日注重民生、嘗策騎微行、於直接間接各災區、徧詢疾苦、因親見蒲匯塘一帶之狀况、乃於閘北開挖鵝　浦·蘆涇浦·沈金港·西泗涇·隨塘河·城市河·外、又提議Ｉ</p>
<h3 id="c2">蒲匯塘開浚前之七寳鎭河床 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>

<p>昨日騐收</p>
<p>松靑兩叚時、到有松江縣長金體乾·靑浦縣長沈庸代表、及地方人士數百人、由張春鏞·胡筠莊·二常委相繼演說、略謂、丁茲國難期間、財維艱、幸宋部長熱心毅力、主張進行、以浚河爲救濟農村之要務、宋部長曾主辦永災委員會萬里長堤、本塘工程、不過佔其已往事業中千百分之一、但本塘地勢衝要、關係沿塘數十萬人之生命財産、其禍福利害、乃爲當地人民本身之所亨受、故望民衆體念興修之不易、以後隨時愛護、以埀永遠、末由地方代表答辭致謝、將建亭立碑、以誌銘感、旋全體攝影、盡歡而散、</p>

<p>國恥週演講</p>
<p>陶百川先生講二十一條</p>
<p>今天是靑年會第三次的國恥講演會，請兄弟來担任演講，他們舉行這演講會的意義，是爲的鼓舞民衆的愛國心，使民衆可以得到參考，所以兄弟雖則自問淺薄得很、也就大膽的答應了</p>
<p>我們要知道，日本的二十一條無理要求，到今天已有十八年，每年多有這樣一個紀念日。對於這二十一條，各位想都已知道了，因爲在書本上都可以看到，而且凡具有公民常識的，也都可以有相當的解釋。但如果要仔細的研究起來那末，普通的書上可以看到的那個二十一條，究竟是不是事實上的二十一條呢？在書上見到的二十一條，自一號至五號，究竟是日本提出的二十一條，還是袁世凱答應簽字的二十一條呢！諸位請想一想，如果這個二十一條是日本所提出的，那末袁世凱簽字的又是怎樣，若說這個二十一條是袁世凱簽字的，那末日本所提出的又是怎樣，不是成爲一個疑問嗎？本來這二十一條已成爲一種平常的紀念，但如果細細的研究一下、那就成爲不平常的事實了</p>
<p>二十一條無理要求，是在民國四年一月十八日由日本提出强迫中國承認的。此事的起始日在民國三年，歐洲大戰的時候，中國那時旣不加入同盟國，又不加入協約國，總以爲可以太平無事了，那知道日本久　野心，要侵略中國，一向恐世界各國或者有所干涉，因此不敢擅動，這回見歐洲大戰開始，明知各國無暇顧及遠東方面，認爲良機到了，但是無從啟釁，所以就借參戰爲名，一面通知中國，一面在膠濟路一帶與德國開戰了。自膠州以至濟南一帶，已是蹂躏不堪，中國心中當然不願，但是没有法想，祇得眼看日本和德國把自己的土地作戰塲。後來戰事停了，日軍依然不退。如果單爲同德國打仗，那末停戰後該就退兵，旣不肯退，顯然别有所圖。袁世凱看到這情形，簡直忍無可忍，就請求日本撤兵。日本借此爲由，勃然大怒，就提出二十一條，逼我國政府承認，二十一條的内容，是書上所有的，共分五號，兄弟今天且把牠再談一談。</p>
<p>二十一條的條文，第一號完全關於山東，共分四條。第一條要中國政府允諾日本政府，以後凡關於德國在山東依據條約或其他關係所享有的一切利權與種種利益、概須讓與日本，第二條中國政府須保存凡山東省内并沿海一帶土地及各島嶼，無論如何概不得讓與或租借給他國，第三條要允許日本建造由龍口或烟台接連膠濟路繳之鐡路，第四條要中政府爲外人居住貿易起見，允許將山東省内各主要城市，都趕速開爲商埠，其所應開的地方，另行協定。照以上這四條，差不多把山東一帶，都無條件地給了日本，所以那時的外交當局陸徴祥與曹汝霖二人，就答復說，第一條將來再說，二條未免覺得不安，因爲當初德國並没有說保留，保留不給他國是不錯，但是應爲自己而不該替日本保留，第三條關於築鐡路，向來爲築路而聘用外國工程師是有的，不過實權仍操在中國手中，現在由本日去築，不是完全變成日本鐡路嗎？第四是開商埠，這一條本來帝國主義者　有此種行爲，如領事裁判權等，因此陸徴祥就答應可以商量</p>
<p>第二號關於滿蒙各項，共分七條。（一）旅順大連租借限期，并南滿安奉兩鐡路限期，均延至九十九年。（二）日本臣民在南滿洲及東部内蒙古，爲蓋造商工業應用之房廠，或爲耕作，可獲得其需要土地之租借權，或所有權。（三）日本臣民得在南滿及内蒙古任便居住來往，并經營商工等項。（四）關於南滿及内蒙古各鑛開採權，許與日本臣民，至擬開採各鑛，另行商訂。（五）中國政府有兩點須要先得日本國同意，方可辦理：（甲）在南滿内蒙古允准他國人建造鐡路，向他國借欵之時；（乙）將南滿洲及東部内蒙古各項稅課作抵向他國借欵之時。（六）中政府在南滿及東部内蒙古，聘用政治財政軍事各顧問敎習，須先向日政府商議，（七）中國須將吉長鐡路營業事宜，委任日本政府，自本約劃押日起，以九十九年爲期。</p>
<p>第一號關於漢冶萍公司的，自十二條至十三條，都爲漢冶萍的利益。漢冶萍是一個最大的鐡廠，那是諸位所深知的。現在日本爲謀侵略起見，關於此項所訂的計有兩條。（一）兩締約國互相約定，將來有相當機會，將漢冶萍公司作爲兩國合辦事業，并須允如未經日本同意，所有該公司一切利權産業，中政府不得自行處分，亦不得使該公司任意處分。（二）中國須允所有屬於漢冶萍公司各鑛之附近鑛山，如未經該公司同意，一概不准其他人開採，并且凡一切其他措辦，無論直接間接，恐於該公司有影響者，必須先經該公司同意。</p>
<p>第四號第一條，凡中國沿岸港灣及島嶼，不得讓與或租借與他國，關於此條，在日本說是爲保全中國領土計，但是不惜與其他國家是對的，如果爲日本而保存，那眞是無理到極　了！</p>
<p>第五號的第一條，中國之中央政府，須聘有力之日本人爲政治財政軍事等項顧問。第二條，中國内地所設日本病院寺院學校等，概允其土地所有權。第三條，凡所有必要地方之警察，作爲中日兩國合辦，或在警官署聘用多數日本人，以資籌劃，改良中國警察機關。第四條，由日本採辦一定數量之軍械，或在中國設立中日合辦之軍械廠，聘用日本技師，并採用日本材料。第五條，接連武昌與九江南昌之鐡路，及南昌杭州間南昌潮州　之鐡路建造權，詐與日本國。第六條，福建省内籌備鐡路鑛山及整頓海口（船廠在内）如需外國資本時，須先向日本協議。第七條，日本在中國有宣傳宗敎之權。</p>
<p>日本提出二十一條後，牠還不准中國把這條約對外公布，不准有所修改。不准公布是因爲恐引起各國的反對，并且美國一定是不答應。至於不准修改這一點，陸徴祥當時本諸天良，也深望多少修改一下，因如此苛修實爲亘古所未有，那知日本不但不允，并且大發雷霆之怒。還有，此種交涉，竟不在外交署辦理，而却在公使的病榻前，如此奇恥，可謂已到極點！日本且知袁世凱正謀稱帝，故大加威脅，海陸軍並進，袁氏無奈，連日召集會議，終不得要領。</p>
<p>來中國雖不敢宣布，而日本得意忘形，未免洩漏。於是各國羣起責問，中國尙不敢說，是本却告知原委。惟有第五號却不宣布，因警權等與各國利害衝突太甚，所以後來袁氏簽字的二十一條，五號却不在内。</p>
<p>各國知道這消息之後，雖不直日本之所爲，但因這條約與他們無甚妨害之處，也就不管了。袁世凱則喪心病狂，也好似不忍完全答應，因明知現在果然爲帝夢所征服，而將來子孫仍難免作奴隸。後來日本在五七送最後通牒，限中國於二十四小時内答復、袁世凱數次討論，結果是屈服了。在五月九日下午六時，知照日本，大致謂我們爲維持東方和平起見，你們所提各項，予以承認，惟第五號，旣未公布，可否不在其内。日本那時也知不能獨吞，就答應把第五號取消，惟後文中須加「日後協商」四字，所以今天是承認的日子，簽字却在五月二十五日。</p>
<p>這個消息傳了出去以後，美國便知照中日，如以後違反美國機會均等，門戶，開放的原則，那他們是絶對不答應的。</p>
<p>現在書上的二十一條、是日本提出的，不是中國承認的，而中國所承認的是第一號關於山東方面的，共四條，第二號南滿方面的共七條，總計十一條，其餘十條，都用照會。所以從前中日關稅條約上訂得很好，都是關稅自主等等字樣，可是在中國給日本的，照會上却不同了。所以日貨棉布等物運華，關稅特輕，蓋爲中國曾送照會與日本，聲明日本得享特别利益。該照會於五月十五日期滿，所以南京某抗日會曾發宣言，說關稅條約已滿，以後不得再訂。但這是错了，因該條約没有期限，滿期的是照會而並不是條約，因此，袁氏所簽的，僅有十一條，其餘統在照會上斷送的。可是還有一樣比照會更壞的東西，那就是軍港不准給他國人的一條。日本勒令中政府發一命令，名義上說是鞏固國防，實際則爲日本而保存，結果九個照會一個命令把這二十一條，就無形的承認了。</p>
<p>承認以後，陸徴祥主張發表，曹汝霖主張不要發表，結果的確没有發表，因此日本又藉口說中國自存私心。後來到了巴黎和會，中國就乘此提出，旣然世界各國大家受到均等待遇，何以我國獨受到不平等的待遇，要求將此約取消。可是會長不答應，說這是你們兩國自已的事，可以自己交涉，不必在此討論。這次失望以後，一直到華盛頓會議，中國又提出要求世界公判。美國當時看了以後，也以爲太過了，就把中日所訂條約中之三點，就是第五號中之七條，也就是自上五條起至二十一條完全取消。但那時日本勢力，略覺孤單，所以這七條的取，消也是日本自願讓步的。還有關於東三省在所有的建築上，如有借欵須向日本借欵一點也改爲向新銀行團借欵了。這樣一來，美國覺得這條約與門戶開放，機會均等的原則無關，華也就置之不問。於是最後，中國只得要求盛頓會議的紀錄者，把此案保留日後再提的機會，這也可謂可憐之極了！</p>
<p>不久。旅順大連灣本來的二十五年租借期已滿，應當歸還中國，但是根據條約上則須九十九年，那時國會中的許多國議員，起來反對，說依法凡大總統簽字，未得國會同意，一概於國家法律不合，作爲無效，就去知照日本，結果被日本泠潮熱諷的駡一頓，至於取消與否，仍無眉目表示。所以那二十一條，法律上固然因無效而取消，在事實上却並没有取消，卽如五三案件，九一八，一二八，以至佔熱河山海關等，日本隨時引用二十一條爲口實，並且中國自己本身上，也處處屈服，仍然未廢此不平等條約。所以威而遜曾說，這是力量問題，絶對不是依賴任何國家可以成功。要談愛國或救國，須有力量，要有力量，須去準備十年，再來談雪恥問題。但是現在非特十年已過，而且已有十八年之久，僅不過每年紀念而已，並不曾把國恥洗雪。歷年的國恥更重，竟没法去免除他，這是最痛心的一點。深望全國民衆，大家團結起來，準備實力，與政府合作，以謀洗雪或恥，這也就是我們今天的一種　義。（徐雉筆記）</p>

<h3 id="c5">管子不應該打倒 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>— 醉痴生</p>
<p>在這社會不景氣，喊着「商業凋敝」的當兒。像「管子」這種人物，實在應該崇奉，不應該來打倒。</p>
<p>何以呢？因爲「管仲」是「娼妓」的發起人：女　三百，管　興齊。」這就是他在歷史上「創設妓院繁榮都市」的功績。遂使「娼妓」二字，延綿到今，世世弗替。不但紈袴子弟，富商大賈，要歌功頌德，緬懷先哲。就是曲院中的七十鳥元緒公，至今還敬之如神明，奉之爲祖師。足見他的功德，委實不可磨滅。不料現在一般新道　先生，居然掛　起「人道主義」的牌子，以有礙都市文明爲號召，竟提倡廢娼」視爲行政計劃之一。各處雷厲風行，首都的娼妓，當然不能例外，也皇皇如喪家之犬了。結果公娼雖禁，而私娼充斥。都市的文明，旣未見增進。都市的繁榮，反日形衰落。</p>
<p>於是商聯會諸君，急得跳了起來。以商界感着切膚之痛，紛紛開會討論，具呈市府，要求重行開娼，以維市面。一方面婦女協會，好像也感着切膚之痛，也請願市府，反對弛禁。公說公有理，婆說婆有理。這樣的相持不下，倒累得袞袞諸公，「左右做人難」了。但是依在下愚見，斟情酌理，還不如復娼。一則商界的痛苦，也應顧及。維持都市的繁榮，娼妓實有存在之必要。世界各大都會，如巴黎紐約東京等處，娼妓都異常活動，就是明證。二則有了娼妓，一部份的曠夫與急色兒，得着性的調劑，傷風敗俗之事，轉可以减少。三則在此女子職業，尙在萌芽之時。免得鶯鶯燕燕，徬徨無依。有此一種理由，所以希望政府不要把「管子的政見」打倒纔是。</p>
<h3 id="c6">流年不利古物 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>— 楊餘聲</p>
<p>中國是世界上少的古國，古國定多古物，所以提到中國古物，無論中外，不其然的使人發生一種艶羨的觀念。雖稅中國没出息的子孫，把它一批批送到歐美博物館去給西洋人長期展覺，且喜夏，商，周，秦，漢……十七八代的古物，一掘再掘的次第給發現出來，依然不失其爲古色盎然的古國，這是値得自豪的。</p>
<p>近數年來丨尤其是今年丨中國古物的流年，實在不利。歷祖歷宗傳下來的許多古物，捆的捆，綁的綁，運來運去，大遭「蒙塵」之難，倒也罷了。最可慨的是中國歷代帝王之都如河南洛陽陜西長安等處，東也掘，西也掘，外國人掘得不夠，中國人也來掘，河南彰德竟有兩千多農工，把古墓堂作衣食父母，而且居然藉此掙得三五十元至數百元不等的積蓄，而且居然還有辨别墓内有無寳物的本領。（見五月九日本報彰德通信）我們雖然不敢落伍到歎息現今的盜墓是决不至於砍頭，但從民生主義的立塲上講，老百姓要靠着「澤及枯骨」的手段，纔可掙得三五十元至數百元不等的積蓄，這是何等悽慘的現象！</p>
<p>我想起江浙一帶駡人最刻毒的話，常牽到對方十七八代的祖宗。想不到現在我們這些遠代子孫，竟有人會轉到他們十七八代祖家墳内古物的念頭，蘇州人打話「阿要氣數」！</p>
<h3 id="c7">新裝 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>— 百合</p>
<p>從高領變到低領，從低領再變到高領。從大腰身，大袖管，變到小腰身，小袖管，從小腰身，小袖管，再變到大腰身，大禮管。從長身筒變到短身筒，從短身筒再變到長身筒。女人對於衣服，三天二日，在長短高低大小裏翻來覆去，覆去翻來地變花樣，纔能顯出是不落伍的摩登女子。據說有一位新裝設計師，在箱子角裏發見了外婆太太的霞　，眉頭一皺，計上心來，截長補短，設計了一套一九三三年的春季新裝，大受女士們的歡迎。可知所謂新裝也者，也不過是如此這般的一個調調兒而已。</p>
<p>在下雖是初出茅廬的土老兒，旣未居留於紐约，也未漫游乎巴黎，怎裏配得上談新裝設計，不過運慧眼而察新裝大勢，在這不景氣的年頭兒，頗有傾於緊縮的趨勢。您瞧，腰兒窄窄，袖兒短短，裏襟兒缺如，貼邊兒不用，夾裏兒只裝半截，偷工減料，至於斯極。可知誰想出省料的花樣兒來，這新裝，在上海，至少當能風行三小時。</p>
<p>根據了這原理，在下也發明了一個旣新奇，又經濟的新裝。說起來，或許大家一見如故，就是三十年前，男子所穿的接衫式。譬如上章用紅花明星綢，下章用綠花摩登縐，穿着，柳條兒般在交際塲中扭，準會博得滿堂兒喝采。至於所需的衣料，隨你是三百磅的大胖子，只要二叚四尺零頭料，也儘夠了，豈不經濟。還有一種是套袴，也很可採用。因爲用套袴，不只經濟，而且是舒適伏貼，無美不臻。這些都是一九三四年式的新裝，摩登小姐，交際明星，我知必有採用者焉。</p>
<h3 id="c8">晨鐘的警惕 <a href="#c8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>天良是與生俱來的，無論智愚賢不肖，都有這麽些兒藴藏在腔兒裏面，即大憝元惡，有時也會一刹那的發現。由此可知天良是人人皆有，並不是怎樣希罕的一件事物，但社會的紛爭，利祿的薰染，一切的人欲，和固有的天良，處於敵對地位，人欲的迫擊砲，攻破了天良的防線，衝鋒陷陣，天良失其抵抗，一敗不可收拾罷了，那麽人們的爲非作歹，與其說人們的罪愆，不如直捷痛快的歸咎於社會萬惡，利祿萬惡。</p>
<p>暮鼓晨鐘，是佛寺中擊以報時的。但是暮鼓的沈着，不如晨鐘的淸越，天色欲署，羣息未動，除了風吹樹葉聲，禽鳥啁啾聲外，其餘一切的人籟，都是默默的没有些兒聲響，其時忽地聽到了一杵晨鐘，靈機觸發，淸澈異常，天良在腔兒裏躍躍欲出，所以杜工部有句詩，呌做：「欲覺聞晨鐘，令人發深省。」那是多麽確切啊！鄙人住在山海關路安順里一三八號，附近有幾個寺院，每日昩爽，正在一夢蘧蘧，辄爲鏜鏜鏜的幾杵鐘聲敲破，這時我戀著温衾，一切的一切，都會擁現到心頭眼底，彷彿親臨塞北的戰地，目覩健兒浴血，壯士捐軀，和倭宼拚個你死我活的狀况，這時我想到當此存亡危急之秋，旣没有輸財的實力，又没有殺敵的勇氣，還是天天談着風月閒情，詩酒雅趣，豈不成了隔江唱後庭花的商女麽，天良責備，毛骨悚然，一會兒又彷彿見着故世將近二十年的先大父錦庭公來，他老人家一變其慈靄之容，很嚴厲地責我　茸駑頓，二十年來，一無建白，弄得賣文苟活，志氣銷沉，我的一腔牢愁，正要向他老人家前哭訴，但一殺那又不見了。一會兒忽有許多朋好來舍，無非是催詢前次委託的事兒，可有什麽眉目，我覺得爲謀不忠，有負友誼，慚汗涔涔地，祇得向朋好拱手道歉。一會兒又………。</p>
<p>凡此種種，都是天良表演的幻劇，那麽鐘聲不啻是劇院中的音樂，音樂琤琤瑽瑽的先奏幾闋妙曲，然後戲劇繼着開場。</p>
<p>我深願鑄一具碩大無朋的鐘兒，在那晨間寥靜的空氣中震蕩着，使得那些漢奸，國賊，元惡大憝，以及僞君子，眞小人，寡廉鮮恥之徒，聽得了，作普遍的警惕，那才有效哩。</p>

<p>— 天恨生</p>
<p>楊老頭非常爲難，反問狗姑娘：「你敎我怎樣想法子呢？我是情願小牛不去，就把我代了他也情願，可是老了，他們不要我，這敎人怎麽辦？」</p>
<p>「姑媽不是也去想法子麽？嬸娘說的！」狗姑娘又一推楊老頭，臉上現出很着急的樣子。</p>
<p>「你嬸娘只說姑媽想法子去，不過是妄想罷了，那裏會眞有法子好想！」</p>
<p>「我想，」嬸娘有了主意：「我想，去求求委員，少抽一個，怕也可以罷？」</p>
<p>「誰」說有法子呢！委員的話也不錯，他免了一個，就好免第二個第三個，那末抽誰呢？」</p>
<p>楊老頭說罷，嘆了一口氣。</p>
<p>於是室中三個人都没有話，寂然了一會子。　　狗姑娘又不入心小牛了，姑起身來要回去。　　「這樣，等我到你姑媽家裏看看，可曾想到了什麽法子；你先回去罷！」楊老頭無可奈何地說。</p>
<p>狗姑娘一想，也只好如此，没有什麽可說的，就是這麽懷着一肚皮的悲哀怨憤和着急，悄然地走了！</p>
<p>楊老頭也跟着走出了門。其時已經黑下來，在平常時候，就不大有什麽聲息；這天却不然，四面八方都有悲慘的哭聲送進耳來。路上也是不絶地有人來往，並且都很急促，彼此見了，好似不相識一般，没有招呼的心緒；也有一路走一路哭着的，更令人酸鼻，把個恬靜的鄕村，變成城獄差不多了！</p>
<p>到了姑媽家中，阿貴妻果然在哭着，姑媽坐着發愁。問伊可想到什麽法子？伊只是摇頭。半響纔苦着臉說”</p>
<p>「我的頭都磕腫了！敎我怎樣呢！」</p>
<p>楊老頭不禁廢然！看阿貴的臉色，也果然若無其事，心裏就想質問。但一轉念：不這樣若無其事，又待如何呢？也就默默地回家了。半路上纔不期然意識到：「怕是阿貴的妻太蠻横，阿貴受盡了氣，所以情願抽了去，離開這個蠻女人罷？」</p>
<p>這一夜，楊老頭那裏睡得着，四面八方的哭聲，匯聚成一把利劍，直剌他的心窩。他想到打仗的可怕，女兒竟有做孤孀的可能，是怎麽得了！自家晚境的凄凉，還在其次呢！他就這樣在床上翻來覆去的熬過生平最難過的一夜。天纔亮，便趕忙起了身。不多一會，他就和哭腫了兩眼的女兒給小牛送行去了。</p>
<p>全村被抽的壯丁結成了一隊，像押着一羣牛羊似的，由村中出發，各人的家屬都是大哭地的隨後送行；押隊的人一路禁止哭送；可是又那裏禁止得住呢！在小牛走過楊老頭和狗姑娘之前，狗姑娘幾乎大哭而暈。楊老頭却非常詫異，他留心這一隊中，竟没有阿貴在内。</p>
<p>過了去，去遠了，各人的家屬也都散了。楊老頭把女兒挽送到家後，急忙去看狗姑娘的姑媽，都又見阿貴安然在家。問明原因，竟是連夜化費了五百塊錢，用二百塊錢買了個替身，三百塊錢運動委員，纔得把阿貴留下來。</p>
<p>楊老頭非常懊喪，怎麽不給小牛也買個替身呢！但轉念一想：倉卒之間，我那裏有五百塊錢；親家劉三爹也不見得好，替小牛娶親時，據說還是借的二百塊錢呢。這樣一想，也就不懊喪了。但接着又担心不要給女兒曉得了，</p>
<p>怨我有法子不給伊想，繼個不淸，那可又怎麽好？</p>

<p>第六回甜苦情場冷觀評兩面崎嶇世路密約訂三年</p>
<p>江氏道：唉！現在這年頭養姑娘總是擔心。說到親事，總是高不成，低不就。再說我們這丫頭，脾氣又大，還非得他同意不可！表哥路上有相當的人，給我們提一個。江氏坐在爐子邊，烤着火帶談心。桂枝盤了腿坐在坑上作活，臉子是緊綳綳的。似乎他聽了作媒的話，就要生氣倒並不是害臊。關耀武偷看了他一眼，索興說句話，試他一試，便問江氏道：像我們這樣的軍人，表妹也贊成嗎？桂枝突然將身子一扭，發着狠聲道：野蠻死了，軍人什麽好？關耀武笑道：軍人都是野蠻的，那也不見得吧？桂枝什麽話也没說，鼻子裏却哼了一聲。關耀武只當不知，坐談一會，也就走了，他心裏很明白，表妹是不屬意於趙連長的。他去後，江氏却不免向桂枝唧咕了幾句。一個自言自語的道：這樣人也不好，那樣人也不好，我瞧你去眺罷。哼　桂枝道：我自己的事，我自己知道你别管我，管我也是不行。江氏道：你那心眼裏的事情，我也知道。可是你自己也得細心去想想。我們和人家作街坊，人家還有些不願意呢，你送活到人家家裏去，不是讓人家轟出來了嗎？這個樣子，還打算談别的呢。這兩句說出來，却未免讓桂枝剌扎了芳心幾下。心裏想着，這實在是事實，有什麽公話可以去回駁母親呢。只得低了頭，忙着做針線，並不作聲。然而他心裏却在那裏轉着念頭，母親說的這些話，未嘗不對，像甘家那樣的人家，未必能容留我。可是甘積之果然是對我有心的話，可以和他哥哥離開；我們另外賃房子住，他哥哥不願意見我，我們不見面就是了。他如此想着，覺得有理，到了下午三四點鐘，知道是積之辦公回家來的時候，就在大門口站着等候。老遠的看到他，就迎了上前來問道：二爺新年好哇。（六七）</p>

<p>— 伯苻</p>
<p>以前在報上，常常看見店子裏的小學徒，或者良家的小孩子，三伍成羣，偷着要到峨眉山去學劍仙俠客，飛檐走壁。近來又看見報上說某省主席重金請這些飛檐走壁點穴飛劍的先生們出到塵市上來。在這兩者之間，其不相同之處，便是一個是去學，一個是請來學丨丨只是一來一去的區别。可是仔細想來，這一來一去的差别可就大了。</p>
<p>據說人類在進化的最初幾個階段，一切事物，都是以眼見爲憑，理論上的證明，是文化進步到較高的時代才有的事。所以用理論來證明夢境是假的，這要有相當敎育的人，才會相信。至於文化較低的人，你再說破嘴唇，他仍然以爲他親眼見過的夢境，是千眞萬確。那麽，他們並未見過飛檐走壁，點穴飛劍，何以又相信有這種人呢？這就是半生不熟的理智開的玩笑了。人類每天要見着若干的驚異。自然現象及麽術把戲都可以使親眼看着的低級人，信爲千眞萬確。而他們也有一點半生不熟的理解力，就從此推斷，旣然這些驚異都可以存在，當然飛檐走壁等人力以上的事也可存在，於是就相信深山大澤中，一定有這類的人了。於是對於這種不可理喻的迷信，唯一的辦法，只好設法敎他們看見並没有這回事。</p>
<p>小孩子們親自去求仙訪道，終於要覺悟的，可是，這只有他們自己知道，别人没有看見他們的結果，仍然繼續不繼地步他們的後塵。但是若果去請這類的人物來，人們就可以親眼看見是怎樣一個結果了。假如眞有這一類人。我們很可向近代科學，開一開玩笑；假如請不出來，藉此便可打破一般的不可理喻的迷信。</p>
<p>所以，此次某省的聘請，在事實的本身，我看並無可非議；問題乃在應用這個事實的精神。所謂一去一來間的大差别，也就是應用上的差别。若果聘請者的存心，眞如求仙訪道的小孩子們一樣，相信世界上確有這樣的人，那麽……中華民國萬歲！</p>
<h3 id="c12">「中國人與狗」 <a href="#c12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>— 達伍</p>
<p>早些年租界上的公園門口，曾貼有一張華文告白，大意是；中國人與狗不准進内。</p>
<p>那時讀書的中國人看見了，眞是「人生識字憂患始，」免不了感到侮辱，憤慨萬分。但憤慨雖是憤慨，中國人是最能「忍」的，若干年來，雖是與狗爲伍，也就泰然忍受過去了。　後來不知道是因爲革命告成呢，中國人已由奴才升做了主人的緣故呢，還是「歐風東漸」，中國人從外國人學會了一些人文主義，實騐哲學之類，在洋大人眼中看來已足夠脫離狗籍的緣故呢，總之，那大家引爲「遺憾」的告白，不知何時，忽然不見了。這事隨後也就被人忘却了，現今許多高等華人，胡服夷履，挽着摩登受人，甜密密的在租界的公園裏進進出出，是很少人想到從前那地方掛着「華人與犬不准入内」的告白的。　　然而中國人果然不論高下，一概脫離狗籍了嗎？這又似不盡然。舉一件小事作例：據說租界上是不許私自蓄狗的，要蓄狗，就得領照會，否則便被打死。雖然承洋大人的恩典，在租界上養一個人，并不要領照會，但一個人倘要進一步，謀生吃飯，做做手藝，却還得領照會，否則，也會和狗一樣被打死的。前兩天上海報上不是登着十五歲的理髮學徒，末捐照會，恐遭拘捕，「心慌急極，立足不住，致跌仆倒地，氣閉身死」的新聞嗎？這理髮學徒究竟是被人打死了呢，還是自家跌死了呢？這都無關宏旨；但因爲不領照會，和私自蓄養的「狗」一樣，給人追捕，却係是無疑的事實。</p>
<p>然則，在租界上，一部分中國人雖已脫離了狗籍，而另一部分中國人，像理髮學徒之類。還恐怕與狗爲伍的！嗚呼。「革命尙未成功，同胞仍須做狗」！</p>
<h3 id="c13">法國婦女與家政 <a href="#c13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>— 李萬居</p>
<p>没有踏進法蘭西的國土的人，或者到過巴黎不久而不明瞭法國社會内層的人，每每惑於花都之名，祗看見它的奢華的外表，便幻想甚至斷定法國大部份婦女都是貪吃懶做，好跳舞，好艶裝，過着窮奢極侈的浪漫生活。其實這種觀察和宣傳是非常錯誤非常武斷的。不錯，法國婦女有些在過着金迷紙醉的生活，然而這是少數中的少數，大部份婦女却早已覺悟到「摩登」婦女是要求女權伸張的，在可能的範圍内是應該謀經濟獨立的。她們知道生活之所以有價値，値得尊敬，就是在勞動和自立。她們知道工作不僅不是可恥的事情，而且是値得誇耀的事情。十九世紀著名社會主義者普魯東謂「道德的人即是勞動的人」，所以他說：「不願意工作的人，就不應該吃飯」；現代大部分法國婦女腦中差不多都有這種觀念。</p>
<p>歡戰爆發後，强壯的男子都上前線爲祖國爭光榮去了，乘下的祗是些老弱不能做事的人，因而當時法國的一切公共機關，如郵局，稅關，銀行以及商店，公司或工廠都落在婦女手裏，她們每天除出外工作之外，回家去還要處理家庭瑣事，同時並有許多女人冒着絶大的危險上前線看護傷兵。這便是歐戰時法國婦女對於她們祖國的貢獻！</p>
<p>在法國學術界佔有地位的婦女數量當然還不及男子的多。可是就我個人多年出入的巴黎大學來講，上課時，女學生們（這裏面當然有些外國女子）那種爭先恐後的情形，實在罕見。踏進圖書館一看，也是常常女生多於男生。而這些女學生裏面有許多人除掉每天到學校讀書之外，回家還要帮助母親治理家務的。</p>
<p>法國中産階級的家庭，通常都不雇用女傭，一切家務完全由主婦自己處理。這些主婦，出門時雖然妝得嬌滴滴的，但在家裏却像黑人一般工作着，把廚房洗得乾乾凈凈，把地板擦得滑滑亮亮，决不像中國女子，丈夫賺得五十元一月，便要請娘姨啦，奶奴啦，自己却飽食終日，「打打麻將」消遣。</p>
<p>寫到這裏我不禁想起十九世紀初葉法國的一位哲學家梅斯特爾（ＪＯＳＥＰＨＤＥＭＡＩＡＴＲＥ）來，他於一八○八年秋間寫過兩封信給他的女兒孔斯坦小姐，談論婦女敎育，他第一封信裏面說：「女人的功蹟是在處理家庭，使她們的丈夫幸福，安慰丈夫，鼓勵丈夫並敎育小孩…」。他第二封信裏又說：「……福爾德爾說婦女們能夠做男子所做的一切事情云云；這是奉承漂亮女人的話，不然就是蠢話。因爲事實恰恰與此相反。婦女們在任何方面終未曾做出什麽偉大的工作。………假如一個有敎養的姑娘，一個温柔，樸素和眞誠的姑娘，能夠使她養出來的小孩子像她那樣，這就是世界上偉大的工作……」。</p>
<p>梅斯特爾；這些話自然非常陳腐，非家偏激，不適於現代的潮流，可是處理家政是婦女的天職一層　　是誰也不能否認的。愛美是人類的天性，我們並不反對婦女們妝飾，但是我們却希望女子不要忘掉了她們的責任；我們以爲女權應當提高，女子敎育應當普及，但是我們却希望女子認識所謂「摩登化」是比前人更加進步，更加努力的意思；而不是僅僅妝飾和跳舞就配稱爲「摩登」的。</p>
<h3 id="c14">醫生 <a href="#c14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>— 侍桁</p>
<p>醫生，這種神聖的職務，在我的靑春裏，曾一度崇惑過我；所以當我將入大學選取課程時，我曾有决心要入醫科，雖然那並未曾實現。靑春的狂熱，是把理想的醫生，看成了救世主，並没有想到在這一切商業化的時代裏，它也是獲利的方法之一。</p>
<p>「醫生也要生活的呀！」止罗能夠在心裏返覆着這一句話，已經是靑春的幻想漸漸地熄滅，而與那醜惡的現實時常會面的時候了。</p>
<p>其次，醫生，這種神聖的救世主，不但漸漸失掉了他的光輝，而更對我顯示了最醜惡的面像。</p>
<p>中醫，雖然我從没有對他有過怎樣的信仰，但也不怎樣憎惡他，我第一次知道在中國的封建社會裏，是有着那麽可惡的醫生，彷彿是在看過了魯迅先生的「父親的病」後才得領悟的。魯迅先生在這裏給人類刻下了一幅中醫的繪圖，那繪圖，因爲作者的精心的藝術，因爲驚人的事件的本身，將便永久地存在人類的心裏吧！</p>
<p>西醫，緣於我的幾個害肺病的好友，使我和種種樣樣的醫生的面孔熟識了，那些面孔是使人不敢親熱的，一看見了他們，我便要想：「謝謝上帝呀，你給了我一個建康的身體！」</p>
<p>一個老朋友，大概是因爲遺傳，從九歲就害着嚴重的肺病，一到了緊急的時候，不管是在深夜，或在黎明，便去敲那醫生的門。醫生給他略加檢察，恐怖地遠離開他的喘息，隨便給開下幾種普通的藥，便悄悄地對他的親屬宣告了這個孩子的死刑。可是這個孩子，並不像醫生所判斷地死得那麽快，延續着斷續的喘息，總是能夠戰勝了危險又活了下來。</p>
<p>但這種活法不幸的，每是年的春秋兩季，總要蒙一塲大難，許久已經不再信賴的醫生，可是到了危急的深夜，仍要去敲那醫生的門；出了額外的醫費，醫生是會來的，但從他的獲得，只是那千篇一律的面孔厭惡的與死刑的宣告，有一次，他的病甚至把醫生嚇得露出這樣的面孔：「你這樣的病，還要跟我來麻煩麽！」於是什麽話也不講，拂手走開了！丨醫生原不是救主啊！</p>
<p>然而，無論怎樣，他仍是活在世上，最後，他甚至不更敲醫生的門，不再看那可惡的面孔了。無論怎樣地危急，他會爲他自己開方了，每當死裏逃生之後，他得意地對我們講：「久病成良醫呀！有這麽久的經騐，我將來可以不至死在醫生的手上了！」他今年已經廿六歲，雖然經過無數個醫生的無數次的死刑的宣佈，却還依然地活在世上。</p>
<p>另外還有一個朋友，也是害肺病，而終歸死在東京一家最有名的肺病專家的醫院裏，我看着他喘了他的最後的氣息，當時伴着那個死在轼國的孤魂的，只有我一個人。</p>
<p>有一年多他睡在那享有世界聲譽的日本獨一的肺病專家的醫院裏。那個醫學者，我不願提起他的名字，在他自己的醫院裏，儼然是一個小皇帝。他不大肯給病人看病，一切都敎給他手下的門徒，病人是成了這些門徒的試騐品了。（未完）</p>

<p>奥洛林丨呌我和另外一個女人纏在一塊，那是絶對不行的。</p>
<p>雷辟克家的丨這正是我剛才要說的話啦。那麽怎樣呢？老實說，你呌我怎樣辦呢？</p>
<p>奥洛林丨我們照現在這樣過下去，直到我死的時候爲止。</p>
<p>雷辟克家的丨你死的時候！你可曾想到這一層上面嗎，奥洛林？你也許會比我們一家子都活得久呢，丨這正是我所禱祝的，丨你竟以爲我想計到你死的時候嗎？</p>
<p>奥洛林丨你總不會因爲我偶然没有把一個酒杯揩乾凈，便想呌我滚蛋罷？除非你把我丢在門外，我是不肯離開你這裏的。並且一旦被趕出門外，我不是便非餓死不可嗎？</p>
<p>雷辟克家的丨誰說要你滚蛋呢，奥洛林？你看你臉都氣紅了。我們兩人狠親切地談着話，你却生氣起來，你說出這樣的蠢話。</p>
<p>奥洛林丨啊！這怪得我嗎？</p>
<p>雷辟克家的丨那麽又怪得我嗎？你的目力消失了，這旣不是你的過錯，也不是我的過錯。我希望醫生能夠把你醫好。這事是可能的。在你還没有醫好之前，我們兩人裏面那一個最困難呢？你甚至疑都不曾疑到你的眼睛已經有了毛病。而我們的家務却感着困難。我爲着避免發生什麽意外起見，所以給你一個好意的預告，並且我似乎也有權柄向你作一番温和的告誡啦。</p>
<p>奥洛林丨你儘量告誡我好了。請你不用客氣罷。我剛才覺得我已被趕了；現在你使我放了心。在我這方面，我以後會把碟子揩乾凈，我向你保證。</p>
<p>雷辟克家的丨難道我還要求别的？我不像外面傳說的那樣壞呢，奥洛林，除非萬不得已時，我不會把你辭退的。</p>
<p>奥洛林丨旣然這樣，那麽可以不說啦。我現在還覺得自己有用，假如你現在把我趕走，我會要呌說不平的。可是一旦我自己發見我已成爲贅物，我連燒一壺開水都不會了的時候，我自己便會卽刻滚蛋，不用别人來推我。</p>
<p>雷辟克家的丨你可不要忘記，奥洛林，那時你永遠可以在我們家裏得到一盆吃剩的肉湯。　　奥洛林丨不，用不着肉湯；祇要有點麵包就夠了。你看瑪易特媽媽自從單是吃麵包以來，她更活得有趣了。</p>
<p>雷辟克家的丨你可知道她至少也有一百歲了嗎？還有一事你知道嗎，奥洛林？我可以對你說，討飯的人全比我們幸福呢。</p>
<p>奥洛林丨旣然你自己這樣說，那麽我也像你一樣說罷。</p>

<p>新賣戶壓迫下之標紗</p>
<p>紗市因外棉均漲、晨間開盤頗爲平穩、惟仍有一部多頭了結、兼之某廠方套賣、所以逐盤下游、午後再聞客銷淸淡、致難振作、</p>
<p>人標逐盤下游</p>
<p>人標市塲人心多數觀於消費太少、新賣戶趁機壓迫、因而趨跌一元一角至二元四角、全日成交五萬四千包、查賣出恒大七百五十包、通記八百五十包、裕大九百包、穗隆八百五十包、明德一千九百五十包、立昶二千包、頤大一千五百五十包、大昌成一千三百五十包、泰昌一千一百包、益昶一千九百包、買進裕康一千七百五十包、賡豐一千三百包、泰興愼五百包、遠大一千六百五十包、同豐九百包、源德一千二百五十包、義康八百五十包、愼記一千五百包、仁豐一千九百五十包、收盤價如下、</p>

<p>絲茶蘇浙春蠶昨聞</p>
<p>（蘇鄕）近年來農民鑒於蠶繭歉收、蠶桑事業日趨退化、而滸墅關女子蠶桑學校及蘇州農校男女畢業生、今歲四出宣傳、並願擔任指導育蠶、更兼製種場林立、新製之改良種贬價兜售、故農民育蠶意興復濃、善人橋新村區已與蘇農校合作飼育春蠶、横涇木凟一帶蠶戶亦起購種孵育、種價大半記賬、今屆餇蟻頗暢、天氣良好、蠶蟻發育順利、早帮已二眠、晚帮亦頭眠開葉、最晚之帮、（即聞風繼起補育晚蠶者）尙祗收蟻、現狀甚爲優良、</p>
<p>（嵊縣）嵊南北農蠶因歷年蠶繭歉收、蠶本虧蝕、意興蕭條、今歲農村經濟益形窘迫、購種無資、一般飼育土種之早帮蠶蟻大半損失於寒雨之中、迨後天氣晴暖、四鄕桑樹發芽榮盛、故均借本購種孵育、以甘霖崇仁　界華堂等區爲最旺、晋溪浦口后山次之、收蟻頗齊、蠶蟻經過良好、早帮已三眠旺　、晚帮三眠起眠、再　旬餘、新繭均可　場、惜　行無人問訊、租出者寥若晨星、</p>
<p>新綠茶交易尙旺</p>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊茶市、遂安·温州·土莊等路之新綠茶、英商協和洋行進意續趨濃厚、怡和·錦隆·天裕·同孚·保昌等行、亦均繼起搜買、全市成交珍眉針眉兩項、共計八百九十一箱、交易頗形旺盛、現下多數行家、均有繼續搜辦趨勢、蓋皆鑒於茶價低廉、船期將屆、局勢與上星期又自不同、一般土莊廠家、昨日多有派員復行進山採辦毛茶、以便趕製售銷云、</p>
<p>糧食河下米銷滯價跌角許</p>
<p>（滬南）　昨日來源三四十號、去路零躉兩胃續滯、是以人心下游、都存觀望、因此作客寥寥、雖售方讓價脫售亦無人過問、故蘇同粳及南港米成交無幾、價格續跌角砠、至靑角泗涇松江西練等薄稻、包胃靑島天津等客雖續動辦、然數僅千包、且剔選嚴厲、都屬意高料、中關貨南洋帮心欲動辦、終以市價不附、遂作罷論、薄稻市遂步落角許、杜洋尖亦以胃呆續修角譜、變元乏貨無榮辱、陰元垂軟角餘耳、又申地市斛、昨經社會局監督在城内豫園萃秀堂較斛、將斛較就、較前用市斛加大、每斛六合半、由社會局通告一律遵用云、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路到船念五六號、市上走化呆而乏交、致市形短去一二角、薄稻零化亦滯、價小近尺、早稻短角外、杜尖小一角、羊尖疲數分、埠尖乏交、客尖帶疲、陰元乏貨、白元挺立之格、</p>
<p>客秈高貨缺乏</p>
<p>福州復起暢辦…成交三千包</p>
<p>客　存　兩多…市形乃看疲</p>
<p>昨日洋客秈市况、客貨又活、福州帮又復到市暢辦、共計成交湘　各米三千餘包、其他本客均無問津、客秈前日因閩帮停頓、市轉疲落之象、昨日再度暢辦、市又轉好、實因存到兩少、客團均限價扳守、故市消一旺、卽見起色、惟市上糙米與中次秈甚多、高貨缺乏、客帮歡迎高貨、高貨價挺三五分、糙米存多、次秈淸淡、仍見平軟、統市開出江西機晚四百包、價八元五角半至三角八分、湖南機油米一百零三包、價八元九角、又糙油四百三十包、價七元八角半至六角、又　靖四百包、價七元一角半、又糙靖一千三百包、價六元至六元五角三分、又紅糙六百包、價七元</p>
<p>洋米昨日本客去胃均淡、惟洋商與客囤均不肯輕脫、故市居墅站之局、全日由本街開出高小絞二百包、價七元六角、價與前市相似云、</p>
<p>不景氣的粉市</p>
<p>丨空拍居多丨</p>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤、各月份暫呈平穩之象、以洋麥報價、回好三四角、業内外人心稍形穩定、惟各路購買、均因金融及時局不佳、一致緊縮、遂致生氣甚少、毫無意興、各廠方面、亦因出檔不易、又均觀望、計開價似較好五厘、收價又復回平、迨至下午開盤、市氣停寂、爲開市以來之第一次、半日交易、祗三四萬包、如六十兩月均見空拍、市面之不景氣、已可想見、本月份因空頭稍補、形勢尙穩、餘則平平、結果本月份較好二厘半、六七十月份無比較、八九月份小二厘半云、</p>
<p>期麥微呈軟象</p>
<p>昨日期麥上午開盤後、各月份交易依然不暢、祗八九月份尙見活動、餘均未開、九月份因洋麥報價漲三四角、曾較好一二分、八月份則少上落、迨至下午開盤、交易仍不甚豐、市面則微呈軟象、七月份開四元二角九分、較昨無出入、九月份因有同行套賣、市卽見疲、較前日計跌二分、十月份開四元六角二分、較　一　價、計落三分云、</p>
<p>閘北貨</p>
<p>龍口粉尙看再跌</p>
<p>龍口線粉干、自客　跌後、銷路仍無起色、客帮僅温台帮稍有交易、本街辦亦不多、因此市勢愈形不振、而各行售盤極爲遷就、競相售出、竟較開價爲廉、並聞後批卽日可以績到、故市象尙有再跌之可能、</p>
<p>疋頭　白發嗶嘰及時旺銷</p>
<p>西服帮辦胃特健</p>
<p>夏貨呢羢、現正應時旺銷、公會上絡繹咸有開出、春銷之直貢·花呢·華特呢等、刻已無交易、對於熱天需用之白貨、昨西服帮進胃甚健、嗶嘰·直貢·花柳條嗶嘰·法藍絨·維也勅·羽紗呢·巴勒呢·及黄斜紋蔴膠布等、都有大數成交、做開盤價、如義記一一一一盜仙草白嗶嘰躉批每碼計五　凈盤、零剪酌加二三角不等、然查自己成本、則須四元九角四九云、</p>
<p>五金</p>
<p>軋缺多日之美白鐡昨日有到</p>
<p>自美匯放長後、美貨五金成本驟輕、故同業中人所到各貨莫不有利可圖、惟在前則因難於合算、所以訂購者極少、致目下進口亦有寥若晨星之概、如美白鐡前因貨少、行情騰漲、知四十八張估二十二元四角、三十八張二十五元五角、三十三張二十五元五角、二十五張二十五元二角、交易靑島天津長江各帮頗有點綴、市貨遂有靑黄不接、而二十五張花色竟至斷擋多日、致後購者有抱隅之嘆、昨日聞浦東公和祥棧到有現貨二三千擔、而市塲方面諒不致再有軋缺之憂也、其行情仍無更動云、</p>

<h3 id="c16">凡中國人都可寛心 <a href="#c16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>— 厚英</p>
<p>慨自日人侵略我國以來，於是救國之聲雀起，洋洋乎充耳幾滿，綜計前有抗日救國，跳舞救國，娱樂救國，後有香檳救國，玉容救國，以至最近之航空救國等等，幾乎可以上達雲霄，下通地獄，全國中一片救國聲，猗歟盛哉，然而睜目一觀，救國成功者，除了跳舞，電影，香檳……等帶着娱樂發財的性質以外，就絶少有完美的結果了。</p>
<p>大概是因爲倭宼又奪去了熱河，打破了長城的緣故吧，以致曾經産生過大聖人的禮義之邦，也不得不提倡「絶學救國」起來了，成敗固然可以不計，大名却早已流傳全國，從此「救國史」中，又多了一條紀載，堂而皇之，名正言順，可是以下走眼中看來，袞袞諸公，大可不必多費這一番心血了，其原因是我們中國雖然「日益危急」，而他們三島小國，却也「勢同覆巢」，請讀者不須心急，且看下面電文，</p>
<p>據本報二十九日東京通訊說，「本所深川一帶，在二年間沉下一尺，其他淺草·下谷·神田·日本橋·京橋麴町·本鄕等一帶，在最近二年間，也將沉下二米里或十五生的之事實意見，……而東京市内最低之土地，爲本所，深川二區，此二區比海面高二米突，其較爲高之日本橋京橋方面，約四五米突，但照經過之情形，已漸漸下沉，將來所有之建築，必至沉至海底而後已，目下東京人民，皆異常恐慌云，」阿彌陀佛！遥想不久的將來，我們可以看到日本倭奴在島上沉至水晶宫；那時，我們打着望遠鏡，坐着福特機，在空中拍手歡呼。較之現在亟亟預備飛機，以與日人一戰的，不啻有天壤之别；我們大家且預先跳舞慶賀，從此中國固如「泰山」！然而，倘若矮子肚裏疙𤺥多，在三島尙未沉至海之前，將人民財産都搬到中國來，那你又怎樣奈何他們？下走不敏，當代答道；「到了這時，抗日當然有方，錦囊妙計，都在一部「救國史」中？現在得樂且樂，毋庸憂急；下回自有分解！」</p>

<p>— 嗣元</p>
<p>一個不曾處身於社會的靑年，對將來總是抱着很大的奢望。幢憬未來的幸福，也許能增加現在生活的動力，導到着再接再厲的精神，去求實現後的快感。這在客觀環境平靜的時代，或許能夠滿足小部份的期望，目前的危機四起，個人的觀念太高，失意的苦惱也就更大。</p>
<p>全生命史的進程，必須建立預定的目標，才不致憾到人生的乏味，與形如意識的矛盾。在我們用心思去考慮一切，决定歸宿的時候，對未來的展望，現在的事實，自然須要從多方面去體騐和批判，得到正確的結論，再加上過去的經騐，來充實更深切的信頓。</p>
<p>鋼鐡一般的事實，呈現在目前了，宛整的國家，基礎在漸漸的動摇，社會發生着層層的病態。未來的結果，給我們走問何處的問题，立了一個高大的指路牌。我們今後不能徘徊，不能避免，要抖起全身的銳氣，去迎合目前的需要。在未踏上新的路線以前，過去的一切生活形態，有全盤淸算的必要。這不特可以堅定今後的毅力，而且可以使我們有反省的敎訓。</p>
<p>二十二年革命的成績，專制政體是廢掉了，民主的政府，有了一叚歷史，但還没有滿足一般人慾望的表現。本身的不良，是民衆應負的責任。政府，没有民衆作後盾，究竟非常空虚，更不能建設一切。要人們因爲民衆放棄責任，也就高居祿位，不肯刻苦的代人民努力作事了。</p>
<p>旣有的錯誤，形成目前的嚴重局面。民衆是一切力量的力量，他要監督政府，鼓勵政府。隨時注意世界的潮流，探索政府的錯誤，以便作民衆救亡的責任。袖手旁觀不預聞政治的態度，要根本肅淸，現在不是入山靜養，就可以了却一生的時代，國家到了危亡的階叚，靜養已成一種不可能的方法。</p>
<p>要人並不是高於一切的聖賢，他們也常有錯誤的行動。爲人民服務，是他們應守的職責。而主人翁確忘記了應有的身份，視之如高貴的賓客，直到禍逼眼前，才感覺已被利用。不愼於始，眞是十分危險。</p>
<p>誰都有家庭的連繫，誰都願家庭美滿，而中國人更富於這項觀念，好像一個人的一生，全爲了家庭而存在，想得到優裕的地位，豐富的收入，以求得父母的歡笑，達到全家生活的安適。國家，社會，同胞，不直接影響家庭的安全，似乎可以任其自然的發展。</p>
<p>幾千年傳染下來的惡毒，至今仍然保持着相當的勢力，所謂家庭，的確是重要的一個小集團，生命始終依賴他。可是，時代到了犧牲本身的幸福，來開拓全民族的生路，以救大衆的生存，是不能縮在小領域中享受安樂的時候！要保全整個的生命，要建設家庭未來的安定，只有棄絶目前的狹義範圍。因爲家庭本身，是經不起炸彈和大砲的衝毁的！</p>
<p>東北父老的遭遇，未嘗不會臨到我們的頭上，失去了一切自由，離散了妻室兒女，這樣生活下去，精神簡直等於死滅。家庭同受一樣的命運，整個社會的奔潰，家庭不能單獨存在，我們愛社會的生存，應比愛家庭還要加倍！</p>
<p>好些靑年花費大量的資本，走向自滅的道路，滑頭（塗滿可丹康）西裝，把自己裝成天仙般的美麗，究竟爲了什麽？覺得漂亮的高貴嗎？只要有一點社會常識的人，就覺得這種意識的卑鄙，茫茫人海，有的是比你更闊的男子，更美麗的少女，也就没有什麽漂亮的高貴。生活舒適嗎？只要神經還没有麻木，閉着眼晴想想現在的種種景况，災荒，飢寒，形成社會的破産現象。你不能離開社會而存在，社會的病態，要永遠影響</p>

<p>醇酒女人，洋房汽車，皆足以消沉自己的意志，我也曾想到升官發财，享樂人生，而現實明白告訴作這些美夢的人們，粗暴的巨手，已在國家的頭上施行打擊。苦痛要降到每個人的周遭，此刻是需要刻苦鬥爭，從艱難困苦的狀態中開拓民族生存的時候！</p>

<h3 id="c20">一張特别的告白 <a href="#c20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>— 愼敏</p>
<p>在下前天走過南市薛家浜附近。在一條小弄口牆壁上。瞧見一張特别的告白。吾不覺好奇心動。站定了脚。費了一分鐘的時間。從頭至尾。讀了一遍。因其别字連篇。又把這張告白的字句抄了下來，投寄本刊。以作義務的宣傳。這張告白的中間，寫着專作火丹四個大字。兩旁的小字。别字很我。不文的吾。竟讀不下去了。茲將原文一字不改照抄如下。</p>
<p>本醫生專作老火丹脚。淸里黄玄。吉毒。夏甘。小長氣。黄種。水果。氣果。廉作牙蟲。眼鮮。小兒唐郎子。赤油風。急曼警風。即骨入介。包念心經高皇經。代做暈素佛事。假星拜斗。一應具全。定價面議。如有合意者。請到夾壁弄内問紫阿元即協。特此告白。</p>

<h3 id="c21">大衣 <a href="#c21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>— 顔也</p>
<p>大衣，在今日都市中的女子，已把牠當作一件不可缺少的服裝了。除掉炎熱之夏，春光裏，秋氣中，以及朔風呼號時，都用得着牠。冬日嚴寒，道途奔走，非此不足以禦寒。入室較暖，則任意去之：穿上脫下，都很便利。春秋乍寒乍暖，亦非此不可隨時增減適體。然其最大的作用却别有所在，就是出入交際塲，若無大衣，則蜷髮長眉紅唇粉頰，也將爲之减色。有之，則益足增其嫵媚，示其闊绰。大衣之爲用大矣哉！</p>
<p>昨天有友人討老婆，我和我的鄰居某女士都被邀去參加盛典。下午二時，我去約她偕行。她說：先生！我不去了，請爲我向主人致不克登堂祝賀之歉意。我說：你與主人，交非泛泛，怎可不往參加呢？旣而她喟然道：一件春季大衣還没有製就，呌我怎能到大庭廣衆中去呢？冬季大衣又已過時，非不願去，不能去也。我堅勸不獲，乃踽踽獨往。</p>
<p>到得那裏，在許多女賓中，果然見大家都在薄薄的春衫外加上一件大衣，祇有老婆婆和童年姑娘們不穿。這時我對於隔壁女士之不來參加友人婚禮，才原諒她不能來的苦衷。後來幣眼看見一位蜷髮革履穿了不稱身的大衣而舉措還有些不自然的小姐，似曾相識，閉目一想，她原來是阿巧。她一個十五六歲的小姑娘，天天在家帮同父母做豆腐買賣，空下來淘米洗菜倒馬桶，都是她的工作。粗頭粗脚，照她的資格，蜷髮革履已覺過分，大衣是更没福消受的了。然而她今天到這大庭廣衆中來，在許多花枝招展的同性裏周旋，居然穿起今日都市中女子所不可缺少的大衣，顧盼自豪，除掉他的舉動欠自然外，誰能知道她是一個「蓬門未識綺羅香」的姑娘。以阿巧也穿起大衣來，隔壁女士之不來麥加這婚禮，我當更加原諒她了。</p>
<p>三四年前上海有一個敎育界的集團，　　　　　有。第一次大會，到者三四百人中，女的八九十人，穿大衣的祇有一個足愧鬆眉而常做主席的某女士。地站在臺上，一手挿在袋中，一手一起一落，態度眞美妙到極點。第二次大會，女會員穿大衣的已不止一位了。春復春兮秋複秋，歲月一年年過去，女會員的衣也也一次會一次會的增加起來，最後不穿大衣的已是鳳毛麟角了。好像穿大衣是女子入會資格之一。</p>
<p>城中某姓家，夫妻間爲了一件大衣弄成感情失和，終且請律師辦理離異訴訟。事情是夫欲妻偕赴杭州，妻因没有大衣不允去，夫定要她去而不肯爲添大衣，妻則表示早製大衣夕即登程。在這樣的相持之下，杭州固然去不成了，且從是好好的夫妻變成陌路人，而終於對簿公庭，勞燕各自東西。</p>
<p>大衣之於都市女子，已成爲不可缺少之物，幸運哉丨時代之産兒！大衣一</p>

<p>— 莘耕</p>
<p>當在這個桃花映面紅，柳色侵衣綠的春光　旎的三月裏，誰也要忙裏抽暇，到龍華去遊玩一次，並登到相傳吳主孫權所建的龍華塔頂上去，憑弔一番，欣賞一番，</p>
<p>在塔上使我們觸目的，在每層的塔壁上，多有或用洋刀刻的，或用墨筆或用鉛筆冩着，囗囗囗到此，囗囗與囗囗來此一遊，囗囗旅行隊到過此地，大同小異的句子，眞是琳瑯滿壁，我也不怪寫的人有損於公德，因爲這是他們的好奇心驅使他們這樣的，他們的用意，就是願意告訴登塔的人，他們來此一遊，但在不久的將來，就是修塔的時候，這此囗囗和囗囗等到此的字跡，都要被白　　救國救國救國救國</p>
<p>只聞樓梯響不見人上來昭</p>
<p>粉打倒了，我想到現在我們的華北，報紙告訴我們：囗囗巳在囗月囗日在囗囗建立了僞國，囗囗軍隊已開到囗囗，欲與華軍囗囗隊，下總擊令，囗囗軍隊已佔據了囗囗，囗機幾架轟炸囗囗，呀這樣奇辱大恥的痕跡，遺留在我們的版圖上，遺留在我們的歷史上，有增無已，這個痕跡，等到幾時要消滅，還是自己會得消滅呢？還是要用力量去消滅呢？我們民衆大家應該們心自問，淸夜自思吧！</p>
<p>大家來檢查生活志欽</p>
<p>一個人的生活良好與否，與社會有極大的關係，所以我們要改良社會刷新政治，對於自己的生活非但要有意義，而且還要有價値，要達到意義價値兼而有之的生活，須有向上的志氣，尤其是要多做造福社會人羣的工作，但是目下一般人所過的生活，眞是無聊之極，他們過了一天就算兩個半日，除了吃飯穿衣飽受個人幸福外，别的事情概不與聞，這種不知人只知己的個人生活，是誤解了做人的意義，</p>
<p>天賦我們的軀壳，並不是呌我們吃掉幾碗飯，穿破幾件衣爲能事，是要我們勞筋骨用智慧來改造社會，刷新國家，社會的健全，須持羣衆力量伸張，政治不良個人力量不足糾正者，應該聯合大衆的力量來改革，不能因爲環境的惡劣或是資格的不及，就放棄了應負的責任，轉抱消極態度不問不聞，讓他们去胡亂　行，這是絶對錯誤的，</p>
<p>吾國因爲吃飯的人不做事，講話的人不實行，人人過着不負責任的個人生活，遂造成了目今的頽喪灰黯局面，所以要挽救國危刷新政治，應先將各個人的生活糾正後纔有辦法，事到如今毋怨政府不替民衆爭出路，也不要駡日本小鬼太欺人，我們應該自行檢查自己所過的生活是否錯誤，有無言行不合的矛盾發現，請大家先來檢查一下再說罷。</p>

<p>回農村去</p>
<p>編者先生，</p>
<p>我是小煙店裏的學徒，今年年底要滿師了。但是我的個性，對於這行行業，根本没有興趣。此外我又没有好親好友，來替我謀一個較好的位置。眼見商界中已没有希望了，因此我想改絃更張，變換方向，來找我光明的前途。</p>
<p>我的家庭，原是在鄕下的；世代以農爲生。我小的時候，因爲身體不大好，就讀上幾年書，跑到都市裏來，棄農習商。現在呢，身體倒好了，商界中旣没有發展希望，很想回去，承繼我世代的本業。但是在我將這意思，告訴了家中之後；前天接到他們的信，說「鄕下的日子，也不好過呢！」</p>
<p>先生，究竟就商的好呢，還是就農的好呢？就商的途徑該怎樣？就農可否維持生活？這樣回去種田，會不會被人恥笑？請你逐一指示。此請</p>
<p>撰安曹瑀謹上</p>
<p>Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ</p>
<p>編者按：社會是整個的，農工商學政，相互聯係。曹君身居商界，只知道商界是没有希望；但是「鄕下的日子，也不好過呢！」這兩句話，是也實情。我們光明的前路，是要「努力」中去求的，單變換變換方向，結果終不免於失望。譬如一個患失眠症的人，向左睡，固然不能成寐，但是向右睡了，又何能成寐呢？現在這不景氣的社會，就像一個人患了失眠症，要是不根本治療，任你如何，是不能有安樂的日子過呢！所以你問「就商好呢，就農好呢？」我們的答復是：「均好」或「均不好」何何論你就商也好，就農她好，都不會有現成的安樂日子，等你去過：你的前途是要從奮鬭中得來。不過話又要說回來了：在商界中奮鬭的對象，完全是「刁尖狠惡」的「人」：農民奮鬭的對象，雖說免不了也有「地主」等一類殺人不怕血醒氣的「人」但至少還有稻粱菽麥黍稷，馬牛羊雞犬豕等一類不會使刁的東西。你多用一分勞力，多少終可以多得一分報酬。曹君，你的個性，旣不近於商界，那末一樣吃苦，還是到農付去罷！至於會不會被人恥笑一層，我們要知道，「用自己的勞力，換自己的飯吃，都是一樣的光榮一；管他怎甚呢！</p>

<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>七·生活的片斷之二</p>
<p>處女的矜誇，在一殺那間便給他完全消毁無遺了。</p>
<p>章大爺在這裏大概接上位了三晚，到後來是隔一二天來一次，據他說，自己的太太總愛盤根問底的。在他深感做一個丈夫眞是十分麻煩，而在她到也落得淸閒。</p>
<p>又是一個月，章大爺便不大來了。但是柳姑娘的手鐲和項圈却老是那末閃光。那一個同伴不暗暗的驚羡；「那只綠玉是多末愛人啊！」</p>
<p>又是晚上，外面下着大雨，怪冷的。</p>
<p>大概是因爲這幾天來每晚都是接客的原故，身體上確是不大舒服，即如腰肢上就是非常脹痛的於是直想到什麽地方去躱避幾天。</p>
<p>狂暴的雨，打在玻璃窗上，她懶懶的倚在窗前，看看那窗櫺上所濺起的兩花。</p>
<p>忽然聽得廳堂中在喊着自己的名字，是那個車夫的聲音：</p>
<p>「柳姑娘，快打扮呀，要出堂差啦。」</p>
<p>又是堂差，眞要把人磨死，於是她氣忿忿的跑到房門邊，喊着說：</p>
<p>「我不去，討厭死了。」</p>
<p>這一聲非同小可，馬上從側面轉出一個死板板的臉孔，兩道有剌的眼光，釘在柳姑娘的臉上。這時柳姑娘很知趣的，立刻換上一副勉强歡笑的臉色，撒嬌似的說：</p>
<p>「媽媽，我今天不想去，頭…………」</p>
<p>「哼，你什麽時候又想去呢？虧你好意思說，難道由你想去就去，不想去便可不去嗎？」</p>
<p>没有辦法，只得轉回房去換衣裳，否則少不了又是一頓臭駡。她忍着滬坐上車去。</p>
<p>兩小時以後，她又坐着車子回來，醉薰薰的，更覺得腦袋沉重。她忘不了在酒樓中所受得輕薄，本來這是十分平凡的，但是今天總覺得格外傷心。她自己不想喝酒，可是被人搿着不得不喝，而且要代替别人喝。喝了酒又吸烟，吸了烟又喝酒。裝着笑臉，口喂菜肴給自己所厭惡的男人。笑，傷心的笑，瘋狂的笑，笑了之後再暗暗的哭。唱戲，啞着嗓子唱戲，每一個聲音迸出來，有如刀割着自己的喉頭。然而得唱下去，唱了一齣還要再來一齣。最後她眞的唱不下去了，脹着靑筋的眼眶裏掛着綫色的涙珠，然而却給客披了一掌重重的耳光，還見他在跳着脚駡：</p>
<p>「我花了一塊錢並不是　你來哭的，你媽的！」</p>
<p>冷風從車蓬裏穿進來，連骨頭裏也在發冷，這當然是喝酒過多的原故。其後車子在自己門前停了下來，只聽得武貴在門邊告訴她說：</p>
<p>「那個章大爺又在等着你。」</p>

<h3 id="c24">影片究竟是怎樣起始的？（下） <a href="#c24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>— 深翁</p>
<p>這裏有一個比較準確的答案！</p>
<p>我父親本來是很富有的，但是因爲研究影片，弄得一貧如洗，還爲了債務關係，吃過官司，在一九二一年五月五日臨死的時候，他還正在一個影片商人會議上演講呢！</p>
<p>我的父親，爲着去搜尋一種適當的柔韌片子，很費了一番憂慮，他知道活動影片的攝取，决不能用玻璃來做底片的材料，至一八八八年，他才發明一種攝影機，可用五十尺長短一種容易感光的紙料，攝成連續的影片，他曾用這種影機，攝取布來屯的街景，後來這一卷片子，因專利權一事，在美國法庭上和愛迪生興訟時，遂成爲一個有力量的證明，我的父親，爲了這件事，並曾一九○年一年到美國去過一次，這一次訴訟，證明我的父親是活動電影照相機的第一個發明人。</p>
<p>但是，那紙片是容易破壞的，於是那假象牙一類東西，就成了玻璃片的代用品了，在伯明罕地方，有一位名呌巴克的假象牙廠長，我的父親，跑去同他商量，二人自此共同研究，一直到第二個攝影機發明後，方才能夠攝取假象牙的臘片，這種攝影機，就是大家知道所謂顯體鏡的攝影機，在一八八九年正月裏，我的父親第一次用臘片攝取活動影戲，是哈德公園的一幕景緻，這一卷片子，也曾送到美國法庭上，用作反對愛迪生的證明。</p>
<p>後來逐漸研究，而一切困難問題，也就逐漸解决，到了一八八九年六月二十一日，我的父親，因爲工程師伊文思的帮助，得獲了影戲攝影機的專利特許證，這天也可以說是第一個活動電影照相機的誔長，雖然世人對於這件事情，不很知道詳細，但是那時報紙上，都曾有過這種記載，這是可以證明的，他曾耗費驻産一萬金鎊去試騐，至一八九一年，他又曾出售房産和一切東西，去料理債務，但是他一點也不心痛。</p>
<p>染色影片，實在也是他發明的，當一九○三年時，我還祗得五歲，他在我們家裏的花園裏，替我拍了一張照片，所有我　身上的紅色白色，都很鮮艶的顯露出來，他死的一年，是六十五歲，我不是告訴你們，他在一個影片商人會議上死去的嗎？當兩個警察把他扛到陳屍所去的時候，發現他的衣袋裏，祇有一個先令和十個辨士，這就是他所遺下來的所有財産，這一點兒錢，恐怕只夠買一張影戲票罷！</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c25">評「血書」 <a href="#c25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>— 燕南</p>
<p>我們先來談談這片的故事：一個女郎和哥哥嫂嫂同住着，女郎的情人因爲要籌措結婚的費用所以到故鄕去了，她哥哥嫂嫂爲貪另一個纨袴子的聘金，硬要把她許婚，她不得已而出走，她的嫂嫂却和紈袴子密秘同居了。洽巧這時女郎的情人已經回來了，便同向紈袴子興師問罪，結果女郎的嫂嫂和紈袴子皆死，女郎哥哥和情人亡命出逃，中途住在一個小客店裏，才知道店主是女郎的族叔，原來女郎也曾投到店裏，自殺未成，被族叔認出，所以大家團圓了。</p>
<p>光線太不好了，忽亮忽暗，攝影師更没有把握，有些動作，竟是顫抖的，糢糊的也不少。</p>
<p>如果說精彩些的地方，那麽只有大打一塲，比較的能使低級趣味的人歡呼一陣吧！字幕這一次倒還可以及格。</p>
<p>這片子在技巧上的漏洞，並非没法補救的，只是導演太大意而已。明知道演員們面部化裝和表演是不能近看的，偏用無數的正面大寫。許多地方寫得也太潦草，絶對的不能把劇中應有的表示出來。脫節不合理處，也都是原可以避免的但是實際上，却非常的多，我舉幾點來說一下吧：</p>
<p>女郎的家境，究竟是否有錢的？如果有錢，爲什麽在乎這一些聘金？爲什麽家中没有僕人？如果没錢，怎麽也没人工作（哥哥是游民）而能生活？爲什麽有這麽大的房子住？女郎逃出被嫂子騙到紈袴子家裏，那麽女郎是不是呆子？怎麽平日對於嫂嫂個性一無所知？少年來告别的時候是步行來的，怎麽回去會有一匹大馬預備着？纨袴子的被焚，怎麽立刻就另有了公館？是否他早就有兩處寓所？女郎下店，當面錯過熟人，身無分文，是否一到店中，就打算自殺？那麽怎又向茶房問路？紈袴子被殺，開放手槍，怎麽會没人知道？傭人和巡捕怎麽一個没有？（本事上有「家人紛紛而出」一句，）……啊，眞是罄紙難述。</p>
<p>我很希望月明公司以後應當好好的努力吧！</p>

<p>這兩位大滑頭到上海來，引動上海中西人士不少興趣。影片公司，跳舞場，咖啡館都以他們一到爲榮，因爲他們滑頭滑腦，一定能轟動人家，齊來瞻仰，那末生意就興隆異常了。聽說九日那天，惠勒和胡爾昔忽然興發，學起拉黄包車來了，而初學就都拉得門檻很精，實在使旁人驚奇不止。但不知道這消息，全上海的黄包車夫可曾知道，有這兩位美國滑稽明星，和你們競爭呢。</p>

<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>看了電影廣告，知道「離婚理由」也是一部烏發出品。也許是因爲它的出品中所給與我的印象，比較的深刻，至少我還滿意它不同於美國片的作風，於是我便懷着大的希望，欣然地買票進場。可是當銀幕上映看ＥＡＤ開始走出劇場的時候，我却情不自禁的倒抽一口冷氣。　　於是，我不能不懷疑過去對於烏發公司的迷戀了。</p>
<p>我們不妨先來談談劇情。一個經理因細故與夫人吵閙一場，甚至於離婚，其後與一少女戀愛，費了許多周拆和「馬克」，到最後總算是結婚了。（當然這中間並不足如此簡單，但亦不必抄錄說明書。）整個的說來，多少是嘲笑了女子的虚榮心，有錢人買愛的巧妙，以及不滿意於法律的兒戲。但是就劇情的本身說，却未免過於凑巧而近於胡閙了。最顯著的是前任司法部長不准他們結婚，於是硬凑上去說；這個司法部長卸行了，而新任的却恰好是經理的私人法律顧問，這當然可以大徇私情，結婚大吉。不過亦有比較可取之處，那便是少女愛錢愛名以至於結婚的過程，編劇者總算是描寫得頗爲精細。</p>
<p>單就劇情而論，眞是淺薄無聊，幸而是導演努力爭氣，將少年們的歡樂和紳士們的歡樂，相對的描寫，以及特别注意到每一個諷剌的場面。然面他並不能彌縫劇情的弱點，雖然不曾增加弱點的暴露，可是充其量也不過是將内容弄得生動了一些。並且有少許笑料，都不自然，但也不像多數美國片的過於誇張。</p>
<p>表演不佳，光線等都較以前的作品遜色。</p>

<p>— 羅芬</p>
<p>給好萊塢的人料到了</p>
<p>珍妮麥唐納到了歐洲之後，好萊塢有說她是去同她的未婚夫結婚的，又有說她是去游歷的。麥唐納去後，希佛萊仍在好萊塢，同别的搭擋合演影片，而置麥唐納於不問，好像以後不再同麥唐納搭擋了。於是好萊塢更有人料麥唐納這一去將不再回好萊塢了。雖然也有說不見得的，但是麥唐納往日的作品，如「旋宫艶史」等，在歐洲人的臘筋中極有佳良的印象，所以她有在歐洲却有立足的可能。</p>
<p>果然給好萊塢的人料到了麥唐納到了歐洲並没有結婚，也没有游歷之意，現在確實的消息傳來，麥唐納已經在歐洲開始銀幕工作了。她的第一次歐洲出品，是一部「皇后」ＴＨＥＯＵＥＥＮ，現在已將攝成一半了。她的第二部亦已經决定是呌做「天堂的患難」ＴＲＯＵＢＬＥＩＮＨＥＡＶＥＮ。男主角亦已經商定，是英國影劇界的有名人物海勃德馬旭ＨＥＲＢＥＲＴＭＡＲＳＨＡＬＬ也是新近期歐洲去的好萊塢明星，所以麥唐納的抛棄好萊塢已成爲實現的事了。</p>

<p>「我因爲並不富裕，所以祗給那車役五十個法郎，而有一位同車的女郎，竟也祗給他五十個法郎。車火僅餘一個座位，在那女郎的旁邊。在法國二個不相識的異性同坐在一起，是很少見的，「我待着，而這位少女也並不讓出一些。後來我發見她就是藝術家琵丹羅（ＢＯＴＴＹＲＯＷＥ）。我就開始和她搭訕，問她可以讓開一些。」</p>
<p>「這樣」，亨利接着說：「我們就此相談終宵。而我倆的愛情也就開幕了。待我匆促的回到柏林後，回來就和她結婚了。」</p>

<p>曼麗因爲不喜歡聽什麽不吉利的話，所以連忙答應「是，是，我曉得。」</p>
<p>麥高芬醫生正預備要走的時候，約翰回來了。麥高芬因爲約翰滿臉露着驚異之色，所以不想將他兒子的病狀立刻告訴他，而問着：「你没有捉到紅臉傑克嗎」</p>
<p>「他的兄弟和旁的兩個人，被我們捉到了。」約翰說時，兩只眼睛看着小約翰的臉。　　「寳甫？」麥高芬摇着頭歎息着。「這事弄糟了。傑克拿寳甫當生命似的保寳，我恐這是惡戰開始的朕兆了。」</p>
<p>約翰連忙將麥高芬拉到一邊，和他商量道：「倘使我有什麽意外之事，你能否設法將她和小約翰送到新英格蘭？」</p>
<p>麥高芬默然地點着頭道：「約翰，這件事你交託我，我一定替你辦到。」他們很嚴肅地握了握手。約翰把醫生送走了，就和曼麗看着小約翰會笑了，他們正在欣喜着。忽然聽見馬蹄疾驟之聲，約翰跑到門口，向外一張，原來是沈香。他急急忙忙地下了馬，喊了進來了「傑克和一大帮子人來了。我看見的，他們一回兒就到！」</p>
<p>約翰吩咐曼麗到臥房裏去，不　動。他和沈香用橙子頂住了大門。那時已將深夜時分，荒野萬籟無聲，但聞寂靜之中馬蹄得得，自遠疾馳而來。</p>
<p>他們一到先放了一槍打在門上，傑克喊着呌約翰卡頓出去答話。約翰聽了傑克聲明倘他不出去，被他們攻進門來，大小俱要殺死的，所以他爲曼麗和小約翰的安全起見，想出去和他厠殺一下。正當他要拔關而出的時候，曼麗攔阻着，不放他出去，要死寗可一起死，不然約翰死了，她亦不能獨活。所以裏雙就轟擊起來了，這時曼　已將小約翰放在臥室裏小床上，用被蓋了起來，她加入了戰團，專司替沈香和約翰裝子彈。傑克和他的黨羽轟　了半天，還是攻不進。他們於是找到了一塊大木頭，幾個抬着萊撞門。約翰的屋，本是木頭造的，所以給這樣大木頭一撞，就吱吱的呌起來，好似要倒塌的樣子。正在這危急萬分之中，臥室裏又有微細的哭聲透了出來。曼麗聽見了，急忙跑進去。她將小約翰抱了起來。他好似睡着似的；她親著他的臉，摸著的手，怎麽有些發　冰冷似的。她害怕起來了。她回過身，搶了一面鏡了，放小約翰的嘴上，仍舊一些水汽没有。他死了！曼麗亦呆若木鷄似的站著，外面的戰事緊急，她亦忘死了。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Multiple Disasters Invigorate the Nation <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>May is a month of multiple disasters for our country. Dates like May 3rd, May 9th, and May 30th overlap, each a memorial day for our unbearable national humiliation, etched with deep wounds and blurred with tears of blood. Looking north, our mountains and rivers are shattered. The Northeast has already fallen, and Peiping and Tientsin are once again teetering on the brink. The national humiliations of the past have not yet been washed away, while the current foreign enemies are becoming increasingly urgent, and the national crisis is deepening. When we think of the great disasters to come, we truly cannot suppress the feeling of wanting to cry but having no tears left to shed.</p>
<p>Since the Opium War, our country has gradually become the target of foreign powers' covetous eyes. Up until the September 18th Incident of two years ago, for over a century, our country has not had a single day free from the trampling and carving up by the great powers, barely clinging to its last breath. Japan's aggression against us has now lasted for over sixty years. The pain we have endured in these hundred-plus years cannot be said to be anything but deep and severe. The enlightened individuals within the country have exhausted their strength and strained their voices, running around and shouting day and night to save the country. Their efforts cannot be said to be anything but diligent and long-lasting. However, up to this day, the national crisis remains the same, and even intensifies. What is the reason for this? After deep thought and silent contemplation, we cannot but attribute it to the disunity and lack of organization among our people.</p>
<p>Why do we say this? The organization of a nation is what prevents the invasion of foreign races. Therefore, the first essential of a nation is that the entire people must have a strong organization to gather collective strength to resist foreign enemies. But what about our country? All that the people strive for in their lives never extends beyond the scope of their families. The nation's interests are regarded as if they are unseen. The people's strength only reaches their own families, and nothing beyond that. Since the people lack a strong organization, they are naturally scattered and disunited. Therefore, even though there are over four hundred million people, their strength never extends beyond a single family or clan. Moreover, it is not only the people who are scattered and lack organization. Even those who call themselves political groups are actually very scattered and unable to be united. Once a foreign invasion comes, how can they withstand it?</p>
<p>So, what should we do now? It depends on the awakening of our people. There is no other way to awaken than to change the previous disorganized and scattered state and replace it with a strong and organized group. The people should do this, and even more so, organizations should do this. They must completely abandon the previous state of each acting on their own and each being isolated, and replace it with working together with one heart and one mind, as a whole group. Only then can we safeguard our country. We are not unaware that the invasion of foreign races is also a cause of our country's weakness. However, we should first… There is a saying, "Multiple disasters invigorate the nation." If we are willing to make the greatest determination and completely change the previous scattered and disunited… to deal with foreign enemies, then who knows, the overlapping national humiliations of the past may actually be the driving force for our nation's revival. It is up to people to make it happen. If we want to exchange the national humiliations of the past century for the infinite light of the future, then everyone in the country should think carefully about the saying "Multiple disasters invigorate the nation."</p>
<p>Economic Talks in Washington</p>
<p>China and the United States Reach an Understanding</p>
<p>Minister Song Supports U.S. Silver Policy and Tariff Truce</p>
<p>The Two Countries Can Cooperate Closely in the World Economic Conference</p>
<p>(Washington) According to Chinese Finance Minister Song Ziwen today, U.S. President Roosevelt and he have reached a complete understanding regarding the silver plan to be proposed at the World Conference, and they also agree on many other financial and economic matters. Mr. Song told reporters today, "We have reached a general agreement on silver tariffs and most other financial and economic matters. China will cooperate closely with the U.S. representatives in many aspects at the London Conference. China is very concerned about stabilizing silver prices and agrees with the principle of a tariff truce. As for any special trade agreements, they have not been discussed because we are focusing all our efforts on creating a plan that both countries can support." Mr. Song also told reporters that China's commercial decline due to military affairs in the north was naturally discussed, but the Chinese-Japanese dispute was not mentioned because he was a guest of the President and was invited to discuss economic issues, so it did not seem appropriate to bring up the Chinese-Japanese dispute while being a guest. He also said that he was deeply moved by the President's enthusiasm and friendship. As for the various events to be discussed at the London Conference, he also agreed with most of the opinions expressed by British Prime Minister MacDonald the other day. Finally, when asked about China's attitude towards the Russian-Japanese dispute over the… Road, Mr. Song replied that he believed that his government had been able to make it clear that China would abide by the Sino-Russian Agreement signed in Beijing in 1924. (National Telegraph on the 10th)</p>
<p>(New York) The New York Times reported that Chinese Finance Minister Song Ziwen said that China supports the U.S. silver policy at the World Economic Conference and that the country's actions to raise silver prices are not as important as achieving exchange rate stability. China does not want to adopt the gold standard, nor does it want to establish a bimetallic system. When asked if excessively high silver prices would inevitably disrupt China's trade, Song replied, "What is an excessively high silver price? No one can be sure." (Reuters Telegraph on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Washington) When asked if China agreed to a tariff truce, Song Ziwen said that China supports this proposal and that any trade agreements between the United Kingdom, the United States, and France could be considered beneficial to China because China's happiness depends on the overall recovery of world trade. (Reuters Telegraph on the 10th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, people in Washington, D.C., claimed that after the opening of the World Economic Conference, China, the United Kingdom, and the United States would all support tariff reform and the principles of equality, raising prices, stabilizing exchange rates, and removing trade barriers. As for improving the position of silver, it is expected that the United Kingdom will not oppose a reasonable plan, but its position is different from that of China and the United States. It is also rumored that the U.S. President and the Chinese Finance Minister have reached an agreement on a silver plan to be presented in London, the content of which will be much more moderate than what the U.S. silver faction advocates, but this has not yet been confirmed by official sources. (National Telegraph on the 10th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Chinese Minister of Finance of the Executive Yuan, Song Ziwen, issued a statement to the press, saying, "To solve the economic panic, it is necessary to raise the prices of raw materials, but it is also necessary to stabilize the currency." Mr. Song then explained the achievements of the National Government in reorganizing finances and balancing the budget, saying that the recent abolition of the tael and the change to the yuan, the unification of the currency system, and the abolition of likin have all been accomplished, and strict measures have been taken to reduce government expenses. When reporters asked for his opinion on the Sino-Japanese dispute and various diplomatic issues, Song Ziwen refused to answer, saying, "The facts of the escalation of the Sino-Japanese dispute are most eloquent and do not need comment." Mr. Song then discussed the difficulties of China's internal affairs, saying that there was indeed a communist danger in several southern provinces. Previously, the central government had no choice but to withdraw some of the troops suppressing the communists to resist the Japanese army, so the communists had a few small victories. Reporters then asked about the attitude towards "Manchukuo." Song replied that the residents of Manchuria are almost all Chinese and have never had any regional prejudices, which is something that the Chinese people will never forget. Therefore, even if Manchuria establishes a customs union with Japan, imposing heavy taxes on goods from the mainland, the mainland will continue to import goods from Manchuria. Regarding economic issues, Mr. Song said that if silver prices can be raised, China's purchasing power will greatly increase, and the Chinese are extremely concerned about the issue of high silver prices. In addition, the Chinese government is very supportive of the tariff truce plan. When reporters asked whether the open-door policy could continue to be implemented in Manchuria, Mr. Song replied, "Korea also implemented the open-door policy at one time, but what is it like now?"

<p>Roosevelt and German Representatives</p>
<p>Discuss Disarmament and Security</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt's last meeting with German representative Schacht was to discuss security and disarmament issues. Mr. Roosevelt did not hesitate to express clearly his serious concerns about the rising tide of German nationalism. He also believed that Germany's attitude in Geneva was contrary to the purpose of the disarmament conference. He also mentioned that Germany's insistence on its new demands for huge weapons and naval forces would likely lead to the failure of the entire disarmament conference. President Roosevelt wanted Schacht to agree to dissolve the National Defense Force and replace it with a militia, but Schacht refused to discuss it, saying that he had not been instructed to do so. The points emphasized by the U.S. delegation to the disarmament conference were the abolition of certain weapons used for attack, the establishment of a monitoring system when the disarmament plan is implemented, and the conclusion of a consultation treaty to define the aggressor country in order to increase security. (Havas Telegraph on the 10th)</p>
<p>The U.S. Government Will Ask Congress</p>
<p>To Approve Deferred Payment of War Debts</p>
<p>(New York) The New York Times Washington correspondent telegraphed that after discussing the war debt issue with President Roosevelt, a senior government official expressed his opinion today, saying that the government will ask Congress to approve the deferred payment of war debts, and Congress will certainly approve this request. The government only wants to enjoy this privilege while the World Economic Conference is in progress. As for any temporary solutions, they will naturally be submitted to Congress for approval. The text of President Roosevelt's request to Congress for special powers to handle reciprocal tariff negotiations has already been agreed upon and will be submitted to Congress as soon as there is a confirmed hope of success for the tariff truce proposal. The proposal stipulates that the President has the power to adjust import taxes and compromise with other countries to determine the difference in production costs, and the countries concerned must also make similar concessions. Any bilateral contracts must aim to promote U.S. export trade. The consumption import taxes imposed on coal, wood, oil, and copper last year will not be abolished. (Reuters Telegraph on the 10th)</p>
<p>The Organizing Committee Will Meet Today</p>
<p>To Discuss the Tariff Truce</p>
<p>(London) The World Economic Conference Organizing Committee was originally scheduled to meet today to discuss President Roosevelt's tariff truce proposal, but because several representatives have not yet received final instructions from their governments, the meeting has been postponed to tomorrow. (Reuters Telegraph on the 11th)</p>

<p>U.S. Companies Are Deeply Concerned</p>
<p>(New York) The Japanese government plans to build many factories in Manchuria to refine kerosene. U.S. kerosene companies are deeply concerned that this move will harm the interests of the U.S. kerosene industry in the Far East. (Havas Telegraph on the 10th)</p>
<p>British Parliament Discusses the Jinpu Railway</p>
<p>(London) British Foreign Secretary Simon said in the House of Commons today in response to a question from a member, "I have no reason to say that the monthly deposits of the Jinpu Railway are not being settled on time. The interest that has been in arrears for the longest time has now been paid." As for the exact amount of the existing debt repayment reserve, there has been no news, but it is known that the monthly deposits have increased since the implementation of the original agreement.

<p>(Nanjing) A suggestion from the Tibetan representatives to the Central Political Conference roughly stated that the case of the Regulations for the Organization of the Western Border Propaganda Public Office had been approved by the National Government and submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review. The relationship between China and Tibet has been long-standing. Since the Republic of China, it has unfortunately been interrupted due to the border affairs of Sichuan and Tibet. In the 18th year, the National Government sent a special commissioner to Tibet to comfort the Dalai Lama, forcefully rejected the proposal, and resolutely sent representatives to Beijing. Tibet's original close relationship with the central government already had the beginning of peaceful restoration. Even in the 20th year, the Panchen Lama came to Beijing to request a title, which had other effects, but the central government did not observe the proposed intention to give it to the Western Border Propaganda Envoy. The representatives were afraid that this matter would cause other disputes and affect Tibetan affairs, and after forceful obstruction, it was stopped. Unexpectedly, in the 21st year, the old matter was brought up again and was actually published, which led to a meeting of monks, officials, and the entire population of the three major monasteries in Tibet, and a declaration was issued.</p>

<p>Will Be Subordinate to the Judicial Yuan</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan's review committee discussed the issue of the subordination of the Ministry of Judicial Administration. The results were that the Judicial Yuan only has the Supreme Court.

In order to maintain the spirit of the five powers, it is believed that the ministry should be changed to be subordinate to the Judicial Yuan. The opinion has been signed and sent to the Yuan for deliberation and decision. (Special Telegraph on the 11th)</p>

The association's address is temporarily set up at the Aviation Administration. The most central issue to be discussed in the future will be the fundraising method. The donations raised by various parties in the past have not been a large amount. There are requests for the government to order all counties in the country to add donations under certain tax items, but the people's burden is already heavy, so whether or not additional taxes can be added will be carefully discussed at the meeting. It is best not to add additional taxes to the people and to find other practical ways. As for the use of the funds after they are raised, it will be decided by the central government whether to purchase aircraft or anti-aircraft guns. Construction should focus on fundraising as the most central task. Since September 18th, the enemy's planes have often assisted in the battle, and our country has few planes to fight back, and I also feel uneasy. (Special Telegraph on the 11th)</p>

<h3 id="e2">The Riverbed of Qibao Town Before the Dredging of Puhuitang <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>I</p>
<p>For the dredging of Puhuitang, the agreement of Commissioners Zhang Shouyong, Lu Jianquan, Hu Junzhuang, Shi Liangcai, Zhang Gongquan, Li Fusun, Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, Wu Tiecheng, Hu Bijang, Gu Zhutong, Dong Xiujia, Chen Gongbo, Huang Shaohong, Peng Xuepei, Qin Runqing, Zhu Jiahua, and Liu Ruiheng was obtained. Approval was granted by the Executive Yuan to allocate funds for the dredging. The undertakers were administrative officials, assisted by elders such as Ma Xiangbo of the Committee to Expedite the Dredging of Puhuitang. The river depth was set at eight feet, similar to the dredging in the ninth year of Tongzhi, a sight unseen in over sixty years. Currently, the completed sections not only allow smooth passage for civilian boats, but also completely changed the old situation for farmland irrigation. Moreover, a shipping company organized by merchants and gentry in Sijing is reportedly about to start operations. Its contribution to the development and circulation of the rural economy in the three counties of Shang, Song, and Qing is substantial. The project has lasted four months from commencement to date.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Inspection and Acceptance</p>
<p>When inspecting and accepting the Song and Qing sections yesterday, Songjiang County Magistrate Jin Tigian and Qingpu County Magistrate Shen Yong were present as representatives, along with hundreds of local people. Commissioners Zhang Chunyong and Hu Junzhuang gave speeches, stating that during this time of national crisis and financial difficulty, Minister Song had the enthusiasm and determination to advocate for the project, viewing river dredging as a key task for rural relief. Minister Song had previously overseen the Wanli Long Dike project for the Yongding River disaster relief committee. This canal project is only one-thousandth of his past endeavors, but the canal's strategic importance relates to the lives and property of hundreds of thousands of people along the canal. The benefits and harms are experienced by the local people themselves, so it is hoped that the public will appreciate the difficulty of the construction and protect it at all times for perpetuity. Afterwards, the local representatives gave a response of gratitude, intending to build a pavilion and erect a monument to record their gratitude. A group photo was taken, and everyone departed joyfully.</p>
<p>The Postal Research Meeting Still Not Concluded Yesterday</p>
<p>Differences in Opinion Between the Ministry and Workers on Personnel Issues at the Savings and Remittance Bureau</p>
<p>Meeting Continued This Afternoon at 5 PM After Meeting Minister Zhu</p>
<p>The Postal Economic System Research Committee held its seventh meeting yesterday at 6:00 PM at the Municipal Government in Fenglinqiao, continuing the discussion on the consolidation of the postal foundation outline, lasting three hours. Due to the merger of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, the personnel issues caused disagreement between the ministry's committee members and the workers' representatives. It was decided that the workers' representatives would visit Minister Zhu this afternoon and then continue the meeting at 5:00 PM this afternoon to discuss the matter. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Attendees</p>
<p>Those present yesterday included committee members Wu Tiecheng, Lin Kanghou, Yu Qiaqing, Pan Gongzhan, Lin Shi, Tang Baoshu, Huang Naishu, special committee members Lin Cong, Li Gan, Jing Runshi, Wang Wenwei, and postal worker representatives Qi Jiamou, Zhu Xuefan, Shi Taitang, Fan Caicong, Lu Keming, Zhao Shusheng, Ge Fei, Shi Jikuan, Zhang Kechang, Zhu Jingsheng, Zheng Zhonghuang, Kang Yong, and others. Wu Tiecheng chaired the meeting.</p>
<p>Meeting Details</p>
<p>After the meeting began, the reform outline for consolidating the postal foundation was discussed item by item. The first, third, and fourth sections regarding the introduction, airmail subsidies, and ministry funding were slightly amended and passed. The three items of the second section on postal savings and remittance were also passed. However, on item D, regarding personnel selection and the performance evaluation of savings and remittance personnel, the postal worker representatives insisted that existing staff should be incorporated into the postal staff ranks after examination. The three ministry committee members stated that they were adhering to the ministry's intention to maintain the original plan. The two sides debated without reaching a resolution. Finally, the chairman proposed that committee members Lin Kanghou and Pan Gongzhan, along with the worker representatives, should visit Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Communications this afternoon to directly inquire about the opinions of both sides, and then continue the meeting at 5:00 PM this afternoon to make a decision. Regardless of whether the opinions of the ministry and workers can converge, the research committee will pass the outline and report it to the Executive Yuan.</p>
<p>The Returned Overseas Chinese Travel Propaganda Team</p>
<p>Fifth Detachment Arrives in Shanghai</p>
<p>The Fifth Detachment of the Returned Overseas Chinese Travel Propaganda Team, consisting of thirteen men and women, led by Director Wen Kaixuan, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday from Guangzhou. They plan to promote resistance against Japan to all sectors and raise funds to慰勞the soldiers on the front lines and rescue the wounded. After staying in Shanghai for a week, they will go to the capital and then north to participate in the war on the front lines. After the team arrived in Shanghai, in addition to sending letters to various party and government agencies, they also issued a declaration, the original text of which is as follows: It has been over two years since the September 18th Incident. The lost territories of the three provinces have not been recovered, and the border passes have fallen one by one. The key points of the Great Wall have been lost successively. The national situation is deteriorating daily, and the territory is shrinking. In the future, the entire North China and the entire China will face an even more unbearable future. This is truly an extraordinary catastrophe in the history of our country, and it cannot be tolerated or ignored. The invading Japanese are disregarding international justice and human morality, advancing step by step, which is a predetermined plan. They aim to destroy the entire China and seize the lives and property of the entire Chinese people as sacrifices for their hegemony in the world. Their ambition is already clearly revealed. Therefore, the Northeast Incident is related to the survival of our entire nation, not a local issue. All Chinese people should do their best and rise up to resist Japan, no longer relying on waiting and watching, no longer enjoying themselves in ease and comfort. We must know that resisting Japan is fighting for human justice, resisting Japan is fighting for world peace, and resisting Japan is fighting for the permanent happiness and well-being of ourselves and our descendants. In the past, not resisting Japan was a mistake that harmed the country. Now, not resisting Japan is sitting and waiting for the country to be destroyed. Since the outbreak of the national crisis, the members of our team have been promoting resistance against Japan and saving the country. Over the years, we have traveled north and south, crying and pleading. Now that the military situation in North China has reached the most critical moment, we have made up our minds to go north again to participate in the war on the front lines. Along the way, we will also promote resistance to Japan to our compatriots, vowing to use pure tears to sound the alarm for saving the country, and vowing to shed pure blood on the front lines of resistance. If the territory is not recovered, we will not turn back. As we are about to depart, we hope that our compatriots from all walks of life will appreciate our loyalty and rise up together to save the country from danger. We cannot express our hopes and prayers enough. This declaration is hereby made.</p>
<p>The Hui People</p>
<p>The Cultural Promotion Association Telegraphed the Central Government</p>
<p>To Organize a New Incident Investigation Committee</p>
<p>Ma Tianying and others from the Chinese Hui Cultural Promotion Association telegraphed the Central Government yesterday, saying: "To the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters, the Executive Yuan, the Military Affairs Commission, and the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, Greetings. We have learned that national equality and freedom of religion are basic tenets of our party and also important principles of the provisional constitution. Today, the violent Japanese are encroaching upon us, seizing Manchuria and Mongolia, attacking North China, and coveting Tibet, emboldened by their wild ambitions. The unity of the five ethnic groups is like ice on fire, gradually disintegrating. However, our Hui people have been sincere and loyal, supporting the Central Government and remaining steadfast from beginning to end. But Jin Shuren, using Xinjiang as his remote base, imposed harsh taxes and violent levies, killing innocent people. On one hand, he wantonly suppressed the people; on the other hand, he deceived the Central Government, causing millions of Hui people to hold grievances and remain unheard, which led to today's incident. We, the committee members, are aware that the Central Government is facing many difficulties and frequent foreign invasions, endangering the country. Therefore, regarding this new incident, we respectfully offer our humble suggestions. We, the committee members, deeply know that if this new incident is not properly handled, the truth will be obscured, and the hearts of the Hui people will be lost. In the future, it will inevitably lead to an uncontrollable wildfire. Although the Central Government has now selected members for appeasement, this matter is of great importance, and the new territory is vast. We, the committee members, following the Central Government's intention to accept advice and employ talents, in order to avoid disputes and achieve perfection, believe that a New Incident Investigation Committee could be organized from among the Han and Hui leaders, with Fang Juehui, a Central Committee member who is unanimously supported by the majority of Hui people, as the director, and Ma Liang, a counselor of the Hui Military Council, Tang Kesan, a member of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, Sun Shengwu, a member of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, Wang Zengshan, a legislator, Ma Jun, the former director of the Shanxi Provincial Government, Xiao Gongyuan, a member of the Han Military Affairs Commission, Zhu Shikang, a senior editor of the Legislative Yuan and a specialist member of the Ministry of Industry, Shen Lingxiao, a counselor of the Military Affairs Commission, and Xiong Jinhuai, a former member of the Hubei Provincial Government, etc., as members. They should take the road through Jiayuguan, Hami, Turpan, and other places to conduct on-the-spot investigations and assist in appeasement, convey the hidden feelings of the Hui people, and demonstrate the justice of the Central Government. Then, the Hui people in southern Xinjiang will not be difficult to subdue. In this way, not only can the estrangement between the Hui and Han be eliminated, but also the foundation for the harmonious co-existence of the Hui and Han in the Northwest will be permanently established. In this urgent telegram, we eagerly await orders. Committee members of the Chinese Hui Cultural Promotion Association: Ma Tianying, Ding Zhennan, Ha Decheng, Da Pusheng, Mu Haipeng, Ma Zhenqing, et al., bow their heads."</p>
<p>Huang Fu Pays Attention to the People in the War Zone</p>

During the conversation, He relayed Huang's intention, saying that the people in the war zone are displaced, dying, and suffering unspeakably. Relief and rehabilitation are the unavoidable responsibility of the political authorities, but the disaster is too severe, and social organizations must work together. Therefore, he asked Zhu to continue to act according to his original aspirations and to do his best. The government will also do its best to help. It is also heard that when Wang Kemin, the designated Director of Finance, visited Huang at his private residence a few days ago, Huang also discussed with him the financial situation and whether there was any surplus to engage in relief efforts.</p>

<p>Shen Bao Monthly Telegraphed Condolences to Tan Yunshan</p>
<p>Mr. Tan Yunshan has studied in India for many years and has researched the local customs, folklore, religions, and habits. Shen Bao Monthly published his article "Gandhi's Truth Academy 숙" in its New Year's issue this year. Later, the magazine continued to disclose his recent work "Indian Jottings" in the March issue, which was very popular with readers. Yesterday, the newspaper reported from Nanjing that Mr. Tan was on a hunger strike with Gandhi starting from the 10th, out of sympathy for Gandhi. The magazine sent a telegram of condolence, the original text of which is as follows: "To Mr. Tan Yunshan, care of the Chinese Buddhist Society, Xihua Gate, Nanjing, we are extremely surprised and admire your hunger strike with Gandhi. However, resisting tyranny lies in active struggle. We hope that you will resume eating immediately and continue to strive for cultural causes. We hope that you will write and send the sequel to 'Indian Jottings' as agreed. Shen Bao Monthly, sincerely."</p>
<p>The Families of Su Ma and Other Departments Continue to Arrive</p>
<p>The Public Security Bureau Asks the Refugee Association to Host Them</p>
<p>The Shanghai Public Security Bureau sent a letter to the Shanghai Charity Organizations Joint Relief Association for Northeastern Refugees yesterday, stating: "Greetings. We have received Instruction No. 773 from the Municipal Government, which states: 'We have approved a telegram from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which states: "Confidential. One hundred and fourteen refugees from Su, Li, Wang, and other departments who retreated into Russian territory were unable to catch the Wuyang Wheel. They are now returning to China on the Norwegian ship TORNY from Vladivostok on the first of this month. They are expected to arrive in Shanghai in four or five days. We hope you will instruct staff to take good care of them when they arrive."' We hereby inform you of this. Please inquire at any time when the ship will arrive in Shanghai, send staff immediately to take care of them, and report the handling situation. We have already sent staff to inquire about the exact date of the ship's arrival and take good care of them. Subsequently, it was reported that the refugees are mostly family members of important military officers of the Su, Ma, and other departments, totaling one hundred and fifteen men, women, and children. They arrived on the 8th of this month at 2:00 PM, and our staff took good care of them. Fifty-eight people were escorted to the Jiangxi Guild Hall for temporary accommodation, and fifty-seven women and children were sent to the Oriental Hotel in Xiaodongmen for temporary accommodation. Upon investigation, these family members of the Northeastern anti-Japanese personnel have suffered national disaster, resulting in displacement. Their situation is particularly pitiful and should be quickly relieved to comfort the loyal and fulfill our duties. However, the number of people is large, the expenses are huge, and all the care is very complicated. The Bureau's funds and personnel are both lacking. We hereby request your association to investigate and dispatch staff quickly to handle this matter together. We look forward to your assistance."</p>

<p>The Sanyou Factory Labor-Capital Litigation Case</p>
<p>The Court Held a Hearing to Enforce the Order Yesterday</p>
<p>Ordering the Capitalists to Pay Food Allowances Within a Time Limit</p>
<p>While Still Hoping for a Settlement Between Both Sides</p>
<p>The dispute over the shutdown of the Sanyou Industrial General Factory in Pudong has been ongoing for years due to the capitalists' refusal to accept arbitration. It has now been consulted by the Executive Yuan to the Judicial Yuan for interpretation and should be handled in accordance with the newly promulgated Labor Dispute Handling Law. The local court held a hearing to enforce the order yesterday. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Arbitration Method</p>
<p>The dispute in the case has been going on for a long time and has been mediated by the party and government to no avail. Therefore, the municipal government specially organized a labor-capital arbitration committee, which announced the arbitration method on September 1st of last year as follows: (1) The Sanyou Industrial Society Yingxianggang Factory should resume a portion of its work within three months, with a minimum capacity to accommodate one-fifth of the original workers. Before resumption, the society should pay the workers' food allowance according to the original proportion. (2) The remaining workers may be dismissed according to the original labor-capital contract, but when the Shanghai and Hangzhou factories hire workers, they should give priority to the dismissed workers.</p>
<p>Involvement Process</p>
<p>The capitalists refused to accept the arbitration and filed a lawsuit with the local court, which was subsequently rejected. The capitalists still refused to accept the judgment and appealed to the Suzhou Higher Court. The higher court's trial result considered the original judgment to be correct and therefore rejected the appeal. The capitalists still refused to accept the judgment and appealed to the Nanjing Supreme Court, which ruled that the appeal was unreasonable and rejected it. The judgment was delivered to both labor and capital parties some time ago. The labor party (Cotton Weaving Industry Union of the Seventh District) considered that all workers had suffered from unemployment for more than a year and that their lives were in extreme panic. Therefore, after receiving the final judgment of the three trials, they immediately applied to the Shanghai Local Court for a speedy trial and compulsory execution in accordance with Article 38, Paragraph 2 of the newly promulgated revised Labor Dispute Handling Law and the Judicial Yuan's interpretation of the law No. 871. After the court approved the application, it scheduled the hearing for enforcement at 2:00 PM yesterday.</p>
<p>Hearing and Enforcement</p>
<p>At 2:00 PM yesterday, the hearing was held. Labor representatives Shuang Yuting and Zhang Yihai, proxy lawyer Wei Wenhan, capital representative Wang Xianhua, and proxy lawyer Tan Yigong arrived on time first. Dozens of factory workers and capital employees went to the hearing to listen. Judge Pang Shurong opened the second execution court for enforcement. First, the capital's lawyer stated that the case had been concluded after three trials, but that it did not involve enforcement issues. The effect of enforcement now arises from the arbitration award. The company's office is located on Nanjing Road, which belongs to the First Special District Court. Before enforcement, the issue of court jurisdiction should be resolved first. The labor proxy lawyer Wei Wenhan then stated that the case occurred in Yingxianggang, which should be under the jurisdiction of the court. Moreover, the arbitration was conducted by the municipal government, so there is no reason why the arbitration award cannot be enforced. In short, enforcement in the Special District Court is legal, and enforcement in the Local Court is also legal. The issue of jurisdiction does not arise. The court should strictly enforce the arbitration award. However, full enforcement may not be possible within three to five days, and all workers are already on the verge of starvation. The court should order the capitalists to pay the workers' food allowance from the date of suspension to save the workers' lives. The capital's lawyer immediately argued that the food allowance should be paid according to the law, but it must be conveyed to the company. It can be approved. However, the company is trying to find a solution to the restoration of the work of one-fifth of the workers and the dismissal of four-fifths of the workers. However, due to economic and personnel issues, he asked the court to grant a certain period of time and order the labor party to copy and send the roster of all workers. After hearing the request, the judge immediately announced that the hearing would continue on the afternoon of the 25th of this month at 2:00 PM. He hoped that both parties would find a solution outside the court during the extension period. As for the workers' food allowance, it should be given to the labor party at 24 yuan per day from the date of suspension in accordance with the arbitration award and should be paid in full within one month. Then, the court was adjourned.</p>
<p>Dock Coolies Are Not Allowed to Organize Groups</p>
<p>The French General Inspectorate's Statement</p>
<p>There is a type of group in the French Concession that is currently registering dock coolies.

<p>Dong Kang Submits a Petition to the Ministry of Justice on Behalf of Prisoners</p>
<p>Thorough Investigation of the Long-Standing Malpractices of Caohejing Prison</p>
<p>Confiscation of Clothing and Arbitrary Abuse Led to Many Deaths</p>
<p>Entering the Infirmary Is Tantamount to Announcing Departure from the World</p>
<p>Violates the Original Intent of Criminal Law and Impedes the Uniformity of Legal Authority</p>
<p>Xin Sheng She stated that there are currently more than 2,000 prisoners in the Caohejing Jiangsu Second Model Prison, and the management is corrupt, arousing the dissatisfaction of all prisoners. Some prisoners, such as Wang Jiaxiang and Lu Zongduan, have specifically requested Dong Kang, a senior lawyer, to submit a petition to the Ministry of Judicial Administration, demanding a thorough eradication of prison malpractices, improvement of treatment, and protection of human rights. We have obtained the following complaint: The prison is rife with malpractices, and we appeal for a thorough investigation and practical improvement. Since the reform in our country, criminal law has adopted imprisonment as the primary punishment. The initial drafting of the prison law focused on inherent human rights and established new model prisons in large towns to serve as models. Although it could not be as grand and perfect as in Europe and the United States due to economic constraints, the judicial authorities diligently explored the historical regulations of the land and the good practices of recent foreign precedents. It barely satisfied popular expectations. However, years of internal strife and social unrest turned the official career into a gamble, ignoring God's observation, so that the prison plan that had just sprouted was also destroyed at once. All of this is generally recognized by public opinion and is not a slanderous statement of a few criminals. Imprisonment is based on the deprivation of freedom, but within the regulations, some rights are still enjoyed. However, the Caohejing Prison is greatly mistaken. The complainant is one of the victims of abuse and, without fear of harm, carefully details the following to the superiors. First, the confiscation of prisoner rations and abuse: This prison has always detained criminal offenders and military offenders. The prisoner ration for criminal offenders is set at 3.6 yuan per person per month, and the military offenders are 4.5 yuan. Two meals a day are provided, 20 taels per day for criminal offenders and 24 taels for military offenders. About 2,000 prisoners in the entire prison need about 11 stones of rice. In order to seek cheap prices, it is filled with stale and moldy rice bran, which has no nutritional value. The vegetables used are rotten turnips or rotten yellow leafy vegetables with roots and mud, about 200 catties, 10 catties of soybean oil, plus salt and charcoal. The daily cost is less than 100 yuan, that is, an average of 5 or 6 cents per prisoner per day. It is impossible to be full, let alone nutritious. The prison guards report oil tofu and bean sprouts, which are all false. The winter cotton clothes and quilts purchased by donations are withheld. Sometimes, to cover up for visitors, they are issued and then immediately taken back. This year, the cold is too severe, and the cries of cold every night are unbearable. Prisoners are occasionally guilty of minor offenses. If they are light, they are beaten and scolded. If they are serious, they are shackled, regardless of their physical condition. As a result, those who die from hunger, cold, and abuse are too numerous to list. The number of people in the prison is crowded, the air is turbid when it is sunny, and the room is dripping with rain, which is even more difficult to describe. Second, medicine and hygiene: The prison room is different from ordinary places and is easy to cause illness. The number of sick prisoners can determine the performance of prison guards. The equipment in the prison clinic is inadequate, and the medical officer lacks scholarship. Sick prisoners are not treated for one or two weeks. It is even more absurd to prescribe a common prescription for the majority of prisoners. The prisoner nurses are all short-term prisoners and have no sense of responsibility for treating sick prisoners. They even benefit from their rapid death and obtain their belongings. The day a prisoner enters the ward is like the day he announces his departure from the world. Bathing is a necessary hygienic measure. According to the rules, from June to September each year, you can take a bath once a week for a maximum of 10 minutes. There are only two bathhouses, which are less than a square zhang, and 2,000 people are reading. It is impossible to change the bath soup, so hygiene is a false name. Third, confiscation of prisoner items and work: In the winter of last year, due to the recovery of legal rights, an international judicial investigation team came to China and visited various prisons. At that time, the prison was repainted, and prisoners were allowed to bring their own utensils to create a spectacular view. However, no register was established in advance, and all were confiscated afterwards, and the prices were not small. Political prisoners are allowed to read books on self-cultivation, etc., and there are also cases of all being confiscated. In addition, prisoners often send money and prepare their own food, which is managed by the custodian. The custodian does not issue receipts and calculates arbitrarily without proof to verify. If the prisoner's family sends items by mail, which does not violate the rules, the prison guards regard it as a hindrance to hygiene and detain it. After the prisoner pleads in writing, he is threatened with shackles. Under the accumulation of prestige, they are all silent. The income from the labor of prisoners is huge, but the prisoners get very little, and the inside story is even more unbearable to hear. In short, it is nothing more than absorbing the spirit of prisoners and depriving prisoners of their labor to fill the private pockets of a few people. Fourth, cessation of visits, communications, and detention of mail: According to the rules, prisoners are allowed to visit and communicate with their relatives once a month. The good intention of comforting the prisoner's departure in the midst of suffering is the purpose. Prison guards do not declare the reason for stopping visits and communications to all political prisoners. Recently, they have also isolated the communication of good prisoners and cut off all material assistance. The above are all common knowledge. Prisoners are born outside and violate the constitution. They are trying to use the encouragement of iron windows to make a treasure raft to cross the lost. They are threatened by lascivious power and will be imprisoned for a long time. Compared with those who are sentenced to death, the pain is even more doubled. Shanghai is the first commercial port in our country, and the quality of justice is related to the unified legal authority. It is not superficial. I have always thought that you have great virtue and the world is for the public. I humbly present the above and ask you to review and send personnel to thoroughly investigate to rectify discipline and protect human rights. I am unable to express the fear of waiting for orders. Respectfully submitted to the Ministry of Judicial Administration."</p>
<p>The Case of the Western Police Kicking Gao Yatou to Death</p>
<p>Two Groups Continued to Meet Yesterday</p>
<p>Demanding the Court to Re-examine the Corpse and Engage in Serious Negotiations</p>
<p>Expanding the Aid Organization and Inviting All Sectors to Participate</p>
<p>The case of the French Concession Western police causing the death of barber worker Gao Yatou has aroused great public outrage in all aspects regarding the French Concession authorities' disregard for human life. The news was collected and recorded yesterday.</p>
<p>Continued Meeting</p>
<p>The Yangzhou Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association held a standing committee meeting at 10:00 AM yesterday to discuss the following matters: (1) Regarding the unclear court examination of Gao Yatou's body, the association has received many letters from members who feel injustice and advocate demanding the court to re-examine it. Therefore, the association has hired three lawyers, Qian, E, and Song, as legal advisors to study the legal procedures. Lawyer Qian will send letters to the French authorities and the court on behalf of the family, demanding re-examination of the corpse. (2) Chen Shounian and Jiao Dingkai, two members of the commission who attended the tragic case, will proceed with negotiations with various groups to expand the organization. (3) Regarding the tragic death of Gao Yatou, the association should issue a declaration based on the points decided by the general assembly and submit it to all agencies and groups to jointly fight for negotiations in order to achieve the goal. In addition, the Barber Association continued to meet at 9:00 AM yesterday to discuss the following matters: (1) Reporting the progress of the Yangzhou Fellow Villagers Association meeting and hiring three lawyers, Qian, E, and Song, to handle the negotiations with Lawyer Wu. (2) Reporting the progress of the organizing committee to various agencies. (3) Nominating Wei Guoyi and Rong Guangren to contact various agencies. (4) Nominating Su Guangdian, Zhu Yaolin, and Dai Kuihong to contact various groups to jointly develop methods for establishing an expanded support association. (5) Sending Yang Jinxi and Zhang Yujin to the family to comfort them. (6) Resolving to continue to meet every day to facilitate the progress.</p>
<p>Joint Assistance</p>
<p>The French Concession Hawkers Union believes that the murderous Western police in the Gao Yatou case will endanger the lives of all hawkers in the future. Therefore, in addition to specially retaining Gao's biological father, Gao Yuanlin, in the association to provide him with food and accommodation, it has also specially hired Lawyer Wu Kaisheng as the legal representative to carry out legal procedures. Yesterday morning, the association's staff accompanied him to Lawyer Wu Kaisheng's residence to sign the power of attorney. Lawyer Wu also sent his assistant Tong Lizhang to receive him. At that time, the corpse's father, Gao Yuanlin, knelt down to Lawyer Wu and begged for assistance, and described the family situation. Lawyer Wu was very touched and promised to contact the French authorities and various agencies on the same day and inquire about the French consul's method of handling the case to appease public anger. Gao's father then thanked him and left.</p>
<p>The French Police</p>
<p>Investigates the Result of Gao Yatou's Death Case</p>
<p>According to news from the French Police yesterday, at 8:00 AM on the 7th of this month, two French and Chinese police officers were on duty in Qianjiatang Village to maintain the peace of the vegetable market there, i.e., to check all the regulations. Several young merchants, seeing the police arrive, immediately fled. Usually, if there are people who run away, they must know that they should be blamed. Therefore, the police pursued them in order to find out why they suddenly fled. However, the merchants fled quickly and disappeared like the Yellow Crane. But one of them, about 15 years old, fell to the ground before being caught up. When the police helped him up, they found that the young merchant had already died. At that time, the French Police immediately ordered a strict investigation of all the circumstances. It was learned that the young merchant, named Gao Yatouzi, was 15 years old and worked as a barber. He was ordered by the owner of the barber shop to go to Qianjia Village to solicit customers. The reason for his escape was not clear. Even if he did not have a license, what he feared was only being fined. However, the French authorities, in order to determine the cause of his death and to know whether the police had acted roughly, ordered a detailed examination of the corpse of the deceased. After the first examination by the doctor, it was proved that there were no signs of being beaten on the body. Furthermore, in order to determine whether the police had committed any violent actions, the French authorities dissected the corpse to examine it. After learning about it, the public prosecutor of the Second Special District Court also wished to have it dissected by the Chinese court. After the French Consul's Office, the French Police, and the court agreed, the date of the dissection was set. At 2:00 PM on May 7th, Dr. Pali represented the French Consul's Office, and the court appointed Dr. Wei Ligong to examine the corpse. Dr. Bo Lush, representing the French Police, and one representative from the court, the French Consul's Office, and the French Police were present. After a detailed and complete dissection of the internal organs and external body parts, no signs of violence or beating were found. However, it was found that Gao Yatouzi had been suffering from lung disease, and the cause of death was heart failure and stopped beating. The three doctors completely agreed on the results of the dissection. Therefore, apart from the cause of death obtained from the dissection, there can be no other objections. Gao Yatouzi ran away because he saw the police patrolling to maintain order in the Qianjiatang market. The results of the investigation and dissection confirmed that running was the cause of death. This incident is very regrettable. However, the patrolling police cannot be held responsible in the slightest for this matter.</p>

<h3 id="e3">Court Ruling Rationale <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>The main points of this case are: (1) Is the defendant Xi Longsheng the plaintiff's biological son? (2) Is the plaintiff's request to have the defendant return to the ancestral lineage reasonable? Regarding the first point, according to the witness Li Ruilin's testimony, the plaintiff was a vegetable-selling woman who had many children. When she was pregnant with Longsheng, she expressed her intention to give him up for adoption. Li Ruilin happened to be a cook in the Xi household and became acquainted with the plaintiff through buying vegetables. Knowing that old Mrs. Xi wanted a grandson, he informed her of the matter and was instructed to fetch the child, falsely telling the plaintiff that the Zhao mansion was adopting him. After taking the child, he lived in a headhunter's home on Rue de Klein. Later, when Xi Eming became seriously ill, old Mrs. Xi ordered Longsheng to be brought into the house to bring good luck, but she did not want anyone to know the truth. She falsely claimed that Longsheng was raised by a concubine of Xi Eming outside." According to the plaintiff's testimony, "When the child was taken away, they said the Zhao family was adopting him. It wasn't until four years ago that I learned he had been adopted by the Xi family." Thus, there is sufficient evidence that the defendant Xi Longsheng is the biological son of the plaintiff, adopted into the Xi household. Although the defendant's agent argued that the plaintiff had given the Xi household a statement on March 29, 1932, stating that Xi Longsheng was born to Xu, the deceased concubine of Xi Eming, and not the plaintiff's son, this argument is not valid. The plaintiff denied the contents of the statement. Moreover, the notary Yuan Huang also testified in the Criminal Court that the lawyer Wu Jingxiong, who notarized the statement, "read each sentence to Huang Zhou and explained it. Huang Zhou was heartbroken, and lawyer Wu comforted her a few times before she signed." The contents of the statement cannot be considered the plaintiff's true intention. Even if it were her true intention, it would still be invalid because it denies the fact of a parent-child relationship, which violates good morals and customs. Furthermore, it was a undisputed fact that the Xi family's friends gave the plaintiff 15,000 yuan when she signed the statement. If the defendant were not the plaintiff's biological son, why would the plaintiff be given such a sum when signing the statement? This statement and the giving of money not only fail to prove that Xi Longsheng is not the plaintiff's son but also serve as strong evidence for the plaintiff's request to confirm that the first defendant is her biological son. Although the defendant's agent argued that the money given was not from the defendant, this argument has not been proven. Even if it were true, it is difficult to say that there is no causal relationship with the parent-child case. Therefore, this point of argument is untenable. The defendant's agent also argued that the defendant Xi Longsheng is now 29 years old, and the plaintiff's request for confirmation is not valid under the statute of limitations. However, the statute of limitations does not apply to family matters. Therefore, it is also difficult to use this as an argument to deny the plaintiff's appeal. As for the second point, according to Article 1081 of the Civil Code, a request to terminate an adoption relationship is limited to cases where one party, either the adoptive parents or the adopted child, has a statutory reason to terminate the adoption relationship. The biological parents cannot directly make such a request. The plaintiff's request to have the first defendant return to the ancestral lineage because she has no descendants and the second defendant already has an heir is not in accordance with the law. Therefore, the court rules as follows based on Article 82 of the Civil Procedure Law.</p>

<p>Lux Soap Star Contest. The movie star contest held by Lux Soap has attracted much attention from the public since its announcement. However, there is still some confusion regarding the procedures for counting votes. According to investigations, the calculation of votes is done entirely using a highly accurate machine, which is also used by the Shanghai Municipal Archives. The decision of the top ten stars will be based on the total number of votes for each person. A test was conducted using 5,000 votes to calculate the top ten stars with the most votes. It was found that no one had selected all ten correctly. Only one ticket selected seven of the top ten stars. This shows that the chance of winning the top prize is very high, and the possibility of multiple winners is very small. If no one selects all ten correctly, the 1,000 yuan top prize will be given to the ticket that selects the most of the top ten stars. For example, if only one ticket selects seven or eight people, that ticket will win the top prize.</p>

<p>Letter</p>
<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>The Jiangnan Zheng Bao newspaper has been publishing advertisements for my company. I do not know what the relationship is. Today, someone sent me a copy of the newspaper dated April 10 of this year, which included a memorial article stating that Lin Zichao gifted the newspaper with the words "崇論閎議" [Lofty theories and broad discussions], Zhang Taiyan bestowed the newspaper with "誼止辭嚴" [Friendship stops, words are strict], and Wu Tiecheng gave the newspaper the words "秉筆盱衡" [Hold the pen and survey the situation]. I do not know if Lin and Wu actually gave such words. However, as for myself, I have not given any such words. It is possible that someone is impersonating me. These days, there are many deceitful and false things. I urge your newspaper to publish this letter to prevent fabrication. Sincerely, Zhang Binglin, May 11.</p>

<p>National Humiliation Week Lecture</p>
<p>Mr. Tao Baichuan Speaks on the Twenty-One Demands</p>
<p>Today is the third National Humiliation Lecture by the Youth Association. They invited me to give the lecture. The significance of holding this lecture is to inspire the patriotism of the people so that the people can have some reference. Therefore, even though I am very shallow, I boldly agreed.</p>
<p>We must know that it has been eighteen years since Japan made its unreasonable Twenty-One Demands. Every year, there is such a memorial day. I think everyone already knows about these Twenty-One Demands because they can be seen in books, and anyone with common knowledge can give a reasonable explanation. But if we want to study them carefully, then, are the Twenty-One Demands that can be seen in ordinary books the same as the actual Twenty-One Demands? Are the Twenty-One Demands from the first to the fifth in the books the Twenty-One Demands proposed by Japan, or are they the Twenty-One Demands that Yuan Shikai agreed to sign? Please think about it, everyone. If these Twenty-One Demands were proposed by Japan, then what were the ones signed by Yuan Shikai? If these Twenty-One Demands were signed by Yuan Shikai, then what were the ones proposed by Japan? Wouldn't that become a question? Originally, these Twenty-One Demands have become a common memorial, but if we study them carefully, they will become extraordinary facts.</p>
<p>The Twenty-One Demands were unreasonably demanded by Japan on January 18, 1915, forcing China to recognize them. The beginning of this matter was in 1914, during the European War. At that time, China did not join the Allied Powers or the Entente Powers, thinking that it could be safe and sound. However, Japan had long harbored ambitions to invade China, and it was always afraid that other countries would interfere, so it did not dare to act rashly. This time, seeing that the European War had begun, it knew that the countries would not have time to take care of the Far East, so it considered the opportunity had arrived. However, it had no way to start a war, so it used the excuse of participating in the war. It notified China on one hand and started a war with Germany in the Jiaoji Railway area on the other. The area from Jiaozhou to Jinan has been devastated. Of course, China did not want this in its heart, but it had no way to do anything and had to watch Japan and Germany use its land as a battlefield. Later, the war stopped, but the Japanese army still did not withdraw. If it was only for fighting Germany, then it should have withdrawn its troops after the ceasefire. Since it refused to withdraw, it was obviously planning something else. When Yuan Shikai saw this situation, he simply couldn't bear it and asked Japan to withdraw its troops. Japan used this as an excuse and angrily made the Twenty-One Demands, forcing our government to recognize them. The content of the Twenty-One Demands is all in the books, divided into five groups. Today, I will talk about them again.</p>
<p>The provisions of the Twenty-One Demands, the first group is entirely about Shandong, divided into four articles. The first article requires the Chinese government to promise the Japanese government that all rights and interests enjoyed by Germany in Shandong based on treaties or other relations must be transferred to Japan. The second article requires the Chinese government to preserve all land and islands within and along the coast of Shandong Province and not to cede or lease them to other countries under any circumstances. The third article requires permission for Japan to build a railway connecting Longkou or Yantai to the Jiaoji Railway. The fourth article requires the Chinese government to allow the major cities in Shandong Province to be opened as commercial ports as soon as possible for the residence and trade of foreigners, and the places to be opened will be agreed upon separately. According to these four articles, almost all of Shandong was unconditionally given to Japan. Therefore, the diplomatic officials at that time, Lu Zhengxiang and Cao Rulin, replied that the first article would be discussed later, the second article seemed uneasy because Germany did not say anything about retaining it, and it was correct to retain it from other countries, but it should be for itself and not for Japan. The third article concerned the construction of railways. It was common to hire foreign engineers for the construction of railways, but the actual power was still in the hands of China. Now, if Japan builds it, wouldn't it completely become a Japanese railway? The fourth was the opening of commercial ports. This kind of behavior was originally done by imperialists, such as consular jurisdiction, so Lu Zhengxiang agreed to discuss it.</p>
<p>The second group concerns various matters in Manchuria and Inner Mongolia, divided into seven articles. (1) The lease term for Lushun Dalian and the term for the South Manchuria and Anfeng Railways shall be extended to ninety-nine years. (2) Japanese citizens may obtain the right to lease or own land needed for building factories for commercial and industrial use or for cultivation in South Manchuria and Eastern Inner Mongolia. (3) Japanese citizens may freely reside and travel in South Manchuria and Inner Mongolia and engage in commerce and industry. (4) Mining rights in South Manchuria and Inner Mongolia shall be granted to Japanese citizens, and the mines to be exploited shall be discussed separately. (5) The Chinese government must obtain the consent of the Japanese government before handling two matters: (a) when allowing other countries to build railways in South Manchuria and Inner Mongolia and borrowing money from other countries; (b) when using various taxes in South Manchuria and Eastern Inner Mongolia as collateral for borrowing money from other countries. (6) The Chinese government must consult with the Japanese government before hiring political, financial, and military advisors and instructors in South Manchuria and Eastern Inner Mongolia. (7) China must entrust the operation of the Jichang Railway to the Japanese government for a period of ninety-nine years from the date of signing this agreement.</p>
<p>The first article in the third group concerns the Hanyeping Company, from articles twelve to thirteen, all for the benefit of Hanyeping. Hanyeping is the largest steel plant, as you all know. Now, for the sake of aggression, Japan has made two articles regarding this matter. (1) The two contracting parties mutually agree that in the future, when there is a suitable opportunity, the Hanyeping Company will be operated as a joint venture between the two countries, and it must be agreed that without Japan's consent, the Chinese government shall not dispose of all rights and interests of the company, nor shall it allow the company to dispose of them arbitrarily. (2) China must agree that no one else shall be allowed to mine near the mines belonging to the Hanyeping Company without the company's consent, and all other measures, whether direct or indirect, that may affect the company must be approved by the company first.</p>
<p>The first article in the fourth group states that China shall not cede or lease coastal ports and islands to other countries. Japan says that this article is for the sake of preserving China's territory, but it is not willing to be against other countries. If it is for the sake of preserving it for Japan, then it is extremely unreasonable!</p>
<p>The first article in the fifth group states that the Central Government of China must hire influential Japanese as political, financial, and military advisors. The second article states that all Japanese hospitals, temples, and schools in the interior of China shall be granted ownership of the land. The third article states that the police in all necessary places shall be jointly operated by China and Japan, or a large number of Japanese shall be hired in the police stations to plan and improve the Chinese police organization. The fourth article states that a certain amount of military equipment shall be purchased from Japan, or a Sino-Japanese joint venture military equipment factory shall be established in China, hiring Japanese technicians and using Japanese materials. The fifth article states that the right to build railways connecting Wuchang and Jiujiang-Nanchang and the railways between Nanchang and Hangzhou and Nanchang-Chaozhou shall be fraudulently given to Japan. The sixth article states that when foreign capital is needed for preparing railways and mines and reorganizing seaports (including shipyards) in Fujian Province, Japan must be consulted first. The seventh article states that Japan has the right to propagate religion in China.</p>
<p>After Japan made the Twenty-One Demands, it did not allow China to announce the treaty to the outside world or allow any modifications. The reason for not allowing the announcement was because it was afraid of causing opposition from various countries, and the United States would definitely not agree. As for not allowing modifications, Lu Zhengxiang, based on his conscience, also hoped to modify it a little because such harsh demands were unprecedented. However, Japan not only refused but also became furious. In addition, this kind of negotiation was not handled in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs but in front of the minister's sickbed. Such a humiliation can be said to have reached its extreme! Japan also knew that Yuan Shikai was planning to become emperor, so it greatly threatened him, and the army and navy advanced together. Yuan was helpless and convened meetings for days, but to no avail.</p>
<p>Although China did not dare to announce it, Japan was so proud that it could not help but leak the news. As a result, various countries questioned it, but China did not dare to say anything. Japan, however, told the whole story. Only the fifth group was not announced because the police power and other issues conflicted too much with the interests of various countries. Therefore, the Twenty-One Demands signed by Yuan later did not include the fifth group.</p>
<p>After the countries learned of this news, although they did not approve of what Japan had done, they did not care because the treaty did not harm them much. Yuan Shikai was also insane and seemed unwilling to fully agree because he knew that he was indeed conquered by his dream of becoming emperor, but his descendants would still be slaves. Later, Japan sent a final ultimatum on May 7, limiting China to respond within twenty-four hours. Yuan Shikai discussed it several times, and the result was surrender. At 6:00 PM on May 9, he informed Japan, generally saying that in order to maintain peace in the East, we would recognize the items you proposed. However, as the fifth group was not announced, could it be excluded? Japan also knew that it could not swallow it alone, so it agreed to cancel the fifth group, but the words "to be negotiated in the future" had to be added to the text. So today is the day of recognition, but the signing was on May 25.</p>
<p>After this news spread, the United States informed China and Japan that if it violated the principle of equal opportunity and open door for the United States in the future, they would absolutely not agree.</p>
<p>The Twenty-One Demands in the books now are the ones proposed by Japan, not the ones recognized by China. What China recognized were the first group regarding Shandong, a total of four articles, and the second group regarding South Manchuria, a total of seven articles, totaling eleven articles. The remaining ten articles were all done through notes. Therefore, the Sino-Japanese tariff treaty in the past was very well-written, with words such as tariff autonomy, etc., but the notes that China gave to Japan were different. Therefore, the tariffs on Japanese cotton cloth and other goods imported into China were particularly low because China had sent a note to Japan stating that Japan should enjoy special benefits. That note expired on May 15, so a certain anti-Japanese association in Nanjing issued a declaration saying that the tariff treaty had expired and should not be renewed in the future. But this is wrong because the treaty has no term limit. What expired was the note, not the treaty. Therefore, Yuan only signed eleven articles, and the rest were lost in the notes. But there is still something worse than the notes, and that is the article that military ports are not allowed to be given to foreigners. Japan ordered the Chinese government to issue an order, nominally to consolidate national defense, but in reality, to preserve it for Japan. As a result, nine notes and one order implicitly recognized these Twenty-One Demands.</p>
<p>After recognizing them, Lu Zhengxiang advocated publishing them, and Cao Rulin advocated not publishing them. As a result, they were indeed not published, so Japan again used the excuse that China was harboring selfish intentions. Later, at the Paris Peace Conference, China took the opportunity to propose that since all countries in the world were being treated equally, why was our country being treated unequally? It requested that the treaty be canceled. However, the chairman did not agree, saying that this was a matter between your two countries and could be negotiated by yourselves without discussing it here. After this disappointment, China again requested a world public judgment at the Washington Conference. After the United States saw it at the time, it also thought it was too much, so it completely canceled three points in the Sino-Japanese treaty, that is, the seven articles in the fifth group, which is from the top five articles to the twenty-first article. However, at that time, Japan's power was slightly lonely, so Japan also voluntarily gave up the cancellation of these seven articles. Also, the point that any borrowing for construction in the three northeastern provinces had to be borrowed from Japan was changed to borrowing from a new banking group. In this way, the United States felt that this treaty was irrelevant to the principles of open door and equal opportunity, so it ignored it. In the end, China had no choice but to ask the recorders of the Washington Conference to reserve the opportunity to raise this case again in the future. This can be said to be extremely pitiful!</p>
<p>Soon. The original twenty-five-year lease term for Lushun Dalian Bay had expired and should have been returned to China, but according to the treaty, it had to be ninety-nine years. At that time, many members of Congress stood up to oppose it, saying that according to law, any signing by the President without the consent of Congress was inconsistent with national law and was invalid. They informed Japan, but as a result, Japan coldly ridiculed them. As for whether to cancel it or not, there was still no clear indication. Therefore, although the Twenty-One Demands were indeed canceled legally because they were invalid, they were not canceled in reality. That is, the May 30th Incident, the September 18th Incident, the January 28th Incident, and even the occupation of Rehe Shanhaiguan, etc., Japan always used the Twenty-One Demands as an excuse, and China itself was also yielding everywhere and still had not abolished this unequal treaty. Therefore, Wilson once said that this is a matter of power, and it is absolutely impossible to succeed by relying on any country. To talk about patriotism or saving the country, you must have power. To have power, you must prepare for ten years and then talk about the issue of revenge. But now, not only has ten years passed, but it has also been eighteen years, and it is only commemorated every year, and the national humiliation has not been washed away. The national humiliations of past years are even heavier, and there is no way to avoid them. This is the most painful point. I deeply hope that all the people of the country will unite and prepare their strength, cooperate with the government to seek to wash away the humiliation, which is also the meaning of our gathering today.

<p>Middle School Joint Sports Meet</p>
<p>Awards Ceremony Held Yesterday</p>
<p>Mayor Wu Personally Awarded Prizes and Shook Hands in Congratulations</p>
<p>Guanghua Affiliated Middle School Won 22 Prizes</p>
<p>The awards ceremony for the second Municipal Middle School Joint Sports Meet, which closed on April 29, was held at 3:00 PM yesterday in the auditorium of the Municipal Education Bureau. Mayor Wu, Director Pan, Xing Wan, a representative from the Municipal Party Department, and over a hundred male and female athletes from the winning schools were present, making for a grand occasion. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Awards Ceremony</p>
<p>Mayor Wu presided over the ceremony. Mayor Wu gave a speech, followed by a speech from Xing Wan, a representative of the Municipal Party Department, and a report from Director Pan of the Municipal Education Bureau. Then, Mayor Wu personally presented the awards and shook hands with the winners. The ceremony ended at around 5:00 PM.</p>
<p>Mayor's Speech</p>
<p>Mayor Wu's speech briefly stated: "Everyone, today is the awards ceremony for the second Municipal Middle School Joint Sports Meet. I said to you during the sports meet that the most important meaning of the sports meet is to annually examine the strength of our people and measure whether that strength can maintain the life of the country and the nation. If we have this strength, we can build the country and resist the enemy. The hope of China is all on you. Your responsibilities are heavy. I hope you will remember this, do your best to be good citizens, and take on the responsibility of saving the country. This is not only my personal hope but also the common hope of the people of the whole country."</p>
<p>Party Department's Speech</p>
<p>Xing Wan, the representative of the Municipal Party Department, said in her speech: "Those of you who are here today to receive awards are the final winners. The victory is entirely due to your competitive spirit. The backwardness of Chinese culture is not because the Chinese people lack a competitive spirit but because the people of the country pay attention to competing for power and wealth and do not pay attention to competing for social and national undertakings. Therefore, my first hope is that you can transfer this competitive spirit to national undertakings. China's national crisis is becoming increasingly urgent. Those who can save the country are all you young people. Therefore, my second hope is that you will strengthen your bodies and strengthen your minds, work hard on social undertakings, and win the biggest championship, so that the Chinese nation can stand tall and realize world harmony."</p>
<p>Director's Report</p>
<p>Director Pan's report briefly stated: "The awards ceremony for the Middle School Joint Sports Meet was originally scheduled to be held on the third day of the competition but was postponed to today due to insufficient calculation. The awards are only to express encouragement and are not the purpose of sports. Therefore, those who win should not be too happy, and those who lose should not be too discouraged. The meaning of sports is to promote universal development. Therefore, in addition to track and field, there are also group exercises this time. Group exercises involve many people working together, which is very important. All schools must pay close attention to this. At the same time, sports records should be updated every year to prove the development of physical education."</p>

<h3 id="e4">Defendant's Argument <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>After being sued, Xi Longsheng also hired two lawyers, Li Zuyu and Qin Liankui, to defend him, stating roughly that Xi Longsheng was born to Madam Xu, a concubine of Xi Eming. After Madam Xu passed away, he was raised by his legal mother, the second defendant (Madam Huang, née Xi). Now that Longsheng is nearly thirty years old, the plaintiff suddenly comes forward, claiming to be his biological mother, and sued Longsheng for abandonment in the Second Special District Court. After the case was heard, the plaintiff realized her claim was false and willingly withdrew the lawsuit. Furthermore, the plaintiff issued a statement declaring that Longsheng was not her son. Unexpectedly, after the case had been closed for a long time, the plaintiff suddenly used the pretext of demanding to be recognized and supported, and publicly defamed Longsheng. Although the first defendant filed a private prosecution with the court, the plaintiff was convicted and sentenced (Note: Madam Huang Zhou was fined thirty yuan and granted a suspended sentence, and Madam Huang Zhou has now appealed. The trial was recently held, and this newspaper has briefly reported on it). The plaintiff then filed this lawsuit in order to obstruct the criminal proceedings. To sum up the evidence she presented, it consists only of the testimony of witness Li Ruilin in the Second Special District Court, and the fact that the plaintiff paid for a settlement. However, Li Ruilin's testimony is contradictory and legally unreliable. Moreover, the plaintiff's statement clearly states that Xi Longsheng is not the plaintiff's son, and Li Ruilin also signed it as a witness, which further proves that his previous testimony was untrue. As for the plaintiff's claim that the defendant paid 15,000 yuan for a settlement, it is also inconsistent with the facts. This money was given by a close friend of the Xi family and cannot be considered a payment from the defendant. Furthermore, the plaintiff's agent's claim that Xi Eming had another adopted son, and that the first defendant Xi Longsheng's appearance closely resembles the plaintiff's, as proof that the plaintiff is the first defendant's biological mother, is purely speculative and far-fetched. As for her claim of blood kinship verification, it is contrary to modern forensic science. In short, the first defendant is not the plaintiff's son. Even if the plaintiff's claim were true, nearly thirty years have passed before she made her claim. According to the statute of limitations, her request cannot be considered legitimate. Therefore, he requests that the original lawsuit be dismissed.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Guan Zhong Should Not Be Overthrown <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>— Zui Chi Sheng</p>
<p>In these times of economic downturn, when people are lamenting "commercial depression," a figure like "Guan Zhong" should truly be revered, not overthrown.</p>
<p>Why? Because "Guan Zhong" was the originator of "prostitution": "Female musicians three hundred, Guan Zhong made Qi prosperous." This is his historical achievement of "establishing brothels and prospering cities." Consequently, the term "prostitution" has continued to this day, generation after generation. Not only do wealthy young men and rich merchants sing his praises and remember this sage, but even the "seventy-two" Yuanxu Publics in the brothels still respect him as a deity and worship him as their patriarch. This shows that his merits are truly indelible. Unexpectedly, some modern moralists are now hanging up the banner of "humanitarianism," advocating the abolition of prostitution as one of their administrative plans, citing its harm to urban civilization. They are carrying this out vigorously everywhere, and the prostitutes in the capital are naturally no exception, resembling homeless dogs. As a result, although public prostitution is banned, private prostitution is rampant. The civilization of the city has not been improved, and the prosperity of the city is declining daily.</p>
<p>Consequently, the gentlemen of the Chamber of Commerce are jumping up and down in anxiety. Feeling the pain deeply, they are holding meetings and submitting petitions to the municipal government, demanding the reopening of prostitution to maintain the economy. On the other hand, the Women's Association also seems to be feeling the pain deeply, and is also petitioning the municipal government to oppose the lifting of the ban. Everyone has their own reasons. This deadlock is causing the esteemed officials to find it "difficult to please everyone." However, in my humble opinion, after careful consideration, it would be better to restore prostitution. First, the suffering of the business community should also be taken into account. To maintain the prosperity of the city, prostitution is indeed necessary. The major cities of the world, such as Paris, New York, and Tokyo, all have thriving prostitution, which is clear evidence. Second, with prostitution, a portion of the bachelors and sexually frustrated men will find sexual release, and scandals can be reduced. Third, at a time when women's careers are still in their infancy, this prevents the prostitutes from wandering around without support. For these reasons, I hope the government will not overthrow "Guan Zhong's policies."</p>
<h3 id="e6">Bad Luck for Antiques <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Yusheng</p>
<p>China is one of the few ancient countries in the world, and ancient countries naturally have many antiques. Therefore, mentioning Chinese antiques inevitably evokes a sense of envy, whether among Chinese or foreigners. Even though China's incompetent descendants are sending them to museums in Europe and America batch after batch for Westerners to display for a long time, and even though the antiques from the Xia, Shang, Zhou, Qin, Han... seventeen or eighteen dynasties are being excavated again and again, it still does not lose its charm as an ancient country, which is worthy of pride.</p>
<p>In recent years, especially this year, the luck of Chinese antiques has been particularly bad. Many antiques passed down from ancestors are being bundled, tied up, and transported back and forth, suffering the "misfortune of being covered in dust." What is most lamentable is that the capitals of Chinese dynasties, such as Luoyang in Henan and Chang'an in Shaanxi, are being excavated everywhere. Foreigners are not excavating enough, so Chinese people are also coming to excavate. In Zhangde, Henan, more than two thousand farmers and workers are treating ancient tombs as their source of food and clothing, and are even earning savings ranging from thirty to several hundred yuan, and they even have the ability to identify treasures inside the tombs (see the Zhangde correspondence in this newspaper on May 9). Although we dare not be so backward as to lament that tomb raiding no longer results in beheadings, from the perspective of the Principle of People's Livelihood, it is a tragic phenomenon that the common people have to rely on "benefits reaching the dry bones" to earn savings ranging from thirty to several hundred yuan!</p>
<p>I am reminded of the most venomous insults in the Jiangzhe area, which often involve the other party's seventeen or eighteen generations of ancestors. I never thought that some of us distant descendants would now be turning our attention to the antiques in the graves of their seventeen or eighteen generations of ancestors. As the people of Suzhou say, "Are you out of luck!"</p>
<h3 id="e7">New Fashion <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>— Baihe</p>
<p>From high collars to low collars, from low collars back to high collars. From large waists and large sleeves to small waists and small sleeves, from small waists and small sleeves back to large waists and large sleeves. From long dresses to short dresses, from short dresses back to long dresses. Women constantly change the length, height, size, and design of their clothes every few days to appear as fashionable and modern women. It is said that a new fashion designer found his grandmother's embroidered silk skirt in the corner of a box, frowned, and had an idea. He cut it shorter and added material, designing a set of new spring fashions for 1933, which was very popular among ladies. It can be seen that the so-called new fashion is nothing more than this kind of trick.</p>
<p>Although I am a country bumpkin just starting out, having neither resided in New York nor roamed around Paris, how can I presume to talk about new fashion design? However, with my discerning eye, I can observe the general trend of new fashions. In these economically depressed times, there is a tendency towards austerity. Look, the waists are narrow, the sleeves are short, there are no linings, the edges are not used, and the linings are only half the length. The cost-cutting is extreme. It can be seen that whoever comes up with a way to save material, this new fashion, in Shanghai, will be popular for at least three hours.</p>
<p>Based on this principle, I have also invented a new fashion that is both novel and economical. When I say it, perhaps everyone will immediately recognize it: it is the jacket style that men wore thirty years ago. For example, the upper part is made of red floral star silk, and the lower part is made of green floral modern crepe. Wearing it and swaying like a willow branch in social settings, you will surely win a round of applause. As for the amount of fabric needed, whether you are a three-hundred-pound fat man, two pieces of four-foot scraps are enough, which is so economical. There is also a trouser suit, which is also worth adopting. Because using a trouser suit is not only economical, but also comfortable and well-fitting, achieving perfection in every way. These are all 1934-style new fashions, and I know that modern young ladies and socialites will definitely adopt them.</p>
<h3 id="e8">The Alarm of the Morning Bell <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>Conscience is innate. Whether wise or foolish, virtuous or unworthy, everyone has some of it hidden in their hearts. Even the most heinous villains sometimes have a moment of realization. From this, we can see that conscience is something everyone has and is not a rare thing. However, the disputes of society, the influence of fame and wealth, and all human desires are in opposition to inherent conscience. The artillery fire of human desires breaks through the defenses of conscience, charging and fighting, and conscience loses its resistance and collapses. Then, rather than blaming people's evildoing on people's sins, it is better to directly and decisively attribute it to the evils of society and the evils of fame and wealth.</p>
<p>Evening drums and morning bells are used in Buddhist temples to announce the time. However, the depth of the evening drum is not as clear as the morning bell. As dawn breaks, all is still. Besides the sound of wind blowing through the leaves and the chirping of birds, all other human sounds are silent. At that moment, the sound of a morning bell suddenly rings out, triggering inspiration and clarity. Conscience is ready to emerge from the heart. Therefore, Du Fu has a line of poetry, saying: "Wanting to wake up, I hear the morning bell, which makes people deeply reflect." That is so accurate! I live at No. 138 Anshun Lane, Shanhai Guan Road, near several temples. Every day at dawn, while I am still dreaming, I am always awakened by the clang of the bells. At this time, as I lie in my warm quilt, everything comes to mind, as if I am on the battlefield in the north, witnessing the soldiers bathing in blood and the brave men sacrificing themselves, fighting the Japanese invaders to the death. At this time, I think that in this critical time of survival, I have neither the strength to contribute wealth nor the courage to kill the enemy. I am still talking about romance, poetry, and elegant pleasures. Wouldn't I be like the merchant girl singing "Flowers in the Courtyard" across the river? Conscience rebukes me, and my hair stands on end. Then, I seem to see my late father, Jinting Public, who passed away nearly twenty years ago. He changes his kind and gentle expression and severely scolds me for being dull and useless, having accomplished nothing in twenty years, and making me live a life of selling my writing and being depressed. I want to cry to him about my worries, but in a flash, he disappears again. Then, suddenly many friends come to my house, all urging me to inquire about the things they entrusted to me last time, and whether there is any progress. I feel that I have been disloyal in planning and have failed my friends. I can only apologize to my friends with shame and sweat. Then...</p>
<p>All of these are illusions performed by conscience. The sound of the bell is like the music in a theater. The music plays a few wonderful tunes first, and then the drama begins.</p>
<p>I deeply wish to cast a huge bell, vibrating in the quiet morning air, so that those traitors, national thieves, villains, and hypocrites, petty people, and shameless people can hear it and be universally warned, which would be effective.</p>

<h3 id="e9">Drafting (Part 2) <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>— Tian Hensheng</p>
<p>Old Man Yang was very embarrassed and asked Dog Girl back, "What do you want me to think of? I'm willing for Little Niu not to go, and I'm even willing to take his place, but I'm old, and they don't want me. What can I do?"</p>
<p>"Isn't Aunt going to think of something too? That's what Aunt said!" Dog Girl pushed Old Man Yang again, with a very anxious look on her face.</p>
<p>"Your aunt only said that Aunt is going to think of something, but that's just wishful thinking. How can there really be a way to think of!"</p>
<p>"I think," Aunt had an idea, "I think, let's go and beg the committee member to draw one less. I'm afraid that would work, right?"</p>
<p>"Who said there was a way! The committee member's words are not wrong either. If he exempts one, he might as well exempt the second and third. Then who do we draw?"</p>
<p>After Old Man Yang said this, he sighed.</p>
<p>So the three people in the room were silent for a while. Dog Girl didn't care about Little Niu anymore, and she got up to go back.</p>
<p>"Like this, wait for me to go to your aunt's house to see if she's thought of anything; you go back first!" Old Man Yang said helplessly.</p>
<p>Dog Girl thought, well, that's all she could do. There was nothing she could say, so she quietly left with a belly full of sadness, resentment, and anxiety!</p>
<p>Old Man Yang also followed out the door. It was already dark, and at ordinary times, there wouldn't be much noise; but not today. Tragic cries from all directions were sent into his ears. There were also people constantly coming and going on the road, and they were all very hurried. When they met each other, they seemed not to know each other, and they had no mood to greet each other; there were also some who were walking and crying along the way, which was even more heartbreaking, turning a quiet village into something like a prison!</p>
<p>When he arrived at Aunt's house, Ah Gui's wife was indeed crying, and Aunt was sitting there worrying. He asked her if she had thought of any way? She just shook her head. After a long while, she said with a bitter face,"</p>
<p>"My head is swollen from knocking! What can I do!"</p>
<p>Old Man Yang couldn't help but feel disappointed! Looking at Ah Gui's expression, he was indeed as if nothing had happened, and he thought to question him in his heart. But then he thought, if he wasn't so calm, what else could he do? So he silently went home. On the way, he unconsciously realized, "I'm afraid that Ah Gui's wife is too overbearing, and Ah Gui has suffered enough, so he's willing to be drafted and leave this shrew!"</p>
<p>That night, Old Man Yang couldn't sleep. Cries from all directions converged into a sharp sword, stabbing straight into his heart. He thought of the horror of war, and the possibility of his daughter becoming a widow. How could that be! His own desolate old age was secondary! So he tossed and turned in bed, enduring the most difficult night of his life. As soon as it dawned, he hurriedly got up. Before long, he and his daughter, whose eyes were swollen from crying, went to see Little Niu off.</p>
<p>The draftees from the whole village formed a team, like escorting a group of cattle and sheep, departing from the village. The families of each person were all crying and following behind to see them off. The escorting people kept forbidding them from crying; but how could they be forbidden! Before Little Niu walked past Old Man Yang and Dog Girl, Dog Girl almost cried and fainted. Old Man Yang was very surprised, and he noticed that Ah Gui was not in this team.</p>
<p>After they passed, and went far away, the families of each person also dispersed. After Old Man Yang escorted his daughter home, he hurried to see Dog Girl's aunt, where he again saw Ah Gui safely at home. Upon asking the reason, it turned out that they had spent five hundred yuan overnight, using two hundred yuan to buy a replacement, and three hundred yuan to influence the committee member, in order to keep Ah Gui here.</p>
<p>Old Man Yang was very frustrated, why didn't he buy a replacement for Little Niu too! But then he thought, in a hurry, where would I get five hundred yuan; the Liu Three Grandfather family isn't good either, and when he married Little Niu, it is said that he still borrowed two hundred yuan. Thinking like this, he was no longer frustrated. But then he worried about his daughter finding out,</p>
<p>resenting that I had a way but didn't think of it for her, continuing to be unclear, then what would be good?</p>

<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Six: Sweet and Bitter Love Affair, Coldly Observing and Commenting on Both Sides, Winding and Rugged Path, Secret Agreement for Three Years</p>
<p>Madam Jiang said: "Alas! These days, raising daughters is always worrying. When it comes to marriage, it's always too high or too low. Besides, this girl of ours has a big temper, and we have to get her consent!" Find us someone appropriate, cousin." Madam Jiang sat by the stove, warming the fire and chatting. Guizhi sat cross-legged on the kang, doing needlework, her face was tight. It seemed that as soon as she heard the matchmaking words, she would get angry instead of being shy. Guan Yaowu stole a glance at her, and decided to say something to test her, so he asked Madam Jiang: "Does my cousin approve of soldiers like us?" Guizhi suddenly twisted her body, and said fiercely: "So barbaric, what's good about soldiers?" Guan Yaowu laughed: "It's not necessarily true that all soldiers are barbaric, is it?" Guizhi didn't say anything, but snorted in her nose. Guan Yaowu pretended not to know, and after sitting and chatting for a while, he left. He knew very well in his heart that his cousin did not approve of Company Commander Zhao. After he left, Madam Jiang couldn't help but grumble a few words to Guizhi. She muttered to herself: "This kind of person is not good, that kind of person is not good, I think you should just stay single." Guizhi said: "My own affairs, I know myself, don't you manage me, managing me is also no good." Madam Jiang said: "I also know what's in your heart. But you have to think carefully yourself. We're still a bit unwilling to be neighbors with people, aren't we, and you're sending yourself into their home, aren't you just going to be kicked out by people?" In this situation, you're still planning to talk about others." These two sentences inevitably pricked Guizhi's heart a few times. Thinking in her heart, this is indeed the truth, what fair words can she use to refute her mother? She had to lower her head, busy with her needlework, and said nothing. However, she was thinking in her heart, what her mother said was not necessarily wrong, people like the Gan family might not be able to tolerate me. But if Gan Jizhi really has feelings for me, he can leave with his brother; we can rent another house to live in, if his brother doesn't want to see me, we just won't meet. Thinking like this, she felt it was reasonable, and at three or four o'clock in the afternoon, knowing that it was the time for Jizhi to come home from the office, she stood waiting at the gate. Seeing him from afar, she greeted him and asked: "Second Master, Happy New Year." (6/7)</p>

<h3 id="e11">Flying Over Walls and Public Education <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>— Bo Fu</p>
<p>In the past, I often saw in the newspapers that young apprentices in shops, or children from good families, in groups of three or five, secretly wanted to go to Mount Emei to learn from the sword immortals and chivalrous people, flying over walls. Recently, I also saw in the newspaper that a certain provincial chairman was spending a lot of money to invite these gentlemen who can fly over walls, strike acupoints, and fly swords to come to the mundane world. Between these two, the difference is that one is going to learn, and the other is inviting them to learn | | just a distinction between going and coming. But on closer inspection, the difference between going and coming is huge.</p>
<p>It is said that in the initial stages of human evolution, everything was based on what was seen with the eyes, and theoretical proof only came with cultural progress to a higher era. Therefore, using theory to prove that dreams are false requires a certain level of education for people to believe. As for people with lower levels of culture, no matter how much you explain, they will still think that the dreams they have personally seen are absolutely true. So, since they have never seen flying over walls, striking acupoints, or flying swords, why do they believe that there are such people? This is the joke that semi-knowledgeable reason is playing. Humans see a number of surprises every day. Natural phenomena and magic tricks can make lower-level people who see them with their own eyes believe them to be absolutely true. And they also have a little semi-knowledgeable understanding, and from this they infer that since these surprises can exist, of course things beyond human power such as flying over walls can also exist, so they believe that there must be such people in the deep mountains and marshes. Therefore, the only way to deal with this kind of incomprehensible superstition is to find a way to show them that there is no such thing.</p>
<p>The children who personally go to seek immortality and visit the Tao will eventually realize the truth, but this is only known to them themselves, and others do not see their results, so they continue to follow in their footsteps. But if you invite these kinds of people to come, people can personally see what the result will be. If there really are people like this, we can make a joke with modern science; if they can't be invited, we can take this opportunity to break the general incomprehensible superstition.</p>
<p>Therefore, the invitation from a certain province this time, in the fact itself, I see nothing to criticize; the problem lies in applying the spirit of this fact. The so-called great difference between going and coming is the difference in application. If the intention of the inviter is really like that of the children seeking immortality and visiting the Tao, believing that there are indeed such people in the world, then... Long live the Republic of China!</p>
<h3 id="e12">"Chinese and Dogs" <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>— Da Wu</p>
<p>Some years ago, there was a Chinese announcement posted at the entrance of the park in the concession, which roughly said: Chinese and dogs are not allowed inside.</p>
<p>At that time, Chinese who were educated were truly "troubled from the moment they learned to read," and could not help but feel insulted and extremely angry. But although they were angry, the Chinese are the most "tolerant," and for many years, they have tolerated being grouped with dogs. Later, I don't know whether it was because the revolution had succeeded and the Chinese had been promoted from slaves to masters, or because of the "Eastward drift of Western winds" and the Chinese had learned some humanism, experimental philosophy, etc. from foreigners, and in the eyes of Westerners they were no longer dog-like, in short, that announcement that everyone considered "regrettable" suddenly disappeared at some point. This matter was then forgotten by people. Nowadays, many high-level Chinese, wearing foreign clothes and shoes, arm in arm with fashionable Western women, go in and out of the parks in the concession sweetly, and few people think that the place used to have an announcement posted saying "Chinese and dogs are not allowed inside." However, have the Chinese really been removed from the dog list, regardless of high or low? This does not seem to be entirely true. Let's take a small matter as an example: It is said that private dog breeding is not allowed in the concession. To keep a dog, you must obtain a permit, otherwise it will be beaten to death. Although thanks to the grace of the Western lords, there is no need to obtain a permit to keep a person in the concession, if a person wants to go a step further, make a living and eat, or do some craft, they still have to obtain a permit, otherwise, they will be beaten to death like a dog. Didn't the Shanghai newspaper report two days ago that a fifteen-year-old barber apprentice, who had not paid for a permit, was afraid of being arrested, "panicked and extremely anxious, unable to stand, and fell to the ground, suffocating and dying"? Was this barber apprentice beaten to death, or did he fall to his death? This is all irrelevant; but because he did not obtain a permit, and was chased like a "dog" that was privately raised, that is undoubtedly the truth.</p>
<p>So, in the concession, although some Chinese have been removed from the dog list, other Chinese, like the barber apprentice, are still afraid of being grouped with dogs! Alas. "The revolution has not yet succeeded, and our compatriots still have to be dogs"!</p>

<p>Olorin (Continued)</p>
<p>Olorin: You want me to be entangled with another woman, that is absolutely impossible.</p>
<p>The Repic Family's: That's exactly what I was about to say. So what now? To be honest, what do you want me to do?</p>
<p>Olorin: We will live like this until I die.</p>
<p>The Repic Family's: When you die! Have you ever thought about this, Olorin? You might outlive all of us, that's what I pray for. Do you think I want to plan until the moment you die?</p>
<p>Olorin: You wouldn't want to kick me out just because I occasionally don't wipe a wine glass dry, would you? Unless you throw me out the door, I won't leave this place. And once I'm thrown out, wouldn't I be forced to starve to death?</p>
<p>The Repic Family's: Who said anything about kicking you out, Olorin? Look how red your face is getting. We were talking very kindly, but you're getting angry and saying such foolish things.</p>
<p>Olorin: Ah! Is it my fault?</p>
<p>The Repic Family's: Then is it my fault? Your eyesight is failing, it's neither your fault nor mine. I hope the doctor can cure you. It's possible. Before you're cured, which of us is in the most difficult situation? You didn't even suspect that your eyes were having problems. And our household chores are feeling the strain. In order to avoid any accidents, I'm giving you a friendly warning, and I seem to have the right to give you a gentle reminder.</p>
<p>Olorin: Remind me as much as you like. Please, don't stand on ceremony. I thought I was already being kicked out; now you've reassured me. On my part, I will wipe the dishes clean from now on, I promise you.</p>
<p>The Repic Family's: Do I ask for anything else? I'm not as bad as the rumors say, Olorin, unless absolutely necessary, I won't dismiss you.</p>
<p>Olorin: Since that's the case, then let's not talk about it anymore. I still feel useful now, and if you drive me away now, I'll have to cry foul. But once I discover that I've become a burden and can't even boil a pot of water, I'll immediately get out of here without anyone having to push me.</p>
<p>The Repic Family's: Don't forget, Olorin, that you can always get a bowl of leftover soup at our house.</p>
<p>Olorin: No, I don't need soup; a little bread is enough. Look how much more fun Mama Mayite has been having since she's only been eating bread.</p>
<p>The Repic Family's: Do you know that she's at least a hundred years old? And do you know something else, Olorin? I can tell you that beggars are happier than all of us.</p>
<p>Olorin: Since you say so yourself, then I'll say the same as you.</p>

<p>Finance</p>
<p>The gold market saw a slight downturn yesterday, with unfavorable overseas news. However, due to limited trading throughout the day, there were no major disturbances. In the early morning, although overseas news showed a decrease in silver prices in England and America, the forward silver price on the Five Metals Exchange rose by 5 hao to 3 li. American cotton also rose by 27 pounds per sound, while the wool market saw a slight decline. The opening price in the morning was 952 yuan, which soon increased to 2 yuan and 7 jiao. Subsequently, the exchange market hardened, and Reuters reported that the US inflation bill had been finally passed by the Senate. Although this caused a slight dip, the market was still able to rally. Later, Reuters reported that the US government would request congressional approval to extend war debt payments, and it was expected that Congress would approve this request. There were also optimistic rumors about Roosevelt and Song Ziwen discussing raising silver prices. This caused a decrease of over 50 yuan. Trading was even lighter in the afternoon, with the exchange market remaining hard, falling to 44 yuan and 6 jiao. There was a slight recovery later on, but unfortunately, the Mumbai market initially rose by 3.2 annas, and then by another 1 anna. Banks showed a greater appetite for supply.

Yi Feng Yong (義豐永, a trading firm) sold continuously, falling to 50 yuan. Small traders raised the price by 2 yuan, allegedly because McAlister Shanghai bought US dollars for August at 1875.

Da Xing Yong (大興永, a trading firm) and Qing Fa Yong (慶發永, a trading firm) continued to sell, breaking down to below 50 yuan.

For merchandise, Heng Yu and others took advantage of the low prices to buy, recovering by 1 yuan and 8 jiao. However, market sentiment was relatively weak, and the exchange market remained quiet.

Rumors in the Securities Market Cause Public Bonds to Fall</p>
<p>The Accumulated Stagnant Situation Has Become a Thing of the Past</p>
<p>A Lively Atmosphere Fills the Market</p>
<p>Yesterday, the atmosphere in the public debt market of the Chinese Securities Exchange was weak, and the market showed signs of fluctuation. Various trading groups tended to sell, especially the 11th series, which was sold most actively. From morning to evening, there were gaps in every trading round. The northern trading group also leaned towards selling. Although a small number of new players were buying, the supply still exceeded the demand. In the afternoon, due to a sudden surge of rumors, the situation worsened. The stagnant situation of the past few days transformed into a lively atmosphere. For example, in the morning's first trading round, the sale of the 11th series of demobilization bonds caused the market price to turn from strong to weak. After that, it gradually weakened, with each falling by a few "jiao." In the second trading round, the 19th series of customs bonds was slightly better by 5 fen or 1 jiao, while the rest continued to fall by a few "jiao." Therefore, although the morning trend was soft, it was still relatively peaceful. In the afternoon, rumors spread that Japanese planes had flown over Peiping, causing panic. The northern trading group sold actively. The extremely stable 18th series of customs bonds suddenly fell by 4 to 5 jiao. In addition, the 11th and 14th series were still being sold, causing even more panic. The market price fell uniformly by another 3 to 4 jiao to more than 6 jiao. Although the decline had not stopped by the closing, it had stabilized by the time of the salt tax auction. The far-term market price actually turned from low to high and did not fall. After the closing, market sentiment stabilized. The final result was a decline of 5 jiao to 1 yuan and 1 jiao and 5 fen. Looking at the overall trend, from morning to evening, each trading round showed a downward trend. The decline was more severe in the afternoon due to the rumors. At the same time, there was a rumor of close cooperation between China and the United States. The total number of transactions was 9,645,000 yuan, including 5,000 yuan in spot goods, 4,425,000 yuan in tariff bonds for the total market, 1,550,000 yuan in demobilization bonds, 1,170,000 yuan in the 19th series of customs bonds, 1,740,000 yuan in the 20th series, and the rest ranging from tens of thousands to 300,000 to 400,000.</p>
<p>New York Stock Prices Rise Sharply</p>
<p>A report from Xin Feng Foreign Firm states that on Wednesday (the 10th), New York stock prices rose sharply due to good news from all sides. Electricity production for the week ending May 6 was 5 per cent higher than in the same period last year, the first such performance in 151 weeks. Steel production, outstanding orders at US Steel, automobile production, and other indicators have all improved, and railway freight is also expected to be good. Therefore, although the US dollar was volatile, speculators bought in actively. The total volume of trading for the day was 3.82 million shares. According to Steel Magazine, steel production rose to 31 per cent this week, mostly purchased by the automobile industry in anticipation of rising car prices.</p>

<p>Yarn and Cotton</p>
<p>Price-Marked Yarn Under Pressure from New Sellers</p>
<p>The yarn market opened relatively stable in the morning due to rising foreign cotton prices. However, due to some long positions being liquidated and some factories selling to lock in profits, prices declined in each trading round. In the afternoon, news of sluggish customer sales made it difficult for the market to recover.</p>
<p>Price-Marked Yarn Declines in Each Trading Round</p>
<p>Most participants in the price-marked yarn market are concerned about low consumption levels. New sellers took advantage of this opportunity to put pressure on prices, leading to a decline of 1.1 yuan to 2.4 yuan. The total volume of trading for the day was 54,000 bales. Hengda sold 750 bales, Tongji 850 bales, Yuda 900 bales, Suilong 850 bales, Mingde 1,950 bales, Lichang 2,000 bales, Yida 1,550 bales, Dachangcheng 1,350 bales, Taichang 1,100 bales, and Yichang 1,900 bales.

<p>Price-Marked Cotton Maintains a Calm Situation</p>
<p>The cotton market opened with an upward trend, but weakened slightly due to the decline in the yarn market. However, sellers did not have large holdings, so the market remained calm.</p>
<p>Zheng's Price-Marked Cotton is Stable</p>
<p>Zheng's price-marked cotton was affected by price-marked yarn, showing a soft trend. However, this month rose by 5 fen, while the remaining months were flat.

<p>Factory Demand is Mediocre</p>
<p>The spot cotton market remains calm. Although foreign cotton prices have risen, factories are suffering from the high cost of cotton and the low price of yarn, so they are hesitant to buy. Shandong American-grown cotton was traded in 200 bales at a price of 46.00 for immediate delivery to the factory.</p>
<p>Tianjin coarse cotton was traded in 24 bales from Dafeng at a price of 37.50.</p>

<p>Silk, Tea, and the Spring Silkworms of Jiangsu and Zhejiang Heard Yesterday</p>
<p>(Suzhou Region) In recent years, farmers have seen the silk cocoon harvest decline, and the silk industry has been deteriorating. The Hushu Pass Women's Sericulture School and the graduates of the Suzhou Agricultural School, both male and female, are now going out to promote sericulture and are willing to serve as guides for raising silkworms. Furthermore, with the establishment of numerous seed production farms selling new and improved varieties at reduced prices, the farmers' interest in raising silkworms has been revived. The Shanren Bridge New Village District has partnered with the Suzhou Agricultural School to raise spring silkworms. The sericulture farmers in the Hengjing Mudu area are also starting to buy seeds and hatch them. Most of the seed prices are charged on account. The hatching of silkworms has been smooth this year. The weather has been good, and the silkworms are developing well. The early batches are already in their second sleep, and the later batches are just starting to open leaves for the first sleep. The latest batches (i.e., those who followed the trend and started raising late silkworms) are just receiving silkworms. The current situation is very good.</p>
<p>(Sheng County) Sericulture in both the northern and southern regions of Sheng County has been depressed due to years of poor silkworm cocoon harvests and loss of capital. This year, the rural economy is even more strained. Farmers lack the funds to purchase seeds. Most of the early silkworms raised using local varieties have been lost due to the cold rain. After the weather cleared and the mulberry trees in the four villages sprouted and flourished, farmers borrowed money to purchase seeds and hatch them. The areas of Ganlin, Chongren, Jiekou, and Huatang are the most active. Jinxi, Pukou, and Houshan are next. The collection of silkworms has been relatively complete. The silkworms are developing well. The early batches are already in their third sleep, and the late batches are starting their third sleep. In about ten days, the new cocoons will be on the market. Unfortunately, no one is inquiring about the market. The number of people renting stalls is very small.</p>
<p>New Green Tea Transactions Still Active</p>
<p>Yesterday, the local foreign firm tea market saw continued strong interest in the new green tea from Sui'an, Wenzhou, and local plantations from the British firm Xiehe Foreign Firm. Yihe, Jinlong, Tianyu, Tongfu, Baochang, and other firms have also followed suit in searching for purchases. The total volume of transactions in the city was 891 boxes of Zhenmei and Zhenmei Needle, and transactions were quite active. Most firms are now inclined to continue searching for purchases, mainly due to the low tea prices, the approaching shipping season, and a situation that is different from last week. It is said that many local plantation factories dispatched personnel to the mountains yesterday to resume the collection of raw tea in order to rush production and sales.</p>
<p>Grain and Food: River Bottom Rice Sales Stagnant, Price Falls Slightly</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday's arrivals were from 30 to 40 numbers, and both wholesale and retail sales continued to be stagnant, leading to a downward trend in market sentiment and a wait-and-see approach. As a result, there were few customers, and even when sellers lowered prices to clear inventory, no one inquired. Therefore, there were few transactions in Su Tong Jing (蘇同粳, a type of rice) and Nangang rice, and prices continued to fall slightly. Although buyers from Qingdao and Tianjin continued to seek to buy thin rice from Qingjiao, Sijing, Songjiang, and West Lian, the volume was only a thousand bags, and the selection was strict, focusing on high-quality goods. The Nanyang gang wanted to buy goods, but ultimately gave up due to unfavorable market prices. The thin rice market declined slightly. Duyangjian (杜洋尖, a type of rice) also continued to drop slightly due to sluggish demand. Yuan rice lacks glory without goods, and Yin rice is soft with a price slightly more than an angle. Also, the Shanghai district bucket, which was previously calibrated by the Social Bureau, has been increased from 6.5 liters to be used uniformly, according to notification.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 25 or 26 boats arrived from various River Bottom areas. The market's flow was sluggish and lacked transactions, causing the market to decline by 1-2 jiao. Thin rice sales were also sluggish, and the price fell slightly. In addition to the slight decline in early rice, Duyangjian declined slightly by 1 jiao, Yangjian was weak by a few fen, Bujian lacked transactions, Kejian was somewhat weak, Yin rice lacked goods, and Bai rice stood firm.</p>
<p>Customer Indica Rice Lacks High-Quality Goods</p>
<p>Fuzhou's Revival Facilitates Purchases... 3,000 Bags Transacted</p>
<p>Customer Goods' Inventory and Arrivals are Both Large... The Market Appears Weak</p>
<p>Yesterday's situation in the foreign customer indica rice market saw active purchases of customer goods again, with the Fuzhou gang returning to the market to facilitate purchases, with a total of over 3,000 bags of Xiang and other rice being transacted. No one inquired about other native customer goods. Customer indica rice's market had turned weak the previous day due to the slowdown of the Fujian gang, but the market turned good again yesterday due to renewed active purchases, which was because the inventory and arrivals were both low. Customer groups were all limiting prices and holding firm. Therefore, once the market cleared, the market improved. However, there was a lot of brown rice and medium-grade customer indica rice in the market, and</p>

<p>— Li Wanju</p>
<p>Those who have not set foot on French soil, or those who have visited Paris briefly and do not understand the inner workings of French society, are often misled by the name "City of Flowers." They only see its extravagant exterior and imagine, even conclude, that most French women are gluttonous and lazy, love to dance, love to dress flamboyantly, and live a romantic life of extreme luxury. In fact, this observation and publicity are very wrong and very arbitrary. It is true that some French women live a life of dissipation, but these are a minority of the minority. The majority of women have long realized that "modern" women demand the extension of women's rights and should strive for economic independence within possible limits. They know that the value of life, worthy of respect, lies in labor and self-reliance. They know that work is not only not a shameful thing but also a thing worth boasting about. The famous 19th-century socialist Proudhon said, "A moral person is a working person," so he said, "Those who do not want to work should not eat." Most modern French women have this concept in their minds.</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the war, strong men went to the front lines to win glory for their country, leaving only the old and weak who could not work. As a result, all public institutions in France at that time, such as post offices, customs, banks, as well as shops, companies, or factories, fell into the hands of women. In addition to going out to work every day, they also had to deal with household chores when they returned home. At the same time, many women risked great danger to go to the front lines to take care of wounded soldiers. This was the contribution of French women to their country during the European War!</p>
<p>The number of women who occupy a position in the French academic world is certainly not as large as that of men. However, as far as the University of Paris, where I have been going in and out for many years, is concerned, the eagerness of female students (of course, some of them are foreign women) in class is really rare. Stepping into the library, it is also often the case that there are more girls than boys. Many of these female students, in addition to going to school to study every day, also have to help their mothers manage household affairs when they return home.</p>
<p>Middle-class families in France usually do not hire maids. All household chores are entirely handled by the housewife herself. These housewives, although they dress up coquettishly when they go out, work like blacks at home, washing the kitchen clean and wiping the floor smooth and shiny. They are definitely not like Chinese women, who hire maids and nannies when their husbands earn fifty yuan a month, while they themselves eat their fill all day long and "play mahjong" for entertainment.</p>
<p>Writing this, I cannot help but think of a French philosopher from the early 19th century, Joseph de Maistre. In the autumn of 1808, he wrote two letters to his daughter, Miss Constance, discussing women's education. In his first letter, he said: "The merit of women lies in managing the family, making their husbands happy, comforting husbands, encouraging husbands, and educating children..." In his second letter, he said: "...Fénelon said that women can do everything that men do, etc. This is flattery to beautiful women, or it is foolishness. Because the fact is exactly the opposite. Women have never done anything great in any aspect. ...If an educated girl, a gentle, simple, and sincere girl, can make the children she raises like her, this is the greatest work in the world..."</p>
<p>Maistre's words are naturally very outdated, extremely biased, and not suitable for the modern trend. However, the fact that managing the home is a woman's natural duty is undeniable. Beauty is human nature, and we do not object to women dressing up, but we hope that women do not forget their responsibilities. We believe that women's rights should be improved and women's education should be popularized, but we hope that women realize that so-called "modernization" means being more progressive and working harder than their predecessors, rather than just dressing up and dancing to be called "modern."</p>
<h3 id="e15">Doctor <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Heng</p>
<p>Doctor, this sacred profession, once fascinated me in my youth; so when I was about to enter university and choose courses, I was determined to enter medical school, although that never materialized. The fervor of youth made me see the ideal doctor as a savior, without thinking that in this era of commercialization, it is also one of the methods of making a profit.</p>
<p>"Doctors also have to live!" When Zhi Luo was able to repeat this sentence in his heart, it was already when the illusions of youth were gradually extinguished and he was often meeting with the ugly reality.</p>
<p>Secondly, the doctor, this sacred savior, not only gradually lost his brilliance but also showed me the ugliest face.</p>
<p>Traditional Chinese medicine, although I have never had any faith in it, I do not hate it in any way. I first learned that in Chinese feudal society, there are such hateful doctors, as if I only realized it after reading Mr. Lu Xun's "Father's Illness." Mr. Lu Xun has carved a picture of a traditional Chinese medicine doctor for mankind here. That picture, because of the author's meticulous art, because of the shocking event itself, will permanently exist in the hearts of mankind!</p>
<p>Western medicine, because of my several friends who suffered from lung disease, made me familiar with the faces of various doctors. Those faces are such that people dare not be affectionate. As soon as I see them, I want to say: "Thank God, you gave me a healthy body!"</p>
<p>An old friend, probably due to heredity, had suffered from severe lung disease since he was nine years old. Whenever it was an emergency, whether it was in the middle of the night or at dawn, he would go to knock on the doctor's door. The doctor gave him a brief examination, kept a fearful distance from his gasping, casually prescribed a few common medicines, and quietly announced the death sentence of the child to his relatives. However, this child did not die as quickly as the doctor judged. Continuing his intermittent gasping, he was always able to overcome the danger and live again.</p>
<p>But this kind of living is unfortunate. Every year in the spring and autumn seasons, he always had to suffer a great disaster. The doctor, whom he had not trusted for a long time, still had to knock on the doctor's door in the critical middle of the night. For an extra medical fee, the doctor would come, but from his acquisition, it was only that same old face of disgust and the announcement of the death penalty. Once, his illness even frightened the doctor into revealing such a face: "With your kind of illness, you still come to bother me!" Then, without saying anything, he brushed his hand away and left! 丨 Doctors were not saviors after all!</p>
<p>However, no matter what, he still lived in the world. In the end, he did not even knock on the doctor's door anymore and no longer looked at that hateful face. No matter how critical the situation, he would prescribe a prescription for himself. Every time after escaping from death, he would triumphantly tell us: "Prolonged illness makes a good doctor! With so much experience, I will not die at the hands of a doctor in the future!" He is already twenty-six years old this year. Although he has gone through countless death sentences announced by countless doctors, he is still alive in the world.</p>
<p>There was another friend who also suffered from lung disease and eventually died in the hospital of one of the most famous lung disease specialists in Tokyo. I watched him gasp his last breath. At that time, I was the only one accompanying that lonely soul who died in a foreign country.</p>
<p>For more than a year, he slept in the hospital of the unique lung disease specialist in Japan, who enjoyed a world reputation. That medical scholar, I do not want to mention his name, was like a little emperor in his own hospital. He was not willing to see patients much. Everything was taught to his disciples. Patients became the guinea pigs of these disciples. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e16">All Chinese People Can Rest Assured <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>— Hou Ying</p>
<p>Ever since the Japanese invaded our country, the cry for national salvation has arisen, so loud that it has almost filled our ears. To sum up, there was resistance to Japan and national salvation, dancing for national salvation, entertainment for national salvation, followed by champagne for national salvation, jade faces for national salvation, and even the recent aviation for national salvation, etc., which can almost reach the clouds and connect to hell. The whole country is filled with cries for national salvation. How grand! However, taking a look with open eyes, those who have succeeded in saving the country, except for dancing, movies, champagne... etc., which have the nature of entertainment and making a fortune, have rarely had perfect results.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is because the Japanese bandits have seized Jehol again and broken through the Great Wall that the land of rites and righteousness, which once produced great sages, has had to advocate "abandoning learning to save the country." Success or failure may not be counted, but the great name has long been spread throughout the country. From then on, another record has been added to the "history of national salvation," grand and justifiable. However, from what the humble one sees, the gentlemen do not need to spend so much effort. The reason is that although our China is "increasingly in danger," their small island country is also "on the verge of destruction." Please do not worry, readers, and see the following telegram:</p>
<p>According to a Tokyo dispatch from this newspaper on the 29th, "The area around Fukagawa in this city has sunk one foot in two years. It is the opinion that other areas, such as Asakusa, Shitaya, Kanda, Nihonbashi, Kyobashi, Kojimachi, and Hongo, have also sunk two meters or fifteen 'seis' in the past two years....The lowest land in Tokyo is the two districts of Honjo and Fukagawa, which are two meters above sea level. The higher Nihonbashi and Kyobashi are about four or five meters, but according to the current situation, they are gradually sinking. In the future, all buildings will sink to the bottom of the sea. At present, the people of Tokyo are extremely panicked." Amitabha! I can imagine that in the near future, we will be able to see the Japanese dwarfs sinking into the Crystal Palace on the island. At that time, we will be clapping and cheering in the air, looking through telescopes and sitting in Ford machines. Compared with now hastily preparing airplanes to fight the Japanese, there is a world of difference. Let us all dance and celebrate in advance. From then on, China will be as solid as "Mount Tai"! However, if the dwarfs have too many lumps in their bellies and move all their people and property to China before the three islands sink into the sea, then what can you do about them? This humble one is not clever and will answer for the contemporary era: "At this time, there will naturally be a way to resist Japan. The brilliant plan is all in a 'history of national salvation'? Now, let's enjoy ourselves and not worry. There will be an explanation in the next episode!"</p>

<p>— Si Yuan</p>
<p>A young man who has never been in society always harbors great extravagant hopes for the future. Imagining future happiness may increase the motivation for current life, leading to the spirit of making persistent efforts to seek the pleasure after realization. In an era of calm objective environment, perhaps it can satisfy a small part of the expectations. In the current crisis, personal concepts are too high, and the pain of frustration is even greater.</p>
<p>The progress of the entire life history must be established with predetermined goals so as not to regret the tedium of life and the contradiction of the shape of consciousness. When we carefully consider everything and decide on our destination, the prospect of the future and the facts of the present must naturally be experienced and criticized from many aspects to obtain correct conclusions, plus past experience, to enrich deeper conviction.</p>
<p>Steel-like facts are presented before us. The complete country's foundation is gradually shaking, and the society is experiencing layers of morbidity. The future results give us the question of where to go, erecting a tall road sign. We cannot hesitate or avoid it in the future. We must shake off the sharpness of our whole body to meet the current needs. Before embarking on a new route, it is necessary to completely liquidate the past way of life. This can not only strengthen the determination of the future but also allow us to have lessons of reflection.</p>
<p>In the achievements of the twenty-two-year revolution, the autocratic regime was abolished, and the democratic government had a period of history, but it still did not satisfy the expression of the desires of the general public. The people should bear the responsibility for their own defects. The government, without the backing of the people, is ultimately very empty and cannot build everything. It is necessary for people to abandon their responsibilities because of the people, and they will hold high positions and refuse to work hard for the people.</p>
<p>The existing mistakes have formed the current serious situation. The people are the power of all forces. They must supervise the government and encourage the government. They must always pay attention to the trends of the world and explore the mistakes of the government in order to fulfill the responsibility of the people to save the country. The attitude of standing by and not interfering in politics must be completely eliminated. Now is not the era when you can retreat to the mountains and live a quiet life to end your life. When the country reaches the stage of peril, a quiet life has become an impossible method.</p>
<p>Important people are not saints who are superior to everything. They also often have wrong actions. Serving the people is their duty to abide by. The masters have forgotten their due status and regard them as noble guests until disaster is imminent, and they feel that they have been used. Being incautious in the beginning is really very dangerous.</p>
<p>Everyone has family ties, and everyone wants a happy family. Chinese people are even more rich in this concept, as if a person's entire life exists for the family, wanting to obtain a good position and rich income in order to obtain the laughter of their parents and achieve a comfortable life for the whole family. The country, society, and compatriots do not directly affect the safety of the family, and it seems that they can be allowed to develop naturally.</p>
<p>The vicious poison that has been passed down for thousands of years still maintains considerable power today. The so-called family is indeed an important small group, and life always depends on it. However, the era has come to sacrifice one's own happiness in order to open up the path to survival for the entire nation and save the survival of the masses. It is not the time to shrink in a small area and enjoy peace and happiness! To preserve the entire life and build the future stability of the family, we can only abandon the current narrow scope. Because the family itself cannot withstand the destruction of bombs and cannons!</p>
<p>The encounters of the elders in the Northeast may not come to our heads. Losing all freedom, separated from wives and children, living like this, the spirit is simply equivalent to death. The family suffers the same fate. The collapse of the entire society means that the family cannot exist alone. We love the survival of society and should love it twice as much as we love the family!</p>
<p>Many young people spend a lot of capital and walk the path of self-destruction. Slippery (covered with Ketankang) suits, dressing themselves as beautiful as angels, what is the purpose after all? Do you think it's beautiful and noble? As long as a person has a little common sense, they will feel the baseness of this kind of consciousness. In the vast sea of ​​people, there are richer men and more beautiful girls than you, so there is nothing beautiful and noble. Is life comfortable? As long as the nerves are not numb, close your eyes and think about the current situation, disasters, and hunger and cold, forming a phenomenon of social bankruptcy. You cannot exist apart from society, and the morbidity of society will always affect</p>

<p>Fine wine and women, Western-style houses and cars, are all enough to depress one's will. I have also thought about getting promoted and making a fortune, and enjoying life. But reality clearly tells those who make these beautiful dreams that rough giant hands are already striking the country's head. Suffering is about to descend on everyone's surroundings. At this moment, we need to work hard and struggle to open up the survival of the nation from a state of hardship and difficulty!</p>
<p>Wouldn't domestic cloth clothes also keep out the cold? All daily necessities take care of the vitality of our country. Don't let the rights and interests overflow, and it will not reduce the pleasure of survival!</p>
<p>Friends! Throw away our old way of life and embark on national salvation,</p>
<h3 id="e20">A Special Announcement <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Min</p>
<p>I passed by the vicinity of Xuejiabang in the South City the day before yesterday. On the wall of a small alley, I saw a special announcement. I couldn't help but be curious. I stood still. It took me a minute. I read it from beginning to end. Because it was full of misspelled words, I copied the words of this announcement and sent them to this magazine for free publicity. In the middle of this announcement, it is written the four big characters "Specializing in Fire Dan". The small characters on both sides are very misspelled. I, who am uneducated, could not read it. I will now copy the original text without changing a word as follows:</p>
<p>This doctor specializes in old Fire Dan feet. Clear inside, yellow, mysterious. Ji Du. Xia Gan. Xiao Chang Qi. Huang Zhong. Fruit. Qi Guo. Cheap tooth worms. Eye fresh. Children Tang Lang Zi. Red Oil Wind. Acute Man Jing Wind. That is, bone enters Kai. Covering Nian Xin Jing Gao Huang Jing. Acting as a vegetarian Buddhist service. Fake star worship Dou. Everything is complete. The price is negotiable. If interested, please go to Jiabi Lane and ask Zi A Yuan to cooperate. Special announcement.</p>
<p>Shanghai, known as a civilized metropolis, is truly full of wonders. This is the first time I have seen an announcement like this, which combines internal medicine, surgery, pediatrics, trauma, Buddhism, and Taoism.</p>
<h3 id="e21">Overcoat <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Ye</p>
<p>The overcoat has become an indispensable garment for women in today's cities. Except for the hot summer, it is useful in the spring sunshine, the autumn air, and when the north wind howls. In the cold winter, walking on the road, it is not enough to keep out the cold without it. It is warmer indoors, so you can take it off at will: putting it on and taking it off is very convenient. In the spring and autumn, when it is suddenly cold and suddenly warm, it is also indispensable to add or subtract clothes at any time to suit the body. However, its greatest function lies elsewhere, that is, when entering and exiting social occasions, if there is no overcoat, the curled hair, long eyebrows, red lips, and powdered cheeks will be dimmed. With it, it will add to its charm and show its extravagance. The use of the overcoat is great!</p>
<p>Yesterday, a friend was marrying his wife, and I and my neighbor, Miss Mou, were invited to attend the grand ceremony. At two o'clock in the afternoon, I went to ask her to go with me. She said: Sir! I'm not going, please convey my apologies to the host for not being able to attend the celebration. I said: You and the host have more than a casual relationship, how can you not go to participate? Then she sighed and said: A spring overcoat has not been made yet, how can I go to the public? The winter overcoat is out of date, it's not that I don't want to go, but I can't go. I tried to persuade her but failed, so I went alone.</p>
<p>When I got there, among the many female guests, I saw that everyone was wearing an overcoat over their thin spring shirts, except for the old women and young girls. At this time, I forgave my neighbor's bitterness in not being able to attend her friend's wedding. Later, I saw a lady with curled hair and leather shoes wearing an ill-fitting overcoat, whose demeanor was still a bit unnatural. She looked familiar. I closed my eyes and thought. She turned out to be A Qiao. She is a fifteen or sixteen-year-old girl who helps her parents with the tofu business at home every day. Washing rice, washing vegetables, and dumping the toilet are all her jobs. Rough and thick-legged, according to her qualifications, curled hair and leather shoes are already too much, and an overcoat is even more beyond her means. However, she came to this public place today, mingling among many flamboyant women, and actually wore the overcoat that is indispensable for women in today's cities, looking around proudly. Except for her unnatural behavior, who would know that she is a girl who "has never known the fragrance of silk and satin from a humble family." Since A Qiao also wears an overcoat, I should forgive my neighbor even more for not attending this wedding.</p>
<p>Three or four years ago, there was a group in the educational circles of Shanghai. There were about 300 to 400 people at the first general meeting, of which 80 to 90 were women. Only one woman with a 足愧 松眉 and who often served as the chairman wore an overcoat. She stood on the stage, one hand in her pocket, the other hand rising and falling, her attitude was really wonderful. At the second general meeting, more than one female member wore an overcoat. Spring after spring, autumn after autumn, the years have passed year after year, and the female members' clothes have also increased at each meeting. In the end, those who did not wear overcoats were rare. It seems that wearing an overcoat is one of the qualifications for women to join the association.</p>
<p>In a certain family in the city, a husband and wife became estranged over an overcoat, and eventually hired a lawyer to handle a divorce lawsuit. The matter was that the husband wanted his wife to go to Hangzhou with him, but the wife refused to go because she did not have an overcoat. The husband insisted that she go and refused to add an overcoat for her. The wife said that she would leave as soon as the overcoat was made. Under such a stalemate, Hangzhou could not be reached after all, and from then on, the good husband and wife became strangers, and finally faced each other in court, and the swallows flew away.</p>
<p>The overcoat has become an indispensable thing for urban women. Lucky, the child of the era! Overcoat!</p>
<h3 id="e22">Dragon Flower Pagoda <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Geng</p>
<p>In this enchanting third month, when peach blossoms blush the face and willow hues stain garments with green, everyone should steal a moment from their busy lives to visit the Longhua Temple and ascend the Longhua Pagoda, said to have been built by Sun Quan, the ruler of Wu. There, one can reflect and appreciate the surroundings.</p>
<p>Upon the pagoda, what strikes us is that on the walls of each level, there are countless sentences, either carved with foreign knives, written with ink brushes, or scribbled with pencils, such as "So-and-so was here," "So-and-so and So-and-so came here for a visit," or "So-and-so's travel team has been here." They are mostly the same, and it's truly a dazzling display on the walls. I don't blame those who wrote them for damaging public property, because it's their curiosity that drives them. Their intention is simply to inform those who climb the pagoda that they have been here. But in the near future, when the pagoda is repaired, all these traces of "So-and-so" and "So-and-so" having been here will be covered with white.  Save the nation, save the nation, save the nation, save the nation...</p>
<p>Only the sound of footsteps on the stairs, no one coming up.</p>
<p>The white powder has been applied, covering up traces of shame! I think of our North China now. The newspapers tell us that So-and-so has established a puppet state in So-and-so in the So-and-so month on the So-and-so day; So-and-so troops have advanced to So-and-so, intending to launch a general attack on So-and-so's troops; So-and-so troops have occupied So-and-so, and several So-and-so planes have bombed So-and-so. Ah, these traces of extraordinary humiliation and shame are left on our territory, left in our history, increasing without end! When will these traces be erased? Will they disappear on their own, or must we use force to eliminate them? Our people should all ask ourselves, think deeply in the quiet of the night!</p>
<p>Let's All Examine Our Lives - Zhi Qin</p>
<p>Whether a person's life is good or not is greatly related to society. Therefore, we must improve society and reform politics. Our own lives should not only be meaningful but also valuable. To achieve a life that is both meaningful and valuable, we must have ambition, especially to do more work that benefits society and the people. However, the lives that most people are currently living are extremely boring. They consider one day as two and a half days, and apart from eating, dressing, and enjoying personal happiness, they are generally ignorant of other things. This kind of personal life that only knows oneself and not others misunderstands the meaning of being human.</p>
<p>The bodies we are endowed with are not meant to simply eat a few bowls of rice and wear out a few pieces of clothing; they are meant to be used to strengthen our muscles and use our wisdom to transform society and renew the nation. The soundness of society must be maintained by the strength of the masses. If political ills cannot be corrected by individual efforts, then the power of the masses should be united to reform them. One cannot abandon one's due responsibilities because of the adversity of the environment or the lack of qualifications, and instead adopt a passive attitude of indifference, allowing them to act recklessly. This is absolutely wrong.</p>
<p>Our country has created the current state of decline and gloom because those who eat do not work, and those who speak do not act. Everyone lives an irresponsible personal life. Therefore, to save the country from danger and reform politics, we must first correct the lives of each individual before there is a solution. Now that things have come to this, do not complain that the government is not fighting for a way out for the people, nor should you scold the Japanese devils for being too deceitful. We should examine whether the lives we are living are wrong and whether there are contradictions in our words and deeds. Please check yourselves first before you speak again.</p>
<p>Clerk's Correspondence</p>
<p>Going Back to the Countryside</p>
<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>I am an apprentice in a small tobacco shop and will be completing my apprenticeship at the end of this year. However, I have absolutely no interest in this line of work. Furthermore, I have no good relatives or friends to help me find a better position. Seeing that there is no hope in the business world, I want to change course and find a bright future for myself.</p>
<p>My family originally lived in the countryside and made a living by farming for generations. When I was young, because my health was not very good, I studied for a few years and came to the city, abandoning farming to learn business. Now, my health has improved, but there is no hope for development in the business world, so I really want to go back and inherit my family's ancestral profession. However, after telling my family about this idea, I received a letter from them the day before yesterday saying, "Life in the countryside is not easy either!"</p>
<p>Sir, is it better to pursue business or farming? What is the path for pursuing business? Can farming support a living? Will going back to farm be ridiculed? Please advise me one by one. With best regards,</p>
<p>Respectfully, Cao Yu</p>
<p>X X X X</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Society is a whole, and agriculture, commerce, industry, academia, and politics are interconnected. Cao Jun is in the business world and only knows that there is no hope in the business world; however, the phrase "life in the countryside is not easy either!" is also true. Our bright future is to be sought through "effort." Simply changing directions will inevitably lead to disappointment. For example, a person suffering from insomnia cannot fall asleep by sleeping on their left side, but how can they fall asleep by sleeping on their right side? The current recessionary society is like a person suffering from insomnia. If it is not fundamentally treated, no matter what you do, you cannot have a peaceful life! So, you ask, "Is it better to pursue business or farming?" Our answer is: "Both are good" or "Both are not good." Whether you pursue business or farming, there will be no ready-made peaceful days waiting for you. Your future must be obtained through struggle. However, to bring it back: the objects of struggle in the business world are entirely "cunning, sharp, and ruthless" "people": the objects of struggle for farmers, although inevitably there are also "landlords" and other types of murderous, fearless "people," but at least there are rice, millet, beans, wheat, sorghum, horses, cattle, sheep, chickens, pigs, etc., a type of things that won't do cunning things. The more labor you put in, the more you can get in return. Cao Jun, since your personality is not suited to the business world, then, if you're going to suffer anyway, go to the countryside! As for whether you will be ridiculed, we must know that "using one's own labor to earn one's own food is equally glorious; who cares what others say!"</p>

<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Seven. Fragments of Life, Part Two</p>
<p>The virgin's pride was completely destroyed in an instant.</p>
<p>Master Zhang had probably taken his place here for three nights, and later came every one or two days. According to him, his own wife always loved to ask questions persistently. He felt that being a husband was really very troublesome, while she was able to relax.</p>
<p>Another month passed, and Master Zhang rarely came. But Miss Liu's bracelets and necklaces were always so dazzling. All her companions secretly envied her: "That green jade is so lovely!"</p>
<p>It was night again, and it was raining heavily outside, making it terribly cold.</p>
<p>Probably because she had been entertaining guests every night for the past few days, she was not feeling well, and her waist was very sore. She thought about hiding somewhere for a few days.</p>
<p>The violent rain beat against the glass window. She leaned lazily against the window, looking at the raindrops splattering on the window frame.</p>
<p>Suddenly, she heard her name being called in the hall. It was the voice of the rickshaw puller:</p>
<p>"Miss Liu, hurry up and get dressed, you have a call!"</p>
<p>Another call, it was really going to kill her. She ran angrily to the door and shouted:</p>
<p>"I'm not going, it's so annoying."</p>
<p>This outburst was no small matter. A stiff face immediately turned out from the side, and two piercing eyes were fixed on Miss Liu's face. At this time, Miss Liu wisely put on a forced smile and said coquettishly:</p>
<p>"Mama, I don't want to go today, my head..."</p>
<p>"Hmph, when do you ever want to go? How dare you say that? Do you think you can go whenever you want and not go whenever you don't want to?"</p>
<p>There was no way out, she had to turn back to her room to change clothes, otherwise, she would be scolded again. She reluctantly sat in the car.</p>
<p>Two hours later, she returned in the car, drunk and feeling even more heavy-headed. She couldn't forget the flippant behavior she had endured in the restaurant. Originally, this was very common, but today she felt particularly sad. She didn't want to drink, but she was forced to drink, and had to drink for others. She drank alcohol and smoked, smoked and drank alcohol. She put on a smiling face and fed food to the men she hated. She smiled, a sad smile, a crazy smile, and then secretly cried. She sang opera, singing with a hoarse voice, each sound bursting out as if a knife was cutting her throat. However, she had to keep singing, singing one piece and then another. In the end, she really couldn't sing anymore. The veins in her temples bulged and lines of tears hung in her eyes, but she was slapped heavily by a customer, who then jumped up and down, shouting:</p>
<p>"I spent a dollar, not to see you cry, you motherfucker!"</p>
<p>The cold wind came through the rickshaw hood, and even her bones were cold, which was of course because she had drunk too much. Later, the car stopped in front of her door, and she heard Wu Gui tell her at the door:</p>
<p>"That Master Zhang is waiting for you again."</p>

<h3 id="e24">How Did Films Really Begin? (Part 2) <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Weng</p>
<p>Here is a more accurate answer!</p>
<p>My father was originally very wealthy, but because of his research on films, he became impoverished and even had lawsuits due to debt. When he died on May 5, 1921, he was still giving a speech at a meeting of film merchants!</p>
<p>My father was very worried about finding a suitable flexible film. He knew that glass could not be used as the base material for motion picture photography. It was not until 1888 that he invented a camera that could use a roll of easily photosensitive paper material, about fifty feet long, to take continuous films. He used this camera to take street scenes of Brighton. Later, this film became powerful evidence in the lawsuit with Edison in the American court over patent rights. My father had been to the United States once in 1900 for this matter. This lawsuit proved that my father was the first inventor of the motion picture camera.</p>
<p>However, the paper film was easily damaged, so artificial ivory became a substitute for glass plates. In Birmingham, there was an artificial ivory factory manager named Barker. My father went to discuss it with him, and the two of them worked together on research. It was not until the second camera was invented that it was possible to take photos with artificial ivory wax plates. This camera is the one known as the "microscope" camera. In January 1889, my father used wax plates to take motion pictures for the first time, a scene of Hyde Park. This film was also sent to the American court as evidence against Edison.</p>
<p>Later, research gradually progressed, and all the difficult problems were gradually solved. On June 21, 1889, my father, with the help of the engineer Evans, obtained a patent for a motion picture camera. This day can also be said to be the birth of the first motion picture camera. Although the world does not know the details of this matter, newspapers at the time had records of it, which can be proven. He spent 10,000 pounds to test it, and in 1891, he sold his property and everything to take care of debts, but he did not feel any pain.</p>
<p>He also invented color film. In 1903, when I was only five years old, he took a picture of me in the garden of our house. All the red and white colors on my body were vividly displayed. He died at the age of sixty-five. Didn't I tell you that he died at a meeting of film merchants? When two policemen carried him to the morgue, they found only one shilling and ten pennies in his pocket. This was all the property he left behind. This little money would probably only be enough to buy a movie ticket!</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3 id="e25">Review of "Blood Letter" <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Nan</p>
<p>Let's first talk about the story of this film: A girl lives with her brother and sister-in-law. The girl's lover has gone to his hometown to raise money for their wedding. Her brother and sister-in-law, greedy for the betrothal gifts of another playboy, insist on marrying her off to him. She is forced to run away. Her sister-in-law secretly lives with the playboy. Coincidentally, the girl's lover has already returned and accuses the playboy. As a result, the girl's sister-in-law and the playboy both die. The girl's brother and lover flee for their lives. On the way, they stay in a small hotel and find out that the owner is the girl's uncle. It turns out that the girl had also come to the hotel and attempted suicide. She was recognized by her uncle, so everyone was reunited.</p>
<p>The lighting is too bad, sometimes bright and sometimes dark. The photographer has no control, and some movements are shaky and blurred.</p>
<p>If there are any highlights, then it is only the big fight scene, which can make people with low tastes cheer for a while! The subtitles this time are acceptable.</p>
<p>The technical loopholes in this film are not impossible to fix; it is just that the director is too careless. Knowing that the actors' facial makeup and performances cannot be seen up close, he insists on using countless close-ups. Many places are written too hastily, and it is absolutely impossible to express what should be expressed in the play. Disconnections and inconsistencies could all have been avoided, but in reality, there are very many. Let me list a few points:</p>
<p>What is the girl's family background? Are they rich? If they are, why do they care about these betrothal gifts? Why are there no servants in the house? If they are not rich, how can they live without anyone working (the brother is a vagrant)? Why do they have such a big house to live in? The girl runs away and is tricked by her sister-in-law to the playboy's house. Is the girl stupid? How can she know nothing about her sister-in-law's personality? The young man came on foot to say goodbye, how can there be a big horse waiting for him when he goes back? How come the playboy's mansion is burned down and he immediately has another mansion? Does he already have two residences? When the girl comes to the hotel, she passes by acquaintances face to face, penniless. Does she intend to commit suicide as soon as she arrives at the hotel? Then why does she ask the waiter for directions? The playboy is killed, shots are fired, how can no one know? How come there are no servants or patrols? (The script has a line "Family members came out one after another")... Ah, it is really hard to describe everything on paper.</p>
<p>I hope that the Yueming Company will work hard in the future!</p>

<p>— Manzai</p>
<p>These two big clowns came to Shanghai, arousing a lot of interest among Chinese and Western people in Shanghai. Film companies, dance halls, and cafes all take pride in their arrival, because they are so clownish and must cause a sensation, attracting everyone to come and admire them, so business will be unusually prosperous. It is said that on the ninth, Wheeler and Woolsey suddenly got excited and started learning to pull rickshaws, and the beginners pulled very skillfully, which really surprised the onlookers. But I don't know if the rickshaw pullers in all of Shanghai know that these two American comedians are competing with you.</p>
<h3 id="e27">Review of "Grounds for Divorce" HIS GROUNDS FOR DIVORCE <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>After watching the movie advertisements, I knew that "Grounds for Divorce" was also a UFA production. Perhaps because the impressions it gave me in its production were relatively profound, at least I was satisfied that it was different from American films, so I bought a ticket and entered the theater with great hope. But when the screen showed EAD starting to walk out of the theater, I couldn't help but gasp. Therefore, I cannot help but doubt my past fascination with UFA.</p>
<p>We may as well first talk about the plot. A manager quarrels with his wife over trivial matters, even to the point of divorce. Afterwards, he falls in love with a young girl, spending a lot of trouble and "money," and finally gets married. (Of course, this is not that simple in the middle, but there is no need to copy the instruction manual.) The whole thing is somewhat mocking of women's vanity, the ingenuity of rich people buying love, and dissatisfaction with the childishness of the law. But in terms of the plot itself, it is inevitably too coincidental and close to nonsense. The most obvious thing is that the former Minister of Justice did not allow them to marry, so they insisted on saying: This Minister of Justice has stepped down, and the new one happens to be the manager's private legal advisor, who can of course greatly abuse his power for personal gain, and the marriage is a great success. However, there are also some commendable points, that is, the process of a young girl loving money and fame to the point of marriage, the screenwriter can be regarded as describing it quite carefully.</p>
<p>Just in terms of the plot, it is really shallow and boring. Fortunately, the director worked hard to make progress, relatively depicting the joy of young people and the joy of gentlemen, and paying special attention to every satirical scene. However, he could not make up for the weaknesses of the plot. Although he did not increase the exposure of the weaknesses, at best he only made the content more vivid. And there are few laughs, which are unnatural, but not as exaggerated as most American films.</p>
<p>The performance is not good, and the lighting is not as good as previous works.</p>

<p>— Yuan Yuan</p>
<p>Under the guidance of Shao Zuiweng, the Tianyi Company basketball team practices diligently at the prescribed time on weekdays, so its progress is exceptionally rapid. In recent days, it has had friendly matches with the Qingnian Hui Qingyou Team, the Datong University Blue and White Team, and the Guangzhao Yuexiong Team, with both sides having wins and losses. Yesterday, the Tianyi team was invited by the China Middle School basketball team to compete at the company's basketball court. The game started at 4:10 pm and ended at 5:10 pm. As a result, the score was 28 to 19, with Tianyi winning. During the game, dozens of male and female students from China Middle School came to the venue to cheer. All the male and female actors of Tianyi also came to the venue. Whenever a ball was thrown in, everyone cheered and jumped, as if they had won champagne. It is heard that tomorrow is the date for the match between Tianyi and the Quanzhang Middle School of this city. It is expected that there will be another great tearing and killing. (Que Chou)</p>

<p>The Shanghai Youth Association has always spared no effort in developing intellectual education and promoting legitimate entertainment. Now, in order to provide members with a good place for entertainment, the association has arranged for sound movies to be screened at the Youth Association in Baxianqiao every Saturday at 3:00 pm and 5:00 pm. The films shown are the latest productions from Paramount, and they contribute to social education. It is heard that the film to be screened this Saturday (the 13th) is "Niang Zi Jun" (The Women's Army).</p>
<h3 id="e30">Jeanette MacDonald Really Abandoned Hollywood <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Fen</p>
<p>The people in Hollywood expected it</p>
<p>After Jeanette MacDonald went to Europe, Hollywood said that she was going to marry her fiancé, and others said that she was going to travel. After MacDonald left, Chevalier remained in Hollywood, co-starring in films with other partners, and left MacDonald alone, as if he would no longer partner with MacDonald in the future. So, even more people in Hollywood expected that MacDonald would not return to Hollywood this time. Although some said it was not necessarily so, MacDonald's past works, such as "The Love Parade," had a very good impression in the minds of Europeans, so she had the possibility of gaining a foothold in Europe.</p>
<p>As expected, the people in Hollywood expected it. MacDonald did not get married in Europe, nor did she intend to travel. Now, the definite news has come that MacDonald has already started working on the screen in Europe. Her first European production is a "Queen" THE QUEEN, which is now half-finished. Her second one has also been decided, which is called "Trouble in Heaven" TROUBLE IN HEAVEN. The male lead has also been agreed upon, and it is Herbert Marshall, a famous figure in the British film and theater industry, who is also a Hollywood star who recently went to Europe, so MacDonald's abandonment of Hollywood has become a reality.</p>

<p>The atom of peace is produced from the course of struggle. Therefore, the object of peace is not cowardice. The new Youlian film "Flower of Peace," which will be released at the Central Grand Theater, reveals the subtle meaning of resisting when life is subjected to intolerable insults in a humorous way.</p>
<p>The Rose Girl in the film is a great sacrificial savior and leader. She is able to overcome dangers and hardships, and tirelessly drive out a large number of invaders. She slowly restores the rural areas that have been trampled by iron hooves. This kind of achievement is really great! Movie star Xu Qinfang has been away from everyone for a long time. This time, her performance on the screen will surely be satisfactory. (Que Chou)</p>
<h3 id="e32">Henry Garat Meets His Wife <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>— Kang Bing</p>
<p>It Came Without Any Effort</p>
<p>Henry Garat has now become the male stereotype recognized by French and German women. He is now in Hollywood. Below is his own story of how he met his current wife.</p>
<p>He said, "This is the most coincidental thing. Just when I was on vacation in the south of Nice, I suddenly received a telegram calling me to immediately return to Germany, where I had filmed many films. I immediately set off, and on the train, because I was anxious to return to Germany, I didn't bother to admire the scenery of Paris along the way."</p>
<p>"Because I was not wealthy, I only gave the train attendant fifty francs, and a woman in the same car also gave him only fifty francs. There was only one seat left on the train, next to that woman. It is rare in France for two strangers of the opposite sex to sit together. I waited, but this young girl did not give way at all. Later, I found out that she was the artist Betty Rowe. I started chatting with her and asked her to make some room."</p>
<p>"In this way," Henry continued, "we talked all night. And our love began. After I hurriedly returned to Berlin, I came back and married her."</p>

<p>— Cairo</p>
<p>Because Mary didn't like to hear unlucky things, she quickly agreed, "Yes, yes, I understand."</p>
<p>Just as Dr. McGoffin was about to leave, John returned. Because McGoffin saw the look of surprise on John's face, he didn't want to immediately tell him about his son's condition, and asked, "Didn't you catch Red-Faced Jack?"</p>
<p>"His brother and two others were caught by us," John said, his eyes fixed on little John's face. "Beaufort?" McGoffin shook his head and sighed. "This is a mess. Jack cherishes Beaufort as if he were his own life. I fear this is the harbinger of a terrible battle."</p>
<p>John quickly pulled McGoffin aside and discussed with him, "If something unexpected happens to me, can you find a way to send her and little John to New England?"</p>
<p>McGoffin silently nodded, saying, "John, entrust this to me, and I will definitely take care of it for you." They shook hands solemnly. John saw the doctor off, then he and Mary watched little John smile, and they were delighted. Suddenly, they heard the sound of rapid hoofbeats. John ran to the door and looked out. It was Shen Xiang. He hurriedly dismounted and shouted as he came in, "Jack and a large group of people are coming! I saw them; they'll be here in a moment!"</p>
<p>John instructed Mary to go to the bedroom and not move. He and Shen Xiang used orange trees to block the door. It was already late at night, and the wilderness was silent, but in the stillness, the sound of hooves could be heard, galloping from afar.</p>
<p>As soon as they arrived, they fired a shot at the door. Jack shouted for John Carden to come out and talk. John heard Jack declare that if he didn't come out, they would break down the door and kill everyone, big and small. So, for the safety of Mary and little John, he wanted to go out and fight him. Just as he was about to pull open the barricade and go out, Mary stopped him, not letting him go out. She said she would rather die together; otherwise, if John died, she could not live alone. So, a shootout started inside and outside. At this time, Mary had already placed little John on the small bed in the bedroom, covered him with a blanket, and she joined the battle, specializing in loading bullets for Shen Xiang and John. Jack and his gang bombarded for a long time, but still couldn't break in. They then found a large piece of wood, and several of them carried it to ram the door. John's house was made of wood, so when it was hit by such a large piece of wood, it creaked as if it were about to collapse. In the midst of this extremely critical situation, a faint cry came from the bedroom. Mary heard it and quickly ran in. She picked up little John. He seemed to be asleep; she kissed his face and touched his hand. Why was it so cold? She became frightened. She turned around, grabbed a mirror, and placed it on little John's mouth, but there was still no moisture. He was dead! Mary stood there as if turned to wood, and with the battle outside urgent, she forgot about dying as well. (To be continued)</p>
