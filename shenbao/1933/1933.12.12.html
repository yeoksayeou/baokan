<h3>時評　治黄與疏濬河道愼</h3>
<p>黄河自大禹疏濬九河之後。即少有人具正確这理解。周定王五年河失故道南徙。戰國時諸侯則競築堤防。未嘗計及天下後世之利害。於是溝渠愈壞。漢代以後。衝决時聞。泛溢乃無寗日。因此開化最早地質甚厚之北部各省區。遂日處於苟安之局而無由自拔。且後世之爲政者。雖在統一承平之際。亦祗知一時之安富尊榮。絶鮮顧及國家民族之福利。民間則限於財力。又不敢作越位之言。因之溝渠失修。地質不加培養。而農民乃愈困憊矣。</p>
<p>吾人試循行冀晉豫諸省區。爲粗略之觀察。即可審知北方各省水患之由來。第一。主要河道在秋汎之後。即行乾涸。如汾河如滹沱上游。冬令僅留河床。幾同大道。已完全失其歸納水流之作用。第二。北方若干大城市如太原等。城廂附近。雖有河流。然從未聞加以疏濬。一旦淫雨襲來。則低窪街道。即成澤國。因之災荒迭興。泛濫不息。第三。北方各省多爲沙土之冲積。冀魯豫三省。爲尤顯著。故凡河流皆帶泥沙。到處停滯。一任天然之變演。絶少人工之彌補。甚至常加堵塞。積滯愈多。泛濫乃愈甚。有此三者。黄河之水患。遂愈演愈烈矣。</p>
<p>惟於國力疲敞民力困窮之今日而言治黄。未免爲紙上空談。無補事實。近聞河南建設廳擬疏濬五河道。經財部函致經濟委員會。以爲旣資灌溉。又利農航。且變更土質。間接助長鹽務税收。將由水利工程師實地勘察。不久或將見諸實施。且惠濟河原爲豫東南之主要河流。淤塞而後。灌溉之效用旣失。尤易招致水災。爲害農業。頃者豫省當局已着手疏濬。其工作已及百分之七十。指顧之間。即可令惠濟與賈魯兩河相溝通。行見乾渴已久之河道。將重獲灌溉之利於農田也。不過就黄河大堤安置虹吸管。其力甚微。水量亦小。以事灌溉。恐不免爲杯水車薪。若欲爲航運計。更須有鉅大之水量也。是故疏通溝渠。誠屬善舉。而黄河之分部修濬。尤爲急需。否則一旦大河横流。僅恃此一小支脈之疏濬。寗足以當大難耶。</p>
<p>至於衛河。原爲黄河古道九道之一。黄河本流。在今武陟。合沁水而去衛輝。東北流經山東之臨清。過天津。循白河以入海。衛輝在今日。猶可舟行。自此以上則漸淤塞。沁水且轉入黄河。失其水利。現在河南省政府。雖曾計及衛河之疏濬。但尚未聞着手開導也。吾人默察當前情勢。爲長治久安計。導黄入衛。誠最得策。旣分黄河横流之勢。又增衛水枯渴之源。所應注意者。惟黄河堤岸應如何切開。如何修築水閘耳。</p>
<p>就交通論。隋唐宋三朝之水運。南賴通濟渠。北依永濟渠。皆溝通黄河。南至淮。北達渤海。其於商旅之調劑。官貨之輸運。實與有大力焉。近者鐵道漸次發達。國家對此。未必視爲急切之需要。但於地方之補助。則爲益甚巨。緣治黄之舉。消極目的在乎救災。使水患不致再度爲害。而積極目標。則爲改正歷史上之錯失。便利航運。猶居次要。而改良北方各省之土壞。復興農業。實爲要圖。是以河南省疏濬五河。其實惠範圍。雖甚狹小。如能繼續努力。即不難爲治黄之艱鉅工程開其端也。</p>

<p>（倫敦）關於歐洲軍備問題、最近英國表示允許德國一部分重整軍備、但另一方面、英國政府主張由德國與其各鄰邦訂立互不侵犯條　、資保障、但欲使法國獲得滿意、對於德國一部分重整軍備不再表示反對、則僅恃互不侵犯條約之保障殊有未足、而軍縮公約中之監察相織實當加以特别重視、蓋此項恊定、倘欲求其切實有效而爲有關各方面所接受、則必須設立嚴密之監察制度、方能使法國方面有所慰藉而安心也、聞希特勒總理表示接受英相麥唐納之軍縮計畫原案、（按該案係本年三月十六日在日内瓦所提出、主張法國軍隊限四十五萬、意國軍隊限二十五萬、德國依凡爾賽條約限制軍隊限十萬人、以後可增至二十萬人、但本年九十月間、英法美三國在倫敦巴黎　　後、英國將麥唐納計畫加以修改、於十月間提出日内瓦、　國即因此退出軍縮會議、）麥唐納之軍縮計畫原案中、主張對於監察制度之保障加以澈底研究、托雖麥唐納原案對於如何研究監察制度、未有確切之規定、要之、監察制度如能實施則此種保障、其　助於和平、不遜於互不侵犯條約、此層固爲麥唐納原案所承認、此種計畫、欲謀實施、至今尚伏重重之難關、一般人知之甚諗但柏林方面所表示之態度、當不致反對將監察問題重加研究、因此倫敦方面認爲英政府已命駐德大使斐律魄於下次覲見希特勒時、要求將此項問題提出討論云、麥唐納首相之機關報新聞通信報、頃載一文、題爲（解决軍縮問題之一新企圖）其所指示之方法頗關重要、殊有加以介紹之必要、該報略猬、軍縮問題今又麥唐納原案爲討論之基礎矣、麥唐納原案包含軍縮監察常任委員會之一章（即原案第五章、）該章内應加入一項、規定將軍事行動中最必　之鑛産物列成一表、而加以監察、其監察方法應根據簽約各國現在商業上之需要、以定此類鑛産物之分配額、其辦法與麻醉品公妁規定、依照現在麻醉品之醫藥上需要、以决定各國分配額、正屬相同、至於未簽字公約之國家、即凡不願受常設委員會監察省、則不能獲得依照該國商業需要之比例分配、蓋因未簽約之國家、不能保證其分配所得鑛産物之用途故也、此種監察制度之實施、應依照麻醉品公約之實施方法、在各簽約國國内、設特許專賣制度以加限制、在國際方面、則設一中央監察局、各簽約國須常期向該局提出關於販賣軍用鑛産物之報告、若是則目前軍用鑛産物輸入及輸出統計之異常狀態、不難洞明、而軍用鑛産物之秘密供給、亦無法隠滿矣、此外並可施用搜查權、以免私運、所幸鑛産物不若麻醉品之易於藏匿、故此種監察制度、必較麻醉品之監察易於收效、惟此項問題向爲一般人所忽略、目前實有加以審議之必要云、（按月前國報紙載罄、加拿大所産之鎳輸入德國、一年來數額倍增、鎳係製造軍用品之所必需、故英國報紙以此爲德國秘密擴張軍備之證、新聞通信報所提出之主張、或即因此所引起、亦未可知、）（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>德國新國會選舉結果（歐洲通訊）列山</h3>
<p>十一月十一日下午七時、德國總統興登堡將軍作了一次這回選舉殿軍的演説、對于這回希特勒黨的獲得多數票、也不無意義的、他的演詞、雖然簡短、但却很有力、他是以完全贊助希特勒的態度來勸告德國人民投贊成票、并且許多地方、還替希特勒的行動、加以註解、並加證明、興登堡出身貴族、在各方面威望甚孚、特别是貴族軍諭及農民方面、以這些人爲中心的德國國家黨（現已解散）、顯然聽命于興氏、平常這些人、是絶對反對希特勒的、假如你碰到一個貴族青年、你問他是否希特勒是黨員時、他一定會很鄙夷的哼了一聲、然後告訴你、他是個王族的血統、决不會變成希特勒黨徒的、興氏的解釋、對于這批人自然發生効力、因爲他也説、此次國會選舉與人民票决、是關係于德國將來的整個命運、到了十一日夜間、一切顯然格外的緊張、街道上堆滿了行人、但好像總缺乏點什麽似的嚴肅到幾乎有極忙碌的神氣、雖然大家還老是走來走去、國社黨方面、因爲是最後的一夜、自然更加緊宣傳、不過一般的意見、總覺得全部事情早就决定了的、對于宣傳、顯然並無若何濃厚的興趣此次選舉、除了國社黨黨部、並官方竭力鼓吹外、人民團體方面、亦由各團體領袖發出宣言、并通告等等、例如天主教·基督教·工會農民團體·文化團體·等、所説的話、大部分都大致相同、力伸這回事件的嚴重性而已、加之反對黨缺乏宣傳之機會、國外的情狀、又十分隔膜、大部分人民、至此就無法辯别了、其次、前皇威廉第二的第四王子、威廉奥古斯特、此則是希黨要人之一、他在漢堡曾公開的説、此次誰投了反對票的話、我們一定要他尋出來、當作犯人看待、這就很可以嚇壞了一部分反對派胆小些的人、自然不敢輕易加以嘗試了、再次在小城市并鄉村中、反對派員絶不敢活動、結果反對派的力量、德國選民總數　四五·一四六·二七七人參加國會選舉　四二·九九五·七一八　參加人民票决人數　四三·四六○·五二九選舉國社黨票　三九·六四六·二七三　贊成票　四○·六○九·二四三無効票　三·三四九·四四五　反對票　二·一○一·○○四註：此表數目照官方第二次更正數目、與第一日之佈告微有出入、　無効票　七五○·二八二在國會選舉、國社黨獲票百分之九十以上、在人民票决方面贊成票還更多些、不過這結果、國内國外却都不覺得奇怪、因爲事勢所必然、至于參加人民票决人數、爲什麽比國會選舉還要多些、這就因爲許多國家黨人并中間派、雖然不贊成希特勒、却更憎恨法國人、希特勒説、人民票决是對付法國的、于是乎他們相信了、就特别參加來投票、</p>
<p>新國會議員選出六百六十人、有一點最受人家諷笑的、就是旣用民主政治的方式來選舉、而選民却不知道他的一票所選的是誰、并且大部分議員部是平素未聞名）的人、除了極少數的部長并實業家政治家是例外、將這一批新議員分折起來、此中大約有五十名左右是現任部長及各省區的行政長官、有四十名左右是較高級及中級的官吏、工人代表、大約也有四十名左右、農民代表却比工人要佔多數手工業工人、也有四十名左右的名額、工商業界資方代表、大約佔有二百名數目、自然以上人物十分之九都是國社黨黨員的、其餘的名額、都是國社黨少年衝鋒隊、銅盔團各地方的領袖、新國會有兩種特點、青年人數目增大與没有女議員參加、希特勒對于婦女素來歧視、年來賢妻良母的提倡、更不遺餘力、此次新國會婦女的被排斥、就是他主張的一種表現、</p>
<p>自然、此次選舉的經過、正如國社黨所預料的一議、當局不用説、會心滿意足而興高彩烈了、選舉後的第二天、希特勒卽發出兩宣言、一告人民、一告國社黨員、大意自然是很高傲的叙述他感謝之意因爲德國人民、已一致的在他指導之下了、同日國社黨有名的政論家議森堡、在民族觀察報上著論、結論是（希特勒就是德國）、他解釋此次選舉巨大的收獲、已公告全世界、德國人民已與他的領袖希特勒完全一致了、其餘各報態度也相彷彿、都是異口同聲的道賀此次的成續、特别是對于外方面、認爲是有歷史上的重大意義的、同時宣傳部長哥白爾最受各方的讚美、因爲大家都歸功于他的宣傳得力、此外、興登堡總統向希特勒道賀、巴本代表全體閣員向希特勒道賀、此日希特勒的地位、事實上已不讓于莫索列尼的在意大利了、</p>
<p>其實、自從國社黨執政以來、希特勒已有極鞏固的地位、國會旣通過四年信任案于先、一切政黨又被毁于後、何必又多此一舉、到底此次選舉的意義何在呢、不單德國報紙不肯説出原因來、就是其他歐洲各國的報紙也大部分不加以明白的叙述、據各方猜測、有下列二種主要的原因、其一、就是希特勒所發行的預約劵過多、外交方面又束手無策、不退出國聨、國内發生問題、退出國聨、外交又馬上嚴重起來、所以採取一面退出國聨舉行選舉、以統一國内、一面力用和平的口號、以遮掩對法的讓步、關和内外的空氣另一原因、就是法德國間無法消滅的對立、遲早總要爆發、法國最近旣進一步、將奥國拉在另一面去、于是就想乘機根本上對付希特勒、打算設法運動南德國之拜揚巴登等省脱離普魯士、而與奥國合併、另成立一德奥聨邦、因此事很有些可能性、因爲拜揚巴登等地的人民、無論在宗教上只剩下大城市的一部分了、這批人包括社會主義者、（一部分社會民主黨員、同一部分共産黨黨員、）自由主義者（一部分中央黨黨員、及其他小政黨黨員）并一些貴族、希特勒雖然形式上把各黨統一了、但事實上以前各黨的基本羣衆、直到現在止、似仍無法感化、所以希特勒對工人説、你們中間還有反對我的好、我就着手教育你們的子女、幾年以後、這批少年兒童、就是國家社會黨的青年黨員了、那時候、他們會自動的反對他們父母的見解、</p>
<p>十二日選舉的日子終于來到了、早晨希特勒黨的軍樂隊、就到處遊行、自從十日希特勒在柏林西門子工廠演説時、全國各地各式人家的窗口上所掛着的國旗·黨旗·就過宿了兩夜、一直到了這一天、依然還在飄揚着、九時以前、各選舉塲前面已是人山人海、九時一過、選舉開始了、選民是肩背相接、排成了一長蛇陣、但大家顯然都很緘默、每個選民在投票的時候、還得另購一枚由政府所特製的徽章、文曰、贊成、旁另註一行、一九三三年十一月十二日字樣、爲的大家都買來掛在襟上、于是也就没有人敢于不破費這一筆錢了、徽章的價格、説定五分、但人人起碼都給了三倍以上、當天選民總數達四千三百餘萬就是説、這一天德國政府的收入、也幾乎近于千萬元了、自然也是一筆生意經、</p>
<p>選舉一直延至下午六時始停止、除了極少數人以外、大部分扶老携幼、爭先恐後、國社黨的權力、在這次選舉中、已給德國人民深深的認識了、此日已經没有一個人敢哼一個不）字了、否則單嘗鐵窗風味、還算便宜、</p>
<p>當日下午七時後、就將各地選舉的結果、陸續用無線電話報告、許多咖啡館無不坐滿着、靜聽消息的顧客、生意自然百倍、直到深夜一時始完畢、此次國會選舉、并人民票决、結果如下、·歷史上·習慣上·與奥國反較之與普魯士爲接近、（註）南德國與奥大國大部分人民信仰天主教、並魯士則信仰基督教、尤其近來希特勒扶植基督教、舉動上常與天主教衝突、法國正可乘機進行、使德國分裂、根本削弱希特勒的勢力、所以人家説、德政府的人民票决辦法、就是對法國的計劃一個答復、因之、興登堡總統演説最後的一句是喊着、德國人民團結起來、自然、這一幕劇也正在開始、希特勒正着手採取强有力的中央集權制、以期先發制人、不過、大體上、對于希特勒不利的成分較多、因爲法國最後是不惜用軍事來解决的、否則、除非希特勒屈服到使他滿意新選舉以後、各國的輿論、當然也同平常一樣加以攻擊與諷刺、法國外長彭古、更高唱强硬的論調、英國又重提軍縮會議、希望德國就範、德國的前途、到底往何處去、此日誰都不敢預言、但德國民間的空氣、顯然有深重的憂慮、恐怕將來法國軍隊又要光顧到萊茵河一帶、一九三五年、歐洲大約不會再安靖的、</p>
<p>我們以中國人的地位來觀察、希特勒的主張、是另外一回事、暫可不論、但他爲民族求解放的精神、與破幹死幹的一股勇氣、就足使我們欽敬的了、（十四日深夜。歐陸）</p>

<h3>假使人可以不死</h3>
<p>— 庸子</p>
<p>假使人可以生老病而不死，雖然白刄過頸、而　會像孫悟空般的砍掉了一個腦袋，再從腔子襄仲出一個腦袋來，那慶，我想這個世界上，定比現在的世界，還要好玩幾百倍。</p>
<p>了一世的英雄，到頸不免於一坏黄土埋英骨，這雖不長於兒女之情的英雄，也不免於氣短。假使人可以不死，那麽每一個英雄，儘可造一個時勢。好在不列入於英雄之羣的衆生氓庶，在五百磅炸彈之下，也没有性命的危險，所以也不用躭憂着犧牲，而儘可高枕而眠，或高坐在高頂上，瞪大着眼看厮殺，對着造時勢的英雄，喝采呌好。</p>
<p>愛國有心，救亡無術的熱血青年，往往懷着已失戀的情人的照片而跳海，或同熱戀的情人，在旅館裏，緊閉着房門，吞服安眠藥。在這慈航道人，尚未做到普渡衆生的時代，青年懷着一腔義憤，無路請纓的時候，惟有以了此殘生爲出路。但若人類眞可以不死，自殺之路走不通，那麽，留此一般熱血青年在世，怕不更把這世界點綴得熱閙麽。</p>
<p>人還逃不出死亡線。而據民間的傳説，死後總跳不出鐵面無私的　羅天子的掌握，於是給予了一般勇於爲惡者以一個重大打擊，而不敢不留些兒飯給予孫吃。若是人生字典中，没有死字，那麽，大家鈎心門角，欺詐奸邪，一切罪大惡極的勾當，儘可放膽地做去，那不知現在這個世界，已進步到了怎樣的局面。</p>
<p>無奈上帝所造的人，都是不免一死的，所以上面所説的，實際上部是廢話。但是雖然説廢話，廢話也得説回來。假使人可以不死，那麽，英雄没命地造時勢，奸佞之輩，僅着作惡多端，衆生氓庶，求死不得，更覺可憐。熱血青年，跳海不沉，吞藥不死，曁着一肚子悶氣，活着，也乏味。所以人還是會死的好。</p>
<h3>渡頭之歌</h3>
<p>— 陳亮</p>
<p>江河是世界；船艙是我的家，摇着，摇着，瞬息兒梅花開哪。花開，花落，花結子，船大姐兒幾時配人家？摇着，摇着，呌聲我的媽！女兒長的這麽長－又這麽大啦。）……　　江濱，初冬的季節。可仍是那麽暖洋洋地，十月裏小陽春，柔和的南風吹拂着。渡頭停靠了幾條渡船，船大姐兒依着那支櫓若有所思地唱着，唱着。但，一回兒又停住啦，抬起腦袋兒來望望天空，一簇一簇棉絮般的白雲推動着。那長鳴的雁羣，（人）和（一）字的陣列，打雲端裏横了過去，越高遠越渺小，一粒粒黑芝麻似的－消逝了。</p>
<p>消逝了，寳貝般的青春。</p>
<p>雁兒們明春仍要飛回來的。</p>
<p>青春，青春呵，它是一去不復返。</p>
<p>瞧人家成對兒地，而自家老這麽守着孤獨。眞猜不透娘親的心思。怕不成要把女兒留在船上做一世船大姐？别家女兒就該那樣好福氣。小小年紀做媳啦。</p>
<p>這麽地想着，抑鬱和煩悶在心裏充溢着，身子感到刺熱，臉龐上飛起兩朶紅雲－。</p>
<p>紅雲，在那隔住水天的弧線上面。晚霞的光芒。不知不覺又是薄暮，瞧鳥兒結伴歸巢。給南風吹皺了的銀灰色的江面。渡船上已載着客地的游子－飽經風霜的孤獨者渡江。爲生活，大家都是：都是…。在船梢上，伊又輕輕地唱啦。</p>
<h3>西施和花瓶</h3>

<h3>東北四連长</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第二十回　卜吉有期老人連日笑　剷愁不盡舊雨對門居</p>
<p>江氏看這情形，料着他是睡着了無疑，便不再問好歹了。就伸手到枕頭下面去探索着，看看究竟有什麽東西。手上感觸着有些異乎平常了，就一手揑定，完全掏了出來。見桂枝依然睡熟，就輕輕的放了大步，走到外面這間屋子裏來。再看手上的東西，是一本連環圖畫小説，幾張字紙，一張相片。相片上一個半身小影，認得清楚，乃是甘二爺。這影子年紀是越發的輕了，然而紙料却變作了黄色，這分明不是現在的相片了。心裏這就想着，我倒不料這個丫頭，心裏還是惦記姓甘的。這相片不知道是以前送給丫頭的呢。也不知道是現在送給這丫頭的呢。若是以前送的，那還罷了，若是現在送的，這事讓趙家知道，那還了得？如此想着時，手上捧了相片，兩眼注視在上面，只管發了呆。許久的時候，他在俗話裏面，找出一句話來，把這問題解决了，就是女大不中留。看這個樣子，他丈夫從軍在外，他的意中人，雖是不常見面，可是他的家庭，就在斜對門，不要粗心大意的，惹出了什麽禍事。如此想着，將那相片和書本還給它塞到枕頭下面去。對於桂枝，依然是像平常一樣，裝成不知道有什麽心事。到了次日，到後院裏和趙翁閑談，説來説去，説到了趙自强身上。江氏道：老太爺，我仔細想想，這姻事不應該再擱住了。我瞧着，你可以寫信和自强商量商量，若是抽得動身的話，就讓他在這不冷不熱的日子，請兩個禮拜的假，回來把這喜事辦了罷，老太爺，你瞧怎麽樣。（二六五）信，我找到一張報紙給伊核對一下，伊纔没有話講呢。同事中有幾個人，稱阮玲玉是電影西施，在蘇州西施是感到太多了！凡是女子稍有姿色的，他們多稱頌伊爲西施，什麽牛肉西施咧，排骨西施咧，煤炭西施咧，荳腐西施咧，……爲了這些西施，我每逢星期日，總去分别一識廬山面目。我覺得稱女子爲西施是侮辱女性，不然，西施豈容亂稱？</p>
<p>花瓶是裝飾品，點綴點綴，稱女子爲花瓶，也是侮辱女性，好像女子的工作技能薄弱，只好做一隻花瓶看看的。那末機關上的飯桶何嘗没有？只見男子呌女子花瓶，不見女子呌男子飯桶，這是男女不平等吧！</p>

<p>短篇小説</p>
<h3>哀傷的事跡</h3>
<p>— 水草</p>
<p>清早，從夢裏醒來；躺在床上，聽着外面秋風夾着細雨打在玻窗上刷刷的聲音；天氣很陰暗，室中靜靜的，身子蝗伏在單被裏，眼睛望着帳頂；心裏在想一些過去不可磨滅的事，回憶便像一首晚風裏從遠處吹來的牧歌，輕輕地吹進人的心坎裏了。於是就得慢慢的重温起來。心裏很憂鬱，雖然不會感傷得流涙，但已悽凉得可以了！</p>
<p>記得去年在呂巷　舅處，那時候權姑娘也在那邊：一個春天晴朗的下午，我同權姑娘倚着樓窗望外景。草頭花開遍在田野裏；菜花像金子，蝴蝶蜜蜂往金子襄鑽。權姑娘待自己很好，削白了的甘藍往我嘴裏笑。自己的手擱在權姑娘的肩上，輕輕的拍着；權姑娘時常斜過眼來，嘴上露着笑，頭髮蓬亂在額角上；怪可愛，怪美麗的姑娘！</p>
<p>（權姑娘，你像蝴蝶，夠活潑的；我最愛蝴蝶！）自己望着遠處，對權姑娘低低的説。</p>
<p>（那麽你就得愛我呵！）權斜睨着自己，微微的笑；兩條眉兒細長得很可變。</p>
<p>（愛你，但你呢；你眞的愛我麽？）</p>
<p>（當你第一次到我家裏時，我就愛你啦！）低下了頭笑。忽然權姑娘反轉身體，兩手搭在我肩膀上；（熙，你是不是明天要回去？不能再多住一天麽？）一個瓜子形的臉袋兒，貼在自已的襯衫上；眼睛釘着我，摇着身體問。</p>
<p>（多住一天麽？好！不過母親要盼望呢！）實際自己也想多住麽一天，離開一個可愛的姑娘，孤單單的踏上了航船；獨個兒聽着水聲，滋味兒是怪難受的。（但過了明天怎麽樣呢？後天仍得分别呵！）自己的一顆心很陰暗，權姑娘待自己的好意，是很可感激的。但一分别就得幾個月呵！</p>
<p>（别談談分别，談起你就得没趣！但我同你，熙，你下半年有何計劃？）左手升起來扭着我的臉，急切的問。　　（進大學吧！權，幾時我們能住在一起？）我説。</p>
<p>（四年，等你畢了業！）權姑娘笑。</p>
<p>（四年，長長的日子！女孩兒家就容易變心呀！）　　（哼，你不變心就好了！我的心早被你帶去了，再有誰能佔據我的心呢，）權姑娘低下頭去。黑領帶在伊的頭髮上被微風飛舞着。</p>
<p>（那麽，好。願天保佑我們成功！）眼睛望着天，天很高，遠處有一二朶白雲輕輕的不知飛向什麽地方去。</p>
<p>（願天保佑我們成功！）</p>
<p>雙手扳轉權姑娘的身體，捧着伊的臉；一個小得很可愛的鼻子，紅的嘴唇，白得很嫵媚的牙齒！微微的笑；自己低下願去，一個水遠刻劃在心頭的不可忘記的吻！</p>
<p>月缺了又月圓，月圓了又月缺，與權姑娘的没有見面，又將一年了。在這一年内，自己的心雖然有一次動摇過；但權姑娘對自己的好意，在我這不幸的遭遇裏，是怎樣也不會忘記的一個！</p>
<p>在雨夜的黄昏中，清晨的微風裏；當一個人呆呆的在回想一些過去的事跡時，首起爬進記憶裏的就是權姑娘！　　秋風偷偷的吹過枕畔頭，寄語秋風：故人無恙，惟願權姑娘努力加餐！</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>説産業落後國的利益</h3>
<p>— 郁達夫</p>
<p>兩三年來，世界經濟大恐慌的波浪，席捲全球；原因當然是在生産過剩，歐洲大戰後各國國民經濟不裕，一般購買力的消失，國際間賠欵償還的結果，資本偏在堆積而不能流通等地方。恐慌的落局，自然就發生出失業的問題，政治和社會的不安問題，國際商塲爭奪更烈的問題等等。</p>
<p>但中國因爲産業落後，所受到的世界經濟大恐慌的影響，却不其顯著，所以有些論客，反在歌頌我們中國産業落後的好處。</p>
<p>第一，説到失業，中國的四萬萬同胞，有業者本來不多，除了幾處都會的工業勞働者外，大部分的壯丁，都以當兵打仗爲職業。本來無業，失也無從失起，近來且到處皆在招募新兵，所以失業問題，在中國是容易解决的。</p>
<p>第二，説到政治和社會的不安，中國二十餘年來，本來也就没有安過，所以老百姓對於怎麽是安定的狀態，怎麽是不安定的狀態，委實也分辨不清楚。</p>
<p>第三，國際商場的爭奪，中國向來就没有過這麽一回事。奪來奪去，我們自己人中間，也還忙不過來，還管牠什麽國際不國際。</p>
<p>産業舊後，旣有些三得，最後還有一個大利，就是中國人乘此世界大恐慌的時期，却得著了一個買外國便宜貨的機會；非但買者便宜，就是賣者，只教把中國商標一印一貼，也立時可以製造出許多同外國貨一樣的國産貨品來，豈不快哉，也豈不痛哉！</p>
<h3>小樂子的蟋蟀</h3>
<p>— 煥明</p>
<p>（這是蜈蚣變的！）</p>
<p>小樂子那尾紅頭蟀蟋不久就鬥出了名。日子長了些，連主人四德都聽到了（紅頭將軍）這我字。主人也養蟋蟀，且三天二天的把蟋蟀罐提到城裏去賭輸贏。歸來時，如没有帶點酒菜回來，凖得找些事出來噴噴白沬，吐出些咒駡，即使悶聲不響，就在那張拉長臉上也可瞧出他的蟋蟀今天是吃了敗仗，害他輸了錢。</p>
<p>（……牛放飽了嗎－你一定没放飽，好吃懶做，那個蟋蟀拿給我瞧瞧看。）</p>
<p>小樂子把養在香烟罐裏的那尾（紅頭將軍）小心的捧出來，不知那末的一回事，他的心卜卜地儘跳。</p>
<p>主人瞧到烟罐子，臉色變慢鬱了：（把這樣好的香烟摃拿來養蟀－哼，好大膽！）</p>
<p>幸而主人的眼轉到那尾蟋蟀上時，他的臉色就迅速地變成春天樣了。用一支金黄色的粗蟋蟀草對那小虫豸撥弄兩下，笑就在他臉上爬動起來。小樂小咬着食指站在一邊怯怯地樂了。</p>
<p>（鬥鬥看！）四德自個兒低語着，把（紅頭將軍）細心地趕進蟋蟀房搬到鬥罐裏，小樂子伸長𩓐子悄悄地臨近去。　　（走開！）</p>
<p>於是小樂子開始躭憂了。</p>
<p>直到晚上，（紅頭將軍）仍未歸還他。小樂子懦怯地注意了兩天主人的臉色：主人撫摸着下頦，或是用食指搯搯鼻子，或反綁了手在大廳裏的（烏磚地）上來回踱着，安閒地。（哼！）他的眼突然兇閃閃地掉在樂子的臉上：（老是鬼頭鬼腦的，像個什麽烏樣兒，除掉放牛别的活像都没你的賬－去削擔草泥來）！</p>
<p>午後，來了兩個携有蟋蟀罐的客。在大廳上，他們精細地把蟋蟀一一稱了分量。在二堆錢鈔邊，蟋蟀就鬥了起來。　　四德的是得了勝：他坐在圓桌邊慢慢地喝着酒，二條腿在桌下像患（抖驚風）樣的不停地抖動着，咬了一口豆腐乾，瞧瞧桌一邊的蟋蟀罐獨自個兒笑着。</p>
<p>小樂子像影似的走近主人，愴惶地把視線亂擱：（我的那個蟋蟀…）他顫着嗓子。</p>
<p>四德微微地楞了楞説：（小孩子養蟋蟀幹什麽？）</p>
<p>小樂子抖動嘴唇，俯下頭來咬着衣角</p>
<p>（把大門背後的那二把鏟子拿去磨磨。）</p>
<p>小樂子還是癱住了似地默着。</p>
<p>（呐，豆腐乾！）主人威儀又和柔地遞給小藥子半塊豆腐乾！（去，快去把那二把鏟子拿到塘沿磨磨快！）</p>
<p>他懦怯怯地接過半塊豆腐乾，拿了鏟子，悽悽惶惶的朝塘沿走。（紅頭將軍！）想到這裏，一陣鯁喉的力量使他的氣管抽搐起來，小樂子終於吐出一小塊還没嚼碎的豆腐乾：對着塘中的影子嗚咽起來。</p>
<h3>關於（現實的認識）與（藝術的表現）（續）</h3>
<p>— 侍桁</p>
<p>徐先生更殘缺地而也不免有些歪曲地引用了我講（父與子）的那段話———（一（父與子），以其對於現實認識的深邃，）以其藝術表現的正確，使這種雛形漸漸地成長着，俄羅斯社會終歸出現了巴札洛夫的類型的人……）———於是便論道：（這簡直把屠格湼夫説成一個上帝，是他的藝術製作力使俄羅斯社會出現了巴札洛夫！）在這場合，他的論旨已經和我背馳了，我是在講（父與子）這個藝術品的社會影響的效果，而他還是在講藝術中的藝術部份的機能。我旣承認巴札洛夫是一個（新時代的雛形），我就能明白這（雛形實已在現實中存在），我旣説屠格湼夫眼光的深邃，我也就能清楚（存在先於思維），如果雛形不是從現實中捉取來的，他又在什麽地方呢？如果存在不先於思維，屠格湼夫怎樣使用他的深邃的眼光呢？但因此就説（父與子）這藝術品是與其表現的（雛形）的社會的發展毫無關係，而它的成長完全（是社會的客觀條件使然），這是等於那一面雖在談説着藝術而一面又根本否定了藝術的人的説話一樣。當然，社會的客觀的條件産生時代的人的這原則，是無法否認的；但在巴札洛夫的這塲合，徐先生是忘了藝術在其表現的人型的社會的發展的前途上所給與的規範了。而且當屠格湼夫從現實中捉取這雛形並給以表現的時候我們雖不能否定其已社會的地存在，而其存在之無明顯的社會發展的意識，由那書之出版的當時的社會的反嚮看來，也是不可否認的事實吧。但誰使這雛形得到明顯的社會的發展的意識，明顯地要求社會存在的權力，不在雛形中夭折，而終歸變成了一個實存的巴札洛夫的呢？我們能説（父與子）這部書是與這種人型的社會的發展没有關係麽？克洛泡特金在論這書時的那報告，並不是騙人的———（現實使屠格湼夫寫成了這書，而這書更擴大地影響了社便。）可是能夠先人一步地從那尚未獲得明顯的社會發展的意識的現實中便捉取了雛形，而且給這雛形預定下明顯的社會發展的規範的藝術家屠格湼夫，的的確確是在演着預言家的職務了，這話又有什麽（可笑的）呢？不只寫（父與子）的屠格湼夫是一個預言家、寫（沙寗）的阿志巴綏夫也是一個預言家，不過後者是一個不正確的預言家而已。並非我有意要（把預言家這個頭銜加到屠格湼夫（或其他俄國作家）的頭上去），實際上近代俄國文學作家中是太多預言家了，而這一點恐惶也正是近代俄國文學的特色之最主要的一點吧。</p>
<p>徐先生很有興趣地説，我（簡直把屠格湼夫説成一個上帝）了，自然，我也不會那樣地推崇一個作家，可是同時也不能像徐先生那般把藝術家看成完全被動的機械的毫無自由意志的人·除云在那麽一塊現實的原料之外、在藝術領域　的藝術家·當創造人物的時候，是和在宇宙　的上帝没有什麽差别的。上帝造人固然是隨心之所欲，而藝術家造人却也不能就像一個無影機。請允許我杜撰一個新的詞句，藝術家是他的藝術吳作的領域裏的上帝！把藝術取用的現實看成了那麽一塊死東西，藝術家對它毫無辦法，只能作一個照相機，眞是把藝術家的職務看得太易也看得太低了，因爲徐先生對於藝術的認識的程度是這樣的，所以他才會問：（…難道他以爲阿志巴綏夫的藝術製作力再高明一點、就可把沙寗變無爲有麽？）已經認一了這誤謬地藝術表現出來的固形的沙寗是社會的地不存在的，縱有上帝的神力，也是枉然吧，然而這前題已經就錯了。據我所知，一般文學史家並不完全否定沙寗的類型的人的社會的存在，可是那被阿志巴綏夫表現在藝術裏的固形的沙寗，因爲先是藝術的地不眞實，所以也就不會有社會的地存在的可能了；更明確地講，（沙寗的作者對於他製造的人物的認識是錯誤的，而表現在藝術裏給這人物的社會的發展的規範也是錯誤的，眞實的在社會上發展的波寗是和藝術品讓的沙寗走了越離越遠的相反的路了。當我講到沙寗的非眞實性的時候，我是説這顯示在藝術品裏的沙寗的，——按照阿志巴綏夫對於沙寗的人物的認識，對於沙寗的藝術的表現，以及他所預言給沙寗的（應當如此）的設想，沙寗是成了作家的幻想的呆實了。反過來，若依從徐先生的機械的看法，凡是社會的地存在的東西，作家總能夠把它寫成眞實的了，而我倒時常看見，或是因爲認識的不正確，我是因爲表現的不正確，眞實的也被寫成不眞實的了。（沙寗）的作者旣是這樣的一位作家，那麽徐先生也就無需爲他辯護，而説：（侍桁先生的批評眞是苛酷啊！</p>
<p>但一點我總應當向讀者和徐先生道歉——卽，我不能直接地讀俄文書，根據不甚良好的幾種譯本，如果對於原作的藝術不能得到充分的認識，而便下了如上的斷語，那不止是苛酷，而更可以説是武斷了。不過若以其他的俄文學作品的譯書比較來看的話，——如果（沙寗）的譯本不是一個特殊的例，（沙寗），作爲一本享有世界聲譽的名著，它的藝術的製作力，實在是相差得太遠了。</p>
<h3>兩兄弟（五六）</h3>
<p>— 莫泊桑著　李維克譯</p>
<p>他决定趁着自己遷居的機會，邀大家到聖約安去作一次郊游，晚飯後再邀大家到他的新房子裏去喝茶。羅蘭老爹想要由海道去，但因爲路遠的關係，並且由海路去如果遇着逆風的話，説不定什麽時候可以航到，大家都不贊成他的辦法，結果租了一輛四輪輕馬車去作這次遠足散步。</p>
<p>大家在將近大點鐘時候動身，以便趕到那邊午餐。那塵土蔽天的大道展開在洛曼底的郊野中間，麥浪起伏的平原和圍着樹木的田地使得這片郊野像是一個無盡的公園一樣。在那被兩隻肥馬拖着慢慢前進的車子裡，羅蘭一家人，陸醉米太太和博齊汝船長大家都沉默着，被車輪的聲音震得聾了，並且大家在那雪霧似的塵土裏閉了眼睛。</p>
<p>這正是成熟的收獲時期。在那深綠色的苴蓿，生綠色的甜蘿蔔旁邊，黄色的麥子以一種金黄的亮光照明着郊野。這些麥子好像喝了那落在它們身上的太陽光一樣。這裏那裡都有人在開始收割麥子，在那受着鐮刀攻擊的田裡，我們看得見人們摇摇擺擺，把他們那翼形的大刄在地圍游來游去。　　走了兩個鐘頭之後，馬車折入左邊的一條路上，從那轉動着的風磨，那憂鬱的灰色的遺留物，那腐了一半而被永遠廢棄了的，那些古舊風磨中的最後的存留者的近邊經過，隨後便走進一個美麗的院落，在一所漂亮的房子前面停住了，這是本地有名的客寓。</p>
<p>那綽號（美人亞爾浮齊）的女主人，微笑着走到車門口，把手伸給那兩位在太高的踏脚前躊躇着的女太太。</p>
<p>在一個帳篷底下，在那有蘋果樹蔭覆着的牧場邊上，一些外鄉人，一些從愛特爾達來的巴黎人已在　着午餐；在屋子裏面大家也聽到一些人語，笑聲和碗碟的音響。</p>
<p>所有的飯廳都坐滿了，羅蘭一行祗好在房間裏吃着。突然，羅蘭看見壁上掛着一些捕灰色海蝦的網罟。</p>
<p>（啊！啊！）他呌説道，（這裏也可以捕蝦嗎？）</p>
<p>（是啦，）博齊汝船長回答，（並且這裏還是全海岸捕得最多的地方呢。）</p>
<p>（好極了！我們吃過飯去捕蝦如何？）</p>
<p>恰好那五三點鐘的時候潮乾；於是决定下午大家在礁石裏面捕蝦消遣。</p>
<p>大家都吃得不多，免得把脚踏在水裏的時候有腦充血的危險。並且大家都想留着肚子吃晚飯，因爲晚飯已經定了豐盛的酒席，六點鐘便得備齊等他們回來吃。</p>
<p>羅蘭老爹没有耐性兒。他想要去買那種和牧塲裏捉蝴蝶的東西非常相似的專門捕蝦的器具。</p>
<p>這東西呌做Lanets。這是一些網做的小袋繫在一個縛在一根長棒盡頭的木圈上。亞爾浮齊老是微笑着，把這東西借了給他。隨後她便帮助兩位女太太做了一個臨時的裝束，免得把她們的長袍弄濕了。她把一些短裙，大的毛襪，草底鞋等借給她們。男子則把們的皮鞋脱去，在附近的鞋匠家買了舊鞋子或木鞋穿着。</p>
<p>隨後便一齊上路，肩上擱着蝦網，背上負着背籃。陸醉米太太在這種裝束之下顯得非常好看、顯出一種出人意外的，農家女人的勇敢的風韻。</p>
<p>她把亞爾浮齊借給她的那條短裙很俏皮的捲起，用針縫緊了，以便能夠放胆在那些礁石上面跑着跳着。她把脚踝和小腿的下節露在外面，這是那種强壯而又婀娜嬌小的女人的堅實的小腿。腰身没有縛緊，可以隨意轉動；她還找着一頂園丁用的黄色闊邊大草帽戴在頭上，草帽的一邊捲起用一柳條扎住，使她現出一副銃手似的勇敢的樣子。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>某種事件</h3>
<p>— 非人</p>
<p>小竊，盜賊，綁匪，這一類的勾當，天然都是作奸犯科的行爲，王法條條，原無赦理，輕者處以徒刑，重者以衛生丸相餉，固是咎有應得，法網難逃。</p>
<p>但是小竊，盜賊，綁匪，到底是人，其中（賊星照命）甘作非法行爲的，不能説完全没有，但究竟少數的少數，大都數原是爲饑塞交迫，不得不鋌而走險，所以不同他們根本治療，這一類的病症總是難瘳，除非殺，否則無論拘禁幾月，甚至幾年，一旦刑期告滿，還是要幹他們的勾當，並且知道他們（跌進去）一次，就膽大一次，因爲他們除此以外，簡直没有辦法，没有生路。</p>
<p>即如某種事件，天然亦是打家刦寨的行爲，王法條條之下，自然有殺無赦但幹這勾當的，雖未必饑寒交迫，但一定有與饑寒交迫同等的重大要求。方敢幹此作好犯科的事實，凖此以談，應該想法，使他們不致於饑寒，更不致藉口饑寒等等而爲作奸犯科的事，否則即使處以徒刑－因爲决不能完全處以死刑－他日依舊再來一回鼠竊狗偷的勾當，所謂（單有千日做賊，斷無千日防賊）</p>
<p>賊天然是最惡劣的行爲。做賊更爲（勤脱兒們）所不齒，被竊的當事人，自然是恨之刺骨，必欲置諸死地而後快，但自旁人看來，天然另有一種或想，這種感想，的確並非同情於作賊，但畢竟與當事人的感想不會同樣的深刻，可以斷言。</p>
<p>小竊，盜賊，綁匪，的根本救濟方法，曰有罪犯習藝所等等在，可以治療，若某種罪犯，更有何種根本辦法以解决之歟？這個答案，原是非常複雜而難言，我只是敬借孔老先生一句話，作抽象的説法，曰，（修己以安人。）</p>
<h3>斷水糾紛</h3>
<p>— 韋拔</p>
<p>上海，是一個動人的地名。上海的市民是有福的，不聽見砲聲，也不看見飛機下炸彈，——雖然在（一二八）時曾有過一回，但現在總是没有了，總比其他的各個省分爲佳。——至關於生活所需的種種部門，吃則有中西大菜，穿則有中西服裝。住則有高大洋房，自來水，電燈，電話，煤氣爐灶。行則有電車，自動車，娛樂則有游藝場，影戲院，跳舞場等等，更有其他各地所或有或没有的種種便利，如抽鴉片，如賭博，如嫖堂子，如上按摩院……凡是二十世紀的都市裏所應有的，上海無不有。可隨着你的意向去花錢，而没有内地的種種束縛。於是内地一般的人們都紅着眼説：（天堂！）（天堂！）羣投奔到這個都市裏來作市民，而上海也就這樣更繁榮起來了。</p>
<p>但上海的繁榮，雖建築於三百萬市民的身上，而大權則假手於百十個帝國主義半殖民地的統治者與其買辦階級之流的手裏。所謂一切現代化的幸福的享受，是在（柔馴地受剝削）這一條件之下換來的。要是對於剝削的政策，承受不了，而敢稍稍喊出了一聲（痛！）那末你就有吃不着你種下的繁榮之果的機會。</p>
<p>不信請看最近滬東柏福，柏禄，柏壽三里的斷水風潮，就可知道帝國主義者是怎樣難於掩藏他這付面目了！</p>
<p>計自英商自來水公司實行加價以後，各地斷水風潮，就報不絶書。用户雖具有决心，而公司方面則惟用高壓手段，以（斷水）相恐嚇。柏福等三里斷水糾紛，發生已逾月，因用户的决心，與公司方面態度的强硬，以致迄未解决。該數里業主及用户，雖曾推派代表向工部局請願，亦未得圓滿結果。而自來水公司面方，則以用户的不甘受屈服，認爲大損其（英商）的尊嚴，故斷水之後，尤以爲未足，最近復將里内費銀二千餘兩所裝置的太平龍頭截去，並非特截去里内的太平龍頭，更將汾州路平凉路間（該里附近）馬路上的太平龍頭總水管關閉，因此涓滴俱無，致使二千餘人日用水源，發生恐慌。（民非水火不生活），該數里住户爲維持生命計，乃不得已備具大比水缸，僱用挑夫向黄浦江挑水應急，但污濁的黄浦水，怎可充作飲料，而火警的發生，屬尤堪虞，不能不説於全市的治安有重大的影響。但在半殖民地的統治者的眼光裏，這是咎有應得的——誰呌你們不願柔馴地受剝削，而偏要喊痛呢——這便是（福地）上海中（没福）的事實。</p>
<p>我們知道自來水是一種公共事業，公共的事業，應以謀公衆的福利爲前提，何况用水問題是直接關係着全體市民的健康災害與生存的問題，决不能由於一經分人去操縱的。但在這資本主義的社會裏，資本主義統治下半殖民地的上海，這還有什麽話説！</p>
<p>柏福等三里二千餘居民，不能不説他是造成（繁榮的上海）的一員吧？但結果呢？爲了不甘受剝削，喊了一聲（痛！）便蒙着生命的危險喝黄浦水！同樣的每個繁榮上海的人員，對此塲作何感想呢？</p>
<h3>大家歡迎</h3>
<p>— 宓耳</p>
<p>這兩天本埠消息最惹人注意的當然是馬可尼的行蹤了。在科學界有像他這樣偉大的發明，馬氏之值得我們的竭誠歡迎，並不是一件偶然的事情，况且外國人歡迎我們中國人，和我們中國人歡迎外國人，只是各盡地主之誼，而不是異乎尋常令人側目的舉動。可是，事實告訴我們，外國人有時確有值得我們歡迎的價值，而我們中國人對外國去的能給外國人歡迎的價值，可説是絶無僅有！譬如：前次來的蕭伯訥。他在世界文壇上的權感，和他白頭少年的精神等，在在多值得我們去歡迎他來，給我們枯乏得可憐的中國以有益的指教。這次來的馬可尼是個電機發明家，自然更值得我們的歡迎。他們到我們這裏來，能替他們的祖國增光輝，能給我們這班後進以眞確的嚮導。因此他們的游歷，非但對他們個人或祖國爲有益，就是於一斑的人類，也像大雨之於將槁的苗，眞是受惠非淺啊！這也就是有幾位外國來賓所以值得我們歡迎的之最强有力的理由</p>
<p>那末，我們中國人年來到外國去而受到外國人熱烈歡迎的，除了宋財長之外，恐怕就是天下聞名的和平軍人張先生了－他的給天下（聞名），當然也不是偶然的。他是犧牲了一切來顯出他擁護世界和平的精神！而九一八之後他得不到世界和平的奬金，我們應當請馬可尼發明陰陽電報，那末我們可以拍個萬急電報給王旡能，請他在游地府的時候，到閻羅王面前替那位和平少帥呼寃！</p>
<p>世界和平奬金委員雖然不能賞識我倘的張少帥，國内同胞雖不能見諒他，而外國人却很歡迎他。你們不見他在外國也像蕭翁和馬氏之受人歡迎嗎？可是歡迎的用意，各不相同。我們歡迎蕭馬等先生，我們的意思，一方是表示敬仰，一方是請指導我們的後進；而外國人歡迎張先生，其意恐怕是想提高他的地位，希望他將來再回祖國任軍政要職，送些領土給他倔，正像在九一八時送給我們的矮鄰一樣！</p>
<p>張先生將歸來了，聽説國府將委以重任。我們且看他和平精神第二次的發揚光大吧！</p>

<h3>禮－十天的薪水－</h3>
<p>— 孟達</p>
<p>終日栗栗碌碌，不得一霎兒空閑的老趙，當然啦！他爲了生活的驅使，八小時刻板式的（辦公室）生活，和一些不能避免的無聊的應酬，累得他腰酸頭眩；回到了家裏來，心中滿想的在床上安息了一回。可是不識熨貼的妻子－梅，却又絮絮聒聒的，來和他纏繞不休</p>
<p>：　　（下個月九號，是我父親的生日你做大女婿的，預備送些什麽禮？）</p>
<p>（禮嗎？看起吧！）老趙打着呵欠，漫不經意地答。</p>
<p>（杏妹家裏送的是：一個寳藍緞幛，一柄純白眞玉如意：還有二副擔子，二十瓶酒。但是我們預備怎麽樣的呢？）？</p>
<p>（他們都這麽樣的。但是，我却有些犯不着和他們打比，）</p>
<p>（打比？）梅顯然有些不高興的樣子，她説：我就没有存心和他們打比呀！反正這都是你的面子。）</p>
<p>（這話等脱幾天再談罷！横豎還有十數天呢？－今天，可有人來看我過嗎？）老趙很想把這事丢開，所以把别的話，來岔開它。</p>
<p>（什麽樣的人？没有來看你過，唉！你這個人爲什麽老是這麽的温吞脾氣？無論做一件什麽事情，終是那樣的不爽氣？眞是恨透了，人啦！雖然日子還有十天，但是，我們便不應該早一些的商量嗎？）梅這時動了氣，半發怒半埋怨的説。</p>
<p>（那末，依你怎樣樣呢？）老趙覺得無話可説。</p>
<p>（我原是要問你啊！你是一家之主，我有什麽主義呢？）梅終是這們的態度，自己心理明明的有了成見，但是却不肯先開口。</p>
<p>老趙哈哈的説：（旣然你没有主意，却還不是由我來做全權代表？等幾天我當然自有道理呵。）</p>
<p>（又是等幾天，等到那兒去呀？你便不好上一點勁兒嗎？老是那麽推三阻四的。）</p>
<p>（好罷！今天夜裏是來不及的了！晤，明天月底，後天一號；好！准定到一號公司裏發出薪水，我去替你辦來；那你也不必多囌，吧！）</p>
<p>第一天，老趙任辦公處領了薪水回</p>
<p>家來，他牢記着妻叮囑的話，爲了不認拂妻的熱忱，當然只好盡力的照妻的意思去售辦。他在各處兜合了一回，便買了一大包的禮物，呌了一部街車，車到他的寓所裏來。</p>
<p>老趙在車子上望着那一大包的東西，心裏轉着念頭：（人情急如債。）這人情（便是所謂（禮））眞是比債還要厲害哩！欠了人家的錢，倒還可以約明天還或懇求再緩幾天；可是這所謂禮啊！那由得你可以任意遲緩呢，哼！禮倒還吧了！並且人家還要嫌你送的禮物的豐菲哩！</p>
<p>老趙想到了出神。車子已拉進了他的住所仁成　　　　　　　　幾號門牌他才驚了轉來，連忙命車夫在八號的後門停了下來；車夫帮着他把東西搬進了屋子裏，妻子梅早已猜到了那是做什麽用的了！但却故意的問道：</p>
<p>（什麽東西呀？這麽的！大包。）</p>
<p>（你猜，猜着了，我便把這東西送給你的爸爸。）老趙打着玩笑，一面拿車力付給了車夫。</p>
<p>梅笑嘻嘻的打開了紙包，裏面是一大一小的兩個盒子，都是紅木框子，上等玻璃，大匣子裝的一付白瓷的（福禄壽三星），兩尺多高，滿身彩金，很是精緻；小匣子禮，是一對大約八寸高的高脚銀杯，花紋雕鏤得尤其考究。於是她望着老趙，很滿意地笑了！</p>
<p>（這些東西可以比得上一柄玉如意嗎？）老趙諷刺似的問。</p>
<p>（並不是我要你買這些東西來和他們打比？實在我也是爲了你的面子；並且連我在姊妹家裏，娘家，也就覺得光彩得多了！）梅心中很快活，當然不得不安慰似地向老趙仔細解　。</p>
<p>（哼！面子？可是十天的薪水……）老趙肚裏四白，臉上露出了苦笑。</p>
<h3>我没有靈魂出賣</h3>
<p>— 列火</p>
<p>一聞不滿方丈的小樓，白的粉墻，已褪成暗褐色了朝外的窗口不到一個方桌大，衖堂又那麽狹，對過樓的嫂嫂還要天天有那麽多的尿布高高的搭晒着，小樓越益黝黑了。四季都有着一股刺鼻的霉氣。窗口的右邊，貼糊着夾層的報紙，那就是（將就）的衣櫉所在，上頭也蒙罩了厚厚的一層灰塵，一層蜘蛛網。</p>
<p>這就是老戴三年來的寓室。</p>
<p>晨起，他就那麽抹了一把冷水面，坐近塌脚的寫字臺，提起筆想寫點東西，却總手指有些發抖，兩眼就移向那夾層的報紙，天氣漸漸的寒冷起來了呵！袷襖絨衫都紥上了身，只有那麽破舊的棉襖，掛在那夾層的報紙裏，以這幾天的寒冷講，眞夠把它加紥了。然而更有冷的天氣到啦，下雨天，結霜天，落雪天啦！將來更怎麽挨受？</p>
<p>他想到這裏，他呆了。</p>
<p>（咚咚咚），忽然門外有敲門聲，接着老陳就立現在他的身旁，老陳有些驚奇，問；（戴，又想什麽心事了？稿紙浸濕了啦！）</p>
<p>（呵，你來了！老陳，是你來了！外面挺冷吧！）老戴害羞的兩眼連䀹連䀹，滿想隠失他的秘密。</p>
<p>（是的，外面更冷！你爲什麽還不把棉襖紥上？）</p>
<p>（唔？——）老戴没有　説下去。</p>
<p>彼此面面相覷的沉點着。</p>
<p>老戴收了一口氣，呶一呶嘴，緊握着的拳頭一伸，精神飽滿了許多，他開始發揮他議論：</p>
<p>（之社會是很滑稽的，是人在吃着人，有本事的得不到生活的保障，没有本事的，倒多數在縱慾的享樂，這其間，　分就　有没有靈魂　　　　　　　你有靈魂出賣，你就有出路，你就能飛黄騰達；否則社會是不理會你的。生活圈子的廣狹，全以此爲指歸。</p>
<p>老陳，你該知道吧！我是没有多少本事的，但這却不是我倒楣的唯一原因，實實是爲的我没有靈魂出賣，二三年來機會難不多，但也有過了不少回；不過都有一個先决條件，就是首先要收買我的靈魂，我的性子是確　了，我没有靈魂出賣，我不願出賣我的靈魂，就此，一個個已到了手的機會，都讓它們滾開了，也就是我此刻有些發抖的總原因。</p>
<p>二三年來物質給予我的鞭打，確是夠足了，但我仍舊一逕保持了自己的靈魂，也就是我的靈魂還有歸宿，我在切盼着花一般美麗的社會前路，我的靈魂是要瀝在那些花枝上的，要爲我自己所景仰的意志去宣洩！</p>
<p>我相信，社會决不會永遠是漆黑一團，現社會一般的靈魂顧主，也總有毁滅的一天到臨。就是他們現在所能欺侮的，也只有那些意志薄弱没有確切認識的人，這些人是和顧主們一樣的是社會的蠶蟲。假使他們覺醒起來，參加我們的團集－誓不出賣靈魂的團集，顧主們有什麽辦法，這也就是社會有辦法的時候了。</p>
<p>老陳，現在就少了一班不出賣靈魂的人呵！</p>
<p>（你講來講去，總是什麽靈魂，靈魂，可眞有些費解！）老陳擾斷了他的話機。</p>
<p>（靈魂就是自己的意志！矢心信迎的社會眞理！）　　彼此復歸到先前的沉默。</p>

<h3>星相三字訣</h3>
<p>— 士本</p>
<p>前天晚上，在老胡家裏吃湯餅酒，席上共十一人，狂飲暢談，有的議論時事，有的談談風月，有的大講賭經，惟有老余，他是出身軍旅，走遍中原南北，三教九流，無不交接，所以江湖上的門檻，也很精悉，這夜他告訴我們，星相家騙人的（三字秘訣），言言中肯，語語入理，不愧其走遍南北的老江湖本色！在座諸人，都屏息靜氣地，側耳傾聽，他説：（人們每云那里有一位星家很準，那里有一位相家很靈，一若這種星相家，果眞能知過去未來，於是星相家在社會上的潛勢力，也就根深蒂固，若輩的生涯，也就應接不暇，門庭若市了！其實這般星相家的所謂（奇門遁甲），（文王課），（ＸＸ相法），等等的江湖技術，都是做做幌子，實際上，他們騙錢的唯一不二法門，却都是靠了師傅傳授下來的一個（三字秘訣），不論其爲星家，相家，祇要依此秘訣來隨機應變，那就無往而不利了，人們也就異口同聲的説他怎樣怎樣地神騐哩！西洋鏡一拆穿，原也没有什麽希罕，我自從知道了這（三字訣）以後，就對於社會上種種星相術，根本不信仰了，終年也就省却了許多枉費的金錢，現在我不鄙吝，把這秘訣，公開告訴你們，待你們聽了，以後也省些無謂的破費吧。講到我這（三字訣），是民初當團長時，在滁州軍次，結識了一位很紅的星家，彼此日久了，很覺投機，所以他破例的告訴我知道的啊。不過這（秘訣），説來也很簡單，根本只有三個字，就是：（贊許嘆），什麽謂之（贊）？就是遇到了人家呌你算小孩子的人命，或相小孩子的相，你必須（贊）美這小孩子一番，因爲；人家和小孩子問命問相，必定歡喜説吉利話，你明白了這種做父母者的心理，就神氣活現地，天花亂墜的（贊）他這個小孩，將來長大了，會怎樣怎樣地飛黄騰達，定可做大官，發大財，命好相好，是一個（ＸＸ格），（ＸＸ形），人世間這樣的福命貴相，簡直是少有的啦！結結實實的拍了一頓馬屁（就是贊）。於是，他的父母，心中必然無窮的快樂，轉了背，也就無疑地義務宣傳，説這位先生怎樣怎樣地靈騐了。第二個（許）字，是逢到壯年人用的，譬如有一個三十歲的男子，來問相，或算命，一定他近幾年來，環境不良，作事失意，不然，他也不來問津的，所以你就可説；尊駕近幾年來，怎樣怎樣地不遂意，但是這步歹運，至三十三歲可以交脱了，三十四歲起否極泰來，雲開見日，從此一帆順風，有十五年長生運，這樣地一（許），他聽了，心中必定快樂了。你們只要試看，假使二十五歲去問命，他必然（許）你，三十歲交好運，但是一到了三十歲，再去問他，又是説三十五歲交好運了，像這樣的話，就是一個（許）字的秘訣啊。末後要説一個（嘆）字了，你們知道，一個人到了五六十歲，老態龍鍾，還去問命看相，分明是蔗境不佳啦，不然，不會來請教星相家，所以一遇到年老的人來問命看相，你可以（嘆）息一番，説他一生過去怎樣怎樣不遂意，還假意舉出一個明證，譬如説：尊駕的命，惜乎ＸＸ和ＸＸ一冲，所以一生難期滿意。倘然是看相，那麽你就要：惜乎（地擱太低），惜乎（兩目太露），所以終身勞碌，一無所就哩！横惜乎，豎惜乎地（嘆）着，這老人也就深信自己的命運相貌眞的不佳哩，於是佩服星相家的果然靈騐啊！）合座的人，聽老余説得入情入理，大家乃鼓掌大笑，連呼（老門檻，老門檻）不止。</p>
<h3>死不得和不得死</h3>
<p>— 銅生</p>
<p>一説到死，雖都要帶幾分恐怖。鼻子不呼吸了，血液不循環了，細胞不活動了，神經失掉作用了，　且，　　也没有了，女人也没有了，什麽都没有了，　自己　没有了，　　變得灰灰色的，身户也硬硬裏的，裝進了漆黑的木屋子裏，從此不見天日，這眞是好可怕的一回事呀！</p>
<p>死是個人生命的歸宿，是人生軌道上的盡頭，也就是在任何人等所不可避免的一件大事，所以不論賢愚智不肖等，都免不了一死，你也有死，我也有死，若是你的死期將要臨頭，那末不怕你有多大面子，總是説不通，也不管你有多少錢來做運動費，總是運不動，更不怕你有槍械來衛防，有飛機好逃避，就是你偷偷地匿藏到黑暗的洞角裏，閻王老子還是要派神秘的死神來請你去。</p>
<p>其實死並没有什麽可怕的，也不過和穿衣吃飯是一樣平凡的事，就是怕也怕不了的，須知有生必有死，又何可怕之有呢？社會的傳遞，就是這些生物界在生生死死的兜圈兒，即以咱們所居的上海來看，那一天没有死人抬出去？更放大眼睛，全世界人類中，每天的生産率，總以萬計，而每天的死亡率，也以萬計，生生死死，眞是在忙個不了。又把生物界全體看一下，朝菌不識旦夕，蟪蛄不知春秋，即生即死，即死即生，有何稀奇？</p>
<p>不過，死，在咱們的人羣中，是有死不得和不得死的區别，我現大胆地來作一簡略的界説：死不得的是偉人；不得死的是老百姓。死不得的是資本家；不得死的是勞動者。死不得的是城市中的時髦女人；不得死的是被遺棄的守活寡婦。質言之：死不得的是有錢有勢的闊人：不得死的是朝不保夕的可憐者。</p>
<p>死不得和不得死，顯然具有階級性，死不得者是少數的特殊階級；不得死者是多數的下等階級。地位愈高，威勢愈大，則其死不得的度量，也因之而愈增，雖年登髦耋，且躋期頤，猶曰死不得，於是有衛隊前後擁護者，有鑣師相隨者，甚而有設承露盤求不死藥者，有遣使蓬萊問道方士者，至於修道求佛，乃其常事，因其死不得的自信力越强，則其怕死的恐怖心越大，賣盡氣力，而與死作對抗，假設這船死不得者們，要死得精光，那末老百姓的血，又將讓結誰人吸呢？不過，同時老百姓都在不得死呀！</p>
<p>至於怪可憐的老百姓，生來就是一副賤骨頭，一天苦到晚，一年餓到冬，現代名人書畫張兆芬女士字孝苾四川人</p>
<p>佃兩　　入　門　　　　　　　　　　　　張　　　　　居不蔽風日，食不飽藜藿，流盡血涙，莫能了事，妻飢兒寒，父母凉餓，於是在這要死不得死之中，祇有抱着肚皮）我的天呀！）</p>
<p>再若含寃負屈之徒，怨女曠夫之輩，精衛之恨海難塡，女媧之情天莫補，涙盡則繼之以血，疾首則度日如年，憂憤塡臆，自厭殘生，也是求死不得者之一般。</p>
<p>又如黄浦江上，燕子磯頭，那是不得死者們的最後解决方法，而已死的大人們，有喪事辦事處，有電文訃告，有巫人道士唸經，有告化子打旗，請人題詞，歌功頌德，此不過是死不得者們的尾聲罷了。</p>
<h3>瓜皮小帽</h3>
<p>— 彭翔</p>
<p>天氣一冷，瓜皮小帽盛行了。</p>
<p>一看見這東西，我便聨想到紥脚褲，黄皮臉，打躬，作揖，斯斯文文。</p>
<p>西洋的時事漫畫家畫起美國便繪一個老人，穿了禮帽，名呌山叔叔的來做代表；德國是戴了一頂軍帽，生了一臉亂柴鬍子的軍人；至於中國，我却没有留心過。但是我想：倘畫上一頂瓜皮小帽，下面配上一個尖下巴，最好再加上一條紥脚褲，那倒是很適宜，而且也確能代表這（泱泱大國）之風度的。</p>
<p>到現在，大槪還有不少外國人一想起中國，便聨想到拖着髮辮，花翎，朝珠，馬蹄袖的人物的；但時代倒底進化了，這種人已經没有看見，取而代之的不是紳士帽，如山叔叔所戴的，不是軍士帽，如德大哥所戴的，也不是工人帽；而却是瓜皮小帽。</p>
<p>記得去年某雜誌新年號的封面上，曾經畫上二個老人，戴了瓜皮帽，珩瑂眼鏡，穿着紥脚褲，在對着面打恭作揖：意思是慶賀新年。一邊印着大紅箋條，下面斯斯文文的，是題着什麽古人的名句。</p>
<p>這給了我一個有力的提醒：現在的中國是確被瓜皮小帽在統治着！</p>

<h3>上海（十七）</h3>
<p>— 張老三</p>
<p>我隨意地移動着棋子，没有二十分鐘的對仗，被小黄的車馬砲在我的陣地裏施展威風；雖没有全局敗績，我覺得昏昏然前腦隠隠作痛，免强笑着推開了棋局説；（敗了）。</p>
<p>二十八病</p>
<p>没有吃夜飯，獨由到臥室睡着。心中煩悶，説不出是一種什麽複雜的思想佔據着，四肢發熱，額上更焦炙得可怕：但是五月晚上的微風從窗角吹來，我好像受不住似的蓋上了棉被。</p>
<p>高飛等見了我今天不高興的情形，晚餐後都圍坐到我床前來。我本不願意有誰來擾亂我，見他們這許多人，心中更覺得難言的煩噪，却不好意思請他們暫時給我靜默的休息，儘闔上眼不理會他們。</p>
<p>（青萍，爲什麽自苦呢！小黄抱歉着請求出社哩！）高飛的細小底聲音打破了這窒息的空間。</p>
<p>我張開眼來，見小黄的背形靠着窗口，（他是沉思着，）我想（在社中的朋友，我們都是共過患難的，今天爲了我個人的事，致小黄請求出社）我一陣心酸，嗚咽着説：（小黄請你把窗閉上，我有話説。）我招招手要每一個人都到我床前來。</p>
<p>望着小黄怏怏的走來，我握着他的手説：（快别有這個念頭，一切都不干你的事，今天我到徐家匯去，茫茫然跑了很多的路，兩餐没有進肚，却在午後飽飽的吃了一頓，回來時更在附近喝了刨冰，恐怕今晚上要發寒熱，請你們原諒我，我現在一切明白過來）我喉頭乾燥發痛了，我側過頭去見重慶靠着書桌，就要求他（重慶，請你給我一點開水。）</p>
<p>我喝了開水，繼續説：（我希望不要爲了我個人的事，使你們爲我痛苦）我説着更緊握小黄的手（現在我需要休息，請你們原諒。）</p>
<p>説完話，微微的喘着氣，懇求地瞥了他們一眼，好像很乏力的闔上眼皮，記不起什麽時候睡熟了。</p>
<p>半夜裏醒來，遍體像被火炙着似的，睜開火熱的眼睛想坐起身來，見敏姊默默的坐在床邊。</p>
<p>（弟弟，要喝茶？）她見我醒了，輕輕的問。</p>
<p>我點點頭。</p>
<p>（身上舒服嗎？）她按着我的額角。</p>
<p>我點點頭。</p>
<p>（弟弟，自己病着，不要生氣。我見過慧姊，我們的誤會已解釋明白，你安靜睡着，我也要去睡了。）她説話低低地，却滿露着快活的樣子。</p>
<p>（什麽時候了？）我忽然想起了問。</p>

<h3>駐顔有何術？　要維持精神上之警醒該</h3>
<p>— 馥</p>
<p>▲伊麗莎蘭第之所見</p>
<p>▲美容院難保青春美</p>
<p>伊麗莎蘭第，係無須再來介紹的。她是一位好萊塢的明星；除此之外，她還是一位小説家；她擅長音樂；她當有青春之健康美。因此，她對於青春美保存的方法，是有相當的權威的。她對於駐顔術。最要緊的幾句話係：（你就是住在美春院裡，亦不能保持你的青春。你的精神，你的思想，你的全部生活計劃，必須有勃勃的春氣，然後你的面部纔可以將你的青春輝映出來）。以下係她解釋上文的話：</p>
<p>（但你們不要誤會了。我不是説美容院不重要，可以廢除的，反之，美容院係很重要的，是摩登女子在青春之泉的尋求中，必須的東西。許多最好的化妝品，已經成了今日文明世界確定的必需品了。要是有一個女子，拒絶手邊的美容利器而不用，她可以説是個女界的叛徒，亦可以説她是個蠢物。</p>
<p>（許多人所共知的助妝品，的確已經將現代婦女的美麗，超過了往昔的一切意想。但是，你要知道，你儘管製辦成箱的華美衣服，可是你的美麗，萬萬不能超過你的面容和頭髮所允許的之外。這裏美容院當然能給與你不少帮助。但是天下頂好的美容院，到底不是魔宮，它萬萬没有駐顔之術的。它可以帮助你，但你須要自己盡自己的職，如果你要永保青春美的話。衣裳是可以穿上去的，但是美麗是不能像衣服那樣穿上去的。它必須從内部發出來的。</p>
<p>（人類年齡最大的仇敵，是生活上的沉悶，我們迴想到從前在學校時候的生活，是多麽驚奇有趣。要是一個女學生，不知道尋覓驚奇有趣的事情的，人家就會替她起個渾號，呌做（老太婆）的。婦女一生精神上的食糧，就是驚奇的事情。要是她感覺到世界事物的驚奇有趣，她的心境就老了。心境一老，她的容顔，亦就凋謝了！所以女子精神上的（警醒），就是保持美容的要訣。</p>
<p>（有人説這些話都是女明星們所發的理論，因爲做女明星的，她的生活本來是富於驚奇興趣的。並且她有機會，有金錢，有工夫去尋覓驚奇的事物。但是一個家庭婦女，就無法去尋覓驚奇了。這種話是似而非的。家庭婦女最大的毛病，並不是她們不能尋覓生活上的驚奇而是她們不去尋。驚奇的本質不過（雙換）二字而已。她們悶沉沉的伏處斗室，無論行動思想，一些都不想變動，於是她們的青春，都消磨在沉悶空氣之中了。她們或者看見她們的丈夫，喜悦那些年齡比她們自己大的女子，而覺得莫名其妙。不知道那種女子，年齡雖比她們自己大，而在精神上，思想上，却比她們後生也。</p>
<p>（講到（變換）這兩個字，本來是可以大小由之的。大之可以説宇宙之間，充滿了各式各樣的驚奇的事物，可以振刷我們的精神，活潑我們的身體的。卽如游戲中的競爭，書本中的記載，日日所接觸的人物，到處所看到的山水，各人良好的嗜好，凡可以使你精神愉快的，都可以算是驚奇的事物。但這些東西，萬不可以用來使你的精神厭倦。凡事如吃美味，初吃味道甚好，吃飽則厭倦。所以無論運動，遊戲，讀書，交友，遊歷，總不可使盡興，應當適可而止，再換調新鮮的，更有趣的東西。如果你是個家庭婦女，從小裏説，就是在一家之内，將傢俱的位置，過一些時就更變更變地位，一切擺設，亦更換更換式樣，亦足使你的精神爽快些。這當然，這是不用化許多錢的。</p>
<p>（女子的地位，不一定在家裏。所以你家庭裏的變動，不足以限制你尋求驚奇的活動。你可以尋些户外的運動，交幾個新朋友，看看新景緻。這亦不是説你應當喜新厭舊，而是更增加愛好舊友的方法。無論是一種遊戯，一本書，或是一位朋友，相處太久了，就會厭倦的。但是换了一種新遊戯，讀一本新書，交一個新朋友，你們對於舊的東西，非但可以維持良好的印象，並且隔了些時；好像舊友久别重逢，興趣必定更加濃厚些，而精神上亦不至厭倦了。）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評（情天碧血）</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>Flying　Devils</p>
<p>（美國影片眞給人看得膩了，又是這麽一個戀愛故事。）　　我想凡是看多了美國電影之戀愛把戲的人們，誰都有些感覺的。的確，美國影片在這一方面眞翻不起什麽新花樣來了。甲男愛乙女，丙男從中吃醋，最後一定是吃醋者死於非命，或是甘心退讓，於是乎有情人偕老團圓。這樣的故事我們看過無數遍了。公式總是一樣的，無非是將主人翁的名字改換幾次，或者戀愛事件所發生的背景不同而已。譬如這裏所述的是一隊飛行團，團員愛上了團主的夫人，而夫人亦因丈夫之暴戾而琵琶别抱，到後來團主因妒而懷殺心，結果自己反以身殉，於是團員和夫人團圓。</p>
<p>一個平凡而庸俗的故事啊！</p>
<p>不過在演出方面，也有些可取的地方，不妨具體的記之如下：</p>
<p>（一）導演對於幾個主要人物的心理描寫，總算還好。飾主婦的Arline　Judge，我們在好些片子中，證明她有着表演嫻靜，不苟嬉笑的特長，而在這裏尤爲適當。當她在劇中發現了那少年團員之後，不久便一往情深，而被暴戾的丈夫所磨折而成爲心灰意懶，那種無所謂的心境，使人感覺可愛而又可憐。當她一而洗衣，一面聽着青年彈着和悦的琴聲的時候，凡有着與她同樣的生活經騐的人們，一定會因之凄然無語。而少年團員因洗衣機而誤輾傷了她的手指，她只輕微的呼痛，毫無怨恨，可謂細膩之至。又如在月夜偕少年駕機遨游之時，她那快樂的心情，也只是倚於少年胸懷而盡情流露。至於簽名於相片贈客時的媚眼，却又流露她原有的風情。……這些地方，都是值得學習之處。</p>
<p>（二）團主的暴戾，以及因妻子之移情而悲哀，在酒館中幾塲都很可取。又如在山間小屋中發現床上只有一枕，完全明瞭妻子的曖昧，其憤怒的隠藏，也是導演聰明之處、</p>
<p>（三）對於飛機表演之新聞片的剪接，也很適當可取。　　至於有些缺點，我們也必須指出：</p>
<p>（一）團主死後，給與觀衆的刺戟，到底不甚輕微，苟如此End，可使人留有餘味，可是導演却脱不了美國影片一般的俗套，來一個大團圓，却使人感覺不調和的庸俗。然而故事總要有結束的，不過如此結束到底不見精采。</p>
<p>（二）劇的調子太平，雖然有些飛機表演的場面，如主婦開始發現少年有死的危險之時，即犯呼奔告少年之兄，頗見緊張，但在極平的情調中，始終是小小的嚴肅而已。</p>
<p>其他如月夜飛行時的攝影極佳，對話也很簡潔，一般的説，都還可以。</p>
<h3>（桂花律師）評Love，Honor　and　Oh　Baby</h3>
<p>— 摩爾</p>
<p>（桂花律師）是一張笑片。笑片在觀衆之間，一般的説來，都是注意（風趣）上的。因此，有許多完全不合理的故事，只要説是（笑片），觀衆就不再發議論了。實際無論如何，藝術總是通過了人類而産生的，即使不合理的故事我們只要仔細考察他的（意識），還是明明白白的。不説别的。即如爲什麽而製作者要創造這種不合理的故事。爲什麽這個故事是具道個形態。這些已經説明了製作的（觀念）問題了。</p>
<p>（桂花律師）旣是笑片，他的題材廳該採取較輕鬆的，可是（桂花律師）的故事重義却是極嚴重的。（律師營業不振，女友柯尼介紹一件訴訟案給他，而經過他打消。其後柯尼就投身於大銀行家處爲女職員），意思是（欲懲其辜）。她的（懲辜）的方法是（虚與委蛇）使他－銀行家－（受寵若驚）終於在（貽以麗服）的時候，爲律師和另一個朋友所獲，依法起訴，罰金十萬，大决人心，律師之名大噪。在這故事裏，我們看到：</p>
<p>第一·柯尼的行爲簡直是（念秧）而近於仙人跳的勾當。</p>
<p>第二·律師的才能只是捉獲送衣服給柯尼的銀行家。</p>
<p>第三·在目前的美國社會之下，男朋友送一套衣服給女子，就認爲有罪，而可以（依法起訴）。</p>
<p>以上這三點，除了最後一點，是製作者無法收束而（亂來）一下外，第一第二兩點，却是現社會的一種内在的暴露，并且相當的辛辣。</p>
<p>自然製作者並不是有意這樣做的，他首先把律師寫成個（息事寗人）的（好人），最後又在銀行家上當之後，緊接著因爲銀行家（平日惡聲載道，所以人心大快）的説明和畫面，可見得製作者是同情律師和柯尼的。還有一點，我們得嚴重的指出，就是製作者寫銀行家的上當，只是對於（惡聲載道）的人們個别的層惡，而不是對於銀行家一般的仇恨，假使這點不弄清楚，是絶對把握不住這張（桂花律師）的社會根據的。</p>
<p>至於（滑稽片）的本身，首先就要含有辛辣的諷剌，纔不至變爲一無價值的作品，這是大家所知道的。所以在技術上，笑片第一要故事組織的可笑，假使這點没有做到，而只是幾個怪臉，只在跌幾交上用功夫，充其量不過給淺薄的觀衆，暫時的笑樂。不幸（桂花律師）恰恰中了這個弊病，因此簡直成了一張（胡閙）片子。</p>
<p>我們知道導演，對於演員的動作上，是有着决定的支配權的，在並通影片，演員首先要自然，不能過于做作，而滑稽片也同樣的需要自然，不過在自然中要做出有可笑的地方來，像小孩子的行動，本來非常自然的；但有的地方却是（滑稽）而引人發笑的。導演笑片的人，應該注意這種地方。（桂花律師）的主角本來很有名的，不過有的動作太做作了，這是導演的失敗。至於故事開展的平穏，鏡頭角度的斟酌，都是他不可抹煞的成績。</p>
<h3>不許兎進來</h3>
<p>— 汪竹影</p>
<p>（No　Rabbits　Allowed）</p>
<p>在這裏，我講一個很滑稽的故事給諸君聽，我相信諸君一定是認爲有趣味的。這是美國的著名銀星賈克奥凱（JacOakic）和仇弟絲亞林（Juditb　Arleny閙的笑話。</p>
<p>有一天，他倆正要到公司裏去工作。但正在動身的時候，仇弟絲，忽然奔到後園裏去找那隻新買的一隻小兎子。</p>
<p>（找尋什麽，仇弟絲？）</p>
<p>（找尋那隻我最心愛的兎子。）</p>
<p>（做什麽？）</p>
<p>（我要帶牠到攝影塲裏去玩玩！）</p>
<p>（仇弟絲，我看還是把牠放在家裏吧，兎子是經不起我們玩弄的！）</p>
<p>賈克奥凱這樣的很忠實的對她説着，可是她并不能接受賈克奥凱的話，依然興奮的找尋着。結果，是被她尋到了。於是她便驕傲的對賈克奥凱説：</p>
<p>（牠現在旣屬於我的了，我是要始終愛護牠的。我不是不能離開牠，我離開了牠心裏老是不忍！）</p>
<p>這一來，賈克奥凱是没有話兒可説了。然而他覺得帶兎子到公司裏去是很危險的。因爲他想到了公司裏的許多小狗，狗是與兎子勢不兩立的東西。那末，仇弟絲這隻兎子送到公司裏，那許多小狗，一定要起來追逐的。那時膽小的兎兒，不嚇得半死嗎？賈克想到這裏，心裏很不安起來。</p>
<p>（公司裏小狗這樣的多，照我的意思，還是把兎兒放在家裏吧。假使你帶了進去，不消説，一定要吃虧的。）</p>
<p>（不會！不會！）</p>
<p>在這時，他倆都沉默着，一步一步走近了公司的門前。恰巧，那時正是美國復興運動的開端，全國所共同認爲復興的標幟是一面方形的旗，上面畫了一隻藍鷹，鷹的上面冩了“ＮＲＡ”三個字母。聰明的賈克奥凱，正在尋不出相當辦法的時候，猛然看了公司門前掛了這面復興運動的旗，於是心機一動，他就對仇弟絲道：（仇弟絲，你看！那旗上寫的“ＮＲＡ”就是“rl”“No　Rabbits　Allowed”（兎子不准進來。）的縮寫。他們已在警告你，你還要把兎子帶進去嗎？）</p>
<p>（事實上旣是不能，那末牠祗好不進去了。）仇弟絲説着，就把兎子放在外面，空着身子進去了。</p>
<p>到現在，仇弟絲才知道是上了賈克奥凱的當，可是她細細的玩味過去的事，她覺得他的愛護那兎子是跟自己一樣的，於是也就原諒他了。</p>
<h3>電影小説花蕚情深（Ｌittle　Woman）（七）</h3>
<p>— 素因</p>
<p>勞萊伸進頭來催着媽嬭，他一眼看見奇奥的後腦，頭髮光秃秃的，但他亦没有説話的工夫。他就扶着馬區夫人上馬車去了。四個姑娘送到門口，媽嬭呌着Ｌ（心肝寳貝們，再會吧！上帝照應你們吧）！她們默然地站着，擺着手，直等馬車走遠了看不見了，她們纔一個一個拭着眼涙進去了。</p>
<p>在悲苦愁悶之中，惟有辛勤工作，可以傻人减輕一切醋楚，因此他們自從媽嬭去後，就大家巴巴給給地工作着其中蓓絲的每日工作是去到那受他們聖誕日早餐的人家，帮着他們料理料理。有一天，奇奥從姑母家裏回來，看見蓓絲默然獨自坐在媽嬭房裡。她看見她臉色蒼白，眼睛睜得很大，連忙問她在做什麽。蓓絲哭了出來了，她説那個孩子死了。奇奥問她什麽孩子。她説漢姆爾家的孩子，并且説自從媽嬭走了之後，她天天上她家裏去照料她的小孩子。那個孩子。就是死在她懷裏的，而那孩子的毛病是猩紅熱。蓓絲的臉靠在奇奥的臉上，奇奥覺得她的臉，已經燒得滾燙，知道她已經受了傳染，連忙呌她躺下。一面呌漢娜本請醫生、一面呌勞萊來將亞梅送到她姑母家裏去，因爲亞梅没有得過那種病，是一定要傳染的。亞梅起初還不肯去，她説寗可死在家裏不願意去受她姑母的氣。可是經過奇奥和勞萊的百般哀求，她才答應了。一回醫生來了，奇奥和美格嚇得面無人色，你看着找，我看着你。</p>
<p>奇奥説：（她要是死了，我也不活了。她天天到漢姆爾家去，我怎麽一些都不知道。那是應當我去的。）美格説：（那不是你的差，是我的差。我年紀最大，我答應媽嬭我要照顧你們的。）她自己咬着嘴唇，心中有無限的痛苦··但是要不要打電報給媽嬭呢。她們就呌了漢娜來，和她商量着。漢娜反對打電報。她説：（媽嬭一定離不開你的父親的。要是她接了你們的電報，豈不使她急死了。）她們没有法子，祗好依了漢娜的話了。</p>
<p>這種凄風苦雨的日子，一天一天的過去。一方面惦記着遠處的父親，一方面害怕着眼前她們最鍾愛的妹妹。後來華盛頓拍來的電報説她們父親的病勢减輕，可是依舊不能减輕她的愁苦，因爲蓓絲的病勢，一天比一天沉重了。以至於美格和奇奥不敢相對而視了，因爲各人心中藴藏着一種恐怖，深怕人家看出來。醫生的臉，亦一天比一天嚴肅了。他有一天，忍不住了。他説：（要是馬區夫人可以暫時離開她丈夫的話，我們最好還是打電報請她回來吧。）漢娜心痛地絞着自己的手道：（這都是我呌她們不要打電報的。她們早就想打了。）奇奥和美格呢，到了這個當兒，互相抱着發抖。她們下樓送了醫生回來，經過客堂，從前歡笑娛衆之地，現在已是音塵寂寂，無限蒼凉似的。她們向四週看着，默然無語，但聽得窗外雨聲浙瀝，打在玻璃窗上，使她們凄然涙下了。（未完）</p>

<h3>Zhang Ji and Others Arrive in Hong Kong, Discuss the Current Situation with Hu Hanmin, Urging Hu to Go to Beijing, But Hu Still Declines, Executive Department Sends Personnel to Welcome Zhang and Others</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) The four representatives, Zhang, Ma, Chen, and Wang, arrived in Hong Kong at 7 AM on the 11th aboard the President Pierce. Zhang told reporters on the ship that Chen Mingshu and Li Jishen had betrayed the Party and the nation. The Central Government, in order to unite all comrades within the Party and save the Party and the nation together, has sent us to the south. Our mission has five points: (1) To convey the meaning of the Central Government; (2) To explain the current political situation of the Central Government; (3) To exchange opinions on the current situation with all comrades; (4) To discuss methods of correction of the Fujian Incident, and (5) To urge comrades in the south to go to Beijing to attend the Fourth Plenary Session. We will first visit Hu Hanmin and then go to Guangzhou to visit Guangdong comrades. If time permits, we will also go to Wuzhou or Yongzhou to visit Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi. We hope to return to Beijing before the Fourth Plenary Session. Li Liejun's proposal to open up the government is fundamentally opposed by us. As for asking Wang Jingwei and Chiang Kai-shek to step down, that is also not a fundamental policy to save the country, he said. Zhang and others landed and stayed at the Hong Kong Hotel, receiving representatives from Guangdong such as Liu Luyin and Chen Rong. Zhang and others are scheduled to depart by train for Guangzhou at 4 PM on the 12th. (11th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Lin Yizhong and Liu Jiwen,奉under the order of the Executive Department, arrived in Hong Kong on the evening of the 11th to welcome Zhang Ji and others to Guangzhou. Li Haoju and Jian Youwen remain in Guangdong, waiting to meet Zhang and others. (11th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Zou Lu said on the 11th that negotiations will continue with Zhang and others who have come south. If the Central Government adopts their suggestions, there will be a satisfactory outcome. (11th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Zhang Ji telegraphed Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi, inviting them to meet in Wuzhou, and will go to Guangdong Province on the evening of the 12th. The four will go to Wuzhou together, and return to Beijing with Li Fulin before the 20th. According to reports, the result of the visit to Hu Hanmin was that they agreed on the idea of saving the country, and the specific methods will be discussed later. (11th New Sound News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) After disembarking, Fu Bingchang went directly to visit Hu Hanmin to introduce Zhang Ji and others. The four visited Hu at 3 PM in the afternoon, talking for two hours, urging Hu to go to Beijing and unite with Chiang and Wang. Hu still humbly declined. Hu's liver disease has not yet healed, and he was very energetic during the conversation. In the evening at 7 PM, a Mr. Zhou hosted a vegetarian dinner for Hu at Hu's residence, and invited Zhang and others to attend. (9th New Sound News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Zhang Ji Discusses Five Missions of Coming South</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) The four committee members dispatched by the Central Government to come south, Zhang Ji, Ma Chaojun, Chen Zhaoying, and Wang Luyi, arrived in Hong Kong on the morning of the 11th aboard the President Pierce. The Central News Agency reporter met with them on the ship and they gave the following statement: We were dispatched by the Standing Committee of the Central Government and took the ship south on the 9th, arriving safely here this morning. We are deeply grateful for Mr. Lao Pu's long-distance welcome. The Central Government believes that during this period of serious national crisis, it is hoped that all comrades will unite sincerely to overcome the current difficulties. Unexpectedly, Chen Mingshu, Li Jishen, and others have taken actions to betray the Party and harm the country. Observing their absurd and chaotic coalition, colluding with strong enemies externally and communicating with insurgents internally, they are in fact heading for self-destruction. What is even more heartbreaking is that believers of the Three Principles of the People for many years have been shaken by heresies, daring to commit great immoralities. Comrades in the south, in order to protect the lifeline of the Party and the nation and uphold revolutionary justice, have resolutely denounced them, correcting the vision of Party members and the people of the country. In addition to being gratified, the Central Government is striving for the sincere unity of responsible comrades within the Party, hoping to save the country. All leaders and comrades have followed the Premier for many years, sharing hardships and resisting slander. Having personally participated in suppressing the rebellion, they also bear the responsibility of founding the country. At this time, we must think deeply together, seek a way out for the country and the nation, endure all unbearable hardships, and accept all necessary blame. The so-called "misfortune makes a nation prosper" may not be far off. This is what the comrades in the Central Government expect of themselves, and it is also what the comrades in the south sympathize with. Therefore, our mission this time is: first, to convey the will of the Central Government; second, to explain the recent situation of the Central Government's administration; third, to exchange opinions on the current situation with comrades in the south; fourth, to discuss methods to correct the Fujian Incident; and fifth, the Fourth Plenary Session will be held soon, and we urge all comrades in the south to go to Beijing to attend and jointly plan the country's affairs. We especially hope for sincere unity and concerted efforts, so that we can gain the loyal trust of the people, stabilize the situation, and overcome difficulties, so that the country and the nation can have a chance to survive. After arriving here, we will first visit Mr. Hu Hanmin and convey the sincere regards of our colleagues in the Central Government. Mr. Hu is a veteran in the Party, and his concerns and warnings will surely be words of great wisdom that the people of the country are willing to hear. After visiting Mr. Hu, we will go to Yuzhou to visit Chen Bonan and other comrades. If time permits, we will also go to Wuzhou or Nanning to visit Li Delin and other comrades. We hope that this trip will have good results, to report back to the Central Government and to reassure the people. When the Fourth Plenary Session opens, we hope to be able to rush back. The mission we have undertaken on this trip to the south has been fully stated here, and it is absolutely true and without embellishment. After Zhang and others finished speaking, when asked whether the Fujian Incident could be reconciled, Zhang replied that Chen, Li, and others changed the national flag and altered the national system, which is not only betraying the Party but also betraying the country. What reconciliation can there be? When asked about the Central Government's opinion on Li Xiehe's proposal to open up the government, Zhang replied that he did not know the Central Government's opinion, but he personally did not approve of it. He believed that advocating the opening up of the government was a mistake, because in the Premier's teachings, there is only democracy, not so-called government. We only strive to realize democracy as soon as possible, and do not need to talk about opening up the government, deceiving ourselves and others. When asked about Zhang's impressions of Guangzhou and Nanjing, Zhang replied that he had been to Guangdong more than ten times, and each time he had a good impression. He regarded Guangdong as the revolutionary hometown, and this time he was returning to his hometown, not a so-called stranger. Moreover, his hometown is much better, and everything feels familiar. You are all brothers from the revolutionary hometown and should work harder to quell the Fujian rebellion and save the country from disaster, so as not to let down the honor of our revolutionary hometown. After speaking, at the request of the reporters, they took a group photo on the deck. At 9:15, accompanied by the welcoming party, they disembarked and stayed at the Hong Kong Hotel. At 11:00, they met with representatives of various Guangdong agencies and Ms. Mulan, Hu's representative, and had lunch at the hotel. In the afternoon at 1:00, they met with Hu to discuss everything.

However, the Central Army is well prepared, and the bandits will definitely not succeed. (11th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) According to warnings received here, the communist army in southern Jiangxi is taking advantage of the Fujian Incident to become active again. The situation in Sannan and Xunwu is very critical, and battles may break out at any time.

The authorities, for precautionary reasons, have sent reinforcements to the borders of Fujian, Jiangxi, and Guangdong. The Second and Fourth Divisions have been ordered to go to the eastern front, and the troops stationed in Nanxiong have been transferred to Anyuan to strengthen defenses. (11th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Guangzhou Communist Disaster Memorial Day, Wang Jingwei Delivers Important Speech, The Guangzhou Communist Disaster Was One of the Most Tragic Scenes of Struggle in a Pincer Attack, Soldiers Who Used to Falsely Accuse Comrades of Being Communists and Kill Them Are Now Openly Colluding with Communists in Rebellion, Central Committee Members Who Used to Use Soldiers' Knives to Eliminate Dissidents Are Now Taking Advantage of the Fujian Incident</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Today is the memorial day of the Guangzhou Communist Disaster. Wang Jingwei delivered an important speech, the full text of which is as follows:</p>
<p>(After the Wuhan comrades cleared the communists in July of the 16th year, they knew that they were in a position of being besieged. The article "Struggling in a Pincer Attack" represents and explains this meaning. A pincer attack is a tragic term, not a heroic one. Afterwards, countless comrades have continuously sacrificed in this pincer attack. The Guangzhou Communist Disaster is its most tragic scene. However, our comrades would rather be defeated in a pincer attack for a time than compromise with any party in order to survive. On the occasion of the sudden outbreak of the Communist Disaster on December 11th, we deeply blamed ourselves for negligence beforehand and resolutely encouraged ourselves to do our best to suppress it. Within three days, Guangzhou was recovered. The motives and actions of the planners can be made known to the world. However, the dissidents of the time were bound to punish them and remove them all to be satisfied. Today, the military leaders who used to falsely accuse comrades of being communists and kill them like hemp, are now openly colluding with the communists in Fujian to attack the Republic of China and the Chinese Nationalist Party. And the central committee members who used to falsely accuse comrades of being communists and use the knives of military leaders to eliminate dissidents are now watching the Fujian Incident as if across the river, not only not thinking about extinguishing it, but wanting to use its prairie fire to expel dissidents. Thinking of this, I feel pain in my heart. Only when comrades unite and persevere in their original intentions can we attack the united front of counter-revolutionaries with all our strength to save the people from danger and save the country from great calamities. I sincerely tell you this, hoping we can encourage each other), (11th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Yin Tong Goes to Beijing to Visit Gu, Negotiates Beining Railway Issue, Traffic Negotiations Cease</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Yin Tong, the director of the Beining Railway Bureau, arrived in Beijing on the afternoon of the 11th and will visit Gu Menyu to discuss the issue of traffic on the railway. (11th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Yin Tong went south to report to the Ministry of Railways on the situation of railway administration after taking office as the director of the Beining Railway Bureau. The rumors that the Ping-Shen railway would open to traffic on New Year's Day are probably unreliable. (11th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Yin Tong said that the opening of the Beining Railway to traffic was one of the conditions put forward by the other party during the North China Agreement. At that time, traffic could only reach Tangshan. After many negotiations, it finally reached Shanhaiguan. However, because the conditions put forward by the Japanese and puppet regimes were too far apart, although I drafted several principles for opening to traffic, I decided to stop the negotiations because I could not reach an agreement. The task of my trip to Beijing is: (1) The Beining Railway has been built for 57 years. When the railway was built, the section from Tangshan to Xugezhuang was only for transporting coal to the port. After years of construction, it was extended to outside the pass, but the equipment is simple, especially the lack of freight stations. After being responsible for transportation, it is extremely necessary to add them. (2) The Luanhe Railway Bridge has long passed its insurance period and has been damaged several times in the war and twice. Because the locomotive has been weighted and the 85-pound rails have been replaced, it is even more dangerous. Moreover, the bridge is still single-track and needs to be repaired and rebuilt. (3) The platforms along the Beining Railway are all very short, and the trains are gradually lengthening, making it difficult to load and unload goods and for passengers to get on and off. Therefore, they must be rebuilt or lengthened. (4) The Beining Railway Bureau currently has more than 20,000 employees, but there is no railway hospital, which is very inconvenient. This hospital also needs to be added. As for other issues, since two-thirds of the Beining Railway is currently occupied by the Japanese and puppet regimes, only one-third of it is open to traffic within the customs. In addition, the Kailuan Coal Mining Company has recently reduced its coal transportation, resulting in a monthly income of only 1.2 to 1.3 million yuan for the entire railway. After deducting the salaries of employees, which amounts to over 580,000 yuan, and remitting 150,000 yuan in military expenses to the Peiping Military Sub-Council, there is very little left to repay the railway's own foreign debts and add materials. This time, after I have negotiated with the Ministry of Railways, I must return to Peiping within three to five days. (11th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Sun Dianying's Troops Will Open Up the Wilderness for the Winter, Has Obtained Yan Xishan's Consent</h3>
<p>(Peiping) Wang Baoping, the director of Sun Dianying's office in Peiping, said that after our army was ordered to temporarily stop its westward advance, the various units are now stationed in Baotou, Wuyuan, Linhe, and Yangshu, Mutou, Sanshenggong, and Junliangtai to the west. However, there are too few houses in Wuyuan and other places, and the winter is very windy and sandy. Military tents are difficult to withstand the weather. We have repeatedly negotiated with Yan Xishan to temporarily move to the Woye Special District in western Suiyuan. Yan has agreed to move to the area. Our army is now actively preparing to move more than 30,000 troops from Wuyuan, Linhe, Yangshu, Mutou, Sanshenggong, and Junliangtai to the Woye area after the new year. In the future, the military headquarters plans to be located in the Woye Special District Management Bureau in the area. The Woye Special District is about 500 li from north to south and more than 200 li from east to west. In the future, our army will rent land and build houses there to carry out reclamation work. After our army departs from Wuyuan, Linhe, and other places, a small number of soldiers will be left to guard them, forming a liaison line with the Baotou Woye Special District. I am scheduled to visit He Yingqin this afternoon to report everything. (11th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Chen Youren's Reply to Reuters Reporter on Various Issues in the Fujian New Policy: Only a Portion of the Three Principles of the People is Adopted; Refrains from Explicitly Acknowledging Alignment with the Communists</h3>
<p>(Fuzhou) The Reuters special correspondent in Fuzhou visited Chen Youren and inquired about the following questions, to which he answered one by one as follows: (1) What is the government's agricultural land policy and agricultural credit? (Answer) Trotsky once said that farmers are the packhorses of culture, and this is especially true of Chinese farmers. The new government will recognize the actual position of farmers. Chinese farmers are producers, accounting for the majority of the national population and the foundation of social culture. The national farmers number 300 million, accounting for the majority of farmers in the Far East. All food and raw materials come from farmers. This is not unique to China; farmers in other countries are also numerous. Therefore, our national policy and agricultural policy will take the concept of Chinese farmers as the standard. We will grant them land, not for land ownership, but to enable them to have land for production. Usurious loans will be prohibited. Farmers' banks will be established, and at the same time, the organization of cooperatives will be promoted. (2) What is the government's attitude towards private industry, church property, and cultivated tenant land? (Answer) The government has no intention of interfering with private property, except when necessary for the implementation of the government's agricultural policies and for the benefit of the nation. At the same time, we must strictly prevent the economic and social symptoms of free capitalism in other industrialized countries from occurring in China. The government has no intention of interfering with church groups, but their religious beliefs and educational activities must not violate Chinese law. (3) What is the government's attitude towards unearned income? (Answer) The government has no specific decision on this matter, but I personally agree that any increase in income caused by the actions of public consumer groups should be distributed by the state and not controlled by landlords. (4) What is the government's financial policy? In recent years, the financial situation in Fujian Province has not been self-sufficient. Will taxes be increased? (Answer) The biggest reason why Fujian Province has not been self-sufficient over the years is that tax revenue is too low. The situation in other parts of China is the same. The current government will vigorously rectify tax collection and hold tax officials accountable for their integrity. It is imperative to levy new taxes and increase taxes such as kerosene imports. Such tax increases are not difficult in the process of revolution. (5) Will Fujian Province withhold customs duties or will they still be sent to Nanjing by the Customs Service, and will they be withheld only after the major powers recognize the new government? (Answer) It has been decided to withhold customs duties in Fujian Province. (6) The Fujian branch of the Central Bank has been sealed. Will the government set up another central bank? (Answer) The government is currently designing and preparing to establish a bank to benefit the people of Fujian Province. (7) The government has declared that all mines, forests, and wasteland will be nationalized. Under what conditions will the government welcome foreign investment? (Answer) The government is still seeking to determine the conditions for foreign investment in the development of China's original wealth, but in general, all investments that do not harm national sovereignty are welcome. (8) What will be the government's future educational policy? If the Three Principles of the People are abolished, what will replace them? If Confucius's doctrines are not promoted, what kind of knowledge will replace them? (Answer) The government's educational policy is to promote universal education and raise the level of public knowledge, with particular attention to civic and vocational education. The Three Principles of the People is the bible of the Kuomintang, but we believe that this is only a record of speeches made by Mr. Sun Yat-sen in 1924 by his secretary. Confucius's doctrines will be adopted in part, just as the Three Principles of the People will not be completely abolished. The doctrines used to replace them will be social knowledge and social doctrines derived from life experience, with particular emphasis on the fundamental knowledge of philosophy to explore the human mind. (9) Will trade unions be organized? (Answer) The government will protect the fundamental rights of the people, such as freedom of assembly and association. Trade unions organized by workers will also be protected. (10) Section 3 of the declaration issued by the Fujian government on the 20th of last month declared that it would unite all anti-imperialist and anti-Nanjing revolutionary forces. Does this section imply that the Fujian government has contacted the communists in Jiangxi Province? Otherwise, what do the anti-imperialist and anti-Nanjing revolutionary forces refer to? (Answer) In addition to the communists in Jiangxi Province, there are many anti-imperialist and anti-Nanjing forces in China. Broadly speaking, the entire Chinese nation, except for a small part of the people who rely on unequal treaties for survival, opposes all forms of international supervision created by unequal treaties.

<h3>Dalai Lama Obeys Orders to Cease Military Actions; Talk by the Secretary-General of the Mongolian-Tibetan Affairs Commission</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Xie Baicheng, Secretary-General of the Mongolian-Tibetan Affairs Commission, said that regarding the Dalai Lama's establishment of customs and tax collection on the border between Qinghai and Tibet, in addition to submitting a request to the Executive Yuan and the Qinghai Provincial Government to negotiate with the Tibetan side to stop it, the commission also ordered the Dalai Lama's representative, Gongjue Zhongni, to send a telegram requesting its withdrawal. As for the conflict between Kang and Tibet, the commission had previously sent a telegram ordering both parties to abide by the provisions of last year's peace treaty, with the east and west sides of the Jinsha River as the boundary, and not to invade each other. On the 10th, a telegram was received from the Dalai Lama stating that he had obeyed the order and instructed the front line to cease military actions. (Special Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Dalai Lama telegraphed his representatives in Nanjing, saying that according to government inquiries, the monks and masses of the Dazhong Temple in Kang Province have lost their homes and become bandits, constantly harassing villages and looting merchants. Their temples have been destroyed and their lives have no support, so it is difficult to stop the bandits. Moreover, if the two places of Dege and Yarong occupied by Sichuan are not returned, although the front line has been repeatedly instructed to abide by peace, it is difficult to predict whether changes will occur in the area. Details will be notified after receiving reports from Xikang. (Special Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<h3>Liu Zhenhua Asks the Central Government to Increase the Appropriation for Anhui Relief</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) When Ma Fuxiang was the chairman of the Anhui Provincial Government, the central government provided 200,000 yuan per month for relief. After Wu Zhongxin succeeded as chairman, it was reduced to 150,000 yuan. Since Liu Zhenhua became the chairman of Anhui, the monthly relief has been reduced to 50,000 yuan. Liu, facing financial difficulties, sent Mao Longzhang, the director of finance, to Beijing to request the central government to allocate 200,000 yuan according to the original plan. He also went to Shanghai to meet with Finance Minister Kong, and the result was good. Mao will return to the province in the next few days. (Special Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<h3>Party, Government, and Military Expenses for This Month Have Been Raised; Chiang Kai-shek Urges Raising Funds for Suppressing Bandits; Ministry of Finance Plans to Allocate 600,000 Yuan First</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to the Ministry of Finance, Finance Minister Kong went to Shanghai the week before to raise funds and decided to return to Beijing on the evening of the 11th. It is reported that the central party, government, and military expenses for this month have been raised and will be issued in advance to allow civil servants to spend the end of the year. Although a part of the customs and salt taxes has been intercepted by Fujian recently, due to the peak season, the two taxes still increased by about 2 million yuan compared to normal. (Special Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, considering the need to deal with the aftermath of bandit suppression in the four provinces, previously asked President Wang to allocate 1.8 million yuan to address the symptoms and another 15 million yuan to address the root causes. The Central Political Council approved the proposal as it was. The 15 million yuan for addressing the root causes and the 1.8 million yuan for addressing the symptoms were ordered to be allocated by the Ministry of Finance as soon as possible. After receiving the order, the Ministry of Finance had difficulty raising the funds for a while and telegraphed Chairman Chiang, tentatively agreeing to advance 200,000 yuan for emergency use. After receiving the telegram, Chiang considered it a drop in the bucket and of no help. Moreover, military advances and the work of post-war symptom management could not be delayed. He telegraphed President Wang and Minister Kong again, asking them to allocate the 1.8 million yuan for symptom management in three months, despite any difficulties. President Wang and Minister Kong have agreed to have the Ministry of Finance allocate 600,000 yuan first for the use of post-war symptom management in the four provinces of Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, and Anhui, with the remaining funds to be raised and allocated successively in the next two months. (Special Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to the Ministry of Finance, after the expenses of the various armies in North China were reduced, 4 million yuan was still needed each month. The previous arrears were already large, and the demand for funds at the end of the year was even more urgent. The ministry has been discussing with the Ministry of Military Affairs to raise funds for December and plans to remit them all at once before the new year. (Special Dispatch, 11th)</p>

<h3>Commentary: Caution Regarding Yellow River Management and River Dredging</h3>
<p>Since Yu the Great dredged the nine rivers of the Yellow River, few have had a correct understanding of it. In the fifth year of King Ding of Zhou, the river lost its original course and shifted south. During the Warring States period, the feudal lords competed to build dikes and dams, never considering the interests of future generations. As a result, the canals deteriorated. Since the Han Dynasty, breaches and overflows have been frequently heard, and floods have been a daily occurrence. As a result, the northern provinces, which were the first to be civilized and had very thick geological layers, have been in a state of temporary peace and have been unable to extricate themselves. Moreover, the rulers of later generations, even in times of unity and prosperity, only knew of temporary prosperity and honor and rarely considered the welfare of the country and the nation. The people were limited by their financial resources and did not dare to speak out of turn. As a result, the canals were not repaired, the geological layers were not cultivated, and the farmers became more and more impoverished.</p>
<p>If we try to travel through the provinces of Hebei, Shanxi, and Henan for a rough observation, we can understand the origins of the floods in the northern provinces. First, the main rivers dry up after the autumn floods. For example, the Fen River and the upper reaches of the Hutuo River only leave riverbeds in winter, which are almost like roads. They have completely lost their function of collecting water flow. Second, some large cities in the north, such as Taiyuan, have rivers near the city, but we have never heard of them being dredged. Once heavy rains strike, the low-lying streets become swamps. As a result, disasters occur frequently, and floods do not stop. Third, most of the northern provinces are alluvial deposits of sand and soil. The three provinces of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan are particularly prominent. Therefore, all rivers carry sediment, which stagnates everywhere. Natural changes are allowed to occur, and there is little artificial remediation. Even frequent blockages occur, causing more and more stagnation and more and more floods. With these three factors, the floods of the Yellow River have become more and more severe.</p>
<p>However, to talk about Yellow River management today, when the country is exhausted and the people are impoverished, it is nothing more than empty talk on paper and does not help the facts. Recently, it was heard that the Henan Construction Department plans to dredge five rivers. The Ministry of Finance sent a letter to the Economic Committee, stating that this would not only irrigate the land, but also benefit agriculture and navigation, change the soil quality, and indirectly boost salt tax revenue. Hydraulic engineers will conduct on-site surveys, and it may be implemented soon. Moreover, the Huiji River was originally the main river in southeastern Henan. After it was silted up, the effect of irrigation was lost and it was more likely to cause floods, which harmed agriculture. Recently, the Henan provincial authorities have started dredging, and 70% of the work has been completed. It will soon be possible to connect the Huiji and Jialu rivers. The long-parched river will regain the benefit of irrigation for farmland. However, the placement of siphon pipes on the Yellow River embankment is very weak and the amount of water is small. Using it for irrigation may be a drop in the bucket. If it is intended for navigation, it must have a large amount of water. Therefore, dredging canals is a good deed, but the sectional repair of the Yellow River is even more urgent. Otherwise, once the great river flows sideways, relying solely on the dredging of this small tributary will not be enough to withstand the great disaster.</p>
<p>As for the Wei River, it was originally one of the nine ancient courses of the Yellow River. The main stream of the Yellow River flowed from Wuzhi to Weihui via the Qin River, then northeast through Linqing in Shandong, past Tianjin, and into the sea along the Bai River. Weihui is still navigable today. From there upwards, it is gradually silted up. The Qin River has also turned into the Yellow River, losing its water conservancy benefits. Although the Henan Provincial Government has considered dredging the Wei River, it has not yet been started. We silently observe the current situation. For long-term stability and security, diverting the Yellow River into the Wei River is the most effective strategy. It not only diverts the sideways flow of the Yellow River, but also increases the source of the Wei River's drought. The only things to pay attention to are how to cut the Yellow River embankment and how to build water gates.</p>
<p>From a transportation perspective, the water transport of the Sui, Tang, and Song dynasties relied on the Tongji Canal in the south and the Yongji Canal in the north, both of which connected the Yellow River, reaching the Huai River in the south and the Bohai Sea in the north. They had a great impact on the regulation of merchants and the transportation of official goods. Recently, railways have gradually developed, and the country may not regard this as an urgent need. However, for local subsidies, it is of great benefit. The negative purpose of Yellow River management is to rescue disasters, so that floods do not cause harm again. The positive goal is to correct historical mistakes and facilitate navigation, which is secondary. The main goal is to improve the soil in the northern provinces and revive agriculture. Therefore, although the scope of benefits from Henan Province's dredging of five rivers is very narrow, if we can continue to work hard, it will not be difficult to start the difficult project of Yellow River management.</p>
<h3>Nationwide Chaos in Spain; Anarchists and Communists Launch Uprisings; Transportation Disrupted in Various Provinces, Many Dead and Injured</h3>
<p>Madrid: Anarchists across the country issued a manifesto yesterday, urging the people to destroy the state and seize banks and people's homes. The disturbances are getting worse. A horrifying message came from the province of Logroño: Communists seized the families of the security forces and forced them to lead the way. The Communists shot at the security forces from behind, making it impossible for the security forces to resist. It is now known that no less than 60 people have died in the riots, hundreds have been injured, and more than a thousand have been arrested. In Granada, one monastery and one church were completely destroyed, and six churches were set on fire by Communists. Cars were stopped everywhere, overturned, and passengers were taken hostage. A tragedy occurred outside the city of Valencia: Anarchists destroyed the road, causing an express train to overturn, killing 20 people and injuring more than 40. Anarchists first placed a bomb on the road bridge. As soon as the train head passed, the bomb exploded, and the passenger car fell into the ravine. The driver was the only one who was not injured. He walked several miles to the nearest station to report the alarm. The injured passengers groaned for four hours, witnessing the rioters demolishing the tracks to prevent rescue vehicles from arriving. One passenger was so frightened that he went mad. The center of the Red Army's activities seems to be in Zaragoza. The rioters there hid in church towers and on the roofs of houses, attacking downwards for 36 hours without stopping, causing many deaths and injuries. The governor today ordered the arming of volunteers to protect the monasteries. Many civilians are willing to serve as volunteers, and public office employees are also carrying hand grenades to defend themselves. It is reported that the garrison in the province of Badajoz mutinied this afternoon. In order to reconcile this matter and avoid bloodshed, the security forces sent personnel to contact the rebels. The rebels allowed the envoys to approach, but then opened fire, killing a junior officer and a person. Women were very active in the riots, secretly carrying pistols and ammunition to supply the rioters, avoiding the eyes and ears of the police. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<h3>Anarchists Announce General Strike</h3>
<p>Madrid: Revolutionary movements broke out in Catalonia and Zaragoza on Friday night and are continuing to gain momentum. The Anarchists issued a manifesto tonight, announcing that a revolutionary general strike will be implemented throughout Spain starting on Monday. The government is on high alert, fearing that reactionaries will collude with the Communist Party and socialist labor groups, expanding the situation. Officials here acknowledged tonight that since the riots broke out on Friday, ten people have died, 33 have been injured, and 300 have been arrested. However, the Minister of Labor told a United Press reporter that about 100 people had died and 300 had been injured. (National Telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>Madrid: Although the Spanish Cabinet claims that the rebellion has been contained, the situation is still serious and it is feared that martial law will be officially announced because it is feared that a general strike will be declared in Madrid. At the same time, the riots have spread to San Sebastian. Bomb explosions have repeatedly occurred in the suburbs. The authorities have sent troops to protect the railway line to Paris. It is now reported that this line has been cut off by Anarchists. News from the province of Barcelona says that the Communist Party has declared a general strike. Disturbances are also breaking out elsewhere. The rioters in Corbera de Llobregat attempted to seize the municipal bureau, but were repelled by soldiers, suffering many casualties. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>Madrid: The Spanish Minister of Labor told a United Press representative today that the riots that spread to twelve provinces at the end of the week are now under government control and all public forces in the country are loyal to the government. He also said that when the riots were at their worst, there were probably 100 deaths. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>Madrid: The Barcelona express train crashed and 30 passengers are now reported to have died. The Spanish revolutionary movement has now spread to eight provinces. British tourist groups are temporarily not coming to Spain until normalcy is restored. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<h3>Portuguese Government Worried About the Spread of Riots</h3>
<p>Lisbon: The Portuguese authorities are very worried about the anarchist riots in Spain, fearing that the riots will spread to Portugal. Opponents of the Salazar government have not been discouraged by the recent failure of the uprising in Braganza, insisting that there will inevitably be continued revolutionary movements in Portugal sooner or later, which is difficult to avoid. Many feel that the riots in the neighboring country may give the Portuguese Revolutionary Party an opportunity. The authorities have repeatedly declared that the entire Portuguese army is now unanimously willing to serve Prime Minister Salazar. However, since the military uprising in Braganza, the government's prestige has suffered a major blow. Recent overseas rumors that there has been a cabinet reshuffle in Portugal have been firmly denied by those with inside information. It is reported that Prime Minister Salazar recently held talks with senior military officers, who suggested that Salazar should remain Minister of Finance, but the position of Prime Minister should be given to a military officer. Later, Salazar declared that he was well aware that the army was now unanimously willing to help the government implement the dictatorship program, and to satisfy a portion of the military, a general election would be held next year to amend the constitution. Salazar also stated that he would abandon the defensive posture and take an offensive stance against the enemy parties that hindered the government's progress. Interior Minister Pilinha later said in a speech that the army was willing to be the government's unanimous backing. However, not even a week later, the Braganza riots suddenly broke out. Although the affair was unsuccessful, those who opposed the government still believed that they would eventually be able to overthrow the current government. (National Telegram, 11th)</p>

<h3>Avenol Meets Simon; Unexpectedly, the Deputy Foreign Minister Goes to Berlin; British Ambassador Has Not Yet Returned to Paris</h3>
<p>(London) The British Ambassador to France, Tyrrell, was originally scheduled to return to Paris yesterday. Because he wanted to meet Prime Minister MacDonald this morning to discuss disarmament, he did not make the trip. His contact with the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister can facilitate Anglo-French negotiations on disarmament. Foreign Secretary Simon hosted a tea party for League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol in the House of Commons today. After that, Simon and Avenol held secret talks. It is believed that Avenol will exchange views with British Cabinet members on disarmament and matters related to the future of the League of Nations. He is scheduled to meet British Prime Minister MacDonald and Baldwin on Wednesday. Paris people believe that British Ambassador Tyrrell's long stay in London is due to the British government encountering difficulties and not being able to decide its disarmament declaration. (Reuters, 11th) (London) While the U.S. Ambassador to France, Straus, set out to return to Paris, League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol arrived here tonight. According to well-informed sources, Tyrrell has been discussing the disarmament conference and direct disarmament negotiations with Prime Minister MacDonald and Foreign Secretary Simon.

<h3>U.S. Grand Naval Policy: Aiming for Perpetual Sharpness in Combat Power; Navy Department to Apply to Congress for Construction of New Vessels; Naval Personnel to Increase by at Least 5,000</h3>
<p>(Washington) According to Admiral Standley, Chief of Naval Operations, today, the Navy Department will apply in the next Congressional session to build new warships, so that by 1939, the power stipulated in the treaty can be achieved, and a long-term offsetting program can be implemented. Although public works funds can complete the warship construction program of US$238,000,000, if no additional warship construction funds are allocated, the US Navy will still be short of 101 warships, totaling 204,380 tons, by December 31, 1936, the deadline of the London Treaty. The Navy Department is currently considering several plans, the most important of which is to build an aircraft carrier and five light cruisers equipped with 6-inch guns. This plan will bring such warships to the limit stipulated by the naval treaty, requiring an expenditure of US$100,000,000. According to the treaty, the United States can build 65 destroyers and 30 submarines, but these funds are currently unavailable. Admiral Standley also stated that determining the strength of the navy is not the duty of the Navy Department personnel, but the privilege of the American people to be determined by their Congressional representatives. The duty of the Navy Department is to state the strength needed for the country to obtain adequate protection. The numbers stipulated in the London Naval Treaty have been accepted by Congress and the American people, but due to circumstances beyond our control, the strength of the navy has been slow to reach the limits stipulated in the treaty. The Navy Department now earnestly desires to formulate a complete program so that at the 1935 naval treaty signatories conference, in addition to building warships to the strength stipulated in the naval treaty, Navy Department personnel also advocate raising funds to maintain and renovate the existing fleet. The Navy Department's request for an appropriation of 77,000,000 yuan to renovate five battleships has been rejected by the Public Works Administration, but if Congress allocates additional public works funds in the future, the Navy Department still intends to apply to allocate funds from this sum for renovating and adding warships; otherwise, it will directly apply to Congress and intends to request funds for a continuous offsetting program to prevent borrowed ships from becoming ineffective due to old age. Battleships and cruisers are useless after 20 years, and destroyers and submarines should be considered obsolete after 15 years. Therefore, Navy Department personnel hope that when funds for warship construction are raised in the future, age should also be considered, with various new warships offsetting old ships, so that America's combat power will be perpetually sharp. In addition, the personnel of the existing fleet are more than 20% short of the required number, so Congress will be asked to find a way to remedy this as soon as possible, and at least restore the approximately 5,000 people laid off three years ago.

<h3>MacDonald Proposes: Franco-German Compromise; Germany Restores Part of its Military Equipment; and Enters into Non-Aggression Treaties with its Neighbors</h3>
<p>(London) Regarding the issue of European armaments, Britain recently expressed its willingness to allow Germany to partially rearm. However, on the other hand, the British government advocates that Germany and its neighboring countries conclude non-aggression treaties to provide safeguards. However, to satisfy France, it is not enough to rely solely on the protection of non-aggression treaties if it no longer opposes Germany's partial rearmament. The monitoring organization in the disarmament convention should be given special attention. If this agreement is to be practical, effective, and acceptable to all parties, a strict monitoring system must be established in order to reassure France. It is heard that Prime Minister Hitler has expressed his acceptance of the original disarmament plan proposed by British Prime Minister MacDonald. (Note: This plan was proposed in Geneva on March 16 of this year, advocating that the French army be limited to 450,000, the Italian army to 250,000, and the German army to 100,000 as restricted by the Treaty of Versailles, which could later be increased to 200,000. However, after Britain, France, and the United States met in London and Paris in September and October, Britain revised MacDonald's plan and submitted it to Geneva in October, which led to Germany's withdrawal from the disarmament conference.) MacDonald's original disarmament plan advocated a thorough study of the safeguards of the monitoring system. Although MacDonald's original plan did not have definite stipulations on how to study the monitoring system, in general, if the monitoring system can be implemented, this kind of safeguard will contribute to peace no less than a non-aggression treaty. This point was acknowledged in MacDonald's original plan. There are still many difficulties in implementing this plan, which is well known to the general public. However, the attitude expressed by Berlin is unlikely to oppose re-examining the monitoring issue. Therefore, London believes that the British government has ordered its ambassador to Germany, Sir Phipps, to request that this issue be raised for discussion at his next audience with Hitler. The News and Communications newspaper, Prime Minister MacDonald's mouthpiece, recently published an article entitled "A New Attempt to Resolve the Disarmament Issue," whose methods are of great importance and deserve to be introduced. The report briefly stated: "The disarmament issue is now based on MacDonald's original plan for discussion. MacDonald's original plan contains a chapter on the disarmament monitoring standing committee (i.e., Chapter 5 of the original plan). A clause should be added to this chapter stipulating that the minerals most essential for military action should be listed and monitored. The monitoring method should be based on the current commercial needs of the signatory countries to determine the allocation of such minerals. The method is the same as the provisions of the narcotics convention, which determines the allocation of each country according to the current medical needs of narcotics. As for countries that have not signed the convention, i.e., those who are unwilling to be supervised by the Standing Committee, they will not be able to obtain an allocation according to the proportion of their country's commercial needs, because countries that have not signed the convention cannot guarantee the use of the minerals allocated to them. The implementation of this monitoring system should follow the implementation method of the narcotics convention, establishing a licensed monopoly system in each signatory country to impose restrictions. At the international level, a central monitoring bureau should be established. Each signatory country must regularly submit reports to the bureau on the sale of military minerals. If this is the case, it will not be difficult to understand the abnormal state of current military mineral import and export statistics, and the secret supply of military minerals will be impossible to conceal. In addition, the right of search can be used to prevent smuggling. Fortunately, minerals are not as easy to hide as narcotics, so this monitoring system will be easier to implement than narcotics monitoring. However, this issue has been overlooked by the general public and needs to be reviewed at present." (Note: National newspapers reported last month that the amount of nickel produced in Canada and imported into Germany has doubled in the past year. Nickel is necessary for the manufacture of military supplies, so British newspapers have used this as proof of Germany's secret military expansion. The proposals made by the News and Communications newspaper may have been caused by this.) (10th Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>Central Government and National Government Memorial Week Reports: Liang Han-tsao: Overcoming Current Difficulties; Yu Yu-jen: Status of Yellow River Project</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Government held its 108th Memorial Week at 9 a.m. on the 11th. More than 500 people attended, including Chu Min-yi, Chu Cheng, Chen Li-fu, Li Chi-wen, Miao Pei-cheng, Li Tsung-huang, Hung Lu-tung, Chi Liang, Liang Han-tsao, Xiao Chi-shan, and all staff members. Chu Cheng presided over the meeting. Liang Han-tsao reported, stating that recently a few people and a few newspapers have criticized or questioned whether the Party can overcome the current national crisis. In fact, according to the Party's past successful history and its spirit of organization, unity, and sacrifice, we can conclude that no matter how difficult it is, the Party has the power to overcome it. The Prime Minister once said that what the Party relies on for its revolutionary power is truth, justice, and morality. With these magic weapons, we can not only succeed, but even if we fail, we can deeply win the sympathy of the people. Past experience is a lesson for the future. The Fourth Plenary Session is about to be held. We should revive the soul of the Party and hope that all comrades will have stronger faith in the doctrine and restore the spirit of fraternity among comrades. Then the Party will definitely be able to overcome the current difficulties and move straight towards the great road of nation-building. (11th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

After Chairman Lin led the attendees in paying their respects, Yu Yu-jen reported on the status of the Yellow River flood relief project, stating that he took advantage of his return to Shaanxi to inspect the disaster areas along the Yellow River. The tragic situation was shocking. Therefore, governing the Yellow River is currently an urgent task. According to the report of Mr. Bauer, advisor to the Yellow River Disaster Committee, the funds required for the water conservancy project and the diversion of the Jing River downstream are approximately 80 million yuan. The project can be completed in six years, requiring only more than 10 million yuan each year. The annual losses from the Yellow River floods are unknown, but they amount to tens of millions. If Mr. Bauer's Yellow River management project is successful, this huge loss can be avoided each year. He hopes that people across the country will work hard to make this happen.

<h3>Relief for Northeastern Refugees is Difficult: Funds Have Not Yet Been Allocated; Remarks by Mei Kung-jen of the Preparatory Committee</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Mei Kung-jen, a member of the preparatory committee for the Northeast Refugee Relief Association, said that the relief of Northeastern refugees and the establishment of the committee had been approved by the Executive Yuan, but the 5 million yuan fund has not yet been allocated, and various tasks cannot be carried out. A regular meeting is scheduled for next Thursday to discuss the matter. After the measures are reviewed, the committee will be established under the auspices of the Executive Yuan. The committee is temporarily set to have 34 members, with the heads of various ministries as ex-officio members, and others will be invited to serve as members who are highly respected in the Northeast. If it is necessary to run factories, the Central Government will allocate 100,000 yuan per month as operating expenses. Because the Northeastern disaster victims have not suffered from natural disasters or man-made disasters, it actually contains political implications. If they are not provided with relief, it is tantamount to voluntarily giving up. Once they have no means of living and flee to outside the pass, the impact on the future of the nation will be profound and great. (11th Special Telegram)</p>

<h3>Chairman Jiang Studies Offense, Defense, Pacification = Reprinting Ping Pi Bai Jin Fang, Renamed Self-Defense New Knowledge = = So that Those with Military and Political Responsibilities Know What to Adopt =</h3>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: The book "Ping Pi Bai Jin Fang" by Huilu Jiumin, is an essential work for offense, defense, and pacification. It details plans for governing soldiers and defending territory. Chairman Jiang, amidst his busy military affairs, has reviewed it and believes it is beneficial for military affairs and can be used as a model by those with political responsibilities. However, the book is rarely transmitted, so it was renamed "Self-Defense New Knowledge" and reprinted, with a new preface personally written. It is reported that the book has now been published, bound into two thick volumes. In addition to being distributed to the staff of the General Headquarters and various divisions and brigades for reference, 500 copies were specially distributed to the provincial government yesterday, ordering them to be forwarded to various departments and security groups for rotation and study as a reference and to increase knowledge. The preface personally written by Chairman Jiang and the general catalog of the book are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Jiang's Preface</h3>
<p>Liu Yan once said, "Those who are good at treating diseases do not let them reach the point of danger and exhaustion." Therefore, physicians pay attention to the health of blood and qi. "Ying" is the circulation of "Wei" in the blood vessels, and "Ying" and "Wei" are two but one. If "Wei" is obtained properly, not only will it not lead to danger and exhaustion, but it will also be easy to curb the source of the disease, and offense, supplementation, acupuncture, and moxibustion will all have prepared and worry-free defense techniques. "Wei" will be more consolidated in the invisible. "Ping Pi Bai Jin Fang" compiled by Huilu Jiumin was based on the fact that the generals and officials at that time were generally tired and numb, and the symptoms of the disease had already appeared, and they were also reluctant to use offense, supplementation, acupuncture, and moxibustion. Therefore, it was a plan to revive the dead and prescribe the right medicine, detailing plans for governing soldiers and defending the territory. It is divided into fourteen categories, with treating before illness, treating incipient illness, and treating existing illness as the order, all of which are insights into the prevention and strengthening of the foundation. I have carefully reviewed it amidst the busy military affairs and believe that it deeply reveals the current common diseases of stagnation and occlusion. If the generals and officials who personally bear the war and defense are all punished by the signs of danger and exhaustion, and study it carefully according to its formula, then it may be cured. Considering that the book is rarely transmitted, I immediately ordered it to be printed and published so that those in charge of military and political affairs know what to adopt, which will benefit the future of offense, defense, and pacification. It is renamed "Self-Defense New Knowledge," which still takes the meaning of "Ying" and "Wei" from medical science, with divine changes, following the ancient method without deviating from the current situation. Jiang Zhongzheng, October of the twenty-second year of the Republic of China</p>

<h3>Results of the German New Reichstag Election (European Correspondence) Lieshan</h3>
<p>At 7:00 PM on November 11th, German President General Hindenburg gave a speech that played a rearguard action in this election. It was not without significance that Hitler's party won a majority of votes. Although his speech was brief, it was very powerful. He advised the German people to vote in favor of Hitler with a completely supportive attitude, and in many places, he also provided commentary and proof for Hitler's actions. Hindenburg came from a noble family and enjoyed great prestige in all aspects, especially among the aristocratic military and farmers. The German National People's Party (now dissolved), centered on these people, clearly obeyed Hindenburg. Normally, these people were absolutely opposed to Hitler. If you met a young nobleman and asked him if Hitler was a party member, he would definitely snort disdainfully and then tell you that he was of royal blood and would never become a Hitler party member. Hindenburg's explanation naturally took effect on this group of people, because he also said that this Reichstag election and referendum were related to the entire fate of Germany in the future. By the night of the 11th, everything was obviously extraordinarily tense. The streets were full of pedestrians, but it seemed like something was missing – a solemnity that was almost busy. Although everyone was still walking around, the Nazi Party naturally stepped up its propaganda on the last night. However, the general opinion was that the whole thing had been decided long ago, and there was obviously not much interest in the propaganda. In this election, in addition to the Nazi Party headquarters and the official efforts to promote it, people's organizations also issued declarations and notices from the leaders of various groups. For example, the Catholic Church, the Christian Church, the trade union farmers' group, the cultural group, etc., said mostly the same thing, emphasizing the seriousness of this event. In addition, the opposition party lacked the opportunity for propaganda, and the situation abroad was very isolated. Most people could not distinguish it at this point. Secondly, Wilhelm August, the fourth prince of former Emperor Wilhelm II, is one of the important figures in the Nazi Party. He publicly said in Hamburg that if anyone voted against it, we would definitely find him and treat him as a criminal. This could scare some of the more timid members of the opposition, who naturally did not dare to try it easily. Again, in small cities and villages, the opposition members never dared to move. As a result, the power of the opposition was limited. The total number of German voters was 45,146,277. 42,995,718 participated in the Reichstag election. 43,460,529 participated in the referendum. The Nazi Party received 39,646,273 votes in the Reichstag election. 40,609,243 votes were in favor. 3,349,445 invalid votes. 2,101,004 votes were against. Note: The numbers in this table are based on the official second revised numbers, which are slightly different from the announcement on the first day. 750,282 invalid votes. In the Reichstag election, the Nazi Party won more than 90% of the votes. The approval votes in the referendum were even more. However, this result did not surprise anyone at home or abroad, because it was inevitable. As for why the number of people participating in the referendum was more than in the Reichstag election, it was because many members of the National People's Party and centrists, although they did not agree with Hitler, hated the French even more. Hitler said that the referendum was to deal with France, so they believed it and specially participated in the vote.</p>
<p>Six hundred and sixty members of the new Reichstag were elected. One of the most ridiculed things is that although the method of democratic politics is used to elect, the voters do not know who their vote is for, and most of the members are people who have never been heard of before, except for a very small number of ministers, industrialists, and politicians. Analyzing this group of new members, about fifty of them are current ministers and administrative heads of various provinces and regions, and about forty of them are higher and middle-level officials. There are also about forty workers' representatives, and the number of farmers' representatives is more than that of workers. There are also about forty places for handicraft workers. Representatives of the industrial and commercial circles and capital owners occupy about two hundred seats. Naturally, nine out of ten of the above figures are members of the Nazi Party. The remaining places are the leaders of the Nazi Party's youth stormtroopers, bronze helmet regiments, and various places. The new Reichstag has two characteristics: the number of young people has increased and no female members have participated. Hitler has always discriminated against women, and the advocacy of good wives and mothers over the years has been even more relentless. The exclusion of women from this new Reichstag is a manifestation of his views.</p>
<p>Naturally, the course of this election was as expected by the Nazi Party. Needless to say, the authorities were satisfied and excited. The day after the election, Hitler issued two declarations, one to the people and one to the Nazi Party members. The general meaning was a very proud description of his gratitude because the German people were unanimously under his guidance. On the same day, Isonberg, a famous political commentator of the Nazi Party, wrote an article in the National Observation Newspaper, concluding that (Hitler is Germany). He explained that the huge harvest of this election has been announced to the world, and the German people are completely consistent with his leader Hitler. The attitudes of other newspapers are also similar, congratulating the achievements this time in unison, especially for the external aspects, believing that it has great historical significance. At the same time, Propaganda Minister Goebbels received the most praise from all parties, because everyone attributed it to his effective propaganda. In addition, President Hindenburg congratulated Hitler, and Bappen congratulated Hitler on behalf of all cabinet members. On this day, Hitler's position was in fact no less than that of Mussolini in Italy.</p>
<p>In fact, since the Nazi Party came to power, Hitler has had a very solid position. The Reichstag has already passed the four-year trust case first, and all political parties have been destroyed later. Why bother with this election? Not only do German newspapers refuse to say the reason, but most of the newspapers in other European countries do not describe it clearly. According to various speculations, there are two main reasons: one is that Hitler issued too many promissory notes, and he is at a loss in diplomacy. If he does not withdraw from the League of Nations, problems will arise domestically. If he withdraws from the League of Nations, diplomacy will immediately become serious. Therefore, he took the measures of withdrawing from the League of Nations and holding elections to unify the country, while vigorously using the slogan of peace to cover up concessions to France, so as to reconcile the internal and external atmosphere. Another reason is that the irreconcilable opposition between France and Germany will break out sooner or later. France has recently taken a further step to draw Austria to the other side, so it wants to take the opportunity to fundamentally deal with Hitler, planning to try to get the southern German provinces of Bavaria and Baden to secede from Prussia and merge with Austria to form another German-Austrian Confederation. Therefore, this matter is very possible, because the people in Bavaria and Baden, whether in religion, only a part of the big cities is left. This group of people includes socialists, (a part of Social Democrats, and a part of Communists,) liberals (a part of Central Party members, and members of other small political parties) and some nobles. Although Hitler has unified the parties in form, in fact, the basic masses of the previous parties still seem unable to be influenced. Therefore, Hitler said to the workers, "It is good that some of you still oppose me. I will start educating your children. A few years later, this group of young children will be young members of the National Socialist Party. At that time, they will automatically oppose the views of their parents."</p>
<p>The day of the 12th election finally arrived. In the morning, the military bands of the Hitler Party paraded everywhere. Since Hitler's speech at the Siemens factory in Berlin on the 10th, the national flags and party flags hanging on the windows of all kinds of houses across the country had spent two nights and were still flying on this day. Before 9:00 AM, the polling places were already crowded with people. After 9:00 AM, the election began. The voters were shoulder to shoulder, forming a long snake formation, but everyone was obviously very silent. Each voter had to buy another badge specially made by the government when voting. The text said "In favor," and another line was added, "November 12, 1933." Everyone bought it and hung it on their chests, so no one dared not to spend this money. The price of the badge was set at five cents, but everyone gave at least three times as much. The total number of voters on that day was more than 43 million, which means that the German government's income on this day was almost close to 10 million yuan, which is naturally also a business experience.</p>
<p>The election continued until 6:00 PM before it stopped. Except for a very few people, most of them helped the old and carried the young, vying to be the first. The power of the Nazi Party was deeply recognized by the German people in this election. On this day, no one dared to hum a "no," otherwise it would be cheap to taste the flavor of the iron window alone.</p>
<p>After 7:00 PM on the same day, the results of the elections in various places were reported successively by wireless telephone. Many cafes were full of customers who were listening quietly to the news, and the business was naturally a hundred times better. It was not completed until 1:00 AM. The results of this Reichstag election and referendum are as follows: ·Historically·Habitually·Austria is closer to Austria than to Prussia, (Note) Most of the people in Southern Germany and Austria believe in Catholicism, while the people of Prussia believe in Christianity. Especially recently, Hitler's actions to support Christianity often conflict with Catholicism. France can take the opportunity to proceed, splitting Germany and fundamentally weakening Hitler's power. Therefore, people say that the German government's referendum method is a response to France's plan. As a result, the last sentence of President Hindenburg's speech was shouting, "The German people unite." Naturally, this drama is also starting. Hitler is taking strong centralized measures in an attempt to preemptively strike. However, in general, there are more components that are unfavorable to Hitler, because France will ultimately not hesitate to use military force to resolve the issue. Otherwise, unless Hitler surrenders to satisfy him. After the new election, the public opinion of various countries will of course attack and satirize it as usual. French Foreign Minister Boncour even sang a hardline tune. Britain re-introduced the Disarmament Conference, hoping that Germany would submit. Where will Germany's future go? No one dares to predict it on this day, but the air among the German people obviously has deep worries, fearing that the French army will visit the Rhine area again in the future. Europe in 1935 will probably not be peaceful again.</p>
<p>Observing from the position of Chinese people, Hitler's views are another matter, and we can leave them aside for the time being. But his spirit of seeking liberation for the nation and his courage to do it to the death are enough for us to admire. (Late night on the 14th. Europe)</p>
<h3>Weihaiwei: A Record of Sino-British Joint Celebration</h3>
<p>Weihaiwei Correspondence: It has been three years since Weihaiwei was returned by Britain. Foreigners pay close attention to the construction of various administrations in our country after the recovery. Commissioner Xu Zushan has been able to work hard during these three years, maintaining law and order, and winning the goodwill of foreign public opinion, which is not easy. The Chinese people are eager to recover national rights, and this matter is worthy of attention, so it is specially recorded as follows:</p>
<p>British Consul Morse, stationed in Weihaiwei, hosted a banquet at the Donghai Hotel at 12:00 noon on November 28th to welcome Commissioner Xu of the Administrative Office back to Weihai from Nanjing last week. He had previously asked more than 30 people, including British naval officers and leaders of local agencies, as well as Chinese and British business people, to accompany him. On that day, the guests and hosts arrived, and the British Consul received them. During the banquet, the British Consul raised his glass and stood up to report to the public that Commissioner Xu had gone to Pingjin and Nanjing for official business a few days ago, and had returned to Weihai after completing his work. I have prepared some simple dishes to welcome Commissioner Xu back and invite all the guests to enjoy the day. The British businessmen here believe that Commissioner Xu has been in Weihai for three years, and he has done his best to carry out everything that should be done in the local area, especially the good local law and order, which allows Chinese and foreign merchants to live and work in peace, which is worthy of our gratitude. Although the situation in Weihai is not prosperous, but according to my observation, if Commissioner Xu is given a long time to reorganize it, it will definitely prosper, which is no doubt. Now I raise a glass of wine to wish Commissioner Xu good health). Then Commissioner Xu stood up to answer, saying briefly, (I just heard what Consul Morse said, and I am very ashamed of his praise. In the past few years, even if there were one or two constructions, they were also things that should be done in the line of duty. Last year, the national economy was in decline, which affected Weihai. I have the responsibility to prosper the city and protect the local area, and I should naturally work hard to seek the development of commerce. What makes me most happy during these three years is the very harmonious Sino-British friendship. The reason why it can be so is mostly due to the work of Consul Morse, because Consul Morse knows the situation in Weihai well, and he cooperates sincerely in everything, so that Sino-British naval friendship and Chinese and foreign people have no barriers here, which I admire very much. I am very grateful for the invitation today, and I wish all of you here good health). So the wine glasses were exchanged, and the guests and hosts were very happy, which was very grand for a time.

<h3>Economic and Transportation Panic in Fujian Province = Tight Silver Supply in the Market = = Rising Food Prices, Sources Cut Off = = All Steamship Navigation Suspended =</h3>
<p>The Economic Committee invited various chambers of commerce to discuss how to save the fast shipping routes of Fuzhou. After the so-called People's Government was established in this province, it was widely rumored that it was colluding with the Communist Party, implementing socialism, dividing the land, and confiscating capital, which caused extreme anxiety among the people. Most farmers sold their stored grain, and merchants did not dare to handle large quantities of goods. For this reason, the authorities issued a notice the day before yesterday, stating that they absolutely respected private inherent rights, protected industrial and commercial capital, and established an Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee to attract overseas Chinese businessmen to return to the country to invest and start businesses. However, the people still dared not believe it, and suspicions arose repeatedly. Money houses all reduced their business scope, withdrew banknotes, and stopped lending money, resulting in a very tight silver supply. The silk and cloth gangs refused to return the period accounts of the hongs because they could not withdraw money (that is, borrow money from money houses). The largest Hexing Rice Store in the city also went bankrupt for more than 90,000 yuan due to poor turnover the day before yesterday. Most of the grain in this province relies on foreign rice transported from Shanghai and Hong Kong. Recently, due to the suspension of Chinese merchant steamships in Shanghai, the source has been greatly affected. Although it is now the time of the autumn harvest, the price of each stone of rice transported into the city from various villages and sold is still maintained at around nine yuan, but after this, rice prices will gradually rise, which is in the minds of the people. For this reason, the Economic Committee specially summoned representatives from the chambers of commerce of important places such as Fuzhou, Xiamen, Quanzhou, Zhangzhou, Longyan, Putian, Sandu, Yanping, Yangkou, etc. to the province, and scheduled a meeting to be held from the 13th to discuss the two issues of maintaining finance and regulating food, and to request the authorities to allow the free export of tea, wood, paper, bamboo shoots, and other products in the province to revitalize foreign trade. As for the transportation problem, which is closely related to commerce, in addition to the complete suspension of Chinese merchant steamships between Shanghai and Fuzhou, the small steamships operating inland from Fuzhou to Sandu Shacheng in eastern Fujian and Quanzhou Hanjiang in southern Fujian have also been completely suspended due to fear of detention by the navy and opposition to the collection of ship taxes. It is estimated that Zhenbo and Shunchuan steamships were detained by the navy in Sandu. Hai Zou and Yujiang steamships were detained in Shacheng. Gongning, Anhai, Ningan, Fuxing, Jiangmen, Jiankang, Gongyi, Huazhou, Fuxing, Chuanping, Tongji, Tonghe, Chuanli, and Doulie, fourteen ships, were moored in Fuzhou. Tongli was moored in Quanzhou. Inland transportation has been completely suspended, and the local area is extremely panicked. (December 8th)</p>
<h3>Ganzhou: Large-Scale Arrest of Reactionaries</h3>
<p>Jiujiang Correspondence: Nanchang is the military center for suppressing the Red Army and rebels. Since the Fujian Rebellion occurred, the authorities are deeply afraid that there are reactionaries lurking in it, secretly communicating news, and disrupting the rear. The inspection and prevention are extremely strict. Recently, the authorities believe that the AB group of the past is now colluding with the Social Democratic Party and the Nationalist Party, and it is inevitable that it will spread over time and cause disaster in the future. At the same time, a certain party discovered that the members of the group were secretly communicating with someone and plotting to expand. Therefore, the authorities issued a secret order to arrest them. At about 10:00 PM on the 4th of this month, various plainclothes detectives went to arrest them separately. It is estimated that most of the people arrested in the province were from the education sector, and there were also some in the party department. The main members fled far away after hearing the news in advance. After each person was arrested, there were many rumors in society, and the truth was unknown. It is said that the authorities are only preventing these people, and it is not as serious as the rumors outside. The arrested people were allowed to meet with their families and friends yesterday. It is also heard that as long as someone guarantees that they are not members of the AB group or the Social Democratic Party, and that they will not engage in secret small-group activities in the future, they can be released.

<h3>Eastern Hubei: Wu's Bandits Flee to the Border of Anhui = Huge Losses in Eastern Hubei and Southern Henan = = Liu Zhenhua Will Be Stationed in Lu'an to Supervise the Suppression =</h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The remnants of the bandits in the border area of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, the pseudo-25th and 28th Armies, were led by the bandit leader Wu Huanxian and fled to the Huangma area of Eastern Hubei, using the Ziyun area as their base. After being suppressed and defeated by the 13th Division of Wan Yaohuang, they fled to Shangcheng and Gushi in Southern Henan and occupied Xuanhua Store. It was recovered by Xiao Zhichu, the director of the 44th Division, and Li Heng, the regiment attached to Xiao's division, was killed in action in this battle. The bandits suffered even greater losses. The bandits knew that the Eastern Hubei and Southern Henan were gathering large armies and it was difficult to gain a foothold. They decided to flee to Western Anhui and Northern Anhui in order to survive. At this time, Liu Zhenhua had already proposed to set up a headquarters in Lu'an, ordering the nearby garrison troops to build a highway from Lu'an to Huangchuan to facilitate transportation. The bandits feared that if the road was completed, it would be convenient to transport troops and they would be threatened in the future. They urgently concentrated in Tangji and Wulongji on the border of Henan and Anhui, with a total of more than 6,000 people and more than 3,000 guns, attempting to disturb the Huanglu'an Road. Liu Zhenhua, upon receiving the report, ordered Liu Maoen of the 65th Division and Dai Minquan of the 45th Division to jointly suppress them. Tan, the brigade of Dai's division, learned that the bandits were moving from Changjianghe toward Liji, Wumiao, and Qingfengling, which was indeed a sign of disturbing the road. He immediately deployed defenses to meet and suppress them. At the same time, he notified Ruan, the brigade of Liu's division, by telephone to open Lu'an to the east for defense. Tan's brigade waited for work in Wumiao and Dachapu and defeated the bandits. However, the bandits gathered a large force again and desperately attacked Huangtuling and Qingfengling via Suxianshi and Zaoxuehe, but they were still unsuccessful. They fled back to Changjianghe and Linshiji and fled to Zhouji in Huoqiu. Dai's division has now advanced to the line of Wangpengzi, Yanchao Ferry, Linshiji, and Hejian, and has made contact with Liu's division. It has been decided to take advantage of the bandit's defeat and launch a general attack on Zhouji from two directions. Liu Zhenhua also decided to move his headquarters to Lu'an to supervise the suppression in order to wipe out the remnants of the bandits completely entering Anhui. (9th)</p>
<h3>Liu Zhenhua Inspects Wuhu</h3>
<p>- Also Attending Citizens' Anti-Rebellion Rally - Wuhu Correspondence: Since becoming Chairman of Anhui, Liu Zhenhua has been preoccupied with bandit suppression and has not resided in Anhui for long. He returned to Anqing about ten days ago to organize various administrative affairs. Recently, considering Wuhu to be the leading district of Anhui and a crucial point on the Yangtze River, he took the Anfeng warship to Wuhu for inspection at 10 p.m. on the 9th, accompanied by Provincial Government Commissioner Li Yunqi, Provincial Party Committee member Zhang Xinnan, Secretaries Chen Yi and He Kan. Arriving at the port at 8 a.m. this morning (the 10th), representatives from various police and civil organizations welcomed him at the riverbank. After landing, Liu first inspected the Public Security Bureau, then proceeded to the Second District Administrative Commissioner's Office, where he assembled all members of the security team and police officers for instruction. He hoped they would live up to their names and fulfill their duties. He then met with representatives from the business and labor communities, and told reporters: (Regarding the banditry in the border areas of the three provinces, Hubei and Henan have been completely cleared. A few scattered bandits in western Anhui are being searched and eliminated. The headquarters remains in Huangchuan, and a forward command has been established in Liu'an to facilitate command. On the administrative front, I only know how to bury myself in work and am unwilling to engage in empty talk. Regarding the Fujian Incident, the central government has made ample preparations, and its internal situation is complex, so we don't need to pay much attention to it, as its demise is imminent. This trip is specifically for inspecting the military, administrative, commercial, and rural conditions in Wuhu. I must return to the province today to attend the Monday memorial week, etc.).</p>
<p>Liu inquired in detail about the social conditions at all levels in Wuhu, and the commissioner's office was assigned to investigate and provide item-by-item reports. The main points were: (1) Public security and education implementation: In addition to the three county-administered security platoons, security outposts are set up in Wanchun Township and Fangcun in the countryside. (2) Baojia (community policing) status: The county already has more than 100 Baojia offices. (3) Rural economic conditions and reasons for decline: Low grain prices hurt farmers, and there are too many tenant farmers. (4) Anti-smoking situation: The Second District Commissioner's Office and the Public Security Bureau have ordered the establishment of an anti-smoking section between towns and villages to strictly prohibit smoking. (5) Commercial situation and trade volume: Wuhu's commerce revolves around the rice market. Recently, the rice market has been weak, and there has been no commercial development. The trade volume is naturally based on rice exports, with other products accounting for a very small number. (6) Promotion of rural cooperative societies and farmer loan offices: More than 100 rural cooperative societies have been established in the countryside, and loan offices are convening board meetings to prepare for opening. (7) Strengths and weaknesses of local gentry: The gentry in the city and countryside are generally law-abiding.</p>
<p>All sectors of Wuhu held a citizens' rally to denounce the Fujian rebellion at the Song and Dance Theater at 1 p.m. today (the 10th). Upon hearing the news, Liu also attended. About 1,000 people attended, presided over by Wang Yibaozhai, the administrative supervisor of the Second District. After the chairman announced the significance of the meeting, Liu delivered a speech, stating that the 19th Route Army was a meritorious force in fighting the Communists and resisting Japan. However, the Communist bandits and the violent Japanese were hated by all the people, but now they are being used by a few traitors such as Chen Mingshu to act perversely, collude with the Communists, and unite with Japan, truly making them public enemies of the entire nation. He then elaborated on the suffering of the people in the Red areas and the Communist policies, which are completely unsuitable for the needs of the people in our country. Therefore, the red puppet government in Fujian will never be able to exist. The significance of today's citizens' anti-rebellion rally is very important, etc. Afterwards, the meeting passed four proposals: (1) Telegraph the central government and the National Government to issue a clear order to suppress the Fujian rebellion; (2) Send a telegram to all provinces and cities across the country to jointly denounce the Fujian rebels; (3) Telegraph the Central Committee members residing in various places to quickly go to Beijing to attend the Fourth Plenary Session and jointly formulate national policies; (4) Telegraph Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek to succeed in suppressing the bandits and ask him to divide his troops to suppress Fujian. Finally, the meeting ended with slogans. After the meeting, Liu took the original warship back to the province. It is said that when Liu arrived at the port, he telegraphed Mao Longzhang, the Director of the Anhui Finance Department in Beijing, to rush to Wuhu by car to discuss financial issues, and it was rumored that he would allocate 300,000 yuan borrowed in Wuhu to meet urgent needs. Therefore, although Liu went to the province, Mao remained in Wuhu (the 10th).</p>
<h3>Luo Wen'gan Inspects the Jiangsu Provincial Judiciary</h3>
<p>Suzhou Correspondence: Luo Wen'gan, Minister of Judicial Administration, accompanied by Liu, the Third Section Chief of the Ministry, and two bodyguards, arrived in Suzhou yesterday morning (the 11th) via the Jingzha (Beijing-Zhabei) train to inspect various judicial matters, as follows:</p>
<h3>Welcoming Personnel</h3>
<p>Minister Luo arrived in Suzhou at 12:40 p.m. Upon receiving a telegram from Hengde, those who went to the station to welcome him included: President of the High Court Lin Biao, Chief Prosecutor of the High Court Hu Yigu, President of the District Court Wang Simo, Chief Prosecutor Xu Shixun, Director of the Reformatory Liu Yun, and several dozen other section chiefs and judges of the High Court and District Court. After Luo got off the train, he went to Room 15 of the Railway Hotel for a short rest, and then was accompanied by President Lin and others to the Yanqing Building for lunch.</p>
<h3>Inspecting the High Court</h3>
<p>At 2 p.m., President Lin and others hired streetcars and accompanied Luo to the High Court for inspection. First, they inspected all the offices, and then they toured the civil and criminal courts. At that time, the Third Criminal Court was hearing an appeal case of rape from Tongshan. Luo stopped by and listened quietly.</p>
<h3>Luo's Remarks</h3>
<p>According to Luo's words to reporters, he had previously sent Shen Jiayi, President of the Shanghai Special District Court, and others to Suzhou first. This time, my stay in Suzhou will depend on the completion of the inspection. Given the complexity of the facilities such as the Suzhou prisons, I will probably need to stay for one or two days. He also said that after Suzhou, he will continue to inspect various judicial counties along the Jinghu (Beijing-Shanghai) line. Yesterday, Luo wore a small melon-shaped hat, a blue silk cotton robe, and a woolen cloak, looking exceptionally energetic. He later went to the Third Branch of the Supervision Office and scheduled to inspect the District Court and other prisons on the 12th.</p>
<h3>The Yellow River Embankment Along the Shandong Province Has Been Completely Renovated</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The River Affairs Bureau previously reported that this autumn and summer, the water level rose very high, breaking historical records. Through the efforts of officials and the people, the embankment was protected from breaching. After the major flood, the river was peaceful and the banks were secure, so the most severely damaged dikes along the South Fourth and North Third sections of the river were repaired in preparation for the spring flood. The project has now been completed. Liang Jinming, the Third Chief Section Chief of the River Affairs Bureau, was dispatched to inspect and accept the project. The provincial government was also invited to send personnel for inspection. The River Affairs Bureau will soon send personnel to all sections of the river to inspect the internal affairs of the officers and soldiers and prepare for the spring flood control project next year. In addition, the project of blocking the Xiaopangzhuang breach, which was jointly undertaken by the River Affairs Bureau and the Yellow River Disaster Relief Committee engineers, is expected to be completed between the 10th and the 15th. In addition to the 50,000 yuan remitted by the Gongzhen Group of the Relief Committee, there is still a balance of 10,500 yuan, which was also remitted by the Central Bank today for payment to workers. (8th)</p>
<h3>Songjiang: Continued Success in Apprehending Major Bandits</h3>
<p>In the case of robbery and assault at the home of Wu Youlan in Zhujiahang, Punan, Yang Shijie, the detective captain of the county's Public Security Bureau, led detectives to Shanghai the day before yesterday and arrested four notorious bandits, including Xia Dasan Mazi. After preliminary interrogation, they confessed that the stolen boat and firearms were hidden in Pinghu and Jiashan in Zhejiang Province. According to the confession, Director Shen ordered the department to prepare a document and dispatch Inspector Chen Shuliang and Detective Captain Yang Shijie to lead detectives Wei Yunhui, Xia Shengyu, Ye Abing, and Qian Yiqing to Pinghu. They submitted a document to the Public Security Bureau and requested the dispatch of police to investigate. They apprehended major bandits Xia San Xiao Mazi, Zhou San, and three family members of the notoriously fierce bandit Xia Kaiqing's wife. On the spot, they seized one Mauser pistol and one handgun, as well as two stolen boats and a large amount of clothing. Except for the bandit women, who were taken back first, the remaining bandits and stolen goods were temporarily deposited at the Pinghu Public Security Bureau. Chen and others set off that night, and also recovered one rifle and 56 bullets at the Chaonitan location in Jiashan County. They escorted them back to Songjiang at dusk on the 11th, and they were detained at the Public Security Bureau for verification. According to a telegram from Pinghu County Public Security Bureau, the bandits Xia San Xiao Mazi, Zhou San, and the stolen boats and firearms detained at the Pinghu County Public Security Bureau will be escorted to Songjiang on the 12th, and they will be picked up at the Mizidu Pier in Huangpu Beach. It is said that robbery cases have occurred frequently in various parts of the county, and most of them were committed by this gang of bandits. The arrest of these major villains is truly eliminating harm for the local area.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Requesting Protection for Waterway Security</h3>
<p>Every winter, the local shipping industry allocates boats from the Sixth Brigade of the Second Water Police District to be stationed for all waterway defense matters, and designates police officers to escort them on a daily basis in the south at Shendu and Wangting, and in the north at Baitangwei. The period lasts from the end of winter to the spring flood season, about five months. Waterway safety depends on this maintenance. This year, the water police were ordered to reduce their size, and although Xiyi (Wuxi) still has a detachment stationed there, it has actually been deployed to Majishan to take on defense duties. The shipping industry has lost this guarantee and is deeply worried. Yesterday, they specifically sent a letter to the Municipal Management Committee to forward it to the County Government, requesting that it follow past precedents and order the County Water Patrol Team to dispatch patrol boats to be stationed at key locations in the four townships in the near future to ensure the safety of travelers and maintain security.</p>
<h3>Undecided Dispute Over Mixed Sales of Counterfeit Medicines</h3>
<p>Li Tongfeng Pharmacy at the entrance of Shuyuan Lane in the city offered price reductions last month. Chen Yingen, a person from Dangko, bought two yuan worth of Western ginseng from the pharmacy. After it was tested, it was found to be counterfeit. Since medicines are related to the lives of patients, how can fake goods be used to deceive? He immediately negotiated with the pharmacy and had a conflict with his partner Li Hanxian. He then filed a criminal lawsuit against the pharmacy with the County Court on charges of obtaining money by fraud, etc. The Pharmaceutical Industry Association also stated that Li Tongfeng should not sell improper Western ginseng, which would hinder the reputation of the pharmaceutical industry, and issued a statement in the newspaper. Yesterday, Zou Shengxun also submitted a petition to the County Government, stating that Li Tongfeng sold inferior goods and harmed people's lives, requesting that it be ordered to be shut down to emphasize the importance of people's lives.</p>
<h3>Changzhou: Embezzlement of Large Sums by Power Plant Employees</h3>
<p>Lu Fengxiang, an employee of the Qishuyan Gas Plant, has been specializing in coal duties for many years. However, he harbored bad intentions and embezzled more than 27,000 yuan in foreign currency for coal from the 19th year of the Republic to this year. Recently, the resident Wuxi office of the plant learned about it because of an uneven distribution of spoils among his accomplices. After investigating various coal yards, it was found to be true, and the Construction Committee was reported. The committee has ordered that Lu Fengxiang be suspended from his duties first, and the situation of his embezzlement will be investigated and handled further.</p>
<h3>Changshu: Robbery and Assault in Luojia Bang</h3>
<p>In Luojia Bang, the 14th District of this county, there is a business owner named Shi Wang, who is quite wealthy and also a widow, so there are very few men in her family. This has made her the target of bandits. On the night of the 9th of this month, more than 30 bandits suddenly came to Shi Wang's house to rob her. At that time, each bandit had only one rifle, and most of the others had wooden sticks, knives, and axes. They went to the town first and robbed two old guns from the security regiment, then climbed onto the roof and jumped in. They immediately tied up Shi Wang and Grandma Chen and poured cold water into their mouths and noses to force them to reveal where the silver was hidden. As a result, they robbed them of two taels of gold, as well as clothes and sundries worth about 700 to 800 yuan. The brothers of Ding Gongwei, who lived next door, were also robbed of 300 to 400 yuan. Grandma Chen's left arm was cut by the bandits and she went to Suzhou for treatment on the 11th, and her life is in great danger.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang: Construction Department Plans to Build the Qingzhen Highway</h3>
<p>Shen Baixian, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Construction Department, believes that the only way to maintain transportation between Qingjiang and Zhenjiang is by small inland river boats. After winter, the water becomes shallow and dries up. The sections south of Gaoyou are still passable, but the silted sections around Mapengwan north of Gaoyou are blocked and impassable, so transportation is on the verge of collapse. At a time when the rural economy in northern Jiangsu is bankrupt and production is backward, in order to restore the rural economy in northern Jiangsu, it has been decided to start with construction, especially by first rectifying the transportation. Therefore, a plan has been drawn up to build a highway between Qingjiang and Zhenjiang, and labor will be recruited to build it in order to facilitate the passage of automobiles. In addition to ordering the county chiefs along the canal to be responsible for recruiting labor to actively complete the construction, Chen Zhaoyuan, Commander-in-Chief of the First Army, was also telegraphed to assist in the project. Chen Zhaoyuan also believes that the Qingjiang-Zhenjiang highway is a major construction project in northern Jiangsu, and it is also of great importance in terms of transportation, so he is also strongly promoting its completion. He specifically dispatched Zhao Shijie, Chief of the Ordnance Section of the General Headquarters, to conduct a survey of the route along Jiangdu, Gaoyou, Baoying, Huaian, and Huaiyin counties with Yu Shufang, a committee member dispatched by the Construction Department. Yesterday, the survey had reached Gaoyou. After the survey, a construction method will also be drawn up so that labor can be recruited and construction can begin, and the completion of the Qingjiang-Zhenjiang highway will be completed within a month, allowing automobiles to pass. Once this road is completed, one can travel from Qingjiang to Zhenjiang and Shanghai in one day, making transportation very convenient.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou: The Riverbank of Jiaxing Bridge Collapses</h3>
<p>Jiaxing Bridge, which belongs to the southern township of this county, is located on the banks of the Yangtze River. Due to the erosion of water waves, the riverbank often collapses. Yesterday morning (the 9th), the wharf of the Pujin ferry boat collapsed again. Fortunately, it was during the day, and no one was injured. However, when the boat sailed from Yi to Jia, it could not reach the shore because the pier had collapsed and sailed straight to Zhenbu.</p>
<h3>Nantong: The Gun Robbery Case Has Been Solved</h3>
<p>The guns of the Chenqiao Township Security Regiment were robbed by bandits. The county government strictly ordered the Liuqiao District Regiment Department to pursue and arrest the bandits. It has now searched the bandit den, captured the main bandits Gu Kui, Wei Hai, and Gu Sheng, and recovered the lost guns. The bandits were handed over to the county government and confessed without dispute. County Chief Cheng telegraphed the province for instructions on punishment.</p>
<h3>Change of Public Security Bureau Director</h3>
<p>Chen Yizhong, Director of the Nantong County Public Security Bureau, has resigned. The Department of Civil Affairs has appointed Fu Qianzhi to replace him. Fu is scheduled to take office on the 12th.</p>
<h3>Huzhou: The New President Arrives in Huzhou to Take Office</h3>
<p>Zheng Shikang, the President of the Wuxing Local Branch Court, has been transferred by order. Tu Jingxin was appointed to fill the vacancy. After receiving the order, Zheng immediately proceeded to handle the handover. At about 8 a.m. yesterday, the new President Tu Jingxin arrived at the court to take office.</p>
<h3>Jiashan: Bandits Rob and Commit Arson</h3>
<p>The home of Shen Axiao in Donglugang, north of Xitang Town in this county, was visited by dozens of bandits with accents from Wenzhou and Taizhou the night before last, who looted the entire Donglugang village. After searching for several hours, they could not find anything of value. In a fit of anger, they set fire to the houses of Shen Axiao and a neighbor surnamed Mou in the village. For a time, flames soared in all directions, which were deafening. The bandits, seeing the flames from afar, jumped and cheered, letting it burn before leaving northward with howls.</p>

<h3>Local News: The Marconi Couple Returned Home This Morning = Visited the Zhenru International Radio Station Yesterday Morning = Attended a Dinner Hosted by the Italian Envoy at Noon and a Dinner Hosted by the Pacific Association in the Evening = Boarded the Italian Ship Conte Rosso This Morning to Return to Italy =</h3>
<p>Wireless telegraphy inventor Mr. and Mrs. Marconi's visit to Shanghai was warmly welcomed by political and academic circles, and the Italian political and business circles in Shanghai also gave their sincere hospitality. Yesterday, Mr. Marconi accepted the invitation of the International Telecommunications Bureau and visited the International Radio Station in Zhenru in the morning. In recent years, he attended a banquet at the Italian public envoy's banquet, and in the evening, he attended a banquet at the Pan-Pacific Association. That night, he boarded the Italian ship Conte Rosso to return to his country. The details of the situation are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Visiting the Radio Station</h3>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Marconi's visit to Shanghai, the International Telecommunications Bureau, had already been ordered by the Ministry of Communications to give a sincere hospitality and asked to visit the International Radio Station. Director Wen Yuqing of the Bureau sent a letter of invitation a few days ago, but only because Mr. Marconi felt unwell after arriving in Shanghai, so he sent a letter of refusal to rest at the hotel. Yesterday, Mr. Marconi's health recovered, so he and his wife and the Italian public envoy Boskley, accompanied by Wen Yuqing, Director of the International Telecommunications Bureau, and Yan Renguang, Director of the Department of Telecommunications of the Ministry of Communications, took a car at about 11 o'clock to Zhenru to visit the International Radio Station. Wireless telegraphy machines are currently being installed there, and the machines are all produced by the Marconi Company, so Mr. Marconi was very pleased with them. However, because there was a banquet at the Italian envoy's banquet at noon, he inspected for a week and then took a group photo before returning to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Mr. and Mrs. Marconi visited the International Radio Station (Photographed by the Yingming Photo Studio). Farewell Tea Party</h3>
<p>Yesterday at noon, the Italian envoy Boskley held a banquet to welcome Mr. Marconi. Many diplomatic personnel from various countries attended, and the event was very grand. At 6 p.m., J.S. Srichards, General Manager of Marconi Company, respectfully invited Mr. and Mrs. Marconi to a tea party on the 8th floor of the Cathay Hotel. The guests who came included the Italian envoy and his wife, the consul and his wife, Director Yan and his wife, Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, Fang Ziwei and his wife, Xu Jun, the manager of Siemens Foreign Company, Xu Xueyu, Qiu Jun, the manager of Apro-Asian Victory Company, Ding Zuocheng, Cao Zhongyuan, Yu Ruxin, and the company's engineers Mellon Gouldwg and Hunter, etc. Mr. and Mrs. Marconi said goodbye at about 7 o'clock, and the guests did not leave until 8 o'clock.</p>
<h3>Joint Farewell Party</h3>
<p>The Pacific Association held a banquet at the Lyceum Hotel to bid farewell to Mr. Marconi. At 8:15, Mr. and Mrs. Marconi and the Italian envoy and his wife arrived. Chairman Kong Xiangxi gave a warm welcome. The guests who came included Wang Zhengting, the Italian Consul General and his wife, the advisor Ravana and his wife, and Miss La, the Italian naval commander, Pastor Walsh and his wife, Li Zhaohuan, Xu Peihuang and his wife, Fang Ziwei and his wife, Zhao Jinqing, Yu Qiaqing, He De Kui, Xu Jianping and his wife, Wen Yuqing, Yan Fuzhi, Yan Renguang, and the presidents of the British and American Chambers of Commerce, etc., with a total of more than 300 foreign guests. At 8:30, they entered the banquet hall one after another, the music was played, and the sounds of the banquet were broadcast by radio using microphones and sound amplification devices pre-set by Marconi Company. At the same time, Miss Zhu played two piano pieces, and everyone applauded. At about 9 o'clock, the meal was over.</p>
<h3>Chairman's Speech</h3>
<p>Chairman Kong Xiangxi stood up and gave a speech. He first explained the meaning of the welcome in English, and then gave a welcome speech in Mandarin, saying that the association was honored to welcome the scientific celebrity Mr. and Mrs. Marconi today, and at the same time welcome the new Italian envoy and his wife to China. He then said that wireless telegraphy is the supreme tool of transportation, and Mr. Marconi's great achievements are admirable. I have been to Italy in Europe before and have been well received by the Mo family. Tonight, I would like to express my gratitude to the Italian ambassador. Ambassador Bao is a famous Italian diplomat. At tonight's event, I wish that the friendship between China and Italy will become increasingly close. He then translated the English speech himself and introduced the former Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting to give a welcome speech. (Wang Zhengting's speech) Mr. Wang stood up and said briefly that the meeting tonight was of great significance. As the Italian ambassador first came to China, the scientific celebrity Marconi came to our country. Marconi's invention of wireless telegraphy has made outstanding contributions and benefited mankind, surpassing all other undertakings. Human understanding relies on transportation, and spiritual transportation is important. Wireless telegraphy can communicate spiritual transportation, so that we can know each other more, avoid disputes, and eliminate wars invisibly. In the future, the world will be the same, and it will rely on it. I hope that all civilized countries in the world can make good use of it and not use wireless telegraphy as a tool for mutual attack and adultery. Human beings will be blessed by it, not only Mr. Marconi will be happy about it. In ancient times, the Italian Marco Polo came to China with a festival, which is very memorable. Today, the Italian envoy and Marconi's visit to China is welcomed by the association with the intention of connecting international emotions. I expect that the close relationship between China and Italy will increase with the times. Everyone applauded.</p>
<h3>Italian Envoy's Response</h3>
<p>Then, the Italian envoy Boskley stood up and explained his thanks in English, saying that he did not know Chinese and had to speak in his own language. He said that he was very honored to be with the Bion Association. Wireless telephone communication strengthens international friendship, as the chairman and Dr. Wang said. Mr. Marconi is an Italian, and I would like to thank you on behalf of my country for your sincere hospitality. I also hope that you will teach me as I come to your country as an envoy. Then, the chairman asked everyone to stand up and invite Mr. Marconi to give a speech on wireless telegraphy.</p>
<h3>Marconi's Response</h3>
<p>Mr. Marconi stood up and gave a speech in English, saying that he was not good at speaking your country's language, and your country's language and voice are very pleasant. I plan to use English to say a few words to you. As for speaking about wireless telegraphy, one is that the time is too short, and the other is that I have a slight cold and cannot fulfill my wish. I can only tell you that this time, my wife and I came to your country and were welcomed by people everywhere, and I am very grateful. Especially the chairman and everyone's promotion of me is really not something I dare to accept. Your country is large and populous, and wireless telegraphy is very useful. I hope that people in your country will understand this and connect the people to exchange emotions, which can create a strong and unparalleled country. I have come here for a very short time, and I have only been to a small part of your country. People in your country are kind and friendly, and I have great admiration for your country. I deeply hope that I will have the opportunity to rebuild your country and know more about it in the future. This time, I met a few of your country's wireless telegraphy engineers, all of whom are old friends I have had in Europe and the United States. Their learning is profound and admirable. This morning, I went to visit your country's international radio station, which is under construction nearby, and met European experts who praised the intelligence and talent of Chinese engineers, which is unparalleled. I deeply admire this, and from this, I know that the scientific development of your country in the future is limitless. Everyone applauded.</p>
<h3>Cherished Farewell</h3>
<p>Finally, the chairman raised a glass to Mr. Marconi and said, "Mr. Marconi's speech tonight was really short. We should not force him. I think in a few days we can hear Mr. Marconi's great theories from Rome on the radio again." The meeting ended at ten o'clock, and the guests and hosts parted happily.</p>
<h3>Boarded the Ship Last Night</h3>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Marconi decided to take the Italian ship Conte Rosso to leave Shanghai and return to Italy when they came to Shanghai. The ship set sail at 3:30 this morning, so Mr. and Mrs. Marconi and their secretary Vimalconi boarded the ship at the Bund pier at about 1:00 this morning. The Italian envoy Boskley and the consul Nylon also came to the port to see them off.</p>
<h3>Kong Doesn't Have Negative Intentions</h3>
<p>Met with Zou Lin and others to go to Beijing last night. Yesterday, it was suddenly reported in this port that Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, had resigned. The reporter went to Kong's residence on Xiai Xian Road to inquire about the truth. After some responsible talks by those around him, it was said that the resignation of Minister Kong was absolutely untrue. Minister Kong has always had a long-term spirit and is willing to take responsibility. Otherwise, he would not have taken office resolutely when the country was in serious trouble and the finances were exhausted, knowing that the responsibility of the department was the most difficult. Moreover, he has been engaged in the revolution for decades. Judging from his own personality and the historical facts of his past work for the party and the country, he would not resign. Moreover, after taking office for more than a month, the planning of finances is going smoothly and there are no difficult issues. There is even less intention to resign. It is a pity that some people who are scheming to speculate in business, only for their own personal interests, manipulate the market, and even create such rumors to shake people's hearts, directly regarding the overall situation of the country as child's play.</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu's Speech: Kong Xiangxi's Theory of Being Passive Is Not Accurate. The Two Armies on the Zhejiang Border Have Not Yet Made Contact.</h3>
<p>The Central Committee members remaining in Shanghai will enter Beijing on schedule. Xinxin News Agency said that Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng met with reporters from Xinxin News Agency at the Municipal Government at about 10:00 yesterday morning. It is said that Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi's theory of being inactive is absolutely inaccurate. The details of his speech are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Kong's Theory of Being Passive Is Absolutely Inaccurate</h3>
<p>Yesterday, it was rumored in the port that Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, had a passive attitude due to financial difficulties and inability to cope with the situation. The reporter first asked Mr. Wu about this statement. According to the reply, this is absolutely inaccurate. Although there are financial difficulties at the moment, it is by no means impossible to cope with them. Moreover, Finance Minister Kong is currently planning finances and is working extremely hard.</p>
<h3>Wang's Visit Here Has No Mission</h3>
<p>Mr. Wu also said that President Wang's visit to Shanghai the day before yesterday had no mission. It was only to delay medical treatment and examine diabetes and blood pressure, and to meet with the Central Committee members in Shanghai. The day before yesterday afternoon, I went to Chu Minyi's residence to meet Mr. Wang and had a brief discussion.</p>
<h3>Contact on the Zhejiang Border Is Not So Fast</h3>
<p>The reporter then asked about the news obtained by the banking community in the port, saying that the Central Army and the 19th Route Army had made contact on the evening of last Saturday (the 9th). Mr. Wu said that this statement was unreliable, because the Central Army's Liu Heding's troops were still stationed on the Fujian border, and even if there was contact, it would not be so fast in terms of time.</p>
<h3>Central Committee Members Remaining in Shanghai Attend Plenary Session</h3>
<p>Mr. Wu's Final Reply to Reporters: He stated that the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee is scheduled to be held in Beijing on the 20th of this month. Central Committee members from the Southwest have already sent Mr. Zhang (Ji) and others south to urge attendance. As for the Central Committee members remaining in Shanghai, most of them will attend the session in Beijing on time. He himself has been very busy with public affairs recently and has not yet had time to visit and greet them individually. He also stated that he has no significant proposals for this plenary session.</p>
<h3>Li Liejun to Telegraph All Central Committee Members</h3>
<p>Offering Opinions Before the Plenary Session, According to the Xin Sheng News Agency: Central Committee member Mr. Li Liejun, considering that the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee will soon be held in Beijing, in addition to preparing to attend in Beijing at that time, also intends to submit his usual opinions,</p>
<h3>British Ambassador to China Leaves Shanghai for Home Today</h3>
<p>Sailing on the HMS Bluebell. Sir Miles Lampson, the British Ambassador to China, has recently been reassigned as the British High Commissioner to Egypt. He has bid farewell to our Ministry of Foreign Affairs and various Chinese and foreign institutions and has presented his letter of recall to Mr. Lin Sen, Chairman of the National Government. It is now known that Sir Lampson is scheduled to depart Shanghai for home today at 2:30 PM on the Bluebell, a ship of the British shipping company. Accompanying him are his secretary, Mr. Teague-Manning, his aide, Mr. Stout, and four others. Sir Lampson's niece was injured in a plane crash and is currently recuperating in Hong En Hospital. However, her injuries are not serious, and she is expected to be discharged today and travel with Sir Lampson. Sir Lampson is scheduled to take a small fireboat from the Jianghai Customs Wharf across the river at 2:00 PM today. Various Chinese institutions and organizations, recognizing Sir Lampson's contributions to promoting friendship between China and the United Kingdom during his seven years in China, plan to see him off at the Jianghai Customs Wharf at that time. In addition, the consular corps, British Customs authorities, and Sir Lampson's friends also plan to see him off. It is reported that Sir Lampson and his party will arrive in London around November 11th or 12th.</p>
<p>X X X X X Mr. Zhang Zhi's Opinions on Releasing Political Power: He will send a telegram to the secretariat of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee, forwarding it to all executive members for their consideration, hoping to gain the sympathy of the majority of Central Committee members so that they can be realized as soon as possible. It is said that the telegram will be sent on the 14th, and it will be publicly released slightly later, in a day or two.</p>
<h3>Liu Chongjie Departs for Germany This Morning to Take Up His New Post</h3>
<p>Mr. Liu Chongjie, the newly appointed Ambassador to Germany and concurrently to Austria, departed from the Xinguang Wharf at 1:00 AM this morning, taking a small boat to the Qichang Zhan Wharf in Pudong, and boarding the Italian postal ship Conte Rosso to take up his new post in Germany. Among those who came to see him off were Mr. Liu's younger brother, Chonglun, and many relatives and friends. The ship set sail from Shanghai at 3:30 AM this morning. In addition to Mr. Liu's wife and son, the embassy secretary, Lei Xiaomin, and aide, Wang Shijing, also accompanied him. Mr. Liu expressed his determination to devote himself to promoting friendly relations between China and Germany and between China and Austria. At the time of his departure, he deeply hoped that the unfortunate events in his motherland and hometown would be resolved soon and that he would not be used by others. He especially cautioned against the instigation of third parties at this time.</p>
<h3>Commemoration of the Communist Guangzhou Uprising, Intensified Alert for Two Days</h3>
<p>Checking Suspicious Pedestrians: Yesterday was the anniversary of the Communist bandits' Guangzhou Uprising. The Chinese and foreign police authorities in this city received reports that, after the Fujian Incident, reactionary elements were taking the opportunity to cause disturbances. Therefore, a special temporary alert was announced for yesterday and today. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Special Alert</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government received a secret report beforehand, stating that yesterday was the anniversary of the Guangzhou Communist bandits' uprising and that the Communist Party in this city would take this opportunity to launch an uprising. The Municipal Government, considering that this was a critical time during the Fujian Incident, was sincerely afraid that it would affect local security. Therefore, it specially consulted the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, the Municipal Security Office, the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and the Municipal Defense Corps to temporarily intensify the alert and also sent letters to the Public Concession and French Concession Labor Bureaus requesting cooperation in the alert.</p>
<h3>Chinese Area Precautions</h3>
<p>Garrison Commander Wu Tiecheng, Security Office Director Yang Hu, Public Security Bureau Chief Wen Hongen, and the Municipal Defense Corps authorities, upon receiving orders, specially ordered the military police detectives, supervisors, and all police officers and soldiers of the various district offices under their jurisdiction to set out all day to take precautions. All quiet places such as western Shanghai, Pudong, Jiangwan, Zhenru, and the central district of the city were closed to pedestrian traffic from 3:30 PM yesterday until 8:00 AM this morning, and passwords were issued at any time.</p>
<h3>Checking Pedestrians</h3>
<p>The Public Concession and French Concession police authorities, after receiving the report, issued orders to all Chinese and Western detectives and special patrolmen to be on guard and to set up double posts in the areas bordering the Chinese Concession and to check suspicious pedestrians in quiet and prosperous locations and to prevent illegal gatherings and parades.</p>
<h3>Two-Day Martial Law</h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau, fearing that reactionary elements would delay the uprising, ordered all district offices at 7:00 AM yesterday, through Bureau Chief Wen Hongen, to prohibit gatherings of crowds and to specially dispatch armed police officers, one platoon each to the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Social Affairs Bureau, and the Education Bureau, to serve as guards. All supervisors were divided into five shifts to be on guard, each shift for three hours, from 7:00 AM to 8:00 AM the next morning. Today will also be continued for one day.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Approves Shanghai Chamber of Commerce: Tax Refund System Has Been Abolished</h3>
<p>Customs Warehouse Regulations Have Been Ordered to Be Considered and Handled. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce previously requested the Ministry of Finance to temporarily approve the refund of import taxes on rayon fabrics sold overseas and to expedite the proper drafting of regulations for customs warehouses for manufactured goods. Now, the reply has been received, stating: "Submitted note acknowledged. It has been found that the foreign goods tax refund system was abolished in April of the 20th year [of the Republic]. The situation of refunding rayon taxes for rayon fabrics sold overseas was also clearly instructed in previous approvals. The request to temporarily approve the tax refund is still not to be discussed. As for the request to draft regulations for manufacturing customs warehouses, the Customs Administration has been ordered to forward it to the General Inspectorate of Customs for consideration and handling. You are to immediately forward this to the electrical weaving factories and silk and satin trade associations for their information." This reply.</p>
<h3>The Good Reputation of Chinese Goods Overseas = Warmly Welcomed by the Dutch East Indies Government = Preferring Chinese Goods to Dominate the Dutch East Indies = Disliking Japanese Goods Flooding the Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Guidance Department of the International Trade Bureau released a message, stating: "According to a letter from the Consul in Surabaya, the Surabaya Jian Yuan Company is a sole proprietorship established by Mr. Huang Zhonghan, an overseas Chinese, specializing in import business. Recently, due to the excellence of domestic products, there is a great need to introduce them as much as possible. Therefore, its owner, Huang Zongxiao, quickly returned to Shanghai to conduct research and obtained thousands of samples from domestic factories. In the Surabaya native night market (the night market is jointly organized by the Surabaya government and merchants, once a year, for two weeks, with various new products on display for exhibition), a Chinese goods sample exhibition was held. Various samples were displayed, a dazzling array, which was highly praised by visitors, who unanimously said that domestic industry is progressing rapidly and the future is optimistic. After the night market closed, Jian Yuan Company transported all its samples to the Batavian Chamber of Commerce for display. At that time, officials of the Dutch East Indies government went to visit, and the Minister of Agriculture and Industry of the Dutch East Indies had a good evaluation. Local newspapers highly praised Chinese goods, saying that (it is better for Chinese goods to dominate the Dutch East Indies than for Japanese goods to flood the market). If Chinese goods can be promoted as much as possible in the Dutch East Indies market, the future is not pessimistic. It is hoped that domestic factories will actively contact foreign importers, and as soon as new products are available, they will send samples to foreign countries, with the consulate as the central mechanism, so that the Chinese goods market will expand day by day. It is hoped that domestic and foreign factories will pay attention to this."</p>

<h3>Thermos Bottle Manufacturing Industry Association Scheduled to Convene a General Meeting to Discuss Rectifying Market Prices and Thoroughly Investigate the Changing of Labels and Dumping of Enemy Goods</h3>
<p>At the Same Time, Officers Will Be Re-elected. The Shanghai Thermos Bottle Manufacturing Industry Association has been established for two years. Initially, there were only nine factories, including Han Chang, Lixing, Samsung, and Tongchang. Later, due to the chairman, Mr. Meng Haowu, presiding over the association's affairs, he was quite enthusiastic and deeply trusted by the industry throughout the city. As a result, the number of members has gradually increased, and eight or nine out of ten thermos bottle factories in the city have joined the association as members. However, the association has recently seen that the industry throughout the city is competing with each other on the issue of market prices, and those of a selling nature who have no manufacturing factories set up are arbitrarily causing trouble. If it is not actively rectified, it is expected that this emerging national industry will follow in the footsteps of the rubber industry and fall into an unthinkable situation. Fearing for the future, the association has scheduled a general meeting of all member representatives at Zhimeilou on Sima Road on the 16th of this month to discuss rectification measures and to re-elect executive committee members at the same time. It is also reported that the association has recently found that there is a large batch of enemy goods on the market, sold at a discount by a certain German trading company. It has also been found that one or two factories among the members have 미리 withdrawn from the association on the pretext of colluding with treacherous merchants to sell these enemy goods, which is detrimental to the business of the entire industry. Active investigations are currently underway, and as soon as conclusive evidence is collected, it will be announced to the people of the country.</p>
<h3>Life Weekly Magazine Office Searched by French Police Yesterday, A Large Number of Publications Were Seized</h3>
<p>But No One Was Arrested. Recently, the French police received a report stating that the publications issued by the Life Weekly Magazine Office at No. 2, Lane 150, Huanlong Road, contained many reactionary texts. The police authorities, upon receiving the report, immediately obtained an inspection warrant from the Second Special District Court and went to the magazine office yesterday morning to conduct a search. More than one hundred copies of publications deemed suspicious were seized on the spot. However, because the person in charge of the magazine office was still abroad, no one was arrested. The seized items were taken to the police station to await verification.</p>

<h3>Tang Youren Returned to Beijing Yesterday</h3>
<p>Did Not Meet with Japanese Ambassador Arima. Tang Youren, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, came to Shanghai a few days ago to take care of personal matters and returned to Beijing on the Shanghai-Nanjing train at 8:00 AM yesterday. It was rumored that Mr. Tang came to Shanghai to meet with Japanese Ambassador Arima to discuss the issue of Japanese residents in Fujian, but according to news from the Japanese Embassy yesterday, Mr. Tang did not meet with Arima at all, and the rumor is not true.</p>
<h3>Japanese Commander Imamura Led 27 Ships to Magong Yesterday</h3>
<p>Dispatching One Destroyer to Fuzhou. Vice Admiral Imamura, Commander of the Third Fleet of the Japanese Navy in Shanghai, boarded the flagship Izumo from Shanghai at 12:40 PM yesterday, accompanied by Staff Officer Colonel Ogaki, and ordered the four destroyers of the 27th Destroyer Division, Ashi, Hishi, Fuji, and Tsuta, to depart. Except for Tsuta, which was ordered to proceed directly to Fuzhou, the other three ships followed Imamura to the Magong naval port in the Penghu Islands. After arriving in Magong, Imamura will confer with Commander Yamauchi, who was originally stationed in Magong, on measures for dealing with Fujian. However, it is necessary to wait for Tsuta to arrive in Fujian for inspection before consulting with Colonel Sakai, the Japanese Navy officer stationed in Xiamen, and reporting the situation in Fuzhou to Magong before deciding on a response. Each Japanese ship can travel at more than 30 nautical miles per hour and will arrive in Fujian this afternoon.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Guangdong Northbound Plane Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Afternoon, Carrying Two Passengers from Fujian</h3>
<p>The China National Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Guangdong line, due to having only one plane flying, the previous northbound flight was delayed by one day due to fog, which affected the second southbound and northbound flights of the previous week, which were both postponed by one day. The northbound plane that arrived on Sunday only arrived at Longhua Airport at 12:05 PM yesterday, carrying two passengers from Fuzhou, Xu Liyou and Liu Aiqi. According to the company spokesman, the southbound flight will depart as usual on Tuesday (today), and unless the weather is prohibitive, there will be no delays.</p>
<h3>Severe Disaster Situation in Chicheng County, Chahar Province = Frequent Military Disasters and Banditry Never Ceasing = 70,000 Disaster Victims Will Become Starving Corpses = Sending a Letter to the Northeast Relief Association for Relief</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Charity Organizations Relief Federation for Refugees received a letter from the Chicheng County Provincial Association of Chahar Province yesterday (the 7th), stating: "Dear Shanghai Charity Organizations Relief Federation for Northeast Refugees, We humbly believe that benevolent people are beneficial and helpful, specializing in comforting the distressed, and righteous people donate generously, especially pitying the disaster-stricken people. It is truly virtuous and good to do good and be charitable, which is better than building a seven-story pagoda. Alas, since the fall of the Northeast,</p>
<h3>The Loss of Rehe</h3>
<p>The hardest hit is our Chicheng, especially since Chicheng is a remote border area, with barren land and poor people. Since the 15th year of the Republic, civil disasters and banditry have been frequent and never ceasing. The rural areas have long been bankrupt, and the economy is extremely exhausted. The people's lives are unbearable to ask. When Chengde and Duolun successively fell, mixed troops and defeated soldiers gathered in the county, providing forage and flying millet, even scraping and hiding everything. Since the holdings have been exhausted, there is nothing to be harvested again. The people's resources for food are completely hopeless, and the resources for housing are torn down as firewood. With no food or clothing, the houses are in ruins, a scene of desolation, which is heartbreaking to see. Throughout the wilderness, one only hears the sorrow of wild geese, and there is no sound of chickens or dogs in the villages. Dunan intends that the disaster in Chicheng will not happen alone. Before one wave has subsided, another wave arrives. Suddenly, on October 27th, the armies of Liu and Tang clashed and merged, with one taking the county town as its base camp and the other taking Dushi and Yunzhou as its bases. A small town was used as a battlefield for tens of thousands of people, and the markets were scorched earth and the houses were in ruins wherever the artillery fire reached.</p>
<h3>Tragically Died</h3>
<p>Those who were killed were all eye-catching. Livestock and cattle were all killed and eaten. Reciprocatingly advancing and retreating, the situation became a tug-of-war, miserably breaking through for more than ten days, with no empty evenings. The strong faced the enemy at the front, and the old and weak died in the artillery fire. Tens of thousands of people fled to neighboring counties, all wearing thin clothes and with no grain of rice in their stomachs. The starving faces were yellow and their eyes were unbearable to see. The Luandong theater was no better than this. In this harsh winter and snow, the misery and suffering are difficult to describe. Although the private fighting has ended, it is difficult to imagine the dead, and the general population is without clothing, food, or shelter, and the survivors after the looting are crying all day long. It is truly in need of the benevolence and righteousness of righteous people to give great charity. Otherwise, those who are fortunate enough to escape the artillery fire, even if they avoid starvation, have always admired your association, cherishing life and embracing suffering, with profound benevolence and grace, which is enjoyed far and near. The Gubaodai area has been blessed by your grace. I hope that the surviving people after the disaster in Chicheng will uphold the spirit of universal love, quickly administer the righteousness of living ants, promote the benevolence of the dead, and make my Chicheng</p>
<h3>Seventy Thousand Disaster Victims</h3>
<p>Will not die of freezing and starvation, and will be able to slightly maintain their lives. Then, the people of the entire county will keep incense burning and pray for endless blessings. The telegram is urgent, and I cannot bear to wait for the order. If you send a reply, please give it to the Chahar Province Party Department for forwarding. Combining the statements, Wu Kai, Wang Guirong, Zhao Wenwei, Zhang Hairui, Bai Zitian, Zhang Tiren, Wang Shuji, Ma Hengzhen, Li Duanyi, Wang Haiwen, Dai Pu, and Wei Tai of the Chicheng County Provincial Association of Chahar Province, respectfully.</p>
<h3>Fostering Association for the Deceased Soldiers' Vacancies, Education Expenses for the Deceased Soldiers' Families</h3>
<p>Qu Yingguang Sent Letters to Song Zheyuan, etc., for Inspection. For the sake of comforting the families of the soldiers and righteous armies who died in action in the previous war against Japan, Qu Yingguang of the Northeast Refugee Relief Association specially requested the Shanghai Patriotic Deceased Soldiers and Martyrs Family Relief Association to allocate 15,000 yuan for the education expenses of the families. He specially sent letters to Army Commanders Song Zheyuan, He Zhuguo, Shang Qiyu, Sun Dianying, and Xu Yuexiang, and Zhu Ziqiao for inspection. The original letter stated: "Dear Sir, I, Yingguang, personally visited the passes of the Great Wall this time to help the Northeast refugees. I learned that there were many soldiers and righteous armies who died in action in the previous war in the passes, and many of their families are orphans and should be given appropriate comfort in order to appease the loyal souls. I immediately replied to the Shanghai Patriotic Deceased Soldiers and Martyrs Family Relief Association, requesting that funds be allocated for the comfort and livelihood of the living. I have now received a reply approving the allocation of 10,000 yuan for the education expenses of the families of the patriotic deceased soldiers, to be deposited in a reliable bank to earn interest, and the annual interest will be distributed to the children of each family. Another 5,000 yuan will be allocated for one-time comfort expenses, to be distributed to the elderly parents, widows, etc., of each family. I am attaching 15,000 yuan and have deposited the 10,000 yuan for education expenses in the bank to earn interest. The annual interest earned is 1,000 yuan. It has been decided to distribute 50 yuan per person for the comfort expenses and 10 yuan per year for the education expenses. It is estimated that the entire army of righteous soldiers (used in Zhu's letter) will receive a one-time comfort expense of 1,000 yuan (500 yuan) and 200 yuan (100 yuan) for education expenses, which can be distributed to 20 people (10 people) each. I am attaching 40 copies (20 copies) of the survey form and respectfully request your army commander (your excellency) to order the most destitute families to fill them out and provide evidence, and submit them together for forwarding in order to issue them accordingly. This is my earnest prayer."</p>
<h3>Sino-Foreign Relief Association, Cotton Clothes for the Yellow River Flood Relief</h3>
<p>Has Been Transported to the Disaster Area in Three Batches. The Sino-Foreign Relief Association at No. 12, Renji Road, upon receiving reports of the Yellow River breach, immediately sent personnel to conduct on-site investigations. Chinese and foreign directors alike considered it a major flood and competed to offer relief. In addition to their own donations, they decided to prepare cotton clothes before the weather turned cold, so that the refugees who had escaped would have nothing to cover their bodies, which was the first priority. The bedding was completely self-made, with all new materials for the lining, cloth, and cotton, which were sturdy and durable. A total of 20,000 sets of clothes and trousers and more than 1,000 cotton quilts were made, which were transported in three batches. However, the disaster area was only affiliated with the three provinces of Shandong, Henan, and Anhui, and continuous transportation was extremely difficult. It is reported that the Ministry of Railways approved the rice price to be recorded on account and the various railway bureaus provided cars at any time. The Ruitai Heng Transportation Company enthusiastically did good deeds, taking on the responsibility of helping with shipments and errands from the Shanghai-Nanjing to the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. The association believed that the road was long and the delays along the way would be difficult to reach the disaster area in a timely manner and could not provide immediate relief. It specially dispatched a commissioner to escort the first batch of 10,000 pieces of clothing from Shanghai to Beijing. Then, the Railway Bureau kindly used barges to cross the river and was able to dispatch cars at any time to transport them to Jining, distributing them to the disaster areas in various counties in Shandong Province, which has now been distributed and reported. The second batch of 4,000 pieces of clothing and cotton quilts was transported from Shanghai to Liuhe, distributing them to the disaster areas in various counties in Henan Province. The third batch of 4,000 pieces of clothing and cotton quilts was transported from Shanghai to Tianjin-Pukou to Longhai, Pinghan, and at the Daokou Road intersection, distributing them to the disaster areas in Hebei Province, all handed over to the local branches for distribution. Now that the north wind is blowing sharply, it is hoped that the refugees will not have to sigh from the cold.</p>
<h3>Jin Xi's Arrest Case, Various French Organizations Have Risen to Help</h3>
<p>The Family Appealed to the Taxpayers' Association Again Yesterday. Jin Xi was illegally arrested by the Japanese consul. Since the incident, family representatives Chen Yang and Li Shichang, and lawyers Lou Yunmei, Xu Jie, and Luo Zhaoxin, have repeatedly reported to Mayor Wu, Premier of the Executive Yuan, and Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang, the French Consul General, and various French organizations in this port to request serious negotiations. The Municipal Government and the French Consul General have formally protested based on the naturalization certificate. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is also paying close attention to this matter, considering it to be related to national sovereignty, and has promised to do everything possible to bring Mr. Jin back as soon as possible. Powerful organizations in this port, such as the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Bar Association, the University Students' Federation, the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Public Concession, and the Citizens' Federation of the Special District, will continue to rise up and strive to demand that the Chinese and French authorities seriously protest, hoping that Mr. Jin will regain his freedom in a short time.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the family representatives of Mr. Jin, Chen and Li, and lawyers Lou and Xu, went to the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the French Concession to report the circumstances of Mr. Jin's arrest and the progress of the negotiations, and requested assistance. Chairman Cheng Zhusun received them and said that Mr. Jin's illegal arrest by the Japanese consul made all residents of the concession feel insecure, and that the matter was even more related to national sovereignty. Therefore, they should all advocate for assistance.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Communications Sets a Deadline for Prohibiting the Operation of Private Postal Agencies</h3>
<p>By the End of Next Year. According to a Central News Agency report, regarding the Ministry of Communications' restriction on the operation of private postal agencies, Zhu Menghou, Director of the General Affairs Department of the Postal Administration, told a Central News Agency reporter yesterday morning that the existence of private postal agencies and private remittance agencies has been seriously hindering postal revenue. However, in order to take care of the livelihood of some of the people who rely on it, it is necessary to set a deadline for prohibition. Therefore, it has been decided to stop by the end of next year.</p>
<p>Zhu also said that Postal Administration Director Huang Naiji, because he is about to go abroad, went to Hangzhou last week to pack his luggage and is scheduled to return to Shanghai tomorrow to meet with Minister Zhu in person to ask for instructions on everything, and then return to Shanghai, departing on the 19th.</p>
<h3>Postal Affairs Associations: Oppose Huang Naishu's Attendance at Postal Conference; Overseas Inspection Trip Actually Requires a Huge Sum of 200,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>Also Considered a Non-Urgent Matter Under the Current Postal Situation. According to the Dagong News Agency, the Shanghai Postal Affairs and Postal Employees Associations jointly sent a telegram to Zhu Xunjian, Minister of Transportation in Nanjing, stating that the inspection matter actually requires a huge sum of 200,000 yuan, which is truly a non-urgent matter under the current postal economic situation. Furthermore, the appointment of Huang Naishu as a representative is particularly unsatisfactory to the employees. In addition to having already submitted a petition, they are specially sending another telegram, earnestly requesting that the Minister, considering the postal difficulties, promptly order a halt to appease the public sentiment. With utmost sincerity, the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union and Employees' Association respectfully implore.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Ningbo-Suzhou Tobacco and Wine Industries Joint Association: Again Appeals for Revision of the New Tobacco and Alcohol System</h3>
<p>Also Requests the Removal of the Director-General and the Cancellation of Tax Refunds and Supplementary Taxes. The Shanghai-Ningbo-Suzhou Tobacco and Wine Industries Joint Association, along with Shaoxing wine merchants, previously petitioned for the revision of the new tobacco and alcohol system and requested the removal of the Tax Affairs Director-General. A response from the ministry has not been received for a long time. Yesterday, they again telegraphed Kong, Minister of Finance in Nanjing, stating, "We, the representatives, are in dire straits daily, petitioning for the revision of the new tobacco and alcohol system and requesting the removal of Tax Affairs Director-General Xie Qi, and also requesting the cessation of tax refunds and supplementary taxes. Two petitions have been submitted successively. Director Gu and Secretary Zhang were assigned to meet with us, and after detailed explanations by the representatives, they promised to convey the situation to higher authorities, hoping for consideration. However, merchants in both industries have been suffering from the constraints of the new system for five months, and the pain has reached its extreme. We urgently await being rescued from our predicament, like clouds longed for in a severe drought. In addition, the branch offices are strictly urging the payment of tax refunds and supplementary taxes, allowing no delay. What crime have the merchants committed to suffer such harsh harassment? We respectfully send this telegram, earnestly requesting that the Minister promptly grant relief in this case, first ordering the dismissal of Director Xie, who is harsh and oppressive, and appointing a virtuous and capable replacement, and simultaneously revising the new tobacco and alcohol system and cancelling tax refunds and supplementary taxes, to appease public sentiment and enrich the national treasury. We are immensely grateful." Representatives of the Shanghai-Ningbo-Suzhou Tobacco and Wine Industries Joint Association, along with Shaoxing and Jiangxi wine merchants, Zhang Dalian, Yu Xunlu, Jin Yunjie, Zhang Suhou, Zhang Nanting, and others, respectfully implore, with collective seals.</p>
<h3>Nitre and Sulfur Bureau Orders Investigation of Silver Furnaces' Stored Niter</h3>
<p>Plans to Repurchase at a Price and Prohibit Private Sales. Wang Zhixiang, Director of the Shangbao Special District Nitre and Sulfur Bureau, stated that since all silver furnaces in the city have been ordered by the Ministry of Finance to cease operations, the amount of niter they previously purchased and have in stock must be significant. Recently, there have been private sales attempting to take advantage of the situation to smuggle and sell in various places. Director Wang, under orders, plans to devise a method to repurchase the niter into government ownership at a fair price to prevent leakage and private sales, so as not to affect tax revenue. The bureau has ordered investigators to conduct a detailed investigation of the amount in stock in the industry and report it to the provincial government for repurchase, in order to alleviate the merchants' situation.</p>
<h3>Compilation of Labor-Management Disputes: Petition of Workers on the Da Zhong Steamboat</h3>
<p>The Da Zhong Steamboat Company, located at 282 South Outer Bund, purchased the Xin Ning steamboat in June of this year, renaming it the Da Fu steamboat. Manager Wang Zhenxiang then hired 31 stokers, sailors, and machinists on June 21st, immediately ordering the workers to work on the ship, preparing to sail between Shanghai and Yangzhou. The ship was moored on the Huangpu River near the Longhua Airport. It was stated that the monthly wage would be 864 yuan. However, several months have passed, and the ship has not yet sailed, and wages have not been paid. Furthermore, the workers' food supply has been stopped. Repeated requests were made to the manager, who issued a check for 300 yuan dated October 13th and a check for 600 yuan dated October 21st. However, when the workers went to cash them, the checks bounced due to insufficient funds. The workers petitioned party and government agencies for mediation, but the selling party refused to comply with the order to appear, resulting in no resolution. All the workers, having worked for five months without receiving any salary, and relying on pawnshops for their daily food and lodging, are truly in dire straits. Therefore, they sent representatives Zhang Xiang'an, Wang Anshan, Yang Tingsheng, Liu Tingzhang, Yuan Junhua, and 13 others to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday to submit a petition. Zhu Jintao of the Third Section received them. The workers stated their intentions, requesting an early mediation. The Social Affairs Bureau representative stated that the capitalist's repeated refusal to comply with the order to appear is illegal, and issuing bad checks is also a violation of criminal law. He promised to convene a conciliation immediately. If the capitalist still fails to appear, the court will be requested to issue a summons. The workers were satisfied and then dispersed.</p>
<h3>Movement for Wage Increase for Small Woodenware Workers</h3>
<p>Workers who specialize in making woodenware such as basins and buckets in the northern and southern parts of the city are demanding wage increases from their employers due to meager wages that do not cover their expenses. Yesterday afternoon, the workers gathered at Lin Chunxu's place outside the Old North Gate, saying that the wages of woodenware workers in their trade are the lowest, half of what is paid to workers making larger items. The highest-paid workers in their group earn only 11 or 12 yuan per month, while the lowest earn 6 or 7 yuan. If they stop working for a day, their wages are deducted, and they have no food. They made a request to their employers two years ago. Some employers made a slight increase of 13 or 14 yuan last year, but the other employers not only did not increase wages but also stopped the workers from working, which is very unfair. After discussion, they appointed Ni Qiaosheng, Wang Ahe, and six others to request employers to increase wages as soon as possible and demanded a response within the year.</p>
<h3>Resolution of Labor Dispute at Xiang Sheng Tannery</h3>
<p>The Xiang Sheng Tannery on Pingliang Road in Eastern Shanghai has been experiencing declining business and excessive inventory recently. Therefore, starting from the first of this month, work was reduced by ten days each month. The workers, concerned about their livelihoods, expressed their opposition and demanded that the original situation be maintained, but were unsuccessful. As a result, they all went on strike starting from the third and petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau for mediation. After receiving the petition, the bureau, fearing that the dispute would be prolonged and both parties would suffer losses, convened a conciliation yesterday. Labor representatives Zhang Yaolin and Da Yuanyi, and capitalist representative Gu Huanzhang were present. Zhu Guilin presided over the meeting, and Wang Zhiqin recorded the proceedings. First, both parties presented the circumstances of the work reduction. After mutual consultation, the following settlement was reached: (1) The factory will reduce work by one day each week. (2) The production quotas for the large workshop and the finished leather workshop should be balanced. (3) The reduction in working days will last for two and a half months. If the factory's business improves, it may be restored at any time. (4) Wages will not be paid for the reduced working days, but the factory will continue to provide meal expenses as usual. (5) The factory will pay two and a half days' wages for the strike period. Both parties expressed their agreement, signed the agreement, and announced the settlement.</p>
<h3>Weft Yarn Section of Shen Xin No. 1 Factory Resumes Work</h3>
<p>The Shen Xin No. 1 Yarn Factory in Zhoujiaqiao, Western Shanghai, was founded by Rong Zongjing and is a large-scale factory employing approximately 9,000 male and female workers. Previously, due to a sharp decline in the yarn market, the factory suddenly canceled bonuses for workers, leading to a go-slow strike that was resolved after mediation by party and government agencies. However, yesterday, over 300 female workers in the weft yarn section suddenly went on strike again to protest the factory's reform of working methods. After representatives from the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions persuaded them, they resumed work at 2 p.m.</p>

<h3>Yang Jianping Case Stalls Indefinitely ==Yang Has Gone to Fujian to Work== ==His Lawyer Has Not Arrived Either==</h3>
<p>Yang Jianping, the former director of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, was impeached by the Control Yuan for engaging in embezzlement and misappropriation of public funds during his tenure. In addition to the decision by the Commission on Disciplinary Sanctions for Public Functionaries to impose a penalty, the part involving violations of criminal law was handed over to the Shanghai First Special District District Court Procuratorate for investigation and prosecution according to law. The investigation concluded that there was suspicion of criminal activity, and a public prosecution was filed in the corresponding criminal court. However, repeated court hearings have failed to proceed because the defendant has not appeared. Now that the puppet organization in Fujian Province has emerged, it is rumored that Yang has also gone to Fujian to participate in the treasonous work of the "People's Government." Therefore, the First Special District Court has recently been unable to summon Yang to court. Yesterday afternoon was another scheduled hearing for the case, but since the defendant was not present and his defense lawyers, Xue Dubi and others, also failed to appear as scheduled, it was still impossible to start the trial. Judging from the current situation, the case is likely to be stalled for some time under the current environment.</p>
<h3>Zhenru Electric Company Entrusts Engineering Company to Assist in Reorganization</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government approved the Zhenru Electric Company to entrust the Shanghai China United Engineering Corporation to assist in management and reorganization. Since its establishment, the Zhenru Electric Company has been unable to complete its engineering setup and lacks talent for management and reorganization, resulting in a lack of progress in its operations over the years. In order to reorganize, it intends to entrust the Shanghai China United Engineering Corporation to assist in managing and reorganizing all electrical matters within its operating area. After several rounds of negotiations between the two parties, terms were agreed upon and submitted to the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau for submission to the Municipal Government for record. The Municipal Government has now approved the request.</p>

<h3>Female Communist Party Member Wang Genying Arrested ==Wang Once Served as Head of the Women's Department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions== ==Yesterday She Was Ordered to Be Handed Over to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for Investigation==</h3>
<p>Chen Geng, also known as Chen Xukang, from Hunan, is an important member of the Communist Party and has held important positions in the past. In recent months, he served as the head of the Second Section of the Communist Party's intelligence department in Shanghai, secretly engaging in illegal activities. After the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau learned of this, it cooperated with the Public Concession Police to arrest Chen and hand him over to the Second Branch of the High Court for adjudication and then to the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation. When detectives arrested Chen, they confiscated a photograph of a woman. After investigation, it was learned that the woman was Chen's wife, Wang Genying, a native of this city, 28 years old, and also an important member of the Communist Party. She serves as the head of the Women's Department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and her influence is no less than that of her husband. Although she has been repeatedly pursued, she has never been captured. Until the day before yesterday, the Inspection Department of the Municipal Public Security Bureau learned that Wang was living with her younger brother at No. 29 Yaojiaqiao in Zhabei. Detectives were immediately dispatched to investigate and found Wang and her younger brother inside the house. They were taken to the Public Security Bureau. However, when passing Dongyouheng Road in the Public Concession, Wang suddenly refused to go to the Public Security Bureau, resulting in a dispute. The police arrived, took Wang Genying into custody, and after questioning, the head of the police ordered Wang to be detained. Yesterday morning, she was escorted to the Second Branch of the High Court. The Chief Judge of the Criminal Division, Yu Hua, along with two judges, Zhou and Jiang, held a hearing and interrogated her. The police lawyer, Li Zhishan, stated that the defendant's residence was not in the concession, and the crime also occurred in the Chinese area. Therefore, he did not object to the Public Security Bureau's request for transfer. The representative of the Municipal Public Security Bureau stated that after confiscating the defendant's photograph, it was identified by a Communist Party member who surrendered as the head of the Women's Department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. Furthermore, her husband, Chen Geng, has also repented and voluntarily surrendered after being sent to Nanjing.</p>
<p>It is now unknown where Geng is, whether he has been arrested or not. Chief Judge Yu reviewed the confession and ordered Wang Genying to be sent to the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Foreigners Taking Photographs of Women's Bound Feet: National Government Issues Prohibition Order</h3>
<p>Malicious Propaganda Involving National Prestige. Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, reported based on a report from Liu Jianqun, Director of the Political Training Department of the Beiping Military Sub-Council, based on a report from Zhu Chongguang, an inspector of the Political Training Department of the 29th Army under his command, that recently, foreigners in various villages around Zhangjiakou, without the permission of the local government agencies, took photographs of Chinese old-fashioned women's bound feet for malicious propaganda. This is very inappropriate, and the evil custom of foot-binding is a matter that our country has issued orders to strictly prohibit. As for remote and backward areas, there may be places that have not been reached, and it is unavoidable that women of middle age or older cannot release their feet to become natural feet in fact. The foreigner did not obtain permission from our government and did not understand our overall national situation. He extracted fragments of the evil customs left over from the previous era and rashly used them for malicious propaganda, which is even more inappropriate and involves national prestige. Photos were attached, requesting approval for strict prohibition. After receiving the report, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek investigated and found that under international law, foreigners must obtain permission from the local government of the host country to take photos in the host country. Otherwise, no photos are allowed. It is reported that this matter has been submitted to the National Government and handed over to the Civil Affairs Office to issue orders to all provincial and municipal governments across the country for strict investigation.</p>

<h3>Radio Exhibition</h3>
<p>Admission Tickets Reduced to Two Jiao. The Radio Exhibition opened on Saturday, and the grand occasion has been reported in the previous newspaper. It has been heard that the organizers of the exhibition felt that the previous system of charging different fees for admission tickets at different times was cumbersome and inconvenient for visitors. Therefore, it has been decided that from today until the 23rd, a uniform fee of two jiao will be charged from 10:00 AM to 10:00 PM daily. Each admission ticket can be used for a lottery draw at the Aviation Highway Construction Lottery Display Area for a chance to win ten yuan, five yuan, one yuan, and other lottery prizes worth up to 500,000 yuan.

It is heard that Director Wen has instructed all district offices under his jurisdiction to pay attention to this matter after receiving the order.</p>
<h3>Fei Guoxi's Lawsuit Declared Not Guilty</h3>
<p>Lawyer Fei Guoxi has been practicing law in Shanghai for many years. Recently, Hu Yan, the victim of a theft, filed a lawsuit against him in the Shanghai District Court for fraud for demanding 50 yuan in legal fees, and also filed a civil suit seeking compensation of 179 yuan, 7 jiao, and 8 fen. After Judge Zhang Peiming heard the case, Hu Yan claimed that the 50 yuan in legal fees paid was for the purpose of securing parole for her husband, Hu Fengwu, who was a thief, and that she had been defrauded. However, Fei Guoxi claimed that it was for legal counsel and divorce fees. The testimonies of both parties were conflicting. Yesterday, the verdict was announced: Fei Guoxi was not guilty, and the plaintiff's civil suit was dismissed. The reasons given were that Hu Yan's husband, Hu Fengwu, was involved in a theft case and could not live peacefully in Shanghai. He entrusted legal counsel and handled the divorce, with a total legal fee of 150 yuan. He paid 50 yuan in advance. Hu Yan requested a refund of the legal fees because the divorce was blocked. The defendant stated that even if the divorce could not be handled, the counsel fee should be calculated at half, which would still be 75 yuan. Therefore, he did not agree and did not admit that there was a parole matter. He also presented a post card dated April 3 from Wang Yunsheng, on which was written "Hu Yan entrusted me to ask a Shanghai lawyer for legal counsel and also wants a divorce." After the court verified the handwriting of Wang Yunsheng, it was the same. Wang Yunsheng was also asked and admitted that what he wrote was true and that he had not heard of any parole matters. According to the law, if the suspicion of criminal charges cannot be proven, a verdict of not guilty should be made, and the accompanying civil suit should be dismissed.</p>
<h3>After Implementation of the New Measurement System, the Rice Industry Implements the "Jiao Hu"</h3>
<p>The Dou and Hu meters used by the rice shops and other businesses in the North and South Rice Trade Association in the city were calibrated in spring, summer, autumn, and winter. After the new Hu, which uses eight dou and five sheng as a shi, was adopted this year, the dates for the calibration were slightly changed. The association held a special meeting and decided that the period for the "Jiao Hu" in the western season, which was usually scheduled for four periods in February, May, August, and November, should be followed. However, since the rice Hu was changed to the new Hu, the scheduled dates for the "Jiao Hu" also had to be rescheduled. After discussion, it was decided that each "Jiao Hu" would be changed to March, June, September, and December, with four calibrations. The association has notified all colleagues, so the confirmed November date for the winter "Jiao Hu" was not held. Instead, the association rescheduled the December date for the winter "Jiao Hu" and decided on the 11th and 12th during a recent meeting.</p>
<h3>Great Shanghai Shines Brightly: Kolman Visits</h3>
<p>The "Great Shanghai" Grand Theater on Nanjing Road, Xizang Road, has been showing "The Chase" (女性的追逐) for over a week. Those who have seen it have all praised it, especially the theater's sound, lighting, and seats. At 9:15 last night, Kolman, the American star (presumably the star of "The Sheik"), visited. He praised the theater's equipment highly. Manager Li of the theater received him and presented him with a cigarette case as a souvenir.</p>
<p>The meeting was held and the North and South colleagues were notified by the Association. Yesterday was the first day of the "Jiao Hu", and the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, the various committees of the Association, and the rice industry organizations of the North and South gangs were invited to the site to supervise the calibration. Twenty-four "Hu Si" (calibrators) were pre-selected by the Association for the calibration. To avoid the disputes that arose during last year's calibration, extra caution was taken this time. After Chairman Gu Xinji, Executive Committee members Chen Ziyi, Zhu Zixiang, Yan Xiaoquan, Cai Yuhun, the representatives from the Social Affairs Bureau, and the representatives from various organizations arrived at 10:00 AM, Chairman Gu reported that the rice industry colleagues have always used the "sea Hu" for business transactions, which is no longer applicable. Starting this year, the new Hu will be used. However, the "Hu Zi" is very important, so we have specially invited you to supervise the calibration. After the report, the calibration began. The "Hu Zi" from each shop was first inspected one by one, and then the "Hu Si" was ordered to calibrate them. After the calibration, the "Ren Gu Gong Suo", "Nan Bang Gong Suo", and "Chang Bang Gong Suo" together pasted the calibration list and added a branding iron to the Hu, taking extraordinary care. A total of over 350 "Hu Zi" were calibrated throughout the day. The calibration was stopped at 4:00 PM, with half of them still uncalibrated. The calibration will continue tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Establishment of the Tea Industry Trade Association</h3>
<p>The Shanghai tea industry, a major exporter of tea, once boasted over a hundred businesses producing 100,000 chests of tea annually. In recent years, it has declined, with only forty-odd businesses remaining, producing slightly over 40,000 chests. The reasons for the decline are attributed to the increasing production of tea in Eastern Japan, India, and Ceylon (Sri Lanka), while China's production has decreased due to a lack of unity and poor improvement. People in the tea industry, realizing that without improvement, they would be eliminated, have to seek development and improvement in order to restore the industry to its former glory. This is vital to protect and increase production and international livelihoods. Therefore, initiated by individuals such as Wang Lizhai, the Tea Industry Trade Association was organized. After months of preparation, the inaugural meeting was held yesterday (the 11th) at the Yangzhuang Tea Industry Trade Association's headquarters. Over thirty members attended, along with representatives from the Municipal Party Department Zhu Yaokui, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau Song Mingqing, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Yuan Hongjun, who were present to guide and supervise. The meeting began at 10:00 AM, with Yu Jinming elected as temporary chairman and Wang Xuchu as secretary. After formalities, the association's charter and business rules were passed. On the spot voting elected Peng Zhiping, Ding Jiaying, Qian Ziliang, Wang Lizhai, Zheng Jianyuan, Dai Shiyuan, and Lu Jiamao as executive members, and Zhuo Huapu and Sun Zifu as alternate executive members. They were sworn into office.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Xiao Tianqing Plans a Civilian Village in the City Center</h3>
<p>Xiao Tianqing, an overseas Chinese from Zhongshan, Guangdong, renowned in Nanyang for his enthusiasm for education and charitable ventures, aims to relieve poverty. Recently, he returned to Shanghai from Singapore and plans to build a civilian village in the central area of Shanghai to address the housing problems of the poor. Yesterday, Mr. Xiao met with a construction expert from Pingbu for a long discussion. His plan involves purchasing dozens of acres of land specifically to build simple, single-story houses. The land and construction costs will be borne entirely by him personally. Once the village is completed, it will charge the lowest possible rent to cover the village's annual expenses. It is said that the rent for each house will not exceed two yuan.</p>
<h3>The Necessity of Cracking Down on "Wild Chicken" Carriages</h3>
<p>Recently, the Public Works Department announced a crackdown on "wild chicken" carriages. Some people believe that this action has little to do with improving the conditions of rickshaws. However, the abuses of "wild chicken" carriages are significant. Although their crackdown is only one aspect of the improvement plan, it cannot be ignored. The number of public rickshaws within the concession, i.e., yellow rickshaws, was limited to 10,000 (the actual number of licenses issued is 9,990). However, the number of private carriages has continued to increase. In the spring of this year, 11,908 private carriage licenses were issued, and in winter, they sharply increased to 13,196, an increase of 1,288. Such an increase in private carriages is abnormal, and it is difficult to ensure that there is no organization of "wild chicken" carriages fraudulently obtaining licenses to compete with yellow rickshaws for business. The police have many difficulties in cracking down on these "wild chicken" carriages, and it is difficult to implement without public assistance. Furthermore, during busy daytime hours in the central district, it often occurs that passengers hire yellow rickshaws and instruct them to wait in no-parking zones, resulting in the rickshaw pullers being fined or driven away, thus losing their fare. In terms of enforcement, the authorities cannot but implement the regulations, and the rickshaw pullers suffer greatly. It is hoped that passengers will understand this situation and alleviate the suffering of the rickshaw pullers.</p>
<h3>Falling and Injuring Oneself Outside a Store</h3>
<p>Chen Arong, 35 years old, was a shop assistant at Yixing Rice Store on Dalian Bay Road. Yesterday afternoon at about 5:00 PM, he accidentally slipped and fell on the streetcar tracks on Xin Zha Road. His left leg was crushed by a streetcar, and he bled profusely. A policeman saw it, immediately reported to the Fire Brigade, and sent an ambulance to Bao Long Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Ma Fang's Suicide by Hanging Due to Gambling</h3>
<p>Ma Encheng from Shaoxing, a worker, lived in Shibajian area in Pudong. He married Ma Fang, who was 23 years old. Because Ma's income was calculated by the day, his household expenses were also paid on a daily basis, so although poor, there was no risk of starvation. However, recently, flower clubs have become popular, and ignorant women are easily lured into them. Ma Fang also indulged in it as if it were her life, transferring her daily living expenses to bets. As a result, they ran out of food the day before yesterday and were forced to ask her husband for more than one day's expenses. However, Ma had no extra money and hated gambling, so an argument ensued. The woman was so angry that she hanged herself that night. When her husband found out yesterday morning, her body was already stiff. He immediately reported to the second precinct of the third district, who ordered the local constable to report to the local court. The court then appointed prosecutor Li and forensic examiners to the scene, and after examination, confirmed that she had died by hanging and ordered the body to be collected and investigated.</p>
<h3>Retired Soldier Exposed for Trafficking Children, Cai Shen Discovers Her Conscience and Four Children are Rescued</h3>
<p>Fu Qing, a 53-year-old from Henan, hanged himself in the police station out of fear of punishment. He used to be a soldier but retired due to old age. He came to Shanghai and became a beggar and then a child trafficker. He lured boys and girls from various places in the interior to Shanghai for profit. In the past two months, he lured four orphaned boys, Wang Suer (10 years old), Fang Xier (8 years old), Zhou Ruyi (9 years old), and Wu Mayi (7 years old), from Kaifeng and Zhengzhou in Henan, intending to take them to Xiamen to sell. Because it was inconvenient for him to travel alone with the four children, he entrusted a fellow beggar and relative, Li Shen (43 years old), with the task, promising her a substantial reward. They pretended that each was taking two boys as their own sons to avoid suspicion. At the end of last month, after arriving in Shanghai, he colluded with his fellow trafficker from his hometown, Ge Zhengqing and Zhang Huchen, intending to go to Fujian together for sales. Since the Shanghai-Fujian route was temporarily suspended, they could not leave immediately. On the evening of the 27th, they checked into rooms 96 and 102 at the Southeast Hotel, No. 12, Taiyuan Lane, Xizilaihuo Street, French Concession, leaving the four children to be watched over by Shen, and confining them in room 96. Fu, Ge, and Zhang stayed in room 102 opposite, and forbade the children to make noise. The next day at noon, Li Shen suddenly had a moment of conscience in the room, burst into loud cries, and was asked by the hotel servant Zhou A-quan about the situation. He then told the accountant who then reported to the French police. Detective Xu Kaisao and others rushed to the scene and arrested Fu and the four women and four children. They took them to the police station and transferred them to the Second Special District Court. The police lawyer accused the defendants of enticing for profit. Judge Xiong Huiping questioned them, the interrogation was concluded, and the sentencing was scheduled for the 13th. All the details had been reported. The defendants were detained in the detention center downstairs in the Loujiawan Central Police Station awaiting instructions. Unexpectedly, Li Shen, who was detained in the detention center, suddenly became desperate the night before last, took off her broad gauze belt used for tying her feet, tied it to the iron bars of the detention center, and hanged herself. It was not until 3:30 yesterday morning that the guard Yue found her and tried to rescue her, but she had already died. He immediately reported to the police chief, who sent a corpse truck to the Tongren Fu Yuan branch for examination. Yesterday morning, he reported to the Second Special District Court and appointed Prosecutor Wang Ren to the place to verify that the deceased Li Shen had committed suicide by hanging herself before her death. Because there were no family members in Shanghai, the court ordered the body to be handed over to the Tongren Fu Yuan Hall for photographing and burial. The four sections of the gauze belt used for suicide were kept on file for reference.</p>
<h3>Anhui Bandits Accuse Detective Zhang Kewen of Extortion</h3>
<p>Quan Liting (also known as Quan Guangyi, 33 years old this year) and Wei Zizhen (also known as Wei Zhong, also known as Wei San, 57 years old this year), both from Anhui Province and former heads of the local militia in Suzhou, Anhui, are notorious bandit leaders who have committed major cases of kidnapping, robbery, murder, and arson. After the Anhui Provincial Government issued an arrest warrant, they fled to Shanghai and lived at No. 3 Siming Village, Foch Road, French Concession. Recently, Liu Junqing, a Chinese detective from the Old Zhabei Police Station of the Public Concession, learned of their whereabouts and dispatched Detective Zhang Kewen (25 years old), also from Anhui, to Quan and Wei's residence on the evening of the 3rd of this month to investigate the truth. Quan and others preemptively reported to the French Police, accusing Zhang of intimidation and extortion of 300 yuan, requesting an investigation. When the police dispatched detectives, they took Zhang and the accusers Quan and Wei to the police station for investigation. After Zhang explained, the police chief ordered them all to be detained for investigation. The next day, the Old Zhabei Police Station sent detectives to the French Police to take Quan and Wei and send them to the First Special District Court for detention, awaiting dispatch of officials from the Anhui Provincial Government to take them away. All details have been recorded in previous reports. The French Police yesterday sent Zhang to the Second Special District Court for questioning in connection with Quan and Wei's accusation of extortion. They also subpoenaed Liu Boshou (resident of No. 39 Siming Village, formerly employed in the military), who was present at the time, as a witness. The two accusers were also sent by the British Police for questioning. Judge Wu Fanglian questioned them in the First Criminal Court. First, the police lawyer Fei Xizhen explained the case and prosecuted under Article 370 of the Criminal Law for the crime of intimidation. Then, the accusers Quan Liting and Wei Zizhen stated that the defendant Zhang Kewen had extorted 300 yuan. Witness Liu Boshou also testified. Zhang Kewen denied extorting money from Quan and Wei, stating that he was sent by the detectives to investigate the truth. The police lawyer then argued that although the defendant had not received any money, he had committed the crime of attempted intimidation and requested that he be dealt with according to law. The defendant was defended by lawyer Jiang Yiping. As a result, the court ordered the end of the debate, scheduled sentencing for the 16th, and released the defendant on a surety of 500 yuan pending further instructions. After the questioning, the two accusers were still taken back to the British Police Station by the detectives for detention.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Woman Sues Wushi for Abandonment</h3>
<p>Zhang Zhu, a 27-year-old woman from Suzhou, residing at No. 16 Yiye Lane, Geller Road, French Concession, accused Zhang Fushou, a 30-year-old Wushi practitioner from Changshu, of malicious abandonment due to his affection for another woman. The two eloped and lived together when Zhang Zhu was 19, for eight years, but without proper marriage rites. They had four children, the eldest son Caiyuan, now seven years old, the second daughter who died young, the second son Sanxing, now three years old, and the fourth son Sixing, born in February this year. The relationship between the two was initially harmonious, but recently Zhang suddenly changed and became enamored with Yang Peixuan, a female calligrapher singing at the Qunfanghui in the Great World (Zhang's apprentice), and cohabited with her at a certain number on Pingjili Road, abandoning Zhu and her children. It was not until July of this year that Zhu learned of their residence, but when she went to argue, they had moved and disappeared. On September 13, she encountered Zhang and Yang walking together on the road and went forward to argue, but was beaten together. After the crowd dispersed them, she could not find them again. Therefore, Zhu was forced to take the children to face Zhang. If they were abandoned, how could she raise them in the future? So, in the name of the children, in her name as legal guardian, she commissioned lawyer Li Feng to file a complaint with the Criminal Court of the First Special District Court, accusing Zhang Fushou and Yang Peixuan of malicious abandonment, requesting investigation, and attaching a civil suit, requesting the court to order the defendant to pay 20,000 yuan for alimony, education, and marriage expenses in one lump sum. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, Judge Xiong opened a court session, but the defendants did not appear in court because they could not be notified. Only the plaintiff, Zhang Zhu, holding the children, came to court with her lawyer and said that Zhang Fushou was working every night at the Fuxinggong Woodware Shop, next to the Sanshan Guild Hall on the Fourth Road, and Yang Peixuan was singing at the Republic Hall in the Great World, and asked the court to summon them to the above places. The judge ordered the postponement of the hearing until the defendants could be summoned.</p>
<h3>Three People Froze to Death in the Cold</h3>
<p>The weather has been getting colder recently, with piercing north winds, especially in the evening. Therefore, the poor who have no clothes are gradually freezing to death. The night before last, three people froze to death: (1) A male corpse was found frozen to death east of Xinbang Bridge, Wan'an Bridge, Jiangwan Road. He was about 40 years old, wearing a tattered blue cloth short shirt and tattered padded pants, bareheaded and barefoot. The local constable Qu Baoshan reported to the local court. (2) A male corpse was found dead in Ruikang Lane, Difengwei Road, Zhabei. He was about 40 years old, wearing a black cloth jacket, a yellow tattered military coat, a black padded jacket, and blue cloth pants, bald and barefoot. Because he had no family, the local constable Li Areported to the local court. (3) A male corpse was found dead on Nanxing Road, Zhabei. He was about 60 years old, wearing black cotton-padded jacket and pants, bald and barefoot. He had no family. The local constable of the tenth division of the fourth district, Shen Shaohe, reported to the local court. For all three cases, Prosecutor Li and others were appointed to the scene to verify the deaths by freezing and ordered that the charities collect and bury the bodies and seal the coffins until claimed.</p>
<h3>An Inexperienced Midwife Almost Caused Three Deaths</h3>
<p>- Although Two Sons Survived, the Mother Died - Wang Liangbiao, a carpenter from Ningbo who lived at No. 80, Tongzhou Road, had a wife, Qian, who was 23 years old. She was pregnant for a full term and gave birth yesterday at 2:00 AM. A 50-year-old midwife named Zhang was hired to deliver the baby. She gave birth to two sons one after another, but her abdomen was still large. Unexpectedly, when removing the placenta, she mistakenly took out the woman's uterus. Blood flowed profusely, and the midwife continued to pull forcefully, causing the woman to faint and the two children to suffocate and become silent. The family was greatly alarmed and hired female doctor Qian Shu and Dr. Wang Yingshi from the Hongkou Public Maternity Hospital for diagnosis and treatment. In the end, because the woman's uterus had been pulled down with force, resulting in excessive bleeding, although surgery was used to remove the placenta and the uterus was placed back in its original position, and life-saving injections were given, it was too late and all efforts were in vain. Only the two children were resuscitated with artificial respiration. The woman's life was lost at the hands of an ignorant midwife. Alas, how tragic!</p>
<h3>A Truck Crushes a Girl to Death</h3>
<p>Zhou Lian, a 10-year-old girl from Tongzhou, was walking on Xinji Bang Road in Hongkou yesterday afternoon at about 3:00 PM when she was suddenly struck by a cargo truck with concession license plate number 12349. Her skull was crushed, and she was barely breathing. She was immediately rushed to the hospital in a car by a policeman, but she died shortly after. The hospital then transferred her body to the post-mortem examination office on Feilun Road, awaiting a report to the court for post-mortem examination this morning.</p>
<h3>Fire at Ninghe Road</h3>
<p>A certain shop at No. 2307, Ningwu Road, Yangshupu, suddenly caught fire by accident yesterday afternoon at about 9:00 PM. Thick smoke filled the air and the fire blazed brightly. The fire brigade heard the alarm and rushed to the scene to extinguish the fire. About four buildings were destroyed.</p>

<h3>National Coal Mining Industry's Annual Meeting the Day Before Yesterday = Resolved to Petition for Prompt Amendment of the Mining Law = = Plan to Issue Public Bonds or Allocate Cotton and Wheat Loans =</h3>
<p>The National Mining Association held its 21st annual meeting in Shanghai at 3:00 PM the day before yesterday to discuss the need to amend the mining law, hold a joint national mining, metallurgy, and geology exhibition, issue 20 million yuan in public bonds, or allocate cotton and wheat loans, and re-elect eleven directors and five alternate directors. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Holding the Annual Meeting</h3>
<p>Mining merchants attending the annual meeting included representatives from Huadong, Zhongyuan, Jingxing, Changxing, Datong, Zhongxing, and Liuhegou, such as Li Zushen, Li Yangchong, Gu Zonglin, Gu Zhanran, and Zhang Duchen. The meeting was chaired by Director Li Zushen, who reported on the association's activities over the past year. They then began discussing various proposals. After a long period of discussion, they decided and elected eleven directors and five alternate directors for the current term and adjourned late into the night. Former Director Li Zushen went to his hometown in Ningbo yesterday due to personal matters. The first meeting was originally scheduled for last night, but was postponed.</p>
<h3>Amending the Mining Law</h3>
<p>Regarding amending the mining law or forming a specialized committee to conduct detailed research, and requesting a prompt submission to the Executive Yuan for transfer to the Legislative Yuan to quickly deliberate and revise the key points that should be amended, it was resolved and passed. The reason is that the previous mining law favored state-owned enterprises and imposed strict restrictions on private mining, making amendment necessary. It was later heard that the Legislative Yuan was drafting a constitution, and special attention should be paid to the issue of amending the mining law. At the previous general meeting, it was resolved that the board of directors should first elect representatives to go to the Legislative Yuan to negotiate the amendment of the mining law. Subsequently, the board of directors decided to wait until the procedures were clarified before proceeding. Mr. Lou, the representative stationed in Beijing, had been informed to inquire about the procedures for attending the amendment of the mining law in the Yuan. However, it was found that the mining law had been promulgated for three years, and not only was it unsuitable for the national situation, but it also created many obstacles. This spring, the Minister of Industry and Commerce issued a notice to all parties, soliciting opinions to determine the standard for proposing amendments. Mr. Li Yangchong, a director of the association, had submitted his opinions, which were very pertinent to the points that should be amended, including all mining construction, equipment, security, and hazard prevention, which were all summarized. Now, upon receiving the letter from Director Li Yangchong, it is suggested that it be listed as a proposal, submitted to the general meeting for discussion, or that a specialized committee be formed to conduct detailed research, and that the results be compiled and submitted to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for review, and that the key points that should be amended be promptly submitted to the Executive Yuan for transfer to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation. It is appropriate to attach the original manuscript of Director Li's report to the Minister of Industry and Commerce requesting the amendment of the mining law, and submit it to the general meeting for deliberation.</p>
<h3>Plan to Issue Public Bonds</h3>
<p>(2) A proposal to issue 20 million yuan in coal mining public bonds, or to allocate cotton and wheat loans, was resolved and passed. The reason is that in order to increase domestic coal production capacity, the National Coal Relief Committee was consulted, and the government was earnestly requested to issue 20 million yuan in coal mining public bonds, dedicated to the urgent needs of various mines and the development of production facilities. A draft of the public bond regulations was also prepared and submitted to the Ministries of Finance and Industry and Commerce for review. Furthermore, it was proposed at the meeting of mining merchants of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce on June 1 this year that bonds be issued. Subsequently, in view of the fact that various mines have been suffering from hardship and were being forced to sell foreign coal, affecting their business for a long time, the bleak situation this year was even more severe than last year, and it would be useless to issue them quickly. In addition to submitting them to the Ministries of Finance and Industry and Commerce again, they also met with the authorities to explain the whole story in order to implement it as soon as possible. However, the state treasury is now empty and the people are not wealthy. At a time when commerce is declining and failing, the issuance of huge public bonds should be carefully considered in terms of the protection of principal and interest and the effectiveness of their use. Therefore, it is proposed to allocate loans based on the cotton and wheat loan distribution method. Mr. Xie, a director, also drafted supplementary reasons and submitted them to the board of directors for discussion. Currently, this association and the National Coal Relief Committee are deliberating on this bond issuance proposal. At this general meeting, the cause and origin of the case will be reported to the public for review and hopefully discussed for solutions.</p>
<h3>Hold an Exhibition</h3>
<p>(3) A proposal to hold a joint national mining, metallurgy, and geology exhibition was approved and passed (reason and date). Previously, Beiyang Institute of Technology initiated a joint exhibition with this association, the Mining and Metallurgical Engineering Society, and the Geological Survey Institute. The purpose was to promote the past achievements of the mining and metallurgical industries, integrate the ability to cultivate talent, build good models, and develop new initiatives. Internally, it can enhance the feelings of mutual connection in the mining industry, and externally, it can promote and attract the attention of the outside world. Representatives from each group were elected to jointly organize a preparatory committee and agreed to hold the exhibition from June 21 to July 10 next year at the Beiyang Institute of Technology in Tianjin. This association successively appointed Mr. Cao Shengzhi and Director Li Zushi and Director Gu Zhanran as representatives to participate together. Later, since Mr. Gu was unable to be there, he entrusted Mr. Lou Luqing as his representative. Since Mr. Cao served as the general secretary of the society, the representative seat of this association was changed to Director Li Yangchong as his successor. However, this exhibition is still a pioneering undertaking in China, related to the prosperity and decline of the mining industry. All of our members should enthusiastically participate. In addition to sending letters to solicit various mining products and specimens and models to be sent directly to the association for display, what opinions do you have about this exhibition? Please give instructions and proposals. Please make a decision.</p>
<h3>Elected Directors</h3>
<p>The list of newly elected directors for the current term is as follows: Eleven directors: Zhang Zhongping, Li Zushen, Li Zuen, Wang Rutang, Wang Zimin, Wang Junshi, Yang Linzhai, Gu Zonglin, Gu Zhanran, Zhu Yonghe, Qian Xinzhi. Five alternate directors: Zhang Duchen, Xie Hengchuang, Zhou Shusheng, Li Yangchong, Chang Xuchun.</p>
<h3>Submission to the Ministry of Industry</h3>
<p>A document for submission to the Ministry of Industry was also passed during the general meeting. The original text is as follows: Respectfully submitted, we have received your letter of February 10th, stating that the promulgation of the Mining Law has been nearly three years, and the impact has been widely seen and heard. Tracing back to the beginning of the legislation, it was originally considered repeatedly in order to achieve perfection. However, with the changing times, it may be necessary to reconsider, and practical obstacles may not have been completely eliminated. Now, as the country is striving to revitalize the mining industry, it is imperative to deeply understand and make adjustments to the above fundamental regulations, so as to align with the national conditions. We have long admired your extensive experience in the mining industry. Regarding the various provisions of the Mining Law, if there are any points that should be modified, we earnestly request that you provide detailed opinions based on the actual situation, and submit them to the Ministry before the end of April of this year, so that the Ministry can synthesize opinions from all parties and determine the standards for proposing revisions. The future of the mining industry relies on this. Upon receiving this, we believe that the principles for formulating industrial laws and regulations should be to benefit the country and the people and to suit the national conditions. Deliberating on improvements requires careful consideration of social customs and the level of the people, as well as reference to international trends, so that progress can be made gradually. Sweeping reforms are unlikely to yield good results. Our nation's three mining regulations adopt the principle of state ownership and private operation. Except for coal, oil, and salt, which are exclusively operated by the state, and iron ore, which is specially permitted for private operation, other mineral products are allowed to be explored and mined by the people in accordance with the law. Although sometimes intermittent due to the influence of the current situation, there have been no major obstacles in the past ten years or so. Unexpectedly, in the past three years, since the promulgation of the Mining Law, the psychology of the people has been vastly different from the past. Mining operators, who once regarded the mining industry as a source of profit, are now full of doubts and hesitate to move forward, viewing it as a daunting task. The 19th-year Mining Law is based on the principle of state ownership and state operation restricting private operation. However, considering the reality, state-owned mining has not yet been established, while private mining has long been on the verge of bankruptcy. Those with slight beginnings and some success have either been destroyed by soldiers and bandits, suspending work, or are barely surviving to maintain their employees. Having suffered the pain of internal strife in the past, we now face the invasion of foreign enemies. If we do not quickly and fundamentally remedy the situation, I fear that the decline of the mining industry will worsen day by day, and the future will be unimaginable. Fortunately, Your Excellency has recognized this and is currently examining national conditions and deliberating on modifications to the mining laws and regulations, generously seeking broad consultations and soliciting opinions. We are honored to have been consulted and dare not refrain from presenting our humble views. We hope for your consideration. (1) Clearly stipulate the protection of private mining operations. Most of our country's mining operations are privately run. In recent years, they have suffered greatly from the impact of the current situation, facing immense losses, running out of resources, or having already stopped work, or barely surviving. In recent years, although mining entrepreneurs have the desire to develop, the Mining Law has severely restricted private mining operations, offering little convenience. At this critical moment when the mining industry is on the verge of collapse, the government's efforts to vigorously promote protection are still insufficient. Therefore, to develop the mining industry, it is essential to guide it according to the situation and provide private mining operations with adequate protection. Here are a few points, elaborated below: (A) It is advisable to implement the protection of private mining operations, so that they receive the same restrictions and guarantees as state-owned mining operations. The state ownership of mineral resources, in principle, is owned by all the people of the country. The government has the obligation to implement it but not the exclusive right to enjoy it. Therefore, the mining policy advocates that people's enterprises and state-owned enterprises should complement each other. For state-owned enterprises, it advocates the use of foreign capital to cultivate national capital. For people's enterprises, it advocates the adoption of lenient mining laws to promote the development of the mining industry. The meaning is to enable the government to use foreign capital on the one hand to implement the most economical methods to operate mining industries that the people cannot operate, and on the other hand to formulate lenient laws to promote people's operation, so as to avoid blocking mining benefits. To achieve the co-existence of the two, mining operations, whether state-owned or private, should be subject to the same legal restrictions and guarantees, so that they can develop together. The current Mining Law tends to favor state-owned mining operations, while imposing strict restrictions on private mining operations, which seems to be biased. If the country's economic strength is sufficient, and honest people can lead with perfect organization and sincere unity, then any undertaking can be state-owned, not just the mining industry. The success of the Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan lies in this. In this autumn of deepening national crisis and declining people's livelihood, the government and the people should cooperate to save the country, but still fear being unable to achieve it. Now, private mining operations have in fact suffered significant damage, and are subject to strict restrictions in law. Not only has production sharply declined, but within a few years, private mining operations will inevitably disappear. The regulations stipulate that state-owned mining operations are not subject to any restrictions and can rely on special privileges, convenient actions, and superior positions to infringe upon private mining operations, abandoning the fundamental and seeking the superficial, competing with the people for profit, only causing fear among the people, which is not the way to develop the mining industry. As for maintaining the security of mining areas, protecting private mining factories, prohibiting apportionment and extortion, and suppressing worker riots, etc., it must also be clearly stipulated and included in the law, so that private mining operations can obtain full protection. It is appropriate to promote people's enterprises on the one hand, and reduce restrictions on the mining industry on the other hand, so that state-owned mining operations and private mining operations can develop together, which is the most urgent task. (B) Mining priority rights, except for stipulating state-owned mineral products and demarcating state reserve areas, should be based on the order of people's applications and must abolish the priority rights of county and municipal governments. According to the three mining regulations of the Republic of China, the acquisition of mining rights adopts the priority system, and the approval of mining rights is determined based on the order of applications. This not only adopts an open and clear principle, eliminates classes, and encourages pioneers, which is enough to encourage the enterprising spirit of entrepreneurs, but also adopts a fair method, which can eliminate various malpractices in administration. The system is very good. Not only do most countries' regulations adopt it, but it has also been implemented in China for more than ten years without any obstacles. However, Articles 5 and 20 of the Mining Law stipulate that county and municipal governments in the location of the mineral product have priority rights, which is both costly to explain and hinders implementation. If it is said that it is granted by Article 11 of the Founding Program, then it not only contradicts the principles of state ownership of mineral resources and state operation of mining in the Mining Law, but also uses the qualifications of mayors or county magistrates to monopolize national resources. Moreover, operating mining requires extremely large capital, while county and municipal governments are endowed with administrative powers and should reasonably devote their energy and use their income to develop local public utilities, education, and health, etc., to seek the interests of the people, without surplus funds or leisure, let alone talents, to operate mining. Moreover, our country's official governance is still lacking in clarity, and under accumulated habits, malpractices are inevitable. Now, without operating mining, the county and municipal governments can, according to Article 20 of the Mining Law, stipulate that after the mining area is applied for by the people, the county and municipal governments obtain priority rights within six months. Having operated mining, the county and municipal governments can also, according to the reasons stipulated in Article 41, take the opportunity to accuse and revoke mining rights. Thus, mayors and county magistrates can not only forcibly take the people's mining rights, but also use political power to confiscate the people's mining rights. If they encounter a good mayor or county magistrate, they may not be able to stay in their position for long. If they encounter a corrupt mayor or county magistrate, they can use a piece of application, manipulate the law, to achieve their coveted private schemes, and pose unlimited threats to entrepreneurs, increase mining disputes, and hinder mining development, nothing is more serious than this. Therefore, mining priority rights, except for state-owned mineral products in Article 9 and demarcated state reserve areas in Article 10, should be based on the order of people's applications and abolish the priority rights of county and municipal governments, eliminating people's doubts, which is the most important measure for developing mining. (C) It is appropriate to broaden the time limit for people's mining operations. According to Article 16 of the Mining Law, the mining right shall not exceed 20 years. After the expiration, an application may be submitted to the Ministry of Industry for approval of extension, but the extension shall not exceed 20 years, meaning that the period of private mining operations shall not exceed 40 years at most. After this time limit, all the country's mines will be changed to state-owned. Operating mining must raise large amounts of capital. If the time limit is short, then entrepreneurs will hesitate to invest in mining, and capital will not be easy to raise. For mining operations that have already been established, for all projects, they only seek simple and quick mining, perfunctory and incomplete, without long-term plans or long-term equipment. If the mining area is very large and the reserves are very abundant, but due to time constraints, the most economical methods cannot be used to fully exploit it, and the environment is forced, and sales may not be smooth every year, by the expiration date, the natural advantages of the land will inevitably be abandoned underground, harming the source of the country's wealth and blocking the development of private mining operations. Therefore, in order to encourage entrepreneurs to invest as much as possible and fully develop, it is necessary to broaden the time limit for mining rights. (D) It is appropriate to reduce the restrictions on lessees of state-owned mining rights. According to Article 51 of the Mining Law, when state-owned mining rights are leased, the Ministry of Industry and the lessee shall stipulate the lease term and annual rent in the contract, and stipulate the annual minimum production and minimum investment amount according to the actual situation. Article 54 also stipulates that annual rent must be paid, and the obligations of paying taxes must be fulfilled in accordance with private mining operations, subject to various restrictions. Having paid rent, and then paying mining tax, is inevitable overlapping, and the annual minimum production and minimum investment depend entirely on the situation and business conditions, which cannot be predicted. Moreover, having the same restrictions as private mining operations, without any guarantee, at a time when industry and commerce are in difficulty and all industries are in decline, except for small mining operations, I am afraid it is difficult to expect people to invest in leasing under the above circumstances. If so, then if the state does not operate and the people do not operate, is it not difficult to develop mining? (2) Regardless of the type of coal mine, it should be allowed for the people to mine in accordance with the law. According to the provisions of Article 9 of the Mining Law, coking bituminous coal mines should be state-owned, the boundaries are unclear. In recent years, according to scientific explanations, the scope of coking bituminous coal is very broad. Since the invention of the low-temperature distillation method, any bituminous coal can be used to produce semi-coke. In the metallurgical industry, it can sometimes provide considerable use. In recent years, due to the development of the steel industry, coal washing equipment has been greatly improved, and coking technology has also made great progress. Not only can coking bituminous coal be made into high-quality products, but if non-coking bituminous coal is mixed with a considerable proportion of coking bituminous coal, it can also be made into good coke suitable for metallurgy. The quality depends on the nature of the coal and the composition of the mixture. Bituminous coal that was once determined to be non-coking can now be made into metallurgical coke. This is in terms of science, and it is appropriate to cancel this provision. Moreover, our country's mining industry is very young. More than 90% of iron ore is manipulated by Japanese capital, and metal ore is as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. Relatively speaking, the only one with a slight beginning is the coal mining industry. However, most of them are controlled by foreigners, and Chinese-funded mines mostly produce bituminous coal. They have been repeatedly affected by internal wars and have been devastated for a long time, on the verge of bankruptcy. It is appropriate to promote and protect them particularly. If all bituminous coal mines are completely classified as state-owned according to the above article, then private coal mines will be the victims of state-owned coal mines. At a time when the national economy is exhausted, the government feels a lack of strong capital. If foreign capital is used to operate large coal mines, I am afraid it will not be realized in a short period of time. If state-owned is not yet successful and private-owned is not allowed, it will inevitably restore the state of blocking the mining industry in the past. This is in terms of fact, and it is appropriate to immediately cancel this provision. (3) It is appropriate to unify the mineral product tax, exempt various miscellaneous taxes, and order state-owned mining operations to pay the mineral tax as well. According to Article 93 of the Mining Law, the mineral product tax should be paid at 2% to 10% according to the average price of the nearby market of the place of production. Compared with the 15 per thousand tax rate for the first category of minerals and 10 per thousand for the second category stipulated in the three mining regulations of the Republic of China, it has already increased greatly. The types of mineral products are numerous, and the tax rates vary. It is appropriate to have a large tax rate for a certain mineral product and a small tax rate for a certain mineral product. There is no clear public announcement yet. According to the Ministry of Finance's circular, all mines that pay mineral product tax in accordance with the law are exempt from business tax and various donations, except for exports that need to pay tax. All mines holding mineral product tax receipts are allowed to pass through the country and are not allowed to be taxed repeatedly. However, in fact, the provinces have their own customs. For mining merchants, not only is business tax collected, but other exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous taxes cannot be exempted. In areas far from the central government, the matter of sending funds and extorting money is often heard, and even creating various names, beautifying them as national salvation donations, and ordering the people to apportion them, which damages the credibility of the central government and hinders the development of the mining industry. Now, the mineral product tax has increased more than just a few times compared to before. Even if it is to increase the national economy, it is difficult to get special permission to reduce it. The mineral product tax rate should be clearly and clearly stipulated, and various exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous taxes should be exempted to ease the burden on the people. As for local public welfare, education, and other donations, they are all good deeds, and the people will be happy to follow if they are donated voluntarily. If they are forced to apportion, it is a warlord's behavior and should be suppressed. Moreover, state-owned mining operations, according to Article 50, have used company organizations and are allowed for private individuals and foreigners to invest in shares. They should pay taxes equally in accordance with the tax regulations of private mining operations to show fairness. (4) Formulate mining factory worker management regulations and mining industry safety regulations. In recent years, labor unrest has surged, and labor-management disputes in various mines have often been heard. Since the establishment of various mine trade unions, the welfare of workers has been increasing year by year. However, miners' knowledge is simple, and people's hearts are greedy and insatiable. All theories that harm others and benefit oneself are most easily moved. A slight dissatisfaction is prone to strikes and slowdowns. Once a disaster occurs, the mine will be shut down, and the miners will also lose their jobs. The miners' affairs were listed as a special chapter in the three mining regulations of the Republic of China. Later, the rules for the treatment of miners were promulgated. Although the current Mining Law does not specify miners, the treatment of workers in each mine has been ordered to be handled in accordance with the Factory Law. However, the current state of each mine is in a difficult autumn. Whether all treatment methods can be fully borne is not discussed for the time being. Judging from the situation of the miners, the situation of mining factories is different from other factories, and the management of workers in each mine is also different. The Factory Law was originally established to protect workers. However, according to the environment of each mine, it is not entirely in line with the facts. There is often pain that is difficult to implement. Now, let's list a few points below: (A) There is a difference between long-term workers (ie, hired workers), short-term workers (temporary workers), and contractors (ie, external workers). The circumstances of injury or death are also different. Some are those who know the danger and bravely save people or protect projects, causing injury or death. Some are those who encounter unexpected danger while working, causing injury or death. Some are those who do not obey the orders of the supervisor, neglect their duties, causing injury or death. And the length of service of long-term workers is different, and the term of short-term workers and contractors is uncertain. The methods of allowances and pensions should be handled separately according to each situation to be fair. According to Article 45 of the Factory Law, workers who are injured or die due to the performance of their duties, etc., seem to be too general and vague, not in line with the facts. (B) According to Article 49 of the Factory Law, the factory meeting is composed of an equal number of representatives elected by the factory representatives and all the workers in the factory. It is intended to resolve labor-management disputes and cooperate in production, which is a good intention. However, there are many workers in each mine, and the components are complex. There are long-term workers, short-term workers, and contractors, and contractors and short-term workers account for the majority, and they are constantly changing. How can they elect representatives? Moreover, most mining factories are in remote areas, and the miners are young, lack common sense. If you want to elect representatives to jointly design improvements with the factory, it is really difficult. If there are bad elements, they will make insatiable demands at the meeting, or interfere with the factory's administration, or attack management personnel, or cause class struggles, which will only increase disputes. Therefore, in areas where worker education has not yet been popularized and the contracting system has not yet been abolished, it seems necessary to postpone the implementation of this meeting in various mining factories. (C) Mining factory work, except for small-scale ones, is mostly continued day and night and cannot be stopped for a moment. The work cannot be stopped before the people in the next shift take over to avoid danger, which hinders production and suffers significant losses. Even during rest or vacation periods, the whole staff cannot stop work. If the factory must work as usual during rest or vacation periods due to production needs, the wages of the vacation period should be added in accordance with Article 18 of the Factory Law. However, the above situation is not stipulated in the Factory Law. From the above, it seems appropriate to formulate separate management regulations for mining factory workers based on the actual situation of the mining factory and with reference to the provisions of the Factory Law. The law is valuable in its implementation. Cutting the feet to fit the shoes is difficult to implement, and it is inevitable to fail the spirit of legislation. Now, because this law is closely related to mining laws and regulations, it is discussed in conjunction with it. In addition, mining industry safety regulations were once stipulated in the mining regulations, and the coal mine explosion prevention rules and the mining factory hookworm disease prevention rules were promulgated successively. It has been three years since the implementation of the current Mining Law. Except for the mining police, it is heard that a special chapter has been formulated. There are no above safety regulations for the time being. It seems appropriate to revise and promulgate them as soon as possible. All the essential factors related to the extraction project and equipment, and the prevention of danger, etc., should be summarized, so that the mining administration authorities can have a basis for the supervision of the mining industry, and the mining operators can have a basis for the safety of the miners. Moreover, the nature of the work of mining and smelting is completely different. The situation of coal mines, metal mines, petroleum mines, and stone mines is also different, and it is appropriate to formulate rules separately for compliance. The above are all of great importance to the rise and fall of the mining industry. I dare not remain silent. If you consider and adopt them, the prosperity of the mining industry will be a gift from Your Excellency, and the national economy and the people's livelihood will benefit greatly. Is it appropriate? I beg for your decision.</p>

<p>This week's educational seminar, held at Guanshengyuan at 3:00 PM, brought together English teachers from various middle schools, including Datong University Affiliated Middle School, Qingxin Middle School, Shanghai Municipal Wusong Middle School, Peiming Girls' Middle School, Zhengxing Girls' Middle School, Huiping Middle School, Guanghua Practical Middle School, Qiehua Middle School, Taihu Junior High School, and China Middle School, totaling sixteen schools. Eighteen English teachers, including Jiang Depei, Shen Xuechun, Zheng Yixin, Cai Yixian, Zhu Meiyu, Sun Huizhi, Rao Shu, Gao Changnan, Wu Yuanfu, Lu Zhiyun, Yang Fang, Zheng Tao, etc., shared their daily teaching experiences and difficulties, expressing many interesting opinions. Jiang Depei of Datong stated that high school English should focus on difficult words and rhetoric, assigning extracurricular readings such as essays and biographies. Junior high should use strict methods to build a basic foundation, memorizing the essential parts of the textbooks. Emphasis should also be placed on beginner grammar. Sun Huizhi of Zhengxing Girls' Middle School stated that learning English is nothing more than (1) understanding what is heard, (2) recognizing what is read, (3) speaking understandably, and (4) writing clearly. She also emphasized instilling in students the virtues of English and Americans, seeking practicality and stability, rather than fostering bad habits of English obsession. Shen Xuechun of Qingxin stated that to improve students' English, organizing speech clubs and study groups is important, and foreign guests should be invited to speak to high school students. Zheng Yixin of Songzhong stated that incorrect English pronunciation is a major problem, and many current English teachers may also have inaccurate pronunciation, leading to misunderstandings during conversation. Therefore, emphasis should be placed on correct pronunciation from the beginning of English teaching. Cai Yixian of Peiming Girls' Middle School stated that the uneven level of students in each grade makes teaching difficult, and students with poor performance must be given separate remedial instruction. Zheng Tao, Gao Changnan, Dai Shunren, and others also expressed their opinions, but details are omitted due to length. Finally, the Northern New Book Company presented a full set of middle school English reading texts and grammar books, requesting corrections and suggestions.</p>

<h3>Zhou Xianyan, the "Iron Gate," to Go to the United States at the End of the Month</h3>
<p>▲ Internship at Santa Fe Railway ▲ Expected Return in December Next Year</p>
<p>Zhou Xianyan, a renowned football player known as the "Iron Gate," graduated from Shanghai Jiaotong University in 1928. He was assigned to intern at the Traffic Department of the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways. In the winter of 1931, he was appointed as a staff member of the Business Section (formerly known as the Commercial Section). When the two railways' business office opened in August of this year, he was transferred to the office as a clerk, responsible for inquiry work. Now, to further his studies, he contacted Mr. An Qi'er, the deputy manager of the American Santa Fe Railway Company, and obtained permission to intern at the railway. Mr. An will be responsible for guiding everything. All round-trip tickets from San Francisco to Chicago will be issued by the railway. Mr. Zhou, considering this a rare opportunity, plans to depart at the end of this year, aiming to return to China after completing his internship in December next year. Therefore, he is preparing funds and, in accordance with departmental regulations, preparing a certificate of qualifications and a list of subjects to be studied, requesting that his original position and salary be retained during his internship in the United States. This has now been approved by the Ministry of Railways.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>If People Could Not Die</h3>
<p>— Yong Zi</p>
<p>If people could live through old age and illness without dying, even if a sharp blade crossed their necks, they could, like Sun Wukong, have their heads cut off and then grow another one from their chest. Then, I think this world would be hundreds of times more fun than it is now.</p>
<p>A hero who lived a lifetime cannot avoid being buried under a mound of yellow earth after death. Even a hero who does not care for children's affections cannot avoid being disheartened. If people could not die, then every hero could create a situation. Fortunately, the common people, who are not included in the ranks of heroes, are not in danger of losing their lives under five hundred-pound bombs, so they do not have to worry about sacrifice and can sleep peacefully or sit high up, widening their eyes to watch the fight, cheering for the heroes who create the situation.</p>
<p>Patriotic young people with good intentions but no way to save the country often jump into the sea with photos of lost lovers, or, with lovers in passionate embrace, close the doors of hotel rooms and swallow sleeping pills. In this era, when the Bodhisattva Guanyin has not yet achieved universal salvation, young people with a surge of righteous indignation have no way to volunteer their services, and the only way out is to end their lives. But if humans could truly not die, the path of suicide would be blocked. Then, wouldn't keeping these passionate young people in the world make it even livelier?</p>
<p>People still cannot escape the line of death. According to folk legends, they cannot escape the grasp of the impartial King Yama after death. So this gives a major blow to those who are brave enough to do evil, and they dare not fail to leave some food for their grandchildren to eat. If the word "death" did not exist in the dictionary of life, then everyone could boldly engage in scheming, deception, and all kinds of heinous acts. Who knows what kind of situation this world would have progressed to?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the people created by God are all destined to die, so what is said above is actually nonsense. But even though it is nonsense, the nonsense must be said. If people could not die, then heroes would create situations without risking their lives, villains would commit all kinds of evil, and the common people would be unable to seek death and would feel even more pitiful. Passionate young people would not sink when they jump into the sea, would not die when they swallow pills, and would live with a belly full of resentment, which would also be boring. Therefore, it is better for people to die.</p>
<h3>Song of the Ferry Landing</h3>
<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>The river is the world; the cabin is my home. Rocking, rocking, in an instant the plum blossoms bloom. Blossoms bloom, blossoms fall, blossoms bear fruit, when will the ferry girl find someone to marry? Rocking, rocking, I cry out for my mother! Her daughter has grown so tall – and so big! … On the riverbank, it is the beginning of winter. Yet it is still so warm, like a little spring in October, with a gentle southern breeze blowing. Several ferries are docked at the landing, and the ferry girl leans on her oar, singing pensively. But, she stops again, raises her head to look at the sky, where clusters of cotton-like white clouds are being pushed along. A flock of geese, flying in a formation like the Chinese characters for "人" (person) and "一" (one), crosses the sky, becoming smaller and more distant, like black sesame seeds – vanishing.</p>
<p>Vanished, like precious youth.</p>
<p>The geese will fly back again next spring.</p>
<p>Youth, ah, it is gone and never returns.</p>
<p>Look at the couples everywhere, while I remain alone. I really can't understand my mother's intentions. Could it be that she wants me to stay on the boat for life as a ferry girl? Other girls have such good fortune. Married off at such a young age.</p>
<p>Thinking this, depression and frustration fill her heart, and she feels a stinging heat, with two red clouds flying to her cheeks – .</p>
<p>Red clouds, on the horizon where the water meets the sky. The glow of the evening sunset. Before she knows it, it's dusk again, and she sees the birds returning to their nests in pairs. The silver-gray surface of the river is wrinkled by the southern wind. The ferry is already carrying travelers from afar – lonely wanderers who have weathered many storms – across the river. For the sake of life, everyone is: everyone is... On the stern of the boat, she sings softly again.</p>
<h3>Xi Shi and the Vase</h3>
<p>— Yan Bоguang</p>
<p>In old novels, the descriptions of "a face that would make fish sink and geese fall, a countenance that would shame the moon and humiliate the flowers" always bring to mind Xi Shi, Zhaojun, Diaochan, and Guifei, the unparalleled beauties of ancient times.</p>
<p>But the modern standard of Eastern beauty, Ms. Xu Lai, certainly has a pretty face, but looking at her pictures, it seems that the silver screen star Ruan Lingyu is even more attractive. Perhaps it is her artistic movements and posture on the screen that have won over my aesthetic sense. Indeed, when I was in Suzhou and Ruan Lingyu's films were showing, I always spent some time to go see them, and I even bought a photo from the brothers' company on Guanqian Street and brought it home. When my wife, Qifen, saw it, she asked me who the person in the photo was. I replied that it was the silver screen star Ruan Lingyu, but she did not believe me until I showed her a newspaper to verify it. Several colleagues call Ruan Lingyu the "Movie Xi Shi." In Suzhou, there are too many "Xi Shi!" Any woman who is even slightly attractive is praised as a "Xi Shi," such as "Beef Xi Shi," "Spare Ribs Xi Shi," "Coal Xi Shi," "Tofu Xi Shi,"... Because of these "Xi Shi," I always go to distinguish their true faces every Sunday. I feel that calling a woman a "Xi Shi" is an insult to women. Otherwise, how could Xi Shi be casually named?</p>
<p>Vases are decorations, just for embellishment. Calling a woman a "vase" is also an insult to women, as if a woman's work skills are weak and she can only be a vase to be looked at. Then aren't there also useless people in government offices? Only men are seen calling women "vases," and women are not seen calling men "rice buckets." Is this gender inequality?</p>

<h3>Four Northeast Company Commanders</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 20: Divining a Favorable Date, the Old Man Laughs Daily; Endless Worry Erased, Old Friends Live Across the Street</p>
<p>Seeing the situation, Mrs. Jiang was sure that he was asleep, so she no longer bothered to ask. She reached under the pillow to explore and see what was there. Her hand felt something unusual, so she grabbed it and pulled it out completely. Seeing that Guizhi was still fast asleep, she quietly took long strides and walked to the outer room. Looking at the thing in her hand, it was a picture-story book, a few scraps of paper, and a photograph. The half-length portrait in the photo was clearly recognizable as Second Master Gan. The person in the picture looked even younger, but the paper had turned yellow, so this was clearly not a recent photo. Mrs. Jiang thought to herself, "I didn't expect this girl to still be thinking about that Gan fellow. I don't know if this photo was given to her before or now. If it was given to her before, that's fine, but if it was given to her now, what would happen if the Zhao family found out? It would be terrible!" As she thought this, she held the photo in her hand and stared at it, lost in thought. After a long time, she found a saying in the vernacular to solve the problem, which was that a daughter cannot be kept when she grows up. Looking at the situation, her husband is away in the army, and her sweetheart, although they don't meet often, lives right across the street. She shouldn't be careless and cause any trouble. Thinking this, she stuffed the photo and books back under the pillow. She acted as usual towards Guizhi, pretending not to know anything. The next day, she went to the backyard to chat with Elder Zhao and, talking about this and that, the conversation turned to Zhao Ziqiang. Mrs. Jiang said, "Old Master, upon careful consideration, I think this marriage should not be delayed any longer. I think you can write a letter to Ziqiang to discuss it with him. If he can spare the time, let him take two weeks of leave during this neither cold nor hot season and come back to take care of this happy event. What do you think, Old Master?" (265)</p>

<h3>Business News 金融 (Finance) 金市過程 (Gold Market Process) 掙扎於七百元關口 (Struggling at the 700 Yuan Mark) ＝美銀匯兌物價俱升＝ (＝US Bank Exchange Rates and Prices All Rise＝) ＝一天結果回落七元＝ (＝One Day's Result is a Fall of Seven Yuan＝)</h3>
<p>The gold market fell yesterday, but the market situation for the day was stable, struggling at the 700 yuan mark. In the early morning, overseas silver markets saw the US dollar falling and rising, and the Five Metals Exchange's forward silver prices rose by four cents and three and a half cents, respectively. Exchange rates rose uniformly. London spot gold fell three pence, and the US government's purchase price for mined gold was still calculated at $35.01. US wheat rose by 2.375 cents, US cotton rose by ten points, and stocks rose by $1.88. The opening price of the wool market was initially quoted at 700.12 yuan, then lowered to around 700 yuan. After opening, it immediately broke through the 700 yuan mark, but because the posted US exchange rate only rose by 0.125, people's hearts were still calm, and there was much struggling. Later, the domestic market tightened. Reuters reported that US Senator Mike Mansfield declared that he was not pressuring the government to adopt aggressive monetary expansion in the next Congress, but was instead seeking a new exchange rate and gold price. Although it did not have much impact, the gold market was firm. The later market opened quite steadily, but because people were feeling uncertain, Chinese merchants continued to sell US dollars, and Shanghai banks sold notes, briefly breaking through the 700 yuan mark, but remaining stable afterward. The market situation was generally stable for the day, with everyone mostly waiting and seeing. The black market price was 1,075 yuan. Now, the day's market situation will be reviewed hour by hour.</p>
<p>The morning opened at 700.005 yuan, down 8.3 yuan from last Saturday. Goods opened at 699.8 yuan. The exchange market opened with the near-term selling price of British pounds at one shilling and three and a half pence, and US dollars at 33.6875 yuan. Yuan Mao, Hengtai, Zhifeng, and Yonglai were selling, and the price retreated from 0.9 yuan to 699.2 yuan. However, because Chengjin Taiwan had previously purchased April US dollars at 875, there were frequent rebounds at this time. Zhejiang sold March US dollars at 625, and the price fell from 0.6 yuan to within 699 yuan. Shanghai purchased March US dollars at 6875, but Hengyu and Dadecheng sold notes to protect the rise, and the price still fell from 0.5 yuan to 698.3 yuan. After the opening, Yuanfeng, Yongzhao, and Fengjing took notes on the market, and the market situation was uncertain. It was expected that HSBC's posted British pound rate would be flat and the US dollar rate would only rise by 0.125, so the situation was still considered good. Yuan Mao and Yongyou had some selling, so there was much hovering. By the time Shanghai purchased April at 35 yuan and March at 6875, Fuchang, Ruikang, Hengchang, and Yongxing sold notes, and the price rose to above 700 yuan. Yuansheng, Yongda, and Kanggeng even reached 0.01 yuan. Shanghai sold March US dollars at 625, and Hengyu supplied goods, retreating to 700 yuan. After the opening, the situation was calm, without much up or down movement. Without anything happening, there were slight news flashes. HSBC purchased March US dollars at 625, Zhifeng, Yongyuan, Yongfu, Yu and others reached 0.018 yuan, Yongfeng, Tongtai, and Chang sold notes together. After much fluctuation, the noon closing was 701.6 yuan, and goods were traded at the same price.</p>
<p>The after-market opened at 702 yuan, and goods opened at 701.7 yuan. Hengxing, Yuanmao, Yongheng, and Yu sold, and the price fell to 0.01 yuan, but because Chengjin was still purchasing April US dollars at 875, the price rebounded by nearly 1 yuan. However, Dakang and Hengyu still had supplies, so the price broke through the 700 yuan mark and retreated to 695.5 yuan. Bingxing took notes on the market at low prices, and the situation was still stable. Fuyu also purchased, and the price gradually rebounded. HSBC purchased April US dollars at 9375, and banks still wanted them. Yuanmao advanced to 1.5 yuan. Chengjin also purchased April US dollars at 875. Hengxing and Hengyu took the opportunity to sell at high prices, and the price fell again to 0.02 yuan. McGalligary purchased March US dollars at 625, and Hengtai, Yuanfeng, Yong and others bought in. Goods also rose, and the closing price rose again to 701.8 yuan. Goods were traded at 702.2 yuan, and the price finally hovered around 1.5 yuan. The highest price for the day was 702 yuan, and the lowest price was 698.3 yuan, with a fluctuation of 3.7 yuan. The result was a decrease of 7 yuan compared to last Saturday.</p>
<p>The announced price was 719 yuan due to HSBC Bank's US dollar exchange rate rising by 0.125 to 33.375 yuan, which matched the standard gold price. According to the closing price, the discount was approximately 17 yuan, which was 4 yuan more than last Saturday. The registered price for this month was 708 yuan, and for January it was 702 yuan. The morning top-up price was 708 yuan, and the afternoon top-up price was the same. The black market price was 1,075 yuan. There were few transactions within the market, and the market situation was uncertain. Initially, the Tianjin bank sold 300 taels to Panfengheng for 1,078 yuan. Then, Yingfenghheng sold 300 taels to the Tianjin bank for 1,077 yuan. The after-market was even quieter. There were still 4,438 notes remaining for this month.</p>
<p>Transactions within the market were flat. In summary, Shunli, Wanxing, Ruikang, Zhifeng, Yong, Yongfeng, Xianghe, Dafayong, Dakang, Fuchang, Neixing, Qingfa, Yuanyuan, and Chundeng were on the buying side, while Hengtai, Daxing, Yongyuan, Mao, Dadecheng, Qianchang, Xiangfutai, Hengfuyu, Tongchun, and Hengxing were on the selling side. Hengyu, Yuanxing, Yongyongde, and Hengxing entered and exited in advance. The Dalian bank, Shunli, made a total of 1,900, and the scenery was squeezed into more than 400. Wanxing made a total of more than 1,600, and the scenery was squeezed into more than 200. The Guangdong bank, Hengxing, entered more than 100 and exited more than 400. The total number of chips for January was 33,754.</p>

After the announcement, the process turned flat. At noon, the market tightened again due to the bank's continued appetite.

The transaction in the midday market was more than 600,000, and the transaction in the small general meeting was 300,000.

<h3>Sad Events</h3>
<p>— Shuicao</p>
<p>Waking up from a dream in the early morning; lying in bed, listening to the sound of the autumn wind mixed with fine rain hitting the glass window; the weather is very gloomy, the room is quiet, my body crouches under a thin quilt, my eyes are watching the top of the tent; my heart is thinking about some indelible past events, and the memory is like a pastoral song blown from a distance in the evening wind, gently blowing into people's hearts. So I have to slowly review it. My heart is very melancholy, although I won't be sad enough to shed tears, but I am already desolate enough!</p>
<p>I remember last year at Uncle Lu Xiang's place, when Miss Quan was also there: one clear spring afternoon, Miss Quan and I leaned against the window looking at the outside scenery. Grass and flowers bloomed all over the fields; rape flowers were like gold, and butterflies and bees were drilling into the gold. Miss Quan was very kind to me, peeling white cabbage and laughing into my mouth. My hand rested on Miss Quan's shoulder, gently patting; Miss Quan often glanced sideways, with a smile on her lips, and her hair was messy on her forehead; what a cute and beautiful girl!</p>
<p>(Miss Quan, you are like a butterfly, lively enough; I love butterflies the most!) I looked into the distance and said softly to Miss Quan.</p>
<p>(Then you have to love me!) Quan squinted at me, smiling slightly; her eyebrows were very thin and long and changeable.</p>
<p>(Love you, but what about you; do you really love me?)</p>
<p>(I loved you when you first came to my house!) she lowered her head and smiled. Suddenly, Miss Quan turned her body around and put her hands on my shoulders; (Xi, are you going back tomorrow? Can't you stay one more day?) A gourd-shaped face was pressed against my shirt; her eyes fixed on me, shaking her body and asking.</p>
<p>(Stay one more day? Okay! But my mother is waiting!) Actually, I also wanted to stay one more day, leaving a lovely girl, and boarding the ship alone; listening to the sound of the water alone, the taste was strangely uncomfortable. (But what about after tomorrow? We still have to say goodbye the day after tomorrow!) My heart was very dark, and I was very grateful for Miss Quan's kindness to me. But one separation would be for several months!</p>
<p>(Don't talk about separation, talking about it will make you bored! But what are your plans for the second half of the year, Xi?) She raised her left hand and twisted my face, asking eagerly. (Go to university! Quan, when can we live together?) I said.</p>
<p>(Four years, after you graduate!) Miss Quan smiled.</p>
<p>(Four years, a long time! Girls are prone to change their minds!) (Hum, it's good if you don't change your mind! My heart has already been taken away by you, who else can occupy my heart,) Miss Quan lowered her head. A black tie was fluttering in the breeze on her hair.</p>
<p>(Then, good. May God bless us to succeed!) Looking at the sky, the sky was very high, and in the distance, one or two white clouds were gently flying to who knows where.</p>
<p>(May God bless us to succeed!)</p>
<p>I turned Miss Quan's body around with both hands and held her face; a very cute little nose, red lips, and very charming white teeth! A slight smile; I lowered my head and gave a kiss that was forever engraved in my heart!</p>
<p>The moon wanes and waxes, and it has been almost a year since I saw Miss Quan. During this year, my heart has wavered once; but I will never forget Miss Quan's kindness to me in this unfortunate encounter!</p>
<p>In the rainy night dusk, in the gentle breeze of the morning; when a person is sitting blankly recalling some past events, the first thing that crawls into memory is Miss Quan! The autumn wind secretly blows past the pillow, telling the autumn wind: my old friend is well, may Miss Quan try to eat more!</p>
<h3>Securities and Public Bonds Exhibit a Weak and Fluctuating Trend</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange and the market in general showed a downward fluctuating trend. Each session had its ups and downs, ultimately resulting in a greater number of large investors selling than buying, leading to a gradual decline. The current situation has not shown significant development, but it has been brewing for some time. Neither war nor peace has a clear direction. However, the situation in Fujian and Zhejiang is becoming increasingly tense, with the atmosphere of war permeating, and it has become acute. Whether political maneuvers can extinguish the disaster in Fujian, success or failure will be determined in these few days. The securities market is in a precarious state. People are afraid of the last sharp decline, and investors are becoming more cautious. Therefore, the market shows a slight fluctuation amidst the weakness. Yesterday morning, the Customs 1918 bonds suddenly rose by $1.20, and the Reorganization and Troop Reduction bonds also rose by $0.40 or $0.50. Since the launch of the forward-dated troop reduction bonds, large investors have been selling, gradually showing signs of weakness. After that, people became uncertain and collectively fell back, losing $0.30 to $0.50, or even $1.00 or more. In the second session, the Reorganization and Troop Reduction bonds followed the downward trend of the first session, falling back by $0.60 or $0.70, while other bonds became firm from being stable, rising by $0.30 or $0.50. The ups and downs were inconsistent, as if in a state of fluctuation. In the afternoon, large investors continued to sell. Only the Reorganization and Troop Reduction bonds felt relatively stable and firm, while the rest fell due to oversupply, dropping by $0.20 or $0.30 to $1.00. The closing price generally fell by $0.20 to $1.30 or $1.40. This month's salt tax bonds plummeted by $1.65, while the Customs 1918 bonds rose by $1.20. The total transaction volume was $18,700,500. There were no spot transactions. The total futures transactions, including salt tax bonds, were $7,400,000. Troop reduction bonds accounted for $3,420,000, the Customs 1919 bonds accounted for $1,720,000, and the 20th issue of Customs bonds accounted for $2,845,000. The rest ranged from tens of thousands to over one million. The exchange announced that due to the busy trading in recent days, only one session will be held in the afternoon, extending it for one week until the 16th. The theory of inflation has been revived.</p>
<h3>New York Stock Market Has the Potential to Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>Sinfon Company reported that the New York stock market on the 9th opened calmly, then rose sharply by about three dollars, and finally eased slightly. This was due to good commercial news, the weakness of the U.S. dollar, and the merger plan between Western Union Telegraph Company and Postal Telegraph Company, which made transportation stocks exceptionally active. Moreover, the rumor of inflation has been revived, and the market seems likely to continue to rise. Half-day trading volume was 1,070,210 shares. The U.S. Steel Corporation exported a total of 430,358 tons of steel in November, a decrease of 142,539 tons compared to October. (Wheat) rose due to speculative buying by Liverpool reporters and strong coarse grains. (Cotton) The successful issuance of short-term treasury bills by the Treasury Department, the reduction of debates on gold purchase policies, and commercial progress all helped to improve market sentiment. Factories also bought in. The price of gold purchased by the Financial Aftermath Society was 34.01 yuan per tael, unchanged. The Dow Jones index is listed below:</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Futures See Bullish Profit-Taking</h3>
<p>The yarn market is declining and the situation is softening, as speculators are taking profits. At the same time, spot sales remain sluggish. The situation is chaotic and the New Year holidays are approaching, credit is tight, and there is little hope for a large increase in yarn sales. On the whole, the market is still flat, but the base is not as high as it was a few days ago.</p>
<h3>Human Futures Softening</h3>
<p>The human futures market opened with bullish selling and fewer buyers, and the market turned down. Prices for all months fell by $1.40, $0.60 or $0.80 to $2.10.

<h3>Cotton Futures in Buyer's Struggle</h3>
<p>The cotton market fell in the morning and rose in the afternoon. U.S. cotton rose slightly, and the exchange rate also increased. There was not much change in the silver market calculation, and buyers were still struggling to purchase as much as possible, so the market rebounded as soon as it fell. Spot cotton sales were extremely quiet. According to another report, there is sufficient cotton inventory in Hankou, and prices are flat. Cotton cloth is still difficult to improve due to the low price of yarn.</p>

<h3>Review of the Bombay Cotton Market Last Week</h3>
<p>Market prices were largely unchanged last week. The India-Japan conference has received considerable attention, and it is generally believed that a solution is not far off, as the disputes between the two governments are approaching. European merchants are selling short, but they are being absorbed by market speculators. Deliveries are gradually increasing. On the spot side, in addition to purchases by Indian merchants, local manufacturers are also inquiring. European transactions are insignificant. China has slightly increased its appetite.

<h3>Grain Futures Show Erratic Fluctuations</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market opened with initial stability, followed by weakness in each month. The price of foreign wheat rose by about 7 cents in Chicago and 2 cents in Canada. Therefore, after the opening price, the market in each month was still stable. However, after the second session, due to the continuous selling of foreign wheat, the asking price was still only $3.90. As a result, some factories disposed of their holdings at any time, and the forward market was uniformly downward, falling by about 1 to 2 cents compared to the initial opening. When the afternoon session opened, market sentiment was not good, and it was rumored that two ships of Russian wheat had been pre-sold at very low prices, causing the market to be unbearably weak. Later, due to a change in the tariff on foreign wheat, a small factory and traders from Tianjin jointly covered their short positions, so the forward market rebounded immediately. Currently, the market is fluctuating due to rumors about the situation, tariffs, or foreign wheat, and there are few accurate views. As a result, the current month was still down by 1 cent, January was up by 1.5 li, February was up by 2.5 li, March was up by 1 cent, April was up by 7.5 li, and May was up by 2.5 li.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures Still Affected by Selling of Foreign Wheat</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market showed stability in each month after opening in the morning. Although the price of foreign wheat also rebounded by about 2 to 7 cents, the market was weak due to the lack of buying interest and the continuous selling of spot foreign wheat, so people were inevitably wary. When the afternoon session opened, trading had become smoother and the market had softened. Because the flour market was down in the morning and the asking price for spot foreign wheat was still $3.90, the market became weaker as buying increased. As a result, the current month was unchanged, January was down 1 cent, February was down 2 cents, March was down 3 cents, and April was down 4 cents. The spot wheat market was weak due to the soft standard and flat factory appetite, so the asking price has also fallen by 3 to 5 cents. Kainan Suzhou was at $4.27, Yaowan wheat was at $4.24, Daliji wheat was at $4.27, and Bengbu wheat was at $4.25, totaling 1,500 bags.</p>
<h3>Late Rice Arrivals Decrease, Market Tightens</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) The source is slightly scarce. The late rice of various groups arrives on the boat head of the 20th (about 3,000 dan), thick japonica and Doyang tip are about 20-30 (4,000 dan), totaling about 40-50 ships. Since the previous market, the rice market seemed to be chaotic. Yesterday's opening still had aftereffects. The dealers believed that there were not many cargoes in the daily letters, and in this case, there was no difference between good and bad, and those with high-quality goods would lose too much. Therefore, they tried to inspect the goods and the market began to clear up. At that time, Tangshan purchased 1,000 bags, and Qingdao, Yantai, and other groups added more than 2,000 bags. Sellers called for higher prices, and the situation seemed to tighten. As a result, the market price slightly increased by 5 cents. The shops in this street had the same appetite as before. As the arrivals were scarcer, the market stabilized. The thick japonica and Doyang tip from Changbang, Sutong, and Nangang all had no glory or shame, and only the silver yuan was slightly soft.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) 56-57 ships arrived from various routes. The goods in the market were still flowing. Except for the white japonica, white yuan, and thin rice prices which were slightly lower, the other rice prices were soft. The broken japonica remained stable.</p>
<h3>Customer Indica Sells Well, Price Increases</h3>
<p>▲The theft is very greedy... This street is also active. Yesterday, the guest indica and the local office rice were both active. The average volume was the actual sales appetite. The market continued to be brisk and the price increased. The囤戶 also had an appetite, because they saw that the real sales of the local customers were smooth, so they did not compete. If there are再有囤買 competing, the market will still have to climb. Yesterday, the high-quality goods have been built up to 6-7 points, and the medium-quality goods are also standing firm. The whole city was handled by this street to Jiangxi Machine Rice 800 bags, the price was 7 yuan and 5 and a half cents, the second to 7 yuan and 3 cents, Hunan Machine oil 300 bags, the price was 7 yuan and 6 cents, the second to 7 yuan and 1 cent and 7 points, and the Machine Jing 700 bags, the price was 7 yuan and 2 cents and 8 points, the second to 6 yuan and 6 and a half cents, Wuhu Yuan Rice 100 bags, the price was 7 yuan and 2 cents and a half.

The market's heart is still hoping for good. Yesterday, 700 bags of Hunan rough rice were handled, 800 bags of rough Jing rice, 200 bags of machine red, 658 bags of rough red rice, 300 bags of Shashi rough rice, 300 bags of Nanjing rough rice, and 200 bags of machine rice.

The factories have each watched to the rising price on the middle and upper goods caused by 囤户, and the cargo owners have also called tight, and the lower and middle goods. Yesterday, the total transaction volume of each soybean was about 8-9 cars, and the market price was stable.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: High Sliced Green Increases by 6 Jiao</h3>

<h3>North-South Goods: Dried Longan Pulp, New and Old Goods Entangled</h3>
<p>Shima Dried Longan Pulp has recently been sluggish in sales, and land prices have fallen repeatedly. According to reports, the price has fallen by about 10 yuan before and after the letter. Because the goods stored in the Shen market have not been opened, and the firm has self-managed goods, it is more difficult to sell. The old goods have not been exchanged, and the trend is not optimistic.</p>
<h3>Woolen Fabrics Still Thriving in This Street</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the woolen fabric trading in this street was still very prosperous. Huate Woolen Fabric Zhigong, Pighou, Maildeng, Colored Zigong, Pullover Woolen Fabric, Hanling 躉 Breeches, Overcoat Sleeve裏 Ma Zong, etc. are all being opened, but most of them are scattered.

Japanese goods, thin flannel 嗶嘰, Breeches 色子貢, also throw out many. The men’s wear retail stores are especially better, and the shoe fabric overcoat workshops are slightly less.</p>
<h3>Hardware Co. Iron Prices Rise, Garden Lead Wire Falls Back</h3>
<p>Recently, customers from new factory have added to the inventory of Hardware Co. Iron, so the transactions have been quite lively. However, there is a shortage of arrivals and limited inventory. In addition, the price of arrivals has increased, so the local market is good. The market has gradually increased and the market price is estimated to be 30 yuan (old steel factory) and 29 yuan (new steel factory), which are both 1 yuan and 5 jiao higher than before. Yesterday’s transactions reached 340-50 cases, and there were also 2-300 cases still being negotiated. Overall, the situation in the city is very good.</p>
<p>Since the military authorities collected Garden Lead Wire, the market goods were in short supply, so the standard price rose to 5 yuan. Yesterday, more than 1,000 new bundles arrived, and there was no need to worry about stockouts. The asking price was more relaxed than before because the arrivals were said to be faster.</p>
<h3>Silk Tea Overseas, Japanese Silk Dumping Still Strong</h3>
<p>▲Lyon Factory Price Difficult to Stand: Lyon Market, Japanese Silk Dumping Still Strong. Various silk weaving factories are greedy for the cheap price of Japanese silk, so they abandon Chinese silk and turn to Japanese silk, so the price of Chinese silk is difficult to stand. The local Xinfu 洋行 received a telegram from the Lyon silk market yesterday. B-grade white factory warp Sans Tiaowu Yuetu and other brands only opened 70 francs per kilogram, which also fell by 1 franc and 25 cents, and the combined Chinese currency was about 10 yuan less per bale, only about 630 yuan.</p>

<p>▲Yellow and White Factory Warp Continue to be Calm: Yesterday, the local 洋庄 Silk Market continued to be calm. New York was on holiday, and there was no silk telegram to Shanghai. The Japanese silk dumping in the British and French markets did not stop. Yellow and White Factory Warp only had silk transactions, and the price was difficult to rise. Yesterday, only Xinfu and others purchased 20 bales of white factory warp and 10 bales of yellow factory warp, and the price remained stable.</p>

<h3>On the Interests of Industrially Backward Countries</h3>
<p>— Yu Dafu</p>
<p>In the past two or three years, the waves of the world economic panic have swept the globe; the reason, of course, is overproduction. After the Great European War, the national economies of various countries were not prosperous, the general purchasing power disappeared, and as a result of the international compensation and repayment, capital was accumulating and could not circulate. The end of the panic naturally led to the problem of unemployment, the problem of political and social unrest, and the problem of more intense international market competition.</p>
<p>However, because China's industry is backward, the impact of the world economic panic has not been significant, so some commentators are praising the benefits of our China's industrial backwardness.</p>
<p>First, speaking of unemployment, there are not many workers among China's 400 million compatriots. Except for the industrial laborers in a few metropolises, most of the strong men take being a soldier as their profession. Originally unemployed, there is no way to lose it. Recently, new soldiers are being recruited everywhere, so the unemployment problem is easy to solve in China.</p>
<p>Second, speaking of political and social unrest, China has not been peaceful for more than 20 years, so the common people really cannot distinguish what a stable state is and what an unstable state is.</p>
<p>Third, there has never been such a thing as international market competition in China. We are still too busy among ourselves to take it all, so what do we care about international or not?</p>
<p>There are some benefits to being industrially backward. Finally, there is a great benefit, that is, the Chinese people take advantage of this period of world panic to get an opportunity to buy cheap foreign goods; not only is it cheaper for buyers, but also for sellers, as long as they print and paste a Chinese trademark, they can immediately manufacture many domestic products that are the same as foreign goods, isn't that great, isn't that painful!</p>
<h3>Xiao Lezi's Cricket</h3>
<p>— Huan Ming</p>
<p>(This is a centipede changed!)</p>
<p>Xiao Lezi's red-headed cricket soon became famous. As the days went by, even the owner, Side, heard the words (Red-Headed General). The owner also raised crickets, and he took the cricket jar to the city to gamble and win or lose every two or three days. When he came back, if he didn't bring back some wine and dishes, he would have to find something to spray white foam and spit out some curses. Even if he didn't say a word, you could see from his long face that his cricket had been defeated today, and he had lost money.</p>
<p>(...... Has the cattle been fed enough - you must not have fed it enough, lazy, give me that cricket to see.)</p>
<p>Xiao Lezi carefully brought out the (Red-Headed General) kept in the cigarette can. He didn't know what was going on, his heart was beating fast.</p>
<p>When the owner saw the cigarette can, his face slowly turned dark: (Taking such good cigarettes to raise crickets - hum, how daring!)</p>
<p>Fortunately, when the owner's eyes turned to the cricket, his face quickly turned into spring. He used a golden yellow thick cricket grass to flick the little bug twice, and a smile crawled across his face. Xiao Lezi stood aside biting his index finger and smiled timidly.</p>
<p>(Fight! Fight!) Side whispered to himself, carefully driving the (Red-Headed General) into the cricket room and moving it to the fighting can. Xiao Lezi stretched his neck and quietly approached. (Go away!)</p>
<p>So Xiao Lezi began to worry.</p>
<p>Until the evening, the (Red-Headed General) had not been returned to him. Xiao Lezi timidly paid attention to the owner's face for two days: the owner stroked his chin, or dug his nose with his index finger, or tied his hands behind his back and paced back and forth on the (black brick floor) in the hall, leisurely. (Hum!) His eyes suddenly flashed fiercely on Lezi's face: (Always ghostly, like some crow, except for herding cattle, it seems like nothing else is your business - go and sharpen a load of grass mud)!</p>
<p>In the afternoon, two guests carrying cricket jars came. In the hall, they carefully weighed each cricket. Next to two piles of money, the crickets fought. Side won: he sat at the round table slowly drinking wine, his legs under the table shaking non-stop like he had (shaking palsy), took a bite of dried tofu, looked at the cricket jar on the side of the table and smiled to himself.</p>
<p>Xiao Lezi walked up to the owner like a shadow, hastily averted his gaze: (My cricket...) his voice trembled.</p>
<p>Side was slightly stunned and said: (What are children doing raising crickets?)</p>
<p>Xiao Lezi trembled his lips and lowered his head to bite the corner of his clothes.</p>
<p>(Take those two shovels behind the door and sharpen them.)</p>
<p>Xiao Lezi was still paralyzed and silent.</p>
<p>(Here, dried tofu!) The owner gave Xiao Yaozi half a piece of dried tofu in a majestic and gentle manner! (Go, quickly take those two shovels to the pond to sharpen them quickly!)</p>
<p>He timidly took half a piece of dried tofu, took the shovel, and walked towards the pond in a desolate manner. (Red-Headed General!) Thinking of this, a choking force made his trachea twitch, and Xiao Lezi finally spit out a small piece of dried tofu that he hadn't chewed: he began to sob at the shadow in the pond.</p>
<h3>On (The Recognition of Reality) and (The Expression of Art) (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Shi Heng</p>
<p>Mr. Xu even more fragmentarily and inevitably somewhat distortedly quoted my remarks about "Fathers and Sons" — ("(1. 'Fathers and Sons'), with its profound recognition of reality," with its correct artistic expression, allowed this prototype to gradually grow, and Russian society eventually produced the type of person of Bazarov...") — and then argued: ("This simply turns Turgenev into a god, as if his artistic creative power caused the appearance of Bazarov in Russian society!") In this case, his argument has diverged from mine. I was talking about the effect of the social influence of the artwork "Fathers and Sons," while he was still talking about the function of the artistic part within the art. Since I acknowledged Bazarov as a "prototype of a new era," I can understand that "this prototype already exists in reality." Since I said that Turgenev had profound insight, I can also clearly see that "existence precedes thought." If the prototype was not taken from reality, then where did it come from? If existence does not precede thought, how could Turgenev use his profound insight? But to therefore say that the artwork "Fathers and Sons" has no relationship with the social development of the "prototype" it expresses, and that its growth is entirely "due to objective social conditions," is equivalent to the words of someone who, while talking about art, fundamentally negates it. Of course, the principle that objective social conditions produce people of the era cannot be denied. However, in the case of Bazarov, Mr. Xu has forgotten the norms that art gives to the future development of the social type it expresses. Moreover, when Turgenev took this prototype from reality and gave it expression, while we cannot deny its already social existence, it is also an undeniable fact, judging from the social reaction at the time of the book's publication, that its existence lacked a clear awareness of social development. But who made this prototype gain a clear awareness of social development, clearly demand the right to social existence, not die young in the prototype stage, and eventually become an actual Bazarov? Can we say that the book "Fathers and Sons" has nothing to do with the social development of this type of person? Kropotkin's report when discussing this book was not deceptive — "Reality made Turgenev write this book, and this book further expanded its influence on society." But Turgenev, the artist who was able to take the prototype from the reality that had not yet gained a clear awareness of social development one step ahead of others, and who prescribed clear norms for the social development of this prototype, was indeed playing the role of a prophet. Is there anything "laughable" about this? Not only was Turgenev, who wrote "Fathers and Sons," a prophet, but Artsybashev, who wrote "Sanin," was also a prophet, although the latter was an inaccurate one. It is not that I intentionally want to "add the title of prophet to Turgenev (or other Russian writers)." In fact, there are too many prophets among modern Russian literary writers, and this point of fear is perhaps the most important feature of modern Russian literature.</p>
<p>Mr. Xu said with great interest that I "simply turned Turgenev into a god." Of course, I would not praise a writer that way, but at the same time, I cannot regard an artist as a completely passive, mechanical person without free will like Mr. Xu does. Except to say that in addition to such a piece of real raw material, the artist in the field of art, when creating characters, is not much different from God in the universe. God creates people as He pleases, but the artist cannot be like a camera. Please allow me to coin a new phrase: the artist is the God in the realm of his artistic creation! To regard the reality used by art as such a dead thing, and to say that the artist has no way to deal with it and can only act as a camera, is really taking the artist's job too easily and too low. Because Mr. Xu's degree of understanding of art is like this, he will ask: "...Does he think that if Artsybashev's artistic creative power was a little higher, he could turn Sanin from nothing into something?" It has already been recognized that the solidified Sanin, which is erroneously expressed in art, does not exist socially. Even if there is divine power from God, it will be in vain. However, this premise is already wrong. As far as I know, most literary historians do not completely deny the social existence of the type of person of Sanin. However, the solidified Sanin that was expressed in art by Artsybashev, because it was artistically untrue first, it will not have the possibility of social existence; to put it more clearly, "(the author of 'Sanin' has a mistaken understanding of the characters he created, and the norms for the social development of this character expressed in art are also wrong. The true Ponyin who develops in society has taken a path that is farther and farther away from Sanin in the artwork." When I talk about the untruthfulness of Sanin, I am talking about the Sanin displayed in this artwork — according to Artsybashev's understanding of the character of Sanin, his artistic expression of Sanin, and his prediction of what Sanin "should be," Sanin has become the writer's imaginary puppet. Conversely, according to Mr. Xu's mechanical view, the writer can always write everything that exists socially truthfully. However, I often see that because of the inaccuracy of understanding, or because of the inaccuracy of expression, the truth is also written as untrue. The author of 'Sanin' is such a writer, so Mr. Xu does not need to defend him and say: 'Mr. Shi Heng's criticism is really harsh!'"</p>
<p>But one thing I should always apologize to the readers and Mr. Xu for — that is, I cannot directly read Russian books. Based on several less-than-good translations, if I cannot get a full understanding of the art of the original work, and then make the above judgments, it is not only harsh, but even more so it can be said to be arbitrary. However, if compared with the translated books of other Russian literary works — unless the translation of "Sanin" is a special case, "Sanin," as a world-renowned masterpiece, its artistic creative power is really too far behind.</p>
<h3>Two Brothers (56)</h3>
<p>— By Maupassant, Translated by Li Weike</p>
<p>He decided to take advantage of his relocation to invite everyone to Saint-Jean for a picnic, and after dinner, invite everyone to his new house for tea. Old man Roland wanted to go by sea, but because of the long distance, and because if he encountered head winds, he didn't know when he could sail, everyone didn't agree with his method, so they rented a four-wheeled light carriage to take this hike.</p>
<p>Everyone set off at nearly ten o'clock, in order to get there for lunch. The dust-covered avenue unfolded in the middle of the countryside of Normandy, and the undulating wheat fields and the fields surrounded by trees made this countryside like an endless park. In the car pulled slowly by two fat horses, the Roland family, Mrs. Lu Zuimi, and Captain Bo Qiru were all silent, deafened by the sound of the wheels, and everyone closed their eyes in the snow-like dust.</p>
<p>This is the season of ripe harvest. Next to the deep green alfalfa and the raw green sugar beets, the yellow wheat illuminated the countryside with a golden light. These wheats seemed to have drunk the sunlight that fell on them. Here and there people were starting to harvest the wheat. In the fields attacked by sickles, we could see people swaying, swinging their wing-shaped blades around on the ground. After two hours of walking, the carriage turned into a road on the left, passing by the turning windmill, the melancholy gray remains, the half-rotted and forever abandoned, the last remaining of those old windmills, and then entered a beautiful courtyard and stopped in front of a beautiful house, which is a well-known inn.</p>
<p>The hostess, nicknamed "Beauty Ya'erfuqi," smiled and walked to the car door, extending her hand to the two ladies who were hesitating in front of the too high footstool.</p>
<p>Under a tent, on the side of the pasture covered with apple trees, some out-of-towners, some Parisians from Aiteda, were already having lunch; inside the house, everyone also heard some people's voices, laughter, and the sound of dishes.</p>
<p>All the dining rooms were full, and Roland and his party had to eat in the room. Suddenly, Roland saw some gray shrimp nets hanging on the wall.</p>
<p>"Ah! Ah!" he exclaimed, "Can you catch shrimp here?"</p>
<p>"Yes," Captain Bo Qiru replied, "and this is where the most shrimp are caught on the entire coast."</p>
<p>"Great! How about we go shrimping after lunch?"</p>
<p>It happened to be low tide at about five o'clock; so it was decided that everyone would go shrimping in the reefs in the afternoon for entertainment.</p>
<p>Everyone didn't eat much, lest they be in danger of cerebral congestion when stepping in the water. And everyone wanted to save their appetite for dinner, because a rich banquet had already been set, and it had to be prepared by six o'clock to wait for them to come back to eat.</p>
<p>Old man Roland was impatient. He wanted to buy the special shrimp-catching equipment that was very similar to the things used to catch butterflies in the pasture.</p>
<p>This thing is called Lanets. These are some small net bags tied to a wooden ring tied to the end of a long stick. Ya'erfuqi was always smiling, and lent this thing to him. Then she helped the two ladies make a temporary costume to avoid getting their robes wet. She lent them some short skirts, big wool socks, and grass sandals. The men took off their leather shoes and bought old shoes or wooden shoes to wear at the nearby shoemaker's house.</p>
<p>Then they set off together, with shrimp nets on their shoulders and baskets on their backs. Mrs. Lu Zuimi looked very good in this costume, showing an unexpected brave and charming style of a farm woman.</p>
<p>She playfully rolled up the short skirt that Ya'erfuqi lent her, sewed it tightly with a needle, so that she could run and jump boldly on those reefs. She exposed her ankles and the lower section of her calves, which were the strong and graceful small legs of that kind of woman. Her waist was not tied tightly, and she could turn it at will; she also found a gardener's large yellow wide-brimmed straw hat to wear on her head. One side of the straw hat was rolled up and tied with a willow branch, making her appear like a brave musketeer.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>A Certain Incident</h3>
<p>— Non-Human</p>
<p>Petty theft, robbery, and kidnapping are naturally illegal acts. The laws of the country have no reason to pardon them. Light sentences are given to imprisonment, and heavy sentences are rewarded with hygiene pills. It is indeed a due punishment, and the net of justice is inescapable.</p>
<p>But petty theft, robbery, and kidnapping are ultimately human. Among them, there are those who are "cursed by a thief's star" and willing to commit illegal acts. It cannot be said that there are none, but they are ultimately a small minority. Most are forced to take risks due to hunger and poverty. Therefore, without treating them fundamentally, these kinds of diseases are always difficult to cure. Unless they are killed, otherwise no matter how many months, or even years, of imprisonment, once the term expires, they will still do their deeds. And they know that every time they "fall in," they become bolder, because they have simply no way out other than this, no way to survive.</p>
<p>That is, a certain incident is naturally also an act of looting and plundering. Under the laws of the country, there is naturally no pardon for killing. But those who do this deed, although not necessarily starving and freezing, must have major demands equal to starvation and freezing. Based on this, we should find a way to prevent them from being hungry and cold, and even more so from using hunger and cold as an excuse to commit illegal acts. Otherwise, even if they are sentenced to imprisonment - because they can never be completely sentenced to death - one day they will still do a round of thieving. The so-called "there is only a thousand days of being a thief, but there is no thousand days of guarding against a thief."</p>
<p>Theft is naturally the most inferior behavior. Being a thief is even more despised by "working people." The person who is stolen from naturally hates them to the core and wants to put them to death as soon as possible. But from an outsider's point of view, there is naturally another kind of thought or opinion. This kind of feeling is indeed not sympathetic to the act of stealing, but after all, it is not as profound as the feelings of the person involved. It can be asserted.</p>
<p>The fundamental solutions for petty theft, robbery, and kidnapping are reform schools for criminals, etc., which can be treated. But for a certain kind of criminal, what kind of fundamental solution can be used to solve it? This answer is originally very complex and difficult to say. I just respectfully borrow a sentence from Confucius as an abstract statement, saying, "Cultivate oneself to bring peace to others."</p>
<h3>Water Cutoff Dispute</h3>
<p>— Wei Ba</p>
<p>Shanghai is a moving place name. The citizens of Shanghai are blessed. They do not hear the sound of cannons, nor do they see bombs falling from airplanes - although there was a time during the "January 28th Incident," but now it is gone. It is always better than other provinces. - As for the various departments needed for life, for eating, there are Chinese and Western dishes, and for clothing, there are Chinese and Western clothing. For living, there are tall Western-style houses, tap water, electric lights, telephones, and gas stoves. For transportation, there are trams and automobiles. For entertainment, there are amusement parks, movie theaters, dance halls, etc. There are also various conveniences that may or may not exist in other places, such as opium smoking, gambling, and brothels, and massage parlors... Shanghai has everything that a 20th-century city should have. You can spend money according to your wishes, without the various restrictions of the inland. Therefore, people in the inland generally say with red eyes: "Paradise!" "Paradise!" They flock to this city to become citizens, and Shanghai has thus become more prosperous.</p>
<p>But Shanghai's prosperity, although built on the backs of three million citizens, the great power is entrusted to the hands of hundreds of imperialist and semi-colonial rulers and their comprador class. The so-called enjoyment of all modern happiness is exchanged under the condition of "being tamely exploited." If you cannot bear the policy of exploitation, and dare to shout out a "pain!" then you have the opportunity not to eat the fruits of prosperity that you have planted.</p>
<p>If you don't believe it, look at the recent water cutoff storm in the three villages of Baifu, Bailu, and Baishou in Eastern Shanghai, and you will know how difficult it is for the imperialists to hide this face!</p>
<p>Since the British-owned water company implemented price increases, water cutoff storms have been reported endlessly everywhere. Although users have the determination, the company only uses high-pressure methods to intimidate them with "water cutoffs." The water cutoff dispute in the three villages of Baifu, etc., has been going on for more than a month. Due to the determination of the users and the strong attitude of the company, it has not been resolved so far. Although the owners and users of these villages have sent representatives to petition the Ministry of Public Works, they have not achieved satisfactory results. On the other hand, the water company believes that the users' unwillingness to be submissive is a great loss to its "British" dignity. Therefore, after the water cutoff, it is still not satisfied. Recently, it cut off the fire hydrants installed in the villages at a cost of more than two thousand taels of silver. Not only did it cut off the fire hydrants in the villages, but it also closed the main water pipes for the fire hydrants on the roads between Fenzhou Road and Pingliang Road (near the villages). As a result, there was not a drop of water, causing panic among more than two thousand people who needed water every day. "People cannot live without water and fire." The residents of these villages had no choice but to prepare large water tanks and hire porters to fetch water from the Huangpu River for emergency use in order to maintain their lives. But how can the dirty Huangpu River water be used as drinking water? The occurrence of fire is especially worrying. It cannot but be said that it has a major impact on the public security of the city. But in the eyes of the rulers of the semi-colony, this is a due punishment - who told you not to be tamely exploited and insisted on shouting pain - this is the "unlucky" fact in the "blessed land" of Shanghai.</p>
<p>We know that tap water is a public utility. Public undertakings should take the public welfare as the premise. Moreover, the water problem is directly related to the health, disasters, and survival of all citizens. It must not be manipulated by individuals. But in this capitalist society, in the semi-colonial Shanghai under capitalist rule, what else can be said!</p>
<p>The more than two thousand residents of the three villages of Baifu, etc., it must be said that they are members of "prosperous Shanghai," right? But what is the result? In order not to be exploited, they shouted "pain!" and then risked their lives to drink Huangpu River water! What do the same members of prosperous Shanghai feel about this situation?</p>
<h3>Everyone Welcome</h3>
<p>— Mi Er</p>
<p>The most noteworthy news in this city these past two days is of course Marconi's whereabouts. In the scientific world, there is such a great invention as his. Mr. Marconi is worthy of our sincere welcome, and it is not an accidental thing. Moreover, foreigners welcoming us Chinese, and us Chinese welcoming foreigners, are just each fulfilling our duty as hosts, and are not unusual actions that are surprising and eye-catching. However, the facts tell us that foreigners sometimes really have the value of being welcomed by us, while us Chinese, who can give foreigners the value of being welcomed, can be said to be extremely rare! For example: Shaw, who came last time. His authority in the world of literature, and his spirit of being young at an old age, etc., are all worthy of us to welcome him to come and give our pitifully dry China beneficial guidance. Marconi, who came this time, is an electrical inventor, and is naturally even more worthy of our welcome. They can bring glory to their motherland by coming here, and can give our younger generation accurate guidance. Therefore, their travels are not only beneficial to them personally or to their motherland, but also to all mankind, like a heavy rain to withered seedlings. It is really a profound blessing! This is also the most powerful reason why a few foreign guests are worthy of our welcome.</p>
<p>Then, among us Chinese who come to foreign countries every year and receive a warm welcome from foreigners, besides Finance Minister Song, I am afraid that only the world-famous peace soldier Mr. Zhang is left - his being "world-famous" is of course not accidental either. He sacrificed everything to show his spirit of upholding world peace! And after the September 18th Incident, he did not get the world peace prize. We should ask Marconi to invent yin and yang telegraphs, so that we can send a very urgent telegram to Wang Yineng, asking him to speak up for that peaceful young marshal in front of King Yama when he is traveling in the underworld!</p>
<p>Although the World Peace Prize Committee cannot appreciate our Zhang Young Marshal, and the domestic compatriots cannot understand him, foreigners welcome him very much. Don't you see that he is also as welcomed abroad as Mr. Shaw and Mr. Marconi? However, the intentions of the welcome are different. When we welcome Mr. Shaw and Mr. Marconi, our intention is, on the one hand, to express our admiration, and on the other hand, to ask them to guide our younger generation; while the foreigners welcome Mr. Zhang, their intention is probably to raise his status, hoping that he will return to his motherland to hold important military and political positions in the future, and give some territory to his stubbornness, just like they gave to our short neighbor during the September 18th Incident!</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang is about to return. It is said that the National Government will entrust him with important tasks. Let's see the second great promotion of his spirit of peace!</p>

<h3>Rites - Ten Days' Salary -</h3>
<p>— Meng Da</p>
<p>Old Zhao, who is always busy and never has a moment to spare, of course! Driven by life, he is exhausted from eight hours of monotonous (office) life and some unavoidable boring social engagements, his back aches and his head spins. When he returns home, all he wants is to rest in bed. But his inconsiderate wife, Mei, is nagging him endlessly:</p>
<p>: (Next month is my father's birthday on the ninth. As his eldest son-in-law, what gift are you planning to give?)</p>
<p>(A gift? We'll see!) Old Zhao answered casually, yawning.</p>
<p>(The Xing sister's family is sending: a treasure blue satin canopy, a pure white jade Ruyi scepter, and two sets of carrying poles with twenty bottles of wine. What are we going to prepare?)</p>
<p>(They all do that. But I don't feel the need to compete with them.)</p>
<p>(Compete?) Mei seemed a little unhappy. She said, "I didn't intend to compete with them! Anyway, this is all about your face."</p>
<p>(Let's talk about this in a few days! There are still ten days anyway. Has anyone come to see me today?) Old Zhao wanted to drop the subject, so he changed the topic.</p>
<p>(What kind of person? No one came to see you. Sigh! Why are you always so lukewarm? No matter what you do, you're always so unenthusiastic? It's really infuriating! Even though there are still ten days left, shouldn't we discuss it earlier?) Mei said, getting angry, half-angry and half-complaining.</p>
<p>(Then what do you want to do?) Old Zhao felt he had nothing to say.</p>
<p>(I was going to ask you! You are the head of the family, what ideas do I have?) Mei still maintained this attitude, clearly having her own opinion but unwilling to speak first.</p>
<p>Old Zhao laughed and said, (Since you have no ideas, shouldn't I be the one to represent you fully? I'll naturally have a plan in a few days.)</p>
<p>(Again with the 'in a few days'? Where is that going to lead? Can't you put in a little effort? You're always procrastinating.)</p>
<p>(Alright! It's too late tonight! Hmm, tomorrow is the end of the month, the day after tomorrow is the first. Good! I'll definitely get the salary from the company on the first, and I'll take care of it for you. Then you don't need to nag anymore!)</p>
<p>On the first day, Old Zhao received his salary from the office and returned</p>
<p>home. He remembered his wife's instructions and, in order not to disappoint her enthusiasm, he had to do his best to follow her wishes. He went around to various places and bought a large package of gifts, then called a streetcar to his residence.</p>
<p>Looking at the large package of items on the streetcar, Old Zhao thought to himself: (Human relationships are as urgent as debts.) This human relationship (what is called 'rites') is even more terrible than debt! If you owe someone money, you can ask to pay tomorrow or beg for a few more days; but this so-called rite! You can't delay it arbitrarily, huh! Giving rites is fine! But people will also complain about how lavish or meager the gifts you give are!</p>
<p>Old Zhao was lost in thought. The streetcar had already pulled into his residence on Ren Cheng Street, number several, before he snapped out of it and quickly ordered the driver to stop at the back door of number eight. The driver helped him carry the things into the house. His wife, Mei, had already guessed what they were for! But she deliberately asked:</p>
<p>(What is this? Such a big package.)</p>
<p>(Guess, and if you guess correctly, I'll give it to your father.) Old Zhao joked, while paying the driver.</p>
<p>Mei opened the package with a smile. Inside were two boxes, one large and one small, both with redwood frames and high-quality glass. The large box contained a set of white porcelain (Fu, Lu, Shou - the three stars of prosperity, status, and longevity), over two feet tall, covered in colorful gold, and very exquisite. The small box contained a pair of high-footed silver cups, about eight inches tall, with particularly elaborate carvings. Then she looked at Old Zhao and smiled contentedly!</p>
<p>(Can these things compare to a jade Ruyi scepter?) Old Zhao asked sarcastically.</p>
<p>(It's not that I wanted you to buy these things to compete with them, it's really for your face. And it makes me feel more glorious in front of my sisters and family!) Mei was very happy, of course, and comforted Old Zhao carefully.</p>
<p>(Humph! Face? But ten days' salary...) Old Zhao's stomach was empty, and a bitter smile appeared on his face.</p>
<h3>I Did Not Sell My Soul</h3>
<p>— Lie Huo</p>
<p>I smelled the small building, not more than ten feet square, the white plastered walls having faded to a dark brown. The window facing the outside was not as big as a square table, and the alley was so narrow. The sister-in-law across the building still had so many diapers hanging high to dry every day, making the small building even darker. All seasons had a pungent musty smell. To the right of the window, layered newspapers were pasted, which was the (makeshift) wardrobe, covered with a thick layer of dust and cobwebs.</p>
<p>This was Old Dai's apartment for the past three years.</p>
<p>In the morning, he simply splashed some cold water on his face, sat near the writing desk with a sagging leg, and picked up his pen to write something, but his fingers always trembled a bit. His eyes shifted to the layered newspapers. The weather was gradually getting colder! Lined coats and woolen shirts were on his body, with only that tattered cotton-padded jacket hanging in the layered newspapers. Considering the cold these days, it was really enough to add more layers. But even colder weather was coming, rainy days, frosty days, snowy days! How would he endure it in the future?</p>
<p>He thought of this, and he froze.</p>
<p>(Dong dong dong), suddenly there was a knock at the door, and then Old Chen was standing next to him. Old Chen was a little surprised and asked, (Dai, what are you thinking about again? The manuscript paper is soaked!)</p>
<p>(Oh, you're here! Old Chen, it's you! It's quite cold outside!) Old Dai's shy eyes blinked repeatedly, wanting to hide his secret.</p>
<p>(Yes, it's even colder outside! Why don't you put on your cotton-padded jacket?)</p>
<p>(Um?——) Old Dai didn't say anything more.</p>
<p>They looked at each other in silence.</p>
<p>Old Dai took a breath, pursed his lips, clenched his fist, and felt much more energetic. He began to express his opinions:</p>
<p>(This society is very ridiculous. It's a society where people eat people. Those with ability can't get a guarantee of life, but those without ability mostly enjoy unrestrained pleasure. The difference lies in whether you have a soul. If you sell your soul, you will have a way out, you can rise rapidly; otherwise, society will ignore you. The breadth of your social circle depends entirely on this.</p>
<p>Old Chen, you should know! I don't have much ability, but that's not the only reason for my bad luck. It's really because I haven't sold my soul. There haven't been a few opportunities in the past two or three years, but there have been quite a few; however, they all have a prerequisite, which is to first buy my soul. My nature is firm. I haven't sold my soul, I don't want to sell my soul. That's why the opportunities that were already in my grasp have all rolled away, which is also the main reason why I'm a little trembling right now.</p>
<p>The material blows I have suffered in the past two or three years have been enough, but I have still maintained my soul. That is, my soul still has a home. I am eagerly waiting for a beautiful social future, and my soul will be poured onto those flower branches, to be vented for the will that I admire!</p>
<p>I believe that society will never be completely dark forever, and the employers of souls in today's society will eventually be destroyed. They can only bully those who are weak-willed and lack clear understanding. These people are like parasites in society, just like the employers. If they wake up and join our group—the group that vows not to sell their souls—what can the employers do? This is when society will have a solution.</p>
<p>Old Chen, what is lacking now is a group of people who do not sell their souls!</p>
<p>(You keep talking about soul, soul, it's really a bit confusing!) Old Chen interrupted his train of thought.</p>
<p>(The soul is one's own will! The social truth that we wholeheartedly believe in!) They returned to the previous silence.</p>

<h3>Three-Character Secrets of Astrology</h3>
<p>— Shi Ben</p>
<p>The night before last, I ate Tangbing wine at Old Hu's house. There were eleven people at the table, drinking and chatting wildly. Some discussed current affairs, some talked about love affairs, and some talked about gambling strategies. Only Old Yu, who came from the military and had traveled all over central and northern China, had connections with all kinds of people from the three religions and nine streams. Therefore, he was also very familiar with the tricks of the underworld. That night, he told us the (three-character secret) of astrologers who cheat people. His words were accurate and reasonable, worthy of his old underworld nature of traveling all over the north and south! Everyone present held their breath and listened attentively. He said: (People often say that there is an astrologer who is very accurate, and there is a physiognomist who is very effective, as if these astrologers can really know the past and future. Therefore, the potential power of astrologers in society is deeply rooted, and the careers of these people are endless, and their doors are crowded! In fact, the so-called (Qimen Dunjia), (King Wen's divination), (XX physiognomy), etc., of these astrologers are all just pretending. In fact, the only way they cheat money is by relying on a (three-character secret) passed down by their master. Whether they are astrologers or physiognomists, as long as they use this secret to adapt to the situation, they will be invincible, and people will unanimously say how miraculous they are! Once the show is exposed, there is nothing rare. Since I learned this (three-character secret), I have never believed in all kinds of astrology in society, and I have saved a lot of wasted money all year round. Now I am not stingy, I will tell you this secret publicly, so that you can save some unnecessary expenses after listening to it. Speaking of my (three-character secret), it was when I was the head of the regiment in Chuzhou during the early years of the Republic of China that I met a very popular astrologer. We became very close over time, so he exceptionally told me about it. However, this (secret) is very simple, it only has three words, which are: (Praise, Promise, Sigh). What is meant by (Praise)? That is, when you meet someone who asks you to calculate the fate or examine the appearance of a child, you must (Praise) the child. Because: people who ask about the fate and appearance of children must like to hear auspicious words. If you understand the psychology of these parents, you can vividly and flamboyantly (Praise) their child, saying how he will soar in the future, become a high official, and make a fortune. The fate and appearance are good, it is an (XX pattern), (XX shape). Such a blessed and noble life is rare in the world! Give them a solid flattery (that is, Praise). Therefore, his parents will inevitably be infinitely happy in their hearts, and turn their backs and undoubtedly publicize that this gentleman is so miraculous. The second word (Promise) is for young adults. For example, if a thirty-year-old man comes to ask about his appearance or fortune, he must have had a bad environment and unsuccessful work in recent years, otherwise, he would not come to ask. So you can say: Your Excellency has been unsuccessful in recent years, but this bad luck can be passed on at the age of thirty-three, and from the age of thirty-four, things will turn around, the clouds will clear and the sun will shine, and from then on, everything will go smoothly for fifteen years. When he hears such a (Promise), he will definitely be happy in his heart. You just have to try it. If you ask about your fate at the age of twenty-five, he will definitely (Promise) you good luck at the age of thirty, but once you reach the age of thirty and ask him again, he will say that you will have good luck at the age of thirty-five. Such words are the secret of the (Promise) word. Finally, let's talk about the (Sigh) word. You know, when a person reaches the age of fifty or sixty, he is old and frail. If he still asks about his fate or appearance, it is clear that his situation is not good. Otherwise, he would not come to ask an astrologer, so when you meet an old person who asks about his fate or appearance, you can (Sigh) and say that his life has been unsuccessful in the past, and pretend to give a clear example, for example, say: Your Excellency's fate, it's a pity that XX and XX conflict, so it is difficult to be satisfied in life. If you are looking at the appearance, then you should: It's a pity (the ground is too low), it's a pity (the eyes are too exposed), so you will be busy all your life and achieve nothing! (Sigh) vertically and horizontally, this old man will deeply believe that his fate and appearance are really not good, so he admires the astrologer's truly effective skill!) Everyone in the audience listened to Old Yu's plausible explanation, and everyone applauded and laughed, calling him (Old Underworld, Old Underworld) endlessly.</p>
<h3>Unable to Die and Unable Not to Die</h3>
<p>— Tong Sheng</p>
<p>Speaking of death, everyone will have some fear. The nose stops breathing, the blood stops circulating, the cells stop moving, the nerves lose their function, and, moreover, everything is gone, women are gone, everything is gone, and oneself is gone. Becoming gray, the body is also hard, put into a dark wooden house, and never seeing the light of day again, this is really a terrible thing!</p>
<p>Death is the end of a person's life, the end of the track of life, that is, a major event that anyone cannot avoid, so regardless of whether one is wise or foolish, everyone will die. You will die, I will die. If your death is coming, then no matter how big your face is, you can't talk it over, and no matter how much money you have to spend, you can't move it. You are not afraid of having guns to defend yourself, or airplanes to escape. Even if you secretly hide in a dark cave, the King of Hell will still send a mysterious god of death to invite you.</p>
<p>In fact, death is not terrible, it is just as ordinary as wearing clothes and eating. Even if you are afraid, you can't stop it. You must know that there is birth, then there must be death, so what is there to be afraid of? The transmission of society is the cycle of life and death in the biological world. Take our Shanghai as an example, which day does not have dead people carried out? Looking even more closely, among all the human beings in the world, the daily production rate is always in the tens of thousands, and the daily mortality rate is also in the tens of thousands. Birth and death are really busy all the time. Looking at the entire biological world, morning mushrooms do not know dawn and dusk, cicadas do not know spring and autumn, born and dying, dying and born, what is so strange?</p>
<p>However, death, in our human group, there is a distinction between unable to die and unable not to die. I will now boldly make a brief definition: those who cannot die are great people; those who cannot not die are ordinary people. Those who cannot die are capitalists; those who cannot not die are laborers. Those who cannot die are fashionable women in the city; those who cannot not die are abandoned widows. In short: those who cannot die are rich and powerful people; those who cannot not die are pitiful people who do not know what the next day will bring.</p>
<p>Unable to die and unable not to die obviously have class characteristics. Those who cannot die are a small number of special classes; those who cannot not die are the majority of the lower classes. The higher the status, the greater the power, the more their degree of unable to die increases accordingly. Even if they are old and reach the age of eighty or ninety, they still say that they cannot die. Therefore, there are guards protecting them before and after, and镖师accompanying them, and even people who set up承露盘asking for immortality medicine, and send envoys to Penglai to ask Taoist priests for advice. As for cultivating Taoism and seeking Buddhism, it is their common practice. Because the stronger their confidence in not dying, the greater their fear of death, selling their strength and fighting against death. Suppose these ships of those who cannot die were to die completely, then whose blood would the common people let be sucked? However, at the same time, the common people are unable not to die!</p>
<p>As for the poor common people, they are born with cheap bones. They are bitter all day long and hungry all winter. Modern celebrity calligraphy Zhang Zhaofen, Ms. Zi Xiaobi, Sichuan people.</p>
<p>Tenants entering the door cannot cover themselves from the wind and sun, and cannot eat their fill of coarse food, shedding blood and tears, unable to finish, wives and children hungry and cold, parents hungry, so in this situation of wanting to die but not being able to die, they can only hug their stomachs) Oh my God!)</p>
<p>Also, there are those who contain grievances and burdens, women with grievances and men with emptiness, Jingwei's hatred cannot be filled in the sea, Nüwa's love cannot be made up in the sky, tears are exhausted and then blood is continued, the head is sore and the days are like years, worry and anger fill the chest, and they hate their remaining lives. It is also the general situation of those who seek death but cannot.</p>
<p>Also, like on the Huangpu River, at the head of Swallow Rock, that is the final solution for those who cannot not die. And the dead adults have funeral offices, telegram obituaries, shamans and Taoist priests chanting scriptures, beggars playing flags, and people writing inscriptions to praise their merits, this is just the finale of those who cannot die.</p>
<h3>Melon Cap</h3>
<p>— Peng Xiang</p>
<p>When the weather turns cold, melon caps are popular.</p>
<p>As soon as I see this thing, I think of tied trousers, yellow faces, bowing, clasping hands, and being gentle and refined.</p>
<p>Western cartoonists draw an old man with a top hat, named Uncle Sam, to represent America; Germany is a soldier wearing a military cap with a messy beard; as for China, I haven't paid attention. But I think: if you draw a melon cap, and below it a pointed chin, preferably with a pair of tied trousers, it would be very appropriate, and it can indeed represent the style of this (great nation).</p>
<p>Even now, many foreigners probably still think of Chinese people as having pigtails, peacock feathers, court beads, and horseshoe sleeves; but times have evolved, and these people are no longer seen. Replacing them is not a gentleman's hat, like Uncle Sam's, not a military cap, like Big Brother Germany's, and not a worker's cap; but a melon cap.</p>
<p>I remember that on the cover of a certain magazine's New Year's issue last year, there were two old men wearing melon caps, tortoiseshell glasses, and tied trousers, bowing to each other: meaning to celebrate the New Year. On one side was a big red note, and below it was a classic quote from an ancient person, written in a refined manner.</p>
<p>This gave me a powerful reminder: China is now indeed being ruled by melon caps!</p>

<h3>Shanghai (17)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Lao San</p>
<p>I moved the chess pieces at will. Without twenty minutes of confrontation, Little Huang's chariot and horse cannon displayed their power in my territory; although there was no complete defeat, I felt dizzy and my forehead throbbed faintly. Forcing a smile, I pushed the chessboard away and said; (I lost).</p>
<p>Twenty-eight Diseases</p>
<p>I didn't eat dinner and went to bed in the bedroom alone. I felt upset, unable to say what kind of complicated thoughts were occupying me. My limbs were feverish, and my forehead was even more terribly scorched: but the gentle breeze in the May night blew in from the corner of the window, and I seemed unable to bear it and covered myself with a quilt.</p>
<p>Gao Fei and others, seeing that I was unhappy today, gathered around my bed after dinner. I didn't want anyone to disturb me, but seeing so many of them, I felt even more unspeakable irritability, but I was too embarrassed to ask them to give me a quiet rest for the time being, so I just closed my eyes and ignored them.</p>
<p>(Qingping, why are you suffering! Little Huang apologizes for requesting to leave the club!) Gao Fei's small voice broke the suffocating space.</p>
<p>I opened my eyes and saw Little Huang's back leaning against the window, (he was thinking,) I thought (we friends in the club have gone through thick and thin together. Today, because of my personal affairs, Little Huang requested to leave the club) I felt a burst of sadness, and sobbed, (Little Huang, please close the window, I have something to say.) I beckoned for everyone to come to my bedside.</p>
<p>Watching Little Huang walk over reluctantly, I held his hand and said, (Quick, don't have this idea, everything has nothing to do with you. Today I went to Xujiahui and ran around a lot, and I didn't eat for two meals, but I had a full meal in the afternoon, and I also drank shaved ice nearby when I came back, I'm afraid I'll have a fever tonight, please forgive me, I understand everything now) My throat was dry and sore, and I turned my head to see Chongqing leaning against the desk, so I asked him (Chongqing, please give me some boiled water.)</p>
<p>After drinking the boiled water, I continued to say, (I hope that you will not suffer for me personally) I said, holding Little Huang's hand even tighter (Now I need to rest, please forgive me.)</p>
<p>After speaking, I panted slightly and glanced at them pleadingly, as if I were very weak and closed my eyelids. I couldn't remember when I fell asleep.</p>
<p>I woke up in the middle of the night, my whole body felt like it was being roasted by fire. I opened my hot eyes and wanted to sit up, and saw Sister Min sitting silently by the bed.</p>
<p>(Brother, do you want to drink tea?) She asked softly when she saw that I was awake.</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>(Is your body comfortable?) She pressed my forehead.</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>(Brother, don't be angry when you are sick yourself. I have seen Sister Hui, and our misunderstanding has been explained clearly. You sleep quietly, and I am going to sleep too.) She spoke softly, but showing a happy look.</p>
<p>(What time is it?) I suddenly remembered to ask.</p>
<p>(Half past three.) Sister Min looked at her watch and said. She covered me with the quilt at random, and smiled softly out of the door.</p>

<h3>What is the Secret to Staying Young? Maintain Mental Alertness</h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>▲Elizabeth Arden's View</p>
<p>▲Beauty Salons Cannot Guarantee Eternal Youth</p>
<p>Elizabeth Arden needs no further introduction. She is a Hollywood star; in addition, she is a novelist; she is good at music; she possesses the health and beauty of youth. Therefore, her methods for preserving youthful beauty carry considerable authority. The most important words she has to say about the art of staying young are: (Even if you live in a beauty salon, you cannot maintain your youth. Your spirit, your thoughts, and your entire life plan must be filled with the vibrancy of spring; only then can your face reflect your youth). The following is her explanation of the above statement:</p>
<p>(But don't misunderstand me. I am not saying that beauty salons are unimportant and should be abolished; on the contrary, beauty salons are very important, essential for modern women in their quest for the fountain of youth. Many of the best cosmetics have become firmly established necessities in today's civilized world. If a woman refuses to use the beauty tools at her disposal, she can be called a traitor to women, or even a fool.</p>
<p>(Many well-known beauty aids have indeed made modern women more beautiful than ever imagined in the past. But you must know that no matter how many beautiful clothes you prepare by the trunkload, your beauty can never exceed what your face and hair allow. Beauty salons can certainly provide you with a lot of help here. But the best beauty salon in the world is not a magic palace; it has no art of eternal youth. It can help you, but you must do your own part if you want to maintain youthful beauty forever. Clothes can be put on, but beauty cannot be put on like clothes. It must come from within.</p>
<p>(The greatest enemy of human age is boredom in life. When we recall our lives in school, we are amazed at how interesting and fun they were. If a female student doesn't know how to find interesting and fun things, people will give her a nickname, calling her an (old woman). A woman's lifelong mental nourishment is surprising things. If she feels that the world is amazing and interesting, her mind will age. Once her mind ages, her face will wither! Therefore, a woman's mental (alertness) is the key to maintaining beauty.</p>
<p>(Some people say that these words are just theories put forth by female stars because the lives of female stars are naturally full of surprises and interests. And they have the opportunity, money, and time to seek out surprising things. But a housewife cannot find surprises. Such words are specious. The biggest problem for housewives is not that they cannot find surprises in life, but that they do not seek them out. The essence of surprise is simply (change). They sit in their rooms, dull and listless, unwilling to change anything in their actions or thoughts. Thus, their youth is consumed in a dull atmosphere. They may see their husbands pleased with women older than themselves and feel baffled. They don't know that those women, although older, are younger than them in spirit and thought.</p>
<p>(Speaking of the word (change), it can be applied on a small or large scale. On a large scale, we can say that the universe is full of all kinds of amazing things that can invigorate our minds and enliven our bodies. Even the competition in games, the records in books, the people we encounter every day, the mountains and rivers we see everywhere, and everyone's good hobbies—anything that can make you mentally happy can be considered a surprising thing. But these things must not be used to make your mind tired. Everything is like eating delicious food; at first, it tastes very good, but you get tired of it when you are full. So, whether it's exercise, games, reading, making friends, or traveling, never indulge to the fullest; you should stop when appropriate and switch to something fresher and more interesting. If you are a housewife, on a small scale, even changing the position of the furniture in your home from time to time, changing the style of all the furnishings, is enough to make your mind feel refreshed. Of course, this doesn't require spending a lot of money.</p>
<p>(A woman's place is not necessarily in the home. So the changes in your home are not enough to limit your activities in seeking surprises. You can find some outdoor sports, make some new friends, and see new scenery. This is not to say that you should like the new and hate the old, but rather to increase your ways of loving old friends. Whether it's a game, a book, or a friend, you will get tired of being with them for too long. But if you switch to a new game, read a new book, or make a new friend, not only can you maintain a good impression of the old things, but after a while, it's like old friends reuniting after a long separation, and the interest will definitely be stronger, and the spirit will not be tired.)</p>
<p>Film Reviews</p>
<h3>Review of (Flying Devils)</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Flying Devils</p>
<p>(American movies are really getting tiresome, it's just another love story.) I think anyone who has seen too many American movie love dramas feels this way. Indeed, American films really can't come up with any new tricks in this area. Man A loves Woman B, Man C gets jealous, and in the end, the jealous person either dies tragically or willingly steps aside, and then the lovers get married and live happily ever after. We've seen this story countless times. The formula is always the same; it's just a matter of changing the names of the protagonists a few times, or the background in which the love affair takes place. For example, what is described here is a flying team, a team member falls in love with the team leader's wife, and the wife also develops a relationship because of her husband's tyranny. Later, the team leader becomes jealous and plans to kill, but ends up sacrificing himself, and then the team member and the wife are reunited.</p>
<p>An ordinary and vulgar story!</p>
<p>However, there are some commendable aspects in the performance, which are worth noting in detail below:</p>
<p>(1) The director's psychological depiction of the main characters is generally good. Arline Judge, who plays the housewife, has proven in many films that she has the special ability to perform quietly and seriously, which is particularly appropriate here. When she discovers the young team member in the play, she soon falls deeply in love, and is worn down by her tyrannical husband, becoming indifferent. That kind of indifferent state of mind makes people feel both lovable and pitiful. When she is doing laundry and listening to the young man playing pleasant music, anyone who has had the same life experience will definitely feel sad and speechless. And when the young team member accidentally injures her finger with the washing machine, she only cries out slightly in pain, without any resentment, which can be said to be extremely delicate. Also, when she is flying in the moonlight with the young man, her happy mood is only fully expressed by leaning on the young man's chest. As for the seductive eyes when she signs a photo to give to a guest, they reveal her original charm. … These are all things worth learning from.</p>
<p>(2) The team leader's tyranny and sadness due to his wife's change of heart are very commendable in several scenes in the tavern. Also, when he finds only one pillow on the bed in the mountain cabin, he fully understands his wife's ambiguous situation, and his hidden anger is also a clever touch by the director.</p>
<p>(3) The editing of news footage of aircraft performances is also appropriate and commendable. As for some shortcomings, we must also point them out:</p>
<p>(1) After the team leader dies, the stimulation given to the audience is not very slight after all. If it ended like this, it could leave a lingering aftertaste, but the director couldn't escape the general cliché of American films, and came up with a big happy ending, which makes people feel unharmonious and vulgar. However, the story must have an ending, but this ending is not very brilliant after all.</p>
<p>(2) The tone of the play is too flat. Although there are some scenes of aircraft performances, such as when the housewife first discovers that the young man is in danger of dying, she runs to tell the young man's brother, which is quite tense, but in the extremely flat tone, it is only a small seriousness after all.</p>
<p>Other things, such as the photography of the moonlight flight, are excellent, and the dialogue is also very concise. Generally speaking, they are all acceptable.</p>
<h3>(Osmanthus Lawyer) Review of Love, Honor and Oh Baby</h3>
<p>— Moore</p>
<p>(Osmanthus Lawyer) is a comedy. Generally speaking, comedies are focused on (humor). Therefore, many completely unreasonable stories are no longer questioned by the audience as long as they are said to be (comedies). In fact, no matter what, art is always produced through human beings. Even if a story is unreasonable, we can still clearly understand its (consciousness) if we carefully examine it. Not to mention anything else, even why the producer wants to create such an unreasonable story, and why the story is in this form—these already explain the producer's (concept).</p>
<p>Since (Osmanthus Lawyer) is a comedy, its subject matter should be lighter, but the story of (Osmanthus Lawyer) is extremely serious. (A lawyer's business is stagnant, and his girlfriend, Connie, introduces a lawsuit to him, but he dismisses it. Later, Connie joins a big banker as a female employee), meaning (to punish his neglect). Her method of (punishing neglect) is (to pretend to be accommodating) to make him—the banker—(flattered), and finally, when he (presents her with beautiful clothes), he is caught by the lawyer and another friend, and prosecuted according to law, fined 100,000, and the lawyer's name is greatly enhanced. In this story, we see:</p>
<p>First, Connie's behavior is simply (contrived) and close to a honey trap.</p>
<p>Second, the lawyer's only talent is to catch the banker who sends clothes to Connie.</p>
<p>Third, in the current American society, if a boyfriend gives a woman a set of clothes, it is considered a crime and can be (prosecuted according to law).</p>
<p>Of the above three points, except for the last one, which the producer could not resolve and (messed up), the first two points are an internal exposure of the current society and are quite cynical.</p>
<p>Naturally, the producer did not intend to do this. He first wrote the lawyer as a (peaceful) (good person), and then, after the banker was fooled, immediately gave an explanation and picture of why the banker was (notorious on weekdays, so people were very happy), which shows that the producer sympathizes with the lawyer and Connie. There is another point that we must seriously point out, that is, the producer's writing of the banker's being fooled is only a personal resentment towards people who are (notorious), not a general hatred of bankers. If this point is not clarified, it is absolutely impossible to grasp the social basis of this (Osmanthus Lawyer).</p>
<p>As for the (slapstick comedy) itself, it must first contain cynical satire to avoid becoming a worthless work, which everyone knows. Therefore, technically, the first thing a comedy must do is have a laughable story structure. If this point is not achieved, and it is just a few funny faces, just working on a few falls, it will at most give shallow audiences temporary laughter. Unfortunately, (Osmanthus Lawyer) has fallen into this problem, and therefore has simply become a (messy) film.</p>
<p>We know that the director has decisive control over the actors' actions. In ordinary films, the actors must first be natural and not too contrived, and slapstick comedies also need to be natural, but within the naturalness, there must be laughable places, like the actions of children, which are naturally very natural, but some places are (funny) and make people laugh. Directors of comedies should pay attention to this kind of place. The protagonist of (Osmanthus Lawyer) is originally very famous, but some of his actions are too contrived, which is the failure of the director. As for the smooth development of the story and the careful consideration of the camera angles, these are achievements that cannot be denied.</p>
<h3>No Rabbits Allowed</h3>
<p>— Wang Zhuying</p>
<p>(No Rabbits Allowed)</p>
<p>Here, I will tell you a very funny story. I believe you will definitely find it interesting. This is a joke made by the famous American silver star Jac Oakic and Judith Arleny.</p>
<p>One day, they were about to go to the company to work. But just as they were about to leave, Judith suddenly ran to the backyard to find a newly bought little rabbit.</p>
<p>(What are you looking for, Judith?)</p>
<p>(Looking for that rabbit I love the most.)</p>
<p>(What for?)</p>
<p>(I want to take it to the studio to play!)</p>
<p>(Judith, I think it's better to leave it at home. Rabbits can't stand our playing!)</p>
<p>Jac Oakic said to her very sincerely, but she could not accept Jac Oakic's words and continued to look for it excitedly. As a result, she found it. So she proudly said to Jac Oakic:</p>
<p>(Now that it belongs to me, I will always cherish it. I can't leave it. I always feel unbearable in my heart when I leave it!)</p>
<p>At this point, Jac Oakic had nothing to say. However, he felt that it was very dangerous to take the rabbit to the company. Because he thought of the many puppies in the company, and dogs are incompatible with rabbits. Then, if Judith takes this rabbit to the company, all those puppies will definitely chase after it. Wouldn't the timid rabbit be scared to death? Jac thought of this and felt very uneasy.</p>
<p>(There are so many puppies in the company. In my opinion, it's better to leave the rabbit at home. If you take it in, there's no doubt that you'll suffer.)</p>
<p>(No! No!)</p>
<p>At this time, they were both silent, walking step by step closer to the company's door. Coincidentally, it was the beginning of the American recovery movement, and the symbol of recovery commonly recognized throughout the country was a square flag with a blue eagle painted on it, and the three letters "NRA" were written above the eagle. The clever Jac Oakic, unable to find a suitable solution, suddenly saw this flag of the recovery movement hanging in front of the company's door, and his mind moved. So he said to Judith: (Judith, look! The "NRA" written on that flag is the abbreviation of "No Rabbits Allowed." They are already warning you, are you still going to take the rabbit in?)</p>
<p>(Since it's really not allowed, then it has no choice but to stay out.) Judith said, and put the rabbit outside, and went in empty-handed.</p>
<p>Only now did Judith realize that she had been tricked by Jac Oakic, but as she savored the past events carefully, she felt that his care for the rabbit was the same as her own, so she forgave him.</p>
<h3>Film Novel Little Women (7)</h3>
<p>— Suyin</p>
<p>Laurie poked his head in, urging Mama. He caught sight of Qiao's bald spot on the back of her head, but he didn't have time to say anything. He helped Mrs. March into the carriage. The four girls saw them off at the door. Mama called out, (My darlings, goodbye! May God take care of you!) They stood silently, waving their hands, until the carriage was far away and out of sight. Then they wiped away their tears one by one and went inside.</p>
<p>In grief and sorrow, only hard work can help people alleviate all the pain. Therefore, after Mama left, they all worked diligently. Among them, Beth's daily task was to go to the home of the people who received their Christmas Day breakfast to help them with their chores. One day, Qiao returned from her aunt's house and saw Beth sitting alone in Mama's room. Seeing that her face was pale and her eyes were wide open, she quickly asked her what she was doing. Beth burst into tears, saying that the child had died. Qiao asked her what child. She said the Hummels' child, and that since Mama left, she had been going to their house every day to take care of their little children. That child died in her arms, and the child's illness was scarlet fever. Beth's face leaned against Qiao's face, and Qiao felt that her face was already burning hot, knowing that she had been infected. She quickly told her to lie down, and at the same time told Hannah to get a doctor and Laurie to send Amy to her aunt's house, because Amy had not had that disease and was bound to be infected. Amy initially refused to go, saying that she would rather die at home than be bullied by her aunt. But after Qiao and Laurie's repeated pleas, she finally agreed. When the doctor arrived, Qiao and Meg were pale with fear, you looking at me, I looking at you.</p>
<p>Qiao said, (If she dies, I won't live either. She went to the Hummels' house every day, how did I not know? I should have gone.) Meg said, (That's not your fault, it's my fault. I'm the oldest, I promised Mama I would take care of you.) She bit her lip, with infinite pain in her heart… But should they send a telegram to Mama? They called Hannah and discussed it with her. Hannah opposed sending a telegram. She said, (Mama definitely can't leave your father. If she receives your telegram, wouldn't it make her anxious to death?) They had no choice but to obey Hannah's words.</p>
<p>These days of bleak wind and bitter rain passed day by day. On the one hand, they were worried about their father in the distance, and on the other hand, they were afraid of their most beloved sister in front of them. Later, a telegram from Washington said that their father's condition had improved, but it still could not alleviate their sorrow, because Beth's condition became more and more serious day by day, to the point that Meg and Qiao dared not look at each other, because each person had a kind of terror hidden in their hearts, fearing that others would see it. The doctor's face also became more and more serious day by day. One day, he couldn't help it. He said, (If Mrs. March can temporarily leave her husband, we had better send a telegram to ask her to come back.) Hannah wrung her hands painfully, saying, (It's all my fault for telling them not to send a telegram. They wanted to send it a long time ago.) As for Qiao and Meg, at this moment, they hugged each other and trembled. They went downstairs to see the doctor off, passing through the living room, which used to be a place of laughter and entertainment, but now it was silent and desolate. They looked around, silent, but heard the rain pattering outside the window, hitting the glass, making them cry sadly. (To be continued)</p>
