<p>政府派員清查抗日捐欵之不容稍緩梓</p>
<p>自李杜將軍之「世電」及「寒代電」發表以後。抗日捐欵收支疑問之事件。乃暴露一種新趨勢。朱慶瀾氏在此新趨勢進展中。一時成爲疑謗之中心雖眞相如何可以事實爲證明。而社會信仰。終不免有所影響。吾人對於此新趨勢之暴露。一方面爲抗日捐欵前途發生憂慮。一方面則轉爲捐欵收支之清查。喜其較易着手也。蓋三週以前所傳之消息。爲巨數之捐欵中實際交付於抗日將領者僅屬少數。未交之欵。着落如何。關係方面頗多。欲事清查殊屬困難。社會疑竇大有不易打破之勢。是以吾人當時曾提議由經手收匯捐欵各機關。速起而爲自動之總檢查。此種提議。非不顧及其他之疑難。特欲眞相之速明人心之速定。不得不以此求簡捷易行耳。今則彼時消息中之標。已漸清楚。李氏復朱之「世代電」中。有「一年以來所聞於先生者頗多疑惑」一語。假使此項疑惑。即爲問題發生之根源。則即就身受疑謗之朱氏所經手者。檢查明白。如果來去分明未有弊端。社會之信。仰可以及早恢復。爲將來國家社會有事時之募捐。稍留地步。如果查有可疑。則責在一人。亦可掃清彌漫社會之惡空氣。政府旣受社會團體及經手捐欵者之請求。亟亟選派爲國人所信仰之廉正大員。負責清查。以明是非也。</p>
<p>且抗日捐之支用。係屬兩國敵對時之一種非常用欵。其中除顯有情弊者外。有若干部分。暫時應保守秘密。此爲不得已之事。今抗日捐欵用途疑問事件。社會及關係方面。空氣日益緊張。輿論沸騰。詰難紛起。經手捐欵之人。爲求自身乾凈計。無意中洩其秘密於外。或所難免。此在今日。雖無十分重大關係。究嫌時機未至。易於引起他種糾紛。朱慶瀾復李杜電。查良釗對新聞記者談話。已露不能自持之端。循是以往。必且更甚。政府在今日。旣須阻止秘密之洩漏。更不得不防有人藉秘密以掩護其弊端。派員清查。誠不容稍緩矣。</p>

<p>彭夫太平洋學會開會時、日本政策兩次被攻擊、其一爲日本商業之競爭、其一爲滿洲問題、關於第一問題、英國代表指斥日本工業、謂其獎勵不正當競爭、以謀奪职世界巿塲、英代表謂日本工資低廉、旣使他國工業處於不平等地位、而政府復對生產者與以獎勵、又乘日圓跌落之時機、在金融巿塲上下其手、以圖漁利云云、討論滿洲問題時、辯論尤烈、所最感興趣者、即赴會之日本各代表亦僅在本身責任範圍以内發言、謂「滿洲國」絶不至成爲日本之殖民地、並謂日本人口過剩、其隱患當以日本工業逐漸發逹之法消弭之、而以滿洲爲日本工業之原料儲藏所云、中國代表起立答辯、謂人口過剩、在日本毎年不過一百萬、而中國則爲四百五十萬、故應謀出路者乃中國、非日本也云云、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>彭夫太平洋學會日代表髙橋宣言云、「西方諸國以日本出產、因手工低廉之故、售價甚廉、故紛紛提髙關稅以抵制之、顧時局愈嚴重、則日本工資愈廉、唯一解决之道、端在以正當競爭爲基礎而成立妥協」云云、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>將失敗、蓋其計劃本身之組織、需膨脹通貨以爲之輔、渠未見有他種成功途徑、故美金元應在安定與膨脹兩方面兼籌並顧、又謂渠之所言、不過就經濟復興計劃預料其趨勢而已、並非建議膨脹貨幣、且渠平素固主張穩定貨幣、認貨幣不穩定後、買賣兩方倶有莫知適從之虞、而他國政府亦不得不加髙關稅、以資保護、且貨幣不穩定、並可引起貨物之傾銷、其種種影響、皆不利於國際貿易云、（十七日國民電）</p>

<p>發表談話</p>
<p>中央社云、中央政治會議秘書長唐有壬氏、前隨汪院長由廬返京、前晚搭夜車來滬、昨晨八時許抵此、中央社記者晤及唐氏於其禹邸、作下列之談話、</p>
<p>外羅赴新任務據唐氏談、新疆地處邊陲、頗關重要、兼之該地復多種族之分歧、宗敎信仰之各異情形異常複雜、列强對之、虎視耽耽、各施技倆、復乘種族及宗敎信仰各別之四點、挑撥操縱、以遂其侵略之野心、中央目睹新疆之隱憂、更以交通不便、消息隔膜、故特派羅部長出巡新疆、視察西北之情况、以作開發之準備、而免將來之大患　、在羅部長出巡期内、外交部部長一職、暫由汪院長兼署、一俟羅部長返京、仍行交卸、外傳羅部長將專任司法行政部部長、外長則由汪院長長期兼署之說、並非事實、本人將調任外次之說、亦非確詞、至於羅部長何日首途出巡、目前尙難確定、</p>
<p>馮有入京可能　察局現已和平解决、惟一切善後事宜、頗感棘手、對於軍隊之整理與改編、尤覺困難馮玉祥氏現已到逹濟南有入京之可能、至於中央將予馮氏以何種名義、刻尙未定、但决非軍職華北戰區、業已接收完竣、惟盜匪如毛行政困難、前途未可樂觀</p>
<p>美棉美麥用途　美棉美麥之用途、廬山會議中、業已决定、完全作爲建設費用、至於支配問題、須待宋部長回國之後、再行决定、外傳美棉一部份售與日商之說以商業之目光觀之、似屬可能、然以政治之目光觀之、則决非事實、</p>
<p>召開五全代會　第五次全國代表大會、决如期召開、聞西南方面曾電京表示反對、惟本人並未目睹電文、至於外傳西南亦將在粤同時召開五全代會之說、决難成爲事實、蓋陳濟棠氏對此曾力加反對也、</p>
<p>張學良暫不返　外電傳稱張學良氏將於十一月前返國、中央方面、將畀以航空署要職等云云、唐氏力闢此說不確、且謂汪蔣在廬山會晤時、對於張氏返國事宜、曾加以討論、均主張請張氏留居國外、作長時間之考察、業將該意電逹張氏矣、至陳銘樞氏將任五省東路勦匪總司令之說、前曾聞之、惟目前進展至若何程度、則不甚清楚、</p>
<p>法佔九島事件　關於法國强佔九小島事、中央現尙在調查中、至於該九小島之名稱及地位、據目下所知、似非西沙羣島中之小島、故現已嚴密調查、惟此項工作、殊爲困難、外部一俟調查明白後、如確係我國領土、當嚴重向法提出抗議、至於日傳該九小島係日方領土、絶無根據、</p>

<p>本市消防狀况</p>
<p>閘北區較戰前更有進步</p>
<p>市中心區擬定初步計劃</p>
<p>本市消防建設、向甚注意、雖一二八案發生後、所有閘北·江灣·吳淞·等區救火會、均遭極大損失、但最近已恢復原狀、中央社記者特往市公安局、叩詢關於本市消防近况、茲據該局消防股主任董致和詳述如下、</p>
<p>閘北恢復原狀</p>
<p>本市消防工作、原以閘北一區最有成績、自滬戰後、雖遭巨創、但現已恢復原狀、且較前更有進步、閘北一區分爲四段、其中三段救火會器械精良、技術純熟、實爲上海首屈一指、該段救火會原有帮浦救火車五輛、近復訂購英國之最新式帮浦車一輛價値在五萬元左右、車上裝有六十尺高之機梯、故雖最髙房屋失火、該段救火會亦可往救、又閘北救火聯合會近添購救護車一輛、設備亦極精緻、專備火災時遭難者之救護工作、自試用以來、成績極佳、</p>
<p>各區逐步擴充</p>
<p>至於滬南區仍保持常態、髙橋洋涇二區、因種種關係、仍用舊式消防器械、但該局正在設法積極擴充革新中、浦東之爛泥渡、人口稠密、火患迭起、所用消防器具、雖較上述兩區完備、但以給水不便、尙不能收巨效、吳淞一區、在一二八案中原有消防設備、幾盡燬滅、但現已新購新式帮浦救火車一輛、皮帶一千餘尺、將來逐步擴充、市中心區之消防、現亦在籌劃中、但以市庫支絀、故初步計劃、祇能因陋就簡、現於各公路有水管處、先行裝置消防龍頭、再謀在該區組織消防隊、將來並擬於閘北區調出一部份消防器械及救火人員、在該區服務、另由市府撥給數千元、以備添置其他必不可少之用具、</p>
<p>取締居户縱火</p>
<p>本市因華洋雜處、人心不齊、毎有故意縱火、藉圖非分之財、故本局現已擬具火險户登記規則、嚴防此種流弊、如有此種事件發生、當嚴予制裁、該項規則、現經呈請</p>
<p>市府核示、再本市有所謂某某公估行、乃受保險公司之委託、毎於保險各户遇火險時、輙由西人領導若干小工、前往火塲搶搬户内物件、但此事往往誤搬非保險户之物件、甚至有阻礙救火工作者、故本局近復訂定公估行火塲收拾規則、加以限制、一俟市府核准公布、當即實行</p>
<p>神户華婦密販金條</p>
<h3 id="c149">被經手人鯨呑 <a href="#c149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>値價一萬六千元之金條</p>
<p>僅售得七千四百元分肥</p>
<p>｜各關係人先後逮獲｜</p>
<p>有婦人黃江氏、向在日本神户開設料理店、積資成富、邇因日本禁金出口、金價較他處低廉、該婦遂秘密販賣金條、藉圖厚利、本年六月二十九日、美商大來洋行世界班輪「海斯」號自神户起椗、航行來滬、黃江氏曾將價値一萬六千元之金條七根、託該船打字職員趙春寳携帶赴滬、命其交給諸阿才收受、七月三日、海斯號輪船抵埠、詎趙頓起貪心、竟將該項金貨</p>
<p>與馮某及住居新唐家弄三百四十三號之六旬老嫗季李氏等鯨呑、由嫗之夫季春卷私行盜賣、得價七千四百元分肥、最近黃江氏得悉、乃託與趙春寳同事之衡榮寳調查、由衡訪知趙避匿城内地方廳路、特於前日報告市公安局、派領班偵探顧連城、率同探員胡葵生·貢富金·等馳往、將趙拏獲、因據其供馮某亦與季李氏同屋而居、顧探員等當投匯司捕房、加派包探季秀全按址往拏、但馮已聞風逃避、祗將季李氏拘獲、昨解第一特區地方法院、由劉毓桂推事提審、顧探員帶同趙犯到庭、聲請准其將季李氏一併提回公安局查究、惟捕房律師王耀堂則請將該氏暫予覊押、謂因本案内容、極其複雜、不僅金條糾葛、恐尙有拐賣人口關係、故捕房須詳細偵查、且公安局要求移提、今亦無公函到院、手續猶屬欠缺、應請將季李氏發押、以便着手調查云云、劉推事遂諭准予覊押、改期七天、候公安局來文再行核辦、</p>

<p>｜今日下午爲雙打共兩組比賽｜</p>
<p>上海萬國網球扶輪杯複賽、於昨日在中華會球場開始、觀者二三百人、與賽者爲中華對美國、日本對葡萄牙、共單打四組、中美之戰、係一面倒形勢、兩組均屬中華勝利、日葡之役、勢均力敵、各勝單打一組、且日本町田對葡萄牙Ｈ柯拉沙、經五盤劇戰、始分勝負、町田因力竭而敗、今日爲雙打比賽、日葡於三時起賽、中美四時開始、地點仍在中華會、詳情分誌如下、</p>
<p>▲中華兩勝美國▲</p>
<h3 id="c173">▲鄭兆佳勝史規亞 <a href="#c173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>是組於三時起賽、小鄭香勝第一第二兩盤、殊見容易、比較均爲六比一、史規亞發球、屢出雙失誤、减少其原有威風、而鄭兆佳虎虎有生氣、能减少失誤、運用智力取勝、配以强烈之抽擊、顯示其球藝已有相當進步、惟第三盤鄭竟以一比六失敗、誠令人奇怪、减却觀衆之信仰心、在鄭或以爲勝利有把握、而固意延長比賽、以滿足其「網球慾」乎、第四盤一氣呵成五局、且第五局上、鄭發球、曾先負○｜四十、而後竟連勝五記奪回是局、殊非容易、第六局鄭固意將球打入網中、奉送一局、但以下兩局竟爲史規亞連勝、終成六比三終、</p>

<p>王文正勝史密斯</p>
<p>是組於四時半與日葡兩單打同時舉行、爲觀者視線之的、然王君竟放縱其穩健老實之態度、傲謾輕敵、以博取觀者之呌好、不能不爲王君惜、王君已爲目下之第一流選手、應注意網球爲君子之爭、幸王君勉之、至於二人之比賽、史密斯固遠非王文正之敵、欲以十八局連勝、亦屬可能之事、但爲使對手不過分難堪、王特放送六局、其結果如下、</p>

<p>柯拉沙與町田、　　二人球藝、可稱勢均力敵、軒輊難分、町田如不能以直落三勝柯拉沙、則必爲柯拉沙所敗、因町田體質軟弱、不善久戰、而柯拉沙爲海上著名之騎師、身體堅强、奔跑迅速、富於長力、五盤結束、柯拉沙仍無倦態、無論長短遠近之球、柯均能救出、惟管束力尙欠把握、觸網及出界球甚多、町田勝第一第三兩盤、第四盤柯拉沙以六比一勝、第五盤町田取首局外、又連負六局、蓋町田已氣力不濟、疲於奔命矣、</p>

<p>日葡另一組單打爲須藤對馬賽爾、須藤用牛皮筋之抽球、使馬賽爾應付不睱、用力則球毎出界、軟抽則不能勝敵、上網攔截、亦無把握第一第三盤形勢較爲平均、然馬賽爾終無取勝機會、第二盤須藤得之甚易、比較如下、</p>

<h3 id="c181">勇氣的太多和太少 <a href="#c181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— 珮瑜</p>
<p>「過與不及」是不好的，「太多」和「太少」是不好的。究竟那一樣更壞，「過」與「太多」呢，抑是「不及」與「太少？」那是很難斷定的。大多數的人總是這樣想：「不及」與「太少」。比較更壞些。</p>
<p>這種見解不能讚美的！勇氣太少了！這是我們中間許多人的呼聲。張三先生要做一個藝術家，但是他的父親反對，强迫他去做一個工程師。假使他做工程師而失敗，他便會有「若做藝術家一定飛黃腾逹」的自嘲自慰。李四小姐要做一個歌舞家，但是被伊的家庭阻止，不克如願以償，以致埋沒了伊的天才。在這種情形之下，確是「太少」比較更壞些．</p>
<p>其實「太多」未必少壞，尤其是關於勇氣方面的．勇氣太多了，易使固有的志願毁滅無餘。「太多」的壞處比「太少」的壞處，不知要大幾倍多幾倍咧！別人不敢謀害岳飛，秦檜却大敢而特敢；別人不想稱孤道寡，袁世凱却一股大勇氣；別人沒有勇氣去簽訂喪權辱國的條約，李鴻章却勇氣多得不能遏止。在這種情形之下，確是「太多」比較更壞些。</p>
<p>抗禦暴敵，衝鋒陷陣，這種勇氣，只嫌它「太少」，不嫌它「太多」，忍辱含垢，不肯奮進，這種勇氣只嫌它「太多」，不嫌它「太少」。所以在國家大事方面請，執政者的勇氣，與其「太多」，倒不如「太少」。勇氣太少，至多給人駡一聲「尸位素餐」；勇氣太多，難免要有「遺臭萬年」的惡名。</p>
<p>假使要說句千眞萬確的話，應當這樣：做福國利民的大事，勇氣要「太多」做禍國殃民的勾當，勇氣要「太少」；這才是做官的座右銘。</p>

<p>老友聞君野鶴，他自從民十五那年脫離了新聞界記者生活，改入敎育界以後，海上文壇，久已沒瞧見他的作品。除了少數新知舊雨，和君很有交誼的，知道他近年的行藏外，旁的人知道的恐是很少吧！實則他近幾年來南往百粤，北上平津，在黑板和粉筆生活下誘掖莘莘學子之外，他仍是在孜孜不倦的研究學問。他是和梁新會先生一樣的有學問慾者的學者，所以對於中國文學範圍裏某一種有不知的，沒有不窮極原委，以期盡知而後已。他本來最喜歡研討音韻龜甲等之古文學，最近又研究和音韵學有關的各地語言學。幾天以前，他忽地寫了一封信給我，要我給他介紹灌音。我想老友向不喜音樂戲曲，此刻怎地要灌音呢？後來我約定了日子，請他到寓所後，再會同前往。那天除了君之外，還來了一位姓孔的，據說是君之髙足。（便是奈何集的作者）一位是姓雲的。攀談了一回，方知君要灌的音，乃是暹羅語言上用的許多暹羅字母。這位雲先生，便是暹羅人，野鶴因爲不久須往北平講學，而那暹羅字母聲音很是難記，所以請雲先生把字母的發音，特地灌入唱片，以備他日研究的資料。君之富於研究精神，由此可見一斑，所以我把它記在上面。</p>

<p>小工藝</p>
<h3 id="c186">家庭簡便染料 <a href="#c186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— 冰玉</p>
<p>當化學工藝沒有發逹的時候，完全用原始的植物性染料，就是把草木的花果皮根等，煮出各種顏色，以爲染色之用。到了現在化學工藝進步，一切染料，差不多是化學性的，而植物性染料的使用方法，幾乎要失傳了。可是植物性的染料，實在比化學性染料爲幽雅文凈，而且不會褪色。所以近年來，又有提倡原始的植物性染料，現在我把各種植物變成的色彩，與染色的方法，簡單的說一下。</p>
<p>大凡用草木的花，皮，根，實等植物原料的汁印染布草，手續上雖然比較複雜，但是染色的雅緻，以及與日光洗濯的關係，究竟非化學</p>
<p>染料所能及的。惟所染的顏色，侬草木的種類而不同。最普通的如㈠茜草的根，紅花的花，蘇梗的枝幹，梅的枝幹，丹皮等，用水煮出的汁，都可以染紅色。㈡刈安草，黃柏的樹皮，梔子的實，鬱金的根，杮的子等，用水煮出的汁，可以染黃色。㈢榛樹的果皮，胡桃的果皮，栗的果皮，楊梅的樹皮，亞仙與咖啡的子，矢車的實，紅茶等，用水煮出的汁，可以染茶色。㈣藍的樹皮，蓬與梨的樹皮等，可染靑色。㈤紫草的根，五倍子等，可染紫色。㈥五倍子，栗花，桑木，黑豆，山樱的樹皮等，可染鼠色。㈦紺藍，漆樹的葉，櫟的嫩葉，矢車的實，可染黑色。但是這等染料，不宜單獨使用，往往混用媒介染藥，才能入色。</p>
<p>媒介染藥的原料是用明礬，灰汁，石灰，鐵。重克羅姆酸，阿爾密尼姆（軟而輕的一種白色金屬）克羅姆，錫，稻草灰等物。染的方法，依所染的東西又不同的。譬如染布與染皮革時，須先在媒介染藥中浸過一晝夜，然後取出，再用水漂清，浸在亞爾加里ＡＬＫＡＬＩ，（卽溶化於水的鹽基）溶液中，使媒介染藥，不會脫落，然後放入所染的顏色中，倘若要印花，當浸過媒介染藥以後，就在上面敷蠟，再浸入染料中，那末，染料就因固定的媒介染藥的作用，變成各色各樣了。這裏最要注意的，就是用媒介染藥時，應當充分的浸透，而且浸過後，要充分的洗凈，照這樣，染色不會游離，大約染料中浸了十分鍾，再用肥皂溶在開水内，使蠟溶去，這時顏色就固定不變了。倘若我們要把同種顏色，分出濃淡，那須就媒介染藥的種類而分別的，假使我們應用得巧妙，就顯出很好看的色彩。譬如明礬爲最鮮明的顏色，鐵則能現出深暗之色，若是用咖啡實煮出的汁印染時，最初可用明礬爲媒介染藥，先變成白茶色，再用石灰爲媒介染藥，變爲稍深的茶色，如再用硫酸銅溶液爲媒介染藥時，變爲帶灰色的茶色，最後用鐵爲媒介染藥時，變爲帶黑色的茶色，就是成爲咖啡的色彩了。所以依照模樣，留於色上的蠟，漸漸因媒介染藥的使用手續，存同一色彩中，可以分出濃淡深淺的。這種染法，手續雖然麻煩，可是比化學染料染成的顏色，具有獨特的異彩。至於染色的器具，以用陶器爲宜，染皮革時，可用坦銀ＴＡＮＮＩＮ或克羅姆ＣＨＲＯＭＩＵＭ，那雖久曝日光，也不會褪色的。其他用薔薇花作染料時，可用阿尼林Aniline的黑奈夫德爾ＮＡＰＨＴＡＬＢ的溶液中，浸以有莖的白薔薇花，就變成灰色或淡黑色，染料的配合，卽染料八分之一盎司，與水三合二勺混合，最爲適宜。</p>

<h3 id="c189">交流機收音低弱之原因及其治法 <a href="#c189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— 一知</p>
<p>一具交流機，買來或裝配時往往音調響亮，很是滿意，但用了若干時後，聲調會漸漸低弱，這個原因，約有下列數端。</p>
<p>㈠由於眞空管方面的電子管使用日久，發射電子效率大减，電子管爲無綫電機中之靈魂，猶人身中之腦部，主腦失去其靈敏的知覺，收音效率自然大减了。遇着這種弊病，祇有將電子管換新的或施用復活法，還有電子管因繼續使用時間太久，致發生髙熱，管内電子的發射，超出規定範圍之外，收音效率亦减。遇此弊病，應速將該機停止使用，俟電子管冷後再行啓用。</p>
<p>㈡由於變壓器方面的强力變壓器，連續使用，銅綫及鐵片皆發生髙熱，因之銅綫電阻加增；鐵片磁阻亦增。若鐵片上渦流耗（ＥＤＤＹ　ＣＵＲＥＮＴ　ＬＯＳＳ）與磁蹄耗（ＨＹＳＴＥＲＳＩＳ　ＬＯＳＳ）大增，則變壓器即受無形的大消耗，致輪出負載電力大减。收音機電力不足，怎能使收音有優美的成績呢？</p>
<p>㈢由於電容器方面的電液式濾波的，或絶緣不佳的電容器，使用日久，灰塵堆積，在潮濕天氣，易致一部分電力跨越而過，因此，所需電壓，流去一部，電力遂感不足，聲音自然减弱。</p>
<p>㈣由於電阻器方面的碳質的電阻器，不耐髙熱度，使用過久，熱度上增不已，電阻亦繼續上增不已，電阻大，通過電流遂小，電子管不得適當之電流，收音效率爲之大减。</p>
<p>㈤由於音量控制器方面的音量控制器（ＶＯＬＵＭＥＧＲＡＤ）皆以碳質粉屑塗於絶緣體上，圍成圓形，用活動桿調節；有時使用日久，碳屑受摩擦减少，電阻加增，聲音低弱。</p>
<p>㈥由於接綫方面的接綫不妥，日久鬆弛，兩導體接觸面積减小，電阻加增，收音亦會低弱。</p>
<p>綜上所述：交流機收音低弱之原因，由於㈠繼續使用時間太久，眞空管，變壓器，電阻器，超出牠們指定的溫度，而失却效用；㈡灰塵堆積，濕氣侵入，致有漏電發生；㈢機件構造不良。所以我們使用時應該注意；㈠勿開放過久，最好毎使用一二小時後關閉二三分鐘；㈡勿置潮濕地方，勿使灰塵侵入，經過數月後，把内部所積的灰塵吹散，㈢各項機件，勿貪一時便宜而購劣貨，否則將來得不償失。對於接綫須注意，應用錫銲固，乃可一勞永逸。</p>
<h3 id="c190">一個改良的再生綫路 <a href="#c190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— 石華玉</p>
<p>在我們設計一隻短波機的時候，最困難的事，就是用普通再生圈引起的振盪不能十分平穩。我們現在把再生圈廢去，用附圖的線路。那末就可以得到好的効果了。這線路祇用一個插入線圈Ｌ，所以改變波長很便當，自十幾米突起至廣播波長帶都可應用。圖中用聽筒或低週率變壓器的初級形成栅路與屏路之交連，故產生再生力者不爲普通再生圈或可變電容器而爲阻力也。再次天線亦如普通方法用電容交連，不過Ｃ２之功用有二：一再生力可發生於極寛之調節範圍内，二使調節線路祇有一自感量，總之此線路之優點，在祇用一綫圈之變換而能收各種之波長也。</p>
<h3 id="c191">短波發射機之調準及其步驟（續） <a href="#c191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— 羅靜予</p>
<p>上篇單振盪式調準之原理及其步驟</p>
<p>單振盪式中文譯名又呌做自制式，包括哈特來（ＨＡＲＴＬＹ）屏栅諧振（Ｔ·Ｐ·Ｔ·Ｇ·｜ＴＵＮＥＤ　ＰＬＡＴＥ　ＧＲＩＤ）考畢茲（ＣＯＬＰＩＴＴＳ）三種主要線路。由其配合的方法又分做感應交連（ＬＮＤＵＣＴＩＶＥ　ＣＯＵＰＬＩＮＧ）和電容量交連（ＣＡＰＡＣＩＴＶＥ　ＣＯＵＰＩＮＧ）兩類，不過，配合的方法雖是有着這樣的類別，目的却都是一樣，同是把屏極電流回抵栅極，求他發生振盪。</p>
<p>單振盪式調準的步驟若瑣碎講來，自然很多，不過大槪的分劃可以分做下列五個階段：</p>
<p>㈠設若我們某一種卽定的線路，已將所有的設備構成，（三種主要線路在（三）段時當分別詳論）那嗎，我們第一點須檢查的便是各項裝設的地位是否合宜，第二點便是各種接線是否堅牢可靠，第三點便是所用線圈是否和我們預定的波長相符。其次</p>
<p>㈡燃點燈絲至額定的電壓。倘若在溫度較低的季節，最好讓燈絲獨自燃着一二分鐘，使他的熱量充足後，再加上屏極電壓。（這種情形在舊式鐺製眞空管裏，尤其注重：因該式眞空管非逹最髙的熱度不會有電子由燈絲飛出的。）絲極的電壓在調準的進程中，有時候我們也可以略略變動的：不過太髙則眞空管易損，太低不易發生振盪。至於屏極電壓在調準時，通常可以髙出額定數之一半，甚至可以髙到三分之二弱。譬如我們用五十瓦特的眞空管大多用到五百或六百弗打。二百五十瓦特的眞空管可用到一千或一千二三百弗打。然後</p>
<p>㈢再調準盪線路。其法先將天線撤去，或者將天線線圈作極疏的交連後，再着手於振盪線路的調準工作。又因爲有感應交連及電容量交連的分別，所以調準振盪線路的手續也各有不同，現在特分叙於後。不過在未起述之前，我們不得不先要明白，調準振盪情形的好壞，亦即命定此機本身效率的好壞。而所謂好的振盪情形，在前面已經講過，就是要屏流達到最小的限度：故我們上下變更線圈的圈數（如哈特來）或移動電容器的度數（如考畢茲等），當停定於某點時，其兩傍的位置，都是以增大屏流的記數的：則此停定的某點，即爲振盪情形最佳的標準點，當然的，這種情形也可以說是表明此機本身效率的最髙點。（未完）</p>
<h3 id="c192">怎樣調節最低音部（續） <a href="#c192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— 官質冰</p>
<p>我說的是音調問題，所以再把這兩個電台的音調來說說：如果試聽ＸＣＢＬ時，它發出的最低音部僅逹於蓬！蓬！蓬！而止；並且還似乎欠一點回聲，但是聽ＺＭＨＹ呢，在蓬！蓬！蓬！之下，還可以聽得來洪！洪！洪！的音調，而在此洪！洪！洪！的音調之下，更有不知底止的餘隙容積，好像有立在髙山之上而下臨深淵，欲其髙則直上靑霄，欲其低則沉之不測深淵的情境。</p>
<p>現在歸到本題來說話，究竟最低音部是怎樣被截去的呢？如何才可以調節最低音部。從前段說來，音調的好壞全在低週率放大器上，已無疑議，但是同是一部機器，稍一變更其調節，即可截斷與獲得最低音部的可能，這似乎在調節上更須注意。據作者的推測，一般調節的人，毎毎感覺音調不夠響，即專注意於低週放大之最後兩級或許加兩級放大，如果感覺得過於響亮，則控制多半在最後兩級，或在拾音器級之控制器上去控制，這樣，便於不知不覺中放大了髙音部而截去了低音部。</p>
<p>經騐告訴我，欲調節最低音部，須</p>
<p>儘量的放大低週放大器之最初兩級，尤其注意於拾音級，務使其原音儘量的不失眞的放出，但亦不可過於放大而致失眞，或又截去了最髙音部。</p>
<p>我現在將我的機器綫路圖畫在上面　　當將Ａ部儘量放　　大而將Ｂ部減小時，　　可得最低音部，但反　　是，若將Ｂ部放大，　　Ａ部减小時，最低音　　部即截去無聞。所以　　我覺得低週放大器須　　將最初兩級儘量放大　　而不可增多耗阻，致　　截去其最低音部。　　我寫在上面的這篇文字，特供研究無線電諸同人之参照，並希於試騐後加以補充或指正，那就更好了。（完）</p>

<p>（十三）配諧電路（ＴＵＮＩＮＧ　ＣＩＣＵＩＴ）</p>
<p>㈠配諧之意義：欲知配諧電路之功用，當先明配諧之爲何物，與其所獨具之性質若何。茲舉一圖以明其意：第一圖爲由電容器Ｃ，綫圈Ｌ，耗阻Ｒ而成之電路，如在此電路間接一交流電源，則電流必往還流通於其間。此時如將交流電源之週率一一變換其値，至適當之週率時，則流通於電路間之電流爲最强大。凡此種現象之發生稱曰配諧，而此時電源所具有之週率稱曰配諧週率。如使電源之週率一定不變，而增减電路中之電容量Ｃ或自感量Ｌ，亦能調節電流最强大之點，此種現象亦屬配諧。</p>
<p>㈡配諧週率與ＣＬ之關係：茲設Ｆ爲配諧週率，其單位爲千週（ＫＣ）；Ｃ爲電容量，其單位爲買克羅法拉特（ＭＦ）；Ｌ爲自感量，其單位爲買克羅亨利（ＭＨ）；如Ｆ與ＣＬ之間有下列之關係時，則發生配諧現象。</p>
<p>而其配諧波長入（單位米突）即爲</p>
<p>㈢收音機之配諧電路：收音機之配諧電路係由電容器與線圈而成，爲收音機之主要門户，凡外來電波均須經此門户而入，將電容器之電容量一一變換其値，則能選擇所欲接收之外來波長。而配諧波長之範圍係由電容量與自感量兩者之配合而定。目下廣播用之波長範圍爲由二百米突至五百四五十米突，故欲適合該波長範圍，自應適當選定變量電容器之片數，與綫圈之轉數。關於選定之法容當另篇詳述之。</p>
<p>Ｉ｜千分安培</p>
<p>Ｆ｜週率</p>
<p>Ｅ電壓（弗打）</p>
<p>例如第三圖設測得電流　　爲八十三千分安培，依　　上式得電容量爲：　　（近似値）</p>
<p>依上述二法測得之電容量，約有百分之五上下。（例如ＩＭＦＤ之電容器測得之數値爲１、０５ＭＦＤ、相差甚微，在實用上並無妨得）</p>
<p>電容器在未曾測量之前，必須先設法試騐該電容器確未損壞或短路。否則電表及保險絲均有焚毁之虞，這一點是要特別注意的。</p>

<h3 id="c197">頭痛醫脚論 <a href="#c197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— 豈凡</p>
<p>有許多道理，的確是不易理解，道理愈是奥妙，理解愈是不易。中國是世界上最古的國家，此種奥妙的道理更特別多。　　自從西醫的生意日漸興旺，中國舊醫的生路日感壓迫之後，新舊醫界之爭遂起，爲生存而競爭也。於是有了國醫的名稱，國醫是同國學一樣性質的，說其不能存在就沒有，主張其可以存在，就有了不少奥妙之理，而確實可以令人深信其存在的。</p>
<p>有若干國醫也喜用西藥，治梅毒用六零六，治瘧疾用金鷄納霜，表散用阿斯匹靈，清胃用小蘇打等等，但口上的說話，還保持他是國醫的本色，五行生尅，君臣佐使，談得頭頭是道的。那就是中學爲體，西學爲用，結果如何，已在史册。</p>
<p>後來國醫知道自已理論太深奥而不易爲人們懂得，於是放棄了自已的理論，而起來攻擊西醫理論的不精深。他們說，西醫只知頭痛醫頭，脚痛醫脚，並無根本的澈底的辦法，須知人生一體，在在相關，疾病之發，有其所受病之根本所在，治其本，斯可矣。這一篇大道理，無懈可擊，博得不少人的信仰，於是國醫復活，復興國醫的呼聲，又髙號起來了。</p>
<p>有若干人，明白了頭痛醫頭脚痛醫脚的不合醫道，於是恍然大悟曰：頭痛一定是要醫脚的了。他們便照這辦法來行醫行事，對於一切設施處置，都貫澈這宗旨，一時人心激發，沸沸揚揚，但其結果和何，却還未見分曉，因其正在構成史實也。</p>

<p>自由談先後的指出了「推」和「踢」兩種現象。無論推也罷，踢也罷，兩者雖以情勢與對象而有使用的不同，但本質與作用還是一樣的。</p>
<p>從推和踢，又可聯想到與此相應發生的另一現象，但這一現象的本身是和推踢兩者相反的，那就是「拉」。這不僅存在於我們的想像中，而且存在於平凡的事實中。對於一扇大門或是窗户，通常就有「推」「拉」二重現象。假如不願用手的話，也可用足踢開，用足勾上。自然，粗陋的門窗纔可踢或勾，華貴的門窗祇能推或拉。</p>
<p>單祇有推或踢，是不行的。門窗推了不拉，就不能再推了。新式門窗雖推開能自行關上，但這顯係對於推而類於拉的一種反響。爲要避免這反響的震動，最好還是順手拉住，以殺其勢。要繼續推，需得一方面拉。拉了，推的作用纔顯。踢也一樣。推踢兩者，和拉是相反而又相成的。</p>
<p>滿族入主中國，拉住漢族的士大夫，爲的是穩定新得的推和踢的特權。拉是單方面拉不起來的，漢族的士大夫自然也樂於去拉新勝的滿族，爲的是維持固有的推和踢的地位。究竟誰先拉？那可不知道。總之，凡操有推和踢的權位者，都有拉的資格，拉的可能，拉的必要。</p>
<p>小百姓是不配拉的，反之，却有被推被踢的「分」。這是因爲「刑不上大夫，禮不下庶人」。假如小百姓也可拉的話，那就是軍事時期的「拉夫」。被推被踢者因推者踢者的相推相踢而嘗到了拉的滋味。</p>
<p>太平天國革命，滿族拉漢族士大夫，漢族士大夫又拉華爾戈登白齊文，演了一齣「三拉團圓」，結果太平天國被踢倒了。</p>
<p>現在這齣喜劇又在東北角上出現，一端據說是同文同種的日本，一端是業經五族共和的滿漢。這是最露骨的一例。</p>
<p>由拉的觀點看，時代在逆轉，歷史在反覆。</p>
<h3 id="c200">從「大悲寺外」談所謂敎育小說 <a href="#c200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— 侍桁</p>
<p>八月十日的「自由談」上，鳳吾先生寫了一篇文章，是由老舍先生的近作而論敎育小說的。敎育小說這名詞，不只在鳳吾先生，許多人都是不能給它以明確和槪念的，因爲一切的小說不管是意識地或是無意識地，全是在作着敎育的工作，如果說凡是描寫與敎育界有關的小說，才是敎育的小說，那定義又未免太狹；但如</p>
<p>果說凡是帶着濃厚的敎育意識的一切小說，全部都可以成爲敎育小說，那定義又未免太廣。無論鳳吾先生對於這定義是怎樣想的，他之以「大悲寺外」而論敎育小說的推論是錯誤了的。</p>
<p>「大悲寺外」（原文載「文藝月刊」四卷一期）稍嚴格地講是不能稱爲敎育小說的，取材雖是從學校生活的師生關係講起，而作者主要的目的，是在描寫兩種典型的人，前半是那位黃學監，後半是那位打死學監的丁庚，兩個人都是特殊典型的人，不能代表一切的學監和一切的學生的，所以他們之間的關係也是極特殊的。如果作者不把黃先生寫成一個學監，不把丁庚寫成一個學生，那人物和故事仍是同樣可以發展下去，因爲作者並沒有要使他們選兩種人和這故事的可能性只有在學校生活中才有可能的那樣的用意。黃學監是被描寫成「善良」的擬人化，而丁庚是他的反面，無疑地老舍先生對於這後者的人型是懷着幾分的嫌惡，但爲使他也露出較深刻的人性，於是就適用了那文學的老套子的良心譴責主義。這種寫法當然是下意識地暴露出所謂小資產階級或知識份子在文學上所玩的花頭，而作者的確沒有想用這種花頭來解决問題的。甚至更退一步講，它都不能說是反映現實的，是有意使人物深刻化而揑造了誇大的事實。</p>
<p>於是鳳吾先生說的「可是這種唯心的自責主義，是不是足以解决問題呢？一點也不能夠。所以，丁庚沒有方法自救，而在敎育上，也沒有用自已譴責解决了糾紛的事。」這段話，便使人覺着有些文不對題了。</p>
<p>在描寫丁庚這人物的前後上，作者有着矛盾了，最初他怎樣描寫丁庚呢？｜你看：「那時的丁庚也不過是十七歲。老穿着小藍布衫，臉上長着小紅疙瘩，眼睛永遠有點水銹，像敷着些眼藥。老實，不好說話，有時候跟他好，有時候又跟你好，有時自動的收拾宿舍，有時候一天不洗臉。所以是小姐｜有點忽東忽西的小件。」這段簡潔營喩的文章，雖是非經生動地描繪出這個小姐的人物，可是想使他其後再轉變成一個永久苦於良心譴責主義那樣深刻的人物，就不免有很大的困難了。作者只以幾個「絶不計較」：「我讓了，决不計較：「我死，决不計較你」：要是你願殺我，請，我决不計較」，這類的話，成了丁庚轉變前後兩人的理由，是不夠的。像這種人物性格的矛盾，才眞是這作品的缺欠。</p>
<p>誠如鳳吾先生所說：「只有嚴肅的態度，而沒有正確的創作方法，是不會收到有力的効果的。」不過這里所謂的「正確的創作方法」却不應該引到良心譴責主義是否能夠解决問題之上去的，「正確的創作方法」和實際上能否解决問題，是毫無關係的事。</p>
<p>所以鳳吾先生第一把「大悲寺外」作爲「敎育小說」而論，已是錯誤，其次把其中表現的良心譴責主義，作爲敎育之一方法，以致問出這種主義是否能解决敎育問題，便更是錯誤的了。本來鳳吾先生那篇短文章，是沒有這樣給以指摘的必要，但是想到這篇文章所犯的毛病，正和我們現今所正流行的觀念論的文藝論所致成的錯誤，完全一樣，而且這種文藝論的方法實在是極有害的，我就不能忍住不講話了。</p>
<h3 id="c201">生命與機械（二） <a href="#c201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— 孫泱</p>
<p>那兩條黑瘦的腿便更加緊張了，汚穢的皮膚下，僅餘的一點點肌肉裏充滿了血液；踏上一步，再站上去。呵，只剩下兩級了，黑瘦的身躯突然開始搖晃，像風裏的蘆葦。牙關咬緊着，伶仃的腿子又提起來，拚命地踏上第二級，突然，在胸膛裡，一股酸麻的東西激動着，死命往上冲，冲進了喉管，冲進了口中；眼前變成了漆黑的一團，階梯，燈光和自已的脚統統不見了，只有數不出那麽多的金色的小點子在黑暗裏飛無。耳朶裡像有億萬的蚊子飛着，雷鳴一般嗡嗡地響。脚子猛地一軟，連人帶包裹，從沒有扶手的階梯邊，摔到底艙的地板上去了。</p>
<p>「怎麽？老張！」後面跟着的一個穿老藍布褲的驚呼一聲，便停着脚，低頭往下望．</p>
<p>「猪玀！你沒有回老家呀！怎麽不動了？」惡駡的聲音和毒蛇似的鞭子又在噪雜混亂的空氣中響了．</p>
<p>穿老藍布褲子的繼續往上爬，脫落的輪齒又重新塡補完整了。　　一個還不曾發育的孩子，赤着全身，在肩上搭着一塊油汚汗膩的布，飛一般從鐵板邊跑到階梯旁，彎下腰細看着：老人安靜地仰臥在地上，兩手攤開，腿子曲着，大的包裏一半擱在他的胸膛上，一半擱在地上。胸膛的深陷的溝渠中，鮮血正懶洋洋的流着。嘴微微張開，一縷血絲還掛在嘴角邊。眼睛睜着，像出水三天的黃花魚，永遠不瞬一瞬。</p>
<p>「怎麽樣啦？小方。」穿老藍布褲子的走下階梯，低聲地問。　　「完了！」那個孩子用黑布揩着額上的汗和眼睛裡的淚，從碎了的心底拼出兩個字。</p>
<p>毒惡的駡聲和鞭子刷過空氣的聲音逐漸靠攏他們了，兩人便互相望一眼，咬一咬牙，又回身工作去了。</p>
<p>「拍！拍！」鞭子毫不留情地落在染血的胸膛上，「喂！別裝死呀！」　　乾枯的臉上沒有一點表情，眉梢都不曾彈動一下，乾鹹魚似的大眼向上翻着，彷彿看見了一個生命以外的目的。乾瘪的嘴張着，那裡面，永遠沒人聲音出來了。</p>
<p>一重陰影掠過香雲紗衫上的黃臉，血絲眼裡射出了凶殘的光；突然，那張臉笑了，笑聲在空氣裡顫動，像深夜的鴟梟，更大的混雜的聲音却像在這剌耳的笑聲裡葬埋了似的。一隻手輕輕動着，鞭子便在空氣裏兜了一個大圈，像三月的風箏後面的絃一般地響着。</p>
<p>「黑狗，小黃！把他用蘆蓆捲起來，扔到江裏去。」無血色的嘴唇惨酷地笑着，雪白的牙齒上泛着罪惡的陰影。</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>江面的夜風帶着凉意和濕氣陣陣飄來，碼頭浸在陰暗的電燈的黑影裡；下面，江水澎湃着，浪頭閃着幽暗的光。大輪船已經滿載着歡樂，憂愁，罪惡和貨物在黃昏時候起椗了。</p>
<p>碼頭的汚穢的地板上，像陳列着臭鹹魚似的躺着許多疲倦的人。背底下，有的用灰黑的破蓆墊着，有的用碎了的布塊墊着，有的從垃圾堆檢來了比較完整的報紙舖在地下，有的就精光着背脊躺在粗糙的地板上。大夥兒和肌肉全是軟綿綿的，頸子像給鐵鎚敲了一下那樣地酸痛。仰面的，沒有勁使自已側臥；側臥的，也不想自討苦吃地去翻過來。本來是什麽樣兒，便永遠是什麽樣兒，只是這一堆臭鹹魚裡，還殘留着生物的觸覺，情感和幻夢。</p>

<p>— 邨人</p>
<p>一個孩子的誕生，他不知道來到這人間要幹些什麽，更不知道他的一生是快樂，是痛苦，他是旣然來了便得生活下去，假如他知道人生的路上并不怎麽容易的走，我想他一定馬上就要絶食求死。　　然而，他的父母，尤其是他的母親，那是愛惜他比較愛惜自已還要强烈，雖然對他也有着一些希望，但就不希望他將來怎麽樣的也有。　　一個人對於的birthday常常李舉行着一種紀念的儀式，據說有兩種意義：一則紀念父母養育之恩，一則紀念自已生存之慶。在這年頭兒，我們窮人逢着birthday，我以爲反而將引起憤恨之感。求生難，做人更至雖，甚至雖生之日猶死之年，對於生存有如雞肋，birthday有什麽可慶可紀念的意義呢？然而，某大文學家因爲逃過了天花這一關，說「眞是洪福齊天，就是毎年開一次慶祝會也不算過分。」對於birthday紀念的意義另外有一種髙明的見解，說是「洪福齊天」，不紀念慶祝便關心不過似的了。這一種髙明的見解，固然令人佩服之至，但也只有「洪福齊天「的人們才有同感吧了。　　「洪福齊天」的人們旣害怕匪綁，也擔心盜刦，一年到頭，提心吊膽地生活着，幸而皇天庇佑一年容易又到了birthday，自然非大地慶祝一下不行。我們窮人呢？身外無長物，兩手是本錢，在業者恐其失業，失業者飢寒交迫，火山上的生活，人什麽慶祝的意義？然而話又得說回來，「天有好生之德」，求生爲人的本性，窮而益堅，生實可慶，富我做壽誕，窮人怎麽不能吃長麵？</p>
<h3 id="c211">爲宗敎而犧牲 <a href="#c211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— 煒</p>
<p>在這樣畸形社會下的整日勞働着的勞工們，感覺到他們的生活是並不應該像機械的呆板，苦燥和繁重。他們覺到應該有一種生命力的「唯太命」來調劑在疲乏得不堪的肉體上得到些樂趣，或者在精神上得到些調養减少些肉體上的痛苦。所以他們拚命的在追求着。</p>
<p>但是呌他們去追求些什麽東西呢？他們時常的碰壁在不良的環境裏。於是他們消極頽廢了。最近在報上又發見了一則新聞爲：一十六歲之學徒爲宗敎而犧牲。這就是從消極而跑入了盲目的途中之一個靑年。</p>
<p>我們首先得知道，那一個自殺的靑年爲一家店中的學徒。學徒的生活有生趣的嗎？當然不會。但是他知道他要追求一點樂趣，可是一個學徒和環境是不能容許你自由發展的。於是他還是跑入那唯心的渺望希望的宗敎底集團中去。加上那一班宣道者拚命的裝出一副救人救苦的慈善臉孔來請他們救主的大道，又其是對於一班白天裏勞働的人們特別地賣力，爲的是那一班勞働的人們迫切的需要一種精神上的補養。在一班沒有多大的敎育思想下的人們感覺到現實的沒有出路，所以在宗敎的宗仰下格外的熱心了。在宗敎的信仰裏呌他們丢開了現在，而去憧憬着將來。記得有一句詩：</p>
<p>百萬衆生且放膽忍受：</p>
<p>且有一個較好的世界來報酬你們！本來宗敎只給他以「吃不着的葡萄」，所以他借了那聖書被撕的動機而自殺了。　　這是誰的錯誤？</p>
<p>最後還是希望能依照蔡元培先生的一句話：「讓藝術代替宗敎」去幹去，而得把大數的羣衆從麻醉中拖出來，走上一個新的大道！</p>

<p>— 因</p>
<p>｜是進步？是沒落？｜</p>
<p>在我們無論談到什麽問題，凡是失望了，在最後使我們啞口無語的時候，我們都說：『這要歸咎於敎育的不普及，以至於民衆智識缺乏之一唯一可靠的補救辦法，就是創辦學校，普及敎育：』　　長蛇般一條ＸＸ路，毎日必有我的履跡。雖然馬路上的細沙，一經風兒的吹掦，早已把我的履跡沒落：困爲毎天走過的緣故，所以ＸＸ路上的一切，對我是特別熟悉的。特別使我觸目醒心的就是ＸＸ公學，ＸＸ中小學，ＸＸ小學：：：等等，有的在校名上面還堂堂皇皇的注着什麽「市敎育局立案」，「市敎育局准核」。呵！這顯然是一種很「景」的氣象，在ＸＸ一條路上就有這麽多的學校，呵！學校的林立，怪可觀的觀象！</p>
<p>爲着自已也是在這種學校裏混日子的一員，所以對於這些不期然地就巽樣關切的注意起來，學校太多了，我們的學校是要受影響的呀！少了我的一個學生，無　巽就是少了我幾元錢學費的收入呀！厄運！</p>
<p>一天，覺得無聊得很，就和某同事去参觀鄰近的許多學校，那裏是一間或二間大不過丈餘的客堂，置放着幾隻僅成模形的課桌，一塊方方的小黑板外，什麽都沒有了。這樣的簡陋就是一個所謂「學校」，那無怪「學校」的林立了，我祇得感嘆出門。</p>
<p>這完全是私塾的遺形或脫胎，根本的相異點，除了死坐着打盹的，換了有上課下課休息的。死背「趙錢孫李。：．：．」的，一變而爲「你的」「我的」「狗兒」「貓兒」，其他還有什麽有益的改善呢！是的，敎科書是太簡陋了。因此，識三個半字的阿貓阿狗都能敎：社會中失業的高速度地澎脹了，於是爲着生計的窘迫，不得不以這「學校」作暫時的避難所。</p>
<p>最可笑的，就是我看見某的校章上有這樣的一句話：「如有同胞姊妹兄弟同來，學費可打九五折」哈！萬分的感謝。辦敎者的熱忱，不遺餘力的提倡敎育的盛意，顧慮窮苦同胞的切心。還有某校在招生的廣告上竟「道地」繪了校舍全圖｜｜因爲是所謂洋房｜｜呵！辦敎者的苦衷，他們想以校舍來誘引一般愛虚榮的小學生，來引起他們求學的與趣，這眞正是所謂「無微不至」了。</p>
<p>總之，ＸＸ路上的學校是林立着，「這現象是景？是怪？是進步抑沒落？」我這樣的想着！</p>

<p>編輯先生：，</p>
<p>前次寄來一封信，多承你在，貴欄裏答覆我，眞使我感謝得紙筆難宣了：現在我又有一個出於我意外的難題，來勞煩，先行，想終能諒解我一切困難吧！前次缺少銀錢的事情，還沒有解决，繼而又發生一椿失竊郵票十餘張五分的事情：雖是很小的事，可是嫌疑的注集，較前更覺嚴重了。我想十餘張郵票，一時終用不了的：所以在當天夜裏，暗底下細心地找尋。後來在某一同事的抽屜裏（係他放書籍一類另物者）發現了。次日當衆訴明一切經過。他呢因爲要否認自已所爲，不得不將計就計，反謂他人的陷害他。衆人亦都異口同聲地問，發現郵票時，可有第二者目見？呀！這是暗底裏所尋着的綫索，當然是沒第二者。先生這不是搬石自壓脚面嗎？眞呌我有口難分了不然這一些小小的事情，不知查有付諸於法庭的可能嗎？　　先生，可否答覆我一個較妥的辦法嗎？</p>
<p>我晶願犧牲其他，而不願損失該項名譽者，現在等待你的佳音吧！敬頌撰安顧月義上</p>
<p>編者按：前次顧君因爲店裏失竊銀錢，受了不明不白的嫌疑，寫信來尙對策。我們的答復是呌你暗中留意：做慣沒本錢賣買的人（賊），决不從此束手：祇須捉住了地次二次，虚實就可以大白，現在固然不出我們所料，第二次的偷竊，又發現了。你這次的所以會弄成自害自的原因，完全在你的手續尙未精密、搬石頭的會得弄到壓痛自已的脚，完全因爲兩手無力，或搬之不得其法：要是你柙完力足，那裏會自害自呢？假使你在查到之後，不要立即當衆報告，而用冷眼再去看他，等到他使用這郵花之後，再行捉穿！他那裏還可嫁過於人呢？</p>
<p>所以這次我們的答復，還是照以前地樣，好在他們對於你，還祇不過是一種嫌疑，並不有更嚴重的形勢，呌你不得不求速决也。以後如果遇到機會，手續上應當格外留意，免得被人反噬。涉訟是不必的，而且不必的。</p>

<p>老婦：是呀！碰着這樣的事又有什麽　　辦法呢？可憐我的第二個孩子敵　　人捉去挑子彈，到現在二十多天　　了，還不見回來。誰知道還沒有　　人在呢？我的二媳婦一天到晚在　　家裏恨天恨地的哭，可憐眼睛都　　哭腫了，可是又有什麽用呢？中年丙：不過想來想去，旣然是爲了　　國家的事，也就沒有方法怨誰，　　祇要能夠打退敵人，奪回東三省　　，即使做敎化子，也比做亡國　　强得多，幾匹牲口又算有什麽呢？</p>
<p>中年：可是話又說回來了，我們不是　　已經完糧納稅了嗎？自古道；「　　養兵千日，用在一朝」，現在總　　算和日本条了一次仗，又要我們　　老百姓提槍帶馬，不是太话話了　　嗎？</p>
<p>中年乙：那當然囉，内戰的時候已經　　弄得我們家敗人亡，現在是和外　　國人交鋒了，少不了是更要我們　　的命了。</p>
<p>老婦：說來眞是奇怪，這樣的年頭連　　菩薩也不靈了。正月裏我在這廟　　裏求了一張籤，說是要等三月間　　黃牛山出了眞命天子，天下方得</p>
<p>太平。可是現在這末久了，天子　　都該老早出世了，還是不得太平　　，誰曉得這是怎麽一回事呢？中年乙：菩薩的事總是靠不大住的。老年：那不能這樣說的，山東濟南府不是已經有眞命天子造了神牛鑾　　駕了嗎？不過是時辰日子未到，　　總還得要我們多受一點罪罷了。　　大槪是玉皇大帝正要我們多多受　　罪，看看下界衆生是不是回心轉　　意。譬如說去年北京的水陸道塲　　，本來很可以超度衆生的，可是　　又不敎人民凈屠齋戒，所以不單　　是不能感動天神，反而怒惱了玉　　皇大帝，敎殺神下凡，殺一個十　　萬八千。誰知道本莊繁不就是殺　　神轉世呢？總之，中國的氣數已　　盡，天意如此，到底是沒有辦法　　的哩。</p>
<p>孩子：那未宣統皇这不是已經登基了　　嗎？爲什麽還要東打西打呢？中年丙：你這個小孩子，懂得什麽？　　就是爲的是登基了，所以才要打　　天下呀。</p>
<p>中年甲：那不能這樣說的。這次打過　　萬里長城來，根本就不是宣統那　　小子自已要打，壓根兒是日本人　　出主意的，宣統不過是個傀儡罷　　了。</p>
<p>老婦；聽說這個宣統皇帝還很年輕哩。</p>
<p>老者：可不是。屬馬的，和我那小的　　一個同年，今年才二十八歲哩。　　所以命裏派定了要做皇帝始終是　　要做皇帝的。但是這種皇帝到底　　靠不住呢？</p>

<p>The Yellow River water in Xuzhou follows the old course, turns north from the Dasha River, and heads towards Zhaoyang Lake and Weishan Lake via Fengpei. Because of the obstruction of the two dams east of Gaozhai, very little water flows eastward into Xuzhou. Currently, the heads of Xiao and Dang counties are supervising a large number of laborers to prevent and block the two dams in Gaozhai, so the Yellow River water has not gone down to the east. However, Fengpei is in danger. With the Yellow River changing its course, people in Xuzhou are slightly relieved. However, according to experienced people, the flood season has not yet passed, and the old course of the Yellow River in Xuhuai and downstream is still not out of the danger period. If the upstream water of the Yellow River does not continue to rise, the floods in western Shandong and northern Jiangsu can be expected to be alleviated. Otherwise, the future is not optimistic. The breaches in the old dikes around Xuzhou have been repaired day and night, and the project can be completed on the 20th. (Central News Agency Dispatch on the 18th)</p>

Although the Yellow River water is approaching Xuzhou, fortunately, the water flow is northward and has not crossed the Longhai Railway subgrade, so railway traffic is normal. The Xuzhou Works Section of the railway has prepared to build a long dam between Haozhai and Jiulishan to prevent the water from destroying the road section.

<p>After Song Zheyuan took over the Chahar Provincial Government in Beiping, the Chahar Provincial Government plans to implement a reorganization. The candidates for the heads of the various departments have been generally agreed upon. Song intends to invite Pang to join. Yesterday, Wang telegraphed Song, urging him to telegraph the list of Chahar Provincial Government committee members and department heads to Nanjing, so that it could be submitted to the Executive Yuan meeting for announcement. Song telegraphed the Executive Yuan last night, and the list is as follows: Committee member and Chairman Song Zheyuan, Committee member and Head of the Department of Civil Affairs Qin Dechun, Committee member and Head of the Department of Finance Guo Zhihan, Committee member and Head of the Department of Construction Zhang Weifan, Committee member and Head of the Department of Education Lu Fu, Committee member Demchugdongrub Prince, Committee member Pang Bingdong. (Special Dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>At 4:00 pm today in Beiping, Song Zheyuan, accompanied by Qin Dechun, paid a visit to He. Jiang Bocheng and Xiong Bin were also present. They had in-depth discussions on the aftermath of Chahar. Song will return to Zhang to disperse the miscellaneous troops in Chahar after the aftermath issues are resolved. Song has telegraphed them separately, ordering them to stay in their original defenses and await the reorganization orders from the Military Sub-Committee. The Chahar authorities will still take a lenient approach to Ji Fang et al., hoping that Ji Fang et al. will leave Junsu and be given a title by the central government. The detailed methods for the reorganization of the miscellaneous troops are being discussed by He and Song. During this trip to Chahar, Song advanced 25,000 yuan for the disbandment expenses of Feng's headquarters, more than 3,000 yuan for the living expenses of Zhang Renjie's division, and the statistics of grain and military uniforms owed by Feng in Zhangjiakou totaled about more than 100,000 yuan. How to raise this fund in the future is also being discussed. As for the military expenses of 150,000 yuan, the difference between the current number of troops is too large. Song proposed to study it today. The number of miscellaneous troops and the amount of military pay are even more difficult problems. The authorities are afraid that after the end of the military affairs, there will be no way to save the financial situation in North China. If more troops are added, the burden will be heavier, so they have to consider it carefully. In terms of finance, they decided to take a reduction method. After tonight's meeting, they will consult with the central government and Jiang separately. After receiving a reply, Song will return to Chahar and implement it step by step according to the established detailed methods.</p>
<p>Song Zheyuan originally scheduled to visit He Yingqin this morning in Beiping to discuss the aftermath of the Chahar situation. Because He's toothache had not healed, he was going to the hospital for treatment, so he telegraphed and asked Song to meet him in the afternoon. Because all the problems have not been resolved, Song needs to stay in Ping for a few more days to discuss with He in detail. The funds required for the incorporation of the Chahar miscellaneous troops are quite large, and he hopes that the central government can find a way to subsidize them. After the negotiations are completed, Song will go to Zhangjiakou and start working. (Special Dispatch on the 18th)</p>

<p>Speaks to Ministry Staff</p>
<p>The National Government of Nanjing announced on the 17th that Foreign Minister Luo is on an inspection tour of Xinjiang, and the position of Foreign Minister is held concurrently by President Wang. At 3:00 pm on the 18th, Wang went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to take office. Luo introduced the ministry staff to meet each other. Wang said in his speech that since Foreign Minister Luo is on an inspection tour of Xinjiang, the position of Foreign Minister is held concurrently by me. Since 1938, all comrades have followed Minister Luo, working hard and enduring hardship, which is commendable. Under the guidance of Minister Luo, the laws and policies of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs are fair and incorruptible, which is admired by people in the government. Regarding foreign policy, after the National Defense Conference has discussed and decided, the ministry will faithfully implement it. The affairs of the ministry will be handled according to the methods during Luo's tenure. Luo's inspection tour will take three or four months, and the responsibility is very heavy. The Xinjiang issue is extremely complicated, and it is urgent to plan ahead. After Huang Musong returned to Nanjing, the central government deeply felt the need to send another senior official to inspect. I and Chairman Jiang once asked Dai Jitao to go, but Dai could not travel long distances due to his poor health. Fortunately, Luo did not refuse to endure hardship and agreed to go. This trip is related to foreign affairs, and is related to the entire Chinese nation. Its significance is very important. I hope that all comrades will continue to do so with the spirit of following Minister Luo and working together to overcome the national crisis. (Central News Agency Dispatch on the 17th)</p>

<p>Arrives in Shanghai That Evening</p>
<p>Huang Fu arrived in Nanjing at 11:00 am on the 18th on the Jiang'an ship from Xun. Chu Minyi, Gao Lingbai, Xu Jingzhi, Deng Hongye, and other more than ten people went to meet him. The ship stopped in the center of the river. At 11:30, he was welcomed ashore by a small boat and went to Chu's residence in the Ministry of Railways with Chu Minyi to rest. Wang scheduled a banquet for Huang at 6:00 pm on the 18th, with Luo Wengan accompanying him. Huang told reporters from the Central News Agency in a small boat: 1. The four steps originally scheduled to resolve the Chahar incident. First, ask Mr. Feng to resign. Second, ask Song Zheyuan to return to Chahar to preside over the situation. Third, Feng leaves Zhangjiakou. Fourth, Feng's troops are settled. Now the third step has been realized, but Feng has recruited many miscellaneous troops and the reorganization will take time. Living and defense issues must be properly arranged. As for giving Feng a title, it was also discussed in Lushan, and it will not be difficult after the first four items are implemented. It will not help to just give him a title. 2. Relief in the war zone is extremely complicated because the war zone is fifty times larger than Shanghai, and the war period is five times longer than Shanghai. The central government has prepared 1 million yuan in cash and 4 million yuan in public bonds in the midst of financial difficulties to engage in relief, which is indeed painstaking. In the future, we should gradually implement the measures to cure the root and symptoms that were previously determined. 3. Regarding the opening of traffic between the Beining Railway and the pseudo-Fengshan Railway, we hoped at that time that it would be possible to travel from Beining to the pseudo-territory, and not allow pseudo-vehicles to enter the pass, but this matter is still in progress. 4. I plan to stay in Nanjing for one or two days and then go to Shanghai. (Central News Agency Dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>Huang Fu will go to Shanghai tonight. He said earlier that he had verbally tendered his resignation due to his poor health, but Jiang and Wang earnestly retained him. He plans to be responsible for a certain period of time, and will resign when the government has someone to replace him to take a rest. This trip to Shanghai is to raise funds for relief in the war zone, but it is still difficult to say how much can be raised. He plans to rest in Shanghai for a few days and return to Nanjing and then to Beiping at the end of the month. (Special Dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>Huang Fu came to Nanjing from Jiangxi at noon on the 18th. Shao Yuanchong and his wife came with him. Reporters from various newspapers asked Huang about various points. He replied as follows: 1. The government has discovered 1 million yuan and issued 4 million yuan in Northeast Relief Bonds for the war zone in North China for relief. However, the war zone is 50 times larger than the Battle of Shanghai, and the war period is also five times longer, so it is inevitable that it is just a drop in the bucket. However, the finances are dilapidated, and we can only handle it from an economic point of view. 2. The Chahar incident has come to an end after Feng left Zhang, but the reorganization of the army is extremely complicated and it is extremely difficult. 3. The issue of Feng's future title has been discussed by Jiang and Wang by telegram and is expected to be resolved. The reason why it has not been announced yet is because it is felt that the organization and reorganization of Feng's army are difficult. 4. I will stay in Nanjing for a day or two and then go to Shanghai. After Huang got off the boat, he went to Wang's residence to visit and had a long conversation. Wang held a banquet that night to welcome Huang, and invited the heads of various departments and committees to attend. (Special Dispatch on the 18th)</p>

<h3 id="e16">Zhao Pilian Arrives in Nanjing Yesterday <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Talks About the Current Situation in Shanxi Province</p>
<p>Zhao Pilian, the representative of the Taiyuan Pacification Director Yan Xishan stationed in Nanjing, said that he arrived in Nanjing on the morning of the 18th. Last month, he was summoned to Shanxi to visit Yan and report on the central government's major plan to deal with the current situation. Yan expressed sympathy for Feng's anti-Japanese views, but also used the name of friendship to persuade Feng to respect the central government's overall plan and await the orders of the central government. Yan quite agreed with the central government's consistent peace in the Chahar incident. Now that Feng has handed over military and political power and resolutely left Chahar for Shandong, the Chahar incident is no longer a problem. Huang Shaoxiong and Xu Yongchang did not meet when they left Taiyuan. At the Fifth Plenary Session in November, Yan will attend in Nanjing if he can spare time, depending on the situation in North China. The current situation in Shanxi: 1. The finances are still in a difficult situation. The monthly income and expenditure offset each other, and the shortfall is about 600,000 yuan. Shanxi has created this economic panic due to the issuance of banknotes for more than 20 years. At present, in addition to the provincial government's banknotes, which are still in circulation, private coins in various places have been banned. 2. After Yan's two rounds of troop cuts, the total number of troops in Shanxi is also within 100,000, which is still considered a huge military expenditure, and it is still planned to find ways to reduce it. 3. After the strict prohibition of opium poisoning in Shanxi Province, it seems that there is hope of eradication. He expected that last year the Japanese smuggled white flour (i.e., opium substitutes) to Shanxi for sale, which is even more poisonous than opium. Therefore, in order to resist white flour, the ban on opium was slightly relaxed, so that addicts would reject white flour. Therefore, this white flour has recently disappeared, and opium will also be banned from planting and transportation. He also said that Jiang Shouting, a scientist in Taiyuan, invented a self-made charcoal car, and went to Yu on the 13th for a long-distance test run. Yan sent personnel to accompany the car. The results were good, and he ordered the Northwest Industrial Company to prepare for a car manufacturing plant, which plans to make all the structures by itself and improve them to use charcoal instead of oil.

After meeting Wang this morning and discussing the results, it was decided that the consolation of the various ethnic groups in Xinjiang, the investigation of the border situation, and the improvement of transportation and justice all urgently need to be carried out. It has been decided to change the itinerary and fly directly to Dihua next Tuesday or Wednesday. It has also been decided that the Ministry of Communications will allocate a plane for use. The reference materials needed are currently being collected separately. It is expected that two staff members and one doctor will depart on the same plane. Other personnel will depart successively. (Special Dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>Luo Wengan in Nanjing originally planned to take the land route from Henan, Shaanxi, and Gansu to Xinjiang, and inspect the judiciary along the way. However, because the central government urgently hoped that Luo would enter Xinjiang as soon as possible, he changed his route to Xinjiang again and will fly directly to Hami on Thursday or Friday of next week on a special plane prepared by the Ministry of Communications. He will then take the land route to inspect the judiciary when he returns. Only Lin Donghai and Feng Youzhen will travel with him, and the remaining staff will continue to travel. According to Luo's interview with the Central News Agency reporter on the 18th, I was ordered by the central government to go to Xinjiang to inspect the diplomatic and political situation, so that the central government can understand the situation in the frontier, consolidate the relationship between the border and the central government, and Xinjiang is adjacent to foreign countries, and diplomatic relations are also very complicated. I am willing to contribute to the central government whatever I have gained from the inspection. Everything must be fully understood after arriving in Xinjiang. At this time, there are not many opinions. The task of inspecting the judiciary in Henan, Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces is also very important. Because the itinerary has been changed, I will still need to go to inspect when I return to Nanjing. (Central News Agency Dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>Wang, President of the Executive Yuan, telegraphed the military and political authorities in Nanjing Xinjiang to announce the central government's intentions. It is heard that the new military and political authorities expressed their sincere welcome.

It is heard that Gong Bicheng and Ma Bufang's representatives visited Luo one after another on the 18th and offered something. (Central News Agency Dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<h3 id="e18">Lin Jing Transferred for Disciplinary Action <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing Supervisory Committee member Zhou Lisheng impeached Lin Jing, the Director of the Civil Affairs Department of Gansu Province, for selling official positions and titles, embezzling public funds. The said committee sent a letter to the Gansu Higher Court for investigation and reply. Now, according to the reply, there is no evidence to be obtained regarding the sale of official positions and titles. However, it is true that public funds were deposited in the name of his young daughter, Miao Yin, at Fufengyong Bank. Moreover, the manager of the bank, Liu Junguang, confessed that when Fufengyong went bankrupt, Lin changed the name on the deposit slip from Lin Miaoyin to Lin Liefo, and added the words "Civil Affairs Department Funds" on the account. Later, Director Xu told me to change Lin Miaoyin to Lin Jing, but I dared not change it again, so I was sent to Lanzhou County and imprisoned, and so on. This clearly shows that the director of the department initially intended to turn public funds into private funds. Later, when the deposit closed due to the bank's bankruptcy, he again referred to the private funds as public funds. It seems that he has gone to great lengths to seek personal gain, harming the public interest. Therefore, according to the law, an impeachment was filed and a request was made for disciplinary action. The case was assigned to Supervisory Committee members Wang Pingzheng, Du Bao, and Hu Boyue for review, and no objections were raised. It has now been transferred by the committee for disciplinary action, and a request has been submitted to the National Government for approval and implementation. (18th Dispatch)</p>

<p>The Government's Dispatch of Personnel to Investigate Anti-Japanese Donations Cannot be Delayed</p>
<p>Since Generals Li Du's "Worldwide Telegram" and "Cold Generation Telegram" were published, the issue of the income and expenditure of anti-Japanese donations has exposed a new trend. Mr. Zhu Qinglan, during this new trend, has temporarily become the center of suspicion. Although the truth can be proved by facts, social faith is inevitably affected. With regard to the exposure of this new trend, on the one hand, we are worried about the future of anti-Japanese donations, and on the other hand, we have turned to the investigation of the income and expenditure of donations, which is easier to start with. Because the news that was spread three weeks ago was that only a small number of the huge amount of donations were actually delivered to the anti-Japanese generals. Where are the undelivered funds? Many aspects are related to the matter. It is difficult to conduct a thorough investigation. Social doubts are difficult to break. Therefore, we proposed at the time that all agencies that handled the collection and remittance of donations should quickly initiate an automatic general inspection. This proposal did not disregard other difficulties, but sought to clarify the truth and stabilize people's hearts as soon as possible. Therefore, it is necessary to seek simplicity and ease of implementation. Now, the mark in the news at that time has gradually become clear. Li's reply to Zhu's "Generations Telegram" has the sentence "I have heard many doubts from you in the past year." Suppose this doubt is the root of the problem, then examine clearly what Zhu himself, who has been suspected, has handled. If the receipts and expenditures are clear and there are no malpractices, social trust can be restored as soon as possible, leaving some room for fundraising when the country and society have something to do in the future. If the investigation reveals any doubts, the responsibility lies with one person, and the bad atmosphere permeating the society can also be swept away. The government has accepted the request of social groups and those who handled the donations, and has urgently selected honest and upright officials who are trusted by the people to be responsible for the investigation in order to clarify right and wrong.</p>
<p>Moreover, the expenditure of anti-Japanese donations is a kind of emergency funds during the opposition between the two countries. In addition to those with obvious malpractices, there are some parts that should be kept secret temporarily. This is a matter of necessity. Today, the question of the use of anti-Japanese donations, the social and related aspects, the atmosphere is becoming increasingly tense. Public opinion is boiling, and questions are rising. The person who handled the donations, in order to keep himself clean, may unintentionally leak the secrets to the outside world. This is unavoidable. Although this does not have a very significant relationship today, it is still suspected that the timing has not arrived, and it is easy to cause other disputes. Zhu Qinglan's reply to Li Du's telegram and Cha Liangzhao's talk to reporters have revealed the end of being unable to hold on. Following this, it will be even worse. Today, the government must not only prevent the leakage of secrets, but also prevent someone from using secrets to cover up their malpractices. It is imperative to send personnel to investigate.</p>
<h3 id="e23">Pacific Society's Japanese Policy Becomes Target of Criticism <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>Chinese Representative Says Boycott is Only a Passive Weapon China Has a Surplus Population of 4.5 Million Annually, Needs Emigration Outlets, and Regards Japan as Particularly Urgent British Representative Criticizes Japan for Encouraging Unfair Business Competition</p>
<p>When the Pengfu Pacific Society held a meeting, Japanese policies were attacked twice, one was Japanese commercial competition, and the other was the Manchuria issue. Regarding the first issue, the British representative criticized Japanese industry, saying that it encourages unfair competition in order to seize the world market. The British representative said that Japanese wages are low, which puts the industries of other countries in an unequal position, and the government also provides rewards to producers. It also took advantage of the depreciation of the Japanese yen to manipulate the financial market in order to make profits, and so on. When discussing the Manchuria issue, the debate was particularly fierce. What was most interesting was that each Japanese representative who attended the meeting only spoke within the scope of his own responsibilities, saying that "Manchukuo" would never become a Japanese colony, and that Japan's population surplus should be eliminated by gradually developing Japanese industry, and that Manchuria should be regarded as a raw material reserve for Japanese industry, and so on. The Chinese representative stood up to reply, saying that the population surplus in Japan is only 1 million per year, while in China it is 4.5 million. Therefore, it is China, not Japan, that should seek a way out, and so on. (17th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>When the Pengfu Pacific Society discussed the issue of the Chinese boycott of Japanese goods today, the Chinese delegation said that China's military strength is too weak, so tariffs are the most powerful weapon for them. A spokesman for the Japanese delegation declared that the development of Japan's foreign trade is the only way out for the country's population increase. If the current living standard and wages in Japan are not increased, all countries in the world will import cheap Japanese goods. A famous Japanese economist, Takahashi, said that, from the standpoint of the capitalist system, we believe that the only way to solve the problem of low wages is to solve the problem of Japan's surplus population. When discussing the time, the Chinese delegation expressed the opinion that if the countries of the Western Hemisphere regard pills, newspapers, movies, and chewing gum as the highest culture, then the East is willing to abide by the legacy passed down from generation to generation. (17th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Pengfu, the Japanese representative Takahashi at the Pacific Society, declared, "Because Japanese products are cheap due to low manual labor, Western countries have raised tariffs to resist them. However, the more serious the situation, the cheaper Japanese wages are. The only way to solve this is to establish a compromise based on fair competition," and so on. (17th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Pengfu, Gregory, a professor of banking at the University of London in the United Kingdom, said in a speech at the Pacific Society today that the US industrial recovery plan may fail unless the US president re-expands the currency. Its plan itself requires an expansion of the currency to assist it, and he has not seen any other way to succeed. Therefore, the US dollar should consider both stability and expansion. He also said that what he said was only to predict the trend of the economic recovery plan, and it was not a suggestion to expand the currency. Moreover, he usually advocated stabilizing the currency, believing that after the currency is unstable, both buyers and sellers do not know what to do. Other countries have to raise tariffs to protect themselves. Currency instability can also lead to the dumping of goods. All its effects are detrimental to international trade. (17th National Dispatch)</p>
<p>Pengfu, the Japanese representative to the Pacific Society, Nitobe, told reporters today that although Soviet Russia currently intends to be peaceful, there is no doubt that Moscow is preparing for war at this time. For example, the recent construction of military supplies and ammunition factories in Eastern Siberia, and the laying of double tracks in Siberia, are all clear evidence of this. Under this environment, Japan has no choice but to prepare for war at all times. He also said that the Sino-Japanese military conflict has now effectively ended, and Japan has completely achieved its goals. As for the claim that Japan plans to colonize Manchuria and North China, it is not true, because the weather in both places is not suitable for Japanese people. The previous encouragement of immigration to Manchuria failed for this reason. Therefore, the Japanese would rather regard Manchuria as an investment place and a market for manufactured goods.

<p>Will Protest to France</p>
<p>Does Not Recognize Pre-emptive Declaration</p>
<p>Tokyo: Since France declared its occupation of nine islands in the South China Sea, the Japanese military believes that these islands have significant military implications for Japan.</p>
<p>The Navy is urging the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to oppose it, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is hesitating, which has led to a struggle between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Navy. The Navy even issued a statement blaming the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for its incompetence. It is said that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs could not bear the Navy's blame and has prepared to protest to France, and insists that Japan has pre-emptive rights. This statement is planned to be submitted to France in the middle of next week. (18th China United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The Japanese Foreign Ministry and Navy authorities have decided not to recognize the French government's previous declaration of pre-emptive occupation of six islands in the South China Sea for the following reasons. It will formally respond to the French government next week. (1) The islands declared by the French government's pre-emptive declaration are exactly the same as the islands operated by Japan's Lhasa Phosphate Mining Company for mining operations. The fact that Japan exercises private rights has been recognized, so it is claimed that the private rights of the Japanese people exist on these islands. (2) The French government's declaration is only a declaration. If this is the completion of the procedure, it is not seen as feasible from the perspective of international law. Therefore, Japan will not recognize the French government's pre-emptive occupation this time. (3) However, the Japanese government has nothing to do with these six islands. It does not intend to dispatch the navy to take active action to occupy the nearby islands. (18th Dentsu Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After the French Foreign Ministry declared the occupation of nine islands in the South China Sea, it consulted with the Army and Navy authorities to discuss countermeasures. At the same time, it collected materials from the civilian side and studied how to deal with this issue under international law. Recently, because a final decision has been made, it plans to instruct the ambassador to France, acting as Sawada, to submit a document to the French Foreign Ministry within a week protesting against France's occupation of the nine islands. The content is not based on the reason that the Japanese people lived on the nine islands first, but cites precedents in international law and explains and applies them from the perspective of international law, expressing Japan's attitude.

<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese are very concerned about the Philippine issue. Today, the Dongbao reported a telegram from Manila saying that the Philippine Island Council has decided to decide the Philippine independence issue by popular vote. It is said that women are also allowed to vote. It also said that the Philippine government has decided to use 1.25 million Philippine pesos to manage aviation, dividing a total of ten aviation teams with 132 aviation personnel. There are twelve main airfields, with a distance of about 32 miles between each airfield. Landing fields will be set up on various small islands. The plan is to be completed in three years, and the financial resources will be obtained by issuing public bonds. (18th China United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Manila) Independence Party members of the Philippine Island Senate and House of Representatives held their third party meeting. After three days of heated debate, they decided today to submit the US Congress's Philippine Island Independence Act to a national referendum for public decision. According to the views of most leaders, women should also have the right to vote at that time. Therefore, before holding a national referendum, women's right to participate in politics must be granted first. The date of the national referendum has not yet been decided. It is expected that this proposal will be passed soon after it is submitted to the Philippine Island Legislative Council. Afterwards, according to the party leader, the national referendum will determine the will of the Philippine people, whether they are willing to accept the case unconditionally, or will accept it conditionally. As for whether the national referendum should also express opinions on the immediate and unconditional independence, it will not be proposed according to the current plan. This result can be regarded as a victory for the faction of Senate President Ko Shun. However, since a national referendum is held, there must be a major political movement beforehand. Former House Speaker Roxas and former Senate President Osumina will also work hard to promote the proposition of unconditionally accepting the independence case. The Ko Shun faction advocates conditionally accepting the case and applying to the US Congress to revise this case to delete some clauses opposed by the Filipinos. (18th National Dispatch)</p>

<p>Unofficial Japanese Government Statement</p>
<p>Criticizes Britain for Excluding Goods</p>
<p>(Washington) The US government plans to levy a dumping tax of 50% on Japanese rubber shoes, light bulbs, etc., and is currently considering its implementation. (16th Japan United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) India has raised the tariffs on Japanese cotton cloth, and the British colonies have also continued to implement high tariffs to resist the import of Japanese goods into the country. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs is planning to send representatives to Shimla to discuss this issue. On the 18th, it issued an informal statement saying that Britain occupies a quarter of the world's territory and is almost independent in terms of the raw materials for its products. When the raw materials are exported to various countries, the industrial producing countries use British raw materials to manufacture goods and export them to Britain, and Britain's action of preventing these goods from entering the country is not justified. The British and colonial authorities believe that the Japanese government allocates industrial subsidies to producers, and misunderstand that cheap Japanese goods are dumping. However, the Japanese government has absolutely no such thing as issuing subsidies. The reason for the prosperous export of Japanese goods lies in the depreciation of the Japanese currency, and the reason why Japanese cotton cloth is cheaper than foreign goods is due to the technological development of so-called industrial rationalization. The technology of the British Manchester cotton yarn industry has not progressed, and industrial rationalization has not been implemented. It is still using old-fashioned machinery for production. Britain does not carry out rationalization, but uses its international position to suppress the goods manufactured with British raw materials in Japan. This is the most unreasonable act in international economics. (18th Japan United Press Dispatch)</p>

<p>National Berlin Dispatch, 18th: The tenth German Radio Exhibition was opened this morning by Propaganda Minister Goebbels. The exhibits are mostly novel, including a new type of radio called the "People's Radio", which was made by the most famous German radio technicians. It can be called high-quality and low-priced. What is even more surprising is the opening of a sound and color electric theater. A factory in Germany has created a machine that can send and receive images and sounds. This new product can receive important scenes from all over the world, and then transmit them by radio to sound and color cinemas thousands of miles away. The short-wave receiver and television can shoot the radio waves transmitted from the outside onto a specially made original film. This film can be self-washed and dried. After a few seconds, this film can be shown to the public and can emit sound. This machine was invented by Dr. Banny Viz of the German Ministry. In the future, the public will be able to listen to artistic songs and see the appearance of the artists on stage at the same time. Not only will they be able to listen to the speeches of politicians, but they will also be able to see their demeanor and the surrounding situation at the same time.</p>

The disaster situation is extremely serious, unprecedented in decades. Shandong Provincial Chairman Han Fuju, in addition to sending telegrams to the disaster-stricken county magistrates to cooperate with the people to desperately defend and rescue, has also been sending telegrams to Chairman Chiang, Chairman Lin, President Wang, Minister Huang, and the Relief Committee for days, requesting that they quickly prepare for blocking the breaches and quickly release urgent relief to save lives.

<p>㈠ Urgent, must arrive immediately, addressed to Chairman Lin of the Nanjing National Government, President Wang of the Executive Yuan, Minister Huang of the Ministry of Interior, and Chairman Chiang of Guling: According to successive telegrams from the Heze County Government, the south bank of the Yellow River in Erfenzhuang, Dongming County, Hebei Province, breached at Zhenri, the water level is more than one zhang high, heading straight for western Shandong; also, the south bank of the Yellow River in Yuanzhai, Kaocheng County, Henan Province, breached at Zhen evening, flooding Kaocheng and the Shandong counties of Shan, Jun, and Cao; also, the north bank above Shitou Village, Section 1 of the Hebei River Affairs Bureau, has a breach several li wide, flooding Changyuan, Hua County, Puyang, and the Shandong counties of Pu, Fan, and Shouyang. The south bank of the Yellow River in Hebei and Henan provinces has always had many dangerous projects. Once a breach occurs, not only will dozens of counties in western Shandong be flooded, but there will be a risk of severing the Tianjin-Pukou and Longhai railways, diverting the Grand Canal, and entering the Huai River. In addition to ordering the disaster-stricken counties to desperately defend and rescue, I am hereby reporting this for your information, and requesting that you instruct the preparation of blocking the breaches and the release of urgent relief to save lives. Please also issue instructions for me to follow. Han Fuju respectfully bows. ㈡ (Title omitted) The situation of the Yellow River flooding and inundating Shandong Province has been reported in detail. Recently, Sun Zerang, the magistrate of Heze County, reported in an urgent telegram that there was heavy rain all night, and all the newly built embankments overflowed. The water has now reached the city wall, with a depth of three or four chi on flat ground. The northwest of the city has become a flooded land, and fields have been submerged. The Taoyuanji area in the southwest is also being flooded from Kaocheng, and the disaster situation is severe. Many people have drowned and have no food or clothing. Please allocate funds for urgent relief. Gu Liangyou, the commander of the Caozhou militia, also sent a telegram with the same information, and ordered officers and soldiers of the militia to do their best to protect. In addition, Wei Hanzhang, the magistrate of Cao County, telegraphed that villages within ten li to the west, south, and north of the county seat are mostly surrounded by water, with a local depth of three to five chi. He has ordered all districts to take measures to block the breaches and repair the city wall day and night. In addition, Liu Jing, the magistrate of Dingtao County, telegraphed that the heavy rain at night caused the water to rise continuously, and the embankments collapsed as soon as they were blocked. All the villages in the south of the county have been flooded. In addition, Wang Xizhen, the magistrate of Shan County, telegraphed that the breach in the Yellow River in Henan Province has reached the Laojun Ditch, the border between Cao and Shan counties, with a depth of about one zhang and five chi. He has ordered his subordinates to assess the situation and take measures to defend. In addition to telegraphed orders to desperately defend and rescue the victims, and reporting separately, I am hereby reporting this. Your official, Han Fuju, respectfully bows. ㈢ (Title omitted) I have reported in detail on the situation of the breaches in the Yellow River in Henan and Hebei provinces and their inundation of Shandong Province in telegrams. In addition, I have reported that the Heze County Government and the Caozhou Eight Counties River Works Promotion Association successively reported in their telegrams that there was heavy rain all day, pouring down all night, causing the water level in the rivers northwest of the city to rise sharply, and the newly built embankments collapsed successively, and the fields were almost completely flooded. The four Qian Rivers in the west were all filled with water from the Yellow River, overflowing the embankments, flowing to the northwest, and merging with Weizhuang in the east, penetrating the entire northern territory and heading east towards Juye. The current is very strong and is still rising. The water situation in Cao County is even more vast. The continuous flood and overflow has turned all the counties in western Shandong into a muddy country and continues to increase, what a dangerous situation. In addition to ordering the disaster-stricken counties to desperately defend and rescue, and dispatching special personnel to supervise the work, I am hereby reporting this and requesting approval, ordering the preparation of blocking the breaches and the rapid implementation of relief to save lives. Please also issue instructions for me to follow. Your official, Han Fuju, respectfully bows.</p>

<h3 id="e70">Telegram to the Relief Committee <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>(1) Urgent Arrival Required, Nanjing.</p>
<p>Respected Relief Committee,</p>
<p>Regarding the situations in Henan and Hebei provinces where the Yellow River breached its banks, flooding areas in Shandong province, a telegram has already been sent to you. Now, according to subsequent telegrams from the Heze County government and the Cao Prefecture Eight-County River Works Promotion Association, torrential rain has been falling like pouring water on cold days, ceaselessly throughout the night. The river currents to the northwest of the city have swelled violently, and newly built dikes have successively collapsed, inundating almost all the fields and crops. The four western dry riverbeds are all filled with Yellow River water, overflowing the embankments and flowing to Weizhuang in the northwest, converging eastward, traversing the entire northern territory, and heading towards Juye. The source of the water flow is currently very strong and is still increasing. Furthermore, the situation in Cao County is particularly severe. Given the continuous flooding in recent days, the counties in western Shandong have all become a watery realm, and the situation continues to worsen, posing a significant danger. In addition to telegraphing the central government to urgently plan for repairs, we are specifically telegraphing your esteemed committee to quickly organize and provide emergency relief to save lives. We await your prompt instructions on how to proceed.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Han Fuju, Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government.</p>
<p>(2) Urgent Arrival Required, Nanjing.</p>
<p>Respected Relief Committee,</p>
<p>According to recent telegrams from the Heze County government, the south bank of the Yellow River in Erfen Village, Dongming County, Hebei Province, breached its banks on [a certain date], with a water surge of more than ten feet high, heading directly towards western Shandong. Also, the south bank of the Yellow River in Yuanzhai, Kaocheng County, Henan Province, breached its banks on [a certain date] evening, directly inundating Kaocheng and Shan County and Cao County in Shandong Province. Furthermore, the north bank above Shitou Village, Section 1 of the Hebei Provincial River Affairs Bureau, has an opening several miles wide, flooding Changyuan, Hua County, Puyang in Henan Province, and Pu County, Fan County, and Shouyang County in Shandong Province. The south bank of the Yellow River in Hebei and Henan provinces has always had many dangerous structures. Once these collapse, not only will dozens of counties in western Shandong be submerged, but there is also the risk of severing the Jinpu and Longhai railways and diverting transportation into the Huai River. In addition to telegraphing the central government to urgently plan for repairs, we are specifically telegraphing your esteemed committee to quickly organize and provide emergency relief to save lives. We also await your reply on how to proceed.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Han Fuju, Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Telegram to the Chairmen of Hebei and Henan Provinces <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>To Chairman Yu Xiao of Tianjin, Brother Hou,</p>
<p>To Chairman Liu Jingfu of Kaifeng, Respected Brother,</p>
<p>I have received a telegram from the Cao Prefecture Eight-County River Works Promotion Association, stating that due to heavy rain on a cold night, the river currents on all rivers to the northwest of Heze city have swelled violently, and newly built embankments have collapsed one after another, inundating fields and crops, and now approaching the city's outer walls. The situation in Cao County is particularly severe. They urgently request that the Hebei Provincial Government instruct the River Affairs Bureau to quickly block the breach on the south bank to save lives. The Yellow River has breached its banks in Hebei and Henan provinces, invading Shandong territory. The floodwaters are spreading rapidly, and the counties in western Shandong have become a watery realm. I eagerly await your prompt plans and active measures on how to block the breach on the south bank, in order to save lives. I await your urgent instructions.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Han Fuju.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Yellow River Water Reaches Jiangsu Province <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Zhouzhai in Dangshan County Already Submerged</p>
<p>Water Speed is Seventy Li Per Day</p>
<p>Transportation Bureau Ordered by Provincial Government to Defend</p>
<p>Yangzhou Correspondence: The Jiangbei Canal Engineering Bureau has received a telegram from the Provincial Government stating that Fengxian County reports that the Yellow River water has already reached Dazhai in Dangshan. In addition to the two thousand workers supervised by the bureau to reinforce and block the breaches in the old Yellow River embankment at Zhouzhai and Gaozhai in Dangshan Prefecture, a telegram should also be sent to Pei County to fully cooperate in blocking Gaozhai, while Dangshan County should fully defend Zhouzhai. Another telegram from the county on [a certain date] states that the Yellow River water has reached Zhouzhai, with a waterhead one li wide and five chi deep, and a rear flow five li wide and more than one zhang deep. The water speed is approximately seventy li per day. The bureau is currently supervising workers to block the Gaozhai dike opening and requests that Pei County expedite its arrival. Considering that the Yellow River water has reached Zhouzhai in Dangshan County, it may flow north into Zhaoyang and then into Weishan Lake, or southeast along the old course of the Yellow River. It is estimated that it will enter the canal within two or three days. The central canal should first establish defenses, assigning specific responsibilities. Meanwhile, efforts should continue day and night to gather laborers for defense and to intensify inspections, without the slightest negligence or delay. This matter should be strictly observed and reported. In times of urgent defense needs, the county magistrates of each county should listen to the commands of the Transportation Bureau to unify authority and avoid disputes. Furthermore, the Transportation Bureau has already telegraphed the Huaipiao Department of the Engineering Office to establish defenses and conduct patrols starting immediately, and to dispatch staff to Hanzhuang and Weishan Lake to patrol and report the water situation regularly. It is also heard that the Transportation Bureau plans to gather laborers immediately to block key points such as Lanjia Dam and Weishan Lake to strengthen defenses (August 17).</p>
<h3 id="e73">Restoration of Pinghan Railway Transportation <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Express Trains Running, Regular Trains Terminate on Both Banks</p>
<p>Yellow River Bridge Tilting, Repair Project Enormous</p>
<p>Railway Bureau Losses Approximately 500,000 Yuan in One Week</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The Pinghan Railway was affected by the Yellow River's rise, causing the railway bridge to tilt and the tracks to be damaged. Trains could not pass directly. From the 9th to the 15th, north-south transportation was cut off for a week. The Railway Bureau's business losses, estimated at 60,000 yuan per day, totaled 420,000 yuan, plus other losses, for a total of approximately 500,000 yuan. Now that the water level is gradually receding, the special express train conducted a trial crossing of the bridge on the 16th, and full line operation was restored on the 17th. However, the bridge construction is a major undertaking, and it will be difficult to repair it in a short time. To avoid increasing the danger, all regular trains will temporarily terminate on both banks. The Railway Bureau's news is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e74">Inspection of Bridge Conditions <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>The Pinghan Railway Management Committee, previously received a report from the Zhengzhou Station Master that the Yellow River had risen and flooded the railway bridge. It specifically dispatched the Chief of the Engineering Department, Wang Jinzhi, to rush to the site for inspection. Mr. Wang telegraphed the Committee on the 15th, stating, "The situation of the Yellow River bridge was quite serious in the previous few days. After rescue efforts day and night by this office, it has slightly eased by the 15th. All southbound locomotives can reach Bridge No. 50, and northbound locomotives can reach Bridge No. 90. However, the section from Bridge No. 50 to Bridge No. 90 is definitely impassable for locomotives. To facilitate transportation, it is decided that from the 16th onwards, the first and second trains will use the lightest 20-ton or 15-ton Pingdong vehicle for northbound and southbound transfer. However, the section from Bridge No. 50 to Bridge No. 90 must be pushed by manpower. The transfer time is limited to 17:30 to 20:00 (5 PM to 8 PM) daily. Please do not delay, so as not to hinder the bridge work," and so on.</p>
<h3 id="e75">Temporary Ferrying Measures <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>The Committee also received a telegram from the Second Section Chief of Zhengzhou, agreeing on temporary ferrying measures, which stated, in brief, that regarding the issue of train traffic on the Yellow River Bridge, a settlement has been reached with the construction party. It is decided that starting on the 16th, the first and second express trains will be transferred first. The method is that the construction party is concerned that the original trains are too heavy to cross the bridge and may cause danger. It is agreed that six third-class cars, converted from 20-ton covered cars, will be prepared on the north and south banks to transfer passengers, postal and baggage cars. They will still be pushed across the bridge tracks by manpower. The transfer time is set from 11 AM to 2 PM to avoid hindering the work. Zhengzhou Station is instructed to prepare forty laborers, divided between the north and south banks, to be responsible for transferring luggage and pushing cars. To maintain order, the police have been consulted and capable police officers have been dispatched. The train department has also dispatched the Deputy Section Chief of Zhengzhou and the Deputy Section Chief of Xinxiang to supervise the car service inspectors and station staff to jointly assist in directing and maintaining order. To adapt to the transfer time, the departure times of the first and second trains should be changed to avoid hindering the construction party's work.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Advance Departure Times <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>The Committee, after receiving</p>
<p>the telegram, immediately</p>
<p>instructed the Car Service Department to formulate the following measures for advancing the departure times of the express trains: (1) The first train will depart from Qianmen, Beiping at 15:30 (3:30 PM), arrive at the north bank of the Yellow River at 11:30 AM the next day, depart the south bank of the Yellow River at 14:35, and arrive at Dazhimen, Hankou at 9:30 AM on the third day. (2) The second train will depart from Dazhimen, Hankou at 16:00 (4:00 PM), arrive at the south bank of the Yellow River at 10:57 AM the next day, depart the north bank of the Yellow River at 15:40, and arrive in Beiping at 10:58 AM on the third day. As for the regular express trains in both directions, they will all go to both banks of the Yellow River. All passengers and luggage will be pushed across the bridge in the above-mentioned covered cars. When the special express trains cross the bridge, because they must be pushed by manpower, the journey will take 42 hours, three hours slower than usual.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Department Consultation on Repairs <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>The Pinghan Railway Management Committee is paying close attention to this obstruction of the Yellow River. In addition to sending the Chief of the Engineering Department, Wang Jinzhi, to the site for inspection, the Chairman of the Committee, He Jingwu, and the Committee Member, Xiao Qizhan, have also departed successively to supervise the repair work. The tracks at Zhan Dian on the north bank were repaired earlier, and special trains could barely pass. However, six or seventy holes in the middle of the bridge are half-filled with mud and half-tilted by about two inches due to water damage. The repair project is huge, and the cost is considerable. How to carry out the construction requires careful planning. Now, the Ministry of Railways has dispatched Wu Qiyou, a designing engineer from the Jinpu Railway, to Zhengzhou via the Longhai Railway to consult with the Chairman of the Committee, He Jingwu, the Committee Member, Xiao Qizhan, and the Chief of the Engineering Department, Wang Jinzhi, on repair methods. The plan will be submitted to the Ministry for approval soon and implemented. The Yellow River Railway Bridge has long exceeded its insurance period, and with the riverbed rising daily, there is a constant risk of being washed away. If it is not thoroughly repaired, the vast natural barrier will forever be a fearsome route for travelers (17th).</p>
<h3 id="e78">Feng Yuxiang Goes to Tai'an <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Two-Day Tour of Scenic Spots in Jinan</p>
<p>After Climbing Mount Tai, He Stays at the Five Worthies Temple</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: After Feng Yuxiang arrived in Jinan on the 15th, he, accompanied by Han Fuju, Chairman of the Provincial Government, toured Thousand Buddha Mountain and visited the swimming pool at 6 AM on the 16th. At 5 PM, he hosted a banquet at the Provincial Government's East Building, inviting key figures from the province and old friends from the Northwest. This morning (17th) at 5 AM, Feng and Han, each accompanied by seven or eight guards, took two cars and traveled west along Ximen Street to visit Daming Lake. The cars stopped in front of the Tiegong Temple, and Feng and Han got out and stood on the city wall road, gazing into the distance for a long time. Then they went down the city wall steps, entered the Tiegong Temple, and toured the area. They then changed to small boats and went to visit the lake. They went up to the North Pole Pavilion, climbed up the steps, and looked far into the distance, taking in the entire scenery of the lake. They also made brief stops at the Lixia Pavilion and Zhang Gong Temple. They returned to the North Pole Temple and invited Zheng Jicheng by phone to go to the city north to hang [offerings] at the grave of Zheng Jinsheng. At around 7 AM, Feng, Han, and Zheng Jicheng took cars out of the North Gate. The Provincial Public Security Bureau dispatched a cavalry guard company to protect the cars. They rested at the Caiyuanzhuang station and had breakfast, including large bowls of noodles and steamed buns, without any side dishes. During the meal, a garlic seller passed by, and Feng bought garlic for two cents to eat with his meal. After the meal, Han paid ten yuan, causing the restaurant owner to be overwhelmed with gratitude. Han asked, "Have you ever seen Commander-in-Chief Feng?" The owner replied, "We have heard of Feng Yuxiang, but we have never seen him." Han smiled and pointed, saying, "This is Commander-in-Chief Feng." The crowd was surprised and delighted, stepping forward to pay their respects. Feng and Han laughed, got up, and got into the cars. At that time, a Yang woman, hearing that Han was traveling here, specifically stopped the car to accuse the village chief of forcibly digging up her sweet potatoes. Han instructed the district to mediate. They soon arrived at Zheng's graveyard west of Beixinzhuang. Feng took a wreath and presented it in front of the tomb, bowing three times. Han also did the same. When Zheng's relatives heard that Feng and Han had arrived, more than twenty people came to wait. During the ceremony, Zheng Jinsheng's young son (very young) was also at the tomb, kneeling and bowing to thank Zheng Jicheng. Feng couldn't help but tear up. Zheng's relatives invited Feng and Han to rest inside the village and offered tea, but Feng refused. However, he gave a simple speech to Zheng's relatives, saying in essence that the deceased, Zheng Jinsheng, was his close friend, generous and righteous, and had done much revolutionary work. He had shared hardships with him many times. The Zheng family had such a hero, which was truly an honor for the family. Unfortunately, he was killed by others. His friend's descendants were also willing to give their lives to avenge their father's grievances, allowing his old friend to rest in peace. He also felt greatly honored, and so on. Zheng's relatives then offered bean soup for Feng to quench his thirst. Feng took it, personally placed it in front of Zheng's tomb, bowed again with tears, and then said goodbye to the crowd and got into the cars to return to the city. They rested at the Provincial Government's East Building. Zheng Jicheng also came to thank Feng and Han for the grand funeral ceremony. Feng instructed Zheng that Sun [Ke], the President of the Legislative Yuan, would come to Jinan from Qingdao tomorrow, as well as Minister Chen [Gongbo] and other members of the Central Committee. When you were in trouble, they appealed on your behalf. You should thank them, and so on. Zheng agreed. Feng then took a car to the Progress Association for lunch. Having toured in Jinan for two days and with the residence in Tai'an prepared, he decided to leave Jinan for Tai'an in the afternoon. Han followed Feng's wishes, telling all agencies not to go to the station to see him off. At about 3 PM, Feng, accompanied by Han, arrived at the station. At the time, Adjutant General Han Wenxiu, Brigade Commander Wu Huawen of the Rifle Brigade, Jinan Mayor Wen Chenglie, Public Security Bureau Chief Wang Kairu, and others all came to the station to see him off. Li Xin, Zhang Jiyong, and others also followed Feng. At 3:10 PM, they left Jinan heading south. The engine-hauled cars traveled very fast, arriving in Tai'an at 4:45 PM. Tai'an County Magistrate Zhou Baihuang and representatives from various agencies, as well as Feng's guards who had arrived in Tai'an earlier, all welcomed him at the station. Feng got out of the car, made brief greetings, and then got on a mountain sedan chair to ascend the mountain. Many farmers welcomed him along the way. An old peasant woman in a hut at the foot of the mountain greeted him, asking, "How is the Commander-in-Chief?" Feng said, "I am well, are you well?" All the attendants were also recognized by the old peasant women, who greeted them one by one. Halfway up the mountain, the abbot of Bingzhao Temple, Qing Shan, led young monks to welcome him. They met and greeted each other. Feng said very well and</p>

<p>Qingjiang, a City Twice Captured by the Red Bandits</p>
<p>Qingjiang Correspondence: Since the Red Bandits attempted to cross the Gan River westward and invade Jishui and Xingan, the Gan-Yue line has been blocked for nearly a month. The 14th Army has been ordered to restore traffic on the Gan River, stationing troops along the river. Ships can gradually travel up and down, but when passing through certain dangerous sections between Xingan and Xiajiang, they are still often at risk of being shot at by bandit troops. Sometimes only the ship's cabin is damaged, and sometimes passengers are killed. The reporter waited quietly for three days but did not see a single ship safely sailing from the upper river. Therefore, he abandoned the inspection of the Gan-Yue line and instead embarked on a trip to western Jiangxi, sailing up the Yuan River. After traveling about ten li upstream, he saw three or four wooden planks floating on the water, with faint traces of writing. He picked one up and saw the words "Strive for all Soviet areas, fight as one." The boatman caught sight of it, snatched it, and threw it into the river, saying, "Lao Yuan (meaning a common address for a fellow townsman from another province, like 'brother' or 'sir'), did you pick up this plank in the river? Two or three months ago, my brother was traveling from Xinyu to Zhangshu by boat when the water was high. There were many such wooden planks floating down. He picked up several pieces to use as firewood, but the water police gave him trouble." He was also asked if the harvest was good. Then they went to rest in the temple. Zhang Jiyong, Li Qi, and others stayed at the foot of the mountain, while Feng himself stayed at the Five Worthies Temple. According to news here, Sun Ke, the President of the Legislative Yuan, will arrive in Tai'an tomorrow to meet with Feng. Also, while Feng was traveling, someone led a child to kneel and welcome him by the roadside. It is said that they were father and son, extremely poor and pitiful. Last year, when Feng was in Tai'an, he gave them money for clothes and found them a bowl of rice to eat, so they came to kneel and welcome him (17th).</p>

<h3 id="e80">Levy of National Defense Donation <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Taxing Merchants at 2% of Capital</p>
<p>Collected by Public Security Bureaus Starting from the 15th</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The Guangzhou community recently organized a Public Air Defense Committee, formulated measures, and raised funds to purchase aircraft to consolidate air defenses. The method of raising funds is to hold a national defense donation, soliciting donations from all stores in the city. The donation standard is to levy 2% of the store's business license and business tax amount. Chen Jitang instructed the Provincial Public Security Bureau to be responsible for handling the matter. After receiving the order, the Public Security Bureau specifically sent a letter to the City Chamber of Commerce yesterday to request a copy of the city's store business licenses and business tax amounts in its possession to levy the tax according to the amount, and decided to start collecting it today (15th). The collection measures are as follows: (1) The donation will be paid at 2% of the amount on the business license. (2) If a store has not obtained a business license due to small business operations, it should be exempt from paying this national defense donation. (3) The business license amount should be the standard for collecting donations. (4) Long strips with the words "National Defense Donation Received for Business License Amount" will be created and issued. Stores that have paid the donation will affix the printed strips to the front of their doors for verification. (5) Donation tickets will be in quadruplicate. One copy will be given to the store for receipt, two copies will be submitted to the Public Security Bureau for storage and transfer, and one copy will be stored in the Public Security Bureau for future reference, with the bureau's seal affixed as a guarantee. (6) The national defense donation will be checked and collected by staff assigned by each Public Security Bureau to go to each store, and there must be no errors. (7) The director of each Public Security Bureau will be fully responsible for this donation. (8) The collection of donations will be handled concurrently by the police donation collectors of each Public Security Bureau. (9) The donation collection will begin on August 15th and must be completed within one month (August 15th).</p>
<h3 id="e81">Special Correspondent of this Newspaper: Ren An <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Discovered, and Charged with Communicating with Bandits</p>
<p>"Later, although he was guaranteed by the Shipping Guild and narrowly escaped death, the disaster of imprisonment has not yet been lifted." Upon hearing this, the reporter thanked him for his kindness and asked why his sailcloth was so tattered that it only had a slight effect on harnessing the wind. He sighed and said, "We don't have enough to eat, how can we have extra money for anything else? In these times, soldiers and taxes are frequent. Many boatmen have abandoned their boats and are hiding deep in their homes. Those who cannot leave and are working are forced to do so by hunger." As they were talking, suddenly the yellow dust obscured the sun in the left front, and the waves gradually increased. The boatman quickly reeled in the cable and turned the rudder, just barely making it to the right bank when a violent wind roared in, followed by heavy rain and huge waves, causing the boat to capsize and tilt greatly. Those sitting upright in the cabin could not even lie flat. This lasted for about two hours before the wind died down and the river became calm. Several boats carrying garlic were broken by the wind and waves, and garlic floated in the river, which the fishermen eagerly collected. Upon arriving in Qingjiang, the soldiers guarding the city were just closing the city gates, as the sun had already set in the west.</p>
<p>The entire territory of Qingjiang covers approximately 3,800 square li, with a population of approximately 230,000. The main product is rice, with more than enough for local consumption, and about 200,000 shi are sold to other places annually. Special products include about 30,000 shi of melon seeds, priced at about 15 yuan per shi, and about 10,000 shi of tangerines, priced at about 5 yuan per shi (other details are in the Zhangshuzhen correspondence). However, since the bandits became rampant, many villages have been taken over by bandits. In 1919, the bandits captured the city twice, looting, killing, and setting fires, causing great damage. The biggest loss was the destruction of the Datong Public Pawnshop. The pawnshop (i.e., public pawnshop) had a long history and considerable capital. Every year, it used its profits to carry out a wide range of charitable activities. The manager, Mr. Zhou, was a wealthy gentleman who had been transporting cash to his home in advance. When the bandits arrived, he fled to Nanchang. Because there was no cash in the pawnshop, no one tried to find a way to take charge and negotiate, so the bandits unconditionally returned all pawned items worth less than three yuan to their original owners, and collected principal and interest on items worth more than three yuan. Valuables were confiscated. Later, Mr. Zhou returned to his hometown and vehemently denied having public funds at his home, which aroused public anger. He then conspired with the county magistrate to lure and kill him with wine. In addition, merchants' inventories, such as oil, salt, and rice, were forcibly sold by the bandits for only two cents per yuan. Fortunately, most of the office workers and wealthy residents had fled, and only three people were killed. However, there were many cases of kidnapping for ransom.</p>
<p>The kidnapping and ransom business is currently flourishing. The county government recently seized a sample of a bandit kidnapping and intimidation letter, which is copied as follows: "Mr. So-and-so, Greetings. Our army is struggling to overthrow imperialism, overthrow the rule of a certain party, eliminate feudal forces, carry out land revolution, and seek national independence for China and the liberation of the working, peasant, and laboring masses of the whole country. In order to complete the above great task, we urgently need huge military and political funds. We have long admired your abundant savings and generosity. Therefore, we are sending you a letter in advance, asking you to donate a certain amount of military pay in silver and pay it in full within a few days. We will issue a receipt (protection), and then protect your life and property. We trust that this small amount will not be refused in any way.

<h3 id="e82">Store Owner Missing, Declared Liquidation <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Yue Temple Street is a prosperous commercial area. However, this year, due to the low price of rice, all industries have been depressed. All major stores have shown poor business, but Tongfengtai Foreign Goods Store, due to the store owner Shen Changshou's good management, has had very developed business. Unexpectedly, on the 20th of this month, the store owner took money to Shanghai to pay bills. Before leaving, he told his family that he would go to his relative Chen Youquan's house in Rinanqiao via Shanghai and stay for about two or three days. The next day, wholesalers in Shanghai sent someone to Songjiang to collect the money. The store was already very surprised. Then the Chen family in Rinanqiao also waited for Shen to arrive and sent someone to Songjiang to urge him. Then the family became alarmed and realized that Shen Changshou was missing. They hired people to go to Shanghai to search and inquire, but found no news. It has been more than a week now, and the store has stopped business. His wife, Shen Shi, hired lawyer Zhang Zhijie to declare liquidation. According to rumors, Shen Changshou looked honest, so he absorbed a large amount of deposits from various households. The suspension of business and liquidation must be due to financial turnover problems, so he came up with this strategy. One saying is that Shen owes more than 10,000 gold, but he has only been married to Ms. Shi for four months, so the family is crying day and night, and the situation is tragic.</p>

<p>This year's autumn silkworms are twice as many as in the past. A week ago, due to the drought and lack of rain, the mulberry leaves were withered and yellow. Most farmers were deeply worried. Currently, there are occasional thunderstorms, and silkworm and farmland have benefited greatly. Currently, the autumn silkworms in Yeqiao, Shitangwan, Bashiqiao, Hujiadu, Dongting, Zhouxin Town, Daqiangmen, Chang'anqiao, Zhangjingqiao, Dangkou, and other areas are mostly in the second and third sleep stages. Zhangcun, Nanqiao, Rongxiang, Yangjingyuan, Hudai, Jiangxiqiao, Anzhen, Outangqiao, Qianzhou, Yuqi, Lishe, Beiqi'fang, Fuzhou Village, and other places are in the early sleep stages. The silkworms are in good condition. The market price of mulberry leaves is between 3.50 yuan and 2.00 yuan per load. If the weather does not change drastically, the future harvest will be good. This is also good news for the future of silk.</p>

<p>Zhu Qi, the newly appointed Director of the License Tax Collection Office in this county, plans to double the license tax for the tobacco industry in this county, which has aroused repercussions in the industry. He sent a letter to the County Chamber of Commerce to forward to the Collection Office to strive to maintain the original amount. After receiving the letter, the office still insisted on its opinion, stating that the license tax for tobacco and alcohol is related to both the Ministry and Provincial treasury and is listed as a legitimate income. Last year's selection committee may have had some inconsistencies in the tax rates for the merchants, which should be corrected according to regulations. It immediately replied to the County Chamber of Commerce, forwarding the letter to the industry to persuade them to comply with regulations, pay taxes, obtain licenses, and not provide any excuse for obstruction, and so on. After receiving the letter, the industry still expressed dissatisfaction. Yesterday, it specifically issued an emergency notice to all members of the industry, ordering them to convene a general meeting of members at the association on the afternoon of the 19th to discuss solutions.</p>

<p>Hua Village, Sanshan Township, Fourth District of this county, has been repeatedly subjected to</p>
<p>kidnappings by bandits and shootings of villagers. It is now</p>
<p>learned that the Capital Garrison Headquarters previously captured a bandit named "Monkey," who confessed to the Hua Village case, stating that the kidnapped wife of Hua Baogen (i.e., Eighth Sister) was hidden in the home of Kong Xianming in Potang Village, Third District. Two hostages, both surnamed Tang, one thirty-six years old and the other only twelve years old, were also hidden in Potang Village. The bandit leaders were Feng Pengzhang, Feng Dayuan, and Feng Xiaoyuan, a father and two sons. Another guest resident, Yang Lianzhong, was an accomplice of the Fengs and also a notorious bandit. After receiving the confession, the Garrison Headquarters dispatched over forty armed constables in vehicles to the town, disguised to make the arrests. Unexpectedly, the bandits guarding the hostages opened fire with their Mauser pistols to resist arrest. As a result, one bandit escaped, one was captured, and three hostages were rescued. Yang Lianzhong was also captured. All have now been escorted to the capital for interrogation. After questioning, the hostages will be released. The Feng family, who are still at large, are currently being pursued and will be brought to justice once captured.</p>

<p>On the evening of the twelfth of this month, a sudden storm arose. In Huaiyin,</p>
<p>nineteen out of every ten houses in Yuanji, Zhaoji, Zhuji, and other places in the northern countryside were overturned by the wind. That evening, Honghu Lake in the second district of this county was affected by the storm. The resulting tragedy was even more severe than on land. It is reported that several hundred merchant ships were docked in the harbor of Gaoliangjian. When the wind rose, the masts of the ships snapped, the sails were destroyed, and the ships capsized in the waves, creating an extremely dangerous situation. As a result, twenty-seven ships of various sizes were lost, and many boatmen were drowned. Moreover, nine households near the lake in the water patrol team's quarters were submerged. The most severely affected was the family of Ye Derong, where one woman and three young children died. It was truly a catastrophe.</p>

<p>Xianggou, the second daughter of Yao Hongxuan, the owner of Zhang Hongchou Silk Shop in Hangzhou’s Shiban Alley</p>
<p>and Mad Dog Lane, was only nine years old,</p>
<p>lively and cheerful. Her parents cherished her like a pearl in their palm. On the afternoon of the seventeenth, her mother went out, and the girl carried a washbasin to a nearby pond to play in the water. Carelessly, she lost her footing and fell into the water. At that time, it was raining heavily, and there were few passersby. Although the girl shouted loudly for help, no one came to her rescue, and she drowned. After 2 p.m., a worker from a weaving factory, Mr. Jia, passed by the pond and saw the girl floating on the surface of the water. He rushed to inform her family, who pulled her out and requested a doctor from the hospital to come and treat her. However, it was too late, and she could not be saved. Her mother was grief-stricken by her daughter's tragic death and was overcome with sorrow.</p>

<p>He Jinhua, a resident of No. 85 Ban’er Lane in Hangzhou, was from Dongyang. He married Wu Cui, a woman from the same hometown.

Cui Zhen checked the pawn ticket but had lost it. She reported the loss to the pawnshop, but it had already been redeemed. After the woman returned home, she was overwhelmed with regret and indignation and conceived the idea of suicide. Yesterday, at 4:00 p.m., she secretly hanged herself in the room. When her husband returned home and discovered her, she was already dead.</p>

<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, having heard of Norway’s exclusion of overseas Chinese, yesterday specially cabled the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to inquire about the truth. The text of the cable reads: "To the esteemed Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing: Reports indicate that there are only six overseas Chinese in Norway, half of whom have already been expelled. It is now heard that the remaining three in the country will also continue to be ostracized. Since this news was published, Hansson, the Norwegian Consul General in Shanghai, has issued a denial, published in the local newspapers on August 6th, stating, 'There are only three overseas Chinese in the entire country of Norway, and it is logically impossible for there to be any anti-Chinese actions.' Is it true that there are only six overseas Chinese in Norway? Were the three previously expelled deported on false pretenses, or are there other reasons? The Consul's statement seems to completely dismiss the previous expulsion of the three. Recently, cases such as Mexico’s expulsion of over ten thousand overseas Chinese have occurred, and the Consul of that country in Shanghai has also denied the facts. Such one-sided defenses are inherently untrustworthy. Merely because Mexican business in China lacks deep and reliable foundations, there is no way to deal with it. Norway sells the most paper to our country, which is different from the situation in Mexico. It seems that we cannot listen to their excuses and fabrications. What is the truth? We earnestly request your esteemed Ministry to investigate and inform us. Respectfully, Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce."</p>

<p>The National Products Factories Association</p>
<h3 id="e103">Submits a Request to the Ministries to Maintain Domestic Steel <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Implement a Tax on Dumping</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Products Factories Association submitted a joint request to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry yesterday, stating: "We are submitting this request to maintain domestic steel and increase the dumping tax on foreign steel. The association convened a meeting of the Executive Committee on August 15th of this year. Standing Committee Member Zhang Zigeng proposed a motion to maintain domestic steel, stating: 'Our country is rich in mineral resources, especially iron. The earliest and largest-scale iron smelting plant in our country was the Hanyang Iron Works in Hubei. Unfortunately, due to various reasons, it has long been shut down. The only domestic producer left is the reorganized Liuhegou of the Yangtze Plant, with a monthly output of only over 2,800 tons. Now, due to the dumping of foreign steel at prices as low as over fifty taels per ton, it has fallen to twenty-five yuan, which, including other expenses, only amounts to twenty-eight yuan. However, the cost of domestic steel requires sixty-six yuan, a difference of twenty-eight yuan. As a result, the iron ore is in a precarious state and may collapse at any moment. If this continues, it will inevitably close down. The country is based on the people, and the people are based on industry, which in turn is based on iron. The survival of a mine is small, but the interests of the country are greatly affected. If the country has no iron, the foundation of all its industries will be in the hands of others. How can it hope to revitalize itself? Therefore, our colleagues have organized the China Machinery Joint Company and are doing their best to advise the industry to adopt domestic steel. Although the patriotism of various industries may be able to arouse their righteous indignation for a time and encourage them to purchase it enthusiastically, it is not enough to plan for the long term. The only thorough solution is to ask the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Finance to consider the pain suffered by domestic steel and its impact on the future of industry, and to increase the dumping tax on Japanese iron in accordance with international practice, so as to protect this only remaining domestic steel and benefit the progress of future industries infinitely.' The resolution was passed, transferred, and recorded in the files. It is reasonable to submit this request. We earnestly request your esteemed Ministry to approve our request and consider the pain that foreign steel dumping is obstructing the sales of domestic steel and affecting domestic iron ore, and that it is in danger of being unable to sustain itself. We request that you approve the implementation of a dumping tax in accordance with the Foreign Goods Dumping Tax Law to maintain the sales of domestic iron ore, which would be a public convenience."</p>

<p>Wu Yicheng, the acting commander-in-chief of the National Salvation Army of China under Wang Delin, sent Wang Haishan as a representative on August 1st, carrying a letter from Wu, secretly entering the Pass to report on military affairs to Commander-in-Chief Wang Delin, and to beg for assistance from all walks of life. Wang Haishan has arrived in Shanghai yesterday and plans to go south to meet Wang Delin. The original letter from Wu Yicheng to Wang Delin is recorded as follows: "Commander-in-Chief, I am sending Wang Haishan to secretly enter the Pass to report on the recent battles and destruction at the front, and to appeal for material assistance in order to resist for a long time. I ordered all brigades on July 1st to launch a general offensive on July 15th, combining all brigades to work together in their respective locations, to do their best to destroy and disrupt. I then assigned the work addresses of each brigade (in secret). After July 20th, I received successive reports from Brigade Commander Qi Shuangsheng, etc. On that day, Brigade Commander Qi destroyed railways and cut down telegraph poles for more than forty li in a certain place, intercepted several trains, killed forty-eight Japanese soldiers, and obtained some supplies and military equipment, achieving considerable victory. On the same day, Li Qingtian reported that on that day, in a certain two places, over 2,000 comrades gathered and burned many houses in both places, causing heavy losses to the Japanese. Koreans rioted in sympathy, but unfortunately, they did not occupy the area. The commander of the guerrillas reported that at dawn on the 15th, they led a team to attack a certain city, climbing the trenches three times before repelling the Japanese soldiers, killing over thirty Japanese soldiers and capturing a lot of military supplies. Our army suffered dozens of casualties and then occupied the area. Zhang Yuting reported that after leading a team to destroy the west bridge of a certain six stations, a Japanese military vehicle derailed and fell under the bridge, crushing over a hundred Japanese soldiers.</p>

<p>The Interim Regulations for the Collection of Land Value Tax in this city have been revised several times and were officially promulgated at the end of July this year. Therefore, although the collection regulations stipulate that the land value tax will be collected twice this year, in July and January, since July has already passed, it has been postponed to be collected from January to August. Therefore, the land value tax to be collected for the first half of this year will be reduced by one-sixth.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Deadline for Filing <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>According to the regulations of the land value tax, the landowners should first report the land value and then submit it to the valuation committee to determine the land value. Currently, the bureau is drawing up forms to distribute to landowners and set a deadline for filing so that the land value can be determined as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Foreign Leased Land <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Among the urban areas in this city that have been determined to collect land value tax, there is still a part of the land that is perpetually leased by foreigners. According to the collection regulations, the perpetually leased land should pay land value tax in accordance with the regulations. However, since this matter involves Sino-foreign negotiations, the municipal government should notify the consuls of the countries to which the perpetual leaseholders belong and instruct the perpetual leaseholders to report the land value and pay taxes in accordance with the regulations. Therefore, the bureau is currently rushing to investigate the situation of all foreign perpetual leases in the inner city, preparing a list, and submitting it to the municipal government to request each consul to notify the perpetual leaseholders.</p>
<h3 id="e110">No Collection from Farmland <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>As for the part of the farmland in the urban area, it has been decided not to collect land value tax, but to continue to collect land tax. All the farmland tax collection offices originally established in areas such as Hunan District will be closed when the land value tax is collected, and a land value tax collection office will be established separately.</p>
<p>The name and firearms have all been obtained. The telegraph poles and railways at the Seventh and Eighth Stations have all been destroyed. On the same day, Guo, Brigade Commander of a certain area, led a team to destroy many railways and burn bridges. Yao, Brigade Commander and Mrs. Kong, have caused extensive damage to the railways and telegraph poles east of a certain area. The above is a general description of the situation of the various brigades since the battle on the 15th. Details will be reported later. However, our army's ammunition was originally not abundant and lacked a source. Although we obtained a small amount of ammunition from the enemy after this general offensive, it was not enough to replenish half of our needs. Please find a way to provide assistance to resist. Winter clothing should be prepared as early as possible to avoid the suffering of being frozen and hungry for the 100,000 strong. We also ask the Commander-in-Chief to return to defend the country as soon as possible to boost morale, or please ask Deputy Commander Kong to return to defend the country first and lead the effort.</p>

<p>Lights Shone Brightly the Night Before Last</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai Times, the brilliantly lit Russian Consulate General building last night (the 17th) shows that it is fully occupied by new staff.  Perhaps last night was the first time. It is unknown. Nearby residents have been accustomed to the building being empty for a long time, and were taken by surprise by the brightly lit condition, and no doubt had a strange feeling, it is said.</p>

<p>The new commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, Mr. Hepburn, arrived in Shanghai from Japan on the 15th and took office yesterday morning on the flagship Houston. The ceremony was very simple, starting at 9:15 am and ending at 9:25 am. There was no inspection or grand exercise. The former commander, Mr. Taylor, handed over the command amidst music. The new commander's flag was then raised on the mast of the flagship Houston. After attending the inauguration ceremony, he will return to the U.S. submarine fleet stationed in Qingdao next Monday, so that next month, he can join the mine-sweeping destroyer fleet anchored in Yantai and set sail for Shanghai at the same time.</p>

<h3 id="e116">Two Urgent Telegrams from the Chinese Taxpayers' Association <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the French Occupation of the Nine Small Islands</p>
<p>The French Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association sent two telegrams yesterday to the National Government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the French Minister to China, strongly arguing for our country's territorial sovereignty. The two telegrams are transcribed below:</p>
<h3 id="e117">Telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>To the esteemed Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government in the capital, it is reported that French warships have occupied nine islands belonging to our country's Qiong province, which is a gradual initiation of armed aggression. Public sentiment is extremely indignant. If negotiations are not carried out quickly to recover them, it will inevitably arouse the covetousness of other countries. How can the integrity of our country's territory be guaranteed? If the other party continues to rely on its strength and occupies them for a long time, we should urgently appeal to the League of Nations in order to preserve our territory and maintain sovereignty. We earnestly hope and pray for this. Sincerely, Shanghai French Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association, Xiaoxiao.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Telegram to the French Minister <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>To His Excellency Mr. Wilden, French Minister to China in Beiping, it is reported that warships from your country have occupied nine small islands south of our country's Hainan Island. Our citizens are extremely indignant about this. We sincerely hope that Your Excellency will consider the friendship between China and France, and quickly convey to your government that they respect the integrity of the territories of all member states of the League of Nations, and promptly remove all forms of occupation, in order to maintain the friendship and strengthen the amity. We earnestly hope and pray for this. Sincerely, Shanghai French Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association, Xiaoxiao.</p>

<p>According to the Central News Agency, Mr. Sergiomong, the Chilean Chargé d'Affaires to Japan, has been ordered to concurrently serve as Chargé d'Affaires to China, and is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the Japanese ship Nagasaki Maru on the 20th to take office. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs specially instructed the Shanghai Office to inform them yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Tang Youren Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Made a Statement</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Mr. Tang Youren, Secretary-General of the Central Political Council, returned to Nanjing from Lushan with President Wang (Jingwei). He took the night train to Shanghai the night before last, arriving here at about 8 a.m. yesterday morning. A Central News Agency reporter met with Mr. Tang at his residence in the Yu Garden and made the following remarks:</p>
<p>Luoxun's Mission to Xinjiang According to Tang, Xinjiang is located on the frontier and is very important. Moreover, the region is divided amongst many ethnic groups and religious beliefs, creating an unusually complex situation. The great powers are eyeing the region, engaging in various schemes. By taking advantage of the differences amongst ethnicities and religions, they are attempting to instigate manipulation in order to fulfill their ambitions of aggression. The central government has seen the hidden worries of Xinjiang, compounded by the inconvenience of transportation and the isolation of news. Therefore, Minister Luo (Wen'gan) has been specially dispatched to inspect the situation in the Northwest and prepare for development, and to prevent major problems in the future. During Minister Luo's inspection period, President Wang (Jingwei) will temporarily serve concurrently as Minister of Foreign Affairs. As soon as Minister Luo returns to Nanjing, he will hand over the post. Rumors that Minister Luo will be appointed full-time Minister of Judicial Administration and that President Wang will serve as Foreign Minister for a long time are not true. The rumor that I will be transferred to the post of Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs is also incorrect. As for when Minister Luo will set out, it is difficult to determine at present.</p>
<p>Feng Yuxiang May Enter Nanjing The Xicha Case has now been resolved peacefully, but all the follow-up matters are quite difficult to handle, especially the reorganization and reorganization of the troops. Feng Yuxiang has now arrived in Jinan and may enter Nanjing. As for what title the central government will give Feng, it has not yet been determined, but it is definitely not a military position. The North China war zone has been completely taken over, but there are rampant bandits and administrative difficulties, and the future is not optimistic.</p>
<p>Use of American Cotton and Wheat The use of American cotton and wheat was decided at the Lushan Conference to be entirely for construction expenses. As for the issue of distribution, it will be decided after Minister Song (Ziwen) returns to the country. Rumors that part of the American cotton will be sold to Japanese merchants seem possible from a commercial point of view, but they are definitely not true from a political point of view.</p>
<p>Holding the Fifth National Congress The Fifth National Congress will be held as scheduled. It is heard that the Southwest has telegraphed Nanjing to express its opposition, but I have not seen the telegram myself. As for the rumor that the Southwest will also hold the Fifth National Congress in Guangzhou at the same time, it is definitely not going to happen, because Chen Jitang has strongly opposed it.</p>
<p>Zhang Xueliang Will Not Return for the Time Being Foreign telegrams claim that Zhang Xueliang will return to China before November and that the central government will give him an important position in the Aviation Administration, etc. Tang strongly denied this statement and said that when Wang (Jingwei) and Jiang (Jieshi) met in Lushan, they discussed the matter of Zhang's return to China and both advocated that Zhang should stay abroad for a long time to conduct inspections. The intention was telegraphed to Zhang. As for the rumor that Chen Mingshu will be appointed Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in the Five Eastern Provinces, I have heard of it before, but I am not very clear about the extent of the current progress.</p>
<p>French Occupation of the Nine Islands Regarding the French occupation of the nine small islands, the central government is still investigating. As for the names and locations of the nine small islands, as far as is known at present, they do not seem to be the small islands in the Xisha Islands. Therefore, a thorough investigation has been initiated. However, this work is very difficult. Once the investigation is clear, if it is indeed our country's territory, we will lodge a serious protest with France. As for the Japanese rumor that the nine small islands are Japanese territory, there is absolutely no basis for it.</p>
<h3 id="e125">The Fourteenth Group of Displaced Refugees from Mexico Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Total of Eleven People Going to Hong Kong on the Same Ship This Morning</p>
<p>The fourteenth group of eleven displaced refugees expelled from Mexico arrived in Shanghai on the President McKinley, a ship of the Dollar Steamship Lines, at around 10 a.m. yesterday. Mr. Tan Zhonglu, a special representative from the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, boarded the ship to express his condolences and distributed a large amount of food to the refugees. All the refugees spent the night on the ship and did not disembark. They are scheduled to take the same ship to Hong Kong this afternoon to return to their original homes as soon as possible. The names of all the refugees are recorded below: Yu Ding, Cao Fuyu, Yu Rucang, Chen Mingkuang, Lei Yiyao, Tang Shewei, Chen Licai (all from Taishan), Zhong Nian, Huang Qi, Huang Yao (all from Xinhui), Feng Lun (from Enping).</p>
<p>Ningo Vice Captain Wang Zhiguang</p>
<h3 id="e126">Transferred to Serve as Inspector of the Pinghai Warship <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>The Total Cost of the Warship is 8 Million Yuan</p>
<p>The Pinghai cruiser, newly built by the Ministry of the Navy, is the largest cruiser in our country's navy, along with the Ningo. Construction began in May of the 20th year of the Republic and has lasted for over a year. In the middle, due to economic reasons, the project was once suspended. Now, under the order of the Ministry, it is being expedited so that it can be launched on time. The Ministry allocates an additional 30,000 yuan per month for construction costs. The required steel plates have already been shipped from England. In order to emphasize the nuclear warship project, the Ministry of the Navy, in addition to the original inspector Zeng Guocheng, has dispatched Wang Zhiguang, Vice Captain of the Ningo warship, as the warship inspector, to assist in the supervision. Wang arrived at his post yesterday after receiving the order. The total cost of the warship is 8 million yuan in national currency.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Ningo Number One Aircraft Flew Yesterday <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Number Two Aircraft will be Completed Two Months Later</p>
<p>The reconnaissance aircraft on the Ningo cruiser, Ningo Number One, is a surface-type aircraft. The trial flight was held in the sky above Gaochang Temple on the mornings of the day before yesterday and yesterday. Naval Aviation Instructor He Jian and aviator Xu Chengqi took turns piloting, circling several times in the sky above the city and performing various techniques. The aircraft has 150 horsepower, a speed of 80 miles per hour, and an endurance of four hours. In addition, Ningo Number Two is currently being expedited by the Aircraft Manufacturing Plant and is expected to be completed in about two months. Its structure, except for the engine, which is the same as Number One, has been modified in terms of the fuselage to be a foldable type, which can be folded up and stored when not flying, which is very convenient.</p>

<h3 id="e128">Wartime Telegrams Completely Restored <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>However, Qinhuangdao Temporarily Transfers Water and Electricity Fees, and Fees Must be Doubled</p>
<p>A reporter from New Voice News met with the head of Chinese business at the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau of the Ministry of Communications yesterday. According to him, after the wartime telegrams in North China were restored by specialists sent by the Ministry, all wartime telegrams in the war zone were completely destroyed by the Japanese army and had to be repaired. Therefore, when the Japanese army withdrew, they immediately sent craftsmen to repair them. Now, the telegrams in Qinhuangdao, Beidaihe, Tangshan, and other places have all been restored. Only Shanhaiguan requires the specialist sent by the Ministry to negotiate with all parties because the Japanese army is stationed there. Although the telegrams in Shanhaiguan are still received and sent as usual, they must be transferred via water lines and the pseudo-Manchukuo, resulting in telegram fees being doubled as usual.</p>

The services provided include: (1) answering various questions, (2) selling passenger car tickets, (3) picking up and sending luggage on behalf of customers, (4) reserving sleeping berths on behalf of customers, (5) reserving hotels on behalf of customers, and (6) organizing group travel. In the shortest possible time, they will also provide services such as handling freight procedures, picking up and sending packages, and handling local specialties.</p>
<p>City General Chamber of Commerce Submits to City Government</p>
<h3 id="e130">Negotiations on Telephone Charges in Concessions <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Cancel the Temporary Contract and Reduce the Burden on Citizens</p>
<p>The Shanghai City General Chamber of Commerce submitted a request to the city government yesterday to negotiate the cancellation of telephone charges in the concessions. The original text reads: "Submission for request. It is noted that the fact that telephone users in both the Chinese and concession areas must pay an additional fee for each call is a trickery and is not found anywhere else. Since the representatives of the association and users from various industries have argued on reasonable grounds, the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications has agreed to waive it. However, the Shanghai Telephone Company in the concession has sent two letters to the association, requesting that it follow the Chinese area's method and abolish it uniformly, but has not responded. Later, the Chinese Taxpayers' Association in the concession sent a letter to the Engineering Bureau requesting that it uphold justice, saying that this matter should be discussed between the Telephone Bureau and the company. In fact, this matter has been discussed between the Telephone Bureau and the company once, but it did not yield results because the company insisted on its position. Now, it is using the excuse that the two parties should consult, which is obviously a way to shirk responsibility and delay. It is appropriate to submit this matter to your government for review and approval. Please order the Public Utilities Bureau to seriously negotiate with the telephone company and order it to immediately cancel the five-cent telephone charge to avoid users bearing unreasonable burdens, and to cancel the temporary contract that undermines sovereignty, which is for the public convenience. Respectfully submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Government."</p>
<p>City General Chamber of Commerce Sends Telegram Requesting Explanation</p>
<h3 id="e131">Can Appeals Be Made Against Illegal Penalties for Stamps? <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai City General Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Nanjing Judicial Yuan and the Supreme Court yesterday to request an explanation of whether appeals can be made in cases handled by the courts involving stamp taxes. The original text is recorded below: "To the esteemed Judicial Yuan of Nanjing and the Supreme Court, it is noted that the judicial organs, when handling cases of violations of the Stamp Tax Ordinance, do not allow appeals to be filed in accordance with the penalties and implementation rules of the ordinance's Article 4. However, this rule was implemented with the filing of the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Justice in June of the 17th year of the Republic. By the 22nd year of the Republic, the Ministry of Finance approved the adoption of Shandong Province's methods to improve the stamp tax penalty procedures, allowing penalized merchants in each county to state concrete reasons within 15 days and submit them to the provincial bureau for review by the provincial review committee. It is that cases of stamp tax penalties in each county have the right to request a review, while the judicial organs have no way to appeal, which is unreasonable. Or, it is said that the above rules have been implicitly abolished since the Ministry of Finance approved the change, but it is not known whether this view is appropriate. Furthermore, according to the interpretation of the Supreme Court and the instructions of the Ministry of Judicial Administration, if there is a violation of the law in the stamp penalty, the original court can be requested to revoke it. However, it is difficult to guarantee that there will be no preconceived notions when requesting the judge of the original court to revoke it. If the application is still rejected, is it permissible to appeal? It is a matter of great importance. If appeals are not allowed, the higher court cannot question whether the original trial has violated the law in its determination of facts and the application of the law. It is inevitable that there will be no way to correct it, which is not the original intention of the law to allow people to apply for revocation. The above two points concern the interpretation of the law and are of great importance to all the merchants in the city. It is appropriate to request the esteemed court to review and approve it, and give a legal interpretation so that it can be followed, which is for the public convenience. Sincerely, Shanghai City General Chamber of Commerce, Xiaoxiao."</p>

<p>Citizens' Association for Promoting National Products</p>
<h3 id="e133">Scheduled to Hold Re-election Congress <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Citizens' Association for Promoting National Products re-elects its members every year in accordance with its charter. This year, it has been soliciting members and instructing factory members to participate in the national goods exhibitions in Dinghai, Wenzhou, Qingdao, and Weihaiwei, and has therefore postponed the election until now. It is now known that the association's review of member qualifications has been completed.

<p>Sent a Letter to the Silver and Money Industry Association for Notification</p>
<p>The Central Mint sent a letter to the Silver and Money Industry Association and related organizations, stating, "Respectfully, after reviewing the regulations of the Mint Ordinance, this factory is allowed to cast ingots. The Shanghai financial community is also very hopeful that this project will be started soon. Therefore, this factory has been conducting a detailed study of the ingot model in recent months, and preparations are now complete. The ingot die has been manufactured and will be sent to the factory for storage within the next week. However, according to the regulations, the fineness of the ingot should be 999/1000. Since this factory refines the gas on its own, we fear that it will be difficult to achieve precision. If the local financial community wants to request this factory to cast ingots, banks should send large ingots with a fineness of 999/1000 to the Central Bank, which will forward them to this factory. We can cast ingots worth 1,000 yuan in national currency on their behalf to meet the needs of the market. This is a special letter for clarification, requesting your review and notification to all Chinese and foreign banks in the association."</p>
<p>Workers of British American Tobacco Factory</p>
<h3 id="e135">Petitioned to Party and Government Authorities Yesterday <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Demanding a Solution to the Outstanding Case</p>
<p>According to New Voice News, the Industry Union of the Cigarette Industry in the Fifth District of the city, due to the long-standing disputes at British American Tobacco, made a resolution at the Congress of Representatives to petition to the Municipal Government and the Municipal Party Committee yesterday. The Social Bureau convened a mediation, but no results were achieved.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Petitioned Yesterday Morning <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>The Industry Union of the Cigarette Industry in the Fifth District, based on a resolution of the Congress of Representatives, petitioned the Municipal Government and the Municipal Party Committee yesterday regarding the unresolved labor-management disputes at the British American Tobacco Factory, requesting arbitration. At 8 a.m. yesterday, they specially sent all members of the Executive Supervisory Committee, Chen Peide, Liu Dehua, Lou Jingguan, Zhang Ziping, Xiang Yangzhou, Hu Xiaomei, Fei Keguang, Xie Peiji, and more than 60 representatives from various departments to petition to the Municipal Government first, and then to the Municipal Party Committee with the same request.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Response from the Municipal Government <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>When petitioning at the Municipal Government, due to the large number of people, they specially selected Chen Peide, Lou Jingguan, Liu Dehua, Zhang Ziping, Fei Keguang, Hu Xiaomei, and Bao Yangzhou to meet Secretary-General Yu Hongjun on behalf of the party. They first stated that the factory formulated management rules, unjustly dismissed two new apprentice workers, failed to pay wages for the day of the strike, and seized labor education rights, etc. After several mediations by party and government authorities, there was no result because the factory's attitude was tough. They requested legal arbitration. Secretary-General Yu replied, (1) The issue of formulating management rules will be revised in principle, and a solution will be found within two weeks. (2) The case of the three new workers will be handled separately. (3) The unpaid wages for the two days will be submitted to legal arbitration in accordance with the law. (4) The school incident will be discussed again by the Social Bureau. Dai Youheng, a cadre of the People's Training Section of the Municipal Party Committee, met with them. Regarding the workers' requests, he agreed to refer to the Municipal Government's intentions and handle them jointly with the Social Bureau.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Petition to the Government <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>The Industry Union of the Cigarette Industry in the Fifth District submitted a document to the Municipal Government, stating, "Petition regarding the matter. The British American Tobacco Company's factory oppresses workers, forcing its way forward step by step, such as refusing to formulate management rules, depriving workers of their interests, refusing to recognize revisions, destroying school contracts, destroying labor education, refusing to mediate, reducing wages for the two days of the strike, refusing to pay, unjustly dismissing three new apprentice workers, refusing to reinstate them. All of the above have been secretly ordered to be mediated, but there has been no result. We request that your government arbitrate. The association has repeatedly petitioned for legal solutions on a case-by-case basis and sent personnel to petition. Unexpectedly, the unresolved cases have not been resolved, and there are constant disturbances. The factory has recently increased production, reduced working hours, disobeyed the Social Bureau's orders, refused to reinstate Fang Dangqi, worker No. 384 in the new printing and long-car workshop, obstructed the collection of membership fees in various workshops, and used running dogs to undermine unity. On the 4th of this month, worker No. 46 in the old factory's tobacco leaf department was unjustly dismissed, causing a general strike. All kinds of perverse actions are intentionally provoking the workers. Although the union has repeatedly tried to compromise, it has been unbearable. Now, the union has made a decision at an emergency congress of representatives to submit to the Municipal Government to promptly arbitrate all the unresolved cases mediated by the Social Bureau in accordance with the law, so as to show impartiality. Please record the situation, and hereby submit a report to your government, requesting that the unresolved cases be arbitrated in accordance with the law to avoid the expansion of the disturbances. I am eagerly awaiting orders. In addition to the representatives elected by the Congress of Representatives who will personally petition your government, a document to the Municipal Party Committee is submitted simultaneously and omitted here."</p>
<h3 id="e139">Submission to the Social Bureau <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Submission regarding the petition. The British American Tobacco Company's factory oppresses workers, (omitted). The workers of each workshop, after being disturbed, have repeatedly submitted petitions to your bureau for mediation. The factory's attitude is tough, and there is no result. The workers of each workshop have aroused public anger, and the expansion of disturbances is inevitable. Therefore, at the general congress of representatives on the 16th of this month, it was decided to submit to your bureau to promptly resolve all unresolved cases, except for those that have been submitted to the Municipal Government for arbitration, so as to avoid expanding the disputes. In addition to submitting a petition to the Municipal Government, it is hereby submitted.</p>
<p>The Former Anti-Japanese Association Mistakenly Seized National Products</p>
<h3 id="e140">Shanghai Battle Damage Compensation Claim <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>A Letter from the Chinese and Foreign Sundry Goods Industry to the Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>According to the New Sound Society, the Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Sundry Goods Industry Association wrote to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce stating that eleven pairs of Zhong Zhangji's domestically produced "Clear Sky Rainy Day" shoes were mistakenly confiscated by the former Anti-Japanese Association. After investigation, it was confirmed that they were domestic products and the Committee for Clearing Confiscated Goods issued a notice for their return. However, the goods were stored in the North Warehouse and were destroyed during the January 28th Incident. Therefore, the matter was reported to the Municipal Government and they were no longer to be returned. Furthermore, Wan Xixiang's shoes were confiscated, containing imported English thread, and were ruled as forfeited. The association argued that the goods had been detained for a long time, and the owner had already suffered significant losses. Now, they were not to be returned, which would particularly impact their capital. Therefore, they wrote to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce requesting that the matter be forwarded to the Municipal Government, instructing the Committee for Clearing Confiscated Goods to provide compensation. The original letter is recorded below:</p>
<p>Respectfully, we received your association's letter No. 3117 Cao, dated July 14th, which stated that on the 14th of this month, we received an order from the Municipal Government, stating that the Committee for Clearing Confiscated Goods of the former Anti-Japanese Association had submitted a report on the situation of clearing and registering confiscated goods, requesting review. Accordingly, we have checked that this case was previously submitted to the government by the association, and it was forwarded and commented upon. Now, based on the previous situation, in addition to the comment, we are issuing a copy of the submission, ordering the association to be informed, etc. A copy of the submission is attached. We are respectfully sending this letter, hoping that your association will forward it to the relevant parties mentioned therein. We eagerly await your assistance.</p>
<p>In response, we have already notified Zhong Zhangji and Wan Xixiang. Now, Zhong Zhangji has replied, stating that the eleven pairs of "Clear Sky Rainy Day" shoes stored at Ren Dachang had already received Notice No. 166 from the Committee for Clearing Confiscated Goods of the former Anti-Japanese Association, which stated that it had been resolved that they should be returned. However, due to the goods being stored in the North Warehouse and destroyed, it has been reported to the Municipal Government that they should not be returned, etc. Upon inspection, the identification of the "Clear Sky Rainy Day" shoes was clear, and it was obvious that they were made by Chinese merchants. However, the inspector acted rashly and confiscated the goods. At the time, a statement was made to the Anti-Japanese Association for their return, but the council delayed the matter, and it was not resolved. Later, it was learned that several days before the January 28th Incident, the association had transported the goods from the North Warehouse to a safe place for storage. It is assumed that the "Clear Sky Rainy Day" shoes were also among them. Now, it is known that they have been destroyed and should not be returned. We are deeply dismayed.</p>
<p>If we speak based on the facts, the fault lies with the Anti-Japanese Association, and not with the owner of the goods. This is very clear. Furthermore, merchants operating domestic goods should not suffer losses in vain. The principle of justice is difficult to accept. If we speak based on the law, "Article 767 of the Civil Code states that the owner of property may request the return of property from anyone who illegally possesses or seizes their property, and may request the removal of any obstruction to their property rights." Therefore, the ownership of the goods is granted by law, and cannot be deprived without reason. Now, the Committee for Clearing Confiscated Goods advocates selling Japanese goods to prepare for repaying the debts owed by the former Anti-Japanese Association, but disregards the non-Japanese goods that were destroyed. This is tantamount to focusing solely on the rights of the association, and not considering its obligations. This is not only unfair, but also fails to fulfill the function of clearing. Appropriate compensation should be given for the non-Japanese goods that were destroyed, so that the owner's capital is secured, and both the law and the facts are taken into consideration, so as not to cause resentment. We sincerely request that this letter be forwarded for implementation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Wan Xixiang has replied, stating that the confiscated thread is indeed a product of the British Cotton &amp; General Merchants Co. Ltd., which can be proven. To forfeit it suddenly is unfair. Upon investigation, what they stated is indeed insightful. If domestic goods are mistaken for enemy goods, it has already caused the owner to suffer from illiquidity. To not return them and cause them to lose their capital innocently, how can this be explained rationally or emotionally? If compensation can be given, it would be appropriate. Otherwise, it will cause endless complaints, which is contrary to the original intention of resisting Japan.</p>
<p>Based on the aforementioned circumstances, we have prepared this letter and respectfully submit it. We hope that your association will quickly forward it to the Municipal Government for approval and to the Committee for Clearing Confiscated Goods to handle the matter as requested. We greatly value our public duty.</p>
<p>Respectfully addressed to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce.</p>

<p>Due to the rapid rise of the Yellow River's floodwaters, the Henan and Shandong areas have already suffered significant disasters. The Xinwei Relief Association in this city has now received a request from the local authorities, demanding that personnel be immediately dispatched to provide relief. Because the chairman of the Relief Affairs Committee, Mr. Xu Shiying, is currently recuperating in Lushan, a quick telegram has been sent to inquire about the plan. It has also been decided that after receiving Mr. Xu's reply, an executive committee meeting will be convened immediately to discuss relief matters.</p>
<p>Water Recedes Slightly in Central Henan</p>
<h3 id="e142">Passenger Trains on the Pinghan Railway Have Resumed <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Due to the rising waters of the Yellow River in recent days, several spans of the Yellow River Railway Bridge on the Pinghan Railway were submerged, preventing train traffic. Yesterday, the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration received a telegram from the Pinghan Railway Management Committee stating that the floodwaters of the Yellow River in central Henan had receded slightly and that passenger trains on the Pinghan Railway had resumed operations on the 16th. However, the Yellow River Railway Bridge is leaning and has not yet been repaired, so freight trains are still not running.</p>

<p>After the new silkworm cocoons came onto the market, the silk industry in this city saw silk prices soar due to brisk sales to Europe and America, and the number of factories that resumed operations temporarily accounted for 40-50% of the total. Subsequently, sales to Europe declined again, and prices also fell. In addition, labor strikes broke out in silk factories in the Pudong and Zhabei districts, and factories successively suspended operations. By the time the wage issue was resolved, a total of only 43 silk factories citywide were operating. However, overseas silk sales remained sluggish, and the amount of silk stored in various factories increased daily. They all took advantage of the summer vacation to reduce working hours, only working half days in the morning. Now that autumn has arrived and the weather is cool, silk factories should normally resume full-day operations. However, European and American silk sales have suffered a setback, and telegrams report that silk prices are more than 200 yuan lower than the highest price in summer. Furthermore, there are no large-scale transactions, and the silk stored in various factories cannot be sold. Therefore, it is difficult for factories to return to normal operations in the short term.</p>

<p>Since the assassination of Zhao Tieqiao, the former General Manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and the attempted assassination of Song Ziwen, the Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, at the North Railway Station, which resulted in the on-the-spot death of Song's confidential secretary Tang Yulu, the important criminal involved, Niu Jinpu (also known as Niu Anru) from Anhui Province, has remained at large. Niu was the main culprit in organizing the robbery of the Songjiang branch of the Bank of China. After being arrested, he gave his name as Niu Anru and was sentenced to seven years in prison. This time, the Laozha Police Station of the Shanghai International Settlement cracked an assassination organization and arrested major criminals Wang Shuchiao, Zhou Zhizhang, Hong Yaodou, etc. It was then that they revealed that the criminal Niu's real name was Niu Jinpu. Therefore, the police station brought the criminal to the station for questioning. Unexpectedly, the Municipal Public Security Bureau also learned of this and transferred him from the First Special District Court to the bureau on the 18th of last month, stipulating that he must be sent back to the police station within three days. On the 15th of this month at 11 p.m., he escaped from the Municipal Public Security Bureau.</p>
<p>After the incident occurred, this newspaper was the first to disclose it. The news spread and shocked all of Shanghai. At that time, Director Wen not only ordered the detention of Meng Xianqi, the captain of the third squadron of the police brigade, and three squad leaders, as well as two patrolmen who were responsible for guarding the station that night, but also supervised all his subordinates to mobilize in order to crack the case immediately. However, there has been no progress in the past few days. As a result, Director Wen is extremely anxious. It is rumored that if there is still no new development in this case in the near future, Director Wen will submit a resignation and request punishment. As for the vacancy in the third squadron, Pei Chengzhu, the former adjutant, was appointed to succeed him yesterday.</p>
<p>As a remedy, the bureau has added a machine gun squad of police officers and a special inspector to rotate guard duty over the remaining three criminals, Wang Shuchiao, Zhou Zhizhang, and Hong Yaodou.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Ministry Order to Calibrate Weighing Scales <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>150 Sets to be Made</p>
<p>Issued for Use on Various Railways</p>
<p>The Joint Transportation Department of the Ministry of Railways stipulates in the Joint Transportation Regulations and the General Rules for Freight Car Transportation that excess weight of luggage and parcels within 5% and excess weight of goods within 2% are exempt from additional freight charges. However, in reality, due to the inaccuracy of the weighing scales and the cleverness of the consignors, the recorded weight of ordinary goods and freight tickets often exceeds 5%, and the excess weight of joint transportation luggage and parcels often exceeds 10%. Based on this statistic, the amount of freight losses nationwide must be alarming. Even if we take the national freight revenue and joint transportation luggage and parcel revenue for the year 20 as the standard, the annual losses due to excess weight are estimated to be over 3 million yuan. Even if we estimate it at one-third, the amount is still over one million yuan.</p>
<p>However, the reasons for the inaccuracy of the weighing scales on various railways are nothing more than the following:</p>

<p>Sentenced to Three Years Imprisonment and a Fine of 5,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Zhao Youming (also known as Zhao Yumin and Zhao Picheng), the former Yunnan negotiator, resided in Shanghai after leaving office and worked as an agent in the political department of a certain organization. He privately set up a morphine manufacturing facility on the third floor of a foreign house at No. 121 Yao Zhu Jiao Road in the French Concession. On June 11th of last year, the Chinese and foreign detectives of the French Concession police raided the facility and arrested the accomplices Hou Yunshan, Liu Mingzhang, Hou Lihe, Gan Hongfa, Jin Yushan, etc., who were taken to the police station for detention. The next day, Zhao surrendered himself to the police station, intending to plead for leniency, but he was detained and charged with initiating the Second Special District Court. After interrogation, Zhao was sentenced to three years imprisonment and a fine of 5,000 yuan. The others were sentenced to imprisonment and fines. Zhao and others disagreed and appealed to the Higher Third Branch Court, but the appeal was rejected. Zhao and others then appealed to the Supreme Court, which also rejected the appeal and upheld the original verdict. This was reported in previous newspapers.</p>
<p>It is now learned that this case has concluded after three trials and the verdict has been finalized. In the morning of the previous day, Judge Guo Dezhang of the Higher Third Branch Court opened an execution court and brought Zhao and the others to the court. After a brief interrogation, he instructed that the number of days of detention before the discount was decided and ordered them to be sent to prison for execution and to pay the fines within a limited time. After the instructions, the bailiffs escorted Zhao and the others to the Second Special District Prison on Masnan Road to carry out the following two points.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Different Types and Used for Too Long <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>1. The scales are of different types, and the employees may not be familiar with the methods of use and protection. (2) They have been used for too long and have lost their flexibility.</p>
<p>In order to remedy the above defects, the Joint Transportation Department sent technician Li Yue to investigate the Bureau of Weights and Measures of the Ministry of Industry. From the certified weighing scales and weights manufactured by the bureau, 18 items were selected. After verification, 150 sets were ordered for use at major stations. At the same time, referring to the Implementation Regulations for Weights and Measures of the Ministry of Industry and the Method for Checking Weights and Measures Instruments for Public Use, nine articles on unified railway weighing scale calibration methods were drafted and submitted to the Minister for approval. The Ministry then issued Instruction No. 6164 of the Joint Transport Department, ordering all railways to comply. The Two Railway Administrations will dispatch 20 sets of the said weights. After they are received, they will be distributed to major stations for trial use.</p>
<p>Unified Standard Weighing Scale Method</p>
<p>1. In order to unify the kilogram weighing scales at all railway stations, the Ministry of Railways has ordered the Joint Transportation Department to formulate standard weights for use at all stations. (2) Each set of standard weights consists of 18 pieces, weighing two pieces of one gram, one piece of two grams, one piece of five grams, ten pieces of one kilogram, and four pieces of ten kilograms, totaling 50 kilograms and 9 grams. In order to facilitate storage, three wooden boxes are specially made to store them separately. (3) The employees responsible for the safekeeping of the weighing scales at each station shall carefully preserve these weights and not allow them to rust, which would cause changes in weight. (4) The weighing scales shall be calibrated in accordance with the procedures for the inspection of platform scales in Article 25 of the Method for Checking Weights and Measures Instruments for Public Use of the Ministry of Industry. (5) When calibrating the weighing scales, in addition to the provisions previously stipulated, the weighing scales shall first be cleaned and checked to see if they are placed level and whether the four wheels are in contact with the ground. Then, place one one-kilogram weight on the weighing pan to check the accuracy. Then, gradually add one kilogram weights and check each kilogram. When there is a difference, it should be registered immediately. Record how many grams the weight is more or less at a certain number of kilograms. When adding up to ten kilograms, remove all the one-kilogram weights and replace them with a ten-kilogram weight. Then, use one-kilogram weights to gradually increase them one by one and check them successively. When adding up to 50 kilograms, remove all the weights and replace them with a bucket of water of the same weight or other items. Then add the weights one kilogram at a time, and so on, and the weight can be increased to any weight.</p>
<p>The Weighing Scale Used Must be Flexible</p>
<p>1. The stationmasters and weighing scale personnel at each station should study and understand the function of each part of the weighing scale, and lubricate and oil them at any time to make them flexible. If placed outdoors, they should be covered with oilcloth after use to protect them. (7) Each railway should have at least one-tenth of the reserve weighing scales stored in the repair shop for the use of each station's request for repair and replacement. When each station requests repairs, the spare weighing scale should be sent first. Once the weighing scale to be repaired is sent, it must be repaired quickly for replacement by other stations. For roads with longer routes, spare weighing scales can be stored in several places. (8) If these weights are damaged and cannot be used, each station should state the reasons and submit them to the road in charge for verification and transfer to the Joint Transportation Department for replacement. (9) If there are any matters not covered in these measures, they may be submitted to the Ministry for revision at any time.</p>
<p>Fire Conditions in this City</p>
<p>Zhabei District is More Advanced than Before the War</p>
<p>Preliminary Plan Formulated for the City Center</p>
<p>The construction of fire prevention facilities in this city has always been emphasized. Although the fire brigades in Zhabei, Jiangwan, Wusong, and other districts suffered great losses after the January 28th Incident, they have recently been restored to their original state. A reporter from the Central News Agency went to the Municipal Public Security Bureau to inquire about the current situation of fire prevention in this city. According to Dong Zhihe, director of the Fire Department of the bureau, the details are as follows:</p>
<p>Zhabei Restored to Original State</p>
<p>Originally, Zhabei District had the most successful fire prevention work in this city. Although it suffered a major blow after the Shanghai War, it has now been restored to its original state and is even more advanced than before. Zhabei District is divided into four sections, and the fire brigades in three of these sections have sophisticated equipment and skilled techniques, making them second to none in Shanghai. The fire brigade in that section originally had five pumper fire trucks, and recently ordered a new British-style pumper truck worth about 50,000 yuan. The truck is equipped with a 60-foot-high ladder, so even if the tallest buildings are on fire, the fire brigade in that section can still go to the rescue. In addition, the Zhabei Fire Brigade Association has recently purchased an ambulance, which is also very well equipped and is specially prepared for the rescue of victims in the event of a fire. Since it was put into trial use, the results have been excellent.</p>
<p>Gradual Expansion in Various Districts</p>
<p>As for the Hubei South District, it remains in its normal state. The Gaoqiao and Yangjing districts still use old-fashioned fire-fighting equipment due to various reasons. However, the bureau is actively trying to expand and reform them. The Lan Ni Du area of ​​Pudong has a dense population and frequent fires. Although the fire-fighting equipment used is more complete than the two districts mentioned above, it cannot achieve great results due to the inconvenience of water supply. The original fire-fighting equipment in Wusong District was almost completely destroyed in the January 28th Incident, but a new-style pumper fire truck and more than 1,000 feet of leather hose have now been purchased. It will be gradually expanded in the future. Fire prevention in the city center is also being planned, but due to the shortage of municipal funds, the preliminary plan can only be simplified. Fire hydrants will first be installed in places where there are water pipes on various roads, and then a fire brigade will be organized in the area. In the future, it is also planned to transfer some fire-fighting equipment and firefighters from Zhabei District to serve in the area. In addition, the municipal government will allocate several thousand yuan to purchase other essential equipment.</p>
<p>Cracking Down on Incendiary Residents</p>
<p>Because Chinese and foreigners live together in this city and people's hearts are not united, there are often cases of deliberate arson in order to seek illicit wealth. Therefore, the bureau has now drafted registration rules for fire insurance customers to strictly prevent this kind of malpractice. If such incidents occur, they will be severely punished. The rules have now been submitted to the municipal government for review.</p>
<p>In addition, there are so-called "public assessment firms" in this city, which are entrusted by insurance companies. Whenever insured customers encounter fire insurance, they are led by Westerners and several workers to go to the fire site to steal and move items from the households. However, this often leads to the mistaken removal of items from non-insured households, and even hinders fire-fighting work. Therefore, the bureau has recently formulated rules for the collection of public assessment firms at fire sites to restrict them. Once approved and announced by the municipal government, they will be implemented immediately.</p>
<p>Chinese Woman from Kobe Smuggles Gold Bars</p>
<h3 id="e150">Embezzled by Handlers <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Gold Bars Worth 16,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Sold for Only 7,400 Yuan for Distribution</p>
<p>｜All Persons Involved Arrested One After Another｜</p>
<p>A woman named Huang Jiang opened a restaurant in Kobe, Japan, and accumulated wealth. Recently, because Japan banned the export of gold, the price of gold was lower than elsewhere. The woman secretly sold gold bars to seek huge profits. On June 29th of this year, the American Da Lai Foreign Firm's world liner "Hayes" set sail from Kobe and sailed to Shanghai. Huang Jiang entrusted seven gold bars worth 16,000 yuan to Zhao Chunbao, a typist on the ship, to take to Shanghai and instructed him to give them to Zhu A Cai for receipt. On July 3rd, the Hayes arrived in port. Unexpectedly, Zhao became greedy and embezzled the gold goods with Feng and Ji Li, an old woman in her sixties who lived at No. 343 Xin Tang Jia Lane. The woman's husband, Ji Chunyuan, secretly sold them, obtaining 7,400 yuan for distribution.</p>
<p>Recently, Huang Jiang learned of this and entrusted Heng Rongbao, who worked with Zhao Chunbao, to investigate. Heng learned that Zhao was hiding in the local government district. On the previous day, he reported it to the Municipal Public Security Bureau, which dispatched detective leader Gu Liancheng and detectives Hu Kuisheng and Gong Fujin to rush to the scene and arrest Zhao. According to his confession, Feng was also living in the same house as Ji Li. Detective Gu and others contacted the Concession Police and dispatched patrolman Ji Xiucai to go to the address to arrest him. However, Feng had heard the news and escaped, and only Ji Li was arrested. Yesterday, they were sent to the First Special District Court, where Judge Liu Yugui interrogated them. Detective Gu brought the suspect Zhao to the court and requested permission to bring Ji Li back to the Public Security Bureau for investigation. However, the police station's lawyer, Wang Yaotang, requested that the woman be temporarily detained, saying that the content of this case was extremely complex, not only involving gold bars, but also possibly involving the abduction and sale of people. Therefore, the police station needs to conduct a detailed investigation. Moreover, the Public Security Bureau's request for transfer has not yet been formally received by the court, and the procedures are still lacking. He requested that Ji Li be sent to prison for investigation. Judge Liu then approved the detention and postponed the hearing for seven days, pending further review after the Public Security Bureau's written request.</p>

<h3 id="e152">Renewed Street Light Contract with Yappuer <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>The Public Works Bureau has always used foreign goods for street lights in the city. In 19, the former director Huang Boqiao found that the domestic Yappuer light bulbs were of very good quality and could match foreign goods. Therefore, the street lights were changed to use Yappuer bulbs. It has been several years and they have been quite satisfied. Recently, as the contract expired, the bureau collected various light bulbs and had experts conduct precise tests. The results showed that the Yappuer bulbs were still in the lead. Therefore, Section Chief Zheng Baocheng notified the factory to renew the contract. The contract was formally signed by Director Xu Peihuang and Hu Xiyuan, the general manager of the Yappuer factory, a few days ago.</p>
<p>Special Tobacco Tax Facilitates Merchants</p>
<p>Susong Tobacco Industry Requests Exceptional Supplement</p>
<p>Rejected by the Consolidated Tax Office Yesterday</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance's Consolidated Tax Office changed the tobacco leaf tax to a special tax and the liquor tax to a fixed amount tax, which has been implemented since July 1st. Although the merchants once expressed dissent, there was no problem. The Susong Tobacco Industry Association and others requested that the newly ordered special tax rate for domestic tobacco leaves be exceptionally supplemented, which was also rejected by the office yesterday and was widely informed to all places. The order is as follows:</p>
<p>In order to implement the order, we have now received a joint telegram from the Susong Tobacco Industry Association and others, requesting that the newly ordered special tax rate for domestic tobacco leaves be supplemented exceptionally to alleviate the merchants' difficulties, etc. The abolition of public sales fees and taxes and the implementation of special taxes for domestic tobacco leaves in the seven provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Henan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Fujian were originally intended to simplify the process and facilitate merchants. The special tax rate set at 4 yuan and 1 jiao and 5 fen per 100 catties of national currency is nothing more than a merger of the previous collection of public sales fees and taxes, unified collection, and sales anywhere in the special tax area after one collection is sufficient, without repeated collection. The customs transit tax is also allowed to be waived.</p>
<p>The Provisional Regulations for the Collection of Special Tax on Domestic Tobacco Leaves have been promulgated by the Ministry and distributed to the competent bureaus and offices of each province, and shall be followed uniformly from July 1st of this year. Compared with the previous public sales fee and tax, which was based on the province as a unit, if the tobacco leaves were transported to other provinces for sale after the public sales fee and tax had been collected at the production and sales location, the fee and tax still had to be paid in the sales province. It is very clear that it benefits tobacco merchants. How can the merchants misunderstand and want to change the tax system based on the special situation of tobacco leaf production and sales in a corner of the country?</p>
<p>In response to the telegram, we are copying the original telegram and ordering you to inform and notify it immediately. This order.</p>

<h3 id="e153">Rent Reduction for Houses Along the Road <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Tongren Fuyuan Hall Sympathizes with Tenants</p>
<p>The houses along Bali Bridge Road and Ningbo Road in the French Concession are owned by Tongren Fuyuan Hall. After the houses were rebuilt last year, most of the houses along Ningbo Road were established as hospitals, while those along Bali Bridge Road were mostly small inns and shops selling groceries, tobacco, paper, and food. Since then, due to the sluggish market in recent years, it has been difficult for the tenants to maintain their current situation by paying such high rents. They have repeatedly convened all the tenants to discuss and request the landlord to reduce the rent burden. After months of negotiations, the landlord has now found that the market is indeed sluggish and has agreed to accept the rent reduction terms.</p>
<p>It is reported that as a result of the negotiations, the original rent of each house along Bali Bridge Road was 80 yuan, but it has now been reduced by 20 yuan to 60 yuan per house. The rents set for the houses along Ningbo Road were not uniform at the time because the houses were of different sizes. It is now agreed to reduce them by 20 percent. The original rent was 100 yuan (proportional), but now 80 yuan will be charged. Yesterday afternoon, the tenants convened a final meeting and were all satisfied, believing that their request for rent reduction had been victorious.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Passenger Dies on Shanghai-Hangzhou Train <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Cheng Yunhuan, a 40-year-old man from Anhui Province who resided at No. 354 Zhao Jia Road, worked as a waiter at the Zui Hong Lou restaurant in the Yimiao area of Fangbang Road. He usually left home early and returned late, which was his habit. However, because Cheng Yunhuan had been doing business in Shanghai for many years and had not yet returned to his hometown, he missed his hometown very much. Therefore, he and his wife, Cheng Zhang (34 years old), took a rickshaw to the South Railway Station at 7:00 a.m. yesterday, carrying luggage and bought two third-class train tickets to Hangzhou at 7:50 a.m. to return to their hometown. Unexpectedly, Cheng had just boarded the train and sat down when his face suddenly turned pale, he muttered to himself, became unconscious, and barely breathed. Suddenly, his mouth became fixed and his eyes were blank, and he died on the train.</p>
<p>When the railway police saw this, they carried the body down, and the train started to move. They immediately notified the Gaochangmiao Branch of the Second District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and reported to the court to inspect the body. They also forwarded the previous situation to the district chief Jin Tian and submitted it to the General Bureau for record.</p>

<p>The claim is unclear and litigation fees have not been paid, so the court cannot hear the case. Zhu Jing'an, from Anhui, has been engaged in the cotton yarn and oil business in Shanghai for many years and is currently the general manager of Shun Yu Li Tai and two other companies. Two years ago, his younger sister, Hong Zhu Yunxiang, filed a civil lawsuit with the First Special District Court, claiming to be settling their father Zhu Zhiren's property. After repeated court hearings and joint inquiries, it was concluded that there was no basis for the claim. Zhu Zhiren himself appeared in court to explain the facts, so the plaintiff lost the case. Hong Zhu Yunxiang then appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court and the Supreme Court, but all appeals failed. Hong Zhu Yunxiang later died of illness. Recently, Hong Zhu Yunxiang's heirs, Hong Gui Bao, etc., suddenly filed another civil lawsuit with the First Special Court against Zhu Jing'an, claiming to determine ownership. The court approved the petition and held a hearing yesterday. The defendant also hired a lawyer to appear in court. Judge Shen Hong briefly questioned the plaintiff's intentions, but because the plaintiff's claim was unclear and the litigation fees had not been paid, the trial could not proceed. The plaintiff was ordered to pay the litigation fees within one week, and a new hearing date will be set later.</p>

<p>Shao Deliang, from Ningbo, was 32 years old and lived at No. 104 Taoyuan Lane, Pei'er Road. He used to run a restaurant in Japan. After the September 18th Incident, Shao left Japan and returned to China. Unfortunately, he has not been able to find suitable employment in Shanghai, resulting in extreme financial hardship. In addition, he recently suffered from severe boils on his head and other areas. Shao felt the pain of poverty and illness, and felt that life was no longer enjoyable. Overcome with resentment, he had thoughts of ending his life. He went alone to Bao Fa Hotel at No. 7 Qingyang Lane, Huishan Road, booked room No. 16, and committed suicide by taking sleeping pills. The hotel tea servant discovered this and immediately sent him to Tongren Hospital for treatment, but he died shortly after. The hospital reported this to the Huishan Police Station, which ordered detective Zhao Chengqing to investigate. The body was then taken to the autopsy station on Feilun Road. Yesterday morning, Zhang Junqing, a prosecutor appointed by the First Special District Court, arrived at the station to examine the body. After confirming the body, he began the official inquiry. Shao Zhou, the deceased's wife, testified about the past. Zhang Jun then declared that the deceased, Shao Deliang, had indeed died of poisoning. The body was released to his wife, Shao Zhou, after she signed a guarantee to retrieve the coffin.</p>
<p>Sentenced for Assault and Battery After Failed Loan Attempt</p>
<p>Chen Yunti, from Changzhou, used to work at the Da Lun Silk Factory at No. 36 Hongqing Lane, Baoding Road. Recently, he was dismissed from his job due to excessive gambling and prostitution and became unemployed. Due to financial difficulties, at around 7:00 AM the day before yesterday, he went to the Da Lun Silk Factory to borrow 3,000 yuan from his former teacher, Lu Weixia from Danyang, claiming that he wanted to open a silk factory. When the loan was denied, he became angry and slapped Lu in the face and tried to punch him. Lu was old and could not defend himself, so he went upstairs to avoid him. Zhou Mingde, a Danyang native who managed the warehouse, came out to mediate, but Chen, without asking why, grabbed an iron object from the side and struck Zhou's head violently. Zhou fell to the ground in extreme pain. Someone called for Chinese constable No. 1368, who arrested Chen and brought him and the weapon to the Huishan Police Station. The injured Zhou was sent to Tongren Hospital, where doctors found that the injuries were minor and not life-threatening. Yesterday morning, the police station sent Chen Yunti to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court, where Judge Wu Zehan conducted a preliminary hearing. Zhang Tianyin, the police station's lawyer, stated the facts of the case and requested an investigation. The plaintiff, Lu Weixia, and witness Zhou Mingde appeared in court to testify about the defendant's actions at the time and hired lawyer Fan Gang to request leniency. When questioned, the defendant's statements were evasive. After reviewing the statements, Judge Wu sentenced Chen Yunti to three months in prison as a warning.</p>
<p>Flower Game King</p>
<h3 id="e157">Yi Fugen and Others Prosecuted <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Yi Fugen, known as "Hemp Skin" Yi Fugen, the Flower Game King of Fangbanqiao, and his disciple Tang A'bao, known as "Bao Hua" A'bao, were charged in the District Court for injuring police officer Liu Wanxiang and others from the first sub-station of the second district, as previously reported. It is now known that after Yi's arrest, the prosecutor ordered police officers and bailiffs to investigate Yi's large betting operation, which was located in Houdafang Lane, Fangbanqiao, with a listening post located at Menshang, Yongquan Lane, marked with Yi's sign. Two branch betting locations were also set up at Laobeimen, with the sign "Yao Ji." This confirmed that Yi was a major gambling offender. In addition, the large listening post at Wanshengqiao and the large Flower Game factory at Foji Yesanguantang were merged with Yi's large factory. Currently, Mian Dian, Hai Song, Hu Dahai, and someone named Jin are acting as managers, harming people. When investigations or crackdowns occur, they preemptively hire ruffians to act as owners and take the blame. Therefore, those who arrest make the arrest and those who operate continue to operate, with no peace ever. Unless local authorities strictly prohibit it, there is no way to eliminate these cunning activities. If these rabbit holes can be stopped, then the gambling trend can be slightly curbed. Therefore, after receiving the report, the prosecutor has filed a public lawsuit against Yi Fugen and Tang A'bao under Articles 280 and 293 of the Criminal Code, requesting strict investigation and punishment. Tang A'bao is still at large and a warrant has been issued for his arrest. The major factories involved in the Flower Game are currently being investigated by the police to find the addresses of the main offenders in order to arrest them and eliminate the scourge.</p>

<h3 id="e158">Drug Trafficking Appeal Pending Judgment <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Two Polish nationals, Vinski (transliteration) and Xibonski (transliteration), previously asked translator Ding Shouxiang to find customers to sell the drug heroin, hoping to defraud money. Wang Zhihao, Chinese detective No. 85 of the French Concession Police, learned of this and pretended to be a buyer. On June 3rd, he invited the two Polish nationals and Ding to Tianjin Apartment in Chengqing Lane, Bair Road, French Concession, to negotiate the purchase of 15 kilos, priced at 15,000 yuan. They agreed to deliver the goods and pay on the 7th. On the due date, Detective Wang reported to the Western Detective Chief, who, along with Western detectives, rushed to the apartment to wait. The two Polish nationals indeed arrived with Ding in a car, bringing seven jars of genuine goods and a wooden box containing 585 pounds of mackerel (falsely represented as heroin). They urgently demanded payment, and were all arrested and taken to the police station and sent to the Second Special District Court, accused of drug trafficking and fraud. They were sentenced to three months in prison and fined 400 yuan each for jointly selling opium substitutes. Ding Shouxiang was sentenced to two months in prison and fined 30 yuan for assisting in the sale. The rest of the charges were acquitted. These details have been previously reported. Now, it is known that Vinski and Xibonski have appealed the original judgment and hired Russian lawyer Wei Wei to file an appeal with the Third Branch of the High Court. Yesterday morning, Presiding Judge Zhou, along with Judges Guo and Chu, Prosecutor Zhang, held a joint hearing. The police station was represented by lawyer Fei Xizhen, and appellant Vinski was bailed out and appeared in court with his lawyer. Xibonski was brought from the detention center. The two men denied selling drugs, claiming that Ding Shouxiang brought the seven jars of heroin, etc. Wang Zhihao, the detective in charge of the case, described the process of handling the case at the time. After mutual arguments between the police lawyer and the appellant's lawyer, the court declared the debate closed and scheduled a date for sentencing.</p>
<p>Tragic Drowning While Swimming at the Beach</p>
<p>Liu Huayue, an 18-year-old student from Suzhou Provincial High School, came to Shanghai during the summer vacation. Yesterday afternoon, he visited his school friends Nie Xiguang and Liu Hui at the Merchant Marine School in Wusong Paotaiwan. Because the school was located by the sea, Liu Huayue suddenly felt like swimming. Liu Hui accompanied him to the beach. At first, he floated in the shallow water, fully enjoying his flexible movements. Then he jumped into the deep water and did not resurface for a long time. Liu Hui saw this and immediately went to look for him underwater. He dragged him to the beach, but he was already breathless. Artificial respiration was ineffective, and he died. Nie Xiguang telegraphed Liu Huayue's family in Songjiang to collect the body. The local security guard, Cao Shoushan, reported the death to the court for examination.</p>

<p>Zhao Hehai, a 54-year-old tailor from Nanhui, lived in Wu He Xing Bean Curd Shop at No. 2244 Haige Road, French Concession. He had a smoking habit. On the evening of the 17th (the day before yesterday), he went alone to the "Swallow's Nest" opened by someone named Li at No. 22 Xiaoyou Lane, Beidang Road, Xujiahui, to indulge in his habit. The French Concession Police learned of this and, at 11:00 PM, Western and Chinese detectives went to surround and arrest the suspects, detaining the female owner and three smokers. At that time, Zhao panicked and fled to the pavilion room upstairs. He jumped out of the window to escape, but was tripped by an electric wire, causing him to fall headfirst to the ground, injuring his head and losing consciousness. The detectives sent him to Guangci Hospital for treatment by car. They took the arrested smokers to the police station to be sent to court for trial. However, Zhao died in the hospital at 1:00 AM due to his serious injuries. The hospital notified the police station to transport the body to the autopsy station at Tongren Fuyuan Branch to wait for the Second Special District Court to send someone to examine it today. At the same time, they will investigate and summon family members to claim the body for burial.</p>

<p>Zhang Heshan, the police chief of the South Station Road Police Station of the Second District Headquarters of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, is usually serious about his service and does not show favoritism. Recently, someone accused him of extorting donations from villagers. Director Wen of the Public Security Bureau is conducting a thorough investigation. However, 40 shops on Station Road, such as Lu Gao Jian Meat Shop, Hong Qing Lou Restaurant, Chang Ji Rice Shop, Bao Qing Silver Shop, Hong De Tang Pharmacy, San Xin Store, Zhi Cheng Rice Shop, Tong Yong Feng Wine Shop, Wan Tai Tea Shop, Fu Tai Chang Hotel, Wang Zhi Da, Yong He Xiang, etc., believe that the police chief was falsely accused by a few vagrants who resented the police chief's impartiality.

<p>Police Arrest Gamblers</p>
<h3 id="e161">Verdict in the Case of Drowning Villager <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>In the case of the drowning of villager Zhu Quanlin, which occurred on the afternoon of June 23rd this year in Huijiao, a place in the western township of this county, when the police arrested gamblers, Zhang Rong, the director of the Maqiao Township Public Security Bureau, patrol leader Xie Fengshan, and police officers Jiang Shouen, Xu Enpei, Hua Ke Gong, and Wang Lizhang, were all investigated by the District Court Prosecutor's Office and prosecuted for murder. The debate has ended and the verdict is awaited. It is now known that Judge Yang Qianchang specially opened the Third Court yesterday to announce the verdict. After taking his seat at 10:00 AM, he ordered the detention of Zhang Rong, Xie Fengshan, Jiang Shouen, and Xu Enpei, as well as Hua Ke Gong and Wang Lizhang, who were out on bail, to be brought to the case. After a brief interrogation, he announced the verdict in court. Xie Fengshan and Jiang Shouen were each sentenced to one year of imprisonment for joint negligence causing death. Zhang Rong, as a bureau member, had the responsibility of command and supervision and could not escape blame. He and Hua Ke Gong were each fined 200 yuan. Xu Enpei and Wang Lizhang were both acquitted. As for the private prosecution, a judgment of 1,000 yuan was awarded, to be borne jointly by Xie Fengshan, Jiang Shouen, Zhang Rong, and Hua Ke Gong, each responsible for 250 yuan. The judge said, "The deceased, Zhu Quanlin, had an 83-year-old mother above him and a wife and three daughters below him, a family of five who depended on the deceased for their livelihood. For the sake of prudence, this court repeatedly conducted on-site investigations to clarify the facts. The bereaved family requested 2,120 yuan in compensation, which was not too much. Now, this court has decided to award 1,000 yuan. If anyone is dissatisfied with the judgment, they may appeal." He then ordered Xie Fengshan, Zhang Rong, and Jiang Shouen to be taken back into custody. Xu Enpei was sent to the Prosecutor's Office for temporary detention. Hua Ke Gong and Wang Lizhang were returned to their original guarantors.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Sandboat Encounters Wind and Robbery <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Cargo Looted</p>
<p>One Crew Member Killed</p>
<p>The Beiyang class "Gong Shun Li" sandboat of Jiangyin Peng Yue Ji Sandboat Company recently loaded northern goods such as salted fish from Shanghai Yi Tai Xiang Ji and other companies in Andong Dalian and set sail for Shanghai. On the afternoon of the 11th of this month, when sailing to the Qingkou Shidao Mountain sea area, a hurricane struck, and the waves crashed against the boat. Two crew members working on the bow were swept away by the waves. The boat owner, Yang Bao, saw this and immediately instructed the helmsman to sail towards the coast. The boat was already close to the coast, when a Qingji steamship also sailed towards the coast, coming head-on. Seeing this, the steamship quickly turned the rudder to avoid it, but the Qingji steamship was traveling fast and collided with the left side of the bow of the "Gong Shun Li." Boat owner Yang Bao inspected the boat and saw that the bow was slightly damaged, but not severely, so he sailed to the coast to anchor. After the wind and waves calmed down, he set sail again. However, after sailing past Shidao Mountain, the bow of the boat was shaken by the waves, and the place where the bow had been hit gradually flooded. When they realized it, the bow cabin was already flooded to a height of five or six feet. The crew was extremely frightened. Boat owner Yang immediately ordered the sails to be lowered and anchored there to observe. There were several cracks in the collision site. He instructed the crew members to use leather belts to pump the water out of the cabin in order to repair the cracks and stop the water. After two days, the repairs were not yet complete. Unexpectedly, on the afternoon of the 13th, near dark, two large three-masted pirate ships suddenly arrived. There were fifty or sixty pirates on board, who swarmed onto the boat, carrying guns and crowding into boat owner Yang's room, demanding that he hand over the silver dollars. Seeing the large number of pirates, Yang had no choice but to hand over more than six hundred silver dollars. The pirates then searched the crew members one by one, taking all the silver dollars. Still not satisfied, they opened the cargo hold and forced the crew members to load the cargo onto the two pirate ships. One crew member was unable to carry cargo due to illness and was shot to death by the pirates. The cargo was looted and loaded onto the two pirate ships. The pirates all jumped onto the pirate ships and sailed away. Boat owner Yang arrived in Shanghai yesterday by steamer and reported to Yi Tai and other companies that the cargo had been looted, worth more than 40,000 yuan. Yi Tai and other companies have now telegraphed the relevant naval and land authorities to arrest and investigate the matter.</p>
<p>Brothers Quarrel, Bloodshed Ensues</p>
<p>Qu Qiming, a 53-year-old from Haimen, rented a room at No. 63 Jiangwan Road and worked as a garden worker. He had two sons, the eldest named Pin Cai, 30 years old, who made a living pulling a rickshaw, and the younger named Pin Fu, 19 years old, who worked as a tough laborer carrying cowhide. Pin Cai was addicted to alcohol and would often get drunk, acting like a fool or a madman, often cursing and beating his younger brother Pin Fu, which was a common occurrence. Pin Fu was weak and often endured his brother's aggression without arguing. Yesterday morning, at around 6:00 AM, Pin Cai got up and drank alcohol, and then abused Pin Fu again. At that time, Pin Fu could not bear it any longer and grabbed a watermelon knife from the table and slashed horizontally, cutting his brother Pin Cai's left ear in two and injuring his face. The injury was severe, and blood gushed out. His father heard the alarm and reported it to the Diswei Road Police Station, which sent Chinese constable No. 3018 to the scene. He sent the injured person to Tongren Hospital for treatment by ambulance.</p>

<p>The War Zone Disaster Relief Association hired the Chinese National Martial Arts Circus to perform in Shanghai for half a month, which expired yesterday. However, the show has been sold out every night around 9:00 PM, so there are still many box office tickets that have not been used. Therefore, it has been agreed with the circus to extend the show for another half a month. All daytime ticket prices will be reduced by 40% to alleviate the congestion of the night shows.</p>
<p>Woman Suspects Husband of Having an Affair</p>
<h3 id="e163">Suicide by Poison After an Argument <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Chen Miao, a 39-year-old woman from Yangzhou, committed suicide by poison after an argument with her husband. Her husband, Chen Dechun, worked as a servant for a foreigner at No. 71 Hongye Garden on Yuyuan Road. As a result, the couple resided there. Recently, Mrs. Chen suspected her husband of having an affair with a maid named Wang Ji. On the morning of the previous day at around 9:00 AM, the two had a major argument. After the quarrel, Mrs. Chen became resentful and despondent, developing a desire to end her life. Seizing an opportunity, she went out and purchased opium, which she secretly swallowed. Her husband discovered this and rushed her to the Red Cross Hospital, then transferred her to Baolong Hospital for treatment. However, the treatment was ineffective, and she succumbed to the poison at around 8:00 PM that evening. The hospital reported the death to the Jing'an Temple police station. Detective Cui Buyun was dispatched to investigate. The body was then taken to Feilun Road for an examination. The following morning, the First Special District Court was notified and appointed Prosecutor Zhang Junqing to conduct an autopsy. According to the testimony of her husband, Chen Dechun, 42 years old, he had not had any improper relations with Wang Ji. He also stated that his wife had been pregnant for four months but had a miscarriage. Recently, she had been feeling unwell and wanted money for medical expenses. However, he had given all his wages to her and told her he had no money to give. This led to the argument. After hearing the testimony, Prosecutor Zhang ruled that Chen Miao had indeed died from opium poisoning. The body was released to her husband, Chen Dechun, to be placed in a coffin and buried after he signed a guarantee.</p>

<p>Famous Indian Fish Circus Arrives in Shanghai</p>
<p>In recent years, the entertainment industry has seen increasing innovation. We have become accustomed to circuses, dog shows, flea circuses, and animal shows and no longer find them surprising. Now, a so-called "fish circus" has arrived from India, making its debut in China. Commanded by a British man named Aralamania (transliteration), it features several exotic fish. These fish are very different from those commonly seen in our country and are highly combative. Upon contact, they are relentless and fight fiercely, displaying a wide range of fighting techniques, including earth-shattering and mountain-overturning maneuvers. These fighting styles are rare and remarkable even to modern zoologists. It is said that they gave an informal performance at the Royal Theatre in England a few years ago. The audience, consisting of British nobles, paid exorbitant prices to request a performance by the fish circus. All were astounded, speechless, and filled with endless wonder. The troupe passed through Hong Kong and has now arrived in Shanghai, staying temporarily at the Cangzhou Hotel. They plan to perform at a major theater in Shanghai in the near future. It is expected that the price will be high, but the people of Shanghai, driven by curiosity, will empty the streets to compete for a viewing.</p>

<p>Jiangnan College Seeks Expansion</p>
<p>▲ Remarks by Dean Lin Zhongke</p>
<p>Jiangnan College in this city, since Chen Lifu, Wu Xingya, and others joined as directors, has been striving to expand its content and development. Recently, enrollment has been very enthusiastic. According to Dean Lin Zhongke, the various specialized departments offered by the college this term, such as rural economics and reclamation, are not available at any other universities in Shanghai, and they are urgently needed at present. China's rural economy is on the verge of bankruptcy. We believe that to save China, we must first save the countryside. To save the countryside, talent is the first priority. Therefore, we have spared no effort to establish such departments. Also, Chinese people are inherently fond of going to lively places, such as the Northeast and the border regions. There are many businesses to be done there, but no one cares about them. This is the purpose of the establishment of these departments. Other departments such as municipal administration, accounting, and education are also important. Therefore, we have paid special attention to the enrollment of specialized departments recently. In other words, the most important criterion for admission is the applicant's ideology.</p>

<p>Zhengfeng College of Arts, located at No. 1 Jiaozhou Road in Shanghai, has purchased more than ten mu of land opposite Zhongshan Road at the intersection of Jiaotong Road this year and is actively preparing to build school buildings.

Therefore, it has added a Department of History and Geography and hired Chen Yixian, the former editor of the Editorial Office of the Ministry of Education in Beijing, as the department head. Mr. Chen has years of experience in reviewing history and geography textbooks and has served as a professor at various universities in Peiping. He has rich knowledge and experience.

<p>▲China Wins Two Against the United States▲</p>
<h3 id="e174">▲Zheng Zhaojia Wins Against Skuyar <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>This set started at 3:00 PM. Little Zheng won the first and second sets quite easily, both with scores of 6-1. Skuyar's serves often resulted in double faults, reducing his original power. Zheng Zhaojia, on the other hand, was full of energy, able to reduce errors, and used his intelligence to win. Combined with strong smashes, he showed that his tennis skills have made considerable progress. However, Zheng surprisingly lost the third set with a score of 1-6, which is truly strange, reducing the audience's confidence. Perhaps Zheng thought victory was guaranteed, and deliberately prolonged the match to satisfy his "tennis desire"? The fourth set was completed in one go with five games, and in the fifth game, Zheng was serving, and was initially down 0-40, but then won five consecutive points to recapture the game, which was not easy. In the sixth game, Zheng deliberately hit the ball into the net, giving away a game. However, Skuyar then won the next two games, finally ending the set 6-3.</p>

However, Wang indulged in his steady and honest attitude, and showed arrogance and contempt for the enemy, in order to gain the audience's cheers, which is regrettable for Wang. Wang is already a first-class player, and should pay attention to the fact that tennis is a gentleman's competition. Hopefully, Wang will strive to improve. As for the match between the two, Smith is far from being Wang Wenzheng's opponent. Winning eighteen consecutive games would have been possible, but to avoid embarrassing his opponent too much, Wang deliberately gave away six games. The result is as follows:</p>
<p>6-2</p>
<p>Wang Wenzheng (China) 6-3 Smith (USA)</p>
<p>6-1</p>
<p>▲Japan and Portugal Each Win One Set▲</p>
<h3 id="e175">▲Corassa Wins Against Machida with Strength <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>Corassa and Machida's skills can be said to be evenly matched and difficult to distinguish. If Machida cannot win against Corassa in three straight sets, then he will definitely be defeated by Corassa. This is because Machida's physique is weak and he is not good at long battles, while Corassa is a famous jockey at sea, with a strong body, fast running speed, and rich endurance. At the end of the five sets, Corassa still showed no signs of fatigue. Corassa was able to save the ball regardless of whether it was short or long distance, but his control was still lacking, with many balls hitting the net or going out of bounds. Machida won the first and third sets, but in the fourth set, Corassa won 6-1. In the fifth set, after Machida took the first game, he lost six consecutive games. Machida was exhausted and tired of running.</p>
<p>3-6</p>
<p>6-3</p>
<p>H. Corassa (Portugal) 3-6 Machida (Japan)</p>
<p>6-1</p>
<p>6-1</p>
<p>▲Sudo Easily Takes Marcel</p>
<p>Another singles match between Japan and Portugal was Sudo vs. Marcel. Sudo used a rubber band-like smash, making it difficult for Marcel to respond. If he used force, the ball often went out of bounds. If he soft-smashed, he could not defeat his opponent. There was no certainty in net interceptions either. The first and third sets were relatively even, but Marcel ultimately had no chance of winning. Sudo won the second set very easily. The scores are as follows:</p>
<p>6-4</p>
<p>Sudo (Japan) 6-1 Marcel (Portugal)</p>
<p>6-4</p>
<p>▲Two Doubles Matches Today▲</p>
<p>Today is the doubles match. China will send Zheng Zhaojia and Yu Tianguang. Zheng and Yu are old partners, and have repeatedly shown their skills in the grass court league. They have very few flaws. Both are talented in doubles. There is still hope for victory against the American duo of Skuyar and Smith today. The match between Japan and Portugal will determine the right to advance to the final, because they each won a singles set yesterday, and Corassa (Portugal) will definitely be able to defeat Sudo of Japan, and Machida (Japan) will also definitely win against Marcel (Portugal). Therefore, the winner of today's doubles match will determine the right to advance to the final. It is truly a battle of strength between the two countries. The Portuguese players are set to be S. Corassa and Costan, while the Japanese players have yet to be decided. The schedule is as follows:</p>
<p>S. Corassa and Costan (Portugal) vs. Kimura and Fujii or Noguchi and Matsunaga (Japan) starting at 3:00 PM</p>
<p>Zheng Zhaojia and Yu Tianguang (China) vs. Smith and Skuyar (United States) at 4:30 PM</p>

The YMCA's world-class breaststroke champion, Mr. Sheng Tou, has returned to the United States. What is to be feared is Mr. Haite Lai, who recently came to Shanghai from the United States and is the American school champion. He will be participating in the 50-yard and 100-yard freestyle events this year, and his strength is strong. The Japanese team, except for Tanaka, are all handsome young men under the age of 20, and they are not willing to be careless.

<h3 id="e182">Too Much and Too Little Courage <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— Pei Yu</p>
<p>"Excess and deficiency" are not good, "too much" and "too little" are not good. Which is worse, "excess" and "too much," or "deficiency" and "too little?" That is difficult to determine. Most people always think this way: "deficiency" and "too little" are comparatively worse.</p>
<p>This view cannot be praised! Too little courage! This is the cry of many among us. Mr. Zhang San wants to be an artist, but his father opposes it and forces him to be an engineer. If he fails as an engineer, he will have the self-deprecating self-comfort of "if I had been an artist, I would definitely have soared." Miss Li Si wants to be a singer and dancer, but is prevented by her family and cannot fulfill her wish, resulting in the burial of her talent. In this situation, it is indeed "too little" that is comparatively worse.</p>
<p>In fact, "too much" is not necessarily less bad, especially in terms of courage. Too much courage easily destroys inherent aspirations completely. The harm of "too much" is many times greater than the harm of "too little"! Others did not dare to harm Yue Fei, but Qin Hui dared greatly and especially. Others did not want to declare themselves emperors, but Yuan Shikai had a great courage. Others did not have the courage to sign treaties that lost power and humiliated the country, but Li Hongzhang had so much courage that it could not be suppressed. In this situation, it is indeed "too much" that is comparatively worse.</p>
<p>Resisting violent enemies, charging into battle, this kind of courage, only worry about it being "too little," not worry about it being "too much." Enduring humiliation and not being willing to strive forward, this kind of courage only worry about it being "too much," not worry about it being "too little." Therefore, in matters of national importance, please, the courage of those in power, rather than "too much," is better "too little." Too little courage, at most, gives people a scolding of "holding a position and doing nothing." Too much courage inevitably leads to the bad name of "leaving a stink for ten thousand years."</p>
<p>If you want to say a truly accurate word, it should be like this: to do great things that benefit the country and the people, courage should be "too much"; to do deeds that harm the country and the people, courage should be "too little." This is the motto for officials.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Recording Notes <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Ruoqi</p>
<p>My old friend Wen Junyehe, since he left the journalist life of the press world in the 15th year of the Republic of China and entered the education world, the literary world in Shanghai has not seen his works for a long time. Except for a small number of new and old friends who have a good relationship with Jun, people are probably very few who know his whereabouts in recent years! In fact, in the past few years, he has been going south to Baiyue and north to Pingjin. In addition to teaching students with blackboards and chalk, he is still diligently studying. He is a scholar with a desire for knowledge like Mr. Liang Xinhui, so if there is something unknown in a certain area of ​​Chinese literature, there is nothing he will not exhaust the origins of in order to fully understand it before he is finished. He originally liked to study ancient literature such as phonology and tortoise shells. Recently, he has also studied local linguistics related to phonology. A few days ago, he suddenly wrote me a letter asking me to introduce him to recording. I thought my old friend didn't like music and opera, so why would he want to record at this moment? Later, I made an appointment and invited him to my residence, and then went together. In addition to Jun, there was also a Mr. Kong who came that day, who is said to be Jun's high achiever. (He is the author of the "What to do" collection) There was also a Mr. Yun. After a chat, I learned that the sound Jun wanted to record was many Siamese letters used in the Siamese language. This Mr. Yun is Siamese, and Junyehe will have to go to Beiping to teach soon, and the sounds of those Siamese letters are very difficult to remember, so he asked Mr. Yun to specially record the pronunciation of the letters on a record for his research materials in the future. Jun's rich research spirit can be seen from this, so I recorded it above.</p>
<h3 id="e184">From Waiting for Employment to "Oppression" <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— Liuxing</p>
<p>As long as we pay a little attention when stepping on the road, we can see many maids and elder sisters sitting densely in the "recommendation shops" waiting for employment. These are all people who have been exiled from the abandoned countryside. The labor they spend in the countryside cannot even support themselves, so they have to throw themselves into this big city and use their labor to exchange a bowl of rice to eat in wealthy people's homes.</p>
<p>We can imagine what kind of people wealthy people regard maids as. They have to get up earlier than their masters and have to sleep later than their masters. If they do something that the masters are not satisfied with, they will not only be arbitrarily scolded by the masters, but also lose their position of four or five yuan a month. This is still small about their own lives, but the hunger of their parents, in-laws, children, and even unemployed husbands really makes them unable to solve it in any way.</p>
<p>They are helpless people wandering in the metropolis. If they are young and beautiful, they will also be ravaged by the masters and bullied by the male servants. Don't think this is a common thing in the city. This is exactly the morbidity of society.</p>
<p>In the past year, the new films of the Star Company have mostly been picking on a certain morbidity of society and exposing and indicating it. Therefore, one of the above-mentioned social morbidities has also been captured on camera. That is "Oppression," which was first screened at the Central Grand Theater these days.</p>
<p>In "Oppression," we can not only see a tearful story, but its depiction of the destruction of the rural economy can also make people deeply feel the pain. What kind of efforts shall we make to revive our countryside and to relieve the hungry rural men and women in the upside-down situation!</p>
<h3 id="e185">I Also Talk About Qingdao's Bathing Beaches <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— Bamboo Shadow from Qingdao</p>
<p>Qingdao has four bathing beaches: ㈠ Huiquan, ㈡ West of the Zhanqiao Pier, ㈢ Zhan Mountain, ㈣ Chuanqu Port, etc., but none have the complete facilities of Huiquan.</p>
<p>If you are looking for a place close by, try bathing at the beach near your residence.</p>
<p>If you are looking for a crowded and lively place, a wide beach, clear water, fine sand, and calm tides, then go to Huiquan.</p>
<p>The Huiquan bathing beach has changing rooms, a swimming platform, a music pavilion, rescue boats, water police in yellow uniforms maintaining order, beautiful female bathers like flowers and jade, and waves of fragrant aromas... how orderly and sensual!</p>
<p>If you are not content in your heart and dislike loneliness, then bring a phonograph and a few bottles of soda. Lie on the soft, golden sand, flirt with your lover, turn on the phonograph to play sweet songs, drink your soda, listen to the clanging music, look at the clear blue sea, face your beautiful companion, and sit on the open beach. Wouldn't you feel as if you were in heaven on earth?</p>
<p>Qingdao, praised by everyone as a paradise, Qingdao, the world's park, Qingdao, without severe cold in winter and without extreme heat in summer, out-of-town tourists, why not come?</p>
<p>Under the green shade of trees, on Zhongshan Road, every afternoon, people ride bicycles, drive motorcycles, take rickshaws, or drive new-style small cars, with inflatable rings on their arms, all heading to Huiquan bathing beach for a swim.</p>
<p>The busiest time at the bathing beach is on Sundays and Saturday evenings. If you haven't been there, I guarantee you'll dare to go down. Misses, madams, young mistresses, hair ornaments sparkling, jade bodies lying horizontally, but just take off your clothes and go down. This is a public bathing beach, and no one will interfere, but you must wear a bathing suit.</p>
<p>If you are not good at swimming, be sure to bring an inflatable ring. The inflatable ring, floating in the water and held under your arm, can teach you to advance and retreat freely, and come and go as you please, otherwise you will be left sighing at the vastness of the sea.</p>
<p>Seawater is salty and can cure all kinds of skin diseases, so many tourists come from afar, climbing mountains and sailing seas to try bathing.</p>
<p>The bathing beach is open from July 15th to August 31st every year. The Jiaoji Railway sells discounted round-trip tickets for bathing guests.</p>
<p>Every August, a grand sea祭祀 ceremony is also held, with high platforms erected and fireworks set off, which is especially lively and grand.</p>
<p>When you come to bathe, you don't need to bring a tent, nor do you need to have your lover hold a parasol, because the purpose of sea bathing is to be晒 by the sunlight. Sunlight晒 is very beneficial to your body's health.</p>
<p>You don't need to bring a涼席 or blanket, because there is beautiful, fine sand here that won't soil your玉體 or clothes.</p>

<p>Chapter 13: Abandoning His Post to Meet His Soulmate, the Beautiful Woman Silently Approves</p>
<p>He Who Inherits the Family Gains a Healthy Son, a Wild Celebration</p>
<p>His thinking was indeed correct. That evening, as the mother and daughter were preparing dinner, Zhao's servant, Little Lin, called out in the courtyard: "Old Mrs. Yang, our master invites you over." Madam Jiang said, "Alright, I'll come after I finish making dinner." Little Lin said, "Our master is inviting you over for dinner. Don't make any." Madam Jiang had no choice but to agree to come right away. After Little Lin left for a while, he called out again outside the window, saying that the master was urging her to go immediately. Madam Jiang was in the middle of making noodles, preparing to eat noodle soup. She had no choice but to wash her hands and walk to the backyard. She saw Old Man Zhao rolling up the sleeves of his two leather robes, holding a broken蒲扇 in his hand, fanning the mouth of a copper火鍋子 placed on a square stool. Seeing Madam Jiang, he dropped the扇子 and repeatedly said, "Please sit." Madam Jiang saw his smiling face, and the wrinkles on his forehead and the corners of his eyes all appeared heavily stacked on top of each other. He was so happy to see her that he didn't know what to do, rubbing his hands together, calling out towards the door: "Little Lin, bring over the newly brewed pot of good hot tea for us to drink." Madam Jiang said, "Don't bother, you're too polite. I'm starting to feel拘謹." Old Man Zhao smiled and said, "Don't be拘謹. From now on, we're relatives. My family is small, and your family is small. We should visit each other and make things lively." The weather is still very凉, and I've prepared a火鍋子 of pickled cabbage and frozen tofu, as well as half a fried salty fish. Let's have a warm dinner and talk about whatever's on our minds slowly. I originally wanted to invite the eldest daughter as well, but then I thought that when it comes to a daughter's prospective in-laws' home, there's always some shyness. Inviting her to dinner would only make her suffer. So, I didn't invite her. Later, we'll send some dishes over for her to eat." Madam Jiang had nothing to say but to repeatedly say thank you. Little Lin came in, setting out cups and chopsticks on the table, placing the火鍋子, and then bringing over the fish盆 and wine壺 together. (162)</p>

<h3 id="e187">Simple Homemade Dyes <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— Bingyu</p>
<p>When chemical industries were not yet developed, purely primitive plant-based dyes were used, which involved boiling the flowers, fruits, peels, and roots of plants to extract various colors for dyeing. Now that chemical industries have advanced, almost all dyes are chemical-based, and the methods for using plant-based dyes are almost lost. However, plant-based dyes are actually more elegant and refined than chemical dyes, and they don't fade. Therefore, in recent years, there has been a revival of promoting primitive plant-based dyes. Now, I will briefly describe the colors that can be obtained from various plants and the dyeing methods.</p>
<p>Generally, when using plant materials such as the flowers, peels, roots, and fruits of草木 to dye fabrics, although the procedures are relatively complex, the elegance of the dyeing and its resistance to sunlight and washing are ultimately unmatched by chemical dyes. However, the colors dyed vary depending on the type of 草木. The most common examples include ㈠ madder roots, safflower flowers,蘇梗 stems, plum branches,丹皮, etc., whose juices extracted by boiling in water can be used to dye red. ㈡刈安草, Huangbo tree bark, gardenia fruit, turmeric root,柿子 seeds, etc., whose juices extracted by boiling in water can be used to dye yellow. ㈢ Hazelnut fruit peels, walnut fruit peels, chestnut fruit peels, bayberry tree bark,亚仙 and coffee seeds,矢車 fruits, black tea, etc., whose juices extracted by boiling in water can be used to dye茶色. ㈣ Blue tree bark,蓬 and pear tree bark, etc., can be used to dye青色. ㈤ Lithospermum roots, 五倍子, etc., can be used to dye purple. ㈥五倍子, chestnut flowers, mulberry wood, black beans, mountain cherry tree bark, etc., can be used to dye mouse gray. ㈦紺藍, lacquer tree leaves, oak tender leaves,矢車 fruits, can be used to dye black. However, these dyes should not be used alone and are often mixed with mordants for better color uptake.</p>
<p>The raw materials for mordants are alum, lye, lime, iron. 重克羅姆酸, aluminum (a soft, light white metal), chromium, tin, rice straw ash, etc. The dyeing method varies depending on what is being dyed. For example, when dyeing cloth and leather, it is necessary to first soak them in the mordant for a whole day and night, then take them out, rinse them clean with water, and soak them in an alkaline solution (i.e., a base dissolved in water) to prevent the mordant from falling off. Then, put them into the dye. If you want to print patterns, after soaking in the mordant, apply wax on top and then immerse it in the dye. In that case, the dye will be transformed into various colors due to the action of the fixed mordant. The most important thing to note here is that the mordant should be thoroughly浸透 and thoroughly washed clean after浸透. In this way, the dye will not run. After soaking in the dye for about ten minutes, dissolve soap in boiling water to melt away the wax, at which point the color will be fixed and will not change. If we want to distinguish the shades of the same color, we need to differentiate based on the type of mordant. If we use it cleverly, it will reveal very attractive colors. For example, alum produces the brightest color, while iron produces a deep, dark color. If we use a decoction of coffee beans to dye, we can first use alum as a mordant to turn it into a light tea color, then use lime as a mordant to turn it into a slightly darker茶色. If we then use a copper sulfate solution as a mordant, it will turn into a gray-tinted茶色. Finally, when iron is used as a mordant, it will turn into a black-tinted茶色, thus becoming the color of coffee. Therefore, according to the pattern, the wax left on the color gradually separates into shades of concentration within the same color due to the use of mordant procedures. Although this dyeing method is cumbersome, the colors dyed are more unique than those dyed with chemical dyes. As for the dyeing utensils, it is advisable to use pottery. When dyeing leather, tannin or chromium can be used, which will not fade even after prolonged exposure to sunlight. When using other rose flowers as a dye, Aniline black naphthalene solution can be used to soak white rose flowers with stems, which will turn gray or light black. The most suitable dye mixture is one-eighth of an ounce of dye mixed with three合 two勺 of water.</p>

<h3 id="e190">Causes and Cures for Weak Sound in AC Radios <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— One Who Knows</p>
<p>An AC radio, when bought or assembled, often has a loud and clear tone, which is very satisfactory. However, after using it for a period of time, the tone will gradually become weaker. The reasons for this are approximately as follows:</p>
<p>㈠ Due to the vacuum tube, after long-term use, the efficiency of electron emission is greatly reduced. The electron tube is the soul of the radio, like the brain in the human body. If the main brain loses its sensitive perception, the receiving efficiency will naturally be greatly reduced. When encountering this problem, you can only replace the electron tube with a new one or apply the resurrection method. Also, if the electron tube is used continuously for too long, it will generate high heat, and the emission of electrons inside the tube will exceed the specified range, and the receiving efficiency will also be reduced. When encountering this problem, you should quickly stop using the machine and restart it after the electron tube has cooled down.</p>
<p>㈡ Due to the transformer, if the high-power transformer is used continuously, both the copper wires and the iron sheets will generate high heat, thus increasing the resistance of the copper wires and the magnetic resistance of the iron sheets. If the eddy current loss (EDDY CURRENT LOSS) and the hysteresis loss (HYSTERESIS LOSS) on the iron sheet greatly increase, then the transformer will suffer a great invisible consumption, resulting in a great reduction in the output load power. If the radio has insufficient power, how can it have excellent reception?</p>
<p>㈢ Due to the capacitor, if the electrolytic filter or the capacitor with poor insulation is used for a long time, dust will accumulate, and in humid weather, it will easily cause part of the power to cross over, thus, the required voltage will lose a part, and the power will feel insufficient, and the sound will naturally be weakened.</p>
<p>㈣ Due to the resistor, carbon resistors cannot withstand high temperatures. If they are used for too long, the temperature will increase continuously, and the resistance will also continue to increase continuously. If the resistance is large, the current passing through will be small, and the electron tube will not get the appropriate current, and the receiving efficiency will be greatly reduced.</p>
<p>㈤ Due to the volume control, the volume control (VOLUMEGRAD) is made by coating carbon powder on an insulator to form a circle and adjusting it with a movable lever. Sometimes, after long-term use, the carbon powder decreases due to friction, the resistance increases, and the sound becomes weak.</p>
<p>㈥ Due to the wiring, improper wiring and loosening over time will reduce the contact area between the two conductors, increase the resistance, and the radio will also become weak.</p>
<p>In summary, the reasons for the weak sound of AC radios are due to: ㈠ continued use for too long, vacuum tubes, transformers, and resistors exceed their specified temperatures and lose their effectiveness; ㈡ dust accumulation and moisture intrusion cause leakage; ㈢ poor construction of the machine parts. Therefore, we should pay attention when using it: ㈠ Do not leave it on for too long. It is best to turn it off for two or three minutes after using it for one or two hours; ㈡ Do not place it in a humid place, and do not let dust get in. After a few months, blow away the accumulated dust inside; ㈢ Do not be greedy for temporary cheapness and buy inferior goods for each machine part, otherwise, you will lose more than you gain in the future. Pay attention to the wiring and use tin solder to fix it firmly, which can be done once and for all.</p>
<h3 id="e191">An Improved Regeneration Circuit <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Huayu</p>
<p>When we design a shortwave machine, the most difficult thing is that the oscillation caused by ordinary regeneration coils cannot be very stable. We now discard the regeneration coil and use the circuit in the attached figure. Then we can get good results. This circuit only uses one plug-in coil L, so changing the wavelength is very convenient, and it can be applied from tens of meters to the broadcast wavelength band. In the figure, the grid and screen of the tube are coupled using the primary of the headphones or the low-frequency transformer. Therefore, the regenerative force is not generated by the ordinary regeneration coil or variable capacitor, but by the resistance. In addition, the antenna is coupled by a capacitor as in the ordinary method, but C2 has two functions: one, the regenerative force can occur within a very wide adjustment range, and two, the adjustment circuit only has self-inductance. In short, the advantage of this circuit is that it can receive various wavelengths with only a coil change.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Adjustment and Steps of a Shortwave Transmitter (Continued) <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Jingyu</p>
<p>The above chapter on the principle and steps of single-oscillation adjustment</p>
<p>The Chinese translation of single-oscillation is also called self-made type, including three main circuits: Hartley, TPTG (TUNED PLATE GRID), and Colpitts. According to the method of matching, it is divided into two categories: inductive coupling (LNDUCTIVE COUPLING) and capacitive coupling (CAPACITVE COUPLING). However, although the method of matching has such categories, the purpose is the same, which is to return the plate current to the grid and ask him to oscillate.</p>
<p>If the steps for single-oscillation adjustment are described in detail, there will naturally be many, but the general division can be divided into the following five stages:</p>
<p>㈠ If we have constructed all the equipment according to a certain established circuit (the three main circuits will be discussed in detail in paragraph (3)), then the first point we need to check is whether the positions of the various installations are appropriate, the second point is whether the various wirings are firm and reliable, and the third point is whether the coil used matches the wavelength we expected. Secondly,</p>
<p>㈡ Light the filament to the rated voltage. If it is in a colder season, it is best to let the filament burn alone for a minute or two to make its heat sufficient, and then add the plate voltage. (This situation is especially emphasized in old-fashioned鐺製 vacuum tubes: because this type of vacuum tube will not have electrons flying out of the filament unless it reaches the highest heat.) The filament voltage can sometimes be slightly changed during the adjustment process: but if it is too high, the vacuum tube will be easily damaged, and if it is too low, it will not easily oscillate. As for the plate voltage, it can usually be half of the rated value during adjustment, or even as high as two-thirds weak. For example, we mostly use 50-watt vacuum tubes up to 500 or 600 volts. A 250-watt vacuum tube can be used up to 1,000 or 1,200 volts. Then</p>
<p>㈢ Re-tune the oscillation circuit. The method is to first remove the antenna, or make the antenna coil very loosely coupled, and then start the tuning work of the oscillation circuit. Also, because there are differences between inductive coupling and capacitive coupling, the procedures for tuning the oscillation circuit are also different. I will now describe them separately below. However, before starting the description, we have to understand that the quality of the tuning oscillation also determines the efficiency of the machine itself. As mentioned earlier, a good oscillation situation is to minimize the plate current: therefore, when we change the number of turns of the coil up and down (such as Hartley) or move the number of degrees of the capacitor (such as Colpitts, etc.), when we stop at a certain point, the positions on both sides are based on increasing the number of plate currents: then the certain point where the machine stops is the standard point for the best oscillation situation. Of course, this situation can also be said to indicate the highest point of the machine's own efficiency. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e193">How to Adjust the Lowest Bass (Continued) <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Guan Zhibing</p>
<p>What I'm talking about is the tone problem, so let's talk about the tones of these two radio stations: when listening to XCBL, its lowest bass only reaches 蓬!蓬!蓬! and stops there; and it also seems to lack a bit of echo, but when listening to ZMHY, below 蓬!蓬!蓬! you can still hear the tone of 洪!洪!洪!, and below this tone of 洪!洪!洪! there is an unlimited spare volume, as if standing on a high mountain and looking down at a deep abyss, wanting it to be high, it goes straight up to the blue sky, wanting it to be low, it sinks into the unfathomable abyss.</p>
<p>Now let's get back to the topic and talk about how the lowest bass is cut off. How can the lowest bass be adjusted? As mentioned in the previous section, the quality of the tone depends entirely on the low-frequency amplifier, which is beyond doubt. However, even with the same machine, slightly changing its adjustment can cut off or obtain the possibility of the lowest bass. It seems that more attention needs to be paid to the adjustment. According to the author's speculation, generally, those who make adjustments often feel that the tone is not loud enough, so they focus on the last two stages of low-frequency amplification or perhaps add two stages of amplification. If they feel that it is too loud, the control is mostly in the last two stages, or the controller at the pickup stage is used to control it. In this way, the high-frequency part is amplified and the low-frequency part is cut off without being aware of it.</p>
<p>Experience tells me that if you want to adjust the lowest bass, you must</p>
<p>Amplify the first two stages of the low-frequency amplifier as much as possible, paying special attention to the pickup stage, so that the original sound is emitted as faithfully as possible, but it should not be amplified too much to cause distortion, or it will cut off the highest treble.</p>
<p>I have now drawn the circuit diagram of my machine above. When A is amplified as much as possible and B is reduced, the lowest bass can be obtained, but on the contrary, if B is amplified and A is reduced, the lowest bass will be cut off and unheard. Therefore, I think that the low-frequency amplifier must amplify the first two stages as much as possible and not increase the consumption resistance, resulting in the cutting off of its lowest bass.</p>
<p>I wrote the above text specifically for the reference of fellow radio researchers, and I hope that you will supplement or correct it after the experiment, that would be even better. (End)</p>

<p>— Ke Ming</p>
<p>A new type of "LITTLEFUSES" has recently come onto the American market that can be used in various radio circuits. Its current carrying capacity ranges from ten milliamperes to two amperes, with different low and high voltages.</p>
<p>Low-voltage small fuses are shaped like glass tube-style grid leak resistors and are ideal for protecting various AC and DC milliampere meters, low-voltage ammeters, voltmeters, etc. The installation methods include using grid leak resistor brackets or using clips that can be connected to flexible wires, as well as the plug-in method used for lightning protection devices, which requires adding corresponding insertion materials.</p>
<p>High-voltage fuses have several types such as one thousand, five thousand, and ten thousand volts, with lengths ranging from three inches to ten inches to suit various high-voltage fusing amounts. The fuse holder is made of porcelain or a clip with a base with considerable insulation. This high-voltage fuse is used to protect the rectifier tube and the transmitting tube from overload.</p>

<p>— Li Yuandu</p>
<p>Although there are many methods for measuring capacitance, they are all very troublesome. Here are two simple methods for readers to choose from.</p>
<p>㈠ As shown in the first figure, V is an O|IOOV AC voltmeter, and the input voltage is 220 volts. First figure</p>
<p>The input voltage is two hundred and twenty volts. First, various capacitors of known capacitance are connected to XX in turn, and the different voltage values are measured and drawn into a table. (As shown in the second figure) Later, if you want to measure a capacitor of unknown capacitance, you can connect it to XX in the same way, first look at the value of the voltmeter, and then refer to the chart. You can get the value of the capacitance.</p>
<p>Second figure</p>
<p>Capacitance (MFD)</p>
<p>Voltmeter value (VOLLS) ㈡ In the third figure, the input AC voltage is 220 volts, 60 cycles, MA is an AC milliampere meter, and C is the capacitor to be measured. Its capacitance can be calculated according to the following simple formula:</p>

<p>(13) Tuning Circuit</p>
<p>(1) The Meaning of Tuning: To understand the function of a tuning circuit, one must first understand what tuning is and its unique characteristics. Here is a diagram to illustrate its meaning: Figure 1 shows a circuit composed of a capacitor C, an inductor L, and a resistor R. If an alternating current (AC) power source is connected to this circuit, current will circulate back and forth within it. If the frequency of the AC power source is varied one by one until it reaches an appropriate frequency, the current flowing through the circuit will be at its maximum. This phenomenon is called tuning, and the frequency possessed by the power source at this time is called the tuning frequency. If the frequency of the power source remains constant, and the capacitance C or inductance L in the circuit is increased or decreased, the point where the current is at its maximum can also be adjusted. This phenomenon also belongs to tuning.</p>
<p>(2) Relationship between Tuning Frequency and CL: Let F be the tuning frequency, with its unit in kilocycles (KC); C be the capacitance, with its unit in microfarads (MF); L be the inductance, with its unit in microhenries (MH); when there is the following relationship between F and CL, the tuning phenomenon occurs.</p>
<p>And its tuning wavelength (in meters) is:</p>
<p>(3) Tuning Circuit of a Radio: The tuning circuit of a radio is composed of a capacitor and an inductor, and it is the main gateway of the radio. All incoming radio waves must pass through this gateway. By varying the capacitance of the capacitor one by one, one can select the incoming wavelengths to be received. The range of the tuning wavelength is determined by the combination of capacitance and inductance. Currently, the wavelength range used for broadcasting is from 200 meters to 545 meters. Therefore, to suit this wavelength range, the number of plates of the variable capacitor and the number of turns of the inductor should be appropriately selected. The method of selection will be described in detail in another article.</p>
<p>I | Milliamperes</p>
<p>F | Frequency</p>
<p>E Voltage (Volts)</p>
<p>For example, in Figure 3, if the measured current is 83 milliamperes, according to the above formula, the capacitance is: (approximate value)</p>
<p>The capacitance measured by the above two methods is about 5% up or down. (For example, a 1 MFD capacitor measures a value of 1.05 MFD, the difference is very small, and it does not hinder practical use.)</p>
<p>Before measuring a capacitor, you must first try to verify that the capacitor is not damaged or short-circuited. Otherwise, there is a risk of burning out the meter and fuse. This point should be especially noted.</p>

<h3 id="e197">Method for Cutting Gramophone Records <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Jingyong</p>
<p>Using discarded gramophone records to make the front and back panels of smaller radios is no different in function from bakelite boards. However, sawing them into the appropriate size to meet the needs is more difficult than sawing bakelite boards because they are thin and brittle and easily broken if not handled carefully. Therefore, those who want to use them often encounter difficulties. I will now record the two cutting methods I use. If you follow these methods, you will surely be satisfied.</p>
<p>Place the gramophone record and use a soapstone pencil and a metal ruler to draw the desired size. Then, use a small paper cutter to draw a groove along the drawn line, with a depth of about half the thickness of the record. Then align the groove with the edge of the table and lightly press down with your hand, and it will break easily.</p>
<p>The method of drawing the size is the same as before. Then place the record on a flat board, prepare a wooden strip, and place a flat-edged kitchen knife on the stove fire. When the knife is slightly red, press the wooden strip on the soapstone pencil line drawn on the record surface and cut it flat with the knife, just like cutting a cake, without any effort. However, the former method is superior to the latter because the edge of the record is smoother.</p>

<h3 id="e198">On Treating Headaches by Curing Feet <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Qifan</p>
<p>There are many principles that are indeed difficult to understand. The more profound the principle, the more difficult it is to understand. China is the oldest country in the world, and there are especially many profound principles of this kind. Since the business of Western medicine has become increasingly prosperous, and the livelihood of traditional Chinese medicine has become increasingly pressured, the dispute between the new and old medical circles has arisen, a competition for survival. Thus, the name "national medicine" was born. National medicine is of the same nature as national studies. To say that it cannot exist is to say that it does not exist. To argue that it can exist, there are many profound reasons, and it can indeed make people deeply believe in its existence.</p>
<p>Some national doctors also like to use Western medicine, using 606 to treat syphilis, quinine to treat malaria, aspirin for superficial relief, and baking soda for clearing the stomach, etc. But in words, they still maintain their true color as national doctors, talking eloquently about the five elements of mutual generation and overcoming, the roles of monarch, minister, assistant, and guide. That is to say, Chinese learning is the essence, and Western learning is for practical use. What the result is has already been recorded in history.</p>
<p>Later, national doctors realized that their own theories were too profound and difficult for people to understand. So they abandoned their own theories and rose up to attack the lack of depth in Western medical theories. They said that Western doctors only know how to treat headaches by treating the head and foot pain by treating the foot, and there is no fundamental and thorough solution. It must be known that life is a whole, with everything related. The onset of disease has its fundamental cause. By treating the root, it can be cured. This great principle is impeccable and wins the belief of many people. Thus, national medicine is revived, and the call to revive national medicine is raised again.</p>
<p>Some people understand that treating headaches by treating the head and foot pain by treating the foot is not in accordance with medical ethics. So they suddenly realize and say: A headache must be treated by curing the feet. They then follow this method to practice medicine and do things, and implement this principle in all facilities and arrangements. For a time, people's hearts are aroused, and there is a lot of noise. But what the result is, has not yet been seen, because it is still forming historical facts.</p>
<h3 id="e199">More on the Ode to the Ugly Woman <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Zizhan</p>
<p>Yesterday, I saw an article submitted to Free Talk by someone with the pen name Yuping. It pointed out that there were slight differences in the wording between the Ode to the Ugly Woman by Liu Sizhen of the Xian Tang Wen edited by Yan Ji, which I quoted, and the one recorded in the Chuxue Ji by Xu Jian. He spared no effort to meticulously proofread it, just like Mr. Hu Linchen's proofreading of my article On Fart Literature. This is even more admirable. However, textual research is difficult, and proofreading is also not easy. Mr. Yuping proofread the Ode to the Ugly Woman only based on the Chuxue Ji, without consulting the Xian Tang Wen edited by Yan Ji, and other Tang and Song encyclopedias such as the Yiwen Leiju and the Taiping Yulan, to compare them one by one. His erudition is still not perfect, so is there any regret? Moreover, after this ode has been proofread and corrected, Mr. Yuping said that all the difficult-to-understand words can be understood, but only the sentence "Zhe e nie lou bi" is still not easy to understand, and he is still afraid that the word "nie" is wrong. From the perspective of someone as ignorant as myself, in what is called understandable, there are still some that I dare not pretend to understand. In what is called not easy to understand, there is also more than one sentence, or at least one word is wrong. Han scholars explained the words "Yue ruo ji gu" in the Shangshu, and they could extend to 100,000 words. Mr. Yuping already has a proofreading addiction or a textual research addiction, why not expand the legacy of Han scholars and annotate this ode with hundreds of thousands of words, so that everyone can understand it? As for Yuping's saying that in the Chuxue Ji, under the Ode to the Ugly Woman, the words "Ci fan bu ju zai" were not noted, as in other articles, and therefore he suspected that it was not a complete piece, it is probably not necessarily so. In fact, Tang and Song encyclopedias often cut, excerpt, revise, and alter, and they never noted them one by one. For example, in the sentence "Zhe e yan lou bi, liang yan xi ru jiu" in the Ode to the Ugly Woman, the Yiwen Leiju writes "Zhe e yan hei mian, lou bi liang yan," which is the original and which is the revised version, who can know? Thank you, Yuping, for your reckless talk. Double the manuscript fee, please eat wine. If wine cannot be eaten, is it necessary for a proofreading expert to change eating to drinking? I have been accumulating boredom for days, and I am laughing about this. Can Mr. Yuping understand my heart?</p>
<h3 id="e200">Pulling <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Muqi</p>
<p>Free Talk has successively pointed out the two phenomena of "pushing" and "kicking". Whether it is pushing or kicking, although the two have different uses depending on the situation and object, the essence and function are still the same.</p>
<p>From pushing and kicking, one can also think of another phenomenon that occurs correspondingly, but the phenomenon itself is the opposite of pushing and kicking, and that is "pulling". This exists not only in our imagination, but also in ordinary facts. For a door or window, there are usually two phenomena of "pushing" and "pulling". If you don't want to use your hand, you can also kick it open with your foot or hook it up. Naturally, crude doors and windows can be kicked or hooked, while luxurious doors and windows can only be pushed or pulled.</p>
<p>It is not enough to have only pushing or kicking. If a door or window is pushed but not pulled, it cannot be pushed again. Although new-style doors and windows can close automatically after being pushed open, this is obviously a reaction to pushing that is similar to pulling. In order to avoid the vibration of this reaction, it is best to pull it in and stop its momentum. To continue pushing, you need to pull it in on one hand. Only by pulling it in can the function of pushing be revealed. The same is true for kicking. Pushing and kicking are opposite and complementary to pulling.</p>
<p>When the Manchus entered China and became the masters, they pulled in the Han literati in order to stabilize their newly acquired privileges of pushing and kicking. Pulling cannot be done unilaterally, and the Han literati naturally also gladly pulled in the newly victorious Manchus in order to maintain their inherent position of pushing and kicking. Who pulled first? That cannot be known. In short, anyone who holds the power to push and kick has the qualification, the possibility, and the necessity to pull.</p>
<p>Ordinary people are not qualified to pull. On the contrary, they have the "share" to be pushed and kicked. This is because "punishment does not extend to officials, and rites do not extend to commoners". If ordinary people could also pull, that would be the "conscription" during military times. Those who are pushed and kicked taste the taste of pulling because of the mutual pushing and kicking of those who push and kick.</p>
<p>During the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom revolution, the Manchus pulled in the Han literati, and the Han literati pulled in Ward and Gordon Baizhiwen, staging a "three-pull reunion". As a result, the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom was kicked down.</p>
<p>Now this comedy is appearing again in the northeast corner. On one end is Japan, which is said to be of the same race and culture, and on the other end are the Manchus and Hans, who have already achieved five races united as one republic. This is the most blatant example.</p>
<p>From the point of view of pulling, the times are reversing, and history is repeating itself.</p>
<h3 id="e201">From "Outside the Great Compassion Temple" to the So-Called Educational Novel <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Shiheng</p>
<p>In the August 10th "Free Talk", Mr. Fengwu wrote an article discussing educational novels based on Mr. Lao She's recent work. The term "educational novel" is not only unclear to Mr. Fengwu, but also to many people, because all novels, whether consciously or unconsciously, are doing the work of education. If we say that only novels that depict matters relating to education are educational novels, then the definition is too narrow. But if we say that all novels with a strong educational consciousness can become educational novels, then the definition is too broad. No matter what Mr. Fengwu thinks of this definition, his reasoning using "Outside the Great Compassion Temple" to discuss educational novels is wrong.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, "Outside the Great Compassion Temple" (originally published in "Literary Monthly", Volume 4, Issue 1) cannot be called an educational novel. Although the material is taken from the relationship between teachers and students in school life, the author's main purpose is to describe two typical people, the first half being that Huang academic supervisor, and the second half being that Ding Geng who beat the academic supervisor to death. Both of them are particularly typical people and cannot represent all academic supervisors and all students. Therefore, the relationship between them is also extremely special. If the author did not write Mr. Huang as an academic supervisor and Ding Geng as a student, the characters and stories could still develop in the same way, because the author did not intend to make them choose these two people and the possibility of this story only exists in school life. Huang academic supervisor is depicted as a personification of "kindness", and Ding Geng is his opposite. Undoubtedly, Mr. Lao She has some aversion to this latter type of person, but in order to make him also reveal a deeper human nature, he applied the old literary trick of conscience condemnation. This kind of writing of course unconsciously exposes the tricks played by the so-called petty bourgeoisie or intellectuals in literature, but the author certainly did not want to use this trick to solve the problem. Even taking a step back, it cannot be said to reflect reality, and is a fabrication of exaggerated facts in order to intentionally make the characters more profound.</p>
<p>Therefore, Mr. Fengwu said, "But is this kind of idealistic self-blame enough to solve the problem? Not at all. Therefore, Ding Geng has no way to save himself, and in education, there is no case where self-condemnation solves disputes." This passage makes people feel that it is somewhat irrelevant.</p>
<p>The author is contradictory in describing the character of Ding Geng. How did he describe Ding Geng at first?｜Look: "At that time, Ding Geng was only seventeen years old. He always wore a small blue cloth shirt, with small red pimples on his face, and his eyes were always a little watery, as if he had applied some eye medicine. He was honest, didn't like to talk, sometimes he was good with you, sometimes he was good with you, sometimes he automatically cleaned up the dormitory, sometimes he didn't wash his face for a day. So he was a young lady｜a little unpredictable." Although this simple and vivid article depicts the character of this young lady vividly, it is inevitably very difficult to transform him into a profound character who is permanently suffering from conscience condemnation. The author only uses a few "never care": "I give in, I never care: "I die, I never care about you": If you want to kill me, please do, I never care", these kinds of words are not enough to be the reason for the transformation of Ding Geng before and after. This kind of contradiction in character is really the shortcoming of this work.</p>
<p>As Mr. Fengwu said, "Only a serious attitude, without a correct creative method, will not receive a powerful effect." However, the so-called "correct creative method" here should not be led to whether conscience condemnation can solve the problem. The "correct creative method" and whether it can actually solve the problem are unrelated.</p>
<p>Therefore, Mr. Fengwu first regarded "Outside the Great Compassion Temple" as an "educational novel" and discussed it, which was already wrong. Secondly, he regarded the conscience condemnation expressed in it as a method of education, which led to the question of whether this doctrine can solve the problem of education, which is even more wrong. Originally, Mr. Fengwu's short article did not need to be pointed out like this, but thinking that the problem committed by this article is exactly the same as the mistake caused by the currently popular idealistic literary theory, and that this method of literary theory is really extremely harmful, I could not help but speak out.</p>
<h3 id="e202">Life and Machine (2) <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Yang</p>
<p>Those two skinny black legs became even more tense, and the little bit of muscle left under the dirty skin was full of blood; step up, and then stand on it. Ah, only two steps left, the skinny body suddenly began to sway, like a reed in the wind. The teeth were clenched, and the lonely legs were lifted up again, desperately stepping on the second step. Suddenly, in his chest, a sour and numb thing stirred, rushing upward desperately, rushing into his throat, rushing into his mouth; the eyes turned into a dark mass, the steps, the lights, and his own feet were all gone, only countless small golden dots were flying in the darkness. It sounded like millions of mosquitoes were flying in his ears, buzzing like thunder. His feet suddenly softened, and he fell to the floor of the hold, along with his package, from the side of the unrailed stairs.</p>
<p>"What's wrong? Old Zhang!" A man in old blue cloth pants exclaimed, stopped his feet, and looked down.</p>
<p>"You pig! Haven't you gone back to your hometown yet! Why aren't you moving?" The cursing voice and the whip like a poisonous snake rang again in the noisy and chaotic air.</p>
<p>The man in old blue cloth pants continued to climb up, and the dropped gear teeth were replenished and completed again. A child who had not yet developed, naked, with a piece of greasy and sweaty cloth draped over his shoulders, ran quickly from the iron plate to the stairs, bent down and looked carefully: the old man was lying quietly on his back on the ground, his hands spread out, his legs bent, half of the big package was on his chest, and half was on the ground. In the deep ditch of his chest, fresh blood was flowing lazily. His mouth was slightly open, and a wisp of blood was still hanging on the corner of his mouth. His eyes were open, like a yellow croaker three days out of the water, never blinking.</p>
<p>"How is it? Little Fang." The man in old blue cloth pants walked down the stairs and asked in a low voice. "It's over!" The child wiped the sweat and tears from his forehead with a black cloth, and squeezed out two words from the bottom of his broken heart.</p>
<p>The poisonous curses and the sound of the whip brushing through the air gradually approached them, so the two looked at each other, bit their teeth, and went back to work.</p>
<p>"Snap! Snap!" The whip fell mercilessly on the blood-stained chest, "Hey! Stop pretending to be dead!" There was no expression on the dry face, and even the eyebrows did not move. The big eyes like dried and salted fish turned upward, as if seeing a purpose beyond life. The dry and shriveled mouth was open, and no one's voice would ever come out of it.</p>
<p>A shadow swept across the yellow face on the Xiangyun yarn shirt, and fierce light shot out of the bloodshot eyes; suddenly, that face smiled, and the laughter trembled in the air, like an owl in the deep night, but the greater mixed sound seemed to be buried in this ear-piercing laughter. A hand moved lightly, and the whip drew a big circle in the air, sounding like the string behind a kite in March.</p>
<p>"Black Dog, Little Huang! Roll him up in a reed mat and throw him into the river." The bloodless lips smiled cruelly, and a shadow of sin flashed on the snow-white teeth.</p>
<p>Second</p>
<p>The night wind on the river brought coolness and moisture in gusts, and the pier was immersed in the shadows of the dim electric lights; below, the river was surging, and the waves were flashing with dim light. The large ship was already fully loaded with joy, sorrow, sin, and cargo when it set anchor at dusk.</p>
<p>On the dirty floor of the pier, many tired people were lying like dried salted fish. Under their backs, some used ash-black broken mats, some used broken pieces of cloth, some picked up relatively complete newspapers from the garbage pile and laid them on the ground, and some lay on the rough floor with their backs bare. Everyone's muscles were soft and limp, and their necks were as sore as if they had been hit by a hammer. Those lying on their backs did not have the strength to lie on their sides; those lying on their sides did not want to go to the trouble of turning over. Whatever they were like, they would always be like that, but in this pile of smelly salted fish, there was still a remnant of biological touch, emotion, and fantasy.</p>

<p>Drastic Drop in Gold Market</p>
<p>Guangdong Merchants Sold Heavily Off-Exchange, Opening 27.8 Yuan Lower</p>
<p>Frequent Proposals Led to a Dire Fall of 38.8 Yuan</p>
<p>Gold Exchange Announces Normal Business Hours After September 1st</p>
<p>Gold</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market continued its sharp decline after the previous day’s turbulent shift. Initial overseas telegrams reported slight gains in the Bank of England and increases in American banks. Exchange rates saw a rise of 3.5 cents in British currency and an even greater increase of 8.75 cents in American currency. At the Five Metals Exchange, silver futures unexpectedly rose by varying amounts, from 1.1 to 1.22 cents. Stocks surged by more than four yuan, and American wheat rose by 2.75 cents, while American cotton increased by 66 pounds per unit. Amidst the prevailing panic, the opening price for raw gold was set at 55-56 yuan, with Guangdong merchants aggressively selling, gradually pushing the price down to 45-46 yuan. After the opening, the price managed to rise briefly, driven by strong bank demand, reaching just over 51 yuan. However, it struggled to maintain this level and subsequently declined again, albeit calmly. News from Reuters that US inflation proposals included suggestions from Senators Smith and Jones to issue interest-free bonds to raise prices, and that the President was paying close attention, triggered a catastrophic fall to below 40 yuan. Further pressure came from suggestions by the Secretary of Commerce, Mr. Wheeler, leading to further declines. Later, the market rebounded slightly due to strong bank demand, but many took the opportunity to sell high, pushing the price back below 40 yuan. Further Reuters reports on statements and proposals from US Senator Thomas (an inflation advisor) made it difficult for the market to recover. The day’s market conditions were extremely bleak, with a near 40-yuan drop compared to the previous close. Although there was heavy selling, large investors also aggressively covered short positions. The additional cost was 195 yuan, and the forward premium was 6.5 yuan. The day’s market conditions are recorded below.</p>
<p>The</p>
<p>opening price was 845.5 yuan, a sharp drop of 27.8 cents compared to the previous close. Spot goods opened at 4.5 yuan. The foreign exchange market opened with recent sales prices of one shilling and three pence for British currency and 28 yuan for American currency. Initially, there was great confusion, but then Qian Changxiang, the Dalian group, Heng Yu, Yuan Feng, Yong Da, and Xing Yong began buying. Banque Belge increased its bid to 625 for November US dollars, and McCallie raised its bid to 4375 for October, pushing the price gradually from 5 yuan to 50 yuan. Banque Belge offered 5625 for November US dollars, while Yuan Mao and Yong Shen Kang sold again, causing the price to drop back to 46 yuan. Qing Fa, Yong Da, Xing Yong, and Heng Tai aggressively bought, and banks took 625 for November US dollars, driving the price up to 60 yuan. Upon learning that HSBC had raised its listing price by 25 cents for shillings and 1.125 yuan for US dollars, sellers rushed in, and the price dropped to 46.5 yuan. Later, Zhao Feng Chang, Heng Yu, Qing Fa, and Yong all entered the market, pulling the price up. Banks showed strong demand, with Credit, Banque Belge, and McCallie all increasing their bids to 5625 for November US dollars. Yuan Mao, Yong Heng Yu, Shunli, and others actively bought, pushing the price up to 51.4 yuan. Pan Gen offered half a yuan for November as well. Heng Yu, Rui Kang, Heng Tai Xing jointly sold, gradually pushing the price down, but things remained calm. Citibank was still taking 5652 for November, making it difficult to sell. Zheng Chang sold spot goods for 46 yuan, and Shanghai accepted 625 for November US dollars, pulling the price up by over three yuan. Amidst this struggle, Reuters again reported news of serious US inflation measures. Heng Yu sold aggressively, and Heng Xing, Yuan Fu, Tai Heng, Zhi Feng, Yong Yuan Mao, Yong Heng Xing, Shen Kang, Da Xing, Yong Shunli all sold, causing the decline to intensify. The price fell to 35.5 yuan, and banks such as HSBC and Banque Belge all bid 8125 and 875 for November US dollars. Da Xing Yong bought at 80 cents. Unfavorable news came from overseas, and Qian Changxiang, Da De Cheng, Heng Xing, Da Fa Yong, and others entered the market to sell, pushing the price down to 33 yuan. Bank companies offered 875 for November US dollars as well. McCallie then took 9375 for the same month. The afternoon closing price was 835 yuan. After the market closed, Ri Chang, Yuan Mao, Yong Heng Yu, Zhao Feng Chang all bought, pushing the price up to 8 yuan. Spot goods were sold for 7 yuan.</p>
<p>In the</p>
<p>after-market, Da De Cheng and Heng Yu actively bought, with Mei Feng taking 9375 to 8125 for November US dollars. The opening price rose to 842 yuan, and spot goods opened at 1.8 yuan. Da Xing Yong bought aggressively, and Bing Xing, Zhi Feng, Yong Heng Yu, Yuan Sheng Yong also bought, gradually pushing the price up to 3.8 yuan, as Banque Belge bid 625 for October and 8125 for November US dollars. Yuan Mao, Yong Shen Kang continued to sell, and Zhao Feng Chang also sold, pushing the price down to 20 cents. Heng Yu took advantage of the low price to buy at just over 2 yuan, and Banque Belge offered 9375 for December US dollars. Heng Yu bought and then sold again, resulting in a downstream trend. Yuan Xing Yong, Da Xing Yong, Yuan Heng, Zhao Feng Chang, Heng Yu Heng Xing, and others jointly sold. HSBC took 875 for November US dollars, but found it difficult to sell, and the price fell to 35 yuan. Banque Belge took 9375 for November US dollars, and Yi Feng Yong and others bought, leading to repeated rebounds. However, Yuan Mao Yong and others provided strong supply, and the closing price still retreated from 7.5 yuan to 834.5 yuan. Spot goods were sold for 5 yuan. The highest price of the day was 851.4 yuan, and the lowest price was 833 yuan, with a fluctuation of 18.4 yuan. As a result, the closing price was 38.8 yuan lower than the previous close.</p>
<p>The</p>
<p>quoted price was 1.125 yuan higher for HSBC’s US dollar listing, totaling 27.875 yuan, resulting in a gold standard price of 861 yuan. Based on the closing price, it was approximately 26 yuan higher, more than two yuan stronger than the previous close. The current month’s premium was 846 yuan, September’s was 841 yuan, and October’s was 835 yuan. The morning margin call was 846 yuan, and the afternoon margin call was the same price. The additional cost was 195 yuan. The initial intraday trading price was an additional 193 yuan, taken by Tai Kang Run, with approximately 500 taels traded. Later, due to the decline in futures prices, the additional cost was increased to 200 yuan, taken by Ying Feng Heng, with approximately 200 taels traded. The after-market price was an additional 205 yuan, and there was demand, all supplied by the Tianjin group. The September/October spread was offered at 35 strips by Chang Sheng Yong and 14 strips by Yuan Mao Yong, while Shunli took 49 strips at 6.5 yuan. There were 763 strips remaining for the current month and 2,597 strips remaining for September.</p>

<p>A Completely Calm Atmosphere</p>
<p>Prices Show Mixed Gains and Losses</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange saw an increasingly quiet market. The clearance of transactions was unprecedented, and the stagnation of prices made people hesitate. Large investors were mostly watching, and retail trading was also sparse. The reason for the mutual holding of bulls and bears was that the bulls knew that they would no longer replenish their positions due to the large-scale selling of No. 46 in recent days, so they held on even more. However, as the settlement date gradually approached, it was feared that they would not be able to hold on for long. The morning market opened with clear transactions and weak prices, generally down about 5 fen to 2 jiao. Large investors showed no buying or selling trends and were extremely idle and stagnant. The closing transactions were even clearer, and prices fluctuated, showing inconsistency. The overall tax was relatively strong, and changes were expected within the next week. The resulting prices showed mixed gains and losses. The near-term 20-Guan and gold short bonds rose by 5 fen or 3 jiao, the 19 Post-War and salt tax far-term bonds rose by 5 fen or 1 jiao, while the rest fell by 5 fen to 2 jiao. The total trading volume was only 2.92 million yuan, and there was no spot trading at all. Futures trading totaled 1.315 million for the unified salt tax, only 300,500 for troop reduction, 325,000 for 19 Guan Post-War, 135,000 for 20 Volume 20 Guan, and the rest ranged from 20,000 to 100,000.</p>
<p>New York Stocks Rise Slightly</p>
<p>Xin Feng Yang Bank reported that on Thursday (17th), New York stock prices rose due to the fall in the US exchange rate and the firm commodity prices. Each stock rose by 1 yuan to 7 yuan, with a total of 2.47 million shares traded throughout the day. Wheat rose sharply due to news that someone had organized a bull company, and buying sentiment was strong. In terms of news and situation, it is expected to continue to rise. American cotton was affected by the US exchange rate and grains, rising by more than 60 pounds, and southern hedging was easily absorbed. Silver prices also rose with commodities, and there was significant demand at the close. The Dow Jones index is listed on the left. Closing prices compared to the previous day:</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks: 99.30, up 4.86</p>
<p>20 Railroad Stocks: 49.08, up 2.19</p>
<p>20 Utility Stocks: 30.92, up 1.35</p>
<p>40 Bond Stocks: 87.99, up 0.02</p>
<p>Yarn and Cotton</p>
<h3 id="e207">Active Forward Yarn Factory Sales <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market rose in the morning and fell in the afternoon. Although American cotton rose, the exchange rate rose sharply, and the domestic economy declined. Yarn sales were sluggish, and purchasing power was weak in all areas. Faced with a bleak future, factories tried their best to sell forward yarn and compete with inferior yarn. Wuxi yarn factories also sold out in the yarn bidding market. The long positions for this month gradually closed, and the 80 yuan mark was feared to be difficult to maintain.</p>
<p>Human Label After-Market Turns Down</p>
<p>The human label market opened higher in the morning, following the rise in foreign cotton. Retail investors covered their positions, but speculators aggressively sold, and the second and third rounds of bidding saw declines again. As a result, each month rose by 4, 5, 7, and 9 jiao. In the afternoon, inland factories sold out, and although foreign cotton rose, actual sales were sluggish, and it was difficult to reduce yarn inventories. A sudden drop of 8 jiao to 1.2456 yuan occurred. The total trading volume for the day was 48,300 bales. Of these, Chun Ji sold 1,300 bales, Mingde 1,000 bales, Shen Chang 1,150 bales, Shen Ji 1,600 bales, Ren Feng 3,800 bales, and Tong He 2,000 bales. Tong Fu bought 4,300 bales, Yu Kang 1,900 bales, Da Feng 2,000 bales, Rong Xing 2,000 bales, Xie Sheng 1,350 bales, and Yuan Tai 1,550 bales. Closing prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Human Label Closing Prices, Gains/Losses, and Inventory: November 1870, down 654,350; August 1811, down 428,800; December 1877, 940,000; September 1847, 755,300; January 1888, 740,500; October 1861, 568,200. Total: 287,150. Few Spot Yarn Sales.</p>
<p>Spot yarn was quite clear, and only 375 bales were bought by all groups during the day.</p>
<p>The market price fell by 5 jiao. The amount bought by each group is as follows:</p>
<p>Nanjing 10, Zhenjiang 10, Guangdong 280, Inland 45, Dealers 10, Wuhu 10. Inland Groups Hedged Bidding Cotton.</p>
<p>The cotton market initially rose and then fell, but American cotton, which had fallen for many days in a row, suddenly rebounded. However, with gold prices falling sharply, and partly because of good weather and good new cotton production, the yarn market was poor, and each factory's intention to buy was stagnant. There were many inland groups hedging. The new cotton from each area was listed earlier than in previous years, and the market price of Ningbo Yao cotton was becoming cheaper. However, there were those who covered their positions to make a profit.</p>
<p>Zheng Label High and Then Low</p>
<p>The Zheng label market opened tightly in the morning,</p>
<p>but speculators sold off when prices rose, and the</p>
<p>market turned weak. Each month rose by 1 jiao to 2.5 jiao. In the afternoon, due to the poor yarn market and little spot trading, there was a slight sell-off, and each month fell by 3 jiao to 4 jiao. The total trading volume for the day was 128,600 dan. Of these, Ren Feng sold 4,000 dan, Yuan Da 2,900 dan, Chen Ji 3,700 dan, Tong Xing 2,600 dan, Yi Yu 2,800 dan, and Yi Feng 3,200 dan. Yuan Da bought 3,300 dan, Da Fu 2,400 dan, Chun Ji 2,600 dan, Da Feng 5,100 dan, Yuan Xing Chang 7,100 dan, Chang He 3,900 dan, and Rong Xing 4,200 dan. Closing prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Zheng Label Closing Prices, Gains/Losses, and Inventory: December 4185, down 1026,600; August 4700, up 10124,800; January 4180, 1591,800; October 4200, down 25161,200. Total: 661,000; November 4185, 10177,600.</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Arrived and Sales Were Quiet</p>
<p>The demand for spot cotton was flat. Factories had not</p>
<p>opened, and there were no goods arriving at the docks.</p>
<p>Yao Cotton 57.50, Yoshida Yang Bank purchased 500 bales of new cotton, seeing sharp gains of 60 to 70 pounds for American cotton to be delivered to the New Warehouse.</p>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton rebounded due to strong activity in Wall Street and short covering, and the market was active and firm. Futures rose by 66 to 75 pounds, and spot rose by 65 pounds. British cotton futures rose by 19 points, and spot fell by 6 points. Egyptian cotton spot fell by 9 points. The Indian cotton market was quiet, with Pingar down 7.5 jiao, Oomra down 1 rupee 7.5 jiao, and Bai Luoxi down 3 rupees 2.5 jiao. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram of the 17th).</p>

<h3 id="e208">Sluggish Bidding for Flour <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market generally showed a stable trend after the morning session. With foreign wheat prices rising in Chicago by 6-7 to 9 jiao and in Canada by 8-9 jiao to 1 yuan, the opening prices boosted morale. Near and far terms were about half a fen better than the previous day. However, although the overseas atmosphere seemed slightly better, actual sales in various regions remained sluggish. As a result, it was difficult to stimulate buying interest from both inside and outside the industry. By the afternoon opening, near-term months were generally hovering without much fluctuation. Far-term months initially remained stable, but news that the US monetary policy was unlikely to succeed dampened morale. The future hinges on improved actual sales. As a result, August and September were unchanged, October and November were up by 2.5 li, and December and January were up by 5 li.</p>
<p>Fewer Buyers in After-Market Wheat Futures</p>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market generally showed a stable and bullish trend after the morning opening. With foreign wheat prices rising in Chicago by 6-7 to 9 jiao and in Canada by 8-9 jiao to 1 yuan, and no surge in selling, some people expected higher prices, and the opening prices for each month were slightly better, about 3-4 fen better than the previous day. However, trading turned quiet. As the afternoon opening approached, the flour market did not see much movement, and most buyers held back. Near-term months were again weak, while far-term months were slightly more favorable. As a result, August and September were unchanged, October was up by 1 fen, November was up by 3 fen, and December was up by 1 fen. The spot wheat market saw a rebound in trading, but most of the high-quality goods were in warehouses and had not yet been sold immediately. Medium and lower grades remained stable. Qingjiangpu wheat opened at 3 yuan 7 jiao 7 fen, Zhener wheat at 3 yuan 7 jiao, Jiangyan wheat at 3 yuan 6 jiao 8 fen, Yaowan wheat at 3 yuan 7 jiao 1 fen, Gaoyou wheat at 3 yuan 5 jiao 9 fen, Xinghua wheat at 3 yuan 5 jiao 1 fen, lower grade at 4 jiao 9 fen, Yangzhou wheat at 3 yuan 4 jiao 6 fen, lower grade at 3 jiao 5 fen, Nanjing wheat at 3 yuan 8 fen, lower grade at 1 jiao 8 fen, Shuangfeng wheat at 3 yuan 2 jiao 7 fen, a total of 12,000 bales, which were handled by Fuxin.</p>
<p>Rice Prices Rise by More Than 1 Jiao</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources were from over 20 firms, and both wholesale and retail remained similar. The market situation showed a firm trend due to continued scarcity of arrivals. Sellers were particularly eager to sell, so the market prices for thick japonica rice, thin indica rice, and Duyang tip rice rose by more than 1 jiao. The exchange rate has softened, and market prices have been adjusted by a resistance of 1 jiao. The new plant of Dongxing has not seen any significant changes. The total number of northern japonica rice packages was 700 to 800.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were about 30 sources from various areas of Hexia. The market for various goods was slightly active. The shape of the white glutinous rice market was loose in the morning and tight in the afternoon, leading to stable prices. The early thin glutinous rice captured high prices, killing the secondary grade, and the tips of the sheep rice and the top quality were priced steadily, while the secondary grade was soft. The prices of wharf tips and new and old customer tips were level and correct. Dujian rice was slightly weak. Dongxing japonica rice and Baiyuan rice did not see much movement.</p>
<p>Ningbo Merchants Try to Purchase Foreign Rice</p>
<p>| The Discount is Small Again by 3 Fen |</p>
<p>Yesterday, Japanese merchants continued to inquire about foreign indica rice, and customers from each area paid attention to foreign rice due to the lack of indica rice. However, after the market price of foreign rice stabilized, the owners were unwilling to sell it at a lower price, while the customers intended to lower it by another 1-2 jiao. Therefore, there were no transactions for several days. Yesterday, Ningbo merchants purchased 400 packages of small-grain rice from foreign merchants at a price of 6 yuan 8 jiao 2 fen, only 3 fen less than the previous market. Therefore, there were no large transactions, but if each group could transport and sell it at a reasonable price, they would continue to inquire about it in the future. The supplies of customer indica rice were scarce and the remaining rice was very small, so it was impossible for dealers to select what they wanted. Yesterday, only 120 packages of Wuxi Che indica rice were purchased by the Wontai merchants at a price of 6 yuan 6 jiao, and 50 packages of Dong indica rice that was processed without the husk in this street were purchased at a price of 5 yuan 1 jiao 3 fen. The market was similar to the previous one, but the price was more expensive due to the high quality of the goods.</p>
<p>[Ningbo Merchants Purchased New Green Soybeans from Liuhe]</p>
<p>The first batch of 58 packages of new green soybeans from Liuhe arrived the day before yesterday, and the price was opened at 4 yuan 1 jiao, purchased by the Ningbo merchants. It was heard that the purchase price needed to be around 5 yuan, so there were few arrivals. Yesterday, another two batches arrived, totaling 156 packages. The quality of the goods was similar to that of the previous batches, and they were still sold at 4 yuan 1 jiao to 4 yuan 0 jiao 4 fen, still purchased by the Ningbo merchants.</p>
<p>Sugar Market</p>
<h3 id="e209">Coarse Sand and White Sugar Plunge 2 Jiao <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>| The Prices of Tizhuang Qing Increased Instead |</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market suddenly weakened due to the decline in gold prices and the shrinking of the Dutch exchange rate. The association's quoted price for 24 coarse sand was initially 21 yuan, but later traded at 20 yuan 9 jiao, a drop of 2 jiao compared to the previous day. The quoted price for Dutch red sugar remained unchanged. The prices of Taikoo sugar were also slightly lower by 8 fen. B Mark was 21 yuan 4 jiao 5 fen, and DY Mark was 20 yuan 7 jiao 5 fen. China Guohua opened the price for crystal ice sugar at 25 yuan 6 jiao, 1 jiao lower than the previous day. The prices of No. 1, 2, and 3 ice sugar remained unchanged. Fine white sugar was lower by 5 fen. Top grade was 20 yuan 3 jiao, No. 1 was 1 jiao, No. 2 was 19 yuan 9 jiao, No. 3 was 7 jiao, and No. 4 was 5 jiao. Over 600 packages of new Chao Qing sugar from the Chaozhou merchant arrived and the market was quite lively, and they were immediately sold. The price of Tizhuang Qing sugar was 15 yuan 6 jiao to 4 jiao 5 fen, an increase of 1-2 jiao, secondary grade was 15 yuan, ordinary grade was 14 yuan 5 jiao to 14 yuan, and also 13 yuan 5 jiao.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea</p>
<h3 id="e210">The Flourishing Hankou Tea Market <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>｜Resurgence of British Tea Merchants in Purchasing｜</p>
<p>Hankou is the gathering place for black tea from the two Hunan and Hubei provinces. In recent years, the amount of tea has greatly decreased due to the devastation of the two provinces by the communist bandits. Furthermore, due to overproduction of tea in India and Ceylon for foreign sales, the British market was unable to promote sales, resulting in the entire Hankou market being manipulated by the Russian aid association. The market was in a state of decline. This year, the communist bandits were mostly eliminated in the tea-producing areas of Hunan and Hubei, and the British tea market also saw a depletion of inventory due to the results of several restrictions on production by British and Dutch tea merchants. Therefore, this year, Indian and Ceylonese tea prices are high, and British tea merchants have no choice but to switch to purchasing Chinese tea. In recent months, the black tea market in the two provinces has been exceptionally prosperous due to the opportunity for British sales to revive. According to statistics, the number of black tea cases loaded and sold by foreign firms is no less than 100,000. Except for 15,000 cases handled by Russian firms, the majority have been purchased entirely by British merchants. Chinese merchants, who have suffered losses for many years, have also benefited slightly, which was quite unexpected by most merchants.</p>
<p>Autumn Silkworms in Hangzhou Approaching Mounting Time</p>
<p>▲Autumn Silkworms in Chang'an Mounting Early as Leaves Thrive: In places like Chang'an, the silkworm season starts earliest. This year, farmers have greatly increased the number of silkworm eggs they are raising. The early batches have already undergone their major molt and the leaves are thriving. There are many silkworms and few leaves, and the price of leaves has already reached two yuan and forty or fifty cents. Mounting will occur shortly.</p>
<p>▲New Silk from Wuxi Factories Transported to Shanghai in Succession: Since the new silk reeling began in Wuxi silk factories, sales of new silk have been sluggish, and inventory has greatly increased. Now, small steamers are offering reduced prices to attract shipments of factory silk. In recent days, small steamers such as Zhaoshang have transported a total of 120 packages of white factory silk.</p>
<p>▲Japanese Artificial Silk Exports Not Weak: Since the price cuts and competitive sales, domestic sales have not been sluggish. Each month, more than 2,000 cases of Japanese artificial silk are transshipped from Shanghai. In the most recent week, the Yanjing and Changjiang Japanese mail steamers have shipped out another 600 cases.</p>
<p>▲No Hope for Turnaround in US Sales of Foreign Silk: There is no possibility of a turnaround in US silk sales in the short term. There is no telegram sent from Shanghai firms. Yesterday, only French firms took the opportunity to replenish missing goods. Xin Fu and others imported twenty packages of white factory silk and twenty packages of yellow factory silk. Prices remained weak.</p>

<h3 id="e211">Birth <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Cunren</p>
<p>A child is born, not knowing what he is to do in this world, nor whether his life will be happy or painful. He is simply here and must live on. If he knew that the road of life is not easy to walk, I think he would immediately starve himself to death. However, his parents, especially his mother, cherish him even more than they cherish themselves. Although they have some hopes for him, they don't necessarily have specific expectations for his future. People often hold a kind of commemorative ceremony for their birthday, which is said to have two meanings: one is to commemorate the nurturing grace of parents, and the other is to celebrate one's own survival. In this day and age, when we poor people encounter our birthday, I think it will instead arouse feelings of resentment. It is difficult to survive, and it is even more difficult to be a person. Even the day of birth is like the year of death. Survival is like a chicken rib, so what is there to celebrate or commemorate on a birthday? However, a certain great writer, because he escaped smallpox, said, "It is truly a blessing from heaven, and it would not be excessive to hold a celebration every year." There is another kind of brilliant insight regarding the meaning of birthday commemoration, which is that if one is "blessed by heaven," it would be concerning not to commemorate and celebrate. This kind of brilliant insight is certainly admirable, but it is only felt by those who are "blessed by heaven." People who are "blessed by heaven" are afraid of being kidnapped by bandits and worried about being robbed. They live in fear and trepidation throughout the year. Fortunately, with the blessing of the heavens, another year has easily passed to their birthday, so naturally, they must celebrate it greatly. What about us poor people? We have nothing to our name, and our two hands are our capital. Those who are employed fear losing their jobs, and those who are unemployed suffer from hunger and cold. Living a life on the edge, what is there to celebrate? However, we must also say that "Heaven has the virtue of cherishing life." Seeking to live is human nature, and being poor but strong is indeed something to celebrate. The rich can celebrate their birthdays, so why can't the poor eat longevity noodles?</p>
<h3 id="e212">Sacrificing for Religion <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Wei</p>
<p>Laborers who toil all day long in this deformed society feel that their lives should not be as mechanically dull, monotonous, and burdensome. They feel that they should have a kind of life force, a "vita," to regulate their exhausted bodies and gain some pleasure, or to get some spiritual nourishment and reduce some physical pain. So they are desperately pursuing it.</p>
<p>But what are they supposed to pursue? They often run into walls in bad environments. So they become passive and degenerate. Recently, a news item was discovered in the newspaper: a sixteen-year-old apprentice sacrificed himself for religion. This is a young man who ran from passivity into the path of blindness.</p>
<p>First, we must know that the young man who committed suicide was an apprentice in a store. Is the life of an apprentice interesting? Of course not. But he knew that he wanted to pursue some pleasure, but an apprentice and his environment cannot allow you to develop freely. So he still ran into the idealistic and hopeful group of religion. In addition, those missionaries desperately put on a compassionate face of saving people from suffering to invite them to the great path of their savior, especially working hard for a group of people who labor during the day, because that group of laboring people urgently needs a kind of spiritual nourishment. People without much education and thought feel that there is no way out of reality, so they are particularly enthusiastic in the religious faith. In religious belief, they are told to put aside the present and yearn for the future. I remember a poem:</p>
<p>Hundreds of millions of beings, be bold and endure:</p>
<p>For there is a better world to reward you! Originally, religion only gave him "unreachable grapes," so he committed suicide by borrowing the motive of the torn holy book.</p>
<p>Whose fault is this?</p>
<p>Finally, I still hope to follow Mr. Cai Yuanpei's words: "Let art replace religion" and pull the great number of masses out of anesthesia and onto a new path!</p>

<h3 id="e213">The Proliferation of Schools <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— Yin</p>
<p>｜Is it Progress? Or Decline?｜</p>
<p>Whenever we talk about any issue, whenever we are disappointed, and whenever we are at a loss for words, we all say: "This is due to the lack of widespread education. The only reliable remedy for the lack of public knowledge is to establish schools and popularize education." I walk the long, snaking XX Road every day. Although the fine sand on the road is blown away by the wind, my footprints have long since disappeared. Because I walk it every day, I am particularly familiar with everything on XX Road. What particularly catches my eye and awakens me is XX Public School, XX Middle School, XX Elementary School... etc. Some even have the grand and impressive inscription "Registered with the Municipal Bureau of Education" or "Approved by the Municipal Bureau of Education" above the school name. Ah! This is clearly a very "scenic" phenomenon. There are so many schools on XX Road. Ah! The proliferation of schools is quite a spectacle!</p>
<p>Because I am also a member of one of these schools, I pay particular attention to these things unintentionally. There are too many schools. Our school will be affected! If I have one less student, wouldn't that mean a few yuan less in tuition fees? Misfortune!</p>
<p>One day, feeling very bored, I went with a colleague to visit many of the nearby schools. There, one or two reception rooms no more than ten feet square were filled with a few desks that were barely shaped like desks and a small square blackboard. That was all. This kind of simplicity is what is called a "school," so it is no wonder that "schools" are proliferating. I could only sigh as I left.</p>
<p>This is completely a vestige or transformation of private schools. The fundamental difference is that instead of sitting and dozing off, there are now classes, breaks, and recesses. Instead of blindly reciting "Zhao Qian Sun Li...", it has changed to "yours," "mine," "dog," "cat," but what other beneficial improvements are there? Yes, the textbooks are too simple. Therefore, even those who know only three and a half characters can teach. The rate of unemployment in society has inflated at a high speed, so, due to the straits of livelihood, they have no choice but to use these "schools" as temporary shelters.</p>
<p>The most ridiculous thing is that I saw the following sentence on the badge of a certain school: "If siblings come together, tuition fees can be discounted by 5%." Ha! Thank you very much. The enthusiasm of the organizers of education, the unreserved promotion of the grand meaning of education, and the caring for the poor compatriots. There is also a certain school that even drew a "genuine" complete map of the school buildings in its recruitment advertisement - because they are so-called foreign-style houses! Ah! The predicament of the organizers of education. They want to use the school buildings to attract a general group of vain elementary school students and arouse their interest in studying. This is truly what is called "meticulousness."</p>
<p>In short, schools are proliferating on XX Road. "Is this phenomenon scenic? Is it strange? Is it progress or decline?" I think so!</p>

<p>Editor:</p>
<p>I am very grateful to you for answering my previous letter in your column. Now I have another unexpected problem to trouble you with. Please understand my difficulties. The matter of the missing money has not yet been resolved, and then there was a theft of more than a dozen five-cent postage stamps. Although it is a small matter, the suspicion is even more serious than before. I thought that a dozen stamps would not be used up in a short time, so that night, I secretly and carefully searched for them. Later, I found them in a colleague's drawer (where he puts books and other items). The next day, I publicly stated everything that had happened. He, in order to deny what he had done, had no choice but to use a trick, claiming that others had framed him. Everyone also asked in unison whether there was a second witness when the stamps were found. Ah! This was a clue found in secret, so of course there was no second witness. Sir, isn't this like lifting a stone only to drop it on one's own foot? I really have no way to defend myself. Otherwise, would such a small matter be likely to be brought to court? Sir, could you answer me with a better solution?</p>
<p>I would rather sacrifice other things than lose my reputation. I am now waiting for your good news! Sincerely yours, Gu Yueyi</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Previously, Mr. Gu wrote to us asking for advice because he was suspected of stealing money from the store. Our answer was to tell you to secretly pay attention: people who are used to doing business without capital (thieves) will definitely not stop there. You only need to catch them the second time, and the truth will be revealed. Now, as we expected, the second theft has been discovered. The reason why you have ended up harming yourself is entirely because your procedures were not precise. Lifting a stone and ending up hurting your own foot is entirely because you are weak or did not lift it properly. If you were strong enough, how could you harm yourself? If, after finding the stamps, you had not immediately reported it publicly, but had observed him with a cold eye, and then caught him after he used the stamps, how could he have blamed it on others?</p>
<p>So this time our answer is still the same as before. Fortunately, they only have suspicion of you, and there is no more serious situation that forces you to seek a quick resolution. In the future, if you encounter an opportunity, you should pay special attention to the procedures to avoid being bitten back. Litigation is unnecessary, and indeed unnecessary.</p>

<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Old Woman: Yes! What can you do when you encounter such a thing? Unfortunately, my second child was taken away by the enemy to carry bullets, and it has been more than twenty days now, and he has not returned. Who knows if he is even alive? My second daughter-in-law cries at home hating heaven and earth all day long. Her poor eyes are swollen from crying, but what's the use?</p>
<p>Middle-aged Man C: But thinking about it again and again, since it is for the sake of the country, there is no way to blame anyone. As long as we can repel the enemy and recover the three northeastern provinces, even if we become beggars, it is better than being a subjugated people. What do a few head of livestock matter?</p>
<p>Middle-aged Man: But then again, haven't we already paid our grain and taxes? As the saying goes, "Raising soldiers for a thousand days, using them for one morning." Now that we have fought a battle with Japan, we are again asking our common people to carry guns and horses. Isn't that too much?</p>
<p>Middle-aged Man B: Of course. The civil war already left us destitute and ruined. Now that we are fighting foreigners, it will inevitably take our lives even more.</p>
<p>Old Woman: It's strange, even the bodhisattvas are not working in these times. During the first month, I drew a fortune stick in this temple. It said that we had to wait until the Yellow Bull Mountain produced the True Son of Heaven in the third month for the world to have peace. But it has been so long now, and the Son of Heaven should have been born long ago, but there is still no peace. Who knows what's going on?</p>
<p>Middle-aged Man B: The bodhisattvas are never reliable.</p>
<p>Old Man: You can't say that. Hasn't the True Son of Heaven in Jinan Prefecture, Shandong, already created the divine bull carriage? But the time hasn't come yet. We still have to suffer a little more. Perhaps the Jade Emperor wants us to suffer more so that he can see if the beings in the lower realm will repent. For example, last year's Water and Land Dharma Assembly in Beijing could have liberated all beings, but the people were not taught to be pure, abstain from slaughter, and fast, so not only did it not move the gods, but it angered the Jade Emperor, who sent the god of slaughter to descend and kill a hundred thousand eight thousand. Who knows if the head of this village is not the reincarnation of the god of slaughter? In short, China's destiny has come to an end. The will of Heaven is so, and there is no way to change it.</p>
<p>Child: Then hasn't Emperor Puyi already ascended the throne? Why are we still fighting here and there?</p>
<p>Middle-aged Man C: You are just a child. What do you know? It is precisely because he has ascended the throne that he has to fight for the world.</p>
<p>Middle-aged Man A: You can't say that. This time, we fought past the Great Wall, but it's not because Puyi wants to fight. It's the Japanese who came up with the idea. Puyi is just a puppet.</p>
<p>Old Woman: I heard that this Emperor Puyi is still very young.</p>
<p>Old Man: That's right. He's the same age as my youngest child, born in the year of the horse. He's only twenty-eight years old this year. So, if fate has determined that he is to be an emperor, he will always be an emperor. But this kind of emperor cannot be relied on.</p>
