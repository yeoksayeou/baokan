<h3>讀西蒙請求自治之願電</h3>
<p>— 梓</p>
<p>西蒙錫林果勒盟副長德王等請許高度自治之願（九月十四日）。電政府於前日非下在式發表。吾人循誦再四。殊無從覓得其此次自治運動之眞實理由。願電前段以四百數十字陳述其自治運動之緣起。細讀之皆二十餘年來國内軍人通電之常習語句也。其曰外蒙奪於俄。東蒙淪於日西蒙牽動。千鈞一髮。則確當之結論。應爲西蒙急與中央密切合作。以求自保。乃竟不此之謂。而曰「當局不暇自救。吾蒙古何忍以恊助責望中央。」曰「風波所及。積弱之蒙疆。勢降蠶食殆盡。深貽中央之憂。藩籬破決將以亡命蒙古。累及同胞。…舍自决自治外。復有何法。」此種不合論理之牽張語句豈能作爲自治運動之理論根據乎。願電中可以重視者。爲報告七月二十六日百靈廟會議議定採用高度自治。設立内蒙自治政府。爲陳述一切對外措施。惟中央是頓。並望當局彌縫其闕而敎以所不及此足表示西蒙自治運動之形態與性質者也。</p>
<p>吾人於獲讀德木楚克楞魯普等電文以後。可以明白西蒙之形勢。尙在易於挽回之時機。其挽回之能否成功。惟視當局應付手段之如何耳。此不特本月九日百靈廟二次會議列席人數稀少之事實。足以爲證。即就願電措辭。亦可審知之。今日當局俏能急用治　之法。羈麽少數蠢蠢思　之丙蒙青年有力分子。使不發動。同時進行治本方策。從政治方面。　固西蒙内向之心則日本操縱西蒙自治之企圖。未始不能阻遏也。</p>
<p>黃紹雄趙丕廉奉派巡視西蒙所負之使命。實甚重大。然二人奉派以後。迄未北上。豈昧於緩急之情勢。而不明日本陰謀之亟亟進行乎。抑畏罹前途之艱難。而觀望趦趄乎。要知事在人爲。行貴迅速。昔外蒙爲帝俄操縱。元年以後。即行獨立。乃八年六月徐樹錚突至庫倫用迅捷之手腕竟使之一度宣布取銷自治使無國内急激之政爭。則外蒙今日或不至此黃趙行裝已整。中央對西蒙方針。十七日行政院會議。亦已通過因述答樹錚奮事。以促黃趙之速行並望二人能施展其手腕。挽回西蒙之形勢。以遏止日人勢力之西進。</p>
<h3>八省糧食會議　湘代表之談話</h3>

<p>（東京）　本日臨時閣議承認五相會議决定事項後、議决如下、</p>
<p>（一）日本對國際關係、以世界和平爲目的、用外交手段、貫澈日本方針、</p>
<p>（二）國防工作、以不受他國威脅與外侮爲標準、並留意調和日本國力、</p>
<p>此項决議、明示政府國策原則、與國民之所向、故政府决定不發表别種聲明書、（二十一日日聯電）</p>
<h3>廣田政策内容</h3>
<p>（東京）　五相會議决定之外交·國防·政策之具體問題、因各省意見未見一致、决定於將來由各省事務局繼續談判、但其大綱先行决定、作爲現内閣對時局之根本的應付方策、二十一日之臨時閣議席上、將由廣田外相口頭報告五相會議决定事項其内容如下、</p>
<h3>基本要項</h3>
<p>日本政府於滿洲事變後退出國聯、對外關係頗形緊張、且世界經濟會議之破局、促進世界經濟帝國主義之對立、更爲尖銳化、最近德國之退出國聯與軍縮會議、益使現下客觀情勢險惡、日本在此情形之下、不得不覺悟對中·俄·美·各關係之極爲嚴重、現内閣因痛感樹立對内外的充分政策之必要、决定確立應付和戰兩樣之外交軍備充實方策、</p>
<h3>對美政策</h3>
<p>日本鑒於英國任遠東之地位、及一九三五年二次華盛頓會議、海軍軍縮問題、須應注其最大力於日美關係之調情、即日本對美政策、在外交方面清算兩國從來一切關係、在軍事方面確立保持與美均等勢力之原則、此乃安定日本在遠東地位之政策也、</p>
<h3>對俄政策</h3>
<p>蘇俄聯邦始終實行其革命外交、且所有現在世界最有力之軍備、時常威脅日本共同防衛同盟國之「滿洲國」、故日本要凖備充分之陸軍軍備、對外方面取冷靜的待機姿勢、一面處理兩國間懸案之解决、以計兩國國交之調整、</p>
<h3>對華政策</h3>
<p>滿洲事變以來極度惡化之中日關係、自華北停戰恊定成立以後漸次緩和、然證明中國變更對日政策之具體事實、未見實現故尙不許樂觀、今後對華政策、有退進兩國親善關係之必要、而此項親善政策、於對美對俄政策之完全實行、始能逹到目的、</p>
<h3>對英政策</h3>
<p>英日關係、以世界經濟不次之深化、其在世界市場　易　爭愈激化、而致兩國關係更爲險惡、然英國傳、的遠東政策、採取日美兩國勢力之兩分主義、故日本應利用美國在遠東勢力、</p>
<h3>一秀政策</h3>
<p>日與法·德·比·等歐洲諸國維持友好關係、對於印度·南菲·及中美南美等、日本經濟的重要市塲、實行不斷的政治工作、以伸張經濟勢力、（二十一日日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）　五相會當初軍部大臣與財政外交兩大臣之間關於時局及國防之意見、有相當懸隔、而屢次傳其危機、然交換論戰之結果、五相之間、意見漸次接近、遂於二十日會議完全一致、經二十一日閣議正式决定、政局危機、亦因此告一段落、今後所注目的爲如何確立内政間題、但政府現已樂觀所謂政局之不安似已消滅矣、（二十一日日聯電）</p>

<p>日俄關係緊張聲中</p>
<h3>李維諾夫將訪白宫談判美俄復交　羅斯福加列寗函電往還　十六年懸案謀一朝解决　美承認蘇俄實現在卽遠東危機一服清醒劑</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）美總統羅斯福與蘇俄外交委員李維諾夫行將在白宫寗靜之空氣中、對於一九一七年十一月七日使美俄絕交之各問題、覓致一共同之諒解、</p>
<p>據今日白宫發表、美總統與蘇俄中央執行委員會主席加列寗衆已交換函電、同認兩國間現有狀况、應於可能時謀其終止、美總統去函係十月十日發出、内　今吾兩國間猶未克一通聘問之使、實爲最可憾事、鄙人自柄政以來　即欲謀所以終止此現象、嗣乃指陳凡所以影響兩國邦交諸問題、雖屬嚴重　但非不可解决、並謂倘閣下同具此心、則鄙人樂於接待尊處所派代表、研究諸懸案　但當附有諒解、此種討論、不拘束兩國今後之行動云云、加列寗旋於十月十七日覆稱、渠完全贊同美總統之意見、特派李維諾夫赴美、並谓兩國京城彼此未有大使駐剳　不僅在兩國間發生不利影響、且益增全世界之隍阢、使樹立國際和平之努力、愈見複雜云云</p>
<p>現李維諾夫何時可以抵美、白宫猶未接報告、但據白宫中人表示、李氏抵美後、將居白宫、爲美總統上賓、並信一切談將出以非正式、對於俄國革命時没收美人財産及不承認前此公債等問題、必當加以詳細討論、美總統於發表此事經過時　未作任何保證語、僅謂渠殊未見此懸擱十六年之問題、有不應加以討論之理由在也、（二十日國民電）</p>
<p>（莫斯科）　此間與華盛頓同時發表美俄行將進行談判消息後、即聞李維諾夫將偕秘書二三人、大約於下星期内啓程赴美、李夫人亦將偕行、李氏抵美京後、將有現駐華盛頓之非正式代表史堪維斯基及阿姆篤格公司總理博格逹諾夫加入代表團、兩人在美、與金融善後公司職員時常接洽、且曾密切注意美國對俄與論之趨向、蘇俄官吏雖咸贊同美總統主張、認此次談話、不當拘束兩國今後行動、但人人信此舉爲趨向復交之第一步、其結果定將導至互相承認、並謂此項新發展、與德國退出軍縮國聯所造成之歐洲局勢、完全無關、但信在國際大局上、當可有一服清醒劑之效果、某要人並謂此舉兼可解弛遠東之緊張云、（二十一日國民電）</p>
<h3>兩國經濟俱蒙裨益</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）　此間外交界大都信此舉在兩國經濟方面觀察、乃屬勢所必然、某外交代表謂此事形勢、絕類菲島獨立問題、數年前、獨立問題猶爲一般人所嗤視、卒以農民欲減少銷貨競爭之願望、産生菲島獨立運動、今則因銷貨國外之願望、急欲獲得蘇俄市場、甚致出以完全承認蘇俄之代價、亦　甘心云云、（二十日路透電）</p>
<p>華沙　蘇聯與美國談判承認問題、此間聞訊甚表滿意、一般人以爲美國承認蘇聯政府之舉、在政治經濟上、均有利益、美俄兩國在世界經濟上占有重要地位、一旦恢復通常關係、則世界信用恐慌、自必爲之減輕云、（二十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>參院批准不成問題</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）　今日美參議員之表、意見者、類皆遵循本　立塲而同時亦尊重政府承認蘇俄之願望、以故逆料美總統不論成立任何恊定、將來提出參院、定可批准無疑、自白宫發表羅斯羅與加列寗通問消息後、參議員波拉即宣稱、倘美政府承認蘇俄、渠將助之、波拉自博亞斯致電此間聲稱、此舉對於世界互相容忍方面、已前進一步、美國早當爲之不待今日、其他參議員亦多稱譽總統所採排除一切直前逕進之手段叚、金融界初期評論、亦多表示贊同、（二十日國民電）</p>
<h3>東京方面深切注視</h3>
<p>（東京）　外務部發言人今晨得悉羅斯福總統請蘇俄執行委員會主席加里寗至華盛頓會談消息後宣稱、此訊極可注意、該發言人又謂外傳日本不願美國承認蘇俄之說實無根據、渠不信美國此舉與目前俄日凶惡戰爭風雲有任何關係云、（廿一日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）　關於美俄將開始外交涉問題、日軍部今日下午發表談話云、軍部尙未接　公表、眞相未甚　白、照向來之大勢觀察、美政府對俄將提起克倫斯基政府時代之債務及歐洲大戰之債、若蘇聯果承認美國之要求、日亦有數萬萬元之債權、則中東路案亦立刻可以解决、若美國對蘇聯放棄戰債而承認蘇俄、將來對歐洲各聯合國之戰債亦要受累、美國政府果能发发此種犠牲與否、現時尙難預斷、而且美國在鄕軍人團反對蘇俄尤烈羅斯福亦不致冒險承認俄國、或謂美國爲欲牽制日本而聯俄、不過日本所受者僅爲精神上之打撃而已、美國承認俄國、遲早總可以實現、在近十三年間時常有此種運動　至今尙未見其實現、甚爲可怪、（廿一日華聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）　外務省發言人今日評論美俄交換開始復交談判文件事、謂日本已於數年前正式承認蘇俄　今聞其他多國亦將予以承認、殊爲欣慰、如美俄復交、不僅有益於兩國、亦將有益於其他諸國、美俄復交後、美國國家復興程序及蘇俄第二五年計畫、進行均可便利、因美國可獲俄國大批商業定單、俄國將輸出大批原料至美也、（二十一日路透電）</p>
<h3>李維諾夫月杪啓程赴美　擬在巴黎倫敦小作勾留</h3>
<p>（莫斯科）　蘇俄外交委員李維諾夫現擬於本月底乘輪赴美、今日下午李氏已電囑駐英駐法兩大使署立即查報本日至下月五日　開赴紐約之船期、聞李氏擬取道巴黎倫敦稍事勾留、因蘇俄與英法之貿易恊定談判、此時正在進行中也、今日下午俄官屬聲稱、若輩冀望李維諾夫與美總統談話結果、當可獲得美政府之宣告承認蘇俄繼以兩國之互換使節與領事並料行將設立混合委員會、解决美俄間債務問題、俄官塲此種表示、足見蘇俄對於美國要求之債務、已願稍稍妥洽、此亦足以消除兩國復交前途之最大障礙者也、此外、料將另設一委員會、完成商務合同商訂放欵購貨辦法、（二十一國民電）</p>
<h3>美議員擁護復交主張　國内反對勢力微弱</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）　國會議員現在華盛頓者、幾於全贊成羅斯福復交之主張、其理由有二、（一）美俄國交恢復、則美國商務大受其益、（二）美俄恢復外交關係、則美國在遠東對於日本所處地方、得以鞏固、美國參戰軍人會及美國勞工聯合會對於承認蘇俄問題、雖表示反對、但羅斯福置諸不顧、而堅决行其政策、參議院前外交委員會主席波拉、謂羅斯福承認蘇俄計晝若能成功、可謂天亶聰明、（二十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>美國費城　參議院外交委員會委員共和黨參議員李德發表宣言、謂聞羅斯福總統邀請蘇俄代表來華盛頓、討論美俄復交、甚爲不快、緣美國不當邀請蘇俄代表來此、如總統欲承認蘇俄則承認之可也云、又參議院外交委員會、另一共和黨委員魯濱遜則宣言、謂承認蘇聯乃爲放胆之措置且與美國人民利益相反云、（二十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>日本益陷孤立</h3>
<p>（莫斯科）　美俄兩國鑒於全世界尤其遠東大局之危機　刻已正談判恢復正式國交問題、此間外交方面僉認美俄復交結果、將使日本益趨孤立、而中國將來外交政策之趨向、亦成極有味之問題、（廿一日中央社電）</p>
<h3>美國商務活動</h3>
<p>（紐約）　垣街有銀行數家、因欲便利美國與蘇俄商務關係、對於蘇俄駐美商務恊助會所出期票、即將予以貼現、並擬直接貨予欵項、以便購買貨物、即聯邦政府聞亦凖備貸欵與蘇俄、或爲之擔保貨價美俄商務關俄一經恢復　受其益者大半爲工業機械工廠、美國對俄出品貿易在一九三○年共有三萬萬三千萬元之多、至一九三二年乃降至一千五百萬美元、美國出品商希望以後每年至少能回復一萬萬三千萬元之數、輿論對於銀行家上項計晝無不贊成之表示、因此有人謂政府對於承認蘇俄各種先决條件、不擬再行提出、即（一）美國從前借予克倫斯基臨時政府之欵共計一萬萬九千二百萬美元、不再要求蘇俄先行承認償還、（二）美國人民財産、在蘇俄境内被没收者、不再要求蘇俄先行承認發還、（三）蘇俄債券四萬萬四千一百萬美元、亦不要求事先承認償還、（四）蘇俄不必預先承諾不在美國作共産宣傳、一般人以爲似此能令雙方均能滿意之妥恊、蘇俄政府决不致拒不接受云、（二十日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>莫斯科報紙暢論美俄關係</h3>
<p>（莫斯科）　蘇聯政府公報「伊斯維斯太」謂美俄函件之交換、非唯給予兩國輿論以巨最之滿意、抑且予一切熱忱維護並鞏固世界和平之人羣以滿意也、該報續謂、「羅斯福致加里寗之函件、在今日國際關係之黑暗背境中、實爲一可喜的事件、美國人民對於蘇聯日益增加之關心反映於下述傳播日廣之信仰　即在兩國間最廣汎的各方面的合作上、均存有特殊之優惠條件是也、蘇聯在十六年中已與其隣國及世界上最重要之國家、創立穏固而正常之關係、在此等關係中蘇聯恪遵不干涉之原則及經濟合作之原則、始终不變、如另一方面亦能遵從此種國際來往之基本規則、不僅蘇聯與資本主義國家間關係之正常發展、毫無障碍、且此種發展、對於雙方並有裨益、蘇聯在有關兩國之問題中所處之地位、美國知之已稔、此種地位得引起下述堅定之信念、即將來李維諾夫與羅斯福將以互相諒解之精神進行談判、且此項談判必　能早日得圓滿結果也、」該報結論謂、「蘇美間正常的政治與經濟關係之建立、不僅足以塡補現存之缺陷、此種缺陷剥奪兩國得由此種關係産生之便利）吾人並願信任、彼將構成兩大國家親善之初步、此舉當爲和平之虔誠友人歡迎無疑」云、蘇聯共産黨言論機關眞理報謂、羅斯福之信件表示美國放棄其以前對付歐亞最大國家之政策、此種放棄、表示美國資産階級之領袖　最後亦竟信任彼等有改途易轍之必要、彼等不得不將蘇維埃聯邦在國際界中占最重要地位之事實、加以考慮同時此中事實如被忽視、則必損害其自身利益無疑也　至於任命李維諾夫前往討論關係兩國問題之事實、則該報以爲正足表示蘇聯政府之重視未來之談判、並審愼處理此項具有特殊重要性質之局面也該報指明一般冒險主義者、正欲利用現時國際情勢、俾將世界納入新的災禍中、並發問曰「誰能懹疑蘇美間之正常關係將再創造一種勢力之相關、而令努力破壤和平之冒險家亦不得不加顧慮者」、重工業人民委員會機關報「工業化」稱、蘇聯政府在「貿易而未得承認」之狀態中、</p>
<p>僅爲代表全球面積六分之一及一萬六千五百萬人民之委托之買方與賣方、蘇聯經濟界在討論第二届五年計劃中之輸入計劃時、當已預料此種華盛頓談判所能産生之結果、此　結果將予蘇美貿易之發展以强烈之推動、彼等希望在與蘇聯之貿易上、最後終將採取「美國式的規模」、而迄今仍局限於「幼稚之規模」云、共産主義表年聯盟機關報「青共眞理報」云、羅氏信件適於整個資本主義世界面、對一新的悲慘局面之時來到、如遠東之衝突、日蘇關係之緊張、日美在太平洋之競爭、德國之脫退國聯、軍縮會議遭逢之僵局、資本主義列强爲新鮮屠殺之勢病樣準備、以上所述爲若干最重要之問題、每個問題包含足令下届爆發之火藥一蘇美親善必影響於今日之世界政局、且能加强國際間之和平」云、紅軍機關報「紅星」指明蘇美關係、在目下竭度緊張之局面中、具有萬分之重要性、該報以爲兩國間正常關係之建樹、不僅改變目下之國際局勢、並將阻滯新的武裝衝突之爆發云、「經濟生活報」表示其意見云、蘇美正常關係之建立、現倍覺自然、因予等洞悉美國對於蘇聯作特别活躍之關心也、該報以爲蘇美兩國之經濟關係　將到逹宏大之規模、因宏偉而高度發展之美國工業、具有巨大之可能、以供應我國在空前廣大之規模内完成其工業化計劃時之需要云、（二十一日塔斯電）</p>

<p>昨晨五時許、閘北共和新路中山路口菜圃中、忽發生槍殺案、被殺者係一菜販、茲將各情分誌如下</p>
<h3>同居發生暗殺</h3>
<p>宿遷少婦、王小妹、（卽徐王氏）現年二十一歲、頗具姿色、當二年前、小妹年方十八、卽在原籍宿遷地方、被一無賴名孫恒元者、（現年三十一歲）誘追成姦、並將伊拐帶來滬、匿居楊樹浦太和待平屋内、雙宿雙飛、儼如夫婦、惟孫　事生産、終日與流氓等爲伍、因此生計日絀、無以爲生、會有同居之宿遷人名徐克明者、年方二十六歲、係業菜販、尙未聚妻、因彼此係屬同居、朝夕會面、不免噓寒問煖、更以孫徐處境不同、故不久小妹竟與徐克明發生暗味、雙方熱戀逹於極點、惟以孫在、總覺不妥、乃彼此商議遠走高飛之計、</p>
<h3>男女法院互控</h3>
<p>詎事機不密、早被孫恒元窺破　情、乃於本年者具狀地方法院、控徐對小妹通姦拐逃罪、而王小妹亦同時以意圖誘賣罪反訴孫恒元、曾經地院一再審訉、以雙方所控均無證據提出、乃諭不受理處分、嗣後徐與小妹、卽私由楊樹浦遷至閘北普兽山莊後普善路草屋内、實行同居、徐並在共和路小菜場内擺設菜擁、故每晨必先往大場　販買各種蔬菜、及午方回、雖不能豐衣足食、但亦頗堪温飽、意爲從此可得安逸度日矣、詎好景不常、徐與小妹住處、竟被孫恒元探悉、孫並曾於半月前經警舊路、窺探徐等起居行動、當時小妹等亦曾見孫、惟以彼此早已情斷意絕、故未介意、</p>

<h3>自由談不歡而散</h3>
<p>— 盧子</p>
<p>歪嘴阿四是别相人，小癩痢也是别相人，雖然大家都是吃的尋事生非＊</p>
<p>訛詐抵賴的「别相飯」，因爲各有各的「地段」，各有各的「戸頭」，＊</p>
<p>所以儘能「井水不犯河水」，各相干。</p>
<p>但若一旦歪嘴阿四「不識相」，「招呼」都不打一個，而到小癩痢「地界」上＊</p>
<p>去「拆外快」的話，那麽，爲了「面子」的關係，小癩痢自然不肯干休，而得＊</p>
<p>給些「顔色」給歪嘴阿四看。所謂「顔色」也者、就是擯拳勒臂，一把領口的＊</p>
<p>打起架來。</p>
<p>這麽一拳一脚之下，照理呢，雖躺下而挨打的，就算是輸定的了，但是＊</p>
<p>在「别相人界」中却不然。雖然給對手方打得頭破血流了，當從地下爬起來＊</p>
<p>，拍着屁股逃走時，嘴裏還得嚷着「有種的，明天十點鐘上湖心亭」，那意＊</p>
<p>思是說，「你若是好漢，明天十點鐘上湖心亭吃講茶」。</p>
<p>在「别相人界」裏，人家約着「吃講茶」而不去，以後便休想再有「面子」吃＊</p>
<p>「别相人飯」，所以到了時候，雙方的「老頭子」，「同産弟兄」，以及「徒弟」＊</p>
<p>之輩，便會羣賢畢至，少長咸集，於是乎雙方面紅耳赤地大講其「經頭」。＊</p>
<p>「經頭」順利的，由雙方「老頭子」作主「呌開」大家都不再把這一回事「擱在心上」，和好如初＊</p>
<p>。若是「呌不開」的話，那麽由一方提出條件，要對方備酒「拉檯面」。這自然已有曲直之分了＊</p>
<p>。若是曲的方面，甘心陪不是，自然萬事全休。若是曲的那方不甘心的話，那麽，大家便一＊</p>
<p>塲没結果，不歡而散。</p>
<p>不歡而散之後，雙方便都趕着預備「鐵尺」「小斧頭」，「手槍」，「盒子砲」，實行「做」與「扳」＊</p>
<p>的最後手段，抵當做出了命案，「開碼頭」，或是「吃官司」。因爲不這麽，便不算「有種」，「＊</p>
<p>有面子」，而將不成其爲「别相人」。</p>
<p>爲了「奉奥之爭」，引起了「歐洲大戰」，而成立了「國際聯盟」，而談判「戰債」，「軍縮」，而＊</p>
<p>「德國退盟」。時至今日，已到了别相人吃講茶「不歡而散」的地步。那麽，今後的工作，自然＊</p>
<p>是只有預備了「鐵尺」「小斧頭」，實行「要你的命」那一手了。</p>
<h3>交際花</h3>
<p>— 左匀</p>
<p>交際本是人生事業最大的工具，在＊</p>
<p>上海差不多没有一個人不在研究＊</p>
<p>它的方式和功能：譬如某一種事業運用＊</p>
<p>何種交際方式纔能成功：某種享樂運用＊</p>
<p>何種交際方式纔能逹到目的。交際在每＊</p>
<p>個人的關係上是這樣的密切，所以莫不＊</p>
<p>受人人的重視。善於交際的男子，就被＊</p>
<p>人家恭維他爲交際家，交際博士；善於＊</p>
<p>交際的女子就被人家工恭維伊爲交際花。＊</p>
<p>現在要說的就是這交際花。</p>
<p>我們要研究交際花是怎樣形成的。交＊</p>
<p>際花的形成，伊必須具有下列幾個條件＊</p>
<p>：第一要是名門閨女，家境富有；第二＊</p>
<p>要面貌俊秀，口齒玲琍；第三要個性瀟＊</p>
<p>灑活潑。俱備以上的條件，伊的裝飾纔＊</p>
<p>會時新，伊的風度纔會動人。還有一個＊</p>
<p>重要的原因，大都是伊的家庭中已經有＊</p>
<p>了一個交際環境，像某名交際花是跟伊＊</p>
<p>哥哥跑慣了的，又有某名交際花是跟伊＊</p>
<p>姐姐跑出了頭的。交際花像這樣形成之＊</p>
<p>後，伊的言語行止，就在在的表示了伊＊</p>
<p>的特色</p>
<p>看伊是很年輕，不會懂什麽的，但是＊</p>
<p>伊的談話，是每一句包含着經騐，每一＊</p>
<p>事要表示着練逹。站起來或是坐倒，＊</p>
<p>行路或是止步，伊都有一種純熟老成的＊</p>
<p>姿態，顯露在活潑的身手中。伊不害羞＊</p>
<p>，在生人面前，伊要盡量的表示闊綽，＊</p>
<p>使你感覺到伊的不平凡，給你暗暗的羨＊</p>
<p>慕，這就是伊的成功。</p>
<p>所以交際花到處受人們的歡迎，因爲＊</p>
<p>伊有迎人的笑臉，更周到的應對：有伊＊</p>
<p>在，滿屋内逞現着活氣。但是交際花需＊</p>
<p>要的是和人們接觸，所以伊不能在家裏＊</p>
<p>有一個長時間的勾留。孤獨，寂寞是伊＊</p>
<p>最不能忍受的，歡樂的塲面和熱鬧的地＊</p>
<p>方，那是伊最喜歡參加的。社會人士爲＊</p>
<p>迎合伊們的心理起見、所以結婚時需要＊</p>
<p>交際花做賓相，游藝或彩排時需要交際＊</p>
<p>花來客串，舉行茶舞時又需要交際花來＊</p>
<p>號召。因爲交際花大半都是　能的，什＊</p>
<p>麽都熟習，什麽都願動一動，自然關於＊</p>
<p>娛樂的技能，每一種都是很精的。</p>
<h3>哭郭厚菴須靜</h3>

<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第十七回　孰能無懚家思灰上氣　兵不厭詐豪語壯軍心</p>
<p>趙自强對了那窗戸裏望了一望，回頭看到一個排長經過，便＊</p>
<p>向他笑道：劉排長，你們連長眞高興，這樣子忙的時候，＊</p>
<p>還有功夫唱戲。事情都料理清楚了嗎？劉排長道：大致差不多＊</p>
<p>。趙自强歎了一口氣，又點點頭道：這都是没有家眷的好處。＊</p>
<p>那個劉排長猛然聽到他這樣的解釋，倒有些不懂。祇管望了他＊</p>
<p>發怔。他言後也有點省悟，是自已說錯了便笑道，這話提起＊</p>
<p>來很長，若是你們連長閑着，給你談起來，你就明白了。於是＊</p>
<p>笑着回連而去。到了連部，上士王士立迎着道：連長　回去嗎＊</p>
<p>？趙自强祇搖了幾搖頭，却没有答復他的話。王士立看他那情＊</p>
<p>形，當然是牢騷已極，也就不問了。果然的這一來，趙自强＊</p>
<p>變了了態度，一點也不想家，祇管料理營裏的事務。到了晚上六＊</p>
<p>點鐘，兩個排長已經回來了這時要出營去，也不可能，自然＊</p>
<p>是作罷。到了次早六時，自已剛剛是起床，隨從兵進屋來說，＊</p>
<p>團長召集營連長會議。趙自强一聽，就知道要發表出發了。＊</p>
<p>離着凖備完畢的限期，還有大半天，這又有話說了，這事情眞＊</p>
<p>是一步緊逼了一步來；看這樣子，果然是合了田青那句話，一＊</p>
<p>定是去打最前線。打最前線固然是不必害怕，可是這樣的緊張＊</p>
<p>情形，一定是事情相逼得很厲害，呌自已猛然丢開老父，丢開＊</p>
<p>了愛人，眼睜睜的去冒這個危險去，心裏頭總也不能坦然。愛＊</p>
<p>國，這是個個人都應當去幹的事。可是照着打仗看起來，好像＊</p>
<p>愛國就是軍人一方面所應幹的事，不，並不是軍人應負這個責＊</p>
<p>任，祇是當團長以下的人應當負這個責任罷了。他如此想着＊</p>
<p>，很不經心的，向屋子外面。（二一九）</p>
<h3>告地狀</h3>
<p>— 虎頭</p>
<p>「做了三年呌化回來，請他做官也不＊</p>
<p>高興了。」這是時常有得聽見的＊</p>
<p>俗話：因爲做呌化，不用什麽本事，也＊</p>
<p>能夠掙錢，况且來的非常容易。做了三＊</p>
<p>年回來，身體懶散慣了，無論做什麽事＊</p>
<p>都覺得比呌化要爲難，所以情願沿門托＊</p>
<p>鉢過生涯了。</p>
<p>呌化也有好幾種方法：挨家排戸，呌＊</p>
<p>著娘娘太太去討錢，是一種：跟在黃包＊</p>
<p>車後面跑一叚討錢的，又是一種：黃包＊</p>
<p>車在橋上經過，帮着拉一把討錢的，又＊</p>
<p>是一種：裝着爛脚爛手，坐定一塊地＊</p>
<p>方，等着施主的，又是一種；用白粉在＊</p>
<p>水門汀上寫着不長不短的文字，談談近＊</p>
<p>來的苦况，及所以流落到此的緣由，希＊</p>
<p>望路過的人，讀其文而施與的，又是一＊</p>
<p>種。……這些呌化方式之中，一二三三＊</p>
<p>種最難掙錢，至多討到一個板，已算＊</p>
<p>萬幸了，若要討滿一塊錢，眞不知要跑＊</p>
<p>幾多脚步咧！第四　第五種比較的便當＊</p>
<p>些　可是第四種是苦肉計。把手或脚弄＊</p>
<p>得血滴滴地，被朝山進香的愚夫愚婦看＊</p>
<p>見了，動着惻隠之心施捨些。第五種呌＊</p>
<p>化，便呌做告地狀，或者也有些小本＊</p>
<p>領，能夠寫得一手好字，或者居然中西＊</p>
<p>文都能寫幾句，竟有風雅些的呌化，還＊</p>
<p>能哼幾首亂七八糟的詩。路過的仁人君＊</p>
<p>子，閱其字，讀其詩文，不期然而然的＊</p>
<p>動了憐才之念，纔服服貼貼地布施些，＊</p>

<h3>吳市長辭</h3>
<p>吳市長首致歡迎詞略謂、上海隊此次參加全運會、奪得男女總錦標、實爲本市有史以來最光榮之一頁、中國在革命過程中、建設新中國、復興民族運動最緊張之時、遭遇空前之國難、致一切事業俱受打撃、全國同胞日陷痛苦、實爲國家之重大損失、但我們相信其痛苦愈深、損失愈大、我們的舊門亦愈是勞力、所謂多難興邦、卽此之謂、中華民族將來之生命、全寄托在今日中國之青年身上、全國運動會卽是訓練青年之一步工件、上海市民此次對上海市選手抱有極大希望、故今日奪標回來、全市民衆興高彩烈、爲民族前途慶賀、但各位參加全運會之目的、並非在奪錦標、是要來綿延中華民族之生命、要復興民族、建設新中國、必須人人有能力、而能力是從學諭經騐中得來的、要培養學識經騐　須先有靈活的頭腦與健全的體魄、諸位參加全運之目的　卽在鍛練健全的體魄、使能運用腦子、充實能力、以建設新中國、而綿延中華民族之生命、我們對於上海市選手奪標歸來、卽對中國青年前途、抱了無窮的希望、不禁爲民族前途慶賀故今日慶祝勝利亦卽慶祝中華民族云、</p>

<h3>全國運動會與新聞界　寫在全運會結果以後　希望下次要改良才好</h3>
<p>— 馬蔭良</p>
<p>這次全國運動會給予我們新聞界的印象極深、我們認定全國運動會的目的、是在提倡國民體育、尤其在這國難重重中、增進國民體力更屬重要、而要逹到這目的、新聞界的宣傳負有最重大的使命、所以自從我們得到開會的消息後、無論在特質上在精神上、我們都拿出全副力量來帮助、我們認定這種工作、間接是爲全運會、爲政府、直接是爲全國民衆服務、可是我們的努力、使我們失望了、</p>
<p>爲了要逹到這提倡國民體育的目的、我們有二種要求、第一是報紙運輸及郵電拍發的便利、第一是場内采訪新聞的便利、</p>
<p>我們很感謝交通鐵道當局、給我們第一點要求完全滿足了如京滬路每次行車、總在太平門停靠、使會場上觀衆早些看到我們的報紙、京滬長途電話線的支配、郵政電報的設備、使大會的消息、早些傳佈出去、處處令人便利、他們明白、這是爲國家做事、所以能夠做到一分、卽是替國家盡了一分力量、這些却是令人佩服的、</p>
<p>可是這第二點要求、却使我們大大的失望、而且不但失望、更給我們無限的悲傷、最初是大會消息發表的不平等、使全國新聞界都不滿意、後來總算查明底細、當事人設法補救、方始了結、不道大會開幕又發生了兩件大事、</p>
<h3>（一）記者不准入塲</h3>
<p>試問新聞記者不得入塲、則會塲消息、從那裏去采訪這不是明明白白地拒絕我們去采訪嗎、（會塲司令台上坐的立的不相干的人很多、此地免談了、）幸而後來立刻解決、方得入塲又發生了這第二件事、</p>
<h3>（二）記者祇准入一塲</h3>
<p>試问大會會塲八九、競賽又多同時舉行、報紙如要得到全部消息、勢必有八九人不可、在這經濟落後的中國、在這尙未發逹的中國報業、是否都有派八九人的能力、這不是明明白白地同新聞界爲難嗎、此外童子軍的阻難新聞界、亦令人非常失望、我們覺得童子軍之維護會塲秩序的熱心、是應當十分感激的、不過這次的童軍們、好像常常過意同新聞記者作對、每逢記者入塲、總是嚴詞拒絕、有時上面已經有了命令、還是照樣拒絕、這種抗命的精神、眞可佩服、因此使我們精神上時間上上受到不少的損失、這都是童子軍所賜與的、</p>
<p>諸位、諸位主持大會的先生們、我們所要求的是大會消息、並非諸位的私産、我們所要求的是運動消息、並非外交軍事的秘密消息、再我們所做的工作、是替大會服務、就是替諸位服務、也就是替我們中華民族服務、這些都要請諸位明白的、我們這一次不惜增加篇幅、不惜增加版次、（如早版晚版號外等等）不惜犧牲精力、所爲的就是要滿足大會選手和觀衆的希望、使大家滿意這大會、使這大會逹到他的使命、不然我們又何必如此犧牲呢、</p>
<p>諸位、我們且不談世界運動會、遠東運動會招待新聞界的情形、但請看上次華北運動會是如何給全國新聞界的便利、（聽說此次全運運來對新聞界的種種方便、還是靠這幾位辦過華北運動會的先生爭來的）、再請看上次上海全市運動會是如何設法使各地的新聞記者便利、這些都是事實、大家想必還可記起來的罷、</p>
<p>好了、會已結束了、話也不必多說了、我們且希望下次的全國運動會改良才好、</p>

<h3>衝</h3>
<p>— 旅隼</p>
<p>「推」和「踢」只能死傷一兩個，倘要多，就非「衝」不可。</p>
<p>十三日的新聞上載着貴陽通信說，九一八紀念，各校學生集合游行，敎育廳長譚星閣臨事張皇、乃派兵分據街口，另以汽車多輛，向行列衝去，於是發生慘劇，死學生二人，傷四二餘，其中以正誼小學學生爲最多，年僅十齡上下耳。……</p>
<p>我先前只知道武將大抵通文，當「枕戈待旦」的時候，就會做駢體電報，這回纔明白華是文官、也有深諳韜略的了。田單曾經用過火牛，現在代以汽車，也確是二十世紀。</p>
<p>「衝」是最爽利的戰法，一隊汽車，橫衝直撞，使敵人死傷在車輪下，多麽簡截；「衝」也是最威武的行爲，機關一扳，風馳電掣，使對手想回避也來不及，多麽英雄。各國的兵警，喜歡用水龍衝，俄皇曾用哥薩克馬隊衝，都是快舉。各地租界上我們有時會看見外國兵的坦克車在出巡，這就是倘不恭順，便要來衝的傢伙。</p>
<p>汽車雖然並非衝鋒的利器，但幸而敵人却是小學生，一匹疲驉，眞上戰場是萬萬不行的，不過在嫩草地上飛跑，騎士坐在上面暗嗚叱咤，却還很能勝任愉快，雖然有些人見了，難免覺得滑稽。</p>
<p>十齡上下的孩子會造反，本來也難免覺得滑稽的。但我們中國是常出神童的地方，一歲能畫，兩歲能詩，七齡童做戲，十齡童從軍，原是常有的事實；連七八歲的女孩也會被凌辱，從别人看來，是等於「年方花信」的了。</p>
<p>况且「衝」的時候，倘使對面是能夠有些抵抗的人，那就衝車會弄得不爽利，衝者也就不英雄，所以敵人總須選得嫩弱。流氓欺鄕下老，洋人打中國人，敎育廳長衝小學生，都是善於克敵的豪傑。</p>
<p>「身當其衝」，先前好像不過一句空話，現在却應騐了這應騐不但在成人，而且到了小孩子。「嬰兒殺戮」算是一種罪惡，已經是過去的事，將乳兒抛上空中去，接以槍尖，不過看作一種玩把戲的日子，恐怕也就不遠了罷。</p>
<h3>談「别字」</h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>豐之餘先生從施蟄存先生的介紹莊子與文選，連類說到劉半儂先生的嘲笑青年的寫别字，說到「白話運動是勝利了，有些戰士，還因此爬了上去；但也因爲爬了上去，就不但不再爲白話戰鬭，並且將牠踏在脚下，拿出古字來嘲笑後進的青年了。」這現狀是可怡的。白話文先後經過四次魔難：林琴南的嘲笑，學衝派的攻撃，曹慕管的排斥，其勢洶洶，欲得而甘心焉；卒因南北爲白話文作防禦戰者大有其人，敵人掩旗息鼓而去。民國十三四年間，章士釗在後甲寅和白話文挑戰，臨之以萬鈞之勢，一時挺身肉搏者前仆後繼，章先生也是力竭而退。不料時勢變遷，胡適爲章士釗而開的受降城，普不見文言廢帝面縛受首；倒是白話文的主將，扶服道左，向文言古宫去投降，豈非怪事</p>
<p>昨讀獨立評論六十五期，見朱自清先生的高中畢業生國文程主一斑，言下對於青年的寫别字等等，也不勝其江河日下之槪。且謂先前「中學生國文好，是家庭的力量而非學校的力量。」說也奇怪，今日白話文的大師，都是一鼻孔出氣，「發思古之幽思」似的。從前敵人所發的不讀古書不會做白話文「白話文做得好的都是文言文做得好的」那些毒氣彈，在那時並不發生效力；現在我們營壘裏這些降將所堅的白旗上，都照樣抄在上面；林琴南地下有知，當必哈哈大笑！</p>
<p>俗話說得好：「莫長别人志氣，滅自己威風。」青年多寫别字果爲行文之大病乎？果有從莊子與文選借光之必要乎？「中華民國古國古」，因爲這樣，生在今日，還有讀三千年前古字古書的義務，還有在「用辭」時代學習「用字」古法的義務。（其在他國，埃及·巴比倫·希臘·拉西文字早劃在專門學者項下。）古老的債務太重，不獨今日青年完不清，卽古代有閒的博學之士也完不清，所以「寫别字」「讀别字」乃是我們應享的權利。漢人所謂六書，其中「轉注」「假惜」二書，就是寫别字讀别字的别解。「「强」，蚚也，從蟲，弘聲。」假作「强弱」之「强」用。（强弱之强，當用「彊」字。）「党，　党字也。」假作「朋党」之「黨」字用。（「政党」之「党，當用「攩」字。）從前人寫别字，美其名曰「假借」；難道古人假惜得，我們就假借不得？古人用詞，假惜之處便多。「流連」一詞，可作「留聯」。（琴賦）「絡繹」一詞，可作「駱驛」。（後漢書郭伋傳）「差池」一詞，可作「柴池」，（相如賦）「逡巡」一詞，可作「侵尋」。（史記）「慨慷」一詞，可作「凱康」。（神女賦）所以寫「昌明」爲「倡明」，在古人本不算什麽一回事，用浹不着劉博士大驚小怪的。朱自清先生看見「背」寫作「雁夾背」，感慨係之；若看見漢書寫及鋒」爲「及盪」，柳宗元寫「唐突」爲「盪突」，又不知作何感想？相傳「浙江乾隆丙子鄕試，兩主考，一姓莊，一性鞠。莊公顢預，而鞠公不謹；有人集杜句嘲之云：「莊夢未知何日醒，鞠花從此不須開。」尤極現成。鞠試畢回去，語陳句山太僕云：「杭人眞欠通，如休「鞠」可通「菊」？公不答。鞠詰之，公曰：「吾適思月令：鞠有黃華耳。」鞠大慙」。這回，豐之餘先生記起詩經的「倡，予和女」，又不知劉博士作何感想？</p>
<p>我以爲中國文字，艱於記憶，本身上應謀微底改革。目前治標辦法、惟有順讀别字寫别字的趨勢，養成多讀别字多寫别字的習慣；（這也可說是古法。）因爲一來，在社會上已有极柢的「簡字」，方能爲自稱讀古書的知識分子所認識；而半從音半從形的新形聲字，主有産生的可能。往者已矣，希望將來的青年，無須再還那一筆太重的債務才好！所以施先生的介紹莊子與文選，劉博士和朱自清先生的嘲笑青年寫别字，我也堅决地提出抗議。</p>
<h3>從兒童讀物說到「小學生文庫」</h3>
<p>— 心一</p>
<p>我國近今已有的兒童讀物，不論就質或就量說，實在没有一方面能使人滿意。自然，這種不良景象很難歸咎於社會的任何一方面：因爲社會上隨便那一件事業，所受外界的影響，方面很多。在今日的我國，要求一二種事業有特異的進展，根本是幻想。</p>
<p>從我個人看來，我國兒童讀物最大的短處，就在：兒童無從看起，小學校無從買起。說没有兒童讀物吧，神怪的故事或劍俠的小說倒還不少；哈哈笑或笑哈哈的詩歌也很多；正因爲這緣故，兒童不看則已，要看就是這一套；小學校不買則已，要買也就是這一些。結果，兒童多讀了，得不到什麽益處；小學校因爲節省經費，率性連兒童讀物也不買了。</p>
<p>最近在報紙上看見商務印書館的「小學生文庫」廣告，不免爲好奇心所動，去索了」份目錄。細細翻閱一下，第一集共五百册，分成四十五個門類，凡是兒童必讀的書大致具備。又，第一集所有的字數，頁數，插圖和執筆者，爲昭信實起見，都有數字表明。我覺得牠的編制能顧及我國兒童必須具有的知識和技能的各方面，是牠的最大的特點，委實是很可取法的。我相信我國出版界上，兒童讀物將因此發生一種好的轉變｜｜到少，可以陸續出版幾套新的有系統的儿童讀物；或者反已出版的兒童讀物加以嚴密的整理。</p>
<p>固然，我們評論一件事，應該從嚴；但，在荒蕪不堪的我國出版界，爲倡導起見，對於比較有些價值的工作如出版「小學生文庫」之類，不妨多多的予以鼓勵。</p>
<p>又「小學生文庫」第一集五百册目錄裏，有極小的一部分書是已經出版過的。據主編人聲明，這些書統已澈底改編。我想舊書如果是有價值的或已重加整理，讀者絕不會因其已出版過而蔑視的。</p>
<h3>午夜裏的悲劇</h3>
<p>— 黑嬰</p>
<p>這悠長的馬路全没有一點聲息，像死去了似的，一輛黃包車從拐角處馳過來</p>
<p>踏踏踏｜</p>
<p>馬蹄聲差不多，清晰的嚮着。</p>
<p>車夫在喘氣，流着汗。</p>
<p>季候已經是秋深了。安逸的人們早把棉被高高地蓋在身上，尋他們的好夢，誰去理會馬路上的車夫呢？</p>
<p>簡直是半馬的苦役呵！</p>
<p>車裏的外國水兵：</p>
<p>「麗麗啦，啦啦……」</p>
<p>酒的火力在他的胸腔裏燒，風吹不冷，他非常高興地唱着没頭没尾地唱。</p>
<p>「啦啦啦，麗……」</p>
<p>踏踏踏｜</p>
<p>車夫的脚在打拍子。</p>
<p>直拉下去，愈下愈顯得荒凉！街燈放着慘白的光，一些空車子在路旁慢慢地走着。突然前面一駕奥司汀睜大了兩隻眼珠子駛過來，喇叭也不嚮一聲，呼地一聲便不見了。</p>
<p>「喝｜」</p>
<p>外國水兵的靴尖踢在車夫的屁股上。</p>
<p>下意主識地車夫加快了脚步。</p>
<p>踏踏踏｜</p>
<p>拍子快了唱得也更起勁；聲音在靜悄的馬路上就同深山中的馬嘶。</p>
<p>…到了一座怪物般的大兵營前，車放下了呼了口深長的氣，車夫有衫袖揩着汗水。</p>
<p>「麗麗啦…」</p>
<p>水兵跳下來，挺挺胸·走了。</p>
<p>「先生，…Ｍｏｎｅｙ…」</p>
<p>車夫跟上去伸出令拌着的手。可是，外國水兵頭也不回，在大門裏不見了！</p>
<p>「你祖宗…你媽的…」</p>
<p>咒咀着，車夫没法，拉起車子又走開去。</p>
<p>没有一點聲息，悠長的馬路像死去了似的。拉着，拉了一千斤重那麽的，脚步不由地一步一步放慢下來。</p>
<h3>兩兄弟　（五）</h3>
<p>— 莫泊桑著　李維克譯</p>
<p>現在他以一種慳吝者的喜躍之情瞧着釣到的魚：隨後他抬頭望着天空·看見太陽已經偏西，說道：</p>
<p>「好罷！孩子們，我們預備回去罷？」</p>
<p>兩兄弟便把釣絲收好，把釣鈎揩乾掛在軟木塞上等候着。</p>
<p>羅蘭老爹站起來好像船長般的探望着天際說：</p>
<p>「没有風了用槳划回去罷，孩子們！」</p>
<p>他隨又突然伸開手臂指着北方說：</p>
<p>「嚇，嚇，蘇蕩甫登（Southampton英國商港）的船啦。」</p>
<p>在那像一塊藍綢一樣緊張着，浩翰，燦爛，反射着如火如金的陽光的平坦的海面，羅蘭老爹所指的地方，有一團淡黑的烟雪昇在玫瑰似的天空裏。而在這烟雲下面，我們可以瞧見那從很遠很遠的地方看去好像很小很小的船。</p>
<p>朝南望去，我們還可看見從哈佛爾堤岸附近發出的許多别的烟雲，那堤岸僅祇現出一條白線和像一隻角尖一樣筆直的燈塔。</p>
<p>羅蘭老爹問道：</p>
<p>「今天該是「諾曼底」號進口的日子罷？」</p>
<p>哲安回答：</p>
<p>「是呀，爸爸。」</p>
<p>「把望遠鏡遞給我，我猜那地方的一隻船就是牠。」</p>
<p>羅蘭老爹把望遠鏡的銅管拿長，對準他的眼睛，尋覓着視點，突然，他高興自己看到了：</p>
<p>「對啦，對啦，是牠，我認識牠那兩條烟筒。陸太太你要看看嗎？」</p>
<p>她接過望遠鏡，朝那在遠處的橫渡大西洋的郵船望去，無疑的她没有能夠對著那郵船，因爲她什麽都看不出，祇看見一片藍，加上一個顔色的圓圈，一個圓圓的虹，隨後便是一些使她作嘔的奇怪的現象，一些黑影。</p>
<p>她把望遠鏡還給羅蘭老爹說：</p>
<p>「我是從來不曉得使用這東西的。這事以前還使得我的丈夫生氣過，他是常在窗戸前面立着幾個鐘頭瞧那些輪船經過的。」</p>
<p>羅蘭老爹很覺掃興，說道：</p>
<p>「這一定是你的眼睛有什麽毛病，因爲我這望遠鏡是極好的呀！」</p>
<p>隨後他把望遠鏡遞給他的女人道：</p>
<p>「你要看看嗎？」</p>
<p>「不，謝謝。我不用看就知道我是不能看到什麽的。」</p>

<p>紐約十月二十日電告一週棉市狀况云政府貨幣政策、始以目前而定、究竟有無積極改變、說者現愈不能無疑、加以歐洲時局不定、於是本週初多方了結、致使原棉市塲處於買賣實際上較爲穏健之地位、旋以政府每磅一角借欵不久卽可實施之報告、及現棉市况漸見收緊之氣象、與夫政府方面十萬包之收買、市價乃隨之而回漲、據南方消息雖懸較高的基礎價格、終未引出内地許多棉、经、氣候利於棉産、同業中人、有謂今歲棉收或不稍遜於去年者、同時亦有逆料政府减田程序必反響而抱着觀念者、但購者愼重將事、欲待南方現貨國内疋頭市塲及内外一般大局之發展、</p>

<h3>客秈泉州消化續活</h3>
<p>昨日客秈市况　形居平軟、因市上到頭續有火車裝到、輪貨亦有續到、存底漸充、而去路福州繼續停辦、粤帮已向湘晚盯辦、浙胃與本街均呆、故上午開價卽小、繼有泉州帮趁機收買、胃口似有繼續暢辦、故市面疲而復站、但中次各　已帶小數分矣、全日開出湘南糙米七百包、價五元九角六分至五元九角、南京機米一千五百包、價六元八角八分至六元六角、又糯米四百三十包、價五元九角至五元七角半、統由泉州一帮辦去、</p>

<p>昨粉市上午開盤後、各月份大致呈穏定之象、以洋麥報價、繼續見昻、芝加哥近漲六角零、遠期一元二三角、坎拿大均漲六七角左右、故開價後、各月份市氣、似呈俏勢、不過業内外之買戸、因實銷清淡、毫無發展希望、所以交易甚小、漲度亦不過一分左右也、迨至下午開盤、以實銷帮態度仍寂、兼之近遠期月份、廠家微有套賣、並傳政府所借之美麥、有四五洋行兜攬生意、大約由洋行經手、轉於廠家、消息如是、人心當然復見平落也、結果十十一月份較前日反小五厘、十二月份大五厘、一月份小七厘半、二月份不動、三月份大五厘、</p>

<p>昨期麥市面、上下午開盤後、各月份大致呈近平遠穏之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥計續漲六七角至一元二三角不等、坎拿大漲六七角左右、故開價後人心似見平穏、不過本月份已近交割、外行多頭、均須了結、收貨者除廠家外、其餘當然不願收進、所以近期市面、遂不見定、惟二三月份、因有外行囤戸買進、市氣頗見振奮、惟從事實上言、國外之過剩、殊爲顯明、後步當少過分收回也、結果本月份較小一分、十一月份大一分、十二月份大一分、二三月份各收五分、現麥交易、依然停寂、全日祇開揚州麥二千包、價三元六角三分、由阜豐辦去、</p>

<h3>我對於全國運動會的觀察</h3>
<p>— 何文信</p>
<p>這次全國運動會熱烈的情况，我們可以從各種報紙的大幅特刋上看出來。男女田徑賽二十六項中，打破全國紀錄的竟有二十一項之多，「東方病夫」這頂帽子大槪可以抛開了吧？</p>
<p>然而事實上，這次運動良好的收獲並不能和全國民衆體格漸趨健實相提並論。第一，參加這次全運會的百分之百是學生，這就是說大多數的農工商對於運動尙不發生興趣，或者說他們還没有從事運動的機會。第二，男女田徑錦標均歸上海，内地各省喫零分者極多，所謂運動健將集中於都市，而不能普及於内地，這也是運動畸形的發展。此外如學校養運動選手做招牌，一般人對女運動員特别注意，爲爭錦標所起的鬥毆糾紛，運動選手養成不讀書的習慣等等現象的發生，更可見運動已成爲病態的，寡頭的，職業化，商品化了！與所謂「提倡體育」「强健體魄」的宗旨簡直離開有十萬八千里之遙。</p>
<p>戸外的田徑賽確是大衆業餘恢復疲勞的有益運動，但照全國運動會｜全世界也這樣｜所採取的選手制和錦標制看來、牠實在與大衆無關，僅供有閒階級男女作樂而已。嚴格的說，基於這種運動制度所産生的結果，不獨與身體無益，還與身體有害。所以，我以爲，我們應該努力使少數人掌握中的運動成爲大衆化和時代化；我們不必賭賽誰能打破全國紀錄，我們只要全國大衆都有運動的機會。</p>
<h3>厠所裏的鼾聲</h3>
<p>— 屠自安</p>
<p>徒學</p>
<p>我每天早晨五點鐘便要起身，掃地，擦桌子，給先生們打洗面水，漱口水。完了之後便到貨房裏去抬運貨物。其重量自一二百斤到三四百斤不等。還只有十四歲的我，那能做得了這樣笨重的工作？就是成人們也是不堪的。然而我們是上了套的驢子，不容你不走。貨房掌櫃是又粗又大，又有力氣，稍一遲緩，他就連打帶駡的鬧個不休。我反抗他幾次，着實吃了他幾頓巴掌。當我開着幾次抬棉紗，布綱時，我的肩胛被壓得腫起很高。最難堪的是，當木槓把肩胛壓得麻木不覺疼痛，而經過休息以後，再把木槓放上肩的滋味，簡直就和未痊愈的瘡口再受重創的一樣，有很多的學徒壓得吐血。有一次，我的腰因扛紅糖包被扭傷了，一直躺了七八天才好，在這七八天裏，一點也動彈不得，連咳嗽都不可能。在這樣痛苦中，不但没有人來安慰我，而且貨房掌櫃還說我裝假偷懶呢！</p>
<p>每天工作時間普通總在十六小時以上，有時甚至增加到十八小時，每天總是從早晨五點鐘起開始工作，一直做到晚上十二點鐘睡覺。我們在兒童時期，睡眠正應當特别的充足，像這樣一天僅有五六小時的睡眠，又那能支持得住？所以我們往往正在站着做工的時候，就睡着了。夏天夜裏，臭虫蚊虫雖多，却是分毫不覺得咬、頭一着枕便呼呼入睡了。還有一件最可笑而說來又最傷心的事，在一個夏天的晚上，我到厠所去拉屎，見有另一個學街已先在裏邊，我便退了出來，後來我等了好久還不見他出來，待我進去一看，原來他却在裏面好夢正酣，呼呼濃睡呢！你想，他若不困倦到極點，怎能不避臭穢的睡在茅房裏呢？</p>
<p>還有一件，我所要鄭重說的，就是，商店裏的大掌櫃常常把一些臉孔白凈漂亮的學徒拿支凃他的玩物，這樣的事情，差不多每一個商店總是有的。</p>
<p>有一次，我編了一段這樣的歌曲駡他們：「大掌櫃是朝廷，二掌櫃是正宫，西宫愛妃ＸＸＸ，還有ＸＸＸ是老宫，（太監）。」這歌傳到掌櫃耳朶裏，立時便把我開除了。後來，經我父親一頓嚴重的處罰，託了很多人的面子去說情，掌櫃總算是又把我收留了。</p>
<p>每逢下過雨，我就得拉着車子往街上送貨，在泥水裏走着。最危險的是，負着糧袋上五六丈高的跳板，吊下來跌死是常常有的。每逢冬天，天氣太冷了，我的手脚和臉兒便全部凍腫，而且還開了很大的裂痕。</p>
<p>在吃飯的時候，我的兩只眼睛眞像賊眼一樣，四面八方都要顧到。如果掌櫃們一碗飯吃完了，便要立刻起來給他們盛飯，稍不留意，即以白眼相向。一桌八人，輪流下去，自己是連吃飯的工夫都没有。小菜只有在自己這一面的可吃，若向掌櫃面前伸一筷，掌櫃的便要憤然地將一碗菜投在我面前。有時說一句怨語，被掌櫃聽見了，一頓申斥是難免的：「要享福回家享去，這裏不是養老院。嫌不好，趕快滚，要别的没事，要兩腿的人，多着呢！」</p>

<h3>如何組織「業餘劇團」</h3>
<p>— 陳美瓊女士</p>
<p>在上一期的業餘周刋裏，我們看到林平凡君「組織業餘劇團的建議」的一篇文章。林君明顯地，簡要地，提出組織「業餘劇團」的三個要義：</p>
<p>（一）使新興戲劇與店員工友發生關係</p>
<p>（二）使大衆認識戲劇，使戲劇建立永久的基礎。</p>
<p>（三）使有藝術興趣的店員，工友，有參加戲劇運動的機會。</p>
<p>我是一個女店員，我們是精神物質兩種營養最缺乏的一羣。我們需要新興藝術來滋補我們，領導我們，跟着時代的進展而進展。因此，「業餘劇團」（以及同等意義的一切集團），無疑地是目下我們所最需要的。在林君的「建議」中，它已說明了這種組織的必需，但它還没有說明怎樣組織。抽角的「呐喊」之後、我們必須要來一個「具體」的設計。</p>
<p>經騐告訴我們，一件生疏的工作最困難的是它的開始，尤其是在「職業青年」素無組織的環境下，但困難不過是困難而已，困難是可以用努力來打破的</p>
<p>首先，我願自告奮勇，召集一般願加入的「職業青年」，組織「業餘劇團籌備會」，開始初步的努力：</p>

<h3>Funing Has Been Reported Recovered; Security Forces Advance on Multiple Routes; County Magistrate Liu Xingpei to Return to Office Immediately; Zhao Lei's Troops Request Takeover of Defense of Lulong City</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Funing was recaptured by our security forces on the evening of the 21st. There were no traces of bandits west of Funing; they all fled east of Funing. Wu Quanrong, the director of the Funing Public Security Bureau, returned to office on the afternoon of the 21st to prepare for the takeover. County Magistrate Liu Xingpei, who was in Beiping negotiating post-disaster matters and relief efforts with Chairman Yu, has changed his plans and will come to Tianjin on the 22nd and return to the county that evening or on the 23rd. Funing County fell on the 24th of last month. Until the 21st of this month, it has been a total of 27 days. The suffering of the people is beyond description. The temporary office of the Funing County Government, established in Tianjin, has been reported to the provincial government for cancellation as of the 21st. (Central News Agency dispatch, 21st)</p>
<h3>Changli</h3>
<p>The reporter, accompanying the head of the Zao Zongdui riding team, inspected villages along the eastern line. Refugees were returning one after another along the way. At 1:00 PM, they reached Jun Guanying, more than 30 li east of Changli, which is already within Funing territory. It is only 10 li from Funing City, and about 7 li from Suo Jingshan. There are no bandit traces on the south bank of the Yang River. The bandits are gathering at Suo Jingshan, attempting to defend Funing City by force. Our foremost troops have reached Huangjinshan, only 2 li from Suo Jingshan and less than 6 li from Funing City. From here, Funing City and Suo Jingshan are clearly visible, and there are occasional sounds of gunfire coming from that direction. The reporter plans to return to Changli on the 22nd. It is reported that Zhao Lei's troops suddenly advanced on Lulong and requested to take over the defense of the city. Dou's troops, not having received clear orders, have urgently telegraphed for instructions to prevent misunderstandings. (Special dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The eastern Hebei suppression and security forces, acting on orders, are advancing on multiple routes to eliminate the source of the bandits. Yu Xuezhong has ordered the Bandit Suppression Commander-in-Chief Zhang Xixian to reach the predetermined line within a set time to launch a general offensive. Funing County will be recovered within days. (Special dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Dou Xizhe, the commander of our security force, led his troops across the Yang River today, pressing towards Shen He Bao and Qiaofu Shan in Funing. There were battles this morning. The bandit forces in that area are led by Liu Yucheng, mostly cavalry, and equipped with machine guns. The Funing bandits, led by Qi Wenping, Hu Pingtian, and Song Ziwen, have two direct-fire guns and four mortars. The various bandit units, now surrounded, are preparing to flee in two directions. One route is planned to escape to Jieling, but Japanese troops have blocked that direction. The other route is planned to escape westwards, posing a significant strain on Lulong. Liu Xingpei, the magistrate of Funing County, has been ordered to first go to Liushouying, and this afternoon will go to Tianjin to seek instructions from Wei Jian, the director of the Civil Affairs Department, before proceeding to Funing. The director of the county public security bureau and others have arrived at Liushouying awaiting orders. (Special dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Chinese Security Forces attacked the bandit army of Zhang Kuiyuan at dawn yesterday. The bandits, realizing their unfavorable situation, abandoned Funing and retreated northwest. The Security Forces occupied Funing this morning. The troops stationed at Jianchangying have moved to Yanhegong to monitor the bandits' movements and prevent them from invading Manchuria. Furthermore, 1,000 Chinese Security Forces advanced towards Qian'an this morning to suppress the bandit army. (Japanese Allied News Agency dispatch, 21st)</p>
<h3>Receiving Xinglong is Difficult; The County is the Richest in Hebei</h3>
<p>(Beiping) According to people from Xinglong, the county is now completely occupied by a puppet organization. County Magistrate Wang Zhenhai was appointed by the puppet regime. Currently, they are building a long-distance bus route directly to Rehe. A railway is also planned. The puppet regime is also planning to expand the county's jurisdiction east to Xifengkou and north to Gubeikou. The reception of the county will not be easily achieved. The county is quite wealthy, with the densest forests in Hebei. It has mineral resources such as gold, coal, gemstones, and crystals, all of which have been exploited by the Japanese and puppet regime. (Central News Agency dispatch, 21st)</p>
<h3>Moving Sun Dianying's Troops Encounters Many Difficulties</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Sun Dianying's representative, Hu Jiesan, was summoned by Sun and is scheduled to go to Baotou on the 20th. Wang intends to transfer Sun's troops to Xinjiang, but there are many practical difficulties, making it difficult to realize. He has also sent a telegram to the Central Government, requesting instructions on how to proceed. (Special dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding the westward movement of Sun Dianying's troops, the Central Government has not yet sent instructions. The authorities here have telegraphed the Central Government requesting instructions on everything. (Special dispatch, 21st)</p>
<h3>It is Said that Ji Hongchang Secretly Went to Tai'an</h3>
<p>(Beiping) It is widely rumored that Ji Hongchang secretly went to Tai'an on the morning of the 21st to meet with Feng, and some contact was made. (Special dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Fang Zhenwu went missing en route from Fengjiaying to Sun Hezhen. There are many rumors circulating about this. It is said that the authorities in Tianjin have been ordered to pay attention to investigating Fang's whereabouts, but there has been no news. The remaining troops of Fang and Ji have been disbanded. Huang Shiyue, the third section chief of the Military Affairs Commission, has submitted a report on the conclusion of the matter to He Yingqin. (Special dispatch, 21st)</p>
<h3>He Yingqin Sent Personnel to Miyun to Meet with Saeda</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Saeda, the commander of the Japanese army in Miyun, previously received orders from the Japanese Kwantung Army to go to the Shulan Mountains to intercept the remaining troops of Fang and Ji. Now that the incident has been resolved, Commander Saeda has returned to Miyun, and his troops are gradually withdrawing to Chengde. He has sent Zhu Shiqin to Miyun to meet with Saeda. (Special dispatch, 21st)</p>
<h3>Zou Zuohua Went to the Pinghan Line for Inspection</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Zou Zuohua went to Zhuozhou and Liangxiang along the Pinghan Line this morning to inspect the stationed artillery troops. He is scheduled to return to Beiping on the 23rd and then inspect the garrison troops in the suburbs. (Special dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Qian Dajun previously went to southern Hebei and northern Henan with various special commissioners to inspect the garrison troops. Having completed the task, he has come to Beiping today to meet with He Yingqin and report on the situation of the military inspections in various places. (Special dispatch, 21st)</p>
<h3>He and Huang Plan to Request the Government to Grant Feng a Suitable Title</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Feng Yuxiang, who resides in Mount Tai, spends approximately 10,000 yuan each month, all of which is provided by the Shandong Provincial Government. This year, Shandong Province has experienced severe flooding, resulting in a sharp decline in revenue. Shandong can no longer bear this huge expense. He, Huang, Song, and others have consulted repeatedly on the matter. This morning, Han met with He and Huang to determine two solutions to Feng's living expenses: (1) The government should announce a title for Feng, such as National Water Conservancy Superintendent or Army Inspection Envoy; (2) Reduce his monthly allowance. Because Feng still has a guard of over 1,000 men, now that Feng has retired, there is no need to support such a large number of guards. Measures should be taken to resettle them to reduce the burden. He and Huang plan to jointly send a telegram to Chiang and Wang, requesting the speedy announcement of a title to maintain Feng's livelihood. The telegram will be sent within days. Gan visited Song again this morning to discuss all of Feng's problems. (Special dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Beiping Chamber of Commerce will host a banquet tonight for Han, Yu, Song, Xu, and other military and political figures. Han and Yu are scheduled to leave Beiping tonight and return to Jinan and Tianjin, respectively. (Special dispatch, 21st)</p>
<h3>Hebei Finance Director Goes to Beijing to Discuss North China Military and Administrative Expenses</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Hebei Province's payment to the Beiping Political Reorganization Committee has been ordered to be transferred to the Central Government. However, the military and administrative expenses of North China have always been collected by Hebei Province from the Central Government's tax revenue. How to provide subsidies in the future remains to be negotiated. Lu Shuiting, the director of the Hebei Finance Department, is going to Beijing on the 11th to seek instructions from the Ministry of Finance. (Special dispatch, 21st)</p>
<h3>Tao Shangming Plans to Resign as Supervisory Commissioner</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Tao Shangming recently held a meeting with Japanese military officer Shibayama to discuss methods for suppressing bandits in eastern Hebei. The meeting was very successful. Tao originally planned to submit a request to establish the Supervisory Commissioner's Office immediately to assist the county governments in the war zone in handling post-disaster affairs. However, due to the many thorny issues in the war zone, he intends to immediately request the authorities to resign from the position of Supervisory Commissioner. (Special dispatch, 21st)</p>
<h3>Chahar Province Sends Troops to Suppress the Rebel Troops of Zheng Guilin. Tang Yulin's Troops Will Be Incorporated by Song. Liu Guilin Appointed Commander of Bandit Suppression in Eastern Chahar, and the Seal of Office Has Been Issued</h3>
<p>(Beiping) It was previously reported that several thousand of Tang's troops were found in Yidaoguan. According to investigation, they are the rebel troops of Zheng Guilin. The number is not as high as several thousand, but only five or six hundred cavalry. These troops came from eastern Chahar, attempting to echo with the troops of Fang and Ji. Unexpectedly, Fang and Ji had already left when they arrived at Yidaoguan, and the remaining troops had already been disarmed here. These five or six hundred cavalry are currently being suppressed by troops sent by Chahar Province and will soon be resolved, not becoming a problem. When the rebel troops fled to Yidaoguan, a certain county magistrate led the militia to resist and was killed by the rebel troops. (Special dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>(Beiping) In the Dushikou area, there are still seventy or eighty of Tang's troops. The handling of their aftermath has been assigned to Song Zheyuan to send personnel to incorporate them. Liu Guidang recently expressed that he is very agreeable and has no issues. Tang himself will be given the title of Bandit Suppression Commander in a certain area. As for Liu Guidang, he has recently expressed being very agreeable and without any issues. Bandit suppression is currently being actively carried out in Zhangbei. (Special dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Liu Guidang's Chief of Staff, Chu Yingqiao, went to Beiping. Yesterday afternoon, he visited He and reported that Liu had become enlightened and decided to obey the Central Government. He Yingqin handed over to Chu the appointment letter and seal of office issued by the Central Government, appointing Liu as the Commander of Bandit Suppression in Eastern Chahar. It was stipulated that Liu's troops would be organized into four regiments, and the Military Affairs Commission would allocate 20,000 yuan per month. After Chu received the appointment letter, seal of office, and 6,000 yuan for the first ten days' expenses, he immediately left and is scheduled to return to Chicheng on the 12th to report to Liu and receive further orders. He also sent Sun Guanxiang, the quartermaster of the troops, to Tianjin to purchase uniforms for the troops. (Special dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>(Beiping) He Yingqin sent Zhu Shiqin from the First Department of the Military Affairs Commission to Miyun and Shunyi to investigate the situation of the refugees in order to provide relief. (Special dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Wang Shuchang, because the military police stationed at the various city gates have captured many defeated soldiers from Fang and Ji's remaining troops in recent days, fearing that they would disturb the local area, visited He this afternoon to ask for instructions on how to deal with them.

<h3>Li Ze First Arrived in Nagasaki</h3>
<p>Nagasaki: Li Ze, sent by Huang Fu to resolve the Sino-Japanese pending issues through side-channel movements, arrived in Nagasaki on the Nagasaki Maru at 7:00 PM yesterday. He told reporters who visited him on the ship that the purpose of his visit to Japan was not based on instructions from the Nanjing government but was a private matter. He plans to stay for a month, during which time he may have the opportunity to meet with government officials. In his personal opinion, the opening of Sino-Japanese relations will still take some time, but the anti-Japanese atmosphere in China seems to have eased slightly. (Den Tsū dispatch, 21st)</p>
<h3>Opinions Among Mongol Princes in Xilingol Are Highly Divided; Bawen Jun Said Autonomy Has No Background</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The issue of Inner Mongolian autonomy is mostly being convened by Prince De, but the princes all have their own opinions. The two leagues of Xilingol and Zhalaimu are outdated in their views but still tend towards a final resolution by the Central Government. After the Bailingmiao meeting, Prince De continued to run around and try to win people over. Due to disagreements, there have been no concrete results. However, Prince De is still actively campaigning. In recent years, the thinking of Inner Mongolian youths has become quite leftist. Some are fascinated by the issue of autonomy, but their views differ from those of Prince De. The youths plan to emulate Ireland in England and carry out a national autonomous movement. It is also difficult to cooperate with Prince De. Prince De is now in a difficult situation due to his isolation and inability to mobilize people. If Huang Shaoxiong, Zhao Pilian, and others can come north and carefully assess the situation and prudently handle it, it may not be difficult to reverse the situation. (Special dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Mongolian-Tibetan Committee received a telegram from the Guisui investigation commissioner stating that on the 28th, the various leagues, upon hearing that the Central Government would send senior officials to Mongolia to propagate, held a meeting on the 9th of this month. Prince De also stated that the livelihood of the Mongolian people should be improved, but they should not leave the Central Government and must be consistent with the local government to avoid being used by foreigners. After receiving the report, the committee has forwarded it to the Central Government for review. (Special dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>Guisui: Bawen Jun returned from a consolation visit to the Yikezhao League on the 20th and said that Prince De advocated Inner Mongolian autonomy to unite the remaining uninjured leagues and banners of Xilingol and Yikezhao in order to strengthen national border defense and had no other purpose or background. I have traveled throughout the leagues and banners and know that this autonomous action is neither independence nor surrender to the enemy. Objectively speaking, the state has never actively built up the Mongolian banners. In the future, it should be implemented in earnest so that the Mongolian banners can benefit. For the current autonomy issue, it should be properly guided and put on the right track. Otherwise, improper measures will have important implications for national defense. Bawen then showed the various leagues and banners presented to the Central Government, requesting the formation of an Inner Mongolian autonomous government to implement autonomy in order to save the crisis and strengthen national defense. The presentation first described the glory of Genghis Khan's conquest of Europe and Asia and the current crisis in Inner Mongolia. Failing to follow Dr. Sun Yat-sen’s instructions on political tutelage and the provisional constitution, the presentation requested permission to organize an autonomous government, improve the administration of Inner Mongolia, and seek the balanced development of education, economy, military, transportation, industry, and all other undertakings in order to save the border from crisis and avoid the recurrence of Outer Mongolia and Eastern Mongolia. (Central News Agency dispatch, 21st)</p>
<h3>Children of Banner Descent Cannot Find Employment After Leaving the Pass; The Puppet Cannot Find Them Positions</h3>
<p>(Beiping) A few days ago, more than 40 children of banner descent went to Changchun to visit Puyi in hopes of finding a personal way out. They secretly left Beiping one after another. After arriving in Changchun, Puyi only asked his clansman Puyi Kuang to relay to everyone that the puppet state's finances had a fixed budget and could not add redundant staff and was unable to accommodate them and requested that they immediately return to Beiping. The children of the banners were unable to get what they wanted. After the Mid-Autumn Festival, they returned to Beiping one after another. It is said that the annual budget of the puppet regime's executive government is 1 million yuan, which is just over 80,000 yuan per month. At present, the actual monthly expenditure of the puppet regime is more than 60,000 yuan, and the remaining 20,000 yuan belongs to Puyi personally. Puyi puts all 20,000 yuan into savings in the bank as living expenses after being driven out in the future. Changchun is now undertaking large-scale construction, and the total construction cost of the palace is 10 million yuan. Ordinary traitors, such as Zheng Xiaoxu, are promoting it as Puyi's construction. Someone asked Puyi, and Puyi shook his head and did not speak, because he deeply believed that the Japanese would never build it for his personal use. (Special dispatch, 21st)</p>
<h3>There Will Be Changes to the Mongolian-Tibetan Committee System</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) In addition to the chairman and vice-chairman, the current system of the Mongolian-Tibetan Committee also has five standing committee members. Some committee members suggested abolishing the chairman and vice-chairman system. Shi Qingyang suggested abolishing the standing committee member system. The Central Political Conference decided to change the organizational principles of the Mongolian-Tibetan Committee. Both suggestions were not adopted. According to the opinion of the Executive Yuan with reference to various parties, the Mongolian Committee will be merged with the Border Affairs Group of the General Staff Headquarters to form a Ministry of Border Affairs, which will be directly under the Executive Yuan. The organization will still imitate the various ministries, with a minister, a political vice minister, and a standing vice minister. There will be five departments under it, including a general affairs department and departments for Mongolia, Tibet, Hui, and Manchuria. There will also be counselors, secretaries, and translation offices. After the senior officials inspecting Inner Mongolia return to Beijing, revisions will be made and sent to the Legislative Yuan for review. (Special dispatch, 21st)</p>
<h3>Chairman Lin Takes the Yong Sui Warship to Fujian; Will Return to Beijing in Two or Three Weeks</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) National Government Chairman Lin took the Yong Sui warship to Fujian from Beijing at 6:30 PM on the 21st. Lin had previously hand-delivered instructions to the Navy Department to dispatch a warship. The Yong Sui warship had been preparing to depart since 4:00 PM. At 6:00 PM, Navy Vice Minister Li Shijia personally went to Chairman Lin's residence to greet him. He then took a car to the Xiaguan Naval Wharf to board the ship. Along the riverbank, military police were on strict alert. When Chairman Lin boarded the ship, the military police all raised their guns in salute. The Yong Sui warship fired more than a dozen salutes to show respect. Those who went to Xiaguan to see him off included National Government Civil Affairs Chief Wei Huai, Military Affairs Chief Lu Chao, Document Bureau Chief Xu Jingzhi, Secretary-General Gao Lingbai, Zhu Wenzhong, Section Chief Xiao Qin, and dozens of representatives from various departments and commissions. According to a Central News Agency reporter, Chairman Lin's trip to Fujian is a quick return to his hometown to sweep the tombs. He will return to Beijing in two or three weeks. (Central News Agency dispatch, 21st)</p>
<h3>The Executive Yuan is Not Responsible for the Allocation of Cotton and Wheat Loans</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Executive Yuan has received no fewer than one hundred requests from various parties for the allocation of US cotton loans, with the amount requested exceeding 100 million yuan. However, this loan should be allocated by the Economic Committee. An order has been issued to all agencies across the country that any future requests for US cotton and wheat loans should be submitted to the Economic Committee. The Executive Yuan is not responsible. (Special dispatch, 21st)</p>

<h3>Reading Xilingol's Request for Autonomy</h3>
<p>– Zi</p>
<p>Xilingol League Vice-Leader Prince De et al. request permission for a high degree of autonomy (September 14th). The telegram to the government was published in a non-formal manner the other day. We read it over and over again and found it impossible to find the real reason for this autonomy movement. The first paragraph of the telegram uses over 400 words to describe the origins of the autonomy movement. On close reading, they are all the usual phrases used by domestic military personnel in their telegrams over the past 20 years. It says that Outer Mongolia was seized by Russia, Eastern Mongolia fell to Japan, and Xilingol is being pulled in a way that hangs by a thread. Then, the appropriate conclusion should be that Xilingol urgently needs to cooperate closely with the Central Government in order to protect itself. But it does not say this. Instead, it says, "The authorities do not have time to save themselves. How can we Mongols bear to ask the Central Government for assistance?" and "The weak Mongol territories, affected by the storm, will gradually be eaten away, causing deep concern to the Central Government. If the fence breaks down, the Mongols will lose their lives, and their compatriots will be implicated... What other method is there besides self-determination and autonomy?" Can these logically inconsistent and far-fetched statements be used as the theoretical basis for an autonomy movement? What can be emphasized in the telegram is that it reports that the Bailingmiao meeting on July 26th resolved to adopt a high degree of autonomy and establish the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government to describe all foreign measures. Only the Central Government is followed, and it is hoped that the authorities will make up for its shortcomings and teach it what it does not understand. This is sufficient to indicate the form and nature of the Xilingol autonomy movement.</p>
<p>After reading the telegrams from Demchugdongrub and others, we can understand that the situation in Xilingol is still at a time when it is easy to reverse. Whether the reversal can be successful depends only on how the authorities respond. Not only does the fact that the number of attendees at the second Bailingmiao meeting on the 9th of this month suffice as proof, but it can also be discerned from the wording of the telegram. Today, the authorities are able to urgently use the method of curing the disease, and the few powerful elements of the Mongolian youth who are thinking of trouble can be restrained from launching. At the same time, the fundamental strategy should be carried out. From the political aspect, consolidating the inward-looking heart of Xilingol can prevent Japan from manipulating the autonomy of Xilingol.</p>
<p>Huang Shaoxiong and Zhao Pilian were dispatched to inspect Xilingol, and the mission they bear is very important. However, after the two were dispatched, they have not yet gone north. Are they ignorant of the urgency of the situation and unaware of Japan's rapidly proceeding conspiracies? Or are they afraid of the difficulties ahead and watching and hesitating? It is important to know that things are done by people, and speed is valued in action. In the past, Outer Mongolia was manipulated by Imperial Russia and became independent after the first year. However, in June of the eighth year, Xu Shuzheng suddenly arrived in Kulun and used swift means to make it announce the cancellation of autonomy for a time. If there had been no domestic radical political strife, Outer Mongolia might not be in its current state today. Huang and Zhao are already packed, and the central government's policy toward Xilingol has also been passed at the Executive Yuan meeting on the 17th. Therefore, we will describe Xu Shuzheng's struggle to urge Huang and Zhao to act quickly and hope that the two can use their skills to reverse the situation in Xilingol in order to curb the westward advance of Japanese forces.</p>
<h3>Eight-Province Grain Conference; Remarks of the Hunan Representatives</h3>
<p>(Nanchang) Zhang, Director of the Finance Department of Hunan Province, and Yu, Director of the Construction Department of Hunan Province, said at the Eight-Province Grain Conference that the agricultural output in various parts of our country is originally inconsistent. The areas that lack it must rely on the surplus areas. The local people are afraid of famine and ban the export of rice, so that the provinces cannot circulate with each other. Chairman Chiang has sought remedies and convened the rice-producing areas to hold a meeting to discuss relief methods. Chairman He has also prepared a proposal for the meeting to decide. In the future, it is planned to organize grain management bureaus in various provinces and conduct accurate investigations into the size of the population of each province and the amount of grain production and sales. The surplus will be exported, and the areas that are insufficient will designate locations to purchase and transport them. He also requested that the Central Government allocate huge sums of money from the cotton and wheat loans for the purchase and storage of grain in areas with surplus grain for sale in famine years. Foreign rice is imported by air. (Central News Agency dispatch, 21st)</p>
<h3>Yu Youren Arrives in Lintong</h3>
<p>(Xi'an) Yu Youren arrived in Lintong on the 20th. Shao Lizi, Yang Hucheng, his wife, and the provincial supervisory committee all went to greet him. They stayed overnight. It was originally scheduled to come to the province on the morning of the 21st, but it rained on the morning of the 21st, so it may be postponed. According to Yu, he told reporters in Lintong that he came to visit his wife's ancestral grave and inspect the disaster-stricken hometown and the preparations for the agricultural college. He will stay for about two weeks. (Central News Agency dispatch, 21st)</p>
<h3>Jiangsu and Shandong Discuss Repairing the Dikes</h3>
<p>(Jinan) The Jiangsu Provincial Government sent a telegram to the Shandong Provincial Government requesting that the Zhaoyang Lake dikes be repaired. The Provincial Government ordered the Construction Department to investigate. The Construction Department has replied that if the twelve culverts are repaired, there will be no place for the water to discharge, and more than a dozen counties in southwestern Shandong, including Jinning and Fengpei, will inevitably suffer. Jiangsu should first dredge the Liutang River, a flood discharge channel in the upper reaches. If Jiangsu and Shandong separately stipulate the amount of water to be written, then Jiangsu and Shandong will both be safe. (21st)</p>

<h3>Japan's Policy Outline Determined; Extraordinary Cabinet Meeting Passes Resolutions of the Five-Minister Conference; Simultaneously Pursuing Diplomacy and Enhancing Military Strength; Hirota's Policy of Adjusting Diplomatic Relations</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) It took five meetings of the Five-Minister Conference to reach a consensus on the Outline of Fundamental National Policy, marking the end of one stage. Therefore, an extraordinary Cabinet meeting was held at the Prime Minister's official residence at 10:00 AM on the 21st. All Cabinet members attended. Prime Minister Saito first reported that the government, in view of the severity of the current international relations of the empire, felt it was necessary to determine the fundamental attitude to cope with the situation. Ministers with direct relations to foreign policy and national interests repeatedly deliberated and exchanged views. As a result, a consensus was reached on the Outline of Fundamental National Policy regarding national defense. As for general domestic policy issues related to national defense, relevant Cabinet members will conduct consultations. Next, Foreign Minister Hirota reported on the matters decided at the Five-Minister Conference. The Minister of Finance, the Minister of the Army, and the Minister of the Navy successively supplemented the explanations. After some questions from other cabinet members, everyone unanimously approved the matters decided at the Five-Minister Conference. (Japanese Allied News Agency dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After the extraordinary Cabinet meeting today approved the matters decided at the Five-Minister Conference, it was resolved as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Japan's international relations are aimed at world peace, and Japan's policy will be implemented through diplomatic means.</p>
<p>(2) The goal of national defense is to be immune from threats and foreign insults from other countries, and attention should be paid to harmonizing Japan's national strength.</p>
<p>This resolution clarifies the government's policy principles and the direction of the people. Therefore, the government has decided not to issue any other statements. (Japanese Allied News Agency dispatch, 21st)</p>
<h3>Contents of Hirota's Policy</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The specific issues of the foreign policy, national defense, and other policies decided by the Five-Minister Conference have not been agreed upon by the various ministries, and it has been decided that the administrative bureaus of the various ministries will continue to negotiate in the future. However, the outline has been decided in advance as the fundamental coping strategy of the current cabinet for the current situation. At the extraordinary cabinet meeting on the 21st, Foreign Minister Hirota will verbally report the matters decided by the Five-Minister Conference. The contents are as follows:</p>
<h3>Basic Requirements</h3>
<p>After the Manchurian Incident, the Japanese government withdrew from the League of Nations, and its foreign relations have become tense. Furthermore, the breakdown of the World Economic Conference has intensified the confrontation of world economic imperialism. Recently, Germany's withdrawal from the League of Nations and the Disarmament Conference has made the current objective situation even more dangerous. Japan, under these circumstances, had no choice but to realize the extreme seriousness of its relations with China, Russia, and the United States. The current cabinet, deeply aware of the need to establish a full domestic and foreign policy, has decided to establish a strategy to cope with both war and peace by enriching diplomacy and military preparations.</p>
<h3>Policy Towards the United States</h3>
<p>Japan, in view of the position of the United Kingdom in the Far East and the naval disarmament issue at the Second Washington Conference in 1935, must devote its greatest efforts to the harmony of US-Japan relations. That is, Japan's policy towards the United States is to clear up all past relations between the two countries diplomatically and to establish the principle of maintaining equal strength with the United States militarily. This is the policy to stabilize Japan's position in the Far East.</p>
<h3>Policies Towards Russia</h3>
<p>The Soviet Russian Federation has consistently pursued its revolutionary diplomacy. With the world's most powerful military equipment, it constantly threatens "Manchukuo," Japan's mutual defense ally. Therefore, Japan must prepare sufficient army equipment, maintain a calm and observant posture externally, and simultaneously resolve pending issues between the two countries to adjust their diplomatic relations.</p>
<h3>Policies Towards China</h3>
<p>Sino-Japanese relations, which had deteriorated drastically since the Manchurian Incident, have gradually eased since the establishment of the North China Truce Agreement. However, concrete evidence of China changing its policies towards Japan has not yet materialized, so optimism is not warranted. Future policies towards China should aim to improve the friendly relations between the two countries. This policy of friendship can only be achieved with the full implementation of policies towards the United States and Russia.</p>
<h3>Policies Towards the United Kingdom</h3>
<p>Anglo-Japanese relations have become increasingly strained due to the deepening global economic recession and the escalating competition in the global market. However, British foreign policy in the Far East traditionally adopts a dualistic approach, balancing the power of Japan and the United States. Therefore, Japan should utilize the power of the United States in the Far East.</p>
<h3>Other Policies</h3>
<p>Japan maintains friendly relations with European countries such as France, Germany, and Belgium. It is also continuously engaging in political efforts in India, South Africa, and Central and South America, which are important markets for the Japanese economy, to expand its economic influence. (United Press Dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Initially, during the Five Ministers Conference, there was considerable disagreement among the Minister of the Army and the Ministers of Finance and Foreign Affairs regarding the current situation and national defense. This repeatedly led to talk of a crisis. However, after exchanging arguments, the views of the five ministers gradually converged. On the 20th, they reached complete agreement, and it was officially decided at the cabinet meeting on the 21st. The political crisis has thus come to an end. The focus moving forward is on how to establish domestic policies. However, the government is now optimistic that the so-called political instability has disappeared.

<h3>French Investment in Manchuria via Japanese Telegraph</h3>
<p>To Be Signed Soon in Dalian</p>
<p>(Changchun) The joint investment plan in Manchuria by the French Economic Development Association and the South Manchuria Railway (Mantetsu), mediated by Mr. Deriviere, a representative of the French Economic Development Association, was decided upon at the Mantetsu board meeting on the 13th. Mantetsu and Mr. Deriviere will sign the agreement in Dalian on the 25th or 26th. The original proposal has been transferred to the headquarters of the French Economic Development Association and the Tokyo Japan-France Association's Manchurian Investment Investigation Committee for formal decision. The amount of investment has not yet been decided, but it will be either 1 billion or 2 billion francs. The French side hopes to divide it into three phases, totaling 3 billion francs. (Dentsu Dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>(Dalian) The details of the concrete plan for the investment in Manchuria by Mr. Tripier, the representative of the French Economic Development Association, and Mantetsu, which is soon to be signed, are as follows: (1) France will establish the Franco-Japanese Manchurian Enterprise Company for investment in Manchuria. (2) The company will have 12 employees, half from France and half from Japan. (3) All French investment in Manchuria will be handled by this company, investing in civil engineering, public welfare, finance, other business sectors, and business companies. Furthermore, Vice President Hatta of Mantetsu said regarding French investment in "Manchukuo" that the opinions of both Japan and France are in complete agreement, and all parties concerned are in favor. Therefore, it will be approved soon. However, the purpose of the investment and the amount of investment have not yet been decided. (Dentsu Dispatch, 21st)</p>
<h3>Japanese Hurricane Disaster; Over Four Hundred Sailors Missing; Two British Women Aboard "Yashima Maru" Die</h3>
<p>Matsuyama: Ten engine-powered ships from Higashi-Sotoumi Village, twenty ships from Nishi-Sotoumi Village, and ten ships from Utsumi Village in Minami-Uwa District, Ehime Prefecture, with a total of approximately two thousand sailors, set sail for Kogurishima Island near Kochi Prefecture at 5:00 PM on the 19th. On the morning of the 20th, they suddenly encountered a strong storm. As of 5:00 PM on the same day, three hundred and seventy-nine sailors were missing, and the rest took refuge on Kogurishima Island, Kochi Prefecture. (Dentsu Dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>Kochi: The coast of Tosa was hit by a hurricane on the 19th, causing severe damage. In the western region, out of the two hundred fishermen who had set sail since the 19th, seventy took refuge on nearby coasts, and the remaining one hundred are missing, their fate uncertain. (Dentsu Dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Yashima Maru, which sank in a hurricane near Kobe yesterday, had among its passengers an officer of the British aircraft carrier Eagle, Mr. Burifost, and Mrs. Barry, both of whom died. The two women came to Japan to meet their husbands and were returning to Kobe from Beppu to board the ship for Hong Kong to await the Eagle's return from Japan. Initially, it was thought that only one of the women had drowned. Mr. Burifost's wife, only about twenty years old, was found washed ashore. Mrs. Barry, who was in her middle age, died after being rescued due to prolonged immersion in the water. Only nine bodies have been recovered so far, and fifty-nine people are still missing, most of whom are feared dead. A British passenger in third class, named Salma, was initially reported to have been rescued and landed ashore, but then disappeared. His whereabouts are still unknown. After the Yashima Maru encountered the disaster, two nearby ships heard the call for help and rushed to assist, but they could not reach the scene in time due to the fierce hurricane. The ship was carrying about ten people, with sailors accounting for eighteen of them. (Reuters Dispatch, 21st)</p>

<p>Amidst Tensions in Japanese-Russian Relations</p>
<h3>Litvinov to Visit White House for Negotiations on U.S.-Soviet Resumption of Relations; Roosevelt and Kalinin Exchanging Letters and Telegrams; Attempting to Resolve Sixteen-Year Pending Issue in One Fell Swoop; U.S. Recognition of Soviet Russia Imminent, Offering a Sobering Dose to Far East Crisis</h3>
<p>(Washington) U.S. President Roosevelt and Soviet Russian Foreign Commissar Litvinov will meet in the tranquil atmosphere of the White House to seek a common understanding on the issues that led to the severance of U.S.-Soviet relations on November 7, 1917.</p>
<p>According to a White House announcement today, the U.S. President and Soviet Russian Central Executive Committee Chairman Kalinin have exchanged letters and telegrams, agreeing that the current situation between the two countries should be brought to an end as soon as possible. The U.S. President's letter, sent on October 10th, stated, "It is most regrettable that our two countries have not yet exchanged diplomatic representatives. Since taking office, I have sought to end this situation." It went on to point out that while the issues affecting relations between the two countries are serious, they are not insurmountable. He added that if Kalinin shared this sentiment, he would be happy to receive a representative from his office to study the pending issues, with the understanding that this discussion would not bind either country's future actions. Kalinin replied on October 17th, stating that he fully agreed with the U.S. President's views and would send Litvinov to the U.S. He also said that the absence of ambassadors in each other's capitals not only had a negative impact on the two countries but also increased the overall precariousness of the world, making efforts to establish international peace more complex.</p>
<p>The White House has not yet received a report on when Litvinov will arrive in the U.S. However, White House sources indicated that Litvinov will stay at the White House as a guest of the U.S. President. It is believed that all discussions will be informal and that issues such as the confiscation of American property during the Russian Revolution and the non-recognition of previous public debts will be discussed in detail. The U.S. President made no guarantees when announcing this development, only stating that he saw no reason why this sixteen-year-old issue should not be discussed. (National Telegram, 20th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Following the simultaneous announcement in Moscow and Washington of the upcoming U.S.-Soviet negotiations, it was reported that Litvinov would depart for the U.S. with two or three secretaries within the next week. Mrs. Litvinov will also accompany him. Upon arriving in the U.S., Litvinov will be joined by the current unofficial representative in Washington, Mr. Skvirsky, and Mr. Bogdanov, the general manager of Amtorg Trading Corporation. Both men have been in frequent contact with U.S. financial institutions and have been closely monitoring the trend of U.S. public opinion towards Russia. Although Soviet officials generally agree with the U.S. President's proposal that the talks should not bind either country's future actions, everyone believes that this is the first step towards the resumption of relations, which will lead to mutual recognition. It is also said that this new development is completely unrelated to the European situation caused by Germany's withdrawal from the League of Nations' disarmament conference but is believed to have a sobering effect on the overall international situation. One important figure even said that this move could ease tensions in the Far East. (National Telegram, 21st)</p>
<h3>Mutual Economic Benefit for Both Countries</h3>
<p>(Washington) Diplomatic circles here largely believe that this move is inevitable from an economic perspective for both countries. One diplomatic representative said that the situation is similar to the issue of Philippine independence. A few years ago, the issue of independence was generally ridiculed, but the farmers' desire to reduce sales competition gave rise to the Philippine independence movement. Now, the desire to sell overseas is eager to obtain the Soviet market, even at the cost of fully recognizing Soviet Russia. (Reuters Dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>Warsaw: News of the Soviet-American negotiations on the issue of recognition has been met with great satisfaction here. It is generally believed that the recognition of the Soviet government by the United States will be beneficial both politically and economically. The U.S. and Russia occupy important positions in the world economy, and once normal relations are restored, the global credit crisis will inevitably be alleviated. (Havas Dispatch, 21st)</p>
<h3>Senate Approval Not a Problem</h3>
<p>(Washington) Today, U.S. senators who expressed their opinions generally followed their own positions while also respecting the government's desire to recognize Soviet Russia. Therefore, it is anticipated that any agreement reached by the U.S. President will be approved by the Senate without any doubt when presented in the future. After the White House announced the exchange of messages between Roosevelt and Kalinin, Senator Borah immediately declared that he would support the U.S. government's recognition of Soviet Russia. Borah quoted Boyes' telegram to the local saying that this move was a step forward in global mutual tolerance and that the United States should have done this sooner. Other senators also praised the President's approach of eliminating all obstacles and moving forward directly. Initial comments from the financial community also expressed approval. Therefore, some say that the government does not intend to raise any preconditions for the recognition of Soviet Russia, including (1) no longer requiring Soviet Russia to first acknowledge and repay the $192 million previously lent to the Kerensky Provisional Government, (2) no longer requiring Soviet Russia to first acknowledge and return the property of American citizens confiscated in Soviet Russia, (3) not requiring prior acknowledgment and repayment of Soviet bonds worth $441 million, and (4) Soviet Russia does not need to promise in advance not to conduct communist propaganda in the United States. It is generally believed that the Soviet government will not refuse to accept such a compromise that would satisfy both parties. (National Telegram, 20th)</p>
<h3>Tokyo Deeply Concerned</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) This morning, after learning of President Roosevelt's invitation to Soviet Russian Central Executive Committee Chairman Kalinin to meet in Washington, the Foreign Ministry spokesman declared that the news was extremely noteworthy. The spokesman also said that rumors that Japan did not want the United States to recognize Soviet Russia were unfounded. He did not believe that the U.S. action had any connection to the current hostile war clouds between Russia and Japan. (Reuters Dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the issue of U.S.-Soviet talks on resuming diplomatic relations, the Japanese military announced this afternoon that the military has not yet received official announcements and the truth is not very clear. According to the general trend in the past, the U.S. government will raise the issue of debt from the Kerensky government era and the debt from the European War with Russia. If the Soviet Union acknowledges the demands of the United States, Japan also has tens of millions of dollars in debt, and the issue of the Chinese Eastern Railway can also be resolved immediately. If the United States abandons war debts and recognizes Soviet Russia, it will also affect the war debts of other allied countries in Europe. It is difficult to predict at this time whether the U.S. government will be able to make such a sacrifice. Moreover, the American Legion strongly opposes Soviet Russia, and Roosevelt would not risk recognizing Russia. Some say that the United States wants to contain Japan by allying with Russia, but Japan only suffers a spiritual blow. The United States recognizing Russia sooner or later is always possible. In the past thirteen years, there have often been such movements, but they have not yet materialized, which is quite strange. (United Chinese Press Dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Foreign Ministry spokesman commented today on the U.S.-Russian exchange of documents to begin negotiations on the resumption of relations, saying that Japan officially recognized Soviet Russia many years ago and is pleased to hear that other countries will also recognize it. If the U.S. and Russia resume relations, it will not only benefit the two countries but will also benefit other countries. After the resumption of U.S.-Russian relations, the U.S. national recovery program and the Soviet Russian second five-year plan can proceed more smoothly because the United States can obtain a large number of commercial orders from Russia, and Russia will export a large number of raw materials to the United States.

<h3>Litvinov to Depart for the U.S. at the End of the Month, Planning to Make a Brief Stop in Paris and London</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Soviet Russian Foreign Commissar Litvinov is currently planning to take a ship to the U.S. at the end of this month. This afternoon, Mr. Litvinov telegraphed the British and French embassies, instructing them to immediately investigate the ship schedules sailing to New York from today to the 5th of next month. It is reported that Mr. Litvinov plans to make a brief stopover in Paris and London because Soviet Russian trade agreement negotiations with the United Kingdom and France are currently underway. This afternoon, Russian officials stated that they hope the outcome of Mr. Litvinov's talks with the U.S. President will result in the U.S. government announcing its recognition of Soviet Russia, followed by the exchange of ambassadors and consuls between the two countries, and the establishment of a mixed committee to resolve the debt issue between the U.S. and Russia. This expression by Russian officials shows that Soviet Russia is willing to compromise somewhat on the debts demanded by the United States, which will eliminate the biggest obstacle to the resumption of relations between the two countries. In addition, it is expected that another committee will be established to complete the commercial contract and discuss loan purchase methods. (National Telegram, 21st)</p>
<h3>U.S. Senators Support Resumption of Relations; Domestic Opposition is Weak</h3>
<p>(Washington) Members of Congress currently in Washington almost all support Roosevelt's proposal to resume relations. There are two reasons for this: (1) The resumption of U.S.-Russian relations will greatly benefit U.S. commerce; (2) The restoration of diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Russia will consolidate the U.S. position in the Far East vis-à-vis Japan. Although the American Legion and the American Federation of Labor have expressed opposition to the recognition of Soviet Russia, Roosevelt has disregarded them and resolutely pursued his policies. Senator Borah, former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said that if Roosevelt's plan to recognize Soviet Russia succeeds, it can be described as divinely intelligent. (Havas Dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>Philadelphia, USA: Senator Reed, a Republican member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, issued a statement saying that he was very unhappy to hear that President Roosevelt had invited a Soviet Russian representative to Washington to discuss the resumption of U.S.-Russian relations, because the United States should not invite a Soviet Russian representative here. If the President wants to recognize Soviet Russia, he can recognize it. Senator Robinson, another Republican member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, declared that recognizing the Soviet Union would be a bold move and contrary to the interests of the American people. (Havas Dispatch, 21st)</p>
<h3>Japan Increasingly Isolated</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The United States and Russia, in view of the global, especially the Far Eastern crisis, are currently negotiating the resumption of formal diplomatic relations. Diplomatic circles here generally believe that the resumption of U.S.-Russian relations will make Japan increasingly isolated, and the future direction of China's foreign policy will also be a very interesting issue. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 21st)</p>
<h3>American Business Activities</h3>
<p>(New York) Several banks on Wall Street, in order to facilitate American commercial relations with Soviet Russia, will discount the promissory notes issued by the Soviet Russian Commercial Assistance Association in the U.S. and plan to directly provide loans to purchase goods. It is also reported that the federal government is prepared to lend money to Soviet Russia or guarantee the price of goods. Once U.S.-Russian commercial relations are restored, the main beneficiaries will be industrial machinery factories. U.S. exports to Russia totaled $330 million in 1930 but fell to $15 million in 1932. U.S. exporters hope to recover to at least $130 million annually in the future. Public opinion generally approves of the bankers' plan. Therefore, some say that the government does not intend to raise any prerequisites for the recognition of Soviet Russia, namely: (1) Not requiring Soviet Russia to first recognize and repay the $192 million that the U.S. previously lent to the Kerensky Provisional Government, (2) Not requiring Soviet Russia to first acknowledge and return the property of American citizens confiscated in Soviet Russia, (3) The $441 million in Soviet Russian bonds will not be required to be acknowledged and repaid in advance, and (4) Soviet Russia does not need to promise in advance not to conduct communist propaganda in the United States. It is generally believed that the Soviet Russian government will not refuse to accept such a compromise that would satisfy both parties. (Havas Dispatch, 20th)</p>

<h3>Moscow Newspapers Discuss U.S.-Russian Relations</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The Soviet government gazette "Izvestia" stated that the exchange of letters between the U.S. and Russia not only gives great satisfaction to public opinion in both countries but also gives satisfaction to all people who enthusiastically maintain and consolidate world peace. The newspaper continued, "Roosevelt's letter to Kalinin is a welcome event in the dark background of today's international relations. The increasing concern of the American people for the Soviet Union is reflected in the widespread belief that there are special advantages in cooperation between the two countries in the broadest range of areas. The Soviet Union has established stable and normal relations with its neighbors and the most important countries in the world in the past sixteen years. In these relations, the Soviet Union has consistently adhered to the principles of non-interference and economic cooperation. If the same basic rules of international relations can be followed on the other hand, not only will there be no obstacles to the normal development of relations between the Soviet Union and capitalist countries, but this development will also be beneficial to both parties. The United States is well aware of the position of the Soviet Union on issues related to the two countries. This position can lead to the firm belief that Litvinov and Roosevelt will negotiate in a spirit of mutual understanding in the future, and these negotiations will surely yield satisfactory results soon." The newspaper concluded, "The establishment of normal political and economic relations between the U.S. and the Soviet Union is not only sufficient to fill the existing deficiencies (depriving the two countries of the convenience arising from this relationship), but we also wish to trust that this will constitute the first step in the friendship between the two major countries. This move should be welcomed by sincere friends of peace." The Soviet Communist Party's mouthpiece, "Pravda," stated that Roosevelt's letter indicated that the United States had abandoned its previous policy towards the largest countries in Eurasia. This abandonment indicated that the leaders of the American bourgeoisie finally believed that they had to change course. They had to consider the fact that the Soviet Union occupied the most important position in the international community. At the same time, if this fact was ignored, it would undoubtedly harm their own interests. As for the appointment of Litvinov to discuss issues related to the two countries, the newspaper believed that it was enough to show the Soviet government's emphasis on future negotiations and its careful handling of this situation with special importance. The newspaper pointed out that some adventurers were trying to use the current international situation to bring the world into new disasters and asked, "Who can doubt that normal relations between the U.S. and the Soviet Union will recreate a kind of power correlation, so that adventurers who try to undermine peace will have to take this into consideration?" The "Industrialization" newspaper, a mouthpiece of the People's Committee for Heavy Industry, stated that in a state of "trade without recognition," the Soviet government was</p>
<p>only the entrusted buyer and seller representing one-sixth of the global area and 165 million people. When discussing the import plan for the second five-year plan, the Soviet economy had already anticipated the results of the Washington talks, which would strongly promote the development of U.S.-Soviet trade. They hoped that in trade with the Soviet Union, they would finally adopt the "American scale" and still be limited to the "childish scale." The Communist Youth League's mouthpiece, "Komsomolskaya Pravda," said that Roosevelt's letter came at a time when the entire capitalist world was facing a new tragic situation, such as conflicts in the Far East, tensions in Soviet-Japanese relations, U.S.-Japanese competition in the Pacific, Germany's withdrawal from the League of Nations, the deadlock at the Disarmament Conference, and the capitalist powers were preparing for a fresh slaughter. The above are some of the most important issues. Each issue contains enough gunpowder to explode next time. The improvement of Soviet-American relations will inevitably affect today's world political situation and strengthen international peace. The Red Army mouthpiece "Red Star" pointed out that Soviet-American relations are of utmost importance in the current extremely tense situation. The newspaper believes that the establishment of normal relations between the two countries will not only change the current international situation, but will also prevent the outbreak of new armed conflicts. The "Economic Life" newspaper expressed its opinion that the establishment of normal Soviet-American relations is now all the more natural because the United States has a particularly active concern for the Soviet Union. The newspaper believes that the economic relations between the U.S. and the Soviet Union will reach a grand scale, because the magnificent and highly developed American industry has great potential to supply our country's needs when it completes its industrialization plan on an unprecedentedly large scale.

<h3>Jubilation in Moscow</h3>
<p>(Moscow) At a time when the dispute over the Chinese Eastern Railway is at its most urgent, the United States suddenly has an air of providing spiritual assistance to Russia, which is very happy about this. General public opinion believes that the expansion of Japanese ambitions is the biggest reason for the rapprochement between the U.S. and Russia. (Reuters Dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Soviet Russian nation welcomes the actions of the American president. Newspapers everywhere are printing the news on the front page, and their comments praise the American president's actions as an element for maintaining world peace, which is very important. Russian officials can no longer hide their satisfaction, and the enthusiasm of the people for this is unprecedented in recent years. Today, the whole city of Moscow, in trams, in shops, and in the streets, everything discussed is focused on this matter. (National Telegram, 21st)</p>
<h3>Geneva Attaches Great Importance</h3>
<p>(Geneva) League of Nations figures this morning heard the news that U.S. President and Soviet Russian Foreign Commissar Livinov will be meeting, expressing welcome and deeply believing that the result will restore diplomatic relations between the two countries, and that the resumption of U.S.-Russian relations can facilitate the resolution of the current unstable situation in the Far East. They attach great importance because the U.S. action will ultimately affect the Far Eastern situation, generally believing that the United States' interests in the Far East are not as conflicting with Soviet Russia as they are with Japan, so after the relations between the U.S. and Russia become closer, it is hoped that Japan will greatly ease its policy in the Asian continent. The choice of Soviet Russia to send Livinov to the United States is especially welcomed, because Mr. Livinov caused an excellent impression at the Disarmament Conference, generally believing that this trip will be able to discuss a clear and complete understanding with the American president.

<h3>Swanson Discusses New U.S. Naval Plan - Aimed at Enhancing Naval Strength, Not Building New Bases</h3>
<p>San Francisco The U.S. Secretary of the Navy, Swanson, stated that the main purpose of the new U.S. naval plan is to enhance naval strength, not to build new bases. Swanson arrived here today to inspect the Mare Island Naval Shipyard. When asked if San Francisco Bay would become a major base, Swanson replied that, in his opinion, there was no need for expansion at the moment. He also indicated that the government's public construction plan was not primarily for the Navy, only allocating a portion to the Navy Department for increased hiring. Therefore, the number is limited and cannot meet all demands. The existing shipyards on the Pacific coast are sufficient for repairing warships and building some types of warships. There is no hope for major expansion of Pacific coast bases in the near future, as the current focus is on creating a strong Navy to meet the treaty requirements. (20th National Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Harbin Anxious About Possible Imminent Conflict Between Japan and Russia, Peaceful Resolution Increasingly Hopeless</h3>
<p>(Harbin) The "Manchukuo" government still refuses to release the detained employees of the Chinese Eastern Railway, so the people here are increasingly anxious about future developments. Coupled with rumors of Soviet Russia increasing troops on the border, there is even greater panic. It is said that the Russian military has hundreds of bombers with considerable power, capable of reaching Harbin and other places directly. The hope for a friendly resolution is gradually disappearing. Everyone feels that the elements for an explosion are now all prepared, only needing a fuse to ignite it. (21st Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) On June 20th, Shenyang authorities arrested 38 Chinese communists, including several women, accused of plotting to sabotage "Manchukuo" and carrying out assassinations. According to news this morning, those arrested have confessed to their crimes. The police authorities allege they are related to the Red Army in central China and are said to mostly come from Shanghai, Qingdao, and Guangzhou, with only a few natives of Manchuria.

<p>Since the commander of the Soviet Far East Army, General Galen, took office, he has been vigorously constructing the Vladivostok fortress, which had been neglected after the Russian Revolution, sparing no effort. He has successively hired German technicians. Since last year, he has especially doubled his efforts. Currently, Vladivostok has become the most solid fortress in the Far East. The Red Army authorities are confident that if anything happens, the Vladivostok fortress can at least sustain a prolonged war for six months to a year. Behind the city of Vladivostok, there are twelve forts, which are extremely sturdy. On Rosky Island in front of it, there are also eight coastal forts. On the south coast, there are also five or six heavy artillery emplacements. The area around Vladivostok is like a nest of cannons. To the north and south of the city, there are two air squadrons stationed. Within the Vladivostok Bay, there are mine-laying ships and torpedo boats of the Far East Fleet. Submarines transported by train have also been prepared, awaiting orders to launch. In addition to the Vladivostok fortress, large-scale fortification works are also underway in other areas along the Russo-Korean border and the Russo-"Manchurian" border. Solid underground rooms made of rammed earth are scattered throughout the wilderness, about two to three hundred meters apart. The lines of these fortifications are only single, double, or triple deep. The construction of these underground rooms is extremely ingenious, and one cannot immediately tell where they are located. A Japanese military officer infiltrated during a Red Army exercise one night to investigate, but was unable to find the opposing陣地 and did not know that he was already deeply behind enemy lines. The depth of the position is usually about one and a half li, sometimes two or three li. Japanese military authorities all acknowledge the险艰 of the Vladivostok fortress, making an attack extremely difficult, requiring a long struggle and great sacrifice. Japanese military commentator Shinsaku Hirata believes that the battle for the defense and attack of the Vladivostok fortress will be much more intense and tragic than the capture of Port Arthur.

Representatives of rural groups will meet here on October 25 to resume their advocacy for inflation and demand the establishment of a government bank and rural mortgage finance activities.

The above donation will be lent to farmers to implement the government's program of greatly reducing agricultural production. This huge donation will be borne by consumers within the United States. In addition to the handling donation, there is also a compensation donation for competing goods, so the income will be considerable, and most of it will go to farmers, but farmers must destroy many farmland.

<h3>Jinan Various Circles Publicly Pay Tribute to Wang Leping; Ding Weifen Represents the Central Government to Offer Sacrifices</h3>
<p>(Jinan) Today, people from all walks of life are publicly paying tribute to Wang Leping in the park, from morning to night. Ding Weifen represents the Central Party Headquarters to offer sacrifices and will be buried on the 22nd. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) The Preparatory Office for the Public Burial of Mr. Wang Leping held another ceremony meeting on the 20th to allocate reception staff and set the family sacrifice for the family members at 7:00 a.m. on the 21st and the public sacrifice for all preparatory members at 8:00 a.m. An啟靈 ceremony will be held at 11:00 a.m. on the 21st. Ding Weifen came to Jinan ten days ago to represent the Central Party Headquarters to offer sacrifices. The two memorial texts from the Central Party Headquarters and Committee Member Ding are recorded as follows: (1) On October 22nd of the 21st year of the founding of the Republic, the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, because of the death of Committee Member Wang Leping of the Central Executive Committee, specially sent Committee Member Ding Weifen of the Central Executive Committee and the President of the Supervisory Yuan to announce with the ceremony of great martial arts to the spirit of Committee Member Wang. In ancient times, those who had great achievements were given their names engraved on the Suxun, and sacrifices were offered in the great Cheng, with grand ceremonies and sacrifices. Ban Rui was used to reward Yilie, and stones were carved to record Zheng Yong, to repay the heavy virtue in steamed offerings and to engrave the dragon in the tripod. The righteousness is the same from now until now. Since unification has been established, Youming is at peace. The late Premier has been creating heaven and earth, saving the people from water and fire, turning chaos into order, and greatly expanding Hanxia. Although the sage has bright Yun, heaven and man Yun协, he is also working hard to assist and has exerted his effects. Your King Committee Member is humble, has great talents, and his opinions will surely convince everyone. The planning will always be a legacy. When the妖逆 is arrested and the righteous army rises, he will receive the strategy to move forward. With his unique divine strategy, he will assist Jing Yun and overcome whales and carps. He has already earned his merits, and his achievements have become a great contribution. Heaven does not遗, and he died in the middle. People give birth to the sadness of the star's fall, and the country unites to the pain of breaking the pillar. Every time we talk about great achievements, we think about Tao Lingdian, and the years change. Yong Yan sighs and feels guilty, suitable for respecting virtue, and petting this Huiyou, life is glorious and death is mourning. We will never forget. Today, we send Committee Member Ding to represent the entire meeting to respectfully offer sacrifices to comfort your spirit. Alas, the rivers and mountains have not changed, and we see the collapse of a pillar. Yushi often shines, and a monument of thousands of years will be erected. It is hoped that the heroic spirit will enjoy this high offering. (2) On October 21st of the 22nd year of the Republic, Ding Weifen of Rizhao respectfully offered sacrifices of pure wine and common food to the spirit of Wang Leping, a comrade, saying: It has been three years since you died, and your飒爽英姿,激昂之崇,氣 and 탁异之风裁, 时荣洄乎 my dreams, sad and not leaving my 懹. If you use your high hands and feet and wave your arms, although it will change, why should you be crystal objects, burying mud and turning into dust? However, when you travel to Shenghuo, you should always bring red pines and yellow stones, with wind and clouds to go to and from, or be the essence of mountains and rivers, the light of the sun and stars, to illuminate the embankments and nine hills, having already abandoned the turbulent world, freeing your hands from dust, you should always be happy and sad, why should you grieve? But I am afraid, sadness comes across, I sigh and weep, but I cannot help but be sorry for the lack of talent in this world. Alas, King Jun will last forever, with the talent of the king, blocking the Hengliu, can be a砥柱, but in the end, I cannot show what he has. What about the庸庸者, what is his number? With the king's age, he has just reached the age of strong kindness, but in the end, the day is heaven, then who can match this old age? What's more, I and you, 心照神交, Shuangxue does not change, I will rest to abandon me, and what else can I do? Alas, King Jun Xiaoxiao者 will be broken easily, right? 不羁之才, I look forward to its arrival, but why not avoid me saying it? After a hundred times of refining, Jianjin Why does he jump into the furnace one day? Could it be that there is a number, and things cannot be stopped? Alas, grief, overlooking the Jianghe's day, lamenting the injustice of heaven and earth, looking forward to today, who in our party can block the sinking sea and save the universe?

<h3>Higher Education Entrance Examination and Selection Test: History and Geography Test Questions</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Higher Education Entrance Examination for ordinary administrative personnel was on the second day on the 21st. There were 870 candidates. History Test Questions: (1) Wei was difficult for the Wei to cause trouble. Duke Wen revived it. Yue was stronger than Wu Goujian to dominate. When Qin destroyed the countries, the descendants of Wei and Yue enjoyed the most special benefits. Can we take the Odes of Yong and the Chronicles of Spring and Autumn and the Records of the Historian to list the important points? (2) Qin's domestic affairs were well known in Xun Qing. Until the time of the First Emperor, he ordered the people to take Dong as their teacher. Many criticized it, but Zhang Xuecheng said that it was in line with the ancient system. Can we list his theories and encourage officials to practice morality and learn academic knowledge? (3) Where did Qin and Han manage the borders to reach today? How many counties were set up? Is the number of households, the benefits of goods and services verifiable? In the early Ming Dynasty, the Arts Institute was built extensively, reaching far northeast. Are there any records of the area? Can we describe it in detail to clarify that the northeastern border of our country has always been far away? Geography Test Questions: (1) The development of the Northwest is currently heard in our country. Which place should be the main base camp so that whether it is economic or military, from Qinghai, Ningxia, Shaanxi, to Suiyuan, Xinjiang, and Tibet, it can all be used as a central response location? Try to use the shape of Guo Fu to predict the future development based on facts.

<h3>Yin Tong Takes Over as Director of the Beining Railway Bureau; Makes a Speech in Beijing Saying He Has No Diplomatic Mission</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Qian Zongze, Director of the Beining Railway Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, was transferred back to the Director of the Longhai Railway Bureau. The Ministry issued an order on the 20th that Yin Tong will be the Director of the Beining Railway Bureau. (21st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Yin Tong, the receiver of the Beining Railway, recently went south to Beijing with Li Zeyi, a senior consultant of the Haibu. Li turned to Shanghai and crossed to Japan. Yin stayed at the Yangtze River Hotel, saying that his visit to Beijing was absolutely not related to diplomacy. He reported the situation of receiving the Beining Railway to the Ministry of Railways. The road was occupied by the Japanese party to Luntai in the customs when the Sino-Japanese war was tense. According to Luntai to Tangshan and Qinhuangdao, the essence of the entire Beining Railway is located. The daily income is about 30,000 yuan. After severe negotiations, it was finally returned. Therefore, the Beining car has now reached Shanhaiguan. However, the station problem is still under negotiation because it is half in the customs and half outside the customs. The Japanese puppet government once requested through traffic, which was rejected by our side. If the principle of transportation is used and the Beining Railway comes forward to start through traffic, it is not impossible. However, the Japanese puppet government did not allow it, so it was shelved. The military and political situation in North China is stabilizing daily under the command of He Yingqin, Chairman of the Military Branch, and the proper handling of Chairman Huang of the Political Committee. All counties in 濼 are also being reorganized. As for the fact that Japanese Ambassador Yuji went north this time, because the Japanese Embassy is in Ping, it is a matter of course in Ping. Direct Sino-Japanese negotiations have not yet been discussed. Li Zeyi's mission to cross to the east is to go to 完成 the unfinished procedures of the Ninghai warship and has nothing to do with diplomacy. I will have to go north in the next few days.

<h3>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Strictly Orders the Public to Protect Transportation; County Roads in Various Provinces are Guarded by Various Armies; Baojia Along the Roads Must Also Protect the Roads</h3>
<p>Nanchang Communication: Chairman Chiang Kai-shek believes that Jiangxi Province is mostly mountainous and borders the mountainous areas of Hunan, Hubei, Fujian, Guangdong, Anhui, Zhejiang, and Yunnan. The terrain is treacherous, and transportation is obstructed, allowing the Red Bandits to use it as a base, either holding their ground or fleeing and causing disturbances. They have been causing trouble for several years without much effect. Therefore, he specifically decided on transportation pacification and Baojia self-defense, to prevent the bandits from returning after the troops leave and the bandits from retreating when the troops arrive. As a result, under the serious bandit disaster in Jiangxi Province, the major trunk lines of Gan-Zhe, Gan-Yue, Gan-Min, Gan-Xiang, and Gan-E have been completed one after another. The branch roads in the counties east of Jiangxi have also been completed one after another. The branch roads in the bandit and semi-bandit areas are also progressing strongly towards the bandit areas under the protection of the army. However, the Red Bandits specialize in sabotaging transportation and disrupting the rear, such as sending bogus Red Guards, guerrillas, and Young Pioneers to sneak into safe areas, burning bridges and looting passenger cars. Recently, the Gan-Yue and Gan-Zhe lines were suspended for a month or half a month due to bandits destroying bridges. On the Gan-Zhe road, bandits looted a car at Jiaoqiao, killing and injuring more than a dozen passengers, affecting travel. However, the stationed troops are limited, and in fact, it is impossible to post troops along the entire road. Moreover, the militia and Baojia in the counties are merely for show and have no self-defense capabilities. Therefore, in order to maintain the lifeline of military transportation, the Traveling Headquarters has decided on the following measures: (1) All bridges that take more than three days to construct must have bridgehead fortifications built and troops stationed to defend them. (2) Various sections of the road will be divided and designated to the stationed troops and local teams for defense. For example, the Gan-Yue road will be under the jurisdiction of General Commander Chiang, the Gan-Zhe road will be under the jurisdiction of General Commander Zhao, the Gan-Min road and the Lin-Chong and Lin-Yi lines will be under the jurisdiction of General Commander Chen, the Gan-Xiang line will be under the jurisdiction of General Commander Tan and Commander He, and the Gan-E line will be under the jurisdiction of division commanders Yue and Guo. They will be responsible for assigning troops to defend the important bridges on the transportation lines. Then, the county magistrates will assign teams to defend them. If they are destroyed by bandits, only those responsible will be held accountable. (3) The provincial government is ordered to quickly complete the Baojia within ten li on both sides of the highways that have already been opened to traffic, to clear out the scattered bandits and maintain the highways, and then continue to expand to both sides to form a solid area. After receiving the order, Xiong Shiyao, in addition to ordering the Highway Bureau and the administrative inspectors of the thirteen districts to comply quickly, also instructed the Department of Civil Affairs to formulate measures for the counties to organize the people to eliminate the scattered bandits and protect the highways, and ordered the county magistrates to implement them earnestly. The text of Chairman Chiang's general order is as follows:</p>
<p>"The construction of highways is the lifeline of military transportation, and the organization of the people is the foundation of local self-defense. In recent years, in view of the needs of suppressing bandits and clearing rural areas, we have carefully planned and urged their implementation, and have formulated a plan to organize and reorganize the Baojia and eliminate the scattered bandits. We have ordered the counties to universally organize the people, and must base it on the transportation situation, taking one or several lines as the base, and gradually expanding to both sides, so as to make the organization strict and the self-defense sound, and not allow the bandits to have gaps to invade. The county magistrates and Baojia personnel have their responsibilities, and should guide and instruct them so that the people in all localities have a considerable understanding and effectiveness of the Baojia and highways. However, according to reports, in areas where highways have been opened to traffic in Jiangxi, there are often bandits who sneak in to rob vehicles and disrupt transportation. The local Baojia have no precautions in advance, and have not searched for or arrested them afterwards. It is undoubtedly due to poor organization and unclear tasks. The county magistrate in charge usually lives in seclusion and does not go down to the villages to investigate. It is clear that he cannot effectively clear the rural areas near the highways, and that the government's orders are difficult to reach in remote areas. If we do not seek to rectify such irresponsibility and neglect of duty, the Baojia and the highways will lose their effectiveness. The future of bandit suppression will be greatly affected. For this reason, we order the provincial government to send personnel to supervise the counties to quickly organize anti-Communist volunteer teams, set up sentry posts, and search for scattered bandits, and at the same time order the responsible personnel of each section of the highway bureau to report the security situation along the highway line at any time for verification and handling. If banditry occurs in areas where highways have been opened to traffic in the future, and the organized people are secretly in communication with the bandits, the county magistrate and Baojia personnel will be held accountable. In addition to being punished in accordance with Articles 35, 36, and 37 of the Regulations for Compiling and Inspecting Baojia Household Registration and Articles 33 and 34 of the Regulations for Civilian and Military Officers and Soldiers Suppressing Bandits, they may also be regarded as bandit areas and punished severely in accordance with the government's Instruction No. 1589, without leniency. You are also ordered to report the implementation situation for record. This order." (October 19)</p>
<h3>He Jian Passes Through Hankou to Jiangxi, Inspects the Garrison Along the Way, and Consults on Suppressing Bandits in Hankou</h3>
<p>Hankou Communication: He Jian, Commander-in-Chief of the Western Route Army for Suppressing Bandits in the Five Provinces and concurrently Chairman of the Hunan Provincial Government, was summoned by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek by telegram. On the afternoon of the 19th, he led He Haoruo, Director of the Party and Government Affairs Office, Xu Rigan, Chief of the General Staff, Xiong Shiding, Director of the Adjutant Office, Wang Jingxi, Secretary, and dozens of telegraphers and guards, and traveled north on a special train on the Hunan-Hubei Railway. He arrived in Yuezhou at 3:00 AM on the 20th, inspected the Li Brigade of the 19th Division and the engineer battalion, and arrived in Puchi at 9:00 AM, where he summoned Feng Xingxian's unit of the 33rd Division for a speech. At 12:00 PM, he arrived in Xianning and summoned Li Dingwu's unit of the Provisional Third Brigade for a speech. At 3:00 PM in the afternoon, he arrived in Wuchang. He Chengjun, Zhang Qun, and others came to the station to welcome him and crossed the Yangtze River together. That evening at 6:00 PM, He and Zhang hosted a banquet for He Jian at the Hankou Office of the General Headquarters, and consulted on the aftermath of bandit suppression in the Hunan-Hubei border area. At 9:00 PM, He led his entourage on the Jianghe Wheel to Jiangxi. When He was in Hankou, he talked about the progress of the Western Route Army in suppressing bandits, saying, "I was summoned by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek by telegram. I was originally scheduled to go to Jiangxi on the 13th, but Xiao Ke's bandit gang invaded Pingli, so I could not make the trip. After Xiao's bandits were defeated in Yongxing, they reassembled more than 10,000 remnants, with more than 5,000 guns, and disturbed Liling and Pingxiang in two routes. They thought that most of the troops of our route army had already advanced to the front, and there were no heavy troops stationed in Pingli, Ninggang, Changsha, so they tried to take the opportunity to sneak in. The leading bandits went straight to Pingcheng. I received the alarm on the 13th, and immediately dispatched the 19th Division and the security regiments stationed in Changsha to reinforce Pingli. On the 14th, the garrison in Pingxiang contacted the bandits, and fierce battles took place on the 15th and 16th, without stopping day and night. Finally, the bandits were defeated, and more than 1,000 bandits were killed, especially those killed by airplanes. Xiao's bandits were forced by our army to flee to Baimao and Xiaohekou. Pingli was secured. When the Battle of Pingxiang was raging, the remnants of Kong Hechong's gang also advanced with all their strength towards Liuyang, Wanzai, and the six mountains between Guanchun and Yanneqiao. The Tao Xi Division and Brigade originally stationed there gave them a head-on blow. Kong's bandits could not resist and fled back to their old nest in Xiaoyuan. On the way, they happened to meet my Peng Weiren Division and were intercepted. The actual loss was almost exhausted. Peng's division passed by here unintentionally. If it had been slightly later or slightly faster, it would not have met the bandits. This is probably helped by heaven, not just human effort. Now we have a firm grip on the military situation, and the remnant bandits can be gradually eliminated. However, all political measures still need to be promoted, and financial difficulties are also a major constraint. In the future, we should find ways to coordinate, so that bandit suppression and aftermath can be carried out smoothly." According to He Haoruo, He Jian believes that eliminating corrupt officials, bureaucrats, local bullies, and evil gentry is the root of bandit suppression. Therefore, when he went on patrol to Wanzai, he executed Shen Guangzu, the former captain who was currently serving as the party committee member, who abandoned the city and extorted wealth from the people, and when he went on patrol to Ninggang, he executed Xie Ruxin, the district chief who cruelly extorted from good people and arbitrarily framed them. He will continue to pay attention to investigations at any time, so that corrupt officials and local bullies will disappear. If the politics are clear and the people live in peace, the bandits will not have the opportunity to rise again. (20th)</p>
<p>Changsha Communication: He Jian is scheduled to go to Pingxiang after staying in Nanchang for a short time to preside over the pacification. The purpose of going to Nanchang is: (1) To report to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek on the bandit suppression situation of the Western Route Army and to ask for instructions. (2) To report that the temporary expenses for bandit suppression by the Western Route Army must be at least 500,000 yuan per month. The monthly subsidy of 100,000 yuan is not enough. He requested an additional 400,000 yuan per month. It is unknown whether he will be approved. (19th)</p>
<h3>Yi Peiji Again Requests the Removal of Zheng Lie</h3>
<p>Yi Peiji yesterday again submitted a report to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Judicial Administration, requesting that Zheng be dismissed according to law and brought to trial. The original report stated, regarding the report, on the 17th of this month, Peiji had reported Zhang Cui Zhenhua and Zheng Lie for conspiring to harm a case to the Ministry of the Executive Yuan, requesting that Zheng Lie be dismissed and brought to trial. In particular, I cannot help but say that Zheng Lie, the Chief Prosecutor of the Supreme Court, telegraphed Zhu Shusheng, a prosecutor of the court, to bribe the witness Yin Qiwen on behalf of Zhang Cui Zhenhua, and privately instructed him to pursue the accounting part, deliberately seeking to harm me. Peiji has the original telegram as evidence. According to the Criminal Procedure Law, if a judge is biased, he can still apply for avoidance. If the chief prosecutor is biased, there is no way to save it. Although the court has the right to weigh the guilt or innocence of the cases prosecuted by the prosecutor, the prosecution is one body. Zheng Lie, as the Chief Prosecutor of the Supreme Court, should obey his orders from the high and lower prosecutors, which is different from the independence of the judge's powers. Even if the local high court covers the situation and resolutely declares him innocent, Zheng Lie must order the prosecutor to appeal. If the verdict does not find Peiji guilty of a crime, the road to redress for Peiji will be cut off before he even goes to court. The national prosecution agency is not set up solely for the sake of the wife of a central committee member. In order to maintain the faith in the judiciary and the hope of a fair trial, the government, even if Peiji keeps silent, must think of ways to remedy it. It cannot bear to see Zheng Lie abuse his power and Peiji fall into a trap. In urgent words, I earnestly ask that Zheng Lie be dismissed quickly, and Peiji will immediately surrender himself to the court, wait for a public verdict, to show justice and clarify the truth. With trepidation, I report to the President of the Executive Yuan and the Minister of Judicial Administration, Yi Peiji.</p>
<h3>Methods for Reorganizing Financial Administration in Jiangsu Province: Unifying Financial Administration, Stipulating Special Revenue and Expenditure, and Implementing the Treasury System</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Finance Department, at the Provincial Government's 603rd committee meeting, presented methods for reorganizing the province's financial administration, which were amended and passed. The explanation and methods are as follows:</p>
<p>It is found that Jiangsu's financial administration is extremely complex, and there are many barriers in revenue and expenditure. The reason is that financial management cannot be centralized, accounting systems cannot be unified, and comprehensive verification and auditing are difficult to be accurate, which has a significant impact on the province's finances. Now, three points of the reorganization methods are proposed as follows: 1. Unifying Financial Administration (1) Reason: It is found that the financial management situation in this province is complex, and the most serious aspect is the numerous special accounts. Each account has its own主管機關 (responsible authority), and revenue and expenditure cannot be unified, making reorganization impossible. In addition, various agencies in the province do not submit their budgets, final accounts, and revenue and expenditure statements on time, making it difficult for the Finance Department to compile statistics accurately, which is also an important cause of financial chaos. (2) Methods: To plan the overall finances, all financial matters should be directly managed by the Finance Department to achieve unification. Independent education funds, as decided by the Central Political Council, should be an exception. All revenue and expenditure of various agencies in the province should be deposited in the provincial treasury, and temporary categorization methods should be adopted in two ways: (A) Operating agencies should report their revenue and expenditure to the Finance Department monthly for review. Detailed rules will be set separately. (B) Collecting agencies should have their collection matters directly managed by the Finance Department, and expenditures should be executed according to the budget. Detailed rules will be set separately. 2. Stipulating Special Revenue and Expenditure Methods (1) Reason: Some provincial special funds are managed by the Finance Department, such as deed tax and 畝捐 (land tax for governance and transportation), while others are managed by other agencies. In addition to those managed by the Education Funding Management Office, there are construction 畝捐 managed by the Construction Department, special construction donations for water conservancy funds, farmer improvement donations, and agricultural bank funds. The Finance Department has no decision-making power in advance, and no accurate reports are available afterward, so the source and use cannot be known in detail, which affects the entire financial plan. (2) Methods: (A) The revenue of various construction special funds, whether collected by the provincial treasury or by the responsible authorities, should be reported to the Finance Department every ten days. Detailed rules will be set separately. (B) The expenditure of various provincial special funds must be jointly signed and issued by the Finance Department and the responsible authorities. Detailed rules will be set separately. 3. Implementing the Provincial Treasury System (1) Reason: It is found that the current system designates the Jiangsu branches of the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank as the provincial treasury. In counties where the above four banks are not located, funds should be remitted to the nearest branch of the four banks. However, counties often do not comply with the established methods and remit funds promptly. (2) Methods: If the above four banks are located in provincial government agencies and counties, revenue should be remitted or deposited immediately. If there are no such banks, efforts should be made to remit funds gradually, and no arbitrary delays in remittance and auditing are allowed. Detailed methods will be set separately.

<h3>Misunderstanding of 千金索 (a rope used for lifting heavy objects) Injures Worker</h3>
<p>The two 檻房 (rooms with railings) inside the county government gate are old and dilapidated, and there is a risk of collapse, especially the eastern one. Fearing a dangerous collapse, craftsman Xie Hongzhou was hired to supervise workers to dismantle them starting yesterday. First, the roof tiles and rafters were removed. Today, when the 楔柱 (wedge pillars) were to be removed, the craftsman struck the 千金索, which was connected to the safety of all the 樑柱 (beams and pillars). Unexpectedly, a policeman stationed at the government office planned to untie the rope to use it to trip branches. As soon as the rope was untied, craftsman Xu Aliang, caught off guard, was injured in the waist and ribs by the pillar. In extreme pain, he fell to the ground and was immediately carried by his companions to Songjiang Hospital for treatment. It is reported that there is no immediate danger to his life.</p>

<h3>Silk Factory Owner Disappears Due to Debt</h3>
<p>Recently, China's silk industry has been severely hit by the dumping of Japanese silk in Lyon and the United Kingdom at depreciated prices, and the majority of textile mills in Washington D.C. have been involved in labor strikes. The amount of silk stored in Shanghai has increased significantly, with supply exceeding demand and prices falling daily. The silk factories in this area have also been affected by this huge wave, and are in an unstable state, with many closing down. Those who can barely maintain their operations are also feeling the pinch of financial difficulties. The Huisheng Silk Factory under Huigong Bridge, which was opened by Xi Huian from Jiangyin, made a great profit during the prosperous era of the silk industry. In recent years, its finances have also been greatly threatened. The wages of female workers have not been paid for two periods. Creditors have been flocking to demand payment. Xi Huian was unable to cope and fled with his family a few days ago, whereabouts unknown. His eldest son, who was in charge of the accounts at the factory, also disappeared at the same time. All parties involved are shocked. It is reported that the factory owes about 10,000 yuan in debt. The creditors have found that Xi still has 10,000 yuan in shares in a certain silk factory in 南, and are trying to recover it, but it is still far from enough.</p>
<h3>New Grand Stage Established in Nanmen</h3>

<h3>Anti-Japanese Association Seizes Enemy Goods</h3>
<p>The Anti-Japanese Association has been working intensely since its reorganization. Yesterday (19th), informants seized two pieces of Nishiki Yu Miao's Japanese flannel, Hua Zhen Gong Hua Biao Hua Ji, totaling fifty pieces, and immediately took them to the association for inspection and sealing. A meeting was held in the afternoon to decide that all the Japanese yarn and cloth seized repeatedly for a long time might be affected by moisture and should be auctioned off. It was submitted to the county party department for transfer to the province for approval and execution.</p>
<h3>Two Russians Visit Cheng for Travel</h3>
<p>Russian Tuoma Naff, a sports professor, and Waikatar, a world traveler, arrived in Changshu from Shanghai for travel a few days ago. They requested assistance from the county government, and Section Chief Yu gave them a few yuan. On the 19th, they walked to Cheng and stayed at the Zhaoshang Hotel. The Public Security Bureau learned of this and sent Shen Yunhe, an official, accompanied by an English speaker, to inquire. It was said that the purpose was purely for travel. It was decided that they would take a Yangtze River wheel to Shanghai on the 20th. Their luggage was inspected and no prohibited items were found, only landscape photos and travel items. They were immediately advised to leave Cheng to avoid misunderstandings.</p>

<h3>Salt Workers Oppose Wuhuai Salt Shipping by Wheel</h3>
<p>The Twelve Weir Salt Workers' Union, with the Shanghai Bank, has contracted with merchants in northern Anhui to handle 20 tickets of salt from the Anhui coast to be shipped directly by wheel. Xu Liangfu, the manager of the Banpu branch of the bank, and members of the audit branch, have gone to Wuhu to handle the shipping procedures. The union learned that since the banks in Xiang-E-West have been successively converted to wheel transport, the only lifeline for boatmen and porters is the corner of the Anhui coast. If they suddenly switch to wheel transport, their livelihoods will be cut off. They have sent a telegram to the Ninth District Administrative Commissioner's Office, which will be forwarded to the provincial government for relief, to find ways to stop it.</p>
<h3>Three Japanese Visit Slender West Lake</h3>
<p>Three Japanese, accompanied by a certain person, visited the scenic spots of Slender West Lake from Zhenjiang at 1:00 PM on the 20th. The Public Security Bureau sent Qingdao Squad Leader Ma Zhonghan to lead the police to accompany and monitor them.</p>
<p>Jiashan</p>
<h3>Regiment Leader Arrested on Suspicion of Being a Bandit</h3>
<p>Gao Zengzhi, the leader of the Dingjiazha Guard Regiment's backbone team, had previously failed to suppress bandits and was criticized for his poor command, which led to the annihilation of the entire army. Unexpectedly, after the county government arrested the criminal Xu Wenkang and his uncle Xu Gang, the police captain Wang Jikang lured and arrested Gao Zengzhi at the same time. For a time, the outside world did not understand the truth. Later, it was discovered that Gao Zengzhi was from Anhui and was a fellow villager with the Xu nephews. The Xu family was the henchmen of the gangster Taibao Ashu and had served as detectives in the Second Water Police District. Xu Wenkang had served as a squad leader in the Dingjiazha Guard Regiment's backbone team, but was later dismissed for some reason and harbored resentment. This time, he and the Guard Regiment refused to arrest the lake bandits, and the first to be captured were Shi Lianyuan and his younger brother from Shizhang. They had repeatedly kidnapped Shen Hesheng and his son from the Dayaoxiang, Meng Guisheng from the Sanyuanbang. (During the fierce battle, the hostages were still hidden on the bandit ship and there were many other small hostages.) Gao Zengzhi had been stationed in Dingzha for a long time as a patrol leader in the Eighth Water Police Team. The authorities believe that Gao and Xu are both related to this bandit disaster, so they were arrested and imprisoned.</p>

<h3>Direct Train to Shanghai-Ping to Open Today; Capital Ferry Project is Huge; Track-Laying Equipment on Both North and South Banks is Quite Meticulous; Entire Project Took Twenty-One Months to Complete; Ministry of Railways Invites People from All Walks of Life in Shanghai to Visit the Capital</h3>
<p>The Capital Yangtze River Ferry is scheduled to hold an opening ceremony today, and the Ministry of Railways has invited reporters and representatives from all walks of life in Pingjin (Beijing-Tianjin) and Shanghai to visit the capital. Direct train service between Shanghai and Ping will be implemented at the same time. The two railway administrations have specially dispatched Zheng Baozhao, director of the Transportation Department, to participate in the opening ceremony. Details of the Capital Railway Ferry construction process, as well as the track-laying equipment on the north and south banks, are recorded in detail as follows:</p>
<h3>Going to the Capital to Participate</h3>
<p>After the completion of the Capital Railway Ferry, the Ministry of Railways is scheduled to hold an opening ceremony at 9:00 AM today on the "Yangtze River" ferry. The Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bureau has specially dispatched Zheng Baozhao, director of the Transportation Department, to participate in the capital this morning, taking the 8:00 AM express train from Shanghai North Station to Beijing. Vice Director Xie Wenlong also went with him. As for those invited by the Ministry of Railways from various Shanghai newspapers and industrial and commercial leaders to visit, they all went to the capital last night on the 11:00 PM Beijing-Shanghai express night train, and arrived at Xiaguan, Nanjing at 7:00 AM this morning to gather. Together with those visiting from the capital and Pingjin, they will board the reception car at Xiaguan at 8:30 AM this morning to participate in the ferry ceremony.</p>
<h3>Ferry Section</h3>
<p>In the past, when Ye Xianghu was the Minister of Transportation in Beijing, in order to connect the Jinpu (Tianjin-Pukou) and Beijing-Shanghai railways, there was a proposal to build a bridge over the Yangtze River for train traffic. The American bridge expert Walter was invited to design it, but it could not be implemented due to the high cost and difficulty of construction. After the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, the Ministry of Railways urgently sought to complete this essential transportation connection, so they promoted Zheng Hua's ferry plan, and established the Capital Railway Ferry Engineering Office, which began work on February 1, 1930. The ferry project includes two items: one is a movable approach bridge, and the other is a ferry boat. The so-called movable approach bridge is actually a wharf project, to prepare for the ferry boat to dock. Four holes are set up on both sides of Pukou and Xiaguan, all of which are made of four truss flower beam combinations. Except for the first hole (that is, one frame leaning against the river), which is 152 feet long, the rest are all 154 feet long, and the entire bridge is 614 feet long. The first hole is permanently leveled at any water level and is not sloped to reduce the angle formed by the approach bridge and the springboard, and to avoid the risk of vehicles being derailed or off the hook. The bridge is 25 feet 4 inches high and 20 feet wide. However, the end of the first hole facing the water must be connected to the three tracks on the ship, so it is widened to 44 feet, becoming a喇叭式 (trumpet style). A movable springboard is set at its end to connect with the ship's surface. The end of the fourth hole of the bridge is directly installed on the pier, and each end is suspended on a steel frame, using an electric rotary screw for lifting.</p>
<h3>Approach Bridge Engineering</h3>
<p>There are five piers on both sides of the approach bridge, which are made of reinforced concrete, with wooden piles underneath. The pile diameter ranges from 18 inches to 22 inches, and the length ranges from 16 feet to 70 feet. The pile surface resistance is 200 嗙 (pound) per square foot. The approach bridge materials were purchased from the British company Messrs Dorman Longs Co. Ltd (Messrs. Dorman Longs Co. Ltd, managed by Shanghai Maolong Foreign Firm). The total price is 72,023 British pounds. The lifting of the approach bridge, the opening and closing of the gate, and the interlocking of the signal are all electrically lifted. The mechanical parts of the approach bridge are located in the machine room on the bridge pier. The first pier uses a 100-horsepower motor, the second pier uses an 85-horsepower motor, the third pier uses a 45-horsepower motor, and the fourth pier uses a 25-horsepower motor. The total mechanism of each motor is located in the driver's room of the first pier. In case of an accident with the motor or wire, a hand-cranked mechanism is used for remedy. A cable ship equipment is built at the front end of the first pier to make the bow of the ferry boat close to a certain position. The wooden frame is 110 feet long, divided into 21 sections, 12 feet above the highest water level. A pontoon is placed on the outer end. When the ferry boat is close to the wooden frame wharf, the stern is tied to the pontoon to stabilize the entire boat and prevent it from shaking.</p>
<h3>Ferry Structure</h3>
<p>One ferry boat was prepared first, which was ordered from the British firm Swan Huntes &amp; Wigham Richardson Ltd., priced at 80,025 British pounds. The contract was signed on March 8, 1932, and the construction was completed on October 12 of the same year. The launching ceremony was held in New Bensai, Tyne River, England. It set sail for China in April of this year. Its structure is 372 feet long, 58 feet 6 inches wide, and has a speed of 14 and a quarter nautical miles per hour, with a load capacity of 1,550 tons. Three tracks are laid on the deck, each 300 feet long, which can carry seven 40-ton freight cars or four passenger cars. The entire ship can carry 21 40-ton freight cars or 12 of the longest passenger cars. There is a water-stabilizing tank on each side of the ship, and one longitudinal water-stabilizing tank at the front and rear, so that the ship's hull is always kept balanced. The stern is equipped with a one轉轍機 (switchgear) 42 feet long, for the locomotive to change tracks. The locomotive used to pull vehicles onto the ship and push vehicles ashore is stationed on the ship. Another ○｜。。｜-type was ordered from the British firm Skler Company, priced at 4,683 pounds, and all its designs are in line with the operation on the approach bridge. In addition to the approach bridge and the ferry boat, the railway ferry also has track-laying projects on both sides of the river, which are organized separately by the Beijing-Shanghai Railway on the south bank and the Tianjin-Pukou Railway on the north bank as designated by the Ministry of Railways.</p>
<h3>Track-Laying on the North Bank</h3>
<p>(1) Tracks: (A) A main track dedicated to the ferry train is separated from the main road (that is, the main road between Puzhen and Pukou stations) opposite the Pukou locomotive depot, along the Pukou freight yard, and reaches the ferry approach bridge, measuring 7,500 feet. (B) Another ring road is built beside the above-mentioned road, measuring 1,600 feet, for the passing of up and down ferry trains. (C) Three ring roads are laid near the approach bridge, each about 900 feet long, and three dead switches, two of which are about 700 feet long each, and one of which is 1,400 feet long, for loading and unloading vehicles. (D) The ferry main track is slightly sloping near the end of the approach bridge. For safety reasons, another insurance switch track is laid, measuring 1 each feet. The above tracks are self-contained and clearly separated from the existing freight tracks, so the ferry train operation does not interfere with the shunting work of the original freight yard. In addition, the turnouts of the above tracks, except for the end near the river, are limited by the location and use No. 8 turnout, the rest are all No. 10 turnouts. The above track-laying work started in early June this year and was completed in mid-September. (2) Buildings: (A) A flag station building is built on the ferry main track near the locomotive translation station and 1,800 feet away from the ferry approach bridge, to facilitate the management of train operations. The former is called Pukou Traffic Station, and the latter is called Pukou Ferry Station. (B) A ferry section chief's office building is built near the river bank. (C) The original office building of Huadong Coal Mine Company is temporarily borrowed as the office space for the ferry personnel of the Machinery Department, and its location is adjacent to the ferry section chief's office. (D) Two ferry police outposts are set up, one near the approach bridge and one at Pukou Ferry Station. (3) Signals: (A) A long-distance signal and a station entry signal are set up at the junction of the ferry main track and the main road. The station entry signal has two arm-shaped signboards, one indicating a direct drive to Pukou Station, and the other indicating a direct drive to the ferry main track. (B) A departure signal is set up at Pukou Station. However, the above signals have not yet been purchased and cannot be installed temporarily. (4) Electrical Road Sign: Three sets of electrical road signs are added, one set for use between Pukou Traffic Station and Pukou Station, one set for use between Pukou Traffic Station and Puzhen Station, and the third set for use between Pukou Traffic Station and Pukou Ferry Station.</p>
<h3>South Bank Connection</h3>
<p>After the Railway Bureau was ordered in the 21st year to prepare for the South Bank connection project, it drafted the first budget in August and submitted it to the Ministry for review. The Ministry approved it in October of the same year, and then proceeded to invite bids for the roadbed filling project. The bidding results were announced on November 25th, with Wang Rongji's construction team winning the bid with the lowest price of one yuan and sixteen cents per cubic foot. The contract was signed on December 31st, and work began on January 2nd of the following year. The filling was completed after eight months. The platform and paving projects began in August and were completed by the end of September. What remains to be done are the rain shelter project and the office buildings for the vehicle, machinery, and administrative departments. The previous budget only covered the connecting railway line, and equipment such as the parking lanes, platforms, and rain shelters at Xiaguan Station were not included. Therefore, a second budget was prepared in October of the 31st year and submitted to the Ministry for review. The Ministry approved it in November of the same year. In August of the 22nd year, the Ministry again ordered the addition of 1,800 feet of shunting track, over 900 feet of curved track, an extension of the platform by 340 feet, and an extension of the rain shelter by 480 feet. The tracks and platforms have now been completed, but the extension of the rain shelter requires significant funds. To take a comprehensive approach, approval has been granted to build 320 feet of rain shelter and extend it by another 280 feet, totaling 600 feet. The project will be put out to bid soon, and its completion is expected in the near future. The main features of the South Bank ferry facilities are as follows: (1) The entire ferry main line is approximately 2,200 feet long, starting from the old first track of Nanjing Station, about 1,700 feet from the station, branching out in a 6.5-degree curve to reach the ferry bridge.

<h3>Minister Song Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning to Discuss Candidates for Various Industry Control Committees; Wang Jingwei Did Not Come to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Minister of Finance Song Ziwen returned to Nanjing on the 17th aboard the customs patrol ship "Xia Guang" to handle affairs at the Ministry in Nanjing and to discuss all matters related to the Economic Committee with Premier Wang Jingwei and others. As the Industry Control Committees for silk, grain, and other industries are about to be established in order, and as the issue of candidates needs to be discussed with the financial, silk, and other sectors in the city, he arrived in Shanghai again on the afternoon of the day before yesterday at 6:00 PM, accompanied by seven people, including staff and guards, aboard the same ship "Xia Guang." He arrived at the port at around 9:00 AM yesterday morning and landed at the Yangshupu Wharf. The Customs Superintendent of Jianghai, Tang Haian, and Mrs. Song, Zhang LeYi, both came to welcome him. They returned to their private residence on Qiqi Road by car to rest. Premier Wang Jingwei did not come to Shanghai yesterday, but his wife, Ms. Chen Bijun, arrived in Shanghai by overnight train, arriving at the port at 7:30 AM yesterday morning.</p>
<h3>Sun Ke Talks About the Current Situation: Mongolia's Autonomy, the Mongol and Tibetan Affairs Commission to Be Reorganized as a Ministry; Easing Sino-Japanese Relations Is Out of the Question; Internal Rectification Must Come First Before Dealing with External Affairs</h3>
<p>President of the Legislative Yuan Sun Ke and his wife arrived in Shanghai by overnight train from Nanjing yesterday morning. After getting off at Zhenru Station, they went directly to their private residence on Columbia Road to rest. At 10:00 AM, he received reporters from various newspapers at his residence and discussed the latest domestic and foreign affairs and the international situation. The following is a record of his conversation:</p>
<h3>Active Preparations for Various Control Committees</h3>
<p>According to Sun Ke, since the reorganization and establishment of the National Economic Committee, it has been actively carrying out all its work. The committee's Cotton Industry Control Committee has now been formally established, and various other control committees, such as those for grain, silk, and coal, are also actively being prepared. Once the candidates for the members of each control committee have been determined, they will be established in the shortest possible time, as needed.</p>
<h3>The Central Government Attaches Importance to Mongolia's Autonomy</h3>
<p>The Central Government attaches great importance to the issue of Mongolia's local autonomy and has decided to send Interior Minister Huang Shaoxiong in the short term to</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>take a trip to convene local leaders, explain the Central Government's intentions, and guide the local autonomy along the necessary path. It is hoped that Mongolia's local autonomy can proceed under the guidance of the Central Government at the appropriate time. At the same time, the Mongol and Tibetan Affairs Commission will be reorganized as the Mongol and Tibetan Affairs Ministry to specialize in the matter. Meanwhile, autonomous committees will be established throughout Mongolia to guide everything.</p>
<h3>The New Unrest Has Not Been Settled, and Luo Jiang Will Return to Nanjing</h3>
<p>The internal disputes in Xinjiang are actually due to the inability of Sheng Shicai and Ma Zhongying to work together harmoniously, which is a regrettable matter. Foreign Minister Luo Wengan is currently at the Soviet border and is said to be planning to return to Nanjing in the shortest possible time. It is understood that the most important task of Luo's trip is to investigate the truth about the secret agreement that the former chairman of the province, Jin Shuren, secretly signed with the Russian side, as the Central Government was never informed of this agreement beforehand. Luo's trip is intended to resolve this matter in passing; otherwise, there may be adverse consequences in the future.</p>
<h3>It Is Not Yet the Time for Sino-Japanese Negotiations</h3>
<p>When Sun Ke spoke to this point, reporters immediately asked him: "Since our country's ambassador to Japan, Jiang Zuobin, has returned to his post, and since Sino-Japanese diplomats have been coming and going frequently recently, with the Japanese ambassador Arimiyoshi Akira heading north, the deputy director-general of the League of Nations Secretariat, the Japanese national Sugimura, and the current Japanese ambassador to Canada, Tokugawa, coming to China, and the member of the Beiping Political Committee, Li Zeyi, going to Japan, etc., in the observation of the general public, Sino-Japanese diplomacy seems to be taking a sudden turn for the worse and seems to be conducting direct negotiations. However, what is the content, and can you tell us?" Sun Ke replied, "Direct Sino-Japanese negotiations, in fact, may not be possible at present. Japan has recently realized that, in light of the world situation and the tense relations with Soviet Russia, it should take a more moderate attitude toward China. As for so-called direct negotiations, recognizing the puppet organization, and using the abolition of consular jurisdiction as a condition, etc., the government has long been aware of the relative importance of these gains and losses and will never risk the disapproval of the world and bring about its own destruction. If the abolition of consular jurisdiction does not cause the other party any losses, and if we rashly recognize the puppet organization, then there will be no hope of recovering lost territory. In terms of relative importance, how can we conduct negotiations? There is absolutely no possibility of a compromise."</p>
<h3>The International Situation Is Becoming Increasingly Tense</h3>
<p>Sun Ke concluded by saying that since Germany withdrew from the League of Nations, the international situation has become increasingly tense. In addition, relations between Japan and Russia and between the United States and Japan are deteriorating day by day. Observing from various perspectives, a serious change in the international situation may occur in the near future. How our country will cope with this situation must be studied and prepared in advance. Therefore, I (Sun Ke) and the central authorities, such as Premier Wang and Chairman Jiang, have exchanged views and all agree that we cannot speak of dealing with external affairs unless we first rectify our internal affairs. Therefore, we sincerely hope that the people of the whole country, at this time of great difficulty, will be united from top to bottom and work together with the government authorities to concentrate our efforts and seek development together. Otherwise, the First World War can serve as a warning, and we will ultimately be at the mercy of others. Therefore, at present, we can only bury our heads and work hard, taking one step at a time. Empty words are of no help to the facts and should be acted upon quickly."</p>
<h3>Sun Yat-sen's Bronze Statue to Be Unveiled on a Specific Date: Next Month, the 12th</h3>
<p>In the central area of the city, between the new City Hall building and the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall, which has not yet been built, there is a space of land where a bronze statue of Sun Yat-sen is planned to be placed. It is being sculpted by Jiang Xiaojian. According to sources from the City Party Headquarters, the 12th of next month is the anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's birth. A unveiling ceremony is planned to be held at the new City Hall at that time. Therefore, the bronze statue of Sun Yat-sen being sculpted by Jiang must be completed before the anniversary.</p>
<h3>American Community Celebrates Mr. Cunningham's Appointment as a Diplomat</h3>
<p>The Continental News reports that the U.S. Consul General, Mr. Cunningham, has served in consulates in various countries for 35 years. The 31st of this month is the anniversary of his appointment as a diplomat. The American community in this port will hold a celebration at the French Chamber of Commerce, and a portrait of Mr. Cunningham painted by the famous American portrait artist, Mr. Breck, will be unveiled. The portrait will be presented to the U.S. government in the name of the American community in Shanghai as a permanent memorial to express the expatriates' love and respect. Mr. Cunningham has been stationed abroad since 1898, when he was appointed as the Consul of Aden, and has served in Aden for three years, Bergen, Norway, for five years, Durban, South Africa, for four years, Bombay, India, for two years, Singapore for two years, and then he was transferred to China, first stationed in Hankou for five years, and then in September 1919, he took over as the Consul General in Shanghai, where he has served for 14 years. He has been very harmonious with the Chinese and foreign people and is especially loved by the American community. Ten years ago, when Mr. Cunningham commemorated the 25th anniversary of his service as a consul, the American community in this port also held a celebration ceremony.</p>
<h3>The Case of Japanese Rice Being Shipped to Shanghai Under Public Scrutiny; Various Organizations Send Letters and Telegrams in Succession, Advocating the Punishment of Unscrupulous Merchants</h3>
<p>Since the first batch of 25,000 bags of old Japanese rice was shipped to Shanghai, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has sent letters to various rice merchants to stop sales. The Municipal Farmers' Association telegraphed the Executive Yuan yesterday, stating that Japanese rice should be used to relieve disasters and rescue refugees in Northeast China. The Executive Committee of the Municipal Party Headquarters also requested the Social Affairs Bureau to promptly and properly plan to stop the rice. The Food Committee convened an emergency meeting. The details of each situation are recorded below.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Warns the Eight Firms</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the eight rice firms, stating: "Gentlemen, regarding the matter of old Japanese rice being shipped to Shanghai for dumping, the first batch of 25,000 bags has already arrived in Shanghai and stored in Yongxing Warehouse. According to reports, the Japanese rice stored in the warehouse has been accepted by eight firms: Changyi, Wanxingxiang, Dingtai, Changmao, Dafeng, Rencheng, Yongda, and Shenfeng. We are deeply shocked by this. Merchants seek profit and are related to the normal operation of business, but at this time of difficulty, all rice merchants should consider: Who is now intent on destroying our country? Who is dividing our territory? Knowing this and disregarding everything, greedy for the cheap price and profitable gains, willing to exchange money for their goods, the result is no different from providing the enemy with grain. This is truly not knowing that there is a country or that there are compatriots. The Shanghai merchants, who are known as the nation's advanced and full of patriotic spirit, have taken such a perverse action, which is truly heartbreaking. Therefore, we issue a serious warning, hoping that these firms can quickly realize their mistake and change course. Otherwise, in the interest of justice, this Chamber will not be able to show any leniency." This letter is addressed to Shenfeng, Changyi, Dingtai, Dafeng, Yongda, Changmao, Rencheng, and Wanxingyu.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Farmers' Association Telegraphed to Request Confiscation</h3>
<p>The Municipal Farmers' Association telegraphed the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry of the National Government yesterday, stating: "(The above is omitted.) The eight rice firms in Shanghai—Shenfeng, Changyi, Dingtai, Wanxing, Changmao, Dafeng, Yongda, and Rencheng—secretly ordered 50,000 bags of old Japanese rice from Japanese merchants. The first batch of 65,000 bags of Japanese rice was shipped to Shanghai the day before yesterday. When the news came, we were shocked and angered. Our country's farmers have been affected by the dumping of foreign rice for years, and rice prices have plummeted. The bankruptcy of the rural areas has become the economic center of the current society. In order to save the situation, our government has actively levied dumping taxes on foreign rice and relaxed the ban on grain exports. As the farmers were cheering, who would have thought that eight rice merchants in this port, including Shenfeng, would disregard domestic agricultural products and secretly import Japanese rice? This is truly a loss of conscience and madness. The Association is determined to safeguard the rural areas and restore the farmers' economy and cannot remain silent. Therefore, we specially telegraph your (Yuan) Ministry, requesting that the Japanese rice be seized, confiscated, and distributed to relieve the Yellow River flood and refugees in Northeast China. This can both punish unscrupulous merchants in the future and stabilize rice prices in the present. This urgent telegram cannot express our anxiety enough. Shanghai Municipal Farmers' Association, Ma."</p>
<h3>The Municipal Party Headquarters Sent a Letter Requesting a Halt</h3>
<p>The Executive Committee of the Shanghai Special Municipality Party Headquarters sent a letter to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, stating: "Gentlemen, according to the report of Yan Shenshan, Jiang Shaoqing, Wang Yuelou, and other Anhui rice merchants in Shanghai, the dumping of Japanese rice in Shanghai harms the foundation of the country and should be stopped to save the rural areas. The country takes the people as its foundation, and the people take food as their heaven. In recent years, foreign rice has been dumped in our country, causing the bankruptcy of the rural economy and the decline of commerce. The Municipal Grain and Rice Industry and other groups have unanimously telegraphed the government, urging it to issue a clear order as soon as possible, levying import duties on foreign rice in order to remedy the situation. But alarming news has come, making people despair. Recent reports in various newspapers state that a large batch of Japanese rice will be shipped to Shanghai. 25,000 bags have already been loaded and will arrive at the port soon. Rice merchants in various ports have heard this news and telegraphed the inland areas to stop purchasing. The rice market in this port will collapse immediately, the rural economy will be invisibly blocked, commerce will be destroyed, and the foundation of the country will be shaken. Nothing could be worse. If a plan for relief is not devised quickly, what future can we imagine? For the sake of maintaining their own business operations, for the sake of saving the lives of farmers, and for the sake of preserving the safety and security of the country, we dare to sincerely request your Bureau, to forward a telegram to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance of the National Government, quickly devising a way to stop the import of Japanese rice and immediately implementing an increase in import duties on foreign rice, in order to save the rural areas and maintain the foundation of the country, etc. Accordingly, we have prepared a letter and forwarded it to you, hoping that you will investigate and, as soon as possible, convene all the rice industry groups in the city to properly plan a method, and immediately implement a stop, in order to save the situation. This is addressed to the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, Standing Committee Members of the Executive Committee of the Shanghai Special Municipality, Pan Gongzhan, Wu Xingya, and Tong Hangbai."</p>
<h3>The Social Affairs Bureau Convened a Meeting</h3>
<p>The original Food Committee of this city, whose members are half government officials and half rice merchants, has a meeting every month. Since Shenfeng and the other eight rice firms ordered Japanese rice, the Social Affairs Bureau, in order to clarify the truth and properly plan a solution, specifically decided to convene a temporary emergency meeting of the Food Committee next week to jointly devise a plan to stop the rice, and to notify the Shanghai Soybean and Rice Industry Association, the Coarse Grains and Oil Cakes Industry Association, and the Rice Industry Association and other groups in the city to send representatives to participate at that time.</p>
<h3>The Ningbo Chamber of Commerce Telegraphed to Request Taxation</h3>
<p>The Ningbo Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Central Government, stating: "The Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance of the National Government, in view of the fact that Japan has recently shipped over one million shi of rice in batches to China for dumping, and 15,000 shi have already arrived in Shanghai, destroying commerce and harming the rural areas more than anything else, we request that you quickly order the Ministry of Finance to implement the dumping tax on foreign rice in advance and increase the tax rate in order to provide relief. Ningbo Chamber of Commerce bows."</p>
<h3>Tokugawa Returned to Shanghai and Talked About His Meeting with Wang Jingwei; Sugimura Will Fly to Hankou Today</h3>
<p>Tomorrow Morning He Will Leave Shanghai to Return to Japan.</p>
<p>The New Voice News reports that Tokugawa Iemasa, the current Japanese ambassador to Canada, and Sugimura Yotaro, the Japanese special envoy, entered Nanjing together. Sugimura will fly to Hankou by plane from Nanjing this morning, and Tokugawa returned to Shanghai on the Jing-Hu night express train the day before yesterday, arriving at the port at 7:30 AM tomorrow morning. After arriving in Shanghai, Tokugawa had a brief conversation with a reporter from the New Voice News over the phone, stating that after arriving in Nanjing, he and Sugimura visited Wang Jingwei, the Premier and Foreign Minister of the Executive Yuan, but were unable to meet with Minister of Finance Song Ziwen. The content of the conversation with Wang was ordinary and did not involve political issues. He also briefly described the situation in the Far East. After arriving in Shanghai, he will return to Japan on the Japanese ship Shanghai Maru on Monday (tomorrow). Sugimura will fly to Hankou tomorrow (today). When asked whether Sugimura planned to visit Chiang Kai-shek, the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, on the way to Hankou this morning, Tokugawa replied, "I don't think so." He then said that they were quite regretful (meaning that they were quite regretful for not being able to visit Chiang). Finally, he said that Sugimura originally planned to visit Changsha and Yichang after arriving in Hankou, but due to transportation and time constraints, he probably wouldn't be able to go. Sugimura will probably return to Shanghai via Nanjing within a day or two after arriving in Hankou.</p>
<h3>Zhao Qilu, Chief of Staff of the Northern Route Army, Will Fly to Nanchang Today; Mao Naigong, Director of the Adjutant's Office, Will Accompany Him</h3>
<p>Gu Zhutong, Commander-in-Chief of the Bandit Suppression Army's Northern Route, is scheduled to hold an oath-taking ceremony at 9:00 AM on the 23rd in Nanshi. Zhao Qilu, the Chief of Staff, came to Shanghai previously to negotiate important official matters. Now that the matter has been completed, he is scheduled to fly to Jiujiang today at 8:00 AM, accompanied by Mao Naigong, the Director of the Adjutant's Office, on a China National Aviation Corporation plane, and then transfer to Nanchang to attend Commander Gu's inauguration ceremony.</p>
<h3>Wang Yansong Returned to Shanghai from Jiangxi and Talked About the Great Victory of the Bandit Suppression Military Affairs; But the Aftermath Needs National Assistance</h3>
<p>The New Voice News reports that Wang Yansong, the Executive Committee member of the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, went to Xun this time to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. Now that the matter has been completed, he returned to Shanghai yesterday. A reporter from the New Voice News specially interviewed him and asked about the recent situation of bandit suppression. According to him, the bandit suppression military affairs have been very successful. The Chairman himself went to Fuzhou to direct the operation, working diligently day and night, which was greatly appreciated by the people of Jiangxi. Now the people from all walks of life in the Jiangxi provincial capital, such as the Chamber of Commerce, the YMCA, the banking industry, and the money industry, have suffered greatly from the Red bandits in Jiangxi for six years, with arson, killing, and looting, causing unprecedented disasters. Now, the central government's policies are to vigorously launch a punitive expedition. Chairman Chiang himself went to Jiangxi to supervise the military, in order to clear up the bandits that have accumulated over six years. The people of the province should pool their resources and provide great assistance in order to achieve success. Therefore, the Jiangxi Provincial Capital People's Association for Assisting in Bandit Suppression was organized to take charge of the matter. Since its establishment in January, the general outline of its work is briefly described as follows: (1) Organizing Iron Shoulder Teams: The first priority of the army's advance and suppression is transportation, but the mountains and valleys in various counties of Jiangxi are not suitable for the use of donkeys, carts, or boats. The Association, seeing this, organized Iron Shoulder Teams to specialize in transporting supplies for the National Army, so that the National Army would have no worries about the rear and could uphold its determination to conquer. It is planned to establish a headquarters, a team branch, sixteen battalion headquarters, and eighty company headquarters, with more than 130 soldiers in each company, totaling more than 10,000 people. The monthly salary is estimated to be around 130,000 yuan. (2) Organizing Rescue Teams: Soldiers sacrifice their lives for the country, suppress bandits, and rescue the people, fighting bravely on the battlefield. All the soldiers are filled with righteous indignation, so there is no need for coercion. Our civil groups admire and reward heroism, and there is no lack of common hatred for the enemy. Therefore, eight rescue teams were organized, divided into two departments, health and sanitation, to accompany the army and take on the responsibility of rescue, providing care for the wounded or sick soldiers, similar to a field hospital. (3) Organizing Trading Groups: Gan East and Gan South have long been occupied by bandits, and residents have migrated. It is very difficult for the army to penetrate deep into the area to obtain food, oil, salt, and daily necessities. The Association used its own capital to gather merchants and organize a trading group, giving them passes and requesting protection from the military and political authorities. It also organizes the interest rate for the sale of goods, prohibiting the raising of prices to adapt to the needs of bandit suppression. (4) Allocating Funds to Subsidize County Governments: Military intelligence is paramount, and knowing oneself and one's enemy is the key to victory. The counties that have been harassed by bandits are impoverished and exhausted, and the situation is very bleak. Therefore, the Association allocates funds to the county governments each month according to the importance of the military situation in each county to establish intelligence, delivery, sentry, spy, and telephone agencies, in order to transmit and contact information and have access to intelligence. In addition, the Association also organizes propaganda teams, comfort teams, and investigation and inspection groups, doing everything within the power of the people. In total, the above tasks require about 100,000 yuan per month. The Association has been established for eight months since January, and the total expenditure for assisting in bandit suppression has reached about 800,000 yuan, all of which has been voluntarily contributed by the people of this province. For example, the Association has assisted with the funding of 140,000 yuan for the construction of the airfield, and 120,000 yuan for the construction of fortified city defense roads, which are particularly noteworthy. On this trip to Jiangxi, I was hosted at a tea party by the Association and the local Chamber of Commerce, who explained everything. I was extremely moved by the enthusiasm of the Association's work in assisting in bandit suppression. In short, it can be asserted that the bandit suppression military affairs will surely be a final success. However, after the success, how to handle all the industrial and commercial construction and local rehabilitation matters is a major problem. It is necessary for people from all walks of life in the country to have the sentiment of "treating others as they would treat themselves" and be determined to rescue Jiangxi and save themselves in order to achieve success.</p>
<h3>The Speed of Telegraphs</h3>
<p>Since the improvement of telegraphs in Shanghai, telegraph communications in all aspects have become more convenient. For example, at the National Games in Nanjing, the Nanjing Telegraph Bureau specially set up a dedicated line at the venue to communicate directly with Shanghai, so the transmission of news was extremely fast. The special editions of our newspaper compiled during the Games were mostly sent by telegraph, which is sufficient proof. Moreover, the fastest cities in the country to communicate with Shanghai can receive a reply in 15 minutes, which is relied upon by users. The future of telegraphic reporting is promising.</p>

<h3>American Destroyers Depart from Shanghai and Return to Fiji</h3>
<p>The United States Navy fleet, which came to Shanghai from Fiji in May and then went to North China to seek refuge, returned to Shanghai at the beginning of this month and will reportedly return to defense in succession. On the day before yesterday (17th), destroyers No. 226 and No. 225 left Shanghai, and yesterday afternoon, seven ships, including No. 219, No. 222, No. 224, No. 230, No. 118, No. 227, and No. 212, also left Shanghai. Other ships will also reportedly return to defense within the next few days.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Government, Upon Instruction, Provides Relief for the Stagnant Sales of Domestic Wheat; Deliberating on the Situation, Restricting the Collection of Brokerage Tax</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government of this city, upon receiving instructions from the Executive Yuan regarding the stagnant sales of domestically produced wheat, immediately ordered the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to comply. The Executive Yuan's instructions are copied below: "The Yuan has previously, in order to alleviate the stagnant sales of domestically produced wheat, decided in its 131st meeting to have the Ministries of Industry, Railways, and Finance, the Nanjing Municipal Government, and the Rural Reconstruction Committee investigate the situation and devise remedies. Subsequently, the aforementioned ministries, governments, and committees completed their investigations and submitted to the Yuan a draft of emergency relief measures. The sixth item of the draft measures states, 'Local governments should be ordered to make every effort to regulate fair procedures for brokerage tax and handling fees collected by grain merchants and brokers in various locations, in order to reduce the burden on farmers.' It has been observed that in recent years, the rural economy has been extremely difficult. The collection of brokerage tax and handling fees by grain merchants and brokers everywhere has been sufficient to exploit farmers. Strict restrictions are urgently needed. The aforementioned measures proposed by the various ministries, governments, and committees are highly essential. In addition to separate orders, the municipal government is hereby instructed to deliberate on the local conditions, properly devise fair measures regarding the collection of brokerage tax and handling fees by grain merchants and brokers, and submit the handling situation to the Yuan for review. This is of utmost importance. This order."</p>
<h3>The Ministry Dispatches Personnel to Investigate the Electrical Workers' Strike; The Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Mr. Feetham, Conducts Mediation</h3>
<p>Due to the serious situation of the Shanghai electrical workers' strike and the fact that it concerns the struggle between Chinese workers and international capitalism, the Ministry of Industry has dispatched Mr. Bao Huaguo, the Chief of the Fourth Section of the Labor Department, to Shanghai to investigate in order to understand the truth and facilitate handling. After arriving in Shanghai the day before yesterday, Mr. Bao immediately went to the Municipal Government to meet with Secretary Yu, inquired about the course and current state of the dispute, and discussed handling measures. Subsequently, Secretary-General Yu introduced Mr. Bao to Mr. Xu Yefu, the Chief of the Third Section of the Social Affairs Bureau. Mr. Xu handed over the entire file of the case to Mr. Bao for review. At the same time, they also discussed handling measures, deciding to first summon the labor side for questioning and persuade the workers to resume work. A decision was also made regarding the pension issue. It is reported that Mr. Bao still needs to contact all relevant parties in Shanghai. Once everything is completed, he will return to Beijing to report back. Furthermore, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions has decided to send representatives today to meet with Mr. Bao to report on the progress of handling the electrical workers' strike.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Municipal Council Conducts Mediation</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the electrical workers' strike, various sectors, concerned about the overall social stability, have sent letters to the Shanghai Municipal Council's Board of Directors, requesting that they quickly find a way to mediate and seek a resolution as soon as possible. Upon receiving the letters, the Board immediately dispatched Chairman Feetham to visit Mr. Hopkins, the manager of the company, to conduct mediation. Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, the Shanghai Municipal Council notified the four district water and electricity trade unions to send representatives to the Council for questioning. The unions sent Mr. Xu Hongsheng. Mr. Feetham, accompanied by Council member Mr. He Dequi, received him. First, Mr. He inquired about the Chen Qinglu assassination case. The representative replied that the staff and workers were not related, and the labor side had no knowledge of Chen's death. Mr. He then informed him of Chairman Feetham's mediation with the company. It was said that the company was very dissatisfied with the workers' unannounced strike and had not agreed to accept the various demands. However, regarding the pension issue, the Shanghai Municipal Council decided to find ways to mediate further to achieve a resolution and hoped that the workers would strictly maintain order.</p>
<h3>The Social Affairs Bureau Will Question Tomorrow</h3>
<p>After the special envoy Mr. Bao Huaguo, dispatched by the Ministry of Industry, came to Shanghai and consulted with Mr. Xu Yefu, the Chief of the Third Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, on handling measures, it was decided to first convene the labor side for questioning in order to proceed with mediation. It is reported that the Social Affairs Bureau has scheduled a meeting tomorrow (the 23rd) to convene responsible representatives from the four district water and electricity trade unions to the bureau for questioning. The notification has already been issued yesterday, and Mr. Bao Huaguo will also be present.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Finance Approves the Cancellation of Special Licenses for Native Wine by the Chamber of Commerce; Absolutely No Separate Special Tax Rates Can Be Established</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce previously telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to request relief for the case of maintaining special licenses for native yellow wine operations. It is now known that the Ministry of Finance has replied to the Chamber yesterday. The original text is copied below: "Your telegram regarding the Shanghai native yellow wine special license has been received. The special license for native yellow wine is an outdated practice left over from the establishment of the public sales system. Why should the same native yellow wine be subject to half tax when sold in the concessions? Based on reason and principle, it should have been abolished long ago. This time, the change of the native wine to a fixed tax is specifically for the purpose of equalizing the burden and unified collection. All kinds of old licenses have been abolished. How can a special license alone survive? If native yellow wine is not the only kind of wine sold in the Shanghai concessions, and permission is granted to reduce the tax by half for native yellow wine production and sales, then other wine merchants in the concessions, as well as native yellow wine merchants in various provinces and ports, will argue with reason, and how can they be convinced? The merchants should think from the other's perspective and understand. In short, fairness is the principle of taxation. The Ministry is in charge of tax administration in various provinces and strives for fairness in matters. If a corner or an industry stops brewing due to a dispute over outdated practices, it is absolutely not permissible. There should be no distinction between Chinese and concession territories, and no separate special tax rates should be established, which would be a major obstacle. The request should not be discussed. You should immediately inform all merchants in the industry to comply with the new regulations and not to delay further. This approval."</p>
<h3>Disputes in the Shanghai-Hangzhou Transportation Industry; The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Mediated the Result Yesterday</h3>
<p>According to a letter from the Hangzhou Chamber of Commerce stating that the Hangzhou Transportation Industry Association opposes the establishment of five offices by the Shanghai Transportation Industry in places such as the Zhapu Gate, which are independently receiving cargo tickets and violating industry association laws, requesting a fair mediation to resolve disputes, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce convened both parties for mediation at 2:00 PM yesterday, dispatching committee member and director of the business section, Mr. Luo Qinghua. The circumstances are as follows:</p>
<h3>Mediation Situation</h3>
<p>Representatives present were: Pan Xieqing from the Hangzhou Chamber of Commerce; Jia Leshan, Chen Zaixin, Shen Wenqiao, He Huanzhang, Xuan Baozhen from the Hangzhou Transportation Industry Association; Shen Huiquan, Chen Zai Xiong, Sun Shaoqing, Ge Lai Chi, Chen Zhisun, etc., from the Shanghai Transportation Industry Public Association.

<h3>Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s Stevedore Employees' Work Slowdown Resolved; The Slowdown Lasted 24 Hours; Resumption of Work at 8:00 PM Last Night</h3>
<p>The stevedore employees of the Shanghai ships of the British firm Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. suddenly announced a slowdown at around 7:00 PM the night before last and left the ships together. All ships immediately stopped loading and unloading cargo. After the company ordered the ship compradors to negotiate, it was reported that a resolution was reached at 6:00 PM last night. The workers went on board and resumed work at 8:00 PM. The Fusheng, which was supposed to depart yesterday, was rescheduled to depart this afternoon. The circumstances are investigated and recorded below:</p>
<h3>Reasons for the Slowdown</h3>
<p>Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. operates about 18 ships on China's Yangtze River and coastal routes. The stevedore workers on each ship, about 300 people, have requested a pay raise from the compradors since last month due to the difficulty of life in order to maintain their livelihood. However, the compradors could not afford to bear the burden due to the meager salaries paid by the company. Therefore, the Maritime Mutual Aid Association took over the negotiation with the company, requesting an increase in wages so that the stevedore workers could be paid more. Unexpectedly, the company repeatedly delayed and has not resolved it yet. Negotiations have become even more tense this week. At 3:00 PM on Friday, the company verbally promised to increase 75 yuan per ship. However, there was no solid evidence. After hearing the news, the stevedores still believed that the company's move was a delaying tactic. Therefore, they convened a general meeting of representatives and decided to immediately slow down work in order to prompt the company to realize. After the decision, workers from the Northern shipping vessel Lisheng, Hesheng, the Southern shipping vessel Fusheng, and the Yangtze shipping vessel Gonghe, etc., left the ships together and implemented a slowdown. The ships were greatly affected and stopped loading and unloading cargo. However, the Yangtze route's Gonghe was scheduled to depart that night, and passengers and goods were piled up on the pier. The company sent Westerners to the ship to receive the goods, and it departed this morning. The other ships had to wait quietly for a resolution.</p>
<h3>Comprador Mediation</h3>
<p>The company believed that the stevedore's slowdown was related to the compradors' request for a pay raise. Therefore, at about 11:00 AM yesterday, it convened the compradors for a conversation and ordered them to resolve it. The compradors believed that there would be a solution if the company could agree to the conditions proposed by the workers. The company agreed to the compradors' request, and they all withdrew, agreeing to reply at 4:00 PM. At about 4:00 PM in the afternoon, Ding Sheng, Li Sheng, Xianghe, Pinghe, and other compradors returned to the company. The company appointed a Chinese staff member as a representative to go to the Maritime Workers' Union for negotiations with the compradors.</p>
<h3>Resumption of Work Last Night</h3>
<p>After the stevedore workers left the ships at about 7:00 PM the night before last and implemented a slowdown, they all stayed in hotels. Yesterday afternoon, more than 30 representatives from 18 ships went to the party and government agencies and the preparatory committee of the Chinese Maritime Workers' Union to petition and submitted a petition. The union side was received by Secretary Hou Dachun. Because the union had not been involved in the matter beforehand, it only accepted the petition and did not express its opinion. The petition also included three conditions: (1) Each stevedore employee should receive an increase of six yuan per month starting from October of this year. (2) In the event of a ship accident, in addition to handling according to maritime law, those whose annual salary is less than 650 yuan should receive no less than 650 yuan in compensation. Survivors should be compensated for losses of 160 yuan, and their occupation should be arranged first. (3) The annual double salary should be canceled and replaced with a three-day promotion per month. After the general union accepted the petition, it immediately instructed the Shanghai branch to investigate and negotiate. By 5:00 PM, the company representatives and the ship compradors arrived at the union and stated that the company would give a satisfactory reply to the conditions proposed by the workers next Tuesday. Although the workers had this good news, they had no evidence. Therefore, the representative immediately signed a note on the spot. The workers expressed satisfaction and agreed to resume work at 8:00 PM last night. The representative returned to the company to report. A slowdown that lasted 24 hours was abruptly resolved. The ships that were supposed to depart yesterday were rescheduled to depart this afternoon.</p>
<h3>Notes on Labor-Capital Disputes; The Fifth District Cigarette Workers' Union Declares Support for the Third Factory; Fulun and Shuanggong Factories Request Wage Reduction by Precedent; Western Goods Industry's Capital Side Violates Contract, Trade Union to Respond; Dyeing Industry Formally Refuses to Dye Customer Goods for Liquor Fees</h3>
<p>Recently, cases of labor-capital disputes in this city have been increasing daily. For example, the silk factories in this city once requested the Social Affairs Bureau to reduce wages due to the sluggish sales of silk in Europe and America. After the Social Affairs Bureau's mediation failed, the Fulun and Shuanggong silk factories also requested the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday to reduce wages according to precedent. Due to conditional issues, the Nanhuo industry's trade union negotiated with the trade association and scheduled a general meeting on the 28th to discuss a solution. Yesterday, workers in the silk, satin, cloth, and dyeing industries started to stop delivering and dyeing customer goods. In order to prevent cheating, the goods in the storefronts must be stamped by the trade union before they can be dyed. The Social Affairs Bureau will question tomorrow. The Fifth District Cigarette Workers' Union issued a declaration yesterday in support of the strike case of the British-American Tobacco Company's third factory, as the capital side refused to work. The details of each situation are compiled below:</p>
<h3>Request for Wage Reduction by Precedent</h3>
<p>The strike at the Tianbao Road Fulun Shuanggong Silk Factory was resolved the day before yesterday. However, the capital side believed that the wages of the Danggong silk factory had already been decided and submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau for approval to reduce them. Naturally, the Shuanggong factory family would suffer the same pain. Therefore, they also submitted a request to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday to reduce wages according to precedent. The request was for relief due to the sluggish silk market. The request stated that since the summer, when the silk market showed some activity, the wages of female workers increased with the example of the Danggong silk factory, requesting an increase to 46 cents. This was approved by your bureau. However, after entering autumn, silk sales have been sluggish, and prices have fallen, and the difficulties are the same as those of the Danggong silk factory. According to the approved wages, the factory is really unable to bear the burden. Now, the wages of the Danggong silk factory have been submitted to your bureau by the silk factory industry association for approval to reduce them. The circumstances of the factory are the same and should be handled together by your bureau so that the factory can maintain its operations, and both labor and capital can benefit, which would be a good deed. In addition, the factory's submission to the industry association is omitted.</p>
<h3>Nanhuo Capital Side Violates Contract</h3>
<p>Due to the recent arbitrary violation of the originally agreed labor-capital conditions by the capital side, employees in the Nanhuo industry in this city have caused repercussions. Yesterday, the trade union sent representatives Yu Yaoqiu, Huang Benli, Yang Shide, Jin Dongting, etc., to negotiate with the association. The chairman of the association, Gong Jingruo, and the general secretary, Yao Fenglin, received them. Regarding the violation of conditions by various stores, they agreed to convene the stores within a week to conduct mediation. The trade union, fearing that the stores would still not fulfill their obligations, has scheduled a general meeting for 2:00 PM next Monday (the 30th) to discuss countermeasures.</p>
<h3>Dyeing Industry Refuses to Dye Customer Goods for Liquor Fees</h3>
<p>Workers in the silk, satin, cloth, and dyeing industries have started to refuse to dye customer goods for the issue of liquor fees since yesterday. The Social Affairs Bureau convened a meeting at 10:00 AM yesterday morning. Because the notification from the labor side could not be delivered, they were absent and unable to proceed. The bureau has now rescheduled the meeting for 1:00 PM on the afternoon of the 30th. Fearing that the capital side would cheat in secret, the trade union has changed the collection of dyeing from storefronts and has notified all 72 dyeing shops in the city to stop it. The original text says, "Dear Sirs, All members of our office, etc., have implemented a refusal to dye customer goods for the purpose of rectifying liquor fees. During the period of refusing to dye customer goods, in order to avoid concealment, ready-made silk goods in storefronts are limited to five days. After our office, etc., sends personnel to stamp them, they can be dyed. In addition to notifying the workers in various factories, we are sending this letter to you, hoping that you will comply. Thank you."</p>
<h3>Cigarette Workers' Union Supports</h3>
<p>Due to the failure of the workers of the third factory of the British-American Tobacco Company on Taopeng Road to demand that the capital side recognize the trade union, a slowdown occurred. After being criticized by the Social Affairs Bureau and repeatedly ordered to resume work, the capital side refused, and it has not been resolved to this day. The Fifth District Cigarette Workers' Union issued a declaration yesterday in support. The original text says, "The storms in the first and second factories of British-American Tobacco Company have just subsided, and the workers of the third factory of British-American Tobacco Company are willing to support. In addition, the workers of the third factory of British-American Tobacco Company are following closely. Reading their declaration and examining the facts, the failure to pay shutdown wages, the unwarranted dismissal of workers, the refusal to allow workers to resume work, and the prohibition of collecting membership fees are exactly the same as those of the first and second factories. The third factory is located in the concession, and the factory usually oppresses workers, even more than the first and second factories. Life is so inhumane that it is difficult to describe in words. After the overall workers realized and united together, they demanded liberation, which made the factory even more jealous and hostile. The workers' suffering became more intense, forcing them to take extreme measures. There was no choice. This is why our association rushed to the rescue and did not hesitate. After the pain subsided, there was no time to grieve. Although the east and west are separated and there are divisions, lips and teeth are interdependent. How can Qin and Chu sit idly by? We swear to be a backing, remove the gap, apply this long whip, attack the horse's belly, and spray blood to write words. This is our declaration."</p>
<h3>The Taxation Administration Maintains the Case of Zero-Piece Reporting; The Cotton Cloth Association Sends a Letter Requesting Verification</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Cotton Cloth Industry Association previously sent a letter to the Taxation Administration, requesting the maintenance of the case of zero-piece reporting in order to benefit merchants and people. It has been approved in reply. The association sent a letter to each member yesterday, saying, "Dear Sirs, Your previous joint letter requested the transfer of the unified tax bureau to maintain the method of transporting cotton cloth in the original piece zero batch without a single report. This association has sent letters to the unified tax bureau, the unified tax bureau, and the yarn factory association. Now, the unified tax bureau has replied, 'According to the letter received, merchants have been transporting original pieces of cotton cloth in zero batches to various ports without a single report. Recently, it was suddenly informed verbally by a transportation company that regardless of one or two pieces, a single report must be obtained. Otherwise, the inspection offices will fine the goods. Please continue to follow the old example to facilitate the case. This will maintain the established case.' It has been handled for a long time that cotton yarn and textiles are removed from the tax-paid package and sold in zero pieces or zero packages for distribution or local wholesale resale. The various merchants are allowed to transport and sell freely without the need to provide certificates for inspection. The various merchants do not know what to rely on. In addition to ordering the unified tax bureau of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui regions to notify the inspection checkpoints to follow the case to facilitate commercial transportation, we are also replying accordingly for verification and to inform the merchants so that they can rely on it.' Etc., has been received by the association. We are also forwarding this letter to you, hoping that you will verify it. Thank you."</p>
<h3>The Wuhua Bank's Business is Developing; Mr. Fan Shaoliang is Working Hard to Manage It; Current Deposit Time Deposit is the Most Developed</h3>
<p>The Wuhua Industrial Trust Bank on Ningbo Road and the east end of Henan Road in this city has strong capital and excellent credit. Since its opening, its business has been very developed. Because its procedures are convenient and its handling is quick, there is a large crowd of people going to deposit every day. Mr. Fan Shaoliang, the manager of the bank, is also an outstanding talent in the banking industry.

Therefore, the bank's business is booming, which can be predicted.</p>
<h3>The Communist Party Suspect Case is Rescheduled for Another Hearing; The Police Have Not Yet Agreed to the Transfer</h3>
<p>The Supervisory Office of the Municipal Public Security Bureau recently learned that Li Song, a Cantonese man residing at No. 50 Yuanfu Lane, Kunming Road, Hudong, Shanghai (a teacher at San Yi Primary School), is the director of the Communist Party's Hudong District in Shanghai, whose original name is Li Aman, and lives with Zhong Dada (also a Cantonese man), a cadre of the district. Therefore, in coordination with Chen Baozhong, a Chinese detective from the Huishan Police Department, Li and Zhong were arrested at 1:50 PM on the 14th of this month and sent to the Second Branch of the High Court for interrogation and detention. This morning, Court President Yu Hua and Prosecutors Zhou and Jiang opened a criminal court for further interrogation. Lawyer Li Zhishan of the Police Department immediately stated that the Police Department had investigated No. 297 Dongyouheng Road and No. 15 Tong'an Lane, Tangshan Road, but failed to find evidence that the defendants had committed a crime. Subsequently, a Communist Party member surnamed Wang, who surrendered himself, stated that he had been working in the Communist Party and, in view of the mistakes in his previous actions, surrendered himself to the Central Committee in June of this year. Both defendants are important members of the Communist Party in the Hudong District. After the surrender, he went to the defendant's residence to arrest them but failed. The supervisor of the Public Security Bureau then requested a transfer. Lawyer Li Zhishan of the Police Department immediately stated that the points provided by Wang, the witness in this case, were completely inaccurate. Because Wang said that he had gone to the current residence of the defendants in June to arrest them, the defendants have not moved into that star for more than two months. Therefore, his confession is unreliable. Regarding the transfer point, it is difficult to agree. He requested that the date be changed to a detailed investigation to clarify the truth. Court President Yu asked the two defendants, who both denied being Communist Party members. The court then ordered that the case be rescheduled for further interrogation.</p>
<h3>The Xu Jiashi is Accused of Enticement and Abandonment Case is Continued</h3>
<p>Zhang Aina, a dance girl at the La Fei Dance Hall, is 19 years old this year. On April 28th of the old calendar this year, she was seduced by a dancer living at No. 39 Ruihua Lane, La Fei Road, a Guangdong youth and university student Xu Jiashi (22 years old) to open a room in the Shanghai Hotel and have sexual relations. Xu personally wrote a note in advance, stating that he would live together forever and never change his mind. If there were any changes, he would be willing to compensate for all losses and hand it over to the woman for safekeeping. Unexpectedly, Xu has recently fallen in love with someone else and abandoned Zhang. After the woman found Xu for theory, he avoided seeing her. Therefore, the woman's mother, Zhang Wang, as the legal guardian, accompanied the woman and hired lawyers Zhu Taiqing and Lu Wencan to file a criminal self-accusation with the Second Special District Court, accusing Xu Jiashi of enticement and abandonment, requesting investigation and attaching a civil lawsuit. The court has interrogated the case once, but the defendant claimed to be ill and went out. His defense lawyer requested a postponement. The details have been recorded in previous newspapers. Yesterday, Prosecutor Xiong Huihua opened the court for interrogation again. The self-accuser mother and daughter arrived in court with lawyers Zhu and Chen. The defendant Xu Jiashi also arrived in court with defense lawyers E Sen and Tao Jiachun for interrogation. The official asked the defendant, who said he was 19 years old and studying at school. His lawyer stated that the defendant was now filing a counterclaim against the self-accuser. Subsequently, the court announced that the case involved morals and prohibited listening. Then, the judge separately interrogated the witnesses from both the self-accuser and the defendant for a long time. As a result, he ordered that the case be rescheduled for trial and adjourned.</p>
<h3>Huang Senquan Commits Suicide by Poison; The Municipal Public Security Bureau Seeks Relatives to Claim the Body; Marital Discord Leads to Change</h3>
<p>At 11:30 PM on the 19th of last month, Zhang Guoqing, a policeman at the Haige Road Guard Post of the Second Sub-bureau of the Sixth District of the Public Security Bureau, suddenly received a report from a passerby that a young man was lying on the road at the intersection of Haige Road and Qiaodun Road. The policeman immediately went to investigate and found that the young man was over 20 years old, wearing a blue cloth student uniform, bald, with a long face, wearing red and gray socks and yellow leather shoes, lying on the west side of Haige Road at the intersection of Qiaodun Road. His teeth were clenched, and he could not speak. He found six pieces of a pencil suicide note beside him, and only then did he learn that his name was Huang Senquan and that he had committed suicide by poison. However, he still had breath in his chest. He immediately reported to the sub-bureau and relayed it to the general bureau. He hired a car to rush to the Red Cross for treatment. Because of the deep poisoning, he died at 5:00 AM on the 20th. He then ordered the local guarantor to report to the court for examination and confirmed that he died of poisoning. Because no family members claimed the body, the bureau took photos and prepared a coffin for sleeping and waiting for collection. The deceased had six suicide notes, the gist of which was that his wife was not good and therefore he was tired of the world.</p>
<h3>Murder Case of Beef Shop Owner: Police File Public Prosecution</h3>
<p>Sun Chufu, the beef shop owner of Shun Long Xing at No. 352 Qiwu Pu Road, a native of Danyang, residing at No. 20 Sanmin Fang, Yangzhou Road, on the morning of the 11th of this month, around 2 AM, was enraged that his fellow townsman, Shuai Shuchun (also known as A Mao), lingered in his shop.  He took advantage of Shuai's plan to return to his hometown and lured his concubine Ms. Chen's fifteen-year-old daughter, Guiqing, to a hotel for illicit relations.  Overcome with anger, he used the pretense of praying at a flower festival to trick Shuai to the Qiwu Pu Road wharf.  There, he used a beef-cutting knife to kill him and then pushed the body into the Huangpu River in an attempt to destroy the evidence.  The case was investigated and solved by Detective Yang Peisheng and Detectives Li Pengfei and Xie Wanfang of the Jianlin Police Station, who sent the suspect to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention.  The details have been recorded in previous reports.  Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xiecai continued the trial in the Third Criminal Court.  The police lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, stated that during the investigation, it was found that the defendant and Guiqing had engaged in physical relations when she was thirteen years old.  Ms. Chen, the concubine, found out and reprimanded him, forbidding him from such bestial behavior.  However, Sun continued to do so surreptitiously.  Ms. Chen admitted this to the police earlier and is also present in court today.  However, Guiqing has disappeared without a trace with Zhao Dafu.  The murder weapon and the incense sticks and red candles that were taken to the wharf for the flower festival prayers at the time were presented as evidence. According to Ms. Chen's statement, her maiden name is Wang, and her late husband was Chen Maomao, who passed away seven years ago.  She then became Sun's concubine and lived with him. Guiqing is Chen's daughter from her deceased husband. A Mao took advantage of the defendant's return to his hometown to lure the girl to a hotel for illicit relations.  When the defendant returned to Shanghai, I told him the situation.  He initially didn't believe it, saying that A Mao was his good friend and would never do such a thing.  Later, after discovering the truth, he killed A Mao that night. I did not know about it in advance.  The court asked if her daughter had engaged in illicit relations with the defendant. Seeing the defendant and fearing him, she dared not speak frankly and claimed that there was no such thing.  Furthermore, according to a petition submitted by the deceased's elder brother, Shuai Shugong, seeking justice, the defendant insisted that he had questioned A Mao about the girl's illicit affair, but he refused to beg for forgiveness, leading to the tragedy.  The court ordered the start of the debate.  The police lawyer, Zhang, stated that the police were filing a public prosecution under Article 284, Sections 1 and 2 of the Criminal Code for premeditated murder and dismemberment.  The deceased's head and hands were cut a total of twenty-one times, and three fingers were missing.  The lawyer witnessed the scene, which was extremely tragic.  The defendant's methods were cruel and ruthless, and he pushed the body into the Huangpu River to destroy the evidence. The court was requested to impose a very severe penalty. Judge Xiao appointed a lawyer to defend the defendant once, and then ordered him to be remanded in custody, setting a date for sentencing.</p>

<h3>Continued Trial of Dance Queen Mei Zhen's Lawsuit Against Shen Yongjun for Seduction and Abandonment. Shen Claims Wang Mei Zhen is a Prostitute. Trial Adjourned for Further Investigation and Attempted Reconciliation.</h3>
<p>Dance queen Mei Zhen, represented by lawyer Pan Zhe, sued Shen Yongjun, a student at Jiangnan College, in the First Special District Court for seduction and abandonment, demanding 50,000 silver dollars for living expenses. The details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Liu Yugui of the First Special Court continued the trial in the Second Criminal Court. Shen Yongjun appeared in court with his lawyers, Wang Weizhen and Yin Shijie. First, Wang Mei Zhen stated that the defendant was introduced to her by Shen Luoying on February 18th. They were engaged on March 5th, exchanging engagement rings. After the engagement, she was defiled by the defendant. She also abandoned her career as a dancer. Shen paid her 150 silver dollars per month for living expenses. Recently, she heard that Shen had found another lover and abandoned her like a discarded shoe, hence the lawsuit. The engagement ring had already been pawned for cash due to a lack of funds. When questioned, Shen Yongjun stated that in February of this year, he was playing with friends at the Tianyunlou amusement park in the Yong'an Company when he met the plaintiff at the entrance of the theater. At that time, Wang Mei Zhen was with an old woman. She smiled at him and asked for his help to go to her house. He followed her there. The plaintiff invited him to stay overnight, asking for fifteen dollars, but they agreed on ten dollars. From then on, the plaintiff often called him on the phone, and the nightly cost was still ten dollars. Recently, his family found out that he was prostituting himself with a prostitute and reprimanded him severely. He also regretted that as a student, he should not have engaged in such degenerate behavior. So, he disappeared. As for the engagement mentioned by the plaintiff, it was entirely fabricated. Furthermore, he was in mourning for his parents, so how could he wear a gold ring as an engagement ring? In short, the plaintiff is a prostitute. He doesn't know if she is a dancer or not. Judge Liu reviewed the statements and adjourned the case for further hearing, ordering the two parties to attempt a reconciliation outside of court.</p>
<h3>Kidnapping Case Occurred on Avenue Joffre Yesterday Afternoon. Middle School Student Kidnapped, Chauffeur Injured.</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 21st) at approximately 11:15 AM, a kidnapping of a young St. John's Middle School student occurred near the Yangjingbang Bridge on Avenue Joffre in western Shanghai. The details are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Student Returning Home</h3>
<p>The kidnapped victim is named Wu Zhijiu, 15 years old, a local resident who has been studying at St. John's Middle School in the YMCA Alley for almost two years. Because his home is too far away, he lives at the school. He returns home every Saturday for a day of rest and goes back to school on Monday.</p>
<h3>Suddenly Kidnapped</h3>
<p>The chauffeur, Shen Er, drove to the school gate to pick him up at around 10 AM. Wu Zhijiu, wearing a dark blue woolen gown and a student cap, left the school and got into the car. Because his older sister, Guiyi, is studying at the Zhongxi Women's School on Yidingpan Road and needed to be picked up as well, the chauffeur, Shen Er, drove west, intending to take a detour via Route Tenant de la Tour. Unexpectedly, when they had just reached the Yangjingbang Bridge on Avenue Joffre, they suddenly saw a bamboo ladder with a red flag stuck in it lying across the road. Shen stopped the car slightly. Suddenly, four bandits rushed forward. Three were wearing blue short coats and each held a handgun. One was wearing black clothes and spoke with a Shanghai accent. They rushed into the car. Two bandits sat on either side of Wu, one restrained the chauffeur, and the other drove the car quickly, kidnapping the student and heading north towards Sun Yat-sen Road.</p>
<h3>Chauffeur Injured</h3>
<p>After the four bandits kidnapped the victim and drove away, they covered the chauffeur, Shen Er, with a copper basin and a woolen hat, tied him up with rope, and punched him in the head, face, back, and waist. When the car reached near No. 4 Bridge, Lujiazhai on Sun Yat-sen Road, they stopped the car slightly. Two bandits forcibly lifted Shen up and threw him from the car onto the open ground by the roadside. The car then headed north. Shen was seriously injured and fell unconscious to the ground.</p>
<h3>Chauffeur Rescued</h3>
<p>At approximately 12 PM, the chauffeur, Shen Er, regained some consciousness and faintly called for help. At that time, a small worker from the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company was working on Sun Yat-sen Road. More than ten workers heard the call and went to see. They saw Shen lying on the ground, unable to speak and unable to move. Knowing that he was seriously injured, the worker, Zhang Linsen, helped him up and sent him to the Sixth District Police Station to report. After Shen was taken to the hospital for treatment, he was brought back to the district. According to the doctor, Shen's brain was seriously injured.</p>
<h3>Car Found</h3>
<p>After taking the medicine, Shen's mind cleared slightly. According to Shen, he is 38 years old, from Haimen, and has been working as a driver for the Wu family since November of last year. He usually picks up and drops off the young master at school. Shortly after the young master was kidnapped, he heard the young master say to the bandits in the car, "You must be mistaken." The bandit replied, "We are not mistaken. If we are wrong, we will send you back." He didn't know what else was said because he was knocked unconscious by the bandits. According to worker Zhang Linsen, we were working on Sun Yat-sen Road and saw Shen lying injured on the ground. We didn't know how he was injured, so we hired a car to send him to report. After receiving the report, the district used the telephone to notify all districts, asking them to pay attention to and investigate the car. At 10:50 PM that afternoon, the car with license plate number 6440 was discovered near the shooting range in Hongkou Park on Jiangwan Road. The Dixiwei Road Police Station notified the Fifth District Headquarters, which informed the Sixth District, ordering the car owner to take it back. At the same time, the police stations and police departments searched the car for clues. According to various speculations, it is feared that the kidnappers are still hiding nearby, so the investigators from all sides were out last night to pursue the investigation.</p>
<h3>Report on a Visit to the Shanghai National Products Company. Declaration of Preparation for the Second Plan Announced.</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the reporter saw the Shanghai National Products Company opposite the Jade Buddha Temple on Nanjing Road, holding a large 21-day anniversary sale. The facilities were well-equipped, the advertisements were novel, and the customers who loved national products were really in the thousands. They came with money and left fully loaded, and their faces were very happy and satisfied. This shows the enthusiasm of the people for using national products and proves that there is still hope for the future. The reporter wanted to understand whether the products they sell are all national products, so he also went inside to visit and interview them. The content is recorded below, to inform those who are concerned about national products. The founders are famous Shanghai figures Wu Zhihao and Lu Qisheng, etc. The designers are also famous Shanghai figures Ren Jinlan and Zhu Dechao. The advertising designer is the artist Zhu Weiyue, and the national goods toy expert Yang Liangbi was running around arranging the place. There were also several female employees participating in the plan, so it could be done perfectly. When asked about the national products, they said that they were all from Chinese manufacturers. When asked how many categories there were, they said there were more than forty-four. When asked about the business situation in the past year, they said it was more than 2.4 million yuan. When asked how many national products companies there were in Shanghai and who was the first to establish one, they said that there are only two large companies on Nanjing Road that purely deal in national products, namely the Shanghai National Products Company and the China National Products Company, and the Shanghai National Products Company was the first to establish one. When asked if foreign goods stores disguise foreign goods as Chinese goods, they said that they are responsible and will never be involved in this suspicion, because all the products are from national manufacturers, and they all have registered trademarks and certificates from the National Products Manufacturers Association, which can be used as proof. When asked what characteristics make buyers satisfied, they said that the company buys all the goods with cash and, to the extent possible, advances money to national products manufacturers, which is called prepayment in society. Because of this prepayment, the purchase price is low, so the price of each product is also cheap. The company wants to promote national products to compete with foreign goods and open up a new path for national products, creating a new record of small profits and quick sales. This is the characteristic of the Shanghai National Products Company. The reporter had a general understanding of the content after asking these questions, so he bid farewell and returned. He was happy to record this because the company's operation of national products benefits the country, so he hopes to promote it.</p>
<h3>Shanghai National Products Company Prepares a Declaration for its Second Plan</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai National Products Company, located opposite the Jade Buddha Temple on Nanjing Road, announced the implementation of its expansion plan, it has achieved satisfactory results on the first day. Recently, because the company held its first anniversary celebration, Mr. Lu Qisheng, the person in charge of the company, decided to prepare a second plan at the anniversary meeting and shortened the completion period of the expansion plan. The declaration for the preparation of the second plan has already been drafted, and the following is a transcript: "The ancient sages who discussed revenge said that a gentleman takes three years to avenge himself, and that 'ten years of gathering strength and ten years of education.' These are all instructions from the ancients for self-reliance and effective results. The past year has seen calls for self-reliance throughout the country, but they have not helped the national crisis. Not only have they not helped the national crisis, but they have also increased the humiliation. The reason is that people's hearts are driven by greed, and they harm each other through mutual jealousy and lack of cooperation. We will not discuss politics for now, but if we discuss society and industry and commerce, there are those who buy and sell inferior goods for profit, and those who supervise enemy goods and use their power for their own selfish ends. Patriotic people hate and sigh because they think that national affairs cannot be done. Can the country really not be done? It is not that it cannot be done, but that it is not done. In short, the recent events of this company are enough to serve as evidence. In October of last year, Mr. Wu Zhihao, the founder of this company, was preparing to establish the company. Someone advised Mr. Wu Zhihao that it would not be easy to break through and fight back against foreign goods on Nanjing Road. Mr. Wu resolutely replied, 'If you don't do it because it is not easy, then there will never be a time when it is easy. If you really don't do it, it is because you are afraid of difficulties and are willing to be fish meat.' Now that the company has been established for a year, we can further realize from the recent implementation of the expansion plan that the country can be done if the Chinese people have the spirit of self-respect and self-encouragement and can fight to break through the national crisis for the country and the nation. The current expansion plan of this company was originally scheduled to be prepared in August of this year, starting from September 1st to the end of February next year as the completion period, and a planned monthly sales target was set as the standard for the objectives to be achieved. The work that has been done in the plan is only 10%, and the time used in the plan is only 2/6. The result of the first month's sales has exceeded the standard target by 13.33%, and the sales in the second month are predicted to exceed 20% as of yesterday. It can be seen that the hearts of the people have not completely died, and if they can fight for the country, they will definitely have enthusiastic help. Based on this belief, it was decided at the anniversary meeting to shorten the deadline for the implementation of the expansion plan, with the end of December of this year as the completion period, and to implement the currently prepared second plan starting from January 1st next year. But the reason why this company has this courage and this spirit is all due to the encouragement of the ladies who love to buy national goods, and knowing that those who are self-reliant will definitely help each other. Therefore, the more encouragement there is in the future, the more vigorous the spirit of self-reliance will be, and those who rise up together to fight for the country will not be cut off along the way. It can be seen that today's China does not need to wait for gathering strength, but only needs to teach, nurture, and encourage them, and make them do it diligently. This company is grateful for the success of the past and cannot but make a sincere announcement on the day of preparing the first plan, wishing that patriotic ladies would know that this company can fight for the country, and from the concept of self-rescue and benefiting the country, increase its power of assistance, so that this economic self-defense barrier can continue to play its role indefinitely, and also make patriotic people know that the matter of wiping out shame and saving the country is not impossible. This declaration is hereby made for your review."</p>
<h3>Concert by the Shanghai Municipal Council Orchestra Tonight</h3>
<p>At 9:15 tonight, the Shanghai Municipal Council Orchestra will perform its third concert at the Grand Theatre. The program for this concert includes (1) Bach's French Suite in C Major, (2) Five Sonatas by Scarlatti, (3) Symphony in C Minor by Mozart, (4) Respighi's Fountains of Rome, and (5) Three Dances from "The Three-Cornered Hat" by Falla.</p>
<p>Bach was the founder of modern music. His works inherited the legacy of ancient music, created new-style intervals, and pioneered the sound of modern music. His contribution to the history of Western music is very great. His French Suite has long been popular and is truly one of his most successful works. Mozart's Symphony in C Minor was completed in 1788. He died young at the end of his life. It was a great loss to the music world. Respighi is the leader of modern Italian composers. He is good at musical sketches. Falla is from Andalusia in Spain. He studied at the Paris Conservatory in his youth. The characteristic of his works is that they use a lot of pizzicato music, so critics often say that he does not get rid of Eastern colors. Andalusia was occupied by Arabs and Moors in the Middle Ages. Although the locals later drove them away, their customs and habits were still passed down to the local area, so the music there has also become a special genre that is very different from the world. Looking at the above programs, they gather the essence of music from four countries and showcase the masterpieces of various ancient and modern schools. The performance will be excellent and can be anticipated.</p>
<h3>Biography of Wu Zhihao</h3>
<p>Ru Xin recorded the biography of Mr. Wu Zhihao. Fenghua has three outstanding figures, and Mr. Wu Zhihao is one of them. He was unusually intelligent as a child. At the age of twelve, he studied at the Huaiyin Academy and was able to recite the classics of history and read widely, so he was regarded as a child prodigy at the time. He was generous and open-minded. He often said that a great man should be involved in society to make a contribution to the country. At the age of sixteen, his father passed away, so he inherited his father's legacy and went into business, making it his responsibility to promote national goods and improve silk fabrics. Seeing that the domestic industry was depressed and the economy was backward, he founded more than ten silk, leather goods, clothing stores and other businesses in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, trying his best to maintain national production, resist imports, and strive hard, not hesitating to sacrifice himself. His perseverance is admirable. In 1920, Mr. Wu saw that Shanghai citizens paid huge taxes every year, but did not have the citizens' rights they deserved. He ran around calling for help and did not spare any effort. Today, the Shanghai Municipal Council has the participation of Chinese directors. Mr. Wu's contribution is also undeniable. Mr. Wu has a patriotic heart and is especially happy to engage in charitable undertakings. He has extraordinary ambitions and a desire to help the poor and the needy. When there are floods, droughts, or wars, he always engages in relief efforts. In 1926, seeing that there were many poor and helpless people in his hometown, he initiated the Ningbo Seven Counties Orphanage, where more than 400 elderly and young people are educated and cared for. All of this is thanks to Mr. Wu. As for water conservancy, forests, schools, roads, and anything else he is asked for, he always generously donates and does his best to help. Mr. Wu has a grand vision of promoting national goods to save the country, believing that the development of national goods is related to the rise and fall of the country. If we want to seek a strong country, we must promote national goods, and to promote national goods, we must work together and cooperate in all aspects so that consumers can get full convenience, so that everyone will be happy to buy national goods, and national goods will begin to flourish. Therefore, he founded the Shanghai National Products Company. Now there is also the organization of the China National Products Production and Sales Joint Company, which is even larger in scale, to realize the ambition of promoting national goods. He also established the Ningbo Industrial Bank to develop various industries in agricultural and industrial areas. Mr. Wu is now fifty years old and has served as a member of the National Chamber of Commerce, a member of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the president of the Shanghai Business Federation, a director of the Ningbo Shanghai Native Place Association, and the president of the Fenghua Native Place Association. He does not shirk his responsibilities and does his best in his duties. He does not want to privately acquire land. All of his undertakings benefit the country and society. He once said to people, "What is taken from society should still be used by society." These words are true. Mr. Wu is truly a great man. Now, on the occasion of the first anniversary of the Shanghai National Products Company founded by Mr. Wu, we have compiled Mr. Wu's deeds to serve as a model for those who come after.</p>
<h3>Biography of Lu Qisheng</h3>
<p>Sun Mingqi wrote Lu Qisheng's biography, saying that Yu has known Mr. Lu Qisheng for many years. Mr. Lu is from Shangyu, Zhejiang. He is sincere and diligent by nature, and is known among his peers for his ability to handle affairs. When he serves the public, he abides by the law and progresses step by step. When he serves the business, he manages both internal and external affairs with humility and respect. Mr. Lu is a member of the Tongmenghui. During the Wuchang Uprising in 1911, Mr. Lu and Chen Yingshang responded in Shanghai. His contribution was great. Mr. Lu is now a member of the Kuomintang. He has a deep belief in the Three Principles of the People. When our party governed Guangdong Province, Mr. Lu gathered his comrades and worked hard to promote the merchant movement, leading revolutionary merchants in Shanghai, such as the All-Road Business Federation and the Chinese Taxpayers Association. Mr. Lu participated in them and did not give up his ambition. When the Party army settled in Shanghai, Mr. Lu served in the Shanghai Municipal Party Department. At that time, there were many different opinions, and the Party's foundation was not stable. Mr. Lu promoted it vigorously. Mr. Lu and his efforts have helped the Shanghai merchants to support the revolution until now without slacking off. He then served as a disciplinary committee member of the Shanghai Business Association, working diligently and never taking a break. By the time the Third National Congress opened, the long-pending merchant organization needed a unified method. Mr. Lu submitted a memorial and his suggestions were adopted. Afterwards, the Shanghai business entities merged to form an organization. The central government appointed Mr. Lu as one of the reorganization committee members of the Shanghai Merchant Association. After the establishment of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, he was elected as a supervisory committee member and a standing committee member of the Coal Industry Association. When the January 28 Incident in Shanghai occurred, Mr. Lu was indignant at the enemy's arrogance. Not only did he pay taxes, but he also led the militia to participate in the battle. When the Sino-Japanese Agreement was concluded, Mr. Lu believed that in order to achieve national prosperity, it was necessary to promote national goods first. Therefore, he and Mr. Wu Zhihao founded the Shanghai National Products Company. Over the past year, business has been growing day by day. National goods, which were previously unnoticed, have had the opportunity to sell well, and successive followers have emerged. Now, on Nanjing Road, there are the China National Products Company and the Shanghai Bargain Market, which are succeeding one another. Mr. Lu's guiding role is especially not to be forgotten.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To Whom It May Concern,</p>
<p>We have just received a communication from the owner of the Xinda Steamboat of the Sijing Tongli Steamboat Company, stating that they were greatly astonished to read in the local news section of the 19th of this month's Shen Bao that the Xinda Steamboat, which travels from Xujiahui in western Shanghai to Qibao and Sijing, suddenly capsized near Hongqiao Town. After investigation, we have found that our steamboat has been operating steadily and quickly since it started service, and no such incident has occurred. We believe that someone is deliberately slandering us, and this matter concerns the reputation of our steamboat. We have entrusted your esteemed lawyer to send a letter to request a correction to clarify the truth and respect the facts. We hereby send this special letter to your newspaper, requesting that this letter be published as a correction. We respectfully wish you well.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Lawyer Gu Wenwei (Office: 39 Avenue Edward VII, Telephone 85082)</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>A Disagreeable End to the Free Talk</h3>
<p>— Lu Zi</p>
<p>Crooked-Mouth Si is a "Biexiang Ren" (a person with a special skill or trade), and Little Scabby is also a "Biexiang Ren." Although they both make a living by stirring up trouble,</p>
<p>the "Biexiang" rice of extortion and denial, each has its own "territory" and each has its own "clients,"</p>
<p>so they can all "mind their own business" and not interfere with each other.</p>
<p>But if Crooked-Mouth Si "doesn't know his place" and goes to Little Scabby's "territory"</p>
<p>to "make some extra money" without even saying hello, then, for the sake of "face," Little Scabby will naturally not let it go and will have to</p>
<p>give Crooked-Mouth Si some "color." The so-called "color" means clenching fists, flexing arms, and grabbing collars</p>
<p>to start a fight.</p>
<p>In such a fistfight, logically, the one who is lying down and being beaten is considered the loser, but</p>
<p>it is not so in the "Biexiang Ren world." Even if the opponent beats you until your head is bloody, when you get up from the ground</p>
<p>and run away, dusting off your behind, you still have to shout, "If you have the guts, meet me at the Huxin Pavilion at ten o'clock tomorrow!" That means,</p>
<p>"If you're a real man, meet me at the Huxin Pavilion at ten o'clock tomorrow for a 'tea talk.'"</p>
<p>In the "Biexiang Ren world," if you are invited to a "tea talk" and don't go, you can forget about having the "face" to eat</p>
<p>"Biexiang Ren rice" in the future. So when the time comes, both sides' "elders," "brothers from the same womb," and "apprentices"</p>
<p>will all gather together, young and old, and then they will argue furiously about their "principles."</p>
<p>If the "principles" are resolved smoothly, the "elders" of both sides will take charge and "call it off," and everyone will no longer "hold this matter in their hearts" and will be reconciled as before.</p>
<p>If it "cannot be called off," then one side will propose conditions and ask the other side to prepare wine to "smooth things over." This naturally implies that there is right and wrong involved.</p>
<p>If the wrong party is willing to apologize, then everything will be fine. If the wrong party is unwilling, then everyone will</p>
<p>end up without a resolution, and the meeting will end on a sour note.</p>
<p>After a disagreeable end, both sides will rush to prepare "iron rulers," "small axes," "handguns," and "Mauser pistols" to carry out the final means of "doing" or "overthrowing."</p>
<p>If it results in a murder, "opening a pier," or "facing a lawsuit," then it is considered "having guts" and "having face,"</p>
<p>and you will be a true "Biexiang Ren."</p>
<p>For the sake of the "dispute over Fengao," the "European War" was triggered, and the "League of Nations" was established to negotiate "war debts" and "arms reduction," and</p>
<p>"Germany withdrew from the League." Today, it has reached the point where the "tea talk" of the Biexiang Ren "ends on a sour note." Then, the work ahead</p>
<p>is naturally only to prepare "iron rulers" and "small axes" and carry out the "I'm going to take your life" move.</p>
<h3>Social Butterfly</h3>
<p>— Zuo Yun</p>
<p>Socializing is the greatest tool for one's career.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, almost everyone is studying</p>
<p>its methods and functions. For example, what kind of socializing is needed</p>
<p>for a certain career to succeed? What kind of socializing is needed</p>
<p>to achieve the purpose of a certain pleasure? Socializing is so</p>
<p>closely related to everyone that it is</p>
<p>valued by everyone. A man who is good at socializing is</p>
<p>praised as a "socialite" or "socializing doctor." A woman who is good at</p>
<p>socializing is praised as a "social butterfly."</p>
<p>Now I want to talk about this social butterfly.</p>
<p>We need to study how social butterflies are formed. The</p>
<p>formation of a social butterfly requires the following conditions:</p>
<p>First, she must be a daughter of a prominent family with wealth; second,</p>
<p>she must be beautiful and eloquent; third, she must have a</p>
<p>free and lively personality. With the above conditions, her dress will</p>
<p>be fashionable, and her demeanor will be moving. There is also an</p>
<p>important reason: most of the time, her family already has</p>
<p>a social environment. For example, a certain social butterfly is used to running around with her</p>
<p>older brother, and another social butterfly has made a name for herself by running around with her</p>
<p>older sister. After a social butterfly is formed like this,</p>
<p>her words and actions will show her</p>
<p>characteristics.</p>
<p>She looks very young and doesn't understand anything, but</p>
<p>her conversations contain experience, and everything</p>
<p>she says expresses experience. Whether standing up or sitting down,</p>
<p>walking or stopping, she has a kind of skillful and mature</p>
<p>posture, revealed in her lively body. She is not shy.</p>
<p>In front of strangers, she will try her best to show off her wealth,</p>
<p>making you feel her extraordinary qualities and giving you a secret</p>
<p>admiration. That is her success.</p>
<p>Therefore, social butterflies are welcomed everywhere because</p>
<p>they have welcoming smiles and even more attentive responses.</p>
<p>With her around, the whole room is full of life. But social butterflies</p>
<p>need to be in contact with people, so she cannot stay at home</p>
<p>for a long time. Loneliness and solitude are what she</p>
<p>cannot tolerate the most. Happy scenes and lively</p>
<p>places are what she likes to attend the most. Social figures, in order</p>
<p>to cater to their psychology, need</p>
<p>social butterflies as bridesmaids at weddings, and they need social butterflies</p>
<p>to make guest appearances at performances or rehearsals. They also need social butterflies to</p>
<p>promote tea dances. Because most social butterflies are talented,</p>
<p>they are familiar with everything and willing to try everything. Naturally,</p>
<p>they are skilled in every kind of entertainment.</p>
<h3>Crying for Guo Hou'an Requires Silence</h3>
<p>— Li Yingong</p>
<p>The old country has sunk, overgrown with thorns, geese carry mournful tidings from the Three Qin Regions.</p>
<p>What use is it to talk of farming and planting trees? I cannot see the people with calloused hands and feet.</p>
<p>Since Tongguan was lost, the forests have not been repaired, the wind and sun have ravaged the produce,</p>
<p>How can Heaven be so cruel, to allow the plague to unleash its rampant power.</p>
<h3>Four Northeast Company Commanders</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 17: Who Can Be Without Remorse? Family Thoughts Rise from the Ashes. Soldiers Are Never Tired of Deception. Heroic Words Strengthen the Morale of the Army.</p>
<p>Zhao Ziqiang glanced at the window and turned his head to see a platoon leader passing by. He</p>
<p>smiled and said to him: Platoon Leader Liu, your company commander is really happy. Even when he's so busy,</p>
<p>he still has time to sing operas. Have all the matters been taken care of? Platoon Leader Liu said: Mostly, yes.</p>
<p>Zhao Ziqiang sighed and nodded, saying: This is the benefit of not having family.</p>
<p>When Platoon Leader Liu suddenly heard him explain it like this, he didn't quite understand. He just stared at him</p>
<p>in a daze. He realized that he had said something wrong and laughed, saying: It's a long story. If your company commander is free,</p>
<p>I'll talk to you about it, and you'll understand. Then,</p>
<p>he smiled and returned to the company. When he arrived at the company headquarters, Sergeant Wang Shili greeted him: Is the company commander going back?</p>
<p>Zhao Ziqiang shook his head, but didn't answer his question. Wang Shili saw his</p>
<p>situation and knew that he was extremely frustrated, so he didn't ask any further questions. Indeed, with this, Zhao Ziqiang</p>
<p>changed his attitude and didn't want to go home at all, but instead managed the affairs in the camp. By six</p>
<p>o'clock in the evening, the two platoon leaders had already returned. At this time, it was impossible to leave the camp, so naturally</p>
<p>it was called off. The next morning at six o'clock, he had just gotten out of bed when the attendant soldier came in and said,</p>
<p>The regimental commander is calling a meeting of the company commanders. As soon as Zhao Ziqiang heard this, he knew that the departure would be announced.</p>
<p>There was still more than half a day before the deadline for completing preparations. Again, there was more to say. This matter was truly</p>
<p>pressing one step at a time. Seeing this, it was indeed in line with Tian Qing's words: It was definitely going to the front line.</p>
<p>Going to the front line was certainly not something to be afraid of, but in this tense</p>
<p>situation, it was very distressing to suddenly leave his elderly father and his</p>
<p>lover and go to face this danger with his eyes open. He couldn't feel at ease in his heart. Loving</p>
<p>the country was something that everyone should do. But looking at it from the perspective of fighting a war, it seemed that</p>
<p>loving the country was something that only soldiers should do. No, it wasn't that soldiers should bear this responsibility,</p>
<p>but rather that people from the regimental commander down should bear this responsibility. He thought this way,</p>
<p>very absentmindedly, looking outside the room. (219)</p>
<h3>Suing the Ground</h3>
<p>— Hutou</p>
<p>"Having been a beggar for three years, you wouldn't be happy even if you were asked to be an official." This is a common</p>
<p>saying that you often hear: because begging doesn't require any special skills, and you can</p>
<p>make money, and it comes very easily. After being a beggar for three</p>
<p>years, you get used to being lazy, and doing anything</p>
<p>feels more difficult than begging, so you'd rather live a life of begging from door to door.</p>
<p>There are several ways to beg: going from house to house,</p>
<p>calling out to ladies and gentlemen to ask for money, is one way; running behind</p>
<p>rickshaws to ask for money, is another way; helping rickshaws</p>
<p>cross bridges to ask for money, is another way; pretending to have rotten feet and rotten hands, sitting in a fixed</p>
<p>place, waiting for benefactors, is another way; writing short</p>
<p>sentences on the cement floor with white powder, talking about recent</p>
<p>hardships and the reasons for falling into this situation, hoping</p>
<p>that passersby will read the words and give alms, is another</p>
<p>way. ... Among these begging methods, the first, second, and third</p>
<p>are the most difficult to make money from. At most, you can get a penny, which is already considered</p>
<p>lucky. If you want to beg for a dollar, you don't know how many steps you have to run! The fourth and fifth are relatively easier,</p>
<p>but the fourth is a bitter-flesh tactic. You make your hands or feet</p>
<p>bloody, and when ignorant men and women going to pilgrimage see it,</p>
<p>they are moved with compassion and give alms. The fifth kind of</p>
<p>begging is called suing the ground. Some also have some small skills,</p>
<p>being able to write a good hand, or even being able to write a few sentences in both Chinese and Western languages. Some are even more refined beggars, who can</p>
<p>hum a few nonsensical poems. Passersby, benevolent gentlemen,</p>
<p>read the words and poems, and, without realizing it,</p>
<p>are moved by the idea of cherishing talent, and then give alms willingly.</p>
<p>Indeed, there are real people who do this.</p>
<p>Among the five types of begging above, it is said that suing the ground is the most profitable.</p>
<p>It is not uncommon to make one or two dollars a day.</p>
<p>However, these people don't have any spare money because the reason they have fallen into this situation</p>
<p>is mostly due to opium addiction. If they make more today, they spend more; if they make less, they spend less.</p>
<p>They spend as they come, and don't think about any ways to save up, so</p>
<p>they are poor all their lives.</p>
<h3>Poems on Returning North — Scenes in Beijing and Shanghai</h3>
<p>The scenery of Jiangnan is still the same. Children on the backs of oxen use willow branches as whips.</p>
<p>Bamboo hats, zongzi (rice dumplings), and movies are all things of the outside world. Full of brambles and huts, the water glistens on the edge.</p>
<p>The clear sky is free of impurities. On a good day, the idle people also work the fields.</p>
<p>Looking back is unbearable towards Hebei. The sky and earth are desolate, and the smoke of war rises.</p>
<p>Scenes in the Jinpu Train</p>
<p>The flowing rivers and plains rotate in my mind. The momentum is like ten thousand horses going downhill.</p>
<p>Axes and hatchets cut down the mountains every day, making them bald. The floods flow back into the rivers, and the roads are naturally clear.</p>
<p>The newspapers in the north and south worry about the peeling paint. I am fortunate to have peace of mind to eat and sleep at dawn and dusk.</p>
<p>The market people seem to be comforting the traveler's suffering, competing to sell cherries around the post station.</p>
<p>Going North</p>
<p>To where does North China need to stand out? I packed my bags hastily as if going on a suburban outing.</p>
<p>Leaning on the saddle, I am surprised that my thighs are so fleshy. When talking across the barrier, I regret losing direction. I am not willing to be an old pedant.</p>
<p>I dare to hope that we will share the same hatred for the enemy. From now on, in the waves of humanity, I will go with the wind like a seagull.</p>
<p>In recent years, I have made a new spring in Jiangzuo (Jiangnan). Talented people with black hair are all becoming dignitaries.</p>
<p>The Han people do not forget that Heaven has a number. The Song Pavilion wants to seize dreams...</p>
<p>I am afraid to hear people call me "senior" while I am not yet old. The younger generation is ultimately to be feared. I pray every day to see the recovery of China in my lifetime.</p>
<p>Do not trouble the ancestral sacrifices to report peace (Shi Sun).</p>

<h3>The Municipal Government and Municipal Party Headquarters Held a Banquet Yesterday for the City Delegation; Mayor Wu, Tong Xingbai, and Others Gave Welcoming Speeches; Parade in the Afternoon with Triumphant Songs Played Along the Way</h3>
<p>The city delegation, which won the men's and women's overall championships at this year's National Games, returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday. Yesterday noon, the municipal government and municipal party headquarters specially held a banquet at the new municipal building for all staff and athletes, and invited representatives from the municipal bureaus, the Garrison Command, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the Municipal Security Office to accompany them. The Municipal Education Bureau specially prepared three buses at the end of North Sichuan Road in Hongkou to transport guests to and from the banquet. At 2:00 PM in the afternoon, they also took a bus parade to celebrate. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Banquet Attendees</h3>
<p>The attendees of yesterday's grand banquet included Shen Siliang, the chief of the city delegation, Chen Bai, the general secretary, and more than 200 staff and athletes; Jiang Qun, the chief of staff of the Garrison Command, Wen Jiangang, the head of the adjutant's office, Wang Xiaolai, the chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Zeng Zesheng, the deputy director of the Municipal Security Office, Pan Gongzhan, the director of the Education Bureau, Wen Hongen, the director of the Public Security Bureau, Shen Yi, the director of the Public Works Bureau, Zhou Feicheng, the executive director of the Municipal Education Association, and representatives from all walks of life. Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Li Dachao, Zhang Tingrong, and Geng Xiji of the municipal government; Tong Xingbai, Cai Hongtian, Wu Xiu, and Wang Manyun of the municipal party headquarters; Ma Chonggan and Wu Baojin of the Municipal Education Bureau, and others personally served as hosts.</p>
<h3>Banquet Grandeur</h3>
<p>The banquet began at 1:00 PM in the large dining hall of the new municipal building. After taking their seats, Mayor Wu and Tong Xingbai of the municipal party headquarters gave welcoming speeches. Then, Wang Xiaolai of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce gave a speech, and finally, Shen Siliang, the chief of the delegation, gave a speech of thanks on behalf of the delegation. During the banquet, General Secretary Chen Bai introduced Qian Hangsu, the female athlete who broke the most records, to Mayor Wu, who shook her hand to express his congratulations. The athletes also showed their handbooks and asked the mayor to sign them. The banquet ended at 2:00 PM and was followed by a photo session.</p>

<h3>Mayor Wu's Speech</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu first gave a welcoming speech, stating that the Shanghai team's participation in the National Games and winning the men's and women's overall championships was one of the most glorious pages in the city's history. At a time when China is in the process of revolution, building a new China, and the most intense stage of the national rejuvenation movement, it has encountered an unprecedented national crisis, which has caused all undertakings to suffer setbacks. The people across the country are in pain every day, which is a major loss for the country. However, we believe that the deeper the pain and the greater the loss, the more our old ways will be tested. As the saying goes, "Adversity strengthens a nation," which is what this means. The future life of the Chinese nation is entirely entrusted to the youth of China today. The National Games is a step in training the youth. The people of Shanghai have placed great hope on the athletes of Shanghai this time, so today they are celebrating the victory with great joy for the future of the nation. However, the purpose of your participation in the National Games is not to win medals, but to extend the life of the Chinese nation. To rejuvenate the nation and build a new China, everyone must have the ability, and ability comes from learning and experience. To cultivate knowledge and experience, one must first have a flexible mind and a sound body. The purpose of your participation in the National Games is to train a sound body, so that you can use your brain and enrich your ability to build a new China and extend the life of the Chinese nation. We have endless hope for the future of Chinese youth when we see the Shanghai athletes return with victory, and we cannot help but celebrate the future of the nation. Therefore, today's celebration of victory is also a celebration of the Chinese nation, he said.</p>
<h3>Tong Xingbai's Speech</h3>
<p>Next, Tong Xingbai of the municipal party headquarters gave a welcoming speech, stating that your ability to live up to your mission in attending this National Games shows that you all have a spirit of hard work and struggle, and I am deeply impressed. However, after analyzing this year's athletes, most of them are athletes, and there are very few participants from all walks of life, which is a pity. Sports are a symbol of national education and not a game for a certain class. They must be able to penetrate into the people so that sports have the meaning of national culture to be considered successful. I hope that you will encourage the general public from this spiritual and formal encouragement, so that Shanghai athletes will participate in all walks of life in the future, completing the meaning of education and national culture, he said.</p>
<h3>Wang Xiaolai's Speech</h3>
<p>Wang Xiaolai of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce gave a speech, saying that he was very honored to participate in today's grand event. All sectors of Shanghai have gained glory from the victory of the athletes this time. Shanghai is the first city in China, and it would be quite embarrassing if the Shanghai team could not get first place. Therefore, it is not easy to be a Shanghainese. Now that the country is in crisis, this national crisis has given us the lesson that enjoying pleasure and losing one's body is the way to destroy the country, and that we should work hard to protect our body to save the country. Finally, Shen Siliang's reply is omitted.</p>
<h3>Parade Celebration</h3>
<p>At 1:00 PM in the afternoon, all staff and athletes paraded to celebrate. Mayor Wu led the way in a car, followed by seven large trucks carrying the athletes. Each truck carried small flags, and the trucks were decorated with bright slogans such as "Triumph" and "Indeed Won the Championship." The parade cars with the slogan "Diligent and Dedicated Bureau" were even more colorful with red slogans. The directors of the municipal bureaus and the members of the municipal party headquarters followed in small cars. Starting from the city center, the parade passed through North Sichuan Road, Nanjing Road, Avenue Joffre, Gaohua Road, Minguo Road, and finally dispersed at Heping Road in the West Gate. Along the way, the athletes played triumphant songs, and the spectators on both sides of the road formed a sea of people, applauding and welcoming them. It was truly an unprecedented grand event.</p>
<h3>Lu Athletes Return to Jinan; Ji, Ping, and Jin Teams Pass Jinan and Go North</h3>
<p>(Jinan, 21st) The Lu athletes returned to Jinan tonight, and the Ji, Ping, and Jin teams are said to have passed Jinan and gone north.</p>

<p>(Nanjing, 21st) The Beijing Municipal Government has scheduled a meeting on the 23rd to welcome the winning athletes who participated in the National Games, and to distribute personal badges to the scoring athletes.</p>

<h3>The National Games and the Press: Written After the Conclusion of the National Games, Hoping for Improvements Next Time</h3>
<p>— Ma Yinliang</p>
<p>The National Games this time has left a very deep impression on us in the press. We believe that the purpose of the National Games is to promote national sports, especially in this time of national crisis, it is even more important to improve the national physical strength. To achieve this goal, the press has the most important mission of publicity. Therefore, since we received the news of the meeting, we have put all our strength into helping, both in terms of special qualities and spirit. We believe that this kind of work is indirectly for the National Games and for the government, and directly for the people of the country. But our efforts have disappointed us.</p>
<p>In order to achieve the goal of promoting national sports, we have two requirements: first, the convenience of newspaper transportation and postal and telegraphic transmission; second, the convenience of news coverage inside the venue.</p>
<p>We are very grateful to the transportation and railway authorities for completely satisfying our first point. For example, every train on the Jinghu Railway stops at Taipingmen, so that the audience at the venue can see our newspapers earlier. The allocation of long-distance telephone lines on the Jinghu Line and the equipment of postal and telegraph services allow the news of the conference to be disseminated earlier. Everything is convenient for people. They understand that this is doing things for the country, so being able to do one point is fulfilling one point of strength for the country. These are admirable.</p>
<p>However, this second requirement has greatly disappointed us, and not only disappointed us, but also given us infinite sadness. At first, the unequal publication of conference news made the national press dissatisfied. Later, after finding out the details, the person in charge tried to remedy the situation, and it was finally resolved. Unexpectedly, two major events occurred at the opening of the conference:</p>
<h3>(1) Reporters Not Allowed to Enter the Venue</h3>
<p>May I ask, if news reporters are not allowed to enter the venue, then where will the news of the conference be obtained? Isn't this clearly refusing us to conduct interviews? (There are many irrelevant people sitting and standing on the conference podium, which I will not discuss here.) Fortunately, the situation was resolved immediately later, and then the second thing happened:</p>
<h3>(II) Reporters Only Allowed in One Venue</h3>
<p>May I ask, with eight or nine venues for the Games and numerous competitions taking place simultaneously, if newspapers are to obtain all the news, wouldn't it necessarily require eight or nine people? In this economically backward China, in this still undeveloped Chinese newspaper industry, does everyone have the ability to send eight or nine people? Isn't this clearly making things difficult for the press? Furthermore, the obstruction of the press by the Boy Scouts is also extremely disappointing. We feel that the Boy Scouts' enthusiasm for maintaining order at the Games venue should be greatly appreciated. However, it seems that the Boy Scouts this time are constantly antagonizing journalists. Whenever a reporter enters a venue, they are always sternly refused, even when there are orders from above. This spirit of defying orders is truly admirable. As a result, we have suffered considerable losses in terms of spirit and time, all thanks to the Boy Scouts.</p>
<p>Gentlemen, gentlemen in charge of the Games, what we seek is news of the Games, not your private property. What we seek is sports news, not secret diplomatic or military information. Moreover, the work we do is to serve the Games, which is to serve you, which is also to serve our Chinese nation. We hope you all understand this. This time, we are willing to increase the amount of space, increase the number of editions (such as morning editions, evening editions, extra editions, etc.), and spare no effort, all for the sake of satisfying the hopes of the Games athletes and spectators, to make everyone satisfied with the Games, and to make the Games achieve its mission. Otherwise, why would we sacrifice so much?</p>
<p>Gentlemen, let's not talk about how the World Games or the Far Eastern Games treat the press. Just look at how convenient the last North China Games were for the national press (it is said that the various conveniences for the press at this National Games were still fought for by those gentlemen who organized the North China Games). And look at how the last Shanghai Municipal Games tried to facilitate journalists from all over the country. These are all facts that everyone must still remember.</p>
<p>Alright, the Games have ended, and there is no need to say more. We just hope that the next National Games will be improved.</p>

<h3>Intense Competition</h3>
<p>The competition between the two teams was extremely intense. The excellent performance of the Guangdong-Hong Kong athletes was especially sensational. A brief description of the competition is as follows:</p>
<p>50-Yard Freestyle: Chen Qisong and Liu Baoxi represented the team. Chen was slightly slower at the start, and was unable to catch up, so Heitley took first place and White took second place. Chen and Liu were third and fourth, with very small differences in their times. The result was 25.2 seconds.</p>
<p>200-Yard Breaststroke: Guo Zhenheng and Wang Yaomin led the way throughout. At the end point, they were more than 20 yards ahead of the second place competitor. MacLeish was third and Hekens Ding was not selected. The time of 2 minutes 43.2 seconds set a new record.</p>
<p>400-Yard Freestyle: Chen Qisong was again powerful, leading the way. At the last turn, Chen Fuxing was overtaken by Logan. The result of 5 minutes 42.3 seconds set a new record.</p>
<p>Medley Relay: In the first 50-yard backstroke, Liu Baoxi was slower in the turn, falling behind Kerr. In the second 50-yard breaststroke, Guo Zhenheng bravely caught up and surpassed him. In the final 50-yard freestyle, Chen Qisong won by a hair's breadth over Heitley.</p>
<p>Water Polo Match: The Westerners' defense was very fierce. In the first half, they scored three times against the Chinese team, making it 2-0. In the second half, the Chinese team worked hard to counterattack. Guo Zhenheng scored one goal first, making it 3-1. Then the Westerners scored twice again, making it 5-1. Although Chen Fuxing and Chen Qisong scored three goals in a row, time had run out, and the Chinese team lost 4-5.</p>
<p>Women's Exhibition: There were only two events, and the absence of Yang Xiuqiong made it uninteresting.</p>
<p>Scoring Method: A 5-3-1 system was used, with the relay being 6-3 and water polo being 3-0. Diving was not scored.</p>
<h3>Tomorrow Night's Schedule</h3>

<h3>Minutes of the Second Meeting of the Ministry of Education's Physical Education Committee</h3>
<p>During the last National Education Conference, the Ministry of Education established a Physical Education Committee to promote physical education. Subsequently, the Ministry of Education formulated organizational rules and regulations and issued a circular to all provinces and cities to establish Physical Education Committees. The Ministry of Education's Physical Education Committee has already held one meeting. Taking advantage of the closing of the National Games and the convenience of physical education experts from all over the country being in Beijing, the second meeting was held at the Ministry of Education at 4:00 PM on the 20th. The committee members present were Xu Yusheng, Wang Zhengting, Chu Minyi, Wang Shijie, Zhou Yawei, Zhang Xinfu, Ma Zizhen, Yuan Dunli, Wu Yunrui, Huang Liming, Zhang Huilan, Shen Siliang, Hao Gengsheng, Zhang Boling, Zhang Jiong, Chen Panling, and those attending by invitation were Peng Baichuan, Zhang Zhijiang (represented by Jiang Rongqiao), Guo Lianfeng, etc., totaling 19 people. The meeting was chaired by Chu Minyi and recorded by Guo Yunfeng. The following is a record of the reports and resolutions:</p>
<h3>Reported Matters</h3>
<p>(1) The committee received 78 documents and issued 20 documents. (2) Since its establishment, the committee has held one general meeting and eight standing committee meetings (with mimeographed minutes attached). (3) Implementation of the resolutions of the first general meeting: 1. The draft of the physical education curriculum standards for primary and secondary schools has been reviewed and approved and promulgated and implemented by the Ministry of Education. 2. The organization of physical education curriculum discussion committees at all levels and schools has been carried out. The Ministry of Education has sent letters to invite Yuan Dunli, Hao Gengsheng, Wu Yunrui, Ling Chen Yingmei, Jiang Rongqiao, Zhang Jiwu, Chen Zhang'e, Xu Longhou, Fang Wanbang, Jin Zhaobai, Zhang Huilan, and 11 other people to be members. However, because the members are scattered all over the country and are busy with official duties, they have not yet been convened for a meeting. 3. The preparations for the National Games (detailed information on the preparations has been published in the National Games Daily Nos. 2 and 3). 4. Investigating various sports and games methods in rural villages in our country to improve them. The Ministry of Education has printed and distributed the investigation forms to the educational authorities of various provinces and cities for distribution and investigation. Currently, several provinces have submitted them. It is planned to gradually hand them over to Wu Yunrui for responsible sorting. 5. Urging the educational authorities of various provinces, cities, and counties to organize physical education committees has been repeatedly urged by the Ministry of Education. 6. The plan to establish a Central Physical Education College has been proposed by the Ministry to the Executive Yuan, and the 75th meeting of the Executive Yuan resolved to hand it over to the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Finance, and Minister He Yingqin for consultation and handling. However, Minister He has not been in Beijing for a long time, so it has been impossible to convene a meeting to discuss this plan, and it has not yet been actively carried out. 7. The plan to stipulate the standards and detailed curriculum for the training of physical education talents. This plan has been handed over to the Physical Education Curriculum Standards Committee for discussion. Since the committee has not yet been convened, it has not been carried out. 8. The experiment of physical education curriculum standards. The original plan was to ask Yuan Dunli, Wu Yunrui, Hao Gengzheng, Zhang Tilan, Zhang Jiwu, Huang Liming, and other gentlemen to conduct experiments in Pingjin, Qingjing, and other places. However, the committee has not yet received a report. It is planned to ask the above members to report on the experimental process separately. 9. The organization of a physical education assessment methods and standards research committee has already appointed Wu Yunrui, Yuan Dunli, Xu Longhou, Zhang Lan, Huang Liming, and other gentlemen as members. 10. The regulations on women's physical education programs have been handled by the Physical Education Assessment Methods and Standards Research Committee. Currently, the committee has no report. 11. The plan to prepare for summer physical education cram school (see the Summer Physical Education Cram School Daily and the Student List for details). 12. The regulations on the qualifications of physical education supervisors in various provinces and cities have been promulgated and implemented by the Ministry of Education. (4) The matters that should be implemented in the second year of the National Physical Education Implementation Plan, which were not discussed at the first general meeting and have been promulgated and implemented by the Ministry of Education: 1. The physical education expenses of schools at all levels in cities must be implemented according to the set standards. 2. Physical education fields should be established in major cities. 3. Regulations stipulating that physical education is a required subject for schools at all levels, and those who fail cannot be promoted or graduate. The provinces will retain the number of places for studying physical education abroad.</p>
<h3>Proposals</h3>
<p>(1) The Ministry of Education should urgently establish a physical education supervisor's office in accordance with the resolution of last year's National Physical Education Conference. Reasons: (1) The physical education curriculum standards for schools at all levels have long been announced nationwide, and it is urgent to observe whether schools at all levels are following them. (2) Private physical education schools are rampant everywhere. It is urgent to inspect and correct whether the school's various facilities, teacher qualifications, student levels, and curriculum content are qualified. (2) The Ministry of Education should subsidize the National Physical Education Association's expenses (Wu Yunrui, reasons: The National Physical Education Association has organized the Far Eastern and World competitions against foreign countries, which is a national cause that is closely related to promoting the national spirit and restoring the reputation of the "sick man of East Asia". The Ministry of Education is the highest authority in charge of national physical education, and the National Physical Education Association is the highest authority that assists the Ministry of Education in handling national physical education. The former of course has the obligation to subsidize the latter's expenses.</p>
<h3>Discussion Matters</h3>
<p>(1) Establishing a physical education supervisor's office (resolution): Please ask the Ministry of Education to set up a physical education supervisor as soon as possible. (2) Establishing a Central Physical Education College (resolution): Please ask Minister Wang to submit the original proposal to the Executive Yuan meeting again. (3) Determining the name of this year's Games (resolution): This year's Games will be named the Fifth National Games. (4) The date and location of the Sixth National Games (resolution): In the future, the National Games will be held every two years in Nanjing. However, the Sixth National Games will be held in Shanghai on Double Ten Festival in the 24th year due to the preparation of the Far Eastern Games venue. (5) Participating in next year's Far Eastern Games (resolution): This committee will cooperate with the China Sports Association, and please ask the association to formulate a plan and budget, and the Ministry of Education will submit it to the Executive Yuan for subsidies. (6) Requesting subsidies for the China National Sports Association (resolution): The China Sports Association should formulate the amount of subsidies to be granted and send it to the Ministry of Education for submission to the government for subsidies. (7) The General Training Department's plan to establish a National Military Physical Education School and the Ministry of Education's plan to establish a National Physical Education College will cooperate (resolution): approved. (8) Plan to continue holding summer physical education cram school next year (resolution): approved. Please ask the Ministry of Education to prepare for it.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Charge</h3>
<p>— Traveler</p>
<p>"Pushing" and "kicking" can only injure or kill one or two people. If you want to do more damage, you have to "charge."</p>
<p>The news on the 13th carried a dispatch from Guiyang stating that on the 918 Anniversary, students from various schools gathered for a parade. The Director of Education, Tan Xingge, panicked and sent troops to occupy the street corners and used multiple cars to charge into the procession, resulting in a tragedy. Two students died, and more than 42 were injured, with the most casualties being students from Zhengyi Primary School, who were only around ten years old...</p>
<p>I only knew before that military generals were generally literate and could write parallel prose telegrams when "waiting in arms for dawn." Now I understand that even civil officials are proficient in strategy. Tian Dan once used fire oxen, and now cars are used instead, which is indeed the 20th century.</p>
<p>"Charging" is the most efficient tactic. A team of cars, charging wildly, causes the enemy to be killed or injured under the wheels, how simple and direct; "charging" is also the most awe-inspiring behavior, with a flick of the switch, speeding like lightning, making the opponent unable to avoid it, how heroic. Soldiers and police in various countries like to use water cannons to charge, and the Russian Tsar once used Cossack cavalry to charge, all of which are quick actions. In the concessions, we sometimes see foreign soldiers' tanks patrolling, which is a sign that if you are not compliant, they will come to charge.</p>
<p>Although cars are not effective weapons for charging, fortunately, the enemy is just elementary school students. A tired donkey is absolutely useless on the battlefield, but it can still be competent and enjoyable to gallop on soft grass with a knight sitting on it, even though some people may find it ridiculous.</p>
<p>It is indeed a bit ridiculous that children around the age of ten would revolt. But our China is a place that often produces prodigies. They can paint at the age of one, write poetry at the age of two, perform in operas at the age of seven, and join the army at the age of ten. It is a common fact; even girls of seven or eight years old are violated, which, from others' perspective, is equivalent to "the age of blooming flowers."</p>
<p>Moreover, when "charging," if the opposite side is someone who can offer some resistance, then the charging will not be so smooth, and the charger will not be so heroic. Therefore, the enemy must be chosen to be weak and tender. Thugs bullying villagers, foreigners beating Chinese people, and education directors charging elementary school students are all heroes who are good at defeating the enemy.</p>
<p>"Bearing the brunt," previously seemed to be just an empty phrase, but now it is being fulfilled. This fulfillment is not only for adults, but also for children. "Infant slaughter" is considered a crime and is a thing of the past. The days when tossing infants into the air and catching them with spear tips is seen only as a trick are probably not far away.</p>
<h3>On "Incorrect Characters"</h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>Mr. Feng Zhiyu, from Mr. Shi Zhicun's introduction to Zhuangzi and Wenxuan, spoke of Mr. Liu Bannong's mockery of young people writing incorrect characters, saying that "the vernacular movement has been victorious, and some warriors have even climbed up because of it; but because they have climbed up, they not only no longer fight for the vernacular but also trample it underfoot and use ancient characters to mock the younger generation." This situation is lamentable. The vernacular has suffered four major tribulations: the mockery of Lin Qinnan, the attacks of the Xuechong School, and the rejection of Cao Mu, all with great momentum and a desire to destroy it. Eventually, due to the large number of people defending the vernacular in both the North and South, the enemy retreated. In the years of the Republic of China 13 and 14, Zhang Shizhao challenged the vernacular in Hou Jiayin with immense force, and those who stepped forward to fight were relentless, but Mr. Zhang also retreated exhausted. Unexpectedly, times have changed. The surrender city that Hu Shi built for Zhang Shizhao does not see the deposed emperor of the classical language bound and surrendering; instead, the main generals of the vernacular are bowing down and surrendering to the classical language palace, which is a strange thing indeed.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I read the 65th issue of Independent Criticism and saw Mr. Zhu Ziqing's High School Graduate Chinese Curriculum, which expresses concern about young people writing incorrect characters and so on. He also says that in the past, "middle school students were good at Chinese because of family influence rather than school influence." It is strange that today's vernacular masters are all speaking with one voice, "evoking the melancholy of thinking about the past." The poison gas shells that the enemies used to fire in the past, saying that "those who don't read ancient books can't write vernacular" and "those who write vernacular well are those who write classical Chinese well," were not effective at that time; now, these surrendered generals in our camp have copied them all onto the white flags they are holding; if Lin Qinnan knew this in the afterlife, he would surely laugh out loud!</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "Don't boost others' morale and diminish your own prestige." Is writing incorrect characters a major flaw in writing? Is it necessary to borrow light from Zhuangzi and Wenxuan? "The Republic of China is an ancient country," and because of this, those who are born today still have the obligation to read ancient characters and books from three thousand years ago, and the obligation to learn the ancient methods of "using characters" in the "age of using words." (In other countries, Egyptian, Babylonian, Greek, and Latin writing have long been categorized under specialized scholars.) The ancient debt is too heavy, and not only can today's youth not repay it, but even the idle and learned scholars of ancient times could not repay it, so "writing incorrect characters" and "reading incorrect characters" are rights that we should enjoy. The so-called Six Scripts of the Han people, among which "mutual explanation" and "borrowing" are different interpretations of writing and reading incorrect characters. ""Strong" is a cicada, from the insect radical, with the sound of hong." It is borrowed to be used as the "strong" in "strength." (The "strong" in "strength" should use the character "彊".) "党 is the same as 黨." It is borrowed to be used as the "party" in "faction." (The "party" in "political party" should use the character "攩".) In the past, people wrote incorrect characters and beautified it by calling it "borrowing"; could the ancients borrow but we cannot? The ancients often borrowed in their use of words. The phrase "lingering" can be written as "留聯" (Qin Fu). The phrase "continuous" can be written as "駱驛" (Biography of Guo Ji in the Later Han Dynasty). The phrase "discrepancy" can be written as "柴池" (Sima Xiangru's Fu). The phrase "hesitating" can be written as "侵尋" (Historical Records). The phrase "generous" can be written as "凱康" (Goddess Fu). Therefore, writing "Changming" as "Changming" was not a big deal for the ancients, and there was no need for Dr. Liu to be so alarmed. Mr. Zhu Ziqing saw "back" written as "雁夹背" and was filled with emotion; if he saw that the Book of Han wrote "sharply" as "及盪," and Liu Zongyuan wrote "abrupt" as "盪突," what would he think? It is said that "in the Zhejiang Qianlong Bingzi provincial examination, the two chief examiners, one surnamed Zhuang and the other surnamed Ju. Duke Zhuang was muddleheaded, and Duke Ju was not cautious; someone collected Du Fu's lines to mock them, saying: "When will Zhuang's dream wake up, Ju flowers need not bloom from now on." This was extremely apt. After Ju finished the examination, he went back and said to Chen Jushan, the Vice Minister of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices: "The people of Hangzhou are really lacking in understanding, how can 'Ju' be connected to 'Chrysanthemum'?" The Duke did not answer. Ju pressed him, and the Duke said: "I was just thinking about the lunar calendar: chrysanthemums have yellow flowers." Ju was very ashamed." Now, Mr. Feng Zhiyu has remembered the line from the Book of Songs, "The young man leads, I harmonize with the girl," what will Dr. Liu think?</p>
<p>I believe that Chinese characters are difficult to remember, and a slight reform should be sought from the bottom up. The only way to treat the symptoms at present is to follow the trend of reading and writing incorrect characters and cultivate the habit of reading and writing them more often; (this can also be said to be an ancient method.) Because only when there are extremely common "simplified characters" in society can they be recognized by intellectuals who claim to read ancient books; and new phonetic-semantic characters that are half phonetic and half semantic are likely to be produced. The past is gone, and I hope that the youth of the future will not have to repay such a heavy debt! Therefore, I strongly protest against Mr. Shi's introduction to Zhuangzi and Wenxuan, and Dr. Liu and Mr. Zhu Ziqing's mockery of young people writing incorrect characters.</p>
<h3>From Children's Books to "Primary School Students' Library"</h3>
<p>— Xin Yi</p>
<p>The children's books that our country has today, whether in terms of quality or quantity, are not satisfactory in any aspect. Of course, this unfavorable situation is difficult to blame on any one aspect of society: because any undertaking in society is subject to many external influences. In today's China, it is a fantasy to expect one or two undertakings to have extraordinary progress.</p>
<p>From my personal point of view, the biggest shortcoming of children's books in our country is that children have no idea where to start reading, and primary schools have no idea where to start buying. If you say there are no children's books, there are quite a few stories of gods and monsters or novels of swordsmen; there are also many poems of haha laughter or laughter haha; precisely because of this, children either don't read, or if they do, they read this kind; primary schools either don't buy, or if they do, they buy this kind. As a result, children don't get much benefit from reading more; and primary schools, in order to save money, simply don't buy any children's books at all.</p>
<p>Recently, I saw the advertisement for the Commercial Press's "Primary School Students' Library" in the newspaper, and I couldn't help but be moved by curiosity and asked for a copy of the catalog. After carefully reading it, the first series consists of 500 books, divided into 45 categories, and basically includes all the books that children must read. Also, the number of words, pages, illustrations, and authors of all the books in the first series are clearly indicated to show credibility. I think that its compilation can take into account all aspects of the knowledge and skills that children in our country must have, which is its greatest feature and is indeed very commendable. I believe that a good change will occur in the field of children's books in our country as a result || At least, we can successively publish several new systematic series of children's books; or rigorously reorganize the already published children's books.</p>
<p>Of course, we should be strict when commenting on something; but, in the barren publishing world of our country, in order to advocate, we should give more encouragement to work that is relatively valuable, such as publishing the "Primary School Students' Library."</p>
<p>Also, in the catalog of the first series of the "Primary School Students' Library," a very small portion of the books have already been published. According to the editor's statement, these books have all been thoroughly revised. I think that if old books are valuable or have been reorganized, readers will never despise them just because they have been published before.</p>
<h3>Tragedy in the Midnight</h3>
<p>— Hei Ying</p>
<p>This long road was completely silent, as if it had died. A rickshaw came speeding from the corner.</p>
<p>Clatter, clatter, clatter…</p>
<p>Almost the sound of horses' hooves, clear and resonant.</p>
<p>The rickshaw puller was panting and sweating.</p>
<p>It was already late autumn. Comfortable people had long covered themselves with cotton quilts, seeking their good dreams, who would care about the rickshaw puller on the road?</p>
<p>It was simply half a horse's drudgery!</p>
<p>The foreign sailor in the rickshaw:</p>
<p>"Lili la, la la..."</p>
<p>The power of the alcohol was burning in his chest, the wind was not cold, and he was very happy singing without beginning or end.</p>
<p>"La la la, Li..."</p>
<p>Clatter, clatter, clatter…</p>
<p>The rickshaw puller's feet were keeping time.</p>
<p>Pulling straight down, it became increasingly desolate! The streetlights emitted a pale light, and some empty rickshaws were slowly walking along the roadside. Suddenly, an Austin car with wide eyes sped over from the front, without even sounding the horn, and disappeared with a whoosh.</p>
<p>"Hey!"</p>
<p>The foreign sailor's boot kicked the rickshaw puller's butt.</p>
<p>Subconsciously, the rickshaw puller quickened his pace.</p>
<p>Clatter, clatter, clatter…</p>
<p>The beat was faster, and the singing was even more energetic; the sound on the quiet road was like a horse neighing in the deep mountains.</p>
<p>…Arriving in front of a monstrous barracks, the rickshaw was put down, and the rickshaw puller took a deep breath, wiping the sweat with his sleeves.</p>
<p>"Lili la…"</p>
<p>The sailor jumped down, straightened his chest, and walked away.</p>
<p>"Sir… Money…"</p>
<p>The rickshaw puller followed him, extending his calloused hand. But the foreign sailor didn't even look back and disappeared into the gate!</p>
<p>"You ancestor… you mother's…"</p>
<p>Cursing, the rickshaw puller had no choice but to pick up the rickshaw and walk away.</p>
<p>There was no sound, the long road was like it had died. Pulling it, pulling something that felt like a thousand pounds, his steps involuntarily slowed down step by step.</p>
<h3>Two Brothers (5)</h3>
<p>— Guy de Maupassant, Translated by Li Weike</p>
<p>Now he was looking at the fish he had caught with the joy of a miser: then he looked up at the sky, saw that the sun was already setting, and said:</p>
<p>"Alright! Children, shall we prepare to go back?"</p>
<p>The two brothers then put away their fishing lines, wiped the hooks dry, and hung them on the corks to wait.</p>
<p>Old Man Roland stood up and looked at the sky like a captain, saying:</p>
<p>"There's no wind, let's row back, children!"</p>
<p>He then suddenly stretched out his arms and pointed north, saying:</p>
<p>"Look, look, the Southampton ship."</p>
<p>On the flat sea, tense like a piece of blue silk, vast, brilliant, reflecting the sunlight like fire and gold, there was a wisp of light black smoke rising into the rose-like sky where Old Man Roland was pointing. And under this cloud of smoke, we could see the ship, which looked very small from far, far away.</p>
<p>Looking south, we could also see many other clouds of smoke coming from the vicinity of the Havre embankment, which only showed a white line and a straight lighthouse like the tip of a horn.</p>
<p>Old Man Roland asked:</p>
<p>"Today should be the day the 'Normandie' enters the port, right?"</p>
<p>Jean replied:</p>
<p>"Yes, Papa."</p>
<p>"Pass me the binoculars, I bet that ship over there is it."</p>
<p>Old Man Roland lengthened the copper tube of the binoculars, aimed it at his eyes, searching for the point of view, and suddenly, he was happy that he saw it:</p>
<p>"That's right, that's right, it's it, I recognize its two funnels. Mrs. Lu, would you like to take a look?"</p>
<p>She took the binoculars, looked at the transatlantic mail ship in the distance, and undoubtedly, she was unable to aim it at the ship, because she couldn't see anything, only a blue color, plus a colored circle, a round rainbow, and then some strange phenomena that made her nauseous, some shadows.</p>
<p>She returned the binoculars to Old Man Roland and said:</p>
<p>"I never knew how to use this thing. This used to make my husband angry, he would often stand in front of the window for hours watching the ships pass by."</p>
<p>Old Man Roland felt very disappointed and said:</p>
<p>"There must be something wrong with your eyes, because my binoculars are excellent!"</p>
<p>Then he handed the binoculars to his woman and said:</p>
<p>"Would you like to take a look?"</p>
<p>"No, thank you. I know without looking that I won't be able to see anything."</p>

<h3>Financial: Silver Price Rises, Exchange Rate Falls; Gold Price Rebounds by Five Yuan and Three Jiao | Foreign News Unfavorable, Market Struggles</h3>
<p>The gold market was quite calm yesterday, and morale was slightly weary. Thus, the market remained uncertain for half the day. Initially, overseas silver markets in the UK and US rose, with the forward silver price on the Five Metals Exchange rising by 4.5% and 6.3% respectively. However, the exchange rate declined, which boosted morale. The price of raw gold in London fell by 10 and a half pence, while the price of new mining gold in the US was $29.13, 5 cents lower than before. US cotton rose by 8 points, stocks rose by $2.25, and US wheat rose by 3.875 points, but these had little impact. The raw sugar market opened at $23-24, with ample supply, but gradually declined. Reuters reported that US President Roosevelt had issued a statement favorable to agricultural products, leading to a break below $20 and further decline. After the opening, due to low morale, the market trended weak and listless, making it difficult to hold firm. However, with banks actively absorbing, and the exchange market tightening, speculators actively covered their positions, gradually rising above $20 and fluctuating around that level. Reuters reported from Washington that the US Farm Management Committee was urgently planning to remedy the agricultural product situation, including providing cash loans to wheat farmers who are willing to reduce farmland, and that representatives of agricultural associations will meet in Washington on October 25 to discuss inflation and other matters. There was still a further decline, with a final struggle at the $20 mark. The spot price was $1,120. The market situation for the first half of the day is recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was $817, a rise of $3 from the previous close. Goods opened at $7.20. The exchange market opened with the near-term selling price for British pounds at 1 shilling, 3 pence, and 375 points, and the US dollar at $29. Tongtai, Changyuan, Shengyong, and Fuyu advanced to $8.50, while Zhaofeng, Changzhi, Fengyong, and Zhengchang sold at $6.50, creating a volatile situation. Yuansheng, Yongyuan, Xingyong, Fuyu, Yida, and Yonghengtai advanced again to $8.20, but morale remained unstable, making it difficult to rally. Hengyu, Yifeng, Yongyuan, Maoyong, Zhaofengchang, Yuanxingyong, Yida, and others jointly supplied positions. It was predicted that HSBC would quote the pound at 1.875 points higher, causing it to fall back to $4.80. Later, it was learned that the US dollar only rose by 25 points, and the Dalian gang and Hengyu Yuanfengyong took advantage of the low price to purchase positions, stabilizing the situation again. Fageley was bullish on February US dollars at 75 points, and McGarrett was bullish on January francs at 536 points. Hengyu, Tongtaichang, Zhaofengchang, Qingfa, Yongfuyu, Fuchang, Daxingyong, and others strongly purchased, and McGarrett, Mitsui, and Wahbi absorbed February US dollars at 6875 points, causing it to rise to $20.05. Zhaofengchang and Yifengyongbing sold, retreating to $18.50, and then started another round. Hengyu, Tongtaichang, and Hongli advanced to $21, while Ruikang and Fuyu sold at $19.10, but because McGarrett was still bullish on January by half a yuan, Yuanmaoyong and Zhaofengchang advanced to $21.90. Foreign news reported that American farmers were demanding inflation, and the Dalian gang, Richang, Zhaofengchang, Yuanchun, Dingchang, and Sida competed to sell, causing it to fall to $17. Zhifengyongyuan and Heng purchased positions, maintaining stability. The banks then absorbed January at half a yuan. Then, with Wanxing and Dafayong's strong purchases, it finally rose to $22. Goods were supplied at high prices by Tongtaichang, Shunli, and others, gradually retreating to $18.20. The market situation remained volatile, fluctuating for a while. The afternoon close was $819.30. After the close, Wanxing and others advanced positions, rising slightly, and finally retreated to within $9. Goods were traded at $8.50. It was found that the highest price during the first half of the day was $822, and the lowest was $814.80, with a difference of $7.20. As a result, it closed $5.30 higher than the previous close.</p>
<p>The revealed price was $28.625 because HSBC quoted the US dollar at 25 points higher, equating to a gold price of $838+. Based on the closing price, it was said to be approximately $19, $12+ less than the previous close. The current month's and account price was $835, November's was $827, and December's was $819. The morning top-up water price was $835. The spot price was $1,120. There was very little trading in the market, and the situation was quiet. Local goods were $1,120, sold to the Hong Kong gang by peers, with only 200+ transactions. Swap transactions lacked formal deals, and colleagues paid little attention. 183 tickets were left for this month, and 2,100 tickets for November.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was uncertain. In summary, Wanxing, Shunli, Tongchun, Tongyi, Zhifengyong, Hengchun, Dakang, Hengchang, Yongyuanxing, Yonghengyu, Senchangyong, Zhaofengchang, Tongtaichang, etc. all advanced. Bingxing, Dachang, Xiangyuanmao, Ruikangyong, Deyuanchun, Fuyu, Yifengyongfuyutai, Hengsida, etc. were on the selling side. Yuanhengzhifengyongda and Fada Yong, etc. first sold and then advanced. Yuanshengyongfuyu, Yida and Yong, etc. first advanced and then sold. The Dalian gang and Wanxing jointly made 2,500+ tickets, netting 500+ tickets. Shunfu jointly made 2,200+ tickets, netting 200+ tickets. The Guang gang, Hengxing, did not trade much.</p>
<p>The long-short positions of colleagues, as of the 20th, were: the long positions included the Dalian gang and Wanxingshunli, each with 2,1200 tickets, Hongxing with 1,700+, Tongfengheng with 1,600+, Yiyurunchangyu with 1,400+ each, Fuchang with slightly less than 1,400, Yongfeng with 800+, and Dafengheng with 600+ tickets.

<h3>Financial Market Quiet on Saturday</h3>
<p>Yesterday was Saturday again, and banks were closed in the afternoon as usual. Although various settlements are currently in a busy period, due to time constraints, they became quiet. Many unfinished procedures were merged into next Monday for processing. The market situation remained unchanged. Both morning and afternoon market rates were 6%, with overnight rates being oversupplied for a long time. The situation was extremely loose, so there were no transactions.

<h3>Auxiliary Coins: Little Fluctuation</h3>

The volume of transactions was 7,000 jiao in the morning and 3,000 jiao in the afternoon.

<h3>Securities and Public Bonds: Large Households Suddenly Have Huge Sales Before the Close | Two Million of the 20th Customs, Consolidated Tax, and Salt Tax Are Sold</h3>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Securities Exchange, the market was still extremely chaotic in the morning, with slight changes in the afternoon. The reason why large households such as No. 21 were selling so vigorously is still unclear. However, at the same time, Nos. 4, 31, and 38 were trending to cover positions, also extremely actively, and the market suddenly became lively. But the result did not have much change. At the morning opening, only the Disbandment Bond rose by 1.5 jiao, while the lower ones slightly weakened by 0.5-1 jiao, and the market was still very chaotic. The second round continued to weaken by 1-2 jiao, while the Consolidated Tax and Salt Tax slightly recovered. Thus, the two rounds in the morning were still in a state of fluctuation, but many long positions by retail investors had already been sold off. At the afternoon opening, short positions slightly covered, and there were more swap transactions, with the market price rising more and falling less, about 1-2 jiao. Before the close, the various listed bonds were still very stable. This is the usual phenomenon on Saturdays. When it came to the 20th Customs, No. 21 suddenly had huge sales. About two million of the 20th Customs, Consolidated Tax, and Salt Tax were sold. But at the same time, Nos. 4, 31, and 38 took the opportunity to absorb a lot. There were only two or three selling households on the floor, while there were many buying households, and eyes were gathered on No. 21. Thus, the Consolidated Tax was only down by 0.5 jiao this month, and the rest were only down by 0.2-0.3 jiao. This huge sale suddenly occurred at the Saturday close, and the number of monthly sellers was extremely small, a rare occurrence, so the reason for it has not yet been ascertained. The market price for the entire day resulted in a slight decrease of 0.5-3.5 jiao. The total transaction volume was $8,557,000, including $2,000 in spot goods, $4,125,000 in Consolidated Tax and Salt Tax, $775,000 in First Customs Bonds, $2,465,000 in the 20th Customs Bonds, and $696,000, and the rest ranged from tens of thousands to $840,000.</p>
<h3>New York Stock Market Slightly Rebounds | Rumor that the Government Will Recognize Soviet Russia</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported that the New York stock market rebounded on the 20th, due to the market having many short positions and the rumor that the US government will recognize Soviet Russia. However, the future of the market does not seem to be trending stable. The total transaction volume was 2,680,000 shares. "Wheat" initially fell due to weakness in Liverpool, and then rebounded due to the US government purchasing spot goods and December and May futures. Wheat prices are still low and still favorable to buyers. "Cotton" farmers are gradually showing dissatisfaction, which is increasing pressure on the government, wanting the government to raise cotton prices with new methods. It is said that the Farmers' Cooperative is requesting the government to lend farmers 1.5 jiao per pound of cotton for the cotton fields where farmers actually reduce planting next year. The position of cotton is still good, but the lack of short selling interest has not had much impact on the market. Factories purchased 415,000 bales this week. The news that the US government is starting negotiations to recognize Soviet Russia may cause the market to rise. The silver market situation is very stable because there are rumors of further inflation. The US Treasury's gold price is $29.12 per ounce. The Dow Jones indices are listed below.</p>

<p>30 Industrial Stocks 86.62 Up 2.25</p>

<h3>Yarn Market: Cotton Yarn's Momentum Weak</h3>
<p>The yarn market is stable, with fluctuations within 5 jiao, but the situation is very bleak. However, the certain association is still continuing to purchase this month's price up to $84. The forward market is weaker, and there are more than 6,000 bales of new goods entering the warehouse. Future changes are difficult to predict.</p>
<h3>Human Standards Are Mediocre</h3>
<p>The human label market opened in the morning with a mediocre situation, and there were not many buyers. After the certain association imposed restrictions, general speculators had no interest, so transactions greatly reduced, and the market completely entered a standstill.

<h3>Cotton Label: Buyers Remain Firm</h3>
<p>The cotton market is still firm in the near month. The amount of both sides transactions is still 156,800 loads. The Cotton Inspection Department checked roughly 20,000 loads of inspected cotton. The buyers' intention is still firm and very strong, but the shorts covering their position do not have any active movements. Long and short sides are competing intensely. Business is still cold and selling prices are slightly relaxed.</p>
<h3>Zheng Standard Steady</h3>
<p>Zheng Standard opened on the previous market, the near month was slightly weak, but the far month was firmer, but trading was mediocre, with the near month falling by 5 points and the far month rising by 1 jiao.

<h3>Factory Currency is Mediocre</h3>
<p>The need for current cotton is mediocre, and the sources are Yao flower 1,683 bales and Tong flower 1,590 bales. The current flower prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Fire Machine Flower 38.25 Dong Cotton Bank Enters 400 Bales Arriving at Dakang</p>
<p>US Cotton 45.00 Hengjue Factory Enters 200 Pieces Spot Delivery to Factory</p>
<h3>US Cotton One Jiao Loan May Be Established</h3>
<p>New York, October 20th, reports on the cotton market situation this week: the government's monetary policy has started to be determined based on the current situation. Whether there will be an active change is becoming increasingly doubtful. In addition, the European situation is unstable. Thus, at the beginning of this week, various parties settled, causing the raw cotton market to be in a more stable position in terms of actual buying and selling. Then, with the report that the government's one-jiao-per-pound loan will soon be implemented, and the atmosphere of the current cotton market gradually tightening, and the government's purchase of 100,000 bales, the market price then rebounded. According to Southern news, although high base prices were suspended, they ultimately did not lead to much cotton in the mainland. The climate is favorable to cotton production. People in the industry have said that this year's cotton harvest may not be slightly less than last year's. At the same time, there are also those who expect the government's field reduction program to have a backlash and are holding that concept. However, buyers are careful and want to wait for the development of spot domestic cloth head markets in the South and the general situation at home and abroad.</p>
<h3>US Cotton's Rising Power is Still Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market initially fell due to bad news from Liverpool, then rose due to political news favorable to the longs, and finally fell due to some longs settling. As a result, spot goods rose by 5 points, and futures rose by 5-8 points. Liverpool cotton spot goods rose by 3 points, and futures rose and fell by 1-2 points. Egyptian cotton spot goods rose by 3 points. The Bombay cotton market rose due to short covering and speculative buying. As a result, Pingal and Omra both rose by 1.5 rupees, and Bairoxi rose by 1 rupee. The original telegram is recorded on the left (October 20th telegram).</p>

<h3>Grains: General Rice Prices Are All Stable</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) There are more than 50 sources, and the enthusiasm of customers in buying is still active. The quantity of broken rice is also considerable. A total of more than 1,100 packages have been absorbed by the Beiyang gang. However, the market situation has turned stable due to the too strong market surge yesterday. The final price has not changed much. The new Du Yang Jianling has also been active. But it is still stable. The supply of white, red, and wild rice is greater than the demand, and the market price is drooping. Each broken japonica in packages has a slight selection. Store customers are still sluggish, and the market situation is difficult to stand firm. The market continues to be outside the standard and the new Yuan has not been much changed.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) The number of arrivals from various sources is 46-47. Sales on the market are bleak. The market form is that broken japonica has arrived and the tip of the white yuan is slightly less than the price of angle. The new Du Tip is less than the price of angle. The type of broken rice is less than the price of angle. Species of broken rice add several points. The guest tip rice has also followed to the downstream.</p>
<h3>Guest Rice Quanzhou Digestion Continues to be Active</h3>
<p>Yesterday the Guest Rice market situation formed a soft leveling, because there was a continuous train load of arrivals in the market, and there was also a continuous arrival of wheeled goods. The inventory is gradually filling up. The road to Fuzhou continues to be suspended. The Guangdong gang has been staring at Xiangwan for sales. The Zhejiang stomach and this street are both sluggish, so the opening price in the morning was small. Subsequently, the Quanzhou gang took the opportunity to buy, and sales seemed to continue smoothly, so the market was tired and stood again, but the middle and second grade have already brought small fractions of points. A total of 700 packages of Xiangnan brown rice were opened, at a price of $5.96 to $5.9. 1,500 packages of Nanjing machine rice, at a price of $6.88 to $6.6. Also, 430 packages of glutinous rice, at a price of $5.9 to $5.75, were all handled by a Quanzhou gang.</p>
<h3>Flour Presents a Patchy, Uncertain State</h3>
<p>After the flour market opened yesterday morning, the various months were generally stable. The price of foreign wheat continued to see Ang. Chicago near rose by 6.0 degrees, the long term by 1.23 yuan. Canada's average increased by six or seven degrees, so after opening, the market atmosphere of various months seemed to present a clever trend. However, inside and outside the industry, buyers have no hope of development because the actual sales are bleak, so transactions are very small, and the increase is only about 1 point. Until the afternoon opening, the attitude of the actual sales gang was still quiet, and in addition to the near and long term months, factories had slight hedging sales, and it was rumored that the US wheat borrowed by the government had four or five foreign firms touting business, probably handled by foreign firms and transferred to factories. Messages like this, of course, made the market return to level and fall. As a result, October and November were smaller by 5% compared to the previous day, December was greater by 5%, January was smaller by 7.5%, February did not move, and March was greater by 5%.</p>
<h3>The Future of Wheat is Flat and the Future is Smart</h3>
<p>After the wheat market opened yesterday morning and afternoon, the months generally presented a level and stable appearance. The price of foreign wheat, Chicago, rose by 67 cents to 1.23 yuan, and Canada rose by about 67 cents, so the market seemed to be stable after opening, but this month is close to delivery and most of the foreign long positions have to be closed. In addition to the factories, the rest of the buyers, of course, do not want to receive them, so the recent market is not stable, but February and March, due to the purchase by foreign retail hoarders, the market is quite invigorated, but speaking from the actual situation, the surplus abroad is very obvious, and fewer steps should be taken to excessively recover. As a result, this month was smaller by 1 point, November was larger by 1 point, December was larger by 1 point, and February and March each received 5 points. Current wheat transactions are still stagnant, and only 2,000 packages of Yangzhou wheat were opened throughout the day, at a price of $3.63, handled by Fufeng.</p>
<h3>Mung Beans Still Being Procured by the Yong Gang</h3>
<p>There are not many sources of mung beans, and the stock is not thick. The currency houses are tightening and selling due to the relationship between the stock. The road to sales is the widest in the South Yang gang, followed by this street and Ningliu inland, etc. Therefore, although sales are not large, there is a continuous movement, and the situation is quite stable. Yesterday, the Ningbo gang went to Bengbu to buy 46 packages of bright mung beans, at a price of $4.40.</p>
<h3>The Sugar Market: Cottony White Sugar in This Factory Drops Another Five Points</h3>
<p>Yesterday, because the sugar market was on Saturday, there was no shipment today, transactions were scarce, and the trend was tired. The public club allocated 24 groups of sand white ordinary goods called $21.50, and there were no transactions in the original market. Dutch red NT mark $16.60, there were slight transactions, slightly higher than $16.75. Taikoo Sugar B mark called $21.50, but did not succeed. The cottony white sugar in this factory, Zhonghua Guohua Zhenji, was reduced by another 5 points, No. 1 was $20.20, Zhonghua top number $20.40, and the rest of the No. 2, 3, 4, and 5 gears were reduced according to the standard. The Chiao Ching number market was still traded a lot, with a total of 500+ packages opened, and the Chongti Zhuang price was $15.7, followed by $15.30 to $0.05, and again $14.85 to $7.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Hongjiang Tung Oil Sales Stagnant</h3>
<p>After the Mid-Autumn Festival, the sales season for Hongjiang tung oil had already passed, and the market gradually became stagnant. During the peak summer sales period, the local merchants had very little stock, and new supplies were interrupted, leading to a severe shortage and widespread anxiety, with some fearing they would not be able to obtain any. The market was very strong, with Zheng Hong Jichanghe rising to over twenty-nine yuan per barrel, and Fu Hong Yang Hengyuan Qingyuanfeng also selling for over twenty-five yuan. This broke the sluggish trend of recent years and was a welcome development. However, in a short time, with the arrival of autumn winds and dew and the gradual retreat of the summer heat, the Hong oil sales season faded away like an old fan. The stock of each merchant was not only sufficient to meet demand but also had some surplus. High prices when there is excess stock is a normal market condition. Now that the Mid-Autumn Festival is over, sales have declined, and the market is gradually moving downwards. Jichanghe is only at twenty-eight yuan, and although Yang Qing’s two brands are priced at twenty-three yuan, it is feared that they will hardly be able to maintain that level. Overall, because the season has passed, even lower prices cannot stimulate sales. It is likely that this situation will continue until new production from the producing areas is reported in winter, at which point there may be hope for development.</p>
<h3>Metals: British Steel Plate Soars</h3>
<p>Recently, British steel plates have seen very active trading due to the enthusiastic purchases by various groups in Tianjin and Hankou. The price level has been rising, and because the supply source is not continuous, the psychology of the industry is very firm, resulting in extraordinarily strong prices. Currently, the market price for 2.5-fen thickness is ten yuan and five jiao per dan, 5-fen is eight yuan and seven jiao, 7.5-fen is eight yuan and five jiao, and 1-fen is eight yuan, all of which are one or two jiao higher than before. However, recent overseas prices are also very good, so the early market trend still has the potential to soar.</p>
<h3>Lead Prices Resume Uptrend</h3>
<p>Since overseas prices for lead began to rise, the local market has shown signs of improvement. However, due to the continuous arrival of Hunan native lead, it has been difficult to raise the price of foreign lead in the Shanghai market. In recent days, the uptrend in the market has reappeared. The reason is that Hunan native lead is being purchased by the Hanyang Arsenal and is unlikely to be shipped to Shanghai. Therefore, foreign lead in the Shanghai market has seized the opportunity to rise. The current market price has risen to sixteen yuan and five jiao, two jiao higher than before.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Foreign Firms, Silk Market Deteriorating</h3>
<p>(Restriction of Japanese Silk Fabric Imports into England) The British silk weaving industry has been flooded with Japanese silk fabrics, which are being sold aggressively at low prices, leading to a sharp decline in the sales of British silk fabrics. The production costs of British silk manufacturers are relatively high, making it impossible for them to compete. With stockpiles piling up, the factories have had to reduce production or shut down, leading to an increase in unemployed workers. Therefore, a joint meeting of the industry was held in Manchester and passed a resolution requesting the government to restrict the import of Japanese silk fabrics or, if necessary, to completely ban their import.</p>
<p>(Continuous Shipment of Shandong Silk Waste to Shanghai) The shipment of Shandong yellow silk waste to Shanghai is quite active. The Qingding Sheng Lun ship of Yantai brought another 236 boxes of long tu wan shou suo zi and other items, which are being stored for sale.</p>
<p>(European Sales of Chinese Silk Increasingly Stagnant) The European and American raw silk markets are both deteriorating due to the impending breakdown of the disarmament conference. Both spot and futures silk are seeing no inquiries. The price of New York Yokogawa silk has been falling sharply. No telegrams are being sent for Chinese silk, and sales are extremely sluggish. Yesterday, there was only half a day of trading in the morning, and spot silk trading was completely halted with no transactions reported.</p>
<p>(Artificial Silk Sales Declining) In the past week, the sales of European and American artificial silk to silk merchants have been declining. Yesterday, only Shaohe and other firms purchased 20 boxes of Jin Qilin and Deki brands, first and second grades, with prices ranging from 181 yuan and 2.5 jiao to 160 yuan and 7.5 jiao net.</p>
<h3>Precious Eyebrow Green Tea Sales to England Improve</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the local tea market saw the resumption of trading by foreign tea firms such as Tianxiang Tongfu in Zhenmei green tea from Wuyuan and Northeast regions. The total volume of deals reached over 500 boxes. High-grade teas sold for 127-128 yuan, slightly firmer than before. Gongxi green tea has not yet been traded by Russian firms, but Baitou, Meixing, and Yujiang have all shown interest, and the market is quite active. In addition, Zhongzhuang needle eyebrow teas that have been stockpiled for a long time were traded by Xieyang Industry yesterday. The green tea market is becoming increasingly stable.</p>

<h3>My Observations on the National Games</h3>
<p>— He Wenxin</p>
<p>We can see the enthusiastic situation of this National Games from the large special issues of various newspapers. In the twenty-six track and field events for men and women, a total of twenty-one national records were broken. Can the hat of "Sick Man of East Asia" finally be thrown away?</p>
<p>However, in fact, the good results of this Games cannot be equated with the gradual strengthening of the physique of the national population. First, 100% of the participants in this National Games are students, which means that the majority of farmers and workers are not interested in sports or do not have the opportunity to participate in sports. Second, the men's and women's track and field championships both went to Shanghai, and many inland provinces scored zero points. This so-called concentration of sports athletes in cities and the inability to popularize sports in the interior is also a deformed development of sports. In addition, phenomena such as schools raising athletes as a facade, the general public paying special attention to female athletes, brawls caused by competition for championships, and the habit of athletes not studying can show that sports have become morbid, oligarchical, professionalized, and commodified! It is simply tens of thousands of miles away from the purpose of "promoting sports" and "strengthening the body."</p>
<p>Outdoor track and field sports are indeed a beneficial exercise for the masses to relieve fatigue in their spare time. However, based on the athlete system and championship system adopted by the National Games—and the world—it is really unrelated to the masses and only for the leisure class of men and women to have fun. Strictly speaking, the results produced by this sports system are not only not beneficial to the body but also harmful to the body. Therefore, I believe that we should strive to make sports, which are controlled by a few people, popular and modernized; we don't have to bet on who can break the national record, we just want the national public to have the opportunity to exercise.</p>
<h3>The Snoring in the Toilet</h3>
<p>— Tu Zi'an</p>
<p>Apprentice</p>
<p>I have to get up at five o'clock every morning to sweep the floor, wipe the tables, and get washing water and mouthwash for the masters. After that, I go to the cargo room to carry goods. The weight ranges from one or two hundred jin to three or four hundred jin. I am only fourteen years old, how can I do such heavy work? Even adults can't bear it. But we are donkeys in a harness, and you can't refuse to walk. The cargo room manager is rough, big, and strong. If you are slow, he will yell and hit you. I resisted him a few times and got a few slaps in the face. When I was carrying cotton yarn and cloth ropes a few times, my shoulder blades were swollen very high. The most embarrassing thing is that when the wooden pole presses on the shoulder blades and makes them numb and unaware of pain, the feeling of putting the wooden pole back on the shoulder after a rest is like a wound that has not healed being injured again. Many apprentices cough up blood from the pressure. Once, my waist was sprained from carrying a bag of brown sugar and I lay in bed for seven or eight days before it got better. During these seven or eight days, I couldn't move at all, not even cough. In such pain, no one came to comfort me, and the cargo room manager even said that I was faking and being lazy!</p>
<p>The working hours every day are usually more than sixteen hours, sometimes even increased to eighteen hours. Every day, we start working from five o'clock in the morning and don't go to bed until twelve o'clock at night. We should have especially enough sleep in our childhood, how can we sustain ourselves with only five or six hours of sleep a day? So we often fall asleep while we are standing and working. In the summer nights, although there are many bedbugs and mosquitoes, we don't feel them biting at all, and we fall asleep as soon as our heads hit the pillow. There is also one of the most ridiculous and sad things. One summer night, I went to the toilet to defecate and saw that another apprentice was already inside. I backed out. Later, I waited a long time and didn't see him come out. When I went in to take a look, I found that he was fast asleep and snoring loudly! You think, if he wasn't extremely tired, how could he sleep in the latrine, not avoiding the stench?</p>
<p>There is also one thing that I want to solemnly say, that is, the big managers in the shops often take some apprentices with fair and beautiful faces as their playthings. This kind of thing exists in almost every shop.</p>
<p>Once, I composed a song like this to scold them: "The big manager is the emperor, the second manager is the empress, the concubine in the west palace is XXX, and XXX is the old palace, (eunuch)." This song spread to the manager's ears, and he immediately fired me. Later, after my father gave me a serious punishment, he asked many people to intercede, and the manager finally took me back.</p>
<p>Whenever it rained, I had to pull the cart to deliver goods on the street, walking in the mud. The most dangerous thing is carrying grain bags up a five or six-zhang high springboard. It is common to fall down and die. Every winter, when the weather is too cold, my hands, feet, and face become completely swollen and chapped with large cracks.</p>
<p>When eating, my two eyes are really like the eyes of a thief, looking in all directions. If the managers finish a bowl of rice, you have to get up immediately to get them more rice. If you are not careful, they will give you a contemptuous look. Eight people at a table, taking turns, you don't even have time to eat. You can only eat the side dishes on your side. If you reach for a dish in front of the manager, the manager will angrily throw a bowl of vegetables in front of you. Sometimes, if you say a word of complaint and the manager hears it, a scolding is inevitable: "If you want to enjoy happiness, go home to enjoy it, this is not a nursing home. If you don't like it, hurry up and leave, we don't need anything else, there are plenty of people with two legs!"</p>

<h3>How to Organize an "Amateur Theater Troupe"</h3>
<p>— Ms. Chen Meiqiong</p>
<p>In the previous issue of the Amateur Weekly, we saw an article by Mr. Lin Pingfan "Suggestions for Organizing an Amateur Theater Troupe." Mr. Lin clearly and concisely proposed three key points for organizing an "Amateur Theater Troupe":</p>
<p>(1) To establish a relationship between emerging drama and shop employees and workers.</p>
<p>(2) To make the public aware of drama and establish a permanent foundation for drama.</p>
<p>(3) To provide shop employees and workers with artistic interests with the opportunity to participate in the drama movement.</p>
<p>I am a female shop employee. We are a group that lacks both spiritual and material nutrition. We need emerging art to nourish us, lead us, and progress with the progress of the times. Therefore, "Amateur Theater Troupe" (and all groups of equal significance) is undoubtedly what we need most at the moment. In Mr. Lin's "Suggestions," it has explained the necessity of this organization, but it has not explained how to organize it. After the abstract "outcry," we must come up with a "concrete" design.</p>
<p>Experience tells us that the most difficult part of an unfamiliar job is its beginning, especially in an environment where "professional youth" have no organization. But difficulty is just difficulty, and difficulty can be broken with effort.</p>
<p>First of all, I would like to volunteer to convene a group of "professional youth" who are willing to join and organize the "Preparatory Committee for an Amateur Theater Troupe" to begin preliminary efforts:</p>
