<h3>時評制止四川混戰實</h3>
<p>四川劉氏叔侄内訌血跡未乾而劉文輝鄧錫侯又兵戎在川西劉鄧私兵相持於灌縣汶川之間在南路則在資陽簡陽藥至等處鏖兵同時廿軍楊森廿九軍田頌堯均已紛紛調動部屬準備閉門斫殺而獨據重慶之劉湘則取觀望態度待兩方疲敝以收漁人之利至於挑動川省内戰之真正原因從前雖尙有政治上之解説然其實亦不過借爲爭奪個人權位利禄之口實與整個中國政治變遷之關係絶少試以民國二十二年川閥大小四百七十九戰中除民國五年參加反對袁世凱制運動之役略有政治意味外其他各次戰亂類皆始於爭地盤終於分贓一旦分贓不均即又砲火相見以故劉氏以叔侄之親先有共圖富貴之密約亦不免於一場火併則鄧劉一時之利害結合又烏能久此次川戰發端據鄧錫侯通電一則曰奪我簡城再則曰各項税收被佔領劉文輝更露骨爭奪他盤名曰養兵實以肥已其私鬥之惡烈誠堪浩歎</p>
<p>四川軍閥剥削人民之苛酷一般政治之窳敗匪特爲當世所稀有且覓之往古歷史亦罕有其例如劉文輝防地内徴收田賦原來每年徴收一次者今則每年至少十次其他各軍屬地田賦之徴收亦至少每年在六次以上至於捐税竟多至不可勝計各師長旅長司令等重要帶兵官吏固可以隨意設立局卡任定税率强令民間完納即團長以下凡營連兵單獨駐防者亦多自行巧立名目肆息意苛索至奉有軍部部命令徴收者即可拘拿人民又如成都東門口至望江樓五里之間所設抽税關卡其數不十十五處農民出其血汗肩挑背負以求生活者一擔蔬菜之微亦不免被關卡税吏之需索剿匪徴收特税保商另有樂捐早已成爲四川之習慣日軍侵華於今一年八個月有奇四川固未嘗有一兵一卒見過敵人然而愛國興捐抗日抽税乃已至再至三向民間敲剥矣</p>
<p>四川人民遭此空前的慢性塗毒號稱天府之國殆已地方無餘求生無路自二劉混戰以來一息僅存之川民已恐將悉成餓莩加以鄧劉之爭續起其受禍區域雖不同而戰爭之内容殊無二致簡言之即純粹爲個人爭奪權位與中華民國人民絲毫不相干之私鬭也際此外患煎迫日軍逼近平津而四川軍閥竟不顧民族利益自相殘殺外而騰笑友邦内而破壞國家此種罪過實不可一再寛容中央政府以安内攘外號召天下今將何法以制止之吾人敢爲借著代籌</p>
<p>第一四川軍閥内訌之資本金錢之泉源在鴉片軍械之來路爲宜昌故川閥無論如何兇横絶不敢開罪於控制長江之實力者現在政府果欲制止川戰安撫川民者則惟一要着在乎封鎖宜昌絶不許一滴雅片流出不許一寸鐵塊鋼條及其他有關於軍事工業之原料入川則川戰自必停息</p>

<p>軍縮總委會開會</p>
<h3>美國對安全保障台維斯闡明政策切願參加諮詢公約竭誠贊助英國計畫</h3>
<p>希望成立充分的監視機關但聲明保持行動自由之權</p>
<p>（日内瓦）今日軍縮會議總委員會開會時美代表台維斯發重要演説申述美國對軍縮之意見台氏謂目前之局勢不容再事延宕世界各國今非以偉大精神從事實行一九一九年成立之軍縮政策此種政策吾人必須抒誠承認已爲衆廢棄則吾人必爲自饜計復返於舊日之軍備競爭二者必居其一如採行第二辦法則世界將爲第二次大戰所掃盪此爲必不可免之後果吾人如明白應付此局勢則穏健的世界所應考慮者無他道吾人不能安然置軍縮之切實辦法爲緩途也美國準備與他在軍縮方面有同様進行</p>
<p>其最後之目的應在將軍備縮减至和約所規定之程度易言之即將軍備减至美國國内警備隊之基礎是也美國又準備與他國合作廢除侵略性質之戰具襲撃危險之消滅最足减少戰爭之危險英國之提議乃軍縮之真正計畫吾人竭力贊成之認爲趨向最後目的之一種切實而良好的步驟故吾人完全準備贊助此項計畫之成立美國在助成和平之計畫中願於發現危及和平時商諸他國如會商中之各國判定某國破壞國際義務而决議加諸該破壞國之計畫美國如以此項判斷爲然决不有何行動致妨害恢復和平之共同努力台氏未稱美國以爲必須成立一種充分的監視計畫以保障軍縮之實施美國於此準備有所贊助云台氏又言及現局謂任何國家現不明白表示其和平意旨而堅持其重置軍備之權利者應負軍縮會議失敗之責任又謂德總理新近之演詞極有裨補而使時局發生真正妥妥協之希望美代表團今接受英國計畫之内容希望他國代表亦踵行之下星期乃成敗所繋之試騐吾人未可使自已失敗云云（廿二日路透電）（日内瓦）軍縮會議總委員會明日集會之特點衆料將爲美代表台維斯之重要言論台氏將説明美國願參加英國所提草約中協商公約之程度軍縮前途繋於台氏此次言論者頗鉅蓋若美國準備分負决定侵略者界説之責任及參加此後之制裁辦法則法國之困難爲接受英國草約之障碍者將銷失其半也雖法國已在原則上接受英國計畫與出席之他國同但仍主張保安與軍縮應同時並進並切實管理戰具（二十一日路透社電）</p>
<h3>副揆聲明不干涉主義</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）國務副卿摩萊宣言僅有一種諮詢條約可使美國承認即按約文美國僅參加各國之友好努力以解决纷爭是也若以條約束美國使其以審判員資格出面干涉或對某某國家採取懲罰手段則美國不能參加云（二十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>日軍侵略寗可置不問</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）此間政界意見謂軍縮會議美國代表台維斯本日在内瓦説明美國關於維待世界和平之見解時對於日本軍隊繼續在中國領土内前進一事未必能置諸不問即羅斯福總統與日本代表石井子爵在華盛頓談話時亦未必僅以經濟　題爲限此在日本則以軍縮計劃羅斯福不侵犯公約案歐洲四强條約案均與該國無大關係至台維斯在軍縮會議聞將贊成樹立國際監察制并將提議締結國際諮詢條約但保留美國行動自由之權利而美國在戰爭時抛棄中立權利曁對於侵略國參加軍事經濟制裁兩層則不擬作何决定云（二十一日哈瓦）斯電</p>
<h3>法附條件接授英計劃</h3>
<p>（巴黎）法國民衆報今日聲稱法外長彭古將立即宣佈在原則上接受英國軍縮計畫而附以條件兩條如下（一）軍備必須由國際管理（二）軍縮必逐步爲之如協定成立則法國將擔任停止海陸空軍備之各種新建築如國際管理確定則法國可依允禁止一切攻撃戰具云（二十一日路透社電）</p>
<h3>歐洲和平十年合作四强公約談判進步草約日内卽可簽定</h3>
<p>羅馬意相墨索里尼所提議之四强公約現祗待有關係國之正式同意俟同意後即須設法將英法德意四國之簽字書附載於後聞此公約將於明日（即星期一日）在日内瓦簽第一字（二十一日路透電）（柏林）據確實消息普魯士總理戈林此次之至羅馬雖使四强公約之談判大獲進步然此項談判尙未圓滿告成故該約簽字日期猶未决定（二十二日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）今日下午正式發表英法意德已同意於四强公約草案唯迄今正式接受該公約現有方式者僅意大利一國德國不過由戈林表示德政府之接受可以預定英法則尙保留在日内瓦最後提議修正之權（二十二日國民電）</p>
<p>羅馬頃悉意相墨索里尼在三月底提出之四張公約刻已商得完全同意業將草約送往日内瓦俾四國代表各簽第一字母以資定議聞德代表戈林曾保證德國接受該約　完全合作英法大使亦表示贊同墨索里尼將於星期一二正式官告四國同意並公布該約内容至其正式簽字俟後由四國代表在羅馬開特别會議舉行以昭鄭重據聞此約束縳英法德意四國共同保持歐洲和平十年惟法德兩國究有何種讓步則猶未確悉僅信德國已接受逐漸回復軍備平等之條文而法國則照此情形可允修改和約按此約原係本於凱洛格非戰公約及其他不用武力條約之精神而産生但條約本身及附帶各項辦法均將納諸國聯結精構之内四國現將重申修約原則而德國則將接受逐漸實現之辦法並照約中規定簽約國將與奥匈布及其他歐洲小國成立同様諒解又聞約中訂明關於保持和平之一切處置不問其爲政治問題或非政治問題亦不問單獨施諸歐洲境内或其他境外國家四國之行動應儘量就可能範圍採取共同陣綫衆信此次規定之用意在獲致對於經濟事件滿洲問題及其他間接影響歐洲和平種種問題之合作惟聞目下商定之草約比原來草案已修改多處此約將來簽字後須經各國立法機關之批准並將登記於國際秘書廳云（二十一日國民電）</p>
<h3>與原案大有出入</h3>
<p>（巴黎）四國公約之將早日成立兹已由此所接到之報告證實董意首相墨索里尼普魯士總理戈林法大使佑文納及英大使格蘭姆四氏磋商之結果已獲得意見之完全一致云惟法國報紙對此尙覺極爲愁慮深盻能早知此次羅馬之討論是否以法國備忘録爲根據及此次談話之結果法國是否已經讓步而致其結果遠離法國備忘録之原有地位云法國通信社雖稱已得確訊意首相墨索里尼已將彼原有之提案大加修改以期適合於其他各國之形勢但此種消息尙未能廓清法國國内輿論之恐慌也小曰報稱達拉弟氏之同意於四國公約有一條計即對放各小國之保護應先有適當之保障現法國之態度或已經變更但法國之保留究竟保持到何種地步則尙不可知云至意大利報所認爲四國公約實可增加英國軍縮計劃通過之可能性者法國輿論亦頗表示懐疑之意（二十一日國民電）德意談話</p>
<h3>未涉及奥國問題</h3>
<p>（柏林）德國普魯士總理戈林在羅馬時曾對德國哥龍尼報駐羅馬通信員發表談話謂意國與德國之間絶無所謂奥國問題外間傳説謂予關於此事曾與意大利當局有何談話此種消息實屬荒謬戈林又謂意德邦交極爲良好最近意政府以聖莫利賴柴大十字勛章授與副總理巴本可爲明證戈林結論謂予來意之理由簡單而自然總括言之即希特勒總理之演説造成新局面德國政府欲使新局面能照羅斯福通牒及意相墨索里尼四强條約所指示之方向繼續進展故認爲應派政府要員前來羅馬以資接洽予之來此目的專在於此予與意相墨索里尼從長計議者亦不過此項問題而已（）二十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（華盛頓）華頓官塲聞羅馬傳來四强公約行將簽字之消息後頗爲欣慰認爲國際和諧已有進步之表徴（二十一日路透電）</p>
<h3>英政界大爲驚異</h3>
<p>（倫敦）據羅馬消息關於四强條約計畫之談判業已告成英國政界人士聞訊</p>
<p>之下旣感興趣又覺驚異大衆以爲四强條約計畫最近正由各國外交部互相洽商不料德普魯士總理戈林一抵羅馬談判即有如此進展又謂最近捷克波蘭羅馬尼三國政府對於此事皆已發表宣言辭意堅决四强條約之訂立對於各該國意見旣不能不顧及然則小協商各國不安之心理究意如何竟能使之渙然冰釋是亦大爲可異者也設四强條約真能覓得一種方案使小協商各國及波蘭利益受保障則英國輿論必表歡迎因軍縮會議形勢緩和之後復繼以能調和各方之四强條約於國際大局禆益實多也（二十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>法報紙紛紛評論</h3>
<p>（巴黎）晚間出版之報對德國普魯士總理戈林之赴羅馬與意相墨索里尼與英法大使之會晤紛紛評論時報謂戈林赴意之主要目的定爲四强條約問題該報又謂德國所以突然改變態度者一方由於意相墨索里尼之忠告一方由於受華盛頓宣言之影響時報繼述羅馬談話之進步最後謂四强條約僅爲手續問題絶非具體修改條約且對其他各國之權利及國聯會之職權亦絶不侵犯蓋必如是而後四强維持歐洲和平之長期合作始能持久並發生良好效果也消議報謂現在歐洲方面以絶大之努力求法國之裁軍一般人以爲四强條約之結果不出於修改條約以反對法國之同盟國即終於讓或戰爭其論調較爲悲觀强硬報載稱保障和平之四張條約聞係以十年爲期似業已簽字又謂此訊雖言之過早伹有其確切之根據該報將法國所提之保留加以説明其結論謂意相墨索里尼在其未來之演説中如聲明歐洲四强關係上有所變更則吾人從此如釋重負矣云云二十一日哈瓦斯電</p>

<p>華聯二十二日東京電齋藤首相今日</p>
<p>會高橋財長、據堀切書記官長報告、財長已允留住、政友會之倒閣運動亦可謂已告失敗、至於失敗原因、其内容甚複雜、兹録其黑幕内容如次、（一）政友會内派别甚多、犬養曾評政友會黨情爲小督軍政治、各派爭執甚烈、現在黨内久原派及床次派議員一百多人、不服鈴木節制、除丁灰色議員、即與鈴木均分黨權、此權與軍部及民政黨暗通氣息、擁護現内閣、此爲内部之一大缺點、（二）法西斯派自認自已力量單薄、尙未到單獨執政之時期、上院、副議長與荒木會見後、極力主張維持現狀、即爲此派主張之表現、（三）關東軍反對政友會執政尤烈、如政友會執政、難保没有五一五案第二發生、五一五案公佈後、荒木陸相之談話、確有外呼内應之骨氣、（四）民政黨之最高顧問伊澤多喜男往關西、與反三井財閥之各財閥會見官謀反三井、以財界危機爲名反對政變、因有上列四大勢力之夾攻、政友會之倒閣運動竟陷入重圍、處於此種環境、鈴木亦不敢冒險衝破僵局、功敗於垂成、日政局從此轉危爲安、聞政友會將待九月之編預算時期、以政策問題宣戰云、</p>
<p>華聯二十二日東京電關於高橋財長留住問題、民政黨幹事長談云、從此政局已安定、政府亦可以全力解决中外事要問題、政友會亦應在此期間内恢復政黨政治之信用、國民同冒山道幹事長謂高橋留任、不過爲一時之苟安、九月之預算會議時期、死灰將復燃、政府不該求目前苟安、須退讓賢能、解决内外危機、</p>

<h3>論女子之危機</h3>
<p>此係聶雲臺之太夫人聶曾紀芬告親族</p>
<p>文、載之家庭刋物、見其痛切時弊、有　　裨風化、爰爲轉載、</p>
<p>近來報紙社會新聞、常載女子被人誘騙成姦旋被遺棄之事、大抵女子意志薄弱、不識人情險詐、而近日男女社交公開、易與男子接近、其受欺之由、往往因男子自稱未娶、多方炫惑、夫以更事無多之少女、自易受愚、及旣失身或已懷孕之後、而彼男子者、又已别有所歡、置之不顧、在此種狀况之下、無論用何種手段交涉、其結果則女子恒失敗、即使男子以金錢賠償損失、而女子最可寳貴之貞操、與夫第二生命之名譽、則固已犧牲、無可補救矣、貞操與名譽、女子畢生之幸福繋焉、此豈可以金錢數目計算者哉、</p>
<p>時下最新流行之口號、有所謂婦女解放</p>
<p>者、此實女界之危機也、因要求男女之平等、乃至主張打倒貞操、其意似謂、貞操也者、壓迫女子之枷扭也、打倒貞操、則女子解放矣、或又以貞操爲舊禮敎之産物、故並主張打倒舊禮敎、吾今欲問打倒貞操後、女子果即解放歟、實行打倒貞操者、莫如娼妓、而最不解放者、亦莫如娼妓、</p>
<p>男女以體格生理上之關係、故男正位</p>
<p>乎外、女正位乎内、自有人類以來、男女分工合作、互相倚賴、於以完成今日之社會、在生活原則上、實無所謂不平等、而其間有一最不平等之事實、則孕産乳哺之勤勞、惟女子獨任之、然雖大聖大智、不能解放之也、縱觀世界各國、自崇奉各種舊宗敎者、以至採用最新學説者、其施政及敎育之方法、各有不同、然絶未聞有詆斥貞操者、各國之憲法、則皆有保持善良風化之條文、而貞操者、善良風化之根本也、</p>
<p>宗法社會、在中國今日已不復如前爲人</p>
<p>所重視、然吾人不可誤認、以爲惟宗法社會、乃應重視貞操、蓋家庭之幸福、社會之安寗、與夫民族之强盛、實與貞操有密切重大之關係、故文明各國、皆極思保持之、德國希特勒之焚性書、與各國之禁售淫書、及禁演猥褻影片、皆此物此志也、不圖吾國今日、乃有此種怪誕之新思潮、使一般男女青年、假借自由戀愛之名、以縱其濫交之慾、受害者仍以女子爲多、吾故曰、提倡女子解放、而以打倒貞操爲目標、非女界之福、乃女子之危機也、</p>
<p>就余個人閲歷所得、女子之結婚、仍以由</p>
<p>父母家長代爲選擇爲妥、爲父母家長者、亦宜相當尊重子女之志願、或於其擇偶時、爲忠實之指導、尤要者、於子女將及年時、敎以結婚者應有之知識、吾更望一般青年女子、勿炫於女子開放之美名勿誤解一切自由而身受其害、須知社會輿論制裁之力、遠在一切口號標語之上、女子而有蕩檢踰閑之行、每爲戚族交遊所不齒、不待其見棄於人、而已自絶於社會矣、凡人有所作爲、不能博得知我愛我者之同情、而反遭唾棄、其爲得失、蓋無待煩言矣、</p>
<h3>又一個要自殺者蕪湖周文清君來信</h3>
<p>我本文是一個放牛的竊小子，也曾在初等小學</p>
<p>裏讀過三年書，後來因爲我的爸爸和媽媽要呌我學眼鏡作。不料被時代的潮流，又發明洋金薄片，利息十幾倍，所以我又做新法的眼鏡。在那時每月可得五六十金，最後一日三，三日九，就拆穿了西洋鏡，再加上東洋人這次在上海的一仗，更失去原有生意。現在我住在家裏，是坐吃山空吃光用光，當光，賣光，但是我的爸爸和媽媽，好像知道我養不活他們，也就是長别仙遊了。現在的我呢，還有一個老婆，不幸又養出一個九歲的兒子，同一個三歲的女孩子，幸虧我祖上遺下的二畝山田，（每</p>
<p>畝價約十元）話説這兩畝裏的出産，真可憐得很，只要遇到旱年，就一粒米收不到，所以累到今天，連郵票的錢都没有，先生，該不能怪我打了自殺的觀念吧？在去年的秋季，又有一件使我灰心的事·東借西籌，商得大洋五元，買來銅片做成老式的眼鏡框子，想賺幾個錢，過過新年，誰知有意想不到的苦命啊！利息没有賺到，反失掉平日的伙食費。先生，這一次更加上我的自殺迷夢了！我現在又想從師學業，而我的年紀已快到三十歲了；要想做茶房，廚司，工人，一切的一切，但是没有介紹所，没有好朋友，没有大勢力的親戚，裙帶兒也没有，呌我路走何方？咳！凄慘的命運，爲何落在我的頭頂上！寔在呌在没有解决的辦法，所以特地懇求貴報的顧問先生，指導我一條光明的路！</p>
<p>答··你的來信已經把爲什麽『凄慘的</p>
<p>命運，爲何落在你的頭頂上』的原因説得很明白，這就是手工業被機器工業所吞没，而中國的機器工業又爲帝國主義（資本主義的最後階級的侵略的政治形式）所吞没，所摧毁。你這個『没有解决的辦法』的問題丨失業問題，即在各大城市，各農村中幾百萬，幾千萬的失業的人的共同問題。要從整個的社會問題丨打倒帝國主義及其工具入手，才有辦法，若是單從個人着想，是永無解决的希望的。假使你注意我們的逐日的答覆，你就會看出我們對於此問題的一貫的主張。這並不是我們對你講空話，實在是事實問題。若爲你實際生活着想，到不得已，借個二三塊錢，賣賣花生瓜子，或是呌賣報纸，或則也可以餬口。</p>

<h3>喊</h3>
<p>— 瞻盧</p>
<p>喊，這是我們大中華民國的唯一武器。開什麽抗日大會，舉行什麽示</p>
<p>威運動，一定要喊，一定要大喊而特喊，喊到熱烈的當兒，園孔）直到頸項裏會得發生關老爺般的色彩，哼起了五筋和六筋，額上的汗點子會的滴溜的滚下；但是，除喊以外，比較切實一些的工作，那便没有了！這呌做喊的抗日，喊的救國。</p>
<p>喊的本領，要算西廂記中的惠明最大；他説：喊一喊，厮琅琅振山巖</p>
<p>。』又説：『仗佛力呐』聲喊，繡幡開遥見英雄俺，你看半萬賊兵先嚇破膽。』可惜。惠明的呐喊本領早已失傳；要是，善喊的中華民衆，也學會了他的神通，還怕敵人猖厥麽？旣會喊動山巖，當然也會喊得東京的火山爆發了。旣會呐一聲喊，嚇破半萬賊兵的膽，那麽，違犯華北的敵軍，怎禁得我們連喊幾聲，早已一個個跌下飛機撞下鐵甲車了。</p>
<p>有人説：喊雖没用，還可以表示着一種民氣；現在時局嚴重了，淪亡的</p>
<p>土地愈擴大了，然而，喊的聲浪，一天天的寂滅了，這是什麽現象呢？</p>
<p>我説：喊口號的聲浪，固然寂滅了；喊苦，喊痛，喊天，喊父母，喊兒</p>
<p>女的聲浪，又一天天的濃厚了。我們聽了這喊聲，作何感想？戰地的喊聲，固然是喊苦，喊痛，喊天，喊父母，喊兒女；非戰地的喊聲，又是喊妓，喊五，喊對手，喊再來一個，我們聽了這喊聲，又作何感想？</p>
<h3>向死的路上挺進</h3>
<p>— 火雪明</p>
<p>血花流在塞雪上，紅的喜悦，太陽</p>
<p>照着，月亮也照着，就是黑鉛那様灰暗的雨夜，也隠約飛騰着蓬勃的奇腥。在那裏，軍衣瘞在塵土裏，剌刀埋在拘孿的肉軀裏，戰馬被斫了霜蹄，瘋狂在奔突，鐵鳥巧妙地擲下重量的彈卵，殺氛密集的指揮線内，吹着雄邁的號筒，啼着無助的沉吟，没有花香，没有媚笑，没有濃烈的酒精，没有舒服的野鴨絨毯子，更没有音樂，跳舞，肉的摩擦，：：以至於文化！</p>
<p>然而即使看到聽到的只是荒漠裏的骸</p>
<p>骨，游絲似的呼吸，粗燥的聲音，蒙翳的眼睛，以及鋒烟裏跳躍的靈魂，硫礦裏憤懣和馬匹，這一切都從生的生峰，猛跌到死之深壑；但，不因這幅恐怖的畫圖，就阻止了以文化道德自命的人類的屠殺。而且反加緊磨鋭了大刀，充實前線的犧牲同志，在極端苦難的火焰上慘演出歷史的偉劇。</p>
<p>以甲，胄來防禦飛箭的流射，以鐵腕來</p>
<p>維護自身的安全，以武力來抵抗侵略者的鐵蹄，爲民族，爲公理，爲和平；我們丨中國的人民，應該怎様大無畏地挺進，奮鬭，殺，完成壯烈的死之光榮！　　推開愛人的胸，中國的小姐們！請唱</p>
<p>，請唱桂未谷的詩：</p>
<p>羽檄有郎名，那敢留郎住？莫信鷓鴣</p>
<p>啼，『哥哥行得』去！</p>
<p>不要以爲死是恐怖的名字，人們到頭</p>
<p>會有不可避免的死！要死我們的果然是我們的仇人，但不許我們去死的是和人呢，</p>
<h3>蒺藜</h3>
<p>— 殺羽</p>
<p>越是講究自由戀愛的女子，伊結婚起來，偏附帶許多金錢</p>
<p>問題的條件。和摩豋女郎講愛情神聖，無異對牛彈琴。</p>
<p>假使女子們盡能愛用國貨，力量比除奸團的炸彈，要大十倍。</p>
<p>摩豋女郎能够穿一件國布旗袍，已可稱傑出的愛國女子。</p>

<p>子嘉於日前逝世，有曾爲盧之侍從者，爲述其軼事云：當江浙啓釁，鏖戰劇烈之時，盧患餉絀，知夏超蓄藏綦富，乃召之至督辦公署，向之商假餉費五十萬金，夏靳吝不允，盧愠怒於色，立起欄之，夏羞憤無以自容，及回警廳，召集心腹，齎重金運動張團長倒戈，而與閩孫相通。事旣證實，盧大恐，不暇應戰，急運徙無數木箱，棄臨安而遁走滬上。聞木箱中悉爲珠玉玩好之物，其價值可驚也。盧有母，年逾古稀矣，茹素禮佛，以慈悲爲懷，殊不以乃子爭地以戰殺人盈野爲然，曾一再警告乃子，速即弭兵，以維和平。及盧抵滬，更召之至家、訓之曰：『我家不愁衣食，烏能因</p>
<p>權勢地盤，而重苦江浙百姓。爾若不立刻罷戰，母當死於爾前，代民請命。』盧無奈，乃决計離滬赴日，以事多拂逆故，心緒遂大惡劣。抵滬時，頷下髭鬚猶黝黑有光，不料由滬而别府，而瀋陽，而南京，則黝黑者不三月而蒼白矣。谑者比諸當年伍子胥之過昭關也。</p>
<p>又云：盧遇困難事，輒靜坐一室，以思解决之方法，每日必閲報紙，其閲報也，亦凝神一志以爲之。斯時家人臧獲，咸不能有所禀逹，即禀達，亦充耳不聞也。有新來之侍從，以某事請示於盧，盧方閲報，聞侍從語，略頷其首，侍從以爲已得盧之許可矣，逕自行之，不料事後大爲盧責，侍從以曾請示見允對，盧絶不承認有此，蓋閲報時心不旁鶩，固未知侍從所語爲何也。嗣後侍從有所申述，往往守候其閲報旣畢，始敢上達云。</p>

<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第七回　數語絶恩情閉門痛哭　一肩擔道義酌酒商談</p>
<p>江氏看了他這情形，真有些莫明其妙，手扶坑沿，俯了身</p>
<p>軀，凑着他面前問道：你這是爲什麽？桂枝在身上掏出手絹來擦眼睛，息息率率的哭着，還是不理會母親。江氏道：你説不説出原因來，你再不説，我可急了，你是受了人家欺侮呢？還是别的事情呢？桂枝道：什麽事情也没有。江氏道：什麽事情没有，你爲什麽這様哭閙着。桂枝一想，這話若不和母親説明白了，恐怕母親會疑心到什麽不妙的事情上去。因道：我什麽事情也没有，就是那甘家一家人，狗眼看人低，他瞧我不起。江氏道才明白了，他原來是爲了與甘家閙脾氣，因道：我們早就没有和他來往了，你怎麽還會和他們閙脾氣呢？桂枝只用手絹擦着眼涙，並没有作聲。江氏道：這可怪了，久無來往的人，你倒會因爲他們這様哭起來，這也没有什麽關係，以後，們永不來往就是了。爲了他們來哭，那犯得着嗎？桂枝怎様好去答復他這句話，只有繼續的忍住了眼涙，低了頭坐在坑上。可是他這様受氣，江氏心裏却很快活，他以爲桂枝所以不願意答應趙連長的婚姻，就是爲了有個甘二爺把他牽制住了。現在甘二爺和他斷絶了來往，再要提趙家的婚事，他也就不再推辭的了。江氏如此想着，心中倒反而十分歡喜。書天他也不説什麽，過了一天，他閑閑的和桂枝談話，又説起趙連長爲人甚好，看看桂枝的態度如何？桂枝雖没有加以贊成，却也不加以反對，只是微微一笑。江氏看了這種情形，却又增長了幾分把握。過了一天，江氏等着趙連長回家來了，便裝着來打聽關連長。到後院裏來和他談話。趙自强笑道：老太太打聽關大哥，這算打聽着了。我今天請把兄弟在家裏喝春飲，回頭來了，我讓他到府上去坐罷。</p>
<h3>上海人的痰</h3>
<p>— 持佛</p>
<p>『馬路如虎口，當中不可走，』這是</p>
<p>『上海指南』裏的一句格言，怕死要性命的朋友，誰也不敢不奉爲金科玉律。其實，上海地方雖然黄金滿地，也是危機滿地：流彈啦，强盗啦，綁票啦　　都不是上海獨多　？汽車固然要殺人</p>
<p>電車强盜，也是要殺人。你老人家一不小心，或者凑凑熱閙，看看女人，兩只眼睛一尋開心，不是後面　過來一輛裝貨汽車，前面便竄出來一輛無軌電車，左是黄包車，右是脚踏車，真弄到進退維谷，退避不及，做了垓下的項羽，來不及自殺，却要被汽車夫駡一聲『屈死』咧丨</p>
<p>小心護慎的朋友，因爲在馬路上已經</p>
<p>明白裭奪了行走自由，那末，只得在水門汀上行施其天賦的『行走自由』，豈知已經找到自由的時候，却不願你老人家安心享受。要是你老人家一不小心，那水門汀上來來往往的朋友，也會向你身上吐口痰，向你面上飛幾點芳唾，他是來盡播送病菌的責任，你老人家何能向他非議，有時候，也許有一口濃痰，從我們大商店的櫃裏，跳了出來，正跳到你老人家的衣上鞋上。也許有一盆餘香勝脂的美人洗臉水，從過街樓上倒下來，醍　灌頂，淋漓盡致，也是你老人家的艷福，今天的奇遇丨除了元末許魯齋明代羅一峯先生以外，誰不羡慕這種『美人之貽』呢。</p>

<h3>湖上新聞</h3>
<p>— 天虚我生</p>
<p>五月十五日黎明，喧傳葛嶺之上，有人自</p>
<p>縊於樹，維肖照相館亟往攝影，其人衣工衣，俯首瞑目，手足俱展，並不吐舌，亦無可怖狀，足見從容就死，未嘗作掙扎也，十七日侵晨，孤山之麓，又有人自縊於樹，維肖亦往攝影，尙在冲洗中，未得見其影片，但聞其人爲中國裝，革履尙新，手黑而面晢白，年可四十餘，時有曳空車過西泠者，喟然顧予曰，吾嘗自縊而不得死，彼能死者猶是福人，吾怪其語因詢之，則停車樹下，坐而言曰，予本輿人，窩仔甚重，一家五口，婦女本以磨锡箔糊　锭爲活，小兒女才五六歲，亦能擘麻串錠，助其成功，近兩年來，迷信鏟除，肩輿亦歸淘汰，八歲之兒，讀於鄉學，九齡之女，　爲人婢，其兄與姊，習爲工而未成，近且失其噉飯之地，吾妻復背我而奔，因覓死，顧爲人救，垂絶而甦，因念瀕死之際，喉管被扼，血脈怒張，其痛苦不可言狀，熟籌死法，殆無安全之途，故不復敢求死，然於毫無生趣之中，以待死日之至，誠難乎其爲人耳，予曰，人但能不畏死卽無事不可爲，上陣殺敵，置生死於度外，必爲大勇，何不從軍，則曰，吾友曾爲之，顧於全軍覆没之際，而獨徼倖生還，腹背洞穿，住醫院三月，備嘗痛苦，復往前綫効命，卒以退防被撤，回復其求死不得之生活，且因殘廢不能曳車，但乘香市，乞錢度日，近已不得所之，故予以爲不得爲僧，然又不得其門而入，爲之奈何，言次適有人雇其車，予欲給以談話之費，顧已捷足而去，因念六通寺所懇蓮社規條，其中實含妙用，吾儕設計，洵不如彼之工且巧也，蓮社之徒，日課惟念佛號，趺坐殿中，以鐘魚爲節，謂之普佛，凡入社者，衣食住由寺供給，月給一元，以終其身，死後則火葬之，同社爲誦佛號三日，是其應享之權利也，至其義務，則但隨衆坐香念佛而已，初甚怪其何以能豢六七十人之多，假定每人月費十元，歲費近萬，從何而致，及聞鳳林寺僧，對其檀越言，經懺師以日計，每衆一元，普佛以堂計，凡七日每衆十六元，予怪其值何殊，則曰，念佛者皆高僧，且一日三課尤辛苦耳。假令孤山葛嶺之鬼以及求死不得之車夫，知此一條生路，必可皈依蓮社無疑，但不知其人社手續又何如耳，曩聞吾姪少華，赴留雲寺請願爲僧，謂非先有戒牒不能容納，而戒牒之由來，予在淮安時，曾代邑令監壇，其初人數近百，經七日後，汰其半，又經七日，留者益少，及至頂上燒香，涕涙滿面時，猶有被斥去者，而學習袈裟上身之儀節，其嚴重尤過於兵操，旣得一牒，謂可雲游五嶽，隨在掛單，實則掛單止許一宿三餐，非若蓮社之豢養其終身也，蓮社之剏，吾甚佩其心計之工，能豢一僧，卽有十五人不致失業，蓋其衣食所需，無不仍賴於人自耕者，春者，樵者，炊者，以至種菜者，磨豆腐者，植棉者，紡紗者，織布者，成衣者，製履者，造蒲團，製香燭者，糞者，薪者，以至火葬用薪，　指而數，賴此，僧之生活爲生活者，胥受間接之賜，而一方由迷信家以過剩金錢，躉購錠箔，付之一炬，賴以生活者，如收錠箔灰者。提煉者，打箔者，磨紙者，種什者，抄紙者，糊錠者，造漿粉者，種麻者，造針者，劈篾者，造纂者，造筆墨者，以及輿者，車者，供奔走者，又何止十五人？然則世上多留一不耕不布不死不活之僧徒，可使三十人不致失業，其功德實無量矣，吾儒洵莫能及，蓋吾當爲十農工商設想，竟莫能如彼者，無怪范仲淹治杭，用爲救荒之策，其智可及，其愚誠不可及也。</p>

<h3>洋米交易旺續漲一角</h3>
<p>昨日洋米市况、頗見挺俏、因福州帮辦胃甚</p>
<p>濃、除暢辦客秈外、對於小絞胃口、亦甚貪辦、而洋商仍有擯持之意、結果由安利售出五百包、祥茂六百包、價開六元七角至七元六角、此價比上週已較大一角、</p>
<p>客秈閩化亦貪、但因存底尙多、來源不絶、天</p>
<p>氣炎熱、貨主均求脱手、故行情祗居平站而已、全日開出江西米一千三百七十包、湖南米一千四百六十四包、其中祗有温台州辦去江西機早三百七十包、餘外盡由閩帮辦、行情則與上週無大出入、</p>
<h3>標粉爲加税説帶起</h3>
<p>昨日粉市上午開盤後、各月份曾見平疲之象</p>
<p>以洋麥報價、回小一二角至四五角不等、因此開價後、較之前週收盤、回落五厘七厘半不等、惟廠户抛售、未見湧暢、大部分且趨觀望、業外之買户、則因天色晴正、亦多未前、故各盤交易、遂覺冷淡也、迨至下午開盤、市氣忽見大佳、謡傳此後洋粉進口、將實行加税、則本粉之地位、彷彿轉　、所以業内外之買氣、逾爲帶起、市面亦步步堅信、不過此種事懇、恐又爲洋粉所束縳、雖本埠有加税之説、北方一帶、反恐多定、則本粉反自絶其生路矣、結果本月份較前週收價回漲一分二厘半、六月份漲一分七厘半、七月份漲一分半、八月份漲一分、九月份漲一分半、十月份漲一分二厘半、</p>
<h3>期麥小有參差</h3>
<p>期麥市面、上午開盤後、各月份均量不振之</p>
<p>象、以天時良好、洋麥之報價又小一二四五角不等、故各月份人心均軟弱不前、七月份因係新貨旺令、人心尤虚、較前週又跌五分、八九月份跌一二分左右、迨至下午開盤、初亦平定、旋因粉市報好、及傳洋粉之加税、所以抛户帶緊、買氣亦稍見暢、市面遂立呈佳象、本月份久未做開、昨收盤開四元二角半、七月份較四分、八月份反大二分、九月份未動、</p>
<h3>油豆餅俱告上漲</h3>

<p>昨油荳餅均呈活潑、豆油生油因貨主扳售、受</p>
<p>胃緊凑、市升角譜、黄豆因來源稀落、有出口帮採辦、見漲三四分、豆餅人心看好、廠餅有温台帮問津、客餅有内地走化、所以一日之間升漲二分、後情如天時無變化、市形尙能盤上、温州新蠶豆由海晏輪運抵兩批、計小粒七十三包、大粒三十包、漳帮因不及奬輪、且别帮無交易、以致未曾買開、此批身份較首批爲次云、</p>

<h3>欺騙</h3>
<p>— 豈凡</p>
<p>欺騙的事體，只好一回二回，縱使是頂笨的人，到後來也不肯回回上當的。所以頂巧妙的</p>
<p>欺騙，是要人家不覺得那是欺騙而甘心來上當。</p>
<p>不過欺騙二字的意義，在這裏有討究一番之必要了。欺騙是否有絶對的意思，卽説一事件</p>
<p>是欺騙了，是否到處人人都覺得欺騙的？比方騙子的騙錢，在受了騙的人，失財之後，知道受欺騙了，而騙子自身也知道是騙人的，那不成問題。倘如和尙的勸人信佛，在和尚自身是真的信佛，也勸得了若善男善女眞心信佛了，這在和尙和善男善女，都不會覺得是欺騙，但由第三個不信佛的人看來，那却是欺騙了。不過這是不必怕的，只要善男善女真心信佛了，縱使勸他們信佛的和尙對佛還有懷疑，他們也不感到是受了欺騙的。</p>
<p>所以欺騙的發生，原因只在於没有信仰，有了信仰，縱使實際是欺騙也便變成不是欺騙的</p>
<p>。因之頂巧妙的欺騙者，先要造成人家的一種信仰，有了信仰，欺騙方能發生出偉大的功能</p>
<p>。耶穌的起死回生，醫治癩病患者，使盲目復明，把一片麵包給數千人當了飯吃等等的奇蹟</p>
<p>，全是有了信仰才能産生的，實際是欺騙，而有了信仰的人會當他千真萬確。</p>
<p>世界上的什麽事情都一様，信用的可貴也就在這一點，商店的招牌所以值錢，就因爲有這</p>
<p>種効力之故。頂大的爲政，也是如此。孔子是個曾經實際從政過的政治哲學家，他説足食足兵民信之矣，而在必不得已而去時，則主張先去兵，再是去食，説自古皆有死，民無信不立。可見治國之道，也是在要把百姓騙得死心塌地，要注重巧妙的騙法。</p>
<p>頂巧妙的騙子，他也有手段騙得你十分相信，直到你受騙以後，還相信不是受騙，别人指點你告誡你，你還會當作謊言的。這様高明的騙術，是可敬的，因爲在受騙的人，可以少些自覺受了騙的苦痛。惟有很笨的騙子是可恨的，他們騙人，人人知道他欺騙，他還會老着面皮，襲用常套手段，再來欺騙，他一點也不了解人家自覺了受騙而仍不能不被騙的苦痛。　　治國爲政，也是如此，倘能照孔子所説，做到騙得了百姓的信仰，自然頂好，否則巧妙的</p>
<p>騙子的手段，總該具有的，希望歷史上古今中外的秉政治或者，不要做那笨拙的騙子。至於</p>
<p>自以爲真誠熱烈，而人仍以欺騙視之，則又是滑稽之尤者也了。</p>
<h3>形式邏輯ＡＢＣ</h3>
<p>— 庶謙</p>
<p>當此形式邏輯還在被認做『法寳』的時代，又住在應用形式邏輯有特</p>
<p>别習慣的國度裏，我們對於形式邏輯的ＡＢＣ，不可不知道一些。</p>
<p>現在且就形式邏輯上所謂『假言推理』</p>
<p>來説罷。比方，我們説：</p>
<p>『糖味甜』。我們如果承認這一個命題</p>
<p>是正確的，那末，『不甜的便不是糖』這一個命題便一定得承認。不過還有『甜的便是糖』和『不是糖便不甜』這兩個命題，我們却不一定必須承認。因爲宇宙之大，甜的東西，不見得一定便是糖；糖以外儘管還有味道很甜的東西存在。這便是『假言推理』上的規律。</p>
<p>但在我們的國度裏，對於這一個規律，應用上却稍有一些習慣上的特别。</p>
<p>比如測字先生的寫字檯上總是大大的寫着三個字，『誠則靈』。我們如依照邏輯上的規律去推則爲：『不靈則不誠』。這就是説，當測字不靈的時候，便是請求測字的不誠。這様推理還不够，我們還得依照我們國度裏的特種習慣，推出：『不誠便不靈』和『靈了便是誠』這兩個命題來。</p>
<p>再，當我們承認『多難興邦』這一個命</p>
<p>題的時候，我們一方面要照規律，推出：『邦不興，則難還不多』這一個命題。</p>
<p>同時，我們還要依照我們的習慣，推出：『難不多，則邦不興』和『邦興則難多』這兩個命題。</p>
<p>再、當有人説出『敵來我决抵抗』這一</p>
<p>個命題的時候，我們自然也要依照規律，推出：『我决不抵抗：那末，敵便不來』這一個命題。單是這様推理，那自然也還不够：我們還得依照習慣，推出：『敵不來，我决不抵抗』和『我决抵抗，那末，敵來。『這兩個命題。』</p>
<p>上面所説邏輯上的規律，大槪知道的</p>
<p>人很多；至於應用上的習慣，或許大家還不曾留意。故特爲提出於此，以便事實上的應用。</p>
<h3>小販</h3>
<p>— 羅洪</p>
<p>掮起一鉛桶的熱粽子，對着埀頭喪氣的妻望了一望，他走出了那低矮的家門；末了他又回過頭去、妻還抬着一雙病得可憐的眼他。他嚥下一口氣，忍住一眶子涙，向弄口了。五年來，妻臉上的憔悴，眼裏的裏愁，一天天濃重起來。如今病了好幾個月，還得每天裏這些粽子。他自已，每到黄昏便掮了出去呌賣，到東方快發白時回來，一天一天地，一年一年地，把肚子哄飽就算了。他走出弄口，拐了彎兒，向每夜走熟了的路走出。許多夜間的小販：賣五香茶葉蛋的，賣八寳飯的，賣白糖蓮心粥的，都先後碰到了。都是每夜見慣的嘴臉，見慣的一副掮着挑着的東西。</p>
<p>這亂烘烘的看厭了的都市他們是一點不關心的，那些跳着飛着閃爍的，雖然包圍着他們，但他們看來好比在别一個世界，離得那麽遠，他們看着有什麽用呢？他們只盼望那些不能上館子去的人，小旅館裏的客人，來跟他們做點生意。馬路上等够了的時候，就走到那些小弄裏，拉起悠長的聲音，呌着他們從不變換的調子。有時候好賣，一夜也可以賺一元半元錢，可是丢本的日子也多咧。一天天過着日子真好像拉　似的。每夜掮了去賣，賺的錢明天能不能飽肚子，誰知道呢？</p>
<p>「白糖：：連心粥一，他自已的聲音停」</p>
<p>下來時，就聽得阿林這個低沉的呌聲。自已的倒也不清楚，聽阿林，今夜好似格外凄切様的，他便默的把鉛桶放下，蹲了身子等著。</p>
<p>「怎麽啦、你？」阿林慢慢的走過來問他。</p>
<p>不行，才賣了四隻，已經是半夜了</p>
<p>。他嘆了口氣。</p>
<p>這麽苦苦的有什麽好處呢，一家子</p>
<p>老是不够飽，債倒多起來了。喂，剛才我又看見兩個地方剥猪　，活不得命，還是幹個吧，我差不多每夜看見。</p>
<p>他望着阿林的尖下巴·想到家裏病了</p>
<p>好久的妻。他們都嘆着氣，汽車拉着的回聲跟無線電的音樂在這寂靜中送來。阿林桃起擔子又走了。他在薄暗的燈光下看着那慢慢移動的黑影，又聽得阿林拉着悠長的聲音喊：</p>
<p>『白糖：：：蓮心粥。』那聲音，他聽去是十分凄切的。</p>
<h3>五奎橋觀演記</h3>
<p>— 李</p>
<p>本月二十日，洪深的近作三部曲之一丨丨五奎橋在復旦劇社公演。這一天剛好是</p>
<p>江灣賽馬的日子，江濟路上的車馬特别熱閙。</p>
<p>但熱閙的是跑馬廳那一邊；復旦體育舘中，雖陸陸續續　來了些人，却直到開幕的哨聲鳴時才勉强凑足了滿座三分之一的看衆。</p>
<p>三時幕開了，佈景和光線都配合得恰好，頗</p>
<p>有點田野的拂曉氣象。</p>
<p>五奎橋是一齣描寫農村生活的戲劇。年來農</p>
<p>村經濟日益崩潰，農民與紳縉地主的鬭爭到處暴發。洪深在這些鬭爭中抓取一個做題材，恰好把握住了時代。『就在這殘夜以至於向晨，就在這曙光熹微以至於東方日出的决定五奎橋命運的幾小時中，我們可以看得見那農民和鄉紳對立着的整個鬭爭的展開的姿態，鄉紳的想保持自已地位，權成而施展出來的種種維鬼城伎俩，和那農民的被壓迫得無略可走而最后迸發的行動。』（説明書最後一段）被壓迫得無路可走而最後迸發的行動，是的確『虎拉列』般的很迅速地在鄉間流行着，雖然『曙光熹　的時期』</p>
<p>則還早一點。</p>
<p>這一回的公演，袁牧之的周鄉紳演得很出色</p>
<p>。余麒麟吳鐵翼的長工，吳懐斌的陳金福，胡會忠的謝先生，楊守文的王老爺爺是成功的。</p>
<p>大保的動作生硬，球鳳太做作一點，李全生演成工人的身份了，而且須是智識份子的工人領袖才會那様神經質。總括説來，導演者對於農民生活的體騐太少，把克苦耐勞的農民長工都</p>
<p>演成曲背鸞腿的怪様子了。</p>
<p>『還是道士打醮那一段最好』，坐在我旁邊的</p>
<p>一位看客説。全劇演完，觀衆情緒一些也不緊張，這是『五奎橋』的最大缺點。羣衆情緒十分激昻時，却忽然冷靜下來，讓珠鳳大保從容對話：鬭爭已經開始，但因要等待球鳳的一聲哭喊，羣衆便不得不直挺挺的蠢立着；這様便把全劇支零割散了！從這裏我們可以得到一個敎訓，當演羣衆暴動時是不適宜加入挿話的。</p>
<p>其餘如呌泥水匠情修石橋，那様小小的河能灌</p>
<p>漑四五百畝田，都有點近於閉門造車，但那是很小的事，容易改正過來的。</p>
<h3>更正</h3>
<p>昨日『著書與敎書』一文，作者『郁達夫』先生</p>
<p>，誤植爲『郭達夫』，特此更正。</p>
<h3>紅蘿蔔鬚</h3>
<p>— ＪＵＬＥＳＨＥＮＡＲＤ作林取譯</p>
<p>紅頰一（續）</p>
<p>這種聲音雖是不高，但因爲繼續不斷的緣故，結局是很覺討厭的。這種看不見的，移動着</p>
<p>的低語，真像鼠子似的，在一心擾亂着室中的靜默。</p>
<p>威奥龍吸着一雙舊拖鞋，在那一行一行的臥床中間走了一會，在這個有脚上搔一下，把那</p>
<p>個的睡帽拿一下，隨後便停在馬梭的床邊，他每晚總要和他説話説到很晚的。平常當别的學生把被窩慢慢地拉上來掩住自已的嘴唇似的，漸漸停止説話了，都已睡着了的時候，這位監學先生却還靠在馬梭的床上，兩肘緊緊地憑着鐵欄，連自已的兩隻手臂發了麻，像有許多螞蟻在皮膚上爬着，一直爬到手指間一様，他都不覺得。</p>
<p>他津津有味地聽着他那些充滿着稚氣的故事，他對他説着種種體已話，使他樂而忘睡。隨後，他因看上了他那温柔明媚的容顏，非常痛愛他起來。這孩子的臉皮嫩極了，好像是一種果肉似的，雖在極細微的空氣變動之下，也看得見那些错雜地散佈在肉裏面的細脈，好像墊在透明的薄纸底下的一張地圖上的綫路一様。並且瑪梭還有一種使人把他當作女孩兒一様愛的動人的態度，那便是無緣無故地突然臉紅一事。同學裏面常常有人把指尖放在他的頰上，又突然收回來，使得他的臉上留下一個白印，一會兒這白印便被一層美　的紅色蓋上了，這紅色很快地擴大起來，好像一點葡萄酒冲在清水裏面一様，由那淡紅的鼻尖一直到那紫色的兩耳變化出許多微微不同的顏色。每個人都可以到他臉上去試試看。瑪梭是肯温和地讓别人來試的。因此别人便給他取上守夜燈，燈籠，紅頰等渾名。他這種能够隨意挑動人家的本領頗引起一班人的羡妬。</p>
<p>睡在鄰床上的紅蘿蔔鬚便是嫉妬他的一。個紅蘿蔔鬚原是細長的淋巴性的小丑，臉上蒙着一層曰灰似的，他雖盡力揑着他那乾枯的臉皮，也不會現出什麽好看的顏色的。况且他那臉上還間或有着幾顆褐色的斑點呢。他恨不得用指甲把瑪梭那紅艷艷的雙頰揑上一些斑紋，或是像橘子皮一般撕開來。</p>
<p>好久以來就不懷好意的紅蘿蔔鬚，這晚等威奥龍走近瑪梭的床舗，他便留心偷聽着，他的疑心也許是有道理的，他要知道監學先生那種偷偷摸摸的態度究竟是怎様來的。他使出了一個小間諜所有的能力，他很可笑的假作打鼾，像煞有介事的把身子翻過來，好像夢魔似的發出一個尖鋭的呌聲，把全寢室的人都嚇醒了，使得所有的被窩都像波浪般的翻動。隨後，當威奥龍走開了，他便把半身伸出床外很氣急的對瑪梭説道：</p>
<p>『兔子丨兔子！』</p>
<p>人家一句話也不回答。紅蘿葡鬚跪起來抓着瑪梭的手臂用力摇着：</p>
<p>『你聽見嗎！兔子！』</p>
<p>兔子好像没有聽見：紅蘿蔔鬚憤怒起來再説道：</p>
<p>這才乾凈啦！：：：你以爲我没有看見你們。你説説看，他没有吻你嗎！你説説看，你</p>
<p>不是兔子嗎！』</p>
<p>他立起身，伸長頸根，好像一隻受着威脅的雄鵝一様，兩隻拳頭握得緊緊地放在床邊。</p>

<h3>罪已詔</h3>
<p>— 天方</p>
<p>古代的皇帝都是聽明的，碰到水旱災祲，以及外宼侵入，一般小民囂囂然</p>
<p>不安其生的時候，就會很慷慨的手下一道罪已之詔，大致是不外乎説一些『朕躬失德累及下民』『萬方有罪罪在朕躬』等等譴責自已在話，昭告天下，以明責任攸關，頗有天下的罪惡都由我來負荷的精神，於是囂囂然和的復歸於平靜，頌禱天子萬年，顧念民瘼，雖然事實上受罪的，還是『萬方』但皇帝不是已在那。裏替我們懺悔了媽。，單就這感激。，就值得安然。，</p>
<p>四千年來，皇帝雖然換了代，從『余一人』一變而爲委員們丨但這心法，</p>
<p>脈相承到現在，從不曾失傳，</p>
<p>現代的元老説，『甲午戰爭，中國打了敗仗，那時便應努力自强，但　　自甲午後，雖得敎訓，而仍不能發憤自强，此種罪過，當由年老的人負其</p>
<p>責任，因當甲午戰時，Ｘ委員長適七歲，那時我個人已三十一歲Ｘ那時年</p>
<p>紀小，當然不記得，我們年紀大記得的，實應該早就鼓吹，喚起全國人去</p>
<p>自强，但我來去鼓吹，罪過實無可逃，』</p>
<p>這一篇話，説來婉委動聽，如棄婦自訴，不由你有點骨蘇蘇地，滿腔没來</p>
<p>由的悲憤，頓覺烟消雲滅，因爲當時的小孩且不必負現在的責有，四十年後的後。生小子自更不必過問。國難的歷史，原如此長，這筆賬還得向愛新覺羅氏清算，情乎是遠在關外，年老負責的人雖已不多，但還不致如百齡以上的難尋，且由他們負責吧。丨</p>
<p>過去的事，我們没法幹，現在的事。我們不必幹，但到四十年後算起失却</p>
<p>『鼓吹』之責來，倒頗懼罪無可逃，但也不要緊，可告訴比我們更年輕的人們。説，我們早被更前一輩的先生們鑑定爲『無政治知識』的，這也可塞責了。且把現在元老的言論熟讀了，到那時，照例的下一道一罪已詔』就得。</p>
<h3>童年的憧憬</h3>
<p>— 貝</p>
<p>我是生長在這麽一個家庭裏。</p>
<p>父親常時説，祖父成家之始，僅僅</p>
<p>分得曾祖四擔毛谷，靠了胼手胝足的耕</p>
<p>種，靠了克儉克勤的小本經商，不但養活了一家人，而且漸漸成了小康，在鎭上雖只能算是三四等人家，而在我們小小的族上，却是唯一的巨富了。</p>
<p>封建勢力籠罩下的故鄉，就是現在</p>
<p>還多着吸吮土老百姓血汗的劣紳地痞，那時祖父是個不識字的全武行，光眼吃了許多白虧，惱得老涙雙流，咬緊牙關，打定把後代的人讀讀書，父親做了一輩子的八股，果然家聲撑起了許多。到了我們這一代，大哥上學不成，二哥三哥四哥更都轉向苦力方面去了，不料父親竟那麽屬望我，他常時説：『綿世澤莫如爲善，振家聲還是讀書。一父親堅要我讀書的目的，自然是在振家聲，升官發財的成分，我倒可以担保很少。伹那時我却死也不願意，寗可沈出蔭凉的</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>學堂，赤了　跟着四哥到山上去刈草放牛。</p>
<p>有一天叔父對我説：『我給你算了</p>
<p>個八字，是一條頂好的讀書運，做旁的事是不會有成就的。』不知的確是他這麽算出的，還是父親慫恿他特爲對我這様説？孩子原是最受奉承的，我見叔父説得這麽津津有味，也就開始憧憬着讀書了，從此我便放下醉心的工作丨刈草放牛，埋着頭專唸『子曰』『詩云』，雖然只見書本是白的紙，黑的字，解義全然不懂。</p>
<p>進高小，是洋學堂了，所讀的書，</p>
<p>却比私塾裏的淺近得多，這才漸漸或到一些趣味。在漫無指導之下，課外還愛看些什麽『學生文藝叢刋』『新文庫』一類的東西；有時也喜愛翻翻老古董，拖長着嗓子在飯後寢前哼誦，儼然像一個小學者。</p>
<p>到了二年級，發生了閲報的興趣，</p>
<p>每次回家，父親是不恥下問的問這問那，一般鄉愿更是圍攏着聽得出神，我便滔滔的開篇，説全國分幾派，誰强又誰弱。暑假放學下鄉，怕没報看，特邀同一位窗友，一個凑一千文，合訂了兩月的省城的通俗小報，記得雖是那麽小小的一種報，却也有副刋，我最愛讀牠。私地憧憬着，將來學問做成了，即使没有事做，住在一個城市裏，過過投稿的生活，不也清高自在麽。</p>
<p>誰知十年以後的今日，果然爬進了</p>
<p>這撈什子的圈套，埋頭在實踐我童年的憧憬了。</p>
<p>説起來我真感到無限的疲乏與無聊</p>
<p>，因爲要投靠活命，不得不絞盡腦汁的寫，不管内容充實不充實，有不有益於社會，大衆，只希望産量豐裕，只希望編輯先生垂青，給我投到一篇，便發表一篇，恨不得全刋的文字都由我一人包做。</p>
<p>因爲感到無限的疲乏與無聊，便滿想擺脱；但在未擺脱以前，又要以此自鳴得意，許多朋友來信問我在上海做些什麽？我的答復是：『筆耕爲生』。有時覺得這算不了堂皇，更要瞎吹一泡曰？『在上海幹文化運動』，這是我多麽的不願意説呵！但是畢竟從我的口裏説出來了。</p>
<p>記得去年本刋曾發表過一篇滄萍君</p>
<p>的『尷𡯓文人』的文章，劈頭彷彿是這麽幾句：『肩不能挑，手不能提，又不能買賣做生涯，這便是文人尷𡯓的總原因�</p>
<p>。』是的，尷𡯓了自已倒不打緊，我所�</p>
<p>最引爲憂慮的還是『空口打哇哇』囉來唆去，絲毫不能生産，究竟何有於社會與大衆？</p>
<p>我想總有擺脱我童年憧憬着的現生活的一天到臨，我正在預備着新的憧憬，較有意義的新的憧憬。</p>

<p>是一個夏天的晚上，天氣雖然不十</p>
<p>分凉，但是·因爲夏雨初過之後，人們</p>
<p>的身心上，確已惑到比較的愉快：</p>
<p>在一個小鎭的西首，學校的隔壁，</p>
<p>一所觀音堂裏汽油燈照得通亮，人啊：男的女的老的少，擁滿了一室，本來一所冷靜而寂寞的觀音堂，平地的這様熱閙起來，不得不使我懷疑，於是，好奇之心，油然而生，便去做了一次觀音堂的巡禮。</p>
<p>原來一個中年的婦人，裝着各人的</p>
<p>口吻，已在紥仙呢？（紥仙是鄉村中一件迷信的事，鄉民欲知祖宗死後情形，輒請老女巫紥仙）説什麽ＸＸ的祖父已在吃隂官司呀！ＸＸ的母親怎様呀！聽的人雖多，但是，聲音一些都没有，其秩序之佳，斷非人力所能致此，在這裏，我不得不佩服迷信力量的偉大。</p>
<p>這鄉民所謂合理而十分信仰的紥仙</p>
<p>運動，一直到下午十一時才宣告完結，據云老巫在二三小時之中，共有六七元之收入，而用，已有ＸＸ處已來預約，她自清明至今，已有了六七百元的總收入，唉：幹粉筆生涯的我，真自愧不如呢！</p>
<p>唉：這種迷信的事，在鄉間，現在正在蔓延着，農民因生活的不安定，受鄉間的壓迫太重，要想藉隂間祖宗的力量，來扶助他一點，於是便有迷信的紥仙之事出現，其動作雖極愚笨，而其内心，所有説不出的悲哀，我們實在不忍加以過分的責備。</p>
<p>不過，在此高唱農村復興的當兒，而農村中，還有如此的怪現象，這究竟是誰之過歟？</p>
<h3>革命的傷痕</h3>
<p>— 貝</p>
<p>因做了『童年的憧憬，』引帶動了我這一段生活的回憶，雖説並不是童年憧憬的罪，但總算是文人的尷𡯓。牠永遠�</p>
<p>會佔據我的腦子一角，牠永遠是我的小小生命的傷痕。</p>
<p>事實是開端於前年冬十月。</p>
<p>想起來，當初雖知那不是出路，也不是正則的生活方式；但連夢也没有夢想到，事實竟是那麽的艱險，猙獰·刻毒，使我而今回憶起來，幾乎有些不自信。</p>
<p>命運估定了窮人的身價，我畢竟没有享受高等敎育的幸福，就在前年初秋的一天破曉，我們被大批的軍警强壓上貨車，運到天通菴遣散了，學校也就撞了喪鐘。從此我便像一隻羽毛未豐的失羣小鳥，開始了飢餓的鬭爭，鬭爭不了了，我曾上過好幾家旅館，機關，去拜訪從没面緣的生朋友，在那些生朋友的猙獰面孔下，我幻想過許多爘爛的夢，『士爲知已者用』，只希冀不全要有『生殖器關係』，『世交友誼』，才能在人生的道上，做一員蠕動的角色。</p>
<p>就在這種意識與場合上，我踏上了</p>
<p>崔巍的外灘一座銀行的四層樓，拜見了我這回憶中的主角。</p>
<p>以預定晚上一二小時工作易換膳宿</p>
<p>的書記名位，進而津貼十二元一月，只説白日添加點編述的工作，我是像打了嗎啡針似的興奮，大塊頭喝中了香賓似的歡樂；朋友們也都爲我稱慶。</p>
<p>正因爲這麽一來，我便成了『萬應靈方』似的被使用，比如拿寫信來講，由擬稿到繕寫，有時還要我拿去寄發，秘書書記役使的各級職務，成了我的龐雜的身價。幸喜主雇旣有娘姨，又有包車夫，而又還没有生養小奶，否則説不定還有拉車，主炊，抱孩等職務的搶負。</p>
<p>雇主看中了我這麽一位大才，大部</p>
<p>份的時間枉費在抄寫上，實在可惜，於　那麽　元的　　　　　　　　　　　奶奶。然而少奶奶那裏會書，又那裏肯書，還不是要我深夜趕工麽。</p>
<p>連我自已也有些疑惑，這様的我竟熬煎到了『一二八』的緊急局勢。這時我已給他編好了兩部書，所以雖然時局是那麽的恐慌，的還搶不了放走我。但是我却住宿的地方都没有了，他是那麽仁慈的以二十五元一月把亭子間租給了戰區逃來的難民，呌我晚上在客堂的角裏搭行舗。</p>
<p>不但我被他佔去了肉體，而且還被他抓去了靈魂。雖然他是滿心稱意我的工作，但閃映在他眼底的我，顯然是一個没靈魂的奴隷，他對我汉有一絲的真情，有的只是一種强笑，看了我的工作</p>
<p>稱意時。有時我因事出去了一歇，他知道了便是一陣白眼，一番奚落。星期日也總有工作吩咐。</p>
<p>事在意中，娘姨同包車夫也瞧不起我，自已去取茶水，往往要打『羅斯』。我</p>
<p>有次一個朋友去看我，分明我在家，他們竟懶得開門，嗤退了，從此朋友不來了，我也不敢再招他們來。</p>
<p>我曾給他擬過好幾通電稿，堂皇地他把牠在報上發表。想盡了主意，他准許了我回家去省親，但是剛回去，他又是函電交馳的催促，説是替我謀就了出路。落難的我，也就中了他的圈套，在第二次踏進他的金門後，我竟拿到過三十二元的月薪，但我畢竟出了逃走的下策。</p>
<p>我相信，在上海是多着這類的主雇</p>
<p>與被雇者，這類的主雇，大率都是高等華人，也是上海的撑柱。而被雇者便是我們這類的尷𡯓文人了。�</p>
<p>逃出來已一週年了的我，眼看着時</p>
<p>代已在爲這類的主雇們掘發墳墓了，我也企盼我這生命的傷痕終有滌蕩一天的到臨。</p>

<h3>我們的出路在那裏</h3>
<p>編者先生；</p>
<p>愚魯的我，今年却也十九歲了。爲</p>
<p>了窮的緣故，僅僅在初中讀了一年，就輟學；我是多麽的不願啊，但是事實是不允許你再求學了。我還想早自立，也許能減沙些父親這付嚴重的負擔。可是現在我進這裏已快三年了，扪心自問，究學得了些什麽？眼見父親是一年年地蒼老起來，而他的負擔，依然這様重；怎不使我焦急？而且事業的前途，又是這様的黑暗，一點希望都没有，隠隠地使我在焦急之外，又加上一層悲哀。先生，這可怎麽好呢？這或者不至我一人如此吧？恐怕青年們誰都會有這無名的悲哀；『　那裏是我們的出路？』這一問題，是普遍好在海一個青年年心裏了。　　先生成者要説我太無勇氣前進的一</p>
<p>個，没出息的青年吧？可是，</p>
<p>先生，冷酷的社會，所給予我的實</p>
<p>在太使人失望了，一切的一切，都十足地顯示着勢利，人情薄得像紙一般，而資本家的榨取壓迫，又是無所不用其極。啊！這社會！這勢利的社會！太使人丨尤其是我們青年丨感到失望。所以我現在十分萬渴望着求學，因爲在另一方面，我更感到學識的不足。時常在閙着恐慌。我的月入，僅僅八只老洋，我自已留了一元，餘數全帶回家去。這智識飢荒，又怎能獲救呢？無疑地我是在徬徨着了！</p>
<p>先生，請你指示我，不要使我在歧</p>
<p>途上徬徨着啊！此請</p>
<p>撰安　金頌星謹上</p>
<p>Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ</p>
<p>編者按：在這萬惡的社會裏，不但</p>
<p>是青年，誰都會感到前途茫茫，而喊着『那裏是我們的出路』。</p>
<p>『我們的出路，難道真的没有了嗎</p>
<p>？有是有的，不過需要我們自已去開闢；現在是滿地荆棘，堆滿了障礙物！</p>
<p>我們的努力，積極的方面，當然要</p>
<p>改造社會。人情勢利，怎様去防止。資本家壓榨，怎様去對付。羣策羣力，團</p>
<p>結奮鬥，以求整個社會的光明。消極方面：我們應當在我們能力之内，在『不爲惡社會所同化』條件之下，求適應於社會。增高自已的學識，當然是適應社會唯一的方法。不過有的時候，或者已經出乎我們能力之外：譬如繼續求學，博覽羣書，呌每月祇賺八塊錢的金君，</p>
<p>就辦不到了。所以我們以爲即此一層，也不必勉强；像金君這様情形，旣經没有錢入學讀書，又没有錢買書；那末你祇須充奮利用機會，如不要錢的本報流通圖書館，以及公司裏本來定閲的報紙等等。世界上不少有學問的人，他們的智識，完全從圖書館裏及報紙上得來的！在奮鬥的時候，用力當然要難些；但是到了成功之後，是一様的。適應社會，徐了學問之外，努力的方向還多。世上儘多成功的偉人，他們並不靠學問呢！</p>
<p>我們的出路，要我們自已去開闢。</p>
<p>改造社會，以求大衆的解决，同時可以解决大衆當中自已。改造自身，以求適應社會。</p>

<h3>五姬的一生（十五）（續）</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>十四　初纞</p>
<p>這一夜柳姑娘簡直不能安睡，在跳舞塲陪着顧經理多吃了幾杯香檳當然也</p>
<p>是一個原因：其後顧經理又一定要多情的送她回來，少不了又跟着他抽了幾口大烟，自然是更加興奮。幸而她説了許多好話將顧經理安慰着回去，總算是饒過了她一夜。然則終於是没有睡着，一夜翻來覆去的不住的嘆氣。這一夜，張文彬的影子，簡直像幽靈似的老在她的記憶裏徘徊，真是氣死人的。其後不知怎的，居然是大爲不安，甚至於覺得漸愧：主要的是不應該不允許他同去看戲，反而背着他和顧經理鬼混。但是她爲什麽會突然如此好心腸起來了呢？就是她自已也認爲可笑，可不是有鬼似的。</p>
<p>第二天，窗幔上現着模糊的白光的時候，她記得曾經睡過一會兒，但，不多久又醒來了。咳嗽了一陣，腦袋覺着漲痛。她喚着荷香説；</p>
<p>『你不是説那姓張的曾經寄過相片來媽？』</p>
<p>『那一位姓張的？』</p>
<p>『不就是昨天來過的那位。』</p>
<p>『啊！這位姓張的，是的，是的。</p>
<p>而彩　不久她在荷香手裏接着一幀照片，立刻認識了昨天那位舉止活潑的青年。</p>
<p>可是看了很久，終於還是一張照片罷了。這時候她移過電話機，决心允许張文　彬重　就來看　，其後她又吩咐荷香説</p>

<h3>三星期的地獄工作（下）</h3>
<p>— 以凡</p>
<p>演員艱險生活之片段金赫蕭自述十年前事</p>
<p>在『魔鬼的高爾夫球塲』，我要表演『擒驢』的一齣。因爲按照劇情，那驢背上掛着一個水</p>
<p>查，裏面的水就是我們一點生命線之所繋，我要表演捉不到那頭驢，以致不得不開槍打他，但那一槍正巧又打在水壺上。天是真熱，我連接表演了十天。白天隂冷的地方，足足有一百六十度。晚上最凉爽的時候，也有九十七度。風吹上來，如同烈火一様。我們要拿大車圍起來，四面遮了厚蓬布，不然熱風吹人身上，人都要枯乾而死了。我在這個地方，住了四個禮拜，從來没有水洗過浴，亦没有換過衣服。每天許多人，平均祇有三加侖水可以喝。表演的時候，因爲天氣熱燥，汗出卽乾，用水澆在身上，水到身上卽乾，於是馮司都漢就吩咐身上澆油。本來澆水的時候，已如身處沸水之中，後來身上澆了油，經了一百六七十度的太陽一燒，身體如像處於油鑊之内，皮膚都煎焦了。後來那匹驢都被太陽活活地晒死了。但是馮史都漢還不見滿足。他生的到底什麽心腸，我們都猜不透了。</p>
<p>『貪心』最後的一幕，是要在『魔鬼的高爾夫球塲』攝的。那處遍地石鹽，巉巉石筍，利如鋒刃。我和高蘭，在那裏打起交手仗來。衣服都撕成布條，打得遍體鱗傷，血跡斑斑。加以石鹽滲入皮膚，痛如刀割。馮史都漢心還以爲不够兇狠，在旁邊怒吼著：『糟透了！重來！你們相打，祇當和我厮打，那或者命使你們起勁一點！』真的，我們人人對於馮史都漢切齒痛恨，他自已亦知道的。這様我們就真的拚起命來，但是馮史都漢總嫌不够味道，還要呌我們一次二次的重演，幾來我真的瘋狂了。可幸全隊之中，祇有馮史都漢一個人帶槍。我那時空手突然跳了起來，撲向馮史漢，口中喊着『我弄死你，你這：：』。馮史都漢向後跳了一步，拔出槍來狂喊道『我開槍了！』謝謝旁邊一位電燈匠，他將我當頭一棒打暈在地下了。不然的話，馮史都漢的槍，凖將我打死！</p>
<p>可喜三星期過去了。一隊的人亦祇剩三四個人了，其餘的一個一個都中了日晒病崦都運</p>
<p>走了。那時我們一個一個都已不成人形，世界上都信我們已全軍覆没，死在死亡谷之中了，報紙上都這様地豋載着。我重回人世，我的妻子已經不認識我了。我弱得立都立不直，遍體疼痛，自頂至踵，没有一處不是傷。後來將養了四星期，纔算從死神手裏沈了出來。</p>
<p>可是我們前後拍了幾十萬尺，都被馮史都漢剪完了，留了幾千尺，在銀幕上，不過放映了十分鐘，這就是『貪心』一片中，關於死亡谷的一段。但是看影戲的觀衆，誰知道當時的千辛萬苦呢？（完）</p>
<h3>影片談評評『蜜月旅行』</h3>
<p>— 星</p>
<p>看了這片的題名，似乎是充滿了甜</p>
<p>蜜的愛情，但是事實上並非如此。片中完全是關於宵小的覬觎和垂涎於『利』的素描。雖然談不到什麽矯正世風，却也比無意識的戀愛片要好得多。我所看到的雷電華公司英國分廠出品。這是第三次了，比較上，也都不呌人失望，可見英國對於電影方面，的確是與日俱進的。</p>
<p>我先介紹這『蜜月旅行』的本事吧。</p>
<p>一隻新夫婦，到蘇格蘭去度蜜月，</p>
<p>丈夫有了一種關於電機方面的新發明，致引起賊黨的野心，打算把那新發明的草圖據爲已有。他們引誘那丈夫出來而加以囚禁，又向他的妻强索草圖，好帶圖出奔，到了倫敦家裏，恰巧好丈夫也從盗窟逃回。不料賊黨又來並用手槍强迫，幸而警察趕到，賊黨被擒。</p>
<p>意識上淺顯，但是映出的時候，錯誤頗多。賊黨如何知道個草圖？在蘇格蘭賊黨怎麽不用武？：：等等一點也没有交代清楚。倒是導演小聰明還好，直述的劇情，旣不用穿挿，却能節外生枝，故作奇筆，呌艱衆突然的緊張一下，的確不錯。佈景帶地方色彩，頗合實情。光線大致可以説一個『好』字。攝影幾個外景特寫，還有可看的畫面，動作也很敏捷，不過大部份的精彩，是分幕的剪接，襄助而成。對白不算太多，不懂英文的人，也可以不覺得乾燥。</p>
<p>表演上，極有幽默色彩，戰重的劇</p>
<p>情用嚴重的態度來演，偏能呌旁觀者忍不住的要笑出來。當然比較上是女主角（作那個賢能之妻的）裴妮泰許姆ＢＥＮＩＴＡＨＵＭＥ最好，不但幾個内心表情的鏡頭是很優美的，他更善於和别人合作，全片的生色，大半是她的功勞。其次飾匪徒的哈羅特赫斯ＨＡＲＯＪＤＨＵＴＨ也非常的好，呌人憐，也呌人惡。一個反派助演角色，居然能勝過男主角，這不是一件容易的事吧？男主角彼得漢寗ＰＥＴＥＲＨＥＮＮＥＮ就談不到什麽優劣。其餘的，更不必提了，不過平均的成績，並不太糟，雖然一些演員，不能生色，却也没有什麽大疵點。</p>
<h3>評鐵騎</h3>
<p>— 燕南</p>
<p>武俠片爲什麽不被人看重？這一個</p>
<p>問題想怕有許多人懷疑着，但你多看幾張武俠片，就可自然的得到解答。差不多的片子，其内容都是如出一轍的，像范明克的幾張另起爐灶的武俠片可以説是例外。我們試看那些普通的武俠片，那一張不是寫一個武士，路見不平，帮助人家大打一陣，結果得到美人垂青，團圓完事？不論穿挿些什麽，故事如何的複雜，而大同小異，實際上『換湯不換藥』而已。</p>
<p>范朋克的改變作風，湯密克斯的引</p>
<p>退，於是乎給了喬治奥勃林一個好機會，呌他成了武俠明星的盟主，新光映的『鐵騎』ＳＭＫＯＫＥＬＩＧＨＴＩＮＧ所謂喬治的新作品，實際上，這片子的攝製，遠在一九三○年，不過内中有大少重攝修改，却是最近加插進去的。</p>
<p>本事當然也和我上面所説的差不多</p>
<p>，盡力在發揚英雄佳人的主義，所以我不寫什麽了。意義除了邪不侵正，英雄奮鬥（？）成功以外，還有仕麽可説呢？　　也許比較可看的，還是技巧吧？</p>
<p>喬治奥勃林ＧＥＯＲＧＥＯＢＲＩＥＮ是主角</p>
<p>，當然也就是片子中心的大英雄，他的武功是我們早已領敎過的，他矯捷勇敢，生龍活虎似的顯出了他渾身的武藝。如果這張影片並没有利用鏡頭蒙眼法欺幻觀衆的話，那末喬治在不少地方，如馬背上竄攀火車等等鏡頭，的確是很名貴而難得的。騎馬馬夫在這片子中，更是佔了最精彩的幾節，作他情人的ＮＥＩＬＯＤＡＹ表演，也極細膩。飾被救女子的ＢＥＴＳＹＲＩＮＧＲＯＳＳ嬌小玲瓏，非常可愛？不過也有過火處。飾警處的那一個人，更把『捕快就是强盗』的身份，形容得無孔不入。所謂幾個匪人，太不像話，根本全是『酒囊飯袋』，當然不是大英雄的敵手，喬治用這些搭擋，雖可以英难的敵手，喬治用這些搭擋，雖可以見出自已的矯健，但是片子方面却大減色。</p>
<p>外景平常，佈景很少，還算過得去。攝影呢，有許多鏡頭，地位，一定是然費苦心，纔能攝得的，可以『説生色』。光線平平。導演却有很特别的貢獻，多半是屬於微小的，所以不便提出詳説，那英雄不多等些時候和被救的女郎結合，而却仍舊與其情人去團圓，這似乎是稍能免俗的地方。（被救女子是一個成人，尙係孩童，亦編劇者的細心）。</p>
<p>總之，爲了要實現萬人敵的大英雄</p>
<p>，殲滅匪徒，大快人心，那末，這張影片是可以當選的。</p>
<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3>『覺悟』的我評</h3>
<p>— 孟淦</p>
<p>故事極不通　表情還可取</p>
<p>我因爲：感到『覺悟』二字的意義，就</p>
<p>覺得不會錯到那裏去，况且還加之以有内政敎育二部電影檢查委員會的特殊褒奬，所以我以爲一定是一部優良的作品。於是我便大有非觀不可之槪。可是不看則可，一看之後，就使我絶對的失望。</p>
<p>在覺悟裏叙述　個青年，愛了一個村姑，又因給另一個摩登女性迷惑了，他就把村姑棄掉，後來這個青年更被那個摩登女性遺棄了。在這種情形之下，於是這兩位主人公，都覺悟了過來。我以爲這種覺悟，不過個人生活上的一些迴波，可以題作『回頭是岸』，還當不起『覺悟』二字的大招牌呀！</p>
<p>至於故事方面，均强加穿挿，巧得不</p>
<p>合事實。許多地方，都是弄巧成拙。還有演員的動作太快，字句排列不一，所以這部片子使人失望了。關於表情方面，還算不錯，各演員都能有真實自然的表情，而以范雪朋爲最好。所以在這裏他們還有些成功。在導演方面，他没有什麽新的技巧，平平而已。</p>
<h3>惠勒何爾賽學女人</h3>
<p>— 羅芬</p>
<p>好萊塢自從曼琳黛德麗改穿了男裝</p>
<p>之後，有許多的明星像安娜史丹等，都效尤起來，大穿其男子衣服，於是好萊塢各衣呌店男服因之銷售一空，而女衣服則銷路驤然減小，好萊塢的二位滑稽朋友惠勒和何爾賽二人在没有到上海來之前，在好萊塢安慰各衣服店的主人，呌他們不要着急，他們二人到衣料店中去買了二套女服，在衣料店中穿了起來，短的裙子，穿在膝蓋骨上，二人手牽手的在好萊塢街上行走，説是替男子們宣傳穿女服，也有許多人像追隨曼琳黛德麗般的追隨着二人拍攝照片，但是惠勒與何爾賽二人在好萊塢宣傳了二天，並没有一個男子肯倣效，他們二人後來也就起程到上海來了</p>
<h3>史登堡在倫敦</h3>
<p>— 炳</p>
<p>功成名就後儘可徜徉山水</p>
<p>著名導演馮史登堡氏，自從去年年</p>
<p>底與派拉蒙公司合同滿期後，即離開了</p>
<p>好萊塢。起初漫遊印度，其後即返歐洲，在德國故鄉逗留了數月，現在又離德而赴英。據倫敦電傳，史登堡已安抵倫敦矣。</p>
<p>史登堡在好萊塢節省下不少的財産，尤其是他導演黛德麗時所得到的進欵。現在他名氣也大了，財也發了，所以　　到歐洲去長期的旅行了，他　　　時，曾收集了許多的現代的雕刻物油畫等。他是個靠藝術吃飯的人，當然是酷愛藝術上一切的東西的。現在他在倫敦，仍舊盡量收集雕刻物及油畫等藝術作品，以補其在加里福尼亞所收集之不足　　據路透電傳，史登堡在倫敦向新聞記者們聲稱：『我在電影界之中至今已二十年。現在擬作一長時間的休息，但並不丢棄影界生活·我將環遊各國，如果我用旁觀的眼力自練而有藝術上的進步之時，我就要回到影界中去，繼續我的未盡的志向』云。</p>
<h3>米高梅公司之兩大貢獻</h3>
<p>— 明德</p>
<p>米高梅公司，自從出了七大明星合</p>
<p>演的『大飯店』後，現在又同時進行兩部</p>
<p>大規模出品。其中被選各明星，亦復個個光芒爘爛。兹將片名與人名分録於後，以供讀者先覩爲快：</p>
<p>第一部片名『夜奔』原名ＮＩＧＨＴＦＬＩＧ</p>
<p>ＨＴ。由七大明星合演：爲約翰巴里穆亞，里昻巴里穆亞，海綸海斯，克拉克蓋勃爾，梅娜洛愛，弗蘭克毛根，與弗蘭喬東。導演爲克拉倫司勃朗。</p>
<p>第二部片名『八點鐘的晚餐』，（原</p>
<p>名ＤＩＮＮＥＲＡＴＥＩＧＨＴ，亦由七大明星合演。除前述之巴里穆亞昆仲外，復有曼蘭特萊漱，華雷司皮萊，史本塞曲賽，琪恩哈羅，與奇恩海曉特等，導演何人，尙未得知。</p>
<p>從這些名字上看來，濟濟一堂，都</p>
<p>是頭等角色，將來開映時，想必能哄動一時啊！</p>

<p>那真像一場夢，在他的懷抱裏舞着華爾兹丨這一場夢她一刹那間就要蘇醒轉來的丨他們</p>
<p>跑舞的時候，居望尼把她挾出甬道，溜到綺麗花園裏。</p>
<p>『居望尼，』安琪拉脱出他的臂彎望着他的面孔寗靜地説，『您現在要家去，您去不去？』</p>
<p>『家？』他示驚疑地問。不過我爲怎麽要家去呢，您的父親很客氣的請我丨</p>
<p>『他没有請您呀。』［安琪拉愁苦地望着他。</p>
<p>『我知道。』他歎口氣。『您完全是對的。軍人遇着女子丨軍人同女子發生戀愛丨女子不</p>
<p>同軍人發生懋愛。』他做一個手勢表示絶望似的。他拉起她的手。他們並肩沿着月光蓋着的花徑走。在噴水池畔他們又停了步，默默無言地。『您看，』居望尼終究在靜默的花隂裏開口了，『我不過來同您話别的呀。我不善於寫信，又因爲筆墨不能傳達我的衷情。』他説着又欺了一口氣。</p>

<h3>Japanese Planes Bomb the Pingmi Highway</h3>
<p>(Beiping) North of Beiping, our troops are defending the Shunyi to Pinggu-Changping line. Although Changping was bombed yesterday, order is still maintained. The situation in Huairou is unclear. East of Ping, our troops are setting up defenses along the west bank of the [Blank] River, forming a river-separated confrontation with the Japanese army. Sanhe has been abandoned. The Grand Canal bridge at Zhangjiawan, twelve miles east of Tongzhou, has been dismantled by our troops. Last night, Japanese troops on the east bank shelled our west bank with over two hundred rounds. Our troops returned fire. Japanese troops have not entered Tongzhou, and order is maintained, but residents inside the city have fled. Last night, the Beining train transported over ten thousand wounded soldiers from Tong to Ping twice. This morning, another five to six thousand refugees arrived, a very tragic situation. (22nd Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) In the Miyun area, Japanese troops have been continuously advancing south of Miyun since yesterday. Their patrols occasionally launch sneak attacks on our various positions.

This morning, five Japanese planes bombed the Pingmi Highway with heavy bombardment. The joining of the Beining and Pinghan Railways on Qianmen Avenue began construction this morning. (22nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The 29th and 31st Regiments of the Japanese army [Blanks] Fortress this morning, and a conflict occurred with the Zhao Dengyu sentries. The frontline is extremely tense. (23rd Morning Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan's troops on the Jitong Avenue passed through [Blanks] yesterday and withdrew to the vicinity of Tong County, deploying defenses along [Blanks]. [Blanks] A small number of troops remained to cover the safe retreat of the majority. Zhang Zizhong and Feng Zhi'an's divisions gathered in safe areas to deploy defenses. A Japanese pursuit team, consisting of over ten armored vehicles, advanced along the Pingyu Avenue. Their vanguard engaged in fierce fighting with Song's troops near [Blanks]. The Japanese army fired over a hundred rounds, and we returned fire with forty rounds. (23rd) (Beiping) According to a Tongzhou telegram, Japanese troops are now over ten miles away from Tongzhou. The entire city hears the sounds of artillery from the front. Two shells landed at the station. Our troops have been retreating for days, and the Japanese army is advancing, making the situation tense. Our side has decided that if the Japanese army continues to press, each unit will continue to resist within a reasonable range. As of now, any hope for peace talks is almost completely dashed. (22nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Plainclothes troops were discovered north of Tongzhou this morning, and I dispatched a team to disperse them. (22nd Dispatch) (Beiping) Since our troops withdrew from the Baihe River line, the Japanese army has continued to advance, hoping to achieve their goal of occupying Pingjin and expanding the situation. The entire 8th Division of the Japanese army advanced towards Shunyi from Shilibao, south of Miyun, this morning, and local contact has already occurred at the front. The Japanese troops advancing from Sanhe also launched a fierce attack on the Tongzhou area today. Yesterday, they shelled our positions on the west bank of the Baihe River with hundreds of rounds. It was discovered that troops are facing each other across the river. The situation in the defense areas of Binzhi and Lutai is extremely serious due to the repeated advances of the Japanese army. (22nd Dispatch) (Beiping) At 3:50 PM today, Japanese armored troops suddenly appeared in [Blanks], using extremely fierce direct-fire cannons and machine guns, with shells landing near the city. Our troops are guarding the [Blanks] strategic point and resisting fiercely. Many employees of the telegraph and telephone bureaus in the city are hiding in underground bunkers to take cover. At 4:30 PM, three Japanese planes reconnoitered near the Grand Canal and dropped four bombs on the [Blanks] positions. Fierce fighting is still ongoing this afternoon. (22nd Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Building Bridges on the Northern Grand Canal</h3>
<p>(Beiping) According to a Tongzhou telegram, a portion of the Japanese army attacked our Tongzhou North Jiangan River on the night of the 21st. After our unit engaged in a fierce battle for about an hour, it stopped. The sound of artillery was heard in Tongzhou city late at night, and it subsided slightly this morning. The two sides are confronting each other on the Jiangan River. Five to six hundred Japanese soldiers, carrying eighteen cannons, three tanks, and eleven armored vehicles, are attempting to advance through Yan Jiao towards the Grand Canal area. The Grand Canal bridges west of Yan Jiao had been dismantled by our troops in advance. This morning, over a hundred Japanese infantrymen arrived at the area and are rushing to repair the bridges.

<h3>Residents of Tongzhou Fleeing to Beiping</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The local situation is becoming increasingly chaotic, with rumors flourishing.</p>
<p>Some say a truce agreement has been signed, while others say war is about to break out in the outskirts of Beiping. According to unconfirmed reports, Japanese troops are now only five miles away from Tongzhou, but this claim is difficult to believe. The Japanese side calls this claim absurd. Chinese officials say that there are many Chinese troops beyond the five-mile mark from Tongzhou and that no Japanese troops have been detected. A spokesperson for the Chinese officials, in response to the question of why the forward Chinese troops retreated to Beiping, said that the Chinese troops are here to maintain security and order to prevent the disturbances that occurred in Tianjin on Friday night from recurring in Beiping. Chinese people in Tongzhou are still fleeing to Beiping, but the twenty-five foreign missionaries and fifteen senior students of the American Boys' School are still staying in Tongzhou. Beiping and nearby villages are now full of Chinese troops who have retreated from the front. Although the Japanese army has not attacked, the continuous withdrawal of Chinese troops suggests the possibility of a truce. Chinese officials have not expressed any particular concern about the current situation. (22nd Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Rioters in Tianjin Continue Disruptive Actions, Charge to Guangkai Nanwa, Open Fire and Retreat, Japanese Soldiers Enter Chinese Streets to Parade and Demonstrate</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Vigilance has not slackened in this city. Sandbags piled up in areas such as Dongxingshi Market, Qingyanglou in the north, and Huaiqingli under the Xiguan Tatou on the 21st were not removed on the 22nd. Only those on Dongma Road were removed. Dozens of armed Japanese soldiers entered the streets of the southern city on the morning of the 22nd and paraded and demonstrated in front of our defense lines. The concession suddenly imposed martial law in the afternoon, suspending movie showings and prohibiting pedestrians, the purpose of which is unclear. (22nd Dispatch)</p>

<h3>He, Huang, and Others Discussed Military Matters and Agreed on a Comprehensive Plan, Beiping Decided Never to Give Up Voluntarily, Japanese Side Has No Sincerity, Peace Negotiations Have Reached an Impasse</h3>
<p>(Beiping) During the peace talks, the Japanese side put forward four conditions: (1) The Central Army retreats south of the Yellow River; (2) China shall not station troops within eighty li of the Great Wall; (3) Officially abolish anti-Japanese organizations; (4) Chinese military authorities apologize to Japan. Our side resolutely rejects their unreasonable demands. The Japanese still say that we have no sincerity, and the peace talks have broken down. (23rd Morning Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Last night, various generals, He Yingqin, Huang Fu, and others held a meeting at the Juren Hall. The result was still to uphold the principle of negotiating while resisting, and to support it to the end. Since negotiations have made no progress, we must resolutely resist and never voluntarily give up Pingjin. Even closing the door and defending to the death, fighting with our backs to the city, is what we are willing to do. If necessary, military and political organs will move to the suburbs. (22nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) There are still disputes on both sides regarding the progress of peace: (1) We advocate that Zhang should limit the scope of negotiations to local problems in North China. The Japanese want to take the opportunity to fundamentally resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute and demand submission, such as recognizing the puppet state, designating a certain area as a buffer zone, and banning anti-Japanese movements. (2) We advocate private contact, while the Japanese want public negotiations. (3) We advocate that the Japanese side immediately cease military action, while the Japanese want our troops to withdraw from Ping and Lü first before discussing other matters. It is rumored that the Japanese hope that we will decide on our attitude before the 26th, otherwise, they will occupy Pingjin. This statement is not accurate. Our army has withdrawn to the last line of defense. If the Japanese army advances again, war will inevitably occur. However, Huang is still working hard for peace. (22nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding the issue of stabilizing public sentiment and promoting peace, Huang Fu, He Yingqin, and other military and political figures have conducted thorough research for days. The consensus is that the other party still has no sincerity and is pressing us step by step, making it difficult to begin negotiations. We initially withdrew our troops in pain, considering the fierce fighting on the front lines, the suffering of the local people, and the fear that the public would be terrified at home and abroad. At the same time, we sought to shift from military to diplomatic channels while stabilizing public sentiment. However, the other party deliberately released a peaceful atmosphere to confuse international opinion while continuing to pursue and attack our retreating troops, intending to force us to surrender under threat of force. Therefore, the military side has not stopped, and there has been no progress on the diplomatic side. On the evening of the 21st, Huang Fu, He Yingqin, Jiang Bocheng, Zhang Qun, Wan Fulin, Song Zheyuan, Pang Bingxun, Xu Tingyao, and others gathered at the Juren Hall for a long discussion. Because the other party was full of deception and had no way to proceed, many advocated abandoning peace and waiting for the other party's final awakening. The meeting only discussed military strategies. It was not until about 2:00 AM on the 22nd that the meeting dispersed. In the afternoon, Huang and He invited military and political figures to continue discussing the overall military situation and made a comprehensive plan. Based on the current situation, if the other party does not stop military action, peace negotiations seem hopeless. (22nd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Political Affairs Committee held a discussion meeting at 4:00 PM today, attended by Huang Fu, Wang Kemin, Ding Wenjiang, Tang Erhe, Song Zheyuan, Huang Shaoxiong, and others. Chairman Huang gave a very detailed discussion of the serious situation. (22nd Dispatch) (Beiping) A spokesman for the Ping Army Branch announced on the 22nd that since the beginning of the Rehe War, all actions of our army have been completely based on the central government's intentions and the painstaking effort to maintain East Asian and world peace, so as not to expand the scope of military affairs. Therefore, in addition to defensive and passive actions, no active action has been taken. It is thought that this is the most difficult fact to achieve under the situation of the two armies holding each other, and it is hoped that it will be known and seen by the world. However, in recent months, the Japanese army has repeatedly created excuses for continuous provocations by the Chinese army in order to expand military actions south of the Great Wall, so as to cover up its expansion of military actions to the world. In fact, the actual situation is very different from the facts. Now, our army has withdrawn to the areas around Lutai, Tongzhou, Shunyi, and Niulanshan before the 20th of this month, and according to reports from the front, the Japanese army is still concentrating troops in Lutai, Tongzhou, and Shunyi and continuing to attack us, and using airplanes to bomb various places. It is thought that in the near future, they may again use the excuse of continuous provocations by the Chinese army or other excuses to continue advancing on Pingjin.

<h3>Troops Arriving in Beiping Are Prohibited from Occupying Civilian Housing</h3>
<p>(Beiping) After consultation between He and Huang regarding the various troops that came to Beiping yesterday, it was decided to make proper arrangements. He ordered all troops not to freely occupy civilian housing. (22nd Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Side Threatening with Pingjin</h3>
<p>(Beiping) An embassy staff member said that the Japanese army's current plan seems to be to take a large encirclement of Pingjin, but there is no intention of immediately entering Pingjin. The Japanese side is using Pingjin as a weapon of threat. If they occupy Pingjin, they will lose their tool. Therefore, although the Japanese army is approaching the suburbs, Pingjin may be kept somewhat safe. The Japanese army will not take destructive actions against Pingjin. (22nd Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Wang Says the Compromise Theory Is a Rumor</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang Jingwei told reporters that the claim that China and Japan are about to compromise is purely an attempt by a certain party to deliberately spread an atmosphere. Foreign newspapers did not investigate and took it as historical fact. He asked how China and Japan would compromise. The so-called compromise means that if the aggressor can repent, it can be discussed. The invaded party only knows to resist with all its strength in terms of emotion and situation. The success or failure of the future is not something we dare to calculate. (22nd Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Chen Youren Secretly Discusses Certain Compromise Terms with the Japanese Consul</h3>
<p>In a Hong Kong Hotel</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to a Guangdong dispatch, Chen Youren came south this time and tried his best to win over the Southwest authorities, and the Southwest authorities were happy to use him to try to develop diplomatic relations. Therefore, the Political Affairs Committee had a resolution to appoint Chen as a political commissar. After accepting the appointment, Chen and his wife Zhang Liying and secretary Lin Yougen went to Hong Kong on the 7th, claiming to visit Hu Hanmin to discuss important matters. They arrived in Hong Kong on the evening of the 7th and stayed at room 409 on the fifth floor of the Gloucester Hotel. The name signed at the counter was Mr. and Mrs. Lin, which shows how secretive their itinerary was. On the evening of the 9th, Yoshida Daniichiro, the Japanese consul stationed in Guangdong, immediately followed them to Hong Kong and stayed in room 417 on the fifth floor of the Gloucester Hotel, signing the name (Y. OSIXDER). At 10:00 AM on the 10th, Yoshida went to Chen's room 409 to visit and have a secret discussion for about an hour and a half. During their meeting, all the staff and waiters of the hotel were not allowed to enter the room, and the security was extremely strict. However, the general public suspected that Chen's trip contained the meaning of unilaterally recognizing certain compromise terms with Japan, which has extremely serious implications. After Chen and Yoshida finished their meeting, they immediately returned to the province on the same ship that evening. When a reporter visited him on the ship and asked about his mission to Hong Kong, his secretary Lin Yougen was asked to receive them. According to him, Chen's trip to Hong Kong was to visit Hu Hanmin to discuss the current situation. (22nd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>British House of Commons Questions the Japanese Army's Invasion of Beiping</h3>
<p>(London) When the House of Commons mentioned the Japanese troops advancing to Beiping today, Prime Minister MacDonald did not approve of the suggestion made by a Labor Party member that Britain should propose a truce so that Japan could occupy the land it had occupied, saying that such a move would be inappropriate unless it was the same as the wishes of both parties. Labor MP Jones asked: Can Japan now freely occupy the entire China, and are the Allies and Geneva not protesting? The Prime Minister replied: Of course not. Labor MP Grenfell asked: Has Foreign Secretary Simon known the extent to which Japan's advance in China will reach? British authorities did not comment on this question. (22nd Reuters)</p>
<p>(London) At a meeting of the House of Commons today, Labor MP Rune asked the government not to violate the restrictions stated in the League of Nations Assembly report of February 24 when conducting business negotiations with Japan. He also asked the government not to pursue any independent policies in the Sino-Japanese dispute, but to consult with other members of the League of Nations in order to implement a joint policy. Prime Minister MacDonald replied that there was no discussion on the new Anglo-Japanese treaty at present, and that this matter had nothing to do with the Sino-Japanese political situation.

<h3>The Manchester Guardian Comments on the Far East Situation, China May Surrender to Japan, But the People's Spirit Is Booming and Cannot Be Suppressed</h3>
<p>(London) The Manchester Guardian discussed today the possibility of the Chinese government being subdued by Japanese aggression, saying that the Chinese government should not be blamed for avoiding the great sacrifices in life and money caused by continued resistance. It would not be surprising if the Chinese government's talk of peace was true, but if China made peace in despair, the fault would not lie with China, but with the League of Nations, because the League of Nations only gave China lip service and ordered China to find its own way to recover. Any Chinese government that signs Japanese clauses may not last long, and there is no doubt that the Chinese people will not recognize this as the final clause. (22nd Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Current Affairs Commentary: Stop the Sichuan Civil War in Reality</h3>
<p>The bloodstains of the Liu uncle and nephew infighting in Sichuan have not yet dried, and Liu Wenhui and Deng Xihou are once again at war in western Sichuan. The private soldiers of Liu and Deng are confronting each other between Guanxian and Wenchuan. On the southern route, fierce battles are taking place in Ziyang, Jianyang, and Yaosheng. At the same time, Yang Sen of the 20th Army and Tian Songyao of the 29th Army have also mobilized their troops, preparing to close their doors and kill each other. Liu Xiang, who is solely occupying Chongqing, is taking a wait-and-see attitude, waiting for both sides to be exhausted in order to reap the benefits. As for the real reason for inciting the civil war in Sichuan Province, although there were still political explanations in the past, in fact, it was nothing more than an excuse to compete for personal power and interests. It has little to do with the political changes in the entire China. Taking the 479 large and small battles of the Sichuan warlords in 1933 as an example, except for the battle to participate in the anti-Yuan Shikai monarchy movement in 1916, which had a slight political meaning, the other wars were all started by fighting for territory and ended by dividing the spoils. Once the spoils were not divided equally, they would meet again with artillery fire. Therefore, Liu, as uncle and nephew, first had a secret agreement to seek wealth together, but they could not avoid a fire. How can Deng and Liu's temporary combination of interests last long? This time, according to Deng Xihou's telegram, the cause of the Sichuan War was: "Take my Jiancheng again," and "Various tax revenues have been occupied." Liu Wenhui even more bluntly competed for his territory in the name of raising soldiers, but in reality, he enriched himself. The evil of their private fighting is truly deplorable.</p>
<p>The Sichuan warlords' exploitation of the people is harsh, and the corruption of general politics is rare in the world and rarely found in ancient history. For example, in Liu Wenhui's defense area, the land tax was originally collected once a year, but now it is collected at least ten times a year. In other military territories, the land tax is collected at least six times a year. As for donations and taxes, there are too many to count. Important officers leading troops, such as division commanders, brigade commanders, and commanders, can arbitrarily establish bureaus and posts, set tax rates, and force civilians to pay. Even those stationed independently by battalion, company, and soldiers under the regimental commander often set up their own items and wantonly extorted. As for those collected by order of the military headquarters, they can arrest the people. For example, in the five miles between Chengdu Dongmenkou and Wangjianglou, the number of tax collection checkpoints is no less than fifteen. Farmers who work hard and carry burdens on their shoulders to make a living are inevitably extorted by the tax officials at the checkpoints, even for a small burden of vegetables. The special taxes collected for bandit suppression and the voluntary donations for protecting businesses have long become a custom in Sichuan. The Japanese army has invaded China for one year and eight months, and Sichuan has never seen a soldier or soldier of the enemy. However, patriotic donations and anti-Japanese taxes have been levied on the people again and again.</p>
<p>The Sichuan people are suffering from this unprecedented chronic poisoning. The so-called "Land of Abundance" has almost no place left to survive. Since the Liu civil war, the surviving Sichuan people have been afraid that they will all become starved corpses. In addition, the dispute between Deng and Liu continues to arise. Although the affected areas are different, the content of the war is no different. In short, it is purely a private fight for individuals to compete for power and has nothing to do with the people of the Republic of China. In the face of such foreign troubles, the Japanese army is approaching Pingjin, but the Sichuan warlords ignore the interests of the nation and kill each other, laughing at friendly countries and destroying the country internally. Such a crime cannot be tolerated again and again. The central government calls on the world to "settle internal affairs and resist foreign aggression." What method will it use to stop it? I dare to plan for the author.</p>
<p>First, the capital for the Sichuan warlords' infighting and the source of money are in opium, and the source of weapons is Yichang. Therefore, the Sichuan warlords, no matter how fierce, dare not offend those who control the Yangtze River. Now, if the government wants to stop the Sichuan war and appease the Sichuan people, the only key is to blockade Yichang and never allow a drop of opium to flow out, nor an inch of iron block, steel bar, or other raw materials related to the military industry to enter Sichuan. Then the Sichuan war will inevitably stop.</p>
<p>Second, the major figures in Sichuan are all trying their best to search and scrape, possessing tens of millions of dollars and depositing them in trading ports such as Hankou and Shanghai to prepare for future loss of power and retirement to become wealthy tycoons in foreign fields. Now, if the central government wants to appease the Sichuan people with one anger, it should resolutely order a thorough investigation of the Sichuan warlords' overseas property, and confiscate all those involved in the Sichuan war. If they can do this, they do not need to use force to suppress them. These two points are enough to control their fate. Although the war is currently in a mess, it is not difficult to settle it by issuing an order.</p>
<h3>Ten-Year Road Construction Program in the Three Northeastern Provinces</h3>
<p>(Dalian) The Kwantung Army Special Service Department has prepared a large-scale ten-year road construction program for the Ministry of Transportation of the puppet Manchukuo. It plans to build 4,000 kilometers of roads in the first year and 5,000 kilometers of roads in the second year. Last year, Manchukuo raised 30 million Japanese yen from Japan to fund development, part of which will be used to build roads. The roads that are most urgently needed have been surveyed by the Kwantung Army, and the Manchukuo government is also sending survey teams to various locations to engage in this work.

During the test, copper plates of 15 to 25 centimeters were penetrated by the bullets. (22nd Havas News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Meeting of the General Disarmament Committee</p>
<h3>U.S. Elucidates Security Guarantee Policy on Taiwan, Eager to Participate in Consultative Convention, Wholeheartedly Supports British Plan</h3>
<p>Hopes to Establish Sufficient Monitoring Agency but Declares the Right to Maintain Freedom of Action</p>
<p>(Geneva) At today's meeting of the General Commission of the Disarmament Conference, the American representative, Davis, delivered an important speech outlining the United States' views on disarmament. Mr. Davis stated that the current situation does not allow for further delay. All countries in the world must now, with great spirit, implement the disarmament policy established in 1919. If we sincerely acknowledge that this policy has been abandoned by the masses, then we must either return to the old arms race out of self-satisfaction, or one of the two must happen. If the second approach is adopted, the world will be swept by a second world war. This is an inevitable consequence. If we clearly address this situation, then the only thing a stable world should consider is to avoid delaying the practical measures of disarmament. The United States is prepared to proceed similarly with other countries in disarmament.</p>
<p>Its ultimate goal should be to reduce armaments to the level stipulated in the peace treaties. In other words, to reduce armaments to the basis of domestic police forces in the United States. The United States is also prepared to cooperate with other countries to abolish weapons of aggression. Eliminating the danger of attack is most likely to reduce the danger of war. The British proposal is a genuine disarmament plan, which we wholeheartedly support as a practical and sound step towards the ultimate goal. Therefore, we are fully prepared to support the establishment of this plan. The United States, in plans to promote peace, is willing to consult with other countries when it discovers dangers to peace. If the countries in consultation determine that a certain country has violated international obligations and decide to impose a plan on the violating country, the United States, if it deems this judgment to be correct, will by no means take any action to hinder the joint efforts to restore peace. Mr. Davis did not say that the United States believes it is necessary to establish a sufficient monitoring plan to ensure the implementation of disarmament. The United States is prepared to support this. Mr. Davis also spoke about the current situation, stating that any country that does not clearly express its peaceful intentions and insists on its right to rearm should bear the responsibility for the failure of the Disarmament Conference. He also stated that the recent speech by the German Chancellor was extremely helpful and created a genuine hope for compromise in the situation. The American delegation now accepts the content of the British plan and hopes that representatives of other countries will follow suit. Next week will be a crucial test of success or failure, and we must not allow ourselves to fail, and so on. (Reuters telegram, 22nd) (Geneva) The highlight of tomorrow's meeting of the General Commission of the Disarmament Conference is widely expected to be the important remarks of the American representative, Davis. Mr. Davis will explain the extent to which the United States is willing to participate in the consultation convention in the draft treaty proposed by the United Kingdom. The future of disarmament hinges greatly on Mr. Davis's remarks this time, because if the United States is prepared to share the responsibility of defining aggressors and participate in subsequent sanctions, then France's difficulty in accepting the British draft treaty will be half eliminated. Although France has accepted the British plan in principle, along with other countries present, it still maintains that security and disarmament should proceed simultaneously and that weapons should be effectively managed.

<h3>Deputy Secretary of State Declares Non-Interference Doctrine</h3>
<p>(Washington) Undersecretary of State Moley declared that the only kind of consultative treaty that the United States can recognize is one in which, according to the text, the United States only participates in friendly efforts by various countries to resolve disputes. If a treaty binds the United States to interfere as a judge or take punitive measures against a certain country, then the United States cannot participate. (Havas telegram, 21st)</p>
<h3>Can the Japanese Military's Aggression Be Ignored?</h3>
<p>(Washington) Political circles here believe that when the American representative to the Disarmament Conference, Davis, explains the United States' views on maintaining world peace in Geneva today, the continued advance of the Japanese army in Chinese territory may not be ignored. Even when President Roosevelt talks with the Japanese representative, Viscount Ishii, in Washington, it may not be limited to economic issues. As for Japan, it believes that the disarmament plan, Roosevelt's non-aggression pact, and the European Four-Power Pact have little to do with it. It is said that Davis will support the establishment of an international monitoring system at the Disarmament Conference and will propose the conclusion of an international consultation treaty, but will reserve the United States' right to freedom of action. The United States does not intend to make any decisions regarding the abandonment of neutrality in wartime and participation in military and economic sanctions against aggressor countries.

<h3>France Accepts British Plan with Conditions</h3>
<p>(Paris) The French newspaper "Le Populaire" stated today that French Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour will immediately announce acceptance in principle of the British disarmament plan, with two conditions attached: (1) Armaments must be managed internationally. (2) Disarmament must be carried out gradually. If an agreement is reached, France will undertake to halt all new construction of naval, land, and air armaments. If international management is established, France may agree to prohibit all offensive weapons. (Reuters telegram, 21st)</p>
<h3>European Peace: Ten Years of Cooperation, Progress in Negotiations on Four-Power Pact, Draft Treaty to Be Signed Soon</h3>
<p>The Four-Power Pact proposed by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini in Rome is now awaiting formal agreement from the countries concerned. Once agreed, efforts must be made to attach the signatures of the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Italy. It is reported that the pact will be signed tomorrow (i.e., Sunday) in Geneva. (Reuters telegram, 21st) (Berlin) According to reliable sources, Prussian Prime Minister Goering's visit to Rome has greatly advanced negotiations on the Four-Power Pact, but these negotiations have not yet been fully completed, so the date of the treaty's signing has not yet been determined. (National Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<p>(London) It was officially announced this afternoon that the United Kingdom, France, Italy, and Germany have agreed on the draft Four-Power Pact. However, only Italy has formally accepted the pact in its current form. Germany has only indicated through Goering that the German government's acceptance can be expected. The United Kingdom still reserves the right to propose final revisions in Geneva. (National Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<p>Rome has just learned that the Four-Power Pact proposed by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini at the end of March has now reached full agreement, and the draft treaty has been sent to Geneva for the representatives of the four countries to sign their initials to finalize the agreement. It is reported that German representative Goering has guaranteed Germany's acceptance of the treaty and full cooperation. The British and French ambassadors have also expressed their approval. Mussolini will formally announce the agreement of the four countries on Monday or Tuesday and publish the contents of the treaty. The formal signing will take place later at a special meeting of the representatives of the four countries in Rome to show solemnity. It is reported that this agreement binds the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Italy to jointly maintain European peace for ten years. However, what concessions France and Germany have made are still uncertain. It is only believed that Germany has accepted the gradual restoration of equality in armaments, and France, in this situation, may agree to revise the treaty. This treaty was originally based on the spirit of the Kellogg-Briand Pact and other treaties renouncing the use of force, but the treaty itself and its accompanying measures will be integrated into the League of Nations. The four countries will now reaffirm the principle of treaty revision, and Germany will accept a gradual implementation method. According to the treaty, the signatory countries will establish similar understandings with Austria-Hungary and other small European countries. It is also reported that the treaty stipulates that all measures to maintain peace, whether political or non-political, and whether applied solely within Europe or to other countries outside of Europe, the actions of the four countries should, to the greatest extent possible, adopt a common front. It is widely believed that the purpose of this provision is to achieve cooperation on economic matters, the Manchurian problem, and other issues that indirectly affect European peace. However, it is reported that the draft treaty currently being negotiated has been revised in many places from the original draft. This treaty, once signed, must be ratified by the legislative bodies of each country and will be registered with the International Secretariat. (National Telegram, 21st)</p>
<h3>Great Discrepancies from the Original Plan</h3>
<p>(Paris) The imminent conclusion of the Four-Power Pact has now been confirmed by reports received here. As a result of consultations among Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, Prussian Prime Minister Goering, French Ambassador Jouvenel, and British Ambassador Graham, complete consensus has been reached. However, French newspapers still feel extremely worried about this, deeply hoping to know as soon as possible whether this discussion in Rome was based on the French memorandum and whether the result of this conversation means that France has already made concessions, resulting in a result far from the original position of the French memorandum. Although the French news agency claims to have received confirmation that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has greatly revised his original proposal in order to adapt to the situation of other countries, this news has not been able to dispel the panic of French domestic public opinion. "Le Petit Journal" stated that Daladier's agreement to the Four-Power Pact has one condition, namely that appropriate safeguards should first be in place for the protection of various small countries. The attitude of France may have changed, but it is still unknown to what extent France's reservations are maintained. French public opinion also expresses considerable skepticism about the Italian newspapers' belief that the Four-Power Pact can actually increase the possibility of the passage of the British disarmament plan.

<h3>Did Not Involve the Austrian Question</h3>
<p>(Berlin) German Prussian Prime Minister Goering, while in Rome, told the Rome correspondent of the German "Kölner Zeitung" that there is absolutely no so-called Austrian question between Italy and Germany. The rumor that I had any talks with the Italian authorities about this matter is completely absurd. Goering also said that Italian-German relations are extremely good. The recent award of the Grand Cross of the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus to Vice-Chancellor Papen by the Italian government is clear proof of this. Goering concluded that the reason for my visit to Italy is simple and natural. In summary, Chancellor Hitler's speech has created a new situation. The German government wants to ensure that the new situation can continue to develop in the direction indicated by Roosevelt's note and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's Four-Power Pact, so it believes that government officials should be sent to Rome for contact. My purpose here is solely for this. What I and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini discussed at length was also nothing more than this issue. () Havas telegram, 21st)</p>

<h3>Small Countries Oppose Treaty Revision</h3>
<p>The capitals of Yugoslavia, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Yugoslavia will hold a large demonstration next Sunday to oppose the revision of treaties. Each country will send representatives to participate in demonstrations in neighboring countries. At various gatherings, many people will speak out strongly against the dangers of treaty revision to Europe. (Havas telegram, 21st) U.S. Official Circles Express Gratification</p>
<p>(Washington) The Washington officialdom was quite pleased to hear the news from Rome that the Four-Power Pact was about to be signed, believing that international harmony had shown signs of progress. (Reuters telegram, 21st)</p>
<h3>British Political Circles Greatly Surprised</h3>
<p>(London) According to news from Rome, negotiations on the Four-Power Pact plan have been completed. British political figures were both interested and surprised by the news. The public believes that the Four-Power Pact plan has recently been under discussion by the foreign ministries of various countries. Unexpectedly, negotiations made such progress as soon as German Prussian Prime Minister Goering arrived in Rome. It is also said that the governments of the Czech Republic, Poland, and Romania have recently issued declarations on this matter, with firm wording. The establishment of the Four-Power Pact cannot but take into account the opinions of these countries. How, then, can the uneasy psychology of the Small Entente countries be so dissolved? This is also very strange. If the Four-Power Pact can truly find a solution that guarantees the interests of the Small Entente countries and Poland, then British public opinion will definitely welcome it, because after the relaxation of the Disarmament Conference, it is followed by a Four-Power Pact that can reconcile all parties, which is truly beneficial to the overall international situation.

<h3>French Newspapers Comment One After Another</h3>
<p>(Paris) Evening newspapers commented one after another on German Prussian Prime Minister Goering's visit to Rome and his meeting with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and the British and French ambassadors. "Le Temps" stated that Goering's main purpose in going to Italy was definitely the Four-Power Pact issue. The newspaper also stated that Germany's sudden change of attitude was due on the one hand to the advice of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and on the other hand to the influence of the Washington Declaration. "Le Temps" continued to describe the progress of the Rome talks, finally stating that the Four-Power Pact is only a matter of procedure, not a concrete modification of the treaty, and it absolutely does not infringe on the rights of other countries or the functions of the League of Nations. Only in this way can the long-term cooperation of the four powers in maintaining European peace be sustained and produce good results. "L'Ère Nouvelle" stated that Europe is now making great efforts to seek France's disarmament. In general, people believe that the result of the Four-Power Pact will either be the modification of the treaty to oppose France's allies or the end in concessions or war. Its tone is more pessimistic and tough. "L'Intransigeant" reported that the Four-Power Pact guaranteeing peace, which is said to be for a period of ten years, seems to have been signed. It also stated that although this news is premature, it has a definite basis. The newspaper explained the reservations put forward by France, and its conclusion stated that if Italian Prime Minister Mussolini declares in his future speech that there has been a change in the relationship between the four European powers, then we will be relieved from now on.

<h3>Xinjiang Provisional Provincial Government Established, Jin Shuren Escapes Abroad with Huge Sums of Money, Liu Wenlong and Sheng Shicai Temporarily Take Charge of Military and Political Affairs</h3>
<p>Liu Wenlong, the temporary chairman of the new provincial government in Dihua, telegraphed: "In my previous telegram, I invited you to review the matter. The Hami rebellion began two years ago because former Chairman Jin Shuren used people poorly, which incited the people. Furthermore, because of improper measures, resentment arose among the Hui people. There was already a rebellion of the Yanqi Mongol tribes last summer. By winter, the Turpan and Hui people rebelled, major cities were lost, and the momentum was fierce. The Kazakhs of the Southern Mountains also took the opportunity to stir up trouble. Since January of this year, the provincial capital has been besieged from time to time, and the people are exhausted and demoralized. The Qiande and Fukang areas in the east were successively lost. The Changji, Hutubi, and other counties in the west that were slow to come have also rebelled. As for the south, from Toksun to Yanqi to Luntai to Kuqa to Aksu, U什,喀什, and Hotan, all places are in utter chaos. The Altai region in the north has also been ravaged by the Hui and Kazakhs. The land south of the Tianshan Mountains is no longer peaceful. All sectors are deeply afraid that the territory will be lost and the nation will be divided. Not only is it a disaster for the borderlands, but it is also a concern for the entire country. Compelled by circumstances, there was the political change of April 12. Mr. Jin was unable to resist and fled far away alone. He sent letters to the provincial committees announcing his resignation. He fled to Changji, Suilai, and other counties, and forcibly withdrew 700,000 to 800,000 public funds. When he reached Tacheng, he again took away more than 1,270 taels of gold and public funds stored in Tacheng for the purchase of cars, and spread rumors in an attempt to confuse the public. In summary, the situation is a matter of betraying the country. Now that Mr. Jin has already left the country, we should request the National Government to send personnel to Xinjiang for a detailed investigation to verify the facts. Wenlong and Shicai have been mistakenly recommended by all sectors to temporarily exercise military and civilian administration. All administrative strategies will be based on national law and party principles, adopting public opinion and uniting the feelings of all ethnic groups, hoping to alleviate the central government's worries about the west and do our best to fulfill the responsibilities of the Hui people. The Hui, Hui, Mongol, and Kazakh people who resisted Jin have been earnestly comforted and recruited separately since the establishment of the provisional government. Those who surrendered their weapons and returned to farming are endless. There are also leaders who are stubborn, but their subordinates express their sincerity in surrendering. The situation of the people's hearts being so corrupted can be expected to be brought to an end. If there are those who cannot be sincerely moved or cannot be reasoned with, and military force must be used to resolve them, we will also be lenient with severity and will not be afraid of trouble, mainly to protect the nation and the territory. The road is far away, and communication is difficult. We earnestly ask for your consideration. Liu Wenlong, the temporary chairman of the Xinjiang Provincial Government, and Sheng Shicai, the temporary border defense commander of Xinjiang, kowtow and print (special telegram, 17th)." "Liu Wenlong, the temporary chairman of the new provincial government in Dihua, and Sheng Shicai, the temporary border defense commander of Xinjiang, telegraphed: 'Greetings to all newspapers. A political revolution occurred in Xinjiang on April 12. Jin Shuren, the chairman of the provincial government and border defense commander, was unable to resist and left the province alone, sending a letter to the provincial committee resigning from his position. At that time, the people publicly elected Wenlong as the temporary chairman of the provincial government and Shicai as the temporary border defense commander. Because of their limited talents, they declined three times. The people all blamed each other with righteousness, and public opinion prevailed, so they could not refuse. They have already sworn to take office. Xinjiang is a key area in the northwest and is important both internally and externally. In recent years, the people have suffered deeply. This revolutionary act is purely the will of the people. Wenlong and Shicai were elected after the success to jointly maintain and lead. We will work together to promote progress, taking party principles as our guide and national law as our basis, hoping to alleviate the central government's worries about the west. We are mindful of our limited talents and are fearful of exhaustion. We humbly ask for your clear instructions to follow the political strategies and strive for the benefit of the border situation. In addition to waiting for the central government to select talents, all the details of our assumption of office are telegraphed for your review. Liu Wenlong, the temporary chairman of the Xinjiang Provincial Government, and Sheng Shicai, the temporary border defense commander of Xinjiang, kowtow and shiver (special telegram, 17th).'"</p>
<h3>Chen Shuren Reports on Two Major Issues in Overseas Chinese Affairs</h3>
<p>At the Central Party Headquarters Commemoration Week</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Committee held its 79th Commemoration Week at 8:00 AM on the 22nd. Ye Chucang, Ju Zheng, Chen Lifu, Zheng Zhannan, Wang Qi, Li Zhai, Chen Shuren, and all the staff, about 600 people in total, attended. Ye Chucang presided over the meeting. Chen Shuren reported on the two major current issues in overseas Chinese affairs, saying in essence: "There are two matters concerning overseas Chinese affairs that have recently occurred that have attracted the attention of the Chinese people: (1) After the second coup in Siam, its impact on our millions of overseas Chinese compatriots in Siam is significant. Recently, the Siamese government, seeing that the overseas Chinese have great power in the local commercial sector, has adopted a strict policy, specifically issuing harsh regulations to the Chinese, such as entry regulations, nationality laws, and conscription laws, implementing a policy of assimilation and oppression. As a result, the environment for overseas Chinese is deteriorating day by day. The Siamese government is also colluding with Japan to engage in political aggression. How can we ignore this situation? (2) The expulsion of Chinese in Mexico is becoming increasingly urgent. Four groups of overseas Chinese have been forced to return to China. The government and people of Mexico have a long-standing anti-Chinese sentiment, which began in 1911, but today it is tending to extremes, promulgating so-called labor protection regulations and increasing business taxes for Chinese merchants. Although the Chinese people have paid attention, we must urgently seek remedies to prevent the remaining overseas Chinese from suffering unbearable oppression. In recent months, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission has repeatedly consulted with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and has seriously negotiated with Mexico. An agreement has now been reached and will be submitted to the Executive Yuan in the coming days. As for the returned overseas Chinese from Mexico, the Executive Yuan has allocated funds and sent personnel to Shanghai for relief. Regarding this matter, I feel that overseas Chinese have made great contributions to the motherland, the world, and our party in the past. Recently, we have changed our discriminatory attitude towards overseas Chinese to one of respect. However, we should especially find ways to alleviate the oppression and suffering that overseas Chinese have recently suffered, so that those who have contributed can receive full protection and comfort. telegram, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Reform of the Provincial System Plan Sent by the Ministry of Interior to the Executive Yuan for Review</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The plan for reforming the provincial system, drafted by the Ministry of Interior, has been sent to the Executive Yuan for review. After being sent to the Legislative Yuan for revision, it can be promulgated and implemented. The content of the case is roughly as follows: (1) Determine the provincial government as the entire provincial administrative organ. (2) Determine that the central competent ministries and commissions directly supervise the provincial administrative organs. (3) The powers of the provincial government adopt the enumeration principle. Matters not enumerated that do not belong to the central government should all belong to the county government. (4) The provincial government has one provincial governor as the highest administrative head of the province. (5) The provincial governor is a specially appointed position, nominated by the president of the Executive Yuan and appointed by the deputy director of the Ministry of Interior. (6) The provincial government sets up the following departments: 1. Political Affairs Department, 2. Finance Department, 3. Education Department, 4. Construction Department, 5. Police Affairs Department (if necessary), 6. Land Department (if necessary). (7) Each department of the provincial government has one director. When the provincial governor asks for leave due to business, the director of the Political Affairs Department acts on his behalf. (8) The directors of each department are all selected by the provincial governor from three candidates and submitted to the competent ministry for review and approval, and one is transferred for appointment.

<h3>National Government Weekly Memorial Service: President Wang Reports on Overall Plan</h3>
<p>Hoping that Southwest Central Committee Members will come to Beijing to jointly shoulder the responsibility of national salvation.</p>
<p>(Nanjing) President of the Executive Yuan, Wang Zhaoming, reported on the following outline at the National Government's weekly memorial service on the morning of the 22nd: (1) First, he described the heroic sacrifices of our military officers and soldiers in the Great Wall area since March, as well as the tragic displacement and suffering of the people of North China who exhausted their resources to support the war. (2) Next, he stated that the most important task today is to eliminate traitors and stabilize the political affairs committee stationed in Peiping (Beijing). The most important task of the committee is to unite outstanding individuals from all parties to jointly shoulder the responsibility of national salvation and, at the same time, eliminate traitors with extremely severe measures. (3) He then stated that several Central Committee members in Guangzhou had lightly believed rumors, which the Central Government had already corrected. We not only hope that they will share the difficulties together, but some people now often assume that the Central Government does not have an overall plan. How can the Central Government have an overall plan? The soldiers of North China have been working hard to support the war for more than three months. Some troops in other places cannot be transferred, and some cannot be mobilized. Regarding those that cannot be transferred, such as Jiangxi, some people say why not compromise with the Red bandits? Not only can our military forces be transferred, but their forces can also be used for external defense and regret for communism. This is wishful thinking. As for those who cannot be mobilized, they are all those who enrich themselves with soldiers. Under these circumstances, even if the Central Government has an overall plan, how can it be implemented? Therefore, the only hope of the Central Government for these Central Committee members in Guangzhou is that they all come to Nanjing to jointly shoulder the responsibility of national salvation.

<h3>Nanjing Police Department Holds Summer Review</h3>
<p>Director Chen Zhuo's Speech</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Nanjing Capital Police Department held its summer grand review at Machiao (Horse Mark) at 9:00 AM on the 22nd. Director Chen Zhuo served as the reviewing officer, Chief Inspector Jin Bin served as the commander-in-chief, and Chief of General Affairs Section Chen Youhua served as the chief judge. Participants in the review included eight bureaus, the security team, the patrol car team, the mounted patrol team, the bicycle team, and a female police team, totaling more than 500 people. After Chen Zhuo led the salute, the review began. Afterwards, Chen Zhuo gave a speech, stating that the results of the review showed that the spirit of each bureau and team had not been fully revitalized. Compared with the drills of the military, there was still a long way to go. This was due to the lack of regular training. The duties of the police are significant and rely entirely on a disciplined spirit to serve the public. If the spirit is allowed to be weak and listless, then the heavy mission will not be accomplished. He hoped that everyone would strive harder in the future. (22nd Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<h3>Takahashi Korekiyo's Willingness to Remain in Office May Allow the Japanese Political Situation to Survive for Now</h3>
<p>Fascists Acknowledge Insufficient Strength to Govern; Seiyukai's Cabinet Ouster Movement Fails</p>
<p>China United Press, Tokyo, 22nd: Prime Minister Saitō met with Finance Minister Takahashi today. According to Secretary-General Horikiri's report, the Finance Minister has agreed to stay. The Seiyukai's cabinet ouster movement can also be said to have failed. As for the reasons for the failure, the content is very complicated. The inside story is recorded as follows: (1) There are many factions within the Seiyukai. Inuyukai once commented on the party's situation as a political situation of small warlords. The disputes between the factions are very fierce. Currently, more than 100 members of the Kuwahara faction and the Tokonami faction within the party do not submit to Suzuki's control. In addition to the gray members, they will divide the party's power equally with Suzuki. This power is secretly connected with the military and the Minseitō, supporting the current cabinet. This is a major internal weakness. (2) The Fascist faction believes that its own strength is weak and has not yet reached the stage of governing alone. After the Vice-Chairman of the Upper House met with Araki, he strongly advocated maintaining the status quo, which is a manifestation of this faction's advocacy. (3) The Kwantung Army strongly opposes the Seiyukai's assumption of power. If the Seiyukai assumes power, it is difficult to guarantee that there will not be a second May 15 Incident. After the announcement of the May 15 Incident, Army Minister Araki's remarks certainly had the backbone of external calls and internal responses. (4) The top advisor of the Minseitō, Izawa Takio, went to Kansai and met with various anti-Mitsui zaibatsu to plot against Mitsui, opposing political change in the name of the financial crisis. Because of the attack of the above four major forces, the Seiyukai's cabinet ouster movement was trapped in a siege. In this environment, Suzuki did not dare to risk breaking the deadlock. The effort failed on the verge of success. The Japanese political situation has since turned from danger to safety. It is heard that the Seiyukai will wait for the budget compilation period in September to declare war on policy issues.</p>
<p>China United Press, Tokyo, 22nd: Regarding the issue of Finance Minister Takahashi remaining in office, the Secretary-General of the Minseitō said that the political situation has now stabilized and the government can also fully resolve important domestic and foreign issues. The Seiyukai should also restore the credibility of party politics during this period. The Secretary-General of the Kokumin Dōmei (National League), Koyama, said that Takahashi's remaining in office is only a temporary expedient. The embers will rekindle during the budget meeting period in September. The government should not seek temporary peace but should make concessions to the virtuous and capable to resolve the internal and external crises.</p>

<h3>League of Nations Executive Council Meeting; Mexican Representative Elected Chairman</h3>
<p>Guomin Agency, Geneva, 22nd: The Mexican representative, Najera, was elected today as the chairman of the 72nd session of the League of Nations Executive Council. According to the League of Nations’ alphabetical order of country names, the Japanese representative should have been nominated as chairman, had Japan not withdrawn from the League.</p>
<p>Havas, Geneva, 22nd: The Executive Council of the League of Nations convened at 11 a.m. today. The French Foreign Minister, Paul-Boncour, the British Foreign Secretary, Simon, and the Italian Baron Aloisi, each represented their respective governments. First, a closed-door meeting was held to discuss the petition submitted by the German Jew, Bahn, regarding the status of the Jewish minority in Upper Silesia. The German representative requested that the case be postponed for discussion so that the German government could submit a report on the matter to the Executive Council. The Executive Council decided to move the case to the next meeting for discussion. Subsequently, the Chairman of the Supervisory Committee, Asuski, reported on the financial situation of the League of Nations. Secretary-General Sir Eric Drummond pointed out that the financial situation of the League of Nations was very tight and it was necessary for the member states to increase their contributions. The French representative, Paul-Boncour, replied that it did not seem appropriate at this time to ask the countries to increase their contributions. The Executive Council then held an open meeting and presented the report of the Government Advisory Committee of the Nansen International Refugee Office. Then, the British representative, Eden, presented the report. The Executive Council forwarded to the League of Nations General Assembly the communications from Liberia, Sudan, and China regarding the trafficking of slaves and authorized the Secretary-General to notify the General Assembly of the measures taken by various governments to gradually abolish the trafficking of slaves. Furthermore, the Executive Council, based on the report of the Panamanian representative, Amador, filed the report submitted by the Committee on the Traffic in Women and Children and ordered the Secretariat to prepare for the next meeting of the Advisory Committee. Finally, the Executive Council, based on the report of the Spanish representative, Madariaga, filed similar summaries of the Secretary-General's submissions regarding the two issues of trafficking in narcotics and private manufacture and sale of munitions.</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Works Tirelessly to Address Economic Problems</h3>
<p>Continues to Confer with British Bankers on Stabilizing Exchange Rates; Delegation to Economic Conference Under Careful Selection</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 22nd: President Roosevelt is very busy this week addressing economic problems. According to reports from New York, the U.S. President and the economic advisor to the Bank of England, Sprague, informally discussed currency and exchange matters this afternoon. The establishment of a joint stabilization fund based on a currency truce is one of the main issues under consideration. President Roosevelt has notified the leaders of both houses that he will soon submit a bill to Congress requesting approval to adjust taxes through universal or reciprocal tax cuts. At the same time, the U.S. President is paying close attention to the matter of sending a U.S. delegation to the World Economic Conference. Republican Senator La Follette, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee McReynolds, and the well-known American financier Young are expected to be selected. As the war debt issue becomes increasingly acute, Deputy Secretary of State and Presidential Advisor Moore is likely to remain in the country to provide counsel.</p>
<h3>Papal Organ Praises the Roosevelt Declaration; Economic and Political Efforts Should Work Together to Create Happiness for Humanity</h3>
<p>Guomin, Rome, 21st: The organ of the Roman Catholic Holy See, the "Osservatore Romano," published an article today welcoming the declarations issued by U.S. President Roosevelt and German Chancellor Hitler, stating that these are the most important texts in today's chaotic world. The declarations of both men are expressed in extremely concise terms and are the result of deep reflection, possessing the power to calm people's hearts. Roosevelt's article is like a breath of fresh air entering the poisonous gas that we have been in for a long time, awakening us. Hitler's declaration is like a good wind blowing away the haze. The two declarations are mutually beneficial, and those who consider them must also consider them together, because their time and spirit are largely similar, which is enough to make future international political changes influenced by the views of both Washington and Berlin. Furthermore, Roosevelt's declaration emphasizes economics, while Hitler's declaration is based on politics. Although the two are proceeding along different paths, their goals are the same: the reduction of armaments and the peace of mankind.</p>
<p>[P The Revolutionary Party's Influence in Cuba Extends</p>
<p>Guomin, Havana, 21st: An Associated Press reporter who inspected the interior of Cuba for a week returned today. He observed that the power of the revolutionary army opposing the current government is growing daily. In rural areas, the revolutionary party and the defense forces often engage in minor battles, but these are concealed in the capital and not reported. Although the revolutionary army has not yet shown signs of large-scale concentration, it has sufficient armaments in many places. In the past week, at least 50 officers and soldiers have been killed in action, while no unit of the revolutionary army has been surrounded and disbanded by the government forces. After each engagement with the government forces, they retreat to replenish and prepare for a second attack. It is said that in a certain place in Camagüey Province, there are a total of 1,400 revolutionary soldiers with sufficient armaments and skilled training. Most of them are stationed in barracks near Morón on the coast, which is very close to the sea mouth. Foreign munitions are imported from this source. Because the nearby coast is now also controlled by the revolutionary army, the Cuban government is obviously unable to prevent enemy munitions from landing in the province. The revolutionary army also occupies many other places, and several are very close to the Gulf of Guacanayabo in the south. In Santa Clara Province, there are many revolutionary squads in the southeast of Santa Clara City, with at least 600 men in each squad. Government troops can only attack isolated revolutionary soldiers. Currently, all major roads passing through the concentration areas of the revolutionary army are heavily guarded, but foreigners can pass through the front lines with proper escort and reach the revolutionary army camp. Even in the capital city, there are secret revolutionary party organs that can introduce newspaper reporters to inspect the interior. Although the Cuban revolutionary movement has openly started, there have been no reports of looting or disturbing the people. Each squad seems to be commanded by senior organs and has excellent discipline. Local business is as usual and not obstructed. According to reliable sources, the revolutionary army's munitions are currently being shipped from Mexico on time, and new recruits are also being recruited abroad. A team is expected to land on a remote beach in a few days, led by General Capote, who fled a year ago. The people in Santa Clara Province are willing to supply the revolutionary army with food and are prepared to enlist.</p>
<h3>This Year's International PEN Congress to Be Held in Yugoslavia; British Representative Prepares to Submit Political Motion</h3>
<p>Havas, Yugoslavian capital, 22nd: This year's International PEN Congress will be held in Dubrovnik, Yugoslavia, and writers from all countries will attend. Some members of the German PEN Center were recently expelled and replaced by National Socialist writers.

However, German writers who have fled to other countries are also expected to attend. This year's Congress will also have a political nature, as the British and Slovenian delegations have prepared to submit a motion condemning the anti-Jewish movement in Germany.</p>

<h3>Sudden Change in the Situation of Pingjin</h3>
<p>Advancing into Miyun and Jixian, Pressing towards Pingjin. Plainclothes Teams Discovered in Tongzhou Area. Large Numbers of Japanese Aircraft Reconnoitered Over Beiping as a Show of Force, Implementing Further Military Plans</p>
<p>The Japanese Intend to Coerce Us into a Treaty under Duress. Beiping Special Dispatch 1</p>
<p>Since the Japanese troops have penetrated deeply, the Japanese side has been proceeding step by step according to their predetermined plan. Our side, considering that the safety of Pingjin concerns the entire nation, has been striving for a policy of consolidation. However, the ultimate limit is to seek peace under the conditions of non-compromise, non-appeasement, and mutual understanding. After Huang Fu arrived in Beiping, he adhered to this policy, followed the central government's intention, and started to handle the matter. The first step was to achieve a ceasefire. The frontline troops have been moving successively to the designated new defense lines since the day before yesterday, and this has now been largely completed, with the majority concentrated in Pingjin. However, while our troops were moving, the Japanese troops suddenly advanced again, invading Miyun and Jixian in the north, advancing westward from Xugezhuang in the east, reaching Tangfang directly, and taking a large encirclement formation against Pingjin. At the same time, they dispatched a large number of aircraft to reconnoiter over Pingjin. Last night, they also incited plainclothes teams to riot in Tianjin. The situation in Pingjin has thus reverted from an atmosphere of relaxation to tension. The Japanese's large-scale threat to Pingjin is nothing more than to force us to make a treaty under duress. The ultimate goal of the Japanese is to ensure the occupation of the three northeastern provinces and Rehe and Chahar. In order to achieve this ultimate goal, they have to display great power and exhaust their ability to deceive, cheat, and intimidate. Although we are in a passive position, we still have our own definite policy. Under appropriate circumstances and conditions, we may still be able to adapt to the situation. However, if they insist on forcing us to do the impossible and subjugating us with force, then we would rather be shattered like jade than remain intact like a tile. We will gather our remaining forces and fight to the death, even at the cost of our lives. Since the large-scale invasion by the Japanese troops, there have been differences of opinion between the civilian and military factions. The civilian faction has been advocating for not going too far and knowing when to stop, while the military faction has been extremely arrogant and domineering, thinking themselves invincible. They will not stop until they have exhausted their desires by deploying troops. Recently, Itagaki, a staff officer from the Army Staff Headquarters, was in Tianjin, carrying out activities. The commander of the Kwantung Army also sent his chief of staff, Yamano, to Tianjin for secret activities. Their intention and plan must be to make us completely surrender before they will stop. After the large-scale intimidation of Pingjin in recent days, the Japanese side has today revealed the necessary conditions for peace: (1) a formal indication of seeking peace; (2) no troops stationed within ten miles of the Great Wall. These conditions are only a part of them, and even this is already felt to be intolerable. Moreover, they are fickle and have never been trustworthy. Colonel Anan, a military attaché of the Emperor of Japan, who carried a major mission, was originally scheduled to arrive in Beiping yesterday, but this was temporarily cancelled. The situation has changed drastically. The Japanese troops, who had stopped advancing, suddenly received an order for a general offensive, and the Tianjin Incident broke out again. Their means of threatening our side have been exhausted. The situation today has reached a most critical juncture. What the future holds is only a matter of moments. Last night, Huang Fu and He Yingqin held late-night discussions, which were quite tense. Generals Song and Pang also cancelled their trip to Beiping. Shang Zhen also went to the front line this morning, which shows the severity of the situation. (Reached on May 20)</p>
<h3>Beiping Special Dispatch 2</h3>
<p>The first step of the Japanese military plan for North China has been completed. After the general offensive from eastern Luan and along the Great Wall, they have successively occupied Luanzhou, Fengrun, Zunhua, Tangshan, Shixiazhen, and other places in the last ten days. Then, their second military plan is gradually extended to Pingjin, and the threatening actions are becoming increasingly active. On the Japanese side, since they have occupied the four northeastern provinces by force, the military expenditure is huge, and the financial resources have already been exhausted. The civilian faction and people in financial circles have also not been without hope for a ceasefire. The previous visit of Yoshizawa to China was quite obvious in its intention, but the attitude of the powerful faction is as stubborn as ever. A group of military men are arrogant and think that there is no room for a peaceful resolution without Pingjin. The authorities of the Army Ministry and the Staff Headquarters are particularly vocal. Major General Itagaki was previously ordered to go to Tianjin and exchanged telegrams with Army Minister Araki. His whereabouts were extremely secret. The Kwantung Army Command has even sent the chief of the staff office, Yamano, to Tianjin to assist. In the recent period, he has become more and more active. His task is to collude with our country's frustrated military men and idle politicians to act as traitors, and to incite unemployed hooligans to engage in activities as much as possible, brewing a new organization in North China. The planning has been going on for more than a day. The public security of Beiping has been closely arranged by the local authorities. Although there were rumors of riots for a time, the result was that they ultimately failed. In Tianjin, due to the relationship with the concessions, it is easy for traitors to hide. A certain Shi was instructed by the Japanese side to secretly organize a plainclothes team of 3,000 people, which carried out a raid from Haiguang Temple last night (the 19th), disturbing Xiguangkai and Balitai areas. The chaos lasted all night, and only this morning (the 20th) did it slightly calm down. These people intend to create a terrifying situation with ulterior motives and are indeed a hidden danger at present. In the Tangshan area, it is heard that there is already an organization of the North China National Autonomous Army. The pseudo-commanders are Du Yi and Li Jiasan, etc., who claim that they will lead their troops to attack Tianjin. They are willing to be lackeys of the tiger, so that the Japanese can have something to shirk responsibility and avoid international attention. It is extremely distressing. Eleven Japanese aircraft came to Beiping in batches and formations this morning (the 20th) at 9:00 AM to reconnoiter. They hovered over the city for an hour and then flew northeast. They did not drop bombs. Our anti-aircraft soldiers only fired a few shots from the top of Jingshan Hill, and the rest were silent. The Japanese aircraft flew very low, at an altitude of 400 meters or more, and were still intimidating. The attitude of the public is more calm than in the previous few times. Since Huang Fu arrived in Beiping, the measures to stabilize the people's hearts are still being planned and have not yet been concrete. The People's Self-Defense Guidance Committee sent five representatives, Zhuang, Du Yuting, Qi Yingfang, Gao Luntang, and Yu Shiyuan, to visit Huang this morning, to state the situation in North China and the opinions of the citizens, and to send a letter to Huang, stating five points of view: (1) Oppose compromise with Japan; (2) The people assist the government in resisting Japan; (3) Unify the supply of the army; (4) Severely punish traitors and reactionaries; (5) Concentrate the people's strength to resist Japan. Huang expressed his acceptance of all of them, and he will handle the issue of resisting Japan in accordance with the central government's intention. Huang also visited various military and political figures in Beiping this afternoon for social greetings after his arrival in Beiping. The Political Affairs Reorganization Committee stationed in Beiping is in full swing in preparation.</p>
<p>Since the frontline armies have been concentrating on their designated positions, the Japanese army has been bombing wantonly in the Miyun area, and our army has abandoned the Jiusongling position and withdrawn to the south of Miyun. The Japanese army on the front of the Beining Railway has advanced to Tangfang. It is rumored that the Japanese army seems to be determined to take Pingjin. The eastern route will attack from the Beining Road and approach Tianjin. The northern route will go straight to Tongzhou from the Miyun line. The western route will take the route through Huairou and other places to cut off the traffic between the PingSui Road, forcing us to make a treaty under duress. Therefore, the means of intimidation have been intensified. The Japanese ambassador to the United States, Debuchi, recently told the United States that he had no intention of occupying Pingjin, which is still a smokescreen. Also, a small part of plainclothes teams was discovered in the Tongzhou area and was quickly defeated by us. The people of Tongzhou fled to Beiping in panic. (Leader on May 20)</p>
<h3>Bloody Battle between Liu and Deng at the Pi River</h3>
<p>Liu Wenhui Convenes Military Conference for Another General Offensive</p>
<p>Tian and Li Send Troops to Help. Deng, Yang, and Luo Will Be Drawn into the Vortex.</p>
<p>Liu Xiang Urges Both Sides to Cease Fire and Await Central Government Resolution</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The war between Liu and Deng in Sichuan Province, which started in Wenjiang on the 6th of this month, has been intensifying for ten days. The 24th Army is attacking in four routes. Liu Wenhui appointed Leng Yindong, Chen Hongwen, Lin Haipo, and Chen Qingping as the general commanders of the first, second, third, and fourth routes, respectively. On the 13th, they had partial contact with the 28th Army. On the 14th, they began a general offensive along the Pi River. The 28th Army is defending against the enemy in three routes. The first route commander is Huang Yin, the second route commander is Chen Shulong, and the third route commander is Yang Chongshang, holding the north bank of the Pi River. Deng Xihou is traveling between Du and Chongning, personally taking command. The front line stretches more than 100 miles, from Guanxian in the right, to Qinggangshu in the left, passing through Chongning, Jinmating, Daijiaqiao, Lvxianqiao, and Sandaoyan. The Liu's troops are well-equipped and have a strong momentum. Chongning and Guanxian are under heavy attack, and the intensity of the artillery fire is almost no less than the bloody battle of Luzhou. The two sides fought fiercely for three days and three nights. The Liu's army crossed the river more than ten times, but without success. On the 17th, they gradually entered a state of ceasefire. Because Liu Wenhui failed to conquer repeatedly, he convened a military conference in Chengdu on the 18th, decided to reorganize the positions, and issued a second general offensive order within the day. The Deng's army is also in contact with Tian Songyao and Li Qixiang to seek connection. Tian sent two divisions of Huang Futang and Zeng Nanfu, who have now arrived at Shiyang and Deyang for concentration, commanded by Huang, to join the battle and help Deng resist Liu. Li Qixiang also sent three brigades to concentrate in Yang County to join the first route of the Deng's army, and invited Liu Cunhou, Yang Sen, Luo Zezhou, and others to join the alliance, also appearing to have a large-scale counterattack. The expansion of the Sichuan war is indeed inevitable. After Deng Xihou repeatedly telegraphed Commander-in-Chief Jiang, requesting to stop the advance of the Liu's army, he telegraphed to all parties on the 18th, listing the crimes of Liu Wenhui and the situation of the army's attack and occupation of Wenjian, as well as the recent advances in Pi, Guan, Xin, Jin, Tang, and Zi counties, requesting them to uphold justice and jointly request the central government to punish Liu for causing trouble and devastating the local area. The attitude of Liu Xiang, the commander of the 21st Army, was originally  near. After receiving the telegram from Commander-in-Chief Jiang, he mediated and telegraphed to Liu and Deng on the 17th to cease the dispute. The telegram reads: "Army Commander Liu of Chengdu and Army Commander Deng of Xindu, you are aware, recently I have received reports from the province that the two armies are approaching each other, and wars are starting. The people are shocked and running to tell me. Although the beginning of the trouble, each holds their own opinion, but the start of the war has indeed been realized. At a time when foreign invaders are penetrating deeply, it is time to fight against the same enemy. How can we start a fratricidal war and forget the lesson of fratricide? In addition, the remnants of the Red Bandits in northern Sichuan have not been eliminated, and the people are suffering from poverty. How can we suffer from the scourge of war again? If the war spreads and lasts for a long time, not only will the local area be devastated, but also the bandits will take the opportunity. You are both clear-sighted and do not need to be pointed out. I hope that you can eliminate your grievances and stop the war. Although winning is not brave, the loss of a country is imminent. All my comrades should know to fear, must first abandon their suspicions and make peace, then they can turn danger into safety. Even if there are any difficulties, you should wait for the central government to resolve them. The future of the country depends on this, and I send this telegram to inform you, and I hope you will understand." Liu Xiang kowtows and seals. His true attitude has not yet been expressed. However, Liu Xiang has long had the ambition to unify the whole of Sichuan. The war between Liu and Deng, although not necessarily provoked by him, may not be unwilling to see them both lose. If Liu and Deng do not repent and prolong the war, then Liu Xiang will be able to reap the benefits. (20th)</p>

<p>(Facts)</p>
<p>Chen Duxiu was appointed by the Third International to found the Communist Party in China in the ninth year of the Republic of China, i.e., 1920 in the Western calendar. Peng Shuzhi joined the party in the tenth year of the Republic of China, i.e., 1921 in the Western calendar, and was also appointed by the Third International as a member of the Central Standing Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. Chen Duxiu also served as secretary, jointly implementing the strategies instructed by the Second International, and leading party members in activities in mainland China. Later, due to the death of the Communist leader Lenin, the party was internally divided into the Stalin (i.e., cadre faction) and Trotskyist factions. Party power was seized by Stalin, and Trotsky was exiled to Constantinople. Chen Duxiu and Peng Shuzhi both disagreed with the Stalin faction and leaned towards Trotsky. By the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, they were both dismissed from their positions. In the eighteenth year, they were both expelled from the party. Thereupon, they gathered comrades and organized the Left Opposition of the Chinese Communist Party (hereinafter referred to as the CCP Opposition) in Shanghai. The strategy they adopted was to unite workers, poor peasants, and the proletariat as the foundation for construction, and to oppose the Stalin faction's use of bandits and defeated soldiers to lead rural peasants in armed uprisings under the current situation in China. However, their party had few members and lacked economic resources, so their activities were limited to Shanghai, Tianjin, Hong Kong, and other places, and they could only participate in labor unions and student movements. They were still unable to develop rural peasant associations. The most important work of the party was to use writing for propaganda, such as "School Life," "Spark," "The Proletarian," and "The Uprising Tide," which were all party publications, mostly edited by Chen Duxiu and Peng Shuzhi and published in the name of the CCP Opposition. There were also many kinds of reactionary leaflets distributed in the name of resisting Japan, most of which aimed to overthrow the Kuomintang National Government of the Republic of China and establish a Soviet government, with the ultimate goal of proletarian dictatorship. Wang Wu, Wang Ziping, and He Afang were all veterans in the Communist Party. Those who were expelled from the party for opposing the Stalin faction, along with Pu Yifan and Wang Zhaoqun, were the main members of the organization of the CCP Opposition. Wang Wu and Pu Yifan were recommended as alternate members of the Central Executive Committee, while Wang Ziping and He Afang were responsible for copying and printing to assist in propaganda. Wang Zhaoqun attended meetings every week, and Guo Jinghao joined in the eighteenth year of the Republic of China, serving as a committee member and working on student movements. In October of the 21st year of the Republic of China, the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau received a secret report that a fake central organ of the Communist Party was located on the upper floor of No. 210 Chunyang Lane, Dongyouheng Road, Public Concession. Inspectors Zhang Qingtai and section member Lu Wenhu were immediately dispatched, together with West Detective Gorter of the patrol room, to conduct a search at the address on the 15th of the same month. It happened that Xie Shaoshan, the owner of the house who was also a member of the CCP Opposition, and Pu Yifan, Peng Shuzhi, Wang Wu, Wang Zhaoqun, and other five people were holding a weekly meeting. They were all arrested on the spot, and a large number of reactionary documents were seized. Reactionary documents were also found in the apartment of Pu Yifan, located on the upper floor of No. 322 Gaofu Lane, Rue des Soeurs. Then, it was learned that Chen Duxiu's residence was No. 11 Yongxing Lane, Yuezhou Road, and he was arrested. A large number of reactionary documents were also found in his residence in two searches. Later, according to the location described by Xie Shaoshan, Wang Ziping and He Afang and suspects Liang Youguang and Wang Jiantang were arrested successively. When Wang Ziping and He Afang were arrested, they were printing publications such as "School Life" and "Spark" in their residence at No. 335 Yeguang Lane, Tangshan Road. Guo Jinghao was arrested by the police guarding Wang Ziping's house when he visited Wang Ziping's house. The patrol police then transferred the above-mentioned criminals and evidence to the court through the Public Concession Patrol Room. After the prosecutor's investigation, Chen Duxiu and Peng Shuzhi were suspected of violating Article 2, Paragraph 1, and Article 6 of the Emergency Law for Punishing Those Who Endanger the Republic of China. Wang Ziping and He Afang were suspected of violating Article 6 of the same law and assisting in violating Article 2, Paragraph 2 of the same law. Wang Wu, Pu Yifan, Wang Zhaoqun, Guo Jinghao, Liang Youguang, and Wang Jiantang were suspected of violating Article 6 of the same law, and a public prosecution was initiated.</p>
<p>(Reasoning)</p>
<p>The results of the trial of this case, based on various evidence to separately determine the reasons for the guilt or innocence of the defendants, are explained separately as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the part of Chen Duxiu and Peng Shuzhi: Defendant Chen Duxiu founded the Communist Party in China in the ninth year of the Republic of China, and Peng Shuzhi joined in the tenth year, both appointed by the Second International as members of the Central Standing Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, with Chen Duxiu concurrently serving as secretary. By the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, they were both dismissed from their positions by the Second International, and in the eighteenth year, they were both expelled from the party. Then they gathered comrades and organized the CCP Opposition. The above facts are not only repeatedly and clearly stated by the defendants themselves, but also found in the seized documents, such as "Chen Duxiu and Peng Shuzhi's Letter to All Party Comrades" and "Chen Duxiu and Peng Shuzhi's Letter to the Central Committee," which describe the details of the process in great detail, attacking the Stalin faction with all their might. It can be determined that the defendants have indeed broken away from the Second International. However, after breaking away, whether they organized the CCP Opposition with the aim of endangering the Republic of China, what the degree of endangerment is, and what kind of criminal responsibility they bear, should be based on the defendants' confessions and the seized documents, cross-referenced and viewed as the basis for the judgment. This court has reviewed the seized documents, excluding the books that are only prohibited and not related to the case, and found that there are more than 100 kinds of publications edited by the defendants in the name of the CCP Opposition, such as the small booklets "Spark," "School Life," "The Proletarian," and "The Uprising Tide," and such as "Where is China Going?" "The Meaning of Domestic Unity Against Foreign Aggression," "The Situation After the Second Resolution of the League of Nations," "A Declaration to the People for the Japanese Imperialist Attack on Shanghai," "A Declaration to the People of the Whole Country for the Japanese Occupation of Shanghai," "A Declaration to Workers for the May 1st Labor Day," "Organizing Committee Circulars," and various leaflets. The content of these documents mostly attacked the Kuomintang government as being organized by the bourgeoisie and used by imperialists, advocating that workers and poor peasants rise up for class struggle, and denouncing the Three Principles of the People as reactionary doctrines. They also stated that the nation-building program of military rule and tutelage should be resolutely torn to shreds, and taking advantage of Japan's invasion, they falsely accused the government of non-resistance, using the name of anti-Japanese national salvation to overthrow the Kuomintang National Government of the Republic of China, and organize a Soviet government, with the ultimate goal of proletarian dictatorship. The most obvious of the reactionary texts is the political resolution issued in the name of the Central Standing Committee of the CCP Opposition, which states, "Our tasks are (1) to organize and participate in the militia movement of workers, peasants, and urban poor in various places, resolutely raise the banner of anti-Japanese and anti-Kuomintang, and to carry out disintegration movements in the regular army to break away from the control of the Kuomintang and establish an anti-Japanese and anti-Kuomintang militia; (2) to use all our strength to promote the defensive and even offensive struggles of urban workers, to make the strike movement widespread, and to organize workers' soviets. If there are militias in the area, or armies that we can influence, then we will further establish soviets; (3) to develop a broad armed struggle of peasants under the banner of seizing land, anti-imperialism, and anti-Kuomintang, and to expand peasant soviets; (4) Once peasant soviets in the provinces, urban soviets, or militias are established, they will merge with the Soviet Red Army to occupy cities," etc. (omitted below) (see "School Life," Issue 4). This is consistent with Chen Duxiu and Peng Shuzhi's confession to this court, "Our CCP Opposition has different political views from the Stalin faction. The ultimate goal is of course to overthrow the Kuomintang National Government and build a Soviet government with proletarian dictatorship." The Republic of China is a democratic country whose sovereignty is vested in all the people. All citizens of the Republic of China, regardless of gender, race, religion, or class, are legally equal (see Article 6 of the Provisional Constitution). In a Soviet country, however, sovereignty is only vested in the worker-peasant class, and people outside this special class have no political rights. These two systems are obviously different kinds of national systems. Moreover, the Republic of China is building the National Government, based on the Three Principles of the People and a sovereign constitution, and the Kuomintang is guiding the people in the process of revolutionary construction during the period of tutelage. Therefore, the Three Principles of the People are the foundation of the construction of the Republic of China, and the Kuomintang National Government are leading agencies engaged in construction. The CCP Opposition organized by the defendants took the overthrow of the Three Principles of the People and the implementation of communism as its primary objective, and its ultimate goal was to overthrow the Kuomintang National Government, organize a Soviet, and implement a proletarian dictatorship. This is not only an attempt to change the national system of the Republic of China, which is governed by the whole people, but also to fundamentally overthrow the construction of the Republic of China. There is no doubt that they are endangering the Republic of China and committing treason. Although the defendants have repeatedly confessed during the investigation and trial in this court, "Our CCP Opposition group has only hundreds of people in total, distributed in Tianjin, Shanghai, Hong Kong, and other places. Because our strength is small, we cannot have military organizations, so we do not yet have a Red Army. We advocate that the Red Army should be organized by pure workers and peasants, and should not be mixed with bandits. And a Red Army is only needed after the establishment of a Soviet. We have different political views from the Communists in Jiangxi and Hubei provinces, so there is no possibility of cooperation," etc. This court also reviewed the seized documents, such as the CCP Opposition's "The Proletarian" publication. In its second issue, edited by Chen Duxiu, regarding the so-called Red Army issue, it stated, "The communist parties of dozens of countries around the world have always adhered to Engels's legacy and dare not adopt a policy of using vagrant proletarians (referring to bandits and defeated soldiers). Now the traitors of the Chinese workers' movement, Li Lisan, Xiang Zhongfa, Zhou Enlai, etc. (all Stalinist factions of the Third International), are using this kind of vagrant proletarians as their guards and pillars, simply treating them as the main force of the proletarian revolutionary movement, trying to expand it, and relying on the so-called Red Army based on the vagrant proletarians to lead the peasants in guerrilla warfare. Except for being defeated or collected by the ruling class, or disintegrating internally, or gradually compromising with the rural bourgeoisie and turning into their White Army, there can be no other future." Also, in Peng Shuzhi's article "Stalinists' Assessment of the Manchurian Incident and the Crisis of the Anti-Japanese Movement" in the fourth issue of the first volume of "Spark," it stated, "The Stalinists only trust the Red Army, thinking that with the Red Army, they can take over the world. The armed struggle of peasants in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi is a fact, but they have neglected the urban workers' movement and placed all their illusions on these armed peasants. This is the main reason why they have been in a dead end for several years," etc. From this, it can be seen that the defendants opposed the Stalin faction's adoption of the Red Army strategy and the use of bandits and defeated soldiers to lead rural peasants in armed uprisings under the current situation in China. Therefore, the defendants have no connection with the armed bandits in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces. As a result, the CCP Opposition has not yet launched an uprising. This can also prove it. However, the pamphlets and leaflets listed above are all texts used by the CCP Opposition for propaganda. These texts have been successively published, and the purpose and goal of the propaganda are all to endanger the Republic of China and commit treason, as detailed in the previous section. Even if the defendants have not reached the point of implementing disturbances, they are not only organizing groups with the aim of endangering the Republic of China, but also using writing to promote treason. According to the legislative spirit of Article 2 of the Emergency Law for Punishing Those Who Endanger the Republic of China, in addition to constituting the crime of Article 6 of the same law, they should also constitute the crime of that article. As for the defendants' defense, saying that implementing communism is beneficial and harmless to the Republic of China, and plotting to overthrow the Kuomintang National Government should not be considered treason, etc., this kind of claim is completely contrary to the current laws of the Republic of China (see the reasons above). Moreover, the defendants plotted to overthrow the National Government and then organize a Soviet government with proletarian dictatorship, which is even more intolerable to the national system of our country for thousands of years, and there is no room for adoption. It is even less of a reason to excuse them from criminal responsibility. However, considering that the defendants are all thinkers who have worked hard and thought deeply, the reason for their crimes is due to studying socialism and misleading others, and they have no selfish thoughts, and they criticize the Stalin faction for using bandits and defeated soldiers to lead rural peasants in armed uprisings. Judging from the evidence, the opposition faction has not yet prepared to implement an uprising. After reviewing the circumstances, they can still be treated leniently, and should be given a reduced sentence to show fairness. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Joint Defense Conference of County Magistrates of Three Counties</h3>
<p>The areas of Taicang, Jiading, and Baoshan counties are remote and close to the coast. Therefore, not only do pirates land from time to time to rob and kidnap, but also bandits in the interior appear and disappear unpredictably. The county magistrates, etc., in view of this, specially convened a joint defense conference of the administrative heads of the counties at the Jiading County Government today to prevent future troubles. The time is 10:00 AM today. It is said that invitations were issued yesterday to gather at No. 70 Yuyuan Lane, Yuyuan Road, Shanghai, and then take a car to Jiading.</p>

He is 27 years old and currently works for a company in the Shanghai Continental Department Store. Xiaocang returned to Changshu the other day because his father was suffering from blood disease. On the 21st, he and his sister Yin Yi took the Qingyanggang scheduled boat to Shanghai. When the boat passed near Tangshi Bacheng, he fell into the river after missing his footing while viewing the scenery on the deck. His sister screamed for help when she saw this. By the time the boat stopped for rescue, he had sunk to the bottom of the river and could not be rescued. Yin Yi landed on the shore and sent a special messenger to Changshu to report to the family. Her cousin Yu Shugao took a steamboat to retrieve the body. As of the morning of the 22nd, there was still no news.</p>
<h3>Provincial Chamber of Commerce Federation Meets in Changshu</h3>

<h3>Military Police Arrest Two Bandits</h3>
<p>At 11:00 AM on the 19th, when the third and fourth class train departing from Zhenjiang arrived at Zhaze Station, two bandits dressed in military uniforms and wearing symbols, each with a handgun, walked to Zhaze Station from the west road. It happened to be raining heavily, and the two took refuge in the station platform flag switch room. The military police stationed at the station caught a glimpse of them and went forward to question them. At first, they claimed to be active-duty soldiers, but it was immediately noticed that the names and symbols they reported did not match. A row of handgun bullets was found on their bodies. Seeing that the situation was not good, the bandits tried to resist with their guns. At that time, four more military police came forward and quickly snatched their handguns and arrested them at the station. They were interrogated by Squad Leader Zhou and confessed that their surnames were all Liu, and there were four other accomplices who planned to take a train to Suzhou to commit illegal activities. Squad Leader Zhou, according to the confession, sent the two bandits to the Zhenjiang Station Military Police Company for transfer to the Wuxi Military Police Corps for handling.</p>
<h3>The Department of Finance Reforms Long-Standing Malpractices of Grain Bureaus</h3>
<p>The Department of Finance believes that the long-standing malpractices of grain bureaus in various counties are extremely deep and have been repeatedly reported by the people. It is difficult to completely eradicate them without severe measures, and there is no hope for improvement in land tax. Now that the finance bureaus of various counties have been abolished, and the power of the county magistrates is unified, they should be able to effectively take responsibility for the malpractices of land tax. Yesterday, a special order was sent to the counties to thoroughly investigate the embezzlement and corruption of the clerks and tax collectors, and to formulate practical reform methods, which must be reported to the department within five days of the receipt of the document for consideration and adoption of thorough measures, in order to implement reforms throughout the province.</p>

<h3>Silk Season in Four Rural Townships Is Very Good</h3>
<p>The silk season in the four rural townships this year is still good. Although there have been continuous overcast and rainy days recently, it does not matter. In the 5th District, the Guantou, Xiachengtang, Dalishi, Nanfanghe, Nanhetou, Xicun, and Zhangcun areas, the large gangs have already started up after a major sleep, and the quality is very good. Leaf prices are one yuan and two or three jiao per dan. In Yanjiaqiao, Yangjian, and other places, the large gangs have started up after the third sleep. In Yuqi, Lishe, Luoshe, Fangqiao, and other places, the large gangs have only started up after the second sleep. Leaf prices are also the same as in the 5th District. If there are no special changes in the weather in the future, a bumper harvest is guaranteed.</p>
<h3>Rural Laborers Reduce Wages</h3>
<p>The national crisis is not over, business is sluggish, and the rural economy has declared bankruptcy. The strong take risks, and the weak fall into ditches and ravines. The provincial government is trying its best to remedy the situation. It had previously ordered the counties to consider the local situation, briefly state their opinions, and report back to the province for selection. County Magistrate Yan of this county has reported the experience gained to the provincial government after receiving the order. However, at this time, the grain is cheap and hurts farmers, and the situation in the countryside is unspeakable. Taking this county as an example, silkworm affairs have failed for years, and small food farmers are struggling to make a living. The situation is very tragic. In addition, the various rural laborers are unattended. The only remedy is to find ways to reduce wages in order to survive. Now, in Fuzhou Township and Ganke Township in the 15th District, the daily wages of mud workers, carpenters, tailors, and farmers will be reduced to 80% from next month. The troupe was hired a few days ago to perform Peking opera for two days at the Fuzhou Village Land Temple to inform everyone and show uniformity.</p>

<h3>Major Flooding Disaster at Suixi Estuary</h3>
<p>The Suixi Estuary is located in the Eighth District of Suxian County, a remote area on the Anhui border,</p>
<p>bordering Jiangsu and Henan provinces. The Suixi and Er Rivers are its main waterways. Since the construction of a dam at the Lieshan Coal Mine in the seventh year of the Republic [1918], water flow has been obstructed, causing immeasurable damage every year. Furthermore, over the past decade or so, the upstream Gang, Xiao, Yang, Pei, and Longdai, Mao, Jiang, and Hong Rivers in Yongxia have all been breached, flowing into the Suixi River. The small Suixi River has become the convergence point for numerous streams, but the blockage of the dam remains, and the riverbed remains silted up. There have been constant concerns of flooding and disasters. Unexpectedly, Heaven did not show mercy. On the night of May 11th, torrential rain fell, continuing for ten days without stopping. Floodwaters overflowed, turning both banks into a vast expanse of water. The green fields were submerged. In a region already suffering from twenty years of famine and decline, the wheat crop was devastated by the flood. There is no hope for even a small harvest in the autumn. Hundreds of thousands of disaster-stricken people are left with barely any survivors.</p>

<h3>Illegally Manufacturing Firearms, Arrested and Sent to the County</h3>
<p>The police squad leader of this county, Wen Yanling, was previously ordered to go to the</p>
<p>northeastern villages to suppress bandits. While passing through the Sunjia Weir area, on the border of Gaobao in the Tenth District, he received a report from local villagers that there was an illegal firearms manufacturing operation in the area, selling weapons to unscrupulous individuals. Squad Leader Wen immediately conducted a search at the address provided and arrested the gunsmiths Zhu Yutian and Yao Changlin. They were sent to the county government yesterday for interrogation.</p>

<h3>Unemployed Traveler Commits Suicide by Drowning</h3>
<p>On the afternoon of the 20th, at the Jianggan Yidu Ferry, there was a traveler from</p>

<p>The Central News Agency reports that Soviet Ambassador Bogomolov has concluded his series of meetings with Chinese foreign affairs authorities in Beijing, which covered all important matters between China and Russia.

The stations along the way include Shanghai, Ningbo, Wenzhou, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Shantou, and Hong Kong. All the above stations are seaplane bases, so seaplanes will be used for the flights. Traveling from Shanghai to Guangdong by boat takes three days, but after the Shanghai-Guangdong route opens, it will only take one day.</p>
<p>Yichang-Chengdu Section</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Chengdu route is one of the company's three major routes. In the past, due to financial difficulties and other reasons, the route was divided into three sections: Shanghai-Hankou, Hankou-Yichang, and Yichang-Chengdu, which were opened gradually. The Shanghai-Hankou and Hankou-Yichang routes have already been officially opened, and the business is quite prosperous. To complete this route, a trial flight on the Yichang-Chengdu section is scheduled for June 1.

<p>The Haiying patrol ship ran aground off the coast of Putuo Mountain on the morning of the 19th while sailing from Shenjiamen to Shanghai for repairs. All 32 officers, soldiers, and sailors, as well as weapons, were rescued by fishing boats. At 10 AM yesterday, the Cihang ship of the Lianxing Company of Shenjiamen sailed past the grounding site and immediately took measures to tow it to safety. It has safely arrived in Dinghai, with only damage to the ship's axle, costing approximately 1,000 yuan.</p>

<p>After the Fuhai patrol ship sank, the old engineer Xin Yurun fled out of fear of punishment. The first and second mates were detained by the Bureau's office in Shenjiamen, and the office sent Tian Xin on the 21st to escort the first and second mates by boat to Shanghai. After arriving in Shanghai, they will report the details of the sinking of the Fuhai and the escape of the Haiying to the patrol commissioner Wang Zhiliang and the Director Chen Zhongsheng, and request instructions on the salvage of the Fuhai and the repair of the Haiying.</p>
<p>Aftermath</p>
<p>The New Sound News reporter met yesterday morning with Director Chen Zhongsheng and Patrol Commissioner Wang Zhiliang of the Bureau. They said that the grounding and sinking of the Fuhai patrol ship was unexpected and was due to the carelessness of the crew. It has now been decided to request a salvage company to send personnel to salvage the ship. After it is salvaged, the extent of the damage will be assessed before proceeding with dock repairs. As for the Haiying patrol ship, which was originally intended for repairs, it is fortunate to have escaped and is now docked in Dinghai.

<h3>Funeral of U.S. Marine Corps Commander Col. Gulick Held Yesterday</h3>
<p>Sails Home Today</p>
<p>After Colonel Gilgul, Commander of the U.S. Marine Corps in Shanghai, passed away in Shanghai last Tuesday, his funeral was held at the Trinity Church on Sanma Road at 2 PM yesterday. He will be transported back to his hometown on Long Island, New York, for burial.

<h3>Shanghai Telephone Bureau's Price Increase Situation</h3>
<p>Prices are Cheaper Compared to Other Places, and Have Gained Public Understanding for Payment</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications announced the increase in telephone rates, various industry associations have opposed it, and the noise has been overwhelming. According to the person in charge of the Bureau yesterday, after the installation of automatic telephones, the Ministry of Communications revised the business prices. Considering the depressed market in Shanghai since January 28th, after several deliberations, in order to reduce the burden on the citizens, the prices were specially reduced compared to the automatic telephones of the Shanghai Telephone Company and Nanjing, showing consideration for the difficulties of merchants. It is difficult to further reduce them. Moreover, communication in the Chinese concession still depends on the switchboard operator, and the number of employees laid off is actually small. The Bureau is currently planning and actively improving the telephone service to ensure rapid communication and meet the expectations of the public. Among the various industry associations, the majority have paid the fees according to the new regulations this month. Judging from the current situation, it has gained the understanding of the majority of citizens and should not be insisted on. If there are a few users who fail to pay the monthly rent by the deadline, the Bureau will have no choice but to follow the regulations.</p>

<h3>The New Currency Review Committee Will Be Established After the New Model is Cast</h3>
<p>The Already Cast Coins Will Not Be Circulated in the Future</p>
<p>After the Central Mint opens the casting of new coins, the Ministry of Finance will form a new currency review committee and hire leaders of Chinese and foreign silver and money industries as members. It is said that it will be established on June 1. American technicians and new models will arrive in Shanghai within a few days. The details are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<h3>Review Committee</h3>
<p>According to the news from the Secretariat of the Central Bank yesterday,</p>
<p>The date of establishment of the new review committee must wait for the arrival of the new model of the coin factory in Shanghai before it can be implemented.

New models and American technicians will arrive in Shanghai immediately. In the future, after the new model coins are cast, whether the already cast coins will be circulated in the market, the Central Mint claims that it depends on the order of the Ministry of Finance. However, the Central Bank claims that the new coins currently cast are marked as the 21st year of the Republic, although they meet the color and weight regulations of the Ministry of Finance, but the announcement of the Currency Regulations is the 22nd year of the Republic, so they cannot be circulated in the market. After the new model coins are cast, they will be submitted for review and circulation in the market.</p>
<h3>The Railway Reduced the Freight Rates of Two Kinds of Goods, Silkworms</h3>
<p>My country's silk industry is in decline and exports have been sharply reduced. In order to maintain domestic production, the Ministry of Railways previously reduced the freight rates for raw silk and silkworm cocoons to the second-class rate. Now, silkworm cocoons are even more the raw material for silk reeling, and their value is even lower than that of raw silk. Yesterday, it has ordered all roads to change from the second class to the third class to collect freight in order to reward and benefit transportation. It is heard that the Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration has received this instruction and ordered it to comply.</p>
<h3>Pigs</h3>
<p>In order to take care of the merchants and increase freight traffic, the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways previously requested the Ministry of Railways to approve the reduction of the freight rate for pigs on the two lines by 25% according to the original price. Now it has received instructions to approve a trial period of six months.

<h3>Wang Xiaolai's Reply to Mu Ouchu Regarding Aviation to Save the Nation Awards</h3>
<p>Concerning Aviation to Save the Nation Awards</p>
<p>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Chairman Wang Xiaolai, yesterday, regarding the Aviation to Save the Nation Awards, replied to Mu Ouchu in a letter, saying, "Ouchu, my esteemed friend, I have returned to Shanghai from Beijing and received your kind letter, containing instructions regarding the Aviation to Save the Nation Awards. I am grateful for your guidance, both personally and for the public good. However, the letter had the words 'strictly confidential' on the envelope, yet the entire letter was disclosed in the newspaper. As the matter concerns the public, it is appropriate for public discussion. Moreover, I, Xiaolai, advocate openness in all matters and have nothing to hide in my words or deeds. My only concern is that someone's warm-hearted enthusiasm for mutual assistance might be diminished by misunderstandings, which would have a significant impact. The Aviation to Save the Nation Awards were initiated by colleagues in the Aviation Association's Recruitment Team. I merely supported it because I found their intentions commendable. All the methods were preliminary drafts, not proposals I made, and they still require formal approval from the initiators. At the initial tea party, I was only one of the hosts. Furthermore, I only expressed appreciation for antique artifacts at the party, and unfortunately, my speech was not fully recorded. The appropriateness of the matter and how to proceed will all be determined by the individuals who agree to sign as initiators. The valuation of real estate and antiques requires not only public appraisal, but also, in my opinion, should be first publicly advertised for sale to determine their fair value before final confirmation. I will certainly not arbitrarily give them to others under the guise of a good reputation for personal gain. I am always happy to help others succeed. After September 18th, calls for action filled the nation, but how many people truly love their country? You, sir, also served as the Director of the General Affairs Group of the Northeast Refugee Relief Association. What were the results of several months of hard work? Aside from monthly donations from various industries, the so-called wealthy individuals still leisurely reside in garden villas, fondling their antique treasures, unwilling to part with even a single hair. Westerners have already excelled at the good deed of providing some donations. Thinking of this, how can we not feel ashamed? My abilities may be limited, but I am confident in my honest opinions and steadfast integrity. Who is without a reputation? I am but a stubborn fool, simply seeking to serve others. I return the title of 'celebrity' to you. I reply frankly, and those who love me will understand. With best wishes for your well-being, Wang Xiaolai respectfully replies."</p>

<h3>Seamen's Branch Refuses to Accept Representatives Recommended Yesterday to Petition the City Government</h3>

They convened a meeting to discuss how to respond and immediately nominated Zhou Xiaoting, Wei Xiecheng, Lang Hairong, and Cheng Ting as representatives to petition the City Government at Fenglin Bridge at 10:30 AM yesterday. Yu, an official from the Second Section of the City Government, received them. Zhou Xiaoting submitted a written statement detailing the incident and requesting suppression. Yu stated that he would report to the mayor and then instruct the City Public Security Bureau to go to the Old School Field at 2:00 PM that afternoon to suppress the situation and prevent any conflict between the two sides. The representatives then left and went to the City Public Security Bureau to petition, it is reported.</p>
<p>New Voice News Agency: Huang Gongyi and Li Xuan of the Middle Cabin Guild jointly telegraphed the Central Guidance Committee for People's Movement in Nanjing, saying, "We respectfully note that the date of implementation of the Seamen's Union Organization Regulations has not yet been announced. However, the existing Special Seamen's Party Department is arbitrarily disrupting the trade union organization system and recklessly reorganizing the Shanghai Seamen's Branch. We request the immediate establishment of the Seamen's General Union and a telegram ordering the department to cease its illegal actions in order to prioritize the labor movement and avoid disputes. The Shanghai Liyi Xuan Middle Cabin Guild, Huang Gongyi, and other seamen's organizations kowtow."</p>
<h3>Workers at Da Zhong Rubber Factory Begin Hunger Strike Yesterday Morning and Resume Eating Last Night; Formal Mediation Scheduled for Today</h3>
<p>Workers at the Da Zhong Rubber Factory on Singapore Road in West Shanghai recently went on strike because the factory opposed workers organizing a union. The workers repeatedly appealed to resume work and maintain meals, but their requests were not granted. With their livelihoods cut off, the workers organized a Forced Workers Appeals Committee to negotiate, but without any substantial results. More than eighty of these workers declared a hunger strike starting at 7:00 AM yesterday and issued a declaration,</p>
<p>Reporting to Higher Authorities</p>
<p>The Rubber Industry Workers Union of the Third District sent representative Zhou Huihua to the City General Labor Union to report and request immediate dispatch of personnel</p>
<p>to persuade the workers to eat and provide effective assistance. Upon receiving the report, the General Labor Union immediately dispatched cadre Yu Yaoqiu to the factory,</p>
<p>first to comfort the workers. However, as there were no responsible personnel from the factory, there was no way to negotiate. He then notified the City Party Headquarters by telephone, requesting assistance in dispatching personnel to handle the matter. At the same time, the Red Cross learned of the situation and ordered an ambulance to the scene, but the workers still refused to eat anything.</p>
<p>Party and Government Mediation</p>
<p>Upon receiving the report from the General Labor Union, the City Party Headquarters, through Zhou Funong, Director of the People's Movement Section, notified the Social Affairs Bureau to discuss solutions and dispatched Dai Yongzhan, along with Wang Xianqing, Mediation Director of the Third Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, and Yu Yaoqiu, cadre of the General Labor Union, to the factory's distribution office on Gongguan Road in the French Concession to meet with Manager Chen Zhongyan. They ordered him to first find a way to maintain the workers' meals and then prepare to resume work. Chen agreed to first allocate 100 yuan as relief. The party and government representatives then rushed to the factory to persuade the workers, handing over the factory's relief fund of 100 yuan to the union representative to claim. They also promised to formally convene mediation this afternoon. The workers believed that the case had a chance of being resolved, so they resumed eating last night.</p>

<h3>Yongfeng Guild and Others Write to Ningbo Fish Merchants Requesting They Deduct Construction Fees as in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Since the Fisheries Construction Fee Collection Office of the Fisheries Improvement Committee of the Ministry of Industry in the Jiangsu-Zhejiang region began collecting fees on April 15th, the Jiang-Zhe eight gangs of Shanghai merchants have all complied. For more than a month now, they have been able to coexist peacefully. However, a few fish firms in Ningbo misunderstood the purpose of the construction fee, leading to opposition. Recently, the Yongfeng Guild and other Jiang-Zhe eight gangs of fish merchants jointly stamped and sent a letter to the fish firms in Ningbo, instructing them to deduct and remit the fees separately in accordance with the Shanghai method. The original letter from the eight gangs of fish merchants to the Ningbo firms is recorded below: To Whom It May Concern: The Fisheries Improvement Committee of the Ministry of Industry in the Jiangsu-Zhejiang region is collecting a construction fee of 1% of the value of goods. In Shanghai, the fish firms have been deducting and remitting the fees separately from the prices of goods and passengers for nearly a month, and they have been able to coexist peacefully. The fish merchants of Shanghai and Ningbo are essentially one entity. We have already sent a letter to your trade association regarding the construction fees to be paid in Ningbo, informing the fish firms to deduct and remit the fees separately in accordance with the Shanghai method in order to achieve uniformity. As for the protection of the ocean, our guilds are currently consulting with the management bureau and have a comprehensive plan. We will dispatch warships to patrol outside the port at any time for each fresh ship entering from Ningbo to ensure the safety of passengers. This letter is sent urgently, hoping that you will take it into consideration.</p>

Judson near the Guanghua Petroleum Depot in Gaoqiao. Details were reported in this newspaper for the past two days. A reporter visited the Hetai Company yesterday to inquire about the negotiations. According to the company, negotiations are ongoing. They sent a letter to the Dafeng Company last Saturday, but have not yet received a reply, which has stalled progress. Therefore, they are currently handling customs procedures. As for the issue of responsibility, they hope that the other party has diagrams of the incident at the time. However, the goods and passengers have all taken out insurance on their own. It is reported that the various insurance companies underwriting the policies held a meeting today (i.e., yesterday) and plan to go to the scene of the accident today to inspect it and then find ways to salvage the goods first.</p>
<h3>Yongxing Ship Being Salvaged</h3>
<p>Insurance Company Takes Over Negotiations; China Salvage Company to Undertake</p>
<p>The Ningshao Company's Yongxing ship, which was coming to Shanghai from Fuzhou on the 1st of this month, encountered fog and ran aground on a reef near Mopan Mountain in Haimen. This was reported in previous newspapers. Recently, the ship's accountant, Zhu Shisheng, who was kidnapped by bandits, sent a letter to his family in Shanghai, demanding a ransom of 500 yuan. After receiving the letter, his family went to Haimen to negotiate. The outcome is currently unknown. The Yongxing ship, which sank, has been advertised by the company for demolition and sale. It is now known that the insurance company has come forward and reached an agreement with the China Salvage Company at No. 28 Yanqing Lane, Xiamen Road, on the salvage procedure fee. There are two methods: (1) If the hull is salvaged, the insurance company will take only 30% of the appraised value.

<h3>Singaporean Overseas Chinese Plan to Establish a Coffee Factory in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Central News Agency: In recent years, Chinese people have often used coffee as a beverage, so the amount of coffee imported from foreign countries each year is quite large. According to customs trade reports, coffee imports in the 19th year of the Republic reached 544,462 catties, worth 266,413 taels of silver. In the 20th year, it was 499,374 catties, worth 70,495 taels of silver. The most imports came from the Dutch East Indies, followed by Singapore and Honolulu. Overseas Chinese Lin Luru, in order to reclaim profit rights, plans to raise funds to establish a coffee factory in Shanghai, purchase coffee produced by overseas Chinese in the British and Dutch territories in Southeast Asia, and process it into high-quality powder for Chinese people to drink, thereby developing overseas Chinese industry. He has specifically requested the Guidance Division of the International Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Industry to investigate the annual coffee import quantity and price in Shanghai for reference. There are no such factories in China. It is a very good phenomenon for overseas Chinese to return to China to invest and develop Chinese industry.</p>

<h3>Sauce and Liquor Industry Association Initiates Rectification of Retail Prices</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Sauce and Liquor Industry Association held a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees yesterday, chaired by Chen Xikang, to discuss the rectification of retail prices. It was generally believed that business was declining and foreign prices were rising sharply, while members of the industry only knew how to compete, regardless of sacrifice. If this continues, they will all go bankrupt in the future. If they do not rise up and save themselves, how will they maintain their future? Therefore, the rectification of market prices is indeed an urgent matter. Looking at various industries in Shanghai, they all have organizations with uniform industry prices. Why is the sauce and liquor industry any different? Moreover, since the industry rules have already been announced, they can be followed. Therefore, it was resolved to start rectification and assess prices within one week. First, industry price lists will be printed and distributed, and investigations will begin on June 1st to correct chaos and move towards consistency. It is reported that the inspection department has been fully organized, with Han Xingwei appointed as the director of the department and Shen Jiabin and Weng Weifu hired as deputy directors.</p>

Unexpectedly, at around 10:00 AM this morning, Wythepong suddenly used a razor blade to cut his throat and commit suicide. Although the prison guards discovered him and immediately provided medical treatment, the injuries were very serious, and it is reported that he is not yet out of danger.</p>

<h3>Xin'an Hotel Catches Six Robbers Who Confess to Their Crimes</h3>
<p>The other day, the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau Detective Team's detective, You Hanwen,</p>
<p>received a tip-off, reporting that a large number of bandits were hiding in the Caojiadu area of ​​western Shanghai.</p>
<p>He immediately reported to the team leader, who dispatched foreman Chen Caifu, Wu Kezhong, and detectives Wu Tianxiang, Wu Songshan, Wei Feng, You Hanwen, Yang Zhongjin, and others to Xin'an Hotel in Xin Kang Li, Jisifei Road, Caojiadu. At the time, bandits Wang Yulin, Zhang Jipin, Guan Hesheng, Chen Xiaobao, and others were hiding in room number 7 of the hotel. They were loading bullets into their gun chambers, hiding them on their bodies, preparing to go to a certain surname's house on Tongfu Road to commit robbery. Foreman Chen and the others kicked open the door of room number 7. When the bandit Zhang Jipin caught sight of the detectives arriving, he knew things were bad. He immediately rushed to the bedside, intending to seize the pistol hidden under the pillow on the bed in order to shoot and resist arrest. Chen bravely jumped forward, subdued him, and arrested Wang Yulin and the others. Along with them, three pistols were found. The hotel tea room attendant, Shen Jigang, was also taken into custody. Subsequently, they proceeded to No. 14 Yifeng Li, Jisifei Road, and No. 15 Zhuangjiahang, Zhongshan Road, Zhabei, and apprehended six more bandits: Qian Sifa (aka Wu Xiangong), Liu Xitang, Wang Ruisheng, Wang Azhang, Zhu Agou, and Zhu Zhangshi. After being taken into custody, Zhang Jipin confessed during the preliminary trial by the team leader that he was 28 years old, from Ningbo, and lived at No. 58 Xin Kang Li. Two weeks ago, he and Jiang Jiang Xiaolan, Guan Hesheng, and others used pistols to rob a certain surname's house in Erwan Li of the Zhabei Gongyi small vegetable market. The stolen money was divided and spent. The pistols used for each robbery were supplied by Wu Xiangong, who then took his share of the loot on the spot. Qian Genfa confessed that he was 38 years old, from Changshu, and lived at No. 10 Yi Li. He frankly admitted to supplying pistols to Zhang and others and taking his share of the loot on the spot. He also confessed that the diamond ring found on him by the detectives when he was arrested was sent to him by a friend, a monk. Wang Yulin confessed that he was 42 years old, from Qingjiang, and lived with his elder sister at No. 6 Guangyu Li, next to the Tilanqiao Prison in Hongkou. He also confessed to participating in robberies with Zhang and others. He claimed that he had been arrested for trafficking people and sentenced to six years in prison, and had only been released last month. Guan Hesheng confessed that he was 28 years old, from Wuxi, and had just come to Shanghai from his hometown and was lodging at Chen Xiaomai's house. It had only been three days since he arrived. Today, a person nicknamed "Quezui Acai" (Missing Tooth Acai) came to call for him and Chen to go to Xin'an Hotel, but he did not know what it was about and had not participated in Zhang and others' armed robberies. Shen Jigang confessed that he was 36 years old, from Qingpu, and knew nothing about Zhang and others' activities. Wang Ruisheng and Wang Azhang both denied involvement in the robbery case. However, Liu Xitang confessed that he was 32 years old, from Henan, and frankly admitted to participating in robberies with Zhang and others. Zhu Agou confessed that he was 28 years old, from Wuxi, and had been introduced to Liu Kuntang by Wu Xiangong to lodge at his house. Because they were old friends, he could not refuse, so he agreed, but he did not know that these people were robbers. Zhu Zhangshi confessed that she was 32 years old, that Agou was her husband, and the rest of her statement was the same as Zhu's. Chen Xiaobao confessed that he was 29 years old, from Wuxi, and had been running the Laodetai Hotel in the Sanjiaochang area. Because Zhang and others owed a lot of money for wine, he went to Xin'an Hotel to collect the debt, resulting in his mistaken arrest. As the matter concerned a robbery case, he was ordered to prepare a document and send it to the bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Extortion Gang Also Found to Have Committed Two Other Cases</h3>
<p>Zhu Panquan, a Suzhou native residing at No. 2, Lane 201, Tongfu Road, is in the gold business. Since last year, he has successively received threatening letters from a bandit named Huang Hua, seeking to extort 1,000 yuan. They also agreed to meet at Daokou Lane in Ximen on the night of the 11th of this month to discuss the payment. Zhu reported the letter to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, which dispatched Chief Detective Fan Defu, Detective Jin Yangwu, and others in disguise to wait at the address together with agents from the Public Security Bureau. They arrested the bandits Qian Hongsheng and Xu Haokun on the spot and took them back to the police station, sending them to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, the trial was scheduled to continue. The police station's lawyer, Li Zhishan, stated the case, saying that during the adjournment period, the police station found that the defendant Qian Hongsheng had also committed two cases of writing threatening letters to Xu Jinmei, a resident of No. 345 Qipu Road, seeking to extort 2,000 yuan, and to Xu Xinsheng, resident of No. 409 Beipu Road, seeking to extort 5,000 yuan. Because the victims had not arrived today, he requested a postponement. The defendant Xu Haokun hired a lawyer to appear in court and requested bail. Judge Wu Tingqi verified the confession and ordered the defendant Xu Haokun to pay a shop guarantee of 1,000 yuan. Hongsheng was returned to custody, and the trial was postponed for seven days.</p>
<h3>Unrequited Love Leads to Forcible Marriage Proposal, Mr. Sang Shameless; Xu Shen Cries Out to the Police in Anger</h3>
<p>Xu Shen, an old woman from Haimen, is 42 years old and lives at No. 1 Maluqiao outside Dananmen in the Nanshi area. She has two daughters, the elder named Lindi, who is 21 years old and has been betrothed to a certain surname's son in Pudong through a matchmaker. The wedding is scheduled to take place this winter. The younger daughter, Youdi, is 14 years old. The mother and daughters work as female laborers in the Zhenxing Weaving Factory on Huining Road, leaving early and returning late every day, as is their custom. Qian Sangsheng, a local gangster from Changzhou, has been observing Lindi's beautiful appearance. Every morning or evening, during the weaving factory's working hours, he and his companions would wait by the roadside, making flirtatious remarks and trying to seduce Lindi. However, because Qian's behavior was improper, Lindi ignored him. However, Qian, consumed by unrequited love, forced Lindi into a small hotel on the 15th of this month, threatening her, saying, "Now I want to marry you. If you don't agree, I will shoot you to death with a pistol." After saying this, he waved her away. Lindi was shocked and immediately returned home, reporting the situation to her mother, who took precautions. The next day, Qian and many companions hired a car and went to the weaving factory, intending to snatch Lindi away and force her to marry him. Fortunately, Lindi found out and quickly hid. After the old woman negotiated with Qian, he still refused to give up, leading to a conflict. The factory foreman, Yuan Zhenqing, stepped forward to mediate, and the matter was settled. Afterward, the old woman, finding Qian's persistent harassment extremely hateful, prepared a document and reported it to the Second Precinct of the First District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, requesting a thorough investigation. Yesterday afternoon at 5 o'clock, the old woman and Lindi were walking in the Xiaonanmen area when they met Qian again. The old woman grabbed him and handed him over to Du Xinhou, a guard on duty at the 30th post there. They were taken to the Third Precinct of the First District, where they were preliminarily interrogated by Section Chief Jin, who ordered them to prepare a document and send it to the bureau for interrogation.</p>

<h3>Bleeding for Bread</h3>
<p>A Terrible Fight Between Two Groups of Workers: One Person Dies in the Courthouse Waiting Room, Many More Injured and Sent to the Hospital</p>
<p>Regarding the case of the fight between Shandong and Hubei workers at the Blue Funnel Wharf in Pudong the other day, it is now known that the Shandong gang leader was originally Wang Anguo. Yang Zaimo and other Hubei workers were recruited by Wang Anguo and had been working together for a long time. However, recently, Shandong has been suffering from famine, and the number of refugees coming to Shanghai has been increasing daily. Wang felt a strong sense of hometown affinity and expanded the number of fellow villagers while gradually excluding the Hubei workers. This led to a major dispute over the bread issue. The Hubei workers were naturally unwilling to leave, as it would mean going hungry. As a result, a decisive battle broke out. The Shandong gang went to gather coal-carrying workers from other places, armed with knives, axes, guns, shovels, etc., to drive out the other gang at the wharf. The Hubei gang also resisted with sticks. A fierce scene ensued. As a result of the battle, Qiu Qingyu, 31, of the Hubei gang, had his head split open. Yan Anguo's eyeball was gouged out with a gun tip. Liu Songkai's lower jaw was removed with a knife and shovel. Wei Heqi's forehead was scraped off with a shovel. Yu Caiquan, Zhang Youfu, Peng Lianggou, and others were wounded in the head, and Qiu Kuncai was wounded in the neck. Zhu Shusheng, Zhu Zuomin, and others of the Shandong gang also had their skulls broken. When the fight occurred, police officers from the Second Precinct of the Fifth District arrived and arrested those who remained, as the others had fled. All the injured and the two original leaders, Wang Anguo and Yang Zaimo, were taken to the police station. Yesterday, they were transferred to the court. However, Qiu Qingyu of the Hubei gang died in the courthouse waiting room before he could be examined or interrogated. Upon seeing this, the bailiffs reported to Prosecutor Ren, who opened the court for a preliminary hearing. According to the Hubei gang, Wang Anguo colluded with Zhu Fuzheng and Zhu Zuoshu and others from the Kaiping Bureau coal-carrying gang, plotting murder and demanding justice. The Shandong gang claimed that the Hubei gang was usurping their position and attacking them. Each side presented their own version of events. The judge ordered the coroner to first examine the injured and then examine Qiu Qingyu's body, fill out the autopsy report, send the injured to the Tongde Hospital, and detain the defendants to await investigation.</p>
<h3>Major Kidnapper Involved in Sixty-One Cases Transferred to Jiaxing and Then Chongde</h3>
<p>Zhu Rensheng, a major kidnapper from Chongde County, Zhejiang, nicknamed "Master,"</p>
<p>formed a gang that committed sixty-one cases in Chongde, Hang County, Deqing, and Wuxing counties.</p>
<p>The four counties had been trying to arrest him without success. After learning that the bandit had fled to Shanghai, Qian Xinrong, a detective from the Chongde County Public Security Bureau, along with Supervisor Pan Yiqing, and Li Nianyuan, the captain of the detective team of the Security Office, followed him to Shanghai. Through deception, they arrested him at the South Railway Station the other day and sent him to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for detention,</p>
<p>awaiting official documents from Shanghai to extradite him back to Chongde County. Yesterday, it was learned that the Chongde County government had sent a telegram ordering the original detectives and others to meet them and take him back to their area for trial. Therefore, Qian Xinrong, the captain of the detective team of Chongde County, and others went to the Public Security Bureau to apply for the extradition of the bandit leader Zhu Rensheng. Yesterday afternoon at 6 p.m., they hired a car from the South Railway Station's Mingxing Automobile Company to escort him to the North Railway Station, where he boarded the Beijing-Hangzhou special express train to Jiaxing. There he was transferred to another train to be sent to the Chongde County Government Court for trial.</p>
<h3>Record of the Trial of the Assassin of Cao Chenglin</h3>
<p>Poisoned Due to Uneven Profit Sharing in Gambling Den; Jiang Kuan Yu Released After Investigation Found No Connection</p>
<p>Cao Chenglin, a Yangzhou native residing at No. 9, Lane 237, Dong Youheng Road in the Public Concession, nicknamed "Little Cowhide," was a low-level rogue in the Hongkou area. On the night of May 15th of last year, at 10:30 p.m., he was assassinated by an enemy at the intersection of Xixinqiao Street and Caishi Street in the French Concession. Jin Jiulin, the inspector of the special agency of the French Concession Police, Zhang Ziying, the chief detective, and Zhou Bingcheng and Zhou Yaoting, the deputy detectives, investigated and found that Wang Caibao (26 years old), a Zhenjiang native who worked as a foot masseur and lived at No. 12 Xiaozhong Li, Menghualou Street in the Chinese area, was the perpetrator. On the afternoon of the 6th of this month, at 6 p.m., Wang was arrested at the entrance of Taiyuanfang Alley, Caishi Street, along with a suspect, Jiang Kuan Yu (33 years old, Jurong native, foot masseur, Wang's teacher, residing at No. 20 Chunde Li, Lanweiai Road). They were taken to the police station and sent to the Second Special District Court for interrogation and investigation. This has been previously reported. The police station's investigation of the case has concluded. Yesterday afternoon at 3:30 p.m., Criminal Court President Wang Gangxu, accompanied by Secretary Ren Qiwu, presided over the trial in the First Criminal Court. First, Gu Shouxi, the police station's lawyer, stated the case, saying that the first defendant, Wang Caibao, admitted that due to uneven profit sharing in the gambling den, he was instigated by Baiyan Awu, who is still at large, on the morning of May 15th of last year. At 6 p.m. that night, he and Baiyan Awu were waiting at the corner of Xixinqiao Street and Caishi Street, and Xiao Tongjiang, who is still at large, lured Cao Chenglin out of room 21 of the Nanyang Hotel on Xixinqiao Street. He then fired two shots at Cao's head, and Xiao Tongjiang also fired a shot at Cao's ribs. After the incident, they fled and were only apprehended now. As for the second defendant, Jiang Kuan Yu, the investigation found that he was not involved in the case and was falsely accused by the first defendant due to a grudge. The police station is prosecuting the first defendant for premeditated murder under Article 284, Paragraph 1 and Article 285, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Code and requests a trial. The police station is not prosecuting the second defendant and requests approval. Next, Cao Hongru, the father of the victim, Cao Chenglin, submitted a statement saying that his son Chenglin was tragically murdered and requested justice. Wang Caibao confessed that he had known Baiyan Awu and Xiao Tongjiang, who are still at large, for more than a year and often met in Taiyuanfang Alley. On the morning of May 15th of last year, at 10 a.m., I was at the entrance of Taiyuanfang Alley when Baiyan Awu invited me to a teahouse on Huagen Road. He told me that a gambling den was set up at No. 1 Yuqing Li on Xixin Road, and Little Cowhide was causing trouble and causing losses.</p>
<h3>Dark Night, High Winds, and a Vast Sea Sweeps Away a Weak Woman with Raging Waves</h3>
<p>Li Wenfang Seemed to Have Infinite Secrets; the Contents of Her Suicide Note Hide the Truth</p>
<p>Yesterday, this newspaper reported on a woman's patriotic suicide by drowning. According to another report, there are slight differences from what was reported yesterday. It is recorded below: Li Wenfang, a woman from Guangdong, is 24 years old. She received a considerable education in her youth. Her parents died early, and there is only an elderly grandmother in the family. Four years ago, her grandmother forced her to marry a certain military officer as a concubine, but Wenfang had high aspirations and was unwilling to exchange her body for money to be a plaything for others. She angrily left Guangdong alone and eventually arrived in Hangzhou. On the way, she met Ms. Wen Duanshen, a student at the Agricultural College of Zhejiang University, and thus became acquainted with Ms. Wei, the secretary of the college. Wei saw that she was lonely and pitiful and soon introduced her to the Zhejiang Provincial Silk Reeling Factory as a female worker administrator. During the factory's holiday, Wenfang went on a trip to Shandong with Ms. Wen. On the 19th of this month, they boarded the Taikoo Company's Xinjiang steamer in Qingdao to return to Hangzhou via Shanghai. Unexpectedly, the next day (20th), late at night, Wenfang, while Ms. Wen was sound asleep in the second-class cabin, secretly got up, wrote a suicide note, left it on the stool, and privately went out of the room and jumped into the sea. It was about 1 a.m. the next morning, just when the ship was passing through the Tongsha waters. The sea was merciless, and in an instant, Wenfang's body was swept away. After Ms. Wen discovered this and asked the captain to stop the ship for rescue, all traces of her had disappeared. After the ship arrived at the port, the captain kept Wenfang's suicide note and sent it to the British Consulate in this port for filing yesterday (Monday) morning at 10 a.m. The customs water police station also sent Detective Yao Guofa to board the ship yesterday morning to inquire about the situation from the captain and copied the suicide note for filing. The original text is recorded below:</p>
<p>Duanshen, please don't panic now, stay calm and don't</p>
<p>make a noise, because if you make a noise, I'm afraid something unexpected will happen, which will be unfavorable to you. I'm afraid you will suffer, so I solemnly tell you that if the waiter asks you where I went, you can say that I am sick and went to the steerage and will come back. If he asks again, you can tell him that I am sleeping in the steerage and won't come here. At the same time, you must be flexible and change your methods, and never say that I died by jumping into the sea, because I am afraid of inconveniences. At the same time, I don't want others to know about my affairs. You must pay special attention to this point. If someone asks you, you can say that I died of illness, but not that I jumped into the sea. No one else should know about this except Mr. Wei and you. At this time, although I am in the earth, my soul is begging you to do what you are doing for me. I also have a package of things, which were given to me by others two years ago. I have kept them. Because I forgot to give them to Mr. Wei this time in Shanghai, I now ask you to hand them over to Mr. Wei on my behalf. At the same time, when you go to Hangzhou, tell Factory Director Li An that I died of illness. As for the salary for June, listen to him. When he pays it, you can take it and use it. If he doesn't pay it, don't argue with him. The advance payment for May should not be a problem. He has approved it for me. At the same time, you must not tell him. I hope you can help me find a way to avoid the gossip of the people in society. Duanshen, why would I have the idea of ​​being tired of the world? I won't say it, you know it. I am the most miserable person in the world, especially a lonely person who has tasted all kinds of misery. I have seen through everything a long time ago, and when I came to Hangzhou from Guangdong four years ago, I already had the idea of ​​being tired of the world. Who would have thought that I would delay until today to do it? Alas, I knew a long time ago that I was not allowed to live in the world for long, but I had no chance. Now I am fortunate to have this good opportunity, and Mr. is here to accompany me, and I can die in peace. At the same time, please don't be sad, but work hard for me and don't be careless. The package of things for Mr. Wei, you must hand it over to him on my behalf. You must say good things for me to Li An. Alas, in short, I am troubling you. I am grateful to you even in the soil. Alas, my life-saving Duanshen four years ago, alas, it is getting late, and people are quiet. I am going to say goodbye to you. Alas, we have not met in this life, and we will meet again in the next life. I am going to jump into the sea now. Alas, my benefactor Mr. Wei Wen, goodbye forever. Li Wenfang wrote in tears, the second year of the Republic, May 20.</p>
<p>said that Little Cowhide was causing trouble, causing considerable</p>
<p>profits. I hated him so much that I wanted to assassinate him to relieve my hatred and asked me to help. I agreed and asked me to meet at Taiyuanfang at 6 p.m. on the 6th. When I arrived, I met Baiyan Awu and Xiao Tongjiang. Awu gave me a pistol, and we went to the intersection of Xixinqiao Caishi Street to wait. Xiao Tongjiang called Little Cowhide out of the Nanyang Hotel. I fired two shots at his head, and he fell to the ground. Xiao Tongjiang also fired a shot, and everyone scattered. On the 6th of this month, I was arrested in Taiyuanfang. The official asked what Baiyan Awu's surname was. I replied that I only knew his name but not his surname. He asked what Xiao Tongjiang's name was. I replied that I only knew him as Xiao Tongjiang and did not know his real name. He asked if I had a grudge against Little Cowhide. I replied that I had no grudge. He asked if Jiang Kuan Yu was involved in this case. I replied that he was not involved because I used to study foot massage with Jiang, and he often beat me, so I falsely accused him. Jiang confessed that Wang had learned foot massage from him in the past, but he did not learn well, so he was beaten, which led to the false accusation. After verifying the confessions in court, the judge ordered Wang to be returned to custody and adjourned the hearing to June 1st. The police station did not prosecute Jiang Kuan Yu and should be released.</p>
<h3>Heavenly Palace Bloodshed</h3>
<p>Riding a Bicycle Leads to a Major Disaster: Zhou Jifu Dies from a Blade in His Chest; Four Suspects Arrested</p>
<p>Chen Binglan and Luo Wanqing, from Jiangbei, were employees at the Heavenly Palace barber shop opened by Ruan Ming at No. 177 Chongqing Road. At 11 p.m. the other night, Chen and Luo went out and rented two bicycles for a ride in the nearby area. Accidentally and carelessly, they hit a pedestrian named Yang Benchu, leading to a dispute and a fight. Because Yang was alone, he returned disgruntled. Soon, Yang gathered a group of hooligans, hid blades, and suddenly went to the Heavenly Palace barber shop to make trouble. At that time, Zhou Jifu, 28 years old, from Jiangbei, an employee of the shop, entered from the outside. Yang and others questioned him about Chen and Luo's whereabouts. Zhou also replied sternly, leading to another quarrel. One of the hooligans suddenly took out a blade and stabbed Zhou hard in the left chest. He was severely wounded, blood gushed out, and he fell to the ground. Realizing that they had caused a disaster, they scattered like birds and beasts. Someone called the police, who sent Zhou to Renji Hospital. By the time he arrived at the hospital, Zhou had died from his injuries and was sent to the Fei Lun Road Coroner's Office. The Xinzha Police Station was notified and dispatched Chief Detective Li Shizhong and Western Chief Detective Huierkaosi to investigate. They arrested suspects Zhao Heming, Chen Muzhou, Wu Luzhi, and Qiu Gengsheng and took them back to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Criminal Court of the First Special District Court, where Judge Wu Tingqi presided over the preliminary hearing. Li Zhishan, the police station's lawyer, stated the case, saying that the body of the victim, Zhou Jifu, had been sent to the Coroner's Office and had not yet been examined, so he requested a postponement of the case. Judge Wu ordered Zhao Heming and the other three to be detained and the hearing postponed to 23rd in the afternoon. Soon, Prosecutor Zhan Liangce, commissioned by the Special Court, drove to the Coroner's Office to examine the body. He presided over the case and, according to the victim's sister, Zhu Zhou, stated that the deceased's mother and uncle were still in their hometown, and she could not make the decision. After verifying the confession, Zhan ordered the autopsy of the deceased Zhou Jifu, a male, to show a knife wound in the upper part of his left chest, confirming that he died of a knife wound inflicted during his lifetime. The deceased's relatives were still in their hometown in Jiangbei, and the body was temporarily handed over to the Pushan Villa for coffin burial.</p>
<h3>Patrolmen Seize Red Pills</h3>
<p>Plaintiff Says It Was Sugar Substitute, Not True</p>
<p>Zhang Zhuangkang, a Ningbo native, reported to the French Concession Police on the 17th of this month that while walking along the intersection of Minguo Road and Taiwan Road, he was suddenly approached by three bandits who searched him and took away several tens of yuan worth of sugar substitute that he had purchased, and requested an investigation. After an investigation by a French Concession detective, it was found that the case was actually committed by Miao Xianping, a patrolman from the Da Zymingzhong Police Station No. 514.

<h3>First Joint Performance of Chinese and Western Music</h3>
<p>A Sign of World Harmony</p>
<p>Mrs. Strauss, an American missionary, deeply felt that the world was trending toward harmony. The path to harmony naturally begins with music as a prerequisite, unifying auditory senses, progressing to unified thoughts, and only then can true peace be achieved, creating lasting happiness for all of humanity. Therefore, she spared no expense in money and effort to create a combined opera using Chinese stories, gathered Western music experts to compose the music, hired famous Chinese actors as drama instructors, and, fearing the imbalance of Chinese and Western music, also invited the entire orchestra of the Datong Music Association of this city to participate, signifying equal importance. Last night, a grand joint Chinese and Western music performance was held at the Grand Light Theater. First, the Datong Music Association performed the "Great Music of the Morning" (adapted from Eastern Grand Music) in three sections: (1) Bright Sky and Sunshine, (2) Luan and Phoenix Harmonizing, (3) Hundred Birds Paying Homage to the Phoenix, which captured the essence of elegance and peace and was greatly welcomed by the audience. Next, Wei Zhongle, a pipa expert from the association, performed "Ambush from Ten Sides," receiving thunderous applause. This was followed by a speech by Mei Lanfang, and then the Municipal Council Orchestra performed a symphony, which was quite impressive, likely due to the national characteristics of Chinese and Western cultures. Finally, the music opera, a novel concept in China, featured actors who did not speak, their movements following the rhythm of the music, which was no easy feat. The theater was packed that evening, and everyone expressed satisfaction. This event can be considered the first encounter between Chinese and Western music. Seeing this phenomenon, we understand that Chinese and Western music each have their own strengths and neither should be neglected. After the Chinese music performance, more than a dozen Westerners went backstage to express their admiration to Director Zheng of the association, showing that cooperation between Chinese and Western music is possible, and the realization of world harmony and genuine peace is not far off.</p>
<p>The original stolen goods, identified as twenty-nine packets of red pills, worth several hundred yuan, were not saccharin. The Second Special District Court, upon instruction, postponed the re-examination of the case. Recently, another accomplice, He Zonghai, was apprehended and escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court yesterday afternoon. The police lawyer stated that the defendant requested a postponement of the trial to be combined with the case of Miao Xianping. As a result, the plaintiff could not be summoned. After verifying the statement, Judge Wang briefly questioned the defendant and then approved the postponement to the 26th for consolidation with the Miao case. The defendant was returned to custody.</p>

<h3>The Passionate Dancer</h3>
<p>Waiting Until Her Lover's Death</p>
<p>A report from Belgrade states that in Sentai, northern Yugoslavia, there is a dancer named Jill, who is beautiful and skilled. Theaters compete to hire her, and the number of suitors is countless. The young woman always refuses with a smile. One day, she suddenly falls in love with a nobleman from Vienna, who also loves her deeply. Not long after, the nobleman disappears without a trace. The woman is heartbroken and vows never to marry anyone else. She cuts off all worldly ties and waits quietly for her lover's return, continuing to dance for a living. Time flies like water, year after year. Her lover is never heard from again, and the woman grows old and her beauty fades. The theater no longer cares about her, so she has no choice but to dance in the market, earning a meager income. She is already eighty-five years old. Eventually, she is too weak to dance and enters a factory. At this point, the woman has nothing left, except the old dream of lost love still imprinted in her mind. She has now passed away, reportedly living to the age of one hundred, truly the oldest single woman in Yugoslavia.</p>

<p>Special Article</p>
<h3>On the Crisis of Women</h3>
<p>This is a text by Nie Yuntai's mother, Nie Zeng Jifen, addressed to her relatives, published in a family magazine. Seeing its poignant critique of current malpractices and its benefit to social morality, we reprint it here.</p>
<p>Recently, social news in newspapers often reports cases of women being seduced and then abandoned. Generally, women have weak wills and do not understand the treacherous nature of human relations. In recent days, as social interactions between men and women have become public, it is easy to get close to men, and the reason for being deceived is often because the man claims to be unmarried and uses various means of flattery. A young girl with little experience is easily fooled. After losing her virginity or becoming pregnant, the man finds someone else and disregards her. In this situation, no matter what means of negotiation are used, the woman always fails. Even if the man compensates for the loss with money, the woman's most precious chastity and the reputation of her second life have been sacrificed and cannot be remedied. Chastity and reputation are the lifelong happiness of a woman, how can this be calculated in terms of money?</p>
<p>The latest popular slogan is "Women's Liberation." This is truly a crisis for women. In demanding equality between men and women, it even advocates overthrowing chastity, seemingly implying that chastity is a shackle that oppresses women. Overthrowing chastity will liberate women. Or it is said that chastity is a product of the old ethical teachings, so it also advocates overthrowing the old ethical teachings. I now want to ask, after overthrowing chastity, will women truly be liberated? The most extreme practitioners of overthrowing chastity are prostitutes, and the least liberated are prostitutes.</p>
<p>Due to differences in physique and physiology, men are rightly positioned outside and women are rightly positioned inside. Since the beginning of humanity, men and women have divided labor and cooperated, relying on each other to complete today's society. In principle, there is no inequality in life. The one truly unequal fact is that the labor of pregnancy, childbirth, and breastfeeding is borne solely by women, which even the greatest sages and wise men cannot liberate. Looking at countries around the world, from those that worship various old religions to those that adopt the latest theories, their methods of governance and education vary, but there has never been any denigration of chastity. The constitutions of various countries all have provisions for maintaining good social morality, and chastity is the foundation of good social morality.</p>
<p>The patriarchal society is no longer valued as it once was in China today, but we must not mistakenly believe that only patriarchal societies should value chastity. The happiness of the family, the tranquility of society, and the strength of the nation are closely related to chastity. Therefore, all civilized countries make great efforts to maintain it. Hitler's burning of sex books in Germany and the banning of the sale of obscene books and the performance of indecent films in various countries are all of this intent. Unexpectedly, in our country today, there is this bizarre new trend of thought that allows young men and women to indulge their desire for promiscuity in the name of free love. The victims are still mostly women. Therefore, I say that promoting women's liberation with the goal of overthrowing chastity is not a blessing for women, but a crisis for women.</p>
<p>Based on my personal experience, it is still appropriate for a woman's marriage to be chosen by her parents and elders. Parents and elders should also give due respect to their children's wishes or provide faithful guidance when they choose a partner. More importantly, when children are about to reach marriageable age, they should be taught the knowledge that marriage should entail. I also hope that young women will not be dazzled by the beautiful name of women's liberation and will not misunderstand all freedom and suffer its harm. It must be understood that the power of social opinion is far above all slogans and banners. A woman who has dissolute and immoderate behavior is often disdained by her relatives and friends. Before she is abandoned by others, she has already cut herself off from society. If a person's actions cannot win the sympathy of those who know and love them, but instead are scorned, the gains and losses need not be elaborated upon.</p>
<h3>Another Person Contemplating Suicide: Mr. Zhou Wenqing from Wuhu Writes</h3>
<p>I, the author, am a cowherd, and I also studied in an elementary school for three years. Later, my father and mother wanted me to learn how to make glasses. Unexpectedly, the trend of the times led to the invention of foreign gold foil, with interest rates of more than tenfold, so I made new-style glasses. At that time, I could earn fifty or sixty yuan a month, but eventually, things went from bad to worse, and I ruined the business. Adding to this, the Japanese battle in Shanghai further destroyed the original business. Now I live at home, eating away at my savings. I have eaten it all, used it all, pawned it all, sold it all. But my father and mother seem to know that I cannot support them, so they have gone to the immortal realm. Now, I also have a wife, and unfortunately, she has given birth to a nine-year-old son and a three-year-old daughter. Fortunately, my ancestors left me two mu of paddy fields (each mu is worth about ten yuan). But the yield from these two mu is truly pitiful. As soon as we encounter a drought year, we get no rice at all. So, I have accumulated poverty to this day, and I don't even have money for postage. Sir, can you blame me for having suicidal thoughts? In the autumn of last year, another thing disheartened me. I borrowed money from everywhere, and managed to get five yuan to buy copper sheets to make old-style eyeglass frames, hoping to earn some money to get through the New Year. Who knew I would have such an unfortunate fate! I didn't earn any interest, but lost my usual food expenses. Sir, this time, I was even more obsessed with my suicidal dreams! I now want to study a trade, but I am almost thirty years old. I want to be a waiter, cook, worker, anything, but there is no employment agency, no good friends, no powerful relatives, no connections, where can I go? Alas! Why does such a miserable fate fall on my head! There is truly no solution, so I specially ask the consultant of your newspaper to guide me on a bright path!</p>
<p>Answer: Your letter has already explained why "such a miserable fate falls on your head." This is because handicraft industry is swallowed up by machine industry, and China's machine industry is swallowed up and destroyed by imperialism (the political form of aggression of the final class of capitalism). Your question of "no solution" — the unemployment problem — is the common problem of millions and tens of millions of unemployed people in major cities and rural areas. Only by starting with the overall social problem — overthrowing imperialism and its tools — can there be a solution. If you think only from the perspective of the individual, there is never any hope of a solution. If you pay attention to our daily answers, you will see our consistent position on this issue. This is not just empty talk, it is a matter of fact. If you are thinking about your actual life, if you have no other choice, borrow two or three yuan, sell peanuts and melon seeds, or sell newspapers, and you may be able to make a living.</p>

<h3>Representatives of the Chinese Education Association Visited the Russian Ambassador Yesterday to Present a Letter of Opinion</h3>
<p>Received by Secretary Modazhaski, the Russian Ambassador Agreed to Talk with the Representatives Tomorrow Morning and Telegraphed the Russian Government Requesting Reconsideration</p>
<p>The Shanghai Secondary School Teachers' Association, in opposition to the Soviet Union's sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway, dispatched three representatives, Liu Zirun, Shen Zuru, and others, to visit the Soviet Russian Ambassador yesterday morning and present a letter of opinion. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Visiting the Russian Ambassador: The representatives at 10:00 a.m. yesterday</p>
<p>, carrying the association's official letter to the Russian Ambassador Bogomolov and a telegram requesting Mr. Bogomolov to forward it to the Soviet Russian government, went directly to the South Garden of Xinzha Road</p>
<p>, the Soviet Russian Embassy in China, to visit Mr. Bogomolov. Mr. Bogomolov had just arrived in Shanghai by overnight train from Beijing and was too tired, so the embassy's secretary, Modazhaski, received the representatives on behalf of the Russian ambassador. The representatives explained their intentions and presented the letter of opinion and telegram. Mr. Modazhaski said he would convey them to the Russian ambassador. Because the Chinese counselor of the embassy had not yet arrived in Shanghai, he could not give a detailed explanation. The Russian ambassador expressed his willingness to accept them and invited the representatives to have a longer conversation at 10:00 a.m. on the 24th. The representatives then returned to the association.</p>
<p>Telegraphing the Russian Government: The association sent a telegram to the Soviet Russian government yesterday, which reads:</p>
<p>(Salutations omitted) Recently, it has been widely rumored that your government will sell the Chinese Eastern Railway to Japan. According to a Reuters dispatch from Moscow, your Foreign Minister Litvinov has stated that this issue is "already becoming a reality." However, the sovereignty of the Chinese Eastern Railway is clearly stipulated in Article 9, Section 5 of the Sino-Soviet Agreement of 1924, as belonging to both the Republic of China and the Soviet Socialist Republics. Therefore, the disposition of the railway cannot be carried out unilaterally by any country without the consent of both China and Russia. This is a legal necessity. Moreover, at a time when China and Russia are seeking friendship, and the people of both countries are looking forward to joining hands to seek peace in the Far East, your country is disregarding the disapproval of the world and proposing to violate the agreement. This is something that the people of our country, both in and out of government, find deeply surprising and regrettable. In order to safeguard our country's sovereignty, this association hereby telegraphs your government to respect the agreement, reconsider your attitude on this matter, and strengthen our diplomatic relations. We await your reply with hope. Shanghai Secondary School Teachers' Association.</p>
<p>Circulating Telegrams Nationally: The Association, in Response to the Critical Situation, Circulated Telegrams to All</p>
<p>National Citizens, stating: The violent Japanese have already occupied the four northeastern provinces and are now further invading our Pingjin, attempting to swallow our North China. Their wolfish ambitions will never be satisfied. We urge all our compatriots to be mindful of the severity of the situation and the crisis facing our nation. We must quickly rise up to save ourselves from peril. We deeply believe that the violent Japanese can only be resisted by brandishing our weapons and fighting to the death. The disaster is already upon us, and any delay will be fatal. For the sake of the country and the nation, we, the people, have reached the point where we must exert our last efforts. We sincerely hope that all compatriots throughout the country will make urgent plans. The telegram is urgent, and we are filled with grief and indignation. (The rest omitted).</p>

<h3>The Football Team of the Six Newspapers Reunited on the Old Site, Fighting Face to Face at the Sports Field Starting at 4 p.m. Today</h3>
<p>The football teams of the six newspapers have been playing in a round-robin tournament for two weeks now.</p>
<p>After working hard, they continued to work physically. From beginning to end, their spirit was consistent. They did not give up, did not argue, did not boast, and did not blame others. Victory was certainly joyful, but defeat was also glorious. Judging from the past results and performances, the strength of the six teams was about the same. The difference between high and low was very small. For example, in the game between the Xinwen Bao and the Chen Bao at the baseball field the day before yesterday, although the Chen Bao won by a score of one to zero, from the situation on that day, the Xinwen Bao had more opportunities to win than the Chen Bao. The Kung Fu of the former Qian Yima won a lot of applause from the whole stadium. Unfortunately, he was not successful and was attacked by the opponent. Therefore, although he lost, he could also comfort himself. Moreover, the tenacity of the Min Bao in battle was also very admirable. In the game against the Xinwen Bao the day before yesterday, after losing a penalty kick, they finally relied on their persistent spirit and used hard-hitting footwork to create a 1-1 tie. The strength can be seen from this. As for the Shi Bao, it was even more of a fierce and terrifying division. Although they lost three games straight to the Shishi Xinbao, they were also lucky and unlucky. It is impossible to judge heroes by success or failure. It was found that in the first half of the game, the Shi Bao lost a very good opportunity. If it were not for the timely rescue of the Yao Tie Men of the Shishi Xinbao, the Shi Bao might have won the first goal and caused the opposite result in the end. The days are long, there will be opportunities in the future. Straight to the Huanglong, there will be a day. The old Shen Bao has always regarded itself as an old qualification. The call for winning the championship was once high in the clouds. Although it has suffered a small setback now, it is not enough to reduce the power of the old general. Today is the time for the old masters of the six routes to reunite on the old site, exert their full strength, and fight face-to-face. At that time, on Dalin Road, I don’t know how many fans will be alarmed.</p>
<p>[Today's OrderP&gt;</p>
<p>Name of the Participating Team, Start Time, Location, Referee</p>
<p>Shen Bao vs. Shi Bao, 4 p.m., Sports Field, Zhang Longhai, Xinwen Bao vs. Shishi Xinbao, 5 p.m., Sports Field, Zhang Yimin, Min Bao vs. Chen Bao, 6 p.m., Sports Field, Zhang Longhai (Note) Each game starts on time. I hope that the crab generals and shrimp soldiers will arrive at the venue early in military uniforms and wait for mobilization. This order is urgent.</p>
<h3>Acknowledgment from the Six Newspapers</h3>

<h3>Lingnan University Alumnus Volleyball Game Pei Ying Wins Against Pei Zheng 3-2, Tense Situation, Remarkable Performance</h3>
<p>Guangzhou volleyball is known for its development, and Pei Ying and Pei Zheng schools are the pride of</p>
<p>Guangzhou volleyball. In past Far Eastern Volleyball Games, 70-80% of the athletes came from these two schools, hence the honorary title of volleyball's origin. There are no fewer than hundreds of alumni from both schools residing in Shanghai, and many are excellent in volleyball. On the 21st of this month, during the Shanghai Pei Zheng Alumni Association's gathering, they especially invited the Shanghai Pei Ying Alumni Association to have a friendly volleyball match at the Fudan Stadium. At around 4 PM, the audience surrounding the stadium was already a sea of people, as a meeting of heroes and a clash of equals is a rare opportunity. The game started at 4:30 PM. The Pei Ying alumni, with their effective coordination and defense, easily took two games. The Pei Zheng alumni returned the favor in difficult situations, winning back two games and tying the score. In the fifth game, both sides were cautious and focused, making the performance the most exciting. The scores of the two sides were always closely chasing each other, with a difference of no more than one or two points at most. Finally, the Pei Ying side won the final victory due to their close coordination and effective offense and defense. This performance of both teams can be called satisfactory. Spectators said that the strength of both teams is more than or equal to the volleyball teams of major middle schools in Shanghai. Pei Ying alumni such as Flying General Cao Tingzan and Li Leijun were unable to participate in the game due to work, otherwise, the excitement of the performance and the mystery of the art would have been even more spectacular than yesterday.</p>

<h3>Overview of Education in Various European Countries (Recorded by Si Lu Bingqian)</h3>
<p>After production, check the baby's physical condition for defects. If there are defects, send</p>
<p>them to the central health area for medical treatment. There are designated doctors visiting every day for examination. The central health area is fully equipped with many rooms and beds, all clean, and there is also isolation construction for infectious diseases. After three weeks, if their defects have healed, they are sent back to their homes, where nurses still visit frequently. If the baby has a more serious illness, they can be sent to a specialized hospital for treatment. When children enter kindergarten, they are still subject to government control. There are many, many kindergartens established by the government, which can take on the responsibility of education in place of the family. For very poor families, the government not only does not charge fees but also provides meals. In addition, there are nurseries attached to kindergartens. If the baby's mother is working in a factory and does not have time to care for them, they can be fostered in the nursery. There are many cradles in the nursery, specifically for fostering babies. This method is actually a public education approach for children. After children grow up, the government also has various restrictions to prevent them from being destroyed or maimed without reason. After entering elementary school, they continue to pay attention to care. Dental and ophthalmological hospitals are set up in various places to investigate the bodies of children. Although the equipment in these hospitals is simple, it is very necessary. (3) Curriculum Reform: Originally, countries only had one or two physical education, music, and art classes each week, but now they are also paying close attention to them. Not only schools are doing this, but the general public also has the opportunity to participate in sports. There are sports facilities everywhere. Countries like Germany and France pay particular attention to physical fitness, national activities, and the expression of fortitude. Our Chinese Tai Chi, Jianzi kicking, and physical fitness training may be okay, but they cannot express a spirit of fortitude and courage at all. This is a shortcoming. In the future, we should open up new paths for sports, focusing on both physical training and the expression of national spirit. In addition, China also lacks music and art. Almost every child in foreign countries can sing and play instruments, but China cannot. Moreover, Chinese songs such as "Drizzling Rain" are enough to corrupt the national spirit. Foreign kindergartens regard painting as important as writing, but China is perfunctory and does not value it. I hope that Chinese schools will seek active reforms in the curriculum. (4) School Training: European countries train students strictly, especially Russia. The restrictions on men and women are very strict. Although they work together, their moral behavior is very high, from elementary school to university. There are also students who are thirty or forty years old. When they see visitors, they stand up to pay respect, as a sign of their greatness and ability to obey orders. The students in China are not like this. I hope everyone will use a fearless spirit to thoroughly rectify this and cultivate a good academic atmosphere and law-abiding youth, so that social order can be stable. The bad academic atmosphere is something that those responsible for training young people should bear a corresponding responsibility for. Regarding youth movements, Russia, Italy, and Germany all have organizations and missions. Germany has fewer political missions. Russia and Italy use the power of the party to train young people very strictly. (End)</p>

<h3>Shout</h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>Shouting, this is the only weapon of our Great Republic of China. What kind of anti-Japanese conferences are held, what kind of</p>
<p>demonstrations are held, we must shout, we must shout loudly and specially, shouting to the point of enthusiasm, (hole) until the neck develops a Guan Yu-like color, humming with the fifth and sixth tendons, and sweat droplets roll down the forehead; but, apart from shouting, there is no more practical work! This is called anti-Japanese shouting, national salvation shouting.</p>
<p>The most skilled shouter is Huiming in the Romance of the West Chamber. He said: "With one shout, the rocky mountains shake with a clatter." He also said: "Relying on Buddha's power, I shouted, and from afar I saw heroes unfurling embroidered banners. See, half a myriad of bandit soldiers are scared out of their wits." Unfortunately, Huiming's shouting skills have long been lost. If the Chinese people, who are good at shouting, could also learn his supernatural powers, would they still be afraid of the enemy's arrogance? If they can shake the rocky mountains with a shout, they will certainly be able to shout and make the volcanoes of Tokyo erupt. If they can scare half a myriad of bandit soldiers out of their wits with one shout, then how can the enemy troops violating North China withstand us shouting a few times, they would have already fallen off the planes and crashed into the armored cars.</p>
<p>Some people say: Although shouting is useless, it can still express a kind of popular sentiment; now the situation is serious, and the</p>
<p>lost territory is expanding, but the sound of shouting is dying down day by day. What is this phenomenon?</p>
<p>I say: The sound of shouting slogans is certainly dying down; the sounds of shouting suffering, shouting pain, shouting to heaven, shouting to parents, shouting to children, are growing thicker day by day. What do we think when we hear these shouts? The shouts on the battlefield are certainly shouting suffering, shouting pain, shouting to heaven, shouting to parents, shouting to children; the shouts off the battlefield are shouting to prostitutes, shouting to gambling, shouting to opponents, shouting for another round. What do we think when we hear these shouts?</p>
<h3>Marching Towards Death</h3>
<p>— Huo Xueming</p>
<p>Blood flowers flow on the snowy border, red joy, the sun</p>
<p>shines, the moon also shines, even the gloomy rainy night faintly flutters with a vigorous strange stench. There, military uniforms are buried in the dust, bayonets are buried in contracted flesh, warhorses have their frost-covered hooves chopped off and run madly, iron birds skillfully drop heavy shells, a dense atmosphere of killing permeates the command line, brave bugles blow, helpless moans cry, there is no fragrance of flowers, no charming smiles, no strong alcohol, no comfortable eiderdown blankets, and even less music, dancing, friction of flesh, and even culture!</p>
<p>But even if all you see and hear is the bones in the wilderness,</p>
<p>the gossamer-like breath, the rough voice, the misty eyes, and the soul leaping in the smoke of war, the resentment and horses in the sulfur mine, all of this plunges from the peak of life to the deep ravine of death; but this terrible picture does not stop the massacre of mankind, who claims to be civilized and moral. Moreover, they intensify the sharpening of the knives, replenish the sacrificing comrades on the front line, and stage the great historical drama in the flames of extreme suffering.</p>
<p>Defend against the arrows with armor, maintain our own safety with iron arms, resist the iron hooves of the invaders with force, for the nation, for justice, for peace; we, the people of China, should march forward fearlessly, fight, kill, and complete the glory of heroic death! Push away the lover's chest, Chinese ladies! Please sing,</p>
<p>please sing Gui Weigu's poem:</p>
<p>The feathered edict has my husband's name, how dare I let him stay? Don't believe the partridge's cry, "Brother, you can go!"</p>
<p>Don't think that death is a terrible name, people will eventually</p>
<p>have inevitable death! It is our enemies who we should kill, but those who don't allow us to die are our friends.</p>
<h3>Tribulus</h3>

<p>The more women who advocate free love, the more conditions involving money</p>
<p>they attach to when they get married. Talking about the sanctity of love to modern girls is like playing the lute to a cow.</p>
<p>If women could all use domestic goods, their power would be ten times greater than the bombs of the traitor-exterminating corps.</p>
<p>A modern girl who can wear a cheongsam made of domestic cloth can already be called an outstanding patriotic woman.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes of Lu Zijia</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>The culprits who started the war in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, even women and children know, are Qi Fuwan and Lu</p>
<p>Zijia. Lu Zijia passed away a few days ago. A former servant of Lu's narrated his anecdotes, saying: When Jiangsu and Zhejiang started the war, and the fierce fighting was intense, Lu was suffering from a shortage of military pay. He knew that Xia Chao had a very rich collection, so he summoned him to the superintendent's office and asked him to borrow 500,000 gold yuan for military expenses. Xia was stingy and refused to agree. Lu was angry and stopped him. Xia was ashamed and could not contain himself. When he returned to the police station, he gathered his confidants and sent a large sum of money to persuade Commander Zhang to defect, and communicated with Min Sun. After the matter was confirmed, Lu was greatly frightened, not caring about fighting, and hurriedly transported countless wooden boxes, abandoning Lin'an and fleeing to Shanghai. It is said that the wooden boxes were filled with jewels and playthings, and their value was astonishing. Lu had a mother, over seventy years old, who was vegetarian and worshipped Buddha, with compassion as her heart. She did not think that her son should fight for land and kill people in the fields. She repeatedly warned her son to quickly stop the war in order to maintain peace. When Lu arrived in Shanghai, she summoned him to her house and instructed him: "My family does not worry about food and clothing, how can we cause suffering to the people of Jiangsu and Zhejiang because of power and territory? If you do not immediately stop the war, I will die before you, pleading for the people." Lu was helpless and decided to leave Shanghai for Japan. Because many things went against his wishes, his mood became very bad. When he arrived in Shanghai, the beard under his chin was still dark and shiny, but unexpectedly, from Shanghai to Beppu, to Shenyang, to Nanjing, the dark beard turned white in less than three months. Jokers compared him to Wu Zixu passing through Zhaoguan in those years.</p>
<p>It is also said that when Lu encountered difficult things, he would sit quietly in a room to think about the solution. He read the newspaper every day, and he concentrated on reading the newspaper with single-minded attention. At this time, family members and servants could not report anything, and even if they did, he would not hear it. A newly arrived servant asked Lu for instructions on a certain matter. Lu was reading the newspaper, heard the servant's words, and slightly nodded his head. The servant thought he had obtained Lu's permission and went ahead and did it. Unexpectedly, he was greatly blamed by Lu afterwards. The servant said that he had asked for instructions and was granted permission, but Lu refused to admit that this had happened. Because he did not pay attention to anything else when reading the newspaper, he certainly did not know what the servant was saying. Afterwards, servants would often wait for him to finish reading the newspaper before daring to report things to him.</p>

<h3>Fourth Company Commander of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Seven: Severing Affection with a Few Words, Closing the Door to Grieve Bitterly, Bearing Righteousness on One Shoulder, Discussing Business Over Wine</p>
<p>When Jiang saw him in this state, she was really a little confused. She held the edge of the pit and leaned over</p>
<p>and asked him in front of him: What is this for? Guizhi took out a handkerchief from her pocket to wipe her eyes, sobbing and crying, still ignoring her mother. Jiang said: If you don't tell me the reason, I'll be worried. Were you bullied by someone? Or is it something else? Guizhi said: Nothing happened. Jiang said: If nothing happened, why are you crying like this? Guizhi thought that if she didn't explain this to her mother, she was afraid that her mother would suspect something bad. She said: Nothing happened, it's just that the Gan family is looking down on me. Jiang then understood that he was angry with the Gan family. She said: We haven't been in contact with them for a long time, how can you still be angry with them? Guizhi only wiped her tears with her handkerchief and did not speak. Jiang said: This is strange, you are crying because of people you haven't been in contact with for a long time? It doesn't matter, we will never have contact with them again. Is it worth crying for them? How could Guizhi answer her this sentence, she could only continue to endure her tears, lowered her head and sat on the pit. But Jiang was very happy to see him suffering like this. She thought that the reason why Guizhi was unwilling to agree to the marriage with Battalion Commander Zhao was because Gan Er was holding him back. Now that Gan Er had broken off contact with him, if she mentioned the marriage with the Zhao family again, he would no longer refuse. Jiang thought like this, and she felt very happy in her heart. She didn't say anything that day. The next day, she chatted with Guizhi casually, and talked about how good Battalion Commander Zhao was, to see what Guizhi's attitude was like. Although Guizhi did not agree with it, she did not object to it, but just smiled slightly. Seeing this situation, Jiang gained a few more points of certainty. The next day, Jiang waited for Battalion Commander Zhao to come home and pretended to be inquiring about Battalion Commander Guan. She came to the backyard to talk to him. Zhao Ziqiang smiled and said: Old lady is asking about Big Brother Guan, you've come to the right place. I'm inviting my brothers to drink spring wine at home today. When he comes back, I'll let him go to your house to sit.</p>
<h3>Shanghai People's Phlegm</h3>
<p>— Chi Fo</p>
<p>'The road is like a tiger's mouth, don't walk in the middle,' this is</p>
<p>a motto in the 'Shanghai Guide.' Friends who are afraid of death and want to live will obey this as a golden rule. In fact, although Shanghai is full of gold, it is also full of crises: stray bullets, robbers, kidnappings... Aren't these things uniquely abundant in Shanghai? Cars certainly kill people, and</p>
<p>electric trams and robbers also kill people. If you are not careful, or join in the fun and look at women, enjoying yourselves with your eyes, either a truck will come from behind, or a trolleybus will suddenly dart out in front, with rickshaws on the left and bicycles on the right, truly getting you into a dilemma, unable to retreat, becoming Xiang Yu at Gaixia, unable to commit suicide in time, but having to be scolded 'dying unjustly' by the driver!</p>
<p>Careful and cautious friends, because they have already been</p>
<p>explicitly deprived of their freedom to walk on the road, have to exercise their natural 'freedom to walk' on the cement pavement. But just when they have found freedom, they are not allowed to enjoy it peacefully. If you are not careful, the friends coming and going on the cement pavement will spit phlegm on you, splashing a few drops of fragrant spittle on your face. They are fulfilling their responsibility of spreading germs, and how can you criticize them? Sometimes, perhaps a mouthful of thick phlegm will jump out from the counter of our big store, landing right on your clothes or shoes. Perhaps a basin of beauty's wash water, more fragrant than rouge, will pour down from the overhanging building, a thorough and exhaustive anointing. It is also your good fortune, today's adventure! Besides Xu Luzhai of the Yuan Dynasty and Luo Yifeng of the Ming Dynasty, who wouldn't envy this kind of 'gift from a beauty'?</p>
<p>Correction: In the article 'Sketches of Gold Transactions' published on the 18th, 'the short sellers laugh until their stomachs hurt' was mistakenly written as 'the long sellers laugh until their stomachs hurt,' and 'the long sellers saw the blood-red headline in the newspaper' was mistakenly written as 'the short sellers saw the blood-red headline in the newspaper.' These two mistakes are hereby corrected.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Notes</p>
<h3>Lake District News</h3>
<p>— Tianxu Wosheng</p>
<p>At dawn on the 15th of May, rumors spread that someone had hanged themself on Ge Hill. The Weixiao Photography Studio rushed to take a photograph. The person was dressed in worker's clothes, head bowed and eyes closed, hands and feet fully extended, without protruding tongue or any horrifying features, showing that they had calmly embraced death and had not struggled. On the 17th, at daybreak, at the foot of Solitary Hill, another person had hanged themself from a tree. Weixiao also went to take a photograph, which is still being developed, so the image has not yet been seen. However, it is said that the person was wearing Chinese clothing, with relatively new leather shoes, dark hands and a fair complexion, and appeared to be about forty years old. At that time, a rickshaw puller passing by West Ling sighed and said to me, "I once tried to hang myself but could not die. Those who can die are truly blessed." I was surprised by his words and inquired about them. He stopped his cart under a tree, sat down, and said, "I was originally a sedan chair carrier. The burden of my family was very heavy. My family of five, women, originally earned a living by grinding tin foil and pasting ingots. Even my young children, only five or six years old, could break hemp threads and string ingots to help with the work. In recent years, superstitions have been eradicated, and sedan chairs have been eliminated. My eight-year-old son studies at the village school, and my nine-year-old daughter is a servant. My older brother and sister are learning to be workers, but have not succeeded, and now they are losing their means of earning a living. My wife also ran away from me, so I sought death, but I was rescued. I almost died and then revived. I remember that during the time I was dying, my throat was strangled, and my blood vessels bulged, the pain was indescribable. After carefully considering ways to die, I realized that there was no safe way, so I no longer dare to seek death. However, in the absence of any joy in life, I await the arrival of the day of death. It is truly difficult to be a person." I said, "If people can only overcome their fear of death, then there is nothing they cannot do. Charging into battle, disregarding life and death, is true courage. Why not join the army?" He replied, "A friend of mine once did that, but during the complete annihilation of his army, he was the only one who survived by luck. His abdomen and back were pierced, and he stayed in the hospital for three months, enduring immense pain. After recovering, he went to the front line again, but was eventually withdrawn due to the retreat and returned to his life of seeking death but being unable to die. Moreover, due to his disability, he could no longer pull a rickshaw, but relied on temple fairs to beg for money to survive. Now, he has nowhere to go, so he believes that he should become a monk, but he cannot find the way to enter the monastery. What can be done?" As he spoke, someone hired his cart. I wanted to give him some money for the conversation, but he had already quickly left. I thought of the Pure Land Society's regulations that I had heard about at the Six Harmonies Temple, which contained a subtle and useful purpose. Our designs are truly not as skillful and clever as theirs. The members of the Pure Land Society only recite the Buddha's name as their daily task, sitting cross-legged in the hall, with the bell and fish as a rhythm, which is called "Universal Prayer." All those who join the society are provided with clothing, food, and lodging by the temple, and are given one yuan per month for the rest of their lives. After death, they are cremated, and the society recites the Buddha's name for three days, which is their right to enjoy. As for their duties, they only need to sit and meditate and recite the Buddha's name with the others. At first, I was very curious as to how they could support so many people, sixty or seventy in total. Assuming each person's monthly expenses were ten yuan, the annual expenses were nearly ten thousand, where did the money come from? I then heard a monk from Fenglin Temple tell his patron that scripture chanters are paid by the day, one yuan per person, and Universal Prayer is paid by the hall, sixteen yuan per person for seven days. I wondered why the value was so different. He said, "The chanters are all high-ranking monks, and they are especially diligent with three sessions a day." Supposing that the ghosts of Solitary Hill and Ge Hill, as well as the rickshaw puller who sought death but could not find it, knew about this path to life, they would undoubtedly convert to the Pure Land Society. However, I do not know what the procedures are for joining. I once heard that my nephew, Shaohua, went to Liuyun Temple to request to become a monk, but was told that he could not be accepted without a monk certificate. As for the origin of monk certificates, when I was in Huai'an, I once served as an altar supervisor on behalf of the county magistrate. Initially, there were nearly a hundred people, but after seven days, half of them were eliminated. After another seven days, there were even fewer remaining, and even when it came to burning incense on their heads, with tears streaming down their faces, there were still those who were rejected. And learning the rituals of wearing the cassock on the body was even more serious than military drills. Once you obtain a certificate, it is said that you can travel to the Five Sacred Mountains and stay overnight anywhere, but in reality, staying overnight is only allowed for one night and three meals, not like the Pure Land Society's lifelong support. I greatly admire the ingenuity of the Pure Land Society's plan. Being able to support one monk means that fifteen people will not lose their jobs. Because all their needs for clothing and food still rely on others. From the farmers in spring, the woodcutters, the cooks, to the vegetable growers, the tofu grinders, the cotton planters, the yarn spinners, the cloth weavers, the garment makers, the shoemakers, the cushion makers, the incense and candle makers, the manure collectors, the firewood collectors, to the firewood for cremation, if you count them, all those whose livelihoods depend on the life of the monk receive indirect benefits. On the other hand, superstitious people wholesale ingots of tin foil with excess money and set them on fire, and those who rely on them for a living, such as those who collect ingot ash, refiners, foil beaters, paper grinders, mulberry planters, paper makers, ingot pasters, paste makers, hemp planters, needle makers, bamboo splitters, drill makers, pen and ink makers, as well as sedan chair carriers, rickshaw pullers, and those who provide errands, are far more than fifteen people. Therefore, if one non-farming, non-weaving, neither-dead-nor-alive monk is kept in the world, it can prevent thirty people from losing their jobs. Its merit is truly immeasurable. Our Confucian scholars cannot match it. We should have designed for ten farmers, artisans, and merchants, but we could not do as they did. No wonder Fan Zhongyan used it as a famine relief strategy when he governed Hangzhou. His wisdom could be reached, but his folly could not be reached.</p>

<h3>Shanghai-Zhejiang News: Gold Price Rebounds by $9.70</h3>
<p>Supply and demand in the market are different, and the situation is balanced. The source of "smelted red gold" is slightly abundant, and the bid price is gradually decreasing.</p>
<p>Since the gold market declined last Saturday, London's large gold bars rose by 68.75, American silver rose by 25, and exchange rates rose and fell. However, the forward silver price on the Gold and Silver Exchange shrank by 7%. Private telegrams fell to 5.625. People's hearts turned stable. The gross price opened and immediately rose to $70. Foreign exchange was also tight, rising after the opening, following the domestic market. Before long, the foreign exchange market eased, and the price returned lower. HSBC's posted rates revealed that both British and American exchange rates had not risen or fallen. At this time, the situation was still flat. After entering the market, it advanced and retreated with the foreign exchange market. The later market was the same, with limited transactions and a mediocre process. During the day, Yuan Maoyong tried hard to sell, about more than a thousand bars, while the speculator Yang purchased them heavily. (Yuanmao, etc.) This led to a balanced situation and confused people. The price of "smelted red gold" had no fixed premium. The initial bid was 61 yuan. The source from the north was relatively abundant, while the outlet was lacking, so it should be reduced. Swap prices for May-July were 34 yuan discount, May-June 20 yuan, and June-July 13 yuan. The day's market situation is recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 974 yuan, a rebound of 10 yuan and 8 jiao compared to last Saturday. "Articles"</p>
<p>opened at 4.5 yuan. The foreign exchange market opened tight. Recent</p>
<p>selling price: British exchange rate, one shilling and three pence; American exchange rate, 24 yuan and 18.75. Hengxing, Bingxing, Fuchang, Yifengyong, Hengyu all entered. Mitsui bought American dollars for September at 75, and Huabi bought July at 43.75, so they swarmed to 7 yuan and above. Dongya and Shanghai did American dollars for September at 68.75 and at 7.5 yuan. HSBC issued 68.75 for September, and sold to Zhengjin at 25 for this month. Zhengchang, Fuyu, and Fuchang sold off to within 4 yuan. Before long, HSBC again placed 625 for August. Yuan Maoyong vigorously sold it for 3 yuan. HSBC's posted rates for British and American exchange rates remained unchanged. At this time, the price hovered around 4 yuan. Mitsui ate American dollars for September at 93.75, before long at 81.25, which was once difficult to settle. Zhaofengchang fell and took it in, rising to 6 yuan and 2 jiao. Zhejiang placed 68.75 for American dollars in August. Zhengchang continued to sell, and Yuan Maoyong still sold with enthusiasm. The trend then fell, hovering and declining, once retreating to 1 yuan and 3 jiao. Feifayong limited purchases but did not get it. Yuanmao, Bingxing, Xiexingyong, Chunyuanyong, etc., repeatedly entered the bars, and still managed to pull it up. Xingye ate 875 for September. Fuchang and Zhifengyong also had buying appetite, and rose to 5 yuan and 7 jiao. However, the trend hovered, and after entering the market, it was difficult to sell American dollars for September at 24 yuan and 875. Hengxing came on the market to sell off, and retail investors vigorously pressed down, falling again to 2 yuan and 7 jiao. Zhongfu ate 93.75 for September. Bingxing requisitioned up to 4.5 yuan. Before long, the noon closing was 973 yuan and 8 jiao, and the "articles" were auctioned at 4 yuan.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at 973 yuan and 3 jiao, and the "articles" opened at 2.4 yuan. At first, due to the retail investors' pushing, the price hovered around 4 yuan. Then, because HSBC ate 75 American dollars for August, it rose to 4 yuan and 8 jiao. Later, because Mitsui sold 31.25 to Citibank for May, and Huabi placed half a yuan for July, the price retreated to 2.4 yuan. At this time, the transaction was scattered. The market was extremely idle. Huabi ate American dollars for September at 93.75. Jiatai came to purchase, and people's hearts seemed stable, gradually rising to 5 yuan and 7 jiao. Huabi issued 25 for American dollars in May to Huayi, and the trend was downstream. Before long, Huabi again placed half a yuan for July. Zhaofengchang and Wanxing both had sales, and the situation was even lower. In addition, Huabi and Mitsui did 68.75 for American dollars in August, and Qianchangxiang sold to within 4 yuan. Huabi once ate 75 in August, slightly holding it back, but Qianchangxiang came to sell again, but the amount was small. At this time, 75 American dollars in August were difficult to sell. Yuanmao came on the market to vigorously sell, and Fuyu also sold, falling to 1 yuan and 8 jiao. Tianfengyong entered the bars, and the closing price was 972 yuan and 9 jiao, and the "articles" were auctioned at 3 yuan. It was found that the highest price of the day was 977 yuan and 5 jiao, and the lowest was 971 yuan and 3 jiao, with a range of 6 yuan and 2 jiao. As a result, it rebounded by 9 yuan and 7 jiao compared to the noon closing last Saturday.</p>
<p>The posted price was 23 yuan and</p>
<p>75 because HSBC Bank's American exchange rate remained unchanged. The price of alloy gold was 1010 yuan, 5 jiao and 3 fen. According to</p>
<p>the closing price, it was about 30 yuan, 6 jiao and 3 fen, less than 9 yuan and 7 jiao less than last Saturday. The price for this month was 1006 yuan, June was 986 yuan, and July was 974 yuan. The morning water replenishment was 1006 yuan, and the afternoon was 1005 yuan.</p>
<p>Transactions in the market were still active in the morning, but idle in the afternoon. In summary, Yuan Maoyong,</p>
<p>Fuchang, Fuyu, Yifengyong, Zhengchang, Hengxing, Shunli,</p>
<p>Daxingyong all sold, while Yuanmao, Bingxing, Xiexingyong, Jiatai, Tianfengyong, Hengyu, Zhaofengchang, etc., entered. Yifengyong, Zhaofengchang, Fuchang, etc., first selected to enter and then exit. There were not many transactions between the Dalian gang and the Guangdong gang, and they slightly pressed out. The total number of July chips was 17,164 bars. The transactions of "smelted red gold" and swaps were still quiet. Although the initial opening price of "smelted red gold" yesterday was calculated at 61</p>
<p>yuan, it felt overpriced because the supply exceeded the demand.</p>
<p>The price fell, and the situation was chaotic, with no fixed price, about from 55</p>
<p>yuan to 58 yuan. This was because the outlet was cut off again, and the source from the north surged. The market lacked buyers. It was heard that the spot number Yingfengheng once sold one "ping" to a silver shop, calculated at 66 yuan, which was because the purity was higher. For swaps (June-July), Yuan Maoyong gave Dadacheng 63 bars, 13 yuan; Ruixing gave Yuan Maoyong 63 bars, 14.5 yuan; (May-June) Ruixing gave Yingfengheng 63 bars, 20 yuan; (May-July) Daxingyong gave Qianchangxiang 140 bars, 34 yuan; and Wanxing gave Dadacheng 21 bars and Shenkang gave Hengxing 28, all at 13 yuan. After entering the market, this price was difficult to obtain from the sellers, because the posted price was also close. There were still 2,443 bars remaining for this month and 5,880 bars for June.</p>
<h3>British and American Exchange Rates Tighten and Loosen</h3>
<p>丨Forward Silver Prices Fall Alone丨</p>
<p>The foreign exchange market tightened again yesterday, because although London's large bars rose by 68.75 in the near and far term,</p>
<p>American silver rose by 25, but because the forward silver price fell by 7%, the private telegrams were only 5.625, and people's hearts returned to good. Yesterday morning, the near-term British exchange rate opened at one shilling and three pence, tightening by 125 compared to the previous closing. The American exchange rate was 24 yuan and 18.75, tightening by 25 compared to last Saturday. After the opening, it tightened and loosened, hovering many times. HSBC's posted rates for British and American exchange rates remained unchanged. In the morning market, HSBC tended to place, while Mitsui took. The process seemed to be hardening. The noon closing was flat for British exchange rates and slightly looser for American exchange rates compared to the morning opening. The afternoon market was lonely and extremely mediocre, and the trend seemed harder. Huabi placed out more forcefully. After hovering, the closing selling price for the near term was one shilling, three pence, and 0625, and American exchange rate was 24 yuan and 25. As a result, it was tighter by 0625 (British) and 18.75 (American) compared to last Saturday. The banks HSBC and Huabi were on the placing side, while Shanghai, Mitsui, and Mercantile, etc., were more on the taking side. Gold firms were seen both taking and placing, and slightly exceeded during the day. The day's transactions are recorded below:</p>

<h3>The Overall Situation in the Silver Coin Market is Tranquil</h3>
<p>Since the abolition of the silver standard, the situation in the market has been extremely quiet. In addition,</p>
<p>at present, there is only one type of interbank lending, and the price does not change significantly. Therefore, the difference in interbank lending rates in the middle of last week was only a few points, and the situation was quite stable. However, there were slight changes in the two jiao auxiliary coins, Jiangsu and Guangdong. However, the result was still standing in the original position. As for the market at the beginning of this week (that is, yesterday), the interbank lending rate was still only 8%, which was 2 points better than the previous day. The "huatou" and water adding also felt slightly higher, initially at 1 jiao, 5 fen and 6 points, then to 2 jiao, 2 fen and 3 points, and finally closed at 2 jiao. The transaction of interbank lending bills was more than 5.1 million in the morning market, more than 1.1 million in new transactions, more than 700,000 in the afternoon market, and more than 500,000 in the small general association. The banks received more than 1.78 million silver notes, more than 2.89 million in foreign silver, more than 4.9 million in various cargo exchange guarantees, more than 3.2 million in foreign silver, and 500,000 in warehouse entry. The Chinese banks received more than 3.56 million in foreign silver notes, a total of more than 10.12 million in various cargo exchange tax guarantees, and 800,000 in warehouse exit. The Qianzhuang received more than 45.5 million in foreign public orders, more than 7.5 million in foreign "huatou" funds, 700,000 in various remittance funds, more than 2.1 million in banknote recovery and issuance, and more than 1.7 million in foreign collateral transactions. The outbound cargo included 100,000 from Wuxi and 10 million from Anhui. The Qianzhuang received 200,000 to 300,000 in cash. The market price of auxiliary coins, the Jiangnan small foreign coins were 847 yuan in both the morning and afternoon markets, which was 1 yuan better than the previous day. The transaction was 6,500 jiao in the morning market and 4,000 jiao in the afternoon market. The Guangdong small foreign coins, with supply and demand equal, the market price also had little change, 781 yuan in the morning market and 780 yuan and 2 jiao in the afternoon market, which was 8 jiao smaller. The transaction was 85,000 jiao in the morning market and 20,000 jiao in the afternoon market. The copper coins made a long 500 wen, which was 316,000 wen.</p>
<p>Also, the total number of silver yuan exchanged by the bill clearing house in this city on the 22nd was 4,631,397 yuan, 8 jiao, and 8 fen, including 2,888,833 yuan, 3 jiao, and 6 fen in silver yuan,</p>
<p>and 1,744,564 yuan, 5 jiao, and 2 fen in remittance silver yuan.</p>
<h3>A Small Rebound Discovered in Securities and Public Bonds</h3>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Securities Exchange, the public bonds rebounded slightly, and people's hearts showed slight</p>
<p>relief. Because the critical situation in Pingjin has not diminished, and the so-called new measures have not yet been realized, the short sellers in the market, after days of squeeze, have gradually become looser, and the long positions are relatively crowded, which is the result of the large amount of selling by No. 46 in the past few days. In the morning, the initial auction situation was still strong, and personnel reduction and troop disbandment, the 19th Customs, etc., all continued to rise by 3 or 4 jiao. Since the 19th, the situation gradually became less vigorous, and the long positions gradually came out, so they rebounded by 3 or 5 jiao, and the popularity was therefore lax. In the second auction, they all fell by 3 or 5 jiao, and the buying and selling was mainly long positions seeking to sell. In the afternoon, both long and short positions had swaps, and there were fewer new purchases and sales. The situation was still mainly long positions being weak, and both auctions saw a fall of several jiao. At the close, the salt tax also fell, and the market gradually showed signs of decline. As a result, it fell by several jiao to more than 1 yuan, and the future may still change. The total number of transactions was 15,852,000 yuan, including 17,000 yuan in spot goods. The futures were dominated by salt tax, accounting for 5,775,000, troop disbandment accounting for 2,930,000, 19th Customs accounting for 2,760,000, 20th Customs and 20th Issue accounting for 3,350,000, and the rest ranging from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands.</p>
<h3>New York Stocks Flat and Tired</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported that on Saturday (20th) in the New York stock market, although</p>
<p>railway freight increased by 7,276 vehicles, the prices fell by 1 or 2 yuan because of weak wheat and</p>
<p>long positions settling. Half-day transactions amounted to 1.3 million shares. Currently, the market price is close to last year's peak. The supply of stocks is gradually increasing. Recently, the number of gains has reached the end of its strength, and it seems difficult to continue to rise temporarily. However, business conditions are good, so there is no danger of a sudden drop at the same time. The situation in the future will probably not change significantly, because the market will go through a period of consolidation, which is also a natural trend. The Dow Jones index for Saturday is listed on the left:</p>
<p>Closing price Compared to the previous day</p>
<p>Thirty industrial stocks 80.12 Fell 1.54</p>
<p>Twenty railway stocks 37.47 Fell 0.99</p>
<p>Twenty utility stocks 27.40 Fell 0.48</p>
<p>Forty bonds 81.99 Fell 0.01</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: A Reaction Arises, and Marked Yarn Plunges</h3>
<p>The yarn market is trending weak, and the falling trend is quite intense. Because it has risen for many days in a row, a reaction has suddenly arisen, leading to a settlement of floating positions, and the market is becoming weaker. However, raw cotton is firm and rising, and large long positions are still unwilling to relax. The actual demand is clearer than yesterday, but the factory is unwilling to compromise on the yarn price because the raw materials are expensive. As for the reduction in labor, most of it is still in progress.</p>
<p>The human standard fell by as much as two yuan, six jiao. The human standard market opened in the previous market. With the trend of American cotton falling,</p>
<p>people's hearts were depressed, and there was a lack of buyers in the market. Long positions were settled, and each month fell by one</p>
<p>yuan, six jiao and nine points to two yuan. In the afternoon, it was heard that there were not many spot yarn transactions, and the situation</p>
<p>was still tired. Each month fell by five, six, and seven points. The total number of transactions for the day was 57,200 bales. It was found that Senkang sold 2,150 bales, Shenji 1,100 bales, Changfeng 1,500 bales, and Tongfu 800 bales. Yukang bought 2,350 bales, Gengfeng 1,500 bales, Jifeng 1,300 bales, Shenji 1,150 bales, Changfeng 2,300 bales, Dachang 1,200 bales, Chong'an 2,050 bales, and Yongchang 1,550 bales. The closing prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Human standard closing price increase and decrease account number August 1954 fell 26 59,200</p>
<p>May 1895 fell 26 19,050 September 1968 1944,700 June 196 26 47,350 October 1973 17 35,100 July 1932 27 62,600 Total 268,000</p>
<p>The consumption of spot yarn has deteriorated. The sales of spot yarn were clearer than yesterday. The statistics of the purchases of each gang for the whole day were 747 bales. The market fell by 5 jiao to one</p>
<p>yuan. The purchase amount of each gang is as follows:</p>

<h3>Marked Cotton Slightly Improved Before Closing</h3>
<p>The cotton market started to fall and then rose. However, American cotton has fallen continuously, and people's hearts are flat. The market atmosphere is</p>
<p>soft. However, some of them are because of the lack of current cotton inventory, so the industry's view of high</p>
<p>thinking has reached its peak. As soon as the market falls, there are many buyers. However, foreign cotton is flat and tired, which is inevitably unsatisfactory.</p>
<p>Zheng Standard started to fall and then returned. The Zheng Standard market opened in the previous market, and fell due to the downturn in American cotton. There were very few buyers in the market, and each month fell by three, four, and five jiao. The afternoon market opened with a tight situation, and the</p>
<p>surface was drier. At the close, it suddenly rose, and each month rose by two or three</p>
<p>jiao. The total number of transactions for the day was 75,300 dans. It was found that Mingde sold 2,300 dans, Shenchang 2,500 dans, Shenji 1,600 dans, Ruiyuan 1,900 dans, Yuanda 1,300 dans, and Yuanda 1,400 dans. Ruid bought 3,400 dans, Yongchang 1,400 dans, Xincheng 2,000 dans, Yukang 1,800 dans, and Dafeng 1,700 dans. The closing prices are as follows:</p>
<p>May 4600 fell 5 35,400 August 4580 fell 25 150,600</p>
<p>June 4600 05 110,200 October 4480 10 96,100</p>
<p>July 4590 10 145 700 Total 539,000</p>
<p>Raw cotton mills need to stop again. Spot cotton has stopped again due to the downturn in American cotton and the weakness of the yarn market. The source is estimated to be 520 bales of Yaohua.</p>
<h3>Grains</h3>
<p>Glutinous rice fell by one or two jiao</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Source 30-40. At first, the market still felt firm because of the cloudy weather.</p>
<p>After the weather turned clear, the situation became weak. For example, Sutongchang glutinous rice and Nangang thick rice and Xiliantang rice, which were all taken in by this street, the market price was cut by one or two jiao. The miserable bag still had a better taste than yesterday, with an amount of 2,000 several hundred bags. They are high-grade materials. Thin rice is all destined for Yantai and Weihaiwei, so the selection is strict. Medium-grade is immediately distinguished, and the buyer wants to cut it again. After the seller resisted, a stable situation was reached. Yanjian goods lack aroma, and the market price is also stable. Dujian followed glutinous rice and fell by a corner. The change of Yin and Yang met the supply and demand, and the market had no glory or disgrace.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday's source was about 27 or 8. The market was light,</p>
<p>and the medium-grade goods fell nearly a foot. Thin glutinous rice was set high, and the second was tired. Early rice price was smaller by a jiao. Yanjian Dujian was flat and straight. The port tip was tired. There were few transactions with customers. Yin Yuan lacked arrival, and Bai Yuan was fixed.</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice Transactions Were Booming and Continued to Rise by One Jiao</h3>
<p>The foreign rice market was quite pretty yesterday, because the Fuzhou gang had a very strong appetite.</p>
<p>In addition to running the Ke Xian smoothly, they were also very greedy for small twists.</p>
<p>And the foreign merchants still intended to reject it. As a result, Anli sold 500 bags, and Xiangmao sold 600 bags. The price was 6 yuan and 7 jiao to 7 yuan and 6 jiao. This price was one jiao higher than last week.</p>
<p>Ke Xian Minhua was also greedy, but because there were still many stocks and the source was endless, the</p>
<p>weather was hot, and the cargo owners were seeking to sell, so the market was only at a flat station. A total of 1,370 bags of Jiangxi rice and 1,464 bags of Hunan rice were offered throughout the day. Only Wen Taizhou took 370 bags of Jiangxi machine early rice, and the rest were taken by the Min gang. The market was not much different from last week.</p>
<h3>The Rise in Prices of Standard Flour Due to Rumors of Increased Taxes</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, after the flour market opened, various months showed signs of stagnation.</p>
<p>Prices for imported wheat declined slightly by one or two jiao, down to four or five jiao, causing opening prices to fall by five to seven and a half li compared to the previous week's closing. However, mills did not aggressively sell off their stock, and most adopted a wait-and-see approach. Outside buyers were also scarce due to the sunny weather. Consequently, trading was slow in various sectors. In the afternoon, however, market sentiment suddenly improved greatly. Rumors spread that import taxes on foreign flour would be increased, seemingly changing the position of domestic flour. Buying interest from both inside and outside the industry increased significantly, and market prices steadily rose. Nevertheless, such a development might be constrained by foreign flour. Even if there were talks of increasing taxes in Shanghai, concerns arose that the northern regions might oppose such measures, thereby cutting off a path to survival for domestic flour. As a result, the price for the current month rose by one fen and two and a half li compared to the previous week's closing price. June rose by one fen and seven and a half li, July rose by one fen and a half, August rose by one fen, September rose by one fen and a half, and October rose by one fen and two and a half li.</p>
<h3>Slight Discrepancies in Future Wheat Prices</h3>
<p>In the future wheat market, trading volume was weak for all months after the opening bell.</p>
<p>Due to favorable weather conditions and a slight decline in imported wheat prices by one, two, four, or five jiao, sentiment in all months was soft and hesitant. July, being the peak season for new crops, was particularly uncertain, falling by five fen compared to the previous week. August and September fell by one or two fen. Trading was initially stable in the afternoon, but improved after flour prices rose and rumors of increased taxes on foreign flour spread, causing sellers to tighten supply and buyers to show slightly increased interest. The market then showed a positive outlook. The current month, which had not been actively traded for some time, closed at four yuan and two jiao and a half. July fell by four fen, while August actually rose by two fen. September remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Soybean Oil and Bean Cakes Both Rise in Price</h3>
<p>丨丨 New Broad Beans Continue to Arrive in Quantities of One Hundred Bags 丨丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, soybean oil and bean cakes were both active. Soybean oil and raw oil were in tight supply due to sellers holding back, leading to price increases in jiao. Soybeans rose by three to four fen due to scarce supply and export procurement. Sentiment for bean cakes was optimistic, with buyers from the Wenzhou region inquiring about factory cakes and buyers from inland areas seeking customer cakes. As a result, prices rose by two fen in a single day. If the weather remained stable, the market could continue to rise. Two batches of new broad beans from Wenzhou arrived via the Haiyan vessel, consisting of seventy-three bags of small beans and thirty bags of large beans. Buyers from Zhangzhou were unable to catch up with the Jiang vessel, and other groups were not involved in trading, resulting in no purchases. The quality of this batch was said to be inferior to the first batch.</p>
<h3>The Silk, Tea, and Silkworm Cocoon Market: Assorted Details</h3>
<p>The early new cocoons from Hangzhou had slightly lower prices. Only one or two cocoon merchants in "Linping" were weighing cocoons because many of the delivered cocoons had poor skins, so merchants were not eager to buy.</p>
<p>Native cocoons were priced at 25 yuan (per 100 catties). Improved cocoons were priced between 28 yuan and 35 yuan. Very few cocoon merchants in "Gongbu" opened for business, and the arrived goods were also sparse. On the first day, cocoon prices were 26-27 yuan. On the second day, due to the poor quality of the cocoon shells, merchants refused to weigh and purchase them. Superior improved cocoons could be sold for 40 yuan, but the quantity was small.</p>
<p>The cocoons delivered to "Pingyao" were mostly native cocoons. The cocoon quality was thin and tender, and cocoon merchants weighed goods strictly, refusing to accept thin-skinned cocoons. Superior improved cocoons were priced at 35 yuan, and the quantity of arrived goods was limited.</p>
<p>The early and late silkworms in the Suzhou region were in poor condition. The early silkworms in the western countryside of "Shenyang" that were in their fourth sleep and consuming leaves vigorously had reduced leaf consumption and were constantly moving around. The late silkworms in the southern countryside that were in their third sleep were delayed in entering sleep. The silkworms in the eastern countryside that were in their third sleep and consuming leaves vigorously occasionally suffered from abdominal distension due to eating rain-soaked leaves. The early silkworms in "Nanjing" that were spinning cocoons on the frames spun silk intermittently and stopped making cocoons. The silkworms that were in their fourth sleep and consuming leaves vigorously were delayed in emerging from their sleep. The late silkworms were also not consuming leaves vigorously. The early silkworms in "Dantu" that had reached their fourth sleep and were consuming leaves vigorously suddenly experienced a sharp decrease in appetite. Some silkworm ants that were in their third leaf-releasing stage stopped moving and their bodies shrank, revealing white muscardine disease.</p>
<p>The Standardization Conference Sets Dry Cocoon Market Prices. The Silk Standardization Committee of Jiangsu and Zhejiang held a regular committee meeting and decided that the price of native cocoons would be 480 yuan per dan (unit of weight).</p>
<p>The price of improved cocoons was 550 yuan per dan. An investigation revealed that about 300 catties of fresh cocoons (regardless of native or improved varieties) could be dried into 100 catties of dry cocoons. If the breakdown of native dry cocoons for silk extraction was estimated to be 630-40 catties (i.e., extracting 100 catties of silk), then the price of fresh cocoons should only be 24-25 yuan per 100 catties. If the breakdown of improved dry cocoons was 500 catties for silk extraction, then fresh cocoons could be sold for 36-37 yuan.</p>
<p>There Was Still No Improvement in Sales of Artificial Silk. Merchants from Chang'an and Haining were taking delivery of 18 boxes of the current futures of Jin Qilin (Golden Unicorn) head No. 2 Red Fish brand.</p>
<p>The price ranged from 181 yuan, 2 jiao, 5 fen to 175 yuan net,</p>
<p>down by about one spot.</p>
<h3>The Sugar Market: Raw Granulated White Sugar Tries to Rise But Fails</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw little change in the gold standard exchange rate, leading to a slightly better trend. The guild raised the price of ordinary raw granulated white sugar for delivery by 1 jiao, to 20 yuan 5 jiao, but buyers only offered 4 jiao, resulting in no transactions. No. 20 medium granulated white sugar was 19 yuan 8 jiao 5 fen, and No. 8-9 Dutch red sugar was 16 yuan 6 jiao. Buyers showed little interest, and no deals were made. The Changxing Trading Company offered RA cotton Dutch white sugar at 21 yuan 7 jiao, but since the price was still high in the producing area, it could not be matched, so they tightened the price. They also offered Guanghua factory's Lu brand at 20 yuan 7 jiao 5 fen and Shou brand at 20 yuan 1 jiao 5 fen, milled sugar with a Guang package at 21 yuan, Zhenji No. 1 thread white sugar at 19 yuan 9, and Nos. 2, 3, 4, and 5 at the original prices. Taikoo car white sugar fell by 5 fen, with the B mark at 21 yuan 8 jiao 5 fen, later rising to 21 yuan 8 jiao. The other CW, DY, HX marks remained at the original prices. The Guangzhou-Shantou group offered 100 baskets of high-grade sliced green sugar at a price of 8 yuan 8 jiao, 94 packages of high-grade Zhuang cotton red sugar at a price of 15 yuan 8 jiao, and over 100 pieces of Hainan red sugar at 13 yuan 9 jiao, with a slight price increase. Chaoqing offered several hundred pieces, with high grades ranging from 12 yuan 8 jiao to 12 yuan 5 jiao 5 fen, and middle and lower grades ranging from 12 yuan 2 jiao to 11 yuan 4 jiao, varying considerably.</p>

<h3>Deception</h3>
<p>— Qifan</p>
<p>Deception can only work once or twice. Even the most foolish person will eventually refuse to be fooled repeatedly. Therefore, the most clever deception is when people do not realize they are being deceived and willingly fall for it.</p>
<p>However, it is necessary to discuss the meaning of the word "deception" here. Does deception have an absolute meaning? That is, if an event is deceptive, does everyone everywhere feel it is deceptive? For example, when a swindler cheats someone out of money, the victim, after losing their money, knows they have been deceived, and the swindler themselves knows they are cheating. That is not a problem. However, if a monk persuades people to believe in Buddhism, and the monk themselves truly believes in Buddhism and persuades good men and women to sincerely believe in Buddhism, then neither the monk nor the good men and women will feel it is deception. But from the perspective of a third person who does not believe in Buddhism, it is deception. However, this is not something to be afraid of. As long as the good men and women sincerely believe in Buddhism, even if the monk who persuades them to believe in Buddhism has doubts about Buddhism, they will not feel they have been deceived.</p>
<p>Therefore, the cause of deception lies solely in the lack of faith. With faith, even if it is actually deception, it becomes non-deception.</p>
<p>Therefore, the most clever deceivers must first create a kind of faith in people. With faith, deception can produce great power. The miracles of Jesus, such as raising the dead, healing lepers, restoring sight to the blind, and feeding thousands of people with a loaf of bread, are all produced by faith. In reality, they are deceptions, but people with faith will regard them as absolutely true.</p>
<p>Everything in the world is the same. The value of credit lies in this point. The reason why a store's signboard is valuable is because it has this effect. The greatest form of governance is also the same. Confucius was a political philosopher who had actually been involved in politics. He said that sufficient food, sufficient troops, and the trust of the people are essential. If it is absolutely necessary to give up one of these, he advocated giving up the troops first, then the food, saying that death has existed since ancient times, but a country cannot stand without the trust of the people. It can be seen that the way to govern a country is also to deceive the people wholeheartedly, and to pay attention to clever methods of deception.</p>
<p>The most clever swindler also has the means to deceive you so that you fully believe them, and even after you have been deceived, you still believe you have not been deceived. When others point it out to you and warn you, you will regard it as a lie. Such a skilled swindler is respectable, because the deceived person can experience less of the pain of realizing they have been deceived. Only the very stupid swindlers are hateful. They deceive people, and everyone knows they are deceiving, yet they shamelessly continue to use the same old tricks to deceive again. They do not understand at all the pain of people who realize they have been deceived but still cannot help but be deceived. The same is true of governing a country. If one can do as Confucius said and gain the faith of the people through deception, that is naturally the best. Otherwise, one should at least possess the skills of a clever swindler. It is hoped that those who wield political power throughout history, whether ancient or modern, Chinese or foreign, will not be stupid swindlers. As for those who believe they are sincere and passionate, but are still regarded as deceptive by others, that is the most ridiculous of all.</p>
<h3>Formal Logic ABC</h3>
<p>— Shuqian</p>
<p>In this era when formal logic is still regarded as a "magic weapon," and living in a country with a particular habit of applying formal logic, we cannot help but know some of the ABCs of formal logic.</p>
<p>Now, let's talk about what is called "hypothetical reasoning" in formal logic. For example, we say:</p>
<p>"Sugar is sweet." If we acknowledge that this proposition</p>
<p>is correct, then we must also acknowledge the proposition "If it is not sweet, then it is not sugar." However, we are not necessarily required to acknowledge the two propositions "If it is sweet, then it is sugar" and "If it is not sugar, then it is not sweet." Because the universe is vast, sweet things are not necessarily sugar; there may still be very sweet things other than sugar. This is the rule of "hypothetical reasoning."</p>
<p>But in our country, there are some special habits in the application of this rule.</p>
<p>For example, on the writing desk of a fortune teller, there are always three large characters written: "Sincerity brings efficacy." If we infer according to the rules of logic, it would be: "If it is not efficacious, then it is not sincere." That is to say, when fortune telling is not efficacious, it is because the person asking for the fortune telling is not sincere. This reasoning is not enough. We must also infer, according to the special customs of our country, the two propositions: "If it is not sincere, then it is not efficacious" and "If it is efficacious, then it is sincere."</p>
<p>Furthermore, when we acknowledge the proposition "Adversity builds a nation," we must, on the one hand, infer according to the rules: "If the nation does not prosper, then there is not much adversity."</p>
<p>At the same time, we must also infer, according to our customs, the two propositions: "If there is not much adversity, then the nation will not prosper" and "If the nation prospers, then there is much adversity."</p>
<p>Moreover, when someone says "If the enemy comes, I will definitely resist," we must naturally also infer, according to the rules, the proposition: "If I do not resist, then the enemy will not come." This reasoning alone is naturally not enough: we must also infer, according to customs, the two propositions: "If the enemy does not come, I will definitely not resist" and "If I definitely resist, then the enemy will come."</p>
<p>Most people probably know the logical rules mentioned above; as for the habits in application, perhaps everyone has not paid attention to them. Therefore, I have specifically brought them up here for the sake of practical application.</p>
<h3>Street Vendors</h3>
<p>— Luo Hong</p>
<p>Shouldering a lead bucket of hot zongzi (rice dumplings), he glanced at his despondent wife, then walked out of the low door of his home. At the end, he turned back and saw that his wife was still looking at him with a pair of pitiful, sick eyes. He swallowed, holding back a tear, and headed towards the alley entrance. For five years, the weariness on his wife's face, the sadness in her eyes, had grown heavier day by day. Now, she had been sick for several months, and she still had to make these zongzi every day. He himself would shoulder them out to sell every evening, returning home when the east was almost white, day after day, year after year, just to fill his stomach. He walked out of the alley entrance, turned the corner, and headed towards the road he walked every night. He met many nighttime vendors: those selling spiced tea eggs, those selling eight-treasure rice, those selling white sugar lotus seed porridge. All familiar faces, all with the same things to shoulder and carry.</p>
<p>They paid no attention to this chaotic and tiresome city. Those leaping, flying, and flashing lights, although surrounding them, seemed to them to be in another world, so far away. What use was it for them to look at them? They only hoped that those who could not afford to go to restaurants, the guests in small hotels, would do some business with them. After waiting long enough on the street, they would walk into those small alleys, drawing out their long voices, calling out their unchanging tunes. Sometimes sales were good, and they could earn a yuan or half a yuan in a night, but there were also many days of losing money. Living day by day was really like pulling a saw. Every night they shouldered their goods out to sell, but who knew if the money they earned would be enough to fill their stomachs the next day?</p>
<p>"White sugar::: lotus seed porridge-" His own voice stopped, and he heard Alin's low call. His own voice was not so clear, but Alin's sounded particularly mournful tonight, so he silently put down his lead bucket, squatted down, and waited.</p>
<p>"What's wrong?" Alin slowly walked over and asked him.</p>
<p>"No good. I've only sold four, and it's already past midnight," he sighed.</p>
<p>"What's the point of living so hard? The family is always hungry, and the debt is just growing. Hey, I just saw two places slaughtering pigs again. Living is unbearable. Why don't we become gangsters? I see it almost every night."</p>
<p>He looked at Alin's pointed chin and thought of his wife at home who had been sick for so long. They both sighed. The echoes of passing cars and the music from the radio drifted in the silence. Alin picked up his pole and walked away again. In the dim light, he watched the slowly moving black shadow and heard Alin draw out his long voice, calling out:</p>
<p>"White sugar::: lotus seed porridge." The voice sounded very mournful to him.</p>
<h3>A Performance Review of Wu Kui Bridge</h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>On the 20th of this month, Hong Shen's recent work, one of the trilogy, "Wu Kui Bridge," was performed by the Fudan Drama Society. This day happened to be the day of the Jiangwan horse races, and the traffic on Jiangji Road was particularly lively.</p>
<p>But the liveliness was on the side of the racetrack; in the Fudan Gymnasium, although some people gradually came, it was not until the opening whistle blew that they barely managed to fill a third of the seats.</p>
<p>At three o'clock, the curtain opened. The scenery and lighting were well coordinated, with a hint of a rural dawn atmosphere.</p>
<p>"Wu Kui Bridge" is a drama depicting rural life. In recent years, the rural economy has been increasingly collapsing, and conflicts between peasants and gentry landlords have erupted everywhere. Hong Shen seized upon a theme in these conflicts, accurately grasping the spirit of the times. "In this remaining night leading to dawn, in these hours of faint dawn leading to sunrise that determine the fate of Wu Kui Bridge, we can see the unfolding posture of the entire conflict between peasants and gentry. The gentry's desire to maintain their position and power and the various tricks they use to do so, and the actions of the peasants who are so oppressed that they have nowhere to go and finally burst forth." (From the final paragraph of the program notes). The actions of being oppressed to the point of having nowhere to go and finally bursting forth are indeed spreading rapidly like a "tiger train" in the countryside, although the period of "faint dawn" is still a bit early.</p>
<p>In this performance, Yuan Muzhi's portrayal of the Zhou gentry was excellent. Yu Qilin and Wu Tieyi's portrayals of the farmhands, Wu Huaibin's portrayal of Chen Jinfu, Hu Huizhong's portrayal of Mr. Xie, and Yang Shouwen's portrayal of Grandpa Wang were successful.</p>
<p>Da Bao's movements were stiff, Qiu Feng was a bit too artificial, and Li Quansheng played the role as if he were a worker. Moreover, it had to be a worker leader with knowledge in order to be so neurotic. In general, the director had too little experience of rural life, and portrayed the hardworking farmhands as grotesque figures with curved backs and twisted legs.</p>
<p>"The Taoist ritual scene was the best," said a spectator sitting next to me. After the entire play, the audience's emotions were not tense at all, which was the biggest flaw of "Wu Kui Bridge." When the emotions of the crowd were extremely intense, they suddenly calmed down, allowing Zhu Feng and Da Bao to have a leisurely conversation. The struggle had already begun, but because they had to wait for Qiu Feng's cry, the crowd had to stand there stiffly and foolishly. This scattered and fragmented the entire play! From this, we can learn a lesson: it is not appropriate to add digressions when performing a mass riot.</p>
<p>Other details, such as calling mud plasterers to repair the stone bridge, and a small river irrigating four or five hundred acres of land, were somewhat like building a cart behind closed doors, but those were very minor things that could be easily corrected.</p>
<h3>Correction</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the author of the article "Writing Books and Teaching," Mr. Yu Dafu,</p>
<p>was mistakenly listed as "Guo Dafu." We hereby correct this.</p>
<h3>Carrot Top</h3>
<p>— Written by Jules Renard, Translated by Lin Qu</p>
<p>Red Cheeks 1 (Continued)</p>
<p>Although these sounds are not loud, they are rather annoying because they continue incessantly. This invisible, moving whisper is like a mouse, constantly disturbing the silence in the room.</p>
<p>Monsieur Violon, dragging his old slippers, walked for a while among the rows of beds, scratching one foot, taking another's nightcap, and then stopping by Massol's bed, where he would talk to him late into the night every night. Normally, when the other students slowly pulled the covers up to cover their mouths, as if gradually stopping talking and falling asleep, this supervisor would still be leaning on Massol's bed, his elbows tightly resting on the iron bars, not even noticing that his arms were numb, as if many ants were crawling on his skin, all the way to his fingers.</p>
<p>He listened with great interest to his naive stories, and he said all sorts of intimate things to him, making him happy and forgetful of sleep. Later, he became very fond of him because he admired his gentle and beautiful face. The child's skin was extremely delicate, like a kind of pulp, and even under the slightest change in the air, one could see the fine veins scattered in the flesh, like the lines on a map placed under a piece of transparent paper. Moreover, Massol had a moving attitude that made people love him like a girl, which was the sudden blushing for no reason. Classmates often put their fingertips on his cheeks and suddenly retracted them, leaving a white mark on his face. After a while, this white mark would be covered by a beautiful red color, which quickly spread, like a drop of wine mixed in clear water, changing into many slightly different colors from the pale pink tip of his nose all the way to his purple ears. Everyone could go to his face and try it. Massol was willing to let others try it gently. Therefore, others gave him the nicknames night light, lantern, and red cheeks. This ability of his to provoke people at will aroused the envy of a group of people.</p>
<p>Carrot Top, who slept on the neighboring bed, was one of those who envied him. Carrot Top was a thin, lymphatic clown with a face covered with a layer of gray dust. Even if he tried his best to pinch his dry skin, he would not show any good-looking color. Moreover, his face was also occasionally marked with a few brown spots. He couldn't wait to use his fingernails to put some spots on Massol's red cheeks, or tear them open like orange peels.</p>
<p>Carrot Top, who had been ill-intentioned for a long time, listened carefully when Monsieur Violon approached Massol's bed that night. His suspicion might be justified. He wanted to know how the supervisor's sneaky attitude came about. He used all the abilities of a small spy. He ridiculously pretended to snore, turned his body over as if something important was happening, and let out a sharp cry like a nightmare, waking everyone in the dormitory and causing all the blankets to move like waves. Then, when Monsieur Violon walked away, he stretched half his body out of bed and said to Massol anxiously:</p>
<p>"Rabbit! Rabbit!"</p>
<p>The other person did not answer a word. Carrot Top knelt up, grabbed Massol's arm, and shook it hard:</p>
<p>"Did you hear me! Rabbit!"</p>
<p>The rabbit seemed not to have heard: Carrot Top became angry and said again:</p>
<p>"He kissed you! Now it's clean!::: You thought I didn't see you. Tell me, didn't he kiss you! Tell me, aren't you a rabbit!"</p>
<p>He stood up, stretched his neck, like a threatened male goose, and held his fists tightly by the bed.</p>

<h3>Edicts of Self-Reproach</h3>
<p>— Tianfang</p>
<p>Ancient emperors were all wise and enlightened. When faced with floods, droughts, disasters, or foreign invasions, and the common people were restless and unable to live in peace, they would generously issue edicts of self-reproach. Generally, they would say things like "This unworthy self has lost virtue and burdened the common people" or "All the sins of the world are on my shoulders," condemning themselves and announcing to the world that they were responsible. It had the spirit that all the sins of the world should be borne by them. As a result, the restless common people returned to peace, praising the emperor for ten thousand years and being mindful of the people's suffering. Although in fact it was "all the world" that suffered, had not the emperor already repented for them? This gratitude alone was worth being at peace with.</p>
<p>For four thousand years, although the emperors have been replaced, from "I alone" to committee members, this state of mind has been passed down to the present without ever being lost.</p>
<p>A modern elder statesman said, "In the Sino-Japanese War of 1894, China was defeated. At that time, we should have strived to strengthen ourselves. However, after 1894, although we learned a lesson, we still failed to strive to strengthen ourselves. This sin should be borne by the older generation. Because at the time of the Sino-Japanese War, Chairman XX was only seven years old. At that time, I was already thirty-one years old. XX, being young at that time, naturally did not remember. We who were older and remembered it should have advocated and awakened the people of the country to strengthen ourselves long ago. But I failed to advocate, and the sin is inescapable."</p>
<p>These words were spoken in a gentle and moving way, like a woman who has been abandoned telling her grievances. You cannot help but feel a sense of numbness, and a burst of inexplicable grief disappears. Because the children at that time do not have to bear the current responsibility, and even less so the younger generation forty years later. The history of national disasters is so long, and this debt must be settled with the Aisin Gioro clan. The reason is far away in Guanwai. Although there are not many older people who are responsible, they are not as hard to find as those over a hundred years old. Let them be responsible.</p>
<p>We can't do anything about the past, and we don't have to do anything about the present. But when it comes to the responsibility of failing to "advocate" forty years from now, I am afraid that the sin will be inescapable. But it doesn't matter, we can tell the younger generations that we were already identified by the previous generation of gentlemen as having "no political knowledge," and this can also be used as an excuse. Just read the words of the current elder statesman carefully, and when the time comes, issue an "edict of self-reproach" as usual.</p>
<h3>Childhood Aspirations</h3>
<p>— Bei</p>
<p>I grew up in such a family.</p>
<p>My father often said that at the beginning of my grandfather's establishment of the family, he only</p>
<p>received four "dan" of unhusked rice from his grandfather. Relying on hard work,</p>
<p>and frugal small business practices, he not only supported his family, but also gradually became moderately wealthy. Although he could only be considered a third or fourth-class family in the town, he was the only wealthy family in our small clan.</p>
<p>In my hometown, shrouded in feudal forces, even now there are still</p>
<p>corrupt gentry and local bullies who suck the blood and sweat of the common people. At that time, my grandfather was an illiterate man of action, who suffered many losses in vain, and was so angry that tears streamed down his face. He gritted his teeth and determined that his descendants should study. My father spent his whole life writing eight-legged essays, and indeed, he greatly upheld the family reputation. By our generation, my eldest brother failed in his studies, and my second, third, and fourth brothers all turned to manual labor. Unexpectedly, my father placed so much hope on me. He often said, "Passing on virtue to future generations is best done through good deeds, but reviving the family reputation still requires studying." My father's purpose in insisting that I study was naturally to revive the family reputation. I can guarantee that the motivation of getting promoted and becoming rich was minimal. But at that time, I was unwilling to study no matter what, and I would rather sneak out of the shady</p>

<p>school and, barefoot, follow my fourth brother to the mountains to cut grass and herd cattle.</p>
<p>One day, my uncle said to me, "I calculated</p>
<p>your "ba zi" (eight characters), and it shows you have a very good destiny for studying. You won't achieve anything doing other things." I don't know if he really calculated it that way, or if my father instigated him to say this to me specifically. Children are, after all, most susceptible to flattery. Seeing my uncle speak with such relish, I began to aspire to study. From then on, I put aside my beloved work of cutting grass and herding cattle, and buried my head in studying "The Analects" and "The Book of Poetry," although all I saw in the books were white paper and black characters, and I didn't understand the meaning at all.</p>
<p>Entering high school was like going to a foreign school.</p>
<p>The books we read were much simpler than those in private school, and I gradually found some interest in them. Without any guidance, I also loved to read things like "Student Literary Series" and "New Library" in my spare time; sometimes I also liked to browse old antiques, dragging out my voice to chant them after dinner and before bed, looking just like a little scholar.</p>
<p>When I reached the second grade, I developed an interest in reading newspapers.</p>
<p>Every time I went home, my father would humbly ask questions, and the local hypocrites would gather around, listening with fascination. I would start to explain in a torrent of words, saying how the country was divided into several factions, and who was strong and who was weak. When school let out for the summer and I went back to the countryside, fearing that I wouldn't have newspapers to read, I specially invited a classmate. We each contributed 1,000 "wen" (currency) to subscribe to a popular small newspaper from the provincial capital for two months. I remember that even though it was such a small newspaper, it also had a supplement, which I loved to read the most. I secretly aspired that, in the future, once I had achieved scholarly success, even if I didn't have anything to do, I could live in a city and live a life of submitting articles, wouldn't that be refined and carefree?</p>
<p>Who knew that ten years later, today, I would actually crawl into</p>
<p>this mess of a trap, burying my head in realizing my childhood aspirations.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, I really feel endless fatigue and boredom</p>
<p>because I have to write, racking my brains, in order to make a living, regardless of whether the content is substantial or beneficial to society and the public, only hoping for a bountiful output, only hoping for the favor of the editor, so that if I submit an article, it will be published, and I wish I could do all the writing in the whole publication myself.</p>
<p>Because I feel endless fatigue and boredom, I really want to break free; but before breaking free, I also want to take pride in this. Many friends write to ask me what I am doing in Shanghai? My reply is: "Earning a living by writing." Sometimes I feel that this is not grand enough, so I want to exaggerate even more, saying: "Engaged in cultural movement in Shanghai." How unwilling I am to say this! But after all, it came out of my mouth.</p>
<p>I remember that last year this publication published an article by Cangping,</p>
<p>entitled "The Awkward Literati," which began with something like these sentences: "Unable to carry on the shoulder, unable to lift with the hand, and unable to make a living by trading, this is the overall reason for the awkwardness of literati.</p>
<p>"Yes, being awkward for oneself is not a big deal. What I am</p>
<p>most worried about is still the "empty talk," going back and forth, without producing anything at all. What benefit is there to society and the public?</p>
<p>I think there will be a day when I break free from my current life, which is what I aspired to in my childhood. I am preparing for new aspirations, more meaningful new aspirations.</p>
<h3>A Sigh of Relief</h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>Having exhausted a tremendous amount of effort, squeezed out a lot of</p>
<p>brainpower, and spent countless efforts, during the spare time from work,</p>
<p>I finished writing several manuscripts in my spare time and hurriedly threw them into the mailbox, eagerly hoping to be accepted. However, every day I flipped through the newspaper, carefully looking from beginning to end, but I never saw my humble work published, which made me extremely disappointed, and I unconsciously sighed a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>I paid the price of ten stamps to get a copy of the regulations</p>
<p>of XX University, and after reading the contents carefully, I estimated that the expenses for one semester would be at least more than one hundred yuan. How could a poor person like me afford so much tuition? I had to sigh a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>Under the fierce sunlight, I was busy all day long,</p>
<p>running countless roads, enduring countless ridicules, to visit some old classmates or teachers, wanting to find a basic position. Either I was blocked and scolded by the gatekeeper, or I got a reply of "wanting to help but lacking the ability." At this point, I took another breath of cold air.</p>
<p>Opening the map and looking at it, the northern territory is shrinking</p>
<p>day by day. Yesterday it was said that we retreated to Location A, today it is too</p>
<p>[incomplete text] to Location B, fearing that we will become the second Korea, and I couldn't help but sigh again.</p>
<h3>The Story of Zha Xian</h3>
<p>— Lingling</p>
<p>It was a summer evening. Although the weather wasn't very</p>
<p>cool, but because the summer rain had just passed, people</p>
<p>indeed felt relatively happy in their bodies and minds.</p>
<p>In the western end of a small town, next to the school,</p>
<p>in a Guanyin Hall (temple) brightly lit by kerosene lamps, people, ah: men, women, old, and young, crowded the room. Originally a quiet and lonely Guanyin Hall, it was suddenly so lively that I couldn't help but be suspicious. So, with curiosity aroused, I made a pilgrimage to the Guanyin Hall.</p>
<p>It turned out that a middle-aged woman, pretending to be the voice of various people,</p>
<p>was already performing "Zha Xian"! (Zha Xian is a superstitious practice in the countryside. Villagers who want to know the situation of their ancestors after death often ask an old female witch to perform Zha Xian.) She was saying things like so-and-so's grandfather is already facing Yin officials (underworld court)! How is so-and-so's mother doing! Although there were many listeners, there was no sound at all. The order was so good that it was definitely not something that human power could achieve. Here, I have to admire the greatness of the power of superstition.</p>
<p>This "Zha Xian" movement, which the villagers called reasonable and fully believed in, did not end until 11 p.m. It is said that the old witch had a total income of six or seven yuan in two or three hours, and XX places had already made reservations. From Qingming Festival to now, she has had a total income of six or seven hundred yuan. Alas: I, who am engaged in a chalk-dust career, am really ashamed of myself!</p>
<p>Alas: This kind of superstitious thing is now spreading in the countryside. Farmers are suffering from unstable lives and being oppressed too much in the countryside. They want to use the power of their ancestors in the underworld to help them a little. Therefore, the superstitious thing of Zha Xian appears. Although the action is extremely stupid, and the sadness of their hearts is unspeakable, we really can't bear to blame them excessively.</p>
<p>However, at this moment when we are advocating rural revitalization, there are still such strange phenomena in the countryside. Whose fault is this after all?</p>
<h3>Scars of Revolution</h3>
<p>— Bei</p>
<p>Because I wrote "Childhood Aspirations," it triggered my memories of this period of life. Although it can't be said that it's the fault of childhood aspirations, it's still the awkwardness of a literati. It will always</p>
<p>occupy a corner of my mind, it will always be a scar on my little life.</p>
<p>The fact started in the winter of the year before last, in October.</p>
<p>Thinking about it, although I knew at the beginning that it was not a way out, nor a proper way of life, I never even dreamed that the reality would be so difficult, ferocious, and cruel that I almost can't believe it when I recall it now.</p>
<p>Fate has determined the value of the poor. After all, I did not enjoy the happiness of higher education. One dawn in the early autumn of the year before last, we were forcibly pressed onto freight cars by a large number of soldiers and police, and transported to Tiantong'an to be dismissed. The school also rang the death knell. From then on, I became like a fledgling bird that had lost its flock, and began a struggle against hunger. Unable to struggle, I went to several hotels and organizations to visit strangers I had never met. Under the ferocious faces of those strangers, I fantasized about many brilliant dreams, "A scholar is used by those who understand him." I only hoped that it didn't have to be through "genital relations" or "friendship through generations" to be able to play a wriggling role on the road of life.</p>
<p>It was in this consciousness and situation that I stepped onto</p>
<p>the fourth floor of a bank on the towering Bund (a famous street in Shanghai), to visit the main character of this memory.</p>
<p>I was excited as if I had been injected with morphine, and rejoiced like a big shot who had won champagne, at the prospect of exchanging food and lodging for a secretarial position with a scheduled one or two hours of work per evening, and later a subsidy of twelve yuan a month, only saying that I would be adding a little editing work during the day. My friends also congratulated me.</p>
<p>Because of this, I became used as a "panacea." For example, when it came to writing letters, from drafting to copying, sometimes I even had to take them to mail. The various levels of duties used by secretaries and clerks became my complex value. Fortunately, my employer had both a "niangyi" (female servant) and a chauffeur, and had not yet given birth to a "xiao nai" (concubine's child), otherwise I might have had to take on the responsibilities of pulling a rickshaw, cooking, and taking care of children.</p>
<p>The employer saw that I was such a great talent, and it was a pity that most of my time was wasted on copying. So,</p>
<p>he wanted me to also do the work of the young mistress, the granddaughter of some</p>
<p>[incomplete text]. However, how could the young mistress write, and how would she be willing to write? Didn't she still want me to work overtime late at night?</p>
<p>Even I myself was a little doubtful. How could I endure until the emergency situation of "January 28th" (a reference to the Shanghai Incident in 1932)? By this time, I had already edited two books for him, so even though the situation was so frightening, he still couldn't bring himself to let me go. But I had no place to stay, and he was so kind as to rent the garret to refugees fleeing from the war zone for twenty-five yuan a month, telling me to set up a temporary bed in the corner of the reception hall at night.</p>
<p>Not only did he occupy my body, but he also captured my soul. Although he was very satisfied with my work, the reflection of me in his eyes was clearly a soulless slave. He had not a trace of true feeling for me, only a forced smile when he saw that my work</p>
<p>was satisfactory. Sometimes, when I went out for a while on business, he would glare at me and make some sarcastic remarks. There was always work to be ordered even on Sundays.</p>
<p>As expected, the niangyi and the chauffeur also looked down on me. If I went to get tea myself, I would often be turned away. I</p>
<p>had a friend visit me once, and it was clear that I was at home, but they were too lazy to open the door and dismissed him. From then on, my friends stopped coming, and I didn't dare to invite them again.</p>
<p>I had drafted several telegrams for him, which he grandly published in the newspaper. Exhausting all the ideas I could, he allowed me to go home to visit my family, but as soon as I returned, he sent letters and telegrams urging me, saying that he had found a way out for me. I, who was down on my luck, fell into his trap, and after stepping into his golden gate for the second time, I actually received a monthly salary of thirty-two yuan, but I finally made the desperate move to escape.</p>
<p>I believe that in Shanghai there are many employers</p>
<p>and employees of this type. These employers are mostly high-class Chinese, and they are also the pillars of Shanghai. And the employees are we awkward literati of this kind.</p>
<p>It has been a year since I escaped, and I see with my own eyes that the times are already digging graves for these employers. I also hope that there will finally be a day when the scar on my life is washed away.</p>

<p>Introducing the sole agency for new medical books and newspapers: New Medicine Publishing</p>
<p>The number of new Chinese medicine publications has gradually increased in recent years, but it is a pity that there is no central place, which has led to insufficient development. The Shanghai Wu Ding Company, in view of this, has specially added a medical book and newspaper department this year, which fully subscribes to and sells all Chinese medical books and newspapers, and is immediately preparing to classify and compile the "National New Medicine Book and Newspaper Catalog." It has now been published. If you need to read it, please send a letter to the Medical Book and Newspaper Department, Wu Ding Company, No. 266 Beijing Road, Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Where is Our Way Out?</h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>I, an ignorant person, am also nineteen years old this year. Due to poverty, I only studied in junior high school for one year before dropping out. How unwilling I am, but the fact is that I was not allowed to continue studying. I also wanted to be independent early, perhaps to reduce the burden on my father. But now I have been here for almost three years, and I ask myself, what have I learned? Seeing my father getting older year by year, and his burden is still so heavy, how can I not be anxious? Moreover, the future of my career is so dark, without any hope, secretly adding a layer of sadness to my anxiety. Sir, what should I do? Perhaps I am not the only one like this? I am afraid that all young people have this nameless sadness. "Where is our way out?" This question is generally good in the hearts of young people in the sea. Sir, I am afraid you will say that I am too unmotivated to move forward,</p>
<p>a useless young man, right? However,</p>
<p>Sir, the ruthless society has given me so much</p>
<p>disappointment. Everything, everything, fully shows snobbery. Human feelings are as thin as paper, and the exploitation and oppression of capitalists are unscrupulous. Ah! This society! This snobbish society! It is too disappointing to people, especially us young people. Therefore, I now yearn for studying very much, because on the other hand, I feel even more the lack of knowledge. I am often panicking. My monthly income is only eight old foreign dollars. I keep one dollar for myself, and the rest is all brought home. How can this intellectual famine be relieved? Undoubtedly, I am hesitating!</p>
<p>Sir, please guide me, don't let me hesitate on the wrong path! Sincerely</p>
<p>Yours respectfully, Jin Songxing</p>
<p>X X X X</p>
<p>Editor's note: In this evil society, not only</p>
<p>young people, but everyone will feel a vague future and shout "Where is our way out?"</p>
<p>"Is there really no way out for us</p>
<p>? There is, but we need to open it up ourselves. Now it is full of thorns and obstacles!</p>
<p>Our efforts, in the active aspect, of course</p>
<p>are to transform society. How to prevent snobbery and human feelings. How to deal with capitalist exploitation. Pooling our strength and uniting and fighting to seek the light of the whole society. In the passive aspect: we should seek to adapt to society within our ability, under the condition of "not being assimilated by the evil society." Increasing our knowledge is of course the only way to adapt to society. However, sometimes, it may already be beyond our ability: for example, continuing to study, reading widely, and calling Mr. Jin, who only earns eight dollars a month,</p>
<p>it is impossible. So, we think that even this level does not have to be forced. Like Mr. Jin's situation, since he has no money to go to school to study, and no money to buy books, then you only need to fully use the opportunities, such as the free circulation library of this newspaper, and the newspapers originally subscribed to by the company, etc. There are many knowledgeable people in the world whose knowledge comes entirely from libraries and newspapers! When fighting, of course it will be more difficult to use effort; but after success, it is the same. Besides knowledge, there are many directions to strive for in adapting to society. There are many successful great people in the world who do not rely on knowledge!</p>
<p>Our way out is for us to open up ourselves.</p>
<p>Transforming society to seek a solution for the masses, and at the same time can solve ourselves among the masses. Transforming ourselves to seek to adapt to society.</p>

<h3>The Life of the Five Consorts (15) (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Fourteen: First Love</p>
<p>That night, Miss Liu simply couldn't sleep. Of course, accompanying Manager Gu at the dance hall and drinking a few more glasses of champagne was</p>
<p>one reason. Afterwards, Manager Gu insisted on sending her back in an affectionate way, and she inevitably smoked a few more puffs of opium with him, which naturally made her even more excited. Fortunately, she said a lot of good words to comfort Manager Gu and send him back, which was considered sparing her one night. However, in the end, she didn't fall asleep, and she kept tossing and turning and sighing all night. That night, Zhang Wenbin's shadow simply haunted her memory like a ghost, which was really annoying. Afterwards, she didn't know why, but she suddenly felt very uneasy, and even felt ashamed: the main thing was that she shouldn't have refused to let him go to the theater with her, but instead sneaked around with Manager Gu behind his back. But why did she suddenly become so kind-hearted? Even she herself thought it was ridiculous, as if she was possessed by a ghost.</p>
<p>The next day, when the faint white light appeared on the window curtains, she remembered having slept for a while, but she woke up again soon after. She coughed for a while, and her head felt swollen and painful. She called to He Xiang and said:</p>
<p>"Didn't you say that the one surnamed Zhang had sent a photo to Ma?"</p>
<p>"Which one surnamed Zhang?"</p>
<p>"Isn't it the one who came yesterday."</p>
<p>"Ah! This one surnamed Zhang, yes, yes.</p>
<p>And soon she took a photo from He Xiang's hand and immediately recognized the lively young man from yesterday.</p>
<p>But after looking at it for a long time, it was still just a photo. At this time, she moved the telephone and decided to allow Zhang Wenbin to</p>
<p>come again to see her. Afterwards, she instructed He Xiang and said,</p>

<h3>Three Weeks of Hellish Work (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Yi Fan</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Arduous Life of an Actor: A Self-Account by Kim Hackshaw of an Event from Ten Years Ago</p>
<p>In "The Devil's Golf Course," I had to perform a scene of "Catching the Donkey." Because, according to the plot, the donkey's back was carrying a water</p>
<p>jug, and the water inside was our only lifeline, I had to perform the scene of not being able to catch the donkey, so I had to shoot it, but that shot just happened to hit the water jug. The weather was really hot, and I performed it for ten days in a row. In the cool place during the day, it was a full one hundred and sixty degrees. At night, the coolest time, it was also ninety-seven degrees. The wind blowing up was like a raging fire. We had to use large cars to surround it, and cover the four sides with thick tarpaulins, otherwise, the hot wind blowing on people would make people wither and die. I lived in this place for four weeks, and never had a water bath, nor changed my clothes. Every day, many people only had an average of three gallons of water to drink. When performing, because the weather was hot and dry, sweat would dry as soon as it came out, so water was poured on the body and it would dry as soon as it came out. So, Von Stroheim ordered oil to be poured on the body. Originally, when pouring water, it was like being in boiling water, but later, when oil was poured on the body, and burned by the sun at one hundred and sixty or seventy degrees, the body was like being in an oil pot, and the skin was scorched. Later, that donkey was actually sun-dried to death. But Von Stroheim was still not satisfied. We couldn't figure out what his intentions were.</p>
<p>The last scene of "Greed" was to be shot at "The Devil's Golf Course." That place was full of rock salt, and jagged stalagmites, as sharp as blades. Coran and I fought hand-to-hand there. Our clothes were torn into strips, and we were beaten with bruises all over our bodies, with bloodstains everywhere. In addition, the rock salt seeped into the skin, and the pain was like being cut with a knife. Von Stroheim still thought it was not fierce enough, and roared from the side: "It's terrible! Do it again! When you fight, just think of fighting me, that might make you more excited!" Really, we all hated Von Stroheim with a passion, and he knew it himself. So we really fought desperately, but Von Stroheim always thought it didn't taste good enough, and wanted us to repeat it once or twice, almost making me really crazy. Fortunately, among the whole team, only Von Stroheim carried a gun. At that time, I suddenly jumped up empty-handed and pounced on Von Stroheim, shouting "I'll kill you, you::". Von Stroheim took a step back, pulled out his gun and shouted wildly "I'm going to shoot!" Thank goodness a lamp technician hit me on the head and knocked me unconscious to the ground. Otherwise, Von Stroheim's gun would have shot me to death!</p>
<p>Fortunately, three weeks have passed. Only three or four people were left in the team, and the rest had either contracted sunstroke and had been transported away. At that time, we were all inhuman, and the world believed that we had all been wiped out and died in Death Valley, and the newspapers had printed it like this. When I returned to the world, my wife didn't recognize me anymore. I was so weak that I couldn't even stand up straight, and my whole body was in pain. From head to toe, there was no place that wasn't injured. Later, after recuperating for four weeks, I managed to escape from the hands of the god of death.</p>
<p>But we filmed hundreds of thousands of feet of film before and after, and Von Stroheim cut them all out, leaving a few thousand feet. On the screen, it was only shown for ten minutes. This is the section about Death Valley in "Greed." But who among the audience watching the movie knows the hardships at that time? (The End)</p>
<h3>Film Review: Review of "Honeymoon Trip"</h3>
<p>— Xing</p>
<p>Looking at the title of this film, it seems to be full of sweet</p>
<p>love, but in fact it is not so. The film is entirely about the petty thieves' coveting and lusting after "profit." Although it doesn't talk about rectifying social mores, it is much better than unconscious love films. What I saw was produced by the British branch of RKO Pictures. This is the third time, and relatively speaking, it is not disappointing, which shows that the United Kingdom is indeed making progress in the field of film day by day.</p>
<p>Let me introduce the plot of this "Honeymoon Trip" first.</p>
<p>A newlywed couple goes to Scotland for their honeymoon.</p>
<p>The husband has a new invention about electrical engineering, which arouses the ambition of a gang of thieves who plan to take the blueprint of the new invention as their own. They lure the husband out and imprison him, and then force his wife to hand over the blueprint, so that they can take the drawing and flee. When they arrive at their home in London, the good husband just happens to escape from the thieves' den. Unexpectedly, the thieves come again and use a pistol to force them, but fortunately the police arrive and the thieves are captured.</p>
<p>The consciousness is shallow, but there are many mistakes when it is shown. How did the thieves know the blueprint? Why didn't the thieves use force in Scotland? These and other things were not explained clearly at all. However, the director's cleverness is still good. The direct narrative plot, without flashbacks, can create unexpected twists and turns, deliberately making strange strokes, and calling the audience suddenly nervous, which is indeed not bad. The scenery has local characteristics, which is quite realistic. The lighting can generally be said to be "good." The photography has several close-up exterior shots that are worth watching, and the movements are also very agile, but most of the highlights are the editing of the scenes, which help to make it. There is not too much dialogue. People who don't understand English can also not feel dry.</p>
<p>In terms of performance, it is extremely humorous. The war-heavy drama</p>
<p>is performed with a serious attitude, but it can make the onlookers unable to help but laugh. Of course, relatively speaking, the female lead (who plays the virtuous wife) Benita Hume is the best. Not only are the close-ups of her inner expressions very beautiful, but she is also good at cooperating with others. Most of the vividness of the whole film is due to her. Secondly, Harold Huth, who plays the gangster, is also very good, making people pity him and hate him at the same time. It's not an easy thing for a supporting villain to actually surpass the male lead, right? The male lead Peter Hennen doesn't talk about any advantages or disadvantages. The rest don't need to be mentioned, but the average performance is not too bad. Although some actors cannot add to the vividness, there are no major flaws.</p>
<h3>Review of "Iron Steed"</h3>
<p>— Yan Nan</p>
<p>Why aren't martial arts films valued? Many people probably doubt this question, but if you watch a few martial arts films, you will naturally find the answer. Almost all of these films have the same content, except for a few martial arts films made by Fan Mingke, which can be considered exceptions. Let's look at those ordinary martial arts films. Which one doesn't depict a martial artist encountering injustice, helping people fight, and finally winning the favor of a beauty, resulting in a happy ending? No matter what is interspersed or how complicated the story is, they are largely the same, actually "old wine in new bottles."</p>
<p>With the change of style by Fan Pengke and the retirement of Tom Mix, George O'Brien had a good opportunity to become the leader of martial arts stars. SMKOKELIGHTING's "Iron Steed," George's so-called new work, was actually filmed as early as 1930, but some reshoots and modifications were recently added.</p>
<p>The story is, of course, similar to what I said above, doing its best to promote the ideals of heroes and beauties, so I won't write much about it. What else is there to say besides evil not prevailing over good and heroes struggling to succeed (?)? Perhaps what's more worth watching is the technique?</p>
<p>George O'Brien is the protagonist, of course, and the great hero at the center of the film. We have long been familiar with his martial arts skills. He is agile, brave, and lively, showing his whole body of martial arts. If this film does not use camera trickery to deceive the audience, then George's scenes, such as climbing onto trains from horseback, are indeed very precious and rare. The horse riding scenes in this film are particularly brilliant. Neil O'Day's performance as his lover is also very delicate. Betsy Ringross, who plays the rescued woman, is petite and lovely, but also a bit over the top. The person playing the police officer perfectly portrays the identity of "cops as robbers." The so-called bandits are too ridiculous, just "useless eaters," certainly not the hero's opponents. Although using these sidekicks can highlight George's agility, it greatly detracts from the film.</p>
<p>The outdoor scenery is ordinary, and the sets are few, but they are passable. As for the cinematography, many shots must have taken great effort to capture, which can be described as "enhancing the film." The lighting is average. The director has made some special contributions, mostly minor, so it is not convenient to elaborate. The fact that the hero does not wait longer to unite with the rescued girl but instead reunites with his lover seems to be a slight departure from convention. (Whether the rescued girl is an adult or a child is also a detail considered by the screenwriter).</p>
<p>In short, if you want to see a great hero who can defeat ten thousand enemies, annihilate bandits, and bring joy to the people, then this film is a good choice.</p>
<p>Audience Opinion</p>
<h3>My Review of "Awakening"</h3>
<p>— Meng Gan</p>
<p>The story is extremely illogical, but the expressions are acceptable.</p>
<p>Because I felt the significance of the word "Awakening," I thought it couldn't be too bad. Moreover, it was specially praised by the Film Censorship Committees of the Ministry of Interior and Education, so I thought it must be an excellent work. Therefore, I felt I absolutely had to see it. But it was better not to see it. After watching it, I was absolutely disappointed.</p>
<p>"Awakening" tells the story of a young man who loved a village girl, but was also seduced by a modern woman. He abandoned the village girl, and later the young man was abandoned by the modern woman. In this situation, both protagonists became awakened. I think this kind of awakening is just some ripples in personal life. It could be titled "Turning Back is the Shore," but it's not worthy of the big sign of "Awakening"!</p>
<p>As for the story, insertions are forced and the cleverness does not conform to reality. In many places, attempts at cleverness backfire. Also, the actors' movements are too fast, and the sentence arrangements are inconsistent, so this film is disappointing. Regarding expressions, they are pretty good. The actors all have realistic and natural expressions, with Fan Xuepeng being the best. So they have some success in this area. As for the director, he has no new techniques, just average.</p>
<h3>Wheeler and Woolsey Imitate Women</h3>
<p>— Luo Fen</p>
<p>Since Marlene Dietrich started wearing men's clothing in Hollywood, many stars like Anna Sten have followed suit, wearing men's clothes. As a result, men's clothing in Hollywood clothing stores sold out, while women's clothing sales decreased dramatically. Before coming to Shanghai, the two comedic friends Wheeler and Woolsey went to comfort the owners of the clothing stores in Hollywood, telling them not to worry. The two of them went to clothing stores and bought two sets of women's clothing and wore them. The short skirts stopped at the knees. The two walked hand in hand on the streets of Hollywood, saying they were promoting the wearing of women's clothing for men. Many people, like followers of Marlene Dietrich, followed the two of them taking pictures. But after Wheeler and Woolsey promoted this for two days in Hollywood, no men were willing to imitate them. Later, the two of them set off for Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Sternberg in London</h3>
<p>— Bing</p>
<p>After achieving fame and fortune, one can leisurely wander through the scenery.</p>
<p>Famous director Josef von Sternberg left Hollywood after his contract with Paramount expired at the end of last year. Initially, he roamed India, and then returned to Europe, staying in his German hometown for several months. Now he has left Germany and gone to England. According to a London telegram, Sternberg has safely arrived in London.</p>
<p>Sternberg saved a lot of wealth in Hollywood, especially the income he received when directing Dietrich. Now he is famous and wealthy, so he can go to Europe for a long trip. During his [unclear character] , he collected many modern sculptures, oil paintings, etc. He is a person who makes a living through art, so he naturally loves everything artistic. Now in London, he is still trying to collect sculptures and oil paintings to supplement what he collected in California. According to a Reuters telegram, Sternberg told reporters in London: "I have been in the film industry for twenty years. Now I plan to take a long rest, but I will not abandon film life. I will travel around the world, and if I can improve artistically through observation, I will return to the film industry and continue my unfinished aspirations."</p>

<h3>The Half-Life of Pola Negri</h3>
<p>— Wang Guan Hong</p>
<p>Former movie queen Pola Negri was born on January 3, 1897, in Bromberg, Poland. Her early education was in Warsaw. Later, because her family wanted her to become an actress, she entered a drama school in Warsaw at the age of seventeen. It usually took three years to graduate, but her talent was extraordinary. In just a year and a half, she had completed all the courses and was about to graduate. After graduation, she appeared on the red carpet in Warsaw until the outbreak of the European War, when she left Poland. Soon, she joined the film industry, not only as the lead actress but also writing and directing a film herself. After that, she starred in the famous "Passion." When the film was released in the United States, it was praised by American audiences. Soon, she went to the United States and made many famous works for the American film industry, gaining even more reputation. She was once selected as the movie queen. She left the film industry several years ago. Now, her first talking picture is "Woman Commands" at New Light Studios.</p>

<h3>Film Novel "The White Sister" (7)</h3>
<p>— Si Ping</p>
<p>MGM Production Starring Helen Hayes: Sacrificing Reputation and Happiness for Love</p>
<p>It was like a dream, dancing the waltz in his arms. She was about to wake up from this dream in an instant. While they were dancing, Giovanni whisked her out of the hallway and slipped into the beautiful garden.</p>
<p>"Giovanni," Angela said calmly, pulling away from his embrace and looking at his face, "You should go home now, won't you?"</p>
<p>"Home?" he asked in surprise. "But why should I go home? Your father kindly invited me-"</p>
<p>"He didn't invite you," Angela said, looking at him sorrowfully.</p>
<p>"I know," he sighed. "You are completely right. A soldier meets a woman - a soldier falls in love with a woman - a woman does not fall in love with a soldier." He made a gesture of despair. He took her hand. They walked side by side along the flower path covered by moonlight. They stopped again by the fountain, silent. "You see," Giovanni finally spoke in the silent shadows of the flowers, "I just came to say goodbye to you. I am not good at writing letters, and words cannot convey my true feelings." He sighed again as he spoke.</p>
<p>"Giovanni!" Angela's voice trembled with sobs.</p>
<p>"I only want you to say," he said calmly, "Giovanni, I don't love you."</p>
<p>"Giovanni, I-" Angela's voice was still trembling: "We must not - we must not-"</p>
<p>"You can't say that! You can't say that, I know you love me!" he cried out. "I love you too! Angela!" He pulled her into his arms, holding her tightly. "Angela!" he shouted again hoarsely.</p>
<p>In the heat of emotion, she yielded.</p>
<p>"Giovanni!" Her cherry lips met his, she whispered sweetly!</p>
<p>But a voice of anger came flying in the moonlight, breaking their intimate joy. Following a shout of "Angela!" Monsignor Saracinesca's furious, frustrated face appeared before them.</p>
<p>He harshly told Giovanni to get out, not allowing the young man to speak again. Giovanni had no choice but to walk away lazily, but he also said sternly:</p>
<p>"I will come again tomorrow - I will ask you to marry me, Angela! I can say and do, Prince!"</p>
