<p>時評</p>
<h3>如何到繁榮之路？</h3>

<p>美國正當久陷於金融恐慌沈痼莫拔艱危存續之際。乃有一羅斯福焉。以一世之繁榮救星自負。於本年三月四日盡閉四十八州銀行。召開華盛頓談話會。停止金本位。拒絕同意倫敦會議之匯價安定談判。似隻手可撑天矣。然而核其經過。殊鮮實效。最近復於本月二十二日夜。播音全國。宣佈貨幣政策。務求物價高抬。期取得最後勝利。而其所擬之方法。第一步收買國内新出礦之黄金。使「美元」的貨物價值向下。第二步必要時將在世界市塲。如倫敦巴黎各地抛出「美元。」買進外幣。丨收買　金。使「美元」的匯兌價值向下。總之其期望在管理適當的通貨價值上搭橋。以渡到最後繁榮之路。但其所搭之橋。果能順利通行而一無危險乎。</p>
<p>果然。自羅斯福政策發表後。彼倫敦巴黎諸列强政府。莫不驚駭失措。嚴加戒備。爲禁止跌價的貨物進口。爲保障日日縮小的利潤。爲暢銷堆集如山的出品諸般便利。大家以先下手爲强。法國方面凖備美國　時在世界市場收買黄金者。即何時起而自衛。（本月二十五日哈瓦斯巴黎電）不但此也。法國爲憲法上之原因。不得不保留對於關税事務有自動與保護國家利益之權。巳通告國聯秘書處。（本月二十六日路透巴黎電）英國則早有匯兌安定基金三萬五千萬鎊。以爲凖備。所以英法二國對付之方法。無論高築税牆。仰或抑低貨幣價值。皆可進退裕如。手段亦甚高張。華盛頓「美元」跌價的方法。縱能使純金每翁士所值「美元」若干。可以操縱。然前途種種障壁。如何打破以上此通繁榮之路之橋乎。</p>
<p>况歐美各國之失去繁榮面目。自有根本上之矛盾。自本年一月至六月。法國生産指數由七八增至八八（一九一三爲基年。）英國由八九增至九一（一九二四爲基年。）美國則由五八增至八八（一九二三至一九二五平均爲基年。）貨物旣如此堆集。市塲如此狹窄。又將如何超越此當前生産過剩的危機。以誕登彼岸乎。</p>
<p>試觀羅斯福上台後之設施。誠不愧爲一大魔術家。但在此半年之中。物價上漲。以農産論。反由四三增至五四（一九二六爲基年。）以工藝論。亦由六七增至六九（一九二六爲基年。）農工之困苦。終無法以慰之。至於壓平種種罷業風潮。亦殊費力。今日世界各國之政治領袖。出其特殊專斷之手腕。苦心經營以建造此繁榮之橋者亦多矣。然未聞有能將基石奠定而吃然不摇者。故羅斯福收買國内外黄金政策。謂可使「美元」價值跌落。穩定下去。以進達於繁榮之路。吾人殊未敢信其有此移胎换骨之神工也。</p>
<h3>羅斯福新貨幣政策將引起國際通貨戰爭　美總統决在國外收買黄金　法國或將被迫放棄金本位　財長伍定辭職與否成時局之謎</h3>

<p>（巴黎）　法國金融界指羅斯福總統准在外國收買黄金之决議、乃强迫用全國放棄金本位之謀、有一不宣佈姓名之人、爲法蘭西銀行發言、謂美國未必收買許多現金、因美國在歐存欵無多也、又謂美總統此舉使預算案之平衡愈爲必要云、（三十日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　華盛頓人士預料美國在國外收買現金勢將引起國際通貨競爭、倫敦輿論亦同此見解、以爲美元與英鎊間尤不免於競爭、每日驛報金融記者謂他國有意合作阻撓羅斯福總統、金計劃之成功故羅總統始有此新舉動、現有良好根據可信英倫銀行與法蘭西銀行彼此合作、而於羅總統提高國内金價　輒購進美元、其實美元價值遲早必落、英法銀行苟不凖備在美元上作極大之投機、則此種反抗行動、目前必無成功之可能、其他唯一方法、厥在英鎊斷絕其與佛郎之聯絡、及間接拒絕金本位之聯絡耳云、金融時報謂美國在國外購金之舉、將危及他國實業與貨幣之安定云、（二十九日路透電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）　倫敦外匯市場今日開盤、頗有戒心、因美國决計在世界市場中收買黄金也、美元開盤價爲四元八二、波動頗驟、據紐約消息、華盛頓與紐約垣街之經濟學家預料如美國對於通貨隻手應付、則他國將採報復行動、而發生嚴重後果、英國將以商用通貨方法保障其商業地位、而法國將禁止現金出口、或放棄金本位、惟紐約時報則探悉昨夜羅斯福總統與其金融顧問在白宫集議時、頗有人主張繼續與英倫銀行商榷、此議至少當可爲英美匯兌最後安定之先聲云、紐約通報亦謂美國聯邦儲備銀行與法蘭西銀行間或可成立辦事恊定云、至於美國擬收買多少現金、今尚未定、（三十日路透電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）　美政府某要人今日稱、美總統仍欲繼續施行膨脹信用計劃、俟達一百萬萬元之原定目標而後已、此項計劃、雖迄今猶未能大有助於提高物價、但總統認其可以補充收買黄金政策、故兩項計劃、將同時並進、至每星期收購公債與其他擴大信用運動之數額、將視市場需要情形而酌量增减、日前美政府發表收購黄金計劃後、金融專家多預料信用膨脹將逐漸減縮、嗣觀於上星期聯邦儲備銀行收購公債數額之減少、似可徵實此種見解、今據某要人言、則兩者仍將相輔而行也、（二十九日國民社電）</p>

<p>（一）一九三五年華盛頓會議開會在即、日本與此有關係之國際的懸案甚多、故應在此時期積極樹立遠東和平根本方策、</p>

<h3>奥國政變與歐洲前途（下）　歐洲通信</h3>
<p>— 列山</p>
<p>爲的也算是德國的生死關頭、雖是這麽嚴重的打擊、却並不使希特勒灰心、國家社會黨在奥的活動、依然在秘密中進行、潛勢力還是不可侮的，希特勒在奥國的羣衆、有下列的幾種人、</p>
<p>（一）大學生、因爲出路問題、他們是傾向於希特勒、希望能得到生活的解决、</p>
<p>（二）一般市民階級、素常抱大德意志思想者、回念往日的繁榮、於此無可奈何中、將此希望、放在希特勒身上、盼望他把快樂帶給他們、</p>
<p>（三）農工貧苦羣衆、因爲生活壓迫、對於現狀不滿、希望有個前途、將生活改善、希特勒含有煽動性的宣傳、暫時却使他們相信而且滿足、</p>
<p>（四）平日無政治意味的人、只因爲感到奥國的經濟狀况、無法獨立生存、有部分人也易於接受希特勒的影響</p>
<p>總合上面的幾種人、與其說希特勒在奥的勢力是政治造成的、不如說他是被經濟迫成的、法意等國、自然也看穿這一點、他係正在這方面努力、設法想根本的把希特勒在奥的勢力打消、不過世界經濟恐慌巳到了如此深刻的程度、大家都自顧不暇、那有餘力來帮忙奥國、此其一、其次、縱有餘力、奥國經濟的病根巳深、也非一朝一夕所能馬上恢復的、並且奥國的情形、已是十分危急、稍一差延、變局立至、多福斯聯合政府的基礎本極不穩固、不但在議會方面、不能獲得過半數票就是政府黨内部、永克勒與司塔咸堡間無法解决的對立、也是遲早要爆發的、那時第三者恐怕要乘機從中得利、尤其前國防部長浮吉恩的力量、不足以應付全局一面爲國内外的政治環境所逼、獨裁政權的確立、也只是時間問題、加之永克勒與多福斯間主張日見分道、這一切使多福斯非趕快將獨裁政府提前成立不可、尤其必須在九月二十四日國際聯盟第十四年度常會開會以前、以免他離奥後、永克勒先行發動、於是他在九月十一日用一個用無線電話、傳播的演講中、第一次很明顯的宣佈他的主張、就是爲了應付非常巨變、並說明奥國非有獨裁的政府不可、他極明白的說、議會制度與自由主義在今日、巳無存在的價值、自由資本主義的思想並資本主義的社會、與經濟的制度、都是過了時代了，他說、我們要創造一個基督社會主義的德意志民族的奥國、這個國家、他解釋作必須採用「守業制度」（註錄後）由强有力的政府來執行、他這一篇演詞、雖使大家吃了一驚、但是却在意料之中、二十日他即將聯合政府解散、重新組成一個完全個人獨裁的政府、前副總理永克勒即離職他去、</p>
<p>多福斯獨裁政府新閣員、名單如下、</p>
<p>内閣總理　多福斯博士（兼外交、國防、保安、農林四部長）、</p>
<p>副總理　費少佐、</p>
<p>敎育兼司法部長　周區湼克博士、</p>
<p>財政部長　卜禮區博士、</p>
<p>商業兼交通部長　司托肯格、</p>
<p>掛名部長　英得博士（修改憲法與行政）</p>
<p>開伯博士（管理内政）、</p>
<p>看了這個名單、我們所得的印像、無疑的多福斯是在模倣莫索利尼了、他將軍警（國防與保安二部）兩權、一手操住因爲非如此、他是無法獨裁的、他赴日内瓦出席國際聯盟會議的行前、他又發表了一次談話、除了施政方針外、特别注重介紹新副總理費少佐、說他爲人作事、魄力如何堅强、追溯他在歐戰時的經過、並在軍隊方面的淵源等等、這就等於告訴他的敵黨、你們搗亂可要當心了、</p>
<p>二十三日費少佐用副總理的名義重新頒佈一九一七年七月二十四日的戒嚴令、一切權力、更是具體的完全集中於軍警手中、接着雖然也發生過一些騷亂、但暫時還不足以爲患的、至於多福斯本人、却坐在日内瓦國際聯盟席上、與德代表宣傳部長哥白爾大開其外交的舌戰了、</p>
<p>經過這回的變動、歐洲的狀况、由此逐漸更加複雜、裂痕也更加深刻、奥國的前途甚至於歐洲的前途、都要看以後事實的發展如何了、</p>
<p>在目前意大利似乎多佔一些便宜、</p>

<h3>蕪湖米糧實况　米市已呈活躍狀態　建廳擬定救濟方法</h3>
<p>蕪湖通信、安徽爲産米之區、每年産量、除供當地民食外、實有六百萬至一千萬石之剩餘、大部分由蕪湖出口、换取現金、供給鄉村農民及繳納税賦之用、並以調劑國内民食、因此蕪湖之大部分商業、以及全皖之經濟、莫不以蕪湖之米市爲轉移、其間經營米業者、約分下列之組織、（一）米糧採運業同業公會、此類商人、專以在蕪採購米糧運銷外埠、如廣潮烟寗四帮、皆係採集運往廣東潮州烟台寗波山東浙江平津等處、各帮所設之米號、現有二十七家、（二）米行同業公會、係收買村鎭之來米、轉售於採運業者、此等米行、統計有五十家、（三）機器碾米業同業公會、係將鄉間到蕪之糙米碾成熟米、或設堆棧專租於米行米號者、現有九家、（四）礱坊業公會、爲舊式礱坊、專代人礱米而收取租金者、現存在者仍有四十九家、（五）雜糧業米行公會、營業性質、專以日常販賣米糧供給本市人民日食之用、故又别稱爲小市、</p>
<p>蕪湖米出口、歷年來數量之增减不一、要亦由於外埠之消納量高下不均、而本省各縣秋收、每年豐歉不一也、自民國十一年以來、蕪米出口、當以十四年爲多、數爲六百十七萬石、平均價格爲關平銀四兩四錢、總值二千七百萬兩以外、以後則受洋米之排擠、每况愈下、至於本年自一月至七月底止、出口已達一百六十八萬石、總值一千零三十八萬銀元、八月後新穀登塲、又值大熟豐收、各縣旣大量向蕪輸送、且廣潮等處今年秋收減色、國人又一致要求增收洋米傾銷税、於是各方爭向蕪湖購辦、最近每日恒有三四萬石出口、米市之活躍、可以概見、若政府實行增徵洋米税、則前途更大有望、惟蕪米雖已暢銷、然於農民則實無利可言、蓋目前米價雖已稍漲、但比之已往高價、猶相差遠甚、當九月中旬、蕪米價值每石四兩五錢關平銀、（合洋六元六角三分）農民所得則僅五元餘耳、</p>
<p>蕪湖大量過剩米糧之去路、旣如上述、北方有烟台·天津·大連·青島、東部有上海·寗波、東南有廣州·汕潮等大埠、且均有數十年之歷史、乃自洋米由安南印度暹羅輸入傾銷、年共二千二百四十餘萬石、蕪米銷路所受之影響、已不言而喻、他若國内米商限於資本、旣不能大量迅速運銷、又有不肖商人、攙水以致不克久留、是皆爲國米當前之最大危機、進展固談不到、日漸衰落、亦意中事耳、</p>
<p>因此救濟蕪湖之米市、在今實爲刻不容緩之要圖、皖建廳前曾特派專員陳必貺來蕪調查、結果對於挽救蕪湖米市之方法、擬定下列數項、將呈請政府採擇、特誌於下、（一）請政府立即增加洋米進口税、其税率必須按現行市價抽百分之三十、（二）米業之組織、應使集體化、由政府重新登記、奬勵資本集中之組織、（三）設立米糧檢騐機關、專事檢騐米質、（四）減低米市一切之消費、使米糧成本减輕、（五）提倡農村運銷合作社、（六）國營輪船公司、應準備多量運輸船隻、以極廉價格、供國米之運輸、使米糧易於流通、（二十七日）</p>

<p>孔氏首述財政上開源節流兩點、開源無非設法增加税收、今中央税入、如統税菸酒税鹽税等、各地收入旺淡不同、有待於整頓開發、或增闢税源、然應依照國民經濟與社會現狀而定、我國國家實非貧窮、所貧窮者國人非盡利用以厚生耳、蓋我國地域廣大、物産豐富、遠勝於其他國家、然貨散於地、大都未經開發、此即俗語所謂「持金盌討飯」者也、而富源之所以未能開發、與税收之未有起色、大都限於環境、連年天災人禍、匪患蜂起、使人民不能安居樂業、日就貧困、國家收入、亦因而減少、民裕始國富、此固不易之理也、故近日最要之急務、即剿平匪患、匪患平後、人民始得安居樂業、農村有復興之望、元氣恢復、即税源亦可因之而旺盛矣、蓋社會元氣恢復後、民富增加之後、此時政府欲增徵税收、人民方有擔負之能力也、但如何開源、現正從事研究、必求所開之源、有益於國、無害於民、庶幾所開者爲醴泉、否則不顧一切、徒求目前能增加收入、而不計人民負擔能力與所蒙影響、結果必致民生日困、而國家亦益陷窘境、則所開爲毒源或苦水矣、故國家徵税、必以國民生計爲凖則、如在美國、人民之納税義務、以收入之多寡、科其對國家擔負之輕重、然我國尚未易言此、以我國税收、主要爲田賦、官吏祗知向農民納税、并不問其歳收之豐歉、及田地之荒熟、因之負擔不均、農民日困而豪富之人、反未多對國家負擔義務、故今後財政、尤當注重於培養元氣、</p>
<h3>從事節流</h3>
<p>以言節流、亦須詳審實際情况不能一概而言、凡無益消耗之流、應力加堵塞、不使絲毫流出、蓋一絲一毫、皆出之於人民汗血所得、正當之流、不但不應撙節、尤當使流益暢達譬如建設上之費用、即不應節之一種、因建設事業愈發達、則國内生産力愈益强、而於國家之税收愈有補助、故正當之流、實寓　開源之功效、譬之治水潰堤决口之水、則應堵口免爲民害、反之有關水利者、應鑿渠疏浚、俾受蒞溉之利也、</p>
<h3>宋非得已</h3>
<p>總之、宋部長過去對於財政上建設上均有極大功績、此次辭職、實緣國家財政、困難已達極點、否則宋部長過去多年、已在艱難困苦之中、運籌握算、渡過許多難關、今又何必如此堅决、度情揆理、實出於萬不得已、同時即係明白告人、財政已至困難極點、此後苟不從事撙節力避消耗、已不能渡此難關矣、故今後無論軍政各界、皆當有鑒於此、庶全國一致合作、以協助政府勉渡難關、然後可走上預算平衡之道、而注力於建設事業、</p>
<h3>經濟建設</h3>
<p>宋部長辭財長以後、中央將請其專力於經濟委員會及國際技術合作事宜、我國因産業落後、國力衰弱、今後非急起直追、不能平衡於國際、故中央對經濟建設、極爲注重、宋部長學識經騐均爲國人所欽仰、且國際對華技術合作、及棉麥借欵、均宋部長所接洽、預料今後我國經濟建設工作、得宋氏領導必蒸蒸日上也、</p>
<h3>奉命之初</h3>
<p>本人此次奉命出長財政、自維不善理財、故奉命之初慚惶無旣、未敢拜受、祇以政府任命官吏、有如國家徵兵、旣巳被徵、亦難推卸、况蔣委員長及汪院長等、僉謂、非僅居財政部長名義者、應負其責、國府同人、均應負此責任、恊助一切、即宋部長雖去職、亦必盡力帮忙、余遂不敢固辭、此後誓當以培養税源、興辦民利、恢復社會元氣爲職志云、</p>
<h3>次長問題</h3>
<p>至於次長問題、外間雖傳說紛紜、然皆未可憑信、因鄒李兩次長、與本人皆屬稔友、在革命軍北伐以前、余任廣東財政廳長時、兩次長皆曾爲余之助、今後亦必能仍爲余助、雖中國官塲向例恒有同進退之事、然兩次長辭職、或係出於謙遜之故、决不因個人進退關係現因本人尚未就職、一時亦難詳談、然深信兩次長、必能以助余而助國家也、外傳交通部兪次長（飛鵬）將任次長之說、非確詞、兪次長大才槃槃、倘能爲余助、喜且不勝、但現在勦匪軍事緊張之際、辦理軍站運輸、非常重要、恐難輕離耳、</p>
<h3>宋氏昨行動召集屬員</h3>
<p>昨晨八時起、政務次長鄒琳·常務次長李調生·總務司長鄧勉仁·公債司長鄭萊錢幣司長徐堪曁參事秦頴春等、並統税署長謝琪·鹽務稽核繶所長朱庭祺·等、均應宋前部長之召、先後趨西愛咸斯路財部駐滬辦事處、對於辦理移交事宜、有所會商、</p>
<h3>虞氏謁宋</h3>
<p>市參議員工部局華董虞洽卿、於昨晨九時廿分、至西愛咸斯路財部駐滬辦事處謁見宋部長慰問、</p>
<h3>宋子文談話</h3>
<p>宋子文氏昨晨十時、在西愛咸斯路財政部駐滬辦事處接見、各報社新聞記者、作下列之談話、</p>
<h3>早蓄辭意</h3>
<p>宋氏首稱、余因種種困難、久蓄辭意、所以不願早宣佈者、以政府未决定繼定人選之前、在青黄不接之際、恐將影響市塲及金融、今日報載各團體紛電中央挽留、詞意懇切、余除感謝其盛意外、深幸未早宣佈之得策、否則頗使個人出處及金融市場等、均將蒙受其影響矣、</p>
<h3>去職原因</h3>
<p>余所遞辭呈、頗難措詞、因我國舊習、辭職者每以病爲言、官吏去職、什九云病、致貽外人以東亞病夫之譏、本人素無疾病、出國四五月、身體素健、倘亦藉口於病、殊非平日以誠相孚之旨、故直承材力不足、今中央亦根據此呈、准余卸責、語至此、記者詢以困難原因、是否涉及外交與財政上不易平衡之實况、宋氏答今中央已根據余所上辭呈照准、似餘言均非必要、願不談及此、</p>
<h3>經會常委</h3>
<p>全國經濟委員會、雖爲用欵機關、不若財部之需籌欵、常務委員職、中央未允余辭、但是否繼續擔任、因近日忙於辦理移交、無暇考慮、一時尚難作肯定答復、至財政方面、今後旣由孔部長負責個人如有所見及、能力所及、當然隨時可貢獻於當局、</p>
<h3>職員進退</h3>
<p>財部各職員除内部襄助人員巳遞辭呈即將引退外、至各税收機關、主管人員、同爲國家服務、苟非繼任部長覓得接替人選、不能因余個人進退而輕於言去、故在余未交代以前、對税收機關人員之辭呈、均不予批准、想渠等富於責任心、亦必以國家爲重也、</p>
<h3>金融無碍</h3>
<p>嗣記者詢以前星期因部長有辭職訊、致公債市場逐步跌落、今部長去職、是否將使金融市場發生更重大之影響、宋氏答、今繼任人選已决定、一切均可照常進行、金融市場、决不致發生影響也、</p>
<h3>暫不離滬</h3>
<p>最後記者、詢宋是否他往、宋答日内在滬辦理移交、以後亦不擬他往、因余旣非因病去職、無庸易地休養也、</p>
<h3>汪精衛來滬</h3>
<p>新新社云、行政院長汪精衛、原擬於前日來滬、嗣以蔣委員長回京、因會商宋氏辭職問題、未克登　、兹據接近汪氏者傳出消息、謂汪氏定於昨晚、由京乘夜快車來滬晤宋、今晨七時可抵埠、一般人咸料中央旣已准宋辭職、汪氏來滬晤宋、實無甚要公、恐汪氏之來、與其本身有關、惟據昨日下午新任財政部長孔祥熙氏稱、汪氏明日（即今日）來滬、係面勸宋氏繼任經委會常委、而外傳汪氏消極之說、實出於推測云、</p>
<p>中央社三十日南京電云、汪院長於三十日下午五時半、行政院會散後即返鐵部一號官邸、旋孫科來訪、共商經委會事務、汪孫三十日晚十一時、附掛花車赴滬、褚民誼·曾仲鳴·唐有壬·隨行、據褚談、汪孫赴滬任務係與宋商經委會進行並在滬舉行常委會議、决定、經委會第一次全體委員日期、現經委會各項經濟計劃、亟待進行、盼宋常委來京主持、俾可推進會務云、財部鄒李兩次長辭呈、巳至行政院、三十日院會未討論、聞行政院决予慰留、但另據確息、鄒李中有一人决求去繼任人選、尚待孔祥熙與汪商酌、</p>
<h3>市民應援助剿匪軍　吳市長昨在紀念週之報告</h3>
<p>中央社云、吳市長昨在市政府紀念週報告勦匪之重要、其原詞如下、各位同志、我們中國現在有一個最大心腹之患、此心腹之患、比什麽都要危險、足以妨害新中國之建設、中華民族之復興、更足以牽制我政府抵禦外侮及國防之建設、我們回想這幾年、我們政府、在積極方面、旣不能依照總理的遺敎、完成政治的經濟社會的各種建設、在消極方面又不能澈底、安定地方、使老百姓絕對安居樂業、無一不是受此心腹之患之牽制、其爲害程度、可想而知、此心腹之患、是什麽東西、就是土匪、共産黨利用土匪、爲禍中國、而匪區地形複雜匪徒出没無常、遇見國軍、則化整爲零、國軍一去、又合零爲整自古以來、剿匪原非易易、現在之匪、更狡猾難勦、且匪利用國家不統一、合勦難成得苟延滋蔓、因此之故、我政府之各種建設工作、都不能實施或完成、人民亦不能安居樂業、此種牽制、所以成爲我國家最大心腹之患、此心腹之患不消除、最足以使國家崩潰、民族淪亡、何以見得呢、就是因爲這個心腹之患、一方面妨害我們國家的建設、一方面又妨害全國國民經濟生活的發展、那當然使我們的國家和民族祗有一天一天的衰弱下去、而此種衰弱、不但减少我們的抵禦外侮的力量、並且足以引誘人家對我國起一種野心、而使我們對内與對外、都無所措手、所以政府在這兩年以來、雖在外患萬分危急的時候、而對勦匪工作、不稍鬆懈、並下最大的决心、無論如何、也必須將土匪肅清、對内旣可以剷除了中華民國建設的障碍、對外也可以剷除了抵禦外侮的障碍、然後把全國人民的意旨和力量、集中起來、一遇外患、我們就能夠全國總動員來抵抗、這點是我們全國人民所應該十分認識清楚的、其次講到上海與勦匪的關係、上海市是全國經濟的一個重鎭、而上海市之繁榮、有賴於内地農村之安定、换言之、我國内地農村破産、或不安定、則上海繁榮之可能性、也就一天一天的減少、如果我們能在消極方面努力於内地農村之安定、而在積極方面能設法使内地農村經濟復興起來、使農民的生産力增加、那末上海的繁榮、不但得以維持、並且也可以逐漸增加、而安定内地復興農村的第一步工作、就是勦匪、所以勦匪也就是間接促進我們上海市的繁榮、因此上海市在本星期内、就要舉辦援助勦匪軍運動與勦匪宣傳週、爲剿匪軍聲援、並唤起上海市民認清此剿匪與上海前途之密切關係、同時上海因特殊情形、反動份子、就利用此點、秘密活動、故甚望上海市民、對此等潛伏市内而所知道的反動份子、爲國家民族的利益計、同時、也就是爲自身的利益計應向所在地警署告密舉發、來帮助政府、肅清他們、同時對於前方剿匪部隊、也應予以精神上物質上的援助、鼓厲他們督促他們來完成剿匪的全功、這才是我們上海市民對此次剿匪軍總攻擊的開始、所應有之熱烈與誠懇之表示、</p>

一個富家子弟，吃得肉討厭了，一天他看見一個面黄肌瘦的鄉下人，問他爲什麽這般消瘦；鄉下人告訴他，年頭不好，没有飯吃。富家子弟聽了，輕描淡寫的說道，「你旣然飯没有吃，那麽你爲什麽不吃肉呢？」一般的不知物價。使聽得的人，祗好發着苦笑。　　做了兇鬼捉死你　我國人的迷信，是根深蒂固的。善男信女，不必說了，一班智識份子，也提倡什麽騐經救國。這雖是笑話，可是神道設敎，自也有一種不可思議的魔力。在湖匪猖獗的時候，有一個被擄的肉票，經了幾次接洽，終不能談妥條件，於是最後一着，就要實行撕票。那肉票也知死在目前，哀求也没有用處，於是他鼓起勇起，瞧着那班匪徒，惡狠狠的說道；「好！你們把我殺死，我都認得你們，看我死了，不做了兇鬼，一個個捉死你們」。那一班天不怕地不怕的綁匪，聽了這話，你看着我，我看着你，結果這位肉票，就毫無條件的釋放出來。迷信的力量，豈不大哉！　　謝局長體恤　有一個在政界裡斡事的人，告訴人一樁趣事。某縣有一個公安局長，因他的屬下，一個科長，做錯了事，預備把他撤差。事先那局長招科長來談話，他們接談之後，局長先笑微微的問道；「足下對於轄境中情形，諒必十分熟悉。一那科長以爲局長有什麽委任的竭誠答覆道；「熟悉，熟悉。」局長又道；足下在執行職務的當兒，「有没有障礙」？科長又竭力答覆道；「没有，没有。」局長笑道；「足下的精神，眞太辛苦了！」科長又連忙謙虚道！「還好，還好！」那知局長忽調轉口氣道；「但我以爲足下太辛苦了，擬請暫時休息一下」。這一勺冷水，淋到那科長頭上，頓使科長的尊容，弄得哭笑不得。可是又不能不敷衍局長，祇能强打笑臉，顫顫的說；「是。是。謝謝局長體恤！」　　吃飯與查崗　在某公安局長吃飯的當兒。忽想着分局長，打個電話到分局裡去，可是電話接通之後，那邊的週番報告說，分局長出外巡崗去了；隔了一歇，局長又打電話到分局的樓上，那邊的週番，却回答說局長出去吃飯了。於是局長留了一個電話，請分局長到局裡談話。他們見面之後，局長笑對分局長道「足下太勤勞了，吃飯兼要查崗，以後我請你在吃飯的時候，不要查崗；在查崗的當兒，且慢吃飯。……」局長的話還没說完。那位分局長早像關公一般，滿臉緋紅，變了一個十足的血頭！</p>

<p>自由談自由談觀紹興戲有感  楊靈　　三國志演義上說：關公的隂魂附在吕蒙身上，大呌道：「還我頭來！」　　單看這一節，也許有人會相信關公的頭是被借了去的。但通讀三國演義的看官們就知道：事實上並不如此。吕蒙殺這頭時，並未得到其所有者的同意，借票是當然不曾立下的。所以關公的頭，只能說被刦，不能說被借。　　眞正被借去頭的，據說乃是高行周。不過我所「據」的，不是五代史！那裏面說，高行周享年七十八，是「以疾薨」的！而是紹興戲，這得先行聲明，免招博雅君子們的駁斥。却說紹興戲中，有一齣呌做「高平關」；此關即高行周所鎭守。行周能識天文，有一夜觀看星象，見赤鬚龍下凡、應在趙匡胤身上，當有九五之分。是時，趙匡胤在周王郭威駕前爲臣，誇下大口，說自己能將行周首級取來，獻給周王，周王就將他的父母收在監中，以作抵押，命他前去取行周首級。行周預知此事，若論本領，趙匡胤决難溷入高平關，傷他毫髮，無奈此是「天數」，他若不將首級借給匡胤，就難免五雷殛身。因此他預將高平關兵權，交付兒子執掌，自己專等趙匡胤到來，將交换條件議妥，隨即自刎，讓匡胤把頭帶去立功。　　在紹興戲中，這一齣最富悲劇的意味。「天數」和「人情」的矛盾紛紜於一身的高行周，由出色的鬚生扮演出來，實在極其動人。當「天數」得了最後勝利的時候，在一同被定命論所壓倒的看客之羣中，也可以聽到悲歎之聲。　　高行周是英雄。十三歳的時候，他就能刺殺後梁的大將王彦章，爲父報仇。（亦據紹興戲）就是到了那命定的最後一天，趙匡胤幾次暗算，也還近不得他的身。是這樣的勇士，然而，在「天數」之前，他就無能爲力，連必不可借的頭，也只得借給别人了。　　這樣的定命論，未免太使英雄短氣，然而實在是很可爲懦天解嘲。所以在中國的人民間，牠常常持着深而廣的支配力。　　頭是必不可借的，借去就不成其爲人；同樣，土地也是必不可借的，借去就不成其爲國。然而，借頭的人竟會有，借土地的人竟也有，同是三國演義上的「借荆州」，也許出於小說家的渲染，而中國各地的「租借地」，則明明是事實。　　還有東四省，外蒙古……等等許多的土地，都巳不復爲我所有，那不是「借」而是「失」，雖同樣可以諉諸「天數」，但論起面子來，到底「借」字還比較冠冕堂皇得多了。　　許多地圖上面，常常印着岳武穆的手筆於一切「失地」或「借地」都可適用的一句很好的口號。新發見的「倒譯」與「直譯」  魏鑑青　　許是因爲國内讀書人對於硬性的理論讀物感到厭倦了吧，近來傳記一類的書倒又有人要讀！。僅僅就我所知道的，上海與北平一年間所出版的名人傳記巳有十餘種，這比之「作文法」「日記文選」「名人書信」一類的應時書固然大有遜色，可是和鳳　麟角的社會科學名著比起來，巳經是蔚然可觀了。在傳記中，翻譯或編譯的較之編著的爲多，有幾部因譯編的手法比較高妙，讀起來是很覺得輕鬆毫不吃力的，如韜奮編譯的高爾基，徐懋庸譯的托爾斯泰傳，石葦編譯的蕭伯訥傳，……等等就很可一讀。不過也有的是硬凑成功的，如果你没有猜謎的勇氣與「削爛蘋果」的决心，就保你讀不下去。我最近讀韓起先生譯的列寧回憶錄，就是很費了一點苦功的，因爲這是一部罕見的天書，我從中發見了不少駭人之譯。　　幸而這部譯書有好些地方註了英文，可以手邊雖没有英譯本，還可以省了許多猜謎之煩與暗中摸索之苦，譬如有一部書名呌做“Ｗhat　Different　People　Lve　On”（俄國人民意志黨出版，原意爲：「各色人民所賴以爲生者爲何」或「各界人的生活方式」）韓君就勇敢地譯作「活人不同點何在？」我倒被他弄得怔起來了，不禁在書上批了一句。「這個譯名與原文的「同點何在」？』我疑心韓君是將原文讀倒了，讀作“Live　PeopleDifferent　What　On”，才有這樣的「倒譯，」要是没有英文註起來，我簡直以爲人民意志黨曾經出過這樣的一部生理學書了，後來我又百折不回的讀下去，總算又得到了不少收穫。最令我吃驚的是他　“Ｔhe　Motive　Forces　＆　Perspectives　of　the　Ｒussian　Ｒevolution”（俄國革命的動力與遠景）一書名顚倒譯作「發動力與俄國革命的遠景，」他似乎不懂得怎樣去安置of一字，以致將「發動力」單吊起來了，還有Ｂlacn　Hundreds（黑色百人團）韓君不知是什麽古董，就索性「直譯」爲「黑百圈。」又Ｐlenum（擴大會議）這字他根據綜合英漢辭典在下面用括弧加了一個譯者按，說「此字與Vacuum相反，是一物質電氣充實之意」，諸如此類的妙譯不勝枚舉，這還没有替他對照原書。　　依我的觀感，這樣的譯書是太勇放了。然而韓君總算是老實人，他能將原文標出，不掩飾自己的錯誤，可以說是難能可貴的。　　希望翻譯傳記及其他書籍的人當心點，强不知以爲知與馬虎的亂譯是最誤人的。　　然而我們是需要好的翻譯的三論花鼓戲  何如　　予旣於自由談兩論花鼓戲之起源矣。或以爲予於花鼓戲具有深嗜篤好，而有若何之研究。實則予不過搜集花鼓戲本三百數十種，曾作民間戲曲之研究一文，刊於社會雜誌，爲其研究之發端而已。歐陽予倩氏因幼時愛看花鼓，長而走入戲劇界。彼嘗有志改良花鼓，事竟未成。又有樂嗣炳先生者與余同趣，亦搜得兩粤流行之花鼓戲本不少。如此僻藝，好者二三，而予以無用之人，談此無用之藝，尤爲相當也。　　盛清趙甌北陔餘叢考，謂江蘇諸郡，每歳冬必有鳳陽人來，老幼男婦，成行逐隊，散入村落乞食。至明春二三月間始回。其唱歌則曰家住廬州并鳳陽，鳳陽原是好地方。自從出了朱皇帝，十年倒有九年荒，以爲被荒而逐食也。然年不荒，亦來乞食如故。蚓菴瑣語云，明太祖時，徙蘇於杭嘉湖富民十四萬户以實鳳陽，逃歸者有禁，是以托丐潛回省慕探親，習以成俗，至今不改。由此而言，鳳陽花鼓之所以流行，經濟上之原因，與政治上之原因，殆兼而有之也。突圍（續）  施蟄存　　（七）我看到周木齋先生的「文學與道德」，眞的感覺到「莊子」還不夠學作文了。他說了半天也没說到題目上去。文學與道德怎樣呢？大概是他不高興我提出「勸青年修養道德」這行爲，而他的理由似乎是攻擊「文以載道」的思想。現代中國青年是應該澈底的給他們一點道德修養的，我所舉的三本書，雖然不是道德法律，但有許多地方還是可取的。這是我的意思，但這與「文以載道」有何關係呢？　　否定新文學和舊文學的分界與承認字有死活，這其間並無矛盾。舊文學中有許多字可以用到新文學中來。這仍舊是活字，而且成爲新文學，有些字没有方法再復活轉來，祗好讓牠留在舊文學裏，便永遠是舊文學。　　周先生以爲「推薦莊子等書，雖然跡無可取，但是情有可原的。」我却以爲應該换一個說法：這是「跡有可取」，但從頭就被誤解了：而「情無可原」，因爲……不說了。　　陳子展先生在他的文章裏對於我一則曰；「當代有名的作者」，再則曰「那樣有名的現代小說作家」，使我很不敢當，周先生則要我援泯滅是非之例，進而「看破生死」，我因爲泯滅是非，故曾聲明不想再多說話，但現在是因爲看不破生死，不願被圍剿到烏江自刎，遂有「突圍」之輩，雖然這個圍能否突出不可知，但死是不會死的，再引一句龔定食；「德堅能不况，心苦惱無名」。　　右答周木齋先生　　（八）對於豐之餘先生，我的確曾經「打了幾拳」，這也許會成爲我畢生的遺憾。但是豐先生作「撲空」，其實並未「空」，還是撲的我，站在豐先生那一方面的（或者說站在正邪說那方面。）文章却每天都在「剿」我，而我却眞有「一個人的受難」之感了。　　但是，從「撲空」一文中，我發現了豐先生作文的遍輯，他說：「我早經聲明，先前的文字並非專爲他個人而發的，」但下文却有：「因爲他辯駁的話比我所預料的還空虚」。不專爲我而發，但巳經預料我會辯駁，這又該作何解？　　因爲被人「指摘」了，我也覺得「莊子與文選」這兩本書誠有不妥處，於是在給大晚報編輯的信裏，要求他許我改兩部新文學書，事實確是如此的。我並不說豐先生是恨我没有推薦這兩部新文學書而「反對莊子與文選」的，而豐先生却說我存着這樣的心思，這又豈是「有倫次」的話呢？　　豐先生又把話題搭到「顔氏家訓」，又搭到我自己正在讀的兩本書，併爲一談，說推薦「顔氏家訓」是在敎育年學鮮卑語，彈琵琶，以服事貴人，而且我還以身作則，在讀一本洋書；說顔之推是「儲士似的，却又歸心於佛」，因而我也看一本佛書；從豐先生的解釋看起來，竟連我自己也失笑了，天下事眞會這樣巧！（未完）兩兄弟　（十四）　  莫泊桑著李維克譯　　「不……不……羅蘭先生，明天，明天，在我的事務所裏，下午兩點鐘，如果你們有空的話。」　　「好的，好的，當然有空！」　　於是羅蘭嬷嬷也站起身，在流過眼淚之後，現在却微笑着，走近公證人，把手放在他的椅背上，以一個含着謝意的母親的那種感動的眼光瞧着公證人，問他道：　　「那麽你剛才答應的那杯茶要不要喝呢，勒卡魯先生？」　　「現在我很樂意喝了，羅太太。」　　使女唤來後，先去拿來了一些用很深的洋鐵盒盛着的乾點，那種好像做給鸚鵡那樣堅硬的嘴去啄的脆而無味的英國點心，那種　在一些金屬的盒子裏好像給人帶去環遊世界的點心。隨後她又距去拿來一些折成小方塊的灰色飯布，這種在寒素人家從來不洗的吃茶用的飯布。第三次她再跑去拿來了糖壺和茶杯；隨後她又跑去燒水去了。於是大家等待着。　　没有一個人能夠說出什麽；各人腦裏的事太多了，没有什麽話可說。祗有羅蘭太太尋出了幾句没有意思的話。她講着今天在海上去釣魚的事，把釣船「珍珠」號和陸醉米太太稱讚了一番。　　「滿漂亮，滿漂亮，」公證人一再說。　　羅蘭老爹把背靠在壁爐的大理石上，好像冬天爐子裏燒着火的時候一樣，兩手揷在口袋裡，嘴唇動來動去，像要吹哨起來，他被那種要把所有的快樂全都發洩出來的强烈的欲望所苦，再也不能安靜坐下了。　　兩兄弟則一左一右坐在客廳當中小圓桌旁的兩張同樣的靠椅裏，彼此都以相同的套勢把一條腿子又放在另一條腿子上，眼睛直視着前面，態度相似，而表情却完全不同。　　茶終於燒來了。公證人接過一杯，調了些糖，把一片小小的硬到啃不動的餅干在那裏面浸碎吃了之後，把茶喝乾了，隨後他便站起身和大家握了握手告辭出去。　　　「這事就是這樣啦，」羅蘭老爹重複說，「明天，在你那邊，兩點鐘時候。」　　「就是這樣，明天，兩點鐘。」　　哲安一句話都没有說。　　公證人走了以後，大家靜默了一下，隨後羅蘭老爹走去把兩個手掌拍着他那次子的兩肩呌說道：　　「怎的！好運道的小子，你還不抱吻我嗎？」於是哲安微微一笑，抱吻着他的父親說：」這事我並不覺得是必不能少的。」　　但這老實人再也抑制不住他的狂喜了。他走來走去，用他那拙劣的指甲在傢具上彈着，站在脚踵上旋舞着，再三說：　　「怎樣的幸運啊！怎樣的幸運啊！唉！這眞是一個幸運！」</p>

<p>談言希望的購買與賣販  雯　　在北伐以至定都南京那一時期，「破除迷信」的呼聲曾經囂然了好久，而「取締星相術士」的主張，也有不少的「同志」們在「促其實現」。那種空氣是很有壓力的，害得那些「賽柳莊」，「釣鰲客」之羣，都有些「惶惶如也」，有一部分的「識時務者」不等取締令下，就預爲「轉變」了。但是時間的流波不斷向前飛逝着，事實證明了那些「轉變」者的錯誤。因爲「破除迷信」的運動，不久就被人加以無形的「糾正」，而且變本加厲，推演而爲「時輪金剛法會」與班禪之爲「消弭國難」而唸經祈禱。　　那些以販賣希望爲職業的星相術士們不但未曾受到没落的襲擊，反而彈冠相慶：「吾道大行」！　　試翻開首都或上海的報紙一看，每一種至少登載着四家以上之「子評家」或「相術通神」的廣告：而且，有許多是由「冠蓋京華」的大人先生們出名爲之宣傳的。差不多每一家旅館飯店，都有一兩個這種「出賣希望」的特種營業者當常年的住客；而且，大都是「門庭若市」，有形形色色之文武，大小，貴賤，飽餓的「同志」們在那兒問「流年」，卜「休咎」。　　在一切都「不景氣」的現社會裏，「希望」的市場倒表現出非常的活躍，這現象是並非偶然而值得加以透視的。　　第一，「希望市場」的「景氣」，正是說明整個社會的「不景氣」，與大批「長衫失業工人」的無路可鑽。失業者不斷增加，生活的鞭子在許多人們的背上抽撻着，逼得大家都像「熱鍋上的螞蟻」一樣，亂闖亂鑽，出路找不着，前途黑漆一團，於百無聊賴之中，都不自覺地需要一種「望梅止渴」之精神上的安慰。根據這種變態的欲求，許多「天涯淪落」的都市失業者，就或是狂吸紙烟而幻想着萬元的禮劵或赤金檳榔樹，或是化一枚「袁世凱」來做一番五萬元暴發户的春夢。另一「殊途同歸」的取徑，就是化一兩元去叩那星相術士們的「希望之門」。自然，這種「希望」，有十萬分之九萬九千九百九十九要歸於紀滅的，但是所費無幾而預期的幸運並不會像「失去了安琪兒」那樣令人感到「生趣毫無」，至於跳燕子磯或黄浦江。所以，購買「希望」的結果固然往往不免於「四大皆空」，然而畢竟還有許多人「樂此不疲」。　　第二，「希望販賣者」之羣衆的「利市十倍」，是中國全社會結構之病態的反</p>

<p>映。中國的社會，一向是「因人的關係而設事」，絕少「因事的需要而找人」，結果就弄得一方面人人在「找事」（說得「摩登」一些，應該是「找工作」），一方面各機關衙門的冗員間差，塞了個滿坑滿谷。一切「銓叙」，「勞績」，「考勤」，「服務資格」都變成百無一用的具文，資格文憑，旣不能保障職業，又不能送入「長生庫」去换升斗的給養。凡此殘酷的現實，無往而不給與「長衫失業者」以歪曲的暗示：循着正軌去找生活，往往不免於「劣敗」，而最有效的謀生之術，並且是有「成功的前例」可考的，是應用「摩登登龍」的「五字訣」：吹，拍，鑽，䑛，棒！因此，許多聽鼓白下，潦倒海上的失業者之羣，都漸次忘記了怎樣去充實自己主觀之生活的技能和條件，只是無孔不入地去找「貴人提拔」的機會。能夠「洩露天機」，告訴人們以「七月交庚申的月令，主有偏財」或「西方必愚　人」之「可喜」消息的，自然是非「約鱉客」這一些「先知」們莫　了！　　由無希望之中找希望的人們大多，從權貴顯要之前找出路的人們太多，此「希望市場」之所以「獨向繁榮」也。　　寄無限之同情於一切購買「希望」的人們，同時並祝福他們能豁然醒悟，從幻想的歧途轉趨於實際，即：從粉碎這「罪孽深重」的現社會制度中，去求得一切「希望」的滿足！五十萬元  老三　　五十萬元，這末誘惑人的巨大數目，像火熖一般的燃燒在每個人的心頭。祗要你的發財捷徑的數字在三十一號的晚報上列在特奬之下，五十萬元的銀元鈔票，頓時將你的一切夢想實現，而且同時你的身價也可以無形之間增高，無論你現在是個討飯的乞丐，或者腿部運動的黄包車夫。不是嗎？上海的世界完全主宰在有錢人的掌握之中，滬西一帶，矗立在雲霄的洋房，不必踏進裏面去睡這末一覺，就在綠蔭蔽地的路旁走走，也可使你的生日時辰完全忘却、而且、那鐵門裏開出來的是雪亮的汽車，大菜間，電影院，跳舞場，還有許多我們不知名的所在，那般人們是恭候着你的駕到，要娶個巳如花的美眷，那是像打一個電話到大西洋去呌客大菜一樣的容易，整個上海的世界，在他們手掌之中打翻身。在旁邊這末瞧着瞧着的，豈不是使人眼眶裏爆出火星來？不過你們緊抓着卅元一月薪水的書記位置，或者日以繼夜，寢食俱廢的用腦力寫文章的酸小子哼！别說你一世，就是你的子子孫孫努力上去，不知能否買一個汽車胎來供在觀世音面前過過癮？你們祇能在大菜館門前嗅嗅香，跳舞場路旁聽聽音樂，就是做出來的夢，也不會好到那裏去的，頂多像化子拾金似的，有了黄金也變銅。所以，你懂得嗎？在彩票禁絕後的現在，又有可以使你摇身一變的好機會，第一次的五十萬元，巳被一個不知名的人搶去了，你閉着眼睛想一想罷，那個人現在是什麽光景，就是你最知已的朋友，恐怕也不能見他一面了，他已經將這上海玩弄着，無閒來顧及像你這般的大物，不過，在這裏的都是很聰明的，你總已想到他是一個人，我也是一個人，不是我也能享受這五萬元的「人」的幸福嗎？所以丨第二個所以，我告訴你，祇有幾天了，五萬元的鈔票已飛在你的窗外，你快把窗子開罷，放過了這機會，那你正得一世苦！雖然或者還有第三次的發行，但是多一個機會不是更好嗎？我想你們不見得有了五十萬，就不轉一百萬的念頭？總而言之，統而言之，世界上再没有更好的發財機會了。買！快買！我還能義務介紹一個保中奬金的所在，就是東新橋口的一家烟紙店，知道嗎？乘五路電車到洋涇浜，門口有大紅紙寫着的就是，紅紙上寫的就是保中奬金的證據：「若買十張，保能中奬，如若不中，加倍還洋。」我們烟紙店的老闆，旣巳像小糊塗般的算準了買十張保能中奬，我們叨在上等階級的八字，難道反而不及一個烟紙店老闆嗎？他告訴你買十張保能中奬，還含着廣告性質，我告訴你祗要買一張就能中奬：第一次的航空奬劵人家不是買了一張就是個特奬嗎？　　不過你們讀過三民主義嗎？孫中山先生告訴你一個扛夫買了一張奬劵，恐怕遺失，放在他日夜不離身的竹槓中，而牢記着牠的號碼。到開奬的日子，他的號碼正是頭奬，這時候丨你們須得　靜，别像那扛夫似的將那牢什子的槓棒向黄浦中一投，以爲可以一般子不做苦工了，可是那奬劵！命運之神也隨了到黄浦中心，所謂化爲流水，就是這般光景，所以！第三個所以，請你特别牢記着，要鎭靜，不然，你們願意把白花花的洋鈿不换五十萬的鈔票而化爲流水嗎？完了。窘  一蘋　　「天下無難事，只怕老面皮」這句話一點不差，祗要面皮一老，什麽事都做得出來，再也不致於弄得面紅耳赤的窘態畢露。記者從脱離學校到今，五年於兹，碰過壁的次數難以計算，橡皮頂子之類眞是不足稱道的小事，自以爲這張面皮下過磨礪功夫，已有「老」的資格，却不料跌翻在一羣「小」姑娘的手裏，烏可以不記？　　上星期六是個朋友結婚佳期，我和另一個朋友相約着早一點去參觀結婚禮。他在西門附近的一個女子中學裏作敎師，允許我一點鐘之前到我家裏。　　爲了是吃喜酒，我化了三角小洋把一套西裝　得甚爲挺刮，穿着完畢，專等我的朋友駕到，看着時計已過了他的約會，我想或者學校裏有什麽事没有整理完畢，我是便路，到他學裏去看他吧。　　走到校門口，因爲自己有幾年没有接觸這所在，尤其是女學校、舉動的不自然，顯然和某一種來訪的人物相吻合。那門房笑臉着問我找誰，我告訴他ＸＸＸ先生，像出於他意料似的向我要了一張名片。在我的意思，就在門房口站立一會也不妨事，那門房滿恭敬的「先生，請到裏面來坐」。　　我無可無不可地隨着他裏走，是一條石砌的甬道，一羣穿着國貨旗袍提着小皮箱的女學生迎面走來，對於我這穿了挺刮西裝的來賓，都不約而同的微笑。我明道也這微笑是包括着某一種意義，不過我不能聲明我是來訪Ｘ先生的，這時候我就微微的感到窘，不知從前冒了表弟名義的時候，是否有這種態度？　　幸而在甬道的一間小屋就是會客室，先我而在的有三位滿漂亮的西裝少年，他們的態度都是那樣自然，有的抽着捲烟，有的展開報紙讀着電影院的廣告，最無聊的也反剪了手瞧着懸在會客室中的圖畫，對於我的加入，僅隨意的瞥了一眼：可是我這下過磨礪功夫的「老」面皮反不自然起來，窗外的學生，每一羣出去，定在會客室門口。探望這末一眼，而且更是那樣的神秘，微微一笑之後，和她們的同伴耳語等舉動，我好像做了一件什麽　心的事，背對着窗，再也不敢返過頭來。這時候惟一的希望我的朋友早點出來，却没有勇氣向甬道盡頭着去。　　「趙，你的在會客室裏等着」。忽然這末粗大的一聲從背後送來，我斜過眼去，一位穿運動衣藍球鞋的女將，向那邊招手，同時對抽捲烟的西裝少年點點頭出門去了。西裝少年抛了烟尾，搶步出會客室，我像看戲似的跟着出來，忘了自己是没有那樣自然態度的雛兒。　　那邊走來的一位女性，大概是所謂趙了，脱去了國貨旗袍，换上時裝新衫，遠遠地就笑着，那西裝少年迎步上去，再並着肩一對新夫婦似的走出校去。　　我目送着他們，就站在會客室門口。被一位大亨見了在門外哼進來「等等又不來，再等也不來」。她過意從我身前走過，對我笑着重復的哼那兩句調調兒。　　一位女學生對着一個陌生的男子能從容的調笑，我眞拜服她的本領，然而我一時的手足無措，被裏面的兩位仁兄也笑了起來。　　我的朋友出來的時候，連說「對不起」，我想我的「老」碰翻在「小」的手中，豈是對不起能夠補償的？少女的摩登生活  寳膺　　這里開展的塲面，是一間極盡富麗的臥房。那位柳綫的眉毛，臉袋長長的少女，坐在沙發椅上，呆望着手里香烟的烟圈，漸漸擴大，消散。驀時鐘嘡嘡三下了，她欠了一欠腰，接着台上的電話鈴也響了，一陣清脆的皮鞋和地板接吻聲，她接着話筒：　　「哈囉」「你……王，昨天謝你……不要俏皮的，不許說……噢！停一會給你電話……好咧！再會……我打你嘴巴……」　　她恢復坐了，呆呆的，怔怔的，她想王是Ｘ校的高材生，是一個少年老成，他有健美的的心，他知道愛，他會一切的玩意兒，可惜没多錢！老媽送來朱行長的名片，請她七點鐘一品香叙餐。她又呆呆的怔怔的，　想四點半到車站接表兄，七點鐘王約到卡爾登，再有朱的叙餐，朱有錢的，不過三十多歳了，老了，不知道女人一切的。　　正是她的芳心忐忑着，像考試不出，任憑絞盡腦汗，也想不出。這時又繼續着鈴鈴鈴電話來了！這是張，請她五點鐘到大光明，晚飯後到大滬。這時她的靈魂，被張奪去了，她露出微微的笑靨，他是西裝畢挺，ＸＸＸ大學生，家里很有錢，可以給她一生的榮華，一輩子也用不完，她迷迷胡胡的像夢去了，夢見張的温存，洋錢……　　「小姐，張家小爺的汽車來了，先請小姐去！」！老媽在呌着　　她欣欣不禁的跳起來，丢了烟尾，换上一九三四年歐化的新裝，一時畫眉，塗粉，點唇，忙個不了。門外汽車催促着嗚嗚的呌，她手忙脚亂的化裝術，在大的着衣鏡里，像跳着徼步舞，（完）自我職業介紹　　吕君建，廣東人，年二十三，大學程度，中英文精通，熟悉簿記打字，現欲求一相當職位，薪金不計，通信處北四川路永樂坊六十六號三樓。游戲文頭奬之喜  愼敏　　今日何日　恭喜發財　　航空奬券　十時開彩　　撥冗惠臨　法界逸園　　人才濟濟　擠擠不堪　　容光焕發　必得横財　　引領仰望　精神百倍　　興高彩烈　想得頭彩　　所購號數　牢記心坎　　叮鈴叮鈴　銅球摇轉　　滴瀝滴瀝　號碼揭開　　台上開彩　臺下喝彩　　倘使頭奬　尚未售出　　重新再摇　特奬來哉　　得中頭奬　眞正海外　　歡天喜地　時來運來　　麥克麥克　腰纒萬貫　　可造洋樓　可購地産　　可坐汽車　可納姨太　　天字商號　可開幾爿　　登時立刻　竟做老板　　這種福氣　前世修來　　最要關子　秘而不宣　　拜托洋友　代領奬欵　　萬無一失　不會觸穿　　如此辦法　定可保險　　無人覬覦　無人唾涎　　萬妥萬當　安富延年　　失望朋友　却又可憐　　惟願諸君　不必懊悔　　靜待時期　百二十天　　下次恭喜　希望無邊　　　人君子　　興　來現代名人書畫　王德川先生畫（略歷）　　王君德川名夀增浙之武義人擅書工畫花卉山水而外墨梅尤爲特長戲劇戰爭與和平（五七）（四幕劇）  凌鶴　　第四幕　　往何處去？第一塲　　排長：嗅，眞是嗎？　　青年丙：眞的，我們不到義勇軍裏面來，走到什麽地方去呀？兄弟們，我們現在没有路走，我們没有國，　　表年：對極了。我們没有了家，我們没有飯吃，這都是漢奸勾結日帝國主義害了我們的。現在我們祇有一個辦法，大家肩起槍來，和日帝國主義拚命。漢奸賣國，可是我們要拿我們的鮮血來收復我們的失地。　　青年乙：同時交們也要打漢奸，打賣國賊。　　排長：好的，只要諸位有决心，我們非常歡迎。這樣擴大我們的隊伍。老實說，現在救國救民族就全靠我們年青人。只有我們的力量，才可以打倒壓迫階級，收復失地。　　兵甲：歡迎，歡迎青年們加入義勇軍。　　青年丙：可是還有一點，聽說現在不是有人組織華東共和國嗎？我們一定要連絡他們，才有辦法。　　排長：那當然，現在我們這隊伍已經和他們努力發生直接關係的，這還消說麽。　　少女：哥哥，你不能去。　　青年：爲什麽？　　少女：你去了，我們的家怎麽辦呢？　　青年：我們的家，我們還有家麽？　　少女：那末你丢下母親和我怎麽辦呢？不是要餓死麽？　　青年：餓死，難道我在家你們就不餓死麽？我們只有打倒了我們的敵人才有飯吃。　　少女：那末我也去。　　兵戊：你也去你女人到軍隊裏幹嗎呀？　　少女：我　你們燒燼我給你個補　　，　　兵甲：哈哈，好的。打帝國主義是不分男女的。　　兵丙：一點也不錯。剛才那一個日本兵也是這麽說，他們日本的女工們，都有了組織，爲了反對日帝國主義，她們都是和男人們一條心的。我們歡迎被壓迫的婦女加入義勇軍！　　兵士戊：哈哈，有女人在一道，那末我們打仗就更有意思啦！　　少女：呸！（嗔嬌的。）　　青年丙：可是我們的槍呢？槍不夠怎麽辦呢？　　青年乙：槍不是還有嗎，上次我們埋在土裏的，去挖出來得了。　　青年丙：那幾根夠什麽用。　　排長：那你别急，天門山連人帶馬埋在土裏的有一百多，一會兒翻出來不全好用了嗎？　　青年：對啦，剛才那一個翻天覆地的聲音，我們就全忘了嗎？（遠處有熙攘的喊聲。）　　兵丙：聽他們在嚷着什麽。　　聲：他媽的，想不到三爺家裏還有這末些麵，今天也讓我們大家好好的吃一頓飽的。　　聲：那些田契借據全燒掉了嗎？　　聲：那當然囉，誰還跟他客氣。　　青年乙：哦，他們是從三大爺家裏來，……哼，到這兒來了。　　青年：哦！也有這末一天！　　（一大羣男婦老幼擠上來。）　　青年：（站在高處）請大家靜一靜，聽我說幾句話。今天我們是大膽的幹了一些了不起的事情了

<p>電影專刊雪爾薇薛妮的談話　聲明脱離派拉蒙的理由　病體支離難以繼續工作  引西　　「我並不是反叛。我亦不是意氣用事。我並不相信搗亂拆臺的把戲。我的所以離開派拉蒙，不和希佛萊合演「福至心靈，」祗有一個理由，就是我身體太壞了，不能支持下去了。我將來養好身體之後，仍舊要回派拉蒙的，而派拉蒙亦正等着我回去演第二張片子呢。」　　以上係「蝴蝶夫人」主角，雪爾薇薛妮，親口告訴一位「銀幕」電影雜誌的女記者的話。當雪爾薇宣布脱離派拉蒙之後，大家都猜想着這位柔順可愛的女子，亦染到了明星們的流行病，不滿於派給她的工作，而發生反抗了。當然雪爾薇薛妮自從「蝴蝶夫人」成功，已經是位赫赫的大明星，她一定不願意再降格而去做一個配角。於是就有許多人認她的病是一種「政治作用的病。」不過據「銀幕」的女記者所說的，雪爾薇薛妮和她談話的時候，雪爾薇確是病體支離；她自己雖說已經比前幾個禮拜好了些，可是她還是面無血色，骨瘦如柴，兩隻藍色的眼睛，覺得更大些。她是非有長期的休養不可。　　雪爾薇薛妮的病，是一種奇特的，很少見的病。她的口涎腺發生了一種變態，能使口涎硬化，結成石質。她這病已經有了三年，體康亦一天一天的弱了。最近她經過一次手續，將那些石質割了出來。派拉蒙公司還催促她，不許她休息，但是他們不知道雪爾薇薛妮這次的動手續，已經是第三次了。　　「前兩次施用手續，他們一句話都没有，雪爾薇薛妮說，「因爲那兩次係在兩張片子的當中，並没有妨碍工作。當我演Ｌadies　of　the　Big　House　的時候，我發了一次病，休息了兩天，以後就繼續工作了。等到那張片子演完之後，就開割了一次。第二次是在演完ＴheMiracle　Ｍan之後，那次是在我左牙床上開的刀。最近我拍演「福至心靈」Ｔhe　Way　to　Love，老病又發了，並且很厲害。她忍了痛苦，工作，五天。攝影師祗可以拍她面龐的一面，我還繼續着工作。最後我的醫生說不割不興了，所以我就在七月十四日開了刀。隔了十多天，派拉蒙公司派了好幾個醫生來診治我，斷定我的病狀。但是他們很膚淺的看視了一下，就回去報告說她不久就可以回公司工作，於身體無多大防碍。但是我兩臉腫得高高的。倘使我是個打字的，或者我可以工作；但是我是女演員，呌我這種形狀，連說話多說不連牽，怎樣去拍電影呢？　　「我的私人醫生告訴我必須長期休養一下。還有一樣，我的病躭擱得太久了，將來恐怕有麻煩。還有各種危險，或者裏面的石頭，没有去凈；或者開割之後，微菌侵到裏面，以致潰爛。要是這樣，醫生就不得不在我臉上開刀，我臉上就會有一個永久的大口子。我想到了，心寒了，因爲我的影戲生活亦就完了，臉上帶了一個疤亦太不好看。但是在紐約，没有專門研究這病症的醫生。聽說紐約大學的牙科主任對於這種病，還有些經騐，我想請他替我診治一下。」觀衆意見「春潮」中的幾個缺點  心如　　（一）嚴玉瑛用遺掉手帕的妙計，重入其表兄的房中，乘機與他約會。那時，她明知她的未婚夫在外邊等候着她，她絕不會那樣從容不迫的偎傍着他，靜靜的等候着他的應諾，至少得要表現出她當時倉卒和急遽的狀態，如蹙眉，搓手，或攀住其表兄的肩膀亂摇…等，以催促他。　　（二）玉瑛經過了千辛萬苦，在大雪紛飛中到天津去找國華，這情勢是多麽的嚴重，應該怎樣才可以表現出她的失望，悲憤；而她却在一跌之後，便不見她的踪跡，而無聲無嗅的回到她的家中去了。　　（三）老僕人去天津找國華，很巧的就在一家飯館内找到了！在情理上講來，他不辭勞苦的跑到天津去，惟一的目的原是要找國華回上海來的，可是在國華狂飮中却輕輕的掩飾過去了，使人不明白他們到底是怎樣分手的？而且國華到底爲什麽原故不回到玉瑛身邊去？　　（四）那貴婦人的家中，絕不容易闖進去的，而國華却毫不費力的由一個窗子中鑽了進去，這未免有些不合實情吧！　　（五）國華旣用槍打死媚梨，爲甚不逃去？或用槍用殺，（其實他在這時自殺，倒是很好的結局呢！）而却打電話給公安局，情願去嘗那鐵窗風味呢？　　（六）李麗等說話，不應該那樣呆板，像在講演一樣。「春潮」  沙蕾　　（上略）在這張片子裏，第一使我感到滿意的是國産「鶴鳴通」的成功，發音非常清晰。其次是一顆新星李麗的發現，她初上銀幕，居然會把很難飾的蕩婦角色演得那樣自然，確非易事。其餘袁叢美，也表演得很好。高占非似乎太呆板些。王人美有點過火，可是他倆都是在十分努力地做。攝影和佈置還不錯。總之，這張片子是值得一看的。　　鄭應時一身兼編劇和導演，委實勞苦功高，但有些地方不無毛病。譬如國華在天津寫信給玉瑛時，先寫「玉瑛女士」，然後改爲「玉瑛吾愛」，其實應當先寫「玉瑛表妹」，因爲世間的表兄妹，决没有稱呼「先生」或「女士」的。媚梨一愛上國華，就把自己的丈夫馬湘逐出門外，也不大近人情，不如屠格湮夫的春潮原著中將他寫成只知喝酒，不管别事爲妥。玉瑛因生活壓迫，好容易跑到了天津，然而她不肯在金公館門口多等一會了，没有看到國華便回來了，這非但空勞往返，並且表示出她這次的北上没有抱着怎樣大的决心。　　在春潮原著中，全書充滿着一種淡淡的哀愁，而不失爲一幕深刻動人的悲劇。在這張片子裏，却把它改成流血，死亡，坐獄的嚴重事件，可是悲劇的成分，反不如春潮原著深刻，這乃勞而無功的。中國的電影大都認爲非大團圓不足以算喜劇，非大流血，大死亡，不能稱爲悲劇，絕對是一種誤解或膚淺。（下略）　　演員方面，除了高占非之外，不能使人完全的滿意，譬如王人美，她表演一個活潑快樂的女性，是再適合也没有的，可是在悲哀的場所，她却失敗了，如本片中到天津去尋表哥時和臨終時，都不能深刻地表演出來。李麗的飾一風流的蕩婦，還算稱職，但也有不少地方却未免矯揉造作，秦虹雲在酒店中遇到高時，說的話太多，太高深，表情却嫌不足，馬湘簡直是一個不速之客，因爲他每一次的出現，都使大家不知道是怎樣來的。飾醫生的化裝技術太壞，使人一望而知是假的。袁叢美我們知道他扮反派小生是很適合的，可是這一次却並没有成功。（下略）「春潮」我評  菲　　看完了「春潮」，心頭覺得非常的空虚。　　「春潮」，在意識上是失敗了的，在技巧却不能說是没有相當的成功，雖然還不能使人十分滿意。　　導演技巧的高妙，是值得稱道的，處處可以看到，如國華和玉瑛的幻想的顯露，玉瑛在旅館中的找尋手帕等，均能給觀衆以喜悦。　　置景，攝影的活潑和美麗，在國産中幾屬罕見，可惜有許多地方如假的雪景等，却因偶然的疏忽而露了馬脚，還有些地方不清楚，也是美中不足。銀海談叢攝影塲裏道具的一部份  仲琴　　攝影塲裏有許多東西是我們所不知道的。這是一位英國新聞記者到好萊塢去看到的幾點。當然這是極微小的幾點，然而亦很有趣。　　在攝影塲裏最使人注目的就是許多長短不齊的鏡箱。一共可分爲四種：一種好像高帽子，足有四尺高；一種有短矮的三脚架祇有幾寸高；一種有五尺長的三脚架還有一種下面好像一輛汽車，可以很自由的左右前後推動。這幾種東西，在英國是没有看見過。　　在一個壁角裏有一架東西放着。有一個人在工作，他拿一張一張全身的影片放進去，拿出來巳攝成了半身的影片。另外有一張一張没有佈景的一段影片，他改成有桌子椅子等佈景的影片了。　　那邊是製作慢動作影片的一部分。所謂慢動作，就是從極快的動作拍攝下來的影片化成慢而清晰的影片。我們常常看見運動影片在美國連極快的球在空中轉動都能夠很清楚的看見。原來是用這種方法中製成的。慢動作影片的反面是快動作影片。那是我們所常看見的。　　在攝影塲的地上有一條一條像網球塲上的界線一般的東西，上面還劃着尺寸。留心看去，有三個界限；一個寫着，Ｃose一個寫着Ｍedium一個寫着Ｌong原來這多是拍攝近距離較大的界限，可以拍攝演員的面目一部分，一個是拍半身的，而最遠的一個是拍攝一羣人或許多人在一室中的界限。　　還有一樣希奇的東西，是懸掛着的許多半透明的佈景，是用薄的Ｃelluloid所製成的。演員可以站立在佈景的背面用攝影機拍攝，這種佈景的新奇，在歐洲没有見過，然而牠的製造手績一定是很難的。來函照登　　主筆先生大鑒敬啟者頃讀昨日（二十九日）貴報「電影專刊」所載電影短訊數則不勝駭異如「龔稼農徐莘園王夢石聞將脱離明星」等消息未識何自而來竊思我國影壇年來外受舶來片之侵略内受不景氣影響處此風雨飄摇之秋正宜各自奮發在出品方面謀藝術之競爭以期挽救將倒之狂瀾詎知少數同行不此之圖祗以卑劣之宣傳拉人之惡技肆行破壞長此以往我電影界縱不爲外力所打倒亦將傾軋而滅亡言念及此能不痛心憶本年春間某公司亦曾有搜羅胡蝶等四大金剛之流言並具名蓋章投函某報斷言三月一日起胡蝶卽爲某公司之基本演員而半年以來胡蝶匪特未受該公司之聘且仍與敝公司續訂長約繼續表演又敝公司演員龔稼農王獻齋蕭英譚志遠徐莘園謝雲卿王夢石諸人均已於本年九月三十日繼訂合同三年僅高梨痘黄君甫二人未與續訂事實爲最好之鐵證空言徒貽譏於識者兹特專函奉上敬祈於「電影專刊」欄内予以更正無任盼禱此頌箸安　　明星影片公司謹啟十月三十日電影小說　桃李芬芳　Ｐaddy　the　Next　Best　Thing（九）  幸生　　那天晚上潘弟的舊房子裡，開著盛大的跳舞會，那是特爲歡歡迎潘弟開的。那天晚上，鐘鐘響了，正是十二點，一切的音樂突然停止了。大家賓客們不約而同的齊集在樓梯前面。鐘慢慢地打了十二下，樓梯上端，潘弟出來了，她穿了她親母手製的衣服。同時音樂奏起「歡迎回故鄉」的音調。潘弟從樓梯上一步一步地走下來，大家又不約而同的喊着「歡迎潘弟回家！歡迎潘弟回家！恭喜潘弟聖誕！」　　在樓梯最低級，賈克一隻手接住了潘弟，一隻手拿了一大捲紙。他喊着：「歡迎你回家，潘弟！」潘弟覺科有些奇怪，她問道：「家？回家？」賈克道：「還就是你的家，連所有的東西，一切在内，完全和從前一樣。這是你聖誕節的禮物。這裏一摇這是契紙。」潘弟眼瞪着賈克說不出話來。她的眼睛忽然看見了勞倫斯勃萊克。她明白了這都是他的把戲。她突然掉轉頭來，向樓上奔上去了。等到賈克想拉住她，已經來不及了。賈克祇好笑道：「你們看我控制女人的本事都厲害呀！」　　音樂又奏了起來，大家捉對義兒跳著舞，地板上塞滿了翩𦒘的舞伴。勞倫斯勃萊克趁這個當兒，上樓去尋潘弟去了。潘弟正將走進她的舊房間。勞倫斯把她拉住了。他央求着道：潘弟，你爲什麽生氣呢？」潘弟恨恨地道：「我知道，這房子是你買下來的。」勞倫斯道：「我這房子，是替你買的」。潘弟將一捲契紙塞在勞倫斯的手裏，她說：「我不能受這個。」勞倫斯道：「這契紙上寫的是你的名字。這是你的財産，你的，永遠是你的……等到我和你百年之後，這所房子還在這裏存留着，我們的兒女還住在這裏……現在愛琳已經結了婚了。你可以没有什麽不放心的事了。祗要你能明白我怎樣的愛你的，寳貝……」　　「祇要你知道我當初是怎樣愛你的……」潘弟自己亦不知道的說了出來。　　「潘弟」勞倫斯還有些疑信參半，難道潘弟自己供出她的愛他了嗎！他兩臂把她接了過來；她的頭緊緊貼在他的胸口。潘弟道：「你明白了嗎？這樣就是我最恨你的地方！」（完）</p>

<h3>The Ministry of Finance Has Completed Its Closure; Routine Official Business Has Been Suspended; Awaiting the New Minister of Finance to Take Over; There are Rumors of Zhang Shouyong and Chen Shudu Being Appointed as New Vice Ministers</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) An official from the Ministry of Finance stated: "On the 26th, a telegram was received from Minister Song ordering the expedited completion of the closure. All departments and sections have now completed their tasks and are awaiting handover. Furthermore, Vice Ministers Zou Lin and Li Tiao-sheng have both submitted their resignations to the Executive Yuan. It is said that the new vice ministerial appointments are internally decided with Zhang Shouyong as Political Vice Minister and Chen Shudu as Administrative Vice Minister, but Zhang Shouyong has not fully agreed." (30th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Since Song Ziwen's resignation from the Ministry of Finance, all departments, divisions, offices, and sections have been processing the closure. It was completed on the 30th. The party, government, and military expenses for October have also been fully disbursed. All routine official business of each department and section has been suspended, awaiting Kong Xiangxi to send personnel to take over. It is rumored that all officials above the rank of Senior Appointment in the ministry will resign, and the resignation letters of Political Vice Minister Zou Lin and Administrative Vice Minister Li Tiao-sheng have been submitted to the Executive Yuan. It was originally said that Kong Xiangxi would arrive at the ministry on November 1st to take office. However, according to personnel at the Ministry of Finance, Kong is currently very busy in Shanghai negotiating everything with the banking community, and it is feared that he will not be able to arrive on schedule, possibly delaying for a day or two. (30th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The opinion of political circles here is that Song Ziwen's resignation will not significantly affect the central government. Therefore, the central government's policy toward Japan will not change due to Song's resignation. (29th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Two Vice Ministers of the Ministry of Finance, Zou Lin and Li Tiaosheng, Request to Resign</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The resignation letters of Zou Lin, Political Vice Minister of the Ministry of Finance, and Li Tiao-sheng, Administrative Vice Minister, to the Executive Yuan. Zou's letter stated: "Presenting this petition for resignation to make way for more capable individuals. I, Lin, was appointed by the National Government as Political Vice Minister of the Ministry of Finance, with limited talent and a heavy responsibility, constantly feeling as if treading on thin ice. Since the September 18th Incident, foreign troubles and internal worries have relentlessly tormented us. I have accompanied Minister Song in supporting the situation and勉應時需 (勉應時需 is a four character classical phrase which roughly translates to 'reluctantly responding to the needs of the time'). Although we have temporarily overcome the difficulties, national affairs remain serious. Assisting in policy-making requires great talent. I believe myself to be inadequate and unable to fulfill the role, and urgently request that this petition be forwarded to the National Government, relieving me of my current position and appointing more capable individuals to take over, so as to avoid making mistakes. All reasons for resignation are hereby submitted to your esteemed Yuan for examination and implementation." Li's letter stated: "Presenting this petition for resignation to make way for more capable individuals. I, Tiao-sheng, was appointed by the National Government as Administrative Vice Minister of the Ministry of Finance. I believe myself to be inadequate and unable to alleviate the current difficulties. However, with the country facing hardship, every citizen has a responsibility. I have strived to work with sincerity and unity, upholding Minister Song's handling of ministry affairs, working diligently day and night, hoping not to make mistakes. Currently, internal and external troubles are endlessly recurring. Finance is of utmost importance to the national economy and people's livelihood. Being unable to fulfill my duties, I feel deeply guilty. I urgently request that this petition be forwarded to the National Government, relieving me of my current position and appointing more capable individuals to take over, so as to avoid making mistakes. All reasons for resignation are hereby submitted to your esteemed Yuan for examination and implementation." (30th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<h3>Huang and Zhao Discuss Mongolian Affairs with Fu and Others After Arriving in Guihua; Receive Kings and Others from the Yikezhao League to Solicit Opinions; To Go to Bailingmiao Within a Week to Guide Autonomy; Xu Tingyao Goes to Sui at Huang's Invitation</h3>
<p>Guihua: Huang Shaoxiong, Zhao Pilian, Fu Zuoyi, and others discussed Mongolian affairs at length on the afternoon of the 30th. Huang stated that going to Bailingmiao was not to convene a meeting and the travel date had not yet been determined. They are currently listening to opinions on Mongolian affairs and will issue a statement in a few days. Zhao stated that he had only met with the king and Mongolian representatives to talk. He will still travel to Bailingmiao with Huang. Fu stated that the talk of Inner Mongolian autonomy having a background is a thing of the past. Now that Huang has arrived in Sui, Mongolian affairs can be discussed and decided. He currently has no opinion to express. Li Songfeng stated that Huang's trip will be in accordance with the central government's established guidelines, inspect the local situation, and seek a proper solution to resolve Mongolian affairs. (30th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>Guihua: Huang Shaoxiong is expected to depart for Mongolia within a week. Kings, nobles, and representatives from various leagues and banners of Inner Mongolia have gathered at Bailingmiao, preparing to hold a large meeting after Huang and Zhao arrive, inviting Huang to attend and guide the direction of Inner Mongolian autonomy. (30th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>Guihua: Fu Zuoyi stated that Inner Mongolian autonomy is not very serious. After Huang arrives, all problems should be resolved. Currently, only King De and King Da remain in Bailingmiao, while other kings and nobles are scattered. The Panchen Lama is currently residing in Bailingmiao. The main purpose of the kings and representatives of the leagues and banners who recently went to Bailingmiao was to pay their respects to the Panchen Lama. The league chief of the Yikezhao League of Sui Province participated in the autonomy conference. Only a few banners of the Ulanqab League sent representatives to participate. On the afternoon of the 29th, Huang and Zhao returned the visit to Fu Zuoyi. They then received King A and others from the Yikezhao League in the headquarters to solicit opinions. At 4:30 PM, Huang, Zhao, and Fu went to the racetrack to watch the autumn championship. At 5:30 PM, they returned to the headquarters together. In the evening, Fu held a banquet at the Suiyuan Hotel to welcome Huang, Zhao, and others. (30th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>Zhangjiakou: Huang Shaoxiong spoke to the Mongolian Chief Administrator and fellow villagers in Zhangyuan, saying that Outer Mongolia first achieved autonomy and then independence, and that Korea's separation from China was similar. The reason why the central government cannot approve autonomy this time is that it does not understand the true situation. After the inspection and慰撫 (comfort and placate), it will be possible to organize a body representing the will of the Mongolian people and engage in Mongolian affairs. After Huang finished speaking, Zhuote Bazaapu expressed to Huang that Mongolia and China have a relationship of thousands of years, and Mongolia and China are like the division between the northern and southern provinces of the mainland. However, the Mongolian people are nomadic and need vast pastures to maintain their livelihood. Now, nine out of ten pastures have been reclaimed. The few remaining pastures cannot maintain the livelihood of the Mongolian people. Compelled by circumstances, they began to demand autonomy, without any other background. (30th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Xu Tingyao went to Sui by special train on the morning of the 30th at Huang's invitation, to enter Mongolia together. (30th Special Telegram)</p>
<h3>Mongolians in Beiping Oppose the Entry of Zhangjia into Mongolia</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Inner and Outer Mongolian Association of Fellow Villagers in Beiping sent a telegram opposing Zhangjia's entry into Mongolia, and also telegraphed the central government, opposing Yan Chang's Frontier Administration Department. (30th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Enke Batu telegraphed Beijing stating that the report that the Mongolian Association of Fellow Villagers in Beiping had telegraphed the central government to prevent Zhangjia from going to Mongolia to宣化 (propagate doctrines) was unknown to Enke and others. It was clearly a small number of people using the name to maliciously attack. (30th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhangjia previously sent Li Shoushan and Gong Shushi to Zhangyuan to inspect the various leagues and banners. Li telegraphed Beiping to report that he had arrived at various banners and parts of the Xilingol League to investigate. Gong telegraphed from Bailingmiao to report that he had passed through the Naihe Banner of Suiyuan to Bailingmiao and made contact with various parties concerned. Zhang's trip to Mongolia will be decided after Li, Gong, and others report the details of their inspection. (30th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) King De's representative Bao Yueqing arrived in Beiping and reported to the Mongolian fellow villagers on the progress of the autonomy conference. (30th Special Telegram)</p>
<h3>The Inner Mongolian Autonomy Movement; Three Meetings Were Held in Bailingmiao; Remarks of the Representatives of the Twelve Banners of Chahar</h3>
<p>Zhangjiakou: Temuer Boluot, representative of the twelve banners of Chahar, went to Bailingmiao to participate in the autonomy conference. He returned to Zhang yesterday and stated that on October 9th, the Inner Mongolian autonomy conference was attended by the league chief of the Ulanqab League, the deputy league chief of the Yun League, the deputy league chief of the Xilingol League, King Zhuo of the Abaga Right Banner, King Guo of the Sunit Banner, representatives of various banners of the Ujumqin League, representatives of the Tümed Banner, Temuer, and more than 50 people including the association managers and台旗 (high ranking banner official). It was resolved that an Inner Mongolian autonomous government should be established under the leadership of the National Government, and more than 20 members of the drafting committee for the organic law of the autonomous government were appointed, and the meeting adjourned. The second general meeting was held on October 15th to review the draft of the organic law of the Inner Mongolian autonomous government. The participants were the same as before. The third meeting was held on October 23rd. The participants were the same as before. The organic law was passed and the chairman of the government committee was appointed, etc., and it was decided that the number of committee members would be 11, with two each from Xilingol League, Ulanqab League, Yikezhao League, Chahar, Tümed, and one from Alxa. Since I have been in charge of politics, I have made no achievements, and I am deeply ashamed. However, at a time when Mongolia is in crisis, if we do not seek self-salvation and save the country, 沈淪 (degeneration) will be imminent. In order to save Inner Mongolia from fire and water and rescue the country from danger, although there are many misunderstandings outside, we will never stop due to the instigation, alienation, or division of others. Life can be dispensable, but autonomy must be implemented. King De stated that the central government treats Mongolian affairs as 化外 (outside civilization), and the livelihood of the Mongolian people has been almost completely deprived, resulting in the economic decline of the Mongolian people and everything lagging behind. Red Russia is watching to the north, and violent Japan is coveting to the east. In order to save Mongolia and consolidate national defense, autonomy must be implemented. This kind of movement is based on the teachings of Sun Yat-sen and the laws of the central government. If Inner Mongolia does not implement autonomy, it will not be able to advance simultaneously with other ethnic groups in the world. (30th Special Telegram)</p>
<h3>Japan's Economic Aggression Focuses on the Yangtze River Area</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to news from the Jiji Shimpo, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Trade Bureau believes that due to the lack of control over trade with China, the idea of forming an export association for China is becoming more and more powerful. At the same time, measures to contain the anti-Japanese goods movement in China are being emphasized. Also, when the export association is established, the focus is on the Yangtze River coast, so the progress of Yangtze River trade is highly anticipated. (30th Special Telegram)</p>
<h3>The Attitude of the Bandits in Fucheng Remains Stubborn; Negotiations for Surrender Have Yielded No Results; Old Mouse Secretly Returns to Fucheng; Yin Tao Arrives in Tianjin to Prepare for the Establishment of a Supervisory Commissioner's Office</h3>
<p>Changli: Old Mouse, under the protection of a certain party, secretly returned to Fucheng via Haiyang Town. Since the bandits retreated into the city, they have continued to resist stubbornly.

Zhang Hongnian, the 12th company commander of Dou's unit, entered the city to negotiate surrender. Representatives from Zhou's and Liu's units also entered the city. However, the attitude of the bandits is very stubborn. Zhang Xiguang specially sent Section Chief Li to conduct concrete negotiations, and brought a large number of persuasion letters to urge the bandits to surrender as soon as possible. More than 100 members of the Japanese garrison went to our position to observe, and the rumors in Fucheng were inaccurate. (30th Special Telegram)</p>

<h3>Jin Shuren is Arrested in Nanjing; Yesterday He Visited Various Important People, But They All Refused to See Him; He Was Arrested and Escorted to the Police Hall; The Case of Illegally Signing Treaties is Under Investigation</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Jin Shuren, the former chairman of Xinjiang, was the chief of Xinjiang for several years, and his infamous deeds were well-known. Moreover, he illegally signed treaties with foreigners, betraying national sovereignty and humiliating the country. The compatriots in Xinjiang were all indignant. He recently went to Jiangxi from Tianjin to pay his respects to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, hoping that there was still room for maneuver. He arrived in Beijing from Jiangxi on the 29th. On the morning of the 30th, he still paid his respects to Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum. In the afternoon, he took a carriage to visit various important people in Beijing, but they all refused to see him. In the afternoon of the 30th, the Executive Yuan resolved to arrest Jin and ordered the Ministry of Justice to prosecute him according to law. Jin was arrested on the evening of the 30th and escorted to the police hall to await legal action. Jin is a native of Daohe, Gansu.

<h3>How to Reach the Road to Prosperity?</h3>
<p>— You</p>
<p>The United States is currently deeply mired in a long-standing financial panic, its difficulties persistent and difficult to overcome. Then there was a Roosevelt, who took it upon himself to be the savior of prosperity for the world. On March 4th of this year, he closed the banks of all forty-eight states, convened the Washington Talks, abandoned the gold standard, and refused to agree to the exchange rate stabilization negotiations of the London Conference. It seemed that he could support the sky with one hand. However, examining the process, there were few real effects. Recently, on the night of the 22nd of this month, he broadcast to the nation, announcing a monetary policy to raise prices and achieve final victory. And the methods he proposed were: first, to buy newly mined gold domestically, so that the commodity value of the "dollar" would decrease; second, when necessary, to throw out "dollars" in the world market, such as London and Paris, and buy foreign currencies, so that the exchange value of the "dollar" would decrease. In short, he hoped to build a bridge on the value of properly managed currency to cross to the road to final prosperity. But can the bridge he built be successfully traversed without any danger?</p>
<p>Indeed, after Roosevelt's policies were announced, the governments of the major powers of London and Paris were all alarmed and vigilant. In order to prohibit the import of devalued goods, to protect shrinking profits, and to facilitate the sale of mountains of accumulated products, everyone took the initiative. France is prepared to defend itself against the United States when it buys gold on the world market. (Paris Havvas Telegram, 25th of this month) Not only that, France, for constitutional reasons, has to retain the right to automatically protect national interests in tariff matters and has notified the Secretariat of the League of Nations. (Reuters Paris Telegram, 26th of this month) Britain already has an exchange rate stabilization fund of 350 million pounds as a preparation. Therefore, the methods of dealing with the situation in Britain and France, whether building high tariff walls or depressing currency values, can be advanced or retreated with ease, and the means are very strong. Even if Washington's method of "dollar" devaluation can manipulate the value of pure gold per ounce in "dollars," how can the various obstacles ahead be broken down to reach this bridge to prosperity?</p>
<p>Moreover, the loss of prosperity in European and American countries has its own fundamental contradictions. From January to June of this year, the French production index increased from 78 to 88 (1913 as the base year), the British increased from 89 to 91 (1924 as the base year), and the American increased from 58 to 88 (1923 to 1925 average as the base year). With goods so accumulated and markets so narrow, how can this current crisis of overproduction be overcome to reach the other shore?</p>
<p>Looking at Roosevelt's measures since taking office, he is worthy of being a great magician. But in these six months, prices have risen. In terms of agricultural products, they have increased from 43 to 54 (1926 as the base year). In terms of handicrafts, they have also increased from 67 to 69 (1926 as the base year). The suffering of farmers and workers cannot be alleviated in any way. As for suppressing various strike waves, it also takes a lot of effort. Today, many political leaders in various countries of the world are using their special and arbitrary means to build this bridge of prosperity with painstaking efforts. However, there is no record of anyone who can lay the foundation stone firmly and unshakably. Therefore, Roosevelt's policy of buying gold at home and abroad, saying that it can depreciate the value of the "dollar" and stabilize it to reach the road to prosperity, we do not dare to believe that he has such a magical skill of changing fates.</p>
<h3>Roosevelt's New Monetary Policy Will Trigger International Currency War; US President Decides to Buy Gold Abroad; France May Be Forced to Abandon the Gold Standard; Whether Treasury Secretary Woodin Will Resign Becomes a Mystery of the Current Situation</h3>
<p>(Washington) It is expected here that if the United States purchases large quantities of gold in foreign markets, it will trigger a war between the US dollar and the French franc, which may result in France being forced to abandon the gold standard. Although the US government has made no indication of the desired gold price in the near future, it has indicated that the Financial Rehabilitation Company will proceed according to the entire plan announced by the US President last week. Today, the US President summoned his financial advisors for consultations, and shortly thereafter, there was talk of beginning to purchase gold abroad in the coming days. Officials did not deny this information, but declined to announce the date, saying that the President stated that he would engage in purchases when necessary. Today, some parties believe that the US President does not want to see the US dollar's price rise, so the Financial Rehabilitation Company will go to the European market and offer a higher gold price to avoid a further rise in the gold price. However, it is heard that European gold standard countries are seeking to raise the gold price to protect their own trade, so they will certainly wage a war against the US action to maintain or further suppress the current price of gold. Therefore, financial experts who previously explained the new gold plan as a moderate inflationary measure are now looking forward to a fierce battle in the foreign gold market. (28th National News Agency)</p>
<p>(Paris) The French financial community points out that President Roosevelt's decision to allow the purchase of gold abroad is a scheme to force the entire country to abandon the gold standard. An unnamed person, speaking on behalf of the Bank of France, said that the United States may not buy much cash, because the United States does not have much deposit in Europe. It is also said that the US President's move makes balancing the budget even more necessary. (30th Reuters)</p>
<p>(London) Washington sources expect that the US purchase of cash abroad will inevitably lead to international currency competition. London public opinion also holds the same view, believing that competition between the US dollar and the British pound is inevitable. The financial reporter of the Daily Express said that other countries intend to cooperate to obstruct the success of President Roosevelt's gold plan, so President Roosevelt has taken this new action. There is now a good basis to believe that the Bank of England and the Bank of France are cooperating with each other, and whenever President Roosevelt raises the domestic gold price, they purchase US dollars. In fact, the value of the US dollar will inevitably fall sooner or later. If the British and French banks are not prepared to speculate heavily on the US dollar, this kind of resistance action will not be possible at present. The only other method is for the British pound to sever its connection with the French franc and indirectly reject the gold standard. The Financial Times said that the US move to buy gold abroad will endanger the stability of other countries' industries and currencies. (29th Reuters)</p>
<p>(Washington) After consulting with his financial advisors today, President Roosevelt approved the purchase of gold overseas. The crowd expected the Gold Deputy Rehabilitation Agency to begin purchasing immediately. It is heard that the US President is greatly disappointed because his major gold policy cannot raise prices. The Washington Post, founded by the former President of the Federal Reserve Bank, Meyer, also admitted the disappointment of the US President's advisors and said that the authorities intend to gradually raise the net gold price to $41.34 per ounce, which is equal to halving the gold content of the US dollar. President Roosevelt's meeting with his advisors lasted for three hours. All attendees strictly maintained confidentiality and did not leak the contents of the meeting, and the statements issued by the White House were also extremely vague, only announcing the names of the attendees and declaring that gold would be purchased overseas. Observers believe that the US gold buying campaign in foreign markets is a step towards managed currency and seeks to control world gold. Others predict that international currency competition will arise. In short, this US move will increase the difficulty of the gold standard. (29th Reuters)</p>
<p>(London) The London foreign exchange market opened today with considerable caution, due to the US decision to purchase gold in the world market. The opening price of the US dollar was $4.82, and the fluctuations were quite rapid. According to news from New York, economists in Washington and Wall Street in New York expect that if the United States deals with currency single-handedly, other countries will take retaliatory action and serious consequences will occur. The United Kingdom will protect its commercial position by using commercial currency methods, and France will ban the export of cash or abandon the gold standard. However, the New York Times learned that when President Roosevelt and his financial advisors gathered at the White House last night, some people advocated continuing consultations with the Bank of England. This proposal can at least be a prelude to the final stability of the Anglo-American exchange rate. The New York Bulletin also said that a cooperation agreement may be established between the US Federal Reserve Bank and the Bank of France. As for how much cash the United States intends to buy, it has not yet been determined. (30th Reuters)</p>
<p>(Washington) A key US government official said today that the US President still wants to continue to implement the credit expansion plan until the original target of $100 million is reached. Although this plan has so far failed to greatly help raise prices, the President believes that it can supplement the gold purchasing policy, so the two plans will proceed simultaneously. The amount of public bonds and other credit expansion activities purchased each week will be increased or decreased as needed by the market. After the US government announced the gold purchasing plan a few days ago, many financial experts predicted that credit expansion would gradually shrink. Judging from the reduction in the amount of public bonds purchased by the Federal Reserve Bank last week, this view seems to be confirmed. According to a key official, the two will still complement each other. (29th National News Agency)</p>
<p>(Washington) The fact that Treasury Secretary Woodin is not in Washington whenever the US Treasury Department makes important decisions has already caused astonishment here. The government has firmly denied the claim that Woodin will resign soon. However, if news reporters question people in the White House and the Treasury Department about this situation, they will often show embarrassment, or give evasive answers, or avoid answering altogether. However, on the day when the fourth round of Liberty Bonds were issued to raise new funds to repay old debts, Woodin was drumming in Philadelphia. Later, when the government announced the new policy of purchasing domestic gold, Woodin was also in New York. In addition, recently, whenever the Treasury Department makes an announcement, it is made by Deputy Treasury Secretary Acheson. Even the negotiations on war debts with the British representative were conducted by Acheson rather than Woodin, which is extremely bizarre. As for the war debt negotiations, Treasury Department officials admitted today that Acheson's progress has been slow because he is busy with domestic currency issues. When Woodin leaves Beijing, Acheson can only meet with the British representative once or twice a week. (28th National News Agency)</p>
<p>(Washington) According to news from the Federal Reserve Board, the US government is now focusing its efforts on releasing the stagnant deposits in closed banks, so that the public can recover $100 million for Christmas shopping, thereby stimulating industry and commerce. Because most of these deposits belong to small depositors, it is expected that after the release, they will be used for spending the year. According to the Currency Administrator, there are currently 5,048 banks operating normally, and only 710 are still closed. The stagnant deposits in these banks total approximately $621,132,000, of which $46,957,000 can be withdrawn without restriction once they reopen. In addition, assistance will be provided to state banks to reopen, so that the stagnant deposits can be released before Christmas. According to the Currency Administrator, of the 8,500 banks that have not joined the Federal Reserve System, more than 3,000 have applied to join insurance deposits. (29th National News Agency)</p>
<p>(New York) A dispatch from the White House to the New York Bulletin stated that the National Recovery Administration is now feeling bewildered and watching the results of the first week of the gold plan. There are rumors of resignations or a general dissolution in the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve Board. It is heard that Undersecretary of the Treasury Acheson offered his legal opinion, but President Roosevelt ignored it when announcing the gold plan. The Washington Post said that President Roosevelt is prepared to announce an immediate reduction in the gold content of the US dollar if his attempts continue to be ineffective. (29th Reuters)</p>
<p>(Washington) Congressional supporters of silver claimed today that if President Roosevelt does not take immediate action to stabilize silver prices, they will meet in mid-November to formulate procedures for a unified action to restore silver prices. It is heard that Senators Thomas, Pittman, Wheeler, and King plan to propose both palliative and fundamental procedures for Congress to pass when Congress reconvenes in January next year. (29th Reuters)</p>
<p>(Washington) The government announced today the organization of the Civilian Housing Construction Agency, stipulating a start-up capital of US$200 million to build low-cost housing nationwide to benefit civilians. (29th Reuters)</p>
<h3>War Debt Negotiations Stalled</h3>
<p>(New York) A dispatch from Washington to the New York Times today stated that after the war debt negotiators met with the US President, discussions on Anglo-American war debts have now been postponed indefinitely. The United Kingdom is willing to pay a quarter of the total amount of war debts, while the United States is asking for three-quarters. It is heard that President Roosevelt intends to wait until the fate of the recovery program is more certain and after US and Russian representative Litvinov discuss Russian debts before discussing this matter further. (29th Reuters)</p>
<h3>Russian Foreign Minister Arrives in Paris</h3>
<p>(Paris) Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov, accompanied by the Director of the Intelligence Department of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Umanov, arrived in Paris at 10:25 this morning and will take a ship to the United States from France. (30th Havas)</p>
<h3>Cuban Government Shaken; Political and Labor Turmoil Approaches</h3>
<p>Havana Cuba is now experiencing another upheaval. Today, the national transportation industry and electricity and water workers all announced a three-day strike. The oil company refused the employees' seventy demands and also announced a shutdown. The government seems unable to control the situation. In addition, the health plan is not being implemented effectively, resulting in a large increase in fever cases, making the difficulties even greater. The cabinet resigned en masse to the President a few days ago, but Dr. San Martin decided to retain it, and at the same time, he is trying to mediate with various parties to organize a government with a semi-parliamentary nature. However, judging from the phenomena, the Cuban government is about to collapse, because the left wing of the Revolutionary Party is now openly saying that it will no longer support the government. It is widely believed that the Cespedes Party will regain power, and it can probably obtain US assistance. (29th Reuters)</p>
<p>Havana The Cuban government announced today that most of the labor agitators detained in recent days have been released, and it is hoped that the general strike scheduled to begin at midnight today will not materialize. The National Confederation of Labor is considering this move by the government, but there is no major statement yet. (29th National News Agency)</p>
<h3>Hitler Bitterly Condemns the Treaty of Versailles; Prefers Isolation to Not Having Equality</h3>
<p>Frankfurt Chancellor Hitler arrived here last night and addressed 20,000 people gathered in the city's auditorium. Another 100,000 people gathered in 75 locations to listen to Hitler's broadcast speech. Hitler bitterly condemned the Treaty of Versailles, saying that this treaty was actually the source of communism. He then said that international relations can never be adjusted based on this malicious treaty. Countries around the world should know that we are also a noble nation and that those who take maintaining honor as their duty, Germany will never sign any agreement that does not fully recognize our demand for equal rights. If countries say that according to what we are currently doing, we will be isolated, then we would rather be isolated and preserve our honor than be in the company of the masses under insulting conditions. There is no other way than this. Hitler concluded by saying, I have no cannons, I can only rely on my patriotic compatriots. You should help me in this struggle for Germany's rights.

<h3>British Reporter to Be Tried</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The Munich correspondent of the British Daily Telegraph, Painter, has been charged with espionage and lèse-majesté and has been sent to Leipzig, where he will be tried by the Supreme Court. The reason for the hasty transfer is that Painter refuses to speak except to the judge. A journalist named Ackermann in Munich, who is accused of conspiracy, has also been arrested. It is heard that he has confessed that the telegrams transmitted by Painter were supplied by him. (30th National News Agency)</p>
<h3>New Balkan Union; Meeting of Romanian and Bulgarian Leaders</h3>
<p>Capital of Romania King Carol of Romania and King Boris of Bulgaria held a meeting this morning. When the boat carrying the Bulgarian royal family arrived in Romanian territory, a salute was fired. The Romanian King, accompanied by Prime Minister Vanda and Foreign Minister Titulescu, went to meet them by boat. The two kings then boarded the Romanian King's boat together and sailed into Romanian territory. The Bulgarian King was accompanied by Prime Minister Muchanov. Romanian public opinion regards the meeting of the two kings as a very important event, because King Alexander of Yugoslavia previously met with the Kings of Romania and Bulgaria separately. Now, the Kings of Romania and Bulgaria have met directly again. The closeness of the three countries in the Balkan Peninsula can be seen from this. (30th Havas)</p>
<h3>Franco-German Saar Dispute</h3>
<p>Saarbrücken The Saar region was originally German territory but was placed under French jurisdiction after the European War. However, in 1935, there will be a referendum for the people to determine whether the region will return to Germany or remain with France. It has recently been discovered here that most of the communists and so-called separatists are holding firearms and have gradually organized intimidation groups in order to disrupt the referendum in the coming year. Therefore, the German and Russian people there are quite alarmed. According to court investigations, these people did not apply to the police authorities for gun licenses in accordance with the law, and the French governing authorities openly used communists and separatists as police officers in the Saar mining area, so that they were all able to carry firearms. This proves that the French authorities' move is actually preparing to disrupt the referendum in the future. However, eight or nine out of ten people in the Saar region are German, and they are attached to their motherland and will never give up their nationality. However, looking to the future, there are crises everywhere, and it is feared that the theory of self-determination will not be able to be implemented safely at that time.

<h3>Liu Wendao Departs for Italy to Take Office</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Liu Wendao, the Chinese Minister to Germany, who was previously transferred to be the Minister to Italy, departed from here for Rome to take office. The Director of the Protocol Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and staff of the Chinese Embassy were all at the station to see him off. (30th Havas)</p>

<h3>Araki Advocates Convening a Far East International Conference; Ministry of Foreign Affairs Believes It Is Difficult to Achieve</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Minister of the Army Araki went to Fukui to inspect the army's large-scale exercise. In Fukui, the Minister of the Army, in order to adjust international relations in the Far East, establish Eastern peace, and make the countries understand Japan's consistent policy on the situation in the Far East, decided to convene a Far East Peace Conference to resolve all disputes in the Far East. The Minister of the Army plans to consult with the naval authorities after returning to Tokyo, and after the military departments reach a consensus, he will advise Prime Minister Saito and Foreign Minister Hirota to convene a Far East Peace Conference in the shortest possible time. The content of the Far East Peace Conference planned by the Minister of the Army is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The 1935 Washington Conference is about to be held, and Japan has many international outstanding issues related to this, so it should actively establish a fundamental policy for Far East peace during this period.</p>
<p>(2) The significance of the Far East Peace Conference for the United Kingdom and the United States is that it is a preparatory meeting to discuss the revision of the London Naval Disarmament Conference and the First Washington Conference.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding relations with Soviet Russia, with the Japan-Russia non-aggression issue as the center, a policy of maintaining peace among Japan, Manchuria, and Russia will be negotiated.</p>
<p>(4) Also discuss non-war treaties, the Nine-Power Treaty, and all political issues in the Far East that are directly and indirectly related to the Far East, in order to calculate the fundamental adjustments of interests among the countries and permanent peace in the Far East.</p>
<p>(5) The Far East Peace Conference will invite representatives from Far Eastern countries such as China, Manchuria, Siam, India, Afghanistan, and Soviet Russia, as well as countries such as the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Italy, Germany, and the Netherlands to participate. (30th Japan Union News Agency)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the plan to convene a Far East Peace Conference announced by Minister of the Army Araki in Fukui on the 29th, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has a very cautious opinion on this. It is heard that the general idea is as follows: Japan's convening of an international conference is a meaningful plan because it reveals to the countries Japan's belief in maintaining peace in the Far East. However, with the Second Washington Conference being held, this matter is already a reality, so it is questionable whether the countries will agree to attend the Far East Conference. Japan's established policy is to handle the Manchurian issue based on its own views and to exclude the interference of third countries in Sino-Japanese issues. If there are opinions that conflict with the Japanese government's established policy at the Second Washington Conference, Japan will resolutely reject them. Therefore, there is no need to anxiously propose convening an international conference now. Also, in fact, whether such a large-scale international conference can be held in this short period of time still needs to be considered. (30th Japan Union News Agency)</p>
<h3>Japanese Military and Financial Cliques Vie for Rights to the South Manchuria Railway; Kwantung Army Thinks of Expanding Its Power</h3>
<p>Ishiomaki Regarding the reorganization of the South Manchuria Railway proposed by the Kwantung Army Special Service Department, the Minseito Party advocates the following: It is not objectionable to make railway transportation independent and to manage other businesses separately. However, if these businesses are completely transferred to the hands of the Kwantung Army, this is entirely fascist politics, and we will resolutely oppose it. (30th Electric Communication Agency)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Seiyukai Party attaches great importance to the Kwantung Army's South Manchuria Railway Reform Plan and the establishment of the Economic Staff Headquarters. The South Manchuria Railway Reform Plan is a matter of life and death for the South Manchuria Railway, and its impact is extremely large. If it is forcibly implemented, it may lead to confrontation between the military and the government, and may cause unexpected results in the entire political situation. We are paying close attention to the trend and will maintain a self-respecting attitude until we find out the truth. (30th Electric Communication Agency)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Colonial Affairs believes that the South Manchuria Railway Reform Plan proposed by the Kwantung Army Special Service Department is not only difficult to implement in fact, but also the developmental potential of various industrial facilities that can be used by the existing South Manchuria Railway's subsidiary companies to develop Manchuria is feared to lead to worrying results. Therefore, it maintains an extremely self-respecting attitude. On the one hand, it expresses support for the Special Service Department's proposal to adjust the supervisory system of administrative organs and seek to rationalize the current administrative structure to eliminate current inconveniences. However, the prerequisite issue is to consider the following items: The South Manchuria Railway is only a railway company, and various subsidiary companies are independent. However, whether the supervisory power over these can be unified by the current three-in-one organization in Manchuria. Whether the current three-in-one system can be distinguished between administrative organs under the military officer system and administrative organs under the civil servant system. Regarding the possibility of unifying the supervisory system of the two administrative organs, the Ministry of Colonial Affairs believes that the completion of Manchuria's political and economic work can only be achieved after the above fundamental policy is decided. (30th Electric Communication Agency)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Kwantung Army's reform plan for the South Manchuria Railway and its contents have caused great shock to all parties. Moreover, the president of the South Manchuria Railway, Hayashi, seems to have already agreed to the Kwantung Army's reform plan, which has suddenly shown a tendency to become a major political issue. The reason is that if the reform plan can be realized, a large number of South Manchuria Railway employees will be eliminated, and the military has prepared a retirement payment of 600,000 yen. Therefore, the opposition of the South Manchuria Railway employees is based on this reason. The military's purpose is to bring the supervisory power of the South Manchuria Railway back to the military. However, it is questionable whether the military, which has always been unfamiliar with economic matters, can obtain the benefits it has always had. This has also caused unrest among the South Manchuria Railway's executives. In addition, the new shares that have recently begun to be raised are also in a worrying state. Therefore, the relevant government offices below the Ministry of Colonial Affairs, as well as various political parties, are naturally strongly opposed to the military's plan. Moreover, since President Hayashi has already agreed, this issue has changed from an issue between the South Manchuria Railway and the Kwantung Army to a major issue for the government.

<h3>Deadlock in India-Japan Conference</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated today that differences of opinion between the two sides in the India-Japan Commercial Conference in New Delhi are still very large, and the next few days will be the most critical period. (30th Reuters)</p>
<p>Bombay After Lancashire cotton industry representatives agreed on a compromise with Indian cotton industry representatives, they have set off back to England. The head of the delegation, Claire Harris, said on the verge of leaving that he was deeply pleased with the results of the consultation with Indian and Japanese industrialists. The statement of agreement reached by the British and Indian cotton industry delegations stated that on the Indian side, its cotton industry needs more protection than the United Kingdom to prevent foreign competition, and stated that when the excess burden imposed by India on imported goods in October 1931 is abolished, no new recommendations will be made for the import tax on British cotton cloth. British cotton yarn imported into India can be taxed at 5% ad valorem, and a special tax of 1 anna and a quarter per pound can be levied. British rayon fabrics will be taxed at 30% ad valorem, and rayon fabrics with 10% or more rayon will be taxed at 2.5 annas per square yard. Fabrics made of a combination of cotton and rayon will be taxed at 2 annas per square yard. The agreement expires on December 31, 1935. The Indian delegation also firmly stated that the United Kingdom should make further efforts to purchase more Indian raw cotton. (29th Reuters)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Opium Committee Does Not Recognize the Puppet State; Official Documents Sent Directly to Our Government</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Based on the recommendation of the Eighteen-Member Committee, the League of Nations Opium Board decided today not to send the usual forms estimating opium needed for medicinal and scientific purposes to the government of "Manchukuo," but to send forms concerning China, including Manchuria, to the Chinese government. The Opium Advisory Committee is scheduled to meet today to consider in detail the issue of illegal trade in narcotics, paying particular attention to the status of China as a base for this illegal trade, and will consider the "Manchukuo" issue based on the recommendation of the Eighteen-Member Committee not to recognize "Manchukuo" in fact and in law. The Eighteen-Member Committee advocated that "Manchukuo" must state the purpose of requesting drug exports, which must not conflict with the Opium Convention, but that the permits should not be sent to "Manchukuo," as this would be seen as de facto recognition.

<h3>Japanese Vagrants in the Puppet State; Japanese Side Prepares to Expel Them by Name</h3>
<p>(Changchun) The Japanese consulate, police, and military police authorities here are preparing to compile a list of names of Japanese vagrants in Manchuria in order to expel them from the country by name. The authorities are currently holding joint meetings to take other steps to resolve this issue. The Japanese authorities claim that among the Japanese who have moved to Manchuria since the Eastern Province Incident, the actions of some people have left a stain on the Japanese nation, so they are displeased by the Japanese people and hinder the development of "Manchukuo." It is said that the following types of people can be considered vagrants: (1) Those who organize secret societies and engage in political conspiracies to incite disputes; (2) Those who use the names of Japanese and Manchurian officials to seize illegitimate privileges and benefits; (3) Those who extort money through fraudulent behavior; (4) Those whose behavior taints the reputation of the Japanese nation; (5) Actions hindering the development of "Manchukuo" (30th Reuters)</p>
<h3>Palestine Unrest</h3>

<h3>Central National Government Two Weekly Memorial Reports – Wang Zhengting…General Mobilization of Industry – Wang Jingwei…Diplomacy and Finance</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) – The Central Government held its 102nd weekly memorial meeting at 9:00 AM on the 30th, attended by Wang Zhengting, Yang Shuzhuang, Zhang Zhen, Li Ciwen, Xie Zuomin, and hundreds of staff members. Wang Zhengting presided and reported on "General Mobilization of National Industry," stating that to resolve the national crisis and seek the greatest happiness for the people, it is essential to develop industry. The industrial plan advocated by the Premier must be realized in order to achieve the most important part of the Three Principles of the People – the Principle of People's Livelihood. There are many difficulties in current industrial development. We must know where the obstacles lie and act together to remove them. The current obstacles can be divided into two aspects: (1) Social aspects include a lack of substantial capital, lack of investment interest, and lack of technical talent. (2) Government aspects include instability, transportation obstacles, and heavy taxes. The above are all based on personal experience and are indeed the reasons for industrial stagnation. Comrades of our party have the responsibility to promote the doctrine, lead the people, and revive the nation. Therefore, we should be of one mind and one heart to make the people of the whole country carry out a general mobilization of industry, with the government providing assistance, maintenance, and protection, and advance towards the future of industry.

<p>(Nanjing) – The National Government held its weekly memorial meeting at 10:00 AM on the 30th, attended by Chen Shuren, Chu Minyi, Lin Xiang, Chen Shaokuan, Li Yuanding, Wei Huai, Chen Qicai, and over 600 officials of the National Government's Executive Yuan. President Wang presided, led the salutations, and reported on the recent situation of diplomacy and finance. First, he described the diplomatic situation: (1) Germany's withdrawal from the League of Nations. China, as a member of the League of Nations, is deeply saddened by this news. However, Germany's withdrawal from the League of Nations should not be seen as a sign that European peace will be broken. The authorities of various countries are working to find appropriate remedies. European peace and world peace are also closely related. (2) The resumption of diplomatic relations between the United States and Russia is about to be achieved, which is also a gratifying event for the future of international peace and Far Eastern peace. (3) What China needs now is construction, and there is no better environment for construction than peace. Therefore, China's desire for peace is even more urgent than other countries. However, peace means peace only after there is equality. There can be no peace without equality. The so-called equality is not only equality in international status, but also equality in national strength. There can hardly be equality in international status without equality in national strength. Therefore, China's method of ensuring peace is to strengthen national strength. Without reliance, there will be no wishful thinking. Only by being able to be an enemy can one be a friend. Premier Sun Yat-sen said in his inaugural declaration as President in Nanjing on New Year's Day of the first year of the Republic of China: "Fulfill the duties of civilized countries in order to enjoy the rights of civilized countries." This is China's golden rule. China's diligence in seeking political and economic construction is to fulfill the obligations of a civilized country, and the method of diligently seeking to reorganize the army and strengthen national defense is also to fulfill the obligations of a civilized country. China is very concerned about the deterioration of the international situation or the gradual improvement of the international situation. However, China knows that all diplomatic means are not what China needs in its current state. Today, China only has the means to survive by being a faithful construction project and becoming a modern and healthy country. Next, he described the financial situation. Yesterday, the Central Party Department approved the resignation of Comrade Song Ziwen from the position of Minister of Finance, and Comrade Kong Xiangxi was appointed as his successor. Since January 28th, Comrade Song has been appointed in times of crisis, doing his best and working without rest. China's finances have been able to be maintained until today, and his achievements have been deeply admired by the comrades. Although he is determined to leave due to mental and physical exhaustion, he is fortunate to continue to serve as a standing committee member of the National Economic Commission. Although he has slightly relieved himself of his financial burdens, he has the opportunity to concentrate on economic construction. Comrade Kong has both knowledge and experience in finance and will be able to do the job well. The most urgent things for China to do today are to suppress bandits and carry out construction. All financial and economic measures are focused on this, which is the fixed policy of the Central Government. The financial and economic authorities only have the strength to implement it.

<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Forms Shipbuilding Committee – Formulates Shipbuilding Plan – Loan Terms for Purchasing Ships Signed</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) – An official from the Navigation Administration Department of the Ministry of Communications said that in addition to the ships previously sold and leased by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, which should be used to meet urgent needs, the company will borrow £400,000 from the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Committee to purchase new ships. The loan terms have been signed, and the company immediately organized a shipbuilding committee to formulate a shipbuilding plan, which has been submitted to the ministry for review. The plan includes building four ocean-going ships, each with a load capacity of 3,000 tons. The ship equipment will be of the latest world-class type, with a speed of 42 li per hour. The cost of each ship has been approved at 1.05 million yuan. The routes will be regular routes to Shanghai, Shantou, Xiamen, Guangzhou, and Hong Kong, which is expected to reduce the sea voyage by 70 to 80 hours compared to the current Hai Xiang, Hai Rui, Yuan An, and other ships. In addition, two Yangtze River ships will each have 30 tons and will be of the Taikoo-style Wusong type. However, since river ships cannot cross the ocean to China, the meeting decided to purchase the steel boiler and other large components from the United Kingdom and transport them to Shanghai, where the Jiangnan Shipyard will undertake the construction. The interior decoration will cost 1.2 million yuan, and the construction and assembly costs in Shanghai will also cost 700,000 yuan. Including the four ocean-going ships at 4.16 million yuan, the total cost will be 6.06 million yuan. Therefore, £400,000 may still not be enough, and the company plans to raise 130,000 yuan to complete the project. (30th Special Telegram)</p>

<h3>Liu-Tang Conflict Handled by Song with Full Authority – First Step is to Stop the Fighting – Second Step is to Investigate</h3>
<p>(Beiping) – A spokesman for the Military Branch Council stated that the conflict between Liu Guitang and Tang is purely a private action with no political significance and is therefore irrelevant to the overall situation. Song has been ordered to handle the matter with full authority, and it is not expected to escalate. Liu is a reorganized unit, and the reorganization of Tang's unit has not yet begun. (30th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) – The battle between Liu Guitang and Tang Yulin has lasted for four days. Tang's troops are unable to withstand it and are retreating towards Dage Town, Fengning. After receiving news of the battle between Liu and Tang, He Yingqin immediately ordered Song to be responsible for handling it. The first step is to stop the fighting, and the second step is to investigate. Song was ordered to come to Beiping in a day or two to attend the routine meeting of the Military Branch Council, ask He for instructions on everything, and then return to Chahar to handle the matter. It is rumored that the reason for the conflict between Liu and Tang is that when the remnants of Fang Ji occupied northern Ping, Tang did want to join, but Liu prevented him from doing so. After Fang Ji's failure, Tang wanted to occupy Liu's territory, and Liu also wanted to disarm Tang's troops. The conflict broke out on the night of the 26th. The mutiny of Tang's troops is not a fact. Liu's representative, Chu Yingqiao, met with He this morning, reported everything, and presented Liu's telegram to He reporting on the battle. He spoke for half an hour and then left. Chu said that Tang's troops fled to Dage Town in Fengning, and many of their weapons were seized. Four or five artillery pieces were also captured. He promised that he would find a way to pay his army's salaries after this issue was resolved. (30th Special Telegram)</p>

<h3>Jiang Guangnai Returns to Guangdong Directly to His Ancestral Home in Dongguan to Attend to Family Affairs Sends Zhao Yijian to the Province to Report on the Political Situation</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence The various bandit suppression armies in Fujian Province have recently advanced towards western Fujian in separate directions. Chen Mingshu, who has been residing in Hong Kong for a long time, suddenly went to Fuzhou a few days ago and discussed the bandit suppression military affairs and the major plans for dealing with the current situation with Jiang Guangnai, Chairman of the Fujian Provincial Government, several times. After Chen returned to Hong Kong, Jiang Guangnai also returned to Guangdong. Jiang arrived in Hong Kong on the 21st of this month from Xiamen on the Taikoo Steamship Jinan. Chen Mingshu, Li Jishen, and others residing in Hong Kong hosted a banquet to welcome Jiang. They had a very pleasant conversation. On the morning of the 23rd, Jiang took the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway back to his hometown in Dongguan to handle family affairs and to complete the wedding of his eldest son. Accompanying him were Zhang Jingtao, Jiang Yanbo, Su Mingyi, Chen Jiaochu, and Madam Liu Muyu. Jiang plans to stay in his hometown for a few days and then come to Guangzhou to visit the authorities. However, for the convenience of contacting official business, he first sent Zhao Yijian, Chief of Staff of the 19th Route Army Headquarters, to arrive in the province from Hong Kong by steamship on the 23rd to pay respects to the Guangdong military and political authorities and the Southwest Party and government committees, and to report on the recent bandit suppression process and the current situation in Fujian Province. Regarding important matters, they will wait for Jiang to come to the province to discuss them with the Guangdong military and political authorities. Zhao will temporarily stay in the province and will return to Fujian with him after Jiang comes to the province to discuss important matters. (October 23)</p>
<h3>The Austrian Coup and the Future of Europe (Part Two) European Correspondence</h3>
<p>— Lieshan</p>
<p>For what is also considered a matter of life and death for Germany, although it is such a serious blow, it does not dishearten Hitler. The activities of the National Socialist Party in Austria are still being carried out in secret. The latent power is still not to be underestimated. Hitler has the following kinds of people in Austria:</p>
<p>(1) University students. Because of the issue of finding a way out, they are inclined to Hitler, hoping to find a solution to their lives.</p>
<p>(2) The general middle class. Those who have always held the idea of ​​Greater Germany, recalling the prosperity of the past, and helplessly place this hope on Hitler, hoping that he will bring them happiness.</p>
<p>(3) The poor masses of farmers and workers. Because of the pressure of life, they are dissatisfied with the status quo and hope for a future to improve their lives. Hitler's inflammatory propaganda temporarily makes them believe and satisfy them.</p>
<p>(4) People who usually have no political meaning. Simply because they feel that Austria's economic situation cannot survive independently, some people are also susceptible to Hitler's influence.</p>
<p>Combining the above types of people, rather than saying that Hitler's power in Austria is caused by politics, it is better to say that he is forced by the economy. France, Italy, and other countries naturally see this point, and they are working in this area to fundamentally eliminate Hitler's power in Austria. However, the world economic panic has reached such a deep level that everyone is overwhelmed and has no extra energy to help Austria. This is one. Secondly, even if there is extra energy, the root of Austria's economic problems is already deep, and it cannot be restored immediately in a day or two. Moreover, Austria's situation is already very critical. A slight delay will lead to changes. The foundation of the Dufosse coalition government is extremely unstable. Not only can it not obtain a majority vote in the parliament, but the irreconcilable opposition between Yungler and Stadhamberg within the government party will also erupt sooner or later. At that time, the third party may take the opportunity to benefit from it. In particular, the power of former Defense Minister Fugian is insufficient to cope with the overall situation. On the one hand, forced by the domestic and international political environment, the establishment of a dictatorial regime is only a matter of time. In addition, Yungler and Dufosse are increasingly deviating in their views. All this makes Dufosse have to establish a dictatorial government ahead of schedule, especially before the 14th annual meeting of the League of Nations on September 24, so as to prevent Yungler from launching first after he leaves Austria. So on September 11, in a speech broadcast by wireless telephone, he clearly announced his proposition for the first time, which was to cope with enormous changes and to explain that Austria must have a dictatorial government. He made it very clear that the parliamentary system and liberalism have no value in existence today. The idea of ​​free capitalism and the social and economic system of capitalism are all outdated. He said, we want to create a German-Austrian nation of Christian socialism. He explained that this country must adopt a "guardianship system" (note recorded later) and be implemented by a strong government. Although his speech surprised everyone, it was expected. On the 20th, he dissolved the coalition government and reorganized a completely personal dictatorial government. Former Deputy Prime Minister Yungler resigned and left.</p>
<p>The list of new cabinet members of the Dufosse dictatorial government is as follows:</p>
<p>Prime Minister: Dr. Dufosse (concurrently Minister of Foreign Affairs, Defense, Security, Agriculture and Forestry)</p>
<p>Deputy Prime Minister: Fei Shaozuo</p>
<p>Minister of Education and Justice: Dr. Zhou Quniek</p>
<p>Minister of Finance: Dr. Bulique</p>
<p>Minister of Commerce and Communications: Stokenger</p>
<p>Minister without Portfolio: Dr. Inder (amendment of the constitution and administration)</p>
<p>Dr. Keiber (managing internal affairs)</p>
<p>Looking at this list, the impression we get is undoubtedly that Dufosse is imitating Mussolini. He holds the two powers of the military police (Defense and Security) in his own hands, because without this, he cannot be a dictator. Before going to Geneva to attend the League of Nations meeting, he gave another speech. In addition to the policy guidelines, he particularly focused on introducing the new Deputy Prime Minister Fei Shaozuo, saying how strong his ability to be a person and how resolute he was, tracing his experience during the European War and his background in the military, etc. This is equivalent to telling his enemy party, you have to be careful if you make trouble.</p>
<p>On the 23rd, Fei Shaozuo, in the name of Deputy Prime Minister, re-promulgated the martial law decree of July 24, 1917. All power was concretely and completely concentrated in the hands of the military and police. Although some disturbances occurred after that, they were not enough to cause trouble for the time being. As for Dufosse himself, he was sitting at the Geneva League of Nations seat, engaging in a diplomatic tongue war with the German representative Propaganda Minister Goebbels.</p>
<p>After this change, the situation in Europe gradually became more complicated and the cracks became deeper. The future of Austria and even the future of Europe depends on how the facts develop in the future.</p>
<p>At present, Italy seems to be gaining some advantage.</p>
<p>Note: "Guardianship system" is a tentative translation of the German word "Standisch." It was originally a system of the Middle Ages. Recently, it has been promoted by Mussolini, Hitler, and others and has become a proposition of the Fascist Party. To put it simply, it is a social system in which scholars, farmers, workers, and businessmen each abide by their duties and do not make trouble. It is extremely opposed to liberalism. The two words "guardianship" are quite inappropriate, but for a while, I can't think of other appropriate translations, so I will write them down for the guidance of the wise.

<h3>Japanese Military Attache Arrives in Gansu by Plane A Group of Four Japanese in Total Carrying Maps of Military Land in the Northwest National Government Sends Personnel to Accompany and Take Care of Them</h3>
<p>Lanzhou Correspondence Euro-Asia Aviation Aircraft No. 6 arrived in Lanzhou on September 28 and landed at the Euro-Asia Aviation Station in Gongxingdun, ten miles outside Dongguan, at 5:00 PM. The Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau immediately sent Inspector Xue Yunsheng with two policemen to the scene to inspect and take care of them. Then they saw several passengers getting off the plane, most of whom were not Chinese. Xue then stepped forward to ask their names. Each passenger took out a business card from his body, which read "Suzuki Mitsuru, Army Major General, Military Attache of the Army Attached to the Embassy of the Republic of China in the Empire of Japan, Shigeki Sakata, Japanese Army Military Attache, Masanobu Tsuji, Japanese Army Military Attache, Shintaro Kaneda, Minister of Military Administration of the Empire of Japan." They were all Japanese. There were also "Wang Changchun, Lieutenant General Councilor of the National Government, and his adjutant, Tao Xiaojie." Xue then asked the Japanese if they had passports. Kaneda replied that they did not. Wang Changchun said that he was ordered by the government to accompany the Japanese military attaches to travel to the three provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, and Xinjiang. They departed from Shanghai and chartered an Euro-Asia Aviation aircraft for a price of 16,000 yuan. Because the flight did not pass through customs checkpoints, they did not have passports. Xue felt that during this time of national crisis, Gansu and Xinjiang were troubled areas in the Northwest. Why did the Japanese come here? So he stated that since they had no passports, he needed to inspect their luggage. The Japanese refused and said that no one had inspected their luggage in Shanghai and Nanjing. Wang Changchun even said, "You should save some face and don't look at the luggage." Xue, being in his position, did not dare not to carry out the inspection. While he was inspecting, Nan Jingxing, a section member of the Gansu Provincial Government, suddenly came, interacted with the Japanese, turned around and glared at Xue, saying, "Foreigners are guests, don't be like this." At this time, Xue had already found a detailed map of the Northwest three provinces for military use, a paper on the route of the aviation route from Shanghai to Xinjiang, and a camera with two rolls of film of the landscape of Shaanxi and Gansu taken from the Japanese. Xue held this and said to Nan, "Please see that the Japanese military attaches are taking pictures of the landscape of our Northwest. What is their intention? Xinjiang is in a state of chaos. What is the purpose of the Japanese going there?" He didn't need to be polite. "Let's go to the provincial government to report together to fulfill our duties." Then they went to the city together. Xue first reported to the Director of the Public Security Bureau, and then reported to the Provincial Government. Chairman Zhu heard the news and immediately ordered the Secretariat to develop the films first, and then telegraphed Nanjing for instructions. Now the Japanese and Wang Changchun are all staying at the Da Hotel on Dongjie in the city. Wang also told people that he was ordered to accompany the Japanese military attaches to travel to the Northwest by plane, and that the landscape was also taken from the plane with a camera, and that he could not stop it at any time. At this time, when the chaos in Xinjiang has not been settled and the border defense is extremely urgent, the four Japanese military attaches flew to them, which does not seem to be exclusively for the purpose of travel.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Consul in Guangzhou Arbitrarily Arrests Koreans Korean Park Ui-il is Currently Detained at the French Municipal Council The Japanese Consul Accuses Park of Advocating Anti-Japanese Revolution The Municipal Government Negotiates with the Japanese Consul for Unconditional Release</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence After the Japanese Consulate in Guangzhou arrested the Korean Park Ui-il in Dongshan, Guangzhou a few days ago, it immediately deposited the Korean at the French Municipal Council in Shameen. The French Inspector General treated the detainees quite favorably, opening a special room for them to live in and issuing eight corners of food per day. The French Consul also upheld justice in this case, purely as a third party, and advised Chinese and Japanese officials to resolve the matter peacefully to avoid escalating diplomatic incidents. As for the Guangzhou Municipal Government, since Park Ui-il was arbitrarily arrested by the Japanese, it has already prepared a protest letter to the Japanese Consul to argue that it has encroached on our country's sovereignty. Kawagoe, the Japanese Consul stationed in Guangdong, formally replied to the Guangzhou Municipal Government in writing yesterday. The contents of the reply stated that Park Ui-il is a Korean who has become a Chinese citizen. This Consul has learned that Park Ui-il has been advocating revolution and opposing the policies implemented by the Japanese Empire in Korea on Chinese territory, and the Chinese government's local officials have not stopped him, but have given him opportunities to act. If this continues, Sino-Japanese diplomacy will deteriorate. Therefore, this Consul cannot but impose sanctions and send personnel to guide him for investigation. Now that your government has requested the release of Park Ui-il, this Consul can be accommodating and do so. However, if Park Ui-il is released, can your government assume the important responsibility of sanctioning him from advocating anti-Japanese revolution on Chinese territory? This is to inform you, etc. After the Municipal Authorities received the letter, they believed that the Japanese Consul's reply had the suspicion of interfering in our country's political stance, and decided to rebut it reasonably based on the international treatment of political prisoners, with the aim of unconditionally releasing the arrested Korean Park Ui-il. Recently, it was also reported that Gan Jiehou, a diplomat for the five provinces, said that the Park Ui-il case is now being negotiated by the Guangzhou Municipal Government and is progressing smoothly. The scope of the negotiation will not be expanded. If a solution cannot be reached locally, the diplomat of the five provinces will report the entire case to our country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and directly negotiate with the Japanese government.

<h3>Wuhu's Rice Situation The Rice Market is Already Active The Construction Department Plans to Formulate Relief Methods</h3>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence Anhui is a rice-producing area. The annual output, in addition to supplying local people's food, actually has a surplus of six million to ten million piculs. Most of it is exported from Wuhu to exchange for cash, which is used to supply rural farmers and pay taxes, and to regulate domestic people's food. Therefore, most of Wuhu's commerce and the economy of the entire Anhui province are transferred by Wuhu's rice market. Among them, those engaged in rice business are roughly divided into the following organizations: (1) Rice and Grain Procurement and Transportation Industry Association. This type of merchant specializes in purchasing rice and grain in Wuhu and transporting it to other places. For example, the four gangs of Guangchao, Yanning, etc., all collect and transport to Guangdong, Chaozhou, Yantai, Ningbo, Shandong, Zhejiang, Pingjin and other places. There are currently 27 rice shops set up by various gangs. (2) Rice Shop Industry Association, which purchases rice from villages and towns and resells it to procurement and transportation operators. According to statistics, there are 50 such rice shops. (3) Machine Rice Milling Industry Association, which mills rough rice from the countryside into Wuhu into mature rice, or sets up warehouses dedicated to renting to rice shops and rice shops, there are currently nine. (4) Rice Hulling Workshop Industry Association, which is an old-fashioned rice hulling workshop that specializes in hulling rice for others and collecting rent. There are still 49 in existence. (5) Grain and Rice Shop Association, which sells rice and grain daily to supply the daily food needs of the people in this city, so it is also called the small market.</p>
<p>The amount of Wuhu rice exported has varied over the years. It is also due to the uneven demand in foreign ports, and the annual bumper harvest and failure in various counties in this province. Since 1922, Wuhu rice exports have been the most abundant in 1925, with a volume of 6.17 million piculs, an average price of 4.4 taels of customs taels, and a total value of more than 27 million taels. Since then, it has been squeezed by foreign rice, and the situation has deteriorated. As for this year, from January to the end of July, exports have reached 1.68 million piculs, with a total value of 10.38 million silver dollars. After August, the new grain was listed, and it was another year of bumper harvest. The autumn harvest in Guangchao and other places was reduced this year, and the Chinese people unanimously demanded an increase in the tax on foreign rice dumping. Therefore, all parties competed to purchase from Wuhu. Recently, there are always 30,000 to 40,000 piculs exported every day. The activity of the rice market can be seen in general. If the government implements an increase in the tax on foreign rice, the future is even more promising. However, although Wuhu rice is selling well, it is actually not profitable for farmers. Although the current rice price has risen slightly, it is still far from the previous high price. In mid-September, the value of Wuhu rice was 4.5 taels of customs taels per picul (equivalent to 6 yuan and 63 cents), while farmers only earned more than 5 yuan.</p>
<p>The destination of Wuhu's large surplus of rice and grain is as described above. The northern ports include Yantai, Tianjin, Dalian, and Qingdao, the eastern ports include Shanghai and Ningbo, and the southeastern ports include Guangzhou and Shantou. There are dozens of years of history, but since foreign rice is imported and dumped from Annam, India, and Siam, with a total of more than 22.4 million piculs per year, the impact on Wuhu's rice sales is self-evident. If domestic rice merchants are limited by capital, they cannot transport and sell in large quantities and quickly. There are also unscrupulous merchants who add water, which makes it impossible to stay for a long time. These are the biggest crises facing domestic rice. Progress cannot be discussed, and gradual decline is also expected.</p>
<p>Therefore, rescuing Wuhu's rice market is now an urgent task. The Anhui Construction Department previously sent a special commissioner, Chen Bikang, to Wuhu to investigate. As a result, the following methods were formulated for saving the Wuhu rice market and will be submitted to the government for adoption, which are specifically recorded below: (1) Please the government immediately increase the import tax on foreign rice, and the tax rate must be 30% of the current market price. (2) The organization of the rice industry should be collectivized. The government should re-register and encourage the organization of capital concentration. (3) Establish a rice and grain inspection agency to specialize in inspecting rice quality. (4) Reduce all consumption in the rice market to reduce rice and grain costs. (5) Promote rural transportation and sales cooperatives. (6) State-owned shipping companies should prepare a large number of transport ships to transport domestic rice at extremely low prices to facilitate the circulation of rice and grain. (27th)</p>
<h3>Revival of the Postal Surge in Hankou The Post Office Dismisses Members of the Labor Union The National Postal Union Cables Hankou to Condemn</h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence The postal workers in Hankou previously caused a surge because the Hubei Postal Administration did not recognize the labor union organization. After the Ministry of Communications sent personnel to jointly discuss and resolve the matter with the National Postal Workers' Union and the Administration, the surge came to an end. However, not long after, the Administration published a statement denying recognition of the labor union. A few days ago, it demoted the postman Li Liqiang on the pretext of causing a second surge. Li is currently a member of the labor union. Once he is demoted, he cannot but suspect that the Administration deliberately obstructed union affairs. The demotion surge has not yet been resolved, and the Administration has dismissed Li, making the situation even more serious. The National Postal Workers' Union yesterday sent a telegram to the postal director of the Administration, Mr. Smith, and the deputy postal director, Liu Yaoting, to strongly condemn them. The original telegram stated, "After investigating your Administration, the punishment of Postman Li Liqiang was imposed under the pretext of the Postal Office's band. Later, he was given a dismissal for disobeying the transfer order. Our Union is based on the following reasons: (1) The band is organized by colleagues in the Administration and is not public property of the Postal Service. Therefore, the management rules are outside the Postal Outline. This time, Li Liqiang borrowed the team as a colleague and has been serving the team for many years. It is a right to be enjoyed. Even if it does not conform to the rules, there is no responsibility in postal administration. Your Administration dismissed and demoted him based on the Outline. It is extremely illegal. (2) The members of the Executive and Supervisory Committees of the Postal Workers' Union cannot be transferred during their term of office. This was one of the conditions agreed upon with your subordinate in front of Mr. Yu Senwen, the special commissioner of the Ministry of Communications, when the Hankou Postal Surge was resolved last month. Li Liqiang is a current member of the Executive Committee of the Hankou Postal Workers' Union. Your Administration's transfer of him violates the agreement and is suspected of secretly obstructing union affairs. (3) Li Liqiang was given an illegal punishment. Your Administration did not follow the rules and did not allow Li Liqiang to state his reasons, nor did it allow him to take leave. Even the Union repeatedly pleaded for leave, but they were ignored. When Li Liqiang was sent to Shanghai to appeal at the resolution of the Union, your Administration proceeded to dismiss him. Such suppression and procedures were not in compliance, making it difficult for people to accept. Based on the above three points, the facts are very clear. Our Union cannot but consider your Administration's actions to be an illegal deprivation of the interests of employees and an act to obstruct the activities of the Union, and an unfortunate yeast in the process of saving the Postal Service through cooperation between superiors and subordinates. Our Union deeply regrets this. We hereby deny all the above-mentioned illegal punishments of your Administration and reserve the right to restore the legitimate rights of our workers that have been deprived. If any disputes arise as a result, your Administration shall bear full responsibility." (October 28)</p>
<h3>Lu-Huang Disaster Relief Committee's Embankment and Dike Reinforcement Work: Xiao Pang Village Embankment Height Increased by 1.5 Meters; Stone Village Opening Project Also Surveyed and Estimated; Work Commenced on Reinforcing All Major Embankments</h3>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: The Yellow River Flood Relief Committee, recognizing the approaching cold weather, is actively working to close and reinforce the openings along the Yellow River in Hebei, Shandong, and Henan provinces. They dispatched Shandong engineer Huang Daorong to collaborate with the provincial river affairs bureau to close the breach at Xiao Pang Village on the south bank. Work has already begun, but the chief engineer intends to raise the embankment by another 1.5 meters. The breach at Stone Village on the north bank is the responsibility of Hebei Province to close and reinforce. Surveys and estimates have been completed, but the large sum of money required raises questions about how to proceed. The Shandong River Affairs Bureau has already reported the state of Anlan (tranquility) to the provincial government, requesting awards for those who have contributed. They are also repairing dikes along the river and raising the Yan Family Embankment downstream to prevent ice jams, taking precautions for unforeseen circumstances. The situation in various areas is detailed below:</p>
<h3>Work on Closing the Xiao Pang Village Breach Has Commenced</h3>
<p>Relief Committee engineer Huang Daorong and River Affairs Bureau engineering section chief Pan Fen arrived at Xiao Pang Village and surveyed the opening. The dike required is estimated to be 3,087 meters long, requiring 72,175 cubic meters of earth. They divided the project into seven sections and invited bids from contractors. The lowest bid was 44,277 yuan. Work commenced immediately, as it is only dry-land work, making construction easy. It is estimated to take 50 days. If the weather remains stable, the project should be completed before December 20th. After the bidding, Huang Daorong took the plans to Kaifeng to meet with Relief Committee chief engineer Song Xishang, reporting on the progress. Song suggested that the dike was too low and would not withstand major flooding, advocating raising it by another 1.5 meters. However, this increase overturned the budget, requiring a new survey and estimate. Additional funding will be requested from the Relief Committee for the closure project.</p>
<h3>Survey and Estimate for Closing the Stone Village Breach Completed</h3>
<p>The current at the Stone Village breach on the north bank remains strong, causing actual damage to the counties of Pu, Fan, Shou, and Yang in western Shandong. The Hebei Provincial River Affairs Bureau is responsible for this project. A recent survey and estimate placed the cost at over 1.6 million yuan. The Relief Committee's regulations stipulate that only 1.5 million yuan is available for closing breaches in the three provinces of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan. The minimum cost for Shandong to close the Xiao Pang Village breach is 50,000 yuan, and closing the breach at Lanfeng in Henan is also estimated to require approximately 100,000 yuan. This leaves only 1.35 million yuan. Now, the Stone Village project requires 1.6 million yuan, exceeding the budget by a significant 250,000 yuan. It is reported that this project is very important to Hebei Province, and they plan to request assistance from Hebei to complete this major project.</p>
<h3>Embankments Being Repaired to Prevent Ice Jams</h3>
<p>The Shandong River Affairs Bureau recognizes that this year's Yellow River water level is very high. Fortunately, thanks to the round-the-clock defense by river affairs personnel and local officials and residents along the river, no breaches occurred. However, many embankments have been damaged and urgently need repair. Stone materials are currently being transported and distributed to various sections for repair. The Yan Family Embankment in Lijin County, at the very downstream end, is particularly important as it is too low. In the past, the low embankment near Ji Zi Liu resulted in ice blocks being thrown onto the bank during ice jams, leading to a breach. This year, the Yellow River's base flow is too large, and there is fear that Yan Family may repeat the mistakes of Ji Zi Liu in the event of ice jams. Therefore, workers are currently being supervised to raise and reinforce the embankment to ensure safety. Furthermore, the River Affairs Bureau has reported the state of Anlan to the provincial government. The county magistrates, district chiefs, village leaders, and civilian defense team leaders of all counties along the river this year, as well as the Jinan garrison pistol brigade under Wu Huawen and the Yanggu garrison under Fu Guozeng, all provided exceptional effort in defending the river. The provincial government is requested to review and grant appropriate awards. (28th)</p>
<h3>Songjiang: Zhang Chongding Accused of Embezzlement and Detained</h3>
<p>Lang Qinnong, a merchant from Shihudang, mainly deals in oil, sesame, and bean cake, with most transactions on credit. He found it difficult to collect debts, so Shen Yuzhen introduced him to lawyer Zhang Chongding to handle the collection. Shen Yuzhen was a clerk in Zhang's Songjiang office. Aside from drafting documents and appearing in court, Shen Yuzhen handled all the work. However, after Lang entrusted the case, he learned that Shen Yuzhen had collected over 3,000 yuan of debts, but when Lang inquired, Shen always said that the money had been handed over to the lawyer and the case was not yet settled, stalling for time. Eventually, Shen Yuzhen knew he had embezzled a large sum of money and could not stay, so he fled without a trace. Lang then accused lawyer Zhang Chongding of embezzlement and breach of trust, reporting the matter to the prosecutor's office. Shen Yuzhen was summoned repeatedly but could not be found and a warrant has been issued. At 2 PM today, another court session was held. Lawyer Zhang Chongding appeared. The prosecutor questioned the plaintiff, Lang Qinnong, who stated his case. Then, lawyer Zhang stated his case, generally blaming the absconding clerk Shen Yuzhen. As a result, the official ordered the defendant, lawyer Zhang Chongding, to be detained pending further investigation.</p>

<h3>Wuxi: Shi Ying from Nanjing Visits Wuxi</h3>
<p>Shi Ying, the mayor of Nanjing, took sick leave last week to recuperate. Admiring the beautiful scenery and excellent landscapes of Wuxi, he traveled to Wuxi by train on the 25th and stayed at the Taihu Hotel. For several days, he visited the Education Institute at Sheqiaotou, the Dongtingzhen Beixia Experimental District, the Lifeng Experimental District, the Public Experimental School, the Farm Busy Daycare, and the Improvement Association. He was accompanied by Gao Jian Si, Yu Qing Tang, Wu Fu Zhen, and Chen Yi. Shi expressed his strong admiration for the public education in Wuxi. Yesterday, accompanied by Wu Fuzhen, he toured the famous scenic spots such as Taihu Lake, Little Ji Mountain, and Li Garden. It is reported that Shi will continue to visit education-related places today and is scheduled to leave Wuxi and return to Nanjing tomorrow (the 1st).</p>
<h3>Discovery of an Illegal Drug Manufacturing Operation</h3>
<p>Recently, several illegal drug manufacturing operations have been discovered in the city. Most are large-scale, selling a large quantity of drugs, with incredibly far-reaching toxic effects. The previous night, Qian Tianxiong, the captain of the county water patrol team, received a tip that Wang Guiqing and others were secretly operating the Guo Fusheng drug manufacturing operation inside the De Tai Yuan Smeltery at number 35 Yangyaowan outside the South Gate. They could manufacture 100,000 drug pills every night, on a very large scale, and the sales were also wide-ranging. He was asked to arrest them. After receiving the tip, Captain Qian immediately led patrol boats number three and eight, arriving at the scene around 11 PM. Patrol chief Meng Jianhua led the team ashore, prohibiting pedestrian traffic. He also summoned local official You Benda, breaking into the secret den. On the spot, they discovered a package of white powder (i.e., fine materials), a tin can of milk sugar powder, two pill-making machines, two iron pans, two iron sieves. In the iron sieves, there were 40,000 to 50,000 drug pills being baked, a can of drug pill paste, five hemp bags of foreign iron boxes, and labels with the "Horse and Man" trademark, and wrapping paper. They captured Zhang Achang, a drug pill worker, on the spot. The main culprit, Wang Guiqing, escaped. The landlord, Wang Liqing, owner of the De Tai Yuan Smeltery, was away on business. His son Shijin, along with Zhang Achang and the seized goods, were taken into custody and transferred to the county court yesterday (the 30th). Prosecutor Ren opened the court for interrogation, ordering them all to be detained, awaiting the arrest of the main culprit for legal action.</p>
<h3>Changzhou Anti-Japanese Association Seizes a Large Quantity of Enemy Goods</h3>
<p>Jin Jiwen, director of the Changwu Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association's inspection team, has been working diligently in recent days to inspect for enemy goods. He has seized multiple shipments of enemy goods. Yesterday (the 29th), he seized five steel buckles of enemy goods from the Minhua Factory and four large pieces of health-protective underwear from the Jitai Clothing Store at the railway station, and five pieces of suspected Huiguang twill fabric from Tianshengfu, which were brought to the association. The steel buckles will be submitted to a meeting for punishment. The health underwear and Huiguang twill fabric will be identified before further action. Furthermore, the Xiechang Porcelain Store on the main street was previously found to be selling enemy goods (glass cups) mixed with other products. The Anti-Japanese Association decided to punish them. Recently, the store suddenly hung up an absurd notice at the entrance. The Anti-Japanese Association learned of this and took the notice, planning to parade the store manager, Cao Quanrong, through the streets or make him stand in a wooden cage as punishment. Cao has fled, and the Anti-Japanese Association is investigating his whereabouts to punish him.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou Farmer Unearths an Ancient Mirror</h3>
<p>Wang Guochao, a farmer from Dongtongqiao, Dazhen Town, District 9 in the county, owns an ox for plowing. The other day, Wang's wife was grazing the ox near a small pond, and the ox suddenly jumped uncontrollably and refused to move forward. She led it back and told Wang, and they went together again. When they reached the same spot, the ox continued to jump as before. Wang suspected something was unusual and used a hoe to dig. Within a few feet, he discovered a bronze mirror, weighing about three pounds. The back was engraved with a toad, and the front emitted a glow. He took it home and asked the elders about it. They said it was a heart-protecting mirror of an ancient general. Wang regarded it as an extraordinary treasure, bringing it to Shanghai to sell for a good price.</p>
<h3>Three More Japanese Tourists Visit Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Recently, Japanese people have frequently visited Yangzhou, causing much suspicion among the public. Fortunately, each time, government officials have accompanied them to supervise and prevent any incidents. Now, three more Japanese students from the East Asia Common Culture Academy, Morimoto Seiji, Matsumi Keizaburo, and Izumi Kisaburo, have arrived in Yangzhou from Shanghai via Zhenjiang. They are staying at the Dalu Hotel on Xin Sheng Street. This morning (the 28th), they toured the famous scenic spots in the northern suburbs of Poxi Lake. They left Yangzhou in the afternoon, reportedly heading to Zhenjiang and then to Nanjing to visit friends at the Ministry of Finance.</p>

<h3>Jiangyin Qingyang Town Uncovers a Narcotics Operation</h3>
<p>In March of this year, in the Qingyang area of the 11th district, a secret red pill narcotic manufacturing operation, called the "One Product Company", was discovered. It was found that 240,000 red pills were intercepted by the defense corps when they were transported to the Gaocheng'an area in Wuxi. After investigation, the location of the drug pills was found to be at Shen Wenhua's house in Qingyang Beilong, and then moved to places such as Zhujiaba Sanli'an in Yangzhuang. Thirty thousand pills were produced daily, with Shen Wenhua as the director and a certain team leader in Wuxi, Chen Changsheng and Chen Jinhe as co-managers. It is unknown how the case was resolved in Wuxi after the bust. It turned out that an internal dispute between shareholders in this narcotics operation led to Shen Wenhua reporting it secretly to the authorities. On the 28th, County Magistrate Ruan ordered the Public Security Bureau to dispatch inspector Xu Zhifa and over thirty policemen to search Huang Gonghe's cocoon business in Xiaoqingyang. They found narcotics manufacturing equipment, raw materials, "Tiger and Money," "Five Color" trademark paper, and more than 800 empty boxes. The main culprit had already fled. The cocoon firm's guard Zhu Gengquan was apprehended. Shen Wenhua and Wu Bingjun, director of the Second Branch of the Public Security Bureau, went to the Wuxi Public Security Bureau to submit a document requesting the arrest of Chen Changsheng and others, who were then escorted to Cheng for interrogation and punishment.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battle Between Gaoyou River Mouth Militia and Bandits</h3>

The other night, the corps was passing through the Hekou area when they saw a large boat coming from the south. They immediately ordered it to stop for inspection. A large number of clothes were found, indicating that they were not good people. They were about to seize the boat when suddenly gunfire erupted from the northeast. The militia also opened fire in retaliation. The battle lasted all night. The militia suffered seven deaths and eight injuries. The bandit boat and the bandits fled to the northeast.</p>
<h3>Jishan Female Student Commits Suicide in Opposition to Marriage</h3>
<p>Yang Guiying, a talented female student from a certain school in Tianning Zhuangzhen, Jishan County, was a beautiful and intelligent girl. She was unusually diligent in school, resulting in excellent grades, always ranking among the top students. When she was an infant, her parents arranged a marriage with a Zhu family in the town. Her fiancé was only fourteen years old, making the age difference between them very large. The Zhu family was an old-fashioned family, often confined by etiquette and teachings. Guiying repeatedly expressed her unwillingness to marry him, but her father was very insistent and refused her request, even scolding her. As a result, she was unhappy and conceived a world-weary thought. Suddenly, a few days ago, she purchased a large amount of raw opium and swallowed it in secret. By the time her family discovered it, she was deeply poisoned and her life was in danger.</p>

<h3>Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway to Open to Quzhou at the Beginning of Next Month</h3>
<p>The Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway Bureau announced that the track laying and other projects on the Jinhua-Quzhou section have been completed, and the railway will officially open to traffic in November. Given the current lack of construction funds for major bridge projects on the Jinyu section, efforts should be made to reduce the expenditure as much as possible to save cash before the opening of the railway. Two measures have been planned and decided upon: (1) The wing wall projects for ten bridges including the Jinhua River, Qingyang River, Hou Da Creek, Caoban Creek, Maban Creek, Lingshan Port, Dongji River, and Shangxia Mountain Creek will be cancelled temporarily. Each contractor will be instructed to use river light stone or old cement to pack and stack soil to retain the earth. After the railway opens, the bureau will gradually transport and transport stone slabs from along the line to do it themselves in order to save cash before the opening of the railway. (2) The railing project originally planned for the Dongji River and Shangshan Creek bridges can be postponed. Each contractor has been instructed to comply.</p>
<h3>Pinghu Busts Smuggling of Japanese Yarn</h3>
<p>On the 28th, Yang Baoming, an inspector of the Anti-Japanese Association, was strolling around Yangjiaqiao in Yinyang Lane when he caught sight of a porter carrying two large bundles of yarn, looking flustered and walking quickly. He hurried to inspect them and found that they were indeed Japanese goods, including ten pieces of colored thread and thirty pieces of 8-count Japanese yarn. It was learned that they were purchased by the Zhiji Sock Factory in Weijiaqiao. The porter was ordered to take the yarn to the Anti-Japanese Association to be sealed up, pending review at the next meeting.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Busts Human Trafficking Ring</h3>
<p>Gong Asan, also known as Gong Linbiao, a resident of 18 Le'anfang in Jiangbei, Ningbo, is currently a detective in the Yinjiangqiao Public Security Branch. He and his mistress, Ms. Xu, are engaged in the business of trafficking in women. Yesterday, the 4th Public Security Bureau learned about this and sent Inspector Dong with police officers to arrest them. The main culprit, Gong Asan, fled upon hearing the news. His mistress, Ms. Xu, and the trafficked women A Zhu, Meng Sun, and Wang Chen, as well as accomplices Chen Zude, Chen Asi, and Chen Wang, a total of seven men and women, were arrested and transferred to the main bureau for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Settlement of the Mingguang Dyeing Industry Strike</h3>
<p>The various aspects of the strike by dyeing workers in this port have been recorded in previous reports. It is now learned that the two sides initially held their ground, refusing to budge. Since a conflict occurred within the workers, and the Public Security Bureau detained the perpetrators, Qu Yubao and others, the situation took a sharp turn. The workers abandoned trivial conditions, and the cloth industry agreed to add one sizing fee. Work was resumed uniformly today (the 29th).</p>
<h3>Dingyuan Security Team Disarmed</h3>
<p>When the bandit gangs such as Zhang Dabizi previously disturbed Dingyuan, the county security team took the opportunity to demand pay and disobeyed orders, causing the local area to be devastated. This time, the special service battalion of the provincial security team, with the approval of the superiors, disarmed the entire team on a previous day and gave them severance pay. Vice-Captain Yin Xiyan was removed from his post and Zhao Xinhua was temporarily appointed by the province. The defense of the city is maintained by the special service battalion. The follow-up issues are being discussed.</p>

<h3>New Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday; Takes Office on the First of Next Month; Internal Changes Unlikely; Kong Discusses Financial Plans; Song Discusses the Resignation Process; Premier Wang Arrives in Shanghai This Morning to Express Sincere Condolences to Song</h3>
<p>Finance Minister Song Ziwen resigned from all concurrent positions. The Central Political Committee Standing Committee approved the resignation the previous day and appointed Kong Xiangxi as Vice President of the Executive Yuan and concurrently Minister of Finance. After receiving the new appointment in Nanjing, Kong and his wife, Ms. Song Ailing, left Nanjing by train that night, arriving in Shanghai yesterday morning to visit Song and discuss finance. Kong told reporters that everything would be handled according to Minister Song's original plan. He is scheduled to take office on the 1st and will not make major changes to the original officials in the Ministry. Song said he was considering the position of Standing Committee member of the Economic Council and was willing to contribute opinions on financial issues at any time as a citizen. The details of each item are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Song and Kong Met Yesterday to Discuss Matters</h3>
<p>Kong was summoned to Nanjing by the Central Government. At 4 PM on the 28th, he and General Chiang Kai-shek boarded a Ford plane to Nanjing to meet General Chiang and Premier Wang. After being appointed Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance by the Central Government, he came to Shanghai with his wife, Ms. Song Ailing, the previous night because there were many financial matters to be discussed and connected with former Minister Song. He arrived in Shanghai at 8 AM yesterday morning. After getting off at the North Station, he went directly to his private residence on West Ingham Road.</p>
<h3>Financial Discussions</h3>
<p>After Kong arrived in Shanghai, Song Ziwen went to visit Kong at 8:40 AM and left at 9:20 AM. According to Song, it was entirely to discuss transfer procedures. Kong then visited Song at the Ministry of Finance's Shanghai office at 10:10 AM for one hour to discuss ways to solve financial difficulties.</p>
<h3>Takes Office on the First</h3>
<p>During Minister Song's tenure, the original financial plan was to strive to conserve expenses, not only government expenses but also military expenses, to meet the budget. However, the current banditry situation in Sichuan and Jiangxi is spreading, and the government army is about to launch an all-out attack, and the funds for suppressing the bandits cannot be delayed. Therefore, the opinions of the Central Government are that, in addition to trying their best to allocate funds for bandit suppression, they should try their best to conserve government expenses if it is unavoidable. Based on this purpose, Kong came to Shanghai to visit former Minister Song to withdraw inquiries on how to solve financial difficulties. Kong will implement the original plan of Song in the future and is scheduled to take office in Nanjing on the first of next month.</p>
<h3>Very Few Changes</h3>
<p>After Song resigned, Deputy Finance Ministers Zou Lin and Li Tiao Sheng, and the various counselors and secretaries, all expressed their intention to advance and retreat with Song, and it was heard that they had submitted their resignations. It is now learned that Kong is advocating for retention and, except for those who firmly request to leave, there will not be many changes. Even the tax collection agencies will not be changed.</p>
<h3>Kong Xiangxi's Remarks</h3>
<p>The newly appointed Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, Kong Xiangxi, briefly discussed his policy as Finance Minister with reporters from various newspapers after visiting Song Ziwen at the Shanghai office of the Ministry of Finance yesterday morning. Everything will follow the rules and regulations of the previous administration, and he will work to increase revenue and reduce expenditure. Due to the urgency of time, he could not talk much. He then received reporters from various newspapers at the Central Bank on the third floor at 5 PM and made the following remarks:</p>
<h3>Cultivating Revenue Sources and Increasing Revenue</h3>
<p>Kong first stated two points on increasing revenue and reducing expenditure in finance. Increasing revenue is nothing more than trying to increase tax revenue. Now the central tax revenue, such as consolidated tax, tobacco and alcohol tax, salt tax, etc., has different levels of prosperity and weakness in various places, which needs to be rectified and developed, or new tax sources need to be opened up. However, it should be determined in accordance with the national economy and social conditions. Our country is not really poor, but what is poor is that not all Chinese people make full use of it for the benefit of the people. Because our country has a vast territory and abundant products, far better than other countries, but the goods are scattered on the ground and have not been developed. This is what the saying goes, "Holding a golden bowl to beg for food". The reason why wealth cannot be developed and tax revenue has not improved is mostly limited by the environment, years of natural disasters and man-made disasters, and the rise of banditry, so that people cannot live and work in peace and poverty. The national income is also reduced accordingly. Only when the people are prosperous can the country be rich. Therefore, the most urgent task at present is to suppress the bandits. After the bandits are suppressed, the people will be able to live and work in peace, and the rural areas will have the hope of revival. When vitality is restored, the source of tax revenue can also be prosperous. After the vitality of the society is restored and the wealth of the people increases, the government can increase tax revenue at this time, and the people will have the ability to bear it. But how to increase revenue is now being studied, and we must seek a source that is beneficial to the country and harmless to the people. I hope that the source will be a sweet spring. Otherwise, regardless of everything, only seeking to increase revenue at present, without considering the people's ability to bear it and the impact they are suffering, the result will be that the people's livelihood will be difficult, and the country will be in a more difficult situation. Therefore, the source is a toxic source or bitter water. Therefore, the state's taxation must be based on the livelihood of the people. For example, in the United States, the people's tax obligations are based on the amount of income and the severity of their burden on the country. However, it is not easy to say this in our country. Because the main source of tax revenue in our country is land tax, officials only know how to tax farmers, and do not ask about the abundance of annual harvest and the barrenness of the land. As a result, the burden is uneven, the farmers are in trouble, and the wealthy people have not shouldered more obligations to the country. Therefore, in the future, finance should pay more attention to cultivating vitality.</p>
<h3>Engaging in Streamlining</h3>
<p>In terms of streamlining, the actual situation must also be carefully examined and cannot be generalized. Any stream that consumes uselessly should be blocked and no sliver be allowed to flow out. For every sliver comes from the sweat and blood of the people. The government must prevent the waste of a single sliver, a hair, an iota. For the proper flow, not only should it not be economized, but it should also be made more smooth. For example, the cost of construction should not be economized. Because the more developed the construction industry is, the stronger the domestic productivity will be, and the more it will help the country's tax revenue. Therefore, the proper flow actually implies the effect of increasing revenue. It is like water management that should block up dikes with breaches to avoid harm to the people. On the contrary, the relevant water conservancy projects should dredge channels for water conservancy to the advantage of the people.</p>
<h3>Song's Dilemma</h3>
<p>In short, Minister Song has made great contributions to finance and construction in the past. This resignation is due to the fact that the country's finances have reached the extreme of difficulty. Otherwise, Minister Song has been in difficulties for many years, planning and calculating to overcome many difficulties. Now why must he be so determined? Based on the situation, it is out of desperation. At the same time, it is also a clear indication that the finance has reached a critical point. If we do not engage in reducing expenditure and avoid consumption in the future, we will not be able to overcome this difficulty. Therefore, in the future, all walks of life in the military and political circles should be aware of this, so that the whole country can work together to help the government overcome the difficulties, and then can embark on the road of budget balance and focus on construction.</p>
<h3>Economic Construction</h3>
<p>After Minister Song resigned as Finance Minister, the Central Government will ask him to devote himself to the Economic Commission and international technical cooperation matters. Because our country's industry is backward and its national power is weak, we must catch up and cannot be balanced in the international community. Therefore, the Central Government attaches great importance to economic construction. Minister Song's knowledge and experience are admired by the people of the country, and international technical cooperation with China, and the cotton and wheat loan, were all negotiated by Minister Song. It is expected that in the future, China's economic construction work will be led by Song.</p>
<h3>At the Beginning of the Assignment</h3>
<p>I was ordered to be the Minister of Finance this time. I did not do well in financial management, so I felt ashamed and did not dare to accept it. The government's appointment of officials is like the country's conscription of soldiers. Since I have been conscripted, it is difficult to refuse. Moreover, General Chiang Kai-shek and Premier Wang all said that I should not only be the Minister of Finance in name, but also take responsibility. All members of the National Government should assume this responsibility and help everything. Even if Minister Song leaves his post, he will do his best to help. I dare not refuse. In the future, I vow to take the cultivation of tax sources, the promotion of people's benefits, and the restoration of social vitality as my responsibilities.</p>
<h3>The Vice Minister's Problem</h3>
<p>As for the Vice Minister's problem, although there are various rumors in the outside world, none of them can be believed. Because the two Vice Ministers, Zou and Li, are both my acquaintances. Before the Northern Expedition of the Revolutionary Army, when I was the Director of Finance of Guangdong, the two Vice Ministers were both my assistants. In the future, they will still be able to assist me. Although there is a customary practice in the Chinese officialdom to advance and retreat together, the two Vice Ministers' resignation may be due to humility. It will not affect the relationship between personal advancement and retreat. Because I have not yet taken office, it is difficult to talk about it in detail for a while. However, I firmly believe that the two Vice Ministers will be able to help me and the country. It is not true that Yu (Feipeng), Vice Minister of Transportation, will be the Vice Minister. Vice Minister Yu is a great talent. If he can help me, I will be overjoyed. However, now that the military affairs of bandit suppression are tense, it is very important to handle military station transportation. I am afraid it is difficult to leave easily.</p>
<h3>Unemployed Workers Demand Relief, Shanghai-Peiping Direct Freight Train Blocked, Goods Temporarily Unloaded, Ferried Across the River, Shanghai-Peiping Direct Passenger Train Runs as Usual,</h3>
<p>Following the opening of the Capital Railway Ferry on the 22nd of this month, the Ministry of Railways ordered the Shanghai-Peiping, Tientsin-Pukow, and Peiping-Ningkow Railways to begin direct joint freight transport on the 28th of this month. Unemployed dockworkers at Pukow riverfront demanded relief, leading to the blockage of direct freight trains. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Workers Demand Relief</p>
<p>After the Ministry of Railways planned to construct the Capital Railway Ferry, the dockworkers at the Pukow riverfront of the Tientsin-Pukow Railway and the dockworkers at the Nanking riverfront of the Shanghai-Nanking Railway, fearing that the completion of the railway ferry would eliminate the need for loading and unloading, resulting in sudden unemployment, separately requested relief from the Ministry of Railways, Nanking Social Bureau, and the Tientsin-Pukow and Shanghai-Nanking Railways. The Ministry of Railways instructed the railway bureaus to find ways to accommodate the unemployed dockworkers. The Tientsin-Pukow and Shanghai-Nanking Railways replied to the dockworkers, promising to find ways to accommodate them at various freight stations. However, the Pukow riverfront dockworkers of the Tientsin-Pukow Railway, noting that the Capital Railway Ferry had already opened, and that the Railway Bureau's promise to find ways to accommodate them at various freight stations had not materialized, learned that the Shanghai-Peiping direct joint freight transport would commence on the 28th, with daily departures from Shanghai and Peiping. A meeting was held to decide to continue demanding relief, leading to the blockage of direct freight trains.</p>
<p>Direct Freight Train Blocked</p>
<p>On the 28th, Freight Train No. 402, bound for Peiping, departed from Shanghai's Macgregor Road Station at 5:20 PM. It arrived at the Nanking riverfront at 6:40 AM on the 29th. Due to the obstruction by dockworkers at Pukow of the Tientsin-Pukow Railway, it was temporarily halted before boarding the ferry. Fearing that the cargo would be delayed, the goods were unloaded by dockworkers and loaded onto civilian boats to cross the river, landing at Pukow, and then reloaded onto Tientsin-Pukow Railway cars heading to Peiping. As for Freight Train No. 401, bound for Shanghai, which departed from Peiping's Chienmen Station at 10:36 PM on the 28th, it arrived at the Pukow riverfront at 5:25 AM yesterday. Due to the obstruction by dockworkers at Pukow, it was unable to board the ferry to cross the river. The original schedule to arrive at Shanghai's Macgregor Road Station at 6:00 AM this morning would be delayed. The Shanghai-Peiping freight train was temporarily suspended.</p>
<p>After receiving the report, the Shanghai-Nanking Railway Administration announced on the 29th that the Shanghai-Peiping direct joint freight transport would be temporarily suspended. Goods from Shanghai bound for the Tientsin-Pukow and Peiping-Ningkow Railways were reloaded onto Shanghai-Nanking freight cars Nos. 311 to 316 and transported to Nanking, ferried across the river, and then reloaded onto Tientsin-Pukow Railway cars heading north. As for the Pukow dockworkers' obstruction of freight cars from boarding the ferry, the Tientsin-Pukow Railway Administration, in addition to sending personnel to persuade the workers, reloaded the goods bound for the Shanghai-Nanking Railway onto freight cars to transport to Pukow, ferry across the river, and then reloaded onto Shanghai-Nanking Railway cars heading south. The Shanghai-Peiping direct joint freight train was thus temporarily suspended. Passenger and freight traffic continues as usual.</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Peiping direct joint express passenger train, with daily departures from Shanghai and Peiping, Train Nos. 301 and 302, since the opening of the Capital Ferry on the 22nd of this month, the Pukow dockworkers' obstruction only affected the Shanghai-Peiping freight trains. The Shanghai-Peiping passenger trains continue to run as usual, unaffected by the dockworkers' strike. Train No. 302, which departed from Shanghai at 12:00 last night, and Train No. 301, which departed from Peiping at 7:15 PM last night, both ran as usual.</p>
<p>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Negotiates with Tatung Shipping Company</p>
<p>Civilian Shipping Competition Can Be Resolved</p>
<p>The Ministry of Railways and China Merchants Steam Navigation Company have agreed on a national water-land joint transportation plan, which is scheduled to be implemented from today. The general joint transportation contract is expected to be signed soon. Agreements have been reached on all aspects of the joint transportation plan, including remedial measures and assistance for private companies, and the matter is gradually moving toward a resolution. The information obtained by our reporter is detailed below.</p>
<p>Appointment of Special Commissioner</p>
<p>In this water-land joint transportation plan, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company gains preferential rights over all eleven main railway lines in the country, thus the scope is extremely broad. China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is establishing a separate department to handle the joint transportation business. General Manager Liu Hongsheng, in consultation with the Head of Business Department, He Molin, decided to add a joint transportation section, located to the right of the General Affairs Office. Economist Zhou Fengdu has been appointed as the head of the joint transportation section. Clerical staff will be transferred from the Business Department, and additional staff will be added if necessary. Zhou has already reported to the company for duty, but the joint transportation section is still under the jurisdiction of the Business Department. In addition, Shen Youzhi, the director of the Haichow Bureau, has resigned. A new director has been internally appointed and will be announced in a day or two.</p>
<p>Port Relocation</p>
<p>The temporary pier at Lao Yao on the Lunghai Railway is nearing completion. Transportation from Dapu Port will be discontinued from today. All sections of the Railway Bureau located at Dapu Port, responsible for local water transportation, have been ordered to relocate to Lao Yao. Their mission will be changed to managing the port affairs of the West Lien Island. Dapu Port will be completely abandoned. Employees of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's docks and warehouses have also received orders from the General Bureau to relocate to the new dock at Lao Yao and to complete all tasks at Dapu.</p>
<p>Relief for Civilian Shipping</p>
<p>Since China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Ministry of Railways agreed on the water-land joint transportation contract, various private shipping companies along the Lunghai Railway have voiced their opposition. Companies such as Tatung have repeatedly telegraphed the Ministry of Railways, requesting to join the joint transportation plan. The Ministry rejected their requests but telegraphed China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, instructing them to come up with a sound plan for the aftermath. Liu Hongsheng has held multiple discussions with the authorities of Tatung Shipping Company, stating that with the abandonment of Haichow and Dapu, and the relocation of the company's ships to Lao Yao, private shipping companies will have little business in the Haichow area. China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is considering a cooperative method for Tatung's Yong Ping, Yong An, and Yong Ji ships, which will not hinder either private shipping or the joint transportation plan. Liu will present this matter to the Board of Directors, and upon approval, he will begin drafting a preliminary contract with Tatung to safeguard the three ships. The matter is currently under secret negotiation.</p>
<p>Allocation of Goods</p>
<p>Yesterday, it was rumored that the Wuhan-Changsha Railway joint transportation would be handled by Sanpei Shipping Company because they had more ships. Yesterday, our reporter inquired with the joint transportation authorities, who stated that this was baseless. Since the Ministry of Railways has signed a contract with China Merchants Steam Navigation Company for the entire joint transportation plan, it would not make sense to assign a particular railway to a private company. The Wuhan-Changsha Railway joint transportation will also be handled by China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. However, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, considering the interdependence between private shipping companies, is willing to adopt a cooperative approach and distribute the remaining cargo to various private shipping companies for loading. China Merchants Steam Navigation Company does not have the tonnage capacity to load all of the country's commercial goods. This matter is currently under comprehensive planning.</p>
<p>Review of Contract</p>
<p>The general contract for the water-land joint transportation plan is signed between the Ministry of Railways and China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. The eleven railway lines across the country will each negotiate detailed rules for the joint transportation of goods with China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. However, the detailed rules of each railway must not contradict the Ministry of Railways' joint transportation contract. Therefore, the detailed rules of each railway must be approved by the Ministry before they can take effect. As for the Ministry of Railways' general joint transportation contract, it was still under review at a meeting in the Ministry yesterday. Once it is revised and approved, it will be brought to Shanghai for signing.

<p>Yesterday's Dispute Between the Fukienese Community and China Merchants Steam Navigation Company</p>
<p>Yesterday's newspaper reported the declaration of facts by the Fukienese community and China Merchants Steam Navigation Company regarding their cooperative association, and the letter from the Sanshan Guild Hall requesting correction. We will now record yesterday's news.</p>
<p>The Chiangsi Northern Fukienese Merchants Guild sent a letter stating: "According to factual evidence, it seems that the National Goods Introduction Bureau is the origin, but it is not known that the Chiangsi community existed before. The Chiangsi community's cloth business has always held the leading position in the four prefectures of northern Fukien. In the past, purchases were mostly made from Fukien. Since the Republic of China, we have established Shanghai branches, and our business has become even more developed, which has diminished the luster of the Fukienese community. This is a major taboo. In 1919, the Hsinchi steamboat encountered pirates after running aground, and insurance did not cover the losses. The Fukienese community agreed to deduct two taels per thousand taels of cargo as compensation and added cargo insurance, as well as the original incense money, making it even more difficult to compete with the Chiangsi community. Therefore, relying on the strength of the entire community, they used the majority of miscellaneous grains and fruits to coerce various shipping companies to refuse to load cotton yarn and cloth from the Chiangsi community to Fukien. After the Chiangsi community directly negotiated with various shipping companies, the Shipping Association discussed the matter, and justice was served. Loading was resumed as usual. Unexpectedly, in early September this year, when the communists disturbed the upper reaches of Fukien, the Sanshan Guild Hall took the opportunity to send a letter to various shipping companies, again refusing to load cotton yarn and cloth from the Chiangsi community to Fukien, repeating the bullying. We cannot tolerate this. For the sake of supplying the market, on October 11th, we entrusted Hengmao Foreign Firm to load 40 pieces of cotton yarn and cloth onto the Wanxiang steamboat. On the 26th, we entrusted Shanghai Lighterage Company to report 67 pieces of cargo for the Wanxiang steamboat, but all were rejected. The original goods are still stored in the warehouse. We are grateful that Mr. Yu Qiaqing agreed to hold a discussion in the Shipping Association to find a solution, and we hope for a satisfactory response. Now, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, as a state-owned shipping company, is the first to publish an advertisement, widely soliciting Fukienese goods, which is commendable for treating everyone equally and seeing through their tricks. In summary, the Sanshan community has indeed monopolized the market, suppressed compatriots, dominated shipping, and sought private gain, which is unacceptable to justice and difficult to tolerate. We hereby report the entire matter in the hope of a fair judgment. Please publish this in the local news of the Shen Pao.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Citizens' Association for Promoting National Goods has repeatedly received reports from member factories such as the American-Asian Silk Weaving Factory that Fukienese merchants oppose the promotion of national goods and threaten various commercial shipping companies to stop loading. Yesterday, a letter was sent to the Sanshan Guild Hall requesting explanation and resolution in order to maintain national goods. The original letter stated: "We have received reports from members of our association, such as the American-Asian Silk Weaving Factory, stating that in order to promote trade in southern Fukien and directly sell their products, they have been well received by local stores, which have placed orders. However, some Fukienese merchants stationed in Shanghai, seeking only profit, have spared no effort to oppose them and have threatened various commercial shipping companies with stopping loading goods to Fukien, threatening to secretly sign private agreements to refuse to load national goods. Not only are the products of various factories affected, but also the work of promoting national goods is undermined. The cause of saving the country through the national goods movement is extremely important. We earnestly request your guild to provide relief. Promoting national goods is the basic work under the serious situation of national crisis and dumping of foreign goods. Promoting production is the only reasonable business of each factory. Freedom of business is granted by law. National merchants stationed in Shanghai oppose the promotion of national goods and coerce commercial shipping companies to refuse to load them. This is not a sign of cherishing national goods and cooperation between industry and commerce. We have always admired your guild for leading the masses and being enthusiastic about patriotism. We hope that you will earnestly persuade the merchants of your guild to withdraw their outdated and murderous plan and promptly explain and resolve the misunderstanding. The national economy and people's livelihood are deeply dependent on this. We hope that you will investigate and handle this matter. We look forward to your reply and reiterate our public commitment."</p>
<p>Marine Engineers Request Equal Treatment, Submission to the Ministry</p>
<p>The Chinese Marine Engineers Union stated that the treatment of marine engineers by China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is not as good as that of captains, causing dissatisfaction among all marine engineers and brewing a labor dispute. Yesterday, they submitted a request to the Ministry of Communications to revise the salary scale in order to resolve the dispute. The original submission stated: "We hereby submit a request to revise the salaries of marine engineers at China Merchants Steam Navigation Company in order to ensure fairness and maintain the livelihood of sailors. Our union members, who are marine engineers at China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, have previously submitted a joint request by Qian Xiangshan and sixty other individuals on June 12th of this year to China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to establish a salary scale for marine engineers, requesting equal treatment with deck officers. They also reiterated their request on September 6th in the name of the Marine Engineers Union of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. The matter has been delayed for several months. The company has only recently replied, stating that the salaries of marine engineers have recently been investigated and reported to the Ministry of Communications for review, and the company will comply with the Ministry's established salary regulations. In addition, the Ministry issued Directive No. 5113 in the "Ministry of Communications Gazette," stating, "Captains and marine engineers serve on the same ship, and their importance is equal. However, the treatment of marine engineers by various shipping companies is extremely unfair. We are formulating investigation forms to determine the salary levels of sailors at all levels and ordering various shipping companies to comply in order to improve the treatment of sailors and maintain maritime safety." We have seen that the Ministry has insight into this abnormal situation and is striving to improve the unfair treatment. The benefits to marine engineers are not insignificant. The long-standing issue of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has now been referred to the Ministry. Our union will present the actual situation in detail for consideration and implementation. In foreign shipping companies, the treatment of captains, chief mates, and chief engineers, and first and second assistant engineers are equal at all levels. The salary distribution and all facilities for the two departments are equal. However, in our state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, under the banner of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People and economic equality, marine engineers are discriminated against, given lower salaries for the same level of responsibility. Although the duties of the deck and engine departments are different, their ranks are the same. Now, one is favored while the other is treated poorly, and the salaries are vastly different. How can this be justified? Wherever there is profit, everyone flocks to it. The number of trainees practicing to be captains at China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is greater than the number of trainees practicing to be marine engineers. The main reason for this is the preferential treatment given to captains. They are of the same rank, but the treatment is different. Sailors will see the position of captain as a lucky path and the engine department as a dead end. How can the shipping industry be developed and future generations be inspired? Furthermore, general shipping companies have the practice of giving sailors annual raises. However, the treatment of marine engineers is already unequal, and the hope of a raise is zero. Not only that, but the salaries of marine engineers serving at China Merchants Steam Navigation Company are gradually decreasing. For example, the original food allowance for a chief engineer was 45 yuan per month, and for first, second, and third assistant engineers, it was 35 yuan per month. Now, the food allowance is uniformly reduced to 25 yuan. In addition, the aviation donation is deducted from the salary for six months, ranging from 3% to 6%. Starting in August of this year, income tax is also deducted. There is no raise, but the ways to reduce salaries are numerous. Since August of this year, the salaries of all department employees at China Merchants Steam Navigation Company have been increased, ranging from 10 yuan to 60 yuan per month. Marine engineers are also employees of state-owned agencies, and they feel the pain of unequal treatment compared to the deck department. Furthermore, deductions from food allowances and the collection of donations and taxes are reducing the original salaries. It seems that reductions without increases, and penalties without rewards, and unequal treatment are all seen under the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. What is the meaning of the Three Principles of the People? What about economic equality? If this continues, the pain of being exploited will be felt, and in order to make a living, the pressure will become unbearable. I am afraid that like a gunpowder magazine experiencing extremely high temperatures, an explosion is inevitable. The union has repeatedly received complaints from the marine engineers, and it is difficult to sit idly by. Fortunately, the Ministry is aware of this absurdity and is striving to improve it, which is gratifying. However, it is important to act quickly, identify the root cause, and immediately establish a salary scale to prevent problems before they occur. If the investigation is prolonged and the matter is delayed, it will not only be like seeking a maker of wine at a dried fish shop, but it will also lead to sailors taking risks. We are submitting the documents presented to the company for your review. We request that you establish a fair salary scale based on the Ministry's Directive No. 5113 and order China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to comply in order to resolve the situation and prevent accidents."</p>
<p>Liu Yin-fa is Still Alive</p>
<p>The case of Korean Liu Yin-fa, who lived in the Fifth District Third Precinct in northern Shanghai, being assassinated at home on August 27th, was ordered by the Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Wen Hong-en, to be investigated by the Chief of the Fifth District Third Precinct, Wen Yi-shan, with a strict deadline to apprehend the perpetrators. An order was also issued to all district stations and teams to cooperate in the investigation. However, the deadline has long passed, and the case has not been solved. Another deadline of 15 days was set to solve the case, failing which there would be consequences. Later, on September 8th, a suspect in the case, Kim Shui-shan (a Chinese), was apprehended and sent to the headquarters for interrogation. However, after Liu Yin-fa was attacked, he was sent by Japanese police to the Fukumin Hospital established by the Japanese for treatment. The Japanese doctors diligently treated him, and he gradually recovered and was discharged from the hospital. He did not die. After learning of this, Chief Wen sent Officer Zhang Peng-yi to investigate. Zhang Peng-yi found that Liu Yin-fa had indeed been discharged from the hospital a week ago. Yesterday, he submitted a report to the headquarters on his findings for review.</p>

<p>Fire Destroys Three Streets in the Old City Temple, Electric Lamp Booth Explodes, Candles Ignite the Fire, Fire Engines from All Over Are Dispatched, More Than Twenty Businesses Destroyed, Arsonist Flees in Fear, Guarantor Detained</p>
<p>At 5:50 PM yesterday, a sudden fire broke out on Anren Street in the Old City Temple, engulfing Yu Garden Road and Hsianghsueh Road, affecting more than twenty households. Several people were unaccounted for, and some jumped from buildings and were injured. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Electric Lights Go Out</p>
<p>At 5:30 PM last night, the electric lamp booth installed at Chishen Temple near the Old City Temple suddenly exploded, causing the electric lights in the area to go out completely. Various businesses and shops temporarily lit candles while waiting for repairs. Twenty minutes passed, but the power had not returned. Unexpectedly, while it was still dark, a fire alarm was suddenly raised on Anren Street at the East Gate of the Temple. Although the fire brigade in front of the Temple, which was nearby, quickly dispatched a fire engine, the fire had already spread rapidly and was uncontrollable.</p>
<p>Fire from Rosin</p>
<p>The shop at No. 148 Anren Street, opened by Chang Hsueh-wen (age 28, wife Chen) from Changchou, specializes in manufacturing artificial jade. Most of the raw materials used are flammable substances such as rosin. When the electric lights went out, the shop also lit candles to continue working. Accidentally, a spark fell into a box of rosin, immediately starting a fire. Although the workers tried their best to put out the fire, the fire had already spread to the roof beams and was out of reach. The sirens blared, and panic ensued, spreading to the surrounding areas.</p>
<p>When the fire broke out, Ni Lin-chang, a member of the North District Fire Brigade, happened to be passing by. He rushed to the brigade to report the fire and immediately dispatched the Keilai pump truck to deliver water first. He also used a small pump to go around to Fuyou Road to assist in the firefighting. He then dispatched the Flying Iron No. 1 truck to the vicinity of the Simeihsuan Teahouse on Hsianghsueh Road to try his best to extinguish the fire. However, the nearby shops were all similar material shops and calligraphy and painting stores, which ignited immediately upon contact with fire. It felt like trying to put out a cartload of faggots with a cup of water, making it difficult to extinguish the fire. He then requested assistance from the United Fire Brigade. Within about ten minutes, fire trucks from various districts arrived in succession.</p>
<p>Three Main Streets</p>
<p>Fire trucks from all districts rushed to the scene to assist in the intense shooting of water. After two hours, the fire began to subside slightly. In this fire, a total of three main streets, Anren Street, Yu Garden Road, and Hsianghsueh Road, were affected. On Anren Street, odd-numbered addresses from No. 139 to No. 149, and even-numbered addresses from No. 140 to No. 148, were affected. On Yu Garden Road, the addresses from No. 212 in the south to No. 218 in the north were affected. On Hsianghsueh Road, odd-numbered addresses from No. 1 in the north to No. 9 in the south were affected (only the upper floors of these numbers were destroyed).</p>
<p>On Anren Street</p>
<p>On Anren Street, starting from No. 148, the fire spread to No. 146, Hsiecheng General Merchandise Store (owner Shih Peng-ming), No. 144, Wang Techih Sparrow Tile Shop (Wang Teh-hsiang), No. 142, Lu Tan-liang Paper Shop, No. 141, Sen Tai Artificial Jade (store Wang Chen-fu), No. 143, Chen Tung-fa Bamboo Chopstick Shop (Chen Chiu-pao), No. 145, Wang Pao-feng Artificial Jade Shop (Wang Yu-chien), No. 147, Mao Fu-chi Material Shop (Mao Wen-hsi), and No. 149, Lung Da-tung Board Box Shop.</p>
<p>In Yu Garden Road</p>
<p>The affected households on Yu Garden Road include No. 208, Tsuihua Tang Calligraphy and Painting Shop (Yang Kai-hsiang), No. 212, Chinglien Shih Calligraphy and Painting Shop (Feng Ching-shan), No. 214, Sanyouhsuan Calligraphy and Painting Shop (Yu Keng-sheng), No. 216, Yichintang Calligraphy and Painting Shop (Fang Shou-sheng), No. 118, Chinglien Shih Branch (Feng Ching-shan), and No. 220, Chunyu Lou Teahouse (Shen Teng-shih).</p>
<p>Beside Hsianghsueh Road</p>
<p>On Hsianghsueh Road, the affected businesses were No. 1, Hsin Ku-chai Antique Shop (Chang Pao-sheng), No. 3, Ku Sung-chi Antique Shop (Ku Teh-chang), and No. 4, Simeihsuan Teahouse (Li Chi-huan suffered the least loss). Among those injured at the scene were the wife of Yu Hsiang-pai, from No. 148 Anren Street, who injured her lower body and was sent to the Red Cross Hospital. Wang Chao-shih's twelve-year-old daughter, Wang Ah-mao, injured her head and was sent to Jenji Hospital. The whereabouts of Chen Simei's four-year-old son, Ah-rong, are unknown.</p>
<p>Arsonist Flees</p>
<p>Liu Yun-fang, the chief of the First District Second Precinct, personally led several police officers to the scene to investigate. He also ordered the arrest of the arsonist, but he had already fled in fear. After reviewing the household registration, the guarantor was found to be Wu Hsing-hua, the owner of the Hsingfu Artificial Jade Shop at No. 417 Fuyou Road. Wu lived at No. 21 Lin Yin Lane, Lin Yin Road. When the police arrived at Wu's shop, Wu was not there, so his partner, Hsia Yin-cheng, was detained pending transfer to the headquarters for review.</p>

<p>Three Perpetrators Involved in the Kidnapping of Ku Tsung-hsing for Ransom are Being Tried Together, Chien Hsing-chuan Jumps from a Window in an Attempt to Escape and is Injured, Chou Yi-fu and His Son Were Actually the Masterminds</p>
<p>Ku Tsung-hsing, the owner of the Changtaihsing Cosmetics Store at No. 39 Wing An Lane, Yunnan Road, was kidnapped on the morning of the 8th of this month. He left his residence at No. 5 Tungfu Lane, Chulai Road, in the French Concession at 9:00 AM, intending to go to his store. While waiting for a streetcar on Tungfu Road, he was lured by his relative, Chou Yi-fu from Shaohsing, and Chou's son, Chou Sheng-san (also known as Chou Shou-chen), to their secret telephone station. They then conspired to detain Ku. His family paid a ransom of $4,000 to secure his release. This matter came to the attention of Lu Lien-kuei, the Inspector General of the General Inspectorate, who dispatched Deputy Inspector Feng Tzu-ming, Agent Chang Yun-hung, and others to arrest the Chou family. Details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. We now know that Ku Tsung-hsing was released on ransom on the 20th of this month. On the 26th, Inspector General Lu discovered that the suspect Chien Hsing-chuan was hiding in a house at No. 200 Peilun Road, Hongkew. He led Deputy Inspector Feng and others to surround and arrest him. Chien attempted to escape by jumping from a window, but he was injured upon landing and could not escape. He was apprehended and taken back to the police station for questioning. Due to the severity of his injuries, he was sent to the hospital for treatment. Based on his confession and the circumstances of the kidnapping, it was determined that the Chou family was the mastermind. Therefore, at 9:30 AM the day before yesterday, in conjunction with police detectives from the Fifth District Police Station, they rushed to the Chou family's residence at No. 20 De En Lane, Yinkuei Road, and arrested the Chou family. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special District District Court and interrogated by Judge Wu Tse-han. According to the police lawyer, Ju Pao-yi, the suspect Chien is currently in the hospital. He requested that the two Chous be detained for investigation and prosecution along with Chien. Judge Wu briefly questioned the Chou family and ordered them to be detained pending further interrogation.</p>

<p>Campfire Meeting Success</p>
<p>Last night's campfire meeting was attended by nearly 2,000 people. The vast Zhenjiang County Sports Field was filled with shadows and a sea of heads. Originally, it was planned to light the fire in the center of the field, but due to the large number of people, it was difficult to maintain order. Later, it was moved to the front of the rostrum, led by the commander, and the ceremony was performed. The Scout song was sung aloud by everyone. At this point, the highly anticipated campfire meeting began. First, the drum and bugle corps of the 665th Troop (Mount San) played a "Great March" with coordinated rhythms and modulations. When performing the "Seven Clever Lanterns," they were arranged into a sailboat and then transformed into a pagoda, changing in a very flexible and impressive way, winning the audience's praise. This was followed by a martial arts performance by the 165th, 167th, and 168th Troops, which was relatively skilled. Afterwards, the kitchen band of the 60th Troop (Jiangdu) was humorous and amusing, with orderly steps. A group of female cooks sang with melodious voices, and the sounds of pots, ladles, and copper spoons were pleasing to the ear. The 150th Troop's lion dance was quite meaningful. At first, it was a sleeping lion, then suddenly awakened, followed by wolves and jackals with ambition. After a roar of anger, they were all defeated. The lion's eyes were made with two flashlights, emitting a radiant light, which was very eye-catching. Finally, there was the "Savage Dance" by the 211th Troop (Wuxi). Many savages with pheasant feathers in their hair and ghost masks on their faces first performed, like a martial arts troupe in the field. Later, many savages appeared, accompanied by an accordion, harmonica, and Connaught. Many savages sang the "Savage Dance" song. This troupe performed martial arts, dance, and singing, with everything you could want. The audience applauded. As a result of the large number of people and the chaotic order, 4/10 of the performances were left to be continued tonight.</p>

<h3>Zhang Ji and Others Initiate the Establishment of the Renqing Memorial School</h3>
<p>Office established in Shanghai</p>
<p>Party and national leaders Zhang Ji, Lin Cha, Jiang Zhongzheng, Wang Jingwei and others, in memory of General Xia Renqing, who sacrificed himself for the country, jointly initiated the establishment of the Renqing Memorial School. An office has been set up at No. 446 Baileni Leslang Road in the French Concession of Shanghai and is actively proceeding. It is reported that the school will give special preferential treatment to children from poor families, descendants of martyrs, and overseas Chinese in the future, and will also strive to increase the salary and treatment of teachers. The situation is recorded below.</p>
<p>Origin of Establishment</p>
<p>Martyr Xia Renqing sacrificed himself for the revolution and made contributions to the party and the country. The National Government has already issued an order to commend him. His wife can know this. Ji and others either studied with the martyr in the past, or were comrades in arms. In the past, they were familiar with the martyr's virtues and knowledge. As a person, he was determined and taciturn, decisive in matters, firm and resourceful, and honest in his actions. He was also devoted to the revolution, single-minded and united, loyal and enterprising, and courageous and not violating benevolence. In the blink of an eye, he was killed by the hands of reactionaries. The Premier praised him and said that his death could be a model for others. Today, the customs are degenerating, and people are flooded with depravity. The cunning ones change their morals, compete for power and seek personal gain. One or two pure and honest people are living in seclusion and minding their own business. Revolution must first reform the heart. If people's hearts are like this, it is a worry for our party. Ji and others recall the past and plan to establish the Renqing Memorial School. It not only celebrates the martyr's name and deeds and celebrates the martyr's achievements, but also teaches in recitation, so that the martyr's great spirit and steadfast integrity can penetrate into the minds of students, so as to correct the current customs, revitalize the current decline, and further be willing to inherit the martyr's will and promote the great cause of revolution. The ancients had a saying, "High mountains are looked up to, and great deeds are followed." Even if they cannot reach it, their hearts yearn for it. It is hoped that virtuous people at home and abroad will remember the martyr's loyalty and Ji and others' ambition to cultivate people together.</p>

<h3>Binhai Middle School Invites Li Shicen to Lecture</h3>
<p>The topic is "Modern Youth's Outlook on Life"</p>
<p>The private Binhai Middle School on Albay Road in Shanghai has spared no effort in planning since its establishment. People in the education circle have regarded it as a rising star. The school term has been going on for a long time this season. The school feels that extracurricular lectures are indispensable. Mr. Li Shicen was specially invited to the school at 1:00 PM the day before yesterday to give a lecture entitled "Modern Youth's Outlook on Life." More than 200 students attended, which was a grand occasion for a while. It was also heard that the school students are actively preparing for a lecture competition to prepare for training.</p>
<h3>Philippine Overseas Chinese Won the Basketball Game Last Night Against Datong</h3>
<p>Result: 51 to 24</p>
<p>Datong's basketball skills have plummeted.</p>
<p>Philippine Overseas Chinese showed their skills.</p>
<p>The Philippine Overseas Chinese basketball team played a friendly match with the Datong team at the Chinese Basketball Hall last night. Due to the absence of Chen Baoqiu, Datong's strength was greatly reduced, its advances and retreats were disordered, and its shooting was inaccurate. The Philippine team has a long-standing reputation and easily won the game. Last night, they took turns to fight, and never used the official lineup to play, so the battle between the two sides was not very exciting. The Philippine team passed the ball quickly and had many clever moves. From beginning to end, they led the way. Datong found it difficult to resist, and their clumsiness was revealed. One side was mighty and unstoppable, and the other side was disorganized and distracted. The first half was 21 to 8. The final result was 51 to 24. The Philippine team won. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>Philippine Overseas Chinese: Throws, Fouls, Points</p>
<p>Lin Dengru: 7, 4, 28</p>
<p>Cai Yuelang: 3, 1, 7</p>

<h3>Jiangda Tennis Finals Jiaotong University Retains Men's Championship</h3>
<p>A Fierce Battle Victory Over Fudan by a Score of 3-2</p>
<p>Central University Retains Women's Championship Victory Over Guanghua</p>
<p>The results of yesterday's finals of the Jiangnan Eight University Tennis Championships, both men's and women's groups: Jiaotong University defeated Fudan 3-2 and retained the men's championship, while Central University defeated Guanghua in all three groups and retained the women's championship. The women's group situation tilted to one side, while the men's group, Jiaotong and Fudan fought hard before the victory was decided. A summary of the results is as follows:</p>
<p>Central University vs. Guanghua (Women)</p>
<p>Central University's Liu Yulan and Chen Qing defeated Guanghua's Guo Shaohui and Bao Lengxue in both singles and one doubles match, almost leaving Guanghua with nothing. Liu Yulan defeated Guo Shaohui in two sets, Bao Lengxue only scored one game against Chen Qing, and the doubles match was also two sets, which was also very ruthless. The two Central University players won steadily with their strokes, and rarely made mistakes, especially Liu Yulan. Mao Yuwen was defeated by her 6-0, 6-0, which shows how strong she is.</p>
<p>(1) Liu Yulan (Central) (6-0, 6-0) Guo Shaohui (Guanghua)</p>
<p>(2) Chen Qing (Central) (6-1, 6-0) Bao Lengxue (Guanghua)</p>
<p>(3) Liu Yulan, Chen Qing (Central) (6-0, 6-0) Bao Lengxue, Guo Shaohui (Guanghua)</p>
<p>Jiaotong vs. Fudan (Men)</p>
<p>The men's final between Jiaotong and Fudan was completely different from the women's. The victory or defeat was unpredictable. Jiaotong won one doubles match with more singles wins, and Fudan's defeat in the first singles match by Ma Canzhou was the key to Jiaotong's victory. The results of the five matches are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Xiong Daji (Jiaotong) (6-4, 6-4, 6-0) Ma Canzhou (Fudan)</p>
<p>(2) Liang Deguang (Fudan) (6-3, 6-4, 3-6, 6-3) Mao Yu Gong (Jiaotong)</p>
<p>(3) Chen Xianzhang (Jiaotong) (3-6, 6-2, 0-6, 6-0, 6-2) Zhuang Shouchi (Fudan)</p>
<p>(4) Liang Deguang, Ma Canzhou (Fudan) (3-6, 6-4, 7-5, 6-3) Chen Xianzhang, Mao Yu Gong (Jiaotong)</p>
<p>(5) Xiong Daji, Zheng De Zhang (Jiaotong) (6-3, 4-6, 6-2, 6-3) Zhuang Shouchi, Feng Yipei (Fudan)</p>
<p>Unit: The failure of Fudan's first singles player Ma Canzhou to Jiaotong's Xiong Daji was the key to the overall victory or defeat, because the other four matches had a 90% chance of winning or losing. Based on the results of Ma Canzhou's match against Datong on the second day, his failure was unexpected. Xiong Daji is a strong player at the baseline. There is no doubt that Jiaotong's second singles player Mao Yu Gong will be defeated by Liang Deguang. It is not easy to win one set, and the performance on the day was particularly good. The victory of the third singles player Chen Xianzhang over Fudan's Zhuang Shouchi was unexpected. It was expected beforehand that it would be easy to win.</p>
<p>Doubles</p>
<p>Each team also won one doubles match. It was a major event for Liang Deguang and Zhou Canzhou to win over Chen Xianzhang and Mao Yu Gong. Fudan's victory was entirely in the hands of Liang alone. After Chen and Mao won the first set, they lost the third set after a hard battle, so there was no chance. Jiaotong won the second doubles match, also after a fierce battle. Fudan's ball skills are relatively poor, so there is nothing exciting about it.</p>

<p>A Conversation with Shirley Temple Regarding Her Departure from Paramount - Declaring the Reason for Leaving - Ailing Body Unable to Continue Work</p>
<h3>(Source Omitted)</h3>
<p>"I am not rebellious. Nor am I acting on impulse. I don't believe in disruptive tricks. The only reason I left Paramount and didn't co-star with Chevalier in 'The Smiling Lieutenant' is that my body is too weak to continue. After I recover, I still want to return to Paramount, and Paramount is waiting for me to return for a second film."</p>
<p>The above is what Shirley Temple, the star of "Madame Butterfly," told a female reporter from "Screen" magazine. After Shirley announced her departure from Paramount, everyone suspected that this gentle and lovely girl had also caught the celebrity disease, dissatisfied with the work assigned to her, and rebelled. Of course, Shirley Temple has become a famous star since the success of "Madame Butterfly." She certainly wouldn't want to be demoted to a supporting role. So, many people thought her illness was a "politically motivated illness." However, according to the female reporter from "Screen," Shirley Temple was indeed very ill when she spoke with her. Although she said she was better than she had been in the past few weeks, she was still pale, thin as a rail, and her two blue eyes seemed even larger. She needs a long period of rest.</p>
<p>Shirley Temple's illness is a rare and peculiar one. Her salivary glands have undergone a mutation that causes the saliva to harden and become stony. She has had this disease for three years, and her health has weakened day by day. Recently, she underwent a procedure to remove the stony masses. Paramount urged her not to rest, but they didn't know that this was Shirley Temple's third surgery.</p>
<p>"The first two times I had the procedure, they didn't say a word," Shirley Temple said, "because those two times were in between films and didn't interfere with work. When I was filming 'Ladies of the Big House,' I had an attack, rested for two days, and then continued working. After that film was finished, I had the first surgery. The second time was after filming 'The Miracle Man,' and that time the incision was made in my left gum. Recently, while filming 'The Way to Love,' the old illness relapsed and was very severe. I endured the pain and worked for five days. The cameraman could only film one side of my face, but I continued working. Finally, my doctor said that surgery was unavoidable, so I had the surgery on July 14th. Ten days later, Paramount sent several doctors to diagnose me and determine my condition. But they examined me superficially and reported back that she would soon be able to return to work and that it would not cause much hindrance to her health. But both sides of my face are swollen high. If I were a typist, perhaps I could work; but I am an actress. How can I film a movie in this condition, when I can't even speak properly?</p>
<p>"My private doctor told me that I must have a long rest. Also, my illness has been delayed for too long, and there may be trouble in the future. There are various dangers, such as stones that have not been completely removed, or the invasion of bacteria after the incision, leading to ulceration. If that happens, the doctor will have to operate on my face, and I will have a permanent large scar on my face. I thought about it and felt chilled, because my film career would be over, and it would be too unsightly to have a scar on my face. But in New York, there are no doctors who specialize in this disease. I heard that the head of the dental department at New York University has some experience with this disease, and I want to ask him to diagnose me."</p>
<p>Audience Opinions - Several Shortcomings in "Spring Tide"</p>
<h3>Xin Ru</h3>
<p>(1) Yan Yu Ying uses the trick of dropping her handkerchief to re-enter her cousin's room and take the opportunity to meet him. At that time, she knew that her fiancé was waiting for her outside. She would never have leaned on him so calmly, waiting quietly for his promise. At the very least, she should have shown her hurried and urgent state at the time, such as frowning, wringing her hands, or clinging to her cousin's shoulders and shaking him… etc., to urge him.</p>
<p>(2) Yu Ying went through great hardships to find Guo Hua in Tianjin in the heavy snow. This situation is so serious. How should her disappointment and grief be expressed? But after a fall, she disappeared without a trace and returned silently to her home.</p>
<p>(3) The old servant went to Tianjin to find Guo Hua and happened to find him in a restaurant! Logically speaking, he went to Tianjin at great pains for the sole purpose of finding Guo Hua and bringing him back to Shanghai, but it was lightly glossed over while Guo Hua was drinking wildly, leaving people unclear about how they broke up? And why didn't Guo Hua return to Yu Ying's side?</p>
<p>(4) It is not easy to break into the home of that noble lady, but Guo Hua effortlessly climbed in through a window. This is somewhat unrealistic!</p>
<p>(5) Since Guo Hua shot Mei Li to death, why didn't he escape? Or use the gun to commit suicide (in fact, it would have been a very good ending if he had committed suicide at this time!), but instead called the police station, willing to taste the flavor of jail?</p>
<p>(6) Li Li and others should not speak so rigidly, as if giving a lecture.</p>
<p>"Spring Tide"</p>
<h3>Sha Lei</h3>
<p>(Above omitted) What I am most satisfied with in this film is the success of the domestic "He Ming Tong," with very clear sound. The second is the discovery of a new star, Li Li. It is not easy for her to play the difficult role of a harlot so naturally on her first appearance on the screen. Yuan Congmei also performed very well. Gao Zhanfei seems a bit too stiff. Wang Renmei is a bit over the top, but they are both working very hard. The photography and set design are also good. In short, this film is worth seeing.</p>
<p>Zheng Yingshi served as both screenwriter and director, and his efforts are commendable, but there are some flaws. For example, when Guo Hua writes a letter to Yu Ying in Tianjin, he first writes "Ms. Yu Ying" and then changes it to "Yu Ying, my love." In fact, he should have written "Cousin Yu Ying" first, because there are no cousins in the world who address each other as "Mr." or "Ms." Mei Li kicks her husband Ma Xiang out of the house as soon as she falls in love with Guo Hua, which is also not very humane. It would be better to write him as only knowing how to drink and not caring about other things in Turgenev's original "Spring Tide." Yu Ying finally ran to Tianjin with great difficulty due to the pressure of life, but she refused to wait a little longer at the gate of the Jin Mansion. She returned without seeing Guo Hua. This not only made the trip in vain but also showed that she did not have a great determination in this trip to the north.</p>
<p>In the original "Spring Tide," the whole book is filled with a faint sorrow and is still a profound and moving tragedy. In this film, it has been changed into a serious event of bloodshed, death, and imprisonment, but the tragic element is not as profound as the original "Spring Tide." This is a lot of work for nothing. Chinese films mostly believe that a comedy must have a happy ending, and a tragedy must have a lot of bloodshed and death, which is definitely a misunderstanding or superficiality. (Below omitted)</p>
<p>In terms of actors, apart from Gao Zhanfei, no one can completely satisfy people. For example, Wang Renmei is most suitable for playing a lively and cheerful woman, but she failed in sad scenes, such as when she went to Tianjin to find her cousin in this film and when she was dying, she could not express it profoundly. Li Li's role as a flirtatious harlot is still competent, but there are also many places where she is pretentious. When Qin Hongyun meets Gao in the hotel, she says too much and too profoundly, but her expression is insufficient. Ma Xiang is simply an uninvited guest, because everyone does not know how he came every time he appears. The makeup technique of the doctor is too bad, making people know at a glance that it is fake. We know that Yuan Congmei is very suitable for playing a villainous young man, but he was not successful this time. (Below omitted)</p>
<p>My Review of "Spring Tide"</p>
<h3>Fei</h3>
<p>After watching "Spring Tide," I feel very empty in my heart.</p>
<p>"Spring Tide" is a failure in terms of consciousness, but it cannot be said that it has no considerable success in terms of technique, although it is still not very satisfactory.</p>
<p>The director's superb skills are commendable and can be seen everywhere, such as the revelation of Guo Hua and Yu Ying's fantasies, Yu Ying's search for her handkerchief in the hotel, etc., all of which can bring joy to the audience.</p>
<p>The liveliness and beauty of the set design and photography are rare in domestic films, but unfortunately, many places, such as the fake snow scene, etc., reveal flaws due to occasional negligence, and some places are unclear, which is also a shortcoming.</p>
<p>Silver Sea Anecdotes - A Part of the Props in the Photography Studio</p>
<h3>Zhong Qin</h3>
<p>There are many things in the photography studio that we don't know. These are a few points that a British journalist saw when he went to Hollywood. Of course, these are very small points, but they are also very interesting.</p>
<p>The most striking thing in the photography studio is many mirror boxes of varying lengths. They can be divided into four types: one looks like a top hat and is four feet tall; one has a short tripod that is only a few inches tall; one has a five-foot-long tripod, and another has a base like a car and can be moved freely left, right, forward, and backward. These things have not been seen in England.</p>
<p>In a corner, there is a device. Someone is working, putting in full-body films one by one, and taking out half-body films that have been photographed. In addition, there are film segments without backgrounds, and he is changing them into films with backgrounds such as tables and chairs.</p>
<p>Over there is the part of making slow-motion films. Slow motion is filming extremely fast movements and turning them into slow and clear films. We often see sports films in the United States where even extremely fast balls rotating in the air can be seen very clearly. It turns out that they are made using this method. The opposite of slow-motion films is fast-motion films. That is what we often see.</p>
<p>On the floor of the photography studio, there are lines like the boundaries on a tennis court, and there are also dimensions marked on them. If you look carefully, there are three boundaries: one labeled "Close," one labeled "Medium," and one labeled "Long." It turns out that these are mostly boundaries for shooting close-ups of larger distances, which can shoot part of the actor's face, one is for shooting half-body shots, and the farthest one is for shooting a group of people or many people in a room.</p>
<p>There is also a strange thing, which is many semi-transparent sets hanging, made of thin celluloid. Actors can stand behind the sets and be filmed with a camera. The novelty of this set has not been seen in Europe, but its manufacturing process must be very difficult.</p>
<p>Letters to the Editor</p>
<p>Respected Editor,</p>
<p>I am writing to you with great surprise after reading several short film news items in the "Film Special" section of your newspaper yesterday (29th), such as the news that "Gong Jianong, Xu Xinyuan, and Wang Mengshi are said to be leaving Mingxing." I don't know where this news came from. I believe that our film industry has been invaded by imported films in recent years and affected by the economic downturn. In this precarious time, we should strive to compete artistically in production to save the collapsing situation. How can a few colleagues not follow this path and instead use base publicity and malicious techniques to destroy others? If this continues, our film industry will collapse and perish, even if it is not defeated by external forces. Thinking of this, I cannot help but feel pain. I recall that in the spring of this year, a certain company also had rumors of gathering the Four Great Kings of Hu Die, and they even signed and stamped a letter to a certain newspaper, asserting that Hu Die would be the basic actress of the company starting on March 1st. But for half a year, Hu Die has not only not been hired by the company but has also renewed a long-term contract with our company to continue performing. Moreover, our company's actors Gong Jianong, Wang Xianzai, Xiao Ying, Tan Zhiyuan, Xu Xinyuan, Xie Yunqing, and Wang Mengshi have all renewed their contracts for three years on September 30th of this year. Only Gao LIdou and Huang Junfu have not renewed their contracts. The facts are the best and irrefutable evidence. Empty words only invite ridicule from those in the know. I am writing this letter specifically to request that you correct this in the "Film Special" section. I am anxiously awaiting your response.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Mingxing Film Company</p>

<p>Film Novel - Paddy the Next Best Thing (9)</p>
<h3>Xin Sheng</h3>
<p>That night, there was a grand dance party in Paddy's old house, which was specially held to welcome Paddy. That night, the clock struck twelve, and all the music suddenly stopped. All the guests gathered in front of the stairs at the same time. The clock slowly struck twelve times. Paddy came out at the top of the stairs. She was wearing the clothes that her mother had made by hand. At the same time, the music played the melody of "Welcome Home." Paddy walked down the stairs step by step, and everyone shouted at the same time, "Welcome Paddy home! Welcome Paddy home! Congratulations Paddy on your birthday!"</p>
<p>At the bottom of the stairs, Jack caught Paddy with one hand and held a large roll of paper in the other. He shouted, "Welcome home, Paddy!" Paddy felt a little strange and asked, "Home? Home?" Jack said, "Yes, this is your home, including everything in it, completely the same as before. This is your Christmas present. This is the deed." Paddy stared at Jack and could not speak. Her eyes suddenly saw Lawrence Blake. She understood that this was all his trick. She suddenly turned around and ran upstairs. By the time Jack wanted to stop her, it was too late. Jack had to laugh and say, "You see how good I am at controlling women!"</p>
<p>The music started again, and everyone paired up to dance. The floor was filled with swirling dancers. Lawrence Blake took this opportunity to go upstairs to find Paddy. Paddy was about to enter her old room. Lawrence stopped her. He begged, "Paddy, why are you angry?" Paddy said hatefully, "I know, you bought this house." Lawrence said, "I bought this house for you." Paddy stuffed the roll of deeds into Lawrence's hand. She said, "I can't accept this." Lawrence said, "This deed is in your name. This is your property, yours, always yours... Even after you and I are gone, this house will still be here, and our children will still live here... Now Eileen is married. You have nothing to worry about. As long as you can understand how much I love you, baby..."</p>
<p>"As long as you know how much I loved you in the beginning..." Paddy said without even realizing it.</p>
<p>"Paddy," Lawrence was still a little suspicious. Did Paddy confess her love for him! He took her into his arms; her head was tightly pressed against his chest. Paddy said, "Do you understand? This is what I hate you the most!" (The End)</p>

<h3>Mr. Song's Actions Yesterday to Convene Subordinates</h3>
<p>From eight o'clock yesterday morning, the Administrative Vice Minister Zou Lin, Permanent Vice Minister Li Tiao-sheng, General Affairs Director Deng Mianren, Public Debt Director Zheng Lai, Currency Director Xu Kan, and Advisor Qin Yingchun, along with the Chief of the Consolidated Tax Bureau Xie Qi, and the Director of the Salt Inspectorate Zhu Tingqi, etc., all responded to former Minister Song's summons, and successively went to the Ministry of Finance's Shanghai office on Avenue Road (Xi'ai'xian'si Lu) to discuss transfer matters.</p>
<h3>Mr. Yu Visits Mr. Song</h3>
<p>Shanghai Municipal Council member and Chinese Director of the Municipal Council Yu Qiaqing visited Minister Song at the Ministry of Finance's Shanghai office on Avenue Road at 9:20 yesterday morning to offer his condolences.</p>
<h3>Mr. Song Ziwen's Remarks</h3>
<p>Mr. Song Ziwen received newspaper reporters at the Ministry of Finance's Shanghai office on Avenue Road at 10 o'clock yesterday morning and made the following remarks:</p>
<h3>Long Held Resignation Intentions</h3>
<p>Mr. Song first stated, "Due to various difficulties, I have long held intentions to resign. The reason I was unwilling to announce it earlier was that before the government had decided on a successor, during this transition period, I feared it would affect the market and finance. Today's newspapers report that various groups have telegraphed the central government to retain me, with sincere wording. Besides expressing my gratitude for their kindness, I am deeply glad that I did not announce it earlier. Otherwise, my personal conduct and the financial markets would have been affected."</p>
<h3>Reasons for Leaving Office</h3>
<p>"It was quite difficult to phrase my resignation letter because in our country's old customs, those who resign often cite illness. When officials leave office, nine times out of ten they claim illness, which leaves foreigners with the impression of an 'sick man of East Asia.' I have no illness, and I have been abroad for four or five months, and my health is excellent. If I were to use illness as an excuse, it would not be in line with my usual principle of sincerity. Therefore, I directly acknowledged my lack of talent and ability. Now, the central government has also approved my request to relinquish responsibility based on this letter." At this point, a reporter asked about the reasons for the difficulties and whether they involved the imbalance between diplomacy and finance. Mr. Song replied, "Now that the central government has approved my resignation letter, it seems unnecessary to say anything more. I would prefer not to discuss this."</p>
<h3>Economic Commission Standing Committee</h3>
<p>"Although the National Economic Commission is a funding agency, it does not need to raise funds like the Ministry of Finance. The central government has not approved my resignation from the position of Standing Committee Member. However, whether I will continue to hold this position is something I have not had time to consider recently, as I have been busy with transfer matters, and I cannot give a definite answer at this time. As for financial matters, now that Minister Kong is in charge, if I have any insights or capabilities, I will naturally contribute them to the authorities at any time."</p>
<h3>Staff Advancement and Retreat</h3>
<p>"Apart from the internal assistants in the Ministry of Finance who have already submitted their resignations and will soon retire, the heads of the tax collection agencies are also serving the country. Unless the succeeding minister finds replacements, they cannot lightly speak of leaving due to my personal advancement or retreat. Therefore, before I hand over, I will not approve the resignations of tax collection agency personnel. I believe they are full of responsibility and will prioritize the country."</p>
<h3>No Financial Impediment</h3>
<p>Subsequently, a reporter asked whether the previous week's rumors of the minister's resignation had caused the public debt market to gradually decline, and whether the minister's departure would have a more significant impact on the financial markets. Mr. Song replied, "Now that the successor has been decided, everything can proceed as usual, and the financial markets will definitely not be affected."</p>
<h3>Temporarily Not Leaving Shanghai</h3>
<p>Finally, the reporter asked if Mr. Song would be going elsewhere. Mr. Song replied that he would be in Shanghai to handle the transfer, and did not plan to go elsewhere after that. "Since I am not leaving office due to illness, there is no need to go to another place to recuperate."</p>
<h3>Wang Jingwei Comes to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The New News Agency reports that Executive Yuan President Wang Jingwei originally planned to come to Shanghai the day before yesterday. However, because Chairman Chiang returned to Nanjing to discuss Mr. Song's resignation, he was unable to make the trip. According to sources close to Mr. Wang, Mr. Wang is scheduled to take the night express from Nanjing to Shanghai last night to meet with Mr. Song, arriving in Shanghai at 7:00 this morning. Many speculate that since the central government has already approved Mr. Song's resignation, there is no important official business for Mr. Wang to meet with Mr. Song, and Mr. Wang's visit may be related to himself. However, according to the new Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi yesterday afternoon, Mr. Wang will come to Shanghai tomorrow (i.e., today) to personally persuade Mr. Song to continue serving as a member of the Standing Committee of the Economic Commission, and the rumors of Mr. Wang's negativity are purely speculation.</p>
<p>A Central News Agency dispatch from Nanjing on the 30th states that Premier Wang returned to the No. 1 official residence of the Executive Yuan at 5:30 p.m. on the 30th after the Executive Yuan meeting. Subsequently, Sun Ke visited to discuss Economic Commission affairs. Wang and Sun left for Shanghai by railcar at 11 p.m. on the 30th, accompanied by Chu Minyi, Zeng Zhongming, and Tang Youren. According to Chu, Wang and Sun's mission to Shanghai is to discuss the progress of the Economic Commission with Song and hold a meeting of the Standing Committee in Shanghai to decide on the date of the first plenary session of the Economic Commission. The various economic plans of the current Economic Commission urgently need to be implemented, and it is hoped that Standing Committee member Song will come to Nanjing to preside over the promotion of the commission's affairs. The resignations of the two Vice Ministers of the Ministry of Finance, Zou and Li, have reached the Executive Yuan. The Executive Yuan meeting on the 30th did not discuss them. It is reported that the Executive Yuan will grant a consolation and retain them. However, according to reliable sources, one of Zou and Li is determined to leave, and the successor is still awaiting Kong Xiangxi's consultation with Wang.</p>
<h3>Citizens Should Assist the Bandit Suppression Army Mayor Wu's Report at Yesterday's Memorial Week</h3>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that Mayor Wu reported on the importance of bandit suppression at the Municipal Government Memorial Week yesterday. His original words are as follows: "Fellow comrades, China now has a major internal problem, which is more dangerous than anything else. It is enough to hinder the construction of the new China and the revival of the Chinese nation, and even to restrain our government from resisting foreign aggression and building national defense. When we recall these past few years, our government has been unable to complete various political, economic, and social constructions in accordance with the Premier's will in the active aspect, and in the passive aspect, it has not been able to thoroughly stabilize the localities and enable the common people to live and work in absolute peace and contentment. All of this has been restrained by this internal problem. The extent of its harm can be imagined. This internal problem is bandits. The Communist Party uses bandits to bring disaster to China. The terrain in the bandit areas is complex, and the bandits appear and disappear unpredictably. When they encounter the national army, they break up into smaller units. Once the national army leaves, they regroup into larger units. Since ancient times, bandit suppression has never been easy. The current bandits are even more cunning and difficult to suppress. Moreover, the bandits take advantage of the lack of national unity, making joint suppression difficult and allowing them to linger and spread. Therefore, various construction projects of our government cannot be implemented or completed, and the people cannot live and work in peace and contentment. This kind of restraint has become the biggest internal problem for our country. If this internal problem is not eliminated, it will most likely cause the country to collapse and the nation to perish. How can we see this? It is because this internal problem hinders the construction of our country on one hand and hinders the development of the national economy on the other hand. That will certainly cause our country and nation to weaken day by day. This kind of weakening not only reduces our strength to resist foreign aggression but also tempts others to develop a kind of ambition towards our country, leaving us helpless both internally and externally. Therefore, in the past two years, even when foreign troubles have been extremely urgent, the government has not relaxed the work of bandit suppression and has made the greatest determination to eliminate the bandits no matter what. Internally, it can remove the obstacles to the construction of the Republic of China, and externally, it can also remove the obstacles to resisting foreign aggression. Then, when we encounter foreign troubles, we can concentrate the will and strength of the people of the whole country to resist through a nationwide mobilization. This is something that the people of the whole country should clearly recognize. Secondly, let's talk about the relationship between Shanghai and bandit suppression. Shanghai is an important economic center of the country, and the prosperity of Shanghai depends on the stability of the rural areas in the interior. In other words, if the rural areas in the interior of our country go bankrupt or become unstable, the possibility of Shanghai's prosperity will decrease day by day. If we can work hard in the passive aspect to stabilize the rural areas in the interior and in the active aspect, we can find ways to revive the rural economy in the interior and increase the productivity of farmers, then Shanghai's prosperity will not only be maintained but also gradually increase. And the first step in stabilizing the interior and reviving the rural areas is bandit suppression. Therefore, bandit suppression also indirectly promotes the prosperity of Shanghai. Therefore, Shanghai will hold a movement to assist the bandit suppression army and a bandit suppression propaganda week within this week to support the bandit suppression army and awaken Shanghai citizens to recognize the close relationship between this bandit suppression and Shanghai's future. At the same time, due to Shanghai's special circumstances, reactionary elements take advantage of this point to conduct secret activities. Therefore, it is hoped that Shanghai citizens, for the sake of the interests of the country and the nation, and also for the sake of their own interests, should report and expose these hidden reactionary elements in the city to the local police station to help the government eliminate them. At the same time, they should also provide spiritual and material assistance to the bandit suppression troops at the front, encouraging and urging them to complete the entire task of bandit suppression. This is the enthusiastic and sincere expression that we Shanghai citizens should have at the beginning of this general offensive by the bandit suppression army."</p>
<h3>Bandit Suppression Propaganda Week Party and Government Agencies Jointly Prepare to Hold It Starting on the Sixth of Next Month</h3>
<p>The party and government authorities in the city believe that the bandit suppression war at the front has repeatedly reported good news, and the people in the rear should urgently provide spiritual and material support. Therefore, it has been decided to lead all the citizens to hold a large-scale bandit suppression propaganda movement. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Party and Government Agencies Send Personnel to Prepare</h3>
<p>The city's party and government authorities, in order to have the bandit suppression forces at the front strenuously and cooperatively suppress the bandits and report frequent victories, should have the people in the rear provide spiritual and material assistance to encourage the officers and soldiers on the front lines to bravely extinguish the bandits. Therefore, the Municipal Party Department has specifically sent Huang E, Dong Muge, Fan Mingyao, Zhang Hanyun, Cao Runsen, and other five people, the Education Bureau has sent Wu Baoxi, Yang Zhi, Zhang Shen, Gao Jie, and other five people, and the Social Affairs Bureau has sent Zhou Hanmei, Huang Jingzhai, Mao Zhenchu, Guo Chongjie, Zhang Zhenyuan, and other five people to prepare everything, and the heads of each agency will provide guidance at any time.</p>
<h3>Scheduled to Begin on the Sixth of Next Month</h3>
<p>Regarding the starting date of the large-scale bandit suppression propaganda movement, after deliberation, it is proposed that the bandit suppression propaganda week will begin on the sixth of next month, and it is planned to convene a meeting in the auditorium of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. Various civil organizations and schools must send five to ten representatives to participate at that time, and the staff of party and government agencies must attend uniformly.</p>
<h3>Schools and Organizations Hold Separate Meetings</h3>
<p>On the second day of the propaganda week, all schools will uniformly hold meetings and lectures. Primary schools will also compile temporary bandit suppression teaching materials. On the third day, the Municipal Farmers Association will convene farmers from the city to hold meetings and propaganda. The General Labor Union will convene all labor unions in the city to hold meetings and lectures. On the fourth day, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce will convene trade associations from the city to hold meetings and lectures on the bandit suppression situation.</p>
<h3>Celebrity Broadcasting and Car Parade</h3>
<p>On the fifth day of the propaganda week, it is planned to invite local celebrities to broadcast and give speeches at various radio broadcasting stations. On one side, each district party department will organize bandit suppression lecture teams, send personnel to depart, and give lectures and propaganda on the roads. In order to attract the attention of citizens to the bandit suppression propaganda week, it is specifically designated the sixth day as a parade and propaganda day. Cars will be used to form a car parade and travel to various parts of the city, and a large number of publicity materials, colorful slogans, and leaflets will be pre-printed. The Aviation Association is requested to send aircraft to distribute them over the city, and white cloth banners and large slogans will be hung on various thoroughfares to attract the attention of citizens.</p>
<h3>Naval Autumn Maneuver Review Chen Jiliang Arrives in Shanghai to Hold It</h3>
<p>The Ministry of the Navy's autumn review this year has already organized a review committee and held it in stages. Chairman Chen Jiliang has led the entire committee aboard the Hai Chou warship and departed from Nanjing, first going to Xiamen to review the warships there. It is now known that Mr. Chen and his party have completed their official business in Xiamen and arrived in Shanghai on the original warship at 6:00 yesterday morning. They landed at Wusong and rested briefly at the Coastal Defense Command. From 8:00 a.m., they began to review the warships stationed in Song and convened the staff of the Hydrographic Office for instructions. In the afternoon, they inspected Gaochang Temple for a week and are scheduled to return to Nanjing by ship this morning, along the way inspecting the subordinates in Nantong, Jiangyin, and other places in order. The capital is the final review, scheduled to begin on November 1st, and will be fully completed afterwards.</p>
<h3>National Railways Responsible for Through Transportation Preparations are Complete and Will Be Implemented Tomorrow China Merchants Bureau Negotiates and Signs Contract Yesterday</h3>
<p>Through transportation stations for the Beijing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo, Jinpu, Beijing-Ningbo, Jiaoji, Pinghan, Longhai, Pingsui, Zhengtai, and Daoqing railways have all been decided. Preparations for the national railways to be responsible for through transportation are also complete, and designated freight cars will be used exclusively for through transportation freight. As for the Hunan-Hubei section of the Yuehan Railway, the Railway Administration previously received an order from the Ministry to actively prepare to join domestic passenger and freight through transportation. The bureau has now designated Hankou, Puchi, Yuezhou, Changsha, and other four stations as through transportation stations, which will be implemented starting on November 1st. The bureau will formulate ticket prices and send them to the Through Transportation Department of the Ministry of Railways for distribution to various railways for notification.</p>
<p>After the Ministry of Railways permitted the state-run China Merchants Bureau to handle water-land through transportation, the China Merchants Bureau sent a special envoy to Nanjing the night before last to negotiate and sign a general contract for water-land through transportation with the Ministry of Railways. The general manager of the China Merchants Bureau and the director of the Through Transportation Department of the Ministry of Railways will formally sign the contract. After the signing, the China Merchants Bureau will separately sign detailed rules for handling business with the various railways handling through transportation to carry out through transportation. Through transportation between the Longhai Railway and the China Merchants Bureau is scheduled to be implemented on November 15th, and all through transportation procedures have been completed.</p>
<h3>Relieving British Troops Expected to Arrive Today</h3>
<p>The Great American Evening News reports that the British transport ship Neuralia, carrying the 2nd Battalion of the Worcestershire Regiment to Shanghai for relief, was sheltering from the wind in Hong Kong, and had still not arrived in Shanghai today (the 30th). It is expected to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow (the 31st). The 2nd Battalion of the East Lancashire Regiment is now heading to the racecourse for temporary residence, waiting for the ship to leave Shanghai, so that they can vacate the barracks for the new arrivals to be stationed.</p>
<h3>Sun Tonggang Telegraphed Thanks to Aviation Association Commending Completion of National Flight</h3>
<p>The China Aviation Association recognized Sun Tonggang's national circumnavigation flight as a grand feat and his publicity in various places to expand aviation construction, and telegraphed commendations. Yesterday, the association received Sun's reply telegram from Tianjin. An excerpt is as follows: To the Shanghai China Aviation Association: I received the telegram of recognition with gratitude and a sense of unworthiness. I will certainly continue to work hard to save the country through aviation as instructed. Your association is the leading pioneer of aviation in our country. I sincerely hope that you will actively expand aviation propaganda and build aviation organizations. Tonggang is willing to follow your association and work together. I hereby telegraph my thanks. Sun Tonggang pays respects.</p>
