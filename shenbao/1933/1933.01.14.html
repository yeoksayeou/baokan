<h3>英海軍調停提議失敗</h3>
<p>— 元</p>
<p>昨報載路透社秦皇島電。此間英海軍當局向中日提議。願以英艦爲雙方集議地。以討論可否開初步談判。續電稱此議已被雙方切實打銷。又據該社日内瓦電稱。英人近擬拉攏中日就地解决楡案之謀。業已失敗。可知列强迄今猶未放棄其調解中日之意也。英海軍當局。目擊楡關戰事之日益擴大恐一旦中日戰爭發作。將使世界各國相率牽連而入於戰滑之中。引起所謂第二次世界大戰。而有此拉攏中日就地解决之議。固亦不失爲維持和平之苦心。但我人所引以爲異者。英海軍當局。旣在秦皇島艦上。則此次日軍在楡關之暴行。轟炸城關。屠殺人民。必更較遠在他處者見聞親切。從前日軍在遼吉黑種種蠻橫行爲。縱爲日人片面所蒙。或有所不及知。而此次則日人開釁之眞相。顯在目前。日人以難再事欺騙。我國旣受此鉅大之侵略侮辱。詎能再事隱忍而與之言和。故英海軍當局出任調停。亦可謂多此一舉也</p>
<p>雖然。英海軍當局此舉。實足以代表各列强之心理。自國聨受理中日問題以後。我國外交代表。一再以事實眞相抗爭。國聯調查團李頓。亦已以事實眞相報吿。日本且在國聯大會之際。繼續不斷的進行侵略。絕不稍置國聯於心目之中。國聯之顏面已經削盡。而國聯猶欲以敷衍手段。組織所謂調解委員會。尙希望調解之能獲效果。今日人於十九特委會行將開會之前。復有强佔楡關之舉。强佔楡關之不已。復進而攻奪九門口。窺熱河而圖平津。事實彰彰若此。而國聯仍默無一言。置若不聞不覩。猶從容以俟準期開會。我料國會仍不過向中日雙方調解耳。調解無效。仍俟下次開會以延宕之耳。汪院長在日内瓦發表一文。謂「日本之最後行動。不獨又予中國以必須奮鬭到底。保其疆土。維護其國家存在之證據。且爲對於國聯之又一次挑釁。」事實固如是然而國聯必仍任其挑釁而隱忍之。非至世界戰爭之惡魔。臨至脚下。則和平之幻夢終必不醒。夫國聯之和平幻夢。固始終不醒。持未知同墮在和平幻夢中之國人。亦將同於不醒耶。</p>
<p>昨我外交部致英美法等七國節略。謂「凡因中國軍隊本其正黨權力。以抵抗日本之侵略後發生之任何形勢。在法律與事實上中國政府。均不能負其責任。」言外固有明示各國以中國軍隊將抵抗日本侵略之意。然而言旣出口。必將以事實隨之。以前我國之外交當局。對於日本侵略一舉之任何外交公文從未有稍示强硬將出以抵抗之語。今兹之節略不可謂非作進一步之表示。然而我國人尙惴惴焉懼政府之不能坐言起行。以公文表示之者未必即以事實表示。蓋日人之侵略。已經一再而三四。早應以軍隊實力抵抗。但長期抵抗實力抵抗之說。亦旣屢次宣示於我國。民而迄未聞有若何抵抗之準備今之對外鄭重宣示。必與心口頭宣示於我國民者不同。且英海軍調和談判之提議。旣已顯然拒絕。則今後所以自保其生存。自惟有出於抵抗。而决無他途可走。特我國民救國心殷。希望政府之急起力行。有迫不及待之勢。故不覺其言之切而責之深也。</p>
<p>汪院長發表宣言全文</p>
<h3>國聯迄無有效辦法和平已成泡影交涉至於完全絕望惟有奮力抵抗</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）汪院長在日内瓦發表宣言、中國對於暴日侵略、確定交涉與抵抗並行之方針、所謂交涉與所謂抵抗、雖似相反、實則相成、蓋中國爲國聯會員國之一、有遵守國聯規約確保世界和平之義務、雖遭日本侵略、此志不渝、並深信同爲會員國之各國及簽字於華盛頓條約凱洛格非戰公約之各國、亦必以遵守國聯公約確保世界和平爲重、對於日本之侵略、必能確定有效之辦法而實施之、以期達此項目的、所以中國始終信任國聯、聽候解决、此爲交涉之本旨也、惟在此期内、日本之侵略不已、中國爲領土主權人民生命財產計、斷難坐受其侵略、不能不奮起而爲正當防衛、此爲抵抗之本旨也、交涉與抵抗實爲相須而行、缺一不可、中國自遭暴日侵略以來、一面訴諸國聯、一面申命封疆將吏盡其守土之責、不挑釁亦不屈服、其理由根據實在於此、自九一八以來、國聯對於東北事件所有决議、日本置若岡聞、中國政府及人民一面極憤日本之橫蠻無理、一面對於國聯之優柔不斷、不能不十分繫念、自一二八事件後、全國憤怒更達於極點、十九路軍奮勇抵抗於淞滬、全國風起雲湧以從之、然其遵守國聯規約確保世界和平之志、依然不改、故於一面極力低抗之際、仍一面歡迎國聯調查團之來臨、以期得公道與和平之解决、國聯調查團報吿書發表後、對於日本之無理侵略、滿洲僞組織之傀儡行動、閳發無遺、眞相旣明、公論遂定、中國政府及人民雖對於報吿書所擬辦法、不無意見異同、致憾於辦理雖明、而制裁之力仍薄弱、然亦無不願接受其大體意見而開誠商量、而日本對之則悍然不顧、倒行逆施日以加甚、明知十九委員會將於一月十六日開會、而竟於一月二日聚海陸空軍之力毁山海關、重挑戰釁、此舉不但使中國政府及人民深知日本决無學悟之時、非竭其全力與之爲殊死戰、决無以自拔於危亡、同時並使中國政府及人民對於國聯之能否履行明約確保世界和平、認爲已至於最後之界綫、倘國聯至於此時、尙不能確定有效之辦法而實施之、則中國政府及人民向來所持交涉與抵抗並行之方針、將自覺其不能繼續、質言之、即所謂交涉將至於全然絕望也、抑此不獨關係於中國之危急存亡而已、即國聨自身存亡之價値、亦有繫於是、國聯基於維持世界和平之目的而存在、今若對於中日兩會員國之爭端、不能爲公正之判斷與有效之處置、則原來之目的旣已違反、且此後君有效尤者未知何以制之、是和平之理想已成泡影、而後此戰禍正無窮也、中國向爲愛好和平之民族、日本宣傳中國人民抵制日貨之舉、此係日本之侵略中國使然、日本不求其所以然、而但欲中國政府强制人民爲此消極的愛國之舉動、甚且指此可悲的愛國之舉動爲擾害和平、尤甚者且擴大宣傳、謂中國國民黨之民族主義、爲危害世界和平、殊不知中國國民黨之民族主義、其意義内容具見於總理孫先生民族主義講義中、乃基於博愛平等之理想、勗中國民族須努力擔負文明國民應盡義務、以期享受文明國民應得之權利、以中國之自由平等爲基點、以世界大同爲究竟、正有裨益於世界和平者、何危害之有、惟吾人不能不鄭重聲明者、中國固愛和平、然所愛者爲正義之和平公道之和平、若欲以暴力迫害中國使隕於屈服之深淵、則吾國民族不能不爲正義之和平與公道之和平而不斷的奮鬭也、日本方面之宣傳謂中國無組織、無現代國家所具備之能力、吾人對此等誣　多不能承認、即有一二近似者、吾人並不諱言、且吾人現在正努力以改善之矣、惟吾人尙不能無言者、數十年來中國進步渥滯、其最重要之原因爲何、非日本阻碍之力乎、中國艱難獲得之進步、每爲日本以暴力摧毁之、務使之矢折而後已去歲一二八之役、淞滬一帶中國所組織之文化機關、如大學·如圖書館·經濟機關·如紗廠·如各新興工業·莫不爲日本之飛機炸彈毁壞幾盡、此等建設物旣非軍事設備、而日本飛機之投擲炸彈、顯然目的有所專注、而非無意波及者、日本不欲中國自進於現代國家之完善區域、先之以暴力摧毁、繼之以毒口中傷、其確證如此、抑尙有進者、中國有四千餘年之歷史、爲東洋文化之　幹、其一切風俗與西洋文化不能盡同、中國固努力以期模仿西洋文化之長、然於其固有之文化、不能一槪抛擲、故所謂現代國家之標準、將來或須再行估定、若瀝舉一二爲西洋現化國所有而中國尙闕如者、即以之指證爲中國無現代國家資格、非篤論也姑不具論、以中國有如此悠久歷史、蓋以土地之廣、人民之衆、一旦斷絕於世界和平之維持、出其全心力以與日本爲長期之奮鬭、則中國之犧牲固大、而全世界所受之影響、亦將不堪設想、况殺機一開、又豈限於中日兩國乎、此不能不望主持世界和平之機關及主持世界之輿論代表者注意及之也、（十二日中央社電）</p>

<p>（華盛頓）日駐美大使出淵、十二日訪問史汀生、其會談内容未經發表、然出淵大使於會見後對記者謂、史汀生責問日軍是非欲占領熱河全省、余對之答謂、日軍</p>
<p>攻略熱河成否、繫於張學良及中國軍隊之活動如何、如張學良軍迫近鐵路、日軍即根據條約、（殆指日僞議定書）上之義務、當然負責保護滿洲國及其權益、滿洲國視熱河爲其領域之一部之事、恰如張學良曾把持政權當時視熱河爲滿洲一部之事相同云云、（十三日日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）駐日法國大使馬爾德、本有被調動說、今日竟由巴黎啓程提早返日、據傳法使之趕回原因、係因國聯調解中日紛爭已形絕望、遠東形勢今後愈益嚴重、爲爲整理裑雜之遠東外交問題、不能不提早返任云、（十三日華聯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）泰晤士報今日社論、謂日軍最後目的在奪取熱河、現無疑義、外人目前最注意者、爲戰事應限於一隅、而不可延及中國本部、日人所擬此後以山海關爲中立區域之計畫、未可厚非、但若戰事展至平津附近、則列强殆難始終緘默、屆時或將有以國聯爲中心之共同行動也云云、（十三日路透社電）</p>
<h3>美總統否决菲島獨立法案</h3>
<p>（理由）准許獨立後菲島將孤立無依無力抵抗日本侵略中國移民　　國民社十三日華盛頓電　美總統胡佛否决菲島獨立案、已開具理由、於今日送達國會、胡佛否决要旨、因深信獨立之菲律濱國家、將無力抵抗遠東民族之武力侵犯或和平移民、揣其語意、顯指菲島獨立、恐有日本武力侵犯或中國人民不絕移居入境之虞也、美總統否决咨文、語頗明决、聲稱　案不切合實際、在經濟方面旣不健全、自國際立塲觀察亦有危險、首稱美國購買非島以後、即對本國人民與菲人及全世界、負有三重責任、對於該島之自由、固必按步進行、但此種步驟、應以十五年或二十年後召集公民大會爲根據、嗣於此案之基本道德與經濟利害上、表示疑慮、謂從道德立塲觀察、應竭力反對此案、因吾輩向全世界負有爲菲人造成完全自由之責任、不應再造亂源以便私圖、今此案不能履行此種責任、反有造成亂源之危險、菲人經濟生活、在今後若干年間、仍將依賴對美貿易之優惠特權、倘於此時允許獨立、則該島全部財政制度將起危險、欲袪除此種危機、尙須</p>
<p>在經濟方面作多年之　備、嗣謂此案之</p>
<p>動機、想係救濟某種農業利益起見、殆欲</p>
<p>免除菲島椰子油與美國奶油競爭、菲糖與美國糖業競爭、及菲島蔴繩與較近西方國家產品相競爭之故、便此案未必能獲得所期望之救濟、因從實際言、此項競爭物品、本案所規定免稅數量、　多於一九二八年糖與椰子油之輸入額、嗣又謂此案所　定獨立前十年内之自治地位、將削弱美國在該島之民政權力、屆時美國所有實在權力、僅將限於某種經濟事件、與否决其立法院通過之法案而已、但美國仍負有該島財政事件與地方安善之全部責任、此種局勢、易釀禍患、</p>
<p>最後乃論及鄰邦民族武力侵犯與和平移居之危險、謂菲島一旦獨立、孤立無依、將無力防免此種侵犯與移居、更、目下遠東時局之不安定、不論獨立或在自治地位、益增政治危險支、</p>
<p>胡佛提出主張　美國胡佛總統於否决菲島獨立案之咨文内、除述否决理由外、復提出本人計劃、主張應俟菲島召集公民大會後、准許其獨立、而該會召集之期、當俟諸十五年或二十年後、在此準備時期應先擴張現行内閣制、减少美國　保留之權力、並立即限制菲移民、以保護美國　工、又在召集公民大會前、美菲應訂立協定、仿照古巴前例、商定彼此商務優先權利、但其範圍當比古巴爲廣大、又美國在菲人召集公民大會前、亦應明白聲明是、否將完全撤回在菲海陸軍根據地、是否將取銷所負維持菲島獨立之道德上及其他責任、但在目前此種必要之最後步驟、美國與菲人均不能决定云、（國民十三日華盛頓電）</p>

<h3>日軍進犯熱河之兵力</h3>
<p>（中村談攻熱爲應急方略平津謠甚盛房租驟高漲日僑結束商務婦孺回國）</p>
<p>天津通訊、楡城失守、今已九日、一衣帶水之石河、儼成敵我兩軍之鴻溝、敵在東岸構築持久掩蔽工事、我在西岸佈置堅固防地、敵旣無意西犯、我亦無意反攻、每天雙方步哨相遇、各放幾槍、我若以望遠鏡東窺、則楡城上旭日之旗、淸晣可辨、不知東北軍首先抗日之何旅長對之、作何感想耳、</p>
<p>總台各方面之情報而歸納之、則敵已决心進攻熱河、在熱河未佔領前、爲擾亂我後方起見、充其量攻下　州爲止、或者用飛機到平東各縣鎭擲彈炸而已、平津兩地、可獲短時期之安寗、或者廢曆新年、亦可平安渡過、因爲駐津日軍司令中村孝太郎、已向外報記者表示、中國軍</p>
<p>隊如不在平津一帶向日軍挑釁、相信平津决不致發生戰事、中村對於進攻熱河、已不諱言、彼謂「張學良調遣大兵積極開往熱河、企圖攻佔義縣錦州、切斷日軍聯絡、顚覆滿洲國、我日本爲實行日滿軍事協定起見、對張學良之企圖、不得不加以對策、因此進取熱河、乃爲事勢上所必需之應急方略」云云、又據英美人士所得消息、敵方進攻熱河兵力、現已判明者、計有西義第八師團、及一個騎兵旅團、漢奸程國瑞李際春等兩旅、近又調多門第二師團爲攻熱預備隊、該師所轄之長谷第三旅團·天野第十五旅團、已由哈爾濱瀋陽分批開往錦州溝帮子大虎山一帶、錦州飛機塲停有敵機三十餘架、義縣新、</p>
<p>築之飛機塲停有敵機二十餘架、生日各有三五架飛往開魯凌源朝陽都山一帶偵察、並散放煽惑民心之傳單、楡關錦州近日運到大批軍火、秦皇島原停有敵艦十二般、近祇餘三艘、其餘則運送陸戰隊赴葫蘆島登中岸、熱河邊境、已有數處發生衝突、但非正式接觸、劇戰當在一星期以後、鈴木旅團進攻九門口石門寨、曾與我軍發生衝突、嗣後即無續報、故眞相未明、平津兩地、近來謠言繁興、惟北平以東交民巷爲字樂窝、天津以英法租界爲保險櫃、客有來自故都者言、東交民巷除各使館外、所有房屋、已有人滿之患、某宅藏有唐宋孤本書籍甚多、向東交民巷某宅賃得馬棚一間、月租六百元、一次預繳三個月租金、舉此一例、其他已可想見、天津英法租界房價、刻已驟漲十倍、在旬日前、房租每間七八元者、今則非七八十元不賃、天津之恐怖現象、英法租界房產公司、不能辭一部份現象、英法租界房產餘房可賃、乃又别覓桃源、紛紛逃往太原綏遠、良以一般民衆對於前方情况、均在迷離惝恍之中、敵方更　機製造種種虚僞消息、以惑人心、就天津言、即有三處、一爲日軍部電訊處、二爲日總領事館情報處、三爲電通社、每日編譯英德俄各國文字稿件、贈送各外報、不取　費、每日不下一兩萬字、並歡迎各報赴其宣傳機關訪問、雖在深夜、亦有負責接待之人、再看我省市各政府乃第一軍部、均無一字宣傳、中外記者遇有懷疑莫决之消息、欲思詳究、亦不可得、以致關於前方情况、每天必發生歧異之　傳、</p>
<p>自楡關戰事發生後、人民心理、即發生緊張現象、省主席王學忠當派員向中村交涉、望在此人心不靖時期、日軍不得在中國地演習、中村當即允諾、最近一星期以來、日軍祇在租界内演習、日軍部並於前日密令日僑結束商務、停止進貨、婦孺有願返國或赴大連者、免費遣送、就此一事觀之、天津終必有事變發生也、（一月十一日）</p>

<h3>日代表詞色悻悻</h3>
<p>松岡云、中國代表已保留下次開會時對於所述各節提出意見之　、惟余願請中國代表記取者、即余並不請其對田中奏摺有所辯論、該奏摺之屬僞造、已無須置辯、但中國代表旣有確定之指陳、則自應提出證據、　實其說、深望中國代表在下次開會時、勿忘余之請求也、</p>
<h3>主席請李頓出席</h3>
<p>至此、主席乃請調查團團長李頓爵士出席、主席並云、行政院　會員已熟聆上星期一及今日下午中日代表之演辭、調查團各團員亦已接受行政院之請、列席傾聽雙方意見、余深信行政院諸會員對於調查團各團員於獲聆中日發言之後、是否對於報吿書中所稱各節、有加、修正之意之一點、必甚爲關心、各會員如能同意、則余請提議請調查團各委員召集會議、考慮此項問題、並在便利範圍之内、迅向行政院報吿其意見、諸會員於此是否均能同意乎、</p>
<p>「松岡」、主席提議、吾人並不反對、惟應確切認定者、即任何意見之發表、應爲調查團整個的意見、而不應爲任何單獨團員之意見、又有一點宜注意者、即以吾人見解、調查團於向行政院造具報吿書後、其使命即爲完畢、故依照該團之任務言、其對我國政府、或余所發表之聲明書、或節略加以討論或表示意見、實爲越出該團之權力以外者也、</p>
<p>「主席」、關於日代表所提第一點、當然應爲調查團全體之意見、關於第二點、余意調查團現在依舊存在、直至行政院正式撤消之時爲止、故行政院如願知調查團整個的意見、儘不妨諮詢之也、</p>
<p>「松岡」、余所述者、恐主席尙有所誤解、調查團報吿書一三八頁稱、「吾等工作現已吿竣、」此語吾人完全同意、蓋調查團之工作、已於其完成報吿書之時完竣、是以吾人以爲關於完成報吿書以後之一切事件、該團無權作任何批評、或發表任何意見、此乃吾人之主張、行政院如對此點以爲不然者、則余不得不表示異議、並保留吾人之態度、</p>
<p>「主席」、余之見解、以爲調查團之工作、應俟行政院將其正式解散後始爲完竣、就過去之習例言、任何調查團組織成立後、其團長往往出席行政院會議答問、　俾對其報吿書各點有所解釋、先例固已數見不鮮矣、</p>
<p>「願代表」余僅代表中國政府對主席延請調查團表示意見之提議加以贊同、中日雙方代表、在行政院席上、旣已作甚長之聲明、尤其日本代表對調查團報吿書之事實部份曾加評駁、吾人自應予調查團以表示其意見之機會也、惟余對日本代表今日所陳、尙有意見、待下次會議中發表、是調查之陳述意見、似當俟余發表意見完畢之後也、</p>
<p>「松岡」余對中國代表所表示之情意、完全同情、惟爲避免誤會計、余不能不聲明一點、依吾人見解、調查團完成報吿書後、其工作即爲完竣、此後即不能表示意見或發表批評、吾人行事必循規則、設若余之解釋爲謬、則余自願撤回之、惟余對此點、仍有重大之懷疑也、</p>
<p>「主席」余請爲余之提議加一解釋、余並不主張調查團對其報吿書得有所增補或更改、不過請各團員　會後、討論在渠等獲聆中日雙方意見之後、有無對報吿書中所陳有改變或增加意見之意、並向行政院報吿其事實而已、</p>
<p>「松岡」此即爲吾人所反對者、吾人對此頗多疑義、不能不保留再行研究之權、</p>
<p>「李頓」李頓爵士起言云、余願代表余之同儕、對行政院與吾人以在獲聆中日雙方聲明後、表示有無增改吾人在報吿書中意見之機會、致其謝意、惟余所表示之意見、旣應爲調查團整個之意見、故余在未與余之同儕會集討論前、現在當然不能發表言論、吾人將於明日集會、討論此點、至關於日本代表所提出之點、余敢吿日本代表、調查團各團員回國後、即未集會、亦未以調查團　個名義發表意見或任何行動、至行政院之提議、當並非請調查團對於中日代表所陳加以批評、不過請其表示是否對於報吿書中之意見有所變更否耳、</p>
<p>「主席」除日本代表所提保留外、行政院各會員殆已同意於余之提議乎、（衆無異議）（二十三日辯論完）（未完）</p>

<h3>抵制聲中日貨在華傾銷現狀</h3>
<p>日煤在滬每月銷達九萬餘噸</p>
<p>日本水泥每年銷至百餘萬桶</p>
<p>漁業組公司作大規棧之侵略</p>
<p>新聲社云、市商會以日貨進口激增、盡量傾銷長江流域一帶、每週平均、約有五萬餘件、特再重申會員大會對日經濟絕交議决案、嚴密防止、新聲社記者、昨查得日本在華傾銷貨品、而國貨影響最深者、分誌如下、</p>
<p>日煤　日煤傾銷、以上海漢口兩處爲根據地、其政策爲利用撫順煤、由東北轉運滬漢傾銷、本來撫順煤在漢陽銷售、每噸可得凈價日金六·五○元、即在大連、亦可得價六·二○元、乃運滬漢發售、僅得凈價日金四·○三元、其棄重利而不顧、傾銷存心、便可明瞭、更利用我國資本薄弱商人、以放賬辦法、將煤售與小商店、其計劃甚爲細密、但據開　煤鑛公司調查、開平二號屑、去年僅售十兩零七錢半�</p>
<p>、惟各地存貨、有秦皇島六十餘萬、噸、漢口十三餘萬噸、蕪湖以下十五萬噸、總計百萬噸之鉅、均受日煤傾銷影響、並非國煤運費太昻之故、因開平及開平以外各種煤運費、除山西煤等少數例外、每噸每公哩計算、開平十五元、中興五元、井陘六元、六河溝八十二元、運費甚爲平允、國煤滯銷、其主要原因、仍在日煤傾銷、如去年八月份、日煤在滬、實銷數達四五·八三一噸、又撫順煤達四五·五八二噸、爲數殊足驚人、</p>
<p>水泥　日本水泥傾銷地點、我國沿海各埠、爲上海天津汕頭厦門靑島廣州等處、長江一帶、則以漢口爲中心、傾銷方法、除跌價外、且向用户、各營造廠工部局電車公司等直接兜銷、現在上海售價接貨交貨爲每桶約三兩、比在日本售價祇二錢四分、國貨水泥、在滬售價、每桶四兩六錢、外加統稅佣金等、共計每桶五兩三錢五分、皆貨貴二兩三錢以上、我國國產水泥、每年可產約三百七十餘萬桶、全國各埠銷量、共計二百七十餘萬桶、其餘一百餘萬桶、即爲日本水泥所侵奪、本來國產水泥、原可自給、即就質量而論、雖未必勝過日本水泥、然亦無甚差異、祇以日貨傾銷關係、以致未能暢銷、</p>
<p>漁產　日本侵略我國漁業、自明治二十八年即已開始、而以靑島上海香港等處爲其根據地、民國十八年至二十年、上海有日籍手搔網魚輪三十四艘、每年漁產被侵數値八十萬元以上、自我國政府施行漁輪漁稅以後、日輪更狡計百出、在我領海侵漁以後、輒先將漁獲物運至大連、改由華商輪船運滬、私行漏稅、去年日本水產會社、以三千萬元資本、在營口大連組織漁業公司、作大規模之侵略、去年六月一日、日漁進口、一千二百箱、二日八百箱、十一月二十八日、又進口六百九十七箱、實足驚人、日漁達我國境後、實行傾銷政策、查我國寗波等處所產之魚、每担售價約在十六七元、而日魚則降價十元至十二元出售云、</p>

<p>讀者顧問</p>
<p>大家來「做」</p>
<p>丨木君來信丨</p>
<p>讀一月十日本欄張遠君來信，對於高勉之君所提問題（敎育爲什麽辦不好？種田人何以反沒有飯吃？）之討論，如署天嚼雪梨，連呼爽快！爽快！比之隱約其辭的說什麽「整個社會問題」，迴乎不同·可憐！千千萬萬的被壓迫者，他們但知「吃苦」，比牛馬還要苦」，吃「樹皮草根」苦到死！「莫名其妙」！羣衆就是這樣活着，現狀变是這樣支撑着！然而，支撑得久嗎？眼看就要倒啦！倒啦！張君說；「現在只有握起拳頭立起身來做！」眞的，我們現在該大家起來做這「倒」的七作啦！朋友！大家來「做」！</p>
<h3>我們該向那一方面走</h3>
<p>丨錢醒儂君來信丨</p>
<p>連日讀本欄，我們可以聽到許多從重重壓迫之下迸發書來的痛苦的呼聲，這呼聲，實實在在是大衆的！我們相信，只要他是時代的靑年，對於他目前的社會，將有一個什麽轉變，他不該不知道。不料在十二月三十日本欄裏面，發見張從龍君一函，主張本欄多載關於研究自然科學及開辦實業徵示同志的函件，不應徒然給一般失業者發牢騷，失戀者出風頭，我眞不曉得他是在說夢話，還是醒着的！本來，我們這裏所有的是一股血腥氣，汽車上跳下來的闊少，聽見逃荒者在那裏哀乞，一定是討靨的，張君認爲本欄「乏味」正猶如此！只可惜張君的脚跟並不站得怎樣穩，你看，不久就要栽筋斗啦，彼時，我們再看張君要不要發一點「牢騷」喊幾聲「口號」？在這兒，我們究竟該向那一方面走呢？醒來吧！張君！否則，我們祇有做你跟着舊的沒落，很快地沒落！</p>
<p>記者按；關於張從龍君來信之錯誤，我們已在上次覆函中略予糾正。（見十二月三十日本攔）現在又接錢君來信，雖然並沒有什麽新的見解，但亦頗足供參考，故復錄刋於此。</p>
<h3>眞正的「慈善事業」</h3>
<p>丨飄流生君來函丨</p>
<p>讀十二月二十九日本欄，揭載趙靜蘭女士來信（窮家庭與重負擔）眞使我們發生無窮感喟。</p>
<p>我覺得趙女士這種家庭，是含有十二萬分的危險性。凡是稍有熱血的人們，讀完了她的來信，誰都該表示同情的。</p>
<p>做人，尤其是在我們這種中國社會裏做人，不論個人，或是一個家庭，事前自已若不預先打算，步步留心的話，遇到了四處無吿貸時候，社會上是絕對不會來原諒你，或援助你的。祇要不說你是「自作自受」已算是十二分的萬幸了。</p>
<p>我總以爲人是應該互助的，但，現在是什麽世界？你要得一個眞熱心慈善事業，專門帮助無吿貸者的人，恐怕在一萬人裏頭，也選不出一個來。</p>
<p>我也是個艱難困苦裏出身的人，因此對於有苦難的人們，常肯盡力接濟。可惜我的力量太薄弱，財力亦太缺乏，不然的話，我眞願意若那急人之急的事體，帮帮趙女士的忙，一面，極希望與我抱同種感想的同志們，能夠大家聯合起來，想個善後辦法，接濟他們一下，使得她的家庭，能繼續維持下去，眞是一件功德，况且救人亦是自殺，替國家栽培人才，亦是件愛國的事體啊。最後，我祇好以「天無絕人之路」的一句話，先來安慰趙女士一下。</p>
<p>覆；來信對趙女士家庭之苦痛，表示十二分的同情，並願「急人之急」，以個人之力量，帮她一點忙，且更願大家聯合起來，接濟趙女士一下，如此關懷，備見足下宅心之仁慈，實使我們發生無限之欽敬！不過，有一點應請足下注意，我們對趙女士暫時的援助，是否就能使她永離苦境？即使可以，則現社會中像趙女士一樣的人，正不知有幾千幾萬，丨更有許多人快將餓死丨照足下的救濟辦法，是否能使他們一一脫離苦境？當然，那是不能的。那末，我們很能救得趙女士一人，餘者又將奈何？所以，目前的問題，實在不是「慈善事業」所能解决得來，必須改變一個樣子，始能人人得救，這是鐵一般的事實！就是足下所說的「互助」，也必然須在某種條件之下始有意義，在目前這種畸形組織之下是萬萬說不到的。但請足下不要誤會，我們這樣說，並不是阻止人家去做「慈善事業」，我們是更希望大家能夠去做一種能使人人得救的更廣更大的「慈善事業」，亦惟有這種能使人人得救的「慈善事實」，才是「眞正」的「慈善事業」。這是我們所應該吿訴足下的。</p>
<p>孫如昌君鑒；尊見極是，但未便發表。乞示通訊地址，以便函談，不勝盻切！</p>

<h3>錫蘭蹈火典禮</h3>
<p>— 瞻盧</p>
<p>丨世界異俗歌謠之一丨</p>
<p>「探湯蹈火」自古說，此是寓言非事實；不意兩洋錫蘭　，其人乃有蹈火術·每歲節屆愛蕯拉，丨「註一」時爲七月十七日；盛大典禮去蹈火環而觀者人密密·廟前特　一廣塲，乾柴曼成橋梁式；柏油桐油澆復澆，意在增加烯燒力·有一個侶司其事，何時燒起何時訖？燒自午正訖西初，時哉時哉弗可失！敎長乍下舉火令，　時烘烘與烈烈；敎徒燒火拜且歌，衣冠詭異不一式·裸臂共作天魔舞，梵　同唱波羅蜜；跣足往來無定踪，有時徐行有時疾·跳舞旣終蹈火始，自發卙願非强迫；或因會觸神聖怒，或因私德有過失；一朝思欲贖前辜，惟有蹈火可灡雪·敎長未下蹈火令，先向敎長埀手立；授以敎儀與咒語，復令沐浴表淸潔·敎長旣下蹈火令，赤脚不怕炎威逼；牽裳涉足熾炭上，舉步安詳守戒律·維時落日正銜山，晚霞朶朶天半赤；晚霞爭及熾炭紅？數丈以外人辟易；獨有一般蹈火人。是何意態雄且傑？蹈火而無火灼痕，認爲光榮之唯一；不然烈炭傷肌膚，卽知神怒猶未洩；行行且抵斯罡大，丨「註二」蹈火之禮乃吿畢；競向神前作膜拜，梵曲高唱行雲遏，精神堅决一至斯！吾聞其事頗太息！方今國難正臨頭，吾儕何敢自　逸？人人抱有蹈火心，或者可弭此浩刼；否則恒舞與酣歌，坐看河山易顏色，一旦燎原奈若何？吾佛惟云：「不可說·」</p>
<p>註一　愛蕯拉就是敬神的意思，愛蕯拉節就是敬神節·</p>
<p>註二　斯罡大是錫蘭崇拜的神·</p>
<h3>雪</h3>
<p>— 火雪明</p>
<p>丨詩人與狗丨</p>
<p>打了一天暖雨，黃昏時候霽了，繼着是帶有芒角的冷風。滿天是黃雲，快要下雪的樣子，後來終於白盡了大地。</p>
<p>相傳狗歡喜雪，爲的可以看見它自已的梅花足趾。然而我以爲詩人比狗更愛好雪；因爲冰天煑酒，白戰敲詩，是千古高人所承認而且尊重的韵事。</p>
<p>白居易的「晚來天欲雪，能飲一盃無？」寫出遲雪的情調。王維的「隔牗風驚竹，開門雪滿山；灑空深巷靜，積素廣庭間·」寫出下雪時候觀賞的情調。至於岺參的天山雪歌和白雪歌，那樣雄壯偉大的詩境，正不亞於李白的「天兵照雪下玉關」「燕山雪花大如席」等句，同是寫出北國的雪中門爭的情調。現在，島夷集中楡關流血的紅影裏，飄忽着曼天凍雪，我們的抗日英雄，正是「將軍狐裘臥不暖」的時節呀！然而我們的詩人呢？</p>
<p>雪和詩人的關係，蜜糖似的是那樣聯銷着。范成大說：「不是雪中須送炭，聊裝風景要詩來。」便說盡了這個謎。</p>
<p>也许爲了雪花的潔凈，象徵着士大夫的高風亮節，也許雪在嚴冬才下，以爲伊有着傲骨的氣質，所以特别愛好，也未可知。中國詩人是一向贊美着人生要有傲骨的。</p>
<p>至於狗爲什麽對雪天更加興奮，我以爲它們狠命在雪地上奔跑，除了爲取暖的這個解釋外，我不能再知道。在北海的堅冰上靑年男女的溜冰，又是什麽意義，同樣我也不能知道。</p>
<p>這裏，讓我抄一首宋代張打油先生的關於狗與雪詩，結束這篇短文。詩道：</p>
<p>「宇宙一儱侗，古井黑窟籠，黃狗身上白，白狗身上腫。」這首詩，劉大白先生說：「這樣的描寫手段，實在可佩可驚；恐怕諸大家的詠雪詩，都做不到這樣吧！</p>
<h3>花的象徵</h3>
<p>— 人英</p>
<p>丨鮮血和自由丨</p>
<p>花架上添上了兩盆不知名的花，點綴在幽長的走廊。昨天，當我拖着疲倦的身體經過。在花架的面前，我發見了。頎長的花瓣，像血樣的殷紅，週遭襯託着細嫩的綠葉；我站在花架的面前沉默着。</p>
<p>殷紅的花瓣，不是象徵着奔放的鮮血嗎？嫩綠的枝葉，不是象徵着解放和自由嗎？江南趴是籠罩着明媚的春光，遼遠的北國，在那冰和雪的途中，彳亍的起伏着民族的健兒。更有那遼闊的寒空中，白雪深處；飛翔着敵人的鐵鳥。飛濺的泥土，模糊的血跡，他們是犧牲了小我；爲整個的民族奮鬥着！黑龍江中𣺓起了烈士的血潮，長白山頭堆滿了英�</p>
<p>雄的屍骸。忍着飢寒，捨了身家，他們所期望着的，也不是像綠葉般的自由嗎？</p>
<p>要爭取民族的自由，不得不泛起健兒的血花。流流流，流盡了中華民族奔放的熱血。望望望，望到了綠葉浴在春光。</p>
<p>到那時健兒的血跡，得到了代價。在那不遠的明日，鮮血樣的花瓣旁；襯託着自由的綀綠。造成吧，在那時代的前面；留下了歷史的芬芳。</p>
<h3>找尋公理</h3>
<p>— 子泰</p>
<p>丨給戰爭之神找到了丨</p>
<p>天國中消失了公理，諸神都大大的起了恐慌；因爲他們的國是全靠公理維繫着的，沒有了公理，他們的國就要崩潰了。</p>
<p>因此，天國中諸神召開了一個緊急大會，討論去找尋公理的事。會塲中有和平之神先站立起來發言，說他願意盡他的力，去找尋公理來維護這天國。後來是有戰爭之神繼起發言，也如和平之神說的要去找回公理來。被消失了公理而嚇壤的諸神，聽說這二位大神肯効力，立刻答應他們，並限他們三日内答覆。　　三日後，和平之神先來答覆了。他說他不能找到公理。因爲他每到一個地方去問他們有沒有藏着公理，或是公理有沒有躱在他們那裏，都被他們惡狠狠的拒絕了。現在，沒有法子，他祇有空手回到了這裏。他求了諸神的饒恕。</p>
<p>戰爭之神呢？不一息也來回答了。他說他已找到了公理。因爲他每到了一個地方，終用他所有的武力去搜索找尋，不管他們是如何的拒絕；终於在一個地方，被他找到消失的公理。他當說的時候，又顯示給諸神看他那找來的公理。</p>
<p>天國因此復安了。諸神們都釋了恐懼。</p>
<p>由此，他們纔知道：祇有戰爭纔能找回公理；也祇有戰爭，纔能宣示公理給人看。</p>
<h3>漁翁</h3>
<p>— 黃楊木刻</p>
<p>小說</p>
<h3>疚心</h3>
<p>— 了紅瘦鵑</p>
<p>於是他又迷惘地想：萬一今夜越不過這風雪的長途，便怎麽樣？到了目的地，萬一喊不醒室中人的濃睡，又怎麽樣？喊雖喊醒了，萬一他們不願冒寒起來門，又怎麽樣？果眞如此，自已是否還有這勇氣，再冒十餘里路的風雪而趕回家去？即使有趕回家的可能，又是否有這勇氣，再去看後母那種冰雪般嚴冷的面目？如果沒有這種勇氣，另外投奔别的親友，這麽冷的天；這麽深的夜，是否能不取人家的厭憎？即使人家能不厭憎，又是否能夠得到這種眞摰熱誠的待遇？······他惘惘地想着，不禁喃喃地說：『哦，哦，恐怕未必吧！哦，哦，一定不會吧！』</p>
<p>神志剛有點恢復，思想便多於春風底下的野草，該想的也想，不該想的也想，思潮奔驣澎湃，推不去；撇不開，結果，他只覺周身無量數的細胞和血液中，完全充滿了不能描畫的感激情緒。他滿想找出一套感激零涕的話來，對他好友略表一點謝意，然而滿腦窮搜，竟連綴不成半名適當的語句，終於連個最普通的一個『謝』字，也似無力出口。他僅僅舉起有光無神的眸子，熱烈的望了他們幾眼、兩眼眶中，滿蘊着淚液，欲滴未滴。</p>
<p>東方生是他以前的同學，現在還祇二十多歲，是一個胸襟闊大而傾向自然的靑年。他的狀態非常英偉，在英偉中；又帶着一團慈祥愷悌之色。他本是一位模範的耶敎徒，大有上帝那種博愛的心腸，而另一方面，行事的柔和，又像是信仰佛敎的人，凡此種種，都足和他慈祥的外貎相符，並不像世上一部分人，外良善而内齷齼。</p>
<p>東方生的夫人，丨小曼丨和東方生的年齡，雖祇相差三五歲，但是伊的狀貎；神情；舉動；言語，完全還像一個埀髫的小女郎。處處帶着幾分天眞，在不期然而然中，時時流露。伊坐在伊的丈夫身旁，宛如一頭活潑依人的小鳥。伊因爲剛從被窠中起來，秀髮蓬鬆，睡態未消，兩　受了爐火的烘射，微微泛作海棠花蕾般的嫣紅。伊的神情，含慈祥於活潑，這是伊和伊丈夫的相同之點。尤其伊那略帶惺忪而澄澈如秋水的眼珠，每當盼睞到自已臉上時，伊的眼角中，似乎會放射一種溫綩可親的聲音，彷彿在說：『唉！可憐的人，可憐的孩子，你爲什麽竟弄到如此狼狽？』（五）</p>

<h3>一九三三年前途的豫言</h3>
<p>— 特</p>
<p>鼎鼎大名的法國豫言家佛萊　夫人，伊在前年十二月豫料胡佛總統選舉失敗，白星安　終，郵船喬治莽立巴號炎燒，杜美爾遇害，都在去年一一實現。現在舊年已過，新年又臨，伊推算來年的前途黯淡無光。伊說：</p>
<p>我們在一九三三年中，仍不能脫離經濟困厄。歐美將有許多財政崩潰。本年最初數月内，美法邦交將見緊張，但以後可漸漸進步。英國的年運頗壞，英鎊所受的危害，幾乎將歷全年。印度和其他二百治地將起重大之事變。法國有一政治家將遭暗殺之險。法國有一新人物起握政權，他出來後，商業開始轉機。他的功績很多，但多出以外交手叚。德國備戰甚爲活動，法國有被攻之虞，但攻擊之舉並未實現。東方正在多事之秋。</p>
<p>一九三三年最初數月内，將有大風雨，並天空和海上的災禍。科學大有進步，藥物有非常的發明。德國有一偉人領袖消滅於政界。法國有政治家二人，文學家二人，將辭塵世。</p>
<p>西班牙政策有兩次切實左傾。法意邦交底比年初更見親善。俄國布爾希維克主義將受重大打擊，其政體爲之搖動，經過戰鬥後，伊的政策將轉向更和平的布爾希維克主義。</p>
<p>意大利流年很好，發展更見燦爛。拉丁美利堅仍擾攘不靖，阿眞廷財政可望穩固，但國内將發生政治革命。各國女子更露頭角。資本多將變換主人，中等階級人民處處受苦，因此發生種種事故，但法國和北美都無革命。</p>
<p>此次美國選舉總統羅斯福打倒胡佛後，佛萊　夫人曾接美國來函數百通，賀伊一九三二年的豫言完全準確。</p>
<p>··················</p>
<p>又叙利亞人穆罕默德歇克，住在埈及京城開羅，以觀星聞名。他豫料一九三三年法意兩國間將有戰事，英國助法，但將遭遇不幸。巴爾幹將因此大受影響。墨西哥變亂更多，終將爲美國併呑。中日兩國仍不正式開戰，但仍將散戰，結果訂成一種協定，其他如伊拉克，葉門，巴力斯坦等處，皆略有戰事。總之，前途狀况，甚爲艱苦，並有許多災禍云。</p>
<p>按這兩位豫言家關於法意邦交的話，完全相反，正不知那位靈騐，且待年終時再定罷。</p>
<h3>人情測騐</h3>
<p>— 亦菴</p>
<p>法國馬賽有里昂伯辣者，欲測騐友輩對於自已的態度如何，突發訃聞，自已則裝死而僵臥棺中。羣友畢集吊喪之際，以爲蓋棺定論，紛紛評論死者之生平。里昂伯辣旣畢聆其說，卽徐徐自棺中起，向羣友稱謝。中有一人大駭立死。死者之妻遂控里昂辣於法。</p>
<h3>死老虎之代價</h3>
<p>— 亦菴</p>
<p>印度遙遨地方多虎患，一九三一年之中死於虎者有八十五人此地居民之較爲幸運者厥爲置備有標槍或火銃之階級，蓋彼等旣有此利器，卽可獵而致之也。彼等每獲一虎，先得政府之奬金，數目由十鎊至二十五鎊不等。虎肉則售之我華人，蓋我南方之華人多嗜虎肉，以爲能長精力，壯筋骨。脂肪則售諸印度人入藥以爲治風濕之用，銷骨及虎爪可作飾品，獲價頗高。虎肝則售諸戰士，謂食之可壯膽。若爲牝虎，則其乳汗又謂可以治目疾。至於虎皮則售與返國之歐洲人。統計一虎所値，可以使獵者一生溫飽矣。</p>

<h3>掉期迫近金市冷化</h3>
<p>一般同業態度觀望</p>
<p>中央銀行開現續殷</p>
<p>（升降範圍　常狹隘）標金因掉期已近、各號咸無整數進出、故昨市極爲冷淡、初以紐約銀價縮一二五、遠期銀價跌二厘餘、銀行私電小一八七五、雖不見多、然人心却穩、倫敦大條雖長亦不在意、加之條　似涸、稍有買户、卽見漲起、晨開卽漲爲八百零三兩九錢、銀行開盤亦因之而較緊、兩相呼應、加之中央銀行順開現貨、乃見零五兩、旋因匯市趨硬、塲内缺乏對手、賣者雖少、尙有三兩餘跌風、入後仍平、在零三兩内外徘徊、後市更見平穩、中央銀行仍來開現、曾好至零五兩六錢、孟買先電漲起一安那、然價未小、蓋此際交易極少、而恒興傾進、後電跌一安那、而價反降同業成抱觀望、乃因掉期已在目前、過程平和、最後在三四兩間、祇數錢上落、延至收市爲八百零四兩一錢、全市極少變化、中央銀行開現續殷、但來勢稍戢、今將昨日前後市景况分記如次、</p>
<h3>晨市破徘徊面</h3>
<p>晨開人心甚佳、故卽跳爲八百零三兩九錢、物品稍抵爲零三兩五錢、散户均購、價遂好至零四兩外、福餘大德成雖出、但屬少數、檯面上如德康鴻康永等力可支持、故漸漸加至零五兩、盤旋甚久、蓋此時三井吃三月份美金一二五也、但此後銀行肯出、金價亦見下游、源茂永日昌售條、乃退至零三兩光景、花旗雖扒四月份美金一八七五、但售出三月份零六二五、中孚亦出同月同價、福餘源茂永等仍售、乃降至二兩内、爲一兩八錢、恒興限價要進、大德成亦購、俓遂漲至三兩光景、匯豐掛牌英匯不更、美金跌一二五、無關痛癢、天豐永元亨等來出、退爲零二兩、恒餘進到二兩半外、中央銀行開現四百念條之訊傳來、人心一振、三月份美金一二五不易結、塲内恒興來進、好起一兩、檯面上交易不多、匯市亦平、四月份美金一二五可結、一八七五可售、金價亦平、祇在三兩外有幾錢上落、及至念八元正月份美金銀行俱要、乃見零四兩、無如此際全由諸　户進出、稍住片刻、卽見脫手、小去一兩、恒興稍納、未致再降、中央銀行又來開現、萬興代同豐恒來進、升至零四兩二錢、然萬興本號忽出、兆豐昌亦售、立卽回至三兩、大德成在三兩二錢時稍進好起數錢、爲零三兩六錢、華比塞正月份美金九三七五、而爲二兩二錢、恒興大德成稍進、而元春恒餘則出、交易俱少、乃在三兩内互有起仆、最後由福餘來進、漲爲零三兩七錢、物品則出、小落幾錢、遂以零三兩六錢收盤</p>
<h3>後市靜止好二兩八</h3>
<p>午後開盤八百零三兩五錢、交易更淸、而市况越平、源茂　來進條、漲至零四兩外、花旗吃正月份美金九三七五、恒興亦購、升爲四兩五錢、此際略有數錢升降、乃物品從中取利也、旋爲三兩九錢、此後恒興　來購買、小數賣户觀望、而爲五兩光景、此際恒興曾代中央開現、故鴻興大德成大興永亦均望風來進、漸加至零五兩六錢、孟買電吿漲一安那、價雖略小數錢、蓋恒興此時買氣正盛、人後丙興源茂永屢來脱售、恒興亦不時來進、價在五兩光景不時盤旋、及至孟買電吿跌下一二安那、由恒餘略進、升至五兩、華比出五月美金一二五、大德成售條、物品亦從旁附和之、跌爲三兩九錢、人後平靜無事、陷入休業狀態中、祇有呌價而無成價、延至收船爲八百零四兩一錢、物品仍撳　零三兩八錢、查一日間最高價八百零五兩六錢、最低八百零一兩八錢、祇有三兩八錢上落、結果較前收漲　兩八錢、</p>
<h3>揭價多一兩有强</h3>
<p>揭價因美匯掛牌縮一二五、計念七元六二五、　標金價爲八百六十八兩七錢八分、照收盤價言、</p>
<p>約撳六十四兩餘、較前收多撳一兩强、正月份登賬與二月份同爲八百零四兩、補水八百零一兩</p>
<h3>中央又開現七百條</h3>
<p>中央銀行前市約開現六百三十條、由恒興同豐恒大德成盈豐恒等經售、價自零二兩至零一兩半、後市又開七十條、價零五兩、由恒興代做、</p>
<h3>檯面交易零零碎</h3>
<p>檯面上交易淸淡、觀望居多、計恒興恒餘義豐永同豐恒慶　永等軋進、天豐永内興源茂永兆豐昌大興永福太亨源新永日昌等約出多於進、大德成先出後進、大連帮順利略售、萬興前市略出、後市軋進、餘條、廣帮益豐無甚進出、恒興約軋進四百餘條、此外俱　零星、而缺大量進出焉、</p>
<h3>赤市况沉寂之至</h3>
<p>昨仍計照加九兩、成交極少、塲内僅由盈豐恒略出、大豐恒則進、祇七條成交、各現貨號俱無興趣進出、成做之價、略形撳小、蓋掉期已迫、略有關　、</p>
<h3>未來掉期多方略錢</h3>
<p>此屆掉期、雖未做過、但塲内同業空氣大致仍由多方貼進、惟多頭謂可貼進三四兩、普通目光看來、約在二兩左右、中央銀行雖續進現貨、但此次現貨充斥、似乎不致於敲價、照現貨及迨　價　求、此交掉期貼價不至過大、掉期雖在下週一、但明日適逢星期、同業向例須早一日　做、故實在情形、今日或可分曉、固行中欠中央銀行大約祇四千餘條、多方稍占優勢、</p>
<h3>英美兩匯後市稍緊</h3>
<p>銀行與金　進出絕少···上落亦微</p>
<p>昨據外電、倫敦大條微升零六二五、匯兌上落俱小、美銀則跌一二五、遠期銀市亦降一厘餘、銀行私電因而縮一八七五、晨開人心極佳、故近期英匯開盤反較前收微緊、計一先令七便士九三七五、美匯因銀價跌勢未見充足、矿雖緊而不多、計正月份念七元八七五、金市雖漲而　市則依然、故及金價下降而放鬆零六二五、蓋匯豐掛牌英未動而美祇小一二五、未能滿意、加之交易不見屬跷、市况亦因之而呆滯、上午始終在零六二五光景、互相進退、後市稍緊、成交　金市同趨靜默、匯豐稍塞、東洋行家則扒、此外忽進忽出毫無成見、金業中晨市扒结、以後少聞動靜、一日間約有一二五回顧、結果曲匯緊零六二五、美匯亦較前收　起零六二五、今將一日中英美兩匯進出、誌之於左、</p>
<p>（英匯）晨開較前收緊零六二五、爲一先令七便士九三七五、上午祇由匯豐出正月份一先令八便士、蓋進胃缺乏也、延至收市出價正月份一先令七便士十九三七五、二月份八便士、三月份與四月份同爲零六二五、後市仍少交易、上海扒二月份一先令八便士、乃三井听出、匯豐仍出五六月計零六二五、中法所納、收盤正月出價一先令七便士九三七五、二月份同價、進價一先令八便士、三月份一先令八便士、四月份同價、進價零六二五、</p>
<p>（美匯）亦略緊零六二五、計近期開盤出價念七元八七五、二井進三月份一二五、花旗進四月一八七五、盤根二井對做四月份二五、花旗出二月份零六二五、中孚亦售同月同價、和豐賣予中孚三月份一二五、美豐塞華比扒正月份念八元、華比進現貨亦念八元、正金納華比出正月份九三七五、午收價正月份念七元九三七五、二月份念八元、二月份零六二五、四月份一二五、下午交易淸淡、先由花旗售予中孚正月九三七五、盤根亦塞、三月零六二五、花旗又出二月份九三七五、爲安達所納、東方吃進五月份一二五、乃華比所售收盤出價正月份念七元八七五、二月份九三七五、三月份念八元、四月份零六二五、進價自九三七五至八元一二五、美金一圓、因掛牌縮一二五、改爲合銀三兩六錢一分九厘九、</p>
<h3>大條回縮零六二五</h3>
<p>國民社十三日倫敦電、大條小降、收盤近期十六便士八七五、遠期十六便士九三七五、比上日各短十六分之一、又英美匯價開三元三角四分二五、</p>
<h3>英法美日四國之存金</h3>
<p>一月十二日止</p>
<p>裁至一月十二日止、英美法日四國之存金、計英格蘭銀行存金一萬二千零五十萬鎊、法蘭西銀行（十一日）存金八百二十七億六千萬法郎、美國聯邦準備銀行存金四十五億四千九百萬元、日本銀行存金四萬二千五百零六萬八千元、</p>

<p>「洋厘」早市厘價依然如舊、爲七錢一分三厘七毫半、午市忽然跌落六毫二忽半、爲七錢一分三厘一毫二忽半、銀行無買胃之故、「銀拆」早午兩市仍開二分頭襯充斥、無人問津、是以劃頭加水、始終無價、開白劃、</p>
<h3>角洋遞昂銅元大縮</h3>
<p>江南小洋早市爲六錢三分三厘半、午市爲六錢三分五厘、結果較前日改昂　厘、交易早市一萬一千五百角、午市一萬二千角、廣東小洋早市爲六錢二分二厘半、較前日又好一毫二忽半、午市　下三七五、爲六錢二分二厘一毫二忽半、交易早市十三萬五千角、午市十一萬角、銅元暴縮七千文、爲三百七十八千文、本星期中共縮十千文、交易三萬二千一百二十　、計銀欵代價八千五百兩、</p>
<h3>欵收解極見浩緊</h3>
<p>昨銀欵收解、按　需要方面而論、實無瑣忙可能、祇以了結手續甚多、故甚浩緊、　商收解票欵三百二十餘萬、外商收解票欵二百三四十萬、結欵收解仍有二百餘萬、墊欵一百二十餘萬、押欵交易一百餘萬、特欵收解三百餘萬、各種貨匯稅　諸欵收解八百八九十萬、出倉九十萬、錢莊　公單收解二千九百餘萬、劃頭欵收解四百十餘萬、結束欵一百餘萬、各路匯欵收解八十餘萬、收現五十餘萬、</p>
<h3>洋平淡用尤</h3>
<p>市塲中交易、洋欵依然希疏不勁、匯劃票欵早市做出六十九萬五千、午市做出七十五萬、鈔票早市六萬五千、午市五萬五千、塲外鈔票早市八萬五千、午市七萬五千、支單交易早市八萬、午市九萬、　行買賣早市互市五十五萬、午市互市八十萬、各行洋户　來收解一百九十餘萬、洋劃頭欵收解一百七十餘萬、鈔票收回及發出一百五六十萬、抵借洋欵進出一百五十餘萬、洋押欵交易七十餘萬、去胃二十萬、來源四十餘萬、錢莊洋公單收解一千零五十餘萬、小錢莊交易七十餘萬、</p>

<h3>大雪中河下米到頭寥落</h3>
<p>丨丨斛價又漲一二三四角不等丨丨</p>
<p>（滬南）昨因風雪不止、來源更見缺乏、僅到五六號、浦中售剩之貨、見機　緊、故售價混亂、竟加起三四角不等、均屬城鄕店胃、惟昨市售盤、未能稱爲正式、據云在閔行一帶被風所阻、米船爲數不少、倘風雪一止、均可絡繹來滬、想彼時或可　平一些、句胃一因天津行情回跌、二以薄稻乏貨、故未開盤、祇成交廠薄稻數百石、價照原盤、　洋尖及　元均屬應時　俏、惟無大胃耳、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日來船三十二三號、白粳零銷續化、市形又緊尺外、薄稻來源略有、去路尙可、價亦挻立、早稻到少銷活、杜尖高貨乏到、中次稍有、價帶緊象、羊埠尖到貨無幾、銷胃不惡、價加尺外、客尖亦緊近尺、白元到貨不多、零胃俏利、價又加二三角、</p>
<h3>客元缺貨價高半元</h3>
<p>昨日客元客秈到頭均乏、市面本在看好中、又以河下到米不多、南北帮胃口甚暢、昨以雪阻、到源更少、河下元米價漲而乏貨、故本街囤户注重客元、奈客元邇日以存到　少、本有步砌之必要、一經囤户與本街及客帮爭辦、價及突漲半元、始由囤户及本市零户辦去湖南　元六百六十九包、價大至十元零三四角、蕪湖機元五在八十六包、價大至十元零三角至　角半、中次九元八角九分至七角半、南北客胃均活、　米價漲後、乃注意於客秈、計北帮辦去湖南機油五百包、價九元零五分至九元、南路泉州辦去江西機晚五百五十包、價至九元零三分均比前日步砌二五分、銷活到少、後市仍在望好、</p>
<h3>粉市客帮出籠</h3>
<p>丨聞達八九十萬包丨</p>
<p>昨日粉市、上下午開盤後、各月份市面、一致呈波落之象、以洋麥報價、續小二三角左右、因上午開價時、人心卽不見佳、較前日收價、落一分餘、因目下實銷帮之辦胃、雖見緊迫、惟一方採辦現貨、一方卽了結期貨、三四日中、客帮回出之期貨、即達八九十萬包之巨、新户多頭則甚有限、儼心思之多頭、究不能引起人心耳、下午各盤、人心又續見軟弱、因澳麥又來活動、初定開三兩七錢、後新洋行究攬生意、廉至二兩六錢六八半、廠家行家、計放交三船、大致均三月份貨裝、人心之續疲、卽係此故也、收盤結果、本月份較前日跌一分七厘半、二月份跌二分、三日份跌二分二厘半、四月份跌一分二厘半、五月份跌七厘半、六月份跌　分云、</p>
<h3>黃荳祇内地廠家辦去</h3>

<p>（安東存絲積極　滬）　東北風雲日緊、安東及烟台等埠之存絲、現均積極　滬、昨日定生等輪又有八繭灰經一百八十四件來滬、</p>
<p>（人造絲銷總呈淸平）　昨日本埠人造絲市、因烟津帮停辦、浙魯等帮亦以結賬期屆、進胃閒散、祇本埠絲織廠進中　星　現貨人造絲三十二箱價尙平定、</p>
<p>（紐約生絲銷費較滅）　上月（卽十二月）份糧約生絲銷費不暢、昨日本埠美絲商洋行接得美國絲、公會電報、十二月份紐約金市各絲織廠銷費生絲額共約四萬○五百四十八包、其中日絲占三萬七千包弱、華絲祇二千九百五十二包、餘爲意大利及法國生絲云、</p>
<h3>珍眉珠茶法銷活動</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊茶市、路莊土莊兩路之珍眉珠茶、英莊怡和洋行、又復大舉搜辦、綠現下摩洛哥市塲、春銷已吿活動、而滬埠茶價、又均低廉已極故交易頗旺、全市成交竟達一千二百餘箱、大部份多屬婺源　路珍眉、至北路最高　貨、因非洲來價緊縮、華商態度堅定有仍無大宗交易云、</p>
<p>南北貨</p>
<h3>金針菜號盤日緊</h3>
<p>金針菜近以號家一致緊守、趨勢日緊現市如上中莊貨號盤均需十四兩外、方肯卸兌、故行方連日皆有做進、惟銷方去胃雖有、咸欲便宜購入、各行爲　酬起見、僅有零星成交、據業中人之觀察、來春或有十六兩之希望云、</p>
<p>五金</p>
<h3>新鐵絲靜極思動</h3>
<p>新鐵絲交易冷落已久、因此同業均抱有無人講辦之愛、行情晨廉價如十六號至二十號每擔祇估十二兩七錢半、二十一號二三一十五號估十三兩二錢市塲買賣除零星抽花作有採辦外、大家生意堪云毫無、近數日來其　　　有靜　　動　　、如溫州·四川·漢口各帮均有問　、而顧　帮亦有談判、因是人心堅而市盤　、　準喝高數咸、查昨開出一百四五十擔、其價十六號　二十號籌擔十三兩五錢、二十一號至二十五號每擔爲十四兩云、</p>

<h3>柏油存積不厚</h3>
<p>丨桐油外電趨跌丨</p>
<p>柏油自漢市日跌、浙路總長後、南北背道而馳、此等市面本屬　遇、所出新　暫　之形勢而　久時　、現在漢　各牌新貨已到齊、且聞新貨較上年陳貨爲優、價格又廉、故銷亦因此行動、重荊仍是十二兩七八錢、平荊十二兩三四錢津市高者十二兩、稍次十一兩八九錢、麻城油先曾跌二十一兩四五錢、旋因供不敷求、加起一四錢、現市須十一兩七八錢、蓋因浙路價高、故均向漢市採辦、惟各處淘銷較往年爲遜、斯爲農村經濟破產、百業凋敝、非獨一業然也、本埠行家隨進隨出、客貨雖有續到、亦足隨到隨銷、鮮有積落、幸　廠不即辦貨、專供燭淘用塲、可不致捉襟露肘耳、</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<p>十年後（二）</p>
<p>— 莫及</p>
<p>「可是失敗了，完完全全失敗了！現在又要從新决定一下了，姑娘！」</p>
<p>「你底奮鬥經過，我全知道，我全知道，自從你離開了我以後。」她記起了我底過去。</p>
<p>「不是嗎，］脫離了學徒生活去過工廠，工廠倒了又去唸書。一雙空拳，打到東又打到西，那時我是何等佩服你呵！可是我底爸媽，他們說，你雖掙扎到學校去唸書了，但是畢業出來，至少（官）總沒得做！所以你沒有資格得到我。此地是（老爺），是（富翁），因此爸和媽就把我賣給他們了。</p>
<p>我　住了她底話，沒有一句容我反駁的餘地！她繼續道：</p>
<p>「過去，我完全記得，一點也沒有忘了：我和你要好時，你已經是個實足的奴隷了。起初，你毫沒有反抗，馴馴善善地過着學徒的生活。然而那時我却同情你，我佩服你能耐苦底精神，所以你煮茶，我就给你引火，你燒飯，我就來帮助你，要是我到你們店裏來玩的時候。你也常常到我家來，你底一切疑難問題，我帮同你解决；你受了東家底侮辱和毒駡，我設法安慰你；你脚上受了傷，我就給你弄好吃的東西從我家廚房的窗口處給你。調養了，使你得早痊愈。以這樣的眞情看待你，完全出諸我底心丨我心願與你親　。所以别人說我們的（壞話），我也不睬。你問我，我底心中現在還有我先前呌過（哥哥）的你沒有，請你不要問我了吧，因爲我難過！</p>
<p>「你還記得嗎丨丨我整個的身體曾送給了你：我瞒了母親給你吻，給你擁抱，給你丨丨！你是好人，我至今不怨的，我願望你從奴隷跳到非奴隷，但是現在呀，你仍舊是······」</p>
<p>「祇願望我一個人不做奴隷不行呀！···」</p>
<p>我也流淚了，聽了她從那正眞折溫柔的心中說出來的話。</p>
<p>「你不必淌眼涙，恩！我底話還沒完哪：</p>
<p>「我底爸媽說，他們底預料沒有錯：你不會做官。果然，如今你連一點微細的職業也沒有，我知道你已在挨餓，從奴隷到奴隷，就是你了。最近，我從書本上知道你底肩背上擱着許多重量的石頭！那石頭上便站着許多所謂（有錢人）。但萬想不到，一個曾經同情，帮助過你底奴隷生活的你底迎兒，如今也站上你底肩膀了。請你了解，這點我是痛苦的！在這十年的離别之間，我常常記罣起你，可是始終不能再見你，因此，到現在，你底印象終於模糊了；今天一見，誰知道就是十年來被人世，社會，摧毁，磨折剩了的你呢！」</p>
<p>我站到她底床邊，熱涙滴在她的衣裙上。我感激她能憐憫她先前同情過的弱者。我只向她解釋道：（未完）</p>
<h3>呼籲和平</h3>
<p>— 楊幸之</p>
<p>昨日本報載汪精衛先生近在日内瓦發表一文，爲世界和平疾聲呼籲。汪先生「愛和平」與「維護和平」的精神，誠足以令我們衷心欽敬。</p>
<p>不過，在目前、所謂「和平」究作何解釋？汪先生似乎有點「故裝痴聾」。依我們看：在資本帝國主義統治的世界裏，和平底正確解釋，只是帝國主義列强勢力之均衡，只是「掠奪」與「火併」之加緊準備，軍縮會議中的將爺們之會議縮軍，國聯會議中的爵爺們之會議和平，都只是一顆朦蔽全世界勞苦大衆的耳目的烟幕彈。所以軍縮會議愈是開得起勁，各國的軍備愈是瘋狂般的擴張，國聯會議中愈是苦慮焦思，而英日密約，法日密約的傳說愈是喧傳於世界。拿破崙說得好：「大戰之前，人都說谎。」這眞是資本主義世界裏所謂「和平」的一個最恰當的解釋。</p>
<p>特别是在目前，第三期的資本主義經濟之恐慌，已將列强的均衡勢力打破，使她們都感到末日即將到臨的恐怖與悲哀。因此，世界正在高呌着：「戰爭啊，只有戰爭才是恐慌的出路！」從這樣的因果關係上看來，日本的侵略暴行是偶然的嗎？全世界的觀望敷衍又是偶然的嗎？明白了這一點，我們還有向人呼籲和平的餘地嗎？而且，就令我們希望和平，也應該是「秉公理以致和平，」决不容「以公理殉和平」。一年以來我們天天在呼籲和平，似乎只要能「和平」，什麽事都好商量。老實說，我們是不需要這樣的和平的，我們認爲「眞和平」的確立，必定還灯經過一次全世界總動員的大搏鬭。</p>
<p>寒冬小品</p>
<h3>節季氣候及迷信</h3>
<p>— 郁達夫</p>
<p>田家五行，是一册江浙鄕下農民的寳典，關於冬季的氣候及迷信之類若干條，抄在下面。</p>
<p>十二月下雪，主來年豐稔。初三日雨，主久陰，冬春難得晴。至後逢第三戍爲臘（按今年冬至是廢暦十一月廿五，第三戍爲十二月廿六），臘前後三兩番雪，謂之臘前三白，宜菜麥。　云，若要麥，見三白。又云，臘雪是破，春雪是鬼。又云，一月見三白，田翁笑赫赫。霽而不消，名曰雪待伴，主再有雪。夰臘後東南風多，主來年水大，歲朝如未立春，亦照此占。</p>
<p>十二月十二日，是蠢的生日、嘉湖各地，於此日礼神。</p>
<p>二十四日，謂之小年，吳中人家，必祀灶神，相傳謂係辭灶之意。除夜宜安靜，記云，除夜　不吠，明年無疫瘟。風俗相傳，其夜有行瘟使者，降疫於人間，故宜以黃紙書「天行已過，使者須知」，揭於門額。</p>
<p>十二月謂之大禁月，有一日稍暖，卽是大寒之候，諺云，一日赤膊，三日齷齼。</p>
<p>至後九九氣候諺云，一九二九，相逢不出手。三九二十七，籬頭吹筆樂。四九三十六，衣眼如露宿。五九四十五，太陽開門户（一云，錐刀不人入土，又云，窮漢街頭舞。）六九五十四，貧兒方得志。（一云，籬笆出嫩枝，）七九六十二，布袖擔頭擔。八九七十二，（讀如腻），　狗尋陰地。九九八十一，犁耙一齊出。</p>
<p>從冬至起，計算節季氣候，似乎是東方天文家的習慣。中國則說冬至百六是淸明，日本則說二百十日及二百二十日，定有暴風。元朝征倭，全軍覆沒，蓋通逢着了這二百十日與二百二十日的　風之故。</p>
<h3>雪</h3>
<p>— 琴</p>
<p>白雪緊壓着大地，世界在寒冷下戰傈；但，你相信吧？雪堆裏已孕育了濃厚的春意。</p>
<h3>猴子和鞭子（童話）</h3>
<p>— 大令</p>
<p>有隻猴子在人類社會中玩了很久之後，回到他的老家花果山的荒林裏去，並且帶回很多的物件，有一件就是他偷得的一根皮鞭子。</p>
<p>借着這皮鞭子的威力，征服了所有其他住在這荒林中的羣猴。牠們必須遵從牠的意旨：爲牠採果食，爲　裝滿私有的金銀庫，爲牠收拾好床舖，爲牠預備飲料，爲牠捉身上的　子，爲了保守的地盤去和鄰居的猴子拚命。而　呢，則或是高高地坐在樹枝上望着以自娛，或是抱着很美麗的母猴子享樂，偶然稍不如意，牠便無情地用皮鞭子盡力地抽。牠們天天爲　當奴隷而不得休息。</p>
<p>而且，掌着這鞭子的猴子，更一天一天的兇惡起來，其他的猴子，當是沒有時間爲自已採取食物，夜來了，牠們只有忍着飢餓與疲乏，胡亂地倒在潮濕泥濘的地上，等待第二天的鞭子和工作。</p>
<p>痛苦就是這樣地在這荒林中滿佈着。</p>
<p>一天晚間，一個乏得要死的猴子向牠的老婆發牢騷的說····</p>
<p>『只要那小厮沒有那鞭子在手中，牠眞不足怕。當鞭子還在手中時，我們雖感受一種恐怖的，酷烈的痛苦，但沒有法子不服從牠！』</p>
<p>比牠聰明的母猴子說：</p>
<p>『那小厮一定不會感受那鬼鞭子的恐怖罷！』她的漢子答道：</p>
<p>「我也是這樣想，但，我不明白這是什麽原故。」</p>
<p>母猴　吟了一下，接着說道：</p>
<p>『莫非是因爲那鬼鬼鞭子的柄是拿在牠的手裏罷？』</p>
<p>就從那天起，聰明母猴子的這樣一句有力的話，便在這荒林裏的猴羣間慢慢地傳佈着。於是，有一天，牠們實在忍無可忍了，便大家一齊動手，從那兇惡猴子的手中把皮鞭子奪過來，而讓鞭子的杪子在牠的背上跳舞。</p>
<p>這樣，從此羣猴才能有爲自已採取食物的時光永度着安樂而自由的生活·再沒有那個能壓迫牠們。並且，牠們從此得到了一種富貴的敎訓，這敎訓是：</p>

<h3>時代與愛的歧路（稿續）</h3>
<p>— 張資平</p>
<p>她再望了他的睡顏，愈覺得它是一盎惑。她的週身似乎有點漲熱起來了。她忽然的衝動起來，把自已的溫滑的兩唇送到他的額際來，祇一瞬間，便移到海泉的赭紅色地雙唇上來了。她聞着了一種男性所特有的臭氣。</p>
<p>『他如果一翻身坐起來時，眞不得了！』</p>
<p>她在觀念上是這樣地担心着，但在實際上說，她又希望他能夠醒過來。</p>
<p>但她還是失望了。他只從被窩裏伸出手掌來微擦了一下他的嘴唇，又翻身向裏面，仍然呼呼的睡着了。</p>
<p>（十八）</p>
<p>海泉從夢中驚醒過來時，晨光已經從窗口射進來了。因爲昨晚上給任夫人我灌了幾杯酒，今早晨起來，覺得頭腦内部還微微地作痛。看見時候不早了，忙披衣起來。</p>
<p>『林先生起床了？』</p>
<p>他的左脚剛套進拖鞋裏，就聽見房門呀地一響，鶴子夫人滿臉笑容地走進來了。他一看見鶴子夫人便沉下臉來。</p>
<p>『啊呀，林先生還那樣的生氣！·············我不知要怎樣才好！』</p>
<p>『···································』</p>
<p>海泉很想反詰她，爲什麽還餞留着那個日本佬住在這家裏。不過一反想，又覺得自已實在沒有這個權利。</p>
<p>『今天也要上學去？』</p>
<p>她立在一邊，態度似乎有些戰戰競競的。這却使他有些過意不去了。</p>
<p>『ＥＨ。』</p>
<p>他只答應了這一聲，臉上仍然沒有半點笑容。</p>
<p>『林先生，如果不上學去，我想陪着你到外面去暢頑一天，也有許多話要和你說的。』鶴子夫人始終是微笑着說。</p>
<p>『誰陪你們那些東洋人出去？』</p>
<p>海泉自已也不明白對於她的態度竟會粗暴到這個樣子。</p>
<p>『啊呀！我是說，只我一個人陪你出去哟！』</p>
<p>鶴子夫人像要哭的一樣了。</p>
<p>『你家裏不是有客，你陪他去好了。』</p>
<p>海泉唯恐她不知道他是在痛恨那個日本佬，他忍耐不住，聲音高辣地說出來了。</p>
<p>『不管他。他們會坐在家裏，因爲他們初到上海來，不認得路到虹口那頭去，帶着他們走了兩三天，走得我累死了，也討厭了。誰還願意他們的事！此刻他也認得路了。我也不願意再陪他們一路走了，給外面的人都知道我是日本人！············』</p>
<p>聽見鶴子夫人說了這一大篇話、海泉不禁驚異起來，同時也感着了一些快感，稍稍恢復了　　他的　冷的態度。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>一碼之内</h3>
<p>— 白</p>
<p>據世界新聞社，羅馬訊：據統計的表示，在歐洲諸國中，荷蘭爲國民犯罪最少的一國，而在荷蘭的許多城市中，距海牙東三哩的玉寳城，犯罪者幾乎絕跡，已經數年。這種情形，引起一般犯罪學者的大注意，曾經寫了許多文字來說明原因。最顯明的一個原因，便是因爲玉寳城内對於道德化的管理，較其他任何城市都要嚴格，在家庭，學校和社會上，都以道德爲主。因此，將犯罪的傾向都絕對的掃除掉了。至於道德的標準，獨特而且高尙。即如其道德訓綀中有一條爲；『在公共地方，男女不得在相距一碼之内並坐。』乖乖！好個一碼之内！我們中國人的犯罪沒有統計，大槪在世界上不會沒有地位吧。一般古老先生，愛國之士早已在那里振振有辭，說什麽人心不古，道德日衰了。如今見了荷蘭國玉寳城獨特而且高尙的道德標準，又要大發議論了罷。中國自從洋化以來，簡直愈开愈不成樣了，男女已經能公開的在馬路上手挽手的並走了；大庭廣衆的交際塲裏，居然男的能抱住女的舞起來了；那些長三野鷄之類的女人，又居然能在馬路上大拉其男人來了。這些都足以引起犯罪的傾向電影院裏男女並坐，宴會上男女並席，在我們國裏已經算不得什麽，我想這都是犯罪的根源。如今要防止國民的道德墮落，和减少國民的犯罪，應該即速效法荷蘭國玉寳城的道德訓練，實行男女在一碼之内不得並坐的規律。</p>
<p>好了，好了，這末一來，電影院裏該把男女同志分成兩起了，而且中間至少要相隔一碼了；各游戲塲裏的坐位都要如此辦理了；一切跳舞塲，男女合班的演員，都在禁上之列了。男女同學的坐位，自然也要相隔一碼了；請客的時候，主人應該把男坐位和女坐位也要排得相隔一碼了。</p>
<p>一碼之隔，男女分焉。這末一來，也許我們中國的國民犯罪也就减少了。報紙上也未必會見到姦殺案，姦淫案，自殺案（失戀），盜竊案（因爲窮了還要謟媚愛人，所以行竊）···············了。豈不善哉！</p>

<h3>患凍瘡者注意</h3>
<p>— 承森</p>
<p>在此寒風侵骨的嚴冬氣候之下、往年曾受凍瘡的患處，到此時必繼之而起，在先似癢似痛，異常不適，而一經腐爛，不易痊愈，而其患處必在手足之間，因之行動亦感痛苦異常，市上雖售有藥膏，惟在腐爛之後其效亦鮮，敝人患該症，已有多年，備受痛苦，總難保其不爛，今冬余又患該症，破裂後，行動異常痛若雖塗藥膏，而總難見效，且更其化大，今得親友之丹方，治之，不二日已愈，其效如神，因思患是症者，必不在少數，故今公之於讀者之前，如患該症者不妨試之；</p>
<p>其藥料不過冰片一種，和以蟹殼灰，（用已乾之蟹殼於炭火中煨灰取出即成）兩者各半研而成末，塗於患處，一二日即愈，（該藥塗上後即結成硬殼不宜剝去否則痛而不易痊愈切宜注意之）以上皆爲敝人親自試騐，確有如神之效，患凍瘡諸君，不妨一試。</p>
<h3>口試</h3>
<p>— 依依</p>
<p>星期六的下午，突然傳來了一個消息：說某某銀行招考練習生，叔父呌我跟他去應考。</p>
<p>是的，像我這樣的年紀丨二十一歲，是需要一個職業了，尤其是在現在我可說已經是一個失學的人了的時候，而叔父爲了這事情，也很關心，所以特地來知照我去應那考試，這我自然很銘感的。</p>
<p>雖然是練習生，但我倘能考取的話，我想終比無業好一些。所以心中也有一些喜悅，而就去應考了。</p>
<p>到了某某銀行，我就跟着一個人上樓，到考的地方。主考的人，給了我一張紙，呌我塡寫，我寫了。</p>
<p>「君果能於三年内不結婚乎」。這是那張紙上的一條，我想這是辦不到的，所以就寫了「恐不能」三字。</p>
<p>於是進行口試了，先試英文，一個眼珠滑溜溜的人望着我用英語問了我幾句，最後他問我知道他們的規則麽？我說不知道。他就給我一份招考練習生的章程，其中二條和我不對的：一是年歲需在十九歲以下，一是三年之練習期内，不得結婚，並且需寄宿於該行。關於一，他倒並不對我怎樣。但關於二，他說我非把我那紙上塡的恐不能三字改過不可。</p>
<p>「下面的人是你的誰」？另一個主考的人問我，那就是給我紙塡寫的一個人。</p>
<p>「是叔父」。</p>
<p>「和他去商量商量羆。關於這婚姻的事」。</p>
<p>我就走下去和叔父講，他的意思是寫「能」好了。我跑上去只得說可以的。雖然這是違反我的本心的，但爲了生計二個大字，我免强把那恐不二字畫去，而賸下一個能字。</p>
<p>「你是怎麽地方人」？那眼珠滑溜溜的人問我。</p>
<p>「浙江鎭海」。</p>
<p>「寗波人脾氣大多直的，你的脾氣多直啊」！爲了我的鈍頭鈍腦的回答，他含着譏諷的口氣說。我想倘他不客氣的話，他正要駡我哩。</p>
<p>本來我的脾氣是不大好的，這我自已很知道，但終改不掉，那時爲了那條件的不合我的意思，我的回答自然更使人不快，亦無怪那人要譏諷我了。</p>
<p>飯碗不要不打緊，但二個大字丨生計可不容易辦，　於我受了那准</p>

<h3>少奶的話</h3>
<p>— 文炳</p>
<p>早幾天在朋友家裏，巧遇着幾位摩登少奶，伊們開頭是漫談一些友誼上的别難情懷；其後轉到了結婚前後生活上的比較；末後是談着夫妻間的爭閙。</p>
<p>據說結婚前後的生活，是很難肯定戲們的好壞；誓如婚前的生活，是富有　然的輕適，在心靈深處的世界，全是美化的，詩意的；婚後呢，那就顯然不同了，雖說在物質與精神上，算是有了寄托，但不免有些平凡，要之婚前所過的是幻境的生活，而婚後却是現實的了，人生固然需要現實，可是少奶們總不免有些惘然，呵，靑春的消逝，畢竟是人生的缺陷，我也爲着伊們杞憂。</p>
<p>却說夫妻間，即使是如何的愛戀，總免不了有些吵閙，</p>
<p>滿口蘇州話的Ｃ少奶說：「我與××（指夫）幾乎每日都要爭閙，其原因是最小不過了，譬如理論某一事情，彼此相持未决，過後他總還要說：「今天我的道理是對的，」那眞使人夠氣，於是又要掀起吵閙。有次，午飯之前，婆婆有事出去了呌我招拂一下澆在灶上的小菜，我本是小心翼翼地去弄，呵，糟了，一個金邊菜碗一溜到地上，便是粉碎，心裏慌張極了，他赶來反而哈哈大笑，使我眞有說不出描不像的心火，不由得向他發氣，於是便大閙而特閙。」</p>
<p>其次是位十足上海小姐氣習的Ｓ少奶說：「我最不高興××（指夫）先生的，便是他好歹都弗作聲，隨你如何說，他總是啞口無言，有時候，本是我錯了，他也總是一個弗響，那倒是最氣人不過，有次，正是讌客，婆婆呌我去取四隻銀碟，不意問，　掉一隻，斷了隻脚，嚇得我心一跳，連嘴唇都發白了，我呌他赶快拏去銀樓配好，免了婆婆說少奶弗是，他說是弗要緊咯，我氣了，我駡他，他竟也會冒炎了，於是大閙了「一塲，」</p>
<p>再次是位寜波Ｋ少奶說：「却說××（指夫）總是不輕放我獨自個到外邊去玩，常時要我伴陪着他，他是北平人，</p>
<p>要我學習國語，茶餘飯後；學不會便是閙，平時我的性子是能忍耐的，但他總是喜歡將事情追究，至我再也耐不住，便是一塲吵閙，有次，還是大淸早十點鐘辰光，他的朋友來會了，他因有點事情在做，呌我下樓去招呼，當時我也正忙着梳裝，不免慢去了一息，而他竟放下工作，自已擔前去了，我自然有些沒興致，於是閙了一塲無名大吵。」</p>
<p>這是摩登少奶們的話，讀者們記取</p>
<h3>元旦之前</h3>
<p>— 歐陽錦屏女士</p>
<p>文素媖是個天眞瀾漫的女子，在十七歲的時候，不幸沾染了賭的嗜好：對於麻雀，撲克，花會，牌九，無一不精。幾年來求學心得，反因之盡付流水了。可憐她時運不齋，賭一次，輸一次，點金乏術，債臺高築。正應着「女人好賭，一生潦倒」那句俗話。</p>
<p>這是元旦的前夜罷。門外雪花紛飛，成了一座粉裝玉琢的銀色世界。賭興正豪的素媖，祇希望在兩天内，贏了一二百塊錢，好好地過這次新年，那知事與願違，連她的未婚夫給她過年的十元，費用，也輸去了。急得她一夜睡夢不成，好容易大除日降臨了。家家正預備辛盤卯酒，吃年夜飯，祇有素媖長吁短嘆說：我若是平時不好賭博，那會弄到今日的煩惱呢！一壁說，一壁氣憤憤地冒着雨雪，踏到她的好同學秀芝處，懇求她借十塊錢，求度其新歲。秀芝心裏雖則鄙視媖，可是，想及以前同食同遊之樂，總覺餘昧猶在，依依不忍。還記起素媖以前讀中國史學時的神態，她也雄心萬丈，願步花木蘭，秦良玉的後塵。然而曾幾何時，素媖竟墮入萬惡社會的漩渦，嗜賭如命，未免替她可惜！因向她道：「媖姊，你有所需，當能聽命</p>
<p>一週紀念日本印刷　贈二十二年一月廿八日ＪＡＮＵＡＲＹ２８</p>
<p>，可是，奢華的上海，用錢當用得其當啊！」素媖諾諾連聲，正要走了，給秀芝留着吃夜飯。席間還說一番的勸勉，</p>
<p>眞的，同學有箴規之義務。</p>
<p>素媖道謝，踏出了秀芝門外，逕自回去，途中經過一家大賭塲，給一位女友邀她到裏面小談。爲着連日的狂賭，這時候，素媖已是有神無氣：加以昨夜未曾瞌眼，談不多時，竟悠然而入睡鄕。手裏揑着一張十元鈔票，不提防丢了下來，正落在賭抬的上門。那一羣賭客興高彩烈，還當她壓下這一門呢。而做莊家的，却每次吃賠，心煩意亂，并未注意素媖呼呼的熱臉。不霎時，這上門的十元壓錢，配上加配，足足百元有餘。</p>
<p>一陣的喧聲，素媖醒來了那一位女友對她道：「恭喜恭喜，財運高照！」素媖兀自搖頭，莫明所以。那女友接着道：「你不是方才壓了十元在上門，然後入睡的嗎？你看現在是你勝利了！」素媖慌然大悟，心想從前每賭必輸，今天却有意無心的大贏特贏，頓覺冥冥中自有天數，財物固不能强求的啊！</p>
<p>偶然舉首望時，賭塲的正面，懸着一幅中堂佛像，電燈輝映下，裕外顯出「放下屠刀，立地成佛！」的一行小字來。素媖心靈感動，眞性流露，立刻收了抬上的鈔票，忽忽離了賭塲，走到一家銀行；把一百塊錢，托行員代轉到援助東北義軍募捐會裏去。</p>
<p>爆竹聲聲，新年的第一天光臨了。好啊，覺悟的素媖！</p>
<h3>兩家麵店</h3>
<p>— 唐乾健</p>
<p>今天又是星期日，偌大一座校舍，頓時　　　　　　地像山　　　　　一樣。我獨自坐在狹小的室裏，那些悲哀的往事都乘着這　寂無人的時候，一幕幕像電影機放映在我的眼前；啊！至於現在的飄泊，前途的黯澹，我眞沒有勇氣去想了。無目的地站起來，慢慢地踱出校門；寒風迎面吹來，微微地感覺一些兒寒意，但是在可愛而有暖意的冬日斜照裏，還不覺得剌骨的冷。走向校門對面幾株經過寒風嚴霜剝触而凋殘的柳樹下面站着；忽然抬起頭來看見對面一家姓王的麵店裏，熱騰騰的蒸氣，一陣一陣從鍋蓋裏衝出來，同時在油鍋裏煎着排骨的香味，隔了一條橫街，也可以嗅春，店裏這時已經擠滿了本校的同學，嘻笑聲呌麵聲與跑堂的應聲相和。兩個十七八歲的跑堂，兩袖挽得高高地，額上露出亮晶晶的汗珠兒，東奔西跑地忘得不停，他們生意眞好，買主走了一個又進去一個。我呆呆地看着，忽然使我想起了今年春天的時候，在我站的柳樹旁邊，也有一家搭竹棚的麵店，那時綠柳成陰，籠罩着竹棚的上面，嫩綠色的柳絮，像我們在畫上看見的古裝美人的長袖一樣，臨着春風翩躚飛舞。那時我也曾在竹棚裏很適意地坐着吃麵，在表面上看起來，我就知道他同姓王的麵店在競爭，大家都放出招攬雇客的手段。譬如竹棚這家麵店麵賣十五個銅板一碗，排骨十二個銅板一塊：那嗎王家就各樣少賣一個銅板，并且將麵分成許多種類，以迎合顧客的口味，這樣一來，同學們都跑到王家麵店去吃了，不到好久，竹棚裏的麵店停業了，原因是本錢太少，營業不佳，不能同王家麵店相爭。現在竹栅也拆去了，柳樹也枯萎了，只剩下幾條枝幹在冷風中凄顗。樹旁一塊方地，紊亂地放着幾枝凋殘的柳枝，像墓地一樣的死寂。啊！我記起這塲競爭，我感嘆整個世界，都是充滿了血的鬥爭，國家，個人都時時時刻刻在鬥爭，無論直接的間接的，總是要掙扎奮鬥，抵抗才合於生存啊！人們都欣羡，佩服這王家麵店是個競爭的勝利者，誰去可憐那個竹棚裏的麵店是個淘汰者啊！</p>

<h3>解除婚約的好機會</h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我自失去慈和的父親，爲了麵包問題，不得不别了母親和兄妹，來到一家商店裏充個小職員。每月的收入，倒還勉强足敷維持生活。</p>
<p>人大了，母親和兄長，爲了「男大當婚」的觀念，不由而由地提起我的婚姻問題，我當時也曾詎絕過幾次，終於「母命難違」，就默認下來。不久就接到她的一張相片，算是訂婚的表示。</p>
<p>唉！這種年頭，個人生活，尙且風雨飄颻；那裏有力量來負擔這結婚時而結婚後的費用呢；但是這婚約旣經我本人表示認可，似乎勢在必行；在道德上我已負有爲這不相識的她謀幸福的責任。我於是鼓着勇氣，努力工作，冀獲得較好的地位，解决這急迫的經濟問題；結果我自以爲很圓滿，這却不能不婦功於因訂婚而給我的興奮力了！</p>
<p>光陰似飛般的快，離開訂婚一年多了；但是奇怪得很，怎魔聲息都沒有！想是她······？經幾次的探聽，我才明白；她的心已變了，婚約也無形解除了，我的家鄕丨寳山縣滬太線上一個大站丨已經爲拜金主義所支配；她怕已提風氣之先，摩登化了吧？窮漢子的我，給人家看不起，是應該的呀。</p>
<p>母親和兄長，起初怕灰了我的心，還瞒着我。但紙裏包火，終於不能不穿；賺窮愛富的她，現在要索回原寄的相片呢！給了她罷？不行！她爲何始初要給我呢？</p>
<p>編者先生，我的心弦碎了；請你指示一個對付的方法，那是很勝望而感激的。順請</p>
<p>撰安　趙學淵上。</p>
<p>編者按：趙春過頭婚事，原是因爲「母命難違」而遷就的。據來信自述，個人經濟，尙未　、穩固；本來沒有負擔結婚時與結婚後一切費用的能力；何况對方是一個拜金主義的女子呢！須知崇拜金錢，不事學問道德的修養，而專在外表求摩登化的女子，是最足鄙視的。趙君不幸與此等女子訂婚，那末即使對方不提出解除婚約的要求，也得自動提出；現在對方旣已提出，正可順水推舟，根本解决：又何必戚戚爲哉！末了還得向趙君誠懇地說的，就是與一個卑鄙的人辦交涉，應當處處站住法律上的地位；解約之說，須得先出於對方之口，而且要得到相當的證件；否則彼方許以要猩猩作態，提出無理要求呢？我們遇到卑鄙的小人，應當設法啓迪，即感不能，亦當多方原恕，不宜銖輜必較，也自損人格。趙君此事，祇宜應付，不宜對付；以示大方。</p>

<h3>同情者（十七續）</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>到了第三天，王二嫂收拾一包東西，回娘家去了。她由婆家到娘家，有十五里路之遙，王老二打算用小車推她去，她說不必，慢慢走去，有半天也到家了。王老二以爲她是好意，却也沒有留意。可是自這天起，孟國寳也就不到他家來談天，後來才知道上省去了。過了四天，王二嫂子，還不曾回家來，王老二就自已推了一輛小車，到岳家去接她，到岳家一問，她却不曾回家。王老二初還不相信，後來一問全村子裏人，都說不曾見她，他這才明白，燒鍋的不見了。燒鍋的向來不曾有什麽邪心，也不曾和什麽男人有好意，怎麽不見了呢？這眞是奇怪。他想起燒鍋的那　蛋臉子，長睫毛，黑眼睛，烏頭髮，麵粉團了的手臂，實在捨不得，回家以後，痛哭了兩塲。有人也疑心是孟三先生拐跑了，但是仔細想起來，可不像，其一，三先生最憐惜莊稼人的，而且更可憐王老二。其二，他街城裏的洋學生，怎麽會拐鄕下人，而且是個有夫之婦，其三，他和王二嫂子又沒有一點勾搭的事情讓人看見，王二嫂又不是三歲兩歲的小孩子，三言兩語，就跟人跑了。這都不像，就不能指實是孟三先生拐跑了。王老二也說，孟三先生說過，和我最同情，不會拐我女人的。就是拐了，我一個鄕下人，敢到城裏去找他嗎？若要打官司，我父親爲了打一塲官司，打得家產精光，我也不幹。他有了這樣的表示，這不就算麻糊過去了。不過一月之後，有人和他編了一隻田歌，那田歌是：</p>
<p>十六歲燒鍋的會當家，城裏先生看上了她。城裏頭佳人是胭脂粉啦，鄕下的俏佳人她是水桃花哟！水桃花呀，好讓城裏的才郎摘一把喲！鄕下人折花哓粗泥裏歸，城裏人折花花瓶裏挿呀。這花不是凡間種，怎樣好呌她配冬瓜呀？配冬瓜呀，這是一塲大笑話呀！</p>
<p>碧綠的平板上，向秧都長到二尺開外，長出稻穗子了。王老二依然天天在田裏工作，可是沒有人送茶烟火，也不能唱歌，人家唱歌。他只是呆呆的聽着。鄕下人不可憐他，而且又唱歌譏剌他，表同情的，只有一個孟三先生，又走了，茫茫宇宙，誰是王老二的同情者呢？</p>

<h3>美國影業未來之傾向</h3>
<p>— 神</p>
<p>有聲片的產生，是美國影片銷索的最大原因之一。</p>
<p>有聲片所考究的第一是對白。劇情的樞紐在對白中宣洩，劇情的起伏亦借對白來發揚，假使給一個不通信語的觀衆去看，他所見到的祇是幾個人在這塲面上談一會，笑一會，或者竟然哭一會，又在另一塲面上，有幾個形似劣角Vllian的，在那兒鬼鬼祟祟的議一會。他祇能借重戲院說明書所吿訴他的情節而向着銀幕上的動作去亂猜。</p>
<p>無聲片亦有代表對白的字幕，然而牠不能把沒有表演的面孔一味呆視，一味把口忽張忽閉地現在銀幕上。牠有時寫，亦有劇情的樞紐，却是把動作來表演。我們曾經見到伊密爾琪寗的全片無一句對白的德國片，却從沒有見到像有聲的一般最少有對白五百八十幾句的無聲片。假使你曾經把無聲片的字幕，約略的數一下，至多不過是一百二三十句；像卓别麟導演的「巴黎一婦人」卷數雖不下十本，而字幕却不滿六十句。同樣的「看」，也許同樣的不識外國字，至少我們可以在「看」覺上享受三倍的欣賞。</p>
<p>「影片舞台化，」有聲片就擺不掉這判决！</p>
<p>在去年，我們曾經講得美國少數製片家，在收製法德各國語的副本之外，有加製中國語副本的動議。結果，因爲從中國得來的整個收入，怕不足償攝製的費用，於是終久成了水中明月。</p>
<p>如今又有一叚好消息了：</p>
<p>從前在派拉蒙當製片部經理的拉　蓋　e　　eＬasky發願將澈底改革有聲片的作風，踏進考究對白以外的新園林　。　說：「要恢復影業已往的興盛，以及振起影業未來的威風，當力求保持當年無聲藝術的靜默性，用少數的對白，在演員面部上動作，發表導演者的才力。</p>
<p>這位大製片家如今已加入了福斯，聘用了許多無聲的導演與編劇家，從事於他們的新計劃。我們預料着「成功」是决不能拒絕他們的進取的。</p>

<h3>問問電影觀衆</h3>
<p>— 振年</p>
<p>你們在影戲院裏爲什麽不能鎭靜的坐着看呢？你們終是那樣子擾亂，害别人的視線聽覺，都發生影響。</p>
<p>你們常時把身體移動，好像坐不安席，椅子上面有臭蟲在咬你麽？你們又常把你的頭移到左面移到右面去同你們的朋友講話。</p>
<p>你們要曉得，每一次你們動一動，直接坐在你們後面的，也得跟着動一動，這樣子動下去，有止境麽？</p>
<p>當你們走進一家戲院，你們就立在走路當中紛紛爭論坐在那裏的好，却不防備你們的語聲太大，而又阻碍交通。</p>
<p>音樂響起來，你們是不是是喜歡用你們的皮鞋底在地板上擊拍子？如果全院的觀衆都照你們做，不太熱閙麽？</p>
<p>遇到演員有滑稽的動作，於是你們旁若無人大笑起來，假使有人想聽演員所說的話，就被你們擾亂了。</p>
<p>你們自以爲讀過這本影戲的小說，滔滔不絕講給你們的同伴聽，聲音是愈講愈大，前後左右三四排的人都不能聽到了，可是你得預防，你們是會被他們嘘下去，滿臉害燥的。</p>
<p>還有你們大多數含着香烟看，你們應該把烟往上吐。如果得其所哉一直噴出來，坐在前排的一位就會覺得一陳冷風吹到他的頭頂上，繼之再會嗅到辛辣難堪的烟味。别被人家討厭，别做ＴheaterＰasls</p>
<h3>從舞臺跑到銀幕（上）</h3>
<p>— 紅微</p>
<p>舞臺上的表演，和銀幕上的表演不同，有舞台經騐的人，未必擅長銀幕表演，不過有舞到經騐的人，畢竟較毫無表演經騐的人好一點，所以中外電影演員，有不少是從舞台跑來的。</p>
<p>中國的舞台劇，就最普遍的來說，大約可分三種，就是：舊劇，（指平劇而言，至於粵劇，崑劇，越劇，楊州戲等，流行不廣，人材自亦不多。）新劇，（即俗稱文明戲）話劇，（話劇和新劇，形式上似乎無甚區别，可是新劇的對白，演員只須不失本意，可以隨意搭擋，話劇則必須依照劇本，一字不能增减。）平劇演員正式改入電影界的，只有主演天一有聲影片「小女伶」的袁美雲·至於梅蘭芳的「剌虎，」和最近地雪豔琴譚富英的「四郎探母，」都是把平劇搬上銀幕，而且是臨時性質，不能說是改入影界。粵劇演員的上銀幕的，有薛覺先唐雪卿的攝製「白金龍。」</p>
<p>新劇演員改入電影界的，最佔多數，像以前的鄭鷓鴣，歐陽予倩，林雍容，金玉如等，現在的張振鐸，馬東武，高梨痕，秦哈哈，蕭正中，魏鵬飛，譚志遠，陳秋風等，都是新劇演員。</p>
<p>話劇家近來也有不少侵入電影界，男的有金燄，鄭君里，唐槐秋等，女的有胡萍，艾霞，王瑩，葉秋心，倉隱秋等，現在且把幾位從舞台跑到銀幕的女話劇家來談一下：</p>
<p>胡萍　她是湖南長沙人，曾經加入南國劇社，但是沒有表演過，後來加入大道劇社，方才漸露頭角。她第一次踏進電影界，是在友聯公司主演「海上英雄，」後來又加入陳一棠等創辦的白虹影片公司，主演「緣林豔史，」不過這兩部片子，是沒有意識的武俠片，所以也不被人注意。去年加入明星公司，担任　　「國魂的復活」演員，後又主演「戀愛與生命，」各報上宣傳得非常熱閙，但是該片公映以後，也沒有什麽驚人的成績。她學問很好，能編劇本，最近聽說從事研習英文。</p>
<p>艾霞　她生長在北平，但是她原籍不是北平，她曾經加入應雲衛，洪深，李化等主辦的戲劇協社。寫得一手好字，學問和胡萍不相上下。她的入電影界，最初加入天一公司，在「游藝大會」中一露色相。後來加入明星，担任「舊恨新愁」的主角，表演也只平平，這或許是初上鏡頭的緣故。她和胡萍，有同樣的缺恨，就是「才」「貎」不能兼全。</p>
<h3>美國的明星與法網</h3>
<p>— 泓蓀</p>
<p>維克多麥克勞蘭，忘記償付他的醫藥費洋三百元，被醫生提起訴訟。</p>
<p>史璜生購置了許多精美的傢具，但是遲遲不付貨欵。收賑員已預備訴諸法律，史璜生趕快付還了七千五百元。這纔逃脫了無情的法網。</p>
<p>羅皮雷身體雖漸有起色，然而經濟却陷於絕境。他在法庭上聲稱無力淸償八十二元的債務。</p>
<p>柯爾門因爲山米爾哥聽溫毁了他曾用去數百萬元造成的一些物件。故向法院控吿要他賠償二百萬元的損失。</p>
<p>湯姆密克斯在去年夏天，碰着一位畫師。這位畫師呌他坐着替他畫像。但是忘記說明要收代價的。直至畫好，始向湯姆索取畫資一千五百元，湯姆堅不允付，結果也是訴諸法律。</p>
<h3>「火柴大王」本事（八）</h3>
<p>— 希孟澤</p>
<p>在德國，保羅克魯爾到了新際遇。這係他生平第一次覺得心房跳躍的緊促。這是和爭權奪利不同的，别有一種滋味。他對方是誰？就是德國一位電影明星，她的名字呌瑪泰慕爾娜（這大槪就是影射瑞典怪明星葛雷泰嘉寳和火柴大王克魯格的一段艷事了。）她將保羅世界的迷夢喚醒了去作愛情的迷夢。但是愛情的迷夢，是保羅一生沒有完成的。</p>
<p>保羅的手腕是再靈活沒有的，但是慕爾娜總是寞寞落落的不易就範。有一天保羅在自已私宅義請慕爾娜吃夜飯。他特爲送了她一串精美的金鐲鑽項圈。他已爲慕爾娜一定不會推辭的了，所以他吩咐在他的密室裏預備了盛　，花瓶裏挿了遵貴的玉簪花，銀桶銀冰好人香擯酒，侍者穿了鮮明的服裝，靜待那天上安琪兒的降臨。但是那安琪兒總不降臨。</p>
<p>左等也不來，右等也不來，預定的時間已過了一個鐘頭了。保羅打電話到慕爾娜旅館裏去問，那面說慕爾娜已經出來了。保羅重新布置席面，花瓶裏的花萎了，換上新鮮的，冰桶裏　　的冰化了，再添冰。花又萎了，冰又化了，保羅再打電話去問，那方面綫說慕爾娜小姐於三小時之前已經出遠門去了。</p>
<p>「你不是先說她已經出來到我這裏來的麽？」保羅暴躁的質問他。</p>
<p>「先生，慕爾娜小姐臨走前這樣吩咐的。」那頭說。「沒有，慕爾娜小姐沒有留下通訊地地址。」</p>
<p>保羅克魯爾冷笑了一下，放下電話聽筒。自已想想從來對於世界上的一切，予取予求，未曾一次失敗過，今天乃爲一女子所弄，心中未免有些悵悵不樂。可是他從來不肯自認失敗的。</p>
<p>有一天下午保羅克魯爾在蔭慈堡一爿小客店的門口，正遇見慕爾娜出來。她穿的是行路的衣服。她見了他，心中忐忑了一下，但是已經無法避面了。</p>
<p>「啊，慕爾娜小姐，今天都幸運哪，得與您在此相遇，」保羅柔聲的說。「我就是保羅克魯爾。」他自已說自已的名字，並非自已介紹自已的意思，却是一種自信心的顯露，就是表示保羅克魯爾並非等間之輩，可以隨便侮弄的。</p>
<p>「是的，我曉得」，慕爾娜無意的回答。</p>
<p>「您出去散步嗎？我可以同去嗎？」</p>
<p>她又　疑了一下，最後纔帶笑的說，「自然可以的。」</p>

<h3>Nine-Door Pass Exit Sealed Off</h3>
<p>Official Telegram Denies Loss of Nine-River Estuary</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Harass Stone Gate Stronghold, Our Defenses Repel Them</p>
<p>Our Troops Massing in Formation Between Nine-Door Pass and Stone Gate Stronghold</p>
<p>(Linyu, 13th) At Nine-Door Pass, the two armies are locked in a stalemate. Two enemy aircraft reconnoitered our positions around noon, leaving after more than an hour. The road through Nine-Door Pass has been completely sealed off by the enemy. The enemy outside the pass is also actively constructing fortifications to prevent our forces from attacking. (13th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A certain military expert said that the Japanese army attacked Nine-Door Pass twice the day before yesterday, and has adopted a blockade posture against our army outside the Great Wall. In order to consolidate defenses, our army is taking a straight-line defense with the Rehe border. Yesterday, our army massed its positions between Nine-Door Pass and Stone Gate Stronghold. Rumors that the Japanese army occupied Nine-Door Pass are untrue. The Japanese army's plan is to consolidate the defenses of Yu Pass and prevent troops inside the North Pass from attacking the Great Wall, so heavy troops are being used to put pressure on Nine-Door Pass. (13th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese claim to have occupied Nine-Door Pass, referring to villages and roads outside of Nine-Door Pass. The Chinese troops inside Nine-Door Pass completely adopted a blockade posture last night. There were no fierce battles all night, and a stalemate has formed.

<p>Japanese Army Revises Route of Attack on Rehe</p>
<h3>Chief of Staff Isobe Goes to Jinzhou to Make Plans</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese army's original plan to take Rehe was: 1. Transport infantry and artillery on the Jin-Chao railway to attack Beipiao and advance on Chaoyang and Lingyuan. 2. Advance from Tongliao to Kailu, via Suidong, and spy on Jianping, converging at Rehe Peak. 3. Deploy troops from the puppet Fengshan railway, sending troops out of Yu Pass to contain our army's reinforcements to Rehe. Recently, due to the gathering of volunteer armies on the Rehe border and the concentration of the National Army in the Chaoyang and Kailu areas, the following routes of attack on Rehe have been revised: 1. Concentrate forces in Suizhong, take the route of Baishizu Pass, via Sha Mao Mountain and Old Master Temple, directly to Lingnan, converging in Lingyuan via Guadahai. 2. Concentrate heavy troops in Xinlitun, take Guangfuyingzi to capture Fuxin, intercept Beipiao, cut off the communication of our army, and take Jianping via Dahushan, converging in Chifeng. 3. Advance troops to attack and harass Yu Pass. This time, Chief of Staff Isobe went to Jinzhou to plan and deploy the attack on Rehe. The Japanese troops in Xinlitun have indeed been increasing overnight, but the Japanese army trains that arrived did not disembark.

At dawn on the 10th, they suddenly attacked the defense area of Li Division in northern Nanling, hoping to use a stealth attack to recapture Ishimoto, the evidence of the Japanese plot to invade Rehe. Fortunately, Li Division had tight defenses at ordinary times and immediately fought calmly. When our reinforcements from the Wang Xingjiu Division arrived at 5:00, the enemy began to retreat. Our army suffered very few losses in this battle, and captured 26 enemy rifles, 1 hand machine gun, and 8 enemy prisoners.

<p>Uprising of Muslims in Xinjiang</p>
<h3>Well-Equipped and in Contact with Mongolians</h3>
<p>(Not Without Relation to the Tibetan Army's Invasion, Russians Rumor that an Independent Country is About to Emerge)</p>
<p>(Moscow) A telegram from Istanbul here states that a serious Muslim uprising has occurred in the Turpan region of Xinjiang Province, China. The rebelling Muslims are well-equipped and are now moving north, approaching Urumqi in the border of Outer Mongolia. They have made contact with the Mongolians in Karashar in the northern border of the province and are also communicating with the Muslims on the Indo-Tibetan border. This Muslim [uprising] is likely related to the Tibetan army's invasion of Sichuan, and there must be imperialists trying to take advantage of the current situation to create an anti-China Muslim independent country in Xinjiang, making it a buffer state between China and Russia, like "Manchukuo" in the Northeast. It is heard that the British have been quite active in Xinjiang in recent years, especially in the region where the incident occurred, and a retired military officer named Senberg has conducted so-called scientific expeditions in the region many times. (12th TASS Dispatch)</p>
<p>According to the 1929 British Who's Who, Lieutenant Colonel Senberg served in the British Army for many years. He joined the West Yorkshire Regiment in 1901, serving in Egypt and India. In 1908, he participated in the Indian frontier expedition. After the Great War, he served as the commander of the Singapore Volunteer Corps. In 1922, he joined the West Yorkshire 1st Regiment again. In 1927, he retired.</p>
<h3>He Zhuguo's Speech to Soldiers in the Trenches</h3>
<h3>Our Only Way Out Is to Resist the Enemy with All Our Strength</h3>
<p>(Qinhuangdao) He Zhuguo spoke to the soldiers in the trenches today. A Reuters correspondent was at his side. His speech was recorded by an American film company. Commander He said briefly: Japan is not satisfied with gradually conquering China, and now aims to exterminate the Chinese nation. Therefore, our only way out is to resist the enemy with all our strength. We swear to live and die with the country. This time, Japan launched an unprovoked attack on our Yu Pass. We resolutely resisted it. If the Japanese know that we are determined to die and will not retreat, they may abandon their plan to invade Rehe. He also said that in the battle of Nine-Door Pass, ten Chinese soldiers died and twenty horses were killed. Since Yu Pass has been lost, there is no need to defend Nine-Door Pass. For this reason, the Chinese troops retreated to the rear after a slight resistance. The current position of the Chinese army is easier to defend than Yu Pass because it cannot be reached by naval guns from the sea. He's Chief of Staff told the Reuters correspondent that the daily military ration is one and a half catties of flour and vegetables, and the monthly salary ranges from ten to fifteen yuan, paid on time, even before the Yu incident occurred, and there are no arrears in military pay. Representatives of patriotic groups from Beiping arrived at the front line yesterday to distribute clothing, food, and other supplies for consolation.

Since Chiang and He returned to Nanjing, there has been no unified command, and each has fought on their own. In one year, counties such as Yihuang, Le'an, Nanfeng, Jinxi, Zixi, Lichuan, Yujiang, Yugan, Jing'an, Shanggao, Lianhua, etc., have fallen. Even if they are recovered, nine out of ten families are empty. As for Yongxin, Hengfeng, Ninggang, Xingguo, Yudu, Ruijin, Shicheng, Ningdu, Guangchang, Huichang, Anyuan, etc., they have long been lost to the outside world, and the future danger is urgent. The bandits occupy one-third of the province. Now Linchuan has been captured twice, and Jinxi has been captured three times in two months. 300,000 dying disaster victims. The state is indifferent and does not save them. How can the determination to resist foreign aggression allow the bandit scourge to be restrained?

<h3>British Naval Mediation Proposal Fails</h3>
<p>— Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday's report carried a Reuters Qinhuangdao dispatch stating that British naval authorities in the area had proposed to China and Japan that a British warship serve as a venue for both sides to convene and discuss the possibility of initiating preliminary negotiations. A subsequent dispatch claimed that this proposal had been definitively rejected by both sides. Moreover, according to a Reuters Geneva dispatch, a recent British scheme to persuade China and Japan to resolve the Yuquan (Shanhaiguan) Incident locally has also failed. This indicates that the Great Powers have not yet abandoned their intention to mediate between China and Japan. The British naval authorities, witnessing the escalating conflict in Yuquan and fearing that a Sino-Japanese war would break out, drawing all countries into the quagmire of war and triggering a so-called Second World War, proposed this local resolution to maintain peace. This is indeed a testament to their painstaking efforts. However, what we find peculiar is that the British naval authorities, being stationed on warships in Qinhuangdao, must have witnessed the Japanese military's atrocities in Yuquan, the bombing of the city gates, and the slaughter of the people with greater immediacy and clarity than those far away. Previously, the various barbaric actions of the Japanese military in Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang may have been obscured by one-sided Japanese accounts, or not fully known. But this time, the truth of the Japanese initiation of hostilities is evident. It is no longer possible for the Japanese to deceive. Our country has suffered such great aggression and humiliation. How can we continue to tolerate and negotiate with them? Therefore, the British naval authorities' undertaking of mediation can be said to be superfluous.</p>
<p>Even so, this action by the British naval authorities represents the mentality of the Great Powers. Since the League of Nations accepted the Sino-Japanese issue, our diplomatic representatives have repeatedly protested with factual truths. The League of Nations Inquiry Commission, led by Lytton, has also reported with factual truths. Japan, even during the League of Nations General Assembly, has continued its aggression unabated, showing no regard for the League of Nations. The League's face has been utterly disgraced. Yet, the League of Nations still wants to use perfunctory measures to organize a so-called mediation committee, still hoping that mediation can be effective. Today, before the Nineteenth Committee is about to convene, Japan has once again forcibly occupied Yuquan. Not content with forcibly occupying Yuquan, they have advanced to seize Jiukou, eyeing Rehe and plotting against Pingjin (Beijing and Tianjin). The facts are so clear. Yet, the League of Nations remains silent, turning a blind eye and a deaf ear, calmly waiting for the scheduled meeting to open. I predict that the League of Nations will still only mediate between China and Japan. If mediation is ineffective, they will wait for the next meeting to postpone it further. Premier Wang Jingwei published an article in Geneva stating, "Japan's latest actions not only provide China with further evidence that it must fight to the end to protect its territory and maintain its national existence, but also constitute yet another provocation to the League of Nations." The facts are indeed so. However, the League of Nations will certainly tolerate its provocations. Unless the demon of world war looms at their feet, the illusion of peace will never be shattered. The League of Nations' illusion of peace will remain unbroken. I wonder if the Chinese people, also immersed in the illusion of peace, will remain in that state as well.</p>
<p>Yesterday, our Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent notes to seven countries, including Great Britain, the United States, and France, stating, "The Chinese government cannot be held responsible, in law or in fact, for any situation arising from Chinese troops exercising their legitimate right to resist Japanese aggression." The implication is clear that the Chinese army will resist Japanese aggression. However, once the words are spoken, they must be followed by action. Previously, our diplomatic authorities had never issued any diplomatic documents regarding Japanese aggression that showed a strong intention to resist. This note can be said to be a further step. However, our people are still apprehensive that the government will not follow through with actions. What is expressed in official documents may not be expressed in reality. The Japanese aggression has already occurred repeatedly. It should have been resisted with military force long ago. But the talk of long-term resistance and substantial resistance has been repeatedly proclaimed to our people, yet we have not heard of any preparations for resistance. Today's solemn declaration to the outside world must be different from the declarations made to our own people with mere words. Moreover, the British navy's proposal for conciliation talks has been clearly rejected. Therefore, the only way to protect our survival is to resist. There is no other way to go. However, our people are deeply concerned about saving the country and hope that the government will rise up and take action urgently, so their words are sharp and their demands are deep.</p>
<p>Premier Wang Jingwei issues a full declaration:</p>
<h3>The League of Nations Has No Effective Means, Peace Has Become a Bubble, Negotiations Have Reached Utter Despair, Only Resistance Remains</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Premier Wang Jingwei issued a declaration in Geneva stating that China has determined a policy of simultaneous negotiation and resistance toward the aggressive Japanese. Although negotiation and resistance seem contradictory, they are actually complementary. As a member state of the League of Nations, China has an obligation to abide by the League of Nations Covenant and ensure world peace. Despite being subjected to Japanese aggression, this commitment remains unchanged. It deeply believes that all countries that are also member states and signatories to the Washington Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact will also prioritize compliance with the League of Nations Covenant and ensure world peace, and will be able to determine effective measures against Japanese aggression and implement them in order to achieve this goal. Therefore, China has always trusted the League of Nations and is awaiting a resolution. This is the essence of negotiation. However, during this period, Japanese aggression continues unabated. For the sake of China's territorial sovereignty, the lives and property of its people, it is impossible to passively accept aggression and must rise up in legitimate self-defense. This is the essence of resistance. Negotiation and resistance are mutually dependent and indispensable. Since suffering from the aggression of the violent Japanese, China has appealed to the League of Nations while ordering local officials to fulfill their responsibility to defend their territory, neither provoking nor succumbing. The reason and basis for this lies therein. Since the September 18th Incident, Japan has ignored all resolutions of the League of Nations regarding the Northeast Incident. The Chinese government and people are extremely indignant at Japan's unreasonable barbarism and are also deeply concerned about the League of Nations' indecisiveness. After the January 28th Incident, national anger reached its peak. The Nineteenth Route Army bravely resisted in Shanghai, and the whole country rose up to support them. However, its commitment to complying with the League of Nations Covenant and ensuring world peace remained unchanged. Therefore, while making every effort to resist, it still welcomed the arrival of the League of Nations Inquiry Commission in order to obtain a just and peaceful resolution. After the League of Nations Inquiry Commission's report was published, it thoroughly elucidated Japan's unreasonable aggression and the puppet actions of the Manchurian pseudo-organization. With the truth revealed, public opinion was established. The Chinese government and people, although having different opinions and regrets regarding the measures proposed in the report, that the handling was clear but the power of sanctions was still weak, were all willing to accept its general opinions and discuss them openly. However, Japan blatantly disregarded it and acted increasingly perversely. Knowing that the Nineteenth Committee was to convene on January 16th, it gathered naval, land, and air forces to destroy Shanhaiguan on January 2nd, challenging and provoking again. This action not only made the Chinese government and people deeply aware that Japan will never repent and that there is no way to extricate themselves from danger unless they exert all their strength in a desperate struggle, but it also made the Chinese government and people believe that the League of Nations has reached the final line in whether it can fulfill its covenants and ensure world peace. If the League of Nations, even at this time, cannot determine effective measures and implement them, then the Chinese government and people will feel that the policy of simultaneous negotiation and resistance that they have always adhered to cannot be continued. In other words, so-called negotiations will reach utter despair. Moreover, this not only relates to China's imminent crisis of survival, but also concerns the League of Nations' own value of existence. The League of Nations exists for the purpose of maintaining world peace. If it cannot make a fair judgment and effective disposition of the dispute between the two member states, China and Japan, then the original purpose has already been violated. Furthermore, it is unknown how to control those who are still effective. The ideal of peace has become a bubble, and the scourge of war will be endless hereafter. China has always been a peace-loving nation. Japan's propaganda that the Chinese people are boycotting Japanese goods is due to Japan's aggression against China. Japan does not seek the cause of this but only wants the Chinese government to forcibly force the people to take this passive patriotic action, and even accuses this deplorable patriotic action of disrupting peace. Even worse, it has expanded propaganda claiming that the Chinese Kuomintang's nationalism is harming world peace. Little does it know that the meaning and content of the Chinese Kuomintang's nationalism are fully explained in President Sun Yat-sen's lecture on nationalism. It is based on the ideals of universal love and equality, encouraging the Chinese nation to strive to shoulder the obligations that civilized nations should fulfill in order to enjoy the rights that civilized nations deserve, using China's freedom and equality as a foundation, and aiming for world harmony as its ultimate goal, which is precisely beneficial to world peace. What harm is there? However, what we must solemnly declare is that China certainly loves peace, but what it loves is righteous peace and fair peace. If it wants to persecute China with violence and make it fall into the abyss of submission, then our nation must constantly fight for righteous peace and fair peace. The Japanese side's propaganda says that China has no organization and no ability to equip a modern state. We cannot admit to these slanders. Even if there are one or two approximations, we do not deny them, and we are now striving to improve them. However, we still cannot remain silent. What is the most important reason why China's progress has been slow for decades? Is it not the force of Japanese obstruction? The progress that China has painstakingly achieved has been destroyed by Japan with violence, making it wither before it is finished. During the January 28th Incident last year, the cultural institutions organized by China in the Shanghai area, such as universities and libraries, and economic institutions, such as yarn factories and emerging industries, were almost completely destroyed by Japanese aircraft and bombs. These buildings were not military installations, and the bombs dropped by Japanese aircraft were clearly aimed at a specific target and were not inadvertently affected. Japan does not want China to advance into the perfection of a modern state, first destroying it with violence and then slandering it with poisonous mouths. The evidence is so clear. Moreover, China has a history of more than four thousand years and is the trunk of Eastern culture. All its customs cannot be completely the same as Western culture. China is striving to imitate the strengths of Western culture, but it cannot abandon all of its inherent culture. Therefore, the standards of a so-called modern state may need to be re-evaluated in the future. If you list one or two things that Western modern countries have but China still lacks, and use them to prove that China has no qualifications as a modern state, it is not a sound argument. Moreover, with China having such a long history, with its vast land and large population, if it cuts itself off from the maintenance of world peace and puts its full strength into a long-term struggle with Japan, then China's sacrifice will certainly be great, and the impact on the whole world will be unimaginable. Moreover, once the killing is started, how can it be limited to China and Japan? This cannot but be noticed by the organs that uphold world peace and the representatives who preside over world opinion. (Central News Agency, 12th)</p>
<p>Mediation of the Sino-Japanese Case Is Clearly Hopeless</p>
<h3>The League of Nations Prepares to Draft a Report</h3>
<p>Whether There Is a Determination to Compel Is Still Difficult to Predict; Seeking Appropriate and Effective Measures Still Lies in Self-Defense; The Drummond Case Fully Accommodates Japanese Demands; British Support for Japan Is Obvious; Small Countries Express Deep Dissatisfaction</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) It is confirmed that the League of Nations, despairing of mediation, has been planning in recent days to draft a report based on Article 15, Paragraph 4 of the Covenant. Whether the book can be submitted after the meeting on the 16th is still unknown. If the 19-nation Special Committee is based on the Lytton Report, it may be able to produce an impartial report. If the League of Nations blindly accommodates Japan, it will accelerate the decline of its dignity. The government pays close attention to the content of the report. Regardless of the content of the report, whether it can be passed smoothly at the meeting, and if there is opposition, whether the League of Nations has the determination to enforce it are difficult to predict. Therefore, there are many hidden reefs ahead, and the appropriate solution to the dispute, the effective method is still self-defense. (Central News Agency, 13th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A diplomatic dignitary told a reporter from a certain news agency that the League of Nations' 19-nation committee will meet on the 16th and is expected to impose effective sanctions on Japan's aggressive actions against China. Our country intends to request the application of Article 16 of the Covenant, but whether the League of Nations has the courage and determination to accept this request is still doubtful. It is generally speculated that the League of Nations may apply Article 15, Paragraph 4: "If the dispute cannot be resolved, the Council shall, with the unanimous or majority vote, issue a report stating the facts of the dispute and the recommendations that the Council deems fair and appropriate." The so-called fair and appropriate recommendations will probably be based on the Lytton Report. If this method becomes a reality, it will not be beneficial to China. Although the Lytton Report has its fair parts, the recommended parts are not beneficial to our country. Moreover, at this meeting, the French representative, in order to maintain the Covenant and consolidate its own interests, will definitely strongly oppose Japan's violent aggression against China. Although the British attitude is not clearly expressed, it is expected that it will not be a accomplice and lose world sentiment. (Special dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Dr. Yan, the chief Chinese representative in Geneva, notified League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond today that he had received a telegram from the National Government denying that it had sent personnel to negotiate with the Japanese authorities regarding the Japanese military's unprovoked occupation of Yuquan. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>(London) The Executive Committee of the League of Nations Association convened a meeting here today specifically for the Sino-Japanese issue and passed a resolution advocating that the League of Nations take vigorous action to resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute. The Lytton Report should be fully accepted immediately, and the League of Nations should urge the two parties to hold a meeting to resolve the dispute based on the report, and a committee to investigate the facts should be organized on the spot to fairly report the events in the contested area to the League of Nations on a daily basis. Those present today included Sir Chamberlain, Lord Lytton, and Lord Peser. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The chairman of the 19-nation committee, Foreign Minister Simon of Belgium, will return to Geneva tomorrow. The 19-nation committee will meet on Saturday. The draft resolution proposed by the League of Nations in December was rejected by both China and Japan. It was originally scheduled for the chairman to try to get both countries to agree during the holidays. Unexpectedly, incidents occurred since mid-December, causing the chairman to be unable to fulfill this responsibility. However, the 19-nation committee was unwilling to fail and will ask Simon and five others to form a committee to contact the two countries. Now that British Foreign Secretary Simon has arrived here, morale has been boosted, and perhaps efforts will be renewed to enable China and Japan to accept the draft resolution proposed in December. (Havas, 12th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Japanese representative office convened a representative office meeting at 6 p.m. tonight. Sawada, Sugimura, Nagaoka, Sato, Matsuoka, and others were all present and held secret talks for five hours. It is said that the content of the secret talks was the Sugimura-Drummond case. Japan opposes only the item that the Conciliation Committee invites China and Japan to participate in joining a third country because it fears being bound by it after the resolution. If the League of Nations is willing to compromise on this point again, then Japan is happy to accept it. Therefore, it was decided to send Matsuoka to consult with Simon, Sato with Simon, and Sugimura with Drummond. According to Japanese sources, in the current situation, if the League of Nations imposes compulsory mediation in accordance with Article 15, Paragraph 4, Japan may not immediately withdraw from the League of Nations. It can only temporarily remain in the League of Nations to observe the results and then decide whether to leave. (China United Press, 12th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations' Drummond case is coercing our country with a compromise between Britain and Japan. It is obvious that our country cannot agree to this case. Recently, there has been a strong rumor here that the Chinese public is angry at the League of Nations for failing to resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute and will use force to recover the lost land and recapture Yuquan. Representatives of various countries are very pessimistic about the future of mediation. Moreover, because British policy is too pro-Japanese, small countries are gradually opposing the great powers' disregard for world justice. (China United Press, 12th)</p>
<p>Britain and the United States Are Concerned About Yuquan and Rehe</p>
<h3>(Warning to Japan) British Ambassador Visits Uchida; Stimson Meets Debuchi</h3>
<p>French Ambassador to Japan Returns Early</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to reliable sources, British Ambassador Lindley, under orders, visited Foreign Minister Uchida at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday for friendly talks. It is said that the British ambassador stated that the situation is serious after the Sino-Japanese conflict in Yuquan, which will hinder British interests in North China, so he asked the Japanese government to pay attention to it. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Japanese Ambassador to the United States Debuchi visited Stimson on the 12th. The content of their meeting has not been released. However, Ambassador Debuchi told reporters after the meeting that Stimson questioned whether the Japanese army intended to occupy the entire province of Rehe. I replied that whether the Japanese army succeeds in capturing Rehe depends on the activities of Zhang Xueliang and the Chinese army. If Zhang Xueliang's army approaches the railway, the Japanese army will naturally be responsible for protecting Manchuria and its interests in accordance with the obligations under the treaty (probably referring to the Japanese-Manchu protocol). Manchuria regards Rehe as part of its territory, just as Zhang Xueliang regarded Rehe as part of Manchuria when he held power. (Japanese United Press, 13th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) French Ambassador to Japan Mald, who was said to be being transferred, departed from Paris today and returned to Japan early. It is said that the reason why the French ambassador rushed back is that the League of Nations' mediation of the Sino-Japanese dispute has become hopeless, and the situation in the Far East will become increasingly serious in the future. In order to sort out the complex diplomatic issues in the Far East, he could not but return to office early. (China United Press, 13th)</p>
<p>(London) The Times editorial today stated that there is no doubt that the Japanese army's ultimate goal is to seize Rehe. What outsiders are most concerned about at present is that the war should be limited to one area and should not extend to mainland China. The Japanese plan to make Shanhaiguan a neutral area thereafter is not unreasonable. However, if the war spreads near Pingjin, the great powers will hardly remain silent all the time, and at that time, there may be joint action centered on the League of Nations. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<h3>U.S. President Vetoes Philippine Independence Bill</h3>
<p>(Reason) After Independence, the Philippines Will Be Isolated and Helpless, Unable to Resist Japanese Aggression; Chinese Immigrants... (National Society, Washington dispatch, 13th) U.S. President Hoover has vetoed the Philippine Independence Bill and has issued his reasons, which were sent to Congress today. The main point of Hoover's veto is that he firmly believes that an independent Philippine nation will be unable to resist the armed invasion or peaceful immigration of Far Eastern peoples. His words clearly refer to the fear that the Philippines' independence may lead to Japanese armed invasion or the continuous immigration of Chinese people. The U.S. President's veto message is quite clear and decisive, stating that the bill is not practical and is unsound economically and dangerous from an international standpoint. He first stated that since the United States purchased the Philippines, it has had a threefold responsibility to its own people, the Filipinos, and the world. The freedom of the island must be carried out step by step, but this step should be based on convening a citizens' assembly in fifteen or twenty years. Then, he expressed doubts about the basic moral and economic interests of the case, saying that from a moral standpoint, it should be strongly opposed because we have a responsibility to the world to create complete freedom for the Filipinos and should not create a source of chaos for private gain. This case cannot fulfill this responsibility and may create a danger of chaos. The economic life of the Filipinos will still depend on preferential trade with the United States for many years to come. If independence is allowed at this time, the entire financial system of the island will be in danger. To eliminate this crisis, many years of economic preparation are still needed. It was then said that the motivation of this case may be to rescue certain agricultural interests, probably to eliminate the competition of Philippine coconut oil with American butter, Philippine sugar with American sugar industry, and Philippine hemp rope with products of countries closer to the West. But this case may not be able to obtain the expected relief, because in practical terms, the tax-free quantity of these competitive goods stipulated in this case is more than the import amount of sugar and coconut oil in 1928. It was then said that the autonomous status within ten years before independence stipulated in this case will weaken the U.S. civil power on the island. At that time, all the real power of the United States will be limited to certain economic events and vetoing the bills passed by its legislature. However, the United States still bears the full responsibility for the island's financial affairs and local security. This situation is prone to disaster.</p>
<p>Finally, it discusses the dangers of armed invasion and peaceful migration by neighboring nations, saying that once the Philippines is independent, isolated and helpless, it will be unable to prevent this invasion and migration. Moreover, the current instability in the Far East increases the political dangers, whether it is independent or in an autonomous status.</p>
<p>Hoover Presents His Views In his veto message on the Philippine Independence Bill, U.S. President Hoover, in addition to stating his reasons for the veto, also put forward his own plan, advocating that independence should be allowed after the Philippines convenes a citizens' assembly, and the date of the meeting should be fifteen or twenty years later. During this preparation period, the current cabinet system should be expanded first, the powers reserved by the United States should be reduced, and Philippine immigrants should be immediately restricted to protect American workers. Before convening a citizens' assembly, the United States and the Philippines should enter into an agreement, following the precedent of Cuba, to discuss each other's commercial preferences, but its scope should be broader than that of Cuba. Before the Philippine people convene a citizens' assembly, the United States should also make it clear whether it will completely withdraw its naval and land-based bases in the Philippines and whether it will abolish the moral and other responsibilities it bears for maintaining the independence of the Philippines. But at present, both the United States and the Filipinos cannot decide on this necessary final step. (National Society, Washington dispatch, 13th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Left-Wing Leader Arrested</h3>
<p>Related to a Major Incident</p>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Dentsu): A certain doctor of law, the leader of the long-silent Left-Wing Forum, was arrested last night and has made a full confession. Half a year after a major incident, the doctor disappeared and was hiding in the home of a certain calligrapher in Nakano, Tokyo. During this time, he contacted special parties through a certain disciple he loved. This spring, the authorities arrested the younger brother of the doctor in a certain major incident and investigated where the doctor was, but his younger brother did not tell the truth. However, the authorities believed that it was a pity that a scholar like the doctor was not heard of in academic circles, so they advised his younger brother to abandon everything from the past and return to academic circles. His younger brother then decided to hand over a letter to the detectives at the doctor's hiding place. The doctor was an important figure in a certain major incident. During these two years, he gave up all his property, causing his family to fall into poverty. His second daughter, Umeko, became a female clerk at the Hankyu Department Store.</p>
<p>Greek Cabinet Overthrown</p>
<h3>Romanian Government Resigns</h3>
<p>Athens, 13th (Havas): The Theotokis cabinet was overthrown in the House of Representatives by 91 votes to 109. (National Society, Athens dispatch, 12th) The reason for the resignation of the Greek cabinet is that the opposition party, which occupies a majority in Congress, pointed out that the chiefs of the army and navy used high-pressure methods, so they no longer trusted the cabinet.</p>
<p>Bucharest, 12th (Reuters): The Romanian Mallu government resigned today because King Carol did not approve the dismissal of two police officers, causing a conflict with the cabinet. Since King Carol returned to the country to take office in 1930, he has given special treatment to those who supported him before, so he has repeatedly clashed with the cabinet. The Romanian Foreign Minister rushed back to Bucharest from Switzerland to participate in the cabinet meeting because the situation was serious. It is expected that former Prime Minister Fartata will be ordered to form a cabinet. Mallu took office as Prime Minister in December 1927 and has been in office for five years. He has made many improvements to national affairs.</p>
<p>German Farmers and Workers Have a Negative Feeling</p>
<h3>Agricultural Group Issues Declaration Provoking the Government</h3>
<p>Berlin, 12th (National News Agency Telegram) - The dispute between the government and farmers' groups has clearly become the most noteworthy event in German politics. The distant cause of this matter originated from the dispute between agricultural workers and industrial workers. The animosity between them has been brewing for a long time. Recently, farmers' groups suddenly issued a declaration stating, "The country's agriculture has been sacrificed for the benefit of wealthy and powerful international export industries." Today, the German Industrial Federation issued a rebuttal. Both sides used extremely strong language to attack each other, which is enough to make the situation even more tense. The industrial sector believes that the impact of economic depression on the industrial sector is greater than that on farmers. The news announced by the farmers is actually a provocation to the industrial sector. At the same time, the public opinion circles also have a tendency to join the movement. According to left-wing newspapers, "The sudden provocation of the government by the farmers' groups this time is actually due to the activities of the National Socialist Party members in the group." Other newspapers mostly said that the farmers' arbitrary slander against the national authorities this time is unreasonable.</p>

At ten o'clock in the morning, the sound of cannons rose, reporting that the Queen had given birth. So the crowd rejoiced. When the sound of cannons reached twenty-one, it suddenly became silent. So, the faces of the people showed a look of frustration. It was predetermined that one hundred and one cannons would be fired for the birth of a son, and twenty-one cannons for the birth of a daughter.</p>

<h3>Japanese Military's Force Invading Rehe</h3>
<p>(Nakamura Talks About Attacking Rehe as an Emergency Strategy, Rumors Are Rife in Pingjin, Rents Soar, Japanese Residents End Business, Women and Children Return Home)</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Yucheng has fallen, it has been nine days now, the Shihe River, which is only separated by a belt of water, has become a ditch between the enemy and our two armies, the enemy is building permanent shelter fortifications on the east bank, and we are arranging solid defense on the west bank, the enemy has no intention of invading the west, and we have no intention of counterattacking, every day the patrols of both sides meet, each firing a few shots, if I look east with a telescope, the Rising Sun flag on Yucheng can be clearly distinguished, I don't know what the leader of the Northeast Army, who was the first to resist the Japanese, thinks of it.</p>
<p>The information from all aspects of the General Staff can be summarized as follows: the enemy has decided to attack Rehe. Before Rehe is occupied, in order to disrupt our rear, at most, they will attack down Chaozhou. Or they will use planes to drop bombs in various towns and towns in Pingdong. The two places of Pingjin can obtain a short period of peace, or the abolished lunar New Year can also be safely passed, because the commander of the Japanese army stationed in Tianjin, Nakamura Kotaro, has told foreign reporters that if the Chinese army does not provoke the Japanese army in the Pingjin area, he believes that there will be no war in Pingjin. Nakamura has not denied the attack on Rehe. He said, "Zhang Xueliang has transferred a large army to Rehe, attempting to occupy Yixian and Jinzhou, cut off the Japanese army's communication, and subvert the Manchukuo. Japan, in order to implement the Japan-Manchukuo military agreement, has to take countermeasures against Zhang Xueliang's attempt. Therefore, taking Rehe is a necessary emergency strategy." According to the news obtained by British and American people, the enemy's force attacking Rehe, which has now been identified, includes the 8th Division of the West Righteousness, and a cavalry brigade. The two brigades of Chinese traitors Cheng Guorui and Li Jichun, etc., have recently transferred the second division of Duomen as a reserve team for attacking Rehe. The Changgu Third Brigade and the Amano Fifteenth Brigade under the jurisdiction of the division have been opened to Jinzhou Goubangzi Dahushan area in batches from Harbin Shenyang. The Jinzhou aircraft field is parked with more than 30 enemy aircraft, Yixian Xin,</p>
<p>There are more than 20 enemy aircraft parked at the built aircraft field. Every day, three or five aircraft fly to Kailu Lingyuan Chaoyang Dushan area to scout and distribute leaflets to incite the people's hearts. A large number of military supplies have been transported to Yuguan Jinzhou recently. There were originally 12 enemy ships parked in Qinhuangdao, but now only three remain, and the rest transported the Marine Corps to the middle coast of Huludao. There have been several clashes on the border of Rehe, but not formal contact. The fierce battle should be a week later. The Suzuki Brigade attacked the Jiugate Pass and Shimenzhai, and had a conflict with our army, but there was no follow-up report, so the truth is unknown. In the two places of Pingjin, rumors have been rife recently. Only the East Jiaomin Lane in Beiping is the happy nest, and the British and French concessions in Tianjin are the safe. A guest from the old capital said that in addition to the embassies, all the houses in Dongjiaomin Lane are overcrowded. A certain house hides many Tang and Song rare books, and rented a horse shed from a certain house in Dongjiaomin Lane, with a monthly rent of 600 yuan, and prepaid three months' rent at one time. Taking this one example, others can be imagined. The price of houses in the British and French concessions in Tianjin has suddenly increased tenfold. The rent for each room was 78 yuan ten days ago, but now it is not rented for 780 yuan. The horror phenomenon in Tianjin, the British and French concession real estate companies, cannot dismiss a part of the phenomenon. The British and French concession real estate have spare rooms for rent, but they are looking for another paradise and fleeing to Taiyuan and Suiyuan. The public is confused about the situation in the front, and the enemy is manufacturing all kinds of false news to confuse people's hearts. In Tianjin, there are three places: one is the Japanese Military Department's Telecommunications Office, the second is the Japanese Consulate General's Intelligence Office, and the third is the Electric News Agency. Every day, they compile and translate texts in English, German, and Russian, and give them to various foreign newspapers, free of charge. Every day, no less than 10,000 or 20,000 words, and welcome all newspapers to visit their propaganda organs. Even at night, there are people in charge of reception. Looking at the various governments of our provinces and cities and the First Military Department, there is not a single word of propaganda. When Chinese and foreign reporters encounter dubious news and want to find out more, it is impossible, so that there must be different rumors about the situation in the front every day.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Yuguan War, people's psychology has become tense. Provincial Chairman Wang Xuezhong sent personnel to negotiate with Nakamura, hoping that the Japanese army would not conduct exercises in Chinese territory during this period of unrest. Nakamura immediately agreed. In the past week, the Japanese army has only been exercising in the concession. The Japanese military also secretly ordered Japanese residents to end business, stop importing goods, and send women and children who wish to return home or go to Dalian for free. From this one thing, Tianjin will eventually have an incident. (January 11)</p>
<p>Panic in Guangdong's Financial Circles</p>
<h3>Millions Lost in Silver and Money Industries; Many Large Stores Close Down</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The large stores of Guangdong Province have shown signs of decline since the beginning of winter due to various factors. As the Lunar New Year approaches, the monetary situation is becoming increasingly tight. Several rice shops and major rice stores in Sha Ji and other areas of the city have closed down in recent days, owing more than ten thousand dollars. News of other stores closing down is heard daily. Recently, major silver firms in the silver industry have closed their doors one after another, causing great panic in the financial sector. The silver industry in Guangdong Province has been in a state of turmoil since last year. By the end of the year, the losses were impossible to cover, and bankruptcy had to be declared. This indirectly affected other commercial firms. Even silver firms with previously high credit ratings are now facing a run on deposits, leaving them at a loss. It has been found that among the major silver firms that have recently closed down, Yisheng Silver Firm on Jianglan Street had its owner and staff flee on the 8th, owing more than ten thousand dollars. On the same day, Quanxin Silver Firm on Guangfu South Road owed about 400,000 to 500,000 dollars in deposits, and Changan Silver Firm on Thirteenth Street owed about 100,000 dollars in deposits. On the morning of the 9th, Zhenxiang Store on Guangfu South Road also declared bankruptcy. The store had been in business for six or seven years with a prominent credit rating. Recently, business failures made it impossible to maintain operations, resulting in debts exceeding one million dollars. The total external debt owed by the above silver firms is nearly two million dollars. Various creditors have formed creditor associations, asking the municipal chamber of commerce to help liquidate the debts. People in the silver industry are deeply concerned that the closure of these silver firms will trigger a domino effect. A meeting has been convened by the silver industry association to discuss ways to maintain the financial situation in the future, so as to avoid expanding the crisis. In addition, in outer municipal areas, such as Jiangmen and Zhaoqing, commercial prosperity zones have also seen a series of silver firm closures in recent days. The Jiangmen Chamber of Commerce has established maintenance measures to restrict deposit withdrawals. In order to maintain the market situation during the Lunar New Year in Shantou and to provide relief from high interest rates, the white slips issued previously, with short-term durations, have been changed to long-term durations, and long-term durations have been changed to extended dates, so that the silver industry can be maintained and survive through the Lunar New Year.

<h3>The Japanese Representative's Tone is Belligerent</h3>
<p>Matsuoka said, "The Chinese representative has reserved the right to raise objections to the statements made at the next meeting. However, I would like to remind the Chinese representative that I am not asking them to debate the Tanaka Memorial. The document is a forgery, and there is no need to argue about it. But since the Chinese representative has made a definite accusation, they should provide evidence to substantiate their claim. I hope the Chinese representative will not forget my request at the next meeting."</p>
<h3>The Chairman Invites Lord Lytton to Attend</h3>
<p>At this point, the chairman invited Lord Lytton, head of the Commission of Enquiry, to attend. The chairman also said, "The members of the Executive Yuan have carefully listened to the speeches of the Chinese and Japanese representatives last Monday and this afternoon. The members of the Commission of Enquiry have also accepted the invitation of the Executive Yuan to attend and listen to the views of both sides. I am convinced that the members of the Executive Yuan are very concerned as to whether the members of the Commission of Enquiry, after hearing the statements of China and Japan, have any intention of adding to or amending the statements made in the report. If the members can agree, then I propose that the members of the Commission of Enquiry convene a meeting to consider this question and report their views to the Executive Yuan as quickly as possible within the scope of convenience. Can all members agree to this?"</p>
<p>"Matsuoka": "We do not object to the chairman's proposal, but what should be clearly acknowledged is that any opinion expressed should be the opinion of the Commission of Enquiry as a whole, and not the opinion of any individual member. Another point to note is that, in our view, the mission of the Commission of Enquiry was completed after it submitted its report to the Executive Yuan. Therefore, according to the task of the Commission, it is beyond the authority of the Commission to discuss or express opinions on the statements or memoranda issued by our government or by me."</p>
<p>"Chairman": "Regarding the first point raised by the Japanese representative, it should naturally be the opinion of the Commission of Enquiry as a whole. Regarding the second point, I believe that the Commission of Enquiry still exists until the Executive Yuan officially dissolves it. Therefore, if the Executive Yuan wishes to know the overall opinion of the Commission of Enquiry, it may as well consult it."</p>
<p>"Matsuoka": "I am afraid that the Chairman has misunderstood what I said. Page 138 of the Commission of Enquiry's report states, 'Our work is now complete.' We fully agree with this statement. The work of the Commission of Enquiry was completed when it completed its report. Therefore, we believe that the Commission has no right to make any criticisms or express any opinions on any events after the completion of the report. This is our position. If the Executive Yuan does not agree with this point, then I must express my disagreement and reserve our position."</p>
<p>"Chairman": "In my view, the work of the Commission of Enquiry should not be completed until the Executive Yuan has formally dissolved it. According to past practice, after any commission of enquiry is formed, its chairman often attends meetings of the Executive Yuan to answer questions, so as to explain various points in its report. There are already many such precedents."</p>
<p>"Yuan Representative": "I only represent the Chinese government in endorsing the chairman's proposal to invite the Commission of Enquiry to express its views. Since the representatives of China and Japan have already made lengthy statements in the Executive Yuan, especially the Japanese representative who has commented on the factual parts of the Commission of Enquiry's report, we should give the Commission of Enquiry an opportunity to express its views. However, I still have opinions on what the Japanese representative stated today, which I will express at the next meeting. It seems that the Commission's statement of opinion should wait until after I have finished expressing my opinion."</p>
<p>"Matsuoka": "I fully sympathize with the feelings expressed by the Chinese representative, but in order to avoid misunderstandings, I must state one point. In our view, the work of the Commission of Enquiry is completed after it has completed its report. Thereafter, it cannot express opinions or make criticisms. We must act according to the rules. If my interpretation is wrong, then I am willing to withdraw it. However, I still have significant doubts about this point."</p>
<p>"Chairman": "I would like to explain my proposal. I am not suggesting that the Commission of Enquiry should add to or change its report. However, I ask the members to meet and discuss whether they have any intention of changing or adding to the opinions stated in the report after they have heard the views of both China and Japan, and to report the facts to the Executive Yuan."</p>
<p>"Matsuoka": "This is what we object to. We have many doubts about this and must reserve the right to study it further."</p>
<p>"Lytton": Sir Lytton rose and said, "I would like to express, on behalf of my colleagues, our thanks to the Executive Yuan for giving us the opportunity to express whether we have any intention of adding to or changing our opinions in the report after hearing the statements of both China and Japan. However, since the opinion I express should be the opinion of the Commission of Enquiry as a whole, I cannot, of course, make any statement now until I have met with my colleagues to discuss it. We will meet tomorrow to discuss this point. As for the point raised by the Japanese representative, I dare say to the Japanese representative that after the members of the Commission of Enquiry returned to their countries, they did not meet, nor did they express opinions or take any action in the name of the Commission of Enquiry. As for the proposal of the Executive Yuan, it is not asking the Commission of Enquiry to criticize the statements made by the Chinese and Japanese representatives, but only asking them to express whether they have any changes to the opinions in the report."</p>
<p>"Chairman": "Apart from the reservation made by the Japanese representative, have the members of the Executive Yuan all agreed to my proposal?" (No one objects) (Debate completed on the 23rd) (To be continued)</p>
<p>Crisis of Commerce in Jiangxi Province</p>
<h3>Exports Have Disappeared, Finance Has Lost Balance, Outwardly Strong but Inwardly Weak, the Trend of Defrauding is Extremely Prevalent</h3>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Due to years of banditry in Jiangxi Province, the economy is withering, and the entire province's commerce is trending towards crisis. It has been found that the commerce of Jiangxi Province can be divided into three major parts: A. In terms of exports, (1) rice is the main export product of Jiangxi Province. In the past, exports were at least one million dan (a unit of dry measure), and the average price per dan was eight yuan, worth eight million yuan. Last year, due to bumper harvests in various provinces and the dumping of foreign rice, exports disappeared. Farmers are in dire straits, and rice merchants have suffered a setback. Even the Nanxun Railway and various transit stations have lost one million yuan in freight revenue. (2) Jingdezhen porcelain is sold all over the country and in overseas markets in Europe, America, Southeast Asia, and Japan. Last year, due to sluggish sales overseas and the government's implementation of production and sales taxes, there were no sales from March to August. In October, after it was changed to an annual business tax of 440,000 yuan, it recovered slightly. However, compared with previous years, it was only half as much. (3) Bamboo and wood are also one of the province's major export businesses, worth several million yuan annually, with Nanjing and the lower Yangtze River as the sales markets. In recent years, due to the terrible banditry in the production areas, they cannot be transported down the mountains. The Jiangnan group, which operates bamboo and wood businesses, has also seen widespread shutdowns due to traffic obstructions, financial depletion, and blocked remittances. Last year, due to the extremely tight monetary situation and high lending rates, and because those who transported bamboo and wood were often obstructed by bandits on the Gan River, resulting in delays, resulting in losses and bankruptcies were also common. (4) Gan'nan's tungsten ore is also sold to the world. In the past, each dan of tungsten sand could sell for fifty to seventy yuan. Recently, due to the global economic downturn, it only sells for more than ten yuan, and most of the mining areas are bandit-controlled areas. This export is already in dire straits. (5) Ramie cloth has declined sharply due to the impact of linen and bamboo cloth. Crude cloth, which relies on the Korean market, has been phased out since the September 18th Incident. All ramie cloth shops in Fuzhou have gone bankrupt. (6) Tea used to be a major export trade in this province. Green tea was sold to Southeast Asia, Japan, and major ports in the country, and black tea was sold to Russia. In recent years, only a small amount has been sold inside and outside the province, and exports are less than one-tenth of what they used to be. Those who started their business in this field are now in ruins. The above are the main products, and other items are even more depressed. As a result, various special products in this province cannot attract cash, and the social economy is not nourished, and the finance has completely lost its balance, becoming anemia. B. In terms of imports, foreign goods, cloth, cotton yarn, hardware, seafood, sugar, foreign paper, and kerosene are the main items. Among them, in addition to heavy industrial products from Europe and the United States, light industrial products are mostly Japanese goods. Since the vigorous implementation of anti-Japanese goods, Western goods have been more expensive and cannot meet the tastes of those who like cheap goods, and imports have gradually decreased, not as enthusiastic as before. C. Inland commerce is entirely built on the knowledgeable producers and consumers. In other words, it is entirely transferred by the prosperity of local products and the purchasing power of farmers. However, this province has been ravaged by bandits for six years, spreading to sixty counties. Natural disasters and man-made disasters have pressed each other. Local products have been declining day by day, and last year the grain price was only around two yuan, accounting for more than 80% of the province's population. Above all, the farmers have no way to survive and cannot die. How can we talk about consumption and purchasing power? The impact is that all industries are depressed, and business is naturally biological. According to a survey of the market last year, department stores were unsalable, those who operated retail stores were sparsely populated, and those who operated wholesale stores were blocked due to unrest in foreign counties, such as Ganzhou, Ji'an, Hekou, Shangmei, Pingxiang, Jingdezhen, Yuanzhou, and Xiushui. The peddling merchants have disappeared, so even if they use methods such as large price reductions, large sales, buy one get one free, and half-price discounts, they cannot attract customers. Most industries in this city are outwardly strong but inwardly weak, relying entirely on money shops to discount loans for turnover. At this moment, due to the poor market, the number of bankruptcies is increasing, such as Yudechang Money Shop and Tiancheng Fur Shop, etc., with fraudulent activities involving tens of thousands of dollars or more. The first to be affected are the money shops, so that the financial community is wary and dare not release loans. Since the money shops do not dare to release loans, the market feels more crisis-ridden. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce recently saw that the world is getting worse, and many people have gone bankrupt due to business failures, while there are also intentional frauds, obvious bankruptcies, secret escapes, and those who are free from the law. Creditors often have lawsuits for many years against debtors, and there is no solution. For example, Yulong, Meihuanji, Jinchang, and other companies have been bankrupt since last year, and creditors still have no solution to them. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday telegraphed the National Federation of Commerce of Shanghai and the Chambers of Commerce of various provinces and cities, requesting that they unanimously advocate that debt disputes be classified as administrative scope, so as to correct judicial delays and address the prevailing trend of fraud, and maintain the market. That is also out of desperation. (11th)</p>
<p>Laiyang County in Shandong Province During Military Disaster</p>
<h3>Losses Reached More Than 5.8 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: During the recent war between Han and Liu, the losses in various counties in Jiaodong were extremely heavy. The provincial government has ordered various counties to investigate the amount of losses for relief purposes. Among them, in Laiyang County, after Liu's troops retreated, the local community organized a post-disaster committee to investigate the losses suffered by the entire county due to the military disaster. It has now been investigated and reported to the county government, and the county government has forwarded it to the provincial government, requesting that it find a way to provide relief, and requesting that the next busy season's land tax and surcharges be exempted, so as to alleviate the people's difficulties. Today (10th), the provincial government's political affairs meeting discussed this case and the case of Laiyang people's request for relief. It was decided to merge it with the disaster relief case of the 199th meeting for review and unified relief. According to the investigation and report of the Laiyang County Post-Disaster Committee, the losses reached more than 5.8 million yuan, including 52 townships, 301 villages, 12,444 households, and 700,373 victims. Losses of 2,276,609 yuan. Due to the incident, farmers abandoned soybean and sweet potato fields that were not harvested, and wheat fields that were not planted, totaling 120,000 mu (a unit of land area), with an average loss of 9 yuan per mu, totaling 1.08 million yuan. In the past, the supplies provided to Liu's troops amounted to 2.03 million yuan. This time, Liu's troops were transferred, requiring 6,000 mules and large carts, at 70 yuan each, totaling 420,000 yuan. The total direct losses of the above amounted to 5,800,6609 yuan. Other indirect losses cannot be calculated. (10th)</p>

<h3>Hundreds of Farmers Demand Rent Exemption</h3>
<p>More than 300 farmers from Dongyi and Huayu townships in the fourth district of the county, led by their township chiefs, came to the city on foot at 10 p.m. the night before last, because the area was the first to be affected by the war last year, resulting in the destruction of houses, the abandonment of cultivated land, and the inability to repay the rent. They requested exemption from the 21st year's rice. The County Public Security Bureau heard the news and immediately sent police to persuade the villagers to stay temporarily in the Qunji Theatre. Meanwhile, eight representatives were sent by the villagers to the county government to petition. County Chief Zhao personally received them and informed them that the grain rent for last year had been discussed and reduced, and that the case had been determined and could not be changed. They were urged to convey the message to all villagers not to make excessive demands. The representatives then retreated respectfully.</p>

<h3>The Department Orders the Prohibition of Fisheries Tax Collection</h3>
<p>The Jiangzhe Marine Fisheries Administration previously sent Chen to Fengxian to establish a branch office to carry out the business of compiling licenses, and dispatched staff to order the payment of taxes. The Fisheries Association opposed it on the grounds that the Administration belonged to the marine scope, and at the same time, the county government also stated that it had not received provincial orders and could not comply, so it specifically requested the Department of Construction. The following instructions were received yesterday: It has been found that the coastal counties have reported to the Jiangzhe Marine Fisheries Administration that they have established offices or branch offices in various counties in the file, ordering fishermen to register, issue licenses and collect taxes. The predecessors, Tao, have successively requested the provincial government to forward the matter to the Ministry of Industry for review and approval. The circumstances of the reports are the same. Before receiving the Ministry's document, they should temporarily postpone handling in accordance with the previous instructions of the Department of Industry No. 1998 and No. 1987. In the event that the office forces fishermen to register for licenses and pay taxes, they should also be restrained to avoid disputes.</p>

<h3>Problems Arise with the Interconnection of Automobile Donation Certificates in Five Provinces and Cities</h3>
<p>The Department of Construction of Jiangsu Province, with the method of mutual payment of additional donations for automobiles in the five provinces and cities of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Beijing, and Shanghai, has been resolved by the Transportation Committee of the Five Provinces and Cities. In order to rectify the donation affairs, the Committee convened the heads of the Construction Bureaus of the relevant counties in the Department of Construction of Suzhou on the 5th of this month to discuss the implementation methods. From January 1, 22, all old licenses issued before will be replaced with new licenses. As for the license procedures, they are still the same as before. The donation certificate method must be handled in accordance with the new procedures. After receiving the order, the County Government of this county immediately transferred the order to the Construction Bureau for compliance. After receiving the order, Zicai of the Construction Bureau, because of the special circumstances of the local public buses in this county, the payment of donations and distribution has different special donations. Yesterday, he submitted three points to the county government, requesting that they be forwarded to the Department of Construction for approval. The main points he put forward are as follows: (1) The business vehicles in this county have been collecting donations and issuing licenses separately in the urban area. The Municipal Assets Management Committee collected 3 yuan and 5 jiao (a unit of currency) per vehicle, and also collected 2 jiao for cleaning. The Fourth District Office collected 3 yuan per vehicle per day. Since January 21, after this Bureau drafted the method of uniformly collecting donations and issuing licenses for business vehicles, the 119th County Government Meeting resolved to change the collection to 10 yuan per vehicle in household donations, and the cleaning donation of 2 jiao is still paid to the Municipal Assets Management Committee as usual, with 3 yuan allocated to the Fourth District Office, and the rest being county revenue. However, the repair of the roads in the urban area is the responsibility of the urban area. This time, the implementation of the new chapter, for the above-mentioned agencies, the original allocation, how will it be compensated, or will the Department allocate it according to the original amount? This is the first request for approval. (2) The three public buses in Kaiyuan Township are registered with the Fourth District Office, and in addition to paying 48 yuan per month for road repairs, 15% of the surplus is used to subsidize the repair of the road. This time, the implementation of the new chapter, can the company continue to handle the payment of donations according to the original plan, or will it collect donations and pay them to the Department for allocation? This is the second request for approval. (3) Before the unification of the monthly donations for automobiles in the Fourth District Office, it collected 7 yuan for public security funds for each license. Since the unification of donations and licenses, the above-mentioned funds are still collected by this Bureau, but the automobiles are operating poorly, and the original donation amount is already unbearable. It is considered that the collection of public security funds is harsh and requests for exemption have been made repeatedly without a proper solution. Therefore, although the business vehicles in this county have obtained uniform donation certificates, they still cannot pass through the Kaiyuan trunk road. After the implementation of the interconnection of automobiles in the five provinces and cities, how will the collection of police fees be resolved in the future, or will another amount of collection be set? This is the third request for approval. The above three points are all special circumstances in this county. This time, the implementation of the new chapter, how should it be handled? The Director of the Bureau dared not specialize, so he submitted a report to the Department for approval, and instructed to comply.</p>

<h3>Committee Member Loses Diamond Ring, Dispute</h3>
<p>Zhang Decheng, a member of the Jiangsu Department of Finance, was previously sent to Changzhou to urge the collection of deed tax and investigate the collection of business tax. After finishing his official duties, he took the Xinxia Commercial Bureau's Hu-Han liner to Yixing. After arriving at the port, the committee member reported to the Public Security Bureau that he had lost a gold and diamond ring worth 480 yuan on the ship and asked them to investigate and recover it. Director Mao Weijun immediately detained the ship and arrested the sailor Chen Dagui. Later, the Ship Bureau reported the incident to the Wujin Shipping Association, stating that the committee member had not purchased a ticket when he boarded the ship, and the ticket inspector did not know that he was a committee member of the Department of Finance, so he asked him to buy a ticket. After arriving in Yixing, the committee member suddenly reported to the Public Security Bureau that he had lost a diamond ring, which was actually a false accusation due to personal grudges. Yang Chengkan, chairman of the Shipping Association, immediately reported the situation to the provincial government by telegram. Yesterday (12th), a reply was received, stating that "I understand the contents of your telegram. Please order the Magistrate of Yixing County to investigate and handle the matter fairly and legally."</p>

<h3>Illegally Collecting Fees Under False Pretenses</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Communications' Maritime Bureau had already ordered the closure of the Ship Registration Office, which was harassing merchants and the public. Unexpectedly, a Ship Industry Workers' Union was formed in Jiangyin, with an office set up inside the Tianlun Youchang factory in Shejiaqiao.

On the 10th, three people from Taizhou, including Jiang Wengui, were carrying six or seventy loads of [character unclear]. Union officials, including Cao Zhenkun, demanded five jiao per person in fees. Later, the water police intervened and explained the situation to both parties. The case was investigated by the official, and while the union officials denied demanding illegal fees, the boatmen identified them as having done so. As a result, it was decided to send personnel to investigate and handle the matter.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Federation Urges Dispatch of Troops to Resist Japan</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special District Citizens' Federation telegraphed President Song of the Executive Yuan, as well as Brigadier He Zhuguo and Director Zhang Xueliang, urging them to dispatch troops to resist Japan and shift from defense to offense. The three telegrams are recorded below:</p>
<p>Telegram to the Executive Yuan: Respectfully to President Song of the Executive Yuan of the Nanjing National Government. The brutal Japanese are invading with all their might. Local</p>
<p>resistance will be endless. Now, national public opinion is in favor of war, and Shanghai newspapers have published articles pointing this out. We believe that unless diplomatic relations are severed, boycotting Japanese goods will be ineffective; unless mobilization occurs, resistance against Japan cannot be unified. We earnestly hope that diplomatic relations with Japan will be severed immediately, troops will be deployed to the Northeast, and the world will be informed. The League of Nations' leisurely discussions and prolonged delays will not save us from danger. At this critical juncture, we must defend ourselves with force to uphold the covenant and protect our national rights. The survival of the Party and the nation is imminent. We offer our frank advice with utmost sincerity, hoping it will be adopted. The Shanghai Citizens' Federation respectfully kowtows, true seal.</p>
<p>Telegram to He Zhuguo: Respectfully to Brigadier He Zhuguo in Tianjin. Courageous resistance against Japan, even in defeat, is glorious. Although Yuguan has been lost, its restoration is not difficult. Brigadier, your name will be recorded in history, like Cai E, for immortality. We earnestly hope that you will display your courage in repeated battles, embrace an unwavering spirit, and achieve the great task of restoring our rivers and mountains. We are ashamed of those cowardly men who offer empty words of resistance. We offer our deepest condolences via telegram. The Shanghai Citizens' Federation respectfully kowtows, true seal.</p>
<p>Telegram to Zhang Xueliang: Respectfully to Director Zhang Hanqing in Beiping. The loss of the three northeastern provinces was due to inaction. The fall of Yuguan was due to poor planning. Now, Beiping and Tianjin are in danger, and the overall situation in Rehe is dire. It is time for you to atone for your past mistakes and make amends. You should immediately lead the three armies and personally go to the front lines, shifting from defense to offense. Victory is certain. Even if not for the sake of the country, you should do it for your own sake. Strive to rise up and do not hesitate. The Shanghai Citizens' Federation respectfully kowtows, true seal.</p>
<h3>Feng Zhanhai's Representative Appeals to Support Association for Assistance</h3>
<p>Tai Feng, the representative of Feng Zhanhai stationed in Shanghai, sent a letter to the Shanghai Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association yesterday, stating, "Respectfully, we recently received a letter from our commander-in-chief, forwarded by our office in Beiping, stating that since our army arrived in Rehe, we have been deeply grateful for the various assistance provided by the patriotic gentlemen in Shanghai. All 40,000 soldiers are filled with admiration. However, since arriving in Kailu, we have been actively replenishing our forces. Although the soldiers who arrived earlier have received cotton clothing, over ten thousand who arrived later are still cold. Moreover, after more than a year of arduous fighting, they are extremely exhausted. Now, in the midst of winter, they are shivering in the wind. They are fighting for the country, disregarding their own well-being. We plan to reorganize them slightly and then lead them eastward again to engage the Japanese invaders in a desperate battle to drive out the ugly barbarians and restore our homeland. However, the Japanese bandits have now reinforced their troops and are attacking Yuguan, attempting to seize Rehe. Our army has not yet completed its replenishment and is hastily responding to the battle. On the 2nd of this month, fierce fighting broke out in the Kailu and Wangjia Youfang areas. The enemy used heavy artillery, aircraft, and infantry to suppress us, bombarding us relentlessly. After three days and nights of fierce fighting, our army refused to retreat until death. In the smoke and fog, they engaged in hand-to-hand combat. This rare and arduous battle has exhausted our incomplete replenishment supplies. We urgently hope to appeal to the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association, the Northeast Refugee Relief Association, the Recover Lost Territories Association, representatives of overseas Chinese, the Women's Relief Association, and various organizations in Shanghai to plead for assistance. At this critical moment, please do not neglect us." Feng was in the army and fought alongside them for a year, witnessing the soldiers' dedication to the country and their disregard for their own lives. After each battle, there were numerous casualties, but the morale of the soldiers did not diminish. They persevered and advanced with unwavering spirit. However, due to insufficient ammunition, they often lost the final push. Recalling the past, Feng feels heartbroken. Feng was sent south this time to appeal to all parties, and our commander-in-chief has already telegraphed your association. Now, based on the previous letter forwarded by the Beiping office, the situation is extremely urgent. We earnestly request your association to provide assistance and allocate funds as soon as possible with a patriotic fervor and send personnel to comfort them in order to encourage the soldiers and strengthen their determination to fight to the death. The reason why Li, Ding, and Ma retreated to the Russian border was due to a lack of economic resources and ammunition. The painful past is unbearable to recall. The Japanese invaders are now planning to use the troops at Yuguan to seize all of Rehe and then attack Beiping and Tianjin. The facts are clear and visible to all. According to the strength of Feng's troops, they occupy the main position in Rehe. If they are allowed to follow the same path as Li, Ding, and Ma and are annihilated without combat power, then Rehe will be lost, and there will be no hope of restoring the Northeast. The demise of the nation is imminent, and the lessons of the past are not far off. The past is terrifying. Please help the association quickly raise material and economic assistance and appeal to all sectors to maintain the unity of Feng's troops and boost the courage of the soldiers. The matter is pressing and cannot be delayed any longer. We express our utmost urgency in this letter."</p>
<h3>Relief Association Sends Condolences to General Li Du</h3>
<p>General Li Du of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Northeast Volunteer Army and his entire army were forced to retreat into the Russian territory of Turilau and Iman due to a lack of support and isolation. The various organizations of the National Salvation United Association in this city sent a telegram of condolences yesterday, stating, "Respected General Li Du and all the soldiers, as reported by various newspapers, the Northeast province has fallen to Japan. Only the Volunteer Army relies on fighting to the death. Although support has been cut off and you are temporarily retreating to Russian territory, your heroic spirit will be praised for ages. Since hearing the news, compatriots across the country have been filled with grief and indignation. We firmly believe that our great China has a vast territory and 500 million compatriots, while the brutal Japanese are merely a small island nation. We can confidently say that in the future conflict between us, only our great China can bring them to their doom. Although we are suffering temporary wounds, it will inspire our spirit. All officers and soldiers need not worry. Currently, Zhang Xueliang and He Zhuguo are leading troops in North China to fiercely fight the enemy, engaging in bloody battles over thousands of miles, repeatedly defeating the stubborn enemy, and repeatedly recovering famous cities. If they can continue the spirit of the Volunteer Army, even though you are stranded in a foreign land, you can be somewhat comforted. We hope that you will take care of yourselves and cherish your lives for the sake of the country. In addition to actively providing material and spiritual assistance, our association also hopes that the Soviet government will provide just and humanitarian assistance to the anti-imperialist fighters of our small and weak nation. In this brutal world, all revolutionary nations must join hands and work together. We express our condolences and hope you will understand. Sincerely, Shen Zurong, Chen Peide, Zhang Tianbai, Zhang Yichen, Chen Ya'fu, Wang Hanliang, and others, executive directors of the Shanghai National Salvation United Association."</p>
<p>Muslims to Hold Memorial Service for An Dexin</p>
<h3>Elite Soldier Ha Decheng, Who Died for His Country at Yuguan, Expresses His Views</h3>
<p>Battalion Commander An Dexin, a Muslim, died for his country in the Battle of Yuguan on the 7th of this month. The soldiers of his entire battalion, who had been influenced by Commander An, also died on the battlefield without a single survivor. After receiving a report from the Muslim church in Beiping, the various Muslim churches in this city expressed their deep sorrow for Commander An's sacrifice for the country and will hold a memorial service. The preparations for the memorial service have already begun. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Preparing for Memorial Service: After receiving the telegram from fellow Muslims in Beiping on the 9th, informing them of Commander An's death, the Muslim community in this city gathered at the Zhejiang Road Mosque on the 11th to discuss preparations for the memorial service. A preparatory committee was formed, with Da Fushou as the chairman, assisted by various imams. A telegram of condolence was sent to Commander An's family, and all Muslim churches around the world were notified to hold religious memorial services in their respective churches at the same time on a designated date. Replies from various places have been arriving in succession. The date will be decided at the second preparatory meeting, and memorial services will be held separately in various places at the same time.</p>
<p>Light of Islam: Yesterday, Imam Ha Decheng told a Datong News Agency reporter that Commander An was the second Muslim to sacrifice his life for the country. During the Sino-Japanese War of Jiawu, General Zuo Baogui, a Muslim, died in battle, and his deeds are recorded in national history. Now, Commander An has also died under the fire of Japanese invaders. Their loyalty, bravery, and righteousness shine brightly, reflecting each other. This is not only the honor of Zuo and An, but also the supreme glory of our Islam.</p>
<p>Generous Compensation for An: Ha continued, "Currently, members of our community are actively preparing for the memorial service to comfort An's spirit in heaven. Before his death, An was loyal and honest in his official duties, so his family is now in dire straits. Now, various churches are raising funds from members to provide generous compensation to An's family."</p>

<p>Delegates from Commercial Community of Chahar Province Arrive in Shanghai</p>
<h3>Met with Chairman of the National Federation of Commerce Yesterday, Scheduled to Take Express Train to Beijing and Return to Chahar This Morning</h3>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, in recent years, the commercial community of Chahar Province has suffered from heavy taxes imposed by the local authorities, causing a sharp decline in commerce. In addition, since the severance of relations between China and Russia, they have also been subjected to heavy taxes by the government of Kulun, placing the entire province's commerce on the verge of bankruptcy. As a last resort, they convened a meeting of the province's commercial community in December of last year to discuss relief measures, and appointed Li Yaoshan, Ren Yuheng, Cui Yunyu, Cheng Fan'an, and Wang Runting as delegates to petition various ministries and departments of the central government. Delegates Cui and Cheng arrived in Shanghai yesterday from Beijing to meet with Lin Kanghou, chairman of the National Federation of Commerce. [blank space] Expressing the association's support. It is said that the taxes collected in Chahar Province exceeded the central government's original tax amount by dozens of times, causing a complete collapse of commerce. The Ministry of Finance has promised to find ways to provide relief. Regarding commerce with Outer Mongolia, since China and Russia have formally resumed diplomatic relations, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has stated that after the exchange of ambassadors, the two countries can discuss everything. Delegates Cui and others are scheduled to take an express train back to Beijing at 9:00 AM this morning and then return to Chahar via Tianjin.</p>
<h3>The Current Situation of Japanese Goods Dumping in China Amidst Boycott</h3>
<p>Japanese Coal Sales in Shanghai Reach Over 90,000 Tons per Month</p>
<p>Japanese Cement Sales Reach Over One Million Barrels Annually</p>
<p>Fisheries Company Launches Large-Scale Aggression</p>
<p>According to the Xinsheng News Agency, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, noting the sharp increase in Japanese goods imports and their dumping throughout the Yangtze River region, averaging about 50,000 pieces per week, has reiterated the resolution passed by the members' assembly to sever economic ties with Japan and strictly prevent it. A Xinsheng News Agency reporter investigated the goods that Japan is dumping in China, and those that have the deepest impact on domestic goods are listed below:</p>
<p>Coal: Japanese coal dumping is based in Shanghai and Hankou. The policy is to use Fushun coal, transported from the Northeast to Shanghai and Hankou for dumping. Originally, Fushun coal could fetch a net price of 6.50 Japanese yen per ton in Hanyang, and even in Dalian, it could fetch 6.20 yen. However, by shipping it to Shanghai and Hankou, it only fetches a net price of 4.03 Japanese yen. The willingness to forgo heavy profits and the intention to dump are clear. They are also exploiting the weak capital of Chinese merchants by selling coal to small shops on credit. The plan is very meticulous. However, according to a survey by the Kailuan Mining Company, the sales of Kailuan No. 2 fines last year were only ten taels and seven-and-a-half qian [blank space]. However, the stockpiles in various places, including over 600,000 tons in Qinhuangdao, over 130,000 tons in Hankou, and 150,000 tons below Wuhu, totaling one million tons, are all affected by Japanese coal dumping. This is not due to the high cost of transporting domestic coal. The transportation costs for Kailuan and other types of coal, except for a few exceptions such as Shanxi coal, are calculated per ton per kilometer: Kailuan 15 yuan, Zhongxing 5 yuan, Jingxing 6 yuan, and Liuhegou 82 yuan. The transportation costs are quite reasonable. The main reason for the sluggish sales of domestic coal is still Japanese coal dumping. For example, in August of last year, the actual sales of Japanese coal in Shanghai reached 45,831 tons, and Fushun coal reached 45,582 tons, which is a staggering amount.</p>
<p>Cement: Japanese cement dumping targets various coastal ports in China, including Shanghai, Tianjin, Shantou, Xiamen, Qingdao, and Guangzhou. Along the Yangtze River, Hankou is the center. The dumping methods, in addition to price cuts, also involve directly soliciting users, such as construction factories, public works bureaus, and tram companies. The current selling price in Shanghai, including delivery, is about three taels per barrel, compared to only 24 fen in Japan. The selling price of domestic cement in Shanghai is 4.6 taels per barrel, plus consolidated tax and commission, totaling 5.35 taels per barrel, which is more expensive by over 2.3 taels. The annual production of domestic cement is about 3.7 million barrels, and the total sales in various ports across the country is about 2.7 million barrels. The remaining 1 million barrels have been seized by Japanese cement. Originally, domestic cement could be self-sufficient. Even in terms of quality, although it may not be superior to Japanese cement, there is not much difference. Only the dumping of Japanese goods has prevented it from selling well.</p>
<p>Fisheries: Japanese aggression in China's fishing industry began as early as the Meiji 28th year and is based in Qingdao, Shanghai, and Hong Kong. From 1919 to 1921, there were 34 Japanese hand-operated net fishing vessels in Shanghai, and the value of the annual fishing products encroached upon exceeded 800,000 yuan. After the Chinese government implemented fishing vessel taxes, Japanese vessels became even more cunning. After fishing illegally in our territorial waters, they would first transport the catch to Dalian and then ship it to Shanghai via Chinese merchant ships, secretly evading taxes. Last year, the Japan Fisheries Company, with a capital of 30 million yuan, organized a fisheries company in Yingkou and Dalian, launching a large-scale aggression. On June 1st of last year, Japanese fish imports amounted to 1,200 boxes, on the 2nd, 800 boxes, and on November 28th, another 697 boxes were imported, which is truly alarming. After Japanese fish reach our country, they implement a dumping policy. The selling price of fish produced in Ningbo and other places in our country is about 16 or 17 yuan per dan, while Japanese fish are sold at a reduced price of 10 to 12 yuan.</p>
<p>Russian Merchants Active in China</p>
<h3>Will Face Off with Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>According to business circles, after the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia, Russian goods are being shipped to China, with Vladivostok as the starting point for sea routes, importing to Guangzhou, Shanghai, Tianjin, Xiamen, Hankou, and other places. Land routes use Outer Mongolia as the central transportation point, transporting to Suiyuan, Zhangjiakou, and other places in North China. Timber, kerosene, woolen textiles, cotton textiles, and hardware are the main items, posing a potential head-on conflict with Japanese goods. In particular, textiles, woolens, and felt items are sufficient to deal a fatal blow to Japanese goods. The raw materials for Japanese cotton and woolen textiles still largely come from China, while Russia utilizes the latest machinery managed by the government, making the cost of production about one-third of that of Japanese goods. It is reported that Russian goods in the three northeastern provinces are already competing with Japanese merchants. Japanese goods selling for one yuan can be obtained for six jiao from Russia. It is said that the Soviet Union recently instructed its commercial personnel stationed in South China to start signing commercial contracts with major Chinese companies and stores. It is understood that in Shanghai and Hankou, eight companies, including a certain timber company and a certain cotton cloth company, have already signed such contracts with Russian merchants, and the rest are still under negotiation. Since last month, the Soviet Union has successively imported over 20,000 tons of goods, paying customs duties in accordance with customs regulations. It is reported that another 50,000 tons will be arriving in China next month. It is expected that the period of Russian merchants' activity in China will be in March, when there will be a shift in the business sector.</p>
<p>Xue Dubi Speaks</p>
<h3>Leaving Politics to Review Old Studies, Business Community Fetes Xue Yesterday</h3>
<p>Xue Dubi, member of the Central Committee and member of the National Government, recently resigned from his position as member of the National Government, stating that he will practice law in Shanghai. This newspaper's reporter interviewed Xue at his residence yesterday. According to Xue, he felt that he had made no contribution while serving in the central government and had long intended to resign. The loss of Yuguan further deepened his feelings, so he decided to resign, unwilling to occupy a position without doing any work and wasting the nation's funds. Moreover, he has studied law and has been running around for years, neglecting his studies. He is now taking the opportunity to engage in legal practice, which will allow him to review his old studies and make him very happy. He denied any political motives. When asked about the situation in Yuguan, Xue said that the government's lack of determination had created a situation of neither war nor peace, leading to the loss of the Northeast and then Jinzhou. Now that Yuguan has fallen, the gateway to North China is wide open. If the government does not make a decision and hopes that the Japanese army will be satisfied and stop, the consequences will be unimaginable.</p>
<p>Industrialists in Shanghai hosted a banquet for Xue yesterday at the Bank Club, attended by Zhao Jinqing, Cai Shengbai, Wu Yun Chu, Lao Jingxiu, Zhu Wenqi, Cheng Nianpeng, Ren Shigang, Fang Jiangge, Liu Baisen, Zhang Zilian, Hu Juewen, Xu Guangun, Zhang Huikang, and over fifty others. Chairman Xiang Kang [blank space] delivered a welcome speech, followed by Xue's explanation of his determination to leave the political arena and serve society, working hard for the industrial community to achieve the goal of national salvation through domestic goods. Wu Yun Chu then reported on his recent visit to Europe and the United States to study [blank space] chemical industry [blank space] hoping that the people of the country would strive to produce goods. Zhao Jinqing and others then delivered speeches, praising Xue's noble character and enthusiasm for service. The guests dispersed at 10:00 PM, enjoying themselves thoroughly. It is reported that Xue will begin his legal practice on the 15th.</p>
<p>Unifying Aviation Organizations</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu's Remarks, Lin Yin's and Others' Statements</h3>
<p>Since the China Aviation Association established its board of directors on New Year's Day, electing Wang Xiaolai, Wang Zhengting, Shi Liangcai, Lin Kanghou, and Lin Wojiang as standing directors, the standing directors have repeatedly left Shanghai due to official duties, and a standing committee meeting has not been held. It is now scheduled to hold the first standing committee meeting this afternoon to determine the association's address and discuss all matters to be carried out. The various news items are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Wu Tiecheng told the Central News Agency that regarding the merger of the Aviation Construction Association into the China Aviation Association, Mayor Wu Tiecheng said yesterday that the China Aviation Association was officially established on New Year's Day. The association's first task is to unify the aviation organizations. Therefore, the merger of the Aviation Construction Association has already begun. If the association refuses to merge, the central government will strictly ban this illegal organization.</p>
<p>Lin Wojiang told a Xinsheng News Agency reporter that he visited Lin Wojiang, director of the Aviation Association, and Yin Zhiling of the Aviation Construction Association to inquire about their opinions. The details are as follows: Lin said, "I have not heard of the ban. My opinion on the aviation industry is that we should encourage people to enthusiastically invest in it, rather than having the government completely monopolize it like the railways [blank space]</p>
<p>The government of course has the right to supervise and guide it, because so-called civil and commercial aircraft can be quickly converted into military aircraft. I was the first to propose the merger of the two associations, and Weng Zhaoyuan was the first to agree. Since the objectives of the two associations are the same, why should we divide into two? It is better to merge. It was later decided that each association would send three representatives to discuss the merger, but only Mr. Yin Zhiling from the Construction Association attended, so no agreement was reached."</p>
<p>Yin Zhiling said, "I have just returned to the country from the Philippines and am not very familiar with the current situation in the country. Our association has not received any official documents from the municipal government. The name of the Aviation Association was proposed by me. At a certain discussion on the merger, someone proposed to name it the China Aviation Construction National Salvation Association, but it was felt that the name of the association should not be too long, so everyone agreed to delete the words 'Construction National Salvation'. The reason why no agreement was reached at that time was that the Aviation National Salvation Association was not established at that time, only a preparatory committee. Therefore, someone from the association suggested that we wait until it is established before discussing the merger again. After the directors took office, it has been over ten days. After returning to the country, I personally asked Mr. Lin Kanghou and Mr. Shi Liangcai, and they both said that no decision has been made. Therefore, regarding the merger issue, the other party has not yet raised it, let alone agreeing to it." Yin said, "The impression I got in the Philippines was excellent. Many overseas Chinese seem to have no connection with China for a long time. Whether China [blank space] dies [blank space] or rises [blank space] seems to [blank space] be [blank space] willing [blank space] to [blank space] warmly [blank space] [character unclear] [character unclear] man [character unclear] [character unclear] China [blank space] has [character unclear] can not perish."</p>
<p>Huang Boqiao Talks About the Railway Bureau's Reforms</p>
<h3>Increase Third and Fourth Class Cars and Steam Cars, Expand the Visitor Reception System</h3>
<p>Since Director Huang Boqiao took office at the Shanghai-Nanjing and Nanjing-Shanghai Railway Administration, he has made many efforts to rectify everything internally. A Xinsheng News Agency reporter visited the director yesterday afternoon. Huang said that since he took over, there have not been many changes in the internal staff. Only the Ministry of Railways has cut the redundant positions of commissioners, and he has dismissed 15 people. In addition, he has reassigned two secretaries. The remaining specialized personnel who have served for many years [character unclear] have not</p>
<p>moved, to warm hands. As for the rumors of changes, it is likely a misunderstanding of the aforementioned dismissals. Zheng Baozhao, the director of the Traffic Department, is an expert and will definitely not be changed, so that we can jointly take responsibility for rectification. In addition, the Railway Administration has now decided to implement the following two reforms: 1. Increase the number of third and fourth class cars on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway and the number of steam cars on the Shanghai-Songjiang Railway by one train each to improve the crowded and uncomfortable conditions of the third and fourth class passenger cars in the past, while striving to pay attention to the cleanliness and hygiene of the cars to reassure passengers. 2. Expand the existing visitor reception system. The existing visitor reception system has only been available for important central figures, and the scope is too narrow. In the future, all visitor reception personnel will be required to wear uniforms and badges for identification, providing guidance on railway transportation and consultation for passengers from other places to facilitate merchants. In addition, the current scattered office locations in the bureau will be moved to a centralized location to facilitate public business. The Railway Administration staff had previously requested a year-end bonus. After he repeatedly explained the economic situation of the bureau and made the income and expenditure accounts public, the staff understood. Therefore, the strike issue has now been completely resolved.</p>
<p>In addition, the Shanghai-Nanjing and Nanjing-Shanghai Railway Administration sent a letter to this newspaper stating, "Dear Sir, we have read the news item 'Large-Scale Dismissals of Redundant Personnel in the Railway Bureau' in your newspaper, which is largely inconsistent with the facts. Most of the senior officials in the various departments of our bureau are specialized personnel and have served in the railway for many years with considerable history. Except for Sun Xuexiu, the new director of the Materials Department appointed by the Ministry of Railways, the remaining senior officials have not been changed. The personnel dismissed this time are those who were nominally employed but did not report for duty or were not loyal to their duties. The reports in today's newspapers are not accurate. We are afraid that the rumors will be confused, so we are writing to you to request that you investigate and correct the record."</p>
<p>Weng Zhaoyuan Returns to Hong Kong from the Philippines</p>
<h3>Various Parties Telegraph Mr. Weng for Assistance</h3>
<p>The Guowen News Agency reports that General Weng Zhaoyuan of the former 19th Route Army, who bravely defended Wusong, has been representing the China Aviation Construction Association. He went abroad to discuss the grand plan of saving the country through aviation with overseas Chinese. He arrived in the Philippines in early November and received unprecedented enthusiastic support from all sectors of the overseas Chinese community and the US government. More than 30 branches were established, with over 40,000 members recruited, and enough funds were raised to purchase a squadron of aircraft. Now, due to the loss of Yuguan, various parties are telegraphing Mr. Weng for assistance. It is reported that Mr. Weng left the Philippines on the 9th and arrived in Hong Kong to discuss everything with various parties. The following is a transcription of a telegram from Zhu Qinglan to the China Aviation Construction Association, forwarded to Mr. Weng: "The violent Japanese are attacking Yuguan. Our soldiers and civilians are united and determined to resist. The great battle has already begun, with the possibility of expansion and prolongation. We must strive to make preparations to serve as a backup. Where is General Weng now? The matter of aircraft is of utmost importance to the future of saving the country. It is crucial to expedite its implementation. Delay will be of no avail. Please forward this urgently and request prompt action. It would be best to organize several squadrons to return to the country to fight as soon as possible. [Signed] Zhu Qinglan."</p>
<h3>Shanghai Bar Association Prepares for the January 28th Memorial</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Bar Association, deeply mourning the anniversary of the violent Japanese invasion of Shanghai on January 28th, held a joint meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees. At the meeting, Standing Committee member Li Shirui proposed a suggestion, and it was decided to convene a special meeting of all members on the afternoon of January 28th at 2:00 PM. It was also decided to jointly hold a large-scale memorial meeting with various public organizations in the city on that day. These details have been recorded in the minutes of yesterday's Bar Association meeting. It is noted that the association has nearly a thousand members, so a large number of people are expected to attend the special meeting on that day. It has been decided to send a member of the Standing Committee to discuss the use of a venue with the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce or the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association. Once an agreement has been reached, all members will be notified, and the chief procurators of local courts will be invited to send representatives to provide guidance.</p>
<p>The National Government Presents a Plaque to Mr. Fei Wu</p>
<h3>Commemorating His Rescue of Refugees During the Shanghai Battle</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily reports that Mr. Fei Wu, the General Secretary of the YMCA, negotiated with both sides during last year's Shanghai battle to rescue refugees from Zhabei. His benevolence and chivalry are commendable. As the anniversary is approaching, the National Government has specially made a plaque inscribed with the words "Universal Love and Guidance" to commend him. It was presented to Mr. Fei by Major General Huang Gu Pan yesterday.</p>
<h3>Legislators in Shanghai Scheduled to Go to Nanjing;</h3>
<p>Wu Jingxiong Resigns from the Position of Advisor to the Public Works Department</p>
<p>The new legislative members passed by the Central Political Council who are lawyers in Shanghai are Wu Jingxiong, Sheng Zhenwei, Qu Cengze, Zhao ..., Xu Wugao, and five others. It is reported that the new legislative members will take office on the 16th, and the members in Shanghai are scheduled to take the evening train to Nanjing on the 14th. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency interviewed Dr. Wu Jingxiong at the Jing'an Law Firm and inquired about his opinion on his appointment as a legislative member. According to him, when the President of the Legislative Yuan, Sun Zhesheng, was in Shanghai, he respectfully asked him to agree to take on this position to assist him in completing the drafting of the constitution. He said that in this time of national crisis, since he could not join the military, he had to do his best to serve the government. Although life in Shanghai is more comfortable, public duty and personal feelings made it difficult to refuse. As for the position of advisor to the Public Works Department, he decided to resign and had already expressed this to the Public Works Department. However, the work of drafting the report still requires a month to complete, so his inauguration may be slightly delayed. In the future, the Jing'an Law Firm will be managed by Yu Chengxiu, Zhang Zhirang, and other colleagues, and they will continue to handle legal cases.</p>
<p>The Continental Daily reports that the newly appointed legislator Wu Jingxiong met with reporters yesterday and stated that he had decided to resign from his position as legal advisor to the Public Works Department and go to Nanjing to take office in order to serve the government. It is said that Wu's appointment as a legislator was due to the recommendation of Sun Ke, the President of the Legislative Yuan. Before going to Nanjing, Sun Ke had consulted with Wu and Wu agreed to consider it. As for his departure to Nanjing, it is said that he still needs to wait until the Public Works Department report is completed. This report is similar in nature to the Feitham Report. Because after the Feitham Report was published, Chinese residents criticized it, so Wu was asked to submit a report. It will take about another month to complete the draft. It is said that after Wu goes to Nanjing to take office, he will be engaged in drafting the Chinese constitution. With Wu's knowledge and experience, he will surely be able to complete the task happily. Therefore, after the order for his appointment as a legislator was issued, people in Shanghai were delighted that the government had found the right person.</p>
<p>Wu Dan Goes North to Join the Volunteer Army</p>
<h3>Urged by His Conscience, He Resolutely Resigns His Position</h3>
<p>Wu Dan told a reporter from the New Voice News Agency yesterday that he considered himself a young soldier. At this time of national crisis, with repeated reports from the border, if he remained in his position for a long time without going to the battlefield to serve the country, he would sweat profusely when he thought about it at midnight. Therefore, urged by his conscience and the environment, he resolutely resigned his position and went to the Northeast to do his part. At the same time, because he had served in the Northeast for many years, his former colleagues and classmates are now serving as commanders of the volunteer army, fighting hard against the enemy. He is going there to cooperate with them and jointly resist the enemy, regardless of success or failure. In terms of title, although he has received letters from various parties inviting him to take up a certain important position, his motivation this time is entirely for personal peace of mind. Therefore, he only hopes to be a soldier, holding a gun in hand, enough to defend against the enemy and protect his country. This is his ambition.</p>

<h3>Warner Company Replies to the New Pharmaceutical Association</h3>
<p>Hualunxisi Has Nothing To Do With The Company</p>
<p>The New Pharmaceutical Association sent a letter to Warner Company questioning their stance due to Hualunxisi's pro-Japanese article. This was previously reported. It is now known that the company replied to the association yesterday stating that they had nothing to do with it and denounced the article as absurd. The letter stated: "We have received your letter stating that our representative, Hualunxisi, published an article in the New York Current Affairs Monthly that supports Japan's invasion of Manchuria. We are extremely surprised to read this. Our company has always maintained friendly relations with the people of your country, and we do not sympathize with this article in any way. The said person has been dismissed by our company for more than a year. The current manager is Mr. Ge Naili. Attached is a card and an advertisement from the Continental Daily on December 6th of last year for your reference. If your association can send someone to our company to investigate, you are welcome. It is clear that the said person has nothing to do with our company. His speculative fallacies confuse the public and may have other motives. We hope you will investigate clearly."</p>

<p>China National Aviation Corporation's Bengbu Aircraft Took Off from Haizhou Yesterday</p>
<p>It Will Pass Qingdao at Noon and Arrive in Beiping Today</p>
<p>China National Aviation Corporation's Bengbu aircraft, which flies the Shanghai-Beiping route, departed from Shanghai the day before yesterday. However, due to poor weather conditions en route, it was inconvenient to fly and landed at Haizhou Airport. It took off from Haizhou again yesterday morning and arrived in Qingdao at 12:10 PM.

<h3>Notice Regarding Postal Workers' Relief Funds</h3>

Because the remaining funds in the union's public relief fund are sufficient to pay for the public relief of two people, each member only needs to pay 30 cents of silver for the public relief fund this month. In addition to the deduction by the Postal Administration of the Directorate General of Posts and the Accounting Office of the Supply Division, this notice is hereby issued for your information."</p>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs Instructs Companies to Register According to Law</p>
<h3>Must Complete Registration Before June 30th, Otherwise Penalties Will Be Imposed According to Law</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce issued a notice to various trade associations yesterday, relaying the instruction No. 7365 from the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs: "The Ministry of Industry's instruction No. 15461 states that Article 18 of the General Rules for Merchants stipulates that businesses should not use the word "company" or similar words in their names unless they operate in accordance with company regulations. This also applies to those who inherit the business of a company but do not continue to operate it in accordance with company regulations. Furthermore, a company may not be established until it has been registered with the competent authorities in the location of its headquarters. Article 114 of the same law states that a company may not issue shares until it has been registered. Article 231, Section 1 and Section 6 of the same law stipulate penalties for those who fail to apply for registration according to law or who illegally issue shares. Therefore, a company may not be established and may not issue shares unless it is organized and registered according to law. Recently, it has been found that some merchants in various provinces and cities are operating businesses or are not organized as companies but are falsely using the name of a company, or are organized as a company but have not applied for registration. They should be banned according to law. Furthermore, companies that have not been registered as legal entities have not obtained qualifications, and their types of organization have not been determined. They often claim to be limited liability companies, but because they have not been registered, they must bear unlimited liability to the outside world. It is clear that they started operating before they were registered, and because they have not been registered, they cannot prevent others from imitating their brands. The company itself suffers greatly. The responsibilities of directors and supervisors are even more important. If the registration is delayed due to unclear procedures or inconvenient transportation, it may be excusable in terms of sentiment, but it is still not in accordance with the law. Therefore, it is hereby reiterated that all companies established in the future should apply for registration within the time limit stipulated in Article 5 of the Company Law. Companies that have already been established but have not yet applied for registration must apply for registration in accordance with the law before June 30th, 1933. If they fail to comply by the deadline, they will be punished according to law once they are discovered. Furthermore, Article 31 of the Implementing Rules of the Company Law stipulates that the registration certificate of a company shall be issued by the Ministry of Industry after registration. Article 5 of the Company Registration Rules stipulates that company registration is only confirmed after the Ministry of Industry issues a license. Therefore, in terms of procedure, the registration of a company must be finally approved and licensed by the Ministry before it can be considered confirmed and have legal effect. In addition to distributing and publishing a notice in the newspaper, the bureau is hereby ordered to provide practical guidance and strictly inspect and, after receiving the order, immediately issue a public notice so that all companies will apply to the bureau for registration and transfer to the Ministry for registration within the specified time limit to avoid penalties and respect the law. Be sure to comply with this order."</p>
<h3>The County Government Finds It Difficult to Raise Funds for Relief Bonds for the War Zone</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government previously received instructions from the province and county to raise Jiangsu relief bonds for the war zone. The Director of the Finance Bureau, Wang, went to the province to collect the bonds. Because the war zone needs funds urgently, in addition to the provincial departments urging collection, Commissioner Li Yi was sent to the county government the day before yesterday to supervise and urge collection. After meeting with County Magistrate Yan, it was found that the county has become a poor area since it was divided with the municipal government. In addition, it was affected by last year's Shanghai battle, so people's livelihoods are declining. Most farmers are self-cultivating their own fields and there are no large landowners. Now is the time to collect the winter tax, so even if they solicit donations, it would be in vain. Therefore, after consulting with the provincial commissioner, Yan decided to wait until the winter tax collection is over before the Finance Bureau makes efforts to solicit donations. The commissioner has already returned to the province to report.</p>

<h3>Achievements of the Jinpu Railway in Responsible Transportation Last Month</h3>
<p>丨In fact, the revenue increased by more than 470,000 yuan compared with the same month of the previous year丨</p>
<p>News from the transportation industry: the railway is responsible for transportation, and the first to prepare for implementation is the Jinpu Railway. The stations south of Xuzhou on the railway began to implement it on September 1st of last year. On November 1st, all stations, large and small, north and south of the railway, implemented responsible transportation for both carload and less-than-carload shipments. The monthly freight revenue settlement was compared with the revenue of the same month of the previous year, and it was found that the revenue had increased by more than 542,000 yuan, which has been reported in the newspaper and has been highly valued by the authorities.</p>
<p>The preliminary results have now been settled. The settlement for the first ten days of the month shows an increase of 114,654.80 yuan compared with the revenue for the same month of the previous year, an increase of 275,846.73 yuan for the middle ten days, and a decrease of 165,470.07 yuan for the last ten days. Therefore, the final freight revenue for the month increased by only 225,030.09 yuan compared with the revenue for the same month of the previous year. At first glance, it seems to be less than the previous month, but the end of December is the time for year-end settlement and collection. As a result, the revenue on the books is only this amount. Furthermore, the various armies along the railway were very busy with troop deployments during that month, and the transportation of military rations and equipment totaled more than 100 military trains. This is also a major reason for the decrease in freight transportation. Without the above two conditions, plus the estimated business volume of more than 84,000 yuan in the last ten days, the actual increase in freight revenue compared with the same month of the previous year would be more than 473,500 yuan.</p>
<h3>Repercussions of the Shazhou Land Price Limit Compensation</h3>
<p>Business owners Lu Fenghan and others oppose the illegal disposition of the Shangbao Shazhou Official Property Bureau. Yesterday, they submitted a document to the mayor, stating, "Regarding the Shangbao Shazhou Official Property Bureau causing hardship to the people and dereliction of duty through illegal disposition, we earnestly request your review and approval and swift consultation with the Jiangsu Provincial Government's Department of Finance to order a halt to these actions, in order to prevent disturbances and maintain property rights. We, the petitioners, in accordance with the Ministry regulations in the twelfth year of the Republic, registered for and received the Shazhou land in the twenty-seventh section of Gaoqiao, totaling 62.5 mu each for Ziyun and Songmei, and 37.5 mu each for Jiansun and Mingjia, bearing grain taxes and fulfilling obligations for many years. The procedures were complete, and we lived in peace for a long time. Unexpectedly, last winter, we suddenly received an order from the Shangbao Shazhou Official Property Bureau, setting a deadline to pay the land price compensation. Subsequently, they forcibly halved the disposition. We, the petitioners, were extremely shocked upon hearing this. Considering the matter to be bizarre and unclear, we went to the bureau to inquire about the details, asking about the legal basis and the reasons for this action. Unexpectedly, the bureau acted arrogantly and arbitrarily, claiming that if we were asked to pay, we should just pay, and there was no need to discuss any reasons. In this situation, we, the petitioners, were at a loss, unsure of what to do. Just as we were about to file for relief, we received a notice from your office's Land Bureau, stating that the Shangbao Shazhou Official Property Bureau's official letter mentioned that Lu Ziyun and others originally received more than 190 mu of beach land in the twenty-seventh section, and due to unpaid land prices, a halved disposition was to be made. It requested that the four beach land certificates of the said landholders be sent over for verification, in order to issue certificates for half of the land. Upon receiving this notice, we checked the case. It concerns the integrity of the land under your jurisdiction and has already been reviewed and rejected by the Land Bureau. We dare to present to your Excellency the complete procedures for registering for the Shazhou land in accordance with the Ministry's regulations, as well as the bureau's illegal disposition, in detail: 1. Article 10 of the 'Regulations for the Clearance of Jiangsu Shazhou Land' promulgated by the Ministry stipulates that the value of Shazhou land is divided into two categories: 1. Land that has already been enclosed and cultivated: (a) Top-grade Shazhou land: 10 yuan per mu; (b) Medium-grade Shazhou land: 8 yuan per mu; (c) Lower-grade Shazhou land: 6 yuan per mu. All of the above must be paid in full at once. 2. Land that has not yet been enclosed and cultivated: (a) Top-grade grassy beach: 5 yuan per mu; (b) Medium-grade grassy beach: 4 yuan per mu; (c) Lower-grade grassy beach: 3 yuan per mu. After future enclosure and cultivation, the original price will still be charged in full at once. Those who have already paid 5 yuan will pay another 5 yuan, those who have already paid 4 yuan will pay another 4 yuan, and those who have already paid 3 yuan will pay another 3 yuan. The total amount paid in two installments will be the same as the amount paid for cultivated land, and no further price will be collected thereafter. The Shazhou land paid by us, the petitioners, was in accordance with the third item of the first category of the said article, paying 6 yuan per mu for lower-grade Shazhou land in one lump sum. There is no need to pay any additional compensation, which is very clear. According to the law, there is no obligation to pay any additional compensation. Now, the bureau is arbitrarily and recklessly extorting money and forcibly imposing a halved disposition, which is a disregard for the Ministry's regulations and the credibility of the nation, and is absurd and illegal. It is difficult to remain silent. This is our first request to forward this to the Ministry to order a halt to these actions. 2. Even if we take a step back and consider that there may be changes to the aforementioned regulations after the price was paid in accordance with the Ministry's promulgated regulations, according to the legal principle that laws should not be applied retroactively, these changes cannot have any binding effect on us, the petitioners, especially if the legal regulations have never been changed. If the Ministry's regulations stipulate that no further payment is required, but the bureau suddenly orders additional payment and forcibly imposes a halved disposition under the pretext of adjusting the bureau's accounts, treating the people as meat on a chopping board and using Shazhou land as a tool for fraud, it is no different from guiding the people to play with the law. The nation's credibility is completely trampled upon by the bureau, and the people suffer endlessly. The impact will be that people</p>
<p>will not dare to inquire about Shazhou official property, hindering the nation's Shazhou land revenue significantly. This is our second request to forward this to the Ministry to order a halt to these actions. 3. The Shazhou land registered by us, the petitioners, has all been enclosed as lower-grade Shazhou land. We immediately requested the Baoshan County Government to conduct a survey and measurement, completing the procedures. Furthermore, on March 2, 1928, in accordance with the Shazhou Land Clearance Bureau's announcement, we submitted four copies of the Ministry's certificates and four sets of registration documents to the bureau for verification. The bureau verified that the land price had been paid in full in accordance with the Ministry's regulations, and stamped the Ministry's certificates with the Shazhou Land Clearance Bureau's registration seal, marking them with the words "Registered in the Ri (Day) character Shazhou Land Book." We also submitted to your office's Land Bureau an announcement, submitting all the evidence and requesting the issuance of land certificates. The procedures were complete, and the property rights are certain. Now, the Shangbao Shazhou Official Property Bureau, without asking whether the land price has been paid in full or verifying the case files, rashly orders additional payment and illegally imposes a disposition, which is a disregard for the Ministry's regulations and an abuse of power. This is our third request to forward this to the Ministry to order a halt to these actions. 4. Gaoqiao is located in the Shanghai city area and should be under the jurisdiction of your office's Land Bureau according to the law. Others should not overstep their bounds. The integrity of the land is especially a plan already established by your office's Land Bureau. Therefore, those Shazhou official properties that have not yet had their grain taxes increased are given a deadline to pay 40% of the increased assessment fee for cultivated land. Those that have already had their grain taxes increased are notified to exchange their land certificates to secure their property rights. This has been followed consistently, and the people are happy to comply. Now, the Shangbao Shazhou Official Property Bureau is not handling matters in accordance with the law, but is abusing its power to extort money. It seems that the 40% cultivated land compensation fee stipulated by your office's Land Bureau for those that have not yet had their grain taxes increased is met with suspicion and hesitation, hindering its implementation. This not only oppresses the common people but also hinders the integrity of the land under your jurisdiction. This is our fourth request to forward this to the Ministry to order a halt to these actions. Based on the above reasons, according to administrative procedures, we should submit this to the Jiangsu Provincial Government's Department of Finance to order a halt to these actions. However, we fear that the Department of Finance may be deceived by the bureau, making it difficult to achieve the desired effect. Furthermore, Gaoqiao is under your jurisdiction, and if the bureau is allowed to act arbitrarily, it will have a significant impact on the integrity of the land. Therefore, we request your review and swift consultation for the sake of benefit and convenience. Respectfully submitted to Wu, the Mayor of Shanghai City, by petitioners Lu Ziyun, son Fenghan, Fengbo, Lu Meisong, Jian, and Sun Mingjia."</p>

<h3>Road Construction Association Advocates for Automobile Consumer Cooperative</h3>
<p>Preparations will begin after approval by the Executive Committee soon</p>
<p>Many Fujian and Guangdong business tycoons and overseas Chinese are willing to invest</p>
<p>The China National Road Construction Association, in order to prevent the monopoly and exploitation of automobile consumption and to gradually reduce waste, plans to jointly establish an automobile consumer cooperative with various long-distance automobile companies in the country and all or some automobile owners. This cooperative will specialize in collecting statistics on the quantity and types of automobiles and their required items nationwide, and will negotiate with manufacturers at home and abroad for the lowest wholesale prices, with the aim of achieving transparency, fairness, quality, and affordability. It will also encourage domestic factories to imitate the production of various automobile parts needed, and all users will give priority to purchasing from them, in order to promote production and reclaim profit rights. Currently, the association is drafting the "China Automobile Consumer Cooperative" proposal, which will be submitted to the Executive Committee for approval soon. Afterwards, it will notify all directors to begin preparations and actively implement the plan. It is reported that many Fujian and Guangdong business tycoons and overseas Chinese support the plan and are willing to invest in the establishment of this enterprise. Long-distance automobile companies and highway bureaus in various provinces are particularly hoping that this will become a reality soon, in order to avoid the various difficulties in purchasing parts and the resulting losses.</p>

<p>Snowflakes danced all day yesterday</p>
<h3>The Severe Cold in the North, the Righteous Army Fights the Enemy, People in Shanghai Should Also Feel Sympathy</h3>
<p>Since the evening of the 11th in this city, it has been snowing for two days without stopping. However, the snow is not very heavy, and the accumulation on the roofs is only about an inch. As for the roads, carts are running horizontally and vertically, and people are coming and going. The snow melts as it falls, only feeling it is hard and slippery, making it difficult to stand. Yesterday morning, the snow was heavier, with goose feather-like flakes fluttering in the wind. At other times, it was like salt scattered from the sky, with snowflakes dancing in competition. Since the two days of snowfall in Shanghai, the bustling city has suddenly turned into a silver world, covered in powder and jade, with a different kind of scenery. At this time, the severe cold in the north, the righteous army fights the enemy, living in a world of ice and snow every day. The people of Shanghai, accustomed to urban life, should also be moved by this, right? Yesterday's temperature was lower than the previous two days. There were cases of poor people freezing to death in the alleys. Moreover, the supply of vegetables in the various vegetable markets was quite scarce, and the prices also increased accordingly. The situation yesterday is recorded below:</p>
<p>Frozen to Death Paupers: Continuous auspicious snow has been falling for three days without stopping, and the temperature has dropped to zero. Therefore, poor people rushing on the roads often freeze to death due to their low resistance. The night before last, a male corpse was found collapsed on the ground in the south of Sanguantang, Tangqiao, Pudong. He was about forty years old, wearing a black cotton jacket and trousers, and a peaked cap. No family members reported the case. The local security officer Zhu Zhangsheng reported to the local court for inspection. In addition, an unidentified man was also found collapsed in a pit latrine in Yu's Family Temple, Pudong. He was about fifty years old, wearing a black cotton jacket, a blue cloth shirt, and single trousers, with black leggings as a skirt and bare feet. There were no family members. The local security officer Yang Baobao reported for investigation. Chief Prosecutor Yang et al. went to verify and confirmed it was death by freezing. They instructed the hall to collect the bodies for burial.</p>
<p>Vegetable Prices Rise: Yesterday, in various small vegetable markets in the city, except for meat which was sold as usual, the fish and shrimp were all frozen. The vendors considered them rare goods and doubled the prices. However, due to the inability of returning hometown vendors and farmers to quickly transport vegetables to Shanghai, the prices of various vegetables rose sharply.</p>
<p>Rickshaw Pullers' Misery: Yesterday, the business of stores along various roads in the city was relatively slow compared to the past. Due to the wind and snow, there were few pedestrians. The rickshaw pullers on the road were shivering, extremely miserable. Most passengers took trams to avoid the wind and snow.</p>
<h3>A Short-Sighted Policeman Inspects a Gun Barrel, A Bullet Misfires and Kills Him</h3>
<p>Mei Chunzhi, a policeman from the First District Police Station of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, was twenty-six years old and from Tiantai County, Zhejiang Province. After finishing his shift at four o'clock in the afternoon the day before yesterday, he was cleaning his pistol after returning to the station in the morning. Unexpectedly, there was a bullet inside, which he forgot to remove. Because Mei was short-sighted in one eye, he looked into the barrel, and the bullet misfired, hitting Mei's forehead, penetrating his brain, and causing him to fall to the ground. Blood and brains mixed together. The district chief learned of this and immediately sent him to Shanghai Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective, and he died that night. Yesterday, the district ordered Lu Rongde, the head of the Sixteen Puling, to report to the local court for inspection. In the afternoon, Chief Prosecutor Yang et al. arrived at the court, verified that it was death by gunshot wound, and the family members collected the body for burial pending verification.</p>
<h3>The Wusong Ship Tea Attendants Are Employed by the Company</h3>
<p>Regarding the Wusong ship tea attendants, the manager of Taikoo Company told people that in the past, passengers were often treated poorly by the tea attendants and were very dissatisfied. They had repeatedly reported to the company that these tea attendants were not directly employed by the company and did not receive wages. They could only demand tips to make a living. In view of this, the company, in order to ensure the peace of mind of travelers, specially employed the Wusong ship tea attendants themselves, gave them good salaries, and entrusted them with maintaining order, so that they would not make excessive demands on passengers. The company did not sign a contract with any party to retain the tea attendants on each ship.</p>
<h3>Pushan Villa's Report on Charitable Deeds in the 21st Year</h3>
<p>Pushan Villa has been handling the burial of the exposed remains for years, which is of great importance to public health. Since the Shanghai Incident, it has buried the fallen soldiers and victims in the war zones of Jiangwan and Dachang, which is especially numerous. According to statistics, the total number of coffins buried throughout the year is no less than 36,000, which is a record number of burials in the history of the villa. The number of deaths is extremely tragic. The villa's report on the annual charitable deeds is detailed below: (1) Burial Section: Zhabei Villa buried 1,359 large coffins and 15,068 small coffins from Zhabei, Jiangwan, and the war zone.

<h3>A Tragedy Occurs in the Kitchen of Nanyang Model Middle School</h3>
<p>| The Cook Died a Tragic Death |</p>
<p>Chen Genfu, the cook of the private Model Middle School in Shanghai Jiaotong University on Haige Road in West Shanghai, has been contracting the school's meals since 1926, employing twelve people. He lived outside the school at No. 3 Hujiazhai. In the evening, the kitchen affairs were handled by Tao Shengbao (over thirty years old), a fellow villager who specialized in chopping, Chen Jinyong's younger brothers and Tao's introducer Gao Jingwu, who lived together in the school kitchen for three years. Tao Shengbao was honest, had no hobbies, and was trusted by Chen Genfu, the head cook. Unexpectedly, at about 4:00 a.m. yesterday, Chen Caiyun went to the stove in the kitchen with a candle to prepare to cook rice porridge. He suddenly saw Tao Shengbao's body lying horizontally on a pile of wood chips at the stove door. His chest was exposed, his abdomen was bloody, his large intestine was dragged out, and there was blood on the knife wound on his throat. A kitchen knife was left next to the deceased's right knee, and the lower body trousers were pulled down, with the belt untied. Chen immediately reported the situation to Song Baoqing, the police captain of Jiaotong University, who reported it to the Second Sub-Bureau of the Sixth District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau. The patrolman Shi Jintian was dispatched to investigate the school's kitchen and took Gao Jingwu and the other two roommates to the bureau for questioning.

<h3>Record of Interrogation of Kidnappers in the Sun Yangru Case</h3>
<p>Kidnappers Each Had Specific Responsibilities</p>
<p>Confessions Involved Mutual Blame</p>
<p>Sun Yangru, a native of Anhui, 47 years old, was the manager of Tongfeng Company at No. 5 Nianji Road. At 4 p.m. on the 14th of last month, Sun drove his own car, No. 2648, to No. 67 Xieqiao Road to visit a friend. When the car passed the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Xieqiao Road, it was suddenly blocked by three kidnappers. Each held a pistol and jumped into the car. Two of the kidnappers, armed with guns, watched over Sun, while the third kidnapper drove the car in Sun's place, heading straight to Fuli Road, Avenue Petain, in the French Concession. There, they switched to another car, No. 6335, which the kidnappers had pre-parked at the location, and drove to No. 5 Yideli, Raoul Road, where they hid Sun. They then sent a letter to Sun's family, demanding a huge ransom. Sun's family, fearing harm to Sun, concealed the matter from the police. It was not until the morning of the 27th that Lu Liankui, Chief Inspector of the Detective Division of the Central Police Station, learned that some bandits were hiding in Room 414 of the East Asia Hotel on Nanjing Road. He immediately led Chinese detectives Liu Shaokui, Feng Zhiming, Shao Jingfan, and Dong Zhaobin to the hotel and arrested Huang Jingtang. Subsequently, in Room 343 of the Huizhong Hotel, Yang Baofu, Tang Jinsheng (aka Xu Hairong), Ma Lisan, Gao Shanqing, and others were arrested. They confessed to being involved in the Sun case and revealed the location where Sun was being held. Lu then led Chinese detectives Zhou Honglin, Wang Guilin, Shen Tianbao, Xie Futang, Bao Lisheng, and other Chinese and foreign detectives to Raoul Road, where they safely rescued Sun Yangru. At the time, there was a struggle with the bandits, resulting in two bandits, Lu Ge and Wang Yaohua, being injured. Lu later died from his injuries. Two pistols and more than thirty rounds of ammunition were seized. Arrests of accomplices continued, resulting in the capture of a total of twenty-two male and female bandits. A car, No. 6335, used in the kidnapping, and Huang Jingtang's car, No. 11624, were seized. The case was handed over to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. After investigation, seven people, including Wang Ziang, were found to be innocent and released. The remaining fifteen, including Yang Baofu, Tang Jinsheng, Ma Lisan, Gao Shanqing, Wang Weichuan, Wu Anwen, Wang Yaohua, Guo Yusheng, Wang Chunshan, Jia Jingshan, Huang Jingtang, Li Xitang, Chen Jushuo, Wu Wangshi, and Wang Dingshi, were identified as follows: Yang Baofu and Huang Jingtang were the leaders of the case; Tang Jinsheng and Ma Lisan were responsible for hiding Sun; Gao Shanqing purchased the car; Wu Anwen drove the car; Wang Yaohua carried out the kidnapping; Guo Yusheng and Wang Chunshan were responsible for guarding Sun; Jia Jingshan was in charge of contact; Wang Weichuan was the gatekeeper; and the others were accomplices in the case. Yesterday afternoon, Qian Hongtang, Presiding Judge of the Criminal Division of the First Special Court, continued the trial in the first criminal court. The police lawyer, Ru Baoyi, explained the circumstances of the case and stated that two seals with Ma Lisan's alias, Yuan Jinxiang, were found in the bandit's lair. After Sun was kidnapped, a diary was taken by the bandits, with the English phrase "Please remember December 14th" written in it. All the seized items were presented to the court. When questioned, Tang Jinsheng and Yang Baofu confessed that they, Wang Yaohua, and others had discussed the kidnapping at the East Asia Hotel. Later, Yang obtained 100 yuan from Huang Jingtang, and Xue Dexing (who is at large) rented a house. Ma Lisan, Guo Yusheng, Lu Ge, and Wang Weichuan lived inside. Car No. 6335 was purchased by Gao Shanqing for 800 yuan. Wang Weichuan confessed to being responsible for cooking and buying food. Wu Wangshi confessed that she was hired by Xue as a servant and was not allowed to go upstairs, so she knew nothing about the kidnapping. Wu Anwen confessed that Xue asked him to drive car No. 6335 and on December 14th, ordered him to pick up a guest on Fuli Road, but he did not know it was a kidnapping. Guo Yusheng confessed that Tang Jinsheng asked him to guard Sun, and he guarded him for more than ten days. Huang Jingtang confessed that when Wen Yingxing was the head of the Public Safety Bureau, he served as the captain of the police force and handled many major cases, which made him hated by bandits, so he is now being falsely accused and did not participate in the case. Chen Jushuo confessed that he founded a charitable organization in Jiangdu and is currently the director of the Jiangdu Poor Children's Home, earning 3,000 yuan a year. He asked why he would commit such a criminal act. The other defendants gave evasive confessions. Chen Jushuo and others hired lawyers E Sen and Fan Gang to defend them. Judge Qian reviewed the confessions and, as the case still required investigation, adjourned the trial for one week. Li Xitang was released on bail of 1,000 yuan. Wu Wangshi and Wang Dingshi were released on bail to be available for questioning at any time.</p>

<p>Let's All "Do"</p>
<p>丨Letter from Mu Jun丨</p>
<p>I read the letter from Zhang Yuanjun in the January 10th issue of this column, and I felt immensely refreshed by his discussion of the questions raised by Gao Mianzhi (Why is education not doing well? Why don't farmers have enough to eat?), like chewing a snow pear! It's so much better than vaguely talking about "the whole social problem." Alas! Millions upon millions of oppressed people only know how to "endure hardship," even more than cattle and horses, eating "tree bark and grass roots" until they die! "Inexplicable"! This is how the masses live, and this is how the status quo is sustained! But will it last? It looks like it's about to collapse! Zhang Jun said: "Now we can only clench our fists and stand up and do!" Really, now we should all stand up and "do" this "collapse"! Friends! Let's all "do"!</p>
<h3>Which Way Should We Go?</h3>
<p>丨Letter from Qian Xingnong丨</p>
<p>Reading this column these days, we can hear many painful cries erupting from under heavy oppression. These cries are truly from the masses! We believe that as long as someone is a youth of the times, they should know what changes their current society will undergo. Unexpectedly, in the December 30th issue of this column, I found a letter from Zhang Conglong, who advocated that this column should publish more letters about studying natural science and starting businesses to solicit like-minded people, and should not just let unemployed people complain and heartbroken people show off. I really don't know if he is talking in his sleep or awake! Originally, what we have here is a bloody atmosphere. A rich young master jumping out of a car must find it annoying to hear beggars begging for food. Zhang finds this column "tasteless," which is exactly the same! It's just a pity that Zhang's footing is not very stable. Look, he's about to fall! At that time, we'll see if Zhang wants to make any "complaints" or shout a few "slogans"! Here, which way should we go? Wake up, Zhang! Otherwise, we can only watch you follow the old decline and decline quickly!</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Regarding the errors in Zhang Conglong's letter, we have already made some corrections in our previous reply (see December 30th issue). Now we have received another letter from Qian, which, although it does not contain any new insights, is still worth referencing, so we have recorded and published it here.</p>
<h3>True "Charity"</h3>
<p>丨Letter from a Drifter丨</p>
<p>Reading the letter from Ms. Zhao Jinglan (Poor Family and Heavy Burden) published in the December 29th issue of this column, we are filled with infinite emotion.</p>
<p>I feel that Zhao's family is in an extremely dangerous situation. Anyone with a bit of passion should express sympathy after reading her letter.</p>
<p>Being a person, especially in our Chinese society, whether as an individual or a family, if you don't plan ahead and be careful every step of the way, when you encounter a situation where you have nowhere to turn for help, society will absolutely not forgive or help you. It's already extremely lucky if they don't say you're "suffering the consequences of your own actions."</p>
<p>I always believe that people should help each other, but what kind of world is this now? If you want to find a truly enthusiastic charitable person who specializes in helping those with nowhere to turn for help, I'm afraid you can't find one in ten thousand people.</p>
<p>I also come from a difficult and impoverished background, so I am always willing to help those in need as much as I can. Unfortunately, my power is too weak and my financial resources are too limited. Otherwise, I would really be willing to help Zhao, and I sincerely hope that like-minded comrades can unite and come up with a way to help them so that her family can continue to survive. This is a great deed, and saving people is also saving oneself. Cultivating talents for the country is also an act of patriotism. Finally, I can only comfort Ms. Zhao with the saying "Heaven never bars all roads".</p>
<p>Reply: The letter expresses deep sympathy for the suffering of Zhao's family and a willingness to "help others in need" with personal strength, and further hopes that everyone can unite to help Zhao. Such concern shows the kindness of your heart, which fills us with infinite respect! However, there is one point that you should pay attention to: Will our temporary help to Zhao enable her to escape her bitter situation forever? Even if it can, there are countless others like Zhao in today's society, and many are about to starve to death. According to your relief method, can we help them all escape their bitter situation one by one? Of course not. Then, we can only save Zhao alone, what about the others? Therefore, the current problem cannot be solved by "charity". We must change the way things are so that everyone can be saved. This is an ironclad fact! Even the "mutual aid" you mentioned must have meaning under certain conditions. Under the current deformed organization, it is impossible to talk about. But please don't misunderstand, we are not preventing people from doing "charity". We hope that everyone can do a broader and greater "charity" that can save everyone. Only this kind of "charitable fact" that can save everyone is "true" "charity". This is what we should tell you.</p>
<p>Sun Ruchang, please note: Your views are excellent, but they are not suitable for publication. Please provide your mailing address so that we can discuss them in a letter. We look forward to hearing from you!</p>

<h3>The French Municipal Council's Indication on Subsidies for Private Schools</h3>
<p>Individual Requests Should Be Given Special Consideration</p>
<p>The Private School Federation Still Needs to Continue its Efforts</p>
<p>Regarding the case of the Shanghai French Concession Private Primary and Secondary School Federation requesting subsidies from the French Municipal Council for private schools within the concession, the French Municipal Council issued a notice yesterday, clearly stating that the Private School Federation believes there has been no result and still needs to continue its efforts. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Municipal Council Notice: The French Municipal Council issues the following notice: This council recently received a letter from the French Concession Private Primary and Secondary School Federation requesting subsidies. This council has always attached importance to public education, and the issue of moral education is of particular concern to the French Concession authorities. Therefore, this council has not only allocated substantial funds to establish various Chinese children's schools, but also subsidized significant amounts to various Chinese educational institutions within the concession in the form of grants or tax exemptions. Furthermore, in 1931, a new Chinese children's school was established, with establishment costs reaching 300,000 yuan, and annual operating expenses reaching 22,222 taels of silver, all borne by this council's budget, which is clear evidence of this council's greatest efforts. This council will certainly give special and fair consideration to individual private schools that come to request subsidies. This notice is hereby issued.</p>
<p>The Private School Federation's Statement: According to Mr. Ma Jia, a standing committee member of the federation, speaking to a Shanghai News reporter yesterday, after the Municipal Government and the Municipal Bureau of Education agreed to be responsible for contacting the French Consul-General for negotiations regarding the federation's subsidy request, it immediately complied with the order to temporarily suspend its efforts and await the outcome. This notice from the French Municipal Council, although a public announcement, has not been formally received by the federation. The federation does not consider it a reply, and the expressions within the notice cannot be considered a result. Therefore, the private schools within the concession are awaiting the outcome and holding examinations, which has delayed this matter. It has now been decided to convene a general meeting in the shortest possible time to jointly discuss how to proceed, and it is planned to expand the movement.</p>
<h3>The County Bureau of Education Prepares to Relocate</h3>
<p>Sorting Documents and Papers for Days</p>
<p>Relocation to be Implemented by the End of the Month</p>
<p>In Shanghai County, in addition to the Bureau of Construction and the Public Security Section, which have already relocated, other agencies have not yet begun to move. It is now learned that the County Bureau of Education began yesterday to sort out stationery, files, instruments, etc., and assign numbers in preparation for relocation. According to Mr. Yang, the secretary of the bureau, the exact date of relocation has not yet been determined, but the relocation will definitely take place by the end of this month.</p>
<h3>St. John's Alumni Association Annual Meeting and Dinner</h3>

<p>The Shanghai branch of the St. John's University Alumni Association of the Continental Commercial Venue will hold its annual meeting and dinner tonight at 7 PM on the ninth floor of the YMCA in Ba Xian Qiao.

The university's senior student music class will perform Western music. It is reported that the association has received more than 200 registrations from alumni. It is hoped that alumni who have not received an invitation card will quickly attend and participate in the grand event.</p>
<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Boy Scout Military Band to Broadcast Tonight</h3>
<p>The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce Boy Scout Corps' military band has received much praise from guests at the New World. The band's instruments are all ancient Chinese military instruments, with more than 60 instruments in the entire band. Since training, the results have been impressive. On the 3rd of this month, at the request of the American Fox Film Company, the band filmed a scene with sound called "Campfire," and the military band also joined in the performance, which amazed foreigners. They believed that the Chinese band was far superior to Western music. Tonight at 8 PM, the band will broadcast on the Zhongxi Pharmacy broadcasting station.</p>
<h3>He Yangxian to Speak on Family Economics</h3>

<p>The 11th academic lecture at the Municipal Public Education Hall has been scheduled for Mr. He Yangxing, a master's degree holder and assistant manager of the Xinhua Bank, to speak on the topic of "Family Economics." The date is set for January 15th. Those who wish to attend must obtain tickets in advance.</p>

<h3>The Sixth District Education Association Organizes a Meeting</h3>
<p>Since the Sixth District Education Association of Water City began reorganizing and registering new and old members in accordance with orders, more than 100 people have registered. The association held its second reorganization meeting in the meeting room of the Municipal Bureau of Education. The reorganizers, Zhou Shang, Xi Feijian, Feng Yixian, Jin Xizhang, and Jiang Manqian, made the following resolutions: (1) The general meeting has been changed to the afternoon of March 1st at the Hua Yu Lu De Xin Elementary School because the schools are currently in the closing period. (2) Feng Yixian, Zhou Shang, and Jin Xizhang were appointed to review the qualifications of registered members. (3) The subsidy from the Municipal Education Association is only five yuan, which is insufficient. A letter should be sent to request an increase. (4) Before the general meeting is held, new and old members can still register at the association at 587 Qiujiang Road at any time. (5) The third reorganization meeting is scheduled for February 20th at De Xin Elementary School.</p>
<h3>Hu Bei Middle School Approved for Registration</h3>
<p>Qiujiang Road Hu Bei Middle School was established in 1918. Later, due to a dispute over the demolition of houses in Yile Lane, it was forced to suspend operations. In the autumn of 1929, the board of directors was reorganized and continued to run a junior high school. Over the years, the student body has grown and the results have been remarkable. During the Shanghai War, the school site was appropriately located in the line of fire, resulting in significant losses. After the ceasefire and takeover, the school was relocated to 587 opposite the street, a four-story Western-style building, with spacious houses. Every effort was made to add various facilities to improve the school. A sports field was added, and a library was built to focus on management and actively restore the school. Recently, an application was submitted to the Municipal Bureau of Education for registration. After sending personnel to inspect, it was deemed qualified and approved at the bureau's meeting on the 10th of this month, and submitted to the Ministry of Education for record. It is reported that the school is scheduled to open on February 1st, and there has been a very enthusiastic response from all parties applying for enrollment.</p>
<h3>Pei Ying Girls' School Adds a Kindergarten</h3>
<p>The private Pei Ying Girls' Primary School in Tongchang Lane, Haining Road, Zhabei District, has been established for three years. Ms. Zhao Yanrong, the principal, has done considerable research on early childhood education. Now, in order to develop early childhood education, a kindergarten will be added starting next semester. The matter has been submitted to the Municipal Bureau of Education for approval and record.</p>
<p>Sports</p>
<h3>London to Have Nighttime Electric Football</h3>
<p>Approved by the English Football Association</p>
<p>(London Correspondence) Those who have long desired to hold nighttime electric football matches now seem to have achieved their final victory. The English Football Association Council has agreed to hold a football match under electric light at the White City Stadium. The official date has not yet been determined, but the important point is that the Council has changed its mind. In 1930, when there was a request to hold electric football, the Council firmly replied that such a competition was undesirable and prevented members from participating. Even with threats, this state remained until the Waldorf team and the London United teams renewed their request, which led to the current result. This White City Stadium can accommodate 50,000 spectators and is now the home field of the Queens Park Rangers team, a Division Three team in the London United League.</p>
<h3>Today's Football Match Canceled Due to Snow and Ice</h3>
<p>Tomorrow's Intercity Trial Match Undecided</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Western Union Football Association issued a notice stating that due to the heavy snowfall in recent days and the accumulation of snow on the field, reaching several inches in thickness, all football matches scheduled for today have been canceled. Whether tomorrow's (Sunday) intercity trial match to be held at the China Baseball Field can proceed as usual will depend on the weather conditions today. In addition, the China Football Association's matches scheduled for today have also been canceled.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Intercity Trial Match</p>
<h3>The Lineup is Roughly Determined for the 26th</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Hong Kong intercity football match for the 1933 season is scheduled to be held in Hong Kong during the Lunar New Year. The Shanghai side has already begun selecting representatives to travel south on the President Hoover on the 21st of this month. Details have been reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that the Hong Kong side's interest has grown since defeating Shanghai 4-3 in Shanghai last winter, and they are being more careful in selecting representatives, hoping to maintain their victory. A trial match has been scheduled for the 26th of this month. Few Chinese players have been selected this time. The following lineup is all under consideration:</p>
<p>B. Perris Bartley</p>

Last night, in the second game of the final, John's defeated Wanxing 38-29, winning both games and thus winning the championship. There were also two A-League games last night: (1) John's heavily defeated Xia Guang 64-29; (2) Jinan heavily defeated Jiang Wan 45-15.</p>
<h3>John's Wins Again Against Wanxing</h3>
<p>Wanxing Takes the Initiative Wanxing had great momentum at the beginning of the game, opening the scoring with a 2-0 lead. John's responded immediately.</p>
<p>However, Wanxing's Li Silin's long shot and Wang Jilu's free throw gave Wanxing a commanding 5-2 lead. John's counterattacked and scored four consecutive points to tie the game at 6-5. But Wanxing took the lead again with a 7-6 score.</p>
<p>One Point Alternates Up and Down After John's took a 6-5 lead, Wanxing countered with a 7-6 lead. For the next five minutes, it was a difficult and inseparable era, with the score alternating up and down three or four times. John's Ma Fangcui scored in the middle, giving John's an 8-7 lead. Then came 8-9, 10-9, 10-11, 12-11, until 12-11, when John's took a one-point lead, and the situation suddenly opened up.</p>
<p>John's Continues to Sail Smoothly At 14-11, Wanxing took a break, but Ma Fangcui and Zhang Yuanji scored four more points in a row. With such momentum, Wanxing suddenly showed signs of shaking and the line became chaotic. John's was unstoppable, reaching 25-11. The result of the first half was 29-14. In the second half, Wanxing still did not show any improvement. At the end of the game, the score was 52-25. John's High School won again and won the championship.</p>

<p>The Inauguration of the Shanghai Chinese Sports Club</p>
<h3>The building is scheduled to open on May 1st, and everything is officially established and is actively progressing</h3>
<p>The development of sports in Shanghai is the best in the country, but the organization of sports clubs has never been heard of. On the Western side, there are the Race Club, the Country Club, etc. Although their purpose is not purely to promote sports, they also promote various sports with great effort. Recently, many enthusiastic sports enthusiasts in China have realized the lack of such an organization, and thus initiated the establishment of a sports club. It was officially announced at 5:30 PM this Thursday at the Dahua Apartment on Jing'an Temple Road. However, the Chinese name has not yet been finalized, while the Western name is National Recreation Club. The initial purpose is to promote tennis, with the establishment of 15 tennis courts. In the future, it is planned to gradually expand. The economic aspect has been settled, and a building will be built on Daxilu Road. It is scheduled to officially open on May 1st of this summer. All affairs are being actively prepared by the organizing committee. This type of organization, which emphasizes both sports and entertainment, is still a first in Shanghai and deserves attention. The details are explored as follows:</p>
<h3>Founders</h3>
<p>Cheng Yize, Zhang Yuelian, Wei Boxiang, Zheng Zirong, Sun Linfang, Dong Dayou,</p>
<p>Li Baojun, Xi Jingyong, Xu Zhixiang, Chen Sanjiu, Wang Zhongwei, Huang Xuanping, Jiang Daozhang, Gu Qinghuang, Gu Qingyi, Chen Shuxun, Li Lei, Lu Pinqin, Li Zuhe, Tong Yuwen, Shen Liren, Cai Shi'an, Yuan Qiuchu, Zhang Zengpei, Zheng Huan, He Shuiyuan, Liang Guanliu</p>
<h3>Organizing Committee</h3>
<p>The organizing committee has been established, with Zhang Yuelian elected as the chairman of the organizing committee, and Jiang Daozhang as the secretary. The organizing committee members are Wei Boxiang, Sun Linfang, Dong Dayou, Li Baojun, Chen Sancai, Gu Qinghuang, and He Yongyuan. All affairs are actively underway. In the future, an executive committee will also be organized, and an executive secretary will be elected to preside over all affairs.</p>
<h3>Membership Types</h3>
<p>Membership is not limited to those interested in sports, including general, female, and student memberships. The entrance fee for general members is 30 yuan, and the annual fee is 40 yuan. The entrance fee for female members is 10 yuan, and the annual fee is 12 yuan. Student memberships are temporary, because schools must take vacations and cannot stay in Shanghai for a long time. Therefore, there is no entrance fee, only a monthly fee of 3 yuan. The budget assumes 400 general members, and 60 female and student members each. Together with other income from food and beverages, etc., this is enough to cover the annual expenses (the annual budget is less than 20,000 yuan). It is reported that there are already 300 general members.</p>
<h3>Construction Costs</h3>
<p>The location has been decided as on Great West Road, to construct a two-story Western-style building of 100 feet long and 50 feet wide. Dong Dayou has already planned the construction, with an estimated cost of approximately 20,000 yuan. Funding is also secured, planning to issue 20,000 yuan in public bonds to be subscribed by various promoters. Some are subscribing for 1,000 yuan, while others are subscribing for 500 yuan. The interior will include a banquet hall, dressing rooms, cloakrooms, shower rooms, etc. The lawn and hard tennis courts will have at least fifteen courts. The project is scheduled to be completed by the end of April this year and officially open on May 1st, it is said.</p>

<h3>Ceylonese Fire-Walking Ceremony</h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>— One of the World's Exotic Customs and Ballads —</p>
<p>"Exploring Boiling Water and Walking on Fire" has been said since ancient times, this is a metaphor, not a fact; unexpectedly in Ceylon across the two oceans, the people there have the art of fire-walking. Every year when the Aissala Festival arrives, [Note 1] which is July 17th, a grand ceremony is held for fire-walking, and the spectators are densely packed. A wide square is specially prepared in front of the temple, dry firewood is stacked into a bridge-like structure, and asphalt and tung oil are poured over and over again, intending to increase the burning power. There is a priest in charge of this, who determines when to start and when to finish burning. The burning starts from noon and ends in the early evening, the timing is crucial and must not be missed! The chief priest suddenly gives the order to ignite, and in an instant, it blazes fiercely; the worshippers burn the fire, worship, and sing, their attire is strange and varied. They bare their arms and perform a demonic dance together, chanting Sanskrit verses of "Prajnaparamita"; they walk barefoot, their movements erratic, sometimes slow, sometimes fast. Once the dancing is over, the fire-walking begins, initiated voluntarily, not by coercion; perhaps because they have offended the sacred deity, or because of personal misdeeds; once they desire to redeem their past sins, only fire-walking can wash them away. Before the chief priest gives the order to fire-walk, they stand before him with bowed hands; he bestows upon them the rituals and incantations, and then orders them to bathe to show purity. Once the chief priest gives the order to fire-walk, they walk barefoot, unafraid of the scorching heat; they lift their robes and step onto the burning embers, walking calmly, observing the precepts. At this time, the setting sun is just about to disappear behind the mountains, with red clouds scattered across the sky; but how can the red clouds compare to the red of the burning embers? People retreat from several feet away; only those fire-walkers remain. What is the meaning of their heroic and outstanding demeanor? To walk on fire without being burned is considered the only glory; otherwise, if the burning embers injure their skin, it indicates that the deity's anger has not yet been appeased; walking on and on until they reach the end of the ritual platform, [Note 2] the fire-walking ceremony is then declared complete; they compete to prostrate themselves before the deity, chanting Sanskrit hymns that soar through the clouds, their spirit resolute to this extent! When I hear of this, I sigh deeply! Now that the national crisis is upon us, how dare we indulge in comfort? If everyone embraces the spirit of fire-walking, perhaps this great calamity can be averted; otherwise, if we continue to dance and sing in revelry, we will sit and watch our homeland change colors, and once the conflagration ignites, what will become of us? Our Buddha only says: "It cannot be spoken of."</p>
<p>Note 1: Aissala means reverence for the gods, the Aissala Festival is the Festival of Reverence.</p>
<p>Note 2: Sgangda is the deity worshiped in Ceylon.</p>
<h3>Snow</h3>
<p>— Huo Xueming</p>
<p>— Poet and Dog —</p>
<p>After a day of warm rain, the weather cleared at dusk, followed by cold wind with sharp edges. The sky was full of yellow clouds, looking like it was about to snow. Finally, the earth turned completely white.</p>
<p>It is said that dogs love snow because they can see their own plum blossom-shaped footprints. However, I believe that poets love snow even more than dogs; because cooking wine in the icy weather and writing poetry amidst a white battlefield are elegant activities recognized and respected by noble scholars throughout history.</p>
<p>Bai Juyi's "Evening comes, the sky threatens snow, would you drink a cup with me?" captures the mood of awaited snow. Wang Wei's "Wind startles bamboo outside the window, opening the door, snow fills the mountain; scattering into the deep silent alley, accumulating white in the wide courtyard" captures the mood of admiring the snow when it falls. As for Cen Shen's Tian Shan Snow Song and White Snow Song, such magnificent and grand poetic realms are no less than Li Bai's "Heavenly soldiers shining in the snow descend Yuguan" and "Yan Mountain snowflakes are as big as mats," both capturing the mood of fighting amidst the snow in the northern regions. Now, amidst the red shadows of the island barbarians concentrating and shedding blood in Yuguan, there drifts swirling frozen snow, and our anti-Japanese heroes are in a season where "the general lies in fox fur, but cannot keep warm"! But what about our poets?</p>
<p>The relationship between snow and poets is as sweet as honey, so closely linked. Fan Chengda said, "It's not that charcoal must be sent in the snow, but to add scenery for poetry," which says it all.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is because the purity of snowflakes symbolizes the noble integrity of scholars, or perhaps it is because snow only falls in the harsh winter, believing that it possesses an aura of unyielding pride, that it is especially loved, which is also unknown. Chinese poets have always praised the importance of having an unyielding spirit in life.</p>
<p>As for why dogs are more excited in snowy weather, I believe that they run wildly on the snow, and besides the explanation of warming up, I cannot know any further. What is the meaning of young men and women skating on the solid ice of Beihai? I also cannot know.</p>
<p>Here, let me copy a poem about dogs and snow by Mr. Zhang Dayou of the Song Dynasty to end this short essay. The poem says:</p>
<p>"The universe is one chaotic whole, the ancient well a dark cave, yellow dog has white on it, white dog is swollen." Mr. Liu Dabai said about this poem: "Such descriptive means are truly admirable and astonishing; I am afraid that even the snow-praising poems of the great masters cannot achieve this!"</p>
<h3>Symbolism of Flowers</h3>
<p>— Ren Ying</p>
<p>— Fresh Blood and Freedom —</p>
<p>Two pots of unnamed flowers have been added to the flower stand, adorning the long corridor. Yesterday, as I dragged my tired body past, I noticed them in front of the flower stand. Slender petals, as crimson as blood, surrounded by delicate green leaves; I stood in silence before the flower stand.</p>
<p>Don't the crimson petals symbolize the unrestrained flow of fresh blood? Don't the tender green leaves symbolize liberation and freedom? The region south of the Yangtze River is shrouded in bright spring light, while the distant northern land, on the paths of ice and snow, sees the undulating movement of the nation's brave warriors. And in that vast, cold sky, amidst the deep snow, enemy iron birds are soaring. Splashing mud, blurred bloodstains, they are sacrificing their individual selves for the struggle of the entire nation! In the Heilong River, the blood tide of martyrs surges, and on Changbai Mountain, the corpses of heroes pile up. Enduring hunger and cold, forsaking family and fortune, isn't what they are hoping for the same as the green leaves of freedom?</p>
<p>To strive for the nation's freedom, the blood flowers of brave warriors must bloom. Flow, flow, let the unrestrained blood of the Chinese nation flow to the last drop. Hope, hope, hope for the green leaves bathing in the spring light.</p>
<p>When the bloodstains of the brave warriors receive their due price. In that not-so-distant tomorrow, next to the blood-like petals, will be the contrasting green of freedom. Let us create, at the forefront of that era; leave behind the fragrance of history.</p>
<h3>Seeking Justice</h3>
<p>— Zi Tai</p>
<p>— Justice Found for the God of War —</p>
<p>Justice had disappeared from the celestial realm, causing great panic among the gods; because their realm relied entirely on justice for its maintenance, and without justice, their realm would collapse.</p>
<p>Therefore, the gods of the celestial realm convened an emergency meeting to discuss the matter of finding justice. In the meeting hall, the God of Peace first stood up and spoke, saying that he was willing to do his best to find justice to safeguard the celestial realm. Later, the God of War followed, also saying, like the God of Peace, that he would retrieve justice. The gods, terrified by the disappearance of justice, immediately agreed to them upon hearing that these two great gods were willing to exert their efforts, and set them a deadline of three days to respond.</p>
<p>Three days later, the God of Peace was the first to respond. He said that he could not find justice. Because every place he went, he asked if they were hiding justice, or if justice had taken refuge there, and they all rejected him fiercely. Now, there was no way, and he had to return empty-handed. He begged for the forgiveness of the gods.</p>
<p>What about the God of War? He came to answer in no time. He said that he had already found justice. Because every place he went, he ultimately used all his military force to search and find it, no matter how they refused; finally, in one place, he found the disappeared justice. As he spoke, he showed the gods the justice he had found.</p>
<p>The celestial realm was therefore restored to peace. The gods were all relieved of their fear.</p>
<p>From this, they realized that only war can retrieve justice; and only war can proclaim justice to people.</p>
<h3>Fisherman</h3>
<p>— Yellow Poplar Woodcut</p>
<p>Novel</p>
<h3>Guilty Conscience</h3>
<p>— Liao Hongshou Juan</p>
<p>So he thought in confusion again: What if he couldn't get through this long snowy journey tonight? What then? When he arrived at his destination, what if he couldn't wake the deep sleep of the people in the house, what then? Even if he woke them up, what if they were unwilling to brave the cold to open the door, what then? If that were really the case, would he still have the courage to brave the wind and snow of more than ten miles to rush home again? Even if it were possible to rush home, would he still have the courage to face his stepmother's icy and cold face? If he didn't have this courage and went to other relatives and friends, would they not find him annoying in such cold weather and such a late night? Even if people weren't annoyed, would he be able to get such sincere and enthusiastic treatment? ... He thought blankly and couldn't help but mutter: 'Oh, oh, I'm afraid not! Oh, oh, it certainly won't!'</p>
<p>As soon as his mind recovered a little, his thoughts were more numerous than weeds under the spring breeze. He thought about what he should think about and what he shouldn't. The torrent of thoughts was surging, unable to be pushed away or discarded. As a result, he only felt that countless cells and blood in his whole body were completely filled with indescribable emotions of gratitude. He desperately wanted to find a set of tearful words of gratitude to express a little gratitude to his good friend, but after searching his brain, he couldn't even string together half a suitable sentence. In the end, he seemed unable to utter even the most common word 'thank you'. He just raised his bright but dull eyes and looked at them warmly. His eyes were full of tears, about to drip but not yet dripping.</p>
<p>Dongfang Sheng was his classmate before, and now he is only in his twenties. He is a broad-minded youth who inclines towards nature. His state is very heroic, and in his heroism, he carries a look of kindness and amiability. He was originally a model Christian, with the same universal loving heart as God. On the other hand, the gentleness of his actions is like that of a Buddhist believer. All these things are enough to match his kind appearance and are not like some people in the world who are outwardly good but inwardly filthy.</p>
<p>Dongfang Sheng's wife, Xiao Man, is only three or five years younger than Dongfang Sheng, but her appearance, expression, behavior, and speech are still completely like those of a young girl with her hair in pigtails. She carries a bit of innocence everywhere, and it is revealed naturally from time to time. She sits next to her husband, just like a lively and endearing little bird. Because she just got out of bed, her beautiful hair is fluffy, her sleepiness hasn't dissipated, and both cheeks are slightly flushed like the buds of a Chinese flowering crabapple from the warmth of the stove. Her expression contains kindness in liveliness, which is the same point between her and her husband. Especially her slightly sleepy but clear eyes, like autumn water, whenever they look at her face, her eyes seem to emit a warm and kind voice, as if saying: 'Alas! Poor person, poor child, why have you gotten into such a mess?' (5)</p>
<p>World Oddities</p>
<h3>Predictions for the Future of 1933</h3>
<p>— Special</p>
<p>The well-known French seer Madame Fraya predicted that President Hoover would fail in the election, that White Star An would end, that the postal ship George Maliba would burn, and that Doumer would be killed, all of which came true last year. Now that the old year has passed and the new year is approaching, she calculates that the future of the coming year is bleak. She said:</p>
<p>In 1933, we will still not be able to escape economic hardship. There will be many financial collapses in Europe and America. In the first few months of this year, relations between the United States and France will be tense, but they may gradually improve later. The year's luck for England is quite bad, and the harm to the pound will almost last throughout the year. Major changes will occur in India and other dependent territories. A politician in France will be in danger of assassination. A new figure will rise to power in France, and after he emerges, business will begin to turn around. His achievements are many, but they are mostly achieved through diplomatic means. Germany is actively preparing for war, and France is in danger of being attacked, but the attack will not be realized. The East is in a troubled autumn.</p>
<p>In the first few months of 1933, there will be great storms and disasters in the sky and at sea. Science will make great progress, and there will be extraordinary discoveries in medicine. A great leader in Germany will disappear from the political scene. Two politicians and two writers in France will depart from this world.</p>
<p>Spanish policy will take two decisive turns to the left. Relations between France and Italy will be more friendly than at the beginning of the year. Russian Bolshevism will suffer a major blow, and its political system will be shaken. After a battle, its policy will turn to a more peaceful Bolshevism.</p>
<p>Italy's fortune is very good, and its development will be even more brilliant. Latin America will remain turbulent, Argentina's finances can be expected to be stable, but a political revolution will occur within the country. Women in various countries will become more prominent. Much capital will change hands, and people in the middle class will suffer everywhere, leading to various incidents, but there will be no revolutions in France and North America.</p>
<p>After Roosevelt defeated Hoover in the American presidential election, Madame Fraya received hundreds of letters from the United States congratulating her on the complete accuracy of her predictions for 1932.</p>
<p>··················</p>
<p>Also, the Syrian Muhammad Shek, who lives in Cairo, the capital of Egypt, is famous for his stargazing. He predicts that in 1933, there will be war between France and Italy, with England assisting France, but it will encounter misfortune. The Balkans will be greatly affected as a result. There will be more chaos in Mexico, which will eventually be annexed by the United States. China and Japan will still not officially go to war, but they will still fight sporadic battles, resulting in an agreement of some kind. Other places, such as Iraq, Yemen, and Palestine, will all have some wars. In short, the future situation is very difficult, and there will be many disasters, it is said.</p>
<p>According to these two seers, their words about Franco-Italian relations are completely opposite. It is really not known which one is accurate, so we will wait until the end of the year to determine it.</p>
<h3>Testing Human Nature</h3>
<p>— Yi An</p>
<p>Lyon Berra of Marseille, France, wanting to test how his friends felt about him, suddenly issued a death notice and pretended to be dead and lay stiff in a coffin. When a group of friends gathered for the funeral, thinking that a final judgment had been made, they commented on the deceased's life. After Lyon Berra had finished listening to their words, he slowly got up from the coffin and thanked his friends. One person was so frightened that he died on the spot. The deceased's wife then sued Lyon Berra in court.</p>
<h3>The Price of a Dead Tiger</h3>
<p>— Yi An</p>
<p>The Yaoao region of India is plagued by tigers. In 1931, 85 people died from tigers. The more fortunate residents of this area are those of the class that has spears or firearms, for if they have these weapons, they can hunt and kill the tigers. Every time they catch a tiger, they first get a reward from the government, ranging from ten to twenty-five pounds. The tiger meat is then sold to the Chinese, for the Chinese in the south mostly love to eat tiger meat, believing that it can increase energy and strengthen muscles and bones. The fat is sold to the Indians for medicinal use to treat rheumatism. The bones and tiger claws can be made into ornaments, which fetch a high price. The tiger liver is sold to warriors, who say that eating it can increase courage. If it is a tigress, then her milk is said to be able to treat eye diseases. As for the tiger skin, it is sold to Europeans returning home. Statistics show that the value of a tiger can keep a hunter warm and fed for life.</p>

<h3>Swap Approaching, Gold Market Cooling Down</h3>
<p>General Industry Attitudes are Watchful</p>
<p>Central Bank Continues to Actively Sell Spot</p>
<p>(Fluctuation Range is Usually Narrow) Because the swap is approaching, each firm has no round number entries or exits, so yesterday's market was extremely quiet. Initially, New York silver prices contracted by 0.125, and forward silver prices fell by more than 0.02. The bank's private telegram was slightly higher at 1.875, although not much, people's hearts were stable. London large bars, although long, were not concerned. In addition, it seemed that bar stock was drying up. If there were a few buyers, the price would rise. The morning opened and immediately rose to 803 taels and 9 qian. The bank's opening price was also tighter because of this. Echoing each other, coupled with the Central Bank smoothly opening spot goods, the price was then seen at 0.05 taels. Soon, because the foreign exchange market tended to harden, and there was a lack of opponents in the market, although there were few sellers, there was still a downward trend of more than 0.03 taels. After entering, it remained flat, hovering around 0.03 taels. The afternoon market was even more stable, and the Central Bank continued to actively sell spot goods, sometimes as high as 0.05 taels and 6 qian. The Bombay early telegram rose by one anna, but the price was not small. This was because there were very few transactions at this time, and Heng Xing was inclined to enter. The later telegram fell by one anna, but the price instead fell. Fellow dealers adopted a wait-and-see attitude because the swap was imminent and the process was peaceful. Finally, between 0.03 taels and 0.04 taels, only a few qian fluctuation. It was delayed until the market closed at 804 taels and 1 qian. There was very little change throughout the city. The Central Bank continued to actively sell spot goods, but the momentum was slightly curbed. The market conditions before and after yesterday are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Morning Market Breaks Through the Hovering Face</h3>
<p>The morning opening was very positive, so it jumped to 803 taels and 9 qian immediately. The goods arrived slightly at 0.03 taels and 5 qian, and retail customers purchased them. The price rose to over 0.04 taels. Although Fuyu Dadecheng came out, they were few in number. Firms such as Dekang Hongkang Yong and others could support the strength, so it gradually increased to 0.05 taels, hovering for a long time. This was because Mitsui was buying March US dollars at 1.125. However, after this, the bank was willing to come out, and the gold price was also seen to go downstream. Yuanmao Yong Richang sold bars, and the price retreated to around 0.03 taels. Although Citibank peeled off April US dollars at 1.875, it sold March dollars at 0.0625. Zhongfu also came out at the same month and the same price. Fuyu Yuanmao Yong and others continued to sell, and the price fell to within 0.02 taels, at 1.8 qian. Heng Xing wanted to enter with a limit price, and Dadecheng also purchased. The price then rose to around 0.03 taels. The HSBC exchange rate for British exchange did not change. The US dollar fell by 0.125, which was irrelevant. Tianfeng Yong Yuanheng and others came out, retreating to 0.02 taels. Hengyu entered to over 0.025 taels. The news that the Central Bank was opening 4800 bars came, and people's hearts were shaken. March US dollars at 1.125 were not easy to settle, and Heng Xing came to enter in the market, starting up by one tael. There was not much trading on the table, and the foreign exchange market was also flat. April US dollars at 1.125 could be settled, and 1.875 could be sold. The gold price was also flat, with only a few qian fluctuation outside of 0.03 taels. When Nian Ba Yuan's January US dollars were wanted by the banks, the price was then seen at 0.04 taels. But at this time, it was all from the various clients entering and exiting. After staying for a moment, they were immediately seen selling off, going down by a little more than one tael. Heng Xing slightly absorbed it, not causing it to fall further. The Central Bank came to actively sell spot goods again. Wanxing on behalf of Tongfeng Heng came to enter, rising to 0.04 taels and 2 qian. However, Wanxing's own firm suddenly came out, and Zhaofengchang also sold, immediately returning to 0.03 taels. Dadecheng slightly entered at 0.03 taels and 2 qian, starting up by a few qian, to 0.03 taels and 6 qian. Huabi bought January US dollars at 0.9375, and the price was 0.02 taels and 2 qian. Heng Xing Dadecheng slightly entered, while Yuanchun Hengyu came out. Transactions were all few, so there were ups and downs within 0.03 taels. Finally, Fuyu came to enter, rising to 0.03 taels and 7 qian. The goods then came out, falling by a few qian, so the market closed at 0.03 taels and 6 qian.</p>
<h3>Afternoon Market Stagnant and Good at 0.028 Taels</h3>
<p>The afternoon market opened at 803 taels and 5 qian, and trading was even clearer, and the market situation was even flatter. Yuanmao Jing came to enter bars, rising to over 0.04 taels. Citibank bought January US dollars at 0.9375, and Heng Xing also purchased, rising to 0.04 taels and 5 qian. At this time, there was a slight fluctuation of a few qian, which was because the goods were profiting from it. Soon, the price was 0.03 taels and 9 qian. After this, Heng Xing came to purchase, and small sellers watched, and the price became around 0.05 taels. At this time, Heng Xing had acted on behalf of the Central Bank, so Hongxing Dadecheng Daxing Yong also came to enter, gradually increasing to 0.05 taels and 6 qian. Bombay telegraphed that it had risen by one anna, although the price was slightly less, a few qian, because Heng Xing's buying sentiment was strong at this time. Later, Bingxing Yuanmao Yong repeatedly came to sell, and Heng Xing also came to enter from time to time. The price hovered from time to time at around 0.05 taels. When the Bombay telegram informed that it had fallen by 1/2 anna, it was slightly entered by Hengyu, rising to 0.05 taels. Huabi sold May US dollars at 1.125, and Dadecheng sold bars, and the goods also echoed from the side, falling to 0.03 taels and 9 qian. Later, there was nothing calm, falling into a state of suspension. There was only a call price but no transaction price. It was delayed until the ship closed at 804 taels and 1 qian. The goods were still pressed at 0.03 taels and 8 qian. It was found that the highest price of the day was 805 taels and 6 qian, and the lowest was 801 taels and 8 qian, with only 0.03 taels and 8 qian up and down. As a result, the closing price was 0.028 taels higher than the previous closing price.</p>
<h3>More Than One Tael Strong in the Opening Price</h3>
<p>The opening price was 0.125 less due to the shrinkage of the US exchange rate listing, calculated at 17.625 yuan. The listed gold price was 868 taels, 7 qian, and 8 fen. According to the closing price, it was about 64 taels plus or minus, 1 tael more pressed down than the previous closing. January's book entry was the same as February's, at 804 taels, and the water top-up was 801 taels.</p>
<h3>Central Bank Opens Another 700 Bars</h3>
<p>The Central Bank opened approximately 630 bars in the morning market, handled by Heng Xing Tongfeng Heng Dadecheng Yingfeng Heng and others. The price ranged from 0.02 taels to 0.015 taels. In the afternoon market, another 70 bars were opened, priced at 0.05 taels, done on behalf of Heng Xing.</p>
<h3>Trading on the Surface: Scattered Transactions</h3>
<p>Trading on the surface is sluggish, with much watching and waiting. Hengxing, Hengyu, Yifeng, Yongtong, and Fenghengqing are buying in small amounts. Tianfengyong, Neixingyuan, Maoyong, Zhaofengchang, Daxingyongfu, Taihengyuan, and Xinyongrichang are selling more than buying. Dadecheng is selling first and then buying. Dalian merchants are selling slightly and smoothly. Wanxing is selling slightly in the morning market and buying in the afternoon market. For the remaining categories, Yifeng from Guangdong merchants shows little activity. Hengxing is buying in about 400 items. Apart from these, all transactions are sporadic, lacking significant buying or selling.</p>
<h3>Red Market: Extremely Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the exchange rate remained at an additional nine taels, with very few transactions. Only Yingfengheng sold slightly, while Dafengheng bought, with only seven transactions. All spot goods firms showed no interest in buying or selling. The transaction price was slightly depressed, as the swap period approached, causing some concern.</p>
<h3>Futures Swap: Sellers Slightly Offer More</h3>
<p>Although this swap period has not yet begun, the general sentiment among traders in the market is that sellers are offering slightly more. However, the bulls claim that they can offer three to four taels, while the general view is around two taels. Although the Central Bank continues to buy spot goods, the abundance of spot goods this time suggests that there will be no price manipulation. Based on the current spot and delayed prices, the premium for this swap should not be too large. Although the swap is next Monday, as tomorrow is Sunday, traders usually conduct business one day earlier. Therefore, the actual situation may become clear today. Since firms owe the Central Bank only about 4,000 items, the bulls have a slight advantage.</p>
<h3>Exchange Rates: Slightly Tighter in the Future for British and American Currencies</h3>
<p>Banks and precious metal firms have very few transactions... and minimal fluctuations.</p>
<p>According to foreign news yesterday, London's long-term rate rose slightly by 0.0625, with small exchange rate fluctuations. American silver fell by 0.125, and the forward silver market also dropped by more than 1%. Bank private cables thus contracted by 0.1875. The opening sentiment in the morning was excellent, so the near-term British exchange rate opened slightly tighter than the previous close, at 1 shilling 7 pence 9375. The American exchange rate, due to the insufficient decline in silver prices, was tighter but not much, at 27.875 yuan for January. Although the gold market rose, the silver market remained the same, so the gold price was lowered and loosened by 0.0625. The HSBC exchange rate listing for British currency remained unchanged, while the American currency only moved slightly by 0.125, which was unsatisfactory. Moreover, because transactions did not seem to be active, the market situation was also sluggish. The morning session fluctuated around 0.0625, with mutual advances and retreats. The afternoon market was slightly tighter, with transactions. Both the precious metal and exchange markets tended to be quiet. HSBC slightly tightened, while traders from the East Asia Bank were buying. Apart from these, transactions were sporadic and lacked a clear direction. Gold firms bought at the opening in the morning, but little activity was heard afterwards. Throughout the day, there was a fluctuation of about 0.125. As a result, the exchange rate tightened by 0.0625, and the American exchange rate also rose by 0.0625 compared to the previous close. The buying and selling of British and American currencies throughout the day are recorded on the left.</p>
<p>(British Currency) The morning opening was tighter by 0.0625 compared to the previous close, at 1 shilling 7 pence 9375. In the morning, only HSBC sold January currency at 1 shilling 8 pence, as buying interest was lacking. Extending to the closing price, the selling price for January was 1 shilling 7 pence 19375, for February 8 pence, and for March and April both 0.0625. There were still few transactions in the afternoon market. Shanghai bought February currency at 1 shilling 8 pence, which was sold by Mitsui. HSBC continued to sell May and June currency at 0.0625, purchased by the Sino-French Bank. The closing selling price for January was 1 shilling 7 pence 9375, the same price for February, and the buying price was 1 shilling 8 pence. March was 1 shilling 8 pence, the same price for April, and the buying price was 0.0625.</p>
<p>(American Currency) Also slightly tighter by 0.0625, with the near-term opening selling price at 27.875 yuan. Mitsui bought March currency at 0.125, Citibank bought April currency at 0.1875. Pan-Gen and Mitsui traded April currency at 0.25. Citibank sold February currency at 0.0625, and Zhongfu also sold the same month at the same price. Hewfeng sold to Zhongfu March currency at 0.125. The American Feng blocked, and Huabi bought January currency at 28 yuan. Huabi also bought spot goods at 28 yuan. Zhengjin purchased Huabi's January currency at 9375. The noon closing price for January was 27.9375 yuan, for February 28 yuan, for February 0.0625, and for April 0.125. Afternoon transactions were sluggish. First, Citibank sold to Zhongfu January currency at 9375. Pan-Gen also tightened, March currency at 0.0625. Citibank then sold February currency at 9375, which was purchased by Anda. The Orient Bank bought May currency at 0.125, which was sold by Huabi. The closing selling price for January was 27.875 yuan, for February 9375, for March 28 yuan, and for April 0.0625. The buying price ranged from 9375 to 28.125 yuan. The price of one US dollar, due to the listing shrinking by 0.125, was changed to 3 taels 6 qian 1 fen 9 li 9 hao of silver.</p>
<h3>Long-Term Rate Contracts by 0.0625</h3>
<p>National News Agency, London, 13th: Long-term rates declined slightly, with the closing price for the near term at 16 pence 875 and the long term at 16 pence 9375, both down by one-sixteenth compared to the previous day. The opening exchange rate for British and American currencies was 3 yuan 3 jiao 4 fen 25.</p>

<h3>The Terrifying Shrinking Wind of Copper Coins</h3>
<p>Shrinking by 7,000 pieces, totaling 10,000 pieces this week</p>
<p>Cash Concentration, Flat Interest Rates, No Hope for Turnaround</p>
<p>The end of the lunar year is approaching, and the period for closure is imminent. The phenomenon of silver dollars increasing in value is becoming more apparent, and the concentration of cash is even greater than usual. Therefore, there is no possibility of a turnaround in the market price for interest rates. The economic situation in various commercial sectors is becoming even more strained. It is observed that in the past month or two, the prices of various goods have been unusually low, which is actually due to the rush to sell goods for cash, rather than due to cheaper sources. The tension in the external silver market can be seen from this.</p>
<h3>Silver Dollar Interest Rates Fall, Silver Discounts Remain the Same</h3>
<p>The early market interest rate for silver dollars remains the same as before, at 7 qian 1 fen 3 li 7 hao 5 si. The afternoon market suddenly falls by 6 hao 2 si 5 hu, to 7 qian 1 fen 3 li 1 hao 2 si 5 hu. Banks have no desire to buy. The early and afternoon markets for silver discounts still open with a 2-fen premium, and there are plenty of premiums, but no one is interested. Therefore, the added value remains without price, opening with a plain surcharge.</p>
<h3>Small Silver Dollars Rise, Copper Coins Shrink Greatly</h3>
<p>The early market price for small Jiangnan silver dollars is 6 qian 3 fen 3 li 5 hao, and the afternoon market price is 6 qian 3 fen 5 li. As a result, the price has increased by 1.5 li compared to the previous day. The trading volume is 11,500 jiao in the morning market and 12,000 jiao in the afternoon market. The early market price for small Guangdong silver dollars is 6 qian 2 fen 2 li 5 hao, which is 1 hao 2 si 5 hu better than the previous day. The afternoon market is down by 375, to 6 qian 2 fen 2 li 1 hao 2 si 5 hu. The trading volume is 135,000 jiao in the morning market and 110,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins shrank sharply by 7,000 pieces, to 378,000 pieces. The total for this week shrank by 10,000 pieces. The trading volume is 32,120, with the equivalent silver valued at 8,500 taels.</p>
<h3>Extremely Tight Silver Remittance and Settlement</h3>
<p>Yesterday's silver remittance and settlement, in terms of the needs, were actually impossible to be easy. Only because there were many procedures to be completed, it was very tight. Chinese merchants remitted and settled over 3.2 million, foreign merchants remitted and settled 2.3 to 2.4 million, settlement remittance and settlement still had more than 2 million, advances were more than 1.2 million, pawn transactions were more than 1 million, special remittance and settlement were more than 3 million, various goods and foreign exchange taxes and other remittances were more than 8.8 to 8.9 million, warehouse releases were 900,000, private bank public bills remittances and settlements were more than 29 million, surcharges remittance and settlement were more than 4.1 million, closing remittances and settlements were more than 1 million, remittances and settlements from various sources were more than 800,000, and cash receipts were more than 500,000.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Is Flat and Usage Is Common</h3>
<p>Transactions in the market, foreign exchange is still sparse and weak. Foreign exchange remittances made 695,000 in the morning and 750,000 in the afternoon. Banknotes were 65,000 in the morning and 55,000 in the afternoon. Outside the market, banknotes were 85,000 in the morning and 75,000 in the afternoon. Check transactions were 80,000 in the morning and 90,000 in the afternoon. Bank trading had inter-bank trading of 550,000 in the morning and inter-bank trading of 800,000 in the afternoon. Various bank foreign exchange accounts received and settled more than 1.9 million, foreign exchange surcharges remittance and settlement were more than 1.7 million, banknote receipts and disbursements were 1.5 to 1.6 million, foreign exchange loan transactions were more than 1.5 million, foreign exchange pawn transactions were more than 700,000, going into the stomach was 200,000, the source was more than 400,000, private bank foreign exchange public bills remittance and settlement was more than 10.5 million, and small private bank transactions were more than 700,000.</p>
<h3>Bank Warehouse Receipts Checked at the Beginning of the New Year</h3>
<p>This year, after the cash concentration, various banks on the Bund slightly made payments and receipts. Yesterday (Friday, the 11th), the banks gathered at the Benefit Association to check the warehouse receipts. From this, one can know the general situation.

<h3>Bond Prices Increase by About Half a Yuan</h3>
<p>|Traded Four Million Seven Hundred Thousand|</p>
<p>Yesterday (13th), the trading situation at the Chinese Securities Exchange was that the futures market was far from being as good as before, and the market sentiment was very clear. It was a calm atmosphere. The morning trading was about 2.2 million yuan, and the afternoon market was 2.5 million yuan, totaling 4,695,000 yuan. Among them, except for the salt tax, which still had one million plus yuan, the others were only around 300,000 to 400,000 yuan. Customs duties, full six-gold long nine-six, were extremely clear. The spot market was also as deserted as before, with each bond only having several thousand yuan, totaling only 9,500 yuan. As for changes, its sluggish situation was no different from before. Although there were slight rises and falls between the boards, they only shifted with the market conditions of supply and demand at the time. The rise was very small. The environment was as chaotic as before, large households were watching, market transactions were scarce, and supply and demand were very flat. The entire day only revolved around six or seven jiao, and compared to the previous day, only full six-customs-gold morning slightly shrunk, and the others all rebounded firmly. However, except for the 20-roll futures, which were about eight jiao higher, the others were only about three or four jiao higher. The market situation was indeed dull.</p>
<h3>New York Stock Market As Stagnant As Before</h3>
<p>Thursday, the New York stock market fell back on wheat, and the trend was weak again. Wheat fell one point because of rumors that the Far East purchased 37 million bushels of Australian wheat. Also, the brokers' loans announced this week totaled $386,000,000, a decrease of $13,000,000 compared to last week. The Dow Jones index is listed below:</p>
<p>Closing Price Compared to the Previous Day</p>

<h3>Gradually Improving Standard Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<p>Intensifying the Boycott Work</p>
<p>The Future of Chinese Cotton Consumption Is Promising</p>
<p>······························</p>
<p>Rain and Snow Intertwined, Sources Scarce</p>
<p>Cotton Market Buyers' Intentions Are Strong</p>
<p>The yarn market is trending up, but actual demand remains sluggish. Various merchant groups have weaker purchasing power due to economic reasons. However, some have seen news reports advising economic disengagement and are intensifying efforts to boycott inferior goods. The sales of Chinese cotton may increase, and sentiment is better. Some foreign cotton has fallen by five or six yuan.</p>
<h3>Standard Cotton Recovers by Seven or Eight Qian</h3>
<p>In the early market for standard cotton, near-term prices were flat. Due to a slight drop in American cotton, the situation in the future months was seen as firm, rising by seven or eight qian. The reason was said to be the intensification of boycott work, and retail investors bought in to cover their short positions, causing the price to rise. Near-term prices rose by three, four, six, and seven qian. The market sentiment seemed strong in the afternoon, but trading was very light. Prices for all months rose again by one, four, and five qian. The total trading volume for the day was 12,800 bales. It was found that Sen Kang sold 990 bales, Suilong 300 bales, Minghua 400 bales, Mingde 400 bales, and Jifeng 350 bales. Chunji bought 400 bales, Sen Kang 450 bales, Yuande 400 bales, and Changfeng 600 bales. The closing prices are listed below:</p>
<p>Standard Cotton Closing Price Increase/Decrease Stock Account Number April 147, Up 7 41,800</p>
<p>January 1451, Down 8 28,500 May 1480, Up 5 50,350</p>
<p>February 1438, Up 7 47,600 June 1487, Up 8 8,700</p>
<p>March 1460, Up 8 5,400 Total 212,450</p>
<h3>Extremely Sluggish Spot Yarn Sales</h3>
<p>The total purchases of various merchant groups for the day were only 271 bales, and the market was flat. The purchase amounts of each merchant group are listed below:</p>
<p>Jinan 30 Jiangxi 2 Xiamen 40 Ningbo 25</p>
<p>Inland 54 Peers 20 Guangdong 100</p>
<p>The cotton market is slightly firm, but the overseas cotton market is dull, and sentiment is stable. However, buyers have favorable intentions due to rain and snow, difficult transportation on various routes, and the resulting decline in sources. The pulling force is still strong. As for this month, short positions have been prepared sufficiently, and there is likely to be no significant fluctuation. However, the distant months are quite high, and the price difference between near and distant months reaches one or two taels and eight qian.</p>
<h3>Futures Cotton Is Most Popular</h3>
<p>In the early market for futures cotton, the market sentiment remained flat. As the auctions reached the distant months, they became slightly firmer. In general, buyers had a strong interest in taking long positions in the distant months, expecting more increases in the lunar New Year, so the price rose by one qian. In the afternoon, the prices for the months rose by five, eight, and eight, and the distant months rose by another one and a half qian. However, foreign cotton fell by one yuan. The total trading volume for the day was 25,700 dans. Deji sold 1,300 dans, Yuanda 900 dans, Suilong 2,000 dans, and Changhe 1,500 dans. Hengde bought 1,000 dans, Rongyu 1,100 dans, Xinheng 1,700 dans, Yifeng 1,200 dans, and Tongfu 900 dans. The closing prices are listed below:</p>

<h3>Foreign Cotton Falls More Than It Rises</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market was strong, but it softened at the close due to long position liquidation and Wall Street's weakness. Futures fell by one to three points, and spot prices were unchanged. British cotton futures fell by one or two points, and spot prices fell by five points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by five points. The Indian cotton market was firm and stable, with short covering in Pingguoer and Aomula. Pingguoer fell by 1.75 rupees, Aomula rose by 0.25 rupees, and Bailuoxi fell by 1.375 rupees. The original telegram, Green Left (12th telegram).</p>

<h3>Little Rice Arrives Downriver Amidst Heavy Snow</h3>
<p>| | Prices Increase Again by 1, 2, 3, or 4 Jiao Per Hu | |</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Due to the continuous wind and snow yesterday, the source of supply was even more scarce, with only numbers 5 and 6 arriving. The remaining goods in Pudong saw an opportunity to tighten up, so the selling prices were chaotic, with increases of 3 to 4 jiao. These were all stores in urban and rural areas. However, the trading volume yesterday could not be considered formal. It is said that many rice boats were blocked by the wind in the Minhang area. If the wind and snow stop, they can all arrive in Shanghai one after another. It is thought that prices may be flattened somewhat at that time. Juyi did not open due to the decline in Tianjin prices and the lack of Bo rice. Only a few hundred shi of factory Bo rice were traded at the original prices. Xiangyang tips and Xiangyuan were both popular goods, but there was no large demand.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, ships numbered 32 and 33 arrived. White rice sales continued, and the market was even tighter. There were slightly more sources of Bo rice, and sales were still good, with prices standing firm. Early rice arrivals were scarce and sales were active. Du tips were scarce, while medium and lower grades were slightly available, and prices were tight. Yangbu tips were scarce, and sales were not bad, with prices increasing. Ke tips were also tight, and Baiyuan arrivals were not numerous, with retail sales being brisk and prices increasing again by 2 to 3 jiao.</p>
<h3>Ke Yuan Is Out of Stock, Price Is High by Half a Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Ke Yuan and Ke Xian arrivals were scarce. The market was originally looking good, and with few rice arrivals downriver, both northern and southern merchants had strong appetites. Yesterday, due to snow obstruction, the source of supply was even scarcer, and rice prices downriver rose and goods were scarce. Therefore, local hoarders focused on Ke Yuan. However, because the amount of Ke Yuan arriving recently was small, there was a need to build up stocks. Once local hoarders and both local and guest merchants competed to purchase, prices suddenly rose by half a yuan. Then, hoarders and local retailers purchased 669 bags of Hunan Zhong Yuan at prices as high as 10 yuan and 3 to 4 jiao. 586 bags of Wuhu machine-milled Yuan sold at prices as high as 10 yuan and 3 jiao to 4 jiao and a half, with medium grades at 9 yuan and 8 jiao 9 fen to 7 jiao and a half. Both northern and southern merchant demand was active. After the rice prices rose, attention turned to Ke Xian. It is estimated that northern merchants purchased 500 bags of Hunan machine-milled oil at prices ranging from 9 yuan and 5 fen to 9 yuan. Quanzhou merchants in the south purchased 550 bags of Jiangxi machine-milled late rice at prices up to 9 yuan and 3 fen, both of which were up by 25 fen compared to the previous day. Sales were active and arrivals were scarce, and the outlook for the market remained good.</p>
<h3>Vermicelli Market Guest Merchants Emerge</h3>
<p>| | Reportedly Reaching 800,000 to 900,000 Bags | |</p>
<p>Yesterday in the vermicelli market, after the opening in the morning and afternoon, the market for each month showed a consistent downward trend. Foreign wheat quotations continued to decrease by about 2 to 3 jiao. Because the market sentiment was not good when the opening price was set in the morning, it was down by more than 1 fen compared to the previous day's closing price. Although the purchasing desire of actual sales merchants was tight, they were purchasing spot goods on one hand and closing out futures positions on the other. Within three or four days, guest merchants returned 800,000 to 900,000 bags of futures, which was huge. New account bulls were very limited, and even those who appeared to be bulls could not arouse market sentiment. In the afternoon, the market sentiment continued to weaken, because Australian wheat came into activity again. It was initially set to open at 3 taels and 7 qian, but later a new foreign firm managed to secure business, cheaply at 2 taels, 6 qian, 6 hao, and 8 and a half si. Factories and trading houses agreed to deliver three ships, mostly loaded with March goods. The continued weakness in market sentiment was due to this. As a result of the closing, the current month fell by 1 fen 7 li and a half compared to the previous day, February fell by 2 fen, March fell by 2 fen and 2 li and a half, April fell by 1 fen and 2 li and a half, May fell by 7 li and a half, and June fell by a few fen.</p>
<h3>Yellow Soybeans Are Only Purchased by Domestic Factories</h3>
<p>Although the yellow soybean market is fair, it is actually due to the approaching of the old year, so the situation is between two possibilities: going in or going out. Therefore, the current goods are slightly in consolidation. Yesterday, Kangjiageng entered three cars of Huaihai soybeans, one car of Zhengyangguan soybeans, 700 bags of Tushan soybeans, and one car of Wuhe soybeans. This was internal factory demand. Two packages of Pudong Du soybeans were traded by Guangdong merchants. Red sorghum sold two cars. The market belonged to a stable trend. Local merchants bought 56 bags of raw kernels, and the market showed great improvement. The oil situation was stable.</p>
<p>According to Reuters, London, 12th, Chinese horse beans rose sharply to 64.50 (per 120 pounds). Peanuts with shells rose slightly to 12.9, and shelled ones fell slightly to 14.50.</p>
<h3>Chicago Wheat Falls Back</h3>
<p>Xinhua Trading Company Report (12th), Chicago wheat fell by 0.625 to 1 point because the market rumored that the Far East entered 37 million bushels of Australian wheat. Also, the transaction number on the 11th was 40 million bushels. The market price on the 12th is listed below.</p>
<p>Closing Price Compared to the Previous Day</p>
<p>May 49.50 Down 0.625</p>
<p>July 48.900 Down 1.000</p>
<p>September 49.375 Down 0.875</p>
<p>Silk and Tea</p>
<h3>Compilation of Chinese and Foreign Silk Reports</h3>
<p>(European and American Silk Telegrams Still Rarely Being Forwarded to Shanghai) Since the opening of various silk weaving factories in Europe and the United States in the New Year, Shanghai's yellow and white silk has been deemed too expensive, as the silk in hand is sufficient to meet demand. Yesterday morning, they were still rarely being forwarded to Shanghai, and the attitude of Chinese silk merchants remained idle. Existing silk transactions were still scarce.</p>
<p>(Antung Actively Stores Silk Before Forwarding to Shanghai) With the situation in Northeast China becoming increasingly tense, the silk stored in ports such as Antung and Yantai is now actively being forwarded to Shanghai. Yesterday, regular ships such as Dingsheng and others brought 184 pieces of raw silk to Shanghai.</p>
<p>(Sales of Artificial Silk Generally Remain Flat) Yesterday, the artificial silk market in Shanghai was flat because the Tianjin merchants stopped operations, and the Zhejiang and Shandong merchants were also idle because the closing period was approaching. Only local silk weaving factories purchased 32 boxes of Xingzhong Star brand artificial silk at a stable price.</p>
<p>(New York Raw Silk Sales Decline) Raw silk sales were sluggish last month (i.e., December). The American silk merchants in Shanghai received a telegram from the American Silk Association that the total amount of raw silk sold by silk weaving factories in the New York gold market in December was approximately 4548 packages. Among them, Japanese silk accounted for slightly less than 37,000 packages, Chinese silk accounted for only 2,952 packages, and the remainder was Italian and French raw silk.</p>
<h3>Zhenmei Pearl Tea's Active Sales in France</h3>
<p>Yesterday at the Shanghai tea market, Jardine Matheson, a British trading house, once again purchased Zhenmei pearl tea from both Luzhuang and Tuzhuang routes in large quantities. The spring sales in the Moroccan market were already active, and the tea prices in Shanghai were already extremely low. Therefore, transactions were quite strong, with total sales reaching 1,200 boxes. Most of them were Zhenmei from Wuyuan. As for the highest-quality goods in the northern route, because prices in Africa were tightening, Chinese merchants had a firm attitude, but there were still no large transactions.</p>
<p>North and South Goods</p>
<h3>Daylily Market is Tightening Daily</h3>
<p>Recently, because the market for daylilies is consistently tight, the trend is tightening daily. The current market price for goods from upper and middle merchants requires at least 14 taels before they are willing to sell. Therefore, merchants have been buying in recent days. Although there is some demand from sellers, they all want to buy cheaply. In order to reduce losses, only scattered transactions have been made. According to observations from people in the industry, there is hope that the price may reach 16 taels in the coming spring.</p>
<p>Metals</p>
<h3>New Iron Wire Awaits Movement in Stillness</h3>
<p>The trade in new iron wire has been sluggish for a long time. As a result, fellow traders all feel unmotivated to conduct business. The morning price is low, with No. 16 to No. 20 estimated at only 12 taels and 7 mace and 5 candareens per picul. Nos. 21, 23, and 15 are estimated at 13 taels and 2 mace. Aside from sporadic purchases for small-scale drawing, the market is essentially devoid of transactions. In recent days, there has been a sense of stillness awaiting movement. Dealers from Wenzhou, Sichuan, and Hankou have all made inquiries, and traders from Gu's group are also in negotiations. As a result, confidence has strengthened, and the market is on the rise, with prices expected to increase. It is reported that yesterday, 140 to 150 piculs were offered, with Nos. 16 to 20 priced at 13 taels and 5 mace per picul, and Nos. 21 to 25 priced at 14 taels per picul.</p>
<p>According to a Reuters dispatch from London on the 12th, tin has shown signs of weakness, lead has slightly risen, and tinplate remains unchanged. Also, according to a New York dispatch on the same day, tin and antimony have slightly risen, with tin at $22.875 per pound and antimony at $5.75.</p>
<p>Oil Market</p>
<h3>Asphalt Inventory is Not Thick</h3>
<p>丨Tung Oil Foreign Telegram Trends Downward丨</p>
<p>Since the continuous decline of asphalt in Hankou, the North and South have moved in opposite directions after the General Manager of the Zhejiang Railway. This kind of market situation is inherently accidental. The current new output is temporarily showing a sluggish trend, but it will not last long. Now, new goods from various brands in Hankou have arrived, and it is said that the new goods are superior to last year's old goods and the prices are lower, so sales are also moving. Heavy Jing is still at 12 taels and 7 or 8 mace, and Ordinary Jing is at 12 taels and 3 or 4 mace. High-quality Tianjin asphalt is at 12 taels, and slightly lower quality is at 11 taels and 8 or 9 mace. The price of Macheng oil once fell to 21 taels and 4 or 5 mace, but then rose by 1 mace and 4 candareens due to insufficient supply. The current market price is 11 taels and 7 or 8 mace, mainly because the Zhejiang Railway's prices are high, so they are all purchased from the Hankou market. However, sales in various places are lower than in previous years, which is due to the bankruptcy of the rural economy and the decline of all industries, not just one industry. Local merchants are buying and selling as they go. Although there are continuous arrivals of goods for both local and out-of-town merchants, they are enough to sell as they arrive, and there is rarely any accumulation. Fortunately, factories are not immediately purchasing goods, and are dedicated to supplying the candle-making market, so they are not in a state of destitution.</p>
<p>According to a Reuters dispatch from London on the 12th, tung oil fell by one penny to 38.6. Also, according to a New York dispatch on the same day, tung oil remains at 4.375.</p>
<p>Piece Goods</p>
<h3>Light Woolen Fabric Market Remains Strong</h3>
<p>Broadcloth, Watterine, Tweed</p>
<p>Although the sales season for imported woolen fabrics such as broadcloth, Watterine, and tweed has passed, those holding the goods are unwilling to sell them off, and the trend remains strong, mainly because the spring sales season will soon begin, and they are waiting for the prices to rise before selling them. Currently, Ningfeng checkered Watterine is selling for 2 taels, 9 mace, and 5 candareens net, Dafugui Suo Watterine is 3 taels and 2 mace, Pengshou Broadcloth is 2 taels and 4 mace, and Rongtai 15330 Laotou brand Constitutional Pattern Straight Tribute Cloth is 7 taels and 2 mace and 5 candareens, and Anli Jubao Basin is 5 taels and 8 mace.</p>

<p>Ten Years Later (2)</p>
<p>— Mo Ji</p>
<p>"But I failed, completely failed! Now I have to make a new decision, girl!"</p>
<p>"I know all about your struggles, I know all about them, ever since you left me." She remembered my past.</p>
<p>"Isn't that right," I said, "I left my apprenticeship to work in a factory, and when the factory closed down, I went to school. With my bare hands, I fought from east to west, and at that time I admired you so much! But my parents said that even if you struggled to go to school, you wouldn't be able to become an official after graduation! So you weren't qualified to have me. This place is filled with old gentry and rich men, so my parents sold me to them."</p>
<p>I paused at her words, with no room to refute them! She continued:</p>
<p>"I remember the past completely, I haven't forgotten a single thing: when you and I were close, you were already a complete slave. At first, you didn't resist at all, you lived your apprenticeship life meekly and obediently. But at that time I sympathized with you, I admired your ability to endure hardship, so when you brewed tea, I lit the fire for you, and when you cooked, I helped you. When I came to your store to play, you often came to my house too, and I helped you solve all your difficult problems; when you suffered insults and scolding from your boss, I tried to comfort you; when you injured your foot, I got you good food from my kitchen window. I nursed you, so that you could recover quickly. I treated you with such sincerity, completely from the bottom of my heart, and I wished to be close to you. So I didn't care when others said bad things about us. You ask me if I still have the you that I used to call 'brother' in my heart, please don't ask me that, because it makes me sad!</p>
<p>"Do you remember? I gave you my whole body: I hid it from my mother and let you kiss me, hug me, and——! You are a good person, I don't resent you at all, I wish you could jump from being a slave to being free, but now, you are still..."</p>
<p>"Just wishing that I alone could be free is not enough!..."</p>
<p>I also shed tears, hearing her words coming from her truly tender heart.</p>
<p>"You don't have to shed tears, dear! I haven't finished speaking yet:</p>
<p>"My parents said that their predictions were not wrong: you would not become an official. And indeed, now you don't even have a small job. I know you are starving, from slave to slave, that's what you are. Recently, I learned from books that you have many heavy stones on your shoulders! And on those stones stand many so-called 'rich people'. But I never imagined that Ying'er, who once sympathized with and helped you in your slave life, is now also standing on your shoulders. Please understand that I am pained by this! In these ten years of separation, I have often thought of you, but I could never see you again, so now, your image has finally become blurred; seeing you today, who would have known that you would be the you who has been destroyed, worn down, and tormented by the world and society for the past ten years!"</p>
<p>I stood by her bed, and hot tears dripped onto her dress. I was grateful that she could pity the weak person she had once sympathized with. I could only explain to her: (To be continued)</p>
<h3>An Appeal for Peace</h3>
<p>— Yang Xingzhi</p>
<p>Yesterday, this newspaper published an article by Mr. Wang Jingwei recently published in Geneva, urgently appealing for world peace. Mr. Wang's spirit of "loving peace" and "maintaining peace" is truly worthy of our sincere admiration.</p>
<p>However, what is the interpretation of the so-called "peace" at present? Mr. Wang seems to be a bit "feigning ignorance." In our view, in a world ruled by capitalist imperialism, the correct interpretation of peace is only the balance of power among the imperialist powers, only the intensified preparation for "plunder" and "armed conflict," and the disarmament conference meetings of generals and the League of Nations meetings of lords on peace are nothing more than a smoke screen to deceive the eyes and ears of the world's working masses. Therefore, the more vigorously the disarmament conference is held, the more frantically the military preparations of various countries expand, and the more anxiously the League of Nations conference ponders, the more the rumors of secret Anglo-Japanese and Franco-Japanese agreements spread throughout the world. Napoleon put it well: "Before a great war, everyone lies." This is truly the most appropriate explanation of the so-called "peace" in the capitalist world.</p>
<p>Especially at present, the third phase of the capitalist economic panic has broken the balance of power among the powers, making them all feel the terror and sorrow of the imminent end. Therefore, the world is loudly shouting: "War! Only war is the way out of panic!" From such a cause-and-effect relationship, is Japan's act of aggression accidental? Is the world's wait-and-see attitude accidental? Understanding this, do we still have room to appeal to others for peace? Moreover, even if we hope for peace, it should be "upholding justice to achieve peace," and we must never "sacrifice justice for peace." For a year, we have been appealing for peace every day, as if anything can be discussed as long as we can have "peace." Frankly speaking, we do not need such peace. We believe that the establishment of "true peace" must still go through a great battle of total mobilization worldwide.</p>
<p>Winter Sketches</p>
<h3>Seasonal Climate and Superstitions</h3>
<p>— Yu Dafu</p>
<p>"Tianjia Wuxing" (Farmers' Five Elements) is a precious book for farmers in the countryside of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Some of the rules about the winter climate and superstitions are copied below.</p>
<p>Snow in December indicates a bountiful harvest in the coming year. Rain on the third day indicates prolonged overcast weather, and it will be difficult to get sunny weather in winter and spring. The third "xu" day after the Winter Solstice is the Laba Festival (according to the lunar calendar, this year's Winter Solstice is on November 25, and the third "xu" day is December 26). Three or two snowfalls before and after the Laba Festival are called "three whites before Laba," which is good for vegetables and wheat. It is said that "if you want wheat, see three whites." It is also said that "Laba snow is a bad omen, spring snow is a ghost." And also, "if you see three whites in January, the farmers will laugh heartily." If the snow stops but doesn't melt, it is called "snow waiting for a companion," indicating that there will be more snow. If there is a lot of southeast wind after Laba, it indicates a great flood in the coming year. The same is true for predicting the New Year if the Beginning of Spring (lichun) has not yet occurred.</p>
<p>December 12th is the birthday of silkworms. In Jiaxing and Huzhou, gods are worshipped on this day.</p>
<p>The 24th is called Little New Year. Families in the Wu region must worship the Kitchen God, which is said to be the meaning of bidding farewell to the kitchen. New Year's Eve should be quiet. It is recorded that if dogs do not bark on New Year's Eve, there will be no plague in the coming year. According to folklore, there are plague envoys who descend to the human world to spread plague on that night, so it is advisable to write "The plague has passed, the envoy must know" on yellow paper and post it on the door frame.</p>
<p>December is called the Great Banning Month. If there is a slightly warmer day, it is the omen of Great Cold. There is a saying, "One day with bare arms, three days of shivering."</p>
<p>The folk sayings about the climate of the nine-nine days after the Winter Solstice are: "The first nine and second nine, hands don't leave sleeves. The third nine and twenty-seven, blow the flute on the fence. The fourth nine and thirty-six, the clothes look like dew. The fifth nine and forty-five, the sun opens the door (another saying is, 'a drill or knife cannot enter the soil,' and another saying is, 'the poor man dances in the street'). The sixth nine and fifty-four, the poor boy gets his wish (another saying is, 'tender branches grow on the fence'). The seventh nine and sixty-two, carry cloth sleeves on your shoulder. The eighth nine and seventy-two, a (greasy) dog looks for a shady place. The ninth nine and eighty-one, plows and harrows all come out."</p>
<p>Calculating the seasonal climate from the Winter Solstice seems to be a habit of Eastern astronomers. In China, it is said that a hundred and six days after the Winter Solstice is Qingming (Pure Brightness), while in Japan, it is said that there will be storms on the 210th and 220th days. When the Yuan Dynasty conquered Japan, the entire army was wiped out, probably because they encountered the storm of the 210th and 220th days.</p>
<h3>Snow</h3>
<p>— Qin</p>
<p>White snow tightly presses down on the earth, and the world trembles in the cold; but, do you believe? Thick spring is already brewing within the snow.</p>
<h3>The Monkey and the Whip (Fable)</h3>
<p>— Da Ling</p>
<p>After playing in human society for a long time, a monkey returned to his old home, the barren forest of Huaguo Mountain, and brought back many things, one of which was a leather whip that he had stolen.</p>
<p>By the power of this leather whip, he conquered all the other monkeys living in this barren forest. They had to obey his will: to gather fruit for him, to fill his private treasury with gold and silver, to tidy up his bed, to prepare his drinks, to catch fleas on his body, and to fight with neighboring monkeys to protect his territory. And he, then, either sat high on a branch watching for his own amusement, or enjoyed himself hugging a very beautiful female monkey. If he was slightly displeased, he would mercilessly whip them with all his strength. They were slaves to him every day without rest.</p>
<p>Moreover, the monkey holding the whip became more and more ferocious day by day. The other monkeys did not have time to collect food for themselves. When night came, they had no choice but to endure hunger and exhaustion, collapsing randomly on the damp, muddy ground, waiting for the next day's whip and work.</p>
<p>Pain was thus spread throughout this barren forest.</p>
<p>One evening, a monkey who was too tired to die complained to his wife...</p>
<p>"As long as that rascal doesn't have the whip in his hand, he's really not scary. When the whip is still in his hand, although we feel a kind of terror and intense pain, there's no way we can't obey him!"</p>
<p>His smarter female monkey said:</p>
<p>"That rascal must not feel the terror of that ghostly whip!" Her man replied:</p>
<p>"That's what I think too, but I don't understand why."</p>
<p>The female monkey pondered for a moment, then said:</p>
<p>"Could it be because the handle of that ghostly whip is in his hand?"</p>
<p>From that day on, the smart female monkey's powerful words slowly spread among the monkeys in this barren forest. So, one day, they could no longer bear it, so they all moved together and snatched the leather whip from the ferocious monkey's hand, letting the end of the whip dance on his back.</p>
<p>In this way, the monkeys were able to spend time gathering food for themselves and live a peaceful and free life forever. There was no one to oppress them anymore. Moreover, they learned a valuable lesson from this, which is:</p>
<p>"The leather whip must be held for just purposes."</p>

<h3>Crossroads of the Times and Love (Manuscript Continued)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Ziping</p>
<p>She looked at his sleeping face again, feeling more and more that it was bewitching. Her whole body seemed to be a little hot. She suddenly had an impulse, and brought her smooth lips to his forehead. In just an instant, she moved them to Haiquan's reddish-brown lips. She smelled a kind of odor unique to men.</p>
<p>"If he suddenly sits up, it'll be terrible!"</p>
<p>She was worried about this in her mind, but in reality, she hoped that he would wake up.</p>
<p>But she was still disappointed. He only reached out from the blanket and gently wiped his lips, then turned over to the inside and continued to sleep soundly.</p>
<p>(18)</p>
<p>When Haiquan woke up from his dream, the morning light was already shining in through the window. Because Mrs. Ren had poured him a few glasses of wine last night, he felt a slight pain inside his head when he got up this morning. Seeing that it was getting late, he hurriedly put on his clothes.</p>
<p>"Mr. Lin is awake?"</p>
<p>Just as his left foot was about to go into his slippers, he heard the door of the room creak open, and Mrs. Tsuruko walked in with a smile on her face. As soon as he saw Mrs. Tsuruko, his face darkened.</p>
<p>"Oh dear, Mr. Lin is still angry! I don't know what to do!"</p>
<p>Haiquan wanted to retort to her, why was that Japanese guy still staying in this house? But on second thought, he felt that he really didn't have this right.</p>
<p>"Are you going to school today too?"</p>
<p>She stood to one side, her attitude seeming a little cautious. This made him feel a little bad.</p>
<p>"EH."</p>
<p>He only answered with this sound, and there was still no smile on his face.</p>
<p>"Mr. Lin, if you're not going to school, I'd like to accompany you to have fun outside for a day. There are also many things I want to talk to you about." Mrs. Tsuruko said with a smile.</p>
<p>"Who would accompany you Orientals out?"</p>
<p>Haiquan himself didn't understand why his attitude towards her would be so rude.</p>
<p>"Oh dear! I mean, just me alone will accompany you out!"</p>
<p>Mrs. Tsuruko looked like she was about to cry.</p>
<p>"Don't you have guests at home? You should accompany him."</p>
<p>Haiquan was afraid that she didn't know that he hated that Japanese guy, and he couldn't help but say it out loud in a high-pitched voice.</p>
<p>"Never mind him. They will sit at home, because they have just arrived in Shanghai and don't know the way to Hongkou. I took them around for two or three days, and I was exhausted and annoyed. Who still wants to take care of their affairs! Now he knows the way too. I don't want to accompany them anymore, so that people outside know I'm Japanese!..."</p>
<p>Hearing Mrs. Tsuruko say this, Haiquan couldn't help but be surprised, and at the same time he felt a little pleasure, slightly recovering his cold attitude.</p>

<p>Talk</p>
<h3>Within One Yard</h3>
<p>— Bai</p>
<p>According to the World News Agency, Rome: According to statistics, among the European countries, the Netherlands has the fewest national crimes, and among the many cities in the Netherlands, the city of Yubao, three miles east of The Hague, has almost no criminals, which has been the case for several years. This situation has attracted the attention of general criminologists, who have written many articles to explain the reason. The most obvious reason is that the moral management in Yubao City is stricter than in any other city, and morality is the main focus in families, schools, and society. Therefore, the tendency to commit crimes has been absolutely eliminated. As for the standards of morality, they are unique and noble. For example, one of the moral trainings is: "In public places, men and women may not sit side by side within one yard of each other." Goodness gracious! What a one-yard distance! We Chinese do not have crime statistics, but we probably do not have a position in the world. The old gentlemen and patriots have long been eloquently saying that people's hearts are not as good as before and morality is declining. Now that they have seen the unique and noble moral standards of Yubao City in the Netherlands, they will have a lot to say. Since Westernization, China has simply become more and more out of shape. Men and women can already walk hand in hand on the road in public; in public social occasions, men can actually hold women and dance; and women like prostitutes can actually pull men on the road. These are all enough to cause a tendency to commit crimes. Men and women sitting side by side in movie theaters and at banquets are no big deal in our country. I think this is the root of crime. Now, to prevent the moral corruption of the people and reduce national crime, we should immediately learn from the moral training of Yubao City in the Netherlands and implement the rule that men and women must not sit side by side within one yard of each other.</p>
<p>Okay, okay, if this is the case, the comrades of both sexes in the movie theater should be divided into two groups, and there should be at least one yard between them; the seats in the game field should be handled in the same way; all dance halls and male and female actors should be banned. The seats for male and female students should naturally be one yard apart. When entertaining guests, the host should also arrange the male and female seats one yard apart.</p>
<p>One-yard separation, men and women are separated. In this way, perhaps the national crime in China will also be reduced. Newspapers may not see rape and murder cases, adultery cases, suicide cases (broken hearts), theft cases (because they are poor and want to please their lovers, so they steal)... Wouldn't that be great!</p>

<h3>Attention, Frostbite Sufferers</h3>
<p>— Cheng Sen</p>
<p>In this severe winter climate where the cold wind penetrates to the bone, those who have suffered from frostbite in previous years will inevitably experience a recurrence. Initially, it resembles itching and pain, causing extreme discomfort. Once it becomes ulcerated, it is difficult to heal, and the affected area is usually between the hands and feet, making movement exceptionally painful. Although medicinal creams are sold in the market, they are rarely effective after ulceration. I have suffered from this condition for many years and have endured much pain, never being able to prevent it from ulcerating. This winter, I suffered from the condition again, and after it ruptured, movement was exceptionally painful. Although I applied medicinal creams, they were ineffective and even seemed to worsen the ulceration. Now, I have obtained a secret remedy from a close friend, and it healed within two days, with miraculous effect. Considering that there must be many sufferers of this condition, I am now making it public to readers. Those who suffer from this condition may wish to try it.</p>
<p>The ingredients are simply borneol and crab shell ash (made by charring dried crab shells over charcoal until they turn to ash). Grind equal parts of each into a powder and apply it to the affected area. It will heal in one or two days. (The medicine will form a hard crust after application. Do not peel it off, otherwise it will be painful and difficult to heal. Please pay attention to this.) All of the above has been personally tested by me and is indeed miraculously effective. Gentlemen suffering from frostbite, may wish to try it.</p>
<h3>Oral Examination</h3>
<p>— Yi Yi</p>
<p>On Saturday afternoon, a message suddenly arrived: a certain bank was recruiting trainees, and my uncle asked me to go with him to take the exam.</p>
<p>Yes, at my age—twenty-one—I needed a job, especially since I could now be considered a dropout, and my uncle was very concerned about this, so he specifically notified me to take the exam, which I naturally appreciated.</p>
<p>Although it was for a trainee position, if I could pass the exam, I thought it would be better than being unemployed. So, I felt some joy in my heart and went to take the exam.</p>
<p>When I arrived at the bank, I followed someone upstairs to the examination area. The examiner gave me a piece of paper and asked me to fill it out, which I did.</p>
<p>"Can you guarantee that you will not marry within three years?" This was one of the questions on the paper. I thought it would be impossible to guarantee this, so I wrote "Probably not" in response.</p>
<p>Then, the oral examination began. First, there was an English test. A person with slippery, rolling eyes looked at me and asked me a few questions in English. Finally, he asked if I knew their rules. I said I did not. He then gave me a copy of the trainee recruitment regulations, two of which were not in my favor: one was that applicants must be under nineteen years of age, and the other was that trainees could not marry within the three-year training period and must live in the bank's dormitory. Regarding the first point, he did not say much to me. But regarding the second, he said that I had to change the "Probably not" on my paper.</p>
<p>"Who is that person down there to you?" another examiner asked me. It was the person who had given me the paper to fill out.</p>
<p>"He is my uncle."</p>
<p>"Discuss it with him. About this marriage matter."</p>
<p>I went down and spoke to my uncle. His opinion was that I should write "Yes." I went back upstairs and had to say that I could. Although this was against my true feelings, for the sake of the two big words—livelihood—I reluctantly crossed out "Probably not" and left only "Yes."</p>
<p>"Where are you from?" the person with the slippery, rolling eyes asked me.</p>
<p>"Zhenhai, Zhejiang."</p>
<p>"People from Ningbo are mostly straightforward. How straightforward is your temper?" He said with a mocking tone because of my dull and slow-witted answer. I thought he really wanted to scold me if he wasn't being polite.</p>
<p>My temper was not very good to begin with, and I knew this myself, but I couldn't change it. At that time, because the conditions were not in my favor, my answer naturally made people even more displeased, and it was no wonder that person mocked me.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter if I lose a job, but the two big words—livelihood—are not easy to handle. Finally, I received that approval...</p>

<h3>Ascites is Not an Incurable Disease</h3>
<p>"Ascites No Worry Pill" Achieves Great Success</p>
<p>The National Medical Community Praises it Unreservedly</p>
<p>Ascites, a disease considered incurable by the Chinese medical community and for which Western medicine also lacks a cure, is typically treated only with surgical drainage, but the swelling soon returns. Therefore, only one in ten patients can be cured. Since the invention of the "Ascites No Worry Pill" by the Shanghai Zhengwei Pharmacy (west side street of Wing On Company, Nanjing Road), it has saved countless lives for over a decade. All cases of ascites, abdominal swelling, qi deficiency, women's blood swelling, and infantile malnutrition ascites have been effectively cured by this pill, leading the national medical community to recognize it as a groundbreaking miracle drug, widely recommending it. The pill's effectiveness is both significant and rapid. Mild cases can be cured with half a dose, and severe cases are guaranteed to heal with one dose. Detailed instructions are provided. Send a letter with two cents postage for details. The price is $20 per dose, $10 per half dose, and $5 per box. No additional shipping fees for out-of-town mail orders. Original return service.</p>
<h3>Miracle Frostbite Remedy</h3>
<p>Unbroken frostbite! Swelling disappears the same day</p>
<p>Ulcerated frostbite! Heals in a few days</p>
<p>Frostbite is caused by the coagulation of stagnant blood, initially presenting as redness and swelling with unbearable pain and itching. Once ulcerated, it oozes pus and becomes even more painful. This condition is especially prevalent in winter, but effective remedies are scarce, causing great suffering to patients. Now, our local Zhengwei Pharmacy (west side street of Wing On Company, Nanjing Road) has invented two miraculous remedies: (1) "Pearl Jade Cream," used to treat ulcerated frostbite, removing the necrotic tissue, promoting new tissue growth, and providing rapid healing; (2) "Frostbite Wish-Fulfilling Water," used to treat unbroken frostbite, immediately stopping pain and itching, and quickly reducing redness and swelling. The prices are extremely low: "Pearl Jade Cream" is only $0.40 per box, and "Frostbite Wish-Fulfilling Water" is $0.20 per bottle, $2.00 per dozen. Wholesale prices are particularly low. For out-of-town mail orders, add $0.20 for postage.</p>
<h3>Words of a Young Mistress</h3>
<p>— Wen Bing</p>
<p>A few days ago, at a friend's house, I happened to meet several modern young mistresses. They began by chatting casually about the difficulties and feelings of friendships. Then, the conversation turned to comparing life before and after marriage. Finally, they discussed the arguments and conflicts between husband and wife.</p>
<p>According to them, it is difficult to say for sure whether life before or after marriage is better. Life before marriage is full of carefree ease, and the world deep in one's heart is entirely beautified and poetic. After marriage, however, things are clearly different. Although one has a sense of belonging in both material and spiritual terms, there is inevitably some sense of ordinariness. In short, life before marriage is a life of illusion, while life after marriage is reality. Although life certainly requires reality, the young mistresses cannot help but feel a little lost. Alas, the passing of youth is, after all, a flaw in life, and I worried about them.</p>
<p>Speaking of husband and wife, even with the most intense love, some quarrels are inevitable.</p>
<p>Young Mistress C, speaking with a strong Suzhou accent, said, "I argue with ×× (referring to her husband) almost every day. The reasons are often trivial. For example, when debating a certain issue, we both stick to our opinions and cannot reach a decision. Afterwards, he always has to say, 'Today, my reasoning was correct.' That really infuriates me, and then another argument breaks out. Once, before lunch, my mother-in-law had to go out and asked me to take care of the vegetables cooking on the stove. I was being very careful, but alas, a gold-rimmed vegetable bowl slipped and shattered on the ground. I was extremely flustered. He came over and actually laughed, which made me feel so indescribably angry that I couldn't help but vent my anger on him, and then a big fight ensued."</p>
<p>Next, Young Mistress S, with a thoroughly Shanghai manner, said, "What I dislike most about Mr. ×× (referring to her husband) is that he never says anything, no matter what you say. He is always silent. Sometimes, even when I am wrong, he still doesn't say a word, which is the most infuriating thing. Once, it was during a dinner party, and my mother-in-law asked me to get four silver plates. Unexpectedly, I dropped one and broke off a foot. I was so frightened that my heart jumped and my lips turned white. I asked him to quickly take it to a silversmith to fix it, so my mother-in-law wouldn't say that the young mistress was no good. He said it didn't matter. I got angry and scolded him, and he actually got angry too, and then a big fight broke out."</p>
<p>Then, Young Mistress K, from Ningbo, said, "Speaking of ×× (referring to her husband), he never easily lets me go out to play by myself. He always wants me to accompany him. He is from Beijing, and he wants me to learn Mandarin. After tea and meals, if I can't learn it, he gets angry. Usually, I am able to be patient, but he always likes to pursue things to the point where I can't take it anymore, and then there's a fight. Once, it was early in the morning, around ten o'clock, when his friend came to see him. He had something to do, so he asked me to go downstairs to greet him. At the time, I was busy getting ready, so I was a little slow. He actually stopped working and went to greet him himself. Naturally, I felt a little annoyed, and then a pointless fight broke out."</p>
<p>These are the words of modern young mistresses. Readers, please take note.</p>
<h3>Before New Year's Day</h3>
<p>— Ouyang Jinping</p>
<p>Wen Su-ying was a naive and carefree girl who, unfortunately, developed a gambling habit at the age of seventeen: mahjong, poker, flower cards, pai gow—she excelled at them all. The knowledge she had gained from her studies over the years was wasted as a result. Sadly, she had no luck: she lost every time she gambled and accumulated a mountain of debt. It was as if the saying, "A woman who gambles will be impoverished her whole life," had come true.</p>
<p>It was the night before New Year's Day. Outside, snowflakes were falling, creating a silver world of powdered jade. Su-ying, in the midst of her gambling frenzy, hoped to win a hundred or two hundred dollars within two days so that she could celebrate the New Year properly. But things didn't go as she wished; she even lost the ten dollars her fiancé had given her for New Year's expenses. Distraught, she couldn't sleep all night. Finally, the day of the Lunar New Year arrived. Every family was preparing New Year's dishes and feasts, but Su-ying could only sigh and say: If I hadn't gambled so much, I wouldn't be in such trouble today! As she spoke, she angrily braved the rain and snow and went to her good friend Xiu-zhi's house, begging her to borrow ten dollars to get through the New Year. Although Xiu-zhi despised Su-ying in her heart, she still remembered the joy of their past companionship and couldn't bear to see her suffer. She also remembered Su-ying's demeanor when she studied Chinese history, her aspirations to follow in the footsteps of Hua Mulan and Qin Liangyu. But in such a short time, Su-ying had fallen into the whirlpool of a wicked society, addicted to gambling. It was truly a pity! So she said to her, "Sister Su-ying, if you need something, I will do my best to help,</p>
<p>One week anniversary Japanese printing Complimentary January 28, 1933 JANUARY 28</p>
<p>, but in extravagant Shanghai, money should be used wisely!" Su-ying nodded repeatedly and was about to leave when Xiu-zhi asked her to stay for dinner. During the meal, she offered some words of encouragement,</p>
<p>Truly, classmates have an obligation to advise each other.</p>
<p>Su-ying thanked her, left Xiu-zhi's house, and headed straight back. On the way, she passed a large gambling den and was invited inside for a chat by a girlfriend. Due to days of excessive gambling, Su-ying was now exhausted and listless. Coupled with not having slept the night before, she drifted off to sleep. She was clutching a ten-dollar bill in her hand and unknowingly dropped it onto the gambling table. The group of gamblers, in high spirits, thought she had bet on that hand. But the dealer, who was losing every round and was feeling irritable, didn't notice Su-ying's flushed face. Before long, the ten dollars on that hand, with added bets, totaled more than a hundred dollars.</p>
<p>A commotion woke Su-ying, and her girlfriend said to her, "Congratulations! You're very lucky!" Su-ying shook her head, confused. Her girlfriend continued, "Didn't you just bet ten dollars on that hand and then fall asleep? Look, you won!" Su-ying suddenly understood and realized that she had always lost when she gambled, but today she had unintentionally won big. She suddenly felt that fate was predetermined and that wealth could not be forced.</p>
<p>Looking up casually, she saw a Buddhist image hanging on the front of the gambling den. Illuminated by the electric lights, the words "Lay down your butcher knife and become a Buddha on the spot!" were clearly visible. Su-ying was moved to her core, and her true nature was revealed. She immediately collected the money from the table, abruptly left the gambling den, went to a bank, and asked the clerk to donate the hundred dollars to the Northeastern Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army.</p>
<p>Crackers sounded, and the first day of the New Year had arrived. Good for you, enlightened Su-ying!</p>
<h3>Two Noodle Shops</h3>
<p>— Tang Qianjian</p>
<p>Today is Sunday again, and the huge school building is deserted like a mountain. I sat alone in my small room, and those sad past events came to my mind one by one like a movie being projected before my eyes. Ah! As for my current wandering and the bleakness of my future, I really don't have the courage to think about it. I stood up aimlessly and slowly walked out of the school gate. A cold wind blew in my face, and I felt a slight chill, but in the lovely and warm winter sunshine, it didn't feel piercingly cold. I walked towards the few withered willow trees across from the school gate, which had been stripped bare by the harsh winter winds and frost. Suddenly, I looked up and saw in a Wang's noodle shop across the street, hot steam billowing out from under the pot lid, and the aroma of spareribs being fried in the oil pot, which could be smelled even across the street. The shop was already crowded with students from our school, and the sounds of laughter, noodle slurping, and the waiter's responses mingled together. Two seventeen- or eighteen-year-old waiters, their sleeves rolled up high, with glistening beads of sweat on their foreheads, were running back and forth non-stop. Their business was really good, with customers leaving and new ones entering. I stared blankly, and suddenly I remembered that in the spring of this year, next to the willow trees where I was standing, there was also a noodle shop with a bamboo shed. At that time, the green willows provided shade, covering the top of the bamboo shed, and the tender green willow catkins, like the long sleeves of ancient beauties we see in paintings, danced gracefully in the spring breeze. At that time, I also sat comfortably in the bamboo shed eating noodles. On the surface, I knew that they were competing with Wang's noodle shop, and everyone was using their means to attract customers. For example, the bamboo shed noodle shop sold noodles for fifteen copper coins a bowl, and spareribs for twelve copper coins a piece. Then Wang's shop would sell each item for one copper coin less and would also divide the noodles into many varieties to cater to the tastes of customers. As a result, the students all ran to Wang's noodle shop to eat, and before long, the bamboo shed noodle shop closed down because it had too little capital, poor business, and could not compete with Wang's noodle shop. Now the bamboo fence has also been torn down, and the willow trees have withered, leaving only a few branches shivering in the cold wind. Beside the tree, on a square of ground, several withered willow branches were scattered in disarray, like the dead silence of a graveyard. Ah! I remembered this competition, and I sighed that the whole world is full of bloody struggles. Countries and individuals are constantly struggling at all times, whether directly or indirectly, they must struggle to survive. People admire and admire Wang's noodle shop as a winner in the competition, but who would pity the bamboo shed noodle shop that was eliminated!</p>

<h3>A Good Opportunity to Break Off an Engagement</h3>
<p>Mr. Editor:</p>
<p>Since losing my kind and gentle father, I had to leave my mother and siblings for the sake of putting food on the table and came to work as a small clerk in a shop. My monthly income is barely enough to sustain my life.</p>
<p>As I got older, my mother and brothers, driven by the idea that "a man should marry when he comes of age," invariably brought up the issue of my marriage. I initially refused a few times, but eventually, "it's hard to disobey a mother's orders," so I acquiesced. Soon, I received a photo of her, which was considered an expression of our engagement.</p>
<p>Alas! In these times, personal lives are already precarious, so where would I find the strength to bear the expenses of marriage and the costs that come after? However, since I had already expressed my approval of this engagement, it seemed inevitable. Morally, I already had a responsibility to seek happiness for this woman I had never met. So, I mustered my courage and worked hard, hoping to gain a better position and solve this pressing economic problem. As a result, I thought I had succeeded perfectly, which I cannot help but attribute to the excitement that the engagement gave me!</p>
<p>Time flew by like an arrow, and more than a year passed since our engagement. But strangely, there was no news at all! I wondered if she...? After several inquiries, I finally understood: her heart had changed, and the engagement had been dissolved without a word. My hometown, a large station on the Shanghai-Tai Line in Baoshan County, had already been dominated by materialism. She was probably at the forefront of fashion, embracing modernity, right? It's only right that a poor man like me is looked down upon.</p>
<p>My mother and brothers, initially afraid of breaking my heart, kept it from me. But fire cannot be contained in paper, and eventually the truth had to come out. She, who loves wealth and despises poverty, now wants to reclaim the original photo! Should I give it to her? No! Why did she give it to me in the first place?</p>
<p>Mr. Editor, my heart is shattered. Please tell me what to do. I will be immensely grateful. Sincerely,</p>
<p>Zhao Xueyuan</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Zhao's marriage was originally conceded to "mother's orders." According to the letter, his personal finances were not yet stable and he lacked the ability to bear all the expenses of marriage and beyond. Moreover, the other party is a materialistic woman! One must know that women who worship money, neglect learning and moral cultivation, and focus solely on modernizing their appearance are most worthy of contempt. Zhao is unfortunate to be engaged to such a woman, so even if the other party does not propose to break off the engagement, he should take the initiative. Now that the other party has made the proposal, he can simply go with the flow and resolve the matter completely: why worry so much? Finally, I must sincerely tell Zhao that when dealing with a vile person, one must always stand on legal grounds. The issue of dissolving the engagement must first come from the other party's mouth, and he must obtain proper documentation; otherwise, the other party may pretend to be a hooligan and make unreasonable demands. When we encounter despicable villains, we should try to enlighten them. Even if we cannot, we should be forgiving in every way and avoid being petty, which would only damage our own character. Zhao should simply deal with this matter, not confront it, to show his magnanimity.</p>

<h3>Sympathizers (Continued from Seventeen)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>On the third day, Wang Ersao packed a bag of things and went back to her parents' home. It was fifteen li from her in-laws' house to her parents' home, and Wang Laoer planned to push her there in a small cart, but she said it wasn't necessary, that she could walk slowly and arrive in half a day. Wang Laoer thought she was being considerate and didn't pay attention. But from that day on, Meng Guobao also stopped coming to his house to chat. Later, he learned that he had gone to the provincial capital. Four days passed, and Wang Ersaozi still hadn't returned home, so Wang Laoer pushed a small cart to his parents-in-law's house to pick her up. When he asked at his parents-in-law's house, they said she hadn't come home. Wang Laoer didn't believe it at first, but after asking everyone in the village, they all said they hadn't seen her. Only then did he realize that the pot-stirrer was gone. The pot-stirrer had never had any evil intentions and had never been on good terms with any men, so how could she disappear? This was truly strange. He thought of the pot-stirrer's oval face, long eyelashes, black eyes, black hair, and doughy arms, and he really couldn't bear it. After returning home, he cried bitterly twice. Some people suspected that Mr. Meng San had kidnapped her, but after thinking carefully, it didn't seem likely. First, Mr. San was most sympathetic to farmers and even more sympathetic to Wang Laoer. Second, he was a foreign student from the city, so how could he kidnap a villager, and one who was already married? Third, he and Wang Ersaozi hadn't had any obvious relationship that anyone had seen, and Wang Ersao wasn't a three- or two-year-old child who would run off with someone after a few words. These didn't seem likely, so he couldn't say for sure that Mr. Meng San had kidnapped her. Wang Laoer also said that Mr. Meng San had said that he sympathized with me the most and wouldn't kidnap my woman. Even if he did, would a villager like me dare to go to the city to find him? If I wanted to file a lawsuit, my father had fought a lawsuit that wiped out our family's fortune, and I wouldn't do that. With his statement, the matter was glossed over. But a month later, someone wrote a field song about him, which went:</p>
<p>Sixteen-year-old pot-stirrer knows how to run the house,</p>
<p>City gentleman takes a fancy to her.</p>
<p>City beauties are rouge and powder,</p>
<p>Village beauties are water peach blossoms!</p>
<p>Water peach blossoms, good for the city scholar to pick!</p>
<p>Villagers pick flowers to go back to the muddy fields,</p>
<p>City people pick flowers to put in vases.</p>
<p>This flower is not of this world,</p>
<p>How can you match her with a winter melon?</p>
<p>Match her with a winter melon, that's a big joke!</p>
<p>On the green rice paddies, the seedlings had grown to over two feet tall and were producing rice ears. Wang Laoer still worked in the fields every day, but no one brought him tea or tobacco, and he couldn't sing. People sang, but he just listened blankly. The villagers didn't pity him, and they even sang songs to ridicule him. The only one who showed sympathy, Mr. Meng San, was gone again. In the vast universe, who was Wang Laoer's sympathizer?</p>

<h3>Future Trends in American Film Industry</h3>
<p>— Shen</p>
<p>The emergence of sound films is one of the biggest reasons for the decline in sales of American films.</p>
<p>The first thing that sound films examine is dialogue. The crux of the plot is expressed through dialogue, and the ups and downs of the plot are also developed through dialogue. If you give a viewer who does not understand the language to watch it, all they will see is a few people talking, laughing, or even crying in one scene, and in another scene, a few figures resembling villains are conspiring in a sneaky way. They can only rely on the synopsis provided by the theater to guess at the actions on the screen.</p>
<p>Silent films also have subtitles to represent dialogue, but they cannot simply stare at a face without expression, or show a mouth opening and closing repeatedly on the screen. They also have writing, and there is also the crux of the plot, but it is expressed through action. We have seen the German film by Emil Jannings without a single line of dialogue, but we have never seen a silent film with as many as five hundred and eighty-odd lines of dialogue, like a typical sound film. If you have ever roughly counted the subtitles in a silent film, at most it is only one hundred and twenty or thirty lines; even though Chaplin's "A Woman of Paris" is no less than ten reels long, it has fewer than sixty lines of subtitles. The same "viewing," perhaps with the same lack of knowledge of foreign languages, at least we can enjoy three times the appreciation in the "viewing" sensation.</p>
<p>"Film is becoming theatricalized," sound films cannot escape this judgment!</p>
<p>Last year, we mentioned that a few American filmmakers, in addition to producing copies in German and French, were considering producing copies in Chinese. In the end, because the total income from China was feared to be insufficient to cover the cost of production, it ultimately became a moon in the water.</p>
<p>Now, there is another piece of good news:</p>
<p>Lasky, the former production manager at Paramount, has vowed to thoroughly reform the style of sound films and enter a new garden beyond the study of dialogue. He said, "To restore the past prosperity of the film industry and revitalize its future glory, we must strive to maintain the silence of silent art, use a small number of dialogues, express the director's talent through the actions of the actors' faces.</p>
<p>This great filmmaker has now joined Fox, hiring many silent film directors and screenwriters to work on their new projects. We anticipate that "success" will certainly not refuse their advances.</p>

<h3>Best Films of Late 1932</h3>
<p>— Guo Shenghong</p>
<p>According to a lengthy article published in a prominent position by the Shanghai Continental Daily yesterday (the 13th), concerning the best films of late 1932, based on letters from outside audiences, the names of the best films and their leading actors are revealed as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Smilin' Through - Starring Norma Shearer and Fredric March (2) Tarzan the Ape Man - Starring Johnny Weissmuller</p>
<p>(3) The Merry Widow - Starring Maurice Chevalier and Jeanette MacDonald</p>
<p>(4) Frankenstein - Starring Boris Karloff</p>
<p>(5) The Champ - Starring Wallace Beery and Jackie Cooper</p>
<p>As for why "The Yellow Ticket" was not selected, it was because the film was not welcomed by the majority of the local audience, but only by the entire Russian community in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Furthermore, "Mata Hari," which was once banned by the film censorship board, is a masterpiece crystallized by Greta Garbo and Ramon Novarro and received favorable reviews from a portion of the local audience. In addition, Garbo's portrayal of the female spy Mata Hari in this film shares the same name as a once extremely popular Japanese actress, which made the Japanese proud. Therefore, it was eliminated like "The Yellow Ticket."</p>

<h3>Questioning Movie Audiences</h3>
<p>— Zhen Nian</p>
<p>Why can't you sit still and watch in the movie theater? You are always disturbing and affecting the sight and hearing of others.</p>
<p>You constantly move your bodies, as if you can't sit still, as if there are bedbugs biting you on the chair? You also constantly move your head to the left and right to talk to your friends.</p>
<p>You must know that every time you move, those sitting directly behind you have to move with you. Is there an end to this kind of movement?</p>
<p>When you enter a theater, you stand in the aisle arguing about where to sit, not realizing that your voices are too loud and obstructing traffic.</p>
<p>When the music starts, do you like to tap your shoe soles on the floor? If all the audience in the theater did the same as you, wouldn't it be too lively?</p>
<p>When the actors make funny moves, you laugh out loud as if no one else is around. If someone wants to hear what the actors are saying, they are disturbed by you.</p>
<p>You think you have read the novel of this movie and talk about it endlessly to your companions, your voice getting louder and louder. People in the three or four rows in front, behind, left, and right can't hear the movie. But you should be careful, you might be booed off by them and be filled with shame.</p>
<p>Also, most of you watch with cigarettes in your mouths, you should exhale the smoke upwards. If it goes astray and is sprayed out, someone sitting in the front row will feel a cold breeze on their head, followed by a pungent and unbearable smell of smoke. Don't be annoying, don't be Theater Pests.</p>
<h3>From Stage to Screen (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Hong Wei</p>
<p>Performing on stage is different from performing on screen. People with stage experience are not necessarily good at screen performance, but people with stage experience are ultimately better than those with no performance experience at all. Therefore, many film actors, both Chinese and foreign, come from the stage.</p>
<p>Chinese stage plays can be broadly divided into three types: old opera (referring to Peking opera; as for Cantonese opera, Kun opera, Yue opera, Yangzhou opera, etc., they are not widely popular, and the talent pool is also limited), new opera (commonly known as "civilized drama"), and spoken drama (spoken drama and new opera seem to have little difference in form, but in new opera, the actors only need to not lose the original meaning and can improvise freely, while in spoken drama, they must follow the script, without adding or subtracting a single word). Among Peking opera actors who have officially joined the film industry, only Yuan Meiyun, the lead actress in Tianyi's sound film "Little Actress," can be counted. As for Mei Lanfang's "Assassinating the Tiger General" and Xue Yanqin and Tan Fuying's recent "Si Lang Visits His Mother," they are both bringing Peking opera to the screen, and are of a temporary nature, so they cannot be said to have joined the film industry. Cantonese opera actors who have appeared on screen include Xue Juexian and Tang Xueqing, who filmed "Platinum Dragon."</p>
<p>New opera actors make up the majority of those who have joined the film industry, such as Zheng Zhegu, Ouyang Yuqian, Lin Yongrong, and Jin Yuru in the past, and Zhang Zhenduo, Ma Dongwu, Gao Lihen, Qin Haha, Xiao Zhengzhong, Wei Pengfei, Tan Zhiyuan, and Chen Qiufeng today, all of whom are new opera actors.</p>
<p>In recent years, many spoken drama actors have also invaded the film industry, including men such as Jin Yan, Zheng Junli, and Tang Huaiqiu, and women such as Hu Ping, Ai Xia, Wang Ying, Ye Qiuxin, and Cang Yinqiu. Now, let's talk about a few female spoken drama actors who have gone from stage to screen:</p>
<p>Hu Ping She is from Changsha, Hunan. She once joined the South China Drama Society, but did not perform there. Later, she joined the Dadao Drama Society and gradually began to emerge. Her first foray into the film industry was in the Youlian Company's "Hero of the Sea." Later, she joined the Baihong Film Company, founded by Chen Yitang and others, and starred in "An Affair in the Garden." However, these two films were martial arts films without any substance, so they were not noticed. Last year, she joined the Star Film Company and took on the role of an actor in "The Revival of the National Soul." Later, she also starred in "Love and Life." The publicity in the newspapers was very lively, but after the film was released, it did not achieve any amazing results. She is very knowledgeable and can write scripts. It is recently heard that she is engaged in studying English.</p>
<p>Ai Xia She was born in Beiping, but her ancestral home is not Beiping. She once joined the Drama Association, organized by Ying Yunwei, Hong Shen, Li Hua, and others. She writes a beautiful hand and is as knowledgeable as Hu Ping. Her entry into the film industry began when she joined the Tianyi Company and revealed a glimpse of her talent in "The Amusement Fair." Later, she joined the Star Film Company and played the lead role in "Old Hatred and New Sorrow." Her performance was also just average, perhaps due to her first time on camera. She and Hu Ping share the same shortcomings, which is that "talent" and "beauty" cannot be combined.</p>
<h3>American Stars and the Legal Net</h3>
<p>— Hong Sun</p>
<p>Victor McLaglen forgot to pay his medical bill of $300 and was sued by the doctor.</p>
<p>Swanson purchased many exquisite pieces of furniture but was slow to pay for them. The debt collector was prepared to resort to the law, so Swanson quickly paid back $7,500. Only then did she escape the ruthless legal net.</p>
<p>Although Loup Vroom's health is gradually improving, his finances are in dire straits. He stated in court that he was unable to pay off a debt of $82.</p>
<p>Colman sued Samuel Goldwyn for destroying some items that he had spent millions of dollars to create and demanded compensation of $2 million.</p>
<p>Last summer, Tom Mix met a painter. The painter asked him to sit for a portrait, but forgot to mention that there would be a charge. It was only after the painting was finished that he asked Tom for $1,500 for the portrait. Tom firmly refused to pay, and the result was also a lawsuit.</p>
<h3>The Story of the "Match King" (8)</h3>
<p>— Xi Mengze</p>
<p>In Germany, Paul Kruger encountered a new experience. It was the first time in his life that he felt his heart racing. This was different from fighting for power and profit, it had a different flavor. Who was his opponent? It was a German movie star named Martha Murna (this is probably alluding to the romance between Swedish star Greta Garbo and Match King Krueger). She awakened Paul's world of dreams and turned them into dreams of love. But the dreams of love were never fulfilled in Paul's life.</p>
<p>Paul's skills were unparalleled, but Murna always remained aloof and difficult to subdue. One day, Paul invited Murna to his private residence for dinner. He specially sent her a string of exquisite gold bangles and diamond necklaces. He thought that Murna would definitely not refuse, so he ordered that a grand feast be prepared in his secret room. Vases were filled with precious camellias, silver buckets were filled with ice for champagne, and waiters dressed in bright costumes were waiting quietly for the arrival of that heavenly angel. But that angel never arrived.</p>
<p>He waited and waited, but she didn't come. The scheduled time had passed by an hour. Paul called Murna's hotel to ask, and they said that Murna had already left. Paul rearranged the table, the flowers in the vases withered, so he replaced them with fresh ones. The ice in the ice bucket melted, so he added more ice. The flowers withered again, and the ice melted again. Paul called again to ask, and the other line said that Miss Murna had left on a long journey three hours ago.</p>
<p>"Didn't you just say that she had already left to come here?" Paul questioned him irritably.</p>
<p>"Sir, Miss Murna instructed me to say that before she left," said the other end. "No, Miss Murna did not leave a mailing address."</p>
<p>Paul Kruger laughed coldly and hung up the phone. He thought to himself that he had always gotten everything he wanted in the world, and had never failed once. Today, he was being played by a woman, and he couldn't help but feel a little disappointed. But he never admitted defeat.</p>
<p>One afternoon, Paul Kruger was at the entrance of a small inn in Innsbrook when he happened to see Murna coming out. She was wearing travel clothes. When she saw him, she felt a little uneasy, but there was no way to avoid him.</p>
<p>"Ah, Miss Murna, how fortunate I am today to meet you here," Paul said softly. "I am Paul Kruger." He said his own name, not to introduce himself, but to show a kind of self-confidence, which was to show that Paul Kruger was not an ordinary person and could not be trifled with.</p>
<p>"Yes, I know," Murna replied casually.</p>
<p>"Are you going for a walk? Can I come along?"</p>
<p>She hesitated again, and finally said with a smile, "Of course."</p>
