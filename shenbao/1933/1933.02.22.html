<h3>日軍大舉犯熱聲中國聯大會昨日開幕</h3>
<p>主席希孟正式宣布調解失敗經過</p>
<p>延會至星期五討論報告書</p>
<p>俾各國政府得有充分研究</p>
<p>十九特委會繼大會開會</p>
<p>着手組織十國談判委會</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　國聯大會今日下午三時三刻開會、主席希孟報告中日糾紛之發展、及十九國委員會調解之失敗後大會即延會至星期五（二十四日）再開、討論報告書草案俾各國政府得有充分時間研究報告書後將應取態度訓令其在日内瓦之代表、（二十一日中央社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　今日國聯大會、主席希孟致辭明言調解失敗由於日本之不示讓步、希孟致辭畢即散會中日代表均未有機會發言、日本一再揚言退盟、據此間觀察以爲日本現尚在徘徊却顧中、不致即宣告退出、（二十一日中央社電）　　（日内瓦）　近來國聯開會討論中日衝突時、旁觀席中輒無虚位、今日午後亦復如是、在國聯大會未開會時、新聞記者及一般注意遠東時局者皆早已入塲覓隙而坐、主席希孟宣佈開會時、全塲肅然無聲、會塲中人除抱國發現製造歷史之感想外、尚有不少煩慮、第二衆覺十九特委會之報告書並未應付各種可能的事變、故希望從會塲中獲取可、彌補此罅隙之辦法第二、衆覺現仍有大規模戰事之可能、今晨日方來文作熱河及他處大戰或將爆發之警告、此尤人人所難忘懷者、開會以前、會都頗似電影攝影塲開末拉等攝影機置於四隅以攝取登塲人物之照片、大會於午後三時三刻開幕攝影旣畢、鈴聲即作會議從此開始、議程之第一事項、爲推舉　森國際難民救濟會主任之問題、繼討論中日問題、希孟追述十二月九日國聯大會所給予之訓令、及十九特委會所繕具之草議案、及理由説明書渠以爲國聯大會旣須有全塲一致連有關係之兩造在内之表决、若未先得中日兩國政府之同意遽以草案提交大會、實與事無益希孟繼稱、兩國代表對此草議案皆提議修正、日本且建議根本上之改變因是丨九特委會欲提出可得滿塲一致同意之草議案、將在感困難、惟特委會欲對於兩造、尤其對於日本、予以必要時間、以研究此問題、並提出新建議、乃决定休會至一月十六日、以便繼續商榷、雖在一月初旬日本佔據山海關、並有進佔熱河之説、時局乃愈臻嚴重、然行委會猶决計稍待、而不欲遽認上月之努力已歸失敗、一月十八日日本之提議不獨爲中國所不能承認、亦爲特委會所不能接、受但特委會仍與日本開始新談話、而以日本新提議爲根據希望如日本所反對者、僅爲非國聯會員國之加入調解委員、會則特委員當商諸兩造、而謀解决此問題云、希孟至此乃追述此後對日之談判、及對中國所提修正案之研究、謂經此談判與研究後、特委會斷定中國與特委會對於邀請美俄兩國之重視、决不許特委會依照日本提議之意旨、於修改草議案其他條欵後、再將邀請美俄一條删去特委會後遂草擬此報告書、蓋以唯國聯大會始有援用盟約第十五條第四節之資格也、特委會鑒於日本對於特委會所詢［滿洲國］現狀不爲解决法一問之復文性質、乃不得已認爲特委會已竭盡其調解之可能的努力、此爲國聯今日所遇之事態、調解努力進行已十七個月矣、當事變之初、日本曾向行政院保障日軍已開台撤退至鐵路區域、一俟日人生命財産之安全有保障時、即迅速撤盡、今日東三省已被佔據矣、日軍已越長城而攻擊榆關矣、進攻熱河之軍事準備、亦在進行中矣、依照盟約第十五條第四節、調解手續非至國聯通　報告書後、不能結束、惟余不願遽作志在調解之請求、因此種請求不獨須有國聯抟可接受之新提議、且須有時局之不可增重·新軍事行動不能進行之保障而後可、余現不欲提議吾人應於今日即研究此報告書、因在此重要關鍵、吾人必不可作草率行事之形式也、余因各國政府必須有充分時間以其訓令發至日内瓦、故提議展至二月二十四日開始討論此報告書、主席此議爲衆所接受、國聯大會乃休會至星期五日、大會散會後、十九特委會立即開會、以便徴集願參加談判委員會者之同意、俾可將其國名列入報告書中、旋議定此項委員會以十會員國組成之、即德·意·法·英·西班牙·愛爾蘭·捷克·加拿大·葡萄牙·荷蘭是也、特委會决定星期四日再行集議、討論手續問題、並决定關於報告書之通過、不宜發何議論、希望如是可於星期五日晚間完成國聯大會之手續、（二十一日路透電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　據種種徴象觀之、國聯大會之次會議、將在手續與結果上有類似革命之舉動、因此次祗有行爲而無言論、與以前國聯會議逈不相同也、明日會議、將僅僅聽取十九特委會主席希孟關於特委會辦事經過之報告、此外未必有人演説、一俟會衆舉定南森國際救濟難民局主任、以繼胡白職後大會即將休會、俾會衆得詳細研究此報告書、希孟所須言者、多已見於報告書之歷史數章中、故希孟子約費二三十分鐘即可畢其詞希孟定將言及談判、説明調解如何失敗、雖如何措詞今尚未悉、但料希孟所舉調解失敗之理由將不止一端、調解之門今猶開啓、俟大會切實通過報告書後、此門始閉、在星期五日之國聯大會中、松岡與顏惠慶定將各發言論、他國代表在最後時期或亦有發言者、但在目前、則除中日兩國總代表外、迄未有人表示願發言也、關於代表國聯大會監視時局特别委員會之組織、今尚無甚進行、如兩造之一不接受、而談判委員會不能召集、則此特别委員會即須組成之如中國不再進一步、請求援用盟約第丨六章、則此報告書將有天然壽終之可能性乎、抑國聯大會仍自然與聞此爭議乎、此乃待商法學家之事件、召集談判委員會之機關或將稍有變更、以期談判委員會於談判未能實現時集會討論、此亦非不可能事也、（二十日）路透社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　今日各代表間已開始一種運動、其目的在限制星期二國聯大會中之演説、俾國聯之通過十九國委員會建議可以更顯效力、目下已有八委員國同意限制其演説、祇理述事實、且必力求簡短蓋認國聯大會若能立刻採用建議、毫無評論、將可表示各國站在一條陣綫也、關於十九國委員會之繼續問題、今日小國方面答辯數大國之結束主張、以爲國聯盟約中旣無禁止委派團體對於任何爭執觀察事變之明文、故委派十九國委員會完全合法、而十九國委員會之繼續存在亦完全合法</p>
<p>今日已商定國聯大會中發表主席宣言之後、即當畀中日代表立　發言之機會、昨有某小國代表逆料六個月内即將對日援用盟約第十六欵、但今日遍叩各代表意見、則贊同此語者絕少、大多數代表即對於究否將援用第十六欵、亦不欲予以保證、（二十一日國民電）</p>
<h3>八小國代表秘密會至深夜</h3>
<p>主張特委會仍繼續存在</p>
<p>英代表向本國政府請訓</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　八小國代表由西班牙瑪達利亞、加領袖、昨夜九時三十分在布格旅館開秘密會議、討論中日爭執直至午夜以後始散、據聞曾一致决定國聯於票决採用十九國委員會報告與建議後、必須繼續開會、並須授權十九國委員會觀察今後之事態、因滿洲時局、尤其熱河時局之進展、有立加注意之必要故也、當八國代表會議至十一時、曾邀國聯大會主席希孟前往出席、逆料希氏受八代表論辯之影響、在今日下午發表之主席宣言中、極有勸大會及十九國委員會繼續縝密觀察中日爭執之可能、（二十一日國民電）</p>
<h3>美禁軍火出口</h3>
<p>實際爲對日有力經濟封鎖</p>
<p>胡佛促國會立卽授權實施</p>
<p>（華盛頓）　美總統胡佛今日突然行文國會、請即禁止軍火運售交戰國家、謂渠信此舉有益於國内經濟之復蘇、蓋渠顯然感覺遠東有發生戰爭之虞、而南美國家又衝突不已、俱大足以阻滯經濟之恢復也、按胡佛前曾向國會提案、授權總統商得各國合作後、禁運軍火至交戰國、當經兩院通過、今復有此單獨禁止之提議、足見局勢之嚴重、故頗引起外間之評論、（二）十一日國民電</p>
<p>紐約訊、據日内瓦消息、國聯將商請羅斯福氏於其就任總統後、使美國與國聯合作、在九國條約及凱洛格非戰公約之旗幟之下、美國之合作似無甚問題、國務阮對此、迄今取避閃態度、據稱未有任何國以合作説來商者、至美方是否允許合作、將依提議之性質爲斷云云、同時史汀生似在竭力運動各國致發起阻日本輸入軍火、藉以促進其不承認［滿洲國］之政策、美禁軍火出口案已通過兩院、當時衆院對於此案之意見原分贊否兩派贊派所持見解有如下之五點、（一）此案爲第一實際的步驟、藉以實現法代表馬西里在國聯提出之不與［滿洲國］合作案、（二）禁軍火出口案之實施不必引起反抗日本之印象、（三）［軍火］一詞、可作戰時違禁品解、若列强願欲、可將棉花及礦物包括在内、如是則禁軍火出口、不啻一種有力的對日經濟封鎖、而予日本以一致命的打擊、（四）列强遲疑於宣布對日抵制、今代以禁軍火出口、爲一種最簡單最有力的致成和平之手段、（五）關於美國之合作以致成遠東爭適之解决、禁軍火出口爲最合理的及建設的方法、國務院雖正式宣言此案係爲南美而設然該院確在準備會同國聯施行其遠東政策云、（世界社）</p>

<p>史汀生準備親自赴歐</p>
<p>（華盛頓）　當此日本或將退出國聯之際、美政對於滿洲時局應否發表聲明一層今日參院外交委會各委員大都主張關　　（日内瓦）　關於小國力謀國聯大會採用報告與建議後、暫不解用十九國委員會一舉、聞英外次艾登將商諸本國政府、（二）十一日國民電）</p>
<p>日内瓦今日日代表團致國聯一文、附以地圖、詳言熱河與華北之華軍集中點、指此爲甚大危險、並謂日本有援助［滿洲國］以禦外侮之義務、查熱河境内有華兵十四萬四千人、長城之南又有兵三十三萬人、一旦開戰、日本不願進兵於長城之南、除非華軍動作迫令日軍爲戰略理由致有此舉耳云云（二十一日路透電）愼重、據稱、大多數委員之態度、認美國旣非會員國、此時尚不宜表示任何態度、或作任何行動、但若美僑在華權利受有妨碍、則美政府將有行動、又聞國務院對於國聯時局應否發表宣言一層、亦採取同樣態度、以爲至少在國聯大會表决報告書與建議以前、不宜有所聲明、但即在國聯大會表决以後、美政府究竟有無宣言此時亦尚未决定、此間重要人物有認日本决定退出國聯後、則此世界和平機關雖可認爲獲得精神之勝利、而在技術方面實告失敗、目下雖無人欲諱言目前緊張局勢或將擴大至太平洋全區者、但亦信世界聯合輿論、或能避免散播紛擾至滿洲以外某地、官塲方面則有數人信日本所説之國家安全線將僅限於向熱河猛烈進攻者、並信中國因國内軍隊之一致向外、及得國聯精神上之贊助、將盡力抵抗、但亦以爲日本在舉世反對之下、、甚難信其軍事行動將圖逾越熱河以外者、並希望精神上之孤立、將可拘束日本勿爲更廣大之軍事行動、目料日後日本財政上之困難、定將促其改變態度、接受他國之努力、覓一和平解决方法云、（國民）電）</p>
<p>華盛頓訊、美國官塲對於中日問題、極度沈默、惟史汀牛氏對於國聯大會將派遣之中日爭端談判委員會、有接到請柬即開始協力之决意則爲明顯之事實、史氏與下屆之羅斯福政府關於此層、當予以維持實現共同戰綫、史氏在國聯作明確之行動前、保留論評、但官塲認日本或將退出國聯、預測遠東　然之戰爭、將波及美日關係之新危機、表示極度悲觀又史氏接受國聯請柬後、將先與下屆羅斯福總統一度討論云、（世界社）</p>
<p>戰債問題促進</p>
<p>英美聯合制日</p>
<p>英願以新加坡供美海軍用</p>
<p>紐約訊、紐約太陽報倫敦電訊、預料今日正由蘇桑浦敦起程赴美之駐華府英大使林德賽爵士、將向美國務院作若干影響深遠之提議、第、一英國將向美國提供以新加坡海軍根據地、作美海軍之用、於此點、該電訊力説關於滿洲問題之是英國對日本態度、最近已經一種急劇之變更、蓋英國以爲日本舉動太覺過分、恐不免引起中日戰爭、果爾則英國不復能再袖手旁觀、據太陽報通信員之意、英國對於切願維持其太平洋霸權之美國、予以一種可藉以制止日本之事物、則不但可於戰　問題獲得好條件、并可於下屆世界經濟會議中得一較優之地位、此外預料林德賽大使將提議訂一多邊的空軍軍縮條約、包括美法英德波蘭及他國在内、至英國對於關税問題之態度、該通信員謂英願對美國輸英貨物减少進口税一千六百萬鎊、同時勸美取消戰債一年一萬七千萬元云、（世界社）</p>
<h3>日海軍籌備大秋操視美爲假想敵</h3>
<p>（東京）　日本當局準備於本年八月間、在太平洋中委任統治各島附近、舉行海軍演習、其規模異常重大、參加演習者、將有軍艦二百艘、演習經費定爲六百萬日圓、此項大操目的、在試騐太平洋委任統治各島在戰略上之價值、新式萬噸巡洋艦之戰鬥力、空軍及潛水變之效力、目下已在佐伯灣作初　演習、參加演習之海軍、於七月間即可準備就緒、俟八月二十日、並假擬敵國海軍飛機、進攻東京灣、以覘東京防空設備之價值、海軍省某代表最近宣言、美國如欲日本放棄太平洋委任統治各島、則日本海軍當局、必當有以應付之、然則日本海軍大操所選地點、即在各島附近、其中自有深意存焉（二十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（巴黎）　李頓勲爵今日在巴黎和平俱樂部作驚人演説謂日本似未與西方政治思想或政治行爲之最近發展同時並進、日本雖已設立一種民治政體、但其海陸軍仍組織於封建基礎之上、而其海陸軍領袖雖有閣員不義然屬獨立、而僅對政府負責、其效能固無疑問、但其參謀部之態度、乃一八七○年至一九一四年普魯士邦參謀部之態度、觀於過去十八個月之日人行爲、日人在滿之現有態度、似爲　八九五年在南非發起著名哲木生　攻者之態度、最近十年來、歐洲政治思想已大改變、幾與一八六○年至一九○○年日本之改變相似、國際關係現爲國聯盟約與非戰公約所支配、一國不復可任意施行專謀本國利益之舉動、各國參謀部今日不獨須受本國政府之節制、且須服從國際條約所載之義務、此種事項、似日本尚未充分了解之日本旣未了解之、於乃造成遠東今日危局云、李頓繼言及不席莫洛託夫在集會農塲代表大會演説、今日始行發表内稱戰爭之危險依然存在、但蘇聯已有良好之武装、準備抵抗犯境者、我輩必不可亦不能在不知不覺中受人襲擊、按莫氏地位等於他國之國務總理、乃其演説曾力言某鄰拒訂不侵犯條約之重要、致蘇聯近日不得不集中能力於製造軍械與子彈、莫氏此語雖未明言何國、但意指日本、甚爲明瞭、其最後結語又宣稱、設有第二次干涉蘇聯之舉、則在彼帝國主義者方面其結局當未必如第一次之簡單、按第一次干涉係指歐戰後出兵西伯利亞而言（二十日國民社電）　松岡改途返國</p>

<p>時評</p>
<p>日軍攻熱與我們的總動員穗</p>
<p>（一）總動員反抗日帝國主義者日帝國主義者已於晨總攻熱河了。這是繼續九一八事變而後侵略行爲的擴大。也是我民族最緊迫最嚴重的時機。</p>
<p>當九一八事變發動之初。我們便堅决地主張要制止日帝國主義者的侵略行爲。便只有堅决地樹起反抗日帝國主義的大旗。展開民族革命鬥爭的戰線。以血的爭鬥。答復日帝國主義的侵略。以血的爭鬥。維護我民族的自由生存。</p>
<p>目前由於國聯十九國委員會的報告書。日本朝野。又一致高呼［退出國］</p>
<p>聯。］同時對我熱河總攻。我們該怎樣應付當前嚴重的局面呢。當然。唯一的辦法。是全國總動員。發動反抗日帝國主義者的民族革命戰爭。　總動員。只有總動員的抗爭。才是我們民族的出路。在目前。我們的口號。應該是以總動員的抗爭答復總動員的侵略。</p>
<p>（二）日本早已總動員了</p>
<p>自從九一八事變爆發。實際上日本即已全國總動員。最顯明的是本年度預算的加速膨脹這種預算的。目的實爲軍事的設備。賽璐珞工塲及肥料工塲都改爲火藥爆藥工塲了曹達工塲都改爲毒瓦斯工塲了。鐘錶工塲。都改爲砲彈工塲了。橡皮套鞋工塲。都改爲氣球製造塲了。白銅及鉛製品工塲。都改爲小鎗工塲了。人造絲製品工塲。都改爲飛機漆料上用的皮厝工塲了。總之一切的［和平生産工業。］都改爲］戰時生産工業］了。這是工業的總動員。在戰鬥人員方面。雖説目前現役兵只有三十餘萬。。但其他後備軍。在鄉軍人。青年團。青年訓練所。消防隊等的系統訓練。都早已開始了。這是戰鬥人員的總動員。在太平洋島嶼中日本正秘密建築軍港。在樺太豐原新瀉等地方正計劃建築大飛行塲。廣島忠海毒瓦斯工塲。與北九州一帶實施防空設備。日鮮滿防空綱業已佈置。其他如長途汽車道路的敷設與改築。如台北與馬尼剌間的無綫電的聯絡。如朝鮮國境附近清津港至敦賀航運的開拓。凡此設備。無一不足以證明日本早已實施軍事行動的總動員。　即以這次攻熱而言。實際上日本也早已總動員了。日本共有陸軍十七師團。　最近集中於熱邊的。有熊本第六師團。弘前第八師團。字都宮第十四師團。旭川第十四混成旅團。習志野第一騎兵旅團。此外還</p>
<p>有姬路上師團及龍山廿師團。散在東北各地。日本以這樣重大的軍力。集中熱邊。事實上亦已明白證明其對熱攻擊。早已實施總動員　爲了侵略。日帝國主義者是老早已經總動員了。我們呢爲了抗强暴。爲了　爭生存。再不總動員。等待何時。</p>
<p>（三）總動員中幾個重要問題</p>
<p>在總動員之先。這裏陳列着幾個重要問題。　第一。我們認定只有全民族一致團結。一致行動才能發生出偉力。假若此　一部分動員。彼一部分觀望。甚且予以牽制。這是力的抵銷。這是無組織的現　象。這種現象。在當前情勢之下。絕不應有。我們在當前總動員一口號之下。應該發動全民族的偉力。作一致的堅决的抗爭。</p>
<p>第二我們認定只有在充分的自由。充分活動機會之下。民衆才能發揮其偉力。同時也只有全國民衆一致奮起。才能充實民族革命爭鬥的實力才能爭得最後的勝利在當前情勢之下。政府應絕對信賴人民與人民打成一片予人民以充分的自由。使每人都得有參加民族革命爭鬥的機會。這樣爭鬥才能持久。這樣才眞能動員全民族。</p>
<p>第三。我們認定在總動員一口號之下。一切經濟工業交通糧食等。都應有整個的調度計。劃換言之。即都應置於軍事管理之下。特别是工業部門。此時即應停止一切奢侈品及和平生産品的製造。努力於各種軍需品的生産。史達林本年一月在共産黨大會上報告五年計劃的成績中有一段話。［惟有人曾謂吾等如擱起此工業政策。而以半部之投資。生産或輸入衣料靴鞋羊毛皮棉等日常必需品。則生活當更善。不知吾等。有了衣料鞭鞋等吾等即全無防禦力。而無新式防禦物。一國即不免成爲外敵武力侵略之目的物。與目前之中國相同。］史達林的演説。是很夠我們深長思慮的。這就是説。在當前非常情勢之下。人民都應該節衣縮食。减低平常的生活。一切活動都應該以民族鬥爭爲目的。民族革命戰爭。才是一切活動的中心目標。</p>
<p>（四）打倒卑怯苟安的心理</p>
<p>也許還有人説。［忍耐罷。戰爭是没有把握的。］也許還有人説。［忍耐罷。戰爭將使我們的犧牲更大。］也許還有人説。［讓我們生聚敎訓後。再來復。仇雪恥罷。一這都是卑怯苟安的心理。這都是誤國的主張。此種心理。我們堅决反對。</p>
<p>我們問。忍耐是否比戰爭更有把握。生聚敎訓。究竟等到何年。九一八以來。不抵抗的犧牲。比抗爭還大。我們爲什麽不抵抗。我們還有讓的餘地嗎。還有苟安的時間嗎。</p>
<p>宋子文代院長日前告前敵將士書中曾説。［强盜臨門。惟一的生路是武力自衛。置之死地而後生。我們拚死。才是唯一的生路。］眞的。在目前只有拚死。才是我們民族唯一的生路</p>
<p>我們堅决地反對傳統的畏怯苟安的心理。我們高呼總員反抗日帝國主義者。</p>

<p>景春寫給我不告而别的景鸞</p>
<p>姊姊</p>
<p>景鸞姊姊：你臨走給我的信，我讀了心痛如割！心血似的涙流滿了紙上，回家一看父母親已痕得不成樣子，父親悲痛像要瘋狂了！樓上下亂跑，一會大吵大鬧，一會又自言自話，母親整天哭泣，吐病又發了，兩老廢寢忘餐，米精疲乏已不支，整天還痴痴呆呆，聽着門響，想你回來，一聽皮鞋聲，就張望望，當你回來了，失望後又痛哭一陣，你臨走衣物一樣没有帶，母親哭着告訴我怕你凍病，更不知你現在已漂泊何處？受什麽痛苦？可憐我的姊姊！你在受罪吧？你也在悲痛想家吧？你説出外求學，一個弱女子在外能不受人的欺騙嗎？就是等你學成有了出頭的日子，多病的老親，還安然在世嗎？唉！老親要有點什麽，可憐你的弟妹也不能生存！姊姊！你忍心爲你一人求出路，犧牲了許多人的生命嗎？弟妹整天的哭，可憐他們弱小的心也因你碎了！	現在只希望能得你一封平安的信，也可减少老親的悲痛，稍安老親的心，你一封信，可救許多人的命，你快快寫信回來，姊姊！你稍慈心，憐憫我們罷，我們家裘，除掉舊式大家庭處處略　東縛之外，此外家人團聚，圍爐談話，種種家庭之樂，樣樣都有，你在外就會感覺到外間是不能有這種快樂的，你現在要是已經有了這種感覺，你快點回家，家中父母親一定不責罰你糊塗的過失，弟妹們亦决不會笑你的，老親帶你到這樣大也是不容易的，往日你有病，父親母親總是加意的愛護你，你的身體向來不好，能受得起外間的風霜嗎！萬一病了，誰管佝尼？你想想死去的三娘，也一定在地下悲泣憐憫你了，三娘一生最愛你，現在見你颿流在外，能不飲泣九泉嗎，你曉得平日不喜歡你的人們，他們每日譏笑着，諷剌着，使母親更加剌心難受，你何苦吏愛你的人心碎，使不愛你的人暗笑呢，我泣求你來信聲明，你離家的原因，也好讓母親弟妹安心，你不想父母親和弟妹嗎？你願意一家一整天整夜哭泣坐臥不安嗎？父母親現在也許可你自由在外求學或做事，决不强迫你回來，因爲你多病，所以希望得你一封平安信，我們眞是十萬分誠心，以涙來祈禱你的好消息，喲姊姊！我許願只要你能回來，我把我的血來寫扁，掛在神前，你平常同我説的話，都很明白，你也知道老親是最慈愛的，　們姊妹，就是老親第二生命，你忽然離家，不是要斷送了老親的命嗎？姊姊！你從頭細細的想想罷！，就回來能，不要再强抝到底，要曉得你的動機，雖然不是壞念，但是根本還是錯誤的，你不要執迷不悟，一個飄泊無家的孤人，寫在詩詞廟面，用些虚構悲哀的文字，似乎頑警動人，要是身當其境，是很苦的事怀，姊姊！你不要幻想了，我這字字都是涙同心血寫成的，想來你看了，一定會動心的，姊姊！我的心碎了，蠢笨不善言的我，無言可以表示我們的悲痛，我眞是呼天不應啊，姊姊！我只希望這信你能看見，祝你平安，你的妹妹景春泣上讀者顧問</p>
<p>宗敎信仰自由問題</p>
<p>丨甘君來訊丨</p>
<p>本月十三日貴報讀者顧問欄内載有復姜信女士一函，其中對於宗敎有所不滿，而尤不滿於佛敎。某亦佛敎徒之一，不能不爲之表白。竊思人民一律平等，宗敎信仰自由，業已載明約法，而對於廟壇寺觀公然侮辱者處刑，亦有專章，誠以各宗敎義，莫不以勸善改惡爲指歸，以明心復性爲究竟，足以補法律政治之不逮。是以東門各國政府，對於各宗敎，無不竭力護持，且有規定以佛敎爲國敎者，其用意誠深遠矣。查佛敎　漢明帝時流人中國，迄今二千餘載，高僧輩出，爲十天夫所景仰，史册所載，班班可考。其敎以受持殺，盜，淫，妄，酒，五戒爲基礎，以捨身救世爲主義，不殺卽仁，不盗卽義，不淫卽禮，不妄卽信，不飲酒卽智，與　敎五常相合。昔宋文帝謂可尚之曰：［若使率土之濱，皆感佛化，可以坐致太平。夫百家之鄉，十人持五戒，則十人淳謹，千室之邑，百人持五戒，則百人和睦，持以風敎，以周寰區，編戶億千，則仁人百萬。且人能行一善，則去一惡，去一惡，則息一刑，一刑息於家，萬刑息於國，天下何憂不治乎？］然此之效果，猶指持戒言之，若夫大乘菩薩，則上求佛道以自利，下化衆生以利他，有大根，具大智，信大敎，妥大理，修大行，求大果，難行能行，難捨能捨，難忍能忍，抱擒已利他主義，積極救世，逈非小乘厭世消極，祗圖　利者所可比儗。惟是降及近代，敎徒日衆，間有不守戒律之儔，然未可以一二人之故，而　及全體，亦如卜子不肖，未可歸咎於孔敎也。　者國府通令全國，對於各宗敎，均應有相當敬意，用意深厚。責報主持輿論，領導羣流，尚望注意及此。</p>
<p>覆：賜函殷殷埀敎，對於本欄答復姜信女士一信中各點多所糾正，備見愛護本欄之至意，拜謝！拜謝！拜謝！本欄所有信件，都係另請專家代爲答復，關於姜信女士來信　提出之問題，答復者因本身懷疑宗敎，故其所言如此。其實宗敎信仰，完全爲個人受用，尤其佛敎之影響社會，有若來信所陳述者，固亦至大。初未容以某一人之言論，否定一切，抑其宗敎固有之價值，亦斷非某一人所能否定也。茲謹尊重賜敎之至意，將大函披露，藉資讀者比較參閲，并資糾正。本問題之討論，亦就一結束。</p>
<p>啓事：讀者諸君來信，務必具備本欄規定手續：（一）開明姓名年齡性别籍貫住址職業：（二）附足回信郵票：（三）貼用本欄通信印花：此節已於本欄再聲明。乃近日讀者諸君來函，仍多不依照上開手續辦理，尤以不開明通訊地址，及不附足回信郵票爲最多。擱置不復，旣覺辜負埀問之誠，通融作答，事實上又諸多困難。茲特再鄭重聲明：以後來信，務請按照規定手續辦理，否則恕不作復。前此手續未備函件，如於一星期内未來信補正，仍當分别作答。此啓。</p>

<h3>打贏家</h3>
<p>— 囒</p>
<p>贏了！贏了丨丨是個馬夫在那裏呐喊。</p>
<p>馬夫　養的一匹駿馬，被偷馬的偷夫了；馬夫不甘心，在公現先生面前去呼喊。一次，無效，兩次，無效，待到最後一次，得到了公理先生的公判，證明這匹駿馬磷乎是馬夫　養的東西，除却證明以外，再也不能有進一步的援助，然而，馬夫已高呼着贏了，這呌做輸的匹馬，贏的一句話。</p>
<p>贏了！贏了！丨是一個奕者在那裏呐喊。</p>
<p>奕者和人對奕，那人是毛手毛脚的，乘着奕者劃火點紙烟的間隙，竟把東北　上奕者的活棋提去了一大塊；奕者不甘心，請公理先生下公判。公理先生費了許多方法，好容易證明這塊活棋確乎是被人偷去的；旣經證明以後，要想恢復棋枰的原狀，公理先生以爲是不可能的了。然而奕者已高呼着贏了，這呌做輸的一角棋枰，贏的一個虚名</p>
<p>贏了！贏了！丨是一個飯店老闆在那裏呐喊。</p>
<p>飯店老闆的一隻紅燒醬蹄子，被路過的惡丐搶去了，放在嘴邊咀嚼：老闆和惡丐理倫，惡丐説：［這隻蹄子是一步一步走到我手裏來的。老闆逄人呼號：［</p>
<p>天下能有會得走的紅燒醬蹄子？旁人聽了都不來理會，最後一位公理先生證明這隻蹄子確乎不是自已走到惡丐那邊去的，若奪回這隻仁被咀爵的蹄子，要看老闆的能力如何？然而，老闆已高呼着贏了贏了，這呌做輪的一隻蹄子，贏的一些面子。</p>
<p>以上三件事，輸的，是現實的，贏的，是空虚的，然而，受公判的强徒，不敢和公理先生頑抗，却來尋着這虚有其名的贏家，　拳擦掌聲勢淘湧的大喊着打贏家！打贏家！</p>
<h3>兩性</h3>
<p>— 司晨</p>
<p>丨關於男女間的種種丨</p>
<p>兩性，就是指男女。社會的改良與進步，全憑兩性的合作與創造。所以平常不説起這花花世界則已，説起這花花世界來終離不了要提到［男男女女］這四個字的。</p>
<p>從前我們中國古老時候。一向有［重男輕女［的習慣，那個時候完全是男性中心社會的時代。可是也有例外，比方如長恨歌裏面就有［不重生另重生女［的句語，兵車行裏面也提到過［信知生男［惡，反是生女好］的那番話頭，這且莫去管它。因爲本來［天生男女］，是要呌他們夫唱婦隨偕老百年的，正不必一定要去閙甚麽［重男輕女］或［重女輕男］。俗語有句老話，呌［男大當婚，女大當嫁］，這所謂［大］原本有個標準的，你看［男子三十而娶，女子二十而嫁一，不就是指這個麽？不過輓近以來，大約男女的互相結合，是以雙方愛情的成熟與否爲準繩的，年齡的限制，一般人恐怕也未必去注意到哩。</p>
<p>［男子是泥做的，女子是水做的］所以用［着水欲溶］這句話來形容男子之遇女子是最恰當的。</p>
<p>［男子主外，女子主内］，古有明訓，現在一般人却在［男女平權］的題目下還高喊提高女權，於是女子職業便在這個時候提倡起來了，但是我們可不能不顧慮到，如果將來眞的有一日男女同時主了外的話，那末又叫誰去主內呢，這不是一個很費解索的難題嗎？</p>
<p>］飲食男女，人之大欲存焉］，這話是不錯的，至於［男女有别］，和［男女授受不親［這兩句話曥應該從字裏行間把它廢棄才是，因爲男女除了有生理上的差别之外，其他從種種方面早已證明了［男女無别］，何况方今社交旣公開戀愛又自由，是則所謂［男女授受不親［者，蓋早已名存實亡。</p>
<p>話説完了，最後，願天下［紅男綠女］萬勿于［男扮女装］或［女扮男装］以致弄得［男不像男，女不像女］，務一本［男女合演］的初旨，共同創造出一部驚人傑作來。</p>
<h3>復活的角翅</h3>
<p>— 龍騷</p>
<p>在雪亮的燈光下，各人的臉全紅了。酒味充滿了這大的餐室。四面包圍著的語浪，像霧一樣的密集着，可是不久，寗波恃者很快地端上這麽大盆的魚翅，熱氣冒得厲害，繼着主人來敬酒了。再繼着，筷頭如雨點，再後，盆底向天；使我的心就不自主的跳了一下。我是袖手旁觀着。説我絕對是個愛國主義者倒也未必，不過覺得，魚翅從東三省失守後，國中義士，好像竭力宣傳廢除過，而且各菜館也自動將存貨封存了。那時有二個理由：（一）魚翅大半是貨，應該排除；（二）縱非日貨，價格太貴，而没有多大滋味，儘可取消。現在似乎日本兵並離開東在省，而且正在謀取所謂［東四省］，但咱們國中義士，旣不耐煩絕食魚翅，各種館子也似乎不便久封，於是在請客席上，又回復了一盆［大菜］！正不知這些原料是九一八以後封存的呢？是新從日本來的？還是一部份大老以謂廣東出産的呢？然而，難道現在吃的價錢不貴嗎？滋味突然變好嗎？所以不［儘可取銷］嗎？</p>

<h3>青春之火</h3>
<p>— 顧明道</p>
<p>伊也只得立起問道：［凱哥你忘記什麽］凱君遂遂又説過昨大一個朋友約我今天下午三時在茶寮中有些事情談談的，不知怎樣的我忽然忘懷了。此時已過三點鐘，［馬上要去哩。］於是凱君用着這個急智，方得解脱了脂粉的包圍。結果雖然出去空走了一趟，可是比較方纔的情形平安得多了。</p>
<p>他經過了這一回，覺得此地不能再居了。伊的青春之火已竟在那裏燃燒，而向自已包圍，種種意想不到的魔力，也許要繼續着向他攻擊，那麽任自已的心弦怎樣堅硬，也禁不起這種情綿綿的彈弄，意切切的激剌，不得不早想擺脱之計，免得誤人誤已，造成罪惡。他究竟是個舊頭腦的人物，不願在這狂潮慾海中追逐，而要學那古時的魯男子，讓人家駡他一聲麻木無情，於是他等他母親回家後，把這事告訴了，母子二人商量一番，决定在急促的日期中遷居，然而豈是他的始願呢？</p>
<p>自從他遷家以後，伊也不來補習了，自然而然的疏冷。他雖覺得對於伊，似乎有些不情，使伊也很難堪，可是除了這個辦法，也没有再好的了。時光如流，一年一年的過去，轉瞬已是二三年。凱君雖然把這事漸漸淡忘，可是有時一想到那粉紅色的絲帶和伊暈紅的兩頰，心裏止不佳還有些跳盪呢。這一天，恰逢凱君有事赴滬，當火車到了滬站，凱君下了車，走出站去時，忽在月台上碰見迎面有一對男女，並肩走來。女的穿着大衣，一頭雲髮燙得波紋般的蜷曲，很是摩登。到得近身，忽然那女的瞧見了凱君，對他點點頭，臉上微微紅頳。凱君仔細相視，認得正是數年不見的伊。此時二人没有説話，凱君也祗回頭點了一下，已挿肩過却了。又見那男的提了一隻皮篋，偎着伊，十分親密，好似一對伉儷。凱君暗想莫非伊已有了歸宿麽？倘然是的，也未嘗不是一件較妥的事，但是心裏仍有疑惑。</p>
<p>後來凱君聞得伊果然再醮了，心中也很安慰。自言自語道：［但願如此，那麽這青春之火不致成爲葬身毒熖了。然而世間尚有許多青春之火正在燃着呢·（完　）</p>
<h3>隔壁的小丫頭</h3>
<p>— 紫霧</p>
<p>丨倘若伊是一個小姐丨</p>
<p>［軋得，軋得，］每天早上我聽着隔壁的小丫頭拉着風箱。因爲節拍的單調，往往使我的靈魂跟隨著這聲音引到另一個世界去。</p>
<p>伊在拉風箱的時候，往往從伊没有訓練過的而却很焥妙地哼着曲子的音帶裏發出來，伊也跟着時代跑，能唱普通一股流行的歌曲，像小小畫家之類，並且也有時摹仿着男人的高音而總脱不了女人低音的唱着歌，［三民主義····貫澈始終］。</p>
<p>伊受了人家的委曲，就嚎啕的大哭一陣，［唔唔唔唔，你，不是人啦，呀····一，時常聽得伊還抽噎未停的當兒·大概又有誰説了俏皮話，伊隨着哈哈唔··哈，呀，晤，哈哈哈的大笑起來。有一天，伊把一張青天白日滿地紅，紅裏有四條綠色波紋的中國海寛旗黏在窗格子上，伊的緋紅的頰，紅得像旗上的紅色一樣可愛，伊還小，大概祗十有二歲吧，一對也能藐視人的眼瞳人黑得正和伊自已的髮眉相稱，···啊，假如伊是我的妹妹，我的妹妹去年已經出嫁了，不，伊简直比我妹妹更美麗更純樸些。</p>
<p>没有搬到這裏來住之前，隔壁的一個女孩子，使我記起來，伊每天早上彈出柔和得像春日的陽光一樣的曲調，［丁東，丁東］，的令人感到不再想做工作，晚上有人駛摩托卡來接伊去跳舞的，我也曾見過伊，伊的頭髮蓬鬆得眞像伊的生活的凌亂無序，伊傲視一切，但伊每天不能不在　最看不起的每天僕婦們在倒馬桶猶帶餘臭的後門口出進。</p>
<p>倘若隔壁的小丫頭像從前隔壁的一個女孩子一樣是一個小姐，那麽，伊還能［軋得，軋得］的拉着風箱，哼着曲調，很自然地哭笑着麽？呵，小丫頭小姐。</p>
<p>風土小誌</p>
<h3>普陀山傳戒一瞥</h3>
<p>— 火明</p>
<p>普陀山普濟禪寺，從前天起，舉行并壇傳戒，寳華山的法師，在那兒開堂，陪堂，行禮。聚集了十方的和尚尼姑與壇那弟子，禮拜五十三天，學習毘尼。這是一個極大的盛會。記得三年前旅行南海時，在佛頂山上鑒賞過這種傳戒儀節··</p>
<p>是秋天的九月中旬，從法雨寺　巉道上爬去，不久，以觀音　著名的佛頂山峯，就落入眼裏了。慧濟寺的山門把我吞了進去。</p>
<p>文殊騎著青獅，普賢跨着白像，左右擁住了如來的大雄寳殿上，這時滿擠了皂袍，　裟，和瓜一樣的人頭。霧一般的烟，烟裏的香氣，簡直浩漫成海，使人睜不開眼。</p>
<p>大約危坐在如來像前的高臺上的和尚，是慧濟寺請來的剃頭師了。兩邊又立着兩個和尚，左是［首座］，右是［維那］。他俩正在一問一答的説些熟練過的習語。據説就是如來考問弟子戒律的一種扮演。</p>
<p>繼着，行列在殿上的和尚尼姑們，被剃頭師傅的剃刀，把俗世的髮絲剃掉了大半，還　留一小部份。於是法壇上的高僧便開始講經了。漸漸提出三項問題：（一）你願意别你的塵世嗎？（二）你願意别你的爺娘妻子嗎？（三）你願意别你的自已的肉軀嗎？如果大家不爲這悽慘的音調所感動，他便拿起利刀來把留　的髮也全給剃盡了。然而這時候，因爲山中特别沉寂，每人又投入更深的夢裏，於是毫無聲音在反抗，在逃避太慘的環境。</p>
<p>這魔着，高僧便拿出紅紙包，一包是擣爛的棗泥，一包是棒香燒殘的香信，（就是殘香的）頭，長一米突，）一共九粒。由另一　和尚拿棗泥先給每一個被傳戒者秃頭上搓成扁圓形的東西膏住了，再把每段香信挿在棗泥的中心。光景很像是放在白氈上的九顆莩薺。於是鐘鼓與磬響起來了，許多頭上膏有莩磬的和尚與尼姑們，全合十了手，向殿卜繞圈兒走，這呌做［迴向［，嘴裏儘死唱着：［南無本師番迦牟尼佛！聲音潮一樣嗡噥，［銅打銅打銅］的金革之昔附和着，一板一擊的澈響的木魚，非常呆木的敲着。</p>
<p>大約圍繞了若干時候，依舊恢復了被傳戒者的行列，不過是呌他們跪在蒲團上了。嚇，這時候，才呌人驚動魂魄呢！世界上最偉大的殉道者的行爲。</p>
<p>瞧，那另一個和尚手裏不是揑着燃紅了的俸香嗎？而且把燃紅了的棒香上的火，引燒到被傳戒者頭上膏着的香信上去了，容易燃燒的香信也赤紅了，連棗泥了燒起來了：這熱的火星，這紅的火星，漸漸灼進秃光的頭顱底髮皮裏去了！怎麽不會覺得痛？你想。看吓，每一個和尚尼姑雙脚在地上跳，怒蹬，他們一定灼痛了心，一定麻木了神經，然而他們確依舊在作佛號，愈喻愈急，愈急聲音却急低了。這時候，滿殿的皮鼓，銅鐘，木魚，馨都大聲的狂吼了起來！這晚秋午後的山峯上，全籠在悲哀而又雄壯的情調裏。而且香和烟騰騰地形容着説不出的苦悶。</p>
<p>總之，我遠遠站在大雌寳殿的台階上，起初用好奇來鑑賞的眼，現在是流着涙了。起初用趣味逗引着意識的心，現在是碎了。爲甚麽要一個好好的頭顱，受這苦難呢？</p>
<p>［苦難］是宗敎家獻身的最崇高的精神，　迦牟尼入地獄，以色列王釘十抵架，但總使人不會愉快：雖然這出世的人格偉大得很。</p>

<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份市面呈初平繼穩之象以洋麥報價、曾回　四八分不等、開價時人心曾見疲軟惟至　盤、本月份因客帮抽進、遠期各月份業　亦有進意、故各盤交易雖未暢、亦氣則較良好也、迨至下午開盤各月份市面、又見盤落、因匯率日鬆、澳麥之　售、又見活動、各廠合定一船、價祇二兩五錢、日日來前定之洋麥、已陸續進口二二船、正在駁卸、因此人心轉疲、賣氣亦稍盛、結果本月份較前日未動、三月份小一分四月份小匕釐半、五月份小一分、六月份小七釐半、七月份小五釐云、</p>

<h3>健康的禮讚</h3>
<p>— 侍桁</p>
<p>在一本關於蘇俄的雜誌的封面上，印着一個蘇俄的少女的面影：那面孔上没有什麽特色，祗是顯示着一種特殊的健康：但同有旁的東西更能比這少女的面影表示出蘇俄的特色了。</p>
<p>充滿着新的血液的健康，是現今蘇俄的最六的特色。</p>
<p>人類是漸漸地老了，隨着老必然地帶來了裘弱和疾病：可怕的不是人類的肉體的病苦，可怕的是人類的心靈的殘疾，因爲世界的誤謬的發展，環境造成人類生活的墮落，無法醫治的病苦，每日地在蔓延，今日整個的世界，就好如一架活屍，好如一個祗是在等待着死亡耗盡了精力的衰弱瘠瘦的老人。在每一個國度的大城市裏，你都可以看見一種同同樣不可醫治的病症，在巴黎，在維也納，在紐約，在柏林，在東京，在上海·····生長在這些獰惡的巨獸之中的人類，尋不到健康的工作，更尋不到健康的娛樂。從誕生到死亡，不同的命運把人類分成了等級：有的命中注定應該享受酒，美人與歌舞，他們没有工作，他們無需工作：有的命中注定應以血汗來生存，他們必要工作，因此他們就不能不生存在剥削裏。生存在被人剥削的生活之中的人們，是没有適當的娱樂好講的，然而没有娛樂人類是不能生存，於是同類的而是更下等的一種酒，美人與歌舞，麻醉了他們，使他們暫時地忘掉了他們的生活，忘掉了他們的苦惱，使他們興奮，使他們麻木。在任何一個大城市裏，在那惡魔張開了眼的世界中，你時常可以看見一個被剥削的勞動者，因爲飲着了酒，踉蹌着脚步，哭着，喊着，駡詈着，同時回應着這哭喊，你可以聽見那在附近的咖啡店中，跳舞塲裏，狂歡的管絃樂，狂歡的男女的呌嚷。再没有甚麽悲慘的光景，比這更動人的了！</p>
<p>現今的人類的生活，是肉慾，是醉酒，是極度興奮之後的悲鳴。在任何惡魔的城市裏，你尋不到一個健康面孔，所有的面孔都是焦黄的，瘦瘠的，張着兩隻獰惡伯人的閃着獸慾的光的眼，他們没有生命，没有前途，已經站在死亡綫上了！</p>
<p>有什麽方法挽救這不可避免的滅亡呢？丨貫注新的血液，播種健康的種子呀，像那偉大的斯拉夫種族正在努力工作着的！</p>
<p>讓我們禮讚健康吧！</p>
<h3>愚蠢的答覆</h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>前日各報載蕭伯訥在孫宅的談話，有一段：</p>
<p>蕭問丨我有一件事，不很明白。我是一個寫劇本的人，知道舞台上做戲的時候，觀衆是需要静聽的。爲什麽中國的劇塲反喜歡把大鑼大鼓大打大擂起來，難道中國的觀衆是喜歡在熱鬧中聽戲嗎？若使呌英國的小孩子聽了，一定會發驚瘋的。梅蘭芳丨中國戲也有静的，譬如崑劇，從頭到底是不用鑼鼓的。我覺得這個回答太蠢了。假如蕭伯訥問一句：［爲付麽中國人的臉色是黄的？］豈不是梅蘭芳要回答：［中國人的臉色也有白的，即如我梅蘭芳。嗎？］藝術的形式，必然受物質環境的决定，資本主義的都市藝術鑑賞者，對於反映農村社會的藝術，時常不能了角：蕭伯訥因此要問爲什麽中國的劇塲反喜歡把大鑼大鼓大打大擂起來。芥川龍之介也有過這種疑問：［中國戲劇的第一種特色，是樂器的嘈雜在想像以上。</p>
<p>我在起初未胃聽慣，除了用兩手把耳掩住，總是坐不牢的。］（中國游記）中國劇塲的大鑼大鼓大打大擂，確是崑曲以後的事：崑曲和以前的北曲，弦索西廂一樣，還是客廳裏的戲曲，用不着大鑼大鼓。這種戲曲，一送到田野廣塲中，聲音太低太静便不合大衆的觀聽了，大打大擋，正是田野廣塲的實際需要，丨不到中國内地農村去聽戲，不會懂得中國戲的鑼鼓好處的。</p>
<p>日本曾有過一個批評家説：［中國戲是大敲，大呌，大跳，使看客頭昏腦眩，很不適於劇塲：但若在野外廣塲，遠遠的聽起來看起來，自有他的風致。］　見明白中國戲曲的農村背景的未始無其人：梅蘭芳以扮演中國戲劇的名伶，回答這樣牛頭不對馬嘴的話，眞使人歎息。</p>
<p>正確而聰明的答覆，應該説：者</p>
<p>大鑼大鼓的使用，正適合中國農村的劇塲，喧擾的缺點，在都市的劇塲中才顯露出來，在農村的劇塲只顯出他的優點，蕭先生，請你到中國内地去聽一回戲罷？］</p>
<h3>内河小火輪</h3>
<p>— 彭雪珍女士</p>
<p>乘内河小火輪是我近兩年來的新的經騐，這味兒是夠有趣的。</p>
<p>從蘇州開往Ｔ鎭的小火輪，據説在設備速度各方面都是比較進步的。但只要你的頭一探進船艙，第一個剌激腦神經的便是嘈雜和混亂。小販們提着盛滿了香烟橘子糖果等等的籃子呼喊站，但喊的聲音儘管高，伸出手來買的却不多見，乘客們凝着眸子，很耐性地聽他們的充滿着希望的呌喊。</p>
<p>照例是小販們讓步，大廉價得甚至打對折。</p>
<p>［賠本賣了呢，先生丨］一　苦笑的臉對你説。</p>
<p>買的人漸多，他們不想到小販們對於生活的掙扎，却説他們做買賣太不老實。</p>
<p>船將開，小販們被驅逐上岸，難得有兩個是提着空籃笑臉盈盈的。</p>
<p>船開了，艙裏便只是香烟氣，人們吐出來的炭酸氣，夾雜着隱約可聞的女人的香粉氣。</p>
<p>這便是一個縮小的世界，農工商學兵應有盡有，大家用着探子的眼光相視，從對方的衣飾舉止方面猜度他的一切。三百六十行，每行有它自已的調兒。</p>
<p>中國人的［和平］美德有時候是靠不住的，爲了針尖大的事便鬥嘴以至動武，這是在短短的航行中時常見到的。被人誤踏了一脚，坐位不公平，或是坐在隔壁的把烟灰彈了過來，於是本來斯文的也不斯文了，互相咒駡，握着拳。船開出了蘇州城，人們暫時安静，行旅中的時間是廉價的，人們特别自在，看報的，三三兩兩低聲説話兒的，對着窗外雲天山水呆看的</p>
<h3>黑女求神記（七）</h3>
<p>— 蕭伯訥作　宣閑譯</p>
<p>我逃避着什麽啦？］她停住了脚，對自已説。［我對於那個可愛的嘈雜的老頭子，是並不害怕的。］</p>
<p>［你的恐懼和希望只是幻想，］從一個戴眼鏡的很近視的年長的人發出來的聲音逼近着她説，那人正坐在一根多疙瘩的木頭上。［你在逃跑的時候有着相輔的反應作用。這是十分簡單的。一向住在獅子們中間的你是從你的幼稚時代，就將吼呌的聲響和死的危險聯想在一起的。當那迷信的老呆驢對你嘶呌的時候，你那慌忙的奔逃就爲此。這個大發見費了我二十五年的研究工夫，在這期間，我解剖了無數的　狗的腦子，在牠們的臉頰上鑽了洞眼，使牠們不從舌頭邊，却從那些洞眼裏流出口涎來，用這樣的法子來觀察牠們的口涎。全世界的科學家佩服着這偉大的成績，感激着這在關於人類行爲的各種大問題上所貢獻的見識，都拜倒在我的跟前了。］</p>
<p>［你爲什麽不問我呢？］黑女孩子説。［我能够在二十五分鐘之内説的你明白，用不着傷害那些可憐的狗。］</p>
<p>［你的無知和妄斷是要不得的，］那近視眼説。［這事實當然是個個小孩子都知道的；然而在實騐室裏這却一向没有經過實騐的證明；所以就科學上説起來，這還没有完全明白。在我着手的時候，這是不熟練的推測；我將這作爲科學傳下去了。請問，你曾經做過實騐工作麽？］</p>
<p>［做過好幾次了，［黑女孩子説。［現在我要來做］回了。你可知道，你可知道，你坐在付麽東西上？］［］我坐在一根年久變了灰色，包着不平順的破敗的樹皮的木頭上，那近視眼説。［你弄錯了，］黑</p>
<p>女孩子説。［你坐</p>
<p>在一條睡着的　魚上面啦。］</p>
<p>發出了彌迦也許會妒忌的一聲大喊</p>
<p>，那近視眼站起身來，狂奔到鄰近的</p>
<p>一株樹邊，便貓也似的攀緣到那株樹</p>
<p>上，那時的敏捷，在這麽年長的紳士</p>
<p>，是十分超人模樣的。</p>
<p>偶然有人談着個使大家感着趣味的題目，便各自停下來，添兩句凑興兒，談高興了時就因此成了莫逆，眞是［志同道合，頭咱們是一夥兒。］</p>
<p>吹牛的，訴苦的，讚揚别人的，叙述自已的，特别是叙述自已的長處的，説得眞有勁。人，總是喜歡的得到羣衆的恭維的。</p>
<p>蛋炒飯，茶葉蛋，豆腐乾，隨你揀：不買的看着，把涎水往肚子裏嚥，佯作無事地往外瞧，數着那從船身滾跑子的波紋····</p>
<p>船一停，大家便密蜂般往外湧。讓婦孺老弱先行有美風，那只在歐美的國家才可以見到。</p>
<h3>德國婦女運動的現在與將來</h3>
<p>— 曙明</p>
<p>德國婦女不知道經過多少奮鬥並且因爲她們在歐戰期間對於國家社會有着特别的勞績，才於一九一八年由德國議會通過給她們以參政權，至於選舉女子做議員則是一九一九年，即德國共和政體成立那一年的事情。當時的國會，雖不過單是制定新憲法的議會，但社會黨共産黨以至最右傾的天主敎黨　陸續選出了女議員的候補者。當選的人都是婦女參政權運動團體裏面的人或是婦女聯盟會裏面的人，不過另有幾個女子却是僅僅對於政治感有興味而並没有參加任何黨派或團體的，這次選舉結果，國會中的女議員計有十四名，而在各州議會中更有許多婦女當選。德國目前除國家社會黨外，可以説任何黨派都是贊成婦女參政的。</p>
<p>德國婦女參政權協會自從獲得了參政權後，對於與婦女有關的政治敎育等事非常出力。她們對於各種部題，如立法案，建議　都十分留心，尤其是對於失業問題及經濟恐慌問題，更常常作精密的討論，謀與男子協力設法救濟並澈底解决。</p>
<p>現在德國婦女在社會上實在具有狠大的勢力，不僅是幾個婦妇在議會裏出出風頭而已，無論是司法部，敎育部，勞工部外交部都有婦女佔着狠高的位置，甚至有的當社會運動局局長，有的握青年局的樞紐。她們辦起事來都非常認眞，這實在使人歎服。原來德國女子參政的目的，並不僅僅在攫得議會中的幾把交椅和在各界佔着幾個位置，她們的目的乃是想爲後輩的婦女開拓一條新途徑，並實實在在替國家幹些事情。自從婦女參政實施以來，至今已有十四年，在這期間，一般婦女曾表現許多令人驚歎的成績，德國本身確實得了狠大的收穫。她們的努力現在已爲一般人所公認。不過現在德國婦女參政運動遇着了一個極大危機，這就是希特勒主義的勃興。</p>
<p>希特勒雖然標榜國家社會主義，但是他和他的一般信徒都不贊成婦女參政，他們對待婦女正如對待猶太人一樣，現在該黨得勢，德國婦女恐怕只有完全雌伏於家庭之一途。許多人常常説：希特勒主義的澎漲，就是德國婦女參政權的消滅。這實在是狠可憂慮的事。</p>

<h3>風氣與民氣</h3>
<p>— 賡</p>
<p>慨自九一八事變爆發以來，精誠團結，打破國難之呼聲，未嘗不如商店削本拍賣之吹打，高出雲表，但是國難打了一年半，究竟打破重圍而殺出一條血路没有？試用顯微鏡一照，則見整個國體的細胞，幾乎每個間都浸入了亡國菌種：再用望遠鏡一窺，則未來之重重國難，亦大有歷一程猶有一程以相待之趨勢。國家糜爛至此，殆有史以來所僅覯。分析原因，雖頗複雜但［居恒則如一潭死水，臨變亦不過如被投石，略起微波而已］之民氣，實爲一切肇禍階厲之主要根由！</p>
<p>暴日未六小時全佔瀋陽，未一禮拜而奄有遼吉，竟至於席捲東北，國人固可嚴責於東北長官，何以要留平聽［後庭花］之歌唱而未及防範，但榆關天險失守之時，又何嘗不在新年歡樂，通宵達旦之鑼鼓爆竹聲中奉送掉？此外沉面於影院舞塲之狂歡酣舞者流，更不知凡幾？此種［不知亡國恨］之民氣，猶多在大都市中見之，非［商女化］百何？他如豐歳唯知［鼓腹而歌，帝力於我何有］，歉歲或兵燹亦唯知［馨香禱祝眞命天子出世］的一般内地鄉村老百姓，也是占所謂［國人］大多數的此輩道地十足的同胞，倘課以應付嚴重國難之民氣，那眞一部二十四史不知究從何處開卷？死水般的民氣談起來令人不開心如此，就談民風，又何嘗能給人以好的現象，袁處大處，姑置不論，就拿前兩天報載廣州著名交際花陳瑞華女士募捐援助東北義勇軍的新聞，所引起一部份讀者的反映來做例子吧，報上分明載着：［陳女士以一弱女，不克効命疆場，特以美姿容貢獻國家，··近來時有鉅欵匯與東北義勇軍］。此種彰明較著之愛國［心］［行］，其能利用個别的優越特點。由迂道以收救國實效的正當行爲，雖稱其可與前次九三叟馬相伯先生售字募捐。中委何香凝女士畫展募捐之價值等量齊觀，殆非過譽，詎料此類可欽可佩之愛國舉動，竟有人帶着十八世紀的大框眼鏡，對陳女士加以非議，亦可概見民風腐壞之一班！</p>
<p>雖然，曾國藩曾説過，［風俗之厚薄。自乎一二人之心之嚮往而已］。我們如果承認此言有理的話，則此後將如何以扶掖民氣培養民風之大責任，似乎又不便專一責成萬事有份的國人了。</p>

<h3>大學突舍的一餐飯</h3>
<p>— 愼之</p>
<p>丨現在大學生生活之一！</p>
<p>還是前個月，學校剛要放寒假的前幾天，在太陽西斜的時候，我從公司裏出去，到某大學宿舍找一位好久未見的朋友。承朋友的歡迎，留我吃夜飯，談空天，他們確是快活的了不得。他們同宿舍，共有四位，也是一同吃飯的。他們的書桌上，没有見過一本書：説錯了，那裏會没有書，多得很的畫片，更有不少的畫報，還有電影明星的照片，呵，豐富得很！</p>
<p>在要吃飯前的半小時光景，他們之中一位西装少年向我的朋友説：［老李，你這樣請客吃飯，不呌幾個人陪陪嗎？］［就請你們幾位陪不好嗎？］我的朋友老李這樣回答。西装少年忙着説：［這有什麽意義？應該去請你的那幾位女朋友來陪吃飯，才會有人生的意義。如果一個堂堂的大學生請朋友吃飯，連一位密司做陪客都没有，那是我們的霉也被你倒了丨老：快去！］</p>
<p>原來所來謂老李者，這半年來，也有好些海上的摩登氣了他同學中有許多摩登密司和他要好，以前他還是瞞着我的。這大，他被那西装少年逼着，迫着，也只好公開了。於是他們兩位便向門外出去。不一會兒，門外就來了那高底皮鞋的［托托聲，和着歡笑的細語聲。老李先推進了門，站在旁邊很恭敬地説：［密司，請進！］一時和我談着話的幾位，一齊地向那進來的三位密司説：［眞正光榮呀！許多密司駕臨敝舍。］他們大家手忙脚亂，拿椅子的拿椅子，倒開水的倒開水，掛大衣的掛大衣。老李也忘記了爲我介紹，我祇好一聲不響的看。幸而，其中一位密司，却直接來問我；［這位先生貴姓？］我尚未回答，老李便忙替我説：［這位就是最早提倡女子解放的新思想家Ｔ先生，現在銀行裏辦事，收入甚豐。］這一個介紹，特别奇怪的是［收入甚豐］，當時我實有些不解。三位密司便同向我點頭微笑，並説：［原來就是密司特李常説的密司特Ｔ，我們正要請敎了！］</p>
<p>呵，我實在不敢當她們的請敎，我所主張的女子解放，决不是現在摩登女子所要求的解放。老李再向我介紹説：［這三位密司都是我的同學，這一位是同班的密司Ｃ，這位是三年級的密司Ｗ，那位是西装少年的情人密司Ｌ。她們的歌舞都很好。］這樣一介紹，那密司Ｌ却臉了現了一點桃紅，西装少年倒感到很得意的樣子，並向老李説：［老李，現在我們好擺桌吃飯了，這樣才像一個大學生請朋友吃飯的樣子。］他一面説，一面向他的情人微笑。</p>
<p>我們吃飯了，但一面便開始笑談。密司們都頗健談，Ｃ坐在我的右邊，對我特别表示殷誠，好像是很熟識的，這樣，那樣的問，問我有幾個愛人？問我以爲那種女子最可愛？我的答案是：［我祗有一個愛人，她不是摩登，她是我的苦難之交，她是眞正解放了的女子，她是能吃得起所有的困苦。一這時老李便把眼睛向我作姿勢，把脚來碰我的脚，好像告訴我；［對女子不要這樣認眞的説，現在的摩拿女子，都是給我們男子玩玩的東西：她旣然這樣問你，便是要你説，［我没有别的愛人，我最愛像你這樣的女子。］這是她心裏很快活的。］呵，這也是老李的經騐，但我的良心，却不願我接受他這個經騐。西装少年與Ｌ是同坐在一邊，祗是兩人互相談笑談，飯是等於没有吃。Ｗ比較静默些，但她也廍了不少：［某與某現在很好，某人現在很消極，某人現已成有名的交際花，一個外洋新回來的博士，也親來校裏找她，請她到國泰去看電影，一品香吃大菜，還到先施公司買了不少名貴的東西，坐了汽車送她回來，據説這一天化了三百多塊錢呢，她眞幸福！］一餐飯吃完，又是談變愛，説明星</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>。到了七點多鐘，西装少年又大請我們吃點心。原來他所以一定要老請女同學來陪吃飯，是［醉翁之意不在酒］！我點心吃過，便告辭回來，但她們還留在宿舍裏，並説也還要去看電影，已打電話去呌汽車了。</p>
<h3>出路</h3>
<p>— 爾礎</p>
<p>雖然他是個不滿二十歲的少年，却自以爲是健全的成人，中華民國的一員好漢。</p>
<p>民族的危機，國家的恥辱，使他憂杞而憤怒。他知道祖國需要他，他並不像一般所謂站在時代線上的青年的樣的麻木。無論何時，他都喜和人談及救國的方針，國際間的一切會議····態度是那樣的悲壯，言語是那樣的沉前，然而結果是遭到了一個［瘋狂］，［時代落伍［的惡名。</p>
<p>他的父親，總是勸他念外國書，不要儘是這樣瘋癲癲。但是這根本就不合他的脾胃，他愛閲報，尤其是一些關於時事的義軍的消息。</p>
<p>父親的固執，友朋的奚落，以及窮的相逼，他却不以爲然：孤單的生活，他已過慣了。</p>
<p>榆關的失守，熱邊的告急，使他再也忍不住了，堅持要去加入義勇軍。但他的父親，那裏肯放他跑。他於是感到莫大的苦痛，一方面又悲哀中國人心之已死。實在中國目下所處的地位，是無法援救的了。智識階級的青年，堂堂的大學生，依舊還在桃色的夢中憧憬着，希冀着。</p>
<p>他想到加入義軍的旣不可能，就實行宣傳了：惟宣傳的力量最大，宣傳的効力最大，於是他便荷着長凳，選擇人羣擁擠的地位宣傳。</p>
<p>他走上大街看見有一處在修築馬路，旁置一牌，上書：此路不通］，他就在這裏放下長凳，開如講演了：］·····我們都知道：中華是我們的中華。在中華民國的土地上，是决不能容納那些猛獸久留的···親愛的同胞！我們是中華民國的國民，中華民國富强，我們國民當然也富强，然而中華民國懦弱，我們也跟着懦弱，中華民國淪亡了，我們也甘心强着做亡國奴嗎？哼！不！這是大錯了。中華民國懦弱，我們應當努力振起精神，力圖恢復，使中華民國成一個世界上强有力的國家。現在我們的中華，是怎樣的一個中華？當然，我們大家都知道，是處於極度危險的狀態之下了。看吧！我們的主權被人剥削殆盡！我們的土地，天天在被人宰割！我們的同胞，永遠被人蹂躪！實在，我們的中華民國，竟宛如這條街道；你們看這四字丨此路不通，丨這路不通的原因：是爲了街道的損壞。那末，我們的國家，也和這街道一樣，這街道是永遠不通行了嗎？我們的國家也永遠懦弱被欺嗎？我想：諸位總知道，祇要這般工人修理完竣，這街道不就是通了嗎？不就是多了一條出路了嗎？我們的國家旣有這許的人，不也可以像工人般的振起了精神，努力的奮鬥，來改革我們的國家，不是也有出路了麽？他聲嘶力竭的喊着，講着，幾乎成了唖子。然而憑他怎樣的喊着，聽者總是寥寥，他於是嘆了一口氣，懊喪的回去。</p>
<h3>黄包車夫與少爺教育</h3>
<p>— 約翰</p>
<p>丨丨答［毓］先生］一個黄包車夫的兒子］丨丨</p>
<p>記得在個把星期以前，有一位［毓一］先生在本刋上提出一個問題來討論，我讀了他的大文以後，很想説兩句話。先，我要對於［毓］先生的所述，孢着很大的懷疑：就是説，生在今日的社會裏，特别是在上海·樣樣顯現着畸形，處處揭示着矛盾的社會裏，以一個營養尚且不足、睡眠從没充分，而兩條腿整日要運動着不停，拼着性命在生活的鞭子底好挣扎的［黄包車夫］，能不能給他的兒子進學校讀到初中畢業？事實允不允他的兒子有踏入高貴門檻而享受少爺，紳士之敎育的幸福？退一百步説，［毓］先生筆下的［黄包車夫］是例外中的例外又例外，他的兒子簡直是［黄包車］夫］中的天之驕［子］，但，拿汗，血，氣喘，和肉脚，以及［先生加一個銅板］］挣來的錢，錢裏就滲透了汗，血，氣和肉，這，在一個［黄包車夫］的眼裏，那怕他例外到怎樣程度，我想，至少我一個人如此想，誰也是絕對不會讓他的兒子進學校而完成中等敎育！何况事實又不准許着呢？</p>
<p>次，姑把［毓］先生的所述，當眞是回現有的事實，那末，我們對於這位［黄包車夫］自然表示着無限的敬佩和同情。對於他的那位不爭氣的［初中畢業］［装了一點洋氣］，而最後［反偷了家裏］的洋錢衣服，一走了之］的少爺，一方面我們固然會學那班慣於責備别人的面孔，責駡他是［不能吃苦，不懂服務的］青年：没事做，没飯吃，是活該！］然而，另一方面，我們正應當對於這個不幸的青年致萬分的憤慨與婉惜！我們憤慨他的父親千不該萬不該給一個生來有爲的青年，送入少爺制造所去進速成班；我們更婉惜着他，設若他從生之開始就能繼承他的父業，或者能夠闖入另一世界去做創造者，至少至少，他絕對不會染着洋氣而没有工做没有飯吃，以至於偷了家中的東西出去做街頭的流浪兒，這是何等的不幸啊！這給予他一生的損失和痛苦是如何的重大啊！</p>
<p>雖説這是一個極其嚴重的社會問題：但，擺在眼面前的所謂敎育，實實在在是造成這一問題的主因！所以它本身亦老早就成了一個絕大的問題！</p>
<p>不過，［黄包車夫］拿自已的親生的兒子，有爲的青年，活生生的送去處凌刑，無論怎樣説，這是太不上算與值得我們表示萬分憤慨和婉惜！！！如果［毓］先生所述是眞的話。</p>

<p>人生不過一個戲子，宇宙是一大舞台，文的，武的，總是這麽一回事。　　（二）過去，現在，將來，都是同樣的生活在灰色的宇宙裏。地球要無數萬年才有一變，誰有這樣長的壽命呢？怪不得聰明人，專是尋樂。我們眞太愚笨了呀！</p>

<h3>像丢了魂魄似的苦悶</h3>
<p>— 王保生</p>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>鄙人是在某公司裏當職員的，每月的薪俸，很夠我的用度：所以對於物質方面，我總算已經得相當安慰。可是我有一件事，使我萬分痛苦。我平時最要好的女朋友，也就是我的愛人，她與我同年，今年十九歲。在二年前，我已認識了她：當時她的確是一個天眞活潑的好女子。可惜近一年來，她因爲交了幾個不良的良友，時常出去看電影，賭銅鈿，有時甚而至於到什麽著名俱樂部或公司裏去賭。賭得夜深了，就同幾個女朋友，開了房間，住在外面，她家中祇有一個每母親，一個哥哥，那裏會知道她這種舉動，還相信她住在朋友家裏呢。在最近的幾星期裏，我又探聽得她有了别的情人了！而且她這個情人，是我最要好的朋友呢！我早已對於她的舉動，不能滿意；現在更爲了我的朋友起見，在上星期冩了封信給她，與她决裂。這樣似乎可以告一段落了；那知我的心裏，終覺得苦悶萬分，好像丢了魂魄似的，做起事來，不免大打折扣，因此在公司裏常吃［排頭］。編者先生，你是一個有智有才的人物，請你回答我，什樣才能解脱這個苦悶。專肅謹請撰安王保生上</p>
<p>編者按：［英雄］與［美人］，在中國人腦筋裏，似乎以爲他們絕對不許發生關係。但是我們不但在歷史裏，可以找到像［傾國又傾城，反使周郎受重名］等一類的例子；而且還常常可看到像王君般因［失戀］而失却做事勇氣的事實。我們鼓勵一般已經得到［如花美眷］的人們，加倍地努力，去發展他們的事業：我們却不能容許［失戀］者的頽唐。我們的生命綫是［事業］，無論如何，必須向着這光明大道，厲步前進；至於美人，不過有時可以作爲一種鞭策，使得我們格外進行得快些罷了。失了這種鞭策，還是要走的呀！</p>
<p>王君的愛慕其女友，原本因爲她［天眞活潑］的緣故，現在她旣已失却了這種可愛的美德，反沾染了許多可鄙的惡習；那末根本就没有被愛的資格了。所以王君毅然的與她决裂，是再好也没有了。至於目下的苦悶，我們却替你想到一個辦法，包管可以把他驅逐出境。你旣經是一個物質方面得到解决的人，同時世界上也不少好女子；你無妨從今日起，就留心物色一個比你現在的女朋友更好的人呢。不過我們還勸王君找到了愛人之後，趕快結婚；因爲這可以避免對方女子，再像你現在的女友一樣，爲惡社會所同化呀！同時在没有找到愛人以前，就休閒時間，去從事有益的消遣，如運動，音樂，藝術等等。這樣旣可移轉你的精神，不致過分［丢不開來］：同時從這種高尚的消遣裏，也可得到相當的益處。</p>
<p>我們以爲王君還可將她近來不好的舉動，除了你們倆的一段戀愛史外，告訴你的男性朋友，囑他勸勸這個已墮落的少女；或者因爲他倆正在火一般的熱戀時期，倒會收到良好効果。這樣你非但可以對得起你的老友，也不枉與她相好一塲了。</p>

<h3>詩禮人家（二六續）</h3>
<p>— 汪仲賢</p>
<p>十三　詩禮人家淪爲市儈商塲</p>
<p>若華氣得幾乎暈了過去，幼中怕她張揚起來不當穩便，連連向她求恕，並陳述懺悔之意，她含着一泡眼涙説：</p>
<p>［我爲你冒了許多危險，爲你也曾做過不顧性命的事，我恨不得挖出心肝］</p>
<p>來待你，結果還是換不到你的心！黛秋身上，我勸你死了心吧，她把你恨如切骨，她要咬你的肉，她咒你早死，這都她親口告訴我的話，她若不是爲了你是我的愛人，她早就不認你是叔叔了，我勸你醒醒吧！］</p>
<p>［我現在都明白了，不過黛秋天天同我見面，我的心總要不由自主的惦記着她。我今生永不願再見她的面，不是她讓我，就是我讓她。］</p>
<p>［這很容易的事，你説：我同你做夫妻，怕敗壞你家的門風，那末同你換］</p>
<p>一個地方去住着，人家只知道我們是夫妻，還有誰來追根問底呢？况且你做了犯法的事，我也不放心你住在本地，反正我是死都要和你死在一塊的。］　　［我們走了，黛秋呢？］</p>
<p>［你還惦記着她嗎？留她看家就是了，由她自已去挑選，我是］不問她的事了，這地方我越想越危險，风們今天晚上就動身吧！越遠越好。］　　幼中沉思了一回，忽又哀求道：［我們去後，就怕没有日子回來了，我想］</p>
<p>要求你准許我同黛秋談半點鐘話，待我留幾個錢給她，也好讓她生活。］　　若華説：［她没有好臉給你看的，你淡怕挨駡，就去見她吧，不過不許你］多躭擱時候！</p>
<p>［你趕緊收拾行李，我去二十分鐘就來。］</p>
<p>幼中去了，若華忙呌丫頭進來收拾行李：她装了十幾隻大皮箱，一看鐘點，已過了半點鐘，她正欲去催幼中，突見老胡滿頭大汗的奔進來報道：　　［阿海被警察捉去了，不知犯了什麽大案件，聽説還牽涉到五少爺身上呢］</p>
<p>！］</p>
<p>若華等不得老胡説完，急忙向裏就奔，跑到黛秋房門口，正見着她與幼中挽手出來，她已換了出門的衣服，一手拿着一個小皮箱，一手挾着一件外衣，幼中也提着一隻箱子，若華奔上去拉着幼中道：［阿海已被人捉去了，我們快］</p>
<p>走吧！］</p>
<p>黛秋抱着幼中的膀子，幼中洒脱了若華，衛護着黛秋向外急奔，若華拚命式趕上去，扭住幼中的衣服，急喘着問道：</p>
<p>［你發瘋了嗎？］</p>
<p>幼中一面想洒開她，嘴裏很乾脆的説道：［黛秋已答應嫁給我了！她願意］</p>
<p>跟我遠走高飛，你不要來阻攔我們！］</p>

<h3>珍妮和却爾斯法雷的已往</h3>
<p>— 西容</p>
<p>珍妮已自由····他們能復合嗎？</p>
<p>電景皇后妮蓋諾突然和她的［皇夫］李杜爾璧克離婚了，這事已見昨日本報。此事發生於電影皇帝却爾斯雷脱離福斯公司之後，前後不過一月，當然就有許多人説珍妮蓋諾與李杜爾的［法律離婚］係與她和却爾斯法的［銀幕離婚］是有密切之關係的。我們且將其中蛛絲馬跡，探討一下，而作一想像的結論。</p>
<p>第一點，珍妮與却爾斯的友愛，是確實的，却爾斯自已亦曾説過，他説他與珍妮有手足兄妹之情。第二點，珍妮先認識李杜爾。珍妮與李杜爾初會之時，她與却爾斯已經有很明顯的蘿蕚絲。第三點，珍妮嫁李杜爾，相識的時間極爲短促，且事前並未公佈，卽却爾斯亦爲之驚訝不寗的。第四點，珍妮嫁李杜爾之後，兩人意見卽不融合，但珍妮别有隱衷，不肯告人。第五點，珍妮的離婚，並無［另有其人］夾雜其中。珍妮亦絕無浪漫的事跡，卽李杜爾亦並無不規則之事爲人所指摘。</p>
<p>以上諸點係確確實實大衆所共知的事實，我們可用以爲測騐的根據的。其餘好萊塢傳説，證據並不十分確實的是（一）珍妮之嫁李杜沨是與却爾斯鬥氣，係一種Ｓpite　marriage，係對於却爾斯的一種報復行爲。她與李杜爾並無深切之愛情，所以結婚極爲怱促，結婚後亦無樂趣可言，因爲她的芳心當然係不離却爾斯左右的。（二）珍妮結婚之後，却爾斯立卽乘船泛海離開好萊塢。這係却爾斯心傷之後，暫時遠避之意。（三）珍妮嫁後一年多，却爾斯新亦就怱怱地同一位女戲子Ｖirgingia　Ｖalli在紐約結婚，並且結婚之後，立時乘船赴歐渡蜜月。據説這是因爲却爾斯傷心已極，不可再忍受，於是想出這［你卽這樣，我亦可以這樣［的抝勁。（四）却爾斯的脱離福斯與銀幕，是因六七年來，受合同之束縛，日日與［琵琶抱］的情人，作熱烈之表演。傷心人心創愈深，遂有不得出諸走之一途。（五）珍妮亦明知却爾斯離開銀幕的　衷，但百計思量，無法加以寛慰，如是自已不得不與李杜爾離，以示寸心無牠。</p>
<p>以上證據實的五種事實，和證據並不十分確實的五種議論，放在一起，已覺得針鋒相對，拍之卽合。正似影片的各景得段已全，祇須加以剪接配合，卽可成爲一本很好的影片。所以我們現在祇須再作些剪接的工作了。</p>
<p>却爾斯和珍妮的事，怎樣加以剪接配合呢？原來丨聽説丨他們已經訂過婚約。不過却爾斯早先有一位女朋友丨是一位女戲子丨他們來往甚密，與珍妮定情之後，一時亦未能加以斷絕，有一次爾斯約了珍妮和兩位男朋友去遊船。將要啟程之前，那位女朋友忽然打電話給却爾斯，要和他商量一件事。却爾斯没有法子，就呌她在碼頭等他，不料却爾斯兩位朋友之中，有一個是漢奸，亿偷偷兒他打了一個電話給妮，説却爾斯有意要帶那戲子一同去遊船。珍妮聽了大爲生氣，因爲她屢次警戒爾斯，不許和那女戲子來往，却爾斯亦答應過不和她再來往，今舊情未斷，顯見愛情不專。所以珍妮亦未上船，這時認識李杜爾不久，因爲李杜爾很有意於她，所以一怒之餘，就允許嫁給李杜爾了，於是大錯鎛成，貽恨終身。　　現在珍妮雖與好杜爾離婚，但是却爾斯已娶了那女戲子。能否他們亦離婚，使却爾斯得與珍妮復合，還是一個大疑問。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評失戀</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>很明顯的，中國的電影在最近的一二年中，確是很快的進步着，假如以中國簡短的電影歷史爲比例，那末我們不能不承認這進步的速度確是驚人。不過，究竟因爲歷史的短促，以致許多電影從業員還不能夠由於充分的經騐而得到技術上美滿的成績。丨在看完了明星公司的失戀之後，我有了如上的感覺。　　失戀的故于，是針對着現代某種［上等華人］而加以痛駡。牠並且説明了他們的前途没有出路，這一點很能得着觀衆的同情。但是觀衆們在感覺痛快之餘，他們將怎樣的來消滅這中國的敗類？怎樣來爲自身謀解放呢？這是失戀中所忽視而没有明白的指出。這不能不是本片的缺點吧？</p>
<p>本來，像這樣的題材，我們很可以找着許多眞實的例證。雖然不以有不穿挿一點戀愛的花樣，但也不必以纞愛爲主幹，諸如水災，反帝，反貪官污吏各點上。都可成爲中心。</p>
<p>那末，本片的結構旣是如此，當然導演只好在纞愛的一點上努力，使人們在劇情上看過去一目了然。在好些塲面中，我們可看出導演之技巧的純熟。不過壞的塲面也不是没有，如火車中各軍官之談論美琳，如文安之被旅長毆打，不免誇張，以及其他還有許多。特别是旅長指揮軍隊前進的一塲，眞是過於幼稚，然而本劇的結局却是别開生面而不落俗套，這當然是導演最大的成功。</p>
<p>至於張織雲的表演，可以説是本片中最成功的一個。她的動作和表情，都可以看出她之富有經騐。可是他在全劇中没有明顯的變換，尤其是當最後覺悟了自已的出路的時候，仍是那樣悲哀而不能積極起來，可以説是她的缺點。［槐秋在本片中充分的告訴我們由舞台到銀幕確不容易。嚴月嫺在中間的幾個塲面顯得純熟。還有王微信太不能適合劇中人周國材。還有另外幾位軍官，亦不敢稱譽。</p>
<p>至於佈景，前部富鼈堂皇，後部流露出做假的痕跡。燈光可取。收音很好，尤其是那鐘聲，可是火車的聲音不像。全部説來，前段比後段好。在這一片中可以找着明星公司進步的痕跡。</p>

<p>凱綸瑪蘭ＫarenＭorley活像葛雷泰嘉寳，雖是不完全拒絕新聞記者們的訪問，可是她對於自已的事比任何明星不肯輕易多談。便是她最近二個月前的［于歸之喜］亦秘而不宣。在去年秋天，凱倫祇是淡漠然宣告她已和青年的外籍導演却爾士維多（與金維多並無關係的）訂婚了。她不戴一隻訂婚指鐶。她也不確定一個結婚的時期。據説她曾對攝影塲中人表示，等她决定日期，自會告訴人家的。後來，記者們和無線電台的報告員堅稱她已結過婚，她也不承認或否認。直至攝影塲中人請她宣示眞相，她説：［我並未結婚。我何必私下去幹。有了日子自會告訴你們的。也許她已告訴了攝影場方面，而攝影塲中人在新片［肉體］可Ｆlesb攝完前代她嚴守秘密，以免新聞記者的擾攘，［肉體］完成之後，她才宣佈她已在十一月五日在加利佛尼省之聖旦安那地方嫁了却爾士。在她公佈之時，她便自由地啓程作長期的蜜月旅行了。這消息之</p>
<p>在她公佈前，她絕對不同她</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Launch Large-Scale Invasion of Rehe, League of Nations General Assembly Opens Yesterday</h3>
<p>Chairman Hymans Officially Announces Failure of Mediation Efforts</p>
<p>Adjournment Until Friday to Discuss Report</p>
<p>Allowing Sufficient Study by Various Governments</p>
<p>Nineteen-Member Committee Convenes After General Assembly</p>
<p>Begins Organizing Ten-Nation Negotiation Committee</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations General Assembly convened at 3:45 PM today. Chairman Hymans reported on the development of the Sino-Japanese dispute and the failure of the Nineteen-Nation Committee's mediation. The General Assembly then adjourned until Friday (the 24th) to discuss the draft report, allowing various governments sufficient time to study the report and instruct their representatives in Geneva on the attitude they should take. (Central News Agency dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>(Geneva) At today's League of Nations General Assembly, Chairman Hymans stated in his address that the failure of mediation was due to Japan's lack of concession. After Hymans concluded his address, the meeting adjourned, and neither the Chinese nor Japanese representatives had the opportunity to speak. Japan has repeatedly threatened to withdraw from the League. According to observations here, Japan is currently still hesitating and looking back, and will not immediately announce its withdrawal. (Central News Agency dispatch, 21st) (Geneva) Recently, whenever the League of Nations convened to discuss the Sino-Japanese conflict, the spectator seats were always full. This afternoon was no different. Before the League of Nations General Assembly convened, journalists and those generally interested in the Far Eastern situation had already entered the venue to find seats. When Chairman Hymans announced the opening of the meeting, the entire venue was silent. People in the meeting, besides feeling that they were witnessing and creating history, also had considerable worries. Secondly, many felt that the report of the Nineteen-Member Committee did not address all possible contingencies. Therefore, they hoped to obtain from the meeting a method to remedy this deficiency. Secondly, many felt that there was still the possibility of large-scale warfare. This morning, a Japanese document warned that a major war in Rehe and elsewhere might break out. This was especially unforgettable for everyone. Before the meeting, the capital was very much like a film set, with cameras, including those of Gaumont and Pathé, placed in the four corners to capture photographs of the people entering the scene. The General Assembly opened at 3:45 PM, and after the photography was completed, the bell rang and the meeting began. The first item on the agenda was the issue of electing a director of the Nansen International Refugee Relief Organization. This was followed by a discussion of the Sino-Japanese issue. Hymans recounted the instructions given by the League of Nations General Assembly on December 9, as well as the draft resolution and explanatory memorandum prepared by the Nineteen-Member Committee. He believed that since the League of Nations General Assembly required a unanimous vote, including both parties involved, it would be fruitless to submit the draft to the General Assembly without first obtaining the consent of the Chinese and Japanese governments. Hymans continued, stating that both countries' representatives had proposed amendments to this draft resolution, and Japan even suggested fundamental changes. Therefore, the Nineteen-Member Committee felt it would be difficult to propose a draft resolution that could obtain unanimous consent. However, the Committee wanted to give both parties, especially Japan, the necessary time to study this issue and submit new proposals. Therefore, it decided to adjourn until January 16 to continue discussions. Although Japan occupied Shanhaiguan in early January, and there were rumors of an advance into Rehe, the situation became increasingly serious. However, the Executive Committee still decided to wait and did not want to hastily conclude that last month's efforts had failed. On January 18, Japan's proposal was not only unacceptable to China but also unacceptable to the Committee. However, the Committee still began new talks with Japan, based on Japan's new proposal, hoping that what Japan opposed was only the inclusion of non-League members in the mediation committee. The Committee would then consult with both parties and seek a solution. Hymans then recounted the subsequent negotiations with Japan and the study of the amendments proposed by China, stating that after these negotiations and studies, the Committee determined that China and the Committee valued the invitation of the United States and Russia and would not allow the Committee to delete the clause inviting the United States and Russia after amending other clauses of the draft resolution in accordance with Japan's proposal. The Committee then drafted this report, believing that only the League of Nations General Assembly had the right to invoke Article 15, Paragraph 4 of the Covenant. In view of the fact that Japan's response to the Committee's inquiry regarding the status quo of [Manchukuo] was not a solution, the Committee had no choice but to recognize that the Committee had exhausted its possible mediation efforts. This is the situation that the League of Nations faces today. Mediation efforts have been underway for seventeen months. At the beginning of the incident, Japan had assured the Executive Yuan that Japanese troops had begun to withdraw to the railway area and would withdraw completely as soon as the safety of Japanese lives and property was guaranteed. Today, the three northeastern provinces have been occupied, and Japanese troops have crossed the Great Wall to attack Yuguan. Military preparations for the invasion of Rehe are also underway. According to Article 15, Paragraph 4 of the Covenant, the mediation procedure cannot be concluded until the League of Nations has reported. However, I am unwilling to hastily make a request aimed at mediation, because such a request requires not only a new proposal acceptable to the League of Nations but also a guarantee that the situation will not worsen and that new military actions cannot be taken. I do not want to propose that we study this report today, because at this important juncture, we must not act hastily. Because the various governments must have sufficient time to send their instructions to Geneva, I propose that the discussion of this report be postponed until February 24. The Chairman's proposal was accepted by all, and the League of Nations General Assembly adjourned until Friday. After the General Assembly adjourned, the Nineteen-Member Committee immediately convened to solicit the agreement of those willing to participate in the negotiation committee, so that their countries' names could be included in the report. It was then decided that this committee would be composed of ten member states, namely Germany, Italy, France, England, Spain, Ireland, Czechoslovakia, Canada, Portugal, and the Netherlands. The Committee decided to meet again on Thursday to discuss procedural issues and decided that no discussion should be held on the passage of the report, hoping that this would complete the League of Nations General Assembly proceedings by Friday evening. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Judging from various signs, the next meeting of the League of Nations General Assembly will have a revolutionary move in terms of procedure and results. Therefore, this time there will only be actions and no speeches, which is very different from previous League of Nations meetings. Tomorrow's meeting will only listen to the report of the Nineteen-Member Committee's Chairman Hymans on the Committee's work. In addition, it is unlikely that anyone will speak. Once the Assembly has elected a Director of the Nansen International Refugee Relief Bureau to succeed Hu Bai, the Assembly will adjourn so that the members can study the report in detail. Much of what Hymans has to say is already in the historical chapters of the report. Therefore, Hymans's statement will probably take only twenty or thirty minutes. Hymans is expected to speak about the negotiations and explain how the mediation failed. Although the exact wording is not yet known, it is expected that Hymans will cite more than one reason for the failure of the mediation. The door to mediation is still open, and this door will not close until the General Assembly has effectively passed the report. At Friday's League of Nations General Assembly, Matsuoka and Yan Huiqing will definitely make speeches. Representatives from other countries may also speak at the last moment, but at present, no one has expressed a willingness to speak except for the chief representatives of China and Japan. There is not much progress on the organization of a special committee representing the League of Nations General Assembly to monitor the situation. If one of the two parties does not accept it and the negotiation committee cannot be convened, then this special committee must be formed. If China does not take further steps to request the application of Article 16 of the Covenant, will this report naturally come to an end? Or will the League of Nations General Assembly still naturally be involved in this dispute? This is a matter for jurists to discuss. The mechanism for convening the negotiation committee may be slightly changed in order to allow the negotiation committee to meet and discuss if the negotiations fail to materialize. This is also not impossible. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Today, a movement has begun among the representatives to limit speeches at Tuesday's League of Nations General Assembly in order to make the League of Nations' adoption of the Nineteen-Nation Committee's proposal more effective. Currently, eight member states have agreed to limit their speeches to stating the facts and striving for brevity, believing that if the League of Nations General Assembly can adopt the proposal immediately without comment, it will show that the countries are standing on the same front. Regarding the continuation of the Nineteen-Nation Committee, today the smaller countries refuted the major countries' calls for its dissolution, arguing that since there is no explicit provision in the League of Nations Covenant prohibiting the appointment of a group to observe events in any dispute, the appointment of the Nineteen-Nation Committee is completely legal, and the continued existence of the Nineteen-Nation Committee is also completely legal.</p>
<p>Today it has been agreed that after the Chairman's statement is delivered at the League of Nations General Assembly, the Chinese and Japanese representatives should immediately be given the opportunity to speak. Yesterday, a representative of a small country predicted that Article 16 of the Covenant would be invoked against Japan within six months, but today, after consulting the opinions of various representatives, very few people agreed with this statement. Most representatives are unwilling to guarantee whether Article 16 will be invoked. (National Telegram, 21st)</p>
<h3>Representatives of Eight Small Countries Hold Secret Meeting Until Late at Night</h3>
<p>Advocate for the Continued Existence of the Special Committee</p>
<p>British Representative Seeks Instructions from His Home Government</p>
<p>(Geneva) Representatives of eight small countries, led by Maria of Spain and the leader of Canada, held a secret meeting at the Hotel Bergues last night from 9:30 PM, discussing the Sino-Japanese dispute until after midnight before dispersing. It is said that they unanimously decided that after the League of Nations votes to adopt the Nineteen-Nation Committee's report and recommendations, it must continue to meet and must authorize the Nineteen-Nation Committee to observe future developments, because the progress of the situation in Manchuria, especially in Rehe, necessitates immediate attention. When the meeting of the eight countries' representatives reached 11:00 PM, they invited League of Nations General Assembly Chairman Hymans to attend. It is expected that Mr. Hymans, influenced by the debate among the eight representatives, may include in his Chairman's statement this afternoon a strong suggestion that the General Assembly and the Nineteen-Nation Committee continue to closely observe the Sino-Japanese dispute.

<h3>US Bans Arms Exports</h3>
<p>Actually a Powerful Economic Blockade Against Japan</p>
<p>Hoover Urges Congress to Immediately Authorize Implementation</p>
<p>(Washington) US President Hoover today suddenly sent a message to Congress, requesting an immediate ban on the sale of arms to belligerent countries, stating that he believed this move would be beneficial to the recovery of the domestic economy, as he clearly felt that there was a danger of war breaking out in the Far East, and the ongoing conflicts in South American countries were also greatly hindering economic recovery. Hoover had previously proposed to Congress to authorize the President, after obtaining the cooperation of various countries, to ban the export of arms to belligerent countries, which was passed by both houses. The current proposal for a separate ban shows the seriousness of the situation and has therefore attracted external commentary. (National Telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>New York dispatch: According to sources in Geneva, the League of Nations will seek to have Mr. Roosevelt, after he assumes the presidency, cooperate with the League of Nations under the banner of the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. US cooperation does not seem to be a problem. The State Department has so far taken an evasive attitude, claiming that no country has approached it with the idea of cooperation. As for whether the US will allow cooperation, it will depend on the nature of the proposal. At the same time, Stimson seems to be making every effort to encourage various countries to initiate a ban on the import of arms into Japan in order to promote its policy of non-recognition of [Manchukuo]. The US arms export ban has been passed by both houses. At the time, the House of Representatives' opinions on this bill were divided into pro and con factions. The pro faction held the following five views: (1) This bill is the first practical step to implement the French representative Massigli's proposal in the League of Nations to not cooperate with [Manchukuo]. (2) The implementation of the arms export ban need not give the impression of opposing Japan. (3) The term [arms] can be interpreted as contraband of war. If the powers are willing, cotton and minerals can be included. If so, the arms export ban would be tantamount to a powerful economic blockade against Japan, giving Japan a fatal blow. (4) The powers are hesitant to announce a boycott of Japan, but replacing it with an arms export ban is the simplest and most effective means of achieving peace. (5) Regarding US cooperation in resolving the Far Eastern dispute, the arms export ban is the most reasonable and constructive method. Although the State Department has officially declared that this bill is intended for South America, the Department is indeed preparing to cooperate with the League of Nations in implementing its Far Eastern policy.

<p>Does Not Believe the Japanese Claim of a Lifeline</p>

<p>Stimson Prepares to Travel to Europe in Person</p>
<p>(Washington) At a time when Japan may withdraw from the League of Nations, the US government is debating whether or not to issue a statement on the Manchurian situation. Today, the members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee mostly advocate caution. (Geneva) Regarding the effort of the small countries to ensure that the League of Nations General Assembly adopts the report and recommendations and does not dissolve the Nineteen-Nation Committee for the time being, it is reported that British Under-Secretary Eden will consult with his home government. (National Telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>Today, the Japanese delegation in Geneva sent a document to the League of Nations, accompanied by a map, detailing the concentration points of Chinese troops in Rehe and North China, pointing out that this is a great danger and stating that Japan has an obligation to assist [Manchukuo] in defending against foreign aggression. An investigation revealed that there are 144,000 Chinese troops within Rehe, and another 330,000 troops south of the Great Wall. Once the war starts, Japan does not want to advance south of the Great Wall unless the actions of the Chinese troops force the Japanese army to do so for strategic reasons. (Reuters dispatch, 21st) It is said that most of the committee members believe that since the United States is not a member state, it is not appropriate to express any attitude or take any action at this time. However, if the rights of American nationals in China are impaired, the US government will take action. It is also reported that the State Department has adopted the same attitude regarding whether to issue a statement on the League of Nations situation, believing that it is not appropriate to make any statement at least until the League of Nations General Assembly votes on the report and recommendations. However, even after the League of Nations General Assembly votes, it has not yet been decided whether the US government will make a statement at this time. Important figures here believe that after Japan decides to withdraw from the League of Nations, this world peace organization can be considered to have achieved a moral victory, but in technical terms, it has failed. Although no one wants to deny that the current tense situation may expand to the entire Pacific region, it is also believed that the united world public opinion may be able to avoid spreading the turmoil to somewhere outside of Manchuria. Officials believe that the Japanese-claimed national security line will be limited to a violent attack on Rehe, and that China, due to the united outward efforts of its domestic troops and the moral support of the League of Nations, will do its best to resist. However, it is also believed that with the opposition of the world, it is difficult to believe that Japan's military actions will exceed Rehe. It is hoped that moral isolation will be able to restrain Japan from undertaking more extensive military actions. It is expected that Japan's future financial difficulties will definitely prompt it to change its attitude and accept the efforts of other countries to seek a peaceful solution. (National) Dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington dispatch: US officials are extremely silent on the Sino-Japanese issue. However, it is clear that Mr. Stimson is determined to cooperate as soon as he receives an invitation from the League of Nations General Assembly's committee for negotiating the Sino-Japanese dispute. Mr. Stimson and the incoming Roosevelt administration will maintain and realize a common front on this matter. Mr. Stimson is reserving comment until the League of Nations takes definite action, but officials recognize that Japan may withdraw from the League of Nations, and they are extremely pessimistic about the new crisis that the predicted war in the Far East will affect US-Japan relations. It is also reported that Mr. Stimson will first discuss the matter with incoming President Roosevelt after accepting the League of Nations' invitation. (World Press)</p>
<p>War Debt Issue Promotes</p>
<p>Anglo-American Joint Restraint of Japan</p>
<p>England is Willing to Provide Singapore for US Naval Use</p>
<p>New York dispatch: The New York Sun's London telegram predicts that Sir Ronald Lindsay, the British Ambassador to Washington, who is departing from Southampton for the United States today, will make several far-reaching proposals to the US State Department. Firstly, Britain will offer the naval base at Singapore for the use of the US Navy. On this point, the telegram strongly states that Britain's attitude towards Japan regarding the Manchurian issue has recently undergone a drastic change, as Britain believes that Japan's actions are too excessive and may inevitably lead to a Sino-Japanese war. If so, Britain can no longer stand idly by. According to the Sun's correspondent, Britain is providing the United States, which is eager to maintain its hegemony in the Pacific, with something that can be used to restrain Japan, which will not only secure favorable terms on the war debt issue but also gain a better position at the next World Economic Conference. In addition, Ambassador Lindsay is expected to propose a multilateral air force disarmament treaty, including the US, France, Britain, Germany, Poland, and other countries. As for Britain's attitude towards the tariff issue, the correspondent said that Britain is willing to reduce import duties on US goods entering Britain by £16 million while urging the US to cancel the annual war debt of $170 million.

<h3>Japanese Navy Prepares for Large-Scale Autumn Maneuvers, Viewing the US as a Hypothetical Enemy</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese authorities are preparing to hold naval exercises in the vicinity of the islands under mandate in the Pacific Ocean in August of this year. The scale of the exercises is unusually large, with 200 warships participating and the cost of the exercises set at 6 million yen. The purpose of these large-scale maneuvers is to test the strategic value of the islands under mandate in the Pacific, the combat effectiveness of the new 10,000-ton cruisers, and the effectiveness of the air force and submarines. Preliminary exercises are currently being conducted in Saeki Bay. The navy participating in the exercises will be ready in July, and on August 20, it will simulate enemy naval aircraft attacking Tokyo Bay to assess the value of Tokyo's air defense facilities. A representative of the Naval Ministry recently declared that if the United States wants Japan to abandon the islands under mandate in the Pacific, the Japanese naval authorities must be prepared to respond. Therefore, there is a deep meaning behind the choice of location for the Japanese naval maneuvers, which is in the vicinity of these islands. (Havas dispatch, 21st)</p>
<h3>Soviet Russia Warns Japan</h3>
<p>Refusal to Sign Non-Aggression Pact Reveals Ambition</p>
<p>If You Dare to Invade, We Will Meet You with a Crushing Blow</p>
<p>Molotov's Speech at the Agricultural Congress</p>
<p>(Moscow) On the 18th of this month, the Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union,</p>
<h3>Lytton's Incisive Criticism of Japan</h3>
<p>People's Political Views Do Not Align with Modern Trends</p>
<p>Military Cliques Run Rampant, Threatening the Foundation of the Nation</p>
<p>Military Force Creates a Puppet State, Russia's Counteraction Fuels Red Disaster</p>
<p>(Paris) Lord Lytton gave a startling speech at the Paris Peace Club today, stating that Japan does not seem to have kept pace with the latest developments in Western political thought or political behavior. Although Japan has established a form of civil government, its army and navy are still organized on a feudal basis, and their leaders, though cabinet members, are independent and only responsible to the government. Their efficiency is undoubtedly unquestionable, but the attitude of their general staff is reminiscent of the Prussian general staff from 1870 to 1914. Judging from the actions of the Japanese people in the past eighteen months, their current attitude in Manchuria resembles that of the famous Jameson Raiders in South Africa in 1895. In the last decade, European political thought has undergone a major transformation, almost similar to the changes in Japan from 1860 to 1900. International relations are now governed by the League of Nations Covenant and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. No country can arbitrarily act solely for its own interests. General staffs of various countries today must not only be subject to the control of their own governments but also obey the obligations stipulated in international treaties. It seems that Japan has not fully understood these matters, and this is what has created the current crisis in the Far East, he said. Lytton went on to mention that Molotov's speech at the All-Union Congress of Collective Farm Representatives, which was just published today, stated that the danger of war still exists, but the Soviet Union is well-armed and prepared to resist invaders. We must not and cannot be attacked unaware. According to Molotov's position, which is equivalent to the prime minister of other countries, his speech emphasized the importance of a certain neighbor refusing to sign a non-aggression treaty, which forced the Soviet Union to concentrate its efforts on manufacturing weapons and ammunition recently. Although Molotov did not explicitly name the country, it was clear that he was referring to Japan. His final remarks also declared that if there is a second intervention in the Soviet Union, the outcome for those imperialists will not be as simple as the first time. The first intervention refers to the dispatch of troops to Siberia after World War I. (20th, National News Agency telegram)</p>
<p>Matsuoka Changes His Route to Return Home</p>
<p>Will Strive to Lobby Britain and the United States</p>
<p>Preventing the Convening of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference</p>
<p>(Geneva) It has just been learned that the Tokyo government has approved the Japanese representative, Matsuoka, to return home via the United States. Matsuoka now hopes to take the Olympic liner from Southampton, England, on March 1st to the United States. After a short stay in Washington and New York, he will return to Japan on the Tatsuta Maru on March 22nd or 23rd. If the situation permits, he plans to stay in London for another week, postpone his trip to the United States, and return to Japan on the Asama Maru from San Francisco on April 13th. (21st, National News Agency telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Foreign Ministry held a ministry meeting last night, which resulted in a telegram ordering the Japanese representative, Matsuoka Yosuke, to return home via Britain and the United States and to visit the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty, requesting the governments of various countries to understand Japan's diplomacy of invading China and preventing the convening of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, especially focusing on Britain and the United States. It is said that the cause of Japan's diplomatic failure this time is the rejection of the white race and the intention to monopolize Asia. Therefore, Matsuoka's visit to the governments of the nine countries this time is specifically to explain the so-called Monroe Doctrine of the Far East. (21st, China United News Agency telegram)</p>
<p>Tokyo Japanese newspapers reported that the Japanese government has decided to withdraw from the League of Nations on the one hand and conduct a policy of cooperation separately with Britain, the United States, France, Italy, Germany, Russia, and other countries to replace the abstract international cooperation centered on the League of Nations. The Japanese government formulates its diplomatic policy according to this principle and hopes to establish a Monroe Doctrine in the Far East, with China, Japan, and [Manchuria] concluding a security agreement, which may be called the Locarno Agreement of the Far East. (20th, Reuters telegram)</p>
<p>China. The most crucial issue at present is how to help China, and when China will be able to establish a strong central government. He was deeply touched by the enormous human resources of China. The future of China seems to depend on how, when, and who will give such great human resources the unified power of national consciousness. Is it Geneva or Moscow? Both the East and the West are now under the shadow of this great question. China is currently inclined towards Geneva, but if Japan insists on its current policy and Geneva fails, then China, even if unwilling, will change its inclination. Japan is anxious about the spread of Russian communism to Korea and sees the gradual rise of the communist tide in southern China, which makes it worried. Nanjing could have welcomed Japan's help in resisting the communist tide, but Japan did not provide it and instead chose to use force, wanting to create a buffer state in Manchuria single-handedly. It must be known that this only increases the danger it wants to prevent, he said. Lord Lytton finally stated that when he used the term "Japan," it should not be misunderstood. The Japanese people have always faithfully supported the League of Nations, but the general staff that temporarily manipulates the Japanese government believes that it can resist Moscow and Geneva at the same time, and this road can definitely lead to peace.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<p>The Japanese Army's Attack on Rehe and Our General Mobilization</p>
<p>(1) General Mobilization to Resist Japanese Imperialism: The Japanese imperialists launched a general offensive on Rehe this morning. This is an expansion of the aggressive acts following the September 18th Incident and is the most pressing and serious moment for our nation.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the September 18th Incident, we firmly advocated stopping the aggressive actions of the Japanese imperialists. We must resolutely raise the banner of resisting Japanese imperialism and launch a national revolutionary struggle, responding to the Japanese imperialist aggression with a bloody struggle and defending the freedom and survival of our nation with a bloody struggle.</p>
<p>Currently, due to the report of the League of Nations' Committee of Nineteen, both the Japanese government and the public are clamoring to [withdraw from the League of Nations]. At the same time, they are launching a general offensive on our Rehe. How should we deal with the current serious situation? Of course, the only way is a national general mobilization to launch a national revolutionary war to resist Japanese imperialists. General mobilization. Only a general mobilization of resistance is the way out for our nation. At present, our slogan should be to respond to the general mobilization of aggression with a general mobilization of resistance.</p>
<p>(2) Japan Has Already Been Generally Mobilized</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the September 18th Incident, Japan has actually been in a state of national general mobilization. The most obvious is the accelerated expansion of this year's budget. The purpose of this budget is actually for military equipment. Celluloid factories and fertilizer factories have been converted into gunpowder and explosive factories. Soda factories have been converted into poison gas factories. Clock factories have been converted into artillery shell factories. Rubber overshoe factories have been converted into balloon manufacturing plants. White copper and lead product factories have been converted into small arms factories. Rayon product factories have been converted into leather factories used for aircraft paint. In short, all [peaceful production industries] have been converted into [wartime production industries]. This is the general mobilization of industry. In terms of combat personnel, although it is said that there are currently only over 300,000 active soldiers, the systematic training of other reserve forces, veterans, youth corps, youth training centers, and fire brigades has already begun. This is the general mobilization of combat personnel. In the Pacific islands, Japan is secretly building naval ports. In Toyohara, Sakhalin, and Niigata, large airfields are being planned. The Hiroshima Tadayumi poison gas factory and the Kitakyushu area are implementing air defense facilities. The air defense network of Japan, Korea, and Manchuria has already been deployed. Other facilities, such as the construction and reconstruction of long-distance automobile roads, wireless communication between Taipei and Manila, and the development of shipping routes from Chongjin Port near the Korean border to Tsuruga, all prove that Japan has already implemented a general mobilization for military action. Even with regard to this attack on Rehe, Japan has actually been generally mobilized for a long time. Japan has a total of seventeen army divisions. Recently concentrated on the Rehe border are the Kumamoto 6th Division, the Hirosaki 8th Division, the Utsunomiya 14th Division, the Asahikawa 14th Mixed Brigade, and the Narashino 1st Cavalry Brigade. In addition, there</p>
<p>are the Himeji Upper Division and the Ryuzan 20th Division scattered in various parts of the Northeast. Japan has concentrated such significant military power on the Rehe border, which in fact also clearly proves that its attack on Rehe has already been generally mobilized. For the sake of aggression, the Japanese imperialists have long been generally mobilized. What about us? For the sake of resisting violence and fighting for survival, if we do not generally mobilize now, when will we?</p>
<p>(3) Several Important Issues in General Mobilization</p>
<p>Before the general mobilization, here are a few important issues. First, we recognize that only the unity and concerted action of the entire nation can generate great power. If one part is mobilized and another part waits and watches, or even hinders it, this is the cancellation of power. This is a phenomenon of disorganization. Such a phenomenon should never exist under the current situation. Under the current slogan of general mobilization, we should launch the great power of the entire nation to carry out a consistent and resolute resistance.</p>
<p>Second, we recognize that only under sufficient freedom and opportunities for activity can the people exert their great power. At the same time, only the united uprising of the entire nation can strengthen the strength of the national revolutionary struggle and win the final victory. Under the current situation, the government should absolutely trust the people and be one with them, giving the people sufficient freedom so that everyone has the opportunity to participate in the national revolutionary struggle. Only in this way can the struggle be sustained, and only in this way can the entire nation be truly mobilized.</p>
<p>Third, we recognize that under the slogan of general mobilization, everything, including the economy, industry, transportation, and food, should be subject to overall planning and allocation. In other words, they should all be placed under military management. Especially the industrial sector. At this time, the manufacture of all luxury goods and peaceful production goods should be stopped, and efforts should be devoted to the production of various military supplies. In his report on the achievements of the Five-Year Plan at the Communist Party Congress in January of this year, Stalin said, "Some people have said that if we put aside this industrial policy and use half the investment to produce or import daily necessities such as clothing, shoes, wool, cotton, etc., life will be better. They don't know that if we only have clothing and shoes, we will have no defensive power, and without modern defenses, a country cannot avoid becoming the target of foreign armed aggression, like China today." Stalin's speech is enough for us to think deeply about. This means that under the current extraordinary situation, people should save on clothing and food, reduce their normal lives, and all activities should be aimed at the national struggle. The national revolutionary war should be the central goal of all activities.</p>
<p>(4) Overthrow the Psychology of Cowardly Survival</p>
<p>Perhaps some people will still say, "Let's be patient. There is no certainty of victory in war." Perhaps some people will still say, "Let's be patient. War will make our sacrifices even greater." Perhaps some people will still say, "Let us recuperate and learn a lesson before avenging our shame." All of these are psychologies of cowardly survival, and all of these are proposals that would ruin the country. We firmly oppose such psychologies.</p>
<p>We ask, is patience more certain than war? How many years will we have to wait to recuperate and learn a lesson? Since September 18th, the sacrifices of non-resistance have been greater than resistance. Why do we not resist? Do we still have room to yield? Do we still have time to survive?</p>
<p>Song Ziwen, the acting president of the Executive Yuan, said in a letter to the soldiers at the front lines the other day, "When robbers come to the door, the only way to survive is to defend ourselves with force. We must fight to the death in order to live. Fighting to the death is our only way out." Indeed, at present, fighting to the death is the only way out for our nation.</p>
<p>We firmly oppose the traditional psychology of fear and cowardly survival. We shout out: General mobilization to resist Japanese imperialists!</p>

<p>(Beiping) For the Japanese plan to launch a large-scale attack on Rehe at the end of this month, they have deployed heavy troops of over 20,000 in the Dahushan to Tongliao area, with Kailu as the target, intending to directly attack Chifeng. Around Jinzhou and Chaoyang, they have deployed a force of about 10,000. This route is mostly mountainous and unfavorable for attack, and its purpose is to guard the Jinzhou-Chaoyang Road and prevent our army from launching surprise attacks. A heavy force of over 20,000 is deployed on the Suizhong-Lingyuan Avenue, with the aim of attacking Lingyuan and heading for Pingquan.

<h3>All Countries Should Supply China with Arms for Self-Defense</h3>
<p>Should Not Support Japan and Encourage Aggression</p>
<p>| British Newspaper's Opinion |</p>
<p>(London) The Daily Telegraph stated in today's editorial that Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations will cause the most serious situation that has occurred since the establishment of the League of Nations. Although member states have withdrawn from the League of Nations in the past, it did not shake the position of the League of Nations. Japan is different. Japan is one of the four major architects of the League of Nations, and the hope of success of the Disarmament Conference will also be extinguished. The News Chronicle stated that the General Assembly of the League of Nations is not a committee of a few people, but represents the public opinion of the civilized world. What member states can do at least is to absolutely prohibit the supply of arms to Japan, while it is different for China. If China stores arms purely for self-defense, but if arms are supplied to Japan, it will enable a strong country to carry out a war of aggression that is condemned by world opinion.

<h3>Japanese Opinions Differ on Countermeasures After Withdrawing from the League of Nations</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs held several departmental meetings to discuss countermeasures after withdrawing from the League of Nations. Opinions were divided and no decision was made. Most members believe that there are two extremes of opinion on the League of Nations strategy. The hardliners advocate complete and resolute rejection, ignoring all meetings and institutions initiated by the League of Nations. The peace faction said that at a time of national difficulty, one should not act on emotion. One should still adopt a perfunctory policy in disputes that are not important to Japan to avoid being targeted by everyone. The following attitude should be adopted to deal with the situation: (1) The General Assembly should not be attended, and the Executive Council should not be attended, and the seat should be vacant in the next session. When it is Japan's turn, it should firmly decline to take the chairmanship; (2) The Disarmament Conference should still be participated in to avoid responsibility for failure; (3) The right to rule the South Sea Islands should never be returned, but the governance report should still be submitted to the Secretariat; (4) The cultural undertakings handled by the League of Nations do not need to be rejected in principle, but the Labor Conference and the Economic Conference will not be formally participated in after two years.

<h3>Wang Jingchun Refutes Churchill's Remarks</h3>
<p>British Conservatives Publicly Support Japan</p>
<p>(London) British politician Winston Churchill gave a speech somewhere, saying that the League of Nations should not be misled by rumors and fight with Japan. The League of Nations is actually engaged in a work that is far from its sphere of influence when dealing with the situation in the Far East, etc. Wang Jingchun, director of the Chinese Eastern Railway, sent a letter to the Manchester Guardian to refute it, first asking whether the duties of the League of Nations are limited to Europe or any other part of the world. Can the foundation of the League of Nations not be broken if Churchill despises this kind of development? Secondly, China and many other countries joined the League of Nations because they understood that the League Covenant would be implemented regardless of the distance of the country, race, or location. If the Covenant treats countries differently, then the League of Nations might as well be called the League of European Powers. Again, if the League of Nations sacrifices its responsibilities for the sake of expediency, will the trust of countries in treaties in the future not be destroyed because of this?

There are a total of eight such old ships. When selling them, British merchants agreed that they could only be demolished.

It has been found that these eight ships have recently sailed to Japan. (21st Reuters dispatch)</p>

The newspaper now believes that Japan will use these materials to manufacture bullets or other war materials. It is also not certain whether the British sellers have obtained a guarantee from Japan that they will not be used to transport troops to China, as one of them is 24,000 tons and another is 15,000 tons, which were very effective in transporting troops during the World War. Another ship, the "Colonia," with a displacement of 20,000 tons, had its generator damaged by a person of unknown origin with acid and is currently unable to leave the port.

<p>British and American War Debt Negotiations</p>
<p>Roosevelt and Lindsay Meet for Two Hours</p>
<p>New York, 20th - Today, British Ambassador Lindsay paid a visit to U.S. President Roosevelt and met for more than two hours. Afterwards, a joint statement was issued stating that the two had discussed war debts and various issues related to the World Economic Conference, but these were purely informal discussions and there were no concrete agreements reached. The British Ambassador did not formally present the British perspective, etc. Furthermore, it was stated that the talks only covered these issues. It is generally believed that the purpose of adding this last statement was likely to dispel rumors that the two had discussed the Manchurian case.</p>
<p>Peruvians Attack</p>

<p>League of Nations Executive Council to Meet and Mediate</p>
<p>Reuters, 20th - A dispatch from the capital of Chile today states that the Colombian Embassy in the capital of Peru was attacked by Peruvians on Saturday and Sunday nights. On Sunday night, the entire embassy was looted, and the minister and his family sought refuge in the Chilean Embassy and are planning to return home by plane.</p>
<p>Reuters, 21st - The League of Nations Executive Council, originally scheduled to meet yesterday to address the dispute between Colombia and Peru, ultimately postponed it to today to allow the Peruvian representative to arrive from Paris. However, at today's meeting, the Peruvian representative was still absent. The chairman, the Italian representative Aloisi, stated that it was quite unusual for one of the parties involved to not be present to make a statement and that the absent representative was responsible to the League of Nations and his country. After the Colombian representative read a lengthy statement, the council instructed a three-member committee to work with both parties to find a basis for compromise.</p>
<p>Assassin of Roosevelt</p>
<p>Sentenced to Eighty Years in Prison</p>
<p>The Assassin Loudly Proclaims the Sentence is Too Light</p>
<p>Reuters, 20th - Zangara, the assassin who attempted to assassinate President-elect Roosevelt last week, injuring the mayor of Chicago and several others, has been sentenced to eighty years in prison. Zangara was convicted on four counts, each carrying a twenty-year sentence. Before the sentencing, Zangara attempted to reduce the charges related to accidentally injuring Mrs. Cross and the child Clowe, but the judge refused. Therefore, all four charges against Zangara were upheld. Previously, it was expected that he might escape justice by claiming insanity, but this is now hopeless. Zangara then stated to the court, "I have suffered from stomach problems for a long time. I do not want capitalists to seize money. When I read in the newspaper that Mr. Roosevelt was coming here, I decided to kill him. My only purpose was to assassinate Mr. Roosevelt, not anyone else. I aimed at Mr. Roosevelt, but someone touched my arm, causing me to misfire. They are fools! Why didn't they let me kill Roosevelt?" After the sentencing, as Zangara was being led out of the courtroom, he shouted, "How stingy! A hundred years would be fine!"</p>
<p>United States</p>
<p>Drastically Cuts Naval Expenditures</p>
<p>Naval Strength Unaffected</p>
<p>Washington, 20th - Despite warnings from U.S. naval officers that naval effectiveness should not be weakened, the House Appropriations Committee today significantly reduced naval expenditures, declaring that naval sailors might as well eat more beans. It is estimated that this year's budget will be reduced by $26,271,120, leaving only $302,635,021, a massive reduction unseen in decades. The review report stated that Chinese Representative Makes Another Statement on Japan (4)</p>
<p>The Spirit of the Treaty of Portsmouth</p>
<p>Three</p>
<p>In his speech at the special assembly meeting on December 8, the Japanese representative denied that the Japanese military's invasion of Manchuria was a pre-planned scheme by Japanese military leaders with the aim of territorial aggression. He claimed that all levels of the Japanese people fully supported the actions of the military leaders, and that there was absolutely no opposition from the entire nation. However, the fact is that the military in Tokyo is currently implementing a policy of terror. If any person dares to oppose the military's "iron and blood" policy, death or exile will immediately follow. We still remember the four major assassinations that occurred in Japan in the past few months. The victims were two former Japanese prime ministers and leaders of the two major Japanese political parties, and one was a prominent leader of a financial group. These assassinations are a manifestation of the abrupt advance of Japanese militarism and are a genuine threat to peace in the Far East and the world.</p>
<p>When Mr. Matsuoka spoke at the assembly, he also claimed that he had made a detailed study of the Chinese problem, gaining much insight. He also said, "I dare to predict that China will not be unified within ten years and will not have a central government. (As an Oriental, I feel very regretful about this.) Perhaps this expectation will not be achieved in twenty years, or even in my lifetime." Those in China who know Mr. Matsuoka are aware that his long-term study of the Chinese problem is not aimed at increasing understanding of China and promoting China's legitimate aspirations, but at facilitating Japan's aggression. It is excessive to spend too much on the navy, advocating for: (1) placing old battleships and cruisers in reserve as soon as new ships are built; (2) abolishing the position of Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Aviation; (3) canceling onboard film screenings; (4) reducing the cost of meals for soldiers from 42 cents per day to 38 cents, stating that beans are very beneficial to people and the navy should eat more of them; (5) abolishing special stipends for aides-de-camp in admirals' offices; (6) reducing the public expenses of naval attachés abroad by 50%; (7) reducing aircraft procurement costs by 400,000 yuan. However, the committee made an important concession, stipulating that the Navy's Chief Commander, Plunkett, would continue to receive full pay after his retirement due to old age, so that he could be consulted on important naval matters at any time, because Mr. Plunkett had greatly helped to economize naval expenditures. The review report also stated that the actual effectiveness of the navy had not been weakened and that the Marine Corps would be able to maintain its current strength. However, the salaries of civilian clerks employed in naval shipyards should be reduced by 30%, because the current salaries are 30% higher than the salaries of the same grade in private shipyards. It was also said that it is not appropriate to only make the soldiers suffer hardships on warships; senior officers should also make significant changes to extravagant equipment. Reuters, 21st - A correspondent for the New York Times in San Francisco commented on the recently completed naval maneuvers, stating that Admiral Leigh, commander of the U.S. fleet, emphatically stated today that the United States now needs to build new ships, especially destroyers and submarines to replace old ones, and to increase the number of cruisers. It is reported that Admiral Leigh declared that Japan has more of all types of warships than the United States, except for battleships, where the numbers are equal.</p>
<p>Arms Sales Incident</p>
<p>Austria Takes a Hard Line</p>
<p>Vienna, 20th - Austrian Deputy Chancellor Winkler issued a statement today, expressing Austria's determination to immediately reject the protests from Britain and France regarding the Hindenburg arms case. Winkler stated, "No matter how small and defenseless Austria is, it will not tolerate this humiliating demand. Moreover, Austria is a member of the League of Nations, so if other countries are dissatisfied with Austria, they can submit it to the League of Nations for public judgment, rather than directly threatening the Austrian government."</p>
<p>Rome, 20th - The Italian newspaper "Stampa" of Milan published shocking news today, stating that "In the past three years, a large arms factory in Czechoslovakia's Gotta region has shipped a large number of arms to Yugoslavia, including 3,000 machine guns and 600 artillery pieces, including 20 heavy guns, as well as a large amount of ammunition." The arms factory in Czechoslovakia's Gotta region is a business affiliated with the large French Schneider-Creusot arms factory, and the shipment of these arms into Yugoslavia is still ongoing, completely unaffected by the Geneva disarmament conference. What's even stranger is that most of these arms pass through Austria, because Austria is forced to temporarily ignore the treaty. France, as the mastermind behind these arms shipments, turns a blind eye, but protests against the small number of damaged weapons transported from Italy to Austria for repair, causing international turmoil. It is truly a strange thing.</p>
<p>Michigan Declares State of Emergency</p>
<p>Reuters, 21st - The Michigan State Legislature today declared a state of emergency. This move gives the governor virtually dictatorial powers to extend the recently declared bank holiday or restrict depositors from withdrawing funds from banks.</p>
<p>of traditional policies. Mr. Matsuoka is one of the most ardent advocates of this policy. In his book "The Shaking of the East Asian Situation," pages 110-111, he highly praised Tanaka's aggressive policy towards Manchuria and Mongolia, calling it "the traditional policy of the Japanese Empire." This shows a glimpse of his views.</p>
<p>Mr. Matsuoka completely agreed with Tanaka's policy and said, "Whenever we have the opportunity, we should proceed step by step to create our country's position in Manchuria and Mongolia. Under no circumstances must we fail to create a superior position in Manchuria and Mongolia."</p>
<p>In another book he wrote, "Dynamic Manchuria," page 5 and subsequent pages, Mr. Matsuoka said, "When we talk about the Manchurian and Mongolian problem, we should discuss it together with the Korean problem and the problems of Siberia and the three maritime provinces of Soviet Russia. We should not discuss them separately."</p>
<p>Mr. Matsuoka's prediction of China's future seems very confident. The reason for this is definitely not because he believes that the situation in China is truly pessimistic. Observers from other countries have views that are completely contrary to Mr. Matsuoka's. Mr. Matsuoka's thoughts are likely the product of his desires. The Chinese delegation once submitted a memorandum to the inquiry committee, stating, "Japan is obstructing China's unification plan." It contained statements about the plots of Japanese warlords and their followers to obstruct China's unification. The purpose of the Japanese military in Tokyo and the General Staff Headquarters sending personnel to China to engage in various political schemes, financial endeavors, arms supplies, and even military interference is nothing more than to create political chaos in China, so that Japan can claim to be the guarantor of peace in the Far East and implement its planned policy of territorial development in China. Mr. Matsuoka deeply knows the activities of Japan and the meanings contained in these policies, and his loyalty to Japan's traditional aggressive and developmental policies is not limited to domestic and foreign propaganda.</p>
<p>Liu Xiang to Become the Leader of Western Sichuan</p>
<p>Deng and Tian are Carrying Out the Great Unity of All Generals</p>
<p>The Two Lius' Expedition to Suppress Bandits Seems to Be Effective</p>
<p>Correspondent from Chongqing: Although the Sichuan war has ceased for many days, new changes have been brewing secretly recently. The Sichuan Political Consolidation Committee established by the central government has failed. Zhang Qun, who was ordered by the National Government to return to Sichuan to reorganize Sichuan's politics, has sent letters to various generals, expressing that he has decided not to return to Sichuan, and requested that the Sichuan affairs be handled peacefully by the various generals. Therefore, the entire Sichuan situation is still in a state of neither life nor death. The one who can break through the silence and prevent the various armies from continuing the civil war is the Red Bandit in northern Sichuan, whose power is vast and about to spread throughout Sichuan. Therefore, the "suppression of the Red Bandit" has become the slogan of the current warlords. As for the current situation in Sichuan, a brief overview is as follows: Warlords Prepare to Swear an Oath of Blood Among the Sichuan generals, there were originally factions such as the Baoding, Speed Training, and Military Officer systems. Initially, members of each faction were extremely incompatible due to conflicts of interest. Since this great war, the generals of each faction have felt the need for practical unity. Therefore, Deng Xihou, Tian Songyao, and Liu Wenhui in Chengdu have implemented a great unity of the Baoding system. Liu Xiang and Yang Sen in Chongqing are also uniting the Speed Training system. Li Qixiang and Luo Zezhou initiated a grand alliance of the Military Officer system in Suining. For a time, the Sichuan situation became a tripartite balance of power. Then, Deng Xihou sent representative Li Guanghan, and Tian Songyao sent Yu Anmin, to meet Liu Xiang in Chongqing and Yang Sen in Guang'an to discuss expanding the unity and forming the unity of all armies in Sichuan. After repeated consultations, Liu Xiang was finally designated as the leader, emulating the Eastern Zhou states. When the Sichuan Provincial Post-War Conference is held, an altar will be built, and all army generals will unanimously swear an oath of blood, establish a Post-War Committee, produce chairmen and vice-chairmen, and establish five offices: Military, Civil, Education, Construction, and Finance, as well as an Oversight Yuan. Then, in accordance with the governance outline of the 94 generals, they will implement them one by one. Currently, Liu Xiang is leading the way, soliciting the opinions of other armies and discussing the location of the Post-War Conference. It is heard that there are already signs of progress. Generally, all army generals in Sichuan will gather in Jianzhou (150 miles from the provincial city) to hold a meeting. The date of the meeting has also been decided by all parties and is scheduled to be held in early March. Whether the future war in Sichuan can be eliminated by this meeting is difficult to predict. Red Flames Blaze Daily The armies mobilize for congratulations After the Red Army Xu Xiangqian, Kuang Jixun, and other groups captured Tongjiang, Nanjiang, Bazhong, Wuxi, and Chengkou in northern Sichuan, they fled to the border areas of Sichuan and Gansu, and established a Soviet pseudo-government in Tongnanba, with Li Cishan as chairman. The Red Army also advocates for a worker-peasant dictatorship, so the chairman of Bazhong County is specially elected as a carpenter, the chairman of Nanjiang County is elected as a stonemason, and the chairman of Tongjiang County is elected as a farmer. As for the people in northern Sichuan, who are poor and barren, and have been groaning under the iron hooves of warlords, they have been forced to take risks and attach to the Red Army. There are so many who joined the Red Army that Tian Songyao has not been able to fundamentally eradicate them since he raised troops to suppress the bandits. After the central government appointed Tian as the bandit suppression commissioner of Sichuan and Shaanxi, Tian became more and more courageous and besieged the Red Army with about two-thirds of his army, about 20,000 people, but still failed. Now, Yang Sen of the 20th Army and Deng Xihou of the 28th Army, fearing that the Red Army would infiltrate their defense areas, have specially dispatched 15 regiments to assist Tian's army in suppressing the bandits. Liu Xiang of the 21st Army and Liu Wenhui of the 24th Army, stationed in Pinging and Chongqing, have also declared their willingness to dispatch 15 regiments to help Tian suppress the bandits. However, it is said that the two Lius are plotting to take advantage of the situation to occupy Tian's territory. Tian Songyao said that those who claim to help him are mostly acting with ulterior motives and politely declined, saying that his army could completely eliminate the Red Army. At the same time, Tian was afraid that Liu Wenhui would want to avenge his defeat and take advantage of the emptiness in the rear defenses to advance into Sichuan. Therefore, he still left more than 20,000 elite soldiers in the rear to defend against Liu. Therefore, the Red Army became more rampant. In short, the warlords are deadlocked, causing the Red Army to grow and bring disaster to the people, which is truly painful. (February 19)</p>
<p>Cai Tingkai Arrives in Fuzhou</p>
<p>Discussing Plans for Resisting Japan and Suppressing Communists with Jiang Guangnai</p>
<p>Taking Office as the Left Route Commander-in-Chief of the Bandit Suppression Army in the Border Areas of Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Fujian</p>
<p>Fuzhou News: Cai Tingkai returned to Zhangzhou from Guangdong on the 11th and arrived in the province from Zhangzhou on the 15th. That night, he and Provincial Government Chairman Jiang Guangnai, Huang Renhuan representing Chen Jitang, Suijing Office Chief of Staff Deng Shizeng, and 78th Division Commander Qu Shounian, etc., at the Shuibu Sanqiao Club, discussed the joint anti-Japanese and communist suppression plans of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian provinces. It is said that the results were quite satisfactory. Huang Renhuan returned to Guangdong on the 16th to report back. Cai also telegraphed on the same day to announce his assumption of the position of Left Route Commander-in-Chief of the Bandit Suppression Army in the border areas of Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Fujian, and dispatched Qu Shounian to Yanping, Shaowu, and Shunchang in northern Fujian to inspect the deployment of various troops, so as to plan an encirclement and suppression with the troops of Guangdong and Jiangxi provinces. As for this Guangzhou meeting, according to Cai's remarks, it can be roughly said that the first step of the organization of the Southwest National Defense Committee is to consolidate the national defense of the coastal provinces in the southwest, so that the enemy does not dare to invade. The second step is to prepare to send troops north to resist the enemy when necessary. As for the 19th Route Army, it has always been committed to resisting Japan and suppressing communists. As soon as the central government's order arrives, it can be dispatched immediately. It does not need anyone's urging. However, before it is dispatched, it is determined to clear the Red Army in the border areas of Fujian and Jiangxi in a short period of time, so as to avoid future worries. I have returned to Fujian this time to urge the troops to advance and suppress, so as to be able to eliminate them within the time limit." As for the bandits who fled from Jiangxi to Fujian, they are now concentrated in Jianning, Taining, Guangze, and Chong'an in northern Fujian, with a total of about 20,000 people, belonging to the four groups of Zhu De, Lin Biao, Peng Dehuai, and Fang Zhimin. The National Army stationed in Shaowu, Jiangle, Jianyang, and Pucheng is Zhang Yan, Jiang Yan, Gui Zhenyuan, Liu Shangzhi, Zhou Zhiqun, and Zhang Luanji. Six brigades of soldiers who were previously stationed in Pucheng Zhang Luanji's brigade were ordered by division commander Liu Zhennian to go to Guangfeng in eastern Jiangxi to station. The Suijing Office has transferred Qian Yuguang's brigade to fill the defense. Now, waiting for Cai's order, the general offensive can begin. As for the bandit forces in Changting and Liancheng in western Fujian, they are extremely weak. Zhang Zhen, Shen Guanghan, Qu Shounian, and Huang Renhuan's four divisions have each dispatched a part to attack from Yongding, Longyan, Zhangping, and Shanghang. Once the troops arrive, they can be recovered. (February 17)</p>

Because Li does not care about life, she now relies on her maternal uncle, Tang Rugui, who works in the health department of the Shanghai Municipal Council, for her livelihood. Recently, she filed a lawsuit with the Wuxian District Court, demanding that Li Genyuan pay 10,000 yuan in alimony. However, due to financial difficulties, she applied for assistance with litigation costs. The Wuxian Court opened the trial yesterday (21st) morning. Cheng Peiyi responded to the summons and went to the court with her defense lawyer Zhu Fucheng to report. Li Genyuan did not arrive. The judge questioned her once and waited for Li to be summoned to the court for further questioning.</p>

<p>Actively Widening the Roads in the Four Villages</p>
<p>In recent years, the construction industry in the county has developed rapidly. The opening and widening of roads in the four villages is the most active, but it is more difficult to handle in the urban area. Therefore, the widening of Sanbu a matter has been going on for a long time and has not yet been implemented. Although it has been urged by the Party Department, it has not been realized due to the opposition of many people. There are three construction projects in the county that will start soon: (1) The sidewalk at the intersection of Xicheng Road has been bid on, and paving can begin as soon as the road is slightly dry. (2) A section of road from outside the South Gate to Nanfangquan in the Fourteenth District was started yesterday. (3) A section of road from the urban area to Zhangjing Bridge in the Seventh District (namely Xijing Road) has been actively rushing to create a requisition list. As soon as it is completed, construction can begin, piling up soil and adding coal ash to implement traffic to facilitate transportation.</p>

<p>Lake Bandits Bai Shou Robs Sailing Ships</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at about 8:00 AM, a sailing ship from Doujiahui in the northern countryside of Lake Changxing sailed to the lake. When passing Xinba near Beigao Bridge, a bandit ship suddenly came. There were seven or eight bandits. One bandit held a submachine gun, one held a not gun, and the rest were empty-handed. They ordered the sailing ship to stop. The bandits boarded the ship and searched the passengers one by one. None of the more than 20 people on board were spared. It is estimated that 16 pieces of Huzhou silk and more than 20 yuan in silver were robbed. After the robbery, the bandits took the original ship and drove north. Afterwards, the boat owner A Shui reported to the Xiaomei Water Police Team and requested a pursuit.</p>

<p>The Zhengtai Rubber First Manufacturing Factory, located at No. 1250 Tangshan Road at the end of the city, suddenly experienced an accident at 9:30 AM yesterday morning, just as male and female workers were working. Due to the electric wire in the glazing room of the first workshop short-circuiting, the fire immediately spread to the glazing oil pre-set there (this glazing oil is a mixture of gasoline and flammable raw materials). As a result, the flames spread instantly, and the engine boiler also exploded immediately with a loud bang. The entire building shook, and the entire factory building immediately collapsed. Flames erupted, turning into an uncontrollable prairie fire. When fire trucks from various districts arrived, all the male and female workers on the scene had already been buried in the fire pit. According to an investigation after the incident, as of 8:00 PM last night, as many as 76 charred and burned male and female worker corpses had been recovered from the fire scene, and 74 people were injured. There is still the lowest level, which must wait to be unearthed today before the exact number can be known. As for the factory's losses, they are estimated to be more than 100,000 yuan. It is truly an unprecedented tragedy in this city. The various situations obtained by this newspaper's reporter's investigation are compiled and recorded separately below.</p>
<h3>All Party Branches Abolished</h3>

It has been decided to establish party affairs organs in counties with a larger number of party members and better transportation, totaling over thirty locations throughout the province. The staff will be concurrently held by members of public halls, without involving county government officials to avoid manipulation. Following central government guidelines, a reasonable amount of operating expenses will be provided, divided into three levels: 300 yuan, 240 yuan, and 200 yuan.

<p>Zhou Zhenlin's Speech in Nanjing</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhou Zhenlin said, "I have not participated in national affairs for several years. Now that the central government is preparing to implement constitutional government and is determined to resist aggression, which coincides with my long-held beliefs, I have come to Nanjing to take office. I recall that in the past, whenever our party suffered the sacrifice of a comrade, the entire nation grieved. However, since the split between the Kuomintang and the Communists in 1927, countless outstanding young people have been killed on suspicion of being communists, which seems insignificant. This is extremely heartbreaking. Changing course is essential for our party's future. Our country is an ancient civilization with vast land and a large population, unmatched in the world. Yet, we are being bullied by an island nation, which is extremely shameful. In my humble opinion, although our guns and bullets are far less sophisticated than those of the enemy, if we can unite the entire nation and use the blood and flesh of 400 million compatriots to wage a long-term war of resistance against the violent Japanese, the final victory will belong to us. Therefore, such extreme humiliation can only be washed away with blood and flesh. However, it is difficult to resist foreign aggression if the country is not at peace internally. Therefore, the reorganization of domestic affairs cannot be delayed. I will leave Nanjing for Shanghai on the evening of the 22nd and will come to Nanjing often in the future."

<h3>Business Conditions</h3>
<p>Zhengtai Rubber Manufacturing Factory is a partnership, an unlimited company, formerly Yichang Company four years ago, specializing in the production of Eight Auspicious Signs brand rubber overshoes. Later, due to the development of its business, it built the Zhengtai Rubber Factory at the corner of Tangshan Road and Dalianwan Road, specializing in rubber materials and rubber shoes.

The First Factory, where the accident occurred today, can produce more than 8,000 pairs of rubber shoes every day, working day and night. Manager Huang Jianqing and First Factory Director Zheng Juren are indeed the larger of the rubber factories.

<h3>He De Kui's Remarks</h3>
<p>A reporter from the Central News Agency, seeking to understand the attitude of the Shanghai Municipal Council regarding the water fee dispute, yesterday morning specifically visited He De Kui of the Shanghai Municipal Council. According to him, the price increase for tap water in the International Settlement has caused a dispute, and this matter is of great importance. Therefore, the Shanghai Municipal Council is conducting research with the Waterworks Company authorities to find a solution, which is currently underway. The Chinese directors are extremely concerned about this matter and hope to take into account the vital interests of the citizens and find an appropriate solution. As for the Taiping faucets in the already disconnected areas, they can be used publicly, and there should be no fear of running out of water. As for the municipal government authorities, it is said that they have also expressed their opinions.</p>
<p>Water Line Negotiations</p>
<p>Will Have Special Developments</p>
<p>Great Northern Company to Pay Large Landing Fee for Submarine Cables</p>
<p>Remarks by Mr. Nelson</p>
<p>The negotiation of the submarine cable issue between the Ministry of Communications and the Great Northern Telegraph Company has been pending for a long time. A person named Nelson, who had worked for the company for twenty-one years, spoke with this newspaper's reporter last night about the company's placement of submarine cables in China and the future trend of its resolution. According to him, as early as 1869, the first Inspector-General of Customs in China, Robert Hart, ceded Gutzloff Island, 60 miles outside the mouth of the Wusong River, to the Danish company Great Northern. The company's submarine cables gained landing rights on the island. There are six submarine cables landing on the island, but no rent has ever been paid to the Chinese government. Now that this issue is being negotiated between the Great Northern Company and the Ministry of Communications, the only condition for its resolution is that the Great Northern Company should pay the National Government an annual rent of at least 500,000 taels in the future. As the company has been operating in China for more than 60 years since 1869 without paying a single tael of rent, it should also be required to pay arrears, calculated at 500,000 taels per year, for a total of 30 million taels.</p>
<p>He Bingxian</p>
<p>Talks About Trade with Russia</p>
<p>Establishing a Trade Company with Russia</p>
<p>People's Investment Subject to Government Control</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, since the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia, the quantity of Russian goods imported into China has gradually expanded. The Ministry of Industry believes that Russia's trade with China is purely state-owned, so China's trade with Russia also intends to adopt state-owned operation. A reporter from the Central News Agency yesterday specifically visited He Bingxian, Director of the International Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, to inquire about the truth of this matter. According to Director He, all foreign trade of Soviet Russia is under state control, and exports are based on standards that do not hinder their own needs, while imports are based on necessities. Therefore, Russia's trade with China is active, while China's trade with Russia is passive. Russia's foreign trade is state-owned, and under the planned economic system, a whole plan is predetermined, and then foreign trade is operated according to the whole plan. This kind of trade is planned trade, while China's foreign trade is free operation, which is unplanned trade. Compared with Russia's active and planned trade, China's passive and unplanned trade is undoubtedly doomed to failure. The main categories of goods exported from China to Russia are soybeans and tea, with soybeans averaging 76.22% of the total export volume and tea accounting for 9.42%. Soybeans and tea together account for 85.64%. Since the three northeastern provinces were occupied by the Japanese, China's soybean exports have become almost zero. In other words, China's trade with Russia has in fact been reduced by 76%. Without other developments, China's long-standing trade surplus with Russia will immediately turn into a trade deficit. Based on the above reasons and facts, the bleak prospects for China's trade with Russia are undeniable. Therefore, for the sake of the future of China's trade with Russia, it is imperative to quickly formulate a trade plan with Russia. Regarding the plan for trade with Russia, I firmly advocate that first, trade with Russia must be based on the principle of state-owned operation, and second, the northwest should be developed immediately. State-owned trade with Russia can be said to be planned trade, and the development of the northwest can enrich China's strength in trade with Russia. Because of my responsibilities, I have contributed this opinion to the Ministry of Industry, and the Ministry also intends to adopt it. As for the method of state-owned trade with Russia, it is planned to first establish a trade company with Russia, with people freely investing in trade, but it must be subject to government regulation and supervision. This method is currently being drafted by me, and once the draft is completed, it can be submitted to the Ministry for adoption and implementation.</p>

<p>The Municipal Party Department Sends a Telegram to Encourage Northern China Generals</p>
<p>The Municipal Party Department yesterday replied to the telegram to the generals in North China, urgently: To Comrade Zhang Hanqing in Beiping, transferred to all generals, division commanders, and brigade commanders, for your perusal. The violent Japanese bandits have invaded, the Northeast has fallen, and they are swallowing up our territory like a boar and a long snake. In order to seek the extension of public justice, the generals have tolerated humiliation and carried heavy burdens, and have retreated in the past, so as to clarify what is injustice; resisting in the future, so as to clarify what is responsibility. With a righteous army, we are strong; with careful planning, we move. With the spirit of unyielding and indomitable spirit, we make continuous efforts. The reputation you have established is admired by the world. I hope that you will train your troops to resist the powerful bandits, wash away the humiliation of Kuaiji, and avenge the shame of Lu. Then, not only will the country have a time of recovery, but also your good names will be restored. Right and wrong, righteousness and wickedness, are all clear. Success or failure, profit or loss, lies in every action. This committee dares to lead all the citizens of Shanghai to pledge our support. This is the reply to the telegram. We await the good news. Shanghai Special City Executive Committee, official seal.</p>

<p>The Chilean Government</p>
<p>Awards the Ambassador Li with a Medal</p>
<p>According to a dispatch from Santiago, the Chilean government believes that the Chinese Chargé d'Affaires to Chile, Li Shilin, has promoted harmony between the two countries during his four years in Chile.

Therefore, overseas Chinese in Chile have great faith in him.</p>
<p>The Women's Charitable Corps Urgently Produces Cotton Leggings</p>
<p>To Donate to the Northeast Volunteer Army to Protect Against the Cold</p>
<p>The Shanghai Women's Charitable Corps, recently received a report from Mrs. Zhang Puquan after returning from an inspection in the Northeast, learning that the Northeast Volunteer Army lacks warm clothing during the bloody resistance against Japan. As a result, most of them either froze to death on the battlefield or became disabled, and the situation was extremely cruel. All members of the corps then collected donations to urgently produce 200 sets of cotton leggings, which were sent to Ms. Huang Xuemei at Bowen Women's School on the 20th of this month, and transferred to the Northeast by Mrs. Zhang Puquan.</p>
<p>After Rice Carriers Went on Strike</p>
<p>The Social Bureau Attempted to Mediate Yesterday</p>
<p>Rice merchants opposed the heavy measure of the grain measurer, going on strike. Rice shops implemented the practice of using a smaller grain measure due to the light measure of the grain measurer. Grain measurers requested relief due to difficulties on both sides. Disputes over light and heavy measures in the rice industry in this city have been mediated by party and government organs, but due to the complexity of the situation, there has been no solution. The Shanghai South Rice Carriers Joint Benefit Association issued a declaration to go on strike due to the heavy measure of the grain measurer. Rice shops implemented the practice of using a smaller grain measure due to the light measure of the grain measurer. Grain measurers requested relief due to being exhausted and unable to bear the losses. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Government Mediation</p>
<p>The Social Bureau, believing that the strike of rice carriers in South Shanghai was related to the people's food and would affect local stability, sent Zhou Minggang of the Fourth Section to investigate the strike of rice carriers at 10:00 am yesterday to verify the matter. As for the case of grain measurers requesting the abolition of smaller measures, the Social Bureau convened a meeting for questioning at 1:00 pm yesterday, with Xu Jingzhi of the Rice Shop Trade Association present. Zhou Minggang of the Fourth Section and Zhu Guilin of the Third Section received them until about 2:00 pm before dispersing. It is reported that the practice of smaller measures has been followed by rice shops for a long time, and it is impossible to supervise the grain measurement on the ship by themselves.</p>
<p>Grain Measurers' Request</p>
<p>The entire body of grain measurers, after the Rice Industry Workers' Conference, resolved that rice shops did not comply with the standards and arbitrarily forced the use of smaller measures, causing the grain measurers to be exhausted and unable to bear the losses. They submitted a request to the主管署 (supervisory authority) to require rice shops to send personnel to supervise the grain measurement on the ship themselves, and to abolish the practice of smaller measures, otherwise, the boatmen should be ordered to allow the grain measurers to retain grain measuring挡 (measurement control). The reason is that recently, rice shops have purchased rice without complying with the standards of the city grain measure, mostly using the excuse of insufficient weight to request the use of smaller measures. Because of business relations, the industry had sent personnel to supervise the grain measurement on the ship, but they did not comment and only ordered the grain measurers to compensate enough to please customers. Therefore, the grain measurers were exhausted and unable to bear the losses. If this is not stopped quickly, it will inevitably cause disputes. It should be noted that the grain measurers are in a neutral position and have always lacked the power to be flexible for both parties in the transaction. They only have the standard of complying with the public regulations for grain measures, filling the measures and leveling them as the standard for daily work. Leveling the measures is something that outsiders do not understand, and there is slander everywhere. The grain measurers have endured humiliation for a long time. Moreover, the nature of rice is different, and the dryness and wetness are different. After the wet rice is measured, bagged, and sent by car, it must be reduced in weight after absorbing air. In addition, the carters may have human intentions, and it is inevitable that there will be waste along the way. All these invisible losses must be forcibly borne by the grain measurers, which cannot be said to be fair.</p>
<p>Dredging the Liu River War Zone Waterway</p>
<p>More Than 10,000 Workers</p>
<p>100,000 Yuan in Funding</p>
<p>Water Pumping to Be Implemented Today</p>
<p>The Liu River estuary waterway in the war zone is extremely silted up, and navigation is obstructed. The Jiangsu Provincial Conscription Dredging River Committee Liu River Branch has been handling the dredging. The large east-west dry dams of the river were built and dredged yesterday, and 16 water pumping machines have also been installed in sections. Starting today, water pumping will be implemented. If the weather does not change, it is expected that the entire river flow can be pumped dry in two weeks. The engineering section of the branch has measured the water level line of the entire section and has installed wooden stakes, bamboo slips, and signal flags in sections. As the Liu River is the end of the Lou River, traversing the east-west downstream section, the farmland, water conservancy, navigation, and transportation of Kunshan, Taicang, Jiading, and Baoshan are directly and indirectly benefited. Therefore, this conscription dredging river is undertaken by the above four counties, of which Taicang has the longest section to be dredged, and there are more than 10,000 conscripted laborers. The engineering section of the branch, in view of this, has advanced the construction measurement of the Taicang section. Recently, employees have been sent along the river to measure, and the amount of earthwork is being calculated. It is estimated that when the river water is pumped dry, the measurement of the construction section in each county can also be completed. Now, due to the urgency of time and the urgency of the work, the office, economic, and engineering sections of the branch are extremely busy. Regarding the engineering expenses, the estimated total amount is about 100,000 yuan in silver. The branch will raise 50,000 yuan on its own, and the remaining 50,000 yuan will be raised by the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction.</p>
<p>Five Provinces and Cities Protect Highways</p>
<p>And Handle Emergency Equipment</p>
<p>Regarding the highway affairs of the five provinces and cities, the Shanghai Municipal Government approved the letter from the preparatory office of the National Economic Commission, stating that highways in various places are being actively built, and the traffic of long-distance buses is also increasingly developed. However, the people in rural areas have not yet developed their knowledge, and it is inevitable that they will damage the highways and vehicles from time to time.</p>
<p>Five Provinces and Cities Protect Highways</p>
<p>And Handle Emergency Equipment</p>
<p>Regarding the highway affairs of the five provinces and cities, the Shanghai Municipal Government approved the letter from the preparatory office of the National Economic Commission, stating that highways in various places are being actively built, and the traffic of long-distance buses is also increasingly developed. However, the people in rural areas have not yet developed their knowledge, and it is inevitable that they will damage the highways and vehicles from time to time. A few days ago, the Transportation Committee of the five provinces and cities decided that the committee should send a letter to the provincial and municipal governments to order the village chiefs along the road to be responsible for compensation for any damage to highways and vehicles within their jurisdiction. The municipal government, after receiving the request, ordered the public security and public works bureaus to comply. It also stated that the Transportation Committee of the five provinces and cities, in order to plan for the safety of highway travelers, decided that each highway station should indicate the location of first aid, and that long-distance buses should be equipped with first aid medicines and sandboxes, etc. The above two items are important plans, and the corresponding letter requests that the highway long-distance bus companies and stations be ordered to handle them separately.</p>
<p>Nanshi Rice Carters</p>
<p>Request an Increase in Freight Rates</p>
<p>Rice trucks and small carts at the Xuejia浜 Rice Wharf in Nanshi specialize in delivering rice and grains from the various rice shops in this city. The fare is 7.8 cents per shi for short distances and 1 to 1.5 jiao for long distances. A few days ago, the rice carters claimed that the wages of rice trucks in Beishi had been increased by 30% by the rice shops in June last year, while the rice trucks in Nanshi had not been increased. Moreover, recently, the price of everything has been high, and life has been difficult. For example, the price of gasoline has been rising frequently, and the equipment and accessories on the trucks are mostly imported, and their prices are higher. Therefore, they went to the dedicated transportation office of the Shanghai Bean and Rice Trade Association yesterday, and resolutely stated to the cart leaders Ni Baolin and Pan Shuqing that they must issue and settle the freight charges according to the Beishi precedent, otherwise, they would have no choice but to stop work together. Ni and Pan repeatedly persuaded them to adopt a compromise method for the sake of maintaining a living. The rice stone, which is currently changed to the "zhi" system, is charged according to the original fare of the Qianhai measure, which is only half of the 30% increase, which is fair and avoids disputes. They also asked Chairman Lu of the Rice Shop Trade Association to notify the rice shops to understand the suffering of the carters and implement it quickly to avoid complications.</p>

<p>Assuming the Name of the Anti-Japanese Association</p>
<p>Fraudulently Obtaining 3,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Chen Yigen Accuses Tian Siwei</p>
<p>The two hardware stores, Senchang and Yichang, on Beijing Road, had enemy goods worth more than 20,000 yuan confiscated by the Anti-Japanese Association last year. The two store owners entrusted Chen Yigen to find Tian Siwei, who lived at No. 20, Shanle Lane, Julai Road, in the French Concession, and was in charge of the storage section of the Anti-Japanese Association, to find a way to get the goods back. Tian Siwei ordered the two stores to jointly pay a fine of 3,000 yuan. The two stores paid the money to Chen for transfer to Tian, and Tian issued a receipt. Later, the two went to retrieve the goods but could not find them. They also received a letter from the Anti-Japanese Association, instructing them to pay a fine of 1,000 yuan. Only then did they realize that Tian had fraudulently obtained the money. They had no choice but to pay another fine to retrieve the goods. On the one hand, they found Chen to reason with Tian and demanded the return of the 3,000 yuan previously paid. However, Tian had already spent the money and could not return it. Chen compensated them and repeatedly asked Tian for the money, but Tian refused to return it. Chen then hired lawyers Wang Hengyi and Ma Hongyuan to file a complaint with the Second Special District Court, accusing Tian Siwei of fraudulently obtaining property and requesting an investigation, with a private lawsuit attached to recover the defrauded money. The court accepted the complaint and held several hearings, but the defendant did not appear, and the case was postponed. Yesterday afternoon, they received a summons from Judge Zhang Chaozuo to open the Fifth Court. The defendant Tian Siwei and his defense lawyer appeared in court and were questioned. The court ordered that the hearing be adjourned to a later date.</p>
<p>The Mastermind of the Assassination of Jiang Guoxing</p>
<p>Sentenced to Death</p>

<p>Jiang Guoxing, a native of Haizhou, residing at No. 772, Yuanfang Lane, Yuanfang Road, Hongkou, was assassinated and killed by his enemies with guns and axes near the lane on the afternoon of January 29. The police investigation revealed that the cause of the incident was that the deceased had previously served as an informant for a detective in a certain police station and had a deep feud with Gu Qingbao, the king of flower clubs. Jiang also secretly reported and destroyed the opium den set up by Gu and his disciples, and also helped children in disputes, which led to the incident. Afterwards, the Chinese detective Lu Gengen and the Chinese detective Gui Shou, etc., arrested the perpetrators Ge Xiaoxiao from Jiangren and Gu Hairu from Tongzhou, along with suspects Miao Zubi, Shui Changgeng, and Li Xiaobao, and brought them to the First Special District District Court. After repeated investigations, the judgment date was reached yesterday morning. Judge Xiao Xiexuan and the Chief Prosecutor attended the Third Criminal Court and announced the judgment. Ge Xiaoxiao was sentenced to death, Gu Hairu was sentenced to life imprisonment, and Miao Zubi, Shui Changgeng, and Li Xiaobao were acquitted. The police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated that he would waive the appeal for Shui and Li, and they would be released. Miao Zubi requested to be remanded in custody during the appeal period, which was approved by the court.</p>

<p>Copies Calligraphy of Various Masters Very Lifelike</p>
<p>The National Art Exhibition held at the Hushi Society this time collected works by famous artists, which are beautiful and cannot be fully appreciated. Among them, the vertical axis couplets copied by the seven-year-old Bao Xunsi imitated the calligraphy of Liu Shian, Bao Shenbo, Deng Shiru, Chen Yufang, Zhang Jizhi, Lu Fengshi, and Weng Shuping, all of which are very lifelike. Therefore, the exhibition had not yet closed, and all of his work was sold out. It is reported that this child is from Shexian, Anhui. His father, Mr. Ji Tang (Geng), entered school as a child and was able to write poetry in less than half a year. Now he is famous in the political world. His uncle, Mr. Lou Xian, was able to paint at the age of seven and was proficient in calligraphy at the age of nine. His morality and writings are admired by the scholars.

The whole family is excellent, and it is no wonder that the child is born intelligent.</p>
<p>The Ferry Across the River on Dongmen Road</p>
<p>Will Directly Arrive at Dongchang Road Starting Tomorrow</p>
<p>The area around Dongchang Road (that is, Laiyi Ferry) in Pudong is the most prosperous area on the left bank of the Huangpu River, with more than 10,000 passengers daily. However, the old-fashioned ferry boats are old and dilapidated, and transportation is deeply inconvenient. The city-run Dongmen Road ferry line was originally scheduled to run directly from Dongmen Road to Dongchang Road, but the negotiation of the Dongchang Road pier was delayed. Therefore, the Pudong side temporarily docked at the Lujia渡 pier. Recently, the negotiation of the Dongchang Road pier has come to an end, and the prepared steel ferry floating pier has also been installed. The city-run cross-river ferry has decided to use the newly built ferries running at both ends from February 23, directly from Dongmen Road to Dongchang Road. Each crossing of the Huangpu River only takes one minute, which will not only facilitate the merchants and travelers there, but also benefit the development of the city.</p>

<p>Approximately 600,000 Bags</p>
<p>Recently, the Beiyang帮客家(merchant group) has purchased a large batch of flour in Shanghai. According to the investigation, more than 800,000 bags were shipped from Shanghai to Tianjin, Dalian, and other places last month (January), causing the factories in this city to be unable to deliver the goods in time. The situation was slightly relaxed this month, but recently it has become active again. It is reported that there are currently 500,000 to 600,000 bags waiting to be shipped. It is learned that two British ships exported more than 130,000 bags yesterday, and two ships will also export 150,000 bags today.

<p>The Local Autonomy Training Institute</p>
<p>The Alumni Association Issues a Declaration</p>
<p>The Alumni Association of the Shanghai Local Autonomy Training Institute issued a declaration to promote local autonomy in this city, stating that local autonomy is a basic task during the period of political tutelage. The Third Plenary Session also advocated the strict implementation of local autonomy and issued orders to the provinces to actively promote it. However, although the preparation of this city has been going on for several years, and the division of districts and boundaries has been completed, the district offices that bear direct responsibility have not yet been established, so all social undertakings cannot be carried out, and the meaning of political tutelage will have no destination. How can the new society of the Three Principles of the People be realized? Now the central government is already preparing for the work of the constitutional period, such as the drafting of the constitution and the convening of the National Senate, all of which are being actively carried out to realize the constitution. However, to guide people to the constitution, political tutelage must be the basis, otherwise, abandoning the foundation and pursuing the end is no different from climbing a tree to catch fish. The result will inevitably suffer the same fate as the early years of the Republic. Therefore, in order to seek the true right of the masses to exercise their four powers, and to move towards the constitution to realize the new society of the Three Principles of the People, it is necessary to complete local autonomy. The students of this association, deeply influenced by the training of the municipal government, are deeply concerned about the autonomy of this city. At this time of national crisis, without a solid foundation for local autonomy, it is not enough to resist foreign aggression, and Shanghai should be a model for all provinces and cities, setting an example for autonomy. How can it be allowed to follow in the footsteps of others and willingly lag behind? This is what the students of this association sincerely pray for, and especially hope that the advanced people from all walks of life will unanimously advocate and promote its realization. This declaration is hereby made, and we hope that you will understand.</p>
<p>Nanshi Rice Merchant Association's General Assembly</p>
<p>The Shanghai Nanshi Rice Merchant Association held a general meeting of all members in the Cuixiu Hall of the Yuyuan Garden in the city at 10:00 am yesterday. More than 160 members from 20帮(merchant groups), including Zhang Wenbai from Tongli, Pang Bosen, Xu Yinfu from Wujiang, Chen Junyu from Suzhou, Lv Shaoyun from Pingwang, Zhang Shounian from Beizhuanzha, Zhuang Fangsheng from Qingbo, Cheng Huandou from Zhujing, Luo Liangcai from Pinghu, Ma Fangmei from Xincang, Xu Junyuan from Liantang, Xu Beichen from Fengjing, Hu Zuomin from Shengze, Wang Yuzhou from Xitang, Sheng Hesheng from Xiexie, and Wang Shourong from Ruanxiang, Lin Bingjuan from Zhujiaxing, Zou Xingya from Zhouzhuang, Yan Xiaoquan from Shanghai, Zhu Zixiang, Chen Qinsheng, and others attended the meeting as scheduled. Yan Xiaoquan, Pang Bosen, Chen Junyu, Luo Liangcai, Xu Beichen, Zhang Jingzhai, Mao Zhiyi, Zhuang Fangsheng, and Zhang Shounian were publicly elected as the presidium, with Wang Disheng recording. After Chairman Yan Xiaoquan reported the purpose of the meeting, the following was discussed: (1) Whether the six-dou(measure) city measure is applicable to government orders proposed by Tongli Xiguangfeng. It was resolved that rice shops in Shanghai are allowed to use the five-dou(measure) city measure, and all six-dou(measure) city measures are abolished. As for the bagging aspect, it is convenient to use the six-dou(measure) city measure as needed. (2) The proposal to reduce commissions was resolved that the Municipal Social Bureau had ordered a reduction of two points. (3) Whether the dedicated wharf for the rice industry has fully reimbursed the advance payment was resolved that a letter should be sent to the Bean and Rice Association for a detailed reply. (4) The letters from the Tongli, Wujiang, Qingpu, Fengjing, Pinghu, and other associations requesting clarification of the卸合(measurement differential) issue were discussed together. It was resolved that all ports should load and unload with the city measure, and after arriving in Shanghai, the city measure should be delivered, and it was stipulated that two sheng(unit) per stone should be allowed in deference to the boatmen. (5) Rice boats from various ports are being blocked on the way to Shanghai, fearing that they will lose their capital. It was resolved that a letter should be sent to the Bean and Rice Industry Association requesting the Social Bureau for emergency sanctions in order to protect the capital of the various帮(merchant groups). (6) Chen Junyu proposed temporarily that boatmen require the use of the city measure to change to a漏斗(funnel). It was resolved that the Southern measure to change to a funnel is naturally sanctioned by the authorities, and it is not within the power of this association to weigh it. The boatmen should apply to the party and government organs themselves.</p>

<p>In Front of the Golden Theatre</p>
<p>The Robbery and Murder of a Police Officer Case Goes to Trial</p>
<p>Zhu Chunlin, a native of Changzhou, who runs a butcher shop at No. 1, Fuxing Lane, Baer Road, Nanyang Bridge, French Concession, went to the Great World with a friend on the evening of the 30th of last month. He left the venue at 1:30 am and went home. When he passed the back door of the Killing Cow Company at the intersection of Glock Road and Lagnag Road, he suddenly encountered two robbers who stopped him and robbed him of a Walter呢(fabric) jacket and 1.2 yuan in his pocket. Zhu followed the robbers to the side door of the Golden Theatre at the intersection of Mintine Y路(road) and Fada馬路(road). He saw Chinese Constable Wang Weigui No. 614 and reported to the constable. The constable chased and ordered the robbers to stop for a search. The robber in a suit opened fire and refused to be arrested. The bullet hit Constable Wang's head and he was injured. He died soon after. Superintendent Jin Jiulin of the Special Agency, Detective Zhang Ziquan, Detective Bao Li Jinzhang, and other constables, along with Yue Constable No. 181 and Chinese Constable No. 350, heard the alarm and rushed to the scene. They arrested one robber, Yu Zurong, and arrested the robber who fired the shot, Zheng Ziming, at the staircase of the Siming Hotel on Xizilai火街(street). They found a pistol and bullets and sent them to the Second Special District Court for investigation and detention. The previous report has been recorded. It is now learned from Detective Bao that the two robbers, Yu and Zheng, had colluded with Tang Xinghua and three others who were at large, and had robbed the coats and fur coats of Wang</p>
<h3>Factory Building Location</h3>
<p>The factory has its staff offices along Tangshan Road.  Further in is a workshop that is ten "ma" (a unit of length) long and rectangular.  Passing through the workshop is the steaming room.  The building is Western style, divided into two stories.  The machinery and boiler are installed downstairs, and the upstairs is where the female workers work, consisting of two buildings, each with four rooms. Behind the steaming room are two more factory buildings, the style of which is the same as the previous ones.  Both upstairs and downstairs in these buildings are where the workers work.  Normally, the workers enter and exit through a narrow alley next to the office building.  A few days ago, the Fire Brigade ordered the addition of an emergency exit, as the factory had too few exits. According to people from the factory, the emergency exit was just completed a few days ago.  Unfortunately, this tragedy occurred. The factory has a total of over one thousand male and female workers. Among them, those in the second factory on Rulianwan Road include over four hundred female workers and two hundred male workers.  Those in the first factory on Tangshan Road include two hundred and seventy-six female workers and one hundred and forty-five male workers.  The most heavily burned area was the coating room, with a total of one hundred and fifty-six female workers (six of whom were on leave).  There were thirteen rectangular tables, with twelve female workers seated at each table.  In addition, there were nine male workers. Regarding the cause of the accident: at 9:30 yesterday morning, the female workers in the coating room were busily at work when a short circuit caused a fire, igniting more than ten barrels of gasoline nearby.  Instantly, the entire room was ablaze.  At the same time, the lower floor of the building housed the boiler room and the gasoline materials. When the fire spread to the boiler room, the boiler exploded with a deafening roar. With the boiler's explosion, the powerful shock caused the entire factory building to collapse. At that time, the gasoline tanks and rubber materials next to the boiler were also engulfed in flames, and the surrounding walls and roof of the factory building immediately collapsed.  Immediately, many of the male workers on the lower floor were injured, while the female workers upstairs were instantly crushed to death by the collapsing building. Although a few managed to escape in the chaos, the fire on the lower floor was so intense that within ten minutes, the second boiler exploded again, causing a second tragedy for the workers who had already been injured, burying them all inside.  At this point, the flames raged, and the fire spread to the factory buildings as well. Fortunately, the male and female workers in those buildings had learned of the tragedy and had all escaped, so there were no casualties.</p>
<p>Rescue Efforts</p>
<p>After the accident, the factory's office staff immediately reported the fire to the Fire Brigade by telephone to request assistance. Within minutes, fire engines and ambulances from all districts of the Public Concession rushed to the scene. At the same time, the Yulin Road police station also dispatched a large team of Chinese and foreign police officers to the scene to maintain order. A large contingent of police officers were stationed at key roads in the vicinity to cut off traffic, and Chinese and foreign police officers were dispatched to the scene to assist in quickly carrying out the injured and burned male and female workers, transporting them in ambulances to various hospitals for treatment. After the firefighters made every effort to extinguish the fire for an hour, the flames gradually subsided. However, because the accident occurred so suddenly, the factory workers were unable to escape in time, so of the entire two hundred or so people, only a few dozen were able to escape. The rest were buried in the fire.</p>
<p>The Sound of Weeping Shook the Heavens</p>
<p>Before the fire engines arrived after the accident, the flames raged and the fire soared into the sky. The sound of the boiler explosions could be heard even three or four "li" (a Chinese unit of distance) away. The male and female workers who had already escaped, those who were injured and unable to walk, and those who were still trapped inside the factory being burned and exploded, cried out and screamed in unison. The sound shook the heavens, and chaos broke out immediately. Only after the fire engines and a large contingent of police officers arrived after hearing the alarm did things calm down somewhat. The scene of the tragedy: after receiving the news, the reporter immediately drove to the scene to investigate. Although the fire had been reduced, the scene of the fire was in a state of unimaginable chaos. No one could know the total number of dead and injured. According to personnel on the scene, the male and female workers in the workshop who were burned to death numbered around one hundred, and more than fifty were injured. However, given the urgency of the situation at the time, there was no time for a detailed investigation, and at this time, the fire scene had a peculiar and foul stench that was unbearable to approach. This was not only because the charred bodies emitted a burnt smell, but also because the smell of the burned rubber was extremely offensive. Piled up in the rubble were all corpses, mostly incomplete. Some were found embracing each other in death, while others had heads without feet, or eyes bulging and mouths open. Among the charred wood and scrap metal were legs and hands, with tendons exposed, a truly terrifying sight. As for the viscera strewn about and blood and flesh covering the ground, it was enough to make people sigh endlessly. Investigations revealed that most of the workers who died were female, and their entire bodies were charred beyond recognition. Only one male worker next to the boiler on the lower floor was thrown out of the wall by the force of the boiler explosion and died, and his body could still be identified. The others were too gruesome to look at. The most tragic case was that of a certain female worker who, after the disaster, not only had her flesh and blood completely blown away, but also had her bones scattered elsewhere, leaving only the bottom of a sock soaked in fresh blood.</p>
<p>Number of Fatalities</p>
<p>After the factory was extinguished, the firefighters retrieved corpses from the rubble. By 8:00 PM, the number had reached seventy-six. Their limbs were contorted and their faces were blackened. Some were missing hands and feet. The firefighters bravely carried them out and placed them in a narrow alley across from the Zhen Tai factory. At first glance, they resembled unfinished clay sculptures. Groups of family members, hoping for the return of their loved ones, all came to the scene to identify them. Those who did not find them silently prayed that they had escaped and perhaps had not yet returned. Those who had identified their loved ones wept bitterly, searching for wives and younger siblings. Such tragic scenes were common. Even those who could be identified were considered fortunate. The person who was managing the machinery downstairs was nowhere to be found because the force of the boiler explosion had shattered him into pieces.</p>

<p>Pregnant Women Among the Dead</p>
<p>Yesterday, among the corpses retrieved, there were two pregnant women. One had a ruptured abdomen and flowing intestines, with the fetus exposed, making it easier to identify. The other had the back of her head shattered by a falling piece of debris, and her brain was completely exposed. Although the court sent people to examine them to determine their identities and origins, it was impossible to tell.</p>

Female workers at Shanghai Sanatorium: 146, 185, 38. Male workers: Zhai Xianglan, Han A'fu, etc.</p>
<p>Registration</p>
<p>After the accident yesterday, the Yulin Road police station, in addition to ordering all detectives and reserve team members to assist in the rescue and security at the scene, also ordered detectives to set up a temporary office table on the side of the road opposite the factory in order to number the corpses separately when they were carried out, and to register the family members of the victims who came to report so that they could be identified in the future. In total, as of 7:00 PM, more than one hundred families had reported to the office.</p>
<p>Coffins Prepared</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, Pushan Villa dispatched Shen Zixian and Yu Ruizhang to handle all the post-disaster matters. All the injured workers were sent to major hospitals, and the deceased workers were gradually moved to the alley across from the factory. Wooden racks used to hold cloth shoes were laid down underneath. By 8:00 PM, a total of seventy-six bodies had been carried out, but there were still many that had not been moved out. Pushan Villa also transported sixty thin coffins around 6:00 PM to assist in the preparation for burial. As for the remaining fourteen bodies, three of which had been identified by their families, the remaining eleven will be prepared for burial by Pushan Villa this morning.</p>
<p>Court Examination</p>
<p>Upon receiving the report, the District Court immediately dispatched inspector Zheng Wei and four bailiffs to the scene to examine the bodies. Since most of the family members themselves had difficulty identifying them, they only pointed out the corpses and returned. They immediately issued a notice on the spot, stating that all the deceased should be identified by their family members and then reported for verification. Those who could not be identified should be temporarily stored in the Pushan Villa until further investigation. The case will be re-examined at a later date. Zheng Wei, therefore, at 6:00 PM, had Pushan Villa transport more than ten coffins to the scene on a cart to prepare for the burial of those who could not be identified.</p>
<p>Aftermath Measures</p>
<p>The Zhen Tai factory immediately issued an emergency announcement stating: All male and female workers of this factory and their family members who have experienced danger or hardship are requested to report to the registration office at No. 566, Zhen Tai Fang, Dalianwan Road, as soon as possible. This is announced. It is said that the factory authorities also held a meeting in the afternoon to discuss the aftermath. Although the incident was extraordinary, the families of the deceased will be given generous compensation, the injured will be given medical expenses, and those who have not suffered a tragic death will be transferred to the second factory to work.</p>
<h3>Song Ziwen Returned to Shanghai from Peiping Yesterday</h3>
<p>Arrived at 4:30 PM</p>
<p>Song Ziwen, Acting President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, considering the seriousness of the situation in North China, flew to Peiping on the 11th of this month on a Ford aircraft to meet with North China generals for important official business and to discuss financial measures for North China. Furthermore, due to the tense situation in Rehe and the doubled hardship of the soldiers at the front, he accompanied Zhang Xueliang and Zhang Zuoxiang to inspect and encourage the morale of the troops, further boosting their spirits. Now that the military deployment on the Rehe border has been consolidated, Mr. Song, along with Director of the National Health Administration Liu Ruiheng, Secretary Zhou Xiangxian, and Zhang Xueliang's advisor, Donald, took a Ford aircraft back south yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, arriving at Hongqiao Airport in this city at 4:30 PM in the afternoon, and then taking a car back to his residence to rest. The date of his return to Nanjing has not yet been decided.</p>
<h3>National Salvation Bonds of 20 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>Fully Pledged in Tianjin</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, regarding the financial problems in North China, Acting President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance Song Ziwen's trip north to meet with the authorities in North China has already resulted in a considerable decision. In order to cope with all military expenses in the event of an enemy invasion, it was decided to issue National Salvation Bonds of 20 million yuan, with the intention of using revenue from provincial tobacco, alcohol, and stamp taxes as collateral. Mr. Song repeatedly convened merchants from the financial circles of Peiping and Tianjin to resolve the matter. As for the sales method, according to news from banking circles in this city yesterday, the number of bonds has been confirmed at 20 million yuan. Regarding the sales method, Director Song had previously intended to bring the entire amount to Shanghai for underwriting due to the economic difficulties in North China. According to reliable sources, the banking and money circles in Tianjin have expressed their willingness to make every effort to underwrite these patriotic bonds despite the current financial difficulties. It is said that they have already pledged the 20 million yuan of bonds to Tianjin banks and money houses for a loan of 10 million yuan. Today, Japanese newspapers reported that more than 7 million yuan had been underwritten in Tianjin, and the remaining amount would be brought to Shanghai for underwriting, which is not accurate. As for the abolition of the tael and the adoption of the yuan, it has been decided that the tael and the yuan will be used together starting March 1. All ongoing matters will proceed after Mr. Song returns to both places.</p>
<p>Bystanders Affected</p>
<p>When the Zhen Tai factory accident occurred, the fire was so fierce that it affected the glass warehouse of the Lu Lin Foreign Firm on the left side of the factory and the Zhonghe Tobacco Company on the right side. Fortunately, the fire engines arrived quickly, so the losses were not great.</p>
<p>A Worker's Account</p>
<p>According to a worker who escaped from danger, he was working on the second floor of the factory where the accident occurred. There were thirteen long tables in the workshop, with twelve workers sitting at each table. Recently, the work in the factory had been unusually intense, so there were very few people on leave. When the accident occurred, he was working at his desk when a loud noise suddenly erupted, and the roof immediately collapsed. Seeing this, he knew things were bad and immediately crawled under the table to hide. At this time, many male and female workers had already been killed or seriously injured. He then intended to lie flat on the floor to avoid danger, but the floor was already on fire. So he risked everything and jumped out of the window, injuring his foot. However, compared to others, he was very fortunate. Many others died inside, and even those who were rescued suffered from burns and were in excruciating pain.</p>
<h3>Zhengtai Railway Staff Donates 100,000 Yuan to Purchase Aircraft</h3>
<p>All Circles</p>
<h3>Donations are Exceptionally Enthusiastic</h3>
<p>After the establishment of the Chinese Aviation Association, all circles have spontaneously donated large sums of money to purchase aircraft and strengthen national defense. Yesterday, the Association received a telegram from the entire staff of the Zhengtai Railway, 2,835 people, stating that they had donated 100,000 yuan to purchase the "Zhengtai" aircraft. The funds have been remitted to the National Government. The original telegram is transcribed below:</p>
<p>Telegram from Zhengtai</p>
<p>Sent to the Central Party Headquarters, National Government, Executive Yuan, Ministry of Railways, and Shanghai Aviation Association. Since the loss of the Northeast has caused pain for a year, the shame of Shanghai has not been washed away, and the disaster of Rehe has occurred again. Our colleagues on this railway, aware that national destruction is imminent, feel that there must be a way to save the nation. We have jointly made a determination, properly strategizing to seek what is beneficial to practice. Matters must be aimed at benefiting national defense, and special efforts must be devoted to the procurement of aircraft. We firmly believe that military force is the priority for defending against insults and protecting the country. This force relies not only on the army and navy. In today's world, if there is no adequate air force for use, the enemy's flames will be added and will immediately become scorched earth. Not only will jade and stone be burned together, but where will security lie? So-called having no air force is equal to having no national defense. Without national defense, we will be at the mercy of others and become fish and meat, waiting to be slaughtered. Past events prove this without a doubt. Now, the entire staff of this railway has donated a total of 100,000 yuan to purchase the "Zhengtai" aircraft. We originally knew that the amount of 100,000 yuan was very small and insufficient, but given the short length of the railway line and the small number of employees, we have tried our best to raise this amount, hoping only to slightly supplement national defense and fulfill our duty. The so-called sparrow's flight dares not aspire to the swan's back. We respectfully submit this telegram. The entire staff of the Zhengtai Railway, 2,835 people.</p>
<p>Donations from All Circles</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Chinese Aviation Association by the Mayor of this city, Wu Tiecheng, and leaders from all circles to promote aviation to save the country, donations from all circles have surged, with several donations occurring every day. The latest news received yesterday is compiled below: (1) Wang Kangshu Hua, No. 82 Wang Zhi Road, French Concession, forwarded donations for aviation to save the country, including: Wang Kangshu Hua 50 yuan, Wang Zhuo Hua 4 yuan, Wang Wanzhen 2 yuan, Yan Zhongguang 2 yuan, Zhang Jigao, Zhu Jiqing, Nie Chuanfang, Huo Shuncheng, Zhou Yizhi, Wang Juerong, Zhang Chuanfa, Zhang Chuanjun, Zhang Shouli, Wang Lanying, Wang Jueyuan, Wang Juegan, Wang Dingying, above each 1 yuan. (2) Children at No. 3 Dunren Lane, Malan Road, donated to create and purchase the "Children's Aircraft," including Wang Jia'nan 5 yuan, Wang Shunan 1 yuan, Zhang Sannan, Sinan, Wunan, Liunan, each 2 yuan.

Shen Ruoyu, Tang Zhongfan, Lin Yubin, and Jiang Kaixi, each 1 yuan from the Huafeng Enamel Factory, Zhoujiadu, Pudong. (4) Colleagues at the Shanghai Silk Industry Bank unanimously decided to first join the Aviation to Save the Country Association as members, setting an example for the city's professional circles, and paid the membership fee of 86 yuan, which was submitted to the Mayor of Shanghai for transfer. The list of names is as follows: Wang Yansong, Xu Kuanglu, Xu Ganqing, He Jinyun, Xu Yizhi, Shen Shanyu, Tian Xiangru, Yue Xiuliang, Zhang Guanhai, Shi Guantao, Shen Qingheng, Lu Yongnian, Liu Zhan'an, Chen Yunshen, Mao Shouwei, Luo Xintan, Cheng Bingjun, Zhu Yinong, Luo Qinghua, Chen Rufa, Zhang Lishen, Pan Zhenhua, Xu Huakang, Chen Jingxuan, Tian Leping, Wang Weinong, Zhong Zimin, Chen Deshan, Liu Xunwu, Fan Yingzhou, Zeng Jingfu, Huang Ganxun, Hu Rihua, Li Jingmen, Ji Jimin, Ju Fujiang, Wang Chunzhou, Wang Ruikang, Wu Chengxiang, Chu Tingjue, Xuan Junhuan, Hu Shiqiu, Hu Renyu.

<p>Yu Hongjun and Feixin Dun Discuss Two Cases</p>
<p>Water Suspension and Factory Inspection</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Municipal Secretary-General Yu Hongjun invited Public Concession Director-General Feixin Dun to lunch yesterday to exchange views on the water supply issue in the Concession and factory inspections. According to Secretary-General Yu, regarding the water price increase issue, the Municipal Government considers the supply of drinking water to be very important to the lives of citizens, so it has decided to order the Public Utilities Bureau to negotiate with the water company to seek a proper solution. Feixin Dun also agreed to urge the company not to resort to water suspension before the matter is resolved, and to find ways to restore water to those who have already been suspended, so as to facilitate the resolution of the issue. As for the factory inspection issue, the Concession side's opinion will be submitted in writing. It is subtly heard that the Concession authorities intend to handle it themselves, but our side will not agree due to sovereignty issues.</p>
<p>News of Water Suspension Yesterday</p>
<p>The following is a record of news after the water company suspended water supply:</p>
<h3>Mediation Without Result</h3>
<p>Mediator Mr. Feng Bingnan, the day before yesterday afternoon, with company representative Pi Yaxun and representatives from the Real Estate Association, Que Yanfang and Dou Yaoting, held a long discussion at the Lianhua General Assembly. Although a water supply solution was proposed, both sides' representatives still needed to consider it in detail, so it ended without results. It is likely that continued negotiations will be possible within the week, but the date has not yet been determined.</p>
<h3>Water Suspension Continued Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Real Estate Association received a letter from member Gu Lanji Accounting Firm yesterday, which stated: "To whom it may concern, our 17 buildings from No. 340 to No. 356 Dalianwan Road have been suspended from paying water fees due to disputes. Recently, we received a letter from the Sixth Company, requesting payment of water fees by the 20th of this month, and stating that if payment is not made, the water will be cut off. Our firm immediately calculated the water price according to the usual water supply system, totaling 105 yuan and 27 cents (fees for July, August, and September), and sent it to the water company, but it was refused. On the 15th of this month, we prepared a letter along with the water fees and sent it via registered mail, but the company refused to accept it and returned it. This morning, the water pipes for the above-mentioned buildings were suddenly completely cut off, suspending the water supply. This is obviously detrimental to the drinking water of residents. We are forwarding this letter to you and hope that you will consider the matter."</p>
<h3>Real Estate Association Announcement</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Real Estate Association issued a notice yesterday, addressed to its members and property owners and rental agents who have not yet joined the association, which stated: "To whom it may concern, our real estate industry is now in a squeeze and has no way out. If we do not unite and stand on the same front to jointly resist the water company's murderous tactics of cutting off water and demanding money, and instead allow them to defeat us individually, then even the fox will not have time to mourn the rabbit. Among our real estate industry, there may be those who do not understand the truth, thinking that the water fees calculated using meters are less than before, so we don't need to fight. Our properties may not have water meters installed yet, so the future water fees, whether high or low, are not yet known, so we can temporarily not fight. We see that others are already fighting, and if they win, we will also enjoy the benefits, so why should we join the fight and remain neutral observers? I believe that these few colleagues who do not understand the truth are only seeking temporary peace and will eventually feel the pain and perish together. This is still speaking from the perspective of the landlord. As for landlords who cannot bear the huge burden, they will inevitably resort to resistance. If the resistance does not achieve satisfactory results, they will inevitably face water suspension. Now, the water company is using force, accompanied by Chinese and foreign police officers, to dismantle water pipes in more than twenty places, with hundreds of households in each place. With eight people per household, the ones who directly feel the pain are the more than 20,000 tenants. The tenants certainly do not want the landlords to bear an excessive burden, and the landlords do not want the tenants to be in danger of life. Therefore, landlords and tenants should unite and stand on the same front to jointly resist the water company's murderous tactics of cutting off water and demanding money, otherwise, even licking chaff will not be enough to escape the rice pot. Now, a large number of colleagues have joined with tenants, in the capacity of citizens, to fight for the benefit of all citizens, willing to endure the pain of food and drink deprivation and to fight with the water company with their lives and property. Since the water company sees itself as the cleaver, can the landlords and tenants willingly be fish and meat? Therefore, at the general meeting on February 17, it was unanimously decided that [before the water company resumes water supply and sincerely seeks a legal and reasonable solution, all water fees will be temporarily withheld and not paid]. In addition to the emergency announcements already made in various newspapers, all our colleagues, whether members or not, and all tenants, whether they have been affected or not, must help themselves and each other and share the same boat, otherwise, it will be too late for regret. We hereby inform you and hope you will understand." (Guowenshe)</p>

<p>Acknowledgement We received the 30th volume, 4th issue of "Children's World" and the 20th issue of "English Weekly" from The Commercial Press yesterday, and the 787th issue of "Banking Weekly" from the Banking Weekly Press. We hereby express our gratitude.</p>
<p>Letters to the Editor</p>
<p>To the Esteemed Editor,</p>
<p>Having read the news in today's paper about the grain merchants in Southern Shanghai declaring a strike, the statement that the "secret loss of each 'hu' of rice is one 'sheng'" is completely inaccurate. According to the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Weights and Measures, the 'hu' master uses a standard 'hu' to measure 'hu' of rice, with a 'shi' (stone) having a secret loss of four 'sheng'. This is based on the public verification of the flat 'hu' standard at the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Weights and Measures on October 30th of last year. We respectfully request that your newspaper correct this to clarify the suffering endured by the boatmen. Respectfully, the Lianyi Association of Rice Merchants in Southern Shanghai, February 20th.</p>
<p>To Whom It May Concern,</p>
<p>Having read the news item in the local news section of your newspaper on the 21st of this month concerning the limited-time automatic telephone service in Shanghai, much of the content is inaccurate. Furthermore, Director Yu, the engineer of our bureau, did not speak with any reporters that day. The claim that "according to the chief engineer of the bureau yesterday" is completely fabricated. Such reporting is likely to cause misunderstandings. We hereby send this letter specifically to request verification and correction. Respectfully, the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, February 22nd.</p>
<p>Submission</p>
<p>To Jingluan from Jingchun, Who Left Without Saying Goodbye</p>
<p>Sister Jingluan:</p>
<p>Reading the letter you left me has broken my heart! Tears of blood streamed across the page. When I returned home, our parents were unrecognizable. Father was grief-stricken, almost mad! Running up and down the stairs, one moment shouting and raging, the next talking to himself. Mother cries all day long, and her illness has returned. The two elders are neglecting their food and sleep, their energy depleted, still foolishly listening for the sound of the door, hoping for your return. At the sound of leather shoes, they look around, thinking it's you, only to burst into tears again in disappointment. You didn't take any of your clothes with you. Mother weeps, worried you'll catch a cold, not knowing where you are now or what suffering you're enduring. My poor sister! Are you suffering? Are you homesick and grieving? You said you were going out to study, but can a weak woman not be deceived? Even if you succeed in your studies and find success, will our ailing parents still be alive? Alas! If something happens to our elders, your younger siblings won't be able to survive! Sister! Can you bear to sacrifice the lives of so many for your own pursuit of a better life? The younger siblings cry all day long, their young hearts broken because of you! Now, we only hope for a letter from you saying you're safe, which will lessen the pain of our elders and calm their hearts. One letter from you can save so many lives. Please write back quickly, sister! Have some compassion, take pity on us! Our family, apart from the slight constraints typical of old-fashioned large families, has all sorts of family happiness: family reunions, conversations around the stove, and so on. You'll realize outside that you can't find this kind of happiness anywhere else. If you already feel this way, come home quickly. Mother and father will definitely not punish you for your foolish mistake. Your younger siblings will definitely not laugh at you. It wasn't easy for our parents to raise you to this age. In the past, when you were sick, father and mother always cared for you with extra love. Your health has never been good. Can you withstand the hardships outside? If you get sick, who will take care of you? Think of our deceased third sister, she must also be weeping and pitying you from the underworld. She loved you most in her life. Now seeing you wandering outside, can she not shed tears in the afterlife? You know that those who don't like you are laughing and mocking you every day, making mother's heart ache even more. Why do you have to break the hearts of those who love you and let those who don't love you laugh in secret? I beg you tearfully to write a letter stating the reason you left home so that mother and your younger siblings can be at peace. Don't you miss our parents and younger siblings? Are you willing for our family to cry all day and all night, unable to sit or sleep peacefully? Our parents may now allow you to study or work outside freely and will definitely not force you to return. Because you are often sick, we hope for a letter to know that you're safe. We are truly, with utmost sincerity, praying with tears for good news from you. Oh, sister! I vow that if you can return, I will write sutras with my blood and hang them before the gods. The things you usually say to me are very clear. You also know that our parents are the most loving. We sisters are our parents' second life. Your sudden departure is akin to ending our parents' lives! Sister! Think about it carefully from the beginning, and come back. Don't stubbornly resist to the end. You must know that your motive, although not a bad one, is fundamentally wrong. Don't be deluded. A wandering, homeless person, writing poems and lyrics on the temple walls, using some fictional, sorrowful words, seems moving and touching, but if you were actually in that situation, it would be very bitter. Sister! Don't fantasize. Every word I write is written with tears and blood. I think you will be moved when you read it. Sister! My heart is broken. I, clumsy and ineloquent, have no words to express our sorrow. I am truly calling to heaven without response. Sister! I only hope you can see this letter. Wishing you peace, Your younger sister, Jingchun, weeping Reader's Consultant</p>
<p>The Issue of Religious Freedom</p>
<p>| Mr. Gan Lai's Submission |</p>
<p>In the Reader's Consultant section of your newspaper on the 13th of this month, there was a letter responding to Ms. Jiang Xin, in which she expressed dissatisfaction with religion, and especially with Buddhism. As a Buddhist myself, I cannot help but offer an explanation. I believe that all people are equal, and freedom of religious belief is already enshrined in the constitution. Furthermore, there are specific articles punishing those who openly insult temples and monasteries, as the teachings of all religions aim to encourage good and reform evil, and to clarify the mind and restore one's nature, thus supplementing the inadequacies of law and politics. Therefore, governments in various countries in the East are doing their utmost to protect all religions, and some have even stipulated that Buddhism is the state religion, their intentions are truly profound. Buddhism entered China during the reign of Emperor Ming of the Han Dynasty and has been here for over two thousand years. Many eminent monks have emerged, revered by the heavens and recorded in history, which can be verified. Its teachings are based on upholding the five precepts of abstaining from killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, lying, and intoxication, with the principle of sacrificing oneself to save the world. Non-killing is benevolence, non-stealing is righteousness, non-sexual misconduct is propriety, non-lying is trustworthiness, and non-drinking is wisdom, which aligns with the five constants of Confucianism. In the past, Emperor Wen of the Song Dynasty said to Keshang, "If all the people within the borders could be influenced by Buddhism, we could achieve peace simply by sitting still. In a village of a hundred families, if ten people observe the five precepts, then those ten people will be honest and cautious. In a town of a thousand households, if a hundred people observe the five precepts, then those hundred people will be harmonious. If this is used to influence education throughout the world, with hundreds of millions of households, then there will be millions of benevolent people. Moreover, if a person can perform one good deed, then they will remove one evil. If one evil is removed, then one punishment will cease. If one punishment ceases in the family, then ten thousand punishments will cease in the country. What worry is there that the world will not be governed?" Yet, this effect still refers to upholding the precepts. As for the Mahayana Bodhisattvas, they seek enlightenment above to benefit themselves and transform sentient beings below to benefit others. They have great roots, possess great wisdom, believe in great teachings, grasp great principles, cultivate great practices, and seek great results. They can do what is difficult to do, give up what is difficult to give up, and endure what is difficult to endure. Embracing the principle of benefiting others before benefiting oneself, they actively save the world, which is far beyond what petty Hinayana Buddhists who are averse to the world, are negative, and only seek to benefit themselves can compare to. However, as we have come down to modern times, the number of believers has increased, and there are some who do not adhere to the precepts. Yet, we cannot condemn the entire group because of the actions of one or two individuals, just as we cannot blame Confucius' teachings because his son was unworthy. Recently, the National Government has issued an order to the entire country, stating that all religions should be treated with due respect, with profound intentions. Your newspaper is responsible for guiding public opinion and leading the masses. I hope you will pay attention to this.</p>
<p>Reply: Your letter is filled with earnest teachings, correcting many points in this column's response to Ms. Jiang Xin's letter, showing your deep concern for this column. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! All letters in this column are answered by experts hired separately. Regarding the questions raised in Ms. Jiang Xin's letter, the respondent expressed their personal doubts about religion, hence their statement. In fact, religious belief is entirely for personal benefit, and the influence of Buddhism on society, as described in your letter, is indeed very great. It is not permissible to deny everything based on the opinion of one person, nor can anyone deny its inherent value. We respectfully acknowledge the intent of your teachings and disclose your letter to allow readers to compare and refer to it, and to make corrections. The discussion of this issue will also come to an end.</p>
<p>Notice: Readers submitting letters must fulfill the procedures specified by this column: (1) Clearly state your name, age, gender, native place, address, and occupation; (2) Attach sufficient return postage; (3) Affix the communication stamp for this column: This has already been declared in this column before. However, many readers' letters recently still do not follow the above procedures, especially failing to provide a clear mailing address and sufficient return postage. It feels like a betrayal of their sincerity to set them aside without replying, and it is practically difficult to make exceptions. We hereby solemnly declare again: From now on, please follow the specified procedures when submitting letters, otherwise, we regret that we will not be able to reply. Previous letters that did not meet the requirements will still be answered separately if the corrections are not received within one week. This notice.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Education Orders the Formation of a Committee to Compile</p>
<p>Specific Elementary School Curricula</p>
<p>Designates Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hebei, Shandong, Hunan, Guangdong, and Shanghai to Proceed First</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education issued a circular to all departments and bureaus, stating in brief: The Ministry previously promulgated the kindergarten and elementary school curriculum standards, which only listed outlines. Specific curricula, such as teaching materials and examples of teaching practices, etc., except for most of the Chinese language, arithmetic, and social studies subjects, and part of the natural science subject, for which there are nationally recognized textbooks approved by the Ministry that can be used as a basis, for which provinces and cities shall order separately, the rest, which have local and temporal characteristics and for which there are no textbooks, should be specifically compiled and ordered annually, according to the seasons and local conditions. In order to prepare examples of the implementation of the specific curriculum, for the reference of various provinces and cities in compiling, in accordance with the fourth item of the implementation methods of the curriculum standards, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hebei, Shandong, Hunan, Guangdong, and Shanghai educational departments and bureaus are designated to proceed first. The implementation methods of the kindergarten and elementary school curriculum standards are enclosed.

<p>The Chinese Education Society Requests the Ministry of Education to</p>
<p>Consider Flexible Curriculum Standards</p>
<p>Referring to Schools with an Experimental Nature</p>
<p>The standing directors of the Chinese Education Society, Chang Daozhi, Zheng Zonghai, Zheng Tonghe, Chen 　jiang, and Xu Benhuan, for the sake of experimenting with and improving education, specially requested the Ministry of Education to consider flexible promulgation of elementary and secondary school curriculum standards. The original submission is as follows: We believe that the improvement of education depends on educational experiments. Therefore, schools with an experimental nature, for the sake of experimenting with educational theories, cannot be treated the same as ordinary schools. The curriculum standards for elementary and secondary schools have been stipulated and promulgated by your Ministry. All schools should follow them uniformly. However, for the sake of experimenting with and improving education, we propose that your Ministry stipulate that schools with an experimental nature may flexibly adjust them and include them in the elementary and secondary school regulations, so that schools with an experimental nature can flexibly adjust them in the future to conduct experiments and seek improvement. We respectfully submit this to the Minister of Education, Zhu, for your consideration and approval. Elementary School Citizenship Training Standards (1)</p>

<p>Private Schools in the French Concession</p>
<p>Will Continue to Promote the Subsidy Movement</p>
<p>The Joint Association of Private Primary and Secondary Schools in the French Concession of this city, last year launched a movement to demand that the French Municipal Council implement subsidies for private schools within the concession starting this year. After dissuasion by the city government and the city education bureau, and direct negotiations with the French consul, the work was immediately suspended. After a long time with no news, the association was quite disappointed. According to Mr. Hong, the current committee member of the association, he told reporters yesterday that the work was suspended because the schools were on vacation and the responsible persons had returned to their hometowns. Now that the schools have started, they will continue to discuss and promote the subsidy movement in the coming days.</p>

<p>This Friday's Women's Basketball Game</p>
<p>Liangjiang vs. West League</p>
<p>▲ 8:15 PM at the YMCA</p>
<p>The Xijiang Women's Basketball Team played against the Jiangguo Women's Team at the YMCA last week. Because the team's star player Chen Rongming was fouled out midway, the team lost its offensive and defensive focus, resulting in a slight setback.

<p>West Qing Retains Shanghai Basketball A-Group Championship</p>
<p>Defeats Hujiang Again丨42 to 38丨Difference of 4 Points</p>
<p>West Qing's Solid Defense Limits Hujiang's Opportunities</p>
<p>The West Qing Basketball Team defeated Hujiang again last night with a score of 42 to 38, winning the Shanghai Basketball Association A-Group Championship and retaining the title. Although the situation of this battle was more intense than the first time, Hujiang still followed behind and never surpassed. This was because the opponent's defense was too tight, limiting Hujiang's forwards' opportunities to penetrate and score. Relying entirely on sudden attacks was difficult. Judging from the situation of these two finals, it is feared that China will still have no hope of winning back the championship in this year's World Basketball Championship. It is hoped that all our athletes will work hard.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the first half, West Qing's guard Bai Naite rushed out to shoot, but missed. Qi Er also missed successively.</p>
<p>Hujiang was anxious and also failed to score. Bai Naite fouled, and Jing Rong made one of two free throws, opening the scoring. Smith scored two consecutive goals, winning 4 to 1. Feng Nianhua and Qian Suyong also scored one goal each, and Hujiang surpassed by one point. But from then on, Hujiang was at a disadvantage and did not show its strength. Smith added five more points, and Qi Er scored continuously. The score became 13 to 8. West Qing once won 18 to 8. Hujiang worked hard to catch up, and Lu Zhongen and Sun Baoqing added six points. At the end of the first half, West Qing had 18 points and Hujiang had 14 points.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the second half, Lu Zhongen made a wonderful long-range shot, and the audience applauded loudly. But in the blink of an eye, West Qing's Bai Naite, Smith, and Pilai scored three consecutive goals, winning 24 to 16. After a short period of stalemate, Hujiang's luck turned. Feng Nianhua added a goal, Sun Baoqing returned a goal, and Wu Guolin made two successful long-range shots, and the score suddenly became 24 to 24, eliciting enthusiastic applause. Seeing that the situation was not good, West Qing recalled Qi Er, who had already been substituted, to replace Touren, and the military appearance was restored. Qi Er scored a goal immediately, and Sun Baoqing tied the score again (26 to 26). Later, due to the continuous scoring of Smith and Bai Naite, Hujiang failed to catch up. From then on, it was always behind and could hardly make efforts to attack, only maintaining a situation of not being too far behind until the end. Hujiang still lost by a difference of four points. West Qing won with a score of 42 to 38. The referees were Shu Hong and Li Zuqi.</p>

<h3>Beating the Winner</h3>
<p>— Lan</p>
<p>“Won! Won!” It was a groom shouting there.</p>
<p>A groom's steed was stolen by a horse thief. The groom was not reconciled and shouted his grievance before the Mr. Justice. Once, to no avail, twice, to no avail, until the last time, he obtained a public judgment from Mr. Justice, proving that this steed truly was something raised by the groom. Apart from proving this, there could be no further assistance. However, the groom was already shouting, “Won!”, this is called losing a steed, winning a word.</p>
<p>“Won! Won!” It was a chess player shouting there.</p>
<p>The chess player was playing chess with someone. That person was clumsy. Taking advantage of the time when the chess player was striking a match to light a cigarette, he unexpectedly captured a large piece of the chess player's live pieces on the northeast corner. The chess player was not reconciled and asked Mr. Justice for a public judgment. Mr. Justice spent many methods, finally proving that this piece of live chess was indeed stolen by someone. After it had already been proven, Mr. Justice thought it was impossible to restore the original state of the chessboard. However, the chess player was already shouting, “Won!”, this is called losing a corner of the chessboard, winning an empty name.</p>
<p>“Won! Won!” It was a restaurant owner shouting there.</p>
<p>A restaurant owner's braised pork hock was snatched by a passing beggar and chewed on at his mouth. The owner argued with the beggar, but the beggar said, “This hock walked into my hand step by step.” The owner shouted to the people, “Can there be a braised pork hock that knows how to walk?” The people who heard this did not come to pay attention. Finally, a Mr. Justice proved that this hock certainly did not walk to the beggar's side by itself. If he wanted to snatch back this hock that had been chewed, it would depend on the owner's ability. However, the owner was already shouting, “Won! Won!”, this is called losing a hock, winning some face.</p>
<p>In the above three matters, what was lost was real, and what was won was empty. However, the bullies who received the public judgment did not dare to stubbornly resist Mr. Justice, but came looking for these nominal winners. They clenched their fists, rubbed their palms, and shouted with a surging momentum, “Beat the winner! Beat the winner!”</p>

<p>New York, February 20th Telegram: Today, the National Gold Exchange's forward silver price experienced broad fluctuations and huge transactions. The reason was that speculators felt that the House Appropriations Committee's proposed increase in silver usage, setting silver coins to issue silver subsidiary coin vouchers, had a chance of being established after the review committee's results. Furthermore, the development of the Sino-Japanese issue was a reason for silver to increase, causing the forward silver to rise sharply, reaching as high as one and a half points. The closing price could also net a profit of 62 to 98 pounds, and the transaction volume of 8.75 million taels was also the largest record since the exchange existed. It is now learned that the review committee will report this case to the Appropriations Committee in the middle of this week. Based on the opinions of some powerful parties, this resolution seems to have the possibility of passing in the House.</p>
<p>"Li Chai" (Interest Rates) Both See New High Prices</p>
<p>The Market is Stagnant, but the Situation is Favorable Yesterday, the market conditions for both foreign silver and silver coins were still not very prosperous. However, due to competitive relationships, the interest rate did rise again, finding a new high price. The silver swap rate has been borrowed every day since the financial sector opened at the beginning of the year. It was as if it were a stereotype, and we had never seen any slight market conditions. Yesterday, there were actually several points of market conditions. Therefore, although trading in the market was stagnant, the situation was relatively better. The Jiangxi and Guangdong small coins both fell, while copper coins continued to increase, exceeding the range of 20,000.</p>
<p>Interest Rates Rise Suddenly, and Swap Rates Have Three Points [Foreign Interest] The interest rate in the early market seemed to be 1 hao and 2 hu and a half smaller than the previous day, at 7 qian, 1 fen, and 5 li. The interest rate suddenly rose by half a li in the afternoon market, to 7 qian, 1 fen, and 5 li and a half, the highest price seen since the beginning of this year. [Silver Swap Rate] The early and afternoon markets yesterday began to have a 3-point market condition. Although the silver supply was not tight, it should be known that there was a bank market for the first time yesterday. The initial discount rate was 6-7 fen, and the final closing was 4-5 fen.</p>
<p>Small Coins All Fall, Copper Coins Wary Yesterday, Jiangnan small coins fell by a small 3 li and a half due to not much trading, and the situation was slack, to 6 qian and 05 li. Trading was 6,000 jiao in the early market and 4,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Guangdong small coins were too expensive at the previous day's market price, so yesterday they fell again by a small amount. The early market was 5 qian and 9 fen, and the afternoon market was 5 qian, 8 fen, and 8 li and a half. As a result, it was about 4 li less than the previous day's early market. Trading was 102,000 jiao in the early market and 45,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins increased by another 1,500 wen, exceeding the 110,000 threshold, to 420,500 wen. Transactions were also made for 52,562,500 wen, equivalent to 12,500 taels of silver.</p>
<p>Foreign Silver Collection and Delivery is Moderately Busy: Yesterday's market conditions were moderately busy. Foreign firms collected and delivered approximately 1,670,000 in bills, Chinese firms collected and delivered approximately 2,000,000 in bills, advanced payments of over 2,000,000, and there were no incoming or outgoing telegraphic transfers. Special collection and delivery was 2,560,000, pawn transactions were over 1,100,000, and various goods, exchange taxes, and other collections and deliveries totaled over 9,100,000. The outflow was 800,000. Money shops and silver companies collected and delivered over 27,000,000, discounted collections and deliveries were over 4,600,000, collections and deliveries from various routes were over 10,000, and cash collection was 560,000.</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange with Banks is Quite Quiet: Foreign currency transactions, the market's interbank exchange and bill transactions were 750,000 in the early market and 855,000 in the afternoon. Banknotes were 55,000 in the early market and 20,000 in the afternoon. Outside of the market, banknotes were 75,000 in the early market and 60,000 in the afternoon. Checks were 35,000 in the early market and 25,000 in the afternoon. Because transactions were not smooth, the banks sat idly by in the market and did not care, so the situation was quite quiet. Interbank trade was 100,000 in the early market and 800,000 in the afternoon. Foreign account collections and deliveries among various banks were over 1,800,000, foreign pawn transactions were over 500,000, and borrowing and lending of foreign currencies totaled over 1,500,000. Banknote collection and issuance was over 1,780,000. Money shops' foreign public bill collections and deliveries were over 5,400,000, and foreign discount collections and deliveries were over 1,200,000. Transactions of small money shops were over 500,000. Apart from 200,000 from the inland area, there were no foreign sources or destinations.</p>
<p>Securities</p>
<p>The Public Debt Market in the Storm</p>
<p>Yesterday, the public debt market on the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange still felt unstable. Most of the bulls and bears of this month's famous gangs had to either settle or swap their positions at this time, due to the inability of the bulls to receive goods and the inability of the bears to deliver goods. Therefore, the market price in January was relatively stable. As for the three-month period, the surge in selling failed to rise. In terms of the diplomatic situation, Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations has been decided, and the outbreak of the Rehe War is difficult to avoid. The relationship between the scope of future wars and our abdomen is of great concern to the public. The precarious situation is the best opportunity for speculators, and also the most difficult time. Therefore, the market price still has a volatile appearance. In the first round of the morning, the retail bulls had a lot of , with prices in small decimals. However, with the claim that Jinzhou had been recovered, Northern gangs such as numbers 14 and 34 made up for short positions. Therefore, the various subsequent listings did not fall but instead rose by three to five jiao. In the second round, the reorganization slightly rose by two jiao, and troop reductions were also relatively stable. Afterwards, due to rumors that military affairs in Rehe had already made contact, people's hearts suddenly became empty, and the Northern gangs sold again, causing the market price to uniformly retreat. The difference between the far-term and current-month salt tax was as much as one yuan and four jiao and five fen, causing the bulls to swap positions in the afternoon. The current month was down one jiao, and the far month was flat. The rest were also quite chaotic due to swap relations, and prices rose there and fell here. For example, troop reductions fell by six to seven jiao, while 20-roll bond rose by one jiao and five fen. Due to swap positions of 19 Customs and 19 Good Bonds by bulls, the near was small and the far was large. This is also a distorted phenomenon that easily occurs near delivery. At closing, the bulls swapped positions even more urgently, and the market price became more special. For example, number 47 of the current-month troop reductions was frantically sold, plunging by one yuan, while the far term rose by one jiao. The current-month reorganization was down by a small three jiao, while the far term rose by five jiao. These are all unique phenomena near delivery. Due to the news of the Rehe fire and Japan's setbacks, the market prices of everything except reorganization and troop reductions rose by two to three jiao. As a result, the market prices fell more and rose less. Troop reductions fell sharply by one yuan to two and a half yuan, the most significant. The current-month 19 Customs fell by one yuan and a little over two to three jiao to six to seven jiao. However, the unified salt tax rose by three to four jiao. The total transaction volume was 10.38 million yuan, including 5,000 yuan in spot goods. Futures salt tax accounted for 2.41 million, troop reductions accounted for over 1.8 million, unified tax accounted for 1.34 million, and 19 Customs also accounted for over 1.4 million. The rest were all less than 1 million. 18 Customs was only 35,000. Transactions were mostly for the three-month period, and the two-month period accounted for about one-third.</p>
<p>Yarn and Cotton</p>
<p>The Downward Trend of Standard Yarn and Cotton is Gradually Intensifying</p>
<p>Cheap Printed Cotton Traded at 20,000 Pieces▲</p>
<p>The yarn market is still sluggish, because the actual need still takes time, and the situation is becoming more and more serious, making people feel depressed. However, a portion, due to its small base, has not extinguished the concept of going long. Therefore, when the market declines, those who profit replenish, and the market sees a rebound. In short, the financial situation is very tight, and inventories are too thick, so the rising trend is being contained.</p>
<p>The Near-Term Yarn Continues to Fall by One or Two Personal Standard Before the Market Opened: Gold prices plummeted, and the market was compared, with prices falling by five, seven, eight, and nine qian in each month. In the afternoon, it was heard that there was an actual need for 600 bales, and there were rumors that yarn factories had stopped night work. At closing, there was a slight rebound, with the near month falling by two and five qian, and the far month rising by three and five qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 36,800 bales. It was found that the sellers were Tong Ji at 1,250 bales, Tai Sheng Kang at 1,300 bales, Ren Feng at 900 bales, Da Chang Jiu at 1,150 bales, Ji Feng at 850 bales, and Tai Chang at 700 bales. The buyers were Yi Chang at 2,950 bales, Ming De at 750 bales, Yuan Da at 950 bales, Yong Chang at 700 bales, Heng Chang at 850 bales, Sui Long at 650 bales, and Shen Chang at 600 bales.

<p>Spot Yarn Sales are Average It was found that the total purchase by each gang yesterday was 626 bales, with prices falling by two and a half to five qian. The purchase amount for each gang is as follows:</p>
<p>Inland 231 Datong 5 Luzhou 22 Peers 42 Wuhu 5 Yunnan 80 Zhenjiang 10 Ningbo 1 Sichuan 230</p>
<p>The Downward Trend of the Cotton Market is Gradually Rising: Due to the falling gold market, the exchange rate increasing, the calculation of foreign cotton prices being particularly low, and the low-priced printed cotton, a large number of 20,000 pieces opened, panic suddenly arose in people's hearts. There was also a certain cotton industry organization that massively sold short due to the stagnation of spot cotton business, so the market was particularly difficult to stabilize. However, most of the bulls still held on tightly. The bears for this month were well-prepared, and the threshold of 30 taels may be difficult to maintain.</p>
<p>Near-Term Cotton Falls Again by Five Qian: Before the Zheng Standard Market Opened: Gold prices plummeted, and the selling sentiment in the market was strong. Prices for each month fell by three and four qian. In the afternoon, 20,000 pieces of printed cotton opened, causing great fatigue in people's hearts, and each month fell by another one and two qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 101,000 dan. It was found that the sellers were Ji Feng at 7,400 dan, Heng Yi at 3,900 dan, Sui Jiang at 9,300 dan, Yi Feng at 2,400 dan, Yu Da at 1,500 dan, Chang Feng at 1,700 dan, Yuan Da at 1,100 dan, and Da Fu at 1,100 dan. The buyers were Yu Kang at 2,000 dan, Geng Feng at 2,800 dan, Chang Feng at 2,200 dan, Yuan Ren at 3,200 dan, Tai Chang at 2,100 dan, Tong He at 2,000 dan, Heng Chang at 2,100 dan, Tong Fu at 1,000 dan, and Tong Xing at 1,400 dan. The closing prices are as follows:</p>

The need for spot cotton by local cotton factories is blocked, but there is a large amount of opening of printed cotton with cheap prices. Foreign cotton also has the potential to dominate, making it difficult for Chinese cotton to maintain its position. The source is estimated to be Yao cotton at 950 bales.</p>
<p>Printed Cotton Du Li Pulls at 30.75: Shen Xin Factory Imports 5,000 Pieces of Spot Goods, Continued Delivery to Factories: Kang Di Salt at 29.50, Also 7,000 Pieces, Also Rangoon Cotton at 30.00, Also 2,500 Pieces, Also Bai Luo Qu at 31.00, Wei Tong Factory Imports 200 Pieces of Spot Goods, Delivered to Factories: Xing Heng Cotton at 32.00, Also 300 Pieces, Also Peng Jia Pu at 30.00, Heng Feng Factory Imports 500 Pieces, Also Tianjin American Cotton at 33.00, Li Tai Factory Imports 140 Pieces of Spot Goods, Delivered to Warehouse, Also 32.75, Also 240 Pieces, Also</p>
<p>Overseas Cotton Market has Slight Discrepancies</p>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton was firm at first due to political news favorable to bulls and good news from Liverpool, but then turned weak, with futures rising and falling by one to three pounds. Spot goods were unchanged. British cotton futures rose by six to seven points, and spot goods rose by eleven points. Egyptian cotton spot goods rose by eighteen points. Indian cotton trading was suspended. The original telegram is recorded on the left (20th telegram).</p>

<p>Supplies Interrupted in Inland Areas, Thin Rice Rises by Two Jiao</p>
<p>Due to the obstruction of rice boats from the Minhang and Huangdu areas in southern Shanghai, no rice boats from the southern gangs arrived in Shanghai. Only a few boats from the northern port arrived. City and township stores were sluggish, and few guests visited. Only three to four hundred shi of contracted rice was handled. Fortunately, the market was stable due to the rice boat gangs' dispute over unloading and funnels, which were all blocked in the Minhang and Huangdu areas. As a result, the prices of goods accumulated by the Tongli and Nan Port gangs stabilized. Thin rice lacked supply and was priced two jiao higher. Dujian market had no honor or disgrace. Western tip rice was sluggish and priced a small jiao. Chang Gang and have been阴元定局而已 is already is already Shanghai North 昨日河下各帮來船十六七號 The situation is that the ships of all gangs came from the rivers yesterday, number sixteen or seventeen The white japonica rice has an early road, the market is still acceptable, and the guests still want to shout tight, resulting in a clear solution for the stomach, and the market is set to格 is already The thin japonica rice and early japonica arrive and sell in both patterns The arrival of Yang Du and Bujian is not prosperous, the stomach is normal, the price is tired, and the客尖 follows, 阴元Lack of arrival,白元 is still tired.</p>

<h3>Two Sexes</h3>
<p>— Sichen</p>
<p>丨On Various Things Between Men and Women丨</p>
<p>Two sexes refer to men and women. Social improvement and progress depend entirely on the cooperation and creation of both sexes. Therefore, we usually don't talk about this colorful world, but when we do, we inevitably have to mention the four words [men and women].</p>
<p>In the past, in ancient China, there was always a custom of [valuing men and belittling women]. That was an era of a completely male-centered society. However, there were exceptions. For example, in the "Song of Everlasting Regret," there is the line [not valuing boys but valuing girls], and in the "Ballad of the War Chariots," it is also mentioned [knowing that giving birth to boys is evil, it is better to give birth to girls]. Let's not worry about that for now. Because [Heaven gives birth to men and women] so that they can live together in harmony for a hundred years, there is no need to fuss about [valuing men and belittling women] or [valuing women and belittling men]. There is an old saying that [when a boy grows up, he should marry, and when a girl grows up, she should be married]. This so-called [growing up] originally had a standard. You see [a man marries at thirty, and a woman marries at twenty], isn't that what it means? However, in recent times, the mutual union of men and women is generally based on the maturity of their love for each other, and people probably don't pay much attention to age limits.</p>
<p>[Men are made of mud, and women are made of water], so using the phrase [desiring to melt with water] to describe a man meeting a woman is most appropriate.</p>
<p>[Men are in charge of external affairs, and women are in charge of internal affairs] is an ancient and clear teaching, but now some people are still shouting about raising women's rights under the topic of [equal rights for men and women]. As a result, women's careers have been promoted at this time. However, we must consider that if there really comes a day when men and women are both in charge of external affairs, then who will be in charge of internal affairs? Isn't this a very perplexing problem?</p>
<p>[Food, drink, men, and women are the great desires of humans], this is correct. As for the phrases [men and women are different] and [men and women should not touch hands when giving and receiving things], these two phrases should be abolished from the text because, apart from physiological differences, it has long been proven in various aspects that [men and women are not different]. Moreover, now that social interaction is open and love is free, the so-called [men and women should not touch hands when giving and receiving things] has long been a mere formality.</p>
<p>Having said all that, finally, I hope that all the [red men and green women] will not engage in [men dressing as women] or [women dressing as men] to the extent that they become [men who don't look like men, and women who don't look like women]. They should adhere to the original intention of [men and women acting together] and jointly create an amazing masterpiece.</p>
<h3>Resurrection of Shark Fin</h3>
<p>— Longsao</p>
<p>Under the bright lights, everyone's face was red. The smell of alcohol filled the large dining room. The surrounding waves of conversation were as dense as fog, but soon, the Ningbo waiters quickly served such a large bowl of shark fin soup, with hot steam rising intensely. Then the host came to propose a toast. Then, chopsticks rained down, and finally, the bottom of the bowl faced the sky, causing my heart to jump involuntarily. I was watching with my arms folded. It's not necessarily that I am an absolute patriot, but I feel that since the loss of the three northeastern provinces, patriotic people in the country seem to have tried their best to promote the abolition of shark fin soup, and various restaurants have also automatically sealed their stocks. At that time, there were two reasons: (1) Most shark fin is Japanese goods and should be excluded; (2) Even if it's not Japanese goods, the price is too expensive and doesn't have much taste, so it can be canceled. Now it seems that the Japanese soldiers have not left the three northeastern provinces, and are even plotting to seize the so-called [four northeastern provinces], but the patriotic people in our country are neither patient enough to abstain from shark fin, nor do various restaurants seem to be comfortable with keeping it sealed for a long time. So, at banquets, a bowl of [major dish] has returned! I don't know if these raw materials were sealed after the September 18th Incident, or if they are newly imported from Japan, or if some big shots think they are produced in Guangdong? However, is the price of eating it now not expensive? Has the taste suddenly improved? So why not [cancel it entirely]?</p>
<p>Novel</p>
<h3>Fire of Youth</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>She had no choice but to stand up and ask, [Kai Ge, what did you forget?] Kaijun then explained that a friend had invited him yesterday to discuss some matters at the teahouse at 3 pm today, but he had forgotten. It was already past 3 o'clock. [I have to go right away.] So Kaijun used this quick wit to escape the siege of powder and rouge. Although he went out for nothing, it was much safer than the situation just now.</p>
<p>After this incident, he felt that he could no longer live here. Her fire of youth had already been ignited there, and was surrounding him. All sorts of unexpected magic might continue to attack him, so no matter how strong his heartstrings were, he couldn't withstand this tender plucking and earnest stimulation. He had to think of a way to escape as soon as possible, to avoid misleading others and creating sins. He was, after all, an old-fashioned person, unwilling to chase after this tide of desire, but wanting to learn from the ancient blunt men, letting others scold him for being numb and heartless. So, after his mother returned home, he told her about this matter. The mother and son discussed it and decided to move as soon as possible. However, was this his original wish?</p>
<p>Since he moved, she didn't come for tutoring anymore, and they naturally became estranged. Although he felt that he seemed to be a bit unkind to her, making her feel very embarrassed, there was no better way than this. Time flew by, year after year, and in the blink of an eye, two or three years had passed. Although Kaijun had gradually forgotten about this matter, his heart would still flutter a little whenever he thought of the pink ribbon and her flushed cheeks. One day, Kaijun happened to be going to Shanghai on business. When the train arrived at the Shanghai station, Kaijun got off the train and walked out of the station. Suddenly, on the platform, he saw a man and a woman walking towards him side by side. The woman was wearing an overcoat, and her cloud-like hair was permed into wavy curls, very fashionable. As they got closer, the woman suddenly saw Kaijun and nodded to him, her face slightly flushed. Kaijun looked closely and recognized her as the one he hadn't seen in years. At this time, neither of them spoke. Kaijun only nodded in return and brushed past her. He then saw the man carrying a leather suitcase, leaning close to her, very intimate, like a married couple. Kaijun thought to himself, could it be that she had found a home? If so, it wouldn't be a bad thing, but he still had doubts in his heart.</p>
<p>Later, Kaijun heard that she had indeed remarried, and he felt very relieved. He said to himself, [I hope so, so that this fire of youth will not become a poisonous flame that buries her. However, there are still many fires of youth burning in the world.] (The End)</p>
<h3>The Little Maid Next Door</h3>
<p>— Zi Wu</p>
<p>丨If She Were a Young Lady丨</p>
<p>[Squeak, squeak,] every morning I hear the little maid next door pulling the bellows. Because of the monotony of the rhythm, my soul often follows this sound to another world.</p>
<p>When she pulls the bellows, the tunes that she hums in an untrained but wonderful way come out of her vocal cords. She also keeps up with the times, able to sing ordinary popular songs, like "Little Painter," and sometimes imitates the high pitch of men, but always sings songs with a woman's low voice, [The Three Principles of the People… implement it from beginning to end].</p>
<p>When she is wronged by someone, she bursts into loud sobs, [Woooo, woooo, you, you're not human, ah….] I often hear her still sobbing when someone probably says a witty remark, and she follows it up with a hearty laugh, [Ha ha, ooh… ha, ah, ooh, ha ha ha]. One day, she glued a flag of the blue sky, white sun, and a wholly red land, with four green wavy lines in the red, to the window lattice. Her scarlet cheeks were as lovely as the red on the flag. She is still young, probably only twelve years old. Her eyes, which can also look down on people, are as dark as her own hair and eyebrows… Ah, if she were my younger sister. My younger sister got married last year. No, she is simply more beautiful and pure than my younger sister.</p>
<p>Before I moved here, a girl next door reminded me that she played melodies as soft as the spring sunshine every morning, [Ding dong, ding dong], making people feel like they no longer wanted to work. At night, someone would drive a motorcycle to pick her up for dancing. I have also seen her. Her hair is as disheveled as the disorganization of her life. She looks down on everything, but she can't help but go in and out of the back door, where the chamber pots are dumped and still stink, with the daily servants whom she looks down upon the most.</p>
<p>If the little maid next door were a young lady, like the girl next door before, then could she still [squeak, squeak] pull the bellows, hum tunes, and cry and laugh so naturally? Ah, little maid young lady.</p>
<p>Local Anecdotes</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Ordination Ceremony on Mount Putuo</h3>
<p>— Huoming</p>
<p>The Puji Temple on Mount Putuo has been holding a combined platform ordination ceremony since the day before yesterday. The Dharma masters from Mount Baohua are opening the altar, assisting, and performing the rituals there. Monks and nuns from all directions, as well as disciples of the altar, gather to worship for fifty-three days, studying the Vinaya. This is a very grand event. I remember three years ago, when I traveled to the South China Sea, I appreciated this kind of ordination ritual on the summit of Mount Buddha…</p>
<p>It was mid-September in autumn. Climbing up from the steep path of Fayu Temple, before long, the peak of Mount Buddha, famous for Guanyin, came into view. The mountain gate of Huiji Temple swallowed me in.</p>
<p>Manjushri riding a blue lion, Samantabhadra straddling a white elephant, crowded on the left and right of the Tathagata's Grand Hall. At this time, it was crowded with black robes, kasayas, and melon-like heads. The smoke-like haze, the fragrance in the smoke, was simply vast and oceanic, making people unable to open their eyes.</p>
<p>The monk who was sitting precariously on the high platform in front of the Tathagata statue was probably the barber invited by Huiji Temple. Two monks stood on either side, the [Chief Seat] on the left and the [Vina] on the right. They were answering each other in some practiced phrases. It is said that this is a kind of play acting of the Tathagata examining the disciples' precepts.</p>
<p>Then, the monks and nuns lined up in the hall had most of their worldly hair shaved off by the barber's razor, leaving only a small portion. Then, the high monk on the Dharma altar began to lecture on the scriptures. Gradually, he raised three questions: (1) Are you willing to leave your mundane world? (2) Are you willing to leave your parents, wives, and children? (3) Are you willing to leave your own flesh and blood? If everyone was not moved by this tragic tone, he would pick up a sharp knife and shave off all the hair that was left. However, at this time, because it was particularly quiet in the mountains, everyone was immersed in deeper dreams, so there was no sound of resistance or escape from the too tragic environment.</p>
<p>With this trick, the high monk took out red paper packets, one packet containing mashed jujube paste, and the other containing the remaining incense sticks after burning incense (that is, the ends of the incense, each one meter long), a total of nine grains. Another monk first smeared the mashed jujube paste on the bald heads of each person being ordained, forming a flat, round shape, and then inserted each piece of incense stick into the center of the jujube paste. The scene looked very much like nine water chestnuts placed on white felt. Then the bells, drums, and chimes rang out, and many monks and nuns with water chestnuts on their heads all put their hands together and walked around the hall in circles, which is called [returning the merits], chanting [Namo Shakyamuni Buddha!] in their mouths. The sound was as buzzing as the tide, and the sound of the bronze and iron percussion instruments echoed, and the very wooden sounding wooden fish was struck with one beat at a time.</p>
<p>After circling for some time, they restored the line of those being ordained, but they were asked to kneel on the futons. Alas, at this time, people were startled! It was the act of the greatest martyrs in the world.</p>
<p>Look, isn't that another monk holding burning incense sticks in his hand? And he used the fire from the burning incense sticks to ignite the incense sticks on the heads of those being ordained. The easily combustible incense sticks turned red, and even the jujube paste was burned. These hot sparks, these red sparks, gradually burned into the scalp under the bald head! How could they not feel pain? You think. Look, every monk and nun was jumping and stomping on the ground with their feet. They must have burned their hearts and numbed their nerves, but they were still reciting the Buddha's name, the more they recited, the more urgent it became, but the sound became lower and lower. At this time, the skin drums, bronze bells, wooden fish, and chimes in the hall all roared loudly! The mountain peaks on this late autumn afternoon were all enveloped in a sad and majestic mood. And the fragrance and smoke were steaming, describing an unspeakable depression.</p>
<p>In short, I stood far away on the steps of the Grand Hall, and at first I used curious eyes to appreciate it, but now I was shedding tears. At first, my heart, which was teased by interest, was now shattered. Why did a good head have to suffer this hardship?</p>
<p>[Hardship] is the most sublime spirit of religious devotion. Shakyamuni entered hell, and the King of Israel was nailed to the cross, but it never made people happy: although these otherworldly personalities are very great.</p>

<h3>In Praise of Health</h3>
<p>— Shiheng</p>
<p>On the cover of a magazine about Soviet Russia, there was a portrait of a Soviet girl: her face had no special features, but it displayed a special kind of health. Nothing else could better represent the characteristics of Soviet Russia than the face of this girl.</p>
<p>Health, full of new blood, is the most outstanding characteristic of present-day Soviet Russia.</p>
<p>Humanity is gradually aging, and with aging inevitably comes weakness and disease. What is frightening is not the physical suffering of humanity, but the disability of the human spirit, because of the erroneous development of the world, the environment has caused the degeneration of human life, and incurable suffering is spreading every day. Today, the entire world is like a living corpse, like a frail and emaciated old man who is only waiting for death to exhaust his energy. In the big cities of every country, you can see the same incurable disease. In Paris, in Vienna, in New York, in Berlin, in Tokyo, in Shanghai… Humans who grow up in these ferocious behemoths cannot find healthy work, let alone healthy entertainment. From birth to death, different fates divide humanity into ranks: some are destined to enjoy wine, beauties, and songs and dances; they have no work, they don't need to work. Some are destined to survive by blood and sweat; they must work, so they cannot but live in exploitation. People who live in a life of being exploited have no proper entertainment to speak of, but without entertainment, humanity cannot survive. So, a similar but inferior kind of wine, beauties, and songs and dances, anesthetizes them, making them temporarily forget their lives, forget their suffering, making them excited, making them numb. In any big city, in that world where demons have opened their eyes, you can often see an exploited worker, staggering from drinking wine, crying, shouting, cursing, while responding to this crying and shouting, you can hear the jubilant orchestra and the shouts of jubilant men and women in the nearby cafes and dance halls. There is no more tragic scene than this!</p>
<p>The life of present-day humanity is carnal desire, drunkenness, and the wailing after extreme excitement. In any demonic city, you cannot find a healthy face; all faces are sallow, emaciated, with two ferocious eyes of inhumanity shining with bestial lust. They have no life, no future, and are already standing on the line of death!</p>
<p>What method can save this inevitable destruction? 丨Infuse new blood, sow the seeds of health, like the great Slavic race is working hard!</p>
<p>Let us praise health!</p>
<h3>A Stupid Reply</h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>The other day, the newspapers reported on George Bernard Shaw's conversation at Dr. Sun Yat-sen's residence. There was a passage:</p>
<p>Shaw asked: 丨There is one thing I don't quite understand. I am a playwright, and I know that when plays are performed on stage, the audience needs to listen quietly. Why do Chinese theaters like to beat big gongs and drums so loudly? Do Chinese audiences like to listen to plays in the noise? If British children heard it, they would definitely go crazy. Mei Lanfang: 丨Chinese opera also has quiet parts, such as Kunqu opera, which doesn't use gongs and drums at all from beginning to end. I think this answer is too stupid. If George Bernard Shaw asked, 丨Why are Chinese people's complexions yellow? Isn't Mei Lanfang going to answer, 丨Chinese people also have white complexions, like me, Mei Lanfang? The form of art is inevitably determined by the material environment. Capitalist city art connoisseurs often cannot understand art that reflects rural society. George Bernard Shaw therefore wants to ask why Chinese theaters like to beat big gongs and drums so loudly. Ryunosuke Akutagawa also had this question: 丨The first characteristic of Chinese drama is the noise of the instruments is beyond imagination. At first, I was not used to listening to it. Besides covering my ears with both hands, I could never sit still. (Travels in China) The beating of big gongs and drums in Chinese theaters is indeed a post-Kunqu opera phenomenon. Kunqu opera and the earlier Northern opera, like "Romance of the Western Chamber" with string and wind instruments, are still operas in the parlor, and don't need big gongs and drums. When this kind of opera is sent to the fields and squares, the sound is too low and too quiet to suit the audience. Beating loudly is the actual need of the fields and squares.丨You won't understand the benefits of Chinese opera's gongs and drums unless you go to the rural inland of China to listen to opera.</p>
<p>A Japanese critic once said: 丨Chinese opera is loud drumming, loud shouting, and big jumping, making the audience dizzy and unsuitable for theaters, but if it is in the open air in the fields, listening and watching from afar has its own charm. There are people who understand the rural background of Chinese opera. Mei Lanfang, as a famous actor who plays Chinese opera, gave such an irrelevant answer, which is really sighing.</p>
<p>A correct and clever answer should say:</p>
<p>The use of big gongs and drums is suitable for Chinese rural theaters. The shortcoming of noise is only revealed in urban theaters. In rural theaters, it only shows its advantages. Mr. Shaw, please go to the inland of China to listen to an opera?</p>
<h3>Inland River Steamer</h3>
<p>— Ms. Peng Xuezhen</p>
<p>Traveling by inland river steamer is a new experience for me in the past two years, and it's quite interesting.</p>
<p>The steamer from Suzhou to T Town is said to be relatively advanced in terms of equipment and speed. But as soon as you stick your head into the cabin, the first thing that stimulates your nerves is the noise and chaos. Vendors carrying baskets full of cigarettes, oranges, candies, etc. shout and stand, but although the shouting is loud, few people reach out to buy. Passengers stare with their eyes fixed, patiently listening to their hopeful shouts.</p>
<p>As usual, the vendors give in, with big discounts, even half price.</p>
<p>[Selling at a loss, sir!丨] A bitter-faced man says to you.</p>
<p>More and more people buy, but they don't think about the vendors' struggle for life, but say that they are too dishonest in doing business.</p>
<p>When the boat is about to leave, the vendors are driven ashore. It is rare to see two of them carrying empty baskets and smiling.</p>
<p>When the boat leaves, the cabin is full of cigarette smoke, the carbon dioxide exhaled by people, mixed with the faintly audible scent of women's powder.</p>
<p>This is a miniature world, with farmers, workers, merchants, students, and soldiers, all kinds of people. Everyone looks at each other with the eyes of spies, guessing everything about the other person from their clothes and gestures. Every profession has its own tune.</p>
<p>The Chinese virtue of [peace] is sometimes unreliable. It is common to see people arguing and even fighting over something as small as a pinhead in a short voyage. Someone accidentally steps on someone's foot, the seats are not fair, or the person sitting next to them flicks cigarette ash over, so even the originally polite ones become impolite, cursing each other, clenching their fists. When the boat leaves Suzhou city, people are temporarily quiet. Time on the road is cheap. People are particularly comfortable, reading newspapers, talking in low voices in twos and threes, or staring blankly at the clouds, sky, mountains, and water outside the window.</p>
<h3>Black Girl's Search for God (7)</h3>
<p>— By Shaw Desmond, Translated by Xuan Xian</p>
<p>"What am I running from?" she stopped and said to herself. "I'm not afraid of that lovely, noisy old man."</p>
<p>"Your fears and hopes are merely illusions," said a voice approaching her from a very nearsighted old man sitting on a gnarled piece of wood. "You have reciprocal reactions when you run. It's very simple. Having always lived among lions, you associate roaring with the danger of death from your childhood. Hence, your frantic flight when that superstitious old donkey brayed at you. This great discovery took me twenty-five years of research, during which I dissected countless dog brains and drilled holes in their cheeks, causing saliva to flow from those holes instead of their tongues, thus observing their saliva. Scientists worldwide admire this great achievement and are grateful for the insights it has contributed to major questions about human behavior, all bowing before me."</p>
<p>"Why didn't you ask me?" the black girl said. "I could have explained it to you in twenty-five minutes, without harming those poor dogs."</p>
<p>"Your ignorance and rash judgment are unacceptable," said the nearsighted man. "This fact is, of course, known to every child; however, it has never been experimentally proven in the laboratory; therefore, scientifically speaking, it is not entirely clear. When I started, it was an unskilled guess; I have passed it down as science. Tell me, have you ever done experimental work?"</p>
<p>"Several times," said the black girl. "I'm going to do it now." Do you know, do you know, what you are sitting on?" "I am sitting on a piece of wood that has turned gray with age, covered with uneven, dilapidated bark," said the nearsighted man. "You're wrong," said the black</p>
<p>girl. "You are sitting</p>
<p>on a sleeping fish."</p>
<p>With a cry that Micah might envy, the nearsighted man stood up and ran wildly to a nearby tree, climbing it like a cat with an agility that was quite superhuman for such an elderly gentleman.</p>
<p>When people happen to talk about a topic that interests everyone, they stop and add a few words to join in the fun. When the conversation becomes lively, they become bosom friends, truly "like-minded, we are one bunch."</p>
<p>Boasting, complaining, praising others, describing oneself, especially describing one's own strengths, speaking with great enthusiasm. People always like to receive the compliments of the crowd.</p>
<p>Fried rice with eggs, tea eggs, dried tofu, choose whatever you like: those who don't buy watch, swallowing their saliva into their stomachs, pretending to be indifferent, looking outside, counting the ripples running from the ship's hull...</p>
<p>As soon as the ship stopped, everyone swarmed out like bees. Letting women, children, and the elderly go first is a fine custom, which can only be seen in European and American countries.</p>
<h3>The Present and Future of the German Women's Movement</h3>
<p>— Shu Ming</p>
<p>German women, after much struggle and because of their special contributions to the nation and society during the European War, were granted the right to vote by the German Parliament in 1918. As for electing women as members of parliament, that was in 1919, the year the German Republic was established. At that time, the parliament, although only a body for drafting a new constitution, saw the Socialist Party, the Communist Party, and even the most right-wing Catholic Party successively nominate female candidates for parliament. Those elected were from women's suffrage movement groups or women's league associations, but there were also a few women who were merely interested in politics and did not participate in any party or group. As a result of this election, there were fourteen female members of parliament, and many more women were elected in the state parliaments. Currently, in Germany, except for the National Socialist Party, it can be said that any party is in favor of women's suffrage.</p>
<p>Since gaining the right to vote, the German Women's Suffrage Association has made great efforts in political education and other matters related to women. They pay close attention to various topics, such as legislation and proposals, especially to the issue of unemployment and the economic panic, and often conduct thorough discussions, seeking to cooperate with men in finding ways to alleviate and completely resolve these problems.</p>
<p>Today, German women truly have a great influence in society, not just a few women showing off in parliament. Whether in the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Labor, or the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, women occupy very high positions, some even serving as directors of social movement bureaus or holding key positions in youth bureaus. They are very serious about their work, which is truly admirable. Originally, the purpose of German women's suffrage was not just to seize a few seats in parliament and occupy a few positions in various fields; their purpose was to pave a new path for future generations of women and to truly do something for the country. Since the implementation of women's suffrage, it has been fourteen years, during which women have demonstrated many amazing achievements, and Germany itself has indeed gained a great harvest. Their efforts are now generally recognized. However, the German women's suffrage movement is now facing a major crisis, which is the rise of Hitlerism.</p>
<p>Although Hitler promotes national socialism, he and his followers do not support women's suffrage. They treat women like Jews. Now that the party is in power, German women may only be able to retreat completely into the home. Many people often say: the rise of Hitlerism is the end of German women's suffrage. This is a very worrying matter.</p>

<h3>Social Climate and Popular Sentiment</h3>
<p>— Geng</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, the call for solidarity and overcoming national difficulties has been as loud as the fanfare of a clearance sale, reaching the clouds. But has the national crisis broken through the encirclement and cut a bloody path after a year and a half? Looking through a microscope, one sees that the cells of the entire national body are almost all infected with the germs of national subjugation. Looking through a telescope, one sees that the future national difficulties are likely to come one after another. The nation's corruption has reached this point, which is probably unprecedented in history. Analyzing the reasons, although quite complex, the public sentiment that "in normal times is like a stagnant pool of water, and in times of crisis is only like a stone thrown in, causing a slight ripple" is the main root cause of all the disasters!</p>
<p>The violent Japanese occupied Shenyang in less than six hours, and annexed Liaoning and Jilin in less than a week, eventually sweeping across the Northeast. The people of the country can certainly severely blame the Northeast officials for listening to the songs of [Hou Ting Hua] and not taking precautions, but when the strategic pass of Yuguan was lost, wasn't it also sent away amidst the New Year's celebrations, with gongs and firecrackers resounding all night long? In addition, there are countless people who indulge in the revelry of movie theaters and dance halls. This kind of public sentiment that "does not know the hatred of national subjugation" is mostly seen in big cities. Isn't this due to the "commercialization of women"? Others, such as the general inland villagers who only know how to "beat their bellies and sing, what does the Emperor's power have to do with me" in years of good harvest, or who only know how to "burn incense and pray for the birth of a true Son of Heaven" in years of famine or war, also account for the majority of the so-called "people of the country." If one were to impose upon these folks a public sentiment capable of dealing with serious national difficulties, then it would be a question of where to begin in the twenty-four histories. It is disheartening to talk about the stagnant public sentiment. Then how can we talk about social customs that can give people a good impression? I will leave aside the grand issues and take the news reported a couple of days ago about Ms. Chen Ruihua, a famous socialite in Guangzhou, who raised donations to help the Northeast Volunteer Army, as an example of the reaction of some readers. The newspaper clearly stated: "Ms. Chen, as a weak woman, cannot serve on the battlefield, so she especially contributes her beauty to the nation... Recently, large sums of money have been remitted to the Northeast Volunteer Army." This kind of clear patriotic "heart" and "action," which can utilize individual superior characteristics and take a roundabout way to achieve practical results in saving the country, can be said to be comparable in value to the previous donation of calligraphy by Jiu San Sou Ma Xiangbo and the donation of painting exhibitions by Central Committee member He Xiangning. This is hardly an overstatement. Unexpectedly, some people, wearing the big-framed glasses of the eighteenth century, criticized Ms. Chen for this admirable patriotic act, which can also give a glimpse of the corruption of social customs!</p>
<p>However, Zeng Guofan once said, "The strength or weakness of social customs depends on the aspirations of one or two people." If we acknowledge the validity of this statement, then how to shoulder the great responsibility of supporting public sentiment and cultivating social customs in the future does not seem to be solely the responsibility of the people of the country who have a share in everything.</p>

<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>

<h3>A Meal in a University Dormitory</h3>
<p>— Shen Zhi</p>
<p>丨The life of a university student today!</p>
<p>It was a few days before the school was about to start winter vacation last month, and as the sun was setting, I went from the company to a university dormitory to find a friend I hadn't seen in a long time. My friend welcomed me and invited me to have dinner and chat. They were indeed extremely happy. There were four of them in the same dormitory, and they ate together. I didn't see a single book on their desks: I was wrong, how could there be no books, there were many pictures, even more pictorials, and photos of movie stars, ah, very rich!</p>
<p>About half an hour before dinner, one of them, a young man in a Western suit, said to my friend: "Old Li, if you're inviting guests to dinner like this, shouldn't you invite a few people to keep us company?" "Isn't it good enough to have you guys keep me company?" My friend Old Li replied. The young man in the Western suit quickly said: "What's the point of that? You should invite your girlfriends to accompany us for dinner, that's what gives life meaning. If a dignified university student invites a friend to dinner and doesn't even have a Miss as a guest, then we're having our bad luck dumped on us! Hurry up!"</p>
<p>It turned out that the so-called Old Li had become quite modern in the past six months. Many modern Misses among his classmates were on good terms with him, which he had been hiding from me before. Now, he was forced and coerced by the young man in the Western suit and had no choice but to make it public. So the two of them went out the door. Before long, the "tap-tap" sound of high-heeled shoes and the soft voices of laughter came from outside the door. Old Li pushed the door in first and stood to the side, saying respectfully: "Miss, please come in!" The few of us who were talking at the time all said to the three Misses who came in: "Truly honored! So many Misses have graced our humble abode with their presence." Everyone was scrambling to get chairs, pour water, and hang up coats. Old Li also forgot to introduce me, so I had no choice but to watch silently. Fortunately, one of the Misses came directly to ask me: "What is this gentleman's name?" Before I could answer, Old Li hurriedly said for me: "This is Mr. T, the new thinker who first advocated for women's liberation, and he now works in a bank with a very high income." What was particularly strange about this introduction was "very high income," which I didn't quite understand at the time. The three Misses nodded and smiled at me, saying: "So you're Mr. T, whom Miss Li often mentions, we were just about to ask for your advice!"</p>
<p>Ah, I really didn't dare to accept their advice. The women's liberation I advocated for is definitely not the liberation that modern women demand. Old Li then introduced me, saying: "These three Misses are all my classmates, this one is Miss C, a classmate, this one is Miss W, a third-year student, and that one is the girlfriend of the young man in the Western suit, Miss L. They are all very good at singing and dancing." Upon this introduction, Miss L's face turned a little pink, while the young man in the Western suit seemed quite proud, and said to Old Li: "Old Li, now we can set the table for dinner, this is what it looks like when a university student invites a friend to dinner." As he said this, he smiled at his girlfriend.</p>
<p>We ate dinner, but immediately began to laugh and chat. The Misses were all quite talkative. C sat on my right and showed me particular sincerity, as if we were very familiar, asking this and that, asking how many lovers I had, and asking which kind of woman I thought was most lovable? My answer was: "I only have one lover, she is not modern, she is my companion in hardship, she is a truly liberated woman, she is able to endure all kinds of hardships." At this moment, Old Li made a gesture at me with his eyes and touched my foot with his foot, as if to tell me: "Don't be so serious about women, modern women are just things for us men to play with: since she asked you this, it means she wants you to say, 'I don't have any other lovers, I love women like you the most.' This makes her very happy in her heart." Ah, this was also Old Li's experience, but my conscience was unwilling to accept this experience of his. The young man in the Western suit and L were sitting on the same side, just talking and laughing with each other, and hardly ate any food. W was relatively quiet, but she also revealed a lot: "So-and-so and so-and-so are doing very well now, so-and-so is very pessimistic now, so-and-so has become a famous socialite, a newly returned doctor from overseas also came to the school to find her, inviting her to the Cathay to see a movie, to Yi Pin Xiang to eat a big meal, and also bought a lot of expensive things at Sincere Company, and took her back in a car, it is said that he spent more than three hundred yuan that day, she is really lucky!" After finishing the meal, they talked about love affairs and celebrities</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>. At seven o'clock, the young man in the Western suit insisted on treating us to refreshments again. It turned out that the reason he insisted on inviting female classmates to accompany us for dinner was that "his mind was not on the wine"! After eating the refreshments, I said goodbye and went back, but they were still staying in the dormitory, and said they were going to see a movie too, and had already called for a car.</p>
<h3>A Way Out</h3>
<p>— Er Chu</p>
<p>Although he was a young man not yet twenty years old, he considered himself a healthy adult, a good man of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>The crisis of the nation, the humiliation of the country, made him worried and angry. He knew that the motherland needed him, and he was not as numb as the so-called young people standing on the line of the times. Whenever he was with people, he liked to talk about the policy of saving the country, all kinds of international meetings... His attitude was so tragic, his words were so solemn, but the result was that he was given the bad names of "crazy" and "outdated."</p>
<p>His father always advised him to study foreign books, and not to be so crazy all the time. But this was fundamentally not to his liking. He loved to read newspapers, especially news about current affairs and righteous armies.</p>
<p>His father's stubbornness, his friends' ridicule, and the逼迫 of poverty, he did not take it seriously: he was used to a lonely life.</p>
<p>The loss of Yuguan, the urgent situation in Rehe, made him unable to bear it any longer and insisted on joining the Volunteer Army. But his father, where would he let him run? He then felt great pain, and on the other hand, he mourned the death of the Chinese people's hearts. In reality, the position in which China is currently in is impossible to save. The youth of the intellectual class, the dignified university students, are still dreaming peach-colored dreams, hoping.</p>
<p>He thought that since it was impossible to join the Righteous Army, he would carry out propaganda: only the power of propaganda is greatest, the effectiveness of propaganda is greatest, so he carried a long bench and chose a crowded place to carry out propaganda.</p>
<p>He walked onto the street and saw a place where the road was being repaired, with a sign placed next to it, which said: This road is closed.] He put down the long bench here and began to lecture:]...We all know: China is our China. On the land of the Republic of China, we must never allow those beasts to stay for long... Dear compatriots! We are citizens of the Republic of China. If the Republic of China is rich and strong, our citizens will naturally be rich and strong. However, if the Republic of China is weak, we will also be weak. If the Republic of China perishes, are we willing to forcibly be slaves of a conquered nation? Huh! No! This is a big mistake. If the Republic of China is weak, we should strive to rouse our spirits, strive to recover, and make the Republic of China a strong country in the world. Now what kind of China is our China? Of course, we all know that it is in a state of extreme danger. Look! Our sovereignty is being exploited! Our land is being cut up every day! Our compatriots are being trampled on forever! In reality, our Republic of China is just like this street; you see these four characters [This road is closed], the reason why this road is closed: it is because of the damage to the street. Then, will our country, like this street, never be passable? Will our country always be weak and bullied? I think: you all know that as long as these workers complete the repairs, won't this street be passable? Isn't there one more way out? Since our country has so many people, can't we also, like the workers, rouse our spirits, strive to fight, to reform our country, wouldn't there also be a way out?" He shouted and spoke hoarsely, almost becoming mute. However, no matter how he shouted, there were always few listeners, so he sighed and went back dejectedly.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Pullers and Young Masters' Education</h3>
<p>— John</p>
<p>丨丨Reply to Mr. [Yu] [A Rickshaw Puller's Son]丨丨</p>
<p>I remember that a week or so ago, a Mr. [Yu Yi] raised a question for discussion in this magazine, and after reading his article, I really wanted to say a few words. First, I have great doubts about what Mr. [Yu] described: that is, in today's society, especially in Shanghai, a society that shows deformity in everything and reveals contradictions everywhere, can a [rickshaw puller] whose nutrition is still insufficient, who never gets enough sleep, and whose legs have to keep moving all day long, struggling desperately under the whip of life, allow his son to go to school until he graduates from junior high school? Does the fact allow his son to step into the noble threshold and enjoy the happiness of a young master's, a gentleman's education? Taking a hundred steps back, the [rickshaw puller] in Mr. [Yu]'s writing is an exception among exceptions, and his son is simply the proud [son] among [rickshaw] pullers], but, taking the sweat, blood, panting, and fleshly feet, and [earning] the money that [the gentleman adds a copper], the money is permeated with sweat, blood, breath, and flesh, and in the eyes of a [rickshaw puller], no matter how exceptional he is, I think, at least I think, no one would absolutely let his son go to school and complete secondary education! Moreover, the facts do not allow it?</p>
<p>Second, let's take what Mr. [Yu] said as a real existing fact, then we naturally express infinite admiration and sympathy for this [rickshaw puller]. As for his disappointing [junior high school graduate] who [put on a little foreign air] and finally [stole the foreign money and clothes from home] and ran away, on the one hand, we will certainly learn the faces of those who are used to blaming others and scold him as a young man who [cannot endure hardship and does not understand service]: it is his own fault that he has nothing to do and no food to eat! However, on the other hand, we should express our utmost indignation and regret for this unfortunate young man! We are indignant that his father should never have sent a born capable young man to a young master's manufacturing place for a speed course; we regret even more that if he could have inherited his father's career from the beginning of his life, or could have broken into another world to be a creator, at least, at least, he would never have been infected with foreign air and have no work and no food, to the point of stealing things from his home to go out and be a street tramp, what an unfortunate thing! What a great loss and pain this gives him in his life!</p>
<p>Although this is an extremely serious social problem: but, the so-called education in front of our eyes is indeed the main cause of this problem! So it itself has long become a huge problem!</p>
<p>However, [the rickshaw puller] took his own biological son, a capable young man, and sent him alive to be sentenced, no matter how you say it, it is too uneconomical and worthy of us expressing our utmost indignation and regret!!! If what Mr. [Yu] said is true.</p>

<h3>Anguish Like Losing One's Soul</h3>
<p>— Wang Baosheng</p>
<p>To the esteemed Editor:</p>
<p>I am an office worker at a certain company, and my monthly salary is quite sufficient for my expenses. Therefore, in terms of material things, I can be considered fairly content. However, there is one matter that causes me immense pain. My best female friend, who is also my beloved, is the same age as me, nineteen this year. I met her two years ago. At that time, she was indeed an innocent and lively girl. Unfortunately, in the past year, she made several bad friends and often went out to see movies and gamble. Sometimes, she even went to some famous clubs or companies to gamble. When she gambled late into the night, she would open a room with a few girlfriends and stay outside. Her family, consisting of only her mother and elder brother, had no idea about these activities and still believed she was staying at a friend's house. In recent weeks, I have also learned that she has another lover! Moreover, this lover of hers is my best friend! I have long been dissatisfied with her behavior. Now, for the sake of my friend, I wrote her a letter last week to break up with her. It seems that this should be the end of it. But in my heart, I still feel extremely depressed, as if I have lost my soul. When I work, I inevitably perform much worse, which is why I often get scolded at the company. Esteemed Editor, you are a wise and talented person. Please tell me, how can I get rid of this anguish? Respectfully and sincerely yours, Wang Baosheng.</p>
<p>Editor's Note: In the minds of Chinese people, it seems that [heroes] and [beauties] are absolutely not allowed to have a relationship. However, we can find examples like [Overturning countries and captivating cities, turning Zhou Lang into a famous figure] not only in history, but also often see facts like Mr. Wang losing the courage to work due to [being lovelorn]. We encourage those who have already obtained [flower-like beauties] to work harder to develop their careers. However, we cannot tolerate the decadence of those who are [lovelorn]. Our lifeline is [career]. No matter what, we must move forward on this bright road with firm steps. As for beauties, they can only sometimes serve as a spur to make us move faster. Even without this spur, we must still keep going!</p>
<p>Mr. Wang's admiration for his girlfriend was originally due to her [innocence and liveliness]. Now that she has lost this lovely virtue and instead acquired many contemptible bad habits, she is fundamentally no longer qualified to be loved. Therefore, Mr. Wang's decisive break up with her is the best thing to do. As for the current anguish, we have thought of a way for you, guaranteed to drive it away. Since you are a person who has found a solution in the material aspect, and there are many good women in the world, you might as well start today to look for someone better than your current girlfriend. However, we also advise Mr. Wang to get married quickly after finding a lover, because this can prevent the other woman from being assimilated by the evil society, like your current girlfriend! At the same time, before finding a lover, use your leisure time to engage in beneficial pastimes, such as sports, music, art, and so on. This can both divert your mind and prevent you from being overly [unable to let go]. At the same time, you can also get considerable benefits from these noble pastimes.</p>
<p>We believe that Mr. Wang can also tell your male friends about her recent bad behavior, apart from your love history, and ask them to persuade this fallen girl. Perhaps, because they are in a fiery period of love, it might have a good effect. This way, you can not only be worthy of your old friend, but also not have been in a good relationship with her in vain.</p>

<h3>Family of Scholars (Continued from 26)</h3>
<p>— Wang Zhongxian</p>
<p>Thirteen: A Family of Scholars Falls into the Realm of Petty Merchants</p>
<p>Ruo Hua was so angry that she almost fainted. Fearing that she would make a scene, You Zhong repeatedly begged for forgiveness and expressed his repentance. With tears in her eyes, she said:</p>
<p>[I have taken many risks for you, and I have done things that disregarded my life for you. I wish I could dig out my heart]</p>
<p>to treat you, but in the end, I still can't win your heart! As for Dai Qiu, I advise you to give up on her. She hates you to the bone, she wants to bite your flesh, she curses you to die early. These are all things she told me herself. If it weren't for you being my lover, she would have stopped recognizing you as her uncle long ago. I advise you to wake up!]</p>
<p>[I understand now, but Dai Qiu and I see each other every day, and my heart can't help but think about her. I never want to see her again in this life. Either she leaves me, or I leave her.]</p>
<p>[That's easy. You say: I am afraid that being with you as husband and wife will ruin your family's reputation. Then, let's switch]</p>
<p>to a different place to live. People will only know that we are husband and wife, and who else will come to get to the bottom of things? Besides, since you have done something illegal, I am worried about you living here. Anyway, I am going to die with you.]</p>
<p>[If we leave, what about Dai Qiu?]</p>
<p>[You still think about her? Just leave her to take care of the house. Let her choose for herself. I am not] asking about her affairs anymore. The more I think about this place, the more dangerous it seems. Let's leave tonight! The farther away, the better.] After thinking for a while, You Zhong suddenly begged again: [I am afraid that we will never come back after we leave. I want to]</p>
<p>ask you to allow me to talk to Dai Qiu for half an hour, so that I can leave some money for her, so that she can live.] Ruo Hua said: [She won't give you a good face. If you are afraid of being scolded, then go see her, but I won't allow you to] take too long!</p>
<p>[You hurry up and pack your luggage, and I will be back in twenty minutes.]</p>
<p>You Zhong left, and Ruo Hua hurriedly called the maid to come in and pack her luggage. She packed more than a dozen large leather suitcases. Looking at the clock, it had been more than half an hour. Just as she was about to urge You Zhong, she suddenly saw Old Hu running in, covered in sweat, reporting: [A Hai has been arrested by the police. I don't know what big case he committed. I heard that it also involves the Fifth Young Master]</p>
<p>!]</p>
<p>Before Old Hu could finish speaking, Ruo Hua hurriedly ran inside. When she ran to Dai Qiu's door, she saw her and You Zhong coming out hand in hand. She had changed into clothes for going out, holding a small leather suitcase in one hand and a coat in the other. You Zhong was also carrying a suitcase. Ruo Hua ran up and pulled You Zhong, saying: [A Hai has been arrested. We have to]</p>
<p>go!]</p>
<p>Dai Qiu hugged You Zhong's arm. You Zhong broke away from Ruo Hua and protected Dai Qiu as they rushed out. Ruo Hua desperately tried to catch up, grabbing You Zhong's clothes, asking breathlessly:</p>
<p>[Have you gone crazy?]</p>
<p>You Zhong, while trying to shake her off, said very simply: [Dai Qiu has agreed to marry me! She is willing to]</p>
<p>run away with me, don't stop us!]</p>

<h3>The Past of Janet Gaynor and Charles Farrell</h3>
<p>— Xirong</p>
<p>Janet is free... Can they get back together?</p>
<p>The divorce of cinema queen Janet Gaynor from her [imperial consort] Lydell Peck has already been reported in yesterday's newspaper. This occurred just a month after the movie emperor Charles Farrell left Fox, so naturally many people say that Janet Gaynor's [legal divorce] is closely related to her and Charles Farrell's [screen divorce]. Let's explore the clues and make an imaginary conclusion.</p>
<p>First, Janet's friendship with Charles is real. Charles himself has said that he and Janet have the affection of siblings. Second, Janet met Lydell first. When Janet first met Lydell, she and Charles already had a very obvious romance. Third, Janet married Lydell in a very short period of acquaintance, and it was not announced in advance. Even Charles was surprised. Fourth, Janet and Lydell's opinions were not in harmony after their marriage, but Janet had her own hidden reasons and refused to tell anyone. Fifth, Janet's divorce did not involve [another person]. Janet has absolutely no romantic affairs, and Lydell has not been criticized for any irregularities.</p>
<p>The above points are indeed facts known to the public, which we can use as a basis for testing. The remaining Hollywood rumors, for which the evidence is not very conclusive, are: (1) Janet's marriage to Lydell was to spite Charles, a kind of spite marriage, an act of revenge against Charles. She had no deep love for Lydell, so the marriage was very hasty, and there was no joy after the marriage, because her heart was of course inseparable from Charles. (2) After Janet's marriage, Charles immediately took a ship and sailed away from Hollywood. This was Charles's intention to temporarily avoid the pain in his heart. (3) A little more than a year after Janet's marriage, Charles also hastily married a female actress, Virginia Valli, in New York, and immediately took a ship to Europe for their honeymoon after the marriage. It is said that this was because Charles was extremely heartbroken and could no longer bear it, so he came up with this [you can do this, so can I] attitude. (4) Charles's departure from Fox and the screen was because he had been bound by the contract for six or seven years, performing passionate scenes every day with his [pipa-holding] lover. The more painful the wounded heart, the more he had to take the road of escape. (5) Janet also knew the truth of Charles's departure from the screen, but after thinking hard, she could not comfort him, so she had to divorce Lydell to show that she had no other thoughts.</p>
<p>Putting together the five facts with real evidence and the five arguments with not very conclusive evidence, they already feel like they are tit for tat, and they fit together with a snap. It is as if all the scenes and segments of the film are complete, and only need to be edited and matched to become a very good film. So now we only need to do some editing work.</p>
<p>How should Charles and Janet's affairs be edited and matched? Originally, [I heard] that they had been engaged. However, Charles had an earlier girlfriend [who was an actress]. They were very close. After becoming engaged to Janet, he could not break off with her for a while. Once, Charles invited Janet and two male friends to go on a boat trip. Before they were about to set off, that girlfriend suddenly called Charles to discuss something with him. Charles had no choice but to tell her to wait for him at the dock. Unexpectedly, one of Charles's two friends was a traitor, and he secretly called Janet, saying that Charles intended to take that actress on the boat trip with them. Janet was very angry when she heard this, because she had repeatedly warned Charles not to associate with that actress, and Charles had also promised not to associate with her again. Now that the old relationship had not been broken, it was obvious that his love was not exclusive. So Janet did not board the boat either. She had only known Lydell for a short time, and because Lydell was very interested in her, she agreed to marry Lydell in a fit of anger, and thus a big mistake was made, leaving a lifetime of regret. Now, although Janet has divorced Lydell, Charles has married that actress. Whether they can also divorce and allow Charles to get back together with Janet is still a big question.</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3>Review of "Lovelorn"</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>It is obvious that Chinese films have indeed progressed very quickly in the past one or two years. If we take the short history of Chinese films as a ratio, then we must admit that the speed of this progress is indeed amazing. However, precisely because of the short history, many film practitioners have not been able to achieve satisfactory technical results due to sufficient experience. After watching Mingxing Company's "Lovelorn," I had the above feeling. The story of "Lovelorn" is aimed at certain modern [upper-class Chinese] and scolds them severely. It also explains that they have no way out in the future, which is very sympathetic to the audience. However, after feeling happy, how will the audience eliminate these Chinese scum? How can they seek liberation for themselves? This is what "Lovelorn" has neglected and has not clearly pointed out. Isn't this a shortcoming of this film? Originally, for such a subject matter, we can find many real examples. Although it is not necessary to insert a little romance, it is not necessary to make romance the main stem. Such as floods, anti-imperialism, anti-corrupt officials, etc., can all become the center. Then, since the structure of this film is like this, of course the director has to work hard on the point of romance, so that people can understand the plot at a glance. In some scenes, we can see the director's skillful skills. However, there are also bad scenes, such as the officers in the train talking about Meilin, such as Wenan being beaten by the brigade commander, which are inevitably exaggerated, and there are many others. In particular, the scene where the brigade commander directs the troops to advance is really too naive, but the ending of this drama is unique and not conventional, which is certainly the director's greatest success. As for Zhang Zhiyun's performance, it can be said to be the most successful one in this film. Her movements and expressions show that she is rich in experience. However, she did not have obvious changes throughout the play, especially when she finally realized her way out, she was still so sad and could not be positive. It can be said that it is her shortcoming. [Huaiqiu fully tells us in this film that it is not easy to go from stage to screen. Yan Yuexian appeared skillful in several scenes in the middle. Also, Wang Weixin is too unsuitable for the character Zhou Guocai. There are also several other officers, who I dare not praise. As for the scenery, the front is rich and gorgeous, and the back reveals traces of being fake. The lighting is acceptable. The sound is very good, especially the bell, but the sound of the train is not like it. Overall, the first half is better than the second half. In this film, you can find traces of the progress of Mingxing Company.</p>

<h3>Karen Morley's Secret Marriage</h3>
<p>— Chen</p>
<p>Karen Morley is like Greta Garbo. Although she does not completely refuse interviews with reporters, she is less willing to talk about her own affairs than any other star. Even her [happy marriage] two months ago was kept secret. Last autumn, Karen merely announced that she was engaged to the young foreign director Charles Vidor (who has no relation to King Vidor). She did not wear an engagement ring. She also did not determine a date for the wedding. It is said that she once told people in the photography studio that she would tell people when she decided on a date. Later, reporters and radio reporters insisted that she was married, but she neither admitted nor denied it. Until the people in the photography studio asked her to declare the truth, she said: [I am not married. Why would I do it in secret? I will tell you when I have a date. Maybe she has already told the photography studio, and the people in the photography studio kept it a secret for her before the new film [Flesh] Flesb was finished, so as to avoid the reporters' disturbance. After [Flesh] was completed, she announced that she had married Charles on November 5 in Santa Ana, California. When she announced it, she was free to embark on a long honeymoon trip. This news</p>
<p>Before she announced it, she absolutely did not</p>
<p>her fiancé worked in the same place. He was never seen with her in public to avoid being surrounded by reporters. This is commendable.</p>
<p>Audience Opinion</p>
<h3>Spring Waves and Beautiful Shadows Reflect New Light</h3>
<p>— Yifu</p>
<p>Last year, "Spring Waves and Beautiful Shadows" Monte</p>
<p>Carlo Madness, a Ufa film that shared the same fame as [Dragon and Phoenix Dance] in European and American countries, will be screened at the New Light Grand Theater tonight. This is a Romanric musical comedy that describes the love history of a queen. Its style is completely different from [Dragon and Phoenix Dance] or [Rainbow Fairy]. [The heroine, Loretta Young, is a European female star who came to Hollywood not long ago. Although she has made films in the United States, she has never been as moving as in the film [Spring Waves and Beautiful Shadows]], this is a review in an American newspaper.</p>
<p>This film, although the same as Ernst Lubitsch's [Monte Carlo], is a completely musicalized romance film; however, the composition of the story is absolutely different, and this [Spring Waves and Beautiful Shadows] was indeed filmed in Monte Carlo. Just the entire Monte Carlo landscape with the mountains and the sea, and the love songs broadcasted under the moonlight, and the spring waves reflecting in the morning light, are enough for us to miss.</p>
<h3>Watching the Bright Moon Go</h3>
<p>— Xia Shuxun</p>
<p>In the light night wind and drizzle, I hurried to the Beijing Grand Theater to watch the moving Bright Moon. But when I stepped into the theater, it was already full of people, and the ticket office also hung up the sign [Upstairs and downstairs are full].</p>
<p>In a moment, the lights in the theater suddenly turned dark, and the music slowly changed from faint to loud. Then the audience became silent, quietly watching the lively group of girls shrouded in red, green, and yellow light. They also sang [Brave Youth] along with the music. A series of scenes followed in order, and then it was our Wild Rose singing [Poor Qiuxiang]. At this time, the audience doubled their spirits and listened quietly to this exciting tune.</p>
<p>Her melodious voice, graceful figure, lively expression, and fine dance steps broke the record of Miss Li. The last scene is Wang Renmei's life's exploration, [Wild Rose] which won cheers on this screen. Here, you can really see everything of her nature, revealing her [wild child]'s crude but delightful nature.</p>
<h3>McDonald Suddenly Goes to Europe</h3>
<p>— Hua Ming</p>
<p>Jeanette McDonald suddenly left the United States for Europe. No one in Hollywood knew before McDonald's departure. McDonald was accompanied by McDonald's secretary, mother, driver, and maid. She also brought McDonald's favorite lion dog. A week before McDonald's departure, her fiancé, Bobk</p>
<p>itchie went to Europe, probably to arrange a house in Europe first. Hollywood does not know why McDonald went to Europe, and Heiferley is also tight-lipped. Many people speculate that she may have been recruited by the British film industry, but her destination is France, which does not seem right. Some people say that she is going to travel, but why is she so secretive? McDonald's trip is really a bit difficult to grasp her reason.</p>
<p>Overseas Tidbits</p>
<h3>Birds and Beasts on the Screen</h3>
<p>— Huang Yingdai</p>
<p>In movies, we often find many birds and animals. They can cleverly follow the director's instructions and shoot movies. Among the birds, we think that parrots are the smartest. In the film "Animal World," it has already been proved to us. However, pre-training is an indispensable event. It is said that training a parrot to appear on the screen, in a day, it can learn a simple dialogue. Many animals, when released to film movies, often escape. Among them, the escape of moths is the most. The owner of the shooting "Animal World" said that when [a hundred moths] are raised, released to make them fly in the light, when shooting the film, the psychology also hopes that they can come back, but only ten. The same expectation is in the hope that bees, butterflies, mosquitoes, etc. can be recovered after being released. Sometimes, a wild duck will also escape. [I have more than a hundred birds, thirty-five] dogs, thirty cats, and four hundred other animals, ready for photography. In addition, I have an eagle. When I send it a secret signal, it will call out. There is an owl that can take things. Four foxes, when I send a slogan, they will mourn. [Wild animals in the mountains in the animal world are not raised, but bears, mink, foxes, crows, chickens, pigs, mules, snakes, spiders, peacocks, bats, lizards, etc., in terms of value, have cost 20 English pounds.</p>

<h3>Li Pingqian Self-Written [Harvest Year]</h3>
<p>— Guo Ye</p>
<p>In 1932, the tide of [transformation] impacted the actors and directors. Those who were unwilling to be submerged under the wheels of the times resolutely transformed. The director with the small mustache, Li Pingqian, is also one who tends to advance. However, since he transferred to Mingxing Company, it can be said that he has not made any major contributions to our audience. Although there are films such as [Old Hatreds and New Sorrows] and [Pipa Spring Grievances], they have not achieved any great success. Such [sorrow] overlapping, [hatred] long, [grievance] heavy, made Li Pingqian himself tired of it. Recently, I got a message: he is finally going to cheer up and bravely rise up. The first step of the struggle is his own screenplay [Harvest Year]. The play depicts the rural situation in economic bankruptcy: in the years of famine, everyone longs for a harvest year; but when the harvest year arrives, the hardworking farmers are even more distressed, and they will starve to death. We have faith in Mr. Li's cleverness. May he bravely run to the forefront of the times 丨丨 grab the crowd, deeply into the crowd!</p>
<p>Film Novel</p>
<h3>Broadway Romance</h3>
<p>— Yuqing</p>
<p>[She's not here? Oh, your clothes are all wet. Let me take off your coat.] Millie busily helped him take off his coat and sit down. [Why haven't I seen you in so long? We haven't seen each other since you and Panqi got engaged! I want to congratulate you and wish you]</p>
<p>[Endless happiness.] [Thank you.]</p>
<p>[You don't seem very happy. Why?]</p>
<p>[Sigh, what's the point of talking about it? You wouldn't understand.]</p>
<p>[I wouldn't understand!] Millie said, knowing her chance for revenge had come. [You say I wouldn't understand, do you think I'm stupid? Who would understand if I didn't? To tell you the truth, before I met you and Mark, I walked around on Broadway every day, wore out who knows how many pairs of shoes, met so many friends, and had so much fun.</p>
<p>When Zhanmei heard her words, he was stunned. He asked, [Did Panqi go out with you every day too?]</p>
<p>[Oh,] Millie said mockingly, [no, Panqi is a good person, I'm a bad person. Let me tell you the truth, Panqi is not much better!] She's willing to do things I wouldn't do!] After Millie said this, she suddenly realized she had said the wrong thing and quickly covered her throat. But the words were already spoken and could not be taken back. She shouted crazily again, [How can you say I don't understand love? Why do you say I don't understand?] But it was too late, Zhanmei wouldn't let her speak anymore; he left. Millie was still shouting behind him, [Zhanmei, come back! Zhanmei, listen!] Zhanmei left without even turning his head.</p>
<p>Zhanmei hadn't gone far when he met Panqi returning.</p>
<p>[Zhanmei!] she called out to him. [Where are you going? Why didn't you come to the marriage license bureau? I waited until it closed before coming back.]</p>
<p>[I just called you, Mark answered and said he understood as soon as he saw you.] [Indeed, I understand now too. Have you always been so confused?] [What do you mean by that?]</p>
<p>[You just need to tell me one thing,] Zhanmei almost became a rude person. [Do you remember our first night?] You told me how to love me, how you are a moral person, all that kind of talk? [Oh! How could that be a lie?]</p>
<p>[Okay, you just need to tell me, after I left that night, did Mark go to your room?] Panqi was so scared that she took a step back.</p>
<p>[Just answer me that one question. Did he go to your room or not?] He hesitated for a moment and said falteringly, [He did come, but you have to listen to me.] [No need to say any more, that's enough.] Zhanmei left in a hurry. (To be continued)</p>
