<p>華盛頓會議之進展</p>
<h3>美國放棄金本位後英美經濟討論範圍擴大</h3>
<p>羅斯福與麥唐納意見多接近</p>
<p>恢復金本位辦法交專家研究</p>
<p>法亦注重穩定金融解决戰債</p>
<p>國民二十二日華盛頓電美總統羅斯福與英首相麥唐納初僅擬非正式討論世界問題、乃今日談話結果已成爲英美經濟總會議之局面、據白宮於談話後發表之公報、兩人已同意將許多技術問題交付英美專家討論、兩國專家將於今日下午開始工作、而總統與首相則仍繼續談話、蓋自美國放棄金本位後、已大行擴張討論範圍、不得不有經濟專家與顧問之較正式會議也、</p>
<h3>專家會同研究</h3>
<p>聞今日在白宮談話時、羅斯福撮述其所認爲英美兩國現有之重要經濟問題、麥唐納亦發意見、於是兩人遂有許多完全同意之點、惟覺每一經濟問題必須交由專家研究、現英大使林德賽與美國務卿赫爾俱會同專家討論、而美參院外交委員會主席畢德門、國務院經濟專家斐亞士、與曾代總統調查歐洲經濟情形之弼立德等亦均出席專家會議、</p>
<h3>英美諒解可期</h3>
<p>至羅麥兩人談話詳情、白宮仍照向例不予發表、但華盛頓人人深信、交付專家研究之問題、必係英美之恢復金本位及其實施辦法、至各主要經濟問題此時仍爲兩執政談話目標、正在繼續討論之中、聞明日兩人或將同駕總統游艇、於侵晨出發、循波多邁克河泛舟暢談、逆料至明日夜間當能對於英美在世界經濟會議中將採之立場商得諒解也、此層顯爲此次談話之目的、至關於金融問題之彼此諒解、尚居其次、故世界經濟會議中所有之問題、此次將無一不加以討論、惟美國此時金融界形勢將使他日世界經濟會議中不無變更討論之趨向耳、</p>
<h3>世界經濟問題</h3>
<p>路透二十二日華盛頓電英首相麥唐納與美總統羅斯福之週杪會議、今晨十一時、在白宮中可俯視波吐瑪克河之議室開始、參加會議者、有國務卿赫爾與英大使林德賽、而美總統與英首相之顧問亦咸與會、戰債問題曾提出討論、但美總統迄今祗以國際大局爲言、美總統以爲如減少各種貨幣準備金、則通貨之發行可增多、結果可使各處物價漲起、衆料英美對於貨幣、未必有切實約定、但或可成立一種（紳士協定、）今晨會議後雙方發表聯合文告、謂談話至十二時四十五分休會、雙方考慮世界經濟會議之主要問題、而議定將此問題先交專家研究、專家定今日午後着手討論云</p>
<h3>廢金本位用意</h3>
<p>國民二十二日華盛頓電美國今日之膨脹通貨戰、似將完全在本國之内純屬内政問題、國務卿赫爾今日已通告駐在英法德意四國之大使、謂此次放棄金本位純爲應付國内環境與增加世界物價起見、絶無用作國際談判武器之意、囑將此意轉逹駐在國政府、</p>
<h3>麥唐納主合作</h3>
<p>路透二十二日華盛頓電英首相麥唐納在午餐時從全國報界俱樂部發出廣播無線電、略謂美國放棄金本位、已造成甚複雜之時局、然此乃無可奈何之事、無人能任其咎也、各國宜聯合以應付此共同難題、英國並不欲採行報復政策云、午餐後、英首相復往白宮與羅斯福總統繼續談話、</p>
<p>路透二十二日倫敦電英首相麥唐納昨夜抵華盛頓、受極親善之歡迎、其此游之旨趣、已載見於對新聞記者發表之一文中、其言曰、羅斯福總統請余以英國首相兼世界經濟會議主席之資格、來游此邦、而研究吾人所須處理之難題、余接受此請、因余信英美兩國對於世界各大問題、精神一貫、且皆承認目前急務、在銷除吾人現所遭遇之經濟上困苦、吾人必須致力以肅清阻塞吾人國内外商業通衢之障碍、而恢復千萬失業者各得其所之希望、余希望與羅斯福總統對於經濟與政治各問題彼此互換意見、雖在吾人現所有之短時間中、當然未可有成立與他國亦有關係的切實協定之望、然吾人必須開關一致行動之途徑、余信余與美總統之會晤、乃逹此目的之要圖云、</p>
<h3>赫禮歐抵紐約</h3>
<p>路透二十三日紐約電法國前任總理現代表法國參加華盛頓會議之赫禮歐、今日乘法蘭西號抵此、當即向華盛頓進發、</p>
<p>國民二十二日華盛頓電據法蘭西島輪船無線電訊、赫禮歐欲請美國展延停付戰債期、俾渠可以向法國商請補償十二月半到期之戰債云、</p>
<h3>法國政策决定</h3>
<p>路透二十二日巴黎電參加華府預備會議之法代表赫禮歐大致將取消極旁觀者之地位、法國意見以爲美元與英鎊間將有决鬥、而赫禮歐可望作壁上觀、今晨法内閣集議專事討論貨幣情勢、散會後即發訓令致赫禮歐、囑其在華盛頓嚴守中立、一面維持旁觀者之地位、一面須竭力促進世界經濟濟會議之召集、並須作謀取各國恢復金本位而使金融復臻穩固之努力、如談及戰債、赫禮歐有權參加共同繕擬解决一般戰債難題之任何計畫、同時據法方所得之華盛頓情報、英首相麥唐納已允及早討論穩定幣價、並贊同美國所抱戰債修正、僅爲經濟整個問題中一點之見解云、法國之决定維持金本位、已使法國金融界之平穩恢復、金融界中人深信美幣膨脹如不出限制範圍、則法國國内市塲必不致發生恐慌、但衆信當局業已擬定保護程序、如美幣大跌、則此程序即可實施、</p>
<p>路透二十二日紐約電紐約時報預料華盛頓會議之音調中至少有一裂痕、據稱英代表團頗不喜英代表尚在華府時赫禮歐遽即蒞美、蓋英代表團希望英美兩國在法代表抵美以前已獲有諒解、庶可用此同意使法國加入英美業已議定之切實的商業與貨幣同盟云、該報又謂赫禮歐之抵美、或將引起美人之若干仇視、因法國財長今日聲稱、法國决不放棄金本位也云、</p>
<h3>日本重新考慮</h3>
<p>日聯二十三日東京電美總統爲救濟世界經濟之不振狀態召開華盛頓豫備會議、然美國於英法代表在船中未到美以前、忽然實行禁金出口、日外務省認美國此舉爲開動其經濟力而君臨國際外交之决意、加以嚴重警戒、外務省於美國請求派遣代表時以爲其目的在於打開世界經濟困難、故欣然接受其提議、然其後觀美國態度、其召開會議之眞意頗有令人不許樂觀之點、故日政府旣定方針、亦遂不得不改變其根本矣、日政府對於今次華盛頓會議之政治問題、仍將主張日本爲增進遠東和平之擔任者、而在經濟問題則主張如下各項方針（一）金本位之無條件復歸、（二）提高銀價及其安定、（三）一律減低關稅、（四）貫徹通商自由主義、</p>

<p>美國放棄金本位制度之前。現世界尚維持金本制國家。僅有法蘭西德意志瑞士等數國而已。其間惟法德兩國。略具金融資本之指導勢力。而德國自世界大戰終了以還。一苦於賠欵之重負。再迫於關稅壁壘之高築。其國内一般消費能力。逐漸低落。以致産業衰微。貿易不振。至難自救。於是失業者增加。國力愈微弱希特勒雖極勉强掙扎之能事。高倡自給自足之復興運動。究竟能得幾何之實際補益。已不難想見。據常理推斷。最大限亦不過等於對埀危病人。注射强心藥劑已耳。目下尚可勉强撑持者。惟法蘭西一國而已。蓋彼擁有三十二億美金以上之存金。其産業又復略有發逹之餘地。不似德美之産業高度發展。設無海外市塲之開拓。即難於自存者也。然法國前内閣總理赫理歐氏於赴美航行中。驟聞美總統放棄金本制之命令。乃慨歎其整個赴華盛頓會談之計劃。因此推翻。英國亦謂其計劃將發生巨大變化。蓋貿易上之競爭。將愈趨激烈。英國自前年秋季放棄金本位制度。當時美日各國。均尚維持金貨之平價。故能在遠東用銀各國及世界其他國家中。取得英國製品之市塲。及至日本。亦取消金本位制採用通貨膨脹政策。英國對外貿易之利益。即感受若干威脅。美國現在又放棄金本位制。則英國以前所得利益。勢難繼續維持。且將根本動搖矣。於是英美在世界經濟會議之前。華盛頓爐邊談話。暫時之諒解。愈見不易實現。法美爲戰債關係之僵局。恐更難於打開。世界經濟會議之前途。又多一重荆棘難關。</p>
<p>至於美國對日關係。或將因此而更見惡化。遠東貿易市塲之競爭。尤其是對華貿易市塲之爭奪。日美對立。更爲急劇。益以美國停止金本位制度（美金貶低平價。）日美在市塲上競爭。乃愈趨於激烈。不過吾人須知日本産業界基礎。在纖維工業。對我國市塲之傾消，厥爲紡織品。其中尤以棉製品爲最。而美國爲重工業國家。日本且爲其推消原棉及鋼鐵之市塲。故經濟利害之衝突。未必因美國之實行通貨膨脹政策而遂格外加劇也。然日本之兼併東北四省。與現時之壓迫華北。其欲獨占我國市塲。非但足以加强中國民族之積極反抗運動。且更引起美英各國之極度反感。縱令未必惹起流血戰爭。而經濟的爭鬭。勢必更見猛烈。</p>
<p>况當世經濟聯合盛極一時。英國所領導之一羣。旣已形成。先圖大英帝國以内各自治領。殖民地之自給自足。進而以其集體之力。開拓海外市塲。君臨東亞。日本縱橫遠東。席捲我東北四省之後。日日高倡其所謂日滿經濟聯合論。將與英美爭一日之長。美國領導南北美洲繼起。將以全力向海外發展。决無退讓。蘇聯具另一種實力。立於資全主義聯合各羣之間。此皆各自擴張其經濟實力之明顯事實也。然而今日之世界經濟情勢。與一九三一年金本位恐慌當時異趣。（彼時維持金本位之國家尚多。關稅壁壘亦不似今日之高。）故美國今日脫離金本位制。金圓之相對地位。未必較英磅日金更爲低落。英美之間。尚將保持金圓與英磅之相對平衡無論自美國保有（現金）數量上觀察。自國際收支上之收受超過額上觀察。與夫美國在世界經濟上所占地位。及其工業生産品之生産費等觀之。美金圓背後之經濟力。皆處相當高位。是故美國停止金本位後。究竟能收穫幾何利益。實爲難於解决之疑問。其具體解答。儘可俟諸將來之事實。惟目前之經濟的競爭。在英美法日各國之間。以美國放棄金本位制而更趨急劇。乃愈加促進。將來之流血爭戰。我國被侵已久。今且爲衆目所視之惟一標的。環顧四境。又將何以自處。</p>

<h3>齋藤内閣行將改組</h3>
<p>政友會壓迫齋藤總辭職</p>
<p>民政黨始終支持現内閣</p>
<p>齋藤有解散議會之趨向</p>
<p>電通社二十三日東京電因齋藤首相聲明斷行改造内閣、决不總辭職、政局頓呈緊張之狀、今觀目下政局、高橋藏相之挽留旣屬困難、藏相辭職後、有主張起用若槻民政黨總裁以繼之者、亦有謂山本内相將轉任藏相、由若槻總裁繼任内相者、總之齋藤首相必解散議會、使民政黨得乘機奪回被政友會取出之議席、可無疑義、齋藤首相旣有改造内閣向時局邁進之决心、政黨各派遂不得不變更陣容、茲將各黨對此之觀察錄之如下、</p>
<h3>政友會之威脅</h3>
<p>齋藤首相雖聲明不總辭職、然首相之意如何、殊難斷言、負輔弼之責者、斷不能預先明言辭職日期、我等確信高橋藏相辭職後、内閣必總辭職、若藉改造延長壽命、則政友閣員必連袂辭職、結局改造不能、勢必出於總辭職之一途、下届内閣必屬我黨、蓋我黨擁有三百名之絶對多數、事實上不能蔑視也云云、</p>
<h3>民政黨之護擁</h3>
<p>松田幹事長二十一日會見山本内相時、内相曾言（高橋藏相雖辭職補充、後維者已足、）與首相之言、可謂一致、亦可見首相决心之堅、我黨始終支持現内閣、即元老重臣方面亦希望現内閣之存續、無論政友會如何策動、决不致總辭職、萬一高橋藏相辭職、擬向黨閣員進言、必改造内閣、解散議會、向時局邁進、</p>
<h3>貴族院之觀測</h3>
<p>内外情勢益趨重大、齋藤内閣之使命、尚未完畢、故高橋藏相雖藉病辭職、不能爲總辭職之理由、可以補充了之、惟政友會對改造内閣、是否應允、殊爲疑問、首相雖有改造之意、結果或歸失敗而總辭職、後繼内閣須俟總辭職時、視政友會之處置與五一五事件發表之影響如何、或爲政友會内閣或再降大命於齋藤首相、或降大命於其他之惑星、須至届時方定、</p>
<h3>齋藤方面表示</h3>
<p>電通社二十三日東京電齋藤首相曾聲明、雖高橋藏相辭職、亦當改造内閣擔任時局、惟閣員中之鳩山文相、對於首相之改造意見、久經表明反對、并揚言政友系閣員之退出、與齋藤内閣絶緣、如是則齋藤内閣、將一反舉國一致之組閣精神、首相左右對於此點、談話如下、政友系閣員設退出内閣、或可謂爲失去舉國的意義、然此爲枝葉問題、而能否擔任非常時時局、方爲根本問題、若後任内閣、係一强有力内閣、則爲另一問題、若鈴木内閣、宇垣内閣、與平治内閣等、皆不能實現時、齋藤内閣雖與政友會絶緣、若由一大决心以善處之、則此處實有存續之意義也云、</p>

<p>美國禁金出口日棉布輸出亦受打撃</p>
<p>增錠計劃挫折日紗每月過剩四萬梱</p>
<p>電通二十三日東京電紡織會社之增錠計畫、自去年來甚爲流行、四月一日現在之錠子實比去年末增加十五萬六千八百四十枚、而本年中之增加錠數預定約六十萬、因突然取消日印通商條約、懸念於其後之高率關稅、且自美國禁金輸出後、匯兌昂貴、致懸念於棉布輸出之不暢、增錠計劃乃蒙頓挫、去年内運往印度之布疋、計六十四萬四千碼、若依棉紗計算則爲四十一萬梱、此外消費於棉織品等者四萬綑、如是合計爲四十五萬梱、此爲運向印度之生産量也、若與去年度棉紗生産額二百八十萬梱相比較、則爲一成七分、又印度若課高率關稅而停止輸出、則每月約有四萬梱紗之過剩、即以半數二萬綑計算、亦有調節該數生産額之必要、又印度以外之輸出亦因匯兌之昂貴難望轉佳、故七月以後之減工率、難免爲某種程度之擴張也、</p>
<h3>英俄排貨影響</h3>
<p>路透社廿二日莫斯科電蘇俄外交委員李維諾夫今日對路透社電發表談話、大旨謂英國禁止俄貨入口、結局徒自損失、蘇俄貿易政策、對於進口貨極有伸縮能力伸則可使外國貿易極度膨脹、縮則外貨絶跡、而無損於蘇我之建設、他國苟欲强令蘇俄減少進口貨、則實自取損失耳、因外貨入俄之減少、將使世界一般經濟恐慌愈爲增甚也、蘇俄在最近將來中能使世界某種金屬物之存底減少十分之三四至十分之十云、</p>
<p>路透社二十二日莫斯科電英國禁俄貨入口、蘇俄乃施報復政策、亦禁英貨入口、據消息靈通者之意見、蘇俄此舉、有兩種趨勢、一爲外交作用、借此掩護以赦免現被拘禁之二英人、一爲英俄絶交之先聲、並爲向他國表示蘇俄堅强之姿勢、雖兩國現有之緊張、不即寛弛、則時局前途殊難逆料、惟就目前事態觀之、外交關係不致遽行决裂、查俄國對英貿易、處於出超地位、逹二千五百萬鎊之多、此爲蘇俄應付外債之最有價値的資産、此種出超、欲求之於他國、目前殆不可能、此乃蘇俄不欲遽與英國絶交之最大原因也、</p>
<p>路透二十三日倫敦電維克公司在俄技師孟克賀斯等四人今晨九時抵物利浦街車站、在月台歡迎者甚衆、孟等下車後、歡聲大作、繼則全體肅立、齋唱國歌、維克公司總理波爾與回國諸職員一一握手、孟等安然返國、與家人相聚、固覺欣快、然一念及同事桑頓與麥克唐諾之置身囹圄、巇愀然以悲、孟等在抵倫敦會商以前、對於俄國審訊情形、槪不置詞、</p>
<p>路透二十二日倫敦電路透社從官塲方面探悉、俄貨進口禁令下如遇有眞正困難情事、亦可給予特殊之進口執照、但以俄貨較他國來貨價賤爲理由者、則不能准給執照、凡禁令前所定購之俄貨、而未能及早繳出者、及將發生失業困難者、乃爲當道所可攷慮之特殊事件、商部大臣任錫曼定星期一日返倫敦研究此事、</p>
<p>路透二十三日倫敦電蘇俄商業代表團領袖沃塞斯基及團員二人今晨由維多利亞車站乘車離英、前往莫斯科、駐英俄大使到站送行、查英俄商約四月十七日期滿、英國禁止俄貨輸入、蘇俄對外貿易委員乃召駐英商業代表團返國商榷、故俄代表團現起程返國、所有在英職務暫時停頓、</p>
<h3>美參院拖延膨脹通貨案</h3>
<p>否决農村救濟會</p>
<p>國民二十二日華盛頓電今日美參院對於政府膨脹通貨法案、除議員間彼此詆毁外、僅屬拖延時日、似無亟欲通過之象、據多數黨議場領袖羅賓生言、或將須至下星期三方能通過於參院、至衆院中則前財長梅隆與米爾士俱爲議員攻撃之的、衆議員藍金憤兩人之出入於議員休息室、斥爲公衆之敵、謂經濟之衰落、兩人之政策當負大部份責任、惟兩人雖活動甚力、即共和黨領袖亦認欲阻通貨之膨脹、已屬無望、預料參院將以二對一之票數通過此案、頃調查參議員態度、似大多數贊成授予總統决定應否鑄造銀幣之權、倘總統下令開鑄、則並將規定金銀之比價云、</p>
<p>路透二十二日華盛頓電參議院今日以四四對二五票否决再撥農村抵押經費之建議、按再撥農村抵押費二十萬萬元議案、曾由參議院正式贊成作爲農村救濟案之一部分、本月初已由衆院通過、</p>

<p>財政部發給執照輸運出口是、此間現信美國所傅出之消息、乃由加拿大近實行加拿大金券律修正文而起、該修正文使總督有權暫止償付加拿大之金券、</p>
<p>路透二十二日温尼巴電因外間謠傅加拿大將加緊限制金出口之故、此間麥市價每布施爾陡漲三分又八分之三至三分又八分之七、投機家紛紛購入、芝加哥遠期小麥價初跌約一分、收盤漲高二分左右、</p>

<h3>死一般的張垣</h3>
<p>本報特派員國安</p>
<p>牛步似的慢車、於下午八時一刻、總算爬到了張垣、經過了風沙的包圍、以及乘客們咀咒的雰圍、在燈火四射的當兒、列車喘吁吁的停在車站上、又嘈雜擾嚷了半天、我糢糊地走上充滿了塵土的街道、鑽進了旅館、於是一枕橫陳、酣入睡鄉、等到太陽爬出來到很高時、我才一覺醒來、這様一來、整個的張家口、在羣山環抱中映入眼廉、不整齊的土街道、和那高大的駱駝、表現着口外的特有的景色、雖然着紅掛綠的蒙古人、在這荒漠的塞上、到處都看得見、但是讀者們、你們能想像</p>

<p>張家口的土城分爲上下、當地人稱爲上堡下堡、察哈爾省政府設在上堡裏面、高大的磚城、繞着窄窄的小巷、兩輪的大車和人力車、常常在小巷裏糾纒呌駡着、青河在車站和土堡的當中流過、上有二橋、一個呌青河橋、建於民國十四年、張之江題的字、東邊那是個比較小的橋、現在河裏没水、沙石在滾着、以先有三個京劇院、此刻都　門大吉、娼妓照様也潛伏在小土院裏、姑蘇班也還佔勢力、怡安街是最繁華的一條、照像館有兩家之多、這地方死人還算講究、娶媳婦更是熱閙、新娘子還穿着鳳冠霞帔、居然和戲臺上差不多、老百姓都是表現着忍苦耐勞的精神、東面山麓底下、有馮玉祥時建築的大營房、現在據說是没人住、我也没到那去瞧、標語口號、到處都是、琳琅滿目、大多是以漢蒙團結抗日爲中心、蒙古字的標語也不少、</p>
<p>在市鎭的西北角上、有一個賜兒山、據說明時某大人到山上廟裏求兒、一下就着了、故名賜兒山和寺、裏面有兩個冰泉、這時還結着大塊的冰、水清而冽我在廟裏、就吃到那泉水煮的茶、山上的亭閣墻壁上、都是游人留的大名和大作、除外還有反對基督教的口號和咒駡東北軍人的粉筆字的標語、我立在最高的山頭上、放眼四矚、張垣全鎭在望、但是張垣的空氣、死一般的寂靜、在上午不可多得的清明天氣、越發像墳墓一般的靜、</p>
<p>東北和西北山上的長城、黃色的土城墻、很無力地起伏着、圓圓的烽火臺、也失去了昔日的威嚴、只有現實的劉主席所構築的防空陣地、替代了他的責任、然而這死一般的張垣、屏列羣山、險自天成、扼西北的交通、關乎戰略上的得失很大、國人們注意着這個門户吧、</p>

<p>中央對於新疆事變、異常重視、蓋以新省面積之大、物産之富、及未來之中國國民經濟人口問題上、佔有極重要之地位、且該省毘連印俄、與外交上亦極有關係、是以中央自接得該省事變消息後、即籌商解决辦法、刻已决定調查實際情形、同時並遴派大員前往解决、俾該糾紛勿再擴大、至中央所派大員人選、刻正由行政院會同軍事委員會選派中、至遲在下星期中即可選定、</p>
<h3>嚴令抵抗</h3>
<p>近日前方戰事、依然嚴重、中央現已電令駐前線各軍、無論如何、務須誓死抵抗到底、總之敵人步步進逼、我國處此危急之時、除上下一致抵抗外、别無生路可言、至蔣委員長何日離贛北上、刻尚未有確訊、</p>
<h3>川軍抗日</h3>

<h3>實部謀交涉</h3>
<p>實業部以公共租界工部局攫奪工廠檢查權、實屬破壤我國整個勞工行政、爲明瞭該案眞相、以便進行交涉、特派勞工司長包華國來滬、從事調查並與市府當局協議方針、據悉交涉方法、分爲兩步、第一步先由市府直接向工部局進行交涉、如果不能獲得圓澫解决、則第二步將咨請外交部、根據法律事實、提出嚴重抗議、</p>
<h3>總工會宣言</h3>
<p>自機械工業發逹以後、工廠内之種種安全設備、遂成爲一重要之問題、故歐美諸先進國、均有特種法律、以保護工人生命之安全、我國在前北洋軍閥時代、雖有類此之法令頒布、但均未見實施、故各工廠之設備、大都因陋就簡、草率從事、工人哀宛工作於機聲軋軋之下、其危險有非可想像者、自國民政府成立後、對於勞工福利、力加注意、曾先後頒佈工廠法、及工廠檢查法、以謀勞工生活之改善、最近實業部並舉辦工廠檢查人員養成所、訓練此項人才、並經派赴各地實施檢查、本市華界方面、業已完成初步檢查工作、而特區工廠、則因工部局百般阻撓、仍未克實行、本會前已宣言反對、乃租界當局、變本加厲、竟在本届納稅西人會、提出修改洋涇浜章程附則第三十四條、希圖喧賓奪主、攫取我工廠檢查權、於法於情、均屬毫無根據、查租界爲我國領土、我政府自有獨立之法治精神、界内之華商工廠、自應受本國法令之拘束、且界内之納稅華人佔百分之九十五以上、界内一切設施、尤應服從大多數之意見、今以極少數之納稅西人、而擅自修改地皮章程、其爲違法、自不待言、本會爲擁護國家法權、保障勞工利益計、對工部局此種越爼代謀破壞我國行政權之不法行爲、願竭全力、堅决反對、甚望政府以不屈不撓之精神、繼續進行也、謹此宣言、</p>

<h3>華商紗廠昨日繼續减工</h3>
<p>現正與銀錢界商辦法救濟</p>
<p>先謀傾銷存貨再力圖恢復</p>
<p>全國華商紗廠聯合會議决减工辦法後、全國華商、除天津因灤戰緊張暫緩實行、餘均遵照實行、吳市長曾電請汪院長在京召集關係各部會議、紗廠聯合會及市府、均派代表晋京、鐵道部派業務司長來滬、定今日召集絲紗各業協商救濟辦法、茲誌各情如下、</p>
<h3>繼續停工</h3>
<p>本市華商紗廠申新·恒豐·等遵照聯合會議决案、於前日起、實行减工後、均採用每星期六星期日日夜班停工辦法、昨爲星期日、各紗廠均停止工作、紗廠聯合會臨時推出之監察委員薛春生·李升伯·黃旨民等三人、昨晨仍分赴各廠視察、</p>
<h3>會商救濟</h3>
<p>華商紗廠聯合會議决减工、以减生産、業於二十二日起實行、全國華商紗廠一致停工、中央黨部及實業部特派專員來滬、協商救濟辦法、經市府召集兩次會議、由吳市長决定、電行政院請汪院長、於二十五日晨、召集實業財政鐵道及有關係各部長集議、上海市政府亦派員入京與議、茲聞紗廠方面、業於紗廠聯合會之常年大會中、推派榮宗敬·聶潞生·郭順·張則民·四人赴京云、</p>
<h3>聶潞生談</h3>
<p>中央社云、全國紗廠聯合會、爲外貨傾銷、營業衰落、决定暫行减工、藉資維持、再派代表晋京、籲請救濟、以免崩潰、記者今晨往寗波路恒豐紗廠、晤聶潞生君詳詢此事之起因、及對政府之希望、承一一答覆、茲分錄於後、</p>
<h3>投資數額</h3>
<p>全國紗廠共有八十二家、有紗錠二百五十萬錠、每錠設置費約四十元、共計一千萬元、其他如廠房建築約五百萬元、工人有十七萬人、月出紗線一百餘萬包、此項工業、雖尚在萌芽之際、但在工商落後之中國、其經濟地位、實不可小視、</p>
<h3>慘澹歷史</h3>
<p>吾國紗布工業之歷史、雖甚短促、惟其經歷則甚慘澹、自一九一九年歐戰告終後、十年以來、歐美各國、咸受經濟不景氣之影響、雖得政府之資助獎掖、尚不免於停工倒閉、此在最近數年間、尤所習聞、而吾國之廠家、則絶不爲國人所注意、亦不得政府之協助、以前之能苟延殘喘、於此風雨飄搖之中者、益以不景氣之潮流、尚未波及太平洋之西岸耳、惟其經過之慘苦、有非國人所能逆料者、當民十四年五卅慘案發生後、租界電廠停止給電、各廠不得已停工、民十六年工人運動勃興、亦時因集會而停工、各廠家雖經此困苦、但仍勉力維持、</p>
<h3>外貨傾銷</h3>
<p>國廠之艱難危急、旣如上述、而此次竟决定减工、實因有不得已之苦衷、各國商家、因受不景氣之影響、均由政府援助、實行傾銷、尤以日本爲最甚、其在印度美國之市塲、已得絶大之勢力、在吾國之市塲、其勢力則更雄厚、惜國人尚不知其來勢之兇猛也、惟小部份之减工、尚係青天之鳥雲、國人如尚未知暴風雨之將來、預爲防範、則及其來時、恐將不及趨避矣、</p>
<h3>先行减工</h3>
<p>全國减去夜工、約及全數百分之二十餘、但以成本計算、則反增百分之三十、蓋出産減少、而一切開支、尚不能節省、所以如此者、一方希望能激剌各地商家、定購存貨、藉資流通、一方亦所以表示危機之在醖釀而爆發、此减工議案將試行二週、再行召會商討、但政府如無整個方案、恐亦不能稍蘇困况也、</p>
<h2>Page 9</h2>
<h3>希望援助</h3>
<p>各國工商之能向外侵略、均有經濟之援助、政府之後盾、其利害較軍事侵略爲尤甚、國廠廠主、在此經濟戰爭之前線、抵禦侵略、自須有雄厚之後援、但政府旣不注意、國人亦均隔膜、孤軍苦戰、何能克敵致果、且僅對紗布一業、加以獎助、亦不能渡此難關、尚望政府對於全國實業、决定整個策略、以增厚工商之抵抗力云、</p>
<h3>俞棪談話</h3>
<p>鐵道部長顧孟餘氏、以此次我國紗廠减工、由於華紗生産過剩、銷路不暢、於鐵路運輸調劑之旨、不無重要關係、昨特派該部業務司長俞棪來滬、召集絲紗各業會商救濟辦法、俞司長定今日下午四時、在華安大樓、約請絲紗各業、討論救濟方針、聞俞司長談鐵道部對於華紗運價、原有優待辦法、係按普通運價計算收費、本已示提倡華紗之旨、此次因全國紗廠實行减工、其原因由於紗銷不廣、生産過剩、新貨出路、更無把握、致全國紗業、岌岌可危、鐵道負運輸調劑重要責任、勢不能膜視、坐令國紗破産、故顧部長特派來滬、召集各絲紗商人、爲進一步之協商、希望能對於運價上得一適當之緊急救濟辦法、不過關稅政策、爲維持國産事業之第一門户、財部當局、聞已擬切實維持辦法、在政府方面、對此嚴重之事勢、自必一致合力進行、以圖挽救云</p>

<h3>俞棪講詞</h3>
<p>今天、敝部招待上海鑛業鋼鐵五金建築機器電氣捲烟絲綢棉織剌繡地毯油漆及其他各行同業、承諸君光臨、異常榮幸、敝部此次在上海開展覽會的意義、諸君大槪都已明白、全國鐵路沿線出産、諸君今天參觀以後、大槪也非常明瞭、農工商業與鐵路有重大的關係、在今天會裹面、也可以看出一點、無論那一個國家的貨物、從生産到銷費、中間需要有一種聯絡、這種聯絡、就是鐵道和其他水道公路的運輸、所有生産消費兩方面、能夠調劑平均、及需要與供給能夠維持平衡、全靠運輸上之能否盡其責任、因爲鐵路與生産銷費的關係、異常重要、所以這一次敝部把所有生産的情形、盡量搜羅、供給各行商參觀、在鐵路方面、希望將所有全國産銷的數量、運輸的方法、運費的多寡、能够陳列出來、給各行商參考、作以後營業的方針、這是敝部開鐵道沿線貨展的意思、今天承諸君光臨、不能不把這個意思講明、同時稍爲講一點農工商界與鐵路合作之必要、鐵路是國營的事業、而同時也負擔推進全國農工商各業的責任、所以鐵路不一定會普通營業的方針、作爲鐵路經營的標準、而須以發展各業爲前提、不過在現在經濟狀况之下、工商各業、在中國還未有進步、尚未脫離十八世紀以前的狀况、所以想改進農工商業、而改進農工商各業、必要與鐵路合作、而他們自已、亦必要分工合作、假如一種農業、他要推廣他的生産能力、和銷費的數量、第一、就是要鐵路設法廉價運輸、否則就不能把大量的農産品、運銷出來、所以就這一點、可以知道鐵路與農業關係之重大、其次說到工業、工廠需要原料、也需要動力、就是機械燃料、如果末有動力、就不能發展工業、並且工業品造成之後、要推銷到廣大的市塲上去、如果鐵路對於工業的原料動力、和已成的工業品、不能想法子輔助工業、就不容易發展、至於商人方面、也不過是從價錢頂便宜的出産地購買了以後、運到最大的市塲、和價錢較高的地方、去供消費者之用、但是一定要經過運輸的手續、所以也得需要與鐵路合作、從以上的各點看起來、無論農工商各業、都有與鐵路合作的必要、假如鐵路不能盡其責任、結果就是各業不發逹、現在舉一個例說、近來全國的經濟落後、農村破産、而商人資本又很少、當然不能把貨物推銷到外國去、因此每年全國進口的貨物、比出口大數倍、這種情形、政府當局、也很感覺到、所以很想方法來維持、比方說棉紗、每年進口七千二百餘萬元、出口祇有三千餘萬、相差四千二百餘萬元、結果棉紗業就不能維持、鐵道部也想到這種情形、很想使鐵路運輸來帮助他們、維持他們、所以就這一點、就可以知道棉紗業與鐵路合作之需要、至剛才所說的是農工商各業與鐵路合作的前題、其最扼要之點、則爲農工商業之分工合作、必先要有各種事業自已的合作、那麽各業才能發展、才能够减輕成本、增加營業的把握、譬如、（一）農的方面、先要自已辦生産合作、信用合作、農産品販賣合作、（二）工的方面、亦先要辦原料品合作、動力供給合作、及製造品銷售合作、（三）商的方面、亦要辦購買合作販賣合作等等、然後再與鐵路合作、自能設法减輕運價結果、當然營業發逹、所以從這幾方面看、我們知道、在銷費上應當有消費合作、在生産上應當有生産合作、同時卽應一切的一切、都與鐵路合作、今天鄙人很簡略的、與諸君講一講、至於路商合作之利益、與方法、請譚博士沛霖、購演鐵路負責聯運、對於工商界之利益、請劉碩士傅書講演、</p>
<h3>劉傅書講演</h3>

<h3>讀者顧問</h3>
<p>關於（農村裏回得去嗎）問題討論函件一束（十五）本埠朱天青君來信答劉思民先生質問十七日在讀者顧問欄内見了劉思民先生的來信。洋洋一大篇。最初我以爲劉先生又有高明的意見發表了。所以不惜光陰從頭至尾很仔細地看了一遍。詎料讀完之後。使我感覺到無限的失望。原來劉先生空佔讀者顧問的篇幅。對於（農村裏回得去嗎）的問題。毫無新鮮的意見發表。僅僅對於我和尤先生加以質問而已。旣然劉先生對於我有所質問。那麽我也不得不按照來信。加以解答。</p>
<p>（一）中國農民的痛苦。最重要的。的確是由於他們的没有智識。他們的所以没有智識。很顯明的自然由於農村教育的不發逹。尤先生的見解如此。我的見解和他相彷彿。至於中國農村教育所以不發逹。情形當然很是複雜。政治的不上軌道。軍閥的内訌。共匪的到處擾亂。外國資本主義勢力的侵入。以及苛捐雜稅等等。這些頻頻使農村受到極大的打撃。而使農民和農村陷於破産的境地。差不多一般貧苦的農民。自顧無暇。安能顧及農村教育。這就是農村教育不發逹的原因。辦教育尤以農村教育是一椿無利可圖的事業。非眼光深遠。下有决心者莫能辦。中國的農村雖是破産。可是苦的是一般的佃户。一般的大地主仍舊資財萬貫。在家享福。照理這般大地主。儘可仗義輸財。拿出錢來。以辦農村教育。可是中國是一個個人主義發逹的國家。上至官吏，下至庶民。祗知唯利是圖。（假使不榨取。那可算一個絶頂的好人）。自顧不及。更無暇顧及辦理農村教育。所以你看農村破産儘管破産。但是儘有些人。携帶巨欵。到繁華都市裹去享樂。至於久居都市裏的大家富户。他們終日醉生夢死。更是樂不思蜀。要呌他們去辦理農村教育。猶之難如豋天。譬如像最近的葉鴻英先生獨出鉅欵。專辦鄉村教育的能有幾人。處於這種狀况之下。試問中國的農村教育還會發逹嗎。農村破産後。是否農村裏的人應該跑到都市裏去嗎。農村破産後。都市裏的人是否回不得農村嗎。假若農村破産後。農村裏的人儘可跑到都市裏找生活。那我可以大膽地說。都市裏非但欲感到人口過剩的危險。就是農村也要每况愈下。外國資本主義。更能乘𨻶而入。那時候的農村。勢必一敗塗地，至於不可收拾。而舊式的封建制度也休想活。那我剷除。至於一般到都市裏去找生活的人。因爲都市裏感到人口過剩。生活程度增加的緣故。勢必流落異鄉。那是毫無疑義的。所以我的主張農村無論怎様破産。農村裏的人。終不應該離農村而到都市。因爲在農村裏過生活。終究比都市裏要容易得多。至於都市裏的人。農村雖然破産。我以爲有回到農村裏去底可能。因爲生活程度。比都市裏要低得多哩！再講都市。就拿上海來作　喻。上海一隅竟屬有限。人口呢反而一天一天的在增加。於是就感覺到人口的過剩。至於人才輩出。而收容的機關竟屬有限。於是供多於求。失業的一天一天的增加。假使失業者仍舊逗留在上海。那麽一年二年······的等下去。甚至十年的等下去。恐怕永遠不能謀得插足地。而失業問題當然不能解决。因爲失業問題的難於解决。所以我和尤懹臯先生主張勸雄聲君回到農村裏去。一來</p>

<p>便於解决生活。二來可以盡雄聲君的力。致力於開拓農村教育。我所以主張開拓農村教育。因爲感覺得中國目前農村教育的需要。將來中國民主政治的是否能逹到完善境地。那全視人民的智識程度如何。換一句話說。教育是否發逹。農村教育當然佔最重要的地位。雖然雄聲的能力有限。不能靠着他一人而能開拓全國農村教育但是假使雄聲君把農村教育辦得奸的說話。那麽有了雄聽君的模範。我相信繼雄聲而後者必有其人。因爲劉思民先生的質問。所以把農村教育所以不發逹的原因合我的主張。併述如上。（二）（尤先生勸人到鄉村裏去。完全是個人主義的落伍思想。不但落伍朱先生。我說這話你暫且不要氣）。這幾句話。我覺得劉先生，未免失之檢點。（朱先生，我說這話你暫且不要氣）。試問（氣）從何來。這是什麽話。假若，劉先生。你有良好的意見發表我自應洗耳靜聽。可是不幸得很。你並没有良好的意見貢獻給閱者諸君和我。同時我發覺你賣弄文字專氣人耳（尤先生勸人到鄉村裏去。完全是個人主義的落伍思想。劉先生。這話未免過於武斷吧。請問尤先生勸人到鄉村裹去。目的如何。是否呌人到鄉村裏去安逸。尤先生勸人到鄉村裏去的出發點是什麽。出發點没有辨清。遑加批評。我說你滑稽。你眞滑稽，（國難）（國難）喊得震天價響。假使不務實際工作。那有什麽用處。劉先生你大聲族呼。暴日有因之而退步嗎。（現在仍在交戰中。若果有心肝的人。都應當積極地先在都市中鼓勵抗日情緒。組織起來。然後從城市推到鄉村。組織民衆抗日救國會與救國團體。教農民知道我們只有拿起武器來先把（臨頭）的（國難）卽侵入腹地的敵人驅逐出去。這幾句話劉先生。是你說的嗎！唷！在字面上看來。倒是很冠冕堂皇的。可是這種辦法。是否能够得到美滿的結果麽。呀！劉先生。我想未必吧。我來告訴你。前年當瀋陽事變後。海上的學生大學生，中學生，小學生，男的，女的，他們充滿了滿腔的熱血。大聲疾呼的到鄉下去宣傅。滿希望喚起農民的愛國。可是結果呢。不是等於零麽。這是什麽緣故呢。對於這點我想你還未觀透。我來告訴你。劉先生！這就是農村教育不發逹的緣故。因爲農村教育不發逹的緣故。所以一般的農民。對於（國家興亡匹夫有責）的意義。根本上不能瞭解。所以在農村教育没有發逹之先。要想憑着宣傅的力量。（教農民知道我們只有拿起武器來先把（臨頭）的（國難）驅逐出去。那是一件吃力不討好的東西。事實是辦不到的。所以要想（從城市推到鄉村）說起來很便當的。但是談何容易。我和尤先生勸雄聲君到鄉村裏去。並不是說値茲國難臨頭勸雄聲君逃之夭夭。溜之大吉。我們勸雄聲君回到鄉村裏去。消極方面說起來。還是教雄聲君救國。因爲我們勸雄聲君回到鄉村裏去的主要目的。就是教他開拓農村教育。而目前的中國惟有農村教育可以挽救。雖然農村教育的成效很遲緩。可是牠的效果是很大的。我知道劉先生是絶對不主張雄聲君回到農村裏去的。因爲雄聲君在都市裏可以積極的鼓起抗日情緒。不過。雄聲君自已生活還未安穩。試問教他怎様起來救國。劉先生。我倒要請教你哩！</p>
<p>（三）建設新式桃花源的出發點。就是想開拓農村教育。所以要開拓農村教育。就是要使人民洞逹國家大事爲最高目的）。這幾句話。誠然。是我說的。但是我自已覺得意思。很連貫。因爲開拓農村教育之後。農民才能識字。識了字才能閱讀報章雜誌。能够閱讀報章之後。自然能洞逹國家大事。至少不致茫然不知。什麽你把詞句竟分析成（建設新式桃花源）（使人民知道國家大事。）並且說（建設新式桃花源）與（使人民知道國家大事）結起婚來。喂！劉先生你讀過修辭學麽。什麽連分析詞句都分不來。我們有些替你慚愧。假令農村教育不發逹。人民是否能洞逹國家大事。我　又要請教劉先生了。</p>

<h3>華東勝華西紀</h3>
<p>結果十一比零</p>
<p>（漢口特信）全國分區足球賽、二十二日爲舉行决賽第二日、係夙負盛名之華東隊、對華西隊作戰、上半時、西隊卽有守無攻、漸至守亦不可、華東遂以三比零獲捷、下半時西隊氣　勢蹙、連被東隊攻進八球、華東以八比零再勝、綜合爲十一比零、華西慘敗、用詳紀戰况如下、</p>
<h3>華東隊</h3>

<h3>華西隊</h3>

<h3>觀戰者萬頭攢動</h3>
<p>武漢人士、耳滬上球將之名已久、咸思一觀絶技、是日天氣晴明、春風　漾、又適爲星期六、故入塲觀戰者萬頭攢動、球塲四週、及看台上、均告人滿、後來者無地插足、多椽木而觀、綠樹叢中、楊柳枝上、遂爲臨時之看台、武漢人士之球迷、可見一斑、要亦華東大名、有以傾動之也、</p>
<h3>兩罰球西隊受挫</h3>
<p>二時十分、戰幕初啟、東吳戰將、奮勇爭先、如疾風暴雨、以致戰不多時、西隊即罰角球三次、手球一次、又以後衛兩度於球門近處、以手代足、兩罰十二碼球、第一由顧尚勤主罰、發球略高、致掠門頂而過、第二次由羅海光主罰、羅原有長脚仙之譽、力壯足穩、球如疾矢、自球門右角低飛落網、遂首開勝利紀錄、而西隊負一球矣、</p>
<h3>小黑炭攻球未中</h3>
<p>又戰十餘分鐘、東隊以前鋒動作之敏捷傅、球之準確、屢逼西陣西隊守將、尚能應付、惟屢被罰角球、東隊中之羅海光陳洪光陳鎭和、常環伺門側、俟角球發來、卽以頭直承、頂向門内、但均未命中、小黑炭盤球極佳、進攻似覺尚未十分賣力、數次攻球、均失之過高、觀者咸惋惜不置、</p>

<h3>長脚仙二次奏捷</h3>
<p>相持又約二十分鐘、曹秋亭·羅海光·自左側陣地、共逐一球、以極迅捷之短傅、直衝西隊門旁、被羅再攻入一球、遂二次奏捷、未幾陳洪光單槍匹馬深入西陣、以頭頂一球入網、至此已届上半局告終之時、西隊反攻無效、卒以三與零之比、結束上半時戰局、雙方罰球次數、西隊罰角球十二次、十二碼球二次、犯規一次、東隊罰手球二次、犯規一次、</p>
<h3>下半時易地再戰</h3>
<p>下半時、雙方互易陣地、華東陣綫略有變更、鍾勇森加入前鋒、接替陳光耀、尤爲奮勇、是時西隊雖尚酣呼奮戰、而氣已漸餒、前後亦漸失聯絡、未五分鐘、即被鍾勇森攻進一球、其後數次攻球近門、均爲西隊守將救出、</p>
<h3>五分鐘連勝三球</h3>
<p>華西隊屢敗之後、漸不能支、華東愈戰愈猛、五分鐘内、東隊曹秋亭、羅海光鍾勇森、各攻進一球、西隊不能　　、幾如拉朽摧枯、不久西隊振刷精神、努力攻取、被張蜀樵向東陣攻進一球、以越位宣告無效、華西至此、遂不能復振矣、</p>
<h3>鍾羅萬餘勇可賈</h3>
<p>是時戰事將告結束、華西隊全取守勢、觀者以爲東隊自此當難得手、不謂華東健兒、餘勇可賈、鍾勇森羅海光、繼續攻進二球、萬象華復於最後獨力攻進兩球、遂定下半時以八對零之局、雙方罰球次數、亞隊罰角球四、東隊罰角球手球各一、</p>
<h3>雙方戰將之比較</h3>
<p>華東以十一對零、戰勝華西後、卽高唱得勝之歌、觀者亦嘖嘖稱道、總觀整個戰局、華東隊之技術、實足驚人、如萬象華鍾勇森、羅海光之善於衝突、陳鎭和之巧於傅遞、李寗顧尚勤之善於招架、以及徐亨之善於守門、均有妙不可言之處、誠哉名下無虚也、惟華西隊雖遭慘敗、戰將亦多有可取、如童顯裕雲重慶張蜀樵、均能力戰到底、態度安閑、守將曹光祖、尤善於搶險、曾救出七險球、均爲常人所不及防者、否則將成十八與零之比、更一敗塗地矣、</p>

<h3>中華足球會青華撃敗育青</h3>
<p>結果五與一之比</p>
<p>青華足球隊頗有奪取此番中華足球會中字組錦標之希望、該隊昨與育青隊作中字組比賽於棒球塲、因氣候温暖、觀者不少、青華人材平均、攻守均宜、青青抵敵不住、以一比五敗於青華、三時開賽、彼此逐鹿、育青門前、危險頗多、幸保守得法、暫以勾安、二十五分鐘時、青華王伯勇攻入育青一球、首開紀錄、往來育青後衛翁可法動作失檢、踢傷青華王伯勇、被裁判員取消比賽資格、育青後方、乃更覺虚弱、連被青華周光祖罰進十二碼球並攻入一只、育青興師反攻、前鋒尚稱聯絡、由黃國榮在人叢中攻入青華一球、上半時成三比一、</p>
<p>再戰聲中、育青反攻極力、無奈不得其門而入、青華乘勝進攻、銳氣旺盛、雙方競爭、益見劇烈、在最後十分鐘内、青華寥世明周光祖又連得兩球、遂以五比一之結果、</p>

<h3>上海人的哲學</h3>
<p>— 百合</p>
<p>國難如此，雖然是說不點頭的頑石，雖然鼻涕眼涙不至於一把一把的淌出來，至少，總也不能不有五分鐘的嘆息。但（國家事，用不到，爾等勞心），國家大事，政府已有（整個計劃），老百姓（如喪考妣），簡眞是多此一舉。（天坍自有長人頂），還是讓洒家來（在滬言滬，）談談上海的本地風光。</p>
<p>上海眞是樂土。上海一天繁榮似一天。</p>
<p>美國是黃金國，然而在（最近的已往），大銀行，小銀行，一律鐵將軍守門。惟有上海的銀行，去年一年中。没一家不賺得（麥克麥克）。而且在（最近的已往），新銀行又開出了好幾家。</p>
<p>世界各國，儘閙着不景氣，（貨棄於地），無人過問。可是在上海，却適得其反。大公司裏，每天人山人海，擠得（水洩不通），特别大廉價時，（水洩不通）還不足形容其擠，簡直是（呼吸不便）。就是馬路旁的（五香花生米）攤子，也没一個不是生涯鼎盛。</p>
<p>日本雖是東方第一大國，然而建築物，都矮小得如鷄塒，怎及得我們上海的大洋房，七層，八層，十七層，十八層，高得活像天文台。聽說在滬西現在正在構築一座三十三層樓的大洋房，或許在（不久的將來），還會有高出於三十三層之外的。</p>
<p>每一弄口的花柳醫生廣告，往往會裱糊得一寸多厚，這就够證明上海的（肉）的發逹。這一類神秘（肉）的交易，據經濟學家說，與商業，金融，有極大的關係。在作者住的那個陋巷裹，新近也開張了一家（肉的交易所），因此，洒家就知道上海的繁榮，正（方興未艾），（日進無疆）。</p>
<p>（上海的繁榮，上海人之福也）。這是上海人的哲學。</p>
<h3>亡國以後</h3>
<p>— 阿絜</p>
<p>我們貴國的官僚富翁，因爲養尊處優，頣指氣使得慣了；美人，汽車，酒池，肉林，也有些厭了：心想換換口味，長長見識，所以都盼望國家的速亡，以便在本人還没有（鳴呼哀哉）之前，嘗嘗做（亡國奴）的滋味！</p>
<p>熊希齡先生說：（北方的農民，很曉得愛國，把自已家裹的車輛，牛馬都送到前線去。ＸＸ一個小縣，能夠拿出一百多萬的金錢，來給前線將士做軍費。）我想南中人士，畢竟比北人來得聰明；試看現在來出愛國捐的人，都是無産階級；所以報上的報告，找不出一位千元萬元的捐户，難道這個中國，全屬於這班窮朋友嗎？難道大老官有的是錢，不會做（亡國奴）嗎？也許做了（亡國奴），别有滋味，方才窩心！本來猶太人有的是錢，毋須顧到有國家，没國家這一件麻煩的事。况且，我們的國家，只知道剝削富人，不爲保護富人；要是一旦做了（亡國奴）聽說東洋國的市政，辦得很好，夜不閉户，道不拾遺，我們富翁，到那時，毋須提心吊膽，謹防綁票。並且還可以節省一筆保鑣的費用，做做（亡國奴），倒也安心！</p>
<p>有一位富翁說：（日本人便併呑了中國，中國人不過暫時做做亡國奴吧了。試看金，元，滿清，雖然呑併過中國，却没有多少時候，便被我中國人同化了；所以我們毋須擔憂啊。）他們因爲忘記了（時代）和（國民性）只看見縱的金，元，滿清，没有看見橫的朝鮮，台灣，也難怪他們！</p>
<p>有一位富翁說：（做亡國奴，終比共産來得好。）做亡國奴，雖然也分等級，菲律賓做美國的亡國奴，比印度做英國的亡國奴優待；印度做英國的亡國奴，比朝鮮做日本的亡國奴優待，也是他們富翁，生不逢辰，旣不能做美的亡國奴，又不能做英的亡國奴，做了日本的亡國奴，究竟比做（白俄）來體面，也許依然可以享福！</p>
<p>不過他們躺在沙發裹讀報的時候，曉得日寇一天天打進來了，良心上也許有些感覺。（嘉定三屠），（揚州十日），難道我們（天之驕子），！富翁官僚竟要親身輪着的嗎？不覺心房裹跳了起來。所以在下不客氣，要勸勸諸位，還是早些覺悟，看穿些吧！</p>
<h3>一件現實的怪事</h3>
<p>嘉定縣屬第三區范家橋季家宅，有季明霞者，務農爲業，家　小康，於前年建有新屋一所，與次子同居，歷來相安無事。不料上年冬間，忽來一無形怪物，時將室中什物毁壤，初祇及臥房，後乃及房外，被弄物件，如碗壺　　桌椅，以及米麥等，而尤喜播弄水缸，缸中稍有積水，不久卽有糠麥磗瓦，或汚物，堆滿其中。作怪時，多在日間，有人亦不稍避，天暗則寂然。明霞家人苦之，焚燒紙錠紙帛求去，亦未見效。次子不勝其擾，因延羽士捉鬼，不特鬼未捉去，抑且騷擾更甚，次子房中初本不去者，後亦往擾，日夜無問每當夜深人靜之際，輒有大聲驚醒，或將室内什物推倒，或揭被，或撃人手足，有時使之滿床皆水。昨據該鄉人言，近該怪仍繼續騷擾，且變本加厲，如此怪事，實聞所未聞，姑錄之以供各界之研究。（如有有效之驅逐方法請錫函三馬路二十四號季君轉交）</p>

<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第五回煮茗度長宵愴懹歲暮題標抗暴日呐喊聲高江氏道：過年總當應個景兒，就是我們家，難得趙連長助我們一把，讓我道了年，我也就打算買一點什麽呢。趙翁道：别了。咱們兩家人口都少，我自强，他是不能回家過年的。今天晚上，我還有點事相煩，請您娘兒倆，替我們包餃子。晚上我們這裹也買了一點菜，就請您到我家過年。也没有什麽，無非是酸菜粉條，羊肉，自已來個涮鍋子，暖暖和和的，取個熱閙勁兒。飯後，咱們不鬭牌也不擲骰子，沏上一壺好香汽，吃着雜𢪧兒，圍着爐子撩個天兒，算是度歲您瞧怎麽様？江氏道：喲？怎好還去吵閙老太爺呢？趙翁還没有答言呢，趙自强就由裹院走出來，因爲是穿軍衣的，不便作揖，就向江氏一抱拳道：老太，您不用客氣，您若是肯賞光，算帮了一個大忙，這話怎麽說呢？都因我老爺子，年年在店裹過年，有店裹人在一處混着，很是熱閙。今年搬到海甸來住，他老人家很是寂寞······江氏笑道：連長，您不用說，我明白了。您營裹有事，只管去，晚上我一定陪着談談。趙自强道：我又不算什麽官，也不知道什麽官排子，還有我家那小林，也讓他陪着老太爺，若是大姑娘已肯去，一共有四個人，談起來就熱閙得多了。江氏笑着點點頭道：好！吃了飯，我準去。趙自强道：請您别客氣，你就别客氣了。我家裹又不辦什麽，就是我老爺子自已配的羊肉涮鍋子。您不去，是那様辦，去了也是那様辦。何必不熱閙熱閙呢？江氏覺得他爺兒倆盛意殷勤，果然不去，未免太不懂人情了。於是笑道：那麽着，我娘倆一準來叨擾。說一句不見外的話，請老太爺自已别費事，我娘兒倆一會兒過來替老太爺做。趙自强又抱着拳道：那就很感激，天快黑了，我得趕回營去。說畢，怱怱的向外走。（五○）</p>
<h3>查</h3>
<p>— 石顔也</p>
<p>查有臨時委派的查，有永久特設的查·臨時委派，是查一件事的是非黑白，水落石出·永久特設，是對某一事業予以監督，促其向上發展·所以前者是消極的，後者是積極的·今日之查，無論是消極的積極的，總不出查經上勢力利祿面情三講之範圍湯逃將經政府一查之下，賜封軍長；主席殺人，監察御史查後没有下文；李頓爵士東來調查後，事情就算完結·縣長局長一經查到，便撤職懲辦，或罰薪俸，或站木籠·人家都說爲甚有的查得不明不白，有的水落石出·我道這些人没有讀過查經，查經上第一講勢力中有這様的要句曰：（查者勢力大於被查者，則查出後賞罰分明·查者祇有空架子而没有實力可畏被查者，則應倒黑爲白，當罰而賞，或查後不必有下文·）明乎此，則自然没有懹疑了·一位朋友講他的友人在什麽廳裹擔任查各縣的職務，所查到的各縣長，没有一個不好，而他的月薪名爲百四十元，因此實際上則每超過數倍·視學員到一學校，問問有幾位先生，幾位學生，在全校走馬看花一趟，更算了事這在查經上第二講利祿中也明白規定說：（被查者如孝敬查者，則應倒黑爲白·又說：（查者之職務是查，能查便已盡責，何必問好壤·）能如此，則自利可得，飯碗可保，而祿在其中矣查到相識之人，每每馬虎了事，或查也呌他好，不查也呌他好，查經第三講面情中說：（查者對於被查者有關係淵源，不可鐵面無私，當保留人情，以私廢公）查經旣如是說，又那可不馬虎呢？</p>

<h3>繞線球家事小指南</h3>
<p>— 鵑雲</p>
<p>常常好在家裹打絨線活的姊妹，每每要央求人替伊綳着線，好讓伊繞成一個個的絨線球。但是有時找不到帮忙的人，更用着椅子背來代替綳線的差事，不過終究還覺着不大合適，倘若你家裹有兩隻新式的熨斗，或者就是電熨斗也好，你可以拿來放在距離位罫置適宜的地方，讓它替你綳着線，那們就可以不必再請教别人了，而且還十分省力。（熨斗上有執手柄）</p>
<p>剌繡描様</p>
<p>剌繡描様實在費事，在一般擅長丹青能作畫的人，自然能依照着様紙以畫一張下來。不過大部份人描花様都是用複寫紙的，但是複寫紙時常會弄髒一塊好好的料子，而且様紙也經不起三次兩次便不能再應用了。現在想起了一個簡單的方法，可以用様紙釘在玻璃窗上，再用素綢或素緞覆在上面，對着日光或燈光，依着透視的花様細細去鈎描，豈不是省事呢？不過黑色及深色的綢緞不能適用，有花紋的綢緞也描畫不清。</p>
<p>燙手的柄</p>
<p>用銅壺鐵鍋尤其是鎳製的東西，經過了熱的火一燒，炙熱得不能近手，要是就近有一塊抺布。自然也會想着襯一塊抺布去拿。不過有時候燒得過沸，急不暇擇，往往灼傷了手，這是家家的常事。在人人以爲灼傷手並不算什麽要緊，究竟也是苦痛而麻煩的事。若是能在新買來的時候，在壺柄鍋柄上用舊布紮好，再用線纒緊，那末便不再有什麽意外了。</p>
<p>除去油跡</p>
<p>油跡染在隨便什麽一種物質之上，祇須用棉紙沾了此硼砂粉用手趕快擦去那油跡，那末無論什麽油跡及無論是什麽東西，都有奇效的。</p>
<p>刷洗手套</p>
<p>常常看見人家洗手套，似乎處處都洗得乾凈，但是手指頭上總洗不乾凈，確算是一種遺憾。倘若你在刷洗手套的時候，你將手套帶在手上再去刷洗，那末手指頭上的缺點可以無慮了。</p>
<p>牆上的釘</p>
<p>用釘在牆上釘，往往爲牆上的灰粉壁，而釘不進去，待到釘了進去的時候，却又嫌鬆得一拔便出，簡直掛不起什麽東西。要是在牆上東是一個釘眼，西是一個釘眼，似乎又不大雅觀了；所以要是釘眼嫌鬆的時候，可以用厚紙（如馬糞紙之類）略澹水塞在釘眼内，再用釘從紙眼内釘去，就可以牢固了。</p>
<p>小鹽瓶</p>
<p>要從一大包東西中，裝一些在一隻小瓶子裹，一定會灑地滿地滿桌子，譬如我們有一大包鹽，要裝滿一瓶餐室桌上的小鹽瓶，似乎有些爲難吧？倘若你用一個信封，將鹽裝一些在信封内，在信封的一角上穿一個小眼，從小眼裹倒在小瓶裹，那就决不致於再灑在外面了。</p>

<p>寫字檯上用吸水紙，人人知道可以吸收未乾的字跡。倘若你在一隻無論是木頭茶盤或是金屬製的茶盤，你照着盤子中大小，剪兩張吸水紙墊在盤底，那末無論送茶送水，更不論是送到客室，或者是病室中，决不會再讓盤子和杯子有一些響聲了；同時就是杯子中灑出了些茶或是水漬，這吸水紙是可以立刻收吸乾凈的。</p>

<h3>上海市近十年來醫藥鳥瞰（續）</h3>
<p>— 龐京周</p>
<p>第四章業務之情形（乙）新藥界的業務配方商所用的麻醉品。是舉國通令禁止入口的。然而買者自買。賣者自賣。到底正當藥用麻醉品的供應量多少。到如今也没有規定。因比規矩的藥房。往往因確守法令。而致供不應求。不規則的藥商。却可以濫售此等藥品。以爲副業。同様的現狀。是注射器的進口。雖規定了醫家簽字方可定貨。然而市上那些貨物。可以流入任何雜醫之手。又是那裹來的呢。這又是衛生法令和藥界中一個畸形的現狀。配方商不是可以純粹專營配方業的。上海市内華人自營者。不過二十處左右。而這二十多家都是俗稱大藥房。照例兼營本牌成藥。出售化妝香品。並且帶做原料器械批發生意。否則也萬萬不能開支。此外另有一種成藥商。例如專出某種成藥。創立一個店名的。市内也有近十家。但與眞正醫界。關係甚少。（如永安堂虎標藥品等皆是家用藥品）外國人在市内所營藥店甚多。尤其小規模的俄國藥房。在十年以内大爲增加。我約略計算上海各國藥房。有四十餘家。可以正式營業。其中頗有幾家外藥商。領有我國衛生署藥師執照。高高掛起。不過想招攬華人醫師的處方罷了。</p>
<p>此外就要算外國藥廠。有的是由洋行代理。有的自設分行所在上海。專售原料。成藥。注射劑。器械等。却與配方製藥完全不同。僅僅是販賣性質而已。照例他們的藥。應該批發給藥房。或醫院。未便直接賣給民衆。然而他們却大登廣告。徧派跑街。竭力兜銷與各醫師。各雜醫。竟有直接賣給居户的傾向。這且不管。最不應該的。就是出了許多醫藥夾雜的刋物。什麽（梅毒療法）（ＸＸ醫報）（ＸＸ藥報）等書專供一知半解的醫者。以及舊醫採用新藥的人們借鏡。藉以遂他傾銷藥品的目的。不待正當的需要。那些刋物的内容。名詞旣不一律。學理竟有偏執。並没有經我們中國醫學界同意。於是一般雜醫。拿他當教科書讀。讀後就以藥找病。並不因病求藥。所以報紙上發見什麽廉價注射的廣告。登着（阿爾梯共每針○元）。（德國獅牌六零六每針○元）。（法國九一四每針○元）。好似呌病家自已斷定了什麽病。該用什麽藥。就呌他去打一針便了。造成這種怪現象。未始不是幾分藥廠傾銷政策的流毒。並且各國藥廠又多。同一化學製品。註册名稱不能犯複。以致藥名之繁。於是新藥目錄。在各藥房總彙可查者。竟有藥名一萬幾千種之多。（我個人接到各藥廠兜銷的藥名。已一千七百多種）。其中著名有效。治病必需者。固屬不少。而荒唐不經。毫無價値者未免　入。還有改頭換面。貶價競爭的。實在把藥市攪亂得不堪。</p>
<h3>怎様維持身體的健康（上）</h3>
<p>— 江俊孫</p>
<p>怎様可以維持你身體的健康？這個問題，自古以來，有過很多很多的人，注意研究着，秦始皇曹操等輩之講求長生不老法術，亦即是這些意思。我們人類，眞正健康無病的人，實在可說是没有。然而人們必先健康，才有健全的精神，才能努力於他自已的事業。那末健康是一個比任何事，都重要的問題，那能不去研究他，注重他呢？我們中國人，的確没有研究他，没有注重他，好比一輛車的主人，有了汽車，只會用，不會保護防備，小釘子鬆了，不知道去弄好，直等到出了大毛病，甚而至於把生命都送掉了，這是多麽可憐的事情啊！依前天上海公共租界工部局發表去年一九三二年的人口死亡率，外國人每千人只死了一二·八·我中國人每千人要死一七·八·中外兩種人的比較，每一千中國人裹面，要多死五人，全上海住的中國人口，約計有三百萬，依此推算，那麽我們中國人在去年之中，多死去了一萬五千個人了。每個人的價値，至少說算他代表五百元，那麽上海去年一年之中，就多損失了七百五十萬元了。上海的衛生狀况，比較内地尚稱優良，而事實尚且如此，我中國全國的人民，因爲不健康而寃枉死去的，不知道有多少。民爲邦本，我中國的社會政治，以及其他一切的不健全，都是我人民身體不健康的結果。身體健康，不只與個人有益，亦是强國强種的唯一方法。</p>
<p>現在我講一件故事來說明健康與近世，經濟的密切關係，南北美洲之間，有一條巴拿馬運河，誰都知道是溝通大西洋太平洋的唯一人工開成的河道，它在經濟上的重要性是很大的，早先經法國人開闢了二次，化去了很多的錢，都因爲開河的工人，身體不健康而失敗，九年之中，單在於瘧疾的，有二萬人左右，病的不知有多少，直到一九○四年，美國人接辦了，首先注意工人健康的保護，除去瘧疾的根源，不出幾年，運河開通，大功告成，從此在交通上，文化上，經濟上，發生了大大的影響，醫學上亦添了一頁光榮的歷史。</p>
<p>可是物質文明愈發逹，世界交通愈便利，人們的疾病健康的仇敵亦增加了，結核病仍舊猖獗得了不得，每年死於心臟病的人，據美國的統計，每年有十七萬人之多，每天要死四百六十五人，糖尿病亦年有增加，不治的癌病，現在此從多了若干倍，被瘧疾害死的人，有幾百萬，工業發逹，人類的壽命更短，於是近世的醫學，亦起了變化，醫生的職務，亦由醫療疾病，而跳到注重健康的預防醫學上面去了。</p>
<p>預防醫學，研究及實行，是怎様使人不生病他的工作，有公衆與個人的分别，公衆的，就是公共衛生學。它注意自來水，房屋，街道，工廠，醫院等等清潔消毒工作，上海工部局衛生處，上海市衛生局，所做的事情，就是此種工作。現在要請注意的，住在上海公共租界的住民，所付的捐錢，十分之一是用在這工作上邊的。個人衛生，脚踏實地地防是教人注健康的實用方法，我現在因爲時間關係，只能說個大槪，他的實行方法，可以分做三段講：（未完）</p>
<h3>告患性病（花柳病）者（上）</h3>
<p>— 胡嘉言</p>
<p>我在本刋上發表了一篇設立梅毒免費病院議後，不料接着好幾封來信，信中除希望這件事能實現外、大多數都囑我代他介紹一個名符其實的性病專科醫生，治療他們身受的苦痛，以免一誤再誤，我狠慚愧，自已在上海開業雖四五年，生性不慣交際，認識的人狠少，究竟同道中有幾位是專精研究的，都不狠熟悉；即有時聽見别人說起，曉得某某所長，但學行是否完全相符，（即醫家之道德）狠成問題。所以對於來信甚覺抱嫌，愛莫能助。但醫師雖不敢介紹，僞醫欺諞病家的普偏情形，我是略知一二；此種漆黑一團是非顛倒的結果，一年中眞不知有多少病家上他的當。我現在且給記得的先寫出來，以使病家就醫時有所認識及采擇，諒來也不無小補的。（一）性病的範圍，是包括梅毒淋病軟性下疳三者而言，這三病每病有他特殊的診狀和治療方法，决不能混在一起的。但不幸的病家一患到性病，無論是梅毒或白濁，下疳軟性或硬性，總希望醫師馬上代他注射九一四，好像非此不足以盡心的，碰着不識時務的醫師，一定想和他說個明白；但結果不了解的病家還是狠多，甚至懷疑醫師别有用意。固然有些病家同時患二症，在事實上時常可看見的，並且一個人旣然患了梅毒，决不能說不會傳染白濁的；但應該雙方都有相當的症象纔行，决不能說九一四可以治療白濁的，這種例子，就我個人一年中所見的已經不少，想别的醫師也是一様的；這種見解，病家總不會自我作古杜撰，當然是看見别的醫生有這様治法或者由其病家傳說方如此的；其間多黃金錢事情還小，致是非顛倒，其病陷於遷延不治，則流弊不堪設想的。所以我要切實　照病家一句話，就是：白濁自白濁，梅毒是梅毒，兩者治療决不能混在一起的。這一點正確認識，關係於病家本身是不在小的。（二）病家一有了痛苦，大多數總希望就專科醫生診治，他們覺得旣稱專科，着過這一類病一定比别人多，經騐也豐富，這種見解本來是狠對的。但此例决不能語諸性病一方面，我覺得這方面的專家，至少有十之七八是名不符實的，有好些醫師，因爲患性病的特殊多，想藉這頭銜使營業發逹也有的。但這還不致發生流弊。大多數則係因内科外科以及其他各科如絲毫無根抵不易冒充，祗有性病這一門比較好些，門類不多，固定的特效療法也祇有幾個，治法不對流弊也較少，就是醫壞了，好在患本病者大半是　人的，發生交涉爲例也不多。所以一般學書學劍不成的份子，都視此爲終南捷徑，差不多每一條馬路或一條弄口總有幾個性病專有來點綴塲面；弄到結果，一般人都目我們新醫除治性病外毫無他長，甚至說除注射九一四外毫無别様辦法，這完全是由於他們作俑的。</p>
<p>上面話雖如此說，我並不是認上海地方專家二個也没有，不過冒牌的佔最多</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>數，病家須格外留心罷了。但是病家如尋到專家療治，我也有幾句話須和病家解釋的。第一專家雖有較勝他醫之處，但並不能和舊醫方面的數代祖傳獨得秘方相提並論；他們治療梅毒，當然是在砒劑水銀劑碘劑鉍劑這幾種範圍内，其他病也是一様的。所以病家也不能希望於九一四注射外，或且另外有一種一九二百二十，爲别人所不知的。這種觀念完全是錯誤的。第二專家診斷病，並不是說别人疑難的地方，他一看就曉得是什麽病；返過來說，别人對於本病已經有了血清或顯微鏡種種顛撲不破的證明，專家也當然不會說我另有所見的，假使這個醫師雖然有了好幾種事實，而在没有充分證據以前，總不願妄加證斷。這種態度是狠正當的。中國人件件事都喜歡神奇，我希望病家都應該抛却這二種觀念，免致上冒牌專家的當纔好。</p>
<p>（三）病家一有了病，除希望可靠的醫師外，第二當然是希望他的病早點好了！這種觀念，是没有一個不是如斯的；尤以我國經濟落後，國人生計萬分艱難，除少數有錢的外，差不多在醫藥費方面，有時也非打算盤不可的，在此種狀態下，他們認爲是狠好的機會到了。什麽一針見効呀，二針斷根呀，立止白濁呀，一星期包愈橫痃呀，這種五花八門的宣傳招徠手段，述不勝述，書不勝書，假使他們眞有這様成績，那我敢代表病家泥首禮謝。無奈離現在科學醫事實上還遠呢！即退一步，没有這様超羣的成績，但還按步就班走正當的治療途徑，雖名不符實，究與病者本身無害，那還罷了！但事實那裏是如此的呢？我聽見一熟識病人說起，有一位醫生他代病人檢騐血液，視其梅毒之有無，手續狠簡單，馬上就可以給病家看的。我當時聽了莫明其妙。後來問一位同學，纔知道他們取得病人血液後，裏面加些重炭酸鈉置入試騐管中，用火燃燒，一方面並面告病家，這血液沸騰上昇是有毒的確證。我們曉得，檢查梅毒方法，在現在以瓦司蔓反應比較最準確；這手續及設備並不簡單，在尋常醫師診所能担任的狠少。像這様的簡易速成法，那眞可算極荒唐之大觀了！這様情形，大慨總不會虚，舉此例彼，我們也可以想到他們的治療花様也定不在少的。</p>

<h3>科學的逹生篇（十四）</h3>
<p>— 俞松筠</p>
<p>（四）剪臍帶法剪臍帶時，最須嚴密的消毒，與止血完全，并宜速使臍帶乾燥，爲唯的要點，胎兒娩出後數分鐘，須待臍動脈與臍靜脈均不摶動而停止時大約在産後三五分鐘，即可施剪切斷</p>
<p>爲什麽要待臍帶摶動停止後，方可施行結紥？因爲臍帶及胎盤内血液，運輸至胎兒，那末胎兒血量，可以增加六十至百克</p>
<p>倘胎兒在假死狀態時，須速施行急救手術，那末；不必等待臍帶轉動的停止，就有速行臍帶切斷的必要</p>
<p>切斷臍帶時，在臍環（或稱臍根）距離約二三橫指，紥成一結，離此再紥第二結，在此二結之間，即可切斷臍帶</p>
<p>第一個結的用意，乃是防止胎兒出血，倘臍帶膠質過多，在近臍環處，再加一結，以保萬一</p>
<p>第二個結，乃是防止臍帶胎盤方面的出血，若不結紥，不但汚穢牀褥，且使胎盤剝離，引起不良作用，倘遇雙胎時，胎盤裏的兩兒血管，互相連接的話，那末；第二胎因此失血而死亡的，亦未始没有</p>
<p>結紥線尋常用的是蔴線綿線絲線或絹絲，剪臍帶的剪刀，在剪尖端，須稍圓滑而彎曲，以防母子身體之受損傷，以上兩件及折臍綳帶，均須嚴密消毒，否則；臍帶的病毒傳染，實在危險萬分臍帶切斷後的兩重結法，在第一結完了，近臍環處再紥第二結，再將第一結之線廻繞一次，在臍帶切斷面及其四周，用火酒拭凈，然後再用消毒綳帶紮緊，以期止血而消毒完全</p>
<p>臍帶須保持乾燥，四周撒以殺菌收澰粉劑，例如（代而馬吐）ＤＥＲＭＡＴＯＬ或硼酸粉等類，以便早日乾燥，愼弗被小便沿濕，大約三日至五日，即可脫落，臍帶脫落後，仍須撒粉，並用消毒紗布紮緊，切弗用舊式膏藥粘貼，以防腐蝕</p>
<p>（戊）後産期的處置</p>
<p>（一）後産期陣痛胎兒産出後，就是分娩第三期，在此時期，最應注意的要點，乃爲子宮的收縮，與出血的數量，如果兩者，均無異常情形，那末，可聽自然的經過</p>
<p>胎兒娩出後，未幾；即起所謂後産期陣痛，經過十五分至三十分鐘，胎盤從子宮壁剝離，約經一時有半，胎盤脫離子宮腔，以逹子宮頸及陰道穹窿處，於是胎盤娩出，是爲正軌，如無特殊變化（即所謂子宮弛緩症出血等徵候），除經醫師助産適當之治療外，切弗輕易施用手術，否則；反令産婦蒙受不利</p>
<h3>疾病常識問答（續）</h3>
<p>— 程瀚章</p>
<p>問呼吸器有變化嗎？答有扁桃腺炎，支氣管炎或因誤嚥而起肺炎。呼吸促迫，起一種長短呼吸。問這種病全部經過情形怎様？</p>
<p>答到發病後第二星期，取不幸的轉歸；即使幸而治愈，也要遺留聽力和視力障礙，精神障害，肌肉强直，麻痺，慢性水腫等，問腦脊髓膜炎診斷的時候，把什麽做目標？答就是突然發病，强度頭痛，腦症狀，項部强直，刻尼歇氏症候，知覺過敏，和脊髓液變化等。最妥的是在脊髓液中證明病原菌。問腦脊髓膜炎的豫後，怎様？答豫後不良，死亡率占百分之四十到七十。問怎様可以豫防？答把病人隔離。用消毒藥水漱喉，和洗鼻。流行時，出外戴口鼻罩。罰怎様治療呢？答避去外來一切剌戟，病室宜黑暗，頭部和脊柱部用冰囊，冰枕；或於頂部用吸角，貼芥子硬膏。内服　素劑。此外注意通便，排尿，或行腰椎穿剌减輕液壓。此外在早期注射腦膜炎菌血清注射於脊膜腔内（注射前先穿剌排出十至二十立方糎的脊髓液）有時見效。</p>
<p>（六）百日咳</p>
<p>問百日咳，是什麽病？答百日咳，是一種發作性咳嗽，屬於傳染性的呼吸器疾病，並且是頑固而遷延很久的，所以有百日咳的名稱。</p>
<p>問百日咳，還有别的名稱嗎？答還有天哮嗆，　　嗆等名稱。問這種病西文是什麽？答拉丁文學名是ＰＥＲＴＵＳＳＩＳ，德文呌ＫＯＵＣＨＨＵＳＴＥＮ，英文俗名ＷＨＯＯＰＩＮＧＣＯＵＧＨ。問病變的部位，在什麽地方？答以侵害呼吸道的粘膜爲主，發作特有的痙攣性咳嗽。問百日咳患者，有年齡和性别的關係嗎？答有的。普通小兒患的最多，成人罹病的很少。女孩比男兒爲多。問這種病的病原是什麽？答有人發見一種百日咳桿菌，但同時往往於病人的痰中證明其他許多細菌。</p>
<p>問傳染後經過幾久的潛伏期，纔發病？答約一星期的潛伏期後纔發病。問發病的時期，分幾期？答有黏膜炎期，痙攣期，和减退期三期。</p>
<p>問黏膜炎期的病狀怎様？答以　　驟然開始，起鼻黏膜炎，咳嗽，咽喉黏膜潮紅，食慾減退，元氣沮喪等。聽診時有支氣管雜音。經過約七天到十天左右。問痙　期的病狀怎様？答這時期的咳嗽，愈加激劇，成爲發作性。發作時因爲聲帶的痙　而發出一種口留狀的聲音，屢次在深吸氣之後，發出長時的咳嗽。有一種回聲。（這是特有的，）往往伴以面部發青藍症狀，頸靜脈怒張，流涙，有時見黏膜出血，眼臉腫脹，舌下面小潰瘍等。又常引起嘔吐。也有無意間洩出尿糞的。發作劇烈時，有到起窒悶等情的。每天發作逹數十回，夜間尤甚。咳嗽到黏稠的黏液喀出，纔告一段落。發作停止後，全身疲勞，不久就恢復快樂。這様痙攣期的持續，逹數星期甚至數月，漸漸减輕發作的程度和頻度，然後移行到减退期。問減退期的病狀怎様？答這時期的發作雖消失，但支氣管黏膜的過敏長時存續。咳嗽，變爲普通的黏膜炎性。然也有再發痙攣性的。問在百日咳的病期中有什麽併發症？答有合併支氣管肺炎而陷於重篤症狀的；也有引起泄瀉而陷於營養不良的。此外還有合併麻疹，白喉，肺氣腫等，病後更有患肺結核的。問百日咳的預後良不良？答身體本來康健的小兒，大都佳良。但虚弱的小兒或合併肺炎的，危險得很。問這種病怎様預防？答健康的小兒，切勿接近病人，病人的喀痰，都須用消毒藥水消毒。又百日咳混合菌漿的預防注射，效力確實。問病人的食養法怎様？答給以滋養豐富的食品（避去剌戟性食物）。住在乾燥清潔的空氣中，日光要充分。没有合併症的時候，不妨到房屋外面走動。遷地到山間或海濱暫住，是很有利益的。問藥物，用什麽最妥？答在黏膜炎期，用袪痰藥和温飲料。痙攣期中，可用些解熱鎭靜藥像奎寗，優奎寗，安替比林，溴化鉀，模仿，等。注射用百日咳感作菌漿注射，分四五次，每次隔二三天。或用醚滴注直腸内，有效。</p>
<h3>新醫藥發逹過程中幾個重要的發見和發明（四）</h3>
<p>— 顧壽白</p>
<p>這紅血輪的移動，居然能看出血液循環的道理。此外劉氏還藉了他的鏡片的力量，發見了許多事實。例如皮膚，齒牙和其他體部的構造以及植物和下等動物的細微構造，也都是極重要的部分。他雖然使用他的鏡片確能看出别人所不能見的物像，可是同時代的人們對於他所發見的物像的記錄未必都能相信。他雖然只用他的簡單的鏡片而不用複式的顯微鏡，但是他對於顯微鏡的工作要算第一個有功的人物，卻是毫無疑義的了。</p>
<p>至於複式顯微鏡的發明家似乎是一五九零年荷蘭的眼鏡製造署詹士）ＺＡＮＳＺ）氏。他的顯微鏡的構造極爲簡單，只是兩個凸鏡組合而成的。在上的一個，稱爲對眼鏡；在下的一個，稱爲對物鏡。但是缺點很多，物像旣不明顯，並且夾雜許多色彩。後來這些缺點一部分由多龍（ＤＯＬＬＯＮＤ）氏，一部分由土累（ＴＵＬＯＹ）氏將其除去，而最値得注意的，就是防腐法發明者李士脫氏的父親（Ｊ·Ｊ·ＬＩＳＴＥＲ）的改良工作。他居然完成了複式顯微鏡，尤其對於改良收色對物鏡最有功績。　　自從一八○○年以至於今日，顯微鏡的構造改良，幾已逹到進步的極點。一八三○年李士脫（ＪＯＳＥＰＨＪＡＣＫＳＯＮＬＩＳＴＥＲ）發明了消色鏡片。一八二三年須伐利（ＣＨＥＶＡＬＩＥＲ）發明了複式接物鏡。其後還有阿卑（ＡＢＢＥ）氏照輝裝置（ＡＰＯＣＢＲＯＭＡＴＩＣＬＥＮＳ），油浸裝置，調節接物鏡等物發明，於是顯微鏡的效用就更完備。我想將來還要改良進步，也是無疑的了。</p>
<p>複式顯微鏡的發明和改良，對於醫學各方面的發展，影響極大。現在試將最重要的舉些出來。　　組織學原是微細的解剖學，就是研究人體微細組織的學科。劉文赫氏已經在一六七三年發見了人血中的紅血輪和乳汁中的脂肪球，一六七九年發見了肌肉的橫紋，不久又發見了眼球内水晶體的構造，還有一六六八年他發見了微血管内的血液循環，上文已經說過了。十六世紀的馬爾披忌（ＭＡＲＣＬＬＥＯＭＡＬＰＩＧＨＩ）氏也曾用顯微鏡觀察蛙的肺臟和腸間膜中血液循環的狀態；這對於哈維氏的血液循環說發生了不少的好影響。馬氏在一六八七年又用顯微鏡觀察雞卵的發育，連初期的狀態也都看到。一六七二年格拉夫（ＧＲＡＡＦ）氏發見胞卵。一六七七年哈門氏發見精蟲。這些顯微鏡的觀察，都和胎生學的發逹很有關係。在病理學方面，十八世紀中葉的時候，維也納（ＷＩＥＮ）的羅幾坦斯基（ＫＡＰＩＦＲＥＩＨＥＲＲＶＯＮＲＯＫＩＴＡＮＳＫＹ）氏纔利用顯微鏡來研究病理學，創立顯微鏡的病理學，就是病理組織學的基礎，爲病理學進步上開一新紀元。其後柏林（ＢＥＲＬＩＮ）的費爾孝（ＲＵＤＯＬＦ）</p>
<p>（ＶＩＲＣＨＯＷ）氏當一八四四年在柏林大學的時候，對於，當時盛行研究的胎生學和須來登（ＳＣＨＬＥＩＤＥＵ），須王（ＳＣＨＷＡＮＮ）氏等的細胞論大加注意。他利用顯微鏡研究的結果，後來不久在一八五八年果然創設了細胞病理學，將歷來的液體病理說，固體病理說以及神經病理說，活力說等一齊推翻，竭力主張病的現象，發生部位以及本態都在乎細胞，以爲一般病理學的本態不外病理生理，而生命現象成立的根原則在於細胞内。他將人體視爲一個細胞國，而各個細胞則視爲國民。當時病理組織的研究十分發逹的結果，就發見了癌細胞，結核細胞，癩細胞和其他的特異性細胞，認爲這些都有病原性，所以他的見解以爲疾病是細胞國内因這種病原細胞存在而引起的革命，並且是各個國民騷動的狀態。</p>
<p>構成生物學基礎的細胞形態學的發逹，與顯微鏡的發明也大有關係。在十七世紀的中葉，已經有許多學者在顯微鏡下發見了植物的細胞。後來又有些人發見了核和核小體。十八世紀初葉摩爾（ＨＵＧＯＶＯＮＭＯＨＬ）氏曾將植物性細胞的内容物質命名曰原漿。</p>
<p>一八三九年須王（ＴＨＥＯＤＯＲＳＣＨＷＡＯＵ）氏利用顯微鏡研究動植物構造知發生的共通性，其結果就知道動物的各器官也由細胞發育而成，和植物一様。</p>
<p>如前所述。由顯微鏡的研究結果，就認定：在生物學上，無論動物或植物，無論構造簡單或複雜，那細胞都是形態的和官能的單位。這個事實的發見，不久就擴張到胎生學和病理學方面了。</p>
<p>十七世紀新發明的顯微鏡，到了十九世紀，加以消色鏡片，油浸裝置，集光裝置等附件的發明和改良，已逹到完美的地位。同時又有染色法和切片刀的發明，於是解剖學上的研究更由肉眼的方面進步到顯微鏡的方面，並且向兩個新方面展開。詳說起來，就是：在形態方面成爲組織學，在發生方面成爲胎生學，同時因細胞學進步的緣故，對於疾病的研究也向細胞組織方面注意起來，於是就成立了所謂細胞病理學；又對於病原體方面也注意研究單細胞的微生物，於是就成立了所謂微菌學了。</p>
<p>自從費爾孝氏的細胞病理學成立了以後，在外科方面，對於腫瘍的診斷和治療，也就更進一步。倘若没有顯微鏡，怎能逹到這個境界呢？</p>
<p>此外顯微鏡的發明與微生物學，傳染病學以及寄生蟲學的發逹更有密切的關係，詳見下文。</p>
<p>至於現代的疾病診斷法，更是非用顯微鏡不可，例如用顯微鏡騐痰，可以看出有無結核菌，肺蛭卵或彈力纖維等；騐血可以計算紅血輪和白血球的多寡，白血球的種類以及有無螺旋體或瘧疾胞子蟲等微生物：騐尿除發見各種微菌或絲狀蟲等外，還可看見尿渣中種種的物質；騐糞可以發見各種寄生蟲卵或各種微生物；着些病的材料的檢查，没有顯微鏡怎能辦得到？這顯微鏡的檢查，也和化學的或血清的檢查一様，在疾病的診斷上是新醫家所必不可少的工作，所以顯微鏡實在是新醫的利器之一。</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>（回到農村去！</h3>
<p>— 玄</p>
<p>都市發逹了，桃源式的農村改變面目了，于是乎乃有田園詩人生起懹鄉病來了；這口號是（到農村去！）</p>
<p>前世紀的八十年代，俄國的知識分子因爲革命運動在都市裹碰了壁，于是乎也要轉換革命運動的方向；那口號就是（到民間去！）所謂（民間），也指的農村。</p>
<p>這兩種不同的（到農村去）的呼聲，我們也聽得我們的知識分子有一時呌過了。可是近來却又聽得了第三種的（回到農村去）的呼聲；這，一見於影片（城市之夜）末尾的字幕，再見於申報讀者顧問欄内（回到農村去的討論），三見於民國二十一年度中國銀行營業報告的結論，（二十二年度金融政策之轉移，）主張（向之投資視線集中於通商口岸者，今旣知非内地健康無以增進國民經濟之繁榮，宜尋覓安全之途徑，以集中之資金，散而還諸内地。）</p>
<p>（城市之夜）是勸告那些抛棄農村而擠在都市裏的窮人（回到農村去建造農村的天堂；）上海銀行家主張把那些集中到都市的資金（回到農村去）恢復内地的健康；而（回到農村去的討論）中那幾位正面主張者則要人帶了銀子去開發農村。三者之中，自然是銀行家最高明。因爲農村裏所缺乏者，確不是人，而是資金。</p>
<p>但是（近來内地植桑之户，不能育蠶，問其故則曰：不得一元以購蠶種。）中國銀行報告書又這様描寫了農村的貧乏。這就是說農民非但没有一塊錢的儲蓄，並連一塊錢的債也借不動，因爲他早已押盡當光。所以除非上海銀行家肯以放賬的形式把資金（散而還諸内地。）不然，農民還是不得一元以購蠶種！　　原來資金還到農村，（宜尋覔安全之途徑。）可惜這（安全之途徑）何在，中行報告書裏没有明白告訴我們！</p>
<h3>（回農村去）與（吃肉糜）</h3>
<p>— 楊幸之</p>
<p>不久以前，我曾看過一張呌做（城市之夜）的國産影片。記得最後一幕是一羣在都市裏失業無法生活的男女老糼。愉快地大踏步地朝着鄉村的路上走。有人問他們（將往那裏去？）那答語是非常乾脆：（回農村去！）回農村去嗎？當時我很替他們着急，很想再追問他們一句，但接着我又意識到這只是（做戲），這一羣（假）苦力們並不是眞的要回農村去，所以也就没曾和那傻樵夫一斧頭劈死戲台上的秦檜一様硬把他們拉回來。</p>
<p>最近幾天，在本報讀者顧問欄内，又熱烈地辯論着（回農村去）一問題。這一辯論的引出，是因爲有幾位坐在舒服的沙發上，眼睛望着太平洋之彼岸的（中國籍）的（外國朋友），硬勸在都市裏無法生活的失業青年（回農村去）。甚至還爲他作出聰明的工作方案，勸他用十年的苦工，建設一個意想中的（世外桃源）。於是這辯論便展開了！</p>
<p>其實，勸失業青年回農村去的那些人們，在他們的思想體系上是並没有什麽錯誤的，錯誤的只是他不該專是安坐在舒服的沙發上，不該專是把眼睛遠望着太平洋的彼岸，不該專是看璇宮艶史，或草裙艶舞之類，而不略一翻閱滿載着農村崩潰情事的中國報章。從前，我們不是曾經聽到過一個　皇帝的故事嗎？那故事是當一個大飢荒的年頭，百姓都没有飯吃，而我們的傻皇帝却很驚奇的問他的待臣道：（百姓没有飯吃，爲什麽不吃肉糜呢？）實在這位皇帝又何嘗是眞傻呢？傻的只是他只知道做皇帝罷了！一個人的思想不是實際地受着某一種固定的經濟背景的支配和决定嗎？</p>
<p>從事實上說，勸失業青年回農村去的人們，他就根本不懂在資本主義經濟體系下，農村只是都市的附庸，而離田的農民恰是都市中的勞働的後備軍的理論，同時他更根本不知道都市裏的失業者究竟是從那裏來的？又根本不知道當前中國農村破落到了怎様的程度？而這種破落的現象又是怎様發生的？或者還可以說，他就根本不懂得政治和經濟的關聯，所以他只是閉着眼睛瞎呌：（美國是怎様呀），（英國又是怎様呀），（因此我們也就可以怎様呀），有這様巧妙的邏輯，自然會在腦子裏産生出巧妙的（世外桃源），自然會勸人回農村去。很可惜的是他們勸人家去（世外桃源）享福，而他們自已却始終没曾打算脫離塵濁的都市。</p>
<p>都市失業者爲什麽不回農村去呢？荒年爲什麽不食肉糜呢？是之謂（無獨有偶），是之謂（雙絶）！</p>
<p>編者按：近來（到農村去）的呼聲，此起彼應，呌得頗是熱閙。本刋同日收到玄先生和楊先生的大作，意思雖大致相同，但仍有可以彼此補助的地方，所以就都給發表了。</p>
<h3>出路</h3>
<p>— 吳貫忠</p>
<p>雯聽見卿伯伯說洗君行裏有個缺，呌他下午一路到洗君家裏去接洽的時候，喜歡得心都跳出來了，但他竭力裝着鎭靜的様子問題：（那是個什麽職位？）</p>
<p>（阿洗介紹的事不會錯的！）卿伯伯睜一睜眼，大聲地說。（是抄寫吧，大概二十三元一月！）</p>
<p>（雯兒有了事，就可把家計幫輕一點了。）母親含着謝意歡悅地說。親自把水烟筒遞給卿伯伯。丈夫亡了多年，還有一個這様的朋友肯照顧他的兒子，實在使她感激得很。</p>
<p>雯自從中學畢業後，在家裏閒着有兩年了。今天是他第一次聽到一個這様充滿希望的消息。他實在有點飄飄然，高興得無所措手足了。</p>
<p>午飯時，母親特地買了幾様小菜請卿伯伯，三個人都快快活活地飽吃了一頓。飯後母親立刻拿出一件新衣給他穿上，喜氣盈盈地把他們送到門外，看着他們坐上了黃包車才轉身進去。</p>
<p>這是十二月的嚴寒時候。雯在車上想着會見洗君時說話當如何漂亮，舉動當如何大方，心裏眞是又驚又喜，剌人的寒風吹在面上，他並不覺得冷。</p>
<p>洗君是Ｘ行的重要職員，又是大班陳君的老友。雯和卿伯伯來到他家時，正躺在一張華麗的銅床上抽大烟，他的對面，坐着一個摩登少女，據說是他新近才娶的如夫人。</p>
<p>喝了茶，說了幾句套話後，洗君便對雯說：　　（行裏有一份事，本來二班黃君要介紹給他的朋友的，後來聽見我說有人，他就讓給我了。這職位很有希望，將來有升做經理的可能！並且事情也很便當，祗要每早早一點到行，把大班的寫字間打掃干凈，有客人來時，倒倒茶，拉拉烟），·····</p>
<p>雯聽了這句話，像給刀割一般難受了。這是做聽差啊！多麽難堪！他做着這様的事，給朋友們曉得了怎様呢？他半天來的許多希望，頓時烟消雲散，他感到窒息，苦悶。</p>
<p>（如果你願做，明天我就和你一同見大班，怎様？）（讓我回家問問母親吧！）雯推托了。（不用問了，你自已覺得怎様？）卿伯伯兩眼釘着他。（我麽？······我不願幹！）他决心了。餓死也不願做聽差。</p>
<p>（不要緊，不要緊！有好的機會我再介紹你吧！）洗君又倒在床上抽烟了。一會兒，他噴出一口烟說：（呵唷老陳眞精明他曉得中學畢業生不會幹這種職務的。他說有誰能夠學他呢？他是ＸＸ大學畢業的，但他初出茅蘆時，在外國人面前做過兩年西崽呢！）</p>
<p>這是明明在教訓他了，不，簡直是侮辱他。他站起身，對和他同去的卿伯伯說：（恐怕母親盼望，我要先走了。）但，他拿什麽回去安慰那滿懷希望的母親呢？</p>
<h3>蘧廬絮語</h3>

<p>（二十一）公文程式近見濤聲周刋論大學校長規定學生上書程式，是爲擺架子，打官腔，其說有爲而發，不能謂爲無理。惟予意倘爲炫耀尊嚴，則規定程式者非；倘爲辦事便利，則規定程式爲是。蓋程式旣定，依式而書，作者易作，閱者易閱，旣便於保存，又利於查考，整齊美觀，又其次也。文心雕龍書記篇云，（戰國以前，君臣同書，秦漢立儀，始有表奏。）意謂私書公牘之分，始自秦漢。證之於史</p>

<h3>紅蘿蔔鬚</h3>
<p>— ＪＵＬＥＳＲＥＮＡＲＤ作林取譯</p>
<p>竹鷄</p>
<p>像平常一學，雷辟克把他的獵袋裹的東西通通倒在桌上。這次袋裹倒出來的是兩隻竹鷄。大哥斐利克斯把牠們記在壁間的一塊石版上。這是他的職務。每個孩子都有他的職務。姐姐愛勒絲丁担任的是剝皮或拔毛。至於紅蘿蔔鬚呢，則是專門去結果那些受傷的獵獲物的生命。因爲大家都說他心硬，所以他便取得了這項特權。兩隻竹鷄在擺動着，轉側着頸根。（你不去把牠們弄死還等什麽呢？）雷辟克家的說。（媽媽，我也一様高興輪到我去把牠們記在石版上。）紅蘿蔔鬚說。（石版掛得太高，你寫不到。）雷辟克家的說。（那麽我也一様高興去拔牠們的毛。）紅蘿蔔鬚說。（這不是男子做的事。）雷辟克家的回答。於是紅蘿蔔鬚提起兩隻竹鷄。大家誠懇地指點他一些方法：（緊抓着牠們這個地方，你懂得啦，緊抓着頸根，把毛反過來抓着。）一隻手裹一隻，入在背後，他開始了。（兩隻一次弄嗎，畜生！）雷辟克說。（這様就可以快一點完事。）紅蘿蔔鬚回答。（你不要婆婆媽媽的；你祇顧自已尋開心好了。）雷辟克家的說。竹鷄掙扎着，全身抽動，拍着翅膀散下一地的毛。牠們是永遠不願意死的。他用一隻手絞殺一個小朋友，恐怕還比弄死這兩隻竹鷄容易點。他把牠們夾在兩個膝頭中間，臉上一會兒紅，一會兒白，滿臉是汗。他把頭昂起，什麽都不願看見，手裹抓得更緊。竹鷄頑强抗拒着。他發恨要把牠們快點完結，他抓着牠們的脚爪，把牠們的頭向自已的皮鞋尖上使勁地敲。（啊！這劊子手！這劊子手！）大哥斐利克斯和姐姐愛勒絲丁一齊呌著。（他弄得眞好，）雷辟克家的說。（可憐的畜生，掉在他手裹眞倒霉。）雷辟克雖是一個老練的獵人，也作着惡心跑開了。（好啦！）紅蘿蔔鬚把兩隻死竹鷄丢在桌上說。雷辟克家的把牠們翻來覆去地看。敲破了的小頭蓋上流着血和些許腦漿。（應該早點把牠們縱他手裏奪下來的，）雷辟克家的說，（這不髒得要命嗎？）大哥斐利克斯說：（他這次的確没有弄得像以前幾次那様好。）</p>

<h3>鐵路運輸與農村經濟（下）鄭寳照</h3>
<p>丙、推廣國内農産銷路國中農産之不振，一由於輸出之衰頽，二由於外貨之壓迫，旣如前述。此外國内銷路之狹隘，市塲之弱小，與夫販賣方法之陳舊，亦爲農産凋敝農村破産之重大原因。蓋國内銷路廣，市塲大，則縱有外貨侵凌，或縱無大量輸出，亦必無碍於農産之發展，有之，亦必不如今日之劇烈，此推廣國内銷路之所以爲救濟農村之又一法也。推廣銷路之法，不外二端，即一爲販賣方法之革新，一爲運輸方法之改善，二者缺一不可。前者固非鐵路所單獨能行者，然亦能領導之，促進之，後者則爲鐵路自身之職責，亟應急起實行，不容或緩者。茲請分論之如次：（一）實現販賣與運輸合作查吾國農民之出售其産品也，多恃中間人爲之買賣，其所受一時之盤剝尚小，而所蒙永久之欺蔽尤大。蓋農民無知識，無組織，不知貨物何往，市塲安在，遑言開拓銷路自闢新市塲耶？鐵路對於沿綫之農村，負有輔助改進之職責，亟應利用其領袖地位，就沿路各地，聯絡農民，分别組織販賣運輸合作機關，以代舊式之中間人，而謀農産市塲之開拓。合作之利益不一而足，舉其著者，則（一）免除中間人之盤剝，所獲盈利盡歸社員所有；（二）隨時可作各地市塲之調查，酌盈劑虚，推銷不限於一隅；（三）明瞭市塲需要之變遷，隨時能求其適應；（四）生産過多，銷路不振之時，得貸欵收買以平物價；此就販賣方面言也。至於運輸，則旣由鐵路導其組織，便利經濟，尤不勝言。蓋社員之産品，旣悉數售與合作社，集少成多，化零担爲整車，集整車爲列車，運費之所省，爲數必不貲，向之不可避免之耗費，今一舉而免除之，其有益於農民之收入，當非淺鮮。故除販賣合作外，尚有運輸合作之利益，洵擴張農産銷路之要圖也。</p>
<p>（二）創辦冷藏及保煖運輸農産中之鮮貨，如瓜·果·蔬·菜·等物，夏則易爛，冬則易凍，非有特殊設備，往往不能遠運。西國鐵路多辦有冷藏及保煖運輸業務，夏則用冰，冬則生火，以保障鮮貨之完好，故其鮮果蔬魚介肉卵等物，均能遠運各地，銷路甚廣，吾國鐵路，雖備有少數冰車，迄未用於冷藏。至於保煖業務，亦付缺如，以致各種鮮貨之銷路，往往限於一隅，所謂生産於是，消費於是，其能利用鐵路運至二三百公里以外者，已屬罕見，較諸外國運輸鮮貨之能逹數千里者，奚啻天壤。故不欲推廣鮮貨之銷路則已，否則冷藏與保煖之設備及業務，必不可少。且冷藏業務，不以運輸中之保護爲限，先進國在鐵路終點各站，常建有冷藏倉庫，供貨到囤存之用，或由鐵路自辦，或向外界租用，蓋鮮貨運抵到逹站，未必能全部售去并消費凈盡也，有此車内及站内兩種冷藏設備及業務，而後鮮貨旣可遠運，復可久藏，旣廣銷路，復免貶賣，其有惠於農産之振興，當無待煩言也。</p>
<p>（三）發展近郊鮮貨銷路農村所産之蔬菜·瓜果·禽卵·牛乳·魚介·等物，均爲城市人口之所必需，且每日不可或缺者。吾國城市，向賴鄉人之肩挑手提，以應其逐日之需要，其買賣數量旣少，生産區域亦小，往往有以價格過昂消費因而减少者，此無他，舊式之販賣與運輸方法害之也。查日本鐵路對於近郊所産之食料品，（牛乳鮮肉鮮魚介蝦野菜果物禽卵諸物）訂有特别低廉之包裹運價，故食料品得由客車輸送，而所費較普通包裹爲廉。吾國鐵路之包裹運價無此特殊待遇，似頗有仿行之價値。如運輸迅速，運費低廉，手續簡捷，則産物之稍遠者，亦可源源入市，其供給區域，不至爲鄉人肩挑之距離所限，有益於農民經濟，亦有裨於市民生活也。</p>
<h3>丁、促進運輸整聯</h3>
<p>上述之鼓勵輸出，保護國産，曁推廣銷路，種種辦法，固有賴於鐵路自身之努力，然亦有賴於各種運輸系統之聯貫，各種運輸方法之互助，否則方法雖良，組織仍不健全也，例如鐵路運價，雖已低廉，而農産遠在内地，或非鐵路所能及，輾轉輸送，仍多耗費。又如鐵路運輸設備雖已改良，而其他水陸運輸方法一仍舊貫，則所得之便利必爲之大減。至若聯運政確定，聯運方法之實施，使各種水陸運輸策之成爲一種整個的統一的組織，同進退，共存榮，則所有獎勵保護推廣之法，始能行之而無阻。此運輸整聯，當以鐵路爲領袖，從事聯絡進行。茲舉數法以供商討。</p>
<p>（一）實行沿線水陸聯運國有鐵路沿線，每多水道縱橫，農産之運入市塲，有賴於水道者，至深且巨，且往往有因鐵路運價高昂，手續繁瑣，舍鐵路用就迂廻之水道者。此種病態，由於運價者半，由於聯運之缺乏者亦半。查吾國内地江河，所行駛之船舶，種類甚多，然大致不外輪船帆船及其他小船三種，對於定期行駛之輪船，可與鐵路車站銜接者，鐵路應與之訂立貨物聯運合同，凡貨物之由輪裝車或由車裝輪，均由鐵路或輪公司代辦，無須運商自理，雙方規定行駛時刻，務求準確，便捷勝於今日迂緩之輸送，則内地農産之輸出，當能因便利省廉而增加矣。對於内河帆船小船之運輸農産者，因無訂立聯運合同之可能，然鐵路亦應爲之建築適宜之碼頭，供給起卸之設備與人力，使由船裝車，毫無困難。一面行駛定期零貨冷藏及保煖列車，以承運此種小量之農産，俾得作較遠之輸送，而拓其銷路，此雖非眞正聯運亦一廣義的聯運也。國有各路中有已實行水陸旅客聯運者，而貨物聯運尚付缺如，爲便利農産運輸計，亟應規劃進行也。</p>
<p>（二）推行鐵路與公路聯運現在吾國各地之長途汽車公司尚多，以客運爲主要營業，卽有兼營貨運者，爲數恐亦不多。然公路深入内地村鎭，實爲收集鄉間農産之利器，亟應創辦或推廣其包裹及貨運業務，從事農産之集散，俾内地産物均得便捷之運輸，以逹通都大邑，增進其效用，推廣其銷路，於路於民，均有裨益。國有鐵路中，已有與公路或長途汽車公司訂立旅客聯運合同者，今應作進一步之協商，將聯運辦法，推及包裹曁貨物業務，俾農産多一宣洩之方，而運輸多一發展之助，鐵道與公路聯成一整個之系統，其收效必不在水陸聯運下也。</p>
<p>（三）興築深入産地之路線吾國鐵路，大都限於幹線，而支綫殊少。其所經過之地，多係巨鎭大邑，未能深入鄉間，實爲農産不能發展之一大原因。觀先進國之鐵路，密如蛛網，其中幹線雖多，然網式之形成，尚多由於枝線之發逹，蓋枝線者，幹線營養之源也。鐵路沿線之無水道或公路者，無論已，卽有之，亦未必均能收集農産之任。蓋水道出於天然所經之地，未必便於農産之輸出，公路尚多以客運爲主，卽有貨運，其運輸能力，亦必薄弱，整車輸送，仍非有賴鐵路不可。况水陸聯運，雖已較不聯運爲便，然一起一落，一裝一卸，終多耗費，不如建築鐵路枝線，深入民間，從事收集，自産地以至市塲，一氣呵成之爲省廉敏捷也。故今日之已成各路，應就沿線農産主要産地，次第敷設枝線，以資聯絡吸引，使腹地農村之所出，不必輾轉搬運，一轉手間，卽可運抵目的地，省時省費，莫此爲甚，其有益於農産之分佈當亦無待言也。惟現今各路財力薄弱，借欵非易，欲一舉而興築多數之枝線，勢有難能。故爲應付目前需要起見，不妨由鐵路置備相當船隻，或興築鄉村道路，以謀銜接，從事農産品之集散，以爲幹路運輸業務之輔助，要亦權宜而有效之法也。</p>
<p>最後尚有一言爲救濟農村經濟所不可或忽者，年來農村金融枯竭，旣無餘資以改進生産，復無財力以積儲收穫，卽能告貸，亦多重利，農民生活之艱窘，由於金融之緊縮者，至深且巨。推原其故，皆因游資外流，所有借貸，又都重重間接，以致利率綦重，病民莫甚，於此返觀通都大邑，則金融停滯，宣洩無門，商業借貸，利率甚低，此種畸形之病態，終非長久之計。甚望金融業者挾其餘資，深入農村，組織各地農民借貸所，直接以低利貸欵與農民，使農民貸欵乐必假手於中間人，而受其盤剝，金融旣紓，則農産可以改良，可以輸出，并可以免臨時傾銷貶賣之虞。對於金融業者，則餘資得宣洩之所，化無用爲有用；對於運輸業者，則農産運量，可以增多，農民購買能力，可以增加；一舉而數善備，甚望各地金融業者及早圖之。</p>
<h3>華商紗廠减工問題法</h3>
<p>實施傾銷稅爲唯一救濟辦法</p>
<p>據本月二十一日大晚報載，全國八十餘紗廠，遵紗廠聯合會决議，於二十二日起，實行减工百分之二十三，卽每逢星期六·日·兩天，停開日夜工，蓋爲華紗銷路，自受外紗傾銷影響，已至山窮水盡之境，如不亟謀補救，勢必宣告破産故也。</p>
<p>夫自中外互市以前，吾國農家，男耕女織，一切衣着所需，概由自給，初不聞有何欠缺。建自外貸侵入以後，吾國家庭手工業因成本高而品質劣，不足與機製之價廉物美外貨相競爭，卽宣告完全破産，初可自織而衣者，乃不得不仰給於人。同時國人倣效外貨，設廠製造，固亦必然之事。惟近世商品競爭，貴在技術佳妙，出産巨大，成木低廉，品質優美，乃能競勝於人。吾國經濟落後，自不足與資本主義先進國家相較量，不優紗廠爲然，其他一切實業，莫不如此，故吾國紗廠自開辦以來，卽受外貨之壓迫，不僅有長足之進步，綿紗進口，固爲華紗生産之有力競爭者，而各國又利用吾國人工之低廉，原料取給之便利，復競相設廠於吾國境内，以其資本之巨大，機器之優良，人才技術之純熟，吾國紗廠難望項背，而爲所壓迫，至於襄落，自爲必然之結果。</p>
<p>世界各獨立國家對於保護其國内之實業，均有絶對之主權，而吾國則不然。以前受關稅協定之牽制，對於進口洋紗，不能自由加稅，對於國内外廠，不能加以取締，以致國貨無由保障。又以致令不一，各地厘卡林立，國紗負擔有甚於洋紗，馴致外貨益形猖獗。一九三一年二月，統稅施行，厘金廢止，自表面言之，雖云華紗仍未獲優於外紗之保護，而亦一視同仁，可免國紗負擔重於外紗之積弊。然如第十二條所列，國内製造及國外輸入之棉紗，統稅稅率，凡本色棉紗不論股數，凡在廿三支以内者每百斤徵收稅國幣二元七角五分，凡在二十三支以上者每百斤徵收統稅國幣三元七角五分。其他各類棉紗，不論股數，絲光及一切漂白或有色棉紗不論支數概從海關估價徵收統稅百分之五，誠如當時四月八日上海每日新聞所言：（日商對華商之優越地位，卽在稅率之劃分，所謂二十三支爲界限是也。中日紗廠之出品，本有粗細之界，日商分二十支爲中心，及四十二支爲中心，華商分十支及十六支爲中心，今定二十三支以下一律每百斤課二元七角半，故接近於二十三支之紗，最爲有利，極爲明瞭，華商以十支及十六支爲中心，較日商以二十支爲中心者，當立於不利條件之地位。至二十三支以上一律課三元七角半，則日商四十二支爲中心者，决無不利之點。）在華外國紗廠以日商爲中心，廠數雖無華商之多，而錠數則倍之。是統稅施行以至，反似爲外紗助長傾銷機會耳。</p>
<p>近來以日軍侵略華北，已喪失國紗之一部份市塲，近年農村經濟衰落，一般人民之購買力减退無已，華商紗廠，已感不能維持之苦，而日商因受國人抵貨之影響，不得不加甚傾銷，以維生命。華商紗廠於之益感生産過剩之壓迫，卽未停閉，乃亦不得不以减工聞矣。固也，减工乃由於生産過剩而起，然以去年而言，全國紡錠總數，不過四百五十一萬六千八百元十八枚，華商僅佔二、五八九、零四零枚，約總數之百分之五七·三一，以之供給全國人民落着之需要，不足遠甚。姑無論購買力如何衰落，亦决無生産過剩之現象發生，是知今日華商紗廠之减工，純由外紗傾銷之影響，彰彰甚明。然因外貨傾銷而引起之銷路停滯，决非减工所能解决，减工結果不僅於紗廠營業之維持，無補於事，甚且更予外貨傾銷以有利機會。吾國絲廠已奄奄一息，豈紗廠亦將步其後塵乎？</p>
<p>减工對於工人方面之影響，雖云：每星期减少三班，每一工人實際祇减少一班，一月亦祇四五班，以每班工資六角計，亦祇値二元餘之數。此實不明事理者之言也。蓋華商紗廠爲與外紗競爭，因技術及資本之不如，在在處於不利之地位，爲減少成本，易於競爭計，減輕工資，亦爲一法。是故華商紗廠工人之工資，可謂已短少至最低限度，維持最低劣之生活，常虞不繼，奚能每月再少二三元之收入？實則有大部工人，此數已爲其全部工資之半也。</p>
<p>於今日各項實業均形衰落之情勢下，吾人非過分重視華商紗廠之減工問題，然以此例彼，良以該問題乃全般問題之縮影故也。外紗傾銷，向爲吾國紡織業之大患，然絶非無法加以救濟者，月來，吾人數見政府將實施傾銷稅之消息，且有於五月一日起先以棉紗入手之說。苟如此，華商紗廠減工問題卽不難解决。所恐者，第一爲能否如期實施，抑或如民國十九年時，僅爲工商會議之議案。第二，卽外紗傾銷非限於國外進口者，國内外商紗廠實其魁首，苟傾銷稅能實施，尤須注意國内製造的外紗之傾銷，否則猶如以前之統稅，本國紗廠仍未獲其實利也。傾銷稅之施行與華商紗廠之減工，兩者適値同時發生，吾國實業之前途，觀此不難舉一反三矣。</p>

<p>自本月八日，印度立法議會，提出傾銷防止法案，印度政廳，决定廢棄一九零五年（明治卅七年）所訂日印通商條約，十二日滿塲一致通過，同時英國政府正式通告日本，依照條約規定，自聲明後六個月，最惠國待遇，完全失效。吾人檢討英國之所以出此非常手段者，表面上雖爲印度防衛日貨在法外減價傾銷的一種手段，然實際上將進而在英國内外領土内，徹底的驅逐日貨。故日本自接到廢約通告後，朝野上下，莫不相顧失色，素以占對外貿易第二位之印度，恐因此而杜絶銷路矣。查近年來日貨之傾銷海外，殆如水銀瀉地，無孔不入，故各國貿易，均受極大的打撃。其間殖民地最多之英國，影響尤大，舉凡英國一切市場，幾全爲日貨所壓倒，以致英國産業衰徵；失業日增；加以匯兌低落，日又乘此機會，猛力競爭，英以生産費關係究難與日抵衡，特棉織品一類，印度之紗廠業者與蘭加夏紗廠業者大有一落千丈之勢。迨經去年孟買紗廠聯合會詳細調查之結果，决定增加關稅，減少生産費與改良銷售制度，以爲防禦。無如日與英印兩國情形不同，各種計畫，卒難奏效。其後復提倡併用從量從價稅制定，又難防制日貨傾銷，適値本年三月日印通商條約期滿，英爲謀挽回印度與蘭加夏紗廠業之局勢，並圖順　與美國際關係，毅然廢棄條約。雖然，印度棉花羊毛等主要出産品歷來以銷售日本爲大宗，但英國以日旣脫退聯盟，忖度國際情勢，且爲實踐阿太華會議統制經濟起見，權衡利害，不得不採嚴厲手段以杜後患。蓋最近三年間日本對印貿易，頗有長足之進步，去年度日對印輸出竟超過七千六百萬元，其輸出品之主要者，多爲棉織品與絲織品，卽去年度日本棉織品之輸入印度遠八千萬元，絲織品爲三千三百萬元。（去年日對外輸出，對美爲四億四千五百萬元，對印爲二億九千萬元，對華爲一億四千萬元，）近因匯兌關係，愈形增加。英印以拘於通商條約，忍痛至今，急思廢棄舊約，以便滿期後。得課以最高率關稅，復得恢復自國之産業，實爲一舉兩得之策也。今也日因舊約之廢，新約未立，而滿期後又將受嚴酷之待遇，遂致全國市塲，頓呈混亂，舉凡紡織業以及日用品業，均因驟失銷路，恐慌異常。加以年來社會經濟，逐漸動搖，今復失此大批銷路，不得不將各項産業，收縮範圍，而收縮範圍，又不免增加失業工人，况自九一八以後，因對華銷路減少，滿擬在印度擴張局面，以補不足，詎料變起倉猝，竟予以致命的打撃，此豈日本始料所及哉？</p>
<p>不寗惟是，土耳其，亦因日貨濫賣，又通告廢棄日土通商航海條約。斐律賓亦然。而五月十五日滿期之中日互惠關稅協定，據我外交當局之意見，亦無繼續之必要。如是日貨之傾銷於東方各國，將陷於絶境矣。</p>
<p>原來現行中日條約，係根據一八九六年之中日通商航海條約與一九零三年之追加條約，該約本在一九二六年十月滿期。後因國内紛亂，爭權奪利之不及，遑論改約，於是仍照原約繼續施行。至一九二八年國民政府發生廢棄不平等條約宣言，英美德法等國，相繼與我國締結新約。獨對於中日通商條約因日方之阻撓，雙方交涉，頗感棘手，直至一九三零年五月六日，始行締結，此即今日施行之關稅協定是也</p>
<p>，查該約内容，本於最惠國待遇性質，凡由日本輸入於我國之綿織品海産物麥粉以及其他雜貨，自一九三零年五月十六日起，在三年間適用協定稅率，而此協定稅率，以一九二六年關稅爲基礎。其後至一九三一年，我國頒布國定稅率，關於協定品目中，因拘於條約，不能增高。而近年來日貨之輸入我國年逹三億元左右，至於我國之向日輸出，以原料品與半製品爲多，由經濟學原理而論，凡原料品粗製品輸出，變而爲精製品輸入，其間損失，奚止倍屣，况我國之與互惠者，又祇夏布絲綢等物，在對日輸出中，本絶少數，以此言互惠，祇見其爲偏惠耳。彼又乘我社會經濟疲敝之際，百計傾銷，以致我國産業，益呈衰頽。故此次中日關稅協定滿期，决無再行繼續之理，而旣失此東亞之二大主顧，彼國内經濟之危險，不難推想及之也。（楚玉）</p>

<h3>絲花春寒料峭蠶事不利</h3>
<p>紹興紹屬蠶汎最早、且農民均視蠶桑爲重要副業、近兩年中、因蠶事迭遭歉收、繭價又賤、蠶本大受虧蝕、故今歲飼育春蠶者祗及去歲十之七八、且因經濟關係、無資購育改良種、故均孵育土種、所育蟻量、祇及去歲百分之七十五、收蟻時氣候寒冷、收蟻不齊、大半僵　不出蟻、入後寒雨兼旬、致蠶蟻發育上大受影響、蠶病叢生、漓渚所前天樂鄉等處、早蠶已三眠開葉、奈因食雨棄、發現洩黃、安昌太平橋小江安仁鄉等處晚蠶則延不起眠、間起白僵病、損失不貲、</p>

<h3>最近婺源茶訊一束</h3>
<p>（茶葉已露青芽）婺邑茶樹、人工栽培頗勤、産量有增無减、今春以來、天寒雨雪連綿、無論山洲園茶、發育均緩、近兩旬來、天忽轉暖、晴雨順調、地沃年輕之茶樹、已露青嘴、近日晴雨乍作、芽益抽長、但因去冬今春受冷凍傷、枝頭峯露稀疎、不甚茁發、據茶户言、今歲茶産定較上年蝕欠、</p>
<p>（山户做茶無本）有茶山户、貧農居多、此輩向例至舊暦年關、向茶號領貸茶洋、以濟急用、去年茶號折本、無欵放借、間有楊枝洒潤、實杯水難救車薪、今新茶　瞬豋塲、茶户需米食物、因店舖概不賒賬、無錢購備、莫不呌苦連天、</p>
<p>（柴炭箱板落價）年來柴炭箱板、各號需要甚殷、市價隨之上漲、山農生計、恃此維持、今年各號因舊歲受虧過重、向之付欵預定者、現均停止購進、山農困於經濟、咸貶價抖銷、松柴每元一担半者、刻跌售三担、石炭每元七十斤、跌　至百四十斤、箱板每百四十元、跌售至二十元、比舊均减半價、</p>
<p>（茶棧放匯緊縮）茶棧駐婺放匯者、有洪原永·忠信昌永盛昌·源鹽潤·仁德永·升昌盛·永興隆·愼源等八家、每年放出茶欵頗巨、銀根向不愁竭、本年各棧交易初旨、放欵均主緊縮、截至現在、茶號尚無一家向棧領票、金融異常緊張</p>

<p>（茶工紛赴杭滬）本邑茶師茶工、人數綦衆、製茶手術、實較他處精研、國内茶棧茶號、俱有婺源茶工、早成爲一種專門職業、今歲杭滬土莊茶號增加、在家一般茶師茶工、連日應雇赴杭滬祁浮建工作者、不下千人、此亦失業沉悶中、突現一條新生路也、</p>

<h3>爲魯主席進一解</h3>
<p>— 天方</p>
<p>山東，眞不愧爲孔二先生的故鄉，所謂齊魯禮樂之邦，在歷史上是佔有極光榮的地位的，時至今日，我雖没有到過濟南，參謁過聖廟，也不是望氣家，但從報紙上看來，總覺得那麽一塊地方是古氣盎然，班爛可愛，除了古物的出土之外，更不斷地有（眞命天子）（救國財神）出世，地靈人傑，眞不失爲復古運動的中心。</p>
<p>大概是國難日甚的緣故吧，使古文之邦，也不得不重整旗鼓，擺設起擂台來了，而且這一次的比武中，除了眞刀眞槍以外，還廣徵（飛和簷走壁點穴）等（身懷絶技）之人，來魯獻技，據本報二十日濟市通訊說（飛簷走壁點穴諸技能，見於稗官小說唐人筆記紀載，尤多神奇，魯省定五月十四日起，舉行全省國術比賽，國術館發出通告，謂（奉主席面諭，以飛簷走壁點穴等術），爲吾國固有技能，相沿至今，漸近失傅，故此次省考，須添設此科，以倡絶學）云，猗歟盛哉。遙想（大江南北）（身懷絶技）如古之虬髯，紅線，聶隱娘，崑崙奴，以及黃天覇白玉堂之流，一定（聯袂）而來，一獻身手也，山東道上，勢將如山陰道上一様的應接不暇，猗歟盛哉！</p>
<p>慨自洋鬼子的槍砲傳入中國以後，於是舞槍弄棒之風漸殺，花花公子闖禍，好漠路打不平等等，也就少見，多威武的（拔刀相向），現在盡變爲（摸槍暗射），殺風景，國粹淪亡，有心者能不憂之。好在去古未遠，及今提倡，猶爲可及，越處女虬髯公等，雖存亡未卜，江湖奇俠傳中人物，及血滴子的餘裔，大概猶有存者，本提倡絶學之心，以爲同仇敵愾之備，使這一班（高來高去）的人，趁月黑人靜之夜，偷偷溜入敵營，只須腰間　首，這麽一揮，於是（Ｘ籐）（Ｘ籐）等人頭落地，眞如探囊取物，俗語說（擒賊擒主），這豈不是比用大刀肉搏，而殺不了敵人主將的，還來得簡便迅速，穩固可靠嗎？倘用點穴之法，使敵人個個呆若木雞，舉刀不下，舉槍不放，如（稗官小說）中所寫的那種情景，倒也可觀；而且這様一來，無辜殺傷，也就可免，更合於仁慈的本旨。我們宜預買爆竹，以爲慶賀成功之用。</p>
<p>所可惜的，是（飛簷走壁點穴）諸絶技，雖曰簡便，還須舉手動足，尚覺有點不便。案告（稗官小說）所紀載，古有雲來霧去之人，一伸指，天昏地暗，一念咒，失魂落魄，其（神奇）更在於（飛簷走壁點穴）諸絶技之上，見於西遊記封神傳中頗不乏人，而其失傳也，不祗（漸近），倘主席大老爺能多備（香燭）奬品川資膳宿均無庸虔誠叩請，或許天可見憐，招得一二孫悟空二郎神之流下降，那時只須金棒一揮，神獒一吠，眼見得之鳥盡成華粉，七千萬倭寇盡入狗腹，豈不是尤其直捷了當。以視武力抵抗，誠屬多事，飛簷走壁，亦有遜色。誠爲抗日救國第一上策，濟南去泰山甚近，寄語主席，還是登日觀之峯，上叩蒼穹，遣不拘那一位天神天將下凡，以挽國運。至誠可以格天，能如且做，一定有意想不到之效力，我們且拭眼恭候着哩！</p>

<h3>電木</h3>
<p>— 寰</p>
<p>在大公司的櫉窗裏，在城隍廟的　子上，我們可以看到新近才有的紅紅綠綠以及各色美麗的杯，碟，盆等用具，牠的質如木，很輕，普通稱之電木，　　現在新出的電木用具慢慢地多了，在没有認識牠以前，許多人對懷疑，不敢嘗試，所以我有作此文之必要，</p>
<p>牠是不一種天然産物所做成的，而是一種化學品，比（賽璐璐）柔靭而經久耐用：不着火：不溶化；不溶解於任何溶劑中：雖與稀琉酸一塊兒煑而能不起作用；最好的性質，牠是不傳電的，假使木或金屬的器具浸入牠的溶淞中，能起一層光亮而美麗的薄膜，如油漆一般，且能保護木的腐壞和金屬的生鐫，牠的製造法如下：（一）２ＣＨ３ＯＨ＋Ｏ２＝２ＣＨ２Ｏ＋２Ｈ２Ｏ（水）（火酒）（養氣）（福爾馬林）（ＦＯＲＭＡＬＩＮ）（二）福爾馬林＋石炭酸＝電木（ＰＨＥＮ６）（以阿摩尼亞爲觸煤）電木剛做好的時候是一種膠狀物質，這種東西可以溶解於酒精，丙酮（ＡＣＥＴＯＮＥ）等溶液中；但熱此物質至攝氏一百度或華氏二百十二度時，變成一種堅硬和松香一般的固體，這就是現在所稱的電木</p>
<p>牠最大的用途是在電氣工業中，開關，紙緣器等物件均可代橡皮；因牠的彈性同象牙差不多，所以可做彈子；因牠的價廉物美，鈕扣，傘柄，刀柄，揑手等東西都可用牠代替象牙，賽璐璐，橡皮的用途，</p>
<h3>生路在那裏？</h3>
<p>— 匡貝</p>
<p>時候已是黃昏了，燈還没有上，他方君每在迷糊的暮色裏，站立階前，郊野，目瞪神呆的凝視着東邊斜插過的那條大道，興起了離鄉背井到上海去謀生的念頭</p>
<p>ＸＸＸ　　當他五年前在縣城師範裏唸書，即已深深的感到城市生活的浮囂的可惡，想要矯正這種歪曲的社會病態，只有回到農村裏去·而况社會的繁榮，原　建築在農村上·這是他的自勗勗人的超常見解與抱負·因爲他是師範出身，一回鄉，也就踏進了小學教師的生活圈子，他自已原也不曾作過什麽分外的希冀。</p>
<p>那時，他的鄉雖不是什麽（模範村）</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>，（世界桃源），却也是自給自足，習俗淳厚的一片凈土·其後漸漸的有些異様了，但他爲了死心想替社會掙扎，想替自已的生命掙扎，他不曾灰冷過心，疏怠過職務。</p>
<p>這是最近的心情，他屢屢感到心頭好像壓下了無示掀開的重石，每於課餘的黃昏時節，在階前或在郊野閒踱，總免不掉這麽一些感嘆：</p>
<p>昔年遍地田隴，塘坑，山坡，都是栽植的所在，這就使他得了一個新的發現所以昔年糧食便宜，所以昔年的農民生活豐裕·現在呢，只見成塊的荒地，没人耕種，好像大家都不在乎操作了·</p>
<p>昔年遍山都是樹木葱籠，而今都是童山濯濯·</p>
<p>最是昔年西邊的百家冲，眞是名副其實，多少熱閙，每當黃昏時候，家家的屋頂烟囱裏冒出團團旋的濃烟，迎着薰和的南風，漸漸匯成稀薄的雲霧似的向北方遠遠的散開，裏面好像混含有無限的鄉村閒情，人生喜悅·而今呢，所謂百家的屋子，泰半坍倒了，只見斷垣破瓦的堆積上，叢生着野草，苔蘚，團旋的冒烟，自然也是零落落，没有匯合着向西方飄去的閒情景象了·</p>
<p>他望着，他回想着，心頭又湧現了另一副景片：</p>
<p>前年的水災，淹𣹐了全冲的土地，去年匪刦之餘，又惹得大批的兵勇臨鄉坐鎭，更額外多吃去了不少的糧食，最是這批開走，那批又開來弄得人心皇皇，個個不安，有的更丢棄家小，跟了前去，於是村上的壯丁稀少了·婦人也只管蕩來蕩去的嬉游，那管得下田家大事</p>
<p>他想著這些那些，來龍去水，就好像自已過去在翻觔斗的序幕，都與這些社會事實相印證·眼見自已也臨了災難的境界，教書生活一年不比一年了·</p>
<p>ＸＸＸ</p>
<p>據說上海是黃金之地，他每在迷糊的暮色裏，站在階前，郊野，目瞪神呆的凝視着東邊斜插過的那條大道，興起了離鄉背井到上海去謀生的念頭：</p>
<p>但據說到了上海的人，又是十個有九個失業，飢餓，凍餒，終至自殺，没有下場·</p>

<h3>提倡小調救國</h3>
<p>— 厚英</p>
<p>自從國難以來，我們中國的救國方法，正如雨後春筍一般，琳琅滿目，其中當然也有許多是理正言順的；但是我以爲這些救國方法，除了智識階級中的人外，就怕不能發生多大的效力了。可是我們中國的智識階級，說起來眞也可憐，一百人中間，不知道有没有十個人；較之鳳毛麟角，簡直有些差不多了。所以，要在這個教育不普遍的國中收得圓滿的救國結果者，只有先使一般人民感覺得（國家的艱難，敵人的橫暴）之後，方能有效。</p>
<p>小調，在我國的平民社會中，可算是最有力，最活躍的宣傳品了。你在無論何處甚至於鄉僻小村；當一班人民工作後休息的時候，你便可以聽見他們郎呀郎，姐呀姐，一起一落的唱着。他們雖然是不識字，但是這種小調的流行力却非常之大：因爲其中的字句俚俗，聲調着韻，所以他們學起來旣覺便利，唱起來又覺好聽，就此能夠一傳兩，兩傳三的不脛而走了。</p>
<p>現在。我以爲應該先編一種富有愛國思想，以及宣傳敵人兇暴，殘殺同胞的小調出來。但，第一：字句間須要力求普通；第二：語氣不可不順。這様久而久之，使他們對於國家和敵人，都有一個相當的認識了；那時，再提出上項的救國方法，我想至少總要比現在的成績稍爲好些吧！</p>
<h3>關於街頭的流浪兒</h3>
<p>— 人</p>
<p>當你經過小沙渡路要到愛文義路去候電車，或是走上麥特赫司脫路的一段，這時候會有些衣襟襤褸，面黃飢瘦的孩子向你磕頭作揖，伸手喊着（發財老　給我一個銅板：）當你坐在一輛黃包車上而要經過四川路橋到老靶子路去的時候，你的車夫彎着腰，掙扎着拚死力向橋上慢慢的拉，這時斜地裏會闖出三五個臉上塗滿了煤灰，衣褲破得像戲台上古裝英雄的盔甲，背脊枯得像乾柴般的浪兒來帮助你的車夫拉車，拉上了橋，就伸手向你（先生一隻銅板小意思）。當你每次走路或過橋而碰着這些從來不知（家）在何處的街頭流浪兒，有時或許你會發出些許民惻隱之心而解開錢袋丢兩個子兒給他們，有時你也會覺得厭煩而吆喝一聲，他們便嚇得作鳥獸般的散了。關於這様的事，上海人而有走路或坐車過橋的經騐，他們都曾（解袋給子）或是（吆喝）過，不過他們隨給隨忘，喝一聲以後就無其事了，所以根本就没有在他們的腦子裏留着一些糢糊印像，也從没想到這兩個銅子是給他買一頓飯吃，或是度兩天生活。久而久之，他們仍然在走路，在坐車，在過橋，而那伸手喊（發財老　）（先生小意思）的流浪的一羣還是依然在過着無家可歸的流浪，乞求，甚至於偷竊的生活。</p>
<p>在（生路）裏，它介紹我們，蘇聯在五年計畫之始，也同様在街頭流浪着一大羣没有家歸的孩童，他們天天在馬路上行乞，偷竊，過路的人，深深地引以爲麻煩頭疼，都說這班小　三是天生的壞胚子　無法可想絶没希望的野東西：但是　事實呢，它咬釘截鐵地告訴我們這班可憐的孩子天生來並不壞而且是最聰明最能幹最可以耗勞的生産者，只要有一個人來教導指揮他們就行了。在前不幾天報上載着，蘇聯又在開始撲滅這將近十萬的無家可歸漂泊的兒童了！他們預備了一萬三千七百萬盧布來花在這班從没人注意的（小　三）身上，他們建造了許許多多（兒童家）及（兒童感化院，）把（小瘪三）們聚集起來，拿飯給他們吃，教育給他們受，又授以職業，於是他們便能而且會耕地，經商，做工，甚至於做出優美的照相機來！這是如何驚人而偉大的事情啊！</p>
<p>這黃髮碧眼的流浪的一羣，現在已經得救了，我們的小沙渡路，四川路橋，以及於全上海，全中國的這不幸的一羣呢？可憐啊，他們還不是没有在大人先生的腦子裏留有些許糢糊的影子！？雖說他們也曾經給大人先生們（吆喝）過，或是在馬路上拾過大人先生因些許的惻隱而解錢袋丢給他們的兩過銅子。</p>
<p>店員通訊</p>
<h3>不成體統</h3>
<p>編者先生：我們這裏，常常有廠家送様品來；照例這種様品，是分給店員的，有時或者經理先生一個人拿去，前幾天，又有一家廠家，送了幾件様品來；當時我和某君，各人都取了一件。不料拿到門口，將要出去的時候；被經理看見了，結果竟被他奪去。</p>
<p>先生，這様品根本没有寫明何人可取的呀！爲什麽他就可這様對付我們呢？請你解釋！此請屠挺梅啓</p>
<p>Ｘ　　　Ｘ　　　Ｘ　　　Ｘ</p>
<p>編者按：這件事情，似乎很小；但是我們知道，牠在中國商店裏，很普徧化，所以特地拿出來公開談談。</p>
<p>人家送様品來的意思，是要呌你們加以指教，或代爲推銷；所以收到了様品，應當由經理以下圖店的人大家傳觀批評，好的代他推銷，不好的，也要將其缺點，告訴原廠家，設法改良。要是來了之後，就你搶我奪的分了，實在是不對的。</p>
<p>講到没有寫明何人可取，那没當然寄給店裏的。不要說小職員不能取，經理也不能取。即使店東不要這意外之物，也應當聚在一起，到節邊公平分配才是道理。</p>

<h3>夢裏光陰（三十五續）</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>（最吃緊的是明天你怎様去對付他們的學生會！）劉女士已不再怪怨她的丈夫了，她是在替他的地位担憂。</p>
<p>（我已把辭呈送給Ｘ部長了！）伍逸爽快把通盤的事實，完全傾吐出來。（啊！你這個犠牲似乎太過分了一些吧）劉女士很失望嗟嘆着。（爸爸！你今天這一番處置，使我痛心極了）！伍源突然把身子跳到了門的旁邊去，很激昂地說道：（你旣然不能再維持你的光榮的地位，我也没有臉再在南京逗留了！）</p>
<p>做兒子的向老子說出了這様的話來，未免太荒謬了，伍逸也不由大吃一驚（這是什麽話）？</p>
<p>（我馬上要走了？我决意加入義勇軍的隊伍去）！在校裹，伍源已曾受過許多同學的譏諷，兩重的剌激，便把他的混身的鮮血全煑沸了：他很有力地拉開了短門，返身便走，他也不曾和他老子道别，祗送了一個白眼給他。</p>
<p>（源兒！源兒！你瘋了嗎）？劉女士忘命的趕將出去。可是慈母的心，已挽不回這一個青年人的堅志，他的腿搬得像飛一般的快，祇幾步早衝出了大門去了。（源兒！源兒！）劉女士底帶着酸音的長號，給尖悄的西風送進來，在伍逸的耳邊　廻着，使他立刻像隔斷了空氣一般，呼吸逐漸短促，血不住的望上升，臉漲得比喝醉了酒更紅，眼前的景物，漸漸糢糊，在他的小兒子伍豪趕過來扶　他之前，他已在温暖的地氈上昏過去了。噴出來的血，染紅了氈上，織就的一頭孤雁。</p>
<p>（十五）救國協會</p>
<p>救國！救國！一片熱烈而動聽的呼聲，像夏天時候青草池塘畔的蛙聲一般地在各處振喧着，如果照揮汗成雨，呼氣成雲的比例算起來，這様一番驚天動地的大閙，似乎已很夠嚇死本莊繁，驚倒荒木了：無奈日本小鬼，他媽的，胆子眞大，任你們喊得怎様上勁，他們祇當是馬路上的小熱昏在唱山歌，誰也不曾注意，反格外有興地調兵遣將，殺奔前來，分明是存心要你出醜這時候要如換了太平洋西岸的花旗大老班，或是歐洲大陸的法蘭西大少爺，少不得就要濁氣一湧，不管三七二十一的跟日本小鬼拼一下了，事情當然就閙大了！還好，中國人是出名的量大福大，萬事不肯認眞，政府方面旣老是鎭靜得像隔河觀火一般，百姓方面，也祇當是長城一帶在開中日對抗的足球賽，每天　多買一份夜報看：便撤開手完事！</p>
<p>（電影救國，跳舞救國，嫖堂子救國，跑馬救國，賣屁····）新聞記者在報紙上很悲傷地譏諷着。不料這様一來，倒使那些摩登的少爺們，小姐們，反有了（聊以解嘲）底藉口，老實不客氣竟逐件的搬演起來，新聞記者又怎様奈何了他們？</p>

<h3>葛雷泰嘉寳之家庭</h3>
<p>— 竹仙</p>
<p>（其母不願聞女名）</p>
<p>（似有難言之隱在）</p>
<p>葛雷泰嘉寳，本不姓嘉寳而姓格斯泰芙孫（ＧＮＳＴＡＶＳＳＯＮ）上次已略言之。論到嘉寳身世，知者甚少。嘉寳自身亦矢口不言，所以頗多隱秘之處。現外間新知者，爲嘉寳之父及姊，均已去世。現存在者，有一母一兄，均居瑞典都城斯篤克霍姆。其兄業剪報，頗能以資自給。聞其面貌與嘉寳頗有酷似處。現所欲言而尤堪注意者，爲其母。</p>
<p>嘉寳之母，身體肥碩，爲人極和藹可親。美國某記者，年前曾道過瑞京，因慕嘉寳之名，遂順道往訪其母。當初接談時，除去寒喧之外，兼及瑞典之天氣，瑞京風景等等。格斯泰芙孫夫人頗善談，娓娓不倦。該記者於是漸言及其母葛雷泰，以爲其母聞人道及其女，必欣欣然道其兒時之梗概也。不意事有出乎常人意料之外者，其母聞其女名，顔色立變，態度亦不若前之和順。該記者見勢不佳，卽停止涉及其女之談話，但其母至終未能恢復談話開始時之親善狀態云。事後該記者詢之旁人，則其母固絶對不談其女之事，亦惡聞人道及其女。雖其女已享盛名，護巨資，亦與之絶少來往云。此事絶怪，不似其母故作隱秘而成其女之别一風格。或者母女之間，有不可能之意見存在，但無人能道其究竟也。近嘉寳返國後，朋友間往來甚頻，而對於家庭，反絶少存問。此事頗可以證明後者之說爲不謬也。</p>
<p>以嘉寳在美國好萊塢所享之盛名而言，彼在瑞典本國似必大受人之歡迎矣。而事實上亦有不然者。聞瑞典人對於嘉寳之感情，頗不佳。嘉寳所演之影片，在美聶動一時者，在瑞典則從未爲人十分稱道過。在瑞典國内。琴尼麥唐納之名遠在嘉寳之上。琴妮之（旋宮艶史）在瑞京某大戲院連演十五星期，天天滿座。而嘉寳與約翰吉爾勃合演之鉅片ＡＷＯＭＡＮＯＦＡＦＡＩＲＳ僅僅賣座五天，就不能支持之，聞嘉寳此次返瑞以後，國内對彼感情已較前增進。而瑞典國内與論對嘉寳最不滿意之時，即爲去歲美國落杉磯舉行奥林匹克世界大運動會時。今略紀其梗概如下　　當奥林匹克運動會舉行之時，全球大小各國均有選舉派送參加。好萊塢諸明星以運動塲，近在咫尺，都曲意承　，招持各國選手。瑞典隊到美時，衆意葛雷泰嘉寳自必竭誠招待其國人矣。不意嘉寳孤僻性成，將此事置諸度外。於是消息傅至本國，輿論對於嘉寳遂大肆攻撃。且事猶不僅此區區？綠瑞典選手中有馬球一隊，隊員均瑞典國中貴胃子弟，其領袖爲一老年公爵。一日，該公爵於游騁之際，遇嘉寳於途。公爵紓尊與之握手，嘉寳雖貌頗恭順，惟迨公爵建議，欲呼衆隊員出爲嘉寳一一介紹，嘉寳卽猛鞭其馬，絶塵而去。事後公爵歸告諸　　少年，諸少年均笑謂（她不在乎誰在乎？）於是國内輿論對於出身寒微之女演員，益壤至極點。據云嘉寳種怪僻行爲，均是其經紀人哈雷愛丁登所主張，以迎合美國人士嘉寳新好奇之心理者。今愛丁登已離職他去，此後嘉寳之行經，當不至再如以前之孤芳自賞矣。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評（謀財賈禍）</h3>
<p>— 思蘋</p>
<p>（謀財賈禍）是一部平常得很的描寫家庭悲劇的影片。全片的故事雖則尚屬可取，但因爲没有深刻的襯托和曲折的穿插，更没有精緻的佈景和驚動的音樂，所以演出未免太單調了；而其中突如其來的情節，硬拚雜凑，使這影片不能十分自然和逼眞了。</p>
<p>這張片子差不多完全以一個家庭爲背景，叙述這一家之主，在倫敦銀行做行員，收入不豐，遂使這家庭入敷出，負債纍纍，其自身及其妻女遂痛感着貧窮的悲哀。賢慧的家主婦的微弱的力量也無法使一家數口安貧茹苦，負一家禍福之責的主人，遂由不能安貧的一念之差，妄想投機致富，卒因挪用行欵而致失業。接着便是謀財害命，利用不義之財居然投機成了富翁，然而良心上的道德終是逃不了。有了錢之後便接着被色慾誘惑。其女瞥見父親同外婦不正當的行爲，傳染了墮落的醜態，也就不免墮落了。其妻也服毒自殺，而自身便也陷入囹圄。</p>
<p>這部電片的英文原名是ＰＡＹＭＥＮＴＤＥＦＥＲＥＢ所以根據其情節，如其譯爲（謀財賈禍）不如譯爲（報應不爽），與片名各劇情比較的兩不失眞。</p>
<p>這張片子的導演過於死守着劇本的故事，不能放開去之後再收籠來，所以不能發揮出多大的精彩。其背影幾於完全集中在一個家庭，其簡單的波折十分之九借對白傳出，因之在貧苦的時候，只有夫妻二個及一個女兒間面部的表情同言語的訴苦，暴富之後，社會上對這不清白的富翁也没有深刻譏諷的趨炎附勢的描寫，有錢的姪子從澳洲初次來到之後，第一次見面的時候便誘其做投機事業向其借貸，借貸不成便馬上把其毒死，未免太突兀了。</p>
<p>全部演員四五人，劇中比較重要的角色不過三個人，没有特出的人材，不過表演得也還不使人討厭。</p>
<h3>評（情謊）（ＬＯＶＥＬＩＥＳ）</h3>
<p>— 星</p>
<p>在中國市塲裏銷路停滯了四五年的英國影片，近來的確活躍得多了。也許是英國的影片商看出了自已的缺點，和好萊塢成功的原因，所以近來也盡力傾向于喜劇方面了，萬國公司更是最努力的一家。</p>
<p>然而無論如何，英國的喜劇滑稽片仍舊是失敗的居多，卽以昨天卡爾豋所映的（情謊）ＬＯＶＥＬＩＥＳ而論，亦復不能見佳。</p>
<p>這一部影片的本事，說起來太長了，而且是一無所有的幻影，只是兩對情人，意欲結婚，而爲這兩個少年的叔父，種種作梗，以致好事多磨。但結果這四個有情人，都成眷屬。</p>
<p>導演是盧璧諾籃ＬＵＰＩＮＯＬＡＮＥ所謂因飾（璇宮艶史）侍者而成名的，他的表演雖是不錯，但他的導演眞不高明。全片組織也非常牽强，一首一尾，先以鬥牛塲全景，末以滿堂子女，這種筆法，也許算不大看見的了。因爲這種都是五六年前的時髦品。中間的一些，也多數是落伍的。</p>
<p>演員差不多是三星期前演（糊塗親家）裏的全班人馬，最重要的是史丹盧壁諾ＳＴＡＮＬＥＹＬＵＰＩＮＯ他那天生的一副　　面孔，表演也不算錯。次要的，是他老搭擋傑克霍勃斯ＪＳＣＫＨＯＢＢＳ演戲有餘，生色則不足，其餘的五個配角，竟呌人没法去品評他們的藝術，側撃的一點笑料，也顯生硬。</p>
<h3>天一建游泳池</h3>
<p>— 培元</p>
<p>天一公司除有俱樂部的設備外，關於運動方面的各項器具，設置亦很完備。邇來天氣已漸轉熱，夏日瞬將臨到，我們知道暑天最好的運動，莫過於游泳一項，故每届夏季，凡公衆之游泳池，仕女莫不　　。天一公司老板邵醉翁有鑒於此，近特將該公司攝影塲前的原有之小池，改作爲小規模的游泳池，四週并栽植各種樹木花草，昨天午後已開始動工，該公司職工人員皆全體總動員工作，陳玉梅女士亦與大衆荷鋤工作，邵醉翁在旁指導，預料二三月後可以完成，我想此風一起，各公司也許皆將仿效矣。</p>
<p>攝影平常，絲毫没有美感。光線也至算多一個不反常。分幕大致還好，但是攝影場上的缺點，不是黑屋子裹剪接所能補救的，穿插是滑稽片的靈魂，然而這裏，穿插就是本劇，本劇完全由若干穿插組成的，也談不到好。對白極多，但是可笑的句子，也數不勝數，並且略插西班牙話和法文，别有風趣。可惜除說話時的表情，可以一笑外，對白中的笑料，絶不是中國人所歡迎的。發音還好，至于這影片中不合理的一切，也不細說了。</p>
<p>此外有兩本副片，却非說一下不可，牠是（技術類短片，）也可以算科學片。從一八三一年，歐州創造人翼，成了飛機的模型起，到一九三二年，最新式陸上海上飛機止，將一百年來，飛機的改革，演進，雖然粗枝大葉，却是言人所未言的。從這短短二千尺影片中，可以看出歐美人對于航空的研究，是多麽努力。目下航空救國的呼聲，風起雲湧，在國難中的中國人，對於這種極爲興趣而富有興奮劑的二本副片倒是很値得一看的。</p>
<h3>對於電影批評家的忠告</h3>
<p>— 紹谷</p>
<p>許多的電影批評家，因爲愛護國産影片的熱忱，有時未免期望太奢。一張比較有意義的片子，他們總是要吹毛求疵，攻撃得他體無完膚。他們不曾想一想，這些影片公司的歷史，並不算悠久，經濟也不很充裕，至於那些位編劇者和導演者，也都不是什麽著名的文學家，當然不會一點糼穉病没有的。况且有些位批評家的觀點，也並不見得怎様正確，</p>
<p>總之近來的影片公司能夠毅然棄去一切無聊的低級趣味的作品，從事於比較前進些，略有意義些的作品，是値得我們觀衆欽佩的。最後我尤其希望一般批評家，不可以各自袒護某一公司的出品，而肆意毁謗别一家的製作。請放棄了政客們黨同伐異的手腕，而作一個國産影片的忠實同志。</p>
<h3>羣星會萃的（脂粉市塲）</h3>
<p>— 白文</p>
<p>最近好萊塢攝製影片，往往集合多數有名的明足在一起，再利用一種較好的劇本，來吸引觀衆。這方法當然能得到很大的成效的，例如米高梅的（大飯店），和新近在本埠公映的福克斯的（賽珍會），都是聶動一時的片子。</p>
<p>明星公司新近攝製了一部有聲片（脂粉市塲），便採用了上述一種吸引觀衆的方法。據說劇本的編者就是編（狂流）的丁謙平君，題材是關於婦女職業問題的，以百貨公司的商塲爲背景。因爲劇本的故事意識都很好，公司方面頗想藉此聶動一下。導演是張石川而諸已經支配定當的演員，尤其人才躋躋，差不多都星平常單獨主演的明星，這裏値得介紹的是：有胡蝶，胡萍，文霞，嚴月閒，龔稼農，王獻齋，孫敏等等。</p>
<p>看了這幾個演員的名單，我們可以想得見（脂粉市塲）的號召力量，大概不會很小吧？</p>

<h3>電影小說忠魂錄ＣＡＶＡＬＣＡＣＬＥ（六）</h3>
<p>— 訥</p>
<p>流光易逝，愛德華已是成人，喬易亦已進衣頓大學。那時英倫全地盛行一種戀歌，呌做ＢＥＳＩＤＥＴＨＥＳＥＡＳＩＤＥ。愛德華和　蒂絲正在青春纞愛的過程中，而這隻戀歌，不啻是爲他們二人歌詠的，所以琪茵的腦筋中，亦不覺歌詞的俚俗，轉覺其美妙了。有一天喬易攙了他的母親在海邊上散着步，聞地裹又遇見了繁尼。她越出落得如出水芙葉一様，媚人的笑　，紅紅的頭髮，碧藍似海水的雙瞳，身體已發逹了，充滿着蓬蓬勃勃的生氣。喬易瞪了兩隻大眼，好似看不够似的。琪茵看見了繁妮，恢復了昔日心情，心中好似愛倫並没有離開她一様，覺得心中千言萬語一時說不出來。</p>
<p>這時愛德華和藹蒂絲一對情人，坐在海邊上一隻翻身的破船上（這是伏線）閒談着，逗弄着。忽然藹蒂絲看見海天遠處一隻大輪船，她指着那船向愛德華道，（我很想到那隻船上去玩玩，你願意不願意？）愛德華心房跳得極厲地說：（我們一塊兒？）這時的愛德華已深深浸在愛情之中，但這是二十世紀了，講愛情須要裝些隨隨便便的様子；而藹蒂絲心房跳躍得還要厲害，她亦裝出一副隨隨便便的様子。她說：（恐怕是的。）愛德華就此一步緊上步地，說到相愛上面，提到坐了那隻大船去度蜜月。兩人越偎越近，一直到他們摟抱，接吻，定情，都在那一霎時之間完成了他們二人日夜夢魂顛倒的志願。</p>
<p>愛德華和藹蒂絲訂婚以後，日中則形影相隨，夜中則千思萬想。但是不久他們結婚了，上了那隻大船，這是她的處女航，他們一同到美國去度蜜月的。他們已快活到極頂，但是因愛生懼，他們懷疑起來，尤其是藹蒂絲，她總怕將來愛德華一旦離開她，或者一天呌他，她不答應了。這時他們坐在甲板上，她的頭放於愛德華的肩膀上，手攙着手。她心中越想越怕起來，她想着（這種美景良辰大好了，但是爲歡幾何？彩雲易散，月圓則缺，天下事大抵如此）。她想到此處，不覺說出很奇怪的一種話來，她說：（倘使現在來了一個鬼魔，向我們說（你們要將大西洋中的魚，數得清清楚楚；不然，你們今天晚上就死。）那怎麽様呢？）</p>
<p>（那我們就死！）愛德華向着她笑起來了，但是藹蒂絲不能回答他的笑。她僅僅問了一聲：（死，你怕不怕？）愛德華說：（我不知道，恐怕到那個時候，要怕的。）藹蒂絲說：（我不怕，你想想，我們這個時候是我們畢生最快活的一回兒。死不是最可怕的東西。倘使將來你不和我同在，那才可怕呢。）</p>

<h3>Our Army's Full-Scale Counterattack on the West Bank of the Luan River</h3>
<p>He's Troops Advance to the Line from Tuanshan to Dachengshan</p>
<p>Lulong and Qian'an are Both Recovered</p>
<p>Enemy Forces are Largely Concentrated in Changli and Luan County, Situation is Uneasy</p>
<p>(Luanzhou) The various armies on the west bank of the Luan River launched a full-scale counterattack on the afternoon of the 23rd. He Zhuguo's army, the Shi Tian two regiments, after fierce fighting, advanced to the line from Tuanshan to Dachengshan around 9 PM tonight. The enemy retreated towards Anshan, and our army is currently in hot pursuit. On the main front, one regiment of Weng Zhaoyuan's division of the Wang's army forcibly crossed the river from Caijiafen, and another regiment from the northwest of Lulong, encircling the city of Lu. After several rounds of bayonet charges, a certain battalion took the lead in entering the city at 10 PM. The Li division of the Shang army also defeated the enemy in front of them, and the division has now recovered the county seat of Qian'an. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Shang Zhen telegraphed from Kaiping this afternoon, stating that the enemy occupying Wangya, north of Qian'an city, on the 21st, attempted to launch a surprise attack on our army under cover of artillery fire. Our army met the attack head-on and also launched a part of the army crossed the river near Qian'an County to attack the enemy's flank. The enemy retreated in panic, and a certain regiment of our army then occupied Qian'an County. Currently, while pacifying the merchants and civilians, they are pursuing the enemy towards Jianchangying. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Shang Zhen arrived in Kaiping at 6:30 AM this morning and immediately went to the front line for inspection. He Zhuguo's special train entered Luan County last night and stopped at Luan County Station. He is now inspecting the defense line at [unclear]. Most of the enemy forces are now concentrated in Changli. After the Japanese and puppet troops occupied Changli, the Changli County Magistrate fled. The Japanese side appointed Xu Wanliang, the principal of Changli Huiwen Middle School, as the Changli County Magistrate. The situation in Luan County is extremely uneasy. All pawnshops in Luan County are flying American flags. Residents in the city and countryside are pawning their clothing, and the pawnshops are running out of space. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Song Pangtong Arrives at the Front to Command</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Zunhua telegraphs, Song Pangtong has arrived at the front to command. Our army's positions around Saheqiao and the North and South Tuan Ting are consolidated. The war situation is calm.

<h3>Expanded Scope of Anglo-American Economic Discussions After US Abandonment of Gold Standard</h3>
<p>Roosevelt and MacDonald Share Many Views</p>
<p>Method of Restoring the Gold Standard Left to Experts for Research</p>
<p>France Also Focuses on Stabilizing Finance and Resolving War Debts</p>
<p>Nationalist News Agency Washington 22nd dispatch. US President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister MacDonald initially only intended to have an informal discussion of world issues, but the result of today's talks has become a general conference on Anglo-American economics. According to a statement issued by the White House after the talks, the two have agreed to submit many technical issues to Anglo-American experts for discussion. Experts from the two countries will begin work this afternoon, while the President and Prime Minister will continue their talks. Since the United States abandoned the gold standard, it has greatly expanded the scope of discussion, and it is necessary to have a more formal meeting of economic experts and consultants.</p>
<h3>Experts Jointly Study</h3>
<p>It is reported that during the talks at the White House today, Roosevelt summarized what he considered to be the important economic issues currently facing the United States and the United Kingdom, and MacDonald also expressed his views. As a result, the two had many points of complete agreement, but felt that each economic issue must be studied by experts. Currently, British Ambassador Lindsay and US Secretary of State Hull are meeting with experts, and US Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman, State Department economic expert Feis, and Philip, who investigated the European economic situation on behalf of the President, are also attending the expert meeting.</p>
<h3>Anglo-American Understanding is Expected</h3>
<p>As for the details of Roosevelt and MacDonald's talks, the White House is still not releasing them as usual, but everyone in Washington firmly believes that the issues submitted to experts for research must be the restoration of the gold standard by the United States and the United Kingdom and its implementation methods. At this time, all major economic issues are still the goals of the talks between the two leaders and are being discussed. It is reported that tomorrow the two may take the President's yacht together, depart in the early morning, and cruise along the Potomac River for a candid conversation. It is expected that by tomorrow night, they will be able to reach an understanding on the positions that the United States and the United Kingdom will take at the World Economic Conference. This is clearly the purpose of this discussion, while mutual understanding on financial issues is secondary. Therefore, all the issues at the World Economic Conference will be discussed this time. However, the current financial situation in the United States will cause changes in the trend of discussions at the World Economic Conference in the future.</p>
<h3>World Economic Problems</h3>
<p>Reuters Washington 22nd Dispatch. The weekend meeting between British Prime Minister MacDonald and US President Roosevelt began this morning at 11 o'clock in the conference room of the White House overlooking the Potomac River. Those participating in the meeting included Secretary of State Hull and British Ambassador Lindsay, and the advisors to the US President and British Prime Minister also participated. The war debt issue was raised for discussion, but the US President has so far only spoken in terms of the overall international situation. The US President believes that if the reserve requirements for various currencies are reduced, the issuance of currency can be increased, and the result can raise prices everywhere. It is generally expected that the United States and the United Kingdom may not have a concrete agreement on currency, but a (gentleman's agreement) may be established. After the meeting this morning, the two sides issued a joint statement, stating that the talks adjourned at 12:45, and the two sides considered the main issues of the World Economic Conference and agreed to submit these issues to experts for research first. Experts are scheduled to begin discussions this afternoon.</p>
<h3>Intention of Abandoning Gold Standard</h3>
<p>Nationalist News Agency Washington 22nd Dispatch. The United States' currency inflation war today seems to be entirely a domestic affair within the country, purely a domestic policy issue. Secretary of State Hull today notified the ambassadors stationed in the four countries of Britain, France, Germany and Italy that the abandonment of the gold standard this time is purely to cope with the domestic environment and increase world prices, and there is absolutely no intention to use it as an international negotiating weapon, and instructed them to convey this intention to the governments of the countries they are stationed in.</p>
<h3>MacDonald Advocates Cooperation</h3>
<p>Reuters Washington 22nd Dispatch. British Prime Minister MacDonald broadcast on the radio from the National Press Club at lunchtime, stating that the United States' abandonment of the gold standard has created a very complicated situation, but this is unavoidable, and no one can be blamed. Countries should unite to deal with this common problem, and Britain does not want to adopt retaliatory policies. After lunch, the British Prime Minister returned to the White House to continue talks with President Roosevelt.</p>
<p>Reuters London 22nd Dispatch. British Prime Minister MacDonald arrived in Washington last night and received an extremely friendly welcome. The purpose of his visit has been published in an article released to news reporters. He said, "President Roosevelt invited me to visit this country in the capacity of British Prime Minister and Chairman of the World Economic Conference, and to study the difficult problems we need to deal with. I accepted this invitation because I believe that the United Kingdom and the United States are consistent in spirit on the world's major issues, and both recognize that the current urgent task is to eliminate the economic difficulties we are currently encountering. We must work to clear the obstacles blocking our domestic and international commercial thoroughfares, and restore the hope that millions of unemployed people can find their place. I hope to exchange views with President Roosevelt on economic and political issues. Although in the short time we have, it is of course impossible to have the hope of establishing a concrete agreement that is also related to other countries, we must open up a path for consistent action. I believe that my meeting with the US President is a key to achieving this goal."</p>
<h3>Herriot Arrives in New York</h3>
<p>Reuters New York 23rd Dispatch. Former French Prime Minister Herriot, who is now representing France at the Washington Conference, arrived here today aboard the France, and immediately set off for Washington.</p>
<p>Nationalist News Agency Washington 22nd Dispatch. According to wireless telegraph reports from the Ile de France liner, Herriot wants to ask the United States to extend the period of suspension of war debt payments, so that he can ask France to compensate for the war debts due in mid-December.</p>
<h3>French Policy Determined</h3>
<p>Reuters Paris 22nd Dispatch. Herriot, the French representative participating in the Washington preparatory meeting, will largely abandon the position of an extreme bystander. France believes that there will be a duel between the dollar and the pound, and Herriot can be expected to watch from the sidelines. The French cabinet convened a meeting this morning dedicated to discussing the monetary situation. After the meeting, instructions were issued to Herriot, instructing him to strictly maintain neutrality in Washington, to maintain the position of a bystander on the one hand, and to make every effort to promote the convening of the World Economic Conference on the other hand, and to strive to restore the gold standard in various countries and stabilize finance. If war debts are mentioned, Herriot has the right to participate in jointly drafting any plan to solve the general war debt problem. At the same time, according to information obtained by France from Washington, British Prime Minister MacDonald has agreed to discuss stabilizing currency prices as soon as possible and agreed with the US view that war debt revision is only a point of view in the entire economic problem. France's decision to maintain the gold standard has restored the stability of France's financial sector. People in the financial sector firmly believe that if the US currency inflation does not exceed the scope of restrictions, the domestic market in France will not panic. However, it is believed that the authorities have already formulated protection procedures, which can be implemented if the US currency falls sharply.</p>
<p>Reuters New York 22nd Dispatch. The New York Times predicts that there will be at least one crack in the tone of the Washington Conference. It is said that the British delegation is quite unhappy that Herriot immediately came to the United States while the British representatives were still in Washington. The British delegation hoped that the United Kingdom and the United States had reached an understanding before the French representatives arrived in the United States, so that they could use this agreement to make France join the solid commercial and monetary alliance that the United Kingdom and the United States had already agreed upon. The newspaper also said that Herriot's arrival in the United States may cause some animosity among Americans, because the French finance minister stated today that France will never abandon the gold standard.</p>
<h3>Japan Reconsiders</h3>
<p>Japanese United Press Tokyo 23rd Dispatch. US President Roosevelt convened the Washington Preparatory Meeting to save the depression of the world economy. However, before the British and French representatives were on board the ship to the United States, the United States suddenly implemented a ban on gold exports. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs recognizes the US move as a determination to start its economic power and dominate international diplomacy, and is seriously alert. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs believed that the purpose of the US request to send representatives was to open up the world's economic difficulties, so it gladly accepted its proposal. However, after observing the attitude of the United States, the true intention of convening the meeting has quite a few points that make people unable to be optimistic. Therefore, the Japanese government's established policy has had to change its fundamentals. The Japanese government will still advocate that Japan is responsible for promoting peace in the Far East on political issues at the Washington Conference, while advocating the following policies on economic issues: (1) Unconditional return to the gold standard, (2) Raising and stabilizing silver prices, (3) Uniform reduction of tariffs, (4) Implementation of free trade.</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>America Abandons the Gold Standard (Continued) Obscure</h3>
<p>The Impact on the Global Economy</p>
<p>Prior to the United States abandoning the gold standard, only a few countries in the world still maintained it, namely France, Germany, Switzerland, and a few others. Among these, only France and Germany possessed some influence in guiding financial capital. However, Germany, since the end of World War I, had suffered from the heavy burden of reparations and the pressure of high tariff barriers. The general consumer spending within the country gradually declined, leading to industrial decline and trade stagnation, making it difficult to recover. As a result, unemployment increased, and national power weakened. Although Hitler tried his utmost to struggle and vigorously advocated a self-sufficient revival movement, it is not difficult to imagine how much practical benefit it could achieve. Based on common sense, the maximum effect would be no more than injecting a heart stimulant into a critically ill patient. Currently, only France can barely sustain itself. It possesses gold reserves of over 3.2 billion US dollars, and its industry still has room for development, unlike the highly developed industries of Germany and the United States, which cannot survive without the expansion of overseas markets. However, former French Prime Minister Édouard Herriot, en route to the United States, suddenly heard the US President's order to abandon the gold standard and lamented that his entire plan for the Washington talks was thus overturned. Britain also stated that its plans would undergo significant changes because trade competition would become increasingly fierce. Britain abandoned the gold standard in the autumn of the previous year. At that time, the United States, Japan, and other countries still maintained the par value of gold, so it was able to gain market share for British products in silver-using countries in the Far East and other parts of the world. When Japan also abolished the gold standard and adopted a policy of inflation, the benefits of British foreign trade were threatened to some extent. Now that the United States has also abandoned the gold standard, the benefits that Britain previously gained will be difficult to maintain and will be fundamentally shaken. As a result, the temporary understanding between Britain and the United States in the Washington fireside chats before the World Economic Conference will be even more difficult to achieve. The deadlock in the Franco-American war debt relationship may be even more difficult to break, adding another thorny obstacle to the future of the World Economic Conference.</p>
<p>As for the relationship between the United States and Japan, it may worsen as a result. The competition for the Far East trade market, especially the struggle for the China trade market, will intensify the confrontation between Japan and the United States. Furthermore, with the United States suspending the gold standard (devaluing the US dollar), competition between Japan and the United States in the market will become increasingly fierce. However, we must know that the foundation of the Japanese industrial sector lies in the textile industry, and its dumping in our country's market is mainly textiles, especially cotton products. The United States is a heavy industry nation, and Japan is its market for exporting raw cotton and steel. Therefore, the conflict of economic interests may not be particularly exacerbated by the United States implementing an inflationary policy. However, Japan's annexation of the four northeastern provinces and its current oppression of North China, in its desire to monopolize our country's market, will not only strengthen the Chinese people's active resistance movement but will also arouse extreme resentment from the United States and Britain. Even if it does not lead to a bloody war, economic struggles will inevitably become more intense.</p>
<p>Moreover, in the current era, economic blocs are at their peak. The group led by Britain has already formed, first aiming for self-sufficiency within the British Empire's autonomous territories and colonies, and then using their collective power to develop overseas markets and dominate East Asia. Japan, rampant in the Far East and sweeping across our four northeastern provinces, daily promotes its so-called "Japan-Manchuria Economic Bloc" theory, intending to compete with Britain and the United States. The United States leads North and South America to follow, intending to develop overseas with all its strength and will not back down. The Soviet Union possesses another kind of strength, standing between the various blocs of capitalist alliances. These are all clear facts of each expanding its economic power. However, today's world economic situation is different from the gold standard panic of 1931 (when more countries still maintained the gold standard, and tariff barriers were not as high as they are today). Therefore, the relative position of the US dollar may not be lower than that of the British pound or the Japanese yen. The relative balance between the US dollar and the British pound will still be maintained. Whether viewed from the amount of (cash) held by the United States, from the excess of receipts over international payments, from the position of the United States in the world economy, or from the production costs of its industrial products, the economic power behind the US dollar is at a considerable level. Therefore, it is difficult to resolve the question of how much benefit the United States can ultimately reap after suspending the gold standard. A concrete answer can be expected from future facts. However, current economic competition among Britain, the United States, France, and Japan is becoming more acute due to the United States abandoning the gold standard. This will further promote future bloody wars. Our country has been invaded for a long time and is now the sole target of all eyes. Looking around, how will we handle ourselves?</p>
<h3>The Situation in Xinjiang is Becoming Increasingly Serious</h3>
<p>The Three Sides are Entirely Under Muslim Control</p>
<p>Internal and External Communications are Cut Off</p>
<p>Shi Qingyang Says the Central Government is Selecting High-Ranking Officials to Go</p>
<p>(Nanjing) News from transportation circles: The situation in Xinjiang is severely changing. Mail to the province, which used to go through the Shaanxi-Gansu route to Xinjiang, is now rerouted due to unrest in various places. All mail to Xinjiang is now transported by water to Vladivostok, then by the Siberian Railway to Verkhneudinsk, Semipalatinsk, Krasnoyarsk, and then to Dihua. Recently, Dihua has been besieged by Muslims, and internal and external communications have been cut off. The Eurasia Aviation Corporation's route, which passes through Dihua, is now suspended because airplanes cannot land due to the incident. Therefore, the Shanghai-Berlin air route has been indefinitely delayed. There were originally missionaries and foreigners living in Xinjiang. It is now reported that foreign missionaries of the Central Asian Missionary Society have fled Xinjiang to the Indian border. In addition, seven British citizens have left Kashgar for Yarkand, indicating a tense situation. Muslim groups in Beiping have telegraphed to Nanjing, saying that Xinjiang Chairman Jin Shuren hates Islam, which has led to the incident. The Post Office has notified Eurasia Aviation Corporation to stop sending airmail to Dihua, all of which are evidence of the serious situation. (Special dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The central government telegraphed the Xinjiang provincial government regarding the Xinjiang incident, inquiring about the true situation in detail. Jin Shuren telegraphed back, reporting the unclear details of the incident and requesting that the government send personnel of high reputation who are familiar with the border situation to investigate so that he can submit it and resolve it appropriately. Relevant agencies such as the Executive Yuan Military Affairs Committee and the General Staff Headquarters have discussed this issue and agreed that sending personnel to Xinjiang to investigate the true situation of the incident is feasible, but the selection of personnel still needs to be considered. Zhang Fengjiu, Xinjiang's representative in Nanjing, also intends to travel with the central government's selected personnel after the decision is made. (Special dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Shi Qingyang, Chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, said that the situation in Xinjiang is very serious. He recently received a telegram stating that the entire southeast and west sides of Xinjiang Province are now entirely under Muslim control, and the provincial army has retreated to the north, also forming a besieged situation. According to a telegram from Division Commander Ma Shaowu, the Muslims in the area where his division is stationed have not taken any drastic action, but Division Commander Ma is also a Muslim, and the area where he is stationed should be relatively peaceful. Chairman Jin Shuren telegraphed that the Muslim rebellion was spreading, but did not mention the extent to which it had spread, and said that it would not be difficult to quell. There are discrepancies between the various sources of information, but the seriousness should be a fact. There are two reasons for the sudden rise of the Muslims: (1) The provincial army recruited more than 3,000 White Russians and formed an army. Military discipline was corrupt, causing harassment everywhere, which aroused great resentment among the Muslims. This is the immediate cause. (2) The provincial authorities imprisoned the eight Muslim princes, and the Muslims missed their leaders, constantly plotting to oppose the current government. This is the long-term cause. The central government has now sent high-ranking officials to Xinjiang, one to investigate the truth of the rebellion and the other to convey the central government's intentions and give appropriate treatment. Our country's ambassador to the Soviet Union, Yan Huiqing, also recently telegraphed the central government, so the central government attaches great importance to this matter. However, the selection of high-ranking officials to be sent is still being discussed by Wang Jingwei and Chiang Kai-shek and has not yet been decided, because the person to be sent (1) must have a considerable relationship with Jin Shuren so as not to be rejected by him, and (2) must be believed by the Muslims in order to accept the central government's treatment. Regarding the situation in the Northwest, the situation is also very serious, because the Japanese army will inevitably attack Chahar from Rehe in order to create its ideal Mongolian state, and recent reports indicate that what Japan covets is not limited to Chahar Province, but also includes Suiyuan in its plans for occupation. The Mongolian Committee recently specially dispatched Chen Wun to Chahar and Dolonor to carry out propaganda, and also sent Ba Wanjun to accompany him. Recent telegrams report that the Mongols in the northwest welcomed them from afar, blocking the road, and expressed their determination not to be used by Japan. From this, it can be seen that Japan's ideal Mongolian state will not easily become a reality. The Beiping Office of the Mongolian Committee has recently moved to Zhangjiakou to facilitate work in the Northwest. However, at this time, Japan is using force to invade us in the Northwest, and our method of resistance should also be based on force. The Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission can only do its best in political propaganda. Regarding the Sichuan issue, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has summoned the representatives of the Sichuan army stationed in Nanjing, such as Fu Zhenwu, the representative of Liu Xiang, Xie Tianmin, the representative of Deng Xihou, and Wang Yinchun, the representative of Liu Cunhou, to Nanchang to discuss Sichuan affairs. It is not yet known what issues are being discussed. As for the statement that the Sichuan army will be transferred to Hubei and Shaanxi, and the Shaanxi and Hubei troops will go to resist Japan, I do not know the content of this matter. However, last year, I submitted a report to the central government, advocating that 200,000 Sichuan troops be transferred to suppress the Red Bandits in Hubei and Jiangxi, and that the opening expenses of several million yuan for each army should be raised at one time. The Sichuan members of the central government should return to Sichuan to organize a financial committee to repay this amount in five years and supervise the local financial revenue as compensation.

<h3>Ma Zhanshan Discusses the Battle of Nenjiang</h3>
<p>(Berlin) General Ma Zhanshan, known for his resistance to Japan, recently arrived here with several senior officers. He spoke in detail to a reporter from the Evening News about his achievements in the Battle of Nenjiang, saying: "With 1,300 men, I fought against 20,000 Japanese for three days and three nights. In the end, only 100 of my men remained. We retreated under cover of night and were able to escape unharmed." When the reporter asked if he would go to the front again after returning to China, the general replied that as long as the Chinese people are not free from Japanese oppression, his determination to fight Japan will not cease for a day. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Berlin local newspapers prominently published news of Berlin's overseas Chinese welcoming General Ma Zhanshan, a hero of the Battle of Nenjiang, and other officers. The meeting was attended by 1,200 people, and all the staff of the Chinese Embassy were present. General Ma gave a lengthy speech to the crowd, recounting his experiences in resisting the Japanese army. The audience was moved.

<p>(Moscow) Reports from Khabarovsk say that Japanese border troops have been very rude in obstructing Soviet vehicles at Suifenhe Station, the eastern end of the Chinese Eastern Railway. The report mentions two recent incidents. One was on April 14, when Japanese border troops detained a train that was about to leave Suifenhe for Grottekovo Station on the Ussuri Railway, with four empty freight cars and eighteen empty water tanks that had already unloaded their goods and were urgently needed to be returned to the Ussuri Railway. The Japanese military police forcibly unloaded them and tried to seize two locomotives belonging to the Ussuri Railway. Another incident occurred on April 15, when a locomotive belonging to the Ussuri Railway was leaving Suifenhe Station for Grottekovo Station and was shot at by Japanese troops. It is reported that the Suifenhe Station Master has submitted a written protest to the Japanese Border Commander Kamura, pointing out that this kind of behavior violates the existing agreement between the Chinese Eastern Railway and the Ussuri Railway. (TASS, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Changchun) The (Manchukuo) Ministry of Communications issued a reply yesterday refuting the protest by Director Kuznetsov of the Eastern Railway regarding the blockade of the Eastern Railway. The main points are as follows: (1) The Commander of the Border Police did not issue an order that "goods may not be transferred without government instructions." (2) The national government is blocking the connection points between the Eastern Railway and the Outer Baikal Railway within legal and unobstructed limits. (3) The reason for using this means is that the two railways not only have no agreement to connect and link, but one side has unilaterally transported thousands of freight cars into Soviet Russia and has not returned the locomotives. Therefore, it is specially declared that your protest is unreasonable. (Telecommunications, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Changchun) In addition to issuing a rebuttal to the content of the Soviet Union's reply, Ding Jianxiu, the (Manchukuo) Minister of Communications, also stated the following: This dispute is due to illegal acts during the imperial era, which the current regime continues to exercise. Therefore, the Ministry only needs to prevent this illegal act. As for the outside rumors of buying the Eastern Railway,</p>
<h3>Wang Jingguo Commands All Troops Stationed in Suiyuan</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Wang Jingguo, a member of the cabinet, serves as the Garrison Commander of Suiyuan Province, commanding all troops stationed in the province to maintain local order. (Special dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<h3>Mutiny of [P Fake Country's Troops&gt;</h3>
<p>(Harbin) The (Manchukuo) troops stationed in Taipingling mutinied today, taking three Russian railway staff members hostage and fleeing into the nearby mountains. Some bandits demolished the tracks near Weisha River, intercepted freight cars, and kidnapped the people in the cars. News from the Japanese in Suifenhe claims that only a few freight cars have arrived there from the Ussuri Railway. The Japanese side views this as evidence that the Soviet authorities do not want to return the vehicles they have detained. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Japanese Side Declares That No Accidents Will Occur in Beiping and Tianjin</h3>
<p>Japanese Consul in Tianjin Warns Residents Not to Panic</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Because British and American residents are obstructing the occupation of Beiping and Tianjin, which is becoming more powerful, Japan declares that its military operations in the Great Wall area have ended and that no accidents will occur in Beiping and Tianjin. The Japanese Consul in Tianjin also issued a notice to the residents' association, urging them to live peacefully and not to panic. (Special dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) In recent days, the situation in North China has become tense. Envoys stationed in Beiping have exchanged opinions, advocating preventing the expansion of the war. A reporter visited a foreign affairs official and was told that foreign envoys may have this kind of advocacy due to the interests of their respective countries in North China, but our party and country still adhere to a consistent policy of resisting to the end and will never negotiate a compromise. Like the Treaty of Versailles signed by Germany after the European War, it is still bound by France and cannot be free. Now, the great powers are paying close attention to the safety of Beiping and Tianjin. If Japan makes any reckless moves, the countries will make serious expressions.

<h3>Russian Goods Sell Well in Beiping</h3>

<h3>Imports of Foreign Cotton Increase Daily</h3>
<p>Our Cotton Production Decreases Year by Year</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Industry believes that my country's cotton production is very abundant, but it has gradually decreased due to the impact of disasters and banditry, and imports of foreign cotton have increased. In order to remedy this in the future, it has specially investigated the situation as follows: My country's cotton production was most abundant in the eighth year of the Republic, with a total of 9,018,390 dan nationwide. After that, it decreased year by year until the second year of the Republic, etc., which is all unfounded. (Telecommunications, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Li Shaogeng, the Director-General of the Chinese Eastern Railway, received a letter from Deputy Director-General Koshnikov on April 10, questioning the suspension of the transportation of Russian goods from Siberia and the Ussuri Railway through Manzhouli and Suifenhe. He replied on April 22, stating that the Chinese Eastern Railway has no special agreement and should be subject to the transportation of these goods. (Manchukuo) had to suspend transportation for the following reasons: (1) The Soviet Union forcibly drove freight cars into Russian territory. (2) The Soviet Union prepared to drive locomotives in Manzhouli into Russian territory. (3) The Soviet Union disregarded (Manchukuo)'s repeated protests against the continuous removal of freight cars. (4) The removed trains have not yet been returned. Li also stated that the 1924 Shenyang Agreement stipulates that the original treaty of 1897 must be revised, and now the Soviet Union must bear the responsibility for not fulfilling this clause. Since the temporary agreement cannot meet today's needs, it is necessary to immediately revise the old treaty and re-sign it. If it is not revised, then (Manchukuo) will not be responsible for the consequences. Li concluded by saying that the important positions on the Chinese Eastern Railway are now occupied by Soviet personnel, so they can do whatever they want. The railway administration is now controlled by the Soviet side, so it is absolutely necessary to revise the current agreement so that both sides can jointly manage the railway administration in harmony. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Changchun) The pseudo-organization yesterday responded to the Russian protest with even more intense wording, refuting it point by point, and demanding that all detained vehicles be returned by May 12, otherwise, it would take the necessary second step. The Japanese are attacking Russia step by step, probably because the completion of the Jihui Railway has brought many military conveniences. The clouds between Japan and Russia are gradually becoming urgent. (China United Press, 23rd)</p>
<p>Only six, three, nine, nine, seven, eight, zero dan. Before the eighth year of the Republic, cotton exports always exceeded imports. From the ninth year of the Republic, imports exceeded exports by 302,067 dan. By the twentieth year of the Republic, imports exceeded exports by 3,456,494 dan, worth 132,265,669 customs taels. In the past twelve years, imports have increased by more than eleven times. (Special dispatch on the 23rd)</p>

<h3>Requesting Funds for Troop Deployment is Not a Fact</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Southwest's dispatch of troops to suppress the bandits in Jiangxi has been rumored for a long time but has not been realized. Chen Jitang's staff in Nanjing said that Chen recently telegraphed Yang Dezhao, deciding to send troops to southern Jiangxi to suppress the bandits. In addition to the First Army's Yu Hanmou's troops to the Dayuling area, five more regiments will be dispatched and also placed under the command of Yu Hanmou to enter Jiangxi. They are currently waiting for the dispatched troops of the 19th Route Army to arrive in Laolong before they can jointly set off. If necessary, more troops will be dispatched. Regarding the shortage of ammunition in Guangdong Province, it should be obtained from the Ministry of Military Affairs. Yang Dezhao came to Nanjing from Shanghai the day before yesterday to obtain ammunition from the Ministry of Military Affairs, but Chen did not mention the troop deployment funds in his telegram. When Yang visited Chiang in Jiangxi, it was also not discussed. The statement that Chen requested several million yuan from the central government for troop deployment funds is not a fact. After Yang Dezhao returned to Shanghai from Nanjing a few days ago, it was recently heard that he went to Hangzhou to recuperate and will not go to Guangdong for the time being.

<h3>Huang Musong Returns to Nanjing from Beiping</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Advisor Huang Musong returned to Nanjing from Beiping this morning. He said that he is a member of the Central China Affairs Office. Last month, he went to Xinxiang and Baoding. Later, he received a telegram from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, instructing him to go to Beiping to assist Minister He in handling important official matters. Mr. He has profound military knowledge and plans military affairs in an orderly manner. He is extremely busy handling important official matters every day. The day before yesterday, he received a telegram from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, instructing him to return south, so he immediately took a car south. During his month in Beiping, he visited Gubeikou, Xifengkou, and other places and saw that the morale was high and the spirit was vigorous. Their spirit of sacrifice is commendable. The weather in North China is still cold, and the soldiers are fighting in the arena. We should do our best to carry out comfort and rescue work to treat the men who have been injured for the country. Recently, the fighting has been fierce in Gubeikou, and the situation in Luandong has recently become silent. There is no fighting in Dolonor and other places in eastern Chahar, which is being strictly defended and can be guaranteed to be safe. The Japanese army has heard about the so-called organization of puppet governments in various places in Luandong, which is extremely painful. This seems to be a predetermined plan of the Japanese. As for Beiping and Tianjin, the recent defenses have become more consolidated. In recent days, the Chinese people seem to pay attention to the safety of Beiping and Tianjin, which is not surprising. Victory or defeat in war is commonplace. As long as the spirit of resistance does not weaken, the final victory can be achieved. (Special dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<h3>Bai Yunti Discusses the Situation in Ximeng</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Bai Yunti said that after the loss of Rehe, Prince De and Zhangjia repeatedly telegraphed the central government to ask for instructions on how to handle the situation. The central government sent Ke Xinge to Chahar to discuss everything with Prince De. Prince De has Mongolian troops that can be used by the central government. There are rumors that Japan will instigate Tibet to organize a New Continent country. This is Japanese propaganda, attempting to link Qinghai, Ximeng, Xinjiang, and Rehe together as a base for its invasion of Asia. But our China is a five-nation republic and should resolutely resist. I received a telegram from Zhang Ji urging me to go north and will leave within days. (Special dispatch on the 23rd)</p>

<h3>The Saito Cabinet is About to be Reorganized</h3>
<p>The Seiyukai Party is Pressuring Saito to Resign En Masse</p>
<p>The Minseito Party Consistently Supports the Current Cabinet</p>
<p>Saito Tends to Dissolve the Diet</p>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Domei News Agency) – Due to Prime Minister Saito's declaration to resolutely reorganize the cabinet and not resign en masse, the political situation has suddenly become tense. Judging from the current political situation, it is difficult to retain Finance Minister Takahashi. After the Finance Minister resigns, some advocate appointing Wakatsuki, the president of the Minseito Party, to succeed him. Others say that Interior Minister Yamamoto will be transferred to become Finance Minister, and Wakatsuki will succeed him as Interior Minister. In short, Prime Minister Saito will inevitably dissolve the Diet, allowing the Minseito Party to take the opportunity to regain the seats taken by the Seiyukai Party. There is no doubt about it. Since Prime Minister Saito is determined to reorganize the cabinet and advance the current situation, the various political factions have to change their lineups. The observations of each party on this matter are recorded below:</p>
<h3>The Threat of the Seiyukai Party</h3>
<p>Although Prime Minister Saito has declared that he will not resign en masse, it is difficult to determine what the Prime Minister intends. Those responsible for assisting the government cannot state the date of resignation in advance. We firmly believe that after Finance Minister Takahashi resigns, the cabinet will resign en masse. If it extends its life by reorganization, the Seiyukai cabinet members will resign together. In the end, the reorganization will fail, and it will inevitably lead to a resignation en masse. The next cabinet must belong to our party because our party has an absolute majority of 300 members, which cannot be ignored in fact.</p>
<h3>The Protection and Support of the Minseito Party</h3>
<p>When Secretary-General Matsuda met with Interior Minister Yamamoto on the 21st, the Interior Minister said that (although Finance Minister Takahashi resigned, there are enough people to supplement him), which is consistent with the Prime Minister's words. It can also be seen that the Prime Minister's determination is firm. Our party has always supported the current cabinet, and even the elder statesmen and senior officials hope for the continuation of the current cabinet. No matter how the Seiyukai Party plots, it will not lead to a resignation en masse. If Finance Minister Takahashi resigns, it is planned to advise the party's cabinet members to reorganize the cabinet, dissolve the Diet, and advance the current situation.</p>
<h3>Observations of the House of Peers</h3>
<p>The domestic and foreign situation is becoming more and more critical. The mission of the Saito cabinet has not yet been completed. Therefore, although Finance Minister Takahashi resigned due to illness, it cannot be a reason for a resignation en masse. It can be supplemented. However, it is doubtful whether the Seiyukai Party will agree to the reorganization of the cabinet. Although the Prime Minister intends to reorganize, the result may be failure and resignation en masse. The successor cabinet must wait until the resignation en masse to see how the Seiyukai Party handles it and the impact of the May 15th Incident. It may be a Seiyukai Party cabinet, or the Great Mandate may be bestowed upon Prime Minister Saito again, or it may be bestowed upon another planet. It must be decided at that time.</p>
<h3>Saito's Side Expresses</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Domei News Agency) – Prime Minister Saito once declared that even if Finance Minister Takahashi resigns, he should reorganize the cabinet to take charge of the current situation. However, Minister of Education Hatoyama has long expressed opposition to the Prime Minister's reorganization proposal and threatened the withdrawal of the Seiyukai-affiliated cabinet members and to sever ties with the Saito cabinet. If so, the Saito cabinet will reverse the spirit of forming a united national cabinet. The Prime Minister's aides have made the following remarks on this point: If the Seiyukai-affiliated cabinet members withdraw from the cabinet, it may be said that the national significance is lost. However, this is a minor issue, and whether it can take charge of the extraordinary situation is the fundamental issue. If the successor cabinet is a strong and powerful cabinet, then it is another matter. If the Suzuki cabinet, the Ugaki cabinet, and the Hiruma cabinet cannot be realized, then even if the Saito cabinet severs ties with the Seiyukai Party, if it is handled well with great determination, then there is still meaning in its continuation.</p>
<h3>Cancellation of the India-Japan Commercial Treaty Will Reduce the Japanese Textile Industry's Output</h3>
<p>The US Ban on Gold Exports Also Hits Japanese Cotton Cloth Exports</p>
<p>The Increase in Spindles Plan is Frustrated, and Japan Has a Monthly Surplus of 40,000 Bundles of Yarn</p>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Domei News Agency) – The plan to increase the number of spindles in textile companies has been very popular since last year. As of April 1st, the actual number of spindles has increased by 156,840 compared to the end of last year, and the planned increase in the number of spindles this year is about 600,000. Due to the sudden cancellation of the India-Japan Commercial Treaty, concerns about the high tariff rates that followed, and the high exchange rate since the United States banned gold exports, leading to concerns about sluggish cotton cloth exports, the plan to increase the number of spindles has been frustrated. The cloth shipped to India last year totaled 644,000 yards, which is equivalent to 410,000 bundles of cotton yarn. In addition, 40,000 bundles were consumed in cotton fabrics and other products, totaling 450,000 bundles. This is the amount of production shipped to India. Compared with the cotton yarn production of 2.8 million bundles in the last fiscal year, it accounts for 17%. If India imposes high tariffs and stops exports, there will be a surplus of about 40,000 bundles of yarn per month. Even if it is calculated at half of that, 20,000 bundles, it is necessary to adjust the production volume of that amount. In addition, exports to countries other than India are unlikely to improve due to the high exchange rate. Therefore, the reduction rate of work after July will inevitably expand to some extent.</p>
<h3>The Impact of the British-Russian Boycott</h3>
<p>Moscow, 22nd (Reuters) – Soviet Russian Foreign Commissar Litvinov made a statement to Reuters today, stating in essence that the British ban on the import of Russian goods would ultimately result in losses. Soviet Russia's trade policy is extremely flexible with regard to imported goods. When expanded, it can make foreign trade extremely inflated, and when shrunk, foreign goods disappear, without harming Soviet Russia's construction. If other countries try to force Soviet Russia to reduce imports, they will only hurt themselves. The reduction in foreign goods entering Russia will further exacerbate the general economic panic in the world. In the near future, Soviet Russia can reduce the world's reserves of a certain metal by 30% to 10%.</p>
<p>Moscow, 22nd (Reuters) – After Britain banned the import of Russian goods, Soviet Russia implemented a retaliatory policy and also banned the import of British goods. According to informed sources, Soviet Russia's move has two trends: one is a diplomatic effect, using this to cover up the pardon of the two Englishmen who are currently detained, and the other is a prelude to the severance of diplomatic relations between Britain and Russia, and to show other countries Soviet Russia's strong posture. Although the current tension between the two countries is not immediately eased, it is difficult to predict the future of the situation. However, judging from the current situation, diplomatic relations will not break down immediately. It is found that Russia's trade with Britain is in a surplus position, reaching more than 25 million pounds. This is the most valuable asset for Soviet Russia to pay off foreign debts. It is almost impossible to seek this kind of surplus from other countries at present. This is the biggest reason why Soviet Russia does not want to break off relations with Britain immediately.</p>
<p>London, 23rd (Reuters) – The Vickers Company's technicians in Russia, Monkhouse and four others, arrived at Liverpool Street Station at 9:00 AM this morning. There was a large crowd welcoming them on the platform. After Meng and others got off the train, there was a loud cheer, and then everyone stood at attention and sang the national anthem. Vickers Company's general manager, Paul, shook hands with the returning staff one by one. Meng and others felt happy to return home safely and reunite with their families. However, the thought of their colleagues Thornton and MacDonald being imprisoned made them feel sad. Meng and others will not comment on the Russian trial before meeting in London to discuss the matter.</p>
<p>London, 22nd (Reuters) – Reuters learned from official circles that special import licenses may be granted if there are real difficulties encountered due to the ban on the import of Russian goods. However, licenses will not be granted on the grounds that Russian goods are cheaper than goods from other countries. Special events that may be considered by the authorities include Russian goods ordered before the ban that could not be delivered in time and those that would cause unemployment difficulties. Minister of Commerce, Hinkman, is scheduled to return to London on Monday to study this matter.</p>
<p>London, 23rd (Reuters) – The leader of the Soviet Russian trade delegation, Vorsecky, and two members of the delegation left England by train from Victoria Station this morning and headed to Moscow. The Russian Ambassador to England went to the station to see them off. It is found that the Anglo-Russian Commercial Treaty expires on April 17th. Britain banned the import of Russian goods, and the Soviet Russian Foreign Trade Committee summoned the commercial delegation stationed in England to return home for consultation. Therefore, the Russian delegation is now starting its journey home, and all its duties in England are temporarily suspended.</p>
<h3>The US Senate Delays the Inflationary Currency Bill</h3>
<p>Rural Relief Association Vetoed</p>
<p>Washington, 22nd (Guomin News Agency) – Today, the US Senate's consideration of the government's inflationary currency bill is nothing more than delaying tactics with mutual recriminations among senators. It seems unlikely that it will be passed quickly. According to Senate Majority Leader Robinson, it may not be passed in the Senate until next Wednesday. In the House, former Treasury Secretary Mellon and Mills were the targets of attacks by congressmen. Congressman Rankin angrily denounced the two for entering and leaving the congressional rest rooms, calling them enemies of the public and saying that the two men's policies were largely responsible for the economic decline. However, although the two were very active, even the Republican leader admitted that it was hopeless to stop the currency inflation. It is expected that the Senate will pass the bill by a two-to-one margin. It is currently being investigated that most senators seem to favor granting the President the power to decide whether to mint silver coins. If the President orders the minting of silver coins, then the ratio of gold to silver will also be stipulated.</p>
<p>Washington, 22nd (Reuters) – The Senate today voted 44 to 25 against a recommendation to allocate more funding for rural mortgages. The bill to reallocate 200 million yuan for rural mortgages was formally endorsed by the Senate as part of a rural relief bill and was passed by the House earlier this month.</p>
<h3>Canada Maintains the Gold Standard</h3>
<p>Ottawa, 22nd (Reuters) – Due to outside rumors that Canada has effectively abandoned the gold standard, the Ministry of Finance specifically announced today that Canada will continue to maintain the gold standard in the same way as after September 1931, i.e., cash can only be transported for export with a license issued by the Ministry of Finance. It is currently believed that the news spreading from the United States originated from Canada's recent implementation of amendments to the Canadian Gold Bond Law. The amendments give the Governor-General the power to temporarily suspend the payment of Canadian gold bonds.</p>
<p>Winnipeg, 22nd (Reuters) – Due to rumors that Canada will tighten restrictions on gold exports, the local wheat price soared by 3 and 3/8 to 3 and 7/8 cents per bushel. Speculators snapped it up. Chicago futures wheat prices initially fell by about one cent and closed up by about two cents.</p>
<h3>Disarmament Conference Reopens</h3>
<p>London, 22nd (Havas) – The Disarmament Conference is scheduled to reopen next Monday. Chairman Henderson originally planned to go to Geneva tomorrow to participate in disarmament work, but suddenly changed his itinerary to set off today. Before departing, Henderson issued a statement to the press, saying that he hopes that the work of the Disarmament Conference will make sufficient progress in the next three months so that a disarmament convention can be signed when the next League of Nations General Assembly is held.</p>
<h3>Generals Confer in Beiping to Discuss Defense Strategies</h3>
<p>Shang Zhen and Song Zheyuan Have Both Arrived in Beiping</p>
<p>Detailed Discussions Have Repeatedly Produced Solutions</p>
<p>Special Dispatch from Beiping: Since the fall of Chengde, our army has been fighting against the enemy at various passes of the Great Wall and east of Luanzhou for more than a month. Although they were forced to retreat into the pass and abandon Luandong due to the enemy's pressure, several bloody battles greatly frustrated the enemy's advance, and the national spirit was fully demonstrated to the world. However, this operation also had several causes of failure: (1) The Japanese army's weapons are far superior to ours. The positions built by our army are often bombarded by enemy aircraft and artillery, destroying everything. Soldiers lose cover and cannot fight back. In addition, the dispatch of troops is often threatened by Japanese aircraft, making it difficult to move and delaying support, missing opportunities. In the future, it is necessary to find ways to improve air defense, trench construction, and transportation. (2) The quality of the combat troops is uneven, the strength is unequal, and they fight separately without much communication. The pace of advance and retreat is uneven, and victory and defeat are not mutually supportive, resulting in piecemeal attacks and missed opportunities. In the future, it is also necessary to find ways to improve the unity of command and the allocation of forces. (3) This operation took a purely defensive stance, placing heavy troops on a very long front of hundreds of miles, using them inflexibly, fighting wherever the enemy came, only being attacked and not attacking. The Japanese army saw through this point and, after gaining momentum, placed a small number of defense troops, with deep trenches and high walls, temporarily taking a defensive stance, and then concentrated the main force in one place, making a full-force breakthrough, coming and going unpredictably, with unstable defense. Therefore, the enemy's forces often gathered, while ours were often scattered. Although there were heavy troops, they also felt weak. A breakthrough in one direction led to a collapse of the entire line. In the future, it is necessary to research the strategy of offense and defense. (4) The cost of provisions, ammunition, and pay is extremely important to the operation. The front line is engaged in bloody hand-to-hand combat, but the rear is unable to provide assistance. Even if there are good generals, it is difficult to make a good end. Before Zhang Xueliang stepped down, the allocation of anti-Japanese war funds was uneven. After Zhang left, there was no way to cope. The frontline soldiers felt that their demands were not met, and the authorities felt overwhelmed and extremely distressed. In the future, it is necessary to plan ahead for the raising of war funds and the supply of pay and weapons. In general, the above four points are closely related to the failure of this war. Since the withdrawal from Luandong, the generals have come to Beiping to discuss the defense strategy. Yesterday morning (19th), the military branch held a meeting, and He Yingqin, Wan Fulin, Wang Shuchang, Jiang Bocheng, Shang Zhen, Pang Bingxun, and others attended. Yu Xuezhong also rushed from Tianjin to participate. At the meeting, there was a long discussion on the defense plan, and a decision was generally made. Last night, the generals met again at the private residence of a certain important person in the West City to exchange opinions. They dispersed late at night. The generals will all pledge to fight to the death with the Japanese invaders, and they will not care about success or failure. Some also advocate improving the past failures, making careful arrangements, and fighting the enemy to the death. If this is not possible, then another way to deal with it should be sought. Today (20th), Song Zheyuan was summoned to Beiping. He first met with He Yingqin, and then met with Shang, Pang, and others to continue detailed discussions. Concrete measures should be taken within a day or two. Since our army withdrew to Luanxi on the 17th, except for Japanese aircraft reconnaissance bombing in the Luanzhou and Tangshan areas every day, there have been no battles on the front line. Yesterday morning, there was a slight contact at Zhugezhuang, 20 miles east of Luanzhou, but it stopped soon after. This morning, the weather was overcast and rainy, and the front line was quiet. Japanese aircraft did not take off either. The Japanese and puppet troops are currently searching in Luandong, planning to establish a puppet organization in the five counties of Luandong, led by Li Jichun and others. Before the arrangements are in place, there is no intention to advance west for the time being. There was also no movement in the Gubeikou area this morning. In the Xifengkou area, the Japanese army has repeatedly tried to cross the river to attack Beinan and Beituan Ting, but all failed. In recent days, the Japanese 16th Division's Uraki Detachment has been concentrating in that direction, planning to launch another large-scale attack. The situation there is extremely tense.

<h3>Illusions of Inspecting the Xifengkou Area</h3>
<p>(Special Correspondent Geng Ya from this Newspaper)</p>
<p>Visiting Various Positions at Sahé Bridge, Santunying, and Luowenyu</p>
<p>Special dispatch from Santunying: Xifengkou is a vital strategic pass for the defense of the Great Wall.  However, the commanding generals of Rehe had no determination to resist.  As soon as they made contact with the enemy, they retreated one after another, allowing the enemy to seize our highlands outside the pass.  They could then use heavy artillery fire to suppress our troops defending the pass.  Later, with the fall of Lengkou, the enemy further threatened with heavy troops, causing that pass to become an exposed position.  Although the brave and battle-hardened 29th Army was stationed there, they were forced to abandon it due to strategic considerations. This bad news reached the reporter when I set out from Ping (Beijing).  I encountered Army Commander Wang Yizhe in Sanhe, who confirmed it to me. The military had not yet announced it at the time. Hearing this news was like a bucket of cold water poured over my head.  The inspection of Xifengkou, the sole main purpose of this trip, had become an illusion. Upon arriving in Zunhua, I received a warm welcome from Division Commander Zhang of the 38th Division, who dispatched personnel to guide me to the important positions at Sahé Bridge, Santunying, and Luowenyu.  I reported the situation of our troops in combat and the main conversations with various generals in a previous letter.  Now, I will briefly record the extraordinary spirit of the 29th Army and the hardships of the war zone, directly and indirectly related to the war, based on my observations.</p>
<p>The outstanding spirit of the 29th Army is primarily characterized by strict precautions. Whenever the army arrives at a place, regardless of the duration of their stay, they diligently and quickly construct fortifications, such as repairing city walls, digging trenches, excavating caves, embedding artillery positions, and deploying sentries. When the army was first transferred to the Sanhe-Jixian area, the war was still brewing, but the army's defensive works were already complete. Later, they suddenly took over the defense from Wan Jun (name of a unit or general). While fighting bravely, they continued to work on fortifications. Even if the front line was lost, the rear positions would not be affected or disrupted. Currently, not only are the fortifications at Sahé Bridge, Luowenyu, and Santunying solidly built, but also in Zunhua, Shimenzhen, Mashenqiao, Jixian, Bangjun, and other places far in the rear, any location of significant military importance is undergoing the construction of various fortifications for both offense and defense. Furthermore, they are using their spare strength to help the people dig deep double-entranced caves to avoid air raids. Army Commander Song said they could defend for three years, which is still met with some skepticism, but it is certain that they will not easily give the enemy an opportunity to attack them by surprise. Secondly, the cooperation between the military and the people is noteworthy.  Regarding transportation, if military transport is insufficient, it is necessary to requisition livestock and vehicles from the people.  This is done with the consent of local officials and gentry, and local organizations represent and fairly distribute the burden to various villages (different from direct requisition), avoiding any disputes or misunderstandings.  Therefore, farmers are generally happy to help. Regarding firewood and grain, if possible, cash is given for what is obtained from the local area. Otherwise, the amount is recorded by weight for later payment when wages are received, and the local people trust this (according to representatives from various county chambers of commerce, industry, and agriculture). Regarding soldiers, private purchases and sales by soldiers are also quite common. I once saw a soldier buying a foot-care knife in a bathhouse, and the owner insisted on giving it to him for free. The soldier, feeling obligated, compensated with a larger tip to make up for it. Residents in the war zone, starting from 9 a.m., take the old and lead the young, fleeing to avoid air raids. It is not until 4 or 5 p.m. that they return and open the market for trade, which can last until 9 or 10 p.m. Most of those trading are soldiers, and so far, they have been getting along well. Other examples include villagers voluntarily carrying wounded soldiers, repairing roads, assisting in patrols, donating food, etc., all as a result of military-civilian cooperation. Thirdly, discipline is strict. Formally, officers and soldiers have clearly defined ranks, but in spirit, they are like family, fathers and sons. There are no deserters in peacetime, and even fewer who retreat in battle. If officers or soldiers at the front go to the rear on official business, they must have a pass; otherwise, they are considered as retreating in battle. Approximately two hundred defeated soldiers from a certain division at Lengkou came to request refuge. Although their situation was understood and they were allowed to be reorganized, they were severely disciplined when they were incorporated into the ranks. These defeated soldiers were so grateful that they wept. Division and regimental commanders are equipped with broadswords like soldiers when they go to the front lines. They lead by example in battle, and those who retreat cannot escape machine-gun fire. Fourthly, education is practical. The army's education has always emphasized the ability to endure hardship as the primary requirement. On March 8th, they rushed to Xifengkou from the rear, covering one hundred seventy or eighty miles overnight to take over the defense from Wan Jun. They were still able to fight hard and work diligently on fortifications, which is based on this principle. Furthermore, since the September 18th Incident (Mukden Incident), the training center has been focused on the slogan of resisting Japan to the death. The National Humiliation Song is sung every morning and evening, and important and concrete slogans for resisting Japan and saving the country are printed in red ink on small, neat oilcloth squares. Officers and soldiers all wear and recite them to deepen their hatred for the enemy and strengthen their determination to resist Japan to the death. The above four points are indeed the actual situation observed by the reporter. I will not elaborate on other matters. In addition, the hardships of the war zone and the situation of the people are, I believe, deeply concerned by the entire country. Please allow me to describe it. As the saying goes, "Where a lion or tiger lies, the grass dies three feet."  The impoverished countryside cannot sustain a long-term military presence. If a comprehensive plan and continuous relief are not devised quickly, once resources are exhausted, what future can we expect? Taking Zunhua County as an example, supplies began in July of last year and have continued for nine months. Currently, the entire county has dispatched 1,500 carts and 3,000 cart drivers. Each cart has three head of livestock, valued at 500 yuan, for a total of 1,500 carts valued at 750,000 yuan. There are also 2,000 pack mules used for military transport on rough mountain roads. Each mule is valued at 100 yuan, for a total of 200,000 yuan. In just one month, 25 million catties of firewood were used, each 100 catties valued at one yuan, for a total of 250,000 yuan. Just within the city, 80,000 catties of firewood are needed daily. The materials for setting up military telephones were also advanced by the county government, costing 2,000 yuan. Chambers of commerce and agricultural associations have advanced over 200,000 catties of bran, and other miscellaneous expenses total over 100,000 yuan. Outside the county, this is not included. Over ten thousand civilians have assisted in the construction of fortifications, all dispatched by the people without any monetary compensation. Under the heading of income, only General Zhu Ziqiao allocated 1,000 yuan, and most of the rest is credit or advanced by the local government. The military authorities originally said that they would repay the full amount when they received military pay, but the army has only received pay for February. Although morale was boosted with a bonus issued after the rear area made a visit of support, generals only received twelve yuan, colonels eight yuan, captains four yuan, and each soldier only one yuan. If the army were to fulfill its promises in full, it would be akin to robbing Peter to pay Paul. Currently, the local people only hope that the rear will make every effort to provide military supplies and material assistance so that the war will proceed smoothly and end soon, and that the dispatched laborers, horses, and vehicles will not fall into enemy hands like the seven large carts requisitioned by the previous Wan Jun, and that both people and animals will be able to safely return to their homes. This is all they wish for. The three districts outside Luowenyu Pass, with a circumference of approximately 160 square li, were once occupied by the enemy. Although they have withdrawn, all the food supplies have been burned. The remaining people are extremely poor and beg for food inside the pass, but they are afraid of being suspected of being spies and have to endure hunger and cold, awaiting death with outstretched necks. In other places, such as Biezichuan Town in Jixian County, there are only about twenty businesses. Due to the sluggish business, unable to keep up with military supplies, they have closed down one after another, leaving only three or five. A certain shop has now applied to close down, selling its assets. After the chamber of commerce approved a donation of 800 yuan, it was able to close its doors for good. Agriculture is desolate, spring plowing is hindered, businesses are suspended, and workers have no work to do. The entire working masses have nothing to eat or wear and are constantly under the threat of shelling and bombing. Zunhua County is like this, and one can imagine what other counties are like. Currently, the people in the war zone, seeing that the 29th Army has been fighting for a long time, its troops are exhausted, and its losses are increasing, are deeply afraid of being taken advantage of by the enemy. Therefore, they have jointly appealed to the government to quickly transfer strong troops, such as those led by Liang Guanying, to come to reinforce them day and night, hoping for this very eagerly. Furthermore, the Red Swastika Society risks transporting wounded soldiers and has purchased over fifty mu of burial land near Shimenzhen to bury fallen soldiers, already reaching over two hundred families. These can still be seen along the way. The YMCA provides tea along the way, and this charitable act is commendable. The roads are rough and transportation is difficult, which is indeed a major shortcoming. As the saying goes, "Without wind, three feet of dust; with a light rain, a road full of mud." It is also said, "Sunny days are like incense burners, rainy days are like sauce jars," which is a vivid description of this road ("cannot be traveled"). If they are not constantly repaired and more military vehicles are prepared, the transport of military supplies and provisions will rely only on the slow movement of mules and carts, and the supply to the front will inevitably be greatly affected. However, all of this cannot rely solely on the residents of the war zone, who are already extremely impoverished, to take off their clothes and share their food, and to single-handedly shoulder this huge responsibility. It all depends on the people of our entire country quickly recognizing the imminent danger of national and racial extinction and responding with a spirit of total national mobilization to provide all kinds of substantial assistance.</p>
<h3>Zhangjiakou: Deathly Stillness</h3>
<p>Special Correspondent Guo An from this Newspaper</p>
<p>The slow train, moving like a snail, finally reached Zhangjiakou at 8:15 p.m. After being surrounded by wind and sand and amidst the passengers' cursing atmosphere, the train, panting heavily, stopped at the station as lights shone in all directions. After another chaotic and noisy period, I vaguely walked onto the dusty street, squeezed into a hotel, and then lay down and fell soundly asleep. When the sun had climbed high, I finally woke up. In this way, the entire Zhangjiakou, surrounded by mountains, came into view. The disorderly dirt streets and the tall camels reflected the unique scenery outside the pass. Although Mongols dressed in red and green could be seen everywhere in this desolate border area, readers, can you imagine</p>
<h2>Page 7</h2>
<p>that there are also female waitresses in restaurants with bound feet of three inches?</p>
<p>Zhangjiakou's earthen city is divided into upper and lower sections, which locals call the Upper Fort and Lower Fort. The Chahar Provincial Government is located inside the Upper Fort. Tall brick walls surround narrow alleys, and two-wheeled carts and rickshaws often get entangled and curse each other in the alleys. The Qing River flows between the station and the earthen fort. There are two bridges over it. One is called the Qinghe Bridge, built in the fourteenth year of the Republic (1925), with calligraphy by Zhang Zhijiang. The one to the east is a smaller bridge. Currently, there is no water in the river, and sand and stones are rolling. Previously, there were three Peking opera theaters, but they are now all tightly closed. Prostitutes still lurk in small earthen courtyards, and the Suzhou troupes still hold sway. Yian Street is the most prosperous street, with as many as two photo studios. Burials are still quite elaborate here, and weddings are even more lively. The bride still wears a phoenix coronet and embroidered robe, almost like on a stage. The common people all exhibit a spirit of enduring hardship and hard work. At the foot of the mountains to the east are large barracks built during Feng Yuxiang's time. It is now said that no one lives there. I did not go there to take a look. Slogans and slogans are everywhere, dazzling, mostly centered on Han-Mongol unity against Japan. There are also many slogans in Mongolian.</p>
<p>In the northwest corner of the town is Cishan Mountain. According to legend, a certain Ming Dynasty official came to the temple on the mountain to pray for a son, and it happened immediately, hence the name Cishan Mountain and Temple. Inside, there are two ice springs, which are still frozen with large blocks of ice. The water is clear and cold. While in the temple, I drank tea brewed with that spring water. The pavilions and walls on the mountain are covered with the names and great works left by tourists. In addition, there are slogans against Christianity and chalk slogans cursing Northeast Army soldiers. Standing on the highest hilltop, I looked around, and the entire town of Zhangjiakou was in sight. However, the air in Zhangjiakou was deathly still. On this rare clear morning, it was even more like a graveyard.</p>
<p>The Great Wall on the northeastern and northwestern mountains, the yellow earthen walls, undulate weakly. The round beacon towers have also lost their former majesty. Only the air defense positions built by the current Chairman Liu have replaced their responsibility. However, this deathly still Zhangjiakou, arrayed among the mountains, is naturally dangerous, controlling the transportation of the northwest and greatly affecting strategic gains and losses. People of the country, pay attention to this gateway!</p>
<h3>Fang Zhenwu Leads Troops to the Front Lines</h3>
<p>Zhang and Bao's Divisions Have Arrived in Jin County</p>
<p>Bao Gang Denies Breaking Away from Fang's Command</p>
<p>Fang Discusses His Troops Heading to Xifengkou</p>
<p>North Ping Communication: A letter from Jin County states that Zhang Renjie's division of Fang Zhenwu's troops departed from Ningjin County on the 11th and advanced into Jin County, heading north along the newly built military road for motor vehicles. The vanguard, led by Brigade Commander Song Tielin, arrived in the county town in the afternoon. Division Commander Zhang also arrived in the fading light and stayed overnight in the city. They departed on the 12th, passing through Shenze and Baoding, to proceed to the front lines. Bao Gang's division also departed from Zhao County on the 12th and entered Jin County. Fang himself, accompanied by Brigade Commanders Wang and Zhao, arrived together. They rested briefly at Zhou Tou Town in the county at noon and stayed overnight in the city in the afternoon. Fang was wearing a gray military uniform, cloth shoes, and cloth socks, appearing very simple and unadorned, with a dark complexion and good spirits. He told reporters, "I (Fang referring to himself) was originally ordered to go to Jiangxi to suppress the Communists. However, due to the invasion of the violent Japanese and the imminent demise of the nation, I decided to voluntarily request to go north. It is the duty of a soldier to defend against foreign aggression. At this time of foreign emergency, I cannot shirk my responsibility. My trip north this time has absolutely no political color and no background. I stand entirely on the position of the people, wanting to go to Xifengkou to recover lost territory and wash away national shame with my blood and heads. Victory would glorify the nation, and defeat would not disqualify me from being a national hero, a hero of the times."</p>
<p>Another letter from Anguo County states that Bao Gang's division, which was previously rumored to have broken away from Fang Zhenwu, is now gradually concentrating in the area of Liaoxian, Heshun, Xiyang, and Shijiazhuang Anguo. A unit has already made contact with Fang, and Bao has telegraphed that he has always been under Fang's leadership and is thoroughly committed to resisting Japan. The original telegram states, "(For the appraisal of all national newspapers, all legal entities, and all people of the country: I, Gang, have followed Fang for fifteen years. In the past, I participated in every battle for the revolution. Now that the Japanese寇 (a derogatory term for Japanese) are invading deeply and the country is on the verge of destruction, it is precisely when our soldiers should dedicate themselves to the country and take up arms to resist aggression. Last month, I telegraphed my support for Fang's leadership in resisting Japan, which I believe people at home have seen and heard. Unexpectedly, on the 9th of this month, various newspapers in Pingjin reported that Gang had led his troops to break away from Fang. Upon reading this, I was extremely shocked. This reversal of right and wrong and spreading of rumors must have come from the mouths of Japanese collaborators, trying to alienate the forces resisting Japan and achieve their evil intentions, which is truly hateful. On the 20th of last month, I was ordered to go to Bing (Taiyuan) to negotiate everything. All of Brigade Commander Wang Zhongfu's brigade, together with my Third Route Army, followed the headquarters out of Handan. Qiao Mingli's brigade and the units directly under my command were ordered to depart from Xiangyuan, passing through Liaoxian, Heshun, and Xiyang, and exit Ling Shou and Quyang, heading north in separate directions to be swift and avoid congestion of large armies and disturbing the people's livelihood. The rumors may have originated from this. Now, because the rumors are untrue and cause the enemy to ridicule us, I am issuing this telegram to clarify, hoping for your understanding. Commander Bao Gang of the Second Route Army of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Army, respectfully seals this.)"</p>
<h3>Japanese Residents Create Trouble in Jinan</h3>
<p>Because a Store Displayed Anti-Japanese Shirts</p>
<p>They Smashed the Store and Assaulted the Staff</p>
<p>A visitor from the Jinan business community reports that the Ju Xingcheng Department Store on Er Ma Road, Zhongshi Weisi Road (the center of Jinan's finest commercial area) on the east side of the road, recently received a shipment of goods from Tianjin, including a type of military shirt made of cloth with the four characters "Determined to Resist Japan" printed in red on it. The store displayed it in its window. At 10 a.m. on the 19th, three Japanese people passed by, two dressed in Western clothing and one dressed in something resembling Chinese uniform, wearing a belt. Upon seeing the shirts in the window, they lingered for a moment and went straight into the store. The staff greeted them warmly. The Japanese people, speaking broken Chinese, asked where the shirts came from and how much they cost. The staff, realizing that they were Japanese, fearing trouble, replied that they were just samples from Tianjin, each costing one yuan. The Japanese people smiled sinisterly and left Ju Xingcheng. The manager of the store, sensing something suspicious, instructed the staff to put the shirts away. Before they could finish packing them away, just three minutes later, the three Japanese people stormed back, falsely claiming to buy the shirts and wanting to take them all out. The staff politely said that there was only this one sample. The Japanese people became furious, took out hemp ropes from their waists, and removed their belts to beat them wildly, declaring that they would tie them up. Several staff members were injured, the goods were smashed, and one glass window was broken. The staff wanted to go outside to call the police, but the Japanese people blocked their way. Fortunately, one clever person climbed over the wall from the back yard into the adjacent Lao Jinzhang Silk Store and immediately reported to the second public security bureau of the concession. The public security bureau reported by telephone to the general bureau, and the general bureau reported to the garrison headquarters, requesting that personnel be sent to mediate at the store. However, the Japanese people continued to destroy things, shouting "Beat them to death!" Many of the store staff were bleeding from their heads and faces. Only after the police arrived to mediate did the Japanese people leave reluctantly. The store has reported this smashing incident to the public security bureau and the municipal government. It is said that the municipal government has also lodged a protest with the Japanese consulate, and the Japanese consulate has sent people to investigate. However, the outcome is still unknown.</p>
<h3>National Defense of Qinghai, Xikang, and Tibet</h3>
<p>Talks After the Wei Shuping Investigation</p>
<p>Building Roads to Develop Transportation is Urgent</p>
<p>Chongqing Communication: In recent years, the central government has attached great importance to national defense in the Northwest, but there are still no fundamental defense facilities, leading to prolonged unresolved disputes in Qinghai, Xikang, and Tibet, and providing an opportunity for foreigners to exploit. The Guangdong-Guangxi area previously had the organization of an investigation group for Qinghai, Xikang, and Tibet, with more than fifty members, who went to Qinghai, Xikang, and Tibet for on-site investigations, lasting nine months. The group has now returned to Chongqing. According to group leader Wei Shuping, the problems of Qinghai, Xikang, and Tibet are very detailed, and the following is recorded: Mr. Wei said that if we want to resolve the disputes in Qinghai, Xikang, and Tibet, develop the Northwest, and focus on national defense, the most important thing is to develop transportation and facilitate transportation, and we should first build a highway from Lanzhou to Yushu, because this road is extremely important. For example, regarding Qinghai, Qinghai's political power is still mostly controlled by Tibetan or Mongolian princes, who treat central government orders as if they don't exist. The lives of the people are still primitive and nomadic, and their thinking is shrouded in the most intense superstition. If the progress of transportation is not urgently sought, then the so-called change of province is just an empty name. As for the relationship between this road and Xikang and Tibet, the people of Xikang and Tibet have been deceived by British imperialism in recent years and have been acting erratically from time to time. If the fundamental solution to the problems of Xikang and Tibet is sought, it is better to emphasize Qinghai than Sichuan, because recovering Xikang and Tibet from Dajianlu is not as quick as the southern Liao route. Going southwest from Xining to Yushu can cut off the waist of Xikang and Tibet and pose the greatest threat. If transportation is convenient, it is as easy as turning one's hand to stabilize Xikang and Tibet. As for the relationship with Xinjiang, Qinghai is located between Xikang and Tibet and Xinjiang, and Lanyu (Lanzhou-Yushu) is the backbone of Qinghai. If branch roads are completed, it will be a strong support for the new province and will scare the Russians, preventing them from crossing the Altai Mountains and peeking at the peaks of the Tianshan Mountains. Moreover, the Tibetans, incited by the British, have a wild ambition to combine the three provinces of Qinghai, Xikang, and Tibet into one, and more than ten counties in Xikang have already been occupied by Tibetan troops. This time, they took advantage of the Northeast being invaded by the violent Japanese to launch troops into Qinghai to seize all of Xikang and Yushu in Qinghai as a basis for future political activities. If our government's goals for the border areas still do not add the slightest construction, I am afraid there will be regret too late. Moreover, Yushu is an important town in Qinghai. Its county seat, Jegu, is only four or five horse stations away from Chamdo and Dege in Xikang. The distance is not far, and they are interdependent. If the problems of Xikang and Tibet are to be fundamentally solved, it is not enough to send troops from Qinghai to garrison here without calculating a sure victory. In terms of its geographical location, Yushu occupies an important position in the military affairs of Xikang and Tibet. Previously, Tibetan troops used all their strength to occupy Nangqian and Dasumang and Xiaosumang and besieged Jegu, and all of Yushu was almost lost. Fortunately, the Yushu defense soldiers fought bravely and managed to avoid losing it. In short, if measures are not taken urgently now to strengthen management, we will inevitably follow the same path as the Northeast. Furthermore, Qinghai's interior is vast and desolate, with sparse population. Fishing, mining, agriculture, and animal husbandry are either abandoned or undeveloped. If there is a highway, transportation will be convenient, and immigrants can be gradually settled, promoting the development of industries. It is not just for consolidating the national defense of Xikang and Tibet. (April 20)</p>
<h3>Unscrupulous Levies and Exactions by Sichuan Provincial Warlords</h3>
<p>Land Taxes Have Been Collected Up to the 60th Year of the Republic (1971)</p>
<p>Using the Pretext of Suppressing the Communists, They Increased Levies by Over 40 Million</p>
<p>Local Folk Songs Prove the Suffering of the People</p>
<p>Chongqing Communication: Sichuan provincial warlords use the defense zone system to wantonly levy and exact taxes. All land taxes have been collected up to the 60th year of the Republic (1971), and there are also so-called temporary military expenses, subsidies, loans, and other items, as well as countless checkpoints, creating a situation of a checkpoint every five steps and a toll booth every ten steps. From Chongqing to Chengdu, a distance of one thousand li, there are as many as three hundred large and small toll booths. From this, it can be seen that the rural economy of Sichuan has been declared bankrupt. All the products are almost entirely scraped away by the warlords. Even Chengdu and Chongqing, known as large commercial ports, have become bleak and desolate due to the warlords' harsh levies of donations and extortion of military expenses. Recently, the Communist bandits (a derogatory term for Communists) scurried into Sichuan. The various armies not only failed to unite consistently to quickly eliminate them, but instead used this as an excuse to levy donations to fill the expenses of suppressing the Communists. It is estimated that Yang Sen of the 20th Army raised 2 million yuan because of this, Liu Xiang of the 21st Army raised 20 million yuan, Liu Wenhui of the 24th Army raised over 7 million yuan, Deng Xihou of the 20th Army raised over 3 million yuan, Tian Songyao of the 29th Army raised about 10 million yuan, and Liu Cunhou of the Sichuan-Shaanxi Army raised over 1 million yuan. As a result, the Sichuan people suddenly increased their burden by over 42 million. Liu Xiang, in order to expand the scope and strength of his army and prepare for unifying the Sichuan situation, intensified his efforts, levying an additional 30 yuan in military expenses, 20 yuan in surcharges, 10 yuan in temporary assessments, 6 yuan 2 in smoke field tax, and 6 yuan 5 in group fees for every斗 (dou, a unit of dry measure) of grain in addition to the regular tax of 6 yuan. This is based on the regular supply, meaning that every斗 (dou) of grain already bears the burden of more than 70 yuan in levies. As for the various districts, townships, and even villages and hamlets, following the trend, they also exploit the people, adding assessments in turn at will. There are those who pay over 90 yuan or over 100 yuan for one斗 (dou) of grain. Moreover, county governments and group affairs personnel collect taxes, often resorting to harsh dunning, locking up people, and illegally prosecuting them. The township group affairs bureaus all have disguised card prisons. All the imprisoned people are not those who commit crimes, and nineteen are in arrears of grain taxes. Currently, the grain tax in Liu Xiang's garrison area has been collected up to the 58th year of the Republic (1969). According to Liu Xiang's declaration, it is only collected four times a year, but in reality, it is collected once a month. If another five years pass, it can be pre-collected for more than 100 years of the Republic. The people's livelihood will be cut off from this. Moreover, the yield of one斗 (dou) of farmland for the people can only harvest more than 20石 (shi, a unit of dry measure) of grain in a good year. Based on the most recent market price, each石 (shi) sells for 6 yuan, and the calculation of the proceeds is barely enough to offset the taxes. If there is a lean year, it is not even enough to supply the payment. The county magistrates who are ordered to collect taxes even have the saying (killing can be forgiven, but arrears in taxes cannot be delayed). Therefore, local folk songs say (bandits are like combing with a comb, soldiers are like combing with a fine-toothed comb, warlords are like shaving with a razor, the Communists draw sinews and scrape skin). From this, the perverse behavior of the Sichuan warlords and the suffering of the Sichuan people can be seen. (April 20)</p>
<h3>Yang and Liu Arrive in Hankou from Jiangxi</h3>
<p>Yang Discusses the Alarming Drought in Shaanxi</p>
<p>Liu Talks About the Smooth Suppression of Bandits in Jiangxi</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Yang Hucheng, Pacification Director of Shaanxi and Chairman of the Shaanxi Provincial Government, and Liu Zhenhua, Bandit Suppression Director of the Hubei-Henan-Anhui Border Region and Commander-in-Chief of the Sixteenth Route Army, were previously summoned by telegram from Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek and went to Nanchang from Shaanxi and Henan respectively. Having completed their official business, they left Nanchang on the 20th and arrived in Hankou at 11:00 AM on the 21st via the Jiang'an Steamer from Xunyang. At 2:00 PM, accompanied by Chairman Xia, they crossed the Yangtze River to Luojia Mountain and boated on East Lake. They returned to Hankou in the evening and stayed at the Pacific Hotel. They are scheduled to return to Shaanxi and Henan on the 22nd. According to a statement made by Mr. Yang, the Red Bandits in Jiangxi Province are weakening since Chairman Chiang Kai-shek went there for the second time to oversee their suppression. Xu Xiangqian's remnant forces in Sichuan are still in Tongjiang. Sun Weiru has been dispatched with troops from Shaanxi to the Sichuan border to join forces with Tian Songyao's troops to encircle and suppress them. They should be annihilated in a short period. Shaanxi has suffered from consecutive years of famine, and the people are struggling to survive. This year, there has been no rain for a long time, resulting in another drought. At most, only 20% of the autumn harvest can be expected, which is a cause for great concern. It is especially difficult to maintain the situation during this time of year when the old harvest is gone and the new harvest is not yet in. It is hoped that enthusiastic philanthropists will provide relief. The Jing Canal is currently under construction. The first phase of the project has been completed and can irrigate 400,000 mu of land. The second phase of the project will be actively carried out because it is of utmost importance to agriculture. Liu Zhenhua said that he met with Chiang Kai-shek in Jiangxi to report on defense matters and request instructions. The Seven Provinces Security Conference concluded very satisfactorily. The military suppression of bandits in Jiangxi Province has been progressing smoothly since Chiang Kai-shek went to Nanchang. Director Liu, having received support, will be stationed in Nanchang for a long time, responsible for overseeing the suppression efforts at the front. Regarding the remnant bandits on the border of Henan, Hubei, and Shaanxi, he discussed measures with Director He Chengjun when passing through Xunyang and will implement them immediately. At this time when national difficulties are urgent, the Red Bandits are taking the opportunity to cause trouble, hindering the rear, which is extremely sinful. Therefore, resisting Japan and suppressing bandits are equally important. We hope that the remnant bandits will be eradicated soon, and then we can devote all our efforts to resisting foreign aggression. He Chengjun telegraphed on the 21st, stating that he had arrived in Nanchang and heard that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek would arrange matters in Jiangxi and then go north, and He would also accompany him to assist.

<h3>Initial Plan for Guiding the Huai River</h3>
<p>Divided into Three Steps: Flood Discharge, Irrigation, and Navigation</p>
<p>Budget of 85.47 Million Yuan</p>
<p>The Huai River guiding project has been actively underway. According to the initial plan for the Huai River guiding project formulated by the Huai River Guiding Committee, the total project cost is estimated to be 85.47 million yuan. The plan is as follows: (Flood Discharge Project) (1) Regulate the Huai River along its course into the Yangtze River and guide the Huai River into Hongze Lake. The maximum inflow is 15,000 cubic meters per second, with 6,000 to 9,000 cubic meters discharged into the Yangtze River. In addition to a portion entering the sea, the remainder is stored in Hongze Lake. Open the main riverbed of the Huai River from Hongze Lake through Sanhe to Donggou Town, open a new river, head southeast into Gaoyou Lake and Tangjia Lake, and then open a new river from South Lake to Shaobo Lake and Liuzha, cross the Grand Canal, and exit the old rivers, taking the Mangdao River and Liao Jiagou to the Sanjiangying into the Yangtze River. The total length is 153 kilometers, and the project cost is 29 million yuan. (2) Movable Weirs, Ship Locks, and Fishways: A movable weir will be built southwest of Jiangba Town in Hongze Lake to regulate the lake water level and the amount of water entering the Yangtze River. The project cost is 3.5 million yuan. (3) Construction of Embankments and Culverts around Hongze Lake: Since Hongze Lake is used to intercept and store floodwater, its maximum water level may flood the surrounding farmland. It is planned to build embankments along the lake to prevent this and culverts to discharge water. The old embankments that have collapsed will be repaired. New embankments of approximately 180 kilometers in length should be built. The project cost is 1.2 million yuan. (4) Construction of Three Movable Weirs in the Middle Canal: It is planned to build them at Shengzha, Hezha, and Laodong to regulate the amount of water in the Middle Canal and the Si and Yi Rivers. The project cost is 500,000 yuan. (5) Dredging the Waterway into the Sea: The amount of Huai River water entering the sea is stipulated to be 1,500 cubic meters per second. The route is planned to start from Sunjiazhuang on the edge of Hongze Lake, follow the Zhangfu River to Zhouzhuang, then change direction to Yangzhuang, connect to the abandoned Yellow River, follow the old Yellow River trough, and cut through the bend between Yinjiadu and Jiaolingji, taking the straight route from Shangtao to Xiatao, leaving the abandoned Yellow River and entering the sea from Taozikou. It is also planned to build movable weirs and ship locks at Yangzhuang and movable weirs around Zhouzhuang. The project cost is 34.3 million yuan. The benefits of flood discharge can directly exempt approximately 20 million mu of land from floods. An average benefit donation of one jiao per mu per year would amount to approximately 2 million yuan per year. The newly dried land in Gaobao Lake is approximately 1 million mu, and the public land that has been reclaimed or not reclaimed in the abandoned Yellow River is approximately 950,000 mu. After consolidation and reclamation, the land price is estimated at 25 yuan per mu, totaling approximately 50 million yuan. The income from the benefits of flood discharge can be 50 million yuan in one lump sum and 2 million yuan annually.</p>
<p>(Irrigation Project) (1) Add New-Style Gates to Various Gates and Culverts in the Winding Canal: Because the flow rate of the Winding Canal channel can be less than the estimated amount at the beginning of development, only 50 gates are placed along the river to meet the initial irrigation needs. The project cost is 100,000 yuan. (2) Rebuild the Tongyang Canal Gates: The flow of the canal goes south to Shaobo Town, passing through the gates and entering the Tongyang Canal. However, the six gates have been in disrepair for many years and should be rebuilt to serve as inlet control points. The cost is 50,000 yuan. (3) Excavate the Main Canal from Hongze Lake to the Jing River Gate and Build the Intake Gate: The main canal from Hongze Lake to the Jing River Gate is the main canal for conveying water and the most important project for irrigation water supply. Now we will start excavating the river channel and building gates and culverts. The project cost is 2.5 million yuan. (4) Reclamation Project in the Gaobao Lake Area: When the area is reclaimed, all the soil excavated from the drainage ditches will be used to fill the embankments of the irrigation ditches, and five pumping stations will be prepared. The cost is 4.5 million yuan. (5) Excavate the Jing River Gate and the Channel from the Jing River Gate to the Chuanzhang River: The terrain east of the Jing River is very low, and the water level of the combined new channel drops by three meters to match the water level height of the Chuanzhang River. Embankments are built on both sides to contain the water. The cost is 2.2 million yuan. (6) Excavate the Channel from the Yan River to the Chuanzhang River: Open a channel from the Yan River, cross the old Yellow River, to reach the Chuanzhang River in Funing, which is approximately 48 kilometers long. The project cost is 1.1 million yuan. The benefits after irrigation are estimated at 40 million mu of land. Collecting a water donation of one jiao per mu per year would yield 4 million yuan annually.</p>
<p>(Navigation Project) (1) Build the Huaiyin and Shaobo Ship Locks: Huaiyin is the hub of the transportation network, connecting the Yangtze River to the south, Shandong to the north via the Middle Canal, the Guanhai Estuary to the east via the Yan River, and the upper reaches of the Huai River to the west via Hongze Lake. Shaobo Town is also located at the intersection of the winding canal and the flood discharge waterway into the Yangtze River, so ship locks should be built early to facilitate navigation. The cost is 750,000 yuan. (2) Dredge and Build Embankments on the Waterway from Huaian Old Zhan to Sanjiangying and from Huaiyuan to Caigong Gate: The Middle Canal from Huaian Old Zhan to Sanjiangying and the Huai River from Huaiyuan Caigong Gate are the main sections for Huaiyun navigation, so excavation and embankment reinforcement projects should be implemented first. The cost is 1.84 million yuan. (3) Build the Caigong, Xinpu, and Longgou Ship Locks: Caigong is the starting point for the diversion of the Pu River to the north, and Longgou is where the Pu River and the Yi River meet. From here, part of the Pu River water enters the Gou River and reaches the sea, and part goes north through Xinpu to the Linhongkou and enters the sea, so ship locks should be built to facilitate navigation. The cost is 900,000 yuan. (4) Build a total of Three Movable Weirs in Longgou: Three movable weirs will be built near Longgou in the Pu River, attached to the ship locks, to store water during normal times and avoid the backflow of the Yi River. The cost is 200,000 yuan. (5) Dredge and Build Embankments on the Waterway from Caigong Gate to Xinpu: The Pu River enters the sea from Linhongkou, which is located at the end of Longhai, with convenient transportation and developed commerce. Now, the Pu River from Caigong Gate to Xinpu Gate will be dredged separately, so that goods from the estuary and the interior can be transported without hindrance. The cost is 31,000 yuan. (6) Build the Huaizhan River, Ding, and Desheng Three Ship Locks: For the benefit of navigation, movable weirs should be attached to a ship lock at each location. The cost is 1.1 million yuan. (7) Dredge and Build Embankments on the Waterway from Congjiakou to Liu Lao Zhan Gate, and Rebuild the Railway Bridge: This section is approximately 187 kilometers long. It is planned to deepen the riverbed and reinforce the embankments separately. Regarding the Hanzhuang and Bulao Rivers, the original Jinpu railway bridge will be renovated.</p>
<h3>Disabled Soldiers of the 19th Route Army Return to Guangdong After Fighting Japan</h3>
<p>Representatives from All Parties Hold a Warm Welcome</p>
<p>Disabled Soldiers' Training Institute Also Holds Its Opening Ceremony</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The disabled soldiers of the 19th Route Army who fought against Japan in Shanghai recently returned south from Shanghai on the Guangli Steamer. The steamer arrived at Humen on the 15th. Because the tide was low and dry, it could not immediately sail into the Pearl River. After receiving the news, Huang Zhisheng, the director of the Disabled Soldiers' Training Institute, and staff members of the 19th Route Army's rear office in Guangdong prepared for the welcome. In the morning of the 16th, they took a boat to meet them. The disabled soldiers transferred to civilian ships at Huangpu and sailed into the provincial river in succession, landing at the pier of the Disabled Soldiers' Training Institute in Xiadutian, Henan. More than 100 representatives from various groups and agencies also went to welcome them on that day, carrying banners that read "Welcome the Disabled Soldiers of the 19th Route Army Who Fought Against Japan in Shanghai Back to Guangdong." When the disabled soldiers arrived ashore, the sound of firecrackers and cheers of "Anti-Japanese Heroes" were endless along the way. It was found that there were more than 290 soldiers and 27 officers in this group of anti-Japanese disabled soldiers, led by Zheng Guxiang. Among them, those with broken arms and legs accounted for half, and more than a dozen needed people to support them. Five or six people were carried into the hospital on canvas beds. There were old soldiers in their fifties and young men in their teens. Although their limbs were disabled, their loyalty and bravery were admirable. After entering the hospital, the person in charge of the hospital arranged for them separately. The facilities of the Disabled Soldiers' Training Institute are very comprehensive. There are more than 100 rooms. Each room has more than ten Western-style beds. All felt, tents, pillows, mats, toothbrushes, washbasins, and mouthwash cups are provided. There is a small sign on the door of each room listing the team and room number. The disabled in each room are taken care of by the management team leader and deputy team leader. There is a large swimming pool, a public dining hall, a sick room, and a dormitory for the families of the disabled soldiers in the hospital. On the day the disabled soldiers arrived at the hospital, they went upstairs to the lecture hall to hold a meeting. Weng Guiqing, the rear director of the 19th Route Army, presided over the meeting and gave words of encouragement to the soldiers. Chen Huipu, the representative of the Disabled Soldiers' Training Institute Preparatory Association, then gave a speech, followed by Mr. Weng answering and thanking on behalf of the soldiers. The representatives of the welcome dispersed at about 4:00 PM.</p>
<p>As for the Shanghai Anti-Japanese Disabled Soldiers' Training Institute of the 19th Route Army, it was initiated and built by all walks of life. Since its preparation, it has been deeply supported and planned by the military and political authorities, and various groups have also enthusiastically assisted. Li Fulin, the former commander of the Fifth Army, also lent a piece of land in Datang, Henan, to build the institute, and the scale was prepared. Now that the disabled soldiers have returned to Guangdong, the preparatory members held the opening ceremony of the institute on the 18th and officially held a meeting to welcome the disabled soldiers. More than 2,000 representatives from all parties and representatives from Hong Kong attended the meeting. The presidium publicly elected Liu Jiwen as the chairman and announced the reasons for the meeting. Then, Weng Guiqing, the standing committee member of the preparatory committee, reported on the preparation process, stating that this time, the hospital issued more than 1,000 donation books. (1) In the province: (A) All agencies and groups in the province were distributed by their respective competent agencies. (B) The Guangzhou Chamber of Commerce specially recognized donations from various businesses, and the preparatory committee sent people to jointly solicit ordinary donations. The leaders of the Guangzhou Charity Association, Chen Huipu, He Zizhen, and Chen Helian, initiated the organization of the Guangzhou Preparatory Association to assist in the process. (2) Overseas: The Philippines and various ports in Nanyang took advantage of Mr. Zou Minchu's visit to the Southern Seas on behalf of the 19th Route Army to慰勞overseas Chinese to carry 200 donation books and distributed them by port. The Americas and Vietnam were directly mailed by the preparatory committee, asking the leaders of various overseas Chinese groups to solicit donations. (3) Hong Kong and Macau: The preparatory committee member ordered Weng Guiqing to contact them. Preparatory associations were formed in Hong Kong and Macau. Since the donation books were issued, remittances have been coming in continuously. As of now, about 300,000 yuan has been collected. As for the site of the hospital, it is the old site of the Henan Hospital in Xiadutian, Henan, which was originally built by Li Dengtong, the former commander of the Fifth Army. It is now permanently borrowed for the use of the Disabled Soldiers' Training Institute, but the outstanding amount of 20,000 yuan for the incomplete project is still needed for continuous construction. After the report, Huang Zhisheng, the director of the Disabled Soldiers' Training Institute, was sworn into office, followed by a speech by Cai Tingkai, the commander-in-chief of the 19th Route Army, who encouraged the disabled soldiers and thanked the guests and representatives from all parties for their assistance. Finally, the outstanding representatives of the disabled soldiers gave an answer. More than 20 Hong Kong groups came to the province to participate in the grand ceremony, and one of the representatives immediately donated 1,000 yuan to the hospital, which can be said to be a righteous act.

<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Suzhou Lun Factory Did Not Lay Off Workers</p>
<p>In order to comply with the resolution of the National Yarn Association meeting to reduce working hours, the Suzhou Lun Textile Factory outside Panmen stopped a little less than one-quarter of all the yarn spindles in the two factories yesterday. The double-stranded thread spindles were completely stopped, and some of the ordinary yarn spindles were also stopped. As a result, there were about 600 to 700 surplus workers. The factory was quite hesitant about this matter at first, and the local authorities also hoped that the factory would not lay them off in order to maintain their livelihoods. Later, Director Yan Qingqi found a way to give these surplus workers other jobs, so no workers were laid off after the reduction in working hours and the stopping of spindles.</p>
<h3>Preparation for Improving Sheep Breeds</h3>
<p>Xin Rural Village in Shanqu District, Wuxian County, because the village has always been a sheep-producing area in Suzhou, but the villagers have not paid attention to the improvement of sheep breeds and the utilization of wool. Now, Zhang Yiqing and Li Genyuan, the new village members, are contacting all parties to try to improve the sheep breeds in the village, so that a large amount of wool can be harvested for use by domestic wool weaving factories. Now, the Suzhou Provincial Agricultural School and general industrialists are all willing to support the project, so preparations are being made for immediate implementation.</p>

He requested the county government to find other ways to raise money. County Magistrate Cai, according to the resolution of the county administration meeting, ordered the bureau to raise 20,000 yuan first, of which 12,000 yuan would be allocated to the local tea and water fees for the Zhencheng Road project in accordance with the provincial order, and 8,000 yuan would be sent to the province to meet the necessary needs.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang Jiangsu Province Establishes Audit Branch</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government previously received an order from the central government that before the establishment of audit branches in various provinces, the provincial governments should organize their own audit committees. The members of the committee were to be concurrently appointed by the provincial committees, and the staff were to be transferred from various departments. These regulations have been stipulated by the provincial government, and preparations are now underway and are scheduled to be formally established on the 24th to review the provincial and county budgets and all expenses.</p>

<h3>Scene Upon Arrival</h3>
<p>The Russian ambassador and his wife, along with counselors and staff, arrived at the Custom House Wharf on a special welcoming ship at 4:25 PM and disembarked at 4:30 PM. The Russian Embassy's Shanghai office specially prepared three cars, numbers 11773, 5937, and test drive document number 31, parked at the exit of the Custom House Wharf for the Russian ambassador and others to ride in. When the Russian ambassador came out of the Custom House, he wore a dark brown felt hat, carried a leather bag and walking stick, and had a pleasant smile. Representatives of the Russian community presented flowers to the Russian ambassador, who then got into car number 1173 with his wife. The remaining counselors and others got into the other two cars and drove directly to the Russian Embassy office on Xinzha Road to rest.</p>
<h3>Dissolution of Parade</h3>
<p>When the Russian ambassador was getting into the car, more than a dozen White Russians suddenly tried to rush forward, but were stopped by detectives. Before the Russian ambassador arrived, representatives from various districts of the National Self-Salvation Association Against Foreign Aggression took turns giving speeches to the crowd at the wharf and shouting slogans, which had already attracted the attention of the detectives. When the Russian ambassador arrived, firecrackers were set off to welcome them. Then they formed a line and paraded west along Avenue Edward VII. At the intersection of Zhubao Road, they were dispersed by detectives, who seized the white banners and flags.</p>
<h3>Lodging at Nanyuan</h3>
<p>The Nanyuan Russian Embassy office at 1607 Hert Road, Xinzha Road, has been protected by detectives dispatched by the Public Works Department of the concession at the request of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Therefore, after the Russian ambassador landed from the Custom House Wharf and arrived at Nanyuan, the doors were tightly closed, and detectives guarded the area. It is said that Ambassador Paul has temporarily decided to stay there.</p>
<h3>Ambassador Paul's Remarks</h3>
<p>After Ambassador Paul boarded the special ship, he began to talk with Chinese and foreign reporters amidst the sound of oars. The reporter first asked about the date of his trip to Beijing to present his credentials. He replied that it had not yet been determined, but he would definitely start for Beijing within the next day or two. However, he did not want to make any remarks involving political issues before he went to Beijing to present his credentials. Then Ambassador Paul turned to other issues with the reporters. He said that he had served in the European diplomatic circles for ten years, having served as Minister to Poland and as Counselor and Secretary of the embassies in England, Germany, and Austria. This time, he was ordered to come to China to take up his new post. He passed through Japan and spent several days waiting for a ship. In addition to meeting with the Soviet Ambassador to Japan, Yurin, he did not meet with anyone else and had no other tasks. In short, his only task here is to promote friendly relations between China and Russia and to strive to make the relations between the two countries more harmonious within the scope of possibility. The Russian Embassy has decided to set up in Nanjing and temporarily set up an office in Shanghai. Finally, the reporter asked if he had heard that China already had a so-called Soviet government. Ambassador Paul replied that this also belonged to a political issue and was inconvenient to answer.</p>
<h3>Accompanying Personnel</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a total of twelve people came to Shanghai, including Ambassador Paul and his wife, the Soviet Consul in Beijing, Mr. and Mrs. Anageski, the Counselor of the Embassy, Mr. and Mrs. Baekoff, the Deputy Consul in Shanghai, Mr. and Mrs. Milikowski, and staff members. The Soviet Consul in Shanghai remained in Moscow and did not come with them.</p>
<h3>Brief Biography of the Russian Ambassador</h3>
<p>Bogomolov was born in 1890. Since 1920, he has served in the diplomatic service, having served as First Secretary of the embassies in Warsaw, Germany, and England, and as Minister to Poland. Two years ago, he was transferred to the Soviet Embassy in England as a Counselor. Last winter, with the consent of our country, he was formally appointed as the Soviet Ambassador to China.</p>

<h3>Presenting Credentials</h3>
<p>Although the Russian ambassador said yesterday that he would go to Beijing to present his credentials within a few days, according to another source, the Russian ambassador's trip to Beijing to present his credentials will probably be in early next month. According to precedent, a copy of the credentials should be sent to Beijing first, and at the same time, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs should submit a request to the Chairman of the National Government to approve the date of the audience, and then notify the Russian ambassador. The procedure is quite complicated.</p>
<h3>Chu Minyi Talks About the Central Government's Decision to Send Senior Officials to Xinjiang</h3>
<p>Resolve the Disputes Among Hui Muslims in Xinjiang</p>
<p>The Sichuan Army's Resistance Against Japan is Under Discussion</p>
<p>Chu Minyi, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, arrived in Shanghai from Beijing at 8:00 AM yesterday for official business and is scheduled to return to Beijing by night train at 11:00 PM tonight. A reporter from the New Sound News Agency specially visited him yesterday to inquire about the Xinjiang incident and how the central government will deal with it. Chu gave the following answers:</p>
<h3>The Xinjiang Incident</h3>
<p>The central government attaches great importance to the Xinjiang incident, because the province of Xinjiang occupies a very important position in terms of its large area, rich products, and the future national economy and population of China. Moreover, the province borders India and Russia and is also extremely important in terms of diplomacy. Therefore, since receiving news of the incident in the province, the central government has been planning solutions. It has now been decided to investigate the actual situation and to select senior officials to go there to resolve the issue, so that the dispute will not be further expanded. The selection of senior officials to be sent by the central government is currently being carried out by the Executive Yuan in conjunction with the Military Affairs Commission, and will be finalized by the middle of next week at the latest.</p>
<h3>Strict Order to Resist</h3>
<p>In recent days, the war on the front lines has remained severe. The central government has now telegraphed the troops stationed on the front lines, ordering them to resist to the end no matter what. In short, the enemy is advancing step by step, and our country has no way out except to resist with unity from top to bottom. There is no definite news yet as to when Chairman Chiang will leave southern Jiangxi and go north.</p>
<h3>The Sichuan Army's Resistance Against Japan</h3>
<p>Regarding the suggestion made by Zhang Qun and others, members of the Sichuan Aid Society for the Resistance Against Japan, regarding the Sichuan Army's resistance against Japan, the central government is currently discussing it. However, since it concerns the military affairs of the resistance against Japan, it is not convenient to announce how it should be handled. At this point, the reporter then inquired with Chu, and heard that the diplomatic authorities were planning to telegraph the League of Nations to convene the Advisory Committee in advance to implement effective resolutions to sanction the violent Japanese. Chu replied that he had not heard of this matter.</p>
<h3>The French Authorities Issue a Statement Yesterday Regarding the Factory Inspection Rights Case</h3>
<p>Expressing the Same Attitude as the Public Concession</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry Sends the Director of Labor Affairs to Shanghai to Negotiate</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Labor Union Also Issues a Declaration of Opposition</p>
<p>Since the Western taxpayers' association in the Public Concession passed an amendment to Annex 34 of the Yangjingbang Regulations, attempting to seize our factory inspection rights, it has aroused much attention from all walks of life. At the same time, the French Municipal Council also issued a statement yesterday, expressing the same attitude as the Public Concession. To this end, the Ministry of Industry has sent the Director of Labor Affairs, Bao Huaguo, to Shanghai. The Shanghai General Labor Union also issued a declaration of opposition yesterday. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Statement from the French Authorities</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of implementing factory inspections in the concession, the French Concession authorities issued a solemn statement yesterday, stating that the French Municipal Council takes the same attitude as the Public Concession regarding the Chinese government's request to implement the Factory Inspection Law in the concession. Moreover, the French Municipal Council now has a plan to authorize the French Municipal Council to carry out factory inspections. Before the Chinese authorities promulgated the Factory Inspection Law, the French Concession authorities already had regulations to govern the factories in the concession. According to these regulations, if someone wants to build a new factory, they must obtain the permission of the French Municipal Council. The French Municipal Council must first pay attention to whether the factory has hygiene and fire prevention equipment before issuing a license. The caution and rigor of the procedure can be imagined. Now, if the Chinese government believes that the factory management regulations implemented by the French Concession are in conflict with the Factory Law promulgated by the Chinese government, the French Municipal Council will also negotiate with the Chinese authorities in a spirit of friendship to change them. However, this type of change is limited to improving the existing regulations and cannot change the entire spirit of the regulations.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Industry Seeks Negotiation</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Industry believes that the Public Concession's Municipal Council's seizure of factory inspection rights is actually undermining our country's entire labor administration. In order to understand the truth of the case and to facilitate negotiations, it has specially sent the Director of Labor Affairs, Bao Huaguo, to Shanghai to conduct an investigation and to agree on a plan with the municipal government. It is learned that the negotiation method is divided into two steps. The first step is for the municipal government to directly negotiate with the Municipal Council. If a satisfactory solution cannot be obtained, the second step will be to consult the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and lodge a serious protest based on legal facts.</p>
<h3>Declaration of the General Labor Union</h3>
<p>Since the development of mechanical industry, various safety facilities in factories have become an important issue. Therefore, advanced countries in Europe and the United States all have special laws to protect the safety of workers' lives. Although our country had similar laws promulgated during the era of the Northern Warlords, they were not implemented. Therefore, the equipment in various factories is mostly simple and makeshift. Workers work hard under the rumble of machines, and the danger is unimaginable. Since the establishment of the National Government, it has paid close attention to labor welfare and has successively promulgated the Factory Law and the Factory Inspection Law to improve the lives of laborers. Recently, the Ministry of Industry also established a training school for factory inspectors to train this type of talent and sent them to various places to carry out inspections. The initial inspection work has been completed in the Chinese-controlled areas of this city, but the factories in the special zone have not been able to implement it due to the Municipal Council's obstruction. The Association has previously declared its opposition. The concession authorities have intensified their efforts and even proposed amending Annex 34 of the Yangjingbang Regulations in this session of the Western taxpayers' meeting, hoping to usurp our factory inspection rights, which is unfounded in law and reason. The concession is our country's territory, and our government has its own independent spirit of rule of law. The Chinese-owned factories in the concession should be bound by the laws of our country. Moreover, Chinese taxpayers in the concession account for more than 95%, and all facilities in the concession should be subject to the opinions of the majority. Now, a very small number of Western taxpayers are arbitrarily amending the land charter, which is illegal, to say the least. In order to uphold national legal rights and protect the interests of laborers, the Association is willing to do its best to resolutely oppose this illegal act of the Municipal Council, which exceeds its authority and undermines our country's administrative power. It is hoped that the government will continue to proceed with an indomitable spirit. This is our declaration.</p>
<h3>The National Goods Association Expresses</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Citizens' Association for the Promotion of National Goods believes that the Municipal Council's seizure of factory inspection rights is a matter of concern to the overall interests of national goods factories. At the regular meeting yesterday, it was decided to issue a declaration, resolutely oppose it, and hold a general meeting of all industrial and commercial factory members at the Nine Mu Di Clubhouse at 3:00 PM on the 27th of this month to discuss effective measures to protect national rights. The declaration is recorded as follows: The Municipal Council of the Public Concession in this city, based on a small amount of tax revenue and the Western taxpayers' meeting of the citizens, decided to amend the annex to the Yangjingbang Regulations, attempting to seize factory inspection rights and to exploit the freedom of Chinese people to open factories in the concession by means of licensing, implementing a new economic aggression and destroying our country's policy of national goods production. The Association, in order to protect the dignity of our country's entire national law and the interests of all national goods factories, will naturally oppose this illegal and infringing act. Factory inspection is an urgent task in an industrial society, and the Factory Inspection Law is a national law of the entire country. Since the concession is our country's territory, the Municipal Council has no right to prevent our government from enforcing its own laws within the territory, and even less can it overstep its authority to carry out factory inspections. Now, the Municipal Council has absolutely no legal basis in the Yangjingbang Regulations, exposing its ambition to seize the right to inspect factories. It not only infringes on our country's sovereignty and undermines our country's laws, but also conflicts with international conventions. This is intolerable. This Association, as a group of national goods factories, has a responsibility to resolutely and severely act as a strong support against the illegal and ultra vires acts of the Municipal Council in inspecting factories. This is a solemn declaration.</p>
<h3>Chinese Cotton Mills Continued to Reduce Working Hours Yesterday</h3>
<p>Currently Negotiating with Financial Circles for Relief Measures</p>
<p>First Seek to Sell Off Existing Inventory and Then Strive for Recovery</p>
<p>After the National Chinese Cotton Mill Joint Conference decided on a plan to reduce working hours, all Chinese cotton mills across the country, except for Tianjin, which temporarily postponed implementation due to the tension of the Luanzhou War, have complied with the implementation. Mayor Wu telegraphed President Wang in Beijing to convene a meeting of relevant ministries. The Cotton Mill Joint Association and the municipal government both sent representatives to Beijing. The Ministry of Railways sent the Director of Business Affairs to Shanghai and scheduled a meeting today to discuss relief measures with the silk and yarn industries. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Continued Suspension of Work</h3>
<p>The Shenxin, Hengfeng, and other Chinese cotton mills in this city followed the resolution of the Joint Conference and adopted the method of suspending work on Saturday and Sunday day and night shifts after implementing the reduction of working hours from the previous day. Yesterday was Sunday, and all the cotton mills stopped working. The supervisory committee members temporarily appointed by the Cotton Mill Joint Association, Xue Chunsheng, Li Shengbo, and Huang Zhimin, went to various factories yesterday morning to inspect the situation.</p>
<h3>Discussing Relief Measures</h3>
<p>The Chinese Cotton Mill Joint Conference decided to reduce working hours in order to reduce production and implemented it on the 22nd. Chinese cotton mills across the country unanimously suspended work. The Central Party Department and the Ministry of Industry specially sent commissioners to Shanghai to discuss relief measures. The municipal government convened two meetings and Mayor Wu decided to telegraph the Executive Yuan, requesting President Wang to convene a meeting of the ministers of industry, finance, railways, and other relevant departments on the morning of the 25th. The Shanghai Municipal Government also sent personnel to Beijing to participate in the discussions. It is heard that the cotton mill side has already elected Rong Zongjing, Nie Lusheng, Guo Shun, and Zhang Zemin to go to Beijing at the annual meeting of the Cotton Mill Joint Association.</p>
<h3>Nie Lusheng Talks</h3>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that the National Cotton Mill Joint Association decided to temporarily reduce working hours in order to maintain operations due to the dumping of foreign goods and the decline in business. It will also send representatives to Beijing to appeal for relief in order to avoid collapse. This morning, the reporter went to the Hengfeng Cotton Mill on Ningbo Road and met with Mr. Nie Lusheng to inquire in detail about the cause of this incident and the hopes for the government. He gave a detailed reply, which is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Amount of Investment</h3>
<p>There are 82 cotton mills in the country, with 2.5 million spindles. The installation cost per spindle is about 40 yuan, for a total of 10 million yuan. Other items such as factory buildings cost about 5 million yuan. There are 170,000 workers and the monthly output of yarn is more than 1 million bales. Although this industry is still in its infancy, its economic position in China, which is backward in industry and commerce, should not be underestimated.</p>
<h3>Dismal History</h3>
<p>Although the history of our country's cotton textile industry is very short, its experience is very dismal. Since the end of the European War in 1919, for the past ten years, countries in Europe and the United States have been affected by the economic downturn. Even with the support and encouragement of the government, they have still been unable to avoid suspending operations and going bankrupt. This has been particularly common in recent years. However, our country's manufacturers have not received attention from the people or assistance from the government. They were able to survive in this precarious situation because the tide of the economic downturn had not yet reached the west coast of the Pacific Ocean. However, the suffering they went through was something that the people could not have foreseen. When the May 30th Massacre occurred in 1925, the concession's power plant stopped supplying electricity, and the factories were forced to stop working. In 1927, the workers' movement flourished, and factories were often forced to stop working due to gatherings. Although the factories went through these hardships, they still tried their best to maintain operations.</p>
<h3>Dumping of Foreign Goods</h3>
<p>The difficulties and dangers of domestic factories are as described above. This time, the decision to reduce working hours was made due to unavoidable difficulties. Merchants from various countries are affected by the economic downturn and are supported by their governments to engage in dumping, especially Japan. They have gained great influence in the markets of India and the United States. Their influence is even stronger in our country's market. It is a pity that the people do not know the fierceness of their arrival. The small reduction in working hours is just a cloud in the clear sky. If the people do not know that the storm is coming and take precautions in advance, they may not be able to avoid it when it comes.</p>
<h3>Reduce Working Hours First</h3>
<p>The reduction of night work throughout the country accounts for about 20% of the total. However, in terms of cost accounting, it actually increases by 30%. This is because the output is reduced, but all expenses cannot be saved. The reason for doing so is that on the one hand, it is hoped that it will stimulate merchants in various places to order existing inventory, so as to promote circulation. On the other hand, it is also to show that the crisis is brewing and erupting. This reduction in working hours plan will be tried for two weeks and then a meeting will be convened to discuss it again. However, if the government does not have a comprehensive plan, it may not be able to alleviate the difficulties.</p>
<h2>Page 9</h2>
<h3>Hope for Assistance</h3>
<p>The ability of industry and commerce in various countries to invade foreign markets is due to economic assistance and government support. The advantages and disadvantages are even greater than military aggression. Domestic factory owners are at the front lines of this economic war, resisting aggression. They must have strong support. However, the government does not pay attention and the people are also ignorant. How can a lone army fight hard and defeat the enemy? Moreover, it is not possible to overcome this difficulty by providing subsidies only to the cotton textile industry. It is hoped that the government will decide on a comprehensive strategy for the country's industries in order to increase the resistance of industry and commerce.</p>
<h3>Yu Tan Talks</h3>
<p>The Minister of Railways, Gu Mengyu, believes that the reduction of working hours in our country's cotton mills is due to the overproduction of domestic cotton yarn and the poor sales channels. It is related to the purpose of railway transportation and regulation. Yesterday, he specially sent Yu Tan, Director of the Business Affairs Department of the Ministry, to Shanghai to convene a meeting of the silk and yarn industries to discuss relief measures. Director Yu is scheduled to invite representatives of the silk and yarn industries to the Huaan Building at 4:00 PM today to discuss relief plans. It is heard that Director Yu said that the Ministry of Railways originally had preferential measures for the freight rates of Chinese cotton yarn, which were calculated and charged according to ordinary freight rates. This was originally intended to promote Chinese cotton yarn. This time, the reduction of working hours in cotton mills across the country is due to the poor sales of yarn and overproduction. There is no guarantee for the sale of new goods, which has made the cotton industry in the country precarious. The railway has the important responsibility of transportation and regulation and cannot sit idly by and let the domestic cotton yarn industry go bankrupt. Therefore, Minister Gu specially sent him to Shanghai to convene silk and yarn merchants for further consultations, hoping to obtain appropriate emergency relief measures on freight rates. However, tariff policy is the first portal for maintaining domestic industry. The Ministry of Finance is said to be planning to implement effective measures. The government will certainly work together to save the situation with regard to this serious situation.</p>

<h3>Groundbreaking Ceremony for the Tai Jiabao Relief Center Held Yesterday</h3>
<p>Construction to Begin Next Month, Completion Expected in Six Months</p>
<p>Initial Plans Include Establishing Departments for Elderly Care, etc.</p>
<p>The Tai Jiabao Relief Center Preparatory Committee held the groundbreaking ceremony for the center yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM at the Shugou Bridge, located at the intersection of the three counties. Chairman Gu Zhutong delivered a speech. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Reception in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Yesterday at noon, the Preparatory Committee hosted a banquet at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA for municipal officials and provincial committee members, including Gu Zhutong, Shu Shifu, Zhu Ziqiao, Jin Chensan, and Yang Weiyu. At 2:00 PM, they departed by car to Shugou Bridge, at the junction of Tai, Jia, and Bao, to attend the groundbreaking ceremony. The stations along the Shanghai-Tai Highway, including Dachang, Luodian, Liuhang, and Shugou, were decorated with colorful archways. A temporary stage was erected at the site of the Shugou Relief Center, inscribed with "Groundbreaking Ceremony of Tai Jiabao Relief Center." The route was heavily guarded by police and defense corps from Taicang, Jiading, and Baoshan counties.</p>
<h3>Groundbreaking Ceremony</h3>
<p>After Gu Zhutong and others arrived at Shugou Bridge, the groundbreaking ceremony began at 3:00 PM. Present were Taicang County Magistrate Hong, Baoshan County Magistrate Jin, Sixth District Administrative Commissioner and Jiading County Magistrate Xu Weizhen, as well as various bureau chiefs and local gentry, approximately 400 people in total. The ceremony was conducted as scheduled. First, Yang Weiyu, a member of the Preparatory Committee, reported on the preparation process. Then, Gu Zhutong, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, delivered a speech, followed by speeches by Shu Shifu, Director of the Jiangsu Department of Finance, and Zhu Ziqiao. Gu Zhutong laid the foundation stone, which was inscribed with "Foundation of Tai Jiabao Relief Center, April 23rd, Republic of China Year 22, Gu Zhutong, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government."</p>
<h3>Preparation Report</h3>
<p>Preparatory Committee Member Yang Weiyu Reports on Preparations</p>
<p>Explanation: After the January 28th Incident last year, the Jiangsu Provincial Government, gathering officials and gentry from the entire province, organized the Jiangsu Province War Zone Relief Association, which led to the organization of the Tai Jiabao Relief Center Preparatory Committee. The Preparatory Committee, under the leadership of the provincial authorities, acquired a base of more than 200 mu in Shugou, a central location for the three counties of Tai, Jia, and Bao. The price was 120 yuan per mu, plus subsidies for seedlings, cultivated land, and relocation of graves and houses, totaling more than 34,000 yuan. Today's groundbreaking is honored by the presence of Chairman Gu and the guidance of various sectors of society. This should be a thank you from the representatives of the disaster-stricken people of the three counties. We especially hope to raise funds and complete the project as soon as possible. This is even more earnestly prayed for by the disaster-stricken people of the three counties.</p>
<h3>Chairman's Speech</h3>
<p>Chairman Gu Zhutong said in his speech: "Today is the day of the groundbreaking ceremony for the Tai Jiabao Relief Center. I am here to participate, recalling that after the January 28th Shanghai War last year, the three counties of Tai, Jia, and Bao were unfortunately turned into war zones because of their location at the intersection of the Yangtze River and the sea, and adjacent to the ocean. They were bombed by enemy planes and heavy artillery. After the war, I immediately accompanied the provincial government's committee members to the war zone for on-site inspections, witnessing the disaster situation. Therefore, I invited enthusiastic local people to jointly organize the Jiangsu Province War Zone Relief Committee to discuss post-war relief plans. By last October, we decided to establish the Tai Jiabao Relief Center and established a preparatory committee, and then surveyed and determined the site. Today's groundbreaking ceremony can be regarded as a plan to help the disaster-stricken people in the war zone, which has established a foundation. In the future, all effective relief facilities can start from here. We can know that the organization and establishment of the relief center by the relief committee is originally an unavoidable and passive method. If the arrival of disasters continues unabated, although we can provide temporary relief in one area, we still cannot provide general and permanent relief. Moreover, the people have unfortunately reached the point of being helped, and have suffered greatly and lost their vitality. The only way to seek thorough relief is to save the country. The way to save the country, resist the enemy and suppress the communists, requires the efforts of the army, but also relies on the sincere cooperation of local people, so that it can be carried out smoothly. Today, seeing that the Tai Jiabao Relief Center has been prepared and the foundation of the center has been laid, this is the achievement of sincere cooperation between local people and the government. It can be seen that as long as the government and the people cooperate sincerely, there will be considerable achievements in all facilities. This is the feeling I have on the sidelines of participating in today's ceremony."</p>
<h3>Shu and Zhu's Speeches</h3>
<p>Shu Shifu, Director of the Jiangsu Department of Finance, said in his speech: "The three counties of Tai Jiabao suffered heavy disasters last year. The Jiangsu Provincial Government allocated 1 million yuan in busy Cao borrowing vouchers to handle relief. First, the Provincial Relief Association was established to meet the urgent needs at that time, and the Tai Jiabao Relief Center was also planned to have a permanent organization. I participated in all of them. All the borrowing vouchers of 1 million yuan, except for more than 300,000 yuan, and 200,000 yuan for other purposes, there are still more than 400,000 yuan, which are prepared as the relief center fund. The more there are, the bigger the business can be. I hope that the local area and the government will work together to complete it." Zhu Ziqiao said in his speech: "I have been away for nine months and have just come from the north. I suddenly had the opportunity to participate in today's groundbreaking ceremony. What I saw along the way almost made people not know that they had suffered from military disasters. This shows the speed of recovery, and also the result of the joint relief of the government and local people. I deeply believe that in another nine months, this place will be even more spectacular."</p>
<h3>Relief Plan</h3>
<p>The Dajiabao Relief Center covers an area of more than 200 mu. The groundbreaking ceremony was held yesterday. As for the house drawings, they have been drawn up. After the Preparatory Committee reviews them, construction will begin immediately. It is scheduled to be implemented next month. The entire completion is expected in half a year. The first step plan is to establish departments for elderly care, disability, infant care, and vocational training, specializing in providing relief to war-stricken people in the three counties.</p>

At 2:00 PM that afternoon, the association hosted industry associations such as mining, steel, hardware, construction, machinery, electrical appliances, cigarettes, silk, cotton textile, embroidery, carpets, paint, and other industrial and commercial industries, and more than 100 representatives attended. At the same time, Yu Yan, Director of the Business Department of the Ministry of Railways, lectured on the necessity of cooperation between agricultural, industrial, and commercial circles and the railway.

Zheng Baozhao, Chief of the Vehicle Department of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureau, lectured on the improvement of passenger and freight transportation on the two railways. The speech is recorded on the left,</p>
<h3>Yu Yan's Speech</h3>
<p>Today, our department is hosting Shanghai mining, steel, hardware, construction, machinery, electrical appliances, cigarettes, silk, cotton textile, embroidery, carpets, paint and other industries, and we are very honored by your presence. The significance of our department's opening of an exhibition in Shanghai this time is probably understood by everyone. The output along the national railways is probably also very clear to everyone after today's visit. Agriculture, industry and commerce have a significant relationship with the railway. It can also be seen a little in today's meeting. No matter which country's goods, from production to consumption, there needs to be a connection in the middle. This connection is the transportation of railways and other waterways and highways. All aspects of production and consumption can be adjusted to be average, and the balance between needs and supply can be maintained, depending on whether the transportation can fulfill its responsibilities. Because the relationship between the railway and production and consumption is extremely important, this time our department has collected as much as possible all the production conditions and provided them for the reference of various industries. On the railway side, it is hoped that all the national production and sales quantities, transportation methods, and freight rates can be displayed for the reference of various industries as a future business policy. This is the meaning of our department's opening of a railway freight exhibition. Today, I am very honored by your presence, and I cannot but explain this meaning, and at the same time, I will talk a little about the necessity of cooperation between agricultural, industrial, and commercial circles and the railway. The railway is a state-owned enterprise, and at the same time, it also bears the responsibility of promoting the national agricultural, industrial, and commercial industries. Therefore, the railway does not necessarily take the ordinary business policy as the standard of railway operation, but must take the development of various industries as a prerequisite. However, under the current economic conditions, the industrial and commercial industries in China have not yet progressed and have not yet broken away from the conditions before the 18th century. Therefore, if we want to improve agriculture, industry, and commerce, and improve agriculture, industry, and commerce, it is necessary to cooperate with the railway, and they themselves must also cooperate in division of labor. If an agriculture, he wants to promote his production capacity and the quantity of sales, first, is to ask the railway to find a way to transport it cheaply, otherwise he will not be able to transport and sell a large number of agricultural products. Therefore, from this point, we can know the importance of the relationship between the railway and agriculture. Secondly, speaking of industry, factories need raw materials and power, that is, mechanical fuels. If there is no power, industry cannot be developed, and after industrial products are created, they must be promoted to a wide market. If the railway cannot find a way to assist industry in terms of industrial raw materials, power, and finished industrial products, it will not be easy to develop. As for the merchants, they only buy from the cheapest producing area and then transport it to the largest market and the higher-priced place for consumers to use. But it must go through transportation procedures, so it also needs to cooperate with the railway. From the above points of view, no matter what industry, agriculture, industry or commerce, there is a need to cooperate with the railway. If the railway cannot fulfill its responsibilities, the result is that the various industries are not developed. Now let me give an example. Recently, the national economy has declined, the rural areas have gone bankrupt, and the capital of merchants is very small. Of course, they cannot promote the goods to foreign countries. Therefore, the goods imported into the country every year are several times larger than the exports. The government authorities also feel this situation, so they want to find ways to maintain it. For example, cotton yarn, the annual import of more than 72 million yuan, exports only more than 30 million, a difference of more than 42 million yuan. As a result, the cotton yarn industry cannot be maintained. The Ministry of Railways also thought of this situation and wanted to use railway transportation to help them and maintain them. Therefore, from this point, we can know the need for cooperation between the cotton yarn industry and the railway. The most important point of what I just said is the prerequisite for cooperation between agricultural, industrial, and commercial industries. The most important point is the cooperation of various industries. Then the various industries can develop, reduce costs, and increase the certainty of business. For example, (1) In terms of agriculture, we must first do our own production cooperation, credit cooperation, and agricultural product sales cooperation, (2) In terms of industry, we must also do raw material cooperation, power supply cooperation, and product sales cooperation, (3) In terms of commerce, we must also do purchase cooperation, sales cooperation, etc., and then cooperate with the railway, and we will naturally be able to find ways to reduce freight rates. As a result, the business will of course develop, so from these aspects, we know that there should be consumer cooperation in consumption and production cooperation in production. At the same time, we should cooperate with the railway in everything. Today, I will briefly talk to you. As for the benefits and methods of road-business cooperation, please ask Dr. Tan Peilin to purchase railway responsible intermodal transportation. For the benefits of the industrial and commercial circles, please ask Master Liu Fushu to speak.</p>
<h3>Liu Fushu's Speech</h3>
<p>The benefits of railway responsible intermodal transportation for agricultural, industrial, and commercial circles are that railway responsible intermodal transportation (1) can have safety guarantees for agricultural, industrial, and commercial circles, (2) customers do not need to send escorts, (3) save costs, such as loading and unloading fees, storage fees, care fees, etc., (4) save time, such as loading and unloading time, waiting time, shunting time, etc.</p>
<h3>Zheng Baozhao's Speech</h3>
<p>Regarding the improvement of the two railways, it is planned to (1) revise the freight rates, (2) intermodal transportation with national roads and waterways, (3) consider the export of agricultural products, (4) domestic intermodal transportation such as building wharves, warehouses, packaging, machinery, etc., and hope that merchants will not hesitate to teach, etc.</p>

<h3>Chinese Cotton Mill Association Holds Annual Meeting Yesterday to Re-elect Staff</h3>
<p>Rong Zongjing and Eleven Others Elected as Executive Committee Members. The Chinese Cotton Mill Association held its annual general meeting at the association's office on Edward Road yesterday afternoon. More than 40 factories attended and elected Nie Lusheng as chairman. After performing the ceremony, the chairman gave an opening speech, saying that Mr. Rong Zongjing was away from Shanghai on business and served as chairman on his behalf. The annual meeting last year could not be held due to the war. This year, it was slightly postponed due to the situation. Our industry has been difficult and increasingly profound in the past two years, so there was a decision to reduce work, which was implemented the day before the annual meeting. Today, we are meeting together, and I am very saddened. The difficulties of the cotton industry have not ended, but we rely on our unity and common struggle to overcome the difficulties of the times. Then discuss the proposals and elect the executive committee members. The elected members are Rong Zongjing, Nie Lusheng, Wang Qiyu, Huang Shoumin, Dong Zhongsheng, Li Shengbo, Guo Shun, Yan Qingxiang, Cai Jian San, Su Taiyu, Liu Bosen, 11 people. The meeting adjourned at 6 o'clock.</p>
<h3>Reply to the Opposition to Diverting the Yellow River into the Huai River</h3>
<p>Stating That Diverting the Yellow River into the Jialu River Has Not Yet Been Decided</p>
<p>The Construction Department of the Henan Provincial Government previously had a plan to divert the Yellow River into the Jialu River and the Shahe River into the Huai River and into the Yangtze River, which caused panic among the people in the counties along the Huai River in Anhui and Jiangsu provinces. The Huai River Promotion Associations in Anhui and Jiangsu provinces telegraphed their opposition. The Huai River Management Committee has reported the situation to the Henan Provincial Government for investigation and handling. Recently, the Ministry of Interior and the provincial governments of Anhui and Henan both sent replies to Shanghai, (1) To the Anhui Huai River Promotion Association, Pubofang, Lvbanshi Road, Shanghai, I have received your telegram. Diverting the Yellow River into the Huai River is extremely important to the water conservancy of the three provinces of Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu. This department has approved the telegram from the Anhui Provincial Government to the Ministry, and has requested the Henan Provincial Government to report the detailed situation of the handling to the Ministry as soon as possible, so as to plan the overall plan. Except for waiting for the reply to be reviewed, a special reply is given, same as the Ministry of Government Seal, (2) To the Anhui Huai River Promotion Association, Shanghai, I have received your telegram. The case of the Henan Provincial Government's plan to divert the Yellow River into the Huai River and into the Yangtze River was previously sent by Yuan Dahua and other Jin gentry, and the Executive Yuan Ministry of Interior was telegraphed to ask for a resolute presiding officer, and the Henan Provincial Authorities were telegraphed to cancel the original agreement, and the Jiangsu Provincial Government was telegraphed to the Henan Province on the joint telegram, please know, Anhui Provincial Government True Seal, (3) To whom it may concern, The case was entrusted by the chairman to your association and requested that the Construction Department be ordered to abolish the plan to divert the Yellow River into the Yangtze River, etc. In fact, this has been reported by the Construction Department according to the order of this government, because the Huiji River in this province is silted up recently, only the original river course is dredged to help discharge the accumulated water in Kaifeng City, and it is planned to use a two-foot diameter siphon to draw water from the Yellow River for irrigation. The pipe mouth is closed at any time, and the flow is very small. Previously, there was a proposal to divert the Yellow River into Jialu, but it has not been surveyed in detail. Even if it is necessary, we should consult with the relevant provinces downstream before making a decision. As for the claim that construction has begun in northern Henan, it is even more untrue. The various sections mentioned in the association's telegram are presumably misunderstandings caused by the lack of details in the report. The corresponding letter is for your information. Sincerely, to the Anhui Huaihe Promotion Association, Secretariat of the Henan Provincial Government, April 18th.</p>

<h3>Letter from Song Qingling</h3>
<p>To the gentlemen of the National Resistance and Self-Salvation Association,</p>
<p>In response to your letter of April 12 and hearing that you have sent representatives to visit, I regret that I was unable to meet with you due to illness. Regarding the search of the general headquarters of the National Resistance and Self-Salvation Association by the concession police and the arrest of speakers, the China League for Civil Rights has sent a letter to lawyer Shen Junru to take charge of the negotiations. Please contact lawyer Shen directly. As for the position of chairman of the Resistance and Self-Salvation Association, because the other work I am undertaking has already exhausted my time and energy, it is impossible for me to continue to occupy the position and neglect my duties. Therefore, I firmly resigned from the position of chairman of the Resistance and Self-Salvation Association in my previous letter. From now on, I will still follow behind you as a member and strive to resist foreign aggression. I have always been responsible for everything I do, and I do not make false modesty. Please do not try to persuade me further. I am fortunate. I respectfully reply and wish you peace.</p>
<p>Song Qingling</p>
<h3>Letter Urging Wu Mai to Stay</h3>
<p>Vice Chairman Lianghan,</p>
<p>Your letter was submitted to the Standing Committee for discussion. Everyone agreed that the matter was of great importance and should be resolved by the Board of Directors as it was created by the Standing Committee. Therefore, it was decided to convene a meeting of the entire Board of Directors on the 26th of this month for discussion. However, the opinion of the Standing Committee members is just as your letter says, the national crisis is urgent, and therefore our responsibility is also very heavy. The situation is dangerous, which is one of the factors for our association's struggle. The people's patriotic sentiment is strong, and the future of the nation still has great prospects, which is another factor for our association's struggle. Such undertakings are extremely difficult and cannot be achieved overnight. Since you have led this association, you have been diligent and hardworking, and you are respected by all members. Now is a critical time, and if you leave, it will only please the enemy. What do you say to this? Your patriotic and loving heart for the country and the association is deeply admired by your colleagues. To reach the broad path, one must cut through thorns. Now our association has many difficulties, so our efforts should also be strengthened urgently. Sincerity can move even metal and stone, and moreover, national affairs are not impossible to accomplish, which is what we firmly believe. If we let you retire in times of crisis, how will we show this to others? Therefore, the Standing Committee members hope that you will restrain your modesty and continue to take responsibility and work together to overcome difficulties. We earnestly present these words and hope you will understand and agree.</p>
<p>Mang Daling, Chairman of the Fifth Standing Committee Meeting of the National Resistance and Self-Salvation Association.</p>

<h3>Labor Dispute at Hua Shun Rubber Factory</h3>
<p>Factory Announces Temporary Shutdown</p>
<p>Workers Panic and Gather to Discuss Response</p>
<p>The Hua Shun Rubber Factory in Yaoqiaobang, Southwest Shanghai, recently announced a temporary shutdown, causing panic among the workers and leading to a serious labor dispute. The details are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Origin of the Labor Dispute</h3>
<p>The factory was founded by Ningbo native Qiu Xijiu as a sole proprietorship, with Cai Zengyu as the general manager. The business was generally prosperous, employing several hundred male and female workers. Recently, the factory announced a shutdown for several days starting on April 9 to sort out old goods. However, the factory has not announced a reopening date to this day. The workers, concerned about their livelihoods, became panicky and elected representatives Qiu Zemin, Sun Hongsheng, Ni Renyuan, Guan Quangen, Cai A Jin, Ye Jingui, etc., to contact Manager Cai Zengyu yesterday morning. They requested that the factory resume operations immediately to maintain their livelihoods and that wages be paid appropriately during the shutdown period. The factory manager refused, stating that the factory was suspending operations from that day due to sluggish business, and all workers would be dismissed, which provoked a public outcry and led to the labor dispute.</p>
<h3>Workers' Deliberations</h3>
<p>Since the workers' representatives failed to negotiate effectively, they convened all the factory workers to discuss countermeasures. The following items were decided on the spot: (1) Appoint Qiu Zemin, Sun Hongsheng, Ni Renyuan, Min Quangen, and Cai A Jin as representatives to be responsible for negotiations, (2) Petition the Party and government authorities to order the factory to resume operations immediately to maintain the workers' livelihood, (3) Demand payment of wages during the shutdown period, (4) Demand the return of year-end bonuses, (5) Workers must not be dismissed without reason, and it was decided to petition the Party and government authorities on the same day.</p>

<h3>Assassination on Shantou Road Yesterday Morning: Chen Yongsen Assassinated</h3>
<p>Eight Shots Fired, Died on the Spot</p>
<p>Entire Family in Extreme Grief</p>
<p>The assassination that occurred at the intersection of Yunnan Road and Shantou Road in the Public Concession at 12:50 AM yesterday was briefly reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that the deceased was a wealthy merchant, Chen Yongsen. The reason for his assassination is not yet clear. According to some observers, it may have been due to business matters. The police are currently searching for the murderer, and the truth will soon come out. The details of the events before and after the murder are supplemented below.</p>
<h3>Leaving the Theater Midway</h3>
<p>Chen had been doing business in Shanghai for decades and had founded many companies. At the same time, Chen personally checked all the income and expenses of the companies. Therefore, Chen came and went to various companies to handle store affairs every day, except for social engagements, and used his own car for transportation. At about 10 PM the night before, Chen took the car to Wenguizhai Candy Store next to Tianchan Stage on Fuzhou Road as usual to check the day's accounts. After about half an hour, Chen thought it was still early and suddenly had an urge to go sightseeing, so he told the driver to drive the car first.</p>
<h3>Large Quantity of Silver Shipped to America</h3>
<p>Approximately One Million Taels to Be Exported This Morning</p>
<p>Since the news that the United States had abandoned the gold standard and raised the price of silver was released, the price of gold in this port plummeted last Friday, by as much as eighty-six yuan. In the past, silver was only imported, but now it is suddenly being shipped from Shanghai to foreign countries, presumably because the United States has raised the price of silver. It is now known that more than 200 boxes of silver ingots, weighing about one million taels, were loaded onto the Changxing Company's Empress of Asia yesterday and will be exported to New York this morning. It is said that the silver was shipped by foreign banks in this port, such as the British and Dutch banks.</p>
<h3>Elementary School Teacher Drowns in the Huangpu River</h3>
<p>Jiang Weiying from Changzhou, a Pitiful End</p>
<p>At around 5 PM the day before yesterday, a middle-aged man boarded a ferry at the Hankou Road Customs Wharf to cross the Huangpu River. When the ferry reached the middle of the river, the man suddenly jumped into the river and tried to drown himself. His body sank and floated again. The old boatman Fan Jinlong used a bamboo pole to hook him and rescued him, and sent him to the Customs Water Police Station. He confessed that his name was Jiang Weiying, 28 years old, from Changzhou. He used to work as an elementary school teacher in his hometown, but now he is unemployed. Because he could not make a living, he came to Shanghai to look for old friends to find work and stayed in a cheap hotel. However, he did not find any for several days, and the money he brought was limited and had already been used up. He was now in a desperate situation and thought it would be better to die than to become a starving corpse. The police officers, seeing that he was very pitiful, ordered detectives to send him to the Changzhou Association to find a way to settle him down.</p>
<h3>The Odd Suicide of a Boiler Shop Owner</h3>
<p>No Need to Commit Suicide</p>
<p>Hanged Himself in the Bedroom</p>
<p>Advised His Children Before Death</p>
<p>Passed Away During Afternoon Nap</p>
<p>Wang Ruiyin, from Yancheng, 53 years old, ran a boiler shop at 2675 Haining Road. He had several children. He originally had a shop in Zhabei, but Wang suffered heavy losses since the Shanghai War last year and had almost no foothold in Shanghai. Recently, he repeatedly tried to find ways to borrow more than one hundred yuan from relatives and friends before setting up a boiler shop in the current place to maintain his remaining years of life. The day before yesterday, he did not know what kind of irritation he had received. At lunchtime, he gave his children some kind words of advice. After the meal, he said that he had to go to the bedroom for an afternoon nap. His sons and others thought that their father was old and might be weak, so they did not suspect anything else. Unexpectedly, the old man went to the room alone and hanged himself. Later, his eldest son, Shouming, wanted to visit his father because of something urgent, but the door was locked tightly. He knocked on the door and was not allowed in, so he knew there was something wrong and tried to open it. He saw that his father had hanged himself. He was shocked and grief-stricken at the time. When he untied him, he was dying, so he immediately reported to the Huisi Police Station in charge and ordered detectives to go to investigate. He was sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective, and he died soon after. The body was carried to the Forensic Examination Office on Feilun Road. Yesterday morning, Guo Wei, a prosecutor appointed by the First Special District Local Court, came to the office to examine the body. He sat on the case and interrogated Wang Shouming, the son of the deceased, who said he was 19 years old. He said that his father had not shown any unhappiness on weekdays. He only owed more than one hundred yuan to others, and no one asked him to collect it, so he did not know why he committed suicide this time. After Guo Jun obtained the confession, he announced that the deceased Wang Ruiyin had indeed hanged himself before his death. The body was handed over to his son Wang Ming to sign a guarantee to take it back for burial.</p>
<h3>Since You Loved It at the Beginning, Why Abandon It Midway?</h3>
<p>Returning, he then went to Tianchan Stage to watch a play. After being seated for about two hours, he found the plays boring and left the theater without waiting for the end of the show.</p>
<h3>Pulled Down and Shot Multiple Times</h3>
<p>After Chen left the theater, because the car had already returned, he walked a few steps to the corner of Yunnan Road and Shantou Road and hired a rickshaw to return home. However, after getting into the car, the rickshaw driver had not gone a few steps, and at the corner of the road, in front of the Yitaixiang Tobacco and Paper Store, three thugs wearing black robes suddenly chased to the side of the car, stopped the car, and pulled Chen out of the car without asking why and shot him three times in a row. Chen was seriously injured and ran back wildly. The thugs continued to chase him and shot him five times in the back, all hitting him. After this serious injury, Chen could no longer support himself and suddenly blood gushed out, and he fell to the road. The nearby pedestrians and shops were all frightened and fled one after another. The murderers also took the opportunity to escape in the noisy crowd.</p>
<h3>Detectives Go to Pick Up Cartridge Cases</h3>
<p>After the incident, the Lao Zha Police Station in charge received a report and immediately dispatched detectives to the scene. They saw that Chen had died, and blood was flowing like a river beside him. Upon further inspection of the surroundings, a cartridge case was found and taken back to the police station for filing. Meanwhile, detectives were dispatched to hunt down the murderer, and the body was transported to the Forensic Examination Office on Feilun Road to await examination by the court this morning. It was learned that Chen had a total of eight shots in his body, including two shots in the chest, one shot next to the right ear, and five shots in the back. His family did not know about it afterwards. It was not until the driver drove back to Wenguizhai to pick up the owner because he had not returned late at night that he got the news. He hurried home to report, and the family was in extreme grief.</p>
<h3>Chen's Family Asks for the Arrest of the Murderer</h3>
<p>Chen's name was Yongsen, from Chaozhou, Guangdong. He was 48 years old and lived at 5 Zhilan Lane, west of the Xiaocaichang in the French Concession. Chen was one of the shareholders of the Taohuagong Hotel. Other businesses solely operated by Chen included the Rongchang North and South Tobacco Exchange near the Great World, the Hongchang Yongda Candy Store on Fada Road, the Wenguizhai Candy and Fruit Store on Fuzhou Road, and the Jinyongxing Appliance Store. He had three sons: the eldest, Jiangbao, 18 years old, currently an apprentice at the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway in Zhejiang Province; the second, Sibao, 15 years old, currently studying at the middle school department of Daxia University on Zhongshan Road; and the youngest, Lanbao, 13 years old, currently studying at the Municipal Council Gezhi College on Guangdong Road. The family was able to make a decent living. Two days before the incident, Chen traveled to Suzhou with friends. However, because store affairs were waiting to be handled, he returned to Shanghai first. Unexpectedly, he suffered this disaster. The police are currently hunting down the fleeing murderer, and Chen's family is also asking for the arrest of the murderer in order to bring him to justice and comfort the wronged soul.</p>
<h3>Participating in the Chicago Exposition: Jade and Porcelain Lacquer Treasures Shipped to America</h3>
<p>To Be Loaded onto the Dollar Coolidge on the 29th</p>
<p>Zhou Guanhong and More Than Ten People Travel Together as Escorts</p>
<p>A portion of the products from our country participating in the Chicago Exposition has been scheduled to depart from Shanghai on the Dollar Liner on the 29th of this month. The supervisors will also travel to the United States on the same ship. The details are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Construction of the Pavilion</h3>
<p>The China Products Association for the Chicago Exposition first sent Cao Dehui and Zhang Xianglin to the United States to prepare for the construction of the special pavilion. It is said that the style is modeled after our country's palace, in order to show the ancient civilization of the East. The association has received a telegram from the American contractor and supervisor stating that the pavilion can be completed in one month.</p>
<h3>Selection of Products</h3>
<p>The products selected by the association from various provinces and cities to be transported to the United States for display are mostly the most precious jade artifacts, as well as porcelain from Jiangxi, lacquerware from Fujian, and valuable woodware from other provinces, etc. They are the essence of the country, competing in the exposition. There are many pieces, packed in more than 600 boxes, with a huge value.</p>
<h3>Merchant Ships Compete for Transportation</h3>
<p>When the various shipping companies on the Pacific route in Shanghai heard that a large number of exhibits were being transported to the United States, six shipping companies competed to solicit business from the association. Because the exhibits were precious, the association was very concerned about transportation and paid great attention to the selection of ships. Dollar Line, through Zuo Zhenbang Mr. Huang Junqian’s actions have allowed them to obtain this opportunity. Zuo Zhenbang and the association have finalized the shipping procedures.</p>
<h3>Departure Date</h3>
<p>The more than 600 boxes of exhibits are currently being sorted and packed and are scheduled to be transported to the United States on the first-class new liner President Coolidge of Dollar Line on the 29th of this month. When boarding the ship, the association and Dollar Line will each send special personnel to supervise and take care of the items, as they cannot be loaded and unloaded like ordinary cargo, for fear of damaging the jade and other items. Dollar Line has designated Zuo Zhenbang as the supervisor. When the cargo arrives in the United States, it will be transferred to a train to Chicago.</p>
<h3>Members Travel Together</h3>
<p>The China Products Association for the Chicago Exposition has designated more than ten people, including Zhou Guanhong, Shao Dehui, and Zhang Wendi, as escorts and members of the conference. They have already agreed with Dollar Line yesterday to reserve cabins on the President Coolidge and issue tickets. They will also travel to the United States with the exhibits on the 29th and take care of them along the way.</p>
<p>Huang Junqian Fell in Love with a Woman from His Hometown</p>
<p>Instigated Her to Divorce Her Husband and Live Together</p>
<p>Ten Years of Affection Suddenly Gone with the Wind</p>
<p>The Woman Was Unwilling and Officially Filed a Lawsuit</p>
<p>Fu Ruirong, the owner of the Lequn Hotel on Zhejiang Road and a native of Ningbo, fell in love with Shi Jinmei, a woman from his hometown, many years ago. At that time, the woman was only 28 years old. The woman's parents were unaware of this ambiguity, so they still married the woman to a man named Wang. Although the woman did not want to, she did not dare to resist. After being married to Wang, she and Fu were still in love, like glue and lacquer. However, they could only have secret affairs. Later, Fu decided to grow old with her, so he instigated the woman to divorce Wang. When the woman was 19 years old, she openly lived with Fu. After struggling in the love field for three years, she finally achieved her ultimate goal. Fu had not married, so he considered her his wife, and their relationship was very close. Until now, ten years have passed, and she has given birth to six children. When Shi came, she brought 8,000 yuan in cash and 28 taels of gold jewelry, which have been gradually used up over the years to adjust her husband's economy. Initially, she did not ask Fu for an IOU because they were a couple, but Fu, to comfort her, voluntarily commissioned a lawyer to draw up an IOU for her. The IOU stated (Since Fu Ruirong and Ms. Shi Jinmei came together, their relationship has been constant, and they have sworn to grow old together. Looking back, they had already agreed to marry each other, but after various obstacles, Ms. Shi Jinmei resolutely solved them and spent a lot of mental and financial resources to achieve today's satisfactory result. People are not made of wood or stone, so how can they not be grateful? Therefore, this IOU is made. If there is a change of heart midway, or there is an affair or abandonment, etc., willing to pay 10,000 yuan in alimony, and both parties will sever their relationship. Otherwise, they must still be responsible for cohabitation and support, lest there be no proof in the future. This IOU is made),</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the ink of the IOU was not yet dry, and their love broke down. Since July of the year before last, Fu abandoned her. The 250 yuan per month for household expenses was also cut off. She repeatedly asked relatives to discuss with Fu, asking him to consider their past relationship and maintain their relationship to the end. Fu turned a deaf ear to all of this. Negotiations have been going on for nearly two years with no progress. She recently hired lawyers Dai Ji'en and Yin Jingyi to submit a petition to the First Special District Local Court, requesting mediation and advising Fu Ruirong to repay 28 taels of gold and 8,000 yuan in cash, and pay 10,000 yuan in alimony, etc. The other day, the judge of the court's mediation office held a hearing for mediation, and both parties complied with the summons and appeared in court. First, Shi Jinmei stated the process of coming together with Fu and presented the IOU given by Fu, requesting that Fu be ordered to fulfill it. When asked of Fu Ruirong, he did not deny the IOU, but he refused to pay the money requested by Shi. Therefore, the mediation failed. She has now decided to proceed with a formal lawsuit through her lawyers.</p>

<h3>Reader's Advisor</h3>
<p>A Collection of Letters Discussing the Question "Can One Return to the Countryside?" (15) Mr. Zhu Tianqing of This City Writes in Response to Mr. Liu Simin's Questions</p>
<p>On the 17th, I saw Mr. Liu Simin's letter in the Reader's Advisor column. It was a long piece. At first, I thought Mr. Liu had some brilliant new ideas to share, so I took the time to read it carefully from beginning to end. Unexpectedly, after reading it, I felt immense disappointment. It turns out that Mr. Liu is just occupying space in the Reader's Advisor without offering any fresh perspectives on the question of "Can One Return to the Countryside?" He is merely questioning me and Mr. You. Since Mr. Liu has some questions for me, I must respond to his letter.</p>
<p>(1) The most important source of suffering for Chinese farmers is indeed their lack of knowledge. The reason they lack knowledge is clearly due to the underdevelopment of rural education. Mr. You's view is like this, and my view is similar to his. As for why rural education in China is so underdeveloped, the situation is, of course, very complex. Political instability, infighting among warlords, the widespread disturbances caused by the communists, the intrusion of foreign capitalist forces, and excessive taxes all frequently inflict great blows on the countryside, pushing farmers and rural areas into bankruptcy. Almost all poor farmers are too busy taking care of themselves to worry about rural education. This is the reason for the underdevelopment of rural education. Running education, especially rural education, is an unprofitable endeavor. Only those with vision and determination can do it. Although the Chinese countryside is bankrupt, it is the tenant farmers who suffer. The wealthy landlords still possess vast fortunes and enjoy themselves at home. In principle, these landlords could generously donate their wealth to support rural education. However, China is a country where individualism is highly developed. From officials to common people, everyone only knows how to seek profit. (If they don't exploit others, they are considered exceptionally good people). They are too busy taking care of themselves to worry about running rural education. Therefore, you see that although the countryside is bankrupt, some people still take their fortunes to prosperous cities to enjoy themselves. As for the wealthy households who have lived in the city for a long time, they are immersed in pleasure and have no desire to return home. Asking them to run rural education is as difficult as ascending to heaven. For example, how many people can be like the recent Mr. Ye Hongying, who single-handedly contributed a large sum of money to specifically run rural education in rural areas? Under these circumstances, how can we expect rural education in China to develop? After the countryside goes bankrupt, should people from the countryside run to the city? After the countryside goes bankrupt, can people from the city not return to the countryside? If, after the countryside goes bankrupt, people from the countryside can simply run to the city to find a living, then I can boldly say that not only will the city feel the danger of overpopulation, but the countryside will also deteriorate. Foreign capitalism will be able to take advantage of this situation. At that time, the countryside will inevitably be completely ruined, and the old feudal system will not survive either. As for the general people who go to the city to find a living, because the city feels the danger of overpopulation and the cost of living increases, they will inevitably wander in foreign lands. There is no doubt about that. Therefore, my argument is that no matter how bankrupt the countryside becomes, people from the countryside should not leave the countryside and go to the city. Because living in the countryside is ultimately much easier than in the city. As for people in the city, although the countryside is bankrupt, I think it is possible to return to the countryside because the cost of living is much lower than in the city! Let's talk about the city again, taking Shanghai as an example. Shanghai is a limited area, but the population is increasing day by day. As a result, there is a feeling of overpopulation. There are many talented people, but the accommodating institutions are limited. Therefore, supply exceeds demand, and unemployment increases day by day. If the unemployed remain in Shanghai, then waiting for a year or two... or even ten years, I am afraid they will never be able to find a foothold, and the unemployment problem will certainly not be resolved. Because the unemployment problem is difficult to solve, Mr. You Huai'gao and I advocate persuading Mr. Xiong Sheng to return to the countryside. Firstly,</p>
<h3>Lost and Found</h3>
<p>If there are any lost boys or girls, please pay attention. This is the Social Bureau.</p>
<p>Number 2028, female, He Changqing, from Jiangbei, 10 years old, January 7, 1933, sent by the Xinzha police station to the Chinese Relief Society for Women and Children.</p>
<p>Number 2029, female, Ruiying, from Funing, 14 years old, January 8, 1933, sent by the Huishi police station to the Chinese Relief Society for Women and Children.</p>
<p>Number 2030, female, Wang Linbao, from Jiading, 9 years old, January 8, 1933, sent by the Laoza police station to the Chinese Relief Society for Women and Children.</p>
<h3>Weather Report</h3>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday stated: Over the East China Sea, atmospheric pressure is stable. Sunny weather along the coast of the entire country, with calm winds or light breezes in uncertain directions. Northern Shandong will experience localized heavy fog and gentle southwest winds due to the expansion of low pressure over Mongolia. Furthermore, in the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in this city was 81.0 and the lowest was 52.5. On the same day last year, the highest was 67.1 and the lowest was 56.1.</p>
<p>it is easy to solve the problem of livelihood. Secondly, Mr. Xiong Sheng can devote his efforts to developing rural education. The reason why I advocate developing rural education is that I feel the current need for rural education in China. Whether China's democratic politics can achieve a perfect state in the future depends entirely on the level of knowledge of the people. In other words, whether education is developed, rural education certainly occupies the most important position. Although Xiong Sheng's ability is limited, he cannot rely on him alone to develop national rural education, but if Mr. Xiong Sheng does a good job of running rural education, then with Mr. Xiong Ting's model, I believe there will be people who follow in Xiong Sheng's footsteps. Because of Mr. Liu Simin's questions, I have combined the reasons for the underdevelopment of rural education with my suggestions, as stated above. (2) ("Mr. You's advice to people to go to the countryside is completely a backward idea of individualism. Not only is Mr. Zhu backward, but I say this so you don't get angry for now.") I feel that Mr. Liu is being too careless with these words. ("Mr. Zhu, I say this so you don't get angry for now.") Where does this anger come from? What is this saying? If Mr. Liu, you have good opinions to share, I should listen attentively. But unfortunately, you have not contributed any good opinions to the readers and me. At the same time, I find that you are flaunting your writing skills and deliberately provoking people (Mr. You's advice to people to go to the countryside is completely a backward idea of individualism. Mr. Liu, this is too arbitrary. May I ask what Mr. You's purpose is in advising people to go to the countryside? Is it to call people to go to the countryside to be comfortable? What is Mr. You's starting point for advising people to go to the countryside? If the starting point is not clarified, don't add criticism. I say you are ridiculous, you are really ridiculous. (National Crisis) (National Crisis) is shouted loudly. If you don't engage in practical work, what is the use? Mr. Liu, if you shout loudly, will the violent sun retreat because of it? (We are still at war. If there are people with a conscience, they should actively encourage anti-Japanese sentiment in the cities first, organize, and then push from the cities to the countryside, organizing people's anti-Japanese national salvation associations and national salvation groups. Teach the farmers to know that we can only take up arms to drive out the enemy who is invading our territory (imminent national crisis). Mr. Liu, did you say these words? Oh! Looking at the words, they are very grand. But can this method achieve satisfactory results? Ah! Mr. Liu, I think not. Let me tell you. The year before last, after the Shenyang Incident, the students at sea, college students, middle school students, elementary school students, male and female, were filled with enthusiasm. They shouted loudly to go to the countryside to publicize. They hoped to awaken the patriotism of the farmers, but what was the result? Wasn't it equal to zero? What is the reason for this? I think you have not seen through this point. Let me tell you, Mr. Liu! This is the reason for the underdevelopment of rural education. Because rural education is underdeveloped, the general farmers cannot understand the meaning of (everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the nation). Therefore, before rural education is developed, trying to rely on the power of propaganda (to teach the farmers to know that we can only take up arms to drive out the (imminent national crisis) is a thankless task. It is impossible to do. Therefore, wanting to (push from the city to the countryside) sounds very convenient, but how easy is it? Mr. You and I advised Mr. Xiong Sheng to go to the countryside. It is not to say that in the face of the imminent national crisis, we are advising Mr. Xiong Sheng to flee far away. We are advising Mr. Xiong Sheng to return to the countryside. In a passive sense, we are still teaching Mr. Xiong Sheng to save the country. Because the main purpose of our advising Mr. Xiong Sheng to return to the countryside is to teach him to develop rural education. And currently, only rural education in China can be saved. Although the effect of rural education is very slow, its effect is very great. I know that Mr. Liu absolutely does not advocate for Mr. Xiong Sheng to return to the countryside. Because Mr. Xiong Sheng can actively stir up anti-Japanese sentiment in the city. However, Mr. Xiong Sheng himself has not yet secured his livelihood. How can he save the country? Mr. Liu, I would like to ask you!</p>
<p>(3) The starting point for building a new-style Peach Blossom Spring is to develop rural education. Therefore, the purpose of developing rural education is to enable the people to understand national affairs as the highest goal.) These words are indeed what I said, but I myself feel that the meaning is very coherent. Because after rural education is developed, farmers can become literate. After becoming literate, they can read newspapers and magazines. After being able to read newspapers, they can naturally understand national affairs. At least they will not be completely ignorant. Why do you analyze the phrases into (building a new-style Peach Blossom Spring) (making the people aware of national affairs.) And say (building a new-style Peach Blossom Spring) is married to (making the people aware of national affairs). Hey! Mr. Liu, have you studied rhetoric? You can't even analyze phrases. We are a little ashamed for you. If rural education is not developed, can the people understand national affairs? I would like to ask Mr. Liu again.</p>

<h3>New Minister of Education Wang Shijie to Take Office</h3>
<p>Ministry of Education Completes Handover, Zhu Jiahua Cables Urging Transfer</p>
<p>Received Wang's Reply, School Affairs Briefly Arranged, Will Come to Beijing Immediately</p>
<p>Minister of Education Zhu Jiahua, since being transferred to the Minister of Transportation in early November last year, has been unable to hand over duties due to Weng Wenhao's refusal to take office. Although the Ministry of Transportation's affairs are complex, Zhu still bears responsibility for the Ministry of Education. For several months, Zhu repeatedly sent letters and telegrams during the era of Dean Song, urging Weng to come south to take over the duties. On one hand, he expressed to Song that it was extremely difficult to manage both positions. After Dean Wang returned to Beijing, Zhu immediately presented the issue of the Minister of Education to Wang, stating that it should be resolved quickly so that Zhu could hand over duties as soon as possible and avoid managing both positions. Now, the Central Political Council has approved Weng's resignation and appointed Wang Shijie as his successor. Zhu immediately telegraphed Wang, urging him to come quickly to take over the duties. At the same time, Zhu instructed the Ministry of Education to handle the handover, which is largely completed. It is reported that Wang Shijie telegraphed Zhu yesterday (the 22nd), promising to come to Beijing as soon as the arrangements for school affairs at Wuhan University are slightly settled.</p>
<h3>Tense Situation at Zhongshan University</h3>
<p>Students Given Five Days to Leave School</p>
<p>(Guangzhou, 23rd) The student unrest at Guangzhou's Zhongshan University, despite mediation by Cai Tingkai and others, remains serious. The students still demand the removal of Zou Lu and the cancellation of the expulsion of seven student leaders. This morning, the students held an open-air rally, and the situation was extremely tense. They also threw firecrackers at the school's office. The school authorities claimed that the student unrest was entirely instigated by troublemakers among the professors and was not the students' original intention.</p>
<p>(Hong Kong, 23rd) Guangzhou University students held a meeting late on the 22nd and decided to give Zou Lu five days to leave the school.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Rejects Original Text of Private Schools in Beijing Regarding the Entrance Examination</h3>
<p>Principals of private middle schools in Nanjing submitted a petition to the Ministry of Education to revise the entrance examination methods, which was sternly rejected. The original text of the petition and the original reply from the Ministry of Education are recorded below.</p>
<p>Original Petition with Names of Principals: The principals of various schools, including Xiong Chong, principal of Sanmin Middle School; Chou Lunjie, principal of Wuzhou Middle School; Tong Runzhi, principal of Zhonghua Girls' Middle School; Yao Cheng, principal of Anhui Middle School; Zhou Ji, principal of Caimei Middle School; Zhou Ruizhang, principal of Gaoqing YMCA Middle School; Lu Ziheng, principal of Dongfang Middle School; Zhang Fang, principal of Jinling Middle School; Bao Wennian, principal of Yuqun Middle School; Qiao Yifan, principal of Zhongnan Middle School; Yu Jiehou, principal of Zhongying Middle School; Liu Fenzi, principal of Huiwen Girls' Middle School; and Tong Boting, director of the Women's Law and Politics Training Institute.</p>
<p>Proposed Methods: The methods proposed by the principals included five items: 1. Referencing the example of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education allowing exemption from the junior high school entrance examination; 2. Referencing the example of the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education allowing schools to prepare preliminary exam questions and submit them for selection by the Social Bureau; 3. Exam subjects must be based on subjects shared by all schools in the city participating in the entrance examination; 4. Regular grades should account for two-thirds of the total score to comply with the Ministry's order to emphasize regular training; 5. The passing standard should be based on the score of the majority of students.</p>
<p>Ministry of Education's Reply: After receiving the petition, the Ministry of Education immediately issued a reply stating: (The petition has been received. It is found that graduating students from public and registered private senior and junior high schools under the jurisdiction of the educational departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities must uniformly participate in the graduation entrance examination. The examination questions for the graduation entrance examination should be prepared by the graduation entrance examination committee. This has been clearly stipulated by the Ministry in the Provisional Regulations for Graduation Entrance Examinations for Primary and Secondary School Students. The two sections mentioned in the petition, regarding the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education allowing exemption from the junior high school entrance examination and the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education allowing schools to prepare preliminary exam questions, are not factual. The subjects for the middle school entrance examination have also been listed in detail by the Ministry in the Provisional Regulations for Graduation Entrance Examinations based on the provisional standards for middle school curriculum. They are the teaching subjects shared by all public and private middle schools nationwide. The first, second, and third points requested should not be discussed. As for middle school students, although emphasis is placed on their regular grades in the school's graduation grades, the graduation examination grades are still highly valued. Article 64 and 65 of the middle school regulations stipulate that students with failing grades in three or more subjects or even with failing grades in two subjects, but any two of which are in Chinese, English, Mathematics, and Labor in junior high school, or any two of which are in Chinese, English, Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry in senior high school, shall be retained for one year. Students with a failing grade in one of these subjects or failing grades in two other subjects may take a supplementary examination. If they still fail, they should still be retained for one year. This is still consistent with the Provisional Regulations for Graduation Entrance Examinations for Primary and Secondary Schools, which stipulate that students must pass all subjects to graduate. As for the passing standard for the entrance examination, the education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities should formulate concrete and objective standards in the examination methods based on the scientific methods of literature. It would be a great loss to the original intent of the entrance examination to use the scores of the majority of students participating in the entrance examination as the passing standard. The fourth and fifth points requested are difficult to approve. Please be informed of this reply.)</p>

<h3>Representatives of the Peiping Municipal Education Association, Yu Shiyuan, Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Bearing Three Major Missions</p>
<p>Yu Shiyuan and Wu Ketie, representatives of the Peiping Municipal Education Association, arrived in Shanghai from Beijing at 8:00 AM yesterday and stayed at the Oriental Hotel. According to Yu Shiyuan's conversation with reporters, their mission is threefold: (1) As representatives of the Peiping Municipal Education Association, they are striving for the allocation of educational funds for Peiping from the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Finance. After arriving in Beijing on the 19th, they contacted the Central Party Headquarters, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Education, and the Ministry of Finance. Ye Chucang, Zhu Jiahua, Chu Minyi, and others personally received them and promised to do their best to urge the Ministry of Finance to allocate funds. Yesterday, the Ministry of Education replied, maintaining the original plan (that is, the central government will assist Peiping with 50,000 yuan per month for educational funds) and the 50,000 yuan for February will be allocated immediately by the Ministry of Finance. (2) To show the slide show of the Changcheng War to promote anti-Japanese sentiment. They held several screenings in Beijing, and Yu gave a speech. When the scene of Song Zheyuan's Dadao Team killing the enemy was shown, there was thunderous applause, and the audience was deeply moved. After arriving in Shanghai yesterday, they also plan to hold screenings so that the people in the rear can learn about the situation of the war on the front line and achieve the effect of uniting against Japan. There are many groups from the South who bring comfort goods to the front line to comfort the soldiers, but the comfort goods they bring are often not the most needed items on the front line. Sending them over thousands of miles is too uneconomical. According to Yu's detailed investigation on the front line and the letters from the various armies, the most urgently needed items are heavy-duty vehicles, Zeiss 6x binoculars, telescopes, compasses, raincoats, and waterproof shoes. It is hoped that various national salvation groups can donate more of these items in the future. In addition, there is a unified fundraising organization in Peiping called the Joint Association of All Sectors for Fundraising for National Salvation. It has raised millions to purchase heavy-duty vehicles and other items, which have been sent to the front line, and 400,000 to 500,000 yuan have been spent on air defense. Now, when Peiping and Tianjin are in danger, it is hoped that there will also be a unified fundraising organization in the rear to raise a large amount of funds for actively resisting Japan. It is heard that the municipal government of this city has already made this proposal, and good results are expected soon. (3) To exchange views on wartime education with the Education Association of this city and jointly initiate the establishment of a joint association of education associations of various provinces and cities nationwide.</p>

During the simulated war, one team attacked, and three teams defended, for a total of four simulated wars, with the four teams taking turns attacking and defending. The organization was strict, and the instructors served as consultants, providing on-site guidance, using fields as defense lines and earth mounds as natural barriers.

<h3>Luo Haiguang Opens the Scoring</h3>
<p>At the start of the first half, Central China took the initiative and launched two fierce attacks, but they were unsuccessful. East China followed suit and pressed the enemy camp fiercely. The forwards connected as one, and Central China could not resist, and Luo Haiguang of East China scored a goal, opening the scoring.</p>
<h3>Chen Guangyao Adds a Goal</h3>
<p>Because the defense of Central China's rear was unable to resist, and the area in front of the goal was constantly in danger, East China also had a corner kick opportunity. Chen Guangyao took the kick, and the ball fell in front of the goal. Chen Zhenhe greeted it with his head, but it was slightly off. Guangyao caught up and shot the ball, succeeding in one fell swoop, and East China won two goals.</p>
<h3>East China Scores Three Goals in a Row</h3>
<p>At this point in the battle, the situation became one-sided. Central China did not have time to defend, let alone attack. Therefore, in front of Central China's goal, the generals of East Wu were densely distributed, creating a situation of facing enemies on all sides. Afterwards, Luo Haiguang of East China scored two goals in a row, and Chen Guangyao scored another goal. The first half was thus settled with a score of 5-0.</p>
<h3>Central China Responds with One Goal</h3>
<p>After resting and fighting again, Central China was determined to counterattack, hoping to retaliate, and their momentum increased greatly compared to before. East China showed some negligence, and Cheng Yuehan of Central China scored a goal. However, Cheng was injured and left the field immediately, and Wang Yide replaced him.</p>
<h3>East China Scores Four More Goals</h3>
<p>East China's military was well-organized and launched a victorious attack, becoming even more awe-inspiring and causing the enemy to lose courage. However, Central China was not willing to show weakness and resisted fiercely, making the battle even more tense. Luo Haiguang of East China scored two more goals in a row, and Chen Guangyao and Chen Hongguang each scored a goal.</p>
<h3>Central China Scores Two More Goals</h3>
<p>After Central China conceded four goals in a row, they succumbed with a large difference of 1-9. The tide had already turned, and it was difficult to turn the situation around. However, each player worked hard and persevered to the end, and finally Du Dingjian scored a goal. Finally, East China was penalized with a penalty kick, and Huang Jiaoyan of Central China scored another goal. As a result, East China won 9-3, retaining the National Zonal Football Championship.

<h3>Record of East China's Victory over West China</h3>
<p>Result: 11-0</p>
<p>(Special dispatch from Hankou) The National Zonal Football Tournament, the final day on the 22nd, the highly renowned East China team played against the West China team. In the first half, the West team only defended and did not attack, and gradually even defense became impossible. East China thus won 3-0. In the second half, the West team's morale was depressed, and they conceded eight goals in a row to the East team. East China won again 8-0. In total, it was 11-0, and West China was惨败. The detailed record of the battle is as follows:</p>
<h3>East China Team</h3>
<p>Wan Xianghua, Li Ning, Liang Shutang, Chen Hongguang, Xu Heng, Chen Zhenhe, Luo Haiguang, Gu Shangqin, Chen Zhenxiang, Cao Qiuting, Chen Guangyao (upper), Zhong Yongseng (lower)</p>

<h3>Ten Thousand Spectators Thronged</h3>
<p>People in Wuhan had long heard of the reputation of Shanghai's football players and all wanted to see their superb skills. The weather was clear and sunny, and the spring breeze was gentle. Also, it was Saturday, so ten thousand spectators thronged to the venue. The area around the stadium and the stands were all full. Those who came later had no place to stand, so they climbed trees to watch. The green trees and willow branches became temporary stands. The enthusiasm of football fans in Wuhan can be seen from this, and it is also because East China's great reputation has been able to move them.</p>
<h3>West Team Defeated by Two Penalty Kicks</h3>
<p>At 2:10, the battle began. The generals of East Wu fought bravely and took the lead like a swift wind and torrential rain. As a result, not long after the battle began, the West team was penalized with three corner kicks and one handball. The defenders also used their hands instead of their feet twice near the goal, and were penalized with two penalty kicks. The first one was taken by Gu Shangqin, but the kick was slightly high and flew over the top of the goal. The second one was taken by Luo Haiguang. Luo was known as "Long-legged Immortal" and was strong and stable. The ball was like a sharp arrow, flying low and hitting the net from the right corner of the goal, thus opening the scoring, and the West team conceded a goal.</p>
<h3>Little Black Coal's Shot Missed</h3>
<p>After fighting for another ten minutes, the East team's forwards moved nimbly and passed the ball accurately, repeatedly pressing the West formation. The West team's defenders were still able to cope, but they were repeatedly penalized with corner kicks. Luo Haiguang, Chen Hongguang, and Chen Zhenhe in the East team often lurked near the goal, waiting for the corner kick to be taken, and then headed the ball straight into the goal, but none of them hit the target. Little Black Coal dribbled the ball extremely well, and his attacks seemed not yet fully energetic. Several times his shots were too high, and the spectators were all sorry.</p>

<h3>Long-legged Immortal Scores Twice</h3>
<p>After a stalemate for about twenty minutes, Cao Qiuting and Luo Haiguang advanced the ball from the left side, passing in short quick succession straight towards the West team's goal, and Luo scored again, thus scoring twice. Before long, Chen Hongguang went deep into the West formation alone and headed a ball into the net. At this point, the first half ended, and the first half ended with a score of 3-0. The number of free kicks taken by both sides: the West team was penalized with twelve corner kicks, two penalty kicks, and one foul; the East team was penalized with two handballs and one foul.</p>
<h3>Change of Sides in the Second Half</h3>
<p>In the second half, the two sides exchanged positions. The East China formation had slight changes. Zhong Yongseng joined the forwards, replacing Chen Guangyao, and he fought even more bravely. At this time, although the West team was still shouting and fighting hard, their morale had gradually been sapped, and the front and rear gradually lost contact. Not even five minutes had passed before Zhong Yongseng scored a goal. Afterwards, several shots at the goal were saved by the West team's defenders.</p>
<h3>Three Goals in Five Minutes</h3>
<p>After suffering repeated defeats, the West China team was gradually unable to support itself. East China fought even more fiercely, and within five minutes, Cao Qiuting, Luo Haiguang, and Zhong Yongseng each scored a goal. The West team was unable to resist, like a pile of firewood being destroyed. Soon, the West team regained their spirit and tried to attack, and Zhang Shuqiao attacked the East formation and scored a goal, but it was declared invalid for offside. The West team was unable to recover from this.</p>
<h3>Zhong Luo Wan and Others Were Extremely Brave</h3>
<p>At this time, the battle was about to end, and the West China team adopted a full defensive stance. The spectators thought that the East team would not be able to score easily from then on, but the East China players still had courage to spare. Zhong Yongseng and Luo Haiguang continued to score two goals, and Wan Xianghua scored two goals independently at the end, thus settling the second half with a score of 8-0. The number of free kicks taken by both sides: the Asian team was penalized with four corner kicks, and the East team was penalized with one corner kick and one handball.</p>
<h3>Comparison of the Two Sides</h3>
<p>After East China won against West China 11-0, they sang victory songs loudly, and the spectators also praised them. Looking at the entire battle, the East China team's skills were truly amazing. For example, Wan Xianghua and Zhong Yongseng, Luo Haiguang's ability to charge, Chen Zhenhe's skill in passing, Li Ning and Gu Shangqin's skill in parrying, and Xu Heng's skill in guarding the goal were all indescribably wonderful. It is true that their reputation is well-deserved. However, although the West China team suffered a惨败, many of their players also had their merits. For example, Tong Xianyu, Yun Chongqing, and Zhang Shuqiao were all able to fight to the end, and their attitude was calm. The defender Cao Guangzu was especially good at saving dangerous balls, and he saved seven dangerous balls, which ordinary people could not have prevented. Otherwise, the score would have been 18-0, and they would have been defeated even more thoroughly.</p>

<h3>The Philosophy of Shanghai People</h3>
<p>— Baihe</p>
<p>With the nation in such dire straits, even if one is a stubborn stone that sheds no tears, one cannot help but sigh for at least five minutes. But (state affairs are of no concern, don't trouble yourselves), the government already has a (complete plan) for national affairs, and for the common people to (grieve like losing parents) is simply superfluous. (When the sky falls, there are tall people to hold it up), so let me (in Shanghai, talk about Shanghai), talk about the local scenery of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Shanghai is truly a land of happiness. Shanghai prospers more each day.</p>
<p>America is a land of gold, but (recently), both large and small banks are guarded by iron generals. Only Shanghai's banks, in the past year, have without exception earned a (Mick-Mick). And (recently), several new banks have opened.</p>
<p>Countries around the world are in a slump, with (goods abandoned on the ground), and no one cares. But in Shanghai, it is the opposite. Large companies are packed (like sardines) every day. Especially during large sales, (like sardines) is not enough to describe the crowding, it's simply (hard to breathe). Even the (spiced peanut) stalls by the roadside are thriving.</p>
<p>Although Japan is the largest power in the East, its buildings are as small as chicken coops. How can they compare to our Shanghai mansions, seven stories, eight stories, seventeen stories, eighteen stories, as tall as observatories. It is said that a thirty-three-story mansion is currently being built in western Shanghai, and perhaps in the (near future), there will be even taller buildings.</p>
<p>The advertisements of venereal disease doctors at every alley entrance are often pasted an inch thick, which is enough to prove the development of (flesh) in Shanghai. According to economists, this kind of mysterious (flesh) transaction is closely related to commerce and finance. Recently, a (flesh exchange) has also opened in the humble alley where the author lives. Therefore, I know that Shanghai's prosperity is (flourishing) and (progressing without limits).</p>
<p>(The prosperity of Shanghai is the blessing of the people of Shanghai). This is the philosophy of the people of Shanghai.</p>
<h3>After the Fall of the Nation</h3>
<p>— Ajié</p>
<p>Our country's bureaucrats and wealthy people are used to being pampered and giving orders. They are also tired of beauties, cars, wine pools, and meat forests. They want to change their tastes and broaden their horizons, so they all hope for the country's swift demise, so that they can taste the flavor of being (a slave of a fallen nation) before they (kick the bucket)!</p>
<p>Mr. Xiong Xiling said: (The farmers in the north know how to love their country and send their own vehicles, cattle and horses to the front line. A small county XX can provide more than one million in cash to the soldiers at the front.) I think the people in the south are smarter than the northerners. Look at the people who are donating for love of the country now, they are all proletarians. Therefore, the reports in the newspaper cannot find a single donor of thousands or tens of thousands of dollars. Does this China belong entirely to these poor friends? Is it that the big officials have money and will not be (slaves of a fallen nation)? Maybe being (a slave of a fallen nation) has a special flavor, and it feels comforting! Originally, the Jews have money and don't need to worry about the troublesome matter of having or not having a country. Moreover, our country only knows how to exploit the rich and does not protect the rich. Once we become (slaves of a fallen nation), I heard that the municipal administration of the Eastern countries is very well run, with doors not closed at night and no one picking up lost items on the road. Our wealthy people don't need to be worried and carefully guarded against kidnapping at that time. And they can also save a bodyguard fee, it is also reassuring to be (a slave of a fallen nation)!</p>
<p>A wealthy man said: (Even if the Japanese annex China, the Chinese will only temporarily be slaves of a fallen nation. Look at the Jin, Yuan, and Qing dynasties, although they annexed China, they were assimilated by the Chinese after a short time; so we don't need to worry.) Because they forgot the (times) and (national character), they only saw the vertical Jin, Yuan, and Qing dynasties, and did not see the horizontal Korea and Taiwan, no wonder them!</p>
<p>A wealthy man said: (Being a slave of a fallen nation is better than communism.) Although being a slave of a fallen nation is also graded, Filipinos who are slaves of the United States are treated better than Indians who are slaves of the British; Indians who are slaves of the British are treated better than Koreans who are slaves of the Japanese. It is also because their wealthy people were born at the wrong time, they cannot be slaves of the United States, nor can they be slaves of the British. Being slaves of the Japanese is ultimately more decent than being (White Russians), and maybe they can still enjoy happiness!</p>
<p>However, when they are lying on the sofa reading the newspaper, knowing that the Japanese invaders are advancing day by day, their conscience may have some feelings. (The Three Massacres of Jiading), (The Ten Days of Yangzhou), are we (heaven's chosen ones)! Are wealthy officials and bureaucrats going to take turns in person? They can't help but feel their hearts jump. Therefore, I am not polite and want to persuade you all to wake up and see through things earlier!</p>
<h3>A Strange Real Event</h3>
<p>In Jiaming County, in the third district, at the Ji family residence in Fanjiabridge, there is Ji Mingxia, who is a farmer. Her family is well-off. She built a new house two years ago and lives with her second son. They have always lived in peace. Unexpectedly, last winter, a formless monster suddenly appeared, often destroying the objects in the room. At first, it only affected the bedroom, but later it affected the outside of the room. The objects that were disturbed included bowls, pots, tables, chairs, and rice and wheat. It especially liked to play with the water tank. If there was a little water in the tank, it would soon be filled with chaff, wheat, bricks, tiles, or filth. The mischief mostly happened during the day, and it didn't avoid people at all. It was silent when it got dark. Ji Mingxia's family was troubled by it. They burned paper ingots and paper silks to ask it to leave, but it didn't work. The second son couldn't bear the disturbance, so he hired a Taoist priest to catch the ghost. Not only was the ghost not caught, but the disturbance became even worse. At first, the second son's room was not bothered, but later it was also disturbed. Every night, no matter the time, there would always be loud noises to wake people up, or the objects in the room would be pushed down, or the quilt would be lifted, or people's hands and feet would be hit. Sometimes, the entire bed would be filled with water. According to the locals yesterday, the monster continues to harass them, and it has become even more severe. Such a strange thing is truly unheard of. I am recording it for research by all walks of life. (If you have an effective method of expulsion, please send a letter to Mr. Ji, No. 24 Sanma Road, to forward.)</p>
<p>Long Novel</p>
<h3>Fourth Company Commander of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Five: Brewing Tea and Spending the Long Night, Cherishing the Passing Year and Marking the End of the Year, Shouting High the Slogan of Resistance Against Tyranny</p>
<p>Mrs. Jiang said: Chinese New Year should have the proper atmosphere. It is rare that Commander Zhao helps us. After I celebrate the New Year, I plan to buy something. Old Man Zhao said: Never mind. Both of our families have few people. I am strong, and he cannot go home for the New Year. Tonight, I have something to ask of you. Please, mother and daughter, help us make dumplings. Tonight, we also bought some vegetables here, and we invite you to celebrate the New Year at my house. There is nothing special, just pickled cabbage and vermicelli, mutton, and we'll have a hot pot to warm up and have a lively time. After dinner, we won't play cards or roll dice. We'll brew a pot of good scented tea, eat assorted snacks, and chat around the stove. How about that to spend the year? Mrs. Jiang said: Oh? How can I bother the old man? Before Old Man Zhao could answer, Zhao Ziqiang walked out of the courtyard. Because he was wearing a military uniform, it was inconvenient to bow, so he cupped his fist to Mrs. Jiang and said: Old Madam, you don't need to be polite. If you are willing to grace us with your presence, it will be a great help. How should I put it? Because my old man has spent the New Year in the shop every year, and it was very lively with the people in the shop. This year, we moved to Haidian, and he is very lonely. Mrs. Jiang smiled and said: Commander, you don't need to say anything. I understand. You have things to do at the camp, just go. I will definitely keep him company tonight. Zhao Ziqiang said: I am not much of an official, and I don't know any official ranks. And my little Lin, let him accompany the old man too. If the eldest daughter is willing to go, there will be four people in total, and it will be much livelier to talk. Mrs. Jiang smiled and nodded and said: Okay! After dinner, I will definitely go. Zhao Ziqiang said: Please, don't be polite, just don't be polite. We don't have anything special at my house, just the mutton hot pot that my old man makes himself. If you don't go, it will be the same, and if you go, it will be the same. Why not have a lively time? Mrs. Jiang felt that the father and son were very kind and sincere. If she really didn't go, it would be too impolite. So she smiled and said: Then, my daughter and I will definitely come and bother you. To say something familiar, please don't bother the old man himself. My daughter and I will come over later to help the old man. Zhao Ziqiang cupped his fist again and said: Then I am very grateful. It is getting dark, and I have to rush back to the camp. After speaking, he hurried out. (50)</p>
<h3>Investigation</h3>
<p>— Shiyan Ye</p>
<p>There are investigations that are temporarily assigned, and investigations that are permanently established. Temporarily assigned investigations are to investigate the rights and wrongs, the black and white, and the truth of a matter. Permanently established investigations are to supervise a certain cause and promote its upward development. Therefore, the former is passive and the latter is active. Today's investigations, whether passive or active, cannot escape the scope of the three lectures of power, profit, and face. Tang Tao will be investigated by the government, and he will be granted the title of military commander; the chairman kills people, and there is no follow-up after the monitoring censor investigates; after Lord Lytton comes east to investigate, the matter is over. Once the county magistrate and bureau chief are investigated, they will be dismissed, punished, or put in a wooden cage. People say that some investigations are unclear, and some reveal the truth. I say that these people have not read the investigation scriptures. The first lecture of the investigation scriptures on power has this important sentence: (If the investigator has more power than the investigated, then the rewards and punishments will be clear after the investigation. If the investigator only has an empty shell and no real power to be feared by the investigated, then black should be reversed to white, punishment should be rewarded, or there is no need for a follow-up after the investigation.) If this is clear, then there will naturally be no doubts. A friend said that his friend is in a certain department and is responsible for investigating various counties. None of the county magistrates he investigated were bad, and his monthly salary was nominally 140 yuan, so in reality it exceeded several times. An inspector visits a school, asks how many teachers and students there are, and walks around the entire school, and then considers the matter over. The second lecture of the investigation scriptures on profit also clearly stipulates that: (If the investigated person shows filial piety to the investigator, then black should be reversed to white. It also says: (The investigator's duty is to investigate, and being able to investigate is fulfilling his responsibility. Why ask about good and bad.) If you can do this, then self-interest can be obtained, the rice bowl can be protected, and profit is in it. When someone familiar is investigated, the matter is often handled perfunctorily, or he is praised whether he is investigated or not. The third lecture of the investigation scriptures on face says: (If the investigator has a relationship with the investigated, he should not be impartial and selfless, and should retain human feelings and abandon public affairs for private gain.) The investigation scriptures say so, so how can you not be perfunctory?</p>
<p>If you read the investigation scriptures once, you will not be suspicious and angry about today's investigation.</p>
<p>Gratitude: "Remaining Notes on Paintings Exposed" is a fine print of the Jvzhen edition of the Zhonghua Book Company, recording the calligraphy and paintings of famous people collected by the Qin family of Liangxi, as well as Mr. Qin Yiting's various painting inscriptions. It was once popular after publication. It will soon be reprinted, and a collotype-printed "One Painting Survives" is also available, which is a selection of twelve landscape paintings exquisitely painted by Qin Shengjie of Liangxi, with an essay on "A Simple Explanation of Learning Landscape Painting," which can indeed be a ladder for learning Chinese landscape painting. Yesterday, I received one copy of each from Fengjun, and I express my gratitude together. The above two books are sold on consignment at the Yiyuan Treasure Appreciation Society on Sanma Road and the Literature and Art Department of the Lili Company on Sijing Road in this city.</p>
<p>Women's Paradise</p>
<h3>Winding Ball Home Affairs Small Guide</h3>
<p>— Ju Yun</p>
<p>Sisters who often do woolen yarn work at home often have to ask someone to hold the yarn for them so that they can wind it into balls of woolen yarn. But sometimes they can't find someone to help, and they use the back of a chair to replace the job of holding the yarn. However, they still feel that it is not very suitable. If you have two new-style irons at home, or even electric irons, you can take them and place them in a suitable place to hold the yarn for you, so you don't have to ask anyone else, and it is very labor-saving. (The iron has a handle.)</p>
<p>Embroidery Tracing</p>
<p>Tracing embroidery patterns is really troublesome. People who are good at painting can naturally draw a picture according to the pattern paper. However, most people use carbon paper to trace patterns, but carbon paper often stains a good piece of material, and the pattern paper cannot be used again after two or three times. Now I have thought of a simple method. You can nail the pattern paper to the glass window, and then cover it with plain silk or plain satin. Facing the sunlight or lamplight, carefully trace the perspective pattern. Isn't it labor-saving? However, black and dark-colored silk and satin are not suitable, and patterned silk and satin cannot be traced clearly.</p>
<p>Hot Handle</p>
<p>Using copper kettles, iron pots, especially nickel-plated things, after being burned by the hot fire, they become so hot that you can't get close to them. If there is a rag nearby, you will naturally think of using a rag to take it. But sometimes it burns too much, and you don't have time to choose, and you often burn your hands. This is a common thing in every household. Everyone thinks that burning their hands is not a big deal, but it is still painful and troublesome. If you can tie the handle of the pot with old cloth when you buy it, and then wrap it tightly with thread, then there will be no more accidents.</p>
<p>Remove Oil Stains</p>
<p>If oil stains are dyed on any kind of material, just use cotton paper dipped in borax powder and quickly wipe off the oil stains with your hands. Then, no matter what kind of oil stains and no matter what kind of thing, it will have a miraculous effect.</p>
<p>Brushing Gloves</p>
<p>I often see people washing gloves. It seems that they are washed clean everywhere, but the fingers are always not washed clean, which is indeed a pity. If you wear gloves on your hands when you brush them, then there is no need to worry about the shortcomings on your fingers.</p>
<p>Nails on the Wall</p>
<p>Using nails to nail on the wall often causes the gray powder wall to be unable to be nailed in. When it is nailed in, it is too loose and can be pulled out easily, and it can't hang anything at all. If there is a nail hole in the east and a nail hole in the west on the wall, it seems a bit unsightly. So, if the nail hole is too loose, you can use thick paper (such as kraft paper) and slightly soak it in water to plug it into the nail hole, and then nail it from the paper hole, which can be firm.</p>
<p>Small Salt Shaker</p>
<p>To put some things from a big bag into a small bottle, it will definitely spill all over the ground and all over the table. For example, if we have a big bag of salt and want to fill a small salt shaker on the dining room table, it seems a bit difficult, right? If you use an envelope and put some salt in the envelope, punch a small hole in one corner of the envelope, and pour it into the small bottle from the small hole, then it will definitely not spill outside again.</p>
<p>New Use of Blotting Paper</p>
<p>Everyone knows that blotting paper is used on writing desks to absorb undried handwriting. If you have a tray, whether it is a wooden tea tray or a metal tea tray, cut two pieces of blotting paper according to the size of the tray and put them on the bottom of the tray. Then, no matter if you are serving tea or water, whether it is to the guest room or the sick room, the tray and the cups will never make any noise again. At the same time, if some tea or water spills from the cup, the blotting paper can immediately absorb it cleanly.</p>

<h3>Overview of Medicine in Shanghai in the Past Ten Years (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Pang Jingzhou</p>
<p>Chapter 4: Business Situation (B) Narcotics used by compounders in the new drug industry are prohibited from import by national decree. However, buyers buy and sellers sell. How much is the actual supply of legitimate medicinal narcotics? There is still no regulation to this day. Therefore, regular pharmacies often fail to meet the demand because they strictly abide by the law. Irregular drug dealers can abuse the sale of these drugs as a sideline. The same situation is the import of syringes. Although it is stipulated that doctors must sign the order, the goods on the market can flow into the hands of any quack doctor. Where did they come from? This is another deformed situation in health laws and the pharmaceutical industry. Compounders cannot purely specialize in the compounding business. There are only about 20 Chinese-owned businesses in Shanghai. These 20 or so are commonly known as large pharmacies. As a rule, they also operate their own brand of ready-made medicines, sell cosmetics and perfumes, and also do wholesale business in raw materials and equipment. Otherwise, they would not be able to cover their expenses. In addition, there is another type of ready-made medicine merchant, such as those who specialize in a certain ready-made medicine and create a store name. There are also nearly ten of them in the city, but they have little relationship with the real medical community. (Such as Yong'an Tang Tiger Brand products are all household medicines) There are many foreign-owned pharmacies in the city, especially small-scale Russian pharmacies. They have greatly increased in the past ten years. I roughly estimate that there are more than 40 pharmacies of various countries in Shanghai. They can operate formally. Among them, several foreign drug dealers have obtained pharmacist licenses from our country's Ministry of Health and hang them up high. However, they just want to attract prescriptions from Chinese doctors.</p>
<p>In addition, there are foreign pharmaceutical factories. Some are represented by foreign firms, and some have their own branches in Shanghai, specializing in the sale of raw materials, ready-made medicines, injections, equipment, etc. However, they are completely different from compounding and manufacturing medicines. They are only of a sales nature. As a rule, their medicines should be wholesaled to pharmacies or hospitals and should not be sold directly to the public. However, they publish a lot of advertisements, send runners everywhere, and try their best to sell to various doctors and quack doctors. There is even a tendency to sell directly to residents. This is not to mention. The most inappropriate thing is that they have published many publications mixed with medicine, such as (Syphilis Treatment), (XX Medical Report), (XX Pharmaceutical Report), etc., which are specially for doctors who have a smattering of knowledge and people who use new medicines. In order to achieve the purpose of selling their drugs, they do not wait for legitimate needs. The contents of those publications, the terms are not uniform, and the theories are even biased. They have not been agreed upon by our Chinese medical community. Therefore, general quack doctors take them as textbooks. After reading them, they use medicine to find diseases, instead of seeking medicine because of diseases. Therefore, the newspaper publishes advertisements for cheap injections, such as (Altico per injection ○ yuan). (German Lion Brand 606 per injection ○ yuan). (French 914 per injection ○ yuan). It seems to call the patients to determine what disease they have and what medicine they should use, and then call them to get an injection. The creation of this strange phenomenon is not without the poison of some pharmaceutical factories' sales policies. Moreover, there are many pharmaceutical factories in various countries. The registered names of the same chemical products cannot be duplicated, resulting in a proliferation of drug names. Therefore, the new drug catalogs that can be checked in the general compilation of various pharmacies have as many as tens of thousands of drug names. (I personally have received more than 1,700 drug names sold by various pharmaceutical factories). Among them, there are many famous, effective, and necessary for treating diseases, but it is inevitable that absurd and worthless ones will enter. There are also those who change their appearance and compete with lower prices, which really messes up the drug market.</p>
<h3>How to Maintain Physical Health (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Jiang Junsun</p>
<p>How can you maintain the health of your body? This question has been studied by many, many people since ancient times. Qin Shihuang, Cao Cao and others' pursuit of the art of immortality is also the meaning of these. Among us human beings, there are really no people who are truly healthy and disease-free. However, people must first be healthy in order to have a sound mind and be able to work hard for their own careers. Then health is a more important issue than anything else, so how can we not study it and pay attention to it? We Chinese people really have not studied it and have not paid attention to it. It is like the owner of a car. When he has a car, he only knows how to use it and does not know how to protect it. If a small nail is loose, he does not know how to fix it until a big problem occurs, and even his life is lost. This is such a pity! According to the population mortality rate for last year, 1932, published by the Shanghai Public Concession Engineering Bureau the day before yesterday, only 12.8 out of every 1,000 foreigners died. For us Chinese people, 17.8 out of every 1,000 people died. Comparing the two types of people, five more people die out of every 1,000 Chinese people. The Chinese population living in Shanghai is estimated to be about 3 million. Based on this calculation, 15,000 more Chinese people died last year. The value of each person is at least 500 yuan, so Shanghai lost 7.5 million yuan more last year. The sanitary conditions in Shanghai are relatively good compared to the mainland, and the fact is still the same. I don't know how many people in China died unjustly due to poor health. The people are the foundation of the country. The unsoundness of our Chinese society, politics, and everything else is the result of the unhealthy bodies of our people. Physical health is not only beneficial to individuals, but also the only way to strengthen the country and the race.</p>
<p>Now I will tell a story to illustrate the close relationship between health and modern economics. Between North and South America, there is the Panama Canal, which everyone knows is the only man-made waterway connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Its economic importance is very great. It was first opened up by the French twice, which cost a lot of money. They all failed because the workers who opened the canal were unhealthy. In nine years, about 20,000 people died from malaria alone, and I don't know how many were sick. It was not until 1904 that the Americans took over. First, they paid attention to the health protection of the workers and eliminated the source of malaria. In a few years, the canal was opened and the great project was completed. Since then, it has had a great impact on transportation, culture, and economy, and it has also added a glorious page to the history of medicine.</p>
<p>However, the more developed material civilization is, and the more convenient world transportation is, the more the enemies of people's health and disease increase. Tuberculosis is still rampant and terrible. According to statistics from the United States, 170,000 people die from heart disease every year, 465 people die every day, and diabetes is also increasing year by year. The number of incurable cancers is now several times more. Millions of people are killed by malaria. With the development of industry, human life is shorter. Therefore, modern medicine has also changed. The doctor's job has also shifted from treating diseases to focusing on preventive medicine for health.</p>
<p>Preventive medicine researches and implements how to prevent people from getting sick. His work has public and personal distinctions. Public is public health. It pays attention to tap water, houses, streets, factories, hospitals, etc., cleaning and disinfection work. The things done by the Shanghai Municipal Council Health Department and the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau are this kind of work. Now, please pay attention to the fact that one-tenth of the money paid by the residents living in the Shanghai Public Concession is used for this work. Personal hygiene, down-to-earth prevention is to teach people practical methods to pay attention to health. Now, due to time constraints, I can only say a general idea. His implementation methods can be divided into three sections: (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Advice for Those Suffering from Venereal Diseases (Syphilis) (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>After I published an article in this journal discussing the establishment of a free syphilis hospital, I unexpectedly received several letters. In addition to hoping that this matter could be realized, the majority asked me to recommend a truly qualified venereal disease specialist to treat their suffering and avoid repeated mistakes. I am very ashamed because although I have been practicing in Shanghai for four or five years, I am naturally not accustomed to socializing and know very few people. I am not very familiar with which of my colleagues are truly specialized in this field. Even when I hear others mention someone as a "chief of a certain hospital," whether their knowledge and practice are completely consistent (i.e., the ethics of a physician) is highly questionable. Therefore, I feel very hesitant about these letters and unable to help. However, although I dare not recommend doctors, I have some understanding of the widespread situation of quack doctors deceiving patients. As a result of this chaotic and upside-down situation, I don't know how many patients are swindled each year. I will now write down what I remember to provide patients with some guidance and choices when seeking medical treatment, which I hope will be of some small help. (1) The scope of venereal diseases includes syphilis, gonorrhea, and chancroid. Each of these three diseases has its own specific symptoms and treatment methods, which cannot be confused. Unfortunately, when patients contract a venereal disease, whether it is syphilis, gonorrhea, soft chancre, or hard chancre, they always hope that the doctor will immediately inject them with Salvarsan (914), as if anything less would be insufficient. When they encounter a doctor who is not "in tune" with this mindset, the doctor will certainly want to explain the facts clearly. However, many patients still do not understand and even suspect that the doctor has ulterior motives. Of course, some patients may suffer from two diseases simultaneously, which is often seen in reality. Moreover, once a person has syphilis, it cannot be said that they cannot contract gonorrhea. However, both sides must have corresponding symptoms. It cannot be said that Salvarsan can treat gonorrhea. I have seen many such examples in my personal practice within a year, and I believe other doctors have had the same experience. Patients certainly would not invent such views themselves but must have seen other doctors treating in this way or heard such claims from other patients. In such cases, the loss of money is a small matter, but the confusion of right and wrong and the prolongation of the illness are dire consequences. Therefore, I want to emphasize that, in the words of patients: gonorrhea is gonorrhea, syphilis is syphilis, and the two treatments cannot be mixed. This correct understanding is of no small importance to the patients themselves. (2) When patients experience pain, most hope to be treated by a specialist. They feel that since they are called specialists, they must have seen more of these types of diseases than others and have more experience. This view is inherently correct. However, this principle cannot be applied to venereal diseases. I feel that at least 70-80% of the "specialists" in this field are not worthy of the name. Some doctors want to develop their business by using this title because venereal diseases are particularly common. However, this does not necessarily lead to adverse consequences. The majority do so because internal medicine, surgery, and other departments are difficult to imitate without any foundation. Only venereal diseases are relatively easier, with fewer categories and only a few fixed effective treatments. Incorrect treatments also have fewer adverse effects. Even if they mess things up, most patients suffering from this disease are "embarrassed" and do not often cause trouble. Therefore, people who fail to master other skills often see this as a shortcut to success. Almost every street or alleyway has a few venereal disease specialists to "decorate" the scene. As a result, the general public believes that we new doctors have no other skills besides treating venereal diseases, and even say that we have no other methods besides injecting Salvarsan. This is entirely due to their instigation.</p>
<p>Although the above is true, I do not believe that there are no true experts in Shanghai. However, the number of imposters is the highest, and patients must be extra careful. However, if patients find an expert for treatment, I also have a few words to explain to the patients. First, although experts have advantages over other doctors, they cannot be compared to old doctors with secret formulas passed down through generations. Their treatment of syphilis is naturally within the scope of arsenic, mercury, iodine, and bismuth preparations. The same applies to other diseases. Therefore, patients should not expect something other than Salvarsan injections or another "19220" that others do not know. This view is completely wrong. Second, when experts diagnose diseases, it does not mean that they can immediately know what the disease is in areas that others find difficult to diagnose. Conversely, if others have already provided irrefutable proof of the disease through serum or microscopic analysis, experts will certainly not say that they have another opinion. If a doctor has several facts but is unwilling to make a diagnosis without sufficient evidence, this attitude is very proper. Chinese people like everything to be miraculous. I hope patients will abandon these two ideas to avoid being deceived by fake experts.</p>
<p>(3) When patients have a disease, in addition to hoping for a reliable doctor, the second hope is of course that their disease will get better sooner! There is no one who does not think this way. Especially in our country, where the economy is backward and people's livelihoods are extremely difficult, except for a few wealthy individuals, almost everyone has to calculate the cost of medical treatment. In this situation, they think a very good opportunity has arrived. Claims such as "one injection is effective," "two injections eradicate the root," "gonorrhea stops immediately," "swellings disappear within a week," and other dazzling promotional methods are too numerous to mention. If they really had such achievements, I would dare to represent the patients in offering my deep gratitude. Unfortunately, we are still far from scientific medical facts! Even if we take a step back, even without such extraordinary achievements, as long as they follow the proper treatment path step by step, even if their reputation does not match reality, it will not harm the patients themselves. But is that really the case? I heard from a familiar patient that a doctor checks the patient's blood to see if they have syphilis with a very simple procedure that the patient can see immediately. I was baffled when I heard this. Later, I asked a classmate and learned that they add some sodium bicarbonate to the patient's blood in a test tube, burn it with fire, and tell the patient that the boiling and rising of the blood is proof of toxicity. We know that the Wassermann reaction is currently the most accurate method for checking for syphilis. This procedure and equipment are not simple, and very few ordinary doctors' clinics can handle it. Such a simple and quick method can be considered a great spectacle of absurdity! This situation is probably not false. From this example, we can imagine that their treatment methods must also be numerous.</p>

<h3>The Science of Healthy Birth (14)</h3>
<p>— Yu Songyun</p>
<p>(4) Umbilical Cord Cutting Method. When cutting the umbilical cord, strict disinfection and complete hemostasis are essential. The key is to make the umbilical cord dry quickly. A few minutes after the fetus is delivered, wait until the umbilical artery and umbilical vein no longer pulsate and stop, approximately three to five minutes after delivery, before cutting.</p>
<p>Why wait for the umbilical cord pulsation to stop before ligation? Because the blood in the umbilical cord and placenta is transported to the fetus, the fetal blood volume can be increased by 60 to 100 grams.</p>
<p>If the fetus is in a state of suspended animation, rapid resuscitation surgery must be performed. In that case, there is no need to wait for the umbilical cord pulsation to stop, and it is necessary to cut the umbilical cord quickly.</p>
<p>When cutting the umbilical cord, tie a knot about two or three finger widths away from the umbilical ring (or umbilical root), and then tie a second knot away from the first. Cut the umbilical cord between these two knots.</p>
<p>The purpose of the first knot is to prevent fetal bleeding. If the umbilical cord has too much Wharton's jelly, add another knot near the umbilical ring to ensure safety.</p>
<p>The purpose of the second knot is to prevent bleeding from the placental side of the umbilical cord. If it is not ligated, it will not only soil the bedding but also cause placental separation, leading to adverse effects. In the case of twins, if the blood vessels of the two fetuses in the placenta are connected, the second fetus may die from blood loss.</p>
<p>Commonly used ligation threads are hemp thread, cotton thread, silk thread, or silk. The scissors for cutting the umbilical cord should have slightly rounded and curved tips to prevent damage to the mother and child's bodies. Both of these items and the umbilical bandage must be strictly disinfected. Otherwise, umbilical cord viral infections are extremely dangerous. The double knotting method after cutting the umbilical cord involves making a second knot near the umbilical ring after completing the first knot, then looping the thread of the first knot once. Wipe the cut surface of the umbilical cord and its surroundings with alcohol, and then tie it tightly with a sterile bandage to achieve complete hemostasis and disinfection.</p>
<p>The umbilical cord must be kept dry, and the surrounding area should be sprinkled with a bactericidal astringent powder, such as (Dermatol) or boric acid powder, to facilitate early drying. Be careful not to let urine wet it. It will usually fall off in three to five days. After the umbilical cord falls off, continue to sprinkle powder and tie it with sterile gauze. Do not use old-fashioned plasters, which can cause corrosion.</p>
<p>(E) Postpartum Management</p>
<p>(1) Postpartum Pain. After the fetus is delivered, it is the third stage of labor. During this period, the most important points to pay attention to are uterine contractions and the amount of bleeding. If both are normal, then a natural process is best.</p>
<p>Shortly after the fetus is delivered, the so-called postpartum pain begins. After 15 to 30 minutes, the placenta detaches from the uterine wall. After about an hour and a half, the placenta leaves the uterine cavity to reach the cervix and vaginal fornix, and then the placenta is delivered, which is the proper course. If there are no special changes (i.e., signs of uterine atony, bleeding, etc.), do not easily resort to surgery except for appropriate treatment by a physician, otherwise it will be detrimental to the parturient.</p>
<h3>Common Knowledge of Diseases (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>Q: Are there changes in the respiratory system? A: Yes. Tonsillitis, bronchitis, or pneumonia caused by aspiration. Rapid breathing, resulting in a characteristic pattern of short and long breaths. Q: What is the entire course of this disease?</p>
<p>A: By the second week after the onset, it may take an unfortunate turn. Even if it is fortunately cured, it will leave hearing and vision impairments, mental disorders, muscle rigidity, paralysis, chronic edema, etc. Q: What is the target when diagnosing cerebrospinal meningitis? A: Sudden onset, severe headache, cerebral symptoms, neck stiffness, Kernig's sign, hypersensitivity, and changes in cerebrospinal fluid. The most reliable method is to demonstrate the causative bacteria in the cerebrospinal fluid. Q: What is the prognosis of cerebrospinal meningitis? A: Poor prognosis, with a mortality rate of 40 to 70 percent. Q: How can it be prevented? A: Isolate the patient. Use antiseptic mouthwash and nasal wash. Wear a mask when going out during epidemics. How is it treated? A: Avoid all external stimuli. The sickroom should be dark. Apply ice packs or ice pillows to the head and spine, or use cupping on the top of the head and mustard plaster. Take internal medication. Also, pay attention to bowel movements, urination, or perform lumbar puncture to reduce fluid pressure. In addition, injecting meningococcal serum into the spinal cavity in the early stages (after puncturing and draining 10 to 20 cubic centimeters of spinal fluid) is sometimes effective.</p>
<p>(6) Pertussis (Whooping Cough)</p>
<p>Q: What is pertussis? A: Pertussis is a paroxysmal cough, a contagious respiratory disease that is persistent and lasts a long time, hence the name "hundred-day cough."</p>
<p>Q: Does pertussis have other names? A: Yes, it is also called "tianxiao qiang" and "qiang qiang." Q: What is the Western name for this disease? A: The Latin name is PERTUSSIS, the German name is KOUCHHUSTEN, and the common English name is WHOOPINGCOUGH. Q: Where is the site of the lesion? A: It mainly affects the mucous membrane of the respiratory tract, causing characteristic spasmodic coughing. Q: Is there a relationship between age and gender in pertussis patients? A: Yes. It is most common in young children, and rarely affects adults. It is more common in girls than in boys. Q: What is the causative agent of this disease? A: A pertussis bacillus has been found, but at the same time, many other bacteria are often found in the patient's sputum.</p>
<p>Q: How long is the incubation period after infection before the disease develops? A: The incubation period is about one week before the disease develops. Q: How many stages are there in the course of the disease? A: There are three stages: the catarrhal stage, the paroxysmal stage, and the convalescent stage.</p>
<p>Q: What are the symptoms of the catarrhal stage? A: It usually begins suddenly with nasal catarrh, cough, redness of the pharyngeal mucosa, loss of appetite, and a decline in energy. Auscultation reveals bronchial murmurs. This stage lasts about seven to ten days. Q: What are the symptoms of the paroxysmal stage? A: The cough becomes more intense and paroxysmal during this stage. During the attack, a whooping sound is produced due to spasms of the vocal cords, followed by prolonged coughing after repeated deep inhalations, producing a characteristic echo. It is often accompanied by cyanosis of the face, distension of the jugular veins, tearing, and sometimes mucosal bleeding, swelling of the eyelids, and small ulcers under the tongue. Vomiting is also common. There may also be unintentional passage of urine and feces. In severe attacks, there may be suffocation. Attacks occur dozens of times a day, especially at night. Coughing continues until thick mucus is expectorated, which brings the attack to an end. After the attack stops, the whole body is tired, but soon recovers. This paroxysmal stage lasts for several weeks or even months, gradually reducing the severity and frequency of the attacks, and then transitions to the convalescent stage. Q: What are the symptoms of the convalescent stage? A: Although the attacks disappear during this stage, the hypersensitivity of the bronchial mucosa persists for a long time. The cough becomes an ordinary catarrhal cough. However, there may be recurrent paroxysms. Q: What are the complications during the course of pertussis? A: There are cases of combined bronchopneumonia leading to severe symptoms; and cases of diarrhea leading to malnutrition. In addition, there are complications such as measles, diphtheria, and pulmonary emphysema. Tuberculosis may also develop after the illness. Q: Is the prognosis of pertussis good or bad? A: The prognosis is generally good for children who are originally healthy. However, it is very dangerous for weak children or those with complications of pneumonia. Q: How is this disease prevented? A: Healthy children should not be in close contact with patients. The patient's sputum must be disinfected with antiseptic solution. In addition, the preventive injection of pertussis mixed bacteria plasma is definitely effective. Q: What is the dietary regimen for patients? A: Provide nourishing and rich foods (avoiding irritating foods). Live in a dry and clean air environment with plenty of sunshine. In the absence of complications, it is okay to walk around outside the house. Moving to the mountains or seaside for a temporary stay is very beneficial. Q: What is the best medication to use? A: During the catarrhal stage, use expectorants and warm drinks. During the paroxysmal stage, you can use some antipyretic and sedative drugs such as quinine, euquinine, antipyrine, potassium bromide, chloroform, etc. Inject pertussis sensitized bacteria plasma in injections, divided into four or five times, every two or three days. Or instill ether into the rectum, which is effective.</p>
<h3>Several Important Discoveries and Inventions in the Development of Modern Medicine (4)</h3>
<p>— Gu Shoubai</p>
<p>The movement of these red blood cells actually revealed the principle of blood circulation. In addition, Mr. Liu also discovered many facts with the power of his lenses. For example, the structures of the skin, teeth, and other parts of the body, as well as the subtle structures of plants and lower animals, are also extremely important. Although he could indeed see objects that others could not see through his lenses, people of his time did not necessarily believe the records of the objects he discovered. Although he only used his simple lenses and not compound microscopes, there is no doubt that he was the first person to contribute to the work of microscopy.</p>
<p>As for the inventor of the compound microscope, it seems to be Mr. Zansz, a Dutch spectacle maker in 1590. His microscope was very simple in structure, consisting of only two convex lenses. The one on top is called the eyepiece; the one at the bottom is called the objective lens. However, there were many shortcomings. The image was not clear, and there were many colors mixed in. Later, some of these shortcomings were removed by Mr. Dollond, and some by Mr. Tuloy, and most noteworthy was the improvement work of Mr. Lister's father (J. J. Lister), the inventor of the preservation method. He actually completed the compound microscope, and made the greatest contribution to improving the achromatic objective lens. Since 1800 to the present, the structural improvement of the microscope has almost reached the extreme of progress. In 1830, Lister (Joseph Jackson Lister) invented the achromatic lens. In 1823, Chevalier invented the compound objective lens. Later, there were also the inventions of Abbe's apochromatic lens, oil immersion device, and adjustable objective lens, so the effect of the microscope became more complete. I think there is no doubt that it will be improved and progressed in the future.</p>
<p>The invention and improvement of the compound microscope have had a great impact on the development of various aspects of medicine. Now let's list some of the most important ones. Histology was originally microscopic anatomy, which is the study of the microscopic tissues of the human body. Liu Wenhe had already discovered red blood cells in human blood and fat globules in milk in 1673, and cross-striations in muscles in 1679. Soon after, he discovered the structure of the crystalline lens in the eyeball, and in 1668 he discovered the circulation of blood in capillaries, as mentioned above. Marclleo Malpighi in the 16th century also used a microscope to observe the state of blood circulation in the lungs and mesentery of frogs; this had a great influence on Harvey's theory of blood circulation. In 1687, Mr. Ma also used a microscope to observe the development of chicken eggs, and even saw the initial state. In 1672, Graaf discovered the ovarian follicle. In 1677, Hamen discovered sperm. These microscopic observations are closely related to the development of embryology. In pathology, in the middle of the 18th century, Rokitansky of Vienna (Wien) used a microscope to study pathology, founded microscopic pathology, which is the basis of pathological histology, and opened a new era in the progress of pathology. Later, Rudolf Virchow of Berlin (Berlin), when he was at the University of Berlin in 1844, paid great attention to the embryology that was popular at the time and the cell theory of Schleiden and Schwann. As a result of his research using a microscope, he founded cellular pathology in 1858, overturning the liquid pathology theory, solid pathology theory, nerve pathology theory, and vitality theory of the past, and insisted that the phenomenon, location, and nature of the disease are all in the cell, believing that the nature of general pathology is nothing more than pathological physiology, and the root principle of the establishment of life phenomena lies in the cell. He regarded the human body as a cell state, and each cell as a citizen. At that time, as a result of the very developed research on pathological tissues, cancer cells, tuberculosis cells, leprosy cells and other specific cells were discovered, and it was believed that these were pathogenic, so his view was that the disease was a revolution caused by the existence of these pathogenic cells in the cell state, and it was a state of agitation of various citizens.</p>
<p>The development of cell morphology, which constitutes the basis of biology, is also closely related to the invention of the microscope. In the middle of the 17th century, many scholars had already discovered plant cells under a microscope. Later, some people discovered the nucleus and nucleolus. At the beginning of the 18th century, Hugo von Mohl named the content of plant cells protoplasm.</p>
<p>In 1839, Theodor Schwaou used a microscope to study the commonality of the structure and occurrence of animals and plants. As a result, he knew that the organs of animals are also developed from cells, just like plants.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier. As a result of microscopic research, it is recognized that: in biology, whether animal or plant, whether simple or complex in structure, the cell is the morphological and functional unit. The discovery of this fact soon expanded to embryology and pathology.</p>
<p>The newly invented microscope in the 17th century reached a perfect position in the 19th century, with the invention and improvement of achromatic lenses, oil immersion devices, light collecting devices and other accessories. At the same time, with the invention of staining methods and microtomes, the research in anatomy progressed from the aspect of the naked eye to the aspect of the microscope, and expanded to two new aspects. In detail, it is: in terms of morphology, it becomes histology, and in terms of occurrence, it becomes embryology. At the same time, due to the progress of cytology, research on diseases also pays attention to the cell tissue aspect, so the so-called cellular pathology is established; research on pathogens also pays attention to single-celled microorganisms, so the so-called microbiology is established.</p>
<p>Since the establishment of Virchow's cellular pathology, the diagnosis and treatment of tumors in surgery have been further improved. How could this be achieved without a microscope?</p>
<p>In addition, the invention of the microscope is closely related to the development of microbiology, infectious disease studies, and parasitology, as detailed below.</p>
<p>As for the modern disease diagnosis method, it is impossible without a microscope. For example, examining sputum with a microscope can show whether there are tuberculosis bacteria, lung fluke eggs, or elastic fibers; examining blood can calculate the number of red blood cells and white blood cells, the types of white blood cells, and whether there are spirochetes or malaria sporozoites and other microorganisms: examining urine can not only find various bacteria or filamentous worms, but also see various substances in the urine sediment; examining feces can find various parasite eggs or various microorganisms; without a microscope, how can these disease materials be examined? This microscopic examination, like chemical or serological examinations, is an indispensable task for new doctors in the diagnosis of diseases, so the microscope is really one of the powerful tools of new medicine.</p>

<h3>(Return to the Countryside!)</h3>
<p>— Xuan</p>
<p>The city is developed, and the idyllic countryside has changed its face. Therefore, there are pastoral poets who suffer from nostalgia; this slogan is (Go to the countryside!)</p>
<p>In the 1880s of the previous century, Russian intellectuals were blocked in the city because of the revolutionary movement, so they also had to change the direction of the revolutionary movement; the slogan was (Go to the people!) The so-called (people) also refers to the countryside.</p>
<p>We have also heard our intellectuals call out these two different voices of (Go to the countryside) for a while. But recently we have heard the third kind of call of (Return to the countryside); this is seen in the subtitles at the end of the film (City Night), and then in the (Discussion of Returning to the Countryside) in the Reader Consultant column of Shen Bao, and then in the conclusion of the business report of the Bank of China in the 21st year of the Republic of China (The Transfer of Financial Policy in the 22nd Year), which advocates (Those who have concentrated their investment vision on treaty ports in the past, now know that the prosperity of the national economy cannot be enhanced without the health of the interior. It is appropriate to seek safe ways to concentrate the funds and return them to the interior.)</p>
<p>(City Night) is to advise those poor people who have abandoned the countryside and squeezed into the city to (Return to the countryside to build a paradise in the countryside;). The Shanghai bankers advocate to (Return to the countryside) those funds concentrated in the city to restore the health of the interior; and those who advocate positively in the (Discussion of Returning to the Countryside) want people to bring money to develop the countryside. Among the three, the banker is naturally the most brilliant. Because what the countryside lacks is not people, but funds.</p>
<p>However, (Recently, the households in the interior who plant mulberry trees cannot raise silkworms. When asked why, they say: They cannot get one yuan to buy silkworm seeds.) The Bank of China report also described the poverty of the countryside in this way. That is to say, farmers not only have no savings of one yuan, but even cannot borrow a debt of one yuan, because he has already pawned everything. Therefore, unless the Shanghai banker is willing to (Distribute and return to the interior) the funds in the form of overdraft, otherwise, the farmer will still not be able to get one yuan to buy silkworm seeds! Originally, the funds returned to the countryside, (It is appropriate to seek a safe way.) Unfortunately, the Bank of China report does not clearly tell us where this (Safe way) is!</p>
<h3>(Return to the Countryside) and (Eat Meat Paste)</h3>
<p>— Yang Xingzhi</p>
<p>Not long ago, I saw a domestic film called (City Night). I remember the last scene was a group of men, women, old and young who were unemployed and unable to live in the city. They walked happily and vigorously towards the countryside. Someone asked them (Where are you going?) The answer was very simple: (Return to the countryside!) Return to the countryside? At that time, I was very anxious for them, and I wanted to ask them again, but then I realized that this was just (Acting), and this group of (Fake) coolies did not really want to return to the countryside, so I did not pull them back like the silly woodcutter who killed Qin Hui on the stage with an axe.</p>
<p>In the past few days, there has been a heated debate in the Reader Consultant column of this newspaper about the issue of (Return to the Countryside). The reason for this debate is that several (Foreign friends) of (Chinese nationality) sitting on comfortable sofas and looking at the other side of the Pacific Ocean have been persuading unemployed youths who cannot live in the city to (Return to the countryside). They even made a clever work plan for him, advising him to use ten years of hard work to build an imagined (Paradise). So this debate began!</p>
<p>In fact, those who advise unemployed youths to return to the countryside have no mistakes in their ideological system. The only mistake is that they should not just sit comfortably on the sofa, should not just look far at the other side of the Pacific Ocean, should not just watch Xuan Gong Yan Shi, or grass skirt exotic dances, etc., but should not slightly read Chinese newspapers full of the collapse of the countryside. In the past, haven't we heard the story of an emperor? The story is that in a year of great famine, the people had nothing to eat, and our silly emperor was surprised to ask his ministers: (The people have nothing to eat, why don't they eat meat paste?) In fact, how can this emperor be really silly? The silly thing is that he only knows how to be an emperor! Isn't a person's thought actually dominated and determined by a certain fixed economic background?</p>
<p>In fact, those who advise unemployed youths to return to the countryside simply do not understand that in the capitalist economic system, the countryside is only an appendage of the city, and the farmers who leave the fields are exactly the reserve army of labor in the city. At the same time, he does not know where the unemployed people in the city come from? And he does not know the extent to which the current Chinese countryside has declined? And how did this phenomenon of decline occur? Or it can be said that he simply does not understand the connection between politics and economy, so he just closes his eyes and shouts blindly: (How is the United States), (How is the United Kingdom), (Therefore we can do it too), with such clever logic, he will naturally produce clever (Paradise) in his mind, and naturally advise people to return to the countryside. It is a pity that they advise people to go to (Paradise) to enjoy happiness, but they themselves have never planned to leave the dusty city.</p>
<p>Why don't urban unemployed people return to the countryside? Why don't they eat meat paste in famine years? This is called (No coincidence), this is called (Double Absolute)!</p>
<p>Editor's note: Recently, the call of (Go to the countryside) has risen one after another, and it is quite lively. This journal received Mr. Xuan's and Mr. Yang's works on the same day. Although the meanings are roughly the same, there are still places where they can supplement each other, so they are all published.</p>
<h3>Way Out</h3>
<p>— Wu Guanzhong</p>
<p>When Wen heard Uncle Qing say that there was a vacancy in Xi Jun's bank and asked him to go to Xi Jun's house in the afternoon to contact him, his heart jumped with joy, but he tried to appear calm and asked: (What is that position?)</p>
<p>(What A Xi introduced will not be wrong!) Uncle Qing opened his eyes and said loudly. (It's copying, probably twenty-three yuan a month!)</p>
<p>(If Wen'er has a job, he can help lighten the family burden.) Mother said with gratitude and joy. She personally handed the water pipe to Uncle Qing. It really made her grateful that she had such a friend who was willing to take care of her son after her husband had died for many years.</p>
<p>Wen had been idle at home for two years since graduating from middle school. Today was the first time he had heard such a hopeful message. He was really a little fluttery, happy and at a loss.</p>
<p>At lunch, his mother specially bought some side dishes to treat Uncle Qing, and the three of them had a happy and full meal. After the meal, his mother immediately took out a new dress for him to wear, and sent them out the door with a happy face, and turned around and went in after watching them get into the rickshaw.</p>
<p>This was the severe cold of December. Wen was thinking in the car about how to speak beautifully when he met Xi Jun, and how to act generously. His heart was really both surprised and happy. The stinging cold wind blew on his face, and he did not feel cold.</p>
<p>Xi Jun was an important employee of the X bank and an old friend of the boss, Mr. Chen. When Wen and Uncle Qing came to his house, he was lying on a gorgeous copper bed smoking opium. Opposite him sat a modern girl, said to be the mistress he had recently married.</p>
<p>After drinking tea and saying a few polite words, Xi Jun said to Wen: (There is a job in the bank. Originally, the second class Huang Jun wanted to introduce it to his friend, but when he heard that I had someone, he let me have it. This position is very promising, and there is a possibility of being promoted to manager in the future! And the job is also very convenient. Just go to the bank a little earlier every morning to clean the boss's writing room, and pour tea and pull smoke when guests come),·····</p>
<p>Wen felt as uncomfortable as being cut by a knife when he heard these words. This is a servant! How embarrassing! How would his friends know if he did such a thing? His many hopes for the past half day suddenly vanished, and he felt suffocated and depressed.</p>
<p>(If you are willing to do it, I will see the boss with you tomorrow, how about it?) (Let me go home and ask my mother!) Wen refused. (No need to ask, how do you feel yourself?) Uncle Qing stared at him with both eyes. (Me?······I don't want to do it!) He made up his mind. He would rather starve to death than be a servant.</p>
<p>(It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter! I will introduce you to a good opportunity again!) Xi Jun fell back on the bed and smoked. After a while, he spewed out a puff of smoke and said: (Oh, Lao Chen is really shrewd, he knows that middle school graduates will not do this kind of job. He said, who can learn from him? He graduated from XX University, but he worked as a servant in front of foreigners for two years when he first came out!)</p>
<p>This was clearly teaching him a lesson, no, it was simply insulting him. He stood up and said to Uncle Qing, who had come with him: (I'm afraid my mother is waiting, I have to go first.) But, what would he take back to comfort his hopeful mother?</p>
<h3>Ramblings from Qu Lu</h3>
<p>— Zi Zhan</p>
<p>(21) Official Document Format Recently, Tao Sheng Zhou Kan discussed the university president's regulation that students should write letters in a fixed format, which is to show off his posture and play officialdom. His saying is purposeful and cannot be said to be unreasonable. However, I think if it is to show off dignity, then the person who stipulates the format is wrong; if it is for the convenience of handling affairs, then stipulating the format is right. Because the format is fixed, write according to the format, which is easy for the writer to write and easy for the reader to read. It is convenient for preservation and facilitates examination, and neatness and beauty are secondary. Wen Xin Diao Long Shu Ji Pian says, (Before the Warring States period, monarchs and ministers wrote together. The Qin and Han dynasties established rituals, and there were memorials.) It means that the division between private letters and official documents began in the Qin and Han dynasties. Historical evidence shows that after Qin Shihuang annexed the six kingdoms, he thought that the world was divided into counties and laws were unified. There has never been such a thing since ancient times, and the five constant virtues were not enough. The name was not changed, and it was not enough to claim success and pass it on to future generations. Therefore, he called himself emperor, and the emperor called himself Zhen, changed the name of the people to Qianshou, and ordered it to be called Zhi and Ling to be called Zhao. The official document had a statutory format since then. It can be seen that the official document format was originally determined by the dictator and the people to show off their authority. History said that during the time of Emperor Shihuang, all affairs in the world, no matter how big or small, were decided by the emperor. The emperor even measured the books by stone weight, and there were presentations day and night. Those who did not meet the presentations were not allowed to rest. Therefore, the stipulation of the official document format at that time also gave a lot of convenience to the rule of the dictator and the people. The meaning of the official document format does not go beyond these two. The university is an academic institution, and the stipulation that students should write letters in a fixed format is probably to take the one meaning of convenience in handling affairs?</p>
<h3>Carrot Top</h3>
<p>— Written by Jules Renard, Translated by Lin Qu</p>
<p>Bambusa Partridge</p>
<p>As usual, Lepic poured everything in his hunting bag on the table. This time, what came out of the bag was two bambusa partridges. The eldest brother Felix wrote them down on a slate on the wall. This was his job. Each child had his job. The elder sister Elestine was responsible for skinning or plucking hair. As for Carrot Top, he was specialized in ending the lives of those injured prey. Because everyone said he was hard-hearted, he obtained this privilege. The two bambusa partridges were wagging and turning their necks. (What are you waiting for if you don't kill them?) said Lepic's family. (Mom, I'm also happy to take turns to write them down on the slate.) said Carrot Top. (The slate is hung too high, you can't write.) said Lepic's family. (Then I'm also happy to pluck their hair.) said Carrot Top. (This is not something a man should do.) replied Lepic's family. So Carrot Top picked up the two bambusa partridges. Everyone earnestly pointed out some methods to him: (Grasp them tightly in this place, you understand, grasp the neck tightly, and grasp the hair upside down.) One in each hand, behind his back, he began. (Kill two at once, beast!) said Lepic. (This way it can be done faster.) Carrot Top replied. (Don't be a mother-in-law; just have fun yourself.) said Lepic's family. The bambusa partridges struggled, their bodies twitching, and their wings flapping, scattering hair all over the ground. They never wanted to die. He would probably kill a child more easily than killing these two bambusa partridges. He clamped them between his two knees, his face turning red and white, covered in sweat. He raised his head, unwilling to see anything, and grasped them tighter in his hands. The bambusa partridges resisted stubbornly. He hated to end them quickly, he grabbed their claws and slammed their heads hard on the tips of his leather shoes. (Ah! This executioner! This executioner!) shouted the eldest brother Felix and the elder sister Elestine together. (He did it really well,) said Lepic's family. (The poor beasts, it's really bad luck to fall into his hands.) Lepic, although a veteran hunter, also ran away disgusted. (Okay!) said Carrot Top, throwing the two dead bambusa partridges on the table. Lepic's family turned them over and looked at them. Blood and a little brain flowed from the broken skull. (We should have snatched them from his hands earlier,) said Lepic's family, (Isn't this terribly dirty?) said the eldest brother Felix: (He didn't do it as well as he did a few times before this time.)</p>

<h3>Railway Transportation and Rural Economy (Part 2) Zheng Baozhao</h3>
<p>C. Promoting Domestic Sales of Agricultural Products. The decline of domestic agricultural products is due, firstly, to the decline of exports and, secondly, to the oppression of foreign goods, as mentioned earlier. In addition, the narrowness of the domestic market, the weakness of the market, and the outdated sales methods are also important reasons for the decline of agricultural products and the bankruptcy of rural areas. If the domestic market is broad and the market is large, even if there is foreign goods intrusion, or even if there is no large amount of exports, it will not hinder the development of agricultural products, if any, it will not be as drastic as it is today. This is another way to promote domestic sales to save rural areas. There are only two ways to promote sales: one is the innovation of sales methods, and the other is the improvement of transportation methods. The former cannot be done by the railway alone, but it can also lead and promote it. The latter is the responsibility of the railway itself, and it should be implemented urgently. Now, please discuss them separately as follows: (1) Realizing Cooperation in Sales and Transportation. When our farmers sell their products, they mostly rely on intermediaries to buy and sell them. The exploitation they suffer at one time is small, but the permanent deception they suffer is even greater. Farmers have no knowledge, no organization, and do not know where the goods are going or where the market is, let alone open up sales channels and open up new markets. The railway has the responsibility to assist and improve the rural areas along the line. It should use its leading position to contact farmers in various places along the line and organize sales and transportation cooperation agencies to replace the old-fashioned intermediaries and seek to open up the agricultural product market. The benefits of cooperation are numerous. To cite the most important ones: (1) The exploitation of intermediaries is eliminated, and all profits go to the members; (2) Market surveys can be conducted in various places at any time, adjusting surpluses and deficits, and sales are not limited to one corner; (3) Understanding the changes in market needs and being able to adapt at any time; (4) When production is excessive and sales are sluggish, loans can be obtained to purchase and stabilize prices. This is from the perspective of sales. As for transportation, since the railway guides its organization, convenience, and economy, it is even more difficult to express. Since the products of the members are all sold to the cooperative, accumulating small amounts into large amounts and turning scattered loads into whole cars, the savings in freight must be considerable. The unavoidable consumption in the past is now eliminated in one fell swoop, and its benefit to the income of farmers is not shallow. Therefore, in addition to sales cooperation, there are also the benefits of transportation cooperation, which is indeed an important plan to expand the sales of agricultural products.</p>
<p>(2) Establishing Refrigerated and Heated Transportation. Fresh agricultural products, such as melons, fruits, vegetables, etc., are easily rotten in summer and easily frozen in winter. Without special equipment, they often cannot be transported far. Western railways mostly have refrigerated and heated transportation services, using ice in summer and fire in winter to ensure the integrity of fresh goods. Therefore, their fresh fruits, vegetables, fish, meat, eggs, and other items can be transported to various places, and the sales are very broad. Although our country's railways are equipped with a small number of ice trucks, they have not been used for refrigeration. As for the heating business, it is also lacking, so the sales of various fresh goods are often limited to one corner, so-called production is here, and consumption is here. It is rare to be able to use the railway to transport to two or three hundred kilometers away, which is like heaven and earth compared to foreign countries' ability to transport fresh goods for thousands of kilometers. Therefore, if you don't want to promote the sales of fresh goods, then forget it; otherwise, the equipment and business of refrigeration and heating are indispensable. Moreover, the refrigeration business is not limited to the protection during transportation. Developed countries often build refrigerated warehouses at the terminal stations of the railway for the purpose of stocking goods, either run by the railway itself or rented to the outside world. After the fresh goods are transported to the arrival station, they may not be sold and consumed completely. With these two types of refrigeration equipment and business inside and outside the station, fresh goods can be transported far and stored for a long time, expanding sales and avoiding price reductions, which will benefit the revitalization of agricultural products without the need for further explanation.</p>
<p>(3) Developing Sales of Fresh Goods in the Suburbs. Vegetables, fruits, poultry eggs, milk, fish, and other products produced in rural areas are all necessary for urban residents and are indispensable every day. Our country's cities have always relied on the shoulders and hands of villagers to meet their daily needs. The quantity of buying and selling is small, and the production area is also small, often resulting in excessively high prices and reduced consumption. This is nothing else; it is the harm of the old-fashioned sales and transportation methods. The Japanese railways have special low parcel freight rates for food products produced in the suburbs (milk, fresh meat, fresh fish, shrimp, vegetables, fruits, poultry eggs, etc.). Therefore, food products can be transported by passenger cars, and the cost is lower than ordinary parcels. Our country's railway parcel freight rates do not have this special treatment, which seems to be of considerable value to imitate. If the transportation is fast, the freight is low, and the procedures are simple, then the products from a little farther away can also enter the market continuously, and the supply area will not be limited by the distance of the villagers' shoulders, which is beneficial to the rural economy and also beneficial to the lives of citizens.</p>
<h3>D. Promoting the Integration of Transportation</h3>
<p>The above-mentioned encouragement of exports, protection of domestic products, and promotion of sales all depend on the efforts of the railway itself, but also on the connection of various transportation systems and the mutual assistance of various transportation methods. Otherwise, the methods are good, but the organization is still not sound. For example, although railway freight rates are already low, agricultural products are far in the interior, or the railway cannot reach them, and there are still many expenses for transshipment. Also, although railway transportation equipment has been improved, other water and land transportation methods are still the same, and the benefits obtained will be greatly reduced. If the intermodal transport policy is determined and the intermodal transport method is implemented, so that various water and land transport policies become a whole unified organization, advancing and retreating together, and coexisting in prosperity, then all the methods of encouragement, protection, and promotion can be implemented without hindrance. This integration of transportation should be led by the railway, engaging in liaison and progress. Here are a few methods for discussion.</p>
<p>(1) Implementing Water-Land Intermodal Transport Along the Line. There are many waterways along the lines of the national railways, and the transportation of agricultural products to the market relies heavily on waterways, and there are often cases where the railway is abandoned in favor of roundabout waterways due to high railway freight rates and complicated procedures. This morbidity is half due to freight rates and half due to the lack of intermodal transport. There are many types of ships sailing in the inland rivers of our country, but they are roughly divided into three types: steamers, sailing ships, and other small boats. For regular steamers that can be connected to railway stations, the railway should sign a cargo intermodal transport contract with them. All goods loaded from ships to cars or from cars to ships should be handled by the railway or the shipping company on behalf of the shippers, without the need for shippers to handle them themselves. Both parties stipulate the sailing time, striving for accuracy, and convenience is better than today's slow transportation. Then the export of inland agricultural products can be increased due to convenience and low price. For those who transport agricultural products by inland river sailing ships and small boats, because there is no possibility of signing an intermodal transport contract, the railway should also build suitable wharves for them, providing loading and unloading equipment and manpower, so that loading from ships to cars is without any difficulty. At the same time, regular less-than-carload refrigerated and heated trains are operated to carry this small amount of agricultural products, so that they can be transported farther and expand their sales. Although this is not true intermodal transport, it is also a broad sense of intermodal transport. Some of the national railways have already implemented water-land passenger intermodal transport, but cargo intermodal transport is still lacking. For the convenience of agricultural product transportation, it should be planned and implemented urgently.</p>
<p>(2) Promoting Railway and Highway Intermodal Transport. There are still many long-distance bus companies in various parts of our country, with passenger transport as their main business. Even those that also operate freight transport are probably not many. However, highways penetrate deep into inland villages and towns and are truly a useful tool for collecting rural agricultural products. It is urgent to establish or promote its parcel and freight business, engaging in the collection and distribution of agricultural products, so that inland products can be transported conveniently to large cities, increasing their effectiveness and expanding their sales, which is beneficial to both the roads and the people. Among the national railways, some have already signed passenger intermodal transport contracts with highways or long-distance bus companies. Now, further consultations should be made to extend the intermodal transport method to parcel and cargo business, so that agricultural products have one more way to vent, and transportation has one more boost to development. The railway and highway are linked into a whole system, and its effectiveness must not be lower than water-land intermodal transport.</p>
<p>(3) Building Routes Deep into Production Areas. Our country's railways are mostly limited to main lines, and there are very few branch lines. The places they pass through are mostly large towns and cities, and they cannot penetrate deep into the countryside, which is a major reason for the failure of agricultural products to develop. Looking at the railways of developed countries, they are as dense as spider webs. Although there are many main lines among them, the formation of the web is mostly due to the development of branch lines. Branch lines are the source of nutrition for the main lines. It is irrelevant whether there are waterways or highways along the railway line, and even if there are, they may not all be able to collect agricultural products. The waterways are naturally formed, and the places they pass through may not be convenient for the export of agricultural products. Highways are mostly based on passenger transport, and even if there is freight transport, their transportation capacity must be weak. Whole carload transport still depends on the railway. Moreover, although water-land intermodal transport is more convenient than non-intermodal transport, it still involves a lot of expenses in one lift and one drop, one load and one unload. It is better to build railway branch lines, penetrate deep into the people, and engage in collection, from the place of production to the market, completing it in one go, which is cheaper and faster. Therefore, the existing roads should gradually lay branch lines in the main agricultural production areas along the line to connect and attract them, so that the products of the inland rural areas do not have to be transported back and forth, and can be transported to the destination in one turn, saving time and money. It goes without saying that it is beneficial to the distribution of agricultural products. However, the financial resources of the current roads are weak, and borrowing money is not easy. It is difficult to build a large number of branch lines in one fell swoop. Therefore, in order to meet the current needs, the railway may purchase considerable ships or build rural roads to connect and engage in the collection and distribution of agricultural products as an aid to the trunk line transportation business, which is also an expedient and effective method.</p>
<p>Finally, there is one more thing that cannot be ignored for saving the rural economy. In recent years, rural finance has been exhausted. There is no surplus capital to improve production, and there is no financial resources to accumulate harvests. Even if loans can be obtained, they are mostly high-interest. The hardship of farmers' lives is due to the contraction of finance, which is very profound. The reason for this is that idle funds flow out, and all loans are heavily indirect, resulting in extremely high interest rates, which is extremely harmful to the people. Looking back at the large cities, finance is stagnant, and there is no way to vent. Commercial loans have very low interest rates. This kind of abnormal morbidity is ultimately not a long-term solution. It is hoped that financiers will take their surplus funds and go deep into the rural areas to organize farmers' lending offices in various places, directly lending money to farmers at low interest rates, so that farmers' loans must not be handled by intermediaries and be exploited by them. Once finance is eased, agricultural products can be improved, exported, and the risk of temporary dumping and price reduction can be avoided. For financiers, surplus funds can be vented, turning useless into useful; for transportation operators, the volume of agricultural products can be increased, and the purchasing power of farmers can be increased; everything is prepared in one fell swoop, and it is hoped that financiers from all over the world will plan for it as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>The Problem of Work Reduction in Chinese Cotton Mills</h3>
<p>Implementation of Anti-Dumping Duties is the Only Solution</p>
<p>According to the late edition of the newspaper on the 21st of this month, more than 80 cotton mills across the country, in accordance with the resolution of the Cotton Mill Federation, will implement a 23% work reduction from the 22nd, that is, stop operating day and night shifts on Saturdays and Sundays. The reason for this is that the sales of Chinese cotton yarn have been affected by the dumping of foreign yarn to the point of desperation. If we do not seek remedies quickly, we will inevitably declare bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Before the mutual trade between China and foreign countries, our country's farming families, men plowing and women weaving, all the clothing needs were provided by themselves, and there was no lack. Since the intrusion of foreign loans, our country's family handicraft industry has declared complete bankruptcy due to high costs and poor quality, which is not enough to compete with the cheap and high-quality foreign goods made by machines. Those who could weave and wear clothes themselves at first had to rely on others for supply. At the same time, it is inevitable for the Chinese to imitate foreign goods and set up factories to manufacture them. However, in modern commodity competition, the value lies in excellent technology, huge output, low cost, and excellent quality, so that they can compete with others. Our country's economy is backward and cannot be compared with advanced capitalist countries. It is not only cotton mills that are like this, but all other industries are like this. Therefore, since the opening of our country's cotton mills, they have been oppressed by foreign goods, not only has there been considerable progress, but the import of cotton yarn has been a powerful competitor to the production of Chinese cotton yarn. Various countries have also taken advantage of our country's low labor costs and convenient access to raw materials to compete in setting up factories in our country. With their huge capital, excellent machinery, and pure talent and technology, our country's cotton mills cannot be expected to catch up with them, and it is inevitable that they will be oppressed and fall behind.</p>
<p>All independent countries in the world have absolute sovereignty over protecting their domestic industries, but our country is not. In the past, restricted by the tariff agreement, we could not freely increase taxes on imported foreign yarn, and we could not crack down on domestic and foreign factories, so that domestic goods had no way to be protected. In addition, due to inconsistent orders and the establishment of numerous likin stations in various places, the burden on domestic yarn was even greater than that on foreign yarn, which led to the increasing prevalence of foreign goods. In February 1931, the unified tax was implemented and likin was abolished. On the surface, although it is said that domestic yarn still did not receive better protection than foreign yarn, it was also treated equally, and the long-standing problem of domestic yarn bearing a heavier burden than foreign yarn could be avoided. However, as listed in Article 12, the unified tax rate for cotton yarn manufactured domestically and imported from abroad, all plain cotton yarn, regardless of the number of strands, within 23 counts, is taxed at 2 yuan and 75 cents per 100 catties, and those above 23 counts are taxed at 3 yuan and 75 cents per 100 catties. Other types of cotton yarn, regardless of the number of strands, mercerized and all bleached or colored cotton yarn, regardless of the number of counts, are subject to a unified tax of 5% based on the customs valuation. As Shanghai Daily News said on April 8 at the time: (The superior position of Japanese merchants over Chinese merchants lies in the division of tax rates, the so-called 23 counts as the boundary. The products of Chinese and Japanese cotton mills have a distinction between coarse and fine. Japanese merchants divide 20 counts as the center and 42 counts as the center. Chinese merchants divide 10 counts and 16 counts as the center. Now, 2 yuan and 75 cents per 100 catties are levied on all items below 23 counts. Therefore, yarn close to 23 counts is the most beneficial. It is very clear that Chinese merchants take 10 counts and 16 counts as the center, which is more advantageous than Japanese merchants who take 20 counts as the center, and should stand in a disadvantageous position. As for 3 yuan and 75 cents per 100 catties on all items above 23 counts, the Japanese merchants who take 42 counts as the center will definitely not be at a disadvantage.) Japanese merchants are at the center of foreign cotton mills in China, and although the number of factories is not as large as that of Chinese merchants, the number of spindles is twice as large. It seems that the implementation of the unified tax has instead helped foreign yarn to increase its dumping opportunities.</p>
<p>Recently, with the Japanese army invading North China, a part of the market for domestic yarn has been lost. In recent years, the rural economy has declined, and the purchasing power of the general public has decreased. Chinese cotton mills have felt the pain of being unable to maintain themselves. Because they are affected by the domestic resistance to Japanese goods, Japanese merchants have to increase their dumping efforts to maintain their lives. Chinese cotton mills feel the pressure of overproduction even more. Even if they are not closed, they have to resort to work reduction. It is true that work reduction arises from overproduction. However, in terms of last year, the total number of spindles in the country was only 4,516,818, of which Chinese merchants only accounted for 2,589,040, about 57.31% of the total. This is far from enough to supply the needs of the people across the country for clothing. No matter how much the purchasing power declines, there will never be a phenomenon of overproduction. It is known that the work reduction of Chinese cotton mills today is purely due to the impact of foreign yarn dumping, which is very obvious. However, the stagnation of sales caused by foreign goods dumping cannot be solved by work reduction. The result of work reduction not only does not help maintain the business of cotton mills, but even gives foreign goods more favorable dumping opportunities. Our country's silk mills are dying. Will cotton mills also follow in their footsteps?</p>
<p>Although it is said that the impact of work reduction on the labor side is: reducing three shifts every week, each worker actually only reduces one shift, and only four or five shifts a month, which is only worth more than two yuan at 60 cents per shift. This is really the words of those who do not understand the truth. Chinese cotton mills are competing with foreign yarn. Because their technology and capital are inferior, they are at a disadvantage everywhere. To reduce costs and facilitate competition, reducing wages is also a method. Therefore, the wages of workers in Chinese cotton mills can be said to have been shortened to the lowest level. Maintaining the lowest level of life is often unsustainable. How can they reduce their income by two or three yuan per month? In fact, for a large part of the workers, this amount is already half of their total wages.</p>
<p>In the current situation where various industries are declining, we do not overemphasize the problem of work reduction in Chinese cotton mills. However, by this example, the problem is a microcosm of the overall problem. Foreign yarn dumping has always been a major problem for our country's textile industry, but it is by no means impossible to solve. In recent months, we have repeatedly seen news that the government will implement anti-dumping duties, and there is a saying that it will start with cotton yarn from May 1. If so, the problem of work reduction in Chinese cotton mills will not be difficult to solve. What is feared is, first, whether it can be implemented as scheduled, or whether it is only a proposal of the industrial and commercial conference, as in 1919. Second, the dumping of foreign yarn is not limited to foreign imports. Domestic and foreign yarn mills are the main culprits. If anti-dumping duties can be implemented, we must also pay attention to the dumping of foreign yarn manufactured in China. Otherwise, it will be like the unified tax before, and domestic yarn mills will still not get the real benefits. The implementation of anti-dumping duties and the work reduction of Chinese cotton mills happened at the same time. The future of our country's industry can be seen by analogy.</p>
<h3>The Abandonment of the Treaty Between Japan and India and the Sino-Japanese Tariff Agreement</h3>
<p>Japanese Trade Will Fall into Despair</p>
<p>Since the Indian Legislative Assembly proposed the Anti-Dumping Act on the 8th of this month, the Indian government decided to abolish the Japan-India Trade Treaty signed in 1905 (Meiji 37). It was unanimously passed on the 12th. At the same time, the British government officially notified Japan that in accordance with the provisions of the treaty, most-favored-nation treatment would be completely invalid six months after the declaration. In reviewing the reason why Britain took this extraordinary measure, on the surface it is a means for India to defend against the reduction and dumping of Japanese goods outside the law, but in fact it will further completely expel Japanese goods within and outside British territories. Therefore, after receiving the notice of abandonment, both the government and the public in Japan were shocked. India, which has always occupied the second place in foreign trade, is afraid that it will cut off sales channels because of this. In recent years, the dumping of Japanese goods overseas is like mercury pouring on the ground, penetrating everywhere. Therefore, the trade of various countries has been greatly affected. Among them, Britain, which has the most colonies, has been particularly affected. Almost all British markets have been overwhelmed by Japanese goods, resulting in the decline of British industry and the increase in unemployment. In addition, with the depreciation of exchange rates, Japan took this opportunity to compete fiercely. Britain is difficult to compare with Japan in terms of production costs. In the cotton textile category, the yarn factory operators in India and Lancaster yarn factory operators have fallen sharply. After a detailed investigation by the Bombay Yarn Factory Association last year, it was decided to increase tariffs, reduce production costs, and improve the sales system as a defense. However, the situation between Japan and the two countries of Britain and India is different, and various plans have ultimately failed to achieve results. Later, it was proposed to adopt a combined specific and ad valorem tax system, but it was still difficult to prevent the dumping of Japanese goods. It happened that the Japan-India Trade Treaty expired in March of this year. In order to recover the situation of the Indian and Lancaster yarn factory industries and to comply with the US international relations, Britain resolutely abandoned the treaty. Although the major products such as cotton and wool in India have always been sold to Japan in large quantities, Britain, because Japan has withdrawn from the alliance, estimates the international situation, and in order to implement the unified economic system of the Ottawa Conference, weighs the advantages and disadvantages and has to take severe measures to prevent future troubles. In the recent three years, Japan's trade with India has made considerable progress. The value of Japan's exports to India last year exceeded 76 million yuan. The main exports are mostly cotton textiles and silk textiles. Last year, the value of Japanese cotton textiles imported into India was as high as 80 million yuan, and silk textiles were 33 million yuan. (Last year, Japan's exports to the United States were 445 million yuan, to India 290 million yuan, and to China 140 million yuan.) Due to exchange rate relations, they have increased more and more. Britain and India were constrained by the trade treaty and have been enduring the pain until now, eager to abandon the old treaty so that after the expiration, they can levy the highest rate of tariffs and restore their own industries, which is a win-win strategy. Now, because of the abandonment of the old treaty and the failure to establish a new treaty, and because it will be treated harshly after the expiration, the national market has suddenly become chaotic. All textile industries and daily necessities industries are extremely panicky due to the sudden loss of sales channels. In addition, the social economy has been gradually shaken in recent years, and the loss of this large number of sales channels will inevitably lead to the contraction of various industries, and the contraction of the scope will inevitably increase unemployed workers. Since September 18, due to the reduction of sales channels to China, it was intended to expand the situation in India to make up for the shortage. Unexpectedly, the change occurred suddenly, giving it a fatal blow. This is something that Japan did not expect.</p>
<p>Not only that, but Turkey has also announced the abandonment of the Japan-Turkey Treaty of Commerce and Navigation due to the indiscriminate sale of Japanese goods. The same is true for the Philippines. According to the opinion of our diplomatic authorities, the Sino-Japanese Reciprocal Tariff Agreement, which expires on May 15, is also unnecessary to continue. If so, the dumping of Japanese goods in the countries of the East will fall into despair.</p>
<p>The current Sino-Japanese treaty is based on the Sino-Japanese Treaty of Commerce and Navigation of 1896 and the Additional Treaty of 1903. The treaty was originally scheduled to expire in October 1926. Later, due to domestic turmoil, the competition for power was not enough, let alone the amendment of the treaty. Therefore, the original treaty continued to be implemented. Until 1928, the National Government issued a declaration to abandon unequal treaties. Britain, the United States, Germany, France and other countries successively concluded new treaties with our country. Only for the Sino-Japanese Treaty of Commerce, due to the obstruction of the Japanese side, the negotiations between the two sides were quite difficult. It was not until May 6, 1930, that it was concluded. This is the tariff agreement that is in force today.</p>
<p>According to the content of the treaty, based on the most-favored-nation treatment, all cotton fabrics, seafood products, wheat flour and other miscellaneous goods imported from Japan into our country are subject to the agreed tax rate for three years from May 16, 1930. This agreed tax rate is based on the 1926 tariff. Later, in 1931, our country promulgated the national tax rate. Due to the treaty, it could not be increased in the agreed items. In recent years, the value of Japanese goods imported into our country has reached about 300 million yuan per year. As for our country's exports to Japan, they are mostly raw materials and semi-finished products. According to the principles of economics, the loss between exporting raw materials and crude products and turning them into imported refined products is more than just multiples. Moreover, the items that our country has reciprocity with are only ramie cloth and silk, which are very few in exports to Japan. With this reciprocity, it can only be seen as a biased benefit. They took advantage of the exhausted social economy of our country to do everything possible to dump, resulting in the decline of our country's industry. Therefore, there is no reason to continue the current Sino-Japanese Tariff Agreement, and since it has lost these two major customers in East Asia, the economic danger in their country can be imagined.

<h3>Securities: The Mystery Surrounding the Situation in Beiping and Tianjin Envelops Last Week's Bond Market</h3>
<p>Prices fell during the first half of the week and rebounded in the second half.</p>
<p>Price differences ranged from 45 "jiao" to over one yuan.</p>
<p>Last week, from April 17th to 22nd, the Shanghai Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange experienced significant market volatility. Following the loss of various ports in the Northeast war, Qinhuangdao also fell, and counties in eastern Hebei had to be abandoned. As the nation's territory shrank and Beiping and Tianjin became increasingly endangered, Tongxian near Beiping and Tangshan near Tianjin were destabilized by bombings. The market became a breeding ground for rumors, and the atmosphere was tense, with alarms sounding frequently throughout the day. Although the fundamentals of bonds remained solid, it was like lush branches on a tree with roots gradually weakening. People were uneasy, and prices plummeted. On Monday, the fall of Qinhuangdao was confirmed. On Tuesday and Wednesday, counties in eastern Hebei were abandoned. Speculators engaged in extensive activities, predicting inevitable unrest in Beiping and Tianjin. The market was filled with sell orders. Major players in the 38, 54, and other bonds emerged to sell. Financial institutions also joined the selling pressure, with some even exacerbating the situation. Prices fell sharply each day. As the settlement date for April approached, major players panicked and could no longer hold their positions. Although the decline was not steep enough to trigger price limits because the discounts were not excessively high, the lack of any sign of recovery over three days was alarming. The main goal of speculators was to cause disruption in Beiping and Tianjin. On Thursday, with news indicating no immediate danger, Guangdong-based short sellers began to cover their positions, and the short-selling camp started to waver. Financial institutions also began buying. Bond No. 20 was in particularly high demand, and prices rebounded by more than one yuan. On Friday, after repeated government assurances that Beiping and Tianjin could be secured, northern traders engaged in frantic buying, and retail investors also covered their positions, leading to further gains of several "jiao" to one and a half yuan. On Saturday, the market became slightly chaotic, with fewer transactions and a slight decline of several "jiao." The week's market performance resulted in an overall decline of 45 "jiao" to over one yuan. In summary, the activities of speculators throughout the week were entirely driven by the mystery surrounding the situation in Beiping and Tianjin, inevitably leading to criticism of groping in the dark. In a time of national crisis, it is not only the public bond market that is unstable. The total transaction volume was 72,554,000 yuan, including 29,000 yuan in spot transactions. Futures contracts for consolidated salt tax accounted for over one-third, totaling 26.9 million yuan. Disbandment bonds accounted for over 13 million yuan, and 1922 customs bonds totaled between 13 and 14 million yuan. 2022 customs bonds also amounted to 14 million plus change. Reorganization bonds also had over 3 million. 182696 customs bonds were all less than 500,000 yuan. The settlement date for April has been set for the 28th, so futures trading for this month will continue until the 20th.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn: Telegrams Indicate More Increases Than Decreases</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton prices initially weakened due to mass selling but later rebounded due to reactive buying and short covering. Futures prices rose by 7 to 12 points, while spot prices increased by 5 points. English cotton futures fell by 2-3 points, while spot prices rose by 3 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices increased by 3 points. Indian cotton initially weakened due to profit-taking by major players but later rebounded due to buying by European exporters.

<h3>Silk: A Lingering Spring Chill Hinders Sericulture</h3>
<p>Shaoxing: The Shaoxing region initiates silkworm farming earliest, and farmers regard sericulture as a significant secondary occupation. However, in the past two years, repeated crop failures and low cocoon prices have resulted in substantial losses. Consequently, the number of spring silkworm farmers this year is only 70-80% of last year's. Due to economic constraints, farmers lack the capital to purchase improved breeds and instead incubate local varieties. The quantity of hatched silkworms is only 75% of last year's. Cold weather during hatching led to uneven hatching, with many silkworms failing to emerge. Subsequent cold, rainy weather for weeks has significantly impacted silkworm development, causing widespread disease. In areas like Lizhu and Tianle Township, early silkworms have reached the third molt and begun leaf consumption, but they are rejecting the rain-soaked leaves and exhibiting signs of jaundice. In areas like Anchang, Taiping Bridge, Xiaojiang, and Anren Township, late silkworms are failing to molt and are developing white muscardine disease, resulting in substantial losses.</p>
<p>Xinchang: Farmers in various towns and villages of Xinchang have traditionally shown strong interest in silkworm farming. However, continuous losses in recent years have significantly dampened their enthusiasm. This year, the number of silkworms raised is relatively robust in areas like Huangze. However, the local varieties raised, such as Yuhang Zhugui, have suffered significant losses after the first molt and leaf consumption due to the cold weather. Currently, early silkworms in areas like Jiao'an and Meizhu have reached the third molt and begun leaf consumption, while late silkworms in areas like Ma Chexi and Xixi are only in the second molt, having consumed leaves for three to four days. Continuous rain makes it difficult for farmers to feed the silkworms. Rural areas also lack drying facilities, requiring farmers to dry the wet leaves before feeding them. A bountiful silkworm harvest is unlikely this year.</p>
<h3>Recent Tea News from Wuyuan</h3>
<p>(Tea Leaves Have Shown Green Shoots) In Wuyuan County, tea trees are diligently cultivated, leading to increased production. Since the beginning of this spring, cold weather and continuous rain and snow have slowed the development of tea trees in both mountainous and flat areas. However, in the past two weeks, the weather has suddenly warmed up, with favorable sunny and rainy conditions. The tea trees in fertile and young areas have shown green shoots. Recent intermittent sunshine and rain have further stimulated sprout growth. However, due to frost damage last winter and this spring, the buds on the branches are sparse and not thriving. According to tea farmers, this year's tea production will definitely be lower than last year's.</p>
<p>(Mountain Farmers Lack Capital for Tea Production) Most tea mountain farmers are poor. Traditionally, they would borrow money from tea firms near the end of the lunar year to cover their urgent needs. However, last year, tea firms suffered losses and have no funds to lend. While some may offer small amounts of assistance, it is like a cup of water trying to put out a cartload of fire. With the new tea season approaching, tea farmers need rice and food, but shops generally refuse to extend credit, leaving them unable to purchase supplies and lamenting their plight.</p>
<p>(Price of Firewood, Charcoal, and Crate Boards Declines) In recent years, the demand for firewood, charcoal, and crate boards has been high, leading to rising prices, which helped sustain the livelihoods of mountain farmers. This year, due to significant losses incurred by various firms last year, those who previously made advance payments for orders have now stopped purchasing. Mountain farmers, burdened by economic hardship, are forced to sell at reduced prices. Firewood, previously priced at one "dan" and a half per yuan, is now selling for three "dan." Charcoal, previously priced at 70 "jin" per yuan, has fallen to 140 "jin." Crate boards, previously priced at 40 yuan per hundred, are now selling for 20 yuan, a reduction of half the price.</p>
<p>(Tea Bank Tightens Exchange) The tea banks stationed in Wuyuan that issue drafts include Hong Yuan Yong, Zhongxin Chang, Yongsheng Chang, Yuan Yanrun, Rende Yong, Shengchang Sheng, Yongxing Long, and Shen Yuan, totaling eight firms. They typically issue substantial amounts of tea money, and there is usually no shortage of funds. However, this year, the initial intention of various banks is to tighten the issuance of drafts. As of now, no tea firm has received drafts from the banks, creating an exceptionally tight financial situation.</p>
<p>(Tea Firms Remain Cautious) Tea firms, having suffered significant losses last year, have had their vitality depleted. Firms with limited capital find it difficult to open for business as desired, while those with substantial capital are adopting a cautious approach, observing the sluggish overseas markets. The lack of enthusiasm is markedly different from the past.</p>
<p>(Tea Workers Flock to Hangzhou and Shanghai) The county boasts a large number of tea masters and workers, whose tea-making skills are highly refined compared to other places. Tea firms and tea merchants across the country employ tea workers from Wuyuan, making it a specialized profession. This year, with an increase in native firms and tea merchants in Hangzhou and Shanghai, no fewer than a thousand local tea masters and workers have been hired to work in Hangzhou, Shanghai, Qimen, Fuliang, and Jianxi, offering a new path amidst widespread unemployment and gloom.</p>
<h3>Grain: Southern Rice Market Active, Prices Slightly Higher</h3>
<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, there were over 30 suppliers, and the market became more active. Initial trading was scarce, but the market suddenly became lively later. Sellers gradually tightened their prices. However, because supply wasn't scarce and there was a significant amount of goods in the warehouse, market prices were restricted. Well-regarded rice from Suzhou and Tongzhou was up slightly. Good rice from Nangang remained steady. Thin rice, with the arrival of one ship from Tianjin and Shanghai, saw more active trading. For example, green-tip rice from Qingjiao and Tianjin were purchased, along with over 1000 packages of thin rice from Qingjiao and over 500 packages from Songjiang. Therefore, market prices were higher. If the supply becomes scarce, there is still hope for further improvement. Du Yang pointed rice showed a promising outlook, but the market remained stable.</p>

<h3>Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Decline, Sales Quiet</h3>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Further Clarification for Chairman Lu</h3>
<p>— Tian Fang</p>
<p>Shandong truly lives up to its reputation as the hometown of Confucius. The so-called "Land of Rituals and Music of Qi and Lu" has held a glorious position in history. Even today, though I haven't visited Jinan or the Temple of the Sage, and I'm not a diviner, I still feel that this region is full of ancient charm and is enchantingly beautiful. Besides the unearthed antiquities, there is a constant stream of (True Mandate of Heaven) (National Salvation Wealth Gods) being born. The land is spirited, and the people are outstanding, making it the center of the restoration movement.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is because of the worsening national crisis that the Land of Ancient Texts is forced to reorganize and set up a fighting arena. In this martial arts competition, besides using real weapons, there is also a wide search for people (With Superhuman Skills) such as (Flying on Roofs and Scaling Walls, and Acupressure) to come to Lu and demonstrate their skills. According to the Jinan news report of the 20th, (Flying on Roofs and Scaling Walls, and Acupressure skills are found in unofficial novels and records from the Tang Dynasty, and many are even more miraculous. Shandong province has scheduled a provincial martial arts competition from May 14th. The Martial Arts Hall issued a notice saying (By order of the Chairman, Flying on Roofs and Scaling Walls, and Acupressure are inherent skills of our nation, passed down to the present, but have gradually been lost. Therefore, this provincial exam must add this subject in order to promote lost knowledge.) Alas, how grand! From afar, I imagine (Throughout the Nation) (People With Superhuman Skills) like Qiu Ran, Hong Xian, Nie Yinniang, Kunlun Slave, Huang Tianba and Bai Yutang, will (Gather Together) to offer their skills. The roads of Shandong will be as overwhelmed as the roads of Shanyin. Alas, how grand!</p>
<p>Since the Western Devils' cannons were introduced to China, the fashion of wielding spears and sticks has gradually declined. The gallantry of playboys causing trouble and heroes helping those in need has also become less common. The imposing (Swords Drawn) has now become (Guns Fired in the Dark). What a disappointment! The essence of the nation is being lost, and those with hearts cannot but worry. Fortunately, the distant past is not so far off, and it is still possible to promote it now. Although the whereabouts of Yue Nv and Qiu Ran are uncertain, descendants of figures from the Tales of the Wandering Heroes and the Guillotine, probably still exist. With the heart to promote lost knowledge, and to prepare for common hatred of the enemy, let this group of people (Who Can Fly High and Go Far) sneak into the enemy camp on dark and quiet nights. All they need is a weapon at the waist. With a swing, the heads of (X Teng) (X Teng) and others will fall to the ground. It is like taking something out of a pocket. The common saying is (To Catch Thieves, Catch the Leader). Isn't this easier, faster, and more reliable than using broadswords in hand-to-hand combat and failing to kill the enemy's general? If the method of acupressure is used, making the enemies as still as wooden chickens, unable to raise their knives or fire their guns, like the scene written in (Unofficial Novels), it would be quite a sight. Moreover, this way, innocent casualties can be avoided, which is even more in line with the spirit of benevolence. We should buy firecrackers in advance to celebrate the success.</p>
<p>What a pity, however, is that the skills of (Flying on Roofs and Scaling Walls, and Acupressure) are convenient, but they still require moving hands and feet, which feels a bit inconvenient. According to the records in (Unofficial Novels), in ancient times, there were people who could summon clouds and move fog. With a stretch of their fingers, the sky would darken, and with a chanting of a spell, souls would be lost. Their (Miracles) are even above the skills of (Flying on Roofs and Scaling Walls, and Acupressure). There are many examples in Journey to the West and Investiture of the Gods, and the loss of these skills is not only (Gradual). If the Chairman can prepare more (Incense and Candles) for the prizes, transportation, accommodation, and food, and sincerely plead, perhaps Heaven will have mercy and attract one or two Sun Wukongs or Erlangs to descend. Then, with a wave of the golden staff and a bark of the divine dog, all the birds will be reduced to powder, and the 70 million Japanese pirates will enter the dog's belly. Wouldn't that be even more direct? Compared to military resistance, it is truly redundant, and the skills of Flying on Roofs and Scaling Walls are also overshadowed. It is truly the best strategy for resisting Japan and saving the nation. Jinan is very close to Mount Tai. I urge the Chairman to climb the Peak of the Day Watch and pray sincerely to the heavens, sending an immortal general or any deity to descend and save the nation. Sincerity can move Heaven. If you can do so, it will surely have unexpected effects. We will wait and see!</p>

<h3>Bakelite</h3>
<p>— Huan</p>
<p>In the showcases of large companies and on the counters of the City God Temple, we can see newly available red, green, and beautifully colored cups, dishes, pots, and other utensils. Their texture is like wood, very light, and commonly called Bakelite. Recently, new Bakelite utensils are slowly increasing. Before understanding them, many people are skeptical and dare not try them. Therefore, I find it necessary to write this article.</p>
<p>It is not made from a natural product, but from a chemical. It is more flexible and durable than (Celluloid): It does not catch fire: It does not melt: It does not dissolve in any solvent: Even boiling it with dilute sulfuric acid does not affect it. Its best quality is that it is non-conductive. If wooden or metal implements are immersed in its solution, a bright and beautiful film can form, like paint, protecting the wood from decay and the metal from rust. Its method of manufacture is as follows: (1) 2CH3OH + O2 = 2CH2O + 2H2O (Water) (Alcohol) (Oxygen) (Formalin) (FORMALIN) (2) Formalin + Phenolic Acid = Bakelite (PHEN6) (With ammonia as a catalyst) Freshly made Bakelite is a glue-like substance. This substance can be dissolved in solutions such as alcohol and acetone (ACETONE). But heating this substance to 100 degrees Celsius or 212 degrees Fahrenheit turns it into a hard, resin-like solid. This is what is now called Bakelite.</p>
<p>Its biggest use is in the electrical industry. Switches, insulators, and other objects can be used in place of rubber. Because its elasticity is similar to ivory, it can be used to make bullets. Because it is cheap and good, buttons, umbrella handles, knife handles, handles, and other items can be used to replace the uses of ivory, celluloid, and rubber.</p>
<h3>Where is the Way Out?</h3>
<p>— Kuang Bei</p>
<p>The time was already dusk, but the lamps were not yet lit. He, Mr. Fang, stood in the hazy twilight at the foot of the stairs, in the countryside, staring blankly at the avenue that cut diagonally across the east, the thought of leaving his hometown and going to Shanghai to make a living arising in his mind.</p>
<p>XXX When he was studying at the Normal School in the county seat five years ago, he deeply felt the detestable frivolity of city life. He wanted to correct this distorted social pathology and believed the only way was to return to the countryside. Moreover, the prosperity of society was originally built on the countryside. This was his self-encouraging, yet uncommon, view and ambition. Because he came from a Normal School background, he entered the life of a primary school teacher as soon as he returned home, and he never had any extravagant hopes for himself.</p>
<p>At that time, although his village was not some (model village)</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>, (earthly paradise), it was a self-sufficient, simple and honest piece of pure land. Later, things gradually changed, but in order to desperately struggle for society and for his own life, he never lost heart or neglected his duties.</p>
<p>This is his recent mood. He often felt as if a heavy, unliftable stone was pressing down on his heart. Every time during the dusk hours after class, when he strolled around in front of the stairs or in the countryside, he could not avoid these sighs:</p>
<p>In the past, the fields, ponds, and hillsides were all places for planting, which gave him a new discovery: That's why food was cheap in the past, and that's why farmers lived prosperous lives. Now, all you see are patches of wasteland, with no one cultivating them, as if everyone doesn't care about farming anymore.</p>
<p>In the past, the mountains were covered with lush trees, but now they are bare.</p>
<p>Most of all, the Baijia Chong in the west used to truly live up to its name, so lively. Every evening, smoke curled out of the chimneys of every house, facing the warm southern wind, gradually merging into thin clouds that drifted far to the north, as if containing endless rural leisure and joy in life. But now, most of the so-called houses of a hundred families have collapsed, with only piles of broken walls and tiles overgrown with weeds and moss. The curling smoke is naturally scattered and does not convey any leisurely scenes drifting westward.</p>
<p>He looked, he reminisced, and another scene emerged in his mind:</p>
<p>The floods of the year before last submerged all the land in the Chong. After the bandit raids last year, a large number of soldiers were stationed in the countryside, consuming even more food. Most of all, one group left, and another group came, making people panic and uneasy. Some even abandoned their families and followed along, so the number of able-bodied men in the village dwindled. The women also only cared about wandering around and playing, and did not care about the important matters of farming.</p>
<p>He thought about this and that, the beginning and the end, as if it were the prologue to his own tumbling journey, all confirming these social realities. Seeing that he himself was also approaching a state of disaster, his teaching life was getting worse year after year.</p>
<p>XXX</p>
<p>It is said that Shanghai is a land of gold. In the hazy twilight, he stood in front of the stairs, in the countryside, staring blankly at the avenue that cut diagonally across the east, the thought of leaving his hometown and going to Shanghai to make a living arising in his mind.</p>
<p>But it is said that of those who go to Shanghai, nine out of ten are unemployed, hungry, and freezing, eventually committing suicide with no good ending.</p>
<h3>Literature</h3>
<p>— Nancun</p>
<p>The Japanese bandits invaded our borders. Under the policy of non-resistance, the flags of Japan were hoisted high in the four northeastern provinces, and puppets were put on stage. All four hundred million of our compatriots were filled with fury. Now, I compose a (Man Jiang Hong) to encourage my compatriots to resist Japan.</p>
<p>Northeast winds rise fiercely, compatriots' hair bristles with anger, ascending to a height, looking far away, six years of military administration, dust and earth, three thousand miles, clouds and moon, do not idly indulge in conspiracies, only grieve, national shame, has not yet been avenged, compatriots' hatred, when will it be extinguished, conquer the whole fortress, smash the hibiscus palace, ambitious to eat the flesh of the Japanese bandits, laugh and talk, quench thirst with the blood of enemies, wait to reclaim the old rivers and mountains, to celebrate the triumphant return.</p>
<h3>Advocating Patriotic Songs to Save the Nation</h3>
<p>— Hou Ying</p>
<p>Since the national crisis, our Chinese methods of saving the nation have been as numerous as bamboo shoots after the rain, a dazzling array. Among them, of course, there are many that are reasonable and justifiable; but I believe that these methods of saving the nation, apart from people in the intellectual class, I'm afraid will not have much effect. But our Chinese intellectual class, speaking of which is truly pitiful, among a hundred people, I don't know if there are even ten people; compared to rare treasures, it is almost the same. Therefore, in order to obtain satisfactory results in saving the nation in this country where education is not widespread, it is only effective after first making the general public feel (the difficulties of the country, the tyranny of the enemy).</p>
<p>Small folk songs, in our country's commoner society, can be considered the most powerful and active propaganda. No matter where you are, even in remote villages, when a group of people are resting after work, you can hear them singing "lang ya lang, jie ya jie," up and down. Although they are illiterate, the popularity of these folk songs is very great: because the words are colloquial and the tunes are rhyming, they find it easy to learn and enjoyable to sing, so they can spread from one to two, and from two to three without feet.</p>
<p>Now, I believe that we should first compile a kind of folk song that is full of patriotic thoughts, as well as propaganda about the enemy's ferocity and the killing of compatriots. But, first: the words must be as common as possible; second: the tone must be smooth. In this way, over time, they will have a considerable understanding of the country and the enemy; at that time, if we then propose the above-mentioned methods of saving the nation, I think at least the results will be slightly better than now!</p>
<h3>Regarding Street Urchins</h3>
<p>— Ren</p>
<p>When you pass by Xiaoshadu Road to wait for a tram on Avennue Road, or walk on a section of Metcalfe Road, there will be some ragged, pale, and emaciated children kowtowing and bowing to you, reaching out and shouting, (Fortune Old Man, give me a copper coin:) When you are sitting in a rickshaw and want to go over Sichuan Road Bridge to Laobazi Road, your rickshaw puller bends over, struggling to pull slowly up the bridge with all his might. At this time, three or five vagrants will rush out diagonally, their faces covered with coal ash, their clothes torn like the armor of ancient heroes on the stage, their backs as withered as dry firewood, to help your rickshaw puller pull the cart. After pulling you up the bridge, they will reach out to you (Sir, a copper coin is just a small gesture). Every time you walk or cross a bridge and encounter these street urchins who have never known (home), you may sometimes feel a little compassion and open your purse to give them a couple of coins. Sometimes, you may feel annoyed and shout at them, and they will scatter like frightened birds and beasts. Regarding such things, Shanghai people who have the experience of walking or taking a car across a bridge have all (opened their purse to give coins) or (shouted). However, they forget as soon as they give or shout, and it's as if nothing happened, so they don't leave any vague impressions in their minds at all, and they never even think that these two copper coins are for them to buy a meal or to live for two days. Over time, they are still walking, still taking cars, still crossing bridges, and that group of vagrants who reach out and shout (Fortune Old Man) (Sir, a small gesture) are still living a homeless, wandering, begging, and even stealing life.</p>
<p>In (The Way Out), it introduces us that at the beginning of the Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan, there was also a large group of homeless children wandering the streets. They begged and stole on the streets every day, and passersby deeply regarded them as troublesome headaches, saying that this group of little bastards were born bad seeds and hopeless wild things. But the fact is that it tells us firmly that these poor children are not born bad and are the smartest, most capable, and most expendable producers, as long as someone comes to teach and direct them. Not long ago, the newspaper reported that the Soviet Union was starting to eliminate nearly 100,000 homeless and wandering children again! They prepared 13.7 million rubles to spend on this group of (little bastards) that no one had ever paid attention to. They built many (children's homes) and (juvenile correction centers), gathering the (little rascals), giving them food to eat, education to receive, and teaching them vocational skills. Thus, they are able to and will cultivate land, do business, work, and even make beautiful cameras! This is how amazing and great things are!</p>
<p>That group of blond-haired, blue-eyed wanderers has now been saved. What about our unfortunate group on Xiaoshadu Road, Sichuan Road Bridge, and throughout Shanghai and China? Alas, haven't they left some vague shadows in the minds of the adults and gentlemen!? Although they have also been (shouted at) by adults and gentlemen, or picked up two copper coins on the road that adults and gentlemen threw to them out of some compassion.</p>
<p>Correspondence from Shop Employees</p>
<h3>Unbecoming</h3>
<p>Editor: We often have manufacturers send samples here; according to the usual practice, these samples are distributed to the shop employees. Sometimes, perhaps the manager takes them all for himself. A few days ago, another manufacturer sent some samples; at that time, Mr. So-and-So and I each took one. Unexpectedly, when we got to the door and were about to go out, the manager saw us, and as a result, he snatched them away.</p>
<p>Sir, it wasn't written anywhere that only certain people could take the samples! Why can he treat us like this? Please explain! Sincerely, Tu Tingmei</p>
<p>X X X X</p>
<p>Editor's note: This matter seems very small; but we know that it is very common in Chinese shops, so we specially bring it up for public discussion.</p>
<p>The intention of people sending samples is to ask you to give guidance or to help promote them. Therefore, after receiving the samples, the people in the shop from the manager down should all look at them, comment on them, and promote the good ones for him. For the bad ones, you should also tell the original manufacturer about their shortcomings and try to improve them. If, after they arrive, you snatch them from each other to divide them up, it is really wrong.</p>
<p>Speaking of not specifying who can take them, then of course they are sent to the shop. Not to mention that junior employees cannot take them, even the manager cannot take them. Even if the shop owner does not want this unexpected item, everyone should gather together and distribute them fairly during the holidays. That is the right thing to do.</p>

<h3>Time in a Dream (35th Continuation)</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>(The most critical thing is how you will deal with their student union tomorrow!) Mrs. Liu no longer blamed her husband; she was worried about his position.</p>
<p>(I have already submitted my resignation to Minister X!) Wu Yi frankly revealed all the facts completely. (Ah! This sacrifice of yours seems a bit too much) Mrs. Liu sighed in disappointment. (Dad! Your actions today have grieved me greatly!) Wu Yuan suddenly jumped to the side of the door and said very excitedly: (Since you can no longer maintain your glorious position, I have no face to stay in Nanjing any longer!)</p>
<p>For a son to say such things to his father is a bit too absurd. Wu Yi was also greatly surprised (What are you saying)?</p>
<p>(I'm leaving right away? I'm determined to join the volunteer army!) At school, Wu Yuan had been ridiculed by many classmates. The double stimulation completely boiled the blood in his body: He forcefully pulled open the short door, turned around and left. He did not even say goodbye to his father, only gave him a glare.</p>
<p>(Yuan'er! Yuan'er! Are you crazy)? Mrs. Liu desperately rushed out. However, a loving mother's heart could not bring back the firm will of this young man. His legs moved as fast as flying. He rushed out of the gate in just a few steps. (Yuan'er! Yuan'er!) Mrs. Liu's long, tearful cries were carried in by the sharp western wind, echoing in Wu Yi's ears, making him feel as if he were cut off from the air, his breathing gradually shortened, his blood constantly rising, his face turning redder than if he were drunk, and the scenery in front of him gradually blurred. Before his younger son Wu Hao could rush over to support him, he had already fainted on the warm carpet. The blood that spewed out stained red the single wild goose woven on the carpet.</p>
<p>(15) National Salvation Association</p>
<p>Save the nation! Save the nation! A passionate and moving cry, like the sound of frogs by a green pond in summer, reverberated everywhere. If calculated by the ratio of sweating like rain and breathing like clouds, this earth-shattering commotion seemed enough to scare to death Honjo Shigeru and startle Araki. Unfortunately, the Japanese devils, damn them, were really bold. No matter how hard you shouted, they just took it as some fool on the road singing a mountain song. No one paid attention. Instead, they excitedly deployed troops and generals and rushed forward, clearly intending to make you look bad. At this time, if it were replaced by the big bosses of the American flag on the west coast of the Pacific, or the young masters of France on the European continent, they would have no choice but to let out a burst of anger and fight the Japanese devils, no matter what. Things would of course get bigger! Fortunately, the Chinese are famous for being generous and blessed, and unwilling to take anything seriously. The government has always been as calm as watching a fire from across the river, and the common people just treat it as the opening of a Sino-Japanese football match along the Great Wall, buying an extra copy of the evening newspaper every day, and then washing their hands of the matter!</p>
<p>(Saving the nation with movies, saving the nation with dancing, saving the nation with brothels, saving the nation with horse racing, selling pussy...) A news reporter satirized sadly in the newspaper. Unexpectedly, this made those modern young masters and young ladies have an excuse (to comfort themselves), and they honestly and impolitely began to perform each item, so how could the news reporter do anything about them?</p>

<h3>Greta Garbo's Family</h3>
<p>— Zhuxian</p>
<p>(Her mother does not want to hear her daughter's name)</p>
<p>(As if there is an unspeakable secret)</p>
<p>Greta Garbo's original surname was not Garbo but Gustafsson (GNSTAVSSON), as mentioned briefly last time. Regarding Garbo's life story, few people know. Garbo herself also denies it, so there are many secrets. What is now newly known to the outside world is that Garbo's father and sister have both passed away. Currently, there is a mother and an elder brother, both living in Stockholm, the capital of Sweden. Her brother works as a newspaper clipper and is quite able to support himself. It is said that his appearance is very similar to Garbo's. What is now to be said and is especially noteworthy is her mother.</p>
<p>Garbo's mother is stout and very kind and amiable. An American reporter once went to Stockholm a few years ago. Admiring Garbo's name, he stopped by to visit her mother. At the beginning of the conversation, in addition to pleasantries, he also mentioned the weather in Sweden, the scenery of Stockholm, etc. Mrs. Gustafsson was quite talkative and spoke tirelessly. The reporter then gradually spoke of her daughter Greta, thinking that her mother would be happy to talk about the outlines of her childhood when she heard people talk about her daughter. Unexpectedly, something happened beyond common expectations. When her mother heard her daughter's name, her face changed immediately, and her attitude was no longer as amiable as before. Seeing that the situation was not good, the reporter stopped talking about her daughter, but her mother was never able to restore the friendly state she was in at the beginning of the conversation. Afterwards, the reporter asked others, and her mother absolutely did not talk about her daughter, and also hated hearing people talk about her daughter. Although her daughter has enjoyed great fame and possesses huge wealth, she has very little contact with her. This matter is very strange, not like her mother deliberately making a secret to create another style for her daughter. Or perhaps there is an impossible difference of opinion between mother and daughter, but no one can say what the truth is. Recently, after Garbo returned to her country, she often visited friends, but rarely inquired about her family. This matter can prove that the latter statement is not wrong.</p>
<p>In terms of Garbo's fame in Hollywood, she should be very popular in her home country of Sweden. But in fact, it is not so. It is said that the Swedish people's feelings towards Garbo are not very good. Garbo's films, which were a sensation in the United States, have never been highly praised in Sweden. In Sweden, Jenny MacDonald's name is far above Garbo's. Jenny's (The Merry Widow) played for fifteen weeks in a large theater in Stockholm, with full houses every day. And Garbo and John Gilbert's blockbuster A WOMAN OF AFFAIRS only played for five days and could not be sustained. It is said that after Garbo returned to Sweden this time, the country's feelings towards her have improved compared to before. And the time when Swedish public opinion was most dissatisfied with Garbo was during the Olympic Games held in Los Angeles last year. Now briefly record the outlines as follows: When the Olympic Games were held, all countries, large and small, selected and sent participants. Hollywood stars, because the sports field was close at hand, tried to please and entertain the athletes from various countries. When the Swedish team arrived in the United States, everyone thought that Greta Garbo would definitely sincerely entertain her countrymen. Unexpectedly, Garbo was solitary and put this matter aside. So the news spread to her home country, and public opinion launched a large-scale attack on Garbo. And the matter is not just this small area? There was a polo team among the Swedish athletes, and the team members were all sons of nobles in Sweden. Their leader was an elderly duke. One day, the duke met Garbo on the road while riding. The duke condescended to shake hands with her. Although Garbo looked very respectful, when the duke suggested that he would call the team members out to introduce them to Garbo one by one, Garbo immediately whipped her horse and rode away. Afterwards, the duke returned and told the young men, and the young men all laughed and said, (She doesn't care who cares?) Therefore, domestic public opinion was even more critical of the actress from a humble background. It is said that Garbo's strange behaviors were all advocated by her agent, Halley Eddington, to cater to the curious psychology of the American people. Now that Eddington has left his job and gone elsewhere, Garbo's actions will not be as solitary as before.</p>
<p>Film Commentary</p>
<h3>Review of (Payment Deferred)</h3>
<p>— Si Ping</p>
<p>(Payment Deferred) is a very ordinary film depicting a family tragedy. Although the story of the whole film is still acceptable, because there is no deep background and tortuous interweaving, and no exquisite sets and shocking music, the performance is inevitably too monotonous; and the sudden plot in it is forcibly mixed together, making this film not very natural and realistic.</p>
<p>This film is almost completely based on a family background, narrating that the head of this family, a bank clerk in London, does not have a high income, which makes the family have more expenses than income and is heavily in debt. He himself and his wife and daughter feel the grief of poverty. The weak strength of the virtuous housewife cannot make the family of several people live in poverty, and the head of the family, who is responsible for the family's happiness and misfortune, due to a moment of wrong thinking that he cannot live in poverty, wants to speculate and get rich, and eventually loses his job due to embezzling bank funds. Then comes murder for money. Using ill-gotten wealth, he actually became a rich man by speculation, but he can never escape the morality in his conscience. After having money, he is then tempted by lust. Her daughter glimpsed her father's improper behavior with a mistress, was infected with the ugly state of depravity, and could not avoid falling. His wife also committed suicide by poisoning, and he himself fell into prison.</p>
<p>The original English name of this film is PAYMENT DEFERRED, so according to its plot, if it is translated as (Seeking wealth and bringing disaster), it is better to translate it as (Retribution is inevitable), which is more true to both the film title and the plot.</p>
<p>The director of this film was too rigidly guarding the story of the script, and could not let it go before collecting it, so he could not exert much brilliance. The background is almost completely concentrated in one family, and nine out of ten of the simple twists and turns are conveyed through dialogue. Therefore, in times of poverty, only the facial expressions and complaints of the couple and a daughter are shown. After becoming rich, there is no deep satirical portrayal of the snobbishness of society towards this dishonest rich man. The rich nephew, after arriving from Australia for the first time, induced him to do speculative business and borrow money from him the first time they met. It is too abrupt that he immediately poisoned him after the loan failed.</p>
<p>There are four or five actors in the whole film, and there are only three relatively important roles in the play. There is no outstanding talent, but the performance is not annoying.</p>
<h3>Review of (Lovelies)</h3>
<p>— Xing</p>
<p>British films, whose sales in the Chinese market have been stagnant for four or five years, have indeed been much more active recently. Perhaps British film merchants have seen their own shortcomings and the reasons for Hollywood's success, so they have recently tried to lean towards comedy. The Wanguo Company is the most hardworking one.</p>
<p>However, in any case, British comedy slapstick films are still mostly failures. Even with (Lovelies), which was screened at Carlton yesterday, it still cannot be considered good.</p>
<p>The story of this film is too long to tell, and it is a shadow with nothing. It is just two couples who want to get married, and the uncle of these two young men obstructs them in every possible way, resulting in many twists and turns. But in the end, these four lovers all became husband and wife.</p>
<p>The director is Lupino Lane, who is said to have become famous for playing the waiter in (The Merry Widow). His performance is good, but his directing is really not clever. The organization of the whole film is also very far-fetched. From beginning to end, it starts with a panoramic view of the bullring and ends with a hall full of children. This kind of writing may be considered rarely seen. Because these are all fashionable items from five or six years ago. Most of the middle ones are also outdated.</p>
<p>The actors are almost the entire cast of (Muddled Relatives) three weeks ago. The most important one is Stanley Lupino, who has a naturally funny face and his performance is not bad. The secondary one is his old partner Jack Hobbs, who has more than enough acting skills, but not enough color. The remaining five supporting roles make it impossible to evaluate their art. The little bit of laughter from the side attack also seems rigid.</p>
<h3>Tianyi Constructs Swimming Pool</h3>
<p>— Peiyuan</p>
<p>In addition to the club facilities, Tianyi Company also has complete sports equipment. Recently, the weather has gradually turned hot, and summer is approaching. We know that the best sport in summer is swimming. Therefore, every summer, public swimming pools are frequented by ladies and gentlemen. Seeing this, Shao Zuiweng, the owner of Tianyi Company, recently converted the original small pond in front of the company's photography field into a small-scale swimming pool, and planted various trees and flowers around it. Construction began yesterday afternoon, and all the company's employees were mobilized. Ms. Chen Yumei also worked with the public, hoeing the ground. Shao Zuiweng supervised from the side. It is expected to be completed in two or three months. I think this trend will start, and other companies may follow suit.</p>
<p>The photography is ordinary and lacks aesthetic appeal. The lighting is barely above average. The scene division is generally okay, but the shortcomings of the photography cannot be remedied by editing in a dark room. Cross-cutting is the soul of slapstick comedies, but here, cross-cutting is the play itself. The play is entirely composed of several cross-cuts, so it's hard to call it good. There is a lot of dialogue, but countless lines are laughable, and the slight insertion of Spanish and French adds a unique charm. Unfortunately, apart from the facial expressions during the speech, the humor in the dialogue is not welcomed by Chinese audiences. The pronunciation is okay. As for all the irrationalities in this film, I won't go into detail.</p>
<p>In addition, there are two supporting films that I must mention. They are (technical short films), which can also be considered science films. From the creation of the airplane model by Europeans in 1831 to the latest land and sea airplanes in 1932, the reforms and evolution of airplanes over the past century, although roughly, are unprecedented. From these short two thousand feet of film, one can see how much effort Europeans and Americans have put into aviation research. The call for aviation to save the country is surging. In China, which is in national crisis, these two supporting films, which are of great interest and stimulating, are worth watching.</p>
<h3>Advice to Film Critics</h3>
<p>— Shaogu</p>
<p>Many film critics, due to their enthusiasm for protecting domestic films, sometimes have excessive expectations. They always nitpick at a relatively meaningful film, attacking it relentlessly. They never think that the history of these film companies is not very long, and their finances are not very abundant. As for the screenwriters and directors, they are not famous writers, so of course, they will have some immature flaws. Moreover, some critics' views are not necessarily very accurate.</p>
<p>In short, the fact that film companies in recent times can resolutely abandon all boring and low-taste works and engage in more progressive and meaningful works is worthy of our audience's admiration. Finally, I especially hope that film critics will not protect the products of one company and wantonly slander the productions of another. Please abandon the political tactics of factionalism and be a loyal comrade of domestic films.</p>
<h3>A Gathering of Stars in ("Powder Market")</h3>
<p>— Baiwen</p>
<p>Recently, Hollywood films often bring together many famous stars and use a better script to attract audiences. This method can certainly achieve great results. For example, MGM's ("Grand Hotel") and Fox's ("State Fair"), which was recently released in this city, were both sensational films.</p>
<p>Star Film Company recently produced a sound film ("Powder Market"), which adopted the above method of attracting audiences. It is said that the screenwriter is Ding Qianping, who wrote ("Raging Torrent"). The theme is about women's employment issues, set against the backdrop of a department store. Because the story consciousness of the script is very good, the company wants to use this to create a sensation. The director is Zhang Shichuan, and the actors who have been confirmed are especially talented, almost all of whom are stars who usually star alone. It is worth introducing here: Hu Die, Hu Ping, Wen Xia, Yan Yuexian, Gong Jianong, Wang Xianzai, Sun Min, and so on.</p>
<p>Looking at the list of these actors, we can imagine that the appeal of ("Powder Market") will probably not be small, right?</p>

<h3>Film Novel Cavalcade (6)</h3>
<p>— Ne</p>
<p>Time flies, Edward is already an adult, and Joey has also entered Eton College. At that time, a love song called "Beside the Seaside" was popular throughout England. Edward and Edith were in the process of youthful love, and this love song seemed to be sung for them, so Quinn's mind did not feel the vulgarity of the lyrics, but felt its beauty. One day, Joey walked with his mother on the beach, and met Fanny again. She was growing up like a lotus emerging from the water, with charming smiles, red hair, blue eyes like the sea, and a body that had developed and was full of vitality. Joey stared with big eyes, as if he couldn't get enough of looking at her. When Quinn saw Fanny, she regained her old mood, as if Allen had not left her, and she felt that she could not say thousands of words for a while.</p>
<p>At this time, Edward and Edith, a pair of lovers, were sitting on an overturned wreck on the beach (this is foreshadowing), chatting and teasing. Suddenly, Edith saw a large steamer in the distance. She pointed to the boat and said to Edward, (I really want to go to that boat to play, would you like to?) Edward's heart was pounding very hard, and he said: (Together?) At this time, Edward was deeply immersed in love, but this was the 20th century, and one had to pretend to be casual when talking about love; and Edith's heart was pounding even harder, and she also pretended to be casual. She said: (I'm afraid so.) Edward took this step and spoke about love, mentioning taking that big ship to go on a honeymoon. The two leaned closer and closer until they embraced, kissed, and made their vows, all in the blink of an eye, fulfilling their long-cherished dreams.</p>
<p>After Edward and Edith got engaged, they followed each other day and night, and thought about each other day and night. But soon they got married, boarded that big ship, which was its maiden voyage, and went to America together for their honeymoon. They were so happy to the extreme, but fear arose from love, and they began to doubt, especially Edith, who was always afraid that Edward would leave her one day, or that one day she would call him and he would not answer. At this time, they were sitting on the deck, her head on Edward's shoulder, holding hands. The more she thought about it, the more afraid she became. She thought (this beautiful scenery and good time are great, but how long will the joy last? Colorful clouds easily dissipate, and the moon wanes after being full, and most things in the world are like that). Thinking of this, she couldn't help but say something very strange, she said: (Suppose a ghost came to us now and said (You have to count the fish in the Atlantic Ocean clearly; otherwise, you will die tonight.) What then?)</p>
<p>(Then we'll die!) Edward laughed at her, but Edith couldn't return his smile. She only asked one question: (Death, are you afraid?) Edward said: (I don't know, I'm afraid I'll be afraid at that time.) Edith said: (I'm not afraid. Think about it, this moment is the happiest moment in our lives. Death is not the most terrible thing. It would be terrible if you weren't with me in the future.)</p>
