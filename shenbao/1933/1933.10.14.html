<h3>日僞繼續破壞工作</h3>
<p>伯力此間所接中東路報告謂日滿當局持續之侵略行爲、復激起新鮮事變彼等正努力撲滅中東路蘇員之全部［滿］國駐滿洲里站之警察、繼續其破壞鐵路正常工作之努力、於十月十日毫無理由拘捕機車貯藏所主任萊維茨基、且用武裝　士解赴博克　站、博克圖站之警察復將該段副段長蘇員吉里洛夫逮捕、警士原欲賴此等行動、以澈底消滅中東路蘇聯負責人員、同時將該路段之行政及彼等之職權移入滿洲代表手中、中東滿方副局長張鳴歧曾撤消蘇方副局長托耳司托夫、委任萊維茨基爲機車貯藏所主任之命令、而另委滿員接充該路局長羅帝在答覆此舉時、即將滿方副局長之命令撤消並向中東路理事會報告聲明張嗚歧之非法行動乃破壞職員之紀律、同時阻難鐵路之工作、並建議該會應採取適當步驟、以制止此項行爲羅氏同時請求理事會設法保護鐵路業務、令不受警察之干涉並應保障經常之工作情况云、（十二日塔斯電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）　倫敦各報今日雖未載有批評中東路爭案之讑文、但皆於顯著地位載有關於此事之電文、凡與遠東有關者、對此事變、均深切注意、有謂蘇俄責日本故意鼓動中東路沿線匪患、以期破壞該路、要知此種責言、自六月二十六日出售該路談判開始以來、已屢見不鮮、且俄國至今尙未將日本指其盜去之火車交還該路云、此間人士踓罕有以爲日本將與蘇俄斷絶外交關係者但衆覺此次爭端或將促成日本純粹之陸海軍人内閣、說者謂日本近今對華態度、已見和緩即因日本鑒於日俄之爭執、故不欲爲中國事件所牽掣、而近來海參崴蘇俄陸海活動消息亦爲日本所注意者也（十三日路透電）</p>
<h3>日關東軍編練蒙古騎兵　供對俄作戰用</h3>

<h3>日政府五相會議高橋已爲荒木屈服　犧牲財政計劃以擴充軍備　所謂日本國策亦大體决定</h3>
<p>（東京）　十六日之五相會議再開在即、政局頗爲緊張、高橋藏相　發表意見如下、五相會議雖以外交爲第一而進行談話然外交亦不能蔑視軍備之背景蓋以軍備爲保障和平所必要之意見、原則的均已一致、不過日本主張究須貫澈到何程度外國主張能承認至何程度此點尙未一致然會議當不致决裂明年度預算須以五相之結論爲基礎而編成之、若不能得到結論惟有分别審議預算（十三日電通社電）</p>
<h3>所謂日本國策大綱</h3>
<p>（東京）　五相會議開三次會議之結果、對於帝國國防外交大方針之根本槪念大體一致今後苟不發生特别之狀况、由第四次五相會議再審議整理之後、即可研究可具體實現之各方針、此五相會議與荒木陸相提唱之非常時國策有密切關係、預料陸相之非常時國策案内將成議題其國策大綱大體諒解如下、</p>
<p>（一）國防｛國防須預想最惡之場合、從速實施可以完全保守國土最少限度之凖備與計劃、最遲須於昭和十一年度完成、</p>
<p>（二）外交｛外交雖務必努力和緩、勿使與帝國以當面之威脅爲第一義、同時須變更從來之外交態度、對華外交不必連用技巧、以對援助中國反日態度方面之工作、爲對華外交之根幹、</p>
<p>（三）農村｛對於農村奬勵多産豐作、改正地租地方稅統制肥料價格改正金融統制等、努力整理負債、</p>
<p>（四）思想｛須根本改正教育制度、努力宣揚日本精神、除去社會惡化、拒絶惡思想之流入</p>
<p>（五）對滿策｛以使［滿洲國］成爲完全的理想的國家爲第一義、即産業開發亦不許違反此第一義惟産業開發須始終立脚於日滿統制經濟爲謀實現之故内地産業不能不有多少之犧牲此則須覺悟者、</p>
<p>（六）財政｛財政確立誠爲重要然當此非常之時欲謀財政計劃之確立、不獨事實上不可能且將留重大之禍根、而爲打開非常時之故、必要之最小限制之支出斷不能吝、如今日之支出是否於國家經濟有大害、殊爲疑問、（十三日電通電）</p>
<h3>一說維持非戰原則</h3>
<p>（東京）　五大亞會議十六日開第四次會議、然未能達　結論、未解决之問題遂不得、提交豫算閣議、因此會議今後之形勢頗不許樂觀、即試觀五大臣會議迄今成績、祗有日本與諸列强之間維持非戰的原則一項、意見一致、然關於此項非戰原則由外交軍事上考慮與各國個别的關係時、出於何種技術的政策問題、意見未見一致、即日本對中英·美·俄·及其他各國之外交及軍事政策·在平時與戰時應如何處置、外務省與軍事當局之主張不同、又外交軍事工作上基本所必要之日本國内社會·經濟·思想·農村等問題之徹底改革現狀、軍部對於政府各部之態度殊覺不滿、而行政當局亦非難軍部關於本問題意見、如斯五大臣會議意見一致者僅有採用非戰原則之一點、在其他外交綱之完成陸海軍之兵備改善範圍·造艦計劃之實行問題·及國内工作實施手段五大臣各有不同意見故其前途頗爲各方面注目（十三日日聯電）</p>
<h3>荒木以砲火救日本</h3>
<p>（東京）　日政府之五相會議、軍財兩閥仍在爭執中、雙方爭論甚激烈尙未得到結論荒木陸相今日下午赴三重縣臨行對日記者談云、會議内容還不能談到、軍部主張整頓軍備、應付一九三六年之危局目的在於擁護國土遂行國策、陸軍凖備對付俄國、海軍提防美國、但陸軍當局並未對俄美開戰、不過主張未雨綢繆而已、誰說要對美俄戰爭、日退出國聯之目的在於擁護［滿洲國］之獨立、維持遠東和平、因日政策不見諒於國聯、故與國聯决絶、退盟後未滿八個月當初之意氣何在、請看内外情勢何等險惡農村慘狀何等深刻、中小商工業如何慘淡工人如何過活、此種危急萬分之國情尙且看不到、還要說什麽非常時不非常時、國内多責軍部倒　逆施、軍部有什麽倒行逆施、看農村之慘狀再說、農村不能自、　農民找不出生路、日本固有精神終無從保存、救濟農村不能憑空說話、又不能單靠金錢、如政府當局不覺悟、我荒木自有决心又何必空談卸責、各閣員若能了解此内外危局國策自能决定、陸軍省之國防目標以俄國爲假想敵、此爲國防上之常識、並不足以爲珍奇、而且軍部毫無對美俄挑戰之意、不過美俄若不願諒解日本之國策、在必要時不辭一戰而已、（十三日華聯電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>報宫崎野田二君并告日本人士</h3>
<p>— 梓</p>
<p>吾人讀宫崎龍介君［獻中國民衆書。］方欲爲文以報。適經由東北平津來滬之日本國民同盟代表野田文一郎君。於前夕以其［告友邦人士書。］要求本報刋登。同時日本各通訊社亦譯送此稿。因述中國人民對中日問題之根本意見。并報一君。宫崎君爲孫中山先生故人宫崎滔天君之子。在日本政治派系中屬社會大衆黨。其欲中國民衆諒解者。爲與盎格魯撒克遜人對抗中之日本地位。野田君爲日本右翼政黨國民同盟之總務長。其所用以告中國人士之辭。純然顯示該同盟之本色。就東亞門羅主義與日滿聯合之出發點以立言也。吾人深慚未能抛却中國人民之地位。以接納二君之勸告。然二君旣費其心力作成正式書函以見貺。茲亦以誠懇之答覆。冀二君修正其錯誤之見解。并望轉達於同此見解錯誤之日本人士。</p>
<p>二君對於中國人之觀察。有一根本錯誤點。即未能看到中國國民性中堅忍不屈之優點是。中國近六百餘年來。失受異族之侵凌壓迫同時亦因長期與異族周旋。獲得若干反抗壓迫之經騐用此經騐。以助堅忍不屈之國民性。此最近中國民族運動所由起也。中國人近已充分明瞭。在今之世。一屈服於異族。必無翻身之日。中國人認識現代之帝國主義國家。斷非昔之元清可比。中國倘一錯失。將使其子孫萬世爲奴。故宫崎慮中國打倒日本將遭共管瓜分之禍純屬過慮。野田君欲以［世界爲家之寬宏胸襟］［人類爲友之博愛仁心］。勸中國人士忘其覆國之危。失地之痛。亦屬難能。中國人士今日明白認識其國家之出路。只有秉堅忍不屈之性。向侵略者鬭爭。此種堅忍不屈之鬭爭。非任何具有麻醉性之說辭所能使之弛緩。願日本明識之士勿視之。</p>
<p>宫崎君欲中國民衆諒解［謂日本一朝捲入世界大動亂之旋渦中。不得不使經濟自給自足。滿洲固不容言。即中國沿海。亦有歸入日本軍事的戰策圈内之必要。］野田君欲中國明白滿洲事變已過議論時代。欲中國有識者理解日本之誠意放棄排日態度與之訂立國防同盟。或經濟同盟此種說詞。若非吾人聽慣日本軍閥侵略主義之謬論者。聞之必爲駭倒。吾人對此。誠覺無言可以相報。惟願二君反躬自思。倘有一國家。以今日日本對待中國之手段對日本。而又以如此說詞勸誘日本。日本人士將如何乎。中國人除少數無恥漢奸以外。非盡愚癡。願二君及其他明識之日本人士。免費心力。犭更發如此之荒謬言論。</p>
<p>今吾人一述解决中日糾紛之意見。誠摰以報二君。</p>
<p>一·東北爲中國領土。中國有神聖之主權。倘日本翻然改圖。使中國得恢復其領土之完整者。中日人士乃有諒解合作之機。否則中國人斷不忘却失地之痛與覆國之危。</p>
<p>二·世界和平與東亞民族獨立。爲中國人士之願望。然其根基。在於世界最大國家東亞最大民族之中國。得享有完全自由獨立。如日本所揭　之亞洲門　主義。實非中國人所能承認。</p>
<p>三·城下之盟。中國人民。已引爲深恥。若欲更進一步。誘致中國人民之甘心爲奴。事屬萬不可能。野田君謂［上天註定兩國必須互結友好關係。倘有故違天意。淪亡之禍。即在眼前。］吾人欲反問此妨礙友好關係應受淪亡之屬。究爲何國。</p>
<h3>暹羅又起革命　軍隊起事圖復王權　盤谷郊外發生戰爭</h3>
<p>盤谷　暹羅現復發生革命、就現時種種徵象觀之、或將較一九三二年六月與本年六月間之革命更形嚴重、聞王族中之波伐拉台吉親王現正率軍向盤谷進發、交通現已紊亂漽滯、出入之新聞消息、均受嚴厲之檢查、政府已發表公報、申明擬戡平亂事、恢復秩序並慰告各外國署、决負外僑生命財産安全之責、按暹羅曾於十二個月内發生革命兩次、最近一次、乃在本年六月十五日、當時陸軍總司令波拉巴於哈大佐派兵扼守政府公署與王宫四週各要點、逮捕主要閣員、保守黨政府遂被迫辭職上年六月曾發生不未流血之革命暹王因以變易其獨君主地位爲立憲君主、（十三日路透電）</p>
<h3>暹京宣佈戒嚴</h3>
<p>盤谷叛兵兩大隊佔據距盤谷八哩之頓穆安飛行場、忠誠之軍隊刻正與之交戰此間已宣佈戒嚴令、日由各處調援固防京中現尙安謐、人民未露驚惶之象、（十二日路透電）</p>
<h3>叛軍佔飛機場</h3>
<p>（倫敦）　每日郵報盤谷通訊員今日電稱、暹京已宣告戒嚴因上游駐軍、起事企圖攻入京城、現與政府軍在京城之北八哩作戰、王家航空隊大本營之唐芒航空塲已爲叛軍佔據、暹京各　　署及外國銀行所在地均派軍保護、惟京内未起紛擾人民安堵暹王與后現方駐蹕海濱避署地之化寗、（十三日國民電）</p>
<h3>保王黨謀冉起</h3>
<p>（倫敦）　近數月來暹羅國内反對具有共産傾向之現政府者日衆、現信此次軍隊之起事、迨欲恢復王室權力、使居於眞正君主立憲地位、蓋自一九三二年六月第一次革命以來、國王大權旁落、即現任首相巴化爾亦僅因深得民望、被人擁戴爲傀儡政府實權、握於二十少年陸軍官與四五青年海軍官之手、在幕後指揮者、更有現居巴黎之普拉狄、此次反政府軍之領袖、聞爲反對若輩之另一派海軍官、具有决意掃除共産主義之主張云、（十二日國民電）</p>
<h3>軍縮僵局難打開　英美法不免對德决裂　意態度游移德更堅决　興登堡出席閣議運用權力</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）　英美法雖盡力欲避免在軍縮問題上與德國决裂、但氣象現甚黯淡聞英外相與美代表台維斯昨日會商時、德代表那杜尼前來聲稱渠將赴柏林、以便與其政府商榷、因其政府現較前更形堅决也云、今後各事將擊於今日之柏林内閣會議、興登堡總統之出席、將以其無可疑問之權力加諸内閣之决議、其結果或將由總理希特勒於對衆演說中宣佈之、原議在星期一日軍縮大會總委員會開會時提出一議案、追認巴黎恊定書中三點、即（一）不重置軍備（二）逐漸裁減軍備（三）在對德讓步以前管理德國軍備若干時是、但此議現已放棄、因見意國態度游移、而美國則堅持德國須遵守此計畫之見解未有妥恊之可能性也、衆料英外相西門將向總委員會說明談判之情形、並建議今後之手續、大約將指定法學家委員會、以覓取一種方案、（十三日路透電）</p>
<h3>德要求防守軍備</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）　現各國代表仍在繼續運用手腕、鈎心鬥角、以求打破軍縮僵局但希望則仍極渺小、且昨日德代表那度尼氏與英代表之談話、已明白證實、德國若不能獲得防守軍備之要求、則决不簽字於軍縮條約云、今晚那杜尼復與英代表西門會談一次、而西門氏事前亦曾與英代表台維斯氏相見、（十二日國民電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　關於軍縮會議之談話繼續進行、美國代表台維斯今晨曾與意大利代表蘇拉尼亞相晤、昨日夜深英外相西門及美代表台維斯均與德代表那多尼會晤、兩人又將法英美三國代表商定之態度重對那多尼說明、以上所述種種談話内容如何、外間不得而知惟聞那多尼似曾問台維斯、如德國國防改爲短期之徵兵制則將許其配備何笙種軍器台維斯似答稱、軍器仍以凡爾賽條約所允許者爲限、不加多亦不減少、（十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>監督軍備成癥結</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）　法·英·美已實際同意設置中立國際委員會試行監督軍備四年之提議刻正商擬决議案草稿、該案將官告德國在此四年之内、不得　備凡爾賽條約規定以外之武裝、德代表那度尼此時突然爲希特勒總理召回柏林、希氏特派飛機往巴塞爾迓那氏回京、那氏已往該地凖備明日清晨乘機出發、此舉頗有幾分神秘意味、（十二日國民電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　美國爲求對　妥恊起見已表示願將監督軍備試騐期縮短爲十八個月倘德國能接受此議、則冀望法國能贊同一理論的恊定、許德國得置與法國同樣防衛武器、但非俟試騐期滿德國不能實在置備、美國此種提議或能爲各方所接受、但日内瓦大多數觀察時事者、仍惴</p>
<p>惴於監督備計劃、倘不能早日商妥則軍縮會議將遭遇嚴重危機云、（十二日國民電）</p>
<h3>法堅持監軍四年</h3>

<p>延宕經月之灤東勦匪問題、自撫寗縣被匪陷落後、因而益形吃緊、股匪當時曾擬逞其淫威、繼續西竄、以是昌黎灤縣完全陷於充分恐怖狀態、記者頃親歷險境、實地採訪、特將耳聆目睹所得、詳述於後、藉餉關心灤東部題者、</p>
<h3>股匪之形成與撫寗被陷</h3>
<p>灤東股匪有無背景、自爲明眼人所洞見、不過該匪等之内容與其現在之實况、確爲外間所鮮知、按該匪之唯一首腦機關、厥爲東亞同盟聯合軍、匪軍軍部、即設於秦皇島、匪軍總指揮爲石友三之舊部戚文平、戚下尙有二軍第一軍軍長爲郭亞洲、第二軍軍長爲張魁元（即老耗子、）第一軍軍部設於榆關鎭、第二軍部設於抬頭營、各軍之下、則系統繁亂無法統計、有三五百人成一師司令部者、亦有百八十人成立旅司令部者、郭亞洲所領匪數在二午人左右、老耗子所屬亦不過三午餘人、且大權完全操於戚文平之手、外傳有謂老耗子已秘返魯、灤東之匪已無人統制行將瓦解之說純係揣度之詞殊不知老耗子之上尙有戚文平也所有匪衆有二來源、一爲口外驅入者、二在各地招募者、口外驅入者、均係千百之衆、彼等槍械齊全、匪性亦難馴、在各地招募者、多爲失業軍人、凡有匪夥之介紹、即可到秦皇島匪軍部領取槍一支、彈二百粒、一經登紀後便可以自由行動、至於搶奪姦淫聽其自便、如於搶掠發財後、可以二百元呈交匪軍部、其所領之槍彈、即可歸其自有現昌黎以東、如留守營、北戴河海濱·泰皇島·榆關鎭·抬頭營·撫</p>
<p>寗縣、均爲匪軍之散佈地、且在昌黎以東彼等乘坐火車槪不納票、洋洋若正式軍隊然、至匪軍之竄撫寗、初未料及彼等可以暢然直下、緣我保安第三大隊鎭守撫寗頗具厚力、即匪包圍近撫城後、保安隊尙環城扼守、靜待援隊、乃城内竟有漢好祖國勤（前僞縣長）等、企圖藉匪之力、再充縣長於是一方在城内散佈謠言、謂保安隊已退去致人心大慌、相繼自西門蜂擁逃出、縣長劉興沛、亦信以爲眞、竟率領所屬星夜逃奔昌黎、是時保安隊尙在前綫應戰突聞後方完全逃走、而後方傳訊機關、亦行斷阻、於是只有順勢西退、大好撫寗城、遂爲匪衆竄據、保安隊張總隊副、痛憤異常、歎前功盡棄、遽然發作神經病、每日痛哭流涕、吼號呻吟、慨奮萬狀、現已送至天津診治矣、</p>
<h3>空前之酷刦昌黎亦恐慌</h3>
<p>撫寗退出後、　好祖國勤、遂引匪入城、自以爲個人作官私慾、定可如願以償、孰料匪旣入城、彼之縣長尙未實現、而姦淫搶火焚屋城内商號被、搶一空、如是者達五日、匪衆無不腰纒纍纍、而匪首龍海廷白子全與某國浪人國宏亮一、（均老耗子之部下）竟發出安民佈告、人民初尙以爲可以謀得安生、誰知匪之零星搶掠雖漸减少、而　欵之勒索、接踵以來、且匪之勒索、毫無限制、此股索欵將繳、彼股相繼而至、人民旣無法應付、能脫逃者、固早已脫逃、不能脫逃者、只有自殺、免受蹂躙、至十月初祖國勤始行就任、並委出大批餘黨、接收縣屬各機關、彼等自以爲有功於匪衆、於就任後、即派人將眷屬自秦皇島接回撫寗、乃該眷屬甫抵城門、即被匪衆扣留强姦、因果之報、立時實現、撫寗旣陷、留守營亦被匪竄據、於是昌黎遂變成股匪西竄之第一道線、人鑒於因匪衆慘刦撫寗無不異常恐慌、紛紛西逃、各商號均休市、學校紛紛停課、各機關亦停止工作、幸河北省保安總隊部設於此、總隊長　希哲、早在城郊設有嚴密防備、故昌黎幸保無恙、</p>

<p>美國絲織業、在　戰時期、突飛猛進、一　而爲世界銷用生絲最巨之國家、占全世界産量百分之六十、一九二九年前、各織廠競製出品、早有供過於求之現象、迫一力二九年以後絲織品堆積市塲、加之人民購買力薄、因是供過於求之現象益著、絲織品之價値益低、絲業乃大受打舉但不久即逐漸恢復、近數年來絲織廠之變遷鎰多、但全羣銷用生絲額、仍在五十五萬包以上、最近因政府實施復興運動後、商店因恐物價猛漲、爭相定貨、以故六七兩月、各廠更形活動、一若一九二九年之繁榮、惜商店多定貨品後、能否銷售尚無把握、近兩月來、絲價驟跌、九月份銷用生絲僅三萬五千包、而存絲多至七萬五千包、不可謂非六七兩月勃興之反響也、人造絲侵略生絲業、日甚一日、美國各綢廠十分之七之原料爲人造絲、惟　廠尙徼倖保存、人造絲在美之成功、初因推銷官傳之得法、繼因人民經濟竭騷、無力　買眞絲織品、其推銷方法、由團體代同業設計、以人造絲織品製成衣服、陳列公共塲所、引起仕女之興趣、製造廠家出售貨物後復派技術人員前往指導、故近兩年來各綢廠樂於採用、自各國人民　買力减少後、婦女但求衣服美麗、價格低廉、不問其原料爲眞絲仰或人造絲、廠家但求出品易銷、有利可圖、卽不問其織品之原料爲眞絲、抑成人造絲、且採用人造絲、技術上較用天然絲爲容易、但人絲造變略不僅絲業一項、卽棉毛織業亦同受影響、然天然眞絲、自有不可模仿之特點、非人造絲可得完全替代也、</p>
<h3>華絲美銷失敗原因</h3>
<p>華絲美銷、向假外人之手、數年的雖有經營生絲之華商數家、但均籌人在海外直接推銷僅委託外人代表銷售、而銷售是否得力、購買者之經　能力是否可　、無從探悉、一經打擊遂相率停業今　然獨立者、惟通運一家耳銷售華絲假手普通進口商、不特美國絲織業之進步及需要不能明悉、卽推銷亦復不力、　如某廠　進口商或　客購買華絲若干担、往往此種進口商或掮客不加搜集、卽舉日絲以代、以求交易之成近來推銷生絲、已成爲一種專門服務、不可以銷售其他普通商品同一視之也茲舉一例、麻省某廠數年前購得華絲一担、試用後品質不合夫能購用、數年内一聞華絲、卽疾首痛心、近　我國某絲廠派員前往推銷後、已完全改用華絲、推銷生絲須先察其需要、對於品質、尤須使購買者有深切之信任、然後舉以求　、再以源源不絶之貨物、供其應用、</p>
<h3>須備現貨保存均匀</h3>
<p>美國絲業自受打擊後、一戢廠家經　能力非常簿弱不能訂購期貨、且自政府厲行復興政策後、　織業之變化無定是以配置原料不能預定期貨、銷路不如往年之多、而日絲則存積市上、隨時可以購得、卽期貨不合時亦得隨時掉換、然如華絲不合時、除割價掉換外、無法解决也、價格一層、均好審、售價太高、襪廠　而生長低次者美國市塲、　又不能與同級日絲得相等價格品質以直繅爲最不合用之要點次之爲均匀華絲以品分微細、目女　　於注意條公均匀、此層會望改良籌絲者特别注意萬勿因减低成本、而採用絲分組巨之品、失去華絲之特質、</p>

<h3>華絲前途補救方法</h3>
<p>羅絲業連年失敗、業中人大都　累維持尙覺不易、遑論改良、業外人視爲畏途亻欲投資、是以就絲業本身而言、改良層非常困難去年已經政府救濟勉强將陳絲銷售、渡此難　、今年春繭繭本在八百元以上、而目前美國絲價僅合六百五十元、相差百餘元、以致銷路　滯、一般絲廠又將陷於危境挽救之方、自應就蠶桑製絲貿易二方面同時並進、蠶桑製絲已由中央地方委籌辦法、積極進行、貿易項、鄙見所及、應由政府商人合資設立直接推銷機關、裝運現貨、向國外絲織廠家直接銷售以廣銷路、蘇解積困云云、</p>

<p>無線電週刊新發明的鞋鈕眞空管  　　現在的眞空管上下　　收受五公尺以下的　　雖尙合用，惟在超　　(Ｕjtra　Shqrt　Wa　)一公尺以内之波長，則因其有較大的極間　　量與白感量，甚不適宜，故曾有白克哈生　　式振　器（Ｂaekhausenkurt2　Typo　Oscillator)以應用於播送及接收短波之超回授　或在超外差式檢波器的機上，惟就實用而言，此器收音旣不靈敏，缺少選擇性，又　不穏定之弊，且多耗電力，缺點尚多。　　因此美國亞爾西　電子管公司（Ｒ，Ｃ·Ａ·Ｒadistron　Co)試騐室工程師湯姆生（B·J·　Tbompson）與羅司（G·M·Ｒoso)埋首研究，擬改良短波的收受方法，乃發見最小眞空管。此管較普通眞空管約小十倍，全長僅四分之三　寸，與鞋鈕大小相若，因名之曰鞋鈕眞空管。此管雖小，其特性與普通大者同，惟其極　電容量與則小至十倍。　　此眞空管可用於一公尺或史以内的超短波收音機上，在特殊線路内，亦可用於長波，此管因體積過小輸出電力低弱不能適用於播送　上。但試騐家有此發見，不可不謂能人的成績，惟超短波尙未至實用時期，故各眞空管製造廠家目下尙未有製造此管之企圖。天綫的指向性  勁　　凡是用地（Ｇround)地網(Ccunterpoise)的天線，普通稱爲馬可尼(Marconi)式。這天線共有三部（一）呈架空天線，（二）呈地線，（三）是天地線的引入線。這　天線大槪適用於一百公尺以上的長波。建立繁複。因爲裝置的不同，常用的有下　各式各式天線與其指向性曲線　第一圖（４）　Ｖ式　（４）　Ｖ式（３）　Ｔ式　（３）　Ｔ式（２）　Ｔ式　（２）　Ｔ式（１）直立式　（１）直立式　　其餘還有籠式，傘式，扇式等··無非是用許多道線佈置用籠，傘，或扇的形狀而得名，普通都用在發射時的。我們普通以爲天線對各方面發射和接收都一樣的，但是實際上有些天線對某方面的收發特别好，而對某方面特别壞，這就是所謂天線的指向性（Ｄireclional)了。第一圖各式天線的指向性，可由下圖見到下圖都是鳥瞰　天線收或發所得的情形。那些曲線表示天線向地仐各方面收發的狀况。Ｇ是天線的接地處。由圖可知直立天線，向四週收發能力完全相同，所以直立天線没有指向性。但那厂式天線就不同了；那曲線圖在Ｇ端的大些，表示這式天線向通地端這方向發較大能力，在不通地端較次，而對那和架空天線垂直的方向，收發能力更弱了；因　這　厂，天線有着顯著的指向性。那（３）圖所示的Ｔ式的天線，　有着指向性，牠是由二個厂式接成的情形。同理（４）圖的Ｖ式是將二個厂式列成角度的結果吧了。（未完）一種特殊原綫路圖  石華玉　　這是一只地位重最都很經濟的收音線路。屏極電壓祇用到十二個弗打左右，線路的接法也很特殊，因爲Ｂ電正極是通地線的。燈絲同路也與普通收音機不同，是與地線絶緣的。如果裝置良好，可以得到很好的効果，同時也增加了不少的靈敏性。控制再生力的是電阻　　　　Ｒ１　　　　Ａ＋，３２　　　　　　　Ａ－　　　　　　　Ｒ２Ｃ３　Ｃ２　　　　　Ｂ＋１２ＶＣ１Ｒ１，我們如果調節Ｒ１到穏定的嘯　剛剛發生的一點時，那未効力就開始了　。Ｌ是普通短波插入式線圈，但是不用再生圈。Ｃ１大約三十到五十mmt。Ｃ２要　·ＯＯＯ一五mf。Ｃ３是ＣＯＯ二五mt。Ｒ１照所用眞空管而定。這裏用３２，那末Ｒ１要用一隻三十歐姆的電阻。Ｒ２是普通高阻力電阻大約四個Ｍegobm的樣。這種式子呌Negadyne。電力電容器之修理與改造（續）  官質冰　　（二）修理時應注意之點：一·在電容器的蠟紙之外端，伸出出錫箔之剩餘部份剪下一方，以足塡補燒毀之蠟紙爲度，不可多剪，以致短於錫箔　　二·將剪下的蠟紙剪成小方，大小適能塡補一層蠟紙之破處爲度。而用膠水以次粘貼於破處，傪膠水　乾，後中如法重捲之。　　（三）重捲時應注意之點：一·須用少許膠汁，施於各層蠟紙上·以妨鬆動。　　二·重捲時須注重兩邊之蠟紙是否完全隔絶兩層錫箔，即一、沙一粒之小缺。亦須補好。　　三·裝製電容器之兩接線時，須用、趕錫焊　，但須注意損壞蠟紙或因過熱而燒毀邊緣。　　以下再說改造：我們旣已知電容器的構造，我們儘可自已去製造，不過因爲原料不易配備，所以做起來也非易事，現在我們有了已壞的電容器，我們利用這廢棄的東西來改造是比較容易，茲將改造的方法錄後：　　如果已壞的電容器的容最是一個買克羅法拉特（ＭＦ），而你所需要的爲半個買克羅琺拉特。你可將已壞的電容器展開來分作兩段或者分作兩條，頂好是能避過這已壞的部分，由此可以類推，任憑需用幾何容量均可改造，但不能改造比從前更大的容量。其捲復法如前，如果作小型的電容器時，最好是蠟紙比錫箔稍寬三四分，即每邊須寬一二分，其電容器的兩端接線頭，在兩錫箔上各貼用一小片軟銅皮，外面用紙裏好，（捲屈形式主扁圓均可）再塗上膠　水　或漆或蠟便可成功了。（完）小經騐简易蒸溜水滴取法  李元慶　　蓄電池久用，内部電液漸見減少，就應添加蒸溜水，這在鄉間不易辦到。可用大口玻瓶一個倒套在水壼的口頸上。蒸氣掁壼口發出後，經過玻瓶，因玻瓶面積較大，與外界冷空氣接觸處甚多，所以蒸氣便能凝成水滴。以杯承之，即可一用矣。常識（十六）礦石收音機（二）  黄鑑村　　（三）礦石檢波電路：使用礦石之檢波電路有單電路式與複電路式之兩種。此兩　電　之靈敏度均不甚差異，然於選性當以複電路爲　，故欲屏除雜音，當用複電路爲佳。（a)圖爲僅用一綫圈之司配諧之方式，在此情形，綫圈轉數之多寡應以天線之大小爲轉移。凡諧振線路，自感量之外，並須有電容量，在（a）圖之情形，係利用天線之電容量者。　　一·單電路礦石收音機：單電路之配諧以調節線圈之轉數面得。可在天線綫圈裝數綫頭（laP)，使能自由調節。如波長愈長，則線圈之轉數須愈增，此爲單電路之缺點。是以對於較長之波長，可採用（b）圖之電路，在此電路内，多用一變量電容器並聯連接於線圈。　　二·複電路礦石收音機：如（Ｃ）圖所示者爲複電路，其</p>
<p>天線電路與配諧電路各　開相當距離，故其選擇性較優。　　（四）礦石收音機之收聽距離：欲知礦石收音機之收聽距離，須先明電波之發射强度，大抵電波之發射强度隨定列所舉各條而變：（一）播音臺發射電力之大小，（二）播音臺與收音地點間之距離，（三）地勢等。例如播音臺與收音地點間有海時，較之陸地，電波更易達到。且在同一陸地，平坦之地，則較隔有山岳之地易於接收。故礦石收音機之收聽距離，如電波之强度爲一定時，應隨基勢而異。通常在平坦區域，礦石機之收聽距離可達六十　。但中央廣播臺之電力達七十五啓羅瓦特。因其電力强大，故在上海用礦石機亦常可聽得該電臺之播音</p>

<p>春秋銀幣  烟橋　　銀幣都稱銀圓，爲了形圓；圓變爲元，不行道什麽來由？社會上口頭稱呼，又作洋錢，大約爲了墨西哥的臚幣，首先到中國來，這和稱一切舶來品爲洋貨，是同一意義的。但，光緒年間，中國己經自鑄，爲什麽還要　他龍洋呢？尤其不可解的是稱臚幣爲英洋，墨西哥何曾隸　過英吉利呢？童時臚幣換龍幣，可以多幾個錢，後來價値相等了，現在應幣難得見面了，這也算得國貨抵抗洋貨，占了一點小勝利麽？　　我在劉公　先生那裏，見過一個咸豐年間上海某銀號鑄的銀幣·形式分量都和臚幣一般無二，不過全是中國字，没有什麽花紋的。　　民三大鑄銀幣，上面繪着遠世凱的像，北方人就稱他袁頭，袁頭的流通，比别的銀幣廣得多，窮鄉僻壤都信用他。甚至日本人以金融侵略，爲占據東三省以後的唯一政策，也讓東三省人用袁頭。這是去年的話，不知道現在怎樣？　　帆船，海鳥，太陽的圖案的銀幣，已成了新骨董。市上流行了只有帆船的新銀幣，這是中國抗日的一個小　故。不知道將來社會上，又要題一個什麽特别名詞，像袁頭之類。　　今年是國貨年，作貿易媒介的銀幣，也得矯正他的名稱，用國貨的稱呼，稱他「銀圓」也好，稱他「花邊」也好，稱他「銀餅」也好。請雅人不要稱他番佛」；請俗人不要丹稱他「洋錢」！　　記得有一副對，「古今三更生，中壘，北江，南海。宇宙一長物，孔兄，法郎，墨哥。」孔兄早歸淘汰，法郎墨哥不是國貨，可以改成「蟠龍，嘉禾，帆船」。吃秋天飯的人  石郎　　在城隍廟，在彎僻的馬路角裏，我們可見到不少這　人。他們有很多貨物，這些貨物都是活鮮鮮的生命，而這些生命都是跟着秋來出現，跟着秋去死亡的。那些人靠着這些生命的販賣得錢，吃飯，就等於靠着秋天吃飯一樣，所以我寫下這個奇怪的題目。　　一個担子，担子上滿是小紙盒，每個紙盒裏躱着，對秋虫，一雌一雄；種類非常多，據我所認識的就有好幾種，如金鐘兒，節鈴，草鈴，石鈴，竹鈴，默鈴，馬鈴，以及姐兒之類。他們都具着一副小巧，蒼翠，有趣的好身格，都來得一口好歌唱；只要一看担子旁圍着的一大堆凝神諦聽的人羣，便可知道他們是如何引人的東西了。假如是有閒階級，或者　得點小品趣味的人，就誰都不捨得不去買上一兩對玩玩。普通一點的（節铃，默鈴等）四五個銅板就可買一對，比較鮮見的（馬鈴，竹鈴等）就非一毛二毛小洋不可。如果買了一對，嫌他那紙盒不美觀，那他就可由你選買另一種精巧的玻璃盒子，但這就要討得很大的價錢。　　顧客是很多的，其中也有小孩子。但小孩大都只買便宜的節鈴子。那些馬鈴咧，姐兒咧，就專等那些在城隍廟吃碗茶的士紳階級去買的。雖然是三個四個欇極瑣碎的收入，却也足夠一家人整天的温飽。但是這收入是暫時的；一到秋天完結，天氣寒冷起來，這些小生命都得凍死，他們就得做别種行業去了。我亦和尙過來人  顔　　上月終，春秋刋我家征鴻之正始中學拾雋一文，我讀到該校學生盡是光頭，牛山濯濯，作和尙樣，不覺想到我亦和尙過來人，足自稱一聲老僧。而正始學生新出家，還是個小沙彌哩。　　距今十五年之前，我　旣不出學　有白飯吃的江蘇省立第三師範　　，那時校長是梁　顧述之先行他以爲師範生應　樸實無華，以樸實無華的精神來訓練我們　他自已也是能夠樸實無華之一以身作則者，那時我們都是十七八廿二三的小　子，人人愛俏，幾根頭髮，自然要修整和光光潔潔，並作種種式樣，我們的校長見了這許多光怪陸離之頭，陡的氣斷了肚腸，立下手諭，着於三天内一律剪光，但究不是生意經，我們得此命令，個個感到大禍臨頭，欲抱頭痛哭而不敢，三日之限甚促，當此千鈞一髮之際，自修室中都在分頭開護髮會議，可是大家籌不出一個好法，而爲免除想不出好法的煩惱計，終於一律遵命辦理，把數不清的煩惱絲，盡付并州一剪，旣剪之後，有的抱頭痛惜，有的顧影而笑；將奈何！也有的說：秃童矣，吾老矣，將奈何！也有的說··秃頭和尙矣，吾將看破紅塵，暮鼓晨鐘以終吾年矣，一時說說笑笑，倒也有趣，並且大家如此，早夕看慣，也不覺難看了，校長先生又長期聘個理髮的在校，爲我們軋髮駰一軋之時十　分鐘，一軋之費十多個銅圓，　省時，又省費，我們第三師範的和尙頭，馳名無錫全城，　外出，少見多怪的人，都見了我們在背後說：這是師範生！不但聞名無錫，江蘇各省立學校也莫不知道我們是和尚頭，記得某次在吳門開省校運動會，我們到場，「看第三師範的和尙」，這個聲音起於四週，還報我們以不斷的笑聲，他們以見和尙爲可笑，然我們則以做慣和尙，且早自認和尙，所以聞其言笑，毫無動於中，　　我這過來和尙，把過來情形報告完了，最後我向我們的同志正始小沙彌合十，祝你們做一日和尙撞一日鐘，跟了你的老和尙進行亦步亦趨，母怠母荒，不可偷吃肉，經却要念得熟。看古畫  符一葉　　連朝的秋雨把我禁在一家幽僻的小樓上不能出門，整天只翻Ｖ·Ｍ·Ｆriche的藝術社會學，覺得厭懶時便抽出浮生六記來每天讀一節，換換口胃，這樣，才把我焦躁的心緒靜定下來。　　今天，天是晴了。小别的陽光暖洋洋地映入窗口，日來堆積在心頭的挹鬰，也頓時溶散無踪，我獨自地提着水彩畫箱到法國去想在那兒畫幾幅秋雨後的小景，走到華龍路上，國畫展覽會的白布　子在風中招展，他吸住着我步武，我想想先看了畫才去作畫。　　雖然是狹小而微暗的塲所，但這兒却藏着不少的名畫，這在我是意外的奇遇，我流覽着八大山人的石鳥，墨荷，沈石田的菜，徐靑藤的鷄冠花，再看董其昌新羅山入唐六如，袁香亭的出水和鄭板橋的墨蘭，張船山的麃，這些從前只從板本上看見的名畫，現在一幀一幅都活現在我的眼前，數量上固然不多，可在我是稍感滿足而認爲僥倖了。　　並且，我對這些古畫别有一種憧憬，在八大山人不同凡俗的章法上，慢慢地想到逃避現實的人物，那種狂放不　的生活和空曠磊落的襟懷是如何忠實地寄在他的藝術内，唐六如之風流倜儻也自有其清麗秀逸的風格，而唱道情的　橋和咏無題詩的袁樹，前者之　湖氣槪，後者之浪漫諦克表現在詩境畫意中是怎樣清楚，張船　的畫自然不見得很好，可我又記　他的情調悲凉音節凄楚的，「春　雜感」，「哭妺」之等詩篇，啊，看古人的畫詩人的畫竟湧起許多美妙的想像和迴憶來。東北四連長  張恨水　　同時，煤舖子裏，油鹽舖子裏，也來討欠賬，各方面都得廳付，那裏有一刻閑。而自已心裏，老是那樣想着，這要一回家去說明白了，自已父親，首先要心裏不好過，桂枝呢，也許不是難受，簡直是一種懊悔，他本來想得很明白，不嫁軍人的了，結果還是嫁了軍人。嫁了軍人以後，怎麽樣呢？第一件事，就是嘗那離别之苦的滋味了。想到了這種地方，什麽事情，也不能安心去做，只是背了兩手，在樓下院子裏，不斷的徘徊着。他心裏極是不好受，倒給予了另一個魏排長，很好的機會，他走了過來，向趙自强行着禮道：連長，我有點事請，求　。趙自强道：嗐丨錢還没有發下來呢。魏排長道：錢都可以放在第二層，我這時想和連長求求情，回家去一趟。我家就在海甸街上，來回快得很的。趙自强皺了眉毛道：你的家在海甸，我的家不　是在海甸嗎？魏排長覺得這是很硬的一個釘，以下的話，不必等他說出來，也就可以知道了。行着一個禮退去，並不再說什麽。趙自强站着一想，馬上也許就要打仗了。那裏不望貼心的弟兄在一邊帮忙。在這個時候，爲一點小事得罪了排長，似乎也不是算盤。寗可自已多受一點累，也犯不上把一個切身的排長和罪了，於是親自跑了來，指望把自已願意他回家的話來告訴他。可是他手下的班長說：排長已經請着假走了。趙自强算是暗中碰了排長一個釘子，這話也無須對别人去說，只好放在心裏。可是一連人裏面，走了兩個排長，越發的走不開了。他心裏自然十分的忿恨着，不過在這個時候，又絶對的不能得罪人，只好紅着臉，將脚步放得重重的，走進自已的屋子裏去。這個時候，西苑大營裏，全營都混亂起來。最忙的自然要算是電話，其次便是傳令兵小夫子，前後亂跑。（二一二）</p>

<p>自由談處女與登龍  傖　　據說登龍原有乘龍之義，那末，乘龍的對方面如果没有處女，這登龍也就成爲没巴鼻的事了。因此，處女應該是登龍的唯一的對象。　　但龍門似海，文士如林，抛綵球旣已成了陳腐的勾當，究竟誰該登誰不該登？這就要看文士的手段了。在書店老板的龍門之下，遴選快婿當然是以　輯先生手段的高妙爲條件；而編輯先生的任務，主要的是拉攏讀者；拉攏讀者最得意的文章，自然是「提拔處女作」。　　作者大抵要自命爲先進，並、且很願意擠入老作家之林，在中國，在自已的文章上署上「處女作」字樣的便不多。那末，怎麽辦呢？但「登龍自有妙術」，只要找幾位名字不大順眼的投稿者，在他頭上按下一個「處女作」就完了。登載已經是「額外施恩」，更何况「稿費從豐」！難道他敢下說一句「謝謝您，大少」嗎？　　但也有自愛的作者却抗議這個。有一位被派爲「處女」的作者對我說，他一嚮作文的目的原是想以藝術來克服人性中的弱點，藉以建立階級道德心理的基礎，稿費他倒不在乎的。他的作品雖不能自承爲成熟，但次非「破題兒第一遭」。他過去爲了搪塞肚皮，也曾在文壇上賣過淫，終以登龍無術，就只好改行。不幸今年剛彈了一曲舊調，又被派爲處女：處女在人心目中雖極珍奇，但他慚愧的是身段　矮，眼睛究竟是大了。如果爲了東家招徠主顧的關係，再去扭扭揑揑喬裝處女的時候，那對於自已總是件傷心的事。　　因爲對於這位作者太親切了，我只好寬慰他說：「處女」在無論那種意味上都不是壞的名詞，只要看文學史上留下了一些「處女作」便可以知道。如果我們對於那些「非處女的大家」太過於絶望的時候，將希望放在未來方面倒是極對的丨雖然在編輯先生的動機中，是絶對不同的一回事。談魚塞漏舟  何如　　予嘗讀清儒陸隴其三魚堂文集，而謂陸氏自詡爲醇儒，實則腐儒之尤。蓋儒者無他技，惟日孜孜於天理人欲之辨，程朱陸王之爭，甚至拘拘於功過格，陰隲文，感應篇諸事，雖不謂之腐儒，不可得也。考陸氏以三魚堂名其集，是亦有說。陸溥嘗爲豐城縣丞。督運，夜過采石。舟漏，跪祝曰，舟中一錢非法，願葬魚腹，漏忽止。旦視之，則水　裏三魚塞其罅。溥爲隴其之曾祖，以三魚名其堂，所以志奇蹟也。隴其以三魚堂名其集，所以述祖德也。清官得天之祐，以魚塞其漏舟，非惑於陰隲感應之說，而謂果有其事乎？自漢儒董仲舒倡天人感應之說以來，腐儒實多，固不必爲陸氏咎也。　者予因不信道學家之神道謬說，乃並其魚塞漏舟之事，亦以爲虚妄矣。　　頃見報載三日路透廣州通訊，粵滬航線，中國三星（譯音）商船，載貨二百噸，前來廣州。過魚珠（譯音）砲台時觸礁艙底洞穿，水湧入甚速，船將下沈，船員亟抽水圖救急，但水忽不入，船仍浮起，繼續前進，船員異之。迨抵省後，起卸艙底，則見橫阻洞口者，有一大魚，衆始恍然，全船生命得以保全者，實賴此魚塞洞之力。魚爲銀鯉，重三十五磅，取至岸上時，魚已死。船員感其功，爲之舉行葬禮，並立碑以誌之。此訊果確，則魚塞漏舟，奇事有偶，殆因舟漏入水，魚隨水急入，適塞其罅，顧亦未可傅會陰隲感應等荒唐之說也。讀房龍地理雜感之一  余揚雲　　今年的出版界，提供了幾部好書，「房龍的地理，」便是其一。大槪是因爲可供學校採作教本，銷路比較有把握罷，這一部卷帙並不小的書，竟有三家書舖，同時印行譯本。我所讀的是新生命書局本，改名爲「我們的世界」，傅東華譯的。房龍的史地著作，　當於文藝意味；傅譯又着们傳達，因此我讀的時候，倒是當作小說的。　　這書的五四六頁上，有這樣一篇話：：　　一如果當時路易十四和路易十五多懂得一點地理的話丨丨老實說，如果這幾位藝術的君主覺得一張地圖比一張新織錦的彩色圖案更爲重要的話，丨丨如今新英格蘭和維基尼阿的居民大槪都是用法語而整個北美洲都由巴黎統治了。但是那些决定歐洲命運的人們並不認識新人陸有何意義。結果，坎拿大就盛的英國，魁北克（Ｑuebec）和蒙特利爾(Monltcal)也非復法國的，又經幾個世代之後，則新奧爾良和遠西全部就都賣給大西洋沿岸少數背叛的英國小屬地新近所創設的那個共和國了。雖是偉大的拿破崙，看見那用如今合衆國最富饒部分換得一堆美國金元，也認自已曾做了一椿便宜的交易。」　　這一節話很有意思，使我想到做一個元首應有多少知識這個問題。政治，經濟是不消說了。如房龍所說，則地理知識，也應十分豐富，至於歷史知識之重要，亦不待言，倘是創業的君主，則軍事知識，當然必不可少。以上種種。可以說是做元首所必需的基礎知識罷，也許還有别的更重要的但我見不到。若乎半部論語，實在是没有用處的。　　中國歷史上，不少英主賢君，他們的知識程度如何，查一查二十四史，是可以知道的但我不願去查。我知道劉邦離不開張良，劉備少不了諸葛，他們自已，是並没有多少知識的。雖然也有幾個讀過一點經史的君主，但他們的讀經史，並不是爲了求知識，只是搭個架子而已。而且中國的經史，並非有用的知識。在中國做帝王原是靠「奉天承運，」用也只用得到刀，用不到知識的。像曹操那樣，倒是少有的例外了。　　到西洋的國家的元首中去找知識充足的人，那就多了。現代固不必說，現代的俄國更不必說，就是古代，也有不少出色的帝王。最出色的，例如那亞歷山大和愷撒。　　亞歷山大是當時「學問界的大王」亞里所斯多德的弟子，他的知識當然是充足的。有充足的知識，所以有遠大的理想，當他懸軍東征之際，携希臘學者以供，使東西文化得以溝通融和，卽其到處建造文化的亞歷山大城一事，也可看出他所要建造的大帝國是怎樣的大帝國。他征波斯時，波斯國王曾廳將一半的國土公主，玉帛奉獻而請和，亞歷山大却不允許，當時大將柏爾美尼奧在側，歎曰：「我若是亞歷山大，我必允此請。」亞歷山大聽了笑道　：「我若是柏爾美尼奧，我也必允此請」。這一點，亞歷山大就比拿破崙高明得多了。　　說到愷撒，則以政治家，立法家，　學家，詩人，史學者，武將而爲羅馬共和國大總統，實爲古今中外罕見的人物，他的政績如改革財政，共制，刑制，改用歷法，救濟貧民，　　植民，保護學藝，……無不含着由賅　的知識所養成的遠大的理想。他和亞歷山大，　是氣蓋一世的大王，却並不以殘　聞，這是最萌人尋味的要是亞歷山大不早夭，愷撒不遇刺，則他們造出來的帝國，一定是很可觀的罷。　　今日的慕沙理尼，麥克唐納等人，不能說没有知識和理想，然而他們對於政治經濟的見解比起幾個俄國政治家來，不但是主義不同，實在是程度有差，所以在一切内政外交上，　　都能應付裕如，而其他各國則常感提襟見肘之苦。　　由此可知做一個元首，是如何的需要堅實的知識和遠大的理想。治國平天下，是不能單靠刀的。路易十一那種「懂得欺騙的人，就懂得治國」的話，也靠不住，他本身就不曾成功。彼得大帝爲了要歐化俄國，親身到荷蘭的造船廠中做工，求得造船的知識，他眞是一個偉大的政治家。　　　否則，卽使做到路易十四和拿破崙，也難免失敗且爲房罷所笑的。文人治病  元奕　　陳琳之檄，可愈頭風，少陵之詩，台驅瘧鬼，此說相傳之久矣；姑不論其事之確否，即令果確，然亦事出偶然，檄與詩非爲頭風瘧鬼作也，偶閱楊衒之洛陽伽藍記，却有韻語一篇，實爲治病而作；詞雖近謔，文頗可玩。今之病家，喜延道士畫符念咒，巫婆燒香退鬼者，未知視此何如也　　記中大意，謂蕭衍遣主書陳慶之送北海五入洛陽，張景仁與慶之有舊，設酒邀過其宅，在座多兩人，惟中大夫楊元愼等是中原士族；慶之醉後語　北人，元愼正色駁之。後數日，慶之過病心上急痛，訪人解治；元愼自云能解，慶之遂憑元愼，元愼即口含水噀慶之曰：　　吳兒之鬼，住居建康。小作冠帽，短製衣裳。自呼阿儂，語則阿旁。菰稗爲飯，茗飲作漿。呷啜鐏羹。唼溯蟹黃。手把豆蔻，口嚼檳榔，乍至中土，思意本鄉。急手速去，還爾丹陽。　　若其寒門之鬼，口頭猶修。網魚漉　，在河之洲。咀嚼菱藕，据拾雞頭。蛙羹蚌臛，以爲膳羞。布袍芒屨，倒騎水牛。沅湘江漢，鼓櫂邀遊。隨波溯浪，噞喁沈浮。白紓起舞，揚波發謳。急手速去，還爾揚州。　　此文原以南北之見，含有報復性質，自亦難免文人相輕之習：惟其吐辭清雅，以視今之文人，小有齟齬，輒作「潑婦駡街」式之　駡，甚或誣辱人之家屬者，相去萬里矣。閩西的婦女  謝冰瑩二、挑煤炭的女苦力　　從區委會走到煤山，雖然只有一里路光景，可是因了山路大陡，走到半途，腿子已酸軟得再不能前進了。　　「休息一下吧，没有爬過山的，初次走這樣的路，實在太吃力了。」　　郭君看出我的疲乏來了，他要我休息，我反而不好意思停住，只得提起精神拚命地往上爬。　　「不要休息，我們要一直跑到目的地，她們挑着這麽重的煤還能飛跑下來，爲什麽我們跑空路的反而不及她們呢？太惭愧了！」　　其實那時我心裏比說的還要難過，還要慚愧。　　　達到目的地了，有十多個十五六歲的小姑娘在那里等候過秤，她們每人的簸箕裡裝滿了大塊的煤，主持秤桿的人一面要記多少重·一面要收買煤的錢·忙的不得了，但他很從　容，任站在旁邊等候的有多少，他也是這般不慌不忙地呌着某人多少斤，小洋幾角·銅板幾　片。　　「爲什麽不多設幾處天秤呢？免得她們大家等候耽誤了許多時間。」我說。　　「這是給她們一個休息的機會，要不是在這兒停一下，她們整天都是過的跑路生活。」郭的回答，我才恍然覺悟到我發出來的是愚問。　　煤很便宜，每百斤只需小洋兩毛，而她們挑到城市去賣，每百斤可得小洋六毛·每天以挑四次計算，可賺得小洋十六毛，合龍岩的時價恰恰一元大洋。這種生活雖然太苦，但比較大都市裡日夜蜷伏在機器旁邊流着血汗工作，每天至多得三四毛錢的勞働工人來，她們又要自由適意多了。聽說有些體力强健而又負担繁重的婦女，她們每天也有挑兩元以上的煤的。至於她們自已家裡煮飯，很少用煤，因爲閩西的柴簡直是「取这無禁·用之不竭」的。　　有一個十二歲的女小孩子·她也裝好了滿滿的一担煤在等候着過秤，我圤去將担子放在肩上一試，不得了，剛放上去，兩肩就育起來，我速忙放下來很慚愧地說：　　「太不行了，我這歷大的一個人爲什麽不及這位小姑娘呢？」　　她們通通笑起來了，尤其是那位小姑娘笑得起勁，不錯她是應該驕傲的·她比我們每個人都要强，中國今日的男女學生；這些没有用的階級的知識份子·文不能做鐌戨武不能做挑夫的人，都應該尊敬她們，欽佩她們。　　本來我的目的是要去煤坑裏去參觀的·但因爲水太深·裡面又連豆大的燈光都没有他們都不贊成我進去，只在窰口望了好幾分鐘。裡面挖煤的人自然很多，但運輪到窰口的却只有一個，他將煤從黑洞裡灣着腰挑出來放在門口·立刻就有人來接去倒在過秤的那塊平地上，他們的動作很快，每個人都是氣喘喘地汗流滿面。每次我看到從黑漆漆的深坑裏走出來的「黑人」，只有兩只眼睛放出像星光一般的亮，我很想給他們照個相留做紀念，但可惜相機没有帶去。　　在窰口的右邊用晒蓆搭了一個三角式的棚，一個小伙計正在宰鷄·地上擺滿了酒·線春·砲竹，錢紙各臘燭等等，據說他們每逢初一十五式者什麽菩薩生日·尤其是打雷閃電不好的天氣，就要買肉買鷄來請菩薩，每次以鷄血塗在窰口邊，藉以避邪。　　陳君看她們過秤看得出了神，我更由挖煤的人而聯想到「石炭王」裡面所寫的一幕幕來。要不是竾群說「婦女靑年團」的代表在等着我們談话，我們還不知停留多少時。</p>

<p>服來討論吧。　　俗語說：「着衣看來方可以對於服裝的設計，第一先要明瞭穿衣人的經濟環境；現在李信恩君所問的，没有把經濟環境說明，也没有說明性别與職黹業，可以替他（或她）設計是很難；現在根據信中所述的髮已剪燙」，及其身長，姑作爲是問的女裝，假定她也是教育家的家庭中一個少婦或未嫁的女子而代爲設計。　　便服　可謂便服，不一定是指家裏操作的衣服；但是我假定這位女士並非一個完全有閑階級的少奶奶或摩登小姐，所以她的便服，最好不要用太考究的衣料，因爲她或者在家裡主持家政，或出外採辦東西，甚而至於她尙在學校讀書或者在教書，這套便服，是不拘什麽時候都可以穿，而無須時常更衣。衣服的式樣，只須普通的夾旗袍，袍面可用淺灰色的純紓縐，裡子用普通的素綢，衣領及襟，衣叉，等處，均鑲以三分闊的黑素緞，要是歡喜再加一條二分闊的黑堂條也可以。不但與她的肩色相構，並且有了這黑邊鑲着，可以使她略胖而不很長的身材，顯出很苗條的樣子；而且非常　雅閑靜。　　晚裝　在深秋的晚上，玉路凉重，　補生寒，所以衣料應該譔擇較厚一些的爲宜，現在上海流行一種二美縐，身骨大槪比純紓縐還厚一些，單的可以抵到一件夾衣，式樣如圖，上身用印花二美縐，下身用素黑二美縐，袖子用素白二美縐，袖口作荷葉邊闊黑邊，假使要出外去，加一件半皮短掛，（如圖）短掛用湖色美　緞（厚如華達呢·純絲織造·一面係緞子·一面如胡萄縐，上海已流行用作大衣，大都以縐面作正面）有轉門下端四英寸高處綴五英寸闊之黑西耳皮，直緣至掛之兩襟。旣秀雅，又莊重，晚上服之，生色不少。　　半正式禮服　可用淡灰色軟緞裝，式樣如左。　　遊服　深秋出遊山水，如　大衣，便覺得走路不方便，不穿大衣，又怕遇風，短掛不過美觀，更不適用，所以必須不礙步，又足禦寒，走了路又不太熱，那是很麻煩的。所以再好穿一件上面可述便服相仿綢料的綢夾衫，上身再加一件緊俏的短掛，質料可用二重緞製，記以平扁闊大淡色的鈕子，（如圖）重緞上海也流行了，兩面都是緞面，而且兩面是兩個顔色，（紅黑，或紅黃，或紅及湖色都有）遇到下細雨，可把黑的一面穿在外面；遇到括風沙，可以把黃的一面穿在外面，不是很遵宜麽？　　以上所舉，不過揣摩北方的環境而設計，也不過示其大槪，如何變化都是各人愛好不同，應出各人自已想法子了。時裝及其經濟之影響（續）奇特的志趣　狂亂的裝飾　將成爲男子的臣服  許弢　　我們到此，或者還要這樣的自問：一種時裝，已經流行於社會，本是很擾雅美好的，並且迎合社會人士的心理：但是爲什麽急急的設計其他的時裝來取而代之呢？這個問題並不開始於今日。十六世紀法國的大文學家Ｌa　Bruyere在他著作的“Calactere”上已經注意到了。　　「一種時裝，幾乎還没有消滅，另外一種，已被、更新的一　所毀廢了；但仍自已讓給追隨在後面的其他一種；可是這還不是最後的一種呢。」　　　所以要解答這個問題，確是十分困難；因爲時裝變化的原因，大多與經濟和微細的心理有關係的。　　在我個人的意見，浮華虚榮，對於女子的時裝，却有相當的關係。如其我们把事實來觀察，假使一個風流華富的女子，一看到自已所穿的衣服，在社會上已盛行了，不必說普遍，她就决不願像她的同類穿着同樣的服裝，所謂厭惡由一致而生。所以唯一的方法，就是急急的跑到幾家大裁縫店裏去，求買更新的時裝，因之這些商店操縱一切；並且對於這事，可說他們是一般摩登女子的主人翁罷。　　不過我們也須注意這些好摩登入時的女子，她们應當自已想像，設計創作時裝。否則，爲了極平常根本需要的衣着，她們就將成爲男子的臣服了。繳窮苦的工業稅　　以經濟的立脚點來說，爲了生産利益的目的，所以極力的使時裝常常的變化，甚至過度胡亂的變化·Ｃhamford曾經這樣的說：　　「時裝變化是浮華富貴繳納窮苦工業的稅。」　　時裝由忽然的回返，就戰敗了這些愛好摩登的忠臣，使她們只得重新繼續的購買；並且更利害的，使她們不能把服妝粧飾品由這季裏用到那季裏。所以在西服裏，先前穿着狹小的短裙，忽然代以寬大的長裙；在中裝裏，廢裙而代以旗袍了。還有在顔色方面，本來受人愛戴的某一種，特然的變爲另一種，不雅觀使人刺目的顔色。　　時裝常常的變化，使我們不得不想到這些過時東西的問題上去了，究竟有什麽用度，變成了什麽？對於這個問題，可不敢冒然作復。富貴的女子，當然不必說；過時東西已變爲廢物了，决不想利用的·不過在社會上，我們也可常常看到，帽上手提袋上的邊，或某些附屬品是用舊的舞衣所做的，可是這件舞衣，就是原人自已先前所穿着的；所以摩登經濟的女子，還利用廢物呢。簡單的說，時裝好像烹調一樣，女子自有她們整理所剩餘的技藝的。（仍未完）用美亞乣縵邊鑲在素綢製的新式旗袍上非常美觀嬌艶鴻翔公司　今日舉行時裝表演　　今日爲鴻翔公司十七週紀念·舉行中西時裝表演大會，時間爲今日下午四時至六時，地址靜安寺路鴻翔總公司二樓美術廳，印有秋冬季一九三四年最新式大衣樣張價目表及精美節目單，分贈來賓，並敬備茶點，請柬業已發出，惟主顧衆多，投送未免不週，尙希惠臨參觀是幸。　　又該公司以今日下午爲招待時裝會來賓，暫停營業半天，自明日起，照常營業。今日參加鴻翔時裝表演會　牛素娟女士服裝　鴻翔金義翔設計打樣新裝在色不在質  烟橋　　我每在街頭蹀蹼着，瞧見往來的婦妇們，花花綠綠，宛如到了花紙行翻樣本，眞有些耀目欲眩，我覺得有許多婦女們，雖是式樣很時新，質料很華貴，但所用的顔色不好，就不惟不美，並且有些討厭。所以我說新裝第一要在色調上研究，醬如一張畫，所用的顔色，也稱配置適當，倘然一味紅花綠葉，自然可厭了。　　顔色不只和衣服的式樣質料有關係，並且和年齡也有關係的。外國婦女，在這一點比中國婦女來得考究，儘有年紀已老，却還穿了一襲絶簿簇新而且顔色非常嬌嫩的衣服，頓覺添加了不少風韵，减輕了不少年紀。不過有些實在太老太醜的婦女，還穿着少女的衣服，愈形其可厭，彷彿一所古屋，裝置摩登電燈，愈耀眼，愈顯出蛛絲塵網的灰敗頽唐來。　　　還有一點，衣服的顔色，和時令氣候也有關係的。中國古代詩人也有春衣的名目，有了春衣，當然還有夏衣秋衣冬衣，怎樣繼合做春衣，雖没有具體的說明，但我們從多方面的觀察和推想，知道以前的衣服，都是在顔色上注意。因爲當時没有像現代那麽「花色繁多，」和「名目繁多，」只有在顔色上爭奋鬥勝了。　　所以新裝重在顔色，是中外一體，古今一致的。至於質料最平淡了，綢也好，布也好，儘有幾位娘兒們穿着布衣，非常苗條可愛，有些娘兒化了很多的錢，買外國綢，穿了還遠不及呢。我於婦女新裝是「嫡親外行，」胡說幾句，對不對請討論罷。</p>

<p>談言吃飯與作事  知行　　一般的說，在今日這樣的中國社會裏，我們只看到吃飯的人，而並没有看到我少作事的人，雖然不　武斷閱作事的人是没有的。　　吃飯，本來是很重要的事，人不吃飯，必然的會終止他的生存。然而吃起來，是要有種吃法的，西洋有句人人熟知的話說：人爲食而生呢，抑爲生而食？顯明的並不是因爲世間堆積着許多食物而要生出我和你來消受，實在是人因爲宁生存而食的，由此我們可以知道吃飯有兩種方法：一種是「爲吃飯」而「吃」飯，一種是「爲生存」而「吃」飯。爲吃飯而吃飯，凡是有一張嘴而且具有生命的物，我想都不會有這種勾當，因爲他旣有生命，總要維持他生命的生存，爲維持生命的生存，而張着嘴巴吃飯，這還不是爲吃飯而吃飯而是爲生存而吃飯了。然而爲吃飯而吃飯的人，在今日的確多着。　　人，到底是有生命的動物，他不僅只有一張嘴巴吧，爲甚麽只管張着嘴巴吃的人多呢？豈他們連自已的生命都忘却維持了乎？這個絶對不是，他們實在迫於生存的需要而吃飯，不吃飯便會滅亡。不過這只是他們就個人自已着想，而没有想及整個的社會。我在前面年說爲生存而吃飯，是含着重大的社會意義。因爲人究竟不能離開社會而能生存的，人究竟要在生存着的社會中才有他個人的生存，人究竟是與社會相終始，社會生存，人才生存；社會死滅，人必死滅。爲生存而吃飯，這並不只含着個人的意義，而是有擴大的社會意義在。由這個社會的觀點說來，可見爲個人的生存而吃飯，只是爲吃飯而吃飯。是没有的確的「生」的眞諦的。　　希臘大哲學家亞里斯多德說：「人是社會的動物」，這是的確不移的道理。我們要生存，要吃飯，就要使社會繼續生存下去，使社會的生命擴大起來。這就是說，我們要去爲社會勞動，爲社會作事。如此，我們也才有飯吃，才能繼續生活，才能安穏舒服的不斷的生活。我們如果不去勞動，不去作事，爲只圖吃，這只是消極的，生理的，求生存的行爲，只有人以外的動物才是如此丨誰都知道吧，動物只能從自然界取得自然所賦予的現存東西以苟延微命呢！可是人絶對不然，他的生存意志是積極的；非僅生理的，他還要運用他的體力智力去勞動，去作事，去從自然界開掘他的生活資料。因之，人類的物質文化才能開展，精神文化才能生長，社會才能在宇宙進化的歷程上一程一程的推進，我的生活，也才能一級一級的向人生的高　攀登。　　由上面所說，顯明的，我們知道了人不是爲吃飯而吃飯，不是爲謀狹義的生存，而是爲作事而吃飯，爲謀廣義的生存。人也只有謀取廣義的社會的生存，才能獲得狹義的個人的生存。中國社會實在糟透了，大家只管張着嘴巴吃，運用手足頭腦，體力智力去勞動去作事的人極少極少。這種只管吃的人，簡直是强盜，賊，土匪。假使這種搶刦偷竊式的行爲，長　不　的演下去，社會必然的　退，沉淪破滅，而整個的民族也必然的隨之衰退，沉淪破滅。靑年，時代的靑年，我們不要去作個光吃飯的人，而要爲社會眞眞實實的作個作事的人喲！</p>

<h3>Dispatch of Yin Tong, Li Zeyi, etc., to Conduct Negotiations Separately; Political Reorganization Committee Summons Provincial Chairmen Under Its Jurisdiction to a Meeting in Beiping; Security Forces Can Soon Head to Eastern Luan, but the Japanese Still Show Signs of Difficulty; Changli Has Passed Several Days Safely as Bandits Concentrated in Funing Taitou Camp; Yu Xuezhong Returns to Tianjin from Beiping, Sugimura Arrives in Jinan</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Huang Fu's trip north this time is to focus on North China and Japanese</p>
<p>diplomatic issues, striving for progress so that the situation in North China can achieve thorough stability in order to carry out various economic constructions. Huang, considering that piecemeal negotiations are not easy to achieve results, decided to send Yin Tong and Li Zeyi to Tokyo, Changchun, Nanjing and other places respectively to conduct comprehensive negotiations with the Japanese government, the commander of the Japanese Kwantung Army, Hishikari, and Minister Arima, etc., on North China diplomacy. Yin and Li left Beiping for Tianjin last night and will depart for their destinations within the next few days. The Political Reorganization Committee will convene a meeting on the 18th, and has telegraphed invitations to the chairmen of the provinces under its jurisdiction to attend the meeting in Beiping. Song Zheyuan and Yu Xuezhong have decided to arrive in Beiping before the 18th. It is not yet decided whether Han Fuju, Xu Yongchang, and Fu Zuoyi will come to Beiping. (13th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yu Xuezhong returned to Tianjin this afternoon. According to him, the security forces are still stationed in Lutai and can head to Eastern Luan around the 15th to carry out bandit suppression. The weapons carried are limited to light and portable ones. (13th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding the issue of bandit suppression in Eastern Luan, since Kita returned to Changchun to report to the Kwantung Army, telegrams have been frequently sent to Beiping. The bandit suppression methods have been finalized, and our security forces will soon be able to begin the suppression. In addition to artillery, other weapons such as light machine guns will be carried. Before departing from Lutai, it is said that a certain party intends to send personnel to the area to inspect the list of weapons. Our side is determined to thoroughly eliminate the bandit forces, with non-recruitment as the principle. When the bandit forces are under pressure, they will be forced to surrender their weapons, which will then be transported to the west of Lutai and disbanded. (13th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>The issue of Changli and Eastern Luan will have a new development. Changli has passed several days safely. More than two hundred bandits who had infiltrated and stayed in the camp retreated to Funing on the 13th. It is heard that the bandits are now concentrated in Funing Taitou Camp awaiting recruitment. Li Jichun's troops arrived at Anshan on the 12th but there is no further news. The county government has begun investigating and providing relief to the refugees in Changcheng. (13th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yu Xuezhong said that the remnants of Ji's troops now have the appearance of infiltrating Shunyi again. These troops number only four to five thousand and have no real strength. They can soon be wiped out in one fell swoop. The two Administrative Inspectorates of Luan, Yu, Ji, and Mi will be established after Yin Rugeng returns north. After the establishment of the two inspectorates, the War Zone Reception Committee will be abolished. Currently, war zone affairs are handled by Tao Shangming. Jiang's telegram to the provincial chairmen seeking opinions on the provincial governor system has not yet been seen by me. Changing to a provincial governor system is simpler than the committee system in terms of handling affairs, and administrative expenses can also be saved, which may not be a bad method. Regarding the Ci County incident, Committee Member Hu Yuanhui has been dispatched to investigate. The original County Magistrate Bai will not return to his post for the time being. However, the resolution of the incident must be handled by the provincial government in accordance with the law. The military branch will issue provisions to the various armies, changing to issuing them once every ten days. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Chairman of Hebei Province Yu Xuezhong returned to Tianjin from Beiping by special train at 2:30 PM on the 13th and immediately went to the provincial government to handle official business. Regarding the issue of bandit gangs in Eastern Luan, Qi Wenping, commander-in-chief of the puppet East Asia Allied Army, requested recruitment. Our authorities approved the order to concentrate all of them in Funing to await inspection. If they do not comply, troops will be sent to severely suppress them. The Kwantung Army no longer opposes our bandit suppression, but restricts the security forces to carrying no more than 100 light machine guns. Once the bandits are wiped out, the machine guns will be transported back to Tianjin. The 91st Army dispatched Zhang Peiwen, Chief of the Staff Department, to Yuguan on the 13th to liaise with representatives of the Kwantung Army to avoid further misunderstandings. It had been previously agreed that our security forces would be responsible for the southeast and west sides of Funing, while Li Jichun's troops would be responsible for the north side. Unexpectedly, the Kwantung Army requested that Li's troops be responsible for the east side. Our side immediately agreed and notified Li Jichun to move out. Li said that the Kwantung Army sent a telegram prohibiting him from moving out, so our security forces' planned departure to Eastern Luan on the 15th was again thwarted. The Political Reorganization Committee dispatched Li Zeyi to Changchun on the night of the 13th to have a final negotiation with Hishikari. As for the issue of taking over the various passes of the Great Wall, it will be discussed after the bandits are wiped out. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Konmoto, a representative of the Kwantung Army, paid separate visits to Huang Fu and He Yingqin this afternoon as private visits. According to Konmoto, Okamura will come to Beiping within the next few days. (13th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan telegraphed to Beiping, saying that he would arrive in Beiping early on the 15th to attend the regular meeting of the Political Reorganization Committee. Qin Decun will travel with him. (13th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Sugimura arrived in Jinan tonight and is staying at the Japanese Consulate. (13th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Minister Sugimura, who is on an inspection tour, arrived in Tianjin from Beiping at 11 PM last night and stayed at the Tokiwa Hotel. He told reporters who visited him that he had met with Huang Fu four times and He Yingqin three times in Beiping, exchanging opinions frankly. Both of them are extremely sincere and working hard on the construction of North China, so the impression I got was very good. Now the cooperation between powerful figures in both military and political circles in Beiping is making great efforts to improve Sino-Japanese relations, so Japan should also treat it with full understanding and be the cornerstone of East Asian peace. Minister Sugimura and Minister Tokugawa, who arrived in Tianjin from Beiping at 7:30 PM last night, attended a dinner party initiated by Consul General Awahara and sat with several key figures from the Chinese side. The two ministers took a train to Jinan together at 11 AM this morning. (13th Den-tsu Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Mr. Huang Fu, in consideration of the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations, has decided to dispatch representatives to Manchuria and Japan separately. It is heard that the representative he sent to Japan is Mr. Li Zeyi, who will travel via Shanghai to Japan. The representative sent to Changchun is Mr. Yin Tong, but Yin may transfer to a ship from Changchun to cross over. (13th Nichiren Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Mr. Yu Xuezhong, who had stayed in Beiping, returned to Tianjin at 4 PM on the 13th and made an important statement as follows: [Mr. Huang Fu, in order to sort out various Sino-Japanese problems, will come up with a decisive solution and implement the transformation of North China diplomacy. Yin Tong and Li Zeyi, who are carrying this important mission, have now been dispatched separately to Tokyo and Changchun. The two gentlemen have already departed from Beiping yesterday.] (13th Nichiren Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Xiao Zhenying Arrives in Beijing Yesterday; Post-Disaster Relief in Chahar Province is Largely Completed; Situation in Inner Mongolia is Unknown</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Xiao Zhenying arrived in Beiping this morning. According to him, the post-disaster relief in Chahar Province has been largely completed. The bandit atmosphere in Zhangbei is gradually dissipating, and the local situation is becoming more stable. I came here to report the recent situation in Chahar Province to the authorities. Song is scheduled to come to Beiping before the 18th to attend the third plenary session of the Political Reorganization Committee. Regarding the issue of autonomy in Inner Mongolia, I was originally ordered by Song to go to Pangjiang to investigate the truth. Later, the central government decided to send Enke Batu, Zhao Pilian, and Bai Yunti to Inner Mongolia for pacification, and Huang Shaoxiong will accompany them in the capacity of the Chief of Inner Mongolia, so I stopped going. As for the situation in Inner Mongolia, it is unknown. It is heard that the so-called autonomous conference has not yet been completed. I plan to stay in Beiping for a while and then go to Nanjing to meet with Jiang and report. (13th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Xiao Zhenying visited He Yingqin today, reporting on the military relief and disbandment of various miscellaneous troops in Chahar Province. Except for those troops stationed in Chahar that have been approved by the Military Branch to be reorganized into formal troops and have been transferred to designated locations for garrisoning, the remaining troops of Zhang Lingyun, Ye Yuling, Lei Zhongtian, Gao Shuxun, Song Kebin, Xu Huarong, etc. have all been disbanded. (13th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Zhangjiakou states that Song postponed his trip to Beiping due to an invitation from the Japanese Hashimoto Goro for a banquet and the Director of the Koubei Jiyan Inspection Office holding a banquet on the 14th. Li Zhongyi arrived in Zhangjiakou, and Song issued 500 sets of military uniforms to the brigade. Liu Ruming arrived in Zhangjiakou on the evening of the 12th, visited Song and reported on defense affairs, and is scheduled to return to Xiahuayuan on the 14th. Song appointed Zhao Dengyu as the Commander of Bandit Suppression in Eastern Chahar. Because bandits in Shangdu and Kangbao were causing disturbances, Zhao's division was transferred to Zhangbei, with some troops stationed in various places east, south, and north of Zhangbei. Guyuan is garrisoned by Zhang Yunrong leading Liu and Liu's troops. Zhao dispatched Chai Jianrui's regiment on the 12th to hunt down bandit gangs in the area of Shangdu, which will not be difficult to clear. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>

Today, the Japanese army east of the Bai River shelled Fang's troops in Sanjiadian, Dulinzhuang across the river, firing a total of more than twenty shells. Fang's troops fled in disorder to various places this afternoon. Several were captured by the National Army. Fang's troops are still planning to flee east. (13th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Military News: A telegram from Gaoliying states that the remnants of Fang and Ji are still based in the area of Xidulinzhuang and Yamen Village without any changes, currently in confrontation with our army. This morning, a Japanese plane flew over Dulinzhuang and dropped six bombs, then flew north. The damage is unknown. Also, a telegram from Xiyuan states that after the internal discord and disintegration of Fang and Ji's troops, Fang's troops were placed under Ji's command and fled to the area of Dulinzhuang and Yamen Village near Shunyi. It is heard that Fang himself has left the army for another location. According to reconnaissance reports, Fang is currently in Xiangyang Village, about six li northeast of Shunyi, on the south bank of the Bai River, with only a few dozen guards, and has reached the end of his rope. (13th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Shunyi states that after Fang's troops fled from Daxiaofuren and Xinzhuang to Niulanshan, there were only more than a thousand troops, distributed in the intermediate zone of Niulanshan, Gaoliying, and Shunyi, attempting to flee east. At about 1:00 AM on the 12th, about five to six hundred infantry and cavalry of Fang's army were discovered in the area of Manyingzi and Xiaoying, about eight li southeast of Gaoliying. They were surrounded and resolved by the National Army. After dawn, the bandit army collapsed. A unit of the 5th Regiment of the Japanese Army, carrying three mountain guns and machine guns, arrived near Niulanshan from Mizhongzhao yesterday morning. This afternoon, two Japanese planes circled and reconnoitered in the area of Niulanshan in Shunyi. At the same time, the Japanese army shelled the various locations occupied by Fang's army. Fang's army is isolated and helpless, and it will not be difficult to resolve them. (13th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Fang Zhenwu, who originally wanted to flee to the Eastern Luan area but has been lingering near Huairou until now, now knows that he is at the end of his rope and has lost all hope. He entrusted the remnants of his troops to Ji Hongchang, while he himself led 450 bodyguards and set off eastward towards Shunyi. His whereabouts are unknown. (13th Nichiren Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Fang-Ji Allied Army crossed Niulanshan in an attempt to flee to the Eastern Luan area, but a unit led by Captain Itagaki Masayuki of the Japanese Aomori Unit attacked the Fang-Ji army west of Niulanshan. At the same time, three airplanes distributed leaflets, prohibiting the Fang-Ji army from infiltrating Eastern Luan. As a result, the Fang-Ji army changed direction and fled west towards Dulinzhuang in Shunyi. A unit of the Japanese army is in pursuit. (13th Den-tsu Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Fang and Ji's Remnants Have Difficulty Fleeing South</h3>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Shunyi states that Fang originally planned to flee towards the Eastern Luan area, but was blocked by the Japanese army in that direction, so he turned back and fled south. They are now in the area of Yamen Village. The morale of the troops is low and the discipline is extremely poor. The National Army is blocking them everywhere, and it is not easy to flee south. A telegram from Shacheng states that Wang Ying's troops have now left Taoyukou and are fleeing towards Dushikou. (13th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Conspiracy to Seize Territory Exposed, Japan Makes Empty Threats to Russia, Claims Intention to Apply Political Pressure, Formal Protest Delayed, Araki States There is No Intention to Start a War with Russia at Present</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Foreign Ministry, regarding the Soviet Russian government's exposure of Japan's conspiracy concerning the Chinese Eastern Railway, is preparing to have the Japanese ambassador to Russia issue a stern warning. However, given the Soviet Union's past behavior, it is clear that mere verbal or written protests will have no effect. Therefore, the necessary means to achieve substantive goals are being carefully discussed with relevant parties, and it seems a decision is imminent. The Soviet side is frequently careless and irresponsible in its words and actions. If only ordinary diplomatic means are used, it will be impossible to induce any reflection on their part. Especially in light of their recent reinforcement of troops in the Far East, their provocative language towards Japan, and their arrogant attitude, Japan, in order to uphold the nation's authority, has now decided to take decisive action. Therefore, future actions will depend on the Soviet Union's moves. In short, relations between Japan and Russia are about to become increasingly serious. (Japan United News, 13th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Foreign Ministry, in order to issue a warning to the Soviet Russian government, has gathered various materials relating to official documents. This has now been completed, and Ambassador Ota in Russia will be instructed within days to lodge a formal protest. The Foreign Ministry believes that the Russian side's actions are not accidental but are a concrete manifestation of the Soviet Union's revolutionary diplomacy, which disregards international diplomacy. Therefore, it does not consider trivial matters such as the TASS news agency as problems but is determined to thoroughly punish the source. As a first step, it will refuse to mediate in the negotiations between Russia and the puppet state regarding the sale and purchase of the Chinese Eastern Railway, and in addition to applying great political pressure on the Soviet Russian government, the Foreign Ministry is currently preparing to lodge a protest based on this important decision.

<h3>Araki Says in Train He is Unwilling to Stake the Lives of Japanese Soldiers</h3>

However, I have no interest in such matters and have not considered them. Therefore, I especially hope that the entire nation knows this. Although there is much material for incompatibility with Russia, I absolutely will not stake the lives of the imperial army to engage in war with Soviet Russia. Moreover, it will not only not fight Russia, but also not fight the United States. Recently, I have heard harsh criticisms of the military. If there are criticisms, they should be expressed openly and honestly. If the criticism is appropriate, I will gladly listen. (Electric Communication Society, 13th)</p>
<h3>Citing Japanese Proverb, Russia Protests, Japanese Foreign Ministry Refuses to Accept</h3>

<h3>Two Arrested Russian Employees Released</h3>

(Electric Communication Society, 13th)</p>
<h3>Evasive Excuses are Clumsy and Ridiculous</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Since Soviet Russia published Hishikari's documents regarding the occupation of the Chinese Eastern Railway, the attitude of Japan in response has been met with growing resentment. Izvestia said that Japan's reaction to the Soviet Russian exposure of the documents only shows the embarrassing situation of those involved. Pravda said that the clumsy methods of the Japanese imperialists in attempting to evade their responsibility with evasive excuses and loud intimidation are ridiculous. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<h3>Japanese and Puppet Forces Continue Sabotage</h3>
<p>Blagoveshchensk. Reports received here regarding the Chinese Eastern Railway state that the continued aggressive actions of the Japanese and Manchu authorities have stirred up new incidents. They are striving to eliminate all Soviet personnel from the Chinese Eastern Railway. Police from the Manchu State stationed at the Manchouli station are continuing their efforts to sabotage the normal operation of the railway. On October 10th, they arrested Levitsky, the director of the locomotive depot, without any reason, and escorted him to the Boketu station under armed guard. Police at Boketu Station then arrested Kirillov, the deputy director of that section, who was a Soviet employee. The police originally intended to use these actions to thoroughly eliminate Soviet personnel in charge of the Chinese Eastern Railway, while transferring the administration of the railway section and their functions to Manchu representatives. Zhang Mingqi, the Manchu deputy director of the Chinese Eastern Railway, revoked the order by the Soviet deputy director, Tolstoy, appointing Levitsky as the director of the locomotive depot and instead appointed a Manchu official to fill the position. In response to this move, the Soviet director, Rodi, revoked the order of the Manchu deputy director and reported to the board of directors of the Chinese Eastern Railway, stating that Zhang Mingqi's illegal actions were disrupting employee discipline and hindering the operation of the railway. He also suggested that the board should take appropriate steps to stop these actions. Rodi also requested the board to find a way to protect the railway's business, so it would not be interfered with by the police and to ensure normal working conditions. (TASS, 12th)</p>
<h3>Chaotic Administration of the Eastern Railway</h3>
<p>(Harbin) Russian and Manchu employees of the Chinese Eastern Railway continue to clash with each other. In recent days, the Russian director, Rodi, and the Manchu deputy director, Zhang Mingqi, have been canceling each other's orders. Recently, the Russian director Rodi issued an order to revoke all orders issued by the Deputy Director Zhang, but Zhang issued an order to correct it. Yesterday, the board of directors held a meeting for two and a half hours to discuss the restoration of transportation at Suifenhe and Manchouli stations. The Russian directors still maintained their original proposal, demanding the immediate restoration of all transportation. However, the Manchu directors expressed their opposition, saying that if transportation is to be restored, the locomotives and other equipment withdrawn into Russian territory must first be returned to the Chinese Eastern Railway, otherwise there is no possibility of restoring transportation. At the same time, the Russian Director Rodi formally notified the board of directors that the actions of the Manchu Deputy Director were completely illegal, especially the revocation of the appointment of a certain Russian as the chief of the materials section in Manchouli, and the subsequent appointment of a certain Manchu to replace him after the chief was arrested. Therefore, Zhang Mingqi is responsible for destroying the administrative system of the Chinese Eastern Railway. He now requests the board of directors to protect the Chinese Eastern Railway from police interference and to ensure transportation. Business here remains sluggish, and all parties hope that a final solution can be found to restore everything to its former state. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<h3>London Public Opinion Favors Japan, Suppresses Russia</h3>
<p>(London) Although the London newspapers today did not carry any editorials criticizing the Chinese Eastern Railway dispute, they all carried reports about the matter in prominent positions. Those concerned with the Far East are paying close attention to this incident. Some say that Soviet Russia's accusation that Japan is deliberately inciting banditry along the Chinese Eastern Railway in order to sabotage the road has been seen repeatedly since the negotiations to sell the road began on June 26th, and Russia has not yet returned the train that Japan accused it of stealing from the road. Although people here rarely believe that Japan will sever diplomatic relations with Soviet Russia, many feel that this dispute may lead to a purely military cabinet in Japan. It is said that Japan's recent attitude towards China has become more moderate because Japan is wary of the dispute between Japan and Russia and does not want to be entangled in Chinese affairs, and recently, the news of Soviet Russian naval activities in Vladivostok has also been noted by Japan.

<h3>Japanese Kwantung Army Training Mongolian Cavalry for War Against Russia</h3>

<h3>Five-Minister Conference of the Japanese Government, Takahashi Yields to Araki, Sacrificing Fiscal Plans to Expand Armaments, So-Called Japanese National Policy Largely Determined</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) With the five-minister conference scheduled to reopen on the 16th, the political situation is quite tense. Finance Minister Takahashi expressed the following views: Although the five-minister conference is discussing diplomacy as the primary focus, diplomacy cannot ignore the background of military strength. The idea that military strength is necessary to ensure peace has been agreed upon in principle. However, the extent to which Japan's claims must be pursued and the extent to which foreign claims can be recognized have not yet been agreed upon. However, the conference will not break down. The budget for the next fiscal year must be based on the conclusions of the five ministers. If no conclusions can be reached, the budget will have to be reviewed separately. (Electric Communication Society, 13th)</p>
<h3>Outline of the So-Called Japanese National Policy</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) As a result of the three meetings of the five-minister conference, there is a general consensus on the fundamental concept of the Empire's national defense and diplomatic policy. If no special circumstances arise in the future, after a fourth five-minister conference for further review and consolidation, it will be possible to study the various policies that can be concretely implemented. This five-minister conference is closely related to the extraordinary national policy advocated by Army Minister Araki, and it is expected that the Army Minister's extraordinary national policy proposal will be on the agenda. The outline of the national policy is largely understood as follows:</p>
<p>(1) National Defense: National defense must anticipate the worst-case scenario and promptly implement the minimum necessary preparations and plans to fully protect the national territory. This must be completed by the 11th year of Showa [1936] at the latest.</p>
<p>(2) Diplomacy: Diplomacy must strive for reconciliation and avoid direct threats to the Empire as the primary objective. At the same time, the traditional diplomatic approach must be changed. Diplomacy towards China need not involve constant trickery. The focus should be on working against the anti-Japanese attitude in China.</p>
<p>(3) Rural Areas: For rural areas, promote increased production and bumper harvests, correct land rent and local taxes, control fertilizer prices, and improve financial control. Strive to reorganize debts.</p>
<p>(4) Ideology: Fundamentally reform the education system, strive to promote the Japanese spirit, eliminate social ills, and reject the influx of evil thoughts.</p>
<p>(5) Policy towards Manchuria: The primary objective is to make Manchukuo a completely ideal state. Industrial development is not allowed to violate this primary objective. Industrial development must always be based on the unified economy of Japan and Manchuria. In order to achieve this, some sacrifices from domestic industries will be unavoidable. This must be recognized.</p>
<p>(6) Finance: Establishing a sound financial system is important. However, in these extraordinary times, seeking to establish a sound financial plan is not only practically impossible but will also leave behind major hidden dangers. In order to overcome these extraordinary times, the necessary minimum expenditure cannot be spared. Whether today's expenditure is greatly harmful to the national economy is highly questionable. (Electric Communication Dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>One View: Maintaining the Principle of Non-War</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The fourth meeting of the five-minister conference was held on the 16th, but it failed to reach a conclusion, and the unresolved issues were submitted to the budget cabinet. Therefore, the future of this conference is not very optimistic. Even if we look at the achievements of the five-minister conference so far, the only point on which there is consensus is the principle of non-war between Japan and various powers. However, when considering this principle of non-war from a diplomatic and military perspective and its individual relations with various countries, there is no consensus on what kind of technical policy issues arise. That is, the Foreign Ministry and the military authorities have different views on how Japan's diplomatic and military policies towards China, the United Kingdom, the United States, Russia, and other countries should be handled in peacetime and wartime. Furthermore, the military is dissatisfied with the attitude of the government departments regarding the thorough reform of the current state of domestic society, economy, ideology, rural areas, and other issues that are fundamentally necessary for diplomatic and military work. The administrative authorities also criticize the military's views on this issue. Thus, the only point on which the five-minister conference agrees is the adoption of the principle of non-war. The five ministers have different opinions on the completion of other diplomatic outlines, the scope of improvement of the army and navy's armaments, the implementation of shipbuilding plans, and the means of implementing domestic work. Therefore, its future is attracting attention from all sides. (Japan United News, 13th)</p>
<h3>Araki to Save Japan with Cannon Fire</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) At the Japanese government's five-minister conference, the military and financial factions are still in dispute, and the debate is so intense that no conclusion has been reached. Army Minister Araki, on his way to Mie Prefecture this afternoon, told reporters that the contents of the meeting could not be discussed. The military's position is to reorganize armaments to cope with the crisis of 1936, with the aim of protecting national territory and carrying out national policy. The army is preparing to deal with Russia, and the navy is on guard against the United States. However, the army authorities are not preparing to start a war with Russia or the United States, but are only advocating preparation for a rainy day. Who said they wanted to go to war with the United States or Russia? Japan's aim in withdrawing from the League of Nations was to uphold the independence of Manchukuo and maintain peace in the Far East. Because Japan's policy was not understood by the League of Nations, it broke away from the League. It has been less than eight months since the withdrawal from the League. What has become of the initial aspirations? Look at how dangerous the internal and external situation is, how profound the suffering in the rural areas is, how bleak the situation is for small and medium-sized businesses and industries, and how workers are living. If this extremely critical national situation is not seen, what is the point of talking about extraordinary times or not? There is much criticism of the military in the country for acting perversely. What perverse acts has the military committed? Look at the misery in the rural areas before speaking. If the rural areas cannot recover and farmers cannot find a way out, the inherent Japanese spirit will ultimately have no way to be preserved. Relieving the rural areas cannot be done with empty words, nor can it be done solely with money. If the government authorities do not realize this, I, Araki, have my own determination and there is no need to talk empty words and shirk responsibility. If each cabinet member can understand this internal and external crisis, the national policy can be decided. The Army Ministry's national defense target is based on Russia as a hypothetical enemy. This is common sense in national defense and is not something to be considered remarkable. Moreover, the military has no intention of challenging the United States or Russia. However, if the United States and Russia are unwilling to understand Japan's national policy, it will not hesitate to fight when necessary. (China United News, 13th)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>In Response to Mr. Miyazaki and Mr. Noda, and a Message to the Japanese People</h3>
<p>— Zi</p>
<p>Just as I was about to write a response to Mr. Miyazaki Ryusuke's "Letter to the Chinese People," Mr. Noda Bunkichiro, representative of the Japanese National League, who arrived in Shanghai from Northeast China and Tianjin, requested that this newspaper publish his "Letter to Allied Nations." At the same time, various Japanese news agencies also translated and sent this manuscript. Therefore, I will state the fundamental views of the Chinese people on the Sino-Japanese problem and also respond to the two gentlemen. Mr. Miyazaki is the son of Miyazaki Toten, a close friend of Sun Yat-sen. In the Japanese political faction system, he belongs to the Social Democratic Party. What he wants the Chinese people to understand is Japan's position in opposing the Anglo-Saxons. Mr. Noda is the Secretary-General of the Japanese right-wing political party, the National League. The words he uses to inform the Chinese people clearly show the true colors of the League. He speaks from the starting point of the East Asian Monroe Doctrine and the union of Japan and Manchuria. I deeply regret that I cannot abandon the position of the Chinese people to accept the advice of the two gentlemen. However, since the two gentlemen have expended their efforts to create formal letters to give as gifts, I will also give a sincere response, hoping that the two gentlemen will correct their erroneous views and convey them to other Japanese people with the same erroneous views.</p>
<p>The two gentlemen have a fundamental error in their observation of the Chinese people, which is that they have failed to see the advantage of the Chinese national character's perseverance. China has suffered from foreign invasion and oppression for nearly 600 years. At the same time, it has also gained some experience in resisting oppression through long-term dealings with foreign races. This experience helps the unyielding national character. This is the origin of the recent Chinese national movement. The Chinese people have recently fully realized that in today's world, succumbing to a foreign race will make it impossible to turn the tables. The Chinese people recognize that modern imperialist countries are definitely not comparable to the Yuan and Qing dynasties of the past. If China makes a mistake, it will enslave its descendants for generations. Therefore, Miyazaki's worry that China will be jointly managed and divided after defeating Japan is pure overthinking. Mr. Noda's desire to persuade the Chinese people to forget the danger of national subjugation and the pain of lost territory with "a magnanimous mind that takes the world as home" and "a philanthropic heart that takes humanity as friends" is also commendable. The Chinese people today clearly recognize the way out for their country. They can only fight against the invaders with their unyielding nature. This kind of unyielding struggle cannot be relaxed by any anesthetizing rhetoric. I hope that enlightened Japanese people will not ignore it.</p>
<p>Mr. Miyazaki wants the Chinese people to understand that "once Japan is caught in the vortex of a world-class turmoil, it must make its economy self-sufficient. Manchuria goes without saying. Even the Chinese coast must be included in Japan's military strategic sphere." Mr. Noda wants China to understand that the Manchurian Incident has passed the era of discussion and wants enlightened Chinese people to understand Japan's sincerity, abandon their anti-Japanese attitude, and enter into a defense alliance or an economic alliance. If we had not heard the fallacies of Japanese militarist aggression, we would be shocked to hear such rhetoric. I really feel that I have nothing to say in response to this. I only hope that the two gentlemen will reflect on themselves. If there is a country that treats Japan in the same way that Japan treats China today, and then tries to persuade Japan with such rhetoric, what will the Japanese people do? Except for a few shameless Chinese traitors, the Chinese people are not completely foolish. I hope that the two gentlemen and other enlightened Japanese people will refrain from expending their efforts on such absurd remarks.</p>
<p>Now, I will state my views on resolving the Sino-Japanese dispute and sincerely respond to the two gentlemen.</p>
<p>1.  The Northeast is Chinese territory, and China has sacred sovereignty. If Japan changes its course and allows China to restore its territorial integrity, there will be an opportunity for understanding and cooperation between the Chinese and Japanese people. Otherwise, the Chinese people will never forget the pain of lost territory and the danger of national subjugation.</p>
<p>2.  World peace and the independence of East Asian nations are the wishes of the Chinese people. However, its foundation lies in China, the largest country in the world and the largest nation in East Asia, enjoying complete freedom and independence. The so-called Asian Monroe Doctrine promoted by Japan is not something that the Chinese people can recognize.</p>
<p>3.  The alliance under the city is something that the Chinese people have deeply shamed themselves for. If you want to go even further and induce the Chinese people to willingly become slaves, it is absolutely impossible. Mr. Noda said that "Heaven has destined the two countries to establish friendly relations. If anyone deliberately violates the will of Heaven, the disaster of national subjugation is imminent." I want to ask which country will hinder friendly relations and be subject to national subjugation.</p>
<h3>Revolution Breaks Out Again in Siam, Military Launches Uprising to Restore Royal Power, War Breaks Out Outside Bangkok</h3>
<p>Bangkok. A revolution has broken out again in Siam. Judging from the current signs, it may be more serious than the revolutions in June 1932 and June of this year. It is reported that Prince Bavoradej of the royal family is currently leading troops towards Bangkok. Traffic is now disrupted and sluggish, and news coming in and out is subject to strict censorship. The government has issued a public statement stating that it intends to quell the rebellion and restore order, and assures foreign missions that it will be responsible for the safety of foreign lives and property. Siam has had two revolutions in twelve months. The most recent one was on June 15th of this year, when General Phraya Phahonphonphayuhasena sent troops to guard government offices and key points around the palace, arresting key cabinet members. The conservative government was then forced to resign. An un-bloody revolution occurred in June of last year, as a result of which the King changed his absolute monarchical status to a constitutional monarch. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<h3>Martial Law Declared in Siamese Capital</h3>
<p>Bangkok. Two battalions of rebel troops have occupied Don Muang Airport, eight miles from Bangkok. Loyal troops are currently fighting them. Martial law has been declared here, and reinforcements are being called in from various places to defend the capital. The city is currently peaceful, and the people have not shown any signs of panic. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<h3>Rebel Troops Occupy Airport</h3>
<p>(London) The Daily Mail's Bangkok correspondent telegraphed today, reporting that martial law has been declared in Siam because troops stationed upstream have launched an uprising, attempting to attack the capital city. They are currently fighting government troops eight miles north of the capital. The Royal Air Force headquarters at Don Mueang Airport has been occupied by rebel troops. Military forces have been deployed to protect government offices and foreign banks in Bangkok. However, there is no unrest in the city, and the people are at peace. The King and Queen are currently residing in Hua Hin, a coastal resort. (National News, 13th)</p>
<h3>Royalists Plot to Rise Again</h3>
<p>(London) In recent months, there has been growing opposition within Siam to the current government, which has communist tendencies. It is believed that this military uprising is intended to restore royal power, placing it in a truly constitutional monarchical position. Since the first revolution in June 1932, the King's power has been greatly diminished. Even the current Prime Minister, Phraya Phahonphonphayuhasena, is merely a puppet supported by the people because of his popularity, with real power held by about twenty young army officers and four or five young navy officers. The person directing them from behind the scenes is Prince Pridi Banomyong, who currently resides in Paris. It is reported that the leader of the anti-government army this time is another group of navy officers who oppose those individuals and have a determination to eliminate communism.

<h3>Deadlock in Disarmament Talks: Britain, America, and France Inevitably Break with Germany; Italy's Attitude Wavering, Germany More Determined; Hindenburg Attends Cabinet Meeting, Exerts Power</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Although Britain, America, and France have made every effort to avoid a break with Germany on the disarmament issue, the atmosphere now appears very bleak. It is reported that when the British Foreign Secretary met with the American representative Davis yesterday, the German representative Nadolny arrived and stated that he would go to Berlin to consult with his government because his government is now even more determined than before. Future developments will hinge on today's Berlin cabinet meeting. President Hindenburg's attendance will exert his unquestionable authority on the cabinet's decisions, and the result may be announced by Chancellor Hitler in a public speech. The original plan was to submit a proposal at the General Commission meeting of the Disarmament Conference on Monday, reaffirming three points in the Paris Accords: (1) no rearmament, (2) gradual disarmament, and (3) managing German armaments for a certain period before making concessions to Germany. However, this proposal has now been abandoned because of Italy's wavering attitude and America's insistence that Germany must adhere to this plan, with no possibility of compromise. It is expected that British Foreign Secretary Simon will explain the situation of the negotiations to the General Commission and suggest future procedures, likely appointing a committee of jurists to find a solution. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<h3>Germany Demands Defensive Armaments</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Currently, representatives of various countries are still employing tactics and engaging in intrigue to break the disarmament deadlock, but hopes remain extremely slim. The conversation between German representative Nadolny and the British representative yesterday clearly demonstrated that Germany will not sign the disarmament treaty unless its demand for defensive armaments is met. Tonight, Nadolny met with British representative Simon again, and Simon had previously met with American representative Davis. (National Telegram, 12th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Talks on the Disarmament Conference continue. American representative Davis met with Italian representative Soragna this morning. Late last night, British Foreign Secretary Simon and American representative Davis both met with German representative Nadolny. The two reiterated the stance agreed upon by the French, British, and American representatives to Nadolny. The content of the above-mentioned talks is unknown to the outside world. However, it is reported that Nadolny seemed to have asked Davis what kind of weapons Germany would be allowed to equip if its national defense system were changed to a short-term conscription system. Davis seemed to have replied that the weapons would still be limited to those allowed by the Treaty of Versailles, with no additions or reductions. (Havas, 12th)</p>
<h3>Supervision of Armaments Becomes Key Issue</h3>
<p>(Geneva) France, Britain, and America have essentially agreed to the proposal to establish a neutral international committee to conduct a trial period of four years of arms supervision. A draft resolution is currently being negotiated, which will officially inform Germany that it must not possess armaments beyond those stipulated in the Treaty of Versailles during these four years. At this time, German representative Nadolny was suddenly recalled to Berlin by Chancellor Hitler, who specially sent a plane to Basel to pick Nadolny up and return to the capital. Nadolny has already gone to that location to prepare to take the plane tomorrow morning. This move has a somewhat mysterious meaning. (National Telegram, 12th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) In order to reach a compromise, the United States has expressed its willingness to shorten the trial period of arms supervision to 18 months. If Germany can accept this proposal, it is hoped that France will agree to a theoretical agreement allowing Germany to possess the same defensive weapons as France, but Germany cannot actually possess them until after the trial period. This proposal by the United States may be acceptable to all parties, but most observers in Geneva are still apprehensive about the arms supervision plan. If it cannot be agreed upon soon, the Disarmament Conference will encounter a serious crisis. (National Telegram, 12th)</p>
<h3>France Insists on Four Years of Arms Supervision</h3>
<p>(Paris) Today's French cabinet meeting insisted on the original proposal that the first trial period for arms management should not be shorter than four years, because it will take at least four years for the German National Defense Forces to undergo a system change. It also believes that in order to effectively monitor military budget expenditures, a longer period is necessary. The cabinet meeting discussed disarmament matters for a long time, so the emergency financial proposal to reduce the budget deficit by 600 million francs has been postponed. Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour returned from Geneva and attended the cabinet meeting, giving many statements regarding the disarmament discussions in Geneva. Another cabinet meeting will be held at the end of this week to prepare to submit the financial proposal to the Chamber of Deputies next Tuesday. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<h3>Presidium Meeting Today</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The situation regarding the disarmament issue has clearly progressed since last night. Therefore, at the request of British Foreign Secretary Simon and American representative Davis, the draft resolution prepared by experts from Britain, America, and France has been abandoned. This decision was the result of considering various circumstances, and the Italian side's silence was also one of the reasons for abandoning the draft resolution. Foreign Secretary Simon is now leaning towards the suggestion made by Disarmament Conference Chairman Henderson at the last Presidium meeting. At that time, Henderson requested the British delegation to revise the British disarmament plan to take into account the various points of agreement obtained in recent negotiations. Therefore, British Foreign Secretary Simon may explain the revised British disarmament plan to the Disarmament General Commission next Monday, and the main principles, which should have been included in today's abandoned draft resolution, will be specially elaborated upon. As for the Disarmament Conference Presidium, it will probably meet on Saturday, even if German representative Nadolny and Italian representative Aloisi cannot return to Geneva on that day, the Presidium will still meet at that time. However, if so, the work of the Presidium meeting will be limited to determining the agenda of the General Commission meeting on Monday and recording Foreign Secretary Simon's proposal. The Italian government's disengagement from the disarmament talks has caused other countries to change their attitudes, which cannot help but be considered strange in Geneva. It is rumored that the Italian government has voluntarily submitted new proposals to Germany. This statement is only for reference and its credibility is unknown. This morning, Italian representative Soragna visited everywhere, having visited Simon and Davis, and also visited Reinbaben, who is temporarily replacing German Chief Representative Nadolny. It is also heard that German Chief Representative Nadolny, before departing for his country yesterday, seemed to have a more assertive attitude than before when he first visited Simon. In any case, one point declared by the official spokesman of the American delegation this morning is extremely noteworthy, namely that although the draft resolution prepared by experts from Britain, America, and France has been abandoned, this matter must not be regarded as a disagreement between Britain, America, and France. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Relieves Jews</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Administrative Council meeting today passed the suggestion to set up an agency to deal with the problem of Jews fleeing Germany. The German representative did not vote at the time. A High Commissioner will be appointed and a relief agency will be established as soon as possible. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<h3>German Spies Reconnoiter French Border Defenses; Twelve Arrested in Succession</h3>
<p>After the American authorities arrested the German female spy Sophie, the French authorities discovered Germany's largest espionage organization since the signing of the peace treaty. Its purpose was to investigate the detailed situation of the recently completed French eastern border forts. Therefore, the number of people arrested has reached eight, totaling twelve including those arrested previously. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<h3>Various Countries Send Notes to Germany Protesting the Assault of Foreign Nationals</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The United States, Britain, the Netherlands, and Spain all sent notes to Germany today, stating that the assault of their nationals must be stopped immediately, otherwise extremely serious consequences will occur in diplomatic relations. Yesterday, the American note listed more than forty cases of American nationals being assaulted. The American Embassy is deeply concerned that members of the National Socialist Party will once again insult American nationals. A spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry commented on US Secretary of State Hull's request for the immediate arrest of the perpetrators, saying that the German authorities had not delayed at all and are now doing everything in their power to handle the cases. The main point of today's notes from the four countries is that, apart from Germany's formal apology after their nationals were assaulted, there was no other action taken. It is reported that Germany had previously received similar notes from Switzerland, Poland, the Soviet Union, Austria, and Czechoslovakia. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<h3>Karakhan Returns Home After Visiting Persia, Says Trip Was Fruitful</h3>
<p>After returning home from Persia, Deputy Commissar for Foreign Affairs Karakhan of Baku gave an interview to the local newspapers, saying that the main result of his trip to Persia was that the leaders and officials of Persia and the Soviet Union were able to have direct contact, and mutual understanding was achieved on various issues related to both parties. At the same time, this trip also helped to eliminate some obscure points in the past relations between the two countries. According to Karakhan's statement, the results of this trip will promote the improvement of relations and consolidate Soviet-Persian friendship. (Tass, 11th)</p>

<h3>Fascist Movement Spreads to America; Party Leader Leads Team to Washington, Claiming to Support Roosevelt's Dictatorship; Police Arrive, Yellow-Shirt Comrades Scatter Like Birds and Beasts; Firearms Found, Twenty-Three Arrested in Philadelphia</h3>
<p>(Washington) The American Fascist Party marched to Washington in a team today. When they reached the border of the city, they were stopped by the police and dispersed. Few people knew about the existence of a fascist movement in the United States before today. These people, numbering several hundred, are called the Yellow-Shirt Team. This morning, the authorities suddenly heard that forty-four members of the Yellow-Shirt Team were marching towards Washington, having reached the border, intending to seize political power and make President Roosevelt a dictator. Roosevelt immediately sent the police to stop them at the border. These people dispersed without resistance. Their leader, Whitebloom, and twenty-three other leaders had already been arrested by the police in Philadelphia this morning. According to the police, these people had obtained firearms and attempted to gather comrades from eastern cities today and march to Washington. Unexpectedly, the comrades failed to gather as scheduled. Only Philadelphia and Baltimore mobilized, and due to timing differences, only forty-four people from Baltimore reached the border of Washington, D.C.</p>
<h3>Demonstrations Against Trade Union Federation</h3>
<p>Observers here speculate that these people probably resented the American Federation of Labor's excessive statements regarding the industrial recovery plan, so they wanted to march to the capital on the closing day of its conference to show their strength. At the last meeting of the American Federation of Labor conference, Green was re-elected as president and several resolutions were passed opposing currency inflation, supporting the independence of the Philippines, and supporting President Roosevelt's recovery plan. (National Telegram, 12th)</p>
<h3>15,000 Party Members</h3>
<p>Philadelphia: Today, Philadelphia arrested twenty-seven members of the fake fascist Gray Shirt Party. These people were waiting for the order of their leader, Art Smith, to prepare to go to Washington with 15,000 fellow party members to support President Roosevelt as dictator.</p>
<h3>Promoting Short Shirts for Profit</h3>
<p>The police chief claimed that this plan was a trick to sell short shirts. Art Smith advised party members to only buy gray shirts from him and not to buy them on the market. The police are now searching for Art Smith, but his whereabouts are unknown. Although the police chief said it was for the purpose of selling gray shirts, what the party purchased seemed to be more than just gray shirts. Today, when the police searched their three offices, they found live ammunition, handguns, knives, and clubs. According to the police, the party members planned to attack the armory of the 111th National Guard Regiment and rob its weapons. It is estimated that several thousand party members were mobilized in preparation for marching to Washington. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<h3>American Federation of Labor Opposes Unlimited Currency Inflation; Labor Strikes in Various Industries Hinder Recovery; President Personally Intervenes; Three Explosions Occur in Mining Area for No Reason</h3>
<p>(Washington) The American Federation of Labor's 600 delegates convened a conference today and officially announced their opposition to any unlimited currency inflation. The conference also unanimously approved the committee's report, warning the authorities not to adopt currency measures that could increase the burden on workers. President Roosevelt has now personally intervened, intending to stop the strike wave. At the same time, the reorganization of the National Recovery Administration is proceeding rapidly. NRA Administrator General Johnson met with Agriculture Secretary Wallace today, intending to jointly handle the plans of the National Recovery Administration and the Rural Relief Administration to achieve comprehensive consideration. It appears that the Departments of Commerce, Labor, Justice, and Agriculture will all participate in the recovery process of the NRA. The American Miners' Federation proposed expanding the board of directors of the National Federation of Labor, but this proposal has been rejected, and Green, the former president, was still supported by the public and re-elected as president. Regulations for the film, retail, wholesale, and construction industries have not yet been established. General Johnson has extended the deadline for the establishment of industry regulations from November 1st to December 1st. Attorney General Cummings has now announced that anyone hoarding cash exceeding the limit announced by President Roosevelt by more than one hundred dollars without reporting it will be subject to criminal prosecution by the court. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>Sullivan: Three explosions occurred in Sullivan, Indiana, today, shaking the entire city. Troops are now patrolling the streets. The authorities also sent a team of soldiers to the mining area. Soldiers inspected all vehicles on the roads leading to Sullivan. However, the cause of the explosions is still unknown. The first sound shook houses, followed by two loud sounds. However, the third sound seemed to be farther away from the city. Wage disputes in the steel, coal, and cotton industries across the country are still hindering industrial recovery. Mediators are now doubling their efforts to mediate. Strikers in the bituminous coal industry formed picket lines today to monitor the Galati steel plant in Claydon, Pennsylvania, with the aim of inducing steel plant workers to join the movement to recognize the union. Thousands of steel workers in Weirton, West Virginia, staged demonstrations and threw stones at the police. The police opened fire and used tear gas to disperse the crowd. The wife of Pennsylvania Governor Pinchot told steel workers today that personnel from the Appollo Steel Trust Company should be held responsible for the current disturbances in the state's industry.

<h3>South Irish Congress Passes Constitutional Amendment; Governor's Power Almost Completely Deprived</h3>
<p>Dublin: Today, the Irish Congress unanimously passed the third bill to amend the constitution. The first bill is to abolish the British monarch's representative's power to recommend appropriations, which will be exercised by the Executive Council of the Free State. The second is to revoke the British monarch's representative's power to reject the approval of bills. The third is to abolish the power to appeal to the Privy Council. If this bill is implemented, it will almost completely deprive the governor's power and sever relations with the British monarch. This is a necessary step before Ireland declares a republic.

<h3>Japan's Arsonist; Actions Unpredictable; Police Helpless</h3>
<p>Tokyo Asahi Shimbun reported that after going to Shikoku and Kyushu to set fire to twenty-nine places, the arsonist, who has never been heard of, went to Wakayama on the fifteenth of last month and burned the Tenrikyo Church's branch office, then went to Osaka and burned the Tenrikyo Church and the Kinryo Elementary School. On the 2nd, he sneaked into Hyogo Prefecture and burned the Toyooka Elementary School, traveling around the country unpredictably. Although the police authorities in various prefectures have made every effort to search, they have been unable to find any clues due to his mysterious actions, and have instead been ridiculed by the arsonist. He has repeatedly sent letters to various parties, predicting where he will go to commit arson in the future, but it is still difficult to obtain any clues and there is no way to start. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the 3rd, a certain place in Osaka received another letter from him, predicting that he would go to Tokyo in the future. The Osaka Prefectural Criminal Division immediately telegraphed the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department. The Metropolitan Police Department suspects that the arsonist is Nouchi Seiji, a resident of Nagano Prefecture, because he has a history of mental illness and the second finger joint of his right hand is broken. However, whether the arsonist is actually this person is still in question. Currently, the Osaka Prefecture is using forensic and identification departments to conduct a full-scale investigation based on scientific examination methods, using blood type arson data to find his whereabouts, hoping to find his trace.</p>

<h3>Public Telegram</h3>
<p>Xining Telegram. To all newspaper offices: Qinghai Province is unfortunately plagued by frequent disasters. This year, there was severe drought, followed by torrential rains in the autumn. After the floods receded, there were hailstorms. Calamities followed one another, and the people suffered to the extreme. Tongren, Datong, Gonghe, Guisheng, and other counties suffered particularly severe flooding. Xining, Hualong, Huzhu, Xunhua, Huangyuan, and other counties suffered from floods and hailstorms, and the fields and houses turned into marshlands. Agricultural products turned into rotten grass, and the number of deaths of people and animals is countless. We are receiving telegrams pleading for help. The tragic situation is unbearable to read. According to statistics, almost every county in the province has been affected by disasters, and the disasters are severe. We are deeply saddened. The people are struggling to survive and the disaster-stricken people are waiting for relief. Our association is responsible for relief, and we are currently trying to raise funds, but our financial resources are extremely limited. It is difficult for even the most skilled housewife to cook without rice. We respectfully send this telegram to plead on behalf of the disaster-stricken people. We sincerely hope that all leaders and organizations will remember the pain and view the people as their own children. We implore you to allocate relief funds to benefit the disaster-stricken people. Six million starving people are exposed to the weather. In this urgent situation, we cannot express our deep concern enough. We earnestly look forward to your response.

<h3>Black Province Volunteers Intercept Japanese Gunboat - Yijun of Sancha River Boards Japanese Ship at Night - After Capturing the Japanese Ship, It Was Pulled to the Upper Reaches of the Nen River</h3>
<p>According to a dispatch from Harbin, after the civil uprising in several western counties of Heilongjiang Province, the Japanese Kwantung Army stationed in Harbin received an urgent report and immediately dispatched three battalions of marines. On the 7th, they boarded the Pengxiang and Daheihe gunboats from Harbin and sailed up the Songhua River to the Nen River, intending to fight the volunteer army formed by the civil uprising. However, the volunteers learned of this in advance and dug more than 200 "victorious pits" (i.e., trenches) on both sides of the Sancha River, the boundary between the Nen River and the Songhua River, preparing to fight the Japanese army to the death. On the evening of the 9th, the Japanese gunboats sailed to the Sancha River. Because the banks of the river were overgrown with willow trees and the river was very narrow, only about a mile wide, the Japanese army, unfamiliar with the river channel, dropped anchor and stopped sailing that night. The Japanese army also did not know that there were volunteers lurking on both sides of the river. At about 11 o'clock, the sky was overcast and it was raining lightly, making it exceptionally dark. The volunteers then sent more than 100 people in four sailboats to secretly approach the Japanese ship. They gave a secret order and boarded the Japanese ship together. Gunshots rang out simultaneously from all directions. The Japanese army was unprepared and also failed to keep a proper watch. The two sides engaged in hand-to-hand combat on the ship for about three hours, killing more than 30 Japanese soldiers and capturing two Japanese captains alive. The remaining Japanese soldiers jumped into the river and drowned. The volunteers seized more than 100 rifles, four light machine guns, and three mortars. More than 10 Japanese soldiers were injured. Four Chinese sailors on the ship were injured. Another Japanese ship, about a mile away, heard the gunshots and fled. On the morning of the 10th, a unit of the volunteers boarded the captured Japanese ship and ordered the sailors to steer it to the upper reaches of the Nen River. Volunteers on both banks escorted the ship. It is also reported that they are now actively expanding their strength to prepare for another battle with the Japanese army. The Japanese ship that fled arrived in Harbin on the evening of the 10th. Upon hearing the report, the Kwantung Army headquarters in Harbin urgently dispatched four small ships carrying more than 500 Japanese and puppet troops from Harbin to pursue the volunteers.

<p>According to a dispatch from Hankou, Japanese General Yamamoto recently completed his inspection in Shanghai. On the 8th, he boarded the Tenryu flagship from Shanghai and came to Hankou to inspect the navy upstream. The Hishi and Nana warships followed. Because they were conducting reconnaissance along the Yangtze River at Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Wuhu, Anqing, Hukou, Jiujiang, Wuxue, and Huangshi, they will not arrive in Hankou until the 14th. The commander of the 11th Fleet stationed in Hankou, Banno, received Yamamoto's telegram and immediately ordered all subordinate warships to gather in the Han River to await inspection. In addition to the Ataka flagship, which was originally anchored in Hankou, the Hira, Futami, Fushimi, and Toba warships also arrived one after another. As the inspection date approached, Banno, on the 12th, telegraphed the Japanese warships in Chongqing, Changsha, Yichang, Shashi, and other places upstream to come quickly, requiring them to arrive before the 14th. At the same time, he ordered all the marines from the Ataka, Hira, Futami, Fushimi, and Toba warships anchored in Hankou to land and form three small teams. At 2:00 PM on the 12th, they held a protection exercise in the Japanese concession, commanded by Captain Akazawa, for about an hour. Banno then inspected the streets before sounding the signal to return to the ships. The Japanese Consulate in Hankou recently received a telegram from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, selecting those familiar with the situation in our country to go to the puppet [Manchukuo] to serve. The quota stipulates eight people from Hankou, one from Chongqing, one from Yichang, two from Changsha, one from Zhengzhou, and one from Jiujiang, for a total of 14 people, all of whom will gather in Hankou and go to Shanghai before transferring to the puppet state.

<h3>Sichuan Bandits Capture Five Counties - Ten Counties Harassed - Hebei Bandits Also Flee to Eastern Sichuan - He Chengjun Returns to Hankou to Discuss the Sichuan Situation</h3>
<p>According to a dispatch from Hankou, Xu Xiangqian's remnant bandits took advantage of the war in Sichuan to flee into northern Sichuan, first occupying the three counties of Tongjiang, Nanjiang, and Bazhong, and then capturing the two counties of Qu County and Peng'an. The ten counties of Wanyuan, Kaijiang, Guangyuan, Zhaohua, Cangxi, Zhong, Yilong, and Yingshan were all harassed. The disaster is imminent. He Long's remnant forces, after suffering losses in Hunan and Hubei, also fled in three routes to Youyang and Qianjiang in eastern Sichuan, echoing Xu's bandits, and the situation has become even more dangerous. Although the Sichuan Provincial Bandit Suppression Army has been deployed for a long time, it has not yet been dispatched. Recently, excessive pressure for funds has aroused public resentment, to the point where officials collecting funds were robbed and killed, attracting red bandits into the territory. Among the generals, while outwardly supporting Liu Xiang, they still inevitably harbor suspicions. For example, Fu Tian Songyao telegraphed from Chongqing, earnestly declining the post of bandit suppression director. Tian denied this and was deeply resentful of the source of the news from Chongqing, specifically requesting Liu Xiang to investigate. This is clear evidence that the corruption in Sichuan is not without reason. He Chengjun entered Sichuan as a representative of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to administer the oath, with the main task of uniting the generals and promoting bandit suppression. On the 4th of this month, Liu Xiang took office as the commander-in-chief of the Sichuan Provincial Bandit Suppression. On the 5th, He immediately convened a bandit suppression meeting to decide on a strategy. On the 6th, Liu appointed Deng Xihou, Tian Songyao, Yang Sen, Liu Cunhou, Wang Lingji, and Li Qixiang as commanders of various routes and issued a general mobilization order that evening. He completed his official duties in Sichuan, left Chengdu on the 7th, arrived in Chongqing on the 8th, and took the Yongnian wheel east on the 10th. On the morning of the 12th, he arrived in Yichang and took a postal plane east at 2:00 PM, arriving in Hankou at about 4:00 PM. He Chengjun gave a speech saying, "The momentum of the Sichuan bandits has not subsided. The previously occupied counties include Tongjiang, Nanjiang, and Bazhong. Tongnan has already been recovered, but it has been lost again due to the impact of the war. Now it is reported that Qu County and Peng'an have also fallen, for a total of five counties occupied by bandits. Ten counties have been harassed without being captured. The people in various places have been ravaged by the bandits like water becoming deeper and fire becoming hotter, and they urgently hope that the army will advance to suppress the bandits in order to relieve their suffering. I met with Liu Xiang, Deng Xihou, Tian Songyao, Yang Sen, and others in Chengdu. Only Liu Cunhou was at the front line supervising the army and did not attend. All the generals share the same will to suppress the bandits and secure Sichuan, and are willing to work together to eliminate the remnant bandits. Liu Xiang has dispatched nine brigades of troops, together with various armies, for a total of 33 brigades, to conduct a general mobilization for suppression. The bandit suppression funds were originally planned to raise 4 million yuan, but due to the depletion of local resources and the unwillingness of the people to supply, it is still difficult to raise enough funds in the short term. The departure of Fan Shaozeng's army without receiving travel expenses shows one aspect of the difficulty. After Liu Wenhui's defeat at the Min River and the reorganization of the factory department by Liu Xiang, there are more than 30,000 rifles. Now in Ya'an, there are only 10,000 people and 7,000 rifles. Liu Xiang has left a small number of troops to prevent him from rising again, which is not a cause for concern. The other generals have expressed their support for Liu Xiang, which is a good opportunity to eliminate the red bandits and unify Sichuan. However, bandit suppression requires simultaneous military and political progress. In addition to the efforts of various armies to clear out the bandits, it is hoped that the authorities will improve politics and achieve the effect of military and political cooperation. To unify Sichuan, the central government must reorganize the army after the bandits are cleared, unify the salaries, fundamentally improve politics, and thoroughly reorganize finances. Only then can true unification be realized. Sichuan Province has always been rich in resources, the best in the country. If things are organized, then there will be no wasted resources. This is what we must hope from the central and local authorities to work together." It is reported that He will rest for a day or two and then go to Jiangxi to meet Chiang Kai-shek to report on the situation in Sichuan. It is also reported that Liu Xiang will entrust He to take his plan for suppressing bandits and securing Sichuan to Jiangxi for Chiang to review and approve. (12th)</p>

<h3>A Perilous Account of the Bandit Disaster in Eastern Luan (Part 1) - The Aftermath of Funing's Capture by Bandits - 50,000 Refugees Wandering in Distress - Dou Xizhe Resolves to Defend Changli to the Death</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Mainland</p>
<p>The Luan East bandit suppression issue, which has been going on for months, has become more acute since Funing County was captured by bandits. At that time, the bandits planned to continue their westward flight, so Changli and Luan counties were completely in a state of extreme terror. The reporter recently experienced a dangerous situation and conducted on-the-spot interviews, and will describe in detail what he heard and saw below, in order to concern those who care about the Luan East region.</p>
<h3>The Formation of Bandits and the Fall of Funing</h3>
<p>Whether the Luan East bandits have a background is clear to discerning people. However, the content of these bandits and their current situation are indeed little known to the outside world. According to reports, the only leading organization of the bandits is the East Asia Alliance Allied Army. The bandit army headquarters is located in Qinhuangdao. The commander-in-chief of the bandit army is Qi Wenping, a former subordinate of Shi Yousan. Under Qi, there are two armies: the commander of the First Army is Guo Yazhou, and the commander of the Second Army is Zhang Kuiyuan (aka "Old Mouse"). The headquarters of the First Army is located in Yu Guan Zhen, and the headquarters of the Second Army is located in Taitouying. Below each army, the system is chaotic and cannot be counted. There are those with three to five hundred people forming a division headquarters, and there are those with one hundred and eighty people forming a brigade headquarters. The number of bandits led by Guo Yazhou is around 2,000, and the number of bandits under Old Mouse is also no more than 3,000. The power is completely controlled by Qi Wenping. It is rumored that Old Mouse has secretly returned to Lu, and the Luan East bandits have no one to control them and are about to disintegrate. This is purely speculation, as Old Mouse still has Qi Wenping above him. There are two sources for all the bandits: one is those driven in from outside the customs, and the other is those recruited in various places. Those driven in from outside the customs are in the thousands, with complete firearms and difficult to tame bandit nature. Those recruited in various places are mostly unemployed soldiers. Anyone introduced by a bandit gang can go to the bandit army headquarters in Qinhuangdao to receive a rifle and 200 bullets. Once registered, they can act freely, and as for looting, raping, and whoring, they can do as they please. If they make a fortune by robbing and plundering, they can submit 200 yuan to the bandit army headquarters, and the rifles and bullets they received will belong to them. Now east of Changli, such as Liushouying, Beidaihe Seaside, Thai Royal Island, Yuguan Zhen, Taitouying, and Funing County, are all distribution points for the bandit army. East of Changli, they ride the train without paying tickets, acting like a formal army. As for the bandits fleeing to Funing, it was not initially expected that they could go straight down. Because our Third Security Brigade stationed in Funing had considerable strength. Even after the bandits surrounded the near Funing city, the security team still guarded around the city, waiting for reinforcements. However, there were traitors in the city, such as Hao Zuguoqin (the former puppet county magistrate), who attempted to use the power of the bandits to become county magistrate again. So, one side spread rumors in the city, saying that the security team had retreated, causing great panic among the people, who fled out of the west gate in droves. County Magistrate Liu Xingpei also believed it to be true and led his subordinates to flee to Changli overnight. At that time, the security team was still fighting on the front line when they suddenly heard that the rear was completely fleeing, and the rear communication agency was also cut off. Therefore, they had no choice but to retreat westward. The great Funing city was seized by the bandits. Deputy Team Leader Zhang of the security team was extremely saddened and angry, lamenting that all previous efforts had been wasted, and suddenly developed a nervous breakdown, crying and weeping every day, roaring and groaning, full of indignation. He has now been sent to Tianjin for treatment.</p>
<h3>Unprecedented Cruel Looting - Changli Also in Panic</h3>
<p>After the retreat from Funing, Hao Zuguoqin led the bandits into the city, believing that his personal desire to become an official could be fulfilled. Who knew that after the bandits entered the city, his dream of becoming county magistrate had not yet been realized, but the rape, looting, and burning of houses left the city's businesses looted. This lasted for five days, and the bandits were all heavily loaded with spoils. The bandit leaders Long Haiting, Bai Ziquan, and a certain foreign ronin, Guo Hongliang, even issued an announcement to reassure the people. At first, the people thought they could live in peace, but who knew that although sporadic looting by the bandits gradually decreased, the extortion of money followed one after another. The extortion by the bandits was unlimited. This group demanded money, and the next group followed. The people could not cope, and those who could escape had already escaped. Those who could not escape had no choice but to commit suicide to avoid being ravaged. At the beginning of October, Zuguoqin finally took office and appointed a large number of accomplices to take over the county's various agencies. They thought they had made contributions to the bandits, and after taking office, they sent people to pick up their families from Qinhuangdao to Funing. However, as soon as their families arrived at the city gate, they were detained and raped by the bandits. The retribution was immediately realized. After Funing was captured, Liushouying was also seized by the bandits. Therefore, Changli became the first line for the bandits to flee westward. People were terrified by the tragic looting in Funing, and they fled westward one after another. All businesses closed, schools suspended classes, and agencies stopped working. Fortunately, the Hebei Provincial Security Headquarters was located here, and the team leader, Dou Xizhe, had already set up strict defenses in the suburbs of the city, so Changli was fortunately spared.</p>
<h3>The Distribution of Traitors and the Hidden Dangers in Eastern Luan</h3>
<p>The Luan East bandit disaster is indeed the root of the current trouble, but it can still be suppressed. The most difficult thing to guard against is the traitors. Taking Changli as an example, traitors are everywhere and impossible to guard against. They use powerful people as a protective talisman, allowing them to do whatever they want, and no one dares to interfere. Their only base is the Japanese-owned White Noodle Restaurant. There are forty or fifty White Noodle Restaurants in Changli alone, where opium, heroin, and all kinds of deadly poisons can be found. There are also high-interest pawnshops that enslave the local people. The White Noodle Restaurants and pawnshops are disguised recruitment agencies for bandits. People addicted to drugs are bound to join the bandit gangs because once they become bandits, robbing and stealing are public actions that can solve their addiction. They can also seek refuge with the Japanese. Our local authorities cannot interfere with these illegal businesses, but must protect them, otherwise, the ronin will find excuses to cause various diplomatic problems. The reporter once climbed the Changli city wall and looked around. The red sun flags were densely lined up, almost making one think that they were in Japan, and could not help but shed tears. The only skill of the traitors is to scout the local situation for the bandits, spread rumors, and disturb the people. When necessary, they try to divide our forces to contain the rear. Therefore, the future hidden dangers in Eastern Luan are the evils committed by traitors, which are even worse than the current bandit disaster. The people in Eastern Luan have been ravaged twice, and the local economy has long been bankrupt. The Japanese have also set up high-interest pawnshops, with a term of only one month and interest as high as 80%, as a policy to seize our people's wealth. This is also a major concern for the future.</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Plans to Reform the Provincial and County Political Systems - Provincial Departments Combine Offices, County Administration Receives More Funding - Telegram Orders Eight Provincial Chairmen to Submit Opinions for Review</h3>
<p>According to a dispatch from Nanchang, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek believes that the current committee system of provincial departments has caused issues between the departments in processing documents and issuing orders, resulting in gaps, contradictions, duplication, and delays, which has become a common problem. Previously, while in Lushan, he telegraphed the bandit suppression provinces and regions to greatly reduce and merge the departments, save expenses, and allocate them to the county administration for use, in order to revitalize the county administration, which is directly related to the people, and improve administrative efficiency. After receiving the telegram, Chairman Zhang Qun of Hubei Province took the lead in implementing the combined office system and suggested to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek that if it were vigorously promoted, it would not only save expenses, but also achieve the effect of unified will and avoid the suffering of complicated government orders. Chiang, believing that the matter concerned reform and that its gains and losses should be further considered, telegraphed to study it in detail. Now, in order to gather wisdom and benefit, he specially telegraphed the provincial chairmen of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, Henan, Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces regarding the provincial government reform and the merger of departments, instructing them to sign their reform opinions for review, so that the reform could achieve the effect of governing. The telegrams from Chiang to the eight provincial chairmen are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Telegram 1</h3>
<p>The current committee system of the provincial government has been implemented for some time, and its drawbacks have been repeatedly seen, so it was suspended at the First National Political Conference. The drawbacks were listed at that time, and the Third Plenary Session also proposed changing to a governor system. Refreshing and improving are indeed urgent tasks. Recently, Chairman Zhang of Hubei telegraphed, in accordance with the order to reduce provincial redundant personnel and increase county administrative expenses, that the county administration is part of the provincial administration. If the provincial administration is not rectified, it is difficult to achieve the goal of refreshing the county administration. The current provincial system is fundamentally reformed, which cannot be completed overnight. For the sake of convenient implementation, the departments of the provincial government can first combine offices under the current system, and all documents will be issued in the name of the provincial government. The main items of each department shall be co-signed by the department director, so that the department director can face the competent department and the provincial government, and can face the counties and departments, eliminating all mutual correspondence and documents. According to this, personnel and expenses can be reduced by half. In the case of Hubei, the annual expenses of the provincial departments can be saved by more than 500,000 yuan, which is appropriate for half of the county administrative expenses of the entire province. If this system is implemented, the provincial government will have the effect of unified will, and the counties will not have the suffering of complicated government orders. The corners of the government will be increased, and emotions will be easily communicated. It is not just about saving expenses. It should also be used to address the fact that under the current provincial system, there are gaps, contradictions, duplication, and delays in the documents processed by the departments, which must be thoroughly reformed. Combined office work can correct this properly. However, the two provinces currently piloting this system have not yet seen significant results, and there are difficulties that should be considered in advance. For example, whether there is a public office in the provincial capital that can accommodate the provincial government and its departments in one place is a prerequisite. If not, it can only gather the heads of each department to the provincial government for duty, or all documents can only be received and distributed by the provincial government. In the former case, the departments of the provincial government are still operating separately, and their relationship is vague and unclear, just like the current relationship between the Military Affairs Commission and the military, staff, training, and council departments, which is not enough. In the latter case, after the departments collect and distribute documents, the chairman must review and approve them, and the director of the department must co-sign them. The energy and time of one person are limited, and it is doubtful whether they can cope with it comfortably. If it is carefully studied, there will be many accumulated problems and even delays in communication. If it is done hastily and agreed upon casually, the role of administrative supervision will be completely lost, and the chairman will not be able to stop or revoke any improper orders or punishments issued by the departments. The law should be clarified. Moreover, the government affairs of a province are intertwined with a department of the central government, which is very complicated. As a rule, the departments in the ministry, such as the agencies with more subordinate agencies, are allowed to issue department orders for the sake of convenient command, without having to ask the ministry for instructions before acting. Therefore, the department orders of each province may not be completely abolished. The situations of the civil affairs, finance, construction, and education departments in each department are also different. All these points should be properly planned and carefully considered before they can be implemented, and to avoid creating problems. Please reconsider and answer separately for review, etc. The matter concerns reform and should gather opinions and discuss it at length. You are all in charge of provincial administration and may have piloted the combined office system. Your understanding of its advantages and disadvantages must be very thorough. How should the above-mentioned difficulties be remedied, or are there other better ways to sweep away the current shortcomings of separation, contradiction, duplication, delay, redundancy, complexity, and superficiality? I hope that you will all conduct joint research and extensive investigation, sign and submit your responses separately for reference.</p>
<h3>Telegram 2</h3>
<p>[Administration is based on the county, from the central government to the provincial government. The implementation of all government orders and laws is based on the county. Therefore, the virtue of the county magistrate and the decline of county administration are related to the people's fortune and the country's governance. The current county administrative expenses in each province are, for example, in Hubei, 1,250 yuan per month for a first-class county, 950 yuan for a second-class county, and 850 yuan for a third-class county. Third-class counties account for the majority of the province, and the average number of documents received and sent by the county each month is more than 2,000. Hubei is like this, and other provinces are likely the same. With such a shortage of funds, the county magistrate cannot recruit talents to assist in management, and can only recruit mediocre people to muddle through. Not only will actual government affairs and local affairs lack assistance and fail to advance, but even if they devote themselves to dealing with the more than 2,000 documents each month, they are afraid that they will be too busy and difficult to complete. How can we blame virtuous people for shunning the position of county magistrate, while greedy and inferior people use it to plunder and exploit? All hundred neglects are inevitable. Therefore, in the future, if we want to improve administrative efficiency, we must first revitalize the county administration. To revitalize the county administration, we must first increase county administrative expenses and replenish its manpower. The finances of each province are difficult, and the budgets have all been determined. If we want to increase expenses, it will be difficult to raise funds. Now, in order to take into account the budget and still revitalize the county administration, we have formulated several guidelines as follows: (1) The provincial government and its departments still have many redundant personnel and superfluous agencies that have not been eliminated. We should reduce and merge them separately, strictly implement austerity, or make every effort to reduce expenses in other items that can be saved, in order to raise a sum of money from the original budget and increase the county administrative expenses by two-thirds of the current amount, or at least increase them by half of the original amount, so as to be sufficient and facilitate implementation. The provincial government and its subordinate agencies are originally responsible for directing and supervising. If we carefully select people and leave only a few, it will be sufficient to cope with the situation, and the work will be more focused and the spirit will be boosted. (2) The personnel reduced from the provincial government and its agencies can be re-examined and selected for their abilities and merits, and then assigned to the counties to assist in county administration, which will not only foster talents, but also benefit the local area. (3) The frequent changes in county magistrates and the lack of security, with the government office being equivalent to a post station, are also a reason for the failure of today's county administration. In the future, the term of office should be fixed for county magistrates who have completed their probationary period and whose performance is outstanding, so that they can stay in their posts for a long time and devote themselves to achieving results. (4) In provinces that have established administrative supervisory commissioners, the appointment and removal of county magistrates should be based on the assessment of the commissioners. All important government orders and announcements should be transferred through the commissioners' hands, relying on their ears and eyes, and clarifying the system. The commissioners can easily fulfill their duties of supervising, and the county magistrates can also be protected.</p>
<p>All of the above are the results of Zhongzheng's careful observation of the current malpractices and broad adoption of public opinions, after several considerations. If they can be conscientiously implemented, manpower and resources will be focused on the county. Virtuous and capable people will be inspired, and mediocre people will have no skills to deceive. All local government affairs can then be rectified, and it is expected that they will be successful. This is a major key to governing the country and saving the people. We earnestly hope that you will formulate concrete implementation methods in detail and telegraph us for review as soon as possible.] (October 11)</p>
<h3>Important Announcements of Officials in Various Departments of the Jiangsu Provincial Government; Gu Renfa Announces His Political Views; Cheng Tianfang Instructs Officials</h3>
<p>Following the assumption of office by the new department heads of the various departments and offices of the Jiangsu Provincial Government yesterday morning, with the exception of the Department of Finance, which has not yet announced its new officials, the Departments of Civil Affairs and Reconstruction have announced several important officials. These include: Wan Zong, Chief Secretary of the Department of Civil Affairs; Yang Yiru, Secretary; Cao Boquan, Chief Secretary of the Department of Reconstruction; Xiao Kai, Chief Technical Expert; Gu Jizhi, Secretary; Wu Shilin, Chief of the First Section; Xu Hengshou, Chief of the Third Section; and Zheng Yitong, He Zhongxiao, and Yao Yuanchu, Secretaries of the Secretariat; Wan Junmo, Chief of the First Section; Chen Yingkun, Chief of the Second Section. Gu Renfa, the Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, stated yesterday that politics is a holistic endeavor, and it is necessary to coordinate the overall situation and seek balanced development, without being biased. He further stated, "I have just arrived in Jiangsu Province, and I do not yet fully understand the situation. In the future, I will follow the Chairman, understand the actual needs, determine the administrative policies, and do my best to rectify the situation. As for the staff, as long as they are able to perform their duties honestly and abide by the law, those who are experienced should be given preference."</p>
<p>Cheng Tianfang, Secretary-General of the Provincial Government, convened the entire staff of the Secretariat for an initial meeting in the newly constructed building after the war. He delivered a brief speech, stating: "[Colleagues, the Chairman, due to his ongoing recovery, has asked me to meet with you all first. The Chairman and the committee members have been appointed by the Central Government to take office in Jiangsu. Today, I will first share the Chairman's intentions and my attitude with you. Both the Chairman and I share the premise of 'practical work.' In terms of personnel, we will absolutely use talent as the standard. As long as someone is capable, we will not easily replace experienced personnel with novices. However, there are two points I hope everyone will pay attention to: (1) A common problem of administrative organs is slow procedures and delayed documents. We must strive to correct this and work to be efficient. (2) The government establishes offices and assigns positions to have people responsible for handling affairs. However, personnel in the organs often shirk responsibility when faced with issues, delaying the progress of public administration. We must eliminate this practice. The Chairman and I strongly advocate for both of these points and will ensure their implementation. We will have ample time to discuss these matters in detail in the days to come." (October 13th)</p>
<h3>Songjiang: A Local Prostitute Injured in a Horse-Riding Accident is in Critical Condition</h3>
<p>In the towns of Songjiang and Kunshan and Shanghai, where the social atmosphere is open, young women from ordinary families have traditionally worked in sock factories to earn a living. Since the spread of war from north to south, the sock industry has been sluggish, and female workers have lost their jobs, leading them to a life of prostitution. As a result, pleasure-seeking men have flocked to the area. Recently, with the construction of the motor road, local prostitutes have taken to riding horses at full speed, disregarding the repeated warnings about the dangers of their reckless behavior. The County Executive Committee had previously proposed a meeting to request a strict prohibition. Yesterday, a local prostitute named Wang Meihua defied the ban and continued to ride her horse on the motor road. She fell and was seriously injured due to excessive speed. She was immediately sent to the Joseph Hospital for treatment and is reportedly in critical condition.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Establishment of a Long-Distance Bus Service to Mudu</h3>
<p>Mudu Township is the leading town in Wu County, with thriving commerce and convenient transportation. The Jiangsu Department of Construction has been building the Suzhou-Mudu Highway, which is expected to be completed within a few months. Now, Shi Junqing, Chairman of the County Chamber of Commerce, and others have initiated the organization of the Suzhou-Mudu Road Long-Distance Bus Company, led by Liu Fuqing. According to the measures for inviting merchants to undertake long-distance bus services, they submitted a report to the Jiangsu Department of Construction yesterday (the 13th) for record-keeping to facilitate the process. The capital is estimated to be around 100,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Lake Bandits Discovered in Luhu, Wujiang</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 13th), the Third District of the Water Police reported that seventy or eighty bandits from Chaohu and other mixed gangs were discovered near Luhu Town in Wujiang. They were fully armed and refused to leave, indicating a potential disturbance. After receiving the report, District Chief Wei dispatched the Peirong warship and four troop-carrying vessels at 3:00 PM to suppress them, and also telegraphed the Wujiang detachment to encircle and suppress them nearby. District Chief Wei, considering the recent unpredictable activities of the Taihu bandits, has scheduled a meeting on the 17th, gathering the captains of the Second and Third Districts and the guerrilla leaders to Suzhou for an anti-bandit conference.</p>
<h3>President Lin of the Court Pays Attention to Detained County Magistrates</h3>
<p>President Lin of the High Court, considering that during the tenure of Zhao Qi, the former Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, the county magistrates of Pixian (Peng Guoyan), Funing (Hong), and Xinghua (Zhen) were detained for more than a year without clear charges, in order to protect human rights and maintain the rule of law, sent another letter to the Provincial Government on the 13th, requesting that if these county magistrates are suspected of crimes, they should be sent to the court for handling in accordance with the law.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Organization of a Rural Improvement Association</h3>
<p>The County Party Headquarters of this county convened the sixth Party-Government Talk yesterday. The chairman, Xu Yongji, resolved the following important cases: (1) In response to the provincial order urging the organization of a County Rural Improvement Association, the County Party Headquarters, the County Government, and the Agricultural Extension Office should contact and appoint members to organize and carry out the work. (2) Regarding the inspection of vehicles of the Xicheng Long-Distance Bus Company, the County Government should order the Vehicle Management Office to handle it practically. As for the collection of road maintenance fees for this road, which was ordered to be transferred to the company, it has damaged the county's income and the management is also inconvenient. The County Government should request the Department of Construction to withdraw the order. (3) Urge the educational associations of each district to promptly report the list of members for review, in order to guide the re-election and establishment within a time limit. (4) The past employees of the Silk Industry Consolidation Association were owed living expenses. There is no record available to both the Party and the Government. Now that the Industry Consolidation Association has decided to provide 20%, it should be followed, and the old employees should not cause further disturbances.</p>
<h3>Police Chief Suspended for Gun Loss</h3>
<p>The armory of the Second Branch Bureau of the Public Security Bureau outside Guangfu Gate had three wooden-holstered guns and one Browning pistol, along with ten bullets, stolen on the 4th of this month. After the incident, Branch Bureau Chief Wang Xiezhong and Bureau Member Sun Zhongjie voluntarily requested punishment from the General Bureau. Director Wu suspended Wang and others first and appointed the Second Section Chief Cheng Xu to temporarily take over. Director Wang voluntarily set a one-week deadline to track down the perpetrators and recover the stolen items. Suspects Qiao Shoulang, Qiao Liu, Bai San, Xu Xiaogui, Wu Xu, and Qiu Jia and others were apprehended in Dongxin Road, along with Police Chief Zheng Yaoqing and Police Officer Yu Wenhao of the bureau. They were all transferred to the General Bureau for interrogation and detention by Director Wang. Yesterday, Director Wu, as the deadline had passed without any news of the perpetrators or the recovery of the stolen items, presented the detained police chief and others to the County Government for interrogation. At the same time, County Magistrate Yan Yu also summoned Wang Xiezhong to the county for formal suspension and, together with the Trial Division Chief Yao Fusheng, went to the Second Branch Bureau to inspect the firearms for verification.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin: Economic Pressure Leads to Self-Mutilation</h3>
<p>Xie Benrun, a resident outside Zhongshan Gate in the north of the city, who used to run a salted goods business at Liu Tongshun in the north of the city, now owns a Gongyuanxing straw shop in the west of the gate. Due to business losses, mounting debts, and difficult family circumstances, he has become paralyzed. Yesterday morning (the 12th), Xie Benrun used a razor to cut open his scrotum, causing both testicles to hang down. His life is in danger, and he was immediately treated by a doctor. His life is in danger.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang: New Regulations for Land in Jiangsu Province</h3>
<p>The chaos in land taxation in Jiangsu Province has reached an extreme. The disordered and lost fish-scale registers are a major cause, and the complex and confusing business certificates are also a main cause. Currently, the property certificates held by the public include red deeds, white deeds, square slips, small slips, Ministry of Finance licenses, Taiwan Camp Bureau licenses, and official seal slips issued by the recently established collection offices. The types are more than these, or there are none at all. With numerous names and a complete loss of standards, local tyrants and cunning officials take advantage of this to engage in fraud, encroachment, and occupation, causing a hundred evils. Nothing is more harmful to the country and the people than this. The Jiangsu Provincial Government, recognizing this, first established the Provincial Land Bureau, and each county established a County Land Bureau to conduct a thorough land survey and registration, and to implement thorough management. After the land has been surveyed and registered, the county bureau will issue new certificates, called land ownership certificates, which will detail the land parcel, boundary address, mu divisions, and terrain. There are also corresponding maps for verification. The design is detailed and the regulations are strict. The Jiangsu Provincial Government, in order to unify the powers and solemnly handle land administration, has resolved that from the 22nd year onwards, after the county land bureau issues ownership certificates within the registration area of each county, (1) land sales and transfers should be registered with the county land bureau and new certificates should be obtained, without having to go to the promotion office to handle the promotion and obtain official seal slips, (2) land mortgages and sales should be on official deed paper obtained from the County Land Bureau. Taxes should be paid to the financial authorities according to regulations, and then transfer should be applied for, (3) judicial organs should only consider the land ownership certificates issued by the County Land Bureau as valid when handling land cases. The order has been issued to the county governments to inform the public and to instruct all levels of judicial organs to comply.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou: Expansion of the Silk Industry Dispute</h3>
<p>Due to the strong capital and large scale of the newly opened Dasheng Silk Brocade Embroidery Shop in Yangzhou, the various silk industries believed that its opening would inevitably affect the business of their counterparts. They contacted the cloth, ready-to-wear, and Western-style clothing industries to jointly oppose it. After mediation by the Party and government organs, it was initially resolved. However, the silk industry laborers believed that the mediation was insufficient and, again, united with the other five industries to hold a meeting overnight, print declarations and leaflets. On the morning of the 12th, the labor side went on strike, and the management side closed their businesses. Each shop posted declarations, generally stating that they opposed the economic aggression of capitalists, opposed the manufacturers' monopoly of the market, the destruction of the public welfare of the six industries, and the endangering of the livelihoods of both labor and management. They distributed leaflets along the streets and gathered hundreds of people to the Silk Industry Association for a meeting, urging Dasheng to stop organizing and sending a letter to Chairman Wang of the Chamber of Commerce to ask for assistance, and also telegraphed the Ministry of Industry and the Jiangsu Provincial Government, asking them to prohibit Dasheng from organizing, not hesitating to make any sacrifices until the goal is achieved. At the same time, Dasheng's side expressed its firm determination to open on schedule, no matter what. The current Party and government authorities and the Chamber of Commerce are trying to mediate.</p>
<h3>Jiashan: Clash Between Police and Bandits in Jinze</h3>
<p>[Shenxiangdu, outside the Beizha of Lanzhen in the county, is a den of bandits. On the previous day (the 12th), eight bandit boats first robbed the account-collecting boat from Jiaxing Pass and then arbitrarily searched the civilian boat of a farmer named Yu in the east of the town.] Gao Zengzhi, the commander of the standing division of the Zha security regiment and the chief of the rapid reaction team, led 16 team members to encircle them. As a result of the fierce battle, 12 security regiment members died, commander Gao Zengzhi was injured and escaped by swimming, and the firearms and patrol boats were completely lost. Upon receiving the report, the county government urgently ordered Police Brigade Captain Wang Ji to lead the Yifa warship and all the security regiment members to the west, where they would meet with the Third District security regiment outside the national border. A telegram was sent to the Qingpu naval and land forces to request their joint suppression.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou: Central Aviation School Plane Crash Kills Farmer</h3>
<p>Liu, a student in the flying department of the Central Aviation School in Jianqiao, was flying an SP-one Hawker fighter plane at 3:30 PM on the 12th for flight training. When he flew to Qibao, the engine suddenly broke down, and the plane crashed into the cotton field near the Provincial Cotton Field. At that time, Yu Jinbao, a farmer from No. 8 Huji Pond in that area, was in a thatched shed he had built. The force of the plane crash crushed Yu's head and chest, causing serious injuries and immediate death. Yu's wife, Qiu, along with her four-year-old daughter, Afeng, and a newborn baby, were in the field. Seeing this, they were terrified and reported the incident to Ye Qixun, the patrol captain of the resident station of the Third Branch Bureau of the Public Security Bureau, who led officers to investigate and reported it to the court. The student who crashed the plane was not injured and went back to the school to report. The school sent mechanics and a cover team of ten people to dismantle the damaged plane for repair. Lu Xiusong, the director of the seventh district, stated that the deceased had rented land to plant cotton, and this year's harvest was very small. In addition to his wife and three daughters in Hangzhou, he also had grandmothers and mothers aged 79 and 66 in his hometown of Xiaoshan, who relied on him for a living. He went to the Aviation School to request generous compensation. Yesterday (the 13th) at 2:00 PM, the Hangzhou District Court sent inspector Zhao Xiang to inspect the body. The funeral was held that evening. Yu's family was impoverished, and the coffin and clothes were provided by the district office. The wife and children cried, and the situation was very tragic. It is reported that of the eighteen Hawker planes purchased from abroad, two were damaged in the Qiantang River a month ago, and another was destroyed in December, for a total of three. According to sources close to the Aviation School, the actual number of damaged planes is even higher.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Finance Seeks Loans from Banks; Total Amount is Half of the Remaining Treasury Bonds; Negotiations Successful but Funds Not Yet Released</h3>
<p>Xinsheng News Agency reports that the Ministry of Finance, due to the wartime situation in North China, temporarily borrowed approximately 70 million yuan from the banking sector and issued 100 million yuan in customs treasury bonds of the Republic of China's 22nd year to repay the loans to the banks. The new treasury bonds have now been printed. Before the new treasury bonds were printed, the Ministry of Finance issued pre-subscription certificates to the banks, which will be exchanged for the new treasury bonds after they are printed. As for the above-mentioned temporary loans, it is said that the Central Bank had the most, about 40 million yuan, and more than 20 banks, including the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, had about nearly 30 million yuan, for a total of about 70 million yuan. However, even though the debt has been settled, the monthly military and administrative expenses are still severely insufficient, and there is still a feeling of helplessness. After Finance Minister Song Ziwen came to Shanghai, he further negotiated new loans with the banking sector, using the remaining amount of the new treasury bonds as collateral. The amount of the new loans is half of the amount of the treasury bonds, and the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and other banks are responsible for it. It is reported that the negotiations have been successful, but the funds have not yet been released to the Ministry of Finance due to incomplete procedures.</p>
<h3>Cotton Industry Control Committee to be Established on the 16th; Temporary Office Moved to New Location Yesterday</h3>
<p>The National Economic Council's Cotton Industry Control Committee, after the National Government clearly announced the appointment of Chen Guangfu, Li Shenbo, Xie Zuokai, Tang Xinghai, Zou Qiuwen, Chen Lifu, Rong Zongjing, Zhang Gongquan, Du Yuesheng, Bei Songsun, Zhang Xiaolin, Guo Shun, He Bingxian, Hu Yunan, Liu Yinfei, Sun Enlin, Wu Xingya, Nie Yunsheng, Mu Xiangyue, Chen Bozhuang, and Li Haoju as committee members, and designated Chen Guangfu as the chairman, Chen held a meeting of the Shanghai-based committee members at the Shanghai Bank on October 7 to discuss important issues such as the division of work, and decided to rent the sixth floor of the Dalu Building on Yima Road as the office address. It is reported that the various procedures have been actively prepared and are now in order. It has now been decided that the official establishment will take place on the 16th of this month, and a grand ceremony will be held. The temporary office attached to the Shanghai Bank Building was moved to the new office address for work yesterday. It is also reported that Sun Enlin and Feng Zefang, cotton industry experts sent by the committee to Shaanxi, Shandong, Hubei, and Hunan to investigate cotton production, have completed their tasks and will return to Shanghai within days to attend the founding meeting and report on their inspection.</p>
<h3>Reasons for the Non-Flight of the Eurasia Aircraft to Dihua; Turmoil in Xinjiang Province; Luo Wen'gan Changes Route to Return to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Xinsheng News Agency reports that, according to reliable sources, since Ma Zhongying and Sheng Shicai fell out again in Xinjiang, the turmoil in the new province has become increasingly serious. The New Provincial Government ordered the Eurasia Airlines aircraft not to fly to Dihua again. As a result, the plane, which was scheduled to depart next Tuesday, has been changed to fly to Suzhou. Foreign Minister Luo Wen'gan's inspection of Xinjiang will not be possible due to the turmoil in Southern Xinjiang. He will probably return to Shanghai via Siberia. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Staff of the Pinghan Railway Donate Three "Pinghan" Aircraft; Raising 210,000 Yuan; Telegraphing the Aviation Association to Select and Purchase</h3>
<p>Since the Aviation Association promoted aviation to save the country, people from all walks of life across the country, recognizing the importance of air defense, have competed to order aircraft and donate them to the government to strengthen national defense. The staff of the Pinghan Railway have also donated 210,000 yuan and telegraphed the Aviation Association to select and purchase three "Pinghan" aircraft to donate to the government, which is truly commendable. The original telegram is as follows: To Secretary-General Lin of the National Aviation Association: May I relay to the directors and supervisors, your association is in charge of the national aviation rescue movement, planning great strategies, and being a pioneer for the people. You are especially able to coordinate matters regarding the selection and purchase of aircraft. Your reputation has spread far and wide, and the entire country admires you. Since the establishment of this association, the total amount of donations from employees throughout the road has reached 210,000 yuan in foreign currency. In order to unify the machinery, facilitate its use, and for future repairs, we would like to ask your association to select and purchase three Pinghan No. 1, 2, and 3 aircraft at a price of 70,000 yuan each, according to our country's current needs, and donate them to the government for use. If you agree, please telegraph the Aviation Department to order them and reply. The National Air Force Founding Association of the Pinghan Railway, respectfully.</p>
<h3>Serious Turmoil</h3>
<p>Since Sheng Shicai declared the suppression of Ma Zhongying in Xinjiang, Ma immediately sent troops to attack the provincial capital, in order to gain the upper hand. The turmoil has lasted for more than ten days. At the same time, on the Southern Xinjiang side, Sheng Shicai sent troops to Southern Xinjiang in order to avoid being surrounded by Ma Zhongying, which has caused disturbances in Southern Xinjiang. However, according to people familiar with Xinjiang, Ma Zhongying has not contacted Ni Shhezi, the leader of the Hui Muslims in Southern Xinjiang, because Ma and Ni have very different opinions. The turmoil in Xinjiang is becoming increasingly serious. The authorities have recently forced Eurasia Airlines aircraft to stop carrying passengers or flying empty to Dihua, otherwise they will be detained.</p>
<h3>Change of Flight to Suzhou</h3>
<p>After the Xinsheng News Agency reporter obtained the report that Xinjiang had stopped Eurasia aircraft from going to Dihua yesterday, he went to inquire with Li Jingzong, the manager of Eurasia Airlines. Li confirmed the above news, saying that he had received a telegram from the Dihua Eurasia Aviation Station, which was a notification from the Xinjiang authorities to the branch station there, not a direct telegram. Currently, the company has decided to have the Eurasia aircraft, which is scheduled to depart from Shanghai next Tuesday to fly to Dihua, still depart as scheduled, but change its flight to Suzhou in Gansu. The entire Xinjiang territory, including Hami, will be suspended. It will resume only after obtaining the authorities' permission.</p>
<h3>Luo, the Foreign Minister, Changes Route</h3>
<p>According to diplomatic sources, Foreign Minister Luo Wen'gan, after meeting with our country's Ambassador to Russia, Dr. Yan Huiqing, on the Soviet border, has now returned to Tacheng. Due to the turmoil in Southern Xinjiang, he may not visit. Since Eurasia aircraft can no longer directly reach Dihua, Luo's return route must be changed. He will probably return to Shanghai via Siberia, as reported in the previous telegram.</p>
<h3>Japanese Going to Xinjiang</h3>
<p>Previously, two Japanese citizens chartered a Eurasia Airlines aircraft to go to Dihua and were stopped in Suzhou, which has attracted the attention of people from all walks of life in the country. Every move of the Japanese in China has a conspiracy attempt, and these two Japanese who went to Xinjiang are both military personnel of the Japanese army, so their actions are even more worthy of our attention. Now, the Xinsheng News Agency reporter has learned that the purpose of these two people going to Xinjiang is not to help the entangled rebels in Xinjiang. The authorities admitted that their trip to Xinjiang was introduced by people from the government, so the Eurasia Company authorities could not refuse their trip to the Northwest under the guise of excuse. Moreover, if they had a conspiracy to help the entangled rebels, then the so-called government introducers would never have introduced them to go there. As for what mission they have, there is still no way to know for sure, but according to the speculation of those who studied in Japan with Sheng Shicai, the governor of Xinjiang, it is feared that Sheng specifically telegraphed them to go to Xinjiang to serve as consultants because he was fighting with Ma Zhongying and others in Xinjiang. Because they were stopped in Gansu, it is also possible that the reason why Eurasia aircraft were restricted from flying to Dihua by Xinjiang this time was because the aircraft did not carry two Japanese soldiers to Xinjiang. However, it can be said that Eurasia aircraft were definitely not stopped because of the war, because Eurasia aircraft have never been affected by the war in Xinjiang, which has lasted for many years. This time, it can also be asserted that it is not because of the war. As for the two Japanese military personnel themselves, it is feared that they also inevitably have the mission of attempting to make the Xinjiang Hui people independent and inspecting British and Russian forces in Xinjiang. It is still difficult to say whether the above observations are reliable, but there are many credible points, so I will record them to await verification.</p>
<h3>Miao Zhongxiu Speaks on the Foreign Trade of Chinese Silk; Invited by the International Problems Research Association</h3>
<p>The International Problems Research Association held a tea party for its members at the Banking Club at 5:00 PM yesterday. They specially invited Miao Zhongxiu, director of the Raw Silk Department of the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, to speak on the problems of Chinese silk's foreign trade. Miao had previously gone to the United States to investigate raw silk and had only recently returned to Shanghai last month. He has an in-depth study of various aspects of raw silk. The following is a record of his speech:</p>
<h3>Comparison of Chinese and Japanese Silk Sales in the United States</h3>
<p>According to last year's statistics, China's national raw silk exports were worth more than 50 million yuan, accounting for approximately ____ percent of the total national foreign trade. The Japanese have already recognized the importance of the silk industry. Now, let's compare it with Japan's foreign trade in raw silk. Japan's annual exports are worth more than 430 million yuan in Chinese currency, while the total value of China's silk trade is only slightly more than one-tenth of that of Japan. To analyze it further, the United States is the largest consumer of raw silk, with annual raw silk imports worth more than 440 million yuan in Chinese currency. Japanese raw silk accounts for 410 million yuan, while Chinese raw silk accounts for only 15 million yuan, which is less than 5% of the total amount of imports in the United States. Therefore, when comparing the trade in raw silk between China and the United States, we realize the importance of the silk industry and its value for research and development. Furthermore, judging from the statistics on the quantity of foreign trade in raw silk between China and Japan in the past three years, China's national raw silk exports have decreased from 135,000 bales to 72,000 bales from 1930 to 1932, a decrease of nearly 50%, while Japan has increased from 473,000 bales to 540,000 bales during these three years. The rise and fall of foreign trade in raw silk between China and Japan has been reversed, which is heartbreaking. We realize the seriousness of China's silk party problem and the urgency of research and improvement.</p>
<h3>Effective Promotion of Rayon</h3>
<p>The American silk weaving industry made great strides during the ____ war, and became the country with the largest consumption of raw silk in the world, accounting for 60% of the world's production. Before 1929, each weaving factory competed to produce products, and there was already an oversupply. After the sudden increase in the number of 129 silk fabrics piled up in the market and the thin purchasing power of the people, the oversupply became more obvious, the value of silk fabrics became lower, and the silk industry suffered a major blow. However, it gradually recovered soon. There have been many changes in silk weaving factories in recent years, but the total amount of raw silk consumed by the entire group is still more than 550,000 bales. Recently, after the government implemented the recovery movement, stores feared that prices would rise sharply and rushed to place orders. Therefore, in June and July, each factory became more active, like the prosperity of 1929. Unfortunately, after the stores placed many orders, it is not certain whether they can sell them. In the past two months, silk prices have fallen sharply, and only 35,000 bales of raw silk were sold in September, while there were as many as 75,000 bales of silk in stock, which cannot be said to be the reaction to the boom in June and July. Rayon is encroaching on the silk industry more and more every day. Seven-tenths of the raw materials in American silk factories are rayon, but ____ factories are still luckily preserved. The success of rayon in the United States was initially due to the effective promotion of officials, and then due to the people's economic exhaustion and inability to ____ buy real silk fabrics. Its promotion method is to have groups design rayon fabrics into clothes for the same industry and display them in public places to arouse the interest of ladies. After the manufacturers sell the goods, they send technicians to guide them, so in the past two years, each silk factory has been happy to use them. Since the purchasing power of people in various countries has decreased, women only seek beautiful and cheap clothes, regardless of whether the raw materials are real silk or rayon. Manufacturers only seek products that are easy to sell and profitable, regardless of whether the raw materials of their woven fabrics are real silk or rayon, and it is technically easier to use rayon than natural silk. However, the changes made by rayon not only affect the silk industry, but also the cotton and wool weaving industries. However, natural real silk has its own inimitable characteristics, which cannot be completely replaced by rayon.</p>
<h3>Reasons for the Failure of Chinese Silk Sales in America</h3>
<p>Although there have been several Chinese merchants engaged in the business of raw silk for several years, they all entrust foreigners to represent their sales, rather than directly promoting their products overseas. As a result, they have no way of knowing whether the sales are effective, or whether the buyers have sufficient financial capacity. Once affected by market pressure, they all shut down their businesses. Today, the only independent operator is Tongyun Company. Entrusting the sales of Chinese silk to ordinary importers not only makes it impossible to clearly understand the progress and needs of the American silk weaving industry, but also makes the sales ineffective. For example, if a certain factory's importer or broker purchases a certain amount of Chinese silk, these importers or brokers often replace it with Japanese silk without even bothering to collect the Chinese silk, in order to complete the transaction. Nowadays, the promotion of raw silk has become a specialized service, and cannot be treated the same as the sale of other ordinary commodities. Here is an example: several years ago, a factory in Massachusetts purchased a bale of Chinese silk. After testing it, the quality was found to be unsuitable for their needs. For several years, they were reluctant to use Chinese silk. Recently, after a certain Chinese silk factory sent personnel to promote their products, the factory has completely switched to using Chinese silk. To promote raw silk, it is necessary to first understand the needs of the buyers, and especially to ensure that the buyers have deep trust in the quality. Then, one should offer the silk and ensure a continuous supply of goods for their use.</p>
<h3>Need to Prepare Spot Goods and Maintain Uniformity</h3>
<p>Since being hit by market pressures, the financial capacity of American silk mills has been very weak, making it impossible to order futures. Moreover, since the government implemented the recovery policy, the changes in the silk weaving industry have been uncertain, making it impossible to schedule the raw materials needed in advance. Sales are not as high as in previous years, while Japanese silk is stocked in the market and can be purchased at any time. Even if the futures do not meet the requirements, they can be exchanged at any time. However, if Chinese silk does not meet the requirements, there is no solution other than to sell it at a discount. The price level should also be carefully considered. If the selling price is too high, sock factories will produce lower-quality products for the American market. Furthermore, it cannot be priced equally with Japanese silk of the same grade. The most unsuitable characteristic of Chinese silk is that it is not reeled directly. The second most important factor is uniformity. Chinese silk is divided into very fine grades, and buyers pay attention to uniformity. It is hoped that those who are involved in producing silk will pay special attention to this and never reduce costs by using silk with a large group count, as this will lose the special quality of Chinese silk.</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu's Wishes for Developing a Greater Shanghai Addressed to the Rotary Club of Shanghai, Hoping for the Assistance of Chinese and Foreign Individuals</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Rotary Club hosted a banquet in the Capital Hotel on Jiangxi Road for the Mayor of Shanghai, Wu Tiecheng. In addition to the Director of the Public Security Bureau, Wen Hongen, the Director of the Public Works Bureau, Xu Peihuang, and the Secretary of the Municipal Government, Tang Shixuan, were invited to attend, there were also approximately one hundred and twenty members of the club, as well as dozens of leaders from various Chinese and Western sectors. A record of Mayor Wu's speech is provided below. Greetings, President, fellow members, and guests. I am deeply honored by the kind invitation of your esteemed club to this "Greater Shanghai" gathering. Not only am I personally grateful, but the entire city of Shanghai shares in this honor. To have such a distinguished organization as yours specifically set a date to celebrate is truly touching. As the Mayor, I am responsible for ensuring the prosperity of this city. The prosperity of Shanghai is the linchpin of China's peace and prosperity. As China prospers, its immense purchasing power, vast international market, and the opportunity to employ foreign experts will directly and indirectly benefit the economic recovery of European and American countries. To achieve prosperity, Shanghai must become a safe commercial port, free from the distress of internal and external disturbances. Therefore, eliminating domestic turmoil and hoping that friendly nations will respect international peace treaties is of utmost urgency. The increase in wealth and rapid progress of the people are often symbols of the development and prosperity of a city. In recent years, except for the tragic events of a few months last year, Shanghai's population and wealth have increased significantly. However, can we say that its industry and commerce have developed soundly? Not yet, and it is far from being sound. What is the reason for this? The main cause is that the neighboring provinces in the interior have suffered from Communist bandits for years, causing rural bankruptcy. Wealthy families have flocked to Shanghai with their treasures, seeking safety, while poor farmers, unable to make a living, have also come here to seek solutions. With neighboring areas trapped in chaos and the people impoverished, it has affected Shanghai, and its industry and commerce have been unable to develop properly. Shanghai is like a fish, and the interior is like a fishpond. A Chinese proverb says, "A dried-up pond has no fish," because fish cannot live without water. The concentration of wealth without knowing how to circulate it is not a sign of prosperity. The increase in population and the growing number of unemployed people are signs of urban life's illness. If one wants the fish to grow, but does not first fill the pond with water, how can it be achieved? The Chinese government is doing its best to suppress the Communist bandits and restore peace and order, to revitalize the disaster areas, and to first allow the farmers to return to their land and engage in cultivation, and especially to provide them with assistance and convenience. This depends on the support of all sectors, and especially on the banking and financial sectors, to ensure the flow of finance to production, so that both investors and borrowers will share in the benefits. After the revival of the rural areas in the interior, if there are no foreign invasions, then Shanghai can be expected to advance to a golden era, so that everyone can benefit. The prosperity of Shanghai is crucial to China's progress, and China's progress can expand the international trade market, increase the opportunities for foreign experts, gradually eliminate the economic downturn, and contribute to the recovery of the world economy. As mentioned above, if everyone present can provide as much assistance as possible to industry and commerce to enable this great metropolis of China to achieve its ideal utopia, or at least maintain it as a safe area for seeking happiness and legitimate business, eliminating domestic disasters and hoping that the world will adhere to peace treaties, so that the world can enter a bright future, this is what I, Tiecheng, deeply hope for. I am grateful for your hospitality, and thank you for your kindness.</p>
<h3>Methods to Remedy the Future of Chinese Silk</h3>
<p>The silk industry has failed for years, and most people in the industry find it difficult to maintain their businesses, let alone improve them. Outsiders see it as a daunting task and are reluctant to invest. Therefore, in terms of the silk industry itself, improvement is very difficult. Last year, the government provided relief and barely managed to sell the old silk to overcome this difficulty. This year, the cost of spring cocoons was more than 800 yuan, while the current price of American silk is only 650 yuan, a difference of more than 100 yuan, which has led to sluggish sales. In general, silk factories are again on the verge of crisis. To remedy this situation, efforts should be made simultaneously in the three aspects of sericulture, silk reeling, and trade. The central and local governments have commissioned methods for sericulture and silk reeling and are actively carrying them out. In terms of trade, in my humble opinion, the government and merchants should jointly establish a direct sales organization to ship spot goods and sell them directly to foreign silk mills to expand sales and alleviate accumulated difficulties.</p>
<h3>Arrest of Korean Revolutionary Party Member Lee Seong-gu Cooperative Arrest by Japanese Police and French Concession Police Will be Sent to Nagasaki for Trial Soon</h3>
<p>Lee Seong-gu (also known as Lee Soo-bong), an important figure in the Korean revolutionary movement, was suddenly arrested at 10:00 AM on the 12th in the French Concession by detectives from the Japanese Consulate General, together with personnel from the French Concession Police. He has now been extradited to the Japanese Consulate. At the time, the Japanese Consul considered the case important and requested that the French Concession Police not make an official announcement. However, according to Korean residents, although Lee is Korean, he has long been a citizen of China, so it is necessary to disclose this information. Details are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Revolutionary Movement</h3>
<p>Lee Seong-gu (also known as Lee Soo-bong) is 37 years old and comes from Jiamul Nam-dong, Sookcheong-myeon, Seoncheon-gun, Pyeonganbuk-do, Korea. He is honest by nature and has great ambitions. He usually mourns the fall of his motherland and is angered by the arrogance of the enemy. Since childhood, he has been engaged in the revolutionary movement, fleeing overseas and working hard to save the country for more than ten years. The Japanese government deeply hates and despises him. Lee came to Shanghai in 1923 and resided in the French Concession.</p>
<h3>Circumstances of Arrest</h3>
<p>Recently, the Special Police Department of the Japanese Consulate General suddenly discovered Lee's residence in the French Concession. The residence was a Chinese house. On the morning of the 12th, the special section chief, Saeki, led the police chief, Fujii, the patrol chief, Goto, and ten armed Japanese policemen in three cars to the French Concession Police to request assistance. The French Concession Police dispatched many personnel to assist the Japanese police to Lee's residence. Lee was arrested on the spot and taken to the police station. After a brief interrogation by the police chief, Lee was handed over to the Japanese side.</p>
<h3>Japanese Accusations</h3>
<p>According to the Japanese Consulate Police Department, which announced the arrest of Lee, in recent months, assassination attempts of Koreans in Shanghai have occurred frequently. At the same time, the activities of the Korean Youth Independence Party have become more intense. The Japanese Police Department immediately conducted a thorough investigation and discovered that Lee was a major suspect. According to the investigation, Lee committed arson 11 years ago and was sentenced to ten years of hard labor. However, the sentence was suspended due to a serious illness and he was released. Later, in 1926, Lee threw bombs twice to destroy the Japanese Consulate General. The attempt failed and he fled. The Japanese Consulate General issued an arrest warrant for a long time, but he was not caught. Until recently, he secretly came to Shanghai to engage in conspiracies and plans, so he was arrested. It was said that Lee's case was important and he would be sent to Nagasaki for trial soon.</p>
<h3>Korean Residents' Rescue Efforts</h3>
<p>A Korean resident said last night that although Lee is Korean, he has long been a citizen of the Republic of China. They are currently checking his naturalization certificate and clarifying the matter to the National Government in an effort to rescue him.</p>
<h3>Party Split</h3>
<p>According to the Hualian News Agency on the 13th in this city, Lee Soo-bong, the leader of the Korean Independence Party, was arrested in the French Concession at 10:00 AM yesterday. Lee is from Jiamul Nam-dong, Sookcheong-myeon, Seoncheon-gun, Pyeonganbuk-do, and his real name is Lee Ah-gu. He is 37 years old this year. Since coming to Shanghai in 1923, he has worked hard to promote Korean independence for 12 years. The Japanese claimed that the bombing and assassination cases since 1926, as well as the recent assassination of pro-Japanese Koreans, were all led by Lee. This time, the Korean Independence Party was divided into two factions. Those from South Korea tend to be pro-Japanese, while those from North Korea are more radical. Lee belongs to the North Korean faction and was betrayed by the South Koreans. It is reported that the Japanese police dispatched Deputy Consul Saeki and a team of police officers in three cars to the French Concession Police to arrest him yesterday.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Communications' Periodic Examination of Seamen to be Held in Beijing The Marine Engineers Association Requests Emphasis on Experience Approved by the Ministry for Consideration</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Communications believes that the safety of passengers and goods is closely related to the qualifications of crew members such as marine engineers and helmsmen and cannot be ignored. Therefore, the Ministry is conducting examinations for all personnel applying for certificates. Previously, the Shanghai Chinese Marine Engineers Association requested that the date and location of the examination be changed and that more emphasis be placed on experience. The Ministry has replied separately, setting the date for the examination as the 24th of this month in Beijing and stipulating the subjects and regulations. The Shanghai Maritime Bureau has instructed all crew members to comply. The crew members are now preparing to take the examination. The details are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Two Instructions from the Ministry of Communications</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Communications yesterday instructed the Chinese Marine Engineers Association: "Your submission regarding the new examination subjects listed in the Provisional Regulations for the Examination of Seamen, which places too much emphasis on academic subjects, should be revised to benefit the shipping industry and encourage marine engineering talents. Your opinions are approved for consideration." This instruction also rejected the request to change the date and location: "Your submission requesting a change in the date and location of the seamen's examination to facilitate the examination is received. The examination locations and dates for all seamen taking the examination have been approved separately and announced in the newspaper. The request to change the date and location is not approved. Please be informed."</p>
<h3>Announcement from the Ministry of Communications</h3>
<p>The original text of the announcement from the Ministry of Communications regarding the periodic examination of seamen reads: "All seamen who have applied to the Ministry for certificates since June 1, 1933, and who are deemed by the Ministry's Seamen Examination Committee to be required to take the examination, are to report to the Ministry's auditorium in the capital at 9:00 AM on October 24, 1933, to await the examination. In addition to the Ministry's separate instructions, this announcement is hereby issued for your information."</p>

<h3>The Guizhou Fellow Townsmen in Shanghai Organize a Support Association After the Tragedy of the Shooting of Students in Guiyang Issue a Declaration Denouncing the Atrocities of the Warlords Send Telegrams of Condolence to the Bereaved Families and Injured Students</h3>
<p>After receiving news of the "September 18th Tragedy" in Guizhou, people from all walks of life in Guizhou in Shanghai and students from various schools in Shanghai with Guizhou origins were extremely indignant that the authorities oppressed the patriotic movement and massacred patriotic youth. They initiated the organization of a support association, and the preparatory meeting was established at 79 Beidang Road the day before yesterday to provide vigorous assistance to this tragedy. Those who attended the meeting that day included Guizhou students from various schools such as Datong, Fudan, Zhonggong, Minzhi News, Meizhuan Pudong, Jinan, Daxia, and the Wireless Telegraphy Institute, as well as dozens of people from all walks of life in Guizhou staying in Shanghai. The meeting was chaired by Cheng Bicheng, and it was resolved to organize a support association, send telegrams of condolence to the students in Guiyang, and issue a declaration. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Chairman's Report</h3>
<p>After the meeting was formally opened, Chairman Cheng Bicheng reported on the tragedy, stating that in the days leading up to September 18th, students throughout Guiyang were preparing for parades and speeches to commemorate the "September 18th Incident," but they were stopped by the local military police inspection office. However, the students believed that this kind of action was purely patriotic and did not accept the interference of the authorities. Therefore, on September 18th, they lined up to march and gather to depart, but were immediately suppressed by the military police. Because there were so many people, the military police could not suppress them, so they used a large number of cars to crash into the marching crowds, hoping to disperse the marching ranks. They also shot and stabbed with knives, resulting in the deaths of Zhao Shuying, Chen Peizhen, and others, and the injury of more than 40 people. The masses were indignant and went to the provincial government to petition and make demands: (1) Hand over the murderers, (2) Hand over the person in charge of the military police inspection office, (3) Guarantee that such incidents will not happen again in the future and protect all patriotic movements. But in the end, no answer was received. They also went to the Education Department to petition, but also did not receive a satisfactory reply, etc.</p>
<h3>Resolutions Passed</h3>
<p>The next meeting was held to discuss the methods, and it was resolved to: (1) Organize a support association, (2) Issue a declaration by the support association to inform all sectors inside and outside the province, (3) Solicit Guizhou people living abroad to participate in assistance, (4) Send a telegram of condolence to the students in the provincial capital, expressing that the fellow villagers living abroad deeply sympathize with your patriotic enthusiasm and are indignant that you have been unfortunately oppressed. A support association is now being organized to provide vigorous assistance, and send a telegram of condolence to the bereaved and injured students.</p>

<h3>Li Changlong Reports on the Tragic Situation of the Heze Flood Disaster</h3>
<p>According to Li Jun Changlong, the director of the Heze County Relief Office, the areas most severely affected by the disaster in Heze County are the five townships of Shufeng, Xihe, Yiju, Linhe, and Dehua. The next most severely affected are the seven townships of Tonghe, Pingling, Xincheng, Baozhong, Yonghe, Qianyuan, and Yongshui. The five townships of Yisheng, Xunde, Changming, Qingqiu, and Liming are also affected. In the five most severely affected townships such as Gangfeng, all the houses have collapsed and been completely destroyed, and the livestock and property have all been swept away by the flood. Now that the flood has receded, all the houses are empty. The people are sitting and lying along the embankment, without clothes or food. It is truly a rare human tragedy. An investigation was conducted in the villages within days, and because the disaster was widespread and the funds were limited, it was decided to select the twelve most severely and severely affected townships to release emergency relief. Now that the weather is getting cold, the disaster victims have thin clothes. Five thousand sets of new men's and women's cotton clothes have been made, with large sizes and thick cotton padding. Both men's and women's clothes are made with large collars for timely distribution. Also, because there have been many cases of fatigue recently, medicines are urgently needed. The association has delivered 3,600 bottles of Jisheng pills by mail, which will be distributed by Director Long at any time.</p>

It is reported that he will leave Shanghai on the 20th.</p>

<h3>Finance Ministry Approves Continued Collection of Brick and Tile Business Tax from Municipal Chambers of Commerce</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance telegraphed the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating: "The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce's review notes that Jiangsu Province intends to implement a business tax on the lime, brick, and tile kiln industries and to establish a bureau for its collection. The Chamber has repeatedly telegraphed requesting the abolition of such measures. The Ministry considers that the establishment of a special tax committee for the lime, brick, and tile kiln industries is inconsistent with the provisions of the Business Tax Law and has repeatedly ordered the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance to investigate and rectify the matter, with separate instructions issued and recorded. Now, based on the Jiangsu Provincial Government's report submitted by the Department of Finance, Commissioner Wu Xinchen of the Jiangsu Province Lime, Brick, and Tile Kiln Industry Business Tax, due to illness, has requested resignation, which has been approved. Furthermore, the position of commissioner has been abolished, merging it into the original business tax bureaus, continuing to collect taxes according to past regulations on manufacturing and sales respectively. This is for your information and implementation."</p>

<p>Jiading County Chamber of Commerce and others telegraph accusations against Public Security Bureau Chief Yang Heseng</p>
<p>A new agency reports: "The Jiading County Public Security Bureau Chief Yang Heseng has been ordered to take up the position of Public Security Bureau Chief of Qidong. However, various public organizations in Jiading County, citing Yang's numerous misdeeds during his tenure, have jointly requested the Jiangsu Provincial Government to severely punish him.</p>
<p>Repeat:" To the esteemed Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government and Director of the Department of Civil Affairs: Public Security Bureau Chief Yang Heseng of this county has been acting improperly, characterized by greed and shamelessness. Since taking office, he has imposed harsh penalties in cases, committing many misdeeds, leading to the ruin of the police administration and the collapse of discipline. On August 26th, the Second Branch Bureau of Public Security falsely accused a good citizen, Li Shouqi, of theft, using cruel torture to extract a confession, resulting in severe injuries that led to death. Afterwards, Yang Heseng ordered the head of the branch bureau, Jin Jishan, to retroactively file a leave application to cover up the guilt of the branch bureau head by replacing pages and removing staples from the General Bureau's document receipt book. The County Government retrieved the document receipt book and discovered the flaws.</p>
<p>The General Bureau of Public Security recently seized a large quantity of opium, seven bags, outside the East Gate, but privately released it. At the same time, Inspector Liu Rongxiang was sent to Shanghai to negotiate terms with the opium dealers. The inspector, Liu Rongxiang, was found in a house in the International Settlement and is still detained in the police station. Even more shocking, police officers Tao Dexing, Xiu Bingqing, and newly recruited police officer Zhao Bianhuan (the aforementioned police officer still resides at the bureau), colluded to commit theft, openly robbing stores. These police officers, on the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival according to the lunar calendar, at 9:00 PM, went to the Tian Yi Tang pharmacy located six li outside the South Gate in Shigangmen, claiming to buy medicine, using handguns and sharp blades to threaten and rob, stabbing the owner, obtaining over 160 yuan and four pieces of gold jewelry. That night, they returned to the bureau and divided the loot. The owner immediately reported the incident to the General Bureau of Public Security via telephone. However, the bureau seemed to be protecting them and ignored the report. The next day, the police team was informed, and Captain Gao Baozhen investigated and found the facts to be true. Only when the Public Security Bureau was questioned, were the police officers removed from their posts for interrogation. The owner identified them, and they confessed without hesitation. Both the robbers and the stolen goods were recovered and have been turned over to the judicial authorities for prosecution. The Public Security Bureau is supposed to be the only organization maintaining public order and protecting the people. Yang Heseng's improper conduct and the complete breakdown of discipline are such that it is no surprise that his subordinates are committing theft. These police officers committed heinous crimes and should be severely punished. However, Yang Heseng's shielding of his subordinates, using cruel torture leading to death, privately releasing opium cases, seeking bribes, and even allowing the police officers to commit theft and openly divide the loot in the bureau, while intending to protect them and failing to investigate, are all violations of the criminal law. His crimes are beyond justification. Yesterday, it was reported that the Jiangsu Provincial Government is transferring Yang Heseng to serve as the Chief of the Public Security Bureau in Qidong County. This association believes that Yang Heseng's crimes are unforgivable. If he is allowed to transfer without any punishment, the effectiveness of national laws will be completely lost, which will embolden evildoers and leave future generations with no warning. What is even more concerning is that the hundreds of police officers in Jiading have been heavily influenced by Yang Heseng's negative impact and have come to view wrongdoing as normal. If Yang Heseng is allowed to transfer safely and live freely, the hundreds of police officers, influenced by this perception, will become even more reckless and have no fear of becoming bandits and thieves. The tens of thousands of residents of Jiading will have no peace of mind. Therefore, this association urgently appeals to telegraph the County Magistrate of Jiading County, immediately detaining Yang Heseng, investigating each case of shielding subordinates, privately releasing opium, and allowing police officers to commit theft, and punishing him according to the law. Furthermore, police officers Tao Dexing and others should be executed as a warning to prevent major disasters in the region. We await your orders. Jiading County Chamber of Commerce Chairman Chen Peiqing, Executive Director of the County Education Association Lu Chongbiao, jointly kowtow.</p>
<p>Puan Steamer Continues Service on Shanghai-Qingdao Route</p>
<p>In Response to Qingdao Public Organizations' Request</p>
<p>To Fulfill Responsibility for Competitive Navigation Rights</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's lease of the Navy's Puan steamer has expired and is scheduled to be discontinued. However, various public organizations in Qingdao believe that navigation rights on the Shanghai-Qingdao route have long been controlled by foreign merchants, with Japanese ships having an especially strong presence. The Puan is the only Chinese ship operating regular service on the route. Passengers and businesses have expressed great concern about this situation. Therefore, the Chamber of Commerce and other organizations telegraphed the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, requesting them to continue operating ships for the sake of national sovereignty and to benefit merchants and travelers. Liu Hongsheng specially continued negotiations with the Navy Department to lease the Puan and continue to operate the Shanghai-Qingdao express service. A decision was reached yesterday to extend the contract period under the original terms. It is also planned to resume the Qingdao service on the 15th of this month, with departures every Saturday thereafter. The Company has not stopped the issue of leasing Kean and is still negotiating with the Navy Department.</p>
<p>Sincere Company Donates Disaster Relief Funds</p>
<p>Entire Income of September 28th Star Top Amusement Park</p>
<p>Of 553 Yuan All Used for Disaster Relief Funds</p>
<p>The various charitable organizations in this city are raising funds for the Joint Association for Emergency Relief of the Yellow River Flood Disaster. They previously resolved to send letters to various amusement venues requesting donations for disaster relief. It is now learned that the Sincere Company's Star Top Amusement Park has specially sent 553 yuan, the entire revenue from the September 28th business day, to the Association yesterday. The original letter stated: "To Whom It May Concern: We received your letter the other day regarding the fundraising for emergency relief for the Yellow River disaster. We agreed to allocate all the revenue from our company's Star Top Amusement Park on September 28th to help with disaster relief. We have now checked that the revenue on that day amounted to 553 yuan, 7 jiao and 8 fen, which is enclosed in a check. Please accept it with our best wishes. "</p>

<p>Sudden Attack by Five Thugs with Guns and Axes, Blood Splatters on Bed Curtains</p>
<p>Ji A'gen Shot in the Nose, Bullet Not Exiting</p>
<p>Both Legs Chopped with Four Axe Blows, Left Leg Also Struck Twice</p>
<p>Terrified Wife Escapes into Corner of Bed, Avoiding Harm</p>
<p>—A Feud Over a Gambling Association?—A Dispute Over a Woman?</p>
<p>Ji A'gen, a native of Jiangbei, is 27 years old and works as a coppersmith. He lives with his wife, Mrs. Wang, 25 years old, also from Jiangbei, at No. 57 Yuqing Lane, Gonghe Road, Zhabei. Ji earns a good monthly income, so their life is considered prosperous. However, he is unruly and meddlesome. Yesterday morning around 5:00 AM, just as dawn was breaking, while the Ji couple was still sound asleep, five thugs speaking with a Jiangbei accent suddenly arrived at their home. Armed with handguns and axes, they broke through the back door and went straight to Ji's bedroom. Seeing the Ji couple fast asleep, they pushed them awake. The A'gen couple awoke to find five men standing in front of their bed, each holding a weapon. Sensing something was wrong, they were about to get out of bed and call for help when the five thugs opened fire with guns and axes. Ji sustained serious injuries and fell back into the bed, bleeding profusely. Seeing their goal achieved, the thugs fled out the door. Ji's wife, Mrs. Wang, was fortunate to retreat into the corner of the bed, avoiding harm, but she was terrified and pale. After the thugs left, she ran out of the house, calling for help, awakening the neighbors who came to investigate. They also rushed to report to the Second Precinct of the Fourth District. The precinct chief dispatched a patrol officer with police officers to investigate the scene and immediately sent Ji to the Baolong Hospital in ambulance No. 103 for treatment. It is reported that Ji's legs were struck with four axe blows, his left leg with two axe blows, and a bullet lodged in his nose. Whether his life can be saved remains uncertain. The identities of the thugs and the cause of the feud are unknown. Ji is unable to speak, so there are no leads. However, according to the neighbors, it may be related to a gambling association. This is noted for future observation. The Second Precinct of the Fourth District questioned Ji's wife about the appearance and clothing of the thugs and dispatched police officers to pursue them, notifying other precincts to assist. It has been learned from another source that this incident was caused by Ji's friend surnamed Guo and another person both being in love with the same woman. Although Ji had tried to mediate the situation, giving the woman to the person surnamed Ma, Guo and the woman still maintained a close relationship. When Ji found out, he disapproved of Guo's actions and confronted him, which led to Guo hating Ji and plotting this attack.</p>
<p>The Public Works Department Responds to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Regarding the Consideration of Telephone Rate Hikes</p>
<p>The Chamber of Commerce Again Asks Taxpayers' Association to Fight for Their Rights</p>
<p>Since the Municipal Chamber of Commerce heard news of the telephone company in the concession raising its rates, it sent letters to both Public Works Departments to forward to the company, stating that the rates should not be raised without permission in accordance with the contract, so as not to increase the burden on citizens. The Public Works Department responded to the Chamber of Commerce yesterday, promising to give the matter due consideration. The Chamber of Commerce replied to the Taxpayers' Association, continuing the struggle. Excerpts from the original texts are as follows:</p>
<p>Reply from the Public Works Department</p>
<p>"Dear Sirs, We acknowledge receipt of your letter regarding the telephone rate hike and have noted its contents. The Bureau is currently considering the Shanghai Telephone Company's request regarding this matter and will give due consideration to the points raised in your letter. This is for your information."</p>
<p>Letter from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter yesterday to the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Concession, stating: "Dear Sirs, It has been reported that the Shanghai Telephone Company has again requested the Public Works Department of the Public Concession to approve a rate increase to upgrade its automatic switching equipment. It is said that the proposed increase is one-fifth to one-quarter of the current price. If this is implemented, residential telephone rates, which were 52 taels per year before last year's increase, will be 81.25 taels per year after a quarter increase. Business telephone rates, which were 78 taels per year before last year's increase, will be 131.25 taels per year after a quarter increase. The former will increase by 28.25 taels, and the latter will increase by 53.25 taels. The company is disregarding the difficulties faced by its users and the decline in the market. The telephone fee has already been increased once last year, and now there is another proposal to increase it, which violates the original purpose of public utilities to serve the public. Moreover, in this time of commercial recession, it is already difficult to maintain the current situation. If the telephone costs are further increased, it will be unbearable. Therefore, our colleagues in the industry are shocked and express their opposition. We are reporting this situation in writing and respectfully requesting your Association to forward it to the Chinese Taxpayers' Association to negotiate reasonably and make a strong protest."</p>
<p>According to this, since the news of the telephone company's rate increase spread, the Chamber has sent a letter to the Public Works Department of the Public Concession, conveying reasons why the rate should not be increased. Yesterday, we received a reply stating that the Bureau is considering the telephone company's request and will give due consideration to the points raised in our letter. We are now sending this letter to you and respectfully requesting your Association to take swift action with the strength of all Chinese taxpayers in the city to continue to fight for the cancellation of the rate increase. We deeply hope for your success.</p>

<p>Local Bailiff Dares to Alter Grain Coupons to Defraud</p>
<p>Land Bureau Transfers Case to Court</p>
<p>Ensuring the Local Bailiff is Brought to Justice and Severely Punished</p>
<p>Shen Daosheng, a local bailiff of the Shenjiahang in Songnan, is a man who idles. He likes to gamble and can bet a hundred or even hundreds of gold at a time, without any reluctance. He is also addicted to opium, so his debts are increasing. Unable to make up for it, he had the idea of altering the grain coupons issued by the City Land Bureau to the farmers. For example, he changed one sheng of land to one dou, or three qian of silver to five qian, increasing the original amount several times. He altered all the grain coupons and added the stamp of the local bailiff given by the City Government, deceiving the farmers. However, the changes were not well-made, and villagers such as Zhang discovered the flaws and jointly submitted a request to the City Land Bureau for investigation. The Bureau sent personnel to investigate and found it to be true. They were about to summon the local bailiff when he received the news and fled to another place. He has not been arrested. It is now reported that the Land Bureau has transferred the case to the local court and ordered his arrest, ensuring that the local bailiff is brought to justice and severely punished, so as to stress the importance of grain tax and warn against illegal acts.</p>
<p>Husband and Wife Each Go Their Own Way, Initiating Divorce in Different Locations</p>
<p>Separated by Distances, Neither Party Appears in Court</p>
<p>Courts in Both Locations Handle the Cases Separately</p>
<p>Wei Rucai, a native of Fujian, serves at the Jianghai Customs. In January of the 19th year of the Republic, he married Tian Shuzhen, a woman from his hometown. They lived together at No. 10 Tongyi Lane, Jing'an Temple Road. Tian is now 23 years old, seven years younger than Wei. After their marriage, their relationship was very harmonious. In the early winter of that year, she missed her parents, who lived in Xiamen, and decided to return home, packing all her clothes and belongings. The following spring, Wei fell ill in Shanghai and repeatedly summoned her by letter, but she did not return. When Wei recovered, he heard that Tian had given birth in Xiamen and telegraphed her to return, but she refused and filed for divorce. Wei was surprised by her change in attitude, wondering if she had been influenced by someone. He sent another letter to persuade her, hoping she would realize her mistake and return. However, Tian ignored him and, as a further step, filed a divorce suit in the local court. It is reported that because the defendant did not appear, the court ruled in her absence and mailed the judgment to the First Special District District Court in Shanghai for delivery. When Tian filed suit in Fujian, Wei also filed a divorce suit against Tian in the First Special Court, requesting the return of their child. The case was heard yesterday by Judge Luo Chongtai. The defendant, Tian Shuzhen, of course, did not appear and was only represented by the plaintiff, Wei Rucai, and his attorney, Zhan Yigang, who stated the intention to sue. Judge Luo then took out the judgment from Fujian and ordered Wei to accept it. Wei immediately stated that he did not recognize the judgment, and the court ordered a later hearing.</p>
<p>Residents of Wusong Do Not Forget the Great Deeds of Hu Renji in Building the Seawall</p>
<p>—Special Memorial Meeting Held—</p>
<p>The residents of Wusong, in gratitude for the former Baoshan County Magistrate Hu Gong Renji's sacrifice of his family property to build the seawall, narrowly escaped disaster during the two typhoons last month. In memory of his great deeds, they held a special memorial meeting the other day. The scale of the ceremony was very grand, reflecting the deep respect of the people. The story of Mr. Hu's life is as follows: Hu Renji, also known as Shengqi, was a native of Shanyin, Zhejiang. He first served as magistrate of Dingyuan County. In the tenth year of Yongzheng, he was transferred from Jiangdu to Baoshan. At that time, the county seat was newly built, and everything was in its initial stages. When Renji took office, he repaired the city walls, built the earthen dikes, constructed the granaries and bridges, repaired the Martial Temple and Drum Tower, promoted agriculture and reduced litigation, promoted benefits and eliminated abuses. During his nine years in office, he was honest and loved the people, and the men tilled the fields while the women wove. There was little idleness in the city. In the fifth year of Qianlong, due to the county's proximity to the sea, he built a stone dike and strongly requested the central government to allocate funds for construction. From the Wusong Fort to Chejiayuan, a distance of 1,300 zhang, he managed everything with utmost effort. But higher officials were jealous of his integrity and honesty, and before the project was completed, he was impeached and dismissed. With empty pockets, he resided outside the city, and the elders competed to provide firewood and rice to sustain him. Three years later, after the project was completed, he prepared to leave. The people could not bear to let him go, so they sculpted his statue and erected a shrine to commemorate him.</p>
<p>A Dead Body with Nine Knife Wounds Found in Tanziwan</p>
<p>Ten Yuan in Counterfeit Money Found Near the Body</p>
<p>The Deceased Also Seems to Be No Good</p>
<p>Yesterday morning around 6:00 AM, a male corpse was suddenly discovered in the eastern part of Wangjiajing, Jiaotong Road, Tanziwan, Zhabei. The patrol officer of the Tanziwan police station of the Fourth District, upon hearing the news, rushed to the scene. The corpse was male, about 40 years old, wearing a long black robe and a black cloth cotton jacket. The lower body was naked. There were nine knife wounds on his body. Beside the corpse was a murder weapon, and in the pocket of the cloth jacket was ten yuan of counterfeit banknotes from the Bank of China, two Shandong Public Mint Maojiao coins, eleven copper coins, and a train ticket. Based on the circumstances, this person was definitely not a good person. Since the body could not be identified, the local bailiff was summoned to report to the local court for examination. At the same time, the General Bureau was notified to investigate the truth.</p>
<p>The Abducted Girl Chen Lindi, Unknown to What Family She Belongs</p>
<p>Dimples and Single Eyelid Are Her Distinguishing Features</p>
<p>Xie Zhao Claims Lindi is Her Daughter</p>
<p>But Lindi No Longer Knows Who Her Biological Mother Is</p>
<p>As for Xu Guiying's Family, A Letter Has Been Sent to Jiangdu for Investigation</p>
<p>Jin Yao's fourteen-year-old daughter, Gendi, who resided at No. 12 Tongan Lane, Meiyuan Road, Zhabei, had gone missing on the morning of August 22nd, at about 7:00 AM. After the investigation by the Hongkou Police Station detective Bao Shuji and detective Jin Guanya, the abductor Wang Yufu from Anhui and his Zhenjiang mistress Chen Kong, along with Chen's daughter Chen Lindi, 16 years old, and 14-year-old niece Xu Guiying, were arrested at No. 6 Mahe Road. The girl Jin Gendi was rescued and returned to her mother, Yao. The two women Chen and Xu were sent to the Women and Children's Relief Society for care, and the two defendants were detained pending sentencing.</p>
<p>The other day, Xie Zhao, a woman from Songjiang, and He Wu, a woman from Changzhou, approached the Hongkou Police Station, saying that they had seen in the newspaper that there was a girl named Lindi and a girl named Xu, and asking if they could meet them. These two people had lost their daughters in March of the 13th and 18th years of the Republic, one named Lindi, 7 years old, and one named Yinfeng, 15 years old. The police dispatched detectives to accompany the two women to the Women and Children's Relief Society to investigate. Xie Zhao identified Chen Lindi as her daughter, but Xu was not Yinfeng. Yesterday morning, the police took the two defendants and the two girls Chen and Xu to the Third Criminal Court. The police lawyer Zhang Tian stated that the two defendants were scheduled to be sentenced today, but requested a postponement for detailed investigation. According to Xie Zhao, 54 years old, her daughter, named Lindi, had gone missing at the age of seven in March in Mali Shi Ma Anli. She had reported it to the Xinzha Police Station and offered a reward for her search. For over ten years, there had been no news. Her daughter had two dimples on her face and a single eyelid, and she identified Chen Lindi as her daughter. When questioned, Chen spoke the Zhenjiang dialect and said that she had been abducted at the age of seven by another woman and had stayed in places such as Liu Ma Road and inside the West Gate. At the age of ten, she went to the defendant Chen Kong's house and called her "mother." When she was abducted, she was always locked upstairs and not allowed to go downstairs. She was young and did not know who her birth mother was. However, she could not fully remember Xie Xu as her birth mother. Her husband, Rong Sheng, 57 years old, from Wuxi, who lives in Mali Shi, said that they had lived there for 25 years. His daughter Lindi was only seven years old when she went missing. Now that she is grown, her appearance is different from before, but her eyes are the same as his. He brought his daughter to have a look, and she said she did not recognize him. He Wu said that she used to live at No. 1000 Ximadeli, Mali Shi, which has now been rebuilt. On March 14th of the 18th year of the Republic, her 15-year-old daughter Yinfeng had been abducted and reported to the Xinzha Police Station. She recognized the defendant Chen Kong, because she often went to her place to get her hair done. She saw Chen Lindi and thought she was her daughter, because the girl often came to her house and played with Yinfeng. She asked Lindi, who said that she had been abducted. Lindi said that Yinfeng had been brought by Kong and a man surnamed Zhao, and they stayed together for one night before leaving for the inn the next day and never returning. When questioned, Chen Kong confessed that Lindi had been brought by a man surnamed Yang and her mother when she was nine years old. They agreed on a price of 140 yuan and signed a contract, which is now with a relative in Suzhou City. She did not know she was from Songjiang. She had no children and bought her to be an adopted daughter. This matter was handled by her late husband, Chen Guanquan. As for He Wu's daughter Yinfeng, she denied it, saying she did not abduct her. The police lawyer Zhang stated that Chen Kong had an accomplice named Zhao Yuchun who specialized in selling people. As for the girl Xu Guiying, the police planned to send detectives to Jiangbei to investigate. Xu said that she lived in Huangjiacun, Jiangbei, and her parents and uncles were all dead. She lived with her grandmother. This spring, she was abducted by a beggar woman to the Xiannv Temple in Yangzhou and sold to a woman surnamed Xu as her daughter. This summer, her mother came to Shanghai with her, and they called Chen Kong "auntie," and so on. Judge Liu Yugui ruled that the girl Chen Lindi could not confirm Xie Zhao and her father, and should remain temporarily at the Women and Children's Relief Society for further investigation. He dispatched detectives with official documents to Jiangdu County to investigate Xu Guiying's family. The two defendants were returned to custody, and the hearing was postponed.</p>
<p>Wang Jinbao Commits Suicide Due to Unemployment</p>
<p>—An Event That Society Should Pay Attention To—</p>
<p>Wang Jinbao, 20 years old from Zhenjiang, used to work for a tobacco company. He lost his job and has been unemployed for a month. He had been staying with his brother, Lin Bao, at No. 499 Huacheng Road, Hongkou, and had asked people to help him find work, but there were no opportunities. After thinking about it, he was increasingly uneasy about being a guest at his brother's house. Yesterday morning around 8:00 AM, he went out and bought eight jiao of raw opium and returned home. He then had the idea of taking his own life, secretly consuming all of it. Before long, the poison took effect, and he vomited uncontrollably. His brother discovered it and took him to Tongren Hospital by car, but he had consumed too much poison and died at 11:00 AM.</p>

<p>Jiangjing Strike Resolved</p>
<p>All Middle-Class Workers Dismissed</p>
<p>The Bureau Distributes Severance Pay</p>
<p>Arrangements for Living Six Months Later</p>
<p>The Jiangjing, a ship of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, was leased to Datta Navigation. Replacing workers in the middle class caused a strike, making the ship unable to navigate. The business loss was huge. Yesterday, the maritime union and Liu Hongsheng of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company resolved to issue dismissal payments for five months. Further details are listed below.</p>
<p>Leasing the Boat</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company ship Jiangjing is 1,151 tons and is not suitable for the Jiangsu route. Yang Ying, the chairman of Datta Navigation, discussed this with Liu Hongsheng. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company kept the employees operating the ship and paid for the coal, driving, and engine. The rent was rumored to be 7,500 yuan each month. The contract stated that the company needed the boat would notify the leaseholder two months in advance. The lease was granted to Datta earlier this month.</p>
<p>Dismissing the Workers</p>
<p>The Jiangjing had over 70 workers in the middle class and over 40 staff in the business and cargo departments. Datta Navigation did not need the many workers because the ship was sailing down the small Yangtze River. Datta Navigation discussed and agreed with the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to dismiss over 120 workers from both departments. Datta Navigation would then hire staff and workers. This caused an altercation and strike.</p>
<p>Negotiating the Strike</p>
<p>The Jiangjing workers in the middle class believed the dismissal to be improper. They refused to accept the order and remain on the ship. The workers did not allow the new workers from Datta Navigation to take over. At the same time, the workers reported the issue to the maritime union. The maritime union sent representatives to Liu Hongsheng and requested that the current workers remain on the ship. Liu Hongsheng said that Datta Navigation did not need that many workers and had to replace them. Negotiations failed after many days.</p>
<p>Dismissal Terms</p>
<p>The issue between both sides led to the ship delaying sailing. Yesterday, representatives from the preparation committee of the maritime union made a final negotiation with the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. The middle-class workers requested five months of salary if they were to be dismissed. Liu Hongsheng conceded. It was decided that each of the 70 middle-class workers on the Jiangjing would receive dismissal payments. Each person would receive 15 yuan for the first two months with payment made today. Each person would receive 12 yuan each month for the next five months, totaling 66 yuan. Six months later, the bureau would arrange their living.</p>
<p>Sailing Today</p>
<p>All the middle-class workers signed the agreement yesterday. The bureau then paid each person 30 yuan. The workers left the boat at the order of the union. Datta Navigation then sent their new workers on board yesterday afternoon. The ship is to sail to Tongzhou tonight. The ship will specialize in sailing the Shanghai-Yangzhou line from the next shift.</p>
<p>Tap Water in Pudong Provided by Local Water Company</p>
<p>Effective October 1st</p>
<p>Residents living near Xujiahui and the banks of the Puhuitang River used to drink tap water provided by a French water company because the local water company did not have water pipes installed. However, it was agreed that the water would be switched once water pipes from the local company had arrived. The Municipal Bureau said that tap water from the local water company has been sufficient since being reorganized. The main pipe had reached Tianlin Bridge and was not far from the water supply area. Therefore, the French company should stop its water supply. In addition, the local company, Pudong, installed a 15.0 millimeter pipe along the road from the west bank of the Puhuitang River and the Xujiahui area. The pipe reached the triangle area on the east bank, which is in the water supply area of southern Shanghai. The process cost over 20,000 yuan. Effective the 1st of this month, water is provided by the local company. The water is reportedly more sufficient than before. From now on, water rights in the area belong to the local company. Residents can request connection.</p>
<p>Support Association Discovers Embezzlement</p>
<p>Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association recently received reports from the directors. Liu Shande and Zeng Zhiping claimed to be from Guangdong, Anhui, and Zhejiang provinces. They also used the Support Association's letterhead to fabricate resumes saying they used to work for the Patriotic and Support Association, but are currently unemployed and request economic assistance. This is a fraud. The person in charge of the Support Association said that Liu Shande was hired as an assistant accountant last winter, but was fired in February of this year. He had no affiliation with the Association. Zeng Zhiping was a temporary worker and was recently let go due to downsizing. Liu and Zeng are young and may be mingling with the wrong crowd. The Support Association sent replies to each director rejecting the requests. The Support Association is asking other organizations to be aware of Liu and Zeng's actions.</p>
<p>International Bicycle Race Tomorrow</p>
<p>The Shanghai Bike Association will host the first 25-mile open bicycle race tomorrow. President Tang Guanyan said that the race had been announced in the newspapers and people from all sectors have applied. The race will take place tomorrow starting at 8:00 AM. The starting and ending point will be at the corner of Hongqiao Road and Macleod Road. The race should be complete in an hour. If it rains, the race will be delayed to the 22nd. Mrs. Lei Nan will be presenting the awards at the Huierkang Restaurant across from Zhaofeng Park at 10:00 AM. Prizes include a local race car, a Dunlop tire cup, a German [Tabitu] and [Jile deshi] newly styled free break, a leather jacket, a leather cigarette case, and a diary. After the awards, there will be a photo session. Biking is a sport that benefits the mind and body. Western countries highly value the sport and western schools will have teams coming to cheer. It is hoped that organizations in China will also promote the sport, encourage the people, and bring glory to the country.</p>

<p>Won three to two, but it was very difficult. If Henan has more opportunities to watch, there will be unlimited hope for the future. At nine o'clock, the Hong Kong team, dressed in short velvet pants with white shirts with red characters, was full of energy and did not resemble a newly formed army. The referee Tao Shaoyu gave the order in a stormy manner. Henan's Zheng Liuwen kicked off. The Hong Kong team underestimated the enemy and missed two points. The third ball was served. The Hong Kong back row passed the ball to the front line. Wu Enyao blocked the ball and killed it with force, winning the serve. Zhu Jiaoxin worked hard to catch up, creating a tie. High balls went back and forth, with each side gaining and losing. At that time, Henan's balls came like a storm. Hong Kong's Zhu Jiaoxin panicked when facing the ball, twisted his foot and fell to the ground, crying in pain. He was replaced. In the first half, Hong Kong led 11 to 10. In the second half, Hong Kong broke through the defenses again. Henan's Zheng Liuwen rose up in anger and, in the last three minutes, chased from a tie to 21 to 19. Henan won, boosting each other's morale. At the beginning of the second game, Hong Kong spectators shouted to cheer. At that time, Henan's cheerleaders arrived and supported each other, creating a strong momentum. The Hong Kong team then recovered its lost ground with a score of 21 to 19, suffering a terrible encirclement. In the third game, Hong Kong's chubby Ye Huiwen scored four points alone. Henan's front row was careless in closing the door, the midfield coordination was not good, and there were too many serving errors. In the first half, they suffered a terrible encirclement with a score of 11 to 4. Although they struggled in the second half, they made too many mistakes and could not catch up, losing with a score of 21 to 14. It was extremely exciting. In the fourth game, Hong Kong's Luo Yuehao served. The ball landed very close to the opponent's zone. The referee thought it was out of bounds and watched it being re-served. Unexpectedly, the landing point was exactly inside the opponent's zone. The second ball was killed by Henan's Cui Ming. Henan's Wang Xiuzhen served, all the way smoothly. The Hong Kong team was also evenly matched, with the scores close and no major difference. In the first half, Hong Kong led 11 to 9. If Henan won this game, they could play another game, so they desperately smashed and killed, making the game even more exciting when both sides reached 20 points each. Until they reached 23 points each, Henan won with a one or two-point difference after a bitter battle. It was a matter of life and death. The fifth game was the key to life and death. The coaches of both sides gathered their players, gave them instructions face to face, and encouraged them to fight again. Hong Kong's Huiwen's serve failed. At that time, Henan's Shi Songhe danced with the sword, and the entire court was filled with excitement. The score was tied at 9-9. Hong Kong, with the reputation of its great players, could not easily fall into the hands of its opponents and also chased urgently. However, in the first half, they lost to Henan with a score of 9 to 11. After changing positions, it was very difficult to coordinate the front and back rows. The scores reached 13 each. Finally, in the midst of repeated advances and retreats, Hong Kong's Wu Daizhao served. Henan panicked and did not respond, making consecutive errors. Hong Kong then ended the game with a score of 21 to 17, winning the overall match with a score of 3 to 2. Overview of ball skills: Looking at the overall situation, Hong Kong is indeed an extraordinary team of famous players, and Henan's smashes, kills, and serves are all commendable. However, their ball-handling is not stable, and they often panic when the ball comes, which is the main reason for their failure. Hong Kong Team: First Row, Second Row, Third Row: Wu Enyao, Luo Yuehao, Zhu Jiaoxin; Wu Enzhao, Zhu Yunqin, Chen Fang; Zhu Yanwen, Mai Yueceng, Ye Huiwen. Henan Team: First Row, Second Row, Third Row: Cui Ming, Du Rongyuan, Wang Xiuzhen; Sun Buxin, Du Fang, Zhou Houde; Shi Songhe, Yu Aiqin, Zheng Liuwen.</p>

<p>(Nanjing, 13th Dispatch) The match between Ping Huang Shuyi and Xiang Xiao Jingying also started at the same time. Ping Huang Shuyi's serves were accurate and fast, and her posture was excellent, which is rare among women. Her forehand and backhand strokes were also very good. Xiang Xiao Jingying's strokes were also decent, but her serves were slightly weaker, with frequent errors. The first set was tense. She took the lead with a score of 4-1 with a burst of courage. Seeing the situation was not good, Huang Shuyi quickly caught up, saving two games and losing the first set with a score of 4-6. In the second set, Huang slightly took the lead, with Xiao only winning the second and sixth games. Huang won with a score of 6-2. Therefore, Xiao and Huang each won a set, and the outcome was entirely determined in the third set. It is expected that the competition will be even more fierce. However, at the beginning of the game, Xiao slumped and lost three consecutive games. Huang took a commanding lead with a score of 3-0. At this time, although Xiao struggled to gain a service game, the overall situation was gone. Although she wanted to turn the tide, she was unable to do so. In the last game, Huang resolved the game with four serves. As a result, Ping Huang won Xiang Xiao with a score of 4-6, 6-2, 6-1.</p>

The Ping team's morale was high. Game after game, they took the lead with a score of 5-0. The Xiang team tried to counterattack, showing some color, chasing four consecutive games to make the score 5-4. Then Ping took the service game, ending the two sets with a score of 6-4. The score was 6-2, 6-4, and Ping won.</p>
<p>Nanjing Eliminates Suiyuan and Advances to the Second Week; A World of Difference. (Nanjing, 13th Dispatch) Jing's first singles player, Liu Yuelan, defeated Sui Li Xingyuan. The strength of the two sides was very different, forming a one-sided situation. As a result, Liu won two consecutive sets with a score of 6-1, 6-0, being不堪一击. The doubles match between Jing Chen Qing Chen Xi Bao and Sui Li Tingfang Li Zuoxu was also held at 2 PM. The cooperation between the two Chens was still good, but their ball skills were average. As a result of the two sets, Jing won with two scores of 6-0. The doubles match was over. The first singles match between Jing Huang Shan and Sui Song Shoumei followed. The strength of the two sides was worlds apart, so the situation was lackluster and there were no exciting moments. As a result, Jing won again with two scores of 6-0. In total, Sui only won one game in the first set of the first singles match in the six sets of singles and doubles matches between Jing and Sui on the 13th. It can be seen how poor their skills were. It is understandable that they are located in a remote border area and have not yet developed.</p>

<p>(Nanjing, 13th Dispatch) Jin Wang Chunqing looked like four people. Her strokes were fast and sharp, hitting deep into both corners. However, her backhand was still lacking. Yue Huang Ruoqiu was not weak either. The competition in the first set was very fierce. Huang finally failed with a slightly weaker strength, losing with a score of 2-6. At the beginning of the second set, Wang Chunqing showed great promise, hitting wherever she wanted, making it difficult for the opponent to parry, winning six consecutive games.

<p>The Yue team's skills were proficient and seamless, while the Jin team was far from their opponent. Yue won two consecutive sets with a score of 6-0, 6-2. Jin had already won a singles match in the morning, so the second singles match, which started at 3 PM in the afternoon, was related to the outcome. Therefore, each side tried their best to compete, repelling strong enemies with great effort. For this women's tennis championship, Jin and Jing were eager to win. They have the Wang sisters, who are of Western descent and have pure and proficient ball skills. The championship is indeed promising. In the first singles match, Jin sent Wang Chunwei to play, while Yue sent Lin Meihua to face her. Lin was petite and exquisite, and her skills were not weak either. At the beginning of the first set, Wang scored two games first. Lin quickly caught up, taking the lead with a score of 3-2. Then Wang pulled back a game, making the score 3-3. Later, Lin worked hard to cope and also won three games, winning the first set with a score of 6-3. In the second set, Wang showed her skills, winning three consecutive games.

<h3>Preliminary Round for Men's National Martial Arts Equipment and Spear Skills Competition.</h3>
<p>The preliminary round for the men's equipment and spear skills competition on the morning of the 12th was quite interesting. Among the participants, Suiyuan had the most. The Suiyuan athletes' spear skills mostly involved wielding bright spears (also known as flower spears), which were extremely agile and nimble. According to this skill, it has been taught by ancient people for more than 300 years and occupies a very important position in national martial arts. On the 12th, in the lightweight division, Liu Sishou (Suiyuan) fought Zhu Zhengsen (Qingdao). Although Zhu was agile, he was no match for Liu's sinister spear skills.

<h3>Before the 100-Meter Start: Artillery Students Shouted and Scolded Each Other with a Person Wearing the Central University Badge—Delaying the Event by Five Minutes.</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 13th Dispatch) Before the third preparation for the 200-meter final on the 13th, just as the athletes were about to take their positions, a major conflict occurred in the guest area above the starting point of the East Stadium. A group of artillery school students shouted, and the Boy Scouts were almost unable to maintain order. It was found that a guest wearing a badge of Central University 173, accompanied by a spouse, sat down first. Then, more than 30 artillery students sat next to him. Because they were talking loudly, the guest stopped them, saying that soldiers should maintain order. The team leader of the school said that he was maintaining order and that no one dared to say anything with him around. He asked the guest to leave. The guest also refused to back down and started a verbal battle with the team leader, even scolding each other. The artillery team members joined in the scolding, and the shouts shook half the field, causing the athletes and starters to have to temporarily suspend preparations. Then, the Boy Scouts came out, blocking the soldiers on one side, while the female companion also came out to state the reasons tactfully. The team leader then ordered his subordinates to stop and leave their positions, and personally confronted the guest, asking why he was insulting the soldiers. The Boy Scouts stopped him to prevent him from getting close. The team leader asked the Boy Scouts to order the guest to leave. The Boy Scouts replied that everyone was a guest and it was not good to be biased, and asked for forgiveness. At this time, the starter below shouted to maintain order, and the stage was quiet. Then, the starter re-issued the preparation order and started the race. In total, this small disturbance delayed the event by five minutes. Fighting in the public area was wrong on both sides.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Decision Before the Final Changed the Starting and Ending Points; The Competition Group and the Venue Group Had Different Opinions—Delaying the Competition by One Hour.</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 13th Dispatch) Before the 200-meter final, the end point of the race, according to the regulations of the venue group, was at the southern end of the west track. The starting and ending points should have equipment, that is, arrangements were already in place. However, at 12:30, the competition group accepted Guan Songsheng's opinion that the track had been used for three consecutive days and was no longer usable. It should be changed to the east track, running from north to south. The venue group did not prepare until before 2:00. However, running from north to south was directly facing the sunlight, which was unreasonable, and there was no space at the end point for sprinting. The starting point had to be at the southern end, and the wind was from the south. Changing to the north would avoid the headwind, which would greatly affect the results. Both sides insisted on their own opinions. After many explanations, all the referees agreed with the venue group's opinion and moved the starting point to the southern end, delaying a lot of time. Overtime, most of the athletes and spectators in the field surged like a tide, rushing to the end point of the 200 meters and standing still, causing the entire field to focus on one of the most exciting scenes, which could not be held. The Boy Scouts could not maintain order either. Yuan Dunli rushed to report to Ma Xiang, who sent 30 armed guards to deceive all the spectators out of the track before firing a gun to start the race. However, it had already been delayed by an hour.</p>
<h3>Assisting Liu Changchun's Life; Liu's Practice in the South Still Needs to Be Considered.</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 13th Dispatch) After the 200-meter final, Duanmu Ji, Director of the Construction Department of the Ministry of Military Affairs, approached Liu Changchun to talk to him, asking about his future aspirations and life in Beijing. He would do his best to provide full assistance. While stabilizing his life, he would also give Liu the opportunity to continue practicing so that he could become an outstanding talent in Chinese sports. Liu said that his current monthly salary in Beijing was only 80 or 90 yuan, relying on the assistance of Ming Chang. His current life could be barely maintained. A few months ago, he received a letter from Shi Xinglong, saying that Minister Zhu Jiahua invited him to come to the South to serve. However, he was still considering whether the life and environment in the South were suitable for his personality. He hoped that Liu could have the opportunity to come to Beijing to further his studies.</p>
<h3>Breaking the National Pole Vault Record; Fu Baolu's Experience; Arriving in Shanghai from Harbin at the End of August to Serve; Preparing to Attend the Far East Games Next Year.</h3>
<p>I remember that in the National Games ten years ago, Mr. Fu Baolu first met the Chinese people. At that time, he only won the national pole vault championship with a childish score of 3.28 meters. He was able to overwhelm the crowd and win the national championship with such a young age and childish record. Therefore, since then, everyone in the national sports world has known this young and handsome Mr. Fu Baolu. Unfortunately, the Japanese occupied the three northeastern provinces two years ago, and Mr. Fu was isolated in his second hometown of Harbin. Compatriots in the country have not heard of Mr. Fu's whereabouts for a long time. After the Japanese occupied the three northeastern provinces, they advanced to the Great Wall, and then forced Peiping and Tianjin, and finally stopped the war with the enemy under coercion. However, the entire Northeast has been handed over to the enemy, and 20 million compatriots in the Northeast have also fallen under the enemy's trampling. Mr. Fu Baolu, who lived in Harbin, tasted endless pain. Therefore, his motive for coming south has long been hidden in his heart. Over the years, not only has Chinese diplomacy failed, and foreign military affairs have failed, but also in the international sports arena, how can we not fail? The tenth Far East Games will open in a blink of an eye, and China's complete defeat has long been expected. Unexpectedly, Mr. Fu, who has been separated from the Chinese people for a long time, brought the record of 3.80 meters back to Guannei, preparing to win a breath for China in the Far East Games next year. Since Mr. Fu attended the 14th North China Games, which opened in Pan Yang in the 18th year of the Republic of China, until this year's National Games, his pole vaulting record has risen from 3 meters to 3.80 meters. In the past five years, his achievements have been leaping forward day by day. With his hard training, his talent, and his age, in the shortest period of time, it is not difficult to drive side by side with Nishi Tian of Dongying and Ning Le of the New World, and to be as good as them. I first met Mr. Fu at the last Far East Games, but I never thought that we would be gathering together day and night now. Colleagues who are interested in the life and history of Mr. Fu are happy to know. Mr. Fu is not from Harbin. He grew up in the provincial capital of Jilin, and later moved to Harbin. His father likes sports very much, so there are many sports equipment in his garden. In the 13th year of the Republic of China, when Mr. Fu was ten years old, he studied at Dongte No. 1 Primary School and served as the school team of basketball and netball. In the 16th year of the Republic of China, Harbin held the first joint sports meeting. At the age of 14, Fu represented his alma mater to participate, and won the third runner-up in the children's group 50 meters, 100 meters, and 200 meters, the second place in the personal total score, and the championship in the children's group of Lianhuan Pingpang. Mr. Fu's sports life started from this time. At that time, the public sports field in Harbin had an athletics team organized by Russians, and a public sports meeting was held every Saturday afternoon. No Chinese athletes joined this transfer body. The public sports field was run by Russians and the facilities were very comprehensive and complete. The membership fee was only one yuan per person per year. Fu joined resolutely and practiced with the Russians every morning. After graduating from Dongte No. 1 Primary School, he entered Dongte No. 3 Middle School. In June of the 18th year of the Republic of China, Mr. Fu participated in the 14th North China Games for the first time. Unexpectedly, he won the championship of the North China Intermediate Group pole vault with a score of 3 meters. At this time, Mr. Fu was only sixteen years old. The following year, the National Games were held in Hangzhou. Mr. Fu came to the South for the first time and became famous throughout the country with a score of 3.28 meters. In the same year, he attended the 9th Far East Games held in Japan. Unfortunately, he was defeated with a score of 3.40 meters. However, according to his personal score, he has made much more progress. After the failure of the Far East, Mr. Fu returned to Harbin and continued to practice hard in his spare time. Soon, he achieved a score of 3.42 meters in the Harbin Open Sports Meeting. The following year, he attended the 15th North China Games held in Jinan, and then broke the national record of 3.495 meters maintained by Xia Xiang of Central University in the Far East Company Sports Meeting in the 14th year of the Republic of China with a score of 3.54 meters. Mr. Fu's pole vaulting has to be attributed to his mentor, Mr. Ge Fudeng. Mr. Ge is a Russian who has maintained the Northeast foreign pole vaulting record for many years, with a score of 3.56 meters. After Mr. Fu returned from the 15th North China Games, he broke Mr. Ge's record and surpassed it. On August 23rd of the 20th year, Mr. Fu created an excellent score of 3.70 meters in the Harbin Open Sports Meeting. After the Northeast was occupied, Mr. Fu repeatedly thought of coming to the mainland. Due to family resistance and Japanese surveillance, it was difficult to get out. He expected to graduate from Dongte in three years, and then entered a Russian overseas Chinese school to study. The indoor sports equipment of the Russian school is very complete. At this time, Fu worked hard to train on parallel bars, horizontal bars, rings, etc., which helped a lot in pole vaulting. Mr. Fu's recent rapid progress has been aided by his equipment exercises. At the end of August this year, Mr. Fu resolutely packed his bags and went south. As the saying goes, where there is a will, there is a way. As a result, he was able to escape to Shanghai. The Shanghai Lefen Bookstore admired his talent and hired him as a document writer in the sports editorial department. Fu is very busy with the publication of sports series and the Diligence Sports Monthly by the bookstore, and the bureau is located opposite the athletics field of the China National Sports Association, so it is very convenient to practice after work. Since Mr. Fu arrived in Shanghai, he has repeatedly shown his skills, reaching the highest peak of 3.84 meters, and broke the national record with 3.785 meters in the ten events of the Shanghai Municipal Games. Yesterday afternoon, he won the first place in the National Games with a score of 3.75 meters, breaking the national record. In the future Far East Games, Mr. Fu may be able to add glory to the country. I hope Mr. Fu will work harder. Finally, Mr. Fu is very friendly and amiable, and everyone is happy to associate with him, and he has no bad habits of athletes. This is Mr. Fu's specialty.</p>

<h3>The Weather in Beijing Was Sunny Yesterday; Central Authorities Visited.</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 13th Dispatch) The fourth day of the National Games on the 13th was sunny. The ball games in the morning all entered the next round, and the men's and women's track and field finals were in the afternoon. The program was becoming more and more exciting. There were about 100,000 spectators. Chairman Lin arrived at the venue at 10:00 AM to watch soccer and martial arts competitions. Wang Shijie, Wang Zhengting, Zhang Boling, and other people came in person to preside over the afternoon. Sun Ke, Zhu Jiaxun, Zeng Zhongming, Zhao Pilian, Jiao Yitang, and other central committee members and ministers of various ministries attended. All the finals broke records, which was the biggest gain of this National Games.</p>
<h3>The Athletes Will Pay Respects to the Mausoleum Tomorrow Morning.</h3>
<p>The Secretariat of the National Games issued a notice yesterday, saying that it is scheduled to be held at 6:00 AM on the 15th (Sunday).

<h3>Race Walking Performance Today; At the Athletics Field at 5:00 PM.</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 13th Dispatch) The Shanghai Race Walking Association has agreed with the National Games Competition Committee that a race walking performance will be held at the athletics field at 5:00 PM on the 14th.</p>
<h3>The National Sports Association Will Hold a Meeting at the Lizhi Society Tonight.</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 13th Dispatch) The National Sports Association will hold a meeting at the Lizhi Society at 7:00 PM on the 14th. Representatives of all units have been notified to attend on time.</p>
<h3>Fu Baolu of Diligence Bookstore Wins the Pole Vault Championship; Also Breaks the National Record.</h3>
<p>Mr. Fu Baolu, an employee of the sports editorial department of Shanghai Diligence Bookstore, won the pole vault championship in the National Games yesterday and broke the national record. Last night, after the bureau received the news, all the staff sent a telegram to congratulate him.</p>
<h3>Interview with Veteran Athlete Ji (Nanjing, 13th Dispatch).</h3>
<p>Several veteran athletes were interviewed at the National Games. Zhu Ende also came to visit. Mr. Zhu Ende is a pioneer in China's sports world. He has added glory to the country in the 3rd, 4th, and 5th Far East Games. Mr. Shi was stimulated by today's country and society, resulting in mental disorder. He has been deeply imprisoned in his home for seven years. This spring, he followed the Beijing athletes to Qingdao to visit the North China Games. At that time, his illness had not yet healed, so the general newspapers did not know Zhu Jun's previous achievements and mostly criticized him. This time, Mr. Zhu came to the South again to visit the National Games. He arrived in Beijing by car from Beijing with Mr. She Rongtang a few days ago and stayed at the Central Hotel. When the reporter heard the news, he went to record it. Mr. Zhu was tall and strong, especially strong. His internal development was more than Chen Baoqiu in Shanghai. Mr. Zhu's health has fully recovered, but his mental state still feels unclear, probably because Mr. Zhu was originally a good talent in China's sports world, and the social people cannot sympathize with him, so Zhu's attitude is mostly negative. Also, because he has been in Xiang for himself, he has invisibly become an unemployed person, and Zhu's colleagues, such as Zhang Xinfu and Ma Yuelun, have now become a number of sports leaders in the country. If not, as in the past, it is heard that Du Rongtang is now introducing Mr. Zhu to Shanghai Jiaotong University to serve as a sports instructor. I wonder if it can be successful. I hope that the national sports community will give strong support.</p>
<h3>Du Rongtang Cries About the Past and Present.</h3>
<p>Mr. Du Rongtang, a native of Luanzhou, Hebei, is currently employed at the Beijing General Bureau of the Beijing-Ning Railway. He was hired to come to Beijing this time to serve as an athletics referee. Mr. Du is a meritorious official in China's sports world. He has won the championship in five decathlons in the past Far East Games. Du has given up sports for a long time. This time, when the reporter asked him about his feelings about China's sports world, Mr. Du couldn't help but sigh and said that the athletes in China now mostly use sports as an opportunity to show off, and also talk about 변애.

<p>Fashion Supplement, Issue 6</p>
<p>Fashion Consultant: Early Autumn Fashion for Young Women</p>
<p>Slightly Overweight, Average Height, in an Environment Close to Education</p>
<p>Qiu Hua</p>
<p>Esteemed Sir:</p>
<p>Having read your advertisement in the newspaper, I deeply admire your dedication. I am writing to outline my requirements and would be most grateful if you could trouble yourself to reply. I earnestly wish you good health.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>Li Xin'en</p>
<p>Age: Twenty-five or twenty-six</p>
<p>Build: Height 5 feet 3 and a half inches (measured wearing flat shoes)</p>
<p>Weight: 120 pounds, slightly overweight compared to the average person</p>
<p>Complexion: Medium</p>
<p>Hair: Black, permed</p>
<p>Climate: Spring, autumn, summer, winter</p>
<p>Occasions for Wear: Casual wear, evening wear, semi-formal dress, sightseeing attire</p>
<p>Mailing Address: Yenching University, Peiping</p>
<p>Now that early autumn has arrived, and new clothes are about to be prepared, naturally the most important thing is to plan for early autumn attire. So, let's start by discussing early autumn clothing.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "One can only assess the design of clothing by looking at the wearer." The first thing to understand is the wearer's economic circumstances. Miss Li Xin'en has not specified her economic situation, nor has she stated her gender or profession, making it difficult to design for her (or him). Based on her letter stating that her "hair is permed" and her height, I will assume it is women's clothing and suppose that she is a young woman or unmarried woman from an educated family, and design accordingly.</p>
<p>Casual Wear: "Casual wear" does not necessarily refer to clothing worn for housework. However, I assume this lady is not a completely idle young mistress or modern Miss, so her casual wear should ideally not be made of overly elaborate fabrics. This is because she may be managing the household, running errands, or even still studying or teaching. This outfit can be worn at any time without needing frequent changes. The style of the clothing should simply be an ordinary lined cheongsam. The cheongsam fabric can be a light gray pure silk crepe, and the lining can be plain silk. The collar, front, and slits of the cheongsam should all be trimmed with a three-fen wide black plain satin. If she likes, she can add a two-fen wide black ribbon. This not only complements her complexion but also, with the black trim, can make her slightly overweight and not very tall figure appear slimmer, and is very elegant and quiet.</p>
<p>Evening Wear: On early autumn evenings, the jade dew is heavy, and supplementing with warmth is important. Therefore, the fabric should be chosen to be thicker. Currently, a type of fabric called "Ermei crepe" is popular in Shanghai. Its body is roughly thicker than pure silk crepe, and a single layer can be as warm as a lined garment. The style is as shown in the picture. The upper body is made of printed Ermei crepe, the lower body is made of plain black Ermei crepe, and the sleeves are made of plain white Ermei crepe. The cuffs are made with a lotus leaf edge with a wide black border. If going out, add a half-leather short jacket (as shown in the picture). The short jacket is made of lake-colored beauty satin (as thick as gabardine, pure silk woven, one side is satin, the other side is like grape crepe. It has become popular in Shanghai for coats, mostly using the crepe side as the front). Attach a five-inch wide black Persian lamb collar four inches above the bottom hem, going straight to the two lapels of the jacket. It is both elegant and dignified, and wearing it in the evening adds a lot of color.</p>
<p>Semi-formal Dress: Can be made of light gray soft satin, style as on the left.</p>
<p>Travel Attire: When traveling in the mountains and waters in early autumn, wearing an overcoat feels inconvenient for walking. Not wearing an overcoat is also worrying in case of wind. Short jackets are merely attractive and even less practical. Therefore, it must be something that does not hinder walking and is sufficient to keep warm, yet not too hot when walking, which is very troublesome. Therefore, it is best to wear a lined silk shirt made of a silk material similar to the casual wear mentioned above, and add a snug short jacket. The material can be made of double-layer satin, fastened with flat, wide, light-colored buttons (as shown in the picture). Double satin is also popular in Shanghai, with both sides being satin and in two different colors (red and black, or red and yellow, or red and lake blue). If it rains lightly, the black side can be worn on the outside; if there is wind and sand, the yellow side can be worn on the outside. Isn't that very appropriate?</p>
<p>The above are just designs based on speculations about the northern environment, and are only a general indication. How to change it is up to each individual's preference, and everyone should come up with their own ideas.</p>
<p>Fashion and Its Economic Impact (Continued)</p>
<h3>Peculiar Tastes, Extravagant Decorations, Will Become the Subjugation of Men.</h3>
<p>Xu Tao</p>
<p>At this point, we might ask ourselves: If a fashion is already popular in society, inherently elegant and beautiful, and caters to the psychology of society, why are other fashions hastily designed to replace it? This question did not begin today. The great French writer La Bruyere of the 16th century already noted this in his work "Calactere".</p>
<p>"One fashion has scarcely disappeared when another, newer one, has destroyed it; but it still yields to another that follows; yet this is not the last."</p>
<p>Therefore, answering this question is indeed very difficult, because the reasons for fashion changes are mostly related to economics and subtle psychology.</p>
<p>In my personal opinion, vanity has a considerable relationship with women's fashion. If we observe the facts, if a stylish and wealthy woman sees that the clothes she is wearing are already popular in society, let alone widespread, she will definitely not want to wear the same clothes as her peers, so-called aversion arising from uniformity. Therefore, the only method is to rush to several large tailoring shops to buy newer fashions. Consequently, these stores control everything, and it can be said that they are the masters of modern women.</p>
<p>However, we must also note that these fashionable women should imagine and create their own fashion designs. Otherwise, for the sake of the very ordinary and basic need for clothing, they will become the subjugation of men, paying a poor industrial tax.</p>
<p>From an economic standpoint, for the purpose of production and profit, fashions are deliberately made to change frequently, even excessively and randomly. Chamford once said:</p>
<p>"Fashion changes are the tax that vanity and wealth pay to the poor industry."</p>
<p>The sudden return of fashion defeats these loyal followers of fashion, forcing them to continue buying new things, and even more severely, preventing them from using clothing and accessories from one season to the next. Therefore, in Western clothing, narrow short skirts were previously worn, suddenly replaced by wide long skirts; in Chinese clothing, skirts were abolished and replaced by cheongsams. Also, in terms of color, a certain color that was originally loved suddenly becomes another, unattractive and eye-stinging color.</p>
<p>The constant changes in fashion force us to think about the issue of these outdated items. What is their use, what do they become? I dare not answer this question rashly. Wealthy women, of course, need not be mentioned; outdated items have become waste, and they definitely do not want to reuse them. However, in society, we can often see that the trim on hats and handbags, or certain accessories, are made from old dance costumes, and this dance costume is what the person themselves wore before. Therefore, modern economic women still utilize waste. In short, fashion is like cooking, and women have their own skills for tidying up leftovers. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Using American-made lace trim on plain silk cheongsams is very beautiful and charming.</p>
<p>Hongxiang Company to Hold Fashion Show Today</p>
<p>Today is the 17th anniversary of Hongxiang Company, and they will hold a Sino-Western fashion show. The time is from 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM today, at the art hall on the second floor of Hongxiang's head office on Jing'an Temple Road. Printed sample price lists of the latest 1934 autumn and winter overcoats and exquisite programs will be distributed to guests, and refreshments will be provided. Invitations have already been sent out, but due to the large number of customers, delivery may be incomplete. We hope you will attend and visit.</p>
<p>In addition, the company will be temporarily closed for half a day this afternoon to entertain guests at the fashion show. Business will resume as usual from tomorrow.</p>
<p>Madam Niu Sujuan's Attire for Today's Hongxiang Fashion Show</p>
<p>New Attire Designed and Patterned by Hongxiang's Jin Yixiang</p>
<p>Color Over Quality</p>
<p>Yanqiao</p>
<p>Every time I stroll on the street, I see the women coming and going, all colorful, as if I have arrived at a wallpaper shop flipping through samples, which is really dazzling. I feel that many women, although the styles are very fashionable and the materials are very luxurious, the colors used are not good, not only are they not beautiful, but also somewhat annoying. Therefore, I say that the first thing to research in new clothes is the color scheme, just like a painting, the colors used must also be appropriately arranged. If it is just red flowers and green leaves, it will naturally be annoying.</p>
<p>Color is not only related to the style and material of the clothing, but also to age. Foreign women are more particular about this point than Chinese women. Some women, despite being old, still wear an extremely thin, brand-new, and very delicate colored dress, instantly adding a lot of charm and reducing a lot of age. However, some women who are really too old and too ugly still wear young girls' clothes, making them even more repulsive, like an old house with modern electric lights installed, the more dazzling, the more obvious the gray and decadent appearance of cobwebs and dust.</p>
<p>There is another point: the color of clothes is also related to the seasons and climate. Ancient Chinese poets also had the term "spring clothes." With spring clothes, there are naturally also summer clothes, autumn clothes, and winter clothes. Although there is no specific explanation of how to combine spring clothes, we know that previous clothes paid attention to color based on various observations and speculations. Because at that time, there were not as many "various colors" and "various names" as there are today. They could only strive for victory in color.</p>
<p>Therefore, new clothes emphasize color, which is the same in China and abroad, and consistent throughout ancient and modern times. As for the material, it is the most ordinary. Whether it is silk or cloth, some girls wear cloth clothes and are very slender and cute, while some girls spend a lot of money to buy foreign silk, and wearing it is far inferior. I am a "complete layman" when it comes to women's new clothes, just saying a few words randomly. Please discuss whether they are right or wrong.</p>

<p>Talking About Eating and Working</p>
<p>Zhixing</p>
<p>Generally speaking, in today's Chinese society, we only see people eating, and we do not see many people working, although it is not dogmatic to say that there are no people working.</p>
<p>Eating is inherently a very important thing. If people don't eat, they will inevitably cease to exist. However, there is a way to eat. A well-known Western saying goes: Do people live to eat, or eat to live? It is clear that it is not because the world is piled up with many foods that you and I are born to consume them, but rather that people eat to survive. From this, we can know that there are two ways to eat: one is to "eat" for the sake of "eating," and the other is to "eat" for the sake of "survival." To eat for the sake of eating, I think all things with a mouth and life would not do this, because since they have life, they must maintain the survival of their life. To maintain the survival of life, they open their mouths to eat. This is not eating for the sake of eating, but eating for the sake of survival. However, there are indeed many people eating for the sake of eating today.</p>
<p>People are ultimately living animals. They don't just have a mouth, do they? Why are there so many people who only care about opening their mouths to eat? Have they even forgotten to maintain their own lives? Absolutely not, they are actually forced to eat out of the need to survive. If they don't eat, they will perish. However, this is only them thinking about themselves as individuals and not thinking about the whole society. I said earlier that eating for the sake of survival contains a significant social meaning. Because people ultimately cannot survive apart from society, people ultimately have their individual survival in a surviving society, people ultimately end with society, society survives, people survive; society dies, people must die. Eating for the sake of survival does not only contain individual meaning, but also has an expanded social meaning. From this social point of view, it can be seen that eating for individual survival is just eating for the sake of eating. There is no true meaning of "living."</p>
<p>The great Greek philosopher Aristotle said, "Man is a social animal." This is indeed an unshakeable truth. If we want to survive, if we want to eat, we must make society continue to survive and expand the life of society. That is to say, we must work for society, we must do things for society. In this way, we can also have food to eat, continue to live, and live a stable and comfortable life continuously. If we do not work, if we do not do things, and only seek to eat, this is just a passive, physiological act of seeking survival. Only animals other than humans are like this! Everyone knows that animals can only obtain the existing things given by nature from the natural world to prolong their lives! But humans are absolutely not like this. Their will to survive is active; not only physiological, they also have to use their physical and mental strength to work, to do things, to excavate their living materials from the natural world. Therefore, human material culture can develop, spiritual culture can grow, and society can advance step by step in the process of cosmic evolution, and my life can also climb step by step towards the heights of life.</p>
<p>From what has been said above, it is clear that we know that people do not eat to eat, do not seek narrow survival, but eat to work, to seek broad survival. People can only obtain narrow individual survival by seeking broad social survival. Chinese society is really terrible. Everyone only cares about opening their mouths to eat, and very, very few people use their hands, feet, heads, and brains, and physical and mental strength to work and do things. These people who only care about eating are simply robbers, thieves, and bandits. If this kind of plundering and stealing behavior continues endlessly, society will inevitably regress, fall into ruin, and the entire nation will inevitably decline, fall into ruin along with it. Young people, young people of the era, let us not be people who only eat, but be people who truly and honestly do things for society!</p>
<h3>Origin of the Dispute</h3>
<p>The Yangshupu British American Tobacco Company's Third Factory employs over three thousand six hundred workers. Feeling repeatedly oppressed by the factory, they collectively decided to organize the British American Tobacco Office of the Shanghai Fourth District Cigarette Industry Workers' Union. The general assembly then presented conditions for improved treatment and sent a letter to the factory requesting acceptance. Having received no reply, yesterday at eleven o'clock in the morning, they again sent representative Chen Shikui to negotiate with the factory. As a result, the manager's attitude was firm and he refused to accept the demands, which aroused the workers' indignation.</p>
<h3>Declaration of Strike</h3>
<p>After the worker representative Chen Shikui negotiated with the factory without result, all the workers were filled with indignation. Consequently, over two thousand workers from the tobacco shredding room, packing room, box room, coppersmith shop, and tobacco leaf room, all stayed in the factory from one o'clock in the morning, ceasing work and declaring a strike. Over one thousand female workers from the tin foil wrapping room, cigarette rolling room, etc., did not join.</p>
<h3>Six Demands</h3>
<p>The workers came up with the following six demands: (1) Recognize the British American Tobacco Office's right to represent all workers; (2) Three days of wages should be immediately paid for the previous strike period; (3) Permit the union to send personnel to collect dues within the factory; (4) A notice board should be set up in the factory, allowing the union to post notices; (5) A daily subsidy of five hundred yuan for union operating expenses; (6) Chen Shikui and others who were dismissed because of the union should all be reinstated.</p>
<h3>Emergency Meeting</h3>
<p>After all the workers declared a strike, in order to discuss countermeasures, representatives from each department, numbering over two hundred and fifty people, convened a temporary emergency meeting at eight o'clock last night to discuss countermeasures.</p>
<h3>Persuasion to Resume Work</h3>
<p>Upon receiving the report that the workers of the British American Tobacco Third Factory declared a strike because the factory refused to accept the conditions, the Shanghai General Labour Union's Standing Committee decided that, in order to avoid escalating the matter, the workers should be ordered to resume work first thing this morning and await the authorities' legal mediation. Committee member Zhou Xuexiang was assigned to be responsible for persuasion.</p>
<h3>### Exhibition of Japanese Aggression Pictures at the Minhang People's Education Center</h3>
<p>In order to promote patriotism and popular education, Mr. Jin Zuobao, the director of the Shanghai County Minhang People's Education Center, has specially collected hundreds of kinds of pictures depicting the history of Japanese aggression against China. They are being exhibited in the new building's activity room of the center. Each picture is vivid and extraordinarily moving, and is accompanied by alarming and easily understood textual explanations. Therefore, viewers can understand everything at a glance. The number of visitors has reached more than a thousand. It is said that these pictures are changed and exhibited daily.</p>
<h3>### The Export Department Temporarily Allows Colored Tea Exports with Flexibility; Starting from the New Tea Season Next Year, the Regulations on the Prohibition of Colored Tea Will Be Enforced</h3>
<p>The prohibition of exporting colored tea was previously approved and promulgated by the Ministry after being passed by the First National Commodity Inspection Technology Conference. After the Commodity Inspection Bureau was ordered to implement it, various tea merchants repeatedly requested remedies due to ongoing difficulties. The Bureau, in consideration of the merchants' situation, specially presented the facts and requested instructions from the Ministry. Now it has been ordered to temporarily allow flexible handling within this year. Starting from the new tea season next year, the regulations on the prohibition of colored tea will be strictly enforced.</p>
