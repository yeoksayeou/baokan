<h3 id="c1">日蘇衝突激劇明 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>中東路扣車問題。已成爲蘇僞間紛爭之焦點。僞國要求蘇聯交還車輛最後之時間爲五月十日。距今僅餘三天。在蘇聯方面。并無交還該項車輛之具體表示。而傀儡方面。且放言將採取斷然處置。以武力封鎖綏芬。不顧一切。憑日本之强力奪取中東路。又復播散日本將以「金力」收買中東路之傳說。使蘇聯感於軍事的與經濟的二重圍攻。益以資本主義各國聯合行動。覺在國際關係上。發生更大之困難。同時日本侵入東北之軍隊。於四月十八日經綏芬侵入蘇境。其表面係借口於蘇警阻止日軍淸匪。致有此「日軍入蘇境」之舉動。而據日本外務當局聲稱。則謂無侵犯蘇聯領土之惡意。且云中東路問題爲蘇聯與「滿洲」問題。與日本殊無直接關係。吾人固深知所謂「滿洲國」者。在前則純爲日本軍國主義之傀儡。至於今日。則已成爲日本之家奴。此爲世界各國所共知。蘇聯與吉黑兩省爲緊隣。其見聞當較其他各國爲詳確。况中東路横貫北滿。對日本帝國主義一切陰謀詭計。尤必具切實之認識耶。是故蘇聯遠東軍司令白魯謙將軍。於五一勞動節在伯力公開演說。謂「今年吾輩生活於緊張之國際局勢中。其緊張程度。實爲前此所未見。無論何時吾輩當以鐡拳對待侵犯蘇聯領土者。并保衛革命所得勝利」白魯廉將軍。洵爲對日主戰者。但以紀律森嚴之蘇聯。决不致在日蘇關係緊張之際。故作危言。東京縱欲强詞自辯。以第三者自居。其如東三省境内遍佈日兵。關東軍司令之權力巳支配東北一切之事實何。</p>
<p>日軍發動九一八事變之初。即以壓服赤化封鎖蘇聯取得當世列强之諒解。亦以此脅制蘇聯使取守勢。其所謂大陸政策。以兼併「滿蒙」爲其主要部分。但在兼併政策未能實施之前。只在侵略我國之土地。雖設爲種種說詞。亦不過爲遂行此種政策之手段。而對列强。無論爲英美爲蘇聯。被均不惜與之週旋。以期其大陸睡策之實現。其對蘇外交。尤爲曲折迂廻。蓋彼審知蘇聯方集其全力於「五年計劃」。决不致分心於東北之事變也。及至在遼吉得手。傀儡登場。日本席捲東三省之勢。旣巳形成。而中東鐡路遂爲彼眼中釘矣。然則中東路扣車問題。蘇聯堅持不還。傀儡必欲以封鎖國境相脅　。蘇日之間。是否即以蘇僞衝突。而至於砲火相見乎。</p>
<p>就目前一般形勢推測。蘇日衝突。雖日趨激化。最後之結算。終將不免於一戰。然以實際情勢論。日本尙不敢單獨對蘇開戰。以自陷於悲境。蓋日本陸軍縱自謂不弱於人。惟於機械化之設備。殊較列國爲落後。化學戰鬥之種種工具更不如人。立體戰爭唯一武器之飛機。較之蘇聯。殆有望塵莫及之慨。矧近代戰爭决勝之點。不在疆塲而在其國民經濟之實力。當今世界經濟恐慌。日趨深化。主要各國所領導之經濟聯盟。益見强烈。日本東受受之威脅。西或英帝國經濟聯盟之挾制。其全國國富。據最近發表一九三○年之調查。總數雖較一九二四年當時爲多。而個人平均。則減少二十一元日金。况現時日本金元。僅有平價二分之一。其國力之衰退。由此即可概見。加以英日經濟關係。頗欠圓滿。日美之間。烈痕尤深。設無國際的援助。日本帝國主義者雖横。亦必不敢輕於對蘇挑戰</p>
<p>反之。蘇聯國力。蒸蒸日上。其工業建設。旣不下於日本。鋼鐡煤油以及煤炭。三種戰爭原素。更駕日本而上之。至於軍事上一切整備。「五年計劃」實施以來。愈見充實。戰獨對日作戰。不難穩操勝算。不過蘇聯在主義上在實際利害上。其敵人非日本一國。如非被迫至萬不獲已時。亦决不至嘗試戰爭。以自毁其旣得勝利之基礎。况彼確知日美對立。無法消除。法德與法意關係。萬難圓滿。蘇聯將靜觀太平洋風雲之激變。坐視歐洲各國之鬥爭。以徐　自身之發展。續持歷來之和平政策。</p>
<p>據此以觀測中東路問題。無論爲日爲蘇。均不肯單獨挑戰。必有待世界其他各國間之變化。日本雖爲國際變局中要角之一。但在對英經濟關係未能圓滿解决之前。對蘇戰爭。仍恐其宣傳多過事實也。</p>

<p>德俄關係復穩固</p>
<p>李維諾夫與德大使換文</p>
<p>延長柏林拉拍羅等條約</p>
<p>德蘇兩政府均表示欣慰</p>
<p>德國不得志於中歐蘇俄正有事於遠東</p>
<p>塔斯五日莫斯科電據此間公布消息、今日蘇聯外長李維諾夫與德國駐蘇聯大使竇克遊換文、延長一九三一年六月二十四日之莫斯科議定書、一九二六年四月二十四日之德蘇柏林條約、及一九二九年一月二十五日之德蘇調解夁定、按柏林條約及拉伯羅條約爲德蘇關係之基礎、此次條約協定之延長、爲兩國關係上可以滿意之一遜云、</p>
<p>路透五日柏林電今日德政府對於德俄兩國友誼愈趨穩固、表示極大欣慰、以前各方曾深以德國政府採行反共政策、蘇俄或將拒絶批准爲慮、</p>
<p>國民五日柏林電一九三一年六月二十四日所訂之議定書現已批准、該議定　聲明、德俄雙方政府、鑒於兩國邦交素篤、並爲此後極力合作、以期保障共同之和平起見、故已同意於俄德諸條約之繼續、俄德條約中最重要部份、即爲規定兩國之間、倘有一國被第三者攻擊之時、其他一國應即嚴守寛大之中立、並不得贊助其他國家對於條約對方國施行任何經濟排斥之舉、近則復附加一欵、訂明柏林條約與仲裁條約同時進行、如一方擬中止該約時、可於一年之前通知他方、但不得較早於本年六月三十日云、</p>
<p>塔斯六日莫斯科電蘇聯政府公報伊凡士斯太今日於「力求鞏固和平」之標題下刋一社論、論德蘇條約之延長、其言云、拉伯羅　約及柏林條約曾被其他資本國家視爲一烟幕、以掩蔽一共同對付他國之德蘇密約者、拉伯羅條約成立以來已達十一年、柏林條約成立以來已達七年、其間之經過、證明上述之誣指爲不確、此種條約對於德蘇政治經濟關係之增進、大有助益、惟不致妨礙兩國對於其他國家之關係、在蘇聯方面、此種條約並不妨礙彼之和平努力及與法波之訂立不侵犯條約、此點即可爲拉伯羅條約非對付他國之證明、不幸在近年來、德國漸顯示一種離棄拉伯羅條約而與英或法聯合對付蘇聯之傾向、此種傾向不僅見於宣傳、且見於一部分政治家之行爲、僅未成功而已、蓋法蘇之關係已大增進、使德法成立一軍事同盟以共同對付蘇聯之計劃、不能得到法國政治家之響應、故最近德國反對與蘇聯友善之政策、結果僅足㓕弱其本身之地位、蘇聯輿論對於柏林條約之延長、表示完全之贊成、雖彼等對於法西斯主義未抱同情、而其樂望與德國共守和平、其認德蘇邦交發展爲雙方之共同利益、則固無問題也、蘇聯對於德國之政策、未有一刻離去和平、蘇聯輿論於歡迎延長條約之際、深信此舉必引起答簽字雙方相符之具體行爲、柏林條約將與蘇聯政府與其他國家所訂之不侵犯條約、成爲蘇聯在歐洲之政策之基礎、在經濟及政治方面、此種條約對於雙方均將有重要之價値云、</p>

<p>拓殖奢望業已放業</p>

<p>國民六日柏林電每日電聞昨載德總理希特勒與佛萊塞爵士之談片、謂德國已放棄海外拓殖之希望、此言引起一般人之印象、以爲德國卒已放棄對其前殖民地之要求、惟德國政界聲稱、希特勒之言、並不含有此意、希氏僅述及英國海外之利益、德國當然須加尊重耳、</p>

<p>哈瓦斯五日倫敦電德總理希特勒派其親信羅森培來英、此間標準晚報」解釋此事、謂羅氏此行係欲觀察英國人士對於德國新政治究竟作何感想、又意　墨索里尼、以國社黨行動過於激烈、引起英國人士不良之印象曾勸德國黨局强自抑制、羅氏來英、或在緩和英國感情云</p>

<p>路透五日日内瓦電英國軍縮計畫之德國修正文、今日已發展載有出人意外之廢除潛艇一條、若此修正文果被通過、</p>
<p>則德國將擔任在一九三六年前對於水面軍艦不得超過前所給予德國之限度、並擔任增造新艦、以代廢艦、僅以一艘爲限、但若潛艇不廢、則德國保留推翻此議之權、德國修正文對於空軍亦有大加裁减之提議、主張海陸飛機在公約實施一年内應銷毁半數、餘者在次年底以前亦銷毁之、如是德國準備接受民用飛機之有效的管理、</p>
<p>國民五日日内瓦電德國所提出關於英國軍縮草約之修正案、建議凡一切戰鬥飛機及空中轟炸俱應一律廢止、此外則民用飛機亦須加以確實管理、以防其改作軍事用途、該修正案之字句係借用凡爾賽和約者、再則德國修正案復對於海軍之減縮、聲明德國在一九三六年年終以前、决不超過其應有之海面船隻數目、而對於陳舊軍艦、亦不建築新艦代替</p>

<p>現在開放政權事　　、爭執頗烈、實則開放與否、均非澈底辦法、爭者、與國民黨執政者、均有錯誤、因總理以前所以主張訓政、係對待當時曹錕之頒佈賄選憲法、因總理鑒於民衆無政治知識、致政權爲少數人所操縱、以前之選舉、即其明證、故必須有知識之執政者、將人民加以訓練、由下層作起、如先成立縣議會等、現在各縣尙毫無組織、人民之無知識也仍舊、只少數稍有知識者、爭開放政權、結果、仍被其操縱、但執政者亦不能存多執幾年政權多做幾年官之思想、必須積極訓練民衆、至於徒要求開放政權亦不能解决國難、要解决國難、必須要集中力量、一致對外、譬如一家人、遭土匪搶刦、必須衆兄弟一齊努力、方能抵抗匪衆、保護一家安全、</p>
<p>敎育救國要點</p>
<p>敎育是最大問題、中國向來是注重道德、但是第一注重道德、第二要有處斷事情的能力、能力要運用的好、最爲重要、現在之蘇俄、其主義如何、我們不要講、只看他革命成功後、五年計畫、十年計畫、依次實行、孜孜進步、實可畏人、所以最要緊是要先充足力量、甲午戰時、中國打了敗仗、那時便應努力自强、譬如兩人打仗、其一被打敗、拱手曰、「五年後再見」、自此之後、即努力練習武藝、先時比仿打棉花、隔一尺使你疼、後來隔五尺即可打的你疼、五年以後、必然能將敵人打敗、敵人亦將向我拱手、中國在甲午後、所得敎訓、即呈攻防不足、應當發奮自强、但現時的中國、第一、農村破産、需要生産力量、第二、要抵制外貨、必須要提倡國貨、不然、便無辦法、第三、要有機槍大砲、現在中國吃虧處、即在此三點、和·戰·均不能、所以作一面交涉一面抵抗之無聊對付、可笑亦復可憐、在民衆是無拳無勇、現在之大刀救國、亦殊不對、但是自甲午後、雖得敎訓、而仍不能發奮自强、此種罪過、當由年老的人負其責任、因當甲德戰時、蔣委員長適七歲、今四十年、他已四十七歲、那時我個人已三十一歲、蔣那時年紀小、當然不記得、我們年紀大記得的、實應該早就鼓吹、喚起全國人去自强、但是我未去鼓吹、罪過實無可逃、近見大公報登載梁漱溟還在說風凉話、他說、買大砲是錯了、中國農村破壞、需要組織、但是小組織是無用的、講空洞論理、亦殊不中用、三民主義有其論理、帝國主義有論理、共産主義亦有其論理各不　　　、有提倡孝的、有非孝的　漱溟說、以前買長槍大砲是錯了、最要緊的是組織農村云云、那眞是他錯了、我們曉得、中國長槍大砲是打自己行、打别人不行、眞是笑話、以前學法政、學一切洋八股的、多愛說空洞論理中國之壞、此其最大原因、現在不知甲午者、或覺不利害、又如外交、咸豐十年、兩廣總督葉名琛、被英人擄去死了、還給他穿上頂帽袍褂、陳列在博物院、並抬着滿街游行、看書上的、或不信如此利害、看見的當然知道、就應該發奮自强、但是四十年來還是如此、不知待諸何年、如敵人以大砲來、我以大砲去猶可、今者人以大砲來、我以大刀去、勇則勇矣、其如太辛苦何、現在之時局、據余觀察、殊爲難辦、但恐怕日本亦向死路上走去、如歐戰前之德國然、我勸敎育界不要只爭敎育經費、警如以前衙門中的老夫子、待遇薄而位尊、我想起一段故事昔時一公館請一老夫子、待遇甚薄、一日、老夫子行廚房外、聞廚役在内切菜、一方自語云、這是老夫子的、這是太太的、老爺的、以至最後是帳房的、迨進内看視、所切乃是竹筍、最不好的是根、　以先給老夫子、最好的頂尖、所以給帳房、過後數日、又行經廚房外、聽廚役切菜、仍在自語、先切給帳房、以次老爺太太、最後方是老夫子、老夫子暗喜、以爲可吃好竹筍矣、但進内看視、所切者乃是韭菜、因韮菜根爲貴、韮葉爲最次也、老夫子空歡喜一場、廢然而去、所以凡事自反、譬仿自己兒子不好、家必不能興起、必須先求自己兒子能工作、如民衆智識太淺溥、徒爭政　何用、以往的過去罪過在我們年老的、我們應該受槍斃、但你們不要再如我們一樣、尤其言論界、對於敎育、不要放鬆、天生一個人、有耳目口鼻智識的工具、但要求智識、必須去學、（一）人生至二十歲、是求智識時期、二十至六十、爲作事時期、六十至八十、則需人來帮助、（二）得到敎育的、生活比較好、剛出世時、固一赤條條的小孩（三）敎育是爲國家的、經費是有限的、譬如一家人多、所有之錢、不足以供給多數人上學、只可供給少數人、使之學有成就、從前求學、是爲個人謀出路、但是你個人有出路、國家却無出路了去學洋八股、縱然得到博士、不去爲國家着想、鬧的個不亦樂乎、一個偏要訓政、一個却要開放政權、都非澈底辦法、但我不過隨便談談云、（四日　）</p>

<p>陳銘樞抵港</p>
<p>據戴氏云、陳眞如返國消息、余於滬友間得其電告、今日（六日）可以抵港矣、現楊建平及其夫人、已於日前赴港歡迎、至於陳氏返國後、是否即須來滬、現尙未得確訊、惟報載謂陳氏將出主粤省主席說、則非事實、</p>
<p>十九軍行程</p>
<p>十九路軍北上抗日部隊、自抵粤後、原擬會齊兩粤抗日軍隊同時出發、嗣因兩粤部隊、尙未準備就緒、故已先行開拔北上、以示决心、惟因交通上感受種種不便、致紆迴曲折·步行甚遲、但其北上抗日之决心始終如一、蓋視其自閩開粤及現在之實行出發可知矣、按十九路軍北上抗日之動機、尙在熱河未失以前、當時本人亦曾以此事買獻其意見於當局、冀以十九路軍過去之精神、一振華北未經抗日軍隊之氣、結果事與願違、軍未出而熱河已失、茲雖積極趕程北上、欲爲亡羊補牢之計、然其困難巳倍蓰於前矣、</p>
<p>航空與防空</p>
<p>滬上航空救國捐、經此次熱烈捐募後、現報告結果、巳得一百餘萬、但與所懸目的、相差尙鉅、希望在此展期之中、大家能繼續努力、以達此成數、惟以現有之數、購買飛機、力量實覺太少、故於防空上言、飛機力量之較優於高射砲、固亦確有相當見地、但財力不濟、不能多購、與其相形見絀、似以購高射砲爲是、惟亦必佐之以驅逐機、方能完備、同時我國航空人才、雖有自海外歸來者及粤省所訓練者、然皆習於商用機、於空中戰鬥上之指揮聯絡等等、尙缺乏經騐、故於此一致航空救國聲中、對於航空人才之如何訓練、尤宜三致意也、</p>

<p>日兵往來鬧市</p>
<p>引起外間評議</p>
<p>日令事署解釋</p>
<p>大美晚報云、邇來時有日海軍巡邏兵士出入南京路靜安寺路、至兆豐公園一帶、曾引起外間紛紛評議、今日（六日）據日領事署某君云、日本登陸兵士之請假出外者、所至地方、前曾限於虹口附近、現因時局和緩、業與市政府及工部局商妥、日兵之請假出外者、得往來　京路靜安寺路、遠至兆豐公園、並許往來閘北沿寳山路江灣路、而至日本墳山一帶、因此在日兵所至地方、派兵巡邏、以便遇有日兵滋事時、即交巡邏兵帶回、例如當去年發生軍事行動之時、直至今日、凡請假美兵所常往地方、時派美兵巡邏、此種慣例、自亦適用於日軍及其他各國軍隊、至此次新辦法、係在四月初商妥、惟日兵之巡邏者、通常僅在星期六星期日及例假日、</p>
<p>檢查工廠案</p>
<p>租界當局力謀妥協</p>
<p>市政府態度尙未表示</p>
<p>如主權無礙或可接受</p>

<p>租界情形工部局企圖攫奪我方在租界内檢查工廠權、并由納稅西人會特别大會修改洋涇浜章程附律、蓋租界當局亦深知租界内各工廠之一切設備及衛生等、殊欠完備、與工廠安全關係實大、茲因覽於我方嚴重反對、擬謀一折衷辦法、以資妥協、聞該折衷辦法内容、由工部局組織一工廠檢查處、聘任我方檢查工廠班之訓練員爲檢查員、其最高職權、須操之於租界當局、惟市府亦有權干預、</p>
<p>市府態度市政府對於修改洋涇　　浜章程附律第三十四條、早已一再嚴重聲明反對、蓋檢查租界内工廠、係我國主權决不因其單獨主張而被攫喪失、至於領事團方面聲稱將謀得一折衷辦法、以解决此項問題、市府對此不欲有所表示、總之、如謀得一妥全辦法、與我方檢查工廠主權無衝突時、或可接受也、</p>
<p>廠方反對租界區域内華人開設之各工廠當局、對於工部局修改洋涇浜章程附律、希圖越權檢查、都表示不願認受、中華國貨維持會·上海市民提倡國貨會等、均曾集商反對辦法、并有主張自行組織國貨工廠檢查委員會、自動檢查、藉謀工廠之安全云、</p>

<p>丨先後拘獲綁匪三人丨</p>

<p>遂開始談判</p>

<p>日貨坩鍋傾銷後</p>
<p>中外商大受影響</p>
<p>價格較未傾銷時跌落三四十元</p>
<p>我國上游之銷路尙能勉强維持</p>
<p>華商表示誓必堅持到底</p>
<p>坩鍋（即石墨）一物、爲近世工業上主要品之一、且全世界産地界常稀少、查我全國發現是項礦産者、有湖南·廣東·浙江·陜西·等省、而開採以後、著有成效堪與舶來品相頡頏者、僅江蘇下蜀之江家山烏岡山利民公司一處、至日本本國、並無此項礦産、其運滬傾銷者、礦區半在朝鮮、半在我國之安東、日旣佔我東省、礦産亦即爲彼所攫奪、陜西近雖有該礦之發現、但以經濟關係、尙未能即時開採、其餘則因質量不佳、或因交通不便、均未能運滬銷售、近因日貨在滬傾銷、不特華商受其影響、美貨亦因此而較爲停滯、申時社記者特往各方調查、爰將所得結果、分述於左、</p>
<p>出産調查</p>
<p>此項礦産、在遠東方面、屬於我國者、爲湖南·廣東·浙江·陜西·等處、在江蘇則爲句容縣之下蜀鎭一帶、墨於日本者、半在朝鮮境、半在我國之安東縣、該礦本屬我有、今爲日人所攫奪、全年出産、下蜀至少五六百噸、至多三四千噸、如經濟問題能解决、隨時可以擴充、</p>
<p>行廠統計</p>
<p>經理或販賣是項礦産之公司、可分三　、屬於中國者、爲利民·　興·廣濟·同濟·利豐·等五家、其經售均爲完全國産、同德·同興·兩家、有時購自國産、有時則購日貨、完全經售日貨者、爲信記工業原料行、　餘·耀華·兩家、商標則利民用、警鐘、寳興用寳石、信記用甜心式中印信記二字、惟該廠時向日本購進礦塊、自亂機製粉、冒充國産、每噸十包、外印完全國貨字樣、耀華則商標不明、至美貨並非天然品、有用煤製成、故品質極高、價亦特昂、</p>
<p>吕質比較</p>
<p>美貨以煤製成、故其品質能駕天然品而上之、查其化騐含炭分達九十五一度、日貨則分三十八度五、一爲六十八度四、惟目下國貨正在積極改良中、其目標務必達到超出日貨之上、而與美貨並驅、</p>
<p>各貨銷路</p>
<p>是項礦産、銷路最旺者爲本埠、其次則爲沿長江各埠、其最大用　約有八種、（一）製造乾電池、（二）炭精、（三）鉛筆、（四）翻砂、（五）冶金、（六）煤爐粉、（七）　磗、及其他電料用品、關稅方面定爲値百抽五、惟國貨較日貨、則須增加一二五附稅、</p>
<p>傾銷情形</p>
<p>各貨市價、日貨在未傾銷前、甲種一百六十元、乙種一百三十元、丙種一百十元、國貨甲種九十元、至一百二十元、乙種六十元至九十元、茲日商企圖達到獨覇我國市塲起見、實行傾銷政策、甲乙丙各貨、逐步下跌、目下行市較未跌時、相去况達四十元之鉅、中外各商、所受影響、在上海方面、達百分之二十、惟據某華商表示、日貨無論如何傾銷、我國商已有充分之預備、必堅持到底、不稍退讓、一面希望各界勿用仇貨、以博最後勝利、</p>
<p>不允減稅</p>
<p>我國土産、旣受日貨排擠、在事實上、彼日方有政府爲　盾、我則運銷於本國、　轉至他埠、卽須重行納稅、且海關方面、更須加一二附稅、實際上國産稅額、多較　來品爲高、欲長期抵抗、勢非設法减低稅額不可、據利民公司之經理章君語申時社記者云、已數度向財部接洽、要求减去附稅、以謀國貨之生存、惟財部以茲事體大、未　允准、此次鐡道部全國鐡路沿綫出産貨品展覽會結束時、兩路局是黄伯樵氏、曾表示將來對於　貨運費、可照現　八折計算、以資救濟、果能實現、於國産運銷、不無小補、</p>
<p>充當茶役、現則賦閒在家、巳有數年、其妻馮氏、生一子、名水　、現巳長成、母子二人、均在某襪廠内作工度日、但所入甚微、故終不　應用、賃居於愛文義路七百九十九號勝飛脚踏車行三層擱上、袁前曾患有惡疾、現忽復發、致貧病交加、益覺懊惱不巳、頓萌厭世之念、於前日其妻子外出之際當將繩索一根懸樑自缢、嗣經該車行夥友談金林幣見、即將其設法解下、然僅氣存一息乃即報告靜安寺捕房、飭派華探朱尙和前往調查之下、將其送往寳隆醫院醫治罔效、旋即身死、乃將尸體舁入斐倫路騐尸所、昨晨、報第一特區地方法院、委派郭煒檢察官蒞所、騐明尸體、升座公案、訊據尸妻袁馮氏投稱、余夫巳有三年無相當職業、致經濟異常拮据、家内所有衣服物件、均巳典質一空、近彼又舊病復發、余母子二人、難作苦工生活、亦不怨他、此次彼忽自縊、恐係貧病所致云云、郭君得供、遂諭騐得死者袁雲泉、委係生前自縊身死、尸交其妻袁馮氏具結領回棺殮、</p>

<p>讀者顧問</p>
<p>只有這一條路</p>
<p>丨松江周鑫坤君來信丨</p>
<p>貴報的讀者顧問這一欄，是最好的討論園地。我現在把個問題提出來請敎，我家本屬小康，我在五歲之時，不幸失怙，日後家境方面，就此漸漸困窘。後來母親携着我遷移到下鄕去，那時我在八九歲的時候，進了下鄕的小學校，然而家中的生活，敷衍數年之後，實在難以應付。而我讀書的學費，也勉强供給我。日後託親戚之助，進了半工半讀的學校，沒有數年，學校中因發生風潮之故，就此中途輟學，而我再想繼續轉移到他校去求學，因爲受了金錢方面的打擊，可恨的金錢，金錢是不是萬惡麽，有錢萬事多可奮鬥，無錢何以一事多不能奮鬭呢，後來不得已而抛棄了學業，在那時不過十五六歲的靑年，受了一些小學的知識，投到這茫茫的人海裏去謀生。而後託友人之介紹，也算幸運找到一個商界的事業，只好從學徒地位做起。那時我的思想，祗要能夠去做，何事不爲成功呢，工作數年後，因環境壓迫的關係，又因尶𡯓的緣故，那是沒奈何只得辭去職業。自從失業之後，至今將近二載，託親戚朋友四處去謀事，至今沒有設法之處，而自己更沒有能力去設法。如今日之社會想謀事，非有高深之學問，能作偉大之事業，然而我也不懊悔失學之苦，爲了金錢所束缚也。常言說：「只有錦上添花，那得雪中送炭」。就此而觀，無財無勢的人們，就不能同前希望嗎，我現在或者去做高上的事業，恐怕扶别不起，　夫　下　的工作，恐淹沒體面，欲　比較　　　　者去做。望至今日一無所有。然而我鼓起着精神，而沒有相當的地位，我現在擔憂着我的前途，在進退的歧路上徘徊着，今將如何方法前進呢，先生能指示以應取怎樣相當的途徑敎我！</p>
<p>答：來書讀悉，悉謀生困難，是今日普遍的現象，自然依常理論，謀生必有相當技能，才有希望，然而這必須是眞正的自由平等的社會，現在是有錢有勢的人的社會，實在是如你所說的「只有錦上添花，那有雪裏送炭？」，眞正有相當技能的人，並不見得都有工作，而有工作，甚至盤據要津的，也不見得是有相當技能的，更不見得「非有高深之學問」才能做如足下所意想的「偉大之事業」，所以古人說，「肉食者鄙，未能遠謀」，大凡陞官發財的人或集團，大都是腦滿腸肥，他們的智識文化必日趨於退步，他們的生命必日趨於沒落，歷史告訴我們，絲毫不爽，這是一。</p>
<p>足下是個小康出身，意識形態還是不脫穿長衫的朋友們的範疇，想必兩隻手拿出來都是雪白乾凈的，說出話來斯斯文文的，自己在屋裏廂，拭桌子掃地，恐怕都有點羞怯的，無怪乎你「想去做下層工作，恐淹沒體面！」，這也難怪你，這是倒楣的階級社會，現有制度的門閥觀念害了你，朋友，趕快把這種臭觀念送到垃圾桶裏去吧。不要再作夢，趕快去一個工廠去做小工，或借三五塊錢去做小買賣，先把口糊着再說，這樣總比在大街上或是向着親戚朋友手面朝下做癟三好，而且將來的世界，就是灰鼻灰眼，胼手胝足的朋友們的世界，只有這一條路，向前進吧，沒有歧路給你徘徊，切不要再那樣「身住寒窰，相府排調」，這是二。</p>

<h3 id="c2">天空作字 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>在最近十年來，我屢得着一個怪夢：夢見我有一種本領，隨意寫了幾個字，會得擴大數千倍，映射在天空中，閃閃地發出光來。我告訴了朋友，有人說：「這是看了電影以後的幻想。」又有人說：「將來科學發達，天空作字也有實現的可能。</p>
<p>上月，買到一部方植之先生的儀衛軒詩集，他有一首「雲書」的七律，中間有一句「靑天垂象借雲書。」這首詩是有小序的，略說：「平生多異夢。非人間想；憶少時，夢天上現「忠孝廉節」四大字，方徑丈餘，靑色。筆力勁挺，似顔柳，體甚可愛。自後數夢天上現字，字稍小而漸多，方不過徑尺，或兩行，或數十行，當時頗能誦其文，醒遂不記。」可見古人已先我做過這個天空作字的幻夢，所差異的，只是不會閃閃發光罷了。　　本年勞働節，德國慶祝五一紀念，有空的盛况；在屯貝何佛練兵塲演放盛大燄火，空中出現「德國復興矣」的字樣。唉！天空作字的幻想，難道眞個實現了麽？道光年間方植之先生所做的「雲書」奇夢，和我近十年來所做的「天空字幕」的怪夢，難道都有化幻爲眞的可能性麽？</p>
<p>仗着燄火在空中出現字樣，並非空前的發明；但，繼續研究起來，總有一天，把一行行的字都寫上了蔚藍的巨幅雲箋。</p>
<h3 id="c3">農村消息 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>— 石顔也</p>
<p>丨農夫之血淚譚丨</p>
<p>一位甫踏進都市而面有菜色的農夫凄慘地對我訴說農村之沒落。他是京滬路中樞號稱江南富庶之地的人。他說：當此春日·正是農村最難過的日子，因爲家中糧食已空，田裏的麥又沒有熟，所說靑黄不接，就是這個時候。每個村莊上，平均起來，食米充足的人家祇有十之一二，和食雜糧勉能充飢的也十之一二，其餘便都是巧婦嘆泣的人家了。人不食則死，他們也和富有者一樣寳貴他的生命，自然不肯坐以待斃。於是輾轉設法，弄得一升半升的米，像明珠般的寳愛，取出少許，和以大量村畔自種的菜，煑成一大鍋糊塗粥，雖然薄薄的祇見菜不見米粒，但是一家人也可一碗碗的灌滿枵腹了，這一升半升經過兩三天吃完了，便再輾轉去弄一升半升，他們的日子這樣的挨過去，要挨到廢曆四月底蠶成麥熟才稍有生路。</p>
<p>問他去年田家米收得很豐，爲甚仍和兇年的一樣無食呢？他說：去年一畝三石，當時確曾農夫相與慶於野，不料穀賤傷農，應了一句古話，一石米祇値五六元，百斤穀祇値一二金，收得多，錢變得少，所以名爲豐年，實是兇歲。更以這豐年之名，租稅催得更急，借欵逼得更嚴，無術應付，祇得忍痛把米賤賣了繳納，價愈賤，所去的米愈多，小戶人家到過得怕過的年關，已倉廪一空，今年怎能還有米吃呢？</p>
<p>農村經濟，枯涸得無可言喻，一個數十家的村莊上，要咄嗟間集足十塊大洋，眞是難於上靑天，有時竟會走遍全村，要求一金亦不可得。鄕鎭上也一樣乾枯，揑了一張五元紙幣，到處兌不到現金，乃是常有的事。</p>
<p>最後他又對那連綿不斷的春雨愀然地說：去冬今春，幾番大雪，田間不能工作，麥苗已受傷，現在又遭不斷的雨，田土益濕，適與麥性相反，弄得麥苗起黄，麥根起腐，將來收成，定打折扣，淸明時節，家家種黄豆，種子也爛掉，無芽透出土，蠶又剛孵化，遭此陰雨寒冷，自也自幼受傷，大來必不康健，麥豆蠶這是農家上半年的三大出産，三者都壞，將來的悽慘，還忍說得嗎？</p>
<p>唉！號稱富饒地之農村，已如此沒落，其他地方也可想像得之，我聽他訴說旣畢，也伴着他欷歔了。</p>

<h3 id="c5">醉 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>— 閆重樓</p>
<p>酒吃得過量，神經改變常態，起頭是胡言亂語，繼之以手舞足蹈，最後終於鼾然入夢，這是酒醉的一幕。</p>
<p>醉人的東西不僅限於酒，花的香氣，美的顔色，…都有醉人的魔力。不過各種的醉態不同罷了！</p>
<p>「世上人盡醉！何忍獨爲醒。」這是中國頽廢詩人的哲學。儘管自己知道：醉是一種不良的現象，醉後不免要失德，但是眼看着世上别的人都醉了！自己又何樂而不醉呢？所以這種頽廢哲學，有使全世界人類都陷於「終日昏昏醉夢間」</p>
<p>的危險。</p>
<p>「醉」的最大勢力，六是使人入其中而不自覺，所以東北半壁河山會斷送在醉人的手裏。雖然不抵抗將軍等都是絶口呼寃着，然而因醉心「美人」「烟土」以致遭强寇宰割，终是不可掩的事實。</p>
<p>「醉」臥沙塲君莫笑，古來征戰幾人回。」在國難嚴重的時期，怎麽聽不到這樣悲壯的呼聲？</p>

<p>他啊約了一聲，手扶着房門，向外張望了一下，笑道：原來是殷連長，趙連長，大喜呀，升官發財。請坐罷。他一面說着話，一面在脇下扣着紐扣，笑道：乳孩子的人，眞是沒有辦法，老是敝着胸脯子。他笑着走了出來，趙殷二人在此，也不是外人，就隨便的抱了拳頭，向他拜年。這一間小小的堂屋裏，原只有一張桌子，四把椅子，除了桌子，已經擺上了供物而外，這四張椅子，也都讓大人或小孩子的東西佔據了。袁氏看了這兩位客，只在這滿地芝蔴稭子的屑子上站着，不能落坐。口裏連道着眞是糟，就將椅子上的東西，收的收，檢的檢，胡亂着忙了一陣，又說着請坐請坐。趙自强看着，騰出了一把椅子來，正想坐下去。一低頭，却看到椅子上粘着了一塊。芝蔴糖。拿手去揩擦時，那糖片緊緊的粘在上面，那裏擦得動。關耀武看到，連忙找了一把小刀子來，將椅子板上的糖片，使勁的修括了去，笑道：有孩子的人家，就是這麽着，現在自然是說我們家裏不乾凈。可是你們將來總有這樣一天。殷得仁笑道：總有這麽一天，我可不能有這樣一天。話是說在這裏，你們相信不相信？袁氏一頓忙亂，把東西檢理淸楚了，正端了一把茶壺，三個茶杯子來，向茶几上放着，笑道：殷連長，你說不會有這樣一個日子，這話怎講呢？殷得仁笑道：我說不會有，就不會有，大家向後看罷。關耀武抱了那個小孩子，向袁氏懷裏一伸道：給你抱罷。袁氏：你才抱多大一會子，又不抱了，我還得去作飯呢。趙自强摇了手道：用不着，我們要趕回海甸去吃午飯，至於早飯，我們是在營裏吃過了的。正說着話呢，那孩子却僕啦一聲，褲當裏阿出一陣稀的黄屎來，灑了關耀武一身，由胸襟上淋到褲脚上，斑斑點點，許久兀自點滴着。（六二）</p>

<p>說起來就記得，　然，自從九一八以後，再沒有聽到吳稚老的妙語了，相傳是生了病。現在剛從南昌專電中，飛出一點聲　來，却連改頭換面的，也是自從九一八以後，就再沒有一絲聲息的民族主義文學者們，也來加以冷冷的訕笑。　　爲什麽呢？爲了九一八。</p>
<p>想起來就記得，吳稚老的筆和舌，是盡過很大的任務的，淸末的時候，五四的時候，北伐的時候，淸黨的時候，淸黨以後的還是閙不淸白的時候。然而他現在一開口，却連躱躱閃閃的人物兒也來冷笑了。九一八以來的飛機，眞也炸着了這黨國的元老吳先生，或者是，炸大了一些躱躱閃閃的人物兒的小胆子。</p>
<p>九一八以後，情形就有這魔不同了。</p>
<p>舊書裏有過這麽一個寓言，某朝某帝的時候，宫女們多數生了病，總是醫不好，最後來了一個名醫，開出神方道：壯漢若干名。皇帝沒有法，只得照他辦。若干天之後，自去察看時，宫女們果然個個神采煥發了，却另有許多瘦得不像人樣的男人，拜伏在地上。皇帝吃了一驚。問這是什麽呢？宫女們就囁嚅的答道：是藥渣。</p>
<p>照前幾天報上的情形看起來，吳先生彷彿就如藥渣一樣，也許連狗子都要加以踐蹈了。然而他是聰明的，又很恬淡，决不至於不顧自己，給人家熬盡了汗水。不過因爲九一八以後，情形已經不同，要有一種新藥出賣是眞的，對於他的冷笑，其實也就是新藥的作用。</p>
<p>這種新藥的性味，是要很激烈，而和平。譬之文章，則須先講烈十的殉國，再叙美人的殉情；一面贊希特勒的組閣，一面頌蘇聯的成功；軍歌唱後，來了戀歌；道德談完，就講妓院；因國恥日而悲楊柳，逢五一節而憶薔薇；攻擊主人的敵手，也似乎不滿於自己的主人……總而言之，先　新用的是單方，此後出賣的却是複藥了。</p>
<p>複藥雖然好像萬應，但也常無一效的，醫不好病，卽毒不死人。不過對於誤服這藥的病人，却能夠使他不再尋求良藥，拖重了病症而至於胡塗的死亡。</p>
<h3 id="c8">「南」與「北」 <a href="#c8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>女人傳君屢稱道顧亭林語：「北人飽食終日，無所用心；南人羣居終日，言不及義。」謂爲切中時弊。</p>
<p>人體有瘦子胖子之分，我就屬於瘦子的一個。一到了夏天，晚間的苦難相逼而來：蚊子在耳邊嗡，臭蟲在頸上爬，蚤子在被窩裏跳，我們這些瘦子朋友，大有不可一日居之勢。我曾經在南京下關一個大旅社的小房間裏，和蚊子臭蟲戰鬭到天明，結果還是我告饒，自甘退避三舍。胖子朋友大不以我的寢不安枕爲然，儘管臭蟲在他的面上爬，他還說我神經過敏，一天下本無事，庸人自摵之！」不若他的鼾聲高起，「萬物並育而不相害一最爲穩妥。</p>
<p>瘦子碰到瘦子，花樣討論得很多：「蚊香」，「避蚊香水」，「飛力脫」，「臭蟲藥粉」，「樟腦油」，「碘酒」……之類，各本經騐提供大家參考；無奈到了晚上，敵人再來侵襲，我們仪舊沒有壕溝可守；一處癢，一處痛，抓了這邊，癢了那邊，還是自甘告饒，訂城下之盟。飛鳥之中，有一種呌作號寒蟲的，晚間宿在枝上，風吹雨打，實在難當；於是各自飛在空中，衣哀地呌道；「明天作窠！明天作窠！」彷彿是很决心似的。到了第二天，全沒有那麽一回事；等黄昏到來，再棲宿在枝上，再「明天作窠，明天作窼」哀號一次。瘦子的黄昏哲學，大概是號寒蟲這一派傳下來的。</p>
<p>瘦子嘲笑胖子神經麻木，胖子嘲笑瘦子神經過敏，總算喂飽了蚊子臭蟲跳蚤，個個肥頭胖腿，在那里擱起脚來大得意。「無所用心」的若和「言不及義」的鬭嘴，王壬秋必在旁邊大笑道：「民猶是也，國猶是也，何分南北？」</p>
<p>曰：「開會」，「發宣言」乾着急的，平津之間大有其人：「跳跳舞」「打打麻將」的，滬寗靑年何多讓焉；顧亭林之論南北亦未盡然。余答之曰；南方也有胖子，北方也有瘦子，蚊子臭蟲則無間於南北也。因作「南」，「北」合論。</p>
<h3 id="c9">讀了田漢的戲曲 <a href="#c9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>— 硃</p>
<p>田漢戲曲别集第一册「暴風雨中的七個女性，」上海湖風書局出版，内收：年夜飯，梅南，　　，掃射，暴風雨中七個女性，共五篇。亂鐘以下三篇都以「反日鬥爭」爲題材，「亂鐘」的背景是九一八瀋陽事變，「掃射」的背景是九一九長春失守，「暴風雨中」的背景則爲一二八上海戰事的前夜。這三篇戲曲都曾屢次排演，給了人深刻的印象。</p>
<p>「年夜飯」寫失業的恐慌怎樣破碎了小布爾喬亞職業者的美滿生活的幻想，同時却也使他走上了革命的路。「梅雨」寫失業和高利貸壓迫下的勞動者家庭。我認爲這一篇最好。</p>
<p>因爲在「梅雨」中，不但攻擊工廠主的慘酷剥削，工人在設備不完全的工塲送了命或是弄成殘廢以至失業，不但暴露了高利貸者以及所謂二房東怎樣吮吸工人的血汗，並且還把把意識落後的老工人和他的意識進步的妻女作一對照，並氓意識而以詐嚇綁票爲復仇手段的錯誤。這是很複雜的題材。田漢先生驅使這複雜的題材，又簡潔，又明快！最後，他借老工人的自殺來宣告了落後意識的沒有出路，借詐嚇者的被捕來指出了流氓意識的不是路，而以羣衆罷工鬥爭的勝利爲結束：「你瞧！不是天晴了麽？」用這樣雙關的熱情的一句閉了幕！</p>
<p>如果說田漢田戲曲有一個缺點是抽象的敎訓太多，那麽，這篇「梅雨」是沒有這缺點的！</p>
<p>再者，田漢的戲曲即使帶點濃重的浪漫諦克色彩，可是他那生氣虎虎的熱情常使人異常感動。例如「年夜飯，」「亂鐘，」和「掃射。」然而給我以最大的喜悅的，還是「梅雨。」因爲在此劇中，除了「革命的浪漫主義」而外，還相當的配合著「社會主義的寫實主義」。</p>
<h3 id="c10">辛哥兒 <a href="#c10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>— 彭雪珍</p>
<p>辛哥兒的媽這天使勁地瞪了她這唯一的兒子一眼。</p>
<p>只爲了她快要離廠轉回鄕下時，兒子說：「媽，我跟你回去！她就這麽像是生氣了的樣子瞪了他一眼。</p>
<p>全是大伯聳恿的：「辛哥兒過年可就十四歲了，種田旣吃不飽，爲什麽不上城裏去呢，就像我當脚夫，也沒挨識。」母親指望着的只有辛哥兒一個人。她想讓他學個手藝好呌他下的丈夫放心。說合好了。大伯託人在城裏一家營造　裏　辛哥　找了個徒弟的位置。　媽的忍着涙替兒子預備舖蓋。</p>
<p>廠主是個戴玳瑁邊眼鏡的滿論紅光的大胖子，那威嚴使鄕下女人拌擻子好久還沒有和他說話的勇氣。</p>
<p>辛哥兒堵着嘴聽着媽的吩咐呌了聲師傳。</p>
<p>「當徒弟第一要聽人使喚。可不能像在田裏那麽自在。吃飯不容易，記好！如不聽話…一辛哥兒疑惑這就是鄕下人說着嚇孩子的三頭六臂的魔鬼在說話。　　「是的，師傳，這孩子頭一回離家，沒管敎，有不是的地方，就…」辛哥兒不知奴要說「就打」呢，還是别的。但小心眼兒裏知道：媽是疼兒子的。</p>
<p>廠主不再說話，揮着手呌她回去。就在這當兒，辛哥兒凑到母親跟前說了那句使奴瞪眼的話。</p>
<p>辛哥兒茫然地瞅着廠主的吃人的臉，撒了緊握着媽的手，母親像是滿眼噙着涙。</p>
<p>耕牛似的，辛哥兒被牽着到了正在興工的洋房前，放下肩上的比自己個兒大三倍的木頭，肩膀上酸酸的，在街上幾次險些兒要抛下來。緊接着又挑磗或牛屎似的爛泥。有人敎他怎樣杭育杭育的喊，怎樣乖覺，息樣伺候師傳……</p>
<p>辛哥兒肩上壓着重載，小心地地動着，怕驚擾了地鼠似的。滿身流着臭汗。晚上，隨着幾個夥伴在一間屋子裏打開家裏帶來的透露出太陽味兒的舖蓋。辛哥兒伏在那上面低低地哭了，怕被人知道。</p>
<p>早上醒來，肚子餓得要命，一樣的白米飯，一樣的一　鹹菜，年　　心裏不自在，吃了半碗就擱下了。他撫摩着肩胛上昨天被大木頭　　了的地方　心頭愈加痛苦。</p>
<p>可是。幹麽媽要把我一個人丢在這裏呢？幹　奴要那麽凶狠地瞪我一眼呢，當我要跟她回家的時候？」</p>
<h3 id="c11">「逼山」 <a href="#c11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>— 李</p>
<p>時局雖然不太平，穀價雖然日益低落，農村窮困難然日甚一日，然而鬥牛的塲會還是照舊舉行了。金華的鬥牛風俗怕是别處所沒有的吧？</p>
<p>「逼山」這條有名的牛中之「武聖」一，又在這邊出風頭。吃的是桂圓酒，白糖湯，白米粥，麥粉羹一類東西；黄豆兒成担供奉牠，還怕牠不要哩。每逢初三十三廿三，「逼山」被十六個人簇擁着，背上「令旗」，頭上「題名牌坊」，揮身紅花大呢，的大鑼在前面開道。牛親家牛舅舅提着禮籃隨在後面，那種威武實在不減於前淸縣太爺下鄕。</p>
<p>據說「逼山」是附近八縣的無敵大將軍，以能連撞名，别的牛遇到牠這股連續逼撞的勁兒，莫不大敗奔逃，好像山嶽都會被牠逼倒似的。故名「逼山」。</p>
<p>大凡善鬥的牛，必在養得肥肥胖胖的，平時在人前雍雍穆穆，舉止和平。但一見同類，便威風勃發，凸出眼珠，氣呼呼的拚命苦鬥，不鬥到精疲力竭，滿身血跡，不肯干休。一旦敗了，便當塲被人殺了賣肉，决不抵抗。</p>
<p>逼山就是這樣的一條牛，但雖說是牛，其實不是和某一種人恰恰一樣嗎？</p>
<h3 id="c12">紅蘿蔔鬚 <a href="#c12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>— JULESRENARD作林取譯</p>
<p>雷辟克這天早晨剛由巴黎回來。他打開箱子，拿出幾樣禮物給人哥斐利克斯和姐兒愛勒　丁。這是幾樣很漂亮的禮物，恰恰是他們想了一個通晚的那幾樣（這多麽奇怪！）。隨後，雷辟克把兩手放在背後，很狡猾地瞧着紅蘿蔔鬚說道：</p>
<p>「你呢，你喜歡什麽？你喜歡一隻喇叭呢，還是一把手槍？」</p>
<p>實際，我們與其說紅蘿蔔鬚是一個勇敢的孩子。在喇叭和手槍兩樣東西裏面，他是喜歡喇叭的，這原因是喇叭不會從手裏放射什麽出去。可是他常常聽見别人說像他這樣大的孩子，嚴格說來，祗能玩玩兵器，指揮刀和其他戰具的。到了他這樣年齡，便應當聞聞火藥氣味並毁滅一些東西了。他的父親是很了解自己的孩子的；他一定帶來了他所需要的東西。</p>
<p>「我喜歡手槍」。他大膽地說，以爲自己一定猜中了。</p>
<p>他甚至更進一步補說着：</p>
<p>「現在再用不着把它藏起來啦：我已經瞧見了！」</p>
<p>「啊！雷辟克狼狽地說，「你喜歡手槍！那麽你完全改變了嗎？」</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚連忙改口說：</p>
<p>「沒有。算了罷？爷爷，我剛才說得頑的呢。請你放心罷，我是最不喜歡手槍的。快點把我的喇叭給我罷，我好津津有味地吹給你看。」</p>
<p>但雷辟克家的說：</p>
<p>「那麽你爲什麽扯謊呢？爲着使你的父親難過嗎，是不是？你旣然喜歡喇叭，你便不應當說喜歡手槍；並且你旣然什麽都不曾看見，你更不應當說你看見了手槍。所以，爲着使你下次不再說謊起見，你旣得不到手槍，也得不到喇叭。你瞧罷，這喇叭上有三個紅色絨球和一面附着金流蘇的旗幟呢。你看夠了罷。現在，你到廚房裏去看看我做到了沒有；滚，快滚，去把你自己的手指當喇叭吹罷。」</p>
<p>在大櫃的頂上一格，在一堆白色布單上面，紅蘿蔔鬚的喇叭纏着一隻紅色絨球和一面附着金流蘇的旗幟，在等待人家去吹宅，它不到，看不見，悄悄的，宅在那兒好像永沒有出頭的希望似的。</p>

<h3 id="c13">「五七國恥」與國恥的將來 <a href="#c13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>— 樸</p>
<p>讀者諸君··大家是沒有不知道今日爲十八年前（民國四年）日本政府致最後通牒於我國政府，限五月九日下午六時以前，對所提出的二十一條件，作滿意答覆的一天　那時候袁世凱因正在積極籌備做皇帝的緣故，竟不顧國家的存亡，於五月九日下午一時，由外交總長陸徴祥，次長曹汝霖赴日本公使署，面遞承認書，接受賣國的要求，從此，「五七」與「五九」這兩天，遂成中華民國歷史上遭受威逼與蒙羞屈伏的國恥日了</p>
<p>我們知道「五七」事件所給予國人的敎訓很大。自「五七」而後，在整個的政治方面，雖仍不外乎新舊軍閥官僚的前仆後繼，沒有什麽顯著的進步可言，但在羣衆思想的啓發與民族精神的興奮方面，則發生了一個很大很大的影響。第一，袁世凱因爲要做皇帝，就不惜簽賣國的條件，以致激動全國的公憤而失敗，使數千年來的封建思想受一根本的打擊，以後的軍閥官僚，至少在名義上，再不敢有此種企圖的意試，而對於外交上有喪國權的舉動，也不敢隨便簽諾了。第二，「五四」運動就是「五七」事件的直接産物。靑年羣衆思想的爆發，文學革命的呼聲不旋踵而普遍全國，民族革命思想的確立，勞苦大衆的自覺，因而造成民十五年國民革命軍北伐的成功。這都是「五七」事件所影響下的結果。我們若根。古人所說的「國無敵國外患國恒亡」的那句老話來看，那麽「五七」事件之有這於此古老民族復興運動的關係，實不能說不是重要的了。</p>
<p>但是自從「九一八」瀋陽事變後，繼之以「一二八」上海的戰事及今年熟河的陷落，直到目前灤東的敵軍雖自動退去，但多倫則又告失守，而國内軍政黨領袖意見分岐的傳說，仍然是紛至沓來，無組織的民衆固不必說了，就是執最高政權的人對於安内攘外的整個計劃也只有理想，殊少見諸實行的可能。在這種内亂戡定無期，外侮將有加無已的局面下來紀念「五七」，則又不能不使我們深深的感覺得「五七」事件所給予國人的剌激與影響，現在已入了消失衰微的境界了。</p>
<p>今後的國恥紀念日，必將愈來愈多，我們相信帝國主義的反動勢力將要繼繼增加，而中國則將爲這反動鬥爭的主要戰地··我們也相信今後國内的執政權者，倘若他們是要利用友邦的關係來維持自己的地位，則他們的反動手段也要與他們的友邦上下其手，打成一片的來壓迫一切他們所認爲是反革命或反動的一班民衆，到那時候，我想「五七」這個日子至少會沒有人去注意他，因爲比牠更大的「國恥」太多了。</p>
<p>但是又有什麽挽救的方策呢？有的，要等到全國民衆被壓迫到相當時期，施壓迫者到精疲力盡的時候，中國民族復興的日子就快到了。現在我們惟有竭力之所能及者，來做培養民族精神，喚醒與組織大多數國人的一類打基礎的準備工作。</p>

<h3 id="c14">一個眞理的發現 <a href="#c14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>— 前矛</p>
<p>失業者</p>
<p>在現在社會制度未變革前，無大人物作後盾的靑年是永不能找到適當的職業的。他所找到的可以總括的說是被榨取的職位。假如他反抗，他只有挨餓，直至饑寒來迫他俯首就範　這是我近來從失業中發現的眞理。</p>
<p>我本來是xx藥行的一個月薪四十元的寫字員。我有母親，弟弟，和一個二十歲的妻。四個人靠這人靠這區區數十塊錢過活，我們的苦况可不問而知了。我初進那洋行時，我的工作是專門打賑單。但那洋大班看見我會做事，便呌我打信件，配貨，報關，翻譯中西文件和廣告，把一件一件的事情都加在我身上了　起初，我頗悅意，頗驕傲，滿懷着西人會大加我薪水的希望。「我的前途未可限量呢　」我自己想。可是一年希望一年，四個年頭過去了，我的工錢仍舊沒</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>有加！我急殺了·於是寫信去要求。回信說得很客氣，說行裏沒有賺錢，不過他丨大班可以爲我寫信去問一問在美國的總行。接了這信，我又開始懷着半信半疑的驚喜的希望了。然而半年過去丁，大班不獨沒有增加我的薪金，而且連外國怎麽的回音，一字也沒有提起過。反之，一位穿得像娼婦，臉兒怎麽也塗不白的土耳其猶太女速記員，却從二百五十元的薪水加到三百元了！那個早晨，我探得了這個事實，忿怒到幾乎把厚厚的帳簿擲在地上，戴上帽兒走了。霎時間辭職兩字在我腦海裏盤旋着了。回到家裏，妻特别客氣的服侍我。在喫飯時，我把我的事情詳細說了後，妻也立時爲我不平，說出「不幹！不幹！」的字了。她又說，剛纔看見我那難看的面色，以爲我因了什麽事在限她呢。可是，在晚上睡在牀上時，妻却低聲的，惋惜的在枕畔勸我耐着性子，待有好機會才發威風。「你瘋了嗎？」我反駁了，「我若再幹下去，我會嘔出血來了！我是奴隸，任人宰割的嗎？」隔了數天，我驚悸地，傲然地向那洋人提出辭職了。</p>
<p>在家裏閒坐了一月，天天看着愁眉的妻，和聽着她埋怨的話，我終於在報上看到ＸＸ商學院招請一位打字員的廣告了。那天，我就立刻往友人家用他的打字機打了一封英文求職信寄去。</p>
<p>第三天接到回信了。信裏呌我星期六下午三時去考。妻和我都喜歡到了不得。</p>
<p>從三十個男性，四個女性中，我和另外兩位男性考取了。然而學校方面只要錄用一人，他們呌我們三人在星期一日去復試，以定最後去取。</p>
<p>我喜孜孜地回家，妻聽到了這個消息也鼓勵着我。在星期日，我到友人家裏拚命練習打字。結果，那天我以十分鐘打了一百二十字以上考得了第一名。立刻一位校役傳我到院長室去了。</p>
<p>院長是個短小的圓眼睛的人，穿着黑絨獺皮領大衣，坐在近門的寫字檯前的椅上。他對面坐首一個西服靑年，寫字檯旁也坐着一個穿布棉袍的靑年，他們倆大概是秘書之類吧？我踏進了門，那穿棉袍的靑年呌我站在院長旁邊。於是他們三人像檢察官似的問我了。</p>
<p>「你是什麽名字？」「那裏人？」「在什麽地方做過事？」「爲什麽現在不做了？」「你自己不做是自己喫虧的。」「四十元薪水夠用麽？」「這兒夜裏也要工作的。」「爲什麽不能？」「假日也要工作的。」「這兒是要你個人搬來住的，爲了使你可以有充足的工作時間。」「不過飯費要從工錢上扣除的。」院長問了我許多的話，我一一回答了。但我聽見了不分晝夜工作沒有休息時間，我的一片驚喜之心整個的沉下去了！我說夜裏工作可以商量，星期日却不能答應。</p>
<p>「你夜裏有什麽事？」「星期日也有事情嗎？」「爲什麽假日不願意作事？」這是穿西裝少年問我的。他簡直把我當牛馬一般看待了。</p>
<p>末了，院長問那兩位先生還有什麽問話，他們都說可以了。最後院長對我說：「讓我們商妥後再通知你。你接到信，請把履歷詳細塡上，再找保人蓋圖章。請你等候三四天吧。」</p>
<p>這樣，我三四天的，一星期的，一個月的等待着，但那夢寐不忘的信終沒有來！有一次，我在路上碰見一位和我同去復試的靑年。他說，他以二十元的薪水，獲得那職位了！</p>

<h3 id="c15">紗廠减工工友生活應如何維持案 <a href="#c15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>— 討論者議員琪</p>
<p>上期本刋中李六妹女士所提出的「紗廠減工工友生活應如何維持案」，的確是個嚴重的問題。</p>
<p>日本帝國主義爲了國内經濟恐慌的加深，不得不想從反工人專政的國家丨蘇聯，及瓜分中國的戰爭中，去求資本主義的出路。同樣的，資本家爲要解决那無法解决的經濟恐慌，不能不把這重擔放在工人的肩上。這次減工的結果，一定是大大的再行降低工人已經比牛馬都不如的生活程度，更利害的施行「生産合理化」和開除大批工人而産生無數新的失業後備軍。在現在的中國，對於工人是沒有什麽保障的，所以，要使紗廠工友活下去，只有反對減工，反對減低工鈿。但這當然不是李女士一個人所能做到的，只有姊妹們大家齊心團結起來，用實際的行動來向資本家反抗，才能達到目的。在這一過程中，資本家一定會想到用種種方法來威嚇工友或破壞團結，但如果姊妹們大家都抱義氣，「有福同享，有苦同受，」則最後的成功一定是屬於工友們的。舉個例來說，譬如資方說要開除這次「鬧事」的爲首工人，大家就要抱定「要開除就大家全開除」的决心。</p>

<p>王現在覺得好些嗎？妻仍舊是這樣子。我想：已經有七八天沒到廠裏去做工了，恐怕那摩温要說話，等幾天病好些，就去做工罷。</p>
<p>王你等病好了，再去做工罷。那摩温問起來，隔壁的阿毛，總會同你說的。妻你看，我們三個人，工不做，飯要吃的，常言道：「坐吃山要空」，總要想個法子掙些錢進來纔好。</p>
<p>王是呀！你看這短命大，「連下了幾天的雨，沒有停過，不然的話，我的攤頭擺出去，多少總可以掙到幾個錢的。妻你不能怪天的，只能怪我們的命運不好，你很好的在電車公司裏做工，那知罷工被開除了。我雖則沒有開除，可是病了。問李麻子借了十塊皮球錢，做做小生意，還不到一個月，又下以幾天的雨，批來的貨倒有一半發霉了，把本錢慢慢的蝕光，這不是我們的命運不好嗎？</p>
<p>王你不提起印子錢，我倒忘掉了。現在巳有三點多鐘，李麻子怕要來了。</p>
<p>職工訓練</p>
<h3 id="c17">女店員在倫敦 <a href="#c17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>— 祝振華</p>
<p>女店員在倫敦是非常盛行的，在那裏是有着女店員學校，及女店員介紹所的設立。差不多任何商號都雇有女店員，而有的竟盡是女子。然而牠們對於雇用女店員，是考慮得很謹愼。她們都須受嚴格的考試和體格的檢查。面貌的美麗當然是最重要的，但口才和學問方面也非俱全不可。</p>
<p>大倫敦，有很多規模宏大的百貨公司對於女店員是很注意的。她們每星期須受訓練一次，每次指定多少人作爲假定的顧客，多少人作爲店員，練習售貨時應有的態度，及合理的問答。每一季，有一次游戲式的大訓練。其方法約分爲三種：</p>
<p>一·商品記憶丨這是先把所有的店員分爲兩組，由指導員指定一組的某人先發問：「某某商品置在那一部份裏面？」並由她隨意指定另一組的某人作回答。假使她回答不出，便作爲負。再由負者反問勝者：「某某商品置在那一部份裏面？」這樣輪流着發問。</p>
<p>二·櫉窗陳設丨這是先由指導員指定某人出爲陳設，其餘的圍列在櫉窗前，待其陳設竣後，由其餘的加以討論，是否美觀。如某人以爲否，即出爲陳設，並解釋不美觀的理由。</p>
<p>三·放賬練習丨先由一人寫一頁很難認的貨名，地名，及購貨人姓名。如誰能察出爲某某字樣，即爲勝，並由勝者再寫許多貨名等，給其餘的察閱而練習筆法。</p>
<p>此外，這些公司對於時裝問題，亦很注意。在公司方面，先由設計師，製就　　多種，陳置　窗中，並另令女店員，都分别穿着各種異樣時裝爲先導，而使一般女顧客特别注意，以促進　的鶯業。</p>
<p>當顧客　門的時候，　　他需要買某種商品時，女店員是要立刻　和的　，笑，很親熱的給他丨也就是替公司丨服務。這是當女店員的所必具的條件。</p>

<h3 id="c21">好萊塢武俠明星　喬治勃倫脫少年時的冒險性（上） <a href="#c21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>— 遜南</p>
<p>喬治勃倫脫自已不大同人講的。很少人知道他在十年前，是愛爾蘭獨立運動中的一個健者，他曾不顧生命地從事於獨立黨的秘密工作。他作此秘密工作，雖前後不過一年餘，但前前後後作他的工作的，平均的年歲是六個星期。爲什麽呢？因爲英國當局對於愛爾蘭的獨立黨，取禘極嚴，黨人一經逮捕，立卽槍斃，毫不寛假。卽如現在愛爾蘭自由邦的總統凡勒拉氏，亦曾被逮捕數次，而所以未經槍斃的原因，係因爲他是生長在美國而有美國國藉的，所以英國爲了避免美國的干涉始終沒有拿他槍斃。喬治勃倫脫能担任獨立黨秘密工作至一年之久，亦可見他有勝人的胆略了。但喬治自已是從來不和人提起這事的，他以爲這並不算怎麽一回事。</p>
<p>我們現在先將喬治勃倫脫幼年的事情叙一叙。喬治在十一歲的時候，已是父母俱亡的孤兒了。他有一位姊姊和一位住在纽約的姑母。這二人就是他的近親了。不久他姊姊：就帶了他離别了愛爾蘭祖國，去到美國的紐約，去投奔他們的姑母。喬治勃倫脫在紐約進了學校，因爲他年幼，所以不久他就遺失了愛爾蘭故鄕的口音，而換了一口美國的談吐了。這個就是他以後從事於愛爾蘭獨立運動最大得力之處；因爲英國的警察偵探受了他的欺騙，當他是眞正的美國人了。</p>
<p>喬治生長得極快。他十四歲的時候，已經身材高大，如同二十歲的人。到了十八歲，人家以爲他是二十五歲了，他身體的高度已經超過了六尺。他在十八歲的時候，在紐約中學畢了業，就回愛爾蘭都城杜柏林去進大學。他在船中遇見了一位年輕的愛爾蘭敎士，他是熱心獨立運動的一分子。喬治和他談話之間，受了這位敎士的感動，亦就變了獨立運動的一個信徒。但是因爲這位敎士的介紹，喬治勃倫脫對於戲劇開始感覺到無窮的興趣。後來他在杜柏林大學裏，因爲他革命熱忱的流露，而與一位英國敎授，公然發生了衝突。幸虧他事先已經布置好，和一家戲館訂了合同。所以他就藉口於從事戲劇生活而退了學。他现校不久，即加入了獨立黨，做積極的工作，那時他還沒有滿十九歲。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c22">評「春江花月夜」 <a href="#c22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>— 燕南</p>
<p>全劇非常興奮</p>
<p>超脫英國作風</p>
<p>昨天南京戲院在兩點半鐘就掛出了客滿牌子，僥倖的我，得了一個座位，看完了「春江花月夜」ＴＥＬＬＭＥＴＯＮＩＧＨＴ，帶着滿意歸來。</p>
<p>在正劇以前，有一張烏發公司的純粹音樂片，長一千尺，全片自始至終是一個五十人大集合的音樂隊的奏樂，抑揚頓挫，異常悅耳。</p>
<p>正劇演出時，就是「今夜告訴我」的歌聲，不同凡響，使人呌絶。由一個電台放音，轉寫到聽無線電的許多人，爲歌聲沉醉「賊入内室而不知。非但巧妙活潑，令人解頣，而且一開始已經把劇中主角的聲價身份，明顯的介紹給觀衆，入人至深。導演能力，也在影片的第一幕，就呌人深深欽佩了。牠的本事是這樣的：</p>
<p>一個歌王，久爲全歐人士所傾慕，他的女經理，呌他到各處公演，他深厭女經理的纏擾不休，所以中途逃去。他遇見了一個善於辭令的巨騙，非常投機，歌王任他作秘書。到了某市，市長以及記者市民等都一一來訪，歌王不勝其煩，呌那新秘書假充自己，相與周旋。他却獨身出遊，邂逅一位女郎，互相愛慕，詎料女郎就是市長的小姐。那時市長正在捕拿那個巨騙，反把眞歌王擒去，他不得巳了，才用歌唱來證明，被釋以後，也只好登台了。女經理追踪而來，歌王用計鎖之内室，自己跑出來，和市長小姐結婚了。</p>
<p>至於市長辦公室中，種種的不合情理，我却不去批評了，因爲歌唱喜劇，或滑稽幽默作品，寳在不能用現實去抹煞一切藝術精華的，何况牠多份是有冷雋諷剌的意味？而且挿入歌曲，也毫不　　。　演的　可以說是　分　明，分幕時的轉筆，更是出神入化，光線平當，而攝影極好，攝法的新頴，眞可說是「目不暇接，美不勝收」。發音也淸楚得很，音樂又符合了動作的節奏。每一幕的連續或突轉，人物地位的配置，先聞聲後見面，都有巧妙的思想，出人意外。</p>
<p>演員表上的七個角色，各有可取之處，當然主角ＴＡＮＫＩＥＰＵＲＡ飾歌王最好。市長小姐ＭＡＧＤＡＳＣＨＮＣＩＤＥＲ表演很不錯，但是好角色太多，所以見不出她的特長來。巨騙ＳＯＮＮＩＥＨＡＬＥ確是妙人，呌人愉快。市長ＥＤＭＵＮＤＧＷＥＮＮ和侍者ＡＵＢＲＥＹＭＡＴＨＥＲ供給笑料最多，冷雋而幽默。市長夫人ＡＴＨＥＮＯＳＥＹＬＥＲ和女經理ＢＥＴＴＹＣＨＥＳＴＥＲ也異曲同工，信足生色，唱的也好。</p>
<p>英國片子從ＧＯＯＤＮＩＧＨＴＶＥＩＮＮＥ問世以後，已經升高了不少地位，但是這一張高蒙公司的出品公演以後，英國影片界更足以自豪了。「璇宫豔史」也　視此有遜色吧？</p>
<h3 id="c23">評「孤軍」 <a href="#c23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>劇情牽强淺溥</p>
<p>導演表穉演幼</p>
<p>以「國府要人題字褒奬」和「電影明星爲藝術而犧牲」爲號召的孤軍，昨天在我們熱烈的期望之中開映了。然而不幸實得其反，這是一部令人過於失望的片子。</p>
<p>誰都應該承認，在目前東北四省巳經完全失去的情勢中，只有發動和加緊眞正抗日反帝的革命民族戰爭，才是我們中國唯一的出路。關於這一點，在藝術的一切部門中，當然是必須盡量的反映，進一步的成爲完成這一偉大的工作之主要的鐡練之一環。然而在這種情形之下而産生的「孤軍」却沒有担當起他的任務，正相反。它却以狹隘的國家觀念去解釋這一偉大的民族戰爭。完全忽視了反帝的重要意義。我們看罷，「孤軍」中所表現出來的是毫無組織毫無計劃的孤軍在　目地犧牲，幼稚的作戰　我們想：假如眞的像這樣去動員羣衆抗日，那末正是促進民族的滅亡。至於劇中還穿挿着一大半無聊的愛情，以及所謂效法「岳王爺的精忠報國」的庸俗可笑，當然也是本片弱點的暴露。假如我們一定要其中找着一些比較可取的地方，那便是援軍的見死不救，到是能夠使我們回想起「一二八」單爭的可恥的情况。</p>
<p>劇情的淺薄不通，當然也是本片失敗的主要點。假如要摘要的指出來，便是：（一）劇中根本就沒有「第一現代木蘭」（演員表上寫着那已「爲藝術而犧牲」的楊柳靑，大概是表示紀念不忘之意）出現，而偏偏在趙人傑口却說在第一第二現代木蘭之外，還有第一現代木蘭。（二）趙人傑的母親突然無病而終。（三）一個軍官說：「沒有了子彈便用手溜彈，沒有了手溜彈便上剌刀，剌刀斷了便用槍柄，槍柄也斷了便用拳頭」；本來這都是悲壯的言詞，但在劇情却十分可笑。（事實上昨天便有多人大笑不止。）其餘當然還有許多，但不必枚舉。</p>
<p>如上所述的各點，自然是編劇的不通，但也是導演的幼稚無能。戰爭的塲面是假的，當然在資本拮据的實情之下我們可以原諒，至於剪接上糊塗混亂，不懂得運用ＭＯＮＴＥＧＥ的方法，却是大的缺憾。鏡頭亦不靈活，但關於取景到有極少數的差强人意。</p>
<p>關於表演只有主角閔德張比較的生動，但滿臉的油光（假如偶然用之却能帮助表情。）令人久見生厭。其他均惡劣而不足道。</p>
<p>攝影的技巧，除了少數的畫面過於稜模之外，總算是本片的優點。字幕是不勝庸俗。</p>
<p>然而這些都還不是我們必須指摘的地方，主要的是片中的意義錯誤。</p>

<p>曼麗第一次遇見約翰卡頓，是在她父親的公事房裏。她父親威廉麥羅是一個大船主；是一個私人銀行家；在那新英格蘭的一村，他係首富。約翰卡頓不過是他一個書記，一個毫不重要的人物。而威廉麥羅却是一位重要的人物。英國的赫雷爵主要娶他的女兒，帶她回英國去。</p>
<p>曼麗如花朶般美麗的臉上忽然添上一陣紅雲。他眉心一縐，眼睛回到她寫的那封信，她連忙地又寫了幾句，然後簽上她的芳名；下面還加了一排的「愛克斯」（ＫＩＳＳＥＳ的符號）；她又將那信凑上她的櫻唇，很命地吻了幾下。親愛的約翰！她重要倦眼惺忪地望著那花園，在那裏每天夜晚他一定來偷着和她銷磨一刻的歡娱。</p>
<p>她並沒有嫁給赫雷爵主的意思。她老早就將這意見禀明她的父母了，她說她並不愛他。但是她的意思怎樣，是沒有什麽重要關係的。在十九世紀中　的新英格蘭，女兒們第一要順從父母，很少能自由作主的。麥羅先生與麥羅夫人已同意於將曼麗嫁給赫雷爵主了。他們認這是再好沒有的配合。</p>
<p>曼麗將信疊好了，封了起來，交給她親信的蘇笙姨母。她姨母拿了這信，偷偷裏跑到銀行裏，託給另外一位約翰的同事，然後再轉交約翰。這是極秘密的事情，她父親一些不知道的。曼麗在家裏算計着約翰接得那封信的時光，如同親眼看見約翰心花怒放的情形似的。她　　　　　　　（未完）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Imminent and Acute Conflict Between Japan and the Soviet Union <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The issue of the impounded vehicles on the Chinese Eastern Railway has become the focal point of the dispute between the Soviet Union and its puppet state. The puppet state has demanded that the Soviet Union return the vehicles by May 10th, leaving only three days. On the Soviet side, there has been no concrete indication of returning the vehicles, while the puppet regime has threatened to take decisive action, including blockading Suifenhe by force, disregarding everything. Relying on Japan's strength to seize the Chinese Eastern Railway, they are also spreading rumors that Japan will use "financial power" to buy it out, making the Soviet Union feel besieged militarily and economically. Coupled with the joint actions of various capitalist countries, it feels that even greater difficulties are arising in international relations. Meanwhile, the Japanese troops invading Northeast China entered Soviet territory via Suifenhe on April 18th. Ostensibly, this "Japanese troop entry into Soviet territory" was an excuse because Soviet police were preventing the Japanese army from suppressing bandits. However, Japanese foreign affairs authorities claim that there is no malicious intent to invade Soviet territory and that the Chinese Eastern Railway issue is a matter between the Soviet Union and "Manchukuo," with which Japan has no direct relationship. We are well aware that the so-called "Manchukuo" was purely a puppet of Japanese militarism in the past and has now become its slave. This is known to all countries in the world. The Soviet Union and the two provinces of Jilin and Heilongjiang are close neighbors, and their observations should be more accurate than those of other countries. Furthermore, the Chinese Eastern Railway runs across northern Manchuria, and they must have a thorough understanding of all the conspiracies and intrigues of Japanese imperialism. Therefore, General Belov, commander of the Soviet Far East Army, publicly stated in Khabarovsk on May Day, "This year, we live in a tense international situation, the tension of which is unprecedented. At any time, we must use an iron fist to deal with those who infringe upon Soviet territory and defend the victories of the revolution." General Belov is truly a proponent of war against Japan. However, in a disciplined Soviet Union, it would not deliberately make dangerous statements at a time of tension in Japanese-Soviet relations. Tokyo may strongly defend itself and pose as a third party, but what about the fact that Japanese soldiers are all over the three northeastern provinces and the power of the commander of the Kwantung Army dominates everything in the Northeast?</p>
<p>At the beginning of the September 18th Incident, the Japanese army sought to gain the understanding of the great powers by suppressing the Red scare and blockading the Soviet Union. It also used this to restrain the Soviet Union and force it to take a defensive posture. Its so-called continental policy is primarily aimed at annexing "Manchuria and Mongolia." However, before the annexation policy can be implemented, it is only invading our country's land. Although various arguments are made, they are merely means to carry out this policy. It is willing to work with the great powers, whether it be Britain, the United States, or the Soviet Union, to achieve its continental policy. Its diplomacy towards the Soviet Union is particularly tortuous and circuitous, as it carefully observes that the Soviet Union is focusing all its efforts on the "Five-Year Plan" and will not be distracted by the incident in Northeast China. By the time it had succeeded in Liaoning and Jilin and the puppet regime appeared, Japan's momentum of sweeping through the three northeastern provinces had already taken shape, and the Chinese Eastern Railway became a thorn in its side. Therefore, with the issue of the impounded vehicles on the Chinese Eastern Railway, the Soviet Union insists on not returning them, and the puppet regime insists on threatening to blockade the border. Will the conflict between the Soviet Union and Japan lead to armed conflict through a Soviet-puppet conflict?</p>
<p>Judging from the current general situation, although the conflict between the Soviet Union and Japan is intensifying, the final settlement will inevitably involve a war. However, in terms of the actual situation, Japan still does not dare to start a war against the Soviet Union alone, as it would fall into a tragic situation. Although the Japanese army claims to be as good as anyone, its mechanized equipment is far behind that of other countries. The various tools of chemical warfare are even more inferior to those of others. The only weapon of three-dimensional warfare, the airplane, is almost beyond comparison with that of the Soviet Union. Moreover, the decisive factor in modern warfare lies not in the battlefield but in the strength of the national economy. The current global economic panic is deepening. The economic alliances led by major countries are becoming increasingly strong. Japan is threatened by the Soviet Union in the east and constrained by the British Empire's economic alliance in the west. According to the most recent survey published in 1930, its total national wealth is greater than in 1924, but the average individual wealth has decreased by 21 Japanese yen. Moreover, the current Japanese gold is only half of its par value, which shows the decline of its national strength. In addition, the economic relationship between Britain and Japan is not satisfactory, and the rifts between Japan and the United States are even deeper. Without international assistance, Japanese imperialists, no matter how arrogant, would not dare to challenge the Soviet Union lightly.</p>
<p>Conversely, the Soviet Union's national strength is growing steadily. Its industrial construction is no less than that of Japan, and its steel, oil, and coal, the three elements of war, surpass Japan. As for all military preparations, they have become more substantial since the implementation of the "Five-Year Plan." It is not difficult to win a solo war against Japan. However, in terms of ideology and actual interests, its enemy is not just Japan. Unless forced to the point of no return, it will never attempt war and destroy the foundation of its hard-won victories. Moreover, it knows that the confrontation between Japan and the United States cannot be eliminated, and the relationship between France and Germany and France and Italy is difficult to satisfy. The Soviet Union will quietly observe the turbulent changes in the Pacific and watch the struggles of European countries to slowly continue its own development and maintain its long-standing policy of peace.</p>
<p>Based on this observation of the Chinese Eastern Railway issue, neither Japan nor the Soviet Union is willing to challenge each other alone. It must wait for changes among other countries in the world. Although Japan is one of the key players in international changes, it is feared that its propaganda will outweigh the facts in any war against the Soviet Union before its economic relationship with Britain can be satisfactorily resolved.</p>

<p>League of Nations Plans an Incomplete</p>
<p>Statement of Non-Recognition of the Puppet Organization</p>
<p>Refuses the Puppet State's Accession to All International Conventions</p>
<p>Consuls Are Not Withdrawn and the Exchange of Currency and Drafts Is Not Prohibited</p>
<p>Postage Stamps Are Invalid and Decided by the Universal Postal Union</p>
<p>(Geneva) Today, the League of Nations Secretariat's Three-Person Subcommittee, chaired by Italian Representative Burotti, drafted a statement on the issue of non-recognition of "Manchukuo." It first described the treaties establishing various international alliances, such as postal, telegraph, telephone, wireless, public health, agriculture, railway, transportation, and communications organizations, especially emphasizing all the conventions established under the guidance of the League of Nations Labour Bureau. It then described the methods of joining such conventions and pointed out the steps that could be taken to prevent the "Manchukuo" government from joining the above conventions, especially emphasizing postal communications, stating that the issue of the invalidity of "Manchukuo" postage stamps is of the utmost importance, and this matter must be decided by each country in the Postal Union. Regarding the "Manchukuo" currency system, the statement said that the private sale of its currency cannot be prevented, and the exchange of "Manchukuo" currency drafts is also difficult to prohibit, because if such transactions are prohibited, "Manchukuo" merchants will inevitably use other currencies, such as the Japanese yen. The statement also said that financial prohibitions are difficult to implement, and financial inflows and outflows can also be done through Japan to avoid prohibitions. Therefore, if the prohibitions on "Manchukuo" exports are to be effective, the only way is to impose prohibitions on Japanese exports. The statement mentioned the concessions in Manchuria, saying that each country should warn its citizens of the danger of accepting "Manchukuo" concessions, because the governments of each country cannot undertake to protect those who enjoy concessions, nor can they guarantee that such concessions are valid in the eyes of the Chinese authorities. The statement mentioned passports, saying that since the League of Nations member states have undertaken not to recognize "Manchukuo" in fact or in law, the "Manchukuo" passport should naturally be considered invalid. The statement continued to mention consuls, saying that China is a country that does not require consular accreditation, so each country can send consuls to Manchuria and recognize Manchuria as a part of China temporarily outside the authority of the Chinese central government.

<p>League of Nations Japanese Branch</p>
<p>Changed to International Association</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese branch of the League of Nations must be cancelled due to Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations. It is reported that the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs will change it to an international association to continue its work, with the tasks of investigating international affairs and promoting international knowledge. It will be renamed and operated from next month. (China United Press dispatch of the 6th)</p>
<p>Araki Makes Another Mad Statement</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Minister of the Army Araki inspected the military industries of Osaka and Kobe, attended the inaugural ceremony of the National Defense Volunteer Association, and inspected the troops in the area. He left Tokyo Station westward at 9:00 p.m. last night with Lin, head of the Maintenance Bureau, and Ishii, a participant official. In the train, he told reporters that the Japanese Empire is currently encountering an extraordinary time, but it is impossible to determine the boundary of when the extraordinary time begins and ends. At least two or three years require the whole country to be united. There are currently various problems such as the League of Nations issue, the Manchuria issue, the China issue, and the economic conference. It is necessary to pay temporary attention to the movements of the Roosevelt government, but there is no need to make a fuss about the North China issue and the Russian-Manchurian issue. If the Chinese side consistently does not understand Japan's true intentions and plays insidious tricks, and the Russian side also plays cunning and hinders the development of "Manchukuo," then Japan will only have the word "severance." If we are overly sensitive to these small things, we cannot open up the extraordinary situation. The May 15th Incident will be decided by legal opinions after the investigation by the three ministries of the Army and Navy is completed. It is currently unclear what the charges are.

<p>(New York) As soon as the Chinese delegation arrives in Washington, economic issues will become the target of talks between China and the United States from Monday next week onwards. The Chinese delegation will explain the current state of the Chinese economy regarding the Manchuria issue and Japan's use of troops in North China. The U.S. government's views on the Manchuria and North China incidents will also be clearly explained to the Japanese representative, Viscount Ishii, when he arrives. (Havas dispatch of the 5th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Regarding the overseas telegram that Japanese representative, Viscount Ishii, will request an increase in the Japanese naval ratio when talking with President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull, U.S. Secretary of the Navy Swanson commented today that such a proposal may be opposed by the U.S. authorities, because the ratio stipulated in the London Treaty should be maintained. He does not see any reason for change, especially at a time when the United States has not yet built new ships to the extent permitted by the ratio. According to the current ratio, the ratio of Japan to Britain is 5.8 to 10.3, and the ratio of Japan to the United States is 5.8 to 10. Japan now wants the ratio to Britain to be 7.4 to 10 and the ratio to the United States to be 8.3 to 10. However, senior U.S. naval officers believe that since the United States is actually complying with the naval construction holiday and implementing a naval austerity plan unprecedented in history, all ratios must be kept as they are. It is also heard that the U.S. President will suggest not changing the naval ratio, but greatly reducing the naval forces of various countries, as a plan for international austerity and restoration of mutual trust. It is also heard that the U.S. President is willing to focus on discussing economic matters with Ishii. (Dispatch of the 5th, National News Agency)</p>

The British government is making great efforts to save the work of the arms reduction conference.

<p>Interests Are Protected as Much as Possible</p>
<p>Herriot Returns Triumphantly</p>
<p>(Paris) Former Prime Minister Herriot returned from the United States. The ship he was on, the Ile de France, has arrived at Le Havre. Foreign Minister Pengu and Minister of the Interior Xu Dang were waiting at Le Havre. Herriot declared to reporters who rushed to greet him that he had brought back a lot of news and had obtained very clear arguments. Roosevelt's gracious hospitality was particularly touching. Roosevelt handled various extremely difficult problems with an extremely keen mind. No one has contributed more to France than Roosevelt. This is what the French people should know. Herriot believed that the achievements that the general public could have hoped for from his trip had been obtained. He said, "The United States advocates a substantial reduction in armaments and a cessation of competition. It is also willing to participate in an organization that is greatly beneficial to international security by defining the aggressor country. It can be said to be a great step forward on the path to peace. During each conversation, Roosevelt gave me the opportunity to express my views without any scruples. I have protected French interests as much as possible." Herriot is scheduled to arrive in Paris at 0:40 a.m. (Havas dispatch of the 6th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The French representative to the Washington talks, Herriot, arrived at the Ministry of the Army with a yellow leather briefcase full of official documents.

<p>Regarding Financial Issues</p>
<p>The United States Sends a Note to the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs</p>
<p>(Washington) The State Department today declined to confirm or deny the Paris rumor that the United States had sent a note to the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding financial matters. It is generally believed that the United States has indeed sent a document, but given the complexity of the current financial situation, it is not announcing its contents.</p>
<p>Political and Economic Emphasis</p>
<p>Germany Supports Tariff Truce</p>
<p>(Washington) When German representative Schacht called on President Roosevelt today, he stated that Germany is willing to cooperate on the issue of tariff truce and tax reduction. (Reuters dispatch of the 5th)</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt and German representative Schacht had their first contact at lunch at the White House today. It is reported that Schacht declared that the purpose of his talk with Roosevelt was to focus on the political situation, and economic issues are not the main factors in the current world situation. The current situation of the great powers being divided into groups confronting each other must be eliminated as much as possible. Schacht will persuade President Roosevelt that Germany should restore its absolute equality with other countries in all aspects. Regarding economic issues, the main problem of stabilizing the currency should be solved before discussing the reduction of tariff barriers. The complete lack of a stable currency that can represent the value of goods and guarantee contract payments is the main reason for the paralysis of world trade. Regarding the tariff truce plan, Germany regards it as beneficial and a sign of goodwill and is very willing to support it.</p>
<p>Four-Power Cooperation Plan</p>
<p>Discussion between the U.S. and Italy</p>
<p>The Italian representative to the Rome-Washington talks, Minister of Finance Rinke, will stay in Washington for 24 more hours. This is considered a particularly important sign of the talks between the representatives of Italy and the United States. The messenger reported that the Washington side had discussed Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's four-power cooperation plan. President Roosevelt expressed his approval. Other newspapers did not comment on this matter or other international issues, but regarded economic events as the primary issue. (Havas dispatch of the 6th)</p>

<p>World Economic Conference</p>
<p>The Session May Be Extended to Six Months</p>
<p>Roosevelt Will Personally Go</p>
<p>But Not Participate in Substantive Discussions</p>
<p>(London) The World Economic Conference is scheduled to open in London on June 12. Opinions in political circles here vary on how long the session will last, ranging from two months to six months, and some even say it will be more than six months. It is also expected that there will be about 2,000 representatives and experts attending the conference. The opening public meeting will last for two weeks, although many valuable committee works will continue to be carried out. The formal conference will be adjourned for most of August and the entire month of September, because many representatives will have to go to Geneva to attend the League of Nations General Assembly at that time. Although this meeting will be held in London, the British government will not entertain the representatives because it is a League of Nations affair. It will only prepare the meeting place. (Reuters dispatch of the 5th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to the report from Ambassador Debuchi in the United States to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the U.S. representatives who will attend the London World Economic Conference have now been decided to be President Roosevelt, Chairman Pittman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Undersecretary of State Moley, and former Secretary of State Stimson. It is heard that the President will only attend the opening ceremony of the economic conference and does not intend to participate in substantive discussions.

<p>Chinese Eastern Railway Issue</p>
<p>The Puppet State Unreasonably Refutes Russia's Protest</p>
<p>Openly Attempts to Plunder Russian Rights</p>
<p>Chinese Staff of the Chinese Eastern Railway Will All Be Replaced by Japanese</p>
<p>The Number of Japanese Cavalry Approaching the Russian Border Increases to 5,000</p>
<p>Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs Formulates a Draft Plan for a Joint Committee</p>
<p>(Changchun) Li (Rebel) Shao-geng, supervisor of the Chinese Eastern Railway, yesterday handed over the following refutation to Vice-Chairman Koznitsev's protest note of April 28: (1) The claim that the Chinese Eastern Railway belongs to Soviet Russia is absolutely unacceptable from any point of view. (2) Soviet Russia has no legal relationship with the imperial Russian era, so the rights and interests of the Chinese Eastern Railway have been eliminated. According to the Beijing and Fengtian agreements of 1924, your relationship with the Chinese Eastern Railway is limited to the scope of the Chinese Eastern Railway jointly operated by commercial organizations, so there is no explicit statement in the agreement that the Chinese Eastern Railway belongs to Soviet Russia, nor is there any basis for inference. Your statement that Soviet Russia has special privileges and concessions regarding the Chinese Eastern Railway to China is completely groundless. On the contrary, the Chinese government has the special privileges and concessions of joint operation regarding the Chinese Eastern Railway to Soviet Russia. (3) In short, the issue of direct transportation of locomotives and freight cars, the so-called consistent adherence to the spirit of joint operation to seek a solution, is the requirement of "Manchukuo." The Chinese Eastern Railway has never belonged to Soviet Russia. It is specifically stated that it is a purely commercial organization jointly operated by Russia and "Manchuria" under the sovereignty of "Manchukuo." (4) The Soviet Russian side has always ignored the improper behavior of "Manchukuo" and I will resolutely reject it and repeatedly requested Soviet Russia to promptly reflect and return the locomotives and freight cars. (Electric dispatch of the 6th, Tsutenkaku)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to the Japanese military, Chief Morita and Section Chief Mori of the Puppet Railway Department went to Harbin for two official purposes: one is to submit a reply to Russia, and the other is to transfer Chinese employees. It is reported that the main positions of the Chinese Eastern Railway will be filled by Japanese hired by the South Manchuria Railway Company. At the same time, it will be renamed the North Manchuria Railway. Using force to plunder Russian rights and interests, the Russian side is testing Japan's true intentions by selling shares. Because Japan's finances are very difficult, there is no discussion of buying and selling. It has decided to take over by force. (China United News dispatch of the 6th)</p>
<p>(Harbin) The "Manchukuo" authorities have sent another note to Soviet Russia demanding the return of the impounded vehicles. This is seen as a prelude to direct action, saying that Soviet Russia's rights under the 1924 agreement must now be subject to the sovereignty of "Manchukuo." The number of Japanese cavalry in Hailar, the western section of the Chinese Eastern Railway, 100 miles east of the Soviet Russian border, is said to have increased to 5,000. (Reuters dispatch of the 6th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to reliable sources today, Soviet Russia has proposed selling the Chinese Eastern Railway to Japan for 300 million gold rubles. It is heard that Japanese military authorities advocate slowing down, believing that the road can be obtained at a cheaper price. However, the Japanese government has agreed to consider buying the road for 80 million Japanese yen. (Reuters dispatch of the 6th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign affairs authorities reported to the Cabinet Council today on the issue of establishing a joint Russian-Japanese-"Manchurian" three-nation committee. Various cabinet members raised questions and exchanged opinions. (Japan United News dispatch of the 6th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) In order to resolve various outstanding issues between the two countries, Russia and Japan have repeatedly negotiated in Moscow and Tokyo. When Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Arita met with Soviet Ambassador Yurenev in Japan on the 4th, Arita proposed organizing a joint Russian-Japanese-"Manchurian" committee to resolve various unresolved issues among the three parties. The content is roughly as follows: (1) Establish a joint three-nation committee to discuss methods to resolve all outstanding issues among the three countries. (2) This committee will meet in Tokyo. When necessary, subcommittee meetings will be held in Harbin, Manchuria, Blagoveshchensk, Suifenhe, and other places. (3) This committee will be composed of Vice Minister Arita, Director-General of the Bureau of Europe and America Narita, Russian Ambassador Yurenev, and (Puppet) Minister Ding Shiyuan. The subcommittee will be composed of the local Japanese and Russian consuls general and the "Manchukuo" representative. (4) The issues handled by the committee include the following: (A) Determining the Russian-"Manchurian" border in the Manchuria area. (B) Resolving the illegal intrusion by the Russian side in the Suifenhe area and all other disputes.</p>
<p>China-Japan Broadcasting War</p>
<p>Taipei Radio Station Will Broadcast in Chinese</p>
<p>Our Listeners Along the Coast Should Carefully Distinguish</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to the Tokyo Central Broadcasting Association, the Japanese news broadcast by the Nanjing Central Broadcasting Bureau is sufficient to disrupt the thinking of 600,000 listeners in Kyushu. Especially the new broadcasts in the past two or three days are no different from Japanese people in terms of Japanese language. The rhetoric is very good. Japanese people believe that the Japanese side's broadcast is firmly believed to be accurate, so it is necessary to find a way to confront it. The Chinese news is broadcast in Chinese on the 100-kilowatt radio station. When necessary, the Xiamen dialect will also be used. Although the power of the Taipei radio station is small, proximity to the Chinese coast is sufficient to compensate for the lack of power. The distance between Taipei and our important commercial ports is as follows: 167 miles to Fuzhou, 246 miles to Xiamen, 340 miles to Shantou, 583 miles to Guangdong, and 437 miles to Shanghai. It is heard that the Japanese side has decided to conduct a trial broadcast in Chinese from June 1, with a traitor Wang in charge of this work. (China United News dispatch of the 6th)</p>

<p>Cancellation of the Indian-Japanese Commercial Treaty</p>
<p>Japan Negotiates with India</p>
<p>The Indian Government Asks London for Instructions</p>
<p>Japan-India trade agreement cancellation issue and anti-dumping tax prevention issue have been discussed by Ambassador Matsudaira and British Foreign Secretary Simon. The British side stated that for the industrial policy of India, since it belongs to the autonomous authority of the Indian government, the London government has no jurisdiction. For the notification of the cancellation of the Japanese-Indian trade agreement, it is only handled according to the decision of the Indian government, so for the solution of this problem, it has been stated that the London government will never resign from the labor of transmitting the opinions of both Japan and India except for direct negotiations between Japan and India. Therefore, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs specially dispatched Consul General Miyake stationed in Calcutta to Shimla for preparatory negotiations. Consul General Miyake reported on the 6th that he met with the Indian government's trade chief on the 5th and requested direct negotiations. The trade chief said that although industrial policy is within the authority of the Indian government, diplomatic negotiations must be approved by the London government, so for your country's request, we will wait for a reply from the London government before replying.</p>

It is heard that Zhang will soon move into a villa outside the city. A Reuters reporter went to visit him, but Zhang was unwilling to talk about political issues, only asking him to be very fond of Italy, so he was willing to stay here for several months. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's daughter will meet Zhang with her father in the near future. Since leaving the country, Zhang's body has become stronger day by day. The former clothes are difficult to wear again, so he has bought many new clothes. Zhang receives telegrams from his subordinates from time to time, expressing their reluctance to part.

<p>Chen Gongbo and Others Discuss</p>
<p>Relief of Cotton and Silk Issues</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang Zhaoming and Chen Gongbo passed the government's plan to relieve the cotton and silk industries. The relief plan was divided into two methods: fundamental and symptomatic. Yesterday, after the Rural Revitalization Committee closed at noon, Shanghai revitalization committee members were invited to a meeting at the Ministry of Railways at 2:00 p.m. to discuss the two issues of relieving the cotton yarn and silk industries. Chen Gongbo, Guo Chuntao, Liu Yinpo, He Xihong, Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, Xu Xinliu, Chu Fucheng, Liu Hongsheng, Chen Bozhuang, and other 20 people attended. Chen Gongbo presided over the meeting and reported the government's methods and opinions for relieving the cotton industry. Then, Wang Xiaolai and Chu Fucheng stated the crisis and trends in the cotton yarn and silk industries. After discussion, it was decided that A. Regarding the relief of the cotton spinning industry, according to the fundamental and symptomatic methods passed by the Executive Yuan, since the fundamental methods are still being discussed by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry, 1. The government should discuss with national banks to provide low-interest loans of 20 million yuan to relieve the cotton spinning industry. The detailed methods of lending will also be decided by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry. 2. For promotion and transportation, the Shanghai cotton spinning industry will set up its own promotion and transportation headquarters. The name of the organization will be submitted to the competent authorities for approval after it is decided. 3. Regarding the relief of the silk industry, it was originally planned to issue another 6 million in bonds specifically for the relief of the silk industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. However, most argued that silk merchants in Sichuan, Shandong, Guangdong, and other provinces are now requesting relief. If it is specifically for the relief of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, it is close to bias, so there was no</p>
<p>Central Road, No. 25, Zhejiang Private Electricity United Association, held the fourth meeting of the fourth session of the Executive Supervisory Committee yesterday at the Atlantic Vegetable Society. More than a dozen representatives of electrical and telephone companies from Jinhua, Lanxi, Huzhou, Shaoxing, Jiaxing, Wenzhou, Jiashan, Changxing, and Wuzhen, including Jiang Lianseng, attended. Chairman Li Yanshi presided over the meeting according to etiquette. (A) Matters reported: (1) The Construction Committee ordered the implementation of the newly promulgated regulations for handling electricity theft. The association has issued a circular to all members to comply. (2) Member Zhouquan Puli Electric Light Company reported that the local water police owed electricity bills and requested assistance in clearing the debt to maintain capital. It was found that the water police district received monthly oil and fire subsidies from the Chamber of Commerce and should not deliberately accumulate debts under the pretext of arrears in wages. The association will send a letter to the Zhouquan Chamber of Commerce to allow the Puli Company to collect the electricity fees used by the water police district monthly under the oil and fire subsidy. (B) Matters for discussion: (1) Member Xiaoshan Yongan Electric Company reported that the Construction Committee arbitrarily changed the approved business area rights. Manager Wang came to appeal, requesting the association to provide assistance quickly. It was resolved to provide full assistance and notify the company to strengthen its own capabilities to facilitate response. (2) Member Jiaxing Zhongxing, Chongde, Tongli, Xieqiao, Xiechuan, Xiashi, Jieli, Jiashan, and other telephone companies reported that the Ministry of Communications' long-distance telephone subsidy for line crossing fees has always been five cents per call, but now it is proposed to reduce it to three cents, resulting in a significant loss. They successively sent letters to the association, requesting to forward them to the Ministry of Communications to withdraw the order and alleviate commercial difficulties. It was resolved to proceed accordingly. (3) Member Shipu Mingxing Electric Company reported that the Xiangshan County Government levied a protection group donation based on 22% of the registered capital of 30,000 yuan, resulting in an annual collection of 630 yuan, which they were unable to bear. Manager Ma repeatedly came to the association to request assistance. The association telegraphed the Construction Committee, Zhejiang Provincial Government, Construction Department, Civil Affairs Department, and Xiangshan County Government to find ways to stop it. It has now been reduced to 390 yuan. However, the company's annual income is less than 10,000 yuan, making it difficult to bear this exorbitant tax. Moreover, the capital scope of the Yaoyang Electric Light Company in the county urban area is similar to that of Mingxing, but it only pays 12 yuan in annual group donations. Such treatment is particularly unfair. It was resolved to continue to strive for it based on the Executive Yuan's circular. (4) How should the second investigation team proceed? It was resolved to go to Wenzhou, Taizhou, and Ningbo areas for investigation after June 15. (5) The Zhejiang Provincial Government and Qixin Syndicate signed an exclusive electrical operation agreement, which was submitted to the Construction Committee for correction. The Construction Committee replied that the submissions were noted and that the submitted sections contained misunderstandings. According to Article 5 of the agreement, the Zhejiang Provincial Government believes that the Hangzhou-Jiaxing and other four lines need to be laid as soon as possible, so it ordered the Qixin Syndicate to carry out this work. Subsequently, the syndicate will do its best to assist in the completion of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway, so when transferring the power plant, it granted this priority to the syndicate. Since the article stipulates that it does not hinder the business rights of other electrical operators, other electrical operators can rest assured. As for the exclusive operation rights mentioned in Article 6, any electrical enterprise has exclusive operation rights within its approved business area. Article 13 of the Regulations for Supervision of Private Public Utilities has clear provisions, and it cannot be said to infringe upon the rights of others. This agreement has been submitted to the National Government for approval and record. There is no need to discuss the request to transfer it to the Zhejiang Provincial Government and order the syndicate to amend the terms. Should the association continue to strive for this reply? It was resolved to continue to strive for it. (7) New members applying to join the association include Pingyang Zhonghua Company, Shengxian Sier Company, and Shangbai Company. It was resolved to hand them over to the standing committee for review.</p>

<p>News of the Acceptance Inspection of the Liu River Dredging Project</p>
<p>After the completion of the Liu River channel dredging project in the war zone by the Liu River Branch of the Jiangsu Provincial Labor Conscription and River Dredging Committee, the members of the branch committee requested the provincial government to send personnel for acceptance inspection. It is now learned that the Construction Department has sent Xu Decheng, the chief technician, Xia Yinzhi, the director of the engineering section, and Pan Mengqiao, the chief inspector, to conduct the inspection on the previous day (Thursday). Zhu Kaichou, the director of the Liu River Branch, and Cai Wangzhi, the deputy director, accompanied them to inspect the project section by section. On the first day, the Kunshan section was inspected first, and on the second day, the Taicang section was inspected. Yesterday, the Jiading and Baoshan sections continued to be inspected. It is also heard that the members of the provincial committee considered most of the project to be completed according to specifications. However, some difficult parts were not properly done, so the river workers were given two days to complete the repairs. It is also planned to hold a large-scale gathering on the morning of the 10th of this month at the East Dam, inviting the administrative officers of the three counties and local gentry and merchants to hold the opening dam ceremony. Invitation cards have been sent out.</p>
<p>China Child Welfare Association</p>
<p>Appeals for Northeastern Refugees</p>
<p>The China Child Welfare Association received a letter from Miyun, Hebei, yesterday, stating that refugees were gathering, numbering more than 4,000. Zhang Lianghe and Wang Youan, the chairman and vice-chairman of the county women and children relief association, were running around calling for help and organizing more than 12 reception areas. Men, women, old, and young were all included, especially the young boys and girls being carried in swaddling clothes, who were the most pitiful. Other areas, such as Luan County and Changli, which are close to the war zone, have been affected. According to letters from various parties, there are approximately 1,000 refugees in Luan County and more than 2,000 in Changli. Although local people have set up reception centers, the resources are scarce, and it is difficult to continue. Excluding the refugees in Qinhuangdao and Beidaihe, the total number of victims in Miyun, Luan, and Changli counties is no less than 8,000, with children accounting for approximately half and women also accounting for a significant number. If no relief measures are taken, these vulnerable people will either die from war or starvation and cold. In addition to sending letters to the Shanghai charitable organizations' joint relief association for Northeastern refugees to find ways to help, it is also hoped that people at home and abroad will show kindness, sympathize with the suffering of those who survived the disaster, and donate money and goods to save these orphans.</p>
<p>Dockworkers</p>
<p>Demand Implementation of the 20/80 System Again</p>
<p>Representatives Were Elected Yesterday to Petition the Party and Government</p>
<p>The issue of dockworkers in the city demanding the implementation of the 20/80 system was previously investigated by personnel sent by the Central Government to Shanghai, who promised to adopt the opinions and submit them to the Central Government for review. However, it has not yet been implemented. At 11:00 AM yesterday, the workers elected representatives, including Feng Xingcai and others, totaling more than 20 people, to take a petition to the municipal party headquarters. Zhou Lianze, the chief of the people's movement section, received them. The representatives stated that the issue of the 20/80 system has been in dispute for a long time and has not yet been realized. The workers' lives are very difficult. They requested that it be forwarded to the Central Government quickly and that the municipal government implement it as soon as possible to maintain the livelihood of the workers. Zhou stated that he would accept it and forward it to the municipal government for implementation as soon as possible. The representatives then went to the municipal government to petition, where they were received by Dai, a staff member, who promised to forward it to the mayor for review. Finally, they went to the Social Affairs Bureau to make the same petition.</p>
<p>Rickshaw Owners' Association</p>
<p>Negotiates for Reduction in Inspection Frequency</p>
<p>According to the Continental News, the Shanghai Rickshaw Owners' Association convened a general meeting on the 3rd to discuss the Public Works Bureau's proposal to inspect vehicles monthly. It was generally agreed that the current cost of materials is high, and frequent inspections would result in losses for the rickshaw pullers. It was decided to negotiate with the Public Works Bureau to reduce the inspection frequency to a maximum of once every two months. In addition, a reorganization committee was elected to supervise the cleanliness and hygiene of rickshaws.</p>
<p>Xu Shiying, et al.</p>
<p>Send a Letter Requesting Generous Relief for Anhui Disaster</p>
<p>Xu Shiying, Chairman of the Anhui Provincial Disaster Relief Fundraising Committee, and Wang Yitang and Bai Wenwei, the vice-chairmen, sent a letter yesterday to the Shanghai Temporary Charity Fundraising Association for the Henan, Anhui, and Hubei Disaster Areas, requesting generous relief for the Anhui disaster after the champagne ticket lottery. The original text is as follows: "Respectfully replying, we received your telegram yesterday, which we have carefully read. We found that the existing relief funds of the committee are only this amount. We can first receive more than 5,000 yuan and continue to allocate funds when we have more funds. We are sending a special telegram to reply, hoping you will check and approve. The amount of 5,000 yuan has been remitted by the Shanghai Taiping Bank today. However, the disaster area is vast, and the need for relief is particularly urgent. We are grateful for your promise to continue to allocate the remaining 5,000 yuan. We dare to ask you to collect enough funds and allocate them in advance. We also ask the association to give priority to the Anhui disaster when distributing relief funds after the champagne ticket lottery. We are extremely grateful and specially reply to you, enclosing a receipt for your reference."</p>
<p>Where Did the Bombs Come From at Xieshunxiang?</p>
<p>The Owner Claims He Does Not Sell Enemy Goods</p>
<p>The Xieshunxiang Cotton Cloth Store Wholesale Department, located at No. 115, No. 17, opposite Baoyu Lane, Caishi Street, French Concession, is opened by Ling Jigen from Ningbo and specializes in the wholesale of cotton cloth. The business is usually prosperous. At 7:30 PM yesterday (the 6th), a three- or four-inch-long, melon-shaped bomb with a button was found on the cement floor in front of the door. It did not explode. After someone reported it to the police station, Chinese and Western detectives were immediately dispatched to the wholesale department to inquire. The owner claimed that the store does not sell enemy goods and provided the detectives with the trademarks of the cloth he sells for inspection. The bomb was then taken back to the police station for disposal.</p>

<p>Deqing County Nephew Kidnapping Case</p>
<p>Meeting to Discuss Details at Longhua Airport</p>
<p>Using Braised Duck, Cigarettes, and a Large Number of Tonics as a Code</p>
<p>Detectives Disguised as Victims to Negotiate</p>
<p>丨Three Kidnappers Arrested One After Another丨</p>
<p>Pan Fujia, a resident of Panjiadai, Deqing County, Zhejiang Province, was kidnapped on April 23 of this year. At the same time, a nephew of Pan was also kidnapped, and a meeting was arranged in Shanghai to discuss the ransom. A few days ago, Lou Ying, the chief prosecutor of the Shanghai Local Court, forwarded a letter from the Deqing County Government stating that the kidnappers had come to Shanghai and agreed to meet to discuss the ransom. The Deqing County Government requested the Municipal Public Security Bureau to investigate the case and bring the perpetrators to justice. The letter was accompanied by a letter signed by Shen Shaozeng, the main points of which were:</p>
<p>"The First Army of the World</p>
<p>will pass through this place. Due to insufficient military pay, please borrow silver dollars 58,000. No amount is allowed to be less, and it is not allowed to report to the military police. The meeting place is Shanghai Old Longhua Railway Station South Pier Airport. The time is 5:00 PM when the fourth train arrives. Be sure to be there, rain or shine. First, take 5,000 yuan for food expenses. No amount is allowed to be less, otherwise, the hostages will be beaten to death, and their houses will be burned down. The entire family, big and small, will be killed, and even the chickens and dogs will not be spared." After receiving the letter, Director Wen immediately ordered Lu Ying, the captain of the Detective Team of the bureau, to handle the case. After receiving the order, Lu dispatched detective team leaders Gu Liancheng and Gao Wansheng to investigate and found out that the meeting was scheduled for 5:00 PM on the previous day (the 4th) at</p>
<p>Longhua Airport</p>
<p>The victims were instructed to bring two green-skinned sugar canes, two braised ducks, ten tins of White Golden Dragon cigarettes, one catty and four taels of white fungus, and one catty of Korean ginseng as a code. The matter was reported to Captain Lu, who immediately dispatched detectives, including Wu Tianxiang, all in disguise, to drive to the address. Detective Wu Tianxiang, disguised as the victim, carried the items and wandered around the airport, pretending to wait for contact. At 5:00 PM, the bandits were seen coming face to face. One of the bandits and detective Wu Tianxiang</p>
<p>began negotiations.</p>
<p>After a while, two more bandits held Wu and walked away. Seeing the situation, the detectives rushed out and surrounded them in an instant. Wu Tianxiang also immediately abandoned the items he was carrying on the rickshaw and shouted loudly to catch the kidnappers. Seeing that things had been exposed, the bandits ran away. Detective Wu Tianxiang arrested one of the bandits, who struggled hard. Wu held on tightly. At the same time, detective Pan Huanzhang also</p>
<p>captured a suspect.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, more than ten soldiers from the First Battalion of the First Regiment of the Garrison Department stationed there surrounded and arrested another bandit named Li Xiaoyun and sent him to the military law office for interrogation. He was taken back to the detective team the day before yesterday and detained together. In the morning, the kidnappers confessed that Zhang Shunqing, 29 years old, from Hubei, lived in Xinfan Village, outside the East Gate of Jiaxing, and was a farmer. On the 29th day of the lunar March, he and his accomplices Liu Yuqing and others took a rifle and a pistol each to the countryside of Deqing County and kidnapped the hostages,</p>
<p>a nephew and an uncle.</p>
<p>The hostages were sent to a large temple in the countryside of Taitou and hid. A letter was sent to their family members, asking them to send someone to Shanghai to negotiate. Therefore, I and Liu Yuqing and Li Xiaobao and others took a boat from Taitou to Wuzhen and then took a fast boat to Jiaxing. We took a special express train at 8:00 PM to Shanghai South Station. The three of us hired a rickshaw and first went to the Central Hotel to open room number 7. Then we went to the airport to negotiate and were arrested. The hostages are still in the countryside of Taitou,</p>
<p>in a large temple in the mountains. I can lead the way to get them out." The bandit Li Xiaoyun Hong, 25 years old, from Henan, lived in Shentang, outside the East Gate of Jiaxing, and made a living by farming. He firmly denied the kidnapping case. Suspect Jiang Jingshen, 23 years old, from Qingpu, lived in Sijing and worked in Fang Jiulun's silk and cloth shop. He came to Shanghai to visit his brother Jiang Meichun's house in the Tongleju teahouse in Longhua and was arrested while walking with his niece. He knew nothing about other things and asked for an investigation to find out the truth. After verifying the confession, Captain Lu sent the three people to the Third Section of the General Bureau for interrogation yesterday.</p>
<p>Preserving Temple Sites for Education</p>
<p>丨The Municipal Government Formulated Four Measures丨</p>
<p>The ancient Jingde Temple in Jiangwan, also known as the Dongyue Temple or the Dongwang Temple, has its eastern houses rented by Dongjiang Elementary School. Last summer, the municipal party headquarters stated that the temple abbot colluded with unscrupulous people to collect money from the public and sent a letter to the municipal government for investigation. The municipal government ordered the Public Security Bureau and the Social Affairs Bureau to ban it and ordered the Jiangwan Municipal Committee to take over and keep custody of it together with the police station in charge. Before a method for banning prostitution records is determined, it will be temporarily retained and dealt with slowly. However, the temple was completely destroyed during the January 28th Incident. The municipal government authorities have formulated the following four temporary custody measures with the principles of preserving historical sites and using them for education: (1) The temple will be kept in custody by the Jiangwan District Municipal Committee and the head of the district in charge. (2) The gate tower of the ancient Jingde Temple, the imperial decree stele of Song Jianyan, and the Hall of Martyrs in the right hall should be preserved for the purpose of preserving historical sites and for people to admire, but they must not attract pilgrims or promote superstition. (3) The remaining base and houses will be used for education, converted into middle-level vocational schools and Dongjiang Elementary School buildings, and managed by the Municipal Education Bureau. (4) The temple side must never privately buy or sell, and the municipal government will add a certificate of proof.</p>

<p>After the Dumping of Japanese Crucibles</p>
<p>Chinese and Foreign Merchants Are Greatly Affected</p>
<p>Prices Fall by 30 to 40 Yuan Compared to Before Dumping</p>
<p>The Sales of Our Country's Upstream Can Still Be Barely Maintained</p>
<p>Chinese Merchants Express Their Determination to Persist to the End</p>
<p>Crucibles (i.e., graphite) are one of the main products of modern industry, and the world's production areas are very scarce. It is found that the provinces in our country that have discovered this mineral include Hunan, Guangdong, Zhejiang, and Shaanxi. After mining, only Limin Company in Jiangjiashan, Wugangshan, Xiashu, Jiangsu, has achieved effective results that can compete with imported goods. Japan itself does not have this mineral. The mines that are transported to Shanghai for dumping are half in Korea and half in Andong, China. Since Japan occupied our Eastern Provinces, the minerals have also been seized by them. Although the mine has been discovered in Shaanxi recently, due to economic reasons, it has not been possible to start mining immediately. The rest are unable to transport them to Shanghai for sale due to poor quality or inconvenient transportation. Recently, due to the dumping of Japanese goods in Shanghai, not only Chinese merchants have been affected, but also American goods have been stagnant. A reporter from the Shenshi News Agency made a special trip to investigate the various parties, and the results obtained are described in detail below.</p>
<p>Production Survey</p>
<p>This mineral is in the Far East, and those belonging to our country are Hunan, Guangdong, Zhejiang, Shaanxi, etc. In Jiangsu, it is in the Xiashu Town area of Jurong County. Those belonging to Japan are half in Korea and half in Andong County, China. This mine originally belonged to us and is now seized by the Japanese. The annual output is at least 500 to 600 tons in Xiashu and at most 3,000 to 4,000 tons. If economic problems can be solved, it can be expanded at any time.</p>
<p>Factory Statistics</p>
<p>The companies that manage or sell this mineral can be divided into three categories. Those belonging to China are Limin, Baoxing, Guangji, Tongji, and Lifeng. Their sales are all completely domestic products. Tongde and Tongxing sometimes purchase domestic products and sometimes purchase Japanese goods. Those who sell Japanese goods completely are Xinki Industrial Raw Materials Company, Qiyu, and Yaohua. The trademarks are Limin uses Alarm Clock, Baoxing uses Gem, and Xinki uses Sweetheart with Chinese and Indian characters for Xinki. However, the factory sometimes purchases mineral blocks from Japan, mixes them with machine-made powder, and pretends to be domestic products, with ten bags per ton, printed with the words "completely domestic products" on the outside. Yaohua's trademark is unknown. As for American goods, they are not natural products and are made of coal, so the quality is extremely high and the price is also very high.</p>
<p>Comparison of Quality</p>
<p>American goods are made of coal, so their quality is superior to natural products. Their chemical analysis shows that the carbon content reaches 95 degrees. Japanese goods are 38.5 degrees and one is 68.4 degrees. However, domestic goods are currently actively improving, and their goal must be to exceed Japanese goods and compete with American goods.</p>
<p>Sales Channels for Various Goods</p>
<p>The most prosperous sales channel for this mineral is the local port, followed by the ports along the Yangtze River. There are approximately eight major uses: (1) manufacturing dry batteries, (2) carbon brushes, (3) pencils, (4) sand casting, (5) metallurgy, (6) coal stove powder, (7) fire bricks, and other electrical supplies. The tariff is set at 5% of the value. However, domestic goods must increase the 125% surtax compared to Japanese goods.</p>
<p>Dumping Situation</p>
<p>The market price of various goods before the dumping of Japanese goods was 160 yuan for Grade A, 130 yuan for Grade B, and 110 yuan for Grade C. Domestic goods were 90 yuan to 120 yuan for Grade A and 60 yuan to 90 yuan for Grade B. Now Japanese merchants are trying to achieve exclusive dominance in our country's market and are implementing a dumping policy. The prices of Grades A, B, and C have gradually fallen, and the current market price is 40 yuan lower than when it did not fall. The impact on Chinese and foreign merchants in Shanghai is 20%. However, according to a Chinese merchant, no matter how Japanese goods are dumped, our country's merchants are fully prepared and will persist to the end without the slightest concession. On the one hand, we hope that all sectors will not use enemy goods to win the final victory.</p>
<p>Refusal to Reduce Taxes</p>
<p>Domestic products are being squeezed out by Japanese goods. In fact, the Japanese side has the government as a shield, while we sell them in our own country and transfer them to other ports, and we have to pay taxes again. Moreover, the customs must add a 12% surtax. In fact, the tax amount for domestic products is higher than that of imported products. To resist for a long time, we must find a way to reduce the tax amount. According to Mr. Zhang, the manager of Limin Company, who spoke to a reporter from the Shenshi News Agency, he has contacted the Ministry of Finance several times to request the removal of the surtax to seek the survival of domestic goods. However, the Ministry of Finance believes that this matter is of great importance and has not yet approved it. At the end of the National Railway Exhibition of Products along the Railway Lines of the Ministry of Railways, Mr. Huang Boqiao of the two railway bureaus expressed that in the future, the freight for domestic goods can be calculated at 80% of the current freight to provide relief. If it can be realized, it will be a small compensation for the transportation of domestic products.</p>
<p>Used to be a tea server in a certain旅舎, but now he is unemployed at home and has been for several years. His wife, Feng, gave birth to a son named Shui, who is now grown up. The mother and son both work in a certain sock factory to make a living, but their income is very meager, so they are always unable to make ends meet. They rent a room on the third floor of the Shengfei Bicycle Shop at No. 799 Avenue Joffre. Yuan used to suffer from a serious illness, but now it has relapsed, causing him to feel even more annoyed due to poverty and illness. He suddenly had the idea of ​​committing suicide. The other day, when his wife and children went out, he hanged himself with a rope. Later, the shop assistant of the bicycle shop, Tan Jinlin, found him and tried to untie him. However, he only had a breath left and immediately reported it to the Jingansi Police Station, which ordered Chinese detective Zhu Shanghe to go to investigate. He was sent to Baolong Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective, and he soon died. The corpse was then carried to the forensic examination office on Philan Road. Yesterday morning, he reported to the First Special District Local Court, which appointed Prosecutor Guo Wei to come to the office to examine the corpse. After examining the corpse, he rose to the case and interrogated Yuan Feng, the wife of the deceased, who stated that her husband had not had a decent job for three years, resulting in extreme economic hardship. All the clothes and belongings in the family had been pawned. Recently, his old illness relapsed again. Her mother and son found it difficult to do hard work and did not blame him. This time, he suddenly committed suicide, fearing that it was caused by poverty and illness. After obtaining the confession, Guo Jun ordered that the examiner Yuan Yunquan, who was indeed a suicide, hand over the corpse to his wife Yuan Feng for collection and burial.</p>
<p>The Public Works Bureau Open-Air Swimming Pool Will Open</p>
<p>The Public Works Bureau's open-air swimming pool on Jiangwan Road is scheduled to open on the 15th of this month. Tickets are 20 cents for Tuesdays and Fridays and 50 cents for other days. However, a book of three tickets costs one yuan. Private groups who want to use it exclusively are limited to 9:00 PM to 11:00 PM. The date will be determined separately. For details, contact the sanitation inspection director of the North District and Central District in the Public Works Bureau's cleaning section at No. 16 Hankou Road. Inquiry time is 11:00 AM to 12:00 PM.</p>
<p>Municipal Public Works Bureau</p>
<p>Restoration of Disaster Area Projects</p>
<p>The city suffered too much damage due to the January 28th Incident, and the scars are still visible everywhere. The municipal government is making every effort to carry out restoration work, but due to limited funds and the vast urban area, the projects are scattered in all directions, which is not very eye-catching. Many people in the community have doubts because they cannot understand the situation. After learning about the progress of the Public Works Bureau's restoration projects, I would like to describe them as follows. I think they will be welcomed by those who care about municipal administration. (1) Roads: Except for the Zhabei District, where construction cannot begin until the North Station is relocated and the plan is revised, the side stones have been replaced and the road surfaces have been repaired in other districts of Wusong, Jiangwan, Pudong, and Humen, as well as the main roads in the urban area, for a total length of more than 54,000 meters, and two-fifths of them have been completed. (2) Ditches: The design and construction of drainage ditches have been completed in Wusong, Jiangwan, and Humen Fangxie Road, with a total length of about 12,000 meters of branch ditches. One-third of them have been completed, with more than 60 cellars. (3) Bridges: The Qingyun Road Bridge and the Tiantong'an Road Bridge have been completed. The Qujiang Road Bridge, Bazhi Bridge, Linping Road Bridge, Tiantong Road Bridge, and No. 6 Jia Bridge in Pudong Road are under construction. (4) Guangfu Road Embankment: The former suddenly collapsed, causing the road surface to crack and traffic to be blocked. It has been under construction since December of last year and will be completed soon. The above are all the completed and ongoing projects, and the others that are being planned will continue to be carried out.</p>
<p>Social Affairs Bureau Improves Infant Care Services</p>
<p>Pilot Project to Be Launched First at the Shanghai Infant Care Hall</p>
<p>Wu Xingya, Director of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, previously saw a report in a local newspaper about the transformation of infant care halls. One passage stated, "One nanny has to take care of seven or eight or even a dozen children, and the milk is not enough, and the care is inadequate." He was quite shocked and ordered the department in charge to investigate and rectify it thoroughly. The department then sent personnel to inspect separately. It was reported that the expenses of the various infant care halls were tight and the equipment was insufficient. However, each nanny generally breastfeeds two infants. Even when there are very few unavoidable situations, breastfeeding three infants is only a very short-term phenomenon. Moreover, there is no situation where milk powder is used for adjustment. The bureau has ordered the directors of the various halls to improve it thoroughly and convened the directors of the various halls and representatives of the Health Bureau to the bureau on the 2nd of this month to discuss the improvement of infant care issues. Chen Lengseng, director of the Charity Section, presided over the meeting. The directors of the various halls reported on the recent situation. The chairman put forward the following suggestions for improvement: (1) Infants should be examined when they enter the hall. (2) When hiring nannies, attention should be paid to whether their physical fitness is healthy and whether they have hidden diseases. (3) Infants should live in fresh air. (4) Sick infants should be absolutely isolated. (5) Attention should be paid to the cleanliness and hygiene of the infant care hall at all times. (6) Each nanny should not breastfeed more than two infants. Sun Jiadu, a representative of the Health Bureau, reported that it is necessary to examine the nannies. However, infants with congenital diseases are also easily transmitted to the nannies and should also be examined. The Health Bureau hopes to designate an infant care organization to try scientific methods and improve them item by item. The bureau will assign a professional to reside and guide them and hire a pediatrician as a consultant. The required expenses will be budgeted for from the original budget of the various groups. If there is insufficient, additional funds will be raised. The chairman expressed his approval and planned to launch a pilot project first at the Shanghai Infant Care Hall. After achieving results, they will be promoted and imitated. Fei Chunyun, the director of the hall, promised to report to the Shanghai charity groups and then reply.</p>
<p>Zhu Ziqiao Sends a Letter Requesting</p>
<p>Chinese and Western Pharmacies Donate Medicines</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu Ziqiao sent a letter to Chinese and Western pharmacies yesterday, requesting donations of medicines. The letter stated that the invasion of the violent Japanese has aroused national indignation. Recently, the soldiers in Luan Yu and Rehe Xifeng Kou areas have fought bravely and loyally defended the country. As a result, the wounded are scattered all over the fields, which is extremely tragic. Although we have contacted various charitable groups and the Red Cross to set up wounded soldier hospitals to provide medical assistance, the war zone is vast, and transportation is difficult. We have yet to secure the necessary resources. The war is in full swing, and the need for medicines is extremely urgent. If we do not provide assistance, we will feel ashamed of ourselves. We have always admired your patriotism and compassion. Therefore, we are sending you a letter, sincerely requesting you to donate medicines, the more the better. We will be grateful for your approval. Please indicate the quantity, and we will forward it on your behalf.</p>
<p>Merchants and Citizens on Fourth Avenue</p>
<p>Request a Ban on Selling Fake Watches and Obscene Films Along the Road</p>
<p>The Fourth Avenue Businessmen's Association and the Citizens' Association 20th District Branch sent a letter to the Public Works Bureau Police Department and the Chinese Ratepayers Association requesting a ban on selling fake watches and obscene photos along the road by hooligans. The letter is excerpted as follows: "Respectfully, according to the claims of more than 20 members, including the Meida Company, Meihua Company, Taidong Bookstore, and Cuitaixiang Store, in this area (Fuzhou Road) from Shandong Road to Shanxi Road, there are hooligans who are selling fake gold watches along the road, even colluding to pretend to be customers to deceive and extort money. When the police come, they have accomplices to inform them and escape without a trace. There are also many unemployed vagrants selling obscene photos and vendors selling odds and ends, causing the sidewalks to be blocked. The stores are harassed all day long, which has a huge impact. Therefore, we respectfully request that your association send a letter to the Public Works Bureau to strictly prohibit it to maintain our business." "According to this, our association immediately sent personnel to investigate the claims of the members and found that they were true. This situation is a characteristic of this</p>

<p>— By JULES RENARD, translated by Lin Qu</p>
<p>Lepic had just returned from Paris that morning. He opened his suitcase and took out several gifts for Nicolas Félix and daughter Ernestine. These were beautiful gifts, exactly the ones they had been thinking about all night (how strange!). Afterwards, Lepic put his hands behind his back, looking slyly at Carrot Top and said:</p>
<p>"And you, what do you want? Would you like a trumpet, or a pistol?"</p>
<p>In reality, we wouldn't call Carrot Top a brave child. Between the trumpet and the pistol, he preferred the trumpet, because the trumpet wouldn't shoot anything out of his hands. But he often heard people say that children his age should only play with weapons, command knives, and other tools of war. At his age, he should be smelling gunpowder and destroying things. His father knew his child well; he must have brought what he needed.</p>
<p>"I want a pistol," he said boldly, thinking he must have guessed correctly.</p>
<p>He even went further, adding:</p>
<p>"There's no need to hide it anymore: I've already seen it!"</p>
<p>"Ah!" Lepic said, looking flustered, "You want a pistol! So you've changed completely?"</p>
<p>Carrot Top quickly changed his tune:</p>
<p>"No. Never mind? Grandpa, I was just being naughty. Please rest assured, I don't like pistols at all. Quickly give me my trumpet, so I can blow it for you with relish."</p>
<p>But Lepic said:</p>
<p>"Then why did you lie? To make your father sad, is that it? Since you like the trumpet, you shouldn't have said you liked the pistol; and since you haven't seen anything, you shouldn't have said you saw the pistol. So, to prevent you from lying next time, you won't get the pistol or the trumpet. Look, this trumpet has three red tassels and a flag with gold fringe. Look your fill. Now, go to the kitchen and see if I'm done yet; scram, go, and blow your own fingers like a trumpet."</p>
<p>In the top compartment of the cabinet, on top of a pile of white sheets, Carrot Top's trumpet, adorned with a red tassel and a flag with gold fringe, was waiting to be blown. It was out of reach, unseen, quietly there as if with no hope of ever seeing the light of day.</p>

<p>Gold</p>
<p>Gold Price Continues to Drop by 9.7 Yuan</p>
<p>US Government Takes No Action to Stabilize Gold Yuan</p>
<p>Since the gold market retraced the other day, the trend hasn't looked promising. This is because the US government may not take any action to stabilize the gold yuan before the London Conference. The foreign exchange market trend will rise again. Although yesterday's telegraph from London decreased by 25, the exchange rate between Britain and America rose sharply by 6.375, the US dollar rose by 625, the forward silver price rose by 4.5%, the private telegram added 3.125, American cotton also rose by 25 pounds, the wool market initially opened at 28-9 yuan, then rose to 33-4 yuan. The fluctuations were still relatively flat after the opening. The domestic market was extremely firm, and morale was good, rising and falling entirely with the foreign exchange market. Initially retreating to 28 yuan, it then rose back to 38 yuan. In the end, the banks were still congested, and the midday closing was still low. Sellers were excited during the half-day, but due to market sentiment, the decline was still small. During another period, it may not be limited to this number. Although the market price of smelted red gold nominally increased by 62 yuan, the actual transaction price was probably 68 yuan more. As for swaps, because HSBC's quoted price continued to be close, short sellers were unwilling to pay more, so few transactions took place. Here is a record of today's half-day market situation:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 932 yuan, down 7.5 yuan from the previous closing. The spot price opened at 2.2 yuan. The foreign exchange market opened with the British pound firm by 125, the recent selling price was 1 shilling 3 pence and 0.0625, the American dollar at 1875, and for 95 yuan, morale was still stable. Da Xing Yong immediately entered the market to buy. Qian Chang Xiang Heng Xing also bought. Mitsui, although holding on to the August American dollar at 5625, was still able to get as high as 5 yuan. Shun Li sold. Citibank came out with the August American dollar at 625, and Fu Chang Heng Yu also sold. It retreated to 0.3 yuan, and it was difficult to sell the August American dollar at 6875. Bing Xing sold to 99 yuan, Qing Fa Yong Jin added up 2.5 yuan. Banque Sino-Belge offered the June American dollar at 375. Mitsui held on to the July 5625 even more. Fu Yu and Fu Chang sold the contracts and went for 98 yuan. Shanghai bought the August American dollar at 8125, and Da Xing Yong Zhao Feng Chang took the contracts, rising to above 30 yuan. After HSBC's listing, the foreign exchange market gradually became tighter. Bing Xing limited the market to buy, and rose sharply from 98 yuan. Mitsui took the August American dollar at 75, and the July 5625 was difficult to settle. At this time, it was 32 yuan. Chase offered the June American dollar at 3125. Rui Xing sold the contracts, retreating by 1 yuan. Overseas Chinese bought the August American dollar at 6875, and then took the July 4375. Fu Yu entered the market to buy, morale was extremely stable, and the rise was quite rapid. The domestic market was slightly tight. Before long, the August American dollar at 625 was difficult to settle, and it surged to 38 yuan. The spot price was sold, gradually retracing. Shanghai sold the July American dollar at 4375 to a peer, and Zhao Feng Chang sold first, retreating to within 6 yuan. Not long after, Banque Sino-Belge sold the July 4375 to Guang Bang, and Heng Xing sold contracts in the market, retreating to around 3 yuan, probably because Chase sold the June American dollar at 25 to Zhong Nan. Pan Gen bought the July half yuan, with a slight rebound. Despite the banks' inclination to hold, Mitsui offered the July 4375. Hong Li and Heng Yu sold to 0.1 yuan, but the August American dollar at 1.5 yuan was for sale. Fu Yu went up to 2.8 yuan. Banque Sino-Belge sold the August 6875, and the July 5625, Yuan Heng and Fu Chang competed to sell, breaking 30 yuan again. After entering, the August American dollar at 8125 was also difficult to sell. Bing Xing desperately sold off, and retreated to around 98 yuan. Many people took the contracts at low prices. Bing Xing repeatedly sold, and struggled around 9 yuan for a long time. Heng Xing also came to buy contracts, and the midday closing was 929 yuan and 8 jiao. The spot price was 9 yuan and 5 jiao. The highest price during the half-day was 938 yuan, and the lowest was 98 yuan, with a fluctuation of 10 yuan. The result was a decline of 9.7 yuan compared to the previous closing.</p>
<p>The quoted price was 94.875 yuan, half a yuan higher than the HSBC American dollar listing. The alloy price was 964 yuan, 8 jiao, and 2 fen. According to the closing price, it was approximately 35 yuan less, about 10 yuan less than the previous closing. The registered price for this month was 958 yuan, for June 930 yuan, and the supplementary water was 958 yuan. The opening price for smelted red gold was 62 yuan more, but there were few transactions. There were still many buyers in the market. The official transaction was later 68 yuan more. However, it was refined to 992, which was 6 points higher than the ordinary purity. It was bought by the Laofengxiang from the silversmiths. The spot was sold by Ying Feng Heng. The turnover was less than 100 taels. The market trading was still exciting. In summary, Heng Xing Qing Fa Yong Da Xing Yong Fu Yu Qian Chang Xiang Heng Tai Yuan Mao Yong Zhao Feng Chang and others were sellers, while Bing Xing Fu Chang Rui Xing Hong Li Yuan Heng Heng Yu Chun Yuan Yong Wan Xing Ren Fa Yong were sellers. Da Lian Bang Shun Li Wan Xing differed slightly in intention. Shun Li bought more, Wan Xing sold more, Guang Bang bought. The largest number of transactions in June was still accounted for by Da Lian Bang, with Shun Li over 3,300 and Wan Xing over 2,600. In addition, Yuan Heng, Yuan Mao, Yong Tong Feng Heng Bing Xing were also above 1,000, Fu Chang more than 910 contracts. The largest short seller was Da Xing Yong, with a total of 4,000.

The recent selling price was 1 shilling 3 pence and 1875 for the British exchange and 25.25 yuan for the American exchange.

In the gold industry, both Gang Bang and Da Lian Bang bought, with an estimated purchase of 200,000. The trend seemed loose, but in reality, the price of the American dollar was difficult to stabilize temporarily, the exchange rate looked long, and the economic war was feared to restart.

<p>Securities</p>
<p>Government Bonds Plunged into Extreme Desolation</p>
<p>One Jiao More Is Deemed High, One Jiao Less Is Deemed Low</p>
<p>Such a Dull Situation Is Truly Rare</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, government bonds became increasingly listless, and the small amount of transactions was truly rare. In the two morning sessions, a total of over 1.6 million was transacted, mostly for speculative buying and selling. Customer transactions were few and far between. A kind of indifferent and dispirited state made the people gathered in the market increasingly scarce. Because the term of this month was still far away, and the environmental situation was becoming increasingly dull, speculators temporarily ceased their activities. In addition, due to Saturday, the market was even more lacking in spirit. In the morning head-plate trading, there were scattered sellers, down by a small 1-2 jiao, but still a few buyers and sellers. The second plate trading was the clearest, apart from 6-7 types of the coming months that had not yet opened, the rest mostly consisted of transactions of 5,000 to 10,000. The market price was either high or low, not exceeding a jiao, with a great tendency to deem one jiao more as high and one jiao less as low. The trend seemed relatively stable, because the 14th and 21st slightly bought in, each plate slightly rose by one jiao or two jiao, but the result for the whole day was that eight types rose by one jiao, and the rest ranged from one and a half jiao to two and a half jiao. The stagnation was even worse than before, and the total transaction volume was 3,833,000 yuan. Among them, spot was 3,000 yuan, and futures were all less than 1 million. The most salt tax transactions were only 920,000, consolidated tax 730,000, demobilization only 560,000, and the rest ranged from several tens of thousands to three or four hundred thousand. The shares of the Chinese Merchants Electric Company, which had not been traded for a long time, suddenly had a transaction of 10 shares, priced at 10 yuan and 7 jiao.</p>
<p>New York Stocks Were Firm</p>
<p>Xin Feng Yanghang reported that on Friday (the 5th), the New York stock market, after President Roosevelt's speech to the General Chamber of Commerce yesterday, in which he said that he would use all his strength to focus on the inflation policy, all kinds of stocks and goods suddenly rose, reaching the peak of 1933. Especially foreign purchases were even more enthusiastic, because the value of the American dollar has repeatedly fallen recently, with one yuan being worth about eight jiao. The operating conditions of various businesses have greatly improved, so the market is becoming increasingly firm.</p>
<p>Closing Price Compared to the Previous Day</p>
<p>Thirty Industrial Stocks 79.78 Up 0.62</p>
<p>Twenty Railroad Stocks 35.78 Up 0.26</p>
<p>Twenty Public Utility Stocks 27.05 Up 0.58</p>

<p>Yarn and Cotton</p>
<p>Yarn Numbers Hedged and Sold</p>
<p>The yarn market rose in the morning and fell in the afternoon, and the situation was still flat. However, some began to go long due to the rise in foreign cotton. In addition, raw cotton tended to rise, and the market atmosphere was on the rise. However, in the afternoon, a factory opened 4,500 bales and accepted the yarn number, and sold it in the futures market, so the market fell in connection.</p>
<p>People's Standard Rose High in the Morning and Fell Low in the Afternoon</p>
<p>At the opening of the People's Standard market, the atmosphere was good, and the buying trend was hot again. Each month rose by 5, 6, and 7 jiao. In the afternoon, it was heard that manufacturers had opened up, and general buyers and sellers sold off, the market suddenly fell, each month fell by 8, 9 jiao to 1.2 and 1.3 yuan. The total transaction volume for the whole day was 41,100 bales. The sale of Chang Feng was 3,550 bales, Yong Da 1,600 bales, Yong Chang 850 bales, Feng 750 bales, and Tong Fu 750 bales.

<p>The spot yarn was still selling well. The total number of statistics bought by various gangs throughout the day was 803 bales, and the price rose by 5 jiao. Shenxin Factory opened 4,500 bales of 20-count Man Bell, for the June, July, August, and September terms, priced at 198 yuan and 7 jiao and a half. The purchase amount of each gang is as follows:</p>
<p>Guangdong 490 Mainland 37 Wuhu 11 Nanjing 5</p>
<p>Shantou 10 Fellow Traders 120 Changsha 30</p>
<p>Loose Shorts Compensated and Marked Flowers</p>
<p>The cotton market's rise was quite intense, due to the trend of American cotton, but the silver price was prolonged, the city was still flat, so the general loose shorts were found to be panic-stricken, and there were extremely popular rumors in the business market, saying that Japanese merchants had a large number of spot cotton transactions, but Japanese factories reduced work day by day, and the material was of course less used.</p>
<p>Zheng Standard Was Nimble</p>
<p>At the opening of the Zheng Standard market, there were many buyers, and loose shorts only supplemented. The near term rose by 5 and 6 jiao, and the far term rose by 1.2 and 3 jiao. In the afternoon, the market atmosphere was slightly flat, each month fell by 5 fen to 1.2 and 3 jiao. The total transaction volume for the whole day was 133,800 dan. The sale of Chun Ji was 3,600 dan, Ming De 3,700 dan, Yi Chang 3,300 dan, Chang He 3,900 dan, Yuan Da 2,600 dan, Sen Kang 1,800 dan.

<p>July 4440 45 126,000</p>
<p>Factory Needs Are Completely Absent</p>
<p>There were no spot cotton transactions, because the futures rose too sharply. Factories, due to the sluggish yarn market, refused to handle high-priced raw materials, so no transactions could be made.</p>
<p>Foreign Cotton Was Firm as Usual</p>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton was lively and firm due to the Wall Street side and poor Western forecasts. The result was a large increase of 25 pounds for spot and 245 pounds for futures. In the Liverpool cotton market, spot was up by 10 points, and futures were up by 10 and 11 points. Egyptian cotton spot was up by 13 points. In the Bombay cotton market, prices rose due to short covering and purchases by speculators and Japanese merchants. As a result, Ping Gal was down by 1 rupee and 2 jiao and a half, Om La was up by 2 rupees and 2 jiao and a half, and Bai Luo Xi was up by 1 rupee and 2 jiao and a half. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram of the 5th):</p>

<p>After the Inflation Bill Was Passed</p>
<p>American Cotton Demand Expanded Last Week</p>
<p>A New York telegram on the 5th reported on the cotton market for the week, saying that last week, due to the passage of the inflation bill by the House of Representatives and the further drop in the value of the gold yuan, demand expanded accordingly. However, those who settled after the discovery of new high prices also rose accordingly, and sales in the South also began to expand. Various cotton mills in the South have recently purchased a large amount of cotton, which shows that they have been moved. There are warnings of beneficial delays in new cotton planting, and the climate is excellent. On the concept of inflation, everyone tends to go long, and reactions are also likely to be realized. At the same time, many people are also doubtful about whether the impact of the legislative bill can truly reduce cotton fields. However, some people believe that under the rules agreed upon in the rural relief bill, due to voluntary agreement, most of the farmers who can be consulted can reduce their production, or even expand their scope, and abandon some of the fields that have already been sown. The weekend statistics of American cotton are attached as follows (unit: 1,000 bales)</p>
<p>1932 1933</p>
<p>Cumulative Listing This Season 14,033 11,980</p>

<p>American Cotton Extraction Worldwide Since August 1 11,199 10,501</p>
<p>Bombay Cotton Industry Weekly Report</p>
<p>Last week, due to the rise in foreign markets, the trend here was also good. Export inquiries have improved slightly, mostly in Europe. The needs of transport merchants have gradually improved, so people's hearts are more optimistic. There are not many real export transactions, but inquiries are gradually expanding. The position of local yarn factories is very poor, so the arrival and inventory are increasing day by day.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea</p>
<p>Continued Record of Silk Season in Jiangsu and Zhejiang</p>
<p>(Dantu) In recent years, farmers in various cities and villages have adopted a negative attitude towards the matter of silkworms. This is because sericulture has failed for many years, and the silkworm books have suffered heavy losses. This year, the price of rice is also cheap, and the rural economy is panicked. There is no capital for sericulture, so they all find ways to borrow money and owe silkworm seeds from the seed-producing fields to engage in hatching. The weather is sunny and warm, and the collection of ants is quite complete. The sericulture gangs in the southeast villages have had leaves open for many days, and the silkworm season in the northwest villages is later. The large gangs are in the proper leaf stage, and the silkworm ants are developing well, but unfortunately the feeding amount is not strong.</p>
<p>(Xinchang) This year, the sericulture households in the four villages of Xinchang, Zhejiang Province, have bred the indigenous species they retained early because they had no capital for sericulture. Unfortunately, the weather was not good, and most of them abandoned the white cocoons. Therefore, the yellow cocoon sericulture households have books on improving the species. Later, the weather was sunny and warm, and the seedlings were prosperous, and the collection of ants was quite complete, and the development was very smooth, and the instructors also assisted. In the past two days, it was suddenly cloudy and sunny, and suddenly cold and hot, and the adjustments were appropriate. Now the early gangs have completed their third sleep, and the late gangs have just opened their leaves for the second sleep.</p>
<p>Suian New Tea Continues to Arrive in Shanghai</p>
<p>Yesterday, the new green tea from the tea farms on the Suian route, as well as the Shenyuan and other tea lines, arrived with more than a hundred boxes. The shopkeepers distributed samples as usual, and the attitude of the foreign merchants was as yesterday. The first plate has not yet been opened, and there is hope for opening next Monday.</p>
<p>Most of the Indigenous Tea Factories Have Started Work</p>
<p>Yesterday, more than 20 indigenous tea factories had started work, and together with those that had started work in the past few days, there were as many as 37. However, the price of raw tea in the production area is expensive, and most of them are tight.</p>
<p>Fuliang Mao Feng Is on the Market</p>
<p>In recent days, shops and tea merchants in Jingde, Raozhou, and other ports in the southeast villages of Fuliang have been going to the mountains to search for and buy Qing tea. Also, the weather has cleared, and the Guyu Mao Feng is just right for harvesting and manufacturing. In order to produce excellent products, each mountain household is picking tender tea early. In the areas of Siqian, Nan An Tan, and Shi Ding, there has already been a large amount of new tea, with slender branches and a strong aroma. The new price opened at 5 jiao to 7 jiao per catty, depending on the quality of the tea, but the sales were not strong, and all were approved for transaction.</p>
<p>Rice</p>
<p>Thin Rice Sells Well and the Price Rises by Two Jiao</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, 60-70 boats came down the river, and both retail and wholesale sales were strong. The market was initially slightly tight, and the latter market was even more lively. Near noon, the out-of-stock was even stronger, with more than 4,400 bags being moved, which is a good sign that has not been seen in recent months. It is estimated that the Nanyang and Shantou gangs have purchased 5-600 bags of Su Tong thick rice, and the Beiyang and Tianjin Yantai Weihaiwei gangs have purchased more than 4,000 bags of Qingjiao Songjiang Sifeng West Lian and Nanhong thin rice. Therefore, the price of thin rice has risen by two jiao. However, the market price of Su Tong rice and Nanhong thick rice has only risen by a few fen, because the majority are retail. Du Yangjian is still fixed, and Chang Bang rice and Bianyuan are also stable. Yinyuan is short of goods and has a fragrant taste, and the price has risen by a few fen again.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, more than 20 ships came down the river from various routes, and the out-of-stock of white rice shops was active. The customers took off because the prices in the production areas were high and tight, resulting in a tight market shape. There was little arrival of thin rice, and the price increased by two jiao. Early rice was one jiao tighter, indica rice slightly increased by a few fen, and the price of Yin Bianyuan was fixed.</p>
<p>Min and Hakka Are Selling Hakka Indica Smoothly</p>
<p>Yesterday, Hakka Indica was sold smoothly by the Min gang again, with a total transaction volume of 4,600 bags. Except for more than 100 bags of Jiangxi Jiyuan rice that were for social events in this street, all were taken away by the Min gang. Among the Min gangs, the Fuzhou gang accounted for 95%, and only Quanzhou took a few hundred bags of machine-made late rice. The market was originally stable, but it was also sold smoothly by Fuzhou, and the situation was even better. However, the hoarders all had the intention of selling, and seeing that the market was lively, many wanted to sell, so the price could not rise.</p>

<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, the prices of each month showed signs of stabilization. As for the price of foreign wheat, Chicago rose by another three or four jiao, and Canada rose by about seven jiao, so after the opening price, people's hearts in each month had already stabilized, and because the shipping cost of foreign wheat was soaring, it seemed that the prices of foreign goods had already had a foothold, so although the number of buyers was still scarce, people's hearts were not as depressed as they had been a few days ago. Since there were few sellers, and buyers absorbed quite a lot, the opening price was about one fen better than the previous day. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, although the trading in each month was still sluggish, the manufacturers were heard to have recently taken in some in the near term, and the speculative gangs absorbed some in the far term, so the market atmosphere was good. If the price of foreign wheat is better in the future, the market situation in this port may have to rise accordingly. As a result, this month was seven li and a half better than the previous day, June and July were five li better, August was one fen better, September was one fen and two li and a half better, and October was one fen better.</p>

<p>Yesterday, after the future wheat market opened in the morning, although the price of foreign wheat rose by three or four jiao to seven jiao, the market atmosphere was still flat due to the small number of buyers, and there was not much rise or fall compared to the previous day, and the trading was still deserted. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, the flour market had already turned better, and the current price of foreign wheat had also risen. In addition, Argentine wheat had already shouted 4 yuan and 9 jiao, so people's hearts turned better, and the opening price was also slightly more stable than in the morning. However, there were still few buyers, and there was no huge rise or fall. As a result, May and June did not open, July rose by one fen, August rose by two fen, and September and October did not move.</p>

<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>In the past decade, I have repeatedly had a strange dream: I dreamt that I possessed an ability to write a few characters at will, which would then be magnified thousands of times, projected onto the sky, and emit a sparkling light. I told my friends, and some said, "This is just a fantasy after watching a movie." Others said, "With future advancements in science, skywriting might become a reality."</p>
<p>Last month, I bought a collection of poems, "Yi Wei Xuan Poems" by Mr. Fang Zhi. He had a seven-character律詩 titled "Cloud Writing," with a line that read, "The blue sky displays images through cloud writing." This poem had a short preface, which briefly stated: "Throughout my life, I have had many strange dreams, unlike anything in the mortal world. I recall, in my youth, dreaming of four large characters appearing in the sky, 'Loyalty, Filial Piety, Integrity, and Virtue,' each character being over ten feet in diameter, and blue in color. The brushstrokes were strong and vigorous, resembling the style of Yan Zhenqing and Liu Gongquan, and were very endearing. Since then, I have dreamed several times of characters appearing in the sky, but the characters were smaller and more numerous, each character being about a foot in diameter, or arranged in two lines, or dozens of lines. At the time, I could recite the text, but upon waking, I would forget it." It's evident that someone in ancient times had this dream of skywriting before me. The only difference is that they did not sparkle. This year, during Labor Day, Germany celebrated the May Day commemoration with a grand spectacle. At the Tempelhofer Feld training ground, a magnificent fireworks display appeared in the sky, spelling out the words "Germany has been revived!" Alas! Is the fantasy of skywriting truly becoming a reality? Is there a possibility that Mr. Fang Zhi's "Cloud Writing" dream from the Daoguang era and my strange dream of "sky subtitles" from the past decade could both transform from illusion into reality?</p>
<p>Relying on fireworks to display characters in the sky is not a groundbreaking invention. However, with continued research, one day we will be able to write lines of characters on the vast blue canvas of the sky.</p>

<p>— Shi Yan Ye</p>
<p>丨A Farmer's Tale of Blood and Tears丨</p>
<p>A farmer, who had just entered the city and looked pale, recounted the decline of the countryside to me in a sorrowful manner. He was from the heart of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, an area known as the prosperous land of Jiangnan. He said: "At this time of spring, it is the most difficult time for the countryside because the grain at home has run out, and the wheat in the fields is not yet ripe. This is what is meant by the period when the old harvest is gone and the new harvest has not yet come in. On average, in each village, only about one or two out of ten families have enough rice to eat, and another one or two can barely fill their stomachs with coarse grains. The rest are families where clever housewives are sighing and weeping. People will die if they don't eat, and they cherish their lives as much as the wealthy, so they naturally won't sit and wait for death. Therefore, they try every possible way to get even a small amount of rice, treating half a liter or a liter of rice like precious pearls. They take out a little, mix it with a large amount of vegetables grown by the village, and cook a big pot of watery porridge. Although it's so thin that you can only see vegetables and not rice grains, the whole family can fill their empty stomachs bowl by bowl. This half a liter or a liter of rice lasts for two or three days, and then they go to great lengths to get another half a liter or a liter. This is how they get by, waiting until the end of the fourth month of the lunar calendar when the silkworms are mature and the wheat is ripe, and they can have some hope of survival."</p>
<p>I asked him why, even though the rice harvest was very bountiful last year, they still had no food like in a famine year. He said: "Last year, each acre yielded three 石 (dan, a unit of dry measure). At the time, the farmers indeed celebrated together in the fields. Unexpectedly, the cheap price of grain hurt the farmers, fulfilling an old saying. Each 石 of rice was only worth five or six yuan, and a hundred catties of grain was only worth one or two silver dollars. Although the harvest was large, the money earned was less, so it was called a bountiful year, but it was actually a year of hardship. Moreover, because of the name of this bountiful year, the rent and taxes were demanded more urgently, and the loans were pressed even harder. Unable to cope, they had to painfully sell the rice cheaply to pay. The cheaper the price, the more rice they had to sell. By the time the poor families barely managed to get through the feared year-end, their granaries were already empty. How can they have any rice to eat this year?"</p>
<p>The rural economy is so withered that it's beyond description. In a village of several dozen families, it's truly as difficult as ascending to the blue sky to collect ten silver dollars in a short time. Sometimes, you can go through the entire village and not even be able to find one silver dollar. The situation is just as barren in the rural towns. It's a common occurrence to hold a five-yuan bill and be unable to exchange it for cash anywhere.</p>
<p>Finally, he said with a sorrowful look at the continuous spring rain: "Last winter and this spring, there were several heavy snows, and work in the fields was impossible. The wheat seedlings have already been damaged. Now, they are suffering from continuous rain, and the soil is becoming increasingly wet, which is the opposite of what wheat needs. This has caused the wheat seedlings to turn yellow and the roots to rot. The future harvest will definitely be discounted. During the Qingming Festival, every family plants soybeans, but the seeds are also rotting and not sprouting. The silkworms have just hatched, and they are also injured by this阴雨寒冷，自也自幼受伤，大来必不康健。麦豆蚕这是农家上半年的三大出産，三者都坏，将来的悽惨，还忍說得嗎？</p>
<p>Alas! The countryside, known as a land of abundance, has already declined so much. One can imagine what it's like in other places. After listening to his account, I also joined him in sobbing.</p>

<p>Because spring will soon vanish, and it's another Sunday with such beautiful weather, it's no wonder that the people visiting Zhaofeng Park are exceptionally crowded.

<h3 id="e6">Drunk <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Chonglou</p>
<p>Drinking too much alcohol causes the nerves to change their normal state. It starts with rambling nonsense, followed by dancing and gesticulating, and finally ends in sound sleep. This is a scene of drunkenness.</p>
<p>Things that can make people drunk are not limited to alcohol. The fragrance of flowers and beautiful colors also have the magic power to intoxicate. However, the states of intoxication are different!</p>
<p>"Everyone in the world is drunk! How can I bear to be the only one sober?" This is the philosophy of decadent Chinese poets. Even though they know that drunkenness is a bad phenomenon, and that one inevitably loses virtue after being drunk, they see that everyone else in the world is drunk! So why shouldn't they be drunk too? Therefore, this kind of decadent philosophy carries the danger of plunging all of humanity into a state of "being in a muddleheaded drunken dream all day long."</p>
<p>The greatest power of "drunkenness" is that it makes people enter into it without realizing it. That's why the Northeast half of our country was lost in the hands of drunkards. Although the generals who refused to resist are all protesting their innocence, the fact that they were captivated by "beauties" and "opium" and were thus slaughtered by strong bandits cannot be concealed.</p>
<p>"Do not laugh at me as I lie drunk on the battlefield; since ancient times, how many warriors have returned from war?" In a time of severe national crisis, how can we not hear such a tragic and heroic cry?</p>

<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Six: In the Sweet and Bitter Love Field, Coldly Observe and Judge Both Sides; On the Rugged Road of Life, a Secret Agreement is Made for Three Years</p>
<p>He called out, holding onto the doorframe, and looked outside, laughing, "Oh, it's Company Commander Yin and Company Commander Zhao, congratulations, promotion and wealth! Please have a seat." As he spoke, he was fastening his buttons under his arm, laughing, "It's really impossible for someone with a nursing child, always having to leave their chest exposed." He came out laughing. Since Zhao and Yin were not outsiders, he casually clasped his fists and wished them a Happy New Year. In this small hall, there was originally only one table and four chairs. Apart from the table, which was already set with offerings, these four chairs were also occupied by things belonging to adults or children. Mrs. Yuan saw that these two guests could only stand on the ground covered with sesame straw debris and couldn't sit down. She kept saying, "It's really a mess," and began to collect and sort the things on the chairs in a flurry, saying, "Please sit, please sit." Zhao Ziqiang saw that he had cleared a chair and was about to sit down. As he lowered his head, he saw a piece of sesame candy stuck to the chair. When he tried to wipe it off with his hand, the candy was stuck tightly to the chair and couldn't be rubbed off. Guan Yaowu saw this and quickly found a small knife to scrape off the piece of candy on the chair board, laughing, "People with children are just like this, naturally saying that our house isn't clean. But you'll have such a day in the future." Yin Deren laughed, "There will be such a day, but I can't have such a day. I'm saying it here, do you believe it or not?" Mrs. Yuan, after a flurry of activity, cleared the things away and brought a teapot and three teacups, placing them on the tea table, laughing, "Company Commander Yin, what do you mean by saying that there won't be such a day?" Yin Deren laughed, "I said there won't be, then there won't be. Everyone look later." Guan Yaowu picked up the child and held him out to Mrs. Yuan, saying, "Here, you hold him." Mrs. Yuan said, "You only held him for a little while, and you're not holding him anymore. I still have to cook." Zhao Ziqiang waved his hand, saying, "No need, we have to rush back to Haidian to eat lunch. As for breakfast, we already ate it in the camp." As they were talking, the child suddenly made a "poop" sound, and a stream of thin yellow excrement came out of his pants, splashing all over Guan Yaowu, dripping from his chest onto his pants, spot after spot, still dripping for a long time.

<h3 id="e8">New Medicine <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>— Ding Meng</p>
<p>Speaking of him, one remembers, but, since September 18th, one hasn't heard Wu Zhihui's wit anymore, and it's rumored that he fell ill. Now a little news is flying out from a special telegram from Nanchang, but even those who have changed their appearance since September 18th, those nationalist scholars who haven't had a trace of news, are also coming to mock him coldly. Why is that? Because of September 18th.</p>
<p>Thinking back, Wu Zhihui's pen and tongue had fulfilled great tasks during the late Qing Dynasty, the May Fourth Movement, the Northern Expedition, the Purge, and even after the Purge when things were still unclear. Yet now that he's speaking up, even those evasive characters are coming to laugh coldly. The airplanes since September 18th have really bombed this party-state's elder statesman, Mr. Wu, or perhaps they've bombed the small courage of some evasive characters.</p>
<p>Since September 18th, things have been different.</p>
<p>There's a fable in an old book about a certain emperor of a certain dynasty whose palace women mostly fell ill and couldn't be cured. Finally, a famous doctor came and prescribed a miraculous remedy: several strong men. The emperor had no choice but to do as he said. After several days, when he went to observe, the palace women were indeed all radiant, but there were many men who were thin and didn't look human, kneeling on the ground. The emperor was shocked and asked what was going on. The palace women whispered in reply: They are the dregs of the medicine.</p>
<p>According to the news in the newspapers a few days ago, Mr. Wu seemed to be like the dregs of the medicine, perhaps even to be trampled on by dogs. However, he is clever and very indifferent, and he certainly wouldn't disregard himself and let others exhaust his sweat. However, because things have been different since September 18th, it's true that a new medicine must be sold. The cold laughter at him is actually the effect of the new medicine.</p>
<p>The properties and taste of this new medicine must be very intense, yet peaceful. For example, in writing, one must first speak of heroic martyrdom for the country, and then describe the martyrdom of beauties for love. One must praise Hitler's cabinet formation while also praising the success of the Soviet Union. After military songs, love songs come. After morality is discussed, brothels are mentioned. One grieves for the willows on the day of national humiliation and remembers roses on May Day. One attacks the enemies of the master and also seems dissatisfied with one's own master... In short, first use a single prescription, and then sell a compound medicine.</p>
<p>Although compound medicines seem like panaceas, they are often ineffective, neither curing the disease nor poisoning the person. However, for patients who mistakenly take this medicine, it can prevent them from seeking good medicine again, prolonging the illness and leading to confused death.</p>
<h3 id="e9">"South" and "North" <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>Ms. Nvren Chuan has repeatedly praised Gu Yanwu's words: "Northerners eat their fill all day long and have nothing to occupy their minds; Southerners gather in groups all day long and speak of things that are not righteous," saying that they hit the nail on the head.</p>
<p>Human bodies are divided into thin and fat, and I belong to the thin ones. Once summer comes, the nightly suffering presses in: mosquitoes buzz in the ears, bedbugs crawl on the neck, and fleas jump in the bedding. We thin friends are greatly threatened and cannot live there for even a day. I once battled mosquitoes and bedbugs until dawn in a small room in a large hotel in Xiaguan, Nanjing, and in the end, I admitted defeat and retreated three times. My fat friends don't take my sleeplessness seriously. Even though bedbugs crawl on their faces, they still say that I'm neurotic, that there's nothing wrong in the world, and that I'm just creating trouble for myself!" It's better for them to snore loudly, "All things grow together without harming each other" and be most secure.</p>
<p>Thin people meet thin people, and they discuss many tricks: "mosquito coils," "mosquito repellent," "Flit," "bedbug powder," "camphor oil," "iodine"... Each provides their own experience for everyone's reference. But when night comes and the enemy attacks again, we still have no trenches to defend. One place itches, one place hurts, and we scratch here and there, still admitting defeat and signing a treaty under duress. Among birds, there is a kind called the "shivering insect" that roosts on branches at night, and it's really hard to bear the wind and rain. So they fly in the air, crying mournfully, "Make a nest tomorrow! Make a nest tomorrow!" As if they are very determined. But the next day, there's nothing like that at all. When dusk comes, they roost on the branches again, crying mournfully again, "Make a nest tomorrow, make a nest tomorrow." The thin person's philosophy of dusk probably comes from this shivering insect.</p>
<p>Thin people mock fat people for being numb, and fat people mock thin people for being neurotic, which at least feeds the mosquitoes, bedbugs, and fleas until they are fat and satisfied, and they put up their feet there in great triumph. If those who "have nothing to occupy their minds" and those who "speak of things that are not righteous" quarrel, Wang Renqiu will certainly laugh loudly beside them: "The people are still the same, the country is still the same, why distinguish between North and South?"</p>
<p>Those who "hold meetings" and "issue declarations" are anxiously worried, and there are many of them between Tianjin and Beijing. Those who "dance" and "play mahjong," how much do the youth of Shanghai and Ningbo allow them? Gu Yanwu's discussion of North and South is not entirely true either. I replied: There are fat people in the South and thin people in the North, but mosquitoes and bedbugs are the same in both North and South. Therefore, I made a combined discussion of "South" and "North."</p>
<h3 id="e10">Reading Tian Han's Operas <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu</p>
<p>The first volume of Tian Han's Collected Operas, "Seven Women in the Storm," published by Shanghai Hufeng Bookstore, contains: "New Year's Eve Dinner," "Plum Rain," "Luan Zhong," "Sweeping," and "Seven Women in the Storm," a total of five plays. The three plays from "Luan Zhong" onwards all take "Anti-Japanese Struggle" as their theme. The background of "Luan Zhong" is the September 18th Incident in Shenyang, the background of "Sweeping" is the loss of Changchun on September 19th, and the background of "In the Storm" is the eve of the January 28th Shanghai War. These three operas have been repeatedly performed and have given people a deep impression.</p>
<p>"New Year's Eve Dinner" writes about how the panic of unemployment shattered the beautiful life fantasies of petty bourgeois professionals, but also led him to the road of revolution. "Plum Rain" writes about the family of a worker under the oppression of unemployment and usury. I think this one is the best.</p>
<p>Because in "Plum Rain," not only does it attack the cruel exploitation of factory owners, where workers lose their lives or become disabled and unemployed in factories with incomplete equipment, but it also exposes how usurers and so-called second landlords suck the workers' blood and sweat. It also contrasts a backward old worker with his progressive wife and daughters, and exposes the mistake of using gangster consciousness and extortion for revenge. This is a very complex theme. Mr. Tian Han drives this complex theme, both concisely and briskly! Finally, he uses the old worker's suicide to declare that there is no way out for backward consciousness, and uses the arrest of the extortioner to point out that gangster consciousness is not the way, and ends with the victory of the mass strike struggle: "Look! Isn't the sky clearing up?" He closed the curtain with such a passionate double entendre!</p>
<p>If one were to say that Tian Han's operas have a shortcoming, it is that there are too many abstract lessons. Then, this "Plum Rain" does not have this shortcoming!</p>
<p>Furthermore, even if Tian Han's operas have a strong romantic color, his vigorous passion often moves people extraordinarily. For example, "New Year's Eve Dinner," "Luan Zhong," and "Sweeping." However, what gives me the greatest joy is still "Plum Rain." Because in this play, in addition to "revolutionary romanticism," it also has a considerable amount of "socialist realism."</p>
<h3 id="e11">Xin Ge'er <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>— Peng Xuezhen</p>
<p>Xin Ge'er's mother gave her only son a fierce glare this day.</p>
<p>Just because, when she was about to leave the factory and return to her hometown, her son said: "Mom, I'm going back with you!" she glared at him with such an angry look.</p>
<p>It was all her eldest brother's instigation: "Xin Ge'er will be fourteen years old after the new year. Farming can't fill your stomach, so why not go to the city, like me, working as a porter? I haven't suffered any losses." The mother was counting on Xin Ge'er alone. She wanted him to learn a skill so that her deceased husband could rest assured. The agreement was made. Her eldest brother asked someone in the city to find Xin Ge'er a position as an apprentice in a construction company. The mother忍着涙替儿子预备铺盖。</p>
<p>The factory owner was a big fat man with a tortoise-shell-rimmed spectacles and a full red face. His imposing manner made the country woman timid for a long time and unable to summon the courage to speak to him.</p>
<p>Xin Ge'er mumbled his mother's instructions and called out "Master".</p>
<p>"The first thing about being an apprentice is to obey orders. You can't be as free as you are in the fields. Eating is not easy, remember! If you don't listen..." Xin Ge'er suspected that this was the three-headed, six-armed devil that country people used to scare children with. "Yes, Master. This is the first time this child has left home, and he hasn't been disciplined. If there's anything wrong, then..." Xin Ge'er didn't know if she was going to say "then hit him" or something else. But in his little heart, he knew: Mom loves her son.</p>
<p>The factory owner stopped talking and waved for her to go back. It was at this moment that Xin Ge'er went up to his mother and said the words that made her glare at him.</p>
<p>Xin Ge'er looked blankly at the factory owner's man-eating face, and let go of his tightly held hand. His mother seemed to have tears in her eyes.</p>
<p>Like a draft ox, Xin Ge'er was led to the foreign-style house that was under construction. He put down the piece of wood on his shoulder, which was three times bigger than himself. His shoulders were sore, and he almost dropped it several times on the street. Then he picked bricks or manure-like mud. Someone taught him how to shout "Hangyu Hangyu," how to be sensible, and how to serve the master...</p>
<p>Xin Ge'er moved carefully with a heavy load on his shoulders, as if he were afraid of disturbing the ground mice. He was covered in foul-smelling sweat. In the evening, he and several partners opened the bedding they had brought from home, which smelled of the sun, in a room. Xin Ge'er lay on it and cried softly, afraid that someone would find out.</p>
<p>When he woke up in the morning, he was starving. The same white rice, the same salty vegetables, made him uneasy. He ate half a bowl and put it down. He stroked the place on his shoulder where he had been hurt by the big piece of wood yesterday, and he felt even more pain.</p>
<p>"But why did Mom leave me here alone? Why did she glare at me so fiercely when I wanted to go home with her?"</p>

<p>— Li</p>
<p>Although the current situation is not peaceful, and the price of grain is falling day by day, and rural poverty is getting worse day by day, the bullfighting tournament is still held as usual. The bullfighting customs of Jinhua are probably not found anywhere else?</p>
<p>"Forcing the Mountain," this famous "martial saint" among bulls, is making a splash here again. It eats things like longan wine, white sugar soup, white rice porridge, and wheat flour gruel. Carloads of soybeans are offered to it, and people are still afraid that it doesn't want them. Every first, tenth, and twentieth day of the month, "Forcing the Mountain" is surrounded by sixteen people, with "command flags" on its back, "naming archways" on its head, and a large red flower on its body. Large gongs lead the way in front. The bull's parents-in-law and uncles follow behind with gift baskets. That kind of majesty is really no less than that of the county magistrate going to the countryside in the former Qing Dynasty.</p>
<p>It is said that "Forcing the Mountain" is the invincible general of the eight surrounding counties, able to knock down famous mountains one after another. When other bulls encounter its continuous forcing attacks, they are mostly defeated and flee, as if the mountains will be forced down by it. Hence the name "Forcing the Mountain."</p>
<p>In general, good fighting bulls must be raised fat and plump. Usually, they are gentle and peaceful in front of people, with peaceful manners. But as soon as they see their own kind, they become imposing, their eyes bulge, and they desperately fight hard, not stopping until they are exhausted and covered in blood. Once defeated, they are killed on the spot and their meat is sold, and they never resist.</p>
<p>"Forcing the Mountain" is such a bull. But although it is said to be a bull, isn't it actually just like a certain kind of person?</p>

<p>— Pu</p>
<p>Readers, everyone knows that today is the eighteenth anniversary (of the Republic of China Year 4 [1915]) of the day when the Japanese government delivered its ultimatum to our government, demanding a satisfactory reply to the Twenty-One Demands by 6:00 PM on May 9th. At that time, Yuan Shikai, preoccupied with actively preparing to become emperor, disregarded the nation's survival and, at 1:00 PM on May 9th, had Foreign Minister Lu Zhengxiang and Vice Minister Cao Rulin go to the Japanese embassy to personally deliver the acceptance document, agreeing to the traitorous demands. From then on, "May Seventh" and "May Ninth" became days of national humiliation in the history of the Republic of China, marked by coercion, shame, and submission.</p>
<p>We know that the "May Seventh" incident gave the Chinese people a great lesson. Since "May Seventh," in the entire political sphere, although it has still been nothing more than the endless succession of old and new warlords and bureaucrats, with no significant progress to speak of, it has had a very, very large impact on the enlightenment of the masses' thinking and the excitement of the national spirit. First, Yuan Shikai, in order to become emperor, did not hesitate to sign traitorous conditions, which aroused national outrage and led to his failure, dealing a fundamental blow to thousands of years of feudal thought. Later warlords and bureaucrats, at least in name, dared not have such ambitions again, and did not dare to casually agree to actions in foreign affairs that would lose national sovereignty. Second, the "May Fourth" Movement was a direct product of the "May Seventh" incident. The explosion of youthful mass thought, the call for literary revolution spread rapidly throughout the country, the establishment of national revolutionary thought, and the awakening of the laboring masses, all contributed to the success of the Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army in the Republic of China Year 15 [1926]. These are all results influenced by the "May Seventh" incident. If we look at the old saying, "A nation without external enemies will perish from internal troubles," then the relationship of the "May Seventh" incident to the revival movement of this ancient nation cannot be said to be unimportant.</p>
<p>However, since the "September 18th" Shenyang Incident, followed by the "January 28th" Shanghai battle and the fall of Rehe this year, until the enemy troops in eastern Hebei have now voluntarily retreated, but Dolon has been lost again, and rumors of divisions among the leaders of the country's military, political, and party factions continue to pour in. The unorganized masses are one thing, but even those who hold the highest political power only have ideals for the overall plan of pacifying internal affairs and resisting external aggression, and rarely see the possibility of putting them into practice. Commemorating "May Seventh" in this situation, where internal strife is unending and external insults are bound to increase, cannot help but make us deeply feel that the stimulation and influence that the "May Seventh" incident gave to the Chinese people has now entered a state of disappearance and decline.</p>
<p>In the future, there will inevitably be more and more national humiliation commemoration days. We believe that the reactionary forces of imperialism will continue to increase, and China will become the main battlefield for this reactionary struggle. We also believe that if those in power in the country in the future want to use the relationship with friendly countries to maintain their own position, then their reactionary means will also work hand in glove with their friendly countries, forming a united front to suppress all the masses they consider to be counter-revolutionary or reactionary. At that time, I think no one will pay attention to the day of "May Seventh" at least, because there will be too many "national humiliations" bigger than it.</p>
<p>But what rescue measures are there? Yes, the day of the Chinese nation's revival will come soon when the national masses are oppressed to a considerable period and the oppressors are exhausted. Now we only have to do our best to do the groundwork for cultivating the national spirit, awakening and organizing the majority of Chinese people.</p>

<h3 id="e14">A Discovery of Truth <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>— Qian Mao</p>
<p>The Unemployed</p>
<p>Before the current social system is changed, young people without the backing of great figures will never be able to find suitable jobs. The jobs they find can be generally described as positions of exploitation. If they resist, they only have to starve until hunger and cold force them to submit. This is the truth I have recently discovered from unemployment.</p>
<p>I was originally a clerk at a certain pharmacy with a monthly salary of forty yuan. I had a mother, a younger brother, and a twenty-year-old wife. Four people lived on this paltry sum of money, and our hardship can be imagined. When I first entered that foreign firm, my job was to type bills. But when the foreign manager saw that I was capable, he asked me to type letters, pack goods, clear customs, and translate Chinese and Western documents and advertisements, adding one thing after another to me. At first, I was quite happy and proud, full of hope that the Westerners would greatly increase my salary. "My future is limitless!" I thought to myself. But year after year, four years passed, and my wages remained</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>unchanged! I was desperate and wrote a letter to request a raise. The reply was very polite, saying that the firm was not making money, but the manager could write a letter to the head office in the United States to inquire. Upon receiving this letter, I began to harbor a mixture of doubt and surprise. However, half a year passed, and the manager not only did not increase my salary, but did not even mention a word about the response from abroad. On the contrary, a Turkish Jewish stenographer who dressed like a prostitute and could not whiten her face was given a raise from two hundred and fifty yuan to three hundred yuan! That morning, I discovered this fact and was so angry that I almost threw the thick ledger on the floor, put on my hat, and left. The words "resign" swirled in my mind for a moment. When I returned home, my wife served me with particular courtesy. During dinner, I told her the details of my situation, and she immediately felt indignant for me, saying "Don't do it! Don't do it!" She also said that when she saw my ugly face just now, she thought I was blaming her for something. However, when we were in bed at night, my wife whispered and regretfully advised me to be patient and wait for a good opportunity to assert myself. "Are you crazy?" I retorted. "If I continue to do this, I will vomit blood! Am I a slave to be slaughtered by others?" A few days later, I tremblingly and proudly submitted my resignation to the foreigner.</p>
<p>After sitting idle at home for a month, watching my wife's worried face and listening to her complaints every day, I finally saw an advertisement in the newspaper for XX Business College seeking a typist. That day, I immediately went to a friend's house and used his typewriter to type an English job application and send it out.</p>
<p>I received a reply on the third day. The letter asked me to take an exam at 3:00 PM on Saturday. My wife and I were overjoyed.</p>
<p>Out of thirty male and four female applicants, I and two other males passed the exam. However, the school only wanted to hire one person, so they asked the three of us to take a second test on Sunday to determine the final hire.</p>
<p>I happily went home, and my wife encouraged me upon hearing the news. On Sunday, I went to my friend's house and practiced typing desperately. As a result, I typed more than one hundred and twenty words in ten minutes that day and ranked first. Immediately, a school worker led me to the president's office.</p>
<p>The president was a short, round-eyed man, wearing a black velvet otter collar overcoat, sitting in a chair in front of a desk near the door. Opposite him sat a young man in a Western suit, and next to the desk sat a young man in a cotton robe. They were probably secretaries or something. I stepped into the door, and the young man in the cotton robe told me to stand next to the president. Then the three of them questioned me like prosecutors.</p>
<p>"What is your name?" "Where are you from?" "Where have you worked before?" "Why aren't you working now?" "It's your own loss that you're not working." "Is a salary of forty yuan enough?" "You have to work at night here." "Why can't you?" "You have to work on holidays too." "You have to move here to live, so that you can have enough time to work." "But the cost of meals will be deducted from your wages." The president asked me many questions, and I answered them one by one. But when I heard that I had to work day and night without rest, all my joy sank! I said that working at night could be discussed, but I couldn't agree to working on Sundays.</p>
<p>"What do you have to do at night?" "Do you have things to do on Sundays too?" "Why don't you want to work on holidays?" This was asked by the young man in the suit. He simply treated me like an animal.</p>
<p>Finally, the president asked the two gentlemen if they had any other questions, and they both said it was fine. Finally, the president said to me, "Let us discuss it and notify you later. When you receive the letter, please fill in your resume in detail and find a guarantor to stamp it. Please wait three or four days."</p>
<p>In this way, I waited three or four days, a week, a month, but the letter that I never forgot in my dreams never came! Once, I met a young man on the road who had taken the second test with me. He said that he had gotten the job with a salary of twenty yuan!</p>

<h3 id="e15">How Should the Livelihood of Yarn Factory Workers Whose Work Has Been Reduced Be Maintained? <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>— Discussant: Councilor Qi</p>
<p>The "How Should the Livelihood of Yarn Factory Workers Whose Work Has Been Reduced Be Maintained?" proposed by Ms. Li Liumei in the last issue of this publication is indeed a serious issue.</p>
<p>In order to deepen the domestic economic panic, Japanese imperialism had no choice but to seek a way out for capitalism from the war against worker-dictatorship countries, the Soviet Union, and the partition of China. Similarly, in order to solve the unsolvable economic panic, capitalists have to place this burden on the shoulders of workers. The result of this work reduction will definitely be a further reduction in the already subhuman standard of living of the workers, a more severe implementation of "production rationalization," and the dismissal of large numbers of workers, creating countless new unemployed reserve armies. In today's China, there is no protection for workers, so to enable yarn factory workers to survive, the only way is to oppose work reduction and oppose wage reductions. But this is certainly not something that Ms. Li alone can do. Only by uniting together and using practical actions to resist the capitalists can the goal be achieved. In this process, the capitalists will definitely think of various methods to intimidate the workers or undermine their unity, but if the sisters all embrace righteousness, "share the blessings and share the hardships," then the final success will definitely belong to the workers. To give an example, if the capitalists say that they want to dismiss the workers who are leading this "trouble," everyone must be determined to "dismiss everyone if you dismiss anyone."</p>

<p>Time: April 5, 1933</p>
<p>Characters: A-Wang, his wife, his daughter, a female worker.</p>
<p>Location: A slum in Dapuqiao (At the opening, the wife lies on the bed with a pale face, and A-Wang stares blankly at the sick woman.)</p>
<p>Wang: Do you feel better now?</p>
<p>Wife: Still the same. I think: It's been seven or eight days since I went to work in the factory. I'm afraid the foreman will say something. I'll go to work in a few days when I feel better.</p>
<p>Wang: You can wait until you are better to go to work. If the foreman asks, A-Mao next door will tell him for you.</p>
<p>Wife: Look, the three of us can't work, but we have to eat. As the saying goes, "Sitting and eating will empty the mountain." We must find a way to earn some money.</p>
<p>Wang: Yes! Look, it's been raining for days without stopping, or else, I could have set up my stall and earned a few bucks.</p>
<p>Wife: You can't blame the weather, you can only blame our bad luck. You were working well in the tram company, but you were fired for striking. Although I wasn't fired, I got sick. I borrowed ten dollars from Li Mazi for leather ball money to do some small business, but in less than a month, it rained for several days, and half of the goods I bought got moldy, and the capital was slowly eaten away. Isn't this our bad luck?</p>
<p>Wang: If you didn't mention the usurious loan, I would have forgotten about it. It's already past three o'clock. Li Mazi is probably coming.</p>

<h3 id="e17">Female Shop Assistants in London <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Zhenhua</p>
<p>Female shop assistants are very popular in London, where there are female shop assistant schools and female shop assistant referral agencies. Almost every business employs female shop assistants, and some are entirely female. However, they are very careful about hiring female shop assistants. They must undergo strict examinations and physical examinations. Beauty is of course the most important thing, but eloquence and knowledge are also essential.</p>
<p>In Greater London, there are many large-scale department stores that pay great attention to female shop assistants. They must undergo training once a week, with a certain number of people designated as hypothetical customers and a certain number as shop assistants, practicing the attitude and reasonable answers they should have when selling goods. Every season, there is a game-like large training session. The methods are roughly divided into three types:</p>
<p>1.  Commodity Memory: This is to first divide all the shop assistants into two groups, and the instructor designates someone from one group to ask: "Where is such and such a commodity located?" and she randomly designates someone from the other group to answer. If she cannot answer, she loses. Then the loser asks the winner in turn: "Where is such and such a commodity located?" This is how they take turns asking questions.</p>
<p>2.  Showcase Display: This is when the instructor first designates someone to be in charge of the display, and the rest surround the showcase. After the display is completed, the others discuss whether it is beautiful. If someone thinks not, they come out to be in charge of the display and explain the reasons for it not being beautiful.</p>
<p>3.  Credit Practice: First, someone writes a page of hard-to-recognize goods names, place names, and buyer names. Whoever can discern it as such and such a word is the winner, and the winner then writes many goods names, etc., for the others to review and practice writing.</p>
<p>In addition, these companies also pay close attention to fashion issues. On the company's side, the designer first creates many styles, places them in the windows, and orders female shop assistants to wear various different fashions to lead the way, so that general female customers pay special attention to promote the company's business.</p>
<p>When customers enter the door, when they need to buy a certain commodity, the female shop assistant must immediately greet them with a smile and warmly serve them for the company. This is an essential condition for being a female shop assistant.</p>

<p>A certain gentleman wishes to hire a female copyist. She must be able to write quickly, copying more than 500 words in 10 minutes. It would be even better if she could translate telegrams. Working hours are from 7:00 AM to 8:00 AM and from 6:00 PM to 7:00 PM every morning. Those who are willing should send a letter to Mr. Xu Weili, No. 15, Lane 42, Jiaozhou Road.</p>
<p>Mr. Shen is now seeking a statistician to teach for one hour every night, with a monthly stipend of 15 yuan (appropriately increased for those who live far away). Those who wish to apply should briefly describe their experience and send a letter to Shen Wei, No. 7, Yexing Lane, Laiyi Wharf, Nanshi, this port.</p>
<p>A certain mansion plans to hire an English and arithmetic tutor to teach three young children for one hour a day. Those who are around 40 years old and can speak Cantonese are qualified. Those who wish to apply should send one letter in Chinese and one in English in their own handwriting to Mr. Bao, Pearl Theater, Fuxing Road intersection, Laobazi Road.</p>

<p>Wang: I'll discuss it with him again and give it to him tomorrow.</p>

<p>Wang: If the weather is good tomorrow, I'll set up my stall again and give him the money I sell.</p>
<p>Wife: What if it still rains tomorrow, or the business is bad?</p>

<p>— Shi Gongyu</p>
<p>My illness was getting better day by day, and my spirits were recovering day by day. My mother's happy expression was constantly showing on her wrinkled face, thinking that we could resume the life we used to consider extremely satisfactory.</p>
<p>After a week, my illness did indeed improve further, and I was able to pace back and forth in the tiny attic room. Feeling the boredom and suffering of being confined to bed for half a month, and driven by the need for bread, I said to my loving mother: "Mom, I have to go to the school today. I've been absent from my job for more than half a month!"</p>
<p>"A-Yu! Your body is not very healthy yet, I'm afraid..." she said tremblingly, as if she couldn't bear to be separated from me, "But since you are concerned about your job, then you must come back earlier."</p>
<p>I ran to the school anxiously, feeling melancholy along the way. "Yu!" A colleague saw me and couldn't speak for a moment, as if he had encountered a sad and angry event. "Brother Yu! I don't want to say it. Your fate is really bad! Go to the administrative office."</p>
<p>After hearing his words, I undoubtedly guessed eight points.</p>
<p>The head of the administrative office handed me "a letter, which read... "Proofreading is a very important responsibility and cannot be absent for a day. We have already hired someone else. If there is a vacancy in the future, we will definitely prepare a position..."</p>
<p>At this time, my thin bones could no longer support my body. Feelings of sadness and anger surrounded me, and I had to lower my head dejectedly and reluctantly run out of the school gate.</p>
<p>Back home, tears streamed down my face, and I couldn't say a word. My old mother, too, was stunned all day long, with tears streaming down her face, and had been somewhat numb recently. The grain is gone! The bag is empty! The mice have dug out everything! The sparrows have been netted clean! Alas! It is still like this now, so tomorrow will be even more...</p>
<p>I am good at calligraphy, writing, accounting, and proofreading, and can also write short political essays. I am now willing to do my best to serve society. I do not care about salary, but only ask to be able to provide for my parents, which is enough for me. Mailing address: No. 51, Penglai Road, Nanshi, this port.</p>

<h3 id="e21">Hollywood Martial Arts Star George Brent's Adventures in His Youth (Part 1) <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>— Xun Nan</p>
<p>George Brent doesn't talk about it much himself. Few people know that ten years ago, he was a strong member of the Irish independence movement, and he risked his life to engage in the secret work of the Independent Party. Although he was engaged in this secret work for only a little over a year, the average age of those who did his work before and after him was six weeks. Why? Because the British authorities were extremely strict with the Irish Independent Party, and once a party member was arrested, they were immediately shot, with no leniency. For example, the current president of the Irish Free State, Eamon de Valera, was also arrested several times, but the reason why he was not shot was because he was born in the United States and had American citizenship, so Britain did not shoot him to avoid American intervention. George Brent's ability to take on the secret work of the Independent Party for as long as a year also shows that he has superior courage. But George himself never mentions this to people, because he thinks it's not a big deal.</p>
<p>Let's first tell the story of George Brent's childhood. George was an orphan with both parents dead at the age of eleven. He had an older sister and an aunt living in New York. These two were his close relatives. Soon his sister took him away from his Irish homeland and went to New York in the United States to seek refuge with their aunt. George Brent entered school in New York, and because he was young, he soon lost his Irish hometown accent and replaced it with an American manner of speaking. This was his greatest advantage in engaging in the Irish independence movement later, because the British police detectives were deceived by him and considered him a real American.</p>
<p>George grew very fast. At the age of fourteen, he was already tall and big, like a twenty-year-old. By the time he was eighteen, people thought he was twenty-five years old, and his height had exceeded six feet. When he was eighteen years old, he graduated from New York High School and returned to Dublin, the capital of Ireland, to attend university. On the ship, he met a young Irish priest who was an enthusiastic member of the independence movement. During his conversation with George, he was moved by the priest and became a believer in the independence movement. However, because of the priest's introduction, George Brent began to feel infinite interest in drama. Later, at the University of Dublin, because of the revelation of his revolutionary enthusiasm, he openly clashed with a British professor. Fortunately, he had arranged in advance and signed a contract with a theater. So he dropped out of school on the pretext of engaging in theatrical life. Not long after, he joined the Independent Party and did active work, when he was not yet nineteen years old. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e22">Review of "Spring River Flower Moon Night" <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Nan</p>
<p>The entire play is very exciting</p>
<p>Transcends British Style</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Nanjing Theater hung up the "Sold Out" sign at 2:30 PM. Fortunately, I got a seat and finished watching "Spring River Flower Moon Night" TELL ME TONIGHT, and returned satisfied.</p>
<p>Before the main feature, there was a pure music film from Wufa Company, one thousand feet long. Throughout the entire film, a musical team of fifty people played music, with ups and downs, exceptionally pleasant to the ear.</p>
<p>When the main feature was performed, the song "Tell Me Tonight" was extraordinary, making people exclaim in admiration. Played from a radio station and broadcast to many people listening to the radio, they were intoxicated by the singing, "robbers entered the house without them knowing." Not only was it clever and lively, making people happy, but it also clearly introduced the protagonist's prestige and identity to the audience from the very beginning, making a deep impression. The director's ability was also deeply admired from the first act of the film. His skill is like this:</p>
<p>A singing king, long admired by people all over Europe, his female manager asked him to perform everywhere. He deeply resented the relentless harassment of the female manager, so he escaped midway. He met a silver-tongued con man and they hit it off, with the singing king appointing him as his secretary. When they arrived in a certain city, the mayor, reporters, and citizens all came to visit, which the singing king found unbearable, so he asked the new secretary to impersonate him and deal with them. He, however, went out alone and met a young lady, and they fell in love. Unexpectedly, the young lady was the mayor's daughter. At that time, the mayor was arresting the con man, but instead captured the real singing king. He had no choice but to use singing to prove his identity, and after being released, he had to go on stage. The female manager tracked him down, and the singing king tricked her into locking herself in a room, then ran out and married the mayor's daughter.</p>
<p>As for the various unreasonable things in the mayor's office, I will not criticize them, because singing comedies or humorous works should not have all artistic essence erased by reality, especially since it contains a lot of cool satire. Moreover, the insertion of songs is not at all awkward. The acting can be said to be distinct, and the transitions between scenes are even more divine. The lighting is well-balanced, and the photography is excellent. The novelty of the shooting technique can truly be said to be "a feast for the eyes, with beauty beyond compare." The sound is also very clear, and the music matches the rhythm of the actions. Each scene's continuity or sudden turns, the arrangement of characters' positions, hearing the sound before seeing the face, all have clever ideas that are unexpected.</p>
<p>The seven characters on the cast list each have their merits. Of course, the protagonist TANKIEPURA as the singing king is the best. Mayor's daughter MAGDASCHNCIDER performed very well, but there were too many good roles, so her special talents were not apparent. Con man SONNIEHALE is indeed a wonderful person, making people happy. Mayor EDMUNDGWENN and waiter AUBREYMATHER provided the most laughs, cool and humorous. Mayor's wife ATHENOSEYLER and female manager BETTYCHESTER also worked in different ways but achieved the same goal, adding significant color, and singing well.</p>
<p>British films have risen in status a lot since GOODNIGHTVEINNE was released, but after this production from Gaumont Company is shown, the British film industry will have even more to be proud of. Even "The Merry Widow" is probably less impressive compared to this?</p>

<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>The plot is far-fetched and superficial</p>
<p>The direction is immature and the acting childish</p>
<p>"The Lost Battalion," advertised with "Inscription of praise from important figures of the National Government" and "Movie stars sacrificing for art," premiered yesterday amidst our enthusiastic expectations. However, unfortunately, the result was the opposite. This is a film that is extremely disappointing.</p>
<p>Everyone should admit that in the current situation where the four northeastern provinces have been completely lost, only launching and intensifying a genuine revolutionary national war against Japan and imperialism is our only way out for China. Regarding this point, it is of course necessary to reflect it as much as possible in all departments of art, and further become a key link in completing this great work. However, "The Lost Battalion," produced under these circumstances, has not taken on its task. On the contrary, it explains this great national war with a narrow national concept, completely ignoring the important significance of anti-imperialism. What we see in "The Lost Battalion" is a disorganized and unplanned lost battalion sacrificing blindly, with childish combat. We think: if we really mobilize the masses to resist Japan in this way, then it is precisely promoting the destruction of the nation. As for the large part of the play that inserts trivial love affairs, and the vulgar and laughable so-called "emulating Yue Fei's loyalty to the country," it is of course also an exposure of the film's weaknesses. If we must find some relatively commendable points in it, then the fact that the reinforcements refused to provide assistance, to the point of letting the soliders die, can indeed remind us of the shameful situation of the "January 28th Incident."</p>
<p>The superficial and illogical plot is of course also a major point of the film's failure. If we want to point it out in summary, it is: (1) The "First Modern Mulan" (the cast list writes that Yang Liuqing, who has "sacrificed for art," is probably meant to be a memorial) does not appear at all in the play, but Zhao Renjie says that in addition to the first and second modern Mulans, there is also the first modern Mulan. (2) Zhao Renjie's mother suddenly dies without illness. (3) An officer says: "If there are no bullets, use hand grenades; if there are no hand grenades, use bayonets; if the bayonets break, use the rifle butt; if the rifle butt also breaks, use fists"; originally these are all tragic words, but in the plot they are very ridiculous. (In fact, many people laughed non-stop yesterday.) Of course, there are many others, but there is no need to list them all.</p>
<p>The above points are naturally the result of the screenwriter's lack of knowledge, but also the director's immaturity and incompetence. The war scenes are fake, which we can forgive under the actual circumstances of tight capital, but the confusion and disorder in the editing, and the failure to understand how to use the MONTEGE method, is a major shortcoming. The camera is also inflexible, but the composition of the scenes is barely satisfactory in a very small number of cases.</p>
<p>Regarding the acting, only the protagonist Min Dezhang is relatively lively, but his face is full of oil (which can help expression if used occasionally) and becomes annoying after seeing it for a long time. The others are bad and not worth mentioning.</p>
<p>The photographic technique, except for a few screens that are too blurry, can be considered an advantage of the film. The subtitles are unbearably vulgar.</p>
<p>However, these are not the places we must criticize. The main thing is that the meaning in the film is wrong.</p>

<p>In previous Hollywood film publications, praise for Constance Talmadge was frequently seen. Recently, Constance suddenly notified reporters from various magazines and newspapers, asking them not to mention Constance as a figure in the film industry in the future, so that everyone's minds would not retain the shadow of Constance. This person is willing to be a frugal housewife in society from now on, and no longer wants to be a ridiculous Hollywood figure.</p>
<p>Claudette Colbert now lives in the house that Greta Garbo used to live in. When Greta Garbo was in Hollywood, there was a room in this house that she never entered. The interior was decorated like a museum. After Claudette moved in, this museum remained in its previous state. It is said that Claudette has Garbo's habits.</p>
<p>Garbo lives on a small island by the sea in Sweden. She rented a house, using Greta Garbo's real name to rent the house. The landlord did not know this famous strange star, so he didn't pay attention. One day, a cinema on the island showed Garbo's film, and the landlord happened to go to see it. A tall and tranquil Garbo was shown on the screen. The landlord looked at it and it was her tenant. After listening to others talk about Garbo's reputation, he came from the theater, dragging his smiling head and shrugging his shoulders, and went back to flatter Garbo. The next day, Garbo fled, leaving without saying goodbye, leaving the landlord confused.</p>
<p>Russian star Anna Sten has contracted Marlene Dietrich's quirks. She wears men's clothes, dragging long trouser legs, and runs on the street. The children laugh, the adults watch, and Anna acts as if nothing happened. How fortunate Marlene is to have this comrade in men's clothing?</p>

<p>Produced by United Artists, directed by Bobbyk</p>
<p>Starring Mann, Beekford, Leslie Howard, etc.</p>
<p>Mary Monroe is immersed in love. This is strange to the extreme. Two weeks ago, she hadn't even dreamed of what love was. Two weeks ago, she hadn't seen that young John Carter. She was writing at her desk, about to write a sweet love letter to John. She raised her head and looked out the window at the garden full of elm shade; but she was infatuated and did not see the garden; what she saw was an avenue lined with trees, and she and her mother were sitting in a Victorian carriage; in front of them came a tall bicycle, ridden by a slender and handsome young man; that was John Carter. From then on, no matter where she was, she would see his graceful demeanor.</p>
<p>Mary first met John Carter in her father's office. Her father, William Monroe, was a large shipowner; a private banker; in that village in New England, he was the richest man. John Carter was just a clerk, an unimportant person. And William Monroe was an important person. Lord Harley of England wanted to marry his daughter and take her back to England.</p>
<p>A blush suddenly appeared on Mary's flower-like beautiful face. She frowned and her eyes returned to the letter she was writing. She quickly wrote a few more sentences, then signed her name; below she added a row of "kisses" (the symbol for KISSES); she put the letter to her cherry lips and kissed it several times. Dear John! She wearily and drowsily looked at the garden, where every night he would come to steal a moment of joy with her.</p>
<p>She did not intend to marry Lord Harley. She had long made this opinion clear to her parents, saying that she did not love him. But what she meant was not important. In mid-19th century New England, daughters had to obey their parents first, and were rarely able to make their own decisions freely. Mr. and Mrs. Monroe had agreed to marry Mary to Lord Harley. They considered this to be the best possible match.</p>
<p>Mary folded the letter, sealed it, and gave it to her trusted Aunt Susan. Her aunt took the letter and secretly ran to the bank, entrusting it to another colleague of John's, who then forwarded it to John. This was a very secret matter, which her father did not know at all. Mary was calculating at home the time when John received the letter, as if she could see with her own eyes John's joyful expression. She (To be continued)</p>
