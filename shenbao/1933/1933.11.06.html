<p>時評</p>
<h3>剿匪運動</h3>
<p>— 恒</p>
<p>匪患之在今日。尤甚於明末之流寇。於國家前途之關係。至深且巨。故當局有先安内而後攘外之申明也。夫明末張獻忠李自成輩起兵之初。僅迫於饑寒。嘯聚就食。旣無政治野心。更無與政府相頡頏之意。徒以當時爲政者宦官用事。因循貽誤。遂使流寇坐大。明社爲墟。而今之匪禍情勢。殊與以異。農村經濟。旣日漸衰頽。而新興之工業。又不能勝任轉換農業經濟而爲資本主義經濟之任務。城市不能消納農村間過剩之人口。内地交通阻滯。難於啓發城市工業。盡量輸出原料。吸收熟製貨品。於是凡重要城市。類皆爲舶來貨品之轉輸機關。形成吸取農村剩餘之地域。更益以人事之禍殃。天災之流行。過剩人口。别無出路。鋌而走險者多。乃成爲今日之現象。</p>
<p>贛省赤匪之亂。其結構内容。較諸明末張李。更爲複雜。政府近年來竭盡心力。以從事於剿平匪患。欲登斯民於袵席。奠定國家於平安。此固吾民之所切禱者也。况今日財政。困難已達極點。而又外患相乘强隣伺隙故匪若不平。則財政將愈陷苦境。一切建設敎育交通實業等。均將無從說起。而抵禦外侮。勢更等於空談。是剿匪實爲安内之急務。爲吾民所應深切注意充分認識者也。</p>
<p>孫中山先生臨終之際。懇切囑咐。謂欲達到完成革命之目的。「必須喚起民衆。」國民黨當政後。對於黨義之宣傳。未嘗不竭盡其力。但恐尙未深入民間。而一般人民亦如一盤散沙。因之政治困難愈甚。赤匪遂得利用一般社會之弱點。乘機而入。故今後之剿匪。當先喚起民衆對於國民黨之確切認識。團結一致此爲最要之點。</p>
<p>頃者大軍進剿勝利當然可期。惟於軍事問題告一段落之後。尤須注意於地方秩序之恢復。民間業務之再生。而其要則在於政治之建設。與經濟組織之樹立。僅祇軍事勝利。似尙未能謂爲已竟全功也。蓋今日中國。即無赤匪爲禍之地區人民亦感生活之痛苦。故政治修明。爲舉國上下之所切望。特匪區及接近匪區者更迫切耳。政府於此。應審度時勢。權其緩急。量其輕重。因當地人民之需要。使地方政治。在軍事一過。即能樹立楷模。必官皆廉潔有爲。乃能確保軍事上旣得之勝利。經濟建設。尤須次第着手。而後民乃得而安其所業。不致再爲赤匪所乘也。匪之所以鼓疊民衆。擾亂社會者。端在利用此過渡時期中經濟的衰落所引起之生活不安。挑播一般人愤恨之徧狹心理。故能繼續撑持至今。重勞師旅以伸討伐。竊以爲掃平土匪不難。而難於勦匪後政治建設與經濟復興耳。</p>
<p>現在民智日漸發達。物質上之引誘亦見盛旺。農村破敗。則種種不祥之暗示隨以發生。設使不能爲釜底抽薪之計。絶其根株。則勦匪之軍事勝利。仍恐不易保持。故於勦匪開始之際。深願政府多致力於政治問題之解决。尤須解除匪區内人民之困苦。培養民力。使其不再爲匪所惑。而并能出力禦匪。然後剿匪之功可以不朽。而民衆乃得安居樂業矣。</p>
<h3>日俄戰雲籠罩哈爾濱人心浮動　　居民相率他徙瀋長亦呈不安　　日機深夜演習　　軍隊續向北開</h3>
<p>（哈爾濱）日俄戰爭之說、已令此間人心惶惶、一部份居民均售其所有相率他徙、瀋陽及長春兩地亦有同樣之趨勢、但不若哈市之甚耳、至於人心不安之最大原因、爲邇來日本飛機時作深夜演習、日軍之向北滿開動、及中東路爭執之無法解决、雖日當局一再否認謡言之無稽、但哈市之</p>
<p>恐慌有增無减、致令日軍事當局不得不正式發表聲明、略謂北開之軍隊、全係爲剿匪之用、關於俄方之備戰、該項聲明中稱、俄方雖已在遠東邊境集中若干軍隊及飛機數百架、且在</p>
<p>邊境增築砲壘、但此不能謂係俄方侵略「滿洲國」之凖備、因蘇俄現正傾其全力以完成其五年計劃、故蘇俄非僅對遠東採取和平政策、且對其他方面亦抱此同樣政策也、至於「滿洲國」僅欲在中東路有平等之管理權、以防今後再有其他不法事件、如將中東路車輛撤入俄境事發生、「滿洲國」僅欲維持彼等之權利、其進行之步驟、亦以「滿洲國」法律爲根據、並非若俄方所謂擬以</p>
<p>暴力强攫東路爲已有也、蘇俄人員爲喚起俄民之勇氣起見、乃故意盛傳日俄戰爭必將爆發、而勝利終歸俄方</p>
<p>此種政策、已令日俄「滿」三國人民感覺目前之環境、已與一九二九年中俄戰事爆發前之情形相同、但日俄「滿」三國現正各盡其力、以發展本國之經濟、故戰事發生之說、實無理由、日俄對於彼此間之政策、確有互相猜疑之處、但如俄方有危及「滿洲國」和平之行動時、則日本爲盡日「滿」恊約之義務起見將被逼</p>

<h3>張驤伍談長山八島狀况　　從接收經過到施政方針　　島民安居樂業鷄犬無驚</h3>
<p>濟南通信、長山八島屬山東蓬萊縣、前爲東北海軍根據地、日前省府主席韓復榘出巡膠東、以該島爲海軍門户、關係魯省海防至爲重要、特委山東第五路民團指揮張驤伍、兼領八島行政長官、記者於十月中旬、前往該島作實地視察、由蓬萊縣買舟北進、經一句鐘抵長山鳥、卽長山八島特區行政專員公署所在地、亦君島中最大之一島、其中新建築頗多、尙岸開闢馬路、遠望廟島砣磯島羅列海中、風帆沙島、水光接天、風景絶佳、沿途民衆、安居樂業、桑麻鷄犬、大有世外桃源之槪記者登陸後、卽赴公署訪行政專員張驤伍、承張詳談關於接收組織經過及今後施政方針、紀錄如下、</p>
<h3>組織公署</h3>
<p>張氏云、本人奉命兼理八島行政、愧非政治專家、深恐有負民衆所望、際此外患日急、時事多艱、惟有本諸良心血性、與民更始、八島前歸海軍接轄時、一切設施、採取放任主義、所有興革事宜、均歸各社社長主持、究其原因、公署職員、多數由海軍司令部調來兼職、兼籌並顧、諸感困難、故對於八島一切行政設施、不得不委於各社社長、本人對此放任政策、深爲不滿、竊思從政帶兵、事出一轍、不愼於始、鮮克有終、若不於此時力挽狂瀾、使之西倒、何以實現法政精神、以慰民望、故毅然决然第一步組織健全公署、收回治權、期有行政統一之日、至於公署組織、因本人兼任第五路指揮、不能常川駐島、特設主任一、總務科一、敎育科一、直轄公安局一、因限於經費、未便擴大範圍、</p>
<h3>敎育一斑</h3>
<p>八島孤立海中、文化落伍、欲謀開啟民智、必施相當敎育、敎育之發展、全視經費爲轉移、前此八島敎育經費、每年約計三萬餘元、係由八島十三社臨時攤派　以敎育會爲管理經費機關、旣無法定欵項、又無相當保障、故攤派經費時、動感困難、敎育會毫無補救辦法、統計八島敎育機關、有兩級小學校六、初級小學校二十二、女學校五、蠶絲女學校一、男女學生共三千餘名、莘莘學子、每因學校經費無着、動輒輟學、殊堪痛心、本人爲八島敎育計、爲國家前途計、皆負有重大責任、故將敎育會改爲公署敎育科、藉以隨時督責、用期日起有功、現已積極計劃、將八島地方團體固家收入、劃歸敎育費項下、力謀敎育費之獨立、以完成發展八島敎育之重大使命、</p>
<h3>治安維持</h3>
<p>八島爲渤海口門户、關係海防、至關重要、八島治安、除公安局負責維持外、復調第五路民團軍及手槍隊、　配各島、恊助維持、就目前觀察、八島治安、確有把握、</p>
<h3>交通聯絡</h3>
<p>因八島散處海中、不相連屬、交通深感不便、對於海防警備、漁業保護尤感困難、現擬由公署購置汽船一艘、一便公署辦公、二便來往民衆、務使八島聯爲一氣、使各島各社、不發生任何隔閡、守望相助、呼應相通、</p>
<h3>建設計畫</h3>
<p>八島財力有限、建設綦難、現擬官民合作、就可能範圍、作必要之建設、現經認爲必需積極進行者、有下列三項、（一）修築各島環島馬路、及十字形馬路、（二）鑿井、（三）種樹、</p>
<h3>海産豐富</h3>
<p>八島土地、不宜耕種、農産方面、毫無紀載價值、島中人民業漁業者、十居八九、海産之富、頗負盛名、尤以海參·魚翅·鮑魚·干貝·淡菜·紫菜·爲出産大宗、惜製造及保存、未得其法、殊爲浩歎、現擬指導商民、合資設立海産罐頭公司、藉以保存原質、銷售各地、亦可稍塞漏𢨴、</p>
<h3>行政範圍</h3>
<p>本署所轄八島、計有南長山島北長山島·廟島·小黑山島砣磯島·大小欽島·南北城隍島、以上八島、仍照原日劃爲十三社、南長山島有西山社·東山社·連城社·南城社·北長山島有北城社·北店子社、廟島有廟島社、大黑山島有南莊社·北莊社、小黑山島有小黑山社、砣磯島有砣磯社、大小钦島有欽島社、南北隍城島有隍城社、以上十三社、原各設社長一人、副社長一人、現擬改爲區分制、改社爲一區、每區設區長一人、以符行政法令、用收統一之效云云、</p>

<h3>孫氏談片</h3>
<p>記者晤孫、首詢以張李借訪所談結果、與庽港胡展堂先生近况、據答張李二先生、本晨來晤、蓋昨余到滬後曾去謁見、今其來會、不過對中國大局與各部問題、稍有晤談、全無關大要　胡先生在粤、其個人近狀、未悉確切、由他人傳說、謂胡先生態度、確較諸以前稍爲緩和、卒以其本人近無如何意見發表、故亦難測其實與不實、總之、國難若是嚴重、吾人唯有相互團結、攘外固先安内、但安内亦非團結不可、此刻楊德昭先生蒞止、因其擬於日内有粤省之行、故特邀來談談云云、</p>
<h3>楊德昭談</h3>

<h3>海軍江鳳號機昨被雨阻南通　　電告午後返滬但至晚未到　　預料須俟天晴後再行返滬</h3>

<h3>棉業統委會注意植棉紡織　　全國棉田年見增加　　紗廠衰落亟待救濟</h3>
<p>中央社云、全國經濟委員會棉業統制委員會、自成立於茲、行將匝月、對於棉種之改良、及棉價慘跌之救濟等、均已分頭進行、改良棉種、則注意於各地棉花種植近况、該會已派棉業專家孫恩麘·等、分赴各地考察、以作改良棉種之參考、茲據中央社記者探悉各情如次、</p>
<h3>各省棉田年有激增</h3>
<p>全國産棉區域、以江蘇·湖北·河北·爲最多、山東·河南·陜西·山西·浙江·安徽·湖南·江西·等省次之、歷年均有調查、最近本年度第二次調查、共有棉田三千九百六十八萬四千三百六十九畝、棉産計九百八十三萬八千二百八十六担、本年第一次調查、則爲三千九百十五萬七千四百四十六畝、産額爲一千零七十三萬四千四百五十一担、又悉二十年度調查、總計爲三千一百六十三萬七千七百七十九畝、六百三十九萬九千七百八十担、去年度調查、總計爲三千七百零九萬九千八百畝、八百十萬五千六百三十七担、棉田産額、年見增加、</p>
<h3>棉農種植必須改良</h3>
<p>棉田産額之多寡、當然與種植之改良有關、但天時風水、影響亦鉅、本年度第一次産額、平均每畝産皮棉二十七斤强、如雨水適時、可增至三十斤以上、各省棉産現狀、以山西省進步爲最速、全國棉田面積甚大、如種植等加以改良、則産額增加、不必再仰給於外貨、棉業專家、此次奉命分赴各地考察、認爲各地種棉、都墨守舊法、而棉本之低矮、棉鈴之微小、實爲産額不能十分增加之惟一原因、</p>
<h3>救濟棉價首先調查</h3>
<p>棉業統制委員會、深恐以前所調查全國棉田等、或有遺漏、故决定於最近期内以詳確之調查、如棉田及産額二項外、廢田荒地之數量、各地棉商字號、以及種棉農民之生活等、亦將詳加調查、至於近來市上棉價慘跌之救濟辦法、則非有完備之計劃、殊難見效、收買大批棉花、藉求提高棉價、則非根本辦法云、</p>
<p>近年來我國外受世界經濟恐慌之影響、内因農村經濟之衰落、以致百業衰落、而紡業一業、幾瀕破産、但日本在滬之紗織業、因得該國政府之經濟援助、仍能維持營業、因之我國紗廠、益感不支、茲將我國紗織業近况及日商在華情形、分誌如次、</p>
<h3>最近中日廠商情形</h3>
<p>我國紡織一業、自清季購機製造後、至歐戰時始大興盛、初僅數十萬錠、後增至一百餘萬錠、蓋其時各國正移其生産力量、從於軍械之製造、致來源斷絶、供過於求、紡織業遂日漸發達、而日本在滬之紗織廠、亦與我並駕齊驅、故今日上海一埠、日本有紗錠一百二十五萬餘枚、而我國則祇有一萬零六萬餘枚、在滬紗廠、國人自營者二十八家、日商三十家、故本市紡織業、幾有被日商把持之勢、</p>
<h3>日紗得佔優勢原因</h3>
<p>至華廠日廠營業差異之原因、（一）我國紗廠多係股份有限公司性質、股息年需一分左右、而日廠則大半由其本國紗廠來華分設、即由其本廠之盈餘項下撥欵經營、其官利極微、（二）我國主辦紗廠者、從前大半缺乏專門學識與經騐、是以組織及管理方面、實不及日廠之完備、（三）我國紗廠原料、就地向外商訂購、顔色拉力等時有變更、致出品不良、日商則派有專員駐美購辦原料、選定一種、永久不變、故出口精良、易於銷售、</p>
<h3>棉統會將從事救濟</h3>
<p>日廠之最佔優勢者、爲持有該國政府之輔助與維持、自九一八及一二八戰事發生後、在華日商、因受我國抵貨運動、虧折不支、乃由該國政府撥欵救濟我國不然、故全國經濟委員會棉業統制委員會、有鑒於斯、决將著手救濟全國紗廠業之衰落云、</p>
<h3>馬衡談騐收故宮古物經過　　今日入京即行北返　　古物一時不遷回平</h3>
<p>故宮博物院院長馬衡、於本月二日到滬、辦理故宮古物交替事宜、中央社記者昨日特往訪馬氏於其旅邸、當承接見、據談騐收情形如下、</p>
<h3>辦理移交完畢</h3>
<p>據馬氏談、此次來滬、實爲辦理移交事宜、前院長易培基氏已將一部份移交手續、與本人辦理清楚、惟僅係初步之移交、不過文書庶務會計秘書等部份而已、至於故宮古物之抽查、僅抽查其一部份、尙未完全蕆事也、中央所派監盤委員北平市長袁良之代表許家瀚氏、在塲監視已畢、渠擬於今日（按卽昨日）北返、</p>
<h3>尙待繼續檢查</h3>
<p>記者旋詢以此次古物檢查、是否完竣、無須再待檢視、馬答古物之移交、責任重大、與普通行政機關辦理移交絶對不同、普通行政機關、只須一月、最多二月、卽可點檢完畢、本院如此多之貴重物件、非短時期内可了事、本人此次在京、已與汪院長談及、擬將此案另行辦理、不久、或將有二次檢視、以昭鄭重、否則草草了事、如有差訛、將不知責任誰屬、汪院長並擬於下次檢點時、由行政院縳請監察院派委員二人蒞平滬兩方面實行點騐、惟時間尙未决定耳、</p>
<h3>到滬未見記者</h3>
<p>馬氏又謂、本人此次到滬、並未接見其他記者、四日某報所載各節、實可詫異、故致有前易院長之更正、本人實毫無聞知、本人不能負任何責任、</p>
<h3>今日首途北返</h3>
<p>記者旋詢馬氏何時離滬、據稱、明日（卽今日）卽首途赴京、在京稍事躭擱、卽行北返、不再來滬下次點騐、卽由在滬周莊二科長負責辦理、本人無再來滬之必要云、</p>
<h3>古物遷平不確</h3>
<p>日前報載故宮古物存滬、用費太大、擬卽運回北平云云、亦非確詞故宮理事會並未開會討論此事、古物倐爾遷來、倐爾遷返、其用度當亦不貲、故政府方面、一時亦不致將古物遷回北平也、</p>
<h3>救國軍代表蒞滬　　向有關係方面報告軍况</h3>
<p>吉林救國軍王德林孔憲榮部之代表楊勛臣、昨自前方來滬、向有關係方面報告軍事近况、及寒衣缺乏情形、大致爲（一）沙河敗敵、九月二十三日、日軍由五站派出大批軍隊、擬來襲我督戰司令張禹部之根據地、當被我偵悉、立派張明九團長、率隊至沙河地方堵截、激戰一晝夜、敵漸退往中東路線、我乘勝追擊、俘擄十餘名、俘獲槍械子彈尤多、（二）攻一面坡、本軍兩次攻擊東寗未得手、擬暫向西部發展、擬破壞一面坡老爺嶺之中東鐵路、阻止日軍前進爲目的、刻已與東南西南兩路司令聯絡一起、即將會攻一面坡後、再合力向南開展、圖佔吉垣、（三）巡視防地、副司令孔憲榮、九月底抵東省、即分别巡視各防地、現已視畢、駐節⼝⼝、連日正與諸將領會商整頓部屬、及收復失地計劃、惟東北嚴寒、天已降雪、三軍衣乏挾鑛、尤望各界接濟寒衣、</p>

<h3>柏林中國美術展覽會籌備經過</h3>
<p>昨日記者走訪敎育部某負責人、詢問柏林中國美術展覽會籌備經過情形、據其答覆如下、</p>
<p>近年來、日本人常挾其未成熟之東洋畫、常赴歐洲各大國宣傳、儼然以代表東亞藝術自居、二十年一月、日本政府以八萬碼克之資助、與帝國美術院名義、在柏林普魯士美術院開一大規模之現代畫展覽會、並將畫品運往德國各重要市鎭展覽竟使全德人士、嘖嘖稱羨、以爲日本美術、可以代表東方、幸德人中研究東方藝術者、亦不乏人、對於中國美術、亦能賞識、曾自動開中國美術展覽會一次、將中國古畫古銅器古雕刻玉器磁器剌繡等、陳列月餘、頗能聲動一時、惜微集倉卒、内容不甚充足、德人引爲憾事、屬向中國駐德使館詢問、以爲若得中國政府及敎育界藝術界提倡贊助、德人深願再開一次中國展覽會、以新德國藝術界耳目、於是德國佛郎府中國學院、遂於二十年三月、發起開一中國美術展覽會、參觀人數極多、連日絡繹不絶、惟佛郎府雖爲大城市之一、然究不如首都之重要、未足以盡宣揚中國美術之能事、我國駐德使館、乃與德國藝術界及政事各界領袖、恊定於二十三年二月、舉行一次大規模之中國近代畫展覽會於柏林之普魯士美術院、並决定由中德兩國人士、共同組織一籌備委員會、籌備一切、德方由德國東亞美術恊會主持、華方由中央研究院主持、此舉行柏林中國美術展覽會之發動情形也、</p>
<p>籌備委員會中、德方之委員爲德國東亞美術恊會會長沙爾武博士、（Dr·WilhelmSolf）德國東亞美術恊會副會長克倫記博士、（Dr·JngHerbertVonKlemperer）德國東亞博物館館長克爾滿博士、（Dr·EttoKummel）德國東亞美術恊會會計主任銀思伯博士（Dr·HerbertGinsberg）副主任海歐德博士、（Dr·EduardFreihereVonderHeydt）國立美術博物館館長克拉愁博士、（Dr·CurtGlaser)及德國外交部代表等、中國方面之委員、經二十一年六月行政院第四十二次會議决定、聘敎育部部長、中央研究院院長、北平研究院院長、駐德公使、及陳樹人·葉恭綽·劉海粟·高奇峯·徐悲鴻等、至十一月經行政院七十四次會議、又加聘王一亭·張道藩·齊白石·林風眠·林文錚·狄平子·張澤等七人爲籌備委員、是年八月六日、我方籌備委員會、在上海開第一次會議當經决議、於是日成立籌備處、籌備處即附設在上海亞爾培路三三一號中央研究院出版品國際交換處内、並推蔡元培葉恭綽陳樹人徐悲鴻劉海粟爲常務委員、以蔡元培爲主席、開始籌備一切、此組織籌備委員會之經過情形也、</p>

<h3>闖禍</h3>
<p>— 拾玖</p>
<p>闖禍這回事，自大人以至小孩，都會幹一下子的；不過所闖的禍，其性質有大有小，其動機有心的與無心的種種不同而已。按闖禍二字，雖似未曾見過經傳；然證以「小東人闖下了滔天大禍，」把老薛保嚇得「向三娘雙膝跪落，」則禍之不可闖也亦可知。原小東人所以敢於闖禍，敢於闖大禍，敢於闖滔天大禍，自有其背景在。這背景是很明顯的。假使老薛保平時不把他的小東人當作寳貝似的，那末他｜小東人｜那有這種膽量，敢與三娘作難？所以照春秋責備賢者之例，小東人闖禍，究竟是有心還是無心，雖不必去深考它，且亦無庸去深考它；然老薛保總不能辭其咎。迄於今，一輩善於闖禍的朋友抱了「一不做，二不休」主義，索性把那禍闖得大些，横直到那其間，總有像老薛保之流出來做好做歹，把那禍事收拾起來。這想是效法小東人之所爲罷。所可憐的是『三娘』坤綱從此不能再振了。</p>
<p>翻開西游記一看，猪八戒會闖禍的，孫行者亦會闖禍的。然闖禍的手段，孫行者比猪八戒高得多；並且他的闖禍，總是有野心的。他敢於大鬧天宮，幾乎弄得玉皇大帝束手無策。這個禍闖得還了得！其次，他敢於在如來佛手掌心裏大撒爛污。這個禍闖得又大不大？但其結果是怎樣呢？自然看過西游記的，都能相視而笑，莫逆於心，也不必我來多說。唐僧亦幸而有緊箍咒，不然，他恐亦將如三娘一般，祗好假痴假呆了。我羨唐僧，我惜三娘。</p>

<p>我們在馬路上走着，總見着有些人，穿了藍布短衫褲，密排的紐扣，當胸敞開，一個也不扣牢。我們一望而知··這不是勞動的工人；一定是起碼的白相人。因爲縉紳先生與夫商店夥計，任你窮得夜飯米都没有，一件長褂子，或是一套羅宋西裝，斷乎其不肯少。所以這藍布短衫褲，便是這兩種人的特别製服了。工人穿這藍布短衫褲，實在大有理由。因爲他們一天到晚的工作，汗水淋漓，塵灰撲面，那裏好穿淡色的衣服。這藍布一是堅牢經穿；二是色深耐污，所以再合宜也没有的了。至於白相人喜穿藍布衫褲，我倒没有研究過，或許是價賤耐穿的緣故吧。</p>
<p>有位朋友告訴我說··北地上的江湖英雄，大都喜穿藍布衫褲的。因爲青紗帳起。他們正是獻好身手的機會。藍色的衣服，躱在碧綠的葉叢裏，誰也難以找覓。所以和官軍對抗起來，可以減少敵人攻擊的目標，常常會佔優勝的。唔！我明白來｜上海近來有一種藍衫黨，專幹攔路打刦的勾當，｜｜俗呌做剥猪玀｜｜前幾天本埠各報都登載過，原來他們是學北方健兒的樣呀。不過上海是牛山濯濯，路無寸草，陣上失風起來，四面探捕兜拿，實在無從躱避，未免辜負你所穿的藍衫吧。</p>
<p>說到藍衫，我想起從前的士子，都是穿藍衫的。等到考中了進士，金殿封官，才有穿紅袍的資格。故從前祝賀讀書人，總有「脫却藍衫換紅袍」一語。不過這一句祝語，現在用還用得着，而意義却太不相同，舉幾個例在下面··</p>
<p>有一位老先生，到湘贛邊界去游歷回來，人家問他社會狀况怎樣？他只說一句話道··「脫却藍衫換紅袍」。起先人家不懂，後來赤匪起事，纔知道他說所有的農工已經赤化了。</p>
<p>在機器間當學徒的小三子，他因受不住苦，丢了工匠不幹，去當一名清道夫。每天穿着紅布馬甲，在馬路上掃垃圾，我說··這也是「脫却藍衫換紅袍」呀！</p>
<p>末了，我還要奉勸無産階級的人們，做件藍布大褂穿穿。因爲你穿不起國貨呢絨的洋裝；又穿不起甚麽綢甚麽緞的袍子，還是穿件布衣的好。一來是担倡國貨；二來是儉樸可風，得了這些美名，實際上還可以省錢。不過你切不可省之又省，改穿藍布短衫褲，因爲人們一定疑惑你蹩了脚，現在的時勢，究竟免不掉「只重衣衫不重人」呀！</p>
<p>甜酸苦辣</p>
<h3>夫婦之道</h3>
<p>— 沈瘦若</p>
<p>常人都說夫婦之道苦矣！不佞以爲此道不僅苦也，更有甜酸辣之味在焉。試舉如下，願具有夫婦資格之同志一回味之。</p>
<p>（一）新婚蜜月，形影不離，情話喁喁，温柔鄕好。夫婦之道甜矣！</p>
<p>（二）愛情以日久而漸淡，所天或另結其新歡，房帳岑寂，醋意横生；醋海之波，從茲而起。夫婦之道酸矣！</p>
<p>（三）由嫉妬而發生裂痕，由裂痕而宣言離異；或請律師作證，或訴法庭公斷；精神經濟，兩受犧牲。夫婦之道苦矣！</p>
<p>（四）不生嫉妬，不閙離婚，而家庭雖小，子女特蕃，旣感撫養之維艱，復病孶生之不已；惟有眼中出火，鼻孔生烟。夫婦之道辣矣！</p>

<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第十八回脈脈傳茶含悲慰夫婚　　怱怱出塞强笑别家人</p>
<p>桂枝却以爲他是捨不得打碎了東西，立刻搶上前去，將茶杯搶了過來，放在茶几上，笑道··就是打碎了一個茶杯，那也很不值什麽，你爲什麽捨不得放手？趙自强這才站定了，笑道··我們當兵的人，身上掛了彩，算是一種榮耀，端了槍在手上，依然是幹。若是潑了一點𤍠茶在手背上，就把杯子摔了，這也顯得我太無用啦。桂枝站在那茶几面前，就彎了腰向他手上看了看，笑道··還好，燙得不怎樣的厲害。他看完了，將腰一伸，人就向後一退。不料就是這樣的一退把茶几碰着。茶几轉了兩轉，不曾站穏，那茶杯不會黏住茶几面，落到地上，嗆唧一嚮，跌了個粉碎。桂枝回轉身來，笑道··你瞧，你要保留，還是没有保留住，把你的手白白的燙了一陣。他說了這話，並不怎樣的在意，依然彎了腰去拾起那些碎片來。趙自强臉上，早就是紅一陣白一陣，心裏更撲撲亂跳。及至桂枝將碎碗片檢起，扔到門外邊去了，他回轉來的臉色，却是依然穏靜像平常一樣的，趙自强自己才止定了顔色，向他笑道··什麽事都是注定。這一隻茶杯注定了是要打碎的。你瞧，到了還是砸碎了。桂枝笑道··所以　，我命裏注定了是軍人······說到了這裏，他的聲音，就很細微了，於是接着笑道··到了總是丘八，趙自强覺得他雖是一句玩笑的話，然而這一句話，可直扎了自己的心窩，臉上早是血漲得紅中帶紫，只把鼻子兩邊的斜紋印出深深的道子來，顯出了他是在窘迫中發出來的一番苦笑。桂枝這倒摸不着頭腦，自己打碎了碗，爲什麽未婚夫却是這樣子找急呢？他因爲趙自强是個性子直率的人，而且有些新思想的人，决不會爲了打碎一隻茶杯，認是一種不祥的預兆的。（二三二）</p>
<p>婦女的樂園</p>
<h3>食物的常識　　食物的消化時間</h3>
<p>— 楚玉</p>
<p>我們天天所吃的東西，究竟那一種是容易消化，那一種是不容易消化的，主婦們應當要有常識。現在我把人體中吸收的主要成分，簡單的說明如下。一，以蛋白質爲主要成分的食物，就一·０００格蘭姆的分量，在胃中消化的時間？如半熟的鷄蛋｜｜（把蛋打散，用開水冲食，或把整個的蛋，用開水泡到半熟，）要一點卅分鐘，生的雞蛋，要二點三十分，燉牛肉要三點十分，西洋大菜的所謂牛排，要四點十五分，煎蛋要三點十五分，猪肉（紅燉四點三十分，嫰炒肉片，四點十五分，）清蒸魚三點三十分，油灼魚三點五十分。若把鳥肉獸肉魚肉三者比較起來，魚肉消化最快，鳥肉次之，獸肉最慢。至於含水炭素中的主要成分食物，麥類要一點四十分，米飯二點十五分，糕餅要兩點半，粟米與玉蜀黍兩點半，麵包兩點十分，大餅三點，蒸甘藷三點鐘。</p>
<h3>食物與身體必要的原素</h3>
<p>秋冬的季節，爲一年中食慾最旺盛時候，若是調養得適宜，身體容易肥胖，要特别注意日常食物，而食物中最要的，一，爲構成筋肉的食物，（蛋白質）就是要得到吸收多含窒素的食物，（如魚類，豆類，豆腐，花生，豆腐皮等）二，爲身體内加𤍠的食物，以多吃含有澱粉的食物（如米，馬铃薯，麥，麵包，餅乾，糕，餅等）三，若要腦與神經健全發達，那要吃些含有燐質的東西。（如魚，蝦，兎肉等）四，若要增加活力素，可吃些海草，與海産的魚類，（如缺少活力素時，那身體内的甲狀腺肥大，就發生病症了。五，要骨骼有營養分，應吃些牛乳，雞蛋，青菜類的根莖等（骨骼内如缺少營養分，就要發生結核病，）其他維他命爲身體發育上必不可少的要素，維他命Ａ最富的食物，爲牛奶油，魚肝油，牛肉，魚類，人乳，馬鈴薯，雞蛋，黍，蔬菜等。維他命Ｂ最多的爲糙米，小麥，蛋，糖，牛乳，青菜等，維他命Ｃ最多的，爲濘檬，橘，蘋果，蔬菜等。我們日常所得的營養素，維持生命，保護健康，促進發育，都靠上面所說各種原素的力。簡單的說起來，含水炭素爲活力素的源泉，譬如我們終日活動，消耗了不少的活力素，應當吃些植物性的食物，就是要多得澱粉，纖維素等東西，蛋白質爲補充身體内消耗的物質，構成身體的組織，脂肪一部爲發生活力素，一部是藏於皮下組織與其他體内，補育消耗物質構成體内組織，無機鹽類爲補充體内無機物質，調和生活機能。他如水的供給，尤爲重要，普通因爲體内水分缺少就發生了消化不良病，譬如舌頭乾燥，神經亢奮的表現，况且我們身體内，約占三分之二的水分，水在身體内，如同機器的油一樣的，所以我們平常的食物，應當顧到各種營養素，那末，身體就不會衰弱了，若是偏重那一種營養素，就要發生缺乏原素的病態，所以主持家政的婦女們，應當特别注意食物。外國人常常說我們中國人没有常識，不知衛生，這就指每天所食的東西，都不知道有利有害而說的。</p>

<h3>上海市近十年來醫藥鳥瞰（續）</h3>
<p>— 龐京周</p>
<p>醫藥刋物。一言以蔽之曰「上海特多而不統一的。」其原因是著作者少聯絡。而出版著作的責任。全爲醫藥界自己所負的緣故。若要解决這個問題。只有兩個途徑。第一是醫藥學會大團結。由會中負起出版推銷的責任來。然後廣羅會員中的執筆者。加以地理上的支配。如此非但上海一埠解决。即就是全國。也許一并得到調劑。第二個辦法。是把出版的權。完全讓與出版界｜｜書賈。（按外國如此辦法者甚多。）使出版部份有較大的經濟力量。並且於招攬廣告。推銷雜誌。另發揮一種專長。而各項稿件。簡直付給稿費。編纂人員。简直重薪聘任。一定可以很有成績。而且此法。比了待醫學會大團結。還較易實現。只是目前的出版界。還没有將眼光。放到醫藥雜誌上罷了。依我計算。即就滬寗滬杭兩路上的三十餘種刋物看起來。所收廣告費總額。已不在小處。銷數合計。也略有可觀。而况合併之後。稿件豐富。自可改爲星期刋。而增收廣告代價。故此確是出版界已經值得做的賣買了。</p>
<p>我最初作這篇文字的動機。旨在把上海市醫藥界一切混亂倚形。偏係不匀的態度。約略描寫一下。來引起社會人士的注意。以便從事督促改進。不想落筆以來。閒話越說越多。不說又欠醒豁。到底牽枝帶葉。惹動了許多問題。恐怕讀者久嫌沉悶。所以不得不急於結束。至於我所述的那些辦法。原呌作區區一得之愚。本來未必盡當。而况醫藥界經濟上的偏倚不匀。莫說中國爲然。就是美國那種國家。也正鬧着「有錢的化費太多」。「貧苦的人民還有百分之三十八没有得到良好的治療」呢。所以他們有個委員會。研究全美醫藥經濟的支配。已工作了五年之久。上海雖則一埠。也决不是三言兩語和一半天可以提出完善的辦法來的。倘能得社會有心人。大家分一部份腦力在上頭。羣起謀全市市民的幸福。那就是作者作馨香禱祝的了。</p>
<p>這一篇談話式的文字。本來是以耳聞目擊憶記所得的事爲本。所以並没有用什麽參考品。不過對於醫師，醫院，醫政，等項。却從衛生局各案。醫事彙刋醫界指南中得到許多助力。而類乎我的論調。和可以同我這文字參照的作品。在過去與本文陸續披露的時期中間。也有許多發表過。如今摘錄原題著者以及出處。都二十四種附錄在人下面。</p>

<h3>提倡公共衛生與改進貧民生活</h3>
<p>— 宋國賓</p>
<p>關於怎樣的提倡公共衛生這一類的文字，在現在的中國，似乎是鬧得很起勁，但是空話儘管說得高興，而實際上的成績，則微乎其微。我們要提倡公共衛生，應當消除阻礙衛生的現象，要預防傳染，就應該滅絶傳染病構造的源泉。不知道病因，而亂投方藥，病因然不會好而反要别生枝節的，頭痛醫頭，脚痛醫脚，雖然可以安靜一時，結果是仍然要復發的。提倡公共衛生的朋友們，千萬要抓住這「對症發藥」四個字。</p>
<p>我以爲要提倡公共衛生，要滅絶傳染病的傳染，根本的救濟方法，是没有比改進貧民生活再重要的了！假使不信，我們可以反觀事實，中國近十年來，關於衛生知識的傳播，似乎不能說是没有相當的成績，個人方面之知道講求衛生的也頗不乏人，各種不衛生的舉動，爲我們所發現的也不如以前的那樣多，那樣利害，各地的衛生建設｜除掉一些偏僻的省分和交通不便的内地以外，幾個大都會似乎也祗有着進步的。但是時疫仍然照例的猖獗着。這是什麽原因呢？這原因很簡單，就是知道衛生的，僅僅乎是中上階級的人，能夠享受衛生的也僅僅乎是中上階級的人，而那些無數的貧民階級，不但不知道衛生，而且也没有這力量來衛生。因爲他們衣食尙不周全，更何衛生之有，中上階級的人儘管堅守着衛生的壁壘，以爲一切的傳染病，都可以避免了！而這些製造傳染病的貧民階級，不斷的將生産過剩的病菌傳播過來，大都市的四通八達的馬路上，雖然是清潔了！而隠藏在這些馬路背後的貧民窟裏輸送出來的病菌，終久是無法隔絶的啊！所以提倡公共衛生，應當先以改進貧民階級的生活着手，雖不能說是一個包括一切的辦法，但至少總可以收着消弭傳染病的效果的。</p>
<p>不知道衛生而不衛生，那麽這種人僅僅乎是愚得可憐，知道衛生而没有力量來衛生，換句話說，就是環境不許他衛生，那眞有點慘得可怕了！假使我們睜開了眼睛一看，貧民階級的同胞，實在太多了！他們住的極壞的下等房屋，穿的極骯髒的衣服，喫的極惡劣的飮食，做的極勞動的工作，總之，他們是終年的處在黑暗的天地裏，而這種黑暗所隠藏着的，不外是些無告的伸吟，無辜的疾病，不斷的死亡，於是這偌大的黑暗區域裏，就無形的成爲一個傳染病的製造所了！每一個貧民的矮屋裏，幾乎成爲一架病菌製造的機器。他們是旣没有衛生的知識，又没有衛生的能力的，提倡公共衛生的朋友們，是不是應該注意到這一點？</p>
<p>我們對於這種大多數貧民階級的救濟，是要兩方面同時并行的，一方普及衛生敎育，使他們知道衛生，一方改良環境，以增進他們的生活，毀掉他們的黑暗的牢獄似的住屋，而另建築和開設一種最經濟最衛生的居住的地方及飮食的地方，以解决他們的住食問題，對於他們的疾病是要設立一種施診所來代他們診視的。要曉得傳染病的感染，以身體弱的人爲易，因爲營養的不佳，所以抵抗力也就薄弱了！而我們不幸的貧民階級遂給予病菌以最易侵襲的機會了！假使我們注意到這點，使得他們環境變佳，身體變强，病菌根本就無處容身，這不是一個釜底抽薪的方法嗎？</p>
<h3>診餘隨筆（續）</h3>
<p>— 陳方之</p>
<p>有了重心，是萬事脚踏實地進步的根本。我們聽見歷史家說，英國的進步，重心在國旗，日本的進步，重心在皇室，因爲有了重心，全國人民的努力，信仰，與視聽，都有一個鵠的可以集中，而重心的一舉一動，足使全社會懾服而影從，政治如此，文化如此，醫事也何獨不如此。</p>
<p>各國的醫事重心，大抵在於大學，大學敎授，日夜分科研求，開會探討，都是飽學精思，對於已往的業績，莫不彙貫通曉，而樹立其未來的探究方針，都能站在同一系統的光明之路，全使國人民，確信其有解决疾病的複雜現象之能力，所以一有了難題，都拿到大學裏去解决，萬衆同心，上下如一，没有異議的。我們舉幾個有名的例來說··拿破崙患腹痛，軍醫莫能决，是巴黎大學敎授歌林氏斷定爲胃癌的，濱口首相被單刀剌後，其創口雖平復，而腹痛發𤍠，羣醫束手，是東京大學敎授鹽田氏，診</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>斷爲腺狀菌病的。</p>
<p>後來鹽田氏且親身到法庭證明，這個腺狀菌病的加劇，單刀是一個動機，使其潛伏性變成能働性，促短首相壽命的，因此拿單刀的剌客，罪名加重了一等，他們大學敎授說句話，上自總統天皇，下至囚人乞丐，莫不俯首帖耳，奉爲圭臬，這是學術的權威，這是重心的妙用。</p>
<p>如今我們的中國，醫事有没有重心呢，這個問題，應劃分爲兩個時代而說，在新醫學未嘗進口以前，事實上足以支配全國信仰的重心，向來是没有的，那時人民求重心的心理，不外乎兩種，一爲徼倖心理，一爲泥古心理，「丹方一味，氣殺名醫」，「趁我十年運，有病快來醫」，這一類俗語，正是十足代表徼倖心理的證據，紅廟求籤，肚仙看病，濟生會用法術，也不外乎出於這種心理，至於泥古心理，乃支配於中上社會之間，</p>
<p>當過太醫院御醫的流行，儒醫的尊重，正是泥古心理的表現，因爲儒醫與御醫，是比時醫飽讀醫書的，素問，靈樞，金匱，看得懂的，而所謂儒醫御醫的本身，當然並没有確確實實醫病的統計發表過，也没有新新鮮鮮發明的學業公佈過，上行下效，漠然迷信就是了。</p>
<p>到了西醫輸入以後，其一部分信仰西醫的人們，驟然得了一個重心，就是眞正的碧眼黃鬚的外國醫生，尤以在上海灘上的夷塲地界，英美德法日各國醫生都全備，宏大的醫院也有，客棧式醫院也有，没有醫學的國人，反能比柏林巴黎的市民還幸福，隨其心意，自由選擇，享受萬國九州新醫學的恩典，不勞而獲的國民，多麽寫意呀，你看上海灘上的時髦朋友，一有疑難雜症不是就趕快拿去解决呀。</p>
<p>然而看官聽說，如果現成的福氣，眞的能彀受到，那一國的國民，没有這個懶惰心理呢，不要慌，我且舉幾個實例，忠忠實實地寫出來，究竟配不配做我國的醫事重心呀，我們大家來吟味想想。</p>
<p>有一位安徽屯溪人羅君，二個月前，特地到上海來醫眼睛的，初時到某君處求診，據他自己說，鄕間舊式眼科醫，診他是内障，西醫能開刀割去的，所以到上海來醫，某君一看，白内障確實是有的，但是瞳孔不正形，有發過虹彩炎的痕跡，再檢查其眼底，其玻璃體且滷濁，而眼壓增高，明明有緣内障的徵象，所以其表面的白内障，是炎性複雜性續發性的，照規矩不能開刀，慢慢待其炎症消散，還能保持其幾分目力，某君就這樣的對他說，但他似信非信的去了，後來過了一月，眼涙汪汪的又來了，他說被某大醫院的某國醫生，馬馬虎虎開了一刀，内障是除了，眼睛是黑了，并幾分的目力也逃走了，還有什麽挽救的方法，方法當然是没有的，這是外國醫生成績之一，</p>
<p>有一位同鄕姜君，發𤍠十三四天，看醫生吃藥以後退了，但到了退𤍠後，反而腹部脹痛，大小便不通，（雖灌腸也無效。）承一位某醫生，招了一位某國大夫來會診，說是急性獺尾炎或盲腸炎，立刻要施破腹術，否則生命懸而無卜了。（本節未完）</p>

<p>所謂運動者。苟循規則施行。固能期望其充足之發展。然有數種之運動。若不出於競技之方法。殊鮮興味。然一入競技之中。即當决定雙方之勝負。而更饒有興味以喚起其競爭矣。</p>
<p>學校與學校之競爭旣啓。於是爲爭勝負之故。學校咸以養成優秀之選手爲目的。由其偏重於競技之趨勢。以致陷於漠視體育之弊。是以國家雖日日高唱振興體育。實際上則振興競技而已。此亦有不得已之處。欲救其弊。厥在醫家起而研究由運動所起之弊害。竭力以除去之减少之。方爲得策。</p>
<p>學校方面。固有所謂校醫在也。然而學校當局不加信任。甚且委之舊醫之手。而爲校醫者。亦僅以有疾病時即赴診察。或施行體格檢查而止。對於學校敎育上之運動的研究。殆無其人。故欲謀體育之發展。學校當局與校醫雙方。非澈底的革改其觀念。不可也。</p>
<p>然則學校之體育當如何進行乎？宜於體操及游泳之先。校醫有區别學生體質之必要。自一般言之。身體虚弱之兒童。優良之敎師與賢明之父母。有令其停止體操之必要。或完全停止之。或先行身體檢查以定其適合於何種體操。蓋有身體虚弱之兒童。經過適當之體操。有逐漸强壯其身體者。浸假而競技亦堪以加入矣。故僅以身體虚弱。尙不能爲停止體操之理由者也。（參觀拙著體育之科學的基礎。作者書社經售。）</p>

<h3>日本的「浪人」</h3>
<p>— 侍桁</p>
<p>見報載，長春本月三十日的路透電，當地日本領事館，警界及憲兵當局，凖備將在滿的日本浪人按名驅逐出境。據說凡合於下列五種資格的，都可以稱爲浪人；一，組織秘密會社，從事政治上陰謀，以激起糾紛者；二，利用日滿官員的名義，冀獲得非正當之特權及利益者；三，以欺詐行爲勒索欵項者；四，行爲有玷及日本民族之聲譽者；五，行動妨及「滿洲國」之發展者。總觀這五條，是給了在滿的日本浪人下了警告，使他們更守規矩一下。因爲他們現在是「妨及「滿洲國」的發展」，「有玷日本民族的聲譽」，甚至有「政治上的陰謀而激起糾紛」的了。</p>
<p>「浪人」這個名詞，在日本可以說是歷史的名詞了，其意義是和流氓差不多的，是一些失業的胡作非爲的窮光蛋。在秩序井然的日本帝國的社會裏，這些人，毫無疑義是應該殺頭的東西。不過，這些浪人却對於日本帝國有着極大的用處，而且事實上在過去他們是有着功績的。他們成了日本帝國主義侵略的先鋒。這是日本政府最聰明的辦法，可以說是廢物利用，留他們在國裏是只有擾亂社會上的秩序，使良民不安，但若把他們派遣到日帝國主義勢力所及的被壓迫的弱小民族的地方去，他們可以作了鐵騎或密探所作不了的事，而且一旦被發見或被殺，旣可實際上替帝國除害而又可作爲外交上的藉口。所以在中國凡是日本人民所到的地方，所謂浪人就總不少，在「滿洲國」的各地不用說了，在上海，在天津，在濟南等中國的各大商埠裏，浪人也是頗爲活躍的。他們販賣紅丸嗎啡，輸送槍械子彈，勾結流氓組織便衣隊擾亂中國城市，無惡不作，但我們從來也没有聽到日本帝國下過什麽嚴禁或驅逐的命令，反之，他們倒是受着特殊法律的保護，一旦遭遇了意外，他們身價的昂貴是抵得過中國人幾百或幾千人的生命的。</p>
<p>但爲什麽現在在滿洲國裏有了要驅逐浪人的命令發表出來呢？</p>
<p>當然，第一，「滿洲國」現在已經是自家人了，該開始維持社會的平安；第二，新開的買賣要對着受苦受難的小伙計們施點帝國的恩惠，而且對外也要保持點帝國在國際上的聲譽｜｜這些已經足夠作爲驅逐浪人的理由。况且命令是給人看的，實際上究竟如何，那有誰曉得</p>
<p>但縱使實際上有那麽一回事，也不要因此就同情浪人，以爲日本大帝國是忘恩負義的傢伙。君不見，從前的浪人現在不已經有許多是變成新的國度的官員了麽？如果從前是浪人，現在還是浪人，那正是表示了粥少僧多，難以收容的明證，驅逐在名義上雖不好聽，而實際上是爲他尋找出路的。有那一個傻瓜肯相信這些浪人會用船載回帝國的内地裏去？</p>
<p>然則這些浪人將被驅逐到那裏呢？而且日常國在如今這樣世界經濟恐慌之下是産生着不斷的浪人的，舊的浪人成了統制階級的一員，新的浪人又來了，那裏是他們的收容的目的地呢？</p>
<p>這問題我們中國人應當想一想！</p>
<h3>魔窟</h3>
<p>— 青農</p>
<p>夜裏，躑躅於神秘之街。</p>
<p>秋雨蕭蕭地落着，路燈就如含涙的巨跟。爲着避雨躱進了Isis的門廊，望了飛馳着的汽車，電車，與黃包車在發呆</p>
<p>雨再不停，今夜怎的回家，路那麽遠</p>
<p>對面，新雅的Neon招牌眩人眼睛，虬江路口的警察揮着棍子在吆喝黃包車夫。幾個穿着雨衣的青年吹着哨子從我的身邊走道。秋雨還是蕭蕭地落着。</p>
<p>旣然找到了朋友，就不該怕難爲情似地不張口。</p>
<p>心頭有點悔恨，一眼正望着那含涙似的閃爍着的路燈！</p>
<p>「哈囉！」是誰站在眼前打招呼，一看正是那位剛才分手的朋友。</p>
<p>「還没回家？走吧走吧，今晚無聊得很，跳舞去。」</p>
<p>帶拉帶勸，没幾步已經進了「月宮舞塲」。上了樓，便有侍役過來給你拿帽脫秋大衣，｜已經上了魔窟口，且看魔窟今年又成什麽樣？</p>
<p>冷清清的，祗見蛇一樣的魔女之羣，客人有如和烏雲之夜掙扎着的星星，燈轉顔色，音樂剌耳，原來樂師已經不是黑臉孔的菲律賓人了。</p>
<p>在音樂的旋律裏，脚怪癢癢的想難座，可是，······</p>
<p>燈亮，樂停，朋友回來了，說··</p>
<p>「怎麽？没有熟的舞侶？」</p>
<p>「不，近來，｜不想跳。」</p>
<p>「是？（做手勢）没有帶？我請你。」</p>
<p>在音樂的旋律裏，忘記了一切，舞着舞着。</p>
<p>那魔女眉峯緊鎖，輕愁的雲翳籠住了眼的湖與鼻的嶺，</p>
<p>「這裏不景氣呵！」我半對自己說的半問了她。</p>
<p>「這裏什麽？」</p>
<p>「生意不大好呵？」</p>
<p>「唔，生意不行。」</p>
<p>「那你怎麽不到别處去？」</p>
<p>「别處還不是一樣？」</p>
<p>「那末，怎麽不改業？」</p>
<p>「找不到事體，才來這裏，怎麽說改業？」</p>
<p>［·········］我祗得啞口無言。</p>
<p>［你在那個公司裏？］</p>
<p>［唔，唔，··········］我更難以回答她的话！</p>
<p>說是入魔窟找剌激，她的話正是使我心跳不寗的剌激，人們是找的快樂與麻醉的剌激，我這回那剌激就如一把利刃戳入我的心坎，痛苦辛酸！</p>
<p>窗外雨停了。藉口頭痛立刻逃出了那魔窟，音樂還𢌞蕩在耳裏，那魔女的輕愁的容貌還依然貼在腦膜上。</p>
<p>然而在心裏，沉沉地忽然閃過了一個思想··</p>
<p>何不將那化在魔窟裏的錢，給我應付催得要命的房租和飯賬，</p>
<h3>再從［别字］談起</h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>｜答高植，高明兩先生</p>
<p>這當然不是意氣之爭。</p>
<p>我幾次替别字張目，並不是說寫别字可以成爲别字運動，大家來提倡提倡。（高植先生誤會我贊成［各自爲政］式的寫别字，高明先生還要完全用别字寫一篇文章來考試我。我不是說語言文字是社會的通用貨幣嗎？各自爲政的寫别字，它不是擾亂［金融市塲］嗎？雖至愚下，决不至此。）只是說青年所以寫别字讀别字，根本應師罪於方塊字的難識難寫，我們應順着趨勢作根本的改革。爲什麽要順着趨勢呢？因爲過去的假借字通借字，數目說起來可驚，有三千多個；這些寫别字老祖宗所寫的别字，罪孽深重，不自殞滅，迫着我們非寫别字讀别字不可；我們還不起這滿身債，只好放開鐵算盤總結一下，所以有簡字和新形聲字的建議。（高明先生贊成［用旣成而禁未成］的態度，這是不可能的，因爲這並不能執人人之耳而告之的。例如［青陽港］本是［新陽港］，［眞茹］本是［眞如］，禁亦無從禁，用亦無從用。章太炎先生論通借假借，謂前人的别字已多，我們不必再寫别字，其意與高先生相近，但我們如何能使他們不寫呢？）</p>
<p>簡字運動，早有人提倡並實行過，（高植先生的主張，我也極端贊成。）現在我只談談我所主張的新形聲字。六年前，我在杭州舊書店買到一本龐大的漢英韵府，（同治年間出版，美人Willliam著）卷端有一張一千零四十基字表使我發生興趣。歐洲人研究中國文字，頗有用科學方法來師納方塊字的野心；所謂一０四０基字者，其意謂分析中國文字，有這一些基本母體。（此書燬於一二八之役，憑我記憶所及，分析並不十分邏輯。）我因思中國文字的演進中，以形聲字的增加爲最多；我們能把一切字都改爲形聲字，則誦讀記憶都簡理得多。（中國字的檢查，前人從聲，後人從形。從形，本以部首爲主；近人新檢字法，多至九十七種，無一可用。改爲形聲字，檢字法亦得一總解决。）並且字音全部確定，筆畫全部減少，則讀别字寫别字的通病可以一旦捐除了。</p>
<p>我所設想的新形聲字是這樣··（依我主張應稱養聲字，形聲字從舊名。）所有方塊字都分成左形右聲，右形左聲，上形下聲，下形上聲，外形内聲五種，不規則的都補凑得使合規則。凡聲的部份，廢棄原文改用國音拚合。（詳細辦法，另見新形聲字私議一文中）形的部份，採用通用簡俗字再加以擴充。這可以說沿舊貫的十之七，就舊貫擴充的十之一，新增的十之二；即在我們自己學習起來，並不十分困難。｜可笑得很，這是改良主義。當然，［語言文字的發達，開端雖是個人，而完成的却是社會。］我的張目，豈敢拂人所好，不過貢獻一點私見，抛磚引玉，想請注意中國文字改革的先生們指敎而已。</p>
<h3>兩兄弟（十九）</h3>
<p>Z&gt;莫泊桑著李維克譯</p>
<p>僅僅祗有一盞煤氣燈點在那堆着許多玻瓶的賬櫃上。爲了省錢的緣故，店面的煤氣燈全没有點。這賬櫃後面，有一個秃頭的老人伸長兩腿，坐在一把椅子上，他那巨大的　嘴鼻子連接在那光額上，使他現出一副鸚鵡似的愁容。他這時已經熟睡了，下巴擱在胸口。</p>
<p>他聽着門鈴的響聲便醒過來了，他立起身，看明白是醫生，便伸長兩手迎上來。</p>
<p>他那滿是酸類和糖汁的污痕的黑色禮服，穿在瘦弱矮小的身軀上　······太大了，現得像是一件古代的道袍似的；他說話時，波蘭口音很重，聽去有幾分孩子氣，並且發音含混，也和牙牙學語的小孩相似。</p>
<p>筆爾坐了下來，瑪洛斯科問他道··</p>
<p>［有什麽新聞嗎，親愛的醫生？］</p>
<p>［没有。一切如舊。］</p>
<p>［你今晚臉上現得不快活呀。］</p>
<p>［我不是天天快活的。］</p>
<p>［好啦，好啦，我們要排去一切煩悶才行。你要喝一杯甜酒嗎？］</p>
<p>［好的，我很想喝。］</p>
<p>［那麽我來給你嘗嘗一種新的配合罷。兩月來我便在試着用覆盆子製酒，這東西至今還祗有人拿去做菓子露··········好啦，我成功了······成功了······這是一種極好的甜酒，極好的，極好的，］</p>
<p>於是他非常高興的，跑到一隻玻璃櫃前，開了櫃，揀出一隻小玻璃瓶來了。他以短促的手勢摇動這玻璃，他這種手勢是絶不會做完全的，他絶不會把他的手臂完全伸長，把他的兩腿充分跨開，他絶不會做出一個完整的確定的動作。他的思想也和他的行動一樣；他把他所想的事指示出來，預約下來，粗略的描繪出來，或是暗示出來，但决不說明出來。</p>
<p>他平素最𤍠心的事似乎就是配合一些菓子露和甜酒。［祗要能夠製出一種好的菓子露或是好的甜酒，我們是可以發財的，］他常是這樣說。</p>
<p>他曾經發明過將近百種的甜料，可是一種都没有能夠銷行起來。筆爾曾說瑪洛斯科使他想起瑪納。</p>
<p>他跑到店堂臺面，在那配合飮料的木板上取來了兩隻小杯；隨後兩人便把酒杯舉到煤氣燈下騐看那甜酒的顔色</p>
<p>［美麗的紅寳石啊！］筆爾說。</p>
<p>［不是嗎？］</p>
<p>波蘭人那鸚鵡似的老腦袋現得快樂極了。</p>
<p>醫生把酒嘗了一口，玩味着，细想着，再嘗一口，又再细想了一下，然後說道··</p>
<p>［很好，很好，並且味道很新；新愛的，這簡直是一種發明呢！］</p>
<p>［啊！眞的，我很高興。］</p>
<p>於是瑪洛斯科同他商量給這新酒取一個名兒··他想把牠呌做［覆盆子精］，或是［優等覆盆子精］，或是［特製覆盆子］，或是［頭號覆盆子］。‘</p>
<p>筆爾對於這許多名字一個都不贊成。</p>

<h3>日本统制米穀之設施</h3>
<p>— 氷玉</p>
<p>柳堂按，日本米産，以改良進步之結果，而豐收爲患，於是而謀統制，今已實行矣。然其法之大意，猶是常平之說也。吾國自管子主輕重歛散，遂開均輸平準之端。魏李惺鑒於穀賤则傷農，穀貴則傷民，思有以策兩全，而有常平之制。常平者，穀賤則糴，貴則糶，與管子歛之以輕，散之以重，其揆固一也。然其所難者在乎糴，糴則需財，公家固有此如許財力否？卽有之矣，設連年豐穰時如何？在古時對於價格貴賤之標準，自無今之科學化，但如日本統制米穀之辦法，要亦不使之無甚貴，無甚賤，顧全農民生計，毋致所得不償所費；亦使一般生活，不至爲維持米價，而感覺負担之加重。然以日本幅員仄狹，一切生産消費調查統計，較有規模，尙覺其價格之規定，收買之不易，前途猶多困難。若事無其設備，地無其狹小，而亦輕言統制，誠不知計將安出，行將何苦也？茲集日本書報所載最近施行統制米穀情形，由氷玉先生迻譯成文，聊供參考。惜以時間怱促，篇幅有限，不克周至，尙祈鑒諒。</p>
<h3>一統制米穀之由來</h3>
<p>日本自十餘年來，陶充稻種，改良耕種，穀物産額逐年增加，去年復達三年來未有之豐收，而朝鮮臺灣，亦頻年豐登，米穀輸入日本者甚夥。日本本缺米，取資於臺鮮，仰給於暹缅，至是亦患過剩，穀價暴落，存米充斥，較往年所增幾一倍，米價旣跌，農民所得不償所費，而經濟困難，而農村破産，而蠢然思動，社會不安。若不亟圖補救，新米上市，價格愈益低落，勢將引起全國農村崩潰，日政府鑒於危機日深，而統制米穀之問題以起。顧統制米穀所難者。</p>
<p>（一）爲殖民地米穀之輸入問題。蓋臺鮮米之輸入日本。足以制日本内地農民之死命；然而阻止臺鮮米穀之輸入，勢必引起臺鮮農民之反抗，又必促成臺鮮米穀價值之暴落，則在日本統制殖民地政策上，不免發生重大影響。故政府當局，爲維持國内農民之生計，與調節殖民地生産之過剩起見，頒布米穀統制法，同時制定殖民地米穀統制之具體方針，兼籌並顧，使内外米穀之需供關係，得保平衡。但存米旣多。新米又旺，豐年飢饉之現象，日益迫切，爲救濟目前之危急，乃施行公定最高最低價格，以調節米價之變動。再則日本國内耕作米之面積，占主要農産物耕作面積之四五　。水田面積，占全耕地面積之五五％。日本人口，其半數爲農民，而農産物全體平均在百分之五０至六０間，已成爲商品生産化，米則平均佔百分之五０｜六０間，亦成爲商品化。但米之購買力，不過就全農業所具購買力之半，因此農業之米穀生産對於商工業亦成爲重要問題，此日本政府統制米穀所以急不容緩也。</p>
<h3>二　日本米之生産消費</h3>
<p>如前所述，日本因米穀産額豐富，反造成豐年飢饉之現象，已爲不可諱之事實。查本年八月間存米之數，達一千萬石，新米登場，約四五百萬石，頓使市場發生絶大恐慌。照九月之市價而言，每石僅七八元左右，此七八元之代價，不足以償農民之生産費。據日本帝國農會之調查，米每石之生産費，若以土地資本按三分計算，爲二十二元七角；照四分計算，爲二十四元八角；而最近十年間之平均，爲三十一元四角五分；（土地資本利子照三分計算）若在出産地之原價計算，爲十七元；每石損失在五元以上，再加其他一切費用；當在二十五元。然現今米價，僅二十一二元，因此農民之損失甚大，故急宜提高米價，以補償農民之損失。而且所以致此者，實因生産增加消費减少故也。茲就十年來日本内地朝鮮台灣之生産額，分列如下··（面積單位千町步，收穫單位千石）</p>
<p>日本内地　朝鮮　台灣</p>
<p>（卽民國十一年）　耕作而積　收穫額　耕作面積　收穫額　耕作面積　收穫額</p>
<p>大正十一年　三、一四０　六０、六九三　一、五五七　一五、０一四　五二九　五、四四五</p>
<p>十二年　三、一四七　五六、四四四　一、五五０　一五、一七四　五二二　四、八六五</p>
<p>十三年　三、一四二　五七、一七０　一、五七五　一三、二一九　五四七　六、０七六</p>
<p>十四年　三、一五三　五九、七０三　一、五八七　一四、七七三　五六七　六、四四三</p>
<p>昭和元年　三、一五八　五五、五九二　一、五八七　一五、三００　五八四　六、二一四</p>
<p>昭和二年　三、一七三　六二、一０二　一、六０二　一七、二九八　六０三　六、八九八</p>
<p>昭和三年　三、一九二　六０·三０三　一、五七　一三、五一一　六０五　六、七九五</p>
<p>昭和四年　三、二一０　五九、六六八　一、六三二　一九、一八０　六三三　七、三七０</p>
<p>昭和五年　三、二三九　六六、八七五　一、六六二　一九、一八０　六三三　七、三七０</p>
<p>昭和六年　三、二四八　五五、二一五　一、六七四　一五、八七二　六五三　七、四七九</p>
<p>昭和七年　三、二五七　六０、三九０　一、六四三　一六、三四五　六八四　八、九四九</p>
<p>照上列各表觀之，耕作面積與收穫數量，均逐年增加，此係日本對於農業經營漸次改善之結果也。然而消費方面，反形减少，卽大正十五年（民國十五年）每人一年之消費量，爲一石一斗三升二合，昭和二年爲一石九升八合，四年爲一石一斗二合，五年爲一石七升二合，七年爲一石八合，比大正十五年時，竟减少一斗二升四合，生産與消費，正在反對方面進行，故對於米價問題之根本解决，本極困難。最甚者，台鮮米之輸入日本内地，逐年增加，自大正十一年以至昭和七年其輸入額如下··（單位千石）</p>
<p>年次　朝鮮米　台灣米</p>
<p>大正十一年　三、一三六　七四０</p>
<p>十二年　三、四五三　一、一三一</p>
<p>十三年　四、五四七　一、六五八</p>
<p>十四年　四、四二八　二、五二二</p>
<p>昭和元年　五、二一三　二、一八六</p>
<p>二年　五、五０九　二、六三七</p>
<p>三年　七、０六八　二、四五０</p>
<p>四年　五、三七七　二、五五三</p>
<p>五年　五、一六七　二、一八五</p>
<p>六年　七、九九二　二、六九二</p>
<p>七年　七、一九七　三、四二０</p>
<p>（註）日本内地米穀之産量，旣逐年增加，而台鮮米之輸入，又復逐年旺盛，致内地米價不得不跌落也。</p>
<h3>三　日本之米穀生産費</h3>
<p>日本帝國農會，爲謀全國的統制與决定標準米價起見，曾派岡田温調查米穀之生産費。凡種子·肥料·各種材料·工資·畜力·農具費·農舍費·公課·土地資本利子等，均在調查之列。肥料所費，據其調查所得，祇就自給肥料，其費用有如下列統計。</p>
<p>肥料種類　自大正十一年至昭和四年　昭和五年　昭和六年　昭和七年</p>
<p>元　　元　　元　元</p>
<p>普通堆厩肥　五·三一　二·一０　一·五五　一·三八</p>
<p>紫雲英　三·六七　一·三二　０·九二　０·八一</p>
<p>豆粕　四·六三　二·二二　一·六０　一·四二</p>
<p>野草　四·六八　一·四０　一·０四　０·九四</p>

<p>至於購入肥料，包括肥料購買費，以及其他運送雜費在内，自給肥　　市價時照市價計算，無市價時則購肥料性質評定。</p>
<p>米之生産費，就自耕農與佃農，分别計算如左··</p>

<p>日本農林省對於米之生産費，雖經帝國農會調查，然卒未公佈。迨昭和五年發生農業恐慌，米價暴落，始知從前之米穀法，認爲無力，而米價問題，遂發生種種波灡。至昭和六年，决行大改正，但改正米穀法，須先明米穀之生産，乃再派員會同全國農家千三十户而爲綿密的調查，至本年三月，此改訂米穀法又廢。重定新米穀統制法，於是米之生産費，尤認爲重要。然農林省之調查米之生産費，其目的以算出米價政策之基礎生産費爲目的。調查方法，（一）購入肥料，（二）工資，分自家勞動與僱傭，長年僱傭以月僱工資計算，月僱者以實際給付費計算，（三）農費舍加上修繕費及地基借貸費與稻作用農舍之减價額，（四）租稅公課，（五）自作農之土地資本利子，（六）佃農之佃租，（七）每石出産費扣除副收入之收獲量，據其調查結果，昭和六七年度如下、</p>

<h3>四　統制米穀之法令</h3>
<p>日本先有統制米穀法，而施行令之公布，爲最近間事，亦於本月（十一月）一日起施行矣。茲將米穀統制法詳其網要，施行令幾全文迻詳，蓋以其所言多爲辦法，足以供參證也。</p>
<p>統制法　（一）本法之目的，爲調節米穀之數量與市價，並圖米穀之統制，得以買進或賣出之。（二）政府每年應公定米穀之最高價格及最低價格，但决定最低最高價格，須參酌米穀生産費，家計費，與物價，以及其他經濟事情。（三）爲維持最低最高價格，得依申請而實行米穀之買進賣出。（四）爲防備由道府縣在該地域外或由朝鮮台灣出米時輸入之米穀之過旺期，得以月别平均買進米穀，至過旺期後賣出之。（五）因前二項之賣買所發生附帶事項，政府爲貯藏所有米穀買換交換加工整理等起見賣出之；又以米穀之輸入爲目的，得行買進或賣出。（六）對於米穀之輸出入，實施許可制。（七）在必要時得指定期間，得制限粟黍高粱之輸入。（八）在必要時得指定期間，將米穀粟高粱之輸入稅，增減或免除之。</p>
<h3>五　殖民地米穀之統制</h3>
<p>日本爲謀發揮米穀統制法之效能，除將國内米穀通盤籌劃外，並謀統制朝鮮台灣米之生産，以期與國内不致衝突，茲就其統制台鮮米的具體計畫，分述如下。</p>
<p>（一）朝鮮之生産統制　朝鮮自規定十二年計畫以來，（自大正十五年至昭和十二年）增加生産八百萬石，致朝鮮米之輸入日本内地，頗爲旺盛，於是國内農民，大受影響。今旣公佈統制法，不得不將十二年增産計畫停止，以防鮮米之陸續輸入。但當局爲謀朝鮮農民增收起見，自明年度起，規定十年計畫，奬勵裁培棉花，因棉花之生産費低廉，將來需要必增，對於農家自身之收入，亦有相當之利得，非若米穀之供給過剩，釀成豐作恐慌。奬勵方法，一方交付奬勵金，同時以低利資本，借貸農民，農民受政府金融之補助，自樂於改種，他方爲謀棉花之出路，建設精棉工場。</p>
<p>（二）台灣之統制計畫　台灣自水利事業計畫完成，與品種之改良，近年來米穀生産額，亦非常增加，幾達一千萬石。現爲補救統制法起見，將台灣水稻田，奬勵種植甘藷，同時中止開田計畫，變爲旱地栽培甘藷。蓋奬勵栽培甘藷，除可製造精糖外，並得改製酒精與汽油。奬勵方法，卽交付奬勵金與融通低利資本，並建造制造精糖酒精汽油工塲等，故朝鮮台灣兩地，按照改作方法實行，農民之收入，必較現今米作爲多。</p>
<h3>六　公定價格及其缺點</h3>
<p>米穀統制法施行令第五條所規定，最高公定價格，係照現在物價情形提高二成至三成範圍内，參酌經濟事情而言之。卽此規定，最高公定價格，照現在物價提高二成計算，爲三十元三角六分，提高至三成時，則爲三十二元八角九分，在此二數間决定之，至於最低公定價格在二十二元五角左右，但在未發表最低價格以前，本來之價格，在二十四元内外。迨農林大臣提出數字後，卽低减至二十三元七角，共與公定最低價格二十二元五角，相差一元七角，蓋日來當局，早已參照産地情形與新米上市之時價，故全國市塲，並不因新布法令而起不安。惟照米穀委員會之主張，對於標準價格，議論紛紜，蓋决定標準，須就十一月與十二月之公定價格關係决定之，最低價格應保持一切生産費用，且本年度之生産費與去年度比較（去年度爲二十元八角六分，爲低，均主張爲二十二元七角，結果仍照農林省所提原案通過，茲將農林省發表照米穀統制法就各縣公定價格之差别如下。</p>
<p>地方　以四等爲機準時在等級價格之上　以四等爲標準時在等級價格之下</p>
<p>一等　二等　三等　四等　五等</p>
<p>荒川　九０　七０　四０　八０　七０</p>
<p>新瀉其他　九０　七０　四０　一二０　七０</p>
<p>富山　一二０　九０　五０　一二０　七０</p>
<p>石川　一二０　九０　五０　一二０　六０</p>
<p>福井　一二０　九０　五０　九０　｜｜</p>
<p>岐阜　一三０　一００　五０　三０　｜｜</p>
<p>尾張　一三０　一００　五０　三０　｜｜</p>
<p>三河　一三０　一００　五０　五０　｜｜</p>
<p>三重　一三０　一００　五０　二０　｜｜</p>
<p>湖北　一三０　一００　六０　一四０　｜｜</p>
<p>湖東　一二０　九０　五０　七０　｜｜</p>
<p>湖南　一二０　九０　五０　三０　｜｜</p>
<p>以下山城等三十五縣省略</p>
<p>規定之最代最高價格，日本朝野，認爲不當。何則，蓋米穀價格，降至最低價格時，日政府不得不依請求而爲無制限的，將米買進。然政府究能無制限的買進有無此應付之資力與否，亦屬疑問？卽能備一年之資力，若今後二三年間，仍繼續廉價，恐難應付。且因買進而受損失，亦無制限。加以米穀之生産費與當時之經濟事情，以及其他有關係方面，應加參酌，以决定最低價格。然目下日政府所調查生産費，實際上仍不能包括普通的生産費，故其所定最低價格二十二元五角，仍認爲不當。蓋若詳細調查，應在二十三元以上也。夫米穀政策之主旨，須保證米之最低價格，以不低於生産費，使普通農家繼續其事業，樂於農村生活爲目的，而最低價格之標準，務必在生産費中，加上農家業務收益，得有相當之利潤，卽對於農家經營農業之勞苦，得有相當之報酬是也，此爲經濟學上之原理。今日本農林省調查之生産費上，尙未加上經營報酬費，卽爲其缺點。因此日本識者，多主張米穀專賣論，不過實行米穀專賣，國庫仍須年年損失，但爲維持農村與社會安定計，比較尙爲妥當耳。</p>
<h3>施行令</h3>
<p>（第一條）最低價格及最高價格，依照每年十二月東京市與大阪市之市價公定之，但前項之最低最高價格，由農林大臣公佈當年出産之内地米之情形及等級定之。（第二條）最低價格，依照農林大臣所定標準最低價格，由農林大臣指定之各地行市及指定之米價最低價格，而爲總平均計算。按照命令所定，從其價格之差别，規定各地情形與行市及等級定之。卽前項標準最低價格，就當年出産之米穀生産費上，加以運費以及其他雜費等額，由米價指數與物價指數之關係中算出之價格，在農林大臣所指定之價格範圍内定之。前項農林大臣所指定之價格，在農林大臣所指定之價格由米價指數與物價指數之關係所算出之價格，相當於價格下低減一成至二成間之範圍内，並酌量經濟事情定之。（第三條）最高價格照農林大臣所定標準價格，與第二標準最低價格之差額，依照第二所定各地行市及等級之米穀之最低價格加上定之。此標準最高價格，本於調查當年之宗計費爲基礎所算出之價格，（家計米價），與米價指數及物價指數間之關係所算出之價格，並農林大臣所指定之價格範圍内定之。上述農林大臣所定之價格，從米價指數與物價指數之關係所算出價格之上二成至三成之範圍内，酌量經濟事情定之。（第四條）米穀生産費，依照命令所定，每年調查各農家之糙米一石生産費平均計算之，而糙米一石之産費，依照命令所定，包括種子肥料勞力畜力與其他材料費農舍農具賦稅公課部落恊議費以及因此（水利病虫驅除預防費）土地資本利子佃租及米穀檢查手數料等之合計額，扣除副收入之金額，除米穀收入數計算之。（第五條）運費以及其他，按照命令所定，由下列所定費用之合計額算出··（一）在農林大臣所指定地方主要米穀集散地所需，運送費及積載費，（二）由前項地主之主要米穀集散地至第一地之鐵道或船舶之運費，（三）在第一地所需之起卸費及小運送費。（第六條）家計米價，依照命令所定，白米一石之價格換算糙米一石之價格定之。白米一石之價格，依照命令所定，每年調查各方之家計費（除例外）算出平均家計費中之米價，與平均家計費中之副食物費，嗜好品費，交際費，修養娛樂費·旅行費·及貯蓄數之合計額，分别公布比例額之合計數平均，除去一地方之白米消費量計算。（第七條）最低價格與最高價格之改定，依照命令所定，根據第二條或第三條所規定行之。如米穀之需供狀况，發生急　變動或發生恐慌時，改定最低價格與最高價格，亦限於九月一日以後。（第八條）照米穀統制法第三條所規定，米穀之買入或銷售時，以東京市或大阪市以外之地，指定其銷售地時，由其地至東京大阪之運費及他費之範圍内，參酌農林大臣所指定金額，得規定買進與賣出之行市。（第九條）如有下列各項情事，政府依照米穀統制法所規定，得以拒絶買進賣出之聲請。（一）聲請數量，不達命令規定之數量時；（二）以包買或謀不當利得爲目的時·（第十條）照最高價格，當買進申請，如買進申請之行市及等級米穀非所有時，政府除對買進申請者，於申請時表示反對外，其他之行市及等級米穀，得以銷售。（第十一條）照米穀統制法第三條之規定，内地米之買進數量，於當年米穀年度，就年中推算移出數量，以月平均者爲四月分。該米穀年度從十一月至翌年二月間，從各月推算移出數量之合計額中扣除之數量爲度。朝鮮米與台灣米之買進數量之限度，根據前項算出之數量爲限度。（第十二條）照米穀統制法第四條之規定，所買相當數量之米穀，於當該米穀年度内賣出之；但該當於農林大臣所指定行市及等級，與農林大臣所指定之市場平均價格，在相當於標準最低價格之上，貴五分之價格時，不在此限。（第十三條）照米穀統制法第三條所規定，朝鮮米及台灣米之買進與賣出，則在各原産地行之，但有特别事情時，不在此限。（第十四條）在米穀之買換時，其買進與賣出，於同時期行之，但在八月至十月間，舉行賣出與新米出後舉行買進者，不在此限。（第十五條）道府縣借貸米穀，其米穀對於城鎭鄕·産業組合農會等，以農林大臣在適當條件貸借或賣出之。（第十六條）受米穀借貸之道府縣，照借貸同一數量之米穀日期，農林大臣指定返還時期，依上項所規定，應返還之米穀，照農林大臣所指定應歸還時期所屬之年産或前一年産之米穀，仍以同一之行市與等級或與同格者行之。（第十七條）照米穀統制法第七條之規定，米穀輸入與輸出之許可，在内地歸農林大臣，在朝鮮台灣樺太，則歸各地長官指定。（第十八條）與下列各項有關係時，照米穀統制法第七條所規定，毋須受許可，（一）於通商航海條約有特别規定時；（二）政府依米穀統制法，其米穀之買進賣出，受其委託之米穀輸入或輸出時，（三）船用品或旅客之携帶品與標本米以及其他性質相同之米穀，準其輸入輸出。</p>

<h3>敎師與學生　　爲［補習敎育而作］</h3>
<p>— 徐琳</p>
<p>不論在那一個學校裏，當然需要有［有精神的經騐的興趣的敎師］，但同時也必需有［有精神的始終不懈的努力的學生］。</p>
<p>最近在本刋上，連續發見了兩篇關於［敎師］的話，似乎都是站在［學生］的立塲說的，所談的也似乎專指的［補習敎育］；而我呢，從前也辦過［補習敎育］，對［補習敎育］自認尙有相當的認識，所以不禁替［敎師］呌起［屈］來。</p>
<p>在敎師，當然也是一個人，是人就當然要［吃飯］，那就决不能斥之爲［混飯吃］；而在每一個敎師的心中，也决没有不願意把學生敎好的。所以敎不好的原故，依舊是［能］的問題。</p>
<p>然而在［補習學校］中間，做［敎師］就比較困難了。因爲最困難的就是程度參差得利害，每每適合了程度低一點的學生，那程度比較高的就感不到興趣，而敎得稍微高深一點時，程度低的又感覺得趕不上了。在這個時候，［敎師惟有在標凖的水凖上，時時作一些比較精詳的解釋，以兼顧程度較低的學生而引起程度較高的學生的興趣。然而這是需要［高深的學識］的。</p>
<p>但是，在另一方面，這責任不是敎師一方面完全可以負起的。所謂以自己的勞力汗血所掙來的錢去自動的加入補習敎育的學生。往往是因了一時的衝動，而很少有持久心。所以到學期終了時，能始終不肯缺課的學生，竟可以說是鳳毛麟角，絶無僅有。這也就是我已往的引爲痛心而今日被引起的感喟了。</p>
<p>我也曾將學生所以逐漸少下去的原因加以精密的探討，而探討下來的結論是不外以下幾點··</p>
<p>第一是没有恒心，起初是因了一時的衝動，覺得自己的智識需要補充，然而經過了一二個月，又覺得平淡無奇了，於是［　趕］也就之而　退。然而一二個月的時間，當然不會有什麽益處的。第二是　難不前，補習敎育的時間是不　像一般［敎育］那般擅長的，所以發揮起來未免要快些，因此一般學生　　　事務忙碌無暇修習，或者根本是以讀書作消遣，試想以如此情形要從事於較［普通敎育］縮短數倍時間的［補習敎育］，當然感不到甚麽［興趣］了，於是由沮喪而停頓！然而，也有例外的。</p>
<p>總之，［補習敎育］之難於得到完善的結果，决不是單純敎師方面的事，學生亦須負相當責任的。因爲，一方面固然要敎師的［循循善誘］，而同時也必須學生的［始終努力］，方纔能夠和衷共濟，相得而益彰。</p>
<p>現在的［補習敎育］，尙未脫離萌芽時代，尙需要多量的建設，以求普遍。同時並須認清［補習敎育］的重要，因爲在經濟破産的現社會制度之下，能夠從小學而中學而大學，究竟是很少的，讀完中學已經難能可貴了，何况從事職業的人，大多是小學畢業後因爲要解决生活問題而無力繼續求學，一面從事職業一面追取智識又是最合理不過的工讀生活，所以對［補習敎育］的維護與助力，是誰也不應推諉而義不容辭的事。</p>
<p>數年前的［補習學校］内所見到的［毛病］，大槪到今日仍舊適用吧？質之於從事［補習敎育］的專家之前。</p>
<h3>說［身分］</h3>
<p>— 匡</p>
<p>［身分］這名詞，提起來非常耳熟，却並不廣遍的在人類中使用牠的權威。比方說，勞手動脚，賣肩膊力的一些苦命朋友，他們就不知道什麽呌做［身分］，簡直連意也不會意想到這個。他們兢兢以自持的，是每日把血汗換得着若干［跨跑］，（我不敢說若干［大羅］）就只管向提莊店去賣一件把藍布大衫，蹲在馬路旁邊嚼山東麵條，晚上睡在灶披間一類的地方鼾聲騰空，其餘是無所計較的了。</p>
<p>然而［身分］不僅是耳熟，實在有不少的人非常考究，遊工羣，籠統的說一句，是社會上比較出色的人物，詳明點，有做官的，有當買辦掮客的，也有學校裏的敎師，也有說是在讀書的大學生，也有專門玩玩的朋友，在生活上大槪都有兩三分優閒。</p>
<p>於此可知，［身分］與［身家］（也就是財富的佔有以及社會勢力等等）是淵源很深的，身家寛闊點的人，大抵把［身分］看得重，把［身分］提得高。</p>
<p>但也有據說有缺少［過夜米］的朋友，非常考究［身分］，這就逃不掉是尷𡯓的士大夫，原也是一些優秀份子。</p>
<p>於此更可知，講究［身分］，定有某種必然的好處，說起來，又實在犯晦澀，牠究竟是怎樣的一種東西？好處又究竟在那裏？實實難以分說。牠原是一種看不見摸不着抽象得可以的自尊意識，排塲就好比雲空走馬，飄飄然，只見向渺無涯際的天外飛跑。本來［身分］是實生活的放映，但是實生活低落了的人，也還要惶恐的保持着，甚至還想提升，統而言之，［身分］是精神是意識儘管向上爬的表現。</p>
<p>至於牠的好處呢，我實在體會不出來，覺得硬没有；要有的話，那我只好說是阿？的精神安慰。</p>
<p>話說回來，現在的人講究［身分］的與［身分］所生的魔力，却確乎很可以走筆直書，描出長幅的紀錄，就從衣食住的生活表現上來着筆點墨吧。</p>
<p>比方說，禮拜六晚上南京開來的快車，裏面多少有幾位考究［身分］的清官朋友，因爲是清官，錢袋或尙不很重，爲了來上海探訪朋友，或有其他尊事，若　下庽旅館，也往往要學着要人那麽，跟尾後梢，踏上一些大的飯店去，雖然付賬的時候，面孔很有些不自然，手指也有些慌張，但因爲是做官階級，而且做的又是首都的官，住小旅館是太低［身分］，所以勉强點都不可不上大飯店。</p>
<p>又比方一個窮極的智識份子，這一天的飯費　來路就不很　　，但　　　　　［身分］就算吃不飽｜也得踏上高樓雅座，貨眞價實的小販館裏，全是些不三不四的苦力在混，是萬萬不能夾進去去［身分］的。</p>
<p>又比方在十字街頭兜轉的吃過洋肉醬來的留學國民，分明此刻手邊有些不方便，只夠縫製件把［三一二］之類的布質長衫，却必不這樣辦，硬要到吳淞路去買舊洋裝穿，無非也是［身分］關係，留過學來再着長衫是最丢臉不過的事。</p>
<p>啊！［身分］原來就是這麽一套玩意兒！</p>
<p>啊！［身分］原來就是這麽一套玩意兒！</p>
<p>［身分］［身分］［身分］，虚僞云哉乎！</p>
<h3>吃飯　　學校生活片斷的回憶</h3>
<p>— 人</p>
<p>跑出了學校的大門，差不多已近一年了，想起了在學校裏生活的狀况，不覺要使人好笑起來，尤其是在膳堂裏的一幕，更滑稽得有趣；每在早膳午膳和晚膳以前，總是先敲一次凖備鐘，於是我們都纔了的幾個同學，三五成羣的候在膳堂門口，等待着最後鈴聲一響，我們就爭先恐後的直跑到膳廳裏去，飯堂裏盛着的菜和飯雖然談不到什麽美味可口，但是至少是很夠充飢的而無疑的。所以在悶上了三四小時課而挨餓着的我們，當這比山珍海味還鮮美，把高唱着的空城計的肚子征服了！總之我們那時是野心勃勃地大踏步底走入了膳堂，好像是列强蠶食大中華民國一般去蠶食這膳堂裏按排着的飯菜。我們大家說··［這是中國，堂堂有四千多年文化的中國··］</p>
<p>八個人實實足足，團團地坐滿了一桌子，做過了禱告和唱了吃飯歌（敎會學校大槪如此）後，開始實現我的政策，運用我的武器｜｜筷和匙｜｜在我們一桌上有懦怯如兎子的，有兇惡如獅子的，有的奸滑如狐狸的，有時我們用着猙獰的笑臉互相對視着，我們的眼光銳</p>
<p>現代名人書畫　顧曜君女士江蘇武進人研究書法造詣精深</p>
<p>揚雄丰四十餘游京師大司馬車騎將軍王音奇其文誰召以爲門下史荑雄待詺歲餘奏羽獵賦除爲郎給事黃門　耆老久　轉爲大夫恬　琴利好古而樂道癸酉月毘陵顧曜君</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>利地火熖灼灼地望着這僅有的五碗小菜上，我們都瞄凖了眼光用了我們的武器筷和匙去幹，在我們的心中，都在這樣的想··［先下手爲强，呀！你多吃了一塊，就是我少吃了一塊，我損失了吃的權利了，這飯菜是這樣獨一無二的一桌，而它又這樣底鎭靜地大唱其不抵抗主義任我們去剥削，蹧踏，吞併不管，下手不要落後。］於是狼呑虎嚥的倒底吃了一個夠飽，而傲津津地向膳堂的門口跑出了，懦怯如兎的同桌的人，仍舊是半飽半餓地看着人家唾涎而又望空碗而興嘆了。這吃飯的桌子，經過一度狼吞虎嚥的蹧踏得杯筷狼籍的桌子，終於是無人顧問了。</p>
<h3>［跑狗］</h3>
<p>— 際雪</p>
<p>科學家發明的東西。給人們生活上的便利和舒適。無疑地是值得萬萬世的崇拜的。但是因爲科學發達而造成的罪惡。貽害於萬萬世的。誰都不可說［没有］。</p>
<p>利用同類動物中自相殘殺和自相鬥爭的天性。而發明的賭博。在我國也着實不少。像鬥鷄蟋蟀等等玩意兒。都有狠悠久的歷史。</p>
<p>利用犬克兎，犬逐兎，和犬與犬競爭追逐的天性。於是發明［跑狗］。</p>
<p>［跑狗］是英國人發明的。風行已久。英國人對於［跑狗］的狂𤍠也較他國人爲甚。英國的大都市如倫敦利物浦和孟雀斯脫等地。没有一處没有規範宏大和組織完備的跑狗塲。</p>
<p>一星期中除了星期五（？）之外。每天晚上有盛會的。最是以驚人的。跑狗塲跑道的四圍。都築階級式的看台。可以容納觀衆｜賭客｜拾餘萬之多。輸贏的怎麽大。亦非我們所能想像得到。其貽害於社會的深且巨。由此可知。</p>
<p>無論什麽東西。在剛發明時。總不免粗製濫造的。經過了多次的試騐。和多次的改良。纔能滿意。［跑狗］亦不能逃出例外。</p>
<p>［跑狗］粗具典型時。其賭法拿活的兎子放縱於前。經狗看見了。就追逐起來。依次序的先後分勝負。但是活兎奔走。没有定程。而且心慌膽怯。易爲羣狗捉到。雜亂無章。公證人不能下精確的評判。久而久之。方始發明電兎。開電兎的可以隨心所欲。羣狗［想吃天鵝肉］而不能抓到手。并且永遠［不識廬山眞面目］。天天在跑道上兜圈子。拆不穿西洋鏡。科學家說［狗的視覺最靈］。我有些疑感。</p>
<p>除了英國之外。最有［狗迷］的要算美國。</p>
<p>八年前，［跑狗］就隨了歐風美雨。傳染到吾們貴中國的上海。</p>
<p>當明園新開幕的幾天晚上。本市的民衆。像煞遇到什麽大典一般。狠詫異地說··［外國人眞正有本領。［跑狗］可以做輸贏的］。大家爲了好奇心所驅使。成羣合隊地去觀光。各式各樣的汽車。從外擺渡橋起。尾巴接尾巴地一直到華德路。路旁的億萬居民。扶老携少。</p>
<p>等於自殺！士英作</p>
<p>手舞足蹈。看空前的𤍠鬧。唉。歷年以來。狠有許多吞烟，上吊，服安神片，投黃浦的狗迷同胞們。他們的［自殺心］。就是胚胎於當年的［好奇心］。</p>
<p>狗票分獨贏和位置兩種。有二元一張的。有五元一張的有十元一張的。有二十五元一張的。此外還有雙獨贏票和摇彩票。</p>
<p>跑狗場抽的佣金有百分之十一之多。我有一個朋友是研究經濟學的。他說［假使我們帶了一百塊袁頭。到跑狗場去。即使没有輸贏。經過他們十餘次的抽取佣金。我們的錢。就要化爲烏有。我深深地味味他說的話。覺得非常有理。而且令人可驚可駭。</p>
<p>跑狗塲的狗。可以大别爲澳洲種和英國種。前者比後者强壯而善跑。所以上海跑狗塲的狗。都從澳洲採辦來的。現在海關禁止跑狗入口。跑狗塲的當軸。深恐年深月久。運來的狗不免快要老死了。主角絶種。怎麽可以維持下去。當然要［未雨綢繆］。就拿比較老些的狗配起雌雄來。生殖小狗。生下的狗。跑狗場和狗主人平均分派。跑狗塲又可以拿重金賣出。獲利無窮。小狗出世後十幾個月。就可以出塲比賽。我想數十年後。上海要變成［狗世界］哩。</p>
<p>跑狗場的老板·在外洋聘請［超等名角］時。｜採購跑狗｜所付的原價。秘而不宣。我們局外人無從打聽出來。一經運到上海。就身價十倍。每頭價格自幾百元起至幾千元不等。我們中國人也情願出重價買來。規定繼續由跑狗塲代爲豢養。狗主人按月須貼狗膳費洋二十元。</p>
<p>狗主人的所以不惜耗費巨額金錢買一頭狗。和地産商的買辦房地産。抱有同一目的。地産商可以收租金。狗主人可以得［趟頭錢］。（扣去十分之一酬謝狗夫）趟頭錢也分幾等。以狗的優劣爲凖。大槪有百元，一百十元，一百二十元，一百三十元，一百四十元，一百五十元，及一百六十元，共七種。譬如頭狗得一百元。則二狗得五十元。三狗得三十元。餘可依此類推。鴻運高照的狗主人。每星期有進益。好像比什麽産業都有出息。命運不好的。在幾個月中。無分文可得。然而膳費一層。跑狗塲决不容他拖欠。數目也决不减少。仍是按月二十元。</p>
<p>最倒霉的。費的昂貴得好比討了一個姨太太同樣的代價。剛買了一頭狗。不幸牠害起病來。延請狗醫診治。一年半載中不能出塲與賽。醫費膳費兩不可缺。其至於病死了。或染疫死了。狗主人的産業。絲毫没有保障的。這種危險性。較做投機生意還要厲害。</p>
<p>［跑狗］在中國已有七八年的歷史。第一批運來的狗。大都老了。狠少有可能繼續着在跑狗塲幹牠的逐兎生活。以爲狗主人生利。自然要受淘汰。照例，跑狗塲當軸用書面通知狗主人。限於某月某日前領回。你若是延遲些。跑狗場就要拿這隻老狗執行死刑｜槍斃｜。</p>
<p>少壯的跑狗。［穿頭］好。（註··這是狗迷通用的成語）什麽都好。他們都愛非凡。一到老了。就當牠是眼中釘。［狗呀］。［狗呀］。［你一生奔走。所爲何事。靠你造洋房的。坐汽車的。盡是碧眼兒。［人老珠黃不值錢］。他們决不好報你。我們中國人給你害死的。不知有多少。所以你也没有好收塲］。</p>
<p>還有一件狠别緻的事。不妨附帶說說。</p>
<p>跑狗的性情。有和順的。也有暴燥的。和順的狗。只管安分守己地追逐電兎。暴燥的狗。在中途喜和他狗打架。跑狗場的董事會。居然於這次狗賽畢後。舉行圓桌會議。一度討論之後。下諭停止那［打狗］執行職務幾個月或幾星期。若是那狗下次出賽。不改牠的本來面目。常被議决開除。拿整千整百的大洋鈿。換一位狗伯伯回來。在我們窮措大看來。多麽心痛。奉勸同胞們。有了錢什麽都可以幹。開店舖。辦實業。没有一處没有光榮的。何必耗巨額金錢。去做狗主人。完全在洋人鼻息之下。博取蠅頭小利。而且狗主人是着實難做的。靠這種産業致富的。能有幾個。</p>
<h3>樓下和樓下</h3>
<p>— 小松江</p>
<p>踏進理髪店，老閭灣着腰滿堆了笑臉說··［樓上請］。</p>
<p>樓下的六個座位，已被捷頭者佔有了；我毫不在意的踏上樓梯，正見兩條赤裸的腿在眼前一晃。［樓上女客座］我頓時記憶起來，脚步同時停住了，而老闆的識趣的腦袋却又開口··［先生，樓上請］。</p>
<p>我似乎義不容辭，昂然的踏上樓去。我想［樓上女客］在營業有關的時候，也可特别通融，中國人的做生意是怪圓滑的。</p>
<p>樓上已先有兩位女客，一位剛坐下去的正擱起她的兩條赤裸的腿，我也在旁邊的一個座位坐了下來。</p>
<p>［剪髪？］白衣的理髪師（？）問我。我點點頭。</p>
<p>數分鐘後，他把另一面鏡子照腦後的頭髪給我看。</p>
<p>再薄一點］，我對於頭髪的式樣是並不研究，因爲生性懶於上理髪館，剪髪時總要短一點。</p>
<p>［薄了要短的！］他似乎怪我不識貨他剪髪的技術。</p>
<p>［是要短啊！］我也努氣地回答他。</p>
<p>又是幾分鐘粗手粗脚的工作，修面End，他的臉老是綳得緊緊地没有一條縫，這時候老闆的［先生，樓上請］又送進我的耳管。</p>
<p>我付了錢，一望擱起兩條赤裸的腿的女客，那理髪師（？）還没有動剪刀。</p>
<p>我下樓去，那位先生興怱怱地上來。</p>
<p>［老闆在營業上，樓上和樓下是一樣的；伙計在技術上，樓上和樓下却有這末大的分别］。我寫這稿子時還没有明白其中的所以然。</p>
<p>戲劇</p>
<h3>戰爭與和平（六）（三）（四幕劇）　　寫在劇的後面</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>現在，這個劇本到底陸續的寫完了。讀者諸君｜此刻我心頭有着無可形容的輕决。當然，我以最大的努力來寫作這一劇本，自首至尾，我都灌注了全部的𤍠情。</p>
<p>如今，連我自己也不敢相信自己的能力，不過，到底將它寫完了。</p>
<p>當然，這得感謝這偉大的時代；半殖民地的中國居然被侵略到如此地步，。更使我們興奮的，便是我們這般年紀的青年們，正生活在這偉大的轉換之前夜。第一次大戰在我們眼前開始和結束，現在又是新的屠殺馬上展開。在這時代中，我爲什麽不應當使盡精力來寫作這一劇本呢？</p>
<p>如此，這［戰爭與和平］，未嘗不是一斷歷史的記載了。而且這裏所寫的差不多都是眞實的材料，這是可以負責告訴讀者諸君的。純粹的紀錄戲劇或是報告戲劇，在目前的中國正是非常需要，可惜在這裏並没有完全採用上述的各種形式。</p>
<p>不過這一回事在中國的國史上佔了最重要的一頁，乃是無可否認的了。正因爲如此，當我在寫作中的時候，友人們對於我責任上的鼓勵和督責，也特别起勁。這使我感覺舞限的惶悚。同時還有不認識的朋友們來函勉慰，均得在此一併道謝！至於本刋編者能以如許寳貴之篇幅給我發表，更應當竭誠感謝！</p>
<p>此外關於劇的本身，還要附帶的說明一些。</p>
<p>這一劇本没有自首的主人翁，我以爲這樣對於這一事件可以比較活潑的描寫，不致於受着故事的拘束。同時我也不想以幾個典型人物來代表這一事件。</p>
<p>爲了演出的方便，我企圖每一幕都可單獨的存在。</p>
<p>至於這一劇本如整個的搬上舞臺，在中國目前的情形之中，當然有不少困難。這不僅是說人數太多難於導演，事實上也需要有一個很大的舞臺。然而對於場面的支配，我自同寫得相當精細。</p>
<p>至於這次印刷上的錯誤之多，那簡直是多至不勝更正。將來如有印成單行本之可能，當仔細的校正修改。</p>
<p>最後，希望得着從事戲劇或文學的友人以及高貴的讀者們嚴格的批判，謹此等待。（完）</p>

<h3>中國電影藝人訪問記（十九）（續昨）</h3>
<p>— 沙基</p>
<p>（八）［殘春］導演張石川（下）</p>
<p>在上面的那些話中，我們知道張先生是很𤍠心體育的。據程步高先生在旁加以解釋；［這是說一般的提高運動成績的意思。］老實說，從老百姓身上拿出大批金錢來養育健兒，未嘗不是替國家爭了很大的面子，譬如劉長春短跑大家到今年仍是代表遼寗（即是［滿洲國］的奉天啊！）而平等了遠東運動會的記錄，何等堂皇。其後我又問道；</p>
<p>［張先生對於目前的中國電影有什麽意見？］</p>
<p>［很簡單的］，他說；［目前的中國電影，主要的是要抓住觀衆，有了觀衆才能灌輸。就是有了好的意識，也得有人來看。如不來看，仍是無益······］</p>
<p>［哼，好極，好極。······那末張先生對於自己的作品有什麽意見？］</p>
<p>］我是一個老飯桶］，他太客氣了。［我的業務上很忙，本來不應當導演的。可是爲了公司的營業，爲了使公司能夠發達，所以也得來導演片子。老實說，我對於自己的作品，都不滿意。差不多每一個出品，我祗看一遍，連二次也不想看。···不過這也有許多原因，最主要的是我的作品都是很快的製作成功的。對於公司方面，出品太慢，當然没有好處，只有愈快愈好，才能夠維持成本。······我覺得一部片子做上一年二年，並不見得就有十倍二十倍的成績。］</p>
<p>這都是内行話。此時程步高先生又來解釋了。</p>
<p>［其實作品的慢，並不是一定是導演的慢，譬如一個佈景拍好，總要過一個多星期才能拍第二個佈景。這樣一個月只能拍三個佈景。假使說一個戲有二十個佈景，那般就得拍七個月。外景不算，還得有剪接修改的工夫。大槪一部默片，自FirstCamera到LastCut，工作時間約二百個小時。······］</p>
<p>最後我又想到張先生曾經去江西拍勦共影片，對於江西的實際情形，定有不少心得。於是我問；</p>
<p>［先生到江西去了幾次，可不可以告訴我們一些關於你個人的意見？］</p>
<p>［我到江西去，因爲是蔣總司令需要拍有聲電影，所以去帮帮忙。······至於關於勦匪的事，我想這個問題太大，我不想說什麽。······］</p>
<p>我們的談話就在這裏終止，因爲他很忙，所以不便多問。不過在這簡短的談話中，我們很可以對他有着相當的了解。（八）完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評［離恨天］　　上海映</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>我們對於小公司的出品，因其資本拮据，人材缺乏，常存着一種寛恕的主見，甚至於不惜降低水準來給它適當的評價。這一種態度未嘗不是對於小公司存着高度的厚望，企圖鼓勵他們努力進展。但是這决不是說對於小公司無條件的原宥，至少對於作者的意識形態，我們必須給以十分正確的評價。假使我們對於作者庸俗的選擇題材而構成不通的故事，亦不予以嚴格的指斥，那就等於成了他們的俘虜，甚至於成了殺人的帮兇。因此，我們對於演出技巧可因其客觀的事實而加以某種程度之寛恕，但對於内容的檢討，仍須固執着主觀的見解。</p>
<p>看了孤星公司的［離恨天］，使我先有了如上的意見。事實是如此，我們對於［離恨天］作者諸君的努力，决不能輕易忽視。譬如因着燈光不夠使用而不得不拍太陽光。誰也知道，因此而影響作品的完美，乃是必然的事實。尤其是祗使幾塊反光板居然能有如此清晰的攝影，更值得我們欽佩攝影師的成功。同時，不幸遇着天刮大風，佈景中的小道具不免吹動，很明顯的也可看出資本拮据的缺憾。對於這些，我們能不相當的寛容嗎？至於戰爭的場面，爲了省錢也不能不剪用舊片插入。</p>
<p>然而我們的寛容也祗能做到如此地步，對於内容的估價，我們是再也不能降低水準的了。雖然是小公司的出品，也得以同一的凖繩來正確的測量，有如批評所謂大公司出品完全一樣。也許有人說，因着資本的不足，不能得着健全的人材。然而所謂健全的人材，决不全是天才啊。何况，所謂天才者也不見得對於題材的處理就必然的正確。托爾斯泰或巴爾薩克都是天才的創作者，但是他們的意識形態常曹受後人嚴格的反對。</p>
<p>所以要提出托爾斯泰和巴爾薩克來，爲的是他們都是最好的寫實主義者。在電影上所描寫的，我們所要求的是［眞實］。更進一步的我們要在今日的［眞］中看到明日的［眞］。但是［一離恨天］的作者却拚命的在傳奇的故事翻觔斗。雖然編劇者很自信的將故事寫得很曲折，但正因爲不通的曲折更顯出故事的離奇。</p>
<p>一個師長的女兒會無緣無故的愛上一個馬夫，（據說明盡和字幕上都寫着［差馬長］。這種奇怪而不通的官名，眞是第一次看見。）這種事，只有在抛繡球之類的京戲中方會有王寳川和薛平貴那班不倫不類的人物。於是師長小姐便不願嫁給堂皇的參謀，而所謂交際花者也會革命起來。（不過在這裏編劇者頗有解釋，說是爲了報復之仇。其勉强可知。）到後來惡貫滿盈的的師長給另一馬夫殺掉，而不知道喊衛隊，小姐到尼菴出家，又謀長亦於北伐軍勝利之後而大發天良的自殺。結果所謂［差馬長］者和交際花團圓。</p>
<p>國民革命軍在北伐的當時，因着人民的𤍠烈擁戴，在反軍閥的意義上，確是光榮的記載。直到現在，以反軍閥爲影片的主題，仍有其重大的意義。但是作者因爲了解的不夠，却没有方法來實踐這種題材，而祇能庸俗的附會一個不通的傳奇。何况作品本身原是以戀愛爲經，而以國民革命爲緯。因此，果報，天理，良心，所謂看破紅塵，出家或是自殺，而得意的成功了這離恨之天。</p>
<p>至於導演的不高明，更是明顯。舉例說；參謀長結婚之夜，居然會翁媳同至交際花處，而字幕上却說結婚已是三四天以前的事了。又是小姐在衆目之下，盜蓋師長的印以救情人，有了老半天，而師長和交際花却不過是從花廳走進臥室。演員也是不夠的，勉强得很。至於字幕却更多而不通。</p>
<p>據友人說，這是以前的作品，所以不能在這轉變之中得着任何反映。果然如此，那末我們希望作者諸君趕快認清時代的潮流，不要甘居人後。</p>
<h3>評［晨曦］　　北京映</h3>
<p>— 瑜</p>
<p>在國産影片年來傾向於新的作風之後，非但各大公司對於素來戀愛影片的製片方針的轉變，卽小公司也漸漸的走上了這新的路綫了。</p>
<p>因此，對於這部以比［野玟瑰］更好相號召的［晨曦］，我們是抱着很大的𤍠心去看的。</p>
<p>然而，這部影片雖然比過夫的小公司片子是好得多，而整個的說，却給我們很失望了。</p>
<p>以農村底石鑛工人的抗日反帝爲題材，本來正是極好的，可是編劇者竟把它寫成一個戀愛高於一切，甚至把阿祥寫成因阿薇的驅使而毅然與敵抗戰。阿薇呢，也許是要把她寫成所謂比［野玟瑰］更潑辣更勇敢的緣故，你看，當她聽到後山在肉搏的時候，她是那末勇敢的手無寸鐵走上在正肉搏的戰塲。而何三保，在這片裡是一個十足的英雄，他發號令，出通告··［只准明槍交戰，不准暗箭殺人。］更同樣的手無寸鐵往所謂［肉搏］的地方救助阿祥，這是多麽一個理想的英雄啊！雖然，寫礦工的以自己的力量，如子彈用完時，他們乃石擲敵人，以鐵鍋敲碎塞進槍洞中當子彈用，這是可取的，但使人迷信一個英雄，而對於自身的責任卸却，却是極失敗的。</p>
<p>結尾，說明阿祥是因爲要求得阿薇的諒解和愛情而抗敵，把整個的抗日反帝戰爭的重大意義；完全抹煞凈盡。</p>
<p>但那些爲守土而戰死的鬭士呢，我們一個鏡頭也没有看到。</p>
<p>導演，在經濟缺乏的小公司中，一般的說，是頗能過得去的。不過，有許多地方太簡略了，譬如··阿祥看見一隻兎時，一個鏡頭只是極長的拍阿祥一個人，直至開槍後走到兎死的地方才看見。三保和獅猛鬭時，一看就知道是人假裝的。雖有一些是剪外國野獸片，但一點也不覺得緊張。阿祥在家裏穿一雙新鞋之後，還没有走開一步，接一個鏡頭却已在另外一間屋子的門前了。何三保和阿薇溪邊談情之後回去時，鏡頭前竟多了一個人頭，假如說，這人頭是阿祥的，而阿祥又分明是躱在樹後。三保殺死敵人之後，卽抱住受傷的阿祥不放手，是否敵人都已殺光了，這是來［肉搏］的只有一個人？其餘的小毛病及動作上下鏡頭不連接還很多呢？</p>
<p>攝影也許是因爲經濟能力的關係係以副片攝製，所以，有許多畫面正和電景一樣白。特别是演員的面上，有許多只看着白的臉，黑的眼，嘴唇和頭髪，黑夜，也拍成比白晝還要明亮。</p>
<p>佈景有許多很不錯。說明有兩三張描寫得太［深奥］了，使人看不懂它的意思。</p>
<p>演員的表情與動作，飾阿薇的王飛娟，動作絶不像一個天眞活潑的［野薔薇］，表情也不自然，阿祥的王春元，毫無表情。倒是何三保的張雨亭却演得不錯，雖然有許多太過火和太慢。臨時演員有許多表情使得觀衆莫名其妙，自然，導演是應該負這責任的。</p>
<p>總之，在小公司中，這張片子是比較進步的，我們希望他們以後再努力製作較完善和進步的作品出來。</p>

<h3>盛筵難再DinneratEight（五）</h3>
<p>— 馬騰</p>
<p>那個侍女仃娜在旁邊替吉蒂穿鞋，她亦看著她主婦手上的鑲大金鋼鑽的鐲子，那正是她所朝夕想望的東西。她替吉蒂穿上鞋就退出去了。派卡德繼續著說道；［你還管他們什麽喬敦，什麽紐約做什麽？我們反正就要到華盛頓去的。總統已經來請過我。你說做個閣員夫人好不好？］吉蒂道；［我不在乎。我不去那個牧塲。女童子軍給奬呀，戰士兒女會的茶會呀，白宮草地上的打球呀。嚇，我去做那些事！你去華盛頓吧，我耽在這裡。］她說完了，嘴唇一撇，自己笑了一下。</p>
<p>派卡德看見她那一笑，心裡起了疑心，他怒氣冲冲地問道；［你這是什麽道理？］吉蒂狂笑着道；［你想我一天到晚耽在家裡看著這個鐲子嗎。哈哈，大傻瓜！你當著你在那兒算計人家錢財的時候，我在家裡靜等著爸爸回來嗎？］派卡德道；［你······你······你這算什麽？］吉蒂故意逗著他道；［你不喜歡吧？你非計人家的錢財，人家不會算計你的媳婦的嗎？］想卡德眼睛裡冒火道；［誰？你說！］吉蒂慢慢地用粉撲擦著她的鼻子，冷冷地說道；［你派知道嗎？］吉蒂這樣挑逗著他，弄得他暴躁如雷。他將婷娜喊了進來，問她什麽人來過的。可是婷娜眼睛看著她主婦手上的金鋼鑽鐲子，以爲這回一定可以到手的了。她帮著她的主婦，辯護著没有别的男人來過。</p>
<p>派卡德問不出什麽清頭，就打發婷娜走了。他氣喘喘地對著吉蒂道；［我可以休掉你，把你趕出去，一個錢亦不給你！］吉蒂笑道；［你爲什麽休我，你有什麽憑據？］派卡德道；［我可以尋出憑據來的，我可以僱幾個偵探跟著你。我可以將他致之死命。我可以把你摔出去。］吉蒂還是不在乎似的道；［好吧。你反我摔出去吧。但是你没有摔我出去之前，還要多想幾想。你的事情，我不用僱偵探，我知道的很多！］派卡德道；［你知道什麽？］吉蒂道；［我知道什麽？你不是要到華盛頓去嗎？你不是要進政界作偉人嗎？好啦，我亦憧得政治。你那些舞弊欺詐的勾當，我全都知道。我雖則不願意聽，但我全聽見了。原來那種卑鄙齷齪的手段，骯髒躐蹋的行爲，就呌做政治。哈哈，讓我把這些政治宣佈出來，看你這般政客，還談不談政治！］她說完了，格格笑個不休。</p>
<p>派卡德低著頭踱來踱去，咬了牙齒駡道；［你這心毒如蛇的東西！我差不多從陰溝裡提了你起來，這就你報我的恩！我們的情義就此一刀兩斷！我今天和你到喬敦那裡去，是因爲芬克力夫在那裡。明天起，我們分手！］吉蒂道；［不，還早著呢。我現在要你怎樣就怎樣，你不敢說半個不字。第一樣······］她聲音突然地抖着，說出一篇大道理來。（未完）</p>

<h3>The Recovery of Funing County After a Night of Fierce Fighting. Dou Xizhe's Troops Were the First to Enter the City. Remnants of the Bandits Fled Towards Taitouying. Funing City Was Completely Looted by the Bandits. Local Gentry Formed a Maintenance Committee.</h3>
<p>Changli: Funing was retaken at 7:30 AM on the 5th. The 11th Company of Dou Xizhe's troops was the first to enter the city. At 9:00 PM on the 4th, the bandits attempted a counterattack but were met with a head-on assault. A fierce battle ensued throughout the night. By dawn, the bandits had suffered over half casualties, causing their overall morale to waver. The police force's morale, on the other hand, surged, and they attacked with vigor. Finally, at 7:30 AM on the 5th, they bravely stormed through the South Gate. Most of the over 2,000 bandits were killed under the heavy artillery fire. A small number escaped through the North Gate towards Liu's troops' position. After Dou's troops entered the city, they immediately conducted a search to prevent future troubles. Zhou's troops also arrived shortly after and are currently pursuing the remaining bandits. The Luan River East issue has thus come to an end. The reporter left Changli at 8:00 AM to inspect Funing City. (Special Dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>Changli: After the recovery of Funing, the reporter immediately rushed to inspect it, arriving in Funing at noon. Funing had been occupied by the bandits for over a month and has now been completely looted. Our security forces and the bandits engaged in a fierce battle from the night of the 4th to the morning of the 5th. After dawn, the bandits began to flee from the northwest. Our Dou Xizhe's police force and the 11th Company were the first to enter the city at 7:00 AM. Dou Xizhe also entered the city with them. At that time, the city was in a state of chaos. After entering the city, Dou immediately assigned his troops to garrison different areas and ordered Xia Chengen, a local gentry member, to organize a local maintenance committee to oversee temporary local affairs. Zhang Xiguang entered the city at noon to inspect everything and transferred Zhou Yuying's troops to garrison the city. Dou's troops, having achieved the initial victory, were ordered to return to their original defense positions. The reporter toured the city for a week and found that none of the houses were intact. The county government was completely destroyed. The corpses of the bandits were scattered everywhere, a truly horrific sight. The bandits' defense works in the four city gates still remained. Zhang Xiguang returned to Changli in the afternoon. Before leaving, he told the reporter that the Funing bandits had been scattered and that the Luan River East issue could be considered resolved. Currently, Dou's troops are stationed outside the city, and Zhou's troops are stationed inside the city. He himself will return to Tianjin in a few days to report everything to the provincial government. It is reported that the fleeing bandits have retreated towards Taitouying. Also, Dou's troops seized over sixty bandit guns, over a hundred horses, and one flag of Commander Zhang Kuiyuan. (Special Dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Funing County has been retaken on the morning of the 5th after being surrounded and shelled by the security forces for several days. The bandit forces suffered heavy casualties. Except for those who surrendered, the remaining bandits mostly fled towards the northwest. The security forces have entered the city to announce peace to the people. The city has suffered severe damage, and corpses are scattered everywhere. The local people are awaiting relief. The Luan River East bandit disaster, which has been delayed for several months, has now been resolved. (Special Dispatch, 5th)</p>
<h3>Liu and Tang's Troops in a Standoff. Dushi's Farmlands Turned into Pastures. Chicheng's Houses Turned into Fuel.</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The conflict between Liu and Tang is still difficult to resolve in the short term. Tang has over a thousand bandits attacking the city, while Liu has built defenses over the past four months. Dushi's farmlands have been turned into pastures, and Chicheng's houses have been turned into fuel. (Special Dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Liu Guitang's wife was carrying a large amount of cash. She set off from Chicheng a few days ago, intending to go to Tianjin via Beiping. However, she was robbed by bandits somewhere along the way, and her whereabouts are currently unknown. (Special Dispatch, 5th)</p>
<h3>Sun's Troops' Defense Area Issue. Ge Jingen is Consulting with Yan.</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Sun Dianying has requested to have the Wuyuan and Linhe areas of Suiyuan, and the Pingluo area of Ningxia as his troops' defense areas. The authorities believe that this matter needs to be discussed with Yan. Ge Jingen has been sent to Jin to meet and negotiate. Ge will return to Beiping within the next few days to report. Also, the military authorities here originally intended to ask Huang Shaoxiong to go to Jin after inspecting Inner Mongolia, but Huang's stay in Sui has caused the original plan to be cancelled. (Special Dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Sun Dianying's representative, Hu Jiesan, went to Jiangxi this afternoon to meet with Jiang, requesting instructions on Sun's troops' westward advance. (Telegraph, 5th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Pingfang received a joint appeal from Ma Lin, Chairman of Qinghai, and various provincial committee members, calling for a halt to Sun's troops' westward advance via telegram, expressing his determination to fight for it even at the cost of his position. (Special Dispatch, 5th)</p>
<h3>The Completion of the Duolun Japanese Airfield.</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The airfield built by the Japanese in Duolun has been completed. There are currently two Japanese military reconnaissance aircraft stationed at the airfield, as well as a Japanese cavalry platoon to protect the airfield. It is reported that the aircraft often flies to Mongolian territories and travels between Jinzhou and Duolun. (Special Dispatch, 5th)</p>
<h3>The Negotiation Policy for the Ping-Shen Railway Traffic Issue Has Been Determined. The Principle is to Avoid Political Involvement. Okamura is Coming to Beiping Today to Discuss and Decide with Our Authorities.</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Yin Tong said that for the Ping-Shen railway traffic matter, our side has jointly decided on a principle by the Political Reorganization Committee, the Ministry of Railways, and the Beining Railway Bureau to resolve the traffic arrangements. If it conforms to this principle, we can negotiate. If it conflicts, there is no way to negotiate. There are currently no specific results. The Ministry of Railways has sent personnel north to negotiate the Ping-Shen railway traffic matter. (Special Dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding the issues of Ping-Shen railway traffic, customs, and postal services at various passes of the Great Wall, the Kwantung Army has decided to negotiate directly with the North China authorities. It has sent Deputy Chief of Staff Okamura, who is scheduled to arrive in Beiping by plane from Changchun tomorrow to discuss everything with Huang. It is rumored that Japanese Ambassador Arima also bears some responsibility for negotiating with us, but this is not true. Regarding the measures set by our side for the Ping-Shen railway traffic matter, the principle is to avoid political issues. It is heard that in private talks between China and Japan, agreement was reached on the following measures: the name of the railway traffic will still belong to both China and Japan. The South Manchuria Railway will establish a transit company at a suitable location so that the name of the puppet Fengshan Railway will not enter Shanhaiguan after the Ping-Shen railway traffic opens. The South Manchuria Railway Company sent a representative to Beiping last month for informal negotiations. (Special Dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) There are four difficulties in the Beining Railway traffic matter: (1) Our side insists that Beining Railway trains go directly to Shenyang. (2) The Japanese side has not yet agreed to protect the safety of train operations in the section outside Shanhaiguan and that the revenue from vehicles in the section outside Shanhaiguan will belong to our side. (3) Our side insists that vehicles in the section outside Shanhaiguan cannot be driven to Beiping. (4) No international trains will be opened during peacetime. If the Japanese side's opinions are close to these four issues, we can negotiate. Xia Guangyu, Counselor of the Ministry of Railways, will arrive in Beiping tonight to discuss the Ping-Shen railway traffic matter with Yin Tong. (Special Dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yin Tong visited Japanese Ambassador Arima and Military Attaché Shibayama this afternoon. Regarding the postal rights in the Yuguan area, the Manchukuo post office has been established in Yuguan City in fact, and the puppet national tax bureau in Yuguan is also difficult to remove, because the Japanese side uses the excuse that the area is the border of the puppet state. Yin Tong will meet with Military Attaché Shibayama tonight and plans to return to Tianjin tomorrow morning. (Special Dispatch, 5th)</p>
<h3>Prince De and Others Wait Respectfully for Huang and Zhao at the Temple. They Originally Intended to Send a Cavalry to Welcome Them, but Huang and Zhao Declined Humbly. When Huang and Zhao Go North, Fu Will Send Troops to Escort Them. The Mongolian Army Stationed at Bailingmiao Has Been Completely Transferred to Tianchi. The Princes Respect the Central Government's Intentions. It Seems That the Obstructionists Are Inner Mongolian Youths.</h3>
<p>Bailingmiao: Prince De, Prince Xiong, Prince Yun, and the Panchen Lama planned to send eight cars and a hundred Mongolian cavalrymen to Suiyuan to welcome Huang and Zhao. Huang and Zhao immediately replied by telegram, stating that Fu Zuoyi would send troops to escort them when they went to Bailingmiao, and there was no need to send a welcoming party. In order to avoid causing misunderstandings, Prince De transferred all the troops from Bailingmiao to Tianchi, leaving no soldiers or guns at the temple. More than seventy armed Mongolian youths also went to Tianchi. (Special Dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>Bailingmiao: A certain Mongolian prince said that the Mongolian request for autonomy this time is a political revolution. He hopes that when Fu sends troops to escort Huang and Zhao, they will not pass through Daqing Mountain, because the Mongolians have always had a poor impression of the Han soldiers. (Special Dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>Guihua: Prince Yun and Prince De of Bailingmiao specially sent people to Suiyuan to purchase food and hire famous chefs in order to entertain the Central Government's inspection envoys to Inner Mongolia and their entourage. The fact that Princes Yun and De are so attentive to the daily life and diet of Huang, Zhao, and their party shows a glimpse of their inner loyalty. (Special Dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>Guihua: Prince De specially sent Wu Xixian as a representative to Suiyuan from Bailingmiao to welcome Huang and Zhao to guide them. Wu visited Huang at 10:00 AM on the 4th and said that Prince De had a very good meeting with Li Songfeng and others and was eager to have them come as soon as possible to ask for instructions. He also stated that the reason for the proposed Inner Mongolian autonomy was due to foreign invasion and pressure, and they needed to unite to resist, so it was definitely not comparable to a separatist movement. The rumors that there was a certain background were absolutely untrue. Huang replied, "I don't pay attention to the word 'background' at all. Frankly speaking, if Japan wants to seize Inner Mongolia, it doesn't need to contact the Inner Mongolian princes. Saying there is a background is using them. Japan will definitely not use Mongolian princes who can create benefits for the country. However, resisting foreign invasion is a matter of strength, not a matter of organization. We must first distinguish this clearly. I hope that the representatives can discuss practical issues and seek a permanent and harmonious solution within the scope that does not conflict with the central government and the provincial government. The central government is very willing to help the Mongolians to achieve autonomy. Please discuss all issues with Director Li and others at length first. I will come later." (Central News Agency Telegraph, 4th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Gui Yongqing, a member of the General Staff Headquarters' Border Affairs Group, wrote a letter saying that Prince De inquired about the true nature of Inner Mongolian autonomy. He replied that Inner Mongolian autonomy has no background and is subject to the instructions of the central government. (Central News Agency Telegraph, 5th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Panchen Lama is scheduled to depart from Bailingmiao in the late tenth lunar month, go to Beiping, and then go south to visit Lin, Wang, and others to report on the true nature of Inner Mongolian autonomy. (Special Dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Inner Mongolian autonomy issue has been delayed because the local authorities and the princes of the Inner Mongolian leagues and banners have different opinions. It is said that the governors of Chahar and Suiyuan both believe that the Mongolian people in their respective territories only account for one-tenth or two-tenths of the total population of the province, and their military strength is insufficient to resist foreign aggression. They agree in principle with the princes' proposal for autonomy, but advocate that autonomy should be implemented with the Mongolian banners as the unit, still subordinate to the provincial government. The Jin side also advocates this. However, the princes of the Inner Mongolian leagues and banners, such as Prince De, have not changed their proposal to form an autonomous government jointly. How to bring the two sides' opinions closer is a real problem. Li Songfeng and others were sent to Bailingmiao first to visit the princes, not only to convey the intentions of the central government but also to discuss this point. Before this point is resolved, Huang and Zhao are still difficult to set off. (Special Dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The central government originally planned to do its best to support the Inner Mongolian autonomy, but it must organize an autonomous committee, with the participation of the princes. There is no need to organize a government. It is heard that after Prince A mediated this matter, the princes have agreed to obey the central government's intentions on the non-establishment of a government, but the youth have not yet agreed. Currently, all the princes have gone to Tianchi to actively prepare everything. In the future, whether a committee is organized or not, its autonomous agency will be established there. Prince De's representative, Bao Yueqing, is scheduled to return to Suiyuan tomorrow to report to Prince De. Enke Batu came north to handle the affairs of the Political Reorganization Committee and has nothing to do with Mongolian affairs. (Special Dispatch, 5th)</p>
<h3>Ma Zhongying's Remnants Are Trapped in Hami, with Plans for a Counterattack.</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Dihua Telegraph: Ma Zhongying is leading his remnants, trapped in Hami, with the intention of retreating to Xingxingxia. The New 9th Division is stationed outside Yumen Pass, with tight defenses. Ma Bufang plans to go to Suizhou to inspect the defenses. (Special Dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Liu Wenlong and Sheng Shicai jointly telegraphed the central government and the authorities in Beiping, reporting that Ma Zhongying's rebel troops are preparing to counterattack Southern Xinjiang again, and the turmoil in the new province is resurfacing. (Special Dispatch, 5th)</p>
<h3>Arima Hosts a Banquet for Important Figures in Beiping.</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Arima will host a banquet tonight at the Japanese embassy for Huang Fu, He Yingqin, Yin Rugeng, Yin Tong, and other military and political officials of our government. (Special Dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yuan Liang will host a banquet for Japanese Ambassador Arima at the Summer Palace tomorrow afternoon. (Special Dispatch, 5th)</p>
<h3>A Eurasia Aircraft Crashed in Dacheng County.</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Eurasia Airlines Flight No. 8, which was traveling north from Beijing on the 4th, crashed in Dacheng County. No one was injured. (Special Dispatch, 5th)</p>
<h3>An Earthquake Occurred in Tianshui, and the Climate in Lanzhou is Extremely Cold.</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Lanzhou Telegraph: An earthquake suddenly occurred in Tianshui at approximately 4:00 PM on the 3rd. It lasted for approximately three minutes and then stopped. The losses were not significant. Lanzhou is extremely cold, with ice over a foot thick and snow that has not melted. Pedestrians are wearing heavy fur coats. (Special Dispatch, 5th)</p>
<h3>Luo Wen'gan Will Arrive in Tanggu Today.</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Luo Wen'gan telegraphed Hu Xianglin, President of the High Court, saying that he passed Nagasaki on the 4th and is expected to arrive in Tanggu on the 6th. The special train prepared by the provincial government will carry welcoming personnel to Tanggu at 11:00 PM on the 5th. The provincial government also telegraphed the Dagu Coastal Defense Headquarters, ordering it to send a gunboat to greet the ship if it cannot enter the port. (Special Dispatch, 5th)</p>
<h3>Li Jichun's Troops Are Under the Jurisdiction of the Hebei Provincial Government.</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) After Li Jichun was dismissed from his post, his two security brigades have been placed directly under the jurisdiction of the provincial government. Li himself resides in Tangshan. Feeling inconvenienced in many ways, he has secretly gone to Changchun. After a short stay, he will go to Dalian to stay temporarily. (Central News Agency Telegraph, 5th)</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Commends the Bandit Suppression Troops in Western Hubei.</h3>
<p>(Hankou) Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, in recognition of the efforts of the bandit suppression army in Western Hubei, has specially awarded a consolation fee of 50,000 yuan, which was handed over to Xu Yuanquan by He Chenjun to be distributed to the various troops. (Special Dispatch, 5th)</p>
<h3>The Sichuan Bandits' Counterattack Failed. He's Bandits Fled to Qianjiang.</h3>
<p>(Hankou) The 5,000 to 6,000 Sichuan bandits counterattacked Yongxingchang between Kaixian and Xuanhan. After being surrounded and suppressed by the Ma, Li, Cui, and Xu brigades, the bandits collapsed again. The government troops have advanced to Renhechang, Sanhuikou, and Yangzhuguan and are confronting the bandits. (Special Dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Changsha) Chen Quzhen telegraphed that He Long has fled to Qianjiang on the border of Sichuan and is being pursued. (Special Dispatch, 5th)</p>
<h3>The Bandit Situation in Jiangxi Province is Desperate, with Plans to Flee to Hunan.</h3>
<p>(Nanchang) The General Headquarters announced military news: since the defeat of the Pseudo-First Army in the major battle between Nancheng and Lichuan, the remaining bandits have harassed the area and suffered repeated defeats. Recently, various bandit troops have either been lying dormant or fleeing east and west. After fleeing to Pinghou on the 31st, the Pseudo-First Army Corps fled through Shanghangxu on the 4th to the vicinity of Xiaoshi. The Pseudo-Third Army is lying dormant in Longtiankeng and Zongchan. The Pseudo-Third Army Corps was originally in Xiaoshidongkou, but on the 4th, it fled to Xiaoshi Hejiazhuang and Hufang. The Pseudo-Seventh Army Corps Fang Shao's Ninth Division is still滞留在硝石以北. We are holding to the principle of稳扎稳打. Although there are no reports of victory, the longer we block them, the more the bandits will be weakened. (Special Dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Changsha) He Jian has stipulated that the military will be the main force in suppressing or intercepting large groups of bandits, and the local militias will be the main force in preventing and clearing bandits. (Special Dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The recent attempts by Jiangxi bandits to disturb Hunan have prompted Yang Xiji and other important figures from Guangdong residing in Hunan to send a telegram to Guangdong, requesting Chen Jitang and Li Zongren to increase troops to assist in the suppression. (Special Dispatch, 5th)</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Issues an Order to Reduce the Surtax on Land Tax and Urges the Collection of Import Duty on Foreign Rice.</h3>
<p>(Nanchang) Chiang has ordered the chairmen of the Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, Henan, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Hebei provinces and the mayor of Shanghai to (1) promptly report the surtax on land tax to the General Headquarters, strictly reduce it, and not exceed the amount stipulated by the Ministry of Finance; (2) prohibit the obstruction of rice purchases and transportation; (3) promptly report the collection of various rice taxes to the General Headquarters and strictly exempt them; (4) abolish all improper practices of grain merchants thoroughly,乙 establish reasonable expenses, and 丙督同督同 local chambers of commerce and rice grain trade associations to improve their organization and eliminate extra miscellaneous expenses.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The Bandit Suppression Movement</h3>
<p>— Heng</p>
<p>The bandit scourge today is even more severe than the roving bandits of the late Ming Dynasty. It has the deepest and greatest impact on the country's future. Therefore, the authorities have declared that internal pacification must come before external resistance. In the late Ming Dynasty, Zhang Xianzhong, Li Zicheng, and others started their rebellions simply because they were driven by hunger and cold, gathering to eat. They had no political ambitions and no intention of confronting the government. However, the rulers at the time were employing eunuchs and procrastinating, which allowed the roving bandits to grow stronger and destroy the Ming dynasty. The current situation of banditry is very different. The rural economy has been declining day by day, and the emerging industries cannot undertake the task of transforming the agricultural economy into a capitalist economy. Cities cannot absorb the surplus population in rural areas. Inland transportation is blocked, making it difficult to stimulate urban industries, export raw materials to the fullest extent possible, and absorb finished goods. As a result, all major cities are hubs for the transfer of imported goods, forming areas that absorb the surplus from rural areas. Adding to this the disasters of human affairs and the prevalence of natural disasters, the surplus population has no way out. Many resort to desperate measures, which has led to the current phenomenon.</p>
<p>The Red Bandit Rebellion in Jiangxi Province is more complex in its structure and content than Zhang and Li in the late Ming Dynasty. In recent years, the government has exhausted its efforts to quell the bandit scourge, hoping to lift the people out of poverty and establish peace and security for the country. This is what our people are praying for. Moreover, today's finances are at their most difficult point, and external troubles are multiplying, with strong neighbors seeking opportunities. Therefore, if the bandits are not suppressed, the finances will fall into a deeper quagmire. All construction, education, transportation, and industry will be out of the question, and resisting foreign aggression will be even more of an empty talk. Therefore, bandit suppression is indeed an urgent task for internal pacification, and it is something that our people should pay close attention to and fully recognize.</p>
<p>On his deathbed, Mr. Sun Yat-sen earnestly urged that in order to achieve the goal of completing the revolution, "we must awaken the masses." After the Kuomintang came to power, it has been doing its best to promote party doctrine. However, I am afraid that it has not yet penetrated deeply into the people, and the general public is still like a heap of loose sand. As a result, political difficulties are becoming more and more severe, and the Red Bandits are able to take advantage of the weaknesses of the general society and take advantage of the situation. Therefore, in the future bandit suppression, we must first awaken the masses to the accurate recognition of the Kuomintang and unite together. This is the most important point.</p>
<p>Recently, with the advance of the army, victory is of course expected. However, after the military issue comes to an end, we must pay attention to the restoration of local order and the regeneration of civil affairs. The key to this lies in the construction of politics and the establishment of economic organizations. Military victory alone does not seem to be enough to say that the whole task has been accomplished. Today's China, even in areas without Red Bandits wreaking havoc, people feel the pain of life. Therefore, political reform is what the whole country is eagerly hoping for, especially in bandit areas and those close to bandit areas. The government should assess the situation, weigh the priorities, and tailor local politics to the needs of the local people. As soon as the military operation is over, it should be able to set an example. All officials must be honest and capable in order to ensure the already won military victory. Economic construction must be started in order, and then the people will be able to live and work in peace and will not be taken advantage of by the Red Bandits again. The reason why the bandits incite the masses and disrupt society lies in taking advantage of the economic decline during this transitional period, which causes insecurity in life. They sow the narrow psychology of resentment among the general public, so they have been able to continue to support themselves until today, repeatedly exhausting the military to extend the crusade. I believe that it is not difficult to wipe out the bandits, but it is difficult to rebuild politics and revive the economy after the bandits are suppressed.</p>
<p>Now that people's intelligence is developing day by day, and the material temptations are also becoming more prosperous, the breakdown of the countryside causes all kinds of ominous omens to occur. If we cannot take the opportunity to draw salaries and eliminate the roots, then the military victory of bandit suppression will still be difficult to maintain. Therefore, at the beginning of bandit suppression, I sincerely hope that the government will devote more effort to solving political problems. In particular, it is necessary to relieve the people in the bandit areas of their suffering and cultivate their strength so that they will no longer be deceived by the bandits and will be able to contribute to resisting the bandits. Then, the merit of bandit suppression can be immortalized, and the people can live and work in peace.</p>
<h3>War Clouds Between Japan and Russia Loom Over Harbin, Causing Panic Among the People. Residents are Moving Elsewhere, and Shenyang and Changchun are Also Showing Signs of Unease. Japanese Aircraft Conduct Night Drills. Troops Continue to Move North.</h3>
<p>(Harbin) Talk of war between Japan and Russia has caused panic here. Some residents are selling all their possessions and moving elsewhere. Shenyang and Changchun are also showing the same trend, but not as much as Harbin. The biggest reason for the people's unease is that Japanese aircraft have been conducting night drills recently, Japanese troops have been moving towards Northern Manchuria, and the dispute over the Chinese Eastern Railway cannot be resolved. Although the Japanese authorities have repeatedly denied the rumors as unfounded, the panic in Harbin has increased rather than decreased, forcing the Japanese military authorities to issue a formal statement, stating that the troops moving north are all for the purpose of suppressing bandits. Regarding Russia's preparations for war, the statement said that although Russia has concentrated some troops and hundreds of aircraft on the Far Eastern border and is building fortifications on the border, this cannot be said to be Russia's preparation to invade "Manchukuo," because Soviet Russia is now pouring all its efforts into completing its Five-Year Plan. Therefore, Soviet Russia not only adopts a peaceful policy towards the Far East but also holds the same policy towards other aspects. As for "Manchukuo," it only wants to have equal management rights over the Chinese Eastern Railway to prevent future illegal incidents, such as the removal of Chinese Eastern Railway vehicles into Russian territory. "Manchukuo" only wants to maintain their rights. Its actions are also based on "Manchukuo" law and are not, as Russia claims, attempting to seize the Eastern Railway by force. Soviet Russian personnel deliberately spread the rumor that a Japanese-Russian war would break out and that victory would ultimately belong to Russia in order to arouse the courage of the Russian people.</p>
<p>This policy has made the people of Japan, Russia, and "Manchukuo" feel that the current environment is the same as before the outbreak of the Sino-Russian war in 1929. However, Japan, Russia, and "Manchukuo" are now doing their best to develop their own economies. Therefore, there is no reason for talk of war. Japan and Russia do have mutual suspicions about each other's policies. However, if Russia takes actions that endanger the peace of "Manchukuo," Japan will be forced to take firm measures to protect the safety of the entire Japan and "Manchukuo" in order to fulfill its obligations under the Japan-"Manchukuo" agreement.

<h3>Japan Sets Up an Airfield in the Pacific Mandated Islands, Drawing the Attention of the US Navy.</h3>
<p>(New York) American newspapers reported that Japan plans to set up an airfield on Saipan Island (transliteration) in the Pacific mandated islands. According to the Japanese side, its intention is to study meteorology and assist the island's fishermen. The US Navy is discussing this and is quite worried. (Havas Telegram, 4th)</p>
<h3>Trotsky Ridicules Japan's Arrogance; Soviet Russia is Not Comparable to the Imperial Era; Japan's Unchecked Ambition Will Ultimately Lead to Self-Destruction</h3>
<p>(Paris) Leon Trotsky, the anti-leadership figure of the Soviet Russian Communist Party, published an article in the local left-wing publication (Affaires报), ridiculing Japan's arrogance. He stated that Japan is encountering unprecedented difficulties in its domestic affairs, and therefore adopting a tough foreign policy to divert the people's attention. Japan, a small nation, once defeated the vast China in one fell swoop forty years ago, causing it to lose territory and cede land. Ten years later, it defeated the autocratic Russian people, causing their entire army to collapse. Japan's plan is fully outlined in the Tanaka Memorial of 1927. The Tanaka Memorial stated that Japan is in an invincible position, but it is not aware that although Japan gained much from the two victories mentioned above, Japan has not yet met the advanced countries in battle. Its so-called "invincible position" is merely an exaggeration and cannot be proven by facts. Japan's culture is already backward. Its victory over China is only because Chinese culture is even more behind Japan. As for the Imperial Russian army, although some say it was an invincible army, in reality, it was only capable of dealing with the barbaric peoples of the Caucasus and Central Asia, as well as the internally collapsing Poland and the Turkey that adopted a chieftain system. Victory over Imperial Russia is not enough to demonstrate the strength of Japan's military might. As for the two major wars that are precarious today, one is against the United States, and the other is against Soviet Russia. These two countries are not comparable to Russia in the imperial era or China in the Sino-Japanese War. Soviet Russia has always adopted a peaceful policy towards Japan, and sometimes feels that it is "overly compromising." Japan considers itself stronger than Russia, causing the Japanese people to become arrogant, which is the same as the Russian mentality of underestimating Japan before the Russo-Japanese War in 1904. This is extremely dangerous for peace. Once something happens, the Red Army will surely win. The strength of the Red Army lies not only in its well-equipped military but also in the reliability of the people's spirit. "The victory of the Soviet Russian Revolution is the driving force of the Russian people," etc. (Havas dispatch, 5th)</p>
<h3>Henderson Discusses Disarmament; Remains Optimistic About the Future; Davis Departs France for the United States</h3>
<p>(Paris) Henderson, Chairman of the Disarmament Conference, spoke to guests before departing from here to London today, saying that recent events have not diminished the need for a disarmament agreement. The general public is quite impatient with the slow progress, which is understandable, but it must be understood that gathering sixty-four countries together to try to agree on such a major event at the same time is truly the greatest experiment in history. Since the Disarmament Conference began, twenty countries have changed their governments, personnel, and policies. With such changes, slow progress is inevitable. Henderson will return to Paris next Tuesday and will likely visit French Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour before heading to Geneva on Wednesday. (Reuters, 4th)</p>

<h3>The U.S. Fleet Will Return to the Atlantic Next Summer for Comprehensive and Rigorous Training; Showing a Friendly Posture Towards Japan; Dispelling Its Fears of U.S.-Russian Rapprochement; Japan States That There Will Be No Change in Naval Plans</h3>
<p>(Washington) It was learned today from reliable sources that the U.S. President initially considered transferring the Pacific Fleet to patrol the Atlantic, and the intention did not involve the international situation. Later, Secretary of State Hull and other cabinet members thought that this move could show a friendly posture towards Japan, dispelling its fears of a possible U.S.-Russian rapprochement. Therefore, a quick decision was made and announced immediately. According to news from Tokyo, Japanese officials were delighted to hear the news and believed that this U.S. order would have a beneficial impact on Japanese public opinion. It is said that the President's intention was due to a recent review of naval operations, suspecting that its daily operational plans were not sufficient to provide comprehensive and rigorous training. In addition, the storms on the Atlantic are far more dangerous than those on the Pacific. It is feared that young soldiers living on the Pacific coast for a long time will become accustomed to comfort and will not be able to assume great responsibilities. Therefore, his initial intention was only to increase efficiency. Upon hearing the cabinet members' words, believing that it could show a friendly posture towards Japan and dispel Japanese concerns about the U.S. government's actions, he no longer hesitated about the additional naval operating expenses that this move would entail and decided immediately. (National Telegram, 4th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Some worry that the U.S. fleet's return from the Pacific to the Atlantic will affect Japan's second naval replenishment plan. However, the Japanese naval authorities stated that the U.S. fleet's return is the latest scheduled plan, but it cannot be said that the Pacific problem has been resolved by this. The second replenishment plan is firm and will not change. Moreover, the plan was originally to supplement the shortcomings of the London Treaty, so the movement of the navy of other countries will not change the plan at all. To say that the replenishment plan will be canceled due to the U.S. fleet's return is falling into the American trap. (Dentsu dispatch, 5th)</p>
<h3>Electrical Outage During Patriotic Movement in Austria; Nazi Party Implements Terrorist Plan; Smoke Bombs Thrown in Demonstrations; Two Hundred Students Arrested</h3>
<p>Vienna – After receiving detailed reports of disturbances from various provinces this morning, the Austrian government discovered a large-scale nationwide terrorist plan, allegedly carried out by the Austrian National Socialist Party. The plan involved acts of terror, such as throwing smoke bombs, destroying power plants, and rioting, at the sites where Chancellor Dollfuss and Prince Starhemberg, leader of the Heimwehr (Home Guard), were giving speeches. Although no deaths or injuries have been reported from the bombing, which began on Friday night and lasted until Sunday morning, it is believed that the National Socialist Party only wanted to demonstrate its capabilities, so that the people would understand what would happen once the party decided to use more violent weapons. Rumors have circulated that bombs were used in Klagenfurt, but this has not yet been officially confirmed. In Graz, a university was closed and two hundred students were arrested for throwing smoke bombs during a riot by National Socialist students. The most extreme act of terror was the attack in Klagenfurt, where Chancellor Dollfuss was giving a speech to a large gathering of people who had been called up to the front lines of the country. Suddenly, the generator was blown up, plunging the city of twenty-five thousand people into darkness. Then, within several yards of the hall where the Chancellor was speaking, someone threw a smoke bomb, causing the audience to panic and flee, forcing the Chancellor to stop his speech. A few minutes later, when the electric lights were still out, he had to finish his speech by torch and candlelight. The memory of the assassination attempt on the Chancellor earlier this month was still fresh in people's minds, and the audience was alarmed. Fortunately, an open attack was not part of the Nazi Party's plan, and no assassination attempt occurred. According to a subsequent investigation, the terrorists appeared to be extremely careful, not wanting to actually harm people or officials. While Klagenfurt was plunged into darkness, students rioted at the University of Graz, throwing smoke bombs to terrorize residents. Police arrested more than two hundred people, all National Socialist students. Prince Starhemberg was inspecting the Home Guard in Vöcklabruck when the entire city's lights suddenly went out and a bomb exploded near the parade ground. Starhemberg is a reactionary who opposes socialism and the National Socialist Party and supports the current government. He has repeatedly stated that most of the current riot plans in Austria are the work of the National Socialist Party, and there is no doubt that the terrorist act in Vöcklabruck was also carried out by the party. The only reported use of powerful explosives so far was in Pitschau, where rioters bombed the front door of the Home Guard leader's house, destroying the door, but the blast was minor and did not cause significant damage. Currently, Vienna police are closely cooperating with officials across the country. It is reported that demonstrations in major cities have been completely stopped as of this morning.

<h3>Conflict Between League of Nations High Commissioner and Danzig Senate; Ban on Newspaper Publication Deemed Unconstitutional</h3>
<p>Warsaw – Today, Rosting (Danish), the League of Nations High Commissioner stationed in Danzig, had a serious conflict with the National Socialist Senate of the Free City. The Senate had adopted various National Socialist measures, which the League of Nations High Commissioner considered to be in violation of the Danzig constitution and demanded their abolition, but the Senate ignored this, leading to the conflict. The point of dissatisfaction for the League of Nations High Commissioner was specifically the Senate's ban on a certain organ newspaper of the Socialist Party and a certain organ newspaper of the Central Party in the Free City. Rosting requested that the League of Nations Administrative Council convene an extraordinary meeting to determine whether the measures adopted by the Danzig Senate were in accordance with the Free City Constitution.

<h3>Italian Constitutional Reform; Dissolution of the Chamber of Deputies Will Be Implemented After Christmas; Giving Broad Legislative Power to Representatives of Agriculture, Industry, and Commerce</h3>
<p>Rome – It was learned today that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini plans to dissolve the lower house of parliament after Christmas as the first step in reforming Italy's legislative system. It is also heard that Mussolini wants to give broad legislative power to capitalists and laborers, making them fully responsible for controlling production. In practice, this is tantamount to abolishing the lower house and replacing it with representatives of agriculture, industry, and commerce. Observers of current affairs here believe that Mussolini's plan is the most radical constitutional reform in modern times, very close to the new Technocracy theory. The only difference is that the upper house will be retained to preserve the administrative power of political legislation. As far as industry and commerce are concerned, after Mussolini's new plan is implemented, Italy will become a Technocratic state. It is said that Mussolini has been actively preparing for this move in the past few years, making economic experts and industrial experts increasingly important in national life over the years. Now that preparations have reached a considerable stage, he has proposed its implementation. (National Telegram, 4th)</p>
<h3>Opportunities for Promotion for Young Military Officers</h3>

<h3>U.S. Gold Purchasing Policy Shows Preliminary Success; Exchange Rate Between Pound and Dollar Gradually Reaches the Equilibrium Line; Farmers Strike Against Grain Sales and Miners Strike; The Reconstruction Administration is Subject to Criticism from All Sides</h3>
<p>(Washington) Today, the U.S. government has been able to suppress the value of the gold dollar, bringing its exchange rate with the British pound to the true parity of the two currencies. Therefore, it firmly believes that the gold purchasing policy is sufficient to raise prices, so it is temporarily rejecting all other proposals to await the results of the gold purchasing policy. Today, the U.S. President stated that although foreign gold prices have fallen slightly, the purchase of gold will continue without interruption. It is expected that domestic prices will rise to the same extent as the gold dollar has fallen since the start of gold purchases, and the President is quite pleased with the current results. Therefore, he has rejected the price-raising plans proposed by the governors of Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, North Dakota, and South Dakota. According to the governors' requests, there should be an immediate large-scale expansion of currency to raise prices to alleviate farmers' difficulties, without waiting for the results of this compromise experiment. However, the President immediately told the governors that he did not want to change things lightly until the current plan had been fully and fairly tested, but he agreed to use all feasible methods to help raise prices. From this, it can be seen that the position taken by the U.S. President is currently between the inflationist faction and the conservative business faction. (National Telegram, 4th)</p>
<p>Des Moines - Reno, a member of the American Farmers' Holiday Association, telegraphed twenty-one key members of the Association today that if President Roosevelt rejects the Association's demands, they should completely stop the production of agricultural products. The Association specifically stipulates that agricultural products must have at least a price that covers the cost of production before they can be sold. Reno accused Agriculture Secretary Wallace of hindering the American Farmers' Holiday Association in various ways. Reno also said that whatever changes may occur in the future, the people in the Reconstruction Administration should be responsible, and Agriculture Secretary Wallace should be especially responsible. Wisconsin Governor Schmedeman has ordered the opening of all major roads to facilitate the transportation of agricultural products and has ordered the suppression of riots.

It is expected that agriculture will become more unstable after President Roosevelt rejects this proposal. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)</p>
<h3>Breakdown of War Debt Negotiations Between Britain and the United States; Wide Disagreement Between the Two Sides; Last-Ditch Effort Fails; Britain Plans to Pay a Portion of the Installment Due in December as a Token of Good Faith</h3>

<p>(Washington) The negotiations on the war debt problem between Britain and the United States have failed. Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, the British representative, plans to leave here for Britain on Wednesday. (Havas dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Today's efforts to revive the British-U.S. war debt negotiations have once again failed. After President Roosevelt met with representatives from both sides for an hour, it is said that it is unlikely that any further meetings will be held. When news of the breakdown of the negotiations was announced yesterday, it took all parties by surprise. Secretary of State Hull and Undersecretary of the Treasury Acheson then asked the President today to reconvene representatives from both sides to discuss ways to salvage the situation. British Ambassador Lindsay, accompanied by British representative Leith-Ross, went to the White House to meet with the U.S. President and met with White House advisors and Undersecretary of the Treasury Acheson. After discussing for about an hour, it was finally determined that the opinions of the two sides were too far apart and that it was impossible to continue the negotiations. All those who participated in the meeting today declined to comment on the matter. However, it was learned from other sources that they also discussed whether to issue a joint statement next week. Unlike previous war debt negotiations, this one was kept strictly confidential throughout. The reason was that neither side's representatives had made any concrete proposals at the beginning of the talks. The British representative's goal was only to find a solution that would not hinder the progress that Britain's industrial recovery was now beginning to make. The U.S. representative, on the other hand, wanted to find a plan that could be submitted to Congress and have a chance of passing. Unexpectedly, after both sides carefully studied the financial situations of the two countries, the result was that they could not reach a closer agreement on modifying the war debt. Therefore, the British side expressed that the entire war debt issue would be discussed again next year after weighing the situation. At present, a method of paying a portion of the installment due in December as a token of good faith will be proposed in the next day or two. This method is expected to be announced next week at the same time as an explanation of the breakdown of the negotiations. (National Telegram, 4th)</p>
<h3>Mount Aso in Japan Erupts; Molten Lava Boils and Turns Into a Sea of Fire; Explosions Resound Like Artillery Shells</h3>

<h3>Successful Rocket Test; Ascends to 32,000 Feet; Person in Rocket Lands Unharmed</h3>
<p>(London) The Sunday Referee reported today that a manned rocket has been successfully tested, a historic first. The German Army Department purchased a prototype of the rocket. A very secret test was recently held on the island of Rügen in the Baltic Sea. The designer, Mr. Feesel's brother, personally took the risk of performing the demonstration. The rocket is 24 feet long and is a thin tube shaped like a torpedo. The rocket was launched from a steel frame. After the rocket was fired into the sky, another rocket at its tail was automatically released on time, pushing it upward. The large rocket then went straight into the clouds, more than six miles from the ground. Then it fell, but with a parachute device, it was able to land safely. The person in the rocket was shaken and his face was pale, but he was not injured. It is said that he temporarily lost consciousness due to the extremely high speed during the first test, but he soon recovered and felt that the altitude had reached 32,000 feet.

<h3>Jiangbei Salt Reclamation Funds Will Be Borrowed from Cotton Funds; Half to Subsidize the Construction of the Reclamation Area; The Remainder to Be Used for Farmers' Production Equipment</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Jiangsu Provincial Government believes that the Jiangbei salt reclamation area has more than 13 million mu of uncultivated land. After repeated investigations and trials, it is indeed a suitable location for converting to cotton and wheat cultivation. However, the area is a special zone for salt reclamation, and there are not many residents, most of whom are salt-boiling households who are poor and cannot support themselves. Therefore, it is planned to attract farmers, and the production costs and construction of thatched houses must be funded by the government through loans. It has been requested that the Executive Yuan approve the allocation of 10 million yuan from the U.S. cotton and wheat funds, with 5 million yuan to subsidize the construction of ditches, roads, and bridges in the reclamation area, and the remaining 5 million yuan to subsidize farmers' production equipment and establish rural lending institutions. It is heard that the Executive Yuan attaches great importance to this plan, and it is expected that it will soon be approved by the Economic Council. (Special dispatch, 5th)</p>

<h3>Public Telegram</h3>
<p>Qidong Telegram Addressed to All Shanghai Newspaper Offices: Representatives recently submitted the following to Chairman Chiang, President Wang, and Minister of Finance Kong: (Titles Abbreviated) We are salt producers whose ancestral business is located in Chongming Waisha, Jiangsu, which after division became the jurisdiction of Qidong County. During the early years of the Republic of China, there were over one hundred salt kilns. The salt producers relied on Chongming Salt Bureau's commercial monopoly for their livelihood, with annual restrictions. Within a few years, only the 44 salt kilns within the range of our location's commercial monopoly remained. The 660 salt producer households, totaling 3,960 family members of all ages, lived peacefully. On September 2nd, a flood destroyed the salt kilns. The salt producers in our location borrowed money to rebuild. On September 18th, another flood struck, causing even greater losses. Relief was not received, so they continued to borrow money to rebuild. Although the losses of the salt producers were huge, our private losses were also significant. Unexpectedly, on October 23rd, the salt producers received a sudden notice from the eighth district chief of Qidong County, gathered at the district office, stating that the army had arrived and would destroy the kilns immediately. Now, together with the Songjiang Tax Police Bureau Chief, Ministry of Finance Commissioner, Qidong County Weighing Bureau Chief, and salt merchants, they persuaded the kilns to cease production, promising each kiln a fee of 240 yuan, forcing them to imprint their fingerprints as agreement. The next day, over 400 armed tax police came and destroyed each kiln. Alas, our 4,000 people, after suffering repeated floods, are now waiting for the Hua Yang Relief Association to raise funds for relief, like fish trapped in a dried cart rut waiting for the water of the West River. Yet, the local salt authorities treat these survivors of the disaster as if they are not dying fast enough, cutting off their livelihoods. We beg that you swiftly telegraph the Qidong County Magistrate and Weighing Bureau Chief to correct this unjust act, cancel the order to dismantle the kilns, in addition to the aforementioned fees as compensation for kiln destruction losses, and also to promptly raise funds to allow each kiln to resume production, saving the lives of 4,000 innocent salt producers. Yuan Yi and Shi Wenda, representatives of the salt producers in the disaster area of Qidong County, Jiangsu Province, together with 3,960 family members, humbly beg. Request that the above telegram be published in your newspaper to lend support. We are extremely grateful. Yuan Yi, Shi Wenda, Gu Zhangqing, Xu Jinshan, representatives of salt producers in the disaster area of Qidong County.</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang Strictens Military Discipline; Re-Orders the Elimination of Abuses; Cautions Officers and Soldiers to Treat the People as Their Own Wounds</h3>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: Chairman Chiang, in order to strictly prohibit bandit suppression troops from extorting supplies from local areas, causing disturbances, and stating that if there is an urgent need, local areas should assist in handling the matter through peaceful consultation and pay the appropriate price without insulting the people or resorting to violence, has successively promulgated eleven articles of limited measures for receiving troops in various bandit suppression areas, as well as reward and punishment regulations for civil and military officers and soldiers during bandit suppression, and an outline of measures for the bandit suppression army to relieve the people. He has separately instructed all troops to comply. It is now learned that Chairman Chiang has found that troops in the areas they arrive in are still forcibly demanding supplies, using them to extort, and even relying on force to double their efforts to compete for benefits. How can the disaster-stricken people endure such suffering? The impact of this is that the military and civilians cannot cooperate effectively from beginning to end, greatly hindering the progress of bandit suppression. Now, in order to eliminate abuses and rectify military discipline, in addition to the previously promulgated laws and regulations, which should be strictly observed, eight supplementary prohibitions were added yesterday, reiterating the admonition. The original order and supplementary points are recorded as follows: "The original purpose of raising troops to suppress bandits was to relieve the people and alleviate their suffering. All military salaries, conscripts, and temporary expenses of the advancing troops have been separately stipulated and distributed in full. They must not forcibly demand supplies or impose levies on local areas, causing disturbances. Moreover, the areas currently suppressing bandits have mostly suffered repeated catastrophes, with depleted finances and declining material resources. How can they provide supplies again? All officers and soldiers in the army should adhere to the principle of treating the people as if they were their own wounds and strictly avoid any violations, so that they can feel comforted by the arrival of assistance. Even if the army's movements are unfamiliar to the local people and there is an urgent need for local officials and gentry to assist in handling the matter, they should consider the local situation and supply capacity, consult peacefully, and pay the appropriate price. They must not wantonly insult or resort to violence, so as to avoid disturbing the local area and benefit the suppression efforts. This Committee Chairman, in view of this, has successively promulgated eleven articles of limited measures for receiving troops in various bandit suppression areas, as well as reward and punishment regulations for civil and military officers and soldiers during bandit suppression, and an outline of measures for the bandit suppression army to relieve the people, and separately instructed them to comply. The rules that soldiers should observe and the obligations that local areas should fulfill in handling military affairs have been clearly indicated and earnestly requested. However, it has recently been found that in the areas where various bandit suppression troops have arrived, they are forcibly ordering local areas to supply laborers and grain, or are requesting items that are not essential for the army. Moreover, the personnel assigned to handle these matters often have ulterior motives, demanding more than is actually needed and deliberately making things difficult and extorting. If they are not satisfied, they rely on force to roar, beat, and insult officials and gentry. As a result, those who are timid are at the mercy of their power and obey their orders. The people cannot avoid the suffering of being turned into intermediaries who extract compensation. The cunning ones take advantage of the situation to increase their expenses, and the troops commit their crimes. These people then take the opportunity to encroach on the people, and the people suffer even more exploitation. How can the disaster-stricken people endure such suffering? This is all due to the military's forced labor and the abuses that arise from it. No wonder local officials and gentry are afraid to avoid the arrival of troops. As a result, cooperation between the military and the government and between soldiers and civilians cannot be achieved from beginning to end, greatly affecting the progress of bandit suppression. This is extremely regrettable. This Committee Chairman has come to Jiangxi to command troops and save the people from fire and water. Anything that harms the local area cannot be tolerated. In order to eliminate the abuses of handling affairs and rectify military discipline for easy investigation, in addition to the limited measures for receiving troops in various bandit suppression areas and the outline of measures for the bandit suppression army to relieve the people, which have already been stipulated, they should be strictly observed and not exceeded in any way. Now, special supplementary measures are added and reiterated as follows: (1) It has been found that the various divisions currently engaged in suppression have sufficient transport troops, as there are already established transport battalions and companies, as well as transport troops accompanying each unit. In addition, the garrison divisions each have a fixed amount of food allowance. For reconnaissance and guidance, each division has an established reconnaissance team, and for communication, there is the establishment of a military postal service and communication stations. In addition, regardless of whether they are advancing or garrisoning, each division is issued bandit suppression expenses, such as miscellaneous expenses, which are used to purchase grass for soldiers to sleep on, tea, and all temporary employment and travel expenses. Moreover, troops and units at all levels have fixed office expenses. The needs and equipment of each troop have been fully distributed, and they must not demand anything from the local area in any way. If it is unavoidable and the local area must be asked to purchase or assist in handling the matter, such as military rice, firewood, grass for sleeping on, or any temporary necessities, such as hoes, baskets, carrying ropes, and stools, plank beds, etc., which must be temporarily borrowed from the local area, they should strictly comply with the various provisions of Article 4 of the limited measures for receiving troops in various areas and handle the matter according to the local situation. They must not arbitrarily demand extra or excessive amounts. (2) Each division currently has a military food procurement committee that specializes in procuring food items. If the various items listed above must be entrusted to the local area for assistance in purchasing or handling in the area where the troops arrive, the committee should contact the local area for handling in accordance with various regulations and methods, so as to assign special responsibility. Agencies above the division level or troops below the division level should still handle the matter in accordance with the provisions of Article 6 of the limited measures for receiving troops in various areas. (3) If the items, laborers, and tools that the local area is helping to handle cannot be arranged in time or if it is indeed difficult to arrange them completely in the area, each troop should be considerate of the situation and not make things difficult on purpose. (4) Military and local officials and gentry should be considerate of human feelings and get along peacefully when negotiating matters. If there are any incidents of relying on power to bully people or insulting local officials and gentry, once verified, regardless of the cause, they will all be sent to this headquarters for punishment according to law. If it is the behavior of subordinates, the responsible commander should also be held jointly responsible. (5) When troops arrive in the area, local officials and gentry must think of the hardships of the army and do their best to assist in all matters of reception within the possible scope of the local situation. They must not avoid difficulties. (6) If local officials and gentry encounter soldiers who illegally demand excessive amounts, unreasonably oppress, or violently abuse them, they should immediately report to this Committee Chairman for punishment according to law. They must not endure humiliation and carry the burden, turning around and forcing the people to do so. Otherwise, once discovered, they will be punished as if they were extortionists, in accordance with the reward and punishment regulations for civil and military officers and soldiers during bandit suppression. (7) The political training offices of each advancing and garrisoning division should report to the political training office of the division at any time on the items that they have entrusted to local officials and gentry to handle in the area they pass through or are stationed in, starting from the middle of this month. The political training office will then be responsible for verifying the information and reporting it to the headquarters of the various direct routes and to this headquarters in accordance with the first form listed below on a weekly basis for review. The commanders of each general command headquarters and each column command headquarters should report directly to this headquarters and the general command headquarters. From this month, the local governments of each county should fill out the reports truthfully in accordance with the second form listed below on a monthly basis and report them separately to this headquarters and the provincial government for review. (8) If the political training offices of each division and the county governments of each county fail to report on time in accordance with the aforementioned regulations, or if the reports are untrue, concealing or fabricating information, or if the commanders of each troop fail to report to the political training offices of their respective divisions at any time in accordance with the actual situation, this headquarters will severely punish them according to the circumstances once discovered. It must be known that those who win the people will prosper, and those who lose the people will perish. Since ancient times, when talking about war, the most important thing is harmony among the people. Bandit suppression is even more a war to win the people. If the people are not pleased, convinced, and close to the military, it will not only be difficult to achieve success in suppression, but it is also feared that every place will become thorny. Local officials and gentry are the leaders of the people and are familiar with the local situation. When troops arrive, they must rely on them as their confidants and trusted aides, and it is easy to gain their assistance. They must not be insulted or humiliated in vain, causing suspicion and obstruction. In short, the military, the government, soldiers, and civilians must be united as one, with the same heart and the same cause. Only then is it possible to achieve effectiveness in suppression. This is the key to success or failure. It is hoped that our military and political personnel will deeply reflect on this and strictly comply with the eight measures listed above. If there are still those who disregard laws and regulations, act recklessly, or are unwilling to implement them, this Committee Chairman will enforce his orders without exception. Once discovered, they will be severely punished according to law, without any leniency. They must all comply, and it is hoped that all subordinates will also comply. This is a most important order."

<h3>Bandit Suppression Military Operations in Southern Jiangxi Extremely Tense; Yu Hanmou Directs Operations in Daju; Third Army Headquarters Moved to Meixian</h3>
<p>Shantou Dispatch: After Gu Zhutong and Chiang Ting-wen assumed important positions in the northern bandit suppression army in Nanchang, a telegram was sent to Guangdong on October 24th, urging the southern bandit suppression army to advance at the same time. Yu Hanmou, the commander of the First Army, had returned to Guangzhou in response to Chen Jitang's telegram. When he was heading in Nanxiong, he received a telegram from Gu Zhutong, so he turned back to Daju Ridge to deploy the bandit suppression. Zhang Da, the commander of the Fourth Division, also went with him. Zhang immediately returned to Xinfeng for defense. Recently, the bandit gangs have gathered in the areas of Huichang, Junmenling, and the number is overwhelming. The elite troops of the bandit's pseudo 135th Army Corps are all in Ruijin, Huichang, and Yudu. At 7:00 a.m. on October 22nd, they launched a surprise attack on Chongbanshi, the border between Anyuan and Huichang, with the entire pseudo Independent Sixth Division, and engaged in a fierce battle with the Deng Qichang regiment of Yu Hanmou's Ye Zhao division. The bandits were entrenched in Jinshao Changhe. After two hours of fierce fighting, the Deng regiment finally repelled the bandits. Since then, they have often used bandit scouts to test the strength of the southern army, plotting to disturb them. Therefore, the Yu army is eager to join forces with the northern army to encircle and suppress the bandit gangs.</p>
<p>The Guangdong army has long blockaded the bandit area in southern Jiangxi. All oil, salt, grain, medicine, and daily necessities are not allowed to be transported into the bandit area. Huang Zhiwen, the commander of the Eighth Division of the Third Army's Li Yangjing unit, stationed in Xunwu, recently promulgated public sales measures for oil and salt in order to completely blockade the bandit area. The measures are as follows: (1) If the goods sold by the division's public sales association are to be purchased from outside, the county public association shall list the items and quantities and the date and location of purchase and apply to the military headquarters for a pass. (2) The public sales branches in each district shall list the items and apply to the county blockade association for a pass to purchase goods from the county public sales association. Due to special circumstances, Diping Township and Gongping branch are allowed to apply directly to the military headquarters for a pass when purchasing edible salt and kerosene. (3) For daily necessities that are not sold publicly, if they are to be purchased from outside the county or within the county, each business shall list the items and apply to the district regiment bureau or the joint保 office to which it belongs for a purchase pass. This pass shall be printed by the blockade association, numbered by the military headquarters, and issued to each district regiment bureau for the merchants to stamp and fill out for collection.

<h3>The Two Huai River Salt Commissioner Suggests Opening Up the Anqing Concession Area. Huai Salt Will Be Transported to Anqing by Steamer. Merchants of Datong's Twelve Wharfs All Oppose</h3>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: Miao Qiujie, the Salt Commissioner of the Two Huai Rivers, recently advocated transporting Huai salt in steamers with hundreds of tickets to open up the Anqing concession area. However, the business community of Datong believes that the prosperity of Datong relies on the import and export of salt. If Huai salt is directly transported to Anqing, the commerce of Datong will be fundamentally shaken, and they have expressed their opposition. The eighteen guilds of sail transport at Twelve Wharfs also petitioned to withdraw this measure, as the sudden change of Huai salt to steamer transport would greatly affect their livelihoods. Therefore, the Salt Affairs Bureau specially sent Miao himself, along with Ge Fulun (an Englishman) and Zeng Yangfeng, the section chief of the Audit General Office, from Hankou to Wuhu on the German "Dehe" steamer to discuss solutions. Miao and others stayed at the Salt Affairs Audit Office. Sun Faxu and seven other representatives of the Datong petitioners, and Xiao Yunqing and eight other representatives of the eighteen guilds of sail transport at Twelve Wharfs, visited Miao on the afternoon of the third. The Datong representatives stated that they strongly agreed with the Commissioner's promotion of salt sales, but regardless of southern or northern salt, they hoped to maintain the market within the scope of legal principles by not changing the shore. The Twelve Wharf representatives requested consideration for the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of sail transport workers and the withdrawal of the steamer transport order. Commissioner Miao said that opening up the Anqing concession area was originally intended to promote the sale of accumulated salt, resist the sale of refined salt, and try out steamer transport to increase tax revenue, with no intention of harming the Tong bank. Now that the petition seeks to maintain the Tong market, he will ensure that it is not contrary to law, regulations, or human sentiment. Moreover, the central government has designated the establishment of salt warehouses in Wuhu and Datong, while Anqing originally lacks such facilities. This trial sale of fifty tickets can be stored with only twenty tickets, which is sufficient. If the results are not good, it will be stopped in the future. As for the trial steamer transport, it is to control transportation and sales, and the sail transport business of Twelve Wharfs should also be taken into consideration. He also announced on the spot that he would go to Datong and Anqing to conduct on-site surveys as a basis for a solution. The representatives of both petitioning parties also requested permission to accompany the steamer for the survey, which was decided to depart together tomorrow morning (the fourth). According to the representatives, if the goal is not achieved, the petitioning action will not be stopped, and they will not hesitate to resort to administrative litigation in the end. (Third)</p>
<h3>Merchants and Citizens of Fuzhou Oppose the Foreign Rice Tax Tide. The Finance Department Changes the Method, Collecting Half Tax in October. The Tea Business Tax Will Be Suspended from the First of the Month. The Fujian Province Ship Tax Will Be Divided into Eight Districts for Collection</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Since the Fujian Finance Department started collecting the import tax on foreign rice, rice merchants in Fuzhou and Xiamen have strongly opposed it. Details have already been reported in the newspapers. It is found that the import of foreign rice is greater in Xiamen than in Fuzhou, so the opposition tide is also more intense in Xiamen than in Fuzhou. A committee of various sectors of Xiamen has been formed to request the postponement of the foreign rice tax, confronting the foreign rice tax bureau. In recent days, more than 30,000 bags of foreign rice shipped from Hong Kong and Yangon have been stockpiled in the warehouses of various shipping companies and cannot be sold. Therefore, the price of rice in Xiamen has risen from 5.5 yuan to 6.5 yuan per bag. The other day, the Finance Department, out of consideration for the merchants' difficulties, specially approved a flexible method: foreign rice imported in October will be allowed to pay half tax, only 50 cents per picul, while from November, the full tax of one yuan will be levied. As for the association requesting the postponement of the foreign rice tax, the Provincial Party Department considers it an illegal organization and has sent a letter to the Provincial Government to instruct the Siming Municipal Preparatory Office to disband it. However, whether the tide can be calmed is still difficult to say at present.</p>
<p>The cancellation of the tea business tax (i.e., export tax) has been suspended from registration and collection from November 1st, and the Finance Department has issued a notice. From now on, if there is any fraudulent collection or extortion, merchants are allowed to report the facts and the department will investigate and deal with it strictly. Taking this opportunity, tea merchants have been transporting black tea for export to the north and Southeast Asia, and it is expected that the spring tea market will improve.</p>
<p>The Fujian Province ship tax was also levied from the 1st, stipulating that steamships will be taxed at two yuan per ton per year, and sailing ships at one dime per dan per year. The province is divided into eight districts for tax collection: Fuzhou, Funing, Yanjian Shao, Xinghua, Zhangzhou, Quanzhou, Xiamen, and Tinglong. The Fuzhou district office is located in Fuzhou, the Funing district office is located in Dongchong, the Yanjian Shao district office is located in Yanping, the Zhangzhou district office is located in Shima, the Xinghua district office is located in Sanjiangkou, the Quanzhou district office is located in Xiutu, the Xiamen district office is located in Xiamen, and the Tingzhou district office is located in Fengshi. Inspection stations are set up at important ports in each district. All ships must pay taxes and obtain certificates before they can travel to various places. (November 4)</p>

This morning (the 4th) at 6:00, the train departed from Wande and arrived in Tai'an at 7:30, and immediately ascended Mount Tai to visit Feng Yuxiang. According to Feng, "I live in the mountains, read books, and write, and do not know about external affairs," so he has no opinions on the current situation. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>When Han's special train arrived at Tai'an Station, Feng's representatives Li Xin and Chen Xizeng were already waiting at the station to greet him. They immediately joined him to climb the mountain and visit Feng at the Five Sages Temple. Han walked in the front. At that time, the red sun was rising, and the color of Mount Tai was like a painting. Red leaves were interspersed among the green cypresses and pines, and the scenery was excellent. Passing the Baogong Temple, Han entered to visit and gave the abbot ten yuan, ordering him to take care of it carefully. Entering the Five Sages Temple, Feng welcomed him to the Xixin Pavilion outside the gate, first shaking hands and exchanging pleasantries with Han, and then shaking hands with others one by one. His attitude was humble and his complexion was ruddy. Because it was very cold in the mountains, Feng wore a small leather jacket with a blue coarse cloth surface, cotton trousers, and cloth shoes. His dress was as before. After arriving at the temple, Feng and Han talked in the west room, while the others sat in the open air under the pine trees in the courtyard, looking at the distant mountains like paintings, and felt refreshed.</p>
<p>At 8:30, Feng personally went to the kitchen in the backyard and brought out two large plates of noodles to entertain the guests. The dishes were tofu, cabbage, pickled salty vegetables, scrambled eggs, and fried spinach. Feng bowed to welcome the guests. Some sat, some stood, and they ate around the table, which had a special flavor. Feng ate and talked, saying that Tai'an had three beauties: cabbage, tofu, and water. Although there were few dishes today, all three beauties were present. After speaking, they laughed together. During the meal, Kang Yongjiu, a female propagandist from the Northeast brought by Han, spoke of the country's demise and the destruction of her home. Feng also couldn't help but sigh.</p>
<p>After the meal, Feng and Han went to the west room again and chatted for a long time. Then they went out together to visit the Five Sages Temple, and then went to the Martyrs' Shrine built by Feng about half a mile east. The shrine has three buildings in total. In the central building, the spirit tablets of the martyrs who died in the Xinhai Luanzhou Uprising are enshrined. In the east building are Zhang Shaozeng and his wife Guo Songling, and in the west building is Zheng Jinsheng. All the spirit tablets are made of stone, in order to last for a long time. The shrine is backed by high mountains and faces a deep valley. Towering trees are densely distributed around it. Feng said that the martyrs shed blood and died for the revolution, and only won a few shrines for people to mourn, which is also regrettable.</p>
<p>Outside the shrine, the reporter asked Feng what his opinions were on the current situation. Feng said he had no opinions. He lives in the mountains, reads books, and writes, and does not know about external affairs. He only read about the Lin Ken and Shui Ken superintendents in the newspapers. He has not heard anyone talk about this, and Chairman Han has not mentioned it either. At 10 o'clock, Han and his party bid farewell and went down the mountain. Feng shook hands with them one by one to see them off, but left Zheng Jicheng to stay on the mountain temporarily. (4th)</p>

The refugees were all carrying the old and the young, and most of them were carrying their broken furniture in single-wheeled carts, gathering together. According to the refugees, the territory of Jinxiang, Jining, and Yutai counties is still full of water, and wheat has not yet been sown. The weather is getting colder and colder, and the suffering is really unbearable (1st)</p>
<h3>Zhang Xiangwu Talks About the Situation of the Changshan Eight Islands: From the Takeover Process to the Governance Policy. The Islanders Live and Work in Peace and Contentment.</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Changshan Eight Islands belong to Penglai County, Shandong, and were formerly a naval base in Northeast China. The other day, Provincial Government Chairman Han Fuqu toured Jiaodong and considered the islands to be the gateway to the navy, which is very important to Shandong's coastal defense. He specially appointed Zhang Xiangwu, commander of the Shandong Fifth Route Militia, to concurrently serve as the administrative chief of the Eight Islands. In mid-October, the reporter went to the island for an on-the-spot inspection. Buying a boat north from Penglai County, we arrived at Changshan Island in one hour, which is the location of the Changshan Eight Islands Special Zone Administrative Commissioner's Office, and is also the largest island in the group. There are quite a few new buildings in it, and roads have been opened on the shore. Looking into the distance, Miao Island and Tuoji Island are arranged in the sea, with sailboats and sandy islands, and the water and sky are connected, and the scenery is excellent. The people along the way live and work in peace and contentment, with mulberry, hemp, chickens, and dogs, and there is a concept of a paradise. After landing, the reporter went to the commissioner's office to visit Zhang Xiangwu, the administrative commissioner. Zhang detailed the takeover, organization, and future governance policy, as recorded below.</p>
<h3>Organize the Commissioner's Office</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhang said, "I was ordered to concurrently manage the administration of the Eight Islands. I am ashamed to be a political expert, and I am deeply afraid of failing the expectations of the people. At this time, foreign troubles are becoming increasingly urgent, and the times are difficult. I only have conscience and blood to start anew with the people. When the Eight Islands were previously under the jurisdiction of the Navy, all facilities adopted a laissez-faire policy, and all reforms were presided over by the presidents of the various communities. The reason for this is that most of the staff of the Commissioner's Office were transferred from the Navy Headquarters to concurrently hold positions. It was difficult to consider both, so the administrative facilities of the Eight Islands had to be entrusted to the presidents of the various communities. I am deeply dissatisfied with this laissez-faire policy. I think that governing and leading troops are the same thing. If you are not careful at the beginning, it is difficult to succeed in the end. If you do not turn the tide at this time, what can you do to realize the spirit of the law and political integrity to comfort the people? Therefore, I resolutely organized a sound commissioner's office in the first step, recovered the right to govern, and looked forward to the day when administrative unity would be achieved. As for the organization of the commissioner's office, because I concurrently serve as the commander of the Fifth Route, I cannot be stationed on the island all the time, so I specially set up a director, a general affairs section, an education section, and a directly under public security bureau. Due to limited funds, it is not convenient to expand the scope."</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of Education</h3>
<p>The Eight Islands are isolated in the sea, and the culture is backward. If you want to open up the people's wisdom, you must implement appropriate education. The development of education depends entirely on the transfer of funds. In the past, the education funds of the Eight Islands were about more than 30,000 yuan per year, which was temporarily apportioned by the thirteen communities of the Eight Islands, and the education association was the institution that managed the funds. Since there are no statutory funds and no appropriate guarantees, it is difficult to apportion the funds. The education association has no remedial measures. According to statistics, there are six two-level primary schools, twenty-two primary schools, five girls' schools, and one sericulture girls' school in the educational institutions of the Eight Islands. More than 3,000 students often drop out of school because of the lack of school funds, which is very painful. I have a major responsibility for the education of the Eight Islands and the future of the country, so I changed the education association to the education section of the commissioner's office, in order to supervise and supervise at any time, and to make meritorious achievements from the date of establishment. I am now actively planning to allocate the local group income of the Eight Islands to the education fund, and strive to make the education fund independent, in order to complete the important mission of developing the education of the Eight Islands.</p>
<h3>Maintain Security</h3>
<p>The Eight Islands are the gateway to the Bohai Sea and are of vital importance to coastal defense. In addition to the Public Security Bureau being responsible for maintaining security, the Fifth Route Militia Army and pistol team were also transferred and distributed to each island to assist in maintaining it. Judging from the current observations, the security of the Eight Islands is indeed guaranteed.</p>
<h3>Transportation and Communication</h3>
<p>Because the Eight Islands are scattered in the sea and are not connected to each other, transportation is very inconvenient. It is especially difficult for coastal defense, security, and fishery protection. It is now planned that the commissioner's office will purchase a steamship, which will be convenient for the commissioner's office to work, and for the people to come and go, so that the Eight Islands will be united as one, so that no gap will occur between the islands and communities, and they will help each other and communicate with each other.</p>
<h3>Construction Plan</h3>
<p>The financial resources of the Eight Islands are limited and construction is very difficult. It is now planned that the government and the people will cooperate and carry out the necessary construction within the possible scope. The following three items are now considered necessary to actively carry out: (1) Build ring roads and cross-shaped roads on each island; (2) Dig wells; (3) Plant trees.</p>
<h3>Abundant Marine Products</h3>
<p>The land of the Eight Islands is not suitable for cultivation. In terms of agricultural products, there is no value in recording. Eight or nine out of ten people in the island are engaged in fishing. The abundance of marine products is quite famous, especially sea cucumber, shark fin, abalone, scallops, mussels, and laver, which are the main products. It is a pity that the manufacturing and preservation methods have not been obtained, which is a great sigh. It is now planned to guide merchants to jointly establish a marine product canning company, in order to preserve the original quality and sell it to various places, which can also slightly block leaks.</p>
<h3>Scope of Administration</h3>
<p>The eight islands under the jurisdiction of this office include Nanchangshan Island, Beichangshan Island, Miao Island, Xiaoheishan Island, Tuoji Island, Da Xiaoqin Island, and Nan Bei Chenghuang Island. The above eight islands are still divided into thirteen communities as before. Nanchangshan Island has Xishan Community, Dongshan Community, Liancheng Community, Nancheng Community, Beichangshan Island has Beicheng Community, Beidianzi Community, Miao Island has Miao Island Community, Daheishan Island has Nanzhuang Community, Beizhuang Community, Xiaoheishan Island has Xiaoheishan Community, Tuoji Island has Tuoji Community, Daxiaoqin Island has Qin Island Community, and Nanbei Huangcheng Island has Huangcheng Community. Each of the above thirteen communities originally had one president and one vice president. It is now planned to change to a district system, change the community to a district, and set up a district chief for each district, in order to comply with administrative laws and regulations and achieve the effect of unity.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Entire Island</h3>
<p>After meeting Zhang Xiangwu, the reporter was led by Gao Zhuoyun, director of the commissioner's office, and Lin Wensen, chief of the general affairs section, to visit various schools, agricultural and forestry experiment farms, fruit tree gardens, the general chamber of commerce, the naval office, the naval officers' club, the engineering club, the naval ammunition depot, the radio station, the naval parade ground, and the sea transport wharf. We also visited the Haiou and Haihe gunboats. A poor and remote area for thousands of years has suddenly become a place with access to all directions. If we continue to work hard on construction, we will be able to keep pace with Weihai and Yantai. (November 1)</p>
<h3>Shang Dynasty Divination Turtle Shell Discovered in Anshang. Han Dynasty Stone Paintings Found in the Tomb of Prince Cao</h3>
<p>Teng County Correspondence: The Academia Sinica and the Shandong Stone Relics Research Association have jointly excavated stone relics in Anshang Village, Teng County, and the Tomb of Prince Cao. The construction of the Tomb of Prince Cao has now progressed to the fifth pit, and other destroyed tomb pits will be excavated, and tunnels will be dug to find underground ruins. The work is gradually becoming busy. Dong Zuobin specially transferred Wang Xiang to assist yesterday. Wang arrived at the Tomb of Prince Cao on the 2nd and was responsible for monitoring the pit digging work. Dong Zuobin, Qi Yanpei, and Li Fanglan are responsible for Anshang Village. The work has now progressed from the seventeenth pit to the twenty-second pit. The work in both places is gradually entering a tense period, and the objects discovered continue to be extremely valuable. The details are recorded as follows.</p>
<h3>Discovery of the Cao Wang Tomb</h3>
<p>Dong Zuobin arrived at the Cao Wang Tomb from Anshang around 10 AM on October 31st and planned with Mou Xiangnong to open other tombs. They agreed to open two more pits, one in the east and one in the south, both in lower terrains, below the three existing pits. Assuming the one in the east would be the fourth pit and the one in the south the fifth. The unfinished work on the third pit would also be completed that evening. From the first of this month to today (the 3rd) afternoon, the earth and mud in the fourth and fifth pits had also been mostly removed. Tomorrow (the 4th), they will excavate other tombs and plan to dig pits to search for any tomb ruins underground for a thorough investigation. As for the excavation of the fourth and fifth pits and the items found: (1) The fourth pit, 1.73 meters deep, had also been destroyed and excavated before. It was not until the afternoon of the 2nd that the mud, earth, and stones were cleared. The top doors of other tombs were built with stacked stones, but this one had a stone slab as a cover, a slight difference in construction. The tomb door also faced south, and the front of the interior was also a stone chamber. Each of the east and west stone walls had a star-shaped pattern carved on them, resembling the white sun on the current party flag, but with fewer rays, only four. The rear part was a stone cave, deep and extending about one meter, with the base of the cave being one foot higher than the tomb floor. All of these were different from other tombs. There were also two stone pillars, seemingly dividing the stone cave into two sections. It is thought that this pit was also for a joint burial, with the pillars erected to support the pressure from above and to separate the two coffins. However, the bones inside were already scattered, making it impossible to know the original state. In front of the cave was a square stone attached to the west wall, likely a stone table. (2) The fifth tomb was two meters deep, and its structure was roughly the same as the fourth tomb, but the stone cover on top had been moved away by the people of "Muzhuang" and used as a bridge. As for the items found, on the morning of the 2nd, twenty-seven pieces of broken bones were excavated from the southeast corner of the fourth tomb. At the same time and place, eleven Wuzhu coins were found, two of which were slightly smaller in size, resembling the edge-less Wuzhu coins of the Liang Dynasty. Also, a "Ban Liang" coin used during the reign of Emperor Wen of the Han Dynasty was found, with intact edges and clear inscriptions. From this, it can be inferred that these are undoubtedly Han tombs. The fifth tomb had already been excavated by others, and apart from broken pottery shards and scattered bones, nothing else was found. There was also a broken piece of pottery jar. A stone box was opened to the east of the fifth tomb, but nothing was found inside. According to Dong Zuobin, based on personal observation, the Cao Wang Tomb may be a burial ground for a cluster of tombs. Once all the work is completed, the relics and remains will be fully revealed, uncovering secrets that have lasted for thousands of years, and the depth of interest is beyond description. According to Mou Xiangzhen, in recent days, two painted stones have also been found. One was found during the excavation of a pit, a piece of tile-ridged roof ridge, presumably from the first tomb. It is thought that there were originally four ridges of a dining hall (i.e., sacrificial hall), but only one is now found. The rest may have been destroyed by the local people. The other was found in a temple at the foot of the mountain, a painted stone statue of Confucius meeting Laozi. I have previously seen the "Wu Liang Shrine" in Jiaxiang County and the "Xiaotangshan" in Feicheng, with Han Dynasty stone carvings. The style is roughly the same as this one (the painted stone statue of Confucius meeting Laozi). They were often found in ancient ancestral halls, as it was a popular custom at the time. The one in the Wu Liang Shrine is more complete, with clerical script engraved on it. Above the person standing with his hands clasped is a rectangular block with the three characters "Laozi Ye" (Laozi also) engraved on it. Behind is a carriage with the three characters "Laozi Che" (Laozi's carriage) engraved on it. Confucius is shown in a stooped and bowing posture, with the three characters "Kongzi Ye" (Confucius also) engraved above him. The carriage parked behind also has the three characters "Kongzi Che" (Confucius' carriage) engraved on it, for a total of twelve characters. The carved patterns on the clothing are all flat. However, the one obtained this time only has one corner remaining, also with clerical script like the (Confucius meeting Laozi statue) characters. The clothes are all engraved with patterns, with the ones on top being more elaborate, which is also a point of difference. When Curator Wang (Xiantang) comes, I may go to Feicheng to visit the Xiaotangshan stone carvings. If this can be realized, a comparative study with this place will yield very satisfactory results. My previous research was only based on the investigation of a single place and a single object, so the gains were very small. Now that I have this entire Han tomb to study, it is truly a lifelong blessing and a blessing for archaeological history, etc.</p>
<h3>Discoveries at Anshang Village</h3>
<p>The work at Anshang Village has progressed from the 17th pit to the 21st pit. Today (the 3rd) afternoon, excavation of the 22nd pit has also begun. The first pit, initially opened at the south end, has already been filled with earth. At the east end of the third pit, about one meter north, a wellhead was discovered, circular in shape, with a diameter of about one meter and a depth of over seven meters. The surrounding area is all soil, with no bricks or tiles from the wellhead to the bottom of the well. The lowest layer is white-yellow sand, which glitters with golden light when taken out. According to Dong Zuobin, this is the powder of mica stone. The 17th pit is where Zhou Dynasty bronze artifacts were unearthed this spring. Wang Xiantang suspected that it was a storage place for carved scriptures. The excavation proves that the place was a tomb, and the bronze artifacts were burial objects. Now the traces of the tomb are clearly visible, and the doubts are dispelled. It is covered with a mat, and two large doors are placed on top to prevent people from trampling on it, awaiting Wang's inspection. There are many circular holes of varying sizes and depths inside the other pits, some filled with ash and charcoal, similar to stove vents, and some resembling places where vats have been buried, but the vats are nowhere to be found, only residual bottom prints are clearly visible. This is a matter of speculation. There are also the remains of standing pillars, but the wood of the pillars has rotted into sawdust, and only the sockets remain, etc. This morning (the 3rd), two slightly complete pottery pieces were found again in the 21st pit. Dong called them fragments of Douzun, while the elders here referred to them as "yin-yang jars," that is, after a person dies, their family cooks a bowl of rice, which is offered in front of the deceased's head before burial. At the time of burial, it is poured into the jar (yin-yang jar) and buried with the coffin. However, the shape of today's jar seems to be slightly larger, etc. As for the recent work situation, according to Dong Zuobin, recent excavations and acquisitions still consist mostly of pottery fragments and bones, and many remains of wells, stoves, pillar bases, etc. have been found. However, there is one thing that is extremely worthy of our attention and great interest, and it is beyond our initial expectations for excavating this place. This thing is a turtle plastron, the ventral shell of a turtle, initially mixed among the pottery shards collected. Because we are excavating on one side and washing on the other, and we have hired two people to write and number, I was able to see it yesterday while supervising the washing. After washing, the true appearance was revealed. Observing its inner surface, there are traces of drilling and burning, and on the outer surface, there are traces of divination, indicating that it is a tortoise shell used for divination in the Shang Dynasty. During the Shang Dynasty, there were two techniques for divination: turtle divination and bone divination. Bone divination used the scapula of cattle. Many ox scapula used for bone divination were obtained during the excavation at Chengziya. This time, a piece of turtle plastron for turtle divination was obtained, both of which are rare treasures. The techniques of turtle divination and bone divination were prevalent in the Shang Dynasty and were the origin of later divination techniques. By the Zhou Dynasty, they had gradually fallen into disuse. During the Shang Dynasty in our country, the territory was very small. At that time, the people of Qi and Lu were still regarded as barbarians, and culture had not yet spread to the east (i.e., present-day Shandong). Later, the method of bone divination gradually became popular, and the Qi region mostly imitated it. The method of turtle divination was passed on to the Zhu region. The discovery of a turtle plastron here proves that before the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, Western culture (the Shang capital, Hao, was called Western) had already reached this place. This means that during the Yin and Zhou dynasties, someone had introduced the method of turtle divination to this place, which later became a ruin. We have already stated the purpose of our initial excavation of this place, and we expected to find relics and remains from (Xiao Zhu), but nothing has been seen. What is presented to us today, such as the remains of wells and stoves, seems to be shrouded in doubts, but after all the work is completed, it can be solved one by one, etc. (3rd)</p>

<h3>Songjiang Fire Brigade Stages a Play to Raise Funds</h3>
<p>The fire prevention affairs in Songjiang are voluntarily undertaken by merchants who donate funds to form an organization. Although they strive to improve all equipment, they are limited by funding and cannot achieve full development. Now, the First District Fire Brigade has decided to borrow the Songjiang Grand Theater from the 6th onwards, hiring actors from Shanghai Jiu Ji and Datong theaters, as well as actors from the Linfeng Stage and the Dachu Stage, to perform for ten days, using ticket income to fund the First District Fire Brigade.</p>
<h3>Suspect in the Zhujiahang Robbery Case Handed Over to the Court for Interrogation</h3>
<p>After the robbery of Wu Youlan's home in Zhujiahang Township, Punan, the victim reported the case to the authorities for investigation. The Minhang Water Police Department discovered that the case involved Jiang Biyu, a Jiangbei person who sold rice husks, as a major suspect. On August 20th, the department dispatched police to arrest the suspect and his six family members near Longhua and escorted them to the Minhang Department. After a brief interrogation, they submitted a document to the Songjiang County Court Procuratorate for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Citywide Strike by Clothing Stores</h3>
<p>The county government of this city, in order to rectify the city's appearance, had previously instructed the Public Security Bureau to order the prohibition of shops occupying sidewalks and fixed stalls. The Fifth Branch of the Public Security Bureau outside the North Gate then ordered the police to enforce the prohibition of stalls along the streets. The vendors, feeling that their livelihoods were cut off and unable to make a living, took documents to the county government to petition for the revocation of the order, but without result. Unexpectedly, this problem has not yet been resolved, and yesterday (the 5th), all the clothing stores in the city continued their strike. The reason was that a clothing stall board in front of the Xicheng Clothing Store on Hanchang Road outside the Guangfu Gate had not been brought into the store. At about 11:00 AM that morning, the police officer on duty from the First Branch of the Public Security Bureau came to the store and ordered it to be brought in. The shop assistant Zhang Erguan argued with the police and was taken to the bureau. The store, feeling that the police were putting pressure on them and making it difficult to do business, immediately closed the store. In an instant, nine clothing stores on the street, including Xie Mao Run, Tai Feng, De Cheng, Yuan Feng Tai, Tai Yuan Feng, Yu Cheng, Jin Hua, Yuan Da, and Yi Tai, also closed their stores in succession. By 2:00 PM, all the clothing stores outside the North Gate had also closed in response, and the disturbance spread. Fan Xin, the head of the Second Branch, immediately reported the matter to the county government by telephone for investigation. After receiving the call, County Magistrate Yan, in addition to instructing Branch Chief Fan to pay attention to security, also instructed the Public Security Bureau and the Police Brigade to take precautions to avoid disputes. That evening, the clothing stores on the street sent a letter to Cheng Jingtang, the head of the Tonghan Township Office, asking him to forward a letter to the Second Branch, requesting the release of shop assistant Zhang Erguan and the dismissal and investigation of the police officer on duty. All water tanks, etc., should be temporarily exempted from the prohibition and implemented after the spring to maintain commerce. As of the time of the reporter's dispatch, the matter had not yet been resolved.</p>
<h3>Changzhou Commissioner Cai Inspects Various Counties</h3>
<p>Cai Ziping, the administrative inspector of the Second District, set off on the 5th to inspect the administration of the five counties under his jurisdiction. Commissioner Cai plans to first go to Liyang and then to counties such as Xiyi. The duties of the commissioner's office and the concurrent position of county magistrate will be handled by the secretaries of the two offices on his behalf.</p>
<h3>Two Convicts in the Ship Robbery Case Executed by Firing Squad</h3>
<p>The Wuyi County Office had previously received two bandits, Su Liu Mazi and Chen Xiao Erzi, who confessed to robbing ships during repeated interrogations. They were sentenced to death and reported to the provincial government for approval. County Magistrate Cai dispatched police at 10:00 AM on the 4th to bring the two convicts to the case, verify their identities, and bind them to the Fengweidun execution ground for execution by firing squad.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou Bandits Arrested in Yilu Robbery Case</h3>
<p>The home of Tong Shibin in X溝tou, Yilu, which belongs to the county, was robbed by bandits some days ago. The county government sternly ordered the Sixth Platoon of the Yiling Police stationed there to solve the case within a time limit. The platoon has now arrested three bandits, Wang Gaoqi, Han Yougui, and Hang Maocai. According to their confessions, they admitted to robbing the Tong family. They have now been escorted to the city and sent to the county for disposition.</p>
<h3>Police Squad Soldier Commits Suicide by Gunshot</h3>
<p>Cui Zhufeng, a Shandong recruit, was 30 years old and served as a policeman in the Fourth Squad of the Second Company of the County Police Squad, stationed in Sanguang Temple, Huoqiao. He was disciplined and trusted by his superiors. Unexpectedly, at about 7:00 PM on the 3rd, he suddenly committed suicide by gunshot, hitting a vital point and dying instantly. Squad Leader Shao Zhixiang immediately reported the matter to the brigade headquarters for investigation. It is reported that Cui had applied for leave of absence due to illness a few days ago but was not approved. He then became depressed and expressed to his colleagues that he had no interest in life. Now that he has suddenly committed suicide, it is suspected that there is a hidden story.</p>
<h3>Qingpu Farmers Kidnapped from the Xie Residence</h3>
<p>Pan Fuqing, a farmer in Xiezhaizxiang in the Second District of this county, was well-to-do and coveted by bandits. Fearing robbery, he had moved to Zhujiajiao, the main town of this county. Recently, due to the autumn harvest, he moved back again. Unexpectedly, late at night the other day, a pirate ship suddenly came with nine bandits, each armed with guns, who broke into the house, ransacked boxes and cabinets, and robbed cash and jewelry, worth more than a thousand yuan. Before leaving, they kidnapped Pan Fuqing.</p>
<h3>Nantong Mutineers of the Lusi Garrison Separately Sentenced</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Maritime Guerrilla Team, which mutinied in Lüsi, was apprehended by the garrison troops in the Kenmu District, including Jiang Tongshan and 14 other mutineers and squad leader Yue Haining. They were escorted to the Nantong County Office. The provincial security department sent personnel to Nantong for interrogation. The interrogation has now concluded and been submitted to the provincial government for sentencing. The mutineers, including Jiang Tongshan, were sentenced to 12 years of imprisonment for picking up property along the way during the mutiny. However, due to their pitiable circumstances, the original sentence was reduced by one-half, effectively sentencing them to six years of imprisonment. Signalman Ding Shuhe was sentenced to six months of imprisonment for leaving his post without reason during the mutiny. Yue Haining and orderly Liu Guangming were not comparable to deserters and were found not guilty.</p>

<h3>Zhang and Li Visited Sun Ke Yesterday, Who Said He Heard that Hu's Attitude Had Softened Compared to Before. Yang Dezhao Visited Sun Yesterday and Will Return to Guangdong in a Few Days.</h3>
<p>Guowen News Agency reported that Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, visited Li Shizeng and Song Ziwen in Shanghai the day before. Yesterday morning at 10:30, the reporter visited, and Zhang Jingjiang and Li Shizeng had just left Sun's residence. The reporter sent in his card to request an audience. Before long, Yang Dezhao, the representative of Chen Jitang of Guangdong Province, also arrived. He took his leave at 11:45. Sun is now scheduled to go to Nanjing in a day or two. The record of the conversation with Sun is as follows:</p>
<h3>Mr. Sun's Chat</h3>
<p>A reporter interviewed Mr. Sun and first inquired about the results of his conversations with Mr. Zhang and Mr. Li during their visit, as well as the recent situation of Mr. Hu Zhantang in Hong Kong. He replied that Mr. Zhang and Mr. Li had come to see him this morning. He had visited them after arriving in Shanghai yesterday, and their meeting was just a brief discussion of the overall situation in China and various departmental issues, nothing of great importance. As for Mr. Hu's situation in Guangdong, he was not sure of the exact details. According to rumors, Mr. Hu's attitude was indeed somewhat more moderate than before, but since Mr. Hu himself had not expressed any opinions recently, it was difficult to determine the truth. In any case, the national crisis is so serious that we must unite, prioritize resisting foreign aggression and then stabilizing the country. But even for stabilizing the country, unity is essential. At this moment, Mr. Yang Dezhao has arrived, as he plans to travel to Guangdong Province in the coming days, so I specifically invited him to talk, etc.</p>
<h3>Yang Dezhao's Talk</h3>
<p>The reporter met Mr. Yang at Mr. Sun's residence and engaged in casual conversation. Mr. Yang stated, "I came to Shanghai from Beijing the day before yesterday (three days ago). The bandit suppression troops in Guangdong Province have advanced north of Xunwu. Guangdong Province has been making extraordinary efforts in bandit suppression recently, and the newly编 New Fourth Division has been completely formed and is being transported to the front lines. I have discussed the financial situation in Guangdong Province before. In the past, it relied entirely on overseas Chinese merchants, but now that the trade of overseas Chinese merchants has declined to this extent, the financial situation is naturally difficult, and there is a danger of not being able to sustain it. I plan to return to Guangdong in the shortest possible time, but the date has not yet been determined."</p>
<h3>Italian Envoy Arrives in Shanghai This Afternoon</h3>
<p>The newly appointed Italian Ambassador to China, Mr. Poskari, left Italy in mid-last month aboard the Italian mail ship Conte Verde to assume his post. He passed through Hong Kong the day before yesterday and is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at 1:30 PM today, docking at the Qichang Pier in Pudong. At that time, Mr. Yu Ming, the director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai Office, and the Italian Consul General in Shanghai, among others, will go to the pier to welcome him.</p>
<h3>British Envoy Postpones Departure from China</h3>
<p>The Universal News reports that British Ambassador Lampson has changed his plans and will postpone his departure from China by two weeks. Mr. Lampson was originally scheduled to depart on the Chitral on the 28th of this month, but he will now take the Blue Funnel Line ship on December 12th. As a result, the farewell banquets for Mr. Lampson in this city will also be postponed by two weeks.</p>
<h3>Navy Jiangfeng Aircraft Blocked by Rain Yesterday in Nantong - Telegram Reports Returning to Shanghai in the Afternoon but Did Not Arrive by Evening - Expected to Return to Shanghai After the Weather Clears</h3>
<p>Zeng Yijing, the director of the Naval Aircraft Manufacturing Department, sent Xu Chengqi in a Jiangfeng aircraft at noon the day before yesterday, carrying Jiang Tianxun, a representative of the Nantong academic community, to fly to Nantong and land at Tianshenggang, so that the locals could enthusiastically promote aviation to save the people and observe. He also contacted them to order self-made aircraft. It was originally scheduled to return to Shanghai yesterday afternoon with the engineer Ma Deshu, who had been sent to Nantong in advance. Yesterday morning, it rained, making flying difficult, and it was expected that the return would be postponed. At 11:40 AM, the Aircraft Department received a telegram from Jiang Tianxun, a representative of the Nantong academic community, to a friend in Shanghai, Mr. Yin, who forwarded it to Director Zeng: "The Jiangfeng aircraft is scheduled to return to Shanghai at 3:00 PM this afternoon, Tianxun." After receiving the telegram, Director Zeng Yijing went to the Gaochangmiao Aircraft Department at 3:30 PM to wait, but the Jiangfeng had not returned to Shanghai by 4:30 PM. He immediately inquired about the weather by telephone and learned that Nantong had heavy rain at 2:30 PM in the afternoon, and Shanghai had heavy rain at 3:00 PM in the afternoon. It was impossible to fly above 300 feet. After 5:00 PM, it was difficult to fly below 300 feet because it was dark and the path was difficult to distinguish. He waited until after 6:00 PM, but the Jiangfeng had still not arrived and no telegram had been received. It was expected that it was blocked by the rain and would have to wait for the weather to clear before returning to Shanghai.</p>
<p>At 6:00 PM yesterday afternoon, the Naval Aircraft Manufacturing Department received a telegram from the pilots Xu Chengqi, etc., which was forwarded by the Shanghai Jiangnan Shipyard to Director Zeng: "We attempted to fly to Shanghai at 3:10 PM this afternoon, braving the rain, but due to white fog in the sky and wind and rain, we returned to Nantong midway. We will change to returning to Shanghai tomorrow morning, Chengqi, Deshu."</p>
<h3>Cotton Industry Control Committee Pays Attention to Cotton Planting and Weaving - National Cotton Fields Increase Annually - The Decline of Yarn Factories Urgently Needs Relief</h3>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that the Cotton Industry Control Committee of the National Economic Council, since its establishment, is about to complete a month. It has already begun to work separately on the improvement of cotton seeds and the relief of the disastrous drop in cotton prices. For the improvement of cotton seeds, attention is being paid to the current situation of cotton planting in various places. The committee has sent cotton experts Sun Enshuang and others to various places to conduct inspections as a reference for improving cotton seeds. The following is a report on the various situations learned by the Central News Agency reporter:</p>
<h3>Cotton Fields in Various Provinces Have Increased Sharply Year by Year</h3>
<p>The cotton-producing areas in the country are the most abundant in Jiangsu, Hubei, and Hebei, followed by Shandong, Henan, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hunan, and Jiangxi. Surveys have been conducted every year. The most recent second survey of this year shows a total of 39,684,369 mu of cotton fields, with a cotton production of 9,838,286 dan. The first survey of this year showed 39,157,446 mu, with a production of 10,734,451 dan. It is also known that the survey in the 20th year of the Republic of China totaled 31,637,779 mu, with 6,399,780 dan, and the survey last year totaled 37,099,800 mu, with 8,105,637 dan. The area and production of cotton fields have increased year by year.</p>
<h3>Cotton Farmers Must Improve Planting</h3>
<p>The amount of cotton field production is, of course, related to the improvement of planting, but the weather and Fengshui also have a significant impact. The average yield per mu in the first production this year was just over 27 catties of lint. If the rainfall is timely, it can increase to more than 30 catties. The current situation of cotton production in various provinces shows that Shanxi Province has made the fastest progress. The area of cotton fields in the country is very large. If planting and other aspects are improved, the production can be increased, and there will be no need to rely on foreign goods. Cotton experts, who were ordered to conduct inspections in various places this time, believe that cotton planting in various places still adheres to old methods, and the low cotton plants and small cotton bolls are the only reasons why the production cannot be fully increased.</p>
<h3>Investigating is the First Step to Helping Cotton Prices</h3>
<p>The Cotton Industry Control Committee is deeply concerned that there may be omissions in the previous surveys of national cotton fields, etc., so it has decided to conduct a detailed survey in the near future. In addition to the two items of cotton fields and production, the amount of abandoned and barren land, the names of cotton merchants in various places, and the lives of cotton farmers will also be investigated in detail. As for the relief measures for the recent disastrous drop in cotton prices in the market, it is difficult to see results without a complete plan. Buying a large amount of cotton to increase cotton prices is not a fundamental solution.</p>
<p>In recent years, our country has been affected by the world economic panic externally and the decline of the rural economy internally, resulting in the decline of all industries, and the textile industry is on the verge of bankruptcy. However, the yarn weaving industry of Japanese merchants in Shanghai is still able to maintain its business due to the economic assistance of the Japanese government. As a result, our country's yarn factories feel increasingly unable to support themselves. The following is a record of the recent situation of our country's yarn weaving industry and the situation of Japanese merchants in China:</p>
<h3>Recent Situations of Chinese and Japanese Manufacturers</h3>
<p>Our country's textile industry began to flourish after purchasing machinery for manufacturing in the late Qing Dynasty, and especially during the European War. It initially had only hundreds of thousands of spindles, and later increased to more than one million spindles. At that time, various countries were shifting their production capacity to the manufacture of armaments, resulting in a cut off in the source of supply, which led to a supply exceeding demand, and the textile industry gradually developed. The yarn weaving factories of Japanese merchants in Shanghai also kept pace with us. Therefore, today, there are more than 1.25 million yarn spindles in Shanghai owned by Japanese merchants, while our country has only a little over 1.06 million. Among the yarn factories in Shanghai, 28 are self-operated by Chinese people, and 30 are owned by Japanese merchants. Therefore, the textile industry in this city is almost controlled by Japanese merchants.</p>
<h3>Reasons Why Japanese Yarn Gains an Advantage</h3>
<p>The reasons for the differences in the operations of Chinese and Japanese factories: (1) Most of our country's yarn factories are limited liability companies, and dividends are required to be around 10% per year, while most of the Japanese factories are established in China by their domestic yarn factories, that is, they allocate funds from the surplus of their own factories to operate, and their official interest rates are extremely low. (2) Most of the people who run yarn factories in our country lacked specialized knowledge and experience in the past, so the organization and management aspects are not as complete as those of Japanese factories. (3) Our country's yarn factory raw materials are ordered from foreign merchants locally, and the color, tension, etc. change from time to time, resulting in poor quality products. Japanese merchants send specialists to the United States to purchase raw materials, select one type, and never change it permanently, so the exports are refined and easy to sell.</p>
<h3>Cotton Control Committee Will Engage in Relief</h3>
<p>The most advantageous thing for Japanese factories is that they have the assistance and maintenance of the Japanese government. Since the September 18th and January 28th incidents, Japanese merchants in China have suffered losses due to our country's boycott movement. As a result, the Japanese government allocated funds to relieve our country from otherwise falling. Therefore, the Cotton Industry Control Committee of the National Economic Council, in view of this, has decided to start to relieve the decline of the national yarn factory industry.</p>
<h3>Ma Heng Talks About the Inspection and Acceptance of Old Palace Artifacts - Entering Beijing Today and Returning North Immediately - Artifacts Will Not Be Moved Back to Ping for the Time Being</h3>
<p>Ma Heng, the director of the Palace Museum, arrived in Shanghai on the 2nd of this month to handle the handover of old palace artifacts. The Central News Agency reporter specifically visited Mr. Ma at his residence yesterday and was received. The following is what he said about the inspection and acceptance situation:</p>
<h3>Handover Completed</h3>
<p>According to Mr. Ma, his visit to Shanghai this time was actually to handle the handover matters. Former director Yi Peiji had already completed some of the handover procedures with him, but it was only a preliminary handover, limited to the documents, general affairs, accounting, secretarial, and other parts. As for the sampling inspection of old palace artifacts, only a portion of them were inspected, and it has not been fully completed. Xu Jiahan, the representative of the chairman of Beiping City, Yuan Liangzhi, who was dispatched by the Central Government to supervise the inventory, has completed his supervision at the site. He plans to return to the north today (i.e., yesterday).</p>
<h3>Awaiting Continued Inspection</h3>
<p>The reporter then asked whether the inspection of the artifacts this time was completed and whether there was no need to wait for further inspection. Mr. Ma replied that the handover of artifacts is a matter of great responsibility and is absolutely different from the handover of ordinary administrative agencies. Ordinary administrative agencies only need one month, or at most two months, to complete the inventory. Our museum has so many valuable objects that it cannot be completed in a short period of time. He has already discussed this case with Director Wang in Beijing and intends to handle this case separately. Soon, there may be a second inspection to show seriousness, otherwise, if it is done hastily and there are discrepancies, it will not be known who is responsible. Director Wang also intends to request the Executive Yuan to invite two members of the Control Yuan to Ping and Shanghai to conduct the inspection and acceptance when the next inspection is carried out, but the time has not yet been determined.</p>
<h3>Did Not Meet With Reporters in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Mr. Ma also said that he did not meet with other reporters during this visit to Shanghai. The various sections reported by a certain newspaper on the 4th are really surprising, which is why former director Yi made a correction. He really had no knowledge of it, and he cannot take any responsibility.</p>
<h3>Leaving for the North Today</h3>
<p>The reporter then asked Mr. Ma when he would leave Shanghai. He said that he would leave for Beijing tomorrow (i.e., today), stay in Beijing for a while, and then return north, and he would not come to Shanghai again. The next inspection will be handled by the two section chiefs Zhou and Zhuang in Shanghai, and he will not need to come to Shanghai again.</p>
<h3>Moving Artifacts to Ping Not Confirmed</h3>
<p>It was reported a few days ago that the cost of storing old palace artifacts in Shanghai is too high, and it is planned to transport them back to Beiping immediately, but that is not true. The board of directors of the Palace Museum has not held a meeting to discuss this matter. Transporting the artifacts here and back again in a short period of time would also be very expensive. Therefore, the government will not move the artifacts back to Beiping for the time being.</p>
<h3>Representatives of the National Salvation Army Arrive in Shanghai - Report Military Situation to Related Parties</h3>
<p>Yang Xunchen, the representative of the Wang Delin and Kong Xianrong troops of the Jilin National Salvation Army, came to Shanghai from the front yesterday to report the recent military situation and the shortage of winter clothing to related parties. The general situation is as follows: (1) Defeating the Enemy at Shahe: On September 23, the Japanese army sent a large number of troops from the Five Stations to attack the base of Zhang Yu's supervising commander. This was detected by our side, and Commander Zhang Mingjiu was immediately dispatched to lead troops to block the enemy at Shahe. After a day and night of fierce fighting, the enemy gradually retreated to the Middle East route. We took advantage of the victory to pursue them, capturing more than ten people and seizing a large number of guns and ammunition. (2) Attacking Mianpo: Our army failed to attack Dongning twice and plans to temporarily develop to the west. The aim is to destroy the Middle East Railway at Mianpo Laoye Ridge to stop the Japanese army from advancing. We have already contacted the commanders of the southeast and southwest routes and will jointly attack Mianpo, and then join forces to develop to the south and try to occupy Jilin. (3) Inspecting Defense Areas: Deputy Commander Kong Xianrong arrived in Dong Province at the end of September and inspected the defense areas separately. The inspection has now been completed and he is stationed at 口口. In recent days, he has been discussing with the generals the plans to reorganize the troops and recover lost territories. However, the Northeast is severely cold, and it has already snowed. The three armies lack warm clothing and ammunition. We hope that all sectors will provide winter clothing.</p>
<h3>Ning Shao Company Engineers Demand Equal Treatment - The Social Bureau and Seamen's Party Branch Will Mediate</h3>
<p>The engineers of the Ning Shao Shipping Company's Xin Ning Shao, Ning Shao, Ning Jing, and other ships, because the company cancelled the year-end double salary and changed it to an increase in wages, believe that the treatment is unequal. For example, the captain's monthly salary is 325 yuan, with an increase of 75 yuan, which is 900 yuan per year; the chief engineer's monthly salary is 180 yuan, with an increase of 10 yuan, which is 120 yuan per year; and the chief mate's monthly salary is 150 yuan, with an increase of 25 yuan, which is 300 yuan per year. They reported this to the General Union of Engineers, which forwarded it to the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau's Special Party Branch for Seamen and the Shanghai Maritime Administration Bureau, requesting mediation to achieve the principle of equal treatment. It is reported that the Social Bureau's Special Party Branch for Seamen has sent personnel to investigate and will conduct mediation in accordance with the law.</p>

<h3>Railway Department Stipulates Ferry Fees for Transportation Tickets, Gold, Silver, Etc. - Orders Railway Bureaus to Comply</h3>
<p>The Xin Xin News reports that the Shanghai-Ping direct train has been implemented. The Ministry of Railways has already stipulated the fees for transporting goods and passengers' luggage across the river by ferry in the capital. Now, it is specifically stipulated that the ferry fees for livestock, boats, vehicles, coffins, and various tickets, currency, gold, silver, etc. that are not divided into grades should be observed by the two railway administration bureaus. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Railway Department Order</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Railways ordered the two railway administration bureaus, stating that the fees for transporting goods, passengers' luggage, packages, locomotives, and vehicles across the river by ferry in the capital have been stipulated and ordered to be observed. Now, it is found that in pages 143 to 149 of the grading table, the ferry fees for livestock, boats, vehicles, coffins, and various tickets, currency, gold, silver, etc. that are not divided into grades should be stipulated separately. However, the capacity of the same tonnage vehicles on various roads is often different when transporting livestock, boats, vehicles, coffins, etc. in full cars, so it is difficult to stipulate the minimum number of cars in a uniform manner. Therefore, the ferry fee for each head, piece, or batch of the above-mentioned goods, such as livestock, boats, vehicles, and coffins, etc., listed in the table, whether in full cars or less than full cars, shall be calculated in order to facilitate the calculation of the joint transportation fee by the various roads. Now, the ferry fees for the above-mentioned goods are listed separately, and you are ordered to comply. After receiving the order, the bureau has ordered the transportation department to comply.</p>
<h3>List of Prices</h3>
<p>The prices for the ferry transportation of various tickets, currency, gold, silver, boats, vehicles, coffins, livestock, etc. are as follows: (1) Copper coins (freight): charged according to the third-class freight ferry fee; (passenger): charged double the price of freight cars; (2) Banknotes, government bonds, stocks, circulating securities, stamps, postcards, tax stamps: (freight): charged one dime for every 1,000 yuan of face value or less, with a minimum of one yuan; (passenger): charged two dimes for every 1,000 yuan of face value or less, with a minimum of two yuan; (3) Scrap banknotes, unsigned banknotes, unsigned issued securities: (passenger): three mills per kilogram, with a minimum of one dime; (4) Gold and silver bullion, gold leaf, gold and silver coins: (freight): charged one yuan for every 1,000 yuan of value or less, with a minimum of two yuan; (passenger): charged the price of freight cars; (5) Cars or motorcycles: (freight): five yuan per vehicle; (passenger): ten yuan per vehicle; (6) Motorized bicycles: (freight): eight dimes per vehicle; (passenger): one yuan and six dimes per vehicle; (7) Bicycles: (freight): four dimes per vehicle; (passenger): charged the price of freight cars; (8) Chinese carts or sedan chairs: (freight): eight dimes per vehicle; (9) Handcarts or small sedan chairs (freight): four dimes per vehicle; (10) Hand-pushed wheelbarrows: (freight): one dime per vehicle, hand-pushed two-wheeled carts: (freight): two dimes per vehicle, rickshaws: (freight): four dimes per vehicle; (passenger): six dimes per vehicle, children's carts: (freight): two dimes per vehicle; (11) Large palanquins: (freight): eight dimes per ride, rattan coolie sedan chairs: (freight): four dimes per ride; (12) Small boats: (freight): one yuan per boat, canoes (freight): one yuan per boat; (13) Empty coffins: (freight): one yuan per coffin; (passenger): two yuan per coffin, coffins: (freight): two yuan per coffin; (passenger): five yuan per coffin; (14) Folding baby carts: (freight): one dime per vehicle; (passenger): charged the price of freight cars, two-wheeled carriages: (freight): one yuan and six dimes per vehicle, four-wheeled carriages: (freight): one yuan and six dimes per vehicle, three-wheeled tricycles: (freight): six dimes per vehicle, ceremonial palanquins: eight dimes per ride, water buffaloes, camels, cows, with calves following: (freight): three dimes per head, horses, mules, yellow cattle: (freight): two dimes per head, calves, donkeys, ponies, deer (freight): one dime and five cents per head, dogs, cats, lambs, pigs, deer, sheep (freight): five cents per head.</p>

<h3>Jilin Sanjiang Guildhall Transports Coffins to Shanghai - A Total of 53 Coffins - Escorted by Executive Secretary Xie Bingchang</h3>
<p>The Jilin Provincial City Sanjiang Guildhall has transported the coffins of fellow villagers back to Shanghai at reduced fares for more than eleven times. The transport was suspended last year due to the situation. Now, it is the time for the twelfth coffin transport in the autumn. It departed from Jilin on October 15 of the solar calendar and sent executive secretary Xie Bingchang to take care of and escort the coffins to Shanghai along the way. All the coffins of households stored in Changchun were loaded onto the South Manchurian Railway at the same time as the coffins were transported from the provincial city to Changchun, and went straight to Yingkou. Then, they were transferred to Shanghai by the Xin Xing Company's ship, with Feng Longkui, the manager of the Qingyu Public Customs Brokerage at No. 8 Xinxing Lane, Zilai Street, French Concession, Shanghai, as the temporary communication address. It is reported that 29 coffins from the small city were escorted to Shanghai by Xie Bingchang the day before yesterday (the 4th). The 24 coffins from Changchun can also be transported within three to five days. However, because the Zhaoxing Company Wharf in Shanghai can only be stopped for a maximum of ten days, only a small number of the transported coffins will end up in Shanghai. The families of the deceased in Shanghai can wait for the coffins to arrive and arrange for the transfer of affairs within the period, so that they will not waste their travel expenses in vain. In order to facilitate the distribution of coffins after they arrive in Shanghai, the guildhall has applied to the Changchun and Jilin Police Department and the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau to issue passports for transporting the coffins to their original residences. After arriving in Shanghai, the executive secretary escorting the coffins will distribute the coffin transport passports and the original diagnosis certificates to each family. When transporting the coffins to their original residences, two copies of the passport should be sealed and registered and mailed back to the Jilin Sanjiang Guildhall or Xie Jingli's office at the Jilin Jidong Printing House, Henan Street, Jilin, within two months from the date of issuance, in order to cancel the account and avoid abuse. The names and origins of the transported coffins are recorded below: Xu Li Shi, Wu Shen Shi, Tan Qiu Shi, Lu Chen Shi, Lu He Shi, Lu Chen Shi, Qian Runquan, Wu Boheng, Wu Jigao, Wu Jixiang, Xu Jin Shi, Fu Ding Shi, He Yingyuan, Zhang Changcan, Chen Shangbao, Zhang Wukui, Yang Mingfen, Yang Chen Shi, Zheng Laixian, Shan Tonghou, Fan Li Shi, Gao Yin Shi, Zhu Pan Shi, Chen Zhou Shi, Mei Zhongying, Shen Wang Shi, Wang Hu Shi, Wang Meng Shi, Huang Li Shi (the above 29 coffins were transported from the provincial city), Gu Shimin, Jin Shilin, Zhu Yunyuan, Shen Kaifu, Li Li Shi, Zhou Yutian, Zhu Yaoju, Chen Huaisheng, Lin Rangzhi, Zhang Yusheng, Qian Jien, Wu Yiqin, Zhou Guojian, Zhang Liansheng, Zhang Ansheng, Hu Shaoxun, Chen Qingtang, Yin Guofan, Yin Runzhai, Ding Liu Shi, Yang Song'e, Chen Xingfen, Cao Qiwei, Xiao Li (the above 24 coffins were transported from Changchun).</p>
<h3>Song Zheyuan Thanks for Condolences for War Dead</h3>
<p>Song Zheyuan previously held a memorial service in Chahar Province for the soldiers who died in the war against Japan, and many parties sent eulogies and condolences. Mr. Song had a letter to Shanghai yesterday to thank them separately. The letter reads: "Respectfully, the door to the unfortunate is opened, and the brave soldiers do not return. A solemn sacrifice is made, and all the virtuous people gather. Pepper wine and cassia wine are offered to the spirits in the underworld. Exquisite books and jade chapters are praised in one word. I cherish the meaning of expressing loyalty and deeply feel the comradeship. Friendship is thinner than clouds and passes on from ancient times. Zheyuan's mentor is humble and the road is difficult. The mountains and rivers of the four fortresses, the Han general's head is not afraid of being cut off, and the Second Tomb wind and rain, when will the Qin doctor collect the bones? Therefore, I reported to the central government and held a memorial service. Now, I am grateful for the distant journey, and I am honored by the writings. I fear that the reception of the envoy's car will be neglected. I deeply feel the sorrow and sincerity of passing on the order of the post. I hereby express my gratitude. I respectfully wish you peace at all times."</p>
<h3>Shipping Bureau Arbitration of Four-Way Ship Collision Dispute - Authorities from All Four Ships Not Fully Present - Result Unresolved, Meeting to be Reconvened</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Shipping Administration Bureau's Ship Collision Dispute Resolution Committee held its fourth meeting yesterday morning at 9:00 AM within the bureau. Committee members Zhu Yaoting, He Huijia, Chen Ganqing, and Yu Shifan were present. Secretary Qian Zhilian of the Shipping Administration Bureau, as well as the first and second mates of the Fengxiang and Haizhou vessels, attended as observers. Two agenda items were discussed. One was the request for arbitration concerning a collision in the Huangpu River between the Fengxiang vessel, belonging to the Taifeng Shipping Company, and the Huian vessel, belonging to the Zhengji Shipping Company. The incident occurred on the Huangpu River off the Dongxing Railway pier in Pudong, Shanghai, on the afternoon of July 27th of this year. There were two collisions: the first at 2:21 PM and the second at 2:30 PM. Both occurred because the Huian vessel, while departing the pier for Yantai and attempting to turn, was struck by the Fengxiang vessel, belonging to the Taifeng Shipping Company, which was entering the port with the tide, unable to avoid the collision. Both vessels sustained damage. After the collision, the Huian immediately dropped anchor. At the same time, the Fengxiang vessel also turned to the right, resulting in a second collision. During yesterday morning's arbitration meeting, only the first mate of the Fengxiang vessel was present. The authorities of the Huian vessel were absent due to other matters. The second case concerned a request for arbitration regarding the Yongsheng vessel, belonging to the Dazhen Shipping Company, and the Haizhou vessel, belonging to the China United Shipping Company, colliding at the Longhai pier in Dapu Harbor, Haizhou, where their cables were severed and their hulls were damaged. The collision occurred at 8:00 PM on September 9th of this year. The incident occurred because Dapu Harbor in Haizhou is very shallow, and ships can only enter and exit during high tide. Outside pier number one of the Longhai pier in Dapu Harbor, there is a sandbar in the middle of the channel, where the water is only one or two feet deep. At 3:00 PM on September 9th, the Haizhou vessel entered the harbor and docked at Longhai pier number one to unload cargo, while the Yongping vessel was docked outside the Haizhou vessel. At 5:00 PM, the cargo was unloaded, and the Yongping vessel was allowed to dock at the pier, while the Haizhou vessel used hawsers from the outer vessel to maneuver, causing mutual restraint. In the evening, the tide surged, and the two ships collided and automatically broke away from the pier, resulting in damage to both. Only the first mate of the Haizhou vessel was present at yesterday morning's arbitration. The officer of the Yongping vessel was also absent due to other matters. Therefore, the committee members could only question one party regarding the two cases and could not conduct an arbitration. It is said that another meeting will be convened in the coming days, requiring the first mates of the Huian and Yongping vessels to attend to resolve the matter as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Gao Yuan's Invention of the "Positive and Negative Law Theory"</h3>
<p>｜Creating a New Record in World Legal Studies｜</p>
<p>In the last ten years, China's academic circles have made great progress, moving from plagiarism and translation to an era of creation. In the natural sciences and industry, there have been inventions like the "Flying Thunder," while in the social sciences, there has been the spirit of the "New Youth of Jiayin" (1914), evolving into the style of "Dynamic Reading." Since the emergence of Chen Baoyin's "New Political Science" in 1929, which opened a new chapter in political science with the theory of disruptive equilibrium, and Guo Moruo's "Study of Ancient Chinese Society" in 1930, which examined the social characteristics of the Yin, Zhou, and Three Dynasties from unearthed artifacts, there have been rare contributions to academia. Recently, lawyer Gao Yuan invented the "Positive and Negative Law Theory," setting a new record in the world of legal studies. Although there have always been many schools of legal thought, they have generally revolved around the debate between natural law theory and realistic law theory. Gao, however, denies both of these schools and uniquely creates the "Positive and Negative Law Theory." In essence, he argues that natural law is not truly law, and realistic law cannot fully represent the true essence of law. Law often has a negative side in addition to its positive side, which has been overlooked by legal scholars throughout history. It is noted that lawyer Gao Yuan is none other than Gao Chengyuan, the revolutionary diplomat also known as Zhu Li. Since retiring from realistic politics, he has devoted himself to the study of law and, after three years, achieved this innovation. He is a person rich in creative spirit. In 1924, he wrote "Guoyin Xue" (National Phonetics), for which the famous phonologist Qian Xuantong wrote the preface, praising it as an unprecedented work and claiming it had six major inventions. Hu Shih called it two major liberations. Gao Jun has extensive knowledge, delving into social sciences and literature, and has a particularly deep understanding of philosophy. When he studied law and political science at Peking University, he simultaneously studied philosophy, becoming a prominent student of lawyer Zhang Shizhao. He has written "Bianxue Guyi Lun" (On the Remnants of Argumentation), "The Logic of Mozi, Xunzi, and Gongsun Longzi," and "On the Laws of Thought," offering a profound refutation of Hegel. After these two works were published, he became known to the world as a logician. Cai Yuanpei, the president of Peking University, promoted him to lecturer in the Faculty of Arts without regard for seniority, to teach logic. In 1924, the famous scholar of the new school of legal thought, Hans Kelsen, traveled to the Vienna Institute of Legal Research to study the logical school of legal theory, writing "On Leased Territories," using logic to critique law, which was praised by Europeans. In 1929, he wrote "The Materialistic Philosophical Foundation of Sun Wen's Doctrine," which was translated by the Japanese Journal of National Studies. From this point on, Gao was known internationally as a philosopher of history. In 1931, he wrote "On the Fundamental Reform of Legal Studies," reversing the formal logic school of his teacher and advocating the use of contradictory logic to study law. He cited the theories of famous scholars from England, America, and Germany, criticizing them one by one, and establishing his own unique banner, advocating the so-called positive and negative law theory. Scholars even compared it to Einstein's invention of the theory of relativity, praising it as a groundbreaking innovation in the field of law, which was widely circulated and became an authority in legal studies. In 1932, Jinan University hired him to lecture on the philosophy of law, and the lecture hall was full, with listeners crowding outside. Recently, to complete his research on the philosophy of law, he has been practicing law, hoping to obtain empirical data from numerous cases. Soochow University and Fudan University, admiring his name, have both hired him to give lectures on law this semester. At Soochow, he is lecturing on the history of legal thought, and at Fudan, he is lecturing on the philosophy of law. It is said that he began lecturing the previous week.</p>
<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Jiangwan Branch Re-Requests Exemption from Boat Tax</h3>
<p>The Jiangwan Branch of the City Chamber of Commerce previously submitted a request for exemption from the boat tax. The city government instructed the Finance Bureau to respond, stating that it differed in nature from small carts and was not suitable for applying the same precedent, so the request was denied. The City Chamber of Commerce had already forwarded a response. Now, the branch office argues that the previous request is highly relevant to the livelihoods of the poor, and that boat owners are suffering from the impact of steamboats and ferries, leading to sluggish business and a struggle to sustain their families. At a time when the central government is striving to exempt harsh and trivial taxes, the boat tax should receive the same treatment as small cart businesses. Therefore, they are again appealing on behalf of the boat owners, and have submitted a report to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, which has now been forwarded to the municipal government for review.</p>

<h3>Falsely Setting Up a Red Pill Manufacturing Operation to Obtain Reward Money and Frame Others - The World's Morals and People's Hearts Are Declining Daily - Evil Deeds Emerge Endlessly</h3>
<p>Western Detective No. 157 of the French Concession Police received a confidential report a few days ago, stating that someone was privately setting up a red pill manufacturing operation in the pavilion room on the third floor of the clothing store at No. 21 Jiping Lane, Beile Road. He immediately led Chinese detectives, including Wang Fangnan, to search the address. Upon arrival, they found a man smoking red pills and immediately arrested him. They also confiscated three and a half pounds of red pills, two and a half pounds of wet powder, one pound of white powder, six small packets of colored medicinal powder, and pill-making equipment, including an oven. The man, who identified himself as Li Awu, 33 years old, a local resident, was asked who his boss was. Li replied that he did not know and that they should ask the second landlord, who would know the details. The detectives then questioned the second landlord, Su Huiqing, 58 years old, from Changzhou, who also claimed to be unaware. The detectives then took Li and the second landlord, along with the confiscated red pill equipment, lamp gun, and other items, to the police station. The next day, they were sent to the Second Special District Court for interrogation and investigation. Subsequently, the Chinese and Western detectives handling the case discovered that the case was a fabricated report to obtain reward money and frame others. The scheme was orchestrated by Fang Jiugao (37 years old, from Ningbo, residing at No. 397 Mintini Yin Road), Kang Yaoting (from Ningbo, residing at No. 14 Chengyu Lane, Mintini Yin Road), Tang Amao (36 years old, from Ningbo, residing at No. 19 Baer Road), and Zhu Are (34 years old, from Suzhou, residing at No. 14 Chunde Lane, Lanwei Ai Road). The four were arrested and sent to court the day before yesterday. The police lawyer charged them with privately manufacturing opium substitutes under Article 6 of the Anti-Smoking Law and with the crime of fraud under the Criminal Code. According to Fang Jiugao's confession, a Western detective asked him if he knew anyone who could report a private red pill manufacturing operation in exchange for a reward. He then asked Tang Amao, who said there was, but they had to get the reward money first and then go to search and confiscate. Fang then went with Tang to report to the Western detective, explaining that they had to get the reward money first. The Western detective paid 20 yuan in foreign currency, but Tang insisted on 30 yuan, so Fang paid the remaining 10 yuan. Later, they went together to search and confiscate, and so on. Tang Amao confessed that the red pill manufacturer was named Agou and was introduced by Qu Jin, who told him to report it. The entire reward money was given to Qu Jin. Tang Yaoting confessed that Tang Amao's wife asked him to introduce addicts to smoke red pills, and he knew nothing else. Zhu Are confessed that he met Tang Amao and Li Awu on Lanwei Ai Road. Tang Amao asked him to smoke red pills, but he refused. Tang then pulled Li Awu along. He knew nothing else about what happened later. Li Awu confessed that he was taken to smoke red pills by Kang Yaoting on Lanwei Ai Road and was then arrested. The second landlord, Su Huiqing, confessed that a man and a woman came to rent a room at 5:00 PM on the 36th of last month. His daughter-in-law handled the transaction, and they moved in. The next day, the police came to arrest them. He knew nothing about the private manufacture of red pills. The presiding judge reviewed the confessions and declared the debate closed, awaiting a scheduled sentencing. The defendants were returned to custody pending further instructions.</p>
<h3>Zhonghua Sawmill Company Fire Causes Losses of Over 100,000 Gold - Spreads to Zhenshengyu Sawmill - Also Suffering Losses of 30,000 to 40,000</h3>
<p>The Zhonghua Sawmill Company Limited, located at No. 1225 Kangqu Road, Rihui Bridge, outside the South City, was a large-scale operation with a total capital of over 200,000 and over 300 employees. It specialized in sawing wooden boards for packing boxes for various tobacco companies, with over a dozen large and small sawing machines. The business was thriving, making it the largest sawmill company near Dapu Bridge. Its office was located on the third floor of the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China on Nanjing Road Bund. Unexpectedly, at around 5:40 AM yesterday morning, a fire broke out in the factory and spread rapidly. An hour later, the fire intensified and spread from the board box room to the warehouse room. At around 8:00 AM, it spread to the Zhenshengyu Sawmill to the west. The most dangerous element was the 500 gallons of gasoline stored between the two factories. Fortunately, the firefighters exerted all their efforts to put out the fire, preventing a major disaster. The fire was only slightly extinguished at 3:00 PM in the afternoon. In this incident, Zhonghua factory suffered losses of about 100,000, and Zhenshengyu about 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. Subsequently, Li Jing, the district chief of the Second District, dispatched a police chief to investigate the cause of the fire and took Zhang Qingfu (22 years old, from Ningbo), an employee of the factory, and Chen Qinquan (23 years old, from Wujin) into custody for questioning and investigation.

<h3>Peiping Dancer Accuses Brother of Fang Jiaobo - Verdict: Fang Guizhang Found Not Guilty - But Must Pay the Dancer 200 Yuan</h3>
<p>｜Man and Woman Break into Another Argument After Court｜</p>
<p>Zheng Wenying, a local woman, is a middle-aged woman with lingering charm. She was once a concubine to the younger brother of a certain finance minister during Yuan Shikai's time. However, due to disagreements, she left and later, due to financial hardship, became a dancer at the Central Dance Hall in Peiping three years ago. With her skillful social skills, she captivated countless young men. In May 1931, Fang Jiaobo (i.e., lawyer Fang Jifan), a wealthy Shanghai businessman, traveled to Peiping with his younger brother Fang Guizhang and several friends, often visiting dance halls. Fang Guizhang was immediately smitten with Zheng upon seeing her and showed her every kindness. They then agreed to marry and came to Shanghai together, renting a house together at No. 702 Xianyi Lane, Xin Chongqing Road. Soon after, they moved to No. 719 in the same lane, with Fang paying a monthly household allowance of 150 yuan. Unexpectedly, in May of this year, Fang suddenly disappeared. Zheng discovered that Fang had become entangled with a prostitute named Songjiang Lao Wu and abandoned her. She hired lawyer Mao Xianshen to sue Fang Guizhang for abandonment in the First Special Court, stating that after meeting the plaintiff, the defendant enticed her in every way. The plaintiff initially resisted, but the defendant falsely claimed that his legal wife was seriously ill and would soon die, and that he wished to marry the plaintiff as a concubine first, and then make her his legal wife when the time was right. The plaintiff eventually gave in and came to Shanghai to live with him. Unexpectedly, the flowers did not bloom for long, and the moon did not remain full. Now he has abandoned her, so she is filing a lawsuit, asking that he be punished under Article 310 of the Criminal Code, and is also requesting alimony of 54,000 yuan. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu Zehan of the First Special Court opened the trial. Fang Guizhang also appeared in court with his defense lawyer, Yang Ruinian. First, Zheng Wenying recounted the events. When questioned, Fang Guizhang denied taking Zheng as a concubine, stating that he had known the plaintiff in Shanghai for a long time. Later, he met her again while traveling in Peiping. Although there was a relationship, there was no taking her as a concubine. Moreover, the plaintiff and he came to Shanghai separately, and there was no cohabitation. No. 719 Xianyi Lane, Xin Chongqing Road, was the house rented by the plaintiff, not rented by him. Finally, the plaintiff's lawyer Mao Xianshen and lawyer Yang Ruinian debated each other based on legal principles. Judge Wu announced the verdict in court, finding Fang Guizhang not guilty, but he should pay Zheng Wenying 200 yuan in foreign currency. The plaintiff's request for alimony was rejected. After the court adjourned, Zheng grabbed Fang after he stepped out of the courtroom and refused to let go, arguing and making a scene. Lawyer Yang then called for the police to come and separate the two parties. Fang then quickly left in a rickshaw. A typical bedroom in the Yangtze Hotel (news reported in yesterday's newspaper)</p>

The issuance method will be the same as the second phase. (2) There are 667 prizes in the construction lottery, from first to seventh class, and the seventh-class prize accounts for 500 numbers. Drawing each one individually would take at least seven hours. For the convenience of lottery buyers to watch, the 500 numbers for the seventh-class prize of the construction lottery will be drawn using a convenient and simple method: 1,000 small wooden balls will be made specifically for drawing the seventh-class prize, engraved with the last three digits of the lottery ticket numbers, from 000 to 999, and placed inside a large ball. At the time, only one small wooden ball will be drawn. If the small ball drawn is number 789, then all lottery tickets with the last three digits being 789 will win the seventh-class prize.

<h3>Explanation Regarding the Establishment of Railway Business Offices (Continued from October 30th)</h3>
<p>Its benefits to society and the country are truly immense. Although there are countless public and private organizations and commercial entities in the country, most are engaged in localized operations, only able to solve a portion of a certain issue. I have not heard of a single store or organization that directly or indirectly addresses the four major necessities of life – clothing, food, housing, and transportation. If there is such an entity, it can only be the railway business office. Let me elaborate. "Clothing": Suppose a certain place produces silk but cloth is expensive, and another place produces cloth but silk is expensive. If you want to exchange what you have for what you lack, adjusting surpluses and deficits, then you rely entirely on the operation of railways and other transportation agencies. If the operation is appropriate, then silk, cloth, cotton, linen, and even all other products on the market can be adjusted. Once adjusted, prices can naturally be fair. The railway business office will, in the future, conduct surveys based on various production, sales, and market conditions, and can properly determine transportation policies, solving the clothing problem for society, men and women. This is its first unique feature. "Food": People regard food as heaven, and the people regard food as the foundation. Food is greatly related to the evolution of the people. From this, it can be known that, for example, Jiangsu and Zhejiang are major producers of silk, tea, rice, and grains, while Fujian and Guangdong are known for producing sugar and seafood. If there is no transportation adjustment in between, there will inevitably be surpluses and shortages. Now, the railway business office can gradually reduce the above-mentioned shortcomings. Any food produced along the railway lines can be handled on behalf of the customer. What was difficult to purchase in the past can now be obtained from morning to evening, which is extremely convenient. This is its second unique feature. "Housing": When people travel and arrive at a certain place for the first time, they are often unfamiliar with the place, and the situation is unclear. Wherever they go, it is difficult to discern directions. Choosing a hotel is difficult to accept or reject. The pain felt is truly great. As a result, the mentality of "being good at home for a thousand days, but having a hard time when going out" has deeply penetrated the people and is difficult to change. Now, the business office specifically provides a hotel reservation service, which is to remedy the travel shortcomings of unfamiliarity with the place. If members of society can utilize this service, they will feel great convenience. This is its third unique feature. "Transportation": Scientific progress and improvements in boats and vehicles, especially in railways, are most significant. What was previously difficult to reach on foot can now be reached by fast and reliable trains. If you want to travel around, you only need to contact the business office to purchase tickets, and you can set off. Moreover, all luggage can also be properly delivered and received on your behalf. The convenience of the procedures and the benefits are truly unsurpassed. In addition, railway business is most suitable for large-volume transportation. Now that the railway business office has made receiving and sending freight an important part of its business, it will naturally be of greater convenience to society to utilize the large-volume transportation of railways. This is its fourth unique feature. (3) The course of establishing the business office: Seeing the urgent need for business offices in various areas, Bao Zhao discussed the promotion and accomplishment of the steps with various leaders in the ministry in May 1932. Director Yu and Assistant Tan and others approved and assisted. Because the matter was significant and was a pioneering effort, Bao Zhao believed that its efficiency could not be fully demonstrated without concentrating talent and strength. So he convened several comrades to prepare all the implementation methods. Due to various circumstances, he was unable to realize it immediately at that time, and he still regrets it to this day. When Mr. Huang Boqiao and Mr. Wu Shaozeng came to be in charge of the Nanjing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways, Bao Zhao immediately suggested it again, and it was realized with their support. First, it started in Shanghai. On one hand, he rented No. 407 Jing'an Temple Road as the location of the office, and on the other hand, he selected staff, defined the rules, and after the arrangements were completed, the opening ceremony was held on August 21st. Representatives from all walks of life came to provide guidance. He was honored by the assistance of all walks of life and was very fortunate. However, this office is in its infancy, and it is inevitable that there will be omissions. I hope that members of society will not be stingy with their advice and correct my shortcomings. I would be very grateful. Furthermore, the motivation and characteristics of the establishment of the business office have been briefly described above. However, this organization was established for the people and not for the promotion of this railway. Therefore, if there are any unsatisfactory services, please do not hesitate to provide guidance at any time to achieve perfection. This is what I sincerely wish for. (4) The promotion plan for the railway business office: On September 1st of this year, the ministry summoned representatives from various railways to hold a national internal joint meeting in the capital. The heads of the various railway operations departments and the representatives of the listed degrees gathered together to discuss various major plans with concentration. This is truly a page of great value in railway history. Taking advantage of this opportunity, Bao Zhao submitted the business office plan he had drafted to the representatives for concrete consultation. All of them agreed and supported it. At that time, the Beijing-Ningbo, Tianjin-Pukou, Beijing-Suiyuan, Beijing-Hankou and other railways all agreed to cooperate and establish business offices in major cities such as Tianjin, Beijing, and Jinan in the shortest possible time, and then gradually promote them to cities, counties, towns, and villages in order to achieve the goal of popularity. It has now been decided that the Tianjin-Pukou, Shanghai-Nanjing, and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways will jointly establish a business office in Nanjing, and the Shanghai Business Office of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways will also establish a branch in the Nanshi District of Shanghai. In short, the establishment of railway business offices is not only an important way to develop railway business, but also a way to solve the four basic needs of clothing, food, housing, and transportation. Its active promotion and popularization throughout the country truly relies on our efforts.</p>
<h3>Paper Industry Resists Japanese Goods - Letter to the City Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>The Paper Industry Trade Association sent a letter to the City Chamber of Commerce yesterday regarding the New Culture Bookstore using Japanese goods. The letter reads: "Respectfully, according to a report from the Inspection Team of the affiliated association, the team received a confidential report yesterday stating that the New Culture Bookstore in Zhongshi, Simalu, has imported a large number of Japanese newspaper sheets and entrusted the Huawen Printing Factory at No. 3 Qirong Lane (i.e., No. 595 Lane), Huade Road and Liaoyang Road intersection, and the Sanmin Printing Factory at No. 3 Sanshou Lane, north of Zhonghongqiao on Disiwei Road, to print new-style punctuated ancient books. Please stop this." The team immediately dispatched personnel to investigate, and it was confirmed that the Huawen Printing Factory did indeed have Japanese newspaper sheets in stock. They also obtained a sheet of Japanese newspaper sheet being printed, the 'Investiture of the Gods,' from Huawen. When asked, Huawen said that the Japanese paper was sent by the New Culture Bookstore. They also found no Japanese paper stored in the Sanmin Printing Factory. The team members also purchased a copy of 'Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio' printed in October 1933 from the New Culture Bookstore, and the paper used for printing was indeed Japanese newspaper sheets. It is clear that what Huawen said is true. In light of this, since our four provinces are still lost and the blood and tears of Zhabei have not yet dried, the New Culture Bookstore, which promotes culture, dares to purchase a large number of Japanese paper sheets, which is truly a case of being blinded by profit, making it heartbreaking and infuriating and truly hateful. We have attached the evidence, including a stack of single sheets of 'Investiture of the Gods' consisting of eight sheets and a copy of 'Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio' consisting of four books, and respectfully request that you forward them to the City Chamber of Commerce and the both Trade Associations of the Book Industry and Lead Printing Industry, to investigate and punish this, and also draft and distribute them to various newspapers or news agencies so that they are subjected to social sanctions to warn against imitation. The matter is attached with evidence to come. Reasonably, a single sheet of Japanese goods, 'Investiture of the Gods,' is attached, and we respectfully ask your association to examine and handle it to serve as a warning against imitation and maintain the barrier against Japanese goods, and we hope for a reply. Respectfully to the Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce, (rest omitted)."</p>

<h3>Sailboat Damaged by Collision with Guangxiang Steamer: Towed to Wusong to Negotiate with the Company</h3>
<p>The Ningbo sailboat "Jin Bao Ju," loaded with 3,800 dan of rice and beans from Zhenjiang, set sail on the 2nd of this month. At 6:00 PM on the 4th, it arrived at Yanglinkou, opposite Sanjiakou, and anchored. At 9:30 PM that night, the Dada Company's steamer "Guang Xiang" suddenly arrived and violently collided with the port bow of the "Jin Bao Ju."

<h3>Shanghai Public Security Bureau's Announcement on Handling Anonymous Letters: Provide Evidence in Letters; Anonymous Letters are Invalid</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Public Security Bureau recently issued an instruction to its subordinate district offices and teams (No. 1987): Regarding the matter of instructions, the bureau has recently received numerous anonymous letters, some accusing subordinate police officers and others reporting local situations. Although many cases have been investigated and found to be the result of justifiable reasons, there are also many cases of fabricated accusations without factual basis. Some aim to disrupt local security through secret wrongdoing, while others are entirely fabricated with the intention of framing others. If this continues, it will become a common practice, allowing the cunning to succeed, discouraging the hardworking, promoting the wicked, and endangering the good, which is not the way to improve customs, strengthen people's hearts, promote the virtuous, and eliminate the treacherous. It is hereby stipulated that if a police officer of this bureau truly has illegal conduct or a local resident has unlawful actions, people are allowed to report it at any time for legal handling. If there is fear of retaliation from the accused, letters can be used to list evidence and facts for thorough investigation. The bureau will maintain confidentiality and ensure no obstruction. Those who report significant cases will be rewarded according to regulations. However, complainants must provide their real name, detailed address, and a local shop for verification. Anonymous letters will not be valid. In addition to public announcement, the district office directors are instructed to take note of this order.</p>

<h3>Zhang Jinxiu Invents New Style Beehive: Successful Trial, Abundant Honey Production</h3>

<h3>Impersonating Military Police to Extort Money: Arrested</h3>
<p>Yan Wei, a woman from Ningbo residing in the Santai Wharf Lane in the South City, has a daughter named Yingdi, who is nineteen years old and of marriageable age. The other day, a young man claiming to be Lu Linkui suddenly came to their home, using a fake diamond ring worth a few cents as a genuine diamond ring to force the daughter to accept it, claiming it was an engagement ring. He then took out a small knife to threaten her, demanding $100. The woman refused, stating that she had no marital relations with him and did not have $100. The man then wrote that he was the deputy commissioner of the recruiting office of the South Guild Hall and an inspector of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, demanding that the money be prepared by the next day, and then left. The woman was terrified and told her neighbors, who were indignant. The next day, the man returned and was apprehended by the neighbors, who called the police and found a forged pass issued by the Customs Registry Bureau and eight red pills.

<h3>Yang Guilong Exposed for Trafficking in Child Brides</h3>
<p>Yang Anan, the sixteen-year-old daughter of Yang Zhengming from Jiangbei, was adopted as a child bride into the home of Yang Guilong in Caonitang, Yangjiadu, Pudong, this year through a matchmaker. After entering the family, she was treated poorly. Recently, Yang Guilong met a gang of kidnappers and saw that the girl was ignorant and could still be exploited for profit. He thought that the child bride, who cost only a few dozen dollars in bride price, could be sold for several hundred dollars, making a ten-fold profit. He arranged for the kidnappers Tao San, Zhuang Zheng, and others to take the girl on board the Fuli steamer docked at the Dakura Wharf in Pudong the other day. Unexpectedly, Yang Zhengming learned of the plan and rushed to the ship, where he found Yang Guilong and his daughter Anan. He immediately called the police, who arrested Yang Guilong at the first district office. Tao San and Zhuang Zheng took the opportunity to escape. The station was requested to apprehend them. The police were dispatched to Tao's home in Caonitang. Upon entering the house, they found that Tao's home was an opium den. Tao and Zhuang were arrested together, and opium paraphernalia was seized. After the plaintiff identified them clearly, they were handed over to the Public Security Bureau and transferred to the District Court for interrogation yesterday.</p>
<h3>Counterfeit Coin Case Transferred to the First Special District Court</h3>
<p>Chen Yonggui and Sun Aizhong, Chinese detectives from the Gwardia Municipal Council, previously cracked a case of selling counterfeit coins and manufacturing counterfeit 20-cent pieces in a house at 182 Shanqingli, Avenue Edward VII. They arrested Deng Rongting, a native of Shandong, and his wife Zhang, and seized twenty counterfeit five-yuan notes of the Bank of Communications, two central double-cent bills, one copper coin, and equipment for manufacturing double-cent pieces, including a model battery, a silver ingot, and an iron pot. Upon interrogation, they learned that the equipment was stored by Li Shaozhou, a fellow villager residing at 11 Jiurul, Qiujiang Road, Zhabei. The detectives secretly went there and, together with detectives from the Fifth District Public Security Bureau, apprehended Li and his wife Zhou at their address. One counterfeit yuan, six silver yuan, and four counterfeit double-cent pieces were found on them. They were taken to the jurisdiction of the Public Security Bureau for detention. Deng Rongting and his wife, along with various pieces of evidence, were transferred to the First Special District Court for interrogation. As reported in this newspaper yesterday, the police transferred Shaozhou and his wife to the Criminal Court No. 3. Zhang Tianyin, the police attorney, stated that the two defendants denied in the police station that Deng Rongting's counterfeit cent-making equipment belonged to them, and that the house was not rented by them. The police confronted Deng with them. Deng said that the case had been solved and that there was no need to implicate others, urging them to acknowledge him as the principal offender. His words were very intense. He requested that the court detain them and reschedule the interrogation to be conducted jointly with Deng Rongting. Judge Liu Yugui questioned them briefly and ordered them to be returned to detention separately, with the date for a joint trial to be set.</p>
<h3>Four-Year-Old Fraud Case Solved</h3>
<p>| Ning Guichun Attempts to Defraud Again, Arrested |</p>

The victim reported the incident to the police for investigation and requested the court to issue an arrest warrant. His whereabouts remained unknown until the afternoon of the other day, when the con man suddenly appeared at the Qiaoda Trading Company at 19 Yuanmingyuan Road, attempting to steal something. He was discovered and detained. A telephone call was made to the Central Police Station, and detectives were dispatched to take Ning back. The old case of several years was solved at once. Evidence is currently being collected. Once the investigation is completed, he will be transferred to the court for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Dispute Over the Expulsion of Street Vendors on Jingjiang Road</h3>
<p>He Zhaorong, an assistant section member of the Fourth District Police Station on Zhongxing Road, Zhabei, was ordered to ban street vendors on Jingjiang Road. He dispatched police officers Liang Guolian, etc., to expel them. Unexpectedly, the vendors gathered to resist, inciting deaf and mute elderly people in their seventies and eighties to resist desperately, saying that they had already paid money to the bureau and that another attempt to expel them would only be met with death. When officer Liang asked who took their money, they claimed that it was paid to the leader of the vendors, Zhou Changmao, and turned over to the bureau. Officer Liang returned to the station to report. He, upon receiving the report, believed that this was a case of impersonation and fraud, and should be thoroughly investigated. He immediately summoned Zhou Changmao for interrogation. According to Zhou's confession, he did receive money, but it was not turned over to the bureau. It was to be used for a lawsuit against Yang Dexin of the Hexing Vegetable Market. It was a misunderstanding. He, upon hearing the confession, reported it to Lai, the district chief of the Fourth District, stating that to expel the street vendors on Jingjiang Road, the leader of the vendors, Zhou Changmao, must be arrested and severely punished before any success could be achieved, and requested instructions. Lai, the district chief, immediately forwarded the report to the General Bureau for instructions on how to handle the matter.</p>

According to his conversation, the matter of independent Zhejiang education funds, the proposal to allocate tax revenue as education funds, must wait until Supervisor Dai Xia of the Ministry of Education returns to Hangzhou from Quzhou before jointly discussing with the finance and education departments to make a decision. The tax is a large source of revenue for the provincial treasury, and part of it has already been mortgaged, so it will take time to allocate the tax as education funds.</p>

<h3>Preparations for the Berlin Chinese Art Exhibition</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter visited a responsible person at the Ministry of Education to inquire about the preparations for the Berlin Chinese Art Exhibition. According to their reply:</p>
<p>In recent years, the Japanese have frequently used their immature Oriental paintings to promote themselves in major European countries, seemingly claiming to represent East Asian art. In January of the 20th year [of the Republic], the Japanese government, with a subsidy of 80,000 marks and under the name of the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts, held a large-scale modern painting exhibition at the Prussian Academy of Arts in Berlin. They also transported the paintings to major cities and towns in Germany for exhibition, causing the German people to admire them and believe that Japanese art could represent the Orient. Fortunately, there were also many people in Germany who studied Oriental art and appreciated Chinese art. They once spontaneously held a Chinese art exhibition, displaying Chinese ancient paintings, bronzes, sculptures, jades, porcelains, embroideries, etc., for more than a month, causing quite a sensation. However, due to the hasty collection, the content was not very sufficient, which the Germans regretted. They inquired with the Chinese Embassy in Germany, believing that if they could obtain the promotion and sponsorship of the Chinese government and the educational and artistic circles, the Germans would be willing to hold another Chinese exhibition to refresh the German art world. Therefore, the Chinese College of Frankfurt, Germany, initiated a Chinese art exhibition in March of the 20th year [of the Republic], and the number of visitors was very large and continuous. However, although Frankfurt is one of the major cities, it is ultimately not as important as the capital, and it is not enough to fully promote the ability of Chinese art. Our Chinese Embassy in Germany, together with leaders from the German art and political circles, agreed to hold a large-scale Chinese modern painting exhibition at the Prussian Academy of Arts in Berlin in February of the 23rd year [of the Republic], and decided that Chinese and German people would jointly organize a preparatory committee to prepare everything. The German side was hosted by the German East Asian Art Association, and the Chinese side was hosted by the Academia Sinica. This is the initiation of the Berlin Chinese Art Exhibition.</p>
<p>The German members of the preparatory committee were Dr. Wilhelm Solf, President of the German East Asian Art Association; Dr. Jng Herbert Von Klemperer, Vice President of the German East Asian Art Association; Dr. Etto Kummel, Director of the German East Asian Museum; Dr. Herbert Ginsberg, Chief Accountant of the German East Asian Art Association; Dr. Eduard Freihere Vonder Heydt, Deputy Director; Dr. Curt Glaser, Director of the National Art Museum; and representatives from the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Chinese members were appointed by the 42nd meeting of the Executive Yuan in June of the 21st year [of the Republic], including the Minister of Education, the President of the Academia Sinica, the President of the Peiping Research Institute, the Minister to Germany, Chen Shuren, Ye Gongchuo, Liu Haisu, Gao Qifeng, Xu Beihong, etc. In November, the 74th meeting of the Executive Yuan added Wang Yiting, Zhang Daofan, Qi Baishi, Lin Fengmian, Lin Wenzheng, Di Pingzi, Zhang Ze and seven others as preparatory committee members. On August 6th of that year, our preparatory committee held its first meeting in Shanghai and resolved to establish a preparatory office that day. The preparatory office was located in the International Exchange Office of Publications of the Academia Sinica at 331 Albert Road, Shanghai, and Cai Yuanpei, Ye Gongchuo, Chen Shuren, Xu Beihong, and Liu Haisu were elected as standing committee members, with Cai Yuanpei as chairman, and began to prepare everything. This is the process of organizing the preparatory committee.</p>
<p>Later, due to funding issues, the second general meeting was not held until January 23rd of this year [of the Republic]. It was resolved to follow the method of the National Art Exhibition hosted by the Ministry of Education in the 18th year [of the Republic], and adopt the method of soliciting works through correspondence. The scope of the works, according to the agreement between China and Germany, was limited to modern and recent paintings. More than 160 people were solicited through correspondence, all recommended by the preparatory committee members. After several months of collection and selection, more than 400 modern masterpieces and 200 famous recent works were obtained. In addition, various pigments, inks, paper, silk, satin, brushes and other painting tools from the Qianlong era of the Qing Dynasty to the present were also collected extensively, ready to be packaged and displayed along with the exhibition for German reference. A history of Chinese painting and a catalog of exhibits were also compiled and translated into German, ready to be distributed to German scholars during the exhibition. Three general meetings and six standing committee meetings have been held successively. Now that the opening date in early February next year is approaching, everything must be negotiated in Berlin first. Furthermore, the exhibition venue catalog, painting albums, the history of Chinese painting in German, and attached illustrations must also be typeset and printed in Germany. Therefore, at the recent standing committee meeting, Standing Committee Member Liu Haisu was recommended to take the first batch of exhibits on the Italian ship on November 13th to travel to Europe. In August of this year, German committee members invited the Chinese Ambassador to Germany and Counselor Liang Long, Secretary Geng Dexiang, and others to discuss the opening matters, and recommended the President of our country, the President of the Executive Yuan, the Minister of Education, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Cai Yuanpei, Li Shizeng, and Zhu Jialin as the Chinese presidents, and the German President, Prime Minister, Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Minister of Education as the German presidents. The Minister to Germany, Ye Gongchuo, and Liu Haisu were the Chinese executive committee members, and Scharf Koumer and ten others were the German executive committee members. Furthermore, the academic circles of various European countries have heard that the Chinese art exhibition has excellent collections and thorough preparations. People in those countries are eagerly looking forward to it. Provinces along the Rhine River, as well as Sweden, Austria, the Netherlands, Belgium, Italy, and other countries, have all requested the Chinese Embassy in Germany to move the exhibition to various countries and provinces after the Berlin exhibition. The embassy has agreed to do so. If funding permits, this large-scale promotion of Chinese art will not only be sufficient to promote the national spirit and express national glory, but also gain considerable international sentiment. This is the progress of the event.</p>
<p>At this point, the reporter asked about the recent reports that painters such as Wang Qi requested the Ministry of Education to order Liu Haisu to postpone his trip to Germany and to re-deliberate and revise the open solicitation and review methods. The respondent replied in detail as follows:</p>
<p>Recently, Wang Qi, Li Yishi, Gao Xishun, Zhang Yiran, Jia Yanyuan, Yang Tianhua, Tang Fangcong, Xu Dehua, Li Daocheng, Sun Qingyang, Li Xiang, Liang Dingming, Xu Shiqi, and other gentlemen jointly submitted a request to the Ministry to ask Liu Haisu to postpone his trip to Germany and to revise the open solicitation and review methods, listing three reasons: First, the current works were not openly solicited for exhibition and can only be regarded as a personal action, not representing the whole country. Second, it has been heard that various antiques collected this time contain forgeries, which may damage the honor of the country. Third, this exhibition is hosted by the Ministry of Education and is a cultural promotion of the entire country to the outside world. In ancient times, the Palace Museum should be used, and today, artists from all over the country and domestic collectors should be widely solicited. The Ministry believed that Wang and others are well-known painters in modern China, and their opinions cannot be completely ignored. The Ministry forwarded Wang's original intention to Mr. Cai Jiemin, the chairman of the preparatory committee, asking him to consider it with Mr. Ye Yufu and others. Later, the Ministry received letters from Mr. Cai and Mr. Ye, detailing the process and solemnly stating that all matters of preparation and all methods were decided by the preparatory meeting, and no one person made the decision alone. The exhibition does not accept Western paintings or Oriental paintings, but only Chinese paintings. Among Chinese paintings, it is limited to modern and recent works, and does not include ancient paintings. The talk of forgeries need not be deeply considered. As for the items solicited this time, it cannot be said that there are no omissions. In order to avoid omissions, it is still possible to make special accommodations and continue to collect after the deadline for collecting exhibits. If a certain author can be asked to submit their work, if it is specially introduced to the standing committee of the association, it can be specially supplemented and sent to Berlin. However, the meeting period is very urgent, and there must be two conditions: one is that it must be Chinese painting, and the other is that it must be delivered by the end of November this year at the latest. As for re-opening the solicitation and review, it is impossible due to time constraints. After receiving the letter, the Ministry has conveyed this intention to Wang and others.</p>
<p>The reporter learned from another source that the first batch of exhibits from our country included three pieces by Qi Baishi, three pieces by Wang Shizi, two pieces by Wang Xianzhao, two pieces by Xu Zhengbai, two pieces by Liang Kaishi, three pieces by Fu Tienian, one piece by Wang Dongpei, one piece by Qin Zhongwen, three pieces by Wu Fuzhi, one piece by Cheng Cheng, three pieces by Xu Zonghao, two pieces by Pan Tianshou, three pieces by Huang Su'an, three pieces by Zhu Wenyun, two pieces by Tang Dingzhi, two pieces by Wang Aishi, two pieces by Di Pingzi, three pieces by Xiao Qianzhong, one piece by Xu Zheng, two pieces by Zheng Wuchang, three pieces by Xie Gongzhan, two pieces by Huang Shamei, two pieces by Huang Bore, one piece by Deng Erya, two pieces by Li Gonghuo, one piece by Qi Liangkun, three pieces by Wu Wenzhi, two pieces by Kuang Youhan, three pieces by Qin Qingceng, three pieces by Lu Yifei, two pieces by Zhang Kaiji, one piece by Xie Yue, three pieces by Xie Yucen, three pieces by Xia Jingguan, one piece by Xu Zhenli, three pieces by Huang Xiaoshu, one piece by Kang Baifu, three pieces by Zhang Shuqi, three pieces by Pu Ru, one piece by Fang Ruo, three pieces by He Tianjian, two pieces by Ding Yunxuan, two pieces by Zhao Ziyun, two pieces by Hu Tingyi, two pieces by Zhu Jianqiu, one piece by Zhu Le'an, one piece by Miao Guying, three pieces by Zhang Ze, three pieces by Zhang Daqian, three pieces by Zhang Xuming, three pieces by Yao Mocun, one piece by Chen Sixuan, one piece by Yan Ganyuan, two pieces by Wu Qinmu, three pieces by Zhang Hongwei, three pieces by Zheng Manqing, one piece by Yan Jiyuan, two pieces by Yang Pu, two pieces by Guan Yide, two pieces by Xiang Yong, three pieces by Gao Jianwen, three pieces by Wang Shengyuan, two pieces by Shen Zicheng, one piece by Wang Liangsheng, one piece by Lu Zishu, two pieces by Li Fengting, one piece by Zhang Guchu, one piece by Qi Jingxi, three pieces by Yu Shaosong, two pieces by Wang Zhongshan, one piece by Feng Chaoran, one piece by Zhu Liwo, two pieces by Zhou Lengwu, two pieces by Yao Yuqin, three pieces by Chen Shuren, two pieces by Li Zuhan, two pieces by Li Qiujun, one piece by Chen Zengshou, one piece by Shang Shenbo, one piece by Yu Xueyang, one piece by Yang Xuejiu, six pieces by Huang Baohong, two pieces by Sun Menglu, three pieces by Wang Shensheng, one piece by Chen Ziqing, two pieces by Wang Qizhi, three pieces by Zhang Tianqi, three pieces by Deng Baiye, three pieces by Chen Shaolu, two pieces by Zhang Yuguang, two pieces by Zhao Anzhi, two pieces by Wang Yiting, three pieces by Tang Jianyou, two pieces by Xu Xiongcai, one piece by Su Wolong, two pieces by Fang Rending, two pieces by Deng Chunshu, one piece by Zhao Shuru, one piece by Rong Dakui, one piece by Liu Meijiang, one piece by Li Gemin, two pieces by Sun Luqing, two pieces by Gu Shusen, three pieces by Gao Qifeng, three pieces by Zhang Kunyi, three pieces by Zhou Yifeng, three pieces by He Qiyuan, three pieces by Ye Shaobing, three pieces by Zhao Shao'ang, one piece by Huang Shaoqiang, one piece by Rong Shushi, two pieces by Wang Taomin, two pieces by Tang Jisheng, one piece by Jing Yiyuan Fei Longding, one piece by Yu Jingzhi, and many more pieces that have not yet been entered.</p>

<h3>Educational Circles Hold Educational Lectures; First Lecture Held Yesterday by Dr. Wei Ke and Others</h3>
<p>The educational circles in this city have lacked contact. Now, Wei Ke, Chen Xuan'shan, Zheng Tonghe, Ma Chonggan, Zhou Shang, Ma Gongyu, Xu Zexiang, Xu Wancheng, Huang Shengbai, and more than 30 others have initiated educational lectures, which are held every week. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 pm, the first meeting was held at Guanshengyuan on Nanjing Road.

First, initiator Xu Wancheng delivered a speech. Then, former Director of the Municipal Education Bureau Dr. Wei Ke gave a speech, stating that those who run education now tend to only care about themselves. For example, when schools have financial difficulties, they increase tuition fees, but they rarely consider how students are in school and what happens after they leave school. The fault lies with those who run education. In the future, education based on children should be implemented. Later, Fang Chongzhi, who has taught in the Public School for Chinese Children of the Public Works Department for many years, reported on the general situation of the Public Works Department's primary schools. He went on to say that if China wants to survive in the world, it should start with education, cultivate children's competitive spirit, and eliminate the concept of concession and corruption. It is heard that it will still be held at Guanshengyuan next Saturday, and Pan Gongzhan, Hu Shuyi, Liu Suijiu, and other gentlemen will be invited to give speeches.</p>

<h3>Making Trouble</h3>
<p>— 19</p>
<p>Making trouble is something that everyone, from adults to children, will do at some point. However, the nature of the trouble, the intentions behind it, whether it is intentional or unintentional, all vary. Although the phrase "making trouble" doesn't seem to have been seen in the classics, considering that "the little Dong man made a tremendous disaster," which frightened old Xue Bao so much that he "knelt down to Third Mistress on both knees," it is clear that trouble should not be made. The reason why the little Dong man dared to make trouble, dared to make big trouble, dared to make tremendous disaster, is that he had a background. This background is very obvious. If old Xue Bao didn't treat his little Dong man like a treasure, how would he, the little Dong man, have had the courage to make things difficult for Third Mistress? Therefore, according to the principle of "Spring and Autumn blames the wise," it is not necessary to delve into whether the little Dong man made trouble intentionally or unintentionally; but old Xue Bao cannot escape the blame. To this day, a group of friends who are good at making trouble embrace the "do it once, do it all" principle, simply making the trouble bigger, hoping that there will always be someone like old Xue Bao to step forward and clean up the mess. This is probably imitating the little Dong man. What's pitiful is that the 'Third Mistress,' the natural order, can no longer be restored.</p>
<p>Looking at the Journey to the West, Pigsy is good at making trouble, and so is Monkey. However, Monkey's way of making trouble is much more sophisticated than Pigsy's; and his troublemaking is always ambitious. He dared to make a great disturbance in the Heavenly Palace, almost leaving the Jade Emperor helpless. This trouble was really something! Secondly, he dared to defecate in the palm of the Buddha's hand. Wasn't this trouble big enough? But what was the result? Naturally, those who have read the Journey to the West can look at each other and smile, understanding each other without needing to say much, so I don't need to elaborate. Tang Monk was fortunate to have the golden hoop curse; otherwise, he might have ended up like Third Mistress, having to pretend to be crazy. I envy Tang Monk, I pity Third Mistress.</p>
<h3>Blue Shirt</h3>
<p>Z&gt;Zhirongyu</p>
<p>As we walk on the street, we always see some people wearing blue cloth short shirts and trousers, with closely spaced buttons, openly unbuttoned at the chest. We know at a glance that this is not a working-class laborer; it must be at least a petty rascal. Because gentlemen and shop clerks, no matter how poor they are, even if they don't have rice for dinner, they would never give up a long gown or a Russian suit. So these blue cloth short shirts and trousers are a special uniform for these two types of people. There is a good reason for workers to wear these blue cloth short shirts and trousers. Because they work all day long, covered in sweat and dust, how can they wear light-colored clothes? This blue cloth is both sturdy and durable, and the dark color is resistant to dirt, so it couldn't be more suitable. As for why rascals like to wear blue cloth shirts and trousers, I haven't studied it, perhaps it's because they are cheap and durable.</p>
<p>A friend told me that the heroes of the Jianghu in the North all like to wear blue cloth shirts and trousers. Because when the green gauze tent rises, it is the perfect opportunity for them to show off their skills. Blue clothes, hidden in the lush green foliage, are hard for anyone to find. So when fighting against government troops, it can reduce the enemy's target and often gain the upper hand. Ah! I understand now - there is a kind of Blue Shirt Gang in Shanghai recently, specializing in robbery - colloquially called "skinning pigs" - local newspapers have reported on them a few days ago, it turns out they are learning from the northern heroes. However, Shanghai is like a bare mountain, with no grass on the road. If they lose in battle, they have nowhere to hide from the encircling police, which will inevitably let down the blue shirt they are wearing.</p>
<p>Speaking of blue shirts, I remember that scholars in the past all wore blue shirts. Only after passing the imperial examination and being appointed to an official position in the Golden Palace could they wear red robes. Therefore, there used to be the saying "take off the blue shirt and put on the red robe" to congratulate scholars. However, while this congratulatory phrase can still be used now, the meaning is quite different. Here are a few examples:</p>
<p>An old gentleman traveled to the border between Hunan and Jiangxi and returned. People asked him about the social situation. He only said one sentence: "Take off the blue shirt and put on the red robe." At first, people didn't understand, but later when the Red bandits rose up, they realized that he was saying that all the farmers and workers had become communists.</p>
<p>Little Sanzi, who was an apprentice in the machine shop, couldn't stand the hardship and quit his job to become a street cleaner. He wears a red cloth vest every day, sweeping garbage on the street. I said, "This is also 'taking off the blue shirt and putting on the red robe'!"</p>
<p>Finally, I would also like to advise the proletariat to make a blue cloth gown to wear. Because you can't afford Western-style suits made of national wool, and you can't afford robes made of silk and satin, it's better to wear cloth clothes. Firstly, it supports national products; secondly, it is thrifty and admirable. With these good names, you can actually save money. However, you must not save too much and switch to wearing blue cloth short shirts and trousers, because people will definitely suspect that you are down on your luck. In the current situation, you can't avoid "judging people by their clothes."</p>
<p>Sweet, Sour, Bitter, Spicy</p>
<h3>The Way of Husband and Wife</h3>
<p>— Shen Shou Ruo</p>
<p>People often say that the way of husband and wife is bitter! I, however, believe that this way is not only bitter, but also has sweet, sour, and spicy flavors. I will list them below, and I hope that comrades who are qualified to be husbands and wives will savor them.</p>
<p>(1) During the honeymoon after the wedding, they are inseparable, whispering sweet words, and the embrace of the gentle village is wonderful. The way of husband and wife is sweet!</p>
<p>(2) Love gradually fades with time, and the husband or wife may find new love. The bedroom is quiet, and jealousy arises; the waves of the sea of ​​jealousy begin from then on. The way of husband and wife is sour!</p>
<p>(3) Cracks develop from jealousy, and from cracks, a declaration of divorce; either hiring lawyers to testify, or suing in court for a public decision; both spiritually and economically, they suffer sacrifices. The way of husband and wife is bitter!</p>
<p>(4) Without jealousy, without divorce, but the family is small, and the children are particularly numerous. They not only feel the difficulty of raising them, but also suffer from the inability to stop having children. All they can do is glare with anger and huff and puff. The way of husband and wife is spicy!</p>

<h3>Four Northeastern Company Commanders</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 18: Silently Offering Tea, Conveying Sorrow, Comforting Her Husband Before the Wedding; Hastily Leaving the Frontier, Forcing a Smile to Bid Farewell to Her Family</p>
<p>Gui Zhi thought he was reluctant to break the things, so she immediately rushed forward, grabbed the teacup, and placed it on the coffee table, smiling: "It's not worth it even if you break a teacup. Why are you so reluctant to let go?" Zhao Ziqiang then stood still and said: "We soldiers consider it an honor to be wounded in battle. Holding a gun in our hands is still working. If I spill a little hot tea on the back of my hand and drop the cup, it would make me seem too useless." Gui Zhi stood in front of the coffee table, bent down and looked at his hand, smiling: "It's okay, it's not too badly burned." After she finished looking, she straightened up and took a step back. Unexpectedly, this step back bumped into the coffee table. The coffee table turned around twice, but did not stand firmly. The teacup did not stick to the surface of the coffee table, fell to the ground, and shattered with a clatter. Gui Zhi turned around and smiled: "Look, you wanted to keep it, but you still couldn't keep it, and your hand was burned for nothing." After saying this, she didn't care much, and still bent down to pick up the pieces. Zhao Ziqiang's face turned red and white, and his heart was pounding. By the time Gui Zhi picked up the broken pieces and threw them outside the door, her face was still calm as usual. Zhao Ziqiang himself then calmed down and smiled at her: "Everything is destined. This teacup was destined to be broken. See, it was still broken after all." Gui Zhi smiled: "So, my destiny is to be a soldier..." When she said this, her voice was very soft, and then she continued smiling: "In the end, it's just a soldier." Zhao Ziqiang felt that although it was a joke, it struck right at his heart. His face was flushed red, and the diagonal lines on both sides of his nose were deeply etched, showing a bitter smile that came from his embarrassment. Gui Zhi was confused. Why was her fiancé so anxious when she broke the bowl? She thought that Zhao Ziqiang was a straightforward person, and someone with new ideas, so he would not consider breaking a teacup as an ominous sign. (232)</p>

<h3>Food Knowledge: The Digestion Time of Food</h3>
<p>— Chu Yu</p>
<p>Housewives should have a basic understanding of which foods are easy to digest and which are not. Now, I will briefly explain the main components absorbed by the human body as follows. First, for foods with protein as the main component, what is the digestion time in the stomach for a serving of 1.000 grams? For a half-cooked egg (whisk the egg, mix with boiling water, or soak the whole egg in boiling water until half-cooked), it takes 1 hour and 30 minutes; raw eggs take 2 hours and 30 minutes; stewed beef takes 3 hours and 10 minutes; the so-called steak in Western cuisine takes 4 hours and 15 minutes; fried eggs take 3 hours and 15 minutes; pork (red stew takes 4 hours and 30 minutes, stir-fried tender pork slices take 4 hours and 15 minutes); steamed fish takes 3 hours and 30 minutes; fried fish takes 3 hours and 50 minutes. Comparing poultry, meat, and fish, fish digests the fastest, poultry is next, and meat is the slowest. As for foods with carbohydrates as the main component, wheat takes 1 hour and 40 minutes; rice takes 2 hours and 15 minutes; cakes take 2 and a half hours; millet and corn take 2 and a half hours; bread takes 2 hours and 10 minutes; pancakes take 3 hours; and steamed sweet potatoes take 3 hours.</p>
<h3>Essential Elements of Food and the Body</h3>
<p>Autumn and winter are the seasons when appetite is strongest throughout the year. If properly nourished, the body easily becomes obese, so special attention should be paid to daily food. The most important foods are: (1) Foods that build muscles (protein), which means obtaining foods that are rich in nitrogen (such as fish, beans, tofu, peanuts, tofu skin, etc.); (2) Foods that warm the body, which means eating more foods containing starch (such as rice, potatoes, wheat, bread, biscuits, cakes, etc.); (3) If you want a healthy and developed brain and nerves, you need to eat things that contain phosphorus (such as fish, shrimp, rabbit meat, etc.); (4) If you want to increase vitality, you can eat seaweed and seafood (if you lack vitality, the thyroid gland in the body will enlarge and cause disease); (5) To nourish bones, you should eat milk, eggs, and the roots and stems of green vegetables (if bones lack nutrients, tuberculosis will occur). Other vitamins are essential for body development. Foods richest in vitamin A are milk, cod liver oil, beef, fish, human milk, potatoes, eggs, millet, and vegetables. Foods richest in vitamin B are brown rice, wheat, eggs, sugar, milk, and green vegetables. Foods richest in vitamin C are lemons, oranges, apples, and vegetables. The nutrients we get daily, maintaining life, protecting health, and promoting development, all rely on the power of the various elements mentioned above. Simply put, carbohydrates are the source of vitality. For example, we spend a lot of vitality throughout the day and should eat some plant-based foods, which means getting more starch, cellulose, and other things. Protein replenishes the substances consumed in the body and forms the body's tissues. Part of the fat generates vitality, and part is stored in the subcutaneous tissue and other parts of the body, replenishing consumed substances and forming body tissues. Inorganic salts supplement inorganic substances in the body and regulate life functions. The supply of water is also very important. Digestive problems often occur due to a lack of water in the body, such as a dry tongue and signs of nervous excitement. Moreover, water accounts for about two-thirds of our body, and water in the body is like oil in a machine. Therefore, our daily food should take into account various nutrients, so that the body will not weaken. If we focus on one type of nutrient, we will develop a deficiency. Therefore, women in charge of household affairs should pay special attention to food. Foreigners often say that we Chinese people have no common sense and do not know hygiene, which refers to not knowing whether the things we eat every day are beneficial or harmful.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Medical and Pharmaceutical Overview in the Last Decade (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Pang Jingzhou</p>
<p>Medical and pharmaceutical publications. In a nutshell, they are "especially numerous in Shanghai, but lack uniformity." The reason is the lack of communication among authors and the fact that the responsibility for publishing rests entirely with the medical and pharmaceutical community itself. To solve this problem, there are only two paths. The first is a grand unification of medical societies, with the society taking on the responsibility of publishing and promotion. Then, widely recruit writers among the members and distribute them geographically. This would not only solve the problem in Shanghai but perhaps also bring harmony to the whole country. The second method is to completely relinquish the right of publication to the publishing industry—booksellers. (According to foreign practice, there are many such cases.) This would give the publishing sector greater economic strength and allow it to develop expertise in attracting advertising and promoting magazines. Furthermore, manuscripts would be paid for directly, and editing staff would be hired at high salaries. This would certainly yield great results, and this method is easier to implement than waiting for a grand unification of medical societies. It is just that the current publishing industry has not yet turned its attention to medical and pharmaceutical magazines. According to my calculations, even looking at the thirty-odd publications on the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways, the total amount of advertising revenue is not small. The total number of copies sold is also somewhat considerable. Moreover, after a merger, the abundance of manuscripts would allow the magazine to be converted into a weekly, thereby increasing advertising rates. Therefore, this is indeed a worthwhile business for the publishing industry to undertake.</p>
<p>The initial motivation for writing this article was to roughly describe the chaotic and uneven situation in Shanghai's medical and pharmaceutical community, in order to attract the attention of the public and encourage them to supervise and improve it. I did not expect that as I wrote, I would say more and more unnecessary things. Not saying them would make the situation unclear. Eventually, I became distracted and touched on many issues. I am afraid that readers will find it tedious, so I must quickly conclude. As for the methods I have described, they are merely a humble opinion, and may not be entirely appropriate. Moreover, the economic imbalance in the medical and pharmaceutical community is not unique to China. Even in a country like the United States, they are grappling with the issue of "the wealthy spending too much" and "38% of the poor not receiving adequate treatment." Therefore, they have a committee studying the distribution of medical and pharmaceutical resources across the United States, which has been working for five years. Although Shanghai is only one city, it is impossible to come up with a perfect solution in just a few words or half a day. If we can get socially conscious individuals to dedicate some of their brainpower to this issue and work together for the happiness of all the citizens of the city, that is what the author will pray for sincerely.</p>
<p>This conversational piece is based on what I have heard, seen, and remembered, so I have not used any references. However, I have received much help regarding doctors, hospitals, and medical administration from the files of the Bureau of Health, the Medical Affairs Compilation, and the Medical Guide. Similar arguments to mine and works that can be compared to this article have also been published during the period when this article was being successively disclosed. Now, I will extract the original titles, authors, and sources, and append them below as twenty-four references.</p>

<h3>Promoting Public Health and Improving the Lives of the Poor</h3>
<p>— Song Guobin</p>
<p>Articles on how to promote public health seem to be very popular in China right now, but while the talk is exciting, the actual results are minimal. If we want to promote public health, we should eliminate the phenomena that hinder health. If we want to prevent infection, we should eradicate the sources of infectious diseases. Prescribing medicine randomly without knowing the cause will not only fail to cure the disease but may also create new problems. Treating the head when it hurts and the foot when it hurts may provide temporary relief, but the problem will eventually recur. Friends who advocate for public health must grasp the concept of "prescribing medicine according to the symptoms."</p>
<p>I believe that if we want to promote public health and eradicate the spread of infectious diseases, the most important fundamental solution is to improve the lives of the poor! If you don't believe me, we can look at the facts. In the past decade, the dissemination of health knowledge in China seems to have achieved considerable results. There are quite a few people who know how to pay attention to hygiene, and unhygienic behaviors are not as prevalent or severe as they used to be. Health construction in various places—except for some remote provinces and inaccessible inland areas—seems to be progressing in several major cities. However, epidemics still rage as usual. What is the reason for this? The reason is simple: those who know about hygiene are only the middle and upper classes, and those who can afford hygiene are only the middle and upper classes. The countless poor people not only do not know about hygiene but also do not have the means to practice it. Because they cannot even afford adequate food and clothing, how can they afford hygiene? The middle and upper classes may firmly defend their hygienic walls, believing that all infectious diseases can be avoided! However, these poor people who create infectious diseases constantly spread the excess bacteria they produce. Although the thoroughfares of big cities are clean! The bacteria emanating from the slums hidden behind these roads cannot be isolated forever! Therefore, promoting public health should start with improving the lives of the poor. Although this may not be an all-encompassing solution, it can at least achieve the effect of eliminating infectious diseases.</p>
<p>Not knowing about hygiene and therefore not practicing it is simply pitifully ignorant. Knowing about hygiene but not having the means to practice it, in other words, being in an environment that does not allow one to practice hygiene, is truly terrifying! If we open our eyes and take a look, there are simply too many of our poor compatriots! They live in extremely poor, low-grade houses, wear extremely dirty clothes, eat extremely poor food, and do extremely laborious work. In short, they are in a dark world all year round, and what this darkness hides are nothing but helpless groans, innocent illnesses, and constant deaths. Thus, this vast dark area has invisibly become a breeding ground for infectious diseases! Every poor person's small house has almost become a machine for producing bacteria. They have neither the knowledge of hygiene nor the ability to practice it. Shouldn't the friends who advocate for public health pay attention to this point?</p>
<p>Our relief for this majority of the poor should be carried out simultaneously on two fronts: on the one hand, popularize health education so that they know about hygiene; on the other hand, improve the environment to improve their lives, destroy their dark, prison-like houses, and build and open the most economical and hygienic places to live and eat, in order to solve their housing and food problems. For their illnesses, we should establish free clinics to diagnose and treat them. It should be understood that infectious diseases are more likely to infect those with weak bodies. Due to poor nutrition, their resistance is also weak! Our unfortunate poor are thus given the easiest opportunity for bacteria to invade! If we pay attention to this point, make their environment better, and make their bodies stronger, the bacteria will have nowhere to settle. Isn't this a radical solution?</p>
<h3>Casual Notes After Diagnosis (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Chen Fangzhi</p>
<p>Having a center of gravity is the fundamental basis for all things to progress in a down-to-earth manner. We hear historians say that the center of gravity of England's progress lies in the national flag, and the center of gravity of Japan's progress lies in the imperial family. Because there is a center of gravity, the efforts, beliefs, vision, and hearing of the people of the whole country can all be concentrated on a target, and the actions of the center of gravity are enough to make the entire society submit and follow. This is true of politics, culture, and medicine.</p>
<p>The medical centers of gravity in various countries are mostly in universities. University professors, day and night, conduct scientific research, hold meetings to discuss, and are all knowledgeable and thoughtful. They all understand the past achievements, and establish their future research directions, all standing on the bright path of the same system. They make the people of the whole country believe that they have the ability to solve the complex phenomenon of diseases, so when there is a difficult problem, they take it to the university to solve it. Everyone is of one mind, and there is no disagreement. Let us cite a few famous examples... Napoleon suffered from abdominal pain, and the military doctor could not decide. Professor Colin of the University of Paris diagnosed it as stomach cancer. After Prime Minister Hamaguchi was stabbed, although his wound healed, he developed abdominal pain and fever, and the doctors were helpless. Professor Shiota of the University of Tokyo diagnosed</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>it as actinomycosis.</p>
<p>Later, Shiota personally went to court to testify that the aggravation of this actinomycosis was motivated by the stabbing, which turned its latent state into an active state and shortened the Prime Minister's life. Therefore, the stabber was given a heavier sentence. What the university professors said made everyone, from the president and emperor to prisoners and beggars, bow their heads and obey. This is the authority of academia, and this is the wonderful use of a center of gravity.</p>
<p>Now, does our China have a medical center of gravity? This question should be divided into two eras. Before the introduction of Western medicine, there was no center of gravity that could dominate the national belief. At that time, people's mentality of seeking a center of gravity was nothing more than two kinds: one was a fluke mentality, and the other was an archaic mentality. "One simple prescription can kill a famous doctor," and "Take advantage of my ten years of good luck, come to me quickly when you are sick." These kinds of sayings are full of evidence of the fluke mentality. Seeking fortune at the Red Temple, seeing a doctor with a stomach fairy, and the Jisheng Association using magic are all based on this mentality. As for the archaic mentality, it is dominant among the middle and upper classes.</p>
<p>The popularity of being a former imperial physician of the Taiyuan Hospital and the respect for Confucian doctors are expressions of the archaic mentality. Because Confucian doctors and imperial physicians have read more medical books than contemporary doctors, and they can understand The Yellow Emperor's Inner Canon, The Classic of Difficulties, and the Synopsis of the Golden Chamber. Of course, the Confucian doctors and imperial physicians themselves have not published accurate statistics on medical treatment, nor have they published new academic achievements. The superiors do what the inferiors do, and they are blindly superstitious.</p>
<p>After the introduction of Western medicine, some people who believed in Western medicine suddenly gained a center of gravity, which was the real blue-eyed and yellow-bearded foreign doctor. Especially in the concession area on the Shanghai Bund, there were doctors from all countries such as Britain, the United States, Germany, France, and Japan. There were also grand hospitals and inn-style hospitals. People who did not have medical knowledge could be even happier than the citizens of Berlin and Paris. They could freely choose and enjoy the grace of the new medicine of all countries at will. How carefree are the citizens who can gain without labor? You see, when the fashionable friends on the Shanghai Bund have intractable diseases, they do not rush to solve them?</p>
<p>However, listen to the officials, if ready-made blessings can really be received, which country's citizens do not have this lazy mentality? Don't panic, I will cite a few real examples and write them down faithfully to see if they are worthy of being the medical center of gravity of our country. Let us savor and think about it.</p>
<p>A Mr. Luo from Tunxi, Anhui, came to Shanghai two months ago specifically to treat his eyes. At first, he sought treatment from a certain gentleman. According to his own statement, the old-fashioned ophthalmologist in his hometown diagnosed him with internal cataracts, which Western medicine could surgically remove, so he came to Shanghai for treatment. When the gentleman saw it, he indeed had cataracts, but his pupils were irregular and there were traces of iritis. After examining his fundus, his vitreous body was also turbid, and his intraocular pressure was high, clearly showing signs of primary glaucoma. Therefore, his superficial cataracts were inflammatory, complicated, and secondary, and should not be operated on according to the rules. If he waited slowly for the inflammation to subside, he could still maintain some vision. The gentleman told him this, but he left with a half-believing attitude. A month later, he came again with tears in his eyes. He said that a certain foreign doctor in a certain large hospital had carelessly performed an operation, and although the cataracts were removed, his eyes were blind, and even the little vision he had was gone. Was there any way to save it? Of course, there was no way to save it. This is one of the achievements of foreign doctors.</p>
<p>A Mr. Jiang from the same village had a fever for thirteen or fourteen days. After seeing a doctor and taking medicine, the fever subsided, but after the fever subsided, he developed abdominal distension and pain, and could not pass bowel movements (even enemas were ineffective). A certain doctor invited a certain foreign doctor to consult, who said that it was acute appendicitis and that a laparotomy should be performed immediately, otherwise his life would be uncertain.

<h3>The Crux of Physical Education in Our Country Today</h3>
<p>— Guo Renji</p>
<p>Education is the parallel pursuit of physical education and intellectual education. In addition to intellectual education, schools also teach gymnastics, with the aim of enabling the development of children and the physical strength of young people to develop according to rules. However, as the types of sports become more and more diverse, there are competitions and outdoor sports, which must be practiced.</p>
<p>So-called sports, if carried out according to the rules, can certainly be expected to develop fully. However, there are several kinds of sports that are of little interest unless they are carried out through competition. However, once in a competition, the outcome of both sides must be decided, and it is more interesting to arouse competition.</p>
<p>As competition between schools begins, schools aim to cultivate excellent athletes in order to win. Due to the tendency to focus on competition, it leads to the disadvantage of neglecting physical education. Therefore, although the country is chanting the revitalization of physical education every day, in reality it is only revitalizing competition. This is also unavoidable. To remedy this, it is advisable for doctors to rise up to study the harms caused by sports and do their best to eliminate or reduce them.</p>
<p>Schools do have so-called school doctors. However, the school authorities do not trust them, and even entrust them to old doctors. As for the school doctors, they only go to the clinic when there is illness, or carry out physical examinations. There are almost no people who study the impact of sports on school education. Therefore, in order to develop physical education, both the school authorities and the school doctors must thoroughly change their concepts.</p>
<p>Then how should physical education be carried out in schools? Before gymnastics and swimming, it is necessary for school doctors to distinguish the students' physical fitness. Generally speaking, children with weak bodies need excellent teachers and wise parents to order them to stop doing gymnastics. Either stop completely, or do a physical examination first to determine what kind of gymnastics they are suitable for. It is true that some children with weak bodies gradually strengthen their bodies through appropriate gymnastics, and eventually they can also participate in competitions. Therefore, being physically weak alone cannot be a reason to stop doing gymnastics. (See my book The Scientific Basis of Physical Education. Sold by the author's publishing house.)</p>

<h3>The "Ronin" of Japan</h3>
<p>— Shi Heng</p>
<p>According to a report in the newspaper, Reuters telegraphed from Changchun on the 30th of this month that the local Japanese consulate, police, and military police authorities are preparing to expel Japanese ronin in Manchuria based on their names. It is said that anyone who meets the following five qualifications can be called a ronin: 1. Those who organize secret societies and engage in political conspiracies to incite disputes; 2. Those who use the names of Japanese and Manchurian officials to seek illegitimate privileges and benefits; 3. Those who extort money through fraudulent behavior; 4. Those whose behavior tarnishes the reputation of the Japanese nation; 5. Those whose actions hinder the development of "Manchukuo." Overall, these five points serve as a warning to the Japanese ronin in Manchuria, urging them to be more disciplined. Because they are now "hindering the development of 'Manchukuo'," "tarnishing the reputation of the Japanese nation," and even engaging in "political conspiracies to incite disputes."</p>
<p>The term "ronin" in Japan can be said to be a historical term, and its meaning is similar to that of hooligans. They are some unemployed, reckless, and penniless individuals. In the well-ordered society of the Japanese Empire, these people should undoubtedly be beheaded. However, these ronin are of great use to the Japanese Empire, and in fact, they have made contributions in the past. They have become the vanguard of Japanese imperialism's aggression. This is the smartest approach of the Japanese government, which can be said to be utilizing waste. Keeping them in the country would only disrupt social order and make good citizens uneasy, but if they are sent to the places of oppressed and weak nations within the reach of Japanese imperialism's power, they can do things that iron cavalry or secret agents cannot do. Moreover, once they are discovered or killed, it can actually eliminate harm for the empire and also serve as a diplomatic excuse. Therefore, wherever Japanese people go in China, there are always many so-called ronin. Not to mention in various parts of "Manchukuo," ronin are also quite active in major Chinese commercial ports such as Shanghai, Tianjin, and Jinan. They sell red pills and morphine, transport guns and ammunition, collude with hooligan organizations and plainclothes teams to disrupt Chinese cities, and commit all kinds of evils. However, we have never heard of the Japanese Empire issuing any strict prohibitions or expulsion orders. On the contrary, they are protected by special laws, and once they encounter an accident, their value is high enough to be worth hundreds or thousands of Chinese lives.</p>
<p>But why is there now an order to expel ronin issued in Manchukuo?</p>
<p>Of course, first, "Manchukuo" is now its own family, and it should begin to maintain social peace; second, the newly opened business should bestow some imperial grace on the suffering and struggling young fellows, and it should also maintain the empire's international reputation to the outside world - these are enough reasons to expel the ronin. Moreover, the order is for people to see, and no one really knows what it will actually be like.</p>
<p>But even if there is such a thing in reality, don't sympathize with the ronin, thinking that the great Japanese Empire is an ungrateful fellow. Don't you see that many of the former ronin have now become officials in the new country? If someone was a ronin before and is still a ronin now, it clearly indicates that there is not enough porridge for the monks and it is difficult to accommodate them. Although expulsion does not sound good in name, it is actually finding a way out for them. Which fool would believe that these ronin would be shipped back to the interior of the empire?</p>
<p>Then where will these ronin be expelled to? Moreover, the Japanese country is constantly producing new ronin under the current global economic panic. The old ronin have become members of the ruling class, and new ronin are coming again. Where is their destination for accommodation?</p>
<p>We Chinese should think about this question!</p>
<h3>Demon Cave</h3>
<p>— Qing Nong</p>
<p>At night, wandering in the mysterious street.</p>
<p>Autumn rain patters and falls, and the streetlights are like tearful giants. To avoid the rain, I ducked into the porch of Isis, staring blankly at the speeding cars, trams, and rickshaws.</p>
<p>If the rain doesn't stop, how can I get home tonight? The road is so far.</p>
<p>Across the street, the neon sign of Xinya dazzles the eyes, and the police officer at the intersection of Qiu Jiang Road waves his baton, shouting at the rickshaw pullers. Several young people in raincoats walked past me, blowing whistles. The autumn rain still pattered and fell.</p>
<p>Now that I've found a friend, I shouldn't be afraid to speak up out of embarrassment.</p>
<p>I felt a bit of regret, staring at the tearful, twinkling streetlight!</p>
<p>"Hello!" Who is standing in front of me, greeting me? Looking closely, it was the friend I had just parted with.</p>
<p>"Not home yet? Let's go, let's go. It's very boring tonight, let's go dancing."</p>
<p>With a bit of pulling and persuasion, I was already inside the "Moon Palace Dance Hall" in a few steps. Going upstairs, a waiter came over to take your hat and autumn coat. I've already entered the entrance of the demon cave, let's see what the demon cave is like this year?</p>
<p>It was deserted, only seeing groups of snake-like demon women. The guests were like stars struggling in a cloudy night, the lights changed color, and the music was harsh. It turned out that the musicians were no longer the black-faced Filipinos.</p>
<p>In the melody of the music, my feet were itching strangely, wanting to dance, but...</p>
<p>The lights came on, the music stopped, and my friend came back, saying...</p>
<p>"What? Don't have a familiar dance partner?"</p>
<p>"No, recently, I don't want to dance."</p>
<p>"Is that so? (gesturing) Didn't bring one? I'll treat you."</p>
<p>In the melody of the music, I forgot everything, dancing and dancing.</p>
<p>The demon woman's eyebrows were tightly locked, and a light cloud of sorrow enveloped the lake of her eyes and the ridge of her nose.</p>
<p>"Business is not good here!" I said to myself, half asking her.</p>
<p>"What is here?"</p>
<p>"Business is not very good, right?"</p>
<p>"Hmm, business is not good."</p>
<p>"Then why don't you go somewhere else?"</p>
<p>"Isn't it the same elsewhere?"</p>
<p>"Then, why don't you change professions?"</p>
<p>"I couldn't find anything else to do, that's why I came here, how can you say change professions?"</p>
<p>[.......] I could only remain silent.</p>
<p>[What company are you in?]</p>
<p>[Uh, uh,.......] I found it even harder to answer her!</p>
<p>Saying that I entered the demon cave to find stimulation, her words were precisely the stimulation that made my heart beat restlessly. People were looking for the stimulation of joy and anaesthesia, but this time that stimulation was like a sharp blade piercing into my heart, painful and bitter!</p>
<p>The rain stopped outside the window. Using a headache as an excuse, I immediately escaped from that demon cave, the music still echoed in my ears, and the demon woman's lightly sorrowful face was still stuck on my mind.</p>
<p>However, in my heart, a thought suddenly flashed...</p>
<p>Why not use the money spent in the demon cave to pay the rent and food bills that are being催 (cuī: push, urge) me to death.</p>
<h3>Talking About [Misspelled Words] Again</h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>To Mr. Gao Zhi and Mr. Gao Ming</p>
<p>This is certainly not a dispute of emotions.</p>
<p>The few times I have spoken up for misspelled words, it was not to say that writing misspelled words can become a misspelled word movement, and everyone should promote it. (Mr. Gao Zhi misunderstood that I support writing misspelled words in a [each governs their own] style. Mr. Gao Ming even wants to use only misspelled words to write an article to test me. Didn't I say that language and writing are society's common currency? Writing misspelled words in a [each governs their own] style, isn't that disrupting the [financial market]? Even the most foolish would not go that far.) It's just saying that the reason why young people write and read misspelled words is fundamentally due to the difficulty in recognizing and writing square characters. We should follow the trend and make fundamental reforms. Why should we follow the trend? Because the past borrowed and interchangeable characters, the number of which is surprisingly large, with more than three thousand, the misspelled words written by these old ancestors of misspelled words are deeply sinful. They do not die out on their own, forcing us to write and read misspelled words. We can't afford this full debt, so we have to open the abacus and summarize it, so there are suggestions for simplified characters and new phonetic-semantic characters. (Mr. Gao Ming agrees with the attitude of [using what is already established and prohibiting what is not yet established]. This is impossible, because it cannot be told to everyone. For example, [Qingyang Port] was originally [Xinyang Port], [Zhenru] was originally [Zhenru]. It is impossible to prohibit, and it is impossible to use. Mr. Zhang Taiyan discussed interchangeable and borrowed characters, saying that there are already many misspelled words from predecessors, and we don't need to write misspelled words anymore. His meaning is similar to that of Mr. Gao, but how can we stop them from writing them?)</p>
<p>The simplified character movement has long been advocated and practiced by others (I also extremely agree with Mr. Gao Zhi's proposition.) Now I will only talk about the new phonetic-semantic characters that I advocate. Six years ago, I bought a huge Chinese-English rhyming dictionary in an old bookstore in Hangzhou (published during the Tongzhi era, written by the American William). At the beginning of the volume, there was a table of one thousand and forty base characters that made me interested. Europeans study Chinese characters and have the ambition to incorporate square characters using scientific methods. The so-called 1040 base characters mean analyzing Chinese characters and having these basic mother bodies. (This book was destroyed in the January 28th Incident. Based on my memory, the analysis is not very logical.) I think that in the evolution of Chinese characters, the increase in phonetic-semantic characters is the most. If we can change all characters into phonetic-semantic characters, then recitation and memory will be much simpler. (The inspection of Chinese characters, predecessors used sound, later generations used form. From the form, it is mainly based on radicals. In recent new character searching methods, there are as many as ninety-seven kinds, none of which are usable. Changing to phonetic-semantic characters will also solve the character searching method as a whole.) And the pronunciation of all characters is completely determined, and the number of strokes is completely reduced, then the common problem of reading and writing misspelled words can be eliminated once and for all.</p>
<p>The new phonetic-semantic characters that I envision are like this… (According to my proposal, they should be called nourishing sound characters; phonetic-semantic characters retain the old name.) All square characters are divided into five types: left form right sound, right form left sound, upper form lower sound, lower form upper sound, and outer form inner sound. Irregular ones are supplemented to make them conform to the rules. For the sound part, abandon the original text and use the national pronunciation to combine. (Detailed methods can be found in another article, "Private Discussion on New Phonetic-Semantic Characters.") For the form part, use common simplified characters and then expand them. It can be said that 70% follows the old customs, 10% expands on the old customs, and 20% is newly added; that is, it is not very difficult for us to learn ourselves. It's very ridiculous, this is reformism. Of course, [the development of language and writing, although it starts with individuals, is completed by society]. How dare I go against people's preferences with my speaking up? I am just contributing a little personal opinion, offering a brick to attract jade, and I would like to ask the gentlemen who pay attention to the reform of Chinese characters to teach me.</p>
<h3>Two Brothers (19)</h3>
<p>By Maupassant, translated by Li Weike</p>
<p>Only one gas lamp was lit above the counter, which was piled with many glass bottles. For the sake of saving money, the gas lamps in the shop were not lit at all. Behind this counter, a bald old man was stretched out with his legs, sitting in a chair. His huge beak-like nose connected to that bare forehead, giving him the mournful appearance of a parrot. At this moment, he was already fast asleep, his chin resting on his chest.</p>
<p>He woke up upon hearing the ringing of the doorbell. He stood up and, seeing that it was the doctor, stretched out both hands to greet him.</p>
<p>His black礼服(lǐfú: formal attire) which was full of stains of acids and sweet juices, was worn on his short and skinny body...it was too large and it looked like an ancient Daoist robe. When he spoke, his Polish accent was very strong, sounding somewhat childlike, and the pronunciation was muffled, similar to a toddler learning to speak.</p>
<p>笔尔(Bǐ'ěr: transliteration) sat down, and 玛洛斯科(Mǎluōskē: transliteration) asked him:</p>
<p>"Any news, dear doctor?"</p>
<p>"No. Everything is as usual."</p>
<p>"You don't look happy on your face tonight."</p>
<p>"I am not happy every day."</p>
<p>"Alright, alright, we have to get rid of all the boredom. Do you want a glass of sweet wine?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I would like to drink some."</p>
<p>"Then I will let you taste a new blend. For two months, I have been trying to make wine with raspberries. So far, this thing has only been used to make cordial...Well, I succeeded...succeeded...This is an excellent sweet wine, excellent, excellent!"</p>
<p>So, very happily, he ran to a glass cabinet, opened the cabinet, and picked out a small glass bottle. He shook the glass with short gestures. He would never complete this gesture, he would never fully extend his arms, he would never fully straddle his legs, he would never make a complete and definite action. His thoughts were the same as his actions. He indicated what he was thinking, made reservations, roughly sketched it, or hinted at it, but never explained it.</p>
<p>The thing he seemed to be most concerned with was blending some cordials and sweet wines. "As long as we can make a good cordial or good sweet wine, we can make a fortune," he often said.</p>
<p>He had invented nearly a hundred kinds of sweet ingredients, but none of them were able to be sold. 笔尔(Bǐ'ěr: transliteration) once said that 玛洛斯科(Mǎluōskē: transliteration) reminded him of 玛纳(Mǎnà: transliteration).</p>
<p>He ran to the shop counter and took two small cups from the wooden board where the drinks were mixed. Then the two of them held their glasses up to the gas lamp to examine the color of the sweet wine.</p>
<p>"Beautiful ruby!" 笔尔(Bǐ'ěr: transliteration) said.</p>
<p>"Isn't it?"</p>
<p>The old Polish head, like a parrot, looked extremely happy.</p>
<p>The doctor tasted the wine, savoring it, thinking about it carefully, then took another sip, thought about it again, and then said:</p>
<p>"Very good, very good, and the taste is very new. Dearest, this is simply an invention!"</p>
<p>"Ah! Really, I am very happy."</p>
<p>So 玛洛斯科(Mǎluōskē: transliteration) discussed with him about giving this new wine a name...He wanted to call it "Raspberry Essence," or "Superior Raspberry Essence," or "Special Raspberry," or "Number One Raspberry."</p>
<p>笔尔(Bǐ'ěr: transliteration) did not approve of any of these names.</p>

<h3>Japan's Measures for Controlling Rice</h3>
<p>— Bing Yu</p>
<p>Liu Tang's Note: Japan's rice production has increased due to improved seeds and farming methods, leading to an overabundance and the need for control, which is now being implemented. However, the general idea of the method is still the saying of "ever-normal." Our country, since Guan Zhong advocated "light and heavy" and "collection and distribution," opened the way for "equal distribution and leveling." Li Wei of the Wei Dynasty, seeing that cheap grain hurts farmers and expensive grain hurts the people, thought of a way to achieve both, and there was the system of "ever-normal granary." The "ever-normal" means buying grain when it is cheap and selling it when it is expensive, which is the same principle as Guan Zhong's "collecting with lightness and distributing with heaviness." However, the difficulty lies in buying, which requires money. Does the government have such financial resources? Even if it does, what if there are successive years of abundance? In ancient times, there was no scientific standard for the price of high and low. But as for Japan's method of controlling rice, it is also to prevent it from being too expensive or too cheap, taking into account the livelihood of farmers, and preventing the income from not compensating for the expenses; and also to prevent the general living from feeling the burden of maintaining rice prices. However, given Japan's narrow area and the scale of its production, consumption surveys, and statistics, it still feels that the price setting and purchasing are not easy, and there are still many difficulties ahead. If there is no such equipment and the land is not small, and we also speak lightly of control, I really don't know where the plan will come from, and what suffering will be in store. Here, we have collected the latest information on the implementation of rice control in Japan from Japanese books and newspapers, and Mr. Bing Yu has translated it into writing for reference. Unfortunately, due to the rush of time and the limited space, it is not possible to be comprehensive, and I hope for understanding.</p>
<h3>1. The Origin of Rice Control in Japan</h3>
<p>For more than ten years, Japan has been filling with rice seeds, improving farming, and the amount of grain produced has increased year by year. Last year, it reached a harvest that had not been seen in three years, and Korea and Taiwan have also had frequent abundant harvests, and many rice grains have been imported into Japan. Japan originally lacked rice, taking resources from Taiwan and Korea, and relying on Siam and Burma. To this end, it also suffered from excess, and the price of grain plummeted, and rice was overstocked, almost doubling compared with previous years. As the price of rice fell, farmers' income did not compensate for their expenses, and the economy was difficult, and the countryside went bankrupt, and they began to think and move, and society was uneasy. If a remedy is not sought quickly, new rice will enter the market, and prices will fall even more, which will cause the collapse of rural areas throughout the country. The Japanese government, in view of the deepening crisis, has raised the issue of controlling rice. However, what is difficult in controlling rice.</p>
<p>(1) Is the problem of importing rice from the colonies. The import of rice from Taiwan and Korea to Japan is enough to control the fate of farmers in the Japanese mainland. However, preventing the import of rice from Taiwan and Korea will inevitably cause resistance from farmers in Taiwan and Korea, and it will also lead to a sharp fall in the value of rice in Taiwan and Korea, which will inevitably have a major impact on Japan's policy of controlling colonies. Therefore, in order to maintain the livelihood of domestic farmers and adjust the surplus of colonial production, the government promulgated the Rice Control Law, and at the same time formulated specific guidelines for colonial rice control, taking into account both internal and external rice supply and demand relations to maintain balance. However, there is already a lot of rice in storage. The new rice is also strong, and the phenomenon of famine in good years is becoming more and more urgent. In order to alleviate the current crisis, the government implemented a fixed maximum and minimum price to regulate changes in rice prices. Furthermore, the area of rice cultivation in Japan accounts for 45% of the area of major crops. The area of paddy fields accounts for 55% of the total cultivated land area. Half of Japan's population is farmers, and agricultural products account for an average of between 50% and 60% of the total, which has become commodity production. Rice accounts for an average of 50% to 60%, and has also become a commodity. However, the purchasing power of rice is only half of the purchasing power of the entire agriculture, so the agricultural rice production has also become an important issue for commerce and industry, which is why the Japanese government's control of rice is so urgent.</p>
<h3>2. Production and Consumption of Japanese Rice</h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the abundant production of rice in Japan has instead created the phenomenon of famine in good years, which is an undeniable fact. According to the survey in August of this year, the amount of rice in storage reached ten million koku, and the new rice appeared, about four to five million koku, which caused a great panic in the market. According to the market price in September, each koku was only about seven or eight yuan, and this price of seven or eight yuan was not enough to compensate farmers for their production costs. According to the survey by the Japan Imperial Agricultural Association, the production cost per koku of rice is 22 yuan and 70 cents if the land capital is calculated at 30%, 24 yuan and 80 cents if calculated at 40%, and the average for the last ten years is 31 yuan, 45 cents (the land capital interest is calculated at 30%). If calculated at the original price in the producing area, it is 17 yuan; the loss per koku is more than 5 yuan, plus all other expenses; it should be at 25 yuan. However, the current price of rice is only 21-22 yuan, so the farmers' losses are very large, so it is urgently necessary to increase the price of rice to compensate the farmers' losses. Moreover, the reason for this is actually because production has increased and consumption has decreased. The following is a breakdown of the production volume of the Japanese mainland, Korea, and Taiwan over the past ten years (area unit: 1,000 chōbu, harvest unit: 1,000 koku)</p>
<p>Japanese Mainland Korea Taiwan</p>
<p>(i.e. 1922) Cultivated Area Harvested Volume Cultivated Area Harvested Volume Cultivated Area Harvested Volume</p>
<p>1922 3,140 60,693 1,557 15,014 529 5,445</p>
<p>1923 3,147 56,444 1,550 15,174 522 4,865</p>
<p>1924 3,142 57,170 1,575 13,219 547 6,076</p>
<p>1925 3,153 59,703 1,587 14,773 567 6,443</p>
<p>1926 3,158 55,592 1,587 15,300 584 6,214</p>
<p>1927 3,173 62,102 1,602 17,298 603 6,898</p>
<p>1928 3,192 60,303 1,57 13,511 605 6,795</p>
<p>1929 3,210 59,668 1,632 19,180 633 7,370</p>
<p>1930 3,239 66,875 1,662 19,180 633 7,370</p>
<p>1931 3,248 55,215 1,674 15,872 653 7,479</p>
<p>1932 3,257 60,390 1,643 16,345 684 8,949</p>
<p>Looking at the above table, the cultivated area and the amount of harvest are increasing year by year, which is the result of Japan's gradual improvement in agricultural management. However, the consumption has decreased. That is, in 1926 (1926), the annual consumption per person was 1 koku, 1 to, 3 sho, and 2 go, 1 koku, 9 sho, and 8 go in 1928, 1 koku, 1 to, and 2 go in 1930, 1 koku and 7 sho and 2 go in 1931, and 1 koku and 8 go in 1932, which is a decrease of 1 to and 2 sho and 4 go compared to 1926. Production and consumption are going in opposite directions, so the fundamental solution to the rice price problem is extremely difficult. What is even more serious is that the import of rice from Taiwan and Korea to the Japanese mainland has increased year by year. From 1922 to 1932, the import volume is as follows (unit: 1,000 koku)</p>
<p>Year Korean Rice Taiwan Rice</p>
<p>1922 3,136 740</p>
<p>1923 3,453 1,131</p>
<p>1924 4,547 1,658</p>
<p>1925 4,428 2,522</p>
<p>1926 5,213 2,186</p>

<p>1932 7,197 3,420</p>
<p>(Note) The production of rice in the Japanese mainland has increased year by year, and the import of rice from Taiwan and Korea has also become more and more prosperous, so the price of rice in the mainland has to fall.</p>
<h3>3. Rice Production Costs in Japan</h3>
<p>The Imperial Agricultural Association of Japan, in order to plan for national control and determine standard rice prices, dispatched Okada On to investigate rice production costs. All items such as seeds, fertilizers, various materials, labor, animal power, farming equipment costs, farm building costs, public taxes, and land capital interest were included in the investigation. Regarding fertilizer expenses, according to their survey, the costs for self-supplied fertilizers were as follows:</p>
<p>Fertilizer Type | From Taisho 11 to Showa 4 | Showa 5 | Showa 6 | Showa 7</p>
<p>---|---|---|---|---</p>
<p>Yuan | Yuan | Yuan | Yuan</p>
<p>Ordinary compost | 5.31 | 2.10 | 1.55 | 1.38</p>
<p>Chinese Milk Vetch | 3.67 | 1.32 | 0.92 | 0.81</p>
<p>Soybean Cake | 4.63 | 2.22 | 1.60 | 1.42</p>
<p>Wild Grass | 4.68 | 1.40 | 1.04 | 0.94</p>
<p>Rice Leaves | 8.03 | 2.93 | 2.23 | 2.02</p>

<p>Chicken Manure | 26.18 | 10.14 | 7.44 | 6.68</p>
<p>As for purchased fertilizers, including fertilizer purchasing costs and other transportation expenses, self-supplied fertilizers are calculated at market prices when market prices are available; otherwise, the nature of the purchased fertilizer is assessed.</p>
<p>The production cost of rice is calculated separately for owner-farmers and tenant farmers, as follows:</p>
<p>1.  Owner-Farmers (Land capital interest at 4%)</p>
<p>Year | Seed Cost | Fertilizer Cost | Various Material Costs | Labor Costs | Animal Power Costs | Farming Equipment Costs | Farm Building Costs | Public Taxes | Land Capital Interest | Total</p>
<p>---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---</p>
<p>Taisho 11 | 1.14 | 17.42 | 1.54 | 35.76 | 5.04 | 2.43 | 2.14 | 10.72 | 17.04 | 103.75</p>
<p>Showa 1 | 0.78 | 15.92 | 1.47 | 29.30 | 2.89 | 2.48 | 1.94 | 10.48 | 28.11 | 93.37</p>

<p>Showa 7 | 0.40 | | 1.40 | 7.92 | 3.07 | 1.53 | 1.16 | 7.34 | 18.28 |</p>
<p>2.  Tenant Farmers</p>
<p>Taisho 12 | 2.12 | 15.57 | 2.20 | | | | | | | 99.60</p>
<p>Showa 1 | 0.94 | 14.46 | 1.48 | 25.54 | 3.07 | 1.54 | 1.08 | 0.64 | 27.40 | 89.17</p>
<p>Showa 2 | 0.77 | 11.97 | 1.77 | 28.40 | 2.52 | 1.62 | 1.27 | 0.12 | 51.04 | 79.51</p>

<p>Note: No investigation was conducted after Showa 5.</p>
<p>3.  Production Cost Per Koku of Rice</p>
<p>Year | Owner-Farmers | Tenant Farmers</p>
<p>---|---|---</p>
<p>Taisho 11 | 37.65 | 35.17</p>
<p>Showa 1 | 33.67 | 33.84</p>
<p>Showa 5 | 26.12 | ......</p>
<p>Showa 6 | 22.99 | ......</p>
<p>Showa 7 | 21.83 | ......</p>
<p>Although the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry had the Imperial Agricultural Association investigate the production cost of rice, it was not publicly announced. It was not until the agricultural panic occurred in Showa 5, with a sharp drop in rice prices, that it was realized that the previous Rice Law was powerless, and various waves arose regarding the rice price problem. In Showa 6, a major revision was decided, but in order to revise the Rice Law, the production of rice had to be clarified first. Therefore, personnel were dispatched again to conduct a thorough investigation with 1030 farm households nationwide. In March of this year, this revised Rice Law was again abolished. A new Rice Control Law was re-established, and the production cost of rice was then considered even more important. However, the purpose of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry's investigation of rice production costs was to calculate the basic production cost for rice price policy. The investigation methods included: (1) purchased fertilizers, (2) labor costs, divided into family labor and hired labor, with long-term hires calculated by monthly wage, and monthly hires calculated by actual payment, (3) farm building costs plus repair costs and site rental costs and the depreciation of farm buildings for rice cultivation, (4) taxes and public levies, (5) land capital interest for owner-farmers, (6) rent for tenant farmers, (7) the amount of harvest per koku after deducting by-product income. According to the survey results, the figures for Showa 6 and 7 are as follows:</p>
<p>| | Owner-Farmer | Tenant Farmer | Average</p>
<p>---|---|---|---</p>
<p>| | Yuan | Yuan | Yuan</p>
<p>Showa 6 | 20.27 | 19.95 | 20.11</p>
<p>Showa 7 | 21.00 | 20.71 | 20.86</p>
<h3>4. Laws and Regulations for Controlling Rice</h3>
<p>Japan already had a Rice Control Law, and the promulgation of its enforcement ordinance was a recent event, taking effect on the 1st of this month (November). Here, we will detail the main points of the Rice Control Law, and nearly the entire text of the enforcement ordinance, as much of what it says provides methods that can be used for reference.</p>
<p>Control Law: (1) The purpose of this law is to regulate the quantity and market price of rice, and to achieve the control of rice, allowing for buying and selling. (2) The government should annually set the maximum and minimum prices for rice, but in determining the minimum and maximum prices, the production cost of rice, household expenses, commodity prices, and other economic circumstances must be taken into consideration. (3) In order to maintain the minimum and maximum prices, the buying and selling of rice may be implemented upon application. (4) In order to prevent the excessive influx of rice from prefectures outside the region, or from Korea and Taiwan, during the oversupply period, rice may be purchased on a monthly average basis, and sold after the oversupply period. (5) Regarding incidental matters arising from the preceding two items of buying and selling, the government may sell rice for the purpose of storing, exchanging, processing, and organizing all rice; also, for the purpose of importing rice, buying and selling may be conducted. (6) A licensing system will be implemented for the import and export of rice. (7) When necessary, a period may be designated to restrict the import of millet and sorghum. (8) When necessary, a period may be designated to increase, decrease, or exempt the import tax on rice, millet, and sorghum.</p>
<h3>5. Control of Colonial Rice</h3>
<p>In order to maximize the effectiveness of the Rice Control Law, Japan, in addition to comprehensively planning for domestic rice, also plans to control the production of rice in Korea and Taiwan, in order to avoid conflict with domestic rice. The specific plans for controlling Korean and Taiwanese rice are described below:</p>
<p>(1) Production Control in Korea: Since the establishment of the twelve-year plan in Korea (from Taisho 15 to Showa 12) to increase production by eight million koku, the import of Korean rice into mainland Japan has been quite active, greatly affecting domestic farmers. Now that the Control Law has been promulgated, the twelve-year production increase plan must be stopped to prevent the continuous influx of Korean rice. However, in order to increase the income of Korean farmers, the authorities have established a ten-year plan starting from the next year, encouraging the cultivation of cotton. Because the production cost of cotton is low and future demand is certain to increase, it will provide a considerable benefit to farm households' own income, unlike the oversupply of rice, which leads to harvest panic. The encouragement methods include providing subsidies and lending low-interest capital to farmers. With the government's financial assistance, farmers are happy to switch crops. On the other hand, in order to secure an outlet for cotton, cotton ginning factories will be constructed.</p>
<p>(2) Control Plan for Taiwan: With the completion of the water conservancy project and the improvement of varieties in Taiwan, the rice production volume in recent years has also increased significantly, reaching nearly ten million koku. Now, in order to remedy the Control Law, rice paddies in Taiwan will be encouraged to plant sweet potatoes, and the land reclamation plan will be suspended, changing to upland cultivation of sweet potatoes. Encouraging the cultivation of sweet potatoes can not only produce refined sugar, but also be used to produce alcohol and gasoline. The encouragement methods include providing subsidies, providing low-interest capital, and constructing factories for manufacturing refined sugar, alcohol, and gasoline. Therefore, in both Korea and Taiwan, if the conversion methods are implemented, farmers' income will certainly be greater than current rice cultivation.</p>
<h3>6. Officially Set Prices and Their Shortcomings</h3>
<p>Article 5 of the Rice Control Law Enforcement Ordinance stipulates that the highest officially set price should be within the range of 20% to 30% higher than the current price situation, taking economic circumstances into consideration. According to this provision, the highest officially set price, calculated at 20% higher than the current price, is 30 yuan, 3 jiao, and 6 fen; if raised to 30%, it would be 32 yuan, 8 jiao, and 9 fen, and the price will be determined between these two numbers. As for the lowest officially set price, it is around 22 yuan and 5 jiao. However, before the lowest price was announced, the original price was around 24 yuan. After the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry put forward the numbers, it immediately decreased to 23 yuan and 7 jiao, a difference of 1 yuan and 7 jiao from the officially set lowest price of 22 yuan and 5 jiao. This is because the authorities have already taken into account the conditions of the production areas and the market price of new rice, so the national market did not become uneasy due to the newly promulgated law. However, according to the Rice Committee's argument, there was much debate regarding the standard price. Determining the standard requires deciding the relationship between the officially set prices for November and December. The lowest price should maintain all production costs, and the production cost for this year should be compared with the previous year (the previous year was 20 yuan and 8 jiao and 6 fen, which was low), with some advocating for 22 yuan and 7 jiao. In the end, the original proposal put forward by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry was still passed. The differences in officially set prices for each prefecture according to the Rice Control Law, as announced by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, are as follows:</p>
<p>| Region | Above Standard Grade When Grade 4 is the Standard | Below Standard Grade When Grade 4 is the Standard</p>
<p>---|---|---</p>
<p>| | Grade 1 | Grade 2 | Grade 3 | Grade 4 | Grade 5</p>
<p>Arakawa | 90 | 70 | 40 | 80 | 70</p>
<p>Niigata and Others | 90 | 70 | 40 | 120 | 70</p>
<p>Toyama | 120 | 90 | 50 | 120 | 70</p>
<p>Ishikawa | 120 | 90 | 50 | 120 | 60</p>
<p>Fukui | 120 | 90 | 50 | 90 | ｜｜</p>
<p>Gifu | 130 | 100 | 50 | 30 | ｜｜</p>
<p>Owari | 130 | 100 | 50 | 30 | ｜｜</p>
<p>Mikawa | 130 | 100 | 50 | 50 | ｜｜</p>
<p>Mie | 130 | 100 | 50 | 20 | ｜｜</p>
<p>Kohoku | 130 | 100 | 60 | 140 | ｜｜</p>
<p>Koto | 120 | 90 | 50 | 70 | ｜｜</p>
<p>Konan | 120 | 90 | 50 | 30 | ｜｜</p>
<p>The following 35 prefectures, including Yamashiro, are omitted.</p>
<p>Both the Japanese government and the public believe that the stipulated maximum and minimum prices are inappropriate. Why? Because when the rice price drops to the lowest price, the Japanese government has no choice but to buy rice without limit upon request. However, it is doubtful whether the government actually has the financial capacity to buy without limit. Even if it can prepare for one year, it may be difficult to cope if low prices continue for the next two or three years. Moreover, the losses incurred from buying are also unlimited. In addition, the production cost of rice, the economic situation at the time, and other related aspects should be taken into consideration when determining the lowest price. However, the production cost currently investigated by the Japanese government actually cannot include the ordinary production cost, so the set lowest price of 22 yuan and 5 jiao is still considered inappropriate. If a detailed investigation were conducted, it should be above 23 yuan. The main purpose of rice policy must be to guarantee the lowest price of rice so that it is not lower than the production cost, so that ordinary farm households can continue their business and enjoy rural life. The standard for the lowest price must include farm household business income, obtaining a considerable profit, that is, obtaining a considerable reward for the hard work of farm households in managing agriculture. This is the principle of economics. The fact that the production cost investigated by the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has not yet included management reward costs is its shortcoming. Therefore, many Japanese intellectuals advocate for a rice monopoly, but even if a rice monopoly is implemented, the national treasury will still suffer losses every year, but it is still more appropriate for maintaining rural and social stability.</p>
<h3>Enforcement Ordinance</h3>
<p>(Article 1) The minimum and maximum prices shall be officially set according to the market prices in Tokyo and Osaka in December of each year. However, the minimum and maximum prices in the preceding paragraph shall be determined by the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry based on the conditions and grades of domestic rice produced in that year, and shall be announced by the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry. (Article 2) The minimum price shall be calculated by averaging the lowest prices in various designated markets and the lowest prices of designated rice types specified by the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, according to the standard lowest price set by the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry. According to the order, the differences in prices shall be determined according to the conditions, markets, and grades of each region. The standard lowest price in the preceding paragraph shall be determined by adding transportation costs and other miscellaneous expenses to the production cost of rice produced in that year, and by calculating the price from the relationship between the rice price index and the commodity price index, within the price range specified by the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry. The price specified by the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry in the preceding paragraph shall be determined within the range of a 10% to 20% reduction below the price calculated from the relationship between the rice price index and the commodity price index, taking economic circumstances into consideration. (Article 3) The maximum price shall be determined by adding the difference between the standard price specified by the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry and the second standard minimum price to the minimum price of rice in each region, market, and grade specified in Article 2. This standard maximum price shall be determined based on the price calculated based on the household expenses surveyed for the year (household rice price), the price calculated from the relationship between the rice price index and the commodity price index, and the price range specified by the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry. The price specified by the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry above shall be determined within the range of 20% to 30% above the price calculated from the relationship between the rice price index and the commodity price index, taking economic circumstances into consideration. (Article 4) The rice production cost shall be calculated annually by averaging the production cost per koku of unpolished rice for each farm household, in accordance with the order. The production cost per koku of unpolished rice shall include the total amount of seed fertilizer labor animal power and other material costs farm buildings farming equipment taxes public levies village association fees and therefore (water control pest control prevention costs) land capital interest rent and rice inspection fees, less the amount of by-product income, divided by the number of rice income. (Article 5) Transportation costs and other costs shall be calculated according to the order, by adding up the expenses specified below: (1) Transportation costs and loading fees required in the major rice distribution centers in the areas designated by the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, (2) Railway or ship transportation costs from the land owner's major rice distribution center in the preceding paragraph to the first location, (3) Loading and unloading fees and small transportation costs required in the first location. (Article 6) The household rice price shall be determined by converting the price of one koku of polished rice to the price of one koku of unpolished rice, in accordance with the order. The price of one koku of polished rice shall be calculated annually by surveying household expenses in each region (excluding exceptions), averaging the rice price in the average household expenses, and the total amount of non-staple food expenses, hobby expenses, entertainment expenses, cultivation and entertainment expenses, travel expenses, and savings, and calculating the average of the combined number of proportional amounts separately, removing the white rice consumption amount in one region. (Article 7) The revision of the minimum and maximum prices shall be carried out in accordance with the order, based on Article 2 or Article 3. If the rice supply and demand situation undergoes a sudden change or panic occurs, the minimum and maximum prices shall be revised, but only after September 1. (Article 8) When buying or selling rice in accordance with Article 3 of the Rice Control Law, if a sales location is designated outside of Tokyo or Osaka, the market price for buying and selling may be stipulated within the range of transportation costs and other expenses from that location to Tokyo or Osaka, taking into consideration the amount specified by the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry. (Article 9) If any of the following circumstances exist, the government may refuse to buy or sell the application in accordance with the Rice Control Law: (1) When the application quantity does not reach the quantity specified in the order; (2) When the purpose is bulk buying or seeking improper profits. (Article 10) When applying to buy at the highest price, if the market and grade of rice in the buying application is not available, the government may sell other markets and grades of rice, except for expressing opposition to the buying applicant at the time of application. (Article 11) In accordance with the provisions of Article 3 of the Rice Control Law, the quantity of domestic rice purchased shall be the monthly average of the estimated quantity moved out during the year for the current rice year, which is for April. The limit shall be the quantity deducted from the total amount of the estimated quantity moved out from each month between November and February of the following year. The limit on the quantity of Korean and Taiwanese rice purchased shall be based on the quantity calculated in the preceding paragraph. (Article 12) The quantity of rice purchased in accordance with the provisions of Article 4 of the Rice Control Law shall be sold within the current rice year; however, this shall not apply when the market and grade designated by the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry and the average market price designated by the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry are above the standard minimum price and are 5% more expensive. (Article 13) In accordance with the provisions of Article 3 of the Rice Control Law, the buying and selling of Korean and Taiwanese rice shall be conducted in the respective places of origin; however, this shall not apply when there are special circumstances. (Article 14) When exchanging rice, the buying and selling shall be carried out at the same time; however, this shall not apply to those who sell between August and October and buy after the new rice is harvested. (Article 15) Prefectures that borrow rice shall lend or sell the rice to cities, towns, villages, industrial associations, agricultural associations, etc. under appropriate conditions set by the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry. (Article 16) Prefectures that receive rice loans shall return the rice of the same quantity as the borrowed rice on the date specified by the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry. The rice to be returned in accordance with the above paragraph shall be rice produced in the year or the previous year belonging to the return period specified by the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, and shall still be carried out with the same market and grade or with the same grade. (Article 17) In accordance with the provisions of Article 7 of the Rice Control Law, the permission for rice import and export shall be granted by the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry in the mainland, and by the local governors in Korea, Taiwan, and Sakhalin. (Article 18) No permission is required in accordance with the provisions of Article 7 of the Rice Control Law when it relates to the following items: (1) When there are special provisions in commercial navigation treaties; (2) When the government, in accordance with the Rice Control Law, entrusts rice import or export to buy and sell rice; (3) When ship supplies or passengers' luggage, sample rice, and rice of the same nature are allowed to be imported and exported.</p>

<h3>Finance: The Sluggish State of Silver Dollars During the Holiday</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the usual Sunday holiday. Banks, both Chinese and foreign, large and small, were closed, so the market atmosphere was desolate. In the market, the foreign exchange discount, both in the morning and afternoon markets, remained at six fen. There were no transactions for assigned transactions. In ticket exchange transactions, turnover was 3.45 million in the morning market and over 700,000 in new transactions. In the afternoon market, turnover was over 300,000. The Small General Association received over 400,000, and Qian Zhuang (money shops) settled over 35.5 million in silver dollar public notes. Remittances from various regions were stagnant, and business to and from customers was consistently suspended. Jiangnan small silver dollars remained comparable to the previous day, at 830 yuan, both in the morning and afternoon, with a morning market turnover of 4,000 jiao (1 jiao = 1/10 yuan) and an afternoon market turnover of 2,000 jiao. Guangdong small silver dollars were 788 yuan and 5 jiao in the morning market, and 788 yuan and 7 jiao in the afternoon market, resulting in an increase of 9 jiao compared to the previous day's afternoon market, with a morning market turnover of 70,000 jiao and an afternoon market turnover of 50,000 jiao. The price of copper coins fluctuated by 1,500 cash, totaling 304,000 cash, with a turnover of 34,620 strings (1 string = 1,000 cash), equivalent to 11,200 silver dollars.</p>

<h3>Securities Last Week, the Bond Market Gradually Returned to Normal</h3>
<p>Last week, from October 30th to November 4th, the market price of the Chinese Securities Exchange was very stable, which can be regarded as a good phenomenon in recent years. After the turmoil of Finance Minister Song's resignation the previous week, it quickly calmed down, exceeding the expectations of some people. This shows the people's deep understanding of government bonds, which is very different from the turmoil of the Angell case in the past. Although the environments of the past and present are different, the biggest reason is that the public's belief in government bonds has increased significantly compared to the past, beyond measure. It is now found that the total amount of outstanding accounts in the exchange has exceeded 50 million yuan on one side alone. The number of those that cannot be investigated is not included in this figure, making it the highest record in recent years. The stalemate between the two sides has lasted for a week, which also shows that the forces of both bulls and bears are extremely strong. Based on this speculation, even if there are no changes in the future environment, the collision of chips between the two sides is enough to cause greater fluctuations. Last week, Monday was the closing day for October futures, so the market was closed. On Tuesday, December futures were auctioned. With Kong succeeding Song, someone was in charge of finance, and the turmoil of Finance Minister Song's resignation quickly subsided. The market was calm, and trading also decreased. Only retailers and numbers 4 and 46 had some needs, and the market price rebounded, with the larger gains being half a yuan. On Wednesday, rumors suddenly spread that a certain important person was also tired of his job, and short selling started again. Retail bulls emerged, and the market price fell by a small fraction of a yuan or more. From this, it can be seen that people's hearts are still weak and easily swayed by external influences. Thursday and Friday were very calm, with a lot of sideways movement, fluctuating up and down, with minimal changes, with the larger movements not exceeding three or four cents. On Saturday, Finance Minister Kong stated that there were solutions for finance, and people's hearts stabilized. Number 4 bought in a lot, and the market price rebounded by about one yuan. In summary, the market price for the week increased by one or two cents to six or seven cents. The total transaction volume was 58.033 million yuan, including 3,000 yuan in spot goods, 22.96 million yuan in futures for both consolidated and salt taxes, 8.8 million yuan in troop reduction, 6.425 million yuan in 19 Customs, and 12.59 million yuan in 20 Customs. The rest ranged from tens of thousands to about one million yuan.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Overseas Cotton Market Declines Universally</h3>
<p>Yesterday's US cotton market was mixed, awaiting government reports. It initially fell due to Southern hedging sales, but then rebounded due to Japanese purchases. As a result, spot prices fell by 5 points, and futures fell by 5 to 7 points. Liverpool cotton spot prices fell by 2 points, and futures fell by 1 point. Egyptian cotton spot prices were unchanged. The Bombay cotton market initially fell due to long positions closing, but then rebounded due to retail and Japanese purchases. As a result, Pingal and Barroach both fell by 7.5 angles, and Omlara fell by half a rubie. (Reported on the 4th)</p>

<h3>Grain Commonly Helped Su Tong Japonica Rice Slightly Tight</h3>
<p>(Jinan) Yesterday, there were more than 30 sources, totaling more than 4,000 stones. Due to the rain, there were few customers, and more than 3,000 stones were sold wholesale and retail. The transaction was light and still average. However, the sellers once shouted high prices, and commonly helped Su Tong and other Japonica rice to be slightly tight. Nankang and other thick rice varieties were still stable. Du Yang pointed rice had no significant gains or losses. Various broken Japonica rice were sluggish due to the season. Yin Yuan liquor households moved slightly, and the market color was still excellent. Late rice was booked in packages, and the market was average.</p>

<p>Conversations</p>
<h3>Teachers and Students For Supplemental Education</h3>
<p>— Xu Lin</p>
<p>In any school, of course, there is a need for [spirited, experienced, and interested teachers], but at the same time, there must also be [spirited, persistent, and hardworking students].</p>
<p>Recently, two articles about [teachers] have been continuously published in this publication, both of which seem to be from the perspective of [students], and the discussion seems to be specifically about [supplemental education]. As for me, I used to run [supplemental education] and believe that I still have a considerable understanding of [supplemental education], so I can't help but speak up for [teachers] and cry [injustice].</p>
<p>Of course, a teacher is also a person, and being a person means they have to [eat], so it cannot be dismissed as [making a living]. And in the heart of every teacher, there is no one who does not want to teach students well. So the reason for not teaching well is still a question of [ability].</p>
<p>However, in [supplemental schools], it is more difficult to be a [teacher]. Because the most difficult thing is the significant difference in levels. Often, when it suits the students with lower levels, those with higher levels do not feel interested, and when teaching is slightly more advanced, the lower levels feel that they cannot keep up. At this time, [the teacher can only provide more detailed explanations at the standard level from time to time, to cater to students with lower levels while arousing the interest of students with higher levels. However, this requires [profound knowledge].</p>
<p>But, on the other hand, this responsibility cannot be entirely borne by the teacher alone. The so-called students who automatically join supplemental education with the money earned from their own labor and sweat often do so on a temporary impulse and rarely have lasting commitment. Therefore, by the end of the semester, students who consistently do not skip classes can be said to be as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. This is also the regret I had in the past and the sigh that has been aroused today.</p>
<p>I have also conducted a detailed investigation into the reasons why students gradually decrease, and the conclusion is nothing more than the following points...</p>
<p>First, there is no perseverance. Initially, it is due to a temporary impulse, feeling that their knowledge needs to be supplemented. However, after one or two months, they feel that it is plain and unremarkable, so [catching up] is withdrawn. However, one or two months is certainly not beneficial. The second is difficulty moving forward. The time for supplemental education is not as long as general [education], so it must be developed faster. Therefore, general students are busy with affairs and have no time to study, or simply use reading as a pastime. Try to imagine engaging in [supplemental education] which shortens the time several times compared to [general education] in such circumstances. Of course, they will not feel any [interest], resulting in discouragement and cessation! However, there are exceptions.</p>
<p>In short, the difficulty in achieving satisfactory results in [supplemental education] is definitely not solely the teacher's responsibility. Students must also bear considerable responsibility. Because, on the one hand, the teacher's [patient guidance] is needed, and at the same time, the student's [constant effort] is also necessary in order to cooperate and complement each other.</p>
<p>The current [supplemental education] has not yet emerged from its infancy and still needs a large amount of construction to achieve universality. At the same time, it is necessary to recognize the importance of [supplemental education]. Because in the current social system of economic bankruptcy, there are ultimately very few who can go from elementary school to middle school to university. Completing middle school is already rare, let alone those who are employed, most of whom, after graduating from elementary school, are unable to continue their studies because they have to solve their livelihood problems. Pursuing knowledge while employed is the most reasonable work-study life. Therefore, the maintenance and assistance of [supplemental education] is something that no one should shirk and is an unavoidable duty.</p>
<p>The [problems] seen in [supplemental schools] a few years ago are probably still applicable today? I ask this of experts engaged in [supplemental education].</p>
<h3>On [Status]</h3>
<p>— Kuang</p>
<p>The term [status] is very familiar, but it is not widely used in the authority of human beings. For example, some hardworking friends who use their hands and feet and sell their shoulder strength do not know what is called [status], and simply cannot even conceive of the idea. They are cautious to maintain themselves by exchanging blood and sweat for some [kuapao] (I dare not say some [daluo]) every day. They just go to the Tizhuang shop to sell a blue cloth gown, squat on the side of the road to chew Shandong noodles, and sleep in places like the kitchen shed at night, snoring loudly. They do not care about anything else.</p>
<p>However, [status] is not only familiar, but many people are very particular about it. Generally speaking, it is used by more outstanding figures in society, including officials, compradors, brokers, teachers in schools, college students who are said to be studying, and friends who specialize in playing. They generally have two or three points of leisure in their lives.</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that [status] and [wealth] (that is, the possession of wealth and social influence, etc.) have very deep origins. People with more wealth tend to value [status] and elevate [status].</p>
<p>But there are also friends who are said to lack [overnight rice] who are very particular about [status]. This inevitably leads to embarrassing literati, who are also some outstanding individuals.</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that paying attention to [status] must have some inevitable benefits. Speaking of which, it is actually vague. What exactly is it? Where exactly are the benefits? It is really difficult to explain. It is originally an invisible and intangible abstract sense of self-esteem. Arranging the scene is like a horse running across the sky, floating and soaring, only seeing it flying towards the boundless outer space. Originally, [status] is a reflection of real life, but people whose real life is declining still anxiously maintain it, and even want to improve it. In short, [status] is a manifestation of the spirit and consciousness constantly climbing upwards.</p>
<p>As for its benefits, I really cannot understand them and feel that there are none. If there are any, then I can only say that it is Ah Q's spiritual comfort.</p>
<p>Coming back to the topic, the magic power created by people who pay attention to [status] and [status] can indeed be written straight down, drawing a long record, starting from the lifestyle performances of food, clothing, and housing.</p>
<p>For example, on Saturday night, the express train from Nanjing has several clean officials who are particular about [status]. Because they are clean officials, their wallets may not be very heavy. In order to visit friends in Shanghai, or have other important matters, if they stay in a small hotel, they often have to learn from important people and follow behind, stepping into some big hotels. Although their faces are a bit unnatural and their fingers are a bit flustered when paying the bill, because they are officials, and officials of the capital, staying in small hotels is too low [status], so they have to reluctantly stay in big hotels.</p>
<p>For example, an extremely poor intellectual whose meal expenses for the day are not very certain, but for the sake of [status], even if he is not full, he has to step into a high-rise elegant seat. In genuine, reasonably priced food stalls, there are only some disreputable coolies mixing, which is absolutely impossible to squeeze into with [status].</p>
<p>For example, a national who has studied abroad and eats Western meat sauce while wandering around the crossroads clearly has some inconvenience at hand at the moment, and only has enough to sew a [312]-type cloth gown, but he will definitely not do this. He insists on going to Wusong Road to buy old Western clothes, simply because of [status] reasons. Wearing a long gown after studying abroad is the most embarrassing thing.</p>
<p>Ah! [Status] is originally such a set of tricks!</p>
<p>Ah! [Status] is originally such a set of tricks!</p>
<p>[Status] [Status] [Status], is it hypocrisy?</p>
<h3>Eating Memories of a Fragment of School Life</h3>
<p>— Ren</p>
<p>Having run out of the school gates for almost a year now, recalling the state of life in school, I cannot help but find it amusing, especially the scene in the dining hall, which is even more humorously interesting. Every time before breakfast, lunch, and dinner, the preparation bell always rings first. Then, several of our classmates, in groups of three or five, wait at the entrance of the dining hall, waiting for the final bell to ring. We then rush straight to the dining hall. Although the dishes and rice served in the dining hall cannot be described as delicious, they are at least undoubtedly filling. Therefore, for us who have been hungry for three or four hours in class, it is more delicious than delicacies, conquering our stomachs that are singing the empty city strategy! In short, we at that time walked into the dining hall with great ambition, as if we were the great powers nibbling on the Republic of China, nibbling on the food arranged in the dining hall. We all said, [This is China, China with more than 4,000 years of culture...]</p>
<p>Eight people, actually enough, sat fully around a table. After saying prayers and singing the meal song (as is probably the case in church schools), we began to implement my policies, using my weapons—chopsticks and spoons—at our table. There were those who were as timid as rabbits, those who were as fierce as lions, and those who were as cunning as foxes. Sometimes we looked at each other with ferocious smiles. Our eyes sharply</p>
<p>Modern Celebrity Calligraphy Gu Yaoyun, a native of Wujin, Jiangsu, studies calligraphy with profound attainments</p>
<p>Yang Xiong, more than forty years old, toured the capital, and Wang Yin, the General of Chariots and Cavalry of the Sima, admired his article. He was summoned to be a subordinate official. After a year or more of waiting, he presented a Hunting Fu and was appointed as a servant in the Yellow Gate. The elders for a long time were transformed into great men. Piano benefits are ancient and happy. Gu Yaoyun of Biling in the month of Guiyou</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>They looked at the only five small dishes with the flames of desire. We all aimed our eyes and used our weapons, chopsticks and spoons, to attack. In our hearts, we were all thinking like this... [The early bird gets the worm! Ah! If you eat one more piece, then I will eat one less. I have lost the right to eat! This food is so unique to this table, and it is so calm and sings its policy of non-resistance, allowing us to exploit, trample on, and annex it without caring. Don't fall behind in starting!] So we devoured the food until we were full, and proudly ran out of the dining hall door. Those at the same table who were as timid as rabbits were still half-full and half-hungry, watching others salivate and sighing at the empty bowls. This dining table, which had been trampled on by a gluttonous meal, with its cups and chopsticks in a mess, was finally left unattended.</p>
<h3>[Running Dogs]</h3>
<p>— Ji Xue</p>
<p>The inventions of scientists bring convenience and comfort to people's lives. Undoubtedly, they deserve the admiration of all generations. However, the evils caused by scientific advancement, which harm all generations, cannot be denied by anyone.</p>
<p>Gambling, which exploits the instinct of animals of the same kind to kill and fight each other, is also quite prevalent in our country. Things like cockfighting and cricket fighting have a very long history.</p>
<p>Exploiting the instincts of dogs to hunt rabbits, chase rabbits, and compete with each other, led to the invention of [dog racing].</p>
<p>[Dog racing] was invented by the British and has been popular for a long time. The British are even more enthusiastic about [dog racing] than people in other countries. Major British cities such as London, Liverpool, and Manchester all have grand and well-organized dog racing tracks.</p>
<p>Except for Fridays (?), there are grand events every night of the week, which is quite astonishing. The dog racing track is surrounded by tiered stands, which can accommodate more than ten thousand spectators/gamblers. The scale of the winnings and losses is beyond our imagination. The profound and enormous harm it causes to society is thus evident.</p>
<p>No matter what it is, when it is first invented, it is inevitably crude and poorly made. Only after many experiments and improvements can it be satisfactory. [Dog racing] is no exception.</p>
<p>When [dog racing] was first developed, the gambling method involved releasing a live rabbit in front of the dogs. When the dogs saw it, they would chase after it, and the order in which they finished would determine the winners. However, the live rabbit's running path was unpredictable, and it was easily frightened and caught by the dogs, resulting in chaos. The judges could not make precise judgments. Over time, the electric rabbit was invented. The operator of the electric rabbit could control it as desired, and the dogs [wanted to eat swan meat] but could not catch it, and would forever [not recognize the true face of Mount Lu]. They run around the track every day, unable to see through the deception. Scientists say [dogs have the sharpest vision]. I have some doubts.</p>
<p>Besides England, the country with the most [dog fans] is probably America.</p>
<p>Eight years ago, [dog racing] followed the European and American trends and spread to our esteemed China, to Shanghai.</p>
<p>During the first few nights of the opening of the Ming Garden, the people of this city seemed to be witnessing a grand ceremony. They said in astonishment, "[Foreigners are really capable. [Dog racing] can be used for gambling]." Driven by curiosity, people went to visit in groups. All kinds of cars lined up from the Waibaidu Bridge to Huade Road. The millions of residents along the road, young and old,</p>
<p>were dancing and cheering, watching the unprecedented spectacle. Alas, over the years, many fellow citizens who smoke opium, hang themselves, take sleeping pills, and jump into the Huangpu River are dog racing addicts. Their [suicidal thoughts] were conceived from that year's [curiosity].</p>
<p>Dog tickets are divided into two types: win and place. Some cost two yuan each, some five yuan, some ten yuan, and some twenty-five yuan. There are also double win tickets and lottery tickets.</p>
<p>The dog racing track takes a commission of as much as 11 percent. I have a friend who studies economics. He said, "[If we bring a hundred yuan to the dog racing track, even if we don't win or lose, after they take commissions more than ten times, our money will vanish into thin air]." I deeply pondered his words and found them very reasonable and alarming.</p>
<p>The dogs at the dog racing track can be broadly divided into Australian breeds and British breeds. The former are stronger and faster than the latter. Therefore, the dogs at the Shanghai dog racing track are all purchased from Australia. Now, customs prohibits the import of racing dogs. The officials of the dog racing track are deeply concerned that over time, the imported dogs will inevitably grow old and die. The protagonists will become extinct. How can they maintain the business? Of course, they must [prepare for a rainy day]. They breed the older dogs with each other to produce puppies. The dog racing track and the dog owners divide the puppies equally. The dog racing track can then sell them for a large profit. The puppies can compete in the track after a dozen months after they are born. I think Shanghai will become a [dog world] in a few decades.</p>
<p>The owners of the dog racing track keep the original price they paid when they hired [superstar performers] abroad and [purchased racing dogs] a secret. We outsiders have no way of finding out. Once they are transported to Shanghai, their value increases tenfold. Each dog costs from several hundred yuan to several thousand yuan. We Chinese are also willing to pay a high price to buy them. It is stipulated that the dog racing track will continue to raise them. The dog owners must pay a monthly dog food fee of 20 yuan.</p>
<p>The reason why dog owners are willing to spend huge amounts of money to buy a dog is the same as that of real estate developers buying real estate. Real estate developers can collect rent, and dog owners can get [purse money] (after deducting one-tenth to reward the dog handler). The purse money is also divided into several levels, based on the quality of the dog. It is roughly 100 yuan, 110 yuan, 120 yuan, 130 yuan, 140 yuan, 150 yuan, and 160 yuan, for a total of seven types. For example, if the first dog gets 100 yuan, then the second dog gets 50 yuan, and the third dog gets 30 yuan, and so on. Dog owners who are blessed with good luck have income every week, which seems to be more profitable than any other industry. Those with bad luck may not get a single penny for several months. However, the dog racing track will never allow them to delay the food fee, and the amount will never be reduced. It is still 20 yuan per month.</p>
<p>The most unlucky ones spend as much as they would to marry a concubine. They just bought a dog, and unfortunately it gets sick. They hire a dog doctor to treat it. It cannot compete in the track for half a year or a year. Both medical expenses and food expenses are indispensable. If it dies of illness or epidemic, the dog owner's assets have no guarantee. This kind of risk is even more severe than doing speculative business.</p>
<p>[Dog racing] has been in China for seven or eight years. Most of the first batch of dogs that were transported here are old. It is very unlikely that they will continue their rabbit-chasing life at the dog racing track in order to generate profits for the dog owners, so they will naturally be eliminated. According to regulations, the officials of the dog racing track will notify the dog owners in writing, requiring them to take back the old dogs before a certain date. If you delay, the dog racing track will execute the old dog – by shooting it.</p>
<p>Young and strong racing dogs [wear their heads well]. (Note: This is a common term among dog fans.) Everything about them is good. They are all extraordinarily loved. Once they get old, they are treated like thorns in their eyes. [Dog, dog, what have you been running for all your life? Those who build foreign houses and drive cars all have blue eyes. [When people get old, their value decreases.] They will definitely not repay you. We Chinese have been harmed to death by you. I don't know how many people. So you won't have a good ending.]</p>
<p>There is also a very unique thing that I might as well mention in passing.</p>
<p>The temperament of racing dogs can be gentle or irritable. Gentle dogs only chase the electric rabbit in a docile manner. Irritable dogs like to fight with other dogs in the middle of the race. The board of directors of the dog racing track actually held a round table meeting after this dog race. After discussing it once, they issued an order to suspend the [fighting dog] from performing its duties for a few months or a few weeks. If the dog does not change its original nature in the next race, it is often decided to expel it. It costs thousands of yuan to replace a dog uncle. To us poor scholars, it is very painful. I advise my fellow countrymen, you can do anything with money. Open shops, run industries, there is glory in every place. Why spend huge amounts of money to become a dog owner? You are completely under the control of foreigners, trying to get small profits. Moreover, it is really difficult to be a dog owner. How many people can get rich from this kind of industry?</p>
<h3>Upstairs and Downstairs</h3>
<p>— Xiao Songjiang</p>
<p>As I stepped into the barbershop, the owner bowed and said with a smile, "[Please go upstairs]."</p>
<p>The six seats downstairs were already occupied by those who had arrived first. I stepped up the stairs without thinking, only to see two naked legs flash before my eyes. "[Upstairs is for female customers]." I suddenly remembered and stopped. But the owner, being tactful, opened his mouth again, "[Sir, please go upstairs]."</p>
<p>I seemed to have no choice but to step upstairs proudly. I thought, "[Upstairs for female customers]" can be specially accommodated when it comes to business. Chinese people are very accommodating when it comes to business.</p>
<p>There were already two female customers upstairs. One had just sat down and was resting her two naked legs. I sat down in a seat next to her.</p>
<p>"[Haircut?]" the barber in white asked me. I nodded.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, he showed me the hair at the back of my head in another mirror.</p>
<p>"[A little thinner]," I didn't study hairstyles because I was naturally too lazy to go to the barbershop. I always wanted it shorter when I got a haircut.</p>
<p>"[Thinner means shorter!]" He seemed to think I didn't appreciate his haircutting skills.</p>
<p>"[I want it shorter!]" I replied angrily.</p>
<p>After a few more minutes of rough work, the face shaping was over. His face was always stretched tight, without a single gap. At this time, the owner's "[Sir, please go upstairs]" entered my ears again.</p>
<p>I paid the money and glanced at the female customer who was resting her two naked legs. The barber (?) hadn't even touched her hair with his scissors.</p>
<p>I went downstairs, and that gentleman came up in a hurry.</p>
<p>"[For the owner, upstairs and downstairs are the same in terms of business; but for the employee, there is such a big difference between upstairs and downstairs in terms of skill]." I still didn't understand the reason for this when I wrote this manuscript.</p>
<p>Drama</p>
<h3>War and Peace (VI)(Three Act Play) - Written after the Play</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Now, this script has finally been completed one after another. Readers, at this moment, I have an indescribable lightness in my heart. Of course, I wrote this script with my greatest effort, and I poured all my enthusiasm into it from beginning to end.</p>
<p>Now, even I myself dare not believe in my own abilities, but I finally finished it.</p>
<p>Of course, this is thanks to this great era; semi-colonial China has been invaded to such an extent. What excites us even more is that we young people are living on the eve of this great transformation. The First World War began and ended before our eyes, and now a new massacre is about to begin. In this era, why shouldn't I devote all my energy to writing this script?</p>
<p>In this way, this [War and Peace] is not so much a historical record. Moreover, almost everything written here is true material, and I can responsibly tell the readers. Pure documentary dramas or report dramas are very much needed in China today, but unfortunately, I have not completely adopted the various forms mentioned above here.</p>
<p>However, it is undeniable that this incident occupies the most important page in the national history of China. Because of this, when I was writing, my friends' encouragement and supervision of my responsibilities were particularly enthusiastic. This made me feel infinitely frightened. At the same time, I also received letters from friends I did not know, which were all appreciated and thanked here! As for the editors of this publication being able to give me such valuable space to publish, I should be sincerely grateful!</p>
<p>In addition, there are some additional explanations about the drama itself.</p>
<p>This script does not have a protagonist from the beginning. I think this allows for a more lively depiction of this event, without being constrained by the story. At the same time, I don't want to use a few typical characters to represent this event.</p>
<p>For the convenience of the performance, I attempted to make each act exist independently.</p>
<p>As for putting this script on stage as a whole, there are of course many difficulties in the current situation in China. This is not only to say that there are too many people and it is difficult to direct, but in fact it also requires a very large stage. However, I have written quite meticulously about the arrangement of the scenes.</p>
<p>As for the many errors in this printing, it is simply too much to correct. If there is a possibility of printing it into a single book in the future, it should be carefully proofread and revised.</p>
<p>Finally, I hope to get strict criticism from friends and noble readers who are engaged in drama or literature. I await this. (End)</p>

<h3>An Interview with Chinese Film Artists (19) (Continued from Yesterday)</h3>
<p>— Sha Ji</p>
<p>(8) [Remnants of Spring] Director Zhang Shichuan (Continued)</p>
<p>From the above words, we know that Mr. Zhang is very enthusiastic about sports. According to Mr. Cheng Bugao's explanation from the side, "[This means generally improving sports performance]." Frankly speaking, taking a large amount of money from the common people to raise athletes is not a bad thing for the country. For example, Liu Changchun's short-distance running still represents Liaoning (that is, Fengtian in [Manchukuo]!) this year and equaled the record of the Far Eastern Games, which is so glorious. Afterwards, I asked again;</p>
<p>"[Mr. Zhang, what are your opinions on the current Chinese film industry?]"</p>
<p>"[Very simple,]" he said; "[The main thing for current Chinese films is to attract the audience. Only when there is an audience can we instill ideas. Even if there are good ideas, people have to watch them. If they don't watch them, it's still useless...]"</p>
<p>"[Hmm, great, great... So what are Mr. Zhang's opinions on his own works?]"</p>
<p>"[I'm an old bum,]" he was too polite. "[I'm very busy with my work and I shouldn't be directing. But for the company's business, in order to make the company develop, I have to direct films. To be honest, I'm not satisfied with my own works. I almost only watch each production once, and I don't even want to watch it a second time... But there are many reasons for this, the main one being that my works are all produced very quickly. It is definitely not good for the company if the productions are too slow. It is only when it is faster and faster that the cost can be maintained... I don't think that a film that takes one or two years to make will necessarily have ten or twenty times the results.]"</p>
<p>These are all inside words. At this time, Mr. Cheng Bugao came to explain again.</p>
<p>"[In fact, the slowness of the work is not necessarily the slowness of the director. For example, after a set is filmed, it always takes more than a week to film the second set. In this way, only three sets can be filmed in a month. Suppose a play has twenty sets, then it will take seven months to film them. Not counting the location shots, there is still the work of editing and revising. Generally, a silent film takes about 200 working hours from First Camera to Last Cut...]"</p>
<p>Finally, I thought that Mr. Zhang had gone to Jiangxi to shoot a film about suppressing the communists, and he must have gained a lot of insights into the actual situation in Jiangxi. So I asked;</p>
<p>"[Mr. Zhang, how many times have you been to Jiangxi? Can you tell us some of your personal opinions?]"</p>
<p>"[I went to Jiangxi because Generalissimo Chiang needed to shoot a sound film, so I went to help. As for the matter of suppressing the bandits, I think this question is too big, and I don't want to say anything...]"</p>
<p>Our conversation ended here, because he was very busy, so it was not convenient to ask more. However, in this short conversation, we can have a considerable understanding of him. (8) End)</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3>Review of [Tears of Separation] – Shown in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>We often have a forgiving attitude towards the productions of small companies because their capital is tight and they lack talent. We even lower the standard to give it an appropriate evaluation. This attitude is not to have high hopes for small companies, and try to encourage them to work hard and progress. But this does not mean that we unconditionally pardon small companies. At least for the author's ideology, we must give it a very correct evaluation. If we do not strictly criticize the author's vulgar selection of themes and the resulting incoherent story, it is equivalent to becoming their prisoner, or even an accomplice to murder. Therefore, we can forgive the performance skills to a certain extent due to objective facts, but we must adhere to subjective opinions on the review of the content.</p>
<p>After watching the Lone Star Company's [Tears of Separation], I first had the above opinions. The fact is that we must not easily ignore the efforts of the authors of [Tears of Separation]. For example, because there is not enough lighting to use, we have to shoot in sunlight. Everyone knows that it is inevitable that this will affect the perfection of the work. In particular, it is even more admirable that we were able to have such clear photography with just a few reflectors, and we should admire the photographer's success. At the same time, we are unfortunate enough to encounter strong winds, and the small props in the set are inevitably blown around. It is very obvious that we can also see the lack of tight capital. Can we not be quite tolerant of these? As for the war scenes, in order to save money, we have to cut and insert old films.</p>
<p>However, our tolerance can only go so far. We can no longer lower our standards for the evaluation of the content. Even if it is a production of a small company, it must be measured correctly with the same standards, just like criticizing the so-called productions of large companies. Some may say that because of the lack of capital, it is not possible to obtain sound talent. However, so-called sound talents are by no means all geniuses. What's more, so-called geniuses are not necessarily correct in their handling of themes. Tolstoy or Balzac are both genius creators, but their ideologies are often strictly opposed by later generations.</p>
<p>The reason for mentioning Tolstoy and Balzac is that they are both the best realists. What we want to see in movies is [truth]. Furthermore, we want to see the [truth] of tomorrow in the [truth] of today. However, the authors of [Tears of Separation] desperately somersaulted in a legendary story. Although the screenwriter confidently wrote the story in a very tortuous way, it is precisely because of the incoherent twists and turns that the story is even more bizarre.</p>
<p>A division commander's daughter would fall in love with a groom for no reason (it is said that both the explanation and the subtitles say [horse officer]. This strange and incoherent official title is really the first time I have seen it). This kind of thing only happens in Peking operas like throwing embroidered balls, where there are characters like Wang Baochuan and Xue Pinggui who are neither fish nor fowl. So the division commander's daughter refused to marry the glorious staff officer, and the so-called socialite also rose up in revolution. (However, the screenwriter explained here that it was for the sake of revenge. The forced nature of this is clear.) Later, the evil-doing division commander was killed by another groom, but he didn't know to call the guards. The young lady became a nun in the nunnery, and the staff officer committed suicide with great kindness after the victory of the Northern Expeditionary Army. As a result, the so-called [horse officer] and the socialite were reunited.</p>
<p>During the Northern Expedition, the National Revolutionary Army did have glorious records in the anti-warlord sense because of the people's enthusiastic support. Even now, taking anti-warlordism as the theme of the film still has great significance. However, the authors, because they did not understand enough, had no way to realize this theme, and could only vulgarly associate it with an incoherent legend. What's more, the work itself was originally based on love as the warp and the national revolution as the weft. Therefore, retribution, heavenly principles, conscience, the so-called seeing through the world, becoming a monk or committing suicide, successfully completed this Tears of Separation.</p>
<p>As for the director's lack of skill, it is even more obvious. For example, on the staff officer's wedding night, the father-in-law and daughter-in-law would actually go to the socialite's place together, but the subtitles said that the wedding was three or four days ago. And the young lady stole the division commander's seal in front of everyone to save her lover, and after a long time, the division commander and the socialite only walked from the flower hall into the bedroom. The actors were also insufficient, very strained. As for the subtitles, there were even more incoherent ones.</p>
<p>According to a friend, this is an earlier work, so it cannot reflect any changes in this transition. If so, then we hope that the authors will quickly recognize the trend of the times and not be willing to lag behind.</p>
<h3>Review of [Dawn] Beijing Screening</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>In recent years, domestic films have tended toward a new style. Not only have major companies changed their filmmaking policies regarding their usual romance films, but even smaller companies have gradually embarked on this new path.</p>
<p>Therefore, we went to see [Dawn], which bills itself as better than [Wild Rose], with great anticipation.</p>
<p>However, while this film is much better than the films of the smaller Guo Fu company, overall, it was a great disappointment to us.</p>
<p>Taking the anti-Japanese and anti-imperialist struggle of rural stone miners as its theme is excellent. However, the screenwriter wrote it as if romance is above all else, even writing that A Xiang resolutely fights the enemy because of A Wei's urging. As for A Wei, perhaps the intention was to write her as so-called more fiery and courageous than [Wild Rose]. Look, when she hears hand-to-hand combat in the back mountains, she bravely walks onto the battlefield, unarmed, where the hand-to-hand combat is taking place. And He Sanbao is an absolute hero in this film. He issues orders, publishes notices... [Only direct combat with clear weapons is allowed, no killing with hidden arrows.] He also goes to rescue A Xiang in the so-called [hand-to-hand combat] area unarmed. What an ideal hero this is! Although writing about the miners using their own strength, such as throwing stones at the enemy when their bullets run out, and smashing iron pots to stuff into gun holes as bullets, is commendable, making people superstitious about a hero while shirking their own responsibilities is a great failure.</p>
<p>In the end, the film explains that A Xiang fights the enemy to gain A Wei's understanding and love, completely obliterating the great significance of the entire anti-Japanese and anti-imperialist war.</p>
<p>But the warriors who died fighting to defend our land, we didn't see a single shot of them.</p>
<p>The director, in a small company with limited finances, generally did a decent job. However, many places are too brief. For example... When A Xiang sees a rabbit, one shot is just a very long shot of A Xiang alone, and it's not until after he shoots and walks to where the rabbit died that we see it. When Sanbao fights Shi Meng, it's immediately obvious that it's someone pretending. Although some foreign wildlife footage is cut in, it doesn't feel tense at all. After A Xiang puts on a new pair of shoes at home, he hasn't even taken a step, but the next shot is already in front of the door of another room. When He Sanbao and A Wei return after talking by the stream, there is actually a person's head in the foreground. If this head is A Xiang's, then A Xiang is clearly hiding behind a tree. After Sanbao kills the enemy, he immediately hugs the injured A Xiang and doesn't let go. Is it that all the enemies have been killed, and this is the only person who came for [hand-to-hand combat]? There are also many other minor problems and disjointed actions in the upper and lower shots.</p>
<p>The cinematography may be due to financial constraints and filmed with substandard equipment, so many scenes are as white as electric lights. Especially the actors' faces, many only show white faces, black eyes, lips, and hair. The night is also filmed brighter than the daytime.</p>
<p>Many of the sets are very good. The explanation has two or three descriptions that are too [profound], making it difficult to understand their meaning.</p>
<p>Regarding the actors' expressions and actions, Wang Feijuan, who plays A Wei, doesn't act like an innocent and lively [Wild Rose] at all, and her expressions are also unnatural. Wang Chunyuan, who plays A Xiang, has no expression. On the other hand, Zhang Yuting, who plays He Sanbao, does a good job, although many parts are too over the top and too slow. Many of the extras' expressions are inexplicable to the audience. Naturally, the director should be responsible for this.</p>
<p>In short, this film is relatively progressive for a small company. We hope that they will continue to work hard to produce more complete and progressive works in the future.</p>

<h3>Dinner at Eight (5)</h3>
<p>— Ma Teng</p>
<p>The maid Dina was helping Kitty put on her shoes, and she was also looking at the diamond-encrusted bracelet on her mistress's wrist, which was exactly what she had always wanted. She put on Kitty's shoes and went out. Packard continued, [Why do you care about those Jordans, what do you care about New York? We're going to Washington anyway. The president has already invited me. What do you say to being a cabinet minister's wife?] Kitty said, [I don't care. I'm not going to that ranch. Girl Scout awards, tea parties for soldiers' children, playing ball on the White House lawn. Ugh, I'm going to do those things! You go to Washington, I'll stay here.] When she finished speaking, she pursed her lips and laughed at herself.</p>
<p>When Packard saw her smile, he became suspicious and asked angrily, [What do you mean by that?] Kitty laughed wildly and said, [You think I'm going to stay home all day looking at this bracelet? Haha, you big fool! You thought that while you were figuring out other people's money, I was quietly waiting at home for Dad to come back?] Packard said, [You... you... what is this?] Kitty deliberately teased him and said, [You don't like it? You have to calculate other people's money, won't people calculate your daughter-in-law?] Packard's eyes flashed with fire and said, [Who? Tell me!] Kitty slowly dabbed powder on her nose and said coldly, [Don't you know Packard?] Kitty teased him like this, making him furious. He called Tina in and asked her who had been here. But Tina was looking at the diamond bracelet on her mistress's wrist, thinking that she would definitely be able to get it this time. She helped her mistress, arguing that no other man had been here.</p>
<p>Packard couldn't get any clear information, so he sent Tina away. He panted and said to Kitty, [I can divorce you and kick you out, and not give you a penny!] Kitty laughed and said, [Why would you divorce me, what evidence do you have?] Packard said, [I can find evidence, I can hire some detectives to follow you. I can kill him. I can throw you out.] Kitty still didn't care and said, [Okay. You throw me out. But you have to think twice before you throw me out. I don't need to hire detectives for your affairs, I know a lot!] Packard said, [What do you know?] Kitty said, [What do I know? Aren't you going to Washington? Aren't you going to enter politics and become a great man? Well, I also understand politics. I know all about your corrupt and fraudulent dealings. Although I didn't want to listen, I heard it all. So that kind of despicable and sordid means, dirty and trampling behavior, is called politics. Haha, let me announce these politics, and see if you politicians still talk about politics!] When she finished speaking, she laughed incessantly.</p>
<p>Packard paced back and forth with his head down, gritting his teeth and cursing, [You are as venomous as a snake! I almost pulled you out of the gutter, is this how you repay me! Our relationship is cut off! I'm going to Jordan with you today because Fen克力夫 is there. Starting tomorrow, we're breaking up!] Kitty said, [No, it's still early. I can make you do whatever I want now, and you wouldn't dare say half a no. First thing...] Her voice suddenly trembled, and she said a great principle. (To be continued)</p>
