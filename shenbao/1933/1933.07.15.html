<h3>多倫收復後之問題</h3>
<p>馮玉祥報告抗日同盟軍收復多倫之通電。實喜峯口血戰後最足興奮人心之新聞資料也。近月以來。華北傳來之消息均足國人增其對於。國事失望之程度。馮氏張垣樹幟所引起之所謂察哈爾問題以對外之活動反成爲醖釀國內重大糾紛之禍根尤憂時之士所痛心疾首者今馮氏通電。報告</p>
<p>收復多倫。即集中精力於解决察事之北平當局亦認其事爲差强人意。而以爲一般想像中之戰禍大可放心則國人鬰問之氣。其亦可以稍舒乎雖然就目前內外情勢而加以觀察。多倫之收復。只可認爲察事轉變形勢之關鍵國人若遽以完全樂觀之心理對之。則將來形勢轉變之或未能盡如人意必將失望益甚矣。</p>
<p>多倫收復後之形勢。可就三方面言之㈠就日軍對察省之態度言。抗日同盟軍此次自取得沽源寳昌康保以至入多倫。似未遇日軍嚴重之對抗此與日軍對察整個計劃有關非其不堪應戰至於如此也。今後日軍。其將放棄察省以僅據遼吉黑熟爲足乎。則多倫地尙屬察。倘馮軍不更進而攻熱。日軍亦不至向多倫反攻。其將如從前之一種傳説以佔領張家口爲目的乎則其集中熱邊之衆必急反攻多倫。乘勢西侵。以完成其豫定之計劃。此關係敵方之根本計劃。未可從表面以觀察者也。㈡就解决察局之國內問題言。平張兩方。今已在四項步驟之下。成箭在弦上之勢。所謂四項步驟以「結束抗日軍事「居首。「撤銷同盟軍名義」次之。其餘宋回察與請馮就林墾督辦。不過附带之關係耳。吾人今日所欲知者。日來宣化懐來間之緊張形勢其以多倫之收復而加甚乎。抑以此而得寛缓乎。萬一龐炳勳之軍。接孫殿英部防地後而更前進馮氏其以多倫已復。有地可退。而和平讓出宣張各地乎。抑將以槍口內外並對乎。此關於雙方决心之問題也。㈢就抗日同盟軍自身馮玉祥關於北平當局之提議。曾對人表示。一待將多倫收復後一切均不成問題「北平當局。則希望」如多倫收復保察之目的已逹。馮氏可結束一切今多倫實行收復一切均不成問題乎。馮氏可結束一切乎此尤爲重大之問題也吾人試回憧九一八事變後足以興奮人心之各事件大都在事件發展之時。報紙消息傅布。讓報者多感興奮少覺悲觀此次抗日同盟軍之收復多倫就事實言收復失地至二百餘公里宜可以震驚一　時矣然今日國人心理與十九路軍上海抗日時如何與宋哲元喜峯口血戰時如何此亦問題外之問題也。</p>

<p>注意之點、厥爲美代表畢特門之銀議案、及法國主張於國內資金不敷時利用外資舉辦公共工程之議案、畢特門向銀股員會建議恢復銀價之方法、爲㈠用銀幣以代低值之紙幣、㈡恢復硬幣成色、至少爲八百至一千、㈢不另徵收進口銀税、㈣酌視情形、廢除或减輕進口銀税、㈤一九三八年一月一日以前不得以過剩白銀充斥於市塲、畢特門前於大會初開會時、曾提出關於白銀之議案、現收回前議而以此次提案代替之、畢特門請與會各國依允上述辦法、</p>
<p>法國所提關於公共工程之議案、爲國際勞工局主席及其他重要會員所贊同、但英商相任錫曼對於此議、毅然反對、謂英國近來對於公共工程費去資金一萬萬鎊以救濟失業、此數認爲過分浩大、不堪再爲之、如他國决定作此嘗試、英國不願干涉之、惟英國未便再參加關於公共工程的國際政策之討論、亦不願與聞籌集欵項、以供他國行此政策云、</p>
<p>中代表郭泰祺繼起發言述中國情形、謂中國有良好生利事業之機會、中國之政策、在以適當公共工程如運輸事業等、發展國家、其程序與目的、僅爲財力所限、中國亟欲提高生活程度、並擴大有技術的工作之範圍、解决經濟恐慌最大潛能之一、即伏於目前提案中之、世界中不乏亟需發展程序、而無外助自已無力舉辦之國、中國即其一也、此爲大會最宜予以直接注意之一點云、此案辯論後、主席柯里恩决計以無期延缓此案行動之形式、將法國議案提交主幹部審議、（十三日路</p>

<h3>漢奸郝鵬恢復自由</h3>
<p>駐津日領向于抗議　　外交空氮非常惡劣</p>
<p>地緯路忽臨時戒嚴</p>
<p>汽車載郝入日租界</p>
<p>天津特訊、漢奸郝鵬、於本月六日黎明時、被其部下苑某李某用汽車架送第一軍團部後、人心大快、一般人逆料不梟首亦必槍斃、最低限度亦當與松滬漢奸胡立夫之絞决、留個全屍而已、孰知事有大謬不然出人意料这外者、蓋郝已居然恢復自由矣、茲紀經過情形如次</p>
<p>郝鵬被其部下所賣身入囹圄、已知罪大惡極、國法難容、遂四處托人關説、希望保全活命、辦個無期徒刑、一面則在軍法處供辭、異常狡展、略謂渠之組織、絶對不是賣國乃係反對不抵抗、不滿意現在政治擬利用外人力量、改良政治保全國土因所住在日租界、耳目蔽塞、無異裝在葫蘆裏、被人玩弄而不自知、且有許多人、都説華北軍隊運動成熟的已逹二十萬人、祇要信砲一響即四方響應、化去的運動費着實不少、心想日本人不是傻子、他能捨得如此化錢、自有把握、又言在日租界招募便衣隊二千人、五月十九日發給槍械、以手溜彈爲最多、首先放第一個手溜彈的給一百元、以次則每日給五十元、那天晚上派出去的便衣隊不過二三百人、回來的祇剩幾十人、其餘的人大槪將手溜彈抛在一　旁、夤夜逃走了、軍隊無一人響應、此時纔知道若輩不可靠、但勢成騎虎、如箭在弦、於是又繼續的幹了幾夜、依然失敗、至於對於于主席之勤廉正直、非常欽佩、始終愛戴、有人謀剌于主席、他一槪不知云云</p>
<p>郝鵬被收押後、即有不少失意政客、爲之奔走求情、其入軍法處係在七月六日上午十時、駐津日領事田中、曾至省政府見于主席、妄然抗議越界捕人、于云道是他的部下倒戈、送來領賞、他是中央通緝的要犯、我自然收留、已致電中央請示辦法、田中謂、此事暫且不必分辯、容俟偵查後再説、在未偵查明白以前、萬勿將郝處置、以免死無對證、于告以决不擅自處置、田中又要求晤郝一談、于婉辭謝絶、次日下午三時、日租界憲兵隊長（兼駐屯軍司令部參謀、）森木少佐、全身武裝、乘汽車到省政府、先請謁見于主席、繼欲與郝鵬晤面、適于因公外出、無人負責、森木悻而去、自第三日起、爲郝氏斡旋之人更多、而其時故都方面、已經日方辦妥、于氏受環境所迫、無可如何、遂定三項辦法㈠解往北平發落㈡交法院裁判、㈢由軍法處判無期徒刑、但此三項辦法、北平方面、均不贊成、而外交上之空氣、又非常惡劣、謂不將郝釋放、接收戰區即要發生阻碍、於是權衡重輕、祇得縱囚、並取銷通緝令以完成公事上之手續、十日晚間、日租界方面催請釋放之電話、連續不斷、延至十一日上午三時、河北地緯路大經路大胡同東馬路臨時戒備、在此戒嚴之一刹那間、即有幾輛汽車馳入日租界、斷以一片鼓掌歡呼之聲、而郝鵬遂告恢復自由矣（十二日草夫）</p>

<h3>沿江長途飛行曾詒經氏昨晨返滬</h3>
<p>談此行增加不少經騐</p>
<p>航空救國須敎練人才</p>
<p>江鳳機桴略損己運滬</p>
<p>日日社云、海軍製造飛機處長曾詒經氏、於前月十五日同德人機師蒲里、乘自製水上敎練機江鳳號、由滬出發、作沿江長途飛行、到逹岳州後、因桴輪小有損壞、返漢修理、裝運建國輪返滬、曾氏亦乘該輪東下、已於昨晨十一時抵埠、日日社記者昨特往曾氏於該處、承談如下、</p>
<h3>飛航經過</h3>
<p>據據曾氏談、余爲提倡自</p>
<p>製飛機喚醒同胞、特於前</p>
<p>月中旬、駕江鳳號機、作</p>
<p>沿江長途飛航、此次飛航經過、并不困難抵鎭江時、飛機桴輪略有損壞、即電召工匠、由滬前往修理、旋即繼續飛行、經南京蕪湖安慶九江武穴諸地、於廿日抵漢、因長江水流甚急、毎小時速度逹五英里、機桴啣接之處、又告損壞、即吊懸威勝砲艦上、從事修理、費時三四日、二十九日飛往岳州、本擬再飛長沙、直逹沙市宜昌、以上江江流較漢口速度增加兩英里、不得已於本月六日飛返漢口、惟飛機尙右勉强飛行而德機師爲愼重起見、不再東飛、將機拆散、裝運建國輪返滬</p>

<h3>交流機的交流聲</h3>
<p>— 襄</p>
<p>交流收音機，最大的缺點，就是容易發生營營的交流聲（Ｈｕｍ）此種交流聲雖不能完全免除，若設計得法，亦可减至極小，不致妨碍收音。</p>
<p>來源一·由於電力供給部分，如濾波電容器電容量不足，漏電，或濾波扼制圈太小等·</p>
<p>二·由於擴聲器，因普通交流機的動力式擴聲器（ＤｙｍａｍｉｃＳｐｅａｋｅｒ俗稱電喇叭），其磁塲綫圈（ＦｉｅｌｄＣｏｉｌ）都借用濾波扼制圈，所以整流後的跳動直流電流經過時，常會感應到發言綫圈（ＶｏｉｃｅＣｏｉｌ）裏，成强大的交流聲。</p>
<p>三·由於其他雜亂的靜電塲和磁和磁電塲的感應。</p>
<p>四·有時由於電燈火綫將訊號電壓引至整流管，與其輸出的電壓成調幅作用，發射至收音機各處綫路，而成交流聲。</p>
<p>五·有時因環繞極或陰極的交流磁塲，有控制屏流的效能，所以亦能發生小量的交流聲。</p>
<p>六·傍熱式眞空管，陰極（Ｃａｔｈｏｄ）和傍熱極（Ｈｅａｔｅｒ）間的電壓過高，中間發生漏電現象。</p>
<h3>檢查法</h3>
<p>要免除交流聲，必先查明其來源，檢查步驟，可將每級的輸入和輸出綫路，順次接成短路，以鑒别這交流聲發生在那一級，若最後低週率放大級的輸入路成短路時，交流聲仍不能免除，那麽障碍大約在電力供給部分，若輸出變壓器或擴聲器的發音圈成短路後，交流聲仍繼續存在，可斷爲由於第二種的來源。至于免除方法容在</p>
<p>下期再述。</p>
<h3>談談擴聲器續</h3>
<p>— 一知</p>
<p>（三）平衡膜擴聲器（Ｂａｌａｎｃｅｄｄｉｈｒａｍｌｏｕｄｓｐｅａｋｒ）這擴聲器，係由雙極式及平衡銜式合併而成的·亦可説由兩個雙極式製成的。牠的简單構造原理如圖四·ＭＭ爲磁石，Ｃ爲音流圈，Ｄ爲振膜，其放聲原理與平衡式同。牠的特點㈠平衡膜常保持其平衡位置，故來回振幅常等（二）因有小磁石經過一部分磁流，磁性不易失却。（三）磁塲不易飽和，負載電流可加大。（四）不會起倍週波率雜音。牠的用</p>
<p>途：與平衡銜式的相若，不過此式於製造上較平衡銜稍難價格亦稍貴故不如平衡銜式比較用得普</p>
<p>（二）活動線　聲器（Ｍｏｖｉｎｇｃｏｉｌｌｏｕｄｓｐｅａｋｏｒ）</p>
<p>活動線圈式擴聲器構造原理和固定式的稍異，牠依照電動機（Ｍｏｔｏｒ）的原理構造。當活動線圈負載音波電流時，線圈間遂發生一磁塲，乃與母磁塲（該磁塲用激圈導入電流，使成强力的電磁塲）發生吸力的變化，一推一拉，往復振動，激動振膜變成音浪。這擴聲器有一特點，即磁塲不用永久磁石。但因爲這種擴聲器，要推動活動線圈的很大振膜，故必需强大的磁塲。永久磁石的磁塲强度以同様大小而言，總較電磁石的爲低弱。牠的構造如圖五：Ｅ爲磁鐵，Ｃ爲激勵圈，Ｍ爲活動圈，Ｄ爲空心一五圖圓錐形振膜·當外來音波電流輸入活動線圈時，與母磁塲發生吸力的變化，推動振膜，放出聲音，這種擴聲器的優點（一）振膜不受空氣隙的限制，故可將振膜振幅擴大，（二）不像固定線圈式的須有一定彈性，以維持其工作的穩定。（三）活動線圈的電流與推動此線圈的電流完全成正比例·（四）因磁線不經過振膜，不致發生飽和現象。這是牠的幾點優處，但也有數個缺點：（一）母磁塲需要强大磁力，故所需磁鐵面積較大而重量加增·（二）需直流電以激勵磁力故多耗電力·（三）構造頗難，價格較固定式者爲貴·這種擴聲器，用於强力的收音機上，或擴大機上，以供數十人或數百數千人聽是最適宜的，現大在市上的交流機和影戲院裏的擴大機，皆用此種方式。（未完）</p>
<h3>變壓器復活法</h3>
<p>— 知</p>
<p>變壓器最容易損壞，（其原因不外二端；一因負載電流過大而將線燒斷，一因潮氣侵入而將線　斷，壞了以後，調換新線圈，其價幾與購一新的相若；若拆開重繞，手續旣繁，非有經騐者所不能辦。所以變壓器損壞，往往廢去而購買新的。但現在有一個簡便修理方法，能將已壞的變壓器即刻還原過來，猶如眞空管的施行復活法一般。其方法如下；</p>
<p>將損壞變壓器（專指成音週率變壓器Ａｕｄｉｏｔｒａｎｓｆｏｒｍｅｒ而言）。已斷綫的二極（大都爲Ｐ極與Ｂ極）直接於二百二十弗打的電壓上，約經二三秒鐘後，即能將斷綫自然　接而復活。如若不能，再繼續這様的試騐一次；倘又不能，則再繼續一次，而將時間稍延長。若經過這様三次試騐後，該變壓器仍不能復活，則因該變壓器的斷處的距離過大，無法使其復活，祇有拆開重繞了。</p>
<p>爲什麽斷綫的變壓器接上二百二十弗打的電壓後，能將斷綫自然焊牢呢？這是應用電弧焊（Ｅｌｅｃｔｒｉ究ｃａｒｃＷｅｌｄｉｄｇ）的原理。欲加深究，請參看任何電學書籍的電焊法。</p>
<p>作者曾有變壓器二只，其正圈一被燒斷，一爲霉斷，皆曾施用此法而得復活。迄今已用四月餘，未見損壞。有損壤的變壓器者不妨試騐一下。</p>
<h3>小經騐</h3>
<p>— 柯榮炎</p>
<p>（一）細漆包鋼絲上的漆，刮去很難，可以拿綫在洒精燈上把漆燒去。</p>
<p>（二）牙膏管的錫片，是做固定電容器的良好材料；錫蓋又是一個優良的礦石杯。</p>
<p>（三）硬紙版用洋燭油浸透，漆以油漆，就是一塊絕綠優良的膠板；破舊的留聲機唱片也可同様利用。</p>
<p>（四）膠管式綫圈的兩端，可以連接兩隻接綫柱，裝卸時可以便利不少。</p>
<p>（五）兩塊蛛網式綫圈板，用一隻螺絲釘連起來，中間夾一個舊熱水瓶襄的彈簧，就是一付三回路線圈架。及時可以把初級和次級綫圈繞在第一塊板上，再生圈繞在第二塊板上，旋轉螺絲釘上的螺絲帽，可以很精細的調節再生力。</p>
<p>（六）破的賽琉璐烟盒肥皂盒等，可以剪成小片繞阻力綫等當作絕綠體用。</p>
<h3>自製緩旋度盤</h3>
<p>— 李元慶</p>
<p>選擇性良好的收音機，調節時祇要有毫厘之差，便不能得到聲音。要想得到調節的準確與便利，便不能不用緩旋度盤。</p>
<p>本篇所介紹的緩旋度盤，構造很簡單，但使用亦非常便利。先將接線螺柱的膠木頂子，用力旋緊，使不易滑出。再將橡皮管一小段，套在膠木頂子上。又在膠板上鑽一小孔，將接線螺柱插入，套上彈簧後，用螺帽絲二個夾緊。（如圖）因爲橡皮管具有伸縮性，所以轉動時便能潤滑自如。</p>
<h3>利用鬧鐘做成的計時開關</h3>
<p>— 李慶</p>
<p>有許多玩弄無線電的朋友們，因爲着迷太深的綠故，即使睡在牀上，還是不肯丢下聽筒。但是一不經意，便要睡去，結果不但電池無謂消耗，就是收音機因爲經過長時間的開放，也要容易損壞的。要想避免此種損失，便不能不裝一個計時開關。</p>

<h3>常識</h3>
<p>— 黃鑑村</p>
<p>（十）接收用天地綫（一）天綫一語，英文稱Ａｎｔｅｎｎａ其意本應解爲昆蟲之觸角。因天綫是用導體高懸在空間來吸收電波的，其功用頗似昆蟲之觸角（俗稱蟲鬚），所以時人就把觸角Ａｎｔｅｎａ之　名來當做天綫的名稱了。</p>
<p>地綫是用金屬體埋入地中來完成天綫的電路，使接收電流得在電路中振盪，而成爲收音機之原動力。</p>
<p>因此天地綫之優劣，與收音的效率有極大的影響。尤其是礦石收音機，不像眞空管收音機有放大作用，祇能利用在天綫所發生的電流直接來做原動力。</p>
<p>所以天地綫之優劣，尤不得不講究。</p>
<p>（一）天綫的形狀：天綫之形狀雖多，但普通用以接收播音者共有下述數種（Ａ）倒Ｌ式天綫：如第一圖所示之天綫，係在兩兩竹竿之間高架水平線，兩端各繫以磁製或玻璃製之絕緣體，而在其一端接一引入綫（Ｌｅａｄｉｎｗｉｒｅ）導至屋內之收音機，其形頗似英文Ｌ倒寫而成，因稱之曰倒Ｌ式天綫。第四圖</p>
<p>（Ｂ）Ｔ式天綫：如第二圖所不之天綫，係在水平綫之中央裝接引入綫者，其形頗似英文Ｔ字。</p>
<p>（Ｃ）傾斜式天綫：如第三圖所示，以導體傾斜裝架於一木柱者。</p>
<p>第三圖收音机</p>
<p>（Ｄ）綫圈天綫·如第四圖所示之天綫，係以導體絕綠綫約百尺圈繞製成正方形者，其指向性甚佳，凡靈敏度優秀之高級收音機多用之。</p>
<p>在圖籍上，天綫的符號，不論其形狀如何，常以</p>
<p>第二圖收音机</p>
<p>或表之，但在綫圈天綫，其符號則爲第一圖收音机</p>
<p>（二）天綫的高度·天綫之之架設愈高，則其所感受之電壓愈增，而收音機之靈敏度（Ｓｅｎｓｉｔｉｖｉｔｉｔｙ）亦大增，然天綫愈高，則其處理之方法愈不容易。大抵用以接收播音者，其高度約自七至十米突，其水平部分之長約與高度相同或其二倍之數較爲適用。</p>
<p>（三）天綫之位置：如天綫之附近有電燈電力綫或電報電話綫時，天綫必受影響而使收音機之靈敏度低下，故天綫務必離開電力綫等三米突以上，其對於高壓綫至少須離開六米突以上。</p>
<p>難問題，皆可解决。並於一年內如有損壞者，可免費重修。服務堪稱週到。爲市上首屈一指者。</p>

<h3>守墓孝子</h3>
<p>— 赡廬</p>
<p>名詞，有時代的關係；古代的好名詞，到了現在，會得變成了惡濁名詞。古代的性書，要正襟端坐而　；現代的性書，變成了導淫之媒。古代的聖人，是尊而無上的名號；現代的聖人，變成了玩笑的稱呼。最近河南地方，又發生了許多守墓的孝子，用舊眼光看來差不多廬墓三年的制度，於今復活，大可擴充二十四孝而成爲二十五孝了。假使，左邱明重生斯世，一定唱着他的讚美論調道：「詩云；「孝子不匱永錫爾類，」其是之謂乎？」</p>
<p>但是，一經調查守墓孝子的眞相，唉！’他們十七代的祖宗，眞正大不幸而會得有這守墓孝子咧！原來，河南安陽，號稱古代的殷壚，自從中央研究院一度發掘以後，近來發掘的工作，絡繹不絕。五色斑斕的古器，一經出現，便有許多如蠅附　的骨董鬼跟踪而來。俗稱掘祖　是掘人家的祖墳，現在安陽人的掘祖墳，是掘自己的祖墳；倘使，開掘的時候，没人監視，便不免被役矣們從中吞没，所以子孫掘祖墳，當做一　奇貨可居的營業，須得地主在旁監視開掘，各役夫對於此種監視的地主，都喚作守墓孝子。於是，安陽地方的墳墓，陡然增添了許多不避箱雪不憚風雨的守墓孝子，孝哉安陽人！孝哉安陽人！有了這守墓孝子，好好的一個孝字，又被後人弄壞了。從前「非孝派」説的：「萬惡孝爲首」，這五個字，實在是過火語；但把來移贈安陽的守墓孝子，却是銖兩悉稱，一些兒不覺過火。</p>
<h3>日本人之搜求</h3>
<p>— 思素</p>
<p>日本人搜藏中華古董，由來已久中華的許多有關文化的古物，陸續渡海而東，藏在日本官中及其民間眞不知多少。到現在大約是因貴重的古物，已搜藏得差不多，漸漸地搜無可搜，便不得不將搜的範圍擴大，不限於古，兼及於今，不限於奇珍異寳，兼及於牛溲馬渤，凡是中華不大有的東西，都在搜之列。自古代傳留下來的古物，到底有限，日本搜去一様，中華就少了一様，古物不能誕育古物，仿造的又是　鼎，不是古物，旣被日本人想盡方法，或秘密買收，或恃强强迫買收，如前年買收某氏家藏秦漢磚瓦及某地石佛之類；又或出以軍事的佔有，如東北四省所有的古物，都成爲俘虜之類；瀋陽有故宮，熱河有行宮，這裏面的古物，更特别豐富，日本人搜得最痛快。最滿足。可是日本人越搜得多，中華便越形缺乏，像是一盞燈盡了油似的，再搜到那裏還搜得出來呢？我們知道日本文庫裏藏有好幾部中華孤本，中華人著的書，中華人看不到，反而流入日本文庫，這在日本人是麽得意，中華人是多麽懊喪丨但，所謂孤本也終於不過好幾部而已，此外中華人若也有藏着的，就不是孤本，不足珍貴了；倘仍限於古物，自將勞而無功，聰明的日本人，於是把搜的範圍擴大了。</p>
<p>擴大是由前年九月十八日開始的，試看：自九一八開始搜藏在長春的中華希有之物，是多麽豐富，如鄭孝胥之類，在偌大的中華，能找得出幾個呢？以希爲貴，日本人開始擴大範圍後，搜起來全以『希有』爲條件，凡是在中華希有的東西，都看得像古物一様珍貴，不管中華人認爲臭腐，他都一律視作神奇，喜孜孜地搜求不已，所以今年連地痞也寳愛起來了。看將來還不知有什麽東西被搜去呢！</p>
<h3>漫話漫畫</h3>
<p>— （錢澐作文　棟良作畫）</p>
<p>大上海？</p>
<p>上海馬路上近來爲什麽人這般擠？是給臭虫趕出來的丨大半。一幢房屋每每住了十多家，人們住在裏面，乾脆的説：像饅首在蒸籠裏，火般地煮，冷天尙好，到了熱天就</p>
<p>要命；於是吃　露天，睡在露天時竟出恭都墨露天，露天是他們蒸籠裏人的世界，世界才是他們的空，睡的是地，蓋的是天，偉大呀！</p>
<p>Ｓｈａｏｇｈａｉ眞是了不得的所在，（所以寫英文者，據説這様的語音才喊得響亮，這裏要表示他的了不得，且借一用，）不然爲什麽各地的人源源而來，有時竟把一部份人擠到了黃浦江中，實在非但住的房屋擠滿了，卽如飯食也給人得不到一些；可惜一般人還不大相信這話，以爲偌大一個上海。</p>
<h3>神女生涯</h3>
<p>— 丙丁</p>
<p>昔人詩道：『莫道人世鴛鴦侶，我當哀鴻一例看。』這是古人感嘆妓女而作。在下嘗發獃想，以爲好好一個女子，何以甘心願作妓女。爲着貧苦嗎？女子的職業多得很，也何必操這種皮肉生涯。爲貪圖舒服嗎？披星戴月，懸　侍人，也未嘗是精神恬適。然而樂此不疲，情情願願度這種『非人生活，』眞令人百思不解Ｖ</p>
<p>不是我抹煞目今的妓女，以爲品性好的也有，美麗也未必遜於古人。可是後前的妓女，往往品貌以外，還了技能，詩啦，畫啦，音律啦，都很有了根底。現在呢，唱幾齣皮簧，跳跳舞，打情駡俏，坐汽車兜風，吃大菜，這幾件本領吧了。一開口，多數是流氓化，拆白化，也許皮毛的歐化，繡花枕頭，在下委實不敢恭維。</p>
<p>宋朝時候，梁紅玉能識韓世忠，帮着丈夫打敗金人。蘇東坡在杭州的時候，妓女周韶，做了首詩，請求脱籍道：『梁上巢空歲月驚，認看回首自梳翖，開籠若放雪衣女，長念觀音般若經。』</p>
<p>李師師能顚倒道君，未必全在於貌，想必其技高人一等。明季士夫，恣情聲色，固然是亡國的現象；然而這班陳圓圓，柳如是，董小宛，李香君，也必有許多特長，能夠做了亡國的妖孽。現在的妓女，恐怕還談不到。譬如大名鼎鼎的賽金花，曉得詩嗎？畫嗎？不過浪漫吧了。自鄶以下，眞找不出一個明季的歌妓。譬如，有人要撰現代的『名妓列傳，』其難和撰現代的『循吏傳』一般無二問花尋柳，走馬章臺，是雅事，不是俗事。因爲性的慰藉，足以調劑枯寂的人生；所以一個人不及於亂的逛窰子，也不可説是壞事。不過從目下的情形來講，不是在頭腦冬烘，敢説『舉世皆濁，』那裏談得到『雅』字。至於其他山肉的賣買塲所，委實是發洩獸性的表現，我把『哀鴻』稱伊，也是子與氏的惻隱之心啊！</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第十一回　俯首許婚姻芳情脈脈　關心到士卒喜氣洋洋李長發楞住了一會，垂着的手，抽了兩抽，慢吞吞的道他是俺爺爺。趙自强一跳脚道：田連長，你瞧，這小子該揍不該揍？祖父是他爺爺，他眞聰明，他眞聰明，他會知道。田連長實在没法振作尙武精神，也是哈哈一笑。趙自强道：你祖父是你爺爺，我不知道嗎？我問你爺爺呌什麽名字。他恍然大悟了，</p>
<p>哦了一聲道：排長给他取了個名字，呌李有道。趙自强搖搖頭道：你眞會把我氣死。不用説了，下去好好的背熟來罷。他退下去了。他後面站着一個瘦小的黑漢子，尖尖的臉眼珠直轉，這分明是比較精靈些的様子。趙自强道：你呌什麽？他搶了道：我呌阮得明，河南新鄕人，年十六歲，二十一年一月入伍，保人皮克蘍，祖父阮守道，父阮大海，左五斗，右三斗。田靑笑道：核桃拌豆腐，一哆囉一塊，這小子倒背了一個滾瓜爛熟。可是你忙什麼？剛問你呌什麼，你就報上來了。趙自強平伸著兩手，連連搖了幾下，歎著氣道：我連裏過到這麼幾蘑菇，呌我怎麼辦？下去罷。那個兵倒納悶，自己說的前後顚倒了呢！還是錯了呢？只好垂頭喪氣的走了。田青笑道：你交給班長排長得了你急什麼？趙自強道國：有了檢閱的消息好多天了，知道總司令那一天來？我若是不管，到了那個日子出了亂子，是誰的責任。田青笑道：先別管這個，咱們談一談私事罷。說著就在身上掏出那封信來，雙手遞給趙自強，順勢作了一個揖，連說恭喜恭喜。趙自強笑道：別開味了，我氣得要死，你倒恭喜我。田青道：眞的，我應當恭喜你，那婚事成功了。不信你瞧這封信。趙自強將信接到手上看了一遍，不覺抬起手來，搔了一陣頭髪道：這……這……你們尋未婚夫人，不至於和我開玩物吧？（一三○）</p>

<h3>敎科書大傾銷</h3>
<p>— 珠</p>
<p>年年只見「傳布文化」的書籍漲價。先是原來照定價八折的，改售實價了；隨後實價又漲上一成二成了；原因都是成本昂貴，開支浩大．不料本年夏初，忽然看見幾家大書坊煌煌然登出大幅的廣告來，敎科書大廉價：中學敎科書原售實價者减賣八折，小學敎科書原售八折者减售六折了！敎科書是學生的必需品，二成的折扣雖然爲數不多，可是窮學生們實已受惠不淺了．在這一點上，誰也應該歡迎敎科書的大减價中小敎科書的編印，在四五年前只有商務中華世界等三大書局；他們三家『三分』了中國的『敎育世界．』他們各有『勢力範圍，』雖然『分治，』却也『合作』。編印中小敎科書必須大資本，而且推銷敎科書據説也必須有『線索；』眞所謂茲事體大，普通的書店决不敢冒昧從事的。而况「天下」旣已定於「三，」别家想打出一條路來更不容易。但是最近三四年來，各書店因爲營業上很少「出路，」便也冒險來幹敎科書，迄今已編成中學敎科書的，就有開明，神州，北新，大東等數家。但是敎科書的「基本地盤」據説不在「中」而在「小。」於是小學敎科書的編印也就新增了兩家；開明和大東。現在就有五種小學敎科書擺在小學敎師的面前聽憑他們選擇採用。而敎科書大减價也就因此發生了。照普通習惯講，如果一條街上新開一家布店减價，則同街的老牌布店勢必也要大减價。書店雖説是「爲文化服務，」却也難逃這營業競爭的鐵則。在這競爭中，資本薄弱手腕不靈的舖子，難免要喫虧。這又是商業上的鐵則。然而敎科書倒底有關文化，不能和普通商品相提並論；平常人買一尺布也要比較好歹，現在旣是有關於兒童敎育的特種「商品，」自然更應該比較比較這選擇之權，自然操於小學敎師。可是研究小學敎育的先生們也應該乘這大傾銷的當兒對各家的書籍來一個公正的批評，給小學敎師們做取舍的參考。必如此，然後减售六折的敎科書大傾銷不至於成爲單純的商業競爭，然後可以説一句眞正對於兒童有利益了。</p>
<p>總之，凡事有了競爭然後有進步，但粗製濫造的出品也往往因競爭而愈恟；因此，不存私心的嚴正的批評愈加成爲必要！</p>
<h3>根兒</h3>
<p>— 埜容</p>
<p>根兒把自己的衣裳包札了幾件，眼涙</p>
<p>汪汪的指點著床上的一堆破衣，告訴我</p>
<p>；這是爹的，這是小四的，都縫補好了。自家還留下幾件衣，明兒給小四改一改還好穿。此時眼涙就像斷了線的珠，從她臉上雨一般的落下來。</p>
<p>我嘆了一口氣，想安慰她幾句，但我説什麽好呢？我説什麽好呢？我如今是把自己親生女兒當破衣一様賣了出去。我的喉頭像給什麽塞住了似的，透不過氣來。我的雙眼朦上了一層薄明的涙水。根兒把她的眼涙揩了一把，又來來往往的收拾東西去了。似乎想把家裏的東西様様都打點好，使我永不操心；又好像一一向她們告别。</p>
<p>我好像痴了似的，坐著發呆，心裏不想什麽，口裏也不説什麽。我的心完全停滞了。</p>
<p>自從她娘死了以後，接接連連這幾年的大水和兵慌，田裏收不起東西，一家人都弄得精疲力盡，天天在饑餓中打滾；然而光景竟一天天落下去，如今就不能不賣了我這又温順又懂事的女兒來還僨了。天啊，這是什麽世界？</p>
<p>我爲什麽竟一時糊塗，八十元就把她賣了？她可是我的女兒，我親生的肉啊。</p>
<p>然而這事如今要翻悔也遲了，我不是先收了他們拾塊定洋了麽？…</p>
<p>我不禁想起她平日的好處來。這幾年苦日子，要没有她，怎能熬到現在。她給我管理家務，招扶兄弟，有時還得受我的窮氣。可憐一個十六歲還不到的姑娘，竟把她娘遺下來的苦頭，一手接受了。她要這兒那兒去自己尋東西來吃，尋東西來喂養兄弟，她要流著涙挺身出來，代我去聽那些收債人的辱駡，向他們説好話，她還要…她跟我做了十幾年女兒，竟一天好日也没有度過，如今更要來賣她償債。！我賣了她，失了她以後的日子，怎能再過得下去？</p>
<p>小四赤著身體從外面跑進來，滿身灰土。根兒拉著她揚了一揚手，隨又放下。她説，</p>
<p>「小四，來洗」洗罷，回頭我去了，誰還替你洗？「她隨即舀了一盆水，把他抱到盆中開始洗起來。</p>
<p>小四問道；」你到什麽地方去？阿姐带我去好不好？一</p>
<p>根兒低著頭，很久纔答應他：出去拾泥豆，他用不着去。後來她低聲告訴他，呌他不要亂跑，要他聽爹的話，不要跟前面王阿桂到泥坑裏去洗澡。</p>
<p>她給小四洗好了以後，拿出短衫來給他穿上，便牽着他向廚下去了。我看着她的背影不禁心痛起來。我舉起手來在胸口捶了幾下，我希望我的身子爆炸起來，並把整個世界炸毁。…</p>
<p>根兒把午飯燒好，吃了，收拾了盌筷，遲疑一會，問我道：</p>
<p>「爹，我要走了嗎？周大爺不是説吃了飯，爹領我去？…」她輕輕的説着，但并没有哭聲。她的聲音，就好像一把尖刀，一個字在我心裏割一下。我怎能讓她走？我怎様親自領著她，領著我的根兒去交給人家？我沉默了一會，説道：</p>
<p>「不要去了罷。根兒，你不要走了。」聲音就好像從我的心裏噴出。她凝著兩眼望著我，不響。隨後我看見眼涙又如斷珠般從她臉上落下來。她捧住臉嗚咽起來。</p>
<p>周寳先忽然在門口立住，説道，「走啊，天不早了。我不是説今天還得趕車？」</p>
<h3>一部「剪影集」的世界文學史</h3>
<p>— 殘月</p>
<p>近來看完了歐洲文學發逹史和二十世紀的歐洲藝術，對於文學史頗感到興趣，剛好樂華書局的國貨世界文學史上中册在大登廣告，四號字齊齊整整排開，「好評一束」裏，所謂名流學者們連聲呌好（是否摘錄來信不得而知），於是買了一本回來，想看看這位中國辛克萊信徒余慕陶的高妙唯物研究方法。</p>
<p>翻開第一頁一篇叙言裏，劈頭就是「這是一句「偉人」的説話！」先就把我嚇得渾身冷汗，所謂偉人者，不知是誰，因爲「偉人」之類實在太多了。祇有令人心跳。接着作者感慨系之的説一番對於中國出版界認爲不滿的話，原因是「關於文學史的著譯，比較像様的著作簡直没有。」於是他便把這本「像様」的世界文學史貢獻出來。</p>
<p>原來本書是依着兩句「名言」寫的。又使我吃了一驚：「名言」爲何？曰：</p>
<p>『文學是社會生活的反影，』</p>
<p>」有了十月革命才有俄國現代文學。』</p>
<p>作者對於這兩句所謂『名言』這様斬釘截鐵的膜拜着，我起初直疑心是民國十四五年寫的舊稿，忙去翻看日期，却正是『九月二十三日，一九三二年』寫的。</p>
<p>但旣引「偉人，」復據「名言」，鳥可不卒　。便窮一日之力把它看完。掩卷欲寐，忽有所悟。取趙景深的中國文學小史，鄭振鐸的文學大綱，拉狄克的中國革命運動史細加對勘，發現余先生的「唯物研究」的「像様」大著的方法是，　　中國革命運動史十中國文學小史十文學大綱十中國社會史的論戰（古董雜貨攤）第一二輯。！，剪影集的世界文</p>
<p>學史。</p>
<p>謂予不信，拉狄克雖份屬鬼子，無　由指證，鄭振鐸遠在北平，不便相訽，但趙景深老哥，假如看過這一本「像様」的大作的話，總可心照吧。</p>
<p>鄭振鐸的文學大網，雖粗疏掛漏，難稱善本，但不能不佩服他的毅力。余先生的大作東剪西抄，却不能不佩服他的大瞻了。</p>
<p>如此妙手，何可不加讚揚，不走不敏，表而出之，附在那「一束好評」之後如何！</p>

<h3>平凡的事（十二）</h3>
<p>— 𣽃果孫</p>
<p>之光經過了大南門城門舊址，向西一望，已經看見了長興營造公司那架高竪在樓頂上的鐵招牌，雖然招間上的年安電流廣告，在白天顯不出甚麽光輝來；但是那個高大的鐵架子，已經可以顯出長興的發逹氣象。再走過去一點，他就望見廠門的外面立着幾個工人正抬頭向着天空閑望。</p>
<p>廠裏的沈寂景象，幾乎呌人疑心這一天是星期日的早晨，材料是各在其固有地位躺着的，工具是各在其固有地位擺着的；動的呢，只有三五個住在廠裏的工人，來來去去地在那枝自來水大管子跟前取水。之光那駕自行車的卜司豋豋的響聲，呌他們抬頭望過來』於是之光在向着他們點頭笑了一下之後、就拐了一個灣在辦公室前下車了。</p>
<p>三五分鐘之後，工人的幾個代表已經得著信息來和之光談話了∶</p>
<p>「張先生，」一個姓林的代表説，「我們昨天夜裏的那椿接濟閘北的事，還要靠你和姚老板去疏通。」</p>
<p>『對的，』之光説，『我是專門爲這件事來的。不過廠裏從前多少也好幾次接濟過閘北。』『這個我們也很淸楚。不過我們現在看看情形，閘北那裏要的接濟，實在一天比一天急。』『甚麽東西的用途』，一個姓邱的代表説，『聽説都一天比一天大了，從前營裏頭存下來的東西，聽説都用得一天比一天少了。廠裏到那裏去過的人都這様説…』之光聽到這裏，那雙壓在濃眉下面的近視眼，幾乎縐到没有縫兒，於是那副六方式的徵黃臉上，只有那張像兩片荷葉半開着的嘴，和嘴裏那一排白玉様的牙齒，能夠表示之光的智力。他問：</p>
<p>『廠裏一共去了多少人？』</p>
<p>『細數目，我們也没有？』姓林的説，『不過我們泥作裏面，去的比木作裏面多。』『木作裏面也不少，』姓邱的槍著説，『除了那些做細木工的』。</p>
<p>接著他們就輪番地向之光説了許許多多的姓名，和這許許多多的姓名所見的或者所做的許許多多的事：悲壯，熱烈，痛心，快意，呌旁人不敢不相信，又呌旁人不願意不相信，然而却非靜聽不可。之光開始靜聽的，後來這種報告的力量，就呌他想到他從前在法國做工時候兩件幾乎可以算得目覩的故事，</p>
<p>那時候，歐戰還没有停，他在法國南方某一個鐵廠裏做工，這鐵廠裏有一百多個中國工人，附近另外一個廠裏，有兩百多個非洲黑人做起卸搬運的事。某一天，大槪是一個全體休息的大紀念節，這兩種皮色不同的工人，都有一部分在野外游玩。不知爲著甚麽事彼此起了誤會，雙方就衝突起來，不到半天竟釀成一塲大規模的械鬥。中國工人因爲人數過少的關係，看著越來越不能支持，已經被黑人逼到一口大湖旁邊，儼然是背水之勢，忽然斜刺裏另外又來了八九十個向黑人猛攻的中國工人，好容易那些背水中國工人才脱了危險。後來，他們向他們謝了，於是才曉得那隊救兵全是安南工人。兩三天之後，當地的司法官，從各方面調查了那些因這次械鬥而受傷的三種人，認作都是闖禍的正犯，把他們傳到法庭，…法官問到那幾個安南工人的時候，格外責備他們不應當多管閑事，應當格外加重處罰。安南工人却先指著那些到案的中國工人的臉，再指著他們自己的臉，向法官説；『這都是一様的，你要加重處罰，我們也不後悔！』後來又指著那些黑人的臉，向自己的臉搖手説：『這不是一様的！』…當時知道這件事的人都很視爲一件值提研究的事。</p>

<h3>『頭彩』的憧憬</h3>
<p>— 賓符</p>
<p>如果有人在濳心研究中華的民族性的話，我以爲關於最近在中國社會上流行的『摩登思潮』是不可忽略的，否則，對華民族就難有深刻的認識。什麽是『摩登思潮』呢？這『摩登思潮』並非是三民主義，也不是國家主義更不是無政府主義，乃是近來時常在人們心頭湧起的『假使我中了頭彩』的心血潮。</p>
<p>我雖不敢説中國人個個在幻想著『假使我中了頭彩』，但幻想著『假使我中中</p>
<p>了頭彩』的人，怕是不在少數吧。因爲在事實上百萬或幾十萬條的獎劵都有了出路，那就足見人們買獎劵的熱心；旣有買劵的動機，誰個會不有『假使我中了頭彩』的想頭？</p>
<p>航空獎劵開獎的日期一天一天的近了，經營空在擺弄算盤子，計劃著怎様把這『五十萬』去另外經營一個事業！工人在工塲中想着怎様把錢拿到大旅館去開房間，尋開心，銀行員對著獎劵在微笑，想著怎様買了汽車，可以對科長主任施報復，投稿家放下了筆桿·想著怎様用了幾萬元去辦一個雜誌，可以免除人家奚落的難堪，黃包車夫也想著如果那化了一角大洋和同夥們合買的獎劵中了頭彩，可以分到五千元的大洋，那就不要再幹跑腿的睛等生活了，各個階級的各個人在夢想各人自己的利益，各個階級的各個人在憧憬著『美麗』的黃金。然而，各個階級的各個人儘化費了血汙換來的金錢或是儲蓄着的經濟，金田螺釣玉蟹似的去追求藴藏在『頭彩』中的『美麗』黃金，可是在『頭彩』中藴藏着的『美麗』黃金却不會也不能愛上買彩票的個個人。趨之若騖的埀着涎的這羣可憐蟲，只是對那恒河中『粒沙般的『黃金』女郎懐着『單相思』罷了。在這裏，赤裸裸地暴露了中國人徼倖投機的聰明，同時却也顯示了中國人不懂『或然率』的愚笨。</p>
<p>獎劵開彩的日子霎眼就到，到了那時，寒暑表温度也許　因　衆的失望降低一些吧。</p>

<h3>Central Political Council Discusses Ways to Handle Inspection Bureaus</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Political Council convened a high-level meeting on the morning of the 14th, attended by more than ten people including Wang Jingwei, to discuss new approaches for handling inspection bureaus. Regarding matters of receiving war zones, the Beiping Military Branch had already provided a detailed telegram report, which was also brought up for discussion. (14th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Wang Invites Gong and Peng to Discuss Post-Disaster Arrangements in Xinjiang Province</h3>
<p>Dai Chuanxian Likely Unable to Make the Trip</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang Jingwei invited Gong Bicheng and Peng Zhaoxian, the party affairs instructors of Xinjiang Province, to meet in the afternoon of the 14th. He inquired about methods for post-disaster arrangements in Xinjiang Province and urged Gong and others to quickly enter Xinjiang to investigate the truth and propagate the central government's benevolence. Gong and others also presented three points of opinion, which Wang greatly appreciated and promised to adopt as much as possible. According to Peng, Wang's handling of Liu Sheng was like a parent's treatment of an infant, hoping on the one hand that the infant would grow up quickly, and on the other hand hoping that he would become a useful talent after he grows up. As for the safety issue of Huang Mushong, it seems not as serious as the external rumors suggest. He has already sent a telegram to Wang, stating that after he and others arrive in Xinjiang, he will take the opportunity to return to Nanjing and request to appoint Liu Sheng as chairman to oversee the matter. Director Dai is physically weak and fears he will not be able to make the trip, or may give it up altogether. We are scheduled to depart on the 18th, but if time is short, we may change the departure to the 25th. (14th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Dai Chuanxian expressed to others that Jiang telegraphed asking him to go to Xinjiang to comfort the people, but his constitution is inherently weak, and he fears that a long flight would be beyond his physical capabilities, so he intends to ask to send another commissioner instead, so as not to spoil the matter. (14th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Executive Yuan of the National Government received a telegram yesterday from Bai Xier, the Commander-in-Chief of the Xinjiang National Revolutionary Army stationed in Hami to suppress rebellion, He Janiyasun, the Commander of the pre-defense stationed in Tuguh, and the division commanders and administrative chiefs of the Kashi and Aksu regions on June 21st. They recounted the history of Jin Shuren's brutal policies and abuse of the people in Xinjiang, and the uprising of the masses due to oppression. They stated that Jin has fled, and the cause of evil has been removed. Hereafter, all politics should still be subordinate to the central government, obey orders, and all military and diplomatic affairs should be handled by the central government. Premier Wang replied in a telegram on the 14th, hoping that each would lead their subordinates to protect the local area and harmonize the people. Wang's original telegram was as follows: "I have read your telegram of the (21st). Since the Xinjiang Incident, the central government has deeply known that it was caused by Jin Shuren's improper handling, so it has always advocated peaceful handling. Now that Jin Shuren has been dismissed, the central government's envoy Huang Mushong has arrived in Dihua to announce the central government's benevolence and relieve the suffering of the people of Xinjiang. Xinjiang is located in a border area and is related to national defense, so the central government attaches great importance to it, and it is especially egalitarian towards all ethnic groups living there. Regarding religious customs, each ethnic group respects their freedom, and mutually respects each other's freedom. As for political rights and obligations, all ethnic groups are equal. This is an unchangeable principle of governance. As for the distribution of powers between the central and local governments, the central government will preside over military and diplomatic affairs as described in your telegram, while education, transportation, industry, and other matters will be handled by the local government. This is generally feasible, and the central government will adopt it. I deeply hope that each will lead their subordinates to protect the local area and harmonize the people. I entrust you with my heart, and will not appoint different people. Each should understand this intention and widely proclaim it." Sincerely, Wang Zhaoming, Premier of the Executive Yuan.

<h3>Xue and Lei Arrive in Tangshan to Meet with Li to Discuss the Reorganization of Puppet Troops</h3>
<p>A War Zone Reorganization Committee Will Be Established, and Li Will Be Appointed as Chairman</p>
<p>Yongjin Will Be Retained in Tangshan to Assist Li, the Title Has Not Yet Been Determined</p>
<h3>The Opening of the Pingyu Railway is Still Difficult to Implement</h3>
<p>Xue Zhiheng and Lei Shourong of Tianjin arrived in Tangshan on the afternoon of the 14th and immediately met with Li Jichun. They are currently discussing the establishment of a War Zone Reorganization Committee, appointing Li as chairman and Xue and Lei as members. Because Li's troops have many Japanese personnel, for the sake of practical convenience, it is planned to retain Yongjin in Tangshan to assist in the reorganization. Previously, it was planned to give Li the title of War Zone [blank] Reorganization Commander, but since the word "commander" is not very appropriate, it has been decided to think of a more appropriate title, to be decided by Xue and Lei in consultation with Li. According to Yu Xuezhong, chairman of the provincial government, the sending of personnel to receive Huairou, Pinggu, Jixian, Yutian, and Ninghe is being rejected by the puppet troops, so it cannot be received until the reorganization of the puppet troops is completed. The special police have not yet started to be organized, because the Political Reorganization Committee has not yet stipulated where the funds will come from. It has not been stipulated where the cost of uniforms for the reorganization of Li's troops will come from. If the funds are raised from the provincial treasury, it will require hundreds of thousands of yuan per year. This item is not listed in the budget for the 22nd year, and although a supplementary budget may be added in the future, it is feared that it will not be enough. (14th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Xue Zhiheng and Lei Shourong took a special train to Tangshan at 9:00 AM on the morning of the 14th. The reporter met Lei at the East Station, who said that we have confirmed that Li's troops currently have 10,000 men, 6,000 will be eliminated, and 4,000 will be reorganized. The reorganization fee is a total of 230,000 yuan. However, Li's troops are scattered in various counties, and it takes time to assemble them. We will receive one county as Li's troops withdraw from it. If things go smoothly, we will return to Tianjin after the reorganization is completed. If there are difficulties, we will return to Tianjin for instructions. It is expected that it can be completed by the beginning of next month at the latest. The troops of Shi Yousan in Qinhuangdao are less than 3,000, and negotiations are underway, which may be easier to resolve. (14th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Xue Zhiheng and Lei Shourong left for Tangshan from Tianjin this morning to negotiate the reorganization of the puppet troops. After the puppet troop issue is settled, the reception of the war zone can begin. (14th Day Telegram) (Beiping) Xue Zhiheng and Lei Shourong took a special train to Tangshan this morning, accompanied by Japanese military officer Yongjin, with a total of 12 committee members and staff. The special train passed Tanggu at 12:00, and a representative of the Japanese Kwantung Army also boarded the train. They arrived in Tangshan at 1:40 PM. Tonight, Lei Shourong telegraphed from Tangshan, reporting that he had met with Li Jichun and others, and that a meeting was scheduled to be held tonight at the former site of Jiaotong University to discuss the reorganization of the puppet troops. It is hoped that things will go smoothly. Xue and others plan to stay in Tangshan for three days before returning to Tianjin to report to the War Zone Reception Committee. The puppet troops of Zhao Lei and Zheng Yanhou in Tangshan, Ninghe, Fengrun, and Yutian counties are still scattered in various places. The first step is to concentrate them in appropriate locations and dismiss them separately. The second step is to reorganize them. The number of security teams is limited to 4,000, stationed only in Luan County and Fengrun. (14th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) It is extremely hot in Peiping and Tianjin. The steel rails of the 30th bridge between Tanggu and Beitang on the Beining Railway were softened by the scorching sun.

More than 50 Japanese soldiers stationed in Tanggu took a special train to Tangshan at 9:30 AM on the morning of the 13th, but turned back at Lutai. It is unknown what they intended. (14th Day Special Dispatch)</p>

At the same time, he appointed Shao Shichi, his representative stationed in Guizhou, as the commander of the three routes in Sichuan and Kang, recruiting and incorporating various bandit leaders in the Sichuan border area, including Gao, Yuan, Pi, Cao, Lin, and Yang, in an attempt to disrupt the counties of Qinan and Fu (Liu Xiang's defense area), and hinder the plan of various armies to pacify bandits in Sichuan.

<h3>Fifth Meeting on the Sino-Eastern Railway Negotiation Again Yields No Results</h3>
<p>Soviet Russia Insists on Ownership of the Railway</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The fifth meeting on the transfer of the Sino-Eastern Railway was held at 2:00 PM today, lasting four hours. Soviet Russia still stubbornly adhered to its claim of ownership, and the meeting made no progress. It adjourned at 6:10 PM. The official communique stated that the fifth meeting reviewed the proposals of both parties, and the date of the next meeting will be decided by the secretaries-general of both parties. (14th Day Japanese Alliance Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The fifth meeting on the transfer of the Sino-Eastern Railway was held this afternoon at the official residence of the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs. From "Manchukuo", Ding Shiyuan, the puppet envoy, and Foreign Minister Ohashi and other attendants attended. From the Russian side, Ambassador Yurenev, Gazinovsky, and Kizilsov-Kosov and other attendants attended. From the Japanese side, Section Chief Nishi and Lieutenant Colonel Suzuki attended as observers. Chairman Ding Shiyuan will discuss specific issues, but the Soviet side will inevitably raise the issue of the ownership of the Sino-Eastern Railway again at the beginning of the meeting. Russia and Manchuria will refute each other repeatedly around this issue, so it is expected that the fifth meeting will not be able to reach a concrete conclusion. (14th Day Dentsu Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The opinions between Russia and Manchuria on the transfer of the Sino-Eastern Railway are widely divergent, resulting in a stalemate. It is rumored that the Japanese side will step in to mediate, but Director of the Information Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Amau issued a public announcement, denying the mediation theory. The general idea is that the government has no intention of mediating in any way, whether formally or informally, with the Russian and Manchurian authorities. The Japanese government only attends the transfer negotiations of the Sino-Eastern Railway as an observer, and also believes that it is not yet time to mediate on the transfer price and other matters, and has not given any consideration to the terms of the settlement. (14th Day Dentsu Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in light of the lack of progress in the negotiations on the transfer of the Sino-Eastern Railway, originally intended to take the opportunity to come forward and mediate. However, recently, the representative of the Manchurian side issued a tough statement to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stating that the transfer price is 50 million yuan and cannot be lowered any further. If the Soviet side continues to insist on unrealistic claims, the negotiations will have to be terminated. As for the actions to be taken by "Manchukuo" at that time, related agencies have been ordered to prepare to take over the Sino-Eastern Railway. Now that matters have reached this point, it seems that the Japanese authorities have abandoned the unreasonable policy of mediation at this time. (14th Day Dentsu Telegram)</p>
<h3>The Case of the Public Canteens in Soviet Russia</h3>

Only a few fishermen live on the islands, and fishing boats from Hainan Island also frequent them. According to American surveyors, the islands are 200 miles outside the Philippine territory. (13th National Telegram)</p>

The total area of ​​the islands is only about 300 acres, or less than half a square mile. (Reuters, 14th)</p>

<h3>As a Result of Japanese Aggression Against China, the Number of Disabled and Retired Soldiers Reaches 10,000</h3>
<p>Most Are Farmers, Greatly Affecting the Countryside</p>

According to military statistics, the number of retired soldiers who cannot return to their old jobs is nearly 10,000. Most of these people are farmers or children of farmers, so the farmers are greatly affected. Currently, several major public companies in Japan are hiring disabled soldiers, but due to the excessive number of disabled people, it is of no help. Therefore, the government is now trying to get well-known figures from all walks of life to find ways to employ retired soldiers. (Reuters, 14th)</p>

<h3>Problems After the Recovery of Dolon</h3>
<p>Feng Yuxiang's telegram reporting the recovery of Dolon by the Anti-Japanese Allied Army is the most exciting news since the bloody battle of Xifengkou. In recent months, the news from North China has only increased the degree of disappointment of the Chinese people in national affairs. The so-called Chahar problem caused by Feng's establishment of a banner in Zhangjiakou has, through external activities, become a source of major domestic disputes, which is especially painful for those who are concerned about the times. Now Feng's telegram reports</p>
<p>the recovery of Dolon. Even the authorities in Peiping, who are concentrating their efforts on resolving the Chahar issue, consider the matter to be somewhat satisfactory, and believe that the war disaster imagined by the general public can be put at ease. Can the depression of the people of the country be slightly relieved? However, observing the current internal and external situation, the recovery of Dolon can only be regarded as the key to changing the situation in Chahar. If the people of the country take a completely optimistic attitude towards it, the future change in the situation may not be as satisfactory as they expect, and they will be even more disappointed.</p>
<p>The situation after the recovery of Dolon can be discussed from three aspects: 1) In terms of the Japanese army's attitude towards Chahar Province, the Anti-Japanese Allied Army has not encountered serious resistance from the Japanese army this time from acquiring Guyuan, Baochang, and Kangbao to entering Dolon. This is related to the Japanese army's entire plan for Chahar, and it is not that they are unable to fight to this extent. In the future, will the Japanese army abandon Chahar Province and only occupy Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang? Since Dolon still belongs to Chahar, if Feng's army does not advance further to attack Rehe, the Japanese army will not launch a counterattack against Dolon. Will they, as in a previous rumor, aim to occupy Zhangjiakou? Then their concentration of troops on the border of Rehe will inevitably launch a rapid counterattack against Dolon, taking advantage of the situation to invade westward in order to complete their predetermined plan. This concerns the enemy's fundamental plan and cannot be observed from the surface. 2) In terms of domestic issues for resolving the Chahar situation, Peiping and Zhangjiakou are now in a state of tension with four steps already in motion. The so-called four steps begin with "ending anti-Japanese military affairs," followed by "abolishing the name of the Allied Army." The remaining issues of Song returning to Chahar and inviting Feng to take charge of forestry and reclamation are merely related accessories. What we want to know today is whether the tense situation between Xuanhua and Huailai has worsened with the recovery of Dolon, or whether it has been eased by it. If Pang Bingxun's army takes over the defense area of Sun Dianying's troops and advances further, will Feng, with Dolon recovered and having a place to retreat, peacefully cede Xuanhua and Zhangjiakou? Or will they aim their guns both internally and externally? This concerns the determination of both sides. 3) Regarding the Anti-Japanese Allied Army itself, Feng Yuxiang once expressed to people regarding the proposal of the Peiping authorities that once Dolon is recovered, everything will not be a problem. The Peiping authorities hope that if the goal of recovering Dolon and protecting Chahar has been achieved, Feng can end everything. Now that Dolon has been effectively recovered, is everything not a problem? Can Feng end everything? This is an especially important question. We should try to recall the various events after the September 18th Incident that were enough to excite people. Most of them occurred when news of the event spread, and newspaper readers mostly felt excited and rarely felt pessimistic. The recovery of Dolon by the Anti-Japanese Allied Army this time, in fact, means recovering more than two hundred kilometers of lost territory, which should shock the world for a time. But how is the psychology of the people of the country today compared to when the 19th Route Army resisted the Japanese in Shanghai, and how is it compared to when Song Zheyuan fought a bloody battle in Xifengkou? This is also a question outside the question.</p>
<h3>World Economic Conference Adjourned Sine Die</h3>
<p>Announced at the plenary session on the 27th of this month</p>
<p>The issue of reconvening the conference is left to the steering committee to handle</p>
<p>(London) According to official news, the World Economic Conference will hold a plenary session on July 27th to announce the adjournment of the conference. (Reuters dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>(London) The steering committee has requested each subcommittee to complete its work before July 21st. The steering committee will meet on July 25th to</p>
<p>conclude various matters, and then hold a plenary session on the 26th or 27th to announce the adjournment of the conference. (Reuters dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>(London) It is expected that the plenary session on July 27th will leave the issue of reconvening the conference after the adjournment to the steering committee for handling, and authorize the steering committee to convene representatives of various countries to reconvene the conference when the world situation is more suitable for discussing all the major issues in the original agenda. Chairman MacDonald will report on the work that has been accomplished at the plenary session, and express that the unresolved issues still have the possibility of reaching an agreement. The decision to hold a plenary session was announced after a meeting of the steering committee this morning. The steering committee expressed its dissatisfaction with the current situation at the morning meeting, and felt that it should curb the rambling and inconclusive talks, so it decided to instruct each subcommittee to submit everything by July 21st at the latest. After each subcommittee submits its report, the two major committees of the Economic Conference will separate the plenary session, and then the steering committee will make a final decision on July 25th regarding the issue of holding a plenary session of members to announce the adjournment of the conference. It is heard from influential sources at the Economic Conference that there will be a proposal to adjourn the conference for about three months and reconvene in the autumn. Representatives from some of the more distant countries believe that too long an adjournment will make it impossible for them to come to London a second time. Former US Secretary of State Stimson suddenly made an unexpected visit to London this morning and had a long meeting with the current Secretary of State Hull. (Reuters dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<h3>The European Gold Bloc's Line is Firm</h3>
<p>The Pittman Silver Agreement Suffers Setbacks</p>
<p>Revised Provisions Satisfy Dutch and French Demands</p>
<p>Hopes to be Fully Agreed Upon Next Monday</p>
<p>(London) Just as the eight major silver-holding and silver-producing countries were preparing to sign the initial letters on Friday for an agreement to restrict silver production and sales, they were thwarted by the emergence of gold standard countries, and they were unable to implement it. It is now expected that it will be extended to Monday at the earliest in order to revise it to meet the demands of the Netherlands and France. However, the basic provisions regarding limiting the amount of silver supplied to the market in the next five years will not be greatly changed. At present, only the annual sales of silver by China, Spain, and India have not yet been agreed upon in these basic provisions, but it is heard that the opinions of the three countries are not far apart and it will not be difficult to reach an agreement. As for the wording of the clause in the Netherlands' objection to the provision stipulating that silver be used as currency reserves, it is currently being redrafted by Chairman Pittman. According to Pittman tonight, the negotiations are still making satisfactory progress, so it is expected that they will be able to fully agree and prepare to initial the first letters by Monday. This agreement was originally scheduled to be submitted to the Monetary Committee tomorrow. The emergence of gold standard countries to thwart it today shows that they will fight against any plan that tends to weaken the gold standard, and some representatives of gold standard countries have privately told reporters that they will do their best to obstruct consideration of other issues until a universal stability agreement is reached.

<h3>The Conference Pays Attention to the Pittman Silver Bill</h3>
<p>Britain Opposes the French Public Works Bill</p>
<p>(London) What made people</p>
<p>take note of at today's meeting of the World Economic Conference was the US representative Pittman's silver bill, and the French proposal to use foreign capital to carry out public works projects when domestic funds are insufficient. Pittman suggested to the Silver Subcommittee that the method of restoring the price of silver be: 1) Use silver coins to replace low-value paper money; 2) Restore the fineness of coins to at least 800 to 1000; 3) Do not levy import taxes on silver; 4) Consider reducing or abolishing import taxes on silver; 5) Do not flood the market with surplus silver before January 1, 1938. Pittman had previously proposed a bill on silver when the conference first opened, but now he has withdrawn the previous bill and replaced it with this proposal. Pittman asked the countries participating in the meeting to agree to the above methods.</p>
<p>The bill on public works projects proposed by France was endorsed by the chairman of the International Labor Bureau and other important members, but the British merchant Siemens resolutely opposed this proposal, saying that Britain has recently spent 100 million pounds on public works projects to relieve unemployment, and this number is considered too large and cannot be done again. If other countries decide to make this attempt, Britain is unwilling to interfere with it, but Britain is not willing to participate in the discussion of international policies on public works projects, nor is it willing to participate in raising funds to supply other countries to implement this policy.</p>
<p>The Chinese representative Guo Taiqi then spoke and described the situation in China, saying that China has good opportunities for profitable undertakings. China's policy is to develop the country with appropriate public works projects such as transportation, and its procedure and purpose are limited only by financial resources. China urgently wants to improve living standards and expand the scope of skilled work. One of the greatest potentials for solving the economic panic lies in the current proposal. There is no shortage of countries in the world that urgently need to develop programs but do not have the strength to do so without external assistance, and China is one of them. This is one point that the conference should pay direct attention to. After the debate on this case, Chairman Corrien decided to submit the French proposal to the steering committee for review in the form of an indefinite postponement of the action on this case.

<h3>The Reopening of the Conference is Indefinite</h3>
<p>(London) After unexpected storms and hardships, the World Economic Conference decided today to adjourn on July 27th. There has been no indication as to when it will be reconvened, but the conference side has little illusion about the prospect of an early reopening of the meeting. The only noteworthy event that was forced today was the discussion between the four major producing countries and the Soviet Russia in order to establish a method of export restriction. It is heard that Canada, Australia, the United States, and Argentina suggested that the Soviet Russia should limit wheat exports to 25 million bushels per year. The Russian representative said that this number is completely disproportionate to the annual output of Russia, and he can assist experts in compiling tables to show the wheat production and output of Russia in the past few years.</p>
<p>The Central Bank Cooperation Plan, which had stalled the work of the Second Monetary Committee due to the US refusal to participate in the discussion, may now need to be discussed again. It is heard that the US bear's attitude towards this issue has changed slightly. According to reliable sources, the US representative Pittman will modify his previous remarks at the committee meeting this afternoon and express that the United States does not object to discussing this case. (Reuters dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<h3>Situations of Various Subcommittees</h3>
<p>(London) The meeting situation of the various subcommittees and subcommittees of the Economic Conference today is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Debt Issue Drafting Subcommittee paid attention to considering four proposals: 1) Bulgaria proposed a thorough resolution of existing debts, replacing the various bonds currently issued with one type of bond, reducing its funds, and stipulating a lower interest rate, while also announcing a short-term suspension of payment; 2) The United Kingdom requested a supplementary report on the amount of long-term and short-term loans, and strict supervision of the issuance of bonds; 3) France advocated that the period of bad debts should be eliminated quickly; 4) The Netherlands requested that the ability of debtors to repay should be taken into account when resolving debts. US representative Senator Gorns once again aroused the surprise of the general public by requesting that the drafting subcommittee indefinitely adjourn, but other</p>
<p>Representatives of various countries opposed the adjournment, and the subcommittee decided to continue its work.</p>
<p>The Radical Cure Subcommittee of the Monetary Committee is scheduled to convene a meeting in the afternoon so that US representative Pittman can explain his new bear's attitude of not wanting to discuss the issue of cooperation between central banks. The Veterinary Issue Drafting Subcommittee of the Economic Committee submitted two draft resolutions to the Indirect Protection Policy Subcommittee, one of which advocated convening a meeting of all relevant importing and exporting countries, and the other advocated that the governments of all countries should consult with all relevant countries before deciding on new methods for veterinary issues.</p>
<p>The work of the Drafting Subcommittee of the Economic Committee's Commercial Policy Subcommittee largely agreed with the text of the report recording the tendencies of representatives of various countries. During the discussion, the US delegation insisted that the report should advocate the full maintenance of the most-favored-nation clause. (Havas dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<h3>The Russian Economic Non-Aggression Proposal Has Been Handed Over to the Committee</h3>
<p>(London) When Soviet Russian representative Melaok urged the conference today to adopt the Economic Non-Aggression Pact proposal, he stated that Soviet Russia has a vast territory and abundant resources. In terms of economic development, it can be completely independent. However, economic warfare cannot be limited to one region, so for the sake of all countries, an Economic Non-Aggression Pact should be adopted. He also said that various efforts to destroy the Soviet economic system have not been effective and have not harmed the economic life of Soviet Russia, but the countries engaged in economic warfare have all suffered from it. The pact stipulates that non-participation in economic aggression does not prevent countries from concluding preferential trade treaties, but only regards seizing the trade of one country by another as illegal. However, the Economic Committee, because the convening of this conference lies in eliminating various trade barriers, regards this proposal as unable to have</p>
<h3>People and Pigs are Liberated at the Same Time</h3>

Austria allows the import of Polish pigs, and Poland cancels the ban on traveling to Austria. Afterwards, whenever a Pole travels to Austria, Austria will allow the import of three Polish pigs. (National Telegram on the 13th)</p>
<p>any real benefits. Moreover, since several major powers are currently competing to attract Soviet Russian trade, therefore the representatives mostly took a dismissive view of the remarks that someone was engaged in an economic war with Soviet Russia. As a result, this proposal of Soviet Russia was handed over to the committee, and another issue was added to the list of issues that cannot be resolved before the stabilization of currency is resolved. (National Telegram on the 13th)</p>
<p>(London) A minor storm arose at today's plenary meeting of the Economic Committee of the World Economic Conference when discussing the draft of the Soviet Russian economic truce and the proposal to develop the possibility of import trade between various countries. The representative of the Southern Ireland Free State, Connolly, spoke in favor of the Soviet Russian motion, and then mentioned the Anglo-Irish tariff war. The chairman asked him to pay attention to order and not involve events unrelated to this case. Connolly still did not change his attitude, but after arguing with the chairman, he withdrew from the meeting, claiming that he reserved the right to distribute his arguments to the representatives of various countries. The audience in the gallery applauded in agreement, and the chairman expressed dissatisfaction with this. The Economic Committee finally decided to shelve the discussion of the Economic Non-Aggression event. (10th</p>

<h3>Wheat Production Restriction Issue</h3>
<p>(London) At today's meeting between British Prime Minister MacDonald and representatives of countries related to the wheat industry, Dutch Prime Minister Dr. Corrien suggested that a subcommittee be set up by the importing and exporting countries to establish an agreement within the structure of the World Economic Conference. US representative Morganthau opposed this proposal, saying that the exporting countries should first reach an agreement. The four major wheat-producing countries had suggested a few days ago that the wheat transported to Europe by the countries in the Danube River basin should be limited to 50 million bushels per year, but these countries are now requesting 56 million bushels.

<p>High Tin Prices and Shortage of Chinese Laborers</p>
<p>Reuters Singapore dispatch on the 14th: It was reported today that</p>
<p>after the rise in tin prices, the rubber plantations in Malaysia are suffering from a shortage of Chinese laborers. Two or three years ago, when tin prices fell sharply, Chinese laborers in the tin mines mostly hired themselves out in rubber plantations. Now that tin prices have risen, they have returned to the mines to manage their old businesses. For this reason, someone has now petitioned the government to lift the ban on the import of Chinese laborers. According to the Malaysian government, in order to reduce unemployment among Chinese laborers three years ago, it banned Chinese laborers from entering the country. In these three years, no less than 200,000 Chinese laborers have been deported from Malaysia and Singapore.</p>
<h3>Strikes in Three US States</h3>
<p>Reuters New York dispatch on the 14th: Just as the National Industrial Recovery Committee is striving to formulate regulations to manage the wages and working conditions of the United States, 23,000 workers in the states of New York, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania suddenly announced a strike.

<p>Applying Pressure to Japan to Accept the League of Nations Report</p>
<p>Consolidating China's Economic and Political Status and Implementing Long-Term Resistance</p>
<h3>Expressing Gratification at the Change in British Attitude</h3>
<p>(London) At a League of Nations Union banquet today, Yen Hui-ching delivered a speech, stating that the League of Nations Assembly's report on the Manchurian problem will be recorded in history as one of the most important documents in striving for international peace, justice, and fairness. Japan's aggression has overturned the balance of power in the Far East. If this balance is not restored, there will be extremely serious developments in the Pacific. Japan's past and present military activities in the Northeast are greatly disturbing world peace. China has not been able to exercise its rights under Article 15 of the League of Nations Covenant, and for other reasons, has not been able to express its legitimate anger. However, this absolutely does not mean that China is willing to accept the established situation or recognize a situation created by force and considered by the civilized world to be completely incompatible with the general provisions of international law. The plan that China must adopt is: 1) China must exert pressure on Japan to accept the League of Nations Assembly's report; 2) China must find ways to consolidate its economic and political position so that it can prolong its resistance against Japan. He is very pleased to see that the attitude of the United Kingdom towards this matter has recently changed. This is because the United Kingdom is gradually realizing that, in addition to upholding the League of Nations resolution, for its own interests, especially in the current era of economic panic, it is imperative to pay attention to the possibility of China as the only major market and investment site. British trade with China currently accounts for only 2% of the United Kingdom's total foreign trade, and there is a real need for expansion. The development of Sino-British commercial relations will not only benefit the United Kingdom, but also enable the United Kingdom to implement a part of the League of Nations report's provisions. Dr. Yen finally mentioned the generous treatment received by the Chinese delegation to the World Economic Conference in the United Kingdom, saying that this has created an unforgettable impression.

<h3>The World Thirty Years Hence</h3>

<h3>Henderson Arrives in Rome</h3>
<p>(National Press, Rome, 13th) Disarmament Conference Chairman Henderson arrived safely in the Italian capital this evening. He will be received by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini tomorrow. Political circles here say that Henderson's visit will not only clarify Italy's strong support for the future of the Disarmament Conference and its determination to succeed, but also clarify that even if the Geneva Conference is unsuccessful in the future, the countries of the Strong Pact can link up with each other and conclude a treaty. The Convention already has clear provisions for this. Moreover, as things stand, if the countries of the Four-Power Pact can immediately begin consultations, the possibility of future mutual understanding is easier than that of the Disarmament Conference. The only worry is whether France will continue its traditional policy and think about coercing Geneva to engage in discussions on outstanding issues. However, Henderson must have a clear plan in mind and decide what kind of proposal to make to Germany when he visits Berlin later. According to reports, Henderson will visit Germany after his tour of European countries.</p>
<h3>Major Disaster on the Volga River</h3>

The aim is to gain worldwide sympathy for India by being arrested and imprisoned. This plan has caused opposition within the National Congress, believing that it will not help India's final progress towards political freedom.</p>
<h3>Complete Withdrawal Within Ten Days</h3>
<p>The Japanese troops in Miyun and other areas must be completely withdrawn in the end.</p>
<p>The reorganized puppet troops in the received war zone will be processed separately.</p>
<p>Several negotiations with Japan since the Armistice Agreement</p>
<p>(Beiping Special Dispatch) The Japanese side recently claimed to our side that the Japanese troops within the war zone can be completely withdrawn within ten days, but the garrison in Miyun must be withdrawn in the end for two reasons: 1) There are still anti-Japanese organizations in Chahar; 2) The Japanese troops suffered extremely heavy casualties in the battle near Gubeikou, and the soldiers are grieving. The troops cannot be withdrawn until the remains of the fallen soldiers are properly buried. These statements from the Japanese side are all pretexts to delay the withdrawal of Japanese troops in Miyun and other areas. Therefore, there is extreme suspicion about whether the Japanese troops can be completely withdrawn within ten days, and special attention is paid to whether the Japanese troops in Miyun can be withdrawn for a while. In recent days, the Japanese troops near Ninghe on the east road and Tangshan and other places have begun to withdraw and concentrate in Luanzhou and Qinhuangdao. The Japanese troops in the Luanhe area are gradually withdrawing to Shanhaiguan and Jinzhou. There is still a regiment stationed near Lengkou, and there are also hundreds of people in Jianchangying. It is reported that the Japanese troops regard Jianchangying as an important fortress near Lengkou, and the Japanese troops there are not preparing to withdraw for the time being. The same is true for Xifengkou and Gubeikou. It is planned to station a portion of Japanese</p>
<p>troops in Santunying near Xifengkou and Shixia in Gubeikou to consolidate the defenses of the Great Wall line. The Japanese troops in Tongzhou, Sanhe, Xianghe, Yutian, Pinggu, Shunyi,</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>etc., have already withdrawn completely. Except for Tongzhou and Shunyi, where order has been completely restored, the other counties have not been taken over. Local security is temporarily maintained by local people organizing their own militias. A few dozen Japanese troops are stationed in Jixian and Zunhua, etc., and they will be withdrawn soon. Most of the 8th Division of the Japanese Army in Gubeikou has retreated to Chengde. A regiment is stationed in Gubeikou, and two or three hundred people are in Miyun. A few dozen people have also been left in Huairou and have not been withdrawn. The withdrawal of the Japanese troops is extremely slow, and our side has not been able to take over smoothly due to the problems of the puppet troops. Since the meeting in Dalian, Xue Zhiheng and others have come to Beiping to discuss solutions. The handover procedures for the reorganization of the puppet troops and the Beining transportation war zone have all been in sight. The Reception Committee convened a meeting in Tianjin yesterday to discuss all the procedures and has distributed the work. Work will begin immediately. Regarding the reorganization of the puppet troops, Xue Zhiheng and Lei Shourong will be responsible for contacting and working with personnel sent by the Hebei Provincial Government to count and reorganize the troops. Xue and Lei will go to Tangshan immediately to make another contact with Li Jichun and then begin counting and reorganizing. The reception of the war zone east of Tangshan is planned to be guided by Yin Tong and Li Zeyi, accompanied by the county magistrates and public security chiefs to take over. Tao Shangming will be responsible for negotiating with the Japanese side and guiding the receiving personnel to receive the counties in Pingdong and Pingbei in sequence. Qian Zongze and Liu Shisun will be responsible for the opening of the Beining railway. The railway will be opened to Luozhou first, and then will seek to reach Shanhaiguan directly. As for the sorting out of the war zone and the internal affairs of the Reception Committee, Yu Xuezhong and Wei Jian will be responsible for presiding over them. The reception of the war zone can begin immediately and is expected to be completed within a month.</p>
<p>The establishment of the Armistice Agreement and the end of the war this time was a painful act of tolerance that was taken only as a last resort. Since the signing of the Armistice Agreement, the Chinese people have been swallowing their anger and the Japanese have been arrogant. The authorities felt extreme diplomatic difficulties in dealing with the agreement, and unexpected disputes that occurred temporarily were even more difficult to deal with. A weak country has no diplomacy. In order to seek a compromise, it had to be a tolerant submission. In the case of the shooting on the Dongdan tram, the Japanese side insisted that it was a provocation. After repeated negotiations, it finally ended with a formal apology to the Japanese side. In the case of the Japanese side arbitrarily arresting the Korean Independence Party leader Li Yongxiang in the public office of the capital, our side raised a negotiation with Japan on the basis of sovereignty, but the Japanese side ignored it and our side could do nothing. However, when the plainclothes leader Hao Peng was arrested in Tianjin, the Japanese side made a serious negotiation, threatening to use force. The authorities were afraid of creating difficulties and telegraphed the Tianjin local authorities to release him. This unpardonable traitor was released by the Japanese on the 9th with the help of the Japanese, and was taken to the Zhang Garden in the Japanese concession to continue his traitorous work.

<h3>Receiving War Zones Still Faces Many Difficulties</h3>
<p>Difficult to Raise Funds for Assembled Pseudo-Troops</p>
<p>Shi Yousan's Forces Also Difficult to Resolve</p>
<p>Tianjin Special Dispatch: War Zone Receiving Committee members Xue Zhiheng, Yin Tong, and Lei Shourong went to Dalian to negotiate with the Japanese and puppet authorities regarding the reception of war zones. On the afternoon of the 8th, Xue, Yin, and Lei returned to Ping to report on their mission. News reporters from Tianjin and Beijing wanted to know the truth of the meeting to dispel the doubts of the people. It was recently learned that Lei and Yin were staying at No. 21 Haihe Road, Special District No. 1, Tianjin, in the Beining Road official residence, while Xue stayed at the Chongxing Company on Shou Street in the Japanese Concession. They went to their residences, but were all turned away. It was not until yesterday (the 11th) that they met Xue Zhiheng at the provincial government. After a few hasty words, Xue jumped into a car and left like a startled goose. The reporters then went to Haihe Road to visit Lei and Yin, but were still turned away. However, the reporters were sure that Lei and Yin were inside, so they were determined to see them. By this time it was already 6:30 PM. At 7:20 PM, the Japanese representative, Nagatsu, arrived in Tianjin. Lei and Yin had to go to the East Railway Station to welcome him. Fearing that the reporters would wait and not leave, preventing them from going out, Lei agreed to meet with them, saying that they had negotiated for a week in Dalian, but had not formed a meeting format. Everyone was casually chatting in their residences, barefoot and disheveled. There was nothing secret about the content. Because the Tanggu Truce was opposed by many, some out of patriotic indignation, and others for political reasons, the committee members agreed not to publish anything about the Dalian negotiations to avoid hindering the actual progress. They asked for everyone's understanding on this matter. At this point, Yin Tong interrupted, his face and physique closely resembling those of a foreigner, looking at his watch and saying, "There are still thirty minutes, we must go to the station." Yin's intention was to cut off Lei's talk before he got to the main point, so as to break the encirclement and leave. Unexpectedly, an ignorant servant chimed in, saying, "It only takes ten minutes to get to the East Station by car from here. If you leave now, you will still have to wait for twenty minutes." Yin and Lei looked at each other in silence, and then resumed the conversation with the reporters. However, they only revealed one or two things about the Dalian negotiations.</p>
<p>The Dalian negotiation records only exist in Japanese and not in Chinese (because no one has found the Chinese version). The content is divided into two main parts: (1) the disposition of the pseudo-troops and (2) the opening of the Tangshan-Yuguan section of the Beining Railway. Regarding the first item, Li Jichun's troops definitely have more than ten thousand men, but only three or four thousand firearms. The situation is that there are many officers but few soldiers, and many soldiers but few guns. Our side's reorganization standard is one person, one gun. Li did not insist on opposing the reorganization of four thousand men. The surplus personnel, both soldiers and officers, would be given twenty yuan and fifty yuan respectively and dismissed on the spot. The reorganized personnel would be formed into two police battalions, led by people recommended by Li, with salaries paid by our side for one month. Our side initially did not agree to this. All surplus officers and soldiers would be given twenty yuan each and dispersed in the Machang area. The two battalion commanders would need to be appointed by our side. The surplus firearms would be bought by us, with twenty yuan per large gun and fifty yuan per small gun. The title for Li was quite carefully considered. It is said that two methods are being considered: (1) giving him a corresponding position in the Beiping Military Affairs Commission, or (2) giving him the title of General Supervisor of War Zone Police Training. However, it is not yet fully determined. This is why Xue Zhiheng needs to go to Tangshan again to meet with Li for a final consultation. However, this is a minor issue and should not be difficult to resolve. The next issue is the funding for the reorganization, which will require at least three to four hundred thousand yuan. The central government hopes that Hebei Province will raise the funds itself, but Hebei Province is too impoverished to do so. Therefore, the committee members hope to start the reorganization on the 15th and complete it before the 25th, and then take over the political power of the counties, completing the entire reception within this month. Little do they know that reorganization is easy, but raising funds is difficult. In general, the reorganization will start on the 15th, but it may be difficult to achieve in reality. Regarding the second item, the opening of the Tangshan-Yuguan section of the Beining Railway, the inside story was quite complicated during the Dalian negotiations, not as simple and optimistic as rumored. Our side plans to open the railway to Luanzhou in the first step after Li's troops are resolved, and to Beidaihe in the second step. Opening the railway from Beidaihe to Yuguan still faces difficulties. Our side hopes that Li's troops will leave the railway line after reorganization and be stationed in Fengrun and Luanxian to avoid interfering with railway administration. However, although this is what we hope, it remains questionable whether it can be achieved in reality. In addition, there is an even greater difficulty, namely that during the Tianjin Incident of the previous year, Shi Yousan purchased 50,000 firearms from Japan. Japan sold them at half price because they benefited from Shi's disturbance in Tianjin. Three months ago, Shi went to Qinhuangdao and established a military cadre school there, training junior officers and hiring Japanese military instructors. There are a total of 1,500 students, mostly young graduates of middle and small schools recruited from outside the customs. Shi was not mentioned at all in the Dalian talks, which is regrettable. According to Lei and Yin, they hope that Shi's troops can be incorporated into Li's troops for resolution. However, it remains questionable whether this can be achieved in reality. If we look at Luandong, which is shaped like an enclave (and Luansi is no different), the Japanese do not care, Shi does not comply, and our side cannot reach him, what can be done? According to another source, it would not be difficult for our side to open the railway to Yuguan, as long as we agree to joint operations with the puppet Fengshan Railway. If we agree to this, wouldn't it be absurd? But how things will ultimately turn out remains to be seen as events unfold. (July 12)</p>
<h3>Traitor Hao Peng Regains Freedom</h3>
<p>Japanese Consul in Tianjin Protests, Diplomatic Atmosphere Extremely Bad</p>
<p>Diwei Road Suddenly Under Temporary Martial Law</p>
<p>Cars Carrying Hao Enter Japanese Concession</p>
<p>Tianjin Special Dispatch: The traitor Hao Peng was seized by his subordinates Yuan and Li at dawn on the 6th of this month and taken to the First Army Corps headquarters. The people were overjoyed, expecting that even if he was not beheaded, he would certainly be shot, and at the very least, he would be strangled like the Shanghai traitor Hu Lifu, leaving a complete corpse. Who knew that things would go completely wrong, contrary to expectations? Hao has actually regained his freedom. The details of what happened are as follows:</p>
<p>Hao Peng, having been sold into prison by his subordinates, knew that his crimes were heinous and could not be tolerated by the law. Therefore, he asked people everywhere to intercede for him, hoping to save his life and be sentenced to life imprisonment. On the one hand, he made extremely cunning confessions to the military court, vaguely saying that his organization was absolutely not for treason, but against non-resistance, dissatisfied with the current political situation, and intended to use foreign forces to improve politics and protect the country. Because he lived in the Japanese Concession, he was ignorant and isolated, no different from being trapped in a gourd, being played with without knowing it. Furthermore, many people said that the troops in North China had matured to 200,000 men, and as long as a signal flare was fired, there would be responses from all sides. A lot of money was spent on the movement. He thought that the Japanese were not fools, and they would not be willing to spend so much money without being certain of success. He also said that he recruited 2,000 plainclothes agents in the Japanese Concession and issued firearms on May 19, mostly hand grenades. The first person to throw a hand grenade would be given 100 yuan, and then 50 yuan per day. That night, only two or three hundred plainclothes agents were sent out, and only a few dozen returned. Most of the others threw their hand grenades aside and fled in the night. Not a single soldier responded. Only then did he realize that these people were unreliable, but he was in a situation where he could not back down, like an arrow on the string. So he continued to do it for a few more nights, but still failed. As for Chairman Yu's diligence and integrity, he admired him very much and always loved and respected him. He knew nothing about anyone plotting to assassinate Chairman Yu, and so on.</p>
<p>After Hao Peng was detained, many frustrated politicians lobbied and pleaded for him. He was taken to the military court at 10 AM on July 6. The Japanese consul in Tianjin, Tanaka, went to the provincial government to see Chairman Yu and protested against the arrest of people across the border, which was presumptuous. Yu said that his subordinates had mutinied and sent him in for a reward. He was a wanted criminal by the central government, and he would naturally take him in. He had telegraphed the central government for instructions. Tanaka said that there was no need to argue about this for the time being, and he would wait for the investigation before saying anything else. Before the investigation was clear, he must not dispose of Hao to avoid him dying without proof. Yu told him that he would not dispose of him without authorization. Tanaka also requested to meet with Hao for a talk, which Yu politely declined. At 3 PM the next afternoon, the commander of the Japanese Concession military police (also a staff officer of the garrison headquarters), Major Mori, fully armed, arrived at the provincial government by car. First he asked to see Chairman Yu, and then he wanted to meet with Hao Peng. Since Yu was out on official business, no one was in charge, and Mori left angrily. From the third day onwards, even more people interceded for Hao. At that time, the Japanese side had already settled the matter in the former capital. Yu was forced by circumstances and could do nothing. Therefore, three solutions were decided: (1) send him to Beiping for disposal, (2) hand him over to the court for trial, and (3) have him sentenced to life imprisonment by the military court. However, none of these three solutions were approved by Beiping, and the diplomatic atmosphere was very bad, saying that if Hao was not released, the reception of the war zones would be hindered. Therefore, weighing the importance of the matter, he had to release the prisoner and cancel the arrest warrant to complete the official procedures. On the evening of the 10th, the Japanese Concession side repeatedly called, urging his release. On the morning of the 11th, Hebei Diwei Road, Dajing Road, Dahutong, and Dongma Road were temporarily under martial law. At that moment, several cars drove into the Japanese Concession, followed by a burst of applause and cheers, and Hao Peng regained his freedom. (Written by Caofu on the 12th)</p>
<h3>Southern Route Bandit Suppression Troops</h3>
<p>The Seventh and Eighth Divisions Advance to Liuche and Sanbiao</p>
<p>The Second Division's Military Reputation Causes Bandits Attacking Chongshiwei to Collapse</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: The military affairs of the southern route bandit suppression troops have recently made considerable progress. The Guangdong army has repeatedly come into contact with bandits in the past month. The bandit gangs in the areas near Junmenting and Anyuan are still attacking the official army's defense lines from time to time. The bandits gathered in the Junmenting area are particularly numerous. The Xie Regiment of the Eighth Division of the Guangdong Army advanced toward Sanbiao on the 4th of this month. About three or four hundred bandits in the area resisted slightly and fled north. The Xie Regiment then occupied Sanbiao. At the same time, the 19th Regiment of the Seventh Division advanced toward Liuche, which belongs to Huichang, on the 6th. The red bandits in Liuche fled upon hearing the news. For the sake of caution, the 19th Regiment temporarily stationed on the high ground outside Liuche to prevent a bandit counterattack. While the various units of the Second Detachment were stationed in the Liuche and Sanbiao area, the First Column also sent troops to advance along the Anyuan line in order to establish contact with the Seventh and Eighth Divisions of the Second Detachment. However, fierce battles with bandits in the northeastern areas of Anyuan have been quite intense in recent days. Fortunately, Chen Jing's 32nd Regiment of the Fourth Division of the Second Army transferred the troops stationed in Longbu back to join the suppression, and the bandits attacking Chongshiwei were defeated. According to a telegram from Commander Chen from the front line yesterday, the bandits attacking Chongshi had retreated at night on the (3rd). According to prisoners Zhan Hongjiao and others, they were originally old troops of Chen Cheng, captured and serving in the Second Independent Division of the puppet Third Army Corps. The division had the 7th, 8th, and 9th Regiments. The 7th and 8th Regiments arrived after five days of marching from Ruijin and attacked Chongshi Xinwei. After charging eight times and suffering more than a hundred casualties, they retreated at night with the 22nd Division of the puppet Third Army and the Ruijin Model Regiment. The 22nd Division had three regiments, each with four companies, and each company had seventy or eighty rifles with forty or fifty rounds of ammunition per rifle. They arrived after four days of marching from Junmenting. On the morning of the 2nd, they encountered the national army and were bombed and attacked by the national army's hand grenades and light machine guns, suffering three or four hundred casualties. They saw that the national army's strength was too great and that the old fort could not be approached, so they retreated, etc. It was also reported that the bandits retreated in two directions on winter nights, one through Yanghu and one through Jingbei to Jinsha. The whole team had about three thousand remaining bandits, who retreated from Jinsha to Menhe. More than two hundred bandits were wounded and boarded boats at Shuidong. In this battle, the First Column suffered several platoon leader casualties and more than thirty soldier casualties. The Fourth Division of the Second Army has now sent troops to the Guanpu area, which is less than five miles from Anyuan. (9th)</p>
<h3>Songjiang Drives Away Evil Spirits, Burning Ten Fingers</h3>
<p>Luo Rongxing, a resident of Lujia Bridge in the southern gate of this city,</p>
<p>is a tailor. His wife, Luo Jiang, suffers from neurasthenia.</p>
<p>Sometimes she is possessed by evil spirits, and she raves day and night. After waking up, she is physically exhausted, almost like a serious illness. The year before last, her husband learned a method of exorcism and tried it, tightly striking her fingertips with a thread and burning them with moxa, which proved to be surprisingly effective and did not recur for two years. Unexpectedly, recently she suddenly relapsed. Rongxing followed the old method, tying his wife to a pillar and burning her with moxa, locking her in a room. Although she screamed in pain, he did not care. When a neighbor, He Laosan, passed by and heard the terrible screams, he went inside to investigate and saw that all ten fingers had been burned. He immediately released her. Everyone felt resentment at Luo Rongxing's inhumane behavior and reported it to a branch police station for investigation. Yesterday, he was transferred to the county court prosecutor's office for examination of the injuries. The official ordered Luo Rongxing to be detained, but Luo Jiang could not bear to see her husband in prison and only asked that he be ordered to send her to a doctor for treatment. According to reports, Luo Rongxing agreed to treat her in court, and the detention order was revoked. Luo Rongxing has already sent the injured Luo Jiang to the hospital for treatment.</p>

Suddenly, a large panel door flew over and hit his head and chest, causing serious injuries. Zhai Henian, the head of Zhongzheng Township, who runs the Dada Automobile Company, had his five houses swept away by the wind without a trace, and not even a single tile remained. Li San, who pushes a cart, also had his two thatched cottages disappear. At the same time, terrifying waves in the sea were like mountains falling, causing people to feel frightened.

<p>funds from the salt permit surtax, they have not complied, causing financial difficulties for various institutions to reach their limit. After investigation, more than 10,000 yuan is owed for public security, more than 10,000 yuan for education, and more than 30,000 yuan for charity. Representatives were sent to the county government on the 13th to petition, asking that salt merchants be ordered to allocate funds according to the old rules. Kang Shuwu, an important figure among the salt merchants, happened to be at the county on business, so he was invited to the meeting to discuss the allocation of funds. Guo Lanshi, the representative of charity, proposed a motion asking Kang to acknowledge that he would represent the salt merchants in allocating funds as before, ensuring that the goal was fully achieved, and wrote a note to prove it. The representatives were still worried about instability, so Yang Shengwu, Wang Jingting, and Zhu Ganchen acted as guarantors for Kang before they all returned.</p>

<p>Zhang Yigong, also came to Pinghu and stayed at the Tong'an</p>
<p>Hotel on Xiaojie. After one night, he suddenly went somewhere else. Soon, bailiffs went there to clear the room fee and asked him to cancel the lease. Unexpectedly, Zhang went to the hotel that evening and scolded the accountant for renting his No. 25 room to someone else. The accountant pleaded in vain, so he asked the guest in No. 25 to move. The guest was a woman who brought her child to Pinghu for medical treatment. Her child had just taken medicine and fallen asleep and was unwilling to move. Zhang became even more angry and called the county Public Security Bureau to send police to arrest the hotel manager Ling Meiting and accountant Gao Xiang Sheng. After arriving at the bureau, they were transferred to the county government, where County Magistrate Zhang personally opened the court for interrogation, ordering them to be responsible for finding his brother's official documents and other items. Ling and others denied it. The next day, they were released on bail. Ling Meiting was unwilling to accept this humiliation and asked someone to write a petition, appealing to the High Court. Also, Zhang Tiwei, the younger brother of County Magistrate Zhang, came to take office with his brother and served as a mail clerk. Yesterday, citizens Wu Guisen and others accused him of dereliction of duty, greed, and fraud, and reported him to the Judicial Administration Department, the Supervisory Yuan, and the High Court.</p>

We implore you to examine them. In recent days, our three commanders, Ji Hongchang, Deng Wen, and Li Zhongyi, have all personally supervised the battle under the city, attacking fiercely despite heavy losses. Last night, Commander Ji and others personally led a suicide squad, stripped to the waist, to advance. They attempted to scale the city walls three times, but the enemy swept them with machine guns and threw grenades, preventing their success. It is estimated that the battle resulted in over 540 casualties among officers and soldiers below the rank of regimental commander. From 8:00 AM to 9:00 AM, seven enemy aircraft flew in from the east, dropping over 40 bombs, but most missed their targets. At noon, our three commanders, Ji, Deng, and Li, strictly ordered all units to attack fiercely. Until 9:40 AM this morning, our army completely entered Dolun City from the south, north, and west, and engaged in street battles and hand-to-hand combat for three hours. The remaining Japanese and puppet troops finally fled in disarray from the east gate of the city. Our army is currently pursuing them eastward.

<h3>Director of Navigation Department Comes to Shanghai to Thoroughly Investigate the Tunan Incident</h3>
<p>Investigating the Issue of Responsibility in Detail</p>
<p>And Seriously Negotiating with the Japanese Side</p>
<p>Following the collision and sinking of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Tunan ship by the Japanese Dalian Steamship Company's Changchun Maru, the Ministry of Transportation yesterday specially dispatched the Director of the Navigation Department, Gao Tingzi, to Shanghai to thoroughly investigate the issue of responsibility for the incident in order to make serious representations to the Japanese side. According to Gao, the loss of the Tunan ship is limited to the ship itself, while the lives of the crew and passengers, as well as the future safety of Chinese ships, are extremely serious issues. Therefore, the Ministry of Transportation specially sent him to Shanghai to conduct a thorough investigation. If the Japanese ship is responsible, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company will make serious representations in order to protect maritime lives. As for the names and numbers of the crew members, it has been determined that there are 56 crew members, with 29 missing. The number of passenger deaths and losses has yet to be estimated and will be confirmed when the Tianjin Maru arrives in Shanghai. Based on the current investigation, the Japanese Changchun Maru should be held responsible for this unfortunate incident. The location of the collision was in the Shandong waters not far from Qingdao. At that time, the Tunan ship was sailing on a straight line to Tianjin, while the Changchun Maru was sailing on a diagonal line. There is no doubt that the collision was caused by the Changchun Maru's incorrect route. However, the detailed situation will be clarified after the rescued crew members arrive in Shanghai and are questioned.</p>
<h3>Sending Personnel to Care For</h3>
<p>The 89 crew and passengers rescued from the Tunan ship,</p>
<p>are permitted</p>
<p>to come to Shanghai on the Dalian Steamship Company's Tianjin Maru.</p>
<p>The ship departed from Dalian at 1:00 PM yesterday, stopping first at Qingdao, then coming to Shanghai. Yesterday, it was telegraphed that the Tianjin Maru is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at 7:00 AM tomorrow morning. The rescued personnel will disembark at the Huangpu Wharf. Yesterday, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company dispatched eight staff members to the wharf tomorrow morning to care for them. At the same time, Jun'an Society was instructed to temporarily accommodate the sailors and stokers. The passengers will be cared for by Qian Mingshu and others and be ready to meet upon arrival.</p>
<p>[P Salvaging Sunken Funds&gt;</p>
<p>The 39 boxes of silver ingots and</p>
<p>silver dollars inside the ship,</p>
<p>worth more than 200,000</p>
<p>yuan, were loaded in Yantai by the</p>
<p>local Bank of Communications and unfortunately also sank. However, the silver treasures are all covered by marine insurance. The insurance companies are now in agreement to proceed with salvage procedures and are investigating the sea area where the Tunan sank, which is about 50 to 60 feet deep, so it is possible to salvage the silver boxes.</p>

<h3>Mr. Zeng Yijing Returns to Shanghai Yesterday Morning After the Long-Distance Flight Along the Yangtze River</h3>
<p>Discussing the many experiences gained on this trip</p>
<p>Saving the country through aviation requires training talent</p>
<p>The Jiangfeng aircraft's pontoon slightly damaged, already transported to Shanghai</p>
<p>According to Riri News, Zeng Yijing, director of the Naval Aircraft Manufacturing Bureau, departed from Shanghai on the 15th of last month with German pilot Buri on the domestically produced Jiangfeng seaplane trainer for a long-distance flight along the Yangtze River. After reaching Yuezhou, the pontoon was slightly damaged, and it was returned to Hankou for repairs. It was transported back to Shanghai on the Jianguo ship, and Mr. Zeng also took the ship east, arriving at the port at 11:00 AM yesterday morning. A reporter from Riri News specifically went to see Mr. Zeng at the bureau yesterday and learned the following:</p>
<h3>Flight Experience</h3>
<p>According to Mr. Zeng, he promoted</p>
<p>domestically produced aircraft to awaken</p>
<p>his compatriots. In mid-last month, he piloted</p>
<p>the Jiangfeng aircraft on a</p>
<p>long-distance flight along the Yangtze River. This flight was not difficult. When arriving in Zhenjiang, the aircraft's pontoon was slightly damaged, and he immediately telegraphed for workers to come from Shanghai for repairs. He then continued flying, passing through Nanjing, Wuhu, Anqing, Jiujiang, Wuxue, and other places. On the 20th, he arrived in Hankou. Because the current of the Yangtze River was very rapid, reaching a speed of five miles per hour, the connection of the aircraft's pontoon was damaged again. He immediately had it hoisted onto the Weisheng gunboat for repairs, which took three or four days. On the 29th, he flew to Yuezhou. He originally planned to fly to Changsha, reaching Shashi and Yichang. The river flow upstream from Hankou increased by two miles per hour. He reluctantly flew back to Hankou on the 6th of this month. The aircraft was still able to fly with difficulty, but the German pilot, for the sake of caution, did not fly east again. He disassembled the aircraft and transported it back to Shanghai on the Jianguo ship.</p>
<h3>Training Talent</h3>
<p>Mr. Zeng continued, "Although this flight was not fully successful, it should</p>
<p>break the Chinese people's belief in foreign-made aircraft.</p>
<p>Our bureau's domestically produced aircraft has a sturdy fuselage made of steel. Otherwise, it would have been scattered and destroyed by the impact of the river. This trip has provided a lot of experience, and in the future, we will strive to rebuild and seek to strengthen the interior and the pontoon. Then, even if we encounter strong winds and huge waves, we will not be affected. I believe that saving the country through aviation does not lie in simply buying aircraft, but in awakening the general youth who are willing to receive aviation education and provide them with good training. In ten years, our country's aviation will be very promising. Our country's current aviation talents are all flying low-speed aircraft and have no combat skills."</p>
<h3>Continuing to Fly South</h3>
<p>Mr. Zeng also said, "The Jiangfeng aircraft has now been</p>
<p>shipped back for repairs, which should be</p>
<p>completed within two months. After the repairs are completed, it will fly to the</p>
<p>outer port of Wusong as a field test. I am not discouraged and will continue to work hard to make a long-distance flight along the coast. Ningbo, Wenzhou, Fuzhou, and Xiamen all have inland ports where it can be moored. However, we must prepare for any unexpected events, so that if an accident occurs, it can land on the sea.

<h3>Municipal Federation Investigates Committee Reports Counterfeit Goods with Changed Labels</h3>
<p>According to Guowen News Agency, the Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation yesterday reported a report from the National Products Committee Investigation Section stating: In order to strictly investigate unscrupulous merchants who change the labels of counterfeit goods to pass them off as domestic products, it has been found that Ju Da Company has changed the Four Gentlemen brand of counterfeit goods to the Chentangguan brand to pass off as domestic tribute woolen fabric. Furthermore, it was found that the Guangxin Dyeing and Weaving Factory claimed to have changed the Shengji and Chentangguan brands and no longer produces them. However, when inquiring at the factory's wholesale department, employees stated that the Chentangguan brand is a major product. Samples of the existing Chentangguan brand goods were obtained and attached. It is hoped that they will be filed. Since the factory has admitted that the brand is not produced, but the brand's goods are still wholesale in large quantities, this is clear evidence of changing the labels to pass off as domestic products. It is requested that methods be discussed to warn unscrupulous merchants and maintain the integrity of domestic goods.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Investigates Auxiliary Currency in Various Provinces</h3>
<p>When the new currency was issued, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce petitioned the Ministry of Finance to reorganize auxiliary currency. The Ministry of Finance is planning this matter and is starting by investigating the types of auxiliary currency circulating in various provinces. The investigation of the types of auxiliary currency in each province revealed that there are 15 types of bronze, silver, and paper auxiliary currency in Jiangsu. The types of auxiliary currency used in Jiangsu include double silver coins from Guangdong, Jiangnan, Hubei, and Beiyang, while single silver coins are extremely rare. Zhejiang double coins include those from Guangdong and Fujian, while single silver coins are also rare. Anhui is the same as Jiangsu. Jiangxi double coins include those from Guangdong. Most are auxiliary currency notes. Hubei double coins include those from Guangdong, Jiangnan, and Hubei. Single coins include one type of Yuan Shikai. Hunan has very few Guangdong double coins in the south, with no other circulation. Guangdong single and double coins include one type from Guangdong. Guangxi double coins include those from Guangdong and Guangxi, with no single silver coins. Fujian double coins include those from Fujian and Guangdong. Single coins include two types of Yuan Shikai and Guangdong, as well as local one and two silver dollar coins. Guangzhou double coins include two types from Guangdong and Yuan Shikai, and a few half-dollar coins. Yunnan has very few silver auxiliary coins, with most circulation being copper auxiliary coins. Henan has a few Yuan Shikai single silver coins, while double coins are very rare. There are also 200-500 large copper coins each. Shanxi is the same as Henan.

<h3>Inventor of the Latest Explosive, Xi Mo, Will Come to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Also Accompanying Him is Capitalist Joseph</p>
<p>According to the Da Mei Evening News, Xi Chen, the former U.S. Army Captain who invented the latest explosive, Radium A</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>tomite, will arrive here from Japan on the Russian ship on the 16th to demonstrate the effectiveness of his explosive to Chinese military officials. Also accompanying him will be Los Angeles capitalist Joseph. It is claimed that the explosive power of his explosive is four times that of the most powerful explosive currently in use and sixteen times that of ordinary gunpowder. It is also a product of the California Institute of Technology Laboratory. The manufacturing method has been sold by Xi Mo to Joseph. Several months ago, Biamen, a businessman from Los Angeles, came to Shanghai to negotiate the resale of this method to China. He is said to be Joseph's representative. According to a news release from the International News Service in September 1928, when it released news of the patent for this new explosive, it claimed that the explosive had been tested at the U.S. Dover Arsenal. Railroad tracks could be blown up, and large trees could be turned into powder. According to Xi Mo, if a bomb containing this explosive were dropped from an aircraft, all the houses in the entire city could be destroyed. If a</p>
<p>torpedo was loaded with 400 pounds of this explosive, it would be enough to sink a battleship. According to Biamen, this explosive can be manufactured using domestic raw materials from China, and does not require imported nitrates or other chemicals. It can be manufactured in as little as 24 hours and can be used in another 24 hours, and there is no flash of light when it detonates.</p>
<h3>Naming Ceremony for the Tianchu Aircraft Postponed</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the China Aviation Association issued an urgent notice regarding the postponement of the naming ceremony for the Tianchu aircraft. The original naming ceremony for the Tianchu aircraft was scheduled to be held at the Hongqiao Airfield at 3:00 PM on the 16th of this month. Due to the preparations not being fully completed, it has been postponed. Once the preparations are completed, a new date will be announced. However, the issued invitations and admission tickets will still be valid at that time. This is a special notice.</p>
<p>Xu Peigen, Director of the Aviation Department of the Ministry of Military Affairs, took the overnight express train from Beijing last night to Shanghai to participate as a sign of respect. Jiang Mao Bangchu, the head of the aviation school, also sent two Junkers fighter planes to Shanghai to perform combat maneuvers and welcome the Tianchu aircraft back to the team. The two aircraft arrived at the Hongqiao Airfield in western Shanghai at 10:15 AM yesterday. Lin Wojiang, Secretary-General of the China Aviation Association, and the association's staff welcomed them at the airfield.</p>
<h3>Rubber Factories Strive to Improve</h3>
<p>In order to improve the safety and health equipment of various rubber factories in this city, the Municipal Industrial Safety Association has organized a special rubber industry safety committee to study improvement methods and formulate recommendations for the factories to adopt. In recent days, the association has been soliciting the opinions of experts and sending personnel to inspect the actual situation of various factories for reference. A draft recommendation on fire and explosion prevention has been drafted and is scheduled to be discussed at a meeting with various rubber factories at the Rubber Industry Association of the Trade on Pingwang Street at 3:00 PM tomorrow (the 16th). After collecting opinions from all parties, the committee will make a final decision in order to help the factories plan improvements as soon as possible. In order to make the factories pay attention to equipment improvement, the association publishes a monthly industrial safety bulletin. The first issue of the first volume was published on the first of this month, with content such as Pan Gongzhan's "Industrial Safety and Factory Inspection," Zhu Maocheng's "Factory Safety," Li Pingheng's "Soviet Labor Administration," and Tian Heqing's "Implementation Plan for Industrial Safety Movement," which are quite useful as a reference for factory safety equipment.</p>
<p>According to a message from the Municipal Council's Intelligence Office, the Municipal Council recently notified a rubber factory to immediately prevent a certain dangerous situation. The factory replied to the Municipal Council, requesting that personnel be sent to the factory to instruct on the necessary measures so that they can be implemented immediately to avoid danger. It can be seen that some factory owners do have the intention of striving for safety. In addition, workers at a rubber factory jointly wrote a letter requesting the police station to order the factory to quickly install safety equipment to protect the safety of the workers.</p>
<h3>Silk Factory Workers in the Concession Resume Work Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Negotiations on Wage Issues at the Shuanggong Factory Fail to Reach a Result</p>
<p>Due to the factory's agreement to pay back wages, all workers in the silk factory strike in the concession area of this city resumed work as usual yesterday morning. Workers at the Fulun Shuanggong Factory at the end of Hongri Tianbao Road continued to strike yesterday. The details are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>Resumption of Work in the Concession Approximately 2,000 workers from the five factories in the concession area, namely Yuanhe, Chunji, Jingwei, Taichang on Alabastor Road, Xiangyuan on Gansu Road, and Qianyu on Manzhou Road, believed that the June wages of 45 cents per day violated the social mediation decision, causing a backlash. They announced a strike one after another the day before yesterday. The Second District Silk Workers Union sent personnel to negotiate, and the factories agreed to uniformly pay the outstanding five cents for June on the 16th of this month. Yesterday morning at 4:30 AM, Yang Shumei, Chen Lianxi, Cui Abao, A San, and others from the Third District Silk Workers Union went to various factories to persuade them to resume work. At that time, many workers gathered at the factory gates and were unwilling to enter the factory to work, stating that they would only resume work if the outstanding five cents for June were paid in full that day. The Third District Silk Workers Union feared that the dispute would be prolonged, and after consulting with the factory owners, the factory owners agreed. Therefore, the workers of each factory gradually entered the factory to resume work.</p>
<p>Shuanggong Remains Suspended More than 500 workers at the Fulun Shuanggong Silk Factory at the end of Hongkou Tianbao Road recently requested that wages be set at 50 cents per day, in accordance with the single-factory wage system. However, the factory did not allow it because the production of silk at the Shuanggong factory was simple and the selling price was low. Because the workers had not obtained their demands, they suddenly went on strike the day before yesterday (the 12th). Yesterday morning, directors Chen Xiupu and Lu Xusheng went to the factory to discuss a solution with manager Shen Zubei. The factory stated that the output of the Shuanggong factory was of poor quality and the selling price was low. If wages were paid according to the single-factory wage system, it would be difficult to maintain. However, it agreed to increase wages by two cents per day, changing it to 47 cents. However, the workers insisted on 50 cents per day, resulting in no result. All workers continued to strike yesterday, and it is feared that a resolution will be difficult to achieve.</p>
<h3>Case of American-Asian Company Forced to Stop Night Work</h3>
<p>Already the Municipal Government Negotiating with the French Consulate</p>
<p>And Sending Letters to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Federation of Labor for Assistance</p>
<p>The case of the Mei-Ya Ninth Weaving and Dyeing Factory on Xujiahui Road in the French Concession being ordered to stop night work by the French Municipal Council was yesterday reported to the Municipal Government and the Bureau of Social Affairs by the Shanghai Electrical Machinery and Silk Industry Association. They urged a swift and serious negotiation with the French Consul-General, and also sent letters to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Chinese Industrial Federation, requesting them to find ways to provide assistance in order to avoid destroying national goods factories and safeguarding labor administration. The original letter to the Municipal Government reads as follows: “We are reporting on the illegal order by the French Municipal Council to stop night work at the Mei-Ya Ninth Weaving and Dyeing Factory, a member of our association, which is causing losses to the factory's business and hindering the livelihood of workers. We are reporting the situation and urging negotiations to stop it. Our association received a letter from the member Mei-Ya Weaving and Dyeing Factory on the 8th of this month (omitted, see previous report in this newspaper) and so on. Based on this, we have investigated and found that the factory has been in operation for a long time, located in a remote area in the western suburbs of Shanghai, with very few nearby residents. Moreover, when the factory was established, it was inspected and approved by the French Works Department. The factory's night work has been in place for a long time. Residents who moved here later should have considered this themselves. Having moved in, how can they force the factory that was here first to stop working? The French Municipal Council's abrupt order to Mei-Ya to stop night work, citing disturbance to the sleep of nearby residents, is completely unreasonable. The factory pays taxes and operates lawfully in the French Concession. The French Municipal Council does not provide reasonable protection but instead indulges in illegal destruction, which is outrageous. While the Municipal Government is in the process of negotiating the management rights of factories in the concession, the French Concession Municipal Council is taking the lead in overstepping its authority. It has already ordered the Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory to relocate and now orders Mei-Ya Silk Factory to stop night work. Its intention to damage our national goods industry is clearly sinister. Mei-Ya Silk Factory has suffered considerable losses due to this oppression, and the relationship to the infringement of our labor administrative rights is also very significant. In view of the above, we have prepared a document and respectfully request Your Excellency's review and approval, and urge you to swiftly negotiate with the French Consul-General, ordering the French Municipal Council to stop this action so as to secure industry and assert national rights. We are awaiting your orders with utmost urgency.”</p>
<p>[P Zhu Jiqing's Report on the Battle Situation&gt;</p>
<p>The situation of the National Salvation Army under Zhu Jiqing's command fighting against the Japanese in Rehe has been repeatedly reported in the press. Here are excerpts from telegrams from the front lines: ㈠□Secret, Respectful Greetings to the Director-General, (A) This time, the Japanese and puppet troops are attacking from four directions, which can be considered a major planned offensive.</p>
<p>However, in three days of fierce fighting, only one Japanese aircraft came to harass us once. We do not understand why. (B) According to Li Shuzhen's report, the enemy coming from the east was led by the traitor Li Rongjiu. It was extremely secretive beforehand. We only engaged in a hasty defense after reaching Gangyao Ridge. The People's Association did not participate at first, so the enemy went straight to Doma Camp, Yu family, and Sanjia Yu family. Only when innocent people were burned and killed did the public become aroused and united to resist the war. The enemy was finally defeated. (The rest omitted) Respectful Greetings from Zhi Ting ㈡□Secret, Respectful Greetings to the Director-General, (A) Wang Zhen, Zhao Qingquan, and others are on the northern front, Zhao Wansan, Zhao Shangde, and others are on the western front, Liu Huanzhang, Shao Wenhai, Sun Qingwen, and others are on the southern front, and Li Shuzhen and others are on the eastern front, with approximately 2,000 to 3,000 people on each front. (B) The defeat on the northern front, near Shuangmiao, was due to the forced conscription of militia, recruiting people village by village. A man named Zhang refused and three people were killed, arousing public resentment. (C) On the southern front, there were reports of an invasion of Sanjiaocheng Yu. Last night, the People's Associations from the southwest and west heard the news and went to intercept them. (D) In recent days, People's Associations from various places have gathered. According to people from Chaoyang, there are rumors in the city that the People's Associations are still attacking Chaoyang, causing panic. The enemy has automatically demolished the newly built bridge over the Daling River at the south gate.

(B) The enemy who retreated from Shuangmiao launched a counterattack starting at 10 a.m. this morning. In Yuche and Ludian, our Wang, Chen Gui, and other troops and the People's Association rose up to meet them. The sound of artillery was deafening. After four hours of fierce fighting, the enemy was already surrounded by us at the time of this telegram. (C) The enemy who advanced to Sanjiaocheng Yu on the southern front withdrew automatically this morning upon hearing that the People's Association was rushing to their aid.

<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Again Telegrams the Executive Yuan to Maintain the Credit of the Arsenal's Mortgage Loan</h3>
<p>National Debt Not Based on Civil Law Provisions</p>
<p>Is Truly Contrary to the Spirit of the Rule of Law</p>
<p>Xin Sheng She reports that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has again presented a case to the Executive Yuan to fight for the arsenal mortgage loan case. The letter is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Chen Yi's Reply</h3>
<p>Xiaolai, my dear friend, I received your letter of June 17, and have understood everything in detail. Upon investigation, there was a previous established case and there was no objection. Moreover, the merchants advanced a large sum of money, and the circumstances at the time were compelling. Therefore, their creditor rights and interests should be maintained. However, what needs to be reviewed is whether the debts owed as a result of the previous warlord infighting should be used as collateral for central government property. In summary, this case involves two issues: the mortgage and the debt. It concerns the authority of two ministries and has been reported to the Executive Yuan for submission to the Executive Conference for a decision. This is my reply.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce's Petition</h3>
<p>To the Nanjing Executive Yuan: This chamber has reported that the mortgage rights of the Shanghai Arsenal base cannot be unilaterally denied according to law. On the 13th of this month, we received a reply from Vice Minister Chen of the Ministry of Military Affairs to Chairman Wang Xiaolai of this chamber (original text see previous report). After carefully reading it, we were even more shocked and astonished. The Ministry initially stated that the factory property belonged to the Ministry and could not be disposed of by local officials. However, when this chamber reported that the mortgage had been approved by the then Ministries of Finance and Army, the Ministry changed its tune again, saying that whether the debts of warlord infighting should be used as collateral for central government property was being questioned. In every possible way, they wanted to use administrative procedures to cancel the legally established mortgage contract. The state is not handling debt contracts in accordance with the provisions of the Civil Law, but instead resorting to administrative measures, hoping to use this to undermine the equal relationship between the parties so that they can dispose of the property freely. This is contrary to the spirit of the rule of law. Therefore, this chamber finds it difficult to accept the Ministry's intention to decide the existence or abolition of the mortgage contract through an administrative meeting. The taxes paid by the people during the era of warlord rule were all central government revenue. If we were to follow this logic, then all donations and taxes paid before the 16th year of the Republic would inevitably be invalid in order to be consistent in theory. In terms of the mortgage right itself, were the public bonds and treasury bills issued by the Beijing government not used for military expenses? Everyone knows that this is not the case. What guarantee was used for the tariff on bonds and treasury bills, and was not the tariff also central government property? How is it different from the arsenal base? Yet, one is being continuously fulfilled, while the other is being overturned. The treatment of debts from the same era of warlords can be so different, leading observers to suspect that there is no standard for right and wrong, and that judgments are based solely on the intentions of the authorities. This will further damage the state's clear governance. These advances, which were supposed to be secured, have not only not been repaid with principal and interest after ten years, but even the issue of whether the contract exists or not is still in dispute. Now, the Ministry claims on the one hand that it will maintain the interests of creditors, while on the other hand, it doubts whether the factory property should be used as collateral. If that is the case, it is tantamount to turning secured debt into unsecured debt. Taking today's 96 Bonds as an example, although the government has not issued a document to cancel or deny them, the principal and interest have not been paid, and they have long been in a state of limbo. I fear that the Ministry's so-called maintenance of creditors' interests will not be enough to reassure the creditors, and will be criticized as simply being empty words. As the chamber that handled this matter, we have no way to defend ourselves. Therefore, maintaining the interests of creditors and maintaining the mortgage are essentially the same thing, and it is difficult to separate them into two. Now, we are again telegraphing Your Yuan to request that you review and approve that we do not seek so-called ways to maintain creditors' rights other than destroying the contract, so as to demonstrate the state's clear governance. This would be most fortunate. Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce respectfully bows. Yuan.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Advocates Universal Cancellation of Telephone Charges between Chinese and Concession Areas</h3>
<p>Letter to the Works Department's Chinese Directors Urging Vigorous Promotion</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce believes that every time telephones are used between the Chinese and Concession areas, a fee of five cents must be paid. The procedure is complicated and the burden on citizens is heavy. Therefore, yesterday it sent separate letters to the Shanghai Telephone Bureau and the Concession Telephone Company, requesting that the telephone charges be universally cancelled as soon as possible. At the same time, it also sent letters to the Chinese Directors of the Works Department, Yu Qiaqing, Xu Xinliu, Yuan Ludeng, etc., urging them to vigorously promote this matter during the meeting. The two letters are recorded separately below:</p>
<h3>Letter to the Telephone Bureau</h3>
<p>Dear Sirs, Regarding calls between the Chinese area telephone and the Concession telephone in this city, a telephone charge of five cents must be paid for every three minutes. This type of call within the same area requires users to bear an additional obligation to pay fees each time, in addition to the rent they should pay. This increases the burden on users. This is unreasonable and is an unprecedented example in various countries. Telephone users have always believed that this method was an expedient measure when manual switchboards were used at the time. It was originally hoped that the automatic switchboard would be upgraded in the future and that this fee would be cancelled. Now that your bureau has upgraded to an automatic switchboard, there is only a proposal to increase the price, and the method of charging five cents per call is still being implemented, which increases the burden on users and causes resentment. It does not seem to be a way for the company to take care of its users. When our association discussed with your bureau about not increasing the phone price, we also promised to find a way to cancel this matter. Recently, we have read in the newspapers that your bureau also has expressed its intention to automatically cancel this matter in the near future, which is a great relief to the public. However, we have not yet seen its effective implementation. We hereby send this letter to request that you investigate and decisively abolish the method of collecting five cents per call, so as to respond to the public's expectations. We look forward to it.</p>
<h3>Letter to the Chinese Directors</h3>
<p>Dear Sirs, Regarding the fact that telephone calls between the Chinese and Concession areas have always been charged a telephone fee of five cents, the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, in order to reduce the burden on citizens, has repeatedly negotiated to cancel the telephone fee. However, it has not been implemented because it has not been approved by the Shanghai Telephone Company. It should be noted that the telephone lines between the Chinese and Concession areas have already been formally connected, and there is no obstruction to calls between them. The telephone fee is not necessary. We hereby send this letter to request that you consider proposing to cancel the aforementioned telephone fee of five cents at the same time as the Chinese area at the Board of Directors meeting of the Works Department, so as to benefit users. We will be deeply grateful.</p>
<h3>Two Railroads Sending Personnel to Negotiate Business Transportation</h3>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Notifies Members</p>
<p>Zheng Shizhao, the head of the traffic departments of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways, in order to understand market conditions, develop business, and facilitate passengers and merchants, has specially appointed several railway personnel to go to various places to be responsible for contacting and soliciting freight business. Yesterday, he sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce requesting assistance. The Chamber of Commerce believes that the traffic departments of the two railroads have reformed their traffic operations and facilitated merchants. Yesterday, it specially prepared a letter to notify all industry association members and store members that if any personnel with certificates from the railroad bureau come to negotiate, please receive them.</p>
<h3>The Dispute over Shangbao Tobacco and Alcohol Licenses is Resolved</h3>
<p>丨 Still Handled According to Previous Rules 丨</p>
<p>The Shangbao Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax Collection Office has wanted to collect twice the amount since Ding Xie took over this year. After hearing the news, the tobacco and alcohol industries in this city rose up in opposition. The industry associations sent personnel to negotiate repeatedly. As a result, the office agreed to follow the old rules. The industry was satisfied. However, a few days ago, Renxing on Xibaoxing Road in Zhabei and Dashenchang on Fangxie Road in Nanshi and other stores were ordered to bring their licenses to the office to pay taxes and exchange them for new licenses. A certain collection director from the north and south offices detained the licenses, asking for four yuan for a license worth two yuan, almost causing a dispute. Fortunately, Teng Zhixiang and Tong Lingyun, the director of the Shanghai North Branch of the Tobacco Industry Association, went to the tax office to negotiate. Director Ding explained that it was a misunderstanding and promised to instruct the staff to handle the matter according to the previous practice and not to harass them again. The dispute was immediately resolved.</p>

<h3>Lawyers Association Petitions for Protection of Lawyer Wang Shuchiao</h3>
<p>Regarding his Brother Wang Yaqiao's Affair</p>
<p>Has Already Published a Statement in the Newspaper Severing Ties</p>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers Association sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Government, stating, "Dear Sirs, According to reports in the newspaper on the 9th of this month, lawyer Wang Shuchiao was suspected by the captured criminal Zhou Zhizhang of involvement in the assassination case of Tie Qiao, and was being held at the Shanghai First Special District District Court. The Municipal Public Security Bureau under your government has also sent a detective officer, team leader Gao Wansheng, to the court to request a transfer. Because the case has not progressed, the official document has not been submitted." "Lawyer Wang Shuchiao is a member of our association and has always been law-abiding and does not participate in external affairs since he started working as a lawyer. When the Zhao case occurred in July and August of the 19th year of the Republic, lawyer Wang Shuchiao was still living and studying at school during the Hassei era. Especially, he has no relation with any parties of society. After the news that he was framed was published in the newspapers, our association received repeated letters from Legislative Yuan member Zhao Chen and Executive Committee Alternate Tang Hao, Supervisory Committee Alternate, Tong Shi Ying, etc. who were raised at the meeting and then submitted to the 143rd Joint Meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees. After careful deliberation, it was unanimously agreed that the Zhao case had been investigated by the Public Concession Bureau and had been sent to the First Special District District Court for questioning twice. There were legal procedures to follow. Lawyer Wang was implicated for no reason and the truth would soon come to light. We should quietly wait for the judicial authorities to resolve the matter according to law, and our association should not express any opinion. It is suspicious why the Municipal Public Security Bureau is applying to the court to transfer him. It is worth mentioning that our association received a report from lawyer Wang on January 27 of this year, stating that on the 22nd of this month, a large number of detectives from the French Police Station suddenly entered and searched his residence at No. 351, Ladou Road in the French Concession, preventing people from entering and leaving until 6 p.m. the night before. It is rumored that this was initiated by the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, and the bureau's note to the police station was in the name of checking the family of his brother Yaqiao. In fact, the member and his brother have long been living separately. His brother is viewed with suspicion by the authorities due to political relations. As a member, he has never engaged in any illegal activities. Whether in terms of law or reason, the Chinese and Concession authorities should not arbitrarily involve him or accuse him of crimes." "On the 31st, he received another report stating that according to rumors from outside, plainclothes detectives sent by the Shanghai Municipal Government Security Office, Public Security Bureau, and other agencies planned to take special measures to take the members to the Chinese area without notifying the police station, so as to force him to reveal the whereabouts of his brother. Although these rumors are not credible, there are still people resembling detectives patrolling near his residence, and servants are interrogated every time they enter and leave. It is evident that they have special purposes, and the members' bodies and families are in danger of being harmed. Thinking of this, he could not help but shudder. Considering that the member has been exclusively engaged in lawyer business since graduating from school, he has never participated in any political movements, and he has been living separately from his brother Yaqiao for a long time. Their actions are not known to each other. In terms of law and fact, Shuchiao is absolutely not jointly liable for his brother's actions. All of these matters can be reviewed. Even if Wang Yaqiao is suspected of committing a crime, it is clearly irrelevant to his brother, lawyer Wang Shuchiao. Moreover, according to the principle of no implication of family members, even though lawyer Wang is Wang Yaqiao's brother, he bears absolutely no responsibility for any crimes. How can he be arbitrarily implicated and arrested? The Municipal Public Security Bureau's application for transfer this time is inappropriate and should be protected by our association upon sending a letter to your government to inform its subordinate agencies." "Subsequently, on March 30, we received a reply stating that the Municipal Public Security Bureau reported that it had not sent anyone to spy on or search lawyer Wang Shuchiao's office, etc., which are all on file. Although the Municipal Public Security Bureau has issued a statement regarding the search of lawyer Wang's residence, the Chinese and Concession authorities believe that Wang Yaqiao's crimes are serious and have been unable to apprehend him. They are trying to detain his brother by any means to find out his brother's whereabouts in order to arrest him. The facts are clear and cannot be denied. However, our association believes that although lawyer Wang Shuchiao and Wang Yaqiao are brothers, one is nearly 50 years old while the other is only 26. There is a significant age difference. One is accustomed to revolutionary life, while the other is usually very careful and speaks gently. They are indeed conservative and law-abiding. Their personalities are also very different. They have been living separately for a long time and their actions have never been planned together. Several years ago, lawyer Wang once published a statement in the newspaper severing his brotherly relationship with Wang Yaqiao. All of these matters can be reviewed. Even if Wang Yaqiao is suspected of committing a crime, it is clearly irrelevant to his brother, lawyer Wang Shuchiao. Moreover, according to the principle of no implication of family members, even though lawyer Wang is Wang Yaqiao's brother, he bears absolutely no responsibility for any crimes. How can he be arbitrarily implicated and arrested? The Municipal Public Security Bureau's application for transfer this time is inappropriate and should be protected by our association upon sending a letter to your government to inform its subordinate agencies. The discussion was recorded on file. We hereby present the case and respectfully request your review and approval, adhering to the principle of fairness, and handling it according to the previous order No. 4538 of your government, protecting him and not transferring him. This would be convenient for the law." Sincerely, Shanghai Municipal Government.</p>
<h3>Western and Chinese Police Illegally Exercising Authority Beyond Borders</h3>
<p>Taxpayers Association Sends Letter to the Works Department for Strict Investigation</p>
<p>The Shanghai Concession Taxpayers Association sent a letter to the Director-General of the Shanghai Public Concession Works Department yesterday, stating, "Dear Sirs, According to a letter from the 25th Branch of the Shanghai Citizens Federation, the member Hu Changyong, of the Global Hotel, No. 28 Chongye Lane, North Sichuan Road, stated, 'Tonight (8th) around 9 o'clock, three Italian sailors arrived by rickshaw from Broadway Road. When they got off the rickshaw, the rickshaw driver's dirty hand stained the sailor's white uniform, causing the sailor to become angry and refuse to pay the rickshaw fare. After the member mediated and advised him, the sailor gave him six jiao. The rickshaw driver argued endlessly. The member, thinking that the rickshaw driver was struggling to make a living, again advised the sailor to add three jiao, totaling nine jiao. The rickshaw driver insisted on one yuan before he would give up. However, while he was mediating, a Western policeman No. 44 and a Chinese policeman No. 950 from the Public Concession Police Station suddenly arrived and beat him with hard wooden batons without asking any questions. The member replied that this was under the jurisdiction of the Public Security Bureau and was purely within the scope of the Public Security Bureau police, but the Western policeman continued to beat him indiscriminately, and the Chinese policeman also helped in the assault, causing him to suffer serious injuries all over his body. When passersby called for the police from the Public Security Bureau, the two Western and Chinese policemen, seeing that they had caused trouble, retreated into the Concession. The member then went to the 5th District Office of the Public Security Bureau to report, and Director Liang instructed the police to accompany him to Fumin Hospital to examine his injuries. The injury certificate is now kept in the 5th District Office. The true facts are reported to the association, requesting serious negotiations with the police station, demanding punishment of the perpetrators and compensation to deter others.' Based on this, the member was injured more than five zhang beyond the extraterritorial road construction, and the policeman's actions were beyond the scope of jurisdiction, exercising illegal powers, which is extremely unjustified. Therefore, we hereby send a letter to your association requesting assistance, and raising a serious negotiation with the Public Concession Works Department, so as to attach importance to national rights. "The Western policeman and others exercised illegal powers outside the scope of the Concession police jurisdiction, causing serious injury to the victim. Although this kind of frivolous action has no other effect, it is very easy to cause public compensation. According to the previous reasons in the letter, we hereby send a letter requesting that you investigate the incident quickly and strictly investigate the police who caused the incident, and give generous compensation to the victim, so as to rectify police discipline and promote friendship. It is requested."</p>
<h3>General Overview of Silk and Tea Production and Sales in Zhejiang and Anhui</h3>
<p>This year's summer cocoons from various parts of Zhejiang Province, transported by the Hangzhou Railway, were shipped by the Huitong Company starting on the 29th of last month. Up to yesterday, there were about four thousand bales. There are still more than one thousand bales, which must be shipped to the end of the day. It is estimated that there are already spring cocoons, which have already been completed, a total of only six thousand bales, including summer cocoons, which is a decrease of six tenths compared to previous years. It has also been found that this year's Zhejiang and Anhui box tea is currently in the peak transportation season. It has been shipped since May, and has been reported to Shanghai through the Gate Station, and as of yesterday, there were 97,058 bales unloaded at the South Station, and more than 10,000 boxes at the North Station, all of which were inspected and released by customs officials. They were transported by truck to the Yuanji Foreign Warehouse on the Suzhou River for storage, and then gradually declared for export, mainly selling to foreign countries. It is reported that the estimated number of these goods is at least 200,000 boxes.</p>
<h3>Report on the Survey and Acceptance of the Repair of Fu Gong Embankment in Huai'an</h3>
<p>Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Relief Association and Jiangsu Disaster Prevention Association Cooperate</p>
<p>In Huai'an County, Jiangbei, there is an embankment built by Prefect Tai in the Former Qing Dynasty. The people were grateful and named it Fu Gong Embankment. It is dedicated to resisting the waters of the Hongze, Baima, and Shiying Lakes, protecting 8,000 acres of fertile land and the lives of 100,000 people. It collapsed two years ago due to rising water and has not been repaired. This spring, the accumulated snow was very deep and summer floods are expected to be severe. Therefore, in March, the Chinese and Foreign Relief Association of this port raised 30,000 yuan and the Jiangsu Disaster Prevention Association allocated 10,000 yuan to repair it together. The project was entrusted to Wang Shuxiang and Tian Luyu to preside over, and it has been completed after three months. County Magistrate Zhang Zanxun of Huai'an County has accepted the report. The original text is recorded below: "On the night of June 18th, we received a telegram from your association stating that the Fu Embankment construction has been completed and that you requested us to conduct a nearby inspection and prepare the original and duplicate receipts, which were delivered to the two directors, Wang and Tian, to be sent to the association. We visited the Huayang Yizhenghui Jiangsu Disaster Prevention Association, etc. because the county magistrate went to inspect on the 24th. It was found that the main work of the Fu Gong Embankment, from the Zhenhu Bridge in the first section to the Shihandong in the 51st section, was 3,737 zhang and six cun long. The original plan for the new embankment was to have a top height of one zhang and three chi four cun and a width of one zhang. The new slope should be one wu inside and two wu outside. This survey found that the top width was at least one zhang and five cun, and most of them were one zhang and two chi, and some even reached one zhang and three chi. The height and slope were no less than the original plan. Moreover, the auxiliary works from the end of the Fu Embankment Shihandong, west to Sunzhuang, totaled ten sections, with a total length of 2,250 zhang. The length, width, height, and depth were also found to be consistent with the original plan. I have investigated that the Fu Gong Embankment externally defends against the waters of the Baima, Bao Ying, and Guangzhu Lakes, and internally protects thousands of acres of land in Huai and Huai counties. It is the largest embankment in Jiangbei. The new project is a total of 5,987 zhang long, with a total of 55,280 square meters of earth (the main project of the Fu Embankment accounts for two-thirds of the water area, and it takes three or four people to take one side of the soil in the water every day). A total of 121,000 man-days were recruited (construction started on April 2 and was completed on the 16th, with an average of 1,600 man-days per day). If laborers were hired, it would cost 40,000 to 50,000 yuan. It is now reported that the construction bureau only used more than 22,000 yuan including administrative fees. The new embankment is more than 30 li long, wide, high, and deep, and is uniform. According to the local elders, since the establishment of the Fu Embankment, there has never been such a high, wide, and solid one. Even if there is another 20 years of floods, it will be safe. The people will celebrate a new life forever, which is due to the kindness of your association. Director Wang Shuxiang was in charge of the construction and worked hard, and his perseverance and enthusiasm were admired by the people. Deputy Director Tian Luyu, who is over seventy years old, stayed at the construction site for three months, supervising and inspecting the project, experiencing hardships to complete the entire project, which is difficult for ordinary people to do. The supervising staff sent by the team leader also performed their duties diligently, and they did not disappoint the trust of your association, so they were able to accomplish this immortal feat together. Now, we are fortunate to see its completion and receive the telegram for inspection and acceptance. We are very grateful and respectfully represent the half-million disaster victims from five, six, and seven villages to thank you. In addition to preparing four original and duplicate receipts, which have been delivered to the two directors, Wang and Tian, we have reported the reasons for the telegram and the actual situation of the inspection and acceptance of the Fu Embankment. We have also enclosed a clear list of the new construction measurement尺交 delivered by the construction bureau for your review and approval."</p>
<h3>Yanjing University Alumni Association Welcomes Leighton Stuart</h3>

<h3>Convenience for Passengers on Both Railways</h3>
<p>丨Adding Chinese Food Sales to Passenger Cars丨</p>
<p>To provide convenience for passengers, the Ministry of Railways plans to add Chinese cuisine options to passenger cars on various railway lines. It has instructed both railway bureaus to order their traffic departments to quickly prepare. However, implementing this fully at once would require renovating kitchen cars, which would take time and money. To ensure practical and swift implementation, it is proposed to pilot this on the four daily special express trains with the highest passenger volume on both lines. Meanwhile, plans are still underway to implement this on all trains, and six articles of implementation measures have been drafted. In addition to submitting these to the ministry for approval, instructions have been issued to first add as much Chinese-style food and drink as possible before the pilot implementation. All preparations should be completed quickly for realization. To facilitate implementation, it is planned to start with the 4th and 1st special express trains departing in the morning on the Shanghai-Nanjing line, and the 2nd and 31st special express trains departing in the morning on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line. After achieving success, this will be gradually expanded to all trains. The existing kitchen spaces in the current dining cars are not suitable for selling Chinese food. The existing kitchen cars are at one end of the first-class cars, and their equipment is only suitable for preparing Western food, making it difficult to prepare Chinese food. It is planned to re-plan and renovate the kitchen spaces of four existing dining cars for this purpose. However, before the kitchen car renovations are completed, to meet the need, efforts will be made to attach two dining cars to each Jinghu special express train on both lines to temporarily provide Chinese and Western food. Also, Chinese cooking stoves are different from Western cooking stoves. It is planned to imitate the iron stove methods of Shanghai restaurants and hire workers to package them separately. Chinese cooking utensils are more complex than Western cooking utensils, requiring a total procurement cost of about 50 yuan per train. The ministry's specified utensils will be manufactured and applied in the same style. The methods for purchasing the above urgently needed utensils will be jointly reviewed and handled by the audit, materials, and traffic departments to ensure speed and practicality.</p>
<h3>Bombing of the He'an Sunken Ship</h3>
<p>The He'an ship, which sank in the Gaoqiao Sha New Waterway, is located in an area that is a necessary route for navigation. The customs authorities have contacted the shipping company multiple times. The shipowner of the He'an has decided to abandon salvage rights. The Jianghai Customs is now carrying out bombing to clear the waterway and avoid danger. All shipping companies are hereby notified that any merchant ships passing through this area must navigate extra slowly in the coming days to avoid the danger of the bombing.</p>
<h3>Change of Head of Shanghai-Baoshan Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau</h3>
<p>Zhou Xianjue, the director of the Jiangsu Shanghai-Baoshan Tobacco and Alcohol Tax and Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax Collection Sub-Bureau, has been approved to resign. Huang Yong has been appointed as the new director. The next day after taking office, he appointed Hua Jinzhang as the chief of the local yellow wine tax collection, Zhu Shaoqi as the chief of Shaoxing wine tax collection, and Li Ming as the chief of white wine tax collection. Each is responsible for collecting taxes in accordance with the new regulations. After being appointed, the three chiefs have established collection offices at 265 Maojia Lane in the South Market.</p>
<p>Yesterday, all local yellow wine, white wine, and Shaoxing wine merchants in Shanghai and Baoshan counties were notified to comply with the new regulations and pay taxes as required, without any concealment or evasion, or face penalties.</p>
<h3>Zhabei District Fire Brigade Strives for Fire Safety</h3>
<p>丨New Chinese Area Telephone Installed: 42255丨</p>
<p>The Zhabei District Section 3 Fire Brigade in this port has been established for more than twenty years and has made significant achievements in protecting the lives and property of citizens. Whenever the brigade hears of a fire, it immediately determines the address, dispatches vehicles, rushes to the scene, and makes every effort to rescue and extinguish the fire. To achieve this goal, it has long been praised by all sectors of Zhabei for its bravery and efforts. However, the brigade's area is adjacent to the concession, with many shops and dense populations, making it constantly worrisome. The brigade originally had a Chinese area telephone with the number 42255. It is now reported that the brigade director, to quickly communicate fire alarms in both the Chinese and foreign areas, has installed a concession telephone with the number 45588. If there are any fires or other incidents in the Chinese or foreign areas, the brigade should be notified using the above telephone numbers, and it will immediately determine the location, dispatch vehicles, and rush to the rescue. If there are any lawless individuals who falsely report fires, such behavior will disrupt fire safety. Their origins will be investigated and reported to the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau Chief for strict detention in accordance with the Regulations on Endangering Public Security to maintain fire safety and ensure local peace.</p>
<h3>Chinese Relief Association Schedules Large-Scale Epidemic Prevention Campaign</h3>
<p>The Chinese Relief Association, due to the prevalence of seasonal epidemics in the summer, which are of great concern, specifically resolved at its 108th standing meeting to schedule a large-scale epidemic prevention campaign to promote epidemic prevention methods, provide guidance on emergency treatment, and organize twelve epidemic prevention teams to go to nearby counties and cities to conduct extensive publicity, distribute various epidemic prevention drugs, and administer cholera vaccinations. Everything is now being prepared. Bao Dounan, Xu Huiren, Pu Yingxian, Zheng Xiaolin, Chen Angui, Chu Tongyin, Yu Zhisong, Wang Wenrui, Xu Yici, Xu Shaofen, Song Pinfang, Shen Yufu, Tao Sujuan, Shen Yurui, and Ma Yuqing have been appointed as members of the preparatory committee. People from all walks of life are welcome to participate, and epidemic prevention supplies from major pharmacies are being collected for distribution. Those who are willing to contribute generously can go to the association's general office at the intersection of Racecourse Road and Longmen Road to register their merits.</p>

<h3>Suspect Chen Bocun Further Apprehended in the Assassination of Ma Shaowu</h3>
<p>＝Arrest Reported by Chou Ya-hsiung Who Was Previously Detained＝</p>
<p>Whether Chen Bocun is involved in the assassination needs detailed investigation.</p>
<p>Ma Shaowu, an inspector of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, was hosting a banquet at the home of a prostitute named Tian Xin in the Xiaohuayuan of Zhejiang Road on the night of June 14 this year. Just as Ma's car arrived at the entrance of the lane and was about to enter, he was assassinated. Afterwards, detectives from both the Chinese and Concession areas made every effort to apprehend the culprit and arrested a man named Chou Ya-hsiung. The investigation revealed no supporting evidence, so he was released. After Chou regained his freedom, he met a friend named Zhou Ziliang, who mentioned the matter. Zhou said that a</p>
<h3>Sichuanese Man Chen Bocun</h3>
<p>was highly suspected in the case. Chou then focused on tracking his whereabouts. Chen Bocun is a Sichuanese man, also known as Lao Shi, 24 years old. His father runs a liquor store in Yuechi County, Sichuan, and his family is moderately well-off. Chen has been studying in Shanghai. He initially studied at Labor University. After the university closed, he returned home to help his father with work. In May 1930, he came to Shanghai again to study at the Cultural College in Jiangwan. Because of the summer vacation, Chen came to Shanghai to visit friends. The day before yesterday at 8 AM, Chen went to the Qiaoguang Middle School on McTaggart Road, Xiaoshadu Road, to</p>
<h3>Visit His Girlfriend Chen Zuoyun</h3>
<p>Unexpectedly, Chen Zuoyun had returned to her ancestral home in Nanyang a few days ago, so he left disappointed. By then, it was nearly noon, and he felt very hungry, so he ate at a small restaurant at the intersection of Xiaoshadu Road and Connaught Road. After finishing his meal, he wanted to defecate, so he turned into the Hude Road restroom. At this time, Chou Ya-hsiung and Zhu Baosheng were already in the restroom defecating. When Chen finished and reached into his pocket for toilet paper, he accidentally pulled out two ten-yuan banknotes that he had stored in his pocket. Chou and Zhu caught a glimpse of them and immediately asked Chen to lend them ten yuan. Chen refused. Chou and others suddenly said to him that if he did not lend them the money, they would report him to the authorities for murdering the Municipal Public Security Bureau</p>
<h3>Inspector Ma Shaowu.</h3>
<p>Upon hearing these words, Chen initially did not argue and simply straightened his clothes and left. However, Chou and Zhu followed him. On the way, Chou and others reported to Chinese police officers at No. 1240 and No. 1607, accusing Chen of being the murderer of Ma. The two police officers immediately arrested Chen and brought him along with Chou and Zhu to the Jing'an Temple police station. The case was reported to the police chief, who dispatched Detective Tang Zihong and Detective Cui Buyun to investigate the case. Yesterday morning at 8 AM, the police station escorted Chen to the First Special District Court. First, Zhang Shizhu, the police station's lawyer, described the above situation and said that Chou Ya-hsiung was originally a worker at the Shenxin Cotton Mill but had left his job the month before for some reason. When he was still working, Chen Bocun had</p>
<h3>Gone to Incite a Strike</h3>
<p>and other things. The police station has not yet fully investigated the situation, and the case is of great importance. Whether the reports of the two witnesses are true should also be investigated. It is requested that Chen be temporarily detained pending the conclusion of the investigation. If he is indeed the murderer, he should be prosecuted. The court then approved his detention for one week for further verification and ordered the two witnesses to withdraw and await trial.</p>
<h3>Li Fengxiang Tragically Commits Suicide After Communist Bandits Abduct His Wife and Murder His Son</h3>
<p>＝His Elderly Father Barely Escapes with His Life, a Single Letter Tears Him Apart＝</p>
<p>He Locks Himself in a Hotel Room, Ingests Opium, and Dies</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at about 1 AM, a man suddenly checked into the Hongyun Hotel at No. 1009 Haining Road. He claimed to be Li Fengxiang, a native of Jiangxi, 31 years old, and a bookkeeper at the Jiankang Association in this port. The hotel assigned him Room 112. Li paid one yuan for the room and went to sleep. Unexpectedly, at about 2 AM, the night watchman suddenly heard moaning from the room, suspecting that he had suddenly contracted an epidemic. He hurriedly tried to open the door and enter, and saw Li Fengxiang's face was pale. He was tossing and turning in bed, calling out in pain. When asked if he was sick, he shook his head and said nothing. After repeated questioning by the bookkeeper, he finally said that he had ingested poison. The hotel immediately reported to the Hongkou police station, who sent Li to Tongren Hospital for treatment. After the hospital examined him, they discovered that he had ingested a large amount of raw opium, which had already saturated his blood. He ultimately died despite efforts to save him. The hospital reported the death to the police station, who transferred the body to the autopsy institute. At the same time, the police found a letter from his father in Jiangxi on the deceased. The letter stated that the Communist bandits were rampant in his hometown of Jiangxi. Fengxiang's wife had been abducted by the Communist bandits, and his son had been brutally murdered. Only Li's elderly father had escaped, and he was now alone, penniless, and unable to escape the clutches of the bandits. The situation was tragic and heartbreaking. Therefore, it is speculated that Li's suicide was indirectly caused by the Communist bandits. How tragic!</p>

<h3>Gu Naijuan Sues Her Father to Confirm Her Paternity</h3>
<p>Her Biological Mother Has Divorced Her Father</p>
<p>Testified in Court Yesterday on Behalf of Her Daughter</p>
<p>Gu Pinjian, the owner of Zhengtai Cotton Yarn Shop at No. 740 Yongkang Lane, Beijing Road, is nearly fifty years old and originally from Jiading. On September 19, 1913, he married a woman surnamed Lu. On October 26 of the following year, they had a daughter named Naijuan. They lived together harmoniously for more than ten years. However, in 1924, Gu Pinjian and Gu Lu divorced due to differing opinions. At that time, Gu Naijuan was only twelve years old. It was stated that Gu Naijuan would be temporarily taken by her biological mother for care. Gu Pinjian then remarried. Because he had no children with his second wife, he adopted two sons, one now ten years old and the other only seven. Now that Gu Naijuan has reached the age of twenty, she has gradually gained knowledge. Because drifting outside for so long is not a good plan, she asked to return home to live last April. Unexpectedly, Gu Pinjian not only refused her request but also denied that she was his daughter. After Naijuan repeatedly pleaded, her stepmother suggested that Naijuan be fostered at the home of Gu Pinjian's friend, Wang Baosheng. But even in June of this year, they were still separated and unable to live at home. Helplessly, she hired lawyers Jiang Chipin and Qiu Fenling to petition the First Special District Court for mediation. Because Gu Pinjian did not attend, it was not established. She then filed a lawsuit asking the court to legally determine that Gu Pinjian was her biological father and allow her to return home, so that they could be reunited. The court approved the request and held a hearing on June 9. The defendant, Gu Pinjian, also hired lawyer Ye Fukan to defend him. Because witnesses needed to be added, the hearing was rescheduled for yesterday morning. Yesterday morning at 9:30 AM, Judge Luo opened the 14th Civil Court for questioning. First, Gu Naijuan testified, "I went to my uncle's place on September 20, 1931, and in April 1932, my uncle sent me back to my mother's house. I went to my father's place again on April 26 of last year, and then my father sent me to the home of his friend Wang Baosheng to be fostered." Next, the witness Pu Zhijun (Naijuan's uncle) testified, "In September 1913, Gu Pinjian married a woman surnamed Lu. In October 1914, they had Naijuan. I was invited to the full-month celebration. In September 1931, Naijuan came to my house and asked me to discuss with her father Gu Pinjian to let her return home. I discussed it with Gu, and Gu said that she would be temporarily fostered in my house. However, Gu said at the time that it would be for three months, and then Gu would take her back. But after the three months were up, I repeatedly urged him to take her back, but Gu repeatedly postponed it. I had no choice but to send Naijuan to her biological mother's place last April, intending for Naijuan to discuss it with her biological mother first before deciding on a solution." Finally, Gu Lu testified, "I married Gu Pinjian on September 19, 1913, and had Naijuan on October 26, 1914. In 1924, Gu Pinjian and I had disagreements and divorced. However, because Naijuan was still young at the time, she was temporarily cared for by me." Judge Luo postponed the hearing to the morning of the 19th of this month to add Pu Zhijun's brother to the case for questioning. Then, the court adjourned.</p>
<h3>Smuggled Artificial Silk of Ningbo Material Confiscated</h3>
<p>＝Bound for Hankou and Tianjin＝</p>
<p>Will Also Be Returned to Shanghai Within Days</p>
<p>The Wanguo Express Warehouse Company in this port declared twelve boxes of artificial silk on behalf of its customers, valued at more than 10,000 yuan. To evade taxes, the artificial silk was secretly stolen and replaced with straw and mud bricks. The scheme was discovered in Wenzhou. The original cargo has been returned to Shanghai. The Customs authority has ordered the Wanguo Express Warehouse Company, which originally made the declaration, to pursue the customer and send them to the Customs for handling. This matter was reported in this newspaper earlier. The counterfeit goods that were packed and shipped to various ports are being successively uncovered. Among them, those entrusted to the Ningshao Company's Xin Ningshao for shipment to Ningbo were handled in the same way. There were no consignee companies on the bill of lading. After receiving notifications from the Jianghai and Ouhai Customs, the Ningbo Customs opened the cargo and found that it was also straw and mud bricks, the same as those sent to Wenzhou. Those bound for Hankou and Tianjin and other ports will also be verified and returned to Shanghai in the next day or two. Currently, various shipping companies are pursuing Mr. Zhu of Wanguo Express Warehouse Company for the customs duties and round-trip shipping costs for the twelve boxes of artificial silk. It is reported that although the Express Company has determined that the goods were sold by Hengyuanxiang to merchants, the names of the buyers could not be found, so the tax evaders have not yet been found.</p>
<h3>Military Band Performances Still Held at Zhaofeng Park</h3>

(B) Matters for discussion: 1. Regarding the Gao case, it was decided to wait quietly for Mr. Du's mediation. Further discussions would be held after the results were available. The victim's father, Gao Yuanlin, was temporarily provided with funds by the committee to return home and manage family affairs. Mr. Du provided 100 yuan, which was temporarily stored with the owner of Hushun Yuan Tang store. However, a receipt must be issued and kept by the committee, pending further arrangements when the case is completely resolved. 2. Regarding the case of Zhu Ronghai being killed by an American soldier, the following resolutions were made: 1. The committee would hire lawyer Yu Xiuying to handle the case according to law. 2. The committee would publicly elect two committee members, Qian and Wei, to contact Mr. Zhang Shangyi for mediation. 3. The committee would send a letter to the American Consulate, forwarding it to the American military camp officer, requesting generous compensation for the victim's family, in order to maintain the friendly relations between China and the United States. 4. Measures to provide relief for the victim's family would be discussed when the case has a satisfactory resolution. However, the victim's father is currently in financial difficulty, and the committee will provide appropriate relief. 3. Regarding the publication of a newspaper, it was decided to continue.

<h3>Wusong Office of the Health Bureau to Lay Foundation Stone Today</h3>
<p>丨Mayor Wu Will Personally Preside Over Everything丨</p>
<p>The Wusong Office of the Health Bureau of this city has been under construction since last month. The preliminary work has now been completed in order. The Bureau originally scheduled the foundation stone laying ceremony for the 8th of this month, but it was postponed because Mayor Wu had not returned from Jiangxi. The Bureau has now rescheduled it for 2 PM today in Wusong. Mayor Wu will personally preside over the foundation laying. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Brief History of Construction</h3>
<p>Wusong's health facilities began in 1929. Because students from the Medical College of the National Central University joined in cooperation for on-site learning, everything progressed well. Unfortunately, the Shanghai Incident suddenly occurred, and it was destroyed by artillery fire. After the Shanghai War ended, although the Wusong District suffered from the ravages of war, residents continued to return, and the market gradually recovered. Li Yan'an, Director of the Health Bureau, recognized the importance of health protection in the district and, after repeated requests from citizens to restore these facilities for the sake of hygiene, specially petitioned the city government to find ways to restore them. Funds of 32,000 yuan were raised from the war zone's racetrack relief fund, and the Ministry of Health of the Interior approved a subsidy of more than 5,000 yuan. The National Tongji University also joined in cooperation for the convenience of its students' internships, and further helped to raise several thousand yuan in funding. In addition, the Jidetang, the former owner of the Wusong Seaside Hospital site, was negotiated to lease four acres and three points of public land to the Health Bureau for the construction of offices and hospitals at the lowest price. The Wusong Municipal Committee also strongly supported it. The Health Bureau then made proper plans, and the Boundary Affairs Bureau undertook it, beginning construction in early last month.</p>
<h3>Foundation Stone Laying Today</h3>
<p>After the Wusong Office of the Health Bureau</p>
<p>was built at the beginning of last month, the</p>
<p>preliminary project will be completed next time.</p>
<p>The contractor is Qiao Yuxing Construction Factory. The Bureau originally scheduled the foundation stone laying ceremony for the 8th of this month, but it was postponed because Mayor Wu had not returned from Jiangxi. Now that Mayor Wu has returned to Shanghai, the Bureau specifically scheduled the foundation stone laying for 2 PM today. Mayor Wu will personally preside over everything. Those who will participate at that time include important officials from the Municipal Government and various bureaus, members of the Municipal Committee of the District, and members of the medical community. All sectors are invited to attend the ceremony. The Bureau has issued 300 invitation cards yesterday.</p>
<h3>Organizational Situation</h3>
<p>After the foundation stone laying ceremony is held,</p>
<p>various projects will be actively carried out. It is</p>
<p>expected to be completed by the end of September</p>
<p>of this year. After various arrangements and equipment, the</p>
<p>office will officially open around New Year's Day next year. The internal organization</p>
<p>is divided into two departments: prevention and treatment. The plans are novel and all equipment</p>
<p>is improved, becoming a model for health equipment in various districts of the city. The method is that under the joint guidance of the Municipal Health Bureau and Tongji University, a health committee is established as a deliberative body, and a health office is established as an executive body. It is expected that the health undertakings in the district will have special progress.</p>
<h3>Temporary Facilities</h3>
<p>Until the new houses in the Wusong area are completed,</p>
<p>the health facilities before were</p>
<p>borrowed from Tongji University for several</p>
<p>rooms to serve as temporary offices, so that the citizens of the area can have hygiene guarantees. In view of the importance of hygiene this summer, the temporary office has been open since the 1st of this month.</p>

<h3>Bandit Leader Hidden in Cargo Hold Finally Caught by Detectives</h3>
<p>The detective team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, on May 20 of this year, arrested Zhang Xiaoping from Yong, Guan Heshang from Wuxi, Wang Yulin from Qingjiang, Chen Xiaobao, Wang Azhang from Changshu, and Shen Jigang from Qingjiang, six bandits involved in the robbery of the Yifeng cigarette paper store on Taiping Bridge in the French Concession and the Cai Chang vegetable market in Sanwanli, Zhabei, in April of this year, in room 7 of the Xinkang Inn, Xin'an Lane, Jisi Fei'er Road, and confiscated three handguns and twenty-three bullets. At the same time, they also captured the principal offender, Qian Genfa (nicknamed Wu Xiangong) from Changshu, and his accomplice Wang Ruisheng at 14 Yifeng Lane on the same road. They also apprehended Liu Xitang from Henan and Zhu Agou and Zhu Zhangshi, a couple from the local area, at 15 Zhuangjia Lane, Xiaoyang Bridge, Caojiadu, bringing the total number of people arrested to eleven. However, after questioning, they all confessed that the principal offender was Zhou Jiangjiang (nicknamed Xiao Lan Jiao A Da), who was still at large. After repeated investigations, it was discovered that Zhou was from Zhenhai, 32 years old, and a well-known bandit leader who had committed numerous crimes in the Chinese and French concessions. Since the case was solved, he fled to Hankou to avoid punishment. On the 9th of this month, he secretly returned to Shanghai from Hankou and borrowed four yuan from a friend at the Xin Zha Bridge, planning to return to Hankou on the original ship yesterday. However, because the plan was not secret, Captain Lu discovered it and ordered several detectives to go to the Ning Shao Wharf in Nanshi at 4:00 a.m. yesterday, together with the relevant district headquarters, to wait. Unexpectedly, the bandit was very alert and had already bribed the waiter to hide in the cargo hold at the stern, covered with miscellaneous items and sacks, and sealed off externally. After the detectives explained their intentions to the comprador, the hold was unsealed, and Zhou was captured on the spot, immediately taken back to the team for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Chauffeur Seduces Young Mistress and Flees with Her</h3>
<p>Gong Bojian, a 42-year-old man from Qingpu who works as a coolie foreman (commonly known as a "jian tou") in the Caojiadu area, resides at 1 Xingyi Lane, Fuchun Street, Fangbang Road, Nanshi. Gong's wife, Lin, gave birth to a son named Yinbo, 21 years old, who works as a foreign coppersmith. Gong is by nature thrifty and has accumulated some savings. Because he works daily from Nanshi to Caojiadu, a long distance, he prepared a car for transportation, hiring Yao Guanchang (38 years old) as a chauffeur. However, in March of the twelfth year of the Republic of China, Gong was persuaded by a friend to give a seven-year-old girl named A Ying from Ling Dongsheng to Gong as a child bride. When A Ying turned seventeen, Gong married her to his son Yinbo on December 11 two years ago. The young couple initially lived in harmony. Unexpectedly, on May 6 of this year, when Mr. and Mrs. Gong went to Hangzhou for sightseeing, A Ying was left at home to watch over the house. At that time, the chauffeur Yao Guanchang saw A Ying alone and harbored malicious intentions, seducing her in every way possible and eventually developing a relationship. They often secretly met in inns, and before Mr. and Mrs. Gong returned from Hangzhou, he incited A Ying to take cash, silver dollars, and jewelry, worth about five hundred yuan, and eloped to Zhuganwei, outside the West Gate of Songjiang, where they lived together as husband and wife. When Gong returned from his trip, the people were gone and the money was gone. He filed a report with the Public Security Bureau requesting an arrest. Until recently, it was discovered that the adulterer Yao Guanchang had come to Shanghai alone and was hiding at 30 Yaojiazhai, Hongqiao Road. Captain Lu ordered detectives to arrest Yao at that address, and at the same time, sent personnel to Songjiang to arrest A Ying. They were sent to Shanghai yesterday to be interrogated.</p>

He was on his way to the home of a relative on Tao Peng Road, but he was unfamiliar with the route. As he was wandering around on Weituoma Road in Yangshupu, Ji Xigen from Tongzhou noticed that his abdomen was bulging and knew that he was carrying something. He went up and asked where he wanted to go. Gan said that he did not know the way. Ji then offered to guide him. However, after walking a few steps, Ji suddenly asked, "What exactly are you carrying? Take it out immediately!" He also pointed to a Mr. Jia standing nearby, saying that he was a plainclothes patrolman from the police station. However, Gan Chenghua firmly refused. Ji slapped Gan in the face, leading to a dispute. Two Chinese constables from the nearby No. 46 and other stations heard the commotion and rushed over, taking Gan and Ji to the police station. Forty taels of opium were found on Gan. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Local Court. Judge Wu Zehan presided over the trial. Police station lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated the case. Then, two Chinese constables reported the situation of the investigation and presented the opium for inspection. Gan Chenghua confessed that he came to Shanghai from Chongqing and that the opium was owed to him by a friend surnamed Chen for sixty yuan. He could not get the money back, so he brought the opium to sell for ten yuan. On the way, he met Ji Xigen, who wanted to rob him of the opium under the pretext of guiding him. Ji Xigen's confession was evasive. After reviewing the confessions, Judge Wu sentenced Gan Chenghua to six months' imprisonment and Ji Xigen to twenty days' detention. The opium was confiscated.</p>
<h3>Bandits Captured, Firearms Seized</h3>
<p>Jiang Juwu, Lu Gendi, Ding Huaguo and other Chinese detectives of the New Gate Police Station, having learned that bandits were planning to commit illegal acts in the Niuzhuang Road area, reported to the police chief, and together with detectives Yang Peizhang and Ji Binkui, arrested Zhang A Da and Xu Huanzhang, two bandits, on Niuzhuang Road the previous day.

Afterwards, they successively arrested Wang Yin, Wang Yao Shi, Chen Chongxian, Chen Xu Shi and other four accomplices at No. 136 Xin Zha Bridge Road and No. 49 Anxiang Lane, Datong Road, Zhabei. Except for the seized firearms, which were temporarily kept at the Public Security Bureau, the other six people were all taken back to the police station and detained separately. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court.

<h3>Woman's Legs Injured by Car, Husband Sues for Compensation</h3>
<p>Wang Gengsheng, a local chauffeur, was driving a No. 16,501 cargo truck on Labor Sheng Road in West Shanghai on the 24th of last month when Sun Lin Shi, a Ningbo woman, was carrying a bamboo basket to the vegetable market to buy vegetables. As she was walking in the area, she was knocked down and her legs were injured by the front wheel of the truck. Chinese Constable No. 2,414 saw this and sent the injured woman to Guangci Hospital for treatment. At the same time, he reported the witnessed situation of Wang Gengsheng's careless accident causing injury to the Putuo Road Police Station for investigation. Sun Lin Shi has been hospitalized for treatment for over ten days, and her legs have not yet healed. According to the doctor's diagnosis, it is difficult to save the toes of both feet, so they have been amputated. Sun's husband said that because she is not yet forty years old, even if she recovers, she will be disabled. Wang Gengsheng is truly responsible for negligence of duty, so he hired lawyer Lin Jiching on behalf of his wife to file a criminal lawsuit against the driver with the First Special District Local Court, requesting that he be punished according to the law and that he compensate for all losses. However, Wang Gengsheng believes that the accident was caused by Sun Lin Shi's own carelessness, and he should not be solely responsible. Therefore, he also hired lawyers Ye Shaoying and Yang Linzhi to defend him. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu Xiangzu opened the court for trial. Sun Lin Shi was unable to appear in court, so lawyer Lin stated the plaintiff's intentions and the circumstances of the accident on her behalf, and submitted a map of the accident site to the court. Afterwards, Chinese Constable No. 2414 came to court to testify, saying that although the defendant was not driving fast at the time, he did not hear him sound the horn, etc. Wang Gengsheng confessed that he had already sounded the horn at the time, but because the woman had already crossed in front of the car and suddenly retreated, his car could not avoid it. Judge Wu said that it was necessary to interrogate the victim in order to clarify the facts of the case, and that it was necessary to have the victim come to court in person to have the injuries examined by a forensic doctor. Therefore, the court decided to reschedule the trial for the afternoon of July 27.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor: Regarding the article published in your newspaper on July 13th, "Zhabei Silk Factory Strikes Again Yesterday," which stated that when the factory was about to pay the weekly wages, the workers claimed that according to the regulations, each person should receive 5 jiao 8 fen, but the factory only paid 5 jiao per worker. Therefore, they questioned the factory, but the factory replied that 8 fen of it was deducted at the request of the labor union to be handed over to the labor union, etc. This is inconsistent with the facts. The increase in wages to 5 jiao was decided by the Social Affairs Bureau through mediation. The workers may have misunderstood. How could our factory not guide them? Moreover, our factory did not pay any weekly bonuses or wages that day, and the workers did not ask about this. Their strike was due to believing rumors and misunderstandings. The Social Affairs Bureau and the 6th District Silk Industry Labor Union have sent people to explain in detail, and work has resumed as usual. Therefore, we specifically send this letter for correction and hope it will be published in the "Letters to the Editor" column. Yours respectfully, Ji Yu Tai Ji Silk Factory, July 14th.</p>

This certificate, with the signature and seal of the guarantor.</p>
<h3>Suzhou High School Students Win the Top Three Places in the Jiangsu Provincial High School Graduation Examination</h3>
<p>Occupying 25 of the Top 100 Students in the Highest Grade (Suzhou, 14th) The results of the Jiangsu Provincial High School Examination have been announced. The first, second, and third places were all won by Suzhou High School students, and Suzhou High School students accounted for 25 of the top 100 students in the highest grade.</p>
<h3>Re-examination of Graduation Year for Colleges Above Colleges in Pingjin</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 14th) The Ministry of Education ordered the schools above the Pingjin colleges, saying that the school year examination and the graduation examination are to examine the academic performance of students, and the regulations are very strict. Previously, the Pingjin schools, due to the impact of the war, mostly ended and closed for vacation at the end of this academic term. The statutory examinations were mostly not handled in accordance with the regulations. Now that the order has been restored, the schools must strictly re-examine the above two examinations in accordance with the prescribed procedures when or before the next semester begins. If there are any perfunctory or accommodating circumstances, the Ministry will not recognize the results as valid.</p>

<p>Decided to Allocate This Year's Business Expenses of 402,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The ninth annual meeting of the China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture was held at the Capital Hotel on the 14th of this month. Attendees included directors Cai Yuanpei, Zhou Yichun, Gu Lin, Ren Hongjun, Baker, Xu Xinliu, and Situ Leideng. Director Shen of the Ministry of Education, Director Liu of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Mr. Gasslin of the U.S. Embassy were also present as observers. The meeting began at 9:00 AM, with reports on the various affairs of the association over the past year by the Honorary Secretary, Honorary Accountant, Executive Committee, and Secretary-General in turn. Following this, the budget for the association's self-managed and jointly-managed ventures for the next year and the subsidy applications from various requesting organizations were discussed. Each item was carefully considered and decisions were made. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>National Currency 65,000 Yuan</p>
<p>1.  Scientific Professorship: USD 10,600</p>
<p>2.  Scientific Research Professorship: National Currency 33,200 Yuan</p>

<p>The directors whose terms expired this year were Cai Yuanpei, Yuan Nuode, and Jin Shaoji. All three were re-elected. The officers of the Board of Directors and members of the various standing committees for the next year were also separately nominated. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM. It is reported that the directors from out of town left Shanghai yesterday evening by different routes. The association's funding comes from the U.S. returned Boxer Indemnity. Since the government suspended payment of the U.S. returned Boxer Indemnity for one year last year, and is now two months in arrears this year, the association's finances are under considerable strain. In terms of finances, the new subsidies granted this year are already a stretch for the association to maintain. If silver prices continue to rise, the association's income will inevitably decrease further, and next year, it is feared that it will feel even more financially exhausted.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is reported that the annual meeting of the China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture has concluded. However, the association will convene a financial subcommittee meeting today to discuss investment ventures. Directors of the association with financial connections will attend the meeting.</p>
<h3>The City Education Bureau Decides on College Entrance Preliminary Examination Methods</h3>
<p>The preliminary college entrance examination for graduates of unregistered private high schools in this city, organized by the City Education Bureau, will be held at Wu Ben Girls' High School starting at 8:00 AM on the 18th of this month. A great number of people have registered, close to 400. Yesterday (the 13th), the Director of the Bureau convened the college entrance preliminary examination committee, chaired by Director Pan, to discuss the following key points:</p>
<p>(1) The examination subjects and times are stipulated as follows: (1) Chinese Language, 8:00 AM to 9:50 AM; (2) Mathematics, 10:00 AM to 11:50 AM; (3) English or French, 1:00 PM to 2:50 PM; (4) Elective Subject, 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM; (5) Vocational Subject, 8:00 AM to 10:00 AM on the 19th.</p>
<p>(2) Examination questions for each subject: (1) Chinese Language: one composition, general knowledge of Chinese studies, ten Q&amp;A questions; (2) Mathematics: algebra, choose two out of four questions; geometry, algebra, and trigonometry, choose one out of three questions; (3) English: one composition, correct errors, fill in the blanks, translation; (4) French: same as English; (5) History and Geography: ten Q&amp;A questions; (6) Physics and Chemistry: choose eight out of ten Q&amp;A questions; (7) Psychology and Education: same as Physics and Chemistry; (8) Agricultural Science: five groups, choose five out of ten questions; (9) Engineering: nine questions, choose six; (10) Civil Engineering: same as Engineering; (11) Commerce: choose four out of five questions; (12) Railway Management: choose four out of five questions. All questions must be submitted to the Chairman of the Committee before 10:00 AM on the 17th.</p>
<p>(3) Examination papers for marking and invigilation will be sealed uniformly and reviewed by the committee.</p>
<p>The process must be completed no later than the morning of the 24th. Invigilation will be handled by the committee members and Education Bureau staff.</p>
<p>(4) Prohibition of Examinations: The Bureau has discovered that students from certain registered private schools in Nanjing, who have not participated in the city's joint examination, have come to Shanghai to take the preliminary college entrance examination. This is a violation of the rules and will not be allowed.</p>
<h3>President Jiang of Peking University Leaves Beijing for Shanghai</h3>
<p>President Jiang Menglin of Peking University recently came to Beijing from Peiping. It is said that this trip south is to report to the government on the recent situation of Peking University and to add one or two professors. The head of the Education Department of the university has remotely invited Yang Lianggong to take the position. However, Yang has already taken office as a member of the Control Yuan and has repeatedly declined the invitation and cannot be retained. Therefore, the position is still vacant and a replacement must be found. Jiang's mission to Beijing has been completed and he will go to Shanghai by night train on the 14th, stay for a few days, and then return to Peiping.</p>
<h3>Statement by Ge Zulan, Former Principal of Chengzhong Middle School, Regarding the Board of Directors' Statement</h3>
<p>A letter from Ge Zulan, former principal of Chengzhong Middle School, states: "To the editor, your newspaper published another statement from the Chengzhong Middle School Board of Directors on July 14th.</p>
<p>The statement concludes with: 'We hope that members of society will consider the difficulties faced by the school's founder and provide support. We and others will uphold our original intention of protecting the school and work even harder. We are unwilling to respond to any other meaningless disputes in writing.' After carefully reading this, Zulan believes that if the current board members of Chengzhong Middle School truly have this intention, then Zulan, in his position as an alumnus, former dean of studies, and former principal, would never again make any further announcements. However, I sincerely hope that members of society will not misunderstand Zulan as feeling guilty before the gods because of the board's statement and thus refraining from speaking. Zulan has written documents from the board that can prove that the resignation date was not mistaken (the letter issued on June 26th cannot be considered a resignation letter; even if it is considered a resignation letter, the approval was still on August 4th). Furthermore, Mrs. Ye Yunqing, the wife of the school's founder, Mr. He Fenglai, the teacher in the Ye family, and Mr. Xiang Weicun, the former dean of studies, can all prove that the previous defense was not fabricated. Mrs. Ye knows the details of whether there was a 'matter of people.' Although there were many attempts to retain me, Mr. Shi Jinsheng knows whether the intentions were sincere. As for repeatedly taking over from the Education Bureau, Mr. Xu Peihuang, the former director of the Education Bureau and current director of the Public Works Bureau, can explain the details. The 'generous gift' upon departure, which the statement refers to as a generous gesture, did indeed happen. A humble person should be grateful for this, but I also believe that this is not money to silence me. Saying what is right and correcting what is wrong is the nature of a scholar. In short, Zulan's love for the school is no less than that of the current board members. The current dean of studies, Mr. Wu Cuilun, was hired as a mathematics teacher when Zulan was the principal. He has served as the principal of Kunshan Middle School and the director of general affairs of the Chinese Vocational Education Society, with perfect knowledge and experience. Before he took office, he consulted Zulan on whether to accept the position. Zulan, in his capacity as an alumnus, strongly encouraged him to take the position. The school's academic affairs now rely on Mr. Wu's leadership, which shows that Zulan has been secretly helping the alma mater in ways unknown to the board. Also, when the current principal, Mr. Chen Bin, took office, Zulan suggested to Mr. Chen to restore the high school division, as Zulan knew that the school had the financial resources to run a high school. In addition, on weekdays, if Dean Wu had any questions, Zulan would offer his humble opinions to Mr. Wu. Ask him in person to clarify the truth. Furthermore, when Zulan resigned on July 10th, the three directors, Wang Fengnian, Cao Lansheng, and Cen Zihou, came to persuade me to stay, and Zulan strongly recommended Mr. Mao Ru, an expert in secondary education, as the next principal. The board should still remember this. Zulan only wants to express this much, and will not say any more. I only hope that from now on, you will uphold your original intention of protecting the school and work even harder, and not act impulsively, seeking momentary pleasure, and destroy the school yourself. It would be fortunate. Sincerely, Ge Zulan, July 14th.</p>

<h3>AC Hum in AC Radios</h3>
<p>— Xiang</p>
<p>The biggest drawback of AC radios is that they are prone to humming (Hum). Although this humming cannot be completely eliminated, if designed properly, it can be reduced to a minimum so as not to interfere with reception.</p>
<p>Source 1. Due to insufficient capacitance or leakage of the filter capacitor in the power supply section, or the filter choke being too small.</p>
<p>2. Due to the loudspeaker. Because the magnetic field coil (Field Coil) of ordinary AC dynamic loudspeakers (DymaicSpeaker, commonly known as electric horn) also uses a filter choke, the pulsating DC current after rectification can often be induced into the voice coil (VoiceCoil), resulting in strong AC hum.</p>
<p>3. Due to other random electrostatic and magnetic field induction.</p>
<p>4. Sometimes, the live wire of the electric light introduces the signal voltage to the rectifier tube, which modulates with the output voltage, transmitting to various circuits of the radio, resulting in AC hum.</p>
<p>5. Sometimes, the alternating current field around the pole or cathode has the ability to control the screen current, so it can also generate a small amount of AC hum.</p>
<p>6. In indirectly heated vacuum tubes, the voltage between the cathode (Cathode) and the heater (Heater) is too high, causing leakage in the middle.</p>
<h3>Inspection Method</h3>
<p>To eliminate AC hum, the source must first be identified. The inspection steps are to short-circuit the input and output circuits of each stage in order to distinguish which stage the AC hum is generated in. If the AC hum cannot be eliminated when the input circuit of the last low-frequency amplification stage is short-circuited, then the obstacle is probably in the power supply section. If the AC hum continues to exist after the output transformer or the voice coil of the loudspeaker is short-circuited, it can be determined that it is due to the second type of source. As for the elimination method, I will discuss it in the next issue.</p>
<h3>Talking About Loudspeakers (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Yizhi</p>
<p>(3) Balanced Diaphragm Loudspeaker: This loudspeaker is a combination of bipolar and balanced armature types. It can also be said to be made of two bipolar types. Its simple structural principle is shown in Figure 4. MM is the magnet, C is the voice coil, and D is the diaphragm. Its sound amplification principle is the same as that of the balanced type. Its characteristics are (1) the balanced diaphragm always maintains its balanced position, so the reciprocating amplitude is always equal; (2) because a small magnet passes through part of the magnetic flux, the magnetism is not easily lost; (3) the magnetic field is not easily saturated, and the load current can be increased; (4) it does not generate double-frequency noise. Its use: similar to that of the balanced armature type, but this type is slightly more difficult to manufacture than the balanced armature type and the price is also slightly more expensive, so it is not as widely used as the balanced armature type.</p>
<p>(2) Moving Coil Loudspeaker:</p>
<p>The structural principle of the moving coil loudspeaker is slightly different from that of the fixed coil type. Its structure is based on the principle of a motor. When the moving coil is loaded with a sound wave current, a magnetic field is generated between the coils, which changes the attraction force with the parent magnetic field (this magnetic field is generated by introducing current to the excitation coil to create a strong electromagnetic field), pushing and pulling back and forth, vibrating and exciting the diaphragm to become a sound wave. A special feature of this loudspeaker is that the magnetic field does not use permanent magnets. However, because this type of loudspeaker needs to push a large diaphragm of the moving coil, a strong magnetic field is required. The magnetic field strength of a permanent magnet, for the same size, is always lower than that of an electromagnet. Its structure is shown in Figure 5: E is the magnet, C is the excitation coil, M is the moving coil, and D is the hollow conical diaphragm. When an external sound wave current is input into the moving coil, it changes the attraction force with the parent magnetic field, pushing the diaphragm and emitting sound. The advantages of this type of loudspeaker are (1) the diaphragm is not limited by the air gap, so the diaphragm amplitude can be expanded; (2) unlike the fixed coil type, it does not need a certain elasticity to maintain its working stability; (3) the current of the moving coil is completely proportional to the current that pushes this coil; (4) because the magnetic lines do not pass through the diaphragm, saturation does not occur. These are some of its advantages, but there are also several disadvantages: (1) the parent magnetic field needs a strong magnetic force, so the required magnet area is larger and the weight is increased; (2) it needs direct current to excite the magnetic force, so it consumes more power; (3) the structure is quite difficult and the price is more expensive than the fixed type. This type of loudspeaker is most suitable for use in powerful radios or amplifiers to be heard by dozens or hundreds or thousands of people. The AC radios and amplifiers in movie theaters on the market are all of this type. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Transformer Revival Method</h3>
<p>— Zhi</p>
<p>Transformers are most easily damaged (the reasons are no more than two: one is that the load current is too large and the wire is broken, and the other is that moisture intrusion breaks the wire). After damage, replacing the new coil is almost the same price as buying a new one; if you disassemble and rewind, the procedures are cumbersome and only those with experience can do it. Therefore, when the transformer is damaged, it is often discarded and a new one is purchased. But now there is a simple repair method that can instantly restore the damaged transformer, just like performing a revival method on a vacuum tube. The method is as follows:</p>
<p>Connect the two poles (mostly the P pole and B pole) of the damaged transformer (specifically referring to audio transformers Audio transformer) with broken wires directly to a 220-volt voltage for about two or three seconds, which can naturally connect and revive the broken wires. If it doesn't work, continue the experiment like this once; if it doesn't work again, continue once more and extend the time slightly. If the transformer still cannot be revived after three such experiments, then the distance of the break in the transformer is too large to revive it, and it can only be disassembled and rewound.</p>
<p>Why can the broken wire of the transformer be naturally welded after connecting to a 220-volt voltage? This is the application of the principle of arc welding (ElectricaicWeldiidg). If you want to study it in depth, please refer to the electric welding method in any electrical engineering book.</p>
<p>The author once had two transformers, one with the positive loop burned out and one with mold breaking the wire. Both have been revived using this method. It has been used for more than four months now and has not been damaged. Those who have damaged transformers may wish to experiment.</p>
<h3>Small Experience</h3>
<p>— Ke Rongyan</p>
<p>(1) It is difficult to scrape off the paint on thin enameled steel wire. You can use a wire to burn the paint off on an alcohol lamp.</p>
<p>(2) The tin sheet of toothpaste tube is a good material for making fixed capacitors; the tin lid is also an excellent mineral cup.</p>
<p>(3) Hard cardboard soaked in candle oil and painted with paint is a good insulating board; broken phonograph records can also be used in the same way.</p>
<p>(4) Both ends of the rubber tube coil can be connected to two terminals, which can be convenient for loading and unloading.</p>
<p>(5) Two spider web coil boards are connected with a screw, and a spring from an old thermos bottle is sandwiched in the middle, which is a set of three-circuit coil racks. You can immediately wind the primary and secondary coils on the first board and the regenerative coil on the second board. Rotating the nut on the screw can finely adjust the regenerative force.</p>
<p>(6) Broken celluloid cigarette cases, soap boxes, etc. can be cut into small pieces and wound with resistance wires, etc. as insulators.</p>
<h3>Self-Made Slow Rotation Dial</h3>
<p>— Li Yuanqing</p>
<p>A radio with good selectivity, if there is a slight difference in adjustment, it cannot get sound. If you want to get accurate and convenient adjustment, you can't do without a slow rotation dial.</p>
<p>The slow rotation dial introduced in this article is very simple in structure, but it is also very convenient to use. First, tighten the bakelite top of the wiring stud tightly to prevent it from slipping out easily. Then put a small section of rubber tube on the bakelite top. Then drill a small hole in the plastic board, insert the wiring stud, put on the spring, and tighten it with two screw nuts. (As shown in the figure) Because the rubber tube has elasticity, it can be lubricated freely when rotating.</p>
<h3>Timer Switch Made Using an Alarm Clock</h3>
<p>— Li Qing</p>
<p>Many friends who play with the radio, because they are too fascinated, even if they are in bed, they are still reluctant to drop the earphones. But if you are not careful, you will fall asleep, and as a result, not only is the battery wasted, but the radio is also easily damaged because it is open for a long time. To avoid this loss, you have to install a timer switch.</p>
<p>Connect to A Battery or AC220V Radio</p>
<p>As shown in the figure, C is the alarm clock, W is the wooden strip, AB is the copper sheet, and D is the wooden piece. (Fixed in the small hole of the K key with screws) First set the alarm clock pointer to the time you want to stop, then when the K key reaches the predetermined time, it will rotate towards W, and at the same time, the two copper sheets AB can automatically disconnect the circuit because they have elasticity.</p>
<p>Note: If this device is used in an AC radio, all parts of the two copper sheets AB must be completely wrapped with cloth except for the contact points, otherwise it is easy to cause danger.</p>
<h3>Internal and External News</h3>
<p>Qingdao Radio Broadcasting Station Established: Because the North China Games were held in Qingdao this year, the Qingdao Municipal Government entrusted the Qingdao Naval Radio Factory to manufacture a 150-watt radio broadcasting machine to report on the situation at the venue in May. The wavelength is 340 meters, and it is installed in the Mass Education Center. The machine was completed at the end of June. Now the factory's engineering director Fu Kongyi and engineer Zheng Henan are experimenting day and night and have made many improvements. According to reports from listeners from all over the world, the sound is clear. — Fang Mei</p>
<p>The China Radio Research Society Has Newly Opened a Repair Department at 314 Dalu Commercial Market: The China Radio Research Society, organized by Mr. Tao Jun and other predecessors in the radio industry, specializes in manufacturing various radio broadcasting, transmitting, and receiving machines, and has long been famous throughout the country. Now, in view of the need for repairing radios, it has opened a repair department to specialize in repairing various radios, all doubts</p>
<h3>Common Knowledge</h3>
<p>— Huang Jiancun</p>
<p>(10) Receiving Antenna and Ground Wire (1) The term "antenna," in English called "Antenna," originally should be interpreted as the antennae of an insect. Because an antenna uses a conductor suspended high in space to absorb radio waves, its function is quite similar to the antennae of an insect (commonly called "whiskers"), so people at the time used the name "Antenna" for antennae as the name for antennas.</p>
<p>A ground wire is a metal object buried in the ground to complete the antenna's circuit, allowing the received current to oscillate in the circuit and become the driving force of the radio.</p>
<p>Therefore, the quality of the antenna and ground wire has a great impact on the efficiency of radio reception. In particular, crystal radios, unlike vacuum tube radios, do not have amplification and can only use the current generated in the antenna directly as the driving force.</p>
<p>Therefore, the quality of the antenna and ground wire must be carefully considered.</p>
<p>(1) Antenna Shape: Although there are many shapes of antennas, there are several common types used for receiving broadcasts: (A) Inverted L-type antenna: As shown in the first diagram, this type of antenna suspends a horizontal wire between two bamboo poles, each end connected to a porcelain or glass insulator, and connects one end to a lead-in wire, leading to the radio indoors. Its shape is quite similar to an inverted letter "L," hence the name inverted L-type antenna. Figure 4</p>
<p>(B) T-type antenna: As shown in the second diagram, this type of antenna has the lead-in wire connected to the center of the horizontal wire, and its shape is quite similar to the letter "T."</p>
<p>(C) Inclined antenna: As shown in the third diagram, a conductor is mounted diagonally on a wooden pole.</p>
<p>Figure 3 Radio</p>
<p>(D) Loop antenna: As shown in the fourth diagram, this type of antenna is made by winding about a hundred feet of insulated conductor wire into a square. It has excellent directivity and is often used in high-end radios with excellent sensitivity.</p>
<p>In diagrams, the symbol for an antenna, regardless of its shape, is often</p>
<p>Figure 2 Radio</p>
<p>or , but for a loop antenna, the symbol is Figure 1 Radio</p>
<p>(2) Antenna Height: The higher the antenna is erected, the greater the voltage it receives, and the sensitivity of the radio (Sensitivity) also increases greatly. However, the higher the antenna, the more difficult it is to handle. Generally, for receiving broadcasts, a height of about seven to ten meters is used, and the length of the horizontal part is about the same as the height or twice that number is more suitable.</p>
<p>(3) Antenna Position: If there are electric lights, power lines, or telegraph and telephone lines near the antenna, the antenna will be affected, and the sensitivity of the radio will be reduced. Therefore, the antenna must be at least three meters away from power lines, etc., and at least six meters away from high-voltage lines.</p>
<p>Difficult problems can be solved. In addition, if there is any damage within one year, it can be repaired free of charge. The service can be called thoughtful, making it the best in the market.</p>
<p>Keller vacuum tubes have arrived in Shanghai at Kangmao Radio Company, No. 47 Ningbo Road, which has always been known for managing Uais radios. In view of the fact that there are not many good radio vacuum tubes in Shanghai, a variety of Keller brand radio vacuum tubes have been specially ordered from the United States and have now arrived in Shanghai. The price is exceptionally restrained, the manufacturing is extremely sophisticated, and users are deeply satisfied. A large batch of Pielsdeng wires has also arrived, and all wires for aviation electrical appliances and radios are available, making them ideal for making circuits and antennas. To facilitate customers, the company has set up an inquiry department, and all inquiries will be answered immediately.</p>
<p>The Wheeler Company Repair Department's Equipment No. 24 Nanjing Road, The Wheeler Company Repair Department specializes in repairing various wireless radios and refrigerators. The department is well-equipped and large-scale, with testers and electric meters to test the damaged parts of each machine with extreme accuracy. It employs Chinese and Western electrical engineering specialists to handle the work. In addition, a large batch of spare parts is available for purchase and replacement. Therefore, the repair work is perfect, unique in Shanghai, and the rapid repair, with pick-up on the same day, is especially rare.</p>

<h3>Filial Son Keeping Watch Over the Tomb</h3>
<p>— Shanlu</p>
<p>Nouns are related to the times; good nouns in ancient times can become dirty nouns in modern times. Ancient sex books must be read solemnly; modern sex books have become a medium for inciting lewdness. Ancient sages were revered and supreme titles; modern sages have become terms of ridicule. Recently, many filial sons keeping watch over tombs have emerged in Henan. Looking at it with old eyes, the system of guarding the tomb for about three years has been revived, which can expand the Twenty-four Filial Piety into Twenty-five Filial Piety. If Zuo Qiuming were reborn in this world, he would definitely sing his praises, saying: "The Book of Songs says, 'Filial sons are never exhausted, and their kind will be blessed forever.' Is this what it means?"</p>
<p>However, after investigating the truth about the filial sons guarding the tomb, alas! Their ancestors of the seventeenth generation are truly unfortunate to have these filial sons guarding the tomb! It turns out that Anyang, Henan, known as the ancient Yin Ruins, has been the site of continuous excavation work since the Academia Sinica once excavated it. As soon as colorful ancient artifacts appear, many antique ghosts, like flies attached to dung, follow them. Commonly known as "digging up ancestors' graves," it means digging up other people's ancestral graves. Now, people in Anyang are digging up their own ancestral graves. If no one is watching during the excavation, they will inevitably be swallowed up by the servants. Therefore, descendants digging up ancestral graves are regarded as a rare commodity to be hoarded, and the landowner must supervise the excavation. The servants call these supervising landowners "filial sons guarding the tomb." As a result, many filial sons guarding the tomb, who brave the frost and snow and do not fear the wind and rain, have suddenly been added to the tombs in Anyang. How filial are the people of Anyang! How filial are the people of Anyang! With these filial sons guarding the tomb, the good word "filial piety" has been corrupted by later generations. The "anti-filial piety faction" once said, "Of all evils, filial piety is the head." These five words are indeed an overstatement, but they are perfectly suited to the filial sons guarding the tomb in Anyang and do not feel excessive at all.</p>
<h3>The Japanese's Search</h3>
<p>— Sisu</p>
<p>The Japanese have been collecting Chinese antiques for a long time. Many Chinese cultural relics have been transported overseas to the east and stored in Japanese official and private collections. It is unknown how many there are. By now, it seems that the valuable antiques have been collected almost completely, and there is gradually nothing left to collect. Therefore, they have had to expand the scope of their search, not limited to the ancient, but also including the modern, not limited to rare treasures, but also including trivial things. Anything that China does not have much of is included in the search. The antiques passed down from ancient times are ultimately limited. When the Japanese collect one item, China loses one item. Antiques cannot give birth to antiques. Imitations are copies, not antiques. The Japanese have exhausted all means, either secretly buying them, or forcibly buying them by relying on their power, such as buying the Qin and Han bricks and tiles and stone Buddhas from a certain family a few years ago; or they have resorted to military occupation, such as all the antiques in the four northeastern provinces, which have become prisoners. Shenyang has the Forbidden City, and Rehe has the Imperial Villa. The antiques here are especially abundant, and the Japanese have collected them most happily and satisfactorily. However, the more the Japanese collect, the more China lacks, like a lamp that has run out of oil. Where else can they collect? We know that there are several Chinese rare books in Japanese libraries. Chinese people cannot see books written by Chinese people, but they flow into Japanese libraries instead. The Japanese are so proud of this, and the Chinese are so frustrated! However, the so-called rare books are ultimately only a few. If the Chinese also have them stored, they are not rare books and are not precious enough. If they are still limited to antiques, they will be laboring in vain. The clever Japanese have expanded the scope of their search.</p>
<p>The expansion began on September 18 of the year before last. Just look: since 9/18, the rare Chinese items collected in Changchun are so abundant. How many Zheng Xiaoxus can be found in such a large China? Regarding rarity as precious, after the Japanese began to expand the scope, they regarded "rarity" as the condition for all searches. Anything rare in China is regarded as precious as an antique, regardless of whether the Chinese consider it smelly or rotten, they all regard it as magical and happily collect it endlessly. Therefore, even gangsters are treasured this year. Who knows what else will be taken away in the future!</p>
<h3>Random Talk About Cartoons</h3>
<p>— (Qian Yun writes, Dong Liang draws)</p>
<p>Big Shanghai?</p>
<p>Why are the streets of Shanghai so crowded lately? They were driven out by bedbugs! Most of them. Often more than ten families live in one house. To put it bluntly, people live inside like steamed buns in a steamer, cooked by the fire. Cold days are okay, but hot days are</p>
<p>It's killing people; so they eat in the open air, sleep in the open air, and even excrete in the open air. The open air is the world of people in the steamer, and the world is their sky. They sleep on the ground and are covered by the sky. It's great!</p>
<p>Shanghai is really an amazing place (so those who write in English say that this kind of pronunciation is loud, and I will borrow it here to show its amazingness), otherwise why do people from all over the world come in droves, sometimes even squeezing some people into the Huangpu River? In fact, not only are the houses crowded, but even food is not available; unfortunately, most people still don't believe this, thinking that Shanghai is such a big place.</p>
<h3>The Life of a Goddess</h3>
<p>— Bing Ding</p>
<p>An ancient poet said: "Don't say that human beings are like mandarin ducks, I will look at them as wailing geese." This is what the ancients wrote when lamenting prostitutes. I often daydream, thinking that a good woman, why would she willingly become a prostitute? Is it for poverty? There are many occupations for women, so why bother with this kind of physical life? Is it for comfort? Working under the stars and moon, serving people with trepidation, is not necessarily a spiritually peaceful life. However, they enjoy it tirelessly, and are willing to live this kind of "inhuman life," which is really puzzling.</p>
<p>It's not that I'm negating the current prostitutes, thinking that there are also those with good character, and their beauty may not be inferior to that of the ancients. However, the prostitutes of the past often had skills besides their appearance, such as poetry, painting, and music, all of which were well-established. What about now? Singing a few Peking operas, dancing, flirting, riding in cars, and eating big dishes are all they know. Once they open their mouths, most of them are like hooligans, tricksters, or maybe superficial Europeans. Embroidered pillows, I really dare not compliment them.</p>
<p>During the Song Dynasty, Liang Hongyu was able to recognize Han Shizhong and help her husband defeat the Jin people. When Su Dongpo was in Hangzhou, the prostitute Zhou Shao wrote a poem and asked to be removed from the register: "The nest on the beam is empty, and the years are alarming. Looking back, I comb my wings. If you release the white-clothed woman from the cage, I will always recite the Avalokiteśvara Prajñā Sutra."</p>
<p>Li Shishi was able to overthrow the Daoist monarch, not necessarily because of her appearance, but probably because her skills were superior. Although the officials of the Ming Dynasty indulged in pleasure, it was indeed a sign of national subjugation; however, these Chen Yuanyuan, Liu Rushi, Dong Xiaowan, and Li Xiangjun must also have had many special talents to be able to become demons of national subjugation. Today's prostitutes are probably not up to that level. For example, the famous Sai Jinhua, does she know poetry? Does she know painting? She's just romantic. Since Kuai, it's really hard to find a singer from the Ming Dynasty. For example, if someone wants to write a modern "Biography of Famous Prostitutes," it will be as difficult as writing a modern "Biography of Honest Officials." Going to brothels is an elegant thing, not a vulgar thing. Because sexual comfort is enough to regulate a lonely life, it cannot be said that a person who goes to brothels without being chaotic is a bad thing. However, judging from the current situation, unless one is ignorant, who dares to say that "the world is turbid?" Where can we talk about "elegance"? As for other places where flesh is bought and sold, it is really an expression of bestiality. I call them "wailing geese" because of my compassion!</p>
<h3>Four Northeast Company Commanders</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 11: Bowing Their Heads in Agreement to Marriage, Fragrant Feelings Flowing; Caring for the Soldiers, Joyful Air Everywhere. Li Changfa was stunned for a while, his hanging hands twitching a few times, and slowly said, "He is my grandfather." Zhao Ziqiang jumped up and said, "Company Commander Tian, ​​look, should this kid be beaten or not? Grandfather is his grandfather, he is really smart, he really knows." Company Commander Tian really couldn't cheer up the martial spirit, and also laughed. Zhao Ziqiang said, "Your grandfather is your grandfather, don't I know? I'm asking you what your grandfather's name is." He suddenly realized,</p>
<p>Oh and said, "The platoon leader gave him a name, called Li Youdao." Zhao Ziqiang shook his head and said, "You will really drive me to death. No need to say anymore, go down and memorize it well." He stepped back. Behind him stood a thin, black man with a sharp face and constantly turning eyes, which was clearly a more clever appearance. Zhao Ziqiang said, "What's your name?" He snatched the words and said, "My name is Ruan Deming, from Xinxiang, Henan, 16 years old, enlisted in January of the 21st year, guarantor Pi Keshen, grandfather Ruan Shoudao, father Ruan Dahai, left five dou, right three dou." Tian Qing smiled and said, "Walnuts mixed with tofu, a whole piece, this kid recites it backwards and forwards. But what are you busy with? I just asked you what your name is, and you reported everything." Zhao Ziqiang stretched out his hands flat, shook them a few times, and sighed, "I have so many mushrooms in my company, what am I going to do? Go down." That soldier was puzzled, did he say it backwards or was he wrong? He could only walk away dejectedly. Tian Qing laughed and said, "You can hand it over to the squad leader and platoon leader, why are you in such a hurry?" Zhao Ziqiang said, "There has been news of an inspection for many days, do you know when the commander-in-chief is coming? If I don't take care of it, who will be responsible if something goes wrong on that day?" Tian Qing smiled and said, "Let's not talk about this first, let's talk about private matters." As he said that, he took out the letter from his pocket, handed it to Zhao Ziqiang with both hands, made a bow in passing, and repeatedly said, "Congratulations, congratulations." Zhao Ziqiang laughed and said, "Don't joke, I'm so angry, but you're congratulating me." Tian Qing said, "Really, I should congratulate you, the marriage is successful. If you don't believe me, look at this letter." Zhao Ziqiang took the letter in his hand and read it, and couldn't help but raise his hand and scratch his hair for a while, "This... this... are you looking for an unmarried woman, or are you joking with me?"

<h3>Travel Notes of the World's Fair (4)</h3>
<p>— Huang Juemin</p>
<p>(5) Aerial Wire Bridge (Figure 3) is 1,850 feet long and 638 feet high. There is a viewing platform on top, and a steel car weighing 220,000 pounds is suspended in the middle. It can carry 5,000 passengers per hour, going straight from one end to the other. Unfortunately, this bridge was not yet in operation during my two days of visiting the fair, so I did not have the opportunity to visit it in person, which I deeply regret. But only seven days after leaving, I received a radio message on the President Jackson ship on the Pacific Ocean, saying that a sudden gale that day caused great panic to those who climbed the bridge, and I couldn't help but rejoice in my good fortune.</p>
<p>(6) Antarctic Exploration Ship (Figure 4) The ship is made entirely of wood and is not large in scale. Sails and machines were used during navigation. It was used by the American explorer Byrd in 1926 to explore Antarctica. The ship displays all the equipment Byrd brought with him during his exploration. In the autumn of 1931, I personally witnessed Byrd's demeanor and the Antarctic exploration films he shot at the Universal Apartments in New York. Now this ship has become a historical treasure, so I also record it to show the difficulty of a small ship exploring great dangers.</p>
<p>In addition, there are many places in the fair dedicated to entertainment, such as magic tricks, steamer rides, watching big snakes, dwarfs, etc. Because they are products attached to the fair and the time is short, I had to skip them. Even what I have recorded above is only a general situation, and I dare not say it is detailed.</p>
<p>5. Other Miscellany</p>
<p>(1) World's Largest Thermometer The thermometer is 200 feet high, and the numbers in the thermometer are 10 feet high each. It is built from 10 miles of wire and 60 tons of steel plates and is called the Chicago Climate Monument. Whether day or night, the temperature can be seen from all parts of the fair.</p>
<p>(2) Art Exhibition Hall Exhibits art works worth more than 75 million gold dollars. It was collected and borrowed from 25 famous museums and 250 art collections around the world.</p>
<p>(3) Science Congress Launched by the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the World's Fair. The conference period is set from June 19 to June 30. Science giants are invited to visit and hold a conference.</p>
<p>(4) Various Sports Competitions Various track and field, ball games, swimming, boating, etc., are held from May 10 to June 10. Most of the ball games are played at the Chicago Fallen Soldiers Memorial Stadium. The stadium is the largest stadium in the world and can accommodate 100,000 spectators.</p>

<h3>Textbook Dump</h3>
<p>— Zhu</p>
<p>Every year, I only see the price of books that "spread culture" rising. First, the original price was sold at an 80% discount, but now it is sold at the actual price; then the actual price has risen by another 10% or 20%; the reason is that the cost is expensive and the expenses are huge. Unexpectedly, at the beginning of this summer, I suddenly saw several large bookstores posting large-scale advertisements, selling textbooks at a low price: middle school textbooks that were originally sold at the actual price were reduced to 80% of the price, and elementary school textbooks that were originally sold at an 80% discount were reduced to 60% of the price! Textbooks are necessities for students, and although a 20% discount is not a large amount, poor students have actually benefited a lot. On this point, everyone should welcome the big price reduction of textbooks. The editing and printing of primary and secondary textbooks was only done by three major bookstores, Commercial Press, China Bookstore, and World Bookstore, four or five years ago; these three "divided" China's "educational world." They each have "spheres of influence," and although they are "divided," they also "cooperate." It is said that a large amount of capital is required to edit and print primary and secondary textbooks, and it is also said that there must be "clues" to promote textbooks; it is really a big deal, and ordinary bookstores dare not take it upon themselves. Moreover, since "the world" has been determined to be "three," it is even more difficult for other companies to open up a path. However, in the past three or four years, bookstores have also risked engaging in textbooks because there are few "ways out" in business. To date, several companies, including Kaiming, Shenzhou, Beixin, and Dadong, have compiled middle school textbooks. However, it is said that the "basic territory" of textbooks is not in "middle" but in "small." Therefore, two more companies, Kaiming and Dadong, have also added the editing and printing of elementary school textbooks. Now there are five kinds of elementary school textbooks placed in front of elementary school teachers for them to choose and adopt. The big price reduction of textbooks has therefore occurred. According to ordinary habits, if a new cloth shop opens on a street and reduces prices, the old-brand cloth shops on the same street will inevitably also reduce prices greatly. Although bookstores say they are "serving culture," they can hardly escape this iron rule of business competition. In this competition, shops with weak capital and inflexible skills will inevitably suffer losses. This is another iron rule of commerce. However, textbooks are ultimately related to culture and cannot be compared with ordinary commodities; ordinary people also compare the quality of a foot of cloth, and now that they are special "commodities" related to children's education, they should naturally be compared. The right to choose naturally rests with the elementary school teachers. However, teachers who study elementary school education should also take advantage of this big sale to make a fair criticism of the books of each company and provide elementary school teachers with a reference for selection. Only in this way can the big sale of textbooks at a 60% discount not become a purely commercial competition, and then can it be said that it is truly beneficial to children.</p>
<p>In short, there is progress with competition, but shoddy products often become more rampant due to competition; therefore, impartial and just criticism is even more necessary!</p>
<h3>Root</h3>
<p>— Ye Rong</p>
<p>Root packed a few pieces of her own clothes. With tear-filled eyes, she pointed to a pile of ragged clothes on the bed and told me: these are Dad's, these are Little Four's, all mended. I'll keep a few pieces of my own clothes, and tomorrow I'll alter them for Little Four to wear. At this moment, tears fell from her face like a broken string of pearls, like rain.</p>
<p>I sighed and wanted to comfort her, but what could I say? What could I say? I had sold my own daughter as if she were a piece of rag. My throat felt choked, as if something was stuck in it, and I couldn't breathe. A layer of faint tears blurred my eyes. Root wiped her tears and went back and forth, tidying things up. It seemed she wanted to get everything in order so that I would never have to worry; it also seemed like she was saying goodbye to everything.</p>
<p>I sat in a daze, as if I were in a trance, not thinking anything, not saying anything. My heart was completely still.</p>
<p>Since her mother died, followed by years of floods and war, we couldn't harvest anything from the fields. The whole family was exhausted, struggling with hunger every day. Yet, things got worse day by day, and now I had to sell my gentle and sensible daughter to pay off our debts. Heaven, what kind of world is this?</p>
<p>Why was I so confused and sold her for eighty yuan? She is my daughter, my own flesh and blood!</p>
<p>But it's too late to regret it now. Didn't I accept ten yuan as a deposit?…</p>
<p>I couldn't help but recall her good qualities. Without her, how could we have survived these years of hardship? She managed the household, looked after her brothers, and sometimes had to endure my bad temper. A poor girl, not even sixteen, took on all the hardships her mother left behind. She had to go here and there to find food for herself and her brothers. She had to step forward with tears in her eyes, to listen to the insults of the debt collectors on my behalf, and to plead with them. She even had to… She had been my daughter for more than ten years, and never had a single good day. Now, I have to sell her to pay off debts! How can I go on living without her after I sell her and lose her?</p>
<p>Little Four ran in from outside, naked and covered in dust. Root pulled him towards her and then let him go. She said,</p>
<p>"Little Four, come wash up." After washing, I'll be gone. Who will wash you? "She immediately scooped a basin of water and began to wash him.</p>
<p>Little Four asked: "Where are you going? Can I go with you?"</p>
<p>Root lowered her head and answered him after a long time: she was going out to pick mud beans and he didn't need to go. Later, she whispered to him, telling him not to run around, to listen to Dad, and not to go with Wang Agui to the mud pit to bathe.</p>
<p>After washing Little Four, she took out a short shirt and put it on him, then led him to the kitchen. I couldn't help but feel heartbroken looking at her back. I raised my hand and thumped my chest a few times. I wished my body would explode and destroy the whole world…</p>
<p>After Root cooked lunch, we ate and cleaned up the dishes. After hesitating for a while, she asked me:</p>
<p>"Dad, am I leaving now? Didn't Uncle Zhou say that after we ate, Dad would take me?…" she said softly, but without crying. Her voice was like a sharp knife, each word cutting into my heart. How could I let her go? How could I personally lead her, lead my Root, to hand her over to someone else? After a moment of silence, I said:</p>
<p>"Don't go then. Root, don't go." The voice seemed to burst from my heart. She stared at me with both eyes, without a sound. Then I saw tears falling from her face like broken beads again. She covered her face and sobbed.</p>
<p>Zhou Baoxian suddenly stood at the door and said, "Let's go, it's getting late. Didn't I say we had to catch the bus today?"</p>
<h3>A World Literary History in "Silhouette Collection"</h3>
<p>— Can Yue</p>
<p>Recently, after finishing the History of the Development of European Literature and European Art of the Twentieth Century, I became quite interested in literary history. It just so happened that the Zhonghua Book Company was heavily advertising the "Guohuo" (National Product) World Literary History, volumes one and two, in neat columns of small type. In the "Collection of Praises," so-called famous scholars and experts were singing its praises (whether they were excerpts from letters is unknown), so I bought a copy to see the brilliant materialist research methods of Yu Mutao, this Chinese Sinclair disciple.</p>
<p>Opening the first page, in a preface, the opening line was "This is the saying of a 'great man'!" It scared me into a cold sweat. Who is this so-called great man? There are so many of them. It's just unsettling. Then, the author says a series of words about the Chinese publishing industry, which he finds unsatisfactory. The reason is that "there are virtually no decent works in the translation and writing of literary history." So he offers this "decent" world literary history.</p>
<p>It turns out that this book is written based on two "famous sayings." It startled me again: What are these "famous sayings?" They are:</p>
<p>"Literature is a reflection of social life."</p>
<p>"Only with the October Revolution was there modern Russian literature."</p>
<p>The author worships these so-called "famous sayings" so decisively that I initially suspected it was an old manuscript written in 1925 or 1926. I hurriedly checked the date, but it was indeed written on "September 23, 1932."</p>
<p>But having quoted "great men" and relied on "famous sayings," one must complete the task. I spent the whole day reading it. As I closed the book and wanted to sleep, I suddenly understood. I took Zhao Jingshen's A Short History of Chinese Literature, Zheng Zhenduo's An Outline of Literature, and Karl Radek's History of the Chinese Revolutionary Movement and compared them carefully. I discovered that the method of Mr. Yu's "materialist research" in this "decent" work is: History of the Chinese Revolutionary Movement + A Short History of Chinese Literature + An Outline of Literature + Controversy on Chinese Social History (Antique Junk Stall), volumes one and two. A World Literary History in "Silhouette Collection."</p>
<p>If you don't believe me, Radek, though a "devil," has no way to testify. Zheng Zhenduo is far away in Beijing and cannot be consulted. But Zhao Jingshen, old brother, if you have read this "decent" work, you will surely understand.</p>
<p>Although Zheng Zhenduo's An Outline of Literature is crude and has many omissions, one cannot help but admire his perseverance. Mr. Yu's great work is clipped and copied from everywhere, but one cannot help but admire his boldness.</p>
<p>Such a brilliant hand, how can it not be praised? I am not talented, but I must express it and attach it to that "Collection of Praises"!</p>

<h3>Ordinary Affairs (12)</h3>
<p>— 𣽃 Guo Sun</p>
<p>Zhi Guang passed the old site of the Dananmen city gate. Looking west, he could already see the iron sign of the Changxing Construction Company erected high on the roof of the building. Although the "Nian'an" electrical advertising on the sign did not appear very bright during the day, the tall iron frame could already show the prosperity of Changxing. Walking a little further, he saw several workers standing outside the factory gate, looking up at the sky idly.</p>
<p>The factory was so silent that it almost made one suspect it was a Sunday morning. Materials lay in their respective places, and tools were arranged in their respective positions. The only things moving were three or five workers living in the factory, going back and forth to get water from the large tap. The "pu si deng deng" sound of Zhi Guang's bicycle made them look up. Zhi Guang nodded and smiled at them before turning a corner and getting off his bike in front of the office.</p>
<p>Three or five minutes later, several representatives of the workers had received the message and came to talk to Zhi Guang:</p>
<p>"Mr. Zhang," said a representative surnamed Lin, "the matter of us helping Zhabei last night still depends on you and Mr. Yao to smooth things over."</p>
<p>"That's right," Zhi Guang said, "I came specifically for this matter. But the factory has helped Zhabei several times before."</p>
<p>"We know that very well. But as we see the situation now, Zhabei's need for help is getting more urgent by the day."</p>
<p>"What kind of supplies are needed?" asked a representative surnamed Qiu. "We hear the usage is getting greater every day. We hear the supplies the factory had stored up are being used up faster and faster. The people from the factory who went there all said that…" Hearing this, Zhi Guang's myopic eyes, hidden under thick eyebrows, almost wrinkled until there were no gaps. Only his mouth, like two half-opened lotus leaves, and the row of white jade-like teeth inside could express Zhi Guang's intelligence. He asked:</p>
<p>"How many people from the factory went?"</p>
<p>"We don't have an exact number," Mr. Lin said, "but more people from our masonry group went than from the carpentry group."</p>
<p>"There were quite a few from the carpentry group too," Mr. Qiu interrupted, "except for those doing fine woodworking."</p>
<p>Then they took turns telling Zhi Guang many names and the many things these names had seen or done: heroic, passionate, heartbroken, joyful, making others unable to disbelieve, and unwilling to disbelieve, yet they had to listen quietly. Zhi Guang started by listening quietly, but later the power of these reports made him think of two stories he had almost witnessed when he was working in France,</p>
<p>At that time, the European War had not yet stopped. He was working in an iron factory in southern France. There were more than a hundred Chinese workers in this factory, and in another nearby factory, there were more than two hundred African black people doing unloading and carrying work. One day, probably on a major commemorative holiday when everyone was resting, some of these two different colored workers were playing in the wild. They misunderstood each other and clashed, and in less than half a day, it turned into a large-scale brawl. Because of their small number, the Chinese workers saw that they could not hold on. They were being forced by the black people to the edge of a large lake, seemingly in a backwater situation. Suddenly, eight or ninety more Chinese workers came from the side and attacked the black people fiercely. With great difficulty, those Chinese workers on the edge of the lake escaped danger. Later, they thanked the other group, and only then did they learn that the reinforcements were all Annamese workers. Two or three days later, the local judicial official investigated the three kinds of people who were injured in this brawl from all sides and determined that they were all the main culprits who caused the trouble, and summoned them to court… When the judge questioned the Annamese workers, he particularly rebuked them for not minding their own business, and said that they should be severely punished. The Annamese workers first pointed to the faces of the Chinese workers in court, then pointed to their own faces, and said to the judge: "These are all the same, even if you increase the punishment, we will not regret it!" Later, they pointed to the faces of those black people, and shook their hands towards their own faces, saying: "These are not the same!" … At that time, the people who knew about this matter regarded it as a matter worth studying.</p>

<h3>Near-Term Gold Exchange Rate Discovered</h3>
<p>A Short-Lived Reaction</p>
<p>After opening lower in the morning, a sharp squeeze led to a strong rebound. After the market began to decline, it eventually returned to a slight decrease of three yuan and three jiao. Although the gold market opened lower yesterday morning, it gradually rose after the opening, and the squeeze was extremely fierce. The quoted price was inverted by about ten yuan. The market first fell and then recovered. Early in the morning, both British and American silver prices rose, and the exchange rate rose frequently.</p>
<p>The forward silver price on the Gold and Silver Exchange rose from 1.5 fen to 1.85 fen. American cotton prices fell, while stocks rose. The raw silk market fell from over seventy yuan to sixty-five or sixty-six yuan. After opening, the banks forcefully supported it, and the situation stabilized. The HSBC exchange rate was announced, with the British pound at 25 and the US dollar at 875, already rising and recovering. Then, due to aggressive short covering, the gold price successively broke through the seventy and eighty yuan marks. The quoted price had already been exceeded, and the midday close rose again to over ninety yuan. However, the banks had no intention to sell. The afternoon session opened lower and fell further as the banks unloaded, but people were unsettled. However, those who took advantage of the low price to buy were strong, and with the two declines in Bombay totaling three annas, it was still able to recover in the end. It was still low at the close. It was found that the situation was extremely sharp throughout the day. The morning actually created a record of the lowest opening price and the highest closing price. This was also a reaction after continuous downstream losses. The industry was seeking to settle US dollars, and the banks were particularly sluggish. The swap price was approaching, and they had to cover their positions. In addition, under the aggressive purchase of speculator Wu, the sentiment was extremely firm. This swap happened to fall on a Saturday and was held earlier in the morning. Given today's situation, it seems difficult for the bulls to obtain a favorable premium, but it depends on the difference between the HSBC exchange rate and the quoted price of the US dollar. The raw gold price is subject to an additional two hundred and twenty yuan, which already has a source. The swap premium for July and August is seven yuan. The market situation of the day is recorded as follows:</p>

<h3>Foreign Loan Additions and Reductions are Minimal</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of this month, the financial market has been characterized by the summer slowdown in various industries, sluggish circulation of commercial goods, and minimal inflow and outflow of funds. Consequently, collections, settlements, and transactions have been scarce. The foreign loan interest rate has fluctuated based on the complexity of demand, and as there is no significant need, there is no tightness or slackness. Therefore, the daily rate has been between 5 and 6 points. Yesterday morning and afternoon, it remained at 6 points, a slight improvement of 1 point compared to the previous day. Furthermore, there was no additional liquidity injection. Most were settled on a per-hundred basis. Loan interest note transactions were also less frequent than in previous days. Morning session transfers totaled over 4.1 million, with new transactions exceeding 900,000. Afternoon session transactions were over 30,000. Transactions at the small clearing house totaled over 700,000, and foreign mortgage loan transactions were 900,000. The amount of banknotes withdrawn and issued was over 1.3 million. Bank collections and settlements were particularly quiet. Foreign banks' collections and settlements of bills and funds were silver totaling 700,000 to 800,000 and foreign currency totaling 1.2 million to 1.3 million. Various mortgage loans, telegraphic transfers, and merchandise collections and settlements totaled silver 2.78 million and foreign currency 2.7 million. Special collections and settlements totaled silver 1.2 million, while warehouse transactions were silver 300,000 and foreign currency 600,000.

<h3>Silver and Copper Conversion Remains Quiet as Before</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Jiangnan small foreign silver coin remained unchanged from the previous day. The price was 842 yuan for both the morning and afternoon sessions, and the trading trend was sluggish.

<h3>Securities and Public Bonds Show Signs of Weakness</h3>
<p>Hedging and long positions exiting are the main reasons, but overall, gains still outweigh losses. Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange and the market remained generally positive, as hopes for a peaceful resolution to the situation had not completely vanished. Although major players in the market continued to show signs of selling, a drastic change was not expected immediately, and a rebound was likely, resulting in a period of fluctuation. At the opening auction in the morning, various sectors remained firm. Although some Number 50 bonds were sold, it was not enough to stop the rise in prices, and new highs were seen for several stocks. Short-term financial public bonds, which usually saw little trading, suddenly experienced a demand of several hundred thousand in the early trading, pushing prices up by one yuan and several jiao, with the highest price reaching 66.4 yuan and 4 jiao. This was considered an anomaly and not indicative of the overall trend. In the second session, most stocks continued to show upward movement, but after 11:30 AM, long positions in Numbers 11, 32, and 50 bonds began to exit, gradually weakening prices. Salt taxes were no exception, falling by three to five jiao. Despite this, overall, gains still outweighed losses, but the trend showed signs of weakening. Sentiment remained high, making a sudden shift to pessimism unlikely, as the slight price fluctuations were mainly due to long positions exiting and hedging activities. Short sellers remained a minority, and the future outlook was expected to be a period of fluctuation. The total trading volume was 10,065,200 yuan, including 12,000 yuan in spot transactions and 3,310,000 yuan in futures for Tongfeng tax, 970,000 yuan for troop reduction, 1,100,000 yuan for 19 Customs bonds, 1,965,000 yuan for 20-year Customs bonds, 1,510,000 yuan for 96 bonds, and varying amounts from over ten thousand to over four hundred thousand for other issues.</p>
<h3>Key New York Stocks Continue to Advance</h3>
<p>The New Feng Foreign Firm reported that on Thursday (the 13th), the New York stock market saw continued stability with strong advances in "wet" stocks, superior railroad stocks, utilities, and specialty stocks. Trading was active, with a total volume of 7,450,000 shares. The market appeared poised for further gains, with steel, railroad, auto, and petroleum stocks performing well. Wheat prices weakened due to long position liquidations, but the market position was healthier than before. Cotton prices also fell due to long liquidations and slightly improved conditions in the southern drought areas, but there was widespread confidence that the cotton acreage reduction plan would ultimately succeed, leading to strong buying. Silver prices rose sharply by about one and a half points following private telegrams from London stating that the Birtman Committee was about to announce agreement on export restrictions. The Dow Jones indices are listed below:</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Weakened</h3>
<p>Due to the hot weather, yarn trading will be suspended after next week. The yarn market is flat and weak, with softening momentum due to slow actual sales. Various sectors remain lackluster, and 8,000 bales of old stock from July and August are up for auction, with tax bills that cannot be extended, resulting in an estimated loss of about two yuan per bale. Arbitrage is not working, and sentiment is weak, but those outside the industry still have a strong desire to buy due to the low prices. The market is attempting to stabilize.</p>
<h3>Yarn Drops Six Jiao</h3>
<p>The opening of the futures market fell following the decline in foreign cotton. Sentiment was weak, with each month falling by one yuan to one yuan and thirty-four jiao.

<h3>Old Cotton Bulls Take a Hard Line</h3>
<p>The cotton market turned firm due to the large rebound in US cotton, and most forecasts expect continued gains in US cotton. As a result, buyers took a strong stance. However, the sharp rise in silver prices has led to flat demand from cotton mills. The future trend will continue to depend on US cotton.</p>
<h3>Firm and Popular Futures Cotton</h3>
<p>The opening of the Zhengzhou futures market fell following the decline in foreign cotton, with each month down one jiao. In the afternoon, old cotton bulls tightened their grip, pushing prices up by three jiao and five fen, followed by another one jiao. Total trading volume for the day was 37,800 dan.

<h3>US Cotton Falls, British and Indian Cotton Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market was mixed due to the possibility of a correction. Prices rose initially due to buying on Wall Street, but then weakened due to long position liquidations. As a result, spot prices fell by 15 points and futures prices fell by 14 to 17 points. The Liverpool cotton market saw spot prices rise by 24 points and futures prices rise by 20 to 23 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 17 points. The Bombay cotton market initially followed the rise in US cotton, but then softened due to profit-taking and corrective selling.

<h3>Grain Market: Rice Firm in the South, Weak in the North</h3>
<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, sources came from over 40 numbers. Changbang, Sutongbang, Nangang and other thick japonica rice and Doyang pointed rice were well received by the local shops, but due to the hot weather, visitors had no intention of stockpiling beyond replenishing shortages, so although sellers uniformly called for price increases, prices ultimately did not rise, with only a few fen of gains. As a result, the market remained flat. As for the procurement of thin rice from Qingjiao, Songjiang, and Sibang by Tianjin traders remained active, but not as robust as yesterday. Yinbianyuan was also seen to be tightening.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, sources from Hexia and other routes were 16 or 17 numbers. White japonica rice sales were sluggish and prices were again down slightly. Early thin rice was stable, but medium quality rice showed signs of weakness. Yangjian and Dujian rice arrived in small quantities and sales were sluggish, down a small number of fen. Buke tips were slightly weak. Yinbianyuan was slightly tighter by a few fen.</p>
<h3>Mills Compete to Replenish This Month's Flour</h3>
<p>|| Outside traders compete to purchase forward contracts || Yesterday, the flour market showed signs of weakness in the morning after opening, as quotations for foreign wheat showed a small decline of three or four jiao for Zhima wheat and a few fen for Kan wheat. Given the rebound from the previous day and the flat sales, opening prices were also down by a fraction of a fen, with the lowest price for this month at two yuan, three jiao, two fen, two li and a half. But mills became active to cover their short-term needs, so the market became stable. By the afternoon opening, prices suddenly soared, because mills believed that inland wheat prices had not eased and rose as soon as there was movement. Although the recent sales of flour have not been very smooth, the blended price will inevitably result in a loss, so they let go and fully replenished. Only the market atmosphere in this month was exceptionally good. Forward contracts were also enthusiastically bought by outside traders, and gradually increased. However, Tianjin traders took the opportunity to sell back, in quantities of over 100,000 bags, which was also an incredible event. As a result, this month rebounded by one fen and two li and a half compared to the previous day, January rose by one fen and two li and a half, September rose by one fen and seven li and a half, October and November rose by one fen and a half, and December rose by two fen.</p>
<p>Inland Quotes Rise Sharply</p>
<h3>Both Futures and Spot Wheat Stiffen</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat futures market in the morning, prices had once eased, with Zhima wheat quotations down a small amount of three or four jiao and Kan wheat a few fen, so opening prices were down a fen or two for near-term contracts and stable for far-term contracts. Later, because the need to cover short positions was very urgent, opening prices rose again. By the afternoon opening, inland quotes had risen sharply, and holders of expensive goods were reluctant to sell cheaply. Medium-quality goods did not meet standards, and those who sought to arbitrage could only recover their costs, so the market felt particularly good and buying was very active. Looking at the subsequent situation, if the mill demand is good, prices are expected to continue to rise. As a result, this month rose by six fen compared to the previous day, August rose by four fen, September rose by five fen, October rose by four fen, November rose by six fen, and December rose by four fen. Spot wheat prices stiffened due to rising prices in the production areas and holders of goods were reluctant to sell. High-quality goods rose by an estimated three to five fen, while medium-quality goods remained flat. The opening prices were: Kaiming Guang wheat at three yuan, eight jiao, four fen, Gaoyou wheat at three yuan, seven jiao, three fen, Yangzhou wheat at three yuan, six jiao, eight fen, and second quality at six jiao and a half, Shuangfeng wheat at three yuan and three jiao, Liuhe wheat at three yuan, five jiao, seven fen, and second quality at five jiao and three fen, Baoying wheat at three yuan, six jiao, eight fen, Daqiao wheat at three yuan, seven jiao and a half, Chongming wheat at three yuan, four jiao, two fen, Nanjing wheat at three yuan, four jiao and a half, and Hezhou wheat at three yuan, four jiao, one fen, and second quality at three jiao, Penglai wheat at three yuan, four jiao and a half, and second quality at four jiao, with a total opening of 6,000 bags.</p>
<h3>Foreign-Traded Rapeseed Opens at Five Taels and a Half</h3>
<p>Although the rapeseed trade in Tianjin has not been very lively recently, the market atmosphere has been uniformly tight, mainly because production area prices are high and difficult to process, and local hoarders are insistent on not selling. Yesterday, the Hengxingtai Oil Mill sold five to six thousand bags of Wuhu goods at a price of five taels and five qian (equivalent to seven yuan and seven jiao in silver dollars), which was handled by the Yonghe Foreign Firm. The subsequent trend is still expected to be favorable.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Silk Mills Cut Work Hours Due to Summer Heat, Changzhou Summer Harvest is Poor and Prices are Low</h3>
<p>In Changzhou, the farmers in various towns and villages who raise summer silkworms this year are most numerous in the eastern part of the region. Cocoon production is only about two-tenths of the spring cocoon production. Few silk cocoon exchanges open, and cocoon prices range from a high of 3,000 yuan to a low of 20 yuan. Silkworm farmers suffer considerable losses.</p>
<h3>All Silk Mills in the City Reduce Working Hours Due to Summer Heat</h3>
<p>Every summer, the city's silk mills reduce working hours by half. Starting yesterday, all 55 silk mills in the city only work half a day in the morning and stop work in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Silk Sales in Shanghai Are Nearly Stagnant</h3>
<p>Recently, exchange rate fluctuations have been severe, and overseas silk prices have been uniformly weak. Although European firms have been trying to push up prices, Chinese silk merchants have maintained a firm attitude, and the market is nearly stagnant. Yesterday, only American firms and others replenished 20 bales of Shanghai white factory warp and 20 bales of gray warp, with prices remaining flat. French firms were closed for vacation and there was no market.</p>
<h3>Large-Scale Wuyuan Tea Businesses Have Opened</h3>
<p>Large-scale green tea businesses on the northern route of Wuyuan have been shipping goods to Shanghai one after another in recent days. Jinlong Foreign Firm has opened, with prices at 75 yuan, which is not much higher or lower compared to last year's silver prices. Transactions for Zhenmei Gongxi and other items continue to be brisk, and there have also been sporadic transactions for Fengmei Pearl Tea. However, sales of Zhenmei tea, both cored and ordinary, have become sluggish. As tea from all routes has been selling well for a long time, sentiment is extremely stable, and there are no signs of price declines in the market. As for Qifu black tea, the source has been cut off. It is said that Russian firms still have huge sales expectations, and the situation has not changed much.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Coarse Granulated and White Sugar Prices Drop Again by Half a Jiao</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw a further decline in Customs Gold, a rise in Dutch exchange rates, and continued weakness in standard gold. The association set the price for 24 sugar and ordinary white granulated sugar at the initial session at a drop of one jiao, with 100 bags trading at 20 yuan and three jiao. In the later session, it dropped another five fen, with 300 bags trading at two jiao and a half. 20th-grade medium granulated white sugar was at 19 and a half yuan, and KD mark Dutch sugar was at 16 yuan, one jiao and a half, but no deals were made. If exchange rates and Customs Gold cannot be stabilized, the weakness is expected to continue. The Taikoo Sugar B mark was also down five fen, at 21 yuan and four jiao. In the official exchange, only Chao Bang opened with over 100 bags of Huanggang Qing at 13 yuan and eight jiao, followed by five jiao for lower quality. Based on costs, there are still losses of several jiao, so the market is still tight.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: New Golden Daylily Exchanges Drop Again</h3>
<p>New golden daylily flowers, yesterday, the Zhen Bang firms continued to open with over 100 pieces, with Daxing vegetables at 19 yuan, down another one yuan compared to the second exchange, followed by 18 yuan and six jiao, and ordinary at 18 yuan to 17 yuan. Official exchanges also followed the decline, and the dispute over the Guang Bang market scales has been resolved, and trading has begun.</p>
<h3>Woolen Fabrics and Sichuan Sales Start</h3>
<p>The woolen fabric association's market atmosphere has been good recently, with Sichuan merchants stationed in Shanghai all having intake. Lower-grade plain thick woolen fabric, plain-colored Huate woolen fabric, and colorful shoe felt woolen fabric are particularly in demand. Since Sichuan is far from Shanghai, purchasers have no choice but to take action in advance. Yesterday, it was heard that the Sichuan merchants had opened over 200 pieces of woolen fabric and products, with domestically produced wide and tight camel wool occupying over 50 pieces, with transaction prices of one yuan and three jiao and one yuan and six jiao.</p>

<h3>The Longing for "First Prize"</h3>
<p>— Bin Fu</p>
<p>If someone is deeply studying the Chinese national character, I believe that the recent "modern trend" prevailing in Chinese society cannot be ignored, otherwise, it will be difficult to have a deep understanding of the Chinese nation. What is the "modern trend"? This "modern trend" is neither the Three Principles of the People, nor nationalism, nor anarchism, but the "what if I won the first prize" reverie that often surges in people's minds recently.</p>
<p>Although I dare not say that every Chinese is fantasizing about "what if I won the first prize", I am afraid that there are not a few people who are fantasizing about "what if I won the first prize". Because in fact, millions or hundreds of thousands of lottery tickets have found their way, which is enough to see people's enthusiasm for buying lottery tickets. Since there is the motivation to buy tickets, who would not have the thought of "what if I won the first prize"?</p>
<p>The date of the aviation lottery draw is getting closer and closer. The aviation industry is fiddling with the abacus, planning how to use this "500,000" to operate another business! The worker in the factory is thinking about how to take the money to a large hotel to open a room and have fun. The bank clerk is smiling at the lottery ticket, thinking about how to buy a car and take revenge on the section chief and director. The contributor puts down the pen, thinking about how to use tens of thousands of yuan to run a magazine, so as to avoid the embarrassment of being ridiculed. The rickshaw puller also thinks that if the lottery ticket he bought together with his companions for a dime wins the first prize, he can get 5,000 yuan, and then he doesn't have to do the legwork of a rickshaw puller anymore. People of all classes are dreaming of their own interests, and people of all classes are longing for the "beautiful" gold. However, people of all classes spend their blood-stained money or savings, pursuing the "beautiful" gold hidden in the "first prize" like catching jade crabs in golden snails, but the "beautiful" gold hidden in the "first prize" will not and cannot fall in love with every individual who buys lottery tickets. This group of pitiful worms who rush to it and drool are just cherishing a "one-sided love" for the "golden" girl who is like a grain of sand in the Ganges. Here, the Chinese people's cleverness in gambling and speculation is nakedly exposed, but at the same time, it also shows the Chinese people's stupidity in not understanding the "probability".</p>
<p>The day of the lottery draw will arrive in the blink of an eye. When that time comes, the thermometer temperature may drop a little due to the public's disappointment.</p>
