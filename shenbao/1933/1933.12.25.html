<h3 id="c28">解决康藏糾紛之機 <a href="#c28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>— 舒</p>
<p>西藏自達賴喇嘛突然圓寂之後。即現解决康藏糾紛之先機。中央此次如果處置得當。則歷年危機四伏之藏局。可即歸於安定。而西部邊陲。亦可從此漸趨鞏固矣。</p>
<p>夫西藏問題之起。緣於清末趙爾豐以嚴刑繁法統治藏民。當時藏人雖懾於兵威。不敢驟然反抗。然强隣伺隙。土人思亂。至趙氏去位以後。藏邊即次第變動。民元以還。隱然另成一政治系統。惟當時駐錫後藏之班禪額爾德。受前清陶鎔甚深。民國以來。内向之心。絕不改變。與達賴喇嘛之親英政策相衝突。且班禪一意潛修。對於政治甚爲疏遠。於是大權落於達賴之手。而班禪遂不能不遠遊中國矣。最近達賴於以往之親英政策。似已有所覺悟。對中央政府。仍有表示歸向之意。故達賴死而班禪回藏。當無甚問題。不過據電所傳。班禪尙待加以考慮耳。</p>
<p>當此達賴圓寂班禪未歸之際。青黄不接。藏民旣多歸依宗敎。而藏衛又屬政敎不分之區。人心浮動。自在意中。加以南隣印度。爲英國之寳庫。彼早已着着布置。顯然有乘機肆其兼併之野心。惟使隣近西藏之西康省。能勵精圖治。使藏人有所觀感。漢民得安其生業者。則無論强隣如何狡獪。西藏尙不至驟然離貳也。今吾人試一考察川省内政。即可知四川在此割據之局面下。各軍閥祗知如何守其防區。如何搜括其財富。對眼前之整個川局。何嘗稍加注意。更何有於國防。何惜乎西藏。而駐在康定一帶之軍隊。又多缺乏知識。幷尋常之軍風紀亦付缺如對一般漢人。且大擺其架子。大顯其威風。則對藏民更無論矣。是故駐軍與土人之間。惡感愈積愈深。法律旣難於持平。反亂之動機。遂由此醞釀。趙爾豐之嚴峻辦法。在統一時代或尙可有效於一時。一旅之師或即足以統馭前後藏。現則時移勢易。藏人已不似前此之易與。在軍事上彼亦有新式火器。足與川軍爲敵。在知識上對於政治。亦已逐漸瞭解。舊時之顢頇政策。已不能敵他人之溫言欺騙。中央政府以道路遠隔。交通阻滯。固有鞭長莫及之槪。差幸親英之主持者。今已無力續行其政策。而傾心内向之班禪喇嘛。又將返藏。主持敎務。整理行政。則康藏糾紛解决之機。或在於斯。</p>
<p>於此新舊絕續局勢轉換之時。中樞運籌帷幄。將簡派大員赴藏安撫。竊謂於扶助班禪回藏之外。幷當注意下列諸點。藉以收攬西藏之人心。鞏固邊陲之國防。</p>
<p>第一·治藏要着。先要安定四川。蓋四川爲西藏之緊鄰。西康雖已劃省。但實際仍爲川省附庸。凡四川一切政治上壞影響。皆是以沾染西康。而西康之腐惡。又極易爲藏人所輕視。故四川之整理。爲治藏要圖。且川民望治甚切。祗須中樞有確切之辦法。審愼堅决以臨之。則安定川局。亦非難事。</p>
<p>第二·治藏應有特殊政策。西藏受黄敎之淘冶。自明迄今。已歷五百餘年。殆已習成第二天性。其一般經濟形態。又屬農業經濟之初期。加以四圍高山環繞。知識浸潤之機緣絕少。現在内蒙古且已許其自治。西藏亦何常不可在中央指導之下。試行其合於地方需求之自治。使藏民得宗敎上之自由。以獲政治上之安定。</p>
<p>第三·注意南北兩大鄰國之外交·無論爲英國爲蘇聯。皆集注視線於新藏。今新疆政變未息。而西藏問題。又須重新清理。吾人對於已經揷足新藏之鄰國。應與之更新外交上之途徑。匪特疆界須清。政治關係。尤應明白確定。務令西北邊防。不再蹈以往之覆轍。</p>

<p>在這些問題之中、第一是陸軍部與財政部的對立　第二是海軍部與財政部的對立、打開天窗說亮話、就是軍閥與財閥的對立、照尋常的情形、齋藤内閣旣然包含着如此巨大的矛盾、則内閣蔣不免於崩潰、或由軍部出來領導組閣、或者財閥起而爲金融的寡頭獨裁、但事實都不曾實現、因爲軍閥也不敢輕於一擲、惹起國内度的不安、財閥更没有壓服軍閥的實力、過所以終於勉强找得了暫時緩和的途徑陸軍所提預算、固已大加削减、海軍方面所謂的第二次補充計劃的實施、主力艦船的改裝、飛行隊的增設等三大原則、雖有非要通過不可的說法、齋藤内閣幾乎要因此而不能維持、但結果還是妥恊了、在本月初、閣議所决定明年度預算支出的數目、爲二十一億一千萬日金、比較今年的二十二億三千九百萬日金、減少了一億二千八百餘萬、然則所謂預算膨脹這句話、豈不是不確實、殊不知這當中還有原故呢、就是從明年起把新特别會計獨立分開了、通信事業所屬的特别會計、有一億九千萬日金、另自算一筆賬、如果把這一筆加進預算裏去、則明年度的預算、要比今年還多六千二百萬日金、支出總額就會是二十三億日金、爲空前未有的巨大數字、</p>
<p>假如以三年前的情形來　、一九三一年的支出預算、祇有十四億八千八百萬日金、這三年之間、竟一躍而增加了八億日金、在財政上是如何巨大的變化啊、我們再就支出方面的新增加的内容看看、經常費與臨時費、合計有七億二千三百萬日金、在這種龐大的增加額數之中、公債增加了的利息和償還外債、因日金匯兌跌落的虧損、必須支出一億一千萬日金、所謂時局匡救費、合内務農林兩部、也不過五千二百萬、其餘的五億六千餘萬日金、大半都用在軍事上去了、在陸軍部的新規要求增加數目、計二億四千八百萬日金、海軍部二億三千四百萬、陸海軍雙方合計、有四億八千三百萬日金、其餘各項新要求、總計其所得、不過七千八百多萬日金、這就是日本所謂國防的表現、</p>
<p>如果把軍事方面的經常費與臨時費合計起來、則陸軍軍費計四億四千八百萬、海軍軍事費計四億八千八百萬、陸海軍費合計、九億三千六百萬、占歲出總額的百分之四十四有奇、這眞是驚人的非常時期的軍費呀、誰能說日本不在積極備戰呢、</p>
<p>如此顢頇、非恃日本國内一般人民、在街頭屋角時有不平的議論、所以危險思想、總是不斷的發展、對這樣盲目的軍事冒險、漸有普遍化的反抗運動、而且資本家方面、也有不少的反對聲浪因此本月九日陸海軍方面、特别以談話方式發表聲明、說一九三六年的危機、說軍部並不犧牲庶民階級的利益、說國防是應該而且必需、可是效果何如、還看不見、在公平的觀察、也以爲那是等於神國之說、幷無濟於日本民間的恐慌、（十二月十九日於東京）</p>

<p>至信陽下車、翌晨六時、轉乘汽車、東去經羅山、午後三時、始抵潢川、入城受檢查、雖係夾衣棉被、亦須一一摸索、查完全車箱物、費時時餘、其意蓋側重於毒品也、有河分城爲二、中聯長橋、市中街人素冷落、時値某部所發鈔票、驟失信用、市面金融、紊亂異常、舖店宣佈算賬停業者、數亦不少、來往市上、軍人占最多數、婦女百不一二覯、偶有跚跚出入商舖者、後必緊隨持槍動務兵數人、引起鄕人圍觀追視者尤衆、婦女絕少外出、北地習俗使然、抑因一時之特殊原故、未便探悉爲憾、所謂特貨、則由濟理湖北特貨駐豫專員辦事處、指定某一公棧、獨家銷售、若私賣私買不貼特稅標語者、一經查獲、除照禁烟條例辦法外、且没收犯者之資産、又有人私販海洛英（傳者謂仍是土膏非眞海洛英）被獲者、已行槍决、此皆於壁上新貼告示、觀而得之、</p>
<p>關於潢川新村建設事、曾往總部探詢、未得頭緒、承轉介縣府、始悉所謂新村計劃、聞乃河南中原公司股東胡石青所擬、當局雖有採納意、迄未實行、所傳潢川設有新村辦事處、亦全屬子虛之談、卽以移民政策論、劉總司令預計經費需四百餘萬、現僅領獲十萬、故亦無法着手云云、千里跋涉來此、突聞此言、一團高興、頓成冷氣冰心、國人素喜誇大虛張、常以白紙空言自炫、此次情形、恰係如此、記者不甘虛此一行、特請縣府發給護照一紙、改作收復區瓣設縣治「經扶」之視察、所得情况、略紀如次、</p>
<p>經扶縣治、原爲光山所屬之新集鎭、失陷二年餘、於去年秋、經豫主席劉峙部湯師克復、蔣總司令以地勢需要、改建縣治、故以劉號經扶、而名其縣、該地四面皆山、北距光山·羅山、東距商城·立煌（原係有名赤區金寨、衛立煌軍克復、始以衛號改縣）、南距麻城·黄安、均各百數十里、有鞏固之石城一座、多居膏紳地主、早爲赤匪垂涎、且欲攫得其地、以便聯絡商城黄安紅軍、爲進窺武漢之基、十九年七日、僞紅四軍曁廿五軍部隊、大舉圍攻、逾月未下、匪乃一面穴地而轟北城、砰然巨聲、塵土大起、城垣倒塌數丈、城内民防團隊、咸傾力注意於此、不料匪採聲東擊西之法、一面又由南梯城而入、全城遂陷、事先爲防守鞏固計、各城門滿塞木石布袋、倉猝無法取逃、人人皆慴伏城中、無一安全倖免、後匪爲實行主義、鎭壓反動、一般被目爲士豪劣紳者、捕殺懲治、易如探囊、受禍較他處爲烈、其故卽在此、</p>
<p>匪先襲城、大小數次、爲時年餘、城堅力守、卒未得逞、此次被陷、蓋恐難以久佔、乃拆毁城垣、預爲他日復攻之地步、幷審勢度情、建豫鄂皖邊區省蘇府於此、第一步没收官吏豪紳田産、與其他土地、以鄕爲單位、按照中農·貧農·雇農·之人口與勞動力、混合分配、幷召集全鄕羣衆大會、由工農中選舉土地委員、由十七人至二十一人組織土委會、鳴鑼集衆、同去跴田及山地、先將紅軍公田、提出分好、後將遠近田地山林池塘竹園等、作一總計算、好壞相配、混合劉分、幷將分田名單貼出、如某人認爲分得不好、可提出修改、又工農監委會、赤黨各級監委會及匪軍政治部、均受理土地分配不公立之訴訟、一般工人雇農貧農等、尤其匪軍家鵬、遂得大抬其頭、積極向富農地主進攻、時興殺戮之禍、亦云慘矣、</p>

<p>邇日來市府曁所屬各處局、正忙於遷移、約於本月杪一律可以遷入新市中心區新厦、中央社記者、特往市工務局舊址、晉謁該局局長沈怡、詢以今後對於發展大上海之意見、蒙接見談話如次、</p>
<p>首要步驟　沈氏以爲完成大上海之建設、應分若干步驟、我人處茲國難方殷、本市經濟又極艱窘之際、欲圖積極邁進、實非容易、且過去數年内、市政當局、對於大上海建設之計劃、曾苦心籌劃、當時確認發展市中心區、實爲推進大上海計劃之首要步驟、今經數年之努力、將市中心區之各幹道、次第完成、市府新厦曁各局臨時房屋、亦已落成、全體職員、不日即可遷入新屋辦公、</p>
<p>繁榮企圖　沈氏對於繁榮市中心區之企圖、着力於繁榮市中心區之諸原動力、市府曁所屬各處局之遷入、雖不若興建虬江碼頭·開闢商港·及遷移車站等事爲重要、但沈氏認爲市府遷移、亦爲繁榮市中心區原動力中之一種、至於興建碼頭等事、固爲原動力中之重要者、但舉辦此種事業、或非目前環境之所許、市府曁各局處遷入後、將注意於另一原動力、如圖書館·博物院·體育塲等、皆爲繁榮市面必要建設、沈氏感於目前市庫之支絀、各事建設、不能同時並進、當本視財力之所能及、所有一切市政建築、將儘先於市中心區進行、</p>
<p>市民合作　沈氏又申述市政當局、固必竭全力以興發市中心區、同時尤期待於全市市民、不論銀行界·或工商界·均能儘先在市中心區投資、或興辦實業、以收官民合作之效、市府曁所屬各處局、全體職員、已爲市民之先鋒隊、悉行遷入市中心區、以表示政府當局、對於繁榮市中心區確具决心、沈氏幷告以市中心區之建設、雖爲國人所共認爲當務之急、但外國與論界、每多以徒尙空論以責難、彼等所以唱如是論者、良以市中心區之與發、必將使租界受極大之打擊、故我市民更應竭誠恊助政府、以完成大上海之計劃、</p>
<p>整理舊區　沈氏對於舊市區之整理、仍主不可偏廢、整理舊車區、將本穩健主義、過去曾將小東門之東門街·老西門之和平路·開發後、該處市面頓見繁盛、嗣後對於開闢道路、一本此種審愼之態度、渠曾有整理舊市區之計劃、每多限於經費、幷受其他種種之牽制、故未能早日實現、舊市區之街道、多崎嶇不平、應迅謀修理、以便人行、尙有溝渠、久已失修、且無系統、亦將加以整理也、</p>

<p>勘定石婆婆口</p>
<p>已在積極進行</p>
<p>挽回航界權利</p>
<p>我國華南航輪勢力、昔以招商最大華北方面、以政記爲首、故有南招商北政記之稱、惟政記輪船、高級船員、多雇日人、又以北方無本國船塢、致每年各輪進廠修理、亦向日本船塢訂約、不僅利權外溢抑且妨碍航政、天津航政局、得悉政記與日方所訂船塢契約、在明年四月、即將期滿、烟台航局辦事主任徐達行、已與政記主人張政本、一再磋商、請其于滿約後、勿再續租、廢止合同、改入本國船廠、惟華北無完備船塢、着到上海、則又不便、於是恊商結果、即就烟台、創辦一巨大船塢、以供華北商輪之需求、從官督商辦入手、第一步先勘定地址購買土地、此事業已呈請交部核准、轉咨魯省府令烟台行政專員、恊同籌備進行、事關航權、亟爲查誌如下、</p>

<p>烟台航局辦事主任徐達行、鑒于芝罘龍口、爲北方輸運最發達之區而政記公司總經理處設在烟台、次如惠通·合興·福興·北方等各輪船行、亦營業頗巨、其他國内各處商輪航行烟台者更夥、總計自有船與經理正班輪、共有四五十艘、但船舶最需要之船塢至今猶未舉辦、各輪每遇大小修理、恒多駛往大連、旅　、或南往香港·九龍、甚或東渡日本、利權外溢殊爲可惜、故烟台添造船塢、實急不容緩、</p>

<p>目無船塢設備、于航政時施行機臺、如不及格、亦難立時修理、繼續航行、使航局職權、亦不得嚴格實施、再查烟台爲華北重要漁業區、按照總理實業計劃爲一漁業要港、現有漁輪數十艘、每年修理新造、亦多向日本或大連辦理、是船塢之設、直接挽回航權、間接繁興漁業也、</p>

<p>烟台適宜建築船塢之地、已經勘定芝罘島東南石婆婆口、該處沿岸高出海面一千餘尺、曾於民十三、被烟台官産清理處、以每畝二元之代價、招當地土人承領、惟聞欵未解啊、僅得官産處執照、未發部照、人民未得合法産據、近聞擬在該處建築船塢、竟爾居奇、高抬地價、至二百倍以上、購地尙有問題、</p>

<p>講演紀要　徐永祚會計師講詞、略紀如下、（一）改良必要、（甲）中式簿記之沿革、我國算學及會計制度、導源甚古、九章算術之所著、及歷代官廳會計之設官定制、史乘所載、歷歷可考、簿記法本與算學及會計、互相砥礪、互相助長、則其歷史之悠久、可以想見、禮記内則、書計並稱、計卽會計、簿記當然亦爲就傅時所應習者、降及宋代、有四柱清册之制、在簿記學上、尤有重大之貢獻、其法則之完密、可並美西洋之複式簿記法、中國之簿記法、實完成於四柱、距今蓋千餘年矣、而西法複式簿記法之完成、尙爲四五百年來之事、此爲世界簿記史上最可寳貴之一頁、惜吾國積習、士君子恥言貨利、簿記法素鮮請求、故千餘年來、進步甚少、師徒相傳、動失精義、地各爲制、業各爲法、以致組織紊亂、規律不明、自清季傳入西式簿記法、新式事業界競以此相尙、中式簿記、愈爲簿記學家所漠視、然其歷史旣深、應用又廣、究非西式簿記所能取而代之、故至今仍能保持其相當之地位、（乙）中</p>
<p>式簿記之長處、嘗考中式簿記、其重要長處、約有四端、（一）理論淺顯、中式簿記法、亦可名爲收付簿記法、收者欵項收入之謂、付者欵項付出之謂、財産增减變化之須豋帳者、均可依次爲記錄計算之標準、無須視西式簿記之必先探究借貸之原理、（二）方法簡便、在各種帳簿帳表帳單、收入帳目、均記入收項、付出帳目、均記入付項、記帳然、過帳然、結帳亦然、非若西式簿記之須决定交易借貸帳戶性質也、（三）通俗易曉、華文直式之收付簿記法、凡略知書算者、類能知之、稍加傳授、卽能記帳、非若西式簿記、必須長時間之學習也、（四）節省經費、紙張筆墨、全用國貨、價較洋貨爲廉、帳務人員、略經訓練、卽可從事、種種經費、均較用西式簿記者可省、（丙）中式簿記之缺點、長處誠如上所述、但缺點亦不在少、其主要者有四、（一）帳戶無一定之分類、往往性質不明、前後不同、目無統轄作用、（二）帳簿無一定之組織、往往顚倒紊亂、缺乏系統、（三）帳簿帳表帳單、無一定之格式、記載時無規範可循、（四）帳法無一定之規律、一任記帳者之自由、（丁）中式簿記改良之必要、中式簿記、爲中國歷史最久應用最廣之簿記、旣有固有之長處、自應就其缺點加以改良、使其成爲完善之簿記法、而在整理國粹提倡國貨之立塲上、亦有改良之必要、（二）改良必要、（甲）改良三前提、中式簿記法之改良、其前提有三、（一）科學方法簿記法爲一種科學、必須以科學方法整理之、方可使其合理化、（二）切合實用、簿記以實際應用爲前提、改良方案、自須力謀實用上之便利、（三）節省經費、會計事務、原非可以直接生利者、必須於可能節圍内、求其經費之節省乙·改良十大綱、依上述之三前提、可得改良之大綱十、（一）採用新式會計之原理原則、（二）維持上收下付之記帳程式、（三）維持現欵收付之記帳方法、（四）運用四柱結算法、（五）確定豋記數目所用之文字、（六）規定中式簿記之帳表格式、（七）確定豋帳戳記之使用方法、（八）規定有系統有秩序之帳戶分類、（九）規定有組織有系統的帳簿組織、（十）規定合理化紀律化的記帳規則、丙·改良三特色、改良方案、有特色三、（一）現欵式收付記帳法、卽凡收入欵項、記入日記簿之收項、過入騰清簿之收項、編入結算表之收項、付出欵項、記入日記簿之付項、過入騰清簿之付項、編入結算表之付類、惟現欵帳目之由日記簿過入騰清簿及結算表、均反其收付之方向、（二）簡便的統轄記帳法、可以不用統轄日記簿及總清簿或多行帳簿、而另有一種簡便的統轄記帳法、（三）売密的四柱給算法、其對於檢算錯誤之功用、與試算表無異、而對於報告會計之功用、則不獨可以表現收付之結果、並可表現收付之經過及比較、（三）改良經過、甲·第一時期、民國十年以前、余僅通西式籌記、對於中式簿記、不屑措意、嘗爲各公司規劃會計、輒抑中式而揚西式、乙·第二時期、民國十一二年間、旣執行會計師職務有年、漸感西式簿記之不爲一般社　所便、一方面對於中式簿記之接觸亦漸多、乃覺二者均有改良之必要、主張用中式帳簿、直式紀載、而採用西式之帳理、蓋西式爲體、中式爲用也、當時主張維持中式簿記之直式豋記、紙張須用國貨但對於帳理帳法、以爲應採納西式的精神、丙·第三時期、民國十五六年間、對於中式簿記之調查研究、漸有所得、承認其帳法並非全不合理、組織並非全無秩序、缺點乃在參差不一、故主張根據中國固有之帳法、參照西洋複式簿記之康理、以改良中式簿記、但因其無多行或統轄記帳之便利、而認爲不能通用大規模事業、丁·第四時期、近三四年來、對於改良中式簿記之設計日多、實施之成效漸著、同時並發現簡便的統轄記帳法、與完密的四柱結算法、推行於大規模事業、亦成效卓著、於是爲推行普及起見、擬編訂各業可以適用之標準方案、故自本年起、屛絕雜務、一志於此、茲已編成改良中式帳簿表單程式三十餘種、並另編一改良中式簿記槪說二書、交由標準帳表文件製售所印刷發行、</p>

<p>現行稅則有重至百分之念七者</p>
<p>造成外貨傾銷鐵工廠不能立足</p>
<p>市商會昨呈財政部云、呈爲呈請事、本月二十二日、接鐵業同業公會函稱、竊查銅鐵爲民間日常必需之用品、舉凡農工器具建築材料、莫不以此爲主要原料、</p>
<p>關係民生經濟　至爲重大、我國尙無鎔煉之康、平時所用、完全仰給於舶來、茲當建設之際、需用尤繁海關稅率、向以百分之十征稅爲原則、至於機器、則爲提倡工業起見、减爲百分之五、固法良而意美、乃自民國十二年來、各項鋼鐵原料之從量課稅者逐漸增加、而從價課稅者、仍依舊率、前年改定金單位之後、折合尤鉅、兹以本年五月間頒行之最新則例計算、與實在定貨價値比較、竟有徴至百分之三十左右者、關係國計民生、經濟建設、均極重大、今特舉其輕重不均、所關最要者、縷悉陳之、查則例第一八七條剪口鐵等雜碎片段、每担征收關金四角四分、約合洋八角四分、而其實在定價、每噸約僅英金四鎊左右、每担約合洋三元八角、以百分率計算、須百分之二十二、又第二百七條廢鐵及新貨中鑿下之段頌等、每担征收關金五角五分、約合洋一元零五分、而其定價每噸亦僅英金四鎊、每担約合洋三元八角、又第二百八條舊鐵碎鐵、祗合複製用者、每担征收關金四角一分、約合洋七角八分、而其定價、每噸約僅英金三磅、每担約合洋二元八角五分、均在百分之二十七以上、而第一七六條短熟條片等、以從價估計征稅者、定率仍爲百分之十、其間</p>
<p>相差幾近二倍　整鐵之稅、反輕於破碎之廢鐵、此極不公允者一也、查前三項之剪口鐵·廢鐵·碎鐵·等、皆係鋼鐵碎舊零星之材料、專爲各項鐵工廠及手工業之鐵匠店中、用以製造各種輕便機件鐵器、建築材料、農工用具、與民間一切日常用品之需、平時間之應用最多銷塲最廣、乃今課稅均在百分之二十以上、而第二一四條已成件之建築品等、則僅征稅百分之十五、是在外國製造器物運華銷售、其稅反輕、而未製成之原料且係破碎廢舊者、其稅反重、非但</p>
<p>造成外貨傾銷　之機會、而且使國内工業、永無發展競爭之望、卽各種建築材料機器用具等類、亦永遠不能仿製、惟有仰給於外來、蓋因原料稅率、已較成件者爲重、卽使製成之後、成本更重、豈能與外貨同銷、宜其工業之雖極提倡、而終無濟、此極不公允者二也、又查第一八三條、新鐵條等稅則、已減定爲每担關金五角、約合洋九角、而今定價每噸約須英金五鎊、每担約合洋四元八角、値約百分之十八、而第二百七條之廢舊及新貨中鑿下之段頭者、卽自此等新貨中所鑿下之不中繩墨、及外洋廠中剔除廢棄之料、在外國完全無用、運銷來華者、乃今收稅、反較原料之完整新貨爲重、矛盾顚倒、莫此爲甚、尋繹用意、或以新貨爲建築所需、故輕減其稅收、而奬勵其進口、不知中國工業、尙未發達、平時所需要者、實以破碎片段爲主、最價廉而合用、况凡改製建築物件、及仿造鐵器農工具等項、全恃此碎舊之段頭、而又爲中國所無者、乃反科以重稅、而减其完整新貨之則例、殊</p>
<p>不明用意所在　此極不公允者三也、再以稅則定率言之、同一鐵貨、應有同一之稅率、以普通言、新而完整者、應重於舊、而破碎者、以需要言、日用必需之原料、應輕於製造已成之器具、即以保護工商提倡建設言、亦應於國産所無、恃以供給一切者、課輕稅、以興製造、於國工可製、足以阻遏傾銷者、科重稅、以利民生、况從價課稅者、大都變遷鮮見之物、不妨稍重、而從量課稅者、必係日用習見之品、原應從輕、</p>
<p>今乃本末相反　使農工商業民生日用所恃製造之原料、竟倍重於完整成件之新貨、而同一鐵條完整而新者稅輕、鑿下之破碎廢棄者反重、此極不公允者四也、更以實在情理論之、鋼鐵稅率、原以百分之十爲極準、則凡一八七條二百七條二百八條三項、廢舊鐵料、旣爲民用工業所必需、徴稅原應比照第一八三條之新貨爲輕、以實在定價百分之十課稅、始與原則相符、至多亦應比照第二一四條之成件者相等、徴至百分之十五爲限、更决不能量於第一八三條之新貨十分之五、則萌芽之工業、或尙有一綫之生機、茲當提倡工業建設之際、舊鋼</p>

<p>百業發展前途　有密切之關係、巨大之影響、商人等生活於此、見聞自切、所知較深、不敢壅於上聞、亦絕非僅圖私利危　　　、蓋稅率之輕重、與物價之盈虛、兩相聯格、成本增重、售價亦自增高、故商人之受害雖顯、而損失猶淺、民間之受痛實大、而關切尤深、今聞明年一月、又有改訂稅則之訉、爲此選擇鐵貨中徴稅失平最關重要之數種、瀝叙實在情形、具文請求、俯予轉呈財政部、准將海關稅則第一八七條·第二百七條·第二百八條·剪口鐵廢鐵舊鐵等農工建築必需品之稅率、先行减訂、按照實在價値</p>
<p>百分之十征稅　以惠民生而蘇商困、等語到會、查現行進口稅則、鋼鐵一類、從價徴稅者凡十六條、其中値百抽五者、僅一八一條之鐵道岔道轉車台、此外値百抽十五者計七條、餘均爲値百抽十、是鋼鐵之進口稅、現行稅則、以値百抽十爲酌中數、其餘鋼鐵各品稅則中、多係從量徴稅、而論其物品性質、又多係日用尋常之件、是從量課稅之稅率、至多應不逾値百抽十之界限、乃據該公會所陳、竟有增至百分之二十二以至百分之二十七者、輕重旣屬失倫、施行殊多窒碍、理合備文呈請鈞部鑒核、俯賜比　値百抽十定章、逐一修正、以利民生、實爲公便、謹呈財政部、</p>

<p>該校校舍佔地三百畝、達築適宜、環境優良、編制分文理法商敎五學院、設十五學系、另附師範專修科、分設四系、經費歲入百二十八萬一千餘元、目前收支尙能相低、惟歷年欠債頗多、該校財力有限、院系過多、難以發展、商學院辦理未見成效、師範專科、分設四系、亦有未妥、全校職員七十六人、敎員七十六人、内兼任敎員太多、學生一千四百二十五人、敎室與中學合用、甚感不敷應用、敎員學生合作精神頗佳、敎育學院辦理較善、師生共同研究、精神尤佳、訓育管理、尙見認眞、惟學生風尙多趨奢侈、女生更見浮華、中西圖書、未見充實、理化儀器藥品缺乏特甚運動衛生設備、尙能足用、</p>
<p>綜合言之、此次視察六校、文理商三學院、各校均備、設有法學院者、爲大夏復旦、設有敎育學院者、滬江大夏、餘雖未設該項學院、大都設有該項學系、或與該項學院相類似之學系、以上海一隅、大學院系重疊如此、欲求整個發展、無論在經濟方面或人才方面、均爲不可能、與其編制龐大、徒事舖張、而一無所發展、不若分别裁併、縮小範圍、以求特殊之發展、因此上海各大學之院系問題、實有由政府或由各校自動聯合加以系統的整理之必要、</p>
<p>據現查結果、辦學精神極爲貫注者、爲大同滬江二校、理學院辦理較有成績者、亦爲滬江大同二校、敎育學院以大夏辦理較善、商學院以復旦辦理較善、餘如光華邇來之整頓、曁南戰後之整理、各有相當之努力、惟光華行政組織、不甚健全、精神頗形渙散耳、</p>
<p>各校經常收入、除曁南外、每年最多不過二十餘萬元、最少乃有僅十餘萬元者、以大學課程之專設備之廣、需費浩繁、交出方面、不得不以極經濟之方法行之、往往公立學校之濫用職員、浪費公欵之流弊、在私立學校較爲罕見、各私校除滬江外、經費均極感困難、而學校當局精神並無少懈、甚至尙朝夕籌謀、以求校務之發展、其致力事業之精神與苦心、殊可佩也、</p>
<p>各校除滬江外、歷年均有虧欠、自數萬元以至二三十萬元不等、此皆由于經費不充所致、因經費之不充足往往多招收學生而取費且昂、少聘請專任敎員而報酬且低、查各該校對於虧欠、雖年籌還、終屬無濟于事、長此以往、勢將難以維持、甚望中央每年能撥給經費若干、擇其成績優良者、提定用途、酌予補助、以示奬勵、且各該私立大學多數缺乏基金、卽或有之、爲數亦極微、並望各該校自行速謀補救、</p>
<p>各校敎員、滬江全數　專任、其餘均以兼任敎員多佔數、復旦兼任敎員、覺達百分之八十、查各該校敎員名册中、有兼課數校者、有兼任兩校系主任者、甚至有在他埠兼任職務者精神旣不能專注、敎學自無效率可言、卽單就講演以貫輸智識猶嫌不足、遑論訓練人才與研究學問乎、苟不加以改進、影響學生學業、實非淺鮮、</p>
<p>招生問題、各校大都不甚嚴格、本年各校投考與錄取之百分比、滬江略低、餘均甚高、甚至初中畢業後、假造一紙證書、卽可考入大學、苟招生時、能嚴格審查資格、及認眞舉行入學考試、則此等學生自無從朦混矣、</p>
<p>各校圖書及科學實騐設備、大都均感缺乏、圖書多爲舊籍或零亂略無統系、逐年新增有限、實騐設備、大同滬江差可敷用、亦能充分利用、但亦未見完備、曁南因受滬戰影響、尙在添購、其餘各校、僅有基本科目之簡單設備、甚至必需實騐之重要學程、而缺乏實騐設備、致學生毫無實際經騐、</p>
<p>各校畢業論文除滬江外、均嫌題目範圍太麽、甚有抄襲書本、敷衍塞責、學生實際上並未得到若何惠益、此後各校論文、宜注重實際研究、並作專門問題之探討、俾可獲得實際經騐與自動研究之方法、</p>
<p>各校學生服飾、大同比較樸素、其餘大多數習于奢侈繁華、衣履則競尙新奇、體態則趨于柔靡、甚至出入娛樂場所、感受時下習氣極深、此項事實、報章歷有豋載、至女生服飾、尤多繁華新奇、苟不加以矮正、質樸剛强之風氣、决無由養成而家庭與社會將俱受其害也、</p>
<p>關於學生智識方面、曾於視察時、擇一二校召集學生自治會代表談話、詢以學生在國難期間、應作何準備工作、續又詢其對於國家高籌敎育政策之意見、並自治會領導同學之具體方案、學生竟均無辭以對、良久始表示其意見、但多空浮錯謬、不切實際、各該校對于明恥敎戰及復興民族之敎育工作、允於特别注意、加倍努力、應不負大學敎育之本旨也、</p>

<p>義務敎育最普及</p>
<p>師範生特别優待</p>
<p>升大中學有奬金</p>
<p>丨敎部顧督學視察後談話丨</p>
<p>敎育部督學顧兆鏖、視察山西等省敎育回部後、據談山西義務敎育普及辦法、費省效宏、各省市頗可依法仿行、並談各級敎育有幾種特殊之　、茲分述於下、</p>
<p>▲義務敎育　山西小學之義務敎育、　最發達最普及的省份、該省冀敎育廳長於二十一年到任時省垣失學兒童有五千人、現在失學者僅有一千餘人、不但太原市如此、卽鄕村小學如代縣、現在失學兒童僅一百餘人、此一百餘人、及太原之千餘人、皆是因學生家屬太窮要另外想法救濟、大槪普通人家、都可就學、其原因（一）小學不收學費、（二）不收宿費、（三）膳費甚廉、每月僅須一元數角、一個學生受完全之小學敎育、每年連膳宿書籍用品、統共僅須納費二十元之譜、而該省村治辦理甚好、由上至下有系統、對於普及義敎亦多助力、而冀敎廳長設實騐小學五處、實校分三種制度、（一）普通班、（二）短期班、（三）簡易班、因此調劑、亦爲易於推行義敎之帮助、蓋一般社會、對於短期與簡易班、都有所懷疑、一校旣有三種制度、則學生資質差者、入短期或簡易班、優秀者、可提升普通班、因材施敎可解除社會之懷疑、而滿其願望、此種辦法、各省大可仿行、</p>
<p>▲中等敎育　（一）該省原有六　個師範區、最奇者、師範學校除省垣以外、省外各校班級不銜接、女師尤甚、敎廳計劃、擬將前期三年之師範、倂入中學去辦前期普中、將后三年之後師單獨設立師校、（二）中學經費、除太原市比較充裕外、省外中學經費、都無一定之標準、而女學尤甚、敎廳正在擬訂經費標準草案、尙未確定、大約明年、關於中學經費、可定有標準照行、（三）女學無高中、除少數私立高中間收女生外、省内外無女高中之設立、故女子升學之機會較少、本年敎廳將私立光華女中收歸省辦、改名省立太原女子初級中學、將來計劃、擬增設高中、使女子敎育、得以深造、（四）該省最特殊現象、卽女子敎育不發達、全省有女中一校、女師五校、學生人數皆不多、女師班級、學生最少者、有每級僅六人至八人、該省社會心理、蓋不願使女子多進學校、照此情形、將來該省大有將女師减少、在男師内添設女師班、以爲節省經費之趨勢</p>
<p>▲高等敎育　（一）該省山西大學、在光緒年間卽設立、歷史最久、與北洋大學相彷彿、内設文法工三學院、經費年支二十七萬二千三百十四元、現照八折支費、該校在前北京敎育部時代、是爲國立、國民政府成立后、敎部令改省立、但一般敎職員及學生、至今仍謀恢復國立運動、其所持理由、以該處中央與地方稅未劃清、經費一部份由省給、亦有一部由國庫支給、現有男女學生七百人、附屬高中學生亦數百人、前次敎部以該省科系重複、令將私立法敎兩學院歸併、至今未併者、固由於經費標準不同、省方不易籌增經費、（歸併后要四十二萬元）、而山大員生、爲謀恢復國立運動、若將私立法敎兩院併入、進行國立、反較不便、故對於歸併不熱心、亦一原因也、該校從前設立時、用費甚鉅、故校址設備、楚楚可觀、惟常年費每月僅兩萬餘元、又須八折、旣包含三院、故最近設備未大增加、工學院有機器電學、土木工各系、王校長係專門學者、故工學院歷届畢業生、在本省服務、頗有相當成績、（如修建省路等、都係工院畢業生設計進行、）文法兩院、圖書設備、舊存典籍、足敷應用、惟應用之參考書尙須擴充、（二）工業專科學校、在民國二十年間錫山退職時、將工業實騐所、及模範工場、併入該校、故機器之設置較好、製磁·窰冶·能製成高温度的燒瓶、成績還好、又有機器製革、出品優良、惜運銷方法欠缺、尙未能推售盡利、（三）商業專科與農業專科學校、辦理大致不差、惟設備方面、稍形缺乏、（四）私立幷州學院内有文法兩科、學生四百餘人、本年成立化學系、初能照中央趨重理科辦法辦理、雖在前北京敎育部時代立案、然在現代、尙未經過立案手續、（五）私立川至醫科專校、設備尙好、靳校長亦能努力、附設助産一科、甚有成績、其畢業生、服務軍醫者多、自行業醫者少、</p>
<p>職業敎育　該省職業敎育、因以前所辦甲乙兩種職業工商學校不得法、畢業后無出路、社會對職敎多所懷疑、而敎育行政所訂計劃、對於職敎、亦未顧到、未能成立、現經與部督學商討情形、及决定最重要原則如下、（一）提倡職敎、在不加敎費情形之下、至民國廿六年度職敎經費、占中等敎育百分之三十五經費標準、（二）照閻錫山所訂十年建設計劃内、有地方特種生産、（如牧畜、鹽務等、）但以新式工業、製造生産品、無論手工、機器、都感不足、以致辦理少成效、勢須設法改良、而養成學生技術與勤勞習慣、亦頗重要、該省敎界、經商討之后、對於職敎、已引起勇氣、敢於嘗試、可按照山西生産狀况、將來新興工業、以太原爲中心、因原有兵工廠造紙廠各基礎、都集中於太原、若在此設工科職校、不患學生無出路、實可分佈全省、與所謂特種生産、可雙軌相輔而行、特種生産、則以地方爲中心、（三）以后職校設科與辦法、及師資問題、大致已有討論、尙未决定、依山西缺乏下級技術人才情形、將來趨向、職業補習學校、有廣設之必要、其次則爲初級職校、於高級職校、不必多設、但職業校之師資、非常重要、如能悉心養成技術師資、似較多多養成探討學理之師範生爲優、</p>
<p>▲奬學辦法　該省入師範學校者、無論係前期普科、后期師科、每月均有膳費五元之津貼、學生實際吃飯二元幾角、每月所餘二元幾、大可添置學業用品、此師範之優待、其普通人中學及大學者、有奬學金、各縣都有一筆經費、預備爲本縣學生升學生升學之用、縣份好的、（卽升學人數少可以多　派）每人年可得七八十元之津貼、縣份差些、每人亦可分三四十元、此就升本省中學而言、倘到省外升入專科以上學校、同時一面得本縣津貼七八十元、一面得本省補助一百多元、故到外省升學者、自己所貼私費甚少、此種奬學金辦法、可謂獨優、但該省因高等敎育方面科系重複、升學於北平各校者、多入文法等科、入理工科者十不一見、因其平時敎學使然、此爲山西敎育整個問題、經此次部督學視察之后、敎廳方面、對全省敎育、亦知有所偏、將有新計劃、加以整理云、</p>

<p>丨三十九比三十六丨</p>
<p>良華三大將皆被罰出</p>
<p>復旦超出後仍然失敗</p>
<p>普成大敗於滬江</p>
<p>天津良華及高麗普成兩籃球隊、昨晚第二次在中華籃球房出場、一則勝利、一則受挫、良華雖以三十九比三十六勝復旦大學、在最後之四分鐘、良華曾以三十三比三十六爲復旦所壓倒、經過極度之驚險、良華才以三十七比三十六超出、最後以三十九比三十六得勝、普成滬江之戰、則爲一面倒形勢、普成以三十四比五十六大敗、</p>
<p>良華勝來不易</p>
<h3 id="c217">良華佔居上風 <a href="#c217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>開賽後、雙方奔波不定者有時、唐寳堃才首先得中、趙不忝罰尹鴻祥、復旦亦得一分、良華小唐與劉振元、陸續而中、成八比一、於是良華卽佔據上風、不爲復旦所追獲、相差每在十分左右、復旦雖有機會、亦擲而不中、心與願違、上半時完畢成二十四比十七、</p>
<h3 id="c218">風波由是開始 <a href="#c218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>良華雖超出七分、但形勢則甚見惡劣、劉振元及後衛兩人、皆已掛上犯規紀錄三次、隨時可以罰出、果然、下半時於二十七比二十時、良華前鋒之一員主將、劉振元四次犯規罰出、從此良華危機頓見、全綫陷於混亂、得分旣難、對方之進攻益烈、幸小唐主持全軍、尙堪維持、</p>

<p>局面大變、復旦節節進逼、愈追愈近、三十三比三十二、只差一分矣、而在此一髮千鈞之際、良華後衛主將、張景寳又以四次犯規罰出、趙不忝兩罰兩中、遂以三十四比三十三追出、功臣趙不忝在此時期、一連得中八分之多、良華經此大變、全部陷於慌亂、不知所措、時間旣極短促、良華欲起、似乎甚難、</p>

<h3 id="c229">脚癬問題 <a href="#c229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— 龐京周</p>
<p>脚癬乃中國南方人的通病。就是足趾之間的奇癢，白腐，脫皮，小泡，流黄水，奇臭，有時甚至蔓延到脚背脚底，以致潰爛到不良於行的一種病。因爲出水後較舒服。俗稱又呌他做濕氣。因爲小泡初脫皮時。有一細孔在眞皮部份。所以又稱做脚蛀。</p>
<p>照舊醫理講。說道濕氣的出路。生了這個東西。不生大病。照患者自己講。說道這是人生一種大樂趣。因爲在此病不輕不重的程度之下。每天晚上拿熱水燙湯狠是舒服。或是呌三五天修脚匠用鐵片刮刮，刮至血出癢止。也覺得渾身通泰。</p>
<p>但是在我們看來。即使濕氣二字是某種疾病的代名詞。那麽濕氣的出路。自有生成的汗孔大便小便那些排洩機關。一定要在好好的皮膚上。另外闢一條血水淋漓的路以便濕氣的流利。恐怕不是天地搆造生人的本意罷。再說北方。患脚癬的人。難道就毋須出濕氣。而南方人如此犧牲了皮肉。出了許多濕氣。偏偏還要犯北方人所不犯的什麽濕溫病。這筆賬，又如何算法呢？實在醫家没有識貨脚癬是怎麽一回事。也不知道怎樣可以使脚上所出的濕氣。把他領導到正規的大小二便或汗孔中去排洩。於是歷來揑成一種似是而非的學說。深醉了人民的腦筋。而人們起先遂將病拖在身上以爲有益。可謂認賊作父。到後來爲止癢而求熱水。求鐵片。不知不覺養成了習慣。遂變爲嗜痂有癖當年不成才的狂士金聖歎。曾說「留一二瘡瘢在私處背人搔之大樂」。想不到三百年來。他的信徒一個也没有减少。其實諸君想想。背人搔私處瘡瘢。與乞丐向陽捫蝨有無兩樣景象。文明人何必在這種狀况之下找樂趣呢？</p>
<p>查脚癬之爲病。乃是一種寄生物的皮膚病。那種寄生物是一種線菌類。平常空氣中間常有。倘然附着到人的皮膚上。而他的環境適宜。他就發育滋長而致人疾病。（例如多脚汗的人。足趾間容易生。那就是菌的環境適宜。）有是從足趾間傳染到手上。也可以發同樣的病象。這種菌。並非中國專有。不過中國南部以及較熱的地方爲多。如南洋各地以及香港。也就極盛。以前外人在香港發見此症。因此就呌這種病爲「香港脚」。到了寒帶地方。以及另外各地就可不生此病。那明明是天時地理。都與這菌類不相宜之故。而菌類死滅，其病自愈罷了。所以簡單說一句。脚癬中是「熱帶傳染性皮膚病」的一種而已。</p>
<p>我本人也就生過此病。早經治愈。此後也曾復發。又治好了。（其實不是復發。乃是再度傳染來的。因爲空氣中常有的東西。舊鞋子頭内往往也有。如果忽然換穿久未穿過的鞋子。而剛剛多出脚汗。就又釀成了。只要治好之後。勤於洗脚。包管不易再生。）我覺得在此病消滅之後我也並不生什麽其他的病症。眞是了無他異。此外替人治好的也不知多少。因爲我按着病原所配合的一種複方藥膏。自問十分靈騐。那些治愈的。也報告我說「了無他異」其中偶有數人。老老實實說「爲了足趾間忽然不癢。精神上反而有些短期的不習慣而已。要說另生大病。也未見得。」</p>
<p>但是倡濕氣出路之說的人。有一個最有力的證據。說「凡是患脚癬的人。等到脚癬忽然不出水時。往往發熱或病了。或則大病臥床。脚癬反而好了。一這都是的眞的事實。然而這一個因果倒置的論調。要知道人之將病。脚癬才不出水。那是因爲皮膚中抵抗線菌作用改變的緣故。人之已病。更不出水。也是同一道理。至於久病臥床。自然平臥赤足。旣没有鞋襪的束縛。又没有粘滯的脚汗。而足趾通氣乾燥。最不利於此種線菌的繁殖。自然病象驟去了。只看鄕下人常常赤足在田間工作。所受濕氣不少。何以反而不生脚癬。再看夏天穿凉鞋的朋友。脚癬也能自愈。那麽濕氣之脫。豈非不攻自破麽？社會上不乏膽大的人士。還請治治脚癬試試看。治好了到底生什麽大病。那麽醫的眞理就明白了。</p>
<h3 id="c230">談「日與夜」關於人體生理作用之能力 <a href="#c230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— 朱仰高</p>
<p>以前的醫生對於此層不多研究。因科學方面對於天時之詳情。少有發明。近年來則因氣候學之長足進步。故能使醫學對於此問題之連帶關係。漸漸明瞭。其實在普通民間之經騐。實已能證明若干事實。如天氣之與性情。天氣之與一般病症等是。惟不能用科學方法解釋之而已。此種事實不但在吾國民衆方面極多。即世界各民族中亦有之。</p>
<p>在大自然界中。除了人類之外。吾人久知其關係。如有若干植物花朶必在夜間開放。（夜來香）。其他則於夜間閉縮。法人大植物學家Ｌmno氏稱此現象爲花之睡覺。且說吾人可利用此現象觀察時間。成爲一種「花鐘」。其準確由此可見矣。吾國民間亦知有此種現象。如在梅花開時。知春大開始。凡此種種。多是證明植物生活作用之與天時之關係。其動作實隨之而變化。德人稱ＫosmischeＢceuiＩussg　auf　desＬebeu。在動物界中吾人知有許多動物的生理作用與月亮之循環時其有不離的關係。在地中海底上。有一種生毛刺的虫類。他的性交時候。恒在月亮變化之一定時期。且與此期從不差誤。（在何期因一時記者不克查出）。總之在動植界中都能指出其種密切關係。其在人類。亦當有同樣之現象。本不足奇。</p>
<p>人類生理作用。本來亦有此類現象。如日則欲醒。夜則欲睡。醒則動作。睡則休息。原來亦是一種循環。依Ｅores的意見。人類之所以在日間醒與夜間睡者。因爲人類的視覺器管爲主要的器管。故在受日光刺激的時候須醒。在黑夜的時候須睡。鳥類之亦以目爲主要器管者。亦與人類同睡同醒。如狗類則與人類不同。因他的主要器管是嗅器管之故。此種事實。人都可見。吾人雖有電燈及其他光明之工業發明品。但在夜間作工。恒不如日間之快樂。且終覺晚間較爲疲倦。有人在夜工者。曾作試騐。令其日間隨意的醒睡。但結果雖經久時之試騐。亦不能得在夜間工作之快樂輕爽。故睡覺與醒。其原由則在日夜之分别。而不全在日間作工過勞。而需夜間之休息亦明。</p>
<p>除了這醒睡循環之外。尙有其他的生理工作循環。如血壓之降落。呼吸中樞之刺激。性之低下。心臟工作速度之減少等等。血液中酸度因呼吸之　形而增加其量。尿中燐化合物之排泄亦隨之加量。都是與夜睡有密切之關係。此外即是熱度之變遷亦呈循環式樣。舊說則往往認爲黄昏時熱度之漲升。是受日間工作之單獨應響。但此種理想。已無立足之可能。以長時間（八年）夜間工作者之試騐。即能解釋其不然其熱度之升降。完全是一種自然之反應。而呈循環式。其不能以其他作用全然消滅之明矣。與此熱度同呈生理循環者。尙如尿量之排泄。（夜間十二時爲其最低量。日間午前爲其　高量。）肝膽工作Ｇlycogeu之發泄等是。</p>
<p>上述的種種生理作用之外。當然尙有其他尙未詳悉的同例。照人身生理作用。都是Ｒeaksfoneu　u·Ｇegenreaksicnen（反應與反反應）之大團結之理想。那麽吾人身生理工作　或無一不與日夜有密切之關係。致於操縱各種循環之之總樞。當然是腦部。尤以ＨypophysenＬwischenhirnsyssem（中腦系統）。爲最適當。因有若干臨床上之證據。足爲此說之助。雖然。在人體中亦有一定的部位。足爲操縱此類循環之中樞。惟吾人尙須想到這作用之發現。究竟是在内部呢。抑是受了外界之刺激。這個問題。是可用後者之說說明之。吾人可用動物試騐證明其原由。全是「日光」與「黑暗」之作用。這二種情形。就是此循環式樣的原動力。其實吾人這要想到地球各處之日夜。根本上不是同時同刻。而各處人到了他的夜間。都呈他的倦的現象。這豈不是一個很顯明的證據麽。</p>
<h3 id="c231">疾病常識問答 <a href="#c231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— 程瀚章</p>
<p>（二十二）胸膜炎</p>
<p>（問）　胸膜炎是那一部分的病？</p>
<p>（答）　胸膜炎是呼吸器病中最占多數的病；就是肺外面和胸腔内面所被覆的胸膜，發生炎症的疾病。</p>
<p>（問）　胸膜炎的原因有幾種？</p>
<p>（答）　原因很多：有原發性的，像感冒外傷等。有續發性的，大多續發於結核，肺炎，關節風濕痺，腹膜炎，心包炎，和各種傳染病等。</p>
<p>（問）　一般的病狀怎麽樣？</p>
<p>（答）　大多以輕度的惡寒發熱開始。患側的胸部起疼痛，這種疼痛，是從罹患的部分向胸側或脊側或腹腔放散。咳嗽頻發，但並没有咯痰。病人的脈搏數增加，面色蒼白，身體倦怠，食慾減退。</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>（問）　胸膜炎的病猒，有幾種區别？</p>
<p>（答）　有乾性，羅性，和化膿性的區别。</p>
<p>（問）　乾性胸膜炎怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）　乾性胸膜炎的患側胸部，呼吸運　　　，打診時有　音，聽診時有摩擦音；病人喜向健側的一面緒臥。若發炎部分在近　膈面，那末打診時没有摩擦音；可是季肋部有疼痛，嚥下時更劇烈。</p>
<p>（問）　濕性胸膜炎怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）　是有多量的滲出液，所以患部膨大，呼吸左右側不問。心尖搏動被壓迫而移向健側；肝和脾的位置，也受影響。病人往往向患側橫臥。打診時，在患部呈濁音。而濁音界的上方却有輕度的鼓音。滲出液減少的時候，聽診時，在濁音境界上緣有摩察音。發熱跟着滲出液的多寡而消長。小便的分量也減少。等到滲出液被吸收之後，就能增多小便的。</p>
<p>（問）　化膿性胸膜炎怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）　若使化膿菌侵入而起胸膜炎時，滲出液變成膿性，這就是化膿性胸膜炎。病人多發生高熱，伴以弛張性的惡寒，有倦怠，頭痛，脈搏頻數等症狀。胸部疼痛劇甚：因爲胸膜愈着的事情較少所以多能聽到支氣管音。</p>
<p>（問）　胸膜炎的　後，危險程度怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）　乾性胸膜炎，大多數是没有危險的；但往往要繼發肺結核。濕性的，關係於滲出液的量和病人的年齡；大都是結核性的　多，所以不能完全治愈。滲出液大量，就有生命的危險。</p>
<p>（問）　若使滲出液不吸收，身體有什麽危險？</p>
<p>（答）　滲出液若長時停留，要形成硬結，起胸膜的瘉着，後起萎縮。萎縮的範圍廣大時，胸壁變成扁平，脊柱向患側彎屈。</p>
<p>（問）　滲出性胸膜炎後，發生什麽疾病？</p>
<p>（答）　發生慢性支氣管炎，支氣管擴張症又有胸廓的率引痛。</p>
<p>（問）　胸膜炎的治療方法怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）　完全臥床；最要緊是注意心力，給與强心藥。若咳嗽劇烈，可投以麻醉劑，像古待因之類。對於發熱，用退熱藥。疼痛時，局部用器布或泥膏塗敷。内服藥對於風濕痺性的胸膜炎，可用柳酸劑，或慢性的用碘劑。爲排出滲出液起見，用利尿劑，或行穿刺術吸收瀦留的液體。但出血性的胸膜炎，禁忌穿刺。胸腔内有化膿的時候，須行胸廓切開術。</p>
<h3 id="c232">如何增進吾人之健康與長壽 <a href="#c232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— 郭人驥</p>
<p>吾人苟能講求衛生鍜鍊體格於平時。可以達到强壯與健康。而健康之結果。必獲長壽。</p>
<p>聞者疑吾言乎？凡體格已受鍜鍊者之身體機能。必較諸一般人爲强盛。是以其抵抗疾病之力强。而其恢復之力亦强。外病之侵襲若非其勢甚强。不致罹病。即雖罹病而死亡者鮮。必能早奏痊愈者也。</p>
<p>假令同屬負傷之人。若爲比賽選手。必迅速治愈。不貽痕跡。若爲老人。或虛弱者。即不易發生肉芽。治愈遲緩。甚者易起化膿。創口不易愈合。尤以結核者之創口難以愈合。治愈後之瘢痕。亦顯示其醜惡之外觀。</p>
<p>且負傷而不呈症狀者亦恒有之。疾病亦然。昔倍登考夫氏曾吞食虎疫菌之純粹培養。施行其著名之自家實騐。因其消化機能强健之故。腸管内雖有濃厚之虎疫病原。亦可證明其不發起虎疫症（重症霍亂）也。</p>
<p>嘗有同家族中有腸傷寒類傷寒流行性感冒等急性傳染病侵入而起傳染之時。其中獨有一人不被傳染者。殊不罕見。而斯人父爲充分健康。且甚富於活動性者。是誠屢所經騐者也。</p>
<p>以上所陳。皆身體之能制勝疾病者也。不幸而有極强盛之病原侵入。無論如何强健之人。不得抵抗病魔。而致夭折者亦有見之。是故吾人欲期望夫長壽。須講求衛生。鍜鍊體格於平時。以增進身體之一切機能。成爲强健而擴大吾人生活之幅員爲必要。</p>
<p>歷觀東西各文明國家所報告之死亡與原因比例的統計。吾人類除傳染病及消化器病外。占死亡中之最多數者。厥爲呼吸器系及循環器系之疾病。達全死亡者約四分之一。然此等器官系大抵得依衛生與運動可以强大其機能。是以平時注重體育而此等機能已成强健者。對於此等疾病。已非甚爲可怖者矣。</p>
<p>唯胃腸病占死亡者百分之一五以上。曩昔嘗有主張運動家短命說者。固當大加注意。然此運動家短命說之根據。大字目擊夫國術式運動家之狀態而立論者耳。彼過渡時代之運動家。其運動之方法。尙未進入正軌。而又不知衛生之方法。偶而其中之數人有相繼夭折之事發生。遂爲危詞以聳觀聽。仰知彼等方在少年時代之際。率皆濫飲狂食。運動則無規則。或過激烈。當其比賽之時。憑藉天賦之體力。以爲可以久恃。在此身體運動旺盛之期間。無論若何大量之食物。洵能容易消化。濫飲酒類。亦尙不呈病症。然其後逐漸脫離運動界之時。尙不知改革當年之惡習慣。依然暴飲暴食。而運動則已停止。遂致爲病魔所侵襲而致夭折矣。是恒數見不鮮者也。</p>
<p>然今日科學化之運動家。决無此事發生。蓋彼食不過飽。嚴守其極有規則之生活。深悉夫不守衛生怠於練習。終不能獲得良好之結果也。常競競焉勵行强壯之法。以保持其健康。是故東西洋之體育家。從未見有罹斯種災害者也。</p>
<p>吾人施行强壯法。繼續保恃其强壯與健康。終至達到自然的死亡。即所謂終其天年而死亡者。斯得謂之長壽。不自然的死亡。即稱夭折。尤以不自然死亡之中。或爲自殺。或爲中毒。或由外傷。突然侵襲身體者有之。凡大多數之疾病。要在吾人之健康度減低之時。或爲不健康狀態之時。始能侵入於體内。完全健康狀態之人。若不先行障害其健康。必不罹病。一若其與疾病之中間。有一種之障壁或塹壕。作爲防禦物然也。</p>
<p>不自然死之原因有種種。其自内部發起者。</p>
<p>遺傳。精神的變調。機能的變調。其他不明之原因。</p>
<p>自外部發起者。</p>
<p>溫度。濕度。中毒。外傷。黴菌。寄生蟲。</p>
<p>其他尙有不明瞭者。</p>
<p>此等原因。或僅一種。或數種。内外相應。或僅由一方面而致死亡。自其可以致死之原因發現以至死亡之時間。吾人謂之曰Ｎeclobiose「間接之組織之死。」其久暫不一。若爲外傷。有不出數秒間者。若爲慢性染。有恒數十年之久者。</p>
<p>當是時也。吾人體内爲防禦其疾病或驅逐其病毒起見。旺盛種種之機能。淋巴與白血球活潑環游。血清旋流。肝臟逞其動作。内分泌高其作用。故其結果。能表顯發赤腫脹化膿發熱發汗分泌等現象。</p>
<p>若幸而此等抵抗防禦之作用奏效。則Ｎeclobio終止。仍得回復其向來健康之途。而此防禦抵抗之作用。尤强於一般强壯健康之人也。</p>
<p>吾人之身體外表。有皮膚或粘膜完全被覆之。若爲完全健康之人。體表毫無裂隙。病原烏得而侵入之。一若是等外敵。悉被擊退於國境之外。然實際身體表面欲其毫無裂隙。殊爲困難。是以外敵容易侵入國内。擾亂安寗。顧病原多乏自己運動之力。苟不憑藉他力。竟有不能運動者。吾人若不自行開門揖盜。决不能被其侵入者也。善養生者。盍亦再三注意於斯乎。</p>

<h3 id="c234">改良中式簿記之四時期 <a href="#c234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— 徐永祚</p>
<p>作者（徐君自稱）於會計簿記之學，雖習自學校；但專意研究，尙在民國七八年以後。時値主編「銀行週報，」爲求同好便於切磋起見，就該報開一「會計研究」專欄，略據所見。此時所研究者，全以西洋複式簿記爲對象，不覺信之堅而提倡焉力。並認中國帳簿顚倒紊亂，支離破碎，毫無研究之價値，主張完全廢棄，改用西洋橫式豋記之簿記。開或爲各公司規劃會計制度，亦本此主張以從事，如交易所帳簿卽其例也。此爲作者對於中國簿記改良之第一時期。所主張提倡者，純屬西洋複式簿記，所實施改良者，均屬大規模之新式企業；至對於中式簿記，可謂無正確認識，與今之一般專主張西式簿記者無以異也。</p>
<p>民國十二一年間，作者執行會計師業務有年，並鑒於西式簿記不能爲一般人所認識，完全倣行，究有未便；再則因改用西式簿記，致一切用品，亦皆仰給於舶來，價値昂貴，採辦匪易，亦非提倡改良之善策；三則爲要某案提出查帳報告於法院，法官竟以不慣閱亞拉伯數字爲理由，要求另造；由是知採用西式簿記，有窒礙難行之處，但猶不能忘情於西式簿記，不過就形式方面，稍事改易，如橫寫之改爲直行，記載全用中文，金額亦以中文列記，但省去每個數字間之位名，如十百千萬等，而以線或點區分其位數。帳簿用國紙，記帳用毛筆，先後爲某商會及某某二大學規劃會計組織，卽本此主張以從事，用者亦尙稱便。當爲某商會規劃會計組織時，本擬有橫式直式二種，結果亦以直式之便利而採用之。但其帳理帳法，全倣西式，非一般人所能習。數字正寫於格内，不便疾書，帳簿規定格式，須特别印刷，添置不易，凡此種種，均多窒礙，故未能推行於商工各業。此爲作者對於中國簿記改良之第二時期。迄今官廳簿記，尙多用此方式以改良者。但作者此時所主張維持者，僅中式簿記之形式，至其内容，仍不免偏信西式簿記也。</p>
<p>民國十四五年，作者旣鑒於吾國推行西字簿記式不易，而維持中式簿記形式之改良方案，又多窒礙，復因執行業務關係，與商工界之接觸日多，同時並努力於中式簿記之調查研究，略有所得，對於中式簿記之觀念，爲之一變。認爲中式簿記，並非全無組織，記帳方法，並非全不合理，病在參差不一耳。不僅在形式上，有維持之必要，卽在本質上，亦有其保存之價値。且以其行使之廣，歷史之久，愈覺甚礎鞏固，决非西式簿記所能取而代之。但同時又發見其缺點甚多，非加改良不可。當時爲各公司規劃會計組織，卽本此主張以從事；爲之規定帳戶分類，帳簿組織，會計規則等，使其會計事務之處理，有一定之準繩，而對於中國歷來所通行之純粹現金式記帳法（卽流水過入謄清並不反其收付，）照舊沿用，金額之用全寫之或數碼字記載，均一任記帳員之自由，帳簿亦不特别印定格式，以期易行。此爲作者對於中國簿記改良之第三時期，推行迄今，成績尙佳。但當時常引爲缺憾者，則金額占地位較多，帳簿直式，不能採用多欄式記帳法，西式簿記中最可稱道之統轄記帳法，竟亦無由倣行。故認爲改良中式簿記，祇收付帳目較少者適用之，未足語諸大規模事業也。民國十五六年，在上海總商會演講，曾引此爲缺憾；今之談改良中式簿記者，蓋仍多此感也。</p>
<p>近數年來，作者受託爲事業界改良中式簿記之設計者日多，成效漸著。而對於中式簿記之認識與改良方法之發現續有進步。其最足快心者則有三事。</p>
<p>（一）西洋簿記法之能應事業規模之大小與帳目收付之繁簡，以變化其帳簿組織者，全賴利用多欄記帳法與帳簿分割法，以達到其分化與集合之能事，增進會計上辦事之效能。中式帳簿，中文直寫，其直幅不宜過長，雖無敷設多欄金額之便利，但能利用帳簿分割法，以變化其帳簿之組織。如銀錢日記，若以收付目的物爲標凖，可分立現欵日記·行莊日記·來票日記·出票日記·轉帳日記·等數簿。若以帳目之性質爲標準，可分立進貨付欵·銷貨收欵·各項開支·銀錢日記等數簿。此外如貨品簿，謄清簿等，莫不可依其性質，分爲數種，此其一也。（二）西式簿記，有所謂憑單記帳法者，卽以憑單代用帳簿。又有所謂統轄記帳法者，卽彙合同類項目記帳，以便過帳及結算。均於記帳事務上，節省極大之勞費。嘗因代辦某紙版公司及某輪船公司之會計事務，（均用西式簿記憑單記帳法）而發現中式簿記簡便的統轄記帳法，行之於某藥房某書局，而成效大著，此其二也。</p>
<p>（三）四柱清册，爲吾國之古法。能善用之，則可根據各分化日記簿及謄清簿，編成每日每月或每年之結算表，可以檢騐每一個期間記帳及計算之有無錯誤；並可表現每一個期間帳目收付之結果，及經過，與比較，較諸西式簿記之平衡試算法，效用尤大，此其三也。有此三點之新發現，故中式簿記，亦能適用於大規模事業之會計，如某大烟草公司某大藥房，某大書局等，其著例也。改良中式簿記，堪稱粗具輪廓。去年以來，决意訂定標準方案，以謀中國簿記普遍的改良，怱怱未果。今年五六月間，應計政學會之邀，講學於南京，聽者多會計學者，間亦涉及此問題，均蒙贊許。而俗務栗碌，久久無成。十月以還，始屛絕諸務，壹志於此。乃成改良中式簿記槪說一書，内分緒論，改良大綱，帳務分類，帳簿組織，帳簿表單格式，及豋記法，記帳規則，等六章出版問世，以求同道敎正。此爲作者對於中國簿記改良之第四時期。</p>
<p>此種改良方案，自覺尙不失爲合理的簿記法。在中國尤可作爲簿記法之標準。以視西洋複式簿記，原則上無不可貫通者。至於帳簿之爲直式，帳法之别收付，書寫之用中文，紙張之爲國貨，雖爲便於推行，但亦未嘗背於複式簿記法之原理原則。他日有暇，尙擬編一簿記書，中式與西式並列，或亦是爲中國簿記法張自也。</p>
<p>凡上所述，皆作者歷年來之經過。今後尙擬於各大學公開演講，於本事務所出版之會計雜誌刊行專號，並於附設之訓練班，添設專科，以謀中式簿記改良運動之進展。幸海内會計專家進而敎之。</p>

<p>— 潘文安</p>
<p>近見報載吾友徐玉書會計師擬訂改良中式賬簿之發行廣告，深以此舉足以革除舊式商家之陋習，完成記賬革命之工作，引爲慶幸。目前承徐會計師將自著「改良中式簿記槪說」見贈！披誦一過，覺其改革要點，以複式簿記爲凖則，而注重固有慣例之保存，此其擘畫之綿密設計之週詳。尤有匠心獨運之處也。</p>
<p>不佞數年來追隨國貨界諸君之後，倡導國貨事業之推進，匡襄贊助，不遺餘力，寒暑幾易，愧鮮成效。每屆歲暮，輙自檢點其已往之工作，深覺所得之成績，不能與我人之努力成正比例。此種失望，雖曰在茲世界經濟衰落國内政局不寗之洲渦中，係屬應有之現象；然我國無經濟會管理制度與社會環境發展之不能相稱，與夫商家財務行政之未入正軌，要亦爲其甚大之原因：請申論如左；</p>
<p>（一）管理制度趨向洋化之流弊　年來實業界人士，憬憧於歐美日本産業合理化之盛行，漸有革新管理制度之覺悟。寖假向一切設施，力仿歐美，惟洋是鶩。顧制度之改進，賴有自給之設備以爲輔助。在技術程度幼稚之中國，所有新制度下應用之設備，距離自給之境尙遠，末流所至，管理設備，遂惟洋貨是賴。我友金慕堯君論「管理制度與國貨運動」，言有言曰；「我國當海通以前，在商品的供求上和西洋是没有發生過關係，民衆所用的物品，自産自給，尙無使用外貨的觀念。我們只消看老式商店裏的設備，就可明白。上收下付的賬簿，硯台筆墨算盤書夾等用具，都是本地風光的土産；但自改革以後，這種陳舊的東西，隨管理制度變更而廢棄。最能表現這種現象的，要算幾家簇新的銀行了，銀行記賬是新式簿記，因爲橫寫且用國際數字的關係，不得不用洋紙，布裝或皮裝的封面以及與之有連帶關係的鋼筆鉛筆墨水紙張，無一而非洋貨不可，甚至我國特産的算盤，也代以來路貨的計算機。這樣，管理制度固然是十足的新式了，可是廢置國貨改用洋貨因而增加貿易的入超，却是一個很嚴重的問題。甚至管理制度愈新式，使用的物品愈洋化。所以在某種意義上，管理制度的變態的革新，是很不合算的一件事。其實當事者也並不是有意要洋化，實在覺得在新式管理制度下，一切用品自以西式較爲便利。」（原文見申報）可謂切中時病。夫提倡國貨之道，貴在推廣其銷路，而在中國今日之生産環境下，管理制度之改良，適足以縮小國貨之市場。似此嚴重之矛盾，實爲當今關心國貨事業人士所急欲解决者。</p>
<p>（二）會計監督之不週　嘗按工廠商號營業之失敗大半起因於内部管理之鬆弛與財務行政之流弊，探本求源，不外乎會計監督之未能週密。良以老式記賬，系統紊亂，項目含混，毫無内部牽制ＩnternalＣhcek之方法。防杜疏懈，弊竇自生。况會計决算之意義，原爲商家營業方針之嚮導，與夫財政狀况之表現：老式賬簿之組織，旣不足以言會計原理，則其對於商家營業之指示，盲人瞎馬，欲其不淪於崩潰者難已。</p>
<p>徐會計師倡導改良中式簿記，在商業管理之革新上，當有不少之助力，而所用之賬簿筆墨，均屬國貨，尤爲難能可貴。利用新式之優點，避免上述第一種之流弊，誠實合我心之舉矣。改良中式簿記之記錄過賬决算製表等手續，均與複式簿記原理相脗合，而方法簡便適宜於舊式賬務人員之採用。將來推行普遍，則國貨廠商財政上之流弊，因以减少，我人向所詬病之第二種困難，似亦可迎刄而解。是我人未來之提倡國貨工作，或可收事半功倍之效矣。</p>
<p>改良中式簿記，對於商業管理會計組織上之貢獻，已如上述。我人於馨香祝禱之餘，尙有認爲値得考慮者二點，謹與徐會計師共資商榷焉：</p>
<h3 id="c236">東西洋簿記法之源流及其分野 <a href="#c236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— 徐永祚</p>
<p>自有人文，乃有書契，記數之制，算數之術，於是起焉。夏侯陽算經序文曰：算數起自伏羲，而黄帝定三數爲十等，隷首因以著九章。意大利古史稱，地中海流城於金屬或陶器記數記事，由來已久。東西洋記數算數之早，與夫計算術簿記術關係之切，蓋可想見。但當初人文幼稚，物用不備；交易往來，旣屬稀有；計算記錄之具，又極笨重；故算數之法，尙屬簡略，記數之具，僅以備忘而已！究未可與言簿記法也。</p>
<p>迨夫文物日進，財貨出納日繁，國計家計，日見重要，計算之術，乃務求詳密吻合；記數之制，亦力謀整齊易算，簿記之術，漸次進化，觀於東西洋古代文明諸國之重視國家會計制度，及算術研究，可以想見其一斑。我國古來之長於會計者，必精於算術，而歐洲古代所遺之簿記書籍，每出於算學家之手，簿記法之隨算學而進化，東西，如出一轍也。</p>
<p>算學之影響於簿記法，英如方程式。凡論東洋簿記法者，每以我國之四柱清册法爲其代表。論西洋簿記法者，每以複式記錄法爲其代表。均以其整齊精密，而有平衡之檢算作法也。考四柱法及複式法，均導源於算學上之方程式。東洋之方程式發達極早，九章算術之第八章，卽爲方程章，此書出於漢代以前，則方程式發生之早，可以想見，故四柱法宋時已經盛行，距今不下千年矣。西洋之方程式·發達較遲。西歷一四九四年巴希隆氏（ＬucasＰaciolo）始於所著數學大全中，立專章曰計算與記錄要論（Ｐarticulalas　de　Ｃomputis　et　Ｌcripturis），運用此式於簿記，而産生複式簿記法，迄今僅四百數十年耳。近世東洋簿記法之變化，胥不出四柱清册法之範圍，西洋簿記法之變化，亦未越複式簿記法之規律，二者名稱不同，而其源流之出於方程式，固無以異也。意者記數之法，以便於算數爲主旨。算數之方法，雖有種種，而其便於賬目之之統計及檢算者，首推方程式。故無論東洋西洋舉凡簿記學諸先哲，自能不謀而合也。</p>
<p>東洋之四柱法，分四柱結算，西洋之複式法應複筆記帳，論者每以爲不同。其實四柱爲舊管·新收·開除·實在·新收爲共收，開除爲共付，實在爲結收或結付，本期之實在，卽次期之舊管。以視西式各種帳目之借項共計，貸項共計，借差或貨差；或其現金出納帳之前存·今收·今付·現存，有何别乎？所異者各種帳目舊管亦獨立，則前後之比較，經過之狀况乃益明，不若西式之僅於現金賬立四柱耳。此以四柱法言，東西洋簿記法原有其共同之點也。複式之原文爲Ｄoubl　eentry；Ｄoppelbuchuug，意爲雙行也，凡遇記帳，應於借方貸方同時並立，換言之，卽每一出入，必有二筆以上之記賬，使其借貸雙方並立。每遇結賬報告，亦應將各項目分列借貸，俾可對照。巴希隆氏所創之複式法，及現代尙留存之大陸式簿記法，固莫不如是也，然自賬簿組織日漸分化，賬簿每以某一特定項目爲本位，記賬時僅記其對方項目，於是就每一分化帳簿言，記載反似單式，須集全體帳簿而爲彙總的觀察，始足明示其複式。賬簿組織之分化愈甚，則各賬簿之記載愈單純，所謂雙行云者，或貸借對照云者，幾乎僅對貸借對照表而言。複式之方法，固已大變矣，今之英美式複式簿記法中，不乏著例。若以此類簿記法，均屬複式，則東洋簿記法，亦有同例。其各種日記簿之以某種特殊項目爲本位，而記其對方項目之出入，謄清簿各賬戶結入資産負債表及損益計算書時之收付上下對列，可以互相對照，且可以平衡結算，蓋與西洋複式之精神同也。此以複式法則言，東西洋簿記法，亦有其共同之現象也。</p>
<p>東西洋簿記法之源流及法則，旣有如上述之共同。然而從事於簿記者，無不能觸類旁通，其故何歟？則除文宇之不同外，尙有一個重大分野在焉。東洋簿記法之記賬，俱分收付，其收付之，所以分，視乎該賬目對於銀錢之爲收爲付。西洋簿記法之記賬，首别借貸，其借貸之所以别，視乎該賬目之對方對於營業者之爲借爲貸。前者之分收付爲主觀的，後者之别借貸爲客觀的。故東洋簿記上之收付，乃銀錢本身之爲收入或付出也，如收入存欵卽記入收項；西洋簿記上之借貸，乃項目本身之爲借主或貸主也，則收入存欵，應記入貸方，此在算學上，其正數負數之配列法正相反，其算數之法同，所得方程式之平衡亦相同，而記數之着手點，則有别矣。財産增减變化之所以表示者，亦互異方向矣。此誠爲東西洋簿記法之一大分野也。論者或稱東洋簿記法爲收付簿記法，西洋簿記法爲借貸簿記法，正以此耳。</p>
<p>東洋之收付簿記法及西洋之借貸簿記法，性質雖不同，而其合於記數算數之正軌則一。使用者旣各具悠久之歷史，自不必强使劉一，且不宜强使劃一也。故研究簿記法者，首當明其源流，辨其分野，因勢而利導之。自十九世記之末，西洋簿記法輸入東洋，好奇炫異者，不知借貸簿記法與收付簿記法之同出於算學上之方程式，以前者之新奇爲可貴，後者之陳舊爲當棄，輒揚彼而抑此，其惑甚矣。今之改良中式簿記，不以收付簿記法爲陳舊而棄之。兢兢焉以科學精神，整理改良。世之明記數算數之源流，及能辨東西文化之分野者，當與有同感也。</p>

<p>凡百商業之出納，無間古今中外，莫不有簿籍之紀錄，從以覘夫財産之增减，及營業之盈話；雖商業之種類有異，業務之繁簡互殊，然簿記上應用之會計學原理，則一也。吾國歷來沿用之中式簿記，以乏組織及系統，每爲世人詬病。今之治會計學者，又都鄙視中式簿記，以爲無足取法，而咸以西式爲宗。雖然，吾國商業上習相應用，遞邅數千年，久而弗替，時至今日，除有數新式企業外，全國大小商業，固仍沿用如故也，是其間必有不可摩滅者在。蓋簿記者，一實用而兼具經濟之科學也。夫旣切實用矣，而又須兼具經濟效果，斯其效能方顯西式簿記雖較中式爲有一定之法度及準繩，然理論深奥，方法繁複，非易相當之訓練，不易從事；養成人材旣費，而紙張文具，又皆外貨，糜費旣多，成本自昂。反之，西式之短，卽中式之長，苟能就中式之短，而加以改良，不較西式更爲美備子？要之，物無分中外，制不論東西，擇善而從之，斯可矣。徐君永祚爲會計師業之先進，邃於所學，　能不附衆論，以改良中式簿記爲已任，而力行倡導之，良具卓識。所著改良中式簿記槪說一書，淺顯易解，理論透澈，設備周祥。擬盯中式簿記表單樣本，註釋簡明，切於實用，繩舉目張，旣具西式之長，復得中式之便，信如著者所云爲中國會會計界謀普遍之進步，而予則敢信其爲中國商界謀普遍之福利，此其收效宏而爲利簿，又豈學術界之盛事也哉。</p>
<p>（一）「改良中式簿記槪說」所論中式簿記之利弊與新制之豋賬手續，訂僞條文，列爲賬式，鈎稽閘發，詳盡明晰，雖素無簿記學識者，循規蹈矩，亦能措置裕如。惟欲期其自生變化。因地制宜，恐尙不足以語此。良以槪說中所列之每一條文，表面雖似僅爲一種手續，向背後尙含有會計學理，在倡導者成竹在胸，固能隨時變化，左右逢源，而學習者拘泥成式，罔知所由，欲其運用自如，吾人尙不敢置信。</p>
<p>（二）舊式商人因襲傳統之思想，浸淫於「各人自掃門前雪」之哲學中，欲其認識改良中式簿記之優點與必要！誠屬與虎謀皮。在此缺乏自動精神之商人社會中，惟有由同業公會在改良管理制度促進營業發展之立場，勸導同業，共起採用；官廳機關，在提倡民衆廉潔，保護債權利益之立場，曉諭商民，（最低限度如公司組織者）力謀更張。</p>
<p>上述二端，僅就隨感所及，用貢參考，誠以望之切，故不覺慮之過也。二二，一二，二一，於四行儲蓄會</p>

<p>近十餘年我國邇出納言會計者，大率皆以改用新式簿記爲務。而政府機關，訖於通都大埠之公司公團，凡其所爲表册簿據，亦旣逐漸推行歸於一致。誠以近代事業之經營管理，所謂科學化合理化者，幾於舉世從同。會計掌資財運用之樞機，而簿記爲帳項收支之實錄。程式所限，學有專科。我國固未可拘泥舊法，而不爲之所也。此其數字之左起橫行，筆墨紙張之仰給外貨，更不容細校也。雖然，吾茲有所惑焉。其惑維何，則新式簿記之推行未必盡適合於我國國情是也。　夫學以致用爲歸，近世科學家者莫不以理論與實務爲並重。前者不佞忝長國立上海商學院，固嘗蘄蘄以造就實用人材爲心。故每當編訂課程選擇敎材之際，輒三復斯旨。簿記會計，蓋所謂實用科學也。實用科學，其類不一，而要以推行普徧功用顯豁爲唯一原則。新式簿記之記帳法，必先借貸分錄。雖結算合符，基於學理，能殊途同歸。然手續繁重，筆錄稽時，理奥難明，易滋紛錯。此與我國舊法截然不同，未易家喻而戶解也。反之，今學校師生治簿記學者，皆曰銀行簿記不難。不知我國舊記帳法分列四柱，而以現金收付爲標準。今銀行會計制度之採用見金分錄法，固暗相脗合者也，故曰不難。徐君撮舊法之精英，袪新制之壅蔽，一是折衷於學理，而歸本於實用，謂之曰改良中式簿記，而能使人一覽知爲中國簿記，開吾國科學獨立之先河，功莫大焉。矧其條理明顯，手續簡括，推行利便，不俟耆龜。新學之士，精習外國科學，得其秘奥，下者徒能襲取皮毛，輒鄙夷中國一切等等，以爲皆不足取，所謂雖典忘祖者，莫斯爲甚。徐君如彼何哉，吾如彼何哉。</p>

<p>— 俞寰澄</p>
<p>幼習咕嗶，於會計爲門外漢：家有商舖，苦舊式簿記之記載不明，檢閱不便，則嘗以己意爲之更改，取其便於檢閱而已，不知所謂學理也。前清光緒季年，湯師蟄先，屬承乏浙江鐵路公司會計之責。當時新舊簿記之爭頗劇，半年餘不能結總具報，蟄師頗憂之。時所謂新簿記者，亦非複式記載，不過略改形式，而持舊簿記者，齗齗謂不可。其實彼此均無所謂也。受職之後；冥行索途，首定分戶科目，次定簿記種類及組織，至形式則全用舊法，亦以已意參考日本鐵路簿記成式爲之。幸而如期結總，具報無誤。然從事半年，未明而起，夜半未息，勞幾成疾，迺請病假而去。其時意所未慊者，余注重造路成本，故力主材料購買與領用，必經會計入帳，而工程師及主管材料者。以爲會計專管現金，疑顧問材料爲軼權，爭持數月，迄未解决。其條料價得轉帳，而交通部且有浙路會計爲各路冠之奬，則繼任朱君壽門之力也。時風氣初開，諳簿記學者，絕氣僅有，從事於洋商及借欵造路之大寫，習其式而不知其理，遷地無所措手足，欲用複式，亦無從爲力。然余深信中式簿記之可用，悉在一般司會計者之因陋就簡，不知記帳理帳法，而又氣專書以啟迪之，遂支離殘缺，不能盡勾稽綜核之事，此余二十八年前之經騐，而常縈諸懷抱者也。近年曾助友人爲招商局改革會計，則專家夥顧，改用複式，爲事轉易。（詳見招商局會計規程，徐玉書先生，卽主持其事者之一），以視浙江鐵路之華路藍縷，勞逸懸異，則時會爲之也。通海將及百年，然簿記沿用，卽商埠鉅肆，海外僑商，舊式猶十之九，複式不及十一，遑論内地經費人才習慣之限制，勢難强爲。徐玉書會計師近有改良中式簿記之作，余懷此問題二十餘年矣，今有人起而解答之，欣喜贊歎，何能自己。謹述回憶之經騐，以相印證。余敢斷言改良中式簿記之收效，必遠勝於提倡西式簿記。太史公不云乎，「最上因之，其次利導之。」以泊用舊簿記之衆，而改良之周密易行，其有助於社會經濟法律各方面，殆爲鉅業。玉書先生其行因之之道乎，敻乎尙矣。二二，一二，一九。</p>

<h3 id="c244">敷衍話 <a href="#c244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— 愼言</p>
<p>說話在這個年　，固然是很不容易，然而天之所以賦人以說話者，却也是一片好心，要使人在能打架，奔走，跳躍，運思之外，更多一種吃飯的本領。但看東西洋各國，無論政界中，商界中，學界中，大凡地位佔得高一些人，那一個没有一副超人的好口才；換句話說，就是說話雖是天賦與人的一種本能，其間却大有高下，也像變戲法一樣的大有巧妙，凡能得此巧妙者，吃飯當然不再成什麽問題，就是要升官發財，也不是難事了！</p>
<p>那末說話的巧妙，究將如何着手研究呢？這可難了！因爲說話也分着好幾十門種類，譬如說冷話啊，說笑話啊，說死話啊，說大話啊，說風凉話啊，說苦話啊，說謊話啊，說鬼話啊，以及說活洛話啊，端的各有巧妙不同，一時那裏學起！而其中更有一門最巧妙而在目前又最時髦的「說敷衍話」，那更是非同小可了！</p>
<p>然而像「今天天氣眞好啊」，「我也是這麽想啊」，「你以爲如何便如何啊」，「過幾天再請你吃飯啊」，這些語句雖然也可以算得是敷衍話的一部份，然而含蓄不深，開門見山，使人家一聽就知道你是在敷衍他，尙何巧妙之有？眞正聰明的人便决不如此說法，他們的敷衍話，往往是下面這兩句。</p>
<p>第一句是「力不從心」。這句話看去似乎是毅然拒絕的意思，絕非敷衍之語，他言下而且還往往有深恨自己没有力量接受你底請求的神氣，看來眞是十分誠懇；然而他的力究竟是否「不從心」，你又怎樣去衡量他呢？更可贊嘆者，他這句話似軟而實硬，你雖欲再牽絲幾句，也說不出口了，因爲他已自己宣告能力破産，你又怎樣去勉强他呢？</p>
<p>第二句是「天下無不了之事」。這是一句多麽富於哲理的話啊！雖然這句話若不是在對一個向你有所請求的人說，儘可把牠歸納於「說死話」的一類裏；但是尙有人向你作何請求的時候，這句話却眞是一句最聰明最巧妙的敷衍話。人家來問你請求時，往往總是滿臉堆著十分嚴重的神氣，經你這麽一說，眞像沸湯潑雲，形勢保管就會鬆下去了。這樣你縱把他的要求完全拒絕，他也斷不恨你，顚倒會很高興，認爲你已在心靈上給與他一種無上的安慰了！</p>
<h3 id="c245">閒暇 <a href="#c245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— 周黎民</p>
<p>「閒暇」兩個字，用再平常一點的話講起來，就是「空的時候」。</p>
<p>咱們中華國民，畢竟都是公子王孫，甚麽國難嚴重，天災人禍，一切置諸腦後，自我逍遙，沉醉於金迷紙醉之塲；别的不說，單就交際塲中友朋見面，總說：「近作何種消遣」？對方一定答道：「閒暇得很，不過作無聊的消遣而已」！可見得貴國國民的閒暇，眞不愧爲黄帝的子孫呵！</p>
<p>鴉片，香烟，牌九，撲克，黄酒，白蘭地，……這是咱國民十足道地的消閒品；咖啡館，跳舞廳，電影場，按摩院，茶館酒肆，……那是咱國人自有道理的消閒場所；無事多閒的阿斗們，享盡世間福。</p>
<p>可是一般閒暇得不耐煩，吃了飯愁不會餓的儍子們，東闖亂子，西招禍事，閙得天翻地覆，民不聊生，眞是何苦來？</p>
<p>其實不必咒詛「閒暇」，更不可消去「閒暇」，該利用許多短的閒暇，人所虛擲的閒暇，以求學問；如英國著名的政治家格蘭斯敦，無論何時總帶一本小書，一有閒暇就看，所以他日積月累，學識淵博，又如電學界著名的發明家法拉台，一面爲人訂書，一面做科學試騐，曾寫信給朋友說：「我所需要的就是時間，我恨不能買到許多「寫意人」的空的鐘頭，甚至空的日子」等是。</p>
<p>設法消除閒暇，閒暇無事的阿斗們，醒醒吧！</p>
<h3 id="c246">故都的公寓 <a href="#c246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— 蘋蘩</p>
<p>離開秀美的故鄕丨蘇州，流浪到北方的一角落；經騐這般的淺薄，到了陌生的地方，甚麽多覺得寒心，好容易尋得一個老鄕，介紹我住到一個很寂靜的公寓裏，就不能算不是困苦中之帮助了！</p>
<p>公寓是北方特式的旅館，那家公寓在偏辭的地方，是靜中有靜了；門口一片曠場，晚上更有靜的野景。我很愛靜，所以心裏很舒服，想提筆多寫些東西。</p>
<p>「一，二，三…四。」剛下筆從外面送來很有紀律的聲調，小孩子鬧玩兒，没有這麽響，可是不停止，我一些寫稿的心思，彼它都趕走了，怎麽也落不下筆，出去瞧瞧吧，四個人一排穿着軍裝，都是我們的革命志士。住公寓有參觀軍事敎育的訓練，倒是意外的收穫。</p>
<p>據他們說道公寓，住的多數是學生，而且大學生，所以白天冷靜地陽光掠過了窗紗，傍晚的時候，純粹的平調，口琴，以及呌不出名兒的外國調節奏起來，雖然半夜裏，還有殘餘的音調流動着。</p>
<p>這種的生活我並不覺得討厭，因爲是初次的書試。</p>
<p>這幾天加緊了，非但午後練軍操，天没亮的時光也怱促打着號。背鄰的一家唱了一夜的話匣子，聽說是請朋友玩。</p>
<p>北方不像江南，剛秋末，下起雪來了，地下白皚皚地。朔風呼呼的颳着，每一間屋裏都裝置了一個煤爐子，有錢人不在乎，用好的煤塊，我同幾個不用塊煤的人一樣用煤球，燒煤球可有煤毒，當天就有人受煤薰，喝了不少酸白菜湯，隔天我也把煤爐子丢在院子的牆角邊</p>
<p>天氣挺冷，不用爐子熬不住，用呢，怕受毒，晚上早點兒睡吧，胡琴兒丨「四郎探母」…從「一，二，三…四」進而爲「衝！殺！」也不過睜着眼躺在炕上。得！這也受不了的，我同掌櫃的說，「没凖兒明天想上南方去。或許搬走！」其實並没這意思。可是當晚就來兩人看房，生意眞不錯！怎麽會這樣有主顧，不得而知了。</p>

<h3 id="c247">「詩人巷」 <a href="#c247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— 春柳</p>
<p>在南京的城圈子以内，有兩條街巷，詩的意境最濃厚，一是城西的龍蟠里，一是城東的棉鞋營。</p>
<p>龍蟠里是夾處於清凉山烏龍潭之間的一條荒巷，一端緊連着山野，天然是富於詩的境味的，棉鞋營却和它完我兩樣</p>
<p>這被稱爲「詩人巷」的棉鞋營，是侷處在鬧市中間的，如南之中正街，北之常府街，都是南京較大的馬路。但這條街的本身却另外有一種清嚴幽靜的意味，十足地像是一首秀美的宋詩。街道是齊整的，兩旁的住戶，一律是水磨磚的門牆，幾乎每一家的牆内都要伸出許多古老的樹柯，這些樹，或是榆樹，或是桐樹，或是桫樹，一交深秋時候，滿街都是晚黄的落葉。特别是街東的一排房子，因爲背後便是「青溪九曲」中最幽豔之一曲，於是家家都築有水閣，我們泛舟秦淮時，可以指認出那裏是覽園那裏是鑑園春園的。</p>
<p>這些宅子的主人翁，差不多都是「詩人」，如鑑園是屬於吳鑑泉的，春園原名濠堂，是屬於鄭孝胥的（現在當然不必談了），而陳散原先生昔日的散原别墅，也是去這裏不遠的。</p>
<p>最近一次走過這「詩人巷」，偶然闖進幾家園子裏去看看，都刻露地顯出一種衰敗之象，聽說某宅主人最窘，欠市政局的房捐且已欠下十幾個月了不覺想起了宋人的一首詩；「茅檐月有個錢稅，稻飯等無一粒租，生事蕭條人問我，水芭蕉與石菖蒲」。</p>

<p>他把兩件事聯續在一齊想着，免不得就認爲是一件事，於是臉上紅潮突起，連耳朶根子下，都發起熱來。因爲臉上也發熱了，就不敢向母親看着了，一個翻身向裏，半閉着眼睛睡了。就聽到江氏道：什麽時候了，還睡拉，起來罷。桂枝没有作聲，依然側身睡着。江氏道：又是身體不好嗎？起來坐坐罷，别眞個睡出病來了。桂枝待要說話，母親的一隻手，已經撫摸到自己的額頭上來，他道：喲！你額頭上不怎樣熱。臉上倒怎麽有些發燒呢？到了這個時候，桂枝却是不裝病也不可能，使拖着柔軟的聲音道：也許是昨日出去吹了一口風，又把病帶發了。那倒是不要緊，我睡到十點鐘起來，把精神恢復進來，病就好了。江氏笑道：那裏還有十點鐘，等晚上的罷，這也就該吃午飯了。桂枝由棉被裏伸出兩隻手來，伸了一個懶腰，微笑道：我眞想不到，糊裏糊塗的，會睡到這個時候，這可了不得，說着，在坑裏邊抓了自己的衣服，披在身上，就走下坑來。走到窗戶邊，伸着頭向外一看，到了什麽時候。天色不曾看得清楚，棹子上斜支起了一而鏡子，却照着自己臉色黄黄的，兩個眼眶子，似乎也就陷落下去不少。看到之後，不由自己心裏嚇了一跳，何至於一天的病，就把自己病到這種樣子？怪不得人家說相思病可以想死人了。這種事情，只有自己心裏明白，若是讓母親知道了，却說我這姑娘爲人不正，再說，趙自强對我很是忠實的，我不嫁他就不嫁他，他不能怪我，我旣然嫁他，爲什麽又三心二意的呢？得了！從今以後，什麽甘二爺甘三爺，我决計不管。他想到了决計不管的時候，心裏下了一百廿分的决心。問時，他的一隻脚就在地下頓了一頓。江氏在身後看到同道：好好的，你又起急了，怎麽啦？（二七六）</p>

<h3 id="c255">我們的遭遇 <a href="#c255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>陳衡哲先生游美歸來，在燕京大學講演重游北美的幾點感想。其中說到美國知識階級所蒙失業恐慌的慘霧。她在美國遇到的六位同學，都是大學畢業生，知識才能都在水平線以上，有的還有獨具的技能。「但他們中間没有一個不感到失業的恐慌，有位置的感到位置的不穩固，没有位置的感到找事的難辛」。有一位還對陳先生說：「假如你不帮助我到中國去的話，我就只好跳赫貞江了」！「萬方一慨，八表同昏。」美國的知識分子，其境遇可憐如此；以視我們中國的知識分子，「伯仲之間耳」！美國的大學畢業生要去跳赫貞江，而我們的詩人果然跳下揚子江了。</p>
<p>跳江自殺，有人說是「意志薄弱」；意志薄弱，容或有之；但意志即堅强又如何民？佛爾禮（Ｆerri）（意大利犯罪學家）說：「在人底心身上，没有再勝於飢餓的毒害的了。飢餓是一切非人情的，反社會的感情的根源；飢餓線上，甚麽愛，甚麽人情，都不可能。」在飢餓線上，意志堅强則表現爲觸法犯禁。所謂知識分子，還没有觸法犯禁的勇氣；身上穿着長衫，不好意思走出禮義圈子似的；因此，只有兩條路可走：一條路是賣身，一條路是自殺。其不甘於汚辱自己的人格的，那只好「自殺」了。屈原行吟澤畔，形容枯槁；漁父曉之曰：「聖人不凝滯於物，而能與世推移。世人皆濁，何不掘其泥而揚其波？衆人皆醉，何不餔其糟而歠其釃？」屈原曰：「吾聞之，新沐者必彈冠，新浴者必振衣，安能以身之察察，受物之汶汶者乎？寗赴湘流，葬於江魚之腹中，安能以皓皓之白而蒙世俗之塵埃乎？」朱湘先生在大解脫的一刹那間，必覺得「還我清白身」之足以自傲也！</p>
<p>王陽明龍場瘞旅，涕泣告其僕曰：「吾與爾猶彼也！」朱湘先生的遭遇，便是我們的遭遇。這一年間，我的一位朋友，因爲飢餓，替人犧牲，留下老母孤女去了。又一位朋友，盲腸炎大發，臨終時還盤計什麽地方的月薪可以預支，什麽地方的聘約快要送來，終於無以爲殮。這些悲慘的結局，豈不與朱湘先生投江自殺一樣的使人傷懷嗎？難道祗有浩浩大波，是我們歸宿的處所嗎？</p>
<h3 id="c256">我也談納蘭成德 <a href="#c256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>— 陳子展</p>
<p>多謝陳梁先生介紹了納蘭成德的詩論，因爲淥水亭雜識是不容易見到的。在這詩論裡恰恰證明了納蘭成德的詞並没有什麽了不起，他的巴掌剛好打在他自己的臉上。</p>
<p>近體起而古詩廢，詞起而詩廢，曲起而詞廢，納蘭成德是知道了的。當時崑曲還算保有餘勢，何以他不作曲而作詞？他說「作詩欲以言情耳，法乎今之世，近體足以言情矣。」這話我也認爲十分對，何以他提筆言情，不作近體詩，而作廢之久矣的詞呢？他說，「好古之士，本無其情，而强效其體，以作古樂府，殊電無謂。」難道好古之士，本無其情，而强效其體以作詞，就算殊覺有謂嗎？他說，「宋人歌詞，而唐人歌詩之法廢，元曲起而詞廢，南曲起而北曲廢，今世之歌鹿鳴，塵飯塗羹也。」當日雅樂歌鹿鳴，固然是塵羹塗飯。詞已不可歌，也就没有人歌，連塵羹塗飯都不如，何以他偏要把詞當飯吃呢？他的詩論是「反模倣主義」的，我也承認，但他自己却是一個十足的模倣主義的詞人。雖然，他也有所謂自度曲，恐怕未必可歌，也就未便算是創作罷。</p>
<p>在詞的歷史上，最初一個偶像是李後主，最後一個偶像是納蘭成德，甚至有人說納蘭成德就是李後主的化身，這眞是鬼話。王國維以納蘭成德以後第一人自命，所以他最恭維李後主，又很恭維納蘭成德。在滿清一代詞人中，王國隹只看見一個納蘭成德，其他各家都不在眼的。究竟納蘭成德有什麽了不起呢？</p>
<p>他是大學士明珠的兒子，康熙皇帝的侍衛，有了優裕的生活，有了優越的敎養，有了優美的環境，倘若他不是天生白痴，而且肯利用他的相當的天才於塡詞一道，得到相當的成就，本來不算什麽。何况詞這東西，當其盛時，描寫的主要人物，不出特殊階級化身的公子佳人，描寫的實際生活不外乎特殊階級享樂的醇酒婦人歌唱，以納蘭成德那樣風流豪侈的公子哥兒模倣這樣的詞，自然是可以成功的。恰好他的愛妻死了，悼亡歎逝，不覺流露於字裡行間，罩上了很濃厚的感傷氣分。恰好他做侍御，常常陪皇帝出遊，騎射郊獵，引起了他的邊塞悲凉之感。同時他是進士，又自命風雅，得和嚴繩孫顧貞觀姜宸英陳維崧一般大名士往來。因此，他爲顧貞觀救了一個充軍寗古塔的朋友吳兆騫，這種熱情俠氣，也成了他的詞的一部分，而且是最被文人傳誦的一部分，清史列傳，說他的詞，當時傳寫徧於村校郵壁，或許不是十分溢美之辭罷。倘若我們要說納蘭成德的詞有什麽了不起的地方，我以爲就在這裏了。</p>
<p>「開口捉筆，駟馬不及，非易事也。」那位以才子自命的公子哥兒，要是没有淥水亭雜識論及詩詞，「衝口亂駡」，他給人駡的資料也許少些。</p>
<h3 id="c257">割稻客 <a href="#c257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>— 盛煥明</p>
<p>待稻穗重得將垂下頭的時候，官道上，絡續的，幾乎隨時可見到「割稻客」了。他們挑起一個草蓆包，竹扁擔的另一頭則放着一些零星的東西及幾件洗換的衣服。喘着氣，發出一二百里外一帶地方的口音走過去。</p>
<p>這時，田多點的人家，就得計劃今年該雇用幾個割稻客了。割稻客大都很耐勞，鮮有靠不住的。他們大多是東方面人，因收穫期較我們這邊遲上些時候，所以乘這時期離家跑一趟外地，賺點錢，或是帶點什麽回去。</p>
<p>家鄕的收穫期的確是特殊的早，天氣還那末酷炎薰人，稻子却可收割了。正唯如此，割稻客在未被雇之前能憇在鄕城相接的那座十三孔的大石橋上，他們暫時的家就是這露天的橋，生活當然難佳，小孩見到割稻客路過時，便會哼起嘲謔他們的歌來：相傳割稻客是要拾大橋上的西瓜皮啃來解渴的，這情形也許眞有，因爲在未被雇前，頗有不少人是囊無分文的。</p>
<p>等規定了收割期後，需要短工帮忙的人家就到那座大石橋一帶物色割稻客了。爲了割稻客很多，所以選擇起來也特别苛。倘若雇得特别早，那末對那些囊無分文急待被雇的割稻客，也要用「供需律」的原則，把工價打個折扣。或者是雇得格外遲，割稻客則更免不了跌價。</p>
<p>至於我家的割稻客却有定規的：到差不多的時候，那四個老割稻客總自己來了。他們是一家人，來時還要送點土産，彼此却像遠親一樣。祖父揮着麥桿扇，和他們談着一年來的莊稼情形，親切地。他們是祖父壯年時就用下來的！二十年來，這四個割稻客除掉桂土依然外，雖都由他們的後輩來接辦，但這决無損於彼此的信任。</p>
<p>「桂土他們也得來了，怎麽丨」因爲時期已急迫，祖父惶急起來。</p>
<p>「還是先到大橋上雇幾個來吧！」「長年」說。</p>
<p>祖父不願接受這話，二十多年來的情感和信任不能使他那末做，他瞻望着眼前金黄色的原野吁了口氣，慢慢地向田間踱去。</p>
<p>漸漸的，村裏已瀰漫了濃厚的稻草香。祖父終於躁急地向着官道的遠方太息了：「唉唉！我眞想不到！想不到！」</p>
<p>晚上，一個蒼老的客出現在大門外，年齡和祖父相差不遠，他用袖管抹着額上的汗水，咳着。是八年前的老客根土，二十年前祖父最稱道的割稻客。</p>
<p>祖父顯然是愕着，但接着就感動得澀了嗓音：「老子，我們都不中用了！」</p>
<p>客用了蒼黄的眼光瞅着祖父，太息着：「唉，蓉叔，你們稻還没開割嗎？我今年對不住你！他們不能來了！」</p>
<p>「怎麽？」祖父楞着，旱烟管打嘴唇邊滑下來。</p>
<p>「是的，蓉叔，他們今年不能來，我的那個兄弟丨桂土，春天就「過輩」了！」</p>
<p>「呵…」祖父蒼黄的眸子發出爍爍的光彩來。</p>
<p>「那兩個孩子，没出息，都去當了兵，蓉叔，那是我的過處，我們的幾畝租田都被退掉了，三畝「已田」夠得一家四口什麽吃用？「逼上梁山」丨我今年眞對不住你，蓉叔，我爲了過意不去故所以特地趕來捎個信，帮工還没雇嗎？」</p>
<p>「丨還没雇丨還没雇…」祖父失神地答。「我等你們來，根土，你何必定給孩子去「當兵吃糧」呐，好男不當兵好鐵不打釘，你你，丨桂土有一男半女留下來嗎？」</p>
<p>「並没，他没娶過親，他孤孤零零的過了這一世，我眞眞對不起爺娘。」</p>
<p>「你應該招個回來，後嗣是要緊的」祖父咳嗆着說：「丨後嗣…你得捎個信去招個回來…」</p>
<p>×　×　×　×　×</p>
<p>以後，每當稻穗重得將垂下頭，官道上見到割稻客的時候，祖父總睜着老花眼，瞧着金黄色的原野；喃喃的和兒孫輩談起根土和他的後人來。</p>

<p>— 莫泊桑李維克著譯</p>
<p>她現出像是瘋了的樣子。他恐怖極了，突然跪在床前低低說道：</p>
<p>「不要說了，媽媽，不要說了。」</p>
<p>她以一種驚人的决心和毅力站了起來。</p>
<p>「可是我再没有什麽話可和你說了，我的孩子，永别了。」</p>
<p>她向着房門走去。</p>
<p>他伸開兩臂抱住她，呌道：</p>
<p>「你做什麽，媽媽，你到那裏去？」</p>
<p>「我不知道……難道我知道嗎……我再没有什麽事好做了……因爲我現在祗剩一個人。」</p>
<p>她掙扎着想要逃走。他抓住她，他祗會反覆地呌着：</p>
<p>「媽媽……媽媽……媽媽……」</p>
<p>她一面用力想脫出他的懷抱，一面說：</p>
<p>「不要抱住我，不要抱住我，我現在已不是你的母親了，我現在和你，和任何人都没有一點關係了，什麽關係都没有了！你是旣没有父親，也没有母親了，我可憐的孩子……永别了」</p>
<p>他忽然領會到假使讓她走了，他便再也不能見到她，於是他抱起她，把她放在一把安樂椅上，强迫她坐下，隨後他跪在她面前用兩臂攔住她：</p>
<p>「你絕不能離開此地，媽媽；我愛你，我要留着你。我要永久　地留着你，你是屬於我的。」</p>
<p>她以一種被壓服了的聲音低低說道：</p>
<p>「不行，我可憐的孩子，這是不可能的事情。今晚你哭，而明天你便會把我丢到門外。你」</p>
<p>也不會原諒我的。」</p>
<p>他以那樣熱烈而又出乎眞愛的呌聲回答：「啊！我嗎？我嗎？你多麽不了解我啊！」使她聽着，竟至感動到發出一個呌聲，用兩手抓着他的腦袋，猛烈地拉到自己面前，狂熱地抱吻着他。</p>
<p>隨後她一動也不動，把自己的臉孔緊貼着兒子的臉孔，隔着鬍鬚，她感到了他的肉的熱；她凑着他的耳朶，輕輕對他說道：</p>
<p>「不對，我的小哲安。你明天不會原諒我的。你自己以爲你會原諒我，但這是靠不住的。你今晚原諒了我，並因此救了我的性命；可是得讓你不再看見我才行。」</p>
<p>他緊摟着她，再三說：</p>
<p>「媽媽，不要說這樣的話！」</p>
<p>「眞的，我的乖寳，我非走不可。我旣不知道要到什麽地方去，也不知道要怎樣辦，也不知道要怎樣說，可是我非走不可。我如果不走的話，我會不敢看你，也不敢抱吻你，你懂嗎？」</p>
<p>於是這回他也低低地凑着她的耳朶說：</p>
<p>「親愛的媽媽，你會留在這裏的，因爲我要這樣，因爲我需要你。你得立刻發誓聽從我的話。」</p>
<p>「不，我的孩子。」</p>
<p>「啊！媽媽，非這樣不行，你聽到嗎？非這樣不行。」</p>

<h3 id="c259">優生法律 <a href="#c259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>— 非人</p>
<p>二十日哈瓦斯電，德國政府所頒行之消滅生殖機能法律，定於明年一月一日起實行，大約將有患遺傳病者四十萬人，適用此項法律。</p>
<p>我看了這段電文，忽然發生一種感想，咱們貴國，索號病夫，原是天下聞名的，倘把這種法律，施行到敝國來，我恐適用此項法律的，何止四十萬人，就是四百萬人，或四千萬人，還是不夠，不過這種法律，倘眞能到咱們貴國來不但優生，到是一個絕妙的救國方案，因爲咱們貴國的弄不好多是生殖機能的作祟。</p>
<p>生殖機能的爲害，就咱們貴國看來，最大最普通的一種害處，就是傷風敗俗，因爲咱們貴國的格言，「是妻不如妾，妾不如妓，妓不如婢，婢不如偷」的格言，咱們貴國的人們，多有深切的領悟，所以法庭上關於風化罪的，十椿到有九椿之多，若把德國的法律實施到敝國來，非但法庭的庭長推事們，要省許多麻煩，而咱們的禮敎，豈不更能維持於不敝麽，這一點原當是很小小的效能。</p>
<p>若更推而廣之，有了生殖器，首先須要的就是家庭，有了家庭，於是乎有子女，於是乎有孫子，於是乎有曾孫玄孫以及不可知之孫，若有了家庭，於是乎須要維持家庭的經濟，於是乎要儲積起來，維持子子孫孫的經濟，假定不能維持的話，於是乎去騙，去奪，去偷，去搶，去刧，去搜，去刮，種種作奸犯科的事，無一非從生殖器上發生出來。</p>
<p>尤其是咱們貴國，現在正大鬧其人口過剩，大鬧其失業恐慌，大鬧其天災人禍，大鬧其民不聊生，倘使把德國的「消滅生殖機能法律」，一齊適用到咱們貴國四萬萬的人民，到是一個總解决的辦法，倘使人口不致過剩，也就不會大鬧失業恐慌，旣無失業恐慌，於是你搶我奪，作奸犯科的事自少，不過這種法律，須得換一名詞，不呌優生法律，可呌優死法律。</p>
<p>咱們貴國的人民，其他學問，都没有講究，而優生學，到是人人研究過的，不但研究，而且精明，諸位不信，我且舉兩個例來作證，不但河北的小四子和小三子學問高强，你看江北婦人討飯的時候，手中抱了一個不算，還要携了一個，跟了一個，說不定草棚中還有幾個大的提了籃，賣扦光地栗，或者賣花生米呢，就在上海住民來看，一個弄堂，祗有十念號門牌，而聚集攏來的孩子，往往有四五十名的多，這樣製造中的出品，總算是豐富極了。</p>
<p>現在有幾位慈悲而高明的人，往往嘆天災人禍，往往嘆戰爭不息，殺人如麻，我想假定年年風調雨順，天下太平下去，若照生物學原理講起來，現在何止四萬萬人，就是十萬萬人，也恐不止，人口還要過剩，失業還要恐慌，如此看來，幾位殺人的魔王，倒是救世的眞主，可知耶穌自有道理也，亞門。</p>
<h3 id="c260">聖誕節的禮物 <a href="#c260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>— 立</p>
<p>是聖誕節頭一天的傍晚。密雲佈滿着上空。從那似乎壓得很低的天際，正浮出一種沉鬱蒼茫的顔色。半空中貯積得過多的　　氣被西藏路一　的　　　和三公司上接雲霄的年紅燈光所混凝，幻成一片桃色的雰霧，把這都市中心區整個地題　起來了。從西北吹來的寒風，這時更充分顯出威力，碰着馬路上的行人，就給以砭肌入骨的剌戟；碰肴高樓巨厦的墻壁，就轉折迴旋，發出慘而且銳的呌號。這種酷冷而陰晦的天氣，　　　念　　追促的　意。</p>
<p>這時　立在跑馬　　　的紅　包　告的紅藍相間的燈光，已開始一明一暗，很有節奏地砭閃着，下面大鐘的長短針，正在一上一下，配搭成了一條埀直線。馬路上的人在今晚特别擁擠，往來的公共汽車和電車，每一趟都是裝得像籤筒似的，揷滿了兩足動物，停在每一站口，很費力地把一堆一堆的人衆吞吐着，啣頭接尾的汽車，各自張開着光燄射人的大眼睛，不斷在紅綠燈的指揮之下，一連幾十輛排成一條直線，開着很慢的馬達在向前推進。一片「大晚夜報」，「大美夜報五個銅板！」的呌賣聲很快地佈滿了各大街小弄。</p>
<p>在大新街新旅館的轉角，沿馬路上突起一陣很微弱的求告之聲：「老板！作好事罷！修福修壽，多子多孫，可憐窮人……賞個巴銅板好買碗稀飯……老板！先生！這正是從癟三「蹺脚阿義」口裏迸發出來的一套他唸得可以倒背的「歌訣」，他這時正在追逐一個過路的「君子」。</p>
<p>緊追不捨，歌訣越唸越快的結果，簡直是「有志者事竟成」，公然從那過路「君子」的兩眼中，先投過來一道兼有「嗤鼻」，「討厭」，「惡心」，「不耐煩」，「快些滾」種種表情的目光，接着掏出來一丢！！雖則只是一個銅板，但因爲使氣一擲之故，落在阿義那又乾又　的手裏，却顯得很有分量！這銅板在阿義的荷包裏，掛了「第十號」，是多麽「不祥」的一個數目啊！</p>
<p>大凡一個年近「知命」的日暮途窮的淪落者，在他的過去生命歷程上，都有一個「相當年，何等……」的黄金時代，蹺脚阿義，自然也不能例外。</p>
<p>在他二十歲，　謂正是「一條好漢」的時候，他在王大帥的麾下，已經由當「弟兄」而爬　了「拖糧子」，成爲一個起碼的「尉」　官丨丨排長了。惡仗打了不止一次，但是：爲甚麽打？打誰？這太高深的問題，他當然夠不上去求了解。那時還是馮國璋作大總統，當然也没有「討伐反革命」，「剿赤」這些玩意。有一次在開拔時，大帥曾對各級官佐「訓話」，不幸這位排長又坐得太遠，只看見大帥口吐白味，喊出「弟兄們！拼命去！打趙××那個王八蛋做的混小子！」一片的「誓師」之詞。</p>
<p>不幸那一次打「混小子」的結果，阿義帶了「彩」，這就是他「拖糧子」的生活的結束，也就是他變成「蹺脚阿義」的由來。以後，阿義一降而爲管弄堂的人，再降就成爲現在沿街呌討的「馬路巡閱使」了。</p>
<p>今天，恰遇着上流社會「狂歡之夜」的前一晚，馬路上的太太老爺們都忙於買東西；誰還管得到像「蹺脚阿義」這一些「下作胚子」！阿義　三點鐘就求老板，呌太太太地開始工作，弄到現在，口袋内除了銅元有一十三太保」而外，就是從各電車站人堆的脚下拾得的半打烟屁股。</p>
<p>他繞了幾條馬路，最後從新世界折到大馬路，拖着那沉重無力的兩條腿，朝外灘移動。那伸手向路人唸「歌訣」的方法，今天額外弗靈，十次只有一次得法。後來，在過度的人望之下，他索性不向人乞討，專心看各商店電炬通明，玻璃窗内的陳列品了。各玻璃窗裏面，除了大半照例應景，排着一兩個白髮紅顔，笑容可掬的聖誕老人和紅綠相映的聖誕樹而外，就是各種花色的米古力，西點，成堆的罐頭和大瓶小甑的洋酒，從各菜館，點心店裏，不斷噴出來煎炒　溜的熱菜的香味，直頂阿義的鼻孔。他感到自己恐慌已久的五臟六腑，這時不但在「呌口號」，而且在開始「騷動」！</p>
<p>抛球場亨達利時鐘的短針，已經指正到「二」字上面，那疲乏得幾乎要斷的兩條脚，把阿義拖到了華懋飯店的對過，匯中飯店的門口。玻璃裏面的外國紳士，高等華人，太太名媛們正在燈紅酒綠，音樂悠揚的雰圍中，互相摟抱而舞。阿義不覺看得出神，同時想到自己在從前「拖糧子」時所玩過的那些「花姑娘」們。他不知不覺地踏上了石級，把頸子像鷺鷥一樣伸着朝裏面越看越忘其所以。突然一個拿「哭喪棒」的「阿三」從裏面衝了出來，「照例」在他屁股尖上踢了一脚，同時口裏操着洋涇浜式的「國駡」咕嚕着：「娘個臭□！滾！」</p>
<p>蹺脚阿三由迷惘中覺醒了，他也算得到了一種「聖誕節的禮物」丨丨一隻外國「火腿」！</p>

<p>— 丁丁</p>
<p>初冬的時份，終于接着深秋而降臨了。一切都呈現着冬的現象。天又下雨了，幷且雨下得不小，雨點擊着屋瓦發出來的聲音，耳朶裏是很可以聽得到。物界是這樣的靜寂，唯有鐘聲滴答和簷裏水流的淙淙聲。啊！大約時已十一時了吧！昨晚現在正是文女士絕氣後的最後一秒鐘，呵？她已死去整整的一日了。在落葬的時候祗有她的母親。大槪她今年祗有二十二歲。呵！我記起了，在我第一次和她分離後的重遇，是在四馬路××酒樓的晚上，那晚因舅舅新重鄕下回來，我的媽和哥哥請他在××酒樓吃夜飯，舅舅說他在鄕下聽說上海有什麽妓院裏面有粉白脂紅的雪白大姑娘，是專操淫業爲生……因此媽就命哥哥寫了三張局票，就呌茶房送了去，呌局的原因是給舅舅見識見識什麽是上海的所謂的妓女，局票送去了後，我們依舊言歸正傳的談我們自己的正經事，但是祗聽得隔壁左右的小房間裏，都發出了「烏烏牙牙」的胡琴聲和清脆的唱聲。</p>
<p>一個妓女走進來了，例有一個跟着的「小先生」和等在外面的「烏師」，是「那一位的？「邊問邊在我哥哥身旁坐下子，「不，我是呌你來給這位老人家看看的，你去坐在這位老人家的旁邊給他老人家談談吧。」這是哥哥指着舅舅對如簡短的回答。「你們的烏師跟來没有？唱只戲來聽聽哪！」這是媽的話，於是我們小小的一間中也就烏烏拉拉的唱了起來。</p>
<p>第二個「堂差」又進來了。「唉！你們這種好好的女子爲什麽要來幹這種丢臉的事呀丨除了這，什麽事都不可以幹了嗎？你們這些不幸的女孩兒，簡直是入了人間地獄了呀！……呌一呌是一塊錢嗎？好，拿去了走吧。」舅父仰起了他的老花眼望了望這些妓女分别給了一塊錢，令她們走了。「呵丨這種女子眞是女子中的敗類，虧她們來幹這種的生涯，男子的玩物，人間的寄生虫……」我望了她們的後影厲聲的詈駡着。</p>
<p>這第三個被呌局的妓女終於也來了，啊！我有些不相信自己的眼睛了：她不是文嗎？我呌出了聲來。她看見了我，滿面慚愧羞恥而畏縮地偷偷地退走了。雖然只一刹那，但我能確定她是文，我初中裏的同學，於是我記起了某友告訴我關係她底事來了。大槪是因爲她家庭受了經濟的壓迫，父母便拿她這個有姿色的女學生的女兒，像商一樣地犧牲了她終身的幸福。她因欲挽救她那天賦的自由權，於是奮鬥而宣告向家庭脫離了。那時，她就有一個野心：她欲以她僅有的一些初中的學識來謀她獨立的生活！可是呀：生活予青年人的是太苛刻了，處處都給她碰了壁，並且殘酷地向她鞭策着！因此她就入了火坑而操她皮肉的生涯了。</p>
<p>大槪已經十一點鐘了，文女士已整整地死去了一日了。天還是繼續地加速地冷，雨也没有停地下着，下着，冬的現象到哪！</p>

<p>— 欲歸</p>
<p>都市通訊之二</p>
<p>鄕下人；</p>
<p>從報館中出來，已是暮色蒼茫的時候了。我埋緊頭在聳起的大衣領中，踏上南京路的行人道。這裏是個瘋狂的世界，汽車追隨着電車狂馳，黄包車夫的飛毛腿也分外的勁　霓虹燈的光芒使人不信上海有晝夜之分，就是扮着苦臉來求乞一個銅板的盲目女丐也異常可愛。我想快一點回到我的憇休處，對於這個世界丨丨瘋狂的世界，没有什麽留戀，加緊脚步向前走，被一個鰻一樣游着的腰肢阻止了去路。她是那樣的輕盈，綢質旗衫的下襲被瘋狂的風吹　着，華爾滋的舞步是那樣迷人，我似乎跌進了春的抱懷；但是那鰻女的頸上已明明是黑色的皮領，於是我努力探起頭來向這瘋狂的世界作一個透視的檢閱。對面水菓舖的門前，　起一個鉛管的女烟囱，像梅蘭芳登台排場似的，由無數明亮的電燈圍着一塊良鄕名栗的牌子强有力的印進我的腦神經，我不信上海的季候，在一條馬路的兩旁有這末大的區别？我一邊想着我這個怎會跑進這個瘋狂了的世界，一邊跟着那美麗的線條向前走，及至我記清我是從那陰沉的報館編輯室中出來的，那鰻樣的身體已投進了一家綢緞舖，我舉起頭來望見他們旗幟上也明明寫着「冬」季大減價，這時候我纔肯定「冬」是來了，不過在這瘋狂的世界中連扮着苦臉來求乞一個銅板的盲目女丐也異常可愛！</p>
<p>我迅速地跑回家來。鄕下人，我的家是不滿方丈的亭子間，不到六句鐘二房東是不開燈的，天已是暗下來，我抽起一枝烟，躺在那三塊錢買來的行軍床上，於是幻想從我腦筋中反映出來，幸虧咱們窮人還有這一點權利。譬如明明是白化一塊錢，然而五萬元的希望總可以使你做幾天富翁的夢的。</p>
<p>是冬天了。我家後園中的冬青樹不知已修剪得那末齊整嗎？阿火這孩子是怪懶的，我在家的時候，一切頑皮的把戯他却總有份，要他做一點事，非騙他今夜不凖吃夜飯，是不肯動手的。細算起來，我已五年没有歸家，五年的光陰把自己變成了一個五十歲的老翁。阿火也不會十三歲的那個模樣了，他一定早已將冬青樹修剪整齊，一切枯爛了的芟草也剷除乾凈，或者他已能帮助長年打稻。阿火他這怪可憐的孩子，不知他也像我一般的被驅逐了嗎？</p>
<p>園後的農場，現在正上勁的時候。家　幾畝田，如其想到這瘋狂的世界中來是没有福份的。在鄕下僱佣幾個長年自耕自種，生活還是應付裕如的。一鄕人幾百條性命所盼望着的冬天，在咱們都市中人没有知覺之前在鄕下已熱烈的歡迎她的來臨。田中的稻，一年辛苦所得的代價，高高的一堆安放在農場上，打的打，篩的篩，幾頭感到冬已來到的小麻雀飛聚攏來在場角打些野食，牠們都那樣的不避人。然而在上海有個什麽比賽，是作爲驚人的舉動的。</p>
<p>朋友，據說我們隔壁看鴨的招姐跟人偷跑了。一個拖着兩條小辮子的小女孩也會跟人偷跑，噢，不，招姐也像阿火一般的年紀了，一個十八歲的大姑娘！然而她跑到那裏去呢？東村？西村？都是瞞不了的，所以我得問起一聲，阿祥那小皮匠還在我們鎭上嗎，他是專門拐騙鄕下的女孩子販賣到上海來丨丨因爲上海的罪惡是需要他們來造成的。請你告訴我，或者我能找到這火坑中的孩子。</p>
<p>幻想眞是奇怪的東西，那盞五枝光電燈一亮之後，我的髓筋中滾着的又是那鰻一樣游着的腰肢，汽車追隨着電車　那個異常可愛的盲目女乞丐，小小的亭子樓像在瘋狂的世界中旋轉……</p>

<h3 id="c263">利息可以要求免掉嗎？ <a href="#c263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我現在有件關於法律上的疑問，向你詢問，請你就能給我一個指示。</p>
<p>事情是這樣的：在十年前，我的父親，向人家借了八百塊錢，用作塡店裏的虧蝕：當時拿一所房屋的契據作爲抵押的。這筆錢不用說是每年要付息的；但在五六年前，自己的店，因不能維持而關閉了，因之這筆利息，也就因付不起而停止了，直到現在，恐怕也有五六年之久。那知前月那個債主，突然住到我家現在住的，也就是以前拿契據押給他的那所屋子裏來；無論如何，不肯搬出去，一味强橫的不是要錢，就是要我們把屋賣給他。以致到現在，還住在那屋子裏没有解决。</p>
<p>因此，先生，下面幾個問題請你給我解答一下。</p>
<p>（一）這筆錢的利息，已付了等於本錢同樣的數目，以後幾年未付的利息，可否免掉，如果在法律上講？</p>
<p>（二）因爲不還他錢，而强佔了房屋，假使在當時的筆據上没有寫明不還錢時，就可住屋的明文，那現在我們可不可以也强迫的驅逐他出去？</p>
<p>（三）如果他不講情理，而一味蠻來，那應當用怎樣的步驟去對付？</p>
<p>（四）假使相見於法庭時，可否要求將幾年未付的利息免除，而本錢分期償還，或減免若干？（因已付過等於本錢的利息。）</p>
<p>（五）假使被判須令全部償還，而一時没錢償還時，其結果將如何？</p>
<p>先生，上面幾個問題，我以讀者的資格，請你　給我一個圓滿的答復。本來，　這樣無聊的事本　　你　　　是很抱歉的　但是除了問你　有　能給我答復呢？所以不　　昩了。　　的地方，我是銘感的。　徐翰笙謹上</p>
<p>×　×　×</p>
<p>編者按：民法對於年利不超過二分的利息，是准許而且保障的。因爲借用的時期延長，發利息等於甚或超過本金，是適法的。所以徐君要想請對方讓步，祗能夠情商，而不依賴法律。</p>
<p>原抵押據，並未載明「不還錢，可住屋」一類的條文；而對方竟住進來了，這當然是他的不是。徐君可以報告公安局，請求阻止這種侵權行爲；民事部份，由他再向法院起訴。</p>
<p>但是最後的結果，法院當然會責令將本利如數清償；徐君如其無力償付，他當然要請求執管抵押物。如其你說該屋價値，高出於你應當償付額之外，那麽可以標賣。總之情面一破，相見法庭，債務責任，是絲毫不能希冀减輕的。</p>
<p>所以我們主張，徐君還是向對方情商，本利兩方，他能夠允許減免多少，就是你的便宜。數目結定後償付的方法有三丨（一）仍以這所房屋，向這原債主抵押，事實上祇須將舊的借據收還，另立新據，把其中的數目，加到與本利和相等。</p>
<p>（二）將這所房屋爲抵押，另向他人借一筆欵子，來對付這債主。</p>
<p>（三）他旣要你這房屋·你就割愛賣給他。他一高興起來，一方面本利允你酌減，另一方面，將房價些微提高，你就便宜多了。你要明瞭，不動産於窮人，是無利的，牠的孶息，决不能像你因欠了債而所付的子金一樣高。</p>

<p>— 張老三</p>
<p>（三十九）兩條腿凍得紅紅的</p>
<p>這一個陰暗的黄昏，在名人的面上是像平時一般的過去。吃過夜飯，抽烟，離談；但是每一個動作都像被牽制似的。第二天我到敏姊臥室中誠意的剖白一切，我明知慧姊追逐着我，她爲了我費盡心機，可是我决不會投降到她身邊去的。我緊握了敏姊的手，想把我心中不能用言語表達的透示她。</p>
<p>她笑着丨不信任的微笑。</p>
<p>「姐姐，記得嗎？現在不是我們戀愛的時候丨」我將她的手握的更緊。</p>
<p>她慢慢的將手縮回，低着頭。</p>
<p>三天以後，敏姊的態度一如尋常了，有說，有笑。於是每個人的態度也改變過來，小黄招呼我的時候，一揮手，一點頭，蹣跚的擺出大塊頭將有的氣槪。他無憂無慮的時候，老學着哈哈的舉動。</p>
<p>慧姊没有來。看她們那天特别親熱的情形而發出了這類的變故，我很想向慧姊探個水落石出，然而她不來也是好的，我應該避免她，將這重疑案在各個人心中徴求自己的答案罷。</p>
<p>水面上被石子激蕩而波動着的漪漣，已漸漸的平穩，水面青澈的像鏡子一般恢復原態，不過那塊石子是永遠沉在河底了。一如世界大戰的秘幕一樣，總有行揭幕禮的一天。</p>
<p>這一天丨就在一個寒風怒吼着的早晨，我們在睡夢中被阿福抖顫的喊聲驚醒。</p>
<p>「李先生…孫…小姐…走了……兩輛黄包車……」</p>
<p>「什麽時候走的？」我睜開惺忪的眼，從床上跳起來。這回事好像久已在我預算中似的像這樣的迅雷不及掩耳，我也吃了一驚。</p>
<p>「半天了…噢…剛去：黄包車去的。」阿福像一匹剛御了重負的老馬一樣，接連的水氣衝出來，顯見這天寒冷的程度，「噢，有封信，給李先生的。」阿福接着說。</p>
<p>「黄包車到什麽地方聽見嗎？」我趿上拖鞋，披了襲外衣，接過阿福手中的信問他。</p>
<p>小黄聽了急忙從床上跳下來，竄到阿福跟前，推着他的身體喊：「快說，到那裏去的？快說，快說！」</p>
<p>「車子孫小姐自己喊的，她到廚房裏授給我這封信，我本奇怪孫小姐今天起身得道般早，跟她出來，她已跳上門前的黄包車走了。」</p>
<p>小黄回顧身來，注親到我手中的信！一封没有封口的信，我坐到床上，抽出一張洋紙，寫滿了潦草的鉛筆字。小黄慢慢走過來，重慶和笑風也呆着臉坐到我的床上，阿福也像被牽引似的走攏來，瞧着我手中的信紙；其實他除了認識自己名字之外，或者僅僅是「天地日月」之類了。然而他伸長了𩓐子，那樣熱心的瞧着。</p>
<p>看完信，我喟然倒身床上，信紙被小黄受了過去，他一字一句的看，幾乎停止了呼吸。</p>
<p>寒風從窗前吹過，屋内的四週被震動的格格的作響，我覺到一陣寒意從脚跟直往上透，舉起腿來，原來急忙中没有穿毛襪，將兩條腿凍得紅紅的。</p>

<p>— 西容</p>
<p>影界先進豐功偉績之一斑</p>
<p>六人之名垂諸史乘以不朽</p>
<p>（四）却利卓别麟　却利卓别麟係當代默劇中最偉大的一個人物，所以他的偉大就在能將劇情完全由動作表演出來。他臉上肌肉的靈動，他行路顚躓的狀態，他手的顫動，比一切的言語還要有效。他可以使人悲歡交作，一回兒流淚，一回兒笑。他的表演可以代表一個人生的經過。我們可以同情於他的錯誤，共享他的快樂，因爲他在銀幕上的做作，就是我們平日生活的一角。他的表演是超乎時代的，永遠眞切的。他並不屬於某一時間，某一地方，或某一時代。這位默默無聲的作家，有特别的天才，能將世界不幸的人們的不幸的遭遇描寫得維妙維肖。他使弱者的失敗，得著一種快慰，使之忘却痛苦與煩惱。因爲却利卓别麟能將幻想與事實調和在一起，他也就成爲一個不朽的天才藝術家了。</p>
<p>（五）瑪麗特蘭潄　她是普天下母性精華薈萃。她在衣著化妝的下層，她的健康，她的甜蜜，她偉大的靈魂，可以照耀得加同夜航之燈塔。她雖在銀幕上有偉大的成功，但若比之她個人更偉大的人格，那就渺乎其小了。而她一生的奮鬭，以至晚年的光榮，尤可使一般後進的藝術從業者，發生無窮的希望與鼓勵。許多人提起了瑪麗特蘭潄的名字，就可以聯想到人心裏面的一種柔愛。她成熟的人生哲理繪與她無窮的智慧，使她可以直達觀衆的内心。就是在她所謂强毅性質的表演中，她的慈愛亦無從禁止。其宣霖凡此種種，都是超乎表演的技巧的。再則瑪麗特蘭潄是當今美國號召力最大的一個演員，她亦是電影史上獨一無二的女演員，經過了多少年，而不喪失其明星之地位的。因爲她永久被美國全國的人所愛戴，所以她的地位，亦屬於不朽之列了。</p>
<p>（六）格雷泰嘉寳　這位瑞典大明星的所以能列席於不朽人物之儔，並不是由於關乎她的傳聞，或是製造的種種詭秘，而在她能引起觀衆們的嗜慾，同時又靳而不與，使之發生無窮的貪慕。她表現了一種實質的誘惑，但又因爲她精神上的拘禁，遏止了狎䁥接近的奢望。她偶然地飛到人間，但是瞬息又飛去了。她的地位，是其他電影演員所不能摩倣的。當然，她所具有的女子的個性，使她造成了一個風行一世的典型。因之她所得到的觀衆們的憶念，亦是永不泯滅的了。</p>
<p>當然，在以上所述的六個人之外，還有許多大明星，曾經有過巍巍的作品，轟動過全世界人的觀　，但是他們都不免時代的淘汰而於遲早之間，成爲已往的人物了。此外還有幾位屬於戲劇方面，而不專屬於影界的大人物。我們可以提起喬治亞理斯（ＧeorgeＡrliss），里昂巴里穆亞（ＬionelＢarrymore）和約翰巴里穆亞（ＪohnＢarrymore）三個人的名字。因爲他們不是完全在影界成功的，所以不與加入好萊塢不朽人物之列了。當然，此外還有多少可以附帶提起的名字，可惜不能一一加以陳述。（完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c266">評「凌霄壯志」 <a href="#c266" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e266" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">266</a></h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>ＮjuhtＦlight</p>
<p>米高梅出品丨大光明開映</p>
<p>以前一貫的注重於戀愛糾紛的美國影片，現在特突然的來一個没有很多戲做的很嚴的「凌霄壯志」，未嘗不使人感覺奇突。這對於陶醉於戀愛熱浪中的歡衆，未免掃興吧。</p>
<p>誰也會有此認識，在電影營業不景氣的情形之下，製片商人不得不以許多第一流的明星來極力號召。「大飯店」是如此，「八點鐘的晚餐」是如此「凌霄壯志」也是如此，的確，在觀衆們看着那末些鼎鼎大名的演員們，詎都會懷着絕大的希望而去鑒賞一次。</p>
<p>然而好演員也得有好的劇本，否則能夠做戯的明星們也没有方法盡量發展。加之大家擠在一道，在有限的膠片中，分配給每一個人的，不過是很少的一點。</p>
<p>「凌霄壯志」的劇作者，在創作的態度上，的確是非常莊嚴的，可是因着過於莊嚴，以致减輕了劇的興趣。當然我們决不反對電影的莊重性，不過對於不習慣的人們到底感覺生疏。</p>
<p>無論如何，這裏有着許多可取的特點。不誇張戀愛的夢幻，不迎合觀衆的低級興趣。它着重在故事的中心，很賢奏的正面的發展，完全没有苟且的態度，這是一般的劇作者不敢如此的。</p>
<p>有幾個主要演員，我們可於此片中看出他們與以前作品不同風度的痕迹。約翰巴里摩亞，以前常飾非常情感的角色，更兼有風流灑洒的姿態，情感的角色，如「棄夫」，「再度春風」，「陶白士敎授」，「大飯店」等片，此外如「魔愛」「拉斯蒲丁」等片，又有着一種神秘的力量。而在這一影片中，他却飾一個十分理智而盡力隱藏情感的人物，於此更足以證明他是一個天才演員，一個多方面的奇才。里昂巴里摩亞在此飾一個近於無賴的糊塗蟲似的角色，有着滿不在乎的神氣，也是以前少見的。他如常特高茂萊，也不像以前盡量活潑。至於漢倫海絲，克拉克蓋博，梅拉落漢利哥豋諸人，仍與以前的同一作風。</p>
<p>我們很覺得可惜，他們都没有充份做戲的機會，最可惜的是克拉克蓋博，祇能看到曲部的臉部，很少大動作。然而在很少的戯當中，他們都是十分細巧的逼眞熨貼。尤其是漢倫海絲在極少的場面中，能有如此成績，眞是可取。可以說没有誰不是在極力做戲。</p>
<p>一切的技巧，都是十分成熟，不管是照明，配音，佈景，却是毫不誇張，而保持着莊重的空氣。特别是飛機夜航雲層出巓的攝影，更是美極。</p>
<p>那末劇作者爲什麽要以飛機行爲背景呢？很明顯正這種題材還比較的新頴。因此關於航空或無線電的技術，也多少的介紹出來。自然這是科學的常識，對於淺見的觀衆，决非毫無裨益。</p>
<h3 id="c267">「熱趣」評 <a href="#c267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>— 摩爾</p>
<p>耶穌誕辰，雖則是歐美人的時節，但在歐美勢力盛大的上海，許多高等華人，同樣的在這天娛樂一下，而更廣大的小市民，又因爲所服務的地方，在這一天停工，就成羣的向電影院跑了。所以這一天每一個戲院都非常擁擠，而這點，是不能作爲否定經濟危機的理由的。</p>
<p>惠兩勒，何爾塞，是兩個最低級趣　的，同時又是最低能的演員；而「熱趣」的故事，同樣是無聊之極。以最低級趣味的演員，演無聊之極的故事，「熱趣」的價値是可想而知。在這裏，我們自然没有叙述它的故事的必要。</p>
<p>在舊小說「西游記」上，我們看到女兒國的故事，同時，「鏡花緣」中，也有同樣的叙述，「熱趣」也是這樣的故事。不過地點是衆所共知的菲洲，這個故事的完全空想，是不待言的。他的社會根據，除了用滿足人類的好奇心，以及發揮少數人的淫靡的幻想以外，是没有别的解釋。</p>
<p>編劇者將這故事，寫明發生在菲洲是有原因的，就是利用那地方天氣熱，因爲天氣熱，女人們可以少穿女服，因爲天氣熱，人的性格，就較爲浮動。同時天氣的熱，和人的戀愛熱，配合起來，方始成功道張「熱趣」。</p>
<p>導演者，抓緊了一個「熱」字寫，無論什麽地方，他總不忘了「熱」字。因此關於空氣方面，「熱趣」是得到了成功。其它實在找不出什麽優點來。</p>
<p>至於兩位主角的表演，那末，除了裝呆作痴以外，就没有什麽。即使永不燃着的雪茄烟，但是除了作個人的商標以外，我不知道有什麽作用。</p>
<p>倒是卡爾米老鼠，給觀衆相當的滿意！</p>
<h3 id="c268">好萊塢聖誕之準備 <a href="#c268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>

<p>一年一度的耶蘇聖誕節現在已快要到臨了，眼巴巴的盼望着耶蘇聖誕的來臨的，就是好萊塢的一批小强盜。他們雖然年紀很小，但是對於耶蘇聖誕却不會忘記的。</p>
<p>賈克古柏是最能辦事的孩子。他在耶蘇聖誕之前三十日就要去預備。因爲他在那天送出去的禮物是很多的，如果不早一些預備，那時一定要來不及了。</p>
<p>倍倍可當代比較買克古柏略遲些，但是當耶蘇聖誕之前二十五日的光景亦已在預備他的禮品了，他的禮品之中，要算送給他父親和母親的最貴重，大約至少亦須數百元美金以上。</p>
<p>小孩子們的興致是如此，許多年紀老的明星們亦不减於小孩子。他們每一年到耶蘇聖誕日，好像是偷來的日子，非狂烈的去鬧一番是不行的，並且他們所送的禮物亦很别緻。卓别麟有一次送每一個朋友一雙破皮鞋。這雙破皮鞋有眞的一樣大，好像他自己在影片上穿的破皮鞋一樣，但是原料是巧可力所做的，珍妮蓋諾有一次送給每個朋友一部書，這部書的外觀好像是有數百頁的眞書一樣，但是裏面一共祗有二頁，第一頁是送者和受者的姓名，第二頁是慶祝聖誕及新年的一首詩，而這本書亦是糖所做成的，外面的書套恰巧是一隻盒子，今年這許多明星不知道又在想什麽新法子了。</p>

<p>一九三三年，的確可說是個電影的年頭。不但幾個資本雄厚的大公司拚命地製造了許多新片，就是許多資本薄弱人材缺乏的小公司，也努力地生産了不少的趕上時代的作品。</p>
<p>最近小公司中的天北公司，在長期的奮鬥中，趕製了一部愛的歸宿的新片，今天在北京大戲院開映。</p>
<p>這是，是指示一個受現社會舊婚姻制度束縛的弱女怎樣反抗她的環境，怎樣自食其力的生活，結果在虛僞欺騙之下，造成了一部資本主義制度下的忠愛的悲劇。</p>

<p>— 田夫</p>
<p>這時候老趙却正在買辦公館的墻外徘徊。偷食的老鼠在誘惑着他的心，饑餓在壯着他的胆：他終於影子似的閃進買辦公館去。這以後不久，倦游歸來的太太已經倚在青年的懷裡被汽車送回公館，預備開始人尋她的好夢。</p>
<p>（七）賊</p>
<p>買辦太太有點兒慵倦，需要安息了；却不見了一件睡衣。找，找不到；她在地下發見了泥濘的脚印。於是，房子裏起了小小的騷亂。太太嗔怒着怪買辦不好，翻首飾箱看失去了什麽；買辦睡眼惺忪地起了床，責篤女僕不管事；老陳的老婆站在旁邊發楞，滿臉是驚慌的表情………太太打電話到巡捕房，接着巡捕房就派副了偵探。</p>
<p>「一件睡衣，一只鑲着寳石的别針。是昨晚二點鐘以後失竊的。」買辦太太告訴偵探。偵探就去察看地下那哈吧狗兒正中嗅着的脚印。再問着太太：「除了僕人，近幾天可有别的可疑的人到這兒來過？」</p>
<p>太太想着，她的眼睛忽然發火的釘着陳媽，要用眼光一刻子把她釘死似的。「對啦，一定和她有關係！」太太對偵探說，指點着陳媽：「昨天傍晚，她的男人在門房裡和她鬼鬼崇崇地談話。於是偵探帶着陳媽：「到行裏去講話」了。</p>
<p>到行裡去：講話」雖然由你；信不信可是他們的主意。你說没偷東西嗎？他說混賬，你做了賊還敢抵賴！反正窮人都不是好東西，要關起來治一治：這是規矩！丨老陳昨晚跟老婆在周公館的門房裡說話是眞的，這就是十分之十的重大嫌疑，於是陳媽被脅迫着帶他們到小菜場裡，把老陳抓了。「到行裡去」，關起來治一治。</p>
<p>（八）太陽底下的秘密</p>
<p>是早晨七八點鐘的時候，太陽光又朗朗地照着這熱鬧的都市了。據說一切秘密的行動或犯罪的事情，都是在黑暗中進行的。在這裡我們却要介紹一點太陽底下大白天裡的秘密。老趙作賊當然是犯罪的事情。說也奇怪，老趙對自己的犯罪雖然不免自己慚愧，可也有點兒高興。「犯罪」的人原是因爲「受罪」受得太多了才去犯的，窮人在走投無路當中，往往祗有「犯罪」才可以救自己的性命。老趙窮困到這個樣子，犯了一次罪却使他精神也活潑了許多。早上第一件工作自然是上當舖把睡衣和别針換了錢。家裡有餓着肚子的人在着，要錢的信不知來過幾多封了；現在得滙個三五塊錢回去：這就上郵局。肚子裏的恐慌得解决。還有呢？哦！陳大的弟弟太可憐了，受了傷没錢請醫生；窮人的苦是祗有窮人能了解的，他老趙旣然有錢不帮助一下嗎？手頭還剩有兩塊錢，他就把這兩塊錢請了個醫生給老陳的弟弟診治去……（未完）</p>

<p>Left Route Unsuccessful, Focus Shifts to Central Route</p>
<p>Shouning Bandits Lead Attack on Qingyuan</p>
<p>No Change in Front Lines in Northern Fujian</p>
<p>(Hangzhou) The Aviation Office dispatched planes for reconnaissance today and reported that there were no changes in the front lines in Northern Fujian. There was still contact at Qing'ai and Huangsha Passes, forty miles south of Taishun. The main Fujian force is still attacking Taishun. Bandits from Shouning are leading the attack on Qingyuan. (Special dispatch from the 24th)</p>
<p>(Hangzhou) Since the start of the major battle south of Pucheng, the main forces of both sides have made contact. Central elite troops are being successively sent to reinforce, and morale is high. Due to inconvenient transportation and difficulty in supplying military provisions, the enemy is showing signs of collapse. Our army has an absolute advantage. (Special dispatch from the 24th)</p>
<p>(Hangzhou) Because the Fujian forces' attack on Zhejiang via the left route was unsuccessful, they are focusing on the central route, concentrating their forces to attack Taishun from Shouning and Qingyuan from Zhenghe. Shouning is only twenty miles from Taishun, and Zhenghe is no more than five miles from Qingyuan. The main forces are gradually approaching, and a major battle is about to begin.

<p>(Hangzhou) The Zhejiang Security Office received a telegram from Li Wenkai, the magistrate of Changshan County, today, stating that on the afternoon of the 22nd, more than 2,000 Red bandits attacked Qiuchuan Town. He immediately led the core team to increase defense, and after fierce fighting until the morning of the 23rd, hundreds of bandits were killed. The rest fled towards Nuanshui in Dexing, Jiangxi.

<p>(Hangzhou) Provincial authorities received a telegram from Taishun and Pingyang today stating that Fujian troops from Fuzhou are moving towards Ningde in northern Fujian. Many Fujian troops have arrived in Pingnan. The 19th Route Army troops in plain clothes within Taishun territory have all retreated to Shouning County. (Special dispatch from the 24th)</p>

<p>(Hangzhou) Chen Shizheng, Director of the 4th Branch of the Zhejiang Security Office, went to the province to pay respects to Yu Jishi and discuss defense matters in Wenzhou and Chuzhou. He returned to his post today. According to reports, he will inspect Taishun and Qingyuan. The plainclothes troops discovered in these two counties have been completely repelled.

<h3 id="e6">Chen Shaokuan's Departure Still Pending <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Chen Shaokuan said that the naval organs directly under the jurisdiction of the Navy in Mawei (i.e., Ma Jiang) and Changle, numbering fourteen, were forcibly occupied by the Fujian side a month ago, and they raised a false flag, enduring the pain temporarily. Recently, as the central army has gathered in large numbers and the army, navy and air force have moved out at the same time, their base has been shaken. The puppet troops stationed in Mawei first fled, and Li Mengbin, the commander of the Ma Jiang fortress, led warships to recover it on the 23rd. From the morning of the 24th, the organs there (except for the naval school, which has already moved to Nanjing for classes) resumed operations, and the flag of the Party and the country was once again seen in Ma Jiang. The naval organs in Xiamen are still operating as usual, and the market is more stable than before. Central troops are deployed everywhere on warships, and security is extremely tight. Deputy Minister Li Shijia went to Shanghai to discuss important matters and has not yet returned to Nanjing. The steps for the Navy's inspection have been roughly finalized. The matter concerns military secrets and does not need to be stated clearly. However, my departure is still pending because there are important administrative matters that need to be urgently sorted out. There is currently no need to go in person. Perhaps the commander of the First Fleet, Chen Jiliang, will be sent first in the next few days to direct the entire army. The departure date for the entire army has not yet been decided. The coastal defenses of Wenzhou are solid, and outside rumors are absolutely not accurate. Outside rumors that puppet troops changed their target to Wenzhou in eastern Zhejiang, loaded on a ship and sailed to Wenzhou, and were attacked by the central navy, etc. I have not received any telegrams about this matter. All warships of our army are equipped with wireless radios and report at any time. If this happened, a detailed telegram would have been reported, which shows that this statement is not credible.

<p>Handling Border Affairs and Observing Military Parade</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Li Zongren left Yong on the 21st for Hanoi, Vietnam. There are many rumors circulating outside. It is reported that Vietnam and Guangxi are adjacent. France built a railway from Hanoi to Longzhou. Therefore, border trade between Vietnam and Guangxi is frequent, and disputes often occur. Li's visit to Vietnam is to negotiate such disputes, and it is also a goodwill visit. He will also take the opportunity to observe the Vietnamese military parade and sports meeting in Hanoi. There are no other missions. He will return to Guangxi within a few days. (Special dispatch from the 24th)</p>

<h3 id="e10">Most Impeachment Cases by the Control Yuan Have Been Delayed <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>The Control Yuan Advocates Revising the Disciplinary Law</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to the Control Yuan, there are still over ninety cases of impeachment proposals submitted for disciplinary action in the past three years that have not yet been executed. The reasons for non-execution by the Disciplinary Committee are mostly due to: A) The accused person has not yet been given the opportunity to defend himself; B) The case is still under investigation. However, there is no definite deadline for the defense or the completion of the investigation. In disciplinary cases involving criminal matters, the Disciplinary Committee currently refers them to the courts for trial. However, according to the current disciplinary law, only dismissal, demotion, salary deduction, demerit, and reprimand are stipulated, and there is no provision for other measures. Recently, the Control Yuan has required that all impeachment cases be thoroughly investigated by officials appointed by the President of the Yuan and reviewed by Control Committee members before being impeached. This can be said to be rigorous and comprehensive. However, after the case is transferred to the Disciplinary Committee, the Disciplinary Committee again sends officials or entrusts local governments to investigate. This has a great impact on the time and the facts of the case. For example, if a certain area is planting opium and has been impeached, by the time the Disciplinary Committee sends officials to investigate and complete the investigation, the opium harvest season will have passed, and there will be no evidence to prove it. The Control Yuan will send a letter to the Administrative Legal Regulations Reorganization Committee to propose amendments to the above points. (Special dispatch from the 24th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Huang Shaoxiong invited the representatives of Inner Mongolia, Zhao Taibao and others, on the morning of the 24th to further discuss the principles of the autonomous region of Mongolia and the organizational law of the regional government. Zhang first stated that the central government has accepted in principle the eleven suggestions signed by the princes and nobles of Inner Mongolia and will submit them to the Central Political Committee for discussion and approval this week, and then the Executive Yuan will formally decide. However, regarding the issue of the autonomous region, such as the old territories of the twelve banners of Chahar, which have already been included in the scope of the Chahar Special Region, are still under the jurisdiction of the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region Government. The central government is carefully considering this. The organizational law of the regional government must also be approved by the Legislative Yuan to be legal. If the representatives cannot wait for long, then one side will first establish an autonomous preparatory committee, and the other side will be discussed by the Legislative Yuan. The representatives stated: 1. After the Central Political Committee approves the principle of Inner Mongolian autonomy, should the representatives return to Mongolia first, or wait for the preparatory committee of the autonomous region until the ten representatives of the twelve banners of Chahar arrive in Nanjing to discuss and then decide. 2. The biggest issue in this Inner Mongolian request for autonomy is that the old Inner Mongolian territories of the Chahar and Suiyuan special districts must be included in the autonomous region. If the above two districts are still under the jurisdiction of Chahar and Suiyuan, then the scope of Inner Mongolian autonomy will only extend to the barren deserts, which is not the original intention of the representatives' request. 3. Members of the Autonomous Preparatory Committee will be elected by both the Mongolian princes and nobles and the people, but the preparation period will be limited to one month, and the time should not be too long.

<p>(Nanjing) The Control Yuan believes that the Central Government has stipulated that the land tax surcharge shall not exceed 59%, and the government has issued an order to all provinces that any increase in surcharges that has not been reviewed by the Legislative Yuan cannot be increased without authorization.

The matter is now being submitted to the Yuan's affairs meeting for discussion, and it has been decided that the members of the Control Committee, Yang Tianji, Yang Lianggong, and others, will review the matter separately and record in detail the exact amount of surcharges in each province.

<h3 id="e28">The Opportunity to Resolve the Kham-Tibet Dispute <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>— Shu</p>
<p>Since the sudden death of the Dalai Lama in Tibet, an opportunity has arisen to resolve the Kham-Tibet dispute. If the central government handles this matter properly this time, the long-standing, crisis-ridden situation in Tibet can be brought to stability, and the western border can gradually become more secure.</p>
<p>The origin of the Tibetan problem lies in Zhao Erfeng's harsh and severe rule over the Tibetan people during the late Qing dynasty. Although the Tibetans were intimidated by military force and dared not revolt immediately, neighboring powers were watching for opportunities, and the local people were contemplating rebellion. After Zhao's departure, the Tibetan border gradually changed. Since the beginning of the Republic, it has implicitly formed a separate political system. However, the Panchen Erdeni, who was stationed in Rear Tibet, was deeply influenced by Tao Rong of the former Qing dynasty. Since the Republic, his inclination towards the interior has never changed, conflicting with the Dalai Lama's pro-British policy. Moreover, the Panchen was focused on his spiritual practice and detached from politics, so the power fell into the hands of the Dalai Lama, and the Panchen had no choice but to travel far to China. Recently, the Dalai Lama seemed to have realized the mistakes of his past pro-British policy and expressed his intention to return to the central government. Therefore, there should be no major problem with the Panchen returning to Tibet after the Dalai Lama's death. However, according to the news reports, the Panchen is still under consideration.</p>
<p>At this time, when the Dalai Lama has passed away and the Panchen has not yet returned, there is a vacuum of power. The Tibetan people mostly follow religious guidance, and the Tibetan region is a region where politics and religion are inseparable. It is natural that people's hearts are unsettled. In addition, India, the treasure house of England, is a neighbor to the south. It has long been making arrangements and clearly harbors the ambition to seize the opportunity for annexation. Only if the Xikang Province, which is adjacent to Tibet, can govern diligently and make the Tibetans feel impressed, and the Han people can secure their livelihoods, no matter how cunning the neighboring powers are, Tibet will not suddenly deviate from the mainland. Now, if we try to examine the internal affairs of Sichuan Province, we can see that under the current situation of separatism, the warlords only know how to defend their own territories and how to plunder their wealth. They have never paid attention to the overall situation in Sichuan, let alone national defense or care about Tibet. Moreover, the troops stationed in the Kangding area lack knowledge and even basic military discipline. They put on airs and show off their power to ordinary Han people, let alone the Tibetan people. Therefore, the resentment between the stationed troops and the local people is growing deeper, and it is difficult for the law to be impartial, so the motivation for rebellion is brewing. Zhao Erfeng's strict measures may have been effective for a time in a unified era. A single brigade may have been enough to govern both Front and Rear Tibet. But now, times have changed. The Tibetans are no longer as easily manipulated as before. In terms of military affairs, they also have modern firearms to fight against the Sichuan army. In terms of knowledge, they have gradually understood politics. The old muddleheaded policies can no longer withstand the gentle deception of others. The central government is far away, and transportation is difficult, so it is beyond its reach. Fortunately, the leader of the pro-British faction is now unable to continue his policies, and the Panchen Lama, who inclines towards the interior, is about to return to Tibet to preside over religious affairs and reorganize the administration. The opportunity to resolve the Kham-Tibet dispute may lie here.</p>
<p>At this time of transition from the old to the new, when the situation is changing, the central government should plan carefully and send senior officials to Tibet to appease the people. In addition to assisting the Panchen's return to Tibet, we should also pay attention to the following points in order to win over the hearts of the Tibetan people and consolidate the national defense of the border region.</p>
<p>First, the key to governing Tibet is to stabilize Sichuan first. Sichuan is Tibet's close neighbor. Although Xikang has been designated as a province, it is still practically a dependency of Sichuan Province. All the negative political influences of Sichuan inevitably affect Xikang, and the corruption of Xikang is easily despised by the Tibetans. Therefore, reorganizing Sichuan is crucial to governing Tibet. Moreover, the people of Sichuan are eager for good governance. As long as the central government has concrete measures and deals with the situation cautiously and resolutely, stabilizing Sichuan will not be difficult.</p>
<p>Second, governing Tibet should involve special policies. Tibet has been influenced by Yellow Buddhism for more than five hundred years, from the Ming dynasty to the present. It has almost become a second nature to them. Its general economic form is also in the early stages of agricultural economy. In addition, it is surrounded by high mountains, and there are few opportunities to absorb knowledge. Now, Inner Mongolia has been granted autonomy. Why can't Tibet also try to implement autonomy suitable to local needs under the guidance of the central government, so that the Tibetan people can have religious freedom and achieve political stability?</p>
<p>Third, pay attention to the diplomacy with the two major neighboring countries to the north and south. Whether it is England or the Soviet Union, both are focusing their attention on Xinjiang and Tibet. Now that the Xinjiang coup has not yet subsided, the Tibetan problem must be re-sorted out. We should renew our diplomatic approach with the neighboring countries that have already set foot in Xinjiang and Tibet. Not only must the borders be clear, but the political relations must also be clearly defined. We must ensure that the northwestern border defense does not repeat the mistakes of the past.</p>

<p>Genoa, Italy - British Foreign Secretary Simon and his wife, having departed from Paris yesterday, arrived here at 10:00 AM this morning. After a light meal, they were scheduled to fly by seaplane to Capri at 11:00 AM to spend Christmas. (Havas, December 24)</p>
<p>(Paris) - British Foreign Secretary Simon left here on Saturday afternoon for Genoa. On Sunday, he will fly to Capri. According to the preliminary schedule, Simon will arrive in Rome, Italy on January 1 to meet with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini to discuss disarmament and the future of the League of Nations. The purpose of Simon's trip is to gather the opinions of various governments and then decide on England's policy. As for the results of Simon's talks with Poncet on Friday, French newspapers have varying expectations. However, it seems that Simon has persuaded France to slightly change its attitude towards Germany in two respects. First, the French government has decided not to publicly announce the details of the Franco-German negotiations for the time being. Second, France had drafted a note consistent with Germany's stance, but the French Foreign Ministry has now decided to postpone its delivery. The content of the draft note is to reject the German proposal. Furthermore, while British Foreign Secretary Simon was here, French Minister of War Daladier did not attend any banquets, which has led to many rumors that Daladier was deliberately avoiding meeting with Simon.

<p>(Paris) - Foreign Minister Poncet's formal visits to Warsaw and Prague are unlikely to take place before February of next year, as Poncet will need to attend the reopening of Congress on January 9 to participate in debates on diplomatic issues. On January 15, he must go to Geneva to attend the Council of the League of Nations, and on January 21, he must attend the meeting of the Bureau of the Disarmament Conference. For these reasons, Poncet's trip to Poland and Czechoslovakia will be delayed until February. Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu has accepted the formal invitation from the French government and is expected to come to Paris at the end of January. It is also rumored that King Carol of Romania may come to France at the same time, which is not impossible. According to general speculation, Yugoslav Foreign Minister Jevtić will also be formally invited by France to come to Paris to meet with French authorities, and King Alexander of Yugoslavia may also visit Paris.

<p>180 Dead, Over 200 Injured</p>
<p>Holiday Excursion Leads to Unexpected Disaster</p>
<p>Dismembered Limbs and Broken Legs Everywhere</p>
<p>(Paris) - An unprecedented tragedy occurred today in Pomponne near Lagny, France, where an express train between Paris and Strasbourg collided with an express train between Chalons and Troyes. At least 165 people have died, and over 300 are injured. As of 7:00 PM tonight, 165 bodies have been recovered from the wrecked trains, and it is expected that more will be found. At 5:00 PM tonight, the undamaged portion of the Strasbourg express train arrived in Paris, carrying 131 bodies and hundreds of injured. It is reported that almost all passengers on both trains were injured. Even more tragic is that some bodies were still clutching their Christmas food packages. Both trains were full of people on Christmas holiday excursions, and two members of parliament were also among the dead. According to official reports, the accident was caused by the Paris-Strasbourg express train crashing into the rear of the Chalons-Troyes express train. The total number of deaths is estimated to be between 170 and 175. (National News, December 24)</p>
<p>(Paris) - Yesterday evening at 7:00 PM, the special express train between Paris and Strasbourg and the express train between Paris and Nancy collided in Lagny, about 25 kilometers from here. Approximately 180 people were killed and over 200 injured, making it the most tragic train accident of the 20th century. The cause of the accident was the cold weather, ice, dense fog, and poor visibility. The events unfolded as follows: The Paris-Nancy express train, upon reaching about 2 kilometers from the town of Lagny, stopped due to the fog, occupying the track. It lit signals and set off firecrackers to warn oncoming trains. Unfortunately, the Paris-Strasbourg special express train, failing to hear the firecrackers or see the signals, continued at a speed of 100 kilometers per hour and crashed into the last carriage of the express train, smashing it to pieces, and continued forward at the same speed, destroying six passenger carriages in succession. The wreckage was scattered with corpses, a horrifying scene. The sounds of moans never ceased. It was evening, making the scene even more tragic. Rescuers came with lights, moving corpses. Dismembered limbs and broken legs were everywhere. The Paris fire brigade rushed to participate in the rescue. The bishop of Meaux, wearing black mourning clothes, prayed for the dead, tears in his eyes. Premier Chautemps, who was participating in the discussion of the financial bill in the National Assembly until 2:00 AM, heard the news and immediately went to the station with Budget Minister Marchandeau and Minister of Public Works Paganon and took a train to the scene of the accident to investigate and offer condolences. The driver and mechanic of the crashed express train have been arrested and are awaiting trial. Marne Deputy and former Minister of Commerce Roland was severely injured. Also, another train was approaching from the opposite direction at the time of the accident. Fortunately, the driver sensed something unusual and braked urgently, stopping completely 100 meters from the accident site, otherwise the tragedy would have been even more unimaginable. (Havas, December 24)</p>
<p>(Paris) - The baggage room of the Gare de l'Est this morning has been transformed into a morgue, with the corpses arranged outside the iron fence awaiting collection. The first to be prepared for burial was former Minister of Commerce Roland, whose corpse was smashed to pieces, with a gaping hole in his abdomen, a ghastly sight. According to the latest official news, the total number of deaths is 185, including prominent figures such as former Undersecretary Morel, former Minister of Commerce Roland, and Senator Hachette. Premier Chautemps, Chairman of the Paris Municipal Council Fegay, and Police Commissioner Chiappe have all come to pay their respects to the victims.

<p>Policy of Purchasing Gold Abroad Has Little Effect</p>
<p>Industries Flourishing After England and America Abandon the Gold Standard</p>
<p>(New York) - According to information obtained by the New York Evening Post's Washington correspondent, the US government will soon abandon its policy of buying gold abroad. This policy was originally proposed by Professor Warren, an advisor to President Roosevelt, as a way to raise domestic raw material prices. However, since its implementation two months ago, domestic prices have only risen from 71.5 to 72, with very little effect. Yesterday, the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks and the members of the Board of Governors held a secret meeting. The result was reportedly to abandon the policy of buying gold. It is also rumored that the government is now planning to adopt new methods to raise prices. According to some sources, President Roosevelt is currently studying a plan that can reconcile the bimetallic system and the theory of "commodity currency." (Havas, December 24)</p>
<p>(Washington) - US House Speaker Rainey stated today that the US government's silver plan may not significantly increase silver prices, but the President's concern for silver is enough to encourage people. He still advocates adopting a bimetallic system, rapidly purchasing silver, and issuing silver certificates that can be exchanged for gold, which would have an effect on restoring 1926 prices that no other plan can achieve. Furthermore, issuing such certificates would eliminate the need to maintain the gold-silver ratio. (National News, December 23)</p>

<p>(Berlin) - The death sentence of Lubbe, the defendant in the Reichstag fire case, cannot be changed by other courts. Only President Hindenburg has the power to pardon him. Therefore, the execution will be temporarily postponed until an appeal is made to the President for a pardon. According to German emergency law, those who commit treason must be hanged. (National News, December 24)</p>
<p>(London) - Lubbe, the defendant in the German Reichstag fire case, has been sentenced to death, and the others have been acquitted. The newspapers published here on Sunday expressed satisfaction with this verdict, while also expressing concern. The Conservative Sunday Times, although believing that the case was a major political mistake from beginning to end, thought that the greatest mistake had been avoided, which was fortunate. This view of the newspaper does not mean that the case has been concluded or that the truth has been revealed. This can be seen from the following statement in the newspaper: "Unless he is pardoned, Lubbe will die. But there are many doubts as to whether Lubbe was the mastermind of the conspiracy." The Sunday Observer's view on this matter is even more obvious, stating that Lubbe is actually taking the blame for others. The newspaper also went to great lengths to explain why people generally say that "the Reichstag fire was deliberately set by the Nazi Party." (Havas, December 23)</p>

In order to adjust diplomatic relations with the countries of North and South America, a new bureau will be established specifically. The Bureau of the Americas will be divided into two sections: The first section will handle political and diplomatic relations, and the second section will protect, supervise, encourage, and handle trade relations with Japanese immigrants in North and South America and with the countries of Central and South America.</p>
<p>2.  Establishment of the Bureau of Europe and Asia: Due to the separation of the Bureau of the Americas, the current Bureau of Europe and America will be renamed the Bureau of Europe and Asia, with three sections: The first section will handle diplomatic relations with Soviet Russia and the countries of the Near East. The second section will handle diplomatic issues with Europe, Africa, and the South Pacific.

<h3 id="e45">Japan's Military and Economic Aggression in Manchuria and Mongolia Progresses Simultaneously <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>New Security Organizations Established by the Army and Navy</p>
<p>Decision to Carry Out Economic Aggression</p>
<p>(Changchun) - Since this spring, the Kwantung Army has intensified its aggression in Manchuria, advancing simultaneously along military and economic paths. The main military activities are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The Naval Department Stationed in Manchuria: The Japanese Navy Ministry established the Naval Department Stationed in Manchuria in Changchun on April 1, with Rear Admiral Hayashi as commander, to guard the coasts and rivers of the puppet state. The puppet state's naval fleet and river defense fleet are under its command.</p>
<p>(2) The Port of Lushun: On April 19, the Navy Ministry also established the Port of Lushun, renovated the Lushun Fortress, and placed the Second Overseas Fleet under the command of its commander, with Rear Admiral Tsuda as its commander.</p>
<p>(3) Establishment of Two New Garrison Units: In order to guard the newly seized Chinese railways and the Russian-Manchurian border, the Japanese Army Ministry appointed Lieutenant Generals Takeda and Sato as commanders, respectively, deciding to station them permanently in Manchuria and Mongolia.</p>
<p>While the Japanese militarists are intensifying their military activities, they have also decided on an economic aggression plan, defining the steps to seize rights and interests. The main activities are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Unauthorized Reorganization of the Administrative Organization of Jiandao: There are many Japanese-Koreans in the four eastern counties of the Eastern Border Region, accounting for 80% of all Koreans in Manchuria. In March of this year, this region was designated as a special administrative region, and its administrative and police chiefs are uniformly appointed by the Governor-General of Korea.</p>
<p>(2) Self-Defined Commercial Lease Rights Regulations: On February 6, the Kwantung Army self-defined three articles of commercial lease rights regulations, officially announced them, and ordered the county magistrates of the four provinces to follow them.</p>
<p>(3) New Agreement on Japanese-Manchurian Communications: On March 26 of this year, Commander Mutō and the puppet state's foreign minister signed the Japanese-Manchurian Communications Agreement, making all telecommunications and telephone communications businesses under the management of the Japanese.</p>
<p>(4) Self-Defined Outline for Industrial Development: The Kwantung Army self-defined the Outline for Industrial Development of Manchuria and Mongolia and, starting on August 15, held a meeting of Japanese and Manchurian industrialists in Dalian, announcing its policy of monopolizing the industries of Manchuria and Mongolia. 113 representatives from various Japanese business circles attended the meeting, the content of which is omitted.</p>
<p>(5) Establishment of the East Asia Industrial Association: In order to promote Japanese capitalists to go to Manchuria to develop industries, the East Asia Industrial Association was established in Dalian in August of this year. The puppet state bore 500,000 yuan, the South Manchuria Railway Company bore 500,000 yuan, and the Bank of Korea bore 200,000 yuan, totaling 1.2 million yuan. Jitsusami is the chairman, and Zheng Ni is the nominal president. (China United News Agency)</p>
<p>(6) Japan-Manchuria Industrial Association: Japan has also established the Japan-Manchuria Industrial Association in Japan, with Yūki Toyotarō, president of the Industrial Bank of Japan, as chairman. The purpose of this organization is to facilitate investment in Manchuria, mediate disputes between Japanese and Manchurian capitalists, and investigate industrial data in Manchuria and Mongolia.</p>
<p>The Japanese militarists are so actively plotting against us, but still think it is not enough. They plan to reorganize the South Manchuria Railway Company under the control of the militarists and prepare to invade Russia again. This is the main activity of the Japanese militarists in Manchuria in one year. (China United News Agency)</p>

<p>This Year's Tests Concluded</p>
<p>Significant Progress Achieved</p>
<p>▲Moscow News: The Soviet Red Army conducted a nationwide inspection of the combat readiness of major divisions at the end of September this year, commemorating the 15th anniversary of its establishment. According to a commentary in "Red Star," the central organ of the Revolutionary Military Soviet, the main points of the inspection results are as follows: The results of testing the combat capabilities of various units of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army show that the political and cultural activities of most divisions, soldiers, and commanders, as well as their technical skills and mastery of all types of weapons, have achieved significant success. The most notable aspects are the shooting and tactical departments, and the increase in political education. Particularly noteworthy is the uniformity of training and performance across entire divisions and even entire corps. For example, the 80th Rifle Division achieved average scores of 238.150%, 239.150%, and 240.150% across all regiments and all types of firearms. The results of this year's inspection show that it is particularly gratifying not only in terms of all aspects of weapons readiness for war, but also in the political education of individual soldiers, which shows better results than before. The improvement in political education is the result of the integration of tactical and political education by the Party organizations and political organizations within the army. (World Press)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Member of the Central Executive Committee, Zhu Jiqing, plans to propose a "Reclamation to Save the Nation" proposal at the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee. The draft has now been completed with the help of experts and is being circulated for endorsement by other members of the Central Executive Committee. Zhu also plans to invite agricultural and water conservancy experts to personally investigate the Wuyuan Hetao area after the meeting. According to Zhu, his "Reclamation to Save the Nation" proposal differs from the general slogan of developing the Northwest. Its purpose is to prepare for the recovery of the Northeast. He stated that during his service in the Northeast, he deeply understood that the people of the Northeast are rich in national character and are by no means easily conquered by violence. However, in recent years, the families and fields of the Northeast Patriotic Volunteer Army have been mostly confiscated. After entering the customs, they have scattered to various places, but their national spirit has not been extinguished. Therefore, Zhu believes that maintaining the national spirit to recover lost territories is currently the most important task. Furthermore, allocating funds to relieve Northeast refugees must start from the aspect of production, not merely providing consumption as sufficient. If this can be done, they can all be self-sufficient in three to five years, without relying on government relief, and can also survive. This is why Zhu advocates establishing a settlement plan to accommodate the families and refugees of the Patriotic Volunteer Army, allowing the flowers of the nation to bloom on the Northwest plains. This move will be beneficial and without harm to the Northwest. Zhu will work hard to make it a reality after arriving in Beijing. (Central News Agency telegram, 24th)</p>

She once asked to take it for a few days to enjoy, and it has now been returned to the original owner. Street talks and alleys discussed it, calling it auspicious, which caused a sensation for a time. According to Zhu's house, the origin of the grass is roughly as follows: Zhu Dikun's eldest son, Xianzhang, is currently 18 years old and is still studying. After the Mid-Autumn Festival, Zhu Xianzhang and three or four classmates went to Mount Qianfo south of the city to visit. They strolled through the peaks and reached the west side of the mountain, where there was a thousand-foot-high cliff, with an ancient cypress tree below, which could be counted in circles, reaching five feet in height. The branches and trunks reached the sky, and it was a century-old object. Zhu looked far away and occasionally saw a colorful butterfly. He rushed forward to catch it, touched it, and it turned into a strange grass, of unknown name. Because of its strangeness, he took it home and carefully studied it. Its texture is as hard as stone, but it is extremely light. Other kinds of grass can pass through its head and be attached to it to grow. The next day, Zhu's family members went to the original discovery site with hoes to search for its roots, but they found only mixed soil and stones and nothing else. After the news spread, the threshold of those who went to see it every day was almost broken. Some people said that the Lingzhi recorded in the Flora was quite similar to this. As for the shape of the grass, it is roughly the same as a mushroom, but its texture is not a mushroom. It is about four inches high, with a stem, shaped like an old man's neck, with wrinkles and spots, and like a dead tree. The top gradually widens, shaped like a fan, and spreads forward. There is a white membrane underneath, which gradually shrinks, with fragrant grass and Hushan green grass passing through it. There are only whisker marks. It is as light as nothing when held, and makes a clang when knocked, like striking a stone chime. Soft green grass can be pierced through it. The color is black and red, close to deep purple. According to Zhu Dikun, its color changes monthly, from red to purple, and then from purple to red, endlessly circulating. It is suspected to be meat Ganoderma, a discovery that has not occurred for thousands of years. If you look at it with a magnifying glass, there are phenomena such as lions and Buddhas on it. It is indeed a strange thing. (22nd)</p>

<h3 id="e82">After the Japanese Government's Budget for the Next Fiscal Year is Finalized (Tokyo, Japan) <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>The Crisis Has Not Diminished</p>
<p>Political Upheaval is Still Brewing</p>
<p>The Military is Highly Alert</p>
<p>Public Dissatisfaction is High</p>
<p>Since the military proposed a state of emergency, which has enveloped the entire country of Japan, parliamentary politics have been paralyzed, and the military has indeed made progress. The arrogance of the military has forced those engaged in political work to become mere tools of the military. However, we know that the Saitō Cabinet was originally intended to be a cabinet to weather the so-called state of emergency. Therefore, the composition of the cabinet included many representatives of capital conglomerates. Even if cabinet members from political parties lean towards the military, they are by no means willing to easily abandon the interests of capitalists. As a result, financial problems arose because the budget was excessively expanded.</p>
<p>Among these problems, the first is the opposition between the Army and the Ministry of Finance, and the second is the opposition between the Navy and the Ministry of Finance. To put it bluntly, it is the opposition between the military and financial cliques. Under normal circumstances, since the Saitō Cabinet contained such huge contradictions, the cabinet would inevitably collapse, or the military would emerge to lead the formation of a cabinet, or the financial clique would rise up to become a financial oligarchy. However, none of these things actually happened because the military did not dare to risk causing domestic unrest, and the financial clique did not have the strength to suppress the military. Therefore, they finally managed to find a temporary way to ease the situation. The budget proposed by the Army has indeed been greatly reduced, and the Navy's so-called second supplementary plan, the renovation of battleships, and the establishment of air wings are said to be indispensable. The Saitō Cabinet was almost unable to maintain itself because of this, but in the end, it was still a compromise. At the beginning of this month, the number of expenditures for the next fiscal year decided by the cabinet was 2.11 billion yen, a decrease of over 128 million yen compared to this year's 2.239 billion yen. Then, isn't the so-called budget expansion incorrect? It is not known that there is a reason for this, which is that the new special accounting will be separated independently from next year. The special accounting belonging to the communication industry has 190 million yen, which is calculated separately. If this amount is added to the budget, the budget for the next fiscal year will be 62 million yen more than this year. The total amount of expenditures will be 2.3 billion yen, an unprecedentedly huge figure.</p>
<p>If we compare it with the situation three years ago, the expenditure budget in 1931 was only 1.488 billion yen. In these three years, it has jumped by 800 million yen, what a huge change in finance! Let's take a look at the newly increased content in terms of expenditures. The total of regular expenses and temporary expenses is 723 million yen. Among this huge increase, the increased interest on public bonds and the repayment of foreign debts, and the losses due to the depreciation of the Japanese yen exchange rate, must spend 110 million yen. The so-called current affairs assistance expenses, combined with the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, are only 52 million, and the remaining more than 560 million yen are mostly used for military purposes. The Army's new request to increase the number is 248 million yen, the Navy's is 234 million, and the total of the Army and Navy is 483 million yen. The total of the remaining new requests is only over 78 million yen. This is the performance of Japan's so-called national defense.</p>
<p>If we add up the regular expenses and temporary expenses in the military, the Army's military expenditure is 448 million, the Navy's military expenditure is 488 million, and the total military expenditure of the Army and Navy is 936 million, accounting for more than 44% of the total expenditure. This is really an alarming military expenditure in a state of emergency. Who can say that Japan is not actively preparing for war?</p>
<p>So ignorant, it is not surprising that the general public in Japan often have dissatisfied discussions in the streets and corners. Therefore, dangerous ideas are constantly developing. There is a gradually universal resistance movement against such blind military adventurism, and there are also many dissenting voices from the capitalist side. Therefore, on the 9th of this month, the Army and Navy specifically issued a statement in the form of a conversation, saying that there is a crisis in 1936, saying that the military does not sacrifice the interests of the common people, and saying that national defense should be and is necessary. But what is the effect? It is not yet visible. From a fair observation, it is also thought that it is equal to the theory of the divine country, which does not help the panic of the Japanese people.

<h3 id="e83">National Army Recaptures Chong'an <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>The Central Army of Jiangxi, Fujian, and Zhejiang Completes Liaison</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: After the Northern Route Army recaptured Guangze, it has established close contact with the troops of Liu Heding, Zhou Zhiqun, and Zhang Luanji in northern Fujian. However, Chong'an was previously captured by the bandit puppet 7th Army due to the weakness of the defending troops. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek ordered Zhang Luanji's brigade to advance to Chong'an to suppress the bandits. Zhang's brigade arrived in Chong'an on the 20th and fought fiercely with more than 2,000 bandits for a day and night, killing many bandits. On the 21st, Chong'an City was recovered. A telegram has now been sent to the headquarters to report the victory. Chong'an borders Zixi, Guixi, Qianshan, and Shangrao in eastern Jiangxi to the west, Shaowu and Jianyang to the south, Pucheng and Songxi to the north, and is also connected to Zhenghe and Jian'ou. It is extremely important to the military affairs of the borders of Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Fujian. Now that it has been recovered by Zhang's brigade, the central armies in eastern Jiangxi, northern Fujian, western Zhejiang, and southern Zhejiang are gradually connecting and communicating closely, which can make a large encirclement of the Jiangxi bandits and the Fujian army.</p>
<p>The highest military authority recently announced the intelligence obtained from Fujian, roughly as follows: Chen and Li have decided to take a defensive posture towards Guangdong and an offensive posture towards Jiangxi and Zhejiang. The bandits will come out of eastern Jiangxi, and the Fujian army will come out of northern Fujian, advancing towards the borders of Jiangxi and Zhejiang together. However, the central army in Shaowu, Guangze, Chong'an, Pucheng, and Songxi in northern Fujian has large armies arriving, and large armies are also gathering along the above-mentioned areas of eastern Jiangxi, western Zhejiang, and southern Zhejiang. It is expected that the Fujian army and the Jiangxi bandits will not succeed. (December 22nd)</p>

<p>The labor-management dispute at the Zheng County Yufeng Cotton Mill was resolved on the 20th of this month. The mediation decision and the maintenance fee settlement method are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲Mediation Decision (1) With the consent of both labor and management, the mediation decision made by labor and management on August 16 of this year, as amended this time, is incorporated into this decision.

<h3 id="e85">Local Products Along the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Road <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Exhibition of Local Products to be Held</p>
<p>on the Day of the Opening Ceremony</p>
<p>The Hangzhou-Jiangshan Road starts from Xixing on the right bank of the Qiantang River in Hangzhou, passes through Xiaoshan, Zhuji, Yiwu, Jinhua, Tangxi, Longyou, Qu County, Jiangshan, and reaches Yushan in Jiangxi. All the areas along the route are rich in local products. Now that the entire line has regular bus service, it is convenient for the export of local products from various counties along the line. The timber, bamboo, winter bamboo shoots, dried bamboo shoots, tea, and medicinal materials from the old Longquan, Songyang, and Suichang areas, as well as the porcelain, summer cloth, white paper, tea, tobacco, and coal from eastern Jiangxi, can also be promoted and sold. The Construction Department will hold a local product exhibition along the line when holding the opening ceremony on the 28th, to show the richness of eastern Zhejiang's local products, which urgently need to be sold abroad. The reporter has made a special investigation of the local products along the road as follows, so that readers who are unable to attend the exhibition can also learn about them.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Salt <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Zhejiang Province produces salt in various coastal areas, with Yuyao and Shaoxing counties as the center. Yuyao produces 180,000 yin of sun-dried salt annually (each yin is 370 market catties), which is sold throughout the 26 counties in the Zhejiang salt area, with each yin worth 4 to 6 yuan, and a total value of 800,000 to 900,000 yuan. It produces 20,000 yin of boiled salt, with a total value of more than 100,000 yuan. The Shaoxing salt sales area is the old Jinquyan area and 22 counties including Tonglu and Fuyang, as well as Guangxin in Jiangxi and the three counties of Yixiu and Shexian in southern Anhui. Among them, Guangxin County has the largest sales volume, reaching more than 30,000 yin annually, Xiuning about 20,000 yin, and Jiangshan, Kaihua, Lanxi, and Zhuji each about 12,000 to 13,000 yin. The total annual sales are more than 200,000 yin. The brine crystals from the Yuyao and Shaoxing salt farms have a total annual value of 6,000 to 7,000 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Rice and Tea <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Xiaoshan, Zhuji, Yiwu, Wuyi, Yongkang, Jinhua, Lanxi, Longyou, and Qu County all produce rice, with Jinhua, Longyou, and Qu County being the most abundant. The annual output is about 1.2 million dan in Jinhua, about 100,000 dan in Longyou, and about 300,000 dan in Qu County, totaling 1.6 million dan, valued at 13.6 million yuan. The tea-producing areas along the line are most abundant in Zhuji, Pujiang, Dongyang, Wuyi, Xianju, Changshan, Kaihua, Jiangshan, Yushan, and Wuyuan, with an annual output of more than 40,000 dan, valued at 1.5 to 1.6 million yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Livestock <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>

The annual output is about 33,000 heads, with a total value of more than 1.97 million yuan. Farmers raise pigs most commonly in the old Jingshu Dongyang, Jinhua, Yongkang, Yiwu, Wuyi Lanxi, Pujiang, Qu County, and Longyou. Farmers take pig manure to fertilize the soil, and feed them with barley and miscellaneous grains, so the meat is tender and delicious, far better than the pigs in northern Jiangsu. Jinhua and Quzhou can produce more than 900,000 pigs annually. In addition to being used for making ham, more than 173,000 pigs can be exported, with a total value of more than 3.3 million yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Ham <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>

The annual output is about 6,000 pieces, each made with 40 to 50 pigs, valued at 120 to 150 yuan, with a total value of about 800,000 yuan, mostly sold in Hangzhou. Lanxi is the second largest, mostly sold in Shanghai. Yiwu, Yongkang, and Pujiang each account for half of Dongyang's output. Jinhua produces about 1,000 pieces annually. Tangxi and Wuyi export very little. The forelegs of pigs are pickled into wind meat. The output is the largest in Yiwu, Pujiang, and Dongyang counties, with an annual output of about 5,000 pieces, valued at 250,000 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Paper <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Qu County and Longyou are famous for producing paper. The paper produced in Longyou is mostly Nanping paper, which is sold in Shanghai, Hangzhou, Changzhou, and various parts of Shandong, Henan, and Hebei, with an annual output of about 135,000 pieces. The second is fancy paper, about 15,000 pieces, all used for sacrifices. The next is yellow paper, also used for superstitions. The total of Nanping and fancy paper is 150,000 pieces, valued at 900,000 yuan. Qu County paper also has three types: Nanping, fancy paper, and yellow paper.

<h3 id="e91">Summer Cloth <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Summer cloth is produced in Yushan, Shangrao, Fuzhou, and Wanzai. Previously, Yushan exported 16,000 tubes (12 pieces per tube), but now only 5,000 tubes. Shangrao exported 10,000 tubes, but now only 4,000 tubes. The products of Yushan and Shangrao are both coarse summer cloth, used for making mosquito nets. Wanzai used to produce about 5,000 tubes, which was fine summer cloth. Tongxing and Linchuan products were famous at the time, but now there is no output.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Porcelain <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Longquan has a long history of producing porcelain. The products of Ge Kiln and Di Kiln in Nanxiang were famous in the Song Dynasty, and their products were treasured at home and abroad. In recent years, due to poor management, the annual output is only 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Zhuji has sand kilns that burn sand jars and wine altars, with total annual sales of more than 300,000 yuan. The porcelain of Jingdezhen could originally be transported to Yushan via Raozhou Huangjinbu and Hekou, with annual sales of 200,000 to 300,000 dan, but recently there have been frequent banditry, and many porcelain kilns have been destroyed.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Talc <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>There are many talc mines along the line. There are 26 talc mining areas in Pujiang, Yiwu, Jinhua, Tangxi, Suichang, Longyou, Jiangshan, Changshan, etc., with reserves of 644,373 metric tons. When mining began in 1917, the annual output was about 400 tons. There was a period of stagnation in 1919 and 1920. From 1921 to 1925, the total output was 11,000 tons. From 1926 to 1930, the annual average was about 8,000 tons, with 1928 being the most prosperous, with an output of more than 11,000 tons. After the January 28 Incident, sales declined sharply, and many stopped mining. It is said that 90% of the talc in Zhejiang Province is sold to the Japanese.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Tung Oil <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Tung trees and cypress trees are planted everywhere on the hillsides and fields of Zhuji, Pujiang, Yiwu, Dongyang, Jinhua, Yongkang, Lanxi, Shouchang, Jiande, Qu County, Changshan, and Jiangshan. The oil industry is particularly prosperous. After tung oil was exported to the United States, sales increased, making it a major export product of our country today. Cypress oil is also exported to the United States to make stearic acid candles and Stearin. In 1932, the output of tung oil along the line was more than 166,400 dan, valued at more than 2.94 million yuan.

<p>Miscellaneous News After the Robbery in Southern Henan (Continued)</p>
<p>I got off the train at Xinyang. At six o'clock the next morning, I transferred to a bus and went east, passing through Luoshan. At three o'clock in the afternoon, I arrived at Huangchuan. I was inspected upon entering the city. Even my lined clothes and cotton quilt had to be felt one by one. The inspection of the entire train compartment took more than an hour. The intention was probably to focus on drugs. A river divides the city into two, with a long bridge connecting them. The people in the streets of the city were usually deserted. At that time, the banknotes issued by a certain army suddenly lost their credit, and the city's finances were extremely chaotic. There were quite a few shops that announced they were settling accounts and suspending business. Soldiers accounted for the majority of those coming and going in the market. Women were rarely seen. Occasionally, a few women would slowly enter and exit the shops, and they would always be followed by several armed soldiers, which attracted crowds of villagers to watch. Women rarely go out. Is this due to the customs of the north, or is it due to the special circumstances at the time? It is a pity that I could not find out. The so-called special goods are sold exclusively by a certain public store designated by the Hubei Special Goods Resident Henan Commissioner's Office. If anyone sells or buys privately without affixing special tax labels, once caught, in addition to being dealt with in accordance with the anti-smoking regulations, the offender's assets will also be confiscated. It is also said that someone was caught privately selling heroin (it is said that it is still opium paste and not real heroin) and has been shot. These were all learned from the newly posted notices on the wall.</p>
<p>Regarding the construction of the Huangchuan New Village, I went to the headquarters to inquire, but I did not get any clues. I was transferred to the county government, and I learned that the so-called New Village plan was proposed by Hu Shiqing, a shareholder of the Henan Zhongyuan Company. Although the authorities intended to adopt it, it has not yet been implemented. The rumor that there is a New Village Office in Huangchuan is also completely false. In terms of the immigration policy, Commander Liu estimates that the funding required is more than 4 million yuan, but only 100,000 yuan has been received, so it is impossible to start. I traveled thousands of miles to come here, and suddenly I heard this statement, and a burst of joy turned into a cold-hearted ice heart. The Chinese people have always liked to exaggerate and boast, often using blank paper and empty words to show off. The situation this time is exactly like this. The reporter was unwilling to make this trip in vain, so he specially asked the county government to issue a passport and changed it to an inspection of the "Jingfu" County, which was established in the recovered area. The information obtained is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Jingfu County was originally the Xinjizhen Township of Guangshan. It was lost for more than two years. In the autumn of last year, it was recovered by Tang Shi, part of General Liu Zhi's army in Henan. Commander-in-Chief Chiang, based on the needs of the terrain, rebuilt the county seat, so it was named Jingfu after Liu's name, and the county was named after it. The area is surrounded by mountains on all sides, with Guangshan and Luoshan to the north, Shangcheng and Lihuang (formerly a famous Red area Jinzhai, recovered by Wei Lihuang's army, was renamed the county after Wei's name) to the east, and Macheng and Huang'an to the south, all hundreds of miles away. There is a solid stone city, mostly inhabited by gentry and landlords, which has long been coveted by the Red bandits, and they wanted to seize the land in order to connect with the Red Army in Shangcheng and Huang'an, as a base for spying on Wuhan. On the 7th of July in 1919, the Red Fourth Army and the Twenty-fifth Army troops launched a large-scale siege. They did not take it down for more than a month. The bandits then tunneled and bombed the north city. With a loud noise, dust rose high, and the city wall collapsed by dozens of feet. The civil defense team in the city paid full attention to this. Unexpectedly, the bandits adopted the method of making a feint in the east and attacking in the west. On one side, they climbed the city wall from the south and entered the entire city. In order to prevent the defense from being solid, all the city gates were filled with wood, stones, and cloth bags, and it was impossible to escape in a hurry. Everyone was afraid and laid down in the city, and no one was safe. Later, in order to implement their doctrine and suppress counter-revolutionaries, those who were generally regarded as local tyrants and evil gentry were arrested, killed, and punished as easily as taking something out of a pocket. The disaster was more severe than elsewhere. The reason is here.</p>
<p>The bandits first attacked the city several times, large and small, for more than a year. The city was firmly defended and they failed to succeed. This time, it was captured because they were afraid that it would be difficult to occupy it for a long time, so they demolished the city walls in advance in order to recapture it in the future. And they judged the situation and established the Soviet Government of the Hubei, Henan, and Anhui Border Region here. The first step was to confiscate the fields of officials, tyrants, and gentry, and other land. The village was the unit, and the land was distributed according to the population and labor of middle peasants, poor peasants, and hired peasants. A mass meeting of the whole village was convened, and land commissioners were elected from the workers and peasants. The Land Committee was organized by 17 to 21 people. The gong was sounded to gather the people, and they went to step on the fields and mountains together. First, the Red Army's public land was taken out and divided, and then the nearby and distant fields, mountains, forests, ponds, and bamboo gardens were calculated as a total. The good and bad were matched and mixed for division. The list of divided land was posted. If someone thought that the division was not good, they could propose revisions. The Workers and Peasants Supervision Committee, the Red Party's various levels of supervision committees, and the Political Department of the Bandit Army all accepted lawsuits for unfair land distribution. The general workers, hired peasants, poor peasants, and especially the family members of the bandit army, were able to raise their heads greatly and actively attack the rich peasants and landlords. The disaster of killing was also very tragic.</p>
<p>At the same time, they also forced the formation of teams according to gender and age. Those from eight to fourteen years old were the Young Pioneers, those from fifteen to twenty were the Youth Vanguard, those from twenty-one to forty were the Red Guards, guerrillas, transportation teams, and stretcher teams. There was also an obligation to join the Red Army. The young and strong of the women were organized into comfort teams, and the middle-aged were organized into laundry or sewing teams. There were also production teams, and men, women, and children were required to participate as much as possible, mobilizing manpower and animal power to help those who lacked manpower and animal power in other places to cultivate. If there was wasteland to be reclaimed, criminals with lighter crimes were organized into reclamation teams to work hard. The suffering of the people cannot be described in a word.</p>
<p>The area is mountainous and dangerous, bordering three provinces. The successive attacks by the National Army were not uniformly commanded, and the situation was different, making it difficult to make progress. The bandit area was expanded, and there was a tendency to flee east to Bengbu. Later, the General Headquarters for Diligence in Suppressing Bandits in the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui was established. Commander-in-Chief Chiang came to Wuhan to supervise the suppression, and Deputy Commander Li Jishen was stationed in Bengbu to provide support. Liu Zhi, the director of appeasement in Henan, also came to Luoshan to supervise the army. The various forces advanced together and successively recovered various places. The bandit forces became increasingly isolated. Liu's army, led by Tang, advanced towards Xinjizhen, beheading hundreds of bandits, and finally recovered the city. Jingfu County was newly established, and city walls and bunkers were built, and the Baojia system was established. Although there are still a small number of gray civilians and sporadic bandits who are stubbornly resisting in remote areas, and are thinking of moving. Now that Liu Zhenhua, the commander of the Bandit Suppression Headquarters in the border area of the three provinces, is stationed in Huangchuan, suppressing and appeasing at the same time, the area has been pacified. The Red bandit military supplies seized include a Ningsi No. 4 aircraft, more than ten mortars and pistols, more than twenty machine guns, three or four thousand rifles, and countless items from the pseudo-cooperative and various levels of Soviet government. It is said that there is still a part of the scattered bandits hiding sharp weapons in the deep mountains and forests, who are like desperate bandits. They go down the mountain in the middle of the night and assassinate those who have surrendered and reformed, calling it "touching the melon." Their whereabouts are uncertain. It is feared that there will be changes if they are recruited, and there is no way to capture them if they are killed. They are now being collected by the civilians and strong men in the mountains, hoping to eliminate their traces and secure the four borders.</p>
<p>Business in the city is deserted, and refugees are gathered, suffering from cold and hunger, and there are many sick people. The scene is bleak and unbearable to see. Most of the goods sold are cigarettes, alcohol, food, and paper. Most of the buyers are military and political personnel. Villagers rarely enter the city unless they are selling firewood or buying salt. There is only one newly established elementary school in the entire territory, with more than thirty students. The funds are only the county government's monthly subsidy of 20 yuan, and the county government's political expenses are maintained by the provincial government, which is also very limited. The opinions of the local people, military and political circles on the aftermath measures vary, and their opinions differ. Some say that it is appropriate to start with solving the land problem, thinking that the banditization of the people is not their original intention. It is actually due to the opposition between the tenants and the landlords, the disparity between the rich and the poor, and the instigation of the Red Party, which led to taking risks. If they can be properly appeased and made to cultivate the land with peace of mind, they will be influenced and abide by the law. Some say that it is appropriate to handle the immigration policy, thinking that the people in the bandit area have been deeply banditized. If the environment and air are not changed, it is difficult to guarantee that they will not repeat their old tricks if they encounter special objective conditions. Therefore, they advocate moving out the people who have been banditized and leading good people from other places to move in and cultivate the land. The former has no proper rules and regulations to follow, and the latter is working hard to try it out, but unfortunately it is limited by funding and has not yet seen any results.</p>

<p>Caojing is located on the coast of this county, and the residents all live by fishing and salt. The other day, a fisherman went out to sea to fish and returned fully loaded. He sold it to Jiang Zhengxing Fish Firm. Unexpectedly, Jiang Zhaoji Fish Firm solicited at a high price. The two fish firms quarreled with each other, and Jiang Zhaoji Fish Firm actually held this resentment and lured the brothers of Jiang Zhengxing Fish Firm to the coast. Taking them by surprise, they pushed them into the sea. At that time, the tide was rolling in. The brothers of Jiang Zhengxing Fish Firm drank their fill of salt water. Although they were rescued by people in time, their throats were damaged and they have not yet recovered. The victimized brothers of Jiang Zhengxing Fish Firm will file a negotiation with the owner of Jiang Zhaoji Fish Firm.</p>

<p>The twelfth train bound for Beijing from Shanghai passed through Shuitangwan Station in this county and entered Yangqi, outside of the east gate, at about 2 p.m. yesterday. A man of about forty years of age, wearing mourning clothes, suddenly jumped down and fell to the ground. His head was broken and bleeding. By the time he was picked up, his face was blurred, and he was seriously injured and unable to speak. Before long, he died. The Tu Zheng of that place reported to this county's court, and the appointed prosecutor led the officials to inspect the body. It was confirmed that he had died from injuries sustained in the fall. Because no family members could be found, the Tu Zheng was ordered to collect the body and put it in a coffin.</p>

<p>Yao Liangxiao, a notorious bandit who has repeatedly committed crimes at the border of Wujin and Danyang, is feared by the surrounding people. Yin Xicai, the patrol leader of the Fifth Squad directly under the Wuyi Police Team, recently received a tip that the bandit was passing by a certain place and going to Xinqiao in Danyang. He immediately led several police officers to rush to catch him. He captured Yao Liangxiao and found a pistol in his sister's house. He also searched everywhere for accomplices and successively captured suspected bandits Yao Wanshu, Wang Fuxing, Zhang Si, Yang Jiu, Wu Xiaosanzi, Tao Honggen, Cai Zhaosheng, Cai Yaoshi, and others. Yao Liangxiao's confession was firm and he did not reveal the truth. After repeated strict questioning, he confessed that he had robbed Chen Hongfan's house outside the north gate of Mengcheng. Yao Wanshu and Wang Fuxing, who came with him this time, were prepared to commit crimes together. Patrol leader Yin immediately transferred the witnesses to the police team headquarters. The team leader Mao Gangsheng transferred all the witnesses to the county government for interrogation yesterday (23rd).</p>

<p>Since the Zhenjiang County Government promoted the new weights and measures system, all industries in the provincial capital area have gradually become uniform. However, the medical and pharmaceutical industries have not yet complied with the changes, which is quite inappropriate. It is now planned to formally announce the completion of uniformity on January 1, 1934, with no further delays. Previously, an order from the Construction Department was issued to various counties in Jiangsu Province regarding the implementation of weights and measures for Chinese medicine, along with a conversion table between the old and new systems. This has been completed, submitted, and approved. To ensure cautious implementation and to facilitate the simultaneous implementation of both Chinese medicine and pharmaceutical industries, one copy each of the implementation methods for weights and measures for Chinese medicine in Jiangsu Province and the conversion table between the old and new systems for weights and measures for Chinese medicine in Zhenjiang County have been printed and distributed for application in both industries. It is stipulated that the new system will be implemented simultaneously starting from January 15th. All medical prescriptions must have a stamp indicating "Changed to New System" on the upper right corner, with a signature or seal and the date filled in the lower left corner to clarify responsibility. Yesterday, the methods and conversion tables were announced to all residents of the county for their general knowledge.</p>

<p>Zhang Yanglan, an 18-year-old first-year student at Jiangdu County Junior High School, is the daughter of Zhang Futong, an accountant at the Yangzhou Audit Branch. She received elementary education at home from a young age. This year, she took the entrance examination twice and was admitted to the school. During the exams a month ago, she failed two subjects, causing her great distress. Later, she heard the principal encourage students, stating that those who fail two subjects in the second monthly exam will be expelled. Upon hearing this, the student felt even more ashamed and indignant and doubled her efforts. However, she still failed two subjects in the second monthly exam. The student, feeling she was not making progress in her studies, developed a pessimistic view of life. On the 20th, after school, she returned home and spent a week bidding farewell to relatives, friends, and classmates before disappearing. She also sent a letter of farewell to her classmates Li Huanyun, Zhang Wanqing, and Cao Wenlan. After receiving the letter, these students rushed to inform her family, who dispatched people to search in all directions, but without any trace.</p>

<p>Chen Erdaizi, a villager from Tangjiazhuang in the sixth district of the county, was passing by Tang Xiaoliuzi's door on his way home the night before last (the 18th) when Tang mistook him for a thief. Tang led Xiaohuaizi and others, wielding knives, and chopped Chen Lianliu to death. Realizing the trouble he had caused, Tang, in an attempt to cover up the crime, hired a cart driver, Tang Yan'er, to dispose of Chen's body in Jiang Xiaozhuang, on the border of Jiangdu and Taixian. Chen's wife, Zhang, noticing that Chen had not returned, inquired with Yang, the wife of villager Tang Huai, and learned of the events. She then discovered Chen's body in Jiang Xiaozhuang and reported it to the Sixth Public Security Branch, which reported it to the Jiangdu Branch Court. Yesterday, Inspector Zhu, along with forensic officials and police officers, went to conduct an examination.</p>

<p>The Junshan Meteorological Observatory was founded by the late gentry Zhang Jian and has achieved considerable results. It is currently affiliated with Nantong College, but its funding is very limited, making it difficult to maintain. The county government specifically submitted a request to the Construction Department for county funds to be allocated for subsidies. On the 23rd, an order was received stating that the observatory's equipment is legitimate, its history is long, and its achievements are commendable. It is rare to have such a foundation in a private meteorological observatory in the country. The request to allocate 600 yuan annually from the county's construction funds and agricultural improvement funds to maintain the observatory is approved, starting from January 1934. It is stipulated that the observatory must send the results of meteorological tests conducted at 6:00 AM and 2:00 PM daily to the Construction Department for comparison and should provide the test results to meet the needs of construction and agriculture as much as possible. Special attention should be paid to reporting typhoons and high tides in summer and autumn.</p>

<p>Mo Sihai, Shen Wencai, and other farmers in Baihuazhuang Sanhewan, Tanghui Town, Jiaxing, make pickled vegetables every winter and sell them in various places in the spring. Currently, they are in the process of pickling vegetables. The day before yesterday, Zhu, the deputy captain of the First Team of the Jiahu Commercial Affairs Anti-Smuggling Camp, led salt police and forcibly claimed that the salt used by Mo and Shen for pickling vegetables was smuggled salt. They forced them to pay a fine of one hundred and four yuan, tied up the villagers with ropes, and detained them in the Baihuazhuang Temple. Eventually, they were forced to pay the fine, and sixteen jars of official salt were confiscated. It was found that the salt stored by the villagers was purchased from the Tongrun Sauce Garden in Tanghui and they had invoices from the garden as proof. However, the salt police arbitrarily made false accusations and extorted huge sums of money, showing a complete disregard for the law. Currently, more than ten township offices in the area are appealing to the All-Zhejiang Public Association, requesting them to uphold justice and petition the salt administration authorities to order an investigation to deter the illegal activities and reassure the farmers.</p>

<h3 id="e111">Shen Yi Discusses Developing Greater Shanghai <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the Municipal Government and its affiliated bureaus have been busy relocating, and it is expected that they can all move into the new municipal center area by the end of this month. A reporter from the Central News Agency specially went to the old site of the Municipal Bureau of Public Works to visit Director Shen Yi and inquire about his opinions on developing Greater Shanghai in the future. He was received and the conversation went as follows:</p>
<p>Primary Steps: Shen believes that completing the construction of Greater Shanghai should be divided into several steps. We are currently in a time of national crisis, and the city's economy is also very difficult. It is not easy to make active progress. In the past few years, the municipal authorities have painstakingly planned the construction of Greater Shanghai, and it was confirmed at that time that developing the city center area was the primary step in promoting the Greater Shanghai plan. After several years of efforts, the main roads in the city center area have been gradually completed, and the new municipal government building and temporary houses for various bureaus have also been completed. All staff will be able to move into the new buildings for office work soon.</p>
<p>Prosperity Plans: Shen's efforts to prosper the city center area focus on the driving forces of prosperity. The relocation of the Municipal Government and its affiliated bureaus is not as important as building the Qiujiang Wharf, opening a commercial port, and relocating the train station, but Shen believes that the relocation of the Municipal Government is also one of the driving forces for the prosperity of the city center area. As for building the wharf and other matters, they are indeed important driving forces, but implementing such projects may not be permitted by the current environment. After the Municipal Government and various bureaus relocate, they will pay attention to another driving force, such as libraries, museums, and sports fields, all of which are necessary constructions for the prosperity of the city. Shen feels that with the current financial constraints of the city, construction cannot be carried out simultaneously, and all municipal buildings will be given priority in the city center area, based on the city's financial capacity.</p>
<p>Citizen Cooperation: Shen also stated that while the municipal authorities will do their best to develop the city center area, they also expect all citizens of the city, whether in the banking or industrial and commercial sectors, to invest in the city center area as a priority or to start businesses, so as to achieve the effect of government-citizen cooperation. The Municipal Government and its affiliated bureaus, and all staff, have become the vanguard of the citizens, moving into the city center area to show the government's determination to prosper the city center area. Shen also informed that although the construction of the city center area is recognized by the Chinese people as a matter of urgency, foreign commentators often criticize it as being merely empty talk. The reason why they make such comments is that the development of the city center area will inevitably deal a great blow to the concessions. Therefore, our citizens should sincerely assist the government to complete the Greater Shanghai plan.</p>
<p>Renovating Old Areas: Shen still believes that the renovation of the old urban area should not be neglected. The renovation of the old urban area will be based on a stable approach. In the past, after the Dongmen Street of Xiaodongmen and the Heping Road of Laoximen were developed, the market in those areas immediately became prosperous. In the future, the attitude of caution will be adopted in opening roads. He has many plans for renovating the old urban area, but they are often limited by funding and subject to other constraints, so they have not been realized sooner. The streets in the old urban area are mostly rugged and uneven and should be repaired quickly to facilitate pedestrian traffic. The ditches have been in disrepair for a long time and lack a system, and they will also be renovated.</p>

<h3 id="e119">Clean-Up Campaign Held Today <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>The 12th Clean-Up Campaign in this city is scheduled to be held today. The city street sweepers and garbage trucks will gather at the Maojialong Health Bureau this morning and parade through the city. The truck bodies are pasted with slogans formulated by the Health, Public Security, Social Education, and four bureaus. The street sweepers and police officers on the trucks will distribute leaflets during the parade. All street sweepers in their respective sections will clear out the garbage in their areas. Officials from all bureaus will go to residences, businesses, factories, schools, and organizations for inspections. All affiliated agencies of each bureau will carry out a general cleaning. However, due to the limited funds allocated by the Municipal Government, only 200 yuan, the campaign will not be lavishly promoted.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Min Bandits' Initial Plan for Alliance of Offense and Defense Broken by National Army <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Red Bandit Front Collapses After Guangze is Recovered</p>
<p>Forced Recruitment of Civilians in Southern Fujian Has Aroused Resentment</p>
<p>Xinsheng News Agency reports that the great battle on the border of Zhejiang and Fujian is about to break out. Yesterday, a local agency obtained information from the front, stating that the vanguard troops of the Fujian side launched a full-scale attack from Taishun and Qingyuan. The Central Army has made thorough arrangements. The Taishun line is a rugged mountain path, suitable only for lightly armed troops and not for large armies with sufficient light and heavy equipment. Once the great battle begins, the Fujian army will be completely annihilated. However, the Fujian army knows that if the Central Government mobilizes the sea, land, and air forces simultaneously, it will be unable to resist. Therefore, it still relies on an alliance of offense and defense with the red bandits, attempting to increase its strength and deliberately using the dangerous mountain roads, along with the red bandits' tactics of dispersing to avoid immediate annihilation, to prolong the war. The first step in the plan of the Fujian army and the red bandits is to have the red bandits leave Shangrao in Jiangxi, pass through Guangfeng, and attempt to attack Changshan and Yushan to directly impact Quzhou in eastern Zhejiang, intending to cut off the Central Army on the Fujian-Zhejiang border. However, this conspiracy was discovered by the Central Army on the front line, which moved first. Then the □□□ unit of the Central Army launched a head-on attack in Guangze, cutting the bandit army in half. One group fled into Zhejiang, and the other was defeated and collapsed in Jiangxi. The previous rumors in this city about the battle in eastern Zhejiang were actually this battle in which the bandits and the Fujian side colluded internally and externally. However, it has now completely failed. In addition, according to intelligence reports, in addition to buying over the bandits led by Fan Tiemin in Shouning, the Fujian rebels are also actively reorganizing local militias, bandits, and knife gangs in the rear of Fujian Province to fill the so-called People's Self-Defense Army. However, due to incomplete equipment and lack of funding, they cannot form an army. However, it is worth noting that the Fujian rebels are colluding with the communists and completely lifting the blockade. Therefore, the bandit side has recently purchased a large amount of salt and goods in Fuzhou and transported them to bandit areas through Yangkou, Shunchang, Jiangle, and Taining to provide the red bandits with material needs. At the same time, the Fujian puppet government, seeing the difficulty in organizing the militia, is forcibly recruiting people from the people in southern Fujian. Families with three or more able-bodied men must send one person to serve as a reserve force. The people are forced by the coercion and are mostly brewing resistance. The fact that they cannot win the support of the people is evident. Therefore, no one believes in the deceptive slogan of "distributing land according to population". Although Zhangzhou, Xiamen, and Minhou are seemingly still calm on the surface, their internal instability is growing. The future of the so-called People's Government is bleak.</p>
<h3 id="e121">All Silk Factories in This City Shut Down <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Total of More Than 60,000 Unemployed Workers</p>
<p>Due to Japanese Silk Invasion and Rural Bankruptcy</p>
<p>Silk is originally a major export product of our country. However, in recent years, one reason is the bankruptcy of rural areas in the country, and the other is the brisk sales of Japanese silk in Europe and the United States, resulting in a continuous decrease in the export of silk from our country. A reporter from Xinxin News Agency learned from the silk industry in this city yesterday that Shanghai originally had 65 silk factories. Recently, due to the plummeting price of silk, it has been difficult to maintain operations. In the past month, 63 factories have successively announced their closure. The remaining two factories are also in dire straits. The number of silk workers who have lost their jobs will also reach 60,000. This phenomenon has a great impact on the future of the silk industry and social security. It is heard that the National Economic Committee, in view of this, will organize a Silk Industry Control Committee to collect materials on the causes of the decline of the silk industry in the past in order to decide on steps for improvement and relief.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Manufacturers Petition for Tax Exemption <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Hopes to Achieve the Goal</p>
<p>Before the implementation of the tax collection, the flour manufacturers in this city, Fuxin, Fufeng, and Xinda, ordered wheat from various countries, totaling 24 ships, of which nine ships were directly ordered from the Cotton and Wheat Office of the Economic Committee, and two ships were sold by foreign merchants, all with tax guarantees from the Economic Committee, which should not be a problem. However, the remaining 13 ships were ordered by the manufacturers from local foreign merchants such as Quanlong, Xiangmao, and Lieji, which is a large amount. They have repeatedly discussed with the Ministry of Finance authorities to request tax exemption. Shen Shuyu from the Customs Administration came to Shanghai and scheduled to meet with representatives of the manufacturers yesterday. The details of the meeting and Shen's attitude are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e123">Yesterday Morning's Consultation <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>At 9:30 yesterday morning, Gu Xinyi, the leading representative of the manufacturers, went to Shen's residence to discuss the tax exemption situation. Shen proposed a certain opinion, and tax exemption was quite difficult. After Gu repeatedly explained the difficulties faced by the flour manufacturers in recent years, hoping that they would understand the difficulties of the business, Shen also expressed his sympathy. However, the Ministry of Finance has already issued an order, which seems difficult to exempt. However, the purpose of this tax increase is to protect domestic farmers and cannot increase the burden on industry and commerce. Shen promised to consult with the Minister of Finance before making a decision. It is expected that after another negotiation, the goal of tax exemption can be achieved.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Foreign Wheat Arrived in Shanghai <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>One ship of foreign wheat, about 8,000 tons, arrived yesterday. Two ships will be loaded today, and the remaining ships will arrive around the end of the month. The flour manufacturers stated that if the goal is not achieved, they will not unload the goods for the time being to show their determination. The foreign merchants who sell this foreign wheat are also quite anxious and hope to resolve the issue as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Expected to be Resolved <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>This time, in addition to the 11 ships of American wheat borrowed, there are a total of 13 ships of foreign wheat, totaling more than 110,000 tons, which have been registered with the Social Affairs Bureau. If taxes are collected according to the tax rate, the total tax amount will be more than 800,000 yuan. According to Gu Xinyi's statement to the Shenshi News Agency, at this time of financial constraints, there are many places where the government needs the assistance of manufacturers, and the government cannot bear to protect farmers at the expense of businesses. It is expected that after another one or two negotiations, a satisfactory solution can be achieved.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Zhu Jiqing Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Advocating for the Development of Northwest Wasteland Reclamation</p>
<p>And Decided to Propose at the Fourth Plenary Session</p>
<p>Central Committee member Zhu Jiqing arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The reorganization of the volunteer army under Zhu's command in the North China region has been completed by the Military Branch in Peiping. Zhu recently stated that the volunteer army in the Guanzhong area has all served the country, so he intends to propose to the Central Government to have the uncultivated wasteland in the northwest area for the volunteer army to garrison in order to develop the northwest. This trip is specifically to draft this plan, which is planned to be proposed at the Fourth Plenary Session. It is heard that the drafting content focuses on the development of northwest wasteland reclamation, and the entire draft will be completed within a few days.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Municipal Government Relocates to New Building <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Various Bureaus Officially Relocate Today</p>
<p>Celebration Ceremony to be Held on New Year's Day</p>
<p>The various bureaus under the Municipal Government have officially ceased operations from today and have begun to relocate to the new building in the city center area. The Municipal Government is also in the process of relocating. Due to the relocation, the various bureaus will not be able to operate effectively during the year. A large-scale celebration will be held on New Year's Day. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e128">Relocation Begins Today <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>The various bureaus under the Municipal Government began to relocate today. (1) The Land Bureau moved to its new address today and will be completed in about three days. The bureau has very few rooms at the new address, and the drawing room of the Third Section is not enough to arrange, so it will remain at the original site of Yesiyuan for office work. The city's grain cabinet originally borrowed civilian houses. Now that it has been relocated, the original old bureau site will be temporarily used for the grain cabinet to work. (2) The Social Affairs Bureau also officially moved today. After the relocation, three or four people will be temporarily left at the original site of Dananmen to receive and send documents and contact affairs. As for the original houses, they originally belonged to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. How to deal with them in the future is still uncertain. Most of them may be returned to the landlord, leaving one or two rooms for office use, which is also unknown. (3) The Health Bureau also moved today and has set up an office at the Nanshi Clinic on Penglai Road. Public affairs such as school health and street cleaning will be handled by the office. It is also planned to choose a location on the original site of the Land Bureau or the Social Affairs Bureau for the establishment of the Nanshi Hospital, which is currently being discussed separately. (4) The Education Bureau has wrapped up all the documents of the various sections a few days ago and is scheduled to relocate all of them on the 26th. It is planned not to set up a separate office. (5) The Bureau of Public Works has actually moved in gradually due to various construction projects in the city center area. From today, all documents and equipment have also been largely moved in. (6) The Municipal Government is scheduled to officially move in on the 28th. (7) The Bureau of Public Utilities, the Bureau of Finance, and the Bureau of Public Safety will temporarily remain in their old locations because the houses have not been built. However, the Bureau of Public Safety previously had a plan to move to the original site of Shanghai County, but now that the houses there have not been repaired, it is uncertain when it can be realized.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Establishing Joint Office <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>The city center area is a newly created central area, located on the riverside, with a secluded scene, very different from the bustling city area. However, most citizens are gathered in southern Shanghai and cannot follow the Municipal Government to leave. In the future, in order to facilitate contact affairs on all sides, the Municipal Government and various bureaus plan to set up offices. However, the municipal bureaus are planning independently, which is not conducive to centralized office work, and the expenditure is also considerable. Previously, someone proposed that each bureau set up a joint office within the Municipal Government office. Whether it can be realized in the future, whether the address is at the old site of the Municipal Government at Fenglin Bridge, and whether it is necessary for each bureau to set up an office will be formally decided after another meeting.</p>
<h3 id="e130">New Year's Celebration Ceremony <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>After the municipal government bureaus moved in, they were all decorated anew. They were also preparing to erect colorful arches and host banquets, to hold a grand celebration ceremony on New Year's Day to commemorate the occasion. Invitation letters will be sent to leaders from the city's gentry, business, academic, and labor circles, as well as all citizens, to attend the ceremony. At that time, the municipal government will provide several public cars to pick up and drop off guests attending the ceremony.</p>

<p>The city's Bureau of Trade received a letter yesterday from the Western California branch of the American International Trade Bureau, stating that the bureau was established to serve society, promote international trade, and abolish monopolistic business practices, with a particular responsibility to introduce domestic and foreign trade. They sincerely request to establish a permanent connection with the industrial and commercial circles of our country. The bureau has always believed that raw materials and manufactured products are needed by your country, and your country also imports a large amount of planned goods. Therefore, the bureau deeply hopes to establish trade relations with the business community of your country. Furthermore, the bureau plans to publish and distribute lists and price schedules of American goods to various members of the trade community. For any questions our merchants may have for the bureau, they will do their best to explain them in order to live up to their goodwill. Various sample price lists have been prepared for those interested in this matter to view. If your country has any samples or self-recorded information to send, the bureau will place them in major American cities for merchants to browse. The bureau especially pays attention to trade information, lists of manufacturers or purchasers, and various news beneficial to your country, and hopes that your department will provide strong support so that trade connections between the two countries can be realized as soon as possible, in order to promote trade between the two countries.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Exchange of Customs Duty Treasury Bills <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Ministry of Finance Announces Extension to June of Next Year</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance announced that the exchange of old customs duty short-term treasury bills with a fixed amount of 50 million yuan from the 19th year of the Republic for new bills with a revised fixed amount of 80 million yuan, which had previously been extended to the end of this month, will be suspended. In an instant, the deadline has arrived again, but the number of bill holders in various places requesting an exchange is still small. It is learned that the Ministry of Finance, in consideration of the convenience of bill holders, has specially extended the period for another six months, until June 30th of the 23rd year of the Republic. All holders of these old bills must exchange them for new bills at the local Central, China, and Communications Banks within the deadline.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Shipping Companies Jointly Raise Funds to Build a Yantai Dockyard <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Surveying Stone Grandmother Estuary</p>
<p>Actively Underway</p>
<p>Regaining Shipping Rights</p>
<p>The power of Chinese shipping in China, with China Merchants as the largest in the south, and Zhengji leading in the north, hence the saying "China Merchants in the South, Zhengji in the North". However, Zhengji's ships mostly hire Japanese senior crew members, and because there are no domestic dockyards in the north, each year when the ships enter the factory for repairs, contracts are also signed with Japanese dockyards. This not only allows rights to flow out, but also hinders shipping administration. The Tianjin Shipping Administration Bureau learned that Zhengji's dockyard contract with the Japanese will expire in April next year. Xu Daxing, the director of the Yantai Shipping Bureau, has repeatedly consulted with Zhang Zhengben, the owner of Zhengji, requesting that he not renew the lease after the contract expires, abolish the contract, and instead enter a domestic shipyard. However, there is no complete dockyard in North China, and going to Shanghai is inconvenient. Therefore, after consultation, it was decided to establish a large dockyard in Yantai to meet the needs of North China's merchant ships, starting with government supervision and commercial operation. The first step is to survey the location and purchase land. This project has been submitted to the Ministry for approval, which has been forwarded to the Shandong Provincial Government to instruct the Yantai Administrative Commissioner to jointly prepare for and proceed with the project. Since this matter concerns shipping rights, it is urgently investigated and recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e134">Motivation for Building a Dockyard <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Xu Daxing, the director of the Yantai Shipping Bureau, believes that Zhifu and Longkou are the most developed areas for transportation in the north, and Zhengji Company's general management office is located in Yantai. Other shipping lines such as Huitong, Hexing, Fuxing, and Northern also have significant operations. Furthermore, many merchant ships from other domestic locations navigate to Yantai. In total, there are forty to fifty ships owned and managed on regular schedules. However, the most necessary dockyard for ships has not yet been established. Each time the ships encounter major or minor repairs, they often sail to Dalian, Lushun, or south to Hong Kong, Kowloon, or even east to Japan. The outflow of rights is a great pity. Therefore, the construction of a dockyard in Yantai is a matter of great urgency.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Impact on Fishery <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Without dockyard equipment, if the machine platform fails during shipping administration, it is difficult to repair it immediately and continue sailing, so the authority of the Shipping Bureau cannot be strictly enforced. Furthermore, Yantai is an important fishing area in North China. According to the Premier's industrial plan, it is an important fishing port. There are currently dozens of fishing vessels, and most of the annual repairs and new construction are also handled in Japan or Dalian. Therefore, the establishment of a dockyard directly recovers shipping rights and indirectly promotes the fishing industry.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Government Supervision and Commercial Operation <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>The establishment of a dockyard in Yantai cannot be delayed, and it must be realized in the short term. Now, after consultation, the establishment of a dockyard is nothing more than three types: government-run, government-business joint venture, and government-supervised commercial operation. If the government invests in construction, the scale can be grand, but it is feared that there will be no time for this. It has been decided to proceed with the government-supervised commercial operation plan first. Xu Daxing has repeatedly invited various shipping companies in Yantai to hold meetings and consultations, and Zhengji Company originally leased land from the Japanese government in Dalian to establish a private dockyard, which will expire in April next year. They were advised not to renew the lease after the expiration, and to jointly establish a large dockyard with various shipping bureaus, which was unanimously agreed upon. However, it is necessary to request government assistance to proceed.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Surveying the Location <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>The suitable location for building a dockyard in Yantai has been surveyed at the Stone Grandmother Estuary in the southeast of Zhifu Island. The coast there is more than a thousand feet above sea level. During the thirteenth year of the Republic, it was contracted to local people by the Yantai Official Property Clearance Office at a price of two yuan per mu. However, it is heard that the payment has not been made, and only a license from the Official Property Office has been obtained, but not a ministerial license. The people have not obtained legal property rights. Recently, it was heard that they plan to build a dockyard there and are engaging in speculation, raising the land price more than two hundred times. There are still problems with purchasing the land.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Government Assistance <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Since the people are making such demands, the government should transfer the matter to the local government and send personnel to investigate. The coast belongs to the state and should be taken back at the purchase price. The nearby land should be fairly evaluated. The matter has been approved by the Ministry of Communications and forwarded to the Shandong Provincial Government to instruct the Yantai District Administrative Commissioner to jointly handle the matter. Each transfer will be handled separately. Another Yantai construction office will be established and implemented.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Tax Exemption on Materials <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>At the beginning of the establishment, all construction funds will be filled by shipping companies. However, at the beginning of the establishment, a request was made to the Ministry of Finance to approve tax exemptions for machinery and materials purchased from foreign countries for the site, which can reduce costs and avoid competition from foreign merchants. The Ministry of Communications has already instructed that since merchants are willing to invest in construction, the government will do its best to support them. Currently, the matter is being expedited. It is expected that within a year, the large Yantai dockyard in North China can be completed, and thereafter, domestic merchant ships will no longer need to enter Japanese shipyards.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Workers on Both Wusong Factory Lines Decide to Resume Work This Morning <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Ban Moheng Awaits Processing</p>
<p>Ministry Member Returns to Report Today</p>
<p>The Dagong News Agency reports that all workers at the Wusong Zhanghuabang machine factory and materials department, due to Ban Moheng's destruction of the labor movement, demanded that the bureau dismiss and investigate him, and declared a work slowdown starting on the 18th of this month. After the Central Organization Committee and the Ministry of Railways sent personnel to Shanghai to mediate, a considerable result has been achieved. The workers are scheduled to resume work uniformly starting this morning. Since the work slowdown at the Wusong machine factory and materials department, the party departments and labor unions on both lines have sent personnel to persuade them, but to no avail due to the workers' firm will. The Central Organization Committee and the Ministry of Railways sent personnel to Shanghai to handle the matter. At 5 PM the day before yesterday, they met with Wang Bi, Yuan Boyang, Lu Baogan of the Railway Bureau, Chen Chengshi, Li Dasan of the Party Departments on both lines, and Min Luobi of the Labor Union, etc., and went to Wusong to convene all foremen and section chiefs of the Wusong factory office to discuss solutions and provide persuasion. It was finally decided that the Ministry of Railways would be responsible for thoroughly investigating the Ban Moheng matter, and all workers should resume work first. Each person, in order to comply with the advice of higher authorities, expressed acceptance, and held a workers' congress at 7 AM yesterday morning, deciding to resume normal work at 6 AM this morning. The Ban Moheng matter will be submitted to the authorities for strict investigation.</p>
<p>Monitoring at Wusong The authorities are deeply concerned that there may be misunderstandings when the workers resume work this morning. Therefore, Wang Wenbin and Zhang Weici, the counselors sent by the Ministry of Railways, and Luo Meihuan of the Central Organization Committee, decided to go to Wusong this morning with Yuan Boyang, Wang Bi, and Lu Baogan, representatives of the Railway Bureau, Chen Chengshi and Li Dasan of the Party Departments on both lines, and Min Luobi of the Labor Union, etc., to monitor the workers' resumption of work to avoid further twists and turns.</p>
<p>Returning to Beijing to Report The counselors of the Ministry of Railways, Wenbin and Zhang Weici, and Luo Meihuan, director of the General Affairs Department of the Central Organization Committee, who were ordered to come to Shanghai to handle the labor unrest at the Wusong machine factory, have come to a conclusion. After inspecting the resumption of work in Wusong this morning, they are scheduled to take a train back to Beijing this afternoon to report their mission. Regarding the workers' accusations against Ban Moheng, they will request instructions after returning to Beijing and then handle the matter.</p>

<h3 id="e142">Sichuan Sui Prefectural Association Hosted the Press Yesterday <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Accusing Liu Cunhou of Crimes, Requesting Arrest and Trial in Beijing</p>
<p>Requesting Removal of Liu Bangjun from Military Post to Avoid Instigating Civil Unrest</p>
<p>The Xin Sheng News Agency reports that since the seven counties including Suiding in Sichuan were ravaged by bandits, the affected people have fled to Chongqing and other neighboring counties, reaching hundreds of thousands. A few representatives traveled to Shanghai to organize the Sichuan Sui Prefectural Association of Refugees in Shanghai. After preparations by Peng Fenggen and others, it was officially established yesterday at No. 38, Riyuhui Lane, Jin Shenfu Road. At 1 PM, they hosted the local press at the 9th floor of the YMCA, reporting on the disaster and submitting a document to the National Government, clearly ordering the arrest and trial of Liu Cunhou in Beijing. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Hosting Reporters After the association was established, Peng Fenggen, Wu Nanping, Kuang Houfeng, Zheng Zuoqing, Wu Wenxiong, Qu Chuandai, Wang Ziliang, and others were elected as executive committee members and submitted the filing to the party and government agencies. At 1 PM, all the committee members and Li Yansheng and other representatives of the Sichuan Sui Prefectural refugees hosted reporters from local newspapers at the 9th floor of the YMCA.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report During the meeting, Chairman Li Yansheng reported that he had gone to Fuzhou to meet with Chairman Jiang to report on the circumstances of the seven counties including Suiding falling to the bandits, and Liu Cunhou's fleeing upon hearing the news and providing funds and weapons to the enemy. Chairman Jiang was furious and has sent personnel to investigate the truth. In Beijing, he met with President Lin of the National Government and President Wang of the Executive Yuan. President Lin sent Military Counselor Lu (Shao) to meet with him and promised to handle the matter strictly. President Wang also sent Secretary Liu to receive him and promised to order Liu Duban (Xiang) to investigate and handle the matter strictly. However, Liu Bangjun, the commander of the First Division who protected Liu Cunhou, is cowardly, incompetent, and lacks military skills, which is not up to the people's expectations. Therefore, he specially requests the National Government and the Military Commission to remove Liu from his military post and transfer other troops to be stationed for suppression to appease the people. As for Li's report on the disaster in the seven counties including Suiding, it has been detailed in the submitted documents and will not be recorded separately.</p>
<p>Document Submitted to the National Government Sichuan Suiding Seven County Refugee Association in Shanghai submits a document to the President of the National Government, the President of the Executive Yuan, and the Chairman of the Military Commission, the original text reads: Presented to request the arrest of Liu Cunhou to rectify military discipline, and request the withdrawal of Liu Bangjun's order to accept the 23rd Army to comply with public opinion, respectfully presented in anticipation of review. I, the 23rd Army Commander Liu Cunhou, lightly abandoned the fact that Suiding, Xuanhan, Wanyuan, and Chengkou counties, has been detailed in the telegram on the 31st. Subsequently, in the newspapers, I respectfully read Chairman Jiang's telegram, which has dismissed Liu Cunhou from his post for investigation, ordering Liu Bangjun to accept the troops of the army, etc. We, the refugees' representatives of the seven counties, including Tiyuan and Sui, all believed that Liu Cunhou's crime was severely punished lightly, and Liu Bangjun's military management was unskillful, cowardly, and incompetent, which was not up to Chairman Jiang's intention of making amends for his sins. We appealed to Chairman Jiang in a telegram on the Qiri, requesting that Bangjun be removed from his military post and that his troops be handed over to Commander Liu Xiang for reorganization and dismissal, and that they be dispatched in the case, which I believe has been sent to you one after another. We should have waited quietly for a decision, but recently, the refugee representatives of the Sui counties have reported additional facts about Cunhou's abandonment of Sui and Xuan counties, which were not fully presented in the previous telegram. Therefore, we sent Comrade Li Yansheng to Beijing to present our sincere feelings in person. I will first summarize the main points and ask for your inspection. Liu Cunhou usually squeezes the people's wealth, exhausting his cruel methods. When he was about to withdraw, he levied a huge amount of more than one million on the four counties in the name of suppressing the bandits. The army went out to press and urge the payment. At that time, the people still hoped that he would resist the bandits and endured the pain without speaking out. However, once the Sui army fled wildly, the hundreds of thousands of people's houses and tombs were offered to the bandits. What is even more hateful is that when Cunhou withdrew from the south gate of Suicheng, tens of thousands of refugees crowded at the city gate. Cunhou ordered the soldiers to kill a way out, and hundreds of people were killed and injured. When he reached the floating bridge across the Qu River, the people followed one after another. Cunhou reached the opposite bank and ordered it to be cut off, and hundreds of people fell into the river and died. His heart is more cruel than the bandits. This should be combined and punished together. Cunhou has a large number of guns and ammunition in his storage. When the bandits were in short supply, the people of Sui and Xuan requested to borrow thousands of guns to help suppress the bandits, but he was stingy and did not give them. When he was about to withdraw, he sent representatives to plead and temporarily keep the troops as a backing, allowing the teams to act as vanguards, but he ignored them. He willingly held 7,000 to 8,000 guns and 4 to 5 million bullets in storage, according to Liu Bangjun himself. Handing over to the bandits, the people did not ask for them to be issued, and the army did not transport them when they withdrew. The crime of misleading the people is small, but the crime of helping the bandits is great. This should be combined and strictly punished. Cunhou has already hidden in Chongqing and is about to enter the province. We earnestly ask you to clearly order the arrest and trial. The association is willing to send personnel to confront each other. If it is false, we are willing to accept the crime of false accusation. Furthermore, Liu Bangjun was originally the commander of the First Division of the army. When the bandits invaded Sichuan, the Sui defense was disturbed. Bangjun should have led his troops to the battlefield to command and fulfill his duties. However, in the name of a representative, he went to the province last fall and stayed for a year. When the order to accept the troops was issued, if he had any bloodiness, he should have rushed to the place where the troops were concentrated to reorganize them day and night. Now, it is heard that the five-way army is unanimously advancing to suppress the bandits, but he secretly went to Chongqing and invites people from the military, political, and news circles in Zhang Qiuyongnianchun Restaurant, fabricating facts to cover up the ugly traces of his troops' retreat without fighting. With such behavior, how can he be expected to make amends for his sins? Moreover, the army has been stationed in Sui for ten years, and resentment has accumulated. The people have long sighed that they will die together. If Bangjun is allowed to accept his troops again, and they are still stationed there after Suixuan is recovered, it will inevitably lead to civil unrest. The pain this time has been deep, how can we allow the army to burn the beans again to fry them? We earnestly ask you to investigate and approve the dismissal of Bangjun from his military post to save the remnant. As for the army, there may be useful people, and we also ask Commander Liu Xiang to reorganize and dismiss them, using it as a prelude to reducing troops and saving military expenses, and completing the great plan of political unification as soon as possible. I will wait for orders in camp. Furthermore, the refugees of Suixuan who have fled to neighboring counties number hundreds of thousands. At the end of the year and the cold weather, food and clothing are difficult. We earnestly ask Commander Liu Xiang to recover Suixuan by the deadline so that the refugees can return to their homeland as soon as possible. Otherwise, the tragic situation of displacement will worsen day by day, and there are unimaginable consequences. We have a straightforward nature and know how to take care of ourselves. We rarely discuss military and political affairs. Recently, we have received telegrams from refugees urging us to speak out to the authorities. We are concerned about our homeland and cannot ignore it. We have submitted them repeatedly. It is not our intention. We are weeping and asking for orders, and we hope that you will consider and adopt them. Then, the millions of people in Suixuan will all wear the virtue of rebirth. In addition to the personal presentation by Representative Li, we have prepared a document for your review and approval, and respectfully present it to the Chairman of the National Government Lin, the President of the Executive Yuan Wang, and the Chairman of the Military Commission Jiang.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Guangdong Provincial Government Consults the Ministry of Finance to Quickly Resolve the Qinlian Cane Sugar Case <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Consultation Document Delivered to Pang Songhui to Present to the Ministry of Finance in Person</p>
<p>Guangdong is a province that produces a lot of sugarcane in our country. The green sugar of Chaomei, the red sugar of Qiongya, and the white sugar of Lianzhou are all famous. Unfortunately, most of them are made using traditional methods and have not been improved. There have been a few counties that have used machines to make sugar, such as Dongguan, Hepu, and Lingshan. Recently, the province has been vigorously implementing a three-year administration plan, striving to revitalize the sugar industry. Recently, the Construction Department prepared the headquarters of the five major sugar factories, and the military reclamation area also prepared to establish a sugar factory. It also dispatched eighteen technicians to the Philippines to study sugar refining. The provincial government also hired two American sugar experts as sugar industry consultants, with a desire to catch up quickly. Unexpectedly, the emerging sugar industry plan has not yet been realized, and the original local sugar exported from Qinlian and other places to Shanghai was repeatedly fined and confiscated by the Jianghai Customs, resulting in suspension of operations. This case caused a sensation throughout the province. People from all walks of life generally believe that this is a fatal blow to the province's agricultural, commercial, and economic sectors. Letters and telegrams have been sent calling for relief, but the government has not resolved the matter after several months of delay. This time, Pang Songhui, the representative of the Qinlian sugar merchants, went to Guangzhou to petition. The Southwest authorities expressed outrage and tried their best to provide relief. The provincial government prepared a consultation document and handed it to Representative Pang to take to Beijing to present to the Ministry of Finance in person, requesting that it be investigated and resolved quickly in order to maintain domestic products. The consultation document from the Guangdong Provincial Government to the Ministry of Finance is as follows: For the matter of consultation, it is currently reported by Liao Zhuzhou, chairman of the Beihai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and Tan Qiaonan, chairman of the Hepu County Chamber of Commerce, etc., that according to a letter from the Qinlian Sugar Industry Guangyi Hall, it said, "We have received letters from our colleagues Heli, Henghalong, Guangchanghe, Heyi, etc., stating that from July to September of this year, our colleagues shipped local white sugar from Beihai to Shanghai five times. Each time, they reported to the Beihai Customs for inspection and confirmed that it was pure local sugar. They paid the transit tax in accordance with the regulations before they were released. Unexpectedly, when the original shipment arrived in Shanghai, it was completely detained by the Jianghai Customs Tax Affairs Department, claiming that it was mixed with 10% to 20% foreign sugar, and a total of 1,560 yuan was fined and 1,957 yuan was supplemented. The method used to distinguish between local sugar and foreign sugar has no standard and is prone to errors. Our colleagues have jointly submitted a telegram to appeal in the case, but it has not been resolved after more than a month. Our colleagues are innocent and have suffered a major loss, forcing us to temporarily suspend operations pending relief." A list of fines for each company is attached for verification, and we request that the Beihai Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Qinlian County Chambers of Commerce be forwarded to the Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance, ordering the Jianghai Customs Tax Affairs Department to issue the fines in full to show fairness, etc. We have examined that Beihai is an important port for the export of local sugar in South China, and the Beihai Customs is close to the sugar-producing area, and has a clear understanding of the composition of local sugar and the difference from foreign sugar. Therefore, our colleagues have reported and attached local sugar in the past, and they have all been inspected and released without any misunderstandings. Now, the original shipment has arrived in Shanghai, and the Jianghai Customs has identified it as mixed with foreign sugar and imposed a large fine, which is obviously abusing its power and destroying local sugar. If it is not stopped in accordance with the law, how can farmers and merchants be able to settle down? Therefore, we have recorded the case and reported it, and we request that it be forwarded to alleviate the merchants' difficulties, etc., as approved. We have examined that since the Jianghai Customs deducted and fined the local sugar case, sugar merchants have stopped transporting, resulting in considerable losses, and the farmers and workers in more than ten towns who rely on the sugar industry to make a living are likely to lose their jobs and go bankrupt. Livelihood and security are greatly affected. The letter was previously approved, and we will take this matter as a matter of livelihood for more than ten towns of farmers and merchants, and we will jointly convene the sugar industry and other trade associations, and all sugar merchants, to discuss relief measures. A total of four items were discussed and decided: (1) Please the Ministry of Finance to correct the erroneous method of the Jianghai Customs for inspecting the difference between local sugar and foreign sugar. (2) Please the Ministry of Finance to order the Jianghai Customs to release the local sugar of the Beihai sugar merchants and return the fines and tax supplements collected in the past. (3) Please the Executive Yuan to order the customs offices throughout the country to protect the safety of local sugar imports and exports, and not to deliberately delay. (4) Please the Central Government to clearly exempt local sugar from export and transit taxes, and to set up a local sugar export incentive program. It was unanimously passed, in addition to telegrams and separate reports, we have specifically recorded the case and reported it to your government, and we have publicly appointed Pang Songhui as a representative to personally present everything. We still hope that you will cherish the hundreds of thousands of sugar farmers and merchants in Qinlian and other places who are in a situation of unemployment and provide special relief, and separately forward them to the Executive Yuan, and consult the Ministry of Finance to adopt and implement the above four items as much as possible. The Qinlian sugar industry is fortunate, and the national industry is fortunate, etc. In view of this, the matter concerns the transportation and sales of local sugar and the revitalization of domestic industry and commerce, and we request your ministry to investigate and handle it. In addition to replying, we should consult and still look forward to seeing the restoration, to connect with public friendship, this consults the Ministry of Finance.</p>

<p>More Than 1,300 Guests</p>
<p>The Guangdong Shanghai Fellow-Provincials Association has been established for nearly a year, and the number of members has exceeded several thousand.

The opening ceremony was held at 2 PM yesterday. In addition to representatives from party and government agencies, more than 1,300 representatives from various fellow-provincial associations and gentry and business circles attended.

Various agencies, organizations, and individuals sent gifts, such as flower baskets, silver shields, couplets, and mirror frames, which were dazzling and beautiful. It is said that the association is scheduled to officially move into the office today. The details are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e146">Names of Attendees <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>In addition to Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Secretary-General Yu Hongjun, Section Chief Li Dachao, and Municipal Public Security Bureau Chief Wen Hongen, there were representatives from various fellow-provincial associations and gentry and business circles, such as Zheng Hongnian, Yu Qiaqing, Wu Chengyu, Tang Haian, Yan Zhifang, Xi Guansheng, Li Zukui, Zheng Zhengqiu, Shi Dezhi, Guo Shun, Ye Gongchuo, Mao Heyuan, and Wen Huazhou, etc., more than 1,300 people.</p>

<h3 id="e148">Chairman's Address <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Tang Hai'an was publicly elected as chairman, Mr. Fang Difei as master of ceremonies, and Zhou Fanglong and Zheng Cihe as recorders. After the meeting commenced as scheduled, the chairman gave an opening speech, briefly stating: "Today, we are holding the inauguration ceremony for our new association hall. We are deeply grateful for the presence and guidance of local officials, party representatives, and representatives from various organizations. In particular, the gathering of all the village leaders here demonstrates their public spirit and sense of justice; people share the same aspirations and principles. The people of Guangdong have an innate creative spirit, and are steadfast and hardworking in everything they do. Our association was established through perseverance and hardship. Our intention is not solely to seek material progress, but rather to use material progress as a means to further unite and strive together in spirit. We hope that our fellow villagers will live up to the expectations of the officials and representatives, and work together harmoniously for the benefit of the public. May our spirit be as strong in the future as it is today. The association will be most fortunate. As for the detailed process, there will be a separate report. We respectfully ask for the guidance of all the officials, representatives, and fellow villagers." Next, Huang Tianqu reported on the construction of the new association hall.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Mayor's Speech <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Subsequently, Mayor Wu delivered a speech, briefly saying: "I have been in Shanghai for twenty years, and people have always told me that the people of Guangdong should organize a fellow-provincial association. After many years of effort, it has finally been established. Now that Shanghai's commerce is in decline, the association has managed to purchase a hall, which shows that unity is strength. There are over 300,000 fellow provincials from Guangdong in Shanghai, and they have been able to establish themselves here. Senior figures such as Xu Yuzhi, Chen Huiting, and Tang Jingsheng have not only been able to create great enterprises, but also nurture future generations. Therefore, we should deeply respect them. In the early days of Shanghai's opening, starting a business was difficult. If we can achieve good results, we will certainly not fail the good intentions and virtues of our predecessors. Today, we cannot talk about individualism or regionalism; we should talk about collectivism and nationalism. Organizations such as the GuangZhao Public Hall, the Chaozhou Fellow-Provincial Association, and the Zhongshan Fellow-Provincial Association have inherited certain flaws, which must be eliminated. We must unify the will of the province and extend it to the entire country. Our country has thousands of years of civilization, and we should make the world understand the will and far-sightedness of our people. I hope that our fellow villagers will make even greater efforts." Afterward, Yu Zhiqing, Zheng Hongnian, Zheng Zhengqiu, Cui Tongyue, Wu Jishun, Chen Gongzhe, Wu Chengyu, Weng Ziguang, Cui Pingxi, Wu Jiangleng, You Yinqiao, and others successively gave speeches. The content of the speeches has been omitted due to length.</p>

<p>Congratulatory message from the Chaozhou Fellow-Provincial Association: "On this twenty-fourth day of the twelfth month of the twenty-second year of the Republic of China, the Shanghai Guangzhou Fellow-Provincial Association holds its opening ceremony. Having overcome numerous hardships, it has finally achieved success. With its foundation laid, may it widely extend its great undertakings, and forever enjoy boundless prosperity. We, on behalf of the overseas residents from the eight counties of Chaozhou, extend our congratulations. The message reads: 'We reflect on the ancients, who had a famous saying: "Respect and cherish one's hometown, let one's hair down and wash one's hat, and enjoy the local customs without forgetting one's roots." Our ancestors followed this path, embracing virtue and daring to lag behind. The depth of our kinship is the same now as in ancient times, especially for those of us living abroad, sharing the same deep waters. In this hub of trade, with its countless wheels and spokes, who stands out as a leader, the elite of the South? They reside and dwell here, proclaiming their good name, rightly so, as they each give their sincerity. It is in the association that their affairs can be modeled after. Be careful of its initial foundation, broaden its grand enterprise, manage it, operate it, and day by day, month by month, as many hands make light work, hardships are all forgotten. The towering edifice stands majestically on the banks of the Shanghai River, its reputation soars, standing firmly alone.'"

Finally, the music troupe of the Chaozhou Fellow-Provincial Association in Shanghai performed music in celebration. The chairman then gave a reply. The meeting adjourned at half past five with a group photograph.</p>

(15) In one's spare time after seeing patients, one should use what one has learned to promote medicine and hygiene. (16) There are many secret Chinese remedies that have been lost.

(17) Those who have no foundation in national medicine, imitate the superficialities of Western medicine, and boast of themselves as national medical scientists, their theories and prescriptions are neither fish nor fowl, and should be corrected together.

<p>Nearly 10,000 People Visited and Attended Lectures</p>
<p>Booklets and Forms Attracted Great Attention</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce publicly displayed improved Chinese bookkeeping in the chamber's meeting room at 2 p.m. yesterday for all sectors to visit. At 4 p.m., a lecture was held, attended by Wang Xiaolai, Sheng Zhuosan, Yan Esheng, and others. Wang Xiaolai, chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, gave an opening speech, and then invited accountant Xu Yongzuo to give a lecture, which lasted for two hours. The audience was not tired throughout. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Visiting Situation: The visit began in the afternoon, with over 50 types of account books, forms, and charts displayed. Each type had completed examples, and accountants Wu Huirong, Xiong Baozun, Ruan Xiting, Meng Wangqu, Zhang Huanjun, and important staff members Xu Hanqing, Pan Shihao, and Cha Yubo from the Xu Accountant Office provided explanations and guidance at any time. Many people from major commercial institutions in Shanghai, such as the Silk Industry Bank, Wuzhou Pharmacy, and Sanbei Company, went to study in detail one by one. From 1 p.m. to 6 p.m., no less than 10,000 people came to visit, a very grand occasion. Everyone expressed their admiration and appreciation for this improved Chinese bookkeeping.</p>
<p>Lecture Summary: The lecture by accountant Xu Yongzuo is summarized as follows: (1) Necessity of Improvement: (A) Evolution of Chinese Bookkeeping: Our country's arithmetic and accounting system originated very early. The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art and the establishment of officials and systems for accounting in government offices throughout the dynasties are recorded in history and can be verified. Bookkeeping was originally sharpened and promoted by arithmetic and accounting. Therefore, its long history can be imagined. The Book of Rites mentions "books and accounts" together, "accounts" meaning accounting, and bookkeeping was naturally something that should be learned when studying. Descending to the Song Dynasty, there was the system of "four-column registers," which made a significant contribution to bookkeeping. The completeness of its rules can be compared to Western double-entry bookkeeping. Chinese bookkeeping was actually completed with the four columns, dating back more than a thousand years. The completion of Western double-entry bookkeeping was only four or five hundred years ago. This is one of the most precious pages in the history of bookkeeping. Unfortunately, in our country, scholars and gentlemen are ashamed to talk about money and profit, and bookkeeping has rarely been requested. Therefore, progress has been very slow for over a thousand years. The transmission from teacher to apprentice often lost the essence, and each place had its own system and each industry its own method, resulting in disorganized organization and unclear rules. Since the introduction of Western-style bookkeeping in the late Qing Dynasty, the new business community competed to admire it, and Chinese bookkeeping was increasingly ignored by bookkeeping scholars. However, its history is deep, its application is wide, and it cannot be completely replaced by Western-style bookkeeping. Therefore, it can still maintain its considerable position today. (B) Advantages of Chinese Bookkeeping: Having examined Chinese bookkeeping, its important advantages can be summarized in four points: (1) Simple theory: Chinese bookkeeping can also be called the cash receipts and payments bookkeeping method. "Receipts" means the income of funds, "payments" means the expenditure of funds. Increases or decreases in assets and changes that need to be recorded can be used as the standard for recording and calculation in order, without the need to explore the principles of debit and credit as in Western-style bookkeeping. (2) Simple method: In various account books, ledgers, and forms, income items are recorded in the "receipts" section, and expenditure items are recorded in the "payments" section. This is the case for recording, posting, and closing accounts, unlike Western-style bookkeeping, which requires determining the nature of debit and credit accounts for transactions. (3) Popular and easy to understand: The Chinese vertical cash receipts and payments bookkeeping method can be understood by anyone who knows a little bit of reading and arithmetic. With a little instruction, they can record accounts, unlike Western-style bookkeeping, which requires a long period of study. (4) Savings in expenses: Paper, brushes, and ink are all made in China, and their prices are cheaper than foreign goods. Accounting personnel can be engaged in accounting after a little training. Various expenses are lower than those of Western-style bookkeeping. (C) Disadvantages of Chinese Bookkeeping: The advantages are as described above, but there are also not a few disadvantages. The main ones are four: (1) There is no fixed classification of accounts, and their nature is often unclear, inconsistent before and after, and there is no unified management. (2) There is no fixed organization of account books, and they are often reversed, disordered, and lack a system. (3) There is no fixed format for account books, ledgers, and forms, and there are no standards to follow when recording. (4) There are no fixed rules for accounting methods, and the recorder is free to do as they please. (D) Necessity of Improving Chinese Bookkeeping: Chinese bookkeeping is the bookkeeping with the longest history and the widest application in China. Since it has its own inherent advantages, its shortcomings should be improved to make it a perfect bookkeeping method. From the standpoint of sorting out national essence and advocating national products, it is also necessary to improve it. (2) Necessity of Improvement: (A) Three Prerequisites for Improvement: There are three prerequisites for the improvement of Chinese bookkeeping: (1) Scientific method: Bookkeeping is a science and must be organized using scientific methods in order to rationalize it. (2) Practical application: Bookkeeping takes practical application as a prerequisite, and the improvement plan must strive for convenience in practical use. (3) Savings in expenses: Accounting affairs cannot directly generate profits, so it is necessary to seek savings in expenses within the possible scope. B. Ten Major Guidelines for Improvement: Based on the above three prerequisites, ten major guidelines for improvement can be obtained: (1) Adopt the principles of modern accounting; (2) Maintain the original cash receipts and payments accounting procedures; (3) Maintain the existing cash receipts and payments accounting methods; (4) Use the four-column settlement method; (5) Determine the characters used to record numbers; (6) Stipulate the account and form formats for Chinese bookkeeping; (7) Determine the method of using seals in accounting; (8) Stipulate a systematic and orderly account classification; (9) Stipulate an organized and systematic account book organization; (10) Stipulate rationalized and disciplined accounting rules. C. Three Characteristics of Improvement: There are three characteristics of the improvement plan: (1) Cash receipts and payments accounting method, that is, all income items are recorded in the "receipts" section of the daily journal, posted to the "clearing ledger," and compiled into the "settlement statement." Expenditure items are recorded in the "payments" section of the daily journal, posted to the "clearing ledger," and compiled into the "payments" section of the "settlement statement." However, the direction of receipts and payments for cash accounts is reversed when posting from the daily journal to the clearing ledger and settlement statement. (2) Simple and unified accounting method: It is possible to avoid using the unified daily journal and general ledger or multiple account books, and there is another simple unified accounting method. (3) Strict four-column settlement algorithm: Its function for checking errors is no different from that of a trial balance, and its function for reporting accounting not only expresses the results of receipts and payments, but also expresses and compares the process of receipts and payments. (3) Improvement Process: A. First Stage: Before 1921, I only knew Western-style accounting and did not bother with Chinese bookkeeping. I used to plan accounting for various companies and always suppressed Chinese bookkeeping and praised Western bookkeeping. B. Second Stage: Between 1922 and 1923, after performing the duties of an accountant for many years, I gradually felt that Western-style bookkeeping was not convenient for the general public. On the one hand, I gradually came into contact with Chinese bookkeeping, and I felt that both needed to be improved. I advocated using Chinese account books, vertical records, and adopting Western-style accounting principles. That is, Western style is the body, and Chinese style is the use. At that time, it was advocated to maintain the vertical recording of Chinese bookkeeping, and the paper should be made in China. However, it was believed that the accounting principles and methods should adopt the spirit of Western style. C. Third Stage: Between 1926 and 1927, I gradually gained some understanding of the investigation and research of Chinese bookkeeping. I admitted that its accounting methods were not completely unreasonable, and its organization was not completely unordered. The shortcoming was that they were uneven. Therefore, I advocated improving Chinese bookkeeping based on China's inherent accounting methods and referring to the principles of Western double-entry bookkeeping. However, because it lacked the convenience of multiple rows or unified accounting, it was considered that it could not be used for large-scale businesses. D. Fourth Stage: In the past three or four years, there have been more and more designs for improving Chinese bookkeeping, and the effectiveness of implementation has gradually become apparent. At the same time, a simple unified accounting method and a strict four-column settlement algorithm were discovered and promoted to large-scale businesses, with remarkable results. Therefore, in order to promote popularization, I planned to compile a standard plan applicable to various industries. Therefore, from this year, I have rejected miscellaneous affairs and focused on this. I have compiled more than 30 types of improved Chinese account books and forms, and have also compiled a "General Introduction to Improved Chinese Bookkeeping" in two books, which were delivered to the Standard Account Books and Documents Manufacturing Office for printing and distribution.</p>

<p>200 Million Yuan of National Currency Has Leaked Out in the Past Ten Years</p>
<p>If No Remedial Measures Are Taken, the Future of the Coal Industry Is Worrying</p>
<p>Although China's coal industry has been in a state of sluggish sales due to traffic congestion and high freight rates, the dumping of foreign coal has a significant impact. If there is a plan to remedy the situation, the future of the coal industry is worrying. According to investigations, the quantity of imported foreign coal in the past ten years is headed by Japanese coal. Followed by Phan Rang, Vietnam, British, Russian, Korean etc. It is estimated that approximately 200 million yuan of national currency has leaked out, which is quite alarming. The quantity of imports over the years is as follows: 1,206,064 tons in 1922, valued at 11,312,855 Haikwan taels; 1,404,934 tons in 1923, valued at 13,267,838 Haikwan taels; 1,639,926 tons in 1924, valued at 15,476,995 Haikwan taels; 2,813,177 tons in 1925, valued at 26,707,324 Haikwan taels; 2,993,233 tons in 1926, valued at 27,909,714 Haikwan taels; 2,374,849 tons in 1927, valued at 22,878,110 Haikwan taels; 2,374,849 tons in 1927, valued at 22,878,110 Haikwan taels; 2,485,110 tons in 1928, valued at 23,171,382 Haikwan taels; 2,329,315 tons in 1929, valued at 460,595 Haikwan taels; 2,521,367 tons in 1930, valued at 25,467,041 Haikwan taels; 1,927,518 tons in 1931, valued at 21,782,191 Haikwan taels.</p>

<p>Wang Yonggen Died Amidst Laughter</p>
<p>Wang Yonggen, a native of Ningbo, was 46 years old. He worked as a tea server on a certain ship. Yesterday was the Winter Solstice Festival, and he was off work as usual. At around 2 p.m., he went to a friend's house at 672 Tiantong Road to play mahjong. Soon, he needed the "seventh bamboo." The player before him also needed the "fourth and seventh bamboo." The player after him needed the "seventh bamboo" and a "five pairs in a waiting hand." But the "seventh bamboo" never came. Then, Wang Shuigen suddenly drew the "seventh bamboo" himself, collapsing from excitement and laughing out loud. He then fell to the ground and died. The other players were shocked and immediately called the police. An ambulance was called and the body was taken to Tongren Hospital and then transferred to the coroner's office for examination.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Yuan Ludeng and Others Are Planning to Establish the Poyang Coal Mine Company <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>The Mining Area Is Located in Poyang County, Jiangxi</p>
<p>Capital Is 1.6 Million Yuan</p>
<p>| Daily Coal Output Can Reach 1,000 Tons |</p>
<p>Our country's mineral resources were originally very rich, but unfortunately, the Chinese people do not manage them themselves, and most of them are exploited by foreigners. Poyang County, Jiangxi Province, has a large mineral source. Shanghai merchant Yuan Ludeng and others have initiated the establishment of a Poyang Mining Company to carry out large-scale mining. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e164">Brief History of Operation <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>The mining area is located in the Hongmenkou area of Dongxiang, Poyang County, Jiangxi. It has extremely abundant reserves and is conveniently located, with no transportation difficulties. Originally, local wealthy merchant Fang Rensheng and others applied to the Ministry of Industry and Jiangxi Provincial Department of Industry to raise funds to operate and mine it. However, due to limited capital, the daily output of coal was only 30 to 40 tons. At the beginning of this year, Xie Tianxi, a shareholder of another nearby coal mine company, Poyang Le Coal Mine Company, obtained permission from the Ministry of Industry and signed an agreement with the Mining Department.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Establishing a Company <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai merchant Yuan Ludeng, Xie Tianxi, Jiang Bochang, and others believed that it would be a pity if the mine was not operated on a large scale. Therefore, they initiated the establishment of the "Poyang Coal Mine Company." They held a promoters' meeting at 1 Kangle Village, Fuxu Road, in Shanghai some time ago. As a result, the initial capital was set at 1.6 million yuan, and Xie Tianxi, Jiang Bochang, Yuan Ludeng, and others were appointed as members of the preparatory committee. Then, the first meeting of the preparatory committee was held, and Jiang Bochang and Xie Tianxi were re-appointed as standing committee members to organize the preparatory office and actively carry out all matters. Fang Rensheng was also appointed as the resident mine manager. It is estimated that after large-scale mining is implemented in the future, the daily output of coal can reach 500 to 1,000 tons.</p>

<p>Three Locations Reached Over 900 People in One Day</p>
<p>Including Those with Long Hair, Filth, and Smoking Habits</p>
<p>Funding Is Insufficient and We Hope All Sectors Will Contribute</p>
<p>The Shanghai Charity Federation establishes temporary shelters for the poor every severe winter to accommodate the poor, hungry, and cold masses, and disperses them at the beginning of spring the following year. This year's shelters began operating yesterday. Details are noted below:</p>
<h3 id="e167">Opened Yesterday <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>Some time ago, the association, due to the increasingly cold weather, contacted the heads of the Chaozhou Guild Hall, Dawang Temple, and ChaoHui Villa through directors Wang Yiting and Huang Hanzhi, requesting to temporarily use them as temporary shelters for the poor. They will be dispersed when the weather warms up in early spring next year, and the original sites will be cleaned and returned. The heads of the various places, as the matter concerns charity, all agreed, so the shelters were able to open as scheduled yesterday (the 24th).</p>
<h3 id="e168">Number of People Received <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, starting from 9:00 AM, the Dawang Temple, Chaozhou Guild Hall, and Chao Hui Villa began simultaneously receiving people. By 6:00 PM, the total number of people received at the three locations had exceeded 900, which is more than the number received on the opening day last year. This resulted in extreme congestion at the registration and inspection areas.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Condition of the Poor <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, among the poor received, most were orphans, those with no support, and the unemployed. The majority were dressed in filthy clothes with hair as long as artemisia. All were given baths and haircuts by the institution. Among them were some with sunken cheeks and emaciated appearances, addicted to smoking opium. Wang Yiting and Huang Hanzhi, two lay Buddhists, temporarily consulted with Zhou Chuliang, the director of the Shanghai Public Hospital, and arranged for a doctor to come to the institution daily to provide medication for treatment. At the same time, the administrators are engaged in persuasion, so that after being discharged, they will avoid falling back into a life of crime.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Insufficient Funds <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>However, this year, due to the depression of industry and commerce, there are many unemployed, and those seeking shelter will undoubtedly come in droves. This has resulted in a significant shortage of cotton clothing and blankets. Regarding fundraising, this year, due to the depression of industry and commerce, donations have not been very enthusiastic. Therefore, we hope that kind-hearted people in society will quickly understand righteousness and provide universal assistance. Please send all kinds of donations to Renji Hall on Six Malu Road.</p>

<p>On the Left Wall Outside the Factory Gate</p>
<p>The bomber fled the scene.</p>
<p>The Guangxin Dyeing Factory at No. 1070 Lujiabang Road in Nanshi has been in operation for many years. The entire factory only has three rooms. Although the scale is small, the business is very prosperous. All the dyeing machines, pressing machines, rubbing machines, drying machines, finishing machines, and all the arrangements are complete. There are nearly a hundred workers. The factory was initially established by Chen Tong and others as a joint venture. Recently, due to some reasons, on the 20th of this month, it was sold to a certain representative of Weichang Foreign Firm, and the brand name was changed to Fuxin Machinery Dyeing Factory, with Lu Yuntong from Shaoxing as the factory director. The day before yesterday was the day of the handover. At around 7:00 PM, Lu and others had just completed the takeover and were sorting out trivial matters when someone suddenly threw a bomb at the factory. It landed on the upper part of the left wall outside the factory gate and exploded immediately. With a loud bang, it shocked the vicinity. The bomber immediately fled the scene. The police chief Zhang Yaodong of the Sanguantang Police Station on Lujiabang Road, under the jurisdiction of the Second District General Office, rushed to the scene with a large number of police officers upon hearing the news. After inspecting the scene, they collected the exploded bomb shell and reported it to the Second District, which then reported it to the General Bureau for investigation.</p>

<p>At 5:40 yesterday morning, a fire suddenly broke out in the Changxing Milk Shed at No. 42 Hujiazhai in Xujiahui Town, West Shanghai. In an instant, it broke through the roof. A patrolling policeman spotted it, and the workers in the shed frantically blew whistles, all waking up from their dreams. They quickly rescued the dairy cows. Neighbors then managed to put out the fire. It is estimated that two tiled bungalows were burned down. Wu Youshan, the person responsible for the fire, was taken into custody by the Second Division of the Sixth District, pending investigation of the cause of the fire.</p>

<h3 id="e173">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Requests Revision of Specific Duty on Iron <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>Current tax rates are as high as 27 percent.</p>
<p>Causing foreign goods to be dumped, iron factories cannot survive</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday submitted a memorial to the Ministry of Finance, stating: "Presenting this memorial regarding a request: On the 22nd of this month, we received a letter from the Iron Industry Association stating, 'Copper and iron are daily necessities for the people. Agricultural and industrial tools, construction materials, all use these as the main raw materials.'"</p>
<p>"Related to people's livelihood and economy, it is extremely important. Our country does not yet have the means of smelting. Usually, we completely rely on imports. Now, at the time of construction, the demand is especially high. The customs tariff has always used 10 percent as the principle for taxation. As for machinery, in order to promote industry, it has been reduced to 5 percent. This is a good law and the intention is beautiful. However, since the 12th year of the Republic of China, the specific duty on various steel raw materials has gradually increased, while the ad valorem duty remains at the old rate. After the gold unit was revised the year before last, the conversion is even greater. Based on the latest tax regulations issued in May of this year, compared with the actual order value, some are levied as high as about 30 percent. This is extremely important to the national economy, people's livelihood, and economic construction. Now, we will list the uneven distribution of burden and the most important aspects in detail. According to Rule 187, scrap iron clippings and other fragments are taxed at 4 jiao and 4 fen of customs gold per dan, which is about 8 jiao and 4 fen in silver. However, the actual price is only about 4 pounds sterling per ton, which is about 3 yuan and 8 jiao in silver per dan. Calculated as a percentage, it must be 22 percent. Also, according to Rule 207, scrap iron and sections cut from new goods are taxed at 5 jiao and 5 fen of customs gold per dan, which is about 1 yuan and 5 fen in silver. However, the price per ton is also only 4 pounds sterling, which is about 3 yuan and 8 jiao in silver per dan. Also, according to Rule 208, old iron scrap iron, only suitable for reproduction, is taxed at 4 jiao and 1 fen of customs gold per dan, which is about 7 jiao and 8 fen in silver. However, the price per ton is only about 3 pounds sterling, which is about 2 yuan and 8 jiao and 5 fen in silver per dan. All are above 27 percent. However, according to Rule 176, short cooked strips, etc., which are taxed based on ad valorem, the fixed rate is still 10 percent. The difference between them"</p>
<p>"Is nearly two times. The tax on whole iron is lighter than that on broken scrap iron. This is the first unfairness. The aforementioned three items of scrap iron, waste iron, broken iron, etc., are all fragments of steel and iron materials, specially used by various iron factories and blacksmith shops to manufacture various light machine parts, ironware, building materials, agricultural and industrial tools, and the needs of the people's daily necessities. The application is most frequent and the sales are widest. However, now the tax is above 20 percent, while according to Rule 214, finished building materials, etc., are only taxed at 15 percent. This means that manufacturing utensils and transporting them to China for sale is taxed less, while the raw materials that have not been made and are broken and old are taxed more. This not only"</p>
<p>"Creates the opportunity for dumping foreign goods, but also makes it impossible for domestic industry to develop and compete. That is, various building materials, machinery, utensils, etc., can never be imitated. Because the raw material tax rate is heavier than the finished product, even if it is made, the cost is heavier. How can it be sold at the same price as foreign goods? It is appropriate that industry is extremely advocated, but it is ultimately useless. This is the second unfairness. Also, according to Rule 183, the tax regulations for new iron bars, etc., have been reduced to 5 jiao of customs gold per dan, which is about 9 jiao in silver. The current price per ton is about 5 pounds sterling, which is about 4 yuan and 8 jiao in silver per dan, worth about 18 percent. However, the sections of Rule 207, scrap and sections cut from new goods, that is, the materials cut from these new goods that are not up to standard, and the materials that are discarded from foreign factories, are completely useless abroad and are shipped to China. However, now the tax is heavier than the complete new goods of raw materials. The contradictions are reversed. This is the most extreme. The intention is to lighten the tax on new goods because they are needed for construction and encourage their import. I do not know that China's industry has not yet developed. Usually, what is needed is mainly broken pieces, which are cheapest and most suitable. Moreover, all alterations to building objects and imitations of iron agricultural tools rely entirely on these broken segments, and what China does not have is taxed heavily, while the example of reducing complete new goods is"</p>
<p>"Unclear of the intention. This is the third unfairness. Furthermore, in terms of the tax rate regulations, the same iron goods should have the same tax rate. Generally speaking, new and complete ones should be heavier than old and broken ones. In terms of needs, the raw materials that are daily necessities should be lighter than the manufactured utensils. Even in terms of protecting industry and commerce and promoting construction, light taxes should be levied on what the country does not produce and relies on to supply everything, in order to promote manufacturing. Heavy taxes should be levied on what domestic industry can produce and is sufficient to prevent dumping, in order to benefit the people's livelihood. Moreover, those taxed ad valorem are mostly rare and uncommon items, so it may be slightly heavier, while those taxed specifically are necessarily daily and commonly seen items, so it should originally be lighter."</p>
<p>"Now, the original and the branch are reversed, making the raw materials on which agriculture, industry, commerce, people's livelihood, and daily necessities rely for manufacturing twice as heavy as complete new goods, and the same iron bars are light on new and complete, but heavy on broken and discarded. This is the fourth unfairness. Furthermore, in terms of actual situation and theory, the steel tax rate was originally 10 percent as the most accurate. Then, for the three items of scrap iron in Rules 187, 207, and 208, since they are necessary for civilian industrial use, the tax should originally be lighter than the new goods in Rule 183, and taxed at 10 percent of the actual price, which is in line with the principle. At most, it should be equal to the finished products in Rule 214, and taxed up to 15 percent, and it must not be more than 50 percent of the new goods in Rule 183, then the budding industry may still have a line of life. Now, at the time of promoting industrial construction, old steel"</p>
<p>"Scrap iron is most frequently used. There is no domestic product, and all rely on imports. It should be the same as millet, beans, cloth and silk, with the same tax rate and extra light. Now, on the contrary, it is cutting its own life, making it impossible to imitate, and advocating for foreign goods. This is the fifth unfairness. There are many other imbalances in the tax regulations on various steel, iron and hardware goods, but these few items are the most important, and they are all related to the main presentation of people's livelihood industry. In recent years, the iron industry has been extremely depressed, which may not be due to heavy taxes. Only because it concerns the national treasury, we have to reluctantly transport it, so we have been accumulating difficulties for a long time, and we have never made a request to reduce taxes. If it is beneficial to the country, we originally did not want to make any requests. However, business is declining day by day, accounts are difficult to collect, and iron factories and handicraftsmen are seen to be collapsing one after another, and there is no room for survival. Profit rights are overflowing, and leakage is increasing day by day. There is no way to save it. Even the various handicraftsmen, the utensils and tools needed by the agricultural and industrial workers, must also rely on foreign goods. Even the slightest of a knife and a chisel can hardly be made by themselves, let alone others. As a result, there are more and more unemployed, the customs are declining, and the people's livelihood and economy are even more unbearable to ask. The national economy also bears its disadvantages, especially with our industry and commerce,"</p>
<p>"The future development of all industries has a close relationship and a huge impact. Merchants live here, and their knowledge is deeper. They dare not block it from above, and they are by no means merely seeking private interests. The lightness and heaviness of the tax rate are linked to the fullness and emptiness of prices. The cost increases, and the selling price also increases. Therefore, although the harm to merchants is obvious, the loss is still shallow. The pain to the people is great, and the concern is even deeper. Now, I heard that there will be a revision of the tax regulations in January next year. For this reason, I have selected several types of iron goods with the most important imbalances in taxation, and narrated the actual situation in detail. I hereby request that the Ministry of Finance approve the transfer of customs tax regulations 187, 207, and 208, the tax rates of scrap iron, waste iron, old iron, and other agricultural and industrial building necessities, be reduced first, and according to the actual value,"</p>
<p>"Taxed at 10 percent to benefit the people's livelihood and relieve business difficulties," etc., have arrived at the meeting. According to the current import tax regulations, there are 16 items of steel taxed ad valorem, among which only 181 railway turnouts and turntables are taxed at 5 percent, and the remaining 7 items are taxed at 15 percent, and the rest are taxed at 10 percent.

<p>Gu Zongxing, the owner of Yong Ping An Chang Tai Cosmetics on Ningbo Road, was kidnapped by bandits on Fuxu Road and Tongfu Road at 9:00 AM on October 8th of this year and held for ransom. However, Gu's family did not report it to the police. Gu's cousin, Zhou Yifu from Shaoxing, took the initiative to contact the bandits. As a result, he was redeemed for 4,000 yuan. This matter was discovered by Lu Liankui, the Chinese inspector of the General Inspection Office of the General Patrol Room, and detective Feng Zhiming. They immediately led detectives Zhang Yunhong and Wu Hanzhang to arrest Qian Xingquan, one of the kidnappers in the case. Qian confessed that the case was a conspiracy between Zhou Yifu and his son, Sheng San. Sheng San was also at the scene of the kidnapping, and Zhou Yifu pretended to be a representative to negotiate. The detectives then arrested the Zhou father and son and handed them over to the First Special District District Court for interrogation. The trial has concluded and they are awaiting sentencing. Yesterday morning, Feng Shide, the head of the criminal court, announced the sentence: Qian Xingquan and Zhou Sheng San were each sentenced to 20 years in prison, and Zhou Yifu was sentenced to six years in prison as a warning.</p>

<h3 id="e176">Hu Xiyuan Proposes Prompt Implementation of Industrial Production Control <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>This year's market situation has declined, and various industries have withered, which has not been seen in decades. Since the Minbian, the commercial environment has become even worse, and the suffering suffered by national goods factories is the deepest. A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency yesterday visited Hu Xiyuan, a figure in the industrial circle, and asked him about his observations on the recent industrial environment. Mr. Hu said that at a time when the whole world is rejecting Japanese goods, the Chinese market has become the only dumping ground for Japanese goods. Our industrial circles are not only unable to resist foreign enemies in unison, but also various industries are engaging in meaningless competition. Because there is no statistics on industrial production, Japanese goods that have been changed in disguise take the opportunity to mix in. The market situation of various industries has become even more chaotic and impossible to clean up. He believes that if various industrial colleagues can sincerely connect, wholesale raw materials, and unify production, the cost can be greatly reduced. Then, a large part of my country's industrial products may not be able to resist Japanese goods. Therefore, Mr. Hu has proposed to the Industrial Research Committee of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, requesting the government to promptly promulgate industrial production control regulations to manage various industrial productions. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce has already passed the drafting, and if the government can approve its implementation, there may still be a glimmer of dawn for the future of my country's industry.</p>

<p>Zhang Yi's speech at the YMCA the night before last</p>
<p>The night before last, the YMCA in Eight Immortals Bridge invited Zhang Yi, a professor at Fudan University, to speak on the Pacific in 1936. Bingxun Stenography Company recorded the general idea, saying that Japan's position in 1936 would inevitably fall into isolation because (1) the conflict of interest between the United States and Japan was very strong, (2) the atmosphere between Russia and Japan was tense, (3) France is now wooing the United States and must be lukewarm with Japan, and (4) Britain will also have conflicts with Japan in order to maintain colonial interests. In 1936, if there is a war in Europe, Japan will inevitably take the opportunity to annex China. If a war breaks out in the Far East, although Chinese land will be ravaged, there may be a way out. Finally, he said that the Chinese people are not competitive and buy foreign goods, resulting in the outflow of money. As a result, various countries actively expand their military forces to seize our country's interests and turn China into a battlefield. The entire people of our country cannot shirk their responsibility for the results. It is true that they harm themselves.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Soybean and Rice Industry Warehouse Completed <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>Storage has already begun at the request of the industry</p>
<p>The Shanghai Soybean and Rice Industry Association, in view of the needs of adjusting the people's diet and facilitating the application of the industry, designed and planned to build a warehouse in May of this year. The construction was contracted by Jiu Ji Construction Factory and started on the industry's base on the Bund outside the Santai Wharf. It has been half a year and was fully completed at the end of last month. The committee of the industry reviewed and accepted it, but the Yancheng Wharf has not yet started construction. It is heard that it will also be carried out. The warehouse is three stories high and is entirely made of steel, concrete, and clay bricks, so it is very strong and magnificent. Live glass air windows are also installed around it, so the interior is brighter and the air is more sufficient. The facade faces north and has the words "Shanghai Soybean and Rice Industry Warehouse Built in the 22nd Year of the Republic of China". Below is a spiral-type discharge ladder, which is high and condescending, to take convenience and agility. On both sides are flat-level escalators that can lead directly to the third floor. Closer to the outside are two warehouse doors. The doors are made of thick copper plates, and the style is extremely exquisite. As for the internal facilities, each floor is divided into two warehouses, and each warehouse has Yuan, Heng, Li, and Zhen subdivisions, and each warehouse has a capacity of more than 25,000 bags. Therefore, the entire warehouse can store more than 160,000 bags. Fire protection and fire extinguishing products are placed in all important places inside and outside the warehouse. The entire warehouse is equipped with meticulous details. On the side facing the Bund in the east, a western-style facade water tower is built for various colleagues as business institutions. The Santai and other lines have already rented places, but the two corner rooms are the office of the warehouse management office, which is equipped with a reception room, accounting room, and manager's office. As for the selection of the warehouse manager, it is heard that Cai Yukun has been determined by the industry committee to take the responsibility. Now the warehouse is at the request of various colleagues, to the point that this new valley is coming out, and rice and grain from various places are arriving very quickly, so it has begun to store in advance. It is heard that in the past five or six days, rice and grain from various places have arrived in Shanghai and stored more than 50,000 or 60,000 bags.</p>

After the ceremony, the discussion of various cases began as follows: (1) The Wuxian and other associations seconded that the tooth tax collection offices in various counties are all hosted by recognized merchants.

It should be requested that the Department of Construction be asked to postpone the implementation (Resolution) The facts will be forwarded immediately. (3) The term of office of the members of this association has reached two years, and according to the regulations, it should be re-elected immediately.

<p>The case involves Liu Shikui, a staff member of the Municipal Public Security Bureau</p>
<p>Liu Shikui, a staff member of the Second Section of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, suddenly went to the Household Registration Office of the First District and Second Precinct on the 19th of this month and told Chen Shusheng, the patrol officer there, that Xu, a Fujianese who works in a certain place under the Municipal Government, is well known to me. Xu has a fellow villager named Xu Yong'an, who lives in the Danfeng Road area. He has recently had important matters and plans to return to his hometown. Because he is carrying several pieces of luggage, he is afraid of being extorted and harassed by a group of hooligans at the pier. Therefore, he asked Xu to entrust me to take care of him. Because I did not know Xu's address and he would be taking a ship in the next few days, I came here to ask the patrol officer to check Xu's detailed address so that I could go and contact Xu, etc. Chen patrol officer immediately flipped through the household registration book and found that Xu Yong'an's house was located at No. 106 Danfeng Road. I will lead you if you want to go to answer. Section staff Liu replied that there is no need to trouble you. Please send a police officer to lead me there. Chen patrol officer then dispatched police officer Fang Liming to accompany Liu to Danfeng Road. At the same time, Liu also asked Chen to send a police officer to escort Xu to the pier when he goes to take the ship. Chen also agreed. Then, police officer Fang Liming led section staff Liu to the front door of Xu's house at No. 106 Danfeng Road. Later, he saw Liu enter, and police officer Fang returned to the station. Until the next day, Xu Yushu from No. 106 brought a child and several pieces of luggage, and police officer Fang escorted them to the pier. After seeing Xu and others step on the Shenyou ship docked at the Pudong, Fang bid farewell and returned to the station. Until about 4:00 PM the day before yesterday, Wen Hongen, the director of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, received a secret report that Xu Yushu from Fujian was carrying a child on the Shenyou ship to Fujian to sell, etc. When the matter concerned trafficking in people, he immediately secretly ordered the Supervisory Office to send service personnel Lin Peng and Chen Tongming to join the water patrol captain to rush to the Pudong side of the South Wharf and board the Shenyou ship to inspect. They then found a man carrying a child in the cabin of the ship, which was very suspicious. They questioned him. They learned that the man was Xu Yushu. According to Xu, he is 41 years old this year, originally from Xinghua, Fujian Province, and currently lives at No. 106 Danfeng Road in Shanghai. The child's name is Mei Mei, and she is five years old this year. I bought her from Suzhou at my own expense. Now I plan to take her to Fujian to sell. I have notified the Municipal Public Security Bureau and the Municipal Government, etc., and Liu Shikui, a staff member of the Second Section of the Public Security Bureau, also knows, and a police officer was sent to escort us here to board the ship. After he finished speaking, he took out a piece of section staff Liu's name card. After the officers read it, they took Xu and the child along with Liu's name card to the water patrol team. Director Zhu took the case for preliminary interrogation and handed over the witnesses to the Public Security Bureau for handling. Director Wen believed that the case was very important and it was necessary to send personnel to investigate the facts closely before further investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e182">Apprehension of Robbers Who Shot and Wounded Three Police Officers in Huatongfang <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>Three Robbers Arrested in a Linchun Teahouse</p>
<p>At 7:40 AM on the 3rd of this month, several armed robbers broke into the home of Zhou Bocheng, a Yangzhou native residing at No. 4 Huatongfang, North Xizang Road. They brandished pistols, demanding silence, and robbed 20 yuan in paper money and two gold rings. As they were searching for more valuables, the Hongkou police station received a report and dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to apprehend them. The robbers, alert and cunning, forced their way out and fled wildly through areas like Manzhou Road and Kulun Road in Zhabei. Police officers No. 2073 Zhang Liankui, No. 2062 Zhou Peixin, and No. 2213 Liu Qingxin attempted to stop them. The robbers opened fire to resist arrest, shooting and injuring the three officers, who fell to the ground one after another, allowing the criminals to escape. Zhang, Zhou, and Liu were taken to Baolong Hospital by ambulance for treatment, but Officer Zhang succumbed to his injuries at 1:00 AM on the 8th. Subsequently, Hongkou Police Detective Shi En, along with Detective Bao Shuji, apprehended Zhou Maoxian (47 years old, from Yancheng), Lin Xiaogui (34 years old, from Qingjiang), and Wang Weichun (34 years old, from Yancheng), the robbers involved in the case, at the Linchun Teahouse on Jiujiang Road. Zhou confessed that a Mauser pistol with three bullets was hidden on the rooftop of No. 4, Lane 245, Kulun Road. Detectives secretly went there, along with detectives from the Fourth District Public Security Bureau, and retrieved the gun from under the roof tiles, taking it back to the police station for safekeeping. Yesterday, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated that investigations revealed the group had gathered beforehand in room 27 of the Wuzhou Hotel on Guangdong Road to plan the robbery. They reconnoitered the area near Zhou's residence to identify escape routes and then went armed to carry out the robbery. The victim, Zhou Bocheng, and his wife, Ms. Yi, were still asleep when Zhou Maoxian and Lin Xiaogui went upstairs, using the pretext of searching for opium to wake the Zhou couple. They claimed there were 2,000 yuan in cash and demanded it be handed over quickly. They took two gold rings from Ms. Yi's fingers and 20 yuan in paper money from Zhou's wallet, but feeling it was not enough, they continued to search. When the police detectives arrived, the group took the opportunity to flee into the Chinese-controlled area, opening fire on the police as they escaped. The three defendants admitted at the police station that they went to rob the Zhou family of their property. Zhou confessed to firing several shots, knocking down the three officers. Lin and Wang denied firing the gun. The two stolen gold rings were hidden by Zhou at the residence of his mistress in Zhangjiaxiang village in Zhabei and have since been recovered. Police detectives recovered three bullets and three bullet casings at the scene of the incident on Manzhou Road and Kulun Road. The Western firearms expert, Ying Na, confirmed that they were fired from the recovered Mauser pistol. Yesterday, the victim Zhou Bocheng, rickshaw puller Wang A'er, and hotel tea servers Chen A'sheng and Wang A'jin all appeared in court to testify. The gun, bullets, and gold rings were presented for inspection. After hearing the testimony of the victim and witnesses, and the verification by Western expert Pang Na, defendant Zhou Maoxian readily admitted his guilt. Lin Xiaogui claimed he did not have a gun, and when escaping north from Manzhou Road in Zhabei, there was still a person named Wang in their group who was behind them. He heard gunshots. Wang Weichun admitted to going along with the robbery, but he did not enter the residence. After a while, he hired a rickshaw and fled from the Xiaocaichang area of Gongyi Lane in Zhabei. The remaining statements were evasive. Judge Wu Zehan ordered them to be remanded in custody for further investigation at a later date.</p>

<p>Ni Shunrong, a villager near Baoxin An in Loutang, Jiading, had a modest family fortune. He married Ni Lu as his wife. Initially, they lived peacefully. However, in the spring of this year, Lu was seduced into an adulterous affair by Huang Baosheng, who lived nearby. As their passionate affair deepened, Huang Baosheng dared to bring a sharp blade on the night of May 17th (lunar calendar) and hid in Ni's house, plotting to murder Ni Shunrong so he and Lu could be together forever. That evening, Ni Shunrong entered the room, intending to sleep, when he heard a noise in the corner. He became suspicious, lit a lamp, and suddenly saw Huang Baosheng crouching there with a knife. Ni was terrified and shouted for help. Neighbors, thinking it was a fire, rushed over to investigate. Huang Baosheng, seeing that his plan had been exposed, ran away and disappeared. Afterward, Ni reported the incident to the local police station, who arrested Huang. After Huang was released upon completion of his prison term, Huang colluded with Lu and on August 21st (lunar calendar) they packed up and fled together. Ni Shunrong searched everywhere and eventually found Huang Baosheng and Ni Lu hiding at No. 2 Bianjiazhai in Jiangwan, living together as husband and wife. Ni reported this to the Fifth Precinct of the Fifth District, who sent police to the address. They arrested the adulterous couple in the bedroom and handed them over to the local court for interrogation. Huang Baosheng was sentenced to eight months in prison, and Ni Lu was sentenced to five months in prison, as a warning to others. Meanwhile, Ni Shunrong filed a lawsuit with the court, requesting a divorce, citing her adultery and fleeing, even plotting with her lover to murder him. He argued that if they were to continue living together, his life would be in danger. The court held a mediation hearing. Ni Lu stated that her husband wanted to take a concubine and also disliked her appearance. She did not want a divorce. Therefore, the mediation failed, and Ni was advised to file a formal lawsuit. Ni Lu was sent to prison to serve her sentence. It has now been learned that Ni Lu has appealed the criminal court's verdict to the local court, which has accepted her appeal and scheduled a hearing for January 6th.</p>

<p>▲The Popularity of Xuan Paper Cards Chinese Xuan paper is highly regarded by countries around the world, with even Sweden admitting its inferiority. This is a great honor for our country. It is a pity that its high price prevents it from being widely used. The Shanghai Family Industrial Cooperative has commissioned the paper mill to produce four-foot-wide imitation Xuan paper suitable for couplets, and after being mounted in multiple layers as cards, they are even more beautiful than Xuan paper from Anhui. The New Year's cards used by Mr. Bolede, the Customs Commissioner of the Jianghai Customs, are made of this imitation Xuan paper, which has been praised by everyone who has seen them. Therefore, Chinese and Western people in the customs are competing to order prints from the cooperative. The use of imitation Xuan paper for cards is changing fashion. The Customs Commissioner has indeed made a contribution to promoting it, while our Chinese people are using Western paper instead, which is rather embarrassing in comparison.</p>

Mr. Hong has a deep friendship with Lawyer Jiang Yiping, so his office is also located in Lawyer Jiang's office on Sichuan Road to take advantage of cooperation. From now on, the peony and green leaves will complement each other well. (2) The office of Lawyer Jiang Teping was formerly located at No. 527, 5th Floor, Mainland Commercial Field, Nanjing Road. Because the address was too small and insufficient, it has now been moved to No. 625, 6th Floor of the commercial field. His legal affairs are also moving to a higher level, so he is very busy.</p>

<h3 id="e200">Ministry of Education Releases Report on Inspection of Six Shanghai Universities <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>Jinan University has worked hard to reorganize after the war, and is now gradually returning to its original state.</p>
<p>The spirit of running schools at Datong and Hujiang Universities is infused, and the Business School of Fudan University is developing well.</p>
<p>There is overlapping of departments and enrollment at each school, enrollment is not very strict, and many students are extravagant.</p>
<p>Previously, the Ministry of Education ordered Chen Kezhong, editor of the National Compilation and Translation Bureau, Zhang Shaozhong, professor at National Zhejiang University, and Xie Shuying, section chief, to go to Shanghai to inspect six universities: Jinan, Datong, Hujiang, Fudan, Guanghua, and Daxia. The aforementioned personnel have completed their reports and submitted them to the Ministry of Education. The following is an excerpt of the main points of the original inspection reports. It is also heard that the Ministry of Education has copied and distributed the reports and highlighted key points, ordering improvements.</p>
<p>1. National Jinan University</p>
<p>The school suffered considerable losses during the Shanghai war. After the war, it worked hard to reorganize, and is now gradually returning to its original state. It is organized into three colleges: Liberal Arts, Science, and Commerce, with fifteen departments. The administrative section has 115 staff members. The organization is considered too large, and the number of staff members is also considered excessive. The annual income is more than 697,000 yuan. After offsetting expenses, there is still a surplus. However, there are still more than 200,000 yuan in accumulated old and new debts. There are 143 faculty members, which is a slight increase compared to the previous inspection of full-time faculty, but is still considered insufficient. There are 872 students, with the College of Liberal Arts having the most. Military training and physical education are taken relatively seriously. However, the students' clothing is not plain, especially the female students. There are more than 50,000 books in the library, with some new additions in recent years. Scientific experiments are mostly improved in accordance with the Ministry's orders, and equipment has also increased slightly. The newly established printing house is performing well. Other sports and health equipment are quite sufficient.</p>
<p>2. Private Datong University</p>
<p>The school campus occupies 103 mu. The buildings are somewhat old, but still usable. A gymnasium and faculty residences have recently been added. A library and science hall are also planned for construction. There are 20 staff members, 22 full-time faculty members, and 13 part-time faculty members. There are 334 students. All students in each college are required to take mathematics, physics, and chemistry courses. The equipment in the College of Science is relatively complete. The school is managed economically and does not waste money. Faculty members are hardworking and dedicated. Students are simple and eager to learn. It is particularly valuable for teachers to guide students to conduct research independently. Last year's final budget showed an income of over 126,000 yuan, but expenses resulted in an annual deficit. The school is organized into three colleges: Liberal Arts, Science, and Commerce, with two attached specialized courses in English and mathematics. The duration of study and admission requirements for these courses do not meet the regulations. The curriculum arrangement is quite relevant. However, it is difficult to have university and middle school courses taught by the same professor at the same time. Students pay attention in class and have very few absences. All kinds of examinations are strictly administered. There are more than 24,000 books in the library. There are occasional feelings of lacking instruments, but overall, it is considered complete.</p>
<p>3. Private Hujiang University</p>
<p>The school campus occupies more than 300 mu. The buildings are complete and the environment is excellent. It is organized into four colleges: Liberal Arts, Science, Commerce, and Education, with a total of 14 departments. However, the names of some departments do not comply with the Ministry's regulations, and some departments have few students. The Department of Religion and Ethics does not have any specialized students. The annual income is more than 290,000 yuan. After offsetting income and expenses, there is still a surplus. The school's finances are absolutely transparent, and the budget is very stable, so there have been no deficits over the years. There are 45 staff members and 54 faculty members, all of whom are full-time. They are absolutely not allowed to hold part-time positions outside the school, and the school provides housing, so their lives are stable, they are diligent in their duties, and their spirit is extremely focused. There are 541 students. Discipline is good. Management is strict. Examinations are taken seriously. Extracurricular activities are also given great attention. However, everything at the school tends to be Europeanized, and students are accustomed to extravagance, especially female students. The Chinese language proficiency of first-year students is too poor, and even sentence construction is not fluent. This is because attention was not paid during enrollment. Books and instruments are quite complete, especially the equipment, talent, and teaching conditions of the College of Science, which are the best among the universities inspected. Sports, health, and other equipment are very complete and clean. The medical office is also well managed.</p>
<p>4. Private Fudan University</p>
<p>The school campus covers an area of 80 mu. The environment is very good. There are libraries, gymnasiums, health centers, and dormitories. A scientific laboratory is under construction. It is organized into four colleges: Liberal Arts, Science, Law, and Commerce, with 18 departments. There is also an attached normal school department. This is considered too large, and it is not easy to develop given the school's financial resources. Last year's final budget showed an income of over 1,189,000 yuan, but income and expenses could not be offset, resulting in continuous debt. There are 56 staff members, 17 full-time faculty members, and 79 part-time faculty members. Part-time faculty members account for about 80% of the total, which is far from the Ministry's prescribed ratio. There are 1,369 students. The Business School is developing well and is managed relatively successfully. The school's curriculum places too much emphasis on the credit system, so students' grades are often indistinguishable. The curriculum arrangement needs to be improved. Semester exams and school-wide final exams are relatively serious. Training and management are also strict. All first-year students live on campus and are given special training by designated teachers, which is especially appropriate. There is a lack of books, instruments, medicines, and equipment needed for various experiments. Other facilities, such as sports and health facilities, and the Business School's practical training facilities, are considered complete. In particular, the health center, a small-scale hospital, is managed even more successfully.</p>
<p>5. Private Guanghua University</p>
<p>The school campus covers an area of more than 100 mu. Libraries, science halls, gymnasiums, and auditoriums are still planned for construction. It is organized into three colleges: Liberal Arts, Science, and Commerce, with 13 departments. The annual income is 306,000 yuan, and the expenses are the same. However, there is a considerable amount of debt from the past. There are 29 staff members, most of whom are part-time. There are two vice-presidents, making it difficult to divide authority. Each college does not have a formal dean, but is instead headed by the department chair. Some deans hold administrative positions in other cities, or department chairs teach courses at other schools, or hold important positions at other schools. However, the school president has made considerable efforts to raise funds and maintain the school. Vice-President Zhu is also working hard. The registrar's office has a new and simple method for assessing student performance, and only two staff members are responsible for it, which is particularly economical. There are 60 faculty members, with full-time and part-time faculty members each accounting for half, which is not very appropriate. There are 689 students. Students in each college pay attention to basic subjects such as Chinese, foreign languages, and mathematics, which is quite appropriate. Faculty members mostly use English to teach. Examinations are not strict. The equipment in the Department of Physics in the College of Science is too simple, and the courses offered are not sufficient for major students. The equipment in the Department of Biology is sufficient for first-year students. Various books and equipment for basic science experiments are considered insufficient. Training and extracurricular activities are given attention. Students are mostly extravagant and Europeanized, especially female students' attire.</p>
<p>6. Private Daxia University</p>
<p>The school campus covers an area of 300 mu. The buildings are suitable and the environment is excellent. It is organized into five colleges: Liberal Arts, Science, Law, Commerce, and Education, with 15 departments. There is also an attached normal school specialized course, divided into four departments. The annual income is over 1,281,000 yuan. Income and expenses are currently balanced, but there is a considerable amount of debt from the past. The school has limited financial resources and too many departments, making it difficult to develop. The management of the Business School has not been successful. It is also inappropriate to have four departments in the normal school specialized course. There are 76 staff members and 76 faculty members, with too many part-time faculty members. There are 1,425 students. Classrooms are shared with the middle school, which is very insufficient. The cooperative spirit between faculty and students is very good. The College of Education is managed relatively well. The spirit of joint research between teachers and students is especially good. Training and management are considered serious. However, students' customs tend to be extravagant, and female students are even more frivolous. Chinese and Western books are not abundant. The lack of physical and chemical instruments and medicines is particularly serious. Sports and health equipment are sufficient.</p>
<p>In summary, the six schools inspected this time all have colleges of Liberal Arts, Science, and Commerce. Daxia and Fudan have colleges of Law, and Hujiang and Daxia have colleges of Education. Even if other schools do not have these colleges, they mostly have departments similar to these colleges. In Shanghai alone, there is such an overlap of university colleges and departments. It is impossible to seek overall development, whether in terms of economics or talent. Rather than having a large organization and engaging in extravagance without any development, it would be better to cut back and merge separately, reduce the scope, and seek special development. Therefore, the issue of colleges and departments in Shanghai universities really needs to be systematically reorganized by the government or by the schools themselves through voluntary joint efforts.</p>
<p>According to the current survey results, Datong and Hujiang Universities are the most dedicated to running schools. Hujiang and Datong Universities also manage the College of Science better. Daxia University manages the College of Education better, and Fudan University manages the Business School better. As for Guanghua University's recent reorganization and Jinan University's post-war reorganization, each has made considerable efforts. However, Guanghua University's administrative organization is not very sound, and the spirit is quite scattered.</p>
<p>The regular income of each school, except for Jinan, is at most just over 200,000 yuan per year, and at least only over 100,000 yuan. Given the specialization of university courses and the breadth of equipment, which require a lot of money, it is necessary to implement extremely economical methods in terms of expenses. The abuses of public schools, such as the misuse of staff and the waste of public funds, are rare in private schools. Except for Hujiang, all private schools are experiencing extremely difficult financial situations, but the school authorities do not slack off in their spirit, and even plan day and night to seek the development of school affairs. Their dedication to the cause and their hard work are admirable.</p>
<p>Except for Hujiang, each school has had deficits over the years, ranging from tens of thousands of yuan to two or three hundred thousand yuan. This is all due to insufficient funding. Due to insufficient funding, they often recruit more students and charge higher fees, and hire fewer full-time faculty members and pay lower salaries. Although each school plans to repay the deficits every year, it is ultimately futile. If this continues, it will be difficult to maintain. It is hoped that the central government can allocate some funds each year, select those with excellent performance, designate their use, and provide appropriate subsidies to show encouragement. Moreover, most of these private universities lack funds, and even if they do have them, the amount is very small. It is also hoped that each school will seek to remedy this on its own as soon as possible.</p>
<p>All faculty members at Hujiang are full-time. In other schools, part-time faculty members account for a large number. At Fudan, part-time faculty members account for 80%. According to the faculty rosters of each school, some teach at several schools, some serve as department chairs at two schools, and some even hold positions in other cities. Since their energy cannot be focused, teaching will naturally be inefficient. It is already insufficient to simply impart knowledge through lectures, let alone train talents and conduct research. If this is not improved, the impact on students' studies will be significant.</p>
<p>The enrollment issue is not very strict at most schools. This year, the percentage of applicants and those admitted at each school is slightly lower at Hujiang, and very high at the rest. It is even possible to enter university with a forged certificate after graduating from junior high school. If qualifications can be strictly reviewed and entrance exams can be seriously administered during enrollment, then these students will have no way to get by.</p>
<p>Most schools lack books and scientific experimental equipment. Many books are old or scattered and lack a system. There are limited new additions each year. The experimental equipment at Datong and Hujiang is sufficient and can be fully utilized, but it is still not complete. Jinan is still purchasing equipment due to the impact of the Shanghai war. The rest of the schools only have simple equipment for basic subjects. Even important courses that require experiments lack experimental equipment, so students have no practical experience.</p>
<p>Except for Hujiang, most schools' graduation theses are too narrow in scope. Some even plagiarize books and perfunctorily fulfill their responsibilities. Students do not actually benefit much. In the future, theses at each school should focus on practical research and explore specialized problems, so that students can gain practical experience and develop methods for independent research.</p>
<p>Among the schools' students, Datong's clothing is relatively plain. Most others are accustomed to extravagance and luxury, competing for novelty in clothing and shoes, and tending to be weak in physique. They even go to entertainment venues and are deeply influenced by current habits. This fact has been reported in newspapers many times. Female students' clothing is even more luxurious and novel. If this is not corrected, a simple and strong atmosphere will not be cultivated, and both families and society will suffer.</p>
<p>Regarding students' knowledge, during the inspection, representatives of the student self-government associations of one or two schools were selected for conversation, and asked what preparatory work students should do during the national crisis. They were also asked for their opinions on national higher education policies and the specific plans of the self-government association to lead students. The students were unable to answer. After a long time, they began to express their opinions, but they were mostly empty, superficial, and impractical. Each school should pay special attention to the educational work of clarifying shame and fighting the war, and reviving the nation, so as not to betray the fundamental purpose of university education.</p>
<h3 id="e201">Educational Development in Shanxi Province <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>Compulsory education is most universal</p>
<p>Normal school students receive special treatment</p>
<p>There are scholarships for entering middle school and university</p>
<p>| Remarks after inspection by Supervisor Gu of the Ministry of Education |</p>
<p>After Gu Zhaoluo, supervisor of the Ministry of Education, returned to the ministry after inspecting education in Shanxi and other provinces, he said that Shanxi's methods for popularizing compulsory education are cost-effective and have significant results, and other provinces and cities can follow them by law. He also talked about several special features of education at all levels, which are described separately below.</p>
<p>▲Compulsory Education　Shanxi Province is the most developed and universal province in terms of compulsory education for elementary schools. When Director Ji of the Shanxi Provincial Department of Education took office in the 21st year of the Republic [1932], there were 5,000 out-of-school children in the provincial capital. Now there are only more than 1,000 out-of-school children. Not only is this the case in Taiyuan City, but in rural elementary schools such as Dai County, there are now only more than 100 out-of-school children. These more than 100 people, and the more than 1,000 people in Taiyuan, are all because the students' families are too poor and need to find other ways to help. Generally, ordinary families can go to school. The reasons are: (1) elementary schools do not charge tuition fees; (2) they do not charge accommodation fees; (3) meal fees are very low, only about one yuan and a few cents per month. A student who receives a complete elementary school education only needs to pay a total of about 20 yuan per year, including meals, accommodation, books, and supplies. Moreover, the village administration in the province is very well managed. There is a system from top to bottom, which also provides a lot of assistance for the popularization of compulsory education. Director Ji of the Department of Education also set up five experimental elementary schools. The experimental schools are divided into three systems: (1) regular classes; (2) short-term classes; (3) simplified classes. This adjustment also makes it easier to promote compulsory education. Generally, society is skeptical of short-term and simplified classes. Since a school has three systems, students with poor qualifications can enter short-term or simplified classes, and outstanding students can be promoted to regular classes. Teaching students according to their aptitude can dispel society's doubts and fulfill their wishes. This method can be followed by various provinces.</p>
<p>▲Secondary Education　(1) The province originally had six normal school districts. The most peculiar thing is that the classes in the normal schools outside the provincial capital are not connected, especially for female normal schools. The Department of Education plans to merge the first three years of normal school into middle school to run the first three years of general middle school, and set up separate normal schools for the last three years. (2) The funding for middle schools, except for Taiyuan City, is relatively abundant. The funding for middle schools outside the province does not have a fixed standard, especially for girls' schools. The Department of Education is drafting a draft funding standard, which has not yet been finalized. It is expected that next year, there will be a standard for middle school funding to follow. (3) There are no senior high schools for girls. Except for a few private senior high schools that occasionally admit girls, there are no senior high schools for girls inside or outside the province, so girls have fewer opportunities for further education. This year, the Department of Education took over the private Guanghua Girls' Middle School and renamed it the Provincial Taiyuan Girls' Junior Middle School. In the future, it plans to add a senior high school to enable girls' education to be further developed. (4) The most special phenomenon in the province is that girls' education is not developed. There is one girls' middle school and five girls' normal schools in the province, and the number of students is not large. In the girls' normal school classes, the class with the fewest students has only six to eight students per grade. The social psychology of the province generally does not want girls to go to school more. According to this situation, in the future, the province may reduce the number of girls' normal schools and add girls' normal school classes in boys' normal schools to save money.</p>
<p>▲Higher Education　(1) Shanxi University in the province was established during the Guangxu period [1875-1908]. It has the longest history and is similar to Beiyang University. It has three colleges: Liberal Arts, Law, and Engineering. The annual expenditure is 272,314 yuan, which is currently paid at 80%. The school was national during the former Beijing Ministry of Education era. After the establishment of the National Government, the Ministry of Education ordered it to be changed to provincial. However, the general faculty and students are still seeking to restore the national movement. The reason they hold is that the central and local taxes are not clearly divided. Part of the funding is provided by the province, and part is paid by the national treasury. There are currently 700 male and female students. The affiliated high school also has several hundred students. Previously, the Ministry of Education ordered the merger of the private Law and Education colleges due to the duplication of departments. The reason why they have not been merged to this day is that the funding standards are different, and it is not easy for the province to raise additional funds (420,000 yuan after the merger). Also, the faculty and students of Shanxi University, in order to seek the restoration of the national movement, believe that merging the private Law and Education colleges and proceeding with nationalization would be inconvenient, so they are not enthusiastic about the merger. The school spent a lot of money when it was established, so the campus and equipment are quite impressive. However, the annual fee is only more than 20,000 yuan per month, and it must be paid at 80%. Since it includes three colleges, the recent equipment has not increased significantly. The College of Engineering has departments of machinery, electrical engineering, and civil engineering. President Wang is a specialized scholar, so graduates of the College of Engineering have made considerable achievements in serving the province (such as the design and construction of provincial roads by graduates of the College of Engineering). The library equipment of the Colleges of Liberal Arts and Law and the existing classics are sufficient for use, but the reference books for application need to be expanded. (2) The Industrial Specialized School merged the Industrial Experimental Institute and the Model Factory into the school when Xishan retired in the 20th year of the Republic [1931], so the machinery is better equipped. The production of magnetic and kiln smelting can produce high-temperature flasks, and the results are good. There is also machine leather production, and the products are of good quality. However, due to the lack of marketing methods, it has not been possible to sell them for maximum profit. (3) The Commercial Specialized School and the Agricultural Specialized School are generally well managed, but the equipment is slightly lacking. (4) The private Bingzhou College has departments of Liberal Arts and Law, and more than 400 students. This year, a Department of Chemistry was established, and it is initially able to follow the central government's approach to focusing on science. Although it was registered during the former Beijing Ministry of Education era, it has not gone through the registration procedures in modern times. (5) The private Chuanzhi Medical Specialized School has good equipment, and President Jin is also able to work hard. The affiliated midwifery department is very successful. Most of its graduates serve as military doctors, and few practice medicine privately.</p>
<p>Vocational Education　Vocational education in the province has been unsuccessful because the A and B vocational industrial and commercial schools that were previously run were not effective, and there was no way out after graduation. Society is very skeptical of vocational education, and the plans formulated by educational administration have not taken vocational education into account, so it has not been established. After discussing the situation with the Ministry of Education supervisor, the most important principles were determined as follows: (1) Promote vocational education. Without increasing education fees, by the 26th year of the Republic [1937], vocational education funding will account for 35% of secondary education funding standards. (2) According to Yan Xishan's ten-year construction plan, there are local special products (such as animal husbandry, salt affairs, etc.), but new-style industries and the manufacture of products are insufficient, whether manual or mechanical, resulting in little success in management. It is necessary to find ways to improve them. It is also important to cultivate students' technical skills and work habits. After discussion, the education community in the province has gained the courage to try. According to Shanxi's production situation, the new industries in the future will be centered on Taiyuan, because the original arsenal and paper mill are concentrated in Taiyuan. If a vocational industrial school is set up here, there will be no shortage of students, and it can be distributed throughout the province, and the so-called special production can be carried out in parallel. Special production will be centered on the local area. (3) The establishment of departments and methods for vocational schools in the future, as well as the issue of teachers, has been generally discussed, but has not yet been decided. According to Shanxi's lack of junior technical talents, it is necessary to widely establish vocational supplementary schools in the future, followed by junior vocational schools. It is not necessary to establish many senior vocational schools, but the teachers of vocational schools are very important. If technical teachers can be carefully trained, it seems better than training many normal school students who explore academic theories.</p>
<p>▲Scholarship Methods　Those who enter normal school in the province, whether it is the pre-term general science or the post-term normal science, receive a meal subsidy of five yuan per month. Students actually eat for two yuan and a few cents, and the remaining two yuan and a few cents per month can be used to purchase school supplies. This is the preferential treatment for normal school. Those in ordinary middle schools and universities have scholarships. Each county has a sum of money set aside for students from the county to go to school. Counties with good results (that is, fewer students going to school can be allocated more) can receive a subsidy of 70 to 80 yuan per person per year. Counties with poor results can also be divided into 30 to 40 yuan. This refers to going to middle school in the province. If they go to specialized schools or higher outside the province, they can receive a subsidy of 70 to 80 yuan from the county at the same time, and a subsidy of more than 100 yuan from the province. Therefore, those who go to school outside the province pay very little private money themselves. This scholarship method can be said to be uniquely excellent. However, because the departments in higher education in the province are duplicated, those who go to school in Beiping mostly enter departments of Liberal Arts and Law, and only one in ten enters science and engineering departments, which is due to their usual teaching. This is the whole problem of Shanxi education. After this inspection by the Ministry of Education supervisor, the Department of Education also knows that there is a bias in the education of the whole province, and will have new plans to reorganize it.</p>

<p>All Three Major Lianghua Generals Were Penalized and Ejected</p>
<p>Fudan Still Failed After Overtaking</p>
<p>Pucheng Soundly Defeated by Hujiang</p>
<p>The Lianghua from Tianjin and the Pucheng from Goryeo basketball teams played their second game last night at the China Basketball Stadium, one winning and one suffering defeat. Although Lianghua defeated Fudan University by a score of thirty-nine to thirty-six, in the last four minutes, Lianghua was once surpassed by Fudan with a score of thirty-three to thirty-six. After extreme danger, Lianghua barely overtook with a score of thirty-seven to thirty-six, and finally won with a score of thirty-nine to thirty-six. The battle between Pucheng and Hujiang was one-sided. Pucheng was soundly defeated by thirty-four to fifty-six.</p>
<p>Lianghua's Victory Was Not Easy</p>

<p>After the start of the game, both sides were unstable for a while. Tang Baokun was the first to score. Zhao Butian penalized Yin Hongxiang, and Fudan also scored one point. Lianghua's Xiao Tang and Liu Zhenyuan scored one after another, making it eight to one. Then Lianghua took the upper hand and was not caught up by Fudan. The difference was always around ten points. Although Fudan had opportunities, they missed their throws. Heart and wish are contrary. The first half ended with a score of twenty-four to seventeen.</p>
<h3 id="e218">The Storm Started From There <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>Although Lianghua was seven points ahead, the situation was very bad. Liu Zhenyuan and two defenders had already accumulated three foul records and could be penalized and ejected at any time. Sure enough, in the second half, when the score was twenty-seven to twenty, Liu Zhenyuan, one of the main generals of Lianghua's forwards, was penalized and ejected for four fouls. From then on, Lianghua's crisis was immediately apparent, and the entire line fell into chaos. Scoring was difficult, and the opponent's offense became more intense. Fortunately, Xiao Tang presided over the entire army, which was still able to maintain it.</p>
<h3 id="e219">Fudan Suddenly Surpassed <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>The situation changed dramatically. Fudan moved closer step by step, getting closer and closer, thirty-three to thirty-two, only one point behind. At this critical moment, Zhang Jingbao, the main defender of Lianghua, was again penalized and ejected for four fouls. Zhao Butian made two of two free throws, and then chased out with a score of thirty-four to thirty-three. The hero Zhao Butian scored eight points in a row during this period. Lianghua was completely panicked by this major change and did not know what to do. Time was extremely short, and it seemed very difficult for Lianghua to get up.</p>
<h3 id="e220">The Situation Suddenly Changed Again <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>There were still four minutes left until the end of the game. Who knew that the situation would suddenly change again? Fudan's Zhang Jinxiang was penalized and ejected. Xiao Tang scored one point on a free throw. Before long, Fudan's soul Zhao Butian was also penalized and ejected. Lianghua could not help but overtake one point with a score of thirty-seven to thirty-six. Suddenly, Xiao Tang was also penalized and ejected. However, there were only dozens of seconds left in the situation. Lianghua finally threw the ball in the whistle, ending the game with a score of thirty-nine to thirty-six.</p>
<h3 id="e221">The Performance Was Not as Good as the Day Before <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>Lianghua's performance was not as good as the day before. In the first half, they were slightly panicked due to too many penalties and lost a lot of their grip. After Liu Zhenyuan was penalized and ejected, they had a feeling of being without a leader. The lack of experience is the reason. There were too many fouls on both sides, which was a shortcoming. Fudan lost too many opportunities in the first half, and it was the same at critical moments. Otherwise, they could have won. Referees Shen Guoquan and Zhou Jiaqi.</p>

<p>In the battle between Pucheng and Hujiang, Pucheng was soundly defeated by a score of thirty-six to fifty-four. However, with Hujiang's wonderful performance, it did not lose its interest due to being one-sided. Pucheng used a hard-hitting method against Hujiang, who had both soft and hard skills, so there was no development and no way out. Until Hujiang scored twenty-one points, Pucheng's Song Quanyu opened the record. The first half was thirty-one to ten. In the second half, Pucheng worked hard to fight, and the final result was fifty-six to thirty-four. In the middle, Sun Bide's long shots hit several times in a row, which was quite difficult. This achievement is also worthy of self-consolation. Referees Shu Ming and Zhou Jiaqi.</p>

<h3 id="e229">Foot Fungus Problems <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— Pang Jingzhou</p>
<p>Foot fungus is a common ailment among people in southern China. It manifests as intense itching between the toes, white maceration, peeling skin, small blisters, oozing yellow fluid, and a foul odor. In some cases, it can even spread to the dorsum and sole of the foot, leading to ulceration and difficulty in walking. Because it feels more comfortable after the fluid is released, it is commonly referred to as "dampness." The small holes that appear in the dermis during the initial peeling stage of the blisters are why it is also called "foot rot."</p>
<p>According to traditional medical theory, this is a way for "dampness" to exit the body. Having it means you won't develop a more serious illness. Patients themselves often say it's one of life's great pleasures. In the mild to moderate stages, soaking the feet in hot water every night feels very comfortable. Or, having a pedicurist scrape the affected area with a metal blade every few days, scraping until blood comes out and the itching stops, can also create a feeling of complete relaxation.</p>
<p>However, in our view, even if "dampness" is a euphemism for some kind of disease, the body already has sweat pores, the bowels, and the urinary tract as excretory mechanisms for releasing dampness. To deliberately create a blood-soaked path on healthy skin for the smooth flow of dampness hardly seems to be the intention of nature in creating humans. Furthermore, people in the north rarely suffer from foot fungus. Does this mean they don't need to release dampness? Why is it that southerners, who sacrifice their flesh and blood to release so much dampness, are still prone to contracting damp-heat illnesses that northerners don't? How can this be explained? The fact is that medical experts haven't recognized what foot fungus really is, nor do they know how to guide the "dampness" released from the feet to the proper channels of urination, defecation, or sweat pores for excretion. Thus, they have concocted a specious theory that has deeply poisoned people's minds. Initially, people even harbor the disease, thinking it beneficial, a clear case of mistaking a thief for a father. Later, seeking relief from the itching, they resort to hot water and metal blades, unknowingly forming a habit. This then turns into a fondness for crusts, like the untalented eccentric Jin Shengtan, who said, "Leaving one or two sores on the private parts to scratch in secret is a great pleasure." Who would have thought that, three hundred years later, his followers haven't diminished in number. But think about it, everyone, is there any difference between scratching sores on one's private parts in secret and a beggar delousing himself in the sun? Why must civilized people seek pleasure in such a state?</p>
<p>An investigation reveals that foot fungus is a skin disease caused by a parasitic organism, specifically a type of fungus. These fungi are commonly found in the air. If they attach to human skin and the environment is suitable, they will develop, grow, and cause disease. (For example, people with sweaty feet are prone to developing it between their toes because the environment is suitable for the fungus.) It can spread from the toes to the hands, causing similar symptoms. This fungus is not unique to China, but it is more prevalent in southern China and warmer regions, such as Southeast Asia and Hong Kong. Foreigners in Hong Kong first discovered this condition, and therefore they named it "Hong Kong foot." It is less common in colder regions because the climate is not conducive to the fungus. The fungus dies off, and the disease cures itself. To put it simply, foot fungus is a type of "tropical infectious skin disease."</p>
<p>I myself have suffered from this disease and have been cured. It has recurred, and I have cured it again. (Actually, it wasn't a recurrence, but rather a re-infection. These things are common in the air, and they often lurk inside old shoes. If you suddenly wear shoes that haven't been worn for a long time and you happen to sweat a lot, it can happen again. But as long as you wash your feet diligently after being cured, it's unlikely to return.) I feel that after this disease was eradicated, I did not develop any other ailments. There was truly no difference. Moreover, I have cured countless others. I believe that a compound ointment I concocted based on the cause of the disease is very effective. Those who have been cured have also reported to me that "there's no difference." Among them, a few honestly said, "Because the itching between my toes has suddenly stopped, I feel a bit unaccustomed for a short period of time. But I haven't developed any other serious illnesses."</p>
<p>However, those who advocate the theory of "dampness exit" have one compelling piece of evidence: "Whenever someone with foot fungus suddenly stops oozing fluid, they often develop a fever or become ill, or even become seriously ill and bedridden, and the foot fungus actually improves. These are all undeniable facts." However, this is a case of reversed causality. It is because a person is about to become ill that the foot fungus stops oozing fluid, due to changes in the skin's resistance to the fungus. When a person is already ill, it stops oozing even more, for the same reason. As for being bedridden for a long time, naturally one is lying flat and barefoot, without the constraints of shoes and socks, and without sticky foot sweat. The toes are ventilated and dry, which is most unfavorable for the propagation of this fungus. Just look at farmers who often work barefoot in the fields. They are exposed to a lot of dampness, yet they don't develop foot fungus. Consider friends who wear sandals in the summer. Their foot fungus can also cure itself. Doesn't this disprove the theory of "dampness exit"? There is no shortage of bold individuals in society. Please try curing your foot fungus and see if you develop any serious illnesses. Then the truth of medicine will be clear.</p>
<h3 id="e230">Discussing the Effect of "Day and Night" on Human Physiological Functions <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Yanggao</p>
<p>Doctors in the past did not conduct much research on this aspect because scientific knowledge about the specifics of natural cycles was limited. In recent years, however, significant progress in climatology has gradually clarified the relationship between medicine and this issue. In reality, common folk experience has already proven certain facts, such as the influence of weather on temperament and general ailments. However, these observations could not be explained using scientific methods. These phenomena are abundant not only among the Chinese populace but also among various ethnic groups worldwide.</p>
<p>In the natural world, apart from humans, we have long recognized such relationships. For example, certain plant blossoms only open at night (night-blooming jasmine), while others close at night. The French botanist Lmno called this phenomenon the sleep of flowers, stating that we can use this phenomenon to observe time, making it a "floral clock." Its accuracy is evident. Our common people also know of such phenomena, such as recognizing the start of spring when plum blossoms bloom. These instances prove the relationship between the life activities of plants and the cycles of nature. Their actions change accordingly. Germans call it Kosmische BceuiＩussg auf des Lebeu. In the animal kingdom, we know that the physiological functions of many animals have an inseparable connection with the lunar cycle. In the ocean depths, there is a type of spiny-haired worm whose mating season invariably coincides with a fixed period of lunar change, without deviation (the specific period is unknown to the reporter at the moment). In short, we can point out close relationships in both the plant and animal kingdoms. It is not surprising to find similar phenomena in humans.</p>
<p>Human physiological functions also exhibit this type of phenomenon. For example, we desire to be awake during the day and to sleep at night; to be active when awake and to rest when asleep. This is a natural cycle. According to Eores, humans are awake during the day and asleep at night because the visual organs are the primary organs, so they must be awake when stimulated by sunlight and sleep during darkness. Birds, whose primary organs are also their eyes, also share the same sleep-wake cycle as humans. Animals like dogs differ from humans because their primary organ is their sense of smell. These facts are apparent to everyone. Although we have electric lights and other industrial inventions that provide light, working at night is never as enjoyable as working during the day, and one always feels more fatigued in the evening. Some who work at night have conducted experiments, letting themselves wake and sleep at will during the day. But even after long-term trials, they could not achieve the same joy and lightness of working during the day. Therefore, the reason for sleeping and waking lies in the distinction between day and night, and not entirely in daytime overexertion that necessitates nighttime rest.</p>
<p>Besides the sleep-wake cycle, there are other cyclical physiological functions, such as the fall of blood pressure, stimulation of the respiratory center, decline in libido, and decrease in heart rate. The acidity in the blood increases in quantity due to respiration. The excretion of phosphorus compounds in the urine also increases accordingly. All of these are closely related to nighttime sleep. Moreover, temperature changes also follow a cyclical pattern. Old theories often attributed the rise in temperature at dusk solely to the impact of daytime work. However, this notion can no longer be sustained. Experiments conducted with long-term (eight-year) night workers explain that the rise and fall in temperature is a natural response, following a cycle, and cannot be entirely eliminated by other actions. Similar to this temperature cycle are the excretion of urine volume (the lowest volume at 12:00 AM, the highest in the forenoon) and the discharge of liver and gallbladder glycogen.</p>
<p>Besides the various physiological functions mentioned above, there are certainly other, as-yet-unexplained examples. Human physiology functions in accordance with the ideal of Reaksfoneu u·Gegenreaksicnen (reaction and counter-reaction). So, there might not be a single human physiological activity that isn't closely related to day and night. The ultimate control of various cycles, of course, resides in the brain, especially the Hypophysen Lwischenhirnsyssem (midbrain system). There is clinical evidence to support this assertion. Nevertheless, there is a specific region in the human body responsible for controlling such cycles. However, we must also consider whether this discovered function originates internally or is stimulated by external factors. The latter explanation is feasible. We can use animal experiments to prove that the root cause lies entirely in the effects of "sunlight" and "darkness." These two conditions are the driving force behind this cyclical pattern. In reality, we must consider that day and night do not fundamentally occur simultaneously at all points on Earth. And when people reach nighttime in their respective locations, they all exhibit the phenomenon of fatigue. Is this not a clear piece of evidence?</p>
<h3 id="e231">Common Knowledge Questions and Answers About Diseases <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>(22) Pleurisy</p>
<p>(Q) What part of the body does pleurisy affect?</p>
<p>(A) Pleurisy is one of the most common diseases of the respiratory system. It is an inflammation of the pleura, which covers the outside of the lungs and the inside of the chest cavity.</p>
<p>(Q) What are the causes of pleurisy?</p>
<p>(A) There are many causes: some are primary, such as colds or injuries. Others are secondary, often following tuberculosis, pneumonia, rheumatic arthritis, peritonitis, pericarditis, and various infectious diseases.</p>
<p>(Q) What are the general symptoms?</p>
<p>(A) It often starts with mild chills and fever. Pain develops in the chest on the affected side, radiating from the affected area towards the side of the chest, the back, or the abdomen. Frequent coughing occurs, but without phlegm. The patient's pulse rate increases, the complexion becomes pale, the body feels tired, and the appetite decreases.</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>(Q) What are the different types of pleurisy?</p>
<p>(A) There are dry, wet, and purulent types.</p>
<p>(Q) What is dry pleurisy like?</p>
<p>(A) In dry pleurisy, breathing movements are limited on the affected side of the chest. Percussion produces a high-pitched sound, and auscultation reveals friction rubs. The patient prefers to lie on the healthy side. If the inflamed area is near the diaphragm, percussion may not reveal friction rubs, but there will be pain in the hypochondriac region, which intensifies when swallowing.</p>
<p>(Q) What is wet pleurisy like?</p>
<p>(A) Wet pleurisy involves a large amount of effusion, causing the affected area to swell. Breathing is uneven on both sides. The apex beat of the heart is compressed and shifts towards the healthy side. The position of the liver and spleen is also affected. The patient often lies on the affected side. Percussion produces a dull sound in the affected area, with a slightly tympanic sound above the dullness. As the effusion decreases, auscultation reveals friction rubs on the upper border of the dullness. Fever fluctuates with the amount of effusion. The amount of urine also decreases. As the effusion is absorbed, urination increases.</p>
<p>(Q) What is purulent pleurisy like?</p>
<p>(A) When pyogenic bacteria invade and cause pleurisy, the effusion becomes purulent. This is purulent pleurisy. The patient often develops a high fever accompanied by intermittent chills, fatigue, headache, and rapid pulse. Chest pain is severe. Because adhesions of the pleura are rare, bronchial sounds can often be heard.</p>
<p>(Q) What is the prognosis of pleurisy and how dangerous is it?</p>
<p>(A) Dry pleurisy is usually not dangerous, but it often leads to pulmonary tuberculosis. Wet pleurisy depends on the amount of effusion and the age of the patient. Most cases are tubercular and cannot be completely cured. A large amount of effusion can be life-threatening.</p>
<p>(Q) What are the dangers if the effusion is not absorbed?</p>
<p>(A) If the effusion remains for a long time, it will form a hardening, causing adhesions of the pleura, leading to atrophy. If the atrophy is extensive, the chest wall will become flattened, and the spine will curve towards the affected side.</p>
<p>(Q) What diseases can develop after exudative pleurisy?</p>
<p>(A) Chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis, and thoracic neuralgia can develop.</p>
<p>(Q) What are the treatments for pleurisy?</p>
<p>(A) Complete bed rest is essential. It is important to pay attention to cardiac function and administer cardiotonic drugs. If coughing is severe, narcotics such as codeine can be given. For fever, antipyretics are used. For pain, local application of warm cloths or poultices is used. For rheumatic pleurisy, salicylates can be administered internally. For chronic pleurisy, iodides are used. Diuretics are used to promote the drainage of effusion, or thoracentesis is performed to aspirate the retained fluid. However, thoracentesis is contraindicated in hemorrhagic pleurisy. When there is pus in the chest cavity, thoracotomy is necessary.</p>
<h3 id="e232">How to Enhance Our Health and Longevity <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— Guo Renji</p>
<p>If we can strive for hygiene and physical fitness in our daily lives, we can achieve strength and health. As a result of health, we will inevitably attain longevity.</p>
<p>Do those who hear this doubt my words? Those who have trained their physique have stronger bodily functions than the average person. Therefore, their resistance to disease is stronger, and their ability to recover is also stronger. Unless the invasion of an external disease is overwhelmingly powerful, they will not fall ill. Even if they do fall ill, those who die are few, and they will recover quickly.</p>
<p>Suppose two individuals suffer the same injury. If one is an athlete, they will heal quickly and without a trace. If one is elderly or weak, granulation tissue will not form easily, healing will be slow, and suppuration is likely to occur. The wound will not heal easily, especially in cases of tuberculosis. The resulting scar will also be unsightly.</p>
<p>There are also cases of injury or disease without presenting symptoms. Mr. Pettenkofer once swallowed a pure culture of Vibrio cholerae, conducting his famous self-experiment. Because of his strong digestive function, even with concentrated Vibrio cholerae in his intestines, he proved that it would not trigger cholera (severe cholera).</p>
<p>It is not uncommon for acute infectious diseases such as typhoid fever or influenza to spread within a family, and yet one person remains unaffected. That person is usually someone who is fully healthy and very active. This is a common experience.</p>
<p>The above are all examples of the body's ability to overcome disease. Unfortunately, a very virulent pathogen may invade, and even the strongest person may not be able to resist and will die prematurely. Therefore, if we wish to achieve longevity, we must strive for hygiene and physical fitness in our daily lives. We must improve all bodily functions and become strong to broaden the scope of our lives.</p>
<p>Looking at the statistics on mortality and causes of death reported by various civilized nations in the East and West, the largest causes of death among humans, besides infectious and digestive diseases, are diseases of the respiratory and circulatory systems, accounting for about a quarter of all deaths. However, these organ systems can generally be strengthened through hygiene and exercise. Therefore, those who focus on physical education and have strengthened these functions are not as afraid of these diseases.</p>
<p>However, gastrointestinal diseases account for more than 15% of deaths. In the past, some argued that athletes had shorter lifespans, which warrants attention. However, this argument was based on observations of martial arts athletes. The training methods of athletes in that transitional era were not yet standardized, and they did not know about hygiene. Occasionally, some of them died prematurely in succession, leading to alarming pronouncements to attract attention. It is known that when they were in their youth, they often overindulged in food and drink, and their training was irregular or overly intense. During competitions, they relied on their natural physical strength, thinking it would last forever. During this period of vigorous physical activity, they could easily digest large amounts of food and did not show symptoms from excessive drinking. However, when they gradually retired from the athletic world, they did not change their bad habits and continued to overeat and drink excessively, while exercise had stopped. As a result, they succumbed to disease and died prematurely. This is a common occurrence.</p>
<p>However, this does not happen to today's scientific athletes. They never overeat and strictly adhere to a very regular lifestyle. They understand that failing to observe hygiene and neglecting training will ultimately prevent them from achieving good results. They constantly strive to strengthen their bodies and maintain their health. Therefore, sports figures in the East and West have never suffered from such calamities.</p>
<p>We practice strengthening methods, continue to maintain our strength and health, and eventually achieve a natural death, which is to die of old age. This is called longevity. Unnatural death is called premature death. Among unnatural deaths, some are suicide, poisoning, or injuries that suddenly attack the body. Most diseases can only invade the body when our health is reduced or when we are in an unhealthy state. A person in perfect health will not fall ill unless their health is first impaired. It is as if there is a barrier or trench between them and disease, acting as a defense.</p>
<p>There are various causes of unnatural death. Some originate internally:</p>
<p>Heredity. Mental derangement. Functional derangement. Other unknown causes.</p>
<p>Some originate externally:</p>
<p>Temperature. Humidity. Poisoning. Trauma. Fungi. Parasites.</p>
<p>There are also other unknown factors.</p>
<p>These causes may be singular or multiple, internal and external factors interacting, or death may be caused by only one factor. The time between the appearance of the cause of death and death itself is called Necrobiose "indirect tissue death." The duration varies. In the case of trauma, it may take only a few seconds. In the case of chronic infections, it may last for decades.</p>
<p>During this time, our body vigorously activates various functions to defend against or expel diseases. Lymph and white blood cells actively circulate. Blood serum swirls. The liver performs its functions. Endocrine glands increase their activity. As a result, phenomena such as redness, swelling, suppuration, fever, sweating, and secretions manifest.</p>
<p>If these resistance and defense mechanisms are successful, Necrobiose will cease, and the individual will return to their previous state of health. These defensive and resistant functions are even stronger in generally strong and healthy people.</p>
<p>The outside of our body is completely covered by skin or mucous membranes. If a person is in perfect health, there are no cracks in the body's surface, and pathogens cannot invade. It is as if these external enemies are all repelled beyond the borders. However, it is difficult for the body's surface to be completely free of cracks. Therefore, external enemies can easily enter the country and disrupt peace. However, pathogens generally lack the ability to move on their own. Some are completely unable to move without assistance. If we do not deliberately open the door and invite them in, they will not be able to invade. Those who are good at nurturing life should pay close attention to this.</p>

<h3 id="e234">The Four Stages of Improving Chinese Bookkeeping <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Yongzuo</p>
<p>Although I (the author, referring to myself) studied accounting bookkeeping in school, my focused research began after 1919 or 1920. At that time, I was the chief editor of the "Banking Weekly." To facilitate discussion among enthusiasts, I started a "Accounting Research" column in the newspaper, briefly outlining my views. During this period, my research focused entirely on Western double-entry bookkeeping, and I advocated it with unwavering conviction. I believed that Chinese accounting books were upside down, chaotic, fragmented, and of no research value. I advocated complete abandonment and adoption of Western horizontal-style bookkeeping. When planning accounting systems for various companies, I also followed this approach, as exemplified by the accounting books for the stock exchange. This was the first stage of my efforts to improve Chinese bookkeeping. My advocacy was purely for Western double-entry bookkeeping, and my implementations were all in large-scale modern enterprises. I had no accurate understanding of Chinese bookkeeping and was no different from the general proponents of Western bookkeeping today.</p>
<p>Around 1932, having practiced as a certified public accountant for several years, and realizing that Western bookkeeping was not easily understood by the general public and that complete imitation was inconvenient, I considered the following: Firstly, switching to Western bookkeeping meant relying on imported supplies, which were expensive and difficult to procure, making it an undesirable improvement strategy. Secondly, when submitting an audit report to the court for a certain case, the judge requested a separate report because he was unfamiliar with Arabic numerals. This showed that adopting Western bookkeeping had its obstacles. However, I was still reluctant to abandon Western bookkeeping, so I made slight modifications to the format, such as changing horizontal writing to vertical, using Chinese characters for all records, and listing amounts in Chinese characters while omitting place names between each number, such as tens, hundreds, thousands, etc., using lines or dots to separate the place values. I used domestic paper for the accounting books and a brush for recording. I subsequently planned accounting organizations for a certain chamber of commerce and two universities, based on this approach. Those who used it found it convenient. When planning the accounting organization for a certain chamber of commerce, I originally intended to have both horizontal and vertical styles, but the vertical style was ultimately adopted for its convenience. However, the accounting principles and methods were all based on the Western style, which was not easily learned by the general public. The numbers were written neatly within grids, which was not conducive to quick writing. The accounting books required a specific format and special printing, which was difficult to replenish. All these factors hindered its promotion in commerce and industry. This was the second stage of my efforts to improve Chinese bookkeeping. Even today, many government accounting systems still use this method for improvement. However, at this stage, I only maintained the form of Chinese bookkeeping, while still leaning heavily towards Western bookkeeping in terms of content.</p>
<p>In 1925 and 1926, realizing that it was difficult to promote Western-style bookkeeping in China, and that the improvement plan of maintaining the form of Chinese bookkeeping also had many obstacles, I had more contact with the commercial and industrial sectors due to my professional work. At the same time, I worked hard on the investigation and research of Chinese bookkeeping, and gained some insights, which changed my concept of Chinese bookkeeping. I believed that Chinese bookkeeping was not without organization, and that the accounting method was not entirely unreasonable. The problem was the inconsistency. Not only was it necessary to maintain it in form, but it also had its value in essence. And given its wide use and long history, I felt that the foundation was very strong and could not be replaced by Western bookkeeping. But at the same time, I also found that it had many shortcomings and needed to be improved. At that time, I planned the accounting organization for various companies based on this view, stipulating the classification of accounts, the organization of accounting books, and accounting rules, etc., so that the handling of accounting affairs had a certain standard. The pure cash accounting method (that is, the running entry is copied and cleaned, and the receipts and payments are not reversed) that has been used in China for a long time was used as before. The use of full writing or numerical characters for the amount was left to the freedom of the bookkeeper. The accounting books were not specially printed in a fixed format in order to facilitate implementation. This was the third stage of my efforts to improve Chinese bookkeeping. The results have been good so far. However, the common regret at that time was that the amount occupied more space, the accounting books were in vertical style, and the multi-column accounting method could not be adopted. The control accounting method, which is most commendable in Western bookkeeping, could not be imitated. Therefore, it was considered that improving Chinese bookkeeping was only suitable for those with fewer receipts and payments, and was not enough to talk about large-scale enterprises. In 1926 and 1927, I gave a speech at the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, and mentioned this as a shortcoming. Today's reformers of Chinese bookkeeping still have this feeling.</p>
<p>In recent years, I have been entrusted to design improved Chinese bookkeeping for the business community more and more, and the results have gradually become apparent. And there has been continuous progress in the understanding of Chinese bookkeeping and the discovery of improvement methods. The most gratifying things are the following three:</p>
<p>(1) The ability of Western bookkeeping methods to adapt the organization of accounting books to the size of the business and the complexity of the accounts is entirely dependent on the use of multi-column accounting methods and the division of accounting books to achieve differentiation and aggregation, and to improve the efficiency of accounting work. Chinese accounting books are written vertically, and the vertical width should not be too long. Although there is no convenience for laying out multiple columns of amounts, the method of dividing accounting books can be used to change the organization of accounting books. For example, cash diaries can be divided into several books, such as cash diaries, bank diaries, incoming bill diaries, outgoing bill diaries, and transfer diaries, based on the purpose of receipts and payments. If the nature of the accounts is the standard, it can be divided into several books, such as purchase payment, sales receipt, various expenses, and cash diaries. In addition, such as goods books, cleaning books, etc., can be divided into several types according to their nature, this is one of them. (2) In Western bookkeeping, there is the so-called voucher bookkeeping method, which uses vouchers instead of accounting books. There is also the so-called control bookkeeping method, which summarizes and records similar items in order to facilitate posting and settlement. Both save a great deal of labor and expense in accounting affairs. Because of handling the accounting affairs of a certain cardboard company and a certain shipping company (both using Western voucher bookkeeping methods), I discovered a simple control bookkeeping method in Chinese bookkeeping, which was implemented in a certain pharmacy and a certain bookstore, and achieved great results, this is the second thing.</p>
<p>(3) The four-column clearing register is an ancient method in our country. If it can be used well, it can be used to compile daily, monthly or annual settlement statements based on various differentiated diaries and cleaning books. It can check whether there are any errors in recording and calculation in each period; and it can show the results and processes of account receipts and payments in each period, and compare them. Compared with the balance trial calculation method of Western bookkeeping, the effect is even greater, this is the third thing. With these three new discoveries, Chinese bookkeeping can also be applied to the accounting of large-scale enterprises, such as a large tobacco company, a large pharmacy, a large bookstore, etc., which are typical examples. Improving Chinese bookkeeping can be said to have a rough outline. Since last year, I have decided to formulate a standard plan to seek universal improvement of Chinese bookkeeping, but I have not been able to do so in a hurry. In May and June this year, I was invited by the Accounting and Political Society to lecture in Nanjing. Most of the listeners were accounting scholars, and some also involved this issue, all of whom were appreciated. But vulgar affairs are bleak, and it has been a long time without success. Since October, I have abandoned all affairs and devoted myself to this. Then I wrote a book called "An Overview of Improving Chinese Bookkeeping," which is divided into six chapters: Introduction, Improvement Outline, Account Classification, Accounting Book Organization, Accounting Book Formats, and Registration Methods, and Accounting Rules, etc., to be published and asked for correction from colleagues. This is the fourth stage of my efforts to improve Chinese bookkeeping.</p>
<p>This improvement plan is considered to be a reasonable bookkeeping method. In China, it can also be used as a standard for bookkeeping methods. Compared with Western double-entry bookkeeping, there is nothing that cannot be connected in principle. As for the accounting books being vertical, the accounting method being separate receipts and payments, the writing being in Chinese, and the paper being domestic products, although it is convenient for promotion, it has never deviated from the principles of double-entry bookkeeping. If I have time in the future, I plan to compile a bookkeeping book with Chinese and Western styles listed side by side, which may also be for the self-promotion of Chinese bookkeeping methods.</p>
<p>All of the above are the author's experiences over the years. In the future, I also plan to give public lectures in various universities, publish special issues in the accounting magazine published by my office, and add special courses to the affiliated training classes to promote the development of the Chinese bookkeeping improvement movement. I hope that accounting experts at home and abroad will come forward to teach me.</p>
<h3 id="e235">The Significance of Improving Chinese Bookkeeping <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— Pan Wen'an</p>
<p>Recently, I saw in the newspaper an advertisement for the issuance of improved Chinese accounting books prepared by my friend Accountant Xu Yushu, and I was deeply gratified that this move would be sufficient to eliminate the bad habits of old-fashioned merchants and complete the work of accounting revolution. Currently, I am honored to have received a copy of "An Overview of Improving Chinese Bookkeeping" by Accountant Xu himself! After reading it, I felt that the key points of its reform were based on double-entry bookkeeping, while emphasizing the preservation of inherent conventions. This is a meticulous plan and a comprehensive design. It also has ingenious ingenuity.</p>
<p>In the past few years, I have followed the gentlemen in the national goods industry to promote the national goods business, supporting and assisting with all my strength. After several changes in winter and summer, I am ashamed that there is little success. Every year-end, I always review my past work, and I deeply feel that the results obtained are not proportional to our efforts. Although this kind of disappointment is said to be an inherent phenomenon in the vortex of the world's economic decline and domestic political instability, the incompatibility of China's economic and management system with the development of the social environment, and the failure of merchants' financial administration to enter the right track are also the main reasons: Please state as left;</p>
<p>(1) The malpractice of management system tending to westernization In recent years, people in the industrial and commercial circles have been aware of the prevalence of industrial rationalization in Europe, America and Japan, and have gradually realized the need to reform the management system. They have gradually imitated Europe and the United States in all facilities, and only followed the foreigners. However, the improvement of the system relies on self-sufficient equipment as an aid. In China, where the level of technology is still immature, all the equipment used under the new system is still far from the realm of self-sufficiency. In the end, the management equipment can only rely on foreign goods. My friend Jin Muyao said in his article "Management System and National Goods Movement"; "Before China opened to the sea, there was no relationship between the supply and demand of goods and the West. The items used by the people were self-produced and self-supplied, and there was no concept of using foreign goods. We only need to look at the equipment in the old-fashioned stores to understand this. The accounting books for receiving and paying from top to bottom, inkstones, pens, abacuses, book clips and other supplies are all local products; but since the reform, these old things have been abandoned with the change of the management system. The most capable expression of this phenomenon is a few brand-new banks. Bank bookkeeping is a new type of bookkeeping. Because it is written horizontally and uses international numbers, it has to use foreign paper, cloth-bound or leather-bound covers, as well as steel pens, pencils, inks and paper that are related to it, all of which must be foreign goods. Even the abacus, a special product of our country, is replaced by calculators from other countries. In this way, the management system is of course fully new, but the abandonment of national goods and the use of foreign goods has increased the import surplus in trade, which is a very serious problem. Even the newer the management system, the more westernized the items used. Therefore, in a certain sense, the abnormal innovation of the management system is a very uneconomical thing. In fact, the parties concerned did not intend to westernize, but felt that under the new management system, everything is more convenient in Western style." (Original text in Shenbao) can be said to be incisive. The way to promote national goods is to expand their sales, but under the current production environment in China, the improvement of the management system is enough to shrink the market for national goods. Such a serious contradiction is what people who are concerned about the national goods business are eager to solve.</p>
<p>(2) Insufficient accounting supervision It has been observed that the failure of factories and commercial firms is mostly due to the laxity of internal management and the malpractices of financial administration. To get to the root of the problem, it is nothing more than the failure of accounting supervision to be thorough. Because the old-fashioned accounting is chaotic in system, vague in items, and has no method of internal control. If precautions are neglected, malpractices will arise spontaneously. Moreover, the significance of accounting settlement is originally to guide the business policy of merchants and to express the financial situation: the organization of old-fashioned accounting books is not enough to talk about accounting principles, then its guidance to merchants' business is like a blind man riding a blind horse, and it is difficult for it not to collapse.</p>
<p>Accountant Xu advocates the improvement of Chinese bookkeeping, which will undoubtedly provide a lot of assistance in the reform of commercial management. The accounting books, pens and inks used are all domestic products, which is even more commendable. Utilizing the advantages of the new style and avoiding the first type of malpractice mentioned above is indeed a move that suits my heart. The recording, posting, settlement and table preparation procedures of the improved Chinese bookkeeping are all in line with the principles of double-entry bookkeeping, and the methods are simple and suitable for use by old-fashioned accounting personnel. In the future, if it is widely promoted, the financial malpractices of national goods manufacturers will be reduced as a result, and the second difficulty that we have been criticizing may also be solved easily. Our future work in promoting national goods may achieve twice the result with half the effort.</p>
<p>The contributions of improved Chinese bookkeeping to commercial management and accounting organization have been mentioned above. In addition to praying for good luck, I also believe that there are two points worth considering, and I would like to discuss them with Accountant Xu:</p>
<h3 id="e236">The Origin and Division of Eastern and Western Bookkeeping Methods <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Yongzuo</p>
<p>Since there are human beings, there are written contracts, the system of recording numbers and the technique of arithmetic began. The preface of Xiahou Yang's Arithmetic Classic says: Arithmetic originated from Fuxi, and the Yellow Emperor set three numbers to ten levels, and Li Shou then wrote nine chapters. Ancient Italian history claims that the Mediterranean basin has a long history of recording numbers and events on metals or ceramics. It can be imagined that the relationship between the early number recording and arithmetic of the East and the West, and the calculation and bookkeeping techniques is close. However, in the beginning, human civilization was immature, and materials were not available; transactions and exchanges were rare; the tools for calculation and recording were also very heavy; therefore, the methods of arithmetic were still simple, and the tools for recording numbers were only for memorization! It is not possible to talk about bookkeeping methods.</p>
<p>As civilization progresses and the receipt and payment of wealth becomes more frequent, national and household economies become increasingly important. The art of calculation must be precise and consistent. The system of number recording must also be neat and easy to calculate. The art of bookkeeping gradually evolves. It can be seen from the emphasis on national accounting systems and arithmetic research in ancient civilizations in the East and the West. Those who have been good at accounting in our country since ancient times must be proficient in arithmetic, and the bookkeeping books left over from ancient Europe are often written by mathematicians. The evolution of bookkeeping methods with arithmetic is the same in the East and the West.</p>
<p>The influence of arithmetic on bookkeeping methods is like an equation. When discussing Eastern bookkeeping methods, the four-column clearing register method in our country is often used as its representative. When discussing Western bookkeeping methods, the double-entry recording method is often used as its representative. They are all regular and precise, and have a balanced calculation method. The four-column method and the double-entry method are both derived from the equation in arithmetic. The equation in the East developed very early. The eighth chapter of the Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art is the equation chapter. This book was published before the Han Dynasty, so it can be imagined that the equation occurred early. Therefore, the four-column method was already popular in the Song Dynasty, no less than a thousand years ago. The equation in the West developed later. In 1494 of the Western calendar, Lucas Paciolo began to establish a special chapter in his book "Summa de Arithmetica, Geometria, Proportioni et Proportionalita" called "Particulalas de Computis et Lcripturis", applying this formula to bookkeeping, and producing the double-entry bookkeeping method, which is only four hundred and some years old. The changes in Eastern bookkeeping methods in modern times are all within the scope of the four-column clearing register method, and the changes in Western bookkeeping methods have not deviated from the rules of the double-entry bookkeeping method. The names of the two are different, but their origins from the equation are not different. It is intended that the method of recording numbers is mainly to facilitate arithmetic. Although there are various methods of arithmetic, the one that is convenient for the statistics and calculation of accounts is the equation. Therefore, no matter Eastern or Western, all the sages of bookkeeping can agree without prior consultation.</p>
<p>The Eastern four-column method divides the four columns for settlement, and the Western double-entry method corresponds to double-entry bookkeeping. Some people think that they are different. In fact, the four columns are old management, new receipt, removal, and actual. New receipt is total receipt, removal is total payment, and actual is closing receipt or closing payment. The actual in this period is the old management in the next period. In terms of Western-style various accounts, the total debit, the total credit, the debit difference or the credit difference; or the cash receipt and payment account, the previous balance, the current receipt, the current payment, and the current balance, what is the difference? The difference is that the old management of various accounts is also independent, so the comparison of the previous and subsequent, and the status of the process are more clear, unlike the Western style, which only establishes four columns in the cash account. This is in terms of the four-column method. Eastern and Western bookkeeping methods originally have common points. The original text of double-entry is Doubl eentry; Doppelbuchuug, meaning double-entry, whenever recording an account, it should be established simultaneously on the debit side and the credit side, in other words, each entry and exit must have two or more entries to make the debit and credit sides stand together. Whenever the account is closed and reported, each item should also be listed separately for debit and credit, so that it can be compared. The double-entry method created by Pacioli and the continental bookkeeping method that still exists today are all like this. However, as the organization of accounting books is gradually differentiated, each accounting book is based on a certain specific item, and only the corresponding item is recorded when recording an account. Therefore, in terms of each differentiated accounting book, the record is like a single entry. It is necessary to collect all accounting books for a summary observation to clearly show its double entry. The more differentiated the organization of accounting books, the more simple the records of each accounting book. The so-called double-entry or debit-credit comparison is almost only for the debit-credit comparison table. The method of double-entry has changed greatly. There are many examples in the current British and American double-entry bookkeeping methods. If these bookkeeping methods are all double-entry, then Eastern bookkeeping methods also have the same example. The various diaries are based on a certain special item, and the receipts and payments of the corresponding items are recorded. When the accounts of the cleaning book are entered into the balance sheet and the income statement, the receipts and payments are listed up and down for mutual comparison, and can be balanced and settled. This is the same as the spirit of Western double-entry. This is in terms of the double-entry method. Eastern and Western bookkeeping methods also have common phenomena.</p>
<p>The origin and laws of Eastern and Western bookkeeping methods have the common features mentioned above. However, those who are engaged in bookkeeping cannot fail to understand each other. What is the reason? In addition to the difference in text, there is also a major division. The recording of accounts in Eastern bookkeeping methods is divided into receipts and payments. The reason why receipts and payments are divided depends on whether the account is a receipt or payment for money. The recording of accounts in Western bookkeeping methods first distinguishes between debit and credit. The reason why debit and credit are distinguished depends on whether the other party of the account is a debtor or creditor for the operator. The former is subjective in dividing receipts and payments, and the latter is objective in distinguishing between debit and credit. Therefore, the receipts and payments in Eastern bookkeeping are the income or payment of money itself. For example, the income deposit is recorded in the income item; the debit and credit in Western bookkeeping are the debtor or creditor of the item itself. For example, the income deposit should be recorded on the credit side. In arithmetic, the arrangement of positive and negative numbers is exactly the opposite, the method of arithmetic is the same, and the balance of the equation obtained is also the same, but the starting point of number recording is different. The way to express the increase or decrease of property is also different. This is indeed a major division of Eastern and Western bookkeeping methods. Some people call Eastern bookkeeping method the receipt and payment bookkeeping method, and Western bookkeeping method the debit and credit bookkeeping method, precisely for this reason.</p>
<p>Although the nature of the Eastern receipt and payment bookkeeping method and the Western debit and credit bookkeeping method is different, they are consistent with the right track of number recording and arithmetic. Users have their own long history, so there is no need to force Liu Yi, and it is not appropriate to force uniformity. Therefore, those who study bookkeeping methods should first understand its origin, distinguish its divisions, and guide it in accordance with the situation. Since the end of the 19th century, Western bookkeeping methods have been introduced into the East. Those who are curious and show off do not know that the debit and credit bookkeeping method and the receipt and payment bookkeeping method come from the equation in arithmetic. The former's novelty is precious, and the latter's oldness is to be discarded. They often promote the former and suppress the latter, which is very confusing. Today's improved Chinese bookkeeping does not abandon the receipt and payment bookkeeping method because it is old-fashioned. They are diligently organizing and improving it with a scientific spirit. Those who understand the origin of number recording and arithmetic, and can distinguish the divisions of Eastern and Western cultures, should have the same feeling.</p>
<h3 id="e237">The Advantages of Improving Chinese Bookkeeping <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Boyuan</p>
<p>All commercial receipts and payments, whether ancient or modern, Chinese or foreign, have book records to observe the increase or decrease of wealth and the profit or loss of business; although the types of businesses are different and the complexity of business is different, the accounting principles applied in bookkeeping are the same. The Chinese bookkeeping, which has been used in our country for generations, is often criticized by the world for its lack of organization and system. Today's scholars of accounting all despise Chinese bookkeeping, thinking that it is not worthy of learning, and all regard Western bookkeeping as the standard. However, the commercial practices of our country have been applied to each other for thousands of years, and they have not changed for a long time. To this day, except for a few new enterprises, the large and small businesses across the country still use them as before, so there must be something indelible in them. Bookkeeping is a practical and economical science. If it is practical and has economic effect, its effectiveness will be obvious. Although Western bookkeeping is more methodical and standard than Chinese bookkeeping, its theory is profound and its method is complicated. It is not easy to engage in it without considerable training. The cultivation of talents is costly, and paper and stationery are all foreign goods, which is costly and costly. On the contrary, the shortcomings of the Western style are the strengths of the Chinese style. If we can improve the shortcomings of the Chinese style, wouldn't it be more beautiful than the Western style? In short, there is no distinction between Chinese and foreign goods, and the system does not discuss the East and the West. Choosing the good and following it is the best. Mr. Xu Yongzuo is a pioneer in the accounting profession, proficient in his studies, and able to not agree with the public opinion, take the improvement of Chinese bookkeeping as his responsibility, and vigorously promote it, which is very insightful. The book "An Overview of Improving Chinese Bookkeeping" is easy to understand, the theory is thorough, and the equipment is comprehensive. The proposed samples of Chinese bookkeeping forms are clearly annotated, practical, and well-organized. They have the advantages of the Western style and the convenience of the Chinese style. As the author said, it is to seek universal progress for the Chinese accounting community, and I dare to believe that it is to seek universal benefits for the Chinese business community. The effect of this is great and beneficial, and it is also a great event in the academic world.</p>
<p>(1) The "Overview of Improving Chinese Bookkeeping" discusses the advantages and disadvantages of Chinese bookkeeping and the new procedures for registering accounts, setting the clauses for counterfeiting, listing the account forms, checking and issuing the gates, which are detailed and clear. Even those who have no knowledge of bookkeeping can manage it easily by following the rules and regulations. However, it may not be enough to talk about self-generation of changes and adapting to local conditions. Because each clause listed in the overview seems to be just a procedure on the surface, but behind it contains accounting theory. The advocates have a plan in mind, and they can change at any time and be successful in everything. However, the learners stick to the set pattern and do not know why, so we dare not believe that they can use it freely.</p>
<p>(2) Old-fashioned merchants inherit the traditional thinking and are immersed in the philosophy of "everyone sweeps the snow in front of their own door." It is really like asking the tiger for its skin to ask them to recognize the advantages and necessity of improving Chinese bookkeeping! In this merchant society that lacks automatic spirit, only the trade associations can persuade the counterparts to adopt it together from the standpoint of improving the management system and promoting business development; the government agencies can inform the merchants (at least those who are organized as companies) to strive for reform from the standpoint of promoting public integrity and protecting the interests of creditors.</p>
<p>The above two points are only for reference based on my personal feelings. I sincerely hope for it, so I can't help but think too much. 22, 12, 21, at the Four-Bank Savings Association</p>
<h3 id="e238">After Reading "An Introduction to Improved Chinese Bookkeeping" <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Peikun</p>
<p>In the past decade or so, those in our country engaged in cashiering and accounting have largely been committed to adopting new-style bookkeeping. Government organizations, as well as companies and public groups in major cities, have gradually implemented and standardized their forms, books, and records. Indeed, the so-called scientification and rationalization of modern business operations have become almost universally adopted. Accounting manages the pivot of capital utilization, and bookkeeping is the factual record of account receipts and expenditures. Due to the limitations of the format, it has become a specialized discipline. It is true that our country cannot adhere rigidly to old methods and remain unchanged. The horizontal writing from left to right and the reliance on foreign goods for pens, ink, paper, and stationery are details that should not be overly scrutinized. However, I now have some doubts. What are these doubts? It is that the implementation of new-style bookkeeping may not be entirely suitable for China's national conditions. The purpose of learning is application, and modern scientists emphasize both theory and practice. In the past, I, being unworthy, held a position at the National Shanghai College of Commerce, and I always strived to cultivate practical talents. Therefore, whenever compiling curricula and selecting teaching materials, I repeatedly considered this objective. Bookkeeping and accounting are considered practical sciences. Practical sciences are diverse, but the key is to make promotion universal and their effect obvious as the sole principle. The accounting method of new-style bookkeeping must first involve debit and credit entries. Although settlement and reconciliation are based on academic principles, they can achieve the same result through different routes. However, the procedures are cumbersome, recording takes time, the underlying principles are difficult to understand, and it is easy to cause confusion. This is completely different from the old Chinese methods and is not easily understood by every household. Conversely, teachers and students studying bookkeeping today all say that banking bookkeeping is not difficult. They do not know that the old Chinese accounting method divides into four columns, with cash receipts and payments as the standard. The current banking accounting system's adoption of cash entry method does, in fact, subtly align with this, hence the saying that it is not difficult. Mr. Xu extracts the essence of the old method, eliminates the blockages of the new system, reconciling academic principles and returning to practicality, calling it "Improved Chinese Bookkeeping," which allows people to know at a glance that it is Chinese bookkeeping, pioneering the independence of our country's science. Its merit is immense. Moreover, its organization is clear, the procedures are concise, and its promotion is convenient. Scholars of the new learning, proficient in foreign sciences, obtain their secrets, but the lesser ones merely imitate the superficial aspects and despise everything Chinese, thinking it is all unworthy. This is the most extreme example of forgetting one's ancestors despite inheriting their legacy. What should Mr. Xu do? What should we do?</p>
<h3 id="e239">On Reading "An Introduction to Improved Chinese Bookkeeping" <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Huan Cheng</p>
<p>I learned "Gu Bi" (old style bookkeeping) in my youth and am an amateur in accounting. My family had a shop, and I suffered from the lack of clarity and inconvenience of reviewing old-style bookkeeping records. I often changed it according to my own ideas, just to make it easier to review, without knowing the so-called academic principles. In the late Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty, Teacher Tang Zhexian entrusted me with the responsibility of accounting for the Zhejiang Railway Company. At that time, the debate between new and old bookkeeping methods was quite intense. After more than half a year, it was impossible to complete the final accounts and report, which worried Teacher Zhe. The so-called new bookkeeping at that time was not double-entry accounting but only slightly modified the form, while those who advocated the old bookkeeping adamantly said it was not possible. In fact, neither side had any real understanding. After taking office, I groped my way forward, first defining the account subjects, then determining the types and organization of bookkeeping, and finally using the old method for the form, also referring to the Japanese railway bookkeeping format according to my own ideas. Fortunately, the final accounts were completed on time, and the report was correct. However, after working for half a year, I started before dawn and did not rest until midnight, working so hard that I almost became ill, and I asked for sick leave and left. What I was not satisfied with at that time was that I focused on the cost of road construction, so I strongly advocated that the purchase and receipt of materials must be entered into the accounting records through accounting, while the engineers and material supervisors believed that accounting was only in charge of cash and suspected that the consultant materials were exceeding their authority, arguing for several months without a solution. It was Zhu Jun Shoumen, the successor, who insisted on material price transfer, and the Ministry of Communications even awarded the Zhejiang Railway accounting as the best among the railways. At that time, the atmosphere was just opening up, and there were very few scholars who were familiar with bookkeeping, only engaging in large-scale projects for foreign merchants and borrowing money to build roads, learning the form but not knowing the principle, and unable to do anything when moved to another place, unable to implement double-entry bookkeeping. However, I firmly believe that the Chinese bookkeeping method can be used, but it depends on whether the general accountants will simplify it and do not know how to record and manage accounts, and also rely solely on books to enlighten them, resulting in fragmented and incomplete records, unable to fully perform the duties of verification and summary. This is my experience from twenty-eight years ago, which I often keep in mind. In recent years, I have helped a friend to reform the accounting of the China Merchants Group, and experts were hired to adopt double-entry bookkeeping, making the work easier (see the Accounting Regulations of the China Merchants Group, Mr. Xu Yushu, who is one of those in charge). Compared with the hard work and hardship of the Zhejiang Railway, the difference in work intensity is due to the times. Shanghai has been open to foreign trade for nearly a hundred years, but in terms of bookkeeping, even in large shops in commercial ports and among overseas Chinese merchants, the old style still accounts for nine out of ten, and the double-entry style accounts for less than one out of ten, not to mention the limitations of funding, talent, and customs in the interior. It is difficult to force it. Accountant Xu Yushu recently created "Improved Chinese Bookkeeping." I have been concerned with this issue for more than twenty years. Now someone has risen to answer it, and I cannot help but feel happy and amazed. I respectfully recount my memories and experiences to corroborate it. I dare to assert that the effectiveness of improved Chinese bookkeeping will far exceed the promotion of Western-style bookkeeping. As the Grand Historian Sima Qian said, "The best way is to follow the existing, the next best is to guide it." With the vast majority using old bookkeeping, and the improvements being thorough and easy to implement, its contribution to society, economy, law, and other aspects will be a great undertaking. Is Mr. Yushu practicing the way of "following the existing"? It is lofty and admirable. December 19, 1933.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the foreign call loan market was quiet due to a lack of trading, so the price remained unchanged at 7 percent. "Hua Tou" (commission) was not traded. This is because banks are closed, and this type of transaction is not usually done. In the call loan market, the early session had over 4.9 million in fund transfers, over 500,000 in new transactions, and over 200,000 in the afternoon session. The small general association had over 400,000 in transactions. Money shops had over 3.9 million in foreign public bond settlements. There were over 300,000 in remittances from various routes, over 400,000 in foreign collateral loans, 30,000 from various sources, and 150,000 in repayments. In the Shanghai small silver market, the morning price was 841 yuan, and the afternoon price was 842 yuan. The morning session saw 7,000 "jiao" (ten-cent coins) traded, and the afternoon session saw 9,500 "jiao" traded.

<h3 id="e241">Securities: Last Week's Bond Market Was Relatively Quiet <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>Most bonds fell by over one yuan over the week.</p>
<p>December futures have only two days left.</p>
<p>Last week, from December 18th to 23rd, the market activity at the Chinese Securities Exchange experienced fluctuations in the first half of the week and settled down in the second half. Although the December futures were very close to settlement, there was no major squeeze. Regarding the current situation, political maneuvering has given way to military means. Zhang Ji and his party will return to Beijing soon. The results of this trip are still unknown. Observing the central government's proactive approach to Fujian, on one hand, there is a general military mobilization, and on the other hand, an order to suppress is about to be issued, which may have obtained considerable understanding from the Southwest. The prospect of the war is unpredictable. Most market participants are taking a long position based on the assumption that the central government's military strength against one province should not be difficult. Others believe that the war will expand, and any setback will lead to a significant drop. Opinions are divided, and each has their own hopes. As a result, market prices have gradually become quieter. On Monday, due to the contact between Fujian and Zhejiang and the Japanese attempt to survey, major players sold off, causing prices to fall by a few "jiao" to over one yuan. On Tuesday, there were many rumors, including the reorganization of domestic and foreign debts, the re-emergence of the Third Government, and other unfounded rumors. Although it was known that they were inaccurate, many long positions were frightened out, causing market prices to plummet by one to two yuan. On Wednesday, the rumors subsided, and short positions made some adjustments, recovering about half a yuan in the morning. There was no market in the afternoon due to unforeseen circumstances. On Thursday, full-day trading of four sessions resumed, and the market became quieter. Although there was a large sale of the 75th issue, the market price fluctuated, indicating a balance. On Friday, short positions rolled over, and the 75th issue continued to be sold off, while the 16th and 21st issues saw considerable buying, causing the market price to rise by about one yuan. On Saturday, long and short positions rolled over, and the market price fluctuated, resulting in a slight gain of half a yuan. Over the week, most bonds fell by over one yuan. The total trading volume was 99,713,000 yuan. The December futures trading has only two days left. The results of the highs, lows, rises, and falls are listed below (unit: yuan, trading unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the supply from various sources was slightly scarce, with over 30 vessels of "Hou Geng" (late japonica rice) and various colors (over 5,000 "shi" (bushels)) and 16 or 17 vessels of late rice (over 2,000 "shi"). However, market conditions remained weak. The late rice was not active due to "Bao Wei" (wholesale merchants) and guest merchants closing shop for the Western calendar's winter solstice customs closure. Those stocking up also stopped, so only other merchants were active. Only one load of "Xi Lian" (West Lian) rice was sold in bulk, so prices continued to fall by about one "jiao." The prices of "Hou Geng" and "Du Yang Jian" (Du Yang pointed rice) were also lower by several "fen" (cents) to about one "jiao" due to slightly weaker demand from shop merchants. The "Yin Yuan" (Silver Yuan) rice was sluggish, continuing to decline by about one "jiao." "Bian Yuan" (Changed Yuan) rice saw no change.</p>

<h3 id="e244">Empty Talk <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Yan</p>
<p>In this age, speaking is indeed not easy. However, Heaven has endowed humans with the ability to speak, with good intentions, to give people another means of earning a living, in addition to fighting, running, jumping, and thinking. Looking at various countries in the East and West, whether in politics, business, or academia, those who occupy higher positions all have extraordinary eloquence. In other words, speaking is an innate ability given to humans, but there are great differences in skill, just like magic tricks. Those who can master these tricks will naturally have no problem making a living, and even getting promoted and becoming rich will not be difficult!</p>
<p>So, how should one begin to study the art of speaking? This is difficult! Because speaking is divided into dozens of categories, such as telling cold jokes, telling jokes, speaking dead words, boasting, speaking sarcastic remarks, complaining, lying, talking nonsense, and speaking lively words, each with its own unique skills, and it is impossible to learn them all at once! And among them, there is one most skillful and currently the most fashionable type of speaking: "empty talk," which is even more extraordinary!</p>
<p>However, phrases like "The weather is really nice today," "I think so too," "Whatever you think is fine," "I'll treat you to dinner in a few days," although they can be considered part of empty talk, are not subtle and straightforward, so people know you are just being perfunctory, which is not skillful at all. Truly clever people would never speak like this. Their empty talk is often the following two sentences.</p>
<p>The first sentence is "My power is insufficient." This sentence seems to be a firm refusal and not a perfunctory remark. They often express deep regret that they do not have the power to accept your request, appearing very sincere. However, how do you measure whether their power is truly "insufficient"? Even more admirable is that this sentence is soft on the surface but hard in reality. Even if you want to say a few more words, you can't, because they have already declared their inability to act. How can you force them?</p>
<p>The second sentence is "Nothing is impossible under heaven." This is such a philosophical statement! Although this sentence, if not spoken to someone who is asking you for something, can be categorized as "speaking dead words," it is actually the smartest and most skillful empty talk when someone is asking you for something. When people come to ask you for something, they often have a very serious expression on their face. After you say this, it's like pouring boiling water on clouds, and the situation will surely ease up. Even if you completely reject their request, they will not hate you. On the contrary, they will be very happy, thinking that you have given them the ultimate comfort in their hearts!</p>
<h3 id="e245">Leisure <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Limin</p>
<p>The two characters "leisure," in more common terms, means "free time."</p>
<p>We, the Chinese people, are all princes and grandsons after all, putting the serious national crisis, natural disasters, and man-made calamities behind us, indulging in pleasure, intoxicated in a world of gold and paper. Not to mention other things, just in social gatherings, when friends meet, they always ask, "What kind of entertainment have you been engaged in lately?" The other party will definitely answer, "Very leisurely, just doing some boring pastimes!" It can be seen that the leisure of your country's people truly lives up to the descendants of the Yellow Emperor!</p>
<p>Opium, cigarettes, Pai Gow, poker, yellow wine, brandy... these are our people's completely authentic leisure products; cafes, dance halls, movie theaters, massage parlors, teahouses, and taverns... those are our people's leisure places based on reason; the incapable A Dou who has nothing to do enjoys all the blessings in the world.</p>
<p>However, there are generally fools who are so bored with leisure that they worry about not being hungry after eating, causing trouble in the east and disaster in the west, making the world upside down and the people unable to live. What is the point?</p>
<p>In fact, there is no need to curse "leisure," and even less to eliminate "leisure." One should use many short leisure periods, leisure periods wasted by people, to pursue knowledge; such as the famous British statesman Gladstone, who always carried a small book with him, reading whenever he had free time. Therefore, over time, he accumulated vast knowledge. Another example is Faraday, the famous inventor in the field of electricity, who, while binding books for people, also conducted scientific experiments, writing to a friend, "What I need is time. I wish I could buy many empty hours or even empty days from 'leisurely people.'"</p>
<p>Find a way to eliminate leisure. Incapable A Dou who are idle, wake up!</p>
<h3 id="e246">The Apartment in the Old Capital <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— Ping Fan</p>
<p>Leaving my beautiful hometown, Suzhou, I wandered to a corner of the north. With such shallow experience, I felt cold at heart when I arrived in an unfamiliar place. It wasn't an unhelpful act to have found a fellow villager who introduced me to a very quiet apartment!</p>
<p>Apartments are a unique type of lodging in the North. That apartment was in a remote area, making it the quietest of quiet places. There was a spacious field in front of the entrance, and the night view was even quieter. I love peace and quiet, so I felt very comfortable in my heart and wanted to write more.</p>
<p>"One, two, three...four." As soon as I started writing, a very disciplined sound came from outside. Children playing around wouldn't be so loud, but it didn't stop. All my thoughts of writing were driven away, and I couldn't put my pen down. I went outside to take a look. Four people in a row were wearing military uniforms. They were our revolutionary soldiers. Living in an apartment meant there would be military education and training. This was an unexpected harvest.</p>
<p>According to them, most of the residents of the apartment are students, and university students at that, so the calm sunlight passed over the window screens during the day. In the evening, pure plainsong, harmonicas, and foreign tunes that I couldn't name would begin to play. Although even in the middle of the night, there were still remnants of the melodies flowing.</p>
<p>I didn't find this kind of life annoying, because it was my first time testing it out.</p>
<p>These past few days have intensified. Not only is there military drill in the afternoon, but there's also a hasty bugle call before daybreak. The family next door played a talking machine all night long. I heard they invited friends over to play.</p>
<p>The North is not like Jiangnan. It just entered late autumn, and it started to snow. The ground was covered in white. The north wind howled. Each room had a coal stove installed. Rich people didn't care and used good coal chunks. Like several other people who didn't use coal chunks, I used coal briquettes. Burning coal briquettes can produce carbon monoxide poisoning. Someone was poisoned by the coal that day and drank a lot of sour cabbage soup. The next day, I also threw my coal stove in the corner of the yard.</p>
<p>The weather was very cold. I couldn't bear it without a stove, but I was afraid of being poisoned if I used one. I should go to bed earlier at night. The Huqin (Chinese violin) was playing "Si Lang Visits His Mother"... From "One, two, three... four" to "Charge! Kill!" I could only lie on the kang (heated brick bed) with my eyes open. Fine! I couldn't take it anymore. I said to the manager, "I might want to go to the south tomorrow. Or maybe move out!" I didn't actually mean it. But that evening, two people came to see the room. Business was really good! I don't know how there were so many customers.</p>
<p>The shop assistant said that a gentleman had been missing for a few days. Later, it was discovered that he had been taken away by the ×× team and locked up in the ×× Bureau, but no one knew what was going on.</p>
<h3 id="e247">"Poet's Lane" <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— Chun Liu</p>
<p>Within the city limits of Nanjing, there are two lanes where the poetic atmosphere is richest: one is Longpan Lane in the west of the city, and the other is Cotton Shoe Camp in the east of the city.</p>
<p>Longpan Lane is a desolate lane sandwiched between Qingliang Mountain and Wulongtan, with one end closely connected to the mountains and fields. It is naturally rich in poetic flavor. Cotton Shoe Camp, however, is completely different from it.</p>
<p>This Cotton Shoe Camp, known as "Poet's Lane," is located in the middle of the bustling city. The north and south of it, such as Zhongzheng Street in the south and Changfu Street in the north, are both large roads in Nanjing. However, the street itself has a kind of quiet and solemn meaning, fully resembling a beautiful Song poem. The streets are neat, and the residents on both sides have water-milled brick walls. Almost every house has many ancient trees extending from within the walls. These trees are either elm trees, paulownia trees, or桫 trees. When deep autumn arrives, the streets are full of late yellow fallen leaves. In particular, the row of houses on the east side of the street, because behind them is one of the most beautiful curves of the "Nine Curves of Qingxi," each house has a water pavilion built. When we sail on the Qinhuai River, we can identify that is the Lan Garden, that is the Jian Garden, and the Spring Garden.</p>
<p>The owners of these houses are almost all "poets." For example, Jian Garden belongs to Wu Jianquan, and Spring Garden was originally named Hao Hall and belongs to Zheng Xiaoxu (of course, there is no need to talk about him now). Mr. Chen Sanli's former Sanli Villa is not far from here.</p>
<p>The last time I walked through this "Poet's Lane," I accidentally broke into a few gardens to take a look, and they all revealed a sense of decline. I heard that the owner of a certain house is in the most dire straits, owing more than a dozen months of housing donations to the Municipal Bureau. I couldn't help but think of a poem by a Song Dynasty poet: "The thatched eaves have a tax for the moon, and there is no rent for a single grain of rice. Life is bleak, and people ask me about the water banana and the calamus."</p>

<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 20: Divination Promises Good Fortune, the Old Man Laughs Away His Worries Day After Day; Old Friends Reside Across the Street</p>
<p>He thought about the two things together, and inevitably thought of them as one thing. So, a flush rose on his face, and even the roots of his ears began to feel hot. Because his face was also hot, he didn't dare to look at his mother, turned over to the inside, and half-closed his eyes to sleep. He heard Jiang Shi say, "What time is it? Still sleeping? Get up." Guizhi didn't say anything and continued to sleep on her side. Jiang Shi said, "Is your body not well again? Get up and sit for a while, don't really sleep yourself sick." Guizhi was about to speak, but her mother's hand had already touched her forehead. She said, "Oh! Your forehead isn't very hot. Why is your face a little flushed?" At this time, it was impossible for Guizhi not to pretend to be sick, so she dragged out a soft voice and said, "Maybe I caught a gust of wind when I went out yesterday, and the illness flared up again. "That's nothing to worry about. I'll sleep until ten o'clock, restore my energy, and the illness will be fine." Jiang Shi laughed and said, "Where is there still ten o'clock? Wait until tonight. It's almost time for lunch." Guizhi stretched out her hands from the cotton quilt, stretched lazily, and smiled, "I really didn't expect that I would sleep until this time in a daze. This is terrible." As she spoke, she grabbed her clothes from the edge of the kang, draped them over herself, and walked down from the kang. She walked to the window, stretched her head out to look outside, to see what time it was. The sky was not clearly visible, but a mirror leaning against the table reflected her face, which was yellowish, and her eye sockets seemed to have sunken quite a bit. After seeing this, she couldn't help but be startled in her heart. How could a day of illness make her so sick? No wonder people say that lovesickness can kill people. Only I know about this kind of thing. If my mother knew, she would say that I, this girl, am not behaving properly. Besides, Zhao Ziqiang is very loyal to me. If I don't marry him, I won't marry him. He can't blame me. Now that I am marrying him, why am I being fickle? That's it! From now on, I will definitely not care about any Second Master Gan or Third Master Gan. When she thought of definitely not caring, she made up her mind one hundred and twenty percent. At that moment, she stomped her foot on the ground. Jiang Shi, seeing her from behind, said in unison, "What's wrong? You're getting anxious again. What is it?" (276)</p>

<p>A man in Chicago named York Robin, recently had an outlandish idea, he prepared two months of dry food and water, climbed into a coffin buried underground and hid. Before carrying it out, he earnestly told people, but refused to reveal the location, fearing that his family would come looking. Later, he did indeed safely spend two months living in the coffin. One day, a car stopped by the tomb, and he emerged from the coffin, got into the car, and returned home, while guiding relatives and friends to inspect the underground coffin. This story has now spread throughout the city of Chicago.</p>

<p>The American Minister of Agriculture, organized an all-England hen egg-laying championship. A few days ago, he announced the hen that laid the most eggs, a large Irish hen from Lancashire. This hen continued to lay eggs for forty-eight weeks, that is, within three hundred and thirty-six days, it laid two hundred and ninety-nine eggs, winning the first prize. There were two others that could lay two hundred and fifty eggs per year, and countless that laid less than two hundred eggs.</p>

<p>Generally, no matter who it is, except in special circumstances, everyone hopes for a long life. There is no one who does not want to live longer. In the United States, in Kings County, there is an old man named Samuel Clay, who is now a hundred years old. Every day, before going to bed at five o'clock in the afternoon, he holds the statue in his chest and prays, saying, "For people in the world, living to eighty years old is most appropriate. I am already a hundred years old this year, and I think I am extremely unwilling. Please God help me to die early." He believes that living twenty years longer means consuming twenty years more of living resources, and he often remembers the ancient saying that to be old and not die is to be a thief.</p>

When the family heard the gunshot, they immediately ran in to rescue him, all thinking that he could not be saved. Later, he was sent to the hospital, and after an X-ray, his heart was on the right side and was not fatally injured. After the operation, he fully recovered.</p>

<p>This summer, the heat in Hungary is unprecedented in centuries. Therefore, not only in resorts do people wear bathrobes, but throughout the country, regardless of men, women, old, or young, people only wear extremely thin bathrobes when going out. However, the government believes that wearing only bathrobes hinders customs, so women on the streets are interfered with by the police every day and subjected to violation of police laws, resulting in an overwhelming situation that cannot be dealt with.</p>

<h3 id="e255">Our Encounters <a href="#e255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Hengzhe returned from a trip to the United States and gave a lecture at Yenching University on some of his impressions of revisiting North America. Among them, he spoke of the gloomy fog of unemployment panic that the American intellectual class was suffering from. He encountered six classmates in the United States, all of whom were university graduates with knowledge and talent above the average, and some even had unique skills. "But none of them did not feel the panic of unemployment. Those with positions felt the instability of their positions, and those without positions felt the difficulty of finding jobs." One of them even said to Mr. Chen: "If you don't help me go to China, I'll just have to jump into the Hudson River!" "Everywhere is desolate, and the world is in darkness." The plight of American intellectuals is so pitiful; compared to our Chinese intellectuals, it's "a close call"! American university graduates have to jump into the Hudson River, and our poet did indeed jump into the Yangtze River.</p>
<p>Some people say that jumping into the river to commit suicide is "weak-willed"; weakness of will may be a factor; but what if the will is strong? Ferri (an Italian criminologist) said: "There is nothing more harmful to the human mind and body than hunger. Hunger is the root of all inhuman and antisocial emotions; on the hunger line, there is no love, no human affection possible." On the hunger line, a strong will manifests as breaking the law and violating prohibitions. The so-called intellectuals do not have the courage to break the law and violate prohibitions; they are wearing long gowns and are embarrassed to step out of the circle of propriety; therefore, there are only two paths to take: one is to sell oneself, and the other is to commit suicide. Those who are unwilling to sully their personality have no choice but to "commit suicide." Qu Yuan wandered along the riverbank, haggard and emaciated; the fisherman told him: "The sage does not cling to things, but is able to move with the world. The world is all muddy, why not stir up its waves? Everyone is drunk, why not feed on its dregs and sip its lees?" Qu Yuan said: "I have heard that those who have just washed their hair will surely flick their hats, and those who have just taken a bath will surely shake their clothes. How can I use my clean body to accept the dirt of things? I would rather go to the Xiang River and be buried in the belly of the river fish, than to cover my bright whiteness with the dust of the world." In the moment of great liberation, Mr. Zhu Xiang must have felt proud enough to say, "Return my clean body!"</p>
<p>When Wang Yangming buried his belongings in Longchang, he tearfully told his servant, "You and I are like them!" Mr. Zhu Xiang's encounter is our encounter. During this year, one of my friends sacrificed himself for others because of hunger, leaving behind an old mother and an orphaned daughter. Another friend had a severe attack of appendicitis and, at the time of his death, was still calculating where he could pre-draw his monthly salary and when the employment contract would be sent, but in the end, there was not enough for a coffin. Are these tragic endings not as heartbreaking as Mr. Zhu Xiang's suicide by jumping into the river? Is it only the vast waves that are our final resting place?</p>
<h3 id="e256">I Also Talk About Nalan Chengde <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Zizhan</p>
<p>Thank you, Mr. Chen Liang, for introducing Nalan Chengde's poetry theory, because the Lushuiting Miscellany is not easy to find. In this poetry theory, it is precisely proved that Nalan Chengde's ci poetry is nothing special, and his slap just hit his own face.</p>
<p>When classical poetry declined, ci poetry arose; when ci poetry declined, the opera lyrics arose; when the opera lyrics declined, Nalan Chengde knew this. At that time, Kunqu Opera still had some remaining strength. Why didn't he write opera lyrics but wrote ci poetry? He said, "Writing poetry is to express feelings. According to the current world, modern-style poetry is enough to express feelings." I also think this is very true. Why doesn't he write modern-style poetry when he picks up his pen to express feelings, but writes ci poetry, which has been abandoned for a long time? He said, "Those who love the past have no real feelings and forcibly imitate their forms to write ancient yuefu, which is particularly meaningless." Is it that those who love the past have no real feelings and forcibly imitate their forms to write ci poetry, which is considered to be particularly meaningful? He said, "In the Song Dynasty, songs and lyrics, and the methods of Tang Dynasty singing poetry were abandoned; when Yuan Dynasty opera lyrics arose, ci poetry was abandoned; when Southern opera lyrics arose, Northern opera lyrics were abandoned. In today's world, singing 'Deer Cry' is like serving dusty rice and smearing mud." In those days, singing the elegant music "Deer Cry" was indeed like serving dusty rice and smearing mud. Ci poetry is no longer singable, and no one sings it. It is not even as good as dusty rice and smeared mud. Why does he insist on eating ci poetry as food? His poetry theory is "anti-imitationism," which I also admit, but he himself is a complete imitationist poet. Although, he also has so-called self-composed tunes, but they are probably not singable, so they cannot be considered creations.</p>
<p>In the history of ci poetry, the first idol was Li Houzhu, and the last idol was Nalan Chengde. Some people even say that Nalan Chengde is the incarnation of Li Houzhu. This is truly nonsense. Wang Guowei proclaimed himself the number one person after Nalan Chengde, so he most complimented Li Houzhu and also greatly complimented Nalan Chengde. Among the ci poets of the Qing Dynasty, Wang Guowei only saw Nalan Chengde, and all the other families were not in his eyes. What is so special about Nalan Chengde?</p>
<p>He was the son of Grand Scholar Mingzhu, a bodyguard of Emperor Kangxi, with a comfortable life, superior education, and a beautiful environment. If he was not born an idiot and was willing to use his considerable talent in filling in ci poetry, getting considerable achievements would not be considered anything. Moreover, the main characters depicted in ci poetry during its heyday were no more than the sons and beautiful women who were the embodiment of the special class, and the actual life depicted was nothing more than the special class enjoying fine wine, women, and singing. For a rich and romantic playboy like Nalan Chengde to imitate such ci poetry, it was naturally possible to succeed. Coincidentally, his beloved wife died, and his mourning for the dead and sighing for the past unconsciously flowed between the lines, covering it with a very strong sentimental atmosphere. Coincidentally, he served as a bodyguard and often accompanied the emperor on tours, horseback riding, shooting, and suburban hunting, which aroused his feelings of frontier melancholy. At the same time, he was a successful candidate in the imperial examination and proclaimed himself elegant, and was able to associate with great celebrities such as Yan Shengsun, Gu Zhenguan, Jiang Chengying, and Chen Weisong. Therefore, he rescued Wu Zhaoqian, a friend exiled to Ningguta, for Gu Zhenguan. This kind of passion and chivalry also became part of his ci poetry, and it was the part most praised by literati. The biographies in the History of the Qing Dynasty said that his ci poetry was widely copied and spread throughout villages, schools, and post walls, which may not be entirely exaggerated. If we want to say what is so special about Nalan Chengde's ci poetry, I think it is here.</p>
<p>"Opening one's mouth to write, even four horses cannot catch up, is not an easy task." That rich and romantic playboy who proclaimed himself talented, if the Lushuiting Miscellany had not discussed poetry and ci poetry and "rashly cursed," he would have given people less material to scold.</p>
<h3 id="e257">Rice Harvesters <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>— Sheng Huanming</p>
<p>When the rice ears are heavy enough to droop, one can see "rice harvesters" continuously on the official road, almost at any time. They carry a straw mat package and some scattered items and a few changes of clothes on the other end of the bamboo pole. Panting, they walk past with an accent from a place one or two hundred miles away.</p>
<p>At this time, families with more fields have to plan how many rice harvesters to hire this year. Rice harvesters are mostly hardworking and rarely unreliable. They are mostly people from the eastern part of the country, because the harvest season there is later than ours, so they take this opportunity to leave home and travel to other places to earn some money, or bring something back.</p>
<p>The harvest season in my hometown is indeed particularly early. The weather is still so hot and sultry, but the rice can be harvested. Precisely because of this, the rice harvesters can rest on the thirteen-hole large stone bridge that connects the countryside and the town before being hired. Their temporary home is this open-air bridge, and life is certainly difficult. When children see rice harvesters passing by, they will hum a song mocking them: It is said that rice harvesters have to pick up watermelon rinds on the bridge to chew to quench their thirst. This situation may be true, because quite a few people are penniless before being hired.</p>
<p>After the harvest season is determined, families needing short-term help go to the area around the large stone bridge to find rice harvesters. Because there are many rice harvesters, the selection is particularly harsh. If they are hired particularly early, then those penniless rice harvesters who are eager to be hired must also have their wages discounted using the principle of "supply and demand." Or, if they are hired particularly late, the rice harvesters will inevitably be devalued even more.</p>
<p>As for my family's rice harvesters, there is a fixed rule: when the time is almost right, the four old rice harvesters always come themselves. They are a family, and they also bring some local specialties when they come. They are like distant relatives to each other. Grandfather waves a wheat stalk fan and talks to them intimately about the crops of the year. They have been used by grandfather since he was a young man! For twenty years, these four rice harvesters, except for Gui Tu, have all been replaced by their descendants, but this does not damage the trust between them.</p>
<p>"Gui Tu and the others should have come, why..." Because the time is urgent, Grandfather becomes anxious.</p>
<p>"Let's hire a few from the big bridge first!" says "Chang Nian".</p>
<p>Grandfather is unwilling to accept this. Twenty years of feelings and trust cannot make him do that. He looks at the golden field in front of him, sighs, and slowly walks towards the field.</p>
<p>Gradually, the village is filled with a strong fragrance of rice straw. Grandfather finally paces anxiously towards the distant official road and sighs, "Alas! I really didn't expect! Didn't expect!"</p>
<p>In the evening, an old guest appeared outside the gate, not much different in age from Grandfather. He wiped the sweat from his forehead with his sleeve and coughed. It was Old Guest Gen Tu from eight years ago, the rice harvester Grandfather praised the most twenty years ago.</p>
<p>Grandfather is obviously stunned, but then he is so moved that his voice becomes hoarse: "Old man, we are all useless!"</p>
<p>The guest looks at Grandfather with a sallow gaze and sighs, "Alas, Uncle Rong, hasn't your rice started harvesting yet? I'm sorry to you this year! They can't come!"</p>
<p>"Why?" Grandfather is stunned, and the dry tobacco pipe slides down from the corner of his mouth.</p>
<p>"Yes, Uncle Rong, they can't come this year. My brother... Gui Tu, passed away in the spring!"</p>
<p>"Ah..." Grandfather's sallow eyes shine brightly.</p>
<p>"Those two children are useless and have both become soldiers, Uncle Rong, that is my fault. Our few mu of rented land have all been returned. What can three mu of 'already tilled land' provide for a family of four? 'Forced to Liangshan'... I'm really sorry to you this year, Uncle Rong, I specially came to send a message because I felt bad, have you not hired any helpers yet?"</p>
<p>"Haven't hired... Haven't hired..." Grandfather replies absentmindedly. "I was waiting for you to come, Gen Tu, why did you have to let your children go 'become soldiers and eat grain'? Good men don't become soldiers, and good iron doesn't become nails, you you, does Gui Tu have any sons or daughters left?"</p>
<p>"No, he never married, he lived this life alone, I really feel sorry for my parents."</p>
<p>"You should recruit one back, descendants are important," Grandfather says, coughing, "Descendants... you have to send a message to recruit one back..."</p>
<p>× × × × ×</p>
<p>After that, whenever the rice ears are heavy enough to droop, Grandfather always stares with his old eyes at the golden field when he sees rice harvesters on the official road; he murmurs to his children and grandchildren about Gen Tu and his descendants.</p>
<h3 id="e258">Two Brothers (6) (9) <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Maupassant, Li Weike</p>
<p>She looked like she was going mad. He was terribly frightened, and suddenly knelt in front of the bed and said softly:</p>
<p>"Don't say it, Mom, don't say it."</p>
<p>She stood up with astonishing determination and willpower.</p>
<p>"But I have nothing else to say to you, my child, farewell."</p>
<p>She walked towards the door.</p>
<p>He stretched out his arms and hugged her, shouting:</p>
<p>"What are you doing, Mom, where are you going?"</p>
<p>"I don't know... How would I know... I have nothing else to do... Because I'm all alone now."</p>
<p>She struggled to escape. He grabbed her, he could only repeatedly shout:</p>
<p>"Mom... Mom... Mom..."</p>
<p>She struggled to break free from his arms, saying:</p>
<p>"Don't hold me, don't hold me, I'm not your mother anymore, I have no relationship with you or anyone else anymore, no relationship at all! You have neither a father nor a mother, my poor child... Farewell."</p>
<p>He suddenly realized that if he let her go, he would never see her again, so he picked her up, placed her in an armchair, and forced her to sit down. Then he knelt in front of her and blocked her with his arms:</p>
<p>"You must not leave this place, Mom; I love you, I want to keep you. I want to keep you forever, you belong to me."</p>
<p>She said softly in a subdued voice:</p>
<p>"No, my poor child, this is impossible. Tonight you cry, and tomorrow you will throw me out the door. You"</p>
<p>You won't forgive me either."</p>
<p>He replied with such fervent and genuine love: "Ah! Me? Me? How little you understand me!" Hearing this, she was so moved that she let out a cry, grabbed his head with both hands, pulled him violently towards herself, and passionately kissed him.</p>
<p>Then she stood motionless, pressing her face tightly against her son's face, feeling the heat of his flesh through the stubble; she leaned close to his ear and whispered:</p>
<p>"No, my little Zhe'an. You won't forgive me tomorrow. You think you will forgive me, but that's unreliable. You forgave me tonight and saved my life because of it; but I have to let you not see me again."</p>
<p>He hugged her tightly, repeating:</p>
<p>"Mom, don't say that!"</p>
<p>"Really, my good baby, I have to go. I don't know where to go, I don't know what to do, I don't know what to say, but I have to go. If I don't go, I won't dare to look at you, I won't dare to kiss you, do you understand?"</p>
<p>So this time he also leaned close to her ear and said softly:</p>
<p>"Dear Mom, you will stay here, because I want it that way, because I need you. You have to swear to listen to me right now."</p>
<p>"No, my child."</p>
<p>"Ah! Mom, it has to be this way, do you hear? It has to be this way."</p>

<h3 id="e259">Eugenics Law <a href="#e259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>— Non-human</p>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from Havana on the 20th reports that the German government's law on eliminating reproductive function is scheduled to take effect on January 1st of next year. It is estimated that approximately 400,000 people suffering from hereditary diseases will be subject to this law.</p>
<p>After reading this telegram, a thought suddenly occurred to me. Our esteemed nation, notoriously known as the "sick man of Asia," is renowned throughout the world. If this law were implemented in our country, I fear that the number of people subject to it would not be limited to 400,000, but rather 4 million, or even 40 million, would still not be enough. However, if this law could truly come to our esteemed nation, it would not only promote eugenics but also be a splendid plan for national salvation, as our nation's problems are often rooted in the mischief of reproductive function.</p>
<p>From the perspective of our esteemed nation, the most significant and common harm caused by reproductive function is the corruption of morals and customs. This is because our nation's maxim, "A wife is not as good as a concubine, a concubine is not as good as a prostitute, a prostitute is not as good as a maidservant, and a maidservant is not as good as a stolen affair," is deeply understood by our people. As a result, in court cases related to public morals, nine out of ten cases are about this. If Germany's law were implemented in our country, not only would the court presidents and judges save much trouble, but would our ethical teachings not be better maintained and preserved? This point, of course, is a very small benefit.</p>
<p>If we extend this further, with reproductive organs, the first thing needed is a family. With a family, there are children, then grandchildren, then great-grandchildren, and then great-great-grandchildren and countless descendants. If there is a family, then there is a need to maintain the family's economy, and therefore there is a need to accumulate wealth to maintain the economy for generations to come. If this cannot be maintained, then people resort to deception, plunder, theft, robbery, and extortion. All kinds of wrongdoing and crimes arise from the reproductive organs.</p>
<p>Especially in our esteemed nation, which is currently plagued by overpopulation, widespread unemployment, natural and man-made disasters, and widespread poverty, if Germany's "law on eliminating reproductive function" were applied to all 400 million people in our country, it would be a comprehensive solution. If the population were not excessive, there would be no widespread unemployment panic. Without unemployment panic, there would be less competition, theft, and crime. However, this law must be renamed; it should not be called the Eugenics Law, but rather the "Euthanasia Law."</p>
<p>The people of our esteemed nation have not studied other fields, but everyone has researched eugenics. Not only have they researched it, but they are also experts in it. If you don't believe me, I will give two examples as proof. Not only are Little Si Zi and Little San Zi in Hebei highly knowledgeable, but look at the women begging in Jiangbei. Not only do they hold one child in their arms, but they also carry one and follow with another. Perhaps in the thatched shed, there are several older children carrying baskets, selling roasted chestnuts or peanuts. As for the residents of Shanghai, in one lane, there are only ten or twenty house numbers, but the number of children gathered there often reaches forty or fifty. The output of this kind of manufacturing is certainly extremely abundant.</p>
<p>Currently, there are several compassionate and wise people who often lament natural and man-made disasters, often lament the ceaseless wars, and the killing of people like flies. I think if every year were blessed with favorable weather and the world were at peace, according to biological principles, there would be more than 400 million people, perhaps even more than 1 billion people, and the population would still be excessive, and unemployment would still be a panic. From this point of view, the demon kings who kill people are actually the true saviors of the world, so Jesus has his own reasons. Amen.</p>
<h3 id="e260">Christmas Gifts <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>It was the evening of the day before Christmas. Dark clouds filled the sky. From the seemingly low horizon, a kind of gloomy and desolate color was emerging. The excessive accumulation of moisture in the air was mixed with the towering annual red lights of Wing On Department Store and Sincere Company on Tibet Road, forming a pinkish haze that enveloped the entire downtown area. The cold wind blowing from the northwest at this time fully displayed its power, giving pedestrians on the road a bone-chilling sting; hitting the walls of tall buildings, it twisted and turned, emitting a miserable and sharp cry. This kind of cold and gloomy weather prompted the thought of pressing hard for repayment of debts.</p>
<p>At this time, the red and blue lights of the racecourse's red-lettered announcements had begun to flash on and off in a rhythmic pattern, and the long and short hands of the clock below were paired up and down, forming a vertical line. The streets were particularly crowded tonight. Every public bus and tram was packed like a lottery drum, filled with bipedal animals, and at each stop, it struggled to swallow and spit out piles of people. The cars, head to tail, each opened their dazzling eyes, and under the direction of the traffic lights, dozens of them lined up in a straight line, advancing slowly with their engines running. Cries of "Great Evening News!" "Great American Evening News, five copper coins!" quickly filled the major streets and alleys.</p>
<p>At the corner of the New Hotel on Great New Street, a very weak plea suddenly arose along the road: "Boss! Do a good deed! Cultivate blessings and longevity, many sons and grandsons, have pity on the poor... Give a copper coin to buy a bowl of congee... Boss! Sir!" This was exactly the set of "verses" that the beggar "Lame Ah Yi" could recite backwards, and he was chasing after a passing "gentleman" at this time.</p>
<p>As a result of the relentless pursuit and the increasingly rapid recitation of the verses, "where there's a will, there's a way," he brazenly received from the eyes of the passing "gentleman" a look that combined "sniffing," "annoyance," "disgust," "impatience," and "get lost," followed by a toss! Although it was only a copper coin, because it was thrown with force, it landed in Ah Yi's dry and chapped hand, but it seemed very heavy! This copper coin was labeled "No. 10" in Ah Yi's pocket, such an "unlucky" number!</p>
<p>Generally speaking, every down-and-out person nearing the age of "knowing destiny" has had a golden age in their past life, a time when they were "quite something..." Lame Ah Yi was naturally no exception.</p>
<p>When he was twenty years old, when he was said to be "a real hero," he had already climbed from "brother" to "logistics officer" under Marshal Wang, becoming at least a "lieutenant" officer, a platoon leader. He had fought more than once, but: why fight? Who to fight? These were too profound questions for him to understand. At that time, Feng Guozhang was still the President, and of course there were no such things as "punishing counter-revolutionaries" or "suppressing the communists." Once, during a troop mobilization, the marshal had given a "lecture" to officers of all levels. Unfortunately, this platoon leader was sitting too far away, and only saw the marshal foaming at the mouth and shouting, "Brothers! Fight hard! Beat that bastard Zhao ××'s bastard son!" A wave of "oaths" followed.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as a result of fighting the "bastard son" that time, Ah Yi got injured, which was the end of his "logistics officer" life, and the origin of his becoming "Lame Ah Yi." Afterwards, Ah Yi went from being a lane administrator to becoming the "street inspection commissioner" begging along the street.</p>
<p>Today, it happened to be the night before the "carnival night" of the upper class, and the ladies and gentlemen on the road were busy buying things; who still cared about the "lowly wretches" like "Lame Ah Yi"! Ah Yi started working at three o'clock, begging the bosses and madams, and now, besides the "thirteen taels" of copper coins in his pocket, he also had half a dozen cigarette butts picked up from under the feet of people at various tram stops.</p>
<p>He circled several streets, and finally turned from the New World to the Great World, dragging his heavy and weak legs, moving towards the Bund. The method of reciting "verses" to passersby was extraordinarily ineffective today, only succeeding once in ten attempts. Later, under the excessive gaze of passersby, he simply stopped begging and concentrated on looking at the displays in the brightly lit stores. Inside the glass windows, in addition to the usual Christmas scenes, with one or two white-haired, rosy-cheeked, smiling Santa Clauses and red and green Christmas trees, there were also various colored chocolates, pastries, piles of canned goods, and large and small bottles of foreign wine. The aroma of hot dishes being fried and braised constantly wafted from the various restaurants and snack shops, directly assaulting Ah Yi's nostrils. He felt that his long-panicked internal organs were not only "shouting slogans" at this time, but also beginning to "stir"!</p>
<p>The short hand of the Hendali clock on the bowling alley had already pointed to the number "two." His two legs, so tired that they were almost broken, dragged Ah Yi across from the Cathay Hotel to the entrance of the Palace Hotel. Inside the glass, foreign gentlemen, high-class Chinese, ladies, and socialites were embracing and dancing with each other in an atmosphere of bright lights, fine wine, and melodious music. Ah Yi couldn't help but stare in a daze, while also thinking about the "flower girls" he had played with when he was a "logistics officer." He unconsciously stepped onto the stone steps, stretching his neck like a heron, looking inside and forgetting himself more and more. Suddenly, an "Ah San" (Indian doorman) with a "mourning stick" rushed out from inside, "as usual" kicking him in the butt, while muttering in Pidgin English: "Damn you! Get out!"</p>
<p>Lame Ah San woke up from his daze. He also received a kind of "Christmas gift" - a foreign "ham"!</p>

<p>— Ding Ding</p>
<p>The early winter season has finally arrived, following the late autumn. Everything presents the phenomenon of winter. It is raining again, and the rain is not light. The sound of raindrops hitting the roof tiles is very audible. The world is so quiet, only the ticking of the clock and the gurgling of the water flowing from the eaves. Ah! It must be about eleven o'clock! Last night at this time was the last second after Ms. Wen's death. Ah? She has been dead for a whole day. Only her mother was at the burial. She is probably only twenty-two years old this year. Ah! I remember, my reunion with her after our first separation was on the evening of Fourth Road's ×× Restaurant. That night, because my uncle had just returned to the countryside, my mother and brother invited him to have dinner at ×× Restaurant. My uncle said that he heard in the countryside that there were snow-white young girls in Shanghai's brothels, specializing in lewd business... So my mother ordered my brother to write three invitations and send them to the tea room, inviting them so that my uncle could see what Shanghai's so-called prostitutes were. After the invitations were sent, we still talked about our own serious business, but only heard the sound of "woo woo ya ya" fiddles and clear singing from the small rooms on both sides.</p>
<p>A prostitute walked in, followed by a "young gentleman" and a "blind teacher" waiting outside. "Who is it for?" she asked as she sat down next to my brother. "No, I asked you to come and show this old man, go and sit next to this old man and talk to him." This was my brother's brief reply, pointing to my uncle. "Did your blind teacher come? Sing a song for us!" This was my mother's words, and so our small room began to sing.</p>
<p>The second "courtesan" also came in. "Alas! Why do you good women have to do this shameful thing? Is there nothing else you can do? You unfortunate girls are simply entering a living hell!... Is it one dollar for a call? Okay, take it and go." My uncle raised his old eyes and looked at the prostitutes, giving them each one dollar and telling them to leave. "Ah! These women are truly the scum of women, they are willing to engage in this kind of career, men's playthings, human parasites..." I looked at their retreating figures and scolded them sharply.</p>
<p>The third prostitute who was invited finally came. Ah! I couldn't believe my eyes: wasn't she Wen? I cried out. She saw me, her face full of shame and shrinking back secretly. Although it was only for a moment, I could be sure that it was Wen, my classmate in junior high school. So I remembered what a friend had told me about her. It was probably because her family was under economic pressure, her parents sacrificed her lifelong happiness, this daughter who was a beautiful female student, like a commodity. Because she wanted to save her innate freedom, she struggled and declared her separation from her family. At that time, she had an ambition: she wanted to use her limited junior high school knowledge to make a living independently! But alas: life is too harsh for young people, she was blocked everywhere and cruelly鞭策! So she entered the brothel and took on the career of her flesh.</p>
<p>It must be eleven o'clock, Ms. Wen has been dead for a whole day. The weather continues to get colder and faster, and the rain has not stopped, falling, falling, where is the phenomenon of winter!</p>

<p>— Wanting to Return</p>
<p>City Correspondence Two</p>
<p>Villagers;</p>
<p>Coming out of the newspaper office, it was already dusk. I buried my head in the high collar of my coat and stepped onto the sidewalk of Nanjing Road. This is a crazy world. Cars chase after trams crazily. The swift feet of rickshaw pullers are also exceptionally strong. The light of the neon lights makes people not believe that Shanghai has day and night. Even the blind female beggar who begs for a copper coin with a bitter face is unusually lovely. I want to go back to my resting place as soon as possible. I have no attachment to this world—this crazy world. I quicken my pace and walk forward, but am stopped by the waist of a woman swimming like an eel. She is so light. The lower part of her silk cheongsam is blown by the crazy wind. The waltz steps are so charming. I seem to have fallen into the embrace of spring; but the eel woman's neck is clearly wearing a black fur collar, so I try to raise my head and take a perspective review of this crazy world. In front of the fruit shop opposite, a female chimney made of lead pipes rises up, like Mei Lanfang's stage performance, surrounded by countless bright electric lights, a sign of Liangxiang chestnuts is powerfully imprinted into my brain nerves. I don't believe in the seasons of Shanghai. Is there such a big difference on both sides of a road? I was thinking about how I ran into this crazy world, and followed the beautiful lines forward. By the time I remembered that I came out of the gloomy newspaper office editorial room, the eel-like body had entered a silk shop. I raised my head and saw that their banner also clearly read "Winter" sale, at this time I affirmed that "Winter" has come, but in this crazy world, even the blind female beggar who begs for a copper coin with a bitter face is unusually lovely!</p>
<p>I quickly ran home. Villagers, my home is a small pavilion room of less than ten square feet. The landlord will not turn on the lights until six o'clock. It is already dark. I pulled out a cigarette and lay on the army bed I bought for three dollars. Then fantasy reflected from my brain. Fortunately, we poor people still have this right. For example, it is clear that it is a waste of one dollar, but the hope of 50,000 yuan can always make you dream of being a rich man for a few days.</p>
<p>It's winter. I wonder if the holly tree in my backyard has been trimmed so neatly? Ah Huo is a lazy child. When I am at home, he always has a share in all the naughty tricks. If I want him to do something, unless I lie to him that he will not be allowed to eat dinner tonight, he will not do anything. Counting carefully, I have not returned home for five years. Five years of time have turned myself into a fifty-year-old man. Ah Huo will not be the same as when he was thirteen years old. He must have already trimmed the holly tree neatly, and all the withered weeds have been removed, or he can already help the farmhand with the rice harvest. Ah Huo, this poor child, I wonder if he has been expelled like me?</p>
<p>The farm behind the garden is now at its peak. Several acres of farmland at home, if you think of coming to this crazy world, you have no blessing. In the countryside, hiring several farmhands to cultivate and plant themselves, life is still more than enough. The winter that hundreds of lives in a village are looking forward to has been warmly welcomed in the countryside before people in our city are aware of it. The rice in the fields, the price of a year's hard work, is piled high in the farm. Those who thresh, those who sift, a few small sparrows who feel that winter has arrived fly and gather in the corner of the field to forage for some wild food. They are all so unafraid of people. However, in Shanghai, there is a competition that is considered a shocking move.</p>
<p>Friends, it is said that Zhao Jie, who looks after ducks next door to us, ran away with someone. A little girl with two braids would also run away with someone, oh, no, Zhao Jie is also the same age as Ah Huo, an eighteen-year-old girl! But where did she run to? East Village? West Village? None of them can be hidden, so I have to ask, is Ah Xiang, the little cobbler, still in our town? He specializes in abducting girls from the countryside and selling them to Shanghai because Shanghai's sins need them to create them. Please tell me, or I can find this child in the pit of fire.</p>
<p>Fantasy is a strange thing. After the five-branched electric light is turned on, what is rolling in my spinal cord is that waist swimming like an eel, the car chasing after the tram, that unusually lovely blind female beggar, the small pavilion building seems to be spinning in a crazy world...</p>
<p>Twelve, at the Xin Sheng small building in October</p>

<h3 id="e263">Can Interest Be Waived? <a href="#e263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>I have a legal question and am asking you for your advice.</p>
<p>The matter is like this: Ten years ago, my father borrowed 800 yuan from someone to fill the losses in the store. At that time, he used the deed of a house as collateral. Needless to say, this money had to pay interest every year; but five or six years ago, my own store closed because it could not be maintained, and as a result, the interest could not be paid and stopped, until now, it has probably been five or six years. Who knew that the creditor suddenly came to live in my current house, which is the house whose deed he had previously used as collateral; no matter what, he refused to move out, and stubbornly wanted money, or wanted us to sell the house to him. As a result, he is still living in the house and has not been resolved.</p>
<p>Therefore, sir, please answer the following questions for me.</p>
<p>(1) The interest on this money has been paid equal to the principal amount. Can the interest that has not been paid in the past few years be waived, legally speaking?</p>
<p>(2) Because he did not pay him back, he forcibly occupied the house. If there was no explicit statement in the original note that he could live in the house if he did not pay back the money, can we now forcibly evict him?</p>
<p>(3) If he does not reason and is simply unreasonable, what steps should be taken to deal with it?</p>
<p>(4) If we meet in court, can we request that the unpaid interest for several years be waived, and the principal be repaid in installments, or reduced by a certain amount? (Because interest equal to the principal has been paid.)</p>
<p>(5) If he is sentenced to repay all of it, what will be the result if he has no money to repay it at that time?</p>
<p>Sir, as a reader, I ask you to give me a satisfactory answer to the above questions. Originally, I am very sorry to bother you with such a boring matter, but who else can give me an answer except you? So I do not hesitate to reveal my ignorance. I am grateful for your help. Sincerely, Xu Hansheng</p>
<p>× × ×</p>
<p>Editor's note: The Civil Code allows and protects interest that does not exceed two cents per month. Because the borrowing period is extended, it is legal for the interest to equal or even exceed the principal. Therefore, Mr. Xu can only negotiate with the other party to make concessions, and not rely on the law.</p>
<p>The original mortgage document did not state clauses such as "If the money is not repaid, you can live in the house"; and the other party actually moved in, which is of course his fault. Mr. Xu can report to the Public Security Bureau and request to stop this infringement; the civil part can be sued to the court again.</p>
<p>But in the end, the court will of course order the principal and interest to be paid in full; if Mr. Xu is unable to pay, he will of course request to seize the mortgaged property. If you say that the value of the house is higher than the amount you should pay, then it can be auctioned off. In short, once the relationship is broken and you meet in court, the debt responsibility cannot be reduced in the slightest.</p>
<p>Therefore, we advocate that Mr. Xu still negotiate with the other party, both the principal and interest, how much he can allow to be reduced is your advantage. There are three ways to pay after the amount is settled: (1) Still mortgage this house to the original creditor. In fact, you only need to take back the old note and create a new one, adding the amount to be equal to the sum of the principal and interest.</p>
<p>(2) Mortgage this house and borrow a sum of money from someone else to deal with this creditor.</p>
<p>(3) Since he wants your house, you should sell it to him reluctantly. When he is happy, on the one hand, he will allow you to reduce the principal and interest, and on the other hand, he will slightly increase the house price, and you will get much more benefit. You must understand that real estate is useless to the poor, and its interest cannot be as high as the interest you pay because of your debt.</p>
<p>P.S. To Mr. Tong Guohua: Please indicate your address, and I will reply by letter.</p>

<p>— Zhang Lao San</p>
<p>(39) Two Legs Frozen Red</p>
<p>This gloomy dusk passed like any other for the celebrities. They ate dinner, smoked, and chatted; but every action seemed constrained. The next day, I sincerely bared my soul to Sister Min in her bedroom. I knew Sister Hui was pursuing me and had put in a great deal of effort for me, but I was determined not to surrender to her. I held Sister Min's hand tightly, wanting to convey to her what I couldn't express in words.</p>
<p>She smiled—a disbelieving smile.</p>
<p>"Sister, remember? Now is not the time for us to be in love," I said, holding her hand even tighter.</p>
<p>She slowly withdrew her hand, lowering her head.</p>
<p>Three days later, Sister Min's attitude was as usual, with talking and laughter. Consequently, everyone's attitude also changed. When Little Huang greeted me, he waved a hand and nodded, awkwardly displaying the air of a burly fellow he aspired to be. When he was carefree, he always imitated Ha-Ha's mannerisms.</p>
<p>Sister Hui didn't come. Seeing how particularly intimate they had been that day, and the changes it brought about, I really wanted to get to the bottom of things with Sister Hui. However, it was better that she didn't come; I should avoid her and let everyone ponder this mystery and arrive at their own conclusions.</p>
<p>The ripples agitated on the water's surface by the stone had gradually calmed, and the water's surface, clear and blue like a mirror, returned to its original state. However, that stone had sunk to the bottom of the river forever. Just like the secrets of the World War, there will always be a day for unveiling.</p>
<p>This day—came on a morning when the cold wind howled, and we were awakened from our sleep by A'fu's trembling cries.</p>
<p>"Mr. Li... Miss Sun... is gone... two rickshaws..."</p>
<p>"When did she leave?" I opened my sleepy eyes and jumped out of bed. This matter seemed to have long been in my calculations, but I was still surprised by the suddenness of it.</p>
<p>"Half a day ago... oh... just left: by rickshaw." A'fu was like an old horse just relieved of a heavy burden, with continuous streams of breath coming out, showing the extent of the cold. "Oh, there's a letter, for Mr. Li," A'fu added.</p>
<p>"Did you hear where the rickshaws went?" I asked, slipping on my slippers, throwing on a coat, and taking the letter from A'fu's hand.</p>
<p>Little Huang heard this and quickly jumped out of bed, darting in front of A'fu, pushing his body and shouting, "Tell me quickly, where did she go? Tell me quickly, quickly!"</p>
<p>"Miss Sun hailed the rickshaws herself, and she gave me this letter in the kitchen. I thought it strange that Miss Sun got up so early today, and when I came out with her, she had already jumped into the rickshaw in front of the door and left."</p>
<p>Little Huang looked back, staring intently at the letter in my hand! An unsealed letter, I sat on the bed, pulled out a piece of foreign paper, filled with scrawled pencil writing. Little Huang slowly walked over, Chongqing and Xiaofeng also sat on my bed with dazed faces, and A'fu also came closer as if drawn by a thread, looking at the letter in my hand; in fact, apart from recognizing his own name, or perhaps only things like "Heaven, Earth, Sun, Moon," he probably knew nothing. However, he stretched his neck, looking so eagerly.</p>
<p>After reading the letter, I collapsed on the bed with a sigh. The letter was taken by Little Huang, who read it word by word, almost stopping his breath.</p>
<p>The cold wind blew through the window, shaking the room around us, making creaking sounds. I felt a chill rising straight up from my heels, I raised my legs, I had not put on woolen socks in my haste, and my two legs were frozen red.</p>

<h3 id="e265">A Roll Call of Fame on Hollywood's Pavilion of Outstanding Figures (Part Two) <a href="#e265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>— Xi Rong</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Achievements of Pioneers in the Film Industry</p>
<p>Six Names to be Inscribed in History and to Endure</p>
<p>(4) Charlie Chaplin: Charlie Chaplin is the greatest figure in contemporary silent film. His greatness lies in his ability to express the plot entirely through action. The agility of the muscles on his face, the stumbling way he walks, the trembling of his hands, are more effective than any words. He can make people experience both sorrow and joy, crying one moment and laughing the next. His performances can represent the journey of a lifetime. We can sympathize with his mistakes and share in his happiness because his actions on the screen are a corner of our daily lives. His performances transcend time and are eternally genuine. He does not belong to a specific time, place, or era. This silent writer has a special talent for portraying the misfortunes of the world's unfortunate people vividly. He gives the failures of the weak a kind of comfort, making them forget pain and worry. Because Charlie Chaplin can reconcile fantasy and reality, he has become an immortal genius artist.</p>
<p>(5) Marie Dressler: She is the epitome of maternal essence in the world. Beneath her clothing and makeup, her health, her sweetness, and her great soul can shine like a beacon in the night. Although she has had great success on the screen, it is minuscule compared to her even greater personal character. Moreover, her life's struggles, up to her late-life glory, can inspire endless hope and encouragement in up-and-coming artists. Many people, when they hear the name Marie Dressler, can associate it with a kind of tender love in their hearts. Her mature life philosophy, combined with her infinite wisdom, allows her to reach directly into the hearts of the audience. Even in her so-called strong-willed performances, her compassion cannot be suppressed. All of this transcends the skill of acting. Furthermore, Marie Dressler is one of the most influential actors in America today. She is also a unique actress in film history, maintaining her star status for many years without losing it. Because she is permanently loved by the people of the United States, her position is also among the immortal.</p>
<p>(6) Greta Garbo: This Swedish megastar's ability to be included among the immortal figures is not due to rumors about her or the various mysteries created around her, but rather because she can arouse the audience's desire while at the same time withholding it, causing them to develop endless admiration. She embodies a substantial temptation, but also, because of her spiritual restraints, suppresses extravagant hopes for close proximity. She flies to the world occasionally, but then flies away in an instant. Her position is inimitable by other film actors. Of course, the feminine qualities she possesses have made her a type that is popular for an entire generation. Therefore, the audience's remembrance of her will also never fade.</p>
<p>Of course, in addition to the six people mentioned above, there are many other big stars who have had impressive works that caused a sensation among people all over the world, but they are all inevitably eliminated by the times and sooner or later become figures of the past. There are also several other great figures who belong to the theater world and not exclusively to the film industry. We can mention the names of George Arliss, Lionel Barrymore, and John Barrymore. Because they did not achieve complete success in the film industry, they are not included among the immortal figures of Hollywood. Of course, there are many other names that could be mentioned in passing, but unfortunately, it is not possible to list them all one by one. (End)</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3 id="e266">Review of "Gallant Flight" <a href="#e266" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c266" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">266</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Night Flight</p>
<p>Produced by MGM, Premiered at Grand Theater</p>
<p>American films in the past have consistently focused on love affairs, but now, a very serious "Gallant Flight" without many love scenes has suddenly appeared, which can't help but make people feel strange. This may disappoint the audience who are intoxicated in the heat of love.</p>
<p>Everyone will recognize that in the context of a sluggish film business, producers have to do their best to call upon first-class stars. "Grand Hotel" was like this, "Dinner at Eight" was like this, and "Gallant Flight" is also like this. Indeed, when audiences see those famous actors, they will surely have great hope and go to appreciate the film.</p>
<p>However, good actors also need good scripts; otherwise, even stars who can act have no way to develop their talent to the fullest. In addition, when everyone is crowded together, the amount of film allocated to each person in the limited space is very small.</p>
<p>The screenwriter of "Gallant Flight" was indeed very solemn in his creative attitude, but because he was too solemn, he diminished the interest of the play. Of course, we never oppose the solemnity of film, but for people who are not accustomed to it, it still feels unfamiliar.</p>
<p>In any case, there are many commendable features here. It does not exaggerate the fantasies of love, nor does it cater to the audience's low-level interests. It focuses on the center of the story, develops in a very appropriate and positive direction, and has absolutely no perfunctory attitude, which most screenwriters would not dare to do.</p>
<p>We can see traces of different styles from their previous works in several main actors in this film. John Barrymore used to play very emotional roles, and also had a romantic and unrestrained attitude. Emotional roles, such as "The Mad Genius," "State's Attorney," "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde," and "Grand Hotel," etc. In addition, films such as "Svengali" and "Rasputin and the Empress" also have a mysterious power. But in this film, he plays a very rational character who tries his best to hide his emotions, which further proves that he is a genius actor, a versatile talent. Lionel Barrymore plays a role in this film that is close to a rogue, a confused fool, with an indifferent look, which is also rarely seen before. As for Clark Gable, Helen Hayes, Myrna Loy, and Lionel Barrymore, they still maintain the same style as before.</p>
<p>We feel it is a pity that they do not have the opportunity to act to the fullest. The most regrettable thing is Clark Gable, we can only see the curved part of his face, and there are very few big movements. However, in the few scenes, they are all very delicate and realistic. Especially Helen Hayes can achieve such results in very few scenes, which is really commendable. It can be said that everyone is trying their best to act.</p>
<p>All the techniques are very mature, whether it is lighting, dubbing, or set design, but it is not exaggerated, and it maintains a solemn atmosphere. In particular, the photography of the airplane at night navigating the clouds is extremely beautiful.</p>
<p>So why did the screenwriter use aviation as the background? It is obvious that this kind of theme is still relatively novel. Therefore, some of the knowledge about aviation or radio technology is also introduced. Naturally, this is common scientific knowledge, and it is by no means without benefit to the shallow-minded audience.</p>
<h3 id="e267">Review of "Hips, Hips, Hooray!" <a href="#e267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>— Moore</p>
<p>Although Christmas is a holiday for Europeans and Americans, in Shanghai, where European and American influence is strong, many high-class Chinese also enjoy themselves on this day. Moreover, because the places where they work are closed on this day, the broader masses of the lower class flock to the movie theaters. Therefore, every theater is very crowded on this day, and this cannot be used as a reason to deny the economic crisis.</p>
<p>Wheeler and Woolsey are two actors with the lowest level of taste, and also the least capable. The story of "Hips, Hips, Hooray!" is equally extremely boring. With actors of the lowest level of taste acting in an extremely boring story, the value of "Hips, Hips, Hooray!" is imaginable. Here, we naturally don't need to describe its story.</p>
<p>In the old novel "Journey to the West," we see the story of the Women's Kingdom. At the same time, there is a similar description in "Flowers in the Mirror." "Hips, Hips, Hooray!" is also such a story. However, the location is the well-known Africa. The complete fantasy of this story goes without saying. Its social basis, apart from satisfying human curiosity and stimulating the lewd fantasies of a few people, has no other explanation.</p>
<p>The screenwriter made it clear that this story took place in Africa for a reason: to take advantage of the hot weather in that place. Because the weather is hot, women can wear less clothing. Because the weather is hot, people's personalities are more volatile. At the same time, the heat of the weather, combined with the heat of people's love, can successfully promote "Hips, Hips, Hooray!"</p>
<p>The director firmly grasped the word "hot" in his writing. No matter what, he never forgot the word "hot." Therefore, "Hips, Hips, Hooray!" was successful in terms of atmosphere. It's really impossible to find any other advantages.</p>
<p>As for the performances of the two leading actors, well, there is nothing but acting dumb and foolish. Even the cigar that never lights, I don't know what effect it has other than serving as a personal trademark.</p>
<p>Carl the Mouse, on the other hand, gave the audience considerable satisfaction!</p>
<h3 id="e268">Hollywood's Christmas Preparations <a href="#e268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>— Bing</p>
<p>The annual Christmas holiday is now fast approaching. Those who eagerly look forward to the arrival of Christmas are a group of young rascals in Hollywood. Although they are very young, they will not forget Christmas.</p>
<p>Jackie Cooper is the most efficient child. He has to prepare 30 days before Christmas. Because he gives away a lot of gifts that day, if he doesn't prepare earlier, it will definitely be too late.</p>
<p>Babe Ruth is slightly later than Jackie Cooper in preparing, but he is already preparing his gifts about 25 days before Christmas. Among his gifts, the most valuable are those given to his father and mother, which are probably worth at least several hundred US dollars.</p>
<p>The children's interest is like this, and many older stars are no less than children. Every year on Christmas Day, it's like a stolen day for them. They can't help but make a wild scene, and the gifts they give are also very special. Charlie Chaplin once gave each friend a pair of torn leather shoes. This pair of torn leather shoes was as big as real shoes, like the torn leather shoes he wore in the films, but the raw material was made of chocolate. Jeanette MacDonald once gave each friend a book. The appearance of this book looked like a real book with hundreds of pages, but inside there were only two pages in total. The first page was the name of the giver and receiver, and the second page was a poem celebrating Christmas and the New Year, and this book was also made of sugar, and the outer book cover was exactly a box. This year, I don't know what new methods these many stars are thinking of.</p>
<h3 id="e269">"The Price of Love" Opens Today in Beijing <a href="#e269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>— Tian Zhang</p>
<p>The year 1933 can indeed be called a movie year. Not only did several large companies with strong capital desperately produce many new films, but also many small companies with weak capital and lack of talent worked hard to produce many works to catch up with the times.</p>
<p>Recently, Tianbei Company, a small company, after a long period of struggle, rushed to produce a new film called "The Price of Love," which will open today at the Beijing Grand Theater.</p>
<p>This refers to how a weak woman bound by the old marriage system of modern society resists her environment and lives by her own efforts. As a result, under hypocrisy and deception, a tragedy of loyalty and love under the capitalist system is created.</p>
<p>In the deformed society of modern times, the love that every young person experiences has indeed become an important issue at the center of society. "The Price of Love" is to provide society with materials for studying this issue, so this film is well worth introducing.</p>

<p>— Tian Fu</p>
<p>At this time, Lao Zhao was pacing outside the compradore's mansion. A sneaking rat was tempting his heart, and hunger was emboldening him: he finally slipped into the compradore's mansion like a shadow. Not long after, the wife, returning from a leisurely outing, had already leaned in the youth's arms and been sent back to the mansion by car, preparing to begin her sweet dreams.</p>
<p>(7) Thief</p>
<p>The compradore's wife was a little tired and needed rest, but a negligee was missing. Searching, she couldn't find it; she discovered muddy footprints on the floor. Thus, a small commotion arose in the house. The wife angrily blamed the compradore, searching the jewelry box to see what was missing; the compradore got out of bed groggily, blaming the maid for being negligent; Lao Chen's wife stood beside him in a daze, her face full of panic... The wife called the police station, and the police station then sent a detective.</p>
<p>"A negligee, a brooch inlaid with precious stones. Stolen after 2:00 AM last night," the compradore's wife told the detective. The detective then went to examine the footprints that the grumpy dog was sniffing on the floor. He then asked the wife: "Besides the servants, have any other suspicious people come here in the past few days?"</p>
<p>The wife thought, her eyes suddenly glaring at Chen's wife, as if to nail her to death with her gaze. "That's right, it must have something to do with her!" the wife said to the detective, pointing at Chen's wife: "Yesterday evening, her husband was talking to her sneakily in the gatehouse." So the detective took Chen's wife: "to the station to talk."</p>
<p>"To the station to talk": Although you can talk; whether they believe you is their business. You say you didn't steal anything? They say nonsense, you dare to deny it after being a thief! Anyway, poor people are not good people, you have to lock them up and fix them: this is the rule! Lao Chen really did talk to his wife in the gatehouse of the Zhou mansion last night, and this is a 100% major suspicion. So Chen's wife was forced to take them to the small vegetable market, and they arrested Lao Chen. "To the station", lock him up and fix him.</p>
<p>(8) Secret Under the Sun</p>
<p>It was 7:00 or 8:00 in the morning, and the sunlight was shining brightly on this bustling city again. It is said that all secret actions or crimes are carried out in the dark. Here we want to introduce a little secret in broad daylight under the sun. Of course, Lao Zhao's stealing is a crime. Strangely enough, Lao Zhao couldn't help but feel ashamed of his crime, but he was also a little happy. The person who "commits the crime" does so because he has "suffered" too much. When poor people have nowhere to turn, they often have to "commit a crime" to save their lives. Lao Zhao was so poor that committing a crime made his spirits much more active. The first job in the morning was naturally to go to the pawnshop to exchange the negligee and brooch for money. There were people starving at home, and countless letters asking for money had arrived; now he had to send three or five yuan back: so he went to the post office. The panic in his stomach had to be resolved. What else? Oh! Chen Da's younger brother was too pitiful, he was injured and had no money to hire a doctor; the suffering of the poor can only be understood by the poor, could he, Lao Zhao, not help since he had money? There were two yuan left in his hand, so he used these two yuan to hire a doctor to treat Lao Chen's younger brother...(To be continued)</p>
