<p>從前政變之醖釀。必先之以舌戰。函電往復相爭之後。繼以調解。經若干時期之調解。然後乃始揭發。今之閩變。則起於突然之頃。雖欲調解而不及。從前政變之發動。每限於對個人。對一時之權位問題。無論若何野心之軍閥。猶必依託三民主義。從未有敢抛棄國民黨之招牌。而别立一幟者。今之閩變。則竟以退出國民黨創立全生産人民政府爲口號。故此次變動。意義甚爲重大。前數日本埠。早此種傳說。但以未得閩中確報。未敢遽加深信。今讀其所謂人民臨時代表大會之人民權利宣言。則其主張。已較然明白。夫中央政府。爲國民黨之中央政府。爲當國立塲言。即此背黨一點。自已應赫然震怒。加以嚴厲處分。而無所容其猶豫。使閩省方面仍一意進行。而絶無懸崖勒馬之意者。則一旦實行平亂命令。勢必再起兵禍。吾人於此。姑暫置閩省此次發動之目標如何方式如何不論。而論吾國今日所處之局勢。則絶不能再有所舉動。吾國自近數年來。内則災荒迭告。戰亂相尋。而又匪禍徧地。農村破産。生産衰落日甚。失業人口日增。社會經濟日益動摇。國勢至此。危險已達極點。况又加以外禍之相逼。自前年九一八以來。國人無日不大呼救國禦侮。而侮之不能禦。依然如故。他若内蒙之自治。新疆之擾亂。亦在在與外交有影響。至於國際間之風雲。近愈緊張。苟其一旦世界大戰再起。則我國厠身其間。又將何法以圖自全。吾人處此至危極險之情勢下。惟有希望各方各派。各自摒除私見。抛棄權利觀念。力圖團結。内以整理政治。休養人民以圖殘喘之苟存。外以致力交通。開發邊地。以圖國防之鞏固。如此或尚有一線起死回生之望。否則譬之醫生。對於病人藥石之亂投。不審病體孱弱至若何程度。而貿然投以猛烈攻瀉之劑。縱醫者未必無醫愈之心。其如病人之不勝其藥力何哉。</p>
<p>閩省今日之舉。能博得幾許人之同情。使國家冒若何重大之危險。外交受若何鉅大之影響。主持者未加深思而貿然爲此。則甚可異矣。</p>

<p>職業敎育思想職業敎育想、産生的來源有二、一由於國内社會的需要、二由於歐美職業敎育思想的激盪職業敎育四字、首創的當推陸費逵、其後倡導最力的、便是中華職業敎育社、關於職業敎育的解釋、定義不一、黃炎培說「凡用敎育方法、使人人獲得生活上之供給及樂趣、一面盡其對人羣的義務此敎育名爲職業敎育、「鄒恩潤說、「職業敎育、乃準備能操一技之長、從事有益社會之生産事業、藉求適當之生活、其最大目標、在培養知力、意志、盛情各方而、而爲完全有用之人物、」講到職業敎育思想、在實際上的影響、確是非常之大簡直是其他各種思想無有的、第一是他在新學制系統中、佔了正式而重要的地位、其次是在實施上有很大的成績、自民國六年黃炎培等創立中華職業敎育社、以爲研究宣傳職業敎育的機關後、卽設有中華職業學校、從事實際上的實騐、其後風起雲湧、發展非常的快、不過單是提倡、提倡職業敎育、亦决不能就此解决智識界底職業問題、必得注意於政治問題、社會事業的方面、謀全盤一統的、進行方可、中國因爲是政治不上軌道、社會事業非常没落、所以　　乎職業敎育的思想、雖時時進步、職業敎育的機　、雖日日增多、而智　界間着的無毒問題、還是未得解决、</p>
<p>民治敎育思想民治敎育、就是德謨克拉西（Ｄimacraey）的敎育、或平民敎育的異名、發源於民國初元、而大盛於民國八年以後、其所以會得大盛的原因有三種、第一是外部的原因、受世界潮流的影響、第二是文學革命的影響、這時期新的思想儘量介紹、舊的思想也儘量批評、剛巧那時歐戰後的民治思想、傳到中國、大家監可不受任何束縛、自由迎受、第三是五四運動、這次運動底目的、雖然在於政治的改造、實際上却是新舊思想衝突的結果、杜威又於此時挾其素所研究的民治主義敎育哲學來中國講演、佐以中國文學革命的先驅胡適等竭力鼓吹、所以民治主義敎育思想在那時便盛極了、牠第一種的影響、是中央集權制的破壞、選科制的採用、及敎學方法的自由實騐、第二是女子在敎育上與男子有同等的機會第三是平民敎育的發居、第四是政治與敎育的關係接近、第五是學生底權力增長、上述五事、祗不過是民治主義敎育思想、在中國實際敎育上所發生較大的影響、詳細說來、自然不只如此、丨如青年底文學熱、戀愛熱、都和這種敎育思想有關係的、丨但就是這些、已足以表示這種敎育思想底勢力之大了、在這時期、擺在我們的前途康莊、只有兩條、第一是科學的精神的培養、第二是物質文明的提倡、引導走這兩條路的力量、自然以政府的敎育政策爲最大、然而敎育界的各個份子、未嘗無力量、只不知敎育家對於還事的見解、究竟怎麽樣、</p>
<p>獨立敎育思想人類爲着生活上的需要、不能不求敎育、又固爲敎育是達到人生目的之一種工具、所以無論什麽人、都需運用這工具、去達到他預期的目的因此敎育界獨立思想勃發、認爲無需依靠政府、於是就有「敎育獨立」的一種運動、先是從敎育經費獨立着手、後來漸因宗敎及政黨問題、在敎育上引起種種糾紛、於是乃由敎育經費獨立、推廣及於敎育離政治宗敎而在立法上行政上完全獨立、其實嚴格說來敎育獨立四字、聯成一個名詞、實在不大合理、可是在近代敎育史上、竟有敎育獨立的一種思潮、甚至在時間上綿延十年、在空間上充溢乎全國、其變遷凡四、最初因經費的拖欠而有敎育經費獨立的思想、後來則因爲欲敎育經費獨立、非先使敎育脫離政潮、不能辦到、於是進一步盛倡敎育事務獨立、更進一步盛倡敎育脫離政黨與宗敎而獨立、這是敎育獨立思想進展的系統、旁出這系統之外而成一氣的旣是敎師人格學業上謀高等敎育之部份的獨立、總括說來、敎育獨立思想、在實際上的影響很少、因爲敎育是國家行政的一部、無論國家採政黨政治或非政黨政治、凡握有政權的人、自然要　發表他政治上的主張或政策的、敎育也就當然要爲他的政策或主張所支配了、獨立云者、眞難實現呀、</p>
<p>科學敎育思想民國十年、美國孟祿應實際敎育調查社的聘請、來華調查敎育、力言中國科學敎育種種不行、明年再由敎育改進社聘美人推士來華指導科學敎育、於是科學敎育便大盛起來了、當時的科學敎育思想、一是由於外侮的反映、二是由於新敎育的不切實際的反映、雖然牠在中國敎育史上、綿延亦有三十多年之久、但是牠對於實際敎育的影響却很少、科學敎育在中國所以無效、有兩個最主要的因子、第一是民族的習性、第二是科學的餘毒、但中國提倡科學敎育的必要、恐怕除了謳歌東方精神文明如太戈爾一流人物之外、是不會發生問題的、我們現在雖不能在此討論實施的具體方案、不過我們可以决定他進行的方針有二、一、在積極方面、極力鼓吹國人、努力創造物質文明、引起其科學研究的要求、二、在消極方面、極力打破現在彩票性的官吏惡習、使人民不得不自食其力、以努力從事生産的建設、而間接發展科學、</p>
<p>非宗敎敎育思想民國而復、因内亂綿延不斷、敎育經費長久拖欠、敎育事業也有爲軍閥政客們所操縱、任便他們舞弄、以致固有的學校、尚不能維持、更說不到發展、而敎會學校、也趁着那時、因不受國内政治的影響、乘機推廣、在當時所謂宗敎敎育機關、差不多只有基督敎的敎會學校、故非宗敎敎育、簡直就以非基督敎敎會學校做唯一的對象、丨其實是「非」一切宗敎敎育的丨五四而後、國民底思想大爲解放、對於社會的一切、都以懷疑的態度、重新估定他的價值、大家認爲敎育是由研究發啟人類精神的工具、宗敎是强迫信仰、壅塞人類智慧的桎梏敎育、要脫離宗敎、方能表現他自由發展的眞精神、所以宗敎和敎育、是决不能相合的、那時蔡元培氏主張的美育代宗敎說、頗博得人們的信心、在實際上並産生了非宗敎大同盟非基督敎大同盟等組織、從事行動上的劇烈反對非宗敎敎育思想、旣閙得這樣厲害、後來又因政治上以新民族主義及思想上的新理性主義爲背影、及世界潮流、國内政團的激盪、所以結果牠在敎育上所發生的影響很大、政府方面、十四年一月十六日敎育部公佈的外人捐資設立學校請求認可辦法、牠的内容、一面注意敎育校的收回、一面注意敎育離宗敎而獨立、民間方面、紛紛亟求脫離敎育學校、自創新學、何以牠在敎育上能有這樣大的影響呢、那是因爲宗敎敎育在中國民族思想上、没有根深蒂固的基礎、牠底發展、全憑着外力的壓迫、和内政的紊亂、牠的性質、原是一片無根的浮萍、所以遇着了民族運動和理性主義的暴風雨、再加以世界潮流和國内政團的推波助灍、便不得不風流雲散了、</p>

<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>丨國貨生機誰掌握？大權端在婦人們。丨</p>
<p>國貨年中提倡國貨，我們總算極盡能事了。可是「頂了石臼串戲」，吃力不討好，所裨益於國貨界的，成績多少？眞是微乎其微。這不必奇怪，因爲一家之中，都有主婦，俗稱家主婆，採用國貨的大權，都在她們手裏。一般家主公，原來是口上說說，嘴裏熱閙，東登壇，西演說，凑凑，等於乾吃力，大家不信，請你到大陸商塲中國國貨公司站在門口，來來往往的人，看一個飽，究竟是家主公多呢？還是家主婆多？有時這班家主婆，還要聽聽她們的千金小姐，只要她的小姐香口裏說國貨怎樣她，怎樣合用，包管她們高高興興替那如花如玉的千金小姐來盡量採辦，實做那國貨的忠實信徒。所以目下國貨的生機，可說完全操在女太太們手裏。以後國貨廠家幾位老板，接起財神來，千萬不要接男財神，要接女財神，尤其是要討好人家家裏的許多玉皇太帝，還要巴結那各人家裏的觀音娘娘，和她們的千金公子。這不是我說笑話，我們一向的確走錯些路，便是提倡國貨不去運動太太們出來，是大大的失着。如果太太們小姐們肯直心誠意的出來，提倡國貨，那麽事半功倍，很是容易。今年總算幸氣，在這將要年尾時候，一道紅光，居然有一個好消息出來便是女青年會的國貨展覽會，他們的展覽，倒是一掃舊時的窠臼，完全以家庭爲中心。做成一個模範的國貨家庭，從客室，膳堂，臥室，乃至廚房，厠所，統用國貨來布置陳列，採取優美，經濟，安靜，衛生，樸素爲原則，以各人經濟收入之多少，分三種預算來布置。這種陳列，可以使人有研究的價值，眞是合乎科學方法。前天吾聽到該會董事余英傑夫人和錢女士說：「希望這次國貨工廠送會出品，要爲國貨運動而陳列，不是只爲自已便利而陳列。」又說：「這次展覽，不是呆板的，死的，是流動的，活的，譬如兒童服裝，婦女時裝都要想出好的式樣，大家來公同批評，公同研究，國貨才有進步。」余夫人又說：「上海上樂用國貨，關係最大，效力最巨，吾們上海婦人吃的穿的，如果個個採用國貨起來，風氣所趨，影響所及，恐怕内地人都要一律惟國貨是用了。上海人穿國綢國布，不出一個禮拜，包你蘇州人杭州人都要穿起國綢國布了。因爲内地人，可說完全的摩仿上海人，上海人有轉移風氣的力量。」這許多話都有意思。據說十二月十四日便在上海圓明園路該會開幕，這一件是國貨年中最值得慶幸的事情。</p>

<h3 id="c220">國貨與兒童敎育 <a href="#c220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— 巴玲</p>
<p>今年是國貨年，照理提倡國貨的成績，要比往來進步得多，這樣，顧名思義，也還適當，可是，事實擺在我們的面前，眞是使我們傷心得很，今年國貨推銷的成績，未見得如何高妙，而日貨却在市上大銷而特銷，國貨年却給日貨造了一個推銷的機會，寗非怪事！</p>
<p>嚴諤聲潘仰堯二先生都說，「今年是銀行年，」又有人說：「今年是擱貨年，」更有人說：「今年是日貨年，」眞是慨乎言之！</p>
<p>由此可見，提倡國貨，還要下一番澈底的工作，從下層做起，才會得收效，我們成人，因爲腦海中根本充滿了崇拜外貨的心理，所以宣傳者儘是聲嘶力竭，而收效殊鮮！</p>
<p>怎樣是下層的基本工作呢？作者以爲提倡國貨，須從兒童入手，須向兒童宣傳，使兒童的小腦筋中，自小至大，有一個非國貨不買的心理，有一個買外國貨是莫大的恥辱的心理，這個觀念，如果在每個兒童的腦海裏養成了以後，我想信，不出十年，我國貨不打而自倒，而國貨運動也無容宣傳，不提倡而自提倡了。</p>
<p>不過，這個基本而偉大大的工作，還是要我們成人們去做，做家長的應該天天向兒童申說。并且能以身作則，同時，做敎師的也要時時刻刻向學生們宣傳，而且也要以身作則，能如此，國貨運動才有完成的可能，國家經濟才有寛裕的一天，民衆生活，才有解除困苦的一日，否則，我們民族前除，是未許樂觀的。</p>
<p>所以，提倡國貨應該和兒童敎育相携手，讀者們看了我的見解，未識以爲何如？</p>
<h3 id="c221">青年莫再做洋貨推銷員 <a href="#c221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— 玄萬</p>
<p>難道在這樣的幾個年頭裏，中國市場，整個在外人經濟勢力的覇佔下，我們優秀的青年，對於這種侵略的滋味，還嘗得不夠，並且也不感到國内工商界的蕭條，和社會經濟的破産，而竟還有人在擅用外貨麽？自然，大部份青年，是都在輔助國貨事業的前進，走向他們光明之路，不過，祇有一小部的青年，他們是被可惡的現實，所麻醉，却暫時喪失了他的本性，去充當了洋貨推銷員，非惟於國貨前途無益，並且也就是復興社會經濟的障碍。</p>
<p>事實是這樣，大概這一部份青年的心理，大都是完全麻醉在可惡的現實裏，而虚榮心的侵襲到他們心頭，和社會環境的逼迫，自然，更足使他們的本性喪失，於是，西裝革履，（其實皮鞋和西裝，國貨也有的，但他們却非外貨不行），十足道地的來路貨，上下跳舞廳，酒排間，甚至於連電影也非外片不看，這樣，每年雪白金錢的滾滾流出，也就不是少數，國家元氣，也就多受到幾重嚴厲的斵喪。</p>
<p>我們在目睹着這一些矛盾的事實之後，我想，無論那一個人，都要深深地感受到無限的痛苦，以爲這些人的人心是死了，但是，徒悲無益，我們總要有切實的辦法，當然，這批人都是受過高等敎育，小布爾喬亞，或許還在都是大等敎，現在我們自然只有有宣楊國貨，來感化他們，不過，這種方式，尚須我們去討論决定的。</p>
<p>青年是社會中堅，我人未來之主人翁，社會屬目，衆望所歸，並且，這國民提倡國貨，也是自已的天職，這種責任及義務，當然是責無旁貸，無從推諉的，何况值此風雨飄摇，危機四伏之秋，我全國青年，更應如何聯合一致，力謀國貨之提倡，外貨之杜塞，而臻國家，社會之經濟，於最安善鞏固之途。</p>
<p>國貨討論</p>
<h3 id="c222">國貨代辦部前奏 <a href="#c222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— 端木祿增</p>
<p>服用國貨，這當然是國人義不容辭的：但是需要的時候，往往會發生出許多困難，例如採購時的不易辨别，尤其是那些喪盡天良的奸商，爲了自已的利益，不惜把仇貨改頭換面，以致使愛用國貨的同胞們，一不小心，就易悮購劣貨，同時又有許多同胞們，爲了住居的遠近關係，不願到可靠的國貨商店内去採購，即在就近的商店内購買，以致悮購劣貨；但是還有一種最大的致命傷，可以使國貨不能發展到社會上，和深入民間，即産消不易合作，在出産者方面，往往好爲迎合消費者一時的心理，以致不能持久；又有許多出産者。往往好爲仿造他人已有相當價值的出品，以致使消費者無從選擇；又有許多國貨者，已得到了社會上的信仰，而因爲不肯時時改進，以致結果仍失去了社會上的信任力；但是消費者主面呢？又不願將自已所欲需之精良舶來品，開誠佈公的宣佈出來，使國貨工廠得以設法製造代替品；即已有國貨代替品的，在使用時應如何改革，如何研究，研究後的心得，也不願宣佈出來，促進出産者的改良，以致現在的國貨不能時時改進；這其間，好像國貨與國人有了一種障碍物横在中間，互相不通聲氣，漠不關心似的，然而實在的原因是因爲國内尚缺少一種溝通國貨與國人的機關；缺少一種打破這障碍物而能做切實工作的精神。</p>
<p>照上面這種種情形說起來，好像是國貨界中的旣悲觀且嚴重的問題；的確，這是異常悲觀而又異常嚴重的問題；不過最近得到一種可靠的消息，眞值得使我們的精神興奮起來的，即最近上海已發現了一所專門解决上面這種種難題的機關了！這是一所埋頭工作，不尚空談，專門實施切實工作的國貨機關；地址在上海法租界華龍路八十號中華職業敎育社附設的中華國貨指導所，該所自從九一八後，因鑒於國難之日趨嚴重，但救國不尚空談，欲國家之强盛，須先從提倡國貨及指導出産者努力改進出品着手；在幾家上海的著名國貨工廠和中華職業敎育社合作之下，該所即行産生丁；自從設立到現在，所幹的工作除指導國人採購國貨，及指導産方努力改良出品及辦理展覽會，調查上海之國貨工廠内容，編印各種書籍外，最近尤格外注意到産銷的合作，和指導俄人購買國貨的工作，但是在過去的經騐告訴他們，要是没有一處實施的機關，先靠宣傳的力量是决没有好成績發現的，於是就毅然决然的辦了一個中華國貨代辦部，附屬於中華國貨指導所之内，據該部負責人談，籌備迄今，現已正式成立，專爲國内餐的國人服務，辦理代爲採購事務，本埠祇須以電話通知，該部即行派員接洽，外埠也祗須以書面通知，辦法簡而費用省，諒該部的前途，眞未可限量呢！</p>
<p>同時該部將舉行全上海各機關，各學校，各家庭，以及各個人的總調查，對於現在國貨界的感想改進意見等，將調查的所得，報告於各國貨工廠，使各工廠有所參考和改進，同時將産與消的二條線路溝通起來，使産者有精良而尤適合於國人所需要的國貨出品；使消者有精良而尤適合於自已口味的國貨購買；同時呢？該部尤可使國人不致悮購劣貨，以及購貨時的種種麻煩，并且又可得到極優待的折扣，因爲該部的每個細胞，都是全上海的各國貨工廠所組織成功的；假使讀者諸君有所詢問，該部定有極滿意的答覆。</p>

<p>組織賸餘材料交易所</p>
<p>目下努力國貨事業的，有提倡服用國貨，與製造國貨兩方面，觀乎服用國貨團體之組織，經營國貨公司之開設，製造國貨工廠之創立，其成績可見一斑，但國貨事業之發展，永無止境，吾們這一些工作眞是微乎其微，是當更須努力而擴張之，其尤爲吾人所不宜忽視者，則爲設法减輕國貨原料之成本：要知貨物原料之成减輕，而后貨物之價格得以平賤；至成本减輕之方，除增加原料産量，節减運輸費用外，更宣聯合當地大小工廠，組織賸餘材料交易所，此所或可由機製國貨工廠聯合會主辦，舉凡各廠之賸餘零星廢料均可向所中發記出讓，而需要各項賸餘原料者，可向所中請求代表集；如是一來，有零星材料多餘之工廠，如製罐廠之狹條鐵片，印刷書坊之各式紙邊，橡膠鞋廠之布條膠屑，紗廠布廠之亂紗紗雜線等，均可復生路而免廢棄糟塌，豈非得其所哉！另有需要是種原料之工廠，如賽珞廠之破布木屑，匣子工塲之紙片布邊等，均可仰給有所，而免收集徵求之麻煩，且無不繼之虞。是故賸餘材料交易所之組織，實爲一舉兩得，急不容緩之益舉，願國貨廠家，有見及此，而合作助成之，爲國貨事業放一光彩也。</p>

<p>談戀愛雖是一件正當的事，面且也是人住所必需的，可是戀愛進行的時候，兩方面當事人都有幾點很重要的地方是應該加以特别注意的。現在我們先不討論别的，單就兩方面對於國貨之認識而論，已經是很重要的了。</p>
<p>環顧我們目下的祖國，國難之深重實是無以復加的了。大好的東北三省，熱河等幾萬萬方里肥沃的土地，已脫離了我們數千年的版圖而給人奪去了。無數親愛的同胞，已在那邊做着十足的亡國奴，而且敵人依然還虎視耽耽的躍躍欲試我們這裏的同胞，說不定也有一天會遭受到和他們同樣的命運。我們趁這敵人的鐵騎還没到之前，如果再不拿最厲害的辦法丨丨提倡國貨丨丨去抵抗的話，將來是必然地也祗好做亡國奴的。</p>

<p>近幾個星期日，都是天氣很好，我們便利用來赴内地和鄕村去走走。常州，無錫，漕河涇，南翔，都是我們游覽的地方。到常州，看了通成紡織廠，很佩服池宗墨先生的毅力熱心，爲國貨事業努力奮鬥。到了無錫，看到許多高高的烟突，更佩服無錫人企業心的發達。到了漕河涇，看了滬西農場和淺敎社的農學團，纔悟到我們的生機，即在這種地方。最近到南翔，看了顧君錫元的振興農村副業恊助會，以改良織布爲入手方法，並推行種植菜蔬，養豬，養羊，養鷄，養魚等事業，我們看了織布工塲及種植場，纔知他墻上所揭的無廢地，無廢時，無廢力，無廢財的說話，不是空話。他的布機租賃及轉讓的辦法，有三種；一是一次購讓，計每座五十元，二是分期購讓，分四個月付清，每座五十五元，一是租賃，按月繳銀二元。布機發生障礙，由會派人修理，不收修費。織布之鈔，可向會中繳價（全部或一部）領取，或覓保貸取，織成之布，限五天一繳，布疋闊狹長度，都照會中規定，工資是看成品工作的優劣，及生産的多少，以定標準。顧君於本身事業以外，時時到鄕，注意到這種救濟農村的工作。可敬可佩。後來參觀葉友才君的生明電燈廠，他也是抱着服務地方旨趣而來。接辦不久，便有二件值得景仰的功績。一是燈光加亮，一是電費减低。他每月須犧牲四五百元，無稍吝色。並在附近辦一馬達廠，正在建築中，規模極大，翔地人又多一工作處所。可見地方不愁瘠苦農村不悉衰落，可愁的是但有守財虜，没有企業家耳。翔遊一日，所得感想如此，得句如左</p>
<p>羣說農村救，其如空口何？利人先克已，企業惠人多。</p>

<h3 id="c227">南通土布運動之始末 <a href="#c227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— 俞洽成</p>
<p>九一八的砲聲，震動了南通海門的社會，不祇對智識界激起了民族意識的衝動，而手工業的織布事業也受着極大的影響。因爲通海兩縣的大布是以東北爲唯一的銷塲的，自從瀋案發生以還，通海大布便管積在上海，布莊因資金擱淺而停頓，農村更因副業被摧殘而愈形貧困，通海兩縣大小市鎭的商業便驟然的冷落起來。這便是通海土布運動形成的客觀環境。</p>
<p>初期的土布運動，也便是改良運動，在機織方面，採用新的機械和新的方法，由民衆敎育機關加以提倡，在推銷和鼓勵等處，都增加了不少的力量。從城市到鄕鎭，通海曾舉行了不少的土布展覽會，宣備推廣，一時有澎湃的現象。</p>
<p>因爲感情的關係，在「南通人用南通布」的口號之下，改良布的銷塲很好，以致各方風起雲湧的購機製造；還有不少的小學敎員放下敎鞭到織機去。但是，生産和推銷都没有統制，没有多久，一方因爲感情的冷淡更因爲農村銷路的滯鈍，再加以同業競爭，不在質料出品的求精，而在减料削價，以致南通改良布的聲名，在没有替到外埠之前，便從勃然而與隨即驟然衰落了。</p>
<p>從這次南通土布運動中所給予我們的敎訓，一方面是感情的購買因素基礎的脆薄；一方面足以證明不合正軌的同業傾軋是無益。同時，都市中人對於農村副業的漠視，以及國布前途的悲觀，却也未始不是一件嚴重問題。</p>
<p>所以，這絶不是少數幾個人的責任，更不是一主面的簡單問題，我們要從人造絲的鎭壓下解放，不能不注意國布的出路，而中國土布運動的前途，在未曾對於許多問題總謀得解决以前，還得嚴防重蹈南通改良運動的覆轍。</p>
<p>最後，我的希望，熱望南通的敎育界實業界從新努力的幹起來！</p>

<p>誰都知道，我國是自古以來的一個農業國，農民的人數佔了全國總額約百分之八十八，所以農村經濟的破産，也就是整個國家經濟的破産，最近不是閙着農村的復興嗎？固然農村經濟的衰退，是受政治的影響，但我們也太自暴了，對於農民的副業太不注意、所以不但農村經濟破産，外國的農業副産品也就不斷中向中國運來，我們爲了提倡國産的農民副業品抵制外貨計，和補救農村經濟的緣故，須得多多的設置農塲，使他多多的出品，如蜂蜜、牛乳，罐頭食品等，更爲了促進農民的注意覺悟·</p>
<p>已久有此意了，想到惠康農塲去參觀，但一直到了前幾天才能如願所償；雖說是初秋了，但在晨曦下走，汗却是淌夠不停，是塲設於通惠路社橋西首，過了一長段的煤屑路就到了農塲，離開塲南十多丈遠，是華繹之先生寫的「惠康農塲」四個大字的牌子，場的大小，有二三十畝左右，四週園以很高的竹籬，進門後，最先入我眼簾的是一片很整潔而寛大的牛塲，塲裏有一二十頭牛在食料，牛身上也很潔凈；接着便是營業處和辦公室，東隔壁是裝奶室，一個穿着白衣的工友正在工作，牛奶從裝奶機裏放出，一瓶一瓶的，不須人的手指染到牛奶，確是衛生的；再東隔壁便是洗瓶的消毒室，洗瓶用的水，係用的是消毒藥水和自流井水，在這幢房屋的後面，便是新式採光通氣的牛舍，很是高爽而寛闊；自流井就高聳在座房子的東面，其他尚有冷藏室，鍋爐室等，没有一一的仔細的看過，而寶貴的篇幅上也是不容許我一一的仔細的寫出。</p>
<p>這農塲的創辦人和管理人都是農事上的專家，如華繹之高踐四劉平江黃俠民等諸先生；是場已辦的事業有消毒牛奶，白塔油，蜂蜜，和牛奶蜂蜜雞蛋三種混合的餅乾；該塲爲使這副産普及起見，不惜犧牲，低價出讓種蜂種雞乳牛等；在我國白塔油和蜂蜜等國貨，確是不多見的，所以也值得一寫，給各位關心國貨的同胞看看。</p>

<p>— 黃康屯</p>
<p>文學家丨一個Ｓ大學畢業未久的文學士，留着藝術爱的髮，嗶嘰西裝，白硬領，印度綢領帶，足登皮鞋。</p>
<p>織女丨一個蓬頭壯健的村女，月白布短襖，藍布圍裙，玄色布面鞋子。</p>
<p>文學家：（握筆側頭，沉着地在那裏想。）</p>
<p>織女：先生！可有黑墨借我染一染機頭紗？</p>
<p>文學家：只有藍的，没有黑的。</p>
<p>織女：先生寫字做文章，不用黑墨嗎？</p>
<p>文學家：我用的「放頓噴」，醮着「不留印」寫的。</p>
<p>織女：先生說的那裏話？我聽不來。</p>
<p>文學家：嘿！你看！（舉起自來水鋼筆。）我一向用這枝筆寫的，那裏要用黑墨！丨。你那辛辛苦苦織布，一天能賺幾多錢？</p>
<p>織女：不瞞你先生說，起早搭夜，織一匹布，市面不大好，不過千半把銅鈿。要是前幾年市面好的辰光……</p>
<p>文學家：嘿！千半把銅鈿，五毛大洋。……我一天寫千半把字文章，也得換三四塊大洋。</p>
<p>織女：（驚訝）文章！拿到豆腐店去換一方豆腐都換不到的，難道可以賣錢嗎？</p>
<p>文學家：文章只要寫得投機，比織布出息好得多呢。</p>
<p>織女：怎樣投機呢？</p>
<p>文學家：比方今年大家提倡國貨，廠家出了洋鈿大買其宣傳文章；只要你把國貨的好處說得天花亂墜，中國人應該個個吃國産，着綢布，用國貨；提倡國貨，怎樣可以救國，怎樣可以逼死東洋矮子……這樣寫了送去報館，主筆先生看了點頭，包管值錢啦。</p>
<p>織女：呵！原來如此。那末你先生滿口提倡國貨，自已爲何穿洋裝，着洋布，用洋筆寫字呢？</p>
<p>文學家；呵！呵！（作鷺鶿笑）我取它方便，體面。况且……這些……中國也丨丨</p>

<p>— 治成</p>
<p>（一）序幕</p>
<p>信不信由你！但是，這是事實，確不是宣傳或是忠嚇。事實勝於雄辯，放在你的面前，你又怎能不信呢！</p>
<p>（二）飛機到誰家</p>
<p>天廚味精廠撥捐一年的盈餘，便可購飛機一架；但是，每年從購買外貨的漏資，不知要間接捐助别人飛機多少架！</p>
<p>（二）非常時是本</p>
<p>日本人也在大聲疾呼的說國難，報紙上有極醒目的標語說：「非常時日本，國民諸君，應用國（日本）貨」。</p>
<p>（四）二萬七十萬</p>
<p>國際貿敡局報告，本年上半年我軥各口岸進口四萬三十萬强，出口一萬六千萬弱，入超二萬七千萬强；中國農村破産，經濟凋零的時候，還有如許的漏扈！</p>
<p>（五）摩登新解釋</p>
<p>摩登男女，是洋貨推銷專家，衣食住行，惟求洋化；據說，摩登的本身便是舶來品，盲從崇拜，又豈偶然。</p>
<p>（六）君是何國人</p>
<p>黃任之先生對許多朋友曾問過，「你是那一個的人？」現在，我們得轉詢洋貨崇拜者：「你是那一國的人？」</p>
<p>它方便，體面。况且……這些……中國也丨丨</p>
<p>織女：如今我們織的本布，關東又斷了去路；先生們口口聲聲提倡國貨，何不敢穿國布？免被人家笑說口是心非。</p>
<p>文學家：口裏儘管提倡，身上總得漂亮。</p>
<p>織女：單單口裏說得響，漂亮的國貨又從那裏産生呢？文學家……</p>
<p>織女：文人只會開口，織女却能動手，開口的人不動手；動手的人不開口。我勸大家少開口，多動手，四萬萬人不怕没路走。</p>

<p>五洲藥房出品的「美容霜」，質料純凈，香氣濃馥，能使皮膚潔白細嫩，不受寒氣威脅。並且價值比較舶來品便宜多多，一磅裝的大罐「美容霜」，只費九角五分，就可以供一家人半年的使用。所以這種國貨美容霜，人人都應該提倡的。</p>

<h3 id="c233">怎樣去認識國貨？ <a href="#c233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— 張孟昭</p>
<p>男女社交公開之後，彼此雖然初碰頭，却會一見如故的喁喁密譚，離别之後，兩情綣繾，他的腦筋裏有個她，她的腦筋裏有個他，大家有很深的認識！</p>
<p>我們的國貨，除掉三角牌毛巾，三星牌牙膏，立鶴牌面盆，人鐘牌棉紗，無敵牌牙粉，鵝牌衛生衫，國人還有一些印像之外，其餘差不多不注意了，現在我要談談同胞怎樣去認識國貨？就具下列幾點。（一）面貌粗陋　（二）質地堅固</p>
<p>（三）式樣愚笨　（四）商標實在</p>
<p>要去認識國貨，更要先去認識經售的公司怎樣，然後認識國貨，纔會獲到很深的印象，不致於茫然了！總而言之如果不能確定是否國貨？不妨信任上海中國國貨公司，他們鑑别國貨，是十分及格的。</p>
<h3 id="c234">失望之餘 <a href="#c234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— 壽</p>
<p>在這個復興民族精神，培養國家元氣的國貨年當兒，國貨廠商有如雨後春筍樣的勃興，實是令人欣慰的一件事，不過按其實際，洋貨依然充斤華市塲，不因國産品的激增而動摇其鞏固的根基，難道中國人都是盲目的洋貨崇讚者嗎？我不禁有點疑惑。</p>
<p>爲了搬塲，特意化了二塊幾角大洋，買了一把國人自造的彈簧鎖，其式樣外觀，着實不比舶來品「推扳」，我很滿意的把它裝在門上，並竭力向親友間大事宣傳。</p>
<p>可是不上一星期，那裝在門上的彈簧銷，突告損壞了，折卸詳細審視的結果，原因很簡單；鎖的内部的一枝螺旋釘，本來是壞了的，只經過短時期的使用，就脫離了，然而整把的鎖，也隨着損壞。</p>
<p>這是件多痛心疾首的事；誠意服用國貨，而國貨之粗劣不耐用竟至此！（雖只是極少數的國貨是如此，但這些害羣之馬，終連累了全體國貨的聲譽。）</p>
<p>可是話又說回來了，這個錯誤，或許大半由於工人的怠惰和没智識，廠方諒不致貪圖這麽微的利，使用夜已壞的螺旋釘，但對於出品，不加檢查，貿貿然運至市場銷售，也不卸疏忽失責之咎，小子失望之望，略呈貢獻於眞誠以提倡國貨之生産家者；提高工人程度，曉以大義，毋使怠忽職務，（當然本身絶對不可粗製濫造，存心欺詐）同時對於貨品更須嚴格檢查，切不令濫竽充數，自墮聲譽，果爾，則國貨前途的一線曙光，正未可限量啦！</p>

<h3 id="c235">日人懼怕蘇空頭 <a href="#c235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>在稠人廣座中喊一聲「日人懼怕蘇空頭」的口</p>
<p>號，誰都要笑歪了嘴，日人會得懼怕蘇空頭麽？假</p>
<p>使，日人眞個懼怕了蘇空頭，那麽，一二八之役，</p>
<p>日飛機光顧吳門以後，爲什麽蘇州人嚇的大哭小喊</p>
<p>，紛紛的挈眷遠避呢？呵呵！打什麽誑晤？</p>
<p>事實告訴我，並非打什麽誑語，日人的確懼怕</p>
<p>蘇空頭，但是，這個蘇空頭，並非軟語纒綿的蘇空</p>
<p>頭，却是蘇聯的空軍在日人頭上打轉。「蘇聯空軍</p>
<p>頭上轉」七個字，簡而爲三個字，這便呌做蘇空頭</p>
<p>。</p>
<p>日人對付蘇聯，海軍陸軍都綽綽有餘，惟有空</p>
<p>軍則相形見絀；在日人報紙上常有這論主郮，可見</p>
<p>日人不怕蘇海與蘇陸，所怕只有蘇空頭了。蘇聯窺</p>
<p>破日人的恐懼，所以遠東事務局發表宣言，略謂；</p>
<p>「日人在遠東開始侵略時，蘇聯的空軍，已準備决</p>
<p>心解决敵方人口最密各中心地帶」。蘇空頒的聲勢</p>
<p>這般厲害，任憑日人膽大包天，也該右相當的懼怕</p>
<p>。</p>
<p>這不是蘇聯虚張聲勢，英國女記者特拉蒙夫人</p>
<p>，也曾著一演文，說；「空軍攻日，蘇聯佔得優勢</p>
<p>；只因蘇聯空軍的發達，近年突飛猛進，超出日人</p>
<p>之上·蘇聯的沿海州，與日本最短的距離，不過三</p>
<p>百五十哩，遣空軍去襲擊日本，實佔優勢。倘在蘇</p>
<p>聯空軍根據地丨丨海參崴，使用遠距離摩託四台裝</p>
<p>備機向日本都市肆行空擊，這是綽乎有餘的。」外</p>
<p>人的論調如此，可見蘇空頭實有不可輕侮之勢。</p>
<p>日俄戰爭，頗有躍躍欲試的可能；但，首先的</p>
<p>一粒彈子，要從日人發難，只怕不成事實吧。爲什</p>
<p>麽呢？爲的是「日人懼怕蘇空頭」。</p>

<p>— 愼言</p>
<p>人生本是苦惱的，但瞧字典上，「心」字的一</p>
<p>部份裏，十個字中倒有九個字是憂愁哀憤一類的形</p>
<p>容詞，這就可以想見了！因爲有了這一重認識，所</p>
<p>以我對於那一班飽嚼了色白大菜之後，銜着雪茄烟</p>
<p>坐在拉水馬桶上亂嘆氣的大人先生們所受的感喟，</p>
<p>也極忠恕地認爲是同屬「人生本是苦惱」的一種表</p>
<p>示。不過，大人先生們的苦惱煩悶終究祇是片面的</p>
<p>，祇是屬於精神方面的，大不了爲着家庭問題，戀</p>
<p>愛問題，面子問題跟人家鬥鬥氣而已。若論我們這</p>
<p>些窮小子，那就不同了，精神方面的苦惱，自然是</p>
<p>免不掉的，這裏也無須多說；且把窮人因爲物質上</p>
<p>的缺乏而受的痛苦說一說吧。</p>
<p>舉一個最淺顯的例丨丨雨後的街頭。兩後的街</p>
<p>頭，當大人先生們穿着華貴輕盈的鮮衣，坐在簇新</p>
<p>的汽車裏，包車裏，風馳電製般的輾過那平坦的柏</p>
<p>油路的時候，窮人們正仗着各人僅用的一些物質上</p>
<p>的設備，在泥濘的人行道上跟風雨搏戰咧。披着雨</p>
<p>衣，撑着傘，没命望電車廂裏鑽進去的可稱是上等</p>
<p>的窮人；其次是略備雨具而無錢搭車的；還有，那</p>
<p>就不是大人先生們所能想見的了，他們根本没有穿</p>
<p>過皮鞋，下了雨，祇有赤脚，也從不曾披過雨衣，</p>
<p>下了雨，祇能用自已的體温作爲抵抗雨水的唯一設</p>
<p>備品，除此以外，他們還得在風雨裏照常的奔馳，</p>
<p>流汗，工作。</p>
<p>當你在雨後丨丨下午七八點鐘模樣丨丨經過那</p>
<p>幾處不十分熱閙的街頭時，你的第一重感觸必然是</p>
<p>那幾個赤着小腿，穿着很破很污舊的衣服的賣報童</p>
<p>。他們每見有一輛電車或是公共汽車到站時，便紛</p>
<p>紛冒着雨·打黑暗裏鑽將出來，用一種極度凄凉的</p>
<p>音調高喊着「大晚夜報」，「大美夜報」，待到車</p>
<p>子開走，他們便又縮到了可以避雨的黑暗裏去。一</p>
<p>面用衣袖拂拭着他們頭頂上的雨點，一面用一種提</p>
<p>心吊胆的神氣點着自已手裏所捧的報紙，或是口袋</p>
<p>裏所裝的銅元，暗暗在擔憂他們的報紙的銷路，要</p>
<p>給雨斷送了。</p>
<p>朋友，你家裏可有兒女嗎？如果是有的，而且</p>
<p>你是很愛護他們的，那末我希望你千萬别在雨後的</p>
<p>街頭，遇見這些可憐的小靈魂！因爲相信人的心大</p>

<p>常常看見報紙上揭載着汽車碾斃行人的消息，</p>
<p>有時還親眼看見給汽車軋傷的血淋淋的人們，但這</p>
<p>次却碰到自已的頭上來了。</p>
<p>事實是這樣的：前天我由家裏出來，預備乘公</p>
<p>共汽車去工作的時候，但我還没有跳上汽車，汽車</p>
<p>却開行了，我的手一鬆，車輪就從我的腿上碾過去</p>
<p>，「這一下我的腿斷了！……但還有許多事情等待</p>
<p>我去做呀！……」當我的一隻腿完全失去了知覺的</p>
<p>瞬間，我腦海裏還這樣的想着。</p>
<p>千斤的重輪從我的左腿上碾過去，我迅速的用</p>
<p>右腿支撑起來，我檢查我那被碾的腿還没有失去，</p>
<p>我眞不解它經過那樣的高壓還會不失去。</p>
<p>但左腿終於露出很重的傷了！我挣扎着趁上那</p>
<p>壓我的汽車，避開那些當把戲一樣看着的觀衆們的</p>
<p>視線。</p>
<p>我没有責斥使我受傷的「賣票」和「開車」的</p>
<p>同胞，於是他們便恭維我是「硬漢」「健者」，他</p>
<p>們說是像我這樣經過輪碾而還能保持常態的尚屬創</p>
<p>見。</p>
<p>去到醫生那裏，經過包紥以後，傷處</p>

<p>「不知而行」不是變了盲撞嗎？不！並不！</p>

<p>在現代的社會中，沈湎在煙賭娼或跳舞場裏的</p>
<p>青年太多了，他們大概是抱着少年及時行樂主義吧</p>
<p>！那是他的腦海中罩了一層薄霧了，生長在現代的</p>

<p>海行回憶</p>
<p>記得民十六年冬，由上海到檳榔嶼，搭的是日</p>
<p>本郵船「白山丸」。那時初次航海，由眼前的波濤</p>
<p>起伏，反映出小時在畫圖中看到一條條綠線紋的海</p>
<p>景；由漫天風雪的國門，走到炎威逼人的綠野：自</p>
<p>覺滿眼新奇。舟中曾有這樣的紀實詩：</p>
<p>「寒風吹我炎南去，脫却裘袍換白衣；滿座飲</p>
<p>冰開歲日，羅衫猶見汗微微。」民十九年夏，由檳</p>
<p>榔嶼搭了英船「伊靈勃拉」赴仰光，過麻六甲海峽</p>
<p>，入馬達般灣。船似摇籃，海如圓鏡。航行舒適，</p>
<p>無復逾此，民二十年秋，搭「海興」輪由仰光回國</p>
<p>，舶小客滿，船舷都無庶位。經行南海，恰逢颶風</p>
<p>經過，飄然似秋風撼葉，船客都偃臥若僵蠶。那時</p>
<p>靜坐甲板上，遥看海平線與天俯仰，却也别饒興致</p>
<p>。是年冬，復搭德郵船「谷勃侖」赴蘇門答臘，經</p>
<p>過馬尼拉，香港，星洲，直抵不老灣。十幾日的海</p>
<p>和中，那侍役兼充音樂隊員按時奏起的樂聲，兩個</p>
<p>意大利少女和兩個紅毛少年在甲板上赤着兩腿的翩</p>
<p>翩狐舞，還隱約留在腦蒂。</p>

<h3 id="c264">關於陳眉公 <a href="#c264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>— 尹川</p>
<p>陳眉公（繼儒）一生所刊「寶顔堂秘笈」，凡二百餘種，對於文化方面的供獻，力最可謂不小。而這些「秘籍」，他都很愼重的從事校印，所謂「余得古書」，校過付抄，抄後復校，校過付刻，刻後復校，校過付印，印後復校，然魯魯帝虎，百有二三。」（岩棲幽事）校事之難，以及眉公的精細，於此可見。此公生活，據其所著書，大約是頗爲閒適。夏天没有事，他就輯有關於銷夏的古事，成「銷夏部」；冬天没有事，却又於圍爐之暇，輯辟寒的舊事，再成「辟寒部」。病瘧了，爲着辟瘧更又大翻古籍，搜集老虎的故事，印成立册的「虎薈」集。這眞無怪乎他在「太平清話」裏，自負爲「小神仙」了。他自已所著的書也很多，所給予明末散文的發展的影響也很大，據「寶顔堂秘笈」所收，隨筆就有十五種，凡四十七卷；而「四庫全書總目」所載，還不止此數。筆記，除有關歷史，掌故、記事，記人者外，多清麗之作，如郁達夫先生所說，是「清新的小品文」。如「狂夫之言」裏的一節：</p>
<p>廋開府詩云：「對君俗人服，眞興理當無。」吕文靖詩云：「賀家湖上天花寺，一一軒窗向水開；不用閉門防俗客，愛閑能有幾人來？」予山中開門時，嘗以廋之詩謝客；客來時，嘗以吕之詩自慰。</p>
<p>雖然是「小擺設」似的文章，但寥寥數語，已經把一個田園詩人的生活思趨，反映得已是無遺。此公對於山居生活是極愛慕的，而且也這樣的度着。所以然能這樣生活的原因，大概是因爲他的生活很優裕罷。所以，有錢買書，有錢印書，而且一無顧念的山居。眉公在「岩棲幽事」裏，有兩節寫山鳥，山鄰云：山鳥每至五更，喧起五次，謂之報更，蓋山中眞率漏聲也。余憶曩居小崑山下，時梅雨初霽，座客飛觴，適聞庭畦，請以節飲，因題聯云：花枝送客蛙催鼓；竹籟喧林鳥報更」，可謂山史實錄。</p>
<p>余嘗過一山鄰，老而嗜花，紅紫映户，弄孫負日，便人不復知有城居車馬之閙，况京都滾滾塵邪。余贈以詩云：「有個小門松下開，堂前名藥繞畦裁，老子抱孫不抱甕，恰欲灌花山雨來。」</p>
<p>在這裏可以看到，眉公在山居時，如何的體味着山居的生活幽趣，而以一種詩的心情去承受他；同時，也能看到，眉公在當時的反都會的心理，反官僚主義的趨向。類此的隨筆正多，不再徵引：然眉公的生活，思想，以及清新的小品作風，是已經可以得到一回鳥瞰的。至於對於這生活傾向的批判，我不想有什麽話說，留給讀者吧。眉公雜著中之主要的，有「見聞錄」，「太平清話」，「狂夫之言」，「珍珠船」，「讀書鏡」若干種。</p>
<h3 id="c265">狗 <a href="#c265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>— 廖伯坦</p>
<p>舒老爺的親戚，朋友，隣近人有，都曉得他家裏有一隻狗，狗的名字呌做森蘋，是一隻非常好的狗丨有一次、並且在ＸＸ畫報上佔過一角。</p>
<p>森蘋的生活可眞也閑適，舒老爺愛吃的東西牠有分兒；舒太太去逛馬路，牠會摇摇攏擺的跟在後面嗅着：舒小姐的被「長髮披肩的詩人」歌詠過的手，會在牠背上撫着：夜間睡在沙發上，如果是冷，有天鵝絨罩着：熱呢，便睡在花圍裏的亭子裏，高興的話，也許睡在池邊的洋泥欄桿上。</p>
<p>舒家的人無一個不愛牠的，僕人們雖有些妬嫉，但愛牠也是實。</p>
<p>「牠眞聰明！牠眞敏捷！」在花園裏，舒小姐把手套一抛，牠馬上啣了過來，如飛的跑到舒小姐的身邊，並排站着，尾巴摇得可不夠勁？立刻抛，立刻又跑，你儘管抛，他儘管跑：你膩煩了的時候，牠也許還没膩煩：是不是故意裝出並不膩煩，那就非我所知。</p>
<p>有一次，舒家落了賊，正是夜深人靜的時候。誰說這不是做賊的好機會？然而却給逮住啦！怪麽？原來全是森蘋的力量！</p>
<p>爲了這，舒家的僕人個個受了一頓申斥：「養你們做什麽？養你們吃飯！我的飯不得變屡？要不是我的森蘋，毁啦！枉費人長樹大，不如一隻畜生！以後還是這樣的不留心，招呼你們的狗脅骨頭就是！」</p>
<p>「老爺又没呌我們當夜班。」孫漢說。拍拍拍……「你敢同我辯？」……拍拍……</p>
<p>眞的，這小子太没分寸了！其餘的僕人都說打得好。</p>
<p>是去年，舒　老爺的一個朋友莫先生發表了某處的闊差使，莫先生也是愛森蘋的，舒老爺趕緊割愛，親自送森蘋去，討莫先生的好可穩的！</p>
<p>但是莫先生可冷冷的說：「多謝！多謝！」一定不肯要。</p>
<p>舒老爺看莫先生的樣子是果然不肯要的了，没奈好，帶回來了！仔細一想，趕緊封了幾百「盤川」送去，莫先生才收了，推辭當然也是經過了的！於是乎舒老爺才明白狗到底不如花邊，而爲以後的森蘋不得不在桌底下出現的張本。</p>
<p>一天，舒太太們正在吃午飯，肉骨頭從桌上掉下來，本來麽？森蘋可不吃骨頭，但是現在，却是不得不將就將就的。</p>
<p>忽然「肴」的一聲，黑漆皮鞋起處，森蘋倒在舒小姐的腿邊；舒小姐笑啦，也一踢，就倒在嫂子的腿邊；等到森蘋知道不好時，一十六隻脚全動啦！要命！「肴肴……」越呌得凶，越「眞好頑！」好不容易總算「突圍」而出。</p>
<p>可是旁邊那位添飯的得富，也想凑凑趣，博得幾許笑聲，乃趕緊顯出手叚，屋前逼到屋後，屋後，屋後逼得屋前，還是舒太太看得不過意，才呌停住了。</p>
<p>小姐丨笑！太太丨笑丨大家都丨笑！笑笑……</p>
<p>「肴肴肴……」</p>
<p>以後，森蘋便一天比一天瘦…病了　　「再不趕出去，我們怕不染上虎列拉？」洋學生四少爺說。以後的森蘋如何？天知道！</p>

<p>又是一刀，而且「標的」依舊是我，這就有些不像是「凑巧」了。但自然這是好意，據說目的在「提醒」我；該死，爲什麽要「大驚小怪」呢！</p>
<p>但好意憑怕也還靠不大住。問題聽說是在「有没有只想剌　青年而以假話來欺驅他們的作者」。說來好像是我不承認世上有說誑欺騙的人物，大概這就是所謂我「忽略了的一點」，也就是應該「提醒」的。但在「青年的需要」一文中，我還記得有下面幾句話：</p>
<p>「何况晚近的前輩先生，也正有許多人，拿新的對象來代替紅藍頂子，作爲引誘欺騙的工具，把青年一個個提入囊中，敎他們膜拜，敎他們高呼；利用過了，便任意玩弄，譏笑，挖苦。</p>
<p>也還有不顧時代的需要，把青年造成和自已一樣的人物，動之以甘言，誘之以厚利，於是歐化者歐化，國化者國化。等自已被捧上雲端，便把脚下的青年一個個踏死。」</p>
<p>我明顯地承認世上有說誑欺騙青年的前輩先生，所以才對認爲說誑是「青年自已的需要」者加以奇怪。然而漫話家一心想「提醒」我，因此就抹去了上述的話，非把我當作「忽略了這一點」不可。現在（其實是老早）我可「說到這一點」子。</p>
<p>至於說「剌激青年」，我不曾而且也不　把剌激當作罪靠，去厚誣别人。我寫「文學中的剌　性」，就在表明剌激是剌激，說誑是說誑，二者不能混爲一談。但漫話家一定要說剌激就是說誑，而以我不曾痛駡剌激爲恨。於是這也是我「忽略了的一點」</p>
<p>這其實大可以不必這憾的。因爲在漫話家的名文裏已經有了。先把說誑當做剌激，接著就斷定剌激必須用假感情。（没有剌激（？）的名文裏是不是也有假感情？）於是這是欺騙青年（？），於是這是要不得的（？），於是就痛詆之了。但這回却又否　曾和剌激爲難。而我呢？則是旣不廳該「憤激」，也不應該「着力」的。</p>
<p>反之，「太簡捷了些」也不好。</p>
<p>大腿一定要雪的，乳峯一定要顫動，這非但没有麻醉青年的嫌疑，憑怕對於青年還大有裨益的。是不是？</p>

<p>— 英泊桑著李維克譯</p>
<p>渡蘭人告訴他本城有四個重要咖啡店怎樣願意給他宣傳，還有本地兩家報館答應給他做廣告，只要他肯送給編輯先生一些藥品。</p>
<p>經過一個悠長的沉默以後，瑪洛斯科問他的弟弟哲安是不是已經確定地接收了那筆遺産；他隨後對於這事還發了兩三個糢糊的問題。他對筆爾的那種含着疑虚的關切之忱，使他對於贈與遺産者的偏心，感着憤懣。而筆爾則以爲自已懂得了他所想所猜的事情，以爲自已在那游移的眼光裡，躊躇的語調裡，聽到了他那到了嘴唇邊上而不曾說出來的話語，這些話他是絶不會說出口來的，因爲他是那樣謹愼，那樣怯懦，那樣狡猾。</p>
<p>他現在再不懷疑了，這老頭兒在想：「你不該讓他接受這筆遺産，這事會要損壞你母親的名譽的。」他甚至以爲哲安是瑪賴沙的兒子也未可知。他一定這樣想的！他怎麽能够不這樣想呢，這事旣然現得這樣逼眞，這樣可能，這樣明顯？筆爾他自已三天以來不是以他所有的力量，以他所有的緻密的心思掙扎着，想要欺騙自已的理性，想要克服這可怕的疑國　？突然他又那樣迫切地需要獨自去想，去討論，去大膽地勇敢地毫無顧慮地審察，這似乎可能而又悟誕的事情，他連那杯覆盆子酒都没有喝，便站起身和那非常驚異着的藥劑師握了握手，重又消失在街上的霧裏面。</p>
<p>他心想：「爲什麽這瑪賴沙把他所有的財産都留給哲安呢？」</p>
<p>現在已不再是嫉妬驅使他追尋這事，這已不復是那稍稍卑劣的自然的，他三天來在努力克制着的那羨望，這却是那對於一宗非儅之事的恐懼，害怕自已也會相信他的弟弟哲安是這人的兒子的恐懼。</p>
<p>不，他不相信有這事，他連自已提出這犯罪的問題都不能夠。可是他心裏這輕微的，不能有的疑惑，總得完全地，一勞永逸地被抛去才行。他對於這事非澈底明白並有把握不行，他心裏非得到絶對的安全不行，因爲他在這世界上就祇歡喜他母親一人啊。</p>
<p>他一面獨自在黑夜中游蕩着，一面想要在他的回憶裏，在他的理性裡，作一番細密的偵查，由這偵查的結果，他便可以得到燦爛的眞理。這麽都完了，他不會再去想它了，永遠不會去想了。他便可去安睡了。</p>
<p>他想道：「來，我們先來檢查事實；然後我再記臆起我所知道的關於他的一切，他對我的弟弟和我的態度，我可以搜求一切使他發生這種偏愛的原因……他看見哲安出生？丨對啦，可是他認識我在前。丨倘使他曾以一種沉默且謹愼的母親的話，那麽他應當比較喜歡我才對，因爲虧着我，虧着我的猩紅熱，他才成了我父母的密友啊，那麽，論理地說來，他看着我的弟弟長大時，除非他對於他感着一種吸引，一種本能的偏愛，他是廳該選中我，對於我比較的疼得熱烈些才對。」</p>

<h3 id="c270">爲諾貝爾和平奬金停發異議 <a href="#c270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>— 韋拔</p>
<p>以發明炸藥起家的諾貝爾，爲懺悔他生前所造下的孽，死後曾有遺囑，將全部財産組織一保管委員會，設立物理，化學，文學等奬金，每年由委員會選取世界一年中對於各該科學術有貢獻的人物奬與之。其中有「和平奬金」一個，是氏懺悔其創造殺人的利器，特指定奬與對世界和平運動有貢獻的人物的，歷屆的得者，如威爾生，白里安等，俱爲國際政治舞臺上的要角，以贊助和平著名的。</p>
<p>今年的奬金，前曾傳聞有爲到處締結「不侵犯條約」的蘇聯外交部長李維諾夫所得的希望。但最近據哈瓦斯社電稱，則今年的「和平奬金」已由諾貝爾奬金委員會議决，「暫停贈給」，報紙標題，更有冠以「世界不和平之徵」的字樣。見本月十六日報）這在關懷世界和平，尤其是愛好和平滲入骨裏的中國人民聽來，是怎樣剌耳的一個消息！</p>
<p>關於歐美以及遠東各國積極備戰的情形，是無庸諱言的，但倘爲着三五强國的好勇鬭狠，而遂抹煞了一切，指全世界十六億人口中，無一人想保留這「和平」兩字的，却也非事實。</p>
<p>這裏不舉别的，單說我們貴中華民國前陸海空軍張副司令，就夠得上一百個和平奬金的資格。試問歷來談和一站，都不過是簽一紙文書，訂幾條條約，成爲紙上談兵而已，那能如我們少爺的爲「保障遠東和平計」，一手而奉送了東北四省的土地。現在身雖遨遊海外，其功在國際，較之白里安輩所爲的「泛歐同盟」等等，尤爲實在，决不可掩没。倘以雇行「他要什麽，就給他什麽」的不抵抗主義的代表人，尚不能博得和平的令譽與區區奬金，那麽「和平」兩字，眞該永遠在字典須註銷了。爲此鄙人特提出異議，今年的和平奬金，應贈給咱們少帥，以壯行色，而銷羣疑。</p>

<p>— 一琴</p>
<p>我的鄰居新近裝了一架無線電收音機，於是我的耳朶也沾了光，早晚在即噪音騷擾中過日子了。</p>
<p>現在且將每天早晚從墻外飛來的「福音」說一說。</p>
<p>早上。當你還睡在被窩裏的時候，聽的是「金剛經」，閣閣的木魚韾，從遮不斷的壁縫裏透過來，直送到你枕上。有時是一人曼聲長吟，有時是衆音哄然大作，外加鐘鼓磐鈸，閙得你頭昏腦脹，究不知有幾個秃驢在誰家電台搗鬼。而且時間來得特别長，約繼續有一時之久，這樣使你不得不起來。等到經懺念完，接着是妖聲怪氣，没精打彩的「摇摇…………寶貝要睡覺…………」一類的寶貝歌曲，使流醒人聽了喪氣，糊塗虫聽了一直睡去的歌曲，大約唱過一二支，時間已有八九點鐘了，我就像逃出樊籠一般的上我辦事的地方去。再接下去唱的是什麽，我就不知道了。</p>
<p>但一等到晚上還來，你的耳福也還來了。因爲從這時期到睡覺，時間較長，所以節目聽得也特别多。但細說起來，却也簡單得很。是平劇，申曲，申曲，平劇，哭妙根篤爺，哭孫中山，哭王旡能，以及活捉張三郎等，尤哭的藝術，欣賞得最多，也最不給我好感。其次便是如將次入睡時的囈語一般的申曲，與「阿唷喂！我的三郎哥哥呀……」的江北調的活捉張三郎爲致討厭。平劇則初聽一二句，似乎有清明之感，但倘繼續喊上一點或半點鐘，那麽也會使你頭痛的。</p>
<p>這樣，早上聽念經，晚上聽哭聲，竟像上課似的，我已上了一星期多了。他家欣賞雖未厭，我却有點頭痛了。</p>
<p>論理他家開無綫電，我本無權利聽；但空間是隔不斷的，我就不得不盡義務聽。早晚本是我自已寫作的時間，現在給這樣哀樂具陳，金鼓齊備的一閙，使我不能不擱筆了。對付的方法，只有二種；一種是向被裏一鑽，埋頭不聽一切音；一種是跑到朋友家裏去談，實行逃避政策。結果大都是兩者並用，就是先到朋友人家談天，直談到夜深才歸來睡覺。可是時間是白去了，眞是「啞子吃黃連，說不出的苦。」這筆損失賬，我又向誰算呢？要是長此下去，我眞非搬家不可。</p>
<p>所不懂的，人之聽覺竟有如此不同。孟老夫子說「耳之於聲也，有同聽焉」。怕不見得是眞理吧？其次說欣賞吧，聲音的種類，也至繁且夥，而竟下賞及於念經，哭泣，眞可謂無聊之尤，這大概是所謂「上海氣」吧！無綫電爲文明的利器，科學的結晶，却使中國人如此濫用，以傳佈最迷信的念經禮懺，不可謂非奇遇了。無綫電發明家屬可尼，說將來中國，不知他見　這種現象，將作何感想，有機會倒要問問他。（完）</p>
<h3 id="c272">「毛毛雨」及其他 <a href="#c272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>— 立齋</p>
<p>前不久，南京市政府曾通令取締兩種歌曲：「毛毛雨」和「妹妹我愛你」：接着上海市敎育局又奉着市政府准内政部咨的命令，取締「神怪淫穢小人書畫」丨即連環圖畫。這兩件，雖然都是被許多大人先生或摩登男女們視爲「無關宏旨」的「小事」，但的確是現政府關心「民風」和「大衆文藝」的「處女作」；所以不管就那一方面說，都值得「論」他一下。</p>
<p>南京市政府取締「毛毛雨」和「妹妹我愛你」的「理由」，是爲了「維持風化」。我不是「毛毛雨」的「忠實同志「，所以絶不想在這裏胡謅一番「道理」來爲之「張目」一下。不過經了這一番取締，使我聯想到兩點：</p>
<p>第一，「毛毛雨」及其儔類，確然有應該失去其空間與時間的理由，但「風化」不在其内。因爲所謂「風化」也者，其涵義，解釋和作用，都是聚訟不一，大成問題。何况，像若干新貴或「老英雄「之大捧其「國劇」和特種國貨的「雄婦人」以及大批掛徽章駁彀搶的人經常集中在夫子廟戲，捧「歌星」和怪聲呌好，其有關「風化」和應受取締的程度，都較「毛毛雨」爲多。所以拿「風化」的令箭去進攻「毛毛雨」，「毛毛雨」是未嘗没有足「抵抗」之盾牌的。</p>
<p>第二，當「毛毛雨」没有問世之前，「打牙牌」，「泗州調」，「孟姜女」等曲子在許多省區有十幾年度之新陳代謝，家喻户曉的流行，差不多成爲中下級社會的「國歌」。及至「毛毛雨」風行海内，那些歌曲始由「時代落伍」而漸趨式微。但是「毛毛雨」是甚麽？就音節講，是一種令人與倦的靡靡之音；如果「歌爲心聲」的話是對的，則「毛毛兩」正是粧「不抵</p>

<p>抗」與「國畜」而爲一的没落社會層之精神生活的反映！就内容講，恰正是一種活屍之靈魂的自訴，懵懵昏昏，毫無生命的力量。這種歌曲竟在中國獲得不脛而走的市塲，正是說明中國有閑階級之日暮途遠之頽廢情緒，恰受着我們「譜曲家」之打動心弦的彈奏。撇開一切烏「風化」的怪論，我認爲在「怒吼罷，中國」之偉大的時代來到以前，「毛毛雨」及其同類，都當然應該被楊棄到最便於遺忘的地方去。可是，我們却决不能用「窩窩頭或棒子麫吃了太不衛生，還是辟榖罷」之「國畜」式的辦法，只是消極地反對「毛毛雨」，並不積極地注意創造何種的代用品。所以，創作並譜出一批内容豐富，形式優美，音節鏗鏘的歌曲來代替「毛毛雨」一類的靡靡之音，是現時的前進作家，尤其是音樂家們的要任務之一。</p>
<p>對於連環圖畫的取締，我們自無異議，不過問題也是和「毛毛雨」一樣：拿甚麽東西來代替？舉凡二十本連台的彭公案，狸貓換太子，封神榜等等的「國劇」，「鐵布衫眞傳」，「張三峯鍊丹秘訣」等類的「武術經典」，尊孔復古的倒車文化，以及這裏所談的連環圖畫……都是以中國封建社會之廢墟爲存在基礎「七子八婿。我們對於這些封建文化的殘滓，都不應止是與以消極否定，同時都必須要有積極方面之「拔幟易趙的努力。否則，在社會羣衆精神生活之實際的需要下面，只是不准接觸某種書畫或歌典，並没有相當的東西來代替，結果一切取締和查禁，都將成爲空談。各種連台戲的經常客滿和連環圖畫並不因一紙查禁的命令而稍殺流行之勢，就是明證</p>

<p>— 光漢</p>
<p>萬能的上帝，僅僅是萬能而已，終竟還夠不上稱爲「完善」。旣造人矣，偏又故意似的給你安排些五臟六腑之類，於是凡人總不得不吃飯。因爲食物不能盡化成血液，於是吃飯又免不了要拉矢。這是何等麻煩之至！人生便起始乎吃拉，也就在吃拉之下大團圓！</p>
<p>人，說偉大點，是世間的主宰，征服一切，支配一切，又創造一切；說渺小些，不過是一架消化器，只能司理吃飯拉矢的作用。生機就很微弱，一隻蚯蚓給斬斷了，不久自會變成二條，蠕蠕而動；人則有時偶被半塊由簷然墮下來的磚瓦打中，立刻「魂歸隂府」！</p>
<p>生理學家告訴我們，吃飯拉矢是人的本能，先天的，脫出娘肚就會；這給我們許多方便，無須再學。可恨上帝只賦與人們吃拉的技術，至「由拉到口」的工夫，還得讓自家費若干氣力去習練。　　一樣人也，吃飯拉矢的本領，雖無甚軒輊；取得飯吃的手段，就大有高低。有的幾乎可以「不勞而獲」，有的必待「勞而後獲」，還有的却「勞而亦難獲」。不勞而獲，顯然是「得非其所應得」；勞而後獲，算是「取之有道」；至勞而亦難獲，這無疑是「被剥削」。由是世事就不平了！</p>
<p>如果社會上「人飯相等」，或「人少飯多」，那就好極了；但事情恰相反，「人多飯少」，這才糟糕！因爲人多飯少，不敷分配，就不免出於一爭。爭的結局是决勝負。勝者自然有得吃，負者就該挨餓！誰敎你不拚命？許有人要大講其道理，說「生存是天賦的特權」，個個都應有飯吃，豈容你爭我奪，成什麽世界？這只好請「君其問諸彼蒼」！</p>
<p>關於飯少人多，好事之徒胡猜亂測，以爲不是生産不足，便是給有些强蠻者多搶了去。没有根據的話是非科學的，這猜測果然不中。現時社會上的生産，不是正閙着過剩，不足云乎哉？若誣爲被人佔奪，也像有幾分寃枉，應該怪到人口增加過速上面去才妥當。</p>
<p>吃飯易，得飯難，這是眼前的景象。解决的良方，旣尚没人開示出來；等候飯吃的同志，只有快把腰帶束緊些！横豎少吃飯也就少拉矢，得失兩訖，何樂而不爲？</p>
<p>和食並重的，還有一件事，那就是色。人們没得飯吃，當然，活不下去；缺乏性的調和，也難過日子。至食色的功用，除了維持個體的生命，及綿延種族的存續，對於一切文化，還有着莫大的助力。人們創造文化的基因，多半是建立在這兩種行爲之上。可是由另一方面看，社會上各種罪惡的發生，也無非是因此活動而引起的了。</p>

<p>— 張老三</p>
<p>（一）橋下的流水</p>
<p>春風中送來了佈榖鳥的聲音，我携着弟弟的手，踏着每天走熟了的小路，向爸爸媽媽的墳墓走去。在田間工作的農夫，老是對我們微笑；或者問一句一吃過了早飯没有？」的粗話。走完田隴，便是一頂小橋，流水在橋下帶着落花走：從這邊過來，到那邊去，每天這樣，每年這樣。弟弟踏着輕鬆的脚步，跳上橋頂，拾起細小的石子，向河中投去，水面上波動着　漣，隨了落花，慢慢地消滅。小橋左側，就是我家的墳墓，因爲年久失修，已頽毁得不成模樣。從橋上望去，僅見幾個土饅頭而已。</p>
<p>剛步下小橋，好像一條人影從傾毁的門前掠過，我們鄕下，常有小竊倫人家墳上的松柏，那是指富麗堂皇的新建築：漆黑的墳墻，三五間有瓦蓋的小屋，松柏參天，新土煥然。如像我們這樣僅有四五株秃幹的死松，也會被竊小所注意嗎？我間弟弟，他也看見，而且好像一個女人的後影。我們向四面觀望。除了儘是土饅頸外，惟有無家可躱的小狗仰臥在草地上對太陽揮動牠的四肢，</p>
<p>在墳前，向草地上一躺，望着飛跑的白雲，弟兄兩個不則一聲。大約午飯的時候，再踏着熟悉的路歸去，每天這樣，每年這樣。今天雖然同樣的向草地上一躺，但是明顯地有一種異樣的情緒，開展在靜默的大自然中。白雲飛遇，春風裏送來了佈榖鳥的聲音；我望望弟弟天眞的蘋菓臉，望望兩個土饅頭上青草，清涙已潤濕了睫毛，對於自已昨夜定的計劃，好像抱歉似的摇動了。弟弟也知道有特殊的事情將發生，已没有跳上小橋的活潑態度，但是誰也不願先打破這嚴重的局面。日影慢慢正中，互相投了會意的目光，站起身來步過小橋歸去。橋下的流水，還是帶着落花無盡止的流。</p>
<p>（二）新的開始</p>
<p>踏出校門，我呼吸着另一種空氣時，曾喊過「新的開始」，誰料「新的開始」會這樣的發展！吃了一年多不願吃的飯：過了一年多不願過的生活。如今已是個沙漠中的孤獨者，那裏是我的出路，那裏是我没有顧慮到，也不能顧慮到，盡我的力，奔我的前程，找我而要的光明。</p>
<p>疲乏了一天，到這時候還没有睡意，大概太興奮了吧。車上的旅客，都微笑地做着好夢，我羨墓他們，雖然各人不知各人的事，姑母走的時候，我還簽應着明天到她家去呢，現在已離故鄕百里的征途上了。</p>
<p>弟弟醒來時，見了字條，不知怎樣的悲傷，從墳墓歸來，我微微地吐了我的意思，聰明的弟弟，當然知道我有出走的預兆，不過今晚上就不别而行：我記起了爸爸臨死時，握住我的手，囑咐我永遠不能離開我的弟弟。爸爸起初戀着繼母，我們弟兄倆個，早已忘却是前妻的兒子。病中的悽凉歲月，他才對我媽的遺像懺悔，爸爸依舊是我們的爸爸。如今我背了他的遺言，我對爸爸是不肖子，對弟弟是無義的哥哥。複雜的思潮，和隆隆的鐵軌相奏，我終於哭了。我離開爸爸媽媽的墳墓，離開永遠不能離開的弟弟，而自已向着渺茫的前途奮鬭，但是汽笛在怒吼，牠努力向黑暗進攻，夜的漫幕在我們達到目的地之前，將展開美麗的前程；我將排着我弟弟的手，在你們墳墓之前贖罪。偶然抬頭，東方微微的露出社白色，美麗的前程就在目前，我再說一句這是我「新的開始「罷。</p>

<p>— 馥</p>
<p>她說，離婚的原因大半在乎女子　當然，這句話是男人所不敢說的</p>
<p>這是海倫黛蕙姬（ＨelenTwelvetrees）所說的。我可不敢這樣放肆，因爲我是個男子。（有人說你這樣膽小，就不是個男子，但是好多男子都不敢說的，難道都不是男子嗎？）海倫說：「現在好萊塢離婚這樣盛行，但是女人是這種流行性離婚病的最大原因。什麽道理呢？就是因爲女人和男人結婚的時候，太隨便不當回正經事了。」海倫的說話，大概係從她自已經騐上得來的因爲她曾經結過婚而離過婚；可是現在自從嫁給了弗蘭克伍德之後，她已經了解於快樂家庭的種必需條件了。她說：「一個女人要是自已没有凖備好去盡妻子的責任，面貿然地和人結婚了，那是她自尋苦吃，毫無樂趣可言。」以下係海倫黛蕙姬發表的一番議論：</p>
<p>「國家應書頒布法律，勒令女學校訂明家政爲必需科目，使個個女子要學習爲人妻子的道理，如同他們學習拚音，讀本，算術一樣。等到一個女人長成之後，她和人家訂爲夫婦亦應當如同選擇行業，簽訂合同一樣的誠意，或者還要誠意些。她應當能夠自已解决各種家室問題，如同她處置各種事業問題一樣。現在婚姻所以降爲兒戲的原因，就是因爲一般女子當他們踏進敎堂的時候，並没有凖備他們自已，如同他們凖備了去做書記等職務一樣。」</p>
<p>「我這樣責備女人們，我或者會被人駡爲女性的叛徒，但是我的話是正確的。現在的摩登女子都是閉着眼睛，毫無思索地走進婚姻之路。他們宣讀婚誓的時候自已就不當回事，或者心裏竟存了一個念頭：「結婚不好，我可以就離的。」現在的新娘已不能稱爲出嫁了，她不過是嘗滋味而已。最近我有一位女友。她結婚還不到兩年，最近她想和她的丈夫離婚了。她說「我本來就没有相信我們同居能有幾久」她並且要起訴要求瞻養費。我問她起訴有什麽理由呢。她說「我費了兩年的光隂。在這兩年之内，我儘可嫁給許多人，或者我已經發了財。那爲什麽我的丈夫不給一個代價呢？」這種女人，我就不和她多講了，因爲她不相信能長久同居，而居然和一個男人結婚，並且想在男人身上發些財，而和他離婚，根本就談不上婚姻二字也。我說的那個女子，到現在還没有進法庭正式聲請離婚，但是有一位朋友告訴我，也的聲請離婚，可以說是毫無理由。要是遇見有道理法官，决不會判給她一個大錢的瞻養費的。」（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c278">評「豐年」　　GoldenHarvest <a href="#c278" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e278" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">278</a></h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>派拉蒙出品。大光明開映</p>
<p>在藍鷹的旗幟之下，美國當局是瘋狂的實行所謂復興運動。我們在報紙上可以知道羅斯福總統的指令企圖全國都爲這一運動而動員，於是在電影部門中也跟着反映出來，自是必然的事實。</p>
<p>說得非常明白的，這是一部以復興農村爲主題的影片。而且是十分强調的在銀幕上提出了一個嚴重的社會問題。說到這裏，不能不使我們爲之驚異。我們在美國片中，非常普遍的看到那種如醉似狂的「Ｌoveyou」的影片，現在却看到也漸漸注意到社會了。而且是以主要的社會問題作爲電影的題材，這自然是一種進步的現象。固然我們也看到好些意識的反映政治形式的影片，如「酒與女人等等。然而那種爲現行政策而吹嘘的態度，也表現得至爲明顯。假使要舉例的話，那末「白宫風雲」便是最好的實證。</p>
<p>再說，派拉輩是效忠羅斯福最努力的電影公司。當光陸大戲院還没有休業的時候，我們就看着好些十分努力的影片，在「鷹歌」等片之外還有「羅斯福奮鬥史」。現在又有了這「豐年」，再保持着一貫的態度。</p>
<p>爲了内容的檢討，不能不簡單的叙述故事。</p>
<p>一個農民生了兩個兒子，幼子在家耕田，長子在芝加哥做投機生意。長子用盡方法，操縱市場，小麥價格因之大跌，結果影響農村破産。因此，農民陷於困境而罷工，次子便是組織農民的領袖。及後，長子因兄弟的利害開係，而存心恢復小麥市場的價格。最後長子因小麥開禁而破産，回到鄕間去。</p>
<p>如故事中所述，作者根肯定的說明農村所以破産，乃是由於小麥的市價低落，而市價低落的原因，便是投機商人的操縱。當然，我們並不否認這裏所指明的頗有正確之處。在生産合理化的美國農村，其所以崩潰的，「榖賤傷農，」未嘗不是直接的原因。可是小麥爲什麽會跌便的呢？自然投機商人的操縱市場，是其原因之一，然而就整個的方面說，我們却不能忽視全世界的經濟恐慌。由於經濟組織的矛盾，一方面生産過剩，另一方面購買力減低，目前的世界風雲緊急，擴張軍備，準備着殖民地市場的再分割。這樣尖銳化的表現，還不足以說明農村破産的眞實原因嗎？關於這一點當然不是幾句話可以說得明白的，給經濟學家可以做一篇很長的文章。</p>
<p>如上所述，「豐年」的作者僅僅說明交易所的操縱是不夠的。同時，復興農村，也不是如此簡單的，卽使投機商人不壟斷市場，也不能使整個的小麥價格提高起來，這不過是極無希望的幻想，何况投機商人也不會離開自身的利益而天良發現的使農村復興，不管作者是如何苦口婆心的說商人和農民應當是兄弟一般。至於作者以說敎的口吻敎來自鄕間的商人們回到農村中去，更覺可笑。簡直是不能自圓其說。</p>
<p>前面說過，美國作者是愼重的注意到社會問題了。姑勿論他們對於這些問題，决不能尋求根本的解决，可是將電影接觸到眞實的社會現象，却是非常可喜的。因爲作者很愼重的處理這種題村，所以我關於内容方面，也就多寫了一些。現在再轉到演出方面。那末作者ＲalphMurrhy十分莊重的態度，乃是這一作品的特點。他以農村問題爲作品的重心，爲了一般的美國片之作風，也寫到一些不重要的愛情，這對於觀衆的提高興趣，乃是相當有效的。此外，再找出幾點來說明導演的聰明。</p>
<p>一、爲了維持社會的秩序，不直接描寫農民罷工或騷亂的場面，只間接的以報章或電報範軍帶過。</p>
<p>二、開場時，對於鄕村的素描，以Ｄisosve的方法處理得很好。特别是耕種的畫面，以說明農村的生産合理化，這是和中國農村完全不同的。</p>
<p>三、大兒子乘飛機到鄕間，許多牛馬牲口都驚駭而奔馳，再加上那老農民的驚異的顔面。</p>
<p>四、杯盤狼藉時的再會聲，利用聲片的特點。</p>
<p>五、交易所中的兩次高潮，都處理得當。　　六、老農民結婚時，牧師敎新婦和新郎接吻，在我們的猜想中，一定是怪難爲情的，而導演却使她十分勇敢，出乎人們預料之外的引人發笑。</p>
<p>七、角力時的畫面很美，也說到這兄弟二人不相上下。</p>
<p>以上所指出的是本片的精采處。一般的說，導演是富於創造力的。至於演員方面，却不須如何費力，李却亞倫似乎比以前的作品都要適合一些，要他擔當粗壯的角色，到底是比較好的。飾長子的卡斯特摩理斯（ＣhesterMorris）有幾場演得很好，如造謡說下雨披着雨衣跑到交易所的時候，以及破産的時候。老農民夫婦以在門口偷聽别人談話時爲最好。此外那兩個媳婦，因角色不重要不見有特殊可取之處。</p>

<p>齊格飛是發掘美的女性型的「哥倫布」，他有着銳利的眼睛，窺探到女性的内心深處，在過去的電影史上，有過甚大的貢獻，特别是在聲音搬上了銀幕之後，更長足的發展他的天才，把多少歌舞的女性造成了明星的地位。當他死訊發表的時候，大家以爲齊格飛班的靈魂没落了，齊格飛的聲譽低减了，但，新興的巨匠第薛爾代踏上他未曾走盡的前程，繼續他非凡的努力；擎起他的紅熱的火把，做一個前進的領導者。</p>

<p>他發表他的談話說：過去的歌舞片中的一羣舞女，不過是做做凑熱閙的夥兒，現在歌舞片又重新抬頭了，光景是完全不同，每一個舞女要有健全的體格，個性，和豐富的天才，並不是唱唱歌跳跳舞就算了，要造成每個舞女有做戲的充分機會，盡量的發揮她們的本能。在奸萊塢正有無量數未曾發掘出來的無名明星，這種新形色的歌舞片，將予每個無名英雄（雌）一個成名的機會。</p>

<p>(Nanjing) It is widely rumored in Fujian that defenses have been set up in Xianxia, Yandang, and other places on the border between Fujian and Zhejiang, and that considerable precautions have also been taken on the border between Fujian and Jiangxi. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of the Navy considers the maritime defense and security of the coastal areas bordering Fujian Province to be of utmost importance. It telegraphed Chen Jiliang, commander of the First Fleet stationed in Shanghai, to fly to Nanjing for personal instructions. Chen has now returned to Shanghai and is scheduled to depart by ship today to patrol the Min River and lead his fleet to respond as needed. As for Wang Shouting, commander of the torpedo fleet, who was previously ordered to lead his fleet to Xiangshan, Zhejiang, for maneuvers, he has completed the maneuvers and will arrive in Nanjing on the 23rd aboard the Chu Tai warship. Zeng Yiding, commander of the training fleet in Nanjing, will, upon Wang's arrival, jointly pay a visit to Navy Minister Chen to discuss maritime security issues and seek instructions. Once decisions are made, they will separately lead their fleets to patrol key ports and strategic locations under their respective jurisdictions. Yesterday's rumor that the Chu Qian warship was detained in Fujian is considered inaccurate by naval circles. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e4">Zhejiang Provincial Government Issues Circular Telegram Regarding the Current Situation <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(Hangzhou) Today, the Zhejiang Provincial Government issued a circular telegram regarding the current situation: (1) To the Central Executive Committee of the Nanjing Kuomintang: We have received your telegram. Since the outbreak of the national crisis, the Central Government has adhered to the spirit of peace and unity, dedicating itself to strengthening national power and revitalizing the nation. Any plan that is beneficial to resisting aggression and saving the country has been pursued with utmost dedication. The people of the entire country, aware of the precariousness of national affairs and the responsibility for national survival, have also been striving to improve themselves and move forward together, hoping to overcome difficulties and secure our nation. However, at a time when the military campaign against the communists is achieving successive victories and economic reconstruction is about to begin, Chen Mingshu and others have suddenly gathered their followers to instigate rebellion in Fujian, betraying the Party and the nation, destroying discipline, and establishing a system that is strange and absurd, and impossible to understand. They have even allied with the communist bandits, not hesitating to fuel their flames. Their absurd measures seem to be designed to shrink our territory and deliberately engage in separatism to harm themselves, to deepen the suffering of the people and plunge them into an abyss of despair, and to prevent the country's great plan for national salvation and survival from having an opportunity for calm arrangement, hastily stirring up turmoil to create obstacles. In a leaky boat in the midst of wind and rain, such acts of reversal are the most painful thing imaginable. Our country has faced continuous calamities, reaching their peak in recent years. However, the understanding of the people of the whole country regarding the future of the nation has deepened through the national crisis, and the will of the whole country to safeguard national survival is becoming stronger and cannot be taken away. The rebellious elements, with their deceptive and fickle actions, have greatly defied the will of the people, and their defeat will not require divination. The Central Government, in stabilizing the foundation of the country and protecting the people's livelihood with its moral authority, will surely suppress the rebellious plot in its infancy and quell the turmoil in an instant. I, Lu Diping, holding an important position and serving the country, am deeply aware of the difficulties of national affairs and am even more mindful of the importance of my responsibilities. I will strive to exhaust my limited abilities and be even more loyal, pacifying the people and strictly maintaining order. All that is done to assist the Party and the nation in eliminating disasters and turmoil will be based on the Central Government's orders, and I will spare no effort, daring not to refuse to go through fire and water. I respectfully submit this telegram, hoping for your consideration. Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, Lu Diping, etc. (stamped). (2) To the Party branches and governments of all provinces and cities: (Omitted above) I believe that with national affairs in such a difficult and dangerous state, there is no way to survive without unification, and we must first secure the interior before we can resist external aggression. Only by distinguishing between right and wrong, obedience and rebellion, can we avoid national and ethnic disasters. At this critical moment, how can we allow a few ambitious individuals to gamble with the foundation of the nation and hinder the great plan for national salvation? You are all loyal and devoted to the country, compassionate to the people, and detest evil and reject heresy. You will surely share this indignation. We hope that you will promote righteousness and suppress evil influences, so that justice will shine like the sun and the stars, and the wicked will extinguish themselves like fireflies. I respectfully submit this, hoping for your consideration. Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, Lu Diping, committee members Zhou Boyan, Lü Bichou, Wang Zhengying, Chen Bulei, Yang Mianzhong, Jiang Xihou, Jiang Bocheng, and Zeng Yangfu. (Stamped).

<p>(Nanjing) A certain member of the Central Committee stated that after the outbreak of the Fujian rebellion, in addition to the State Council and the Military Affairs Commission ordering all provincial governments to take strict precautions, the military and administrative subsidies issued to Fujian Province have also been suspended starting this month.

<p>(Nanjing) According to a certain military agency, Liu Heding's troops stationed in northern Fujian are well aware of Chen Mingshu's and others' plans. He sends secret reports to Dai Qi daily and sends separate telegrams to a certain agency of the Central Government. Therefore, his preparations are quite thorough. Furthermore, in order to prevent the expansion of the rebellion, the Central Government has ordered the troops stationed on the border between Zhejiang and Fujian to strictly prevent any attempts to invade Zhejiang. Huang, director of Liu Heding's office in Nanjing, said that the Fujian rebellion is being led by a small number of people. Although he has repeatedly received telegrams from the division headquarters about the inside situation, they are not very detailed. His army is a Central Army and will never rebel, obeying the orders of the Central Government and willing to make any sacrifices. Currently, his army is stationed in the northern and western parts of Fujian, awaiting orders from the Central Government. Currently, the troops stationed in Fujian Province include the 56th Division and the Independent 4th Brigade of the 19th Route Army, as well as his division. The 19th Route Army has a total strength of approximately 50,000 men. He plans to go to the Military Affairs Commission and the Ministry of War in the next few days to report his division's attitude and request instructions on future plans. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) According to naval sources, after the outbreak of the Fujian rebellion, the Central Government's agencies in Fujian were forcibly taken over. The Ministry of the Navy, upon receiving the report, immediately reported to President Wang and sent urgent telegrams to the naval agencies stationed in Fujian, urging them not to comply and to seize the opportunity to respond. However, the naval agencies stationed in Fujian had limited strength, and the disparity in numbers was too great. As a result, they were all forcibly occupied by armed force. At that time, Wang Mengbin, commander of the Mawei naval port, led his subordinates in fierce resistance. Later, under the cover of artillery and aircraft from the other side, Wang seized the opportunity to escape and came to Nanjing on the Hai Ning gunboat. He is expected to arrive in Nanjing around the 23rd. Jiang Yan, brigade commander of the 166th Brigade stationed in Fujian, arrived in Nanjing on the 22nd and is staying at the Anle Hotel. According to those around him, Brigade Commander Jiang has recently resigned from his post, and his arrival is purely a personal matter and has nothing to do with the current situation. Due to his position, he is unwilling to express any opinions on the Fujian affair to avoid causing misunderstandings. It is not yet decided whether he will go to Jiangxi. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) After the Fujian incident occurred, the Beijing, Fuzhou and Xiamen branches of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications all received orders from their head offices to temporarily suspend accepting remittances.

<p>(Hong Kong) The Executive Department sent a telegram to party branches at home and abroad on the 22nd, stating that Chen Mingshu, Li Jishen, and Xu Qian held a meeting in Fujian on the 20th, declaring their secession from the Kuomintang, abolishing the Blue Sky White Sun flag, forming a worker-peasant government, aligning externally with Japan, and cooperating internally with the Communist Party, burying the glorious history of the 19th Route Army, betraying the Party and the country, inviting foreign powers, spreading the Red peril, and causing endless harm. From the standpoint of the Three Principles of the People and the national masses, we will never agree or support them. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Xiao Focheng said that the Political Council passed a telegram on the 22nd advising the Fujian side, which was immediately sent. Li Bai had sent a telegram to Guangdong after the Fujian rebellion, and Li decided to return to Guangdong within a few days. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Political Council sent Liu Luyin to Hong Kong on the 21st to seek Hu Hanmin's opinion. He is expected to return to the province on the 22nd to report to the Political Council in the afternoon, so that a decision can be made on the attitude towards Fujian and a circular telegram can be issued. Guizhou and Guangxi are not expected to approve of the Fujian affair. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) After the key figures in Guangdong Province announced their attitude towards the Fujian rebellion, they gathered this afternoon to discuss contingency plans. They have now sent personnel to Hong Kong to contact Hu Hanmin. Zou Lu stated that the Guangdong authorities will strive to adhere to their original position of neutrality. However, they cannot express sympathy for the rebellion aimed at establishing a worker-peasant government. It is regrettable that Li Jishen and Chen Mingshu have now defected from the Party. (22nd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) Hu Hanmin's secretary, Wang Yangchong, said that he had only seen reports of the Fujian rebellion in the newspapers. Mr. Hu had not participated in it at all, and he had not heard of the rumor that he would enter Fujian. The extent of its changes varies from person to person, and the reports also differ greatly, so he does not know what kind of changes it is. Until the actual situation of the Fujian mutation is clear, he has no opinion to tell you. As for whether the Southwest will participate as a whole, it is a factual question and will be carefully observed. He has not heard the details of the situation in Fujian and does not want to comment much. Xiao Focheng also said that after news of the Fujian rebellion came out, the foreign media paid the most attention to Guangdong Province's attitude, because Guangdong Province is now the center of the Southwest and the birthplace of the Chinese Revolution. It is natural that it will attract social attention. However, the attitude of Guangdong Province towards Fujian is actually the easiest to know, because the claims of Guangdong Province are also the claims of the Southwest. They have long been revealed to the world, namely resisting Japan, suppressing the communists, and vigorously implementing the construction of the Three Principles of the People. The comrades in the Southwest are all united in their hearts and minds, striving to implement this claim and never willing to change it in the slightest. If Fujian's claims coincide with Guangdong's claims, we will express our sympathy. As for Guangxi Province, it is absolutely consistent with Guangdong. Understanding Guangdong's attitude is understanding Guangxi's attitude. Secondly, regarding Mr. Hu Zhantang's attitude, this side sent Liu Luyin to Hong Kong yesterday to pay his respects. He has now returned to the province. The rumors that Mr. Hu will enter Beijing or Fujian are not true. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A reporter from a certain news agency interviewed a certain member of the Central Committee who was familiar with the situation in Fujian. According to him, Chen Mingshu and others are carrying out their betrayal of the Party and the nation at a time when the country and the nation are on the verge of peril. No matter how appealing their slogans are, they will surely be abandoned by the people of the whole country. Moreover, Fujian's finances are in dire straits. Since the 19th Route Army was transferred to the defense, it has been two years. The so-called politicians have tried hard to reorganize it, but both the military and administrative expenses of Fujian Province are tight. Fan Qiwu felt overwhelmed and resigned, and Xu Xiqing also became passive due to difficulties. Looking at Guangdong's bankrupt finances, even with the implementation of the three-year plan, it cannot save it. The establishment of an emergency meeting will make it possible. Now, maintaining the status quo in Fujian's finances is still not enough. Guangxi is working hard to govern and will not easily make false promises. Even if Fujian's new organization can participate in Guangxi, Guangdong's three-year plan has officially begun, and various construction projects are gradually taking shape. Chen Jitang's attitude is calm, and politicians cannot sensationalize him in the future, so he will not follow the Fujian rebellion in the future. Jiangxi Province has heavy Central troops, so it is not easy to incite them. The poor areas of Yunnan and Guizhou are unable to care for themselves. The Fujian situation will soon collapse. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) Tonight, the Southwest Executive Committee of the Kuomintang issued a circular telegram, announcing that the Southwest government will not participate in the Fujian rebellion, and said that the Fujian affair is only a rebellion that is pro-Japanese externally and allied with the Communists internally. The Southwest adheres to the Three Principles of the People and will never allow self-division. (22nd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) Xiao Focheng told people here today that the new government of Fujian Province is no different from the puppet Manchukuo government. The Blue Sky White Sun flag was personally designated by Sun Yat-sen, and now it has been abolished, which is an open act of rebellion. He is a Fujianese and knows that communism is not suitable for Fujian Province. The 20 million people of the province will surely rise up to oppose the radical land policy. Guangzhou is not prepared to participate in the Fujian rebellion. The reply to the leaders of the Fujian rebellion has now been drafted and may be issued tonight or tomorrow.

Regarding military affairs, according to Chinese sources, the 19th Route Army is now gradually approaching the Guangdong border, and the defenses of northern and eastern Guangdong have been greatly strengthened. The Fourth Independent Division is continuing to advance towards eastern Guangdong Province. (22nd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) Chen Jitang issued a message to the people of Guangdong Province tonight, advising the public to remain calm and not to easily believe the rumors of the Fujian rebellion, and to cooperate with the provincial government to end the run on the banks. The Guangdong army's campaign against the communists in Fujian will not be affected by the province's secession. Guangdong Province is absolutely secure and there is no need to worry. This message can be seen as Guangdong Province's preparation to deal with all incidents, and the Guangdong Province's defenses are solid and reliable. (22nd Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>In the past, the brewing of political changes always began with verbal battles. After the exchange of letters and telegrams, they would then move to mediation. After a certain period of mediation, it would then begin to erupt. Today's Fujian rebellion, however, arose suddenly. Even if one wanted to mediate, it was too late. In the past, the launch of political changes was often limited to individuals and temporary issues of power. No matter how ambitious the warlords were, they still had to rely on the Three Principles of the People and never dared to abandon the Kuomintang's banner to establish their own. Today's Fujian rebellion, however, is using the slogan of withdrawing from the Kuomintang and establishing an all-people production government. Therefore, this change is of great significance. Several days ago, our port had already heard of this kind of rumor, but because we had not received reliable reports from Fujian, we did not dare to believe it deeply. Now, after reading the so-called Declaration of the Rights of the People of the People's Provisional Representative Assembly, its claims are relatively clear. The Central Government is the Central Government of the Kuomintang. From the perspective of the ruling party, this act of betraying the Party alone should already cause great anger and be severely punished without any hesitation. If the Fujian side still intends to proceed and has no intention of reining in at the brink of the precipice, then once the order to suppress the rebellion is implemented, another military disaster will inevitably arise. Here, we will temporarily set aside the goals and methods of this Fujian uprising and discuss the current situation of our country. We can no longer take any actions. Our country has suffered repeated disasters and successive wars in recent years. Moreover, banditry is rampant, rural areas are bankrupt, production is declining day by day, the unemployed population is increasing day by day, and the social economy is becoming increasingly unstable. The national situation has reached an extremely dangerous point. Moreover, it is exacerbated by the pressure of foreign aggression. Since the September 18th Incident last year, the people of the country have been calling for national salvation and resistance to foreign aggression every day, but the foreign aggression cannot be resisted and remains the same. Other issues, such as the autonomy of Inner Mongolia and the disturbances in Xinjiang, also have an impact on foreign affairs. As for the international situation, it has become increasingly tense recently. If another world war breaks out, and our country is involved, how can we protect ourselves? In this extremely dangerous situation, we can only hope that all parties will put aside their private opinions, abandon their concepts of power, and strive for unity, internally to reorganize politics and recuperate the people in order to survive, and externally to devote ourselves to transportation and develop border areas in order to consolidate national defense. In this way, there may still be a glimmer of hope for resurrection. Otherwise, it is like a doctor randomly prescribing medicine to a patient, not knowing how weak the patient's body is, and rashly prescribing a strong purgative. Even if the doctor does not necessarily lack the intention to cure the patient, what if the patient cannot withstand the medicine?</p>
<p>How much sympathy can Fujian's actions today win? How much danger does it put the country in? How much impact will it have on diplomacy? It is very strange that the leaders would do this rashly without careful consideration.</p>

<p>(Nanchang) President Chiang issued a letter to all officers and soldiers of the 19th Route Army, which stated: According to reports, Chen Mingshu, Li Jishen, and their ilk have seized Fuzhou, falsely using the name of our 19th Route Army, colluding with reactionary elements of the Third Party and the Social Democratic Party, advocating alliance with the Communists, betraying the Chinese Kuomintang, resisting the National Government, organizing their so-called Production Party, a guise for the Communist Party, and their so-called People's Revolutionary Government, abandoning the Party and national flag of the Blue Sky with a White Sun, created by our Party Leader since the revolution, and raising a rebel flag with a blue top, a red bottom, and five yellow stars embedded in the middle. At this time of serious national crisis, when the whole country is working together to suppress the Communists, they actually have this act of harming the Party and the country, hastening their own destruction. What is their intention? It is truly difficult to understand. The reason why Chen Mingshu and his like dare to brazenly launch this revolt is that they have actually reached a compromise with the Communist bandits in Jiangxi and Fujian, establishing a secret agreement of non-aggression, agreeing to provide supplies to the bandits, and planning military assistance and mutual support. This is evidenced by the presence of Huang Qixiang, Zhang Bojun, Peng Zexiang, and others, who are running errands for the Communist Party representatives, and the wife of Peng Dehuai remaining in Fuzhou, as well as the abolition of the national flag and Party emblem, and the high-sounding advocacy of land policies and worker-peasant policies. The claim of alliance with the Communists and betrayal of the Party is obvious. Furthermore, Chen Youren, who personally visited Shidehara the year before last to seek foreign assistance to occupy the Northeast, and Han Binli, who participated in the Nishihara Loan during the Anfu era, either hold new positions in the false government or act as envoys traveling east. Rumors abound, and the so-called conspiracy to sell out the country and harm the Party is credible. It is said that Chen and others are using the following as a pretext to spread their propaganda: on the one hand, they are threatening the officers and soldiers of our 19th Route Army, saying that if they do not ally with the Communist bandits in Fujian, they will be annihilated by the Communist bandits; on the other hand, they are deceiving the public with worker-peasant policies, implementing land revolution as a means of inciting them; and on the other hand, they are following the old trick of Fang Zhenwu and Ji Hongchang in North China, having already surrendered to Japan and colluded with the bandits, and then touting national salvation and resistance against Japan to deceive the officers and soldiers of our 19th Route Army. These traitors only use alliance with the Communists and collusion with Japan as a means, and destroying the Party and betraying the country as their goal. They have no regard for the glorious history of our 19th Route Army, and they do not care about the current fortunes and successes or failures of our 19th Route Army. The result will be that all the officers and soldiers of our 19th Route Army will be sacrificed and disgraced, which will not harm them in the slightest. Is this not a tragedy? Now, if we listen to the deception and manipulation of one or two people, and allow the entire Fujian to be lost to the Communist bandits, and are not allowed to sever ties with the Party and the country, and are scolded by both domestic and foreign observers, I fear that if the martyrs of our 19th Route Army, who sacrificed themselves for the suppression of the Communists and resistance against Japan, were to know, they would surely weep bitterly in the afterlife. Alas, my loyal and courageous officers and soldiers of the 19th Route Army! You once gained a good reputation for suppressing the Communists, resisting Japan, and not participating in internal wars. Now, you are being held hostage by the rebel Chen, and have become the ringleaders in destroying the Party and the country. What will you say to defend yourselves before the people of the country? How will you face the spirit of the Party Leader in heaven? How will you meet the martyrs who suppressed the Communists and resisted Japan in the afterlife? Should it not be the case that you, the officers and soldiers of my 19th Route Army, have followed me, Zhongzheng, in expeditions east and battles north, sharing life and death and hardships for more than a hundred battles since the thirteenth year of the Republic? You have established great achievements in the revolutionary process, and your heroic deeds are recorded in history. You are truly a loyal, courageous, and fighting army of the Party and the country. How can you be the private property of Chen Mingshu and his ilk? At this time of crisis and shock, you must be able to stand on your own with the spirit of loving the country and protecting the people, and you must not harm the public for private gain, or allow yourselves to be sacrificed for any individual's rebellion against the Party and the country. In particular, you should not blindly follow and echo the changes of heart of one or two people, and allow the merits and glory you have earned in the past, risking life and limb, to be destroyed. My loyal and courageous officers and soldiers, you understand the greater good and must have weighed things carefully. There is no need for further words. At this moment, the central authorities recognize that the only urgent task and the only way out for the country is to strive to suppress the Red bandits, which is the only way to defend the Party and the country and save it from danger. In recent days, the military operations to suppress the bandits in Jiangxi have made rapid progress. I, Zhongzheng, continue to order our bandit suppression forces to focus on completing the work of bandit suppression. I will never allow the Fujian Incident to affect the military operations of bandit suppression, nor will I allow the troops who have shared hardships for ten years to be deceived by one or two unscrupulous people, causing our national revolution to kill each other, leading to the shaking of the bandit suppression front, and fulfilling the Communist bandits' pre-determined plot to instigate the Fujian Incident in order to shatter our five encirclement and suppression plans, and also giving our enemies a chance to laugh at us. As for the ringleaders of the Fujian Incident, we will observe their future actions and give them a chance to become aware and reform themselves. I hope that the officers and soldiers of my 19th Route Army will all understand this intention, on the one hand, maintaining your original bandit suppression line and not being swayed by disordered orders, and on the other hand, striving to clarify justice and promote repentance from the rebellion. Selfless devotion to righteousness has clear historical precedent, and rectifying chaos and returning to the right is an unshrinkable duty. Saving the country and saving yourselves, the key lies here. I hope that my officers and soldiers will quickly consider this and act accordingly. I have high hopes for you.

<p>(Nanjing) Wu Zhihui came to Nanjing from Wuxi to attend various central meetings, wearing a black cotton vest and an ochre cotton robe. When the Central Political Council meeting adjourned, he said of the Fujian incident: "I have already sent a telegram to Mr. Hu. This kind of rebellious action is simply unjustifiable. We should not pay too much attention to them. This is the same as Zhang Xun's restoration. Just watch for a few days, and it will naturally disappear." (Special telegram, 22nd)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the Fujian Incident, the Foreign Ministry spokesperson made the following statement to visiting reporters: The spokesperson first stated that the illegal elements such as Chen Mingshu organized a false government in Fujian to resist the central government and concluded a military agreement with the Communist bandits, which has attracted the attention of people at home and abroad and caused deep dissatisfaction. However, the rebellion in Fujian is only controlled by a few people, and other provinces will not follow suit. Guangdong is particularly disgusted with the rebels in Fujian and will assist the central government in jointly suppressing the rebel party. The central committee members remaining in the Southwest, because the rebels claimed to oppose the party, will take a consistent attitude with the central government. This will further promote the sincere unity within the country and jointly save the country from danger. The spokesperson continued that the central government will severely deal with the Fujian Incident and will properly protect the lives and property of foreigners.

<p>(Nanjing) Chen Jitang's representative in Nanjing, Yang Dezhao, arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 22nd. According to him, he returned to Guangdong this time and met with Mr. Chen Bonan. Regarding the Fujian incident, he still holds a wait-and-see attitude. Guangdong is currently working hard on suppressing bandits and is actively carrying out a three-year plan. If Fujian shows a thorough change of heart toward Guangdong, Guangdong will have to take precautions for the sake of its own safety. At the same time, it will follow the central government's instructions and take consistent action. Since the Fujian incident occurred, the central committee members in the Southwest have had very harmonious relations with the provincial government. Hu is still in Hong Kong. Hu is a veteran of the Party and the country and a pioneer of our Party, and he has always attached great importance to the history of the Party. Fujian's acceptance of the Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party to participate in the organization of the so-called People's Government is tantamount to betraying the Party and selling out the country. Hu hates evil like poison and will never be used by such behavior. Therefore, Hu is currently in Hong Kong and has no intention of entering Fujian, nor does he want to enter Fujian, so as not to tarnish his past reputation. The rumor that the two army commanders, Xiang Hanping and Yu Hanmou, were detained for being discovered by Chairman Chen's conspiracy to collude with Fujian is a castle in the air. Xiang and Yu have been comrades of Chairman Chen for many years, sharing hardships together, and will never resort to such a tactic. Xiang resigned voluntarily and is currently recuperating. Yu is especially relied upon by Chairman Chen and is currently in Guangdong participating in military affairs, jointly planning to deal with the current situation. The detention is probably a misunderstanding of the rumors. With Fujian in this isolated and helpless position, it may be pacified soon. I plan to visit Wang immediately to present the recent military and political situation in Guangdong. Within two or three days, I also plan to go to Jiangxi to meet Chiang and ask for instructions on the situation. In short, at this time of serious national crisis, the Guangdong authorities are extremely willing to avoid war. However, Fujian is now in a hurry, and it is not yet certain whether it can turn hostility into harmony. However, Guangdong's actions are all based on the central government's principles and will never act rashly. (Special telegram, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Yang Dezhao, Chen's representative in Guangdong, arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai on the 22nd to meet with key figures of the central government and report on the military and political situation in Guangdong.

<p>(Beiping) After the Inner Mongolia autonomy issue plan was decided, Huang Zhao is discussing all the implementation details between the provincial and county governments and the autonomous region government with the Suiyuan provincial authorities. It is prepared to hold a Mongolian-Han joint celebration in Guihua City at the end of this month. The provincial government is now actively preparing and has decided to expand the organization. The provincial government has separately invited the Mongolian princes and officials of all leagues and banners and the local agencies, groups, and people of Chahar and Suiyuan to participate, and plans to set up entertainment to help. The Mongolian princes will send representatives to participate. Many from the Tumote Independent Banner will participate. (Special telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>Guihua Wang replied to Huang Zhao by telegram on the 22nd, saying that the Baolingu Temple's method of solving the Mongolian issue is in line with the central government's principles and can be discussed with Fu. Huang has exchanged opinions with Fu for several days. Qin Decun met with Huang Zhao, Fu, and others on the evening of the 21st and discussed for a long time, and explained in detail the situation of the Mongolian banners in Chahar Province.

<p>(Beiping) Qian Dajun arrived in Ping tonight and conveyed Chiang's telegram to He Yingqin. A general agency is set up above the one or two autonomous regions of Inner Mongolia, which is a joint conference organized by representatives from all leagues and banners to promote autonomy. A garrison team or security team will be established in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, which will be decided by Xu Tingyao after asking the central government for instructions. Zoubu will set up a military quota between the one or two regions according to the terrain of the Mongolian banners. (Special telegram, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Xu Tingyao came to Ping this morning to talk. I went to Baolingu Temple with Huang Zhao before to inspect the Mongolian autonomy issue, which was largely resolved. Huang is now staying in Sui. It is scheduled to hold a Han-Mongolian celebration in Sui on the 25th of this month. After the conference closes, he will report to Jinjing. Huang spent a lot of effort to resolve the Mongolian issue this time. When he arrived at Baolingu Temple, he met with De Wang for the first time. De Wang presented a draft plan for the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government, requesting that all the original Mongolian lands be划歸within the scope of the autonomous region, and asked Huang to immediately agree to accept it. Huang did not allow it because the plan he drafted conflicted with the central government's decision-making principles and administrative system. Later, after frank meetings and several consultations, De Wang's attitude gradually softened and accepted the central government's principles, dividing the Chahar-Suiyuan Mongolian land into the first and second autonomous regions of the Mongolian side. The representatives of the leagues and banners also each felt satisfied. Huang funded 6,000 yuan to distribute travel expenses to return to their respective banners. (Special telegram, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The plans for the first and second district governments of the Mongolian Autonomous Region have been negotiated. Other Mongolian lands are prepared to be handled in the same way and are divided into seven districts in total.

<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the issues of traffic and postal communication and the establishment of customs, the Supervisory Yuan sent Shao Hongji, Liu Qing, Gao Lu, and Zeng Dao to see Director Wang. Wang contacted the four members of the Supervisory Committee by telephone on the 22nd to come to the official residence. Wang solemnly stated that the issues of traffic and postal communication and the establishment of customs are currently under detailed study by the government. The rumor that they will be realized soon is not true. Yoshioka Village's arrival in Ping was reported to be the beginning of negotiations on various issues. The central government sent a telegram to inquire about the two commissioners Huang and He in Beiping. According to the reply, Yoshioka Village's arrival in Ping was entirely for private friendship and entertainment. The reports are incorrect. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has now notified the embassies of various countries in Beijing, Shanghai, Pingjin, and other places to make it clear that the reports are all rumors. Director Wang finally told the members of the Supervisory Committee that the central government must study various issues, whether or not they are carried out, and will definitely proceed under the principle of not recognizing the puppet state and not losing sovereignty in the future. The members of the Supervisory Committee considered Wang's reply satisfactory. (Special telegram, 22nd)</p>
<h3 id="e24">Talk by Yang Xiaocang, Military Attache at the Embassy in Japan <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Yang Xiaocang, military attache at the embassy in Japan, returned to China. After visiting Chiang in Jiangxi, he came to Nanjing. According to him, recently the Soviet Russia proposed to Japan to conclude a non-aggression treaty. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs also agreed, but it was opposed by a part of the military, and it could not be concluded in the end. Afterwards, the situation between the two sides gradually deteriorated, but the Russian side still intends to find ways to ease it. Judging from the fact that the Russian government sold the Chinese Eastern Railway, which it had no right to sell this year, to Japan, its desire to ease the conflict between Japan and Russia is very obvious, but it has also failed to become a reality. Until now, the situation between the two sides has become tense, but according to my personal observation, it will not lead to a break. Modern warfare is not comparable to what it was ten years ago. If it does not start, then it is over. Once it breaks out, then green gas and poisonous gas will all appear on the battlefield, and huge constructions and most of humanity can be destroyed in an instant. Since the European War, the world's countries have not recovered their vitality, and countries have not failed to advocate peace, but the hearts of mutual suspicion have not diminished slightly. They verbally say to reduce armaments, but secretly they are actively enriching them. In short, current events are unexpected. Sometimes a country or two may cause a second world war due to trivial matters, which is unknown. Domestic political views in Japan are extremely diverse, but the power faction is more powerful. The people are all very patriotic. As for the economic situation, under the world's economic depression, the country is becoming more and more difficult, but whether the management is appropriate or not, it is because having money cannot be controlled, and it is better for those who have no money to have a calculation. Since the 918 Incident, many overseas Chinese in Japan have returned to China. In total, there are about several thousand overseas Chinese now, but they are all very poor and there are many unemployed. In the past, most of the overseas Chinese in Japan sold Japanese goods. After the 918 Incident, they all refused to sell Japanese goods, and their ambition is commendable. Therefore, the Japanese have also taken back self-operation and no longer rely on our overseas Chinese. Therefore, overseas Chinese are unemployed and extremely poor, and they should be provided with relief. I returned to China this time due to illness and will take a short-term rest. The date of return to office is undecided. (Special telegram, 22nd)</p>

<p>(Guangzhou) The Guangdong Provincial Economic Conference opened this morning. Chen Jitang deeply regretted the occurrence of the cash-out wave in his speech, and said that Guangzhou does not need to worry about the Fujian Incident, and the provincial defense is very solid.

<p>(Guangzhou) The ten-yuan banknotes issued by the Guangdong Provincial Bank have caused a cash-out wave. The authorities felt it difficult, so they announced today that the redemption of these banknotes will be suspended for one month. This cash-out wave was caused by the activities of speculators, who deliberately exaggerated the seriousness of the Fujian Incident in order to achieve their speculative goals. At the request of the Chamber of Commerce, the Department of Finance has announced that bank deposits are only allowed to be withdrawn by 20 percent. (Reuters telegram, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) Chen Jitang sent a letter to the Guangdong Provincial Government today, requesting that all kinds of exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous taxes in the province, more than 120 in total, be waived, because the most important task of the Guangdong Provincial Three-Year Plan is the reconstruction work, so all unreasonable burdens should be waived. (Reuters telegram, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) The authorities only allowed newspapers to publish news about the Fujian Incident today. Although the newspapers did not comment, they all seemed to advocate that the central government should suppress it. The cash-out wave still makes the authorities uneasy, but after the government implements strict plans, the situation should gradually stabilize. According to well-informed sources, the government may suspend the salaries of all civil servants in the province for one month in order to transfer this money to redeem banknotes.

<h3 id="e27">The United States and Russia End All Outstanding Issues. Russia Owes the United States 768.5 Million Yuan in Old Debts. The United States Compensates Russia 15 Million Yuan for Damage from Military Intervention. The New Agreement Can Be Established Today <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) It is heard that the United States and Russia will be able to establish a new agreement on Thursday, ending all previous entanglements and starting a new relationship. This agreement is currently being negotiated between Soviet Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov and officials from the US State Department and the Treasury Department. After it is compiled, it can completely resolve the old Russian debts to the US and the US overseas Chinese's requests for confiscated property, and the Soviet Russian requests for the military intervention in Archangel, etc. The Russian debt to the United States has been a major obstacle to the resumption of diplomatic relations for sixteen years, totaling about 768,500,000 yuan in principal and interest, of which the principal includes 86,000,000 yuan of public bonds issued by Imperial Russia in the United States, 187,000,000 yuan borrowed by the Kerensky government in the United States, 111,000,000 yuan of Imperial Russian war debts in the hands of Americans, and 60,500,000 yuan of property confiscated by Soviet Russia. The reason for Soviet Russia's refusal to pay is that it considers this public debt to have been used by the previous government to suppress the working class. The fettered people should not be held responsible for paying the value of the fetters, and the Communist Party had fully warned that it would not recognize this debt, and Germany denied previous debts after the revolution, citing the example of the US federal government refusing to repay 300 million yuan in debt. As for the Soviet Russia's request for compensation for damages from the Allied intervention in Siberia and northern Russia, it once requested 60,000,000,000 yuan, of which the United States should bear a certain amount, which has never been divided. Now, according to the exchange of documents, Soviet Russia has abandoned its claim for damages for the Siberian part, and only claims the Archangel part. The legal basis for this Soviet Russian claim is the previous American Alabama case, which made the British compensate 15 million yuan as a precedent. Currently, Litvinov and US Ambassador to Russia Bullitt, Undersecretary of State Ferry, Burr, and Acting Secretary of the Treasury Morganthau have been consulting for days to discuss solutions. Litvinov is scheduled to go to New York for a welcome banquet on Thursday afternoon and return home by boat on Saturday, but if necessary, it may be postponed to ensure that the negotiations in the United States are completely concluded before returning.

The Drafting Committee, after much work, attempted to reconcile the British draft disarmament treaty with the Italian and German revised proposals. Now, France insists that this Drafting Committee should continue its work, but Italy opposes this, believing that the Four-Power Pact is the best tool for finding a solution. France strongly disagrees, because Italy is clearly favoring Germany, and France suspects that Britain intends to make new concessions to Germany in order to entice Germany back to Geneva. Meanwhile, Italian newspapers are vigorously criticizing the League of Nations, calling it an appendage of the Treaty of Versailles and a group that only creates trouble and never finds solutions. It is expected that the important meeting of the Fascist Grand Council on December 5th will demand active revision of the League of Nations Covenant, especially advocating for complete separation from the Treaty of Versailles. As for Germany's attitude towards the Disarmament Conference, it seems to be that any direct negotiations are acceptable, but not in Geneva. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>

<p>(Geneva) It is heard tonight that France and Italy have failed to agree on the question of whether the Commission on the Control of Armaments should adjourn, and the plan for a two-month adjournment of the Disarmament Conference may be affected. It is reported that if a compromise cannot be found before tomorrow, the Steering Committee may not recommend adjournment. Currently, the French representative, Paul-Boncour, is striving to ensure that the Commission on the Control of Armaments continues to meet during the disarmament adjournment period; otherwise, the French representative will insist that the General Commission should still convene on December 4th as originally planned. The Italian representative, De Suàlogna, stated that without German participation, technical work would be futile and inappropriate, and that if the Commission on the Control of Armaments continues to meet, Italy will no longer participate. The British attitude is moderately in favor of the Italian position, while the United States seems largely indifferent. After a day of heated debate between the two sides, Chairman Henderson was authorized to recommend to the Steering Committee tomorrow that the question of whether the Commission on the Control of Armaments should adjourn be left to Henderson and others to decide. However, Paul-Boncour stated that he understands this to mean that the Commission on the Control of Armaments should continue to work, while the Italian representative stated that it should be understood as a suspension of work. Therefore, it is expected that the debate in tomorrow's Steering Committee meeting will be more intense than anything seen since the opening of the Disarmament Conference. (National Telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The disarmament talks have created a new crisis because of France's insistence that the Technical Committee should continue its work during the adjournment of the Disarmament Conference. French Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour insisted that work must continue, but representatives from Britain, Italy, and the United States did not agree. The Italian representative said that some problems might cause unexpected dangers. After four hours of discussion, today's meeting broke up without results. The issue will be discussed in tomorrow's Disarmament Conference Steering Committee meeting. It is understood that French representative Paul-Boncour intends to convene the General Commission if he cannot achieve his goal, as he considers this a matter of principle. (Reuters, 21st)</p>

<p>(Geneva) The Disarmament Steering Committee meeting this afternoon passed Chairman Henderson's proposal without discussion, namely, to postpone the General Commission, i.e., the plenary session, until after the League of Nations Executive Council meeting on January 15th next year. France and Italy had a last-minute dispute over the continued work of the Technical Committee, which was finally resolved by assigning the decision to the administrative staff. Therefore, the two committees involved will continue to meet for several days, while the British government intends to encourage diplomatic talks. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Disarmament Conference Steering Committee will hold a closed meeting this afternoon, at which Chairman Henderson will recommend that the Disarmament Conference General Commission be reconvened after the League of Nations Executive Council meeting on January 15th, and that countries should conduct diplomatic negotiations to reduce political differences. The Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Disarmament Conference, together with the Secretary, may decide the extent to which current business should continue to be handled. Henderson stated today that he is prepared to stay in Geneva for half a month, which suggests that France and Italy may have made mutual concessions regarding the continuation of business. However, representatives from some other countries advocate shortening the Christmas holiday. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>

<p>(London) This afternoon, Prime Minister MacDonald reported to the House of Commons on the progress of the Geneva disarmament talks, saying that Germany's withdrawal from the League of Nations and the Disarmament Conference has created a new situation. It is now necessary to consider the problems themselves and reach a compromise before the Disarmament Conference can continue. The Disarmament Conference has never retreated, and it has never been a question of advancing or retreating. What is doubtful now is only what is the best procedure at present. In recent days, Simon and Eden have held beneficial and moderate talks with Disarmament Conference Chairman Henderson and representatives from various countries. Simon returned to Beijing this morning. It is said that Geneva has a very good and firm spirit of cooperation, and does not want the disarmament work to end in failure or stagnation. Moreover, the general opinion is that diplomatic organs should make equal and supplementary efforts to contribute most powerfully to the work handled by the Disarmament Conference.</p>
<p>Simon's trip to Geneva was on behalf of the entire British Cabinet, so it can be said that the British government's joint efforts necessary for the final victory have been very laborious. We hope that Germany can join this kind of diplomatic exchange of views, and hope to continue its efforts so that the Disarmament Conference can achieve good results. As for the United Kingdom, it has always been tireless in this matter. We, of course, should still be in close contact with the United States on all events. The Prime Minister then quoted the proverb "Where there's a will, there's a way," saying that the British government does have the ambition to make disarmament a success. The Prime Minister continued,</p>
<p>There are many floating rumors about the work of the British so-called munitions factories, which is regrettable. It is important to know that the factories were busy in October, and more workers were hired, really because of water conservancy work. According to news from Sheffield, the orders received by major steel mills, of which those related to munitions, are less than 20%, and in this percentage, the propulsion engines used for warships currently under construction in the usual procedures still account for a large part. Sheffield factories currently have no foreign orders for munitions. The Prime Minister did not use numbers to prove that chemical and steel factories now almost entirely manufacture industrial products, and proved that in the first ten months, the export of nickel only increased by 100%, not 700%, and mostly exported to Germany, France, and Russia. Germany and France are for making nickel coins, and the use of Russia is unknown. (Reuters, 21st)</p>

<p>(Geneva) The so-called central group in the League of Nations Disarmament Conference Steering Committee decided today to recommend to the Steering Committee that when the committee convenes its meeting tomorrow, it should propose to extend the General Commission for two months. Therefore, according to its scheduled procedures, the General Commission will have to meet after the League of Nations Council meeting in January next year. Furthermore, the conciliation conference advocated by Britain and Italy in recent days, aimed at enabling the Disarmament Conference to achieve concrete results among the major powers, has not yet resulted in an agreement among the countries, and France has already stated first that if it participates in this negotiation, it must first be determined that all of France's allies should be invited, and the scope of discussion should be limited to matters that have already been agreed upon. Therefore, under these circumstances, the idea that the major powers want to convene a meeting outside of Geneva has now been temporarily shelved. (National Telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>(Paris) The German Ambassador Koster went to the French Foreign Ministry this morning to return the visit of the French Foreign Undersecretary Taisan, taking the opportunity to explain that in order to enhance the relationship between France and Germany, all attempts that damage the relationship should be abandoned, and an effort should be made to find out the source of information obtained by well-wishers. The ambassador also touched on the issue of German-Polish relations, and the fake article by the German Propaganda Minister published in the small Parisian newspaper did not follow the requests of other French newspapers to disclose the original manuscript photograph.

<p>(Geneva) The Disarmament Conference continuing to work, what was said yesterday that all parties had agreed to was only superficially so. In fact, representatives of the major countries argued for five hours about this matter. The only thing on which the views of all parties could truly agree was to continue diplomatic talks to reduce differences of opinion on political issues. The Italian representative, Suàlogna, strongly opposed the continued work of the various committees of the Disarmament Conference. The Italian representative also said that, in any case, Italy could only participate in the work in Geneva as an observer. The British representative's words were slightly different, but their intention was still to support the Italian representative, only advocating that the various embassies should continue to make contact, without requiring the various committees of the Disarmament Conference to continue working.

<p>Rössler and Disarmament Conference Chairman Henderson did not express definite views, so the only one who strongly advocated the importance of the work of the various committees of the Disarmament Conference was French Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour. American representative, Minister to Switzerland, Wilson, gave some assistance. Paul-Boncour made this claim for two reasons: (1) Issues such as the supervision and restriction of military quotas and military expenditures should ultimately be discussed anew. (2) Countless people in the world have great hopes for the Disarmament Conference and cannot order the conference to close completely. After Paul-Boncour spoke, it was suggested that, when the Presidium meets tomorrow, the chairmen, vice-chairmen, and rapporteurs of the various committees should be allowed to decide for themselves the extent to which they should continue to work. Paul-Boncour approved this proposal. The reason for his approval was that the disarmament work could still continue in Geneva, and the disarmament negotiations would still be in Geneva and would not be moved elsewhere, which is what Paul-Boncour focused on. When the meeting opens tomorrow, France's position will receive assistance from several representatives, especially the Polish representative. At that time, Paul-Boncour will openly declare that, logically, rationally, and intellectually, work must continue. This is not only in France's interest, but also for the benefit of the League of Nations. (Havas, 21st)</p>

<p>(Paris) Today, the French Chamber of Deputies held a public debate on financial issues, and the government is again in danger of collapse. At present, the Sarraut government is only supported by the Radical Party, so the government's future is very dark.

If it fails, he demands that the Chamber of Deputies be dissolved. Then, right-wing deputies Denne and Rice Daley spoke, criticizing the government's plan. Finance Minister Bonnet rose to defend it.

<p>Madrid Although the recent election in Spain has been won by the right-wing parties, the rumor that Spain will soon return to monarchy is obviously not yet possible. On the one hand, there are currently very few people among the right-wing parties who are inclined to the imperial system. Second, conservative figures such as Gil Robles, although they cannot forget the imperial system, do not want to change the state system at this time, causing great shock to the people. Furthermore, there will be a by-election on December 3rd, and the future organization of Congress, as well as the balance of power between the left, right, and center, the right-wing, although it has won a temporary victory, cannot have a full grasp of the future. On the left side, they are still continuing to rely on the strength of the government, trying to establish a so-called joint front of republican factions, including the Socialist Party, in order to stop the offensive of right-wing groups.

<p>A serious riot occurred in Budapest last night. More than a thousand legitimists gathered in the famous Lido Hotel in the center of the capital to celebrate the 25th birthday of the former Crown Prince Otto. Before the banquet began, a large group of members of the Anti-Habsburg Royalist Federation, mixed with hundreds of university students, surrounded the building, distributed leaflets, accusing the legitimists of being rebellious and violating Hungarian law. Then, the indoor banquet opened, and the crowd outside shouted "Down with Otto" and "Down with the Habsburgs." Whenever a famous guest arrived, the crowd sang the Hungarian national anthem. There were police at the scene at the time, trying their best to maintain order. Demonstrators tried to break into the building, so some threw bricks at the glass windows, or threw stink bombs into the room. The noise of the commotion was deafening. At the end of the banquet, when the guests went out, the protesters lurked in the side streets, throwing bricks at their cars, and some students tied grass into the shape of a person, dressed in evening clothes, in the likeness of Otto, and hung it on the telegraph pole on Maria Valerie Street. The protesters rioted until after midnight before being dispersed by the police. (National Telegram, 21st)</p>

<p>(Washington) Sprague, the Chief Advisor of the U.S. Treasury Department and one of the world's leading monetary experts, who once served as an advisor to the Bank of England, resigned from his post today due to disagreement with the U.S. government's monetary policy, stating that he will help create public opinion against Roosevelt's plan, believing that at present, there is no way to prevent the dangerous path of unlimited inflation except by arousing public opinion. Therefore, he is severing his relationship with the government. He also said that the current policy may completely bankrupt the government's credit, because the Treasury's expenditures far exceed its revenues. It is expected that between now and the end of the fiscal year, it will be necessary to borrow 200 million yuan to make up for the losses of the government's various new experiments. He also strongly attacked the gold purchase plan in his letter, saying that he believes that purchasing gold abroad cannot raise prices, because since the price decline in the current environment, it has not been able to promote the need for materials or labor. To raise world prices, there must be a situation sufficient to increase the need for labor and materials, and then production and services can be increased, and living standards can also be improved. Sprague also said that when the government is determined to depress the gold yuan, public debt becomes an unsatisfactory investment, especially government public debt, so most government public debt is currently below face value. He believes that if the President does not abandon the current monetary policy in the future, he will inevitably resort to issuing more banknotes to meet government expenditures.

<p>The Indian Parliament in New Delhi today approved the International Silver Agreement. The Finance Member of the Viceroy's Executive Council, Sir George Schuster, welcomed the agreement, regarding it as an achievement of international cooperation. He stated that a mere rise in the price of silver would not increase India's purchasing power. However, the situation is different for China, whose currency is based on silver. A high silver price increases China's purchasing power, but this is only temporary, as a high exchange rate only temporarily encourages imports. The Silver Agreement was signed in London at the close of the World Economic Conference by silver-using countries India, China, and Spain, and silver-producing countries Canada, Mexico, the United States, Australia, and Peru. This agreement restricts the Indian government from selling silver. Starting from January of next year, silver sales should not exceed 140 million ounces within four years, averaging 35 million ounces per year. If silver sales in any year are less than this amount, the remainder should be added to the amount to be sold in the following year, but no more than 50 million ounces can be sold in one year. The Indian government has the right to sell silver to countries willing to pay off American war debts with silver. If this agreement leads to India selling 175 million ounces of silver at any point during these four years, the agreement will be automatically terminated. China undertakes not to sell or destroy silver obtained from circulating currency during these four years. At the same time, Canada, the United States, Australia, Mexico, and Peru all undertake not to sell silver during these four years and to purchase or recover 35 million ounces of mined silver from the silver market each year. The distribution of this amount will be negotiated by the governments of the countries concerned. This agreement must be ratified by the governments of the countries concerned before April 1, 1934.

<p>A Beiping dispatch states that Shanhaiguan is scheduled to be received within days. Huang He sent Tao Shangming and Zhu Shiqin as representatives to Shanhaiguan along with Yin Shousong, the magistrate of Linyu County, to negotiate the receipt procedures. Tao and others went to Tianjin the night before to contact the Hebei Provincial Government and visit Nakamura, the commander of the Japanese Tianjin Garrison. It was decided that tomorrow night (22nd) they will go to Shanhaiguan. Chaishan, a military attache from the Japanese Embassy, will accompany them. It is expected that they will arrive in Shanhaiguan at 7:00 am on the 23rd, and after negotiating the receipt procedures with Endo, the staff officer of the 14th Mixed Brigade of the Japanese Army, and Ochiai, the commander of the Shanhaiguan garrison, the receipt will begin on the 25th and can be completed by the end of this month. The 14th Mixed Brigade of the Japanese Army, in addition to the original garrison, has mostly withdrawn to Jinzhou. Currently, only about two hundred troops remain stationed. After the defense is handed over, all troops can be fully withdrawn. Whether the organs of the puppet state and the local maintenance association will be completely abolished or moved outside the Guan are yet to be determined. According to the Japanese, the Japanese barracks outside the Guan can be completed within two months. The Japanese troops currently stationed at various passes of the Great Wall can be fully withdrawn two months later, and the receipt of the various passes can also be carried out successively. However, the puppet troops stationed at Malan Village, citing the protection of the mausoleum, have not yet withdrawn. After negotiations between our side and the Japanese side, they finally agreed to withdraw.</p>
<p>The establishment of customs at various passes is currently under investigation to ascertain the actual situation at each pass. Zhang Yongnian, the deputy commissioner of taxation, has returned from a survey of Gubeikou and will go to survey Xifengkou, Jieling, and Lengkou tomorrow. The puppet government has set up checkpoints at Shanhaiguan and Gubeikou to levy taxes. The locations of the customs are all inside the Guan. The establishment of customs at Xifengkou and Lengkou is also in preparation. Whether the puppet government's checkpoints can be moved outside the Guan in the future is still a problem. If our side establishes customs at the same location where the puppet government has already established customs in the future, disputes are inevitable, which is a real question. If it is located farther away, it will be easier to steal and evade duties for goods entering the Guan. Currently, most of the goods coming and going are groceries going out and contraband coming in. The Japanese have established long-distance bus companies at various key points, specializing in transporting these contraband items, so that our side cannot carry out inspections effectively. This is also a major problem in the future. Therefore, even if we establish customs, if the Japanese rely on strong power and do not accept inspections, all contraband items cannot be banned, and all goods cannot be effectively taxed, then each pass is tantamount to being established in vain.

The meeting adjourned at 12:00 p.m. In the afternoon, He issued another circular, ordering the Chairman of the Provincial Government, Yu Xuezhong, to rush back to Tianjin tomorrow night to make arrangements. Song Zheyuan, who was recuperating in Tianjin, was also summoned by telegram to come to Beiping around 11:00 p.m. tonight and will soon return to Chahar to take charge. The authorities have decided to send Jiang Bocheng and Huang Shaohong to Shandong and Shanxi, respectively, to visit Han Fuju and Yan Xishan for discussions. After receiving his orders, Jiang Bocheng will leave for Jinan from Beiping within the day to meet with Han Fuju, and if necessary, he may also visit Mount Tai.

<h3 id="e83">The Fujian Situation Tenses: Zhang Qun Summoned to Nanjing to Discuss Major Plans to Address the Situation; Zhang Expresses Opinions on the Fujian Incident <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: The independence of Li Jishen, Chen Mingshu, and others in Fujian has changed from rumors to reality. In order to deal with this serious situation, Premier of the Executive Yuan Wang Jingwei telegraphed Zhang Qun, member of the Central Committee and Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Government, on the 21st, summoning him to Nanjing to discuss major plans. On the same day, former Director of the Aviation Administration Huang Bingheng arrived in Hankou from Nanjing to visit Zhang. That evening at 9:00 p.m., they boarded the Taikoo Company's Wusong Wheel eastward. Due to the hasty departure, Zhang was accompanied only by his secretary, Feng Fei. Provincial government affairs were temporarily entrusted to Lu Zhu, member of the Provincial Committee and Secretary-General, to handle on his behalf. Before his departure, Zhang made a statement to reporters, saying, "The unusual situation in Fujian, I do not yet know the truth. I have just received a telegram from Premier Wang, asking me to discuss major plans to deal with the Fujian situation, so I am leaving immediately. I will be able to get detailed information after arriving in Nanjing. At this time of domestic and foreign troubles, the whole country should unite sincerely, consolidate the central government, and save the country from danger. How can there be further division? Today's events are truly heartbreaking. After completing my official business in Nanjing, I will go to Shanghai and then return to Nanchang to visit Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. I can return to Hubei in about two weeks. This visit to Chiang Kai-shek will be to report on two matters: (1) the resettlement of migrants in the recovered bandit areas of the Henan-Hubei-Anhui border region; (2) the joint issuance of silver dollar notes by the Hubei Provincial Bank and the Four Provinces Farmers Bank. Regarding the resettlement issue, when Commander-in-Chief Liu Zhenhua passed through Hankou a few days ago, he discussed it in detail with me, Director He, and Chief of Staff Cao. Commander-in-Chief Liu advocated that the people in the bandit areas should be completely moved out and arrangements should be made for their resettlement, with the expenses borne by the Provincial Government. The expenses for the armed people who moved into the bandit areas will be borne by the Border Area Bandit Suppression Headquarters. I believe that the people of our country have a deep sense of homeland and are unwilling to leave their homeland and move to a foreign land. Therefore, the resettlement of the people who are moved out is really a difficult task. In order to avoid this difficulty, it is best to choose a wasteland near the bandit area and move them there. This not only meets their attachment to their homeland, but also achieves the practical effect of resettling migrants and eliminating bandits. In the future, when the remaining bandits are defeated, it will be more convenient to return to their hometowns. Commander-in-Chief Liu expressed his great approval of this plan. In addition to Commander-in-Chief Liu going to Nanchang to report to Chiang Kai-shek first, I will also make a presentation and ask for approval for implementation. Regarding the joint issuance of silver dollar notes by the two banks, all the measures have been completely decided, and the two banks will jointly organize a public treasury. The candidate for the head of the treasury has also been internally determined (said to be former Director of Finance Shen Zhaonian). After the establishment of the public treasury, silver dollar notes will be issued, and the reserve will be kept by the public treasury to ensure that they can be cashed at any time. This matter will also be reported in detail to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek when I go to Jiangxi," and so on.</p>
<p>Provincial Chairman Zhang Qun previously received a telegram from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, ordering him to draft measures to reverse the declining trends in the counties of southern Hubei, where the local customs are lazy and particularly fond of gambling. After receiving the order, Zhang immediately ordered the Civil Affairs, Construction, and Education Departments to jointly draft measures and submit them for approval. On the 21st, they had drafted and submitted them to the Provincial Government. The measures are divided into two parts: active and passive. Active aspects: (1) Revitalize the rural economy: 1. Establish branches of the Four Provinces Farmers Bank; 2. Organize credit cooperatives in various counties; 3. Promote the warehouse system; (2) Develop transportation and develop industries; (3) Education: 1. School education; 2. Compulsory education; 3. Social education; (4) Resettle refugees and grant them land for cultivation; (5) Improve customs and promote thrift. Passive aspects: (1) Eliminate idleness; (2) Strictly prohibit opium and gambling.

<h3 id="e84">The Pseudo 15th Army Corps Suffers a Disastrous Defeat in Attacking Daxiongguan; Over a Thousand Bandits Killed, and Twice as Many Wounded; Li and Guo Divisions Achieve Miraculous Feats <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: On the 12th of this month, the pseudo 7th Army Corps penetrated into Xuwan, dozens of miles away from Fu, and planned to ambush the pseudo 3rd Army Corps in the Maodian area, attempting to attack Fuzhou. Fortunately, the Xing Division took a roundabout route from Langju to aid Xu, joining forces with the 36th Division to completely defeat the pseudo 37th Army Corps. The bandits then retreated to the Xiaoshi area. Unexpectedly, they again used the pseudo 1st and 5th Army Corps to attack Yihuang. Fortunately, the Li Yannian and Guo Siyan Divisions of the National Army stationed in Yihuang advanced from Tangyin to Yongxing Quanshi. The bandits in that area fled south to Dangkou. On the 19th, the Zhu bandits suddenly launched an attack on Daxiongguan (between Yongxing Bridge and Rao, south of Yihuang) from Shagang Shangdangkou, and the Shengang areas by Lin Biao's pseudo 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Divisions and Dong Zhentang's 13th, 14th, and 15th Divisions, with great ferocity. At the same time, small groups harassed Xianfang between Yihuang and Fuzhou in an attempt to cut off the National Army's transportation. At that time, the Li Division firmly defended its original position, relying on fortifications to strike the bandits head-on with intensive charges. After several hours of bloody battle, they finally defeated the bandits. At about 1:00 p.m. on the 20th, the General Headquarters received a phone call from Fuzhou stating, "The pseudo 15th Army Corps attacking the Li Division's position at Daxiongguan was completely repulsed by us, killing over a thousand bandits and wounding twice as many. We captured 29 machine guns and 1,500 rifles. The remaining bandits are retreating south and are being pursued." Further news from Fuzhou stated that the pseudo 37th Army Corps, which had previously attacked Xuwan from Jinxi, was still lingering around Zixi Jinxi, and from time to time raided near Xuwan from Langju Zuofangying, but were all defeated by the local defense forces. According to captured bandit soldiers in Xuwan, the 19th and 20th Divisions, which attacked Xu, were Fang Shaobu's elite troops and lost most of their strength. The pseudo 4th, 5th, and 6th Divisions, which fought a bloody battle with the National Army's 4th Division at Fengshanpu, were Peng Dehuai's main force and were also almost completely wiped out. From this, it can be seen that there are hardly any remnants of the bandits left. (November 20th)</p>

<p>The bandit Wu Qingxiang, a major criminal who robbed the family of Fan Bingnan, a villager in Panshe Township, District 16, was arrested. After interrogation by the county government, the facts were clear. Due to the seriousness of the case, the county government sent Police Chief Dong Futang and others in vehicle number 36 yesterday to escort him to the Zhenjiang Provincial Security Department for trial.</p>
<h3 id="e86">The Verification of an Old Woman in Suzhou Strangling Her Prodigal Son <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>The old woman Fei Fan, from Miaojiaoshang Village, at the foot of Mount Shizi in the Mudu District of Suzhou, owned hundreds of acres of good land. She had three sons: the eldest named Laohu (Tiger), the second Asi (Four), and the youngest Genhu (Root Tiger). They had all married and lived separately. Asi lived with his mother, his wife Qiu, his son Tugen, and his daughter-in-law in the old house. Laohu and Genhu lived separately and were both hardworking, thrifty, and law-abiding. However, Asi developed a habit of smoking opium more than ten years ago, did not engage in production, and sold off his land year by year. Recently, as he became more impoverished, his behavior became even worse, earning him the disdain of the entire village. Fortunately, his mother, wife, son, and daughter-in-law were still able to support themselves. Recently, Asi asked his mother for money for opium, and when he was refused, he often beat and abused her. On the 13th of this month, news suddenly came that Asi had hanged himself. The court approved an exemption from autopsy. Afterwards, it was widely rumored that Asi had been strangled to death by his mother, and that his wife Qiu and his brother Genhu were involved. Therefore, the Fifth Branch of the Public Security Bureau arrested Fei Fan, Fei Qiu, and the local guarantor Li Songting and sent them to the local court in the city. Yesterday (22nd), prosecutor Lu Wenqin, clerk Xuan Fang, and forensic doctor Mao Yaoting were sent by the local prosecutor's office to the village for an autopsy. Since the body had already been buried, they immediately exhumed the grave and opened the coffin. Upon examination, it was found that the skin of Asi's corpse was very white, which was inconsistent with the redness of the skin of a person who had hanged himself and whose blood had settled. There was a very obvious rope mark on the back of his neck, and there was blood in his mouth and nose. There were injuries on his hands, feet, and face. It was clear that he had been strangled to death. After filling out the coroner's report, they summoned the deceased's son, Tugen, for questioning. According to his statement, his father's behavior was usually absurd, and his grandmother was dissatisfied with him. He did not know why he died because he was at his wife's home at the time. The judge also investigated the villagers and learned that the deceased's wife, Qiu, usually treated her mother-in-law with great filial piety. Whether she colluded with her aunt to strangle her husband is still under investigation. The deceased's brother, Genhu, was also afraid of being implicated and had already fled without a trace. The judge immediately returned to the city to report the information for further investigation.</p>

<p>Zhou Zhenyi, the adopted son of the deceased wealthy merchant Zhou Nianqin of Yinma Bridge, Hulong Street, sued his grandmother, Xu, for failing to hand over the inheritance of 400,000 yuan in cash, 3,000 mu of fields, and 19 houses left by his deceased father, which had been managed by his grandmother, Xu. He claimed that he had now started a family and was entitled to inherit the estate. He had repeatedly asked his grandmother to hand it over, but she had refused. Therefore, he filed a lawsuit in court. Yesterday (22nd), the court ruled that the defendant should pay the plaintiff one-half of Zhou Nianqin's estate, totaling 650 mu of fields and 17 houses, as well as 3,000 silver dollars.</p>

<p>The labor dispute in the local garment industry has been brewing for several days and has not yet been resolved. County Magistrate Yan Shenyu, in order to mediate, convened representatives of the silk and satin industry's "new outfit" department to the county on the 21st of this month, together with the Party Headquarters and the Chamber of Commerce, for talks. As a result, two principles of mediation were decided: (1) The silk and satin industry's "new outfit" department shall not create gift items and other pretexts to solicit business by improper means; (2) The price of Chinese garments should be in accordance with the general standards of the garment industry and should not be deliberately suppressed. At the same time, County Magistrate Yan convened a second meeting with the industry and said that although the current garment industry dispute was ostensibly caused by the "new outfit" department, the root cause was actually the unfair competition within the silk and satin industry. The dispute between the garment industry and the "new outfit" department has been resolved by the government and the Party Headquarters together. However, the silk and satin industry is engaging in open and secret struggles, vying with each other to offer gifts and price reductions, which may lead to disputes at any time. It has now been decided that all silk and satin shops should cancel all items such as extra sizes, price reductions, and gifts by the end of this month. From December onwards, the guild should discuss and formulate uniform measures and formulate disciplinary measures for those who violate industry regulations, and report them to the Party and government organs for record, in order to permanently eliminate disputes. The representatives of the silk industry who attended the meeting unanimously agreed. As for the garment industry guild, because this labor dispute has been fairly mediated by the Party and government authorities, a stage has been reached. Yesterday, it specially notified all members to resume work from today.</p>

<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance, according to investigator Zhou Zhengyuan, found that the business tax payments for the summer and autumn seasons of this year paid by the three pharmacies Peng Taihe, Dade Sheng, and Tongsong, and the Tianfu general merchandise store in Yangzhou, did not match the reports on the review reports of the county business bureau. Moreover, the tax payments paid by each industry each quarter were mostly ratified by the guild of the same industry and apportioned by store, without receipts. The Department believed that the Business Tax Bureau had engaged in corruption and had enriched itself, and immediately dismissed Li Mingqian, the Director of the 6th District and Bureau. It also secretly telegraphed County Magistrate Ma to have Li placed under surveillance and await investigation. On the evening of the 20th, the county sent the Chief Inspector of Public Security to lead the police to Li's private residence, where Li was arrested and detained at the Bureau to await the Department's handling.

<p>Outside the East Gate of Huaiyin, the most lively area, apart from Huajie, is the Wenmiao Street. Therefore, the residents' houses there are closely arranged and densely populated. Yesterday, at 3:00 p.m., a careless accident occurred in the home of Fan Yucheng, a water carrier in Hejia Lane, that place. Since both Fan Yucheng and his wife were not at home, the fire spread greatly, extending to the houses of neighboring residents downwind. For a time, the flames filled the sky and could not be contained. Dozens of water dragons, both Chinese and foreign, went to the scene to fight the fire and demolished the houses connected to the fire site. At about 5:00 p.m., the fire was extinguished, but it had already burned down more than 20 households, totaling 70 to 80 rooms of various sizes.

<h3 id="e97">City News: Various Sectors Express Strong Condemnation of the Fujian Incident, Telegrams Urge Clear Order to Punish Chen and Li, Hoping the 19th Route Army Will Awaken <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Party Headquarters telegraphed the Kuomin News Agency, stating that the Municipal Party Headquarters yesterday telegraphed the Central Government, urgently requesting the National Government to issue a clear order to suppress Chen Mingshu and Li Jishen, and also telegraphed Jiang Guangnai and Cai Tingkai, urging them to awaken quickly to preserve the past honor of the 19th Route Army. The full texts of the two telegrams are recorded below: "Telegram One" Urgent, Respectfully to the Nanjing Central Executive Committee: Recently, we read in the newspaper that Chen Mingshu, Li Jishen, and others gathered so-called National People's Representatives in the Fujian provincial capital to establish a People's Government, which is deeply shocking. We believe that Chen Mingshu and Li Jishen, as members of the Central Committee, should dedicate themselves to the Party and the country and jointly save the critical situation in this time of national crisis. Now, they have colluded with all reactionary elements to form an illegal government. Such behavior is extremely illegal. We urge your committee to quickly order the National Government to issue a clear order to suppress them in order to eliminate the rebels and maintain discipline. We are extremely hopeful. Sincerely, Shanghai Special Municipality Executive Committee, with seal. "Telegram Two" Fuzhou, to be delivered to Mr. Jiang Guangnai and Mr. Cai Tingkai: We heard that the Fujian Incident broke out suddenly, and they dared to unite with the Communist bandits and collude with the violent Japanese to rebel against the Central Government. The news is shocking and inexplicable. We believe that the two gentlemen are pillars of our party, and their contributions to resisting Japan and suppressing the Communists are beneficial to the party and the country. Judging from past history, this rebellion was likely instigated by a few scoundrels and was not the original intention of the two gentlemen. However, the two gentlemen are officials appointed by the Central Government and have a responsibility to defend the territory. They did not stop it before and are now listed in an illegal organization, colluding with each other and willingly becoming bandits. This is tantamount to using the party to oppose the party, using resistance to Japan to appease Japan, and using suppression of bandits to surrender to bandits. The contradictions in their lives cannot but be regretted. Moreover, this kind of action, regardless of the complex elements and contradictory ideas, is bound to fail. Even if we take a step back, in the past one or two years, the two gentlemen have imposed excessive taxes and levies in Fujian, which has made the people of Fujian suffer. If the two gentlemen really want to love the country and benefit the people, they should start by eliminating abusive policies and governing Fujian well. But they do not do this, and instead want to harm the whole country with the disasters in Fujian. This will not only be condemned by the people of the country, but also be disallowed by the facts, only harming the country and the people and leaving a bad name for thousands of years. We believe that the two gentlemen should not do this. In order to preserve the past honor of the 19th Route Army and the past personality of the two gentlemen, they should quickly awaken, arrest all the ugly villains and offer them to the Central Government, and cancel the illegal organization to apologize to the people of the country. Then the sincerity of the two gentlemen can still be forgiven by the world. The telegram is urgent, and we hope you will accept it. Shanghai Special Municipality Executive Committee, with seal.</p>
<p>The Second District Party Headquarters telegraphed all compatriots throughout the country yesterday, saying, "All compatriots throughout the country, since the violent neighbors invaded and the lost land has not been recovered, and the red bandits are rampant and can be wiped out, it is at this time of national emergency and survival that all the people of the country should be united in one heart and one mind to save the nation from the brink of death. However, the news of the rebellion has come, and Li Jishen, Chen Mingshu, and others dare to collude with the Communist bandits, establish names cleverly, plot to resist the Central Government, and recklessly do things that are wrong. It is small to deceive oneself, but it extends the bandit trouble and harms the party and the country, which is a sin that cannot be pardoned. We hope that our compatriots will rise up together to plan for it and telegraph the Central Government to issue a clear order to suppress it in order to eliminate the national traitors and lay the foundation for the country. This is very fortunate. Sincerely, the Shanghai Special Municipality Second District Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, with seal."</p>
<p>More than one hundred trade associations telegraphed the New Voice News Agency, saying that the trade associations of various industries in the city yesterday issued two joint telegrams, which are recorded below: (1) Telegram to the Central Government, to Chairman Lin of the Nanjing National Government, President Wang of the Executive Yuan, and Chairman Jiang of the Military Commission: The national affairs are in chaos, and the rivers and mountains are fragmented, which has reached its limit. Today's China must eliminate the red bandits in order to talk about internal peace, and without internal peace, it is impossible to talk about resisting foreign aggression. This is the established policy of the Central Government, and it has been working hard to achieve it in recent years. At this time when the national army is encircling and suppressing the red bandits and reporting victories, the rebellion in Fujian suddenly arose from within the walls. Hearing this from afar, how can we not sigh with regret? Although the rebellion of these one or two ambitious people is not enough to affect the central government, the phenomenon of collapse and disintegration is rooted in internal strife. The melons under Huangtai cannot be picked again, and one or two treacherous and giant moths still want to cleverly establish a political system, spreading rumors to frighten people, falsely claiming to be sharing and sharing, but in fact harming the country and the people. This not only gives foreign enemies and domestic bandits an opportunity to take advantage of, but also severely limits the people of the whole province to a place of no return. Speaking of this, we cannot help but feel heartache and weep. We hope that before this situation expands, we will resolve the Fujian Incident with swift action to stabilize people's livelihood and comfort the public's expectations. At the same time, we still ask the Central Government to continue to work hard according to the original plan to encircle and suppress the red bandits in order to achieve it thoroughly. The success or failure of the party and the country depends on this, and we hope to consider and plan quickly. The telegram is hurried, and we hope you will understand. Sincerely, Shanghai Sugar Industry, Paper Industry, Cotton Cloth Industry, Woolen Industry, Silk Industry, North-South Goods Industry, Sausage Industry, Mineral Ash Industry, Rice Industry, and more than one hundred trade associations, with seal. (1) Letter to the generals of the 19th Route Army in Fuzhou: In the past, your army fought bravely in Shanghai, risking death to fight against the Japanese invaders. Although you ultimately failed to resist the violence, your righteous reputation has spread throughout China and abroad. At that time, our trade associations and people from all walks of life did their best to help you kill the enemy. The soldiers sighed and said that in past civil wars, they had never been so respected by the people. This shows that the people deeply hate and abhor internal strife and hope that the soldiers can sacrifice themselves to resist foreign aggression. This has been fully expressed in the Songhu Anti-Japanese War. As the saying goes, those who travel a hundred miles are only halfway there at ninety. It is difficult to live up to a good reputation, and it is a pity that the end is not as good as the beginning. Your army sacrificed the heads of thousands of brave soldiers and exhausted the people's resources to win a glorious page in the history of resistance to Japan. How should you persevere in your original intention and maintain your good reputation forever? However, strong enemies are pressing in Hebei, and disasters suddenly arise within the walls. How can we not sigh with regret? All the rumors of war are used by treacherous and giant moths to justify their treacherous words. Even if they can confuse people for a while, they will inevitably be ridiculed in history. Moreover, the public is right and wrong in the present world has not been completely eliminated. China is so fragmented that it is still fighting for the gains and losses of chickens and insects. How can collapse and disintegration be avoided? However, you are now held hostage by one or two ambitious people and follow them in rebellious acts against the country, creating opportunities for foreign enemies and domestic bandits, ruining your past good reputation, and being intolerable to the whole country. Even the wisest people could not have expected their miscalculation to be so great. In the past, Zhu Fu warned Peng Chong, "Do not do anything that is feared by relatives and rejoiced by enemies." We are honored to have a friendly relationship with your army, so we dare to offer our last foolish words. If you accept them, it will be a blessing for the overall situation. Sincerely, Shanghai Sugar Industry, Paper Industry, Cotton Cloth Industry, Woolen Industry, Silk Industry, North-South Goods Industry, Sausage Industry, Mineral Ash Industry, Rice Industry, and more than one hundred trade associations, with seal.</p>
<p>The Second Special District Municipal Federation telegraphed the Kuomin News Agency, saying that the Second Special District Citizens' Federation of this city sent a telegram yesterday to advise Jiang and Cai, "(Title omitted) Recently, we read in the newspaper that you gathered so-called People's Government in Fujian, which is deeply shocking. Recalling your actions in the January 28 Incident, your loyalty, bravery, and contributions to the party and the country were admirable throughout the world. At this time when the national crisis has not been alleviated and the red bandits are about to be wiped out, you should be diligent and courageous in seeking national affairs together, so as to maintain your glorious history. Moreover, when you left Shanghai for Fujian, you declared that you would never participate in civil wars again. Now, you are organizing a government and resisting the Central Government, obviously wanting to provoke a civil war and plunge the country and the nation into a place of no return. We hereby offer our last sincere advice, hoping that you will awaken and cancel the illegal organization in order to seek self-renewal. You must know that your past honor was bestowed by the citizens of Shanghai. It is not a pity that you are ruined and disgraced, but our past sacrifices are truly painful. Pull back before it's too late, and things can still be done. Please consider it carefully. Shanghai Second Special District Citizens' Federation, with seal."</p>
<p>The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions telegraphed the Nanjing National Government: Recently, we read in the newspaper that Chen Mingshu and others established a so-called People's Government in Fuzhou, which is deeply painful and indignant. We believe that Chen Mingshu and others, whether they are members of the Central Committee or local officials, should be united in spirit and jointly seek national affairs at this time when the national crisis has not been alleviated and the red bandits are waiting to be suppressed. Now, they are digging their own graves, colluding with all reactionary elements, and organizing an illegal government, claiming to resist Japan and suppress bandits, but in fact uniting with Japan and tolerating the Communists. This is extremely perverse. We urge your government to quickly send a large army and issue a clear order to suppress them in order to stabilize the party and the country and save the people from the abyss of suffering. The telegram is sent with anticipation. Sincerely, Shanghai Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, with seal.</p>
<p>The Municipal Farmers' Association telegraphed (title omitted) When the rebellion in Fujian Province began, this association was deeply concerned that the situation would expand and harm the country. It immediately issued a letter to the generals of Fujian Province, correcting errors, pointing out the wrong path, hoping that they would repent and turn hostility into friendship. Unexpectedly, the telegram was sent in the morning, and the news of the rebellion was spread in the evening. Independence, changing flags, detaining weapons and intercepting taxes, organizing a false government, issuing orders, and acting like a country. The measures were extremely perverse. It can be seen that the wolf's ambition and the harboring of evil intentions and the desire to seize the power of the country is not a matter of one day. This association still hoped that they would repent and change their ways, which is probably too foolish. Chen, Li, Jiang, and Cai have dared to defy the great taboo of the world, betray the party and harm the country, destroy unity, collude with reactionaries, and isolate themselves from the people. Then our people throughout the country should rise up together to condemn them and be the backing of the government. We hope that the government will quickly make a plan to eliminate this and bring the compatriots of Fujian Province out of the abyss of suffering and put them on the mat. Sincerely, Shanghai Municipal Farmers' Association, with seal.</p>
<p>The University Federation telegraphed the Shanghai News Agency, saying that the Shanghai University Students' Federation telegraphed the Central Party Headquarters yesterday, saying that the Central Party Headquarters knew that Chen Mingshu was colluding with frustrated bureaucrats and shameless literati in Fujian to establish a name and carry out rebellion. We are extremely indignant when we hear about it. The national crisis is more serious than ever today. All Chinese people should unite and concentrate their efforts under the leadership of the Central Government to save the situation. However, Chen Mingshu acted perversely and dared to rebel when the Central Army was winning victory after victory in suppressing the Communists. He did not hesitate to put the people of Fujian Province under the sword and give the remaining red bandits a chance to revive. He betrayed the party and misled the country, and his crimes were full. If such a person with no national concept or national consciousness is allowed to remain in the party, it would be a great shame for our party. We urge you to permanently expel him from the party. After expulsion, he must not be granted amnesty. We also ask you to order all levels of party headquarters to condemn him in order to maintain party discipline and uphold public morale. The telegram is sent with urgency and we await orders. Sincerely, Shanghai University Students' Federation, with seal.</p>
<p>The Guangdong Fellow Association telegraphed the Guangdong Fellow Association, advising Li, Chen, and others, saying, "Member Li Jishen, Member Chen Mingshu, Chairman Jiang Guangnai, Commander-in-Chief Cai Tingkai, and all the army division and brigade commanders stationed in Fujian: The national crisis is severe, and the bandit trouble has not ended. The only chance for the country and the nation to survive cannot withstand the devastation of internal strife. However, bad news has come that the Fujian Incident has been brewing and has become a reality. We are heartbroken to hear the news. You are revolutionary pioneers and pillars of the party and the country. The Songhu Anti-Japanese War was especially loved and respected by the people of the country. Now, because of slight differences in political views, you have taken extreme measures and misunderstood the Central Government's measures in many ways. Moreover, rumors are spreading that not only are various reactionary groups active in Zhangzhou and Xiamen, but also the Communist bandits have taken the opportunity to participate in the incident in order to achieve their goals. If this is true, the consequences are unimaginable. Today, what opinions cannot be eliminated and what disputes cannot be tolerated? If you insist on abandoning the right path and going astray, it will not only be painful for your relatives and rejoiced by your enemies, but also the life of the country and the nation will be plunged into a place of no return. Our association, in view of the seriousness of the disaster and fearing the imminence of destruction, takes the meaning of the Spring and Autumn Period to blame the wise and offers sincere advice, intruding on your ears. We hope that you will pull back before it's too late and change your plans, automatically cancel the Fujian Province organization, and resolve everything politically, unite sincerely, and jointly complete the great cause of national rejuvenation. This is not only what our association prays for. The telegram is urgent and we are filled with fear. Sincerely, Guangdong Fellow Association Restructuring Committee in Shanghai, with seal.</p>

<p>Chen Jiliang Returned to Shanghai from Beijing: The New Voice News Agency reported that Vice Minister of the Navy Chen Jiliang returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday after flying to Beijing to discuss the naval issues in Fujian Province at the invitation of President Wang. Chen's return to Shanghai has the important task of being ordered to go to Fujian to handle the coastal defense of Fujian Province. According to Chen's statement to the reporter of the New Voice News Agency yesterday, his trip to Fujian still requires some preparation and observation of the changes in the situation in Fujian, so the timing is still uncertain. The two ships that were detained are hydrographic survey ships and have nothing to do with military affairs. The Mawei telegram has been suspended since the day before yesterday, and the Navy Department's radio has also been cut off, so no telegram reports have been received in the past two days. Xiamen is still as calm as usual. After Director Chen (Wenlin) flew to Xiamen, he has not received a telegram from him. Whether the aircraft in Fujian need to leave Fujian depends on Director Chen's inspection of the situation in Xiamen after his arrival. After the fleet stationed in Fujian left Fujian, there has been no follow-up news. Later, it was added that the saying that Sa Zhenbing was appointed as the governor of Fujian Province is definitely not true. He Gonggan was originally a die-hard follower of Chen Mingshu, so there is no value in paying attention to it, etc.</p>
<p>Sun Xiewen and Others Came to Shanghai Together: The People's Voice News Agency reported that after the Fujian coup was realized, Sun Xiewen, the director of the Fujian Provincial Committee and Director of the Construction Department, who had a very close relationship with the 19th Route Army, expressed his inability to cooperate and resolutely resigned from his position as Director of the Construction Department. The vacancy has been filled by Zeng Qian, the former Director of Civil Affairs of Guangdong. The reporter of the People's Voice News Agency learned yesterday that Mr. Sun, together with Provincial Committee members Lin Zhiyuan and Gao Dengting, and Chen Peikun, the former Director of the Finance Department and the current Director of the Jin Province Relief Office, left Fujian on the Huaan merchant ship on the 20th and arrived in port yesterday. It was also heard that many pieces of Mr. Chen Peikun's luggage were detained by the military police at the Nantai Bridgehead (according to the passage from Fuzhou to Majiang by boat). The four gentlemen in Fujian have heard and witnessed the details of this coup in detail and will report to the Central Government in Beijing immediately.</p>
<p>Long Yongxuan Was Forced to Come to Shanghai: The Dagong News Agency reported that since the outbreak of the coup in Fujian Province, the Fuzhou Unified Tax Administration Office under the jurisdiction of the Central Government was confiscated by the so-called People's Government on the 18th, and the affiliated unified tax branch offices were also forcibly taken over. Long Yongxuan, the original director of the office, in order to report the truth to the Central Government, immediately set off for Shanghai, because all unified tax affairs have been taken over by Mai Ming. The Long family and the tax authorities received this telegram yesterday and are expected to arrive in Shanghai in the coming days.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Citizens' Association for the Promotion of Domestic Goods, in order to promote domestic goods to the countryside, led the Shanghai Domestic Goods Traveling Group to hold domestic goods exhibitions in Bengbu and Xuzhou, giving farmers the concept of recognizing domestic goods and providing manufacturers with opportunities to promote their products. The National Goods Movement was expanded and publicized with concentrated efforts. Now that it has expired and closed, the representatives of the factories, 187 people, led by Ren Suizhi, Zhao Jinsheng, Lu Yichu, etc., took the Pinghu United Train and arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning to return to their respective factories for rest. Yesterday, according to Mr. Xu Qiaoqi, the director-general of the association, this association used the remaining work to try to find a way out for the products of various factories, led them to Bengbu and Xuzhou, held a national exhibition for one week each, publicized domestic goods, and awakened the motive for the people to use domestic goods and develop the national ability to save the country. Surprisingly, the two or three merchants in Bengbu were more interested in their rights than in patriotism, and did not understand the great significance of promoting domestic goods. They misunderstood the truth of dumping and were deeply obsessed with superficial interests. They used the opportunity to advocate opposition. Fortunately, Wang Jun, the commander of the Third Army stationed in Bengbu, He Guoliang, the director of the Public Security Bureau, and Zhou Dezhi, the curator of the People's Education Hall, upheld justice and were responsible for protecting and eliminating misunderstandings. The opening ceremony was held as scheduled. All the shops in the city warmly welcomed, purchased goods in batches, and signed contracts for promotion. Farmers came to the meeting to visit, which was especially enthusiastic. The total sales volume was 74,326.26 yuan, and the products of Sanyou Industrial Society, Wuhe Weaving Factory, Limin Dyeing and Weaving Factory, and Meiya Silk Weaving Factory had the largest sales volume. The Xuzhou National Exhibition proceeded smoothly, but it was regrettable that it was adjacent to a fire and there was a money squeeze. Fortunately, preventive measures were taken to avoid losses. Yu Nianci, the county magistrate, Wang Jun, the commander of the Third Army, Long Ciyun, the director of the Political Training Department, Wang Shicai, the director of the Public Security Bureau, Lan Bohua, the chairman of the County Chamber of Commerce, Rui Zhenxiang, the member of the County Party Department, and Zhao Guangtao, the director of the Provincial People's Education Hall, provided meticulous protection and assisted in the process, which gave them a lot of convenience. The venue was crowded with visitors every day. The total sales volume was 69,781.47 yuan, especially the products of Hongxin Dyeing and Weaving Factory, Dalong Woolen Factory, Zhanghua Woolen Factory, China Chemical Industry Society, Tianchu MSG Factory, etc., which were very popular among farmers and sold out. Under the situation of social unrest and rural economic bankruptcy, this achievement is deeply gratifying. The work was tense and the spirit was slightly painful, but the service of domestic goods was not spared. After the association's extensive publicity, the merchants in Bengbu and Xuzhou have expressed their sincere cooperation in promoting domestic goods and forming a permanent business place, which is especially gratifying. The representatives of the participating factories will be convened in a few days to report on the progress of the association's affairs and design the organization of the two domestic goods markets.</p>

<p>Since the implementation of cotton control by Mr. Song Ziwen, Standing Committee Member of the National Economic Commission, it has progressed smoothly. Control committees for other industries such as grain, silk, minerals, and coal also need to be actively pursued for their establishment in due course.

Opinions were exchanged and discussions were held. It is reported that the organizational methods will be based on the model of the Cotton Control Committee. As for the candidates for the committee members, they will be recruited equally from the financial sector and the grain industry. Hu Mengjia has already been internally designated as the chairman. Other committee members are being sought, and it is planned to formally establish the committee within this year once suitable candidates are found. It is also reported that after the establishment of the committee, its initial work will follow the example of the Cotton Control Committee, first sending personnel to various provinces and cities to conduct on-site investigations into the annual grain production and sales situation, and then proceeding with the adjustment of surpluses and deficits.</p>

<p>According to the Xin Xin News Agency, since the truce agreement in North China, the tense atmosphere between China and Japan has temporarily eased. Our country's boycott of Japanese goods has also gradually subsided. Japanese merchants are taking advantage of the opportunity to import inferior goods in large quantities. It was recently learned from reliable sources that Japanese merchants have recently shipped large quantities of inferior ginseng, intending to peddle them to various ginseng and medicine shops in this city. However, due to the precedent of Shen Feng and other eight rice shops buying and selling Japanese rice, these shops are taking a wait-and-see approach and dare not openly sell the ginseng. Seeing that the situation is not favorable, the Japanese merchants have changed their strategy and are particularly enticing unscrupulous merchants to go to Suzhou, Wuxi, Zhenjiang, Nanjing, and other ports to sell the ginseng. In order to dump the goods, they are lowering the prices to attract customers. It is hoped that the various ginseng and medicine shops will pay attention and not be deceived.</p>

<h3 id="e113">Silk Weaving and Silk Brocade Industries Appeal for Prompt Refund of Artificial Silk Re-Export Tax to Rescue Sales of Nanyang Silk and Recover International Trade <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>The Electrical Silk Weaving Factory Industry Association and the Silk Brocade Industry Association of this city, noting the severe decline in overseas silk sales, went to Beijing in June of this year to petition for the refund of the artificial silk tax. The government adopted their request and agreed to provide relief. Recently, sales in the Nanyang region have been hampered because Japanese goods are being sold at lower prices in that area, causing Chinese silk to be unable to compete in sales. Trade has temporarily stalled, and the situation is serious. Therefore, yesterday, the two associations reported the situation to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry, requesting a prompt refund of the artificial silk re-export tax in order to reduce prices, provide urgent relief, and rescue international trade. The original petition is recorded below:</p>
<p>Petition for the Nanyang silk sales to be relieved, as the silk weaving industry is on the verge of bankruptcy, and requesting a prompt refund of the artificial silk re-export tax to aid in the rescue of foreign trade. It is true that the associations have previously reported that the silk brocade business is in a precarious situation, and representatives were sent on June 6 of this year to present everything in person and request the refund of the artificial silk re-export tax to aid in the rescue of overseas silk sales. Subsequently, the Ministry issued Order No. [missing number], which stated [original text omitted] besides exempting the full text from record, the end stated that if the merchants in the industry could specially form a factory that is convenient for customs management, negotiate with customs to establish a bonded manufacturing method, the cost of products can actually be reduced, which is also convenient for foreign trade. This order is hereby notified. Upon receiving this order, we investigated and planned to establish bonded warehouses for manufacturing goods to reduce the burden of products. This was originally the government's intention to care for the hardships of merchants. It could have been without endless complaints. Subsequently, after repeated consideration by the associations, it was unanimously believed that the silk weaving industry, having survived this catastrophe, is only barely surviving to this day. How can we plan for further development? Furthermore, the regulations for this bonded warehouse for manufacturing goods have not yet been established. If we wait for negotiations to be completed, it may not be a matter of a day or two. However, the decline of national silk brocade is like a stack of eggs. How can we delay the rescue? Recently, sales of Chinese silk brocade in the Nanyang region have been hampered. The reason is that Japan, seeing that we have repeatedly increased heavy taxes, resulting in high costs, has taken the opportunity to reduce prices and dump goods as much as possible, in order to compete with our country in international industry and commerce, resulting in Chinese silk brocade being unable to compete in sales, and foreign trade has suddenly stopped. Looking back at the domestic market, it is even more eroded by foreign goods, and the bankruptcy of rural areas. The current situation of silk sales is that there is no escape from losses. In this way, the business is already in extreme danger. If we do not urgently seek relief, then the opportunity for bankruptcy is imminent. Thinking of this, how can we not be worried? The government's plan to save the country should prioritize promoting industry. Therefore, when the Shanghai-Wuxi silk factory closed down, it was specially allowed to issue 4 million yuan in relief bonds. Recently, when yarn factories were in a panic, cotton and wheat loans were used to subsidize them. It can be seen that the government cares for the hardships of the people in every possible way. Today, many silk weaving factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang are closed, and the number of unemployed workers is no less than that of silk and yarn factories. Although we dare not follow the example of asking for the issuance of public bonds, and even less do we seek loans to rescue industry, the associations, being alert to their own interests, appeal for the refund of the artificial silk re-export tax to relieve the urgent crisis. This should not be an excessive request. Otherwise, once silk weaving goes bankrupt and workers lose their jobs, it will be too late to try to rescue them after the situation has deteriorated to the point of collapse. The difference between success and failure will be far apart. Therefore, we are submitting this joint petition to further describe the obstructed sales of Nanyang silk. We beseech you to examine and approve our request, considering that silk weaving is in danger, and approve the refund of the artificial silk re-export tax in order to aid in the rescue of foreign trade and maintain the employment of workers. We cannot express our pressing need to await orders enough.</p>

<p>The Shanghai electricity labor dispute has been temporarily resolved after Mr. Fei Xidun and Mr. Du Yuesheng officially mediated with the company and negotiated several times. All workers in the new and old plants resumed work yesterday morning. The order was good and no incidents occurred. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Resumption of Work: Since Mr. Fei Xidun and Du Yuesheng officially started mediation, and after Chinese directors Yuan Ludeng, Yu Qiaqing, Xu Xinliu, Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, and Ku Yanfang agreed on the preconditions, all workers, in consideration of public safety and stability, and in obedience to the advice of the mediators, decided to resume work yesterday morning. At 7 a.m. yesterday morning, workers from the new and old plants successively entered the plants to resume work. The company was deeply concerned that there might be temporary changes, so it specially asked the police to send detectives to protect the factory entrances. The order of the workers was good, and no incidents occurred. More than 50 workers were not allowed back to work so they did not resume work. The original mediators will be responsible for negotiating with the company to obtain severance pay and bonuses.</p>
<p>Company Notice: The Shanghai Electric Power Company posted the resumption of work measures at the gates of the old factory on Feilun Road and the new factory on Dongting Road the first night. The translation reads: "Notice to the workers of the Shanghai Electric Power Company: Our company now stipulates the following two measures for resumption of work: (1) All workers employed by the company tomorrow (i.e., the 22nd) will continue to be paid the benefits or rights they were entitled to before, without any changes.

<p>After a strike occurred among garment workers in 34 fashion companies in the city, including Huali, due to employers deducting wages, the labor union negotiated with the employers to make up for the original wages (2.20 yuan) and, in accordance with the labor-management agreement of the previous year, increased wages by another 40 cents.

However, Fannuoxinna, Jinchangxiang, Fanhua, Tianxiang, and four other stores have not yet recognized the agreement. The Garment Workers' Union specially ordered the workers of these four stores to resume work first, and the wage issue will be negotiated by the labor union and increased as usual. The workers all obeyed the order and started working. It is heard that the wages of these four stores should be fully resolved within a few days. Furthermore, after the reorganization of the Garment Workers' Union, the new directors are scheduled to be sworn in on the 16th of next month.</p>

<p>Since the Traffic Department's Shanghai Telephone Bureau officially launched the automatic telephone system in April of this year, urban traffic has been improving day by day. In order to develop group-run businesses and do its best to serve the public, the bureau has been actively building branch bureaus in various districts and expanding lines. Yesterday, engineer Yu Jian told the Dagong News reporter in detail about the various renovations in Zhabei and the increase in relay equipment. The details are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e129">Zhabei Cable Project <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Since the January 28 Incident in Shanghai the year before last, all lines in Zhabei were destroyed by artillery fire. After the end of the military operations, the bureau formulated a three-stage project for restoration and expansion in order to restore traffic. The first stage was to reorganize the Ming line of Tanziwan and install 50 pairs of cables to and from the Central Mint of Xiaoshadu, starting from the Zhabei branch bureau, and 25 pairs of round trip lines from the Central Mint to Fanwangdu. The project has been completed, and the reorganization of the area around Xingjiaqiao is currently underway. The second phase is to replace the telephone poles, and the third phase is to expand the lines near the area of cross-border road construction in the northern district of the Chinese concession.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Increase Relay Equipment <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>There are a total of 30 pairs of telephone lines from the Zhabei Branch to the Nanshi Headquarters. After the municipal government moves to the central urban area in the future, the Zhabei Branch will occupy an important position in transportation. It is now planned to appropriately increase the relay equipment of all branch bureaus and the concession area. Moreover, there are many users near Yuejie Road who are requesting to install telephones, and the original lines are not enough to allocate. The bureau plans to increase the capacity as much as possible in the third phase of the expansion plan. The materials required have been approved by the Ministry of Transportation, and the Material Purchasing Committee has been ordered to procure them.</p>

<p>Lu A-kui, a Ningbo native residing at No. 32 Mingyueli, Qiwupu Road, is now old. When he was in his thirties and forties, because his wife, Zhang, had not given birth to a child, he adopted a son named Songlin to continue the family line. Later, Zhang unexpectedly gave birth to a daughter, named Yuelin, whom she cherished more than anything. After she grew up, they could not bear to marry her off, so they brought in a son-in-law to live at home in order to be near to her parents. Recently, A-kui's wife passed away, and he himself is declining. His wish has been fulfilled, and his daughter is able to support herself, so he passed on the responsibility of managing the household to his children, and distributed his accumulated property equally. From then on, he could live out his remaining years in peace. But suddenly, Lu Baolin, claiming to be the real daughter of Lu A-kui and Lu Zhang, filed a lawsuit against Lu Songlin and Lu Yuelin for property division. According to her statement, her parents had two daughters, Yuelin being the elder and she being the younger. On the 23rd day of the first month of the lunar calendar in 1923, she married Hua Miaofu with her father's consent. She had gold rings, gold bracelets, gold lockets, gold necklaces, pearl flowers, and other ornaments, which were all stored with her mother. After her mother passed away, the defendants, who lived with her mother, took advantage of their proximity and not only seized the right to manage the family property but also appropriated her stored ornaments. She repeatedly asked for their return, but they always evaded. Now they are taking advantage of the fact that her elderly father is weak and cowardly, arbitrarily dividing the father's property and infringing on her due rights, which is a violation of the law. Therefore, she filed a lawsuit, asking the court to confirm that she has the right of inheritance and order the defendants to hand over all the illegally divided property and redistribute it according to law, with her and her sister each receiving two shares and Songlin receiving one share, and to return the concealed ornaments. Lu's brother and sister replied that it was fortunate that their elderly father was still alive and could easily clarify matters, so in addition to retaining lawyer Chen Tingrui to argue that their parents had longed for a daughter for a long time without success, and only then adopted Songlin to continue the family line and gave birth to Yuelin and brought in a son in law, there was no birth of the plaintiff, now the mother has passed away, the father is still alive, and relatives can also prove, the world is absolutely impossible not to recognize the daughter, that is, take a step back, if Baolin is really Yuelin's sister, then in 1929, when Songlin and Yuelin had litigation over the division of property, why not come out and claim rights, or participate in the litigation, now suddenly ask for the division of property, and demand the custody of jewelry, really do not know what is based on, if you impersonate your daughter with this unfounded thing and intend to divide the property, then there are a little more people in the future, to recognize as a biological child of the person, do not know how much more and so on, in addition, his father Lu A-kui at each first special area court opened the trial, are to the case solemnly prove that the plaintiff Lu Baolin is not his biological daughter, The case has now been investigated and concluded, and yesterday Judge Shen Hong ruled that the plaintiff's lawsuit was dismissed, and the litigation costs were borne by the plaintiff.</p>

<p>The shareholder of Xiangfeng Miscellaneous Grain Shop, Shang Zuchen, located at No. 2 Ping'an Lane, Yong'an Street, French Concession, was previously sued by Xiangmao Foreign Firm in the First Special District Court for disregarding debt. The court sent a letter to the Second Special District Court requesting assistance in investigating Shang Zuchen's shares in Xiangfeng Company. After further verification, the Second Special District Court, according to the letter, dispatched execution magistrate Cao Jun, clerk Chen Weihan, bailiff Wang Anbiao, and police officer Yuan Rongkuan No. 292 on the morning of the 6th of this month to the shop to examine the account books. Unexpectedly, the manager of the shop, Chen Jikang, and the accountant, Zhou Yixuan, firmly refused, and even verbally abused clerk Chen and other public officials, calling them robbers. Clerk Chen, finding them unreasonable, went to the Da Zimingzhong Police Station to report and request the dispatch of several police officers. Only then were Chen and Zhou taken to the Second Special District Court. After Magistrate Cao opened the court for questioning, he determined that Chen and others had committed the crime of obstructing official duty and ordered them to post bail and await transfer to the prosecutor's office for investigation and prosecution. These details were previously reported. Yesterday morning at eleven o'clock, prosecutor Wang Ren summoned Chen and Zhou to the court to open the investigation. First, police officer No. 292 and bailiff Wang Anbiao testified successively, stating that when they were ordered to go to Xiangfeng Company to examine the account books, the defendant Zhou Yixuan cursed them as robbers and refused to hand over the account books. Zhou Yixuan, when questioned, denied the verbal abuse, claiming that it was due to linguistic entanglement and requesting investigation. Chen Jikang testified that the merchants had never argued with public officials and equivocated about the rest. Prosecutor Wang, after verifying the testimonies, ordered Zhou Yixuan to provide a shop guarantee of five hundred yuan. Chen Jikang was dismissed and told to await further verification. The court then adjourned.</p>

<p>Taikoo Steamship Company's ship Chongqing, yesterday morning at the company's wharf No. 2 in the French Concession, suffered the tragedy of a Jiangnan Shipyard boiler, the breaking of a ship's mast, the death of a worker, and the dropping of the boiler into the water. The details of this incident are described below.</p>
<h3 id="e136">100,000 Sacks of Flour Shipped to Tianjin <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>The Taikoo Company's sea vessel Chongqing, 2,171 tons, was urgently shipping 100,000 sacks of flour from Shanghai to Tianjin. The ship was berthed at the company's wharf No. 2 in the French Concession for loading. At the same time, Jiangnan Dockyard had a boiler weighing 25 tons, which was also to be transported by the Chongqing ship to Tianjin for unloading. At 9 a.m. yesterday, the boiler was being loaded onto the ship at wharf No. 2 when, unexpectedly, the lifting hook's capacity was exceeded, causing the mast to break, resulting in the accident.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Crane Installation Causes Disaster <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>The boiler transported by Jiangnan Factory was huge in weight and size. It was impossible to lift the 25-ton object onto the ship by manpower alone. At 9 a.m., the workers on the barge used a winch to lower the lifting crane and secured the boiler with steel wire ropes. They immediately started lifting it onto the ship. Unexpectedly, just as the crane was lifting the boiler onto the forward deck of the Chongqing ship, it suddenly crashed into the forward mast during a turn, causing it to break due to the heavy pressure, and immediately fall down. The boiler on the crane fell into the Huangpu River.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Broken Mast Kills Worker <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>The forward mast of the Chongqing ship was made of iron, more than forty feet high, and extremely strong. At that time, the mast was broken and fell down because of the weight of the boiler on the crane. The momentum was terrible, and some of the workers on the deck were unable to escape. A temporary dock worker named Xiao Naijin was killed on the spot, and two other workers were injured, one with a crushed leg and the other with a foot injury. The boiler fell into the Huangpu River, and the mast also fell on the boat.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Damaged Freight Barge <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>When the mast fell, a civil boat named Zhao, which was carrying flour and docked outside, also suffered damage to the deck planks from the falling mast. More than forty bags of flour inside the boat were damaged. A boatman on board was also injured by the mast but fortunately his injuries were minor and not life-threatening. The two seriously injured and leg-fractured workers were sent to Renji Hospital by the dock patrol for treatment. The body of the worker who was killed was taken by the Life Saving Bureau to the morgue for inspection before being collected for burial.</p>

<p>After this tragedy occurred, the Taikoo Company urgently reported to Jesson Old Dockyard, and dispatched a large crane to Taikoo Wharf No. 2, trying to lift the broken mast. They then used a winch to lift the large boiler out of the water. However, the Chongqing ship could not stay in Shanghai for long because it was in a hurry to go to Tianjin. The company agreed with Jesson to install a temporary mast base first, so that it could go abroad in time. The Chongqing ship has been scheduled to enter the yard this morning to rush the installation of the mast.</p>

At present, it is only temporarily repaired.</p>

<p>The troupe initially planned to leave Shanghai for India on the 6th of next month, but then received a telegram from Haikinbo stating that they had to arrive before Christmas, so the date of departure from Shanghai must be brought forward by several days. The head of the troupe negotiated with the Henry Bao Company and planned to leave Shanghai three days earlier than scheduled, with a freight of 63,000 gold marks.</p>

<p>The Henry Bao Company originally sent the Saran Wheel on December 6 to carry the troupe to India. Because it was leaving three days earlier, the Henry Bao Company has agreed to a special accommodation. It sent a telegram from Shanghai to the Saran Wheel en route, ordering it not to go to Little Luzon or stop at Qingdao Port. The goods at these two places were rerouted to Hong Kong and Shanghai, so that the entire troupe of people and animals could leave Shanghai three days earlier on December 3 and go to Gergoda.</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon, a large group of pirates were discovered in the waters near Huanglong Island outside Songkou, abducting ten fishing boats belonging to fishermen Zou Aqi, Jiang Linsheng, Xu Abao, Qiu Zhenqing, Zhou Ashun, etc., and kidnapping more than 40 crew members. It is reported that the leader of the pirates is named Xiang Baorong. The Haihong patrol ship went to pursue them, but no trace of the pirates was found. This morning, it continued to patrol the waters of Sijiao and Shenshan, and warned all merchant ships to pay attention to the type of pirate ship, which is a large Fujian three-masted fishing boat. If any ship encounters a suspicious ship at sea, it should quickly avoid it and report it to the nearby water police or navy, who can immediately pursue it.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Concession Chinese Taxpayers Association sent a letter to the Shanghai Public Concession Works Bureau yesterday, stating, "According to the taxpayer Dai Shengding's letter on November 18, the rent for the dwelling is 21 yuan per month, but the Works Bureau's donation office forcibly increased the estimated housing price by 50% this winter compared to the previous period, demanding a donation of 12 yuan and 6 jiao. This was previously reported in a letter on October 7. According to the donation office, Mr. Yao went to the Nanjing Automobile Company where I work on October 21 to conduct a thorough investigation, and took away a housing ticket for May of this year to verify with the landlord Hong Futang, and then corrected the donation ticket. It has been many days since then, but it has not been done. I have repeatedly inquired by telephone about Mr. Yao's progress, but there has been no result. Recently, on the 13th of this month, a collector came to my office again, coercing and demanding donations unsuccessfully. I only agreed to pay 8 yuan and 8 jiao and 2 fen according to your association's letter of October 11, and then left unhappily. Who knows that he came to my office again this morning, saying that if I do not pay the estimated donation of 12 yuan and 6 jiao today, they will seal the door. It is said that in such a situation, where is the qualification of being a public official? Although taxpayers are weak, they are willing to sacrifice individually, but even if this precedent is set, it will disrupt the overall situation, so that their attempt can gain an inch. For this reason, I have no choice but to express my feelings and ask your association to毅力主持向七部局捐務感交涉, and for the sake of the people's livelihood, maintain public convenience. According to the investigation, collecting municipal donations based on actual rent is already a disadvantage for tenants compared to landlords, because the estimated value of land is much less than the market price, but rent is not. However, this association believes that in terms of law and fairness, the collection of municipal donations..."</p>

<p>Xing Zhonghe, the owner of Yonghecheng Silk Shop at 529 Tianjin Road, was formerly the manager of Yuhecheng Silk Shop. The shop was relatively large and had many affiliated shops. Later, these affiliated shops owed more than 300,000 yuan to the industry, such as Cai Renbao, the manager of Hengshenggong Silk Shop on Tianjin Road, and Zhang Zhuping, the manager of Yifengchang Silk Shop on Jiangxi Road, who were both creditors and had demanded the debt from Xing Zhonghe, causing mutual suspicion. Xing was treacherous and secretly applied</p>
<h3 id="e151">Cunning Tricks <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>To destroy the reputation of Hengshenggong and Yifengchang, in order to vent his anger. Cai et al did not initially care, but Xing then stepped forward, becoming more evil, and in late July, fabricated a telegram in the name of Wang Shuchang at 98 Baxianfang, Baxianqiao, Shanghai, to the Shandong Qingzhou Silk Industry Protection Committee in Linqu, stating that Heng and Yi's two shops owed the bank too much money, and it was decided to implement withholding of goods for compensation, otherwise, it would be auctioned, and if it was not enough, it would be sued, etc. Xing telegraphed all the areas in Lu province that produced yellow and white silk. The silk merchants in the province did not initially know that the telegram was forged, so they all</p>

<p>Silk goods for the two silk shops to sell on consignment, and Xing immediately canvassed the silk merchants to sell on consignment on his behalf. This false propaganda could not only harm others but also benefit himself, and was considered a supreme strategy. Later, a resident employee of Hengshenggong in Lu learned about it, and immediately telegraphed the Shanghai branch to go to the telegraph office to investigate who sent the telegram. However, according to the telegraph office's regulations, checking the telegram was not possible unless it was the sender or receiver. The resident employee was ordered to bring the telegram received there</p>
<h3 id="e153">To Shanghai for Investigation <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>As a result, the handwriting on the forged telegram manuscript was the same as the handwriting on the telegram manuscripts sent by Yonghecheng on weekdays. Moreover, because Xing sent many telegrams, one of them was undeliverable and returned to Shanghai. The telegram was returned to Baxianfang, Baxianqiao, but there was no Wang Shuchang, so it was left in the telegraph office. However, Yuan Zhaoru, the clerk of the telegraph office who received the forged telegram, could recognize the tea house servant who delivered the forged telegram as Wang Youfu, a tea house servant of Yonghecheng. Therefore, the next day when Wang sent another telegram to the office, he asked if the previous telegram was sent by him, and asked what the telephone number of Yonghecheng was. The tea house servant immediately admitted it and answered</p>
<h3 id="e154">Telephone Number <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Yuan immediately wrote the telephone number on the original copy of the forged telegram. Later, Zhang Zhuping and others went to the telegraph office to find out that the defendant had the above suspicion, and reported it to the police. The police immediately sent detectives to the telegraph office to investigate, believing that the evidence was conclusive. However, for the sake of caution, they wanted to order Yuan Zhaoru to identify him. They opened a room in the Nanjing Hotel, and a Chinese detective went to the entrance of Yonghecheng to wait for Wang Youfu. When Wang came out, he falsely claimed that a fellow villager had been separated for a long time, and now a friend was waiting in Nanjing, and there were still things to be sent. Wang thought it was a long-separated friend that he had forgotten, so he followed</p>

<p>After Yuan saw him, Yuan said that he would report back to the director. At that time, he did not say whether he was the tea house servant who sent the forged telegram, so he could not send him to the police station on the spot. Later, the Chinese detective watched around Wang, and the gatekeeper patrolman near Yonghecheng saw it and asked what was happening near Yonghecheng. The Chinese detective watched around, and Xing knew about it and ordered Wang Youfu to leave Shanghai. However, although Wang left Shanghai, the physical evidence was still there, so Cai and Zhang hired lawyers Sun Yuan et al. and filed</p>

<p>A criminal self-accusation in the First Special District Court, requesting to be punished according to the law. After repeated summons by the court to both parties and telegram office staff to hang the original manuscript, the trial concluded that the defendant was guilty. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Liu Gui opened the court and sentenced Xing Zhonghe (ie Xing Zhonghe) to instigate the use of forged documents to three months of imprisonment, with a three-year reprieve. The defendant shall publish the main text of this judgment in the newspaper and bear the costs. However, Xing had filed a counterclaim against Cai and Zhang at that time. This counterclaim part was also sentenced at the same time yesterday afternoon. Cai Renbao and Zhang Zhuping were both acquitted.</p>
<p>It is absolutely inappropriate not to base it on the actual rent, and the case of your bureau suing a certain number on Shanxi Road has also become a very good precedent in law, and both public and private should abide by it. If your bureau cannot prove that Dai Shengding's rent is indeed not real and obtains a court judgment, you must not destroy the foundation of the rule of law. As for Mr. Yao's delay in investigation and the collector's intimidation, if it is true, they should be punished. Accordingly, a letter is sent requesting investigation and handling.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Fiji to Ban Import of Chinese Ham, Plans to Formulate Meat Import Regulations, Chinese Ham Merchants to Suffer Greatly <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>When Wen Jiang and others of the Philippine Industrial Inspection Group came to Shanghai this spring, the local International Trade Bureau and Commodity Inspection Bureau successively received them and led them to visit various industrial factories, hoping that trade between China and Fiji could be increased after the group returned home. Unexpectedly, after the group returned home, they considered that major commodities exported from our country to Fiji, such as ham, were manufactured in an unsanitary manner, and suggested that the government ban the import of our country's ham. After repeated negotiations by our consul-general in Manila, Yun Guanglin, no effect was seen, and it was learned that the local health bureau had drafted meat import regulations and submitted them to the Fiji governor for approval. If these regulations are implemented, our country's ham industry to Fiji will inevitably be greatly affected. The following is the transcript of the report of the Consul-General to Manila, Li Guanglin, on this matter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to illustrate the exclusion of Chinese goods. I have investigated that meat products made in our country are sold to Fiji Island, amounting to 1.1 million pesos (Dutch currency) annually, accounting for more than one-tenth of the imported goods. American merchants and the Fiji government have long regarded this as a major loophole and have always wanted to restrict it. Such as the council repeatedly proposing tax increase bills and the health bureau pointing out poor manufacturing methods, are all caused by this. However, because this kind of food is favored by Chinese and Fiji people and the price is cheaper than American goods and local exports, it has been able to maintain sales. The Fiji government advocates restricting the import of Chinese ham and meat products, because the director of the health bureau, Fuhart, former director of the livestock bureau, Yang Bai, and director of the livestock bureau, Pu Kemi, Pu Kemi also has a large investment in the local meat industry, and he holds it especially firmly. In April of this year, Fuhart, Yang Bailuti, went to Shanghai and other places to inspect the equipment of our country's ham and meat production. After returning to Fiji, they cited that the manufacturing method was unsanitary and feared hindering people's health, and asked the Fiji governor to order a ban on imports from 1934. Those shipped this year are limited to no more than 50,000 pieces from the Shanghai Chinese Ham Company, and no more than 500 pieces from L. Adams Ce. After the official met with the Fiji Governor's Health Advisor Denham and the members of the House of Representatives Wen Jiang and Lunna, who went to China in March of this year to inspect business, explained that this ham and meat had been eaten by Fiji people for a long time and had no hindrance to health. Stopping the import and reducing tariffs would be harmful. The advisor and others expressed sympathy. Later, the Governor also considered that it would hinder the freedom of Sino-Fiji trade and did not agree. In fact, the government relies on this meat to collect import duties, as well as direct and indirect business taxes, amounting to 400,000 pesos per year. Once the import is banned, it will be replaced by tax-free American goods. At a time when the Fiji government is facing financial difficulties, it is especially unwilling to give it up. Now the director of the health bureau, Fuhart, follows the authorities' intentions and plans to formulate a meat import regulation and submit it to the Fiji governor for approval. This example is based on the German method of dealing with the United States in those years, (according to the years 1896, Germany once banned American ham from entering the country, and later the United States allowed it to be manufactured according to its regulations before it was restored,) In Fiji, apart from those from the United States and Australia, Chinese goods are the most imported ham and meat, and it is obvious that it is set up for our country. The drafting of this regulation is intended by the authorities, and it seems to be imperative. This regulation is very detailed on the procedures for manufacturing ham and meat, and is in line with hygiene principles. With the current equipment of our country's companies, it seems not difficult to improve, but its use as a standard for domestic products is allowed as a way for the government to pay attention to hygiene, as the regulations that should be followed when manufacturing imported goods, not without Yue Zu official. I also met with consultant Denham and told him that our country is willing to improve the manufacturing method of ham and meat in order to increase foreign sales. This example is quite valuable and will be presented for reference. If there are any improvements better than our country, we will be happy to adopt them. However, whether our country accepts it or not, sufficient time should be given in advance for detailed study. The consultant agreed with this point. The equipment of the Fiji factory is far inferior to our country, and the output is not much and the quality is also inferior, but it is now engaged in improvement and progress is very rapid. At present, the Fiji government has formulated a good manufacturing method, and it seems that it should be adopted, otherwise, even if it is not prohibited from being imported because it does not comply with the manufacturing, Fiji goods may also encroach on sales. This matter concerns an important business case, and it is reasonable to copy four copies of the draft regulations and present them to you for your review, and ask to forward them to the Ministry of Industry, issue them to the International Trade Bureau, and conduct a commodity inspection to avoid them. Please indicate how to handle it. Respectfully presented to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Consul-General to Manila, Kuang Guanglin.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Urges Paper Industry to Purchase Yellow Hollyhock for Papermaking to Rescue Collapsing Rural Economy <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday sent a letter to the Paper Industry Guild, stating: "Dear Sirs, We received a letter on the 21st of this month from the Nanhui County Government, forwarded from Zhang Bangjie, District Chief of the Sixth District of your county, who presented a report from Hu Pinchun, Township Head of Zhu Dian Township, stating: 'Farmers in various townships of this district, recognizing the consecutive years of poor harvests and low prices of cotton, rice, and wheat, are now switching to planting yellow hollyhock, as it is more profitable. They eagerly sought seeds priced at three yuan per catty and followed suit in planting this spring. Furthermore, Mr. Tianxu Wo Sheng from Shanghai wrote a leaflet, distributed by Ding Zhen Dong from Chuansha, promoting planting to remedy the agricultural situation. The planting methods, uses, and sales channels were explained in detail, taking its roots as a raw material for papermaking. Factories in Shanghai have a substantial annual demand. Upon harvest, the farmers in this district approached various paper mills for sales, but were met with claims of market saturation and refusal to purchase. Whether still in the fields or already harvested and piled up, the yellow hollyhock is vulnerable to frost and sun, leading to rot and becoming useless. The farmers are in panic, and the Township Head, witnessing this situation, believes that the rural economy is on the verge of collapse. If no measures are taken to remedy this, the farmers will suffer even more, which concerns the national economy and the people's livelihood. Therefore, we are writing to the County Government, requesting them to consult with paper mills and related organizations in Shanghai to urgently purchase the yellow hollyhock as much as possible to benefit the farmers' livelihoods, etc.' Based on this, in addition to the order, we are correspondingly requesting your esteemed association to investigate and instruct the paper mills to purchase as much as possible to rescue the collapsing rural economy. It is said that yellow hollyhock is a raw material for papermaking adhesive, and Shanghai factories have a substantial annual demand. There have been reports of prominent figures in the papermaking industry promoting planting. The farmers of Nanhui have actively responded. If they are refused purchase, it would be a waste of resources and further hasten rural bankruptcy. We are accordingly requesting your esteemed association to earnestly persuade member paper mills to raise funds and purchase as much as possible to maintain the livelihoods of the farmers and prevent them from abandoning their profession. This is also to prevent a shortage of raw materials next year, which would indirectly benefit the operations of the factories. We urge you to sincerely persuade them and report the handling situation for further communication. This is our earnest request."</p>

<h3 id="e159">Operating Methods of China Economic Credit Cooperative Society Differ from Ordinary Commercial and Financial Industries - Members Can Manage Funds and Review Investments - Society Funds Will Be Increased to 500,000 Yuan in Installments <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>The China Economic Credit Cooperative Society at 455 Hankou Road in this city has been well-received by the public since its opening. However, many outside parties do not understand its operating methods. A gentleman made a special inquiry and learned the general outline: (1) Characteristics of Economic Cooperation: Economic cooperation has two characteristics: First, using the mutual assistance of the public to exchange the greatest benefits at the least cost. Second, the principle is to trust oneself and manage and use funds independently. Ordinary financial industries do not use capital to pay interest or claims. For example, the interest paid by banks to depositors is only the income from the use of their deposits. Other examples include the death benefits paid by insurance companies, which are only jointly borne by the insured. In fact, they are all examples of cooperation and mutual assistance by making good use of deposits and insurance. In addition to paying interest and claims, ordinary financial industries also have huge profits. Cooperative societies allow members to directly enjoy this type of profit. In other words, members share the greatest benefits because of mutual assistance. The most important part of financial institutions is the management of funds and investment review. Depositors cannot intervene in this process. Recognizing this, the Society has established a Fund Management Committee and an Investment Review Committee to execute supervision and review investment funds. In addition to the Chairman and General Manager of the Society serving as natural committee members, the majority of the members of these two committees are selected from among the members of the Society. Members account for an absolute majority and have the power to manage and review without bearing the responsibility for business losses. This is unmatched by any financial institution. (2) The Use and Increase of the Society's Funds: The characteristics of economic cooperation are such that the Society's funds are used for expenses and guarantees. The use of the Society's funds is also based on this, rather than seeking huge profits like commercial and financial industries, or consolidating the faith of depositors. Since the use of the Society's funds is for (1) expenses and (2) guarantees, a huge amount of capital is not required in the first phase. It is only necessary for the Society's funds to cover expenses and for the total amount of the Society's funds to be sufficient for guarantees. From now on, the Society's expenses will be maintained with the Society's fund income. The estimated number of Society members in the first phase is 5,000 shares, so the 100,000 yuan liability of the first phase of the Society's funds is sufficient for guarantee. From then on, for every 1,000 shares increased, the liability increases by 5,000 yuan until it reaches 500,000 yuan. (3) The Society's Funds and the Role of Capital in Commercial and Financial Industries Are Different: The Society is different from ordinary businesses. Ordinary businesses use capital to seek huge profits, and these profits come from customers. The Society's core members do not seek this kind of benefit. The Society is also different from the financial industry. The financial industry must have a large amount of capital to consolidate the faith of depositors. Since the Society is managed independently by members, this is not necessary. Comparing safety, the Society's members are better than bank depositors. Any general bank's capital is not proportional to the deposits it absorbs. A bank with 5 million yuan of capital often has over 50 million yuan in deposits. The guarantee obtained by depositors is only one-tenth in terms of capital ratio. It is ultimately not as safe as the Society's members being able to manage it themselves. (4) The Guarantee Responsibility of the Society's Core Members: In addition to contributing capital, the Society's core members must also bear a guarantee responsibility. If the person dies or the business fails midway, they cannot be held responsible. Recognizing this, the Society will pay the savings life fund for those who should have received six percent dividends. Even if the person dies or becomes unemployed midway, there is no need to worry. (5) The Handling of Members' Savings and the Benefits Enjoyed: One might ask where the generous benefits enjoyed by the Society's members come from and how the savings turned over by the Society's members are handled. Originally, the Society took one-tenth of the members' savings to use for members' dormitories, reception rooms, entertainment rooms, reading rooms, employment agencies, and various consultant guidance committees. The remaining nine-tenths were turned over to the Fund Management Committee every afternoon for management, and the Investment Review Committee carefully invested it. The income was used to guarantee the payment of members' bonuses, claims, and principal and interest. If there are not enough, the Society's funds will be allocated. If it is still not enough to pay, it is guaranteed by the guarantee amount. (6) The Relationship Between the Society and Members Can Be Determined Independently: The relationship between the Society's members and the Society can be chosen by the members. In order to enable members to join shares for free in the future, all those who join the Society as members can allocate the dividends they should receive to pay for share subscriptions (those who do not wish to do so may listen). Therefore, anyone who joins the Society not only enjoys life insurance, savings, bonuses, loans, entertainment, and mutual assistance benefits, but also becomes a member of the Society after a considerable number of years, jointly bearing the responsibility for management.</p>

Everyone will purchase at least a few tickets to try their luck. It is reported that the last special prize and second prize were sold as split tickets, and the winners come from all walks of life. According to inquiries, the special prize number 289779 was sold as a split ticket by the Zhengtong Bank in the Beiping distribution office. A tea servant named Yao from the Military Branch won a ticket. The tea servant, who was impoverished, suddenly won a huge prize of 50,000 yuan. It is no wonder he was overjoyed and could not sleep for three days. It is also reported that a staff member surnamed Yang from the Central Trust of China won two tickets, and a gentleman from the Salt Bank also won one ticket. There was also a peddler and two workers who jointly purchased a ticket. The peddler contributed a foreign coin, and the two workers each contributed three dimes. They have worked hard all their lives and have little hope of accumulating thousands of dollars. Now, at the cost of a few dimes, they have won more than ten thousand yuan, which is beyond their wildest dreams. This shows that luck comes regardless of poverty. Just don't miss the opportunity. There are a total of two second prizes. It is reported that one of the numbers was sold as a split ticket in the capital distribution office. A staff member from the General Affairs Section of the Jinpu Railway Bureau won two tickets. Also, five women jointly purchased a ticket. One of them was pregnant and about to give birth. When purchasing the ticket, she stated that if she won the prize, she would use it for her children's education expenses. Now her wish has been fulfilled. There was also a purchase of a wool sweater for a full ten yuan, and they received a free ticket, which also won the second prize. It is reported that this was won by a senior official of a certain high-level agency in Beijing. It is truly fortunate. The Aviation Lottery has many prizes, and the prize money is huge. One out of ten tickets is guaranteed to win a prize. It is reported that the third phase has already been issued and is still a split-ticket method. It is approved to draw the prizes publicly at the Yiyuan Garden in Shanghai before the Lunar New Year. Purchasers are very enthusiastic. It is unknown who the lucky one will be.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Two Railway Business Offices Will Open Branches - One in the Capital and One in the Southern City - Methane Gas Cars Will Be Used to Transport Packages <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Since the opening of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Business Offices, various services have been launched one after another, and business has progressed rapidly. Since the recent commencement of cargo delivery, major factories and businesses have competed to entrust them with handling, almost to the point of being overwhelmed. Huang Boqiao, Director of the Two Railway Administrations, believes that the Shanghai Business Office's three-month trial run has been effective, and has specifically instructed the Traffic Department to rush to establish two branch offices in Nanjing and Nanshi, and to prepare a newly invented methane gas car to cheaply deliver packages, striving to serve the community. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e165">Development of Freight Business <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Since the office began handling cargo delivery on the 20th of this month, due to the low prices and prompt service, major factories and businesses have entrusted the office with handling. Other requests for handling procedures and calculation of freight rates are even more numerous. In three days, the amount of cargo transported has reached about 200 tons. The future is very promising. All sectors can contact and notify them by telephone at any time (35850).</p>
<h3 id="e166">Two Branches Will Be Established Immediately <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>The original plan of the Two Railway Business Offices was to first conduct a trial run in Shanghai. In the future, branch offices would be established successively along the line in various places, such as Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Wuxi, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Ningbo, etc. Currently, the trial run of the Shanghai Business Office has achieved excellent results. Director Huang Boqiao believes that this business urgently needs to be promoted, and has specifically instructed the Traffic Department to rush to establish offices in Nanjing and Nanshi in the city to meet social needs. After receiving the order, the Traffic Department has selected the area near the World Grand Theatre on Taiping Road in Nanjing as the location for the Nanjing Business Office, and rented a store front opposite the Ning Shao Wharf at 16 Pu in Nanshi in the city as the address for the Nanshi office. It is expected that both locations will be able to start providing services in early next month, focusing on freight development.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Methane Gas Cars Transport Packages <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>Xiang, a technician from the Hunan Provincial Construction Department, invented the charcoal gas car. Its trial run has been quite successful, and using charcoal instead of oil has low costs, saving a huge amount of gasoline leakage each year. Hunan, Sichuan, Hubei, and other provinces have adopted it one after another. However, it is not yet popular in Shanghai. Now, the Two Railway Administrations, in order to actively promote it, have specially rented one of these cars for the Business Office to deliver packages for customers, charging only one dime per 60 kilograms, with no minimum freight charge (the original minimum freight charge of 1.50 yuan has been cancelled). This low freight and handling fee is completely to reduce the burden on customers and is completely different from those who seek profit.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Datong Steamer Sinks Yejiche Steamer <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>The British Taikoo Company's Yangtze River Datong Steamer arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 1 p.m. It first docked at the company's pier in the French Concession to unload cargo. At 4 p.m., it sailed again to the company's pier north of Laiyi Ferry in Pudong to dock. As it was approaching the outside of the Hongshengzhan pier in Pudong and turning around to dock alongside, a Yejiche (not a fixed full-time professional) small steamer, Hengdaxing, towing two wharf boats, was sailing from the south. Because the stern of the Datong Steamer turned too quickly, the small steamer could not avoid it and was suddenly struck violently. The small steamer could not withstand it, tilted and took on water, sinking to the bottom of the river. It is reported that three people were rescued on the spot. As for whether anyone drowned in the river with the boat, it will be investigated and reported later. Fortunately, the wharf boat towed behind immediately cut the mooring rope, so it did not encounter danger.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Wet Nurse, Resenting Termination of Employment, Feeds Child Needles; Case Continues Trial; Police Prosecute for Attempted Murder; Defense Lawyer Presents Three Points of Suspicion <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Wu Xiaoke, a native of Fujian, courtesy name Ruichai, residing at No. 5 Xuehuali Road in the French Concession, currently a civil judge in the Second Special District Court, and his wife had a daughter, named Xiaomeimei, in May of this year in the lunar calendar. Recently, due to insufficient breast milk, they hired Chen Tang, a young woman from Yangzhou (26 years old this year), through the Xinji Li Matchmaker Agency at the intersection of Ximen Malang Road as a wet nurse on the 10th of last month. After a successful trial, a monthly salary of nine yuan was agreed upon and two months' salary was prepaid. However, not long after starting work, she suddenly requested leave to go out and play, but the owner refused because the child needed to be breastfed every day. She became unhappy and suddenly showed her explosive temper, often beating the child. Until the 10th of this month, Wu's wife saw Tang beating the child, so she was dismissed immediately and ordered to return the prepaid salary for one month. The matchmaker was told to take her away and another wet nurse was hired. Unexpectedly, Tang resented this and secretly fed the child three lead-wire iron needles, in an attempt to vent her anger. After swallowing the needles, the child suddenly fell ill and cried non-stop. The parents did not understand, so they sent the child to the hospital for treatment. After examination by the doctor, the cause of the illness was also unclear, so they took the child back and extended the treatment to a pediatrician, Xu Xiaopu. At noon on the 12th, when the child urinated, Wu's wife and another wet nurse discovered one bent iron needle each at the child's anus. Only then did they realize that Tang had plotted and used this vicious method. They reported it to the French police. Detective Peng Shitian went to investigate and personally took out a lead-wire needle from the child's anus and arrested Tang. During interrogation, she admitted without hesitation that she had fed the child the needles while breastfeeding. The next day, when she was escorted to the Second Special District Court for a hearing, she cunningly denied it again. She was ordered to be detained pending further investigation. The details have been recorded in previous newspapers. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhang Chaozuo presided over the continued hearing in Criminal Court No. 1. First, the police lawyer Fei Xizhen stated the police investigation process and prosecuted her for attempted murder under Article 284 of the Criminal Law. The plaintiff did not arrive. When questioned, the defendant Chen Tang continued to cunningly deny it. Then, Yu Zhongluo, the lawyer appointed by the court to defend the defendant, stood up and expressed his opinion, stating that there were three points of suspicion in this case: (1) The child defecates every day. Why was it only after two days that the needles were swallowed and discovered in the stool? (2) According to the report, the defendant put the needle on the nipple and fed it to the child. According to the detective's report, the defendant first put the needle in the child's mouth and then fed it during breastfeeding. (3) Since the defendant has been dismissed and is not allowed to take care of the child, she has already left the child. How could she have the opportunity to poison her again? According to these three points of suspicion, the court should conduct a detailed investigation, etc. After verifying the words, the court ordered that the hearing be adjourned to the 27th. The defendant was still detained.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Opening of the Trial for the Fourth Fire at Jiu'antang Chinese Medicine Store - Police Prosecute for Endangering Public Safety - However, There Are Rumors That a Fox Spirit Is Haunting the Store <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>Wei Jiuan, a native of Yangzhou, took over the business of Jiuantang Chinese Medicine Store at Nos. 573 to 575 Malang Road in the French Concession three months ago, with fire insurance of 5,000 yuan. At the beginning of the opening, the business was quite good, with an income of 200 to 300 yuan per day. Soon, it gradually became sluggish. On the evenings of the 21st and 29th of last month, and the 4th and 12th of this month, fires broke out and burned four times in a row. Fortunately, they were discovered in time and extinguished by themselves, without causing a major disaster. After the second fire, the police summoned the case and ordered a fine of 10 yuan as a warning for negligence. However, after the fine, two more fires broke out. The police found that the store had been losing money recently, and there was suspicion of arson to claim insurance. Also, because the store owner Wei Jiuan and his wife were not in the store when the fires broke out, and the clerk Dou Guangyuan also avoided staying at the Juying Hotel on Ailai Ge Road, the suspicion deepened. Therefore, Detective Hong Chunxiang was dispatched to arrest Wei Jiuan, Wei Jiang, his wife, and the clerk Dou Guangyuan, and escort them to the Second Special District Court for prosecution and interrogation. The details have been briefly recorded in previous newspapers. The police had already summoned the informant, the second landlord Qian Heling (the former owner of the Jiuantang Pharmacy, who lives upstairs in the store with Wei as a fellow villager), and neighbors Fei Huanwen, Ye Yunsong, Wang Songju, Bao Mingju, etc., and completed the investigation. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhang Chaozuo presided over the continued hearing in Criminal Court No. 1. The police lawyer Fei Xizhen stated the police investigation process and prosecuted them for endangering public safety under Article 187, Paragraph 4 of the Criminal Law. When questioned, the defendants all denied arson. The official ordered them to wait for another hearing. Recently, it was rumored that the fires at the store were caused by a fox spirit. Since Wei and others were detained, there have been two more fires, but they were all fleeting and were immediately extinguished. Strange things have also happened before, such as medicine scales placed in the drawer suddenly disappearing the next day when the store opened. They could not be found, so they temporarily borrowed them from others to use and put them back in the drawer. The scale weight suddenly disappeared four times and was finally found. The scale beam suddenly broke into three sections. The actual situation is unknown to outsiders. Now that the court has accepted the case, it should be thoroughly investigated to clarify the truth.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Qin Yindog Commits Suicide Due to Poverty <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Qin Yindog, a native of Chongming, 45 years old, lived at No. 45 Caopeng Wujiabang, Qiuzhen, North Shanghai, and made a living by growing vegetables. He had an elderly mother, wife, brother, a 13-year-old daughter, and an 11-year-old son, a family of six. They relied entirely on growing vegetables, which was not enough, causing him to sit in sorrow and despair, and he developed a world-weary thought. At 7 a.m. the day before yesterday, his wife Qin Zhang had not yet gotten up, while Yindog alone hanged himself in the empty room outside. When his wife got up and discovered him, he was already cold. The neighbors were informed, and the police learned of it and immediately reported to the Fifth District Third Branch Office. Inspector Lin Jing personally went to investigate. According to the deceased's wife, Qin Zhang, her husband had no grudges, but the reason for his hanging was that a family of several people had no money to buy rice, go home to cook, and could not make a living. He must have hanged himself in a moment of resentment, etc. He immediately returned to the office to report to the head office and forwarded it to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for review. At the same time, he ordered the local security to report to the court and request an examination.</p>

<p>Zhuang Jinming, a native of Suzhou, falsely established a business called Guotai Trading Company at No. 4 Aiwenyi Road between August and September, colluding with Jin Keming, Gong Dachen, Zhao Xingfu, etc., to defraud various merchants of cosmetics worth a considerable amount, and ordered 397 dozen large and small bottles worth 2,106 yuan and 60 cents from the Guohua Thermos Factory at No. 6 Wuchang Road, and shipped them successively. He used a 1,000 yuan check from the Zikang Money Shop, which had no savings, to pay the factory on September 21, and then abandoned the shop and fled. He was reported to the New Shantou Police Station. Subsequently, detectives apprehended the accomplices Gong and Zhao and escorted them to the First Special District Court, where they were found guilty and sentenced to imprisonment. The day before yesterday, Huitan Police Station Chinese Detective Sun Aizhong apprehended Zhuang Jinming in Room 14 of the Qinghe Hotel in Qinghefang, Zhejiang Road. Yesterday morning, he was escorted by Criminal Court No. 3. The police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated the case and said that the two names, Gong and Zhao, who had been found guilty, had confessed that the defendant was one of the shareholders of the store, and that the business had been founded by opening a checking account at Zikang Money Shop with only 200 yuan. A checkbook was obtained. After several days, 192 yuan was withdrawn, leaving only 8 yuan. Later, the defendants issued postdated checks and defrauded loans from various places. Shen Heying, the former manager of the Guohua Factory, saw the Gold Crane thermos bottles made by his factory at the Hongshunchang Department Store at No. 1360 Robert Road, so he asked how much each bottle was sold for. He was told that half a dozen bottles cost 10 yuan and 80 cents. Shen was shocked because the wholesale price of his factory for half a dozen bottles was at least 14 yuan and 40 cents. He asked who they were purchased from and learned that they were sold by Lu Lianqing, a broker from Guotai. Only then did he realize that the shop was unreliable. He immediately returned to the factory and rushed to Zikang Money Shop to investigate the 1,000 yuan check given by Guotai. He was told that the shop only had 8 yuan. He then reported it to the police. Until yesterday, the defendant was apprehended. Now, he requested a postponement to thoroughly investigate other similar cases of fraud. Then, Shen Junying testified about the process. When questioned, the defendant's confession was evasive. Judge Liu Yugui ordered him to be detained and the hearing to be postponed for further verification.</p>

<p>Ren Xianglin, a native of Ningbo, colluded with Li Zhongyun and Wang Guangrong, ticket sellers at the Haijingbo Circus, on the 10th of this month to forge 1-yuan and 2-yuan admission tickets from the Fuxing Printing Workshop on Zhonghua Road in the Southern City, and mixed them in for sale to divide the money for use. The case was exposed and detectives Wang Yongjun and Bao Zhu Shanghe from the Jingansi Police Station arrested Li, Wang, and Ren. They went to the Fuxing Printing Workshop in the Southern City and arrested the owner's wife, Li Liu, and the shop assistant Yao Jiqing, along with the forged ticket money, and escorted them to the First Special District Court for interrogation.

<p>Zhou Changqing of Yancheng, Jiangbei, had a son named Zhou Xiaosan, now twenty-four years old. Because his elder brother had no heir, Xiaosan was to inherit the lineage of both his uncle's and his father's lines. Zhou Changqing's elder brother, during his lifetime, lived at No. 66 Guangzhao Road in Zhabei, specializing in lending money at high interest. He had accumulated some savings. After his death, his wife Zhou Chen (Xiaosan's stepmother), now over seventy years old, continued to engage in the lucrative business of lending money. In a few years, she amassed a considerable fortune. Because she did not recognize Xiaosan as her heir, a lawsuit was filed in the local court. After Changqing died the year before last, Xiaosan, resenting his stepmother's refusal to allow him to inherit the estate, conceived a murderous plan. On August 4th of this year, he hid a kitchen knife on his person. While his stepmother Zhou Chen was washing a chamber pot by the Suzhou Creek at Youdaijiao, he attacked her head with the knife, inflicting three severe wounds. She died in the hospital. Xiaosan fled and disappeared. Three months passed. Zhou Chen's younger brother, Chen Xueshi, happened to go to Wuxi on business. While watching a play in a theater, he spotted Xiaosan in the audience. He remained calm and secretly reported this to the captain of the local water patrol, who dispatched police to arrest Xiaosan. He was handed over to the Wuxi County government for detention. Yesterday, Chen Xueshi came to Shanghai to petition the local court, requesting an official document be issued to send police to Wuxi to escort the suspect back for interrogation and trial.</p>

<p>At approximately 7:30 PM the night before last, sparks from the embroidery frame room of the Sanyang Cotton Knitting Factory on Kangding Road in western Shanghai suddenly landed in the waste cotton room next door. Instantly, thick smoke filled the air, bursting through the roof. The Sixth District patrol police reported to the Caojiadu Fire Brigade, which dispatched vehicles to the scene and vigorously poured water to extinguish the fire. The blaze was finally put out. One large door of the waste cotton room was destroyed, with estimated losses amounting to around eight hundred taels. The Sixth District dispatched police to investigate the cause of the fire and detained Sun Jixin, the factory accountant. After questioning by district officials, he was transferred to the bureau for further investigation. It is said that the waste cotton room was constructed of reed mats, making it susceptible to fire. Moreover, the only small lane behind the factory was blocked, creating a situation where residents of the workshops behind the factory nearly had no way to escape when the fire broke out. The cries of terror shook the heavens.</p>

<p>Zhang Yongming, a native of Tongzhou, was already fifty years old. His wife was of similar age. Their only son, Zhang Longhai, was eighteen years old. Through a friend's introduction, he came to Shanghai and worked at Zhang Shengji Motor Garage on Xinmin Road in Zhabei. His monthly salary was thirty yuan. He was diligent and conscientious in his work and was well-trusted by the shop owner. However, at 10 AM the day before yesterday, he went out on business and met his uncle, Zhang Shibao, on Xinmin Road. While they were standing on the roadside talking, a truck owned by Tian Yaoji, driven by Ren Shijie, sped past from east to west, hitting Zhang Longhai. He fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. The driver, knowing he had caused an accident, sped up to escape. Passersby Shi Jucheng and Chen Linshan, witnessing the scene, collaborated with Zhang Shibao to alert the police, who intercepted the truck and brought the driver to the station. Zhang Longhai was rushed to the hospital for treatment, but succumbed to his injuries. The local bailiff reported the death to the court for a coroner's examination. The police conducted an investigation. Given the seriousness of the case and reports that Ren Shijie violated police regulations and neglected his duty, causing the accident, an official document was prepared to hand over the suspect to the court for legal proceedings.</p>

<p>The Security Door Viewer that Has Created a Sensation Throughout Shanghai: The domestic Security Door Viewer issued by the Security Door Viewer Company at 551 Nanjing Road, Continental Emporium, was invented by industrialists Sang Yutang and Yu Jiesheng. The mirror is placed on the door, allowing a clear view of everything outside the door from the inside. Even if someone is hidden in the corner, they cannot escape detection. However, those outside cannot see anything inside. The viewer prevents burglars, swindlers, and robberies, and avoids unnecessary social engagements. Since its introduction just a week ago, it has created a sensation throughout Shanghai. Not only have mansions and residences, such as those of Huang Jinrong, Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, Fang Jiaobo, Chen Zhaqing, Yang Xiaotian, Lu Wenshao, Lu Ying, Jiang Yiping, Yan Duhe, Xi Yushu, Zheng Chengqing, and Gu Zhuxuan, already installed them, but also banks such as the Silk Industry Bank and the Women's Bank have successively installed them. Furthermore, law offices, doctors' surgeries, shop accounting offices, factory offices, and schools are all actively contacting the company to install them as soon as possible. Shops in other cities are eagerly seeking to become exclusive distributors. Major department stores such as the China National Products Company, Sincere, Wing On, and Foo An are also experiencing significant sales. This is truly good news for the domestic goods industry, which has been in a slump for years.</p>
<p>Recent News from the China National Products Agency: The China National Products Agency has been operating for over a month, and its recent work has become even more intensive.

He especially enjoys making seal inkpads and has been meticulously studying this art for over twenty years, finally achieving success. His handmade inkpads are all as red as cinnabar, with a pearly luster that dazzles the eyes. They are truly unprecedented masterpieces. The best of these are made with lotus silk, and connoisseurs who obtain them cherish them as treasures, respectfully calling them the "Inkpad Emperor." The next best is made with wild mugwort down, divided into eight grades: Divine, Exquisite, High, Fine, Super, Excellent, Superior, and Good. Recently, in response to requests from enthusiasts, he has agreed to sell them in Shanghai. He currently resides at the Xiyin Study, No. 19 Furun Alley, at the intersection of Beijing Road and Guizhou Road.

If friends are sick and seek treatment, he can always cure them quickly. However, he is unwilling to practice medicine publicly, so patients who wish to seek Xia Ziyi's diagnosis must have a close friend introduce them.</p>

<p>Payment notices for the September funding for Jiangsu provincial middle schools and normal schools (October for rural normal schools and elementary schools, the second half of September and the first half of October for social education institutions and vocational schools) have been signed by the auditors and sent to the Department of Education for stamping. However, because the treasury had just cleared the August funding for provincial schools and the September funding for rural normal schools and elementary schools, only one to two million yuan in cash remained. It was not convenient to issue bounced checks (if the payment notices were issued first, but the treasury lacked sufficient funds, the bank would not be able to cash them, making them no different from bounced checks), so they were withheld. It is reported that the current treasury balance is over 80,000 yuan. In addition, the educational funds that various counties are submitting one after another are expected to be deposited by the 25th of this month (approximately on the 23rd or 24th). The Jiangsu Education Funding Management Office will first issue payment notices for half a month's funding, and schools and social education institutions can receive half a month's cash after receiving the notices.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Women's Basketball Association will conclude on the 27th of this month. The Southeast and Liangjiang teams in Group A have won all four games, and their situations are equal. They will meet tonight to decide the championship, starting at 6:30 p.m. at the Chinese Basketball Hall on Father Lao Road. The past achievements of the two teams have been praised, and they are indeed the first-class women's basketball teams in Shanghai. Even Western teams look at them with admiration. In terms of skills, each has its own strengths. Once they meet, the intensity of the competition and the quality of the performance will be as expected. The results of each team in Group A are recorded below.</p>

<p>Among Group B, Qiangdong has won all five games and is currently in first place. The team that can compete with Qiangdong for the championship is Liangliang. Liangliang could have won all five games, but they forfeited the game against Guanghua the other day due to being late, which is a pity. If the team later defeats Qiangdong, the two teams will have the same record and another final will be needed to decide the championship. If Liangliang loses to Qiangdong, the championship will belong to Qiangdong. Therefore, Liangliang's last chance lies in the game against Qiangdong.</p>

<p>(Beijing News) After the closing of the National Games, the situation of the four late-arriving athletes from Qinghai, including Ma Si, and the head of the team, Zhao Yongjian, a total of five people, has been reported previously. It is heard that these five people have submitted a written request to the President of the National Games (i.e., the Minister of Education) for a subsidy for travel expenses to return to Qinghai. Minister Wang of the Ministry of Education has approved a discretionary subsidy. At the same time, the National Games has contacted the Ministry of Railways to make train tickets free for the athletes to return to Qinghai. The problem is generally resolved. After the athletes arrived in Beijing on the 5th of this month, in addition to visiting the Central Stadium, Liu Yabai, a staff member of the National Games, led the five athletes to visit the National Martial Arts Hall, Central University, the Mongolian-Tibetan Training Class, and other schools. In order to encourage and promote sports, the National Games specially presented the late-arriving athletes with prizes: a silver shield, a silk-woven mirror frame, a large flag presented by the Panchen Lama, several military and sports books, a copy of the Revolutionary Plan in true form, and six other books.) and gave words of encouragement. The main points (1) The National Games has closed, but they still came with courage, which is commendable, (2) I hope that after returning to Qinghai, they will publicize and vigorously promote the central government's intention to promote sports, (3) I hope that when the meeting is held in 24 years, they will be able to come and participate to show good results. The athletes are still staying in hotels, and they will go to Shanghai to visit schools after receiving the subsidy.</p>

<p>The tennis match adopted a three-match two-win system. First was the singles match, in which both Liang Deguang and Zhuang Shouchi won effortlessly. However, in the match between Ma Candan and Mao Lianhou, because the two players' skills were similar, the game was up and down. Ma Candan's draw pressure was poor, and he lost to Mao Kanghou 7-5, 11-9, which took a lot of effort. As for the two doubles matches, they won one and lost one. In total, Fudan won 4-1.

<h3 id="e219">Special Article China: An Overview of Modern Educational Thought (5) - Narrated by Shu Xincheng, Notes by Sun Yucai <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>(3) The Period of the New Culture Movement (1919-1923/24): In 1919, due to diplomatic issues, China experienced the May Fourth Movement. The New Culture Movement was conceived in response to this. Because of the advocacy of the New Culture Movement, old morality, old thoughts, and old culture were vehemently criticized. Even Confucius was among those to be overthrown. They believed that China's decline was not merely a matter of political corruption, but resulted from the failure of social thought and social systems. The influence of the New Culture Movement at that time was truly beyond description. The articles written by Chen Duxiu and others in the "New Youth" magazine strongly advocated that China could only be saved through democracy, science, freedom, and liberation. For the sake of clarity, I will categorize the relevant educational thoughts of this period into five aspects for separate explanation.</p>
<p>Vocational Education Thought: Vocational education thought originated from two sources: first, the needs of domestic society; and second, the stimulation of European and American vocational education thought. The term "vocational education" was first coined by Lu Feikui, and the most vigorous promoter afterwards was the Chinese Vocational Education Society. There are varying interpretations and definitions of vocational education. Huang Yanpei said, "Any education method that enables everyone to obtain livelihood and enjoyment, and at the same time fulfill their obligations to the community, is called vocational education." Zou Enrun said, "Vocational education prepares one to master a skill, engage in productive endeavors beneficial to society, and seek a proper life. Its greatest goal is to cultivate one's intellect, will, and emotions, and to become a completely useful person." Speaking of the practical impact of vocational education thought, it was indeed very significant, unmatched by other ideologies. First, it occupied a formal and important position in the new school system. Second, it achieved great success in implementation. Since Huang Yanpei and others founded the Chinese Vocational Education Society in 1917 as an organization for researching and promoting vocational education, they established the Chinese Vocational School to conduct practical experiments. Subsequently, it developed rapidly and vigorously. However, simply advocating vocational education cannot solve the employment problems of the intellectual class. It is necessary to pay attention to political issues and social undertakings, and seek comprehensive and unified progress. Because China's politics are not on track and social undertakings are very underdeveloped, although vocational education thought is constantly advancing and vocational education institutions are increasing daily, the acute employment problem among intellectuals remains unresolved.</p>
<p>Democratic Education Thought: Democratic education is another name for democracy (Democracy) education, or popular education. It originated in the early years of the Republic of China and flourished after 1919. There are three reasons for its great popularity: first, external influence from world trends; second, the influence of the Literary Revolution, during which new ideas were introduced and old ideas were criticized as much as possible. At that time, the democratic thought after the European war was transmitted to China, and everyone could freely accept it without any restrictions; third, the May Fourth Movement, whose purpose was the transformation of politics, was actually the result of the collision of old and new ideas. John Dewey also came to China at this time with his democratic educational philosophy and lectured, supplemented by the vigorous advocacy of Hu Shi and other pioneers of the Chinese Literary Revolution, so democratic educational thought flourished at that time. Its first influence was the destruction of the central centralization system, the adoption of elective courses, and the free experimentation of teaching methods. The second is that women have the same opportunities as men in education. The third is the development of civilian education. The fourth is the close relationship between politics and education. The fifth is the increase in students' power. The above five things are only the greater influences that democratic educational thought has had on practical education in China. In detail, there are naturally more than these. For example, the youth's literary enthusiasm and love enthusiasm are related to this educational thought. But these alone are enough to show the power of this educational thought. During this period, there were only two broad roads in front of us: the first is the cultivation of a scientific spirit, and the second is the promotion of material civilization. The power to lead these two roads naturally lies in the government's education policy. However, every member of the education community has power. I just don’t know what educators think about the state of affairs.</p>
<p>Independent Education Thought: Humans must seek education for their living needs, and because education is a tool to achieve life goals, everyone needs to use this tool to achieve their expected goals. Therefore, the independent thinking of the education community erupted, believing that it was not necessary to rely on the government, so there was a movement of "educational independence." First, it started with the independence of education funding, and later, due to religious and political party issues, various disputes arose in education. Therefore, it extended from the independence of education funding to complete independence from politics and religion in legislation and administration. In fact, strictly speaking, the four characters of educational independence, formed into a noun, are really not very reasonable, but in the history of modern education, there is actually a kind of educational independence thought, which even lasted for ten years in time and filled the whole country in space. Its changes are four: at first, there was the idea of independent education funding due to the arrears of funding; later, because the independence of education funding could not be achieved unless education was separated from the political tide first, it further advocated the independence of education affairs, and further advocated the independence of education from political parties and religions. This is the system of the development of independent educational thought. Outside this system, there is a part of the independence of teachers' personality and academic aspects in higher education. In general, independent educational thought has little practical impact, because education is a part of national administration. Whether the country adopts party politics or non-party politics, those who hold political power naturally want to express their political propositions or policies, and education will naturally be dominated by their policies or propositions. Independence is really difficult to realize.</p>
<p>Scientific Education Thought: In 1921, Paul Monroe of the United States was hired by the Practical Education Investigation Society to investigate education in China and strongly stated that scientific education in China was failing in various ways. The following year, the Education Improvement Society hired an American, Push, to come to China to guide scientific education, and scientific education became very popular. At that time, the scientific education thought was a reflection of foreign insults, and a reflection of the impracticality of the new education. Although it has lasted for more than 30 years in the history of education in China, it has had little impact on practical education. There are two main factors why scientific education is ineffective in China: the first is national habits, and the second is the poison of science. But the need for China to promote scientific education, I am afraid that except for Tagore and other figures who praise Eastern spiritual civilization, there will be no problem. Although we cannot discuss the specific implementation plan here, we can determine that there are two directions for its progress: first, on the positive side, vigorously advocate the Chinese people to work hard to create material civilization and arouse their demand for scientific research; second, on the negative side, vigorously break the current lottery-like bad habit of officials, so that people have to support themselves and indirectly develop science by working hard in production construction.</p>
<p>Non-Religious Education Thought: After the Republic of China, internal turmoil continued, education funding was in arrears for a long time, and education undertakings were also manipulated by warlords and politicians, allowing them to play tricks at will, so that inherent schools could not be maintained, let alone developed, while church schools took advantage of that time to take the opportunity to promote themselves because they were not affected by domestic politics. At that time, the so-called religious education institutions were almost only Christian church schools, so non-religious education simply took non-Christian church schools as the only object. In fact, it is "non" all religious education. After the May Fourth Movement, the people's thinking was greatly liberated, and they re-evaluated the value of everything in society with a skeptical attitude. Everyone believes that education is a tool to study and enlighten the human spirit, and religion is a shackle that forces faith and blocks human wisdom. Education must be separated from religion in order to show its true spirit of free development, so religion and education cannot be combined. At that time, Mr. Cai Yuanpei's theory of aesthetic education replacing religion won people's confidence, and in practice, organizations such as the Non-Religious Grand Alliance and the Non-Christian Grand Alliance were established to engage in fierce action against it. The idea of non-religious education was so serious, and later, due to the new nationalism in politics and the new rationalism in thought as the background, as well as world trends and the turbulence of domestic political groups, the result was that it had a great impact on education. On January 16 of the fourteenth year, the Ministry of Education promulgated the Measures for Requesting Approval for Establishing Schools with Foreign Donations. Its content, on the one hand, paid attention to the recovery of the education school, and on the other hand, paid attention to the independence of education from religion. On the civil side, they urgently sought to break away from education schools and create new schools by themselves. Why can it have such a big impact on education? That is because religious education does not have a deep-rooted foundation in Chinese national thought. Its development completely depends on the oppression of foreign forces and the chaos of internal affairs. Its nature was originally a rootless duckweed, so when it encountered the storm of national movement and rationalism, coupled with the push of world trends and domestic political groups, it had to disappear.</p>

<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>丨Who controls the vitality of domestic goods? The power lies with the women.丨</p>
<p>We have tried our best to promote domestic products throughout the year. However, like "dancing while carrying a stone mortar," it's hard work without reward. How much benefit has it brought to the domestic product industry? It's truly minimal. This is not surprising, because every family has a housewife, commonly known as the "head of the household," and the power to adopt domestic products lies in their hands. Most male heads of household just talk, make a fuss, give speeches, and join in, which is like useless effort. If you don't believe it, please go to the entrance of the Chinese National Products Company in Shanghai and watch the people coming and going. Are there more male heads of household or female heads of household? Sometimes these female heads of household also listen to their daughters. As long as their daughters say that domestic products are suitable for them and how useful they are, they will happily buy as much as possible for their beautiful daughters and become loyal believers in domestic products. Therefore, the vitality of domestic goods can be said to be completely in the hands of women. In the future, when the bosses of domestic product factories welcome the god of wealth, they must not welcome the male god of wealth, but the female god of wealth. In particular, they must please the many "Jade Emperors" in other people's homes, and flatter the "Guanyin Bodhisattvas" and their sons and daughters. This is not a joke. We have indeed taken some wrong paths in the past, that is, we have failed to mobilize the ladies to promote domestic products, which is a big mistake. If the ladies and daughters are willing to come out with sincerity and promote domestic products, then it will be easy to achieve twice the results with half the effort. Fortunately, at the end of this year, there is finally some good news: the Women's Christian Temperance Union's domestic product exhibition. Their exhibition has swept away the old stereotypes and is completely centered on the family, creating a model domestic product family. From the living room, dining room, bedroom, to the kitchen and toilet, all are decorated and displayed with domestic products, adopting the principles of beauty, economy, tranquility, hygiene, and simplicity, and arranged according to three kinds of budgets based on the amount of each person's economic income. This kind of display can make people have the value of research, which is really in line with scientific methods. The day before yesterday, I heard Ms. Yu Yingjie, the wife of the director of the association, and Ms. Qian say: "I hope that the domestic product factories that send products to the association for display will display them for the domestic product movement, not just for their own convenience." They also said: "This exhibition is not rigid and dead, but fluid and alive. For example, we must come up with good styles for children's clothing and women's fashion, and everyone will criticize and study them together, so that domestic products can progress." Mrs. Yu also said: "Shanghai's use of domestic products is the most important and most effective. If every woman in Shanghai uses domestic products for food and clothing, the trend will be such that people in the interior will probably use domestic products exclusively. If Shanghai people wear domestic silk and cloth, I guarantee that Suzhou and Hangzhou people will wear domestic silk and cloth within a week. Because the people in the interior can be said to completely imitate the people in Shanghai, and Shanghai people have the power to shift the trend." These words all have meaning. It is said that it will open on December 14 at the Association on Yuanmingyuan Road in Shanghai. This is the most gratifying thing in the domestic product year.</p>

<h3 id="e221">Domestic Goods and Children's Education <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— Ba Ling</p>
<p>This year is the year of domestic products. In principle, the results of promoting domestic products should be much more advanced than in the past. In this way, the name is also appropriate, but the facts are placed in front of us, which really makes us very sad. This year, the results of domestic product sales are not seen to be very clever, but Japanese goods are selling and selling especially well in the market. The year of domestic products has created an opportunity for Japanese goods to sell. Isn’t it strange!</p>
<p>Mr. Yan Esheng and Pan Yangyao both said, "This year is the year of the bank," and some people say, "This year is the year of shelving goods," and some people even say, "This year is the year of Japanese goods," which is really an inspiring statement!</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that to promote domestic products, we still need to do some thorough work and start from the lower level to be effective. Our adults, because our minds are basically full of the mentality of worshiping foreign goods, so the propagandists are all shouting hoarsely, but the effect is very small!</p>
<p>What is the basic work at the lower level? The author believes that promoting domestic products must start with children and publicize to children, so that in the minds of children, from small to large, there is a mentality that only domestic products are bought, and that buying foreign goods is a great shame. If this concept is formed in the minds of every child, I believe that in less than ten years, our national goods will fall without being beaten, and the domestic goods movement will not need to be promoted and promoted by itself.</p>
<p>However, this basic and great work still needs to be done by us adults. Parents should explain to children every day, and be able to set an example by their own actions. At the same time, teachers must also publicize to students at all times, and also set an example by their own actions. Only in this way can the domestic goods movement be completed, and the national economy will have a day of abundance, and the people's lives will be freed from hardship. Otherwise, our national front is not allowed to be optimistic.</p>
<p>Therefore, the promotion of domestic products should go hand in hand with children's education. Readers, after reading my views, I don’t know what you think?</p>
<h3 id="e222">Young People, Stop Being Salesmen for Foreign Goods <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Xuan Wan</p>
<p>Is it true that in these few years, the Chinese market is entirely under the occupation of foreign economic forces? Have our excellent young people not tasted enough of this taste of aggression, and are they not aware of the downturn in domestic industry and commerce and the bankruptcy of the social economy, and are there still people who are good at using foreign goods? Naturally, the vast majority of young people are assisting the advancement of domestic product undertakings and moving towards their bright road. However, only a small group of young people are anesthetized by the hateful reality, but temporarily lost their nature and became salesmen for foreign goods, which is not only useless to the future of domestic goods, but also an obstacle to the revival of the social economy.</p>
<p>The fact is this, probably the psychology of this part of the young people is completely anesthetized in the hateful reality, and the invasion of vanity to their hearts, and the pressure of the social environment, naturally, is enough to make them lose their nature. Therefore, wearing suits and leather shoes, (in fact, domestic goods also have leather shoes and suits, but they must not be foreign goods), fully authentic imported goods, go up and down dance halls, wine shops, and even movies must be foreign films. In this way, the rolling outflow of snow-white money every year is not a small number, and the national vitality is also severely depleted several times.</p>
<p>After witnessing these contradictory facts, I think that no matter who it is, they will deeply feel infinite pain, thinking that these people's hearts are dead, but it is useless to be sad. We must have practical methods. Of course, these people have all received higher education, petty bourgeois, or even are still in higher education. Now we naturally only have to promote domestic goods to influence them, but this method still needs to be discussed and decided by us.</p>
<p>Young people are the backbone of society, the masters of our future, the focus of society, and what everyone expects. Moreover, it is also their duty to promote domestic goods. This responsibility and obligation are of course inescapable and cannot be shirked. What's more, in this autumn of turmoil and crisis, how should the young people of our country unite as one and strive to promote domestic goods and block foreign goods, so as to make the country and society's economy the safest and most consolidated way.</p>
<p>Discussion of National Products</p>
<h3 id="e223">Prelude to the National Goods Agency <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Duanmu Luzeng</p>
<p>Using domestic goods is of course the bounden duty of the Chinese people: but when needed, many difficulties often arise, such as the difficulty in distinguishing when purchasing, especially those unscrupulous merchants who, for their own benefit, do not hesitate to change the appearance of enemy goods, so that compatriots who love to use domestic goods can easily buy inferior goods if they are not careful. At the same time, there are many compatriots who are unwilling to go to reliable domestic goods stores to purchase because of the distance of their residences, and purchase in nearby stores, so that they mistakenly purchase inferior goods; but there is also a biggest fatal injury that can prevent domestic goods from developing to the society and penetrating into the people, that is, it is difficult for production and consumption to cooperate. On the production side, they often like to cater to the temporary psychology of consumers, so they cannot last; and there are many producers who often like to imitate the products of others that already have considerable value, so that consumers have no choice; and there are many domestic goods who have gained social belief, but because they are unwilling to improve from time to time, the result is still losing social trust; but what about the consumer side? They are unwilling to announce frankly the fine imported products they want, so that domestic goods factories can try to manufacture substitutes; and even if there are domestic goods substitutes, how should they be reformed and researched during use, and the experience after research is also unwilling to be announced to promote the improvement of producers, so that the current domestic goods cannot be improved from time to time; in the meantime, it seems that there is an obstacle between domestic goods and the Chinese people, and they do not communicate with each other and are indifferent, but the real reason is that there is still a lack of a mechanism in China to communicate between domestic goods and the Chinese people; a lack of a spirit to break this obstacle and do practical work.</p>
<p>According to the above situation, it seems to be a pessimistic and serious problem in the domestic goods industry; indeed, this is an extremely pessimistic and extremely serious problem; but recently I have received reliable news that is really worth exciting our spirit, that is, a specialized agency has recently been discovered in Shanghai that solves all the above-mentioned problems! This is a domestic goods agency that works hard and does not advocate empty talk, and specializes in implementing practical work; it is located in the Chinese National Goods Guidance Center attached to the Chinese Vocational Education Society at No. 80 Hualong Road, French Concession, Shanghai. Since September 18th, in view of the increasingly serious national crisis, but saving the country does not advocate empty talk, and if the country wants to be strong, we must first start from promoting domestic goods and guiding producers to strive to improve products; under the cooperation of several famous domestic goods factories in Shanghai and the Chinese Vocational Education Society, the institute was immediately established; since its establishment, the work it has done includes guiding the Chinese people to purchase domestic goods, guiding the production side to strive to improve products, holding exhibitions, investigating the content of domestic goods factories in Shanghai, compiling and printing various books. Recently, it has paid special attention to the cooperation between production and sales, and guiding Russians to purchase domestic goods. However, past experience tells them that if there is no implementing agency, it is impossible to find good results by relying on the power of publicity first, so they resolutely decided to set up a Chinese National Goods Agency, attached to the Chinese National Goods Guidance Center. According to the person in charge of the department, preparations have been made so far, and it has now been officially established to serve domestic people who eat. It handles purchasing affairs on behalf of others. In this city, you only need to notify by telephone, and the department will send someone to contact you. Outside this city, you only need to notify in writing. The method is simple and the cost is saved. It is expected that the future of the department is truly unlimited!</p>
<p>At the same time, the department will conduct a general survey of all agencies, schools, families, and individuals in Shanghai, and report the feelings and improvement opinions of the current domestic goods industry to various domestic goods factories for reference and improvement. At the same time, the department will connect the two lines of production and consumption, so that producers have fine domestic goods products that are especially suitable for the needs of the Chinese people; so that consumers have fine domestic goods products that are especially suitable for their own tastes; at the same time, the department can also prevent the Chinese people from mistakenly purchasing inferior goods, and avoid all kinds of troubles when purchasing goods, and can also get extremely favorable discounts, because every cell of the department is organized by various domestic goods factories in Shanghai; if you, the readers, have any questions, the department will definitely have a very satisfactory answer.</p>

<p>— Pillow Wood</p>
<p>Organizing an Exchange for Surplus Materials</p>
<p>Currently, efforts to promote domestic goods are focused on two aspects: advocating the use of domestic goods and manufacturing them. Looking at the establishment of groups promoting domestic goods, the opening of domestic goods companies, and the founding of domestic goods factories, their achievements are evident. However, the development of the domestic goods industry is endless. Our work is truly insignificant and requires even greater effort and expansion. What we must not overlook is finding ways to reduce the cost of raw materials for domestic goods. Only by reducing the cost of raw materials can the price of goods be lowered. Besides increasing the production of raw materials and reducing transportation costs, we should also unite local factories, large and small, to organize an exchange for surplus materials. This exchange could be sponsored by the Association of Machine-Made Domestic Goods Factories. All surplus scraps and waste materials from various factories could be registered and sold through the exchange. Those who need various surplus materials could request representation from the exchange. In this way, factories with excess scrap materials, such as narrow iron strips from canneries, paper scraps from printing houses, rubber scraps from rubber shoe factories, and waste yarn and threads from yarn and cloth factories, can find a renewed purpose and avoid being discarded and wasted. Isn't that ideal? Furthermore, factories that need such raw materials, such as celluloid factories needing rags and wood shavings, and box factories needing paper scraps and cloth edges, can rely on the exchange for supplies, avoiding the trouble of collecting and soliciting, and without fear of running out. Therefore, the organization of an exchange for surplus materials is truly a beneficial measure that achieves two goals with one effort and should not be delayed. May domestic goods manufacturers recognize this and cooperate to contribute to the glory of the domestic goods industry.</p>

<p>— Sisi</p>
<p>"Which young man doesn't love? Which maiden doesn't cherish spring? Almost every girl or boy is probably enthusiastic about love! A tender heart dreams daily of a beloved, sweet person for comfort. This is a general phenomenon that no one can deny.</p>
<p>Although falling in love is a legitimate thing, and also something necessary for people to live, there are several important points that both parties should pay special attention to during the course of love. Let's not discuss other aspects for now, and just focus on the mutual understanding of domestic goods, which is already very important.</p>
<p>Looking around our current motherland, the depth of national crisis is beyond measure. The vast and fertile lands of the three northeastern provinces and Rehe, hundreds of millions of square miles, have been detached from our thousands-year-old territory and seized by others. Countless beloved compatriots are living there as full-fledged slaves to a foreign power, and the enemy is still eyeing us covetously, eager to try us. Perhaps one day our compatriots here will suffer the same fate as them. Before the enemy's iron cavalry arrives, if we don't take the most powerful measure - advocating domestic goods - to resist, we will inevitably become slaves of a foreign power.</p>
<p>When a man and woman are intimately engaged in love, either party will often go to great lengths to obey and strive for the opinions of their beloved. If a girl or boy asks the other to use domestic goods during their courtship, it is extremely easy to achieve and yields great results. I hope young men and women will consider this!</p>

<p>These past few Sundays, the weather has been very good, so we took advantage of it to go to the interior and rural areas. Changzhou, Wuxi, Caohejing, and Nanxiang were all places we visited. In Changzhou, we saw the Tongcheng Textile Factory and admired Mr. Chi Zongmo's perseverance and enthusiasm in striving for the domestic goods industry. In Wuxi, we saw many tall chimneys and admired the developed entrepreneurial spirit of the people of Wuxi even more. In Caohejing, we saw the Huxi Farm and the agricultural group of the Qianjiao Society, and realized that our vitality lies in such places. Recently, in Nanxiang, we saw Mr. Gu Xiyuan's Revitalization of Rural Subsidiary Occupations Association, which uses the improvement of weaving as a starting point and promotes planting vegetables, raising pigs, sheep, chickens, and fish. After seeing the weaving factory and the plantation, we realized that the words posted on his wall, "No wasted land, no wasted time, no wasted effort, no wasted wealth," were not empty words. His methods of renting and transferring looms are threefold: first, a one-time purchase for 50 yuan per loom; second, an installment purchase, paid in four months, for 55 yuan per loom; third, a rental, paying two yuan per month. If a loom malfunctions, the association will send someone to repair it without charging a repair fee. The money for weaving can be paid to the association at a price (in whole or in part) to collect, or a guarantor can be found for borrowing. The woven cloth must be submitted every five days. The width and length of the cloth are all in accordance with the regulations of the association. Wages are based on the quality of the finished product and the amount of production, with a fixed standard. Mr. Gu pays attention to this kind of work to save the countryside, in addition to his own business. It's admirable and praiseworthy. Later, we visited Mr. Ye Youcai's Shengming Electric Light Factory. He also came with the aim of serving the local area. Not long after taking over, he had two commendable achievements. One is to increase the brightness of the lights, and the other is to reduce electricity bills. He has to sacrifice four to five hundred yuan per month without any reluctance. He is also building a motor factory nearby, which is currently under construction and is very large in scale, giving the people of Xiangdi another place to work. It can be seen that there is no need to worry about the poor and bitter local areas, and the decline of the countryside. What is worrying is that there are only money-hoarders and no entrepreneurs. After a day of traveling in Xiang, the feelings I gained are as follows:</p>
<p>Everyone talks about saving the countryside, but what's the use of empty words? Benefiting others starts with overcoming oneself, and enterprises benefit people more.</p>
<p>Historical Records of Domestic Goods</p>
<h3 id="e228">The Beginning and End of the Nantong Native Cloth Movement <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Qiacheng</p>
<p>The sound of cannons on September 18th shook the society of Nantong and Haimen, not only arousing the impulse of national consciousness in the intellectual circles, but also greatly affecting the handicraft weaving industry. Because the bulk cloth of the two counties of Tonghai was sold solely in the Northeast, since the Shenyang Incident, Tonghai cloth had been piling up in Shanghai. Cloth shops were suspended due to stranded funds, and the countryside became increasingly impoverished due to the destruction of subsidiary occupations. The commerce of large and small towns in the two counties of Tonghai suddenly became desolate. This was the objective environment for the formation of the Tonghai Native Cloth Movement.</p>
<p>The initial native cloth movement was also a reform movement. In terms of weaving, new machines and new methods were adopted, which were advocated by public education institutions, and a lot of effort was put into promotion and encouragement. From cities to towns, Tonghai held many native cloth exhibitions and promoted them widely, creating a surging phenomenon for a time.</p>
<p>Because of emotional reasons, under the slogan "Nantong people use Nantong cloth," the improved cloth sold very well, so that all parties purchased machines and manufactured them. There were also many elementary school teachers who put down their teaching whips and went to the looms. However, because production and sales were not controlled, it was not long before, on the one hand, the emotion cooled down and, on the other hand, sales in the countryside were sluggish. In addition, there was competition from the same industry, not in the pursuit of excellence in quality and output, but in reducing materials and lowering prices, so that the reputation of Nantong's improved cloth, before it was replaced to other places, suddenly prospered and then suddenly declined.</p>
<p>The lessons given to us from this Nantong Native Cloth Movement are, on the one hand, the fragility of the foundation of emotional purchasing factors; on the other hand, it is enough to prove that irregular infighting in the same industry is useless. At the same time, the indifference of urban people to rural subsidiary occupations, and the pessimism about the future of national cloth, are also serious problems.</p>
<p>Therefore, this is by no means the responsibility of a few individuals, nor is it a simple problem on one side. If we want to liberate ourselves from the suppression of rayon, we must pay attention to the way out for national cloth, and before the future of the Chinese native cloth movement has been solved for many problems, we must strictly prevent repeating the mistakes of the Nantong reform movement.</p>
<p>Finally, my hope is that the educational and industrial circles of Nantong will work hard again!</p>

<h3 id="e229">A Visit to Huikang Farm <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— Lianru</p>
<p>Everyone knows that our country has been an agricultural country since ancient times. The number of farmers accounts for about 88% of the total population of the country, so the bankruptcy of the rural economy is also the bankruptcy of the entire national economy. Recently, aren't we making a fuss about the revitalization of the countryside? Of course, the decline of the rural economy is affected by politics, but we are also too self-defeating and pay too little attention to the subsidiary occupations of farmers. Therefore, not only is the rural economy bankrupt, but also foreign agricultural by-products are constantly being transported to China. In order to promote domestic agricultural by-products to resist foreign goods, and to remedy the rural economy, we must set up more farms to produce more products, such as honey, milk, canned food, etc., and to promote the attention and awareness of farmers.</p>
<p>I have had this idea for a long time and thought about visiting Huikang Farm, but it was not until a few days ago that I was able to fulfill my wish. Although it was early autumn, walking under the morning sun made me sweat a lot. The farm is located at the west end of Sheqiao, Tonghui Road. After a long stretch of coal slag road, we arrived at the farm. More than ten feet away from the south of the farm is a sign with the four large characters "Huikang Farm" written by Mr. Hua Yizhi. The size of the farm is about 20 to 30 acres, surrounded by a very high bamboo fence. After entering the door, the first thing that caught my eye was a very clean and spacious cow farm. There were one or two dozen cows feeding in the farm, and the cows were also very clean. Next to it were the business office and the office. Next door to the east was the milk filling room. A worker in white was working. Milk was released from the milk filling machine, bottle by bottle, without the need for human fingers to touch the milk, which was indeed hygienic. Next door to the east was the bottle washing and disinfection room. The water used for washing bottles was disinfected water and artesian well water. Behind this building was a new-style, light-gathering and ventilated cowshed, which was very high, spacious, and refreshing. The artesian well stood tall on the east side of the house. There were also cold storage rooms and boiler rooms, which I didn't look at carefully one by one, and the valuable space doesn't allow me to write them out carefully one by one.</p>
<p>The founders and managers of this farm are all experts in agricultural affairs, such as Mr. Hua Yizhi, Gao Jianji, Liu Pingjiang, and Huang Xiaomin. The businesses that the farm has already run include sterilized milk, white pagoda oil, honey, and biscuits mixed with milk, honey, and eggs. In order to popularize these by-products, the farm does not hesitate to sacrifice and sell bee breeding, chickens, and dairy cows at low prices. In our country, domestic goods such as white pagoda oil and honey are indeed rare, so it is also worth writing about for fellow citizens who care about domestic goods to see.</p>

<p>— Huang Kangtun</p>
<p>Literary Man 丨 A bachelor of arts, who graduated from S University not long ago, with artistic hair, serge suit, white hard collar, Indian silk tie, and leather shoes.</p>
<p>Weaver Girl 丨 A disheveled and strong village girl, wearing a moon-white short cloth jacket, a blue cloth apron, and black cloth shoes.</p>
<p>Literary Man: (Holding a pen, tilting his head, thinking deeply there.)</p>
<p>Weaver Girl: Sir! Can you lend me some black ink to dye the head yarn of the loom?</p>
<p>Literary Man: I only have blue, not black.</p>
<p>Weaver Girl: Sir, don't you use black ink for writing articles?</p>
<p>Literary Man: I use a "Fountain Pen" dipped in "No Stain" to write.</p>
<p>Weaver Girl: What are you saying, sir? I can't understand it.</p>
<p>Literary Man: Hey! Look! (Lifting up his fountain pen.) I always use this pen to write, why would I need black ink!丨. You work so hard weaving cloth, how much money can you earn in a day?</p>
<p>Weaver Girl: To tell you the truth, sir, from early morning to late night, weaving a piece of cloth, the market is not very good, but I can earn half a thousand copper coins. If the market was good a few years ago...</p>
<p>Literary Man: Hey! Half a thousand copper coins, five dimes of silver... I write half a thousand words a day and can earn three or four dollars.</p>
<p>Weaver Girl: (Surprised) Articles! They can't even be exchanged for a piece of tofu at a tofu shop. Can they be sold for money?</p>
<p>Literary Man: As long as the articles are written opportunistically, they are much more promising than weaving cloth.</p>
<p>Weaver Girl: How to be opportunistic?</p>
<p>Literary Man: For example, this year everyone is promoting domestic goods, and factories are spending money to buy publicity articles; as long as you describe the benefits of domestic goods in a flamboyant way, so that every Chinese person should eat domestic products, wear silk cloth, and use domestic goods; promote domestic goods, how it can save the country, how it can force the Japanese dwarfs to death... If you write like this and send it to the newspaper, the editor will nod his head after reading it, and it's guaranteed to be valuable.</p>
<p>Weaver Girl: Oh! So that's how it is. Then why do you, sir, promote domestic goods with all your might, but wear foreign clothes, wear foreign cloth, and write with foreign pens?</p>

<p>(I) Prologue</p>
<p>Believe it or not! However, these are facts, definitely not propaganda or alarmist talk. Facts speak louder than words, placed before you, how can you not believe it!</p>
<p>(II) Airplane to Whose Home</p>
<p>The Tianchu MSG Factory donates one year's profit, which can buy an airplane; however, every year the leakage of funds from purchasing foreign goods, I don't know how many airplanes are indirectly donated to others!</p>
<p>(III) Extraordinary Times are Essential</p>
<p>The Japanese are also shouting about national crisis, with extremely eye-catching slogans in newspapers saying: "Extraordinary times in Japan, fellow citizens, use domestic (Japanese) goods."</p>
<p>(IV) 270 Million</p>
<p>The International Trade Bureau reported that in the first half of this year, imports from various ports in my country were 43 million and exports were nearly 16 million, with a trade deficit of over 270 million; China's rural areas are bankrupt and the economy is declining, and there is still such a leakage!</p>
<p>(V) Modern New Interpretation</p>
<p>Modern men and women are experts in selling foreign goods, seeking only foreignization in clothing, food, housing, and transportation; it is said that modern itself is an imported product, blind worship is no accident.</p>
<p>(VI) What Countryman Are You</p>
<p>Mr. Huang Renzhi once asked many friends, "What countryman are you?" Now, we have to ask foreign goods worshippers in turn: "What country are you from?"</p>
<p>Literary Man: It's convenient and decent. Moreover... these... China also 丨丨</p>
<p>Weaver Girl: Now the native cloth we weave, the Kwantung has also cut off the road; gentlemen keep advocating domestic goods, why don't you dare to wear domestic cloth? Don't be laughed at for saying one thing and meaning another.</p>
<p>Literary Man: Though I advocate it, I must look beautiful.</p>
<p>Weaver Girl: If we only talk loudly, where will the beautiful domestic goods come from? Literary man…</p>
<p>Weaver Girl: Literary people only know how to open their mouths, while weaver girls can move their hands. Those who open their mouths don't move their hands; those who move their hands don't open their mouths. I advise everyone to open their mouths less and move their hands more, and 400 million people don't have to worry about not having a way to go.</p>

<p>The "Beauty Cream" produced by Wuzhou Pharmacy has pure ingredients and a rich aroma, which can make the skin white and delicate and protect it from the threat of cold air.

<p>Mr. Jiang Chongnian wrote a letter, and this magazine immediately asked the China National Goods Guidance Institute to investigate. The institute has now replied as follows. Among Shanghai's domestic toothpicks, the "Hand Brand" produced by the China Toothpick Factory is the best. We confirm that the "Happy Brand" produced by the Shanghai Family Wood Products Factory is indeed a newly produced domestic toothpick. The factory is located in the French Concession, at Pingyuanfang, Jiasiyi Road, and was established two years ago. The business is good. The wholesale department entrusts Ren Dachang, Gongguan Road, to distribute it. In addition, the products of Tianzhang Paper Mill are also good, and they are purely domestic products, which should be vigorously promoted. However, the factory does not yet produce the rolled paper used by newspapers. Many publications and series published by bookstores in this city use the factory's products. In the future, we should vigorously advocate and gradually adopt them to live up to your enthusiasm for domestic goods. (Editor)</p>

<p>Our domestic goods, except for Triangle brand towels, Samsung brand toothpaste, Lihe brand washbasins, Renzhong brand cotton yarn, Invincible brand tooth powder, and Goose brand undershirts, the rest are hardly noticed by Chinese people. Now I want to talk about how compatriots can recognize domestic goods? The following points are listed. (1) Crude appearance (2) Solid texture (3) Foolish style (4) Real trademark</p>
<p>To recognize domestic goods, we must first understand how the companies that sell them are doing, and then understand domestic goods, so that we can get a very deep impression and not be at a loss! In short, if you can't determine whether it is a domestic product? You may as well trust the Shanghai China National Goods Company, whose identification of domestic goods is very qualified.</p>
<h3 id="e235">After Disappointment <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— Shou</p>
<p>In this domestic goods year of reviving national spirit and cultivating national vitality, domestic goods manufacturers are flourishing like bamboo shoots after rain, which is really gratifying. However, in reality, foreign goods still fill the Chinese market and do not shake its solid foundation due to the surge in domestic products. Are the Chinese all blind worshippers of foreign goods? I can't help but feel a little doubtful.</p>
<p>In order to move the place, I specially spent two dollars and some cents to buy a spring lock made by a Chinese. Its style and appearance are really not more "push-back" than imported products. I was very satisfied and installed it on the door and tried my best to promote it to relatives and friends.</p>
<p>But in less than a week, the spring pin installed on the door suddenly broke. After disassembling and examining the details, the reason was very simple; a screw inside the lock was originally broken, but after a short period of use, it came off, and the entire lock was damaged.</p>
<p>This is a very painful thing; I sincerely use domestic goods, but the crudeness and durability of domestic goods are so poor! (Although only a very small number of domestic goods are like this, these black sheep will eventually implicate the reputation of all domestic goods.)</p>
<p>But then again, this error may be mostly due to the laziness and ignorance of the workers. The factory probably wouldn't covet such a small profit and use already broken screws, but it is also unremitting in its dereliction of duty to not inspect the products and rush them to the market for sale. Little has been disappointed and wants to offer a contribution to sincere producers of domestic goods; improve the level of workers, explain the great righteousness, and do not let them neglect their duties (of course, they themselves must never produce crudely and fraudulently), and at the same time, they must strictly inspect the goods, and never allow shoddy products to fill the ranks, losing their reputation. If that is the case, then a ray of dawn for the future of domestic goods is unlimited!</p>

<h3 id="e236">The Japanese Fear the Soviet Air Force <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— Zhanlu</p>
<p>To shout the slogan "The Japanese fear the Soviet Air Force" in a crowded place, everyone would laugh their heads off. Would the Japanese fear the Soviet Air Force? If the Japanese were really afraid of the Soviet Air Force, then why did the people of Suzhou cry and scream in fear after the Japanese planes visited Wumen during the January 28th Incident, and why did they take their families away to avoid it? Ha ha! What lies are you telling?</p>
<p>The facts tell me that I'm not telling any lies. The Japanese do fear the Soviet Air Force, but this Soviet Air Force is not the soft-spoken, gentle Soviet Air Force, but the Soviet air force that flies over the heads of the Japanese. The seven characters "Soviet Air Force flies over the heads" are simplified into three characters, which is called the Soviet Air Force.</p>
<p>The Japanese have more than enough navy and army to deal with the Soviet Union, but their air force is dwarfed in comparison; this argument is often seen in Japanese newspapers, so it can be seen that the Japanese are not afraid of the Soviet sea and Soviet land, but only the Soviet Air Force. The Soviet Union saw through the Japanese fear, so the Far East Affairs Bureau issued a declaration, stating: "When the Japanese start aggression in the Far East, the Soviet Air Force is ready to resolve the most densely populated central areas of the enemy." The momentum of the Soviet Air Force is so strong that even if the Japanese are bold, they should have considerable fear.</p>
<p>This is not the Soviet Union bluffing. British female journalist Mrs. Trulamon also wrote an article saying: "The Soviet Union has an advantage in air force attacks on Japan; only because the development of the Soviet Air Force has made rapid progress in recent years, exceeding the Japanese. The shortest distance between the Soviet coastal state and Japan is only 350 miles, and it is more than enough to send the air force to attack Japan. If the Soviet Air Force uses four long-range motorized-equipped aircraft to carry out air strikes on Japanese cities from its base in Vladivostok, it would be more than enough." The arguments of foreigners are like this, so it can be seen that the Soviet Air Force really has a force that cannot be underestimated.</p>
<p>There is a very possible war between Japan and Russia; however, the first bullet must be fired by the Japanese, and it is afraid that it will not become a fact. Why? Because "the Japanese fear the Soviet Air Force."</p>
<h3 id="e237">Street Scene After the Rain <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— 愼言</p>
<p>Life is inherently full of troubles, but looking at the dictionary, in the "heart" radical, nine out of ten characters are adjectives describing worry and sorrow. From this, one can imagine! Because of this understanding, I believe with utmost sincerity that the sighs of those gentlemen who have eaten their fill of Western cuisine and sit on flushing toilets smoking cigars are also expressions of the same "life is inherently full of troubles." However, the troubles and anxieties of these gentlemen are ultimately one-sided, belonging only to the realm of the spiritual. At most, they are merely quarreling over family issues, love affairs, or matters of face. But for us poor folks, it's different. Spiritual troubles are, of course, unavoidable, and there's no need to elaborate on that here. Let me talk about the suffering the poor endure due to material lack.</p>
<p>Take the most obvious example: the street after the rain. After the rain, while the gentlemen are dressed in elegant, lightweight clothes, sitting in their brand-new automobiles or rented carriages, speeding across the smooth asphalt roads, the poor are relying on their meager material resources to fight the wind and rain on the muddy sidewalks. Those who wear raincoats, carry umbrellas, and desperately try to squeeze into the tram are considered the upper class of the poor. Next are those who have some rain gear but can't afford the fare. Then, there are those that the gentlemen cannot imagine. They have never worn leather shoes. When it rains, they go barefoot. They have never worn raincoats. When it rains, they can only use their body temperature as their sole defense against the rain. Besides that, they still have to run, sweat, and work as usual in the wind and rain.</p>
<p>When you pass by those less bustling streets after the rain – around seven or eight o'clock in the evening – your first impression is inevitably those newsboys with bare calves, wearing very tattered and dirty old clothes. Whenever a tram or bus arrives at the station, they rush out from the rain and darkness, shouting "Late Night News," "Great American Evening News" in extremely desolate tones. When the vehicle drives away, they shrink back into the darkness where they can shelter from the rain. They wipe the raindrops from their heads with their sleeves, and anxiously count the newspapers in their hands or the copper coins in their pockets, secretly worrying that the rain will ruin their sales.</p>
<p>Friend, do you have children at home? If you do, and you love them very much, then I hope you never meet these poor little souls on the streets after the rain! Because I believe that most people's hearts are made of flesh?</p>

<p>— Yan Chonglou</p>
<p>I often see news in the papers about cars running over pedestrians, and sometimes I even witness people lying bloody after being hit by cars. But this time, it happened to me.</p>
<p>The story is this: The day before yesterday, I left home, preparing to take the bus to work. But before I could get on the bus, it started moving. My hand slipped, and the wheel ran over my leg. "This time my leg is broken! …But there are still so many things waiting for me to do!…" In the instant when one of my legs completely lost sensation, that's what I was thinking.</p>
<p>The heavy wheel weighing a thousand pounds ran over my left leg. I quickly supported myself with my right leg. I checked to see if my crushed leg was still there. I really couldn’t understand how it could still be there after such high pressure.</p>
<p>But the left leg was showing a very serious injury! I struggled to get on the bus that ran me over, avoiding the gazes of the spectators who were watching as if it were a show.</p>
<p>I didn't blame the "ticket seller" and "driver" who injured me. So they complimented me as a "tough guy" and "strong one." They said it was unprecedented for someone like me to remain so calm after being run over by a wheel.</p>
<p>After arriving at the doctor's and being bandaged up, the injury gradually began to hurt! At this moment, I deeply believed in the saying: "The road is like a tiger's mouth, pedestrians have no safety!"</p>
<p>Recently, I just finished writing a novel called "Tragedy in Loneliness," but I never expected that I myself would encounter this tragic scene in quick succession.</p>

<p>— Bo Guang</p>
<p>Isn't "acting without knowing" just blindly blundering? No! It isn't!</p>
<p>Mr. Sun Yat-sen said: "The progress of humanity all begins with acting without knowing." Indeed, one can act even without knowing, as long as we can devote ourselves to hard work, exploration, and research.</p>
<p>Like Watt inventing the steam engine, Edison inventing the light bulb... they all acted without knowing.</p>
<p>Westerners say that we Chinese only know how to enjoy life. It's true, who doesn't want to enjoy life? However, enjoyment is the door to decadence. We young people should show perseverance and fight against adverse environments. We must know that only by enduring the bitterness of bitterness can we become people above people.</p>
<p>In modern society, there are too many young people indulging in opium, gambling, prostitution, or dance halls. They probably embrace the philosophy of seizing the day in their youth! Their minds are shrouded in a layer of fog. Living in a modern society with overpopulation, how can they allow themselves to be intoxicated? And some young people are unwilling to work hard, claiming that one can act without knowing? Then, are humans "born knowing"?</p>
<p>America advocates</p>
<p>that a person should not expect something for nothing. If every Chinese person can produce, then the country can certainly become strong soon.</p>
<p>"Acting without knowing" is not blindly blundering. It is the beginning of human progress. Explore! Research! I wish our young people success!</p>

<p>Chapter 19: Wanting to Leave and Yet Not Wanting to Leave, Remembering Past Events in the Same Car; Half-Crying, Half-Laughing, Leaning on the Pillow, Sick in the Remaining Autumn.</p>
<p>Although he was an old man, there was, after all, a distinction between men and women. Therefore, he casually spoke a few words and left. Huang Manying smiled and nodded at Guizhi, but said nothing. Guizhi sat down in the chair next to him, and took his arm. "What's all this affectation again?"</p>
<p>Huang Manying saw that Jiang had gone into the inner room, and gently said to him, "You really are a filial daughter-in-law, very considerate of your father-in-law's feelings. You knew he was worried, and carelessly said something wrong, causing everyone to laugh." Guizhi said, "Don't be so suspicious. Even now, I still don't know what I said wrong that made you all laugh." Huang Manying sighed and said, "Whether it was said unintentionally or intentionally, it's not a good thing for me. Like me, yesterday afternoon, when I rushed here, I was still hoping to say a few words to Xiao Tian. But I came for nothing, and just watched him leave with the main force. If I had known this would happen, I wouldn't have come yesterday. Out of sight, out of mind, I might have felt better. Today, when I go back, I'll have plenty to think about on the way." Guizhi said, "Then stay here with me for another day." Huang Manying said, "You're just being polite. Going back alone today, I'll be sad thinking about it. Going back alone tomorrow, won't I still be sad thinking about it?" Guizhi said, "If you stay with me for another day, I'll take you into the city. I also want to go to the city and have some fun." Huang Manying said, "Instead of accompanying me to the city tomorrow, why not see this good deed to the end, and accompany me to the city today?" Guizhi laughed, "It's not like you can just leave whenever you want." These words were heard by Jiang, who was inside the room. He quickly said, "Girl, that's good too. You should accompany Miss Huang to the city for a trip. It's still early today. After eating, you can go leisurely. It won't be too late." Guizhi also felt that staying at home was very annoying, and it would be good to go to the city for a day or two to get past this awkwardness, so she smiled and said nothing. (Twenty-Four)</p>

<p>— Huang Kangtun</p>
<p>Life in the South Seas</p>
<p>Having lived in the South Seas for six consecutive years, from Penang in the British Straits Settlements to Rangoon, to Medan on Dutch Sumatra; it was only one long "endless summer." In the tropics, there are no distinct seasons, and it is green all year round.</p>
<p>Looking at the vast coconut groves, orderly rubber plantations, verdant mountains, and lush green sea, the scent of bananas and the taste of durian are enough to intoxicate. The wide, smooth roads, well-maintained cities, towering golden pagodas, the domed Muslim mosques marked with a crescent, and the cube-shaped "red-haired buildings" with red tiles and green windows – all the static objects of new architecture are enough to make one envious. The dark, strong, and uninhibited "coolies" who live under the sky are enough to evoke pity. The natives who use their right hand as a knife and fork, and their left hand to wipe themselves and fall asleep, completely forgetting the world, are enough to evoke compassion. The "big bosses" who enjoy luxury and forget their ancestors are enough to evoke inner numbness. The innocent and naive overseas Chinese students who can speak several dialects are enough to evoke love. Eating ice all year round, bathing everywhere, not understanding the autumn wind, regardless of frost and hail, the life of the common people with bare arms and legs, and sarongs as trousers, is enough to make one optimistic and content, not wanting revolution. These lives in the South Seas, seen from the outside, even though the golden age of rubber and tin mines has long passed, still seem worth cherishing.</p>

<p>Returning Home</p>
<p>But if you lift the curtain slightly and take a peek inside, you'll see the blue-faced fangs of those who plunder by force, the sighs of lamentation caused by the economic downturn, the scrambling and squeezing for food and seats, the ugly faces emerging from the intensified market struggles of capitalism, and the escalating oppression of the intruders taking over. Faced with all these signs of future storms, I still acted as a cricket escaping from the crack in the giant's palm, leaping towards the old nest, humming the old tune of Mr. Pengze from 1,500 years ago, "Return, oh return!"</p>

<p>My Daughter is Yet to be Married</p>
<p>From Medan, I took the Dutch ship "Ting Nong Po" to Singapore, and then transferred to the "Jin Ma" to Hong Kong, which is truly "proletarian." Due to material limitations, I shared a steerage cabin, which was indeed crowded. Needless to say, everyone was an overseas Chinese returning home without a title. The "Jin Ma" was also a Dutch ship. The voyage from Singapore to Hong Kong is in the Chinese Sea. More than 90 percent of the passengers coming and going are Chinese. Chinese people sailing the Chinese Sea, but unable to take a Chinese ship. Of course, most of the ships in China's inland rivers still fly foreign flags, let alone when they leave the country. A fellow passenger said: "My daughter is still living with her parents, she has not yet married." The passengers in the steerage cabin were naturally mostly the real proletarian class. My berth happened to be next to the ship's railing. The passengers often urinated and defecated by the railing, and the smell was quite appetizing. All day long, the cabin was filled with the cries of children and the shouts of women, complete with musical instruments, gramophones, and hawkers shouting, fully displaying the civilization of a Beijing opera house. These entire five days and nights made you feel as if you were in a bustling metropolis, not feeling the loneliness of being on a boat at all.</p>

<p>Memories of Sea Travel</p>
<p>I remember in the winter of 1927, when I traveled from Shanghai to Penang, I took the Japanese mail ship "Hakusan Maru." At that time, it was my first time sailing. The rising and falling waves in front of me reflected the sea view with lines of green that I saw in my childhood paintings. From the snow-covered gateway of the country to the scorching green fields, I felt full of novelty. There was a realistic poem in the boat:</p>
<p>"The cold wind blows me to the hot south, taking off my fur coat and changing into white clothes; the seats are filled with people drinking ice on New Year's Day, and sweat can still be seen on the silk shirt." In the summer of 1930, I took the British ship "Ilingborough" from Penang to Rangoon, passing through the Strait of Malacca and entering the Gulf of Martaban. The ship was like a cradle, and the sea was like a round mirror. The voyage was comfortable, and nothing could be better. In the autumn of 1931, I took the "Hai Xing" ship from Rangoon back to China. The ship was small and full, and there were no extra seats on the ship's rail. Passing through the South China Sea, we happened to encounter a hurricane. It floated like autumn wind shaking leaves, and the passengers were all lying down like stiff silkworms. At that time, I sat quietly on the deck, looking at the sea level and the sky, and it was quite interesting. In the winter of that year, I took the German mail ship "Goblen" to Sumatra, passing through Manila, Hong Kong, Singapore, and arriving directly at Teluk Nibung. During the dozen days at sea, the music played on time by the waiter who also served as a band member, and the fox dance performed on the deck by two Italian girls and two red-haired boys with bare legs, still vaguely remained in my mind.</p>

<p>The gold market continues to be weak, falling again yesterday. However, the half-day market was mediocre.

Then, with the domestic market tightening, silver companies suddenly covered, Hengxing, Tongtai, Changshun, Shunli, Daxingyong, Fuyu, Zhaofengchang and others scrambled to buy, and rose to 91 yuan. The Belgian Bank sold February US dollars at 0625, and Tongtaichang sold off, retreating 2 yuan, and Qianchang, Xiangyuan, Maoyong continued to buy in, and rebounded to 91 yuan 8 jiao. The market situation was still confusing.

<h3 id="e247">Securities Settlement Date Approaching, Public Bonds Suddenly Rebound, Shorts Covering and Turning Long, Market Prices Unanimously Rising <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, the news from the Fujian situation was dull and there was no significant development. The shorts temporarily withdrew and did not dare to add more positions. The market price suddenly rebounded, as the reporter had expected. However, this kind of rebound was entirely due to the approaching settlement date and the crowded short positions. Therefore, future changes are still numerous, and it is impossible to have a smooth and steady rise. Although the news of the Fujian incident is dull, it is approaching a second brewing period, and there are many waves ahead. Currently, because it is a short-dominated market, there is bound to be a slight rebound. At the opening yesterday morning, the market sentiment rose due to the belief that the Fujian incident was isolated and the situation might not escalate. Although there were sellers, buyers poured in suddenly, with large purchases of numbers 47 and 54. Throughout the day, the opening price of the troop reduction issue rose sharply by seventy-nine cents, and the rest also rose by thirty to forty cents. However, Jin Chang rose sharply by one yuan, while the whole number six only fell by two to three cents. This was because of different hedging periods for longs and shorts, so there was a slight abnormality. In the second session, retail investors again covered their shorts, and the positions on the floor also turned long. Numbers 47 and 54 still had demand, and the market price continued to rise by thirty to fifty cents. In the afternoon, another session was made, and the market price continued to rise unanimously, with a continued increase of two to three cents to six to seven cents. As a result, the market price generally rebounded by several cents to one yuan and thirty to forty cents, with Jin Chang uniquely rising by two yuan and thirty cents, a very rapid rebound. The total turnover was 23,769,000 yuan, including 4,000 yuan in spot goods. The futures included a total of 9,640,000 yuan in salt tax, 3,190,000 yuan in troop reduction, 2,580,000 yuan in 19 Customs, and 4,665,000 yuan in 20-roll 20 Customs, with the rest ranging from tens of thousands to over one million.</p>

<p>According to a report from Sin Fung Foreign Firm, the New York stock market on the 21st was again sluggish. It opened quite firm due to commercial reports favoring the long side, favorable company dividend actions, and continued weakness of the U.S. dollar. Subsequently, due to the possibility of the government imposing a heavy tax on whiskey storage, the long side took profits, and prices loosened. As a result, gains and losses were mixed, with extreme discrepancies. French bonds were firm, and Belgian bonds fluctuated slightly. The total daily trading volume was 1.8 million shares. "Wheat" lacked new buyers, and speculators sold off due to unfavorable news from Argentina. It seemed that buying on dips was possible. "Cotton" also lacked new buyers, and the long positions seemed extremely large. This situation is a common phenomenon before a price drop. The Financial Rehabilitation Society bought gold at a price of $33.76 per tael, up one cent. The Dow Jones index is listed below:</p>

<p>The yarn market is still weak, and the Fujian situation is tense. Customers have stopped procurement, so spot sales are quite sluggish, and morale is low. However, there is a rumor that a certain association will still purchase at a limited price of 5.5 yuan this month. As a result, new sellers are scarce, and new longs are becoming increasingly cautious due to the unfavorable general trend. The market has become deadlocked. According to a partial survey, it is said that 5,000 to 6,000 bales of yarn have already been delivered this month.</p>

<p>The pre-market opening for man-made cotton was down due to poor overseas cotton market and very few spot yarn sales, coupled with a serious political situation and weak sentiment. All months fell by two to four cents. In the afternoon, a portion covered the shorts, and all months rose by one to three cents. The total daily turnover was 16,400 bales. It was found that 1,050 bales of Mei Ji were sold, 550 bales of Tong Ji, 450 bales of Sui Long, 750 bales of Shen Chang, 400 bales of Chang Feng, 950 bales of De Ji, and 600 bales of Da Chang Cheng. 1,350 bales of Da Feng were bought, 500 bales of Chun Ji, 650 bales of Rui Da, 1,000 bales of Tong He, and 350 bales of Shen Ji.

<p>The cotton market fell in the morning and rose in the afternoon. U.S. cotton rose slightly by two pounds, while gold prices continued to fall and exchange rates rose sharply. Procurement prices are trending downward, and the cotton market may fall. However, some are absorbing and not releasing, and the market is still high. As for actual demand, factories are unable to handle raw materials due to changes in the Fujian situation and sluggish yarn sales. Judging from the general trend, a large price increase in the future is unlikely.</p>

<p>The Zheng Biao (cotton) market opened lower due to poor yarn market, lackluster Indian and American cotton markets, and continued decline in gold prices. All months fell by five cents to one dime. In the afternoon, shorts covered, and all months rebounded by one to two dimes. The total daily turnover was 55,700 dan.

<p>(Tianjin Dispatch on the 21st) The trading volume of cotton yarn in this city is still not very large, and the market atmosphere is still strong. The price of 16-count Fengnian yarn bought by the Baigou gang is 192.5 yuan. The price of 16-count Sanxi yarn bought by the Wolugu gang is 186.25 yuan.

<p>After the opening of the flour market in the morning, the market situation for each month showed an initial stability followed by weakness. With the quotation of foreign wheat, Chicago had no major fluctuations, and Canada was better by one cent. Therefore, the market atmosphere was still stable at the opening. Later, due to customer longs such as the Tianjin and Shandong gangs, they gradually withdrew in each session. Even general amateur longs also stopped due to the excessive rise in the market and unanimously closed positions, causing the market to loosen. When the afternoon session opened, the selling price of spot flour in Tianjin also reported a fall of six cents, opening at 2.56 yuan. Therefore, the gang sold off in large quantities, and floating longs in the market also stepped out of the market, and the market atmosphere returned to weakness. According to the current situation, most of them are following the appetite of actual sales, but the future activities of foreign wheat may still be inevitable. As a result, this month fell by 3.5 cents compared to the previous day, December fell by 2.75 cents, January fell by 2.5 cents, February fell by 2.75 cents, March fell by 3 cents, and April fell by 2.25 cents.</p>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market generally showed an initial stability followed by weakness in each month. With little fluctuation in the quotation of foreign wheat and the sharp rise in recent days, a temporary hovering was inevitable. Due to profit-taking by longs, they stepped out of the market. New buyers were afraid of cheap foreign wheat because the forward price had reached 20 cents outside, and they would be greatly suppressed. Therefore, buying interest was flat, and it was difficult for prices to rise. In the afternoon sessions, the flour market had fallen, and morale was soft. Each month fell by two to three cents. However, because of the spot situation in the near term, and the approaching delivery date, it should be able to stand firm. As a result, this month fell by a fraction of a cent, December to March each fell by three cents, and April fell by two cents. The spot market was strong because the standard for special high-quality goods had reached 20 cents outside. Wuhe Yaowan wheat opened at 4.2 yuan, Suzhou wheat at 4.15 yuan, Nanjing wheat at 4 yuan, and Heqiao wheat at 3.89 yuan. Xin Da handled 1,300 bags, and Fuxin handled 1,300 bags, it is said.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) The source of goods was similar to before, with a total of more than 30 late rice boats arriving at various customer groups (more than 5,000 piculs), and more than 20 boats of thick粳 and Du Yang rice (2,000-3,000 piculs). The stocks in Pudong were also thin due to strong sales in recent days. Therefore, from the start of the initial market, seeing that the arrival of goods was relatively scarce, customer groups arrived in succession, and sellers shouted high prices. Later, Tianjin, Qingdao and other gangs successively made offers, and the situation was quite lively, seemingly rising rapidly. As a result, a total of 4,000 to 5,000 bags of Qingjiao, Songjiang, and Sifeng late rice were purchased. The market situation was still difficult to loosen due to customer demand, so the market price only rose slightly. As for the local demand, it was still flat, and the arrival of regular gang Jiangsu, Tong, Nangang and other 粳 rice was also scarce. Therefore, buyers were making bids, and the market situation continued to be tight, slightly higher by several cents to a dime. Foreign pointed rice also followed suit, rising by a few cents. Du pointed rice remained stable. Yin Yuan winery gang had good demand, and the market outlook continued to be strong.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) The arrival of goods from various roads in Hexia (downstream of the river) was about 56 or 57. The sales demand for various types of rice in the market still did not improve. The market price of new 粳, early thin rice was slightly soft by a few cents. The price of broken 粳, Yangbu 客秈 rice remained stable. Bai Yuan and Yin Yuan were strong.</p>

<p>Yesterday's market for 客秈 rice, because the Fuzhou and Quanzhou gangs completely stopped purchasing, morale was weak, and the market trended downward, with prices falling by one dime and a few cents. This street had no intention to purchase 秈 rice, because the source of various rice types in Hexia was very strong, and the prices were also low. Only 330 bags of Wuhu Ji Yuan rice were purchased throughout the day, at a price of 8.1 yuan to 7.92 yuan. However, the digestion of various grains in Beiyang (northern ports) has been very active in recent days. They have purchased a lot of flour in the market for several consecutive days. Yesterday, taking advantage of the low rice prices, they took the opportunity to purchase 500 bags of Jiangbei Ji 秈 rice at a price of 6.8 yuan. The Xinghua gang purchased 75 bags of Jiangxi Ji late rice at a price of 7.6 yuan, with prices lower than the previous day by nearly a dime.</p>

<p>The sales markets for mung beans are mainly Yantai in North China and Minyue in South China. The mainland and this street can also account for one-fourth of the sales volume. Therefore, the development capacity of mung beans has been reduced by the influence of the Yantai gang's own transportation. It relies on South China, but sales demand has also decreased. Now it is also affected by the Fujian incident. The so-called small foreign merchants in Xiaoluson, etc., mainly purchase high vegetable mung beans, but they cannot be linked. The market atmosphere has been stagnant for a long time. Yesterday, the market saw the first transaction of 100 bags of Ming mung beans in Guandian, with the price opening at 4.77 yuan, and the market price was cut by three or four cents. It is now heard that there are still three or four thousand bags in inventory.</p>

<p>Yesterday the sugar market trend gradually saw a rise in color. The Public Association designated the price of number 24 coarse granulated white ordinary goods up by five cents, with the designated price at 20.2 yuan. The market price of medium granulated white was 19.9 yuan. Because the inventory of Dutch red sugar was not much, sellers were tight-handed. For example, BDA mark was priced at 15.7 yuan, and high-quality goods were priced at 16 yuan. Taikoo Sugar B mark was priced at 20.55 yuan, unchanged. This factory's cotton white sugar fell by five cents again, and Zhonghua Guohua Zhenji No. 1 all opened at 18.95 yuan, with the rest following suit. Several thousand bags of new Chao Qing continued to arrive and were immediately offered for sale at 22 bags, with the price being 15.5 yuan (original price). Chen Chaoqing opened a hundred or so bags, with the price being 15.5 yuan, followed by 14.4 yuan. Due to each number's arbitrary actions, they sold off mutual holdings of sliced green sugar, resulting in a fluctuation of opening prices reaching one yuan. It was found that the previous disk was 12 yuan. Yesterday, the Chao gang first released 11.5 yuan, opening 90+ pieces. The Guang gang followed, opening 11 yuan, for a total of more than 900 boxes. The Hong Kong gang finally dumped 10.5 yuan, for a total of 360+ boxes. The numbered goods were immediately cleared. This drop was neither due to land prices nor due to excessive goods. It was entirely due to the effect of opinions. The later market may recover slightly, which is also unknown.</p>

<p>This year's winter aquatic product of orchid seeds, the quality and color are all good, and the price is also cheap. However, because sales are not very smooth, the trend is flat and weak. Yesterday, according to a letter from Zhangzhou, the inventory of yellow, bright, high-quality goods has gradually become scarce recently, and there is a sign of tightening prices.

<p>Single-sided Kai Shui Mi Yu (open water rice rain) cloth was very active yesterday. 4026 old-brand goods were especially popular because the city's inventory was not much, and the supply from foreign firms was limited. The industry's sentiment was upward, and selling prices tended to increase. Yesterday, 4026 first-class goods were offered at 5.15 yuan, and 2220 second-class goods were at 4.8 yuan.

<p>Since the change in the Fujian situation, the Fujian gang telegraphed to stop hardware trading, and the Wenzhou gang also telegraphed to temporarily stop import. Therefore, the hardware market yesterday showed an even more wooden atmosphere. As a result, the market price had the appearance of being strong outside but weak inside. For example, export goods of this factory's nails were estimated at 7.65 yuan, down another five cents from before, while the market price in this street still opened at 7.2 yuan. Only more than 300 barrels were traded. 7.5 to 10-cent English steel plates were slightly offered, with prices at 8.3 yuan (7.5 cents) and 7.9 yuan (18). The incoming goods of bamboo-joint steel bars were abundant, and the market price was looser than before. The unified price was 119 yuan, and variegated colors were in the range of 125 yuan to 130 yuan. 90-pound U.S. tinplate was very thin in stock, and the market price could reach 16.3 yuan per dan, up one dime from before. In addition, various colors were very mediocre.</p>

<h3 id="e265">About Chen Meigong <a href="#e265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>— Yin Chuan</p>
<p>Chen Meigong (Jiru) published more than 200 types of "Bao Yan Tang Secret Books" in his life, and his contribution to culture can be said to be not small. And he took these "secret books" very seriously and painstakingly proofread and printed them, saying, "I got ancient books," proofread and paid for copying, proofread again after copying, paid for engraving, proofread again after engraving, paid for printing, and proofread again after printing, "but there are still two or three mistakes." (Yanqi You Shi) The difficulty of proofreading and Meigong's meticulousness can be seen from this. According to his books, this man's life was probably quite leisurely. In summer, when he had nothing to do, he edited ancient stories about dispelling summer heat into the "Xiaoxia Bu"; in winter, when he had nothing to do, he edited old stories about dispelling cold during the stove to create "Pi Han Bu." When he got malaria, he delved into ancient books and collected tiger stories in order to ward off malaria, and printed a booklet of "Hu Hui." It's no wonder that he was proud of himself as a "little fairy" in "Taiping Qinghua." He also wrote many books himself, and had a great influence on the development of prose in the late Ming Dynasty. According to the "Bao Yan Tang Secret Book," there were 15 kinds of notes, with 47 volumes; and the "Siku Quanshu Zongmu" (Complete Library in Four Sections) recorded even more than this number. In addition to those related to history, anecdotes, records of events, and records of people, his notes are mostly clear and beautiful, and are "fresh essays" as Mr. Yu Dafu said. Such as a section in "Kuang Fu Zhi Yan" (Words of a Madman):</p>
<p>Suo Kai Fu's poem says: "For you, vulgar people are dressed, and true interests should be lacking." Lu Wenjing's poem says: "Heavenly Flower Temple on Lake Hejia, every window faces the water; no need to close the door to guard against vulgar guests, how many people love idleness?" When I opened the door in the mountains, I used Suo's poem to thank the guests; when the guests came, I used Lu's poem to comfort myself.</p>
<p>Although it is an article that seems like a "small display", a few words have already reflected the life trend of a pastoral poet. This man loved mountain life extremely, and he lived that way. The reason why he could live like this was probably because his life was very affluent. So, he had money to buy books, money to print books, and he lived in the mountains without any worries. In "Yanqi You Shi" (Secluded Affairs of Rock Dwelling), Meigong has two sections writing about mountain birds and mountain neighbors: Mountain birds often start five times at five watch, called reporting the watch, which is the true sound of the mountains. I remember living under Little Kunshan in the past, when the plum rain had just cleared, and the guests were flying goblets. They happened to hear the court, and asked to drink in moderation, so they inscribed a couplet saying: "Flower branches send off guests, frogs urge drums; bamboo sound is noisy in the forest, birds report the watch", which can be called a true record of mountain history.</p>
<p>I once passed a mountain neighbor who was old and loved flowers. Red and purple reflected the house, and he was playing with his grandchildren under the sun. People no longer knew the hustle and bustle of city residence and carriages, let alone the dusty evils of the capital. I gave him a poem: "A small door opens under the pine, famous medicines are planted around the field in front of the hall, the old man hugs his grandson instead of hugging the jar, just wanting to water the flowers as the mountain rain comes."</p>
<p>Here, one can see how Meigong tasted the secluded fun of mountain life and accepted it with a poetic mood when living in the mountains; at the same time, one can also see Meigong's anti-metropolitan mentality and anti-bureaucratic tendency at that time. There are many such notes, so I won't cite them anymore: However, Meigong's life, thoughts, and fresh essay style can already be overviewed. As for the criticism of this life tendency, I don't want to say anything, leave it to the readers. The main works of Meigong's miscellaneous writings include "Jianwen Lu" (Records of What I Have Seen and Heard), "Taiping Qinghua" (Pure Talk in Peaceful Times), "Kuang Fu Zhi Yan" (Words of a Madman), "Zhenzhu Chuan" (Pearl Boat), and "Du Shu Jing" (Mirror for Reading), several kinds.</p>
<h3 id="e266">Dog <a href="#e266" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c266" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">266</a></h3>
<p>— Liao Botan</p>
<p>Mr. Shu's relatives, friends, and neighbors all know that there is a dog in his family, whose name is Senping, which is a very good dog丨Once, and it occupied a corner of the XX pictorial.</p>
<p>Senping's life is really leisurely. Mr. Shu has a share in the things he likes to eat; when Mrs. Shu goes shopping, it will follow behind, shaking and sniffing; Miss Shu's hands, which have been sung by "poets with long hair," will stroke its back; at night, it sleeps on the sofa, and if it's cold, it's covered with velvet; if it's hot, it sleeps in the pavilion surrounded by flowers. If it's happy, it may sleep on the foreign cement railing by the pool.</p>
<p>No one in the Shu family doesn't love it. Although the servants are a little jealous, they really love it.</p>
<p>"It's so smart! It's so agile!" In the garden, Miss Shu throws a glove, and it immediately picks it up and runs to Miss Shu's side like flying, standing side by side, isn't the tail wagging enough? Throw it immediately, run immediately, you just throw it, he just runs; when you are tired of it, it may not be tired; whether it is deliberately pretending not to be tired, that is beyond my knowledge.</p>
<p>Once, a thief broke into the Shu family, just when it was late at night and quiet. Who said this was not a good opportunity to be a thief? But it was caught! Strange, isn't it? It turned out to be all Senping's strength!</p>
<p>Because of this, each of the Shu family's servants was severely reprimanded: "What do I raise you for? I raise you to eat! Do you want my meals to turn into mold? If it weren't for my Senping, it would be ruined! It's a waste of people growing so big, not as good as a beast! If you are still so careless in the future, you will be greeting your dog ribs!"</p>
<p>"The master didn't tell us to work the night shift." Sun Han said. Pa pa pa... "Dare you argue with me?"... Pa pa...</p>
<p>Really, this kid has no sense of propriety! The rest of the servants all said it was good to beat him.</p>
<p>Last year, a friend of Mr. Shu, Mr. Mo, announced a lucrative errand somewhere. Mr. Mo also loved Senping. Mr. Shu hurriedly cut his love and personally sent Senping to please Mr. Mo.</p>
<p>But Mr. Mo said coldly: "Thank you! Thank you!" He insisted on not wanting it.</p>
<p>Mr. Shu saw that Mr. Mo really didn't want it. He had no choice but to bring it back! After careful consideration, he quickly sealed hundreds of "travel expenses" and sent them over, and Mr. Mo accepted them. Of course, he also went through the process of declining! Only then did Mr. Shu understand that dogs are ultimately not as good as lace, and it paved the way for Senping's subsequent appearance under the table.</p>
<p>One day, the Shu ladies were having lunch, and a meat bone fell from the table. Originally, Senping would not eat bones, but now, it had to make do with it.</p>
<p>Suddenly, with a "Xiao" sound, a pair of black leather shoes started, and Senping fell beside Miss Shu's legs; Miss Shu laughed and kicked it, and it fell beside the sister-in-law's legs; when Senping knew it was bad, all sixteen feet moved! Help! "Xiao Xiao..." The more it cried, the more "It's so fun!" It finally managed to "break out."</p>
<p>But Defu, the one who added rice next to him, also wanted to join in the fun and win some laughter, so he quickly showed off his skills, chasing from the front of the house to the back, from the back of the house, the back chasing to the front, still Mrs. Shu couldn't bear to watch and stopped him.</p>
<p>Miss丨 laughs! Madam丨 laughs丨 Everyone丨 laughs! Laugh laugh...</p>
<p>"Xiao Xiao Xiao..."</p>
<p>After that, Senping became thinner day by day... and fell ill. "If we don't drive it out, we are afraid of catching cholera?" said the foreign student, the fourth young master. What happened to Senping afterwards? Heaven knows!</p>

<p>— Written by Lermontov, translated by Mu Mutian</p>
<p>A lonely sail in the blue sea fog gleams white... What does it seek in that distant land? What has it left behind in its homeland? The waves rage, the wind howls, the masts bend, creak, and lament. Ah! It is not pursuing happiness. Nor is it running away for happiness. Looking down, the water is brighter than the blue sky, and above is the golden sunlight, but for the traitor, it hopes for a storm, as if there is peace only in the storm.</p>

<p>Another stab, and the "target" is still me. This is a bit beyond "coincidence." But of course, it's well-intentioned, supposedly to "remind" me; damn, why should I "make a fuss"?</p>
<p>But good intentions alone might not be enough. The issue, I hear, is "whether there are authors who only want to provoke youth with lies." It sounds as if I don't acknowledge that there are people who lie and deceive. Perhaps this is what they call "a point I've overlooked," which should be "reminded" to me. But in my essay, "The Needs of Youth," I remember having written these sentences:</p>
<p>"Moreover, many recent predecessors are using new things to replace red and blue mandarin hats as tools for seduction and deception, drawing young people into their bags one by one, teaching them to worship, teaching them to shout slogans. After using them, they arbitrarily play with them, mock them, and ridicule them.</p>
<p>"There are also those who disregard the needs of the times, molding young people into figures like themselves, moving them with sweet words, tempting them with great profits. Some become Westernized, others become nationalized. Once they themselves are lifted to the clouds, they trample on the young people beneath their feet one by one."</p>
<p>I clearly acknowledge that there are predecessors who lie and deceive young people, which is why I found it strange that anyone would consider lies as a "need of youth." However, the essayist is intent on "reminding" me, so they erased the aforementioned words and insisted on treating me as if I had "overlooked this point." Now (actually, a long time ago), I can "address this point."</p>
<p>As for "provoking youth," I have never, and will never, treat provocation as a crime to slander others with. I wrote "The Provocative Nature of Literature" to show that provocation is provocation, and lies are lies, and the two should not be confused. But the essayist insists that provocation is lying, and hates that I haven't condemned provocation harshly enough. Thus, this is also "a point I've overlooked."</p>
<p>Actually, there was no need for this regret. Because it's already in the essayist's famous piece. First, lies are equated with provocation, and then it is asserted that provocation must use false emotions. (Are there also false emotions in a famous piece without provocation [?]?) Therefore, this is deceiving youth (?), therefore, this is unacceptable (?), therefore, it is severely condemned. But this time, they deny ever having troubled provocation. And me? I shouldn't "be indignant" nor should I "exert myself."</p>
<p>Conversely, being "too concise" is also not good.</p>
<p>Thighs must be snowy white, and breasts must quiver. Not only is there no suspicion of anesthetizing youth, but it's probably also greatly beneficial to youth. Isn't it?</p>

<p>— By Enger Poulsen, Translated by Li Weike</p>
<p>The Dutchman told him how four important coffee shops in the city were willing to give him publicity, and that two local newspapers had agreed to run his advertisements, as long as he sent the editors some medicine.</p>
<p>After a long silence, Malosco asked his brother Jeanne whether he had definitively received the inheritance. He then asked two or three vague questions about the matter. His suspicious concern for Pierre made him resent the donor's partiality. And Pierre thought he understood what he was thinking and guessing, that in that shifting gaze and hesitant tone, he heard the words that were on his lips but unsaid. Words that he would never utter, because he was so cautious, so timid, so cunning.</p>
<p>He no longer doubted it. The old man was thinking, "You shouldn't have let him accept this inheritance. It will damage your mother's reputation." He even thought that Jeanne might be Marisa's son. He must think that! How could he not think that, since it appeared so real, so possible, so obvious? Hadn't Pierre been struggling for three days with all his strength, with all his meticulous thoughts, trying to deceive his own reason, trying to overcome this terrible doubt? Suddenly, he needed to think, to discuss, to boldly and courageously examine this seemingly possible and absurd thing all by himself, so urgently. Without even drinking his glass of raspberry wine, he stood up, shook hands with the very surprised pharmacist, and disappeared again into the fog on the street.</p>
<p>He thought to himself, "Why did Marisa leave all his property to Jeanne?"</p>
<p>It was no longer jealousy that drove him to pursue this matter. It was no longer that slightly base, natural envy that he had been trying to restrain for three days. It was the fear of an inappropriate matter, the fear of even believing that his brother Jeanne was this man's son.</p>
<p>No, he didn't believe it. He couldn't even bring himself to ask this criminal question. But the slight, impossible doubt in his heart had to be completely and definitively cast away. He had to understand this matter thoroughly and be certain of it. He had to have absolute security in his heart, because he only loved his mother in this world.</p>
<p>As he wandered alone in the dark night, he wanted to conduct a detailed investigation in his memory, in his reason, from which he could obtain the shining truth. Then it would all be over. He would never think about it again. He could go to sleep in peace.</p>
<p>He thought, "Come, let's first examine the facts. Then I will recall everything I know about him, his attitude towards my brother and me. I can search for all the reasons why he developed this partiality... He saw Jeanne born? Yes, but he knew me first. If he had a silent and cautious opinion of my mother, then he should have liked me more, because thanks to me, thanks to my scarlet fever, he became a close friend of my parents. So, logically speaking, when he watched my brother grow up, unless he felt an attraction, an instinctive preference for him, he should have chosen me and been more passionate towards me."</p>

<h3 id="e271">Dissenting Opinion on the Suspension of the Nobel Peace Prize <a href="#e271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>— Wei Ba</p>
<p>Nobel, who started by inventing dynamite, in order to repent for the evils he had created during his lifetime, left a will after his death to have all his property organized into a custodial committee to establish prizes for physics, chemistry, and literature. Each year, the committee selects individuals from around the world who have contributed to these sciences and awards them. Among these is a "Peace Prize," which he specifically designated to be awarded to individuals who have contributed to the world peace movement, to atone for his creation of deadly weapons. Past winners, such as Wilson and Briand, were all important figures on the international political stage, famous for supporting peace.</p>
<p>It was rumored that this year's prize might be awarded to Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov, for concluding "non-aggression treaties" everywhere. But according to a recent Havas News Agency dispatch, the Nobel Prize Committee has decided to "suspend the award" for this year's "Peace Prize." Newspaper headlines even used phrases like "A Sign of a World Without Peace" (see the newspaper dated the 16th of this month). To those who care about world peace, especially the Chinese people who are infused with a love of peace, this is an jarring piece of news!</p>
<p>It is undeniable that European, American, and Far Eastern countries are actively preparing for war, but it is not true that the entire world of 1.6 billion people has no one who wants to preserve the word "peace" just because of the bellicose nature of a few powerful countries.</p>
<p>I won't mention others here. Just speaking of our esteemed Republic of China's former Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, General Zhang, is enough to qualify for a hundred Peace Prizes. Ask anyone, past peace talks were nothing more than signing a document and stipulating a few treaties, becoming nothing more than empty talk on paper. How could it be like our young master's "plan to safeguard peace in the Far East," single-handedly presenting the land of the four northeastern provinces? Although he is now traveling overseas, his contribution is international and even more substantial than the "Pan-European Alliance," etc. of the Briand generation, and should not be obscured. If the representative of the non-resistance policy of "give him whatever he wants" cannot win the reputation of peace and a small prize, then the word "peace" should be permanently removed from dictionaries. Therefore, I specifically raise an objection. This year's Peace Prize should be awarded to our young marshal to boost his morale and dispel all doubts.</p>
<p>(I would like to add that this is of course one of the "international" public opinions and is definitely not because I am also Chinese and hold a feeling of "sharing in the honor.")</p>
<h3 id="e272">Good Neighbor <a href="#e272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Qin</p>
<p>My neighbor recently installed a radio, so my ears have also benefited, spending days and nights amidst the noise disturbances.</p>
<p>Now, let me talk about the "gospel" that flies from outside the wall every morning and evening.</p>
<p>In the morning. When you are still asleep in your quilt, you hear the "Diamond Sutra." The sound of the wooden fish, coming through the impenetrable cracks in the wall, goes straight to your pillow. Sometimes it is one person chanting in a drawn-out voice, sometimes it is a chorus of voices making a racket, plus bells, drums, cymbals, making your head spin, and you don't know how many bald monks are messing around at whose radio station. And the time is particularly long, continuing for about an hour, forcing you to get up. After the sutras are recited, what follows are strangely pitched, lifeless "rock-a-bye, baby needs to sleep..."-type baby songs. Songs that make wide-awake people feel discouraged, and confused people just keep sleeping. After about one or two songs, it's already eight or nine o'clock, and I escape from the cage to my place of work. I don't know what they sing after that.</p>
<p>But once evening comes, your ear's good fortune also comes. Because from this time to sleep, the time is longer, so you hear more programs. But when you talk about it in detail, it's also very simple. It's Peking opera, Shanghai opera, Shanghai opera, Peking opera, weeping for Wonderful Root Uncle, weeping for Sun Yat-sen, weeping for Wang Wuneng, etc. The art of weeping is appreciated the most, and it gives me the least good feeling. The next most annoying are the Shanghai opera, which is like the murmurings of a sleep talker, and the Jiangbei tune's "Ah, my Third Brother..." of Capturing Zhang Sanlang as they are about to fall asleep. Peking opera initially gives a sense of clarity for one or two sentences, but if you continue to shout for an hour or half an hour, it will also give you a headache.</p>
<p>So, listening to chanting in the morning and crying in the evening is like taking a class, and I have been in class for more than a week. Although his family hasn't gotten tired of it, I have a bit of a headache.</p>
<p>Logically speaking, since his family turns on the radio, I have no right to listen, but space cannot be separated, so I have to listen as an obligation. Morning and evening are originally the time I write, but now, with such a sad and happy, cymbal and drum-filled racket, I have to put down my pen. There are only two ways to deal with it: one is to dive into the quilt and bury my head to avoid hearing any sound; the other is to run to a friend's house to talk, implementing an escape policy. As a result, both are often used, that is, first going to a friend's house to chat, chatting until late at night before returning to sleep. But time is wasted, it's really "a mute eating coptis, an unspeakable bitterness." Who do I settle this bill of losses with? If this continues, I really have to move.</p>
<p>What I don't understand is how people's hearing can be so different. Mencius said, "The ears are the same in hearing sounds." I'm afraid that's not the truth, is it? Secondly, talking about appreciation, there are so many kinds of sounds, yet they are willing to appreciate chanting and crying. It can really be said to be the ultimate in boredom. This is probably the so-called "Shanghai air"! The radio is a weapon of civilization, the crystallization of science, but it is so abused by the Chinese to spread the most superstitious chanting rituals, it cannot be said to be a strange encounter. I don't know what Marconi, the inventor of the radio, would think if he saw this phenomenon in China in the future, I would like to ask him if I have the opportunity. (End)</p>
<h3 id="e273">"Drizzle" and Others <a href="#e273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>— Li Zhai</p>
<p>Not long ago, the Nanjing Municipal Government issued an order to ban two songs: "Drizzle" and "Sister, I Love You." Then, the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, following an order from the Municipal Government approving the Ministry of Interior's consultation, banned "supernatural, obscene, and vulgar picture books and paintings," that is, comic strips. Although both of these are considered "trivial matters" by many adults, gentlemen, or modern men and women, they are indeed the current government's "debut" in caring about "public morals" and "popular art." So, regardless of which aspect, it is worth "discussing" it.</p>
<p>The "reason" for the Nanjing Municipal Government to ban "Drizzle" and "Sister, I Love You" was to "maintain public morals." I am not a "loyal comrade" of "Drizzle," so I have no intention of talking nonsense here to "defend" it. However, this ban made me think of two points:</p>
<p>First, "Drizzle" and its kind do indeed have reasons to lose their space and time, but "public morals" is not one of them. Because the meaning, interpretation, and function of so-called "public morals" are all controversial and problematic. What's more, the degree to which certain new nobles or "old heroes" lavish praise on "national opera" and special domestic goods, as well as a large number of men wearing badges and grabbing guns, often gather to watch plays in the Confucius Temple, support "singing stars," and shout praises in strange voices, is more relevant to "public morals" and should be banned more than "Drizzle." So, attacking "Drizzle" with the arrow of "public morals" means that "Drizzle" has no shield to "resist."</p>
<p>Second, before "Drizzle" was born, songs like "Playing Dominoes," "Si Zhou Tunes," and "Meng Jiangnu" had been circulating in many provinces for more than ten years, becoming household names and almost becoming the "national anthem" of the lower-middle class. When "Drizzle" became popular domestically, those songs gradually declined due to "being out of date." But what is "Drizzle?" In terms of rhythm, it is a wearying, decadent sound. If it is true that "song is the voice of the heart," then "Drizzle" is precisely a reflection of the spiritual life of a declining social class that combines "non-resistance" and "national livestock"! In terms of content, it is exactly a self-confession of the soul of a living corpse, ignorant and confused, without any life force. The fact that this kind of song has gained a wide market in China shows that the decadent mood of the leisurely class in China, which is moving further and further away from sunset, is precisely being touched by the heartstrings of our "composers." Leaving aside all the strange theories of "public morals," I believe that before the great era of "Roar, China!" arrives, "Drizzle" and its kind should of course be abandoned in the most easily forgotten places. However, we must never use the "national livestock" method of "eating corn bread or cornmeal is too unsanitary, let's just fast," only passively opposing "Drizzle" and not actively paying attention to creating any substitutes. Therefore, creating and composing a batch of songs with rich content, beautiful form, and sonorous rhythms to replace the decadent sounds of "Drizzle" and its kind is one of the key tasks of today's progressive writers, especially musicians.</p>
<p>We have no objection to the banning of comic strips, but the problem is the same as with "Drizzle": what to replace them with? The "national operas" such as The Peng Gong Case, which are twenty volumes long, The Civet Cat Swaps the Prince, The Investiture of the Gods, etc., the "martial arts classics" such as The True Story of Iron Shirt and The Secret of Zhang Sanfeng's Elixir Refining, the retrograde culture of honoring Confucius and restoring the old order, and the comic strips discussed here... are all based on the ruins of Chinese feudal society. We should not only negatively deny these remnants of feudal culture, but we must also have a positive "effort to pull out the flag and change the banner like Zhao." Otherwise, under the actual needs of the spiritual life of the social masses, simply prohibiting contact with certain paintings or songbooks and not having corresponding things to replace them will result in all prohibitions and inspections becoming empty talk. The constant full houses of various sequential operas and the fact that comic strips do not diminish in popularity due to a single order prohibiting them are clear evidence.</p>

<p>When the preparatory bell rang, there were only a few students in the classroom. There were quite a few hovering at the classroom door, and I don't know what they were busy with.</p>
<p>"He didn't come!" Old Chen said, standing at the classroom door with a book in his hand.</p>
<p>"He didn't come? Even better."</p>
<p>"No, I just saw him come."</p>
<p>"Anyway, that Mr. Liu rarely calls the roll."</p>
<p>"Isn't it the same as running after being called?"</p>
<p>"Then, hey! Old Zhang, mark me present."</p>
<p>"Mark me present, Old Li..."</p>
<p>A bunch of students, moving their hands and feet, playing and laughing, seemed to have discussed the result. A few people walked into the classroom and chose seats near the door. The rest winked at each other for a while, danced their feet, played a symphony, and left the classroom.</p>
<p>"Ding, ding, ding..."</p>
<p>There were still not many students in the classroom. Mr. Liu, wearing glasses with a thousand degrees of nearsightedness, walked onto the podium with a doctoral bag, looked at the students as usual, and took out the roll call list.</p>
<p>"Mr. Liu, don't call the roll, it saves time."</p>
<p>"No, there are very few people today."</p>
<p>"Mr. Liu, there are not many people anyway!"</p>
<p>"Wang XX..." Today he ignored the students' mischief</p>
<h3 id="e275">Contemporary Celebrity Paintings and Calligraphy <a href="#e275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>Fang Ruo, styled Yaoyu, is a native of Dinghai, Zhejiang, and is skilled in appreciation and collection.</p>
<p>Alright!</p>
<p>"Here!"</p>
<p>"Zhang XX..."</p>
<p>"His nose almost rubbed on the roll, and his right-hand pencil added a vertical line next to each person's name. As a result, most of them were present.</p>
<p>"Mr. Liu, why didn't you call my name?" A student suddenly shouted.</p>
<p>"What's your name?"</p>
<p>"..." He didn't say anything, but walked onto the podium and searched for his name on the roll with Mr. Liu. At this opportunity, in an instant, "giggle giggle" several students sneaked away. "Oh, got it," he found it, "Present, Mr. Liu, allow me to go out to pee, giggle giggle" Another one left. Mr. Liu only turned his head and glanced at him.</p>
<p>There were only a few people left in the classroom; the two girls in front were arguing over a photo of a male classmate. There was also a girl on the left, shy and angry, blushing and rolling her eyes at them. Seven or eight male students in the back were reading newspapers, reading novels, and one was writing a love letter. Some were dozing off. In short, no one was listening to what Mr. Liu was burying his head and talking about.</p>
<p>"Sasha, Sasha!" The minute hand on the watch turned past zero and pointed to the word "six".</p>
<p>"Mr. Liu, let's end the class, there are too few people."</p>
<p>"..." He just ignored it and continued to talk with his head shaking seriously.</p>
<p>"Chichi chi!" The soles of the leather shoes rubbed against the terrazzo floor for a while and finally succeeded, leaving class early.</p>
<h3 id="e276">Eating, Pooping, and Others <a href="#e276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>— Guang Han</p>
<p>Almighty God is only almighty, and is ultimately not perfect enough to be called "perfect." Having created humans, He deliberately arranged for you to have organs and the like, so mortals always have to eat. Because food cannot be completely transformed into blood, eating inevitably leads to pooping. How troublesome! Human life begins with eating and pooping, and ends in a grand finale of eating and pooping!</p>
<p>Humans, to put it grandly, are the masters of the world, conquering everything, dominating everything, and creating everything. To put it modestly, they are just a digestive system that can only manage the function of eating and pooping. The life force is very weak. An earthworm is cut in two, and soon it will turn into two worms, wriggling. Humans, on the other hand, are sometimes hit by half a brick falling from the eaves and immediately "return to the underworld"!</p>
<p>Physiologists tell us that eating and pooping are human instincts, innate, and you can do it as soon as you leave your mother's womb. This gives us a lot of convenience, no need to learn again. It is hateful that God only endows people with the skills of eating and pooping. As for the effort of "getting from poop to mouth," they still have to spend some effort to practice on their own. People are the same, and although there is not much difference in the ability to eat and poop, there are great differences in the means of obtaining food. Some can almost "gain without labor," some must "gain after labor," and some "labor but still find it difficult to gain." Gaining without labor is obviously "getting what one should not get." Gaining after labor is considered "gaining the right way." As for laboring but still finding it difficult to gain, this is undoubtedly "being exploited." Therefore, the world is not fair!</p>
<p>If society had "equal food for everyone" or "less people and more food," that would be great, but things are just the opposite, "more people and less food," that's terrible! Because there are more people and less food, and there is not enough to distribute, there will inevitably be a dispute. The outcome of the dispute is to determine the winner. The winner will naturally have something to eat, and the loser should starve! Who told you not to work hard? Some people will talk a lot about the principles, saying that "survival is a God-given privilege," and everyone should have food to eat. How can you allow you to fight and plunder and make the world what it is? This can only ask "you ask the heavens about this"!</p>
<p>Regarding less food and more people, those who like to stir up trouble speculate that it is either insufficient production or that some strong and barbaric people have snatched too much. Unfounded words are unscientific, and this guess is indeed wrong. Isn't current social production in the middle of an excess, what's insufficient about it? It is also like having a few injustices if it is falsely accused of being seized by people, and it is more appropriate to blame the excessive increase in population.</p>
<p>It is easy to eat, but difficult to get food. This is the scene before our eyes. Since no one has yet provided a good solution, comrades waiting for food can only tighten their belts! Anyway, eating less means pooping less, the gains and losses are offset, why not do it?</p>
<p>In addition to eating, there is also one thing that is equally important, and that is sex. If people have no food to eat, of course, they cannot live. Lacking sexual harmony also makes it difficult to live. As for the function of food and sex, in addition to maintaining the life of individuals and continuing the survival of the race, they also have great help for all cultures. The genes of people creating culture are mostly based on these two behaviors. But from another perspective, the occurrence of various evils in society is nothing more than what is caused by this activity.</p>

<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>is a reflection of the spiritual life of a declining social class that combines "non-resistance" and "national livestock"! In terms of content, it is exactly a self-confession of the soul of a living corpse, ignorant and confused, without any life force. The fact that this kind of song has gained a wide market in China shows that the decadent mood of the leisurely class in China, which is moving further and further away from sunset, is precisely being touched by the heartstrings of our "composers." Leaving aside all the strange theories of "public morals," I believe that before the great era of "Roar, China!" arrives, "Drizzle" and its kind should of course be abandoned in the most easily forgotten places. However, we must never use the "national livestock" method of "eating corn bread or cornmeal is too unsanitary, let's just fast," only passively opposing "Drizzle" and not actively paying attention to creating any substitutes. Therefore, creating and composing a batch of songs with rich content, beautiful form, and sonorous rhythms to replace the decadent sounds of "Drizzle" and its kind is one of the key tasks of today's progressive writers, especially musicians.</p>
<p>We have no objection to the banning of comic strips, but the problem is the same as with "Drizzle": what to replace them with? The "national operas" such as The Peng Gong Case, which are twenty volumes long, The Civet Cat Swaps the Prince, The Investiture of the Gods, etc., the "martial arts classics" such as The True Story of Iron Shirt and The Secret of Zhang Sanfeng's Elixir Refining, the retrograde culture of honoring Confucius and restoring the old order, and the comic strips discussed here... are all based on the ruins of Chinese feudal society. We should not only negatively deny these remnants of feudal culture, but we must also have a positive "effort to pull out the flag and change the banner like Zhao." Otherwise, under the actual needs of the spiritual life of the social masses, simply prohibiting contact with certain paintings or songbooks and not having corresponding things to replace them will result in all prohibitions and inspections becoming empty talk. The constant full houses of various sequential operas and the fact that comic strips do not diminish in popularity due to a single order prohibiting them are clear evidence.</p>

<p>When the preparatory bell rang, there were only a few students in the classroom. There were quite a few hovering at the classroom door, and I don't know what they were busy with.</p>
<p>"He didn't come!" Old Chen said, standing at the classroom door with a book in his hand.</p>
<p>"He didn't come? Even better."</p>
<p>"No, I just saw him come."</p>
<p>"Anyway, that Mr. Liu rarely calls the roll."</p>
<p>"Isn't it the same as running after being called?"</p>
<p>"Then, hey! Old Zhang, mark me present."</p>
<p>"Mark me present, Old Li..."</p>
<p>A bunch of students, moving their hands and feet, playing and laughing, seemed to have discussed the result. A few people walked into the classroom and chose seats near the door. The rest winked at each other for a while, danced their feet, played a symphony, and left the classroom.</p>
<p>"Ding, ding, ding..."</p>
<p>There were still not many students in the classroom. Mr. Liu, wearing glasses with a thousand degrees of nearsightedness, walked onto the podium with a doctoral bag, looked at the students as usual, and took out the roll call list.</p>
<p>"Mr. Liu, don't call the roll, it saves time."</p>
<p>"No, there are very few people today."</p>
<p>"Mr. Liu, there are not many people anyway!"</p>
<p>"Wang XX..." Today he ignored the students' mischief</p>

<p>Fang Ruo, styled Yaoyu, is a native of Dinghai, Zhejiang, and is skilled in appreciation and collection.</p>
<p>Alright!</p>
<p>"Here!"</p>
<p>"Zhang XX..."</p>
<p>"His nose almost rubbed on the roll, and his right-hand pencil added a vertical line next to each person's name. As a result, most of them were present.</p>
<p>"Mr. Liu, why didn't you call my name?" A student suddenly shouted.</p>
<p>"What's your name?"</p>
<p>"..." He didn't say anything, but walked onto the podium and searched for his name on the roll with Mr. Liu. At this opportunity, in an instant, "giggle giggle" several students sneaked away. "Oh, got it," he found it, "Present, Mr. Liu, allow me to go out to pee, giggle giggle" Another one left. Mr. Liu only turned his head and glanced at him.</p>
<p>There were only a few people left in the classroom; the two girls in front were arguing over a photo of a male classmate. There was also a girl on the left, shy and angry, blushing and rolling her eyes at them. Seven or eight male students in the back were reading newspapers, reading novels, and one was writing a love letter. Some were dozing off. In short, no one was listening to what Mr. Liu was burying his head and talking about.</p>
<p>"Sasha, Sasha!" The minute hand on the watch turned past zero and pointed to the word "six".</p>
<p>"Mr. Liu, let's end the class, there are too few people."</p>
<p>"..." He just ignored it and continued to talk with his head shaking seriously.</p>
<p>"Chichi chi!" The soles of the leather shoes rubbed against the terrazzo floor for a while and finally succeeded, leaving class early.</p>

<p>— Guang Han</p>
<p>Almighty God is only almighty, and is ultimately not perfect enough to be called "perfect." Having created humans, He deliberately arranged for you to have organs and the like, so mortals always have to eat. Because food cannot be completely transformed into blood, eating inevitably leads to pooping. How troublesome! Human life begins with eating and pooping, and ends in a grand finale of eating and pooping!</p>
<p>Humans, to put it grandly, are the masters of the world, conquering everything, dominating everything, and creating everything. To put it modestly, they are just a digestive system that can only manage the function of eating and pooping. The life force is very weak. An earthworm is cut in two, and soon it will turn into two worms, wriggling. Humans, on the other hand, are sometimes hit by half a brick falling from the eaves and immediately "return to the underworld"!</p>
<p>Physiologists tell us that eating and pooping are human instincts, innate, and you can do it as soon as you leave your mother's womb. This gives us a lot of convenience, no need to learn again. It is hateful that God only endows people with the skills of eating and pooping. As for the effort of "getting from poop to mouth," they still have to spend some effort to practice on their own. People are the same, and although there is not much difference in the ability to eat and poop, there are great differences in the means of obtaining food. Some can almost "gain without labor," some must "gain after labor," and some "labor but still find it difficult to gain." Gaining without labor is obviously "getting what one should not get." Gaining after labor is considered "gaining the right way." As for laboring but still finding it difficult to gain, this is undoubtedly "being exploited." Therefore, the world is not fair!</p>
<p>If society had "equal food for everyone" or "less people and more food," that would be great, but things are just the opposite, "more people and less food," that's terrible! Because there are more people and less food, and there is not enough to distribute, there will inevitably be a dispute. The outcome of the dispute is to determine the winner. The winner will naturally have something to eat, and the loser should starve! Who told you not to work hard?

<p>— Zhang Lao San</p>
<p>(1) The Stream Under the Bridge</p>
<p>The sound of cuckoos arrived in the spring breeze. I held my younger brother's hand, treading the small path we walked every day, heading towards our parents' graves. The farmers working in the fields always smiled at us, or asked with a rough phrase, "Have you eaten breakfast yet?" After walking along the fields, there was a small bridge. The stream carried fallen flowers under the bridge: flowing from this side to that side, like this every day, like this every year. My younger brother, with light steps, jumped onto the bridge, picked up small pebbles, and threw them into the river. Ripples waved on the water's surface, disappearing slowly with the fallen flowers. To the left of the small bridge was our family's grave. Because it had been in disrepair for years, it was already dilapidated beyond recognition. Looking from the bridge, only a few earthen mounds were visible.</p>
<p>Just as we stepped off the small bridge, it seemed like a shadow flashed past the collapsed gate. In our village, there were often petty thieves stealing pine and cypress trees from people's graves, referring to the magnificent new structures: dark tomb walls, small three- or five-room tile-roofed houses, towering pine and cypress trees, and fresh, new soil. Would petty thieves even notice our grave with only four or five bare, dead pines? I asked my younger brother, and he also saw it, and it seemed like the back view of a woman. We looked around in all directions. Except for the earthen mounds, only a homeless puppy was lying on its back on the grass, waving its limbs at the sun.</p>
<p>In front of the grave, we lay down on the grass, watching the fleeting white clouds. My brother and I did not say a word. Around lunchtime, we retraced our familiar path home, like this every day, like this every year. Although today we lay down on the grass in the same way, there was clearly a different kind of emotion spreading in the silent nature. White clouds flew by, and the sound of cuckoos arrived in the spring breeze. I looked at my younger brother's innocent apple face, looked at the green grass on the two earthen mounds, and clear tears had already moistened my eyelashes. I seemed to apologize for the plan I had made last night, shaking my head. My younger brother also knew that something special was about to happen. He no longer had the lively attitude of jumping onto the small bridge, but neither of us wanted to break the serious atmosphere first. The sun's shadow slowly reached the center. We exchanged knowing glances, stood up, walked across the small bridge, and went home. The stream under the bridge continued to flow endlessly, carrying fallen flowers.</p>
<p>(2) A New Beginning</p>
<p>Stepping out of the school gate, when I breathed in a different kind of air, I once shouted "A New Beginning!" Who would have thought that "A New Beginning" would develop like this! Eating the food I didn't want to eat for more than a year: living the life I didn't want to live for more than a year. Now I am a lonely person in the desert. Where is my way out? Where is what I didn't consider, and couldn't consider? I will do my best, run my course, and find the light I need.</p>
<p>After a day of exhaustion, I still didn't feel sleepy at this time, probably because I was too excited. The passengers on the train were all smiling and having sweet dreams. I envied them. Although everyone didn't know each other's business, when my aunt left, I even promised to go to her house tomorrow. Now I was on a journey hundreds of miles away from my hometown.</p>
<p>When my younger brother woke up and saw the note, I don't know how sad he would be. Returning from the grave, I slightly revealed my intention. My clever younger brother certainly knew that I had a premonition of leaving, but tonight I would leave without saying goodbye. I remembered when my father was dying, he held my hand and told me that I could never leave my younger brother. Father initially loved my stepmother, and my brother and I had long forgotten that we were the sons of his first wife. In his sickly and desolate years, he repented to the portrait of my mother. Father was still our father. Now I have betrayed his dying words. I am an unfilial son to my father and an unrighteous brother to my younger brother. Complex thoughts and the rumbling of the rails played together. I finally cried. I left my parents' grave, left my younger brother whom I could never leave, and I was fighting for a vague future, but the whistle was roaring. It was trying its best to attack the darkness. The curtain of night will unfold a beautiful future before we reach our destination; I will hold my younger brother's hand and atone for my sins before your graves. I occasionally looked up, and the east faintly revealed a milky white color. The beautiful future is right in front of me. I will say again, this is my "New Beginning."</p>

<p>— Fu</p>
<p>She said that the main reason for divorce lies with women. Of course, this is what men dare not say.</p>
<p>This is what Helen Twelvetrees said. I dare not be so presumptuous, because I am a man. (Some say that if you are so timid, you are not a man, but many men dare not say it, so are they all not men?) Helen said: "Now that divorce is so prevalent in Hollywood, women are the biggest cause of this fashionable divorce disease. What is the reason? It's because when women marry men, they are too casual and don't take it seriously." Helen's words probably come from her own experience, because she has been married and divorced; but now that she has married Frank Wood, she has understood the necessities of a happy family. She said: "If a woman is not prepared to fulfill her responsibilities as a wife, and marries someone rashly, then she is asking for trouble and will have no joy." The following is a discussion published by Helen Twelvetrees:</p>
<p>"The country should issue laws ordering girls' schools to specify home economics as a required subject, so that every girl must learn the principles of being a wife, just as they learn spelling, reading, and arithmetic. When a woman grows up and makes a marriage commitment, she should do so with the same sincerity as choosing a career and signing a contract, or even more sincerity. She should be able to solve various family problems herself, just as she handles various business problems. The reason why marriage has been reduced to child's play now is because most women are not prepared when they step into the church, just as they prepare to do clerical and other duties."</p>
<p>"If I blame women like this, I may be scolded as a traitor to women, but my words are correct. Modern women now walk into marriage with their eyes closed and without thinking. They don't take their marriage vows seriously when they recite them, or they even have a thought in their minds: "If the marriage is not good, I can just get a divorce." The bride of today cannot be called a bride at all, she is just tasting the flavor. Recently, I had a friend. She has been married for less than two years, and recently she wanted to divorce her husband. She said, "I never believed that we could live together for long." She also wanted to sue for alimony. I asked her what the reason for the lawsuit was. She said, "I wasted two years of my time. In these two years, I could have married many people, or I could have made a fortune. So why shouldn't my husband pay a price?" I wouldn't talk to this kind of woman anymore, because she didn't believe that she could live together for a long time, but she married a man and wanted to make some money from him by divorcing him. There is no point in talking about marriage at all. The woman I'm talking about has not yet formally filed for divorce in court, but a friend told me that she is about to file for divorce, and it can be said that there is no reason at all. If she meets a reasonable judge, he will definitely not award her a penny of alimony." (To be continued)</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3 id="e282">Review of "Golden Harvest" <a href="#e282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Produced by Paramount. Premiered at the Grand Theater</p>
<p>Under the banner of the Blue Eagle, the American authorities are frantically implementing the so-called recovery movement. We can learn from newspapers that President Roosevelt's instructions attempt to mobilize the whole country for this movement, so it is inevitable that the film department will follow suit and reflect this.</p>
<p>To put it very clearly, this is a film with the theme of rural revitalization. Moreover, it strongly raises a serious social problem on the screen. Speaking of this, we cannot help but be surprised. In American films, we very commonly see the kind of intoxicated "Love you" films, but now we see that they are gradually paying attention to society as well. Moreover, they are using major social issues as the subject matter of the films, which is naturally a progressive phenomenon. Of course, we have also seen some films that reflect political forms, such as "Booze and Women," etc. However, the attitude of touting the current policies is also very obvious. If we were to give an example, then "The White House" would be the best proof.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Paramount is the film company that is most diligently loyal to Roosevelt. When the Guanglu Theater was still open, we watched many very diligent films, in addition to "Eagle Song" and "Roosevelt's Struggle History." Now there is this "Golden Harvest," which maintains a consistent attitude.</p>
<p>For the sake of reviewing the content, it is necessary to briefly narrate the story.</p>
<p>A farmer had two sons. The younger son farmed at home, and the older son did speculative business in Chicago. The older son used all means to manipulate the market, and the price of wheat fell sharply as a result, which resulted in the bankruptcy of the rural area. Therefore, the farmers were in distress and went on strike, and the younger son was the leader of the farmers' organization. Later, the older son, due to the interests of his brothers, intended to restore the price of the wheat market. In the end, the older son went bankrupt due to the opening of wheat and returned to the countryside.</p>
<p>As stated in the story, the author certainly stated that the reason for the bankruptcy of the rural area was due to the low market price of wheat, and the reason for the low market price was the manipulation of speculators. Of course, we do not deny that what is pointed out here is quite correct. In the American countryside with rationalized production, the "cheap grain hurts farmers" was not an indirect cause of the collapse. But why did the price of wheat fall? Naturally, the manipulation of the market by speculators is one of the reasons, but from the overall perspective, we cannot ignore the global economic panic. Due to the contradictions of the economic organization, on the one hand, there is overproduction, and on the other hand, purchasing power is reduced. The current world situation is urgent, expanding armaments and preparing for the redivision of the colonial market. Isn't this sharp expression enough to explain the true cause of rural bankruptcy? Of course, this point cannot be explained clearly in a few words, and economists can write a long article on it.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the author of "Golden Harvest" only explaining the manipulation of the exchange is not enough. At the same time, rural revitalization is not so simple either. Even if speculators do not monopolize the market, they cannot raise the price of the entire wheat, which is just a hopeless fantasy, let alone that speculators will not leave their own interests and discover their conscience to revitalize the rural area, no matter how earnestly the author says that businessmen and farmers should be like brothers. As for the author teaching the merchants from the countryside to return to the countryside in a preaching tone, it is even more laughable. It is simply impossible to justify itself.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, American authors are cautiously paying attention to social issues. Regardless of whether they can find a fundamental solution to these problems, it is very gratifying to bring the film into contact with real social phenomena. Because the author handles this kind of subject matter very cautiously, I have also written more about the content. Now let's turn to the performance. Then the author Ralph Murrhy's very solemn attitude is the characteristic of this work. He takes the rural problem as the focus of the work. For the style of general American films, he also writes some unimportant love, which is quite effective in improving the audience's interest. In addition, let's find a few more points to explain the director's cleverness.</p>
<p>1. In order to maintain social order, the scenes of farmers' strikes or riots are not directly depicted, but only indirectly brought through newspaper or telegraph reports.</p>
<p>2. At the beginning, the sketches of the countryside are handled very well with the Disosve method. In particular, the farming scene explains the rationalization of rural production, which is completely different from the Chinese countryside.</p>
<p>3. When the elder son flew to the countryside, many cattle and horses were frightened and ran away, and the old farmer's surprised face was added.</p>
<p>4. The reunion sound when the cups and plates are in a mess, utilizing the characteristics of sound films.</p>
<p>5. The two climaxes in the exchange are both handled properly. 6. When the old farmer got married, the pastor asked the bride and groom to kiss. In our imagination, it must be very embarrassing, but the director made her very brave, beyond people's expectations, and made people laugh.</p>
<p>7. The wrestling scene is very beautiful, and it also says that the two brothers are evenly matched.</p>
<p>The above are the highlights of this film. Generally speaking, the director is full of creativity. As for the actors, there is not much effort needed. Li Que Aaron seems to be more suitable than in previous works. It is better to have him play a strong role after all. Chester Morris, who plays the eldest son, played very well in a few scenes, such as spreading rumors that it was raining and running to the exchange in a raincoat, and when he went bankrupt. The old farmer couple were best when they eavesdropped on others talking at the door. In addition, the two daughters-in-law did not see anything special because the roles were not important.</p>
<h3 id="e283">"Lucky Land" to be Released Soon <a href="#e283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>Chen Yumei chose "Tian Er Lucky Land," which is the news published in various newspapers before. However, is this "Lucky Land" a "Lion Land" or a "Tiger Land"? Of course, you have to see it to know, and even the feng shui master has to see it before he can determine whether it is auspicious or inauspicious! It is said that this "Lucky Land" of Tianyi can be exhibited at the Carlton Theater in early next month for people to visit.</p>

<p>— A Yun</p>
<p>"Greasy Fragrance" is a work of neo-sensualism</p>
<p>Ziegfeld was the "Columbus" who discovered the beauty of the female type. He had sharp eyes and peered into the depths of women's hearts. He made great contributions in the history of film, especially after sound was brought to the screen, which further developed his talent and made many singing and dancing women into stars. When the news of his death was announced, everyone thought that the soul of the Ziegfeld class had fallen, and Ziegfeld's reputation had diminished, but the emerging master Deschall Dai stepped on the path he had not finished and continued his extraordinary efforts; holding up his red-hot torch and being a leader of progress.</p>
<p>He is an artist with a deep understanding of singing and dancing. He has composed music and written many books. His most famous script and song is "A Butterfly Intoxicated by Flowers," which is also his masterpiece of ascending to the peak of art.</p>
<p>Now, he has joined Fox Film Company and is taking on the arduous task of producing. His first blockbuster is "Greasy Fragrance" (according to the film novel "Woman's Weakness" published in this newspaper every day), which is also the masterpiece of Liliang Hawet's first leading role in Hollywood. In order to add to the beauty and atmosphere of the songs, he specially invited his old partners Robin and Fading to help. The two of them are artists who specialize in composing music for Shifrai. As for the director, he immediately took a fancy to David (David's works include the past "Great Gathering of Flowers" and the recent "A Butterfly Intoxicated by Flowers"), and there is also a male lead, Lewis, a warrior from "All Quiet on the Western Front."</p>
<p>He gave a speech saying: In the past, the group of dancers in singing and dancing films were just doing some enthusiastic work. Now that singing and dancing films have re-emerged, the scene is completely different. Every dancer must have a healthy physique, personality, and rich talent. It is not just singing and dancing. Every dancer must have ample opportunities to act and give full play to their instincts. There are countless unknown stars in Jielaiwu who have not been discovered. This new type of singing and dancing film will give every unknown hero (female) a chance to become famous.</p>

<p>— Donglin</p>
<p>Since Hitler came to power, he has used all means for various domestic and foreign events, and films cannot escape his iron fist. For the sake of reviving German national essence films, Hitler, in addition to setting up a so-called film bank, the first order was to prohibit Jews from setting up photography studios. As a result of this order, film companies established with Jewish capital have closed down one after another. The second order was to summon German film stars abroad to return home: those who violated the order and did not return home would have their German nationality revoked. At present, the German stars in the UK are all preparing to return to Germany. When this news spread to the United States, it caused great panic among the German stars in Hollywood. The famous German star Marie Dailey, and Dorothy Hawk, who gained fame for playing "The Girl in Uniform." I don't know if they will return home? If they don't return to Germany? Their nationality will be gone!</p>

<p>— Tian Fu</p>
<p>The economic aggression of imperialism caused the Great China Tobacco Company to suffer a terrible fate.</p>
<p>Business is getting lighter and lighter every day, like a remnant lamp that has run out of oil. There was no way to think about it, so the company authorities decided to make peace with foreign merchants. The terms of the peace treaty are one to five: foreign merchants contribute five boxes, and Great China contributes one box. Even if there is a market, it is not allowed to sell much.</p>
<p>The general manager of Great China signed the contract, his hands trembling. He spoke in a shivering voice: "It's still said...Chinese and foreign industries cooperate, this! ...This is...fair..." He hadn't said the word "fair" yet! He suddenly fainted. This is how the general manager became ill, and he went to the end of his life day by day. At one point, his eyes staring blankly at the important staff of the company surrounding the hospital bed, he gasped and said sadly: "I have worked hard all my life...to create this...Chinese-funded...Chinese-run factory, I never thought...today there would be...such a result..." In a faint sigh, the general manager fell silent.</p>
<p>A dark cloud flew across the sky, and the sun was blocked by the dark cloud.</p>
<p>What a depressing era!</p>
<p>(4) The Justice on the Fist</p>
<p>Foreign tobacco merchants' "fair terms" forced the general manager of Great China to death, and also shattered the rice bowls of countless male and female workers. The company is shrinking day by day, and the number of unemployed people is increasing. Wang Ada's woman has also suffered the fate of being laid off. One night. Ada and his woman and three brothers were sitting around the lamp; the daughter staggered in from outside, her face full of bruises, and cried on the table.</p>
<p>It was the daughter's beauty that caused the trouble again: Lao Hong, the warmonger in the factory, took a fancy to her. When she got off work, he tricked her into playing in the game field. People, bustling and noisy; the sound of gongs and drums was everywhere, all kinds of performances, all kinds of playthings. This country girl encountered something fresh! After coming out of the game field, the daughter was taken to a small inn. After eating, the female companion who came with her gently said to her: "It's late, let's live here!" She smiled and grabbed her hand: "Mr. Hong is very willing to be friends with you! He is a good person, you will definitely not suffer if you are on good terms with him. He has influence in the factory!"</p>
<p>The daughter panicked, her face flushed, her heart pounding: she fled back. She began to recognize the beastly nature beneath the smiling face: she cried.</p>
<p>Ada's brothers gritted their teeth angrily, shaking their fists: "That kid Hong, I'm going to beat that dog thing to death!" He wanted to reason with Hong, but they were caught by a large group of hooligans and "ate tea" in a small teahouse.</p>
<p>Everyone's face was pale, their hats were tilted, and their eyes flickered like inhuman beasts. Wang Ada and his brothers were surrounded in the middle. Wang Ada was so frightened that he kept clasping his hands. "It's all my brother's fault for being young and ignorant, and offending Mr. Hong! Please forgive me, please forgive me!" Thank you for your kindness, and nothing happened: Wang Ada hurriedly paid the tea money. (To be continued)</p>
