<p>時評</p>
<p>日煤與國煤</p>
<p>比年以來。外貨紛紛向中國市塲抛售。我實業部乃擬具傾銷稅徵收之法令。課傾銷商品以高率之關稅。俾期增大其成本。減少其傾銷之效力。而藉以維持我國内幼稚之産業。其用意非不善。政策亦非不適當也。特吾人以爲防止外貨之傾銷。一方面固當自徵稅着手。另一方面。尙須考察貨品傾銷發生之原因。然後對症下藥。杜絶其傾銷之可能性。方可實際有效。今請即就日煤與國煤一討論之。</p>
<p>考我國藏煤富量。據地質調查之調查。總量在二百二十三萬萬六千萬噸以上。唯目前産量甚少。每年約於二千五百萬噸之銷耗煤量中。除外人經營生産之一千四百萬噸外。本口産額。僅一千一百萬噸而已。而關係外煤之總額。合長江流域直接輸入之二百萬噸。共達一千六百萬噸。今日我國産業。雖未進入於發達之域。但若僅以本國産額。供消費之用。則終覺不足。此中國國煤産量之不足消費。即爲外煤日增之第一原因。九一八以後。日煤進口之激增。尤堪注意。蓋日煤之在中國市場上銷售者。可分爲二大類。一爲撫願順煤。二爲完全日本煤。往年上海每月所進日煤。大約在六萬噸左右。逮乎九一八後。日煤在華。一方面輸入量突增至十萬噸左右。一方面則貶落其市價。以求其出路。最近上海撫順一號屑煤。約售八兩左右。較之一年前已下落四五兩之譜。完全之日本煤。則價格較在其本國爲低廉。例如杵島煤在日本售每噸九兩五錢左右。在上海則僅售六兩八錢餘。再如大之浦煤。在日本國内售每噸七兩四錢餘。在上海則僅售五兩左右。此跌價傾銷即又爲外煤在華勢力擴張之一原因也。</p>
<p>夫日煤年來輸入之激增。如上所述。第一原因在國煤産量不足。此不足之現象。於近數年中。情形爲何如乎。長江流域湘鄂贛皖一帶煤鑛。至今多在匪區以内。産銷完全斷絶。至河北山東河南一帶鑛穴。雖産量較富。無如運輸不便。運價遇昻加之捐稅過重。成本無形增大。而産量亦漸次縮小。民國初元之際國有鐵道對於煤運。曾訂有特價之辦法。故北方各鑛。賴以發達。未幾煤運特價。相繼取消。而以煤斤一律列入六等。其後雖幾經低减。然視前已高出十之七八矣運價加大。實爲中國煤産日漸减少之一原因。亦即促進外煤日漸增多之一原因也。</p>
<p>今日日煤價格之急激貶落亦爲其付我抵制彼貨後之應有手段。蓋不如此。即不足以誘奸商之兜售。更不足以擴大其銷路。尤不足以與其他外煤相競爭惟彼所用之手段。我必更有以對付之。方能抵制其傾銷。今日而欲言抵制傾銷。其第一步固須微收日煤以傾銷之稅。加大其價格以縮小其行銷之可能性。但第二步我國即應於可能範圍内。减低煤斤運價。以利國煤運輸。次應减輕一切過重之捐稅。以减低國煤成本。再次從政治方面言。應即整理地方。化匪爲民。使中原數省。重歸安寗。則已停之鑛可復。未開之鑛可開。庶我國煤之産量。得以增加。</p>
<p>一旦國煤産量加豐。運輸方便。煤價减低。則外煤即無隙可乘。失其競爭之力。面我國人之煤業根基。亦可賴以穩固。若不此之圖。而僅僅以增加傾銷稅爲惟一手段。恐終不足以抵制外煤也。</p>

<p>分局計劃核准關於交通電話局、籌劃浦東市中心區分局計劃、業經交部核准、越界地段電話之請求拆裝者、亦已工竣、日來之要求拆除改裝者、仍陸繹不飛經過、再行决定正式開航日期、</p>
<p>滬粤綫開航期</p>
<p>該公司滬粤航綫、早已試航成功、嗣以種種問題、尙未商妥、致延至迄今尙未開航、最近西南當局、正在提倡航空事業故、該線曾一度謡傳、將停辦說、旋經該公司聲明不確、兹悉阻碍該線開航之種種問題、業已完全解决、至正式開航期、日内即可定奪、本月中旬、當可實現、該線沿綫各站、如上海·温州·厦門·香港·廣州·等一切設備、業已佈置妥當、並聞日後正式開航時、將用塞柯斯大號機飛航、由滬至粤、當日即可到達、而所經各站、均係通商大埠、預料該線開航後、營業發達、意中事也、</p>
<p>渝蓉段將恢復</p>
<p>該公司漢渝綫渝蓉段、數月前本已開航、嗣以成都機場狹小、而不適用、兼之機塲離城、路程頗遠、接送郵件及乘客、均感不便、旋即停飛、當在城内勘定空地一方、另行開闢新機場、自興工以來、業已數月、刻下各項工程、已次第告竣、該公司機師安利生、曾於上週飛往視察、頗爲滿意、故渝蓉叚航線、本月内當可照當開航云、</p>
<p>絶、惟電話局之接　台、尙不敷支配、故</p>
<p>對於未拆之越界電話機、將次第拆除矣、昨據電話局總工程師郁秉堅對新聲社記者稱、本局籌設浦東分局、交換機業已運到、該機係八百門交換機、惟已陳舊、尙須大加修理、方可應用、至於浦東原有之三日門自動式機、因該地電話多係向租界通話、仍須由人轉接、故决拆除、裝用由部領來之交換機、將浦東之自動機、裝於市中心區、浦東分局拆裝工程、預計十一月初即可完工、至於龍華分局、本局擬改裝自動機、預算約需五萬元、待交部核准、即可動工、電話局因［○］接綫台通話綫太少、故决添辦五十對、連前共爲一百對、價約十萬元、待此工程完竣後、越界話機、方可完全拆除、</p>

<p>工廠檢查交涉中止</p>
<p>費信惇兪鴻鈞昨午晤商之結果</p>
<p>在此情形下越界築路亦不能談</p>
<p>公共租界内工廠檢查問題、經市政府秘書長與工部局總裁費信惇、迭次磋商後、稍具端倪　嗣以工部局董事會堅爭管轄權致交涉前途、又趨黯淡、昨日下午、費信惇又　市政府秘書長兪鴻鈞、再度談及公共租界内之工廠檢查問題、兪秘書長以工部局主張、關於界内之工廠檢查必須保有管轄之權、中國當局不願再繼續討論設立界内工廠檢查處之事、而在　情形之下、關於越　築路問題之商談、亦不克提起云、昨日下午工部局董事會開會時、　總裁費信惇、特提出報告、於是工廠檢查及越界築路兩問題之交涉、均中止進行、</p>
<p>中英通報發報機件運滬</p>
<p>已運往眞茹電台配裝</p>
<p>本年底即可正式通報</p>
<p>交通部國際電訊局、爲籌備中英通報、在眞茹國際無綫電台、建築新發報台房屋並向英國馬可尼公司訂購發音機二架、收音機四架應用、收音機四架、業已先後運滬、配裝完竣、前日並由英運到發音機一架、於昨日運往眞茹裝置、尙有一架、已在運輸中、不久即可抵埠、中英通報定於年底實現、兹將各情分誌如次、</p>
<p>新台全部完工</p>
<p>國際電訉局、以中英通報、原有電台不敷應用爰特在眞</p>
<p>茹國際無綫電台旁、建築新發報台一座、該項工程、係由新營記營造廠得標承造、自四月間開始興工後、全部工程、於七月内次第完成、該項新台房屋、係由專家依照各項機件之面積大小而設計打樣、故内部工程、頗爲堅固耐久、</p>
<p>發報機已運到</p>
<p>該局向英國馬司尼公司訂購之天綫鐵塔機件、大號收音機四架、暨二十啟羅華特發報機二架、附通話機一架等機件、業已陸續運滬、天綫鐵塔、計眞茹三座、瀏行五座、均先後裝置完竣、至收音機四架運滬後、卽運至瀏河裝設、現亦工竣、尙有收報機二架、其中一架於　週前運到、當卽存儲麥根路電台、昨日方運往眞茹裝設、尙有一架、已由英啟運、不久卽可抵滬配裝、</p>
<p>籌備裝設地纜</p>
<p>據該台負責人語新新社記者、眞茹電台、與本埠南京路沙遜大厦内無綫電台之間、沿途曾裝有通話天綫、深恐遇有暴風雨及其他意外事件之時、該項天綫將受影響、勢必中斷現爲縝密完備計、擬由眞茹至南京路沙遜大厦電台内、沿途埋設地纜該項工程、須費約百萬元、至應用地纜、係向英國訂購、業已運滬、登報招商投標承裝、不久當可從事裝設、眞茹至麥根路電台一段、係屬中國地界、故裝設　纜、可無阻碍、但由麥根路至南京路一段、係屬租界、因種種關係將向租界内租用原有地纜應用、此事當不成問題、</p>
<p>添設電機備用</p>
<p>該電台全部機件、均賴電力發動、該項電力、係由閘北水電廠供給、每月用電爲數頗鉅、該台現已向南京交部建設會、購定發電機一座、現正在眞茹添築房屋、以資設置擬於最短期内完成、日後電台一部份、需用電力、將由該電機供給、裝設該項電機之動機、一面固爲範省經費但其最大原因、係防水電公司萬一遇有意外或停止供給電力時之急需</p>
<p>中英年底通報</p>
<p>至中英通報日期　據該台向新新社記者宣稱、收音機四架已先後裝竣、但發音機二架、現已運到一架、尙有一架、不久當可抵滬、一切裝配工程、須時約一月餘、始克就緒至接綫試報等手續、頗爲繁冗、故中英通報期、最早須在年底、始克實現、</p>

<p>電力公司工人　昨日繼續怠工</p>
<p>形勢益趨險惡</p>
<p>大公社云、上海電力公司新老兩廠全體工人二千餘名、因反對廠方開除工人、及扣撥養老金、發生總怠工、昨仍繼續怠工、黨政機關派員調解、但亦無效、兹分誌各情如下、</p>
<p>拒絶領取工資自新老兩廠全體工人同時總怠工後、經工部局總辦鍾思向公司當局磋商、仍無結果、公司態度依然堅决、復於昨晨、在廠門口、發貼英文通告催領工資、但直至下午五時半、並無一人前往具領、兹　該通告云、凡新廠工人、已離職務者、可於十月三日（卽星期二）上午、在楊樹浦洞庭路新廠牌子間、領取工資、特此通告、副總裁兼總理薛爾德啟、一九三三年十月三日、</p>
<p>工方請願市府四區水電工會、自　　兩廠工人實行總怠工後、曾於前日携呈派員向市府請願、適因吳市長就警備司令兼職、該會乃復於昨晨九時、推派代表倪文富·朱浩生·陳友發·潘根林·陳妙生·胡有生·等六人、續往市府請願、要求予以援助、並迅飭廠方發給養老金、當由第一科科員張益譽接見、詢明過去辦法、及怠工情形後、允卽轉令社會局迅予調解、並勸令各工人靜候解决、忽再起糾紛、免致糾紛更形擴大、該代表認爲滿意始返、</p>
<p>黨政調解無效市黨部·計會局·據四區水電工會呈報後、曾於前日派員調查、復於昨晨十時、市當部派戴有恒·社會局派朱金濤再往江西路電力公司嘉字間、晤副總裁兼總理薛爾德、進行調處、結果廠方認爲此次工方、毫無理由、發生工潮、對於工方所提要求、表示難以接受、後祗討論養老金問題、但亦毫無結果而散、</p>
<p>工方顧全火政　上海電力公司、自新老兩廠工人實行總怠工後、三班工仍照常維持發電、尙未受到影響、但工潮一旦不解决、難免不波及三班工人、雖已僱有白俄五十餘人、但經騐不如華工、且不敷分配、平時該公司如發生火警、公司必有派出華工、前往剪電綫、現在該華工亦加入怠工、公司深恐火警發生、難以應付、故於昨日派員向工方接洽、要求該剪綫工人、先行復工、工方爲顧全地方安寗起見、亦已允許所請、</p>
<p>駁辯公司聲明　四區水電工會、昨駁辯公司聲明云、上海電力公司、自總裁霍潑根斯就任後、卽陸續開除工人、先後達六百餘人之多、全體在職工人羣情恐慌、乃組織工會、謀一致團結、以圖抗爭、詎公司仍不稍顧忌、摧殘壓迫、又見加厲、並吞没二人養老金、糾紛業集、迄未解决、中間曾經工人直接向公司當局、一再請求無效、復經黨務機關、數度派員調處公司亦未予接受、又經華董袁履登虞洽卿徐新六及市商會主席王曉籟諸先生、謁誠調停、亦無結果、此次在懸案未决之際、新廠又藉故開除三工人、經六頭目向廠畏愛爾門磋商、竟遭拒絶、工人忍無可忍、故不得已宣告怠工、公司所謂事前未接工方任何請求者、完全爲掩飾之詞、特爲駁斥如上、幸希各界公鑒、</p>

<p>海關聽差節規</p>
<p>即從今天中秋實行年可節省數萬餘元　　滬上各業帮之進出口報關行大小有二百數十家平日對於江海關之聽差每逢三節例送節規其間雖大小不等然爲數亦甚巨大自數十元起至四五百元止平均每家以二百元計年需數萬金之鉅歷來如是牢不可破幾成爲一種定例自上次聽差舞弊案發生後本埠報關業始公議廢除節規之惡例經一致公决兹將此事情形分述如下</p>

<h3>曾照將軍府裏人</h3>
<p>— 烟橋</p>
<p>套調改唐詩雖酸氣却别有風味［只今惟有遼陽月·曾照將軍府裡人。］在今夕在邦具古城的少帥，倘然有一點詩興，應該有這麽一個感想。</p>
<p>關外在中秋，是不是也有齋月宫，走月亮的規矩？我可不知道。但關内本來有這個規矩的·今年大槪也没有興會了。農村空虛貧乏得連香斗都買不起。小資産階級，忍了痛去買些瓜果香花來應景兒，可是只能愁眉苦臉的對着月兒發怔只有少數的富貴人家·還在那裡及時行樂我看到　州幾家茶食店裡·月餅的滅少·和香店裹香斗的不背踵事增華，竊極富麗，就可以推想如上述。</p>
<p>本來中秋的月·用不着去齋。照宋岳珂的愧郯說，中秋玩月，還是從唐朝開元以後起始的。以前像梁元帝江上望月，朱超舟中望月，唐太宗遼城望月都不是中秋大槪爲了事文類聚說唐明皇於中秋夜和鴻都道士遊月宫聽霓裳羽衣曲因此老百姓也想望屠門而大嚼在中秋孝敬些東西希望有月華看見希望摇紗的小姑娘得到一個金椗子赤金每兩一百十四元怎麽不做黄金夢呢？</p>
<p>科學家說月球是已經失夫生命的東西現在不過借着日光在天上挨一個恒星的分兒。那麽伊也是狠可憐的我們齋伊意思是淐弔伊，安慰·，我們要是再說什麽［月到中秋分外明，］便是取笑伊了。</p>
<p>將軍府在那裡？將軍府裡人在那裡？可曾瞧見那個遼陽月，恐怕有的在賞秦淮月，有的在賞西江月有的·········，只有走不開去的幾千萬老百姓，正好看那不願意看的遼陽月。</p>
<h3>獨賞中秋月</h3>
<p>— 顔波光</p>
<p>萬里清輝的團　明月，最易惹起游子思鄉的念頭尤其是中秋日的晚上因爲月到中秋分外明想起故鄉就連想起東北的淪亡人民的痛苦丨嘴裏雖吃着中秋月餅那裏再吃得下肚呢？</p>
<p>人生的飄流是狠感痛苦的在來富所唱的一首俚歌裏面已曲曲表現丨來一月子彎彎照九洲幾家歡喜幾家愁幾個夫婦同羅帳幾個飄零在外頭丨］很覺苦樂不匀尙有許多同胞因貧富階級懸殊的關係一方面在大吃火腿月餅咧蓮蓉月餅咧百菓月餅咧，······貧苦的連樹皮草根都没有吃丨揚州李文俊在打掃白花臺的時候就隨手題着這麽一副聯··［人人是人世間祇重富貴人。·］［月月有月，人人獨賞中秋月。］很幽默的諷剌着一般趨炎附勢的，其實平均果然是談不到，不過一個人不應該只重富貴人和獨賞中秋月總要替大衆想想否則我們只顧吃月餅東北的民衆只好永遠處在水深火熱之中了試問獨賞中秋月的朋友對此作何感想？</p>
<h3>美麗的月姊</h3>
<p>— 持佛</p>
<p>春之花秋之月是慰藉人生最好的東西在這天高氣爽丹桂飄香的時候月兒尤覺可愛古人說··一月到中秋分外明。一我們對此秋夜的月，自然要發生許多感想了　　月是女性所以温柔　媚李商隱稱伊［月姊，］丨月姊曾逢下彩蟾［月娥］，丨月娥未必嬋娟子丨這是何等香艶。甚麽［姮娥］［嫦娥］從來都把月兒女性看的我想女人多麽妝飾終不及［月玲瓏皓月皎潔太空畢竟是一位莊嚴美麗的月姊姊］的天然　媚荆釵布裙澹掃娥眉旣不摩登也不浪漫萬古澹艶千載清輝人間婦女那裏及得伊來從前杜工部生當亂世見月傷感道··［今夜鄜州月閨中只獨看！］現在我們覊身麝囂萬斛的都市舉頭望月能不有老杜之感嗎？</p>
<p>月似美人故有明月前身之語有題山陰任伯年繪嫦娥圖道··［維彼嫦娥太陰之眞瑶池竊藥蟾窟歸眞清輝終古照徹八垠··盈盈三五刦歷千春廣寒高處執與爲鄰青天碧海莫問前身近人香奩特道［郎似月圓儂鏡圓鏡圓常定在郎前月圓到處儂難管知送清光阿那邊一進是女兒把月喻郎嬌憨怨妒隱約字裏行間　　美麗的月姊伊的體重實可驚人天文學家說月球重約七十五京噸便是七五下加三十個圈約爲地球重量八十八之一伊裏面還有火山造蹟大的地方其直徑口有三百餘里四面高山很像城堡一般明皇所遊的廣寒清虛之府詩人所說的貝闕蟾宫雖道使是這裹嗎？但我們從地上瞧來玲瓏皓月皎潔太空畢竟是一位莊嚴美麗的月姊</p>
<h3>關於月餅的話</h3>
<p>— 緒劍屏</p>
<p>最最有名的月餅當然要首推蘇式和廣式兩種了·，這兩種之中尤以蘇式的清水玫瑰和廣式的連蓉最爲可口。</p>
<p>如果用淡緑豆湯（去渣）和蓮蓉月餅同吃則非特清香而且爽口清水玫瑰月餅大家都嫌其太甜但是倘使和極絡湯同吃就不會覺着甜得膩人了講究吃月餅的同志丨不妨試試</p>
<p>前天我買了一個頂大的廣東月餅用小洋刀在上面劃成了中國的簡圖先將東三省和熱河的一部分切下來給兩個幼弟分食起初他們達莫明其妙所以到手就吃等到吃完之後我就指着那切剩的月餅問他們·，［可再要吃嗎？］他們都對了這月餅呆看了一會，才鳴咽着說··一不吃了！永遠不吃了！］我覺得此法很有感化力。所以希望全國的小學敎師和家長，都照樣的借此來灌輸一下幼童的愛國觀念。</p>
<h3>一件小事</h3>
<p>— 錢醉竹</p>
<p>無論什麽事放在嘴上說不如擺在手上做與其勸别人不如求自已</p>
<p>我爲什麽平空說這兩句空話呢？這是日本人敎我學的乖</p>
<p>我從前年［九一八］以後直接間接受到牠的影響眞不是意思擬議所能想像的環境的逼迫精神的苦悶祇少快刀抺脖子旣而在再三躊躇之後便立定了一種主張便是··</p>
<p>［咬菜根吃苦竪春梁作事］</p>
<p>來應付我的環境又把</p>
<p>來作我消極的報國辦法兩年來困苦的環境雖没有打開却也没有困住惟有那［不用一切外貨］的主張却很不容易稍一不小心便買了外貨回來璧如煤油是家家必用的東西没國貨替代没奈何我寗可費事一些用炭風爐把火油爐子擱起來</p>
<p>有一次電線出毛病中國電料没處置（彼時中國電泡廠右者尙少或竟無有）没奈何跑到舊貨舖裏出重價去讓了一些來對付着眞要不爲營業關係我寗可倒退三十年用蠟燭</p>
<p>兩年裏頭類如這樣的事不知發生了多少困難我多抱定了［有國貨用國貨没國貨寗可不用］的主意貫澈了主張雖然幾次受到家人朋友們的作難但不久也都被我同化了</p>
<p>最近又因爲濕氣大發兩足潰爛受了一次試騐看病吃藥當然是没有一國界的西醫西藥治濕氣包得定手到病除可是我信中國就没有洽爛脚的藥那知走遍藥舖現成的爛脚藥竟其没有一誤十日爛得寸步難移便有人勸我買［一九一四］的買［阿墨林］的也有呌我請西醫看的我笑道我爲了［九一九］·所以不用［九一四］我爲了不做外國人的［阿木林］所以不用［阿墨林］我爲了有中醫所以不請敎西醫</p>

<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第十六回　酸楚襟懷當前還祝福倥偬戎馬暗裏突移軍</p>
<p>趙自强今天請了一整天的假軍營裏一切的事情都已置之腦後只在家裏陪着賓客打牌有時借着週旋楊家來賓的機會還要到前面院子裏去稍坐一會和桂枝談上一兩句話所以他雖然是感到二十四分的忙碌在這裏面依然不曾減少他的樂趣這一天他忙過去了到了次日清晨六時他就起床了因爲軍營裏的軍紀規定了是要六時以前回營的所以他也就不能不在六時以前起床他忽忽忙忙的了大門就向西苑大營走來這個時候鄉下還没有人力車子出來營業他一個人走到曠野裏來並不見什麽人行走東方樹杪上發現了一大片金黄色的雲彩將那金黄色的光平射到麥地裏來那一尺長的麥苗田野裏是互相接連着猶如在大地上蓋了一床得厚的緑毯人在這麥田裏走着那没有陽光的空間空氣流動着似乎帶了一種微微的消香送到人的鼻子裏來人呼吸了這種空氣精神上自然是感到了一種愉快然而就是走起路來也覺得有勁趙自强在這個時候一切都感着有興味，心想以後結了婚來往這西苑海甸的大道上恐惶是更要頻煩好在重營去家是這樣的近便是一天走上一次那也没有什麽關係好在自已是個軍人每日走幾里路這很不算一回事而且以後由營裏回家去的時候恐惶還得快快的走因爲我們那位可心太太那必是要在大門口站着望我回去的呢他如此想着不由得一個人笑起來了。（一○五）</p>

<h3>虞山栗</h3>
<p>— 俞友清</p>
<p>作客吳下已有三秋了昨天故鄉的友人來送了我一包新鮮栗子這是我故鄉的特産經像千里以外摹地遇見了舊雨一般的快樂因爲我已多年没有吃到故鄉的栗子了</p>
<p>故鄉預山地方的鮮毛栗子名麝香囊這個名字多麽香艶令人見了這名字就想到那甜而嫰的麝香囊的滋味眞可以掉一句文言呌做［不同凡品］哩</p>
<p>在旱北門一帶興福附近地方的桂花栗子剥出來吃有些桂花香味就是把　煮熱了也不變其味的比了麝香囊的滋味名有佳處。</p>
<p>秋凉天氣興福的王四酒家應時開張了除了油雞以外鮮栗炒雞最爲佳品實在合子一句俗語［打耳光不肯放手］的話</p>
<p>鮮栗子湯一名栗羹確是醒酒的珍物向栗樹上取了鮮栗子下來剥去了外彀就拿鮮栗放在熱水中用文火煮起來一匙甜湯和鮮栗向口中送去一定感覺得異樣的有味</p>
<p>栗子因人也名的要算酒釀二二了他的栗子不以大爲貴完全是小而圓先將栗子放在水中浸了一下拿出來風乾然後用小針將栗子剌了小孔放在沙中炒炒到半熟的時候將糖漿放在沙中等到栗子熟了了糖漿不在沙中都在　内了所以他的栗子比别人來得貴也比别人來得好吃因他兼微酒釀就呌他酒釀二二</p>
<p>若然他不相信我的故鄉的栗子好名那末我來介紹一段東西給你們看就可知道我言的不虛這一段東西是讀盡樓主虞山啖栗記中的一段刋在民國十八年瘦鵑編的自由談中··</p>
<p>丨繼出鮮栗羹一簋實擬黄金漿誇白玉更和以錫糖甘嫩芬芳别饒野味　君謂北山所産之栗較勝於西山剌短實小者則尤鮮嫰作羹之栗必須摘於樹頭者若隔宿或入城市所售者則美味全失矣</p>
<p>從這一段東西裏間可以知道我的故鄉栗子的著名了但是作客他鄉的我秋風一起就想到故鄉的鮮栗好像張志和之於蓴羹鱸膾一般尤其讀到讀畫樓主虞山啖栗記中的這段東西更加便得我動了思鄉之念故鄉可愛的東西多啦尤其興福一帶的新鮮栗子更使我有如千里懷人似的億念着。</p>

<p>實力平平毫無精彩</p>
<p>優游足球隊昨邀英軍阿伽爾作友誼賽於中華棒球塲因時間上之錯誤報載二時開始比賽阿隊誤爲四時觀來千餘人枯坐塲中延頸以待者有兩小時之久於是不耐紛求退票治觀衆一齊出塲之後阿隊始姗姗來但已過時矣</p>
<p>昨日出塲者係阿伽爾之飛機隊實力平庸聯絡亦差較諸優游相去極遠故作戰時毫無精彩之可言上半時李碩友先射一球胡有成在得球五分鐘之後得李碩友盤進之臂助一撥成功阿隊亦曾有數度進攻機會祇以江王二將牢牢把守無隙可乘終難如願下半時搏擊至二十分鐘雨方未開紀録奚巧生以迅雷不及掩耳之手段再增一球開排再戰轉瞬間又爲胡有成乘間摀破敵門成四與零之比至於優游陳容對於聯絡上尙須痛下工夫</p>

<h3>二十年度浙省敎育統計</h3>
<p>浙江省二十年度敎育統計所表示者雖多係數量關問題於質量之表示甚少但數量所告示吾人之事實至爲具體確切足爲各項興革之重要依據本省二十年度敎育統計業已由敎廳編竣爰將其中最顯著之事實摘述於後以爲研究本省敎育者之參考</p>
<p>初等敎育</p>
<p>（一）小學敎職員之資格與待遇二十年度統計結果全省小學敎職員之資格師範畢業者（高中師範科舊制師範各種短期師範及高等師範均包括在内）占全體百分之二一·六其他學校畢業者（小學·中等學校·專科以上學校均包括在内）佔百分之六二·一非學校畢業者占百分之一六·三又全省小學敎職員之待遇統計結果平均月薪爲一○·八四元（以上係就全省情形言若杭州市及少數優良縣份當然比全省平均數高出許多）</p>
<p>（二）小學校數及學生數之增加情形二十年度全省小學校數爲一一·七三六所小學學生數爲六八三六○一人與十九年度比較計增加學校四○所學生二三八七六人是項增加數目就全體觀之似不甚小然以七十六縣市平均計算則每一縣市一年内不過增加學校五·三所學生三一四人實不能算大</p>
<p>（三）全省失學學齡兒童數之估計本省最近學齡兒童確數無從知悉惟據本省人口第二次調查結果爲二一·二四九·八九八人平常以人口數十分之一推算學齡兒童則本省學齡兒童數當爲二·一二四·九九○人查二十年度本省統計全省已人學學齡兒童數爲六二二·四○八人（係就小學初級學生計算小學高級學生及私塾學生均未計人）由此推算則全省失學學齡兒童數當爲一五○二·五八二人約占全體百分之七○·七又二十年度統計結果每一小學生平均歲占經費數約爲七元以此數與失學兒童數相乘則爲一○·五一八·○七四元換言之就目前經濟狀况而論每年需經常費（開辦費不計在内）一○·五一八·○七四元可使本省學齡兒童全體入學</p>
<p>（四）各項平均數之多寡與學校内容之充實程度二十年度統計結果全省初等學校每校平均所有學生爲五八·二五人每校平均所有學級爲一八五級每敎職員平均所敎學生爲二四·四四人每學級平均所有學生爲三一·六八人</p>
<p>（五）私立小學在全省小學中之地位二十年度統計全省縣市立小學爲八三六校占全體百分之七一三區鄉鎭立小學爲五七一七校占全體百分之四八·七一私立小學爲五·一八三校占全體百分之四四·一六與江蘇省相比本省之公立小學不及江蘇省之多而私立小學則過之此種私立小學可爲推行義務敎育之輔助極爲重要其數目之多甚可樂觀</p>
<p>（六）各縣市初等敎育狀况之差異情形本省各縣市因面積人口財力等各不相同交通之便利與否亦互異故敎育之發達程度相差甚大此種差異試此較各縣市統計表上所表示之數目卽可知悉此處不及二述明惟有一重要現象可注意者卽各縣市初等敎育各項數量在平均數以下者比在平均數以上者爲多換言之各縣市數量之分配情形偏於較小的一端僅有少數之縣市敎育狀况比較甚爲發達而多數之縣份則均在不發達之列例如二十年度全省各縣市初等敎育經費共計四八一一六七二元（公私欵合計）平均每一縣市約爲六三三一二元但在六三三一二元以上者僅二十一縣一市而在六三三一二元以上者則有五十四縣</p>
<p>中等敎育</p>
<p>（一）全省中等學校立别之比較全省中等學校二十年度統計學校數省立共計二十校縣市聯立共計五十一校私立亦五十一校經費數省立共一○八四○九三元縣·市·聯立共三八四八七七元私立共七五七五九六元其經費數私立學校不及省立學校縣·市·聯立學校則更不及私立學校縣·市·聯立學校經費數旣少故其内容亦不能優良試觀二十一年度中學畢業會考結果省立學校比較均優私立校有劣者亦有優者而縣市聯立學校則大多數甚劣可知經費之多寡與内容之良否有重大之關係也</p>
<p>（二）全省中等學校各科學生數之比較二十年度全省中等學校各科學生數計初中一六·六二○人占全體百分之七五·六六高中普通科一·八五一人占全體百分之八·四三高中師範科及短期師範訓練科共一·八二三人占全體百分之八·三○高中及初中職業科共一·六七一人占全體百分之七·六一○就上列數目觀之初中學生所占百分比甚大職業及師範兩科則甚小再從歷年度統計觀之初中學生所佔百分比亦有逐漸增加之趨勢計十八年度占百分之七三·七十九年度占百分之七四·○五二十年度則占百分之七五·六六</p>
<p>（三）中等學校敎員之資格全省中等學校敎員（職員不在内）之資格就二十年度統計觀之大學畢業者占百分之三一·八一師範大學及高等師範畢業者占百分之一○·四四專門學校畢業者占百分之二五·○五留學外國者占百分之六·○六其他占百分之二六六四以上其他一項大約以在縣立及私立學校者爲多在省立學校者則甚少</p>
<p>（四）全省中等學校各項平均數二十年度統計結果全省中等學校每校平均所有學生爲一八○·○四人每校平均所有學級爲五·三九級每級平均所有學生爲三三·三八人每敎職員平均所有學生爲八·○八人以上各項平均數與前述初等學校狀况比較每校平均所有學生數及學級數中等學校均比比初等學校大每敎職員所有學生數則中等學校不及初等學校又中等學校每一學生平均歲占經費數統計結果爲一○一三七元比小學生約大一四·五倍（小學生平均歳占經費數約爲七元）</p>
<p>社會敎育</p>
<p>（一）民衆學校及民衆敎育館歷年增加情形本省民衆學校數十七年度三一一校十八年度一·○五九校十九年度一·四六○校一十年度一·七一二校由上述數目觀之自十八年度起本省民衆學校每年度均有增加十八年度之增加比較最爲顯著比十七年度計增加三倍以上本省民衆敎育館數十七年度爲二一所十八所度爲四八所十九年度爲八二所二十年度爲九五所以上所述數目每年度亦均有增加</p>
<p>（二）民衆學校生畢業與否之比例民衆學校學生常有半途辍輟學者故畢業學生數不多二十度統計結果全省民衆學校學生共計六二·歲一六九人其中畢業者二三·○七三人大約畢業人數與不畢業人數爲一與一·七之比</p>
<p>（三）全省民衆學校各項平均數二十年度全省民衆學校各項平均數計每學校平均學生三六·三人每學級平均學生二九·一人每敎職員平均學生一四·三人以上各項平均數目均不甚大其中敎職員一項因民衆學校敎職員多係兼任故每人平均所敎學生數欲其增加勢較困難</p>
<p>（四）全省失學成年人數之估計本省人口據第一次調查結杲爲二一·二四九·八九八人依照敎育部所定失學成年人估計方法（見十九年六年月敎育部敎育方製委員會所編改進全國敎案育方案）以全體人口數百分之四六·五推算則本省失學成年當爲九·八八一·二○二人又二十年度統計結果全省民衆學校每一學生平均編占經費數爲一·三元假定以此數爲標準則全省晋及成年補習敎育共需經費二一·八四五·五六三元（卽一·三元與失學成年人數相乘之積）</p>
<p>（五）各縣市社會敎育之差異情形依據二十年度統計各縣市民衆學校最多者九三所最少者一所各縣市民衆敎育館嚴多者六所最少者一所各縣市社會敎育經費（就縣市欵計算）最多者三○·六三五元最少者六六三元</p>

<h3>看變戲法</h3>
<p>— 游光</p>
<p>我愛看［變戲法］</p>
<p>他們是走江湖的所以各處的戲法都一樣爲了歛錢一定有兩種必要的東西一隻黑熊一個小孩子</p>
<p>黑熊餓得眞瘦幾乎連動彈的力氣也快没有了自然這是不能使牠强壯的因爲一强壯就不能駕馭現在是半死不活却還要用鐵圈穿了鼻子再用索子牽着做戲有時給喫一點東西是一小塊水泡的饅頭皮但還將勺子擎得高高的要牠站起來伸頭張嘴許多工夫纔得落肚而變戲法的則因此集了一些錢</p>
<p>這熊的來源中國没有人提到過據西洋人的調查說是從小時候由山裏捉來的··大的不能用，因爲一大，就總改不了野性然而雖是小的也還須［訓練］，這［訓練］的方法，是［打］和［餓］，而後來則是因虐待而死亡我怕這話是的確的，我們看牠還在活着做戲的時候就　得連熊氣息也没有了·有</p>
<p>些地方，竟稱之爲［狗熊］，其被蔑視至此</p>
<p>孩子在塲面上也要喫苦，或者大人踏在他肚子上或者將他的兩手扭過來他就顯出很苦楚，很爲難，很喫重的相貌要看客解救六個五個再四個，三個······而變戲法的就又集了一些錢。</p>
<p>他自然也曾經訓練過但這苦痛是裝出的和大人串通的勾當不過也無礙於賺錢</p>
<p>下午敲鑼開塲這樣的做到夜收塲看客走散有化了錢的有終於不化錢的</p>
<p>每當收塲我一面走一面想兩種生財傢伙一種是要被虐待至死的再尋幼小的來一種是大了之後另尋一個小孩子和一隻小熊仍舊來變照樣的戲怯</p>
<p>事情眞是簡單得很想一下就好像令人索然無味然而我還是常常看此外呌我看什麽呢諸君？</p>
<h3>從一部怪書說起</h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>文華美術圖書公司最近出版的文章構造法可說是空前絶後的一部怪書這部題［楊杏佛著］是假的題［楊人楩編］也是假的冒名影戲在上海灘上本不希奇最奇的這部書倒是一部眞書民國十二年梁任公在東南大學講演中學以上作文敎學法由衛士生東世澂二君筆記在中華書局出版筆記後面還附了梁任公在清華大學講演的中國韵文裹所表現的情感的未完稿文華的文章構造法便是中華的中學以上作文敎學法的原板翻印翻印了一位死人的著作呌另一位死人頂鈔襲之名眞是曠世奇聞楊杏佛受此不白之寃當在地下呼屈不止楊人楩也在晦氣之列（據說北平另有楊人楩見文華復信·）無端客串一塲雙包案</p>
<p>這種怪現狀的出現並不是偶然的</p>
<p>從根底上看這是中國文化界没落的投影近年出板界幾乎是死寂了呼吸太不自由誰也不敢刋印有價值的著作··因爲明是非談眞理就有不測的危險書賈們小心火燭只好從兒童青年身上想花樣··兒童讀物的競爭敎科用書的競爭即是出板界無路可走的表徵文章作法之類的著作妙在不惹是非文華所以要刋文章構造法動機想也無非如此等到文章作法之類也換盡花樣無可再變如文華之翻中等以上作文敎學法出板事業即已走到絶路靜候未日好了</p>
<p>就已出板的文章作法之類的著作而論未看作法文章如此··旣看作法文章還是如此文章作法之爲作法可知如梁任公的談中學以上作文敎學法要算其中最好的一種文華看中了這一種原板翻印（中華刋本中的中國韵文裹所表現的情緒並非完稿飲冰室文集中所刋方爲完稿）不爲無見至少比翻别一種作法較爲有意義青年在什麽考試什麽考試之後都想起文章是人生唯一的敲門磚文章構造法該銷路很好罷活人不能替活人寫一本值得一看的書還勞死人來擺塲面中國學術界之充實可知</p>
<p>嗚呼我不獨爲怪書而長嘆息也</p>
<h3>立立病了</h3>
<p>— 衛增本</p>
<p>立立病了</p>
<p>整天呀呀地哭像永遠忘記了笑似的</p>
<p>。</p>
<p>在牀哭着在母親懷裹哭着在喝藥水時哭着（在吃東西時却笑着，）···</p>
<p>病是輕微的可是依然呀呀地哭，涙球子從睫毛間滾在張大的嘴裏。</p>
<p>晚上立立正站在哭勁兒上面他母親驀地喊起來··</p>
<p>［桂媽丨］</p>
<p>（哭聲暫時地消失。）</p>
<p>［什麽事呵丨奶奶丨］</p>
<p>［别放化子進來呀不是立立在哭呢。］</p>
<p>［阿······去去這兒没有孩子的···奶奶化子去啦他說哭的孩子是要捉的啦</p>
<p>似乎爲了［化子去啦］的緣故立立又呀呀地哭着而且　響像要恢復恰才損失了的哭聲地</p>
<p>鄰近房裏有貓呌的聲音可不是一隻有着怕人的緑眼珠的野貓的呌丨</p>
<p>［貓，貓，］嚇了的立立把身子楱近母親</p>
<p>［唔乖孩子哭了可知貓就要來了哩］</p>
<p>輕拍着小肩膀母親在心裏笑着</p>
<p>突然野貓的呌聲轉了調子變成</p>

<h3>袁中郎做官（續）</h3>
<p>— 阿英</p>
<p>對於心身兩不相適的［官生活］害得中郎眞如被縛的山中猿猴鎖在籠中焦急欲死終至大病病到所謂［面如烟骨如系肘如戟］（與王聞溪）而不得不預備［墓文］眞是一趣事與曹以新王百榖書云··</p>
<p>連日頭眩目昏嘔血數斗恐遂不能起未免以墓文累大筆也奈何哉！奈何哉！不肖此時惟首邱是望報劉又屬第二着矣嗟夫聖明在上小臣雖不敢效彭澤之顰曳漆園之尾然亦安可以性命殉官爵耶</p>
<p>［以性命殉官爵］中郎是不願幹的他的乞去職書也就說過在與管東溟書裏也曾提到這一點所謂［宦心灰冷歸腸迫切不肖雖愚豈以七尺易一官］而且表示對這　卑劣的［官生活］的不滿說［奈何低眉事人苦牛馬之所雞貌妾婦之所羞乎］讀中郎尺牘至此回想他走馬上任的一書其得意的情形與此狼狽的狀態眞是可笑可憐　　其實中郎在做官時期的快樂是很短的上任不久他就有去志了他當時寫信說一俗史之縛人甚矣明年將掛冠此意已决］（與屠長卿）於此可以想見他到任之日即是决去之時到了明年他果眞的實踐自已的這一决定了他覺得很高興寫信給伯修狂歡的說［弟乞休已决數日内便可作無事人快哉快哉］那裏知道事實有不然者没有被允許於是他憤慨的寫信給羅郢南說··</p>
<p>說做官難不知求去更難自入秋來見烏紗如糞箕青袍類敗網角帶似老囚長枷進退狼狽實可哀憐這種說法可謂幽默刻毒之至然中郎的中心憤憊是不難想見的對於做官曾經是他懇的仙境的［官生活］他眞是恨得不得了因之待到辭官被許他快活得如上九天［看花西湖訪道天目往返吳越間］（與趙無錫）之不足更廣游東南以恢復他原先的狂放不覊的精神</p>
<p>袁中郎就這樣的做了一回官官的滋味在他所體騐到的不過如此而已這［如此而已］在下走簡略叙述了全部的經過又一再補充了後讀者總可以看到了罷記得在中學時讀宗臣的］報劉一丈書］對於他所形容的奔走權門的一些小官僚準官僚的醜態感到寫得眞是淋漓盡致不過那文字祗是令人生增惡之心··若中郎的自白却使人在對官僚卑劣的憎惡而外另得着一種奇趣現代的一些官大人此當時的［牛馬走［更高的很是不少下走雖也耳熟能詳究竟才力不足不能再寫一篇［官臉譜］此文之作頗希望引起一班大作家的興味能繼［官塲現形記］而後再來一部［革命的官塲現形記］也謹拭目以待之</p>
<h3>神女（三）</h3>
<p>— 侍桁</p>
<p>我索性展開了信紙預備寫信給我的一個老友我在最煩悶的時候一向是把我的心情訴給我的最親愛的人的。</p>
<p>她倒在床上還是張着眼睛望着我停了一會兒她敲敲床邊向我招呼表示了要我也來睡的意思我還是用微笑回答她手裏拿着筆作着手勢告訴她你先睡吧我還要寫呢她再拍拍床我仍是作着同樣的手勢於是她没有法想帶着怒意轉過身去睡了</p>
<p>没有一分鐘的問隔她已經甜蜜地熟睡着了從她的鼾聲裏我可以曉得這個可憐的女子曾是怎樣地疲倦了啊</p>
<p>寫完了信桌上的表已經指在夜二時了那臥在床上的不幸的人恐怕早就到了　遥的遥遥的夢鄉裏吧她的身體幾乎整個裸露在被外那乾柴似的兩條腿那露着明顯的助骨的瘠疲的胸那蒼白貧血的面孔使我看清楚人類的不可容赦的罪惡。</p>
<p>我坐在床邊望着她可是我怎麽辦呢我也睡倒在這同一個床裏伴着　過了這不愉快的夜麽而且在半睡眠的狀態裏我不會再被淫慾的火所叹支配嗎</p>
<p>我輕輕地摇摇她的身體她不體··我再摇她還不醒於是我呌着［醒醒吧醒醒吧！］</p>
<p>像是在夢中被夢魔捉住了似地她猛地醒轉來惺忪的眼一看見我又作出了微笑</p>
<p>但這微笑眞是說不出地勉强在任何時候任何心境下對於任何人都非笑不可的這可憐的賣笑的生涯笑已往成了一種習慣一種痛苦的習慣在她的笑裹是洩露着怎樣的人簡的凄慘啊</p>
<p>起來穿衣服］我說着把衣服遞給她她實在還没有完全醒</p>
<p>［怎麽你呌我走麽］她發着氣說</p>
<p>我不曉得怎樣回答她</p>
<p>［你不中意我呀］她覺到難堪的侮辱似地呌着</p>
<p>［不是的不是的因爲天已經很晚我自已要睡了］我還是　出笑容對她說</p>
<p>我雖然可憐她同情她不忍得對於她再加上一分人類的摧殘可是她不能夠理解我這憐憫這同情她是當作侮辱而接受了</p>
<p>當她走出了我同屋門我喘了一口大氣那壓在心上的重荷馬上就輕减了許多急忙熄滅了燈倒在床裏但是我不能夠睡那遣留在被裡的一種剌人鼻孔的難聞的氣味以及方才演過的這塲戲還是在我的腦裡作崇</p>
<p>不但是那一夜其後許久我總在回憶着這塲喜　劇·的確在外表上這幕劇是滑稽的有時自已想着都要笑起來可是我從來没有笑過兩三聲因爲在滑稽的背面它却含着酸苦的滋味　是人類很少經騐得到的一幕最悲慘的喜劇。　　一九三三年九月</p>

<p>談言</p>
<p>關於敎師的話　　厚·英</p>
<p>我不是一個敎師，而且恨本也没有做一個敎師的資格但是我今天却要對一般敎師說幾句話。</p>
<p>我是一個時常感覺到自已學識淺陋的青年今年初秋我的求智慾熱烈地騙使着我於是在許許多日夜夜招收新生的廣告之下我竭力從别椿用度上節省下十塊錢來到一個自已認爲較滿意的補習夜絞裏報了名但是開學後一星期二星期貶貶眼已過去了除一個英文敎師之外其餘的我覺得却不能使我們有多大的進步當這幾位敎師們上課時全班同學們的眼珠似乎全都蒙上了一重黯黄的光彩他們的精神顯然地不及上英文課時活潑而有趣味了··我們知道［興趣］是一個無論什麽事業中的主要問題娱樂之所以能引誘人不是爲了它有興趣麽如讀書當然更應該使得學生們感到有戀戀不捨的興趣然而我能夠保證他們無興趣上其餘的幾課决不是爲了書本的不良也决不是爲了學生個失夫工他們的求智慾丨因爲在開學時副校長說··［······在這個補習夜校裹我知道每一個學生的求學的動機却是自動而不是被動的······］這幾句話的　說得很透澈丨不是說一句冒昧的話我相信還是這幾位先生們自已的敎法不行</p>
<p>一個敎師是不是只要有相當的學問便可以敎書了麽不這是錯的至少敎一個小學生也不可以只照書本上呆呆的解說一遍然而有一般敎師們却歸告於經騐不足當然經騐也是要緊的可是他們没有想到什麽是比經騐更需要而且所　經騐也　不是每天照書本解說一通便能得到的今天逾越了我自已的範園而對一般敎師們說幾句我歷年求學時所得的感念··</p>
<p>（一）敎師們應該保守他個人的人格敎師們雖然除上課外很少與學生接屬然而他的一舉一動影響於學生們很大··假使這敎師没有人格道德直接能使學生們也變成一個無道德的人間接也能使學生們對於他的言語失去了信仰雖然他以後想對學生們說幾句冠冕正大的話然而結果必定會使他更失望反之假使這一校中的敎師們却能保守他們完美的人格丨不假使僅僅只有一個我相信這一校的風氣必然要好得多這一校學生們的智識道德也必然要好得多了因爲人的本心總是歡喜［眞善］而厭惡［僞惡］的啊</p>
<p>（二）敎師們應該充分明瞭書中的意義與學生的疑問自然一個當敎師的决不會不明瞭書本中的意義的但是要［充分］的明瞭却又是另外一件事情了這［充分］兩字不是指書上死的刻板的意義乃是要敎師們自已到别的書上去找出各種各式的解釋來穿挿進去使得學生們聽了以後腦中自然有一個極明顯的印象存在着但同時學生們又必然都是好發疑問的只要他間的不錯敎師們應該用極簡短易記的言語去解答他不然也應該糾正他的錯誤古人曰··［大疑則太進］因爲你很精潔明瞭地解答了他之後他必定不會像平時一般的忽略遇去那麽這一叚學問就是他自已的而不是書本上的了</p>
<p>（二）敎師們應該時常使學生們有練習的機會雖然敎師所敎的書已能使學生們注意而且在腦中留下一個印像了但是印象究竟是印象免逐漸模糊以至於無所以敎師們應該時常編些練習題等類的問題使得學生</p>
<p>們不斷地有練習的機會這樣在五六年之内我相信可以不會忘記的因爲我自已就是一個榜樣</p>
<p>最後我還要說一句關於我們學生的話··我們自已也應該努力向上·不要忘了什麽是我到們學校裏來的目的因爲求學究竟不是敎師們單方面的事情啊</p>
<p>戀　　一·蘋·</p>
<p>菲病了她的來信說我悶的慌你怎不到我這裏來談呢當茜出病院的時候她無邪地說過··［生病多少是藝術的我也想去住住醫院哩］但是病魔降臨到這無愁公主的玉體上時她也感覺到我悶的慌你怎不到我這裏來談談呢··我於是不得不抽出功夫來在一個秋的下午坐車到霞飛路去</p>
<p>菲是一個豪放的少女丨或在她自已　有承認過是一個女子半年前在一個結婚的禮堂上爲了我們男女債相的關係由新郎的介紹而認識了就在認識後的第一個星期日她突然到我的小樓來我的小樓中正蜂擁着一羣半失業的朋友她就參加進我們的一羣談笑打趣晚餐時更喝了多量的酒她醉了在醉後的話語中她談着她自已的身世··她是四川人她不知道自已的生身父母獨自兒在上海已十多年了她大學　有畢業現在一個洋行任書記兼打字之職她有很多的錢可以消毁</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>她的青春。</p>
<p>菲終於是一個女子，她感到青春的老去，在醉後她是眞情地吐出她底心的深處的悲哀。她哭着，說話的喉音是模糊，當我們詢問她住址的時候，她已不知道說話。我這小樓的主人，當時不知怎樣對付這局面，我不知道她的住寓，將這醉後的人送到那裏去呢？朋友們却一個個溜走了，我不得已布地板上睡了一夜。第二天她清醒過來，她說她太不知禮貌，昨夜定是十分放浪，請我原諒她佔據了我臥處，於是我們的交情更深一層，過從也日密。但是菲自已雖不承認是女子，她終久是一個感到青春老去底悲哀的女子，我深悔太不知女子的情感，我竟打動了她少女的心弦。在不久以前，我覺得我們已踏上危險之路，我放棄了我小樓的地盤，每天在馬路上跑，或在到朋友家中去閒坐，强迫着自已避免一觸即發的形勢，不見菲已一個月了。</p>
<p>到霞飛路，俄國太太堆着笑臉說着不純粹的中國話，說我好久不來了，小孩子忙着什麽事？她拍着我的肩胛，我從不見她有過這般的情形，也微微着跑上樓去。</p>
<p>菲開着麥唐娜在璇宫艶史中一舉成名的夢中情人清遣，這無愁公主的夢中情人已唱得很夠味，她還開唱片來消遣，她是如何的寂寞着呢！聽見我的脚步聲，她在臥室門口接我，穿着一襲睡衣，頭髮多紋的披着，面上薄敷脂粉，含着捲烟，態度即那樣地　閒，一點没有病的象徵。</p>
<p>［你病着啊？］我不由驚奇地問了</p>
<p>［誰病着］</p>
<p>一同踏進她的臥室一個月不見室内更收捨得清幽對沙發的壁上掛了一張她新照的十二寸照像踏進這樣的臥室我想起自已的那小樓來怪自已太疏懶糟眞得太不成模樣菲笑着授給我一支捲烟　嬌嬌地反問我</p>
<p>［你信上不說悶的慌嗎］</p>
<p>［我說悶的慌　没有說生病啊］</p>
<p>我們半年來從不見她矯揉做作的媚態　她駡女子撤嬌是太不要臉她是那樣的率直　她自已不承認是個女子今天她一反常態不過矯柔做作的媚態對於菲確覺得她比平時特别可愛的地方來</p>
<p>我僅是笑笑坐到沙發上注意着她的照像我想着我的小樓中掛着這麽一張多美麗啊</p>
<p>［噲不願意到這裏來嗎？］</p>
<p>［你怎知道的？］</p>
<p>［爲什麽老不說話呢？］呌你來談談的啊！］</p>
<p>［我愛這張像片］</p>
<p>［送給你］她孩子一般的忙跳到凳上去把鏡框移下來用一張美麗的花紙包了授給我［你愛她就送給你］</p>
<p>望着她笑的酒渦我知道她誤會了我的話但是我能聲明僅僅是愛這張像片嗎·愛一張美的女子的像片你能說出其他的理由嗎</p>
<p>［我僅是心中愛着牠可不能掛到我的破樓中去</p>
<p>菲並坐到沙發上將組包靠在身邊她默默無語一顆處女的純潔的心被一個劊子手解剖着而這劊子手是她追求着的情人我望着她痛苦的臉撫着她的手說</p>
<p>［菲不必悲痛我和你一樣悲痛的事多着哩丨我們何必再自尋煩惱？我們的心已凝結在一處形式的有無有什麽關係呢！</p>
<p>［Ｘ不知什麽緣故自見了你之後我的心　　了朋友］非含着眼淚說丨［望你愛這張像　如愛我的人　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　如今那張美麗的像片掛在我的小樓中了！我的　集　　　　　　　　自來替我佈置的臨行她對我說··［請你保持這像片的純潔有閒還是到我那邊來談談過去是過去的了·不必牢記着這些丨她笑着走了</p>
<p>在一個秋雨的晚上我呆視着她的像片和她臨行時一般的笑着但是我能望見她笑背面的泣哭我剌傷了菲的純潔的心靈我屹立在窗前聽秋雨賣駡我的無情我的失落的心往何處去尋呢　　談剌激　　厚·英·</p>
<p>剌激兩字當然是廣義而不是狹義的但是於精神或身體上同樣受一個打激則一也我相信在每一個有生命的動物受着了剌激之後他們緊隨着在這後面的思想必然是［希望］一隻鷄被我們抓住了它的翅膀之時它唯一的希望便是能掙扎着逃走一隻虎被被我們打傷了之後它的希望便是想撲殺它的敵人·，被認爲下等動物的尚且如此那未我們所謂萬物之靈的人類自然是更應該在受到了剌激之後懷有比下等動物一類高明十倍的希望了丨</p>
<p>因爲有人說過希望是一個黑暗路上的明燈而我也以爲希望能增加人生的趣味大約希望之爲人生所不可缺少的已無疑義了但是希望是並不能平空無感觸地産生的於是造成希望的剌激便也成爲人生的要素了我們歡喜讀武俠的偵探的小說歡喜看野獸的恐怖的影片無他不過想在這平淡無聊的生活中受一些剌激而已往極度的侮辱之下我們會希望報復在　酷的壓迫之下我們會希望反抗這大槪是全世界的人類甚至於獸類所公認的一個最普偏的公式吧</p>
<p>但是我們［精神文明］的中國人却太把這剌激的範圍看得狹小了我們在書上看到的只有爲父復仇的孝子剪好剷暴的俠盜而在事實上却更連這二種都没有照理說我們中國在國際地位上的勢力最弱受别人侮辱壓迫的機會最多當然我們中國人在這重重的剌激之下應該個個人對於自已的國空都有一個很大的希望但是不然除了極少數極少數之外我可以說没有一個人懂得國家兩字的意義他們能在敵人侮蔑的眼光下爭買賤價的貨物他們能在敵人的剌刀之下踐踏自已的同胞剌激旣然無動於心希望自然也無從而生了！反之··他們對於自已個人的利益却看得十分重要中華民族的現象實在是太可怕太可悲了</p>
<p>我們中國的同胞請你們把眼光放得大一些罷請你們認識廣義的剌激不要專在狹義的剌激範圍中打轉了</p>

<p>誰都有些懷疑阿水的生意竟赢了利阿永竟成了一個富翁</p>
<p>間壁的一爿綢緞店四季懸掛着拍賣的布幕實際上確實是很便宜比如從前要角錢一尺的印花布現在却只掛牌八分錢一尺了而且是買一尺送一尺簡直比從前便宜一半多但生意也還是那麽清淡清淡到門可羅雀不能維持下去就像對角的一家南貨店也是年比年衰落了大家都能意識到這是經濟恐慌的嘲弄所致大衆都在［窮］的獰牙下喘息的不能度活自然一般的購買是如水之就下一天天的降落了</p>
<p>惟獨阿永是一個勝利者在這一條闊馬路上</p>
<p>這點在裁縫出身從没有進過學堂坐過冷板凳的阿永自已也有些茫然到只覺得一個人的［否］［秦］［窮］［通］全是八字中的命運註定的小時候有過一個老算命瞎子說他在三十的年頭上是會走上好運致富巨萬而且不足發意外的横財是從經商做買賣得來他　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　的裁縫起家立業了</p>
<p>十五年　　　　　　　　　　才籌得百隻洋租定一間衖堂房子說是做軍服生意自已除了要在家裏打招呼還要到外面去拉生意不過另外還有幾位帮手却不料出了大批的貨色竟簡直無人問津於是阿永很着急他常時帶着一顆顫抖的心去翻看成堆的軍服的下層有没有蟲傷有没有潮霉可幸算好只是貨積如山全無出路成本層層的壓下去畢竟也不是辦法阿永晦氣了常對一些克勤克儉的帮手無事冒火生氣連帮手們也跟帶没興頭了</p>
<p>然而阿永究竟財星高照後來他全不出門兜攬生意反而有人上門來看貨了於是就全數高價生了脫售</p>
<p>阿永的臉堆滿了紅的雲朶帮手們也全都笑逐顔開大家都活生生大家都熱窩着心向這道鴻運挺進追索他第三年衖堂房子不敷用了於是阿永把門楣扯開來頂了一幢寬敝的市房　　　　　宏大的作廠於是小小的一方鉛皮［阿永軍服號］的招牌也就一變而成了　　　　　　　　　　　　　　横牌吊珠似的電炬通宵的閃映着阿永幾個大字在綢緞店的間壁南貨店的對角</p>
<p>這麽一來大家都知道了他的名號生意起發好起來軍服一車一車的輸出去上火車上輪船銀元也就一車一車的拖回來進保險櫃進銀行阿永成了資本家</p>
<p>十九年阿永剛剛三十歲這才知道算命的話果然不錯［否］［泰］［窮］［通］原來如此</p>
<p>但阿永做這生意也一向有着他的［麥克］以外的一種希望就是他知道軍服的需用日增自然軍隊也日增自然外國人也不敢輕易來欺侮了我們有大批的軍隊好去抵抗豈知這竟像一個燦</p>
<p>爛的夢他貼切的領味到當滬戰時就只聽見十幾路軍十幾路軍彷彿中國的軍隊就只有那麽一點點於是不得不慘敗但軍漲的需要却仍是日增不減這在阿永是一個　　　　　永遠是一個　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　阿永在茫然的謎弄中發着［勝利的</p>

<p>諸位先生··</p>
<p>屢見你們替人解决困難我實在欽佩萬分兹有一事敬煩先生詳細解答感激不盡！</p>
<p>我在二十歲時由媒妁之介紹許字一姓周男子因爲我的父母還是一種舊禮敎的人物所以訂婚時我亦一些没有知道迨至前年該男子忽患病去世當時我的親友們都不主張我到男家去守節所以至今未有實行最近那男子的父母忽然想接我過去據說是因爲家裏没人甚爲寂寞想我倍伴他們而且他倆表示非常歡迎說我如果肯去則衣食固然無憂且當我親女一樣看待現在我的父母都贊成祗等待我的决斷吧了因此我便彷徨着不曉得怎樣才好？因爲他們雖然說是衣食無憂但滄海桑田萬一他們日後經濟發生問題時我的苦况也就可想而知了··並且他倆現年已老所謂［自古人生誰無死］一旦相繼去世後那豈不是把我的青春一年一年地斷送去嗎？還有當他們追念着兒子的不幸時或者祭祀的辰光你能坐視而不流一點同情之淚嗎？</p>
<p>說到我呢我粗通文字而且家事和剌繡等非常有經騐所以我决意不結婚將來一有機會便出來社會服務若没有機會我便在家服侍父母工作度日我想這樣比較到陌生的親人那裏去（因爲他倆我從未會面所以我祇能說是陌生的親人）度這枯寂的歲月要安樂得多了？</p>
<p>現在請先生們替我解答下列疑問··</p>
<p>（一）我現在决意不到男家去我應用何種方法對父母解釋？</p>
<p>（二）若我不去那未又辜負了他倆一番誠意我又應拿甚麽來向他倆說個明白？</p>
<p>（三）來日方長我應找何種工作來維持我的生活？（我的父母並不富有所以我想馬上出來謀生）</p>
<p>上列數點務請先生們眞的能於最短時間内一一詳細解答則感恩之深銘泐五中矣！</p>

<h3>驚人的自殺統計</h3>
<p>— 炳</p>
<p>好萊塢繁華的背象</p>
<p>據美國加利福尼亞警務機關調查報告，一九三二年好來塢影界人物在好萊塢自殺者共一百二十餘人，平均每二日有一人自殺，而其中以經濟困難而自殺者占百分之八十五，以失戀婚變等而自殺者占百分之五，其他原因不明者百分之十。照遵個統計看來，前傳法國著名評劇家洛尼博稱好萊塢蔣有經濟危機之說，於此更可證實，在珠光寳氣，粉腿肉林的好萊塢，尙且有這種可怖的事件發生，無怪世界經濟要恐慌了。</p>
<p>加利福尼亞的警務機關報告中云，一九三二年的影界人物自殺　多之處，在好萊塢近郊的賽可橋ＡrroysＳecoＢridge上，這架橋是旱橋，離地一百五十呎高，計一年中從橋頂躍下墮地而死的影界人物達五十六人警廳待派警官在橋上巡邏，以阻止自殺者，然仍有於深夜赴橋上自殺者，故大家都稽這橋爲［自殺橋］ＳuicideＢridge</p>
<p>在皮佛萊山脚下雷電華公司的百代ＲＫＯ攝影場旁邊有一個Ｈollywoodland十三個字母連成的大電炬，在旁邊有一架梯子離地有五十呎高。在一九三二年中，電影明星因失意不得志而爮上去墮地自殺的亦有好幾個。第一個想出這樣自殺的是曾在百老匯紅極一時而在好萊塢潦倒窮途的潘格恩偉索ＢegＥntwistl。。申報電影專刋在去年曾詳記其事現事。自從潘格自殺後下數日即有效她的方法以自殺者。後更有多人自殺於該處，現警廳已派遣警官長駐該處守候云。</p>
<p>此外赴旅館服毒以自殺者亦屬不少。如康斯登李格ConStanceLygo，曾在銀壇　顯赫一時，愛麗斯潘勃登ＡliceＰembertcn，曾被人讚做影界之罕有人物，都因爲時乖運蹇，而趨入自殺之路。最可憐的是愛梅哈麗孟ＬrmaHarriman和格奈娓麗登ＧenevieveＴeritan二人，她二人同時到好萊塢，同時漸露頭角，同時遭失敗。二人的經濟一樣困難，於是同病相憐，在一起服毒自殺，並遣言　囑葬於一處之句，令人聞之酸惻。</p>
<p>其他用煤　自殺者爲格戴柯爾門ＫittyＣoliman。紐約的女明星，在好萊塢用手槍自戕者則僅保羅博恩ＰaulＰern一人。保羅的自殺，情　十分離奇，有謂保羅爲琪恩哈羅而犧牲，然加利福尼亞的警務機關調查，則謂與其他經濟問題有　。然究竟如何，非局外人所能知矣。</p>
<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3>［殘春］評</h3>
<p>— 朱耐彤</p>
<p>這錯踪複雜的社會，潛伏每個人們貪婪的慾望自私的心理而含孕着無限的危機正是一方面是柔和的熱情享樂的狂歡而牠的另一方面呢就是悲哀的墮落幻滅的痛苦殘春寫一個貴奢的女子因爲是有財有貌而没有正確的憧憬澈透的思想祇知道暫時的享樂縱情的狂放而不知道世途的荆棘故如處處觸發了地雷而毁滅了自已在故事上是暴露了社會一部份的罪惡　　全劇的結構顯示出都是她片面地狂熱的追求與無懲的慾望而處處給予人家的誘惑是財色這悲慘的結果是應有的事實不過一個不把變愛看重的交際花而結果成忠於變愛的犧牲者使人總覺不能相信轉變得似乎太快雖然司以說她由於經過的敎訓急切的悔悟但在書面顯示總覺不夠這是劇本的不能完整</p>
<p>導演的手法圓熟聰明的地方也有如梅麗宴客的分梨金母的唸佛均暗示出她的心理與家庭的腐敗而使</p>
<p>一個冷靜的塲面熱鬧不少惟開始的幾個塲面太覺鬆懈抓不住觀衆的情緒使不覺得沉悶足球比賽演來踢法不清晰不像熱烈的球戰試浴是電影藝術裏的舊套似乎是多此一舉　　演員都很努力而演出極佳尤是徐來在影迷的熱望下都得到美好的印象表情眞切而適合没有更深的努力定有更大的成功於將來龔稼農演來亦好一個忠實的戀愛者是他的本來面目鄭小秋孫敵演來均自然活潑使全劇生色不少總之這是明星公司進步的一張好片（缺章却酬）</p>
<h3>殘春觀後感</h3>

<p>丨丨表面上，也爲了守中的忠告而變更了她的生活的形式。事實上，這並不是自已的覺悟而祇是爲要抓住守中的歡愛。</p>

<p>她知道了守中已經有了妻子，而且他們夫婦很相愛好。她也絶不灰心。她經騐太多了··她以爲，凡是在戀愛事件中，女人總得到最後的勝利的·，還有金錢的力量哩。她不相信守中不能屬於她。何况，守中還對他說過離婚結婚都應該絶對自由呢！</p>
<p>但守中是始終没有愛着她，他有摰愛的妻和摰愛的孩子，他還有事業的向上心，他和梅　是始終不舍結合的。梅麗却更加露骨地向他表示。最後還直截爽快地說出了她自已的願望，希望守中跟他的妻子離婚。</p>
<p>［你不是說過離婚結婚都自由的嗎？］她說。</p>
<p>［可是，在這裏，自由不能還樣解釋啊！］他回答。</p>

<h3>評［殘春］</h3>
<p>— 其然</p>
<p>（上略）全劇的演出，雖很平淡，而却能令人看了兩個鐘頭而不覺得有甚厭倦。可是，導演若能不這樣草率而稍爲努力些的話，我想必更能使觀衆增多一點興趣。好像王律師和陸思德及警察們在旅館裏拯救梅麗和梅麗因不得守中允許她的請求而致［自殺］的兩塲，實在做得鬆懈極了。諸如此類的小疵點，還很多，不暇再舉。總之，不外是導演的［草率］所致。他如梅麗在洗沐時的那幾個鏡頭，實不應要。我想這也是導演者欲仿傚美國片的緣故吧了！</p>
<p>說到演員，徐來表演那些浪漫行爲及媚態都很好，而在悲傷時的表情，就不大逼眞了。這也許是生活體騐和銀幕經騐的缺乏所致吧。可是，徐女士確是一可造之材，望徐女士自已及導演先生們注意，鄭小秋由［好乖乖］而變成拆白黨後，在這裏已稍有進步。雖則仍不免有點做作。龔稼農最好，那老到的表演工夫，實不多得。</p>

<p>當根發領着孤兒走進大義家中時，大義正背着槍頂備上火線去，根發被大義的正義鼓勵着，滿腔的抗敵的情緒高張起來。他拍着大義的肩膀說··［大義·我們一齊上火線去！］</p>
<p>根發便把他的兒子托了大義的母親代他照顧，於是提起了槍彈走向前線去。</p>
<p>在槍林彈雨的砲火中，在黑烟如霧的烟幕彈中，在咯咯作響的機關槍掩護之下，根發見民敵人的便衣隊正在襲擊逃難的難民。根發躱藏在斷垣瓦礫中槍殺了六七個敵人，救助了無數的難民，他背着難民中年高殘疾和失去了父母的孤兒逃出火線。但是，他没有料到在那些被救助的難民中，發見了殺害過他的父親和妻子的仇人耿大道，根發，時償恨交併，便要殺死他。大道也以爲必死，嚇得汗流如注地面無人色了。但是根發忽然回轉了意議，他說一殺敵人的槍，不應該拿來報復私仇。］</p>

<h3>Austrian New Draft Constitution</h3>
<p>▲ Four New Assemblies to Replace Parliament</p>
<p>Vienna, today's newspapers report that Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss and Interior Minister Ender have drafted a new constitution, which will serve as the basis for a corporate Austrian state. The old parliament will be replaced by four new assemblies: (1) the National Assembly, (2) the Group Assembly, (3) the Federal Assembly, and (4) the Supreme State Council. The National Assembly will have eighty-eight elected representatives, roughly allocated according to the old system by the various parties. Voting rights will be amended, with the right to vote only granted to those over thirty years of age. Certain groups will also be granted collective voting rights. The Group Assembly will be elected by economic and professional organizations, cooperatives, chambers of commerce, agricultural societies, etc., with an equal number of seats for employers and employees. The Federal Assembly will be composed of two representatives from each of the nine federal states. The Supreme State Council will be organized by twenty people appointed by the President. In the future, Austrian laws will first need to be passed by the National Assembly and then approved by the Group Assembly. It is said that the various measures of the National Assembly may be jointly vetoed by the other three assemblies.</p>

<p>Hitler Emphasizes Agriculture</p>
<p>Legislation Designates Farmers as a Specially Privileged Class</p>
<p>(Berlin) Today, German Chancellor Hitler approved a revolutionary agricultural law, designating farmers as a specially privileged class in the nation, as they are the backbone of the Germanic people. Any farmer who wishes to enjoy this privilege must prove that they are a skilled farmer and a citizen of Germanic descent, without any mixing with Jews or people of color since 1800. Their arable land and forest land, if not exceeding 310 acres, cannot be divided among their descendants, nor can it be sold or mortgaged. (2nd Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The central government promulgated a new law concerning "hereditary estates." The rationale states that farmers are the source of the German national bloodline, and "estates" should be protected by the state to prevent excessive fragmentation. Estates that are too large should be rationally distributed, but the land given to each farmer, which is designated as indivisible, must have an area of at least 12,500 square meters. In the future, only the owners of "estates" can be called farmers; other landowners will only be called cultivators. Moreover, only those of German race and German descent can acquire farmer status. The new law stipulates that farmers must strictly provide proof of Germanic and Aryan ancestry. All those who inherit property after October 1, 1933, will be subject to the various provisions of the new law. (2nd Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Today's German government gazette reported on the characteristics of the new law on land inheritance. The basic idea of the law is to recognize 125 hectares (312 acres) of land or forest as hereditary property that should belong to those capable of cultivating it. The owners of such hereditary property are called farmers. According to the law, they must be German or of Germanic descent and of good character. After death, the property must be inherited by one person indivisibly. Other heirs only have the right to live and eat together with the inheritor. Descendants of farmers who are not to inherit the land must be given a specialized profession or skill so they can make a living, and they should be provided with the perfect equipment to practice their profession. If these descendants are impoverished, they may still return home to live together, and their inheritance rights will not be restricted or cancelled by death. The inherited property may not be sold or mortgaged. (2nd National Telegram)</p>
<p>British Labour Party Meeting</p>
<p>Decides to Fight Fascism</p>
<p>(London) The British Labour Party held a meeting in Hastings today. Chairman Poulton declared that the Labour Party should fight Fascism with a spirit of fearlessness and without retreat. He believes that Fascism and Communism are both enemies of the labour democracy system. The report of the executive committee, which referred to certain groups as communist movements and recommended that they be rejected, provoked criticism from the leaders of the Marley and Wilkinson factions. Morrison, a former cabinet member of the Labour government, stated that if the executive committee felt it necessary to apply discipline, it should deal with anyone, whether they are nobles or parliamentary candidates, in the same way. It is expected that former Attorney General Cripps will join the war tomorrow, intending to amend the policies of the executive committee. The points of contention are whether the Labour Party should advocate the immediate abolition of the House of Lords and advocate the passage of an emergency powers act so that the government can implement any plan by order. At the same time, the executive committee is currently drafting a bill advocating the nationalization of the Bank of England and advocating a large-scale movement to have Prime Minister MacDonald submit all important resolutions to the party for review. Another noteworthy point is that at the meeting on Sunday, various Labour Party organizations expressed opposition to the control of the Trade Union Congress. Meanwhile, the Conservative Party is actively preparing for a crucial meeting to be held in Birmingham on Thursday and Friday. In addition to those who oppose the government's Indian policy, there is also a faction that opposes MacDonald and Baldwin, who now want to restore the Conservative Party's original freedom of action. However, calm critics warn the extremist factions of all parties that the results of the 1931 election were an expression of the nation's dislike of partisan politics and a willingness to prioritize the nation.

<p>American Recovery Suffers Setbacks</p>
<p>Reports of the Executive Director Resigning</p>
<p>Spreading Labour Unrest Is the Greatest Difficulty</p>
<p>(Washington) Although President Roosevelt strongly advocates national unity, rumours here suggest that National Recovery Administration Executive Director General Johnson will resign. Johnson went to New York today to discuss the policies of the Recovery Administration with President Roosevelt. The biggest difficulty currently encountered is the increase in strikes, with labour unrest spreading so widely that it could impede food supplies. The latest development is the protest of famous film actors and actresses, who oppose the organization of the salary management committee as stated in the industry regulations. Fourteen famous stars have left the film industry. Although there is labour unrest in New York, the local mediation committee has resolved disputes involving 30,000 workers in the week since its establishment. (3rd Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>American Labour Unrest Spreads</p>
<p>Panic Gradually Arises Over Food in New York</p>
<p>More Than 20,000 Ford Factory Workers Unemployed</p>
<p>(New York) The food supply in New York is now gradually being threatened due to the spread of labour unrest, and the coal industry dispute has not yet been resolved. Today, 17,000 truck drivers went on strike, demanding a five-day work week while being paid for six days. According to a truck union official, the truck shutdown has prevented 75,000 bags of flour from circulating. The Ford Motor Company plant in Edgewater, New Jersey, has now been shut down, leaving 25,000 factory workers unemployed. In Detroit, Flint, and Pontiac, 12,000 tool and die makers are on strike. The coal mining industry regulations came into effect today, but more than 100,000 steel and coal industry workers in Pennsylvania, Indiana, and West Virginia have not yet returned to work. The Attorney General has instructed federal prosecutors not to prosecute those who violate industry regulations. (2nd Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) The American Federation of Labor held its annual meeting here today. The executive committee has drafted a bill advocating the amendment of existing industry regulations to ensure wage increases and the realization of a 30-hour work week. AFL President Green told the delegates at the meeting that there are currently 11 million unemployed people, and work may not be obtained until this issue is effectively resolved. The current situation requires six hours of work per day and five days per week. (3rd Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Inflationary Currency Will Not Be Implemented</p>
<p>(New York) The US President's delay in announcing monetary policy has led to a flurry of rumors from outside. The financial community sees many positives. It is almost certain that Washington will announce something to hinder the publication of monetary policy. Today, Federation of Labor President Green stated that inflationary currency would raise prices. Since no one can guarantee higher wages, inflationary currency would only immediately increase the cost of living, without any compensatory increase in wages on the salary side. According to Green, who serves as a labour advisor to the Industrial Recovery Administration, most opponents of inflationary currency believe that this ultimately represents the government's view. Furthermore, economic expert Babson reported on the state of commerce, also stating that advocates of extreme inflation are short-sighted. The people and the business community should not be discouraged about the recovery plan, because although progress in restoring the price level to the 1926 level is slow, the state of commerce is good. Although prices have fallen slightly since July, the price index for September is still 78. Although this is slightly less than the 89 for July, it is still significantly higher than the 65 during the same period last year. (2nd National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) US Senator Wheeler gave a radio speech tonight, asking the people to support his bill to remonetize silver at a ratio of sixteen to one with gold, saying that only this can prevent the danger of inflationary paper money, raise world prices, and encourage America's Far East trade.

<p>Roosevelt Addresses Veterans</p>
<p>(Chicago) This afternoon, American veterans held a convention here. President Roosevelt delivered a speech, asking for help with his recovery movement. He said, "You once served in the military in uniform. Now, I ask you to re-enlist. I am your commander-in-chief and comrade, and I deeply hope that you will repay me." President Roosevelt's speech did not mention currency inflation or foreign affairs, but he warned the public that the complete realization of the recovery movement may not be achieved within six months. President Roosevelt continued, "Restoring work is only proceeding in part. Week after week, there are ups and downs, but the result is still gradually improving. Credit debts are no longer stagnant and are definitely gradually circulating. Farmers' incomes have now increased slightly, but they still need to increase more. I hope that greater efforts will be made in the future to ensure that the recovery movement achieves complete success." The President spoke of national credit, earnestly discussing the importance of national unity, saying, "We are now dealing with real things, not theories in books. If the government goes bankrupt, industry cannot recover, people cannot get their jobs, banks cannot open, and human suffering cannot be alleviated. We now understand that the great value of all the people of America is tied to the completely undamaged credit of the United States. If the government cannot restore the government's credit, how can banks open for business?" The President also said that the government is still responsible for soldiers disabled in battle, but they should not expect the government to grant them special benefits that exceed those of other citizens simply because they enlisted.

<p>League of Nations to Handle the Chaco War</p>
<p>Decides to Send a Board of Arbitrators</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Commission today decided to send a board of arbitrators to South America to end the war between Bolivia and Paraguay. The arbitrators were initially appointed in May, but then agreed to the request of the South American Neutral Committee, led by Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Peru, to first attempt arbitration under the supervision of the League of Nations. As a result, the arbitrators' journey was delayed. Now that the representatives of the neutral countries have failed to end the war, the League of Nations Commission has decided to send the board of arbitrators. However, it is uncertain whether the various members still wish to go to South America at this time. Telegrams have been sent to solicit their opinions. If any member is unable to travel due to unforeseen circumstances, new members will be appointed. After the members depart, they plan to reside in the capital of Brazil and invite representatives from the warring countries to meet. Although both Bolivia and Paraguay have accepted the principle of arbitration, Paraguay wants arbitration after the ceasefire, while Bolivia wants a ceasefire after arbitration.

<p>Robbery Near Pan-yang</p>
<p>Train to Newchwang Robbed</p>
<p>Passengers' Money and Belongings Stolen</p>
<p>Dozens Killed, Wounded, and Kidnapped</p>
<p>(Tokyo) News from Pan-yang received here today: Yesterday afternoon, the notorious bandit leader Su Hai (transliteration) led his men to intercept the train from Kou-pang-tzu to Newchwang near Tien-chuang-tai. After the train was stopped, the bandits opened fire on the carriages, killing one passenger, seriously wounding twenty-three, and slightly injuring dozens. The bandits then boarded the train, robbed the passengers of all their money and belongings, and kidnapped twenty passengers. Bandit leader Su Hai haunts Manchuria, repeatedly committing robberies. The authorities have made great efforts to capture him, but have failed. It is said that Su is no less than the ruler of a "small country." The taxes within his territory are very light, so the people are happy to join him but also fear him like a tiger. Su robbed a train on the same route on June 18 this year, kidnapping more than a hundred passengers. None have been released, and their fate is unknown. The location of this robbery is on the railway that connects Kou-pang-tzu on the Peking-Mukden Railway with Ta-shih-chiao on the South Manchuria Railway, a route approximately seventy miles long.

The Second Company of the Second Regiment of the Hopeh Provincial Government's Security Force, which was originally stationed in Ma-lan-yu, has retreated to Tsun-hua. [It is heard that the Japanese army in Jehol also plans to send] a regiment to be stationed in Chi county, but they have not yet arrived. (3rd)</p>

<p>(Nanking) Executive Yuan President Wang telegraphed Ku Chu-tung in Chen-chiang on the 3rd, saying, "Your telegram of the 30th has been received. Brother, you have managed the Kiangsu government with great diligence. Recently, you have also been appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Northern Route Bandit Suppression in Kiangsi, Kwangtung, Fukien, Hunan, and Hupeh. With your great plans and strategies, you are a pillar of the nation. Leaving a large burden and taking on a difficult task is a responsibility for an extraordinary person. Kiangsu's governance relies on your talents, but given the heavy responsibility and the difficulty of juggling multiple roles, I must follow your request. It has been decided to present a request and issue an order approving your resignation. I hope that you will move your troops west to clear away the bandit scourge to comfort the gentry and people of the five provinces. This telegram is to inform you and to convey my greetings to the various committee members and directors. Please forgive me for not answering each one individually." (3rd Special Telegram)</p>

<p>Inner Mongolian Prince Te and the Japanese Are in Collusion</p>
<p>Huang Shao-hsiung's Departure Date Is Undecided</p>
<p>(Nanking) A certain agency received a telegram reporting on the Inner Mongolian princes organizing an autonomous body. An investigation has revealed that Prince Te had been in close contact with the Japanese prior to the meeting. It is said that the Japanese have promised that if Prince Te requests autonomy from the Central Government, they will return the Chao Uda League, which is currently occupied by the Japanese army. However, Prince Te must set up the autonomous organization in Linsi. It is heard that the Japanese, in order to further incite them, plan to hold a meeting with the various princes in Dolon Nor on the 25th of this month. The situation in all of Mongolia is becoming increasingly serious, and the Central Government urgently needs to find a way to save the situation. (3rd Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanking) Minister of the Interior Huang Shao-hsiung stated that the situation in Mongolia is complex and incomparable to that of the inner provinces. The banner people are unfamiliar with the situation in Mongolia, have no opinions, and are unwilling to engage in empty talk. Everything will be handled by the government. My departure date for Mongolia has not yet been decided. (3rd Special Telegram)</p>

However, Mongolia has deep-seated religious, ethnic, and customary concepts, so implementation requires a comprehensive plan. The Executive Yuan meeting on the 3rd discussed this issue, but members felt that the content was too complex and required careful discussion with those familiar with the situation in Inner Mongolia before a direction could be decided. Minister Huang has obtained the consent of the Central Government. As for myself, due to the many tasks of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, it is undecided whether I can go.

<p>Huang Fu Arrives in Tsinan Yesterday</p>
<p>Meets Feng Yu-hsiang in Taian</p>
<p>Han Fu-chu Returns to Tsinan First to Greet Him</p>
<p>(Tsinan) Huang Fu arrived in Tai-an at 4:00 PM today. Feng sent Ma Po-yuan down the mountain to greet him at the station. At 6:00 PM, Huang and Ma rode mountain sedan chairs to Five Worthies Temple to visit Feng. Reporters accompanied them. Feng and Huang met, reminisced, and stayed for breakfast. At 9:00 AM, Huang went down the mountain first. Feng and the reporters walked to Pu-chao Temple, talking as they went. Feng said that he only reminisced with Huang, and has no views on the current situation. However, he sees that North China is very dangerous. The Japanese are taking an inch and wanting a mile, as the saying goes, "Good food is not left alone." If I leave the mountains, I will desperately kill the enemy. If I enter the mountains, I will diligently read and write. Chiang and Wang have not telegraphed recently, and I have no opinion on the other side's auspicious affairs. They took sedan chairs from Pu-chao Temple to the train station. Feng boarded Huang's train again and talked for half an hour. At 9:40, Feng said goodbye and got off the train. Huang is coming north, and Ma Po-yuan is traveling with him. Arriving in Tsinan at noon, Han and Shen Hung-lieh and Ko Kuang-ting all greeted him at the station. The station was full of welcoming slogans. After getting off the train, he went to the Provincial Government. Han hosted a banquet to welcome Huang. Huang said in the car that when he arrived in Peiping in May, his goal was to stabilize people's hearts. This time, it has been changed to boosting people's hearts. It is impossible to seek stability from stability, and it must be possible to seek stability from boosting spirits. The affairs of North China are big, one must have a majority of people to maintain it together, and the second must open up more economic livelihoods. There is no need to talk about diplomacy. In the past, one should blame oneself, and in the future, one should seek oneself. The security team's opening of Lo-tung's bandit suppression and negotiations after arriving in Peiping should not be a problem. (3rd Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tsinan) Han Fu-chu's special train returned to Tsinan at 1:30 AM on the 3rd. Sha Yueh-po, Chang Lien-sheng, and others returned together. Han talked about how the inspection trip was definitely more progressive than the previous one. Politics is best in Wendeng, and the judiciary is worst in all counties. Business is still good in Lungkou and Yantai. On the way, Han telegraphed Lin Chiang and Wang, reporting on the inspection and describing the public sentiment he had gathered. 1. Find ways to improve district and township chiefs; 2. Improve legal procedures. (3rd Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tsinan) Huang Fu said that North China is not completely stable at present. For this complex and difficult problem, one can only hope that the majority will work together unanimously. Relying on a few people alone is bound to fail at times. If North China wants to have a solution in the future, it must open up more economic livelihoods to avoid so many people squeezing on one road to compete for food, and to reduce war. If politics leaves the economy, it will never be done well. Improve and develop, and people are responsible for it. The press should advocate it, so that people's thoughts and work are concentrated on developing the economy to save China. The Tanggu Truce was endured with humiliation. Originally, it was thought that the Chinese people would learn from Goujian and endure hardship and plan revenge, but things have gone against our wishes, and there are still struggles for officialdom and profit. The Yi Jing says, "Heaven is strong, and gentlemen strengthen themselves unceasingly." We must never passively give up. I don't want to talk much about diplomacy. I advocate that in the past, one should blame oneself, and in the future, one should seek oneself. Internally, promote national unity, and externally, maintain a part of East Asia's peace. The Japanese army's obstruction of our bandit suppression can be resolved when I arrive in Peiping. The recovery of Yuguan still requires negotiation. Meeting with Han is because I am coming north, and I must talk to Han in detail about the Central Government's domestic and foreign policies. He is scheduled to meet Yu in Tientsin tonight. As for Sino-Japanese relations, I advocate that there is no need to pay too much attention to it, because people talk about right and wrong, and countries talk about interests. Also, after the provincial government banquet, the Japanese military attache in Tsinan, Hanatani, visited Huang and talked for a while. Before Huang boarded the train, he told reporters that he had a very pleasant conversation with Han. Han's governance of Lu, both military and political, has achieved good results. He has no special opinions on North China, and he adopts the principle of harmony and cooperation. The Japanese military attache's visit to me is a normal social courtesy and has no other meaning.

<p>He Ying-chin Telegraphs for Funding for North China's Military Expenses</p>
<p>(Nanking) He Ying-chin telegraphed Chairman Chiang and President Wang yesterday, reporting that the Ministry of Military Supplies' military expenses this year are enormous. Although the Ministry of Finance pays 18 million yuan per month, it is far from sufficient. Overall, as of the end of last month, military expenses were in arrears of about 22 million yuan. In addition, the severe winter is approaching, and soldiers of various armies and divisions urgently need to change into cotton uniforms, which require approximately 9 million yuan. At present, the total amount needed is approximately 30 million yuan. It is hoped that the Central Government will find a way to provide assistance before the official issuance of customs treasury bonds in order to overcome the difficulties. (3rd Special Telegram)</p>

<p>Chou Tso-min's Views on Economic Control</p>
<p>(Nanking) Chou Tso-min recently visited officials in Nanking to discuss methods for the revival of industry in North China after the war and to endorse economic control. He submitted recommendations to the Rural Revival Committee of the Executive Yuan and the National Economic Commission for reference, stating that the failure of North China's industry to thrive is due not only to the failure of banks to fulfill their responsibilities but also to various political, economic, and technical factors that make it difficult for banks to provide sufficient assistance. If the government has appropriate control over industry, and various industrial organizations have appropriate methods for self-control, then banks should also contribute. Two things should be prepared: (1) For various industries under direct and indirect state control, banks must have appropriate preparations to meet their capital needs. (2) Experts should be hired within the banking industry to set up a specialized department to conduct in-depth investigations of various industries to prepare for assisting the aforementioned control. (3) The banking industry should adapt to the needs of a controlled economy and carefully consider improving the two aspects of credit and financing in finance. If the above aspects can be prepared and implemented separately, then the future of North China's industry can be planned as a whole to promote development. (3rd Special Telegram)</p>
<p>Kwangtung Rice Merchants Request the Government to Postpone the Collection of Taxes on Foreign Rice</p>
<p>Please Also</p>
<p>Return the Wheat Tax to Rice Merchants for Collection and Payment</p>
<p>Advise Rice-Producing Areas to Cancel Local Rice Miscellaneous Taxes</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Kwangtung Rice Husk Merchants resolved on the 30th of last month: 1. Request the government to postpone the collection of foreign rice taxes by half a month; 2. Return the special tax to the rice husk merchants for collection and payment; 3. Please advise the governments of various rice-producing areas to cancel local rice export miscellaneous taxes. At the time, someone proposed suspending foreign rice and only dealing in local rice, but it was not put to a vote. The Political Research Association is scheduled to discuss the establishment of a trustee committee for taxes on imported agricultural products next week. (3rd Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Swatow) The special commissioner for the collection of taxes on imported agricultural products arrived in Swatow on the 1st and set up a bureau to collect rice taxes. The matters handled by the customs superintendent's office were transferred on the 2nd. (3rd Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Canton) According to the statistics recently released, the statement that adding taxes to imported rice and grains does not affect the standard of living has been proven. The rice merchants' claim that Kwangtung Province's rice and grain are only enough for 40% of Kwangtung's needs is completely inaccurate. In 1932, Kwangtung Province imported 13,576,542 piculs of rice and grain. The average person eats 4 piculs of rice per year, and the total population of Kwangtung Province is 30,000,000 people, so the total amount of rice eaten should be 120,000,000 piculs. Therefore, imported grain only accounts for 15%. Although the Kwangtung rice merchants strongly oppose the addition of taxes on foreign rice, the authorities have decided to implement it. In the past two weeks, a lot of foreign rice has been imported, and the Provincial Department of Finance has collected 100,000 yuan in taxes. Qu Fang-fu stated that the purpose of taxing foreign rice is to protect local agricultural products in order to prevent the dumping of foreign rice. Kwangtung Province imports about 100,000,000 yuan of foreign rice every year, which affects the financial foundation of South China, and the purchasing power of the people is also reduced. As for the tax increase, it will not lead to a shortage of rice because the authorities have purchased and transported it from Kwangsi and Hunan provinces. The rice merchants' reason for opposing is that increasing taxes will lose Kwangtung Province's rice and grain, and at the same time increase the burden on buyers. Because the southwestern provinces rely on foreign rice every year, people in Kwangtung will have to pay four yuan more in rice tax. Therefore, they ask the authorities to reconsider the tax issue, but the authorities have decided to maintain the original proposal. (3rd Reuters Telegram)</p>

In order to increase its value and sell it well in the world, a contract was signed with the British company Arnhold &amp; Co., but it is not an exclusive sale. Since the contract was signed, the value of each ton has risen from 450 yuan to 850 yuan, and even more than 900 yuan. The various sectors of Kiangsi did not understand the truth and opposed it.

<h3>Dispute over Burial Ground Leads to False Report of Murder</h3>
<p>Jing Zhongwu, a villager from Fengjia Village in the fourth district of this county, and his clansman Jing Liangbao had a dispute over a burial ground.

Not long after, they were carried back again. The illness suddenly worsened, and Liangbao died in Zhongwu's house. Yuchun then filed a complaint with the county government, claiming that his father had been pushed and killed.

Meanwhile, Examiner Xu, along with a coroner, went to open the coffin for examination. It was confirmed that Liangbao had died of illness. The two parties have now been brought together to clarify the matter and determine punishment.</p>

<p>China Aviation Corporation's Chongqing-Yunnan route, at six o'clock yesterday morning, the company's Aviation Group Director Brandt, along with Anley-sheng, departed for a test flight. The Shanghai-Guangdong route will be open for service in the middle of this month. The newly built airport in Chengdu has been completed, and the Chongqing-Chengdu section will be restored. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Test Flight on Chongqing-Yunnan Route</h3>

<h3>Cross-Border Road Construction and Telephone Issues</h3>
<h3>Long-Term Contract Discussed Yesterday</h3>
<p>The cross-border road construction and telephone issue in this city, since the Ministry of Communications, together with the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Shanghai Concession Telephone Company, signed a temporary contract, is now under orders to continue with a long-term contract. Director of the Public Works Bureau Xu Peihuang and Director of the Telephone Bureau Xu Xueyu have actively researched this issue several times. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, a formal meeting was held at the Telephone Bureau for detailed discussions. Furthermore, the establishment of telephone branch bureaus in Pudong and the city center has been approved by the Ministry of Communications. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Meeting Between Two Bureaus on Cross-Border Telephone Issues:</h3>
<p>At 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, the Ministry of Communications, together with representatives from the Municipal Public Works Bureau and the Telephone Bureau, held a meeting at the Ministry of Communications Telephone Bureau to discuss the issue. Those present included Counselor of the Ministry of Communications Gu Deming, Director of the Telephone Bureau Xu Xueyu, Chief of the Third Section of the Public Works Bureau Zheng Baocheng, and Chief Engineer of the Telephone Bureau Yu Bingjian. The discussion lasted for two hours. Based on the contract, a detailed discussion was held. However, the content was not made public because it had not reached the stage of release. It is understood that the long-term contract must be formally negotiated with the Concession Telephone Company within the term of the temporary contract. Therefore, after further research by the two bureaus on the issue of sovereignty, a meeting with the Telephone Company will be convened and discussed in the near future.</p>
<h3>Branch Bureau Plan Approved Regarding the Ministry of Communications Telephone Bureau, the plan to establish branch bureaus in the Pudong city center area has been approved by the Ministry of Communications.</h3>
<p>Requests for installation and removal of telephones in cross-border sections have also been completed. Requests for removal and reinstallation have continued to arrive.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Guangdong Line Opening Date</h3>
<p>The company's Shanghai-Guangdong route had already been successfully tested. However, due to various unresolved issues, the opening has been delayed. Recently, the southwestern authorities are promoting the aviation industry. There was once a rumor that the line would be suspended, but the company declared it to be inaccurate. It is learned that all issues hindering the opening of the line have been completely resolved. The date of the official opening will be determined within days, and it is expected to be realized in the middle of this month. All facilities along the line, such as Shanghai, Wenzhou, Xiamen, Hong Kong, and Guangzhou, have been properly arranged. It is also heard that when the official opening occurs, large Sikorsky aircraft will be used, allowing travel from Shanghai to Guangdong to be completed in one day. All the stations along the route are major trading ports, and it is expected that the business will flourish after the opening of the line.</p>
<h3>Chongqing-Chengdu Section to Be Restored</h3>
<p>The company's Hankou-Chongqing line Chongqing-Chengdu section was opened several months ago. However, due to the small size of the Chengdu airport and its unsuitability, and the inconvenience of the airport's distance from the city, which made it difficult to pick up and deliver mail and passengers, it was soon suspended. A vacant lot in the city was surveyed to open a new airport. Construction has been underway for several months, and now all the work has been completed. The company's pilot, Anley-sheng, flew there last week to inspect and was quite satisfied. Therefore, the Chongqing-Chengdu section of the airline is expected to be opened this month.</p>
<p>However, the telephone exchange of the Telephone Bureau is still insufficient. Therefore, for cross-border telephones that have not been removed, they will be removed in order. According to the Chief Engineer of the Telephone Bureau, Yu Bingjian, the exchange for the Pudong Branch Bureau is an eight-hundred-line exchange, but it is old and needs to be repaired before it can be used. The original three-hundred-line automatic exchange in Pudong will be removed because most telephone calls in that area are connected to the concession and need to be manually transferred. The exchange brought from the Ministry will be installed. The automatic exchange in Pudong will be installed in the city center. The installation and removal work of the Pudong Branch Bureau is expected to be completed in early November. As for the Longhua Branch Bureau, the Telephone Bureau plans to install an automatic exchange, with a budget of approximately 50,000 yuan. Once approved by the Ministry, work can begin. The Telephone Bureau is adding fifty pairs of trunk lines to the switchboard due to the lack of lines, bringing the total to one hundred pairs, at a cost of approximately 100,000 yuan. After this project is completed, cross-border telephones can be completely removed.</p>

<h3>Factory Inspection Negotiations Suspended</h3>
<p>The Result of Fei Xindun and Yu Hongjun's Meeting and Discussion Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>Cross-Border Road Construction Cannot Be Discussed Under These Circumstances</p>
<p>The factory inspection issue in the Public Concession, after several consultations between the Secretary-General of the Municipal Government and the Director-General of the Public Works Department, Fei Xindun, showed some signs of progress. However, because the Board of Directors of the Public Works Department insisted on jurisdiction, the future of the negotiations became bleak again. Yesterday afternoon, Fei Xindun again met with Secretary-General of the Municipal Government Yu Hongjun to discuss the factory inspection issue in the Public Concession. Secretary-General Yu stated that because the Board of Directors of the Public Works Department insisted on maintaining jurisdiction over factory inspections within the concession, the Chinese authorities were unwilling to continue discussing the establishment of a factory inspection office within the concession. Under these circumstances, discussions on the issue of cross-border road construction could not be raised. When the Board of Directors of the Public Works Department held a meeting yesterday afternoon, Director-General Fei Xindun made a special report. As a result, negotiations on both the factory inspection and cross-border road construction issues were suspended.</p>
<h3>Sino-British Telecommunications Transmitter Shipped to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Has Been Shipped to Zhenru Radio Station for Installation</p>
<p>Formal Telecommunications Can Begin by the End of This Year</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications International Telecommunications Bureau, in order to prepare for Sino-British telecommunications, is building a new transmitter station at the Zhenru International Radio Station and has ordered two transmitters and four receivers from Marconi Company in the United Kingdom. The four receivers have been shipped to Shanghai and installed. One transmitter was shipped from the UK the other day and was transported to Zhenru for installation yesterday. Another transmitter is in transit and will arrive soon. Sino-British telecommunications are scheduled to be realized by the end of the year. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>New Station Completed</h3>
<p>The International Telecommunications Bureau, because the existing radio station was insufficient for Sino-British telecommunications, built a new transmitter station next to the Zhenru International Radio Station. The project was contracted by Xinyingji Construction Company. Construction began in April, and the entire project was completed in July. The new station building was designed and patterned by experts according to the size of various components, so the internal engineering is very solid and durable.</p>
<h3>Transmitter Arrived</h3>
<p>The antenna tower components, large receivers, and two twenty-kilowatt transmitters with a telephone, ordered by the bureau from Marconi Company in the United Kingdom, have been shipped to Shanghai one after another. The antenna towers, three in Zhenru and five in Liuhe, have all been installed. The four receivers were shipped to Shanghai and then transported to Liuhe for installation, which has now been completed. Two receivers are still being shipped, one of which arrived a week ago and was stored at the McKenna Road Radio Station. It was transported to Zhenru for installation yesterday. Another is being shipped from the UK and will arrive in Shanghai soon for installation.</p>
<h3>Planning to Install Underground Cables</h3>
<p>According to the person in charge of the station, the Zhenru Radio Station and the wireless radio station in the Sassoon Building on Nanjing Road in the city have telephone antennas installed along the way. It is feared that these antennas will be affected in the event of storms or other unexpected events, which would interrupt communications. For the sake of thoroughness, it is planned to bury underground cables along the way from Zhenru to the Sassoon Building on Nanjing Road. The project will cost approximately one million yuan. The underground cables have been ordered from the UK and have been shipped to Shanghai. Bids are being invited from contractors. Installation will begin soon. The section from Zhenru to McKenna Road is within Chinese territory, so the installation of the cables can proceed without obstacles. However, the section from McKenna Road to Nanjing Road is within the concession, so the existing underground cables will be leased from the concession for use due to various reasons. This matter should not be a problem.</p>
<h3>Adding Generators for Backup</h3>
<p>All equipment at the radio station relies on electricity to operate. The electricity is supplied by the Zhabei Water and Electricity Plant, and the monthly electricity consumption is quite large. The station has purchased a generator from the Nanjing Ministry of Communications Construction Committee. A building is being added in Zhenru to house the generator, which is scheduled to be completed in the shortest possible time. In the future, part of the station's electricity needs will be supplied by this generator. The reason for installing the generator is to save expenses, but the main reason is to prepare for emergencies in case the water and electricity company has an accident or stops supplying electricity.</p>
<h3>Sino-British Telecommunications at the End of the Year</h3>
<p>As for the date of Sino-British telecommunications, according to the station, the four receivers have been installed one after another, but one of the two transmitters has now arrived, and the other will arrive soon. All installation work will take about a month to complete. The procedures for connection and test reporting are quite cumbersome, so Sino-British telecommunications will not be realized until the end of the year at the earliest.</p>
<h3>Anti-War Conference Delegates to Leave Shanghai Today</h3>
<p>Continental News reported that the anti-war conference delegates will leave Shanghai tomorrow (the 4th) on a Norwegian freighter for Vladivostok, where they will transfer to the Siberian Railway to return home.

<h3>Electricity Company Workers Continued Their Work Slowdown Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Situation Is Becoming More Dangerous</p>
<p>Da Gong News reported that more than two thousand workers in the new and old factories of the Shanghai Electric Power Company staged a general slowdown due to opposition to the company's dismissal of workers and deduction of pension funds. The slowdown continued yesterday. Party and government agencies sent personnel to mediate, but to no avail. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Refusal to Collect Wages After the general slowdown by all workers in the new and old factories, the Director-General of the Public Works Department, Zhong Si, consulted with the company authorities, but there were no results. The company's attitude remained firm. Yesterday morning, the company posted a notice in English at the factory gate urging workers to collect their wages. However, until 5:30 PM, no one went to collect them. The notice stated: All workers in the new factory who have left their positions can collect their wages at the New Factory brand name office on Dongting Road, Yangshupu, on October 3 (Tuesday). Deputy Director-General and General Manager Xue Erde, October 3, 1933.</h3>
<h3>The Workers' Side Petitioned the Municipal Government After the Fourth District Water and Electricity Workers' Union representatives to the Municipal Government to petition, they again sent representatives Ni Wenfu, Zhu Haosheng, Chen Youfa, Pan Genlin, Chen Miaosheng, Hu Yousheng, and six others to the Municipal Government yesterday morning to petition for assistance and to urge the factory to issue pension funds. They were received by Zhang Yiyu, a staff member of the First Section, who inquired about the past methods and the slowdown situation, and promised to transfer the matter to the Social Bureau for mediation as soon as possible, and advised the workers to wait quietly for a solution and not to cause further disputes. The representatives were satisfied and returned.</h3>
<h3>Party and Government Mediation Ineffective After receiving a report from the Fourth District Water and Electricity Workers' Union, the Municipal Party Department and the Planning Committee sent personnel to investigate the other day. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, the Municipal Party Department sent Dai Youheng and the Social Bureau sent Zhu Jintao to the Jiazi office of the Electric Power Company on Jiangxi Road to meet with Deputy Director-General and General Manager Xue Erde to conduct mediation. As a result, the factory side believed that the workers' side had no reason to cause the labor unrest and expressed that it was difficult to accept the demands made by the workers' side. Later, only the pension fund issue was discussed, but there were no results and the meeting ended.</h3>
<h3>The Workers' Side Took Care of Fire Control After the workers in the new and old factories of the Shanghai Electric Power Company implemented the general slowdown, the three shifts of workers continued to maintain power generation as usual and were not affected. However, if the labor unrest is not resolved, it will inevitably affect the three shifts of workers. Although more than fifty White Russians have been hired, they are not as experienced as Chinese workers and are not sufficient to distribute. Usually, if a fire occurs in the company, the company must send Chinese workers to cut the power lines. Now that the Chinese workers have also joined the slowdown, the company is deeply afraid that if a fire occurs, it will be difficult to deal with it. Therefore, yesterday the company sent personnel to contact the workers' side and requested that the power-cutting workers return to work first. The workers' side, for the sake of local security, has also agreed to the request.</h3>
<h3>Refuting the Company's Statement The Fourth District Water and Electricity Workers' Union refuted the company's statement yesterday, stating that since the appointment of President Hopkins, the Shanghai Electric Power Company has successively dismissed workers, reaching more than six hundred people. All the workers in the job are panicked and organized a labor union to seek a unified unity in order to resist. However, the company still does not care and intensifies its oppression, and also swallows the pension funds of two people. The dispute has accumulated and has not been resolved. In the middle, the workers directly requested the company authorities many times without success. The party affairs organs also sent personnel to mediate several times, and the company also did not accept it. Mr. Yuan Ludeng Yu Qiaqing Xu Xinliu and Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Wang Xiaolai also paid a sincere mediation, but there was no result. This time, when the pending case has not been resolved, the new factory dismissed three workers again on the grounds. The six leaders consulted with the factory fear Elmer and were rejected. The workers could not bear it, so they had to declare a slowdown. The company said that it had not received any requests from the workers' side before, which is completely a cover-up. The special refutation is as above. Fortunately, all circles appreciate it.</h3>

<h3>Establishment of September 18th Memorials in Various Places</h3>
<p>Suggestions from All Circles in the Capital</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce received a telegram from the Nanjing Capital All Circles Commemoration of the Second Anniversary of September 18th Conference yesterday, (title omitted). Since the Shenyang Incident, the four northeastern provinces have successively fallen. Old hatred has not been avenged, and new shame has been added frequently. All of our countrymen are indignant and vow to perish with the violent Japanese. However, our national strength is insufficient to resist the invaders. To preserve our determination to avenge our shame, the key lies in self-strengthening. In the past, Fuchai did not forget the revenge of Huili and eventually avenged Yue. Goujian did not forget the shame of Kuaiji and finally was able to defeat Wu. In view of this, the Chamber of Commerce has resolved to telegraph various local party headquarters and mass organizations to establish [Do Not Forget the National Humiliation of September 18th Memorials] in their respective locations to commemorate the national humiliation. It is desired to establish the spirit of the tree and perpetuate it, so that the public will be aware and know where to be vigilant. We hope to receive your approval and jointly promote it, so that the people will know the spirit of courage and courage, and the national revival will have a chance. The lost land has not been restored, and the pain is endless. Special telegrams are sent to you for your consideration. The Capital All Circles Commemoration of the Second Anniversary of September 18th Conference bows,</p>
<h3>Disaster Reports from Various Parties</h3>
<p>Yinxian The entire membership of the Eighth District Administrative Council sent a fast mail telegram to the Ningbo Fellow Association, Ningbo Fellow Association, This month on the 18th and 19th, a hurricane passed through, with strong winds and heavy rain, lasting day and night without ceasing, urban traffic was cut off, houses collapsed and walls collapsed, everywhere, rural mountain floods broke out, and the river water rose by more than ten feet, fields and houses were flooded, people and livestock were killed and injured, roads, bridges, dams, and weirs, many were washed away, now the accumulated water has not receded, and the autumn harvest is hopeless. This year's disaster has become a reality. At this time of rural bankruptcy, it is even more unbearable. All members of this conference, witnessing this, feel heartbroken, and all think that raising money is urgent. Although a Yinxian Flood Relief Committee has recently been organized, it is feared that the scope of effort will be limited. We have always admired your association's concern for our hometown and hope that you will raise your voice and quickly raise relief funds to provide assistance. We are very much looking forward to it. The entire membership of the Eighth Yinxian Administrative Council, Mou Xiaotian, Chen Binlin, Yu Jimin, Zhao Zhishi, and fifty-one others, bow, survey,</p>
<p>Huaxian The magistrate of Huaxian, Henan, Xie Suian, sent a telegram, (title omitted). All newspapers, Haotian has no sorrow, and the people are in deep trouble. Our Hua is the most unfortunate. Since August 3, the neighboring dike collapsed, and the Yellow River water flowed horizontally. More than 600 villages were flooded, and more than 5,000 square miles became a swamp. The crops sank, and the houses drifted. Thirty million obedient people, accounting for half of the population of Huaxian, suffered this unprecedented catastrophe within a few days. After repeated telegrams, we have already received insight. Now, we will briefly state the disaster relief process and recent disaster situation for more than a month. Fortunately, when the Yellow River disaster first came, Suian flew to the top of the peak, divided the telegrams to good groups to request rescue, and summoned the local elders to recommend public gentlemen to organize a water disaster relief society to be responsible for raising funds to save the ungrateful. We relied on our provincial government, the provincial relief council, the Red Swastika Society of Beiping, the Nanjing Supervisory Yuan, and the Central Yellow River Water Disaster Relief Society, which were all concerned and sent successors to the county to investigate and release emergency relief. Our neighboring officials, gentlemen, and local philanthropists also donated money and food, and changed boats to rescue the masses. By September 18, we received a total of 18,000 yuan in relief funds, including 6,500 yuan from the provincial government in two installments, 1,400 yuan from the provincial relief council, nearly 5,000 yuan from the Red Swastika Society in two installments, 1,000 yuan from Mr. Lin Boqiao of the First Prison in Guangdong, and about 4,000 yuan from local philanthropists and various agencies. In addition, 3,000 stones of warehouse grains from each district that were not affected by the water disaster and those that were less affected were required to be paid to the district within a limited time to replenish the district warehouses to provide relief to the 36 disaster-stricken shelters that have been established. The local financial resources have been exhausted. The total value of money and grain from all parties is more than 48,000 yuan. If one person can become rich, it can only be given to 300,000 disaster victims for up to 3 days of thin porridge. The number of disaster victims in our Hua is more than twice the number of 144,225 disaster victims in the four counties of Luxi recorded in the Ta Kung Pao on September 18. In addition, the autumn wind has been rustling and the autumn rain has been drizzling for days. People who are well-fed and well-clad will hear the sound and feel sad. If our disaster victims who are hungry and cold do not have a large amount of relief funds and relief clothing, how will they survive? Suian witnessed the robbery and felt very distressed. If he does not seek help and relief, the strong and cunning people will inevitably take risks, and the old and weak will fill the trenches. Thinking about the future is even more frightening. Suian dare not bear the entrustment of the party and the country, and let the local worries be put down. Therefore, he is not afraid to bother and respectfully appeals for clothes and food to feed the disaster victims of Ziyi. He is not victorious and waiting for orders. Xie Suian, the magistrate of Huaxian, Henan, bow.</p>
<p>Heze The Chinese Jisheng Association and various good groups jointly established the Luxi Yellow River breach, Heze County, a terrible disaster. I just received a telegram from Li Jun Yunmendong, the director of relief affairs, Yundeng arrived at Heze late at night and stayed at the Education Museum. The disaster situation in this area is indeed very serious. It is estimated that more than 300,000 people in the county were flooded. The areas most affected are the 450 villages in Tonghe Township, etc. There are more than 114,000 people in extreme poverty. We will go to the countryside for inspection tomorrow and report in detail. Please, gentlemen, do your best to raise relief funds to comfort the disaster victims. Li Changlong's telegram said that the disaster situation is so serious. How should we help the disaster victims? The association has copied and telegraphed various good groups to jointly plan and coordinate to raise funds. We rely on compassionate comrades at home and abroad to cultivate more blessings and save the dying compatriots.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Railways Replies to Municipal Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>Intermodal Transport Temporarily Handled by China Merchants Bureau on a Trial Basis</p>
<p>Privately Operated Shipping Companies to Be Postponed</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce previously sent a letter to the Ministry of Railways at the request of the Shipping Association, requesting that intermodal transport affairs not be limited to the state-owned China Merchants Bureau in order to maintain privately operated shipping companies. The Ministry of Railways replied to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday in the following original text. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce has read the cold telegram. The intermodal transport measures agreed upon by the state-owned railway and the state-owned China Merchants Bureau at this intermodal transport conference are based on the intermodal transport outline agreed upon by both parties in 1931. The outline stipulates that China Merchants Bureau has priority in signing contracts for intermodal transport with various railways, which is inconvenient to overturn the previous agreement. Therefore, we have to proceed with it first. Moreover, the facts are newly created and the clues are complicated. The number of intermodal transport passengers and goods is difficult to estimate for a while. It is not appropriate to rashly join the company because the shipping company is not able to add ships, wharves, and warehouses. After the trial operation with China Merchants Bureau is successful, each privately operated shipping company can consider the intermodal transport situation and prepare for the operation. This is exactly the hard work of the Ministry to protect privately operated shipping companies. It is definitely not something that can be boasted about in the meantime. According to the previous situation, it is specially replied for your information. Ministry of Railways Yinyin</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Added Appointed Land Tax Valuation Committee Members</h3>
<p>Lin Kanghou Yao Xin Zhi</p>
<p>After the central government approved the various collection rules for the temporary land price tax collection in this city, the municipal government actively prepared for the collection. In addition to appointing Wang Xiaolai, Guo Shun, Zhang Xiaoliang, Gui Yanfang Hongkui, Chen Jun, Yang Nianzu, Wu Hengru, Xue Cixin, and other nine people as valuation committee members, Lin Kanghou Yao Xin Zhi were added as valuation committee members.</p>
<h3>Fifth National Domestic Goods Movement Conference</h3>
<p>The Purpose is to Promote Domestic Goods That Replace Foreign Goods</p>
<p>Opening on Double Ten Festival Exhibition Period of Approximately One Week</p>
<p>The Fifth National Domestic Goods Movement Exhibition Conference, hosted by the Municipal Social Bureau of this city, will be held at the Municipal Mass Education Hall on Double Ten Festival. The nature of this exhibition movement is slightly different from the recent domestic goods exhibitions held in various places in this city. It focuses on items that can resist foreign goods. Items that can replace foreign goods are marked and compared one by one so that the people can remove them and take them. Therefore, special attention is paid to the quality and price. As for the exhibits of each industry, they will be classified and displayed in the museum at the same time. Please invite various experts to evaluate them. They are purely for research and observation. There is absolutely no business promotion. The exhibition date is determined to start on October 10 for one week. It will be closed on the 17th. It is heard that the consignments from various industries have been contacted and arranged. Only the opening ceremony will be held because the lecture hall of the museum is too small. It will be held at the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce at Tianhou Palace Bridge on the afternoon of the 10th.</p>
<h3>Domestic Goods Exhibition Added More Spaces</h3>
<p>So That All Manufacturers Can Participate as Much as Possible</p>
<p>The Domestic Goods Movement Exhibition Conference has been open for two weeks. The association originally planned to exhibit for three weeks, and the closing date is the 5th of this month. Now, it has received letters from all walks of life requesting an extension of the closing date. After the fourth representatives meeting, it was resolved to extend the closing date for ten days and set it for October 15. It is heard that Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo will come to Shanghai in person to participate in the closing ceremony. The other news is divided as follows.</p>
<h3>Convene Review Meeting</h3>
<p>The association is scheduled to convene a review meeting at 10:00 AM tomorrow (the 5th). A letter has been sent to each review committee member, Dear, We are scheduled to convene the third review meeting at 10:00 AM on the morning of the 5th of this month to review the products of various factories in order to classify them and award prizes. It is a matter of encouraging production. It is hoped that you will be on time for the prayer.</p>
<h3>Soliciting Products</h3>
<p>The association is scheduled to solicit products from each factory from 10:00 AM today (the 4th). The association will also develop a review form for each factory to fill in in detail so that it can be collected and reviewed. It is heard that the items collected today are electrical appliances, cotton and woolen knitwear, daily necessities, leather goods, thermos bottles, medical and chemical products, education toys, and works of art. There are no less than thousands of items.</p>
<h3>Today's Amusement</h3>
<p>Today is the abandoned lunar Mid-Autumn Festival, and there will be more guests visiting the meeting than usual. In addition to ordering each factory to distribute samples, the amusement park also added more seats and invited Zhou Han, Lu Lajuan, Sun Yin Feng, Liu Chunfan, etc. to perform dramas. Amusement coupons will be distributed by each manufacturer to the guests. It is heard that you can get one coupon for every dollar you spend on goods.</p>
<h3>Added More Spaces</h3>
<p>After the registration deadline, many manufacturers requested to join the association. At that time, the number was full and it was not convenient to expand. Now, the exhibition period has been extended for ten days from the 6th of this month, and the manufacturers have once again seized the opportunity to request to join the association. It has been decided yesterday to add more than twenty spaces to meet the needs of various manufacturers to join the exhibition and avoid the regret of Xiang Yu.</p>
<h3>Ikuma Maru Brought a Large Number of Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>More than 800 Tons of Sugar and Sundries</p>
<p>The atmosphere of goods arriving from various places is gradually becoming plain, so the import of Japanese goods is also gradually increasing. The Yangtze River area has returned to its pre-war state. Yesterday, when the Japanese wheel Ikuma Maru arrived in Shanghai, a large number of Japanese goods were unloaded, estimated to be more than 800 tons of sugar and sundries transported from Kobe. It is heard that a large number of Japanese goods will also be imported and distributed to various places.</p>
<h3>Native Cloth Movement Telegraphs</h3>
<p>Issue Orders to All Agencies to Use Native Cloth</p>
<p>In order to promote the use of native cloth by urban people and increase the production of farmers' side business, the Shanghai County Farmers' Education Center jointly organized the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, the Social Bureau, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Municipal Farmers' Association, and the Taijiabao Three Counties Native Cloth Improvement Association to hold the Native Cloth Movement Conference at the Municipal Mass Education Hall on the 16th of last month. The conference has ended. Yesterday, it sent a special telegram to the Ministry of Interior, ordering all agencies to use native cloth and allocate funds for improvement to promote it. The telegram said (omitted above) that the association is aware that the rural economy has declined to the extreme. The increase in imports of foreign cloth has greatly affected the original side business of farmers. It was jointly organized by the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau, the Municipal Education Bureau, the Municipal Farmers' Association, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the County Education Bureau, the County Farmers' Education Center, the Chinese Cloth Association, and the Taijiabao Native Cloth Improvement Association to hold the opening ceremony on September 16 to exhibit various native cloths and manufactured clothing. We asked celebrities and scholars to broadcast speeches and shout loudly to awaken the people and awaken the country. After half a month, tens of thousands of viewers came. The effect of the propaganda is expected to be that the livelihood of farmers will be in imminent danger in</p>
<h3>Yushan Chestnuts</h3>
<p>— Yu Youqing</p>
<p>I have been a guest in Wuxia for three autumns. Yesterday, a friend from my hometown came and gave me a bag of fresh chestnuts. This is a specialty of my hometown. It was like meeting an old friend from thousands of miles away, I was so happy, because I haven't eaten chestnuts from my hometown for many years.</p>
<p>The fresh, hairy chestnuts from Yushan in my hometown are called "Musk Sachet." How fragrant and beautiful this name is! Just seeing this name makes people think of the sweet and tender taste of musk. It is truly worthy of a literary phrase, "different from ordinary products."</p>
<p>The Osmanthus Chestnuts from the Xingfu area around Hanbei Gate, when peeled and eaten, have a hint of osmanthus fragrance. Even when they are boiled, the flavor doesn't change. Compared to the Musk Sachet, the name has a special charm.</p>
<p>In the cool autumn weather, Wang Si's wine shop in Xingfu opens on time. Besides oily chicken, fresh chestnut stir-fried chicken is the best dish. It really fits the saying, "I wouldn't let go even if you slapped me."</p>
<p>Fresh chestnut soup, also known as chestnut cream, is indeed a precious drink for sobering up. Pick fresh chestnuts from the chestnut tree, peel off the outer husk, and then put the fresh chestnuts in hot water and simmer them over low heat. A spoonful of sweet soup and fresh chestnuts sent to the mouth will definitely give you a different and flavorful feeling.</p>
<p>Chestnuts are also named after people, the most famous being "Sweet Wine Second." His chestnuts are not valued for their size, but for being small and round. First, the chestnuts are soaked in water, then taken out and air-dried. Then, small holes are poked in the chestnuts with a small needle and stir-fried in sand. When the chestnuts are half-cooked, sugar syrup is added to the sand. When the chestnuts are cooked, the sugar syrup is all inside them, not in the sand. Therefore, his chestnuts are more expensive and tastier than others' because he adds a bit of sweet wine. So, people call him "Sweet Wine Second."</p>
<p>If you don't believe that the chestnuts from my hometown are good, then let me introduce something to you, and you will know that my words are not false. This is a passage from "Louzhu's Yushan Chestnut Delights," which was published in the "Free Talk" edited by Shou Juan in the 18th year of the Republic of China...</p>
<p>丨Then came a bowl of fresh chestnut cream, truly resembling golden syrup, praising white jade, and adding tin sugar, sweet, tender, fragrant, and with a unique wild taste. 君 said that the chestnuts produced in Beishan are better than those in Xishan, especially those that are short, small, and firm, are even more fresh and tender. The chestnuts used for making cream must be picked from the tree tops. If they are left overnight or sold in the city, the delicious flavor will be completely lost.</p>
<p>From this passage, you can know the fame of the chestnuts from my hometown. But as a guest in a foreign land, when the autumn wind rises, I think of the fresh chestnuts from my hometown, just like Zhang Zhihe's love for water shield soup and sea bass. Especially after reading this passage from "Louzhu's Yushan Chestnut Delights," it makes me even more homesick. There are many lovely things in my hometown, especially the fresh chestnuts from the Xingfu area, which make me miss them as if I were thinking of someone thousands of miles away.</p>

The News Daily opened a room in the Central Hotel next to the allocation office, waiting for news and copying it from the side. At that time, the person in charge was out on official business, and the staff in the office did not realize the importance of this task and did not stop it. In addition to a warning from Chief Secretary Zhang to the staff member, all future news will be released by the publicity team. Furthermore, the order of the Games has not yet been approved by the Standing Committee and is still subject to many changes.

He bears the responsibility for the publicity of the Games and regrets that he could not prevent it in advance. He has requested the organizing committee to take appropriate disciplinary action.

<p>Mr. Xu Xinji Is Scheduled to Arrive in Shanghai on the 8th of This Month</p>
<p>Twice Defeated Qiu Feihai in Early Summer Last Year</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese tennis players Xu Xinji and Lin Xuyin have registered to participate in the Double Ten Festival Nanjing National Games. The two gentlemen's skills are well-known overseas. Mr. Lin is only second to Lin Wangsu. Mr. Xu defeated Qiu Feihai twice in early summer last year. This time, they returned to the country together to attend the National Games, which is very noteworthy. The disadvantage is that this year's competition is only divided into two groups for singles and one group for doubles. Singles players cannot also play doubles, so Mr. Xu and Mr. Lin cannot compete in doubles. This group is bound to be sent away. If Xu and Lin cannot win two each. Batavia tennis master Xu Xinji</p>
<p>Xu Xinji and Qiu Feihai take a photo</p>
<p>Singles, there is still no hope of winning the championship. Lin Baohua and Qian Huibin, representing Sichuan, are also in the same situation. Therefore, the highest hope for the championship is still in Shanghai. However, the return of Xu and Lin to compete will arouse the attention of tennis players across the country. A grand gathering of domestic and foreign stars is a very interesting thing. It is a pity that Lin Wangsu cannot return to the country, which is still a shortcoming. It is learned that Xu and Lin will return to the country on the Chini Gala. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 8th.</p>
<p>The Propaganda Team Proposed That</p>

It was decided to bury it as appropriate by the propaganda team. (10) (6) The publicity team proposed that there were difficulties in printing the order and how to remedy it. It was decided to pass it according to the opinions put forward by the publicity team. (10) (7) The reception team of the committee proposed that the group's reception staff was still not enough to allocate. It is proposed to hire Zhang Guanchun and Yu Xiansi as honorary directors of the group, and Wang Zhaohuai, Huang Rinquan, and Zhong Naili as honorary receptionists of the group.

(2) (10) (1) The reception team proposed that the contract passed by the General Assembly between the group's catering department and the contractor Han Wansong stipulates that the committee provides the contractor with a truck, gasoline and driver.

(2) (10) (2) The reception team proposed that the public buses and trucks provided by the General Assembly for the group to pick up and drop off have been carefully planned and calculated to the lowest extent. The traffic group has been requested to allocate the number as scheduled.

From October 10th to the closing, eight public buses and one truck will be used every day. After the closing, 16 public buses and 10 trucks will be used every day for three days. If necessary, you can still request additional additions at any time. The decision was passed. (2) (10) (3) The reception team proposed that there is an original road from the venue to the cafeteria, but at the same time, more than 2,000 people eat there, and there is only one road to walk on, which is not enough. Therefore, it is proposed to rush to build two simple coal cinder roads to avoid congestion and accidents. As for the original road, which has not been renovated, it is also proposed to add coal cinder. Kang Xuhang, Cheng Wuwenhua, Tao Tianxing, Lou Tongsun, Zheng Chuanlin, and Chen Feng are honorary directors of the traffic group, and Tong Huaxuan, Gong Yi, and Hu Gongzhang are assistant directors.

<p>A Summary of the Preparations of the Reception Group of the National Games</p>
<p>The matters handled by the group are divided into reception, catering, accommodation, entertainment, and special reception, with thousands of threads and heavy responsibilities. It has been a month since the preparations began. In this month, first draft a work plan, and then review and approve it. Then, follow the plan and proceed separately. Up to today, it can be regarded as the end of a section. After the preparations are completed, the work will begin during the Games, and it will be even more complicated. I am afraid that the planning will not be perfect and one will be missed. However, Renlin will supervise and lead the colleagues of the group, wait with an open mind, and carefully do things, so as to live up to the heavy trust of the General Assembly and achieve a satisfactory result. I hope that the members of the General Assembly will provide encouragement from time to time based on what they have seen and heard. (Huang Renlin)</p>

<h3>A Robbery Occurred in Wanshou Township</h3>
<p>Wang Jinwen, a farmer from the fifth district, Wanshou Township, under the county’s jurisdiction, was known for his wealth, leading to him being coveted by bandits. Yesterday at 8 PM, more than ten bandits armed with Mauser pistols stormed and destroyed his front gate, barged in, seized Wang's younger brother and son, and tortured them for money. Besides seizing two self-defense guns, silver coins, and jewelry, they also kidnapped Wang's three-year-old grandson, Gangjiezi. By the time the neighbors heard the alarm and rushed to help, it was too late.</p>

<h3>Fireworks Explosion Severely Injures Several</h3>
<p>At 9 PM yesterday (the 1st), a sudden gunpowder explosion occurred at the Wu Longxing fireworks store located at Xiaojiaochangkou on the West Avenue of Yongbu, shaking the entire city. At the time of the explosion, the entire store building and two small residential houses belonging to the store were instantly engulfed in flames. Store employees Shen Linfu, Yu Quanxing, Ye Chunyuan, and the cook, an old woman named Chen Dai's, were unable to escape in time and were severely injured by the explosion. After the fire broke out, fire brigades from the city and suburbs, as well as the YMCA rescue team, quickly gathered to extinguish the flames. Dai Shengfu, the four-year-old son of the Wu Longxing store owner, was buried in a pile of rubble and rescued by the YMCA rescue team, fortunately still alive. Fang Linyuan, Chen Qihe, and others, employees of the Longyu Soy Sauce shop, were also rescued by the rescue team. In addition to Wu Longxing, the shops burned in this incident included Wang Yongxing's food shop, Longyu Soy Sauce Shop, and Shi Hengli Inn, resulting in the destruction of more than ten buildings and considerable losses.</p>

<h3>Once Shone Upon the General's Mansion</h3>
<p>— Yan Qiao</p>
<p>Although forced adaptation of Tang poetry is sentimental, it has a unique flavor: [Now only the Liaoyang moon remains, once shone upon the general's mansion.] This evening, in this ancient city, should the Young Marshal have a bit of poetic inspiration, this would be his sentiment.</p>
<p>Outside the Pass, during the Mid-Autumn Festival, are there also customs like moon worship or moon gazing? I don't know. But within the Pass, these customs originally existed. This year, there probably won't be much enthusiasm. The rural areas are so empty and impoverished that people can't even afford incense burners. The petty bourgeoisie, enduring the pain, will buy some fruits, flowers, and incense to mark the occasion, but they can only stare blankly at the moon with worried faces. Only a small number of wealthy families will continue to enjoy themselves. I've seen that in several tea and snack shops in Suzhou, the dwindling of mooncakes and the increasingly luxurious incense burners in incense shops suggest the situation described above.</p>
<p>Originally, there's no need to worship the Mid-Autumn moon. According to Yue Ke of the Song Dynasty in his "Kuitan Record," moon gazing during the Mid-Autumn Festival only started after the Kaiyuan era of the Tang Dynasty. Before that, Emperor Yuan of Liang watching the moon on the river, Zhu Chao watching the moon on a boat, and Emperor Taizong of Tang watching the moon in Liaocheng were not during Mid-Autumn Festival. Probably because "Classified Records of Matters" says that Emperor Ming of Tang toured the Moon Palace with the Taoist Hongdu on a Mid-Autumn night and listened to the "Rainbow Skirt Feather Coat Dance," common people also hoped to follow suit. They respectfully offered things during the Mid-Autumn Festival, hoping the moon would see their sincerity, hoping the young girls spinning silk would receive a golden shuttle – pure gold at one hundred fourteen yuan per tael. Why not dream of gold?</p>
<p>Scientists say the moon is lifeless, simply borrowing sunlight to exist in the sky as a satellite. So, it's also very pitiful. Our moon worship is meant to mourn for it and offer comfort. If we say again, ["The moon is exceptionally bright during Mid-Autumn,"] we would be mocking it.</p>
<p>Where is the general's mansion? Where are the people in the general's mansion? Have they seen that Liaoyang moon? Perhaps some are admiring the Qinhuai moon, some the Xijiang moon, and some... only the tens of millions of ordinary people who can't leave are left to watch the Liaoyang moon they don't want to see.</p>
<h3>Admiring the Mid-Autumn Moon Alone</h3>
<p>— Yan Bopuguang</p>
<p>The boundless clear brilliance of the full moon easily evokes homesickness in travelers, especially on Mid-Autumn night. Because the moon is exceptionally bright during Mid-Autumn, thinking of one's hometown inevitably leads to thinking of the suffering of the people who have lost the Northeast. Although eating Mid-Autumn mooncakes, how can one swallow them?</p>
<p>The wandering of life is very painful. A folk song sung by Lai Fu fully expresses this: [The curved moon shines over the nine provinces, some rejoice, some grieve. Some couples share a bed, some wander far away.] It feels like joy and sorrow are unevenly distributed. Many compatriots still suffer due to the disparity between rich and poor classes. On one hand, people are feasting on ham mooncakes, lotus seed paste mooncakes, assorted nut mooncakes, etc. On the other hand, the poor don't even have tree bark or grass roots to eat. When Li Wenjun of Yangzhou was cleaning the Baihua Terrace, he casually wrote this couplet: [Everyone in this world only values the rich and noble. Month after month has a moon, yet everyone admires the Mid-Autumn moon alone.] This is a very humorous satire of those who curry favor with the powerful. In reality, equality is unattainable. However, a person should not only value the rich and noble and admire the Mid-Autumn moon alone; they should also think of the masses. Otherwise, while we are busy eating mooncakes, the people of the Northeast will forever be in dire straits. I wonder what friends who admire the Mid-Autumn moon alone think about this?</p>
<h3>The Beautiful Moon Sister</h3>
<p>— Chi Fo</p>
<p>The flowers of spring and the moon of autumn are the best comforts in life. In this clear, high sky and fragrant osmanthus season, the moon feels especially lovely. The ancients said: "The moon is exceptionally bright during Mid-Autumn." We naturally have many thoughts about this autumn night's moon.</p>
<p>The moon is feminine, therefore gentle and charming. Li Shangyin called her "Moon Sister": [Moon Sister once met the descended colorful toad [Moon Fairy], Moon Fairy is not necessarily a beautiful girl.] How romantic and lovely this is! Everyone has always viewed the moon as female, like [Heng E] and [Chang E]. I think that no matter how much women adorn themselves, they can never match the natural charm of the [exquisite, bright moon, pure and clear sky - a solemn and beautiful Moon Sister]. Wearing simple clothes and light makeup, neither modern nor romantic, eternally elegant and clear, human women cannot compare. In the past, when Du Fu lived in troubled times, he was saddened by the sight of the moon and wrote: [Tonight, the Fuzhou moon, only watched alone in the boudoir!] Now that we are trapped in noisy and bustling cities, can we not have similar feelings to Old Du when we look up at the moon?</p>
<p>The moon is like a beauty, hence the saying "the previous life of the bright moon." There is a poem inscribed on a painting of Chang E by Ren Bonian of Shanyin: [Chang E is the true essence of the Taiyin, stealing medicine in Yaochi, returning to the Toad Palace to purify her essence. Clear brilliance forever illuminates the eight realms. She has lived for countless eons, has stood tall on the cold planet. Near and far she is my neighbor, blue skies and seas can't find her former life.] Modern women specially write about the [The Moon resembles my love and the mirror resembles me the mirror will forever stay by his side, the moon to all places I can not follow please send my light to his side] a poem about a girl comparing the moon to her lover, a嬌憨, resentful implication between the lines. The beautiful Moon Sister, her weight is truly astonishing. Astronomers say that the moon weighs about 75 trillion tons, which is 75 followed by thirty zeros, about one eighty-eighth of the Earth's weight. There are volcanic remains on its surface, and large areas have diameters of over three hundred li. The surrounding mountains are like castles. Is the Guanghan Qingxu Palace, where Emperor Ming traveled, and the pearl palaces and toad palaces that poets speak of, perhaps this place? But from our perspective on Earth, the exquisite, bright moon and clear sky are, after all, a solemn and beautiful Moon Sister.</p>
<h3>Talking about Mooncakes</h3>
<p>— Xu Jianping</p>
<p>The most famous mooncakes are undoubtedly the Suzhou and Guangdong styles. Among these two, the Suzhou style with clear water rose and the Guangdong style with lotus seed paste are the most delicious.</p>
<p>If you eat lotus seed paste mooncakes with light green bean soup (without dregs), it will not only be fragrant but also refreshing. Everyone complains that clear water rose mooncakes are too sweet, but if you eat them with extremely hot soup, you won't find them cloyingly sweet. Comrades who are particular about eating mooncakes, you might as well try it.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, I bought a very large Guangdong mooncake and used a small knife to draw a simplified map of China on it. First, I cut off a portion of the three northeastern provinces and Rehe to give to my two younger brothers to eat. At first, they didn't understand, so they just ate it when they got it. After they finished eating, I pointed to the remaining mooncake and asked them, "Do you want to eat more?" They both stared blankly at the mooncake for a while before sobbing and saying, "No, we won't eat it! We'll never eat it again!" I think this method is very effective in educating people. Therefore, I hope that elementary school teachers and parents across the country will use this method to instill patriotic ideas in young children.</p>
<h3>A Small Matter</h3>
<p>— Qian Zuizhu</p>
<p>Whatever you say, it's better to do it. Rather than advising others, it's better to ask yourself.</p>
<p>Why am I saying these empty words out of nowhere? It's because the Japanese taught me to be smart.</p>
<p>Ever since the [September 18th Incident] in the year before last, I have been directly and indirectly affected by them. The pressure of the environment and the mental anguish are beyond imagination. I almost ended it all quickly, but after hesitating again and again, I made a resolution:</p>
<p>[Chew on vegetable roots, endure hardship, support the rafters and pillars, and get things done.]</p>
<p>To cope with my environment, and</p>
<p>To be my passive way of serving the country. For the past two years, although the difficult environment has not opened up, it has not trapped me. Only the principle of [not using any foreign goods] is very difficult to maintain. If I'm not careful, I'll buy foreign goods back. For example, kerosene is a necessity for every household. Since there is no domestic product to replace it, I would rather go to the trouble of using a charcoal stove to replace the kerosene stove.</p>
<p>Once, there was a problem with the electrical wiring, and there was no place to get Chinese electrical materials (at that time, there were few or no Chinese light bulb factories). I had no choice but to go to the second-hand shop and pay a high price to buy some to deal with it. If it weren't for business reasons, I would rather go back thirty years and use candles.</p>
<p>In the past two years, countless incidents like this have occurred. I have always adhered to the principle of [use domestic goods if available, if not, rather not use them]. Although I have been troubled by my family and friends several times, they were soon assimilated by me.</p>
<p>Recently, due to the high humidity, both of my feet became ulcerated, and I experienced another test. Seeing a doctor and taking medicine, of course, has no national boundaries. Western medicine can cure the dampness and guaranteed to work quickly. However, I believe that there is no medicine to treat rotten feet in China. Who knows, after searching all the pharmacies, there was no ready-made medicine for rotten feet. After a delay of ten days, the rot had spread, and it was difficult to walk. Some people advised me to buy [1914] or [Ammolin], and some told me to see a Western doctor. I smiled and said, "I'm doing this for [September 19th], so I won't use [1914]. I don't want to be a foreigner's [Ahmolin], so I won't use [Ammolin]. Because there are Chinese doctors, I won't consult a Western doctor."</p>
<p>Heaven does not disappoint those who have a heart. Finally, I found locally produced [plantain grass]. I picked it and applied it immediately. In less than ten days, it was completely cured and worked like a charm. Although this is a small matter, at least I saved a bit of hard-earned money and didn't cheat it into a foreigner's pocket.</p>
<p>[It's up to people to make things happen.] This is what the Japanese taught me.</p>
<h3>Northeast Fourth Company Commander</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Sixteen: Sour and Sad Feelings, Still Sending Blessings, Busy on the Battlefield, Secretly Shifting Troops</p>
<p>Zhao Ziqiang took a full day off today. He put aside all the matters in the military camp and only stayed at home to accompany the guests playing cards. Sometimes, taking advantage of the opportunity to socialize with the Yang family's guests, he would go to the front yard to sit for a while and talk to Guizhi for a few words. Therefore, although he felt extremely busy, his happiness was not diminished. He busied himself through the day. The next morning at six o'clock, he got up because the military discipline stipulated that he had to return to the camp before six o'clock, so he had no choice but to get up before six o'clock. He hurriedly left the gate and walked towards the Xiyuan Camp. At this time, there were no rickshaws out for business in the countryside. He walked alone in the wilderness and saw no one walking around. At the top of the eastern trees, a large golden cloud appeared, shining its golden light flatly onto the wheat fields. The foot-long wheat seedlings in the fields were connected to each other, like a thick green blanket covering the ground. Walking in these wheat fields, the air flowing in the space without sunlight seemed to carry a faint fragrance to people's noses. Breathing this air, one naturally felt a sense of pleasure. Walking felt energetic too. At this time, Zhao Ziqiang felt interested in everything, thinking that after getting married, he would have to travel back and forth on this Xiyuan Haidian road more often. Fortunately, the camp was so close to home that it wouldn't matter if he walked it once a day. Fortunately, he was a soldier, and walking a few miles every day was not a big deal. Moreover, when going home from the camp in the future, he would probably have to walk quickly because his lovely wife would definitely be standing at the gate waiting for him to return. Thinking like this, he couldn't help but laugh to himself. (105)</p>
<p>Small Recipes</p>
<h3>Goddess (Part 3)</h3>
<p>— Shi Heng</p>
<p>I simply unfolded the letter paper, preparing to write to an old friend. In my most troubled times, I always confide my feelings to my dearest people.</p>
<p>She lay on the bed, still staring at me with her eyes open. After a while, she tapped the edge of the bed, beckoning me to come and sleep too. I responded with a smile, holding the pen in my hand, gesturing that she should sleep first, as I still needed to write. She patted the bed again, and I made the same gesture. Helpless, she turned over and went to sleep with a hint of anger.</p>
<p>Before a minute had passed, she was already soundly asleep. From her snoring, I could tell how weary this poor woman had been.</p>
<p>After finishing the letter, the clock on the table pointed to 2 AM. The unfortunate person lying on the bed must have long since entered the distant, distant land of dreams. Almost her entire body was exposed outside the blanket. Her dry, firewood-like legs, her emaciated chest with ribs clearly visible, and her pale, anemic face made me clearly see the unforgivable sins of humanity.</p>
<p>I sat by the bed, gazing at her, but what could I do? Should I also lie down in the same bed and spend this unpleasant night with her? Moreover, in a half-asleep state, wouldn't I be dominated by the fire of lust again?</p>
<p>I gently shook her body, but she didn't stir. I shook her again, but she still didn't wake up, so I called out, "Wake up! Wake up!"</p>
<p>As if caught by a nightmare in a dream, she abruptly woke up. Her drowsy eyes saw me and she gave me a smile again.</p>
<p>But this smile was truly indescribably forced. At any time, in any mood, she had to smile at anyone. This pitiful life of selling smiles had become a habit, a painful habit. What kind of miserable life of humans was revealed in her smile!</p>
<p>"Get up and get dressed," I said, handing her the clothes. She was really not fully awake yet.</p>
<p>"What, are you telling me to leave?" she said, agitated.</p>
<p>I didn't know how to answer her.</p>
<p>"You don't like me?" she cried out, feeling a sense of embarrassing humiliation.</p>
<p>"No, no. It's just that it's very late and I need to sleep," I said, forcing a smile at her.</p>
<p>Although I pitied her and sympathized with her, unable to add another fraction of human destruction to her, she couldn't understand my pity and sympathy. She accepted it as an insult.</p>
<p>When she walked out of my room, I breathed a sigh of relief. The heavy burden on my heart immediately lightened a lot. I hurriedly turned off the light and lay down in bed, but I couldn't sleep. A pungent, unpleasant odor left in the blanket and the scene that had just unfolded were still plaguing my mind.</p>
<p>Not only that night, but for a long time afterward, I always recalled this comedy. Indeed, on the surface, this play was comical, and sometimes I would even laugh to myself thinking about it. But I never laughed more than a couple of times, because behind the comedy, it contained a sour and bitter taste. It was a most tragic comedy that few people experience. September 1933</p>

<p>Gold Price Stable, Slight Drop of Seven Jiao</p>
<p>丨Mid-Autumn Festival Market Closure, Replenishment Not Weak丨</p>
<p>The gold market was extremely stable yesterday, with limited fluctuations. People's hearts were quite firm, and the day's situation lacked waves. Initially, overseas silver markets in England and America rose uniformly, and exchange rates also increased. However, the forward silver price on the Precious Metals Exchange fell by two to five and a half percent. London spot gold rose by four pence, and the U.S. mining gold price was $31.88, also up four jiao and two fen from the previous price. Stocks fell by $1.83, U.S. cotton was down a small four pounds, U.S. wheat shrunk by seventy-five, and the wool market opened with a slight drop. Ultimately, it closed with exchange rates contracting back, and the prices of goods and stocks downstream surged to replenish short positions. Bingxing and others willingly accepted and gradually recovered well. After opening, because the domestic market seemed tight, Anli Foreign Firm settled forward exchanges, leading to a rush to break through the $80 mark. Helplessly, it was learned in advance that HSBC's listed rates were flat for England and fearful of the U.S., leading to a decline. Banks released their holding power. However, with stable sentiment and eager buyers, the decline was not strong. Later trading was scarce, and fluctuations were even smaller. The potential for short covering continued. It is expected that during the Mid-Autumn Festival market closure in these two days, the silver price and exchange rate are defending against further declines. Western merchants also came to replenish their positions, and the market continued to be stable. Checking the day's market situation, there were no special changes. Whether the U.S. dollar will change is still difficult to predict, resulting in more silence. The bid-ask spread was one thousand one hundred and ten yuan. The day's market situation is recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was $777.7 jiao, down 4 jiao from the previous close. Goods opened at the same price. The exchange market opened with near-term selling prices of one shilling and three pence thirteen seventy-five for British exchange, and $30.75 for U.S. exchange. Shanghai Mitsui locked in $125 of December U.S. dollars, Yiyu Hengxing sold for 6 yuan and 2 jiao. As if Yuanmao Yongbing Xing Dade Cheng Hengyu Daxing Yongshun Liyixun Yonghengxing and others joined together to buy strips, Majiali and others bought January U.S. dollars at three and seven-five. Mitsui bought again at three and one-one five. The exchange market was tight, and the price rose to 80 yuan and 8 jiao. It was known in advance that HSBC Bank's listing was flat for England and the U.S. continued to rise 125. Yuanchun Zhifeng Yonghengyu Fuyu Goods and others scrambled to sell, and the price fell to 77 yuan and a half. Zhaofengchang still bought, and it rose again to 9 yuan and a half. Yuanmao sold for 7 yuan and 2 jiao. The exchange market was quite good, and the banks' appetite was very strong. At this time, Hengyu took advantage of the high price to supply, Datong came out with November U.S. dollars at 875, retreating to within 7 yuan. Changsheng Yongfuyu Tongxingyong and others also sold, Datong stuffed in November U.S. dollars at 875 and $31, and the price fell to 75 yuan. Hengyu Hengtai Chunyuan Yongfuyu and others took advantage of the low price to buy again. Mitsui actually bought January U.S. dollars at 375, also recovering to 8 yuan and 6 jiao. HSBC put out November U.S. dollars at 875 yuan. Shengyong Qingfa Yong Goods and others supplied strips, and the price retreated to 6 yuan. The afternoon closing for Qing was 776 yuan and 6 jiao. Goods were auctioned at 6 yuan and 8 jiao.</p>
<p>The after-market opened at 776 yuan and 7 jiao, with goods opening at 6 yuan and 3 jiao. The volume of transactions was sparse in the early session, and the situation was calm, with only a few jiao being counted. It lasted for quite a while. As Shanghai ate January U.S. dollars at 375, Hengtai Fuyu and others bought strips, and the price rose from 6 yuan to 7 yuan and 7 jiao. Sumitomo and Zhejiang locked in December U.S. dollars at 125, and the price retreated to 7 yuan. Hengxing limited the order and purchased aggressively, making it difficult to retreat further. Hengyu also bought, struggling outside of 7 yuan. As Citibank came out with November U.S. dollars at 9375, Yuanmao Chunyuan Yongfuchang Zhengchang all sold, and the price fell to 6 yuan and 2 jiao. Bingxing bought strips, and Hengxing also limited the price to buy strips, and the price gradually rose to outside 7 yuan. Retail suppliers of goods, Sumitomo locked in January U.S. dollars at 375 yuan. Xingyong, although buying, still lowered the price to 6 yuan and 2 jiao. Hengxing limited the order and purchased again. Tianfeng Zhifeng Yong and others all bought, surging to 7 yuan and 8 jiao. The closing price was 777 yuan and 4 jiao. After the market closed, Hengxing bought strips and briefly saw a slight increase, but because goods and the Dalian gang supplied, the price dropped again to 6 yuan and a half internally. Finally, the price was around 7 yuan. Goods were auctioned at 7 yuan and a half. Checking the day, the highest price was 780 yuan and 8 jiao, and the lowest price was 775 yuan, with a difference of 5 yuan and 8 jiao. As a result, the closing price was slightly down 7 jiao compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The listed price was 30 yuan and 375 fen, an increase of 125 fen for the HSBC Bank U.S. dollar listing, equivalent to a standard gold price of 790 yuan. Based on the closing price, it was approximately 12 yuan more than the previous close, which was about 2 yuan more than the previous close. The registered price for this month was 785 yuan, and for November, it was 777 yuan. The morning water replenishment was 785 yuan, and the afternoon water replenishment was 785 yuan. The bid-ask spread was 1,110 yuan. Trading in the venue was quieter, and both supply and demand were silent. The official transaction was from 1,111 yuan to 1,112 yuan, with Dongfengyong slightly buying approximately 3-400 taels.</p>
<p>Trading in the venue was average. Generally, Shunli Yuanxingyong Bingxing Hengtai Tongchun Zhifeng Yonghengyu Chunyuan Yong Zhaofengchang etc. were on the buying side. Yuanmao Xiexing Yong Changsheng Yong Yuanheng Yiyu Fuchang Fuyu Tongxingyong Qingfayong etc. were on the selling side. Hengxing Zhifengyong Yuanchun Fuyu first went out and then came in. Dadecheng Yuanmao Yong etc. first came in and then went out. Dalian helped Shunli to do a total of more than 2,400 strips, rolling in more than 1,100 strips. Wanxing did a total of more than 1,300 strips, rolling in more than 100 strips. Guangdong helped Hengxing to enter more than 300 strips and exit more than 200 strips. There are currently 1,260 strips left for this month, and a total of 26,992 chips for November.</p>

Compared to the previous close, English was tight by 0.0625 and American was hard by 0.0625. After opening, the banks bought far and sold near, and the situation seemed tight. Because HSBC announced the listing, English was flat and the U.S. continued to rise by 125, the domestic market gradually turned hard. However, because banks took advantage of the low price to buy, the process was stable. Later, the price fluctuations were narrow and the volume of transactions was relatively quiet. By the closing, the near-term price was one shilling and three pence three-seven-five for British exchange, and 30 yuan and 6875 fen for U.S. exchange.

<p>Securities Gold Long Bonds Especially Good Three Jiao</p>
<p>Most Bonds Rose and Few Fell, Only One or Two Jiao Difference</p>
<p>Market Notice: Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival, Market Closed for One Day</p>
<p>Yesterday, trading on the Chinese Securities Exchange was relatively quiet. It was reported that the government planned to issue 50 million in new treasury bonds, which was 70 million less than the previous rumor of 120 million. Therefore, it did not have much impact on the market, because the domestic financial strain did not start today. Regardless of the difficulties, the principal and interest on the bonds were never missed each month. The credit of the bonds became more and more solid. The current environment was relatively stable, and the financial sector had enough capacity to absorb the bonds. Therefore, the bond market not only did not fall yesterday, but actually saw a slight increase. At the initial opening in the morning, some short sellers released some positions, falling slightly by 2 jiao. After that, because No. 47 still absorbed positions, it turned from flat to rising. Following the Twentieth Customs, it was still slightly small by about 1 jiao. In the second round, the suppression of soldiers reversed and rose by 3 jiao and a half to 4 jiao and a half, and the rest also followed well by 1-2 jiao. In the afternoon, No. 47's buying appetite was satisfied, and sporadic longs emerged, slightly falling back by 1-2 jiao. The closing transaction was quite scattered. Retail investors only sold, and it fell slightly by 1-2 jiao again. The market price resulted in more rises than falls, with increases and decreases between 1-2 jiao. Only the gold long bond was especially good, rising by 3 jiao. The total number of transactions was 7,264,000 yuan, including 14,000 yuan in spot goods. The futures totaled 3,370,000 for salt tax, 981,000 for soldier suppression, 630,000 for the Nineteenth Customs, and 1,055,000 for the Twentieth Customs. There were tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands, depending on the case.</p>
<p>New York Stock Market Continues to Fall</p>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm Report, 2nd: The New York stock market continued to decline. The rebound on Saturday of last week could not be maintained. The reason for this was largely due to the fall in the stock of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, but there was no obvious reason. It is expected that the next report of the telephone company will be very good, and the dividends will not change. The market situation implies a further decline. A cautious policy will follow. The total number of shares traded for the day was 960,000. [Wheat] The market situation requires new stimulation. There are too many frustrated longs who are closing positions. Unless the current situation changes, it will be difficult to maintain a solid forward trend. [Cotton] The borrowing capacity of farmers exceeds the current forward cotton price, so short-term sales may be reduced. It is currently very favorable to buy. [Silver] Due to speculative trading, the silver market closed loosely. The Dow Jones Index is listed below.</p>
<p>Closing Price Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>Thirty Industrial Stocks 92.99 Down 1.83</p>
<p>Twenty Railroad Stocks 40.16 Down 0.79</p>
<p>Twenty Utility Stocks 24.87 Down 0.74</p>
<p>Forty Bonds 83.81 Down 0.15</p>
<p>Yarn Market: Raw Yarn Soft, Finished Yarn Firm</p>
<p>The yarn market fell in the morning and was flat at noon, but the situation was softer than yesterday. Due to the poor environment, all gangs are suffering from economic difficulties and have no active purchasing power for actual sales. Therefore, the extraordinary enthusiasm of customer sales on the previous day has now subsided again. According to one part, there may be a development after the Mid-Autumn Festival, so the amount absorbed by a certain factory has remained unchanged. At the close, there was also a slight purchase. It is heard that the British firm Yihe Factory is opening a large amount of 20-count Wufu Shepherd yarn during the rise, but the price, amount, and time limit are kept secret.</p>
<p>Yarn Falls Seven, Eight, Nine Jiao</p>
<p>Renbiao: It was heard that sales of spot yarn had stopped at the opening of the previous market. Longs closed positions, and the market fell, with drops of eight, nine, and jiao to one yuan in each month. In the afternoon, the longs of a certain factory increased their positions, and each month rebounded by one, two, and three jiao. The total number of transactions for the day was 27,700 bales. It was found that 1,450 bales of Yuda, 1,150 bales of Yuanda, 1,450 bales of Changfeng, 650 bales of Yiyu, and 600 bales of Yuantai were sold. 1,100 bales of Yuanda, 1,150 bales of Mingde, 2,000 bales of Yichang, and 950 bales of Xinhua were purchased. The closing prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Renbiao Closing Price Increase/Decrease Balance</p>
<p>January 186.6 Down 1.7 1,700,000</p>
<p>October 184.2 Down 0.75 555,002</p>
<p>February 187.0 645,550</p>
<p>November 185.3 873,800</p>
<p>March 187.7 677,100</p>
<p>December 185.9 868,000</p>
<p>Total 1,324,350</p>
<p>Spot Sales Degenerate Again</p>
<p>The quantity of spot yarn sold was less than yesterday, but the Yunnan gang bought 1,640 bales of term yarn. It was found that the total number of bales bought by each gang for the day was 455, and the market price fell by 5 jiao. The amount purchased by each gang is as follows:</p>
<p>Zhenjiang 50 Datong 5 Inland 75</p>
<p>Yunnan 1640 Fellow Traders 15 Guangdong 125</p>
<p>Shantou 65 Xiamen 10 Luzhou 25</p>
<p>Sichuan 75 Ningbo 10</p>
<p>Cotton Market Remains Firm, Market Sentiment Quite High: The trading volume for October was too large, and the buyers insisted, so although the selling price of spot cotton fell, the forward cotton was hard. Most people expect that general scattered shorts have no spot goods to deliver, and will inevitably replenish, so the attitude of the longs is getting stronger. Spot cotton sales remain stagnant. Factories are constrained by finance and cannot absorb large quantities.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Stands Still</p>
<p>Zheng Biao: The market sentiment was still flat at the opening of the previous market, with each month slightly falling by 5 fen to 1 jiao, but this month was very strong, rising by 5 fen. In the afternoon, the shorts replenished, and this month rose again by 5 fen, and the far term rose by 5 fen. The total number of transactions for the day was 54,900 dan. It was found that 3,200 dan of Chunji, 1,500 dan of Gengfeng, 2,800 dan of Changyu, 2,000 dan of Tongxing, 2,900 dan of Hengde, 3,400 dan of Dachang, and 3,100 dan of Yuanxingchang were sold. 9,500 dan of Tongji, 6,100 dan of Renfeng, 1,200 dan of Xiesheng, 3,100 dan of Changhe, and 1,700 dan of Yifeng were purchased. The closing prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Closing Price Increase/Decrease Balance</p>

<p>Factories Need Lively</p>
<p>The need for spot cotton is still good. The source is 2,000 bales of Tonghua and 1,860 bales of Yaohua. The opening prices for spot cotton are as follows:</p>
<p>Taicang Cotton 38.50 Shenxin Factory purchased 2,000 bales Spot goods delivered to the factory</p>

<p>American Cotton Closed with Southern Futures Sales</p>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market rose first due to purchases by peers, and then fell due to Southern futures sales and weakness on Wall Street. As a result, spot goods fell by five pounds, and futures fell by four to nine pounds. The Liverpool cotton market fell by three points for spot goods and six to seven points for futures. The Egyptian cotton spot goods fell by one point. The Bombay cotton market was firm due to short covering. As a result, Pinggar rose by half a roby, Aomura rose by two robies, and White Luo Creek rose by one roby and seven and a half. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram dated 2nd).</p>

<p>Bombay Cotton Industry Weekly Report</p>
<p>The market was calm last week. At the beginning of the week, the market fell due to the poor economic situation of the factories, speculative sales, and long liquidations. After that, the factory situation turned, and the market price slightly recovered. At the same time, the Textile Conference in Shimla, in addition to the expansion of trade between Japan and India, had no major resolutions, but it received attention. On the spot goods side, it remained bleak. Inquiries from China and Japan were insignificant. It is said that the cotton harvest report showed no significant losses due to the weather turning sunny. The statistics for the past week are recorded below (unit: thousand bales).</p>

<p>Grain: Rice Prices Rose and Fell Unevenly</p>
<p>丨Today Mid-Autumn Festival Stop Pecks丨</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Sources from over 30 number of odd lots, the stomach is slightly better than yesterday, and ultimately it is still limited with the festival approaching. The total stomach capacity is 1,450 bags. The market situation continues to rise, but the rise and fall are uneven. Chang Bang, Su Bang, and Nan Gang, etc., continued to offer broken japonica, while japonica corners, pine Si thin paddy only slightly rose a few points. New and old various tip types are close to the market because of more ships arriving. New japonica has no change in honor or disgrace, and there is no market. The market will be closed tomorrow on the Mid-Autumn Festival, according to the lunar calendar.</p>
<p>(Shanghai Market) 26-7 ships from various sources. The stomach capacity of each item on the market is average. High broken and secondary new japonica are slightly tight. Middle and secondary white japonica, new japonica, variant yuan thin paddy, new and old sheep tip, new Du tip, round tip, port tip, and customer tip etc. have slight ups and downs. Jiashan new hundred fruits are now on the market, with only a few stones, and the price opens at 7 yuan and 5 jiao. Today, the market will be closed according to custom on the Mid-Autumn Festival.</p>
<p>Hunan Rough Jing Rice Sales Lively, Prices Rise</p>
<p>Yesterday, there were not many new arrivals of customer indica rice. The Fujian gang's stomach capacity was still lively, and the arrival of rice from the river was slow, leading to a surge in prices. This street also inquired about customer indica rice, so the market turned to a safe station. Yesterday, Ningbo and Quanzhou and Fuzhou in Fujian Province unanimously competed for Hunan rough Jing rice prices. The price remained tired and rebounded, and the price was higher than the previous day by a jiao. 1,380 bags were opened, with prices ranging from 5 yuan and 8 jiao to 5 yuan and 5 jiao 3 fen. Hunan machine Jing was also brought up by nearly a jiao. 200 bags were sent from Fuzhou, with prices ranging from 7 yuan 4 jiao 8 fen to 7 yuan 3 jiao 8 fen. Fuzhou also sent 90 bags of new Jiangsu rice from Jiangxi, with a price of 7 yuan 6 jiao half. Quanzhou sent 210 bags of Wuxi machine rice, with a price of 7 yuan 07 fen. 200 bags of Jiangbei machine rice had a price of 6 yuan 6 jiao 8 fen.</p>
<p>Flour Gradually Declining</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, each month uniformly showed a tired and stagnant trend. The quotation for foreign wheat in Chicago and Canada was also small by one or two jiao. The market sentiment was caused by the fact that the actual sales were not good and the spot prices were cheaper than the standard. This situation is actually a fundamental and difficult-to-recover bad phenomenon. Therefore, although the factories have not dumped, the opening prices are gradually falling. By the time the afternoon market opened, the situation for this month was still stable due to floating shorts absorbing, while the far term fell again. It is rumored that Australian No. 3 goods were being sold by foreign firms for 4 yuan and 3 jiao. The factories had no intention of trying to set a price because it was not easy to dump the flour. It can be seen that foreign surplus dumping is still inevitable. If there is an opportunity to enter, the market will be more tired. Since there is no way to vent the accumulated powder in the country, the world's pressure is also catering to domestic consumption. I am afraid that it will be difficult to find a remedy for the future for a while. As a result, this month was smaller than the previous day by one and a half fen, November fell by two fen seven li half, December fell by two fen, January fell by two</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Province Education Statistics for the 20th Year</h3>
<p>While the Zhejiang Province Education Statistics for the 20th year mostly indicate quantitative issues, there is very little representation of quality. However, the facts revealed by the quantity are very concrete and accurate, sufficient as an important basis for various reforms. The province's education statistics for the 20th year have already been compiled by the Department of Education, and the most significant facts are excerpted below for the reference of those studying education in the province.</p>
<p>Elementary Education</p>
<p>(1) Qualifications and Treatment of Elementary School Teachers. According to the statistics for the 20th year, the qualifications of elementary school teachers in the province who graduated from normal schools (including senior high school normal courses, old-system normal schools, various short-term normal schools, and higher normal schools) accounted for 21.6% of the total. Graduates from other schools (including elementary schools, secondary schools, and colleges) accounted for 62.1%, and non-school graduates accounted for 16.3%. Furthermore, the average monthly salary of elementary school teachers in the province was 10.84 yuan (the above refers to the situation in the entire province; of course, Hangzhou and a few other excellent counties have much higher averages than the provincial average).</p>
<p>(2) Increase in the Number of Elementary Schools and Students. In the 20th year, there were 11,736 elementary schools in the province with 683,601 students. Compared with the 19th year, there was an increase of 40 schools and 23,876 students. This increase may seem small when viewed as a whole, but when averaged over 76 counties and cities, each county and city increased by only 5.3 schools and 314 students per year, which cannot be considered large.</p>
<p>(3) Estimation of the Number of School-Age Children Out of School in the Province. The exact number of school-age children in the province is unknown. However, according to the second population survey of the province, the population was 21,249,898. Usually, one-tenth of the population is used to estimate the number of school-age children, so the number of school-age children in the province should be 2,124,990. According to the statistics for the 20th year, the number of school-age children enrolled in schools in the province was 622,408 (calculated based on elementary school junior students; elementary school senior students and private school students are not included). From this, it can be estimated that the number of school-age children out of school in the province is 1,502,582, accounting for approximately 70.7% of the total. Furthermore, according to the statistics for the 20th year, the average annual expenditure per elementary school student is approximately 7 yuan. Multiplying this number by the number of out-of-school children yields 10,518,074 yuan. In other words, based on the current economic situation, an annual recurring expenditure (excluding start-up costs) of 10,518,074 yuan would be needed to enable all school-age children in the province to attend school.</p>
<p>(4) Quantity of Various Averages and the Sufficiency of School Content. According to the statistics for the 20th year, the average number of students per elementary school in the province was 58.25, the average number of classes per school was 1.85, the average number of students taught per teacher was 24.44, and the average number of students per class was 31.68.</p>
<p>(5) The Position of Private Elementary Schools in the Elementary Schools of the Province. According to the statistics for the 20th year, there were 836 county and municipal elementary schools in the province, accounting for 7.13% of the total, 5,717 district and township elementary schools, accounting for 48.71% of the total, and 5,183 private elementary schools, accounting for 44.16% of the total. Compared with Jiangsu Province, the number of public elementary schools in this province is less than that of Jiangsu Province, while the number of private elementary schools is greater. These private elementary schools can be an auxiliary for promoting compulsory education and are extremely important. The large number of them is very encouraging.</p>
<p>(6) Differences in the Elementary Education Status of Various Counties and Cities. The level of educational development varies greatly among the counties and cities in this province due to differences in area, population, financial resources, and ease of transportation. These differences can be seen by comparing the numbers shown on the statistical tables of the various counties and cities. It is not described in detail here. However, one important phenomenon to note is that the number of counties and cities with various elementary education quantities below the average is greater than the number above the average. In other words, the distribution of quantities in the counties and cities is skewed towards the smaller end. Only a few counties and cities have relatively well-developed education, while most counties are in the underdeveloped category. For example, in the 20th year, the total expenditure on elementary education in the counties and cities of the province was 4,811,672 yuan (public and private funds combined), averaging approximately 63,312 yuan per county and city. However, only 21 counties and 1 city were above 63,312 yuan, while 54 counties were above 63,312 yuan.</p>
<p>Secondary Education</p>
<p>(1) Comparison of the Establishment of Secondary Schools in the Province. According to the statistics for the 20th year, there were 20 provincial secondary schools, 51 county and municipal joint secondary schools, and 51 private secondary schools in the province. The expenditures were 1,084,093 yuan for provincial schools, 384,877 yuan for county, municipal, and joint schools, and 757,596 yuan for private schools. The expenditure of private schools is less than that of provincial schools, and the expenditure of county, municipal, and joint schools is even less than that of private schools. Because county, municipal, and joint schools have less funding, their content cannot be excellent. The results of the secondary school graduation joint examination in the 21st year show that provincial schools were generally superior, private schools had both inferior and superior schools, and county and municipal joint schools were mostly very inferior. It can be seen that the amount of funding has a significant relationship with the quality of content.</p>
<p>(2) Comparison of the Number of Students in Various Departments of Secondary Schools in the Province. According to the statistics for the 20th year, the number of students in various departments of secondary schools in the province was 16,620 in junior high school, accounting for 75.66% of the total, 1,851 in senior high school general courses, accounting for 8.43% of the total, 1,823 in senior high school normal courses and short-term normal training courses, accounting for 8.30% of the total, and 1,671 in senior and junior high school vocational courses, accounting for 7.61%. Judging from the above numbers, the percentage of junior high school students is very large, while the vocational and normal departments are very small. Looking at the statistics for previous years, the percentage of junior high school students has also been gradually increasing, accounting for 73% in the 18th year. 7% in the 19th year, 74.05% in the 20th year, and 75.66% in the 20th year.</p>
<p>(3) Qualifications of Secondary School Teachers. Judging from the statistics for the 20th year, the qualifications of secondary school teachers in the province (excluding staff) are as follows: university graduates accounted for 31.81%, normal university and higher normal school graduates accounted for 10.44%, vocational school graduates accounted for 25.05%, those who studied abroad accounted for 6.06%, and others accounted for 26.64%. The "others" category mostly includes those in county and private schools, while there are very few in provincial schools.</p>
<p>(4) Various Averages of Secondary Schools in the Province. According to the statistics for the 20th year, the average number of students per secondary school in the province was 180.04, the average number of classes per school was 5.39, the average number of students per class was 33.38, and the average number of students per teacher was 8.08. Comparing the above averages with the aforementioned elementary school situation, the average number of students and classes per school is larger in secondary schools than in elementary schools, while the number of students per teacher is smaller in secondary schools than in elementary schools. Furthermore, the average annual expenditure per student in secondary schools was 101.37 yuan, approximately 14.5 times greater than that of elementary school students (the average annual expenditure per elementary school student is approximately 7 yuan).</p>
<p>Social Education</p>
<p>(1) Increase in the Number of Mass Education Schools and Mass Education Centers Over the Years. The number of mass education schools in the province was 311 in the 17th year, 1,059 in the 18th year, 1,460 in the 19th year, and 1,712 in the 20th year. Judging from the above numbers, the number of mass education schools in the province has been increasing every year since the 18th year. The increase in the 18th year was the most significant, with an increase of more than three times compared to the 17th year. The number of mass education centers in the province was 21 in the 17th year, 48 in the 18th year, 82 in the 19th year, and 95 in the 20th year. The above numbers have also been increasing every year.</p>
<p>(2) Ratio of Graduates to Non-Graduates in Mass Education Schools. Students in mass education schools often drop out halfway, so the number of graduates is not large. According to the statistics for the 20th year, there were a total of 62,169 students in mass education schools in the province, of which 23,073 graduated. The ratio of graduates to non-graduates is approximately 1 to 1.7.</p>
<p>(3) Various Averages of Mass Education Schools in the Province. According to the statistics for the 20th year, the average number of students per mass education school in the province was 36.3, the average number of students per class was 29.1, and the average number of students per teacher was 14.3. The above averages are not very large. Since most teachers in mass education schools are part-time, it is difficult to increase the average number of students taught per person.</p>
<p>(4) Estimation of the Number of Out-of-School Adults in the Province. According to the results of the first population survey, the population of the province was 21,249,898. According to the estimation method for out-of-school adults stipulated by the Ministry of Education (see the National Education Reform Plan compiled by the Education Program Preparation Committee of the Ministry of Education in June of the 19th year), using 46.5% of the total population to estimate, the number of out-of-school adults in the province should be 9,881,202. Furthermore, according to the statistics for the 20th year, the average expenditure per student in mass education schools in the province was 1.3 yuan. Assuming that this number is used as the standard, the total expenditure required to promote adult literacy education in the province is 21,845,563 yuan (i.e., the product of 1.3 yuan and the number of out-of-school adults).</p>
<p>(5) Differences in Social Education in Various Counties and Cities. According to the statistics for the 20th year, the county with the most mass education schools had 93, while the county with the least had 1. The county with the most mass education centers had 6, while the county with the least had 1. The county with the most social education expenditure (calculated based on county and city funds) had 30,635 yuan, while the county with the least had 663 yuan.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education Orders All Provinces and Cities to</p>
<p>Conscientiously Promote Vocational Education</p>
<p>Orders Issued for Procedures and Subjects for Promoting Vocational Education</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 3rd) The Ministry of Education believes that while most provinces and cities have conscientiously implemented the regulations and measures for promoting vocational education promulgated by the Ministry, there are also many that are following the status quo or failing to seriously implement them due to special local circumstances. In order to expand vocational education, the Ministry has specially formulated the Outline of Procedures for Promoting Vocational Education in Provinces, Cities, and Counties and Measures for the Registration, Verification, and Training of Teachers in Vocational Schools and Vocational Subjects, ordering all departments and bureaus to conscientiously implement them and report the implementation status to the Ministry for verification at any time.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education Self-Compiles Elementary School Textbooks</p>
<p>Arithmetic, Natural Science, and Social Studies Have Become Initial Drafts</p>
<p>In order to make textbooks suitable for the new curriculum standards and to align with the teaching progress, the Ministry of Education has formulated measures for self-compiling textbooks. The Ordinary Department of the Ministry of Education and the National Compilation and Translation Bureau jointly hire or designate specialists to be responsible for editing, and assessment committee members are appointed for detailed reviews to ensure perfection. Regarding the editing work, several meetings have been held in the past few months, starting with the editing of elementary school textbooks. It is reported that the initial drafts of three types of elementary school textbooks, namely arithmetic, natural science, and social studies, have been compiled and will be reviewed in several assessment meetings before they can be approved. In addition, the initial draft of the national language textbook is currently only half compiled, and the editing of the remaining subjects will be carried out in sequence.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education Sends a Large Number of</p>
<p>Inspectors in Three Batches This Month</p>
<p>The First Batch Departs Around the 15th</p>
<p>The Second Batch Departs in the Middle of the Month</p>
<p>The Third Batch Departs at the End of the Month</p>
<p>In order to investigate the facilities for vocational secondary schools, normal education, compulsory education, and mass education in various provinces and cities across the country, the Ministry of Education has formulated eight investigation items regarding the above types of education and issued them to the education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities, requiring them to pay close attention to the eight items and make full preparations of relevant materials in advance to facilitate implementation and the inspection by the Ministry's personnel. It is now reported that more than ten personnel appointed by the Ministry to go to various provinces and cities, except for Section Chief Wu Yan, who needs to delay his departure to the end of the month due to the affairs of the Ordinary Department, will depart and inspect various places. The departure dates and locations of the inspectors are roughly as follows: Nanjing City will be inspected by Inspector and Section Chief of the Ordinary Department Zhong Daozan around the 15th of this month. Zhejiang Province will be inspected by Inspector Dai Xia around the 15th of this month. Fujian will be inspected by Inspector Tang Xifen around the 15th of this month. Henan and Shaanxi Provinces will be inspected by Inspector Zhou Bangdao around the 15th of this month. Suiyuan and Chahar will be inspected by Inspector Yuan Zhaoxi around the 15th of this month. Shanghai will be inspected by Director Gu Shusen. Jiangsu will be inspected by Councilor Chen Shizhen. Hebei will be inspected by Education Director of the Ordinary Department Dai Yingguan. Shandong and Qingdao City will be inspected by Commissioner Guo Youshou. Anhui and Jiangxi will be inspected by Commissioner Li Ximou. Guangdong and Guangxi will be inspected by Councilor Chen Panzao, etc. The above departures will take place around the middle of this month. Hubei and Hunan will be inspected by Section Chief of the Ordinary Department Wu Yan around the end of this month. In addition, due to inconvenient transportation, provinces such as the three northeastern provinces, Rehe, Gansu, Ningxia, Xikang, Qinghai, Sichuan, Xinjiang, Yunnan, and Guizhou will not be inspected for the time being. This inspection focuses on ordinary education (including secondary school vocational normal compulsory education, with the primary and secondary school portions being the majority), and incidentally inspects mass education in social education, so the Planning Department of the Ministry of Education has not sent personnel to join the inspection.</p>

<h3>Watching a Magic Show</h3>
<p>— You Guang</p>
<p>I love to watch [magic shows].</p>
<p>They are traveling performers, so the magic shows are the same everywhere. In order to collect money, there are two necessary things: a black bear and a child.</p>
<p>The black bear is so thin from hunger that it almost doesn't have the strength to move. Naturally, this is because it cannot be made strong, because if it becomes strong, it cannot be controlled. Now it is half-dead, but it still has its nose pierced with an iron ring and is led around with a rope to perform. Sometimes it is given a little something to eat, which is a small piece of water-soaked bread crust, but the spoon is still held high, and it is made to stand up, stretch its head, and open its mouth for a long time before it can get it into its stomach, and the magician therefore collects some money.</p>
<p>No one in China has mentioned the origin of this bear. According to Westerners' investigations, it is said that it was caught in the mountains when it was young... large ones cannot be used, because once they are large, they can never change their wild nature. However, even if they are small, they still need to be [trained]. The method of [training] is [beating] and [starving], and later they die from abuse. I am afraid that this is indeed true. When we see it still alive and performing, it seems that it doesn't even have the breath of a bear anymore. In some places, it is even called a [dog bear], and its contempt is so great.</p>
<p>The child also has to suffer on the stage. Either the adult steps on his stomach or twists his hands behind his back. He shows a very painful, very difficult, very burdensome expression to ask the audience to rescue him with six, five, then four, three... and the magician collects some more money.</p>
<p>He must have been trained, but this pain is faked and is a collusion with the adult. However, it does not hinder making money.</p>
<p>Knocking gongs to open the show in the afternoon, doing this until closing the show at night. The audience scatters, some having spent money, some ultimately not having spent money.</p>
<p>Every time I close the show, as I walk, I think of two money-making tools. One is to be abused to death, and then a young one is sought. The other is that after they grow up, another child and a little bear are sought to continue performing the same show.</p>
<p>The matter is really very simple and seems to be boring to think about. However, I still often watch it. What else do you want me to watch, everyone?</p>
<h3>Starting with a Strange Book</h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>The article construction method recently published by Wenhua Fine Arts Publishing Company can be said to be an unprecedented strange book. This book titled [Yang Xingfo] is fake, and the title [Yang Renpian edited] is also fake. Shadowing names is not uncommon in Shanghai, but the strangest thing is that this book is a real book. In the 12th year of the Republic of China, Liang Rengong gave a lecture on the teaching method of composition above the middle school level at Southeast University. Wei Shisheng and Dong Shicheng took notes, which were published by Zhonghua Book Company. The notes were followed by Liang Rengong's unfinished manuscript of the emotions expressed in Chinese rhyme literature, which he lectured on at Tsinghua University. Wenhua's article construction method is a verbatim reprint of Zhonghua's teaching method of composition above the middle school level. Reprints of a dead man's work are called another dead man to bear the name of plagiarism, which is a rare wonder in the world. Yang Xingfo, who has suffered this injustice, must be calling out grievances in the underground. Yang Renpian is also in a bad mood (it is said that another Yang Renpian in Beiping saw Wenhua's reply letter). He made a cameo appearance in a double-package case for no reason.</p>
<p>The emergence of this strange phenomenon is not accidental.</p>
<p>From the root, this is a projection of the decline of the Chinese cultural world. In recent years, the publishing world has been almost dead. Breathing is too unfree, and no one dares to publish valuable works... because speaking right and wrong and talking about the truth is dangerous. Booksellers are careful to avoid fire and can only think of tricks on children and young people... The competition for children's books and the competition for teaching materials are manifestations of the publishing world having no way to go. Works such as the article construction method are wonderful in that they do not provoke right and wrong. Wenhua's motive for publishing the article construction method is probably nothing more than this. When all the tricks have been exhausted and there is no way to change the styles of works such as the article construction method, such as Wenhua's reprinting of Zhongdeng's teaching method of composition above the middle school level, the publishing industry has reached a dead end and is waiting for the end.</p>
<p>In terms of the works on how to write articles that have already been published, before reading the writing method, the articles are like this... After reading the writing method, the articles are still like this. It can be seen that the writing method is just a method. Liang Rengong's discussion on the teaching method of composition above the middle school level is one of the best. Wenhua has taken a fancy to this kind of verbatim reprint (the emotions expressed in Chinese rhyme literature in Zhonghua's publication are not complete manuscripts, and the ones published in the Yinbing Room Anthology are complete manuscripts). It is not without merit, at least it is more meaningful than reprinting another kind of writing method. After what exams do young people think that articles are the only stepping stone in life? The article construction method should sell very well. Living people cannot write a book worth reading for living people, and dead people are still invited to set up the stage. The fulfillment of Chinese academia can be known.</p>
<p>Alas, I am not only sighing for strange books!</p>
<h3>Lili is Sick</h3>
<p>— Wei Zenben</p>
<p>Lili is sick.</p>
<p>Crying all day long, as if she has forgotten how to smile forever.</p>
<p>She cries in bed, cries in her mother's arms, cries when drinking medicine (but laughs when eating things)...</p>
<p>The illness is mild, but she still cries, and tears roll from her eyelashes into her open mouth.</p>
<p>One evening, Lili was standing in the middle of her crying fit when her mother suddenly shouted...</p>
<p>[Gui Ma!]</p>
<p>(The crying stops temporarily.)</p>
<p>[What's the matter, Grandma?]</p>
<p>[Don't let beggars in. Isn't Lili crying?]</p>
<p>[Ah... Go, go, there are no children here... Grandma, the beggar is gone. He said he would catch crying children!]</p>
<p>Seemingly because [the beggar is gone], Lili cries again, and her crying sounds as if she is trying to recover the crying she just lost.</p>
<p>There is a cat meowing in the nearby room, but isn't that the call of a wild cat with scary green eyes!</p>
<p>[Cat, cat,] Lili, frightened, snuggles closer to her mother.</p>
<p>[Hmm, good girl, crying means the cat will come!]</p>
<p>Patting her little shoulders, her mother laughs in her heart.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the wild cat's meow changes its tone and becomes</p>
<p>A sharp roar... and then suddenly falls down...</p>
<p>A suppressed giggle comes from the nearby room.</p>
<p>[Blow, blow, this wild cat is really annoying,] her mother says loudly on purpose. And...</p>
<p>[Lili isn't.]</p>
<p>Lili opens her round little eyes wide.</p>
<p>Tears roll down from her eyelashes, but she smiles slightly.</p>
<h3>Yuan Zhonglang Becomes an Official (Continued)</h3>
<p>— A Ying</p>
<p>For Zhonglang, the [official life] that was incompatible with his mind and body was truly like a monkey in the mountains being tied up and locked in a cage, anxious and dying. He eventually became seriously ill, to the point of [face like smoke, bones like threads, elbows like halberds] (with Wang Wenxi), and had no choice but to prepare a [tomb inscription]. This is truly an interesting matter. He wrote in a letter to Cao Yixin and Wang Baigu...</p>
<p>For several days, I have been dizzy, my eyes are blurred, and I have vomited several pints of blood. I am afraid that I will not be able to get up. I cannot avoid burdening a great writer with a tomb inscription. What can I do? What can I do? At this time, your unworthy one only hopes to return to the mountains and forests and regards repaying Liu as a secondary matter. Alas, with a wise emperor above, although your small official dares not imitate Peng Ze's frowning or drag the tail of the Lacquer Garden, how can he sacrifice his life for officialdom?</p>
<p>Zhonglang was unwilling to [sacrifice his life for officialdom]. He had said in his letter requesting resignation that he had also mentioned this point in a letter to Guan Dongming, saying, [My heart for officialdom is cold and my longing to return is urgent. Although I am foolish, how can I exchange seven feet for an official position?] And he expressed his dissatisfaction with this contemptible [official life], saying, [Why should I lower my eyebrows to serve others, which is the humiliation of cattle and horses and the shame of concubines?] Reading Zhonglang's letters to this point, recalling his joyful situation in the book when he took office and this embarrassing state is truly laughable and pitiful.</p>
<p>In fact, Zhonglang's happiness during his tenure was very short. Soon after taking office, he had the will to leave. At that time, he wrote in a letter, [The bond of a vulgar official binds people so much! I will hang up my hat next year, and this intention has been decided] (with Tu Changqing). From this, it can be imagined that the day he took office was the day he decided to leave. The following year, he truly practiced his decision, and he felt very happy, writing a letter to Bo Xiu, joyfully saying, [Your brother's request for retirement has been decided. Within a few days, he can be a free man, how happy!] How would he know that the facts would be different? He was not allowed to resign, so he wrote an indignant letter to Luo Yingnan, saying...</p>
<p>It is said that being an official is difficult, but it is not known that seeking to leave is even more difficult. Since entering autumn, I have seen that the black gauze hat is like a dustpan, the green robe is like a tattered net, and the horn belt is like an old prisoner's long yoke. Advancing and retreating is embarrassing and pitiful. This statement can be described as humorous and venomous. However, Zhonglang's central indignation is not difficult to imagine. He truly hated the [official life], which had once been his longed-for fairyland. Therefore, when he was allowed to resign, he was as happy as ascending to the ninth heaven. [Visiting West Lake to see flowers and visiting Dao Temple to travel between Heaven's Eye, back and forth between Wu and Yue] (with Zhao Wuxi) was not enough, so he traveled extensively to the southeast to restore his original wild and uninhibited spirit.</p>
<p>Yuan Zhonglang thus served as an official once. The taste of being an official that he experienced was nothing more than this. I have briefly described the entire process of this [nothing more than this] and supplemented it again and again, so readers can always see it. I remember when I was in middle school, I read Zong Chen's [Letter to Liu Yizhang], and I felt that his description of the ugliness of some petty bureaucrats and quasi-bureaucrats who ran around the powerful families was truly vivid and thorough. However, that text only made people feel more disgusted... If Zhonglang's confession, in addition to the hatred of bureaucratic baseness, gives people a kind of wonder. Some officials and adults in modern times are far higher than the [cattle and horses] of that time. Although I am familiar with them, I am ultimately unable to write another [Official Face Spectrum]. The writing of this article is hoped to arouse the interest of a group of great writers who can continue [Officialdom Unveiled] and then come up with a [Revolutionary Officialdom Unveiled]. I will wait and see with anticipation.</p>
<h3>Astonishing Suicide Statistics</h3>
<p>— Bing</p>
<p>The Dark Side of Hollywood Glamour</p>
<p>According to an investigation report by the California police, in 1932, over 120 individuals in Hollywood's film industry committed suicide, averaging one suicide every two days. Among these, approximately 85% were due to financial difficulties, 5% due to heartbreak and marital discord, and 10% due to other unknown reasons. Judging from these statistics, the earlier claim by the famous French drama critic, Loneybo, about the economic crisis in Hollywood is further confirmed. It is shocking that such terrible incidents occur even in the glamorous, luxurious, and flesh-filled world of Hollywood, no wonder the global economy is in a state of panic.</p>
<p>The California police report states that the site with the highest number of film industry suicides in 1932 was the Arroyo Seco Bridge near Hollywood. This bridge, a dry bridge, stands 150 feet above the ground. In one year, 56 film industry figures jumped off the bridge to their deaths. The police department dispatched officers to patrol the bridge to deter suicides, but some still managed to commit suicide there at night. Hence, everyone calls this bridge the "Suicide Bridge."</p>
<p>At the foot of the mountains near the RKO Studios beside the Paramount studio, there's a large electric sign spelling out "Hollywoodland" with thirteen letters. Next to it is a ladder about 50 feet high. In 1932, several movie stars, disappointed and frustrated, climbed up and jumped to their deaths. The first to think of this method of suicide was Beg Entwistle, who was once extremely popular on Broadway but fell into poverty and despair in Hollywood. The "Shen Bao" film supplement detailed her story last year. A few days after Beg's suicide, others followed her method. Later, many more committed suicide there, and the police have now stationed officers there permanently, it is said.</p>
<p>In addition, many committed suicide by taking poison in hotels. For example, ConStance Lygo, who was once prominent on the silver screen, and Alice Pemberton, who was praised as a rare talent in the film industry, both turned to suicide due to unfavorable times and misfortune. Most tragically, Irma Harriman and Genevieve Teritan came to Hollywood together, gained prominence together, and failed together. Their financial situations were equally dire, so they sympathized with each other and committed suicide together by taking poison, leaving a message requesting to be buried together, which is heartbreaking.</p>
<p>Others who used coal gas for suicide included Kitty Coliman. A New York actress, Paul Pern was the only one who used a pistol to commit suicide in Hollywood. The circumstances of Paul's suicide were quite bizarre. Some said Paul sacrificed himself for Jean Harlow, but the California police investigation suggested that it was related to other economic problems. However, the truth remains unknown to outsiders.</p>
<p>Audience Opinions</p>
<h3>Review of "Lingering Spring"</h3>
<p>— Zhu Naitong</p>
<p>This complex and chaotic society, lurking with the greedy desires and selfish psychology of everyone, contains infinite crises. On one hand, it's gentle passion and the revelry of enjoyment, while on the other hand, it's the sorrow of depravity, the pain of disillusionment. "Lingering Spring" portrays a wealthy woman who, because of her wealth and beauty but lacking a correct vision and thorough thought, only knows temporary pleasure and unrestrained indulgence, unaware of the thorns in life's path. Therefore, she triggers landmines everywhere and destroys herself. The story exposes a portion of society's evils. The structure of the entire play shows that it is all her one-sided, fervent pursuit and unrestrained desires that offer temptations of wealth and beauty to others. This tragic outcome is a deserved fact, but a socialite who doesn't value true love ends up sacrificing herself for it, which feels unbelievable and too abrupt a transition. Although it can be said that she urgently repented after experiencing lessons, it doesn't feel sufficient in the writing, which makes the script incomplete.</p>
<p>The director's technique is skilled and clever, such as Mei Li's banquet and Gold Mother's chanting of Buddha, both hinting at her psychological state and the corruption of the family, making a calm scene lively. However, the opening scenes feel too loose, failing to grab the audience's emotions and making it feel dull. The football match is not clearly played, not resembling a heated game. The bathing scene is an old cliché in film art and seems superfluous.</p>
<p>The actors are very dedicated and perform excellently, especially Xu Lai, who fulfills the audience's expectations and leaves a good impression. Her expressions are genuine and appropriate. Without deeper efforts, she will have even greater success in the future. Gong Jianong's performance is also good, a faithful lover is his true character. Zheng Xiaoqiu and Sun Di's performances are natural and lively, adding color to the entire play. In short, this is a good film showing the progress of the Star Film Company. (Chapter missing, reward lacking)</p>
<h3>Impressions After Watching "Lingering Spring"</h3>
<p>— Li Li</p>
<p>After watching "Lingering Spring," I felt that Chinese family education is terrible. Mei Li's extravagance, romance, willfulness, and arrogance are all caused by her parents' doting, especially her mother. In the beginning, when Mei Li feigned illness to avoid studying Chinese, her father questioned her, and her mother said, "What's the point of a girl studying? Does she need to come first in the imperial examinations?" After Mei Li was humiliated by Chai Baichai Qi Shaoping, she went home. Because of the publicity in the newspapers, Mei's father angrily scolded Mei Li, and her mother said, "Our daughter has been wronged, and instead of helping her, you scold her?" From these two points, we can see how Mei Li's mother doted on her and let her do whatever she wanted. The badness of her family education is imaginable. Because of the poor family education, Mei Li didn't study properly and developed all kinds of bad habits. She could return late at night and even not come home. Therefore, I say that Mei Li's tragic outcome -- suicide by poisoning -- was caused by her parents, especially her mother. How important family education is!</p>
<p>"Struggle" Banned, Replaced with "The Adventures of Little Orphan Annie"</p>
<p>The Tianyi Film Company's new sound production "Struggle," directed by Qiu Qixiang and starring Chen Yumei, was originally scheduled to premiere at the Beijing Grand Theater starting from the Mid-Autumn Festival. However, due to certain reasons, the concession authorities could not approve it, believing that it still needed further review. Therefore, today, the Beijing Theater temporarily replaced it with "The Adventures of Little Orphan Annie," directed by Shao Zuiweng and assisted by Yu Dingxun, starring Shao Suxia, Lu Jianfen, and Xiao Zhengzhong. The plot depicts the wandering life of a poor orphan, which is gentle, tragic, and deeply moving. It is an educational film for children with a quite correct ideology, it is said.</p>

<h3>Lingering Spring (4)</h3>
<p>— Yao Su Feng</p>
<p>——On the surface, she also changed her lifestyle for the sake of Shouzhong's advice. In fact, this was not her own realization but merely to capture Shouzhong's love.</p>
<p>Side was utterly disappointed. He had already realized his defeat. Obviously, Mei Li had fallen for Shouzhong.</p>
<p>She knew that Shouzhong already had a wife and that they were very much in love. She was not discouraged at all. She had too much experience—she believed that in love affairs, women always achieve the final victory—and there was also the power of money. She didn't believe that Shouzhong couldn't belong to her. Moreover, Shouzhong had told her that divorce and marriage should be absolutely free!</p>
<p>But Shouzhong never loved her. He had a beloved wife and children, and he also had career aspirations. He and Mei Li were never meant to be together. Mei Li became even more blatant in expressing her feelings to him. In the end, she directly stated her own wishes, hoping that Shouzhong would divorce his wife.</p>
<p>"Didn't you say that divorce and marriage are free?" she said.</p>
<p>"But, freedom cannot be interpreted this way here!" he replied.</p>
<p>Frustration brought her tears, but love still gave her fantasies.</p>
<p>She believed that money could buy everything, and she was almost going to use money to buy Shouzhong. ——She was willing to give money to Shouzhong's wife as alimony—she said to Shouzhong——"I can't leave you no matter what I think."</p>
<p>However, Shouzhong's reply finally disappointed her and brought her tears.</p>
<p>——I cannot sell myself! he said firmly.</p>
<p>Mei Li felt sadness and even talked about committing suicide. Shouzhong sternly said that she should change her path. In this way, you are not only too painful yourself, and</p>
<p>He left in anger. Mei Li's sobbing opened the prelude to the downfall of the weak.</p>
<p>Late at night, Shouzhong received a phone call. When the pleading voice in the phone made its last expectation, Shouzhong resolutely replied with the sentence that he would not agree no matter what. Threats, [death,] the voice in the phone shouted to him, ——truly, sorrowful sobbing, remaining whimpers, and finally destructive silence. By the time Shouzhong rushed over, Mei Li was lying on the floor. The bottle of medicine was thrown aside, and everything was left with a tragic depiction. The remaining gaze still emitted the heat of love——the remaining voice uttered the final farewell——</p>
<p>"Do you promise me?"</p>
<p>Shouzhong shook his head—everything fell into silence. (The End)</p>
<p>an event! It not only directly affects a child [son/daughter]'s life but also indirectly affects society and the nation. But what about Chinese family education? I have nothing more to say. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Review of "Lingering Spring"</h3>
<p>— Qiran</p>
<p>(Above omitted) The performance of the entire play, although very flat, can make people watch for two hours without feeling tired. However, if the director could be less hasty and make a little more effort, I think it would definitely make the audience more interested. It seems that the scenes of Lawyer Wang, Lu Side, and the police rescuing Mei Li in the hotel, and Mei Li "committing suicide" because Shouzhong did not grant her request, were really done extremely sloppily. There are many similar small flaws, which I don't have time to mention again. In short, it's all due to the director's "haste." As for those shots of Mei Li bathing, they really shouldn't be there. I think this is also because the director wants to imitate American films!</p>
<p>Speaking of the actors, Xu Lai performs those romantic behaviors and flirtatiousness very well, but the expression during sadness is not very realistic. This may be due to the lack of life experience and screen experience. However, Ms. Xu is indeed a promising talent. I hope Ms. Xu herself and the directors pay attention. Zheng Xiaoqiu, from "Good Boy" to becoming a gigolo, has made some progress here. Although he still inevitably seems a bit artificial. Gong Jianong is the best, that seasoned performing skill is really rare.</p>
<p>Carlton Shanghai</p>
<p>Simultaneous Screening of "Bai Jinlong"</p>
<p>The long-awaited sound musical film "Bai Jinlong" is a collaboration between Tianyi Film Company and Southern Film Company, directed by Tang Xiaodan and starring Xue Juexian and Tang Xueqing. Xue has the reputation of being the leading figure in Cantonese opera, and Tang is a famous socialite in the south. Their performances are both excellent. The plot tells the story of Bai Jinlong, the young owner of the Bai family hotel, who falls in love with Zhang Yuniang, the daughter of a rubber factory owner in Nanyang. He is deeply in love and endures many hardships, finally leading to the happy union of the two lovers. It is now scheduled to premiere simultaneously at the Carlton and Shanghai cinemas starting from the Mid-Autumn Festival, it is said.</p>
<p>Film Novel</p>
<h3>Struggle (4)</h3>
<p>— Xu Xingzhi</p>
<p>When Genfa led the orphan into Dayi's home, Dayi was carrying his gun and preparing to go to the front line. Genfa was encouraged by Dayi's righteousness, and his heart was filled with the high-spirited emotion of resisting the enemy. He patted Dayi on the shoulder and said, "Dayi, let's go to the front line together!"</p>
<p>Genfa entrusted his son to Dayi's mother to take care of, then picked up his gun and went to the front line.</p>
<p>Amidst the hail of bullets and artillery fire, in the smoky haze of smoke bombs, and under the cover of chattering machine guns, Genfa saw the enemy's plainclothes team attacking the fleeing refugees. Genfa hid among the broken walls and rubble, shot six or seven enemies, and rescued countless refugees. He carried the elderly, disabled refugees and orphans who had lost their parents out of the line of fire. However, he did not expect to discover Geng Dadao, the enemy who had killed his father and wife, among those rescued refugees. Genfa's hatred and remorse intertwined, and he wanted to kill him. Dadao also thought he was going to die and was so scared that he was covered in sweat and turned pale. But Genfa suddenly changed his mind, saying that "the gun to kill enemies should not be used to avenge personal grudges."</p>
<p>So he withdrew the bayonet, abandoned his irreconcilable personal hatred, and continued forward, toward the public enemy of the entire nation. At this moment, he saw his comrade Dayi being hit by enemy bullets, so he ran to rescue him with his gun. As he carried Dayi back home, he discovered that Dayi's mother and his own child had been killed by the enemy. Meanwhile, Dadao, in order to escape, crawled along the front line but accidentally entered a house that was about to collapse. When a shell landed, the house collapsed completely, and Dadao was buried in the debris.</p>
<p>The sound of gunfire became more and more intense, and the enemy attacked head-on with armored vehicles. At the same time, our forces increased more and more. At street corners, wall corners, in alleys, on rooftops, and next to lampposts, our plainclothes teams were densely deployed everywhere. Genfa led a team of worker volunteers, shouting sharply,</p>
<p>"Armored vehicles, brothers, seize them!"</p>
<p>Then "crack, crack" the sound of gunfire erupted, and bayonets flashed with light. Genfa's head was bleeding, and countless bullets pierced his body. Genfa was seriously wounded, but he still shouted, "Throw grenades, brothers!"</p>
<p>While mortally wounded and dying, he was the first to throw a grenade, and the enemy's armored vehicle was blown into pieces. At the same time, along with the destruction of the armored vehicle, our brave and skilled Genfa also died with a victorious smile. (The End)</p>
