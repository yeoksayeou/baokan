<p>（日内瓦）特委會休會後據德代表方凱勒與西代表瑪達利亞加語記者、今晨所修改者、無　足以變更報告書之根本主張、據聞各委員對於報告書首三章、曾逐行細閱、嗣因愛爾蘭代表李斯德要求某項歷史叙述之措辭、應略爲鋒銳、遂於字句上修改五六處、但聞李氏之提議、僅關於歷史部份、未涉建議、（十三日國民電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）十九國委員會現希望於明晨通過所擬報告書中之建議、但據西班牙代表瑪達利亞加今晨語記者、或將再須開會兩次、方能對於報告書獲得最後同意、因此逆科國聯大會或將展至下星期一舉行、亦未可知、（十三日國民電）</p>

<p>（東京）外務省發言人對於外傳日本致國聯覆文之内容、旣不欲徵實之、亦不欲否認之、僅謂文内對國聯之詢問、予以如實的否定答覆、覆文乃依據日内瓦日　代表松圖電東京之草稿擬成、該發言人對於日本是否將因國聯依盟約第十五條第四節提出建議而退出國聯一節、雖不願作答、但曾表示其個人意見、謂日本之退出國聯、可爲豫定的結論云、（十三日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）外務省趕急製作反駁國聯報告書之第十五條第五項之陳述書、聞其最努力主張之點爲如下數項、㈠國聯逸出盟約之範圍、設立特殊機關、日晒政府絶對不認此種獨擅珠措置、㈡邀請美俄等非會員國出席該機關、日政府斷然反對之、㈢此種機關雖告成立、日本不許其干涉關於日本之問題、如美俄兩國欲參加該委員會、則日本將直接對該兩國提出抗議、㈣報告書指日本在滿洲之軍事行動超赿自衛權之範圑、尤屬不當、蓋自衛　之解釋、應完全依於當事國獨自之解釋、第三者濫判自衛之正否、極爲危險、此事美政府亦有表示意見、㈤日本承認［滿洲國］爲推進遠東和平之唯一途徑、故日本斷不能取消此事實、㈥國聯製作如此無責任之空　報告書、因此或將來惹起之國　政局上大紛亂、應由國聯負其責任、（十三日日聯電）</p>

<p>㈠九人起草會主張公平</p>
<p>一年半以來。日本一意孤行。凡事皆以武力爲出發點。兩師圑陸軍。造成九一八事變。襲奪錦州。嚢括北滿。三千海軍陸戰隊。製出一二八血案。砲毁吳淞火焚閘北。今更厚顏强辯。謂熱河爲［滿洲領域。］勢必用兵。且將擾亂濼東。進攻平津矣。其侵略我中國領土。蹂𨈆我中國人民。開古往今來軍國主義侵�</p>
<p>略之新紀錄。而破壤［九國公約］毁棄［非戰條約。］猶其餘事耳。國際聯盟遷就武力。顧全顏面。故自前年迄今。始終秉其和平旨趣。曲意調停。殊不料日本軍閥侵略狂熱。已達極點。於肆其武力刦奪撕碎一切國際公約。背棄國際信義之餘。復時時發露輕蔑國聯之言論。現出挑動世界戰爭之意圖。其尤爲强横無理者。莫如指其軍閥所一手造成之傀儡國爲旣成事實。謂雖［全國化爲焦土亦必保持滿洲。］此種暴烈論調妄目如大阪朝日新聞之社論。亦不能不加以相當非議。吾人試加以公正合理之批判。則謂其爲瘋狂可也。謂其爲全無人性亦可也。世界安有侵略他人之國土。殺戮他國之人民。而猶高倡爲安寗爲和平者乎。况東北三省被侵占以還。滿洲傀儡國民立之後。所謂安寗和平者。僅日人與軍部共鳴之新聞紙上安寗和平焉耳。五個師圑兩個騎兵旅圑一個飛行聯隊并附以其他特種兵力遍駐沿鐵道各地東北民衆（除極少數傀儡之外）人人自危。流亡載道烽烟四起鷄犬不安。乃謂爲和平爲安寗乎。是以李頓調查圑亦各其妄也國際聯盟亦址分懐疑日本之所謂事實也。於是九人起草委員會。乃秉筆直書。十項結論。意甚明顯。吾人於此。除表示相當贊同之外。於九人委員會之能明悉認識。更許爲一年以來公理重張之惟一表徵。</p>
<p>㈡今後我國應有之努力</p>
<p>九人委員會之草案。如獲十九國委員會之贊同。能在國聯大會通過。則我國年來向國聯提訴。即算獲得成果。可謂已盡外交上之能事矣。</p>
<p>然而國際盟。最大限僅屬於道德的裁制機關。殆爲世所共知尤爲我國當局所承認。過去亦曾一再决議。日本軍隊撤退至南滿路沿綫。終以日軍兇暴無能執行。今日之决議。蓋與前日之决議相同。而日本軍國主義者之蠻横。較前且有過之無有及。道德之運用。恐將不能制止武力之暴行。矧榆關旣陷。熱河告警開魯朝陽屢　擊錦州失陷之往事。猶如日。國聯其如之何吾國人又如之何。</p>
<p>或者以爲國際聯盟。旣已實行盟約第十五條第四項之勸告。如不得結果。或將發動第十六條爲經濟的制裁乎。然而吾人須知資本主義各國。雖互相對立。而其對立之惟一因素究在自國之利益。豈能爲他人之［公道正義］而徒然犧牲耶。至於與論之攻擊。不過爲道德上積極助力。又焉能必日本軍閥之就範。况日本帝國主義者已公言其大陸政策。丨丨侵略行爲［保持東亞和平。］何嘗絲毫願及世界輿論所謂之［公理和平］耶。</p>
<p>今日之事。口舌之爭。已屬徒然。且日本調動大兵。集中第六師圑。第八師。第一及第四兩騎兵旅圑。與夫飛行聯隊於錦義及通遼一带。即初年訓練未成之兵。加入前線。佈置就緒。即大舉侵熱。（此已爲日閥主張中日直接交涉以前之行動。）近復發表必須攻占熱河之主張此種軍事行動豈輿論所能裁制。彼又豈畏輿論之裁制。</p>
<p>我國已大難當前。萬分危迫。寗能坐待人之宰割。而不思有以自救耶。現在國際輿論旣已轉而爲吾國之後援。我更當及時奮發。亟起自救。自救之道。厥爲對日爭鬥。而爭鬥不出兩途。第一奮我國廣大羣衆與敵爲經濟的不流血戰爭。然而此已屢試屢敗。終於落空。第二惟有背城血戰。死中求生。以武力抗拒一再無理犯我之武力。然後國際間所主張之公理乃能有力。而我中華民族。乃得更生之道。</p>

<p>軍備方面彼此競　英日好感亦漸减少</p>
<p>日本雖然是一心用武、但是三拳不敵四手、牠自已也知道目前所處的困難局面、如果太平洋覇權不抓在日本手裏、則西太平洋的競爭、持别是在中國市塲的優赿地位、殊不易保持、所以牠今年要添造一萬噸潛水母艦一艘·驅逐艦兩艘·八千五百噸級巡洋艦兩艘、如此、則日本海軍勢力又見增加、僅有一隻一萬噸巡洋艦爲旗艦的美國亞細亞艦隊、真會不值得一擊、</p>
<p>因此、北美合衆國也慄慄危懼、圖謀所以自全之道、第一是令大西洋艦隊長遠留在太平洋以防備萬一、這到不全是意在攻擊、而防守檀香山的意義還多過其他、同時上議院海軍委員會更提出一到一九三六年的海軍建艦計劃］、打算造航空母艦三艘·巡洋艦九艘·驅逐艦八十九艘·潛水艦三十四艘、總計一百三十五艘、三十一萬六千五百三十噸、在如此壞市面當中、竟要拼命補造軍艦、其用意如何、那就盡入皆知了、</p>
<p>可是日本於此并無絲毫反省的意思、并且還更加一層兇暴、例如牠侵略滿洲、外國且不用講、即日本國内的有識者左到共產黨·右到自由主義者·都表充分不滿、然而軍閥還正在拼命顥頇、要把亂事擴大到熱河、延長到平津、甚至於要蔓延到山東、總之一句話是要獨占中國市塲、因此即素常袒日的丨從前是日本同盟國的英吉利、也有點覺得日本太過於横霸、太不通商量了、丨非但要獨自整個兒呑下［滿洲」、并且大有擠迫其他勢力出華北的準備和企圖、所以英國對日好感、似乎漸次减少、國聯也有抑制日本的傾向、</p>
<p>在另一方面、陸地上與日本居於敵對地位、又是日本所借口爲世界敵人的蘇聯、牠對於東北問題、對於日本進攻華北、兼併滿洲、却另具一副如鐵的冷眼、從旁靜觀、可是牠的軍備十分充實、日本確實有幾分對牠戒備、於是今年日本的充實國防的新計劃中、有一部也學蘇聯要練機械兵、不過牠沒有像蘇聯那様設置機械兵師團、牠只是把第十二師團所附屬的第一戰車隊擴充成戰車聯隊、同時把千葉陸軍工兵學校的戰車隊、也擴大成一聯隊、這兩聯隊的擴充費、只今年一年、爲一千一百萬日金、大槪到六月即可完成、同時十九師團動員赴北滿警備、又加一種當前的癌腫、</p>
<p>日蘇衝突、旣然日趨於尖端、可是事情真也凑巧、今年一月間、就有蘇聯的四隻捕鱇船從印度洋駛來、原來是要到［俄荷次克海］去從事於捕鯨事業的、（其中阿留斯號是隻五千噸的老船、作爲母艦、其他三隻各二百六十噸、剛纔在腦威裝起來的）、不知道爲甚麽竟誤閃入小笠原島的二見港軍事要塞地面、於是赤色漁船被捕、</p>
<p>最初、依照東京地方裁判的意見、昌要治牠們以窺探要塞（測量港灣水深伺察形勢）的軍事偵探罪名、後來、司法部以爲這様很不妥當、所以把軍事偵探罪名撤消、但［二見港］不是通商港、所以纔用船舶法治罪、本來打算要沒收那三隻捕鯨船的、可是後來外交部和司法部會商的結果、以爲如果真沒收了這隻船、其價值不過百萬日金、而日本蘇外交關係將加深其裂痕、所以中止沒收其船舶而用以下的罪狀、</p>
<p>㈠小笠原島爲［不開港］、阿留斯不應率領其他三船稱補給飮水與煤炭而入港、</p>
<p>㈡該船長應知當地爲要塞區域、豈得隨意開進、</p>
<p>㈢縱令因航行安全而測度水深可加寛恕、但違反船舶法、則甚爲嚴重、</p>
<p>故三船長各課以一千五百元之罰金、一塲風波、從此告一段落、然而日蘇間的裂痕、日美的對立却愈見嚴重、（二月九日）</p>

<h3 id="c153">中國的病在那裏？ <a href="#c153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>丨丨沈祖光君來信丨</p>
<p>我讀先生答［中國的病在那裏？］一文中：㈠使我最滿意者，是將我文中缺短處，一一指出，使我有所適從。㈡所未滿意者，題目是［中國的病在那裏？］却未說到病源，使我沒有方針。</p>
<p>先生疑似的以爲我是遺老遺少，其實不然；我是社會上一個超然之人。前函所述，實因對於現實的政治太不行，所以提出［君主與民主］一文來討論。因爲聯邦制未實行於中國，不知好壤？共產制亦不適宜於現代，看來止有君主與民主兩途。其實這個問題，屬於政治學範圍，政治無絶對好壤，那就不能禁止他人研究君主與民主。近來我國與論界，不知何故？最忌談君主，一若談君主，卽爲大逆不道者！其實近代文明國家，他的國體，不是君主，便是民主，兩者必居其一。誠如先生說：［卽在經過百數十年革命鬥爭的法蘭西共和國的今日，也還有保皇黨存在］。那麽我們亦不可因爲中國從前是君主，現在改共和了，就不可以研究君主與民主。也不可因爲我是討論君主，就疑心我是與清之幼主有關係。其實中國假定要君主，中國人那一個人不可以做皇帝，而必認賊作父，虚上位以待溥儀來做，這豈不是笑話　　近代的君主國民主國，國民統統有參政權；君主所得到的，不過一點點行政權而已。然行政權還須經議會通過；’此外立法有議會，司法有審判官，君主不過一個虚名而已；與總統制責任在内閣一様。故現代的君主，與從前以神權而極端專制的不同。現在有許多人，都誤會君主是不束縳於人民所定之憲法之下，而有無上之權威者；其實此非近代君主之國家也。民治政體，在現休可謂適宜的政體，然而在現在代議制度之下，已不能如五六十年前之滿足人意。故世界之公法學者，有很多的人研究［文明國家究以何種國體爲最優良］這個問題，此亦想見世界未來的趨勢了。</p>
<p>先生問我［你不先說明國家是什麽，怎様能以說明國家的好壞；不先說明政府是什麽，又怎様能以說明政府的好壞？］我想我們要談事實，不要談理論，故不說國家及政府兩個是什麽東西？今承先生下問，敬舉國家的定義如下：［以一個民族或幾個民族的共同社會，衣食住於固定的領土之上。不受外力所統治，以赴共同的目的；而其間有一種有組織之政府，以其槍能保護全體羣衆，而使之服從的。［這止說出一個道理來，還有數個道理來說。若再進一步，說國家的起原及由來，說國體政體，及統治權，那話就長了。所謂政府，我們當然不指聯邦政府，因中國非聯邦國家也。我們當然不指殖民政府，因中國非準殖民國家也。我們又不指地方政府，因我們對象是在中央也。原來我所說的政府，是對我國目前的政黨政府而言之。其實國家不止一種；有個人主義的國家，又有社會主義的國家，又有共產主義的國家，我們不過抽象而言耳。此其一。</p>
<p>先生說我說：［國之所以立，是由人的，人之所以存在，是要生活的。］錯了！其實人羣之發生，不外生存競爭，現在的政治，將我們生存競爭的條件，統統都剝奪凈盡了，能不呌我們痛哭流涕嗎！我們認爲公共　務關於我們全體利益及行動實在太大了，無論生命財產上，結社集會上，言論出版上，假使沒有好政府，我們就得不到安居樂業！所謂安居，也可將生命財產包括進去講；所謂樂業，也可將結社集會言論出版包括進去講。此其二。</p>
<p>先生問我：［所謂各種制度，究是一些什麽制度？所謂都嘗試遍了，究在什麽地方嘗試過？］在民元之前，民主政治，應用於中國的呼聲甚高，結果改元後、實行民主了；到現在請問民治精神在那裏？此謂之嘗試失敗！民二袁世凱稱帝，欲恢復君主專制，而蔡松坡雲南起事，袁氏沒落。此謂之嘗試失敗！今之中央委員制，襲蘇俄之組織，而失其効能；因爲蘇俄政治組織很嚴密，而其领袖又能集中其權力，運用裕如。而我國却沒有他的技能，弄得上不在天，下不在田，此謂之嘗試失敗！此其三　　先生說：［我們都是打戊午變政，八國聯軍，辛亥革命，洪憲皇帝夢裏這些潮流裏滾過來。］惟其滾過來，滾不出名目來，所以我不滿意！夫太平天國之革命，動機是好的！獨惜人才缺乏，除錢東平石達開幾個人以外统不足道；故沒有成功。義和圑抱扶清滅洋的主義，幼稚得可憐了！所以也沒有結果，及滿清推翻，民國成立，當時中國假使有伊籐博文這様一個人出來維新一下子，算不定中國已好了，無如當時革新人物，意見參商，到孫文臨時總统退位，滿盤新計　，雲時化雲烟！接着便是袁氏稱帝。不瞞先生說，我是始終信仰人材主義的一個人。先生承認［義和園起來反抗帝國主義，給帝國主義者一個當頭棒。］這是我所懐疑的？假使義和園果真以給帝國主義者以當頭棒喝，則八國聯軍，我們中國不致作城下之盟了！須知立國於世界，有兩種要素：一是武力，一是外交；外交與武力，有相互上的關係。如今武力不及人，外交又不及人，不好好的培植人材，而只曉得貼標語曰：打倒帝國主義！結果東三省被人家　去了！求救於國聯，國聯又不援助了！至死還不覺悟前此之非，真無救藥！此其四。</p>
<p>先生說：［一班頭腦冬烘的人，動不動說什麽歷史人情風俗習慣！但我要問歷史是什麽東西？人情是什麽東西？風俗習慣又是什麽東西？［我敬答如下：歷史是公例，又是抽象名詞；其實史的對象，是人是政治是社會變遷沿革的總統計。現今世界各國，那一國的文明史，不本之其自己的進化沿革而叙述呢？此所謂不忘本，風俗也是抽象名詞。不是說：［上之所化爲風，下之所化爲俗。］我的風俗的意義：卽以［、個民族社會所遣傳養成的信仰生活是也。如日本人之席地而坐，印度之之崇拜佛敎，英美人飲食用刀义而不用箸，中國人以前行跪拜禮而今用鞠躬，這都是風俗。人情習慣　也是抽象名詞。所謂人情，可以心理學上的意志作用解釋之；所謂習慣，可以心理學上的練習運動解釋之。例如日本人之佔據東三省，此是日本人的意志；卽見日本人的人情。中國的抵抗日本，此是中國人的意志；亦卽是中國人的人情。又如中國勞動界勤苦耐勞，這是養成的習慣；美洲黑奴的非人生活。亦是養成的習慣。（其不人道當例外講）先生毋謂歷史，人情，風俗，習慣，是陳言。宇宙問赿是大問題，其名詞赿是抽象。明明有個人主義的國家，有社會主義的國家，又有共產主義的國家，而新近有一個政黨，號曰國家主義派，究竟指那種國家主義呢？又如政府當局唱長期抵抗，這亦囫圇呑棗之故了！所謂長期，究竟到何年何月！所謂抵抗，案竟用何種戰略？此都是籠統名詞。籠統名詞，在邏輯上求其合理就夠了，抽象與具體，分析與槪括，似乎無關緊要的。此其五。</p>
<p>先生問我：［究竟怎様豫法？所謂豫者何事］？土耳其之將亡未亡也，有基瑪耳者出，召集國民救國大會，產生救國方法，馬上出兵，打退了駐在土境的各國軍隊，而復與土耳其之國運，這是我所謂［豫則立］者是也。政府屢屢說抗日，而並不抗日，屢屢說準備，而始終沒有準備，這就是我說的［不豫則廢］之意也。其實說决心，說準備，到現在沒有决心，沒有準備，就因爲實際上還是一點沒有豫備，一點沒有辦法之故也。此其六。</p>
<p>總之：我前函所說的，實對於現實的政治太不滿意，還請先生說中國的病在那裏？用什麽藥醫？（　信明日發表）</p>

<p>學校敎育及社會敎育的槪况</p>
<p>就本年一月本市公私立娱樂塲所統計、有如下表、</p>

<p>總　　　　　計一四　一九四　二０七</p>
<p>現在就是普遍的、最重要的二項、［娱樂提出來特别說下說、</p>
<p>㈠關於影　關於電影、因上海爲中國電影事業之中心地、爲外國電影在中國最大之市塲、故電影在本市、對於社會敎育的意義乃更見闳大、本市向有電影檢查委員會之組織、對於電影片均須嚴格檢查、不論中西影片、凡是有害於社會敎良的、或全部禁止、或局部删剪、絶不使其貽害社會、此項工作、行之頗有成效、現在雖已由中央政府统一辦理、但本市當局對於電影片仍奉命隨時嚴密查察、使電影片能在社會敎育上顯出良好的反應、而絶對禁過一切不正當的有害、於社會風化的電影片的放映、我們知道、公共租界工部局也有檢查電影的組織、但我却希望他們要充分與市政府合作、在中央指導之下、取締不良的影片、</p>
<p>㈡關於戲曲唱片同様的、一如對於電影片、市敎育局特有戲曲唱片審查委員會的組織、對於戲曲及唱片負嚴格的審查之責、</p>
<p>此外、一切娱樂塲所、市敎育避均加以相當的注意、對於一切有害的娱樂、均主張嚴格禁止、此項工作、固嫌偏於消極、但同時、在積極方面、亦都有相當的計劃、因爲時間短促、在這裏也不再多說了、</p>
<p>總而言之、在這裏、我所說的、全是就事實來加以說明、本市自市政府成立以來、爲時不多、故一切工作、可以不必諱言、仍在建設的草創時期、雖然我們是積極同前進行、絶不願因陋就簡、但因爲事實上的困難、離開我們所假定的目標、實在還是很遠很遠、幸而計劃已經確定、建設更有决心、我們敢相信、只要經過相當時間、本市的敎育方面的成績當可有更積極的更普遍的表見、</p>
<p>關於本市學校敎育和社會敎育的槪况、大略已經講完、本來我就可以結束我的演講了、不過、現在還是在國難時期、在非常時期、就上海論上海、就敎育論敎育、我們上海敎育界所受日本侵犯淞　的戰爭的影響、至今還是覺得很重大、一切的損失一時不易恢復、我們只要一加檢查上海公私立各學校所報告的戰事損失數、就可明瞭其程度如何了、據市敎育局所得其報告如下、</p>

<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>在這［千穿萬穿，馬屁不穿，］的時代，拍馬屁，過日脚，固然是一　脅　　笑者的拿手好戲；但是！拍馬屁不得其法，應了一句：［拍馬屁拍到馬脚上來的俗語，那便［爲好反成　啊！</p>
<p>誰是爲好反成　？請看波斯一記者。</p>
<p>最近，根據波斯京城電訊：波京可捷希報館記者、爲着波王斥革了待從長官狄穆　希，所以做了一　頌揚波王聖明的文章，極盡其拍馬屁的能事；誰料觸了波王之怒、竟判該記者冒凟尊嚴，犯了大不敬的罪名，罰令在王宮前當清道夫以示薄儆。波王還算文明，不曾把該記者糊裏糊塗的槍斃了；但是，大記者充當清道夫，實行其［斯文掃地］，這也是滑稽之至啊。</p>
<p>丢去了笨桿，去執着這一柄清道的掃帚，一様都是在手腕下運用功去，不過上層工作變做了下層工作，看你還能够［笨尖兒横掃五千人］麽？中國記者是用慣毛筆的居多，當起清道夫來只好執着一柄蘆花掃帚；外國記者不用毛筆而用鋼筆，這位可捷希報館記者，只好執着一柄鐵絲掃帚了！倘逢大掃除的日子，可以聘請他來做指導員！呵呵一</p>
<h3 id="c175">春雪 <a href="#c175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— 湘弟</p>
<p>清晨起來，陡然看見對房子上積着潔白的雪，心裏頗覺奇怪；昨夜並沒有怎様嚴寒，居然也下過雪，并且我怎會一點兒也沒有知道。</p>
<p>廢曆已是元宵，時間總算是挨到春了，自然，昨宵下的雪便是春雪了。據說春雪是比冬雪容易消融些的，事實倒是真的，昨宵積起來的雪，未到正午便消融得一乾二凈了，連些須兒殘痕也幾乎打不到。</p>
<p>春雪雖然沒有冬雪那様富於趣味，但也不是怎様殺風景的東西，冬雪點綴着梅花更有詩意，春雪如果點缀着桃花或、</p>
<p>日本的櫻花，我以爲更會來得有詩意，只可惜在桃花或櫻花剛盛開的春天的二三月，少有下春雪，這倒是真正殺風景的事情。</p>
<p>我記得日本似乎比中國多雪些，我曾見過一二回春雪，而且又恰是在櫻花剛開放的時候，有一次也曾約了幾位歡喜看櫻花的友人到上野神社前看雪後的櫻花，接着玩過了上野公園，又坐電車到飛烏山去看，可惜我不會做詩，結果，雖有詩情，却未曾成一首詩；只有一位日本女同學是會吟俳句的，倒成了一首很清麗的俳句。這些韻事，到現在回憶起來，真像輕夢，飄飄浮浮的消失去了。</p>
<p>在中國，尤其是在繁華而且　俗不堪的都市丨上海連桃花也少看見，就是在二三月間下雪也沒有用，索性不下來得痛快些，詩意，在這裏是永不會有的，我想。</p>

<p>— 鵑雲</p>
<p>我不能健忘，［大連］是我們中國的土地，被日本强權霸據的一部份；是日本野心家滿蒙侵略主義發動的策源地！一點也不欺人，已經都成了日本統治下的順民。凡是住在大連的人，再也想不到［大連］是以前中國的領土！失勢的軍閥，包辦日貨的奸商，一旦在中國内地立脚不住的人，再比那們好的法子也沒有，上大連一走。</p>
<p>［亡命與漢奸］大連便是這一班人的庇蔭地。有錢的中國人，看着國内紛亂，出洋上外國，似乎太費些事，不妨在大連買一所房子，做一個逍遙法外的［大連寓公］！</p>
<p>我到大連一共是四次，前三次都是從天津趁唐山丸回靑島，路過大連。要躭搁兩天光景。</p>
<p>最近一次，去年七月二十病後在北平伏養了三星期。自己决定着繞大連上一趟哈爾濱。至少我的工作，也可以觀察觀察滿洲僞國沿途的秘密。</p>
<p>這一次到大連，已不似從前那們自由。上了碼頭簽姓名，並且要註出到何處去，有何公幹的詳細理由書。</p>
<p>實在爲難，雖則我很有不少伏居在滿洲僞國之下的朋友，但是目的和公幹，速我自己也不曾定奪呢。我爲了敷衍手續的原故，不能不舉出住在大連的Ｘ先生。</p>
<p>×先生招待我十分　慇，久别重逢格外顯得客氣了。我們在密談之中，便說到滿洲僞國的事。</p>
<p>實在喪心病狂！中國人竟有带錢到滿洲去投資的丨同時我很能想起在去年一二八滬變時，竟有主張擴充對日本貿易的人！</p>
<p>危險和障礙，我在大連盤桓了三天的結果，×先生極力阻止了我的哈爾濱之行。</p>

<p>— 郭蘭韾</p>
<p>在雨雪紛飛中，真好像看見東北的難民，在啼饑號寒着。我同錦餘爲了盡救濟東北同胞的一點心願承銷了幾張劵的關係，也突破了雨雪去參加，去的時光是五點半，雨雪　　的辣斐德路上，别有一番情味。</p>
<p>到逸園門外，見黨國旗好像含淚的掛着，我們進去，看見汽車像愽覧會様陳列着，知道參加的人很多了。同時也看出了參加的有不少是資產階級，應該捐幾個錢，同時也能夠出錢來救國救同胞的。</p>
<p>我們上了樓，同時還有許多人在繼續着前來，但抱憾的已經客滿了，我們更上一層樓去觀，向下邊舞廳裏展望，坐滿着許多黨國要人，在野名流；社會聞人的太太小姐與明星舞女們，衣香鬚形，珠光寶氣，沒有難的影子，有的是爭妍鬭麗，炫惑誇耀的表現。</p>
<p>我獨自想起，假使在塲的太太小姐明星們的裝飾品，能夠捐助的話，價值的代價不知要超過入塲劵資幾百倍，東北難民受惠必多，但這不過是我的獨想罷了，事實上决不會實現的。</p>
<p>因爲沒有座位，我們在約巡禮了一周，看見了不少新奇瑰麗的時裝，那些衣料都是西洋貨，同時我覺得這次參加的女性燙髮，粉，胭脂，口紅，香水的代價，也抵夠入塲劵資全數若干分之幾吧？漪歟盛哉１</p>
<p>最後我們在留停五分鐘後，就開始退出，華爾慈舞的音樂送我們，歡娱，擁抱，狂舞，難民，鐵血，亡國的幻影，好像交錯着打轉，我們也無心留着，就奪出了玻璃門跳上車兒歸來，同時一輛輛汽車還挾了一羣羣人進門。雨雪這時飛揚起來，像絶望的流淚。</p>

<p>— 火雪明</p>
<p>浜水很闊，很明凈，見不到底，只是一片深遠的澄監，一層流汞似的融漾的月色，但混江龍的經騐並不因此會失敗，他能夠找尋毫無痕迹的［魚巢］。不久，在水花特别轉旋的一株枯樹，影子斜照的波上，他得到了無窮的希冀，野火一様的欲念抬起頭來，便重復撩撥着蘆花的脆枝，習慣地跳到這邊來。把外裏的棉襖，很快地卸去了。</p>
<p>大約不到一霎眼瞬間，他雙脚挺起，挪着魚叉，做個姿勢，像松鼠一様，用足氣力，眼看得親切；縱身入水去了。</p>
<p>龐大的水聲跳起，大榆樹上的宿鴉驚得飛鳴四散，遠近村莊上又一齊傳來了犬吠的狂響，蘆花也　　······的似乎在歎息。不用說浜面上就立刻盤旋了圖案似的花紋，像摀碎了一面純白的水晶鏡子般的月色。</p>
<p>這裏，混江龍手裏緊揑着的魚叉，已深深地剌進了浜底，他全身也被水冷的水淹沒了。他這多角的魚叉，照例便找得三五尾鯽或黑魚·用力的代價是决不會太差的，他很了然。於是，他在水底用兩手把握住魚叉的柄，猛力拔起來，重得很，一定是大魚。他想：照例可以順手一尾一尾，藏進魚簏去。這時候，凌家浜四遭的空氣，又歸於沉寂而且寒凍。</p>
<p>［怎麽？］混江龍開始在水底發也這様一聲驚奇的慘呌。水面上寂然。他馬上冒出水來，向岸上努力一跳，睜開眼瞧，魚叉尖端上嚇然掛着一顆鮮血淋漓的小孩子的首級。這首級，在月光下，看得出是屬於自己新生的嬰孩的。（三）</p>

<p>××老師：</p>
<p>祗爲我到處飄泊，行踪無定，就連個通信地址，也不能告訴你，自然希望得到你的回信，再事實上是萬不會有的。不過以前我寄給你的兩封信，想來不致被郵局失落吧？</p>
<p>老師！我現在想想一個人的幸運是不可强求的。承老師和師母的恩惠，提携我踏進了社會之門，我是極想竭我所能，烈烈轟轟的幹出些事業來；一則可以報答慈母養育的艱辛，二則也可不負老師們的期望。但是光陰像閃電般的過去，不特起禄的願望都成了泡影，恐怕將來還會有不能和你們見面的危險呢！我現在想着，真說不出的難受！把諸位的一番盛意，完全付之流水，赿想赿痛心，赿想赿懊惱！現在我的神經已受着極猛烈的激剌，假使我沒有慈母存在，我早就殺了！</p>
<p>老師，你不要以爲我現在是在作無病之呻，想想來真有許多的事對不起諸位呢！·····························</p>
<p>這是Ｓ先生一個很得意的女學生，從　埠寄給他的一封信，他看了覺得很不快活，想伊家裏只有一個老母，兩個胞姊，並且兩個胞姊都是做了未亡人了，還染了嗜好，一門之内，旣無伯叔，尤鮮兄弟，一切生活等費，完全要靠這個年不滿二十歲的弱女子，要去和這個吃人似的惡社會裏奮門，爭生存，這是一件極端可憐的事。但是看伊信上的語意，又似乎含着有一種不可告人的隱情在裏頭，真使他有萬分的疑慮。</p>
<p>在八年前的一個廢歷新年，在××路的××里，有一家單隔廂石庫門房屋的廂房裏，擱上一扇板門，板門上躺着一個屍首，用了條半新半舊的印花綢夾被，從頭至末蓋着，實在分不出是男是女，不過屍身腹部隆起，有些異様罷了。旁邊有一個頭髮已經花白的老婦人，還有兩個中年的女子哭泣着，手裏都摺着紙錠，景象十分的悽切。隔了一會，忽聴得墻門響處，走進幾個人來，先進來的是一個中年男子，穿着很挺刮的洋裝，態度十分靜肅，後面跟隨着三個女子，打扮也都很整潔。一個二十開外圓圓的面孔，長長的身段，容貎很嬌艷；一個三十左右的，生得也不差；一個年紀稍大，肥肥的身材，血色甚好，他們一路進來，那廂房裏的兩個女子，見了含着淚，連忙放去了手裏摺的紙錠，緊幾步迎了出來，那個年老的婦人，也上前來打着招呼，等他們走到了擱屍首的板門旁邊，就用起手來輕輕掀去了盖在屍首上面的夾被的一端。露出了一個用髮滿頭面黄如蠟的一個年靑女屍。</p>

<p>— 沙駝</p>
<p>雖近春天，窗外仍是風和雪。　　我坐在樓頭，四圍冷落地沒有一點聲息，想着山中正月頭的情景；照例，這幾央正在拔龍登。</p>
<p>在山頭，拔龍燈不是輕易的玩意兒　，不要說每年祗有這一次，而且這也是山頭精壯後生的唯一户外競技，城裏有五月的鬭龍舟，山上可沒有。</p>
<p>自元宵前一天直至十七，遠近的人穿着簇新的春衣，趕來拔龍的鎭上。任是從什麽遠地來，也無須乎顧慮食宿問題，有親戚的自然到親戚家拜年，即使是沒有親戚的生客或過路人，也會被人笑着臉接去。在這四天，鎭上每户都有供給食住的義務，這東道做得愈大愈佳。　　吃過晚飯，快要上燈時，街上早已塞滿人，老的靠在椅上，小的跳着，少女埀辮子，羞怯地躱避生客的眼光。不管是晴雨，不管是冷暖，總是一様地高興。如其碧天似洗，圓月當頭，那自然更妙，燈光人影之外，再加月色如水，大家愈加熱狂了。</p>

<p>中國民權保障同盟，在北平成立了分會，爲營救許多因抗日及反帝而被捕的學生之類，曾費了不少的氣力。北平市黨部，因而有誣爲非法圑體的建議。</p>
<p>法，種類似乎很多很多。上海附近常有人出賣富陽法，中國全國又有人人會變的戲法，三娘敎子裏頭還有一根打小孩的竹棒呌作家法，這些法，倒是我們所習見的東西。至於法治精神的法，立法司法的法，我們却只在各種委員的名稱上，衙門的招牌上，以及報紙的命令上看見過。真正的法律的化身，正義的公判，是非的决斷，在中國的社會上，政治上，好像是不大遇得到的様子。外國我畫的法律的女神，是眼睛上包着一塊布，手裏頭拿着一具天平秤的。我想在中國若要畫出這女神來，也可以全抄這幅外國的畫，不過要再在也手裏的秤盤之上，加上些槍杆子或用金子打成的法碼之類就對。</p>
<p>最近中國民權保障同盟會所竭力反對和援助的幾件案件，是大家所曉得的：㈠鎭江新聞記者劉煜生的被害事件，㈡因反抗日帝國主義者來侵而被捕的學生工人事件，㈢爲爭政治上的言論出版集會結社游行等的自由而遭拘禁的政治犯事件，等等。我們要决定該同盟的是非法或非非法，還須先問一問牠所反對的事情是非法或非非法纔對。</p>
<p>所以我們要問：劉煜生的被害是非法的不是？滿洲國是不是我們大家應該承認擁護的合法組織？言論出版等自由，在法律上應不應該給予人民的？</p>
<p>中國到了目下這一個危機四伏的時期，大家應該醒醒了，儘躱在門角落裏撒爛汚，難道真的就不怕天明的曙光到來麽？</p>

<p>— 李聖悅</p>
<p>大槪是中國皇帝太怕蹺辮子的緣故吧，一向就歡喜臣民稱他們爲［萬歲］，萬歳二字成了歷朝大子的專稱，正如　］字成了天子獨占的Ｆｉｒｓｌｐｅｌｓｏｎ一様。　　其實［萬歳在最初並不一定是皇帝的尊稱。盾過韓非子的人大槪總記得［萬歳］原不過是巫覡者的一種祝詞。［萬歳］之成爲天子的尊稱，恐怕是始於漢代。當　憲大將軍威震天下的時候，長安的一班官兒對他伏地稱［萬歳］，有一個草包名呌韓稜的面紅耳赤地提出抗議說；［爲人臣者可以［萬歳］相稱嗎？］可見那時萬歲不是隨便何以喊的。</p>
<p>我常感覺到［萬歲］和皇帝怕死的心理</p>
<p>是絶頂矛盾的，因爲這兩字一出口就是咒咀皇帝活到一萬歳還不免蹺辮子（崩　），正如恭祝平民之子一長命百歲］是一様含有惡意的咒咀的。平民的狗命不值錢，活一百歲還自以爲長壽，比起天子的萬歲來，誠然有如不知春秋的蟪蛄或蜉蝣，然而在無盡頭的時間之洪流中，一萬歲之於百歲只不過是百步與五十步之比罷了，因爲遲早大家總歸一様是死的呀丨</p>
<p>現在是民國時代了，宣統皇帝的［辮子主權］早已蹺辮子了。聰明的人於是依據［中學爲體，西學爲用］的原則，從外國文重新翻譯出［萬歲］兩字來到處應用，人們非但不覺得這兩字封建得討厭，慱而以爲新鮮時髦了。這大槪可以與翻舊爲新的［革命］兩字先後輝映吧。可是萬歲的究極總有點陰森森的味兒。</p>
<p>西洋洋毛子畢竟比我們聰明得多了，他們不用有限的數目字來作爲恭祝詞，所以一點不覺得有一最後還是死［的味道。譬如英國人喊ＬｏｎｇＩｉｖｅｔｈｅＫｉｎｇｌ（皇上萬歳）。法國人喊ＶｉｖｅＩａＲｅｐｕｂｌｉｑｕｅｌ（共和萬歲）。德國保皇黨起勁地呌ＥｓｌｅｂｅｄｅｒＫｏｎｉｇｌ（德皇萬歲）。蘇聯工人狂熱地呌ＤａＺｄｒｅｖｓｌｅｕｅｔＰｌｏｌｅｌｅｒｓｋａｙａＲｏｖｏｉｕｃｈｉｙａ（普羅革命萬歲）。照Ｌｏｎｇｌｉｖｅｖｉｖｅ等字的原義說，都是祝賀什麽什麽活着或長久地活着。比中國的什麽什麽萬歲喊起來，不感覺到到髮怵然。所以萬歲兩字譯得工雖工，但未免有點上古人之當了，於此亦可見翻譯之難矣丨</p>
<p>東洋矮子比我們更不如，像鸚鵡學舌一様，將中國的國粹［萬歲］二安偷了去，閉起嘴巴來將Ｗａｎｓａｉ學成了濁音的Ｂａｎｚａｉｏ去年有上千木　兒在虹口揮着太陽旗對新到上海的東洋援兵高喊Ｂａｎｚａｉｌｌｅｎｎｏｂａｎａｉ（天皇萬歲），至今思之，猶令吾人浩嘆矮子之不足敎。但此輩矮子不但自己瘟頭瘟腦地喊着天皇萬歲，現在還在發瘋似的强迫别人跟着他們狂吠，去年不是有于冲漢謝介石等等有名的漢奸率令一群［滿洲國］美女美男向Ｔｏｋｖｏ進發，狂呼ＦｅｎｎｏＢａｎｚｎｉ嗎？我不知道漢奸們對宣統小子又將稱呼什麽，假使復辟成功的話，大槪至多也祇能給他一聲肉麻的千歲吧。</p>
<p>最後讓我把話拉回頭來，我個人雖然覺得［萬歲］有點不吉利，但在沒有適當的字眼翻譯Ｌｏｎｇｌｉｖｅ······一類的字以前，我們權且沿用了［萬歲］二字吧。只是我們不希望以蒼生之骨殖來做寳座的人萬歳；而希望並禱祝代表正義與真理的制度和思想萬歲丨萬萬歲，以至無窮。讓［萬歲］兩字也跟着萬歲下去吧：［萬歲］萬歲！</p>

<h3 id="c229">中國不亡 <a href="#c229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— 吾</p>
<p>近來常有人論斷：中國必至於亡，就是在我看來，也覺得是滿有可能的。這當然是指亡於某種大人物的磕頭打躬之中而言，决不至於無疾而終。然而這幾天我却有點疑惑起來；我覺得中國或許不至於亡，也說不一定。不是連滿洲皇帝的弟媳也居然愛國起來了麽？</p>
<p>據報載：傀儡溥儀弟婦溥唐石霞願與其夫溥傑破鏡重圓，原因是：［自其（傑）負笈扶桑，數年以來，霞困守北平，閹僕惡奴，肆意挑撥。家翁聽信讒言，時有聞言，此霞不能自安者。］而且［溥儀爲日人挾之東去，事前曾向家翁泣禀力諫，而家翁反斥霞爲多事，］於是這一深明大義的女英雄，便［不得不隻身出府，寗願爲華夏之孤魂，弗甘作僞帝之親贵并，故赴長春實不可能］。然而也不是完全沒有轉灣的餘地，如後說：［外子如顧結髮之情，來滬就霞，霞當爲之奔走當道，尚不難有其立足之處。否則一时失敗，同行身敗名裂，遺後世之唾駡，國内外將永無立錐之地。］</p>
<p>照這篇大道理看來，好之不去東北，當然是［寗願做華夏之孤魂，弗甘作僞帝之親貴，］母容說；此女可風，只就這兩句話，我們也值得替她樹石牌坊以揚仁風於萬古千秋，何况當溥儀東去之時，她還曾泣禀力諫，所以更是可歌可泣。加之數年來困守北平的苦雨凄風，此情此景，也就可想而知了。然而到底還有結髮之情，如伊人倘能來滬就伊，仍不惜爲之奔走當道，這一節，當然不會吹牛，以處情理之當道諸公，自不難爲之轉灣設法。是以旣愛國，又圑圓，天下之美事，當莫過於此者。但是，據我們他細想來，所謂［遺後世之睡駡］一層，唐女士可不必多慮，後世的事，誰管得着，而且這與［流芳千古］有着同様的功效，還不是同様爲人們所詠頌？而且僞帝之親貴，到底不可多得，人生能有幾何，個中滋味，何不飽嘗一番呢。</p>
<p>然而說來說去，中國的國基，究竟還是可靠，因爲連我們的帝王親貴也居然愛國起來的原故。</p>

<p>— 冰清女士</p>
<p>在那日雨後的一個下午，導領首我家新僱的僕人，往我母校去，領我的弟弟，</p>
<p>我默然的，拖着一雙笨重的破棉靴，低頭望着泥濘的街道，揀捎乾的地方下脚，我的心中，只感到這靴是太重笨了，</p>
<p>一轉灣，已看見遠遠的那座壯嚴而崔巍的母校，我就回顧頭去，瞅着伊說，［見了嗎？］［那就是，］</p>
<p>時候尚早，還有三十分鐘才放學，我不耐煩等着，我只領伊到弟弟的敎室前去，叮囑伊［路上當心］的話，我就匆匆的走了，在經過中高級組敎員室的門口，我就鬼鬼祟祟的，走了近去，向窗内窺探，我雖不是找蔣老師［從前的級任先生）談話，可是極希望見見伊的尊容，我覺得蔣老師的一種嚴謹安祥的態度，是誰也不能及的，</p>
<p>在那靠窗的一排，最末一個坐位的窗口，透進半明半暗的光線，牠似乎不願照到别位先生，只照在一位穿着黑衣的女先生的肩頭上，這位光明磊落的先生，不是蔣老師又是誰呢？我不願進去打斷伊，正在打起精神，熱心地在改學生卷子，的這個寳貴時間，</p>
<p>我在這窗外的一瞥中，我的心田裏，湧上了說不出的甜酸苦辣的味兒來，我似乎要笑，似乎要哭，這難言難　的一刹那，豈是我粗通筆墨的人，以描寫得出的，</p>
<p>我只覺得我沒福，不能消受這慈母般老師的訓導，我在這一瞥中，似乎見了一位世界的大偉人，在我出來時，我只感覺到榮幸快樂，</p>

<p>我們已是三四年的朋友，現在進而爲夫婦，理應雙方面的性情，志趣，都已熟識。同居之後，一如你說，一室之中，樂也融融。但是一件意料不到的悲劇？打破了我的美麗的夢境丨我的妻子，已傷失了處女之誇。老友，你不要笑我迂腐。在這個半年頭兒講處女不處女，似乎太落伍了。不過在某種情形之下，處女倒底還是處女。我們旣已有三四年的友誼，在三四年的過程之中，戀爱是坦白的進行，本來在戀愛的狀態下，不應有隱瞞欺騙的意識參入其間。我的妻子三四年中熱烈的愛着我，我也愛着他，但她沒有把這件事告訴我，待我發現了之後，還百般的推諉，顯然她想把這莫須有的責任御到我的肩上。老友，不</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>是說風凉話，如其她早說明，我也不會就此把我們三四年建築的愛情，功虧一仭。戀愛應該坦白，她給我的失望太大了丨自從爲這事爭執之後，蜜月中情趣，像氷一般的冷，以後能否恢復一室之中，樂也融融的祝詞，至少參入一些苦笑的成份。戀愛是坦白的，朋友我根據這一點處女不處女問題，就在這種情形之下而發后了。</p>
<p>現在且丢開我們的私事，進一步講，貞操是男女雙方丨無論在道德，戀愛，平均負保守的責任。在我將近三十的生命史上，我並沒有損失我的貞操：我是一個男子（恕我說了一句統傳觀念的話）比較容易傷失貞操的環境中，却並不自棄的破壤，女子反輕易的出賣貞操，言之痛心丨再進一步講，男女被略誘脅逼而傷失貞操，法律有相當的保護權。但在戀愛的過程中，應坦白的。</p>
<p>現在我竭力想不把這件事骨梗在我們夫婦之間。春已經來了，你有興的話，到這里山中來玩幾天，能與尊夫人同來更佳。多幾個作伴游山，可使滿山之中，樂也融融吧。</p>

<p>— 警吾</p>
<p>老友程君，自從它服務首都以來，已有兩年不見面了！新近它因有事還鄕，突於前天翩然惠顧。因爲睽隔多時之故，不免治具欵留，聊盡東道主人的微意。飮酒旣酣，彼此縱論時事，漸且及於異聞，用佐清興。</p>
<p>我爰舉舊歲本刋揭載之［鼠報讐］一文爲言，以其事絶稀奇，足當異聞二字咧！</p>
<p>它說：［說起一鼠報讐］，我也想着關於鼠的一　故事：而其稀奇程度，實超［鼠報讐］而過之！三來［鼠報讐］這篇文章，我當時也曾寓目以爲無非作者寓言諷世，藉以激勵國人，而勸來者！那裏曉得過不幾日，就有［鼠窟藏囚］的新聞，發現於我新都逆旅的鄰家·而爲我所目擊。然則天下的事情，不能因了目所未見，而遂肯定他的必無呢！在我旅次的間壁，開着一家南貨而兼肉舗的商號。去年肉舗的錢櫃，爲了一足損壤，雇人修理，纔一移動，　見地上泥土墳起，像蟻封，旁有一穴如碗口，窺之甚黝黑，探以竹竿，即聞有聲吱吱然，發穴覘之，則一巨鼠肥健無倫，目光灼灼，見人毫不畏懼，昂頭擺尾，植立弗動。細加審視，才知他的四足牢釘在木片上，一得動彈。衆人覩狀，始悟此鼠之所自來，原來在半載以前，南貨舗中的Ｘ夥友，嘗捕獲一鼠，以其碩大無朋，戲以木片將其四足釘住，製成標本模様，置諸櫃上，以爲笑樂。不料赿宿遽失所在，以爲無疑地已果貓腹了！誰知竟會給牠同類救去，潛藏穴中，且作長期的供養，俾延生命，至於歷久而無恙。這様看來，他不唯對於異類，富於報復性，就是對於同類，也富於愛護性哩！］</p>
<p>聽了它這一席話，不禁使我發生感觸。似茲蕞爾什麽，居然唯知同類是愛，不恤犯其艱險，竭力援拯丨以視一般軍閥，或受賊憑陵，不起抵抗，或操戈同室，自相摧殘；把東北淪陷的同胞，和抗敵的義軍，轉置於不聞不問之列！坐使虜騎長驅，榆關失守！警傳風鶴，震及平津！若而人者，與鼠相衡，能母自慚弗逮？</p>
<p>嗚呼！人不鼠若，曷以人爲？</p>

<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>上月我家裏來了一個同鄕朋友，他背後還跟着一個大腹便便的靑年婦人；當時我還以爲這一定他的新夫人了。所以向他一恭到地，一方埋怨他不該不請我吃喜酒，一方還恭賀他兩人合作的成績丨大腹便便。不料我的朋友，竟哭着臉，只是搖頭嘆息；弄得我丈二和尚，摸不着頭起來了；後來他才細細地告訴我。原來這靑年婦人，從小與敝友是鄰居；前年她嫁給另一個男子爲妻。因爲她丈夫終年在外，所以與敝友鈎搭上手：不料種下禍胎，在本鄕不能存身。他們這次來申的原意，是想在上海找些工作做的，不料一月來營謀的結果，還是毫無辦法。至於我呢，暫時招呼他們個把月，當然不生問題；日子久了，也覺難乎爲繼。他們明知我不能一輩子照顧他們，所以想在下列二條路裏，擇一而行。</p>
<p>㈠毅然返鄕丨但本夫已呈請法院，懸賞緝拿；飛蛾撲火，情實難堪。</p>
<p>㈡各自分飛丨敝友當然還有辦法，該婦勢必自尋短見；始亂終棄，天良不安。</p>
<p>先生：究竟在這兩條路之外，有沒有更好的辦法？倘使沒有，那末那一條好呢？請你救救他們罷丨祝你</p>
<p>健康　陳其康謹上</p>
<p>編者按：新刑法規定［有夫之婦與人通姦者，處二年以下有期徒刑，其相姦者亦同］。是陳君的朋友和這婦人，當然可以說一聲罪有應得；我們决不能代他想什麽法子。但是反轉來一想，靑年婦人，關在家裏守活寡，因性的煩悶而逾赿範圍；實在是很可憐的。［春色惱人關不住，一枝紅杏出墻來］；這句話真不錯呀丨</p>
<p>我們以爲陳君的朋友，無論如何不應該遺棄這婦人；因爲非但這是不道的的事，而且萬一真的自尋短見起來，法律上的責任，也就要比單純的誘罪，加重六七倍呢。陳君能勉力多留他們幾天，代他們設法設法，使他們能苦苦惱惱的獨立謀生，這是上策。萬一弄到後來，竟一籌莫展，那末只得挺而走險，毅然返里。好在這種官司，至多也不過兩年；萬一法官大老爺用情格外，只判上兩個月，也難說的。</p>

<p>— 汪仲賢</p>
<p>（十）愛她就是簡接愛你</p>
<p>仲南盤問了幼中一番，生了許多狐疑，幼中去後，房裏只有一個黛秋，仲南又向她轉灣抹角的盤詰，黛秋也是守口如瓶，不肯吐露她娘的醜行，伸南知道軟說無效，忽將眼睛一瞪，滿面露着殺氣，鼻子一哼，說道：</p>
<p>［我早已打聽明白了，你的娘一到上海，就軋姘頭，你還替她隱瞞些甚麽？我所不知道的，就是她的姘頭究竟姓甚名誰，你帮着她隱瞞，大槪你也是與她通同一氣的！］</p>
<p>仲南雖不是大聲呵斥，但他說話的神氣很是嚴厲，看了有些怕人，黛秋本就含着一肚子委曲無從申訴，恨不得將滿腹牢騷盡情發洩，一句話提到了喉　口，幾次和唾沬咽了下去，始終沒有勇氣說出來，如今看見了這副晚爺面孔、逼得她沒有法子，只好········只好擠出幾點眼淚來，付之一哭！</p>
<p>。女人逢到了危急之事，便會請出眼淚來救駕，尤其是對付男人，無論什麽天大的事，只要眼淚出塲，便把一切難解决的問題都解决了，</p>
<p>黛秋去後，仲南又向使女們查問，結果也是不得要領，放晚學的時候到了，茂生背了一個書包回來，照例要到仲南面前來掛一個號，才能領了點心錢到裁缝舗裏去游玩，仲南將使女們都打發開了，留着茂生在身傍，用刑名師爺誘供的方法，漸漸的由淺入深，一步步地趕緊，騙他說出若華的情人來，其實茂生是一個很直爽的孩子，即使老實問他，他也會直截痛快的說出來，他在裁缝舖子裏，天天也拿若華與幼中的軼事豔聞來做談話資料，藉此可以騙五香豆吃，如今看見父親也愛聽這新聞，他更形得意，一張嘴好像黄河决了口一様，把娘與阿叔的醜狀；形容得淋漓盡緻，說一個滔滔不絶，仲南怕打斷他的話頭，含着笑容聽他指手劃脚的演講。心裏却又酸又痛，說不出的難過。</p>
<p>仲南得到了確實消息，給了茂生四角錢的獎勵金，將他打發走了，立刻傳老胡進來，命他去請五老爺來談話，老胡去了回来，說五老爺不在家中，無處尋找，這一夜，若華玩到深宵方歸，仲南怕家醜外揚，耐足了氣，守她晚裝完畢，使女們都去睡了，才把若華喚近身來，伸出那隻未瘋癱的手，先給她一個巴掌，才後咬着牙駡了了她一頓，若華起初想强辯，經仲南提出了幾個茂生供給他的證據，她才俯首無言。</p>
<p>仲南警告她道：［明天，我要把我的老弟兄和親友都請到家裏來，宣佈你和糼中的罪狀，然後登報與他斷絶兄弟往來，與你脫離夫妻關係。我們姓夏的是世代相傳的詩禮人家，從未出過這種亂倫的禽獸，我爲維持我家的禮敎，要把這离獸驅逐出族，並要禀請官廳，驅逐你們這一對奸夫淫婦出境，永遠不准你們再來，免得有傷地方上的良善風化！］</p>

<p>— 羅拔高</p>
<p>［慾潮］，這部德國烏發公司出品的所以不平凡，是有多方面的成因的。良好的劇材，高明的導演，攝影的美妙，用光的調和，編製的得宜，剪接的經濟等···在表演的成功之外，當然却有莫大的力量。</p>
<p>這位世界大演員依密爾雅寧斯，原是我們銀幕上的熟人，自一九二六年以至如今，和我們已見了不少回面。他第一次和我們見面是在未曾翻造以前的上海大戲院，他所主演的影戲是［風流女伶。］雅寧斯在那　戲裏的内心表演，使他的肌肉都全部起了緊張，眼神經尤其來得有力量，聰明的導演呌他整個兒在沉着，自然，深刻，狠辣的裏面表演出來，成了他那［新硎初試］的傑作。</p>
<p>雅寧斯的第二次作品是一齣祇有兩幅字幕的［最後之笑］，在卡爾登映過。一劇的本事完全是在他的表演上啓示出來，絲毫不假借字幕底說明而能夠使觀衆全部了解。聽說那兩幅字幕還是以了美國才加上的。於此可以知道雅寧斯表演的驚人。這真是一個世界影壇的偉大紀念！他在［最後之笑］裏幾乎是演着獨脚戲，每一個塲面都有他的動作和表情，但每一個塲面都看不到他的表演有一點鬆懈，</p>
<p>他演了［最後之笑］之後，不給美國的派拉蒙影片公司莫名聘去。他在派拉蒙一共演了影片五張，是［肉體之道］，［罪惡之術］，［最後命令］，［愛國男兒］等。（未完）</p>

<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>丨卡爾登開映丨</p>
<p>每一個國家的政治現象，常會有意識的反映新藝術作品中來，這是很可以找着許多例證的。即如本片便是蔣美國的禁酒後的社會現狀，丨特别是上層社會的紳士太太們對於這一法令的陽奉陰違，有力的而幽默的曝露出，同時將他們或她們的醇酒美人的瘋狂狀態附带的描寫，揭穿他們是在怎様的享樂，怎様的對於自己的兒女漠不關心，以爲兒女在以金錢僱用來的看護的奉待之下，當然是生活優美，於是便以牛乳洗浴亦不爲奇，而且，富貴家庭中的奴僕的奸險，陰謀，亦有所說及。</p>
<p>在這様的一個主題之下，編劇者很能運用輕描淡寫的手腕充分的發揮出來，雖然有些地方略有失之嚴密，但是全篇便是一部喜劇結構，所以旣不如何緊凑，亦不如何鬆懈，只是一幅生動的素描。</p>
<p>當然，導演在這一片中努力不少，有好些地方可見其聰明的流露。諸如骷髏和看護同床，雖然是個笑料，但是却可見其巧妙，即是當看護長進來的時候，我們都疑心她會發見這一給被幅所蓋好的骷髏，但是並不如此，這一個給觀衆的興奮却終於有意的輕輕抹過。同次多次單純的以看護脫衣來提高肉感，也是不大妥當的，</p>
<p>白倍蘭史丹妃（ＢａｒｂａｒａＩｆａｎｗｙｃｋ）的表演，當然是很值得賞識的。她那圓潤的動作，毫不誇張的表情，都是討人歡喜的。配角方面，沒有什麽特殊可取的角色。</p>
<p>佈置很好，特别是是那富人家庭的　備，正足以寫出貴族婦人的舒適的生活。光線柔和優美，然並不如何奇特，發音清晰。但是對語太多，有如舞臺劇的味兒。雖然有許多精采之處，但决不是一般的中國人所能聽懂。</p>
<h3 id="c242">（二朋友之妻丨南京映 <a href="#c242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>— 神</p>
<p>［朋友之妻］ＦｒｉｅｎｄｓＬｏｖｅｒｓ，從［名］的方面論，已經夠得到說［好］的程度，四位著名的［名］星丨亞杜夫孟郁，麗蘭黛泰，伊立克馮史都漢和勞倫斯夏立費丨加上一個富有誘引性的［名］稱，從［實］的方面講，它有很戲劇化的故事，聰明的導演，巧妙的小動作。</p>
<p>故事似乎稍牽强，很簡單地叙述一個已嫁的少婦，不滿於夫婿的性情，又同時而不知覺地愛上了兩個同是英國駐印的防軍，同僚而好友的軍官，他倆是三Ｗ主義的信徒，崇拜着戰事，威士忌酒和婦人，但是，友誼終久戰勝了愛情。整部的演員都很盡職，充分地發揮他們的身份，便是那飾待僕的區歐琪何伯·也愽取我們的好感。</p>
<p>導演，像前面說，是很聰明的。對於小動作，尤其注重，像結末是英國將軍府，他們二個朋友又遇見達爾泰的時候，孟郁把香烟盒授烟給夏立費，夏立費呆住沒有知道等，都是很值得我們獎許我，光線是很優美，聲音似乎祗有九十九的清晰，也許因爲戲院的機械發生偶爾的不妥吧。</p>

<p>白蓓蘭史丹薇（ＢａｒｂａｒａＳｔａｎｗｙｃｋ）的作品雖然是寥寥無幾，在本埠開演過的祗有閑花淚（ＬａｄｉｅｓｏｆＬｅｉｓｕｒｅ）和［舞塲韻事］（Ｔｅｎｃｅｎａｄａｎｃｅ）兩部。可惜得很，前閱某雜誌，說她在攝影塲中工作最緊張的當兒，不知如何的跌傷了足踝。醫愈後行起路來，多少還有些蹺脚的様子。這麽一來，簡直把她的美麗損害了，也非常懊惱，决意離開電影界。誰知她休息一會兒，到底捨不得離開好萊塢，所以又重上銀幕了。她最近的作品是夜看護（Ｎｉｇｈｔｎｕｒｅｔｓ不久將在卡爾登開演。</p>

<p>— 依依</p>
<p>［如此英雄］，可說是國產影片中的第一張正式滑稽片，自有相當注意之價值，我看了還覺得滿意。</p>
<p>在這一片中，導演佈景，都沒有怎麽大缺點，不過劇情方面，在一些欠缺，狗主人家裏的小孩，爲什黀在半夜二點鐘，還會下樓來，放畫鬼臉的氣球？賊偷的箱子，拿的時候，似乎很重，大約放滿了東西的，爲什麽後來還藏得進一個小孩？</p>
<p>講到滑稽影片，本來是注重動作，不注重表情的，在這片中，二位主角的動作，還有相當的成功，面部的表情，也不十分差，</p>
<p>滑稽影片又最容易胡閙得一塌糊塗，這片的情節，雖然簡單，還不致閙得毫無意義。</p>

<p>丨西席地密耳代表作丨</p>
<p>西席地密耳是個十足代表美利堅國性的大導演，他常常化了整千整萬的金元，建築古代的都城皇宮等佈景，同時又不惜工本雇用大量的演員來攝製。他最善能處理那種偉大的婦孺皆知的史蹟，早年的成功作是［十誡］和［萬王之王］，最近的奇蹟，就是［羅宮春色］。</p>
<p>全部的演出是有極端異常的力量，演員都是一時之選，像弗德立馬區，伊麗莎蘭地，克勞黛考爾白，號稱［伊彌爾詹寗斯第二］的却利賴甫頓等都表演出他們最出色的表情。</p>
<p>本來，西席地密耳導演的影片，都是認真從事的，當攝製羅馬皇尼羅的窮極奢華的妻子寳比亞的浴室時，他就用了一千加侖的牛奶。因爲他研究古籍，發現寳比亞是每天要沐浴一次，是用五百頭騾子的乳汁來做［香湯］，不但在宮中是如此，就是出幸到别的地方，五百頭騾子也隨［駕］同行，爲了這一點，密耳氏特地到南加里福尼亞洲去尋求最廉價的牛奶。調查的結果，他估計着牛奶的價格，反而比用化學方法來造成的僞牛奶的價值還要便宜，所以毅然决然的採用了真牛奶，同時扮演［寳比亞］的克勞黛考爾白也欣慰她的肌膚，不致受到些微的損害。</p>
<p>等到這一次乳浴攝製後，這剩餘的一千加侖牛奶，就做了灌田的肥料。</p>
<p>同時，爲了一襲分量過重的服裝關係，把攝製的時間也展緩了。原因是寳比亞穿的一件服裝，有卅五磅重。攝製的時候，她老是站着，侍候這位暴君尼羅。密耳氏恐怕她挨受不住這重量，所以，特别准許克勞黛考爾白工作了一點鐘，休息一刻鐘，再繼續工作。</p>
<p>上面講的兩點，在銀幕上，不過顯映着幾分鐘就過去，，但，攝製的過程，就費了這許多時日許多精力，在這裏，我敢說，一寸一尺的膠片，都滲雜密耳氏的心血，因爲，在這部影片裏不僅有偉大的表現，同時還有一叚廻腸盪氣表現情愛尖銳化的故事。</p>

<p>Secretary-General Drummond Reported to the Meeting</p>
<p>Reply from Tokyo Telegraphed to Geneva Last Night</p>
<p>Declaring Opposition to Revoking Recognition of the Puppet State</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Nineteen-Nation Committee met at 10:35 this morning in the Secretary-General's office. The Swedish representative, Lange, chaired the meeting. Regarding the first three paragraphs of the draft report (namely, the first paragraph recalling past events in the Far East, the second paragraph regarding the situation in Geneva, and the third paragraph containing the conclusion), only minor revisions were made to the wording. The suggestions in the fourth chapter will be further discussed tomorrow morning. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 13th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Nineteen-Nation Committee held an important meeting at 10:30 this morning, lasting two hours until adjourning at 12:30 until tomorrow. The committee first listened to Secretary-General Drummond's report, then reviewed the first three paragraphs of the subcommittee's report. Drummond's report concerned his conversation with the Japanese chief delegate, Matsuoka, regarding the Rehe situation. Reportedly, Matsuoka stated that Rehe was part of Manchuria, and Zhang Xueliang's troops were massing on the border, numbering as many as 150,000, endangering Manchuria. Japan was bound by treaty to provide military assistance to [Manchukuo] to resist China's plan to separate Rehe from [Manchukuo]. However, the Japanese representative also stated that if the Chinese army did not attack, Japan did not want to disrupt the peace, etc. The Special Committee then discussed the drafting committee's report, making slight verbal corrections to the first and second paragraphs. Because the drafting committee decided to move the resolutions of the Administrative Council and the Briand Pact mentioned in the recommendations to the second paragraph, some other places were also slightly modified. Apart from this, the report was passed in its original form, and the conclusion was not changed. The English version of the recommendations has not yet been issued. It is believed that the English version will be finalized this afternoon and submitted to the Nineteen-Nation Committee for discussion tomorrow. Things proceeded very harmoniously and quickly at today's meeting. Matsuoka's remarks regarding Rehe have made a deep impression, and Japan's position can be clearly understood from this. However, this was not discussed at the meeting. Secretary-General Drummond sent a letter to the Japanese representative asking whether Japan admits that the political system of Manchuria, which it considers an independent country, is not a method for resolving disputes. Japan has not yet replied, and those present expressed disappointment, but it is heard that the Japanese cabinet has been discussing this matter for a long time, resulting in a delayed reply.

<h3 id="e3">Press Release Issued <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>The Nineteen-Nation Committee, after meeting this morning, issued the following press release this afternoon:</p>
<p>The Nineteen-Nation Committee today read and passed the first three paragraphs of the report, with some modifications. This report will be submitted to the League of Nations Assembly, so that it can be passed in accordance with Article 15, paragraph 4 of the League of Nations Covenant when a solution is impossible. The Nineteen-Nation Committee is scheduled to continue its meeting tomorrow morning to review the added amendments and begin studying the recommendations in the fourth section of the report submitted by the drafting committee. At this morning's meeting, the Secretary-General stated to the committee that on Thursday afternoon, in accordance with the instructions given by the Special Committee that morning, he met with the Japanese representative and urged him to pay attention to the information on the continuous military preparations and troop movements, because the Special Committee believed that this would increase the seriousness of the situation and, even if it did not disrupt the mediation efforts, it would endanger them. Matsuoka then detailed the situation in Rehe, saying that [Manchukuo] regarded Rehe as part of its territory. Matsuoka requested special attention be paid to the concentration of Chinese troops in Rehe, and to the obligation Japan assumed in the Japan-[Manchukuo] agreement to assist in maintaining the security of [Manchukuo]. Matsuoka also said that in this situation, he could not give the Special Committee any categorical statement regarding the future, but if the Chinese army withdrew from Rehe Province, the situation could obviously change. (Reuters dispatch from the 13th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) After the adjournment of the Special Committee, according to the German representative, Von Keller, and the Spanish representative, Madariaga, speaking to reporters, the amendments made this morning did not substantially change the fundamental claims of the report. It is heard that the committee members carefully read each line of the first three chapters of the report, and then, at the request of the Irish representative, Lister, that the wording of a certain historical narrative should be slightly sharper, five or six places were amended in wording, but it is heard that Lister's proposal only concerned the historical part and did not involve recommendations. (National News Agency dispatch from the 13th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Nineteen-Nation Committee now hopes to pass the recommendations in the proposed report tomorrow morning, but according to the Spanish representative, Madariaga, speaking to reporters this morning, it may be necessary to hold two more meetings before a final agreement can be reached on the report. Therefore, it is also possible that the League of Nations Assembly will be postponed until next Monday. (National News Agency dispatch from the 13th)</p>

<p>Preparing to Submit a Rebuttal to the Recommendations</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The content of the telegram of instruction from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Representative Matsuoka was drafted this morning and passed by the Ministry and will be submitted to the Cabinet for approval this afternoon before being issued at 6:00 pm tonight. (China United News Agency dispatch from the 13th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Cabinet convened an emergency cabinet meeting at 2:30 pm today at the Prime Minister's official residence. Foreign Minister Uchida explained the contents of the returned instruction. The two military ministers, Araki and Osumi, questioned him fiercely. After two hours of discussion, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' instruction案 was finally approved, and Foreign Minister Uchida was given full discretion to handle it. The meeting adjourned at 4:20 pm. (China United News Agency dispatch from the 13th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The content of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs' reply to the inquiry from the League of Nations Special Committee is heard to be as follows: 1. It declared that Japan considers the existence of [Manchukuo] the best guarantee for peace in the Far East and therefore cannot revoke its recognition of [Manchukuo]. 2. It declared that the failure of mediation under Article 15, paragraph 3 of the League of Nations Covenant is the fault of the League of Nations. 3. It indicated that if the Sino-Japanese dispute is subject to Article 15, paragraph 4 of the Covenant, Japan will submit a statement in accordance with paragraph 5 to refute allegations unfavorable to Japan. (Reuters dispatch from the 13th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not want to confirm or deny the content of the rumored Japanese reply to the League of Nations, only stating that the reply gave a factual negative answer to the League of Nations' inquiry. The reply was drafted based on the draft telegraphed to Tokyo by the Japanese representative in Geneva, Matsuoka. Although the spokesman was unwilling to answer whether Japan would withdraw from the League of Nations if the League of Nations made recommendations in accordance with Article 15, paragraph 4 of the Covenant, he did express his personal opinion, saying that Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations could be a predetermined conclusion. (Reuters dispatch from the 13th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is urgently preparing a statement under Article 15, paragraph 5 of the Covenant to refute the League of Nations report. It is heard that the points it is most vigorously arguing for are as follows: 1. The League of Nations has exceeded the scope of the Covenant by establishing special organs. The Japanese government absolutely does not recognize this kind of unauthorized action. 2. Inviting non-member states such as the United States and Russia to attend this organ is resolutely opposed by the Japanese government. 3. Even if this kind of organ is established, Japan will not allow it to interfere in matters concerning Japan. If the United States and Russia want to participate in this committee, Japan will directly protest to those two countries. 4. The report points out that Japan's military actions in Manchuria exceed the scope of the right of self-defense, which is especially inappropriate. The interpretation of self-defense should be entirely based on the independent interpretation of the country concerned. It is extremely dangerous for a third party to arbitrarily judge the right or wrong of self-defense. The US government has also expressed its opinion on this matter. 5. Japan recognizes [Manchukuo] as the only way to promote peace in the Far East, so Japan can never undo this fact. 6. The League of Nations has produced such an irresponsible and empty report, and therefore, the League of Nations should be responsible for the major chaos in the international political situation that may arise in the future.

<h3 id="e5">Japanese Delegation Considering a Risky Withdrawal <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>If the League of Nations Is Unwilling to Yield and Compromise</p>
<p>The Japanese Delegation Will Temporarily Evacuate to Paris</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to the Tokyo Newspaper, the Japanese representative in Geneva, Matsuoka, the arms reduction representative, Ambassador Sato, and Ambassador Nagaoka, are separately discussing ways to withdraw from the League of Nations. The content of the discussion includes three points: 1. [Method of Withdrawal]: First, withdraw the delegation, and then declare the withdrawal at a later date, or withdraw at the same time as the Assembly opposes the recommendation, but no conclusion has been reached in the discussion. 2. [Arms Reduction Conference]: Because the arms reduction negotiations are bound to fail, if the delegation is withdrawn early, the failure will be blamed on Japan. Therefore, it is better to continue to deal with it perfunctorily. 3. Other issues such as the International Labor Conference, international information exchange, the South Seas administration, and the World Economic Conference have not reached a conclusion. (China United News Agency dispatch from the 13th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese military has repeatedly threatened the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to make a decision to withdraw from the League of Nations. Because most of the senior officials and financial circles oppose radical policies, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has shown that it cannot firmly obey the military. It is rumored that if the League of Nations does invoke Article 15, paragraph 4, Representative Matsuoka will be ordered to declare his opposition at the Assembly, and then the delegation will evacuate to Paris, temporarily waiting for the League of Nations to yield to Japan and find a compromise solution. If the League of Nations is unwilling to yield to Japan, it will ask the Privy Council to hold a meeting to agree to implement the withdrawal from the League of Nations. It is heard that the Army Department still insists that the arms reduction representative must take the same attitude. Other matters such as the World Economic Conference, the International Labor Conference, and the exchange of information have not been decided because they have not been prepared early.

<p>The recommendation decided by the Drafting Committee in Geneva will be reviewed by the Nineteen-Nation Committee meeting on the 13th. Combining the opinions of important committee members, it will not be fundamentally changed, but only the wording will be revised in some places and handed over to the Assembly. The degree of toughness of this recommendation is almost incomparable to the resolution of December. The reason is that the European countries, which have no knowledge of the actual situation in the Orient, lack understanding of Rehe Province and refuse to recognize Rehe Province as part of [Manchukuo]. The League of Nations, which initially held a cold attitude towards the suppression of Su Bingwen, suddenly interpreted Rehe as an act of aggression, reaching a conclusion that cannot be compromised with Japan. The intention is to cover up the powerlessness of the League of Nations, establish close ties with the United States, and make the recommendation a powerful one.

<h3 id="e7">Diplomatic Authorities' Views on the Recommendations <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Believing That They Are Still in Line with Our Claims</p>
<p>The League of Nations Assembly Should Resolutely Pass Them</p>
<p>And Find Ways to Implement Them to Safeguard Peace</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Drafting Committee of the League of Nations Nine-Nation Committee has completed the recommendation portion of the report. Today, a Central News Agency reporter visited the diplomatic authorities to inquire about their views on the recommendation portion. The diplomatic authorities said that the report was still a draft and were unwilling to formally express their views, but they said that the recommendation portion determines that Japan should bear responsibility for the September 18th Incident, does not recognize the puppet organization, and invites the United States and Russia to participate in the negotiating committee. The above points are in line with our country's long-standing claims and are considered satisfactory. They also said that since the Nine-Nation Committee has resolutely drafted a fair report, the League of Nations Assembly should also resolutely pass it when it meets. Most importantly, after the League of Nations Assembly passes the report, it should do its utmost to implement it, so that peace in the Far East can be effectively guaranteed, avoiding the past resolutions that have become mere scraps of paper.

<h3 id="e8">Chen Youren's Remarks <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Hoping That the Whole Country Will Support the Government</p>
<p>To Resist Further Japanese Aggression</p>
<p>▲Reuters Today (13th) afternoon, a Reuters reporter visited former Foreign Minister Chen Youren, who is currently in Shanghai, to ask for his opinion on the draft report of the Nine-Person Subcommittee. Chen said that if this report means that the League of Nations is determined to strictly implement the theory of this report when necessary, and even apply Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant to impose sanctions, then this report will be effective. If not, more serious developments will follow within a few weeks after the report is released, not only in Rehe, but also in the entire North China, just as Japan responded to the establishment of the Investigative Group with the establishment of [Manchukuo]. In other words, if the draft report is only another form of mediation policy, or a move similar to the League of Nations escaping its predicament, then Japan will definitely create a new situation in North China, causing the League of Nations solution contained in the draft report to ultimately fail. However, if Japan is convinced that the countries of the League of Nations, especially Britain and France, will implement their words with resolute action in the meaning of Article 16 of the Covenant, then Japan will inevitably change its current policy of aggression. Chen concluded by saying that this move by the League of Nations should encourage China to armed resist Japanese aggression. What I mean by resistance is not local resistance, but national resistance. The current forms of resistance are only local in nature and can never be successful. China's only hope lies in the people uniting to support the government and resisting Japan with the strength of the whole country.</p>

<p>Japan, in Opposition to World Public Opinion, Will Inevitably Suffer the Consequences</p>
<p>(London) Several London morning newspapers today commented on the recommendations regarding the Sino-Japanese dispute drafted by the Geneva Drafting Committee. The Daily Telegraph reported that this report advocates direct negotiations between China and Japan to seek a solution. The League of Nations' involvement in this dispute should end here, because the League of Nations has exhausted the possibility of mediation and placed the responsibility for illegal actions within Manchuria on Japan. The Liberal Party's Daily News reported that the report is straightforward in every respect and does not favor Japan. However, it would certainly be unfair to consider that it is out of anti-Japanese sentiment. The League of Nations has treated Japan with the utmost benevolence, almost to the point of bringing shame to the League of Nations. The judgment against Japan is not unjust because the facts are so. Japan can escape the consequences by accepting this judgment, otherwise, Japan will inevitably suffer the consequences of opposing the public opinion of the civilized world. The Labor Party's organ, the Daily Herald, stated that the League of Nations has shown extraordinary patience, but has ultimately failed to bring about reconciliation. Future developments may be rapid and serious. (Reuters dispatch from the 13th)</p>

<p>Comparing It to a Mathematical Game is Absurd and Inappropriate</p>
<p>(Geneva) On the 12th, the Japanese delegation released the following informal views on the draft report prepared by the Drafting Committee: 1. The report completely disregards the situations in China and Manchuria. 2. The League of Nations' only mission is reconciliation, but the report has forgotten the League of Nations' position and expressed national opinions, with the intention of making a judgment. 3. The League of Nations is in a completely mentally deranged state. 4. The League of Nations is nothing more than a mathematical game of the Lytton Report, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the League of Nations Covenant. The report is the result of removing the greatest common divisor for the Sino-Japanese problem from these treaties. 5. The most noteworthy point in the recommendation is the non-recognition of [Manchukuo]. Since the League of Nations has challenged Japan's established policy and Japan, Japan can no longer cooperate with the League of Nations. 6. The committee of the negotiating committee consists of twelve countries. Such a large number cannot exert its function, and inviting the United States and Russia is a unilateral change to the League of Nations' structure. 7. In short, the report was not created because of the failure of reconciliation, but to block the means of reconciliation. It completely disregards reality and is always full of European abstract concepts, and is a mathematical paper that has nothing to do with the Sino-Japanese problem.

Our side has provided relief, and the county government has properly arranged for the aftermath for the people and those affected. (13th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Jinan) Zhang Lianjia, Director of the River Affairs Bureau, returned to Jinan this time to report to Han about the situation of the Yellow River thawing and flooding. According to him, the river ice had thawed from the upper reaches to Tangjia in Huimin County by the 11th. On the cold night of the 12th, it refroze to the Jidong area. The ice flowing down from the upper reaches was squeezed at Tangjia, raising the water level significantly. The roots of the dikes were submerged in water for seventy to eighty miles, more severe than the flooding of twenty years ago. Fortunately, the river channel in the Tangjia area is relatively wide. If it had been squeezed in the narrow area of Gongjiazuizi, the danger would have been unimaginable. Fortunately, it is now warm, and if the ice downstream can gradually flow smoothly into the sea, this year's flooding can be safely passed. He will go to the northern bank of the downstream area again in the next few days to supervise the flood prevention work. Also, the water level at Wangwangzhuang downstream is 15.7 meters, which is three minutes higher than the great flood last summer. If it rises again, it would be worrying. Many houses in the river beach villages have been flooded. The county magistrate and public security chief of Lijin County have both gone to the dikes to supervise and lead the people in抢护ing. Also, this year, because the river ice is particularly thick and strong, the entire river dike has been擦伤ed. The River Affairs Bureau will carry out major engineering projects after the flooding has passed. (13th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e25">The Consequences of Proceeding with Paragraph 4 of Article 15 of the League of Nations Covenant <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>(I) The Nine-Member Drafting Committee Advocates Fairness</p>
<p>For the past year and a half, Japan has been acting unilaterally, basing everything on military force. Two divisions of the army caused the September 18th Incident, seized Jinzhou, and engulfed North Manchuria. Three thousand naval landing forces created the January 28th Bloody Incident, shelling Wusong and burning Zhabei. Now, they shamelessly argue that Rehe is part of the [Manchurian territory] and will inevitably use force, and will also disturb eastern Shandong and attack Beiping and Tianjin. Their invasion of our Chinese territory, their trampling of our Chinese people, and their opening of a new record of military imperialist invasion throughout history are all that remain. The destruction of the [Nine-Power Treaty] and the abandonment of the [Kellogg-Briand Pact] are secondary matters. The League of Nations accommodates military force and preserves face. Therefore, from the previous year to the present, it has consistently adhered to its peaceful aims and has tried to mediate. However, the Japanese warlords' aggressive fervor has reached its peak. In addition to肆its military force,撕碎ing all international conventions, and betraying international信義, they have repeatedly expressed contempt for the League of Nations, revealing their intention to provoke a world war. What is especially strong and unreasonable is to refer to the puppet state created by their warlords as an established fact, saying that even if [the whole country turns into scorched earth, it must maintain Manchuria.] Even the Osaka Asahi Shimbun's editorial, which is 目妄like this violent statement, cannot but add a considerable criticism. If we make a fair and reasonable criticism, then it can be called crazy. It can also be called completely devoid of humanity. How can there be a country in the world that invades the territory of others and slaughters the people of other countries, and yet advocates for peace and安寗? Moreover, since the invasion and occupation of the three northeastern provinces and the establishment of the Manchurian puppet state, the so-called 安寗 and peace is only安寗 and peace on the newspapers that resonate with the Japanese and the military department. Five师圑, two cavalry旅圑, one flight联队, and other special forces are stationed all over the railway lines. The people of Northeast China (except for a very small number of puppets) are all in danger, 流亡載道,烽烟四起,鷄犬不安. Is this called peace and 安寗? Therefore, the Lytton Investigation Team and the League of Nations also suspected Japan's so-called facts. Thus, the Nine-Member Drafting Committee wrote directly and clearly in ten conclusions. We, in addition to expressing considerable approval here, can only recognize the ability of the Nine-Member Committee to clearly understand as the only symbol of the reinstatement of公理 in the past year.</p>
<p>(II) The Efforts That Our Country Should Make in the Future</p>
<p>The draft of the Nine-Member Committee, if approved by the Nineteen-Nation Committee, can be passed in the League of Nations General Assembly. Then, our country's appeals to the League of Nations in recent years can be considered to have been successful. It can be said that we have exhausted our diplomatic abilities.</p>
<p>However, it is well known and recognized by our country's authorities that the League of Nations is only a moral sanctioning body at most. It has also been repeatedly resolved in the past that the Japanese army should withdraw to the South Manchuria Railway line. In the end, it was unable to execute due to the Japanese army's ferocity. Today's resolution is similar to yesterday's resolution, and the Japanese militarists' barbarity is even greater than before. The use of morality may not be able to stop the violence of military force. Moreover, the past events of the fall of Shanhaiguan, the alarm in Rehe, the repeated击in Kailu and Chaoyang, and the loss of Jinzhou are still like 日. What can the League of Nations do? What can our country do?</p>
<p>Or some may think that the League of Nations has already implemented the recommendation of paragraph 4 of Article 15 of the Covenant. If there is no result, it may launch Article 16 to impose economic sanctions. However, we must know that although capitalist countries oppose each other, the only factor in their opposition ultimately lies in their own interests. How can they徒sacrifice for others' [公道正義]? As for the attack of public opinion, it is only a positive moral help. How can we be sure that the Japanese warlords will comply? Moreover, Japanese imperialists have publicly stated that their continental policy is 丨丨aggressive behavior [maintaining peace in East Asia.] How can they丝毫愿及 the so-called [公理和平] of world opinion?</p>
<p>Today, verbal disputes are徒然. Moreover, Japan has mobilized a large army, concentrating the 6th Division, the 8th Division, the 1st and 4th Cavalry旅圑, and the飞行联队 in the Jinxi and Tongliao areas. Even untrained soldiers are added to the front line and deployed to invade Rehe on a large scale. (This is already an action taken by the Japanese 閥 before advocating for direct Sino-Japanese negotiations.) Recently, they issued the claim that they must occupy Rehe. Can this kind of military action be裁制ed by public opinion? How can they fear the裁制 of public opinion?</p>
<p>Our country is in great danger and in万分危迫. How can we sit and wait for others to宰割 without thinking of ways to save ourselves? Now that international public opinion has turned to our country's support, we should seize the opportunity to rise up and save ourselves urgently. The way to save ourselves is to fight against Japan. The fight comes down to two paths: First, mobilize the vast masses of our country to wage a non-bloody economic war against the enemy. However, this has been tried and failed repeatedly, and ultimately failed. Second, we can only fight a bloody battle back-to-back,求生 in death, and resist the violence that has unreasonably invaded us again and again with military force. Then the 公理 advocated by the international community can be powerful, and our Chinese nation can have a way to be born again.</p>

<p>(Beiping) This afternoon, Song Ziwen hosted the press at the Diplomatic Building. He stated that he was here to discuss financial issues in North China and would return to Nanjing in two or three days. Regarding military affairs in North China, Chairman Chiang has requested Zhang to take full responsibility. The central government attaches equal importance to Jehol, Guangdong, Jiangsu, and other provinces. If Japan invades, they will resist to the death and defend their territory. Central finances are open. His visit is only to seek rapid deployment of troops in the midst of financial difficulties. The southward transport of antiquities is purely for protection. The central government still emphasizes people over material in Beiping. The Sino-Japanese trade agreement expires on May 16 and will not be renewed. If Japan withdraws from the League of Nations, it will lose international sympathy and is destined for failure. The abolition of the tael and the adoption of the yuan will be implemented after approval by the Central Political Council. Zhu Qinglan and Shang Zhen visited Song Ziwen one after another this afternoon and talked for a long time. (Special dispatch, 16th)</p>

Although the central government cannot fully supply the North China army, everyone will share the rice if there is any. The generals in North China were satisfied with the military budget. Wang Jingwei left France on the 10th of this month and is expected to arrive around the 3rd or 4th of next month. It is still to be decided whether he will attend the World Economic Conference. He has not heard anything about Duan Qirui being appointed as the head of the National Defense Commission in Nanjing, so it is probably inaccurate.

<p>(Beiping) This afternoon, a Reuters reporter visited Song Ziwen, the acting president of the Executive Yuan. He stated that his visit to Beiping was related to the situation in Jehol. The central government attaches great importance to the Japanese plot to attack Jehol. Jehol is an integral part of China, just like Guangdong and Jiangsu. An attack on Jehol is tantamount to an attack on the capital. If the Japanese carry out the attack, we will deal with it with the strength of the whole country. Since Japan has already occupied the northeastern part of China, if they advance further, they will be resisted. The reporter asked if the Japanese army invades Jehol, will China declare war on Japan? Song replied, why should the victim declare war? Japan is the aggressor. Although it has never declared war on China, all its actions and purposes are to wage war on China. The reporter asked about the status of North China. Song replied that Zhang Xueliang is the representative of the central government and acts in accordance with the orders of the central government. If the Jehol war breaks out, Zhang will be the commander-in-chief in office. Song also expressed his personal opinion on the current state of war between China and Japan, saying that if the Japanese army really invades Jehol Province, he thinks it is unnecessary to keep the Chinese ambassador in Tokyo, because dealing with Japan diplomatically is no longer helpful. Song also said that Director of the Public Health Department, Liu Ruiheng, had come to Beiping with him to supervise the preparations for establishing battlefield hospitals and to engage in any necessary medical planning. This shows the central government's emphasis on the situation in Jehol. Song also plans to stay in Beiping for a few days. (Reuters dispatch, 3rd)</p>

<p>Substance of Policies in Far East and Europe Remains Unchanged</p>
<p>But Will Use Straightforward Methods to Seek Rapid Resolution</p>
<p>▲National News Agency Washington dispatch, 13th According to a Democratic Party leader, American diplomacy will undergo a change after the Democratic government takes office. However, what will change is not the policy, but the methods and procedures so that ordinary diplomatic problems can be resolved quickly. As for the policies on Europe and the Far East, there will be no substantive changes. However, the formal and slow methods left over from the Root era will be removed for the most part after the party takes office on March 4. Roosevelt's informal war debt talks with British Ambassador Outram Lindsay can be seen as an example of a new trend in American diplomatic methods. After this conversation, both sides have a clear understanding of the war debt issue when the British representatives come to the United States for negotiations in the future. Its effect is greater than years of formal negotiations. Therefore, Roosevelt advocates handling diplomacy. When informal procedures are available, formal and slow procedures should not be used. Therefore, the Secretary of State selected will also differ from Eliahu Root. Root was a member of Root's law firm and was influenced by Root. Therefore, he inherited Root's model, which has been deeply rooted in American diplomatic methods for 21 years. In the future, although some of Root's proposals will still remain within diplomatic policy, their effect will largely become historical achievements. Root served as President Roosevelt's Secretary of State in 1905. During his four years in office, he co-created the Hague Tribunal and the Root method for the United States to participate in the tribunal. He also initiated 33 arbitration treaties. The first arbitration treaty in 1908 was drafted by him.</p>

<p>▲National News Agency Washington dispatch, 12th President-elect Garner admitted today that he has begun a movement to make Roosevelt a true dictator, with unlimited power even in finance. However, he also admitted that this plan will not pass if it is put to a vote in Congress. The management of the US government's finances has always been solely controlled by Congress. Garner's plan is to give the next president almost dictatorial powers, allowing them to supervise the budgets of various departments and order spending cuts at any time without seeking congressional approval in advance. According to this plan, Congress will only retain the power to audit and investigate to restrain the president. However, many congressmen believe that this plan will cause many difficulties and may even raise the issue of the limits of executive and legislative powers. Even within the Democratic Party itself, there is strong opposition to expanding the president's financial powers. Therefore, Garner has also said that he may be forced to propose a compromise plan.</p>

<p>Expand Military Dogs and Supplement Officers</p>
<p>▲Reuters Tokyo dispatch, 13th According to today's news, the Japanese Ministry of the Army has decided to add military dogs and carrier pigeons for military use in Manchuria, considering their effectiveness. The plan to expand the military dog ​​regiment will be completed within five years. In the military budget for 1933-34, an expenditure of 50,000 yen has been included to purchase 300 military dogs. These military dogs are trained by a certain infantry school. The school is currently planning to improve the method. A new military dog ​​regiment will now be stationed in the Japanese defense barracks in Gongzhuling, Manchuria. As for carrier pigeons, this year the Kanto Army can be supplied in greater numbers from the Nakano area. The [Manchukuo] Army Department will also use 300 pigeons that have been well trained for military communication.</p>
<p>▲Japanese United News Agency Tokyo dispatch, 13th The Ministry of the Army has been considering ways to supplement the number of active-duty officers since last year due to the insufficient number. Recently, it has been decided to recruit 800 officers from the civilian population, and specific measures will be formally announced soon. This is an emergency new system since the army began. Applicants must be reserve second lieutenants and lieutenants in the youth reserve army. After joining the team, the salary and treatment are the same as those of active-duty officers from military schools, and they will serve as important positions such as squad leaders or regimental officers and will be on the front lines of the Japanese army.</p>
<p>▲Reuters Tokyo dispatch, 13th During the budget committee meeting, someone asked whether [Manchukuo] would share the expenses of Japan's military use in Manchukuo. Minister of the Army Araki replied that [Manchukuo] should bear a portion of the military expenses, but no concrete decision has been made yet. Although the finances of the [Manchukuo] government are not difficult, they need funds to run industries. During the discussion, someone suggested that the benefits of various businesses in [Manchukuo] should not be held by a few people. This proposal was approved. The government stated that it is willing to make the people share the benefits.</p>
<h3 id="e78">Korean Martyr Group Activities <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Organizing Volunteer Army in Yanji Area (Chinese Joint News Agency Seoul Telegram) The organization of the Righteous Patriots Corps has recently been discovered in the Korean independence movement. Since the September 18th Incident, its organization has expanded its activities more and more. In addition to organizing an independent volunteer army in the vicinity of Yanji to fight against Japanese pirates, it has also repeatedly sent core cadres to organize assassination groups to sneak into Manchuria, Korea, and all over Japan to assassinate all warlords and aggressors. Among the members of the group, there is Jin Yifeng and Zhang Renui, who secretly received orders from Bian Luogui to sneak into Decheon County, Pingan South Province, to plan to blow up the railway to stop the Japanese army from transporting troops to the northeast. However, before the incident was completed, they were captured on the 7th of this month. Because the incident was of great importance, Jin and Zhang were interrogated separately. Because Jin Yifeng did not say a word during the interrogation and refused to answer any questions, the Japanese police could not do anything. Then they showed him the explosives they used to investigate the method of use. At this time, Jin seized the bomb, taking into account the overall situation, and threw it on the spot. The explosives exploded, and Jin died for the overall situation on the same day. Many Japanese police were also injured. The other Zhang Zhang Rui also absolutely strictly guarded the secrets of the group. Although the Japanese police brutally tortured and beat him, they could not do anything about it. When Koreans across the country heard the news, they deeply felt that his ambition was admirable. Currently, all regions are secretly preparing a memorial service for martyr Jin Yifeng.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Hitler Announces Foreign Policy <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Not Abandoning Colonial Aspirations</p>
<p>Willing to Cooperate Closely with Britain</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Berlin, 12th. The London Sunday Dispatch's representative interviewed German Chancellor Hitler, who disclosed his greatest aspiration in foreign policy. Today, right-wing newspapers largely agree with Hitler's statements. For example, Hitler insisted that the so-called "Polish Corridor" should eventually be returned to Germany, as Germany believes the creation of this corridor was the greatest injustice inflicted upon Germany by the Treaty of Versailles. He also stated that Germany has not abandoned its grand ambition for colonies, as Germany, like other countries, urgently needs them. Most right-wing newspapers fully agree with this. Furthermore, Hitler explicitly stated that the restoration of the monarchy is out of the question, because at this time of national crisis, when the whole country urgently needs to unite to cope with the situation, raising the issue of republic versus monarchy would only increase domestic divisions and further chaos. This statement has also attracted considerable attention. As for Hitler's declaration that he sincerely desires close cooperation with Britain and that, if circumstances permit, he is unwilling to hurt anyone's feelings, many here believe that this can dispel rumors of the new German government intending to initiate a policy of aggression.</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Paris, 12th. French Prime Minister Daladier expressed disagreement with the actions of certain nationalist societies that are using the excuse of Germany's political changes to incite public sentiment at home. He also published his views in his party newspaper, stating that the reorganization of the German government undoubtedly has implications for Germany's subsequent disarmament and economic cooperation. However, any changes to these plans must first be carefully considered, and no participation in any gestures of politeness will be permitted. Furthermore, if the Republican majority in Congress can pass the government's economic proposals as soon as possible, it will not only strengthen the nation's finances but also promote world peace.</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Berlin, 13th. Over the weekend, political conflicts in various parts of Germany resulted in a total of eight deaths and thirty-seven injuries. Among the dead were two communists, five members of the National Socialist Party, and one person with no political affiliation. The most violent clash occurred in Lutherstadt. Initially, National Socialist stormtroopers were marching in the city when shots were fired from a building inhabited by communist members, leading to a fierce fight. Police suppression proved difficult. Several injured individuals are in critical condition. The governors of the areas where the incidents occurred have been dismissed or advised to retire by the Ministry of the Interior.</p>

<p>Regardless of Election Results</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Berlin, 12th. Tonight, National People's Party leader Hugenberg gave a speech at the Sport Palace that was highly suggestive. Hugenberg declared, "We are determined to resist whatever may happen in the future." Deputy Chancellor von Papen and Minister of Agriculture and Economy Seldte were also present that evening, standing under the old imperial flag. The flag was hung because Prince Oskar, the fifth son of the former emperor, was in attendance, as a sign of respect. Many speakers that evening subtly indicated that the current Hitler cabinet will remain in office regardless of the outcome of the general election. Over the weekend, clashes between the National Socialist Party and the Communist Party in various parts of Germany resulted in dozens of deaths and injuries.</p>
<p>▲ Havas, Berlin, 12th. Chancellor Hitler delivered an election speech in Kassel, saying that he hopes that in the next parliament, the government parties will occupy 52 to 54 percent of the seats and obtain an absolute majority.</p>

<p>▲ Reuters, Amsterdam, 12th. Today, rumors are circulating that sailors on several destroyers will follow the example of the patrol ship in the province of Texel. As a result, the sentries at the Dutch naval base in Den Helder have been doubled, and officers are guarding the base with pistols. Authorities claim that these rumors are unfounded but admit that precautions have been taken to prevent accidents. Den Helder is currently as peaceful as usual, and one person has been arrested, but no one is allowed to enter the naval defense area. Several torpedo boats are berthed nearby with their fires lit, and the naval airfield is illuminated all night as if it were daytime. Some army units have also been mobilized to deal with any emergencies.</p>

<p>Parliamentarians Become Impatient</p>
<p>Some Even Dozing at Their Desks</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Paris, 13th. The duration of the current parliamentary session to discuss the budget has broken previous records. By 11:00 this morning, it had lasted for twenty-six hours. After a two-hour break for lunch, the session continued in the afternoon and seemed likely to extend into the evening, as the most critical item, the surtax, had just been reached. Parliamentarians worked in shifts, and many were dozing at their desks, instructing attendants to wake them for the vote. However, Budget Minister Lemaire and Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies Herriot worked continuously for twenty-eight hours and were exhausted.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Records from Aftermath of Neukirchen Disaster in Germany <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Deputy Chancellor Represents Government at Burial</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Neukirchen, 12th. The cleanup work after the disaster is nearing completion. According to current calculations, the death toll from this disaster has reached sixty-six, and one hundred and sixty people are injured, many of whom remain in the hospital in serious condition. It has been decided that the funeral for the deceased will be held on Tuesday. Deputy Chancellor von Papen will represent the government at the ceremony. Many condolence messages have been received from around the world, including from the President of France, British Foreign Secretary Simon, and Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss. The cause of the accident has not yet been definitively determined, but it is known that before the explosion, flames were seen emanating from the gas storage tanks.</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Neukirchen, 13th. The crisis from the explosion has passed, but the town of Neukirchen has been reduced to ashes, as if it had been subjected to hours of intense bombardment. As a result, people from southwestern Germany have been flocking to see the disaster area since yesterday, with over one hundred thousand visitors so far. Fifty-four bodies have been recovered and are still identifiable, including twenty-one gas plant workers, three other men (one of whom was an artist visiting on vacation), and twenty-one women, thirteen of whom were also employed at the gas plant. In addition, there were eight children. The remaining bodies have been burned beyond recognition.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Neukirchen, 13th. Today, families of the dead and missing went to the disaster site to find bodies in the rubble and mourn their homes. The scene was very tragic. Occasionally, when a woman found the body of her son or husband, she would rush forward, caress the body, and weep bitterly. If they found their child's usual toys, they would quickly pick them up, bringing tears to the eyes of those who witnessed it. At that time, the entire village was shrouded in a tragic atmosphere. The sounds of weeping were unforgettable. It has now been confirmed that a small explosion occurred at a benzol plant before the gas storage tank exploded. Some residents, alarmed by this, fled with their entire families, which saved many of the town's forty thousand residents. It is estimated that it will take at least a year to restore the town to its former appearance. It is reported that the victims will be buried tomorrow morning, at which time Deputy Chancellor von Papen will represent the government and the entire German people at the funeral. The federal government has declared Tuesday a day of mourning.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Overt Competition Between Japan and the US, Covert Struggles Between Japan and the Soviet Union (Japan News) <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Military Preparations Compete with Each Other, Japanese-British Goodwill Gradually Decreases</p>
<p>Although Japan is wholeheartedly militaristic, it knows that three fists cannot beat four hands, and it knows the difficult situation it is currently in. If hegemony in the Pacific is not seized by Japan, then competition in the West Pacific, especially in the superior position in the Chinese market, will be difficult to maintain. Therefore, this year it will add one 10,000-ton submarine tender, two destroyers, and two 8,500-ton cruisers. In this way, Japan's naval power will increase again. The US Asiatic Fleet, with only one 10,000-ton cruiser as its flagship, will truly not be worth a strike.</p>
<p>Therefore, the United States of America is also trembling with fear, seeking a way to preserve itself. The first is to keep the Atlantic Fleet in the Pacific for the long term to guard against emergencies. This is not entirely intended to attack, but the significance of defending Honolulu outweighs other considerations. At the same time, the Senate Naval Committee proposed a naval shipbuilding plan until 1936], planning to build three aircraft carriers, nine cruisers, eighty-nine destroyers, and thirty-four submarines, totaling one hundred and thirty-five ships and 316,530 tons. In such a bad market, it is desperately trying to replenish warships. What is the purpose? Everyone knows it.</p>
<p>However, Japan has not reflected on this at all and has become even more violent. For example, its invasion of Manchuria, not to mention foreigners, even knowledgeable people in Japan, from the Communist Party to the liberals, have expressed their full dissatisfaction. However, the warlords are still desperately stubborn, wanting to expand the chaos to Jehol, extend it to Tianjin, and even spread it to Shandong. In short, they want to monopolize the Chinese market. Therefore, even Britain, which has always been pro-Japanese [formerly an ally of Japan], feels that Japan is too domineering and unreasonable [not only wants to swallow "Manchuria" whole, but also has the preparation and intention to squeeze other forces out of North China]. Therefore, British goodwill towards Japan seems to be gradually decreasing, and the League of Nations also has a tendency to restrain Japan.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Soviet Union, which is in an adversarial position with Japan on land and is also the enemy that Japan uses as an excuse, has a cold and indifferent eye towards the Northeast issue and Japan's attack on North China and annexation of Manchuria, observing quietly from the sidelines. However, its military preparations are very sufficient, and Japan is indeed somewhat wary of it. Therefore, one part of Japan's new plan to strengthen national defense this year also imitates the Soviet Union's intention to train mechanized troops. However, it did not set up mechanized troop divisions like the Soviet Union. It only expanded the 1st Tank Company attached to the 12th Division into a tank regiment, and at the same time expanded the tank team of the Chiba Army Engineering School into a regiment. The expansion cost for these two regiments this year alone is 11 million yen, which will probably be completed by June. At the same time, the 19th Division was mobilized to North Manchuria for security, adding a current cancerous tumor.</p>
<p>Since the conflict between Japan and the Soviet Union is becoming increasingly acute, things are also very coincidental. In January of this year, four Soviet whaling ships sailed from the Indian Ocean, originally intending to engage in whaling in the Sea of Okhotsk (among them, the Arius was an old 5,000-ton ship, serving as a mother ship, and the other three were each 260 tons, recently assembled in Norway). For some reason, they mistakenly entered the military fortress area of Futami Port on the Ogasawara Islands. As a result, the red fishing boats were arrested.</p>
<p>Initially, according to the opinion of the Tokyo District Court, they were to be charged with military espionage for spying on the fortress (measuring the depth of the harbor and surveying the situation). Later, the Ministry of Justice thought this was very inappropriate, so it dropped the military espionage charge. However, [Futami Port] is not a commercial port, so they were charged with violating the Shipping Act. Originally, they intended to confiscate the three whaling ships, but after consultations between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Justice, they believed that if they really confiscated the ships, their value would only be one million yen, and the diplomatic relations between Japan and the Soviet Union would be further strained. Therefore, they stopped confiscating the ships and used the following charges:</p>
<p>(1) The Ogasawara Islands are a "non-opening port." The Arius should not have led the other three ships to call for supplies of drinking water and coal.</p>
<p>(2) The captain of the ship should have known that the area was a fortress area and should not have entered it arbitrarily.</p>
<p>(3) Even if measuring the water depth could be excused for navigational safety, violating the Shipping Act was very serious.</p>
<p>Therefore, the three captains were each fined 1,500 yen, and the storm came to an end. However, the rift between Japan and the Soviet Union and the opposition between Japan and the United States became more and more serious. (February 9)</p>

<p>Xi'an Administrative Office Not Temporarily Abolished</p>
<p>Western Hubei Armies Jointly Urge Hefei to Surrender</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence, He Chengjun, Pacification Commissioner for Hubei, recently returned to Wuhan from Xi'an and went to Nanchang to pay respects to Commander-in-Chief Chiang, reporting on the progress of the suppression of Xu bandit and requesting instructions. He then returned to Wuhan at 11:00 AM on the 11th. According to He's statement, after I arrived in Nanchang, I paid respects to Commander-in-Chief Chiang three times, reporting on the progress of the pursuit and suppression of Xu bandit and requesting instructions on everything. The Commander-in-Chief gave instructions on everything and particularly praised the officers and soldiers for their bravery in suppressing the bandits. The remnants of Xu bandit have now been surrounded and fiercely suppressed by the Sichuan and Shaanxi armies, and the Central Government has also sent considerable forces to assist. They can be eliminated in a short period of time. The Xi'an Administrative Office will not be temporarily abolished for the time being and will still be handled by Director Guan Linshu. I will go to Shaanxi again when necessary. The bandit suppression forces in Jiangxi Province were originally very strong. Since Commander-in-Chief Chiang came to Jiangxi, the morale has been even more boosted. Wherever the army goes, the ugly creatures are defeated. Commander-in-Chief Chen (Cheng) is now supervising his troops and joining forces with friendly forces to pursue forward from Fuzhou. The remnants of Zhu Mao bandits are scattered and lack supplies. Knowing that they cannot resist, they still want to use their old tricks to flee to the Fujian border. However, the 19th Route Army has already deployed heavy troops at all key points and is strictly blocking them. The Guangdong army is also gradually advancing and surrounding the bandits. Chen Jitang's representative, Yang Dezhao, is currently stationed in Nanchang, constantly consulting with Commander-in-Chief Chiang on the strategy of suppression. The elimination of this bandit force can also be expected in a matter of days. As for when Commander-in-Chief Chiang will come to Huanggang, I have not heard anything. Chief of Staff Cao Haosen met with Commander-in-Chief Chiang in Nanchang and traveled with me to Xunyang. I returned to Hankou, and Cao went to Beijing. He will return immediately after completing his official business. When He returned to Hankou from Shaanxi, the bandit suppression affairs on the Sichuan border were the responsibility of Tian Songyao, Commander of the 29th Army and Commissioner of Bandit Suppression in the Sichuan-Shaanxi Border Region. In the past ten days, the bandits have still occupied Tongjiang and Bazhong counties without much change. Tian has ordered Sun Zhen, the commander of the vanguard, to lead 36 regiments to advance and suppress bandits across Tongchuan. Tian also went to the front in person. It is said that the general offensive began on the 9th, and another general offensive order will be issued on the 12th. It is now heard that the remnants of Hefei have fled back to the Hubei border. He Jian has sent troops from Hunan to pursue them, and Fan Xiji has also gone to Yichang to personally supervise the suppression at Yeshan Pass and Enshi. Xu Yuanquan returned to Shashi by plane on the 11th after meeting with He and will also go to the front line to command. (February 11)</p>

<p>And Monthly Assistance of 1,300 Yuan</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence. The Wuhu Shipping Association's Steamship Department reported that the steamships of various companies in Wuhu travel the Yangtze River to Nanjing and Anqing, and the inland rivers to Hefei and Chaoxian, etc. There are many passengers and many goods. At this time of rampant banditry, robberies and injuries are often heard along the way. Since last autumn, after submitting a request to the Wuhu Military School General Team to send soldiers to escort the ships, the results have been remarkable. The association, considering the safety of travelers and the lives at stake on each ship, and for the sake of a permanent solution, has now resolved by all shipping merchants to submit a request to the Second District Administrative Commissioner's Office and Security Command to send 80 soldiers on a long-term basis, divided into ten shifts, to be responsible for security on the above three lines. In addition to raising 4,000 yuan from the shipping merchants to purchase 25 guns to assist the military, they will also raise 1,300 yuan per month for pay and clothing. If the soldiers' shifts are stopped, their food rations will be stopped, and their pay will be calculated at 80%. After receiving the request, the Security Command approved it and ordered the 4,000 yuan for purchasing arms and 1,000 yuan for clothing to be handed over to Deputy Commander Jiang Yaoting, who will be responsible for the preparations. It is planned to implement it from next month. (February 11)</p>
<h3 id="e87">Northern Anhui Lieshan Coal Mine Returns to Commercial Shares <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Official Share Management Suffers Heavy Losses</p>
<p>Commercial Shares Submit Request to Ministry to Take Over Responsibility</p>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence. The Lieshan Coal Mine in Su County is the most famous mine in Anhui Province, with a very rich annual output. The fuel for Jiangsu, Anhui, and Henan provinces is mostly supplied by it. The mine was initially opened by local gentry and was originally named Puyi Coal Mine Company. Later, it was seized by Ni Sichong, who added shares and expanded it, gradually developing it. By the ninth year of the Republic, business had been expanded again, raising a total of 1.5 million yuan in shares. In the sixteenth year of the Republic, the National Revolutionary Army's Northern Expedition recovered Jiangsu and Anhui. The authorities found that Ni had 600,000 yuan of shares in the mine, which was deemed to be the property of a rebel. The Ministry of Agriculture and Mining sent personnel to take over and changed the company to Lieshan Coal Mine Bureau, which was run by the government. However, due to the military situation at the time, all matters at the mine were suspended, and mining could not continue. The Ministry of Agriculture and Mining suffered heavy annual losses, and the mining business showed no signs of improvement. In the seventeenth year, non-Ni shareholders jointly petitioned the National Government to return the original mine to restore property rights. After repeated negotiations, in the eighteenth year, the Lieshan Coal Mine Bureau was abolished and changed to the Lieshan Coal Mine Co., Ltd., a joint venture between the government and commercial interests. Ni's 600,000 yuan of shares remained state-owned, while commercial shares accounted for 900,000 yuan, with a total of 1.5 million yuan in shares. After the mine was changed to a joint venture, the Ministry of Industry designated six directors each for the government and commercial shares to form a board of directors in Beijing. The board of directors would elect a general manager and an assistant manager, who would be appointed by the Ministry of Industry. However, in practice, the directors of the government shares were responsible. In recent years, due to poor management, the company has suffered considerable losses. All commercial share dividends for several years have not been paid out. General Manager Huang Jintao found it difficult to cope and felt that handling affairs was tricky, so he requested to resign. The directors of the commercial shares, considering the company's annual losses, feared that it would go bankrupt if no measures were taken to rectify the situation. They recently submitted a request to the Ministry of Industry in Beijing to have the commercial shares take over responsibility. The Ministry of Industry also believed that the government shares had not achieved any results after several years of management and that the mining business was deteriorating. Therefore, it approved the request and appointed Wu Shucai of the commercial shares as the general manager of the company and Zhou Ziheng as the assistant manager. Zhou first went to Lieshan to take over all affairs of the mine and then returned to Beijing to discuss improvement measures with Wu. It was recently heard that the board of directors of the mine held a meeting in Beijing on the 10th to retroactively approve Wu and Zhou as general manager and assistant manager to comply with the election procedures. This reorganization is purely the responsibility of the commercial shares, with no participation from the government shares. It is heard that the commercial shareholders have already raised funds. Once the internal affairs of the mine are rectified, they will purchase machinery, repair the coal and speed up mining, aiming to produce 500 tons of coal per day and promote sales as much as possible to develop the business. The general company here is in urgent need of the new general manager Wu Shucai to take over the affairs because there is no one in charge internally. The transfer procedure for the former general manager Huang has been completed and is ready for handover. (February 11)</p>

<p>The dredging of the Dajun Bridge River and the repair of the abutments of the Dajun Bridge have been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, the southern abutment of the bridge was undermined when the mud downstream of the bridge was excavated, and the stone foundation loosened. The abutment suddenly sank by several inches, causing the Sun Siquan incense shop and Zaifeng Money Shop on the abutment to tilt, posing a danger. As a result, the shops temporarily suspended business to avoid danger. The Engineering Committee then discussed remedial measures, preparing to lay concrete under the bridge. The Lian Huai Delou's houses on the abutment have been demolished and work began today (13th) to lay concrete day and night. The revetments on both sides of the bridge are also being demolished and rebuilt. The engineering work is expected to be extended. Most of the revetment wharves of the rice shops on both sides of the river have been completed, and a few businesses are automatically pouring concrete and driving wooden stakes, which can also be completed within days.</p>

On the 12th, the Anhui Provincial authorities transferred the guerrilla troops stationed in Zhenjiang, who arrived in Tongzhou aboard the Wushan wheel steamer, to proceed to Lüsi to join forces with the provincial and county police and militias to suppress the mutinying soldiers.</p>

<p>The Zhangbaling area, originally belonging to Chuzhou County, was assigned to the jurisdiction of the new Jiashan County. Previously, the merchants and residents of the area submitted a petition to the Fifth District Administrative Inspectorate, requesting that it remain under the jurisdiction of the old county. This was forwarded to the provincial government for consideration. It is now heard that the petition has been rejected and that the assignment of the fortress to Jiashan is a settled matter and shall not be altered.</p>

<p>Liao Chuliang, Director of the First Public Security Bureau, noted that bandit alarms frequently occur in the area outside the Northwest Gate, including Phoenix Bridge, Lüyang Village, and Shuangqiao, but are beyond immediate reach. It is now planned to install temporary telephones for rapid response in the event of bandit alarms. However, the cost of felling poles and installation is substantial, and efforts are underway to raise the necessary funds.</p>
<h3 id="e98">The Decline of Commerce in Huzhou and the Increase in Unemployment <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Three years ago, this city was most prosperous in the money, cloth, silk, and crepe trades. There were as many as twenty-five money shops. Due to successive years of disaster and the impact of war, financial conditions have become extremely sluggish, leading to the successive closure of various shops. Last year, Desheng, Longchang, Zhenghe, and three other shops also declared liquidation. This year, Anyu and Deyu have ceased operations. Only Deyuan, Defu, Shenyi, Qingyu, and Jiufu, five shops, are able to continue operating. Although the remaining shops have the intention to close, it may not materialize. The silk and cloth industry has also suffered greatly in recent years. Only Dafeng had a surplus of over four thousand yuan last year after deducting official interest. The remaining shops are all losing money and are implementing strict austerity measures. Silk weaving factories showed slight improvement last year, but due to weak sales, factories have excessive inventories, preventing economic circulation. After stopping work at the end of the year, it was originally planned to resume work in mid-month. However, due to the current situation, the resumption of work has been postponed indefinitely. Therefore, there are approximately more than one thousand unemployed people in various industries.</p>

<p>It was reported in the news a few days ago from Tokyo that the General Assembly of the Japan Economic Association resolved to submit a proposal to the International Chamber of Commerce Congress to prohibit economic restrictions, requesting the conclusion of an international convention to stop this tool, etc. The Guowen News Agency reporter visited an important official of the Association yesterday, who said that the issue of goods exclusion did not start today. The Japanese side wants to propose a convention at the International Chamber of Commerce Congress to stop our country's goods exclusion. Is it only now that the Japanese government and the public realize that there are still conventions in the international community? However, judging from the past and present, the glorious conventions have long been destroyed, and all principles have been obliterated. How can the passive resistance and self-defense of goods exclusion violate the conventions? It is hoped that the Japanese business community will think twice about this, it is said.</p>

<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, after the restoration of diplomatic relations between China and Russia, the commercial relations between the two countries are bound to become closer. Recently, Russian goods have been arriving in Shanghai one after another, which is already foreseeable. Given this trend, our country's industry is still in its infancy and urgently needs to be revitalized, and it is especially necessary to learn from friendly countries. Russia has made rapid progress in industry after the Five-Year Plan, and those engaged in industry should conduct inspections. Therefore, leaders of the business community in the north and south have now initiated a Soviet-Russian inspection team to go and inspect, and there is a consensus that some leaders of the business community in this city are willing to participate and hope to exchange knowledge about the economic situation of the two countries with economic figures in that country after arriving in Russia, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e105">The Shanghai-Suzhou Double Track Railway Bureau Begins Planning <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>How to Raise Funds Has Not Yet Been Determined</p>
<p>There are Many Difficulties in Reforming the Songhu Railway</p>
<p>The Ministry of Railways plans to add a double track between Suzhou and Shanghai. Minister Gu Mengyu once contacted the banking community during his previous visit to Shanghai. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency inquired about the progress of the plan from the Shanghai-Suzhou Railway Administration yesterday. The director of the General Affairs Department of the Administration, Mo Hengjian, told us the following:</p>
<h3 id="e106">Preparing a Double-Track Plan <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>According to him, this project plan cannot be implemented without careful consideration and concrete plans due to funding and other related matters. Therefore, although the Railway Administration has already started planning, it still needs expert research. In terms of funding, the cost of the rails alone is estimated to be about 4 million yuan. Due to the addition of double tracks, the increase in vehicles, the expansion of the factory, the addition of small stations, and the increase of existing stations, as well as the storage and switching of vehicles, etc., all must be carried out simultaneously in order to be effective. However, due to the close commercial relationship between Suzhou and Shanghai, it is imperative to add double tracks in order to remedy the current congestion and to plan for future prosperity. At the same time, there is also a similar plan for the Nanjing to Zhenjiang section, but the completion of the plan may still have to wait. As for future funding, whether it will be obtained through overdrafts from banks or direct loans from the banking community, the method has not yet been determined. The rumor that loans will be taken from the banking community is not only too early but also untrue.</p>
<h3 id="e107">More Than Seventy Fellow Villagers from Ningbo Suggest a "Ningbo Sojourners in Shanghai" Airplane <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>There are No Fewer Than 600,000 Fellow Villagers in Shanghai</p>
<p>One Yuan Per Person Can Buy Five Airplanes</p>
<p>Since the promotion of saving the country through aviation in this city, all sectors have responded enthusiastically, and donations for the purchase of airplanes have been increasing daily. Yesterday, more than seventy members of the Ningbo Sojourners in Shanghai Association, including Shui Xiangyun, jointly suggested to the Association to raise funds to purchase the "Ningbo Sojourners in Shanghai" airplane to donate to the government for resisting the enemy. The petition is excerpted as follows: It is submitted to suggest raising funds to purchase the "Ningbo Sojourners in Shanghai" airplane to donate to the government for resisting the enemy. The importance of the air force in national defense has already been seen during the European War. Since the January 28th Incident last year, we have felt even more that it is impossible to defend against foreign aggression without strengthening the air force. Therefore, what we have heard in this year is the slogan of saving the country through aviation, and what we have seen are the slogans of saving the country through aviation. Now, if we investigate the reason why the three small islands are able to do so, it is because, since last year, the people of that country have donated more than sixty "Patriotic" airplanes to the army and eighteen "Serving the Country" airplanes to the navy. In this regard, is it that our financial resources are not as good as theirs? However, the total losses in the Battle of Shanghai amounted to 150 million. What difficulty would there be in leveling the three islands with this money if it were used to purchase airplanes? Is it that our people's patriotism is lighter than theirs? Moreover, the Volunteer Army resisted the enemy, forgetting hunger and cold, holding old machines, and facing certain defeat, yet they repeatedly fought and were repeatedly defeated. How often has this kind of spirit been seen in them? So, what is the reason? It is that there is no organization to advocate it. The airplanes cannot be purchased by the strength of one or two civilians, so we must rely on a public-trusted organization to promote and facilitate it. The number of our fellow villagers in Shanghai is no fewer than 600,000. If the credit of our association is used to advocate it, it will definitely achieve good results. If we calculate an average donation of one yuan per person, we can get more than 600,000 yuan, which can buy four or five airplanes. The association holds the leading position among the fellow villagers associations in Shanghai. If it can advocate this, other associations will definitely follow suit in droves. Then the association's contribution will be recorded in history for posterity. Xiangyun and others are deeply concerned about the motherland and have a close relationship with their hometown. Therefore, they dare to make suggestions and respectfully ask the association to consider and implement them. The future of the country really depends on it. Respectfully submitted by members Shui Xiangyun, Lin Bingyu, Fan Caicong, Wu Tinglun, Ye Chengtong, Zhong Youlin, Lang Luceng, Cai Tongfu, Li Wenyi, Shen Zhaoqing, Zhou Zhao, Zhao Zhangyue, Jin Yuanyi, He Qinchang, Wang Jiming, Dong Zhenfu, Zhang Yinshui, and more than seventy others.</p>

<h3 id="e108">Difficulties in Reforming the Songhu Railway <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Afterwards, the reporter asked about the reform of the Songhu Railway. According to Mr. Mo, the reform of the Songhu Railway was originally suggested by Director Huang when he was in the Public Works Bureau. Currently, the railway has 14 trains per day, which is ten fewer than before the war. The reason is partly that the vitality of Wusong has not recovered after the war, and partly that all the steam cars were damaged during the war and have not yet been restored. However, after the city center area is realized in the future, the transportation of the Songhu Railway will still be an important position. Reform is also a necessity in fact. However, how to reform and how to proceed is worth studying. It can be reformed on the original basis, or it can be independent. As for vehicles, if diesel cars are used, they can indeed reduce gas and wind and waves. However, diesel engines and diesel oil must still be purchased from abroad, which inevitably adds another opportunity for foreigners to make a profit. Whether this benefit to foreigners is beneficial to the country should also be carefully considered. Coal is still available in our country. If diesel is used, it is completely necessary to purchase foreign goods. Therefore, there are still many difficulties in this plan, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Problems with Zhenru Station, etc. <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>The Zhenru joint transport station must wait until explanations are given to various sectors before it can proceed. The renovation and reform of the two-way vehicles cannot be carried out at present because there are no replacement vehicles to be transferred for repair. When there are vehicles that can be transferred, it can be started. Direct exchanges between Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo are currently inconvenient for both freight and passengers due to the obstruction of the Qiantang River to the Cao'e River. Therefore, the Qiantang River Bridge has been planned to be implemented as soon as possible to facilitate transportation and smooth freight. As for the current sale of the North Station, it is rumored that someone is competing to sell it. However, it is not the time to do so before the temporary station on Song Park Road is completed. The land area of the North Station was destroyed during the war due to the original Mu list. In the future, the Land Bureau will need to remeasure it. It should be around 700 Mu, and the price per Mu is about 30,000 taels. However, this has not yet been determined.</p>

<p>The China Aviation Association began working at its new address at 99 Jessfield Road yesterday. Wang Xiaolai, the standing director of the Association, went to the office around 4:00 p.m., and was guided by Secretary Chen Chengzhi to observe each room. He was very satisfied and then left. The recent situation of the Association is divided as follows:</p>
<p>Standing Committee Meeting: The standing committee meeting of the Association this week has been scheduled to be held on Wednesday (the 15th) afternoon to discuss various matters. The detailed organization and methods of the recruitment team can also be submitted for discussion at that time.</p>
<p>Continued Receipt of Donations: Yesterday, the Association received donations totaling 300 yuan from all the colleagues of the Sanbei Company Xinning Xing. The donation from the steamboat colleagues is the first of its kind. It also received 14 yuan from the colleagues of the Hengbao Steamboat Company. The children's donation was donated by Qian, a boy from the Fine Arts Handkerchief Factory, Sun Biangsheng, Junwei, Xinsheng, a girl Zhicheng, Xicheng, and donated candy fees of ten yuan. Mao Sibai and Simaimei donated two yuan together. The No. 1 Machine of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce donated 14 yuan from colleagues of the Fine Arts Printing House, 2 yuan from An Huifang, and 1 yuan each from Yu Yongchang, Xuan Jiusong, Wang Qixiang, Wang Dekui, Peng Lian, Zhang Hanlu, Xu Guorong, Mao Huiquan, Dai Hongkui, Xue Changxin, Feng Zengrong, Zhou Suisheng, and Qian Zhongren, Chen Xiaoliang, and four apprentices from the Huali Shoe Room.</p>

The Chinese Preparatory Committee has appointed Guo Weibai, the director of the association's affairs, to go to the United States to arrange it. The Ministry of Finance has allocated funds. It is heard that Guo will set off for the United States as soon as the Ministry of Finance remits the funds. His task is to prepare for the construction of the Chinese Pavilion and to negotiate on the rental of the pavilion area.</p>

The consistency of faith and action is the general principle of the group. Next, Weng Guodong read the previous record, and Zhong Zifeng, who came to Shanghai from Beiping, reported on the situation of contacting and preparing the Ten-Person Group in Beiping. Next, the chairman read the draft articles of association, and the public had no objection. Next, the proposal 1. The case of issuing publications was to promote the three gentlemen Zhao Jinqing, Luo Yunyan, and Fan Dingjiu to plan, with Dr. Luo Yunyan in charge of the draft. 2. The Shanghai Church Leaders Conference will be held at the Shanghai YMCA in the French Concession on the afternoon of February 25. Next, Fan Dingjiu prayed, and the chairman treated everyone to dinner, and they dispersed happily.</p>

<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the ice-fresh fish industry, the salted fish industry, and the cured meat industry associations yesterday, asking them not to undertake sales of counterfeit inferior fish. The letter stated: Sirs, on the 11th of this month, we received a letter from overseas Chinese in Canada signed by one of the Chinese nationals, stating that there is now a large batch of Japanese salted fish, commonly known as Qingchuan fish in Shanghai, totaling more than one thousand boxes, which have been repackaged as British goods to come to China. The boxes are printed with British salted fish and B.A.C. and other words. Although the fish are Canadian seafood, the fishermen are also Japanese thieves, and the sellers are all Japanese slaves. It is the same as renaming the Japanese fish Russian salmon. The offending fish have been loaded on the Canadian vessel Victoria ABYOFVictoria to Shen, and will arrive in Shanghai around February 20. However, we have witnessed the Japanese slaves personally caring for the ship and stamping the boxes. The Japanese slaves are subject to our country's strong restrictions, so they have to think of other ways to repackage and change their names to deceive us Chinese people. We have witnessed it and must inform our compatriots, lest you patriotic gentlemen be deceived by them. Therefore, we first drafted this letter to respectfully inform you, and then ask you to warn the Shanghai Fish Trade Association and the local people of Shanghai. Please everyone save some last blood and show some conscience. Do not seek small profits and be greedy for cheap things, and forget national hatred. Unanimously refuse to buy, etc. After investigating and stating each section, it does not seem to be fabricated out of thin air. Since the ship will arrive in Shanghai around the 20th of this month, the more than 2,000 boxes of counterfeit inferior fish will naturally have to be sold by the fish traders in this city on their behalf. In addition to sending separate letters, the facts are notified to you to check and strictly warn your colleagues. When the inferior fish arrive, do not say that you are buying them. This is the most important thing.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Feng Zhanhai and Xiao Zhenying Send Telegrams to the Support Association Urging Relief <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>The Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association received telegrams from Feng Zhanhai and Xiao Zhenying yesterday, begging for assistance. It is heard that the Support Association, with limited current donations, earnestly hopes that all sectors will donate 30,000 yuan within a week so that they can be distributed to various armies in Rehe to boost morale and benefit the killing of the enemy. The two telegrams are divided as follows:</p>
<p>Feng Zhanhai's Telegram (Titles Omitted): Our divisions, the 1st, 4th, 5th, and 4th routes, have completed their deployment to the Fuxin defense line, and are united with the Suidong defense line. The sixteen brigades and four detachments plan to go to command and vow to drive out the rebellious captives. I am alone thinking of the officials and soldiers Yu Huan Cheng and others, informing all sectors that Please Do Not Provide Wu Dehai with the Identification Materials Solicited by</p>
<p>Yu Huancheng and others are writing to the public and private institutions, organizations, and writers of the country regarding the solicitation of manuscripts by Wu Dehai (H.G. Woodhead) for editing the Chinese Yearbook. Of the foreign Chinese living in China, the most famous for anti-China is actually Mr. Wu Dehai. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese dispute, Wu Dehai published anti-China and pro-Japanese remarks, repeated in length, absurd and unwarranted, not only by the Chinese people Cut teeth 鈪</p>
<p>Even foreigners who are slightly rational are angry and cannot calm down. If China is a country with complete ruling power, then a madman like Wu Dehai cannot be allowed to stay on this land. Unfortunately, China is a weak country under the aggression of imperialism. Therefore, Wu Dehai, who is supported by China, dares to blatantly be an enemy of China. This is not only the great shame of the Chinese people, but also the current system The current situation of darkness. Wu Dehai once published a Chinese yearbook in English, the information of which, in addition to taking materials from the customs report, is mostly provided by various institutions and writers in our country. Wu Dehai is Wu Dehai. The Chinese yearbook is really powerful. Now Wu Dehai has issued a notice requesting various agencies to provide information for the editing of the 1933 Chinese Yearbook. Fellow people think that if the Chinese people have a conscience, they will never want to work for Wu Dehai again. Furthermore, the Sino-Japanese disputes in the past year will be one of the important materials for the yearbooks. When Wu Dehai describes this matter, he will inevitably continue his usual anti-China and pro-Japanese attitude and add unwarranted ugliness to China. If the works of the Chinese people and the works that slander China are listed in the same book, is it equal to acquiescing to Mr. Wu Dehai's absurd remarks and being with the enemy? How can we stand on our own? For this reason, I respectfully ask all public and private institutions, organizations, and writers in the country to strictly reject Wu Dehai's request for providing information. If it has been issued, it should be returned as soon as possible to show the meaning of the enemy. , so that Wu Dehai and his associates will know to be vigilant, Yu Huancheng, Li Quanshi, Zhang Naiqi, Sun Huairen, Xie Liuyi, Yu Songhua, Wu Feidan, Wang Boxiang, Ling Qihan, Zhang Zisheng, Xu Tiaofu, Chen Binhe, Yang Xingzhi, Chen Gengya, Fu Donghua, Tang Gongxian, Hu Yuzhi, Zhu Boying, Qian Xiaoqiu, Wu Shou Gong, Song Yunbin, He Bingsong, Gu Binglin, Zou Yuntao, Zheng Zhenduo, Du Ruo</p>

<p>The suffering is so striking, I humbly ask you to provide assistance within the possible scope to boost morale. I am extremely grateful, Feng Zhanhai bowed, steamed.</p>
<p>Xiao Zhenying's telegram (titles omitted): The anti-Japanese atmosphere here is extremely tense. Song Zheyuan and other troops have all arrived on the Yuguan front, and their morale is high. They are determined to have me invincible. However, although Li Du of Jilin has temporarily retreated to Russian territory, his subordinates and Wang Delin's troops continue to fight and fight to the death with the Japanese pirates in Sanji. However, in terms of materials, it is extremely lacking. Mr. and others, with your patriotic enthusiasm, have always been expected by the public. I respectfully ask you to grant your support and raise a large sum of money so that the anti-Japanese warriors can achieve their success and recover the lost land. This is all thanks to Mr. and others. The electricity is soaring, and I respectfully ask for your teaching, Brother Xiao Zhenying bows, Jia.</p>

<p>A telegram came from Rehe saying that I have just received a telegram from Kai Lu Commander Cui 亥, stating: "Greetings to the Mo Border. The police have been repeatedly warning, and there is a situation that is about to break out. Check that Kai Lu is a county, which is extremely important. Once it is lost, the country will be shaken. Xinwu was ordered to defend here, and has always been responsible for defending the territory and resisting foreign bandits. Today's war is incomparable to the past. In the era of scientific warfare, machinery accounts for seven, eight, and labor accounts for only two, one, and three. Now we only have 3,000 rifles to deal with the enemy's artillery, aircraft, tanks, armored vehicles, and machine guns. I am afraid that the flesh and blood of the body are limited, and the enemy's artillery fire is endless. If the loss of a brigade's force is sacrificed in advance, the mistakes to the country are great. Whenever I think of this, I can't sleep or eat. Xinwu has been serving on the border for a year, and there have been no less than dozens of battles, large and small. There is no slight supplement to the important weapons. Bullets and military salaries are hopeless. Your Excellency, with the national reputation, took the lead in saving the country, and must have thoroughly considered and audited the above sections.

<h3 id="e116">The Enthusiastic Donation to Righteous Armies From All Walks of Life <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>The Colleagues of the Changsha Commercial Press - Support Association for the Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe Volunteer Army, received a letter yesterday from colleagues at the Changsha branch of the Commercial Press. It stated, "Respected Sirs, The Japanese act tyrannically and recklessly, seizing our Eastern Provinces and occupying our Yu and Jiu regions. Fortunately, the loyal and courageous Volunteer Army bravely and resolutely confronts the enemy. However, they are plagued by hunger, cold, and a lack of firearms and ammunition. Once support fails to continue, it will be difficult to sustain their efforts for long. We colleagues, recognizing this and unwilling to stand idly by, have frugally saved money from food and clothing, as well as from New Year's banquets, and have collectively gathered 105 yuan and 3 jiao in silver. This amount has been remitted through the Changsha Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank. Enclosed with this letter is a list of the names of the donors. Please verify and acknowledge receipt."</p>
<p>Qi Dong Merchant Huang Xiuzhai: Huang Xiuzhai, a prominent merchant from Qidong, hosted a wedding banquet for his eldest grandson, Guandong, at the end of last year. He received many gifts from relatives and friends. This spring, he originally intended to host a return banquet. However, upon reflecting on the fact that the Volunteer Army in the Northeast is valiantly defending the country but lacks sufficient food and clothing, he felt deeply moved. He specifically allocated 200 yuan from the banquet budget to aid the military expenses, transforming extravagance into a worthy cause. Such a man as Mr. Huang can truly be called a patriotic enthusiast.</p>
<p>The Hardware Industry Generously Donates a Large Sum: The Northeast Volunteer Army lacks a medical rescue team, resulting in wounded soldiers being left untreated, groaning on the battlefield in immense suffering. Currently, over sixty patriotic comrades from Zhenjiang are willing to go to the front lines to undertake medical rescue work. However, they lack the funds for travel, medicine, and medical supplies. Mr. Zhang Zilian of the Samsung Cotton and Iron Factory in this city dispatched someone to verify the situation and confirm its authenticity. Therefore, during yesterday's meeting of the Copper, Iron, and Machinery Industry Association, he raised a request for assistance. Twenty-four fellow businesses, including Xinmin, Wanchang, Xiangfeng, and Jinchangxiang, jointly pledged to donate 600 yuan, demonstrating the enthusiasm of the nation in supporting the Northeast Volunteer Army.</p>
<h3 id="e117">The Municipal Government Prepares to Levy Land Value Tax <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the land tax that this city originally intended to levy has been ordered by the central government to be changed to a land value tax. Yesterday, according to a spokesperson for the municipal government, the municipal government has now received an order from the central government stating, in brief, that the land value tax in this city can be levied immediately. The method of levying should be submitted to the Ministries of Finance and Interior for review and discussion before a reply is issued and the order is executed. The municipal government believes that the tax is a new creation, and the preparation procedures are particularly complex. Therefore, it has instructed the Bureaus of Finance and Land to plan immediately. The levying will commence as soon as the order is received.</p>
<h3 id="e118">The Dispute Between the Sugar Industry and Other Merchants, Direct Negotiation Was Ineffective <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>The Focus Remains on the Conversion Standard</p>
<p>The Sugar Industry Believes That Others Are Presumptuous</p>
<p>Other Merchants Have Submitted a Request to the Government to Prohibit</p>
<p>There Is No Choice But to Seek Other Solutions</p>
<p>The Sugar, Northern Goods, and Other Merchants United Market and the Sugar, Northern Goods, and Other Merchants are in disagreement with other merchants regarding the conversion of the new standard scale. Direct negotiation failed the night before. Other merchants have reported to the competent authorities requesting prohibition. Details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Negotiation Fails: Other Merchants Association and Sugar Industry Association negotiated on the method the night before. Representatives Zheng Zenan, Jiang Zhenbang and others from the sugar industry insisted on the 85% discount based on the government order to implement the new standard scale and the joint market resolution regarding the conversion method. Representatives Gong Jingyan, Ni Fu, etc. of the other merchants believed that the new standard scale should have an 84% discount when converted with the traditional scale. After a long period of debate, no results were achieved and the meeting dispersed.</p>
<p>Opinions of Both Sides: A reporter from the New Voice Newspaper visited committee members from both the sugar industry and other merchants. 1) Representatives from other merchants, Ni Fu, etc., stated that the traditional scales were 14 taels and 4 qian, while the new standard scales were 13 taels and 6 qian and 4 fen, a difference of 95%. The sugar industry's 85% conversion rate should be changed to 84%, and the northern goods' 88% conversion rate should be changed to 87%. Other industries such as washing medicine have already implemented these changes, otherwise they should be handled according to the old rules. Furthermore, this case should not be handled by the united market because members of the united market are mostly from the sugar industry and the northern goods industry. 2) Sugar industry representatives such as Zheng Zenan stated that the actions of other merchants are using the excuse of arguing over industry regulations and forcing the sugar industry to stop trading, which is regrettable. The change to the standard scale is based on the instructions of the Social Bureau. The 85% discount is actually in accordance with the resolution of the united market. Therefore, the sugar industry has implemented the change to the new system starting January 26th. The united market notified the other merchants of this resolution as early as October 30th of last year. The other merchants did not raise any objections within the acceptance period. Now, at the time of implementation, they suddenly raise objections, which is just causing trouble for themselves and others. The sale of sugar to this street only accounts for less than 10% of the total. Since the Shanghai war was resolved, the sugar in various other stores has been purchased from their own merchants. Therefore, their purchase from the sugar industry is even smaller. Therefore, if other merchants want to stop trading, they are presumptuous and can still operate as usual. The sugar industry believes that since the new system has been promoted, it is difficult to change it again. Otherwise, with the large number of sugar customers in Shanghai, it will cause a domino effect. Therefore, no matter what, the sugar industry cannot change the current new system. Regarding the shortening of the bank draft period and the pound sterling period, due to the high price of gold in recent years and the sudden increase in taxes, the price of sugar has doubled compared to the past. If the bank draft period is too long, the risk is too great and it is difficult to turnover funds. Therefore, it is necessary to shorten it to provide support. As for the use of bank drafts, it was originally a fixed rule. The acceptance of checks in recent years has been lenient and accommodating. Now, in view of the fact that the checks paid by other merchants for sugar in recent years have often been untrustworthy, and the sugar industry has suffered a lot, it has no choice but to decide to accept bank drafts in order to ensure the safety of the funds. If the association can guarantee the trustworthiness of the checks of its members, the sugar industry may still be willing to negotiate.</p>
<p>Request for Prohibition: The Other Merchants Association submitted to the Social Bureau and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, stating that they are requesting to be prohibited from changing the discount rate. They have been buying goods from merchants using traditional scales, and the standards and discounts for goods have been set. On January 26th of this year, they received a notice from the Sugar, Sea, North-South Miscellaneous Goods United Market that all industries should change to standard scales from that day onwards. It is the law that all industries should obey the standard scales. The sugar industry and the northern goods industry claim to be changing to standard scales, but in reality, they are still operating under the old rules, maintaining the 96% discount. After repeated consultations, they have not been approved. The northern goods industry secretly ordered runners not to put goods on the market, monopolizing the market. They should be held responsible for this. Under these adverse circumstances, the merchants in various shops have no goods to buy and have no choice but to seek other solutions in order to awaken the other party. Therefore, they are submitting this document to request the authorities to quickly prohibit the two industries and order them to set another scale discount, which should be handled in accordance with the established rules of each industry in order to maintain commercial difficulties.</p>

The company's business policy is to fully promote Chinese merchant insurance and protect the interests of policyholders, hoping that various industries will promote it extensively in order to regain rights. The following important cases were then discussed and resolved: 1) In the future, all types of insurance in various industries should, as far as possible, be entrusted to the General Insurance Managers Office of various industries in Shanghai for handling. 2) Various types of insurance in various industries that were previously managed by foreign merchants should be gradually transferred to Chinese merchants in the future. 3) All industries should be notified to organize insurance branch management offices, named as (General Insurance Managers Office of Various Industries in Shanghai, Branch Management Office of a Certain Industry), etc.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Negotiations Will Commence Between the Two Parties After the Collision Between the Ningbo and Taiping Ships <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>There are Continued Requests for Compensation from Ships Involved</p>
<p>After the collision between the Taiping ship of the Taigu Company and the Ningbo ship of the Zhongwei Company, the two parties will conduct negotiations. The families of the victims have requested compensation, and there are continued requests for compensation from civilian ships damaged in the collision. Details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Negotiations Between the Two Parties: After the two companies, Taigu and Zhongwei, sent surveyors to jointly investigate the ship damage the day before, the damage to the Taigu ship was heavier than that to the Ningbo ship. Yesterday, the repairs to the Taiping ship were put out to tender, and the British-owned Yesong Shipyard won the bid to repair it. The price is 1,450 taels, and the deadline is five days, starting today. It is heard that the Zhongwei Company has hired a notary public and will submit reasons to negotiate with the Taigu Company within days. It is also heard that the Taigu Company will also hire a notary public to determine the responsibility for the collision.</p>
<p>Request for Compensation: There were also Chen Qilang's civilian ship, Kong Fuyuan's sand ship, and Ye Ruicheng's sand ship, etc., which were affected, requesting the two companies to compensate for the losses. In addition, there was the boatman Hu Yuxiang, 23 years old, from Yancheng, who made a living by rowing boats. The sampan he was rowing that day was No. 1190. The boat cracked and sank, and he fell into the water on the spot. His body has not been found. Yesterday, his wife, Yang, sent a letter to the Zhongwei Company requesting compensation.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Representatives of Steamships Petitioned Yesterday <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the Tragedy of the Wusong Steamer</p>
<p>The Wusong steamer of the British-owned Taigu Company had a tragedy. Despite repeated mediation by party and government agencies, it has not yet been resolved. Yesterday, 37 steamships, including Anqing, Gonghe, Ruihe, Suzhou, Changsha, Nanyang, Xinming, and Jihe, sent representatives Lu Shuangxi, Song Dingxun, Zhao Jianquan, Jiang Youqing, etc., with a petition to the municipal government, requesting that they forward it to the party and government agencies in Hankou to guarantee that they could resume work as soon as possible. Zhang Yinyu, a staff member of the First Section of the Municipal Government, received them. First, the petition representatives stated their intentions and submitted the petition. Mr. Zhang replied that the case had been transferred by the central government to the Hankou Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government for handling and advised the representatives to wait quietly for a resolution. The petition is recorded below: We respectfully request that the Hankou Municipal Party and Government agencies guarantee the resumption of work for the workers. The Wusong steamship violated the previous reconciliation record No. 225, violently expelled workers, and caused a tragedy. The details of what happened have been reported to your government for strict negotiations. Subsequently, the British-owned Taigu Company instigated detectives to obstruct the resumption of work for the workers. We have submitted another document to request that you forward it to the Hankou Municipal Government to guarantee the resumption of work according to the agreement. However, the time has been delayed until now, and we have not been approved. For this reason, we are jointly submitting a follow-up petition, requesting your review and approval, and that you immediately forward the reconciliation record and relevant documents related to this case to the Hankou Municipal Government to handle it according to the agreement and guarantee the resumption of work. This will be a great benefit. We respectfully submit this to the Municipal Government.</p>
<h3 id="e122">It Is Difficult to Increase Postage for Southeast Asia <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of increasing postage for the Southeast Asian Islands and the Federated Malay States, the amount proposed by the General Post Office of this city is to increase the rate for each letter weighing over 20 grams from 5 cents to 12.5 cents. After submitting it to the Ministry of Communications, due to the impact on the burdens of overseas Chinese, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission was immediately consulted. Yesterday, according to a person in charge of the post office, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, after receiving the letter from the Ministry of Communications, convened a standing committee on the 11th to discuss it. The result was that increasing postage to the Southeast Asian Islands and the Federated Malay States would have a significant impact on the livelihoods of overseas Chinese. Moreover, in this era of commercial depression, the daily hard work of overseas Chinese is still insufficient to pay local taxes and miscellaneous expenses. How can they bear the burden of increased postage from their home country? Therefore, they have replied to the Ministry of Communications, firmly opposing it. It is expected that this issue will be difficult to implement.</p>

<h3 id="e125">The Case of Li Yushan of Shashi Textile Company is Awaiting Further Hearing <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>If Li Fails to Appear, an Arrest Warrant Will Be Issued</p>
<p>The Shashi Textile Company was established in Shashi, Hubei Province, three years ago and is operating quite well, with profits of hundreds of thousands of yuan. For the convenience of its shareholders, the company has established a Shanghai office at 3 Sanhe Lane, Jiangxi Road, with General Manager Li Yushan holding exclusive power. For the past three years, shareholder and board meetings have never been convened as required to report on business conditions, issue dividends, or distribute bonuses. One of the shareholders, Yin Geru, holds shares worth 10,000 yuan. Since he has neither received dividends nor interest, he sold his shares last December and demanded over 5,000 yuan in dividends and interest from Li. Li refused to pay a single penny and, together with the accountant Yu Yingle, insulted Yin. Yin sued them, and the First Special District Court found the accusations to be true, giving Li and Yu a light punishment as a warning. In addition to this case, Yin also filed a criminal lawsuit against Li personally, accusing him of embezzlement, fraud, and falsifying accounts. A preliminary hearing has already been held, as reported previously. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu Tingqi of the First Special Court held another hearing. The defendant Li Yushan did not appear, only his defense lawyer. The lawyer stated that the case is currently being mediated by Du Shaoru, the chairman of the Shashi Company, and requested a postponement. However, the plaintiff Yin Geru denied the mediation. The plaintiff's lawyer stated that the defendant Li Yushan is actually evading justice. Although the defendant has published a rebuttal in the newspaper regarding the four charges made by the plaintiff, it only makes his desire to cover up his actions more obvious. The witness summoned, Gao Jiaren, the executive director of the company, has already appeared and should be questioned. Witness Gao testified that the Shashi Company was established three years ago and is operating profitably. No board meetings were initially held. A meeting was held yesterday, but he did not attend due to a throat ailment. However, he heard that the accounts have not yet been cleared and that dividends have never been issued. He was aware that Yin Geru subscribed to shares, but he did not know that Yin sold his shares until Yin demanded dividends from Li Yushan, and a dispute ensued. Judge Wu then ordered that the hearing be postponed to the afternoon of the 17th of this month and that the defendant Li Yushan be summoned to appear for further questioning. If he continues to evade justice, an arrest warrant will be issued.</p>

<p>Kong Abao, a 34-year-old man from Suzhou, a resident of 318 Dalin Road in Nanshi, was careless while cooking breakfast on the mezzanine at around 10 AM yesterday. In an instant, the fire intensified, piercing the roof and spreading to the corner buildings at 1, 2, and 3 Fangxiehou Road, the Shaxunxing Bamboo Shop opened by Chen Wangshi of Zhoujiaham, Pudong Dragon King Temple. Fortunately, the police officers from the Tangjajie Police Station of the Second District General Administration of the Municipal Public Security Bureau heard the news and immediately reported to the fire brigades, which rushed to the scene to put out the fire with all their strength. The fire was extinguished in about half an hour. It is estimated that four flat houses were burned. At the time, nearby residents were moving and grabbing boxes and luggage, causing great chaos. The Second District Patrol Officer and other police officers arrived at the scene to suppress the situation, but the arsonist had already escaped without a trace. Only Chen Wangshi and Tang Jinsheng were arrested and taken to the police station for questioning.</p>

<p>County Magistrate Yan Instructs the District Head to Investigate</p>
<p>Hua Bishu, the township head of Yinghu Township in Minhang District, has been accused by citizens such as Jiang Dangsheng of the township of engaging in malpractices in the purchase and sale of land, failing to establish official contracts, arbitrarily writing consolidation certificates, and underreporting land prices to embezzle deed taxes. This was reported to the Shanghai County Government, and County Magistrate Yan ordered the district head to strictly investigate. After many days, Hua Bishu learned of this and wrote a letter claiming to represent the district head's intentions, forcing the landholders on both sides of the transaction to sign, intending to shift the blame. The landholders refused to sign and jointly submitted a petition to the Shanghai County Government, stating the facts. After receiving the petition, County Magistrate Yan again instructed the district head to investigate and report fairly.</p>

<p>Only About 500 Selected from 2,000 Submitted Photos and Negatives</p>
<p>Photos of Chinese Border Regions and the Dunhuang and Yungang Grottoes are Most Valuable</p>
<p>丨Setting a New Record for Chinese Photography Exhibitions丨</p>
<p>The China Travel Service was commissioned by the Chicago Exposition Preparatory Committee to collect Chinese photography exhibits for display in the United States. Mr. Chen Xiangtao, the director of the service, considered this matter to be of great importance to international prestige. He specifically assigned responsible personnel to collect the exhibits and invited contemporary celebrities to form a committee to guide and judge the works. After three months of preparation, the project is nearing completion. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Preparatory Process: At the beginning of the preparations, Mr. Chen Xiangtao, the director of the service, invited contemporary celebrities Cai Yuanpei, Ye Gongchuo, Chu Minyi, Xia Jingguan, Zheng Wuchang, Lang Jingshan, Chen Wanli, Guo Shuliang, Jiang Xiaojian, Shao Xunmei, Wang Xiaoting, and Mrs. Schubert to be members of the committee. Fortunately, they all generously accepted. After several meetings, the photography collection event was divided into seven groups to handle: (1) Famous scenic spots and landscapes in various places, (2) Historical sites and cultural relics with historical or artistic value, (3) Famous buildings, both ancient and modern, (4) Various modern new constructions, (5) Items and customs that can be used for academic reference, (6) Fine art photography works, (7) In addition to the above regulations, excellent works may be selectively adopted. Once the outline was determined, solicitations were sent to various institutions, groups, and individuals. A reception was once held for photographers in the local area, and several meetings were held, all chaired by Mr. Ye Gongchuo. Mr. Ye considered this matter to be related to international honor and solicited from all parties in his personal capacity, so the results exceeded expectations. This is especially appreciated by the service.</p>
<p>List of Exhibitors: The institutions that participated in this solicitation included the Guangzhou, Hankou, and Qingdao Municipal Governments, the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Works, the Qingdao Agricultural and Forestry Office, the Port Authority, the Observatory, the Ministry of Railways, the Ministry of Communications, the International Telegraph Administration, the Zhejiang Provincial Highway Bureau, the Bureau of Entomology, the National Economic Council, the National Road Construction Association, and others. Groups included the Guangzhou Far East Pictures and News Agency, the Jiaxing Photography Society, the Songjiang Huating Photography Society, various universities, and major photography studios in various ports. Individuals included Chu Minyi, Li Wenji, and Huang Ying in [Nanjing]; Li Yaosheng, Zhao Cheng, and Sun Weikuan in [Beiping]; Chen Jiazhen and Li Lansun in [Jinan]; Su Zhuying, Liu Yunxiu, Yuan Shuhuang, and Hu Zhujiang in [Qingdao]; Zhang Jingbo and Lu Yucang in [Henan]; Xiang Huian in [Zhenjiang]; Wu Zhongxing and Zhuang Zenghu in [Changzhou]; Chen Wanli, Zhong Zhenxin, and Zhai Peiqing in [Hangzhou]; Yang Peng and Yan Yushi in [Hunan]; Xia Shaoqiu in [Wenzhou]. In this area, there were Fu Bingchang, Gan Naiguang, Lang Jingshan, Lin Jin, Zhou Jianqiao, Feng Sizhi, Ruan Siqi, Wang Yuhuai, Tong Bo, Chen Rentao, Zhang Mingguang, Cao Zuguang, Su Jinyuan, Huang Lianzhang, Chen Zhili, Chen Yuansu, Shen Yan, Wang Dafo, Hu Xianyun, Gu Bowei, Shu Xincheng, Shao Yuxiang, Zhang Pansun, Mo Tianxiang, Zhang Daqian, Zuo Gengsheng, Huang Zhongchang, Liu Xucang, Xu Zuyin, Chen De, and over a hundred others. A total of over a thousand photos and over eight hundred negatives were received. The work of enlarging the negatives was handled by Mr. Lang Jingshan, and the rest was handled by Mr. Zhang Ruiliu, a famous photographer at Watson's, so each photo is very exquisite and impressive.</p>
<p>Brief Summary of Contents: The content of the photography exhibits is mostly fine art, followed by famous scenic spots and historical sites. Among them, the most valuable are the photos of Manchuria, Qinghai, Tibet, Mongolia, Gansu, Xinjiang, and other border regions, which are mostly unseen by outsiders and are very difficult to obtain. There are also many photos related to academic aspects, such as Yungang stone Buddhas and Dunhuang murals. After repeated evaluations and summaries by the committee, only over five hundred points were selected for inclusion.</p>
<p>Mounting Work: The service also paid special attention to the mounting work. The cardboard used is Chinese gold, which is very elegant. An English description is embedded in the frame. Mr. Lang Jingshan is currently working with the service staff day and night to complete the frames. It will be completed within a day or two.</p>
<p>Scheduled Exhibition: The Chicago Expo Preparatory Committee is scheduled to open the exhibition at the Academia Sinica on the 18th of this month. These photography exhibits will also be sent for display at the same time. However, due to the small space, they cannot be fully exhibited. The service plans to hold a large-scale photography exhibition at a suitable location after the end of the exhibition, displaying all the exhibits for the public to appreciate. Once the date is determined, it will be announced in the newspaper.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Verdict in the Chen Tugeng Case <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Chen Claims He Was Mistakenly Released by the Prison Guard</p>
<p>Official Questions Why He Confessed in the Second District</p>
<p>Ling Jiannan, a native of Chuansha living at 20 Ningkang Lane, West Gate, was killed by a mob hired by dismissed detective Wang Wencai and others. Chen Tugeng was apprehended at the scene. Later, he was mistakenly released from the prison and was re-apprehended. The prosecutor indicted Chen Tugeng, Huang Shaoying, and Huang Zicheng, who was accused of harboring Wang Wencai. The hearing continued yesterday with Judge Qian presiding. Chen Tugeng stubbornly denied committing the murder. Regarding his escape from the prison, he claimed that it was the prison guard's mistake and had nothing to do with him. The judge questioned why he confessed to using an axe to attack someone in the Second District, to which he claimed he had never said that and that he had been beaten. Huang Shaoying testified that he did not go to the murder scene and that he was crippled and could not commit the crime. Huang Zicheng testified that Wang Wencai was not his apprentice, that he did not know him, and that he did not harbor him. However, the deceased's mother, Ling Wangshi, brought her grandson to the court and still accused the defendants of being suspects and murderers. At this point, Prosecutor Wu appeared in court to state his opinion, saying that Chen Tugeng was apprehended at the scene, and Huang Shaoying and Huang Zicheng were accused by the plaintiff, and requested that they be sentenced according to the law. After the lawyers' defenses, the judge declared the debate closed and the verdict will be announced on the 22nd.</p>

<p>Zheng's Own Injuries Progressing Well</p>
<p>Zheng Xitang, manager of the Ping'an Shipping Company, accompanied by deputy manager Chen Yisheng and Russian bodyguard Fan Xilisaisufu, left the company's South City branch at approximately 2:00 PM on the 11th of this month after finishing their business. As they were about to board their car, several kidnappers who had been lying in wait rushed out. One kidnapper pointed a gun at Chen Yisheng and ordered him to return to the company. Chen then heard gunshots, and both Zheng and the Russian bodyguard had been shot and wounded by the kidnappers. The kidnappers failed to kidnap Zheng and fled. Zheng was taken to a hospital in the South City for treatment, and the Russian was taken to the Tongren Hospital. However, the Russian succumbed to his injuries and died. The hospital reported to the Hongkou Police Department, who sent detectives to investigate. The body was then taken to the Rou Lun Road morgue. Yesterday morning, the First Special District Court commissioned Prosecutor Guo Wei to go to the morgue to examine the body. Chen Yisheng, 41 years old, testified that as they were about to get into the car, the kidnappers rushed out and forced him back into the company. He only ran to the stairs when he heard gunshots and did not see the kidnappers' faces clearly. The driver, Zhang Xilin, also testified. Prosecutor Guo then determined that the deceased Russian, Fan Xilisaisufu, died of gunshot wounds inflicted by the kidnappers. The body was handed over to Jigu Guguinuo (transliteration) who signed for it and took it away for burial. It was also learned that Zheng Xitang himself was still at the Tongren Hospital, where he was undergoing surgery by Dr. Gao, the head of surgery. He was conscious. Yesterday morning, his son, Zheng Hao, told people that his father's injuries were progressing well and his fever had not increased. He was already drinking porridge. However, according to the doctor's orders, he could not use his brain, so he had not received any visitors in recent days.</p>

<h3 id="e138">Changbang Rice Merchants Oppose the New Six-Dou Rice Measure <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Changbang Rice Merchants Oppose Shanghai Merchants' New Six-Dou Measure, telegram reads: We believe that national legislation must conform to public opinion and long-standing customs, and that legislation and custom must exist in parallel. It has never been the case that the convenience of a few should disrupt the established system and force the majority to obey. Recently, the government has been promoting the new system of weights and measures, and merchants and people are also abandoning the old and welcoming the new in order to comply. However, Shanghai merchants have suddenly had a strange idea, taking advantage of the transition between the old and new measurement instruments, taking the opportunity to profit privately by creating a six-dou capacity measure to exploit merchants. This is neither in line with the old system nor does it violate the new measure. They use the convenience of packing and customs declaration as an excuse to deceive the government and oppress the merchants, disregarding national laws and abandoning market credit. Their means are pervasive, and their malpractice is growing. The sales of rice in Shanghai are most prosperous from Changshu, and it is most affected by this erosion. Therefore, our Changbang rice merchants vow not to recognize this private six-dou measure and will investigate the inside story. Packing and customs declaration are export operations. Those who eat rice and specialize in export operations are even more deplorable. We hereby report the facts and request that your government ministries and bureaus comply with public opinion, conduct a fair investigation and prohibit it, so as to comply with the laws and regulations for promoting measurement and enriching the people's food supply in the future. The gratitude of the merchants will be overwhelming. In addition to separate telegrams to the Ministry of Industry, the Municipal Government, and the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, we respectfully telegram Shanghai Changbang Rice Merchants Jin Weixiang et al., 250 people.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Fire on Broadway Kills People <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Five Houses and Two Floors Burned Down</p>
<p>Charred Body Suspected to Be a Missing Apprentice</p>
<p>Zou Xingji Carpentry Shop at 933 Broadway, with the workers' dormitory upstairs, had several apprentices gathered upstairs during their spare time playing card games until about 1:00 AM last night when they turned off the lights and went to sleep. Unexpectedly, around 2:00 AM, a pile of wood shavings in the room suddenly caught fire, likely caused by the apprentices carelessly discarding cigarette butts. At that time, the workers were still sound asleep and did not notice. When the fire spread and extended to the floorboards, they were awakened from their dreams. Seeing the room full of fire, with no way out, they quickly pushed open the windows facing the street and jumped down to escape, without raising an alarm. As a result, the fire spread, and when it reached the Mei Li Leather Shop at 932 next door, the owner, Xu Yongqi, noticed and quickly shouted for help. At the same time, the neighbors were awakened. However, due to the dry weather and the wind, the fire soon spread to the Fa Li Western Clothing Store at 931 and the Yuan Shuntai Steel Trunk Shop at 934 on the left. The Yi Shun Tarpaulin Shop at 935 was also affected. Seeing the fire spreading, the firefighters divided the hoses to extinguish the fire from behind, fearing that it would spread to the adjoining houses on Huaji Road. After an hour, the fire was slightly subdued, but the Maolong Tarpaulin Shop at 930 and the Fu Rongtai Antique Shop at 929 had two floors affected and burned. The windows and doors on the upper floors of 941 and 942 Yuanfang Lane on Huaji Road were also almost burned, but fortunately, the firefighters worked hard to extinguish the fire, which prevented it from being destroyed. It was not until 5:00 AM that the fire was extinguished. As a result, five houses from 931 to 935 and two floors of 929 and 930 were destroyed. Mei Li Leather Shop owner Xu Yongqi and his wife, Ms. Gu, were burned on their backs while moving items from the fire. Chen Chuanfang, 38, a cook at Zou Xingji Carpentry Shop, from Haimen, broke his right leg after jumping from the window after the fire started. They were all taken to the Tongren Hospital by the fire truck and are not in danger. After the investigation, an apprentice from Zou Xingji Carpentry Shop, named Long Gao, 17 years old, from Haimen, was missing. Later, firefighters found a charred corpse in the rubble. The limbs were broken. According to the neighbors, it was likely the apprentice, who was crushed by something while hiding and burned to death, which is also a tragedy.</p>

<h3 id="e141">Dispute over Merchant Steamship Company Seizing Fish Resolved <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Each Barrel of Fish Charged Twenty Yuan</p>
<p>Full Payment Agreed Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>The Merchant Steamship Company's Yangtze River ships' crew members loading fresh fish and the crew members receiving the water freight fee resulted in Manager Liu sending the South Wharf manager to seize the fish along with patrol officers. Ships such as the Jiangjing and others had a total of over two hundred barrels seized, causing negotiations among fish merchants in Shanghai. This matter was reported in this newspaper. It was only resolved yesterday. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Fish Merchants' Request: The fresh fish seized from ships such as the Jiangjing, Jiangxin, and Xinjiangtian by the South Wharf Manager Li on Saturday totaled more than 240 barrels. They have been deposited in the Jinliyuan Wharf warehouse for two days. The fresh goods are滞留ed and most likely to rot. Yesterday morning, representatives of various phototypesetting companies went to the Merchant Steamship Company to negotiate with Liu Hongsheng, requesting to pick up the goods first to avoid significant losses due to spoilage. The fish merchants are willing to double the freight and pay a fine of six yuan per barrel.</p>
<p>Ordered to Pay Guarantee Money: Liu Hongsheng met with the fish merchants and refused to accept the fine, saying that loading fresh goods on the ships was a business, but the procedures taken by the fish merchants were not in compliance.</p>

<h3 id="e143">Detailed Account of Xiao Xin'an's Suicide <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Thinking of Becoming an Editor in Surabaya After School Salary Reduction</p>
<p>Severing Relations with Her Brother as a Distant Cause of Suicide</p>
<p>The suicide case of Ms. Xiao Xin'an from Yixing has been reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday, a reporter from the Guowen News Agency received a letter from a friend in Ambon, Seram, reporting the details of Ms. Xiao's suicide. The account is quite detailed, and the contents are hereby provided to the press for the concern of those who care about the lady. (Above omitted.) Since the news of Ms. Xiao's death spread to various places, it has caused a sensation in the overseas Chinese community. I have made special trips to various places to investigate and learned the following about Ms. Xiao's suicide: Ms. Xiao had been working at Peide School for two and a half years and had always been on good terms with everyone. This year, the board of directors of Peide School was reorganized, and due to financial difficulties, a meeting was held to discuss ways to maintain operations. As a result, it was resolved to reduce teachers' salaries. It was considered that male teachers had family burdens and could not be reduced much, while female teachers earned and used their own money, and expenses were not large, so the salary was set at 60 guilders. Ms. Xiao's salary was originally 125 guilders, and she felt that such a large reduction was excessive and that the school's treatment was unbalanced, so she decided to leave. Later, she discussed it with Mr. Zeng, the director of studies at the school, and Mr. Zeng agreed to introduce her to the Surabaya Java Daily Telegraph as an editor. Xiao initially agreed, but two hours later, she came back to tell Zeng, "[I don't need to go to Surabaya]." Her words seemed to suggest that she had other plans, but in fact, the thought of suicide had already been decided in her heart. So, she mailed her savings of more than two hundred guilders (some say it was more than a thousand guilders) back to China and telegraphed her brother and relatives, saying, "[Do not send letters after my death]." The telegraph cost more than forty guilders. On the evening of the 15th, the lady handed a letter to the school servant, earnestly instructing him to mail it in the morning, and gave the school servant a reward of five guilders. After returning to her room, she pulled down the mosquito net from her bed, placed all her clothes and books on the ground in a circle, poured kerosene on them, and set them on fire. She then placed herself in the middle of the fire, allowing it to burn her. After a while, the fire became more intense, and she screamed in pain. The school servant heard the sound and saw the flames in the room from outside. He rushed to open the door, but it was locked. So, he knocked on the door and shouted loudly. The lady personally opened the door and let him in. At that time, the lady was completely on fire and had turned into a firebrand. The school servant was terrified at the sight and quickly fetched water to extinguish the flames. The lady calmly ordered the school servant to fetch a rattan couch for her to lie down on. At the same time, two male teachers who shared a room with the lady learned of the incident and quickly asked a doctor to come to the school to treat the lady. After examining her, the doctor said that her flesh was already charred and could not be saved, so he instructed the two teachers to quickly report the incident to the police. The lady was then taken to the hospital by car, but it was already twelve o'clock. When the police arrived at the hospital to see the lady, she was still able to speak and admitted to the police that it was suicide and that it had nothing to do with anyone else. She died at four o'clock in the morning on the 16th. After the lady's death, her brother telegraphed her from Shanghai. The telegram was signed and collected by the Kapitan. The telegram read (You are already dead, how can you send a telegram?) The lady telegraphed, telling him of her death, and her brother doubted it and questioned it. It is said that when the lady came south, her brother tried hard to stop her, and after the incident was discovered on the ship, her brother felt even more regret and wrote to her to sever their relationship. It is said that this was one of the reasons for the lady's suicide.</p>
<h3 id="e144">The First Batch of Hunan Rice is Shipped to Shanghai <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>One Million Bags to be Loaded to Shanghai in Three Months</p>
<p>The Hunan Rice Production and Sales Committee, commissioned Wang Huixian, delegated by committee members Tan Changkai and others, to come to Shanghai to discuss shipping arrangements with Sanbei and China Merchants. The shipping fee is charged at 60% of the fixed price. This matter has been reported in this newspaper. Now, the packaging contract between the two companies has been sent by the Production and Sales Committee yesterday, requesting Yu Qiaqing and Liu Hongsheng to sign it and send it back to Changsha. All the Hunan rice to be transported can be loaded to Shanghai first with one million bags in three months. The first batch of 13,200 bags, transported by the Sanbei steamer, can arrive in Shanghai today.</p>
<p>Pay the Fee and Pick Up the Fish The fish merchants followed Mr. Liu's instructions and immediately prepared the fees yesterday morning, totaling about 5,000 yuan, and sent them to the bureau as a certificate for picking up the goods. After receiving the payment, the bureau ordered the head of the Li warehouse to release the fish barrels, so the fish detained in the warehouse before 12 o'clock were completely picked up. A dispute has come to an end. Future Measures Mr. Liu convened the heads of various ships, the director of business and the owners of Jianglun ships yesterday to discuss that from now on, the transportation of fresh fish from the Yangtze River should be declared as ordinary passenger and cargo, and the bureau should issue a bill of lading. The fish should be picked up with the bill of lading when it arrives in Shanghai, turning private into public and eliminating smuggling. However, in consideration of the short wages of the sailors, five cents of ocean per barrel of water feet will be taken out and distributed to the sailors. In the future, if any private transport is found, it will be confiscated and heavily fined. At the same time, it was agreed that there will be two shipments of fish seedlings to Shanghai every year, which can be accommodated exceptionally. Seafood from North China and vegetables from Ningbo are also prohibited from being loaded and smuggled, so as to ensure that every drop of water returns to the public.</p>

<p>At 6 pm on August 15, 1920, a revenge shooting case by Jiangbei bandits occurred in Room 2 on the ground floor of the Fa Shang Hotel at No. 113 West Xinqiao Street, French Concession. As a result, Jiang Yizhong, Xia Yongsheng, and Mr. Xue were killed, and Zhong Ziqing was injured. The murderer escaped. Later, Jin Jiulin, inspector of the special agency of the French Concession Police, and Qian Yumin, detective, arrested the murderer Yan Jinbiao, also known as Yan Dongbo, in Tiancheng Lane, Maixi Ni Road, the next day. It was also found that Yan had robbed Huang Dingchang's South Goods Store, Qiu Zhoumao, and Shen Huating's stores three times before the incident. He was sent to the Second Special District Court for prosecution. Yan confessed that he was instructed by Li Guocheng to commit the revenge killing and committed three robbery cases. After trial, Yan was found guilty of premeditated murder and sentenced to death. He was sentenced to imprisonment for each of the three robbery cases and executed. Yan refused to accept the sentence and appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court, but the appeal was rejected. Yan still refused to accept the sentence and appealed to the Supreme Court. Li Guocheng, who instigated the crime, was arrested by the Public Security Bureau in the Chinese Concession in the winter of that year for another case. He was brought back by the Second Special Court for trial. Due to the investigation of evidence, the trial has not been concluded. It is now known that Yan's third trial appeal has been concluded by the Supreme Court. Except for a slight change in the robbery charge, the murder charge is still executed according to the original sentence. The judgment has been sent to the Third Branch of the High Court and other courts, and the police were dispatched yesterday to deliver the judgment. The death penalty will be executed soon.</p>

<p>The Greyhound Association's lawsuit against Martin, the extra general patrol of the Public Works Department, and Maikenaiden, the former chairman, continued to be heard yesterday morning at the British Court. The plaintiff's lawyer, Harris, responded to the reasons given by the defendant's lawyer for requesting the dismissal of the case, especially focusing on the defendant's lawyer's claim that the two defendants were only performing official duties and acting on the orders of the Public Works Department, and that the plaintiff must prove that the Public Works Department had violated civil law. He argued that the case was against the two defendants for violating civil law, not against the Public Works Department. The defendants are British and are under the jurisdiction of this court, so they should be sued here. He also said that when the court determines whether the Public Works Department has jointly violated civil law with the defendant, it can only be handled in accordance with British law, so the case should be heard by this court. Then, he cited similar cases as analogies.</p>

<p>A news item that the implementation of special volume measurement for export rice does not conform to the facts. After checking with the association, the capacity of each ocean money bag for export rice is suitable for six dou city volume measurement. I have submitted an application to the New System Measurement and Testing Institute of this city for testing. Six dou city volume measurement has been changed to a special volume measurement of one shi, one dou, and eight sheng. I think this is a misunderstanding of rumors. I am deeply afraid that it will easily cause misunderstandings to the outside world. I should write to your newspaper for correction to correct the audience.

<h3 id="e154">Where Does China's Illness Lie? <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>丨丨Letter from Mr. Shen Zuguang丨</p>
<p>In your response to my article [Where Does China's Illness Lie?]: ㈠ I am most satisfied that you pointed out all the shortcomings in my article, giving me something to follow. ㈡ What I am not satisfied with is that the title is [Where Does China's Illness Lie?], yet it did not mention the source of the illness, leaving me without direction.</p>
<p>You seem to suspect that I am a remnant of the old regime, but that is not the case. I am a detached observer of society. The reason I proposed the article [Monarchy and Democracy] in my previous letter was because I was so dissatisfied with the current political reality. Because the federal system has not been implemented in China, we do not know if it is good or bad. Communism is also not suitable for the modern era. It seems that there are only two paths: monarchy and democracy. In fact, this question belongs to the realm of political science. There is no absolute good or bad in politics, so others cannot be prohibited from studying monarchy and democracy. Recently, for some reason, China's intellectual circles are most afraid of discussing monarchy, as if discussing monarchy is a heinous crime! In fact, modern civilized countries are either monarchies or democracies; one of the two must be the case. As you said: [Even in the French Republic, which has gone through hundreds of years of revolutionary struggle, there are still royalists]. Then we should not prohibit the study of monarchy and democracy simply because China was formerly a monarchy and is now a republic. Nor should you suspect that I have a relationship with the young emperor of the Qing Dynasty simply because I am discussing monarchy. In fact, if China were to assume a monarchy, who among the Chinese could not be emperor, but must recognize a thief as a father, leaving the throne vacant for Puyi to take? Wouldn't that be a joke? In modern monarchies and democracies, all citizens have the right to participate in politics. What the monarch gets is only a little administrative power. However, administrative power must still be approved by parliament. In addition, there is a parliament for legislation and judges for the judiciary. The monarch is just a nominal figure, just like the cabinet under the presidential system is responsible. Therefore, modern monarchs are different from the extremely autocratic ones who relied on divine right in the past. Many people now mistakenly believe that monarchs are not bound by the constitution established by the people and have supreme authority. In fact, this is not the case in modern monarchical states. Democracy can be said to be a suitable political system in the present era. However, under the current representative system, it can no longer satisfy people as it did fifty or sixty years ago. Therefore, many scholars of international law are studying the question of [which form of government is the most superior for civilized nations]. This also shows the future trend of the world.</p>
<p>You asked me [If you don't first explain what a nation is, how can you explain whether a nation is good or bad; if you don't first explain what a government is, how can you explain whether a government is good or bad?]. I thought we should talk about facts, not theory, so I didn't say what a nation and a government are. Now, in response to your question, I respectfully offer the following definition of a nation: [A common society of one or several ethnic groups, living in a fixed territory. Not ruled by external forces, to achieve common goals; and within it, there is an organized government, with guns to protect the entire population and make them obey]. This only explains one principle. There are several other principles to explain. If we go further and talk about the origin and origin of the nation, talk about the state system, political system, and ruling power, the story will be long. By government, we certainly do not mean the federal government, because China is not a federal country. We certainly do not mean the colonial government, because China is not a quasi-colonial country. We also do not mean the local government, because our target is the central government. Originally, by government, I meant the current party government in our country. In fact, there is more than one kind of nation. There are individualistic nations, socialist nations, and communist nations. We are only speaking abstractly. That is one point.</p>
<p>You said that I said: [The reason a nation exists is because of people, and the reason people exist is to live]. That's wrong! In fact, the occurrence of human groups is nothing more than survival competition. The current politics has deprived us of all the conditions for survival competition. Can we not cry bitterly? We believe that public affairs are too important to our overall interests and actions. Whether it is in life and property, association and assembly, speech and publication, if we do not have a good government, we will not be able to live and work in peace! So-called living in peace can also include life and property; so-called working happily can also include association, assembly, speech, and publication. That is the second point.</p>
<p>You asked me: [What exactly are the various systems you mentioned? Where exactly have they been tried?]. Before the first year of the Republic of China, the call for democracy in China was very high. As a result, after the change of era, democracy was implemented. Now, may I ask, where is the spirit of democracy? This is called a failed experiment! In the second year of the Republic, Yuan Shikai declared himself emperor, wanting to restore autocratic monarchy, but Cai Songpo started an uprising in Yunnan, and Yuan Shikai fell. This is called a failed experiment! The current Central Committee system imitates the organization of Soviet Russia, but loses its effectiveness. Because the political organization of Soviet Russia is very strict, and its leaders can concentrate their power and use it freely. But our country does not have his skills, and ends up neither in heaven nor on earth. This is called a failed experiment! That is the third point. You said: [We all came from the political reforms of 1898, the Eight-Nation Alliance, the Xinhai Revolution, and the Hongxian Emperor's dream]. Precisely because we came from them, we could not come up with anything new, so I am not satisfied! The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom's revolution had good motives! It is a pity that there was a lack of talent. Except for Qian Dongping and Shi Dakai, the rest were not worth mentioning. Therefore, it did not succeed. The Yihetuan's doctrine of supporting the Qing and destroying the foreigners was pitifully naive! So there were no results. When the Qing Dynasty was overthrown and the Republic of China was established, if China had someone like Ito Hirobumi to carry out reforms, China might have already been in good shape. However, the reformers at that time had conflicting opinions. When Sun Yat-sen resigned as interim president, all new plans vanished like clouds! Then came Yuan Shikai's declaration as emperor. To be honest, I have always believed in talent. You admitted that [the Yihetuan rose up to resist imperialism, giving the imperialists a head-on blow]. This is what I doubt? If the Yihetuan really gave the imperialists a head-on blow, then China would not have made a treaty under the city during the Eight-Nation Alliance! It is necessary to know that there are two elements to establishing a nation in the world: one is military force, and the other is diplomacy. Diplomacy and military force have a mutual relationship. Now, military force is not as good as others, and diplomacy is not as good as others. Instead of cultivating talents properly, we only know how to put up slogans saying: Down with imperialism! As a result, the three northeastern provinces were taken away by others! We sought help from the League of Nations, but the League of Nations did not help! We still do not realize our past mistakes until death. There is no saving us! That is the fourth point.</p>
<p>You said: [A group of ignorant people constantly talk about history, human feelings, customs, and habits! But I want to ask, what is history? What are human feelings? What are customs and habits?]. I respectfully answer as follows: History is a common principle, and also an abstract noun. In fact, the object of history is the total statistics of people, politics, and social changes. Which country in the world today does not base its civilization history on its own evolution and narrative? This is called not forgetting one's roots. Customs are also abstract nouns. It is not said: [What the superiors transform becomes custom, and what the inferiors transform becomes habit]. My meaning of customs is: [The beliefs and lifestyles transmitted and cultivated by an ethnic society]. For example, the Japanese sitting on the floor, the Indians worshiping Buddhism, the British and Americans using knives and forks instead of chopsticks, and the Chinese formerly performing kneeling ceremonies and now bowing, these are all customs. Human feelings and habits are also abstract nouns. So-called human feelings can be explained by the will in psychology; so-called habits can be explained by exercise in psychology. For example, the Japanese occupation of the three northeastern provinces is the will of the Japanese; that is, the human feelings of the Japanese. China's resistance to Japan is the will of the Chinese; that is also the human feelings of the Chinese. Also, for example, the Chinese working class is diligent and hardworking, which is a cultivated habit; the inhuman life of black slaves in the Americas is also a cultivated habit. (Their inhumanity should be considered an exception) You should not say that history, human feelings, customs, and habits are clichés. The bigger the question in the universe, the more abstract the noun. It is clear that there are individualistic nations, socialist nations, and communist nations, but recently there is a party called the nationalist faction. What kind of nationalism does it refer to? Also, for example, the government authorities advocate long-term resistance. This is also swallowing dates whole! What year and month will the so-called long-term be? What kind of strategy will the so-called resistance use? These are all vague nouns. It is enough to seek rationality for vague nouns in logic. Abstract and concrete, analysis and generalization, seem to be irrelevant. That is the fifth point.</p>
<p>You asked me: [How exactly do you prepare? What is the so-called preparation?]. When Turkey was about to perish, Kemal emerged, convened the National Salvation Congress, produced methods to save the nation, immediately sent troops, drove back the troops of various countries stationed in Turkish territory, and restored Turkey's national fortune. This is what I mean by [prepare and you will succeed]. The government repeatedly says it will resist Japan, but it does not resist Japan. It repeatedly says it will prepare, but it never prepares. This is what I mean by [if you do not prepare, you will fail]. In fact, saying determination, saying preparation, but still no determination, no preparation, is because in reality there is still no preparation, no solution. That is the sixth point.</p>
<p>In short, what I said in my previous letter was really out of dissatisfaction with the current political reality. I still ask you to tell me where China's illness lies? What medicine should be used to cure it? (The letter will be published tomorrow)</p>

<h3 id="e157">Municipal Education Bureau Orders Private Secondary Schools to Stop Enrolling Normal School Students <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Starting from Autumn 1933</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau yesterday instructed the private secondary schools in the city, saying, "It has been found that senior secondary schools concurrently offering normal school courses were originally intended to cultivate teachers, but in recent years, private secondary schools in the city have often concurrently offered normal school courses, only to cater to the psychology of some students, without regard to their facilities. The bureau has held several registrations of primary school teachers in the city, and the statistics have reached more than 3,500 people. Therefore, the city's primary school teachers are, in fact, in surplus. Recently, Article 4 of the Law on Normal Schools promulgated by the National Government states, [Normal schools shall be established by provinces or cities directly under the Executive Yuan, but may also be established by counties or cities or jointly by two or more counties according to local needs]. According to this provision, normal schools should be public and not attached to secondary schools as a principle. Most of the private secondary schools in the city that concurrently offer normal school courses are simple and their facilities are not perfect. They should be reorganized as soon as possible. All private secondary schools in the city that concurrently operate normal school courses shall not recruit new students from the academic year of 1933 (i.e., from the autumn of 1933). Old students will continue until graduation. This has been decided by the 252nd bureau affairs meeting of the bureau on January 10th of this year, and the Ministry of Education has issued Instruction No. 978 on January 20th, approving the proposed handling. This order is hereby issued for your information." This order.</p>

<p>Hired Cai Yuanpei and others as Higher Education Research Committee Members</p>
<p>Sent Wu Xiu as a Representative to Comfort Anti-Japanese Soldiers</p>
<p>The Shanghai Education Association held its second temporary council meeting yesterday afternoon. The attendees were Xu Zeyu, Ma Jiazhen, Huang Zaoxiong, Zhang Zaibo, Wu Xiu, Chen Jicheng, Tao Baichuan, and Zhou Feicheng. Those present were Zhou Darong and others. Zhou Feicheng chaired and Chen Bangyan recorded. Formalities were observed. Matters for discussion: ㈠ Regarding the remaining funds raised by the association to assist the righteous army, it was previously resolved to remit them to the Chinese Chargé d'Affaires in Moscow, Russia, to be forwarded to Generals Su and Ma. Now, because we have not received a reply from the Chargé d'Affaires regarding whether it can be remitted, how should the funds be remitted? It was resolved to remit them to the Northeast Cooperative Association. ㈡ The standing council proposed to send a representative of the association to comfort the anti-Japanese soldiers. It was resolved to nominate Wu Xiu as the representative of the association. The association will subsidize half of his travel expenses, up to a maximum of sixty yuan. If non-members are willing to go, it will be decided by the standing council, but limited to two people, and no travel expenses will be subsidized. ㈢ Director Zheng Hongnian proposed to pass the list of research committee members for the Higher Education Research Group. It was resolved to first hire Cai Yuanpei, Ou Yuanhuai, Wang Zaoshi, Li Zhaohuan, Chen Kemei, Wang Wu, Chu Fucheng, Shu Xincheng, Wen Chongxin, Zhang Zhongdao, Zhang Jize, Sun Hanbing, Yan Fu, Hong Shen, Xu Peikun, Guo Yicen, Zhong Focheng, Chen Zhongfan, Tang Rongyi, Cao Huiqun, Li Qianruo, Zhang Shouyong, Li Dengheng, Liu Zhanen, He Shizhen, Shen Siliang, Xiao Youmei, Jiang Hongqi, Zhang Yi, Jin Nengyin, Yu Nanqiu, Liu Haisu, Yu Jifan, Guo Qiyuan, Wu Jingxiong, Yang Xingfo, He Bingsong, Wang Xishen, Weng Yulong, Zheng Hongnian, Wang Jiren, etc. as research committee members of the Higher Education Group of the association. ㈣ Director Wu Xiu's proposed measures for the schools' promotion of domestic goods lantern propaganda campaign were submitted for review and revision.

<h3 id="e159">Municipal Education Bureau Director Pan Gongzhan's Speech on Shanghai's Education (5) <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Overview of School Education and Social Education</p>
<p>According to the statistics of public and private entertainment venues in the city in January of this year, there is the following table:</p>
<p>Name Public Private Total Remarks</p>
<p>Parks Six Six</p>
<p>Sports Fields Seven One Eight</p>
<p>Golf Courses One One Located in Jiangwan, Sijing. It is a foreign-owned private facility not open to the public.</p>
<p>Miniature Golf Courses Six Six</p>
<p>Billiard Rooms One One Three One Four Public ones are affiliated with the Shanghai Municipal First Public Stadium</p>
<p>Playgrounds Five Five</p>
<p>Dance Halls Thirty-Nine Thirty-Nine</p>
<p>Peking Opera Theaters Three Three</p>
<p>Local Opera Theaters Twenty Twenty Such as Xichang Opera, Yangzhou Opera, Siming Opera, Shaoxing Opera, Su Opera, etc.</p>
<p>Ticket Offices Twenty-Nine Twenty-Nine</p>
<p>Movie Theaters Thirty-Seven Thirty-Seven</p>
<p>Drama Theaters Two Two</p>
<p>Bookstores Twenty-Two Twenty-Two</p>
<p>Others Fifteen Twenty-Five Including radio broadcasting stations, etc.</p>
<p>Total Fourteen One Hundred Ninety-Four Two Hundred Seven</p>
<p>Now, I will specifically discuss the two most common and important items, [Entertainment.</p>
<p>㈠ Regarding movies: Because Shanghai is the center of China's film industry and the largest market for foreign films in China, movies in this city have a more significant meaning for social education. The city has an organization called the Film Censorship Committee, which strictly examines all films. Regardless of Chinese or Western films, any that are harmful to social morality are either completely prohibited or partially censored, so as not to harm society. This work has been quite effective. Although it is now handled uniformly by the central government, the city authorities still strictly inspect films at any time according to orders, so that films can show a good response in social education, and absolutely prohibit the screening of all improper films that are harmful to social customs. We know that the Public Concession Board also has a film censorship organization, but I hope that they will fully cooperate with the municipal government and, under the guidance of the central government, crack down on bad films.</p>
<p>㈡ Regarding operas and records: Similarly, as with films, the Municipal Education Bureau has an Opera and Record Review Committee, which is responsible for strictly reviewing operas and records.</p>
<p>In addition, the Municipal Education Bureau pays considerable attention to all entertainment venues and advocates strictly prohibiting all harmful entertainment. This work is inherently biased towards the negative, but at the same time, there are considerable plans on the positive side. Because of the short time, I won't say much more here.</p>
<p>In short, what I have said here is all based on facts. Since the establishment of the Municipal Government, it has not been long, so all work, it can be said frankly, is still in the initial stage of construction. Although we are actively moving forward and are unwilling to make do, because of the actual difficulties, we are still very, very far from our assumed goals. Fortunately, the plan has been determined and we are more determined to build. We dare to believe that, as long as a considerable amount of time passes, the city's achievements in education will be more positive and more widespread.</p>
<p>I have roughly finished talking about the overview of school education and social education in the city. Originally, I could have finished my speech. However, now is still a time of national crisis, a very critical time. Just talking about Shanghai in terms of Shanghai, and talking about education in terms of education, we in Shanghai's education sector still feel the impact of the Japanese invasion of Songhu very strongly. All the losses are not easy to recover for a while. We only need to check the number of war losses reported by public and private schools in Shanghai to understand the extent of the impact. According to the reports received by the Municipal Education Bureau, they are as follows:</p>
<p>Level Number of Schools Amount of Loss (Silver)</p>
<p>Primary Schools 81 280,867 yuan</p>
<p>Secondary Schools 31 1,893,586 yuan</p>
<p>Higher Education Institutions 17 8,716,508 yuan</p>
<p>Total 129 10,890,961 yuan</p>

<p>To be Established at National Central University in Nanjing</p>
<p>After the Chinese Education Society elected Zheng Xigu, Liu Zhanen, Chen Heqin, and other fifteen people as directors at its first annual meeting on the 28th of last month, it has many plans for improving education. It has been reported that the society recently decided, in accordance with Article 9 of its constitution, to establish its headquarters in Nanjing and, for the convenience of office work, to be located within National Central University. All documents and files will be shipped there by the end of this month.</p>
<h3 id="e161">School News <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Kwang Hua University: Kwang Hua University has already started on the 8th. Course selection and registration were on the 9th, 10th, and 11th. Classes officially started on the 13th. The opening ceremony was held at 9 am that morning. After the ceremony, President Zhang Yongni gave a speech and reported on school affairs. Middle School Director Liao Maoru reported on the improvements in the middle school department this semester and encouraged students to study hard. It is heard that the school has hired German foreign exchange expert Dr. Geng Aide to teach domestic and foreign financial markets.</p>
<p>Shanghai Girls' High School: Shanghai Girls' High School in Nanshi held a supplementary opening ceremony at its new campus at 10 am yesterday. Those present included Pan Gongzhan from the Municipal Education Bureau, Chairman Shan Dong Lin Kanghou, Zhang Zhonghuan, secretary of Shanghai High School, He Zijian from the School for the Blind, guests Song Mingde, Lu Nan, and over 400 teachers and students from the school. Chairman Lin Kanghou conducted the ceremony as scheduled. First, the chairman delivered an opening speech, stating that the school's opening ceremony should have been held earlier, but it was delayed until today due to the equipment of the new campus. The current campus has a good environment, but there are still unsuitable aspects. On the one hand, we should strive to improve, and on the other hand, we hope that everyone will study hard. The school board will supervise the school to achieve perfection. Next, Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, gave a speech, stating that the importance of girls' education is well known. Twenty or thirty years ago, girls had very few opportunities to study. Now, girls have the same opportunity to enter school and learn as boys. When you enter school, it is not only to prepare for going to university in the future, but more importantly, to prepare for how to be a person in the future. We hope that you will be modern female citizens, not fashionable college students. However, being a modern female citizen entails responsibilities no less than those of men, and sometimes even greater. Because if China has a good woman, she can educate several good children, which is of great importance to the nation. Therefore, on the one hand, we should seek the cultivation of knowledge, and on the other hand, we should have a deep observation of things in order to lead and educate children. Now I have three hopes: (1) to have sufficient common sense, (2) to have a diligent and hard-working attitude, and (3) to pay attention to physical exercise. Then, guest Zhang Zhonghuan gave a speech, Principal Wu Zhiqian reported on school affairs, teacher representative Zhu Lin gave a speech, student representative Jin Jiaoli gave a speech, and the ceremony concluded with music played by the military band of the School for the Blind.</p>
<p>Junyi Middle School: Wu Kaixian, principal of Junyi Middle School on Guohuo Road in this city, and Huang Zaoxiong, director of academic affairs, are reorganizing school affairs and are determined to reform.

Students who do not register after the start of classes will be replaced by new students. In addition, the school's Boy Scout troop was established this semester, with a total of 200 Boy Scouts.</p>
<p>Southeast Medical College: Southeast Medical College in Zhenru started on the 8th. Last night, the college's president, Guo Qiyuan, hosted a banquet for all faculty and staff at the Mingyuan restaurant in Laoximen and held a school affairs meeting to discuss comprehensive plans for all facilities this semester. Now that most of the students have arrived, it has been decided that formal classes will begin on the 15th. It is also heard that students from afar have been writing to the school in recent days, requesting a make-up exam because they were unable to arrive in time for the previous exam period. Therefore, it has been decided to hold another exam on the 20th of this month.</p>

Classes are held daily from 5:30 pm to 8:30 pm, which is the same as the method used by Soochow University Law School, making it convenient for students who have jobs or are studying at other universities.

<p>Evening: Xia Guang Wins Over Zhenru</p>
<p>Result: 45 to 32</p>
<p>The Zhenru basketball team was missing Han Zhenyuan and Wang Nanzhen last night, which greatly reduced its strength and disorganized its formation. Their shooting lost its mark. Huang Zhaolin, known for his good shooting, also lost his target last night, leading to Xia Guang's victory. It was observed that Xia Guang had not shown outstanding performance in the Shanghai Basketball Association. Last night, against the depleted Zhenru team, he was able to move freely and show his brilliance. Iron Bull Chen Baoqiu was especially powerful. Zhenru was at a loss. In the first half, Xia Guang scored 28 points, and Zhenru scored 11 points. The final result was 45 to 32, with Xia Guang winning. The other four matches last night were all in Group B, with the following results: (1) Jianmei defeated Feifei 44 to 30, (2) Tujin defeated Shangzhong 52 to 20, (3) Yi Team defeated Zhengfeng 32 to 27, (4) Wanxing defeated Nanguang 34 to 31.

<p>Guo Rennie vs. Wang Deming Competing Among Twenty-Two Players | Billiards King Li Gongying Absent</p>
<p>The Bankers' Club, one of Shanghai's famous and upscale entertainment venues, holds two annual billiards handicap competitions to promote sports and increase interest. Since the start of this year's competition, there have been twenty-two competitors. Only Billiards King Li Gongying is absent, perhaps to give others a taste of the championship.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Handicap Table Standard <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Among the twenty-two players, their usual scores vary. The highest is Mr. Hu Yunlai's 300 points. Mr. Cao Jiru, Mr. Xu Junyi, and Mr. Zhu Boquan each have 250 points. Mr. Wang Tianshen (230), Mr. Zhou Shoufu (230), Mr. Liu Li (220), Mr. Yang Jiemei (200), and others have over 200 points. Next, Mr. Yang Dunfu has 180 points, and Mr. Hu Yunzhuang, Mr. Yang Chengyi, and Mr. Lin Zhenbin each have 170 points. Mr. Tang Shoumin, Mr. Ren Nian, and Mr. Hua Weizhong each have 160 points. Mr. Lin Kanghou, Mr. Fan Wenzhao, Mr. Hu Yun'an, Mr. Zhang Peishen, and Mr. Wang Deming each have 150 points.</p>
<p>Mr. Li Yunliang and Mr. Zhang Shouchun each have 140 points. The above scores are set as the goal for each individual competition. The first to reach the goal wins. The so-called handicap competition is to give everyone an equal opportunity.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Tomorrow's Finals <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Since the opportunities are equal, the trend of victory or defeat depends on how each individual responds during the competition. Those who can remain calm as usual often defeat their opponents. Those who are temporarily lucky and rise rapidly, or those who are careless and lose all their efforts, are often seen in this competition. In this year's situation, those with scores above 200 points have been eliminated in the preliminary and semi-final rounds. Conversely, those with scores below 200 points are competing in the semi-finals, with Guo Renping, Hu Yunzhuang, Zhang Peishen, and Wang Deming vying for the top spots. As a result, Guo Renping and Wang Deming will compete for the final championship tomorrow morning at 6:00 am at the club.</p>

<h3 id="e175">Flattery and the Kick <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— Zhanlu</p>
<p>In this era where "flattery can get you anywhere," flattering people and living day by day are certainly the tricks of a clown. But! If flattery is not done properly, it can be like the saying: "Flattering people only to get a kick in the pants," then it becomes "doing good only to become bad."</p>
<p>Who does good only to become bad? Please look at a Persian reporter.</p>
<p>Recently, according to a telegram from the Persian capital: a reporter from the Kotchishi newspaper in the Persian capital, in order to praise the wisdom of the Persian king for dismissing the chief attendant, Di Muschi, wrote an article praising the Persian king to the best of his ability. Who knew that he had angered the Persian king and was sentenced to disrespect and great disrespect, and ordered to work as a street cleaner in front of the palace as a slight warning. The Persian king was still considered civilized and did not execute the reporter in a muddle-headed way. However, it is also extremely ridiculous for a great reporter to become a street cleaner and practice "intellectuals swept from the earth."</p>
<p>Having lost the clumsy pole, and clinging to this street-cleaning broom, both are using effort under the wrist, but the upper-level work has become lower-level work. Can you still "sweep thousands of people with a clumsy tip"? Most Chinese reporters are accustomed to using writing brushes, so when they become street cleaners, they can only hold a reed broom. Foreign reporters do not use writing brushes but fountain pens, so this reporter from the Kotchishi newspaper can only hold a wire broom! If it is a day for a big cleanup, he can be hired as an instructor! Hehe!</p>
<h3 id="e176">Spring Snow <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— Xiangdi</p>
<p>Getting up in the morning, I suddenly saw pure white snow piled on the houses, and I felt quite surprised in my heart; last night was not very cold, yet it had snowed, and how could I not have known at all?</p>
<p>The old calendar is already the Lantern Festival, and time has finally crept into spring. Naturally, the snow that fell last night was spring snow. It is said that spring snow melts more easily than winter snow, and indeed it is true. The snow that accumulated last night had completely melted before noon, leaving almost no trace.</p>
<p>Although spring snow is not as interesting as winter snow, it is not something that spoils the scenery. Winter snow adorning plum blossoms is more poetic, and spring snow adorning peach blossoms or...</p>
<p>Japanese cherry blossoms, I think, would be even more poetic. It's a pity that in the second or third month of spring when peach blossoms or cherry blossoms are in full bloom, it rarely snows in spring, which is truly a scene-spoiler.</p>
<p>I remember that Japan seems to have more snow than China. I have seen spring snow once or twice, and it happened to be when the cherry blossoms were just blooming. Once, I also invited a few friends who loved to see cherry blossoms to Ueno Shrine to see the cherry blossoms after the snow, then we played in Ueno Park, and then took the tram to see them at Asukayama. Unfortunately, I couldn't write poetry, so although I had poetic feelings, I didn't create a poem; only one Japanese female classmate who could compose haiku made a very beautiful haiku. Recalling these elegant events now, they are like a light dream, floating and disappearing.</p>
<p>In China, especially in bustling and unbearably vulgar cities like Shanghai, even peach blossoms are rarely seen. Even if it snows in February or March, it's useless. It's better not to come down so reluctantly. Poetic feeling will never exist here, I think.</p>
<h3 id="e177">To Dalian <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— Juan Yun</p>
<p>I cannot forget that [Dalian] is our Chinese land, a part forcibly occupied by Japanese power; it is the source of the invasion of Manchuria and Mongolia by Japanese ambitious figures! It's no exaggeration, they have already become obedient subjects under Japanese rule. Anyone living in Dalian can no longer imagine that [Dalian] was once Chinese territory! Disgraced warlords, treacherous merchants who monopolize Japanese goods, people who can no longer gain a foothold in mainland China, there is no better way than to go to Dalian.</p>
<p>[Refugees and Traitors] Dalian is a sanctuary for this group of people. Wealthy Chinese people, seeing the chaos in the country, going abroad to foreign countries seems too troublesome, might as well buy a house in Dalian and become a carefree [Dalian recluse]!</p>
<p>I have been to Dalian a total of four times. The first three times were from Tianjin, taking the Tangshan Maru back to Qingdao, passing through Dalian. It required a delay of two days.</p>
<p>The most recent time was last year in July, after recovering from illness in Beiping for three weeks. I decided to take a trip to Harbin via Dalian. At least through my work, I could observe the secrets along the way of the Manchurian puppet state.</p>
<p>This time going to Dalian was not as free as before. Upon arriving at the pier, I had to sign my name and write a detailed statement stating where I was going and the specific reasons for my business.</p>
<p>It was really difficult, although I had many friends living under the Manchurian puppet state, but my purpose and business, even I myself had not decided. In order to fulfill the formalities, I had to mention Mr. X, who lives in Dalian.</p>
<p>Mr. X received me very warmly, and the reunion after a long separation seemed especially polite. During our private talks, we talked about the affairs of the Manchurian puppet state.</p>
<p>Truly conscienceless! There are actually Chinese people bringing money to invest in Manchuria! At the same time, I can well remember that during the January 28th Shanghai Incident last year, there were even people advocating expanding trade with Japan!</p>
<p>Danger and obstacles, after I lingered in Dalian for three days, Mr. X strongly discouraged my trip to Harbin.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Delighted Hope for Clouds and Rainbows <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— ·Ti·Gong</p>
<p>Before Eyun came, Yifen repeatedly praised her beauty. When Eyun was about to come, the fellow member Xu Ziquan praised her art even more. Mr. Ziquan, some say he has a suggestive relationship with her, but his words may not be entirely trustworthy. Comparing her first night's performance, it was indeed flawless.</p>
<p>From behind the curtain, a sound of "bitter ah" revealed a talented person. Her appearance is beautiful, her voice is sweet, and her performance of the Erhuang aria follows the style of Tan Xinpei, pleasing to the ears. The facial expressions are just right. It's a pity that her starry eyes are slightly small, failing to fully convey the spirit. Her stage steps, preferring to touch the ground with her toes, slightly detract from the beauty. Considering her singing and acting as a whole, she is sufficient to surpass others and compete with Xue Yanqun.</p>
<p>Singing "E Yun Xing," she is worthy of her name, and the people of Shanghai looking forward to her beauty is like a great drought hoping for clouds and rainbows. Therefore, I offer the four words "Delighted Hope for Clouds and Rainbows" as a gift to her.</p>
<h3 id="e179">A Glimpse of the Tea Dance <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— Guo Lanxin</p>
<p>In the midst of flying rain and snow, it really seemed as if I saw refugees from the Northeast, crying out in hunger and cold. I and Jin Yu, in order to fulfill a bit of our wish to help our compatriots in the Northeast, endorsed several tickets, and also braved the rain and snow to attend. The time of arrival was half past five. The Rue Lafayette in the rain and snow had a different kind of flavor.</p>
<p>Arriving outside the gate of the Amusement Park, I saw the party and national flags hanging as if in tears. We went in and saw cars displayed like an exposition, knowing that many people had attended. At the same time, it was also clear that many of the attendees were from the bourgeoisie, who should donate some money and also be able to spend money to save the country and help their compatriots.</p>
<p>We went upstairs, and there were still many people continuing to come, but regrettably it was already full. We went up another floor to observe, looking down into the dance hall below, filled with many party and national dignitaries, famous figures out of office, social celebrities, their wives and daughters, and star dancers. The fragrance of clothes, the shape of beards, the brilliance of pearls and jewelry, there was no shadow of refugees, only a display of vying for beauty, flaunting and exaggerating.</p>
<p>I thought to myself that if the decorations of the wives, daughters, and stars present could be donated, the value would exceed the ticket income by hundreds of times, and the refugees in the Northeast would surely benefit greatly. But this is just my own thought; in reality, it will never be realized.</p>
<p>Because there were no seats, we toured around, seeing many novel and magnificent fashions. Those clothing materials were all Western goods. At the same time, I felt that the cost of the perms, powder, rouge, lipstick, and perfume of the women who participated this time would also be enough to account for several fractions of the total ticket income, right? How grand!</p>
<p>Finally, after staying for five minutes, we began to leave. The music of the waltz sent us off. Joy, embraces, wild dancing, refugees, iron and blood, the illusion of national subjugation seemed to be intertwined and spinning. We had no intention of staying, so we rushed out of the glass door, jumped into the car, and returned. At the same time, cars were still carrying groups of people in. The rain and snow were flying up at this time, like tears of despair.</p>

<h3 id="e180">The Strange Encounter of the Novel "Hun Jianglong" (River-stirring Dragon) <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— Huo Xueming</p>
<p>The river was very wide, very clear, and bottomless, just a distant expanse of clear blue, a layer of flowing mercury-like shimmering moonlight. But River-stirring Dragon's experience would not fail because of this. He could find the trace-free [fish nests]. Soon, at a withered tree where the water swirled unusually, on the waves where the shadow slanted, he gained endless hope. A desire like wildfire raised its head and repeatedly teased the fragile branches of the reeds, habitually jumping over here. He quickly took off his outer cotton-padded jacket.</p>
<p>In less than the blink of an eye, he straightened his legs, moved the fishing spear, and made a pose like a squirrel, using all his strength. He looked closely, and then jumped into the water.</p>
<p>A huge splash of water jumped up, startling the crows roosting on the large elm tree, and causing them to fly and cry in all directions. The狂響 barking of dogs echoed from nearby villages, and the reeds sighed as if...... Without saying, patterns like swirls immediately appeared on the river surface, like a shattered white crystal mirror of moonlight.</p>
<p>Here, the fishing spear tightly gripped in River-stirring Dragon's hand had deeply pierced into the river bottom, and his entire body was submerged in the cold water. As usual, his multi-pronged fishing spear would find three or five crucian carp or blackfish. The cost of his effort would definitely not be too bad, he was very clear. So, he grasped the handle of the fishing spear with both hands underwater, and pulled it up with force. It was very heavy, definitely a big fish. He thought: as usual, he could conveniently hide them one by one in his fish basket. At this time, the air around Lingjia River returned to silence and cold.</p>
<p>[What?] River-stirring Dragon began to utter this surprised scream in the water. The water surface was silent. He immediately surfaced and jumped towards the shore, opening his eyes to see that a bloody little child's head was hanging on the tip of the fishing spear, shockingly. Under the moonlight, it could be seen that this head belonged to his own newborn baby. (3)</p>

<p>My friends, there are many who can write well, and there are also many who don't write much but write very well. For example, my old friend Ding Song, he has always been known as [Ximen Qing exhausted his fame in his time, acquiring a good hand in painting], but his articles are not easy to read. This time, I had a whimsical idea, so I specially invited these friends who don't write much to write some articles for us to read, just like a famous actor performing a reversed role on stage.

<p>— Ding Song</p>
<p>Teacher ××:</p>
<p>Because I drift everywhere, and my whereabouts are uncertain, I can't even tell you a mailing address, so naturally I hope to receive your reply, but in fact, it will never happen. However, the two letters I sent you before should not be lost by the post office, right?</p>
<p>Teacher! Now I think that a person's luck cannot be forced. Thanks to the kindness of the teacher and teacher's wife, who helped me step into the door of society, I extremely wanted to do my best and create some great achievements. Firstly, to repay my loving mother's hardship in raising me, and secondly, to live up to the expectations of the teachers. But time has passed like lightning, and not only have my hopes of achieving a career become a bubble, but I am afraid that there will be a danger that I will not be able to meet you in the future! Thinking about it now, I feel indescribably uncomfortable! Putting everyone's kindness completely to waste, the more I think about it, the more heartbroken I am, the more I think about it, the more annoyed I am! Now my nerves are receiving extremely intense stimulation. If I didn't have a loving mother alive, I would have killed myself long ago!</p>
<p>Teacher, don't think that I am groaning without illness. Thinking about it, I really have many things to apologize to you all!·····························</p>
<p>This is a letter that a very proud female student of Mr. S sent him from 　埠. After reading it, he felt very unhappy. He thought that her family only had an old mother and two elder sisters, and both elder sisters were widows and addicted to opium. Within the family, there were no uncles or brothers, and all living expenses depended entirely on this weak woman who was not yet twenty years old, who had to compete and struggle for survival in this man-eating society. This was an extremely pitiful thing. But looking at the tone of her letter, it seemed to contain a kind of unspeakable secret, which really made him have ten thousand doubts.</p>
<p>One day eight years ago, on an old lunar New Year's Day, in the厢房 side room of a 石库门 shikumen-style house in 里 Lane on ×× Road, there was a board door placed there. Lying on the board door was a corpse, covered from head to toe with a semi-new, semi-old printed silk padded quilt. It was impossible to tell whether it was male or female, but the corpse's abdomen was bulging, which was a bit odd. Next to it was an old woman with already gray hair, and two middle-aged women crying, all folding paper ingots in their hands, the scene was very tragic. After a while, suddenly they heard the sound of the gate, and a few people walked in. The first to enter was a middle-aged man, wearing a very neat Western suit, with a very solemn attitude. Three women followed behind, all dressed very neatly. One was a twenty-something round-faced woman with a tall figure and a very delicate appearance; one was about thirty years old, and her appearance was not bad; one was a little older, with a plump figure and a good complexion. As they walked in, the two women in the side room, seeing them, immediately put down the folded paper ingots in their hands with tears and rushed forward to greet them. The old woman also came forward to greet them. When they walked to the board door where the corpse was placed, they gently lifted the end of the padded quilt covering the corpse with their hands. It revealed a young female corpse with yellow complexion like wax, and a head full of hair.</p>

<p>Seller activity: Yesterday, London's major bars for both near and far terms contracted by .0625. Exchange rates saw mixed rises and falls. The far-term silver price was slightly lower by .125. English-American and American-English both lowered by .125. American cotton saw little fluctuation, opening at 803.6 taels. Although a slight drop was observed, the exchange market opened very flat, and the gold price also rebounded. Anda ate May U.S. dollars at 28.25 yuan and reached 804.8 taels. After that, the market suddenly turned down, and the market situation seemed weak. Foreign exchange tended to soften, with May U.S. dollars trading at 28.275 yuan, already .125 lower than initially heard. In addition, the Central Bank's swap spread advanced by 5 taels, willing to release February's long positions. Sellers seemed to be prevalent, and the price once entered the 800 tael mark, at 799.4 taels, before gradually leveling off. Hengxing once opened 105 contracts on behalf of the Central Bank at a price of 800 taels, but was held back. The midday closing was 801 taels. The afternoon market was flat with little trading. Initially, buyers saw a surge, reaching 1.5 taels. Afterwards, the exchange market continued to harden, and brokers sold U.S. dollars, breaking through the 800 tael mark again, reaching 799.2 taels. The market then fluctuated before rebounding to 801 taels due to rumors of a price drop in Mumbai. Although the exchange market was harder than the midday closing by .0625, with May U.S. dollars trading at 28.4275 yuan, the market was slightly stabilized due to the U.S. bank holiday today, allowing the price to hold above the 800 tael mark. The final closing was 800 taels and .008 cash. Upon investigation, the sellers' activity reversed today, so although the price was high initially, it turned downstream. The boiled gold was flat, initially adding 12.75 taels, then rising to 13 taels. Swaps seemed active, likely because the Central Bank was willing to swap, and various spot firms were swapping out. Spot gold also slightly defended, but the spot firms' defensive positions were still insufficient, so Yingfeng Heng's swaps were still posted, priced at 4 taels, which was more peaceful than last Saturday. The market conditions for the day are recorded below:</p>
<p>Morning Market Once Entered 800 Taels: The morning opening was at 803.6 taels, opening at 803.8 taels. The exchange market opened with a bid price of 1 shilling 7 pence .5625 for near-term English exchange and 27.9375 yuan for U.S. exchange, the same as the closing price, so it appeared slightly prosperous. Hengyu initially advanced to 4 taels, and Daxing Yongjin also advanced to 4 taels. Anda ate March U.S. exchange at 28.25 yuan. Hengyu advanced further, reaching 804.8 taels. Zhifeng Yongyuan Maoyong came to sell, so it retreated to within 4 taels. May U.S. dollars at .25 could not be sold. Yifeng Yongfu Xingyong competed to sell at around .25. Shen Da Zhaofeng Chang all absorbed, while Zhifeng Yongying Fengheng sold, so there were rises and falls at around .25. HSBC's listed prices for shillings and U.S. dollars remained unchanged, but Yifeng Yong continued to sell bars, retreating to around .25. Yuanmaoyong limited-price bars were slightly held up. When Citibank sold April U.S. dollars at .25, the exchange market seemed to harden. Hengyu Shunli all sold, so the price fell to within 1 tael, at 800 taels and .005 cash. Yongfeng came to advance, returning to above 1 tael. Qingfa Yonghongli all purchased, and May U.S. dollars at .375, HSBC Pangen all bought in, so the price rose to 1.8 taels. At this point, Pangen suddenly posted March U.S. dollars at .125. Daxing Yongda Decheng came to sell bars, retreating to within 1 tael. Zhifeng Yong sold again, at .002 cash. Hengyu advanced to above 1 tael, at 1.3 taels. At this time, there was much fluctuation. When Fuchang Jinqi retreated, retail investors rushed to press down the price. Qianchangxiang sold to around 800 taels. Runchangyu once limited the plate to advance, and hedgers also purchased, so the price was pulled up by .05 or .06 cash. March U.S. dollars at .1875 were not easy to sell at this point. Qianchangxiang sold bars again, and Qingfa Yong also sold, so the price broke through the 800 tael mark, gradually retreating to 799.4 taels, and started to hover, with several cash price fluctuations. Hengxing opened spot gold on behalf of the Central Bank, so the price was pushed to above 800 taels, and buyers seemed numerous, continuing to rise by 1 tael, to 801 taels. Items came to sell bars for hedging, so the price fell back by .02 cash, to .008 cash. Before long, it was the closing, at 801 taels. Items were slightly lower, closing at 800 taels and .008 cash.</p>
<p>Closing Stood Firm Above 800 Taels: The afternoon market was extremely flat, opening at 800 taels and .006 cash. The opening for items was slightly lower, at 800 taels and .005 cash, so it quickly reached .005 cash. Retail investors poured in, reaching .008 cash. Items continued to sell for hedging, and retreated to .002 cash again. After that, buying momentum seemed to rise, and although trading in the market was less, the board price was stronger, so the price fluctuated upwards, reaching above 1 tael, at 1.2 taels. Shunli came to sell, within 1 tael. Fuyu sold bars, at .002 cash. Yuanmaoyong et al. came to purchase, so the price broke through above .01 taels, reaching 1.5 taels. Huabi sold April U.S. dollars at .25 to the Dalian gang. Shunli came to sell bars for hedging, and Zhifengyong also sold, at around 1 tael. Hengyu tended to sell bars. Hengyu sold to .005 cash, and Yuanmaoyong sold to within 800 taels. April U.S. dollars at .3125 and February U.S. dollars at .125 could all be closed. Hengyu sold again, at .095, and fluctuated around 800 taels for a very long time. This month's U.S. dollars at .1875 were endorsed by the bank. Hengyu sold even more, so the price fell to 799.2 taels, and the situation fluctuated before turning back. Fuyu advanced the bars and pulled the price up. Hengyu suddenly purchased again, reaching 1 tael, likely because this month's U.S. dollars at .1875 needed to be settled in Zhejiang. Fuchang came to sell, and the price fluctuated again within taels, once falling to .002 cash, before being pulled up again a few cash because Qingfa Yong came to advance. Mumbai had a report of a small decrease, so people's hearts had already tended to stabilize. There were no formal counterparts, so the price could only hover around .05 cash. When Fuyu came to advance, there was a moment of excitement, but the number was not large, and the price rose to .09 cash before stopping. It was close to the closing at this time. The price finally retreated by .01 cash, closing at 800 taels and .008 cash. The items closed at the same price. Upon investigation, the morning had slight waves, while the afternoon was flat. The highest price was 804.8 taels, and the lowest price was 799.2 taels, with a fluctuation of 5.6 taels. As a result, the price fell by 3.6 taels compared to the previous closing.</p>
<p>Listed Price Reduced by 3.6 Taels: Because HSBC's listed price was unchanged, the listed price was still calculated at 27.75 yuan, and the gold price was 864.86 taels. According to the closing price, the estimated difference was around 64 taels, which was 3.6 taels less than the previous closing. The February registration was 802 taels, the March registration was 801 taels, and the makeup water was around 803 taels in the morning and afternoon.</p>
<p>Many Providers of Transactions: The afternoon over-the-counter transactions seemed quiet. Yuanmaoyong Yuanheng Daxing Yongheng Yu Fafayong Hong were all advancing, while Zhifeng Yongrunchang Yongshunli Yifeng Yongfuchang Fuxing Yongying Fengheng Dadecheng Qianchangxiang Bingxing were all selling. The Dalian gang sold, the Guangzhou gang Hengxing advanced, and there were not many Shen Da transactions. There was a surge of supply because the Central Bank was willing to release the swaps over-the-counter.</p>
<p>Over 200 Taels of Boiled Gold Traded: Yesterday, the boiled gold market initially added 12.75 taels to the calculated price. Dafeng Hengtai Kangrun were all sellers, while Yingfengheng advanced. Two flat transactions were made. After that, the price gradually increased to 13 taels, and silver shops began to sell. Jingfu slightly accepted, and one flat transaction was made. The market situation was still flat, with a total of over 200 taels traded.</p>
<p>Swaps Were More Active: Swaps seemed active yesterday because the Central Bank was already willing to release the long positions. Spot gold also defended slightly. (It was heard that Yingfeng Heng Dadecheng totaled about 2000 taels). However, Yingfeng Heng still posted because it did not count the positions. The initial asking price for the spread was around 5 taels, but the shorts were unwilling to swap. Later, spot gold firms such as Dafeng Heng Tongfeng Heng all posted, so the price was 4 taels, and transactions began. Yingfeng Heng posted 35 contracts to Dafeng Heng, and 140 contracts to Tongfeng Heng, all belonging to February swapping March.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Foreign Exchange Turned to a Loose Trend <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>丨Banks Sold More Than They Bought丨</p>
<p>The exchange market was still flat yesterday, with a slight trend towards hardening. This was initially because the London major bar rate in foreign telegrams contracted by .0625 for both near and far terms, the English exchange against the U.S. exchange decreased by .125, and the U.S. exchange against the English exchange increased by .125. Therefore, the English exchange opened still flat, with a near-term bid price of 1 shilling 7 pence .5625. The New York silver price contracted by .125, and the foreign exchange silver price decreased by .04 cash. The bank's private telegraph also fell by .125. The U.S. exchange also opened flat, with a near-term bid price of 27.9375 yuan. However, it immediately tended to loosen after opening. March U.S. dollars were traded at .0625 on the market. HSBC's listed prices for both English and U.S. dollars remained unchanged, which was not very relevant. May U.S. dollars went from .155 to .375. Citibank and Pangen were very active in selling in the morning, and the gold industry initially sold and then bought with force. Anda also accepted, occasionally with someone selling gold for hedging. The afternoon was also the same. The afternoon re-hardened by .0625, with April U.S. dollars being traded at .3125 and this month's at .1875. Banks sold more than they bought. By the closing, the near-term bid price was 1 shilling 7 pence .68775 for English exchange and 28.125 yuan for U.S. dollars. There was a review of .1875 during the day, and the result was harder by .125 (English exchange) and .1875 (U.S. exchange) compared to the closing on the previous Saturday. The entry and exit prices of each bank are recorded below:</p>
<p>English Exchange: The opening near-term bid price was 1 shilling 7 pence .5625. Citibank sold February 1 shilling 7 pence .625 to Huabi, already harder by .0625 compared to the opening. Zhongfu sold April .6875 to Sassoon, and there were few transactions. Extending to the midday closing, the bid price ranged from 1 shilling 7 pence .625 to .6875. In the afternoon, Huabi initially advanced two parts .75, because the midday closing bid price was around .6875, and .625 did not seem easy to sell. Later, there was extreme stillness. Extending to the closing, the bid price was 1 shilling 7 pence .6875 for February, the same for March, .75 for April, and the same for May. The buying price was the same at .75 for February and March, and the same at .8125 for April and May.</p>
<p>U.S. Exchange: The opening near-term bid price was 27.9375 yuan, the same as the closing price on the previous Saturday. Citibank initially sold March 28.0625 yuan and loosened. Anda ate May .25 and then bought the same month again at .375. Citibank sold April .1875. Zhejiang sold April .25. Pangen initially sold April .1875, then .25, and then sold March .125, and ate May .375. Citibank sold April .25, Shanghai sold May .375 to Zhongfu, and Anda Citibank did the same July price. The midday closing bid price ranged from 28.0625 yuan to .375. In the afternoon, Huabi initially sold April .25 and then sold March .1875. Citibank also sold the same month at the same price. Zhongfu Citibank both sold April .3125. Shanghai sold May .4375 to Zhongfu. Anda sold February .1875 to Citibank. The closing bid price was 28.125 yuan for February, .1875 for March, .3125 for April, and .375 for May. The buying price was 28.1875 yuan for February, .25 for March, .375 for April, and 28.5 yuan for May. One U.S. dollar was equivalent to 3 taels 6 cash .036 li.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Major Bar Near and Far Unchanged <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>The National News Agency's 13th dispatch from London reported that the major bar had no movement. The closing price for the near term was still 16 pence .5625, and the far term was still 16 pence .625. Also, the English-American exchange rate opened at 3 yuan 4 jiao 3.5 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Slight Improvement in Foreign Interest, Silver Loan Rate Remains Unchanged <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>Market Situation: Yesterday, Monday, banks conducted business as usual. However, due to sluggish usage and weak buying interest, interbank transactions were not very active, leading to a calm market situation. There was little hope for price increases. Ultimately, both the interest rate and the silver loan rate saw only slight improvements or remained unchanged. This indicates that various industries are still in a period of development and cannot be expected to flourish.</p>
<p>Interest Rate and Silver Loan Market Prices: [Foreign Interest] The early market interest rate showed a slight improvement of 1 hao, 2 hu, and 5 li, reaching 7 qian, 1 fen, 4 li, and 7 hao and 5 hu. The afternoon market improved by another 1 hao, 2 hu, and 5 li, reaching 7 qian, 1 fen, 4 li, and 8 hao and 7 hu. In total, the two markets rose by 2 hao and 5 li, but trading volume was very low. [Silver Loan] In both the morning and afternoon markets, apart from transfers, new transactions involving silver loan notes were scarce. Therefore, the rate remained unchanged as a "white loan" (interest-free loan). In the afternoon and at the small general meeting, the clearing price was also done as a "white clearing" without any added interest. Auxiliary Currency Market Conditions: Jiangnan small coins rose by 5 li compared to the previous day, calculated at 66 qian, 2 fen, and 5 li. The prices were the same in both the morning and afternoon markets. The trading volume was 6,000 jiao in the morning market and 3,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Guangdong small coins were priced at 5 qian, 9 fen, and 1 li and 5 hao in the morning market and 5 qian, 6 fen, 2 li, 1 hao, and 2 hu in the afternoon market. The trading volume was 115,000 jiao in the morning market and 65,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins rose slightly by 1,000 wen, reaching 416,500 wen.</p>
<p>Silver and Foreign Currency Inflow and Outflow: [Silver] The amount of silver received by banks is gradually increasing. Yesterday, foreign banks received 2.8 to 2.9 million in bill payments, Chinese banks received 3.2 to 3.3 million in bill payments, over 700,000 in telegraphic transfers, 1.5 to 1.6 million in advances, over 7 million in various goods, foreign exchange taxes, and miscellaneous payments, 3.6 to 3.7 million in special payments, 500,000 into warehouses, 800,000 out of warehouses, over 1.2 million in silver mortgage transactions, over 29 million in silver public notes from money shops, over 4.1 million in clearing payments, over 60 million in remittances from various sources, and 300,000 to 400,000 in collections. [Foreign Currency] Only 240,000 in foreign exchange drafts were made in the morning market, and 820,000 in the afternoon market. In the banknote trading market, 65,000 were traded in the morning and 90,000 in the afternoon. Outside the market, 135,000 were traded in the morning and 75,000 in the afternoon. 20,000 in checks were traded in the morning and 40,000 in the afternoon. Interbank trading of foreign currency amounted to 300,000 in the morning and 700,000 in the afternoon. Over 1.5 million in receipts and payments between foreign accounts, over 1.1 million in banknote inflow and outflow, over 800,000 in foreign mortgage payments, over 5.2 million in foreign public notes from money shops, over 1.4 million in foreign clearing payments, over 1.4 million in foreign currency borrowing and lending inflow and outflow, and over 500,000 in small money shop transactions.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Securities and Bond Market Extremely Bullish <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>1919 Customs and Salt Tax Rises by One to One and a Half Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday at the Chinese Securities Exchange, various bonds were extremely bullish, and trading gradually became more active. Various groups followed the financial community, buying vigorously, while short sellers covered their positions. The atmosphere was tense and dynamic. This trend persisted from morning to night without weakening. At the beginning of the morning session, prices rose slightly by 3 to 5 jiao. However, the unified salt tax remained flat. In the second session, all prices rose by 3 to 5 jiao. In the first afternoon session, the upward trend was even stronger, rising another 2 to 3 jiao, reaching 6 to 7 jiao. Before closing, various listed prices showed a slight pullback of 1 to 2 jiao, while the unified salt tax continued to rise, increasing by another 2 to 3 jiao, reaching 5 to 6 jiao. Among these trends, the unified salt tax in the first session was relatively flat, while it rose more in the second session. The unified salt tax in the third session was even flatter, but it rebounded by several jiao at the close. On the buying side, numbers 13, 16, 17, and 20 mostly bought on behalf of the financial community. Although numbers 32, 38, and 50 sold, demand still exceeded supply. Furthermore, retail investors' buying interest was also considerable. Therefore, after the close, market sentiment remained strong. As a result, prices rose across the board, with the 1919 Customs and Salt Tax rising the most, by one to one and a half yuan. The Disbandment and Unified Tax rose by about 8 jiao, while the rest rose by about half a yuan. The trading volume significantly increased compared to the previous day, reaching a total of 8,363,000 yuan, including 8,000 yuan in spot trading. The unified salt tax alone accounted for 4 million yuan, the Disbandment Tax also had over 1 million yuan, and the rest ranged from 300,000 to 700,000 to 800,000.</p>
<h3 id="e188">New York Stock Market Firm <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>According to a report from the New Fung Foreign Firm, on the 11th, the New York stock market was firm due to an increase of 11,104 in the number of railway cars. After the death of John Ryan, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Anaconda Copper Mining, arrangements had been made for someone to maintain it, and the price was firm. The American Smelting and Refining Company has declared its withdrawal from the Copper Export Association, which specializes in copper export trade. The trading volume for half a day totaled 345,000 shares. The stock market's recovery above the support level suggests a good technical outlook. This is due to powerful bankers currently reorganizing the Missouri Pacific Railroad, an increase in automobile sales in January, and the bank clearing numbers being better than the same period last year. However, considering the current situation, the stock market is unlikely to experience significant fluctuations in the short term, barring unforeseen events. The Dow Jones indices for the 11th are listed below:</p>
<p>Closing Price Compared to the Previous Day:</p>
<p>Thirty Industrial Stocks: 59.43, up 0.32</p>
<p>Twenty Railroad Stocks: 29.40, down 0.09</p>
<p>Twenty Utility Stocks: 25.50, up 0.05</p>
<p>Forty Bonds: 80.60, up 0.07</p>
<h3 id="e189">Both Yarn and Cotton Markets Showing Weakness <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market is very sluggish, showing a weak trend. Actual market demand remains stagnant, and financial conditions in various regions are extremely tight. Therefore, it is very difficult for business to develop, leading to a daily increase in inventory, which weakens market confidence. As for Guangdong, which has the largest sales volume of Chinese yarn, it is currently facing economic difficulties and has an inventory of over 20,000 bales. Its purchasing power is also lacking. Furthermore, Japanese merchants are constantly seizing the sales channels for Chinese yarn in Tianjin, leading to yarn being brought to Shanghai for sale. The price of certain foreign yarn has plummeted by 6 to 7 yuan, and its future remains uncertain.</p>
<p>Recent Decline in Yarn Price by Half a Liang: At the opening of the futures market, the price of external cotton was flat and weak, leading to poor market sentiment. Buying interest in the market was lacking, and prices for all months fell by 5, 6, and 7 qian. Market sentiment remained weak in the afternoon, but some profit-takers covered short positions. Prices for nearby months were flat, while prices for distant months rose by 1, 4, and 5 qian. The total trading volume for the day was 29,300 bales. Sales included 650 bales of Jifeng, 1,050 bales of Dafeng, 1,450 bales of Renfeng, 750 bales of Yichong, 650 bales of Changfeng, 1,150 bales of Shengtai, and 1,850 bales of Xincheng. Purchases included 1,250 bales of Mingde, 900 bales of Changji, 550 bales of Zhenda, 700 bales of Tongxing, 1,550 bales of Yichang, and 2,050 bales of Dachang. Closing prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Closing Price Increase/Decrease in the Futures Market: Account Balance: May 1443, down 4, 30,300; February 1412, down 5, 33,050; June 1451, down 5, 18,450; March 1425, flat, 46,950; July 1456, up 1, 8,350; April 1433, flat, 41,550; Total: 178,650.</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Sales Still Stagnant: Total purchases from various groups for the day were 415 bales, with prices falling by about 5 qian. However, the prices of 32-count and 42-count yarn fell by 1 to 1.5 liang. Purchase amounts by various groups are as follows:</p>
<p>Shantou: 60; Changsha: 5; Hankou: 30; Xiamen: 10; Fujian: 1; Fellow Traders: 127; Guangdong: 40; Wuhu: 5; Ningbo: 32; Inland: 100; Northern Groups: 5</p>
<p>The cotton market remains weak due to the slight decline in overseas cotton markets. The gold market is also showing signs of easing. However, bullish sentiment remains exceptionally strong, with absorption and tightening without letting go, making it difficult for prices to fall. However, current demand for cotton from various mills is quite stagnant, and the yarn market is particularly weak. There is little interest in high-priced raw cotton. The future depends on the movements of American and Indian cotton.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao (cotton futures) Mixed with Slight Fluctuations: The Zheng Biao market opened lower, following the weakness in external cotton, falling by 5 fen to 1 qian. The afternoon opening was flat, with slight improvements in the second and third sessions, but prices fell again at the close. Prices for mid-term months rose by 5 fen to 1 qian, while prices for distant months were flat. The total trading volume for the day was 36,100 dan. Sales included 4,500 dan of Chunji, 3,300 dan of Gengfeng, 1,200 dan of Jifeng, 1,000 dan of Yuanda, 1,100 dan of Changhe, 900 dan of Yuchang, and 900 dan of Ruida. Purchases included 1,800 dan of Dafeng, 1,100 dan of Jilong, 1,100 dan of Mingming, 2,500 dan of Yichang, 1,100 dan of Yiyu, 1,100 dan of Shenji, and 1,100 dan of Taichang. Closing prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Increase/Decrease: Account Balance: May 3270, flat, 69,900; February 3165, up 5, 84,900; June 3275, down 10, 48,100; March 3225, up 5, 98,700; July 3290, down 10, 30,600; April 3250, up 5, 96,500; Total: 428,700.</p>
<p>Mill Demand Watching and Hesitant: Current demand for raw cotton is flat, and various mills are maintaining a wait-and-see attitude. Coupled with the stagnation of the yarn market, there is little interest in buying high-priced raw materials.</p>
<p>Xia Sha Cotton: 32.50, Weitong Mill Purchase: 138 pieces. Spot Delivery to Mill. Also, 32.00, Hengfeng Mill Purchase: 200 pieces. Also, North City Cotton: 31.50, Yongyu Mill Purchase: 200 bales.

<h3 id="e190">Grain and Rice Market Stagnant, Prices Fall Further <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai South: Yesterday, the source of supply had already decreased, with only about 20 vendors. Retail sales remained sluggish. Although wholesale purchases continued, selection was very strict, and only high-quality materials were taken. The market situation for Bo Dao (thin rice) of over 1,000 shi (a unit of dry measure) was still unstable, falling by several fen to a jiao compared to the previous day. However, sellers were reluctant to accept further price drops. As sales were slow, warehouse stocks naturally gradually increased, reaching 230 to 240 vendors, making it difficult to ease in the short term and hard to say if it would recover. The only hope for rice prices in Shanghai lies in the bustle of wholesale business. If this continues to be sluggish, it will be difficult to recover. Lu Yang Xian (a type of rice) was also in a downturn, and the price of Bian Yuan (debased currency) fell very quickly, dropping by 1.4 to 1.5 yuan in the past three or four days. Yin Yuan (silver currency) was also affected, becoming unstable and falling by a small 1 to 2 jiao. The Chang Bang (a group of merchants) had a dispute over the Dou Shi Hu (a unit of measure) with six, and in addition to having already telegraphed to the Chang Di (long-term) vendors, transactions would be discussed further once a response was received.</p>
<p>Shanghai North: Yesterday, the source of supply from various groups in Hexia (area south of the Yangtze River) was over 30 vendors. Bai Chi (white glutinous rice) and Zhong Ci (medium quality) were stable. The supply of Bo Geng (thin japonica rice) and early rice was limited, but the sales were still good, with prices tight at one chi (a unit of length). Yang Jian (rice tip) arrival was low but sales were active, with prices showing a tight sign. Du Bu Jian was fair, while Ke Jian (customer's tip) was set in Yin Yuan, while Bai Yuan was still fatigued.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Ke Xian (Guest Rice) Only Has Buying Interest in Ben Jie (local district) <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>Ke Xian (Guest Rice) has seen a recent increase in supply, leading to a sluggish market. Coupled with the continued arrival of Nanjing cart rice in recent days, market confidence is weak. Therefore, although Min Wei (Fujian interest) has buying interest, it is not accepted without a price reduction. Yesterday morning, Ke Bang (guest merchants) transactions were stagnant, with only Ben Jie (local district) handling 200 bags of Xiang Hong Mi (Hunan red rice) at a price of 8.5 yuan. The afternoon Ke Hua (guest transformation) was even quieter, while Ben Jie (local district) had strong buying interest, continuing to handle 200 bags of Xiang Hong Mi (Hunan red rice) and 650 bags of Jiangxi late rice at a price of 8.83 to 8.875 yuan. The prices of all goods were lower and weaker by several fen.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Ke Bang (Guest Group) Slightly Collects Distant Month Flour <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the flour market showed signs of stability, with foreign wheat quotations returning to good by one to two jiao. The early price for the current month was 1.83 liang, and the prices for distant months also followed, improving by 7.5 li to 1 fen. However, after the second session, the current month weakened again because the current buying interest from Ke Bang (guest groups) was only sporadic, with no large-scale sales. Therefore, it fell again. The distant term remained stable. When the afternoon session opened, the current month was still flat, because the current inventory of various factories was gradually increasing, while actual sales remained sluggish. Therefore, the spot goods of various factories also declined accordingly. For example, the Bing Chuan (military ship) standard only needed to add 3 fen, and miscellaneous brands added 1 fen, falling by 5 to 6 fen compared to the most bullish time. However, the distant term was stable due to the slight collection by the group. Given this situation, if Ke Xiao (guest sales) remains silent, it may be necessary to take according to standard and extract (tax). As a result, the current month was slightly lower than the previous week by 5 li, March was higher by 2.5 li, April and May were higher by 1.25 fen, June was higher by 1 fen, and July was higher by 5 li.</p>

<h3 id="e193">Basic Conditions When Buying Woolen Fabrics <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>Woolen fabrics have varying selling prices and the quality of the material varies greatly. The key is whether they are pure wool or wool-cotton blends. If it is a wool-cotton blend, what is the proportion of artificial fiber and yarn? Identifying these aspects will help you understand the quality of the woolen fabric. But how can you tell if it is all wool or a wool-cotton blend? There is no other method because precise testing requires equipment, which is not possible when buying goods in a hurry. The only thing you can do is a general observation. (1) Take the entire sample and rub it vigorously with both hands. When you release it, if there are no wrinkles, it is undoubtedly made of all wool (because wool yarn has elasticity and stretches when released). (2) Take several warp and weft threads from the woolen fabric in both horizontal and vertical directions and burn them. There will be an unpleasant odor, and the curl will shrink very quickly. Because wool has oil, it makes a slight squeaking sound, and the dark gray ash condenses like beads. If it is yarn, there is no unpleasant odor, the ash is easily scattered because it has no oil, and it burns when it encounters fire, unlike wool yarn, which burns quickly. Secondly, you must decide what you want to buy and not listen to the store clerk. Store clerks want to be loyal to their duties and will only consider the interests of the store and will not consider the interests of the customer. Therefore, discussing with the store clerk what kind of material to buy is no different from "asking a fox for its skin" (seeking advice from an untrustworthy source). So, make your own decision in advance and ask the store clerk for advice when you go to the store, only for reference. The most wasteful thing is (1) not knowing the quality of the material, but only listening to the price. After looking at the sample, only ask the price and keep asking for more samples to see. The store clerk's opportunity has come. He turns around a few times in the storage room or at the tree window, takes the same quality material, and quotes a high price. Or he picks out the one with the best profit in the store and shakes it out to you. Then you have been fooled. So, when buying material, first, determine how much money per foot you are willing to spend. Second, ask the store clerk for a few samples to look at in order to compare the fabric and calculate the price. Don't think that "the high price is the good product." So, if you don't know how to buy, it's better to go to a woolen fabric shop with non-negotiable prices. If you know how to bargain and are buying ordinary woolen fabrics, it is more convenient to go to the Quan Pan Street area because there are many shops to compare and you can bargain for about 30 cents. If you are buying high-end clothing materials, it is best to go to woolen fabric shops in the Outer Bridge area, because all the Western clothing stores in the city get their goods from them (showing samples to the Western clothing stores). Therefore, the quality of the woolen fabric is good. However, they mostly only sell double widths (imported woolen fabrics are originally double width for the convenience of making Chinese clothes, so they are cut in half into single widths, without a width). When buying, it is best to buy with a partner, which is the same as each buying a single width. When discussing the price, it is better to specify the price per unit than per foot. For example, if you want to cut a robe from a double-width material and two people buy it together, cutting 5 yards is enough. Using feet, it is 9.5 feet. Nowadays, most people use city feet. Store clerks use "flying feet" (exaggerated measurements), which seems like a lot, but it is still the same. Using yardsticks has fewer drawbacks. However, one thing is that the yardstick must be a Deke yardstick (2.6 feet, used when Zhan Zhong imports goods). If you use their own-made yardstick, it is only 2.5 feet. In other words, woolen fabric shops also have two kinds of yardsticks, one for importing goods and one for selling goods. In this import and export, they have already taken one inch from each yard. If we customers also ask him to use the Deke yardstick, he will be less likely to profit.</p>
<h3 id="e194">Wheat Futures Market Turns Bullish <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market was extremely quiet in the morning, with only the July contract opening a few times. The rest of the months were auctioned off empty. When the afternoon session opened, although trading was not much, the market atmosphere seemed lively. Because the foreign wheat quotation was slightly better, hedging was watching and hesitant, and off-market short sellers covered their positions more, so the asking price was high. However, in reality, there is very little basis for this situation to rise. As a result, the current month was better than the previous week by 1 fen, March was better by 2 fen, April was better by 3 fen, and July was better by 2 fen.</p>

<p>(Eleventh) Chicago wheat rose due to strong Winnipeg wheat and poor winter production. Also, 10 million bushels were traded on the 10th. The market conditions for the 11th are listed below:</p>
<p>Closing Price Compared to the Previous Day:</p>
<p>May: 47.750, up 0.250</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was stable due to firm tender prices. However, public association clearing transactions were unusually sluggish, with only asking prices and very few transactions. It is also heard that the local South Goods industry has a firm intention to temporarily suspend imports before the new scale problem is resolved. Therefore, the market is even quieter. The asking price for 24 coarse white sugar was 15.7 liang, and for high-quality goods, it was 8 qian. The asking price for No. 20 and No. 18 medium white sugar was 15.3 to 15.4 qian, and for No. 890 Dutch red sugar, it was 12.3 to 12.4 qian. There were few domestic green, red, and white sugar and Jianbing (rock sugar) offerings. The sluggishness of the market is unprecedented.</p>
<h3 id="e197">The Market Price of Quanzhou's Big Bubble Longan, Sold at the North Gate, Diverges from its Origin <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>Quanzhou's Big Bubble Longan, in past years, has always had a turning point during the New Year's red plate. This year's first round, in addition to the slightly higher prices for medium and lower grades, the rest of the grades have not opened up at the original price, showing a tired sign. However, according to the local situation, a divergent situation has formed. The Hua Ping ship only arrived with 327 boxes, and according to a letter, the local price has risen by 2 to 3 yuan. This is because the harvest last year was too abundant, and the branches and leaves were scorched, and some had even withered. In addition, heavy frost fell, and buds have not yet sprouted. According to general observation, this year's harvest will definitely be poor. Therefore, the owners of the goods are all hoping for higher prices and are unwilling to sell cheaply. However, local sales in Shanghai have not been smooth, making it difficult to improve for a while.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Oil Market - Asphalt Soars <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>Last Year, Various Regions Reported a Shortage; Zhejiang Route Production Area Purchased From Outside</p>
<p>Last year, various regions reported a shortage of asphalt. At the end of the market, there was no inventory in Hankou, Shanghai, and Hangzhou. It was generally expected that the spring market would inevitably rise. The Zhejiang route took the lead, and Hangzhou merchants went out to purchase goods, starting from Jiaxing, Zhejiang West, and then to Shanghai and Hankou. It is estimated that about 1,000 pieces were purchased from Jiaxing, starting from 27 to 28 yuan per dan to 32 to 33 yuan. Shanghai also had 1,000 pieces of heavy hemp, starting from 18 liang to 20 liang. Macheng started from 17 liang to 19 liang. About 6,000 to 7,000 pieces were purchased in Hankou, with heavy hemp from 15.6 liang to 18 liang, and Macheng from 13 liang to 16 liang. In total, Hangzhou merchants purchased about 10,000 pieces abroad within half a month. As the Zhejiang route is originally an oil-producing area, the fact that they are now purchasing from outside indicates that the production area has been greatly reduced. Given that the Zhejiang route only has the source of Hankou, and Hangzhou, Suzhou, Zhenjiang, Ningbo, and the local area all purchase from Hankou, the Hankou market has become chaotic and prices have risen chaotically. Also, at the time when the inventory at the end of the year was extremely thin, the source of supply was blocked by ice and snow. Whenever goods arrived, there was a scramble to buy them, regardless of the price, but only seeking the goods. The goods along the way were sold out before they even arrived. According to the details in yesterday's Hankou letter, 1,500 to 1,600 pieces of heavy hemp and 2,000 pieces of Macheng have been confirmed but not delivered. A large number have not been purchased. Currently, transactions are temporarily suspended, and sales will resume only after the confirmed purchases have been cleared and there are surplus goods. As the amount of goods in transit and the date of arrival cannot be determined, merchants are afraid to sell them in advance. It is estimated that heavy hemp will have to be delivered at 19 liang or more. Recently, only a small number of Pianfeng Macheng have been offered at a price of 17 liang. Subsequent goods were priced at 17.4 liang, while previous goods were generally priced at 18 liang. However, as various regions see that there is no spot oil to buy in Hankou, even with daily letters and telegrams urging purchases, there is no effect and they can only wait quietly.</p>

<p>Recently, the spring silk selling season has arrived, and the demand for rayon from various silk weaving factories in the interior has increased sharply, with sales reaching smoothly. Yesterday, silk merchants from Hangzhou and Huzhou in the public association again imported 47 boxes of current and forward goods of medium and high-quality snow dragon and other brands of rayon from France and other countries at prices ranging from 132.75 to 147.5 liang. The market plate is increasingly showing a firm appearance.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the foreign firm silk market in the local port was calm and flat. This was because the telegrams of period and spot silk sent to overseas countries by various European and American firms still needed time to be transferred. Various European firms, in view of the silk thread factories in New York and Lyon, purchased their raw materials as needed, and the price of period silk was not much different from the price of spot silk. Therefore, general hoarders held the view that they would not buy the period silk unless it was cheap. Chinese silk merchants had high costs and large losses, and maintained their stance as before. The market atmosphere was calm.</p>
<h3 id="e201">Hardware, Overseas Tinplate Continues to Rise <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>Recently, hardware and various goods have seen frequent transactions due to the economic situation and the purchase of Jinling and Hanyang military factories in Shanghai. Among them, military supplies are the most, such as white lead skin, black iron skin, tinplate, triangular iron, new lead wire, etc. There is also some embellishment for water cement and refined spirits. Therefore, the market situation is good. However, there were very few transactions by customer groups and construction groups yesterday, due to the influence of late money shop loans. The market conditions, on the other hand, saw more increases than decreases. For example, half-fen 7.5-li steel plates rose another 2.5 qian, with half-fen estimated at 6.75 liang, and 7.5-li at 6.5 liang. Tinplate also rose by 2 to 3 qian. The estimated price of 90-pound British goods was 13.1 liang, 100-pound was 13.75 liang, 90-pound American goods were 14.9 liang, 100-pound was 16 liang, and 200-pound Huisi iron was 26 liang. However, there were not many goods on the market, and after the price increase, the standard may rise again. Other items, such as Qing lead, also turned up 1 qian, estimated at 12 liang, and 26-gauge British white iron also rose to 12 liang. The estimated price of No. 2 white lead skin was 27.25 liang. As for the price decreases, only a few items such as Dian Xi (spot tin) were seen. However, according to overseas telegraphic communications yesterday, the price of tinplate continued to rise by 2 to 3 shillings, with the price of 90-pound boxes estimated at 17 shillings 5 pence, 100-pound boxes at 18 shillings 2 pence, 180-pound boxes at 1 pound 16 shillings 2 pence, 160-pound boxes at 1 pound 15 shillings 9 pence, and 200-pound boxes at 1 pound 18 shillings. It is heard that those in the same industry are afraid to start adding orders because their market conditions are rising too fast. Therefore, in recent days, apart from inquiries, there have been no actual transactions.</p>

<h3 id="e224">Dragon Lanterns <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— Sha Tuo</p>
<p>Although it’s close to spring, outside the window it's still wind and snow. I sit in the upstairs room, surrounded by a desolate silence, thinking of the scene of the first month in the mountains; as usual, these few days are for the dragon lantern procession.</p>
<p>In the mountains, performing the dragon lantern procession is not a simple matter. Not only is it just once a year, but it is also the only outdoor competition for the strong young men of the mountains. The city has dragon boat races in May, but the mountains have nothing like that.</p>
<p>From the day before the Lantern Festival until the seventeenth, people from far and near wear their brand new spring clothes and rush to the town for the dragon procession. No matter how far they come from, they don't have to worry about food and lodging. Those with relatives naturally go to their relatives’ homes for New Year's greetings, and even strangers or passersby without relatives will be welcomed with smiling faces. During these four days, every household in the town has an obligation to provide food and lodging, and the more generous the hospitality, the better. After dinner, as the lanterns are about to be lit, the streets are already packed with people, the old leaning on chairs, the young jumping around, and the girls with their braids shyly avoiding the gazes of strangers. Regardless of whether it's sunny or rainy, cold or warm, everyone is equally happy. If the blue sky is like a wash, and the round moon is overhead, that would naturally be even better. In addition to the lantern light and the shadows of people, adding the moonlight like water, everyone becomes even more enthusiastic.</p>
<p>While waiting quietly, the sound of gongs and drums comes from far to near. The cloth dragon, more than twenty yards long, passes by with its teeth and claws bared. Everyone doesn't just scatter after one look, as the best part is yet to come. Those with houses sit by the windows to watch, those without houses crowd to the village entrance to see the dragon cross the creek. One dragon dances on the bridge, and another dragon swims underwater. The lantern light makes the creek water glow red, a bit dazzling. After crossing the creek, the dragon crawls into the mysterious and dark forest. The lantern light flickers uncertainly among the branches and leaves, and after a while, it winds around behind the mountain.</p>
<p>The grandmother tells her daughter-in-law to make more tea, the guests from the bottom of the mountain munch on pumpkin seeds freshly brought from the county seat, the older children set off firecrackers, and the younger children clamor to sleep. The mother gently coaxes them: [Don't sleep, wait for the dragon to return, and it will bless you to grow quickly, to grow as tall as your father.]</p>
<p>The dragon is returning! The children sit on their parents' shoulders, looking up at the mountain ridge. At first, only a red glow rises, then a dragon's head appears, and sections of the dragon's belly emerge from the back of the mountain. The silent valley suddenly turns red like a wildfire. The mountain ridge is winding, and the dragon follows the ridge as it crawls down, looking like lightning on a June night, or like a golden thread. After the dragon's tail is finished turning, the dragon's head is already halfway down the mountain. This is when the excitement starts, with firecrackers being set off in front of every house, and children and women all bowing down to the dragon, while the dogs throughout the village bark non-stop towards the mountain.</p>
<p>Afterwards, the dragon returns to the temple, and this is when everyone goes to sleep. Except for the head of the household, everyone can sleep until noon, preparing for the second and third nights of staying up.</p>
<p>The Lantern Festival is the happiest few days for the children, but also the most melancholic days. After the seventeenth, everyone has to take off their new clothes and start working.</p>
<p>Thinking of the joyous events in the mountains while in Shanghai, it’s not just the dragon procession. But in this flurry of spring snow, I wonder if the dragon procession is still being performed well on the old mountain ridge?</p>

<p>The China League for Civil Rights Protection established a branch in Beiping and spent a lot of effort to rescue many students who were arrested for resisting Japan and opposing imperialism. The Beiping Municipal Party Committee therefore suggested that it was an illegal organization.</p>
<p>Law, it seems, comes in many kinds. Near Shanghai, people often sell "Fuyang Law" [a type of local pastry], and throughout China, there are people who know a magic trick that everyone can learn. In the story of "San Niang Teaches Her Son," there is even a bamboo stick for beating children called "family law." These laws are what we are accustomed to. As for the law of the spirit of rule of law, the law of legislation and justice, we only see them in the names of various committees, on the signboards of government offices, and in newspaper orders. The true embodiment of the law, the just public trial, the judgment of right and wrong, seems to be rarely encountered in Chinese society and politics. In foreign paintings, the goddess of law has a cloth covering her eyes and is holding a balance in her hand. I think that if we were to paint this goddess in China, we could copy the foreign painting completely, but we would have to add some gun barrels or gold-made weights to the scales in her hand.</p>
<p>The several cases that the China League for Civil Rights Protection has recently been striving to oppose and assist with are well known to everyone: 1) the murder of Zhenjiang journalist Liu Yusheng; 2) the arrest of students and workers for resisting Japanese imperialist aggression; 3) the detention of political prisoners for fighting for political freedom of speech, publication, assembly, association, and demonstration, etc. To determine whether the League is illegal or non-illegal, we must first ask whether the things it opposes are illegal or non-illegal.</p>
<p>Therefore, we must ask: Was the murder of Liu Yusheng illegal or not? Is the Manchukuo a legitimate organization that we should all recognize and support? Should freedom of speech, publication, etc., be granted to the people in law?</p>
<p>China has reached a period full of crises. Everyone should wake up. Hiding in the corner and making trouble, are you really not afraid of the coming dawn?</p>

<p>— Li Shengyue</p>
<p>It's probably because Chinese emperors were too afraid of kicking the bucket that they always liked their subjects to call them [Long Live]. The two characters [Long Live] became the exclusive title of the emperor in successive dynasties, just as the character [朕] became the emperor's exclusive first person pronoun. In fact, [Long Live] was not necessarily a respectful term for the emperor in the beginning. Those who have read Han Feizi probably remember that [Long Live] was originally just a kind of congratulatory term used by shamans. The use of [Long Live] as a respectful term for the emperor probably began in the Han Dynasty. When Grand General Wei Zhen of Emperor Xian was awe-inspiring and famous, a group of officials in Chang'an prostrated themselves before him and called out [Long Live]. A good-for-nothing named Han Leng blushed and protested, saying, [Can ministers call each other [Long Live]?] It can be seen that at that time, [Long Live] was not something that could be shouted casually.</p>
<p>I often feel that the psychology of [Long Live] and the emperor's fear of death is extremely contradictory, because as soon as these two words are uttered, they are cursing the emperor that even if he lives to ten thousand years, he will still inevitably kick the bucket (die), just like congratulating a commoner's son on [living to be a hundred years old], which contains the same malicious curse. A commoner's life is worthless, and living to a hundred years is considered long life. Compared to the emperor's ten thousand years, it is indeed like the cicada or mayfly that does not know spring and autumn. However, in the endless torrent of time, ten thousand years is only like a hundred steps compared to fifty steps, because sooner or later everyone will die!</p>
<p>Now is the era of the Republic, and Emperor Xuantong's [queue sovereignty] has already kicked the bucket. Smart people then, based on the principle of [Chinese learning for the essence, Western learning for practical use], re-translated the two characters [Long Live] from foreign languages and applied them everywhere. People not only do not find these two characters feudal and annoying, but consider them fresh and fashionable. This can probably echo the two characters [Revolution], which have been turned from old to new one after the other. But the ultimate meaning of [Long Live] always has a bit of a somber taste.</p>
<p>Westerners are indeed much smarter than us. They do not use finite numbers as congratulatory terms, so they do not feel that there is still a [taste of death] in the end. For example, the British shout [Long live the King!]. The French shout [Vive la Republique! (Long live the Republic)]. The German royalists enthusiastically shout [Es lebe der Konig! (Long live the German Emperor)]. Soviet workers fervently shout [Da Zdrevstvuet Proletarskaya Revolyutsiya (Long live the proletarian revolution)]. According to the original meaning of words such as Long live, vive, etc., they are all congratulating something or other on living or living long. Compared to the Chinese shouting of something or other [ten thousand years], they do not feel a chill. Therefore, although the translation of the two characters [Long Live] is skillfully done, it is somewhat of an ancient person's mistake, from which the difficulty of translation can also be seen!</p>
<p>The short Easterners are even worse than us. Like parrots learning to speak, they stole the essence of Chinese culture [Long Live] and silently turned Wansai into the voiced Banzai. Last year, thousands of Korean children waved the sun flag in Hongkou and shouted Banzai Tennobaai (Long live the Emperor) to the new Japanese reinforcements arriving in Shanghai. Thinking of it now, I still sigh at the fact that the short ones are incorrigible. But these short ones not only shout [Long Live the Emperor] themselves in a dull-witted way, but are now frantically forcing others to bark along with them. Didn't famous traitors such as Yu Chonghan and Xie Jieshi lead a group of [Manchukuo] beauties and handsome men to Tokyo last year, shouting Fenno Banzai? I don't know what the traitors will call the young Xuantong, but if the restoration is successful, they will probably only be able to give him a nauseating [Thousand Years] at most.</p>
<p>Finally, let me bring the topic back to the beginning. Although I personally feel that [Long Live] is a bit unlucky, we will temporarily continue to use the two characters [Long Live] until there is a suitable word to translate [Long live...]. However, we do not hope that those who use the bones of the common people to make their thrones will [Long Live]; but we hope and pray that the systems and ideas that represent justice and truth will [Long Live]! Ten thousand years, ten thousand years, to infinity. Let the two characters [Long Live] also [Long Live] forever: [Long Live] Long Live!</p>

<p>— Gan</p>
<p>"May Heaven punish me and the earth destroy me, may I be a male thief and a female prostitute" – this is the classic Chinese oath, almost like "The Book of Poetry says," "Confucius said." Today's oaths, "[swear to kill the enemy, swear to resist to the death, swear...]" seem to not use these kinds of idioms.</p>
<p>But the substance of swearing is still the same, which is that you can't trust it. They know full well that Heaven is not necessarily going to punish them, and the earth is not necessarily going to destroy them. Nowadays, even ginseng is [scientifically made] by including electricity, so how can [Heaven and Earth] not be scientific! As for male thieves and female prostitutes, that is not only harmless but also beneficial; male thieves can acquire several more layers of land, and female prostitutes can get a few more positions for [relatives of officials].</p>
<p>My old friend said: Your explanations of [thief] and [prostitute] are not the ancient meanings. I said - you know what era this is! This is an era where thieves are modern, and prostitutes are modern, so swearing is also modern, and has turned into oaths.</p>

<p>Even Ghosts Advocate for Vernacular Chinese</p>
<p>Dr. Hu Mingfu was the most promising scientist in our country, but unfortunately, he died by drowning on June 13, 1927. The Science Society of China held a special social funeral for him. Mr. Yang Xingfo's epitaph for Hu Mingfu reads: [Knowledge is boundless, but life is finite, I wish to burn myself to create the light of mankind. While the world is drunk on wealth and honor, Mr. is dedicated to the unknown. When strength is exhausted, the heart is at peace, death and success are not worth discussing. The river flows endlessly, and the mountain colors are eternally green. For thousands and ten thousands of years, protect this good city forever. For thousands and ten thousands of years, protect this good city forever.] If the dead really have knowledge, they may not approve of such clichés and stock phrases. But to say the dead have no knowledge? They can actually give oracles and advocate for vernacular Chinese. Ms. Hu Binxia's brief biography of her late brother, Mingfu, states: [During spirit writing, I asked whether this piece should be written in classical or vernacular Chinese, and he replied vernacular, so I followed his advice.] Since the deceased was a scientist, and this article is published in a science magazine, as if spirit writing truly has ghostly possession, is it not a great strange thing? Even ghosts advocate for vernacular Chinese; I will send this message to Hu Shi.</p>
<p>Four Hu Yunyi's Hao Lu Teacher</p>
<p>One day, my friend Wu Qiren asked me if Hu Yunyi's Hao Lu teacher was Huang Pei? I stared blankly, not knowing how to answer. Mr. Wu immediately took Hu's book "Research on Song Ci" from the bookshelf and showed it to me, page 166, the entry on the lyricist Jiang Baishi, where it was seen that the author quoted [Hao Lu Teacher saying: The presence of Baishi in lyric poetry is like the presence of Changli in prose.] I said; [This is probably Xu Hao Lu of the prosperous Qing Dynasty, the Hao Lu teacher who was often praised by Zhang Yongchuan, the author of Cilin Jishi.] Mr. Wu then took out Cilin Jishi and checked the Jiang Kui entry, and indeed saw a small note quoting [Hao Lu Teacher saying; The presence of Baishi in lyric poetry is like the presence of Changli in prose. It is also fitting that the world regards those who consider Changli to be contrived and awkward also consider Baishi to be stiff.] Mr. Wu laughed and said; [Fortunately, I am contemporary with Mr. Hu. If Mr. Hu had been born one hundred and forty to fifty years earlier, I would have believed that Xu Hao Lu had gained another highly talented disciple besides Zhang Zongpu.] Mr. Wu has authored research on "Rou Pu Tuan" and also authored a defense that Confucius was not born from an improper union, in order to correct the errors of past commentators of Shiji, making him a person with both a historical obsession and an obsession with textual research.</p>

<p>"It's really annoying! You know I live in Fort Taiwan. Because there is a one-hour class at H Liang College today, scheduled from eight to nine. But in your school, classes are only in the afternoon at three o'clock. Once I come out, I have to go back and come out again, which not only costs more money for transportation but also wastes time. So after class at the Japan Academy, I have no choice but to go to your school's library to kill this half-day. Shanghai's professor life is really not a human life! ... Last night I prepared several courses and went to bed after twelve o'clock. After lying down in bed, I became restless and couldn't sleep. I tossed and turned until two or three o'clock before falling asleep. Today I have a terrible headache, a terrible headache!"</p>
<p>As Mr. Zhu spoke of having a terrible headache, he twitched his nose, bit his molars, and knitted his brows. "Just one hour at H College? Wouldn't it be better to not take the job? This way, it's too hard on you, isn't it?"</p>
<p>Haiquan couldn't help but feel sympathetic when he heard Mr. Zhu complaining.</p>

<p>"That's not much. Wouldn't it be better to quit?"</p>

<p>Mr. Zhu smiled bitterly and sighed deeply, as if hating that Haiquan had no understanding of the professors' suffering, and was speechless for a moment. But after a while, Mr. Zhu smiled again and said:</p>
<p>"Three twos are six, three eights are twenty-four, three fives are fifteen, a total of eight yuan, five jiao, and five fen.

<h3 id="e230">China Will Not Perish <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>Recently, people have often predicted that China will inevitably perish, and even in my opinion, it seems very possible. This, of course, refers to perishing in the kowtows and obeisances of some important figures, and will certainly not simply fade away without any incident. However, in the past few days, I have become a bit doubtful; I feel that China may not necessarily perish, and you never know. Haven't even the sister-in-law of the Manchurian emperor become patriotic?</p>
<p>According to reports, the puppet Puyi's sister-in-law, Pu Tang Shixia, is willing to reconcile with her husband, Pu Jie, because: [Since he (Jie) went to Japan for studies, for several years, Xia has been trapped in Beiping, and eunuch servants have deliberately provoked discord. The family patriarch listened to slanderous words and often heard things that made Xia unable to feel at ease.] Moreover, [When Puyi was taken east by the Japanese, he had tearfully pleaded with the family patriarch beforehand, but the family patriarch instead criticized Xia for being nosy,] so this female hero who deeply understands righteousness [had no choice but to leave the mansion alone, preferring to be a lonely soul of China rather than be a relative of the puppet emperor, and therefore going to Changchun was absolutely impossible]. However, it is not completely without room for turning around, as it says later: [If my husband cherishes the love of our married life and comes to Shanghai to be with Xia, Xia will advocate on his behalf to those in power, and it will not be difficult for him to have a foothold. Otherwise, if he fails temporarily, he will be discredited along with his colleagues, leaving behind the condemnation of posterity, and there will be no place for him to stand at home or abroad.]</p>
<p>Judging from this great principle, that she does not go to the Northeast is of course because she [prefers to be a lonely soul of China rather than be a relative of the puppet emperor,] not to mention that this woman is commendable. Just from these two sentences, we are worthy of erecting a stone memorial arch for her to spread her benevolence to ten thousand ages and thousands of autumns, not to mention that when Puyi went east, she had tearfully pleaded with him, so it is even more commendable and worthy of tears. In addition, the bitter rain and cold wind of being trapped in Beiping for several years, this situation and this scene, can be imagined. However, there is still the love of married life. If that person can come to Shanghai and be with her, she will still not hesitate to advocate on his behalf to those in power. This part, of course, will not be bragging, as the public officials in charge of reason will naturally not find it difficult to turn around and make arrangements for him. Therefore, both loving the country and reuniting, the beautiful things in the world, there should be nothing better than this. However, upon further thought, the so-called [leaving behind the condemnation of posterity] part, Ms. Tang need not worry too much about. Who cares about the affairs of posterity? Moreover, this has the same effect as [leaving a fragrant name for a thousand years], is it not also praised by people in the same way? Moreover, relatives of the puppet emperor are, after all, hard to come by. How many lives can one have? Why not fully savor the taste of it?</p>
<p>However, all said and done, the foundation of China is still reliable, because even our imperial relatives have surprisingly become patriotic.</p>

<p>— Ms. Bingqing</p>
<p>On an afternoon after a rainy day, I led our newly hired servant to my alma mater to pick up my younger brother.</p>
<p>I silently dragged a pair of heavy, broken cotton boots, looking down at the muddy street, picking out the drier spots to step on. In my heart, I only felt that the boots were too heavy and clumsy.</p>
<p>Turning a corner, I could already see that majestic and towering alma mater in the distance. I turned my head back and said to him, [Do you see it?] [That's it.]</p>
<p>It was still early, and there were still thirty minutes before school was dismissed. I was impatient to wait, so I only led him to my brother's classroom and instructed him to [be careful on the road], and then I hurriedly left. When passing by the doorway of the teachers' room for the middle and high grade levels, I sneakily walked closer and peeked into the window. Although I wasn't looking for Mr. Jiang [my former homeroom teacher] to talk, I really wanted to see his respected face. I felt that Mr. Jiang's kind of rigorous and peaceful attitude was unmatched by anyone else.</p>
<p>In that row by the window, the window of the last seat let in a dim light. It seemed unwilling to shine on other teachers, only shining on the shoulder of a female teacher wearing black clothes. Who else could this upright and noble teacher be but Mr. Jiang? I didn't want to go in and interrupt the valuable time that he was enthusiastically putting his spirit into correcting students' papers.</p>
<p>In this glimpse outside the window, indescribable sweet, sour, bitter, and spicy flavors welled up in my heart. I seemed to want to laugh, and I seemed to want to cry. How could I, who is barely literate, describe this moment that is difficult to speak of?</p>
<p>I only felt that I was not blessed enough to receive the guidance of this motherly teacher. In this glimpse, I seemed to see a great man of the world. When I came out, I only felt honored and happy.</p>

<p>A solitary thatched hut stands on the river island, daring to compare itself to Duke Wen encountering Jizhou. When successful, the blue clouds let loose and carefree, but when heartbroken by the sorrow of rain, one loses restraint. Poetry and books are useful and should be hidden in the walls, Heaven and Earth have not turned around, so bear entering the boat. The most beautiful thing is that the flowers are still blooming throughout the yard, and the tall paulownia trees above the well have already sensed the coming of autumn.</p>
<p>··············</p>
<p>Riding a thin horse alone, I return to my thatched eaves, filled with ten thousand signatures of blue silk. A withered beard scratches the remnants of the changing dynasty, and a long hoe loads the old snow and frost. Tribulus thorns have long困杨亿, The wind and moon will eventually be with Xie Qian. Ten acres of gray smoke is enough for life, and the tribute should not reach the poor alleys. I quickly put away half a lifetime of splendor and enjoyment, and unveiling my traces turns to purity and seclusion. Opening the window to draw the earth allows me to wave my sleeves, and scattering my hair tomorrow I want to play on a boat. A single pole of drizzle resembles the Pu River, and a short wall three feet high is the Tuqiu. Who is holding the mirror with white hair? Shaming the adventures of those years.</p>
<p>··········</p>
<p>I once built a cottage next to Shanglin, but now I am surprised to have fallen into the wild marshes. The wind and rain shake the bed, and my body is like a寄, The beacon fire dazzles the eyes, and the invaders are already deep. Poetry and fu, the tears of guests at Jiangguan, orchids and iris, the heart of exiled officials by the Ze River. A lead knife has not yet been cut, and my years are declining, and I cannot suppress the angry tide for long.</p>

<p>— Xian</p>
<p>Dear Friend:</p>
<p>When I received your gift, even though it was already the third day after our marriage, I still sincerely thank you for being so thoughtful. These many exquisite gifts, in the eyes of inland people, are probably as valuable as gold, silver, and jewels. My wife also exclaimed happily, and it took her three hours to arrange them properly. At that time, my mood was certainly different from when I am writing this letter.</p>

<p>We have been friends for three or four years, and now we have become husband and wife, so our personalities, interests, and ambitions should be familiar. After living together, just as you said, the joy in one room is harmonious. But an unexpected tragedy? Shattered my beautiful dream 丨 My wife has lost her virginity. Dear friend, don't laugh at me for being pedantic. In this day and age, talking about virginity seems too outdated. But under certain circumstances, virginity is still virginity. We have had three or four years of friendship, and in the course of those three or four years, love has proceeded openly. Originally, in a state of love, there should be no consciousness of concealment or deception. My wife has loved me passionately for three or four years, and I have loved her, but she did not tell me about this. After I discovered it, she even made all sorts of excuses, obviously wanting to shift this unfounded responsibility onto my shoulders. Dear friend, not</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>to say cynical words, but if she had explained it earlier, I would not have ruined the love we had built up over three or four years. Love should be open, and she has given me too much disappointment 丨 Since arguing about this matter, the fun and passion of our honeymoon have become as cold as ice. Whether we can restore the blessing of harmonious joy in one room in the future will at least include some element of bitter laughter. Love is open, my friend. I based the virginity issue on this point and brought it up under these circumstances.</p>
<p>Now, let's put aside our private affairs and move on to say that chastity is the responsibility of both men and women 丨 Whether it be in morality or love, to preserve it on average. In my nearly thirty years of life, I have not lost my chastity: I am a man (excuse me for saying a traditional concept), and in an environment where it is relatively easy to lose chastity, I have not abandoned myself and violated it. But women lightly sell their chastity, which is painful to say 丨 Furthermore, if men and women are violated and coerced into losing their chastity, the law has considerable protection rights. But in the process of love, it should be open.</p>
<p>Now I am trying hard not to let this matter be a bone of contention between us husband and wife. Spring has already come, and if you are interested, come and play in these mountains for a few days. It would be even better if your wife could come with you. Having a few more companions to travel the mountains can make the joy in the mountains harmonious, right?</p>

<p>— Quality</p>
<p>A Scene from Beggar Life</p>
<p>["Ahua, damn it,"] a man of about forty, draped with a piece of burlap on his upper body and wearing dark, single-layered trousers, cursed anxiously towards a group of people who looked just like him: ["Tonight, we're going to die here,"].</p>
<p>The whistling of the wind from the power lines and the chattering of their teeth played in unison like a painful lament. The old man's groans seemed to have attracted the attention of the crowd. ["Uncle Bing, good, let's stack ourselves like last night."] The young Ahua, seemingly worldly-wise, forced a smile and answered his uncle; at the same time, he looked at the crowd, hoping they would agree with his suggestion.</p>
<p>White snowflakes fell from the dark sky. The usually dim streetlights were now showing their ability. A pile of pale-faced people sat and lay in front of a tall building. Their clothes were mostly different, but they were all shivering.</p>
<p>["Oh, I don't want to stack again."] Old Bing sighed slightly and then said: ["You young people can take it, but I haven't slept for two nights... Oh! Heaven... I wonder how many days are left."] The chattering of his teeth blurred his words.</p>
<p>["Old Bing, I think some big bosses will come to save us."] A middle-aged man with unusually long, dishevelled hair and a face covered in mud sat up, brushing the snow off his body with one hand and clenching his teeth hard to comfort Old Bing. ["We will have good luck one day..."]</p>
<p>["Old Bing, are you cold? I'll give you this."] Another young man with bright eyes and gnashing teeth took off his coat and threw it at Old Bing. He seemed to be protesting against fate. ["Damn it, I'm not convinced!"]</p>
<p>["Little Dog Wang, thank you, what about yourself!"] ["I must go to the company tomorrow, no matter what."] Little Dog Wang continued to speak angrily: ["No, weren't you afraid today? When you saw the foreigners..."] Ahua asked haltingly: ["Kid, I'm not afraid of heaven or earth. Their cars haven't come out these past few days."]</p>
<p>["In that case, we have no hope of getting in. We deserve to freeze to death!"] The middle-aged man said angrily and resentfully. After a few minutes of tension, the feeling of disappointment began to ease again. Old Bing stopped groaning. He had curled up into a ball. Little Dog Wang and Ahua were excitedly playing on the snow-covered virgin ground, even though the snowflakes were falling even harder.</p>
<p>...Wild pheasant rides in a chartered car, pretending to be a concubine...</p>
<p>...I was originally in Wolonggang...</p>
<p>× × × × ×</p>
<p>The heavy dung cart began to talk to the snow. The rustling footsteps woke Ahua from his dream. He rubbed his eyes, reached out, and pinched Little Dog Wang's nose. ["Little..."] Dog Wang, Little Dog Wang, you still want to tell stories at night, what..."]</p>
<p>["Bah! You harmful thing."] Little Dog Wang turned over and fell asleep again.</p>
<p>["Sigh! A life is not even as good as a dog's, how cold!"] Ahua cursed at the sky for a while and then lay down on the ground.</p>
<p>["Mama, I want food..."]</p>
<p>["Sir, I'm freezing to death, starving to death."]</p>
<p>The muddled words woke the middle-aged man with particularly long hair. When he sat up, he found that the back of his head was completely soaked in a pile of white liquid. Before curiosity could arise, overwhelming fear had conquered him. He couldn't help but crawl to Ahua's side.</p>
<p>["Ahua! Ahua! Your uncle is not well!"] ["What, did the foreigners catch him?"] The fierce cry caused him to ask an involuntary question, half-awake and confused.</p>
<p>["No, he's dead, his body is not warm anymore!"]</p>
<p>["What? What?"] Ahua hurriedly and frantically pushed his uncle Old Bing's body.</p>
<p>Soon, a large crowd of sorrowful spectators gathered in front of the door where death had arrived the night before.</p>
<p>The next day, a news item was published in the newspaper:</p>
<p>["Due to the heavy snowfall and sudden cold weather in recent days, the temperature is below zero degrees. The number of beggars who freeze to death every day has broken past records. Last night, one person also froze to death in front of the ××× Road ×× Mansion. The scene was terrible. It is heard that a philanthropist, etc., has initiated a poor people's relief center to benefit these people..."]</p>

<p>Plums are falling, seven of them are left! Let the gentlemen seek me, while the day is auspicious! Plums are falling, three of them are left! Let the gentlemen seek me, while today lasts!

<p>Elementary school students want to marry middle school students, middle school students want to marry college students, college students want to marry students studying abroad, and students studying abroad want to marry Ph.D.s. Our Miss Xiang is no exception. Miss Xiang is a middle school student and, of course, is qualified to marry a college student. Recently, Miss Xiang met Mr. C, a graduate of ×× University. In less than two or three days, they had a meeting, either playing mahjong or going to the cinema. This mahjong and cinema seemed to be the steps they were taking towards engagement. Before they met, their siblings-in-law worked hard to mediate, with the feeling that ["The engagement has not yet succeeded, and mediation is still needed."]. The first step was to use the cinema to get them acquainted. It would not be too late to get engaged after the fruit was ripe. That day, Mr. C invited Miss Xiang and her siblings-in-law to watch Laurel and Hardy's "Old Soldiers" at the R cinema. Miss Xiang dressed up with particular effort that day, especially on her eyebrows, as the poem says:</p>
<p>Cleverly drawn eyebrows, delicate and charming,</p>
<p>Her makeup is not yet complete, resembling a Jiang Pavilion in the morning,</p>
<p>Distant mountains are brushed with emerald green, palace curtains are rolled up in the evening,</p>
<p>Her eyes are like horizontal hooks, she finds the ink too dark, and the powder too pale,</p>
<p>Zhang Lang, the calligrapher, is no longer free, weary of spring, she is too weak to frown,</p>
<p>Instead, she makes a charming gesture.</p>
<p>Filling in the eyebrows cannot satisfy her autumnal longing,</p>
<p>Knowing that there is so much sorrow in the world, remembering fish-shaped letter seals,</p>
<p>Stealing glances behind her back, arranging jade hairpins together, gently moving her fingers,</p>
<p>Some have already taken the lead, long frowns are difficult to imitate,</p>
<p>Light yellow willow leaves are still there today, locked with double tips,</p>
<p>Trying to look in the mirror and admire herself, she is still charming.</p>
<p>The next day, Miss Xiang's siblings-in-law held a special banquet to treat Mr. C, and then played mahjong. A few days later, they went to the cinema again. Like this, playing mahjong today and going to the cinema tomorrow, the auspicious day for their engagement was, of course, not far away.</p>
<p>Ah, so mahjong and the cinema have such wonderful uses.</p>
<h3 id="e238">A Prisoner Hidden in a Rat's Nest <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— Jing Wu</p>
<p>I haven't seen my old friend Mr. Cheng for two years since he began serving in the capital! Recently, he returned home on business and suddenly paid me a visit the day before yesterday. Because we had been separated for so long, I couldn't help but prepare a feast to entertain him and show my hospitality. After drinking to our heart's content, we talked about current affairs and then drifted to strange stories to add to the merriment.</p>
<p>I then mentioned the article "Rat's Revenge" published in this magazine last year, saying that it was extremely rare and worthy of the word "strange story!"</p>
<p>He said: ["Speaking of 'Rat's Revenge,' I am also reminded of a story about rats: and its degree of strangeness really surpasses 'Rat's Revenge!' Furthermore, I had also seen the article 'Rat's Revenge' at the time, thinking that it was nothing more than the author using a fable to satirize the world, in order to encourage the people of the country, and to advise future generations! Who would have known that after a few days, the news of 'A Prisoner Hidden in a Rat's Nest' would be discovered in my neighbor's house in the new capital and witnessed by me. Therefore, the things in the world cannot be affirmed as impossible simply because they have not been seen! Next door to my lodgings was a shop that sold both southern goods and meat. Last year, the money counter in the meat shop was damaged by a foot, and someone was hired to repair it. As soon as it was moved, we saw the ground covered in mounds of mud, like an ant hill, with a hole the size of a bowl beside it. When we looked into it, it was very dark. When we probed it with a bamboo pole, we immediately heard a squeaking sound. We opened the hole and saw a huge rat, fat and healthy beyond compare, with bright eyes, not afraid of people at all, raising its head, wagging its tail, and standing still. After a closer examination, we realized where this rat came from. It turned out that half a year ago, an employee named X in the southern goods shop had caught a rat and, because it was so large, jokingly nailed its four feet to a piece of wood, making it into a specimen, and placed it on the counter as a joke. Unexpectedly, it disappeared overnight, and we assumed that it had undoubtedly ended up in a cat's belly! Who would have known that its own kind would rescue it, hide it in a hole, and provide it with long-term sustenance, so that it could prolong its life and remain safe for a long time. From this, it seems that it is not only full of revenge towards other species, but also full of love for its own kind!"]</p>
<p>After listening to his words, I couldn't help but feel moved. Even such a small creature actually knows to love its own kind, regardless of its own difficulties, and tries its best to rescue them! Compared to some warlords, who either do not resist when they are attacked by bandits, or turn their weapons against each other and destroy each other; who turn a blind eye to the compatriots who have fallen into the hands of the enemy in the Northeast and the righteous soldiers who are resisting the enemy! Sitting and watching the enemy's cavalry advance, and the Yuguan Pass fall! The alarm spread, shaking even Tianjin and Beijing! Such people, compared to rats, cannot help but feel ashamed of themselves!</p>
<p>Alas! If people are not as good as rats, how can they be considered human?</p>

<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>Last month, a friend from my hometown came to my house, and behind him was a young woman with a large belly. At the time, I thought this must be his new wife. So I congratulated him deeply, on the one hand blaming him for not inviting me to his wedding, and on the other hand congratulating him on the results of their collaboration: a big belly. Unexpectedly, my friend cried, just shook his head and sighed; making me completely confused; later he told me in detail. It turned out that this young woman had been my friend's neighbor since childhood; two years ago she married another man. Because her husband was away all year round, she got involved with my friend: and unexpectedly became pregnant, and could not survive in her hometown. Their original intention in coming to Shanghai was to find some work, but after a month of trying, there was still no way. As for me, it's of course not a problem to take care of them for a month or two; but after a long time, it becomes difficult to continue. They know that I can't take care of them for the rest of their lives, so they want to choose one of the following two paths.</p>
<p>(1) Resolutely return home: but the husband has already filed a lawsuit in court, offering a reward for their arrest; like moths flying into the flame, the situation is really unbearable.</p>
<p>(2) Go their separate ways: my friend, of course, still has a way, but the woman will inevitably commit suicide; to start and then abandon, is against conscience.</p>
<p>Sir: Are there any better ways besides these two? If not, which one is better? Please save them! I wish you</p>
<p>Health, Chen Qikang, respectfully</p>
<p>Editor's note: The new criminal law stipulates that ["A married woman who commits adultery with another person shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not more than two years, and the adulterer shall be punished in the same way."]. Chen's friend and this woman, of course, deserve what they get; we certainly can't think of any way for him. But on the other hand, a young woman, locked at home keeping a widow's watch, oversteps the boundaries because of sexual frustration; it is really pitiful. ["Spring is too beautiful to keep confined; a branch of red apricot extends over the wall"]; this sentence is really good!</p>
<p>We think that Chen's friend should not abandon this woman under any circumstances; because not only is this an immoral thing, but if she really commits suicide, the legal responsibility will be six or seven times heavier than the simple crime of seduction. Chen can try his best to keep them for a few more days, and try to find a way for them to make a hard living independently, this is the best policy. If it comes to the point where there is no other way, then he can only take the risk and return home resolutely. Fortunately, these kinds of lawsuits at most are only two years; if the judge is particularly lenient, it is hard to say whether they will only be sentenced for two months.</p>

<h3 id="e240">A Scholarly Family (Continued from 19) <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Zhongxian</p>
<p>(10) Loving her is indirectly loving you</p>
<p>Zhongnan questioned Youzhong for a while, and many doubts arose in him. After Youzhong left, there was only Daiqiu in the room. Zhongnan questioned her in a roundabout way, but Daiqiu also remained tight-lipped, refusing to reveal her mother's scandalous behavior. Shinan knew that soft words were ineffective, and suddenly glared his eyes, his face full of murderous intent, and snorted, saying:</p>
<p>["I have already found out that your mother is having an affair as soon as she arrives in Shanghai, what are you still hiding for her? What I don't know is what her lover's name is, you are helping her hide it, I guess you are in collusion with her!"]</p>
<p>Although Zhongnan did not shout loudly, his expression was very stern, and it was somewhat frightening to look at. Daiqiu was already holding a bellyful of grievances that she couldn't express, and she couldn't wait to vent her full belly of complaints. A sentence reached her throat, and she swallowed it down several times with saliva, but she never had the courage to say it. Now seeing this angry face, she was forced to have no choice, she had to... she had to squeeze out a few tears and burst into tears!</p>
<p>. When women encounter urgent matters, they will ask for tears to come to the rescue, especially when dealing with men. No matter how big the matter is, as long as tears are shed, all the difficult problems will be solved.</p>
<p>After Daiqiu left, Zhongnan questioned the maids again, but the result was also fruitless. The time for evening school arrived, and Maosheng came back with a schoolbag. As usual, he had to report to Zhongnan before he could get pocket money to play in the tailor shop. Zhongnan sent the maids away and kept Maosheng by his side, using the interrogation methods of a criminal lawyer to gradually go from shallow to deep, step by step, and trick him into revealing Ruohua's lover. In fact, Maosheng was a very straightforward child, and even if he was asked honestly, he would say it directly and happily. In the tailor shop, he also used Ruohua's anecdotes and scandals with Youzhong as conversation material every day, using this to trick people into giving him spiced beans. Now seeing that his father also loved to listen to this news, he was even more proud, his mouth seemed to have burst a dam, describing his mother's scandalous behavior with his uncle in detail, speaking endlessly. Zhongnan was afraid of interrupting him, so he listened to his animated lecture with a smile. But in his heart, he felt sour and painful, and he couldn't describe the sadness.</p>
<p>Zhongnan got the exact information, gave Maosheng four cents as a reward, and sent him away. He immediately called Lao Hu in and ordered him to invite Fifth Master to talk. Lao Hu went and returned, saying that Fifth Master was not at home and could not be found anywhere. That night, Ruohua returned late after playing. Zhongnan was afraid of the family scandal being spread, so he endured his anger and waited for her to finish her evening makeup. After the maids went to sleep, he called Ruohua closer, stretched out his unfailing hand, gave her a slap first, and then cursed her with gnashing teeth. Ruohua initially wanted to argue, but after Zhongnan presented a few pieces of evidence provided by Maosheng, she bowed her head and said nothing.</p>
<p>Zhongnan warned her: ["Tomorrow, I will invite my old brothers and friends to my house to announce your and Youzhong's crimes, and then publish an announcement in the newspaper to sever brotherly relations with him and to divorce you. We, the Xia family, are a scholarly family passed down from generation to generation, and have never produced such incestuous animals. In order to maintain the etiquette of my family, I will expel this animal from the clan, and I will also report to the government office to expel you this pair of adulterers and adulteresses from the country, and you will never be allowed to come back, lest you harm the local morals!"]</p>

<p>Film Special</p>
<h3 id="e241">On Emil Jannings (Part 1) <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— Robert Gao</p>
<p>"The Last Command," produced by the German Ufa company, is extraordinary for many reasons. Good material, brilliant direction, beautiful photography, harmonious use of light, proper editing, economical cutting, etc... There is, of course, a tremendous force beyond the success of the performance.</p>
<p>This great world actor, Emil Jannings, is originally a familiar face on our screen. Since 1926 until now, we have seen him many times. He first met us at the Shanghai Grand Theatre before it was renovated. The film he starred in was "Variety." Jannings' internal performance in that play caused all of his muscles to tense up, and his eyes were especially powerful. The clever director called him to perform the whole thing in a calm, natural, deep, and ruthless way, which became his masterpiece of "new edge initially tested."</p>
<p>Jannings' second work was "The Last Laugh," a play with only two subtitles, screened at Carlton. The essence of the play is entirely revealed in his performance, without the help of subtitles, and the audience can fully understand it. It is said that the two subtitles were added only in the United States. From this, we can know the amazingness of Jannings' performance. This is truly a great monument in the world film scene! In "The Last Laugh," he almost performs a solo play, every scene has his actions and expressions, but in every scene, his performance does not seem to be a little slack,</p>
<p>After he performed "The Last Laugh," he was inexplicably hired by the American Paramount Pictures Company. He starred in a total of five films at Paramount, namely "The Way of All Flesh", "The Street of Sin", "The Last Command", "The Patriot", etc. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e242">(1) Review of "Night Nurse" <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>| Carlton Screening |</p>
<p>The political phenomena of each country often consciously reflect new artistic works, and many examples can be found. In this film, for example, the social status of the United States after prohibition, especially the gentlemen and ladies of the upper class who outwardly obey and inwardly disobey this law, is powerfully and humorously exposed. At the same time, their crazy state of wine and beauty is incidentally described, revealing how they are enjoying themselves, and how they are indifferent to their children, thinking that the children are living a beautiful life under the care of nurses hired with money. Therefore, it is not surprising to take baths in milk. Moreover, the treachery and conspiracy of servants in wealthy families are also mentioned.</p>
<p>Under such a theme, the screenwriter is very able to make full use of the technique of lightly touching on the subject. Although some places are slightly lacking in strictness, the whole article is a comedy structure, so it is neither very compact nor very loose, but just a vivid sketch.</p>
<p>Of course, the director put in a lot of effort in this film, and there are many places where his cleverness is revealed. For example, the skeleton and the nurse sleeping in the same bed, although it is a joke, it can be seen its ingenuity. That is, when the head nurse comes in, we all suspect that she will find this skeleton covered by the quilt, but it is not so. The excitement given to the audience is finally intentionally lightly glossed over. It is also not appropriate to simply take off the nurse's clothes to increase the sensuality many times.</p>
<p>Barbara Stanwyck's performance is certainly worthy of appreciation. Her mellow movements and unexaggerated expressions are pleasing. In terms of supporting roles, there are no particularly commendable characters.</p>
<p>The layout is very good, especially the equipment of the rich family, which is enough to write out the comfortable life of the aristocratic woman. The light is soft and beautiful, but not particularly unique, and the pronunciation is clear. However, there is too much dialogue, which is like the taste of a stage play. Although there are many wonderful places, it is definitely not something that the average Chinese person can understand.</p>
<h3 id="e243">(2) A Friend's Wife | Nanjing Screening <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>— God</p>
<p>"A Friend's Wife", Friends Lovers, from the aspect of "name", is already enough to say "good", four famous "name" stars 丨 Adolphe Menjou, Lilian Tashman, Erich von Stroheim and Laurence Harvey 丨 plus an attractive "name", from the aspect of "reality", it has a very dramatic story, clever direction, and clever small actions.</p>
<p>The story seems a little far-fetched, simply narrating that a married young woman is dissatisfied with her husband's temperament, and at the same time unconsciously falls in love with two army officers, colleagues and good friends, who are both British troops stationed in India. They are believers of the three Ws, worshiping war, whiskey, and women, but friendship ultimately triumphs over love. All the actors are very dedicated, fully playing their roles, even the role of the servant, Olgie Hopber, has won our favor.</p>
<p>The director, as mentioned earlier, is very clever. He pays special attention to small actions, like the ending at the British general's mansion, when the two friends met Darte again, Menjou handed the cigarette case to Harvey, and Harvey was stunned and didn't know what to do, all of which are worthy of our praise. The light is very beautiful, and the sound seems to have only ninety-nine percent clarity, perhaps because the machinery in the theater had an occasional malfunction.</p>
<h3 id="e244">Barbara Stanwyck's New Work: Night Nurse <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— Mu Zhu</p>
<p>Barbara Stanwyck's works are few and far between. Only "Ladies of Leisure" and "Ten Cents a Dance" have been shown in this city. Unfortunately, I read in a magazine that she had fallen and injured her ankle while working in the photography studio at the most tense moment. After being cured by the doctor, she still limps a little when she walks. In this way, her beauty is simply damaged, and she is very annoyed and determined to leave the film industry. Who knew that after a while, she couldn't bear to leave Hollywood, so she returned to the screen. Her most recent work is "Night Nuret", which will soon be screened at Carlton.</p>

<p>Foreign films that want to be screened in the United States rarely sell out. However, last year, three foreign films actually caused a sensation in the United States. The three films are (1) Maodcbenin Uniform (the film was listed as one of the top ten films of the year by the New York Times) and (2) Dragon Soaring Phoenix Dance, which has been screened in Shanghai. (3) Road to Life. Among the three films, (1) is especially praised by the American people, and it has been selling out on Broadway for eleven consecutive weeks.</p>

<p>| That is, the German old objects are borrowed from the Finnish government |</p>
<p>Reuter Berlin, 13th. The German Ufa Film Company has recently begun to produce films about the German submarine war. The script requires a "U" submarine, but the German government currently has no submarines. The film company has to borrow a German "U" submarine obtained by Finland after the European War from the Finnish government for application.</p>

<h3 id="e247">Discussing "Such a Hero" <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Yi</p>
<p>"Such a Hero" can be said to be the first official slapstick film produced domestically, and it has considerable value for attention. I felt satisfied after watching it.</p>
<p>In this film, the directing and set design are not particularly flawed. However, in terms of the plot, there are some shortcomings. Why would the dog owner's child come downstairs at 2:00 AM to release a balloon with a funny face drawn on it? When the thief takes the box, it seems very heavy, as if it's full of things. Why can a child still hide inside later?</p>
<p>Speaking of slapstick films, they originally emphasize action and not facial expressions. In this film, the actions of the two main characters are quite successful, and their facial expressions are not too bad either.</p>
<p>Slapstick films are also very easy to become a chaotic mess. Although the plot of this film is simple, it doesn't become meaningless chaos.</p>
<p>In short, considering that China's film industry is not very developed at present, and this is the first official slapstick film, these results are still good.</p>
<h3 id="e248">The Greatness of "Sign of the Cross" <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>— Yun</p>
<p>丨Cecil B. DeMille's Representative Work丨</p>
<p>Cecil B. DeMille is a director who fully represents the American national character. He often spends thousands upon thousands of gold dollars building ancient city palaces and other sets. At the same time, he spares no expense in hiring a large number of actors to film. He is best at handling those great and well-known historical events. His successful early works are "The Ten Commandments" and "The King of Kings." His most recent miracle is "Sign of the Cross."</p>
<p>The entire performance has extremely unusual power. The actors are all top choices, like Fredric March, Elissa Landi, Claudette Colbert, and Charles Laughton, who is hailed as "the second Emil Jannings." They all give their most outstanding performances.</p>
<p>Originally, the films directed by Cecil B. DeMille are all taken seriously. When filming the bathroom of Poppaea, the extremely extravagant wife of the Roman Emperor Nero, he used a thousand gallons of milk. This is because he researched ancient books and discovered that Poppaea bathed once a day, using the milk of five hundred mules to make "fragrant soup." Not only was this the case in the palace, but when she went to other places, the five hundred mules also accompanied her. For this reason, DeMille specifically went to Southern California to find the cheapest milk. After investigation, he estimated that the price of milk was actually cheaper than the value of artificial milk made by chemical methods, so he resolutely used real milk. At the same time, Claudette Colbert, who played "Poppaea," was also relieved that her skin would not be harmed in the slightest.</p>
<p>After this milk bath was filmed, the remaining one thousand gallons of milk were used as fertilizer for irrigation.</p>
<p>At the same time, the filming time was also delayed due to a particularly heavy costume. The reason is that a costume worn by Poppaea weighed thirty-five pounds. During filming, she was always standing, serving the tyrant Nero. DeMille was afraid that she could not bear the weight, so he specifically allowed Claudette Colbert to work for one hour, rest for fifteen minutes, and then continue working.</p>
<p>The two points mentioned above only appear for a few minutes on the screen, but the filming process took so much time and effort. Here, I dare say that every inch of the film is mixed with DeMille's hard work. Because, in this film, there is not only a great performance, but also a heart-wrenching story of intensified love.</p>

<p>Hilary knew that his Ma had gone with Gray, and he stopped pretending and returned to his original state. "Good, dear Shirley, I am now a lonely child."</p>
<p>She looked at him, surprised at his composure. He didn't seem crazy at all. How could he be so calm? Yes, he was pretending to be crazy! Tears welled up in her eyes. "Father, you sacrificed yourself, leaving them! Ah, you must love her so much! But you won't be alone—I'm here."</p>
<p>Hilary stood up and walked towards her. What about Cade? "What about your marriage?"</p>
<p>"It's all settled, Father. We are in the same boat, sharing the same fate. We should stay together." He was extremely moved and stretched out his arms, holding her tightly. "My poor, dear child. I have ruined your life. But I will give you a new life. I will make you happy—we will enjoy ourselves together. You wait and see."</p>
<p>As he was speaking, Shirley heard Cade's long, clear sigh. She shuddered for a moment and walked to the window, but she only pulled down the curtains. "I can't, dear Cade," she whispered. "I can't go with you. May God bless you."</p>
<p>She returned to Hilary's side. "Father, let's play your Sonata together. Do you remember? ... It's so moving!"</p>
<p>They sat by the piano, obeying the fortunate arrangement that bound them together. Shirley's heart was shattered, but she was determined to continue her sacrifice—to maintain her father's happiness, no matter the cost. (The End)</p>
