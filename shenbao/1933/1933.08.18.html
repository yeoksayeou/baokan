<h3 id="c11">汎太平洋學會開幕後之所感（實）· <a href="#c11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>汎太平洋學會於本月十四日在加拿大阿爾伯塔州之彭夫開第屆會議。該會議原由宗敎團體發起。初意本不願涉及政治經濟等實際問題祗擬在學術上交換意見。促進太平洋沿岸諸國國民情感之聯絡。與夫文化之溝通。用意甚善。即此次大會所擬製定之議程。對中日間之糾葛問題。亦力求避免討論。并不欲在會議中引起激烈之爭辨。顧慮非不周詳。無如在此世界交通日益密切之際。無時無地不與政治經濟發生關係。况爲國際關係最複雜之太平洋沿岸乎。日本代表早與日政府發生緊密聯繫。其對一切問題所持之方針及應付步驟。亦與日本軍部之對外政策。同其步調。則其他各國之代表。爲自國立塲計。亦不能不有所發揮。以是而欲求避免政治上之討讑。恐不可得。假使現世界各國。果眞皆有純潔紳士態度。以臨國際外交。則世界經濟會議。决不至於不歡而散。此經濟會議雖與汎太平洋學會之性質不同。但其期望和平。企求國際間之合作則一也。</p>
<p>就純粹的理想上着眼。孰不願如加拿大代表范爾康氏所云。願太平洋上諸國。均能如美國與加拿大兩國間之和平。努力於國際間之睦誼。然而吾人證以過去之事實。熟察當前環境。其希望甚爲渺茫。今姑置歐洲各國對立衝突。與夫世界經濟恐慌之情勢。暫時不論。即單就太平洋上之一角。爲引動世界二次大戰爆藥庫之東三省而論。一年十個月以來。日軍縱其鐵騎。從橫蹂躪。在中日兩民族間。已造成無可彌縫之裂痕。而日閥復力排列强在華勢力。以圖鞏固日帝國主義之經濟基礎。更大量擴充軍實。務使滿洲爲其陸軍防禦之第一線。此爲遠東問題在軍事上。已難望和平之有成也。</p>
<p>日本旣利用其國内廉價之工資。復利用我國之低廉原料。加以對外匯兌跌落。日本製品。遂得在海外傾消之好機會。對我中國固如入無人之境。即對英帝國掩護下之各殖民地。如印度及東非等處。亦莫不受日製品傾消之影響。英國至是。不能不急謀應付。前此渥太華經濟會議以來尙未具體實現之經濟聯盟。至世界經濟會議失敗。而即亟亟加緊實施。自印度以至非洲各地。與夫英屬南洋羣島。皆提髙關稅。英日在太平洋西岸經濟競爭之劇烈。已甚明顯。此亦英日間不易和平之一證也。</p>
<p>日本自與英帝國發生意見而後。即感受市塲窄狹之痛苦。故又高倡親美之論。希圖在英日經濟鬭爭期中。使美國間接帮助日本。至少亦採取中立態度。然而美國對於日人之好意。仍默無表示。所可得而見者。竭全力以擴張海軍。預定於今後三年之間。建造三十二隻之新艦。計劃增加二億三千八百萬美金之預算。則美國之用意可知。日本至是乃亦提出第二次補充計劃。三年之内。建造新艦三十五艘。預算爲五億九千萬日金。並增海上航空機八隊。日美軍事競爭之烈如此。亦世界不易和平之一證也。</p>
<p>太平洋之形勢旣如上述。而矌觀當世各國。由執政者以至多數之人民。大都皆如痴如狂。從事於戰爭之準備。以戰爭爲解决當前矛盾之惟一手段。然則今日眞尙有和平之望乎。有和平之心。而無對等之實力則和平終成虚語。</p>
<p>願我國民鑒已往之故轍。察當前之情勢。勿再爲「和平」之虚名所誤。軍縮會十月重開美不願討論海比率</p>

<p>倫敦特約通信一志寄</p>
<p>六月二十九日（星期四）</p>
<p>今日爲安靜之一日、旣無驚人事件、亦無意外發生、但有不少之比賽、皆值得注意、甚至其中數組、有看守至傍晚八時將上燈者、陽光薄薄、温度適人、球塲滿是觀衆、外塲被圍住、甚至不能遠望之者、拾球童子、皆訓練不足、卽中央塲亦然、球每久持手中、而不知何投、或在比賽時任其滾滾於塲中者、一童子竟捉住在比賽時之一球、雖此球必將出界、</p>
<p>塞德與克拉姆佔住榮譽之中央塲、梵恩斯與三木在第一塲、如此開始、塞德以直落三得勝、第一盤得勝甚易、第二盤較難多多、第三盤有不少時間、爲其担憂、塞德擊球、富有判斷力、其網拍工夫、亦與其預定戰略相脗合、其前半塲與後半塲之擊法、異常平均、且十分準確、錯誤亦少、其發球亦較平日爲佳、恒隨卽前衝上網、大率成功、常被高球纏擾、但皆以有力或鋭角球壓殺之、克拉姆之球、大半自後塲來、抽擊甚佳、但錯誤造成者太多太多、幾乎全不上網、表示其能在底線守禦者、第一盤、其守禦嚴密、塞德破之綦難、第三盤爲塞德之試金石、克拉姆在五比三佔先時、曾有三次、須一記卽可勝盤、但爲塞德所破、成五比五、在八比七佔先時、克曾發一不可禦之重球、但被判作足誤、無論如何、塞德已足夠受用矣、</p>
<p>法瓜生旣勝潘萊、但在第一塲、以直落三敗於孟瑞爾、此捷克人擊球之硬與進攻之凶、與此南菲人一般、但較爲小心留意、球塲白線、爲其擊球之靶、雖有數次、僅僅擊出些些、其不出界者、大半無可回答、孟雖碩碩肥人、但富有危險性、必須繼續不息向其攻擊者、</p>
<p>奥斯汀與格蘭希爾、在中央塲比賽、奥之得勝、具有把握、爲應得勝利者、表演爽直無曲折、無一處不佳、其發球之佳、爲其網拍下從未得見者、惜每次擊球時、其右足皆一蕩過線、特别注意足誤之裁判員、竟如聾啞、奥步法及角球殊佳、無論退後抽擊、上網攔殺、高低壓球、皆同樣有力、</p>
<p>僅第二盤中、格蘭希爾曾奮勇劇戰、造成五比五、三次發球、被其擊破、使成平等、但自己發球、則又屬無效、以十比八完結第二盤、奥斯汀破格之發球、而又得其次、第三盤一面倒、格僅得一局、</p>
<p>此第二盤、戰鬥形勢平均、而爲中央塲上僅見之好球、在格蘭希爾回復本狀時、足可擊敗最佳或近乎最佳之奥斯汀、奥雖保持佔得之高勢、但常爲其難倒、因而疑惑不决、卒造成累累錯誤者、格蘭希爾有一線球、奥放任之、結果適爲一觸線好球、諸如此類、奥高舉兩手、證明其錯誤者、當其失一殺球、則不禁失聲而嘆、在危極之局面中、奥之表現、全不似爲英人、觀者並不注意及此、僅歡喜其表演之佳耳、</p>
<p>雄心勃勃之史蒂芬尼勝墨林甚易、而潑倫則在苦戰得勝一盤之後、掃除呑白爾、六比○、六比一、史本塞之勝克培、令人一驚、此二南菲人、五盤才分勝負、左手握拍之克培、曾二比一盤佔先、其得勝似無疑義、但忽一蹶不振、連失二盤、克培發球可怕、富攻擊性而峻急、史本塞擊來殊可、死不絲毫放鬆、</p>
<p>在中央塲上、佐藤布井表演美麗之球技、直落三擊敗曼爾與凱林、合作完美、其黏貼不弛、有可佩服者、曼爾與凱林、瑕疵互相、毫無進步、</p>

<h3 id="c185">召租文學 <a href="#c185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— 愼言</p>
<p>十　幾年前，我第一次到上海來的時候，首先引起我注意的便是各　　　個弄堂口和各根電桿木上所黏着的那許多紅色的小纸片。　愚知識簡單，總道是人家貼的福壽字或是喜神方之類，後來特地凑過去一瞧，原來是有空房子要出租的廣告，標題是「召租」兩字。「召租」本是一句簡短的成語，上海人却把它用作名詞，於是召租便成爲一件東西了。你如果問人家「召租的紙條子黏出没有」？人家就得笑你，因爲通常總是説：「召租黏出去没有」的。所以，我這裏所説的「召租」，也是一件東西，而不是一句成語了。</p>
<p>上海各處所黏的召租旣是這樣的多，而且一張揭了，第二張往往立卽起而代之，那末凡爲上海人，凡爲識字的上海人，當然都是善寫召租的了。我起初總是這樣想着。同時還覺得這些召租上的語句，如果用「熟能生」的一個定例推想，一定會很出色驚人的，因此，我就隨時留意着賞覽。結果却非常的失望。往往十張召租裏頭，他們的語句，如「水電俱全」「客堂公用」等等：：：竟有九張是相同的。而且末了，總得加上那麽一句狗屁不通的「非眷莫問」。</p>
<p>有一次，輪到我的朋友Ｘ博士寫召租了。不料他老人家提起筆來，也照例的寫了一大段刻板文章，最後，他又順勢寫了個「非」字：：：。到這時候，我可忍耐不往了，便立卽起而制止　　「難得你也寫起召租來了！我們不妨凑此談談召租文學」。我很興奮地向他提議着。</p>
<p>「好！那末就請你先發表意見吧」！</p>
<p>「我以爲别的暫時可以不論，惟有非眷莫問那一句話，非用革命的手段，把它立卽革除不可。因爲照字面上看起來，這句話祇有兩個解釋：</p>
<p>（一）不是跟屋主人有親眷關係的便不用問。</p>
<p>（二）並非正式眷屬的男女便不用問。</p>
<p>但是寫召租人的本意，却絶對不是上面這二點，而是「没有家眷的不租」，且也斷不根究你所帶的女人是否你的正式眷屬，祇要你不是光棍，便儘可問上一問了。這樣説起來，「非」宇當然没有存在的可能，應該換一個「無」字才行！」</p>
<p>Ｘ博士聽了，一面没口了應是，一面却從一大堆新聞紙裏頭，揀出了一張來。　　「先是改一個字，還不能算是「召租文學」的革命，你瞧這一段召租的標題，這才新頴活潑吧！」</p>
<p>我當眞接過報來一看，原來是「愛護幼童者注意」六個字，這倒眞是一個極醒目的標題。誰會想到他下面原是一篇法國公園附近有屋子出租的廣告呢？</p>
<p>我當塲便表示對於作者的搆思的奇巧，深爲佩服，還要求Ｘ博士讓我把這一段召租剪下來保存。從此，大家都知道我是特别的歡喜研究召租文學了。不久，就有一位住在法租界霞飛路呂班路口的朋友前來找我，要我替他代擬一張召租的底稿。我想了好半天，僥倖不曾繳白卷。題目是「卜居的先决問題」，中間除掉照例來幾句「房屋寛敞，光線充足」等刻版文章之外，又加了一句，「適在法租界各路電車交會之點」。朋友是十分滿意的去了。後來知道此召租一出，他的屋子便在當天的上午招到了主顧了。</p>

<p>（一）</p>
<p>有　一次等到電鈴響，妻即有意面向裏床裝已入睡，料他必定坐近床邊或許輕輕偷吻，及至吻着時，不防的把他頸項捉住，怪有趣的；但後來知道來的是同學，妻就鼓起小嘴，同學還當作什麽地方得罪伊了，後也始終未曾明白此中玄秘，經妻告訴後夫説：</p>
<p>『明天我向伊發表去，』</p>
<p>妻把鼻子一皺笑説：</p>
<p>『你敢』</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>妻常常關照夫：</p>
<p>『工作完畢，早些回來，你知道的，等人心焦呀！』</p>
<p>夫感覺很快樂，但晚上竟有意比常日還遲了些時回家，果然見妻十分不髙興，夫就懊悔，想想這没有意義極了，自已在外硬延時間的當兒，又同樣太覺寂寞；因之對妻小心地説：</p>
<p>『願受你的罰罷。』</p>
<p>妻伏在床上氣到動都不動，撩起伊的手臂看：原來妻在笑，於是如逢大赦的也笑了；但末了妻鄭重的説：</p>
<p>『下次不可！』</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>夫爲了幾件未了之事，不能實行與妻同到家鄉，火車開後，妻不時皺起眉心，連午飯都不吃，家鄉裏許多人問起他，妻覺得他們很尊敬伊的他，芳心中暗暗歡喜，祇一想到他不在身畔，又覺處處興趣毫無，怏怏不可終日！第二天，妻巳忍不住這寂寞，寫了一封信給他，寫的只有一句：</p>
<p>『青：我眞不高興！』</p>
<p>夫看了起先莫明所以，後來一想，把事幹完，立刻首途，及至見面，妻仍如寫信一般，很簡單説了一句：</p>
<p>『今天的晚上，我可以安睡了！』</p>
<p>夫微笑，得意地擁了妻將吻；但是他們母親的脚步聲，漸漸近來丨</p>
<h3 id="c187">輕重倒置 <a href="#c187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— 思素</p>
<p>魚　我所欲也，熊掌，亦我所欲也，　　　二者不可得兼，舍魚而取熊掌可也，天下事彷彿這一類的，眞多得很呢丨在九日浦東老白渡草泥塘大火中，又聽到這類不可得兼的事實，結果也是取了一個所欲，舍了一個所欲。但權衡輕重，却是和舍魚而取熊掌恰恰相反的，這就顯出一方是賢，一方是愚來了。</p>
<p>浦東老白渡草泥塘大火甫滅之時，我恰巧有事到浦東去，聽到許多關於大火的傳説，最悲慘的當然要算「燒死小孩達八九名之多」這一傳説了。那時並有人説明原因：被燒之家，都是操舟的，及在碼頭上挑抬的，日間男婦都不在家，所有小孩子，旣不能帶在身邊，留他們在家裏，又不能守户，只得將兩扇門鎖起來，把小孩子鎖在裏面：因而大火發作，被鎖着的孩子逃不出來，活活地燒死。還有一家，有個五歲的男孩，他的母親已經搶進屋裏抱在手上了；在這一瞥間，忽又想起床上有二十塊錢又急忙地抛了孩子，進去把錢取出來；因爲火勢愈猛，自己的意識裏只覺逃命要緊，竟忘了孩子；等到省悟，已經不及再進去救了！到明天，證實了燒死八九個的傳説是謡言，被燒死的只有一個，倒果然五歲，名張志龍。雖然不知道是否爲他的母親取二十塊錢而被害，但被災的都是些精窮人，家無隔宿糧的居多，而焚斃孩屍的頸項間，却圍有銀練一根，這與二十塊錢之説有點相近，如果這一取一舍根本不是謡言的話，則取舍者什九是張志龍的母親無疑了。</p>
<p>魚本來不如熊掌，没有熊掌纔會取魚，有了熊掌，即成爲珠玉在前，當然要舍魚而取熊掌，孟老夫子是個賢人，怎麽會取其次者呢。愚婦到底是愚婦，伊只知銀錢可寶，五歲的兒子都不及二十塊錢，把輕重倒置着。然而放眼一觀，輕重倒置的又豈止愚婦，儘有自命聰明的也竟始終執迷着輕重倒置呢！</p>

<p>棄職見知音佳人默許</p>
<p>承家得來者健兒狂歡</p>
<p>江　氏看到這種情形，分明是自己姑娘，完全答應了。照説　　　對於趙家這頭姻事，向來是自己贊成，姑娘挑眼。現在變了，變成了姑娘贊成，自己挑眼了，這不是一椿怪事嗎？那關耀武未成抽完的烟捲，還放在桌子上，江氏於是拿起一根，自已來抽着，不時的，將眼睛向姑娘看上一下。桂枝道：有什麽話要和我説，就説出來罷，幹嗎老是出神。江氏道：這頭姻事，你可是親口答應了的，以後可别再悔。桂枝板住了臉道：悔什麽？我把人心看透了。爺們都是把女人當着玩藝兒的，高興就要，不高興就不要。我只知道有丢了女人去找事的，可没有聽到丢了事來將就女人的。要瞧人心，就在這上頭瞧了。世界上無非是人心換人心，有這樣的事，我覺得是心滿意足了。江代靜靜有吸完了那枝烟捲，點點頭道：只要你有這種話我還有什麽話説，那就聽着你的意思去辦就是了。桂枝靜靜的坐在一邊，也就不曾説着别什麽。過了一會，聽着皮鞋聲由後面院子裏響着出去，彷彿是關連長走了。接着後院裏的趙翁，也就打開嗓子，在那裏唱戲了。桂枝是好幾天都没有聽到後院裏唱戲的聲音，這時候老太爺重復唱起來，這是表示着老太爺已經高興了。心裏這就想着，在趙家眼光裏，如何看得我起，這不像甘家那種做局長的人家，要把窮孩子給轟出來呢。這幾天，老太爺大槪也知道親事有點兒變卦，可是他見了面，依然笑嘻嘻的，這也不像那甘二爺，一翻臉就不認得人。他如此想着，便越是感覺到趙家父子的好處。（一六一）</p>

<p>氣　候這樣的熱，無論誰都是這麽嚷着，在　　　熱氛薰蒸中，龍弱的生命，很容易受着各種微菌仍襲擊，偶一不愼，便要得病，這是多麽危險的一件事啊！古人説：「病從口入」，眞是一些也不錯。所以我們在這個危險的季節，應當怎樣的愼於食物的選擇！這裡所説的，就是我所常吃的菜蔬，覺得很衛生的。</p>
<p>冰結雪鷄　小菜場上有一個灘子，是專門出售褪白的鷄，向他購小洋六角，就可一賞此味了，做法：先將白鷄用水洗凈，放入小罐内，加水少許，另用凍粉，（俗稱洋菜，產自日本，近來我們青島有很好的凍菜出世了，質料很好。）切細加入，煮至白鷄適於自己牙齒咀嚼的時候，撒以鹽花，澆以黄酒，再加味精等調味品。（切忌用醬油。）等到味道透入了白鷄，就把它盛起，凉了之後，放進冰箱。二小時後，預備一個大盆子，把白鷄拿出，倒覆在盆子裡，這味冰凉透鮮的雪鷄，就會在你舌尖上打戰了。</p>
<p>紅白交輝　上蔣雪腿的中腰峯，是一個腿子最好的部分，你把它外面的積垢清除了，取出了它紅得發鮮的好肉，用仔細的功夫把它切作細細的短條，（長約寸半）另外去買一塊鷄的胸子肉，煮熟，把它撕成細絲，最好也切得和火腿絲一樣長短，如其喜歡吃薑味的，還可以加一些細薑絲進去，火腿絲切好，放在碗内，上面用綿紙封好，在飯鍋上蒸熟，取出俟凉，和入薑絲，用精鹽味精黄酒互拌，用以佐酒，很覺鮮美可口，就是用來下飯，也自清爽宜人　　縐紗蹄胖　夏天吃肉，有一班朋友是不喜歡的，但是這樣吃法，其味至佳，法以鮮猪蹄洗凈在沸水中煮透，把它盛在篾籃中，晾乾水分，另用鐵鑊熬透生油或菜油，將猪蹄放入，儘量滾透，務使猪蹄的外皮，起蜂窠式，精肉也到差不多的程度，把它盛起，將油分瀝乾後，把它浸在冷水裏，俟猪蹄的外皮浸透了，再用洗凈的小白菜放在鍋内，入水少許，猪蹄拿來放在上面，再加鹽·酒·醬油，（如其喜歡香味的，還可加入茴香，桂皮之類。）把鍋蓋蓋緊，中途不可揭開，文火燉至一小時後起鍋，香氣之佳，得未曾有。至於味道的腴美，更是難以形容，打底的小白菜，也另有一種神味呢　　芥味鱔片　假如祇供二三人吃的，那麽祇須買四條粗壯一些的黄鱔就夠了，要吃這個東西，殘暴的表現是實在的，把鱔魚的頭釘在一方板上，用小刀在它的背脊上披開，（左手揑住它的尾尖）最好是單用它背上的肥肉，披好之後，用刀切成寸半長的片子，攤在竹籃内晾乾，另起油鍋，把它傾入煎透，加酒，精鹽，再加調好的芥厘粉，用剷刀攪匀，俟鍋内所有水分，都收入鱔片之後，把它盛起，那清香而雋永的滋味能把你舌根吊住。</p>
<p>辣粉排骨　肉舖裡買到現在切好的排骨，洗凈晾乾之後，把它浸在上好的白醬油裡，俟鹽味走入後，將鷄蛋白調入少許麵粉，排骨傾進攪匀，用生油或菜油煮沸，把排骨一方一方地放入滾透，把它盛起瀝乾油分，另用辣椒粉和蔴油調匀，排骨再放入鍋内，調成的辣椒粉傾進，急用鏟刀攪匀，卽行起鍋，在椒鹽，糖醋二味之外，使你嘗到另一種的風味。</p>
<p>翡翠頂子　這是一味平常而有味的小菜，用青壳鴨子四個，把它打碎在一個大碗裡，另用精肥相間的火腿，（卽一半紅色，一半白色的）切得一樣狹長的（長約寸半，闊約三分。）小塊，舖在碗的四周，紅的向外，白的向裡，再用一個鮮蓮蓬，把它每顆子尖的硬皮剥去，再在蛋的中央，碗上另覆一個碗，（以防水蒸氣侵入。）在飯鍋上蒸熟，取食時，自覺清香撲鼻，大有此菜祇應天上有之槪。</p>

<h3 id="c191">讓娘兒們幹一下吧！ <a href="#c191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— 林語堂</p>
<p>上星期見大陸報登一條新聞。有美國某夫人，是什麽女權大同盟的主席，名字似是Ｍlrs·Ｉnez　Ｈayne，已記不清了。她得着神感似的説：男子統治的世界，已弄成一團糟了。此後應讓女子來試一試統治世界，才有辦法。</p>
<p>以『統治世界』的男子之一的身分而言，我是完全贊成此議的。我原並不想要治天下。治了半世，也有點倦意了，我願意把天下禪讓出來，交給任何有勇氣接收這種責任的傻瓜。我要請假一下。我是道地失敗者。我想凡誠實的男子，都與我同意。就使達斯馬尼亞的土人願意出來肩此重任，我也願讓天下給他們。只怕他們有許由的聰明，不肯出來。</p>
<p>我要掛冠而去了。我覺得，而所有的男子大槪可同我覺得，「有子萬事足，無官一身輕」是可以欣羨的。據説，男子是自己蓮命的主人翁及世界的主人翁，而且是掌自己魂靈的主宰及掌一切人事的主宰；據説，世上最好的差事，如做文官，武將，市長，推事，導演，主筆，都被男子包辦了。老實説，誰在高興這些？事實是非常簡單。哥倫比亞大學某心理學敎授説過，眞正男女的分工，是男子賺錢·女人花錢。我很贊成調換一下。我很願意看見女子在船塢，會議室·編輯室·公事房出汗·而我們穿淡素旗袍在花園中，等我們所愛的人由公事房出來·帶我們去看電影。黑恩夫人·有此妙想，眞是可人。</p>
<p>這些自私的話且按下不提。老實説，我們看看自己的治績，也應該害臊。世事無論是中國是外國，是再不會比現在男子統治下的情形更壤了。所以姑娘們來向我們要求『讓我們娘兒們試一試吧』，我只好老實承認我們漢子的失敗，把世界的政權交給娘兒們去。</p>
<p>娘兒們專會生養兒女，而我們漢子徧要開戰，把最好的兒女殺死。這眞呌做短命。但是也没法可想。我們生性如此。漢子總是好戰。女人最多互相揪髮抓臉而已。假如傷口不入毒，實際上都没有什麽害處。女人最多拿帚柄相打，男子却非用機關槍對打不可。Ｈcy　wood　Ｂrown　説過，毛病就在我們喜歡聽鑼鼓或是現代的軍樂，我們一天喜歡聽鑼鼓，戰爭一天不會消滅，此可斷言。我們抵抗不過鑼鼓的聲音。假使女子統治世界，而將要宣戰，那時我們可以説：『姑娘們。現在的世界是你們的了。假使你們非打仗不可，你們自己去打吧』。這樣就没人用機關槍對打，而天下眞正太平了。</p>
<p>我們實在太不害臊了。軍縮會議失敗了。經濟會議也失敗了。人，男人，失敗了。誰也知道，現在的世界，應該大家禁用毒氣，和平貿易。但是我們怎麽做法？我們不把當今的賢者如羅素，愛斯坦，羅蘭之流請出來，却把這些事交給『專家』！我們要裁减軍備，促進和平，却去請出一班海陸軍事專家丨專長屠殺技術的嗜殺人的漢子丨來開會，而愕然詫異爲什麽軍縮會議失敗了。後來便是大家覺得戰債必須取消，關税必須廢除，世界的不景氣才會終止。我們怎麽辦呢？我們請出一些大學敎授，統計學家，眼光如豆、只懂得算百分之幾的關税『專家』，出來開會。於是又愕然詫異爲什麽經濟會議也失敗了。你想關税取消，這些關税專家，還有飯吃嗎？這等於請一些訓詁專家，來開會打倒漢字。</p>
<p>現在我什麽那不管了。外交家在掛白羊皮手套拉手談天，戰雲却瀰漫天際了，而我們正在，</p>
<p>自作聰明。如果不趕緊將世界治權由帶白手套的外交家及帶厚眼鏡的專家手裏奪回來，不久必有大戰，而一切就完了。所以也不必怎樣鰓鰓過慮。因此娘兒們要來自告奮勇，我只好説「來吧，姑娘們！上帝保佑你們！横竪你們治來的成績不會比我們現在更不像樣的。」</p>
<p>老實説，治天下並不很難，至少並不像『專家』們告訴我們那樣難的。假使你要禁止毒瓦斯，就禁止毒瓦斯。事情是做得到的，假使你有眞心，而假使你不請『專家』來開會。把所有的專家槍斃，而請蕭伯訥，愛斯坦，蘧利夫人出來統治世界，第二次大戰是可以而一定會避免的。</p>
<p>假使猴猻會知道我們人類在日内瓦所做的勾當，必定笑斷牙齒了。</p>
<p>至少我自己是預備下野，而把政權交與陶老三，富春樓老六，鄭毓秀，張默君之同性。假定我能積一點錢，我要跑到太平洋之南的島上，或是躦入非洲山林中。假使富春樓老六之輩，仍然不能消此浩刦，而歐洲文明全部焚滅了，那時我居在非洲深林的樹上，可以拍胸説：『上帝啊！至少我上誠實。』</p>
<h3 id="c192">我們怎樣敎育兒童的？ <a href="#c192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— 旅隼</p>
<p>看見了講到『孔乙己』，就想起中國一向怎樣敎育兒童來。</p>
<p>現在自然是各式各樣的敎科書，但村塾裏也還有『三字經』和『百家姓』。清朝末年，有些人讀的是『天子重英豪，文章敎爾曹，萬般皆下品，惟有讀書高』的『神童詩』，誇着『讀書人』的光榮；有些人讀的是『混沌初開，乾坤始奠，輕清者上浮而爲天，重濁者下凝而爲地』的『幼學瓊林』，敎着做古文的濫調。再上去我不知道了，但聽説，唐末宋初用過『太公家敎』，久已失傳，後來才從敦煌石窟中發現，而在漢朝，是讀『急就篇』之類的。</p>
<p>就是所謂「敎科書」，在近三十年中，眞不知變化了多少。忽而這麽説，忽而那麽説，今天是這樣的宗旨，明天又是那樣的主張，不加「敎育」則已，一加「敎育」，就從學校裏造成了許多矛盾衝突的人，而且因爲舊的社會關係，一面也還是「混沌初開，乾坤始奠」的老古董　　中國要作家，要「文豪」，但也要眞正的學究。倘有人作一部歷史，將中國歷來敎育兒童的方法，用書，作一個明確的記錄，給人明白我們的古人以至我們，是怎樣的被薰陶下來的，則其功德，當不在禹（雖然他也許不過是一條蟲）下。</p>
<p>「自由談」的投稿者，常有博古通今的人，我以爲對於這工作，是很有勝任者在的。不知亦有有意於此者乎？現在提出這問題，蓋亦知易行難，遂只得空口説白話，而望墾關於健者也。</p>
<h3 id="c193">孩子 <a href="#c193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— 周楞伽</p>
<p>孩子生了有八個足月了。</p>
<p>圓的臉，黑的眼珠，白胖的身體，瞧見人就笑，没有一個人不歡喜他。</p>
<p>老婆尤其愛得他什麽似的，整天抱着他在屋裏走。什麽事全忘掉了做。</p>
<p>可是我就恨着他。</p>
<p>這傢伙，自從他媽有了他以後，我就交上壤運：繭子跌到二十塊一擔，百斤穀不値兩塊錢，麥子什麽的全跌了價，背上拖了一身債。</p>
<p>「賣掉他。」我常常這麽想：「已經有了三個兒子了，還要他幹嗎？」</p>
<p>而且他又那麽會撒嬌，老哭着要奶吃。他越哭，我心裏越蹩扭，熬不住動手揍他。他哭得更響。老婆趕緊過來抱起他，衝我埋怨着：</p>
<p>「他又没犯着你，你没來由的揍他幹嗎？」</p>
<p>我也常常發狠地回她説：</p>
<p>『你瞧着，總有一天我得賣掉他。』　　今兒一早，我剛起牀，就聽得他哭。我恨極了，發瘋般跑到外面去。外面靜悄悄的，老婆去淘米了，只有三個兒子在屋裏玩。這正是個好機會，我慌不迭的抱起他衝門外跑。</p>
<p>一出門，就撞見了老婆。</p>
<p>『你抱他到那兒去？』她攔住了我問。　　『賣掉他，我不要他在我家裏。』</p>
<p>米羅從老婆手裏掉下，她闖上來搶奪。可是她的力氣没我大，我使勁推開她，就向前跑。</p>
<p>把一根草標插在孩子頭上，口裏嚷着：「賣孩子喲！」我在鎭上走了一整天。　　没有誰理我。天下起了雨。我的肚子餓着。我只有仍舊抱着孩子回家去。</p>
<p>一回家，就瞧見三個兒子在屋裏哭，米籮還在地下，老婆可不見了。</p>
<p>幾個鄰舍家的孩子告訴我許多不幸的消息：有些説她跳河死了，有些説她跑到山上去了，更有些説瞧見她在路上跑，一壁哭，一壁嚷着：「還我孩子來喲！」</p>
<p>我呆了一呆，心劇烈地痛楚着。我想到老婆的許多好處：怎樣跟我同甘共苦，怎樣帮我維持這一個家庭，怎樣照料這麽多的孩子：：：</p>
<p>『我總得把她找回來。』我對自家兒這麽説着，顧不得把手裏的孩子放下，重又跑出去。</p>
<p>外面下起了在雨，嘩啦嘩啦的。雨點打濕了我的衣服，身體；也打濕了孩子的衣服，身體。但我仍舊不顧一切的在雨裏跑，發狂地喊：</p>
<p>「阿大娘，你在那兒？你快回來喲！」　　没有一些應聲，只有雨點嘩啦嘩啦地響。</p>
<p>孩子也在我手裏哇哇的哭了。</p>

<p>— 姚克</p>
<p>人在病後，口中往往發生一種特殊的感覺。不論什麽美味的菜肴，心裡明知道這東西好喫，但一到嘴就覺得有些異樣丨丨乏味！</p>
<p>近來一二年中，我精神上常有一種特殊的感覺。這並不是那時髦的「青年病」煩悶丨因爲我並没有經濟的壓迫，也没有失感戀痛苦，而且我獨自一人在上海，當然也没有什麽家庭間對於工作毫不厭惡；在閒空的時候，我很會充分地享樂；在生活方面説來，我可算是一個愉快的青年。</p>
<p>平常時候，我所説的那「特殊的感覺」是下意識的，我並不覺得牠的存在。但是，牠時常會在不知不覺之中，像陰雲一般，在我意識中浮現出來。牠不一定伺着我的孤寂或無聊；往往在興高采烈的時候，百忙中我也會覺得似乎觸了電，而一刹那間，眼前興高采烈的娛樂都變爲「乏味」。</p>
<p>病後的人，因爲口中乏味，往往喜歡喫些醬瓜，鹹蘿蔔之類，換換口味。我也想換換口味丨丨上海實在是太油膩了！</p>
<p>滿天的星，滬寗車追着夏夜的凉風，向西去。十分鐘後，這「油膩的都市」的風景線已在烏沉沉的夜色中漸漸消失了。</p>

<p>— 孫泱</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>一艘土紅色的輪船靠着太古碼頭停着，一股黑烟從烟囱裏冒出來，筆直地竪在没有風的空氣裡；烟灰却四散地落下，撒在江心，撒在擁擠在碼頭上的苦力們的頭上。</p>
<p>苦力們大半是赤膊的，肩上搭着灰黑的布；補着各式各樣補　的褲子，被發霉的皮帶，發黑的布帶，油污的麻繩或簇新的草繩束在腰上。他們不整齊地站做兩行，魚貫地從一個鋼鐵的小門裡鑽進大輪船的肚子。站在後面的躡着脚，焦急地望着前面，露出恨不得立刻就走上去的神氣。但當他們從艙裏頭出來，肩上馱着超過自己的重量的包裹時，才記起疲勞已經傷害了他們的每一個細胞：伶仃黑瘦的脚劃着不等距離的折線，它們早已連那黑瘦的身軀都支持不住了。蓬亂的頭髮下，黄豆大的汗珠在額上滾着。乾癟的嘴有時猛地張開，「咳丨」一口含着無數肺癆菌的痰便落在地板上。</p>
<p>六月江邊的低氣壓，侵入了陰沉的貨艙。艙裡，炭酸氣，汗臭氣，飛揚着的塵埃，混合着混亂的吮唷聲，鑽進苦力們的鼻孔，喉曨和耳朶。然而臭味，噪雜和遥遠的家一般地統統給扔在腦後了。他們唯一的希望，便是包裹從由底艙上來的人的肩膊上被兩個大漢接過來後，輕一點轉擲在他們的肩膀上。</p>
<p>底艙裡閃着通黄的電燈光，和從階梯出口處漏進來的灰白的光混着，微微地泛出陰慘的氣味。大的包裹被鐵條綑着，一層層地堆在底板上。幾十個機械一般的動物，忘掉了歡樂和幸褔，在疲勞裡有次序地勞動，像同一根發條鼓動着的輪盤：四隻手拾起一個大包裹，往另外的一個赤着的肩膊上一放，便回轉去抬第二個包裹；另外的兩隻脚就拖起沉重的脚步，在自己的吮唷聲中靠左走上那條階梯，在出口處把重載交給那兩個大漢，就在别人的吮唷聲中靠右走下來。這一付機器自動地轉着，永遠不停息，貨物便大便似地從出口處流出。如果機械的某一部份因疲勞而發生了障礙，那末，一個穿黑香雲紗衫的人手中的竹鞭，就代替了滑機油，雨點似地落在那一部份機械上；於是，滑脱了齒輪的輪盤，又重新走上正軌。</p>
<p>一個黑瘦的身軀掮着包裹，蹣跚地往階梯上爬，胸部因喘息而起伏着。黑瘦污穢的肉深陷下去，肋骨便像人體博物院的模型似地露出來。幽暗的光隨着胸部的動作，在那上面劃出黑影的線條。油膩的褲子剛掩住膝蓋，兩條小腿像冬天天的樹枝般露出外面；每一舉步，那對膝蓋就中風似地摇晃着。</p>
<p>「快點！死屍！没有勁就别吃這碗飯！」從香雲紗衫頂上吐出這樣的咆哮，那條竹鞭在空氣裡呼呼地舞動，像一條尋人而嚙的毒蛇。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c220">怎樣救濟靑年的心理病態 <a href="#c220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— 溥</p>
<p>閲本刋見爾礎君的「靑年心理之大敵」，不覺有動乎中，本來，關於這個問題，藴釀我心中已久，早想説説，奈以事情重大，不敢枉加討論。現在人家旣談之於先，並且希望引起共鳴，所以我也來「附驥尾」的説幾句，些微貢獻一點鄙見。</p>
<p>查靑年們之所以有心理的病態，當然是自身没有堅定的意志，或者没有主確的理智而使然。但是其他家庭，學校，社會各方面，也不能負責任，因爲環境的良惡，敎育的完缺，職業的正邪，都和靑們的心理人莫大關係。現在，怎樣救濟靑年的心理病態？自然，單純的説靑年們應該何自拔·如何自救，恐怕難收實效。至少，須少，須聯合家庭，學校，社會各方面，分工合作，以冀得到萬一的效果。</p>
<p>（一）靑年自身方面：</p>
<p>甲　明瞭做「人」的責任，確定自己的「人生觀」。</p>
<p>乙　整理自己的思想，養成遲輯的頭腦。</p>
<p>丙　鍜鍊自己的意志，努力所進取的目標。</p>
<p>丁　抱定堅苦卓越的精神，應付横逆的環境。</p>
<p>戊　制裁不正當的慾望，認定「人格」和「學問」是改造一切之利器。　　己　反抗一切因襲的勢力，建立自我的生活。</p>
<p>庚　發展互助的精神，去團結扶助其他的靑年。</p>
<p>（二）家庭方面：</p>
<p>甲　對靑年的生活，應加以適當的指導。</p>
<p>乙　給靑年以婚姻的自由權。</p>
<p>丙　承認靑年在家庭間有相當的地位。</p>
<p>丁　鼓勸靑年養成獨立的能力。</p>
<p>（三）學校方面：</p>
<p>甲　提倡職業敎育，使不能深造的靑年有謀生的技能。　　乙　實施民衆敎育，使失學靑年有獲得知識的機會。　　丙　注重性敎育，使靑年不致誤入歧途。</p>
<p>丁　指導靑年各種修養的方法。</p>
<p>戊　設法改良靑年惡劣的環境。</p>
<p>（四）社會方面：</p>
<p>甲　發展生産事業，以容納職業過剩的靑年。</p>
<p>乙　改革私有財産制，使靑年的環境逐漸平等。</p>
<p>丙　革除宗敎，風俗上一切束縛靑年思想的因襲勢力。　　丁　組織正當娛樂的塲所，使靑年有適宜的消遣。</p>
<p>戊　設立靑年儲蓄銀行，以養成靑年儲蓄的習慣。</p>
<p>己　設立靑年失業分紹所，以免靑年漂泊墮落。</p>
<p>庚　發行靑年刋物，負指導與帮助的責任。</p>
<p>辛　舉行關於道德學術之公演講，以期時時喚醒靑年。</p>
<p>親愛的靑年丨靑年問題實關係社會整個的問題，在下很抱愧地自問對於社會的實際方面，並没有下過精細的觀察，現在爲了篇幅關係，將救濟的方針很簡率的寫出來，難免有許多隔靴搔癢的地方，尚請高明者不吝加以討論。</p>
<h3 id="c221">傍晚時候的把戲 <a href="#c221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— 瘏馬</p>
<p>記得有兩句舊詩，「夕陽無限好只是近黄昏」，一句是寫夕陽的景色美麗，一句是感慨夕陽之後便就要天昏地黑了。但是在天氣炎熱的時候，尤其是在上海，屋小人多，終日被炎威壓迫，好像悶在蒸籠裏，没有錢，没有福分去避暑，祇有希望暴烈的太陽，早些兒没落丨還有甚麽興趣去看夕陽的景緻。并且希望下一陣雨，發幾陣風，使得大家透一透滿肚皮的熱氣，還有甚麽心緒去管黑暗與光明呢丨</p>
<p>人生的基礎，是築在金錢之上的，這是大家不能否認的事實。江湖賣藝者，當然逃不出這個例子，靠着幾套「騙人的把戲」找幾個錢來維持他的衣食，以及「狗與猢猻」的生命，趁着天色未晚，凉風微動的當兒，牽了狗和猢猻，背負木箱，老實不客氣，掛上幾個「假面具」，向街頭巷口跑，發展他的生財之道。</p>
<p>這時路邊牆隅，就有許多人坐着立着，雖説暑氣未消，這許多人已經是準備消受天然付給伊們應該消受的凉爽。假使左右附近有塊面積較大的空塲，那末就當他是「勞動者的牯嶺」，「窮人的靑島，莫干山，」無論男女老幼，一視同仁，到空塲上去休息納凉，一直要到深夜才散。</p>
<p>小鑼之聲朗朗地響着，自然會有許多人凑熱閙，聚攏來成一個圓圈，把兩個賣藝者，一隻狗，一隻猢猻，圍在中間，看牠做把戲。</p>
<p>狗與猢猻開始工作了，「狗繞圈而走」，猢猻身上本來已經穿一件紅布衫，可惜没有穿袴子，這時賣藝者號令一聲，狗越發走得快，「猢猻也戴起假面具」，頂上「破紗帽」，神氣活現地扮演幾套俗語所説「衣冠禽獸」的老把戲，祇引得一般無知無識的小孩子快活到手舞足蹈。</p>
<p>天色漸漸的暗了，賣藝者的袋裏增加着不少銅元，便興冲冲牽了狗與猢猻去了。只聽得納凉人説：那狗與猢狲，也是爲了「食的問題」，方才肯聽賣藝者的號令，要敎猢猻做把戲，必須先要「殺鷄給猢猻看」，猢猻怕死，就學會了，不過學的，做的是什麽戲，狗與猢猻一切都不明白，「任人搬弄而已」。</p>
<h3 id="c222">這是什麽道理？ <a href="#c222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— 士本</p>
<p>蚊虫嗡嗡嗡振起了翅膀結着團體開始做牠的侵略工作的一個大熱天的晚上，臥房裏實在給牠們搗亂得住不下了，没法祇得姑且效學張少帥的不抵抗主義而退出了這整個臥室的地盤丨逃往大門外街上去納凉，暫避其鋒丨</p>
<p>到了外面，街上電炬亮得光芒似畫。這般凶猛殘酷的赤匪（蚊·滿腹紅色恐怖），倒也不敢再打着夥兒來明目張膽地大舉的向我進攻了，只有偷偷地化整爲零的來你背後竊取一些維牠命。</p>
<p>怎麽丨怎麽丨你看這般人爲何都在急急地往西奔，有的臉上還帶着緊張的情緒。不要是誰家失火了，但又不聽見衆人嘴裏呌着救火。究是什麽一回事？跑去一看便知，笨伯丨還要想牠則甚。於是站起身來，無目的地跟着衆人前進。走出了十來個門面，方在他們的議論裏探知是本鎭公安局裏剛才在東街捉到四個烟犯，即劉就要審問，衆人去看審事的。捉鴉片平凡的事，有什麽好看，但在這十八世紀的鄉鎭上。少見多怪丨</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>晚飯後没有影戲院世界可供消遣，跑去看看審烟犯，也未始不可消遣，這倒要原諒他們的咧。</p>
<p>「你是賣烟的麽？」「老爺小人不敢賣丨」「混賬丨現有烟槍四支，鴉片一缸，證據確鑿，你還敢抵賴？」「是丨」。「你們三人爲什麽吸鴉片丨」（「老爺丨小人們不敢吸丨」「現在人贓並獲，還敢狡辯丨」「是丨是丨是丨」我夾在人堆裏聽見裏邊在這樣問答着。同時探首向裏邊一望，見桌上擺列着四副殺人不見血的槍砲（烟燈）和一個染滿黑色的磁缸，想來裏面就是　的萬惡的鴉片。審烟犯倒迅速啊　你看四個人只有三言兩語，已全部承認了。</p>
<p>「這四個癮君子，人證並獲，口供確鑿，那麽公安局照律至多覊押二十四小時，無疑地明天就要移送法院去的。恐怕結果每人至少要吃Ｘ等有期徒刑一年以下三月以上的官司，那燕子窠窠長，看來還要加等受罪。這樣看來，一個人總要安份，莫作犯法事情，須知俗語説的「王子犯法，庶民同罪」法律的威嚴神聖，是任何人没法假借的啊丨」一個人在歸途上這樣地自思自想。</p>
<p>一到明天，上得街去，奇啊丨怎麽昨天夜裏公安局捉的四名烟犯都己開釋了。仍在街上來來往往，没有去吃官司呢？我昨夜在歸途上心裏所猜測的他們受法律裁判的一種限度，覺事實和理想絶對的相反了。難道法律已失却牠的威權和效能嗎？不然爲甚麽這四個人贓並獲供詞確鑿的烟犯，會不受法律的裁　而已恢復自由了。眞正奇怪吧丨</p>

<p>老婦：日本兵在飛機上撒下許多字條子，也説是如何如何好。大家都説自己好，到底不知道相信那一邊才對。</p>
<p>中年：不管怎樣，説得好總是没有用的。無論什麽軍隊，只要眞的能夠拚命打東洋，就是好的。不要他們敎我們擁護，也自然會擁護的。爺爺！（指老者）你説對麽？只要不敎我們做亡國奴，我們什麽都願意幹。　　老者：可不是嗎？民國以來，年年兵慌馬亂，我們多少災難都受盡了，現在假如眞的肯打外國人，就是再受一次苦又有什麽不可以呢？</p>
<p>中年丙：假如説我們還不是爲國家出力，那眞是天老爺没有眼睛。譬如説昨天我不在家，我家裏的一隻驢子和一匹騾子都給兵大爺運東西去了。假如我在家，我當然得跟着去的。現在誰知道那裏去了呢？可是我一家人全靠着這兩隻牲口活命的啊。今天我在一帶守了一下午，假如回來了，想把牠領回去。可是一直到現在都不見來，眞把人急死了哩。</p>

<p>吸收蘭心大戲院内外裝修</p>
<p>美國片的獨覇中國市塲，無疑地引起德片强烈的抗爭，在中國每一個大城市中都見到德片的侵入與活躍。同時英國片也不甘落後的緊追，先後紹介了若干的「不列顚風」的歌舞音樂片，像「戰地歌舞會」「歡喜綠」「錦瑟珠喉」等。但，英國片的背後没有相當的出路，而仰給於戲院是得不到如意的發展的。所以他們施展手腕，把盤踞在邁而西愛路一角的蘭心大戲院承租下來，形成了第一道自衛戰綫。</p>
<p>英國片的代理商是英國影片公司。他們巳與本國製片家有相當的默契。幾家有名的影片公司，都簽訂了長期合同，源源供給他們認爲合於中國觀衆口味的影片。不但如此，還派了一個正式代表，長川駐在倫敦，負責進行這件事。據説，這兩年來，英國影業的開展，確有長足的進步，無論是技術或表演上。他們先提高品質，繼着是充實娛樂成分，要造成毎一個影片都有相當娛樂的涵義。過去的在本埠已公映的幾部片，就是這準則下的初期産物。當然，他們希冀着有更超特的作品，而勝過好萊塢所貢獻的一切。</p>
<p>誠然，音樂喜劇化的英國片在國内外市塲上，都巳獲得偉大的成功，所以，製片商更堅决地提出「娛樂」爲口號，加增這種音樂片的産量。不久就要在本埠公映的，有「彩鳳求凰」“Ｍarry　me”，是「歡喜緣主角」麗諾茂娜主演的一部輕快喜劇。還有「歡喜緣」裏的扮老僕歐的賈克許爾勃主演的“Ｊack’s　the　Ｂoy”和“Ｈove　on　Ｗheels”兩部片。他的新頴諧趣的表演是最値得人們憶戀的。亞歷山大高達是製作笑片的數一數二專家，他特地挑選兩位難畫難描的冷雋滑稽家羅萊楊和喬治葛洛史密斯來主演“Ｗedding　Ｒehearsal”，有甚新的特殊貢獻。‘Ｒome　Ｅxpress”「羅馬快車暫譯」是一部全明星的偉大作品，跟好萊塢的「大飯店」有同樣的意義，這是値得我們加以甚深的注意丨</p>
<p>爲了這些新片的來臨，對於它們初眏的電影宮丨丨蘭心大戲院也特别下了一番内外的修整。座位完全重新改造過，聲機方面，是採用西電公司最新式的一種。這種機械就能避免一切的回音，同時能擴大最低的音而同時能匀低最高的音。他們唯一的目標，是要使勞役的人們踏進這電影宮，感受着心靈上的啓示而獲得莫名的快慰。</p>

<p>東方巨港將上銀幕</p>
<p>徐欣夫自從「血債」完成之後，久未工作，最近拿到了一本以鹽塲爲背景的脚本「鹽潮」，「温呑水」立刻昇至沸點，動手工作。前日率領胡蝶·王獻齊·孫敏·顧梅君等一隊，嬉笑顔開的上澉浦去攝外景。不料晚上接到一封自該地鹽塲來的快信，説近日狂風怒濤，海邊上之蘆棚小舍，均被吹坍云云，於是公司中人都以爲他們要乘興而去，敗興面回了，但昨天公司的兩輛車子回來説他們一到澉浦，狂風止，怒濤息。於是徐欣夫好比「刦後餘生」一般，欣欣然的開始工作了。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c227">評「紅粉刦」Ｐiclk　Ｕp <a href="#c227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>一般的説，美國影片差不多總是在一個定型之下攝製出來的，這一點，我們在這「紅粉刦」中又可得着證明。</p>
<p>少婦曼麗因乃夫不良而被牽累入獄。刑滿先丈夫出獄，生活無法維持，幸遇一靑年汽車夫，並由他的介紹而至汽車行任電話接線生。其後，汽車无因得女之規勸而力圖上進，竟自爲小汽車行之主人。生活裕如，殊非昔比。汽車夫欲與女結婚，而女竟因有所屬而不允。不久，他竟日無一浪漫女人相周旋，女覩此情狀，乃决然請求律師與乃夫離婚。汽車夫轉向其浪漫女求婚，可是又遭拒絶。就在這個時候，女之丈夫自獄中出，以殺汽車夫相要脅，而逼女隨之偕去。卒以女施巧計報告警察而將其已離婚之丈夫捕去，經汽車夫之極力援救而得與有情人偕老。</p>
<p>在這一故事中，我們很容易發見不少與其他影片相同之點。爲了要寫一個忠於愛情的女人，必定要寫對方（男人）對於愛情的不專，見異思遷，或者是被妖惑於另一女人，於是在這裏必須要有一個蕩婦出現。要寫一個貞節婦人變節，必定是她所遇非人，逼於不得已而改嫁，於是在這裏就必須要有惡徒大盜出現。最後，再説明，男女間的眞愛，必定要在艱難困苦中得來，所以經過幾度的波折，多情男女，在受着法律的保障之下而和合以終。丨這是一個銀幕上的公式，在美國片中最爲適用。中國的影天一公司有聲新片「生機」邵醉翁導演陳玉梅主演。</p>
<p>片製作家，爲了「學習前人的技巧」，便盡可能的採取了這一公式。這一公式在中國反映出了不少作品，大槪是用不着舉例證明的吧。</p>
<p>有人説，美國片始終祗能在羅曼斯中兜圈子，這固然是事實的證明，不過羅曼斯的範圍也不見得就如此之小，難道就不能翻出一些新花樣來嗎？所以他們一方面是感着極度的題材缺乏，（其實假使作家的生活豐富，决不會有如此感覺）。另一方面，要一次又一次的虚構故事，也不免感覺無能爲力了。</p>
<p>因了這一故事的陳腐無味，所以姑無論導演是怎樣賣力，終於不能使這一影片有着存在的價値。導演的能力，充其量是他能夠使演出相當有趣，成績是在對白中引人發笑。然而演出之單調也是因着故事而無可避免的，在前半部我們只看着男女主角在銀幕上走去，雖是對白可笑，亦不能提起觀衆的興趣。到後來雖然相當緊張，但因分幕的零碎，終於不能組織觀衆的情感。也許説有些小地方較爲可取，如女主人翁自離婚歸來，懹着極度的快樂，而不能得情人之歡心，浪漫女人歡樂的塲面，以及女主人翁巧計報警等，可是究竟不能因此而獲得其特殊價値。</p>
<p>雪爾維亞薛耐因演「蝴蝶夫人」而獲得國人不少讚譽，但是和導演同樣在這一影片中不能把握過去的成績，固然這「紅粉刦」和「蝴蝶夫人」的情調截然不同，而她所飾的劇中人之個性却仍然是没有多少差别。可見演員們並不是在同一的範圍之内都能成功。</p>
<p>附帶的説一句，這一作品在日本亦未得好評。片名被改譯爲「舖道」，固然不像中國的譯名能有誘惑性，但不知直譯爲「選擇」是否得當？</p>
<h3 id="c228">關於電影大衆化 <a href="#c228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— 人英</p>
<p>電影大衆化，在這個年頭兒眞是喊得震天價響；而同時電影大衆化也被一般人所誤解了。而電影所以要大衆化的出發點，大約有二個原因（一）賴電影來敎育大衆，補充大衆敎育的不足。（二）把時代下痛苦的呻吟，搬到銀幕上；使人們知道現在是怎樣的一個時代。這像文藝在衆化一樣，使都市的太太小姐們於看了甜情蜜意的愛情片以後，灌輸一些痛苦大衆的影像；或者掉換他們或她們的口味。</p>
<p>關於電影大衆化，在從前也曾經有許多人發表過這方面的理論。其實電影大衆化，並不在乎全國影界一致總動員，專門用大衆的題材來描寫大衆的電影。否則事實上是不能夠辦到的，而且這種工作也無須這樣做。大衆化的電影，祗要能夠感動人；這比較文字爲更有力。總括的説，大衆化的電影，是要用時代的意識，呐喊出在衆的呻吟。或者敎育大衆，給他們以一個新的啓示。</p>
<p>我記得某電影刋物，對於電影大衆化；曾發表過像喬其伯納蕭樣幽默的諷刺。牠説：『假使電影大衆化是適合於現在的話，我們可以呌馬路上的癟三去做演員。而編成『黄包車夫戀愛史』『草棚艷史』等等的劇本：：：』（因原文無從覓得，記其大槪如上。）我認爲這些不但是某電影刋物無理由的諷刺，丨或者可認爲誤解，這還是現在一般對於電影大衆化普遍的誤解。我們固然希望電影大衆化，能收他日敎育大衆的効果；不是把大衆的生活也變成頽靡。這方面而搬到銀幕上來。希望研究電影大衆化的朋友，有一個有力的反響。</p>

<p>— 馬瞻</p>
<p>薛立丹和意士頓二人正在爭持不决的當兒，他們聽見對面臥房的門開了。伊繁露闌絲嘴裡還是哼着「羅苗和仇理愛」劇中的歌詞，很快活地走出來了。薛立丹連忙追出去，但是他見了她，没有得機會將信封裡的錢交給她。她儘着説那迷戀於意士頓的話，她説她没有功夫，她要獨自一個人去計劃她和意士頓將來的合作。她説並不是因爲意士頓現在在戲院方面的地位高，實在她想帮助他，因爲她覺得意士頓的人太好了。她説完了就伸出手來和薛立丹説再會，她就走了。薛立丹痴站了半响，亦就走了，他暫時亦不願意回來見意士頓。</p>
<p>如同做一個快活的夢，生了翅膀飛到雲天最高之處；但夢醒幻滅的時候，所感到的就係胸中的刺痛。翅膀亦折傷了，在澈骨寒風之上打着，可憐終究必須下墜，起初伊繁很堅强的不信會失望，但長時期的飢寒交迫，使她不能不接受運命之説。但她還能努力向前走着，頭抬得高高的，眼睛向着上，忍着心上新創痕割裂的痛苦，還想追趕那一線將逝的希望。在意士頓呢，這一段事情亦都隨着伊繁的消逝置諸腦後了。凡不是穿心過的事情，都是這樣一過就忘記的。日月過得很快，「靑天」的排演日期將滿，而「金枝」又正在試排之中了。麗姐華儂趾高氣揚着睥睨一切。她一般脅肩詔笑的朋友，天天恭維着她，對她説「靑天」一劇的能得到這樣的成功，完全由於她色藝超羣的緣故，她應當拿雙倍的薪水以及盈餘紅利的一部份。她聽了這種話，深信不疑，靜待着機會的來到。她知道薛立丹的反對她作「金枝」的主角，但是，</p>
<p>强迫着意士頓一定要將主角的地位給了她。薛立丹明知麗妲不明劇情，恐怕不容易瞞過觀衆，但是麗妲的絶對自信，使他無法可施。麗姐的突然的暴發，使她蔑棄一切比較的標準，以爲她是當代惟一的大坤角。她現在看見千載一時的機會到了。她胸中計劃已定，祇等那「金枝」開塲的第一夜，她就可以向意士頓提出她的條件，强迫意士頓承認，使他措手不及，祇好無條件屈伏。當她這樣安排的時候，她亦没有想到薛立丹已經有了防備。當「金枝」試排的過程中，薛立丹在一旁默默地看着。他的指撥，完全被麗姐當作耳邊風。她的身份，完全和劇中人的身份不合的。薛立丹於痛惜劇情不得忠實開展之餘，頗思能覓得一適當的主角，將「金枝」重排一下。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Water Head Over Ten Feet Enters Dasha River Through Gaozhai <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Zhenjiang) The Provincial Government received a telegram from Fengxian, stating that the Yellow River reached Gaozhai on the 17th, with the water head being one li wide and five chi deep. The water behind was five li wide and over ten feet deep. Because the old Yellow River is over ten feet higher than the Dasha River, the speed has increased by over ten li per hour, making it impossible to block. It has now entered the county's Dasha River and has a tendency to enter Zhaoyang Lake in Peixian. Another telegram from Xiaoxian on the 17th stated that the water entered the county along the old course last night, five to six feet high and about two Chinese li wide, endangering the residents along the coast. Another telegram from Peixian on the 17th stated that the county magistrate supervised the work and went to Fengxian to assist in the blocking. Although the county has not been affected by the disaster, it has fully prepared for defense. Another telegram from Dangshan on the 16th stated that the water reached Guozhuang north of the city at noon on the 16th, flowing horizontally at about two chi. The accumulated water in Xidazhai is seven chi, and deeper to the west. The depth within the territory has not reached ten feet. It is estimated that the Yellow River water will all enter the canal in two or three days. The Provincial Government telegraphed the Canal Works Bureau on the 17th to set up defenses in the central canal first. The Canal Bureau ordered Xia Xianglu of the Huaipi section to go to Supi to cooperate with the counties in conscripting laborers to prevent and block, and planned to block the villages of Linjiaba and Weishan Lake. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) On the 17th, all the villagers in the various towns in the first district of Xubu were mobilized to form dike protection and emergency repair teams, enthusiastically repairing the dikes. All the breaches will be repaired within days. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Wang Shicai, the Director of the Public Security Bureau, returned to Xu from Huangkou on the evening of the 17th after surveying the water. According to him, the eastward flow of the Yellow River reached Gaozhai, north of Huangkou, and was blocked by the dam, entering the Dasha River flow. He personally went to Gaozhai to inspect and found that the water head was over ten feet high. It could not flow eastward unless the dam broke. The laborers of Xiao and Dang will rush to block the breach there. Most of the water has turned into Fengpei. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Peixian telegraphed on the evening of the 17th that the Yellow River flood flowed into the Dasha River, reaching Loulou, 25 li from the city, five to six feet high and two li wide, flowing towards Zhaoyang Lake. Peicheng is rushing to block it, and the urban area is suddenly in critical condition. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) The old Yellow River dike around Xuzhou, starting from Woniu Mountain in the west, surrounds the northwest and east sides of Xuzhou city to Jizui Dam, about sixteen li long. There are as many as dozens of breaches, especially the seven between Duanzhuang and Xiaobeimen, which are the most dangerous. Two battalions of the 88th Division are responsible for the three eastern breaches, and the 39th Regiment and the Independent Battalion of the 7th Division are responsible for three breaches, and six to seven hundred farmers from Duanzhuang and Dengbazhuang are assisting in the construction. The cooperation between the army and the people is excellent. Many soldiers wear willow-woven hats. Although they are sweating under the scorching sun, they are still very excited. The breach from behind the electric light factory to Jizui Dam is the responsibility of the civilians. The breach project and the flood control dam are as high as the two ends and as thick as two zhang. If the Yellow River water flows into the old course and is within the height of one zhang and five chi, Xuzhou city will be safe. If it is as high as two zhang, Xuzhou will be flooded. Now all the sackcloth and cattail mats in the whole port have been requisitioned. The county government also ordered the Baojia to sound the gongs in the city, ordering each household to send a laborer to concentrate on the dike. (17th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) The Yellow River water is flooding eastward. At 12:00 p.m. on the 16th, Dangshan County Magistrate Ren Naigeng reported to Commissioner She that the water reached Dali Village, 40 li east of Dang, and entered Xu along the old course. The water head was eight to nine feet high. At 8:00 a.m. on the 17th, according to a telephone report from the Longhai Railway, the water passed Dali Village and reached Panlongji, east of Huangkou. Also, Fengxian telegraphed at 9:00 a.m. on the 17th that the water head had reached Gaozhai, with waves of one zhang and two chi high and about five li wide, rushing eastward. Because the water surface was too wide, in addition to entering Xu through the old course, a stream flowed into the Dasha River, flooding towards Zhaoyang Lake in Peixian, and the situation entered the Grand Canal. County Magistrate Hu of Peixian telegraphed Commissioner Yu on the morning of the 17th, saying that he had sent 7,000 civilians to Fengxian to assist in the blocking, and the situation in Peixian was critical. (17th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) According to a road dispatch on the evening of the 17th, the Yellow River water came east along the old course, passed through Panlongji and entered the Dasha River, backflowing into Zhaoyang and Weishan Lakes. Feng and Pei are in a tight spot. The water in the old course is still invading eastward, gradually entering Tong territory, but the force is slightly reduced and the water势 is slightly weakened. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) According to a road dispatch, the Yellow River water in western Shandong is pouring into Weihu Lake, and the water from Weihu Lake is pouring into the Grand Canal, causing the water level to rise at Pao Chezhen on the Longhai East Road. The counties of Pi, Sui, and Su will be affected. Fengxian telegraphed on the evening of the 17th that the Yellow River water had reached Huashan, 20 li east of Feng, making Fengcheng dangerous. Peixian will also be affected. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) At midnight on the 16th, Dangshan County Magistrate Ren Naigeng reported to Commissioner She Nianci that the Yellow River water had traveled to Dali Village, 40 li east of Dangshan. The water was three chi at its shallowest and [] chi at its deepest. At 8:00 a.m. on the 17th, according to telephone reports from stations along the Longhai Railway, the water had passed Dali Village and reached Panlongji, north of Huangkou, less than 100 li from Xubu. Also, Fengxian telegraphed at 9:00 a.m. on the 17th that the water head had reached Gaozhai, with waves over ten feet high. A part of the water flooded into the Dasha River, invading Peixian, and the water in Peixian had a tendency to turn towards Zhaoyang and Weishan Lakes. (17th Dispatch) (Xuzhou) After the Xubu ring city dike was rushed to repair by the garrison yesterday, the county government collected civilians this morning to participate in the repair of the Jizuiba section in the south of the city. All the cattail and linen bags in the whole port were bought up. The reporter inspected along the dike and found that the soldiers and civilians were very excited. The soldiers mostly wore willow branch hats and worked hard under the scorching sun. It was found that the ring city dike, from Woniu Mountain to Jizuiba, was about 15 li long, with more than ten breaches, all of which were being rushed to repair. She Nianci sent Wang Shicai, Director of the Public Security Bureau, to Dangshan on the morning of the 17th to inspect the water situation, and ordered the Technical Office to pre-set water markers for measuring the water, and ordered the first district office to supervise the township chiefs and lead the civilians to repair the breached dikes within three days. (17th Dispatch) (Xuzhou) Fengxian telegraphed at noon on the 17th that the Yellow River water entered the Dasha River from the old river course. Because the Dasha River course was more than ten feet lower than the old river course, the water was extremely rapid, surging and rushing towards Zhaoyang Lake. Fengbian territory is in danger. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Wang Gongjian, the County Magistrate of Xiao, telegraphed on the morning of the 17th that the Yellow River water had entered the Xiao territory along the old river course yesterday. The water was five to six feet high and about two Chinese li wide, and the residents along the coast were quite critical. He has been supervising the work of protection day and night. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Xun Changjiang Flood Prevention Association, seeing that the Yangtze River water had receded and the Yellow River water had risen, telegraphed the Executive Yuan on the 17th to allocate 30,000 burlap bags stored in the association for Yellow River flood relief and immediately notified the Yellow River Conservancy Commission to collect them. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) According to a telephone call from Siyang County on the afternoon of the 17th, the Yellow River water had reached Likou in the county. The acting Magistrate of Huaiyin, Pan, immediately relayed the telegram to the counties in the district to pay attention to prevention, and sent special commissioner Zhu Yayuan, etc., to rush to repair the dangerous construction areas because Likou was only 60 li away from the county. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) The water level in the Suqian Canal suddenly rose sharply on the morning of the 17th, three or four feet higher than the original water level, coming from the upper reaches. It is generally believed that it was caused by the flooding of the Yellow River water into the Shahe Weishan Lake, which overflowed into the Canal. (17th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) Pan Zhongjia, the Administrative Inspector of the Eleventh District of Jiangsu, convened representatives of various agencies on the 16th to discuss the prevention of Yellow River floods and jointly determined six measures: (1) Telegraph Xuzhou to inquire about the current situation of the abandoned Yellow River, (2) Open the Yangzhuang Dam, (3) Request the Canal Works Bureau to open the Guijiang Dam, (4) The county government will cooperate in recruiting flood relief workers, (5) Request the provincial government to send personnel to Shandong to investigate and report on the water situation, (6) The Huai Pi section will investigate and report on the water level in the upper reaches of the canal to facilitate liaison. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) With the Yellow River flooding, northern Jiangsu is in imminent danger. The Jiangsu Provincial Government sent Wu Tongju, a technician from the Department of Construction, to Beijing on the 17th to consult with the Huai River and Yellow River Conservancy Commissions on emergency repair and defense projects. People in Jiangsu Province plan to set up a temporary engineering agency to protect the lives and property of the people in the area and recommend Han Guojun to preside over it and solicit personnel and experts from the Canal Works Bureau and the Water Conservancy Association who have experience in river works to jointly plan in order to eliminate disasters.

<h3 id="e2">Breach on the North Bank of the Yellow River <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Water Reaches the South Gate of Shouzhang</p>
<p>Han Fuju Telegraphed the Central Government Three Times to Appeal</p>
<p>(Jinan) At the hour of Zi today, the north bank of the Yellow River breached. The water has reached the south gate of Shouzhang, 40 to 50 meters wide and 6 to 7 meters deep. Tonight, it may reach Taochengpu and enter the main river. Zhang Lianjia believes that the Jin embankment on the north bank has not seen water for a long time and may be dangerous. He is scheduled to inspect the upstream on the 18th. Also, the breach on the south bank has surrounded the county town of Chengwu, which is very dangerous. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Han Fuju telegraphed the Lin Jiang Wang Internal Relief Committee three times, appealing for the breach of the Yellow River in Hebei and Henan, which flooded the counties in western Shandong and turned them into swamps, to plan for blocking the breach and provide urgent relief to save the lives of the people, not only because western Shandong was flooded but also because there was a danger of cutting off the Jinpu and Longhai roads and seizing the Huai River, and asked for instructions to obey, etc., and also telegraphed Hebei, Henan, and Yu Liu to quickly plan to block the breach. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) The Relief Committee held an emergency meeting today and decided to allocate 4,000 for urgent relief, and the Red Swastika Society allocated 2,000. (17th Dispatch) (Jinan) Shaanxi telegram, the water level dropped by 3.1 chi, the water level is 293.94 meters. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) The provincial government decided not to hold a large-scale commemoration of the third anniversary of September 9th due to the heavy flood disaster in western Shandong. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beijing) The current flooding of the Yellow River in Henan is extremely serious. Chinese news says that the number of drowned people has reached 50,000. However, such statistics may not be true. In northern Henan, the streets of several cities are flooded to a depth of five feet. The magistrate of Kaocheng County has moved the county government to a location not far from the city due to the water situation. All parts of the city are flooded, and 40 prisoners have drowned. The rest have been moved to the city walls. Xuzhou is also in danger of being flooded. The water situation in Henan has a tendency to return to the old course of the Yellow River, so every effort is being made to protect the dikes so that Xuzhou will not be flooded. Troops are assisting in handling this matter. The residents of Dangshan and Fengxian on the Longhai Railway are extremely frightened by the impending flood and have placed sandbags at the gates of each city to prevent the water from rushing into the city. (17th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beijing) A certain foreign engineer recently returned to Beijing from the flood-stricken area. A Reuters reporter interviewed him tonight. According to him, the Yellow River flood disaster in Henan Province is serious and has not been seen for many years. However, the saying that lives have been lost is a bit of an exaggeration, because the residents had ample warning and had moved to high ground. Now that the water has gradually receded, the disaster may not be more serious. However, the accumulated water cannot be completely drained for a while. The Yellow River bridge pillars have sunk slightly. Although the bridge body is still on the water, trains are temporarily not allowed to cross the bridge for safety reasons. He did not go to see the disaster area in western Shandong, but according to reports he received, the disaster area is about 2,000 square miles, with a population of 1.5 million. When the reporter asked about the Yellow River diversion, the engineer replied that, in his opinion, the Yellow River will not be diverted, because the river water is now gradually receding and the rainy season has passed.

<p>People Climb Trees to Escape</p>
<p>(Tianjin) After the Yellow River in Henan breached at Changyuan, the flood reached Puyang on the 13th, and the momentum was extremely violent, and the rescue was ineffective. Puyang, Changyuan, and Dongming counties suffered extremely severe disasters. Telegraph and telephone communications are currently interrupted. The provincial government ordered an allocation of 30,000 yuan for flood control, but it has not yet been issued. According to a telegram from County Magistrate Zhang of Puyang on the 16th, since the flood reached Puyang, the water has been over ten feet deep, which has not been seen in decades. Houses have collapsed and few have survived. Dozens of miles south of the city are a vast ocean. People climb trees to escape, which is unbearable to witness. He led the gentry day and night to guard the city. The city was flooded. At 1:00 a.m. on the 14th, in the jurisdiction[] the water exceeded the top of the dike in some places. On the 15th, the water surface in more than ten li from the Hetou area below the fifth district to the Liutun area above exceeded the top of the dike. More than 5,000 civilians were gathered to do their best to rescue, and finally escaped danger. At the same time, civilian boats were collected to enter the water for rescue, and disaster relief associations and shelters were set up to collect disaster victims and provide food on a daily basis to avoid starvation, etc. (17th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Yellow River water continues to rise. The telegram and telephone lines in Puyang and other counties have been cut off. People are seeking survival in green trees. The provincial government allocated 30,000 yuan for blocking the breach, but it had not been remitted by the 17th. (17th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Hankou) According to road news, the Pinghan up and down special express trains have resumed operation on the 17th because the Yellow River water has receded slightly. Ordinary passenger and freight trains are temporarily difficult to resume due to fears of increasing the danger of the iron bridge. (17th Dispatch) (Hankou) According to road news, after throwing stones, only 50 to 90 holes of the Yellow River Railway Bridge are still in danger, and the rest are safe. From the 17th, special express trains with a tonnage of about 20 tons can be pushed across the river by manpower. Each car requires about three hours of human pushing. Then the locomotives are replaced on the north and south banks and driven separately. Passengers and cargo on ordinary express trains and freight trains are still transported across the river by barges. (17th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beijing) He Jingwu went to inspect the north bank of the Yellow River Railway Bridge and returned to Beijing tonight. He told people that this time the iron bridge was damaged by the flood, and only the stone piers in the middle section of more than 20 holes were tilted and shaken. After the water recedes, repairs can be made to restore normal traffic. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) The Ministry of Railways sent Wu Qiyou to Xuzhou on the morning of the 17th to inspect the Yellow River Railway Bridge. (17th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Military Commission denied setting up a Northwest Military Branch Council in Chahar, saying that Song Zheyuan is responsible for the military aftermath in Chahar Province, and there is no need to set up another agency. The establishment of the Ping Military Branch Council was necessary because of the past external military affairs in North China, and there must be an agency responsible for military affairs. There is no need to set up a Northwest Military Branch Council in Chahar Province. (17th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beijing) Song Zheyuan arrived in Ping at 11:15 p.m. on the 17th. According to him, the organizational system, military pay, and garrison location of the Chahar army must be discussed with He. After the discussion is settled, he will return to Chahar in a day or two. Fang Ji and others are national talents and he will find ways to make them contribute to the country. Chahar Province is barren and the people are poor, and there are many troops, so all of the 29th Army will enter. In addition to a part maintaining law and order, most of them will remain in their original defense areas. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beijing) Song Zheyuan previously planned to invite Jiang Bocheng to go to Chahar Province to assist in everything. Because Jiang was busy, he could not go. Or Tu Sizong, a staff officer of the Military Branch Council, will follow to assist in everything. The local authorities here have been meeting for days to discuss the steps to resolve the Chahar issue and decided (1) to adopt the principle of appeasement and reorganization of the miscellaneous troops, and the uniforms, supplies, and pay of the troops will be designated by the highest authority; (2) after Song arrives in Zhang, he will immediately summon the leaders of the miscellaneous troops to a meeting to plan and settle the arrangements. Sun Liangcheng, Zhang Yunrong, Fang Zhenwu, Ruan Xuanwu, etc. are currently in Zhang. Sun and Ruan telegraphed Song, expressing that they will take the national interest as the premise. In the future, Song may send personnel to escort them to Tianjin to live in Tianjin. Fang expressed that if there is a guarantee, he is also willing to come to Ping to serve as a member of the Military Branch Council and live in Ping. Zhang Yunrong has not yet expressed his opinion. The troops of Deng Wen, Li Zhongyi, Liu Zhendong, and Zhang Renjie have been verified to be about 14,000 people. It is also planned to find ways to selectively incorporate the troops of Liu Guitang, etc. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beijing) Song Zheyuan requested that the central government send senior officials to Chahar to assist in handling the aftermath of Chahar Province. The local authorities here have telegraphed the central government and Jiang for approval, and there should be a reply telegram in days. Song previously asked the central government to appoint Pang to preside over Chahar, or send another senior official to be responsible. Jiang telegraphed Ping on the 12th, saying that he had not heard the details of the telegram. The smooth takeover of Chahar's administration should maintain the original agreement and it is appropriate for Brother Mingxuan to return to Chahar as the chairman, and there is no need to discuss Brother Mingxuan's recommendation to Chen Ji to succeed him, and he has telegraphed to earnestly comfort and retain him. Also, Jiang telegraphed Ping on the 15th, saying that Brother Mingxuan's handling of the Chahar affairs this time was uniquely painstaking and his planning was thorough, which is truly admirable. The Chahar situation is initially stable, and there are countless aftermath issues. He fully expects Brother Mingxuan to continue his efforts, and the Chahar situation should not be changed if possible. The previous telegram has also been telegraphed. Brother Mingxuan is benevolent in Chahar and must not be willing to leave at this time. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beijing) Guan Linzheng's division is now ordered to move to the areas of Damangling, Songjiaying, Yaojiaying, and Zhaochuan Fort in Xuandong. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beijing) Emergency relief in the war zone will be dispatched in days. First, 500,000 will be allocated to relieve the counties that have been heavily affected by the disaster, and agricultural relief will be handled after the treasury bills are issued. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beijing) Song Zheyuan is scheduled to return to Ping from Tianjin tonight and go to Zhang tomorrow to handle the aftermath. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beijing) Song Zheyuan is scheduled to return to Ping today. After discussing with He Yingqin, he will return to Zhang. Song expressed to others that after sorting out the military and political affairs of Chahar Province, he will give way to a more capable person and recommend Pang to be the chairman of Chahar again. Jiang telegraphed Song yesterday to express his condolences and hoped that Song would continue to work hard. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beijing) Guo Zhihan was ordered by Song to go to Zhangjiakou this afternoon to officially take over the Finance Department. Seven members of the Chahar Provincial Committee have been internally appointed. In addition to Song concurrently serving as the chairman, there are also Qin Dechun, Guo Zhihan, etc. The head of the Education Department will be Lu Fu. Another Mongolian prince will be appointed as a member and is currently seeking agreement. The other one has not yet been decided. The military expenditure of Chahar Province has been agreed upon by the Military Branch Council and the central government and is 150,000 per month. Song is presenting to the Military Branch Council and the central government to discuss increasing the amount because this number is only enough for two divisions. The troops of Feng that should be dismissed will be handled by the Military Branch Council allocating special funds separately. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beijing) Jiang Bocheng said that the Chahar affairs have come to an end. After Song returns to Ping, he will go to Chahar immediately. He will be responsible for all military and political reorganization. The rumors that Song is unwilling to be responsible are rumors, and the statement that Fang Ji has a tough attitude is also untrue. When he was in Chahar, Fang was in Wanquan and did not get to meet him. He telegraphed to invite Fang to Ping to serve on the Military Commission, but Fang has not yet expressed his opinion. The reorganization of the miscellaneous troops will be presided over by Song. Because the miscellaneous troops lack supplies and the Dolon area is poor, they are also very willing to be reorganized. It is predicted that it will proceed smoothly. After Zhang Xueliang returns to China, there are rumors that he will be appointed to an important position in the northwest. He has not heard of it. This question is too far from the facts to be discussed. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beijing) The reorganization of the Chahar army is presided over by Song Zheyuan. The standards are divided into two parts: (1) The former Northeast Army, the righteous army of Su, Ma, Wang, Li, etc., or those who were commissioned by the Military Branch Council during the Anti-Japanese War will be reorganized. (2) The militia or bandit-style troops will be investigated in advance. If they are militia, they will be returned to the people. For bandits, it is necessary to check whether their discipline, uniforms, and guns are complete. After verification, they will be organized and dispatched separately, and Song Zheyuan will send personnel to verify them. He Sui has become passive due to the difficulties in dealing with his troops and plans to go to Lushan in days to visit Jiang and resign. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e8">Feng Yuxiang Climbs Mount Tai <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Staying at the Five Worthies Shrine</p>
<p>(Jinan) Feng Yuxiang arrived in Xindian, northeast of the city, today to mourn the tomb of Zheng Jinsheng. He passed by Caiyuan Village, got out of the car, bought steamed buns, noodles, and garlic, and ate them heartily. Han and Feng both bowed three times to Zheng's tomb. Zheng Jicheng's brothers knelt beside him. More than 20 members of the Zheng clan were present. Feng also held a bowl of bean soup and offered it to Zheng's tomb, telling the Zheng clan that the Zheng clan had this heroic son who avenged his father, which is world-famous. On the way, Han told the villagers that this was Commander-in-Chief Feng, and everyone was surprised because Feng was wearing coarse cloth. At ten o'clock, he detoured to Luokou and returned to Ji'nan. At noon, he went to the Jinde Association. At 3:15, he went to the station with Han. The special train went south. Because Feng did not allow farewells, only a few people such as Zheng Jicheng went to Tai'an. Deng Zhexi stayed in Ji'nan, and Zhang Jiyong and Li Qi followed. He arrived in Tai'an at five o'clock. The county magistrate and officials of various agencies went to the station to welcome him. He got out of the car and took a mountain sedan chair up the mountain. The old and young farmers on the mountain came out to welcome him, exchanging greetings. The old monk Qingshan of Puzhao Temple welcomed him to the middle of the mountain. Feng said, "I'm here to trouble you again." Feng went straight to the Five Worthies Shrine to rest. Feng told reporters that Shandong has new construction and a new atmosphere, which is different from other provinces. It is not easy because maintaining the local area and protecting the people is a good thing, but sometimes people do not allow it to be done. Han is having a hard time persevering. The reporter followed Feng to Mount Tai, chatting along the way, and saying many sad and indignant things. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) This morning, Han Fuju and Feng Yuxiang visited Chengtou Road, Tiegong Temple, Beiji Temple, and Lixia Pavilion. They took a car together to mourn Zheng Jinsheng in Chengdong, and offered two wreaths at ten o'clock. They scheduled to go to Mount Tai on the 18th.

<p>(Beijing) Pang Bingxun released a statement before leaving, saying that the army was ordered to enter Chahar and He [] instructed him to handle everything. After the troops advanced to the planned location, Feng repeatedly [] advised him. Now that Feng has left Zhangjiakou and Chairman Song has been ordered to go to Chahar, someone is responsible for the military and political affairs, and [] all the arrangements have appropriate solutions. As for Song repeatedly telegraphing the central government, [] he talked about the chairman's position, and the society was not aware and thought that there must be a background. In fact, it is not the case. The army has always taken the country as the premise, and has never considered personal power. Moreover, the two armies have gone through thick and thin for many years and are close friends in life and death. Both publicly and privately, they should do their best to assist so that the Chahar situation can be settled as soon as possible. Moreover, [] he is popular and will be able to resolve disputes when he returns to Chahar to preside over the administration. If Song comes to the border defense, he will be able to consolidate the entire national defense and the overall situation in North China, and he has a necessary to do his best to assist. In the past, it was rumored that the army had fled to a certain regiment or battalion, and he dared to say that even one soldier or one man did not abscond. He would not argue about everything, and it will be clear in the future. (17th Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e11">Thoughts After the Inauguration of the Pan-Pacific Association (Actual) <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>The Pan-Pacific Association held its inaugural meeting on the 14th of this month in Banff, Alberta, Canada. The meeting was originally initiated by religious groups. The initial intention was not to involve actual political and economic issues, but only to exchange opinions on academic matters, promote emotional connections among the people of the Pacific Rim countries, and facilitate cultural communication. The intention was very good. Even the agenda to be formulated at this conference sought to avoid discussing the entanglements between China and Japan and did not want to cause fierce disputes during the meeting. The concerns were indeed comprehensive. However, in this era of increasingly close global transportation, it is impossible not to be related to politics and economics at any time and place, especially on the Pacific Rim, which has the most complex international relations. The Japanese representatives had close ties with the Japanese government from the beginning. Their policies and responses to all issues were in step with the foreign policy of the Japanese military. Therefore, the representatives of other countries, for the sake of their own national positions, could not help but express their views. Therefore, it is probably impossible to avoid political discussions. If all countries in the world truly had a pure gentlemanly attitude when it comes to international diplomacy, the World Economic Conference would never have ended unhappily. Although this economic conference is different in nature from the Pan-Pacific Association, their aspirations for peace and international cooperation are the same.</p>
<p>Focusing on pure ideals, who would not want the countries on the Pacific to be as peaceful as the United States and Canada, as Mr. Falconer, the Canadian representative, said, and strive for international harmony? However, based on past facts and careful observation of the current environment, this hope is very slim. For now, let us temporarily set aside the situation of confrontation and conflict in European countries and the global economic panic. Just focusing on one corner of the Pacific, the three northeastern provinces, which are the powder keg that could trigger a second world war, the Japanese army has been rampaging for a year and ten months. An irreparable rift has been created between the Chinese and Japanese nations. Moreover, the Japanese financial groups are forcefully excluding other powers in China to consolidate the economic foundation of Japanese imperialism. They are also greatly expanding their military power to make Manchuria the first line of defense for their army. This means that it is difficult to expect peace in the Far East in military terms.</p>
<p>Japan has used its domestic cheap labor and our country's low-cost raw materials, coupled with the depreciation of foreign exchange rates. Japanese products have had a good opportunity to be dumped overseas. Towards our China, it is as if entering an unpopulated area. Even the colonies under the protection of the British Empire, such as India and East Africa, are affected by the dumping of Japanese products. At this point, Britain cannot but urgently seek to respond. The economic alliance, which had not been fully realized since the Ottawa Economic Conference, was immediately intensified and implemented after the failure of the World Economic Conference. From India to various parts of Africa, and the British South Seas Islands, tariffs were raised. The fierce economic competition between Britain and Japan on the west coast of the Pacific is very obvious. This is also evidence that peace between Britain and Japan is not easy.</p>
<p>After Japan had disagreements with the British Empire, it felt the pain of a narrow market. Therefore, it also advocated pro-American arguments, hoping to indirectly get help from the United States during the economic struggle between Britain and Japan, or at least adopt a neutral attitude. However, the United States remained silent on the goodwill of the Japanese. What can be seen is that they are doing their best to expand their navy and plan to build thirty-two new ships in the next three years, with a planned increase in the budget of US$238 million. The intentions of the United States are clear. At this point, Japan also put forward a second supplementary plan to build thirty-five new ships within three years, with a budget of 590 million Japanese yen, and increase eight naval air squadrons. The military competition between Japan and the United States is so fierce. This is also evidence that peace in the world is not easy.</p>
<p>The situation in the Pacific is as described above. Looking at the countries of the world today, from the rulers to the majority of the people, most of them are like fools, engaged in preparations for war, regarding war as the only means to resolve current contradictions. Is there really any hope for peace today? Having a heart for peace, but without the equivalent strength, then peace will ultimately be empty words.</p>
<p>I hope that our people will learn from the mistakes of the past, observe the current situation, and not be misled by the empty name of "peace" again.</p>
<p>The Disarmament Conference will reopen in October. The United States is unwilling to discuss naval ratios.</p>
<h3 id="e12">Secretary of State Hull Declares <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Shipbuilding Has Not Exceeded Treaty Limits</p>
<p>Cannot Be Seen as an Arms Race</p>
<p>(Washington) Recently, in view of the United States consolidating its naval base, carefully repairing its coastal defenses, and Japan also having plans to expand its navy, it is generally said that the two countries are engaged in naval arms competition. Secretary of State Hull declared today that the naval construction plans of the United States and Japan have not exceeded the tonnage limited by the Washington Treaty and cannot be regarded as an arms race. Hull also said that when the Disarmament Conference reopens on October 16 this year, the United States will not discuss the naval ratios of various countries, because this issue should be left to the London Naval Conference in 1935 for discussion. The Secretary of State said that the trend of the Disarmament Conference is very good and hopes to achieve results. Someone asked whether Germany wants to violate the Treaty of Versailles, expand its defensive military power, and cause trouble for various countries. Hull replied that Germany's desire to avoid disputes is the same as that of other countries and they will certainly understand the need for international peace. (Havas News Agency, 16th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Davis, the U.S. representative to the Disarmament Conference, said today that he hopes to find some solutions to the disarmament problem at the Disarmament Conference to be held in Geneva on October 16. At present, the United States is unwilling to discuss the issue of naval ratios. This issue will be reserved for discussion at the naval conference in 1935. The current shipbuilding plans of the United States and Japan do not have the intention of competition, because neither has exceeded the stipulated ratios. Davis is currently in Washington consulting with President Roosevelt on everything. He said that he is now waiting for the call from European leaders to carry out preparatory work in London in early September. (Reuters, 16th)</p>

This has been confirmed today by U.S. Navy Chief of Staff Swanson. After hearing that European countries, especially France, have invented new aircraft with outstanding endurance, people inquired Swanson about the U.S. Navy's invention of new aircraft. Swanson said that the aircraft has not only been successfully manufactured but has also been test-flown. The rumored superior performance is indeed true. The aircraft is a pursuit aircraft. The test flight results confirmed that it can surpass other aircraft. The details of its structure and engine are kept secret and cannot be disclosed. (Kokumin News Agency, 16th)</p>

<p>The Osaka Asahi Shimbun published an article on August 10th titled "To Counter China, Our Air Force Will Also Greatly Expand." Since the Shanghai Incident last year, China has known the power of our (Japanese) Air Force and is making great efforts to expand. Its first step is to conclude a contract with a certain party to strengthen its air force. Recently, the Army received information from various sources that China has been actively researching aviation. It is said that within a few years, China will complete more than 800 bombers, reconnaissance planes, and fighter planes, which will be comparable to the total number of aircraft in our (Japanese) Army. If the five major airfields in Shantou, Quanzhou, Zhenhai, and Haizhou are completed, not only will Taiwan be threatened, but the entire Japan will inevitably be surrounded by the action range of the aircraft. The danger of a Japanese air raid is unimaginable. If Taiwan is allowed to be ravaged by Chinese aircraft, it will cause major problems for our (Japanese) national defense. In addition to preventing this through international treaties that directly do not infringe on Japan's interests, we must study countermeasures. The Ministry of the Army is preparing to greatly expand the air force to resist. In order to keep Manchuria and North China under our (Japanese) control, we plan to control the airspace of Kyushu and Taiwan in the future to ensure the air supremacy of southern Japan.</p>

Since it is not sure, it still wants to announce it.

<p>Japanese Representatives Quietly Complain About the Boycott of Goods in British Territories. Hu Shi Says: Japanese Aggression Will Only Promote Chinese Unity</p>
<p>Banff - During a roundtable discussion on Pacific trade at the Pacific Association today, many representatives believed that depreciating currency exchange rates and lowering wages are not legitimate ways to deal with international trade competition. This issue was raised during the discussion of the Anglo-Japanese textile dispute. The Japanese representatives argued that the high taxes imposed by the British territories, which effectively exclude non-British-made cotton fabrics, have caused great pain to Japan. The British, Canadian, and American representatives said that forming large industrial organizations and creating a national sales system are completely legitimate actions. However, it is difficult to agree with the method of depreciating the currency while also lowering wages. Although some of the Japanese representatives wanted to agree with the principle of this theory, they said that the tariffs that India intends to increase are too high and hinder Japanese trade. In addition, the representatives were unanimous in their opinions on subsidized export trade. Even the American representatives expressed their disapproval. (Kokumin News Agency, 16th)</p>
<p>Banff - Chinese representative Hu Shi told visitors here today that Japan's military aggression in northern China, Manchuria, and Shanghai has instead promoted the unification of various factions in China. Therefore, as a result, the situation in China has generally improved. It is hoped that this progress will continue without interruption so that it can attract foreign investment. It seems that Japan still does not know for sure that China will never tolerate the expansion of Japanese power in North China. Japan's attempt to control the area has increased the tension between the two countries. Therefore, there is currently no sound basis for restoring Sino-Japanese friendship. (Kokumin News Agency, 16th)</p>
<p>Banff - The Pacific Association held a meeting to discuss the differences in living standards among countries in the world, saying that tariff barriers and immigration bans are caused by this, and currency chaos is another cause of international disputes. The Japanese representative stated the reason why Japan buys American cotton instead of Indian cotton. Because India increased tariffs and tried to abolish the Indo-Japanese Commercial Treaty, Japan took this retaliatory measure. He also said that the value of Manchuria in terms of accommodating Japan's surplus population has not yet been proven. The current value of Manchuria is the richness of the "undeveloped materials" there. The Chinese representative explained that Manchuria is the tail end of China's surplus population and claimed that the issue of the Chinese boycott of Japanese goods would be studied, and finally said that the boycott policy is not permanent.

<p>Decides on Four National Policy Outlines</p>
<p>Hatoyama Visits Araki to Seek Understanding</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Minister of Education Hatoyama visited Army Minister Araki this morning to report on the negotiations between the Seiyukai and the government to agree on national policy. He said that the outline that the Seiyukai wants to propose is on the issue of national defense, so it wants to seek the consent of the military. It is heard that Hatoyama will ask to see Navy Minister Osumi another day to make the same report. This behavior of the Seiyukai is indeed to curry favor with the military. Its intention is very clear. (Hualian News Agency, 17th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) At 10:00 this morning, Minister of Education Hatoyama met with Masayoshi Maeda and Advisor Uchida at Nobuya Uchida's residence. Hatoyama reported on the process of contacting Prime Minister Saito and stated his opinion that the agreed national policy should be limited to the outline, without mentioning the details, otherwise it would be difficult to achieve satisfactory results. The four national policy outlines advocated by the three giants of the Seiyukai are as follows: (1) National defense plan for the army, navy, and air force after 1936; (2) Complete political and economic policies for "Manchukuo"; (3) Economic reconstruction policy after the failure of the World Economic Conference; (4) Crackdown on the Communist Party and rectification of official discipline, etc. (Hualian News Agency, 17th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) As a result of the secret talks between Prime Minister Saito and Secretary-General Horikiri, Prime Minister Saito is scheduled to meet with President Suzuki on Tuesday and Wednesday of next week to discuss the agreed policy and the issue of ministers without portfolio. If President Suzuki raises the details of the policy, Saito intends to reiterate his thirteen-point political program and ask President Suzuki to agree. Otherwise, he will only discuss the principles, and the details will be discussed at a later date. It is rumored that the result of the Seiyukai leaders' meeting seems to be to propose its so-called three major guiding principles and ten major policies as the basis for agreement.

<p>Issue of the Authority of the Director of the Administration</p>
<p>Board of Directors on the Verge of Breaking Up</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The non-negotiation between Russia and the puppet state on the Chinese Eastern Railway resumed its fourth private consultation at 9:00 this morning. The issue of today's contact is the exchange rate of the ruble. If the exchange rate is determined, this negotiation may break through the crisis, but the current situation is still difficult to predict. (Hualian News Agency, 17th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Ohashi, the representative of the puppet state, submitted a proposal at 2:00 p.m. today during the private negotiation on the transfer of the North Railway, saying that it is firmly believed that the transfer price of the North Railway of 50 million Japanese yen is fair and should not be increased. The conversion of rubles must take into account the current value of the ruble and other circumstances, so it is appropriate to value one ruble at 25 cents of Japanese yen. He also said that this proposal has been carefully considered and proposed, so he hopes that the Soviet Union will agree to it. The Russian representative Kaczlovsky said that the Russian representative did not have a specific plan regarding the conversion rate today, but expressed that he would study it before the next negotiation and then express his opinion. He expressed dissatisfaction with the proposal from the puppet state. The negotiation ended at 3:00 p.m. The next meeting is scheduled for the 28th. (Dentsu News Agency, 17th)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Li Shaogeng, the puppet supervisor of the Chinese Eastern Railway, visited Pander, the director of the administration, today to discuss the issue of the equal power of the director and deputy director of the administration, and proposed that the outline of principles be submitted to the board of directors for resolution. However, Pander insisted on making a concrete decision first and refused to compromise, resulting in no results. Supervisor Li expects the results of the board of directors meeting on the 18th. In order to prepare for any eventuality, he intends to report the illegal acts of the director of the administration to the board of supervisors and the audit bureau and has ordered an investigation. If the board of directors meeting on the 18th breaks down, relations with Russia will become more complicated. (Dentsu News Agency, 16th)</p>

<p>Limit of 1,500 People per Country</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a telegram from the Consulate General in Batavia to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Annam government proposed a draft decree on immigration at the Council on the 15th and does not allow it to be announced immediately. The content of the draft decree is to adopt a system of limiting the same number of immigrants from each country each year. If the total number of immigrants in that year is less than the prescribed number, it may exceed one-tenth of the total number of immigrants in the past ten years. The total number of immigrants is 25,000, and each country is limited to 1,500 people. The average total number of Japanese immigrants between 1923 and October 1932 was 821, so it has no direct impact on Japan, but it is feared that it will hinder future overseas development, so it is given great importance.

<h3 id="e25">U.S. Recovery Plan Encounters Setbacks <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Roosevelt Urges Steel Industry to Cooperate, 60,000 Men and Women Garment Workers Declare Strike</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 16th - The U.S. President, seeing that his industrial recovery plan is facing real danger, met with the two leaders of the American steel industry who came to Beijing yesterday for a long talk. The U.S. President is deeply concerned about the attitude of the steel industry towards the recovery plan. However, according to people in the White House, the President still does not intend to use harsh means to force the industry to obey, but only wants the industry's full cooperation and wants to hear its opinions. It is expected that the President will persuade the two to give the government the necessary cooperation. As for the attitude of the representatives of the steel industry, it is said that they are also willing to cooperate, but they want to obtain an understanding of the government's position on organized labor. It is heard that the President assured today that the purpose of his industrial plan is only to improve the labor situation and that he has no intention of forcibly unifying the principles of labor in any industry. The steel industry was one of the first to submit industry rules. It is expected that the main objection of the industry is to certain conditions added to the industry rules, because it is believed that these conditions are initiated by Green. The government is also working hard to mediate the strike wave of coat and women's clothing workers because it is feared that it will indirectly affect the textile industry, which employs one million workers. Although the industrial recovery plan has encountered setbacks, according to statistics from the Department of Labor, the number of employees in July increased by 7.2% compared with June, and the total amount of wages paid also increased by 7.93%.</p>
<p>National News Agency, New York, 16th - After 2,500 coat tailors in New York City went on strike yesterday, 60,000 men and women garment workers in women's clothing factories in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut went on strike today, claiming that they would not resume work until wages were increased and treatment was improved. Representatives from the U.S. Department of Labor and the Industrial Recovery Administration have been mediating for 48 hours without success. The most painful thing for coat workers is that most of them are not directly employed by manufacturers, so they are exploited by big and small contractors. Therefore, they demand the abolition of these intermediaries and direct employment by manufacturers. As for the workers employed in clothing factories, they claim that their wages are not enough to live on and that the treatment in most factories is harsh. Disputes in the coat industry have been going on for several months. Newly, 22,000 male coat tailors went on strike and were temporarily resolved. According to today's situation, it is feared that the strike wave will extend to other industries, such as fur and textile industries, which may be affected.</p>

<p>Havas News Agency, Washington, 16th - Before the industry rules for the news media are finalized and adopted, the temporary industry rules set by the government continue to be in effect. Various newspapers have now joined the temporary industry rules and have been able to use the blue eagle, which represents national economic recovery, as a symbol.</p>

<p>Luo Wengan Inspects Xinjiang</p>
<h3 id="e27">President Wang Concurrently Assumes Duties of Foreign Minister and Minister of Justice, Vice Minister Zheng to Act on His Behalf <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government issued an order on the 17th stating that Luo Wengan, Minister of Foreign Affairs and concurrently Minister of Judicial Administration, will go on a tour of Xinjiang. All duties of the Minister of Foreign Affairs will be concurrently assumed by Wang Zhaoming, President of the Executive Yuan, with immediate effect. [This is according to a Central News Agency dispatch on the 17th.]</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Since Huang Musong, the Central Government's envoy to comfort Xinjiang, returned to Nanjing and reported, the Central Government, considering Xinjiang's strategic border location, has appointed Liu Wenlong as Chairman and Sheng Shicai as Supervisor to ensure local affairs are managed. Regarding central government affairs such as foreign affairs and transportation, it is deeply felt that there is a need to dispatch senior officials for further inspection and separate handling. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and President Wang Zhaoming have repeatedly requested President Dai Chuanxian of the Examination Yuan to go. President Dai therefore traveled quickly to Guling to discuss everything in person. However, due to his health not being fully recovered, it is difficult to travel long distances in the short term. Minister Luo of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs then agreed with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and President Wang Zhaoming to personally inspect Xinjiang. A report was submitted at the political meeting on August 16th. During Minister Luo's inspection, the duties of the Minister of Foreign Affairs will be temporarily assumed by President Wang, while the duties of the Minister of Judicial Administration will be handled on behalf of him by Vice Minister Zheng. The political meeting has already approved it, and it is said that a clear order will be issued soon. [This is according to a Central News Agency dispatch on the 17th.]</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Luo Wengan will be tasked with inspecting Xinjiang. Reporters have learned that he will depart within a week after the order from the National Government is issued. Those traveling with him include Lin Donghai, Counsellor of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Yu Zhiang, Secretary, and Feng Youzhen, Secretary of the Ministry of Justice, totaling seven or eight people. The first group will travel by plane first. Luo and the second group will enter Xinjiang via land routes through Henan, Shaanxi, and Gansu, inspecting the judicial plans of various provinces, transferring prisoners to build roads, and developing transportation in the Northwest. After arriving in Xinjiang, he will visit important cities and towns in the Xinjiang border area, which is expected to take about four or five months. Transportation from Shaanxi and Gansu to Xinjiang is of utmost political importance, so Luo is determined to find a way to open it up. Although there are mountains and rivers obstructing the way from Tongguan, Xi'an, Lanzhou, Suzhou, Hami to Dihua, it is all accessible by automobiles. Therefore, Luo has purchased automobiles in Shanghai, making full preparations. After on-site inspections, he will immediately begin preparations to move young prisoners to build roads and cultivate land. The outline of the measures for the prisoner relocation and cultivation plan, consisting of fourteen articles, has long been drafted. [This is according to a Central News Agency dispatch on the 17th.]</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Government dispatched Foreign Minister Luo Wengan to inspect Xinjiang and other provinces like Henan, Shaanxi, and Gansu. Luo has scheduled his departure before the 25th. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has dispatched Counsellor Lin Chunxian and Secretary Yu Baoxuan, while the Ministry of Judicial Administration has dispatched Secretary Feng Nanzhen and Section Chief Liu Yinglin to accompany him on the inspection. During the inspection period, the duties of the Foreign Minister will be temporarily assumed by Wang, and the duties of the Minister of Justice will be handled on behalf of him by Zheng Tianxi. The Central Political Council approved this on the 16th, and the Executive Yuan submitted it to the National Government on the 17th for formal issuance and appointment. A clear order will be issued immediately. A reporter recently met with Luo, who provided detailed information about his aspirations for this trip. He mentioned that the actual situation in the Northwest frontier awaits investigation. He, holding positions in both the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Justice, deeply feels that the current judicial situation in Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu, and Xinjiang, as well as the Sino-Soviet trade relations in the Xinjiang border area, need inspection and rectification. He will travel from Tianjin-Pukou Railway to Longhai Railway, passing through Kaifeng, Lanfeng, Zhengzhou, Luoyang, Tongguan, and other places, with stops at each location. He has also prepared long-distance automobiles to go to Xi'an and Lanzhou. He plans to inspect the three provinces of Henan, Shaanxi, and Gansu for about two months, and then spend two months in the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains in Xinjiang, for a total of about four months. Tents and dry rations will be self-prepared. Shao Lizi and Zhu Shaoliang have both sent telegrams saying that they will send teams to escort him through the areas he passes. The total journey is 8,000 miles. In today's chaotic judicial system, prisons everywhere are poorly equipped and overcrowded with criminals. Although the government has recently issued an order to reduce sentences, it is not a fundamental solution. What I want to solve on this trip are: (1) to investigate the actual situation of the courts' implementation of criminal law; (2) to properly plan livelihood plans such as relocating criminals to build roads and self-reform measures. The former will serve as the basis for revising the criminal law, and the latter is an important plan for rectifying the current judicial system. He will discuss practical strategies with local authorities and court officials. Xinjiang is adjacent to Russia, and the trade relationship has never been completely cut off. The former Xinjiang authorities signed a partial trade agreement with Russia. He will bring a draft of this agreement and assess the actual situation, so that when a formal Sino-Soviet trade treaty is signed, the special relationship of the border area will be fully understood.

<p>Imperialists Conduct Conspiracy</p>
<p>Using Xinjiang as an Anti-Soviet Battlefield</p>
<p>Muslim Rebellion Instigated by the Japanese</p>
<p>(Moscow) Today, Pravda, in an editorial extensively discussing the recent situation in Xinjiang, pointed out that the western provinces of China have become the stage for a grand conspiracy by British and Japanese imperialists. It stated that imperialists are mobilizing and preparing to realize their grand plan of conquering the entire Central Asia and transforming the entire region into a battlefield for anti-Russian policies. The newspaper stated, "Xinjiang has long been noticed by imperialists (primarily Britain), because the province is a most important link in their policy of controlling Asia. If British imperialism occupies Xinjiang, it will surely be able to realize its plan for Central Asia, in which the forcible seizure of the Soviet Republics of Central Asia occupies an important position. Britain's plan to create a Greater Tibet includes not only Tibet but also Xinjiang, Sichuan, and other parts of China. At the same time, Japanese imperialists are planning to create a Greater Manchuria Kingdom, whose territory will include Manchuria, Inner and Outer Mongolia, Tibet, Sichuan, Shanxi, Gansu, and Xinjiang. The recent Muslim rebellion in Xinjiang, led by General Ma Zhongying, was actually instigated by the Japanese. These Japanese are taking advantage of the oppression of the masses by the Han authorities, the friction between various feudal groups, and the hatred within the ethnic groups to reap benefits. However, representatives of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang oppose Ma's plan to establish an independent country, and the Japanese imperialists in this plan are extremely eager to make the exiled Turkish Prince Abdul Kerim the head of the independent state." The newspaper continued, stating that the actions of rebels in the Kashgar area of Xinjiang to seize power are becoming increasingly tense, while the guidance of the British in this rebellion movement is extraordinarily active. Although Ma Zhongying's forces in northern Xinjiang have been defeated, there are still many remnants of the rebel forces. These armed forces under the direction of the Japanese are led by Turkish officers, who can still be used in a new war when establishing a Pan-Islamic independent state. Pravda concluded, stating, "The conspiracy of the imperialists in Xinjiang is now proceeding vigorously. The imperialists are preparing their strength to realize their grand plan of subjugating Central Asia, and the British and Japanese imperialists are using the area as a battlefield for anti-Soviet policies."

<p>(Moscow) Pravda, the organ of the Communist Party, pointed out that the Japanese plan to build a Greater Mongolia has revealed its threat to Outer Mongolia. The beginning of this threat coincides with the Japanese military's invasion of Chahar. Pravda believes that General Feng Yuxiang's actions indicate that he is willing to assist the Japanese "Manchu" army in advancing into Chahar, and then declare his loyalty to "Manchukuo." Pravda stated, "The fall of Dolon is actually the Japanese military's occupation of important routes to Chahar, directly heading to the border of Jehol, northwest to the capital of the Mongolian People's Republic, Kulun, and simultaneously reaching Zhangjiakou."

It is heard that Li Liejun's proposal to resolve the situation in Chahar was accepted by Chiang.

<p>(Nanjing) Xu Xinwu, a member of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, has been appointed to preside over the dikes of the lower reaches of the Yellow River. He is scheduled to go to Zhenjiang on the 18th to negotiate measures with the Jiangsu Provincial Government, and then proceed to northern Jiangsu and the provinces of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan to jointly prepare for the Yellow River Conservancy Commission. Wang Yingyu, the vice chairman, returned to Nanjing from Lushan on the 17th to follow the Central Government's planning for governing the Yellow River. According to him, the dikes along the Yellow River have been in disrepair for many years, and the effectiveness of the existing facilities is decreasing day by day. Due to economic constraints and the lack of time, comprehensive plans for fundamental solutions cannot be carried out. Therefore, the Commission plans to use temporary measures to prevent major disasters, namely: 1. Diverting the Tao River into the Wei River to reduce the amount of sand in the ocean, while the silt in the Hetao region can flow into Ningxia with the water. 2. Expediting the construction of smoke stone dikes from Mengjin to Gubaizui and water containment projects from Mengjin to Dongming. 3. Dredging the river mouth dikes below Lijin. 4. Disposing of a large amount of huge stones to reinforce the Yellow River Railway Bridge. 5. Utilizing the army and workers for construction. However, this project requires a huge amount of funding and must wait until Minister Song returns to the country to find ways to plan and implement it. Recently, it has been necessary to rely on the concerted efforts of the four provinces of Hebei, Shandong, Henan, and Jiangsu to jointly plan and prevent dredging and other matters. It would be fortunate if the disaster area could be kept from becoming too large and the disaster situation could be kept from becoming too severe.

<p>Zhangjiakou - Song Zheyuan's telegram states, "To all newspaper offices, since the loss of Rehe, Chahar Province has become the first line of national defense. Troops defending against aggression are stationed everywhere, and defeated soldiers and bandits have retreated into Chahar. The burden of providing supplies is heavy. When Dolon fell, the anti-Japanese army rose up. The land is small and the number of soldiers is large. All means of exploitation have been used, and all vehicles and livestock have been requisitioned. The people have fled, displaced and in dire straits. The vitality of the region has been greatly damaged. Now that the military affairs have come to an end and order is gradually being restored, the villages in the northern counties of Kou have become ruins and are now places with land but no people. The counties along the railway have been frequently requisitioned, and grain and fodder have been exhausted. Bandits are everywhere, and the people have no means of livelihood. This originally poor border region has experienced an unprecedented catastrophe. Externally, the strong enemy has not yet been subdued, and internally, the starving are everywhere. The disaster situation is extremely severe and requires urgent rescue. Zheyuan is responsible for comforting and providing relief but lacks the ability to do so. Seeing this scene of devastation, my heart is burning with anxiety. In addition to sending telegrams to President Wang and Chairman Chiang, and the North China War Zone Relief Committee, requesting them to send personnel to Chahar to investigate the disaster and provide relief, I beg you to show great compassion, help us through this difficult time, and make a collective appeal to rescue the dying remnants. I will sincerely pray for your blessings. Song Zheyuan, stamped." [This is according to a special dispatch on the 17th.]</p>

<p>Bandit Activity Rampant in Qian'an and Lulong</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese army is using huge sums of money to recruit bandits from various places outside the pass and escort them to the Great Wall border to disband. At present, two to three thousand bandits have gathered along the border wall. The Kwantung Army Department has stated that if China is unable to eliminate the bandits, the Japanese army will eliminate them on their behalf for the sake of the peace and tranquility of the border. [This is according to a special dispatch on the 17th.]</p>
<p>(Beiping) Since the takeover of Qian'an and Lulong counties, administrative difficulties have been felt due to the rampant bandit activity in the area. Now that a vigorous clearing campaign has been carried out, the bandit activity has been slightly suppressed. In the Jianchangying area, there are still more than 500 Japanese garrison troops, and a supply station has been established. Although the area has been taken over by Fang, these troops have not yet shown any signs of withdrawing. There is also a small number of Japanese troops, about several hundred, in Qian'an city. The puppet army of Li Hongwen in Qian'an is now being reorganized by Li Jichun sending personnel. As for the issue of taking over the Yuguan county seat, there has been no news from Ping since Liu Shisun went to negotiate with the Japanese side.

<p>Explanation of His Conversation with Gao You Tang</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhou Dawen told reporters on the 17th that the remarks made by Supervisor Gao You Tang regarding the issue of the national salvation donation are quite different from the facts. The allocation of the national salvation donation has always been decided and approved by the donation federation before it can be disbursed, and it is not something that can be decided by one or two people. As for the purpose, it has also been stipulated long ago and is not limited to air defense. The previous time when the subordinates of Su Ma came to Beiping, 10,000 yuan was spent, which was decided by the meeting. The donation in Beiping will still be used in Beiping and cannot be considered excessive. I hope that Committee Member Gao will conduct a thorough investigation, understand the truth, and avoid misunderstandings. [This is according to a Central News Agency dispatch on the 17th.]</p>

<h3 id="e68">Iraqi Incident <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Gu'er People Massacre the Innocent</p>
<p>British Prime Minister Seeks Friendly Advice</p>
<p>Reuters dispatch from London, 17th: The seriousness of the recent Assyrian incident in Iraq can be seen from the British government's formal protest and the British ambassador's hasty return to Iraq. According to sources in London, 1,500 Assyrians near Mosul, north of the Tigris River, rebelled under the leadership of Mahim Meng. The Iraqi army went to suppress the rebellion, killing 500 Assyrians, but only 90 of those killed were actual rebels. The rest were civilians living in nearby villages. In one village, 315 innocent people were killed. It is believed that the Gu'er people in the Iraqi army, who have always been hostile to the Assyrians, used the insignificant rebellion as an excuse to massacre the innocent. The commander of the northern Iraqi region, Beike'er, is also known for his hatred of the Assyrians. However, Iraq denies the incident, saying that there has been no fighting since the rebels surrendered their weapons on August 11. King Faisal of Iraq has suspended his travels and will return to the country within days.</p>
<p>Reuters dispatch from London, 17th: British Prime Minister MacDonald, who was vacationing in the countryside, has suddenly returned here. It is said that this is due to the massacre of hundreds of Assyrian Christians in Iraq. Foreign Secretary Simon is on sick leave, and the Prime Minister has agreed to act as Foreign Secretary in his absence. That is why he urgently returned to London. Official circles here are deeply anxious about the news of the massacre of over 300 people and King Faisal of Iraq's planned trip abroad. Although Britain is no longer the trustee of Iraq, and therefore not practically responsible, Iraq's independence was proposed by Britain. Now that the situation is deteriorating, some powers will again argue that Iraq does not yet have the qualifications of a nation. The Assyrians fought alongside the Allies in Mesopotamia during the European War and are now being massacred, which may provoke public outrage among the Allied countries. The Iraqi army in the north has indeed been subjected to considerable provocation, but the current situation is largely due to King Faisal's poor management. If King Faisal had a firm hand and punished those responsible, especially the northern army commander Peizhi'er, who is friendly to Turkey, the situation could be salvaged. It is expected that British Prime Minister MacDonald will do his best to advise King Faisal, in a friendly diplomatic manner, not to leave the country at present and to take a firm stance.</p>

(4) The general manager of the new bank will be decided by the president of the Bank of Japan. The Ministry of Finance authorities issued a statement regarding the merger of the three banks, saying that the three banks automatically implemented the merger to promote rational management. The three banks, in view of the economic situation, organized a strong new bank to prepare for future activities, which is very gratifying. The integration of banks with strong individual characteristics into a common new bank is of great significance. It is said that the formal signing will be implemented in November.</p>

<p>All generals above the rank of Major General must attend to improve the military system and strengthen national defense.</p>
<p>Nanchang correspondence: Chairman Chiang has recently paid close attention to strengthening national defense. He recently convened a military committee in Lushan to discuss reforming the military system, piloting the division and conscription systems, building national defense, and expanding the navy and air force. According to military sources, Chiang is convening a national military conference in Jiangxi on September 15th to understand the actual situation of the armies, divisions, and brigades across the country in order to effectively rectify and reform. All generals above the rank of Major General must attend. All domestic military agencies and division commanders and independent brigade commanders have been ordered to comply and to prepare detailed reports and proposals to be submitted for review in advance. The location of the meeting, whether in Lushan or Nanchang, has not yet been determined. It is also said that it has not yet been decided whether all the generals will attend in person. This is because Jiangxi, Guangdong, Fujian, Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, Henan, and Sichuan provinces are all in a tense period of bandit suppression, and it is feared that it will be difficult for the generals to leave their posts. Therefore, it is still under consideration whether the generals will attend in person, send representatives to participate, or submit written statements. (August 13) The Southern Route Army advances towards Changting.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Communication Established Between Anyuan and Xunwu <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou correspondence: After suffering setbacks in Liancheng, the Communist bandits in western Fujian, the 19th Route Army has gathered heavy troops and is advancing towards Changting. At the same time, it informed the Southern Route Bandit Suppression Army on the Guangdong-Jiangxi border to advance in different directions to divide the bandit forces. Recently, the Second Column of the Southern Route Bandit Suppression Army, the Huang Renhuan Division, has mobilized four regiments to guard Shanghang and another three regiments to deploy in Wuping. At the same time, the Seventh and Eighth Divisions also advanced from Xunwu. The Second Independent Division, Zhang Ruigui's unit, took over defenses in the Jiaoling and Pingyuan areas. The Fifth Division of the Second Army, Zhang Da's unit, also advanced to Xingning for deployment. The units of the First Column in southern Jiangxi, after arriving near Anyuan recently, have not been able to establish contact with the Seventh and Eighth Divisions of the Second Column in Xunwu because several bandit strongholds north of Anyuan have not been captured. Currently, the Anyuan garrison, Zhang Meixin and Wang Zanbin's divisions, are conducting a search and suppression operation towards Zun Sanwei, and have successively broken through twelve bandit strongholds in the area. The remaining two bandit strongholds have been under siege for more than a month, but without success. Recently, the Third Air Force Team, led by Tao Zuode, has been transferred to Longnan, and sends planes with bombs to bomb the bandit strongholds every day. The troops are also fiercely besieging. By the 8th of this month, more than 800 bandits broke through and fled due to the destruction of their defenses and the exhaustion of their food. They were intercepted by government troops along the way, suffering more than 100 casualties. The remnant bandits fled to Huichang via Datangxu and Shangxiaping. On the same day, Wang Shi's Zhou Yuan Regiment occupied one of the last strongholds of the Communist bandits, while Zhang Shi's Kong Regiment is now stationed in Dongshixu, Li Regiment is stationed in Banshixu, Chen Regiment is stationed in Gangtouzhai, and Jiang Regiment is stationed in Longtou. Currently, the northeast and northwest of Anyuan have been solidified by the deployment of Zhang and Wang's divisions. In the future, the First and Second Columns of the Southern Route Bandit Suppression Army will have established considerable contact between Anyuan and Xunwu. The situation in the Huichang bandit lair in eastern Jiangxi is becoming increasingly dangerous. It is expected that the Jiangxi bandits will not dare to invade south in the short term, and may implement a plan to flee north and invade west. According to a telegram from Chen Cheng of the Central Bandit Suppression Army yesterday, more than 1,000 Red Bandits suddenly attacked Fengcheng, three miles from Fuzhou, on the 5th of this month. They were armed with sharp weapons and were quite rampant. The defending forces near Fengcheng were weak and had to temporarily retreat to the city. The rice fields outside the city have all been looted by the bandits. Chen Cheng has deployed a certain unit to prepare to encircle and suppress the bandit forces. (August 13)</p>
<h3 id="e74">Yellow River Overflow in Western Shandong <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>The Water Level of the North Canal Rises Sharply</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Yellow River in Hebei and Henan has flooded western Shandong. Heze and Cao County have already seen water, and it is now flowing everywhere. Today (14th), the water has reached Gaodigou in Heze County and is continuing to overflow eastward. The water that breached Shitou Zhuang on the north bank of Changyuan has reached Zhangqingying, 18 li from Fan County, today (15th). The water flows downstream along the Dike South Jiahe ditch, and has not overflowed the banks. It is 1.67 meters deep and 40-50 meters wide. The provincial government has sent Councilor Zhang Shouqian and Deputy Director Wang Shaochang of the Zouping Rural Construction Institute to Caozhou to assist in prevention and investigate the disaster to provide a basis for relief. As for the North Canal (Wei River) in northern Shandong, the water level has risen sharply due to continuous heavy rains. According to a telegram from Yao Xintian, a technician sent by the Department of Construction to Dezhou, and Li Shude, the magistrate of De County, the water level has exceeded the highest flood level by one foot and three inches, and the water depth is one zhang and four chi and eight cun, which is two chi and two cun from the top of the dike. According to a telegram from Zhen Guangyuan, the magistrate of Wucheng County, the river water is continuing to rise. The water level is 30.248. The old brick of the Qiliting Gray Dam has collapsed, and the Sanlikou Gray Dam is also overflowing by three to four inches. The magistrate is supervising the civilians to rush to repair it. The Department of Construction has ordered all counties along the river to step up precautions to prevent the floods in western Shandong from spreading to northern Shandong. The telegrams from Wucheng and De counties are recorded below. (1) Telegram from Wucheng: Addressed to Zhang Jun, Director of the Department of Construction. We have reported the situation of the rising and falling water level of the canal in this county by telegram. Now we have checked the canal water level. From 6:00 p.m. on August 12th to 2:00 p.m. on the 13th, it has risen by about three cun and three fen. The current water level is 30.248, which is only three cun away from the highest flood level in recent years. There have been heavy rains every night for the past three days, and the water level has been rising every day. The old brick in front of Qiliting has collapsed, and the gray dam has been overflowing for three to four inches since that day. The magistrate has personally led civilians to add soil and repair the dam by more than two chi. There are no other dangerous signs in other places. In addition to working with Li Cishan, a technician from the Department of Construction, and Liu Shuxiang, a water conservancy commissioner, to supervise the civilians and police day and night to do their best to protect various dangerous projects to prevent unforeseen circumstances, we hereby report to you for verification. Zhen Guangyuan, Magistrate of Wucheng County, bows to you. (2) Telegram from De County: (1) Addressed to Zhang Jun, Director of the Department of Construction. The canal water has been rising again since the 11th, rising sharply by six chi and eight cun in three days. The current water level has reached 15 chi and 7 cun, which has exceeded the highest flood level by one chi and two cun. It is still rising. In addition to paying attention to protection, we hereby report to you. Yao Xintian bows to you. (2) (Title omitted) On August 13th, the canal in De County was 24 chi and 8 cun deep, which is two chi and five cun higher than yesterday, and two chi and two cun from the top of the dike.

<h3 id="e75">Guangdong Province Restrains Women's Clothing <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Department of Finance Orders Female Staff to Respect Themselves</p>
<p>Bureau of Social Affairs Prohibits Bare Feet and Short Skirts</p>
<p>Guangzhou correspondence: District Fangpu, special commissioner of finance and director of the Department of Finance, recently issued a notice on the 10th to the female staff of the department, admonishing them for continuously improving their clothing and losing their solemnity. The notice stated, "It is hereby noted that women serving in government agencies are government employees. Regarding their appearance and clothing, they should have a solemn appearance. Although there are no regulations for female staff uniforms, they should still be simple and unadorned. However, it has recently been found that some female staff in the department cannot avoid being vulgar and pursue fashion, decorating their hair and nails, applying powder and rouge, and wearing green and red clothes to compete with each other, which degrades their personality and loses their solemnity. It is urgent to correct this in order to save the declining habits. You are hereby instructed to follow this notice. In the future, you must refrain from being extravagant, wash off your makeup, and wear homespun clothes. Do not deliberately violate this, lest you be investigated. This is of utmost importance."</p>
<p>Zhang Yuanfeng, director of the Guangzhou Bureau of Social Affairs, also stated that licentious appearance leads to immorality, and there has long been a ban on it. Strange and enchanting clothing is of great concern to public morals. Moreover, many women in the city often go barefoot, and the cicada gauze and brightly colored clothes they wear are colorful, and the lower skirts are also shortened, causing passersby to stare. It is inevitable that young people with unstable blood will be involved in immoral thoughts. In order to rectify public morals and save declining customs, they should be banned. Therefore, it is now planned to standardize things so that women know what to follow. All strange clothing is prohibited. It is said that the plan has been completed and will be implemented soon.

<h3 id="e76">Shaanxi Province Floods Worsen <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Affected Area Reaches More Than Thirty Counties</p>
<p>Disaster Is Unusually Severe, Unseen in a Century</p>
<p>Xi'an correspondence: Since 1928, Shaanxi Province has been plagued by droughts. People in various counties have been displaced, and the fields in rural areas have been barren and desolate. The tragedy of the disaster is unbearable to hear. Since the beginning of summer this year, there has been frost and hail, affecting sixty to seventy counties. After the summer harvest, the harvest throughout the province has been poor. Most of the victims have nothing to live on. Recently, heavy rains have continued to fall, causing mountain torrents and rivers to swell. Countless houses have been washed away, and countless people and livestock have been washed away. In Qiaodi Town, Jingyang alone, more than 1,000 corpses have been found. Near Louti Village in northeastern Sanyuan, nearly four to five thousand bodies have recently been found, which is truly shocking. After the heavy rains, telegrams and letters from various counties reporting to the government and requesting relief came one after another.</p>
<h3 id="e77">A Glimpse of the Disaster <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>The counties affected by the floods include Chang'an, Sanyuan, Xianyang, Jingyang, Weinan, Huayin, Hua County, Dali, Pucheng, Fuping, Fufeng, Lantian, Chaoyi, Baoji, Chunhua, Wugong, Pingmin, Gaoling, Hu County, Changwu, Yichuan, Shiquan, Lin County, Ziyang, Yulin, Mizhi, Luochuan, Fugu, Jingbian, Jia County, and other thirty-odd counties. Among them, the areas around Zhongnan Mountain and the mountains north of the Wei River are the most severely affected. It is reported that during the torrential rains, the rivers flowing down the mountains, as well as the Chan River, Ba River, Li River, Jue River, and Zao River, all swelled suddenly. In addition, mountain torrents from the valleys broke out, which were extremely fierce. As a result, houses in places such as Kuyukou, Dayukou, Xiaoyukou, and Tangyukou were completely washed away. Property and belongings could not be moved in time. Residents and passing travelers were unable to escape and drowned. According to a preliminary investigation, no fewer than 10,000 residents have drowned. From Yukou to Gaoqiao, a distance of seventy li, all the fields along the river were washed away, totaling more than a thousand qing. The corpses of residents who were washed away by the water, with missing hands and feet, were everywhere along the river. They were all washed to the confluence of the Chan and Ba rivers and eventually floated on the beach along the river. The situation was so terrible that people could not bear to look at it. Lu Yu Yan, south of the city, is a historically famous levee. There is a saying, "If the Lu Yu Yan is breached, Chang'an will disappear." Its importance is evident. This time, it was breached, causing the area outside the south gate of the provincial capital to become a vast ocean. The water only receded after more than ten days. In the Weibei area, the water volume of the Qing and Zhuo rivers in Sanyuan suddenly rose to eight or nine zhang. The villages and houses along the river were all washed away, and hundreds of men and women drowned. No fewer than a thousand qing of farmland were washed away. In Jingyang, the Zhiyu and Qingyu rivers and the areas along the rivers have all become swamps. Even the famous and largest water conservancy project, the Jinghui Canal, was damaged by the raging water. According to a report from the Shaanxi Water Conservancy Bureau, the bridges and culverts of each main canal could not discharge the water in time due to the heavy rain. The most severely damaged was the Minsheng Bridge on the main canal, which was completely washed away, leaving only the bridge holes. A section of the stone bridge on the North Canal and more than ten places on the embankments of the main canal were breached. Several places downstream of the Baofeng Temple on the South Canal were washed away, and farmland was also irrigated in places with high canal bottoms. The bureau has urgently assessed the bridges and culverts and will implement emergency earthwork as soon as possible to avoid further damage. During this mountain torrent, the residents along the Shichuan River in the territory of Fuping Linzhang suffered particularly severely. South of Fuping, more than 500 homes have been washed away below Xiangqiao, and no less than a thousand qing of farmland has been submerged. According to local farmers, this flood is rare in a century. In the Wei River Basin, except for Yangping Town in Baoji, which was affected by the rising river water and washed away two-thirds of the town's streets and more than ten large and small villages, the loss was relatively small because there were few residents along the coast. Therefore, only a few beaches were flooded. In the Yellow River Basin, the number of houses and fields washed away along the river is even more countless, especially in Pingmin and Chaoyi. It is said that when the Pingmin River rose sharply, most of the West Gate Tower, temples, and houses collapsed. The area from the east gate of the city to Yongji County in Shanxi Province became like a river, which shows the magnitude of the water. The area within the territory of Chaoyi County, east to west for twenty to thirty li, has become a vast ocean. The situation is even worse. The areas affected by the floods in the counties of northern Shaanxi are also very large. However, the reports received are not detailed. The above is only a description of the most severely affected areas. In other counties such as Wugong, Shiquan, and Changwu, there is almost no way to investigate the houses and fields washed away and the people and livestock drowned. Shaanxi Province, which has always been known as a drought-prone area, has actually developed into such a strange disaster.</p>

<h3 id="e78">Office of Funds and Property Cables Request to Exempt Additional Grain Tribute <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>The grain tribute in Jiangsu Province is the heaviest in the country. During the era when Sun Chuanfang governed Jiangsu, an additional two yuan per stone of winter tribute was levied, to be deducted in the following year. However, year after year, not only has it not been returned, but it has also been levied continuously. The people have been burdened for three years. The Office of Funds and Property of this county previously submitted a request for exemption, and received a reply limiting it to one year. Therefore, they advised them to endure the pain and complete the payment. Recently, there has been talk of continuing to request the Ministry of Finance to continue the additional levy. The director of the Office of Funds and Property, Li Zuhua, believes that the rice price has fallen sharply this year, all industries are declining, and the economic situation in rural society is showing decline. It is already on the verge of bankruptcy, which shows that the people are poor and the wealth is exhausted. If the additional levy is continued, the people will find it difficult to bear the burden. He sent a telegram to the Ministry of Finance, Minister Song, and Provincial Chairman Gu today (17th), urging them to approve the cancellation of the proposal to continue the additional levy of the winter tribute in order to relieve the people of Jiangsu.</p>

<p>Youth Commits Suicide in Suzhou, Suspicious</p>
<p>On the 13th, a young man in a western suit, who looked handsome, came to the Dadong Hotel outside Yanmen. He wrote his name as Huang Wen, a native of Guangdong, 25 years old, studying at Fudan University in Shanghai. He opened room 213. After the guest lived in the room, he never went out, and no one came to visit. The tea attendant, Wang Liansheng, was suspicious, so he paid attention. He then saw him writing several letters quickly and going to the post office to mail them himself. One of them was discovered by Wang to be addressed to Ms. Lu Fuzhen, No. 99 Shiquan Street, Suzhou City, with the words "Dragon Seal" written below. He only went out once on the evening of the 16th. After returning, he ordered the tea attendant to buy ten packs of white tin. He then lay down after a moment of enjoying the cool air. On the morning of the 17th, Wang Liansheng saw that he had not gotten up. When he went to check again at noon, he saw that he was already unconscious. He immediately reported to the Second Division of the Public Security Bureau and sent the guest to the hospital. However, just as he was being carried to the back door, a long-distance call suddenly came from the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, saying that there was a person named Huang Wen who had come to commit suicide and asking them to pay attention. The guest was carried to the nearby Suyong Hospital, where Dr. Gu Suyong urgently rescued him. It was found that he had taken sleeping pills. At 5:00 p.m., he was still unconscious. However, Dr. Gu discovered that the words "Long Xun" were written on the reverse side of the young man's western suit pants. Combined with the words "Dragon Seal" on the letter to Shiquan Street, it can be determined that his real name is Long Xun. Afterwards, two waste envelopes were found in the spittoon in the guest's room, both addressed to Director Wen of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau for opening. There were also two suicide notes, one to the reporter and one to the Dadong Hotel. After the incident, it caused a stir in society. The reporter telegraphed Officer Tang of the Second Division of the Public Security Bureau, and learned that No. 99 Shiquan Street was the residence of a Sichuan widow, Ms. Lu Min. The relationship with the suicide victim, and whether Long's letter had been delivered, is still under investigation. The original text of the letter left to Dadong Hotel was, "To the owner of this hotel, I am sorry to use your hotel as a place to kill myself. I know this is not right, so I am very sorry. But I do not owe any rent, and I have prepared 20 yuan (in the silver bag) to compensate you for all your losses, which I think will not be a big problem. Please keep my body here temporarily, and someone from Shanghai will take care of everything." The letter to the newspaper office said, "Mr. Reporter, I am not heartbroken, nor am I unemployed, nor am I under economic pressure, nor is it due to any disputes. People's personalities are different, and their viewpoints are also different. My passive suicide is a very different idea from others. As for the reason, it is still up to the reader to study. How can I not say it? Please do not exaggerate the matter in the newspaper."</p>
<p>Another long-distance telephone message said that the young man in a western suit who committed suicide with sleeping pills at Dadong was named Long Daozhen, a native of Qiongzhou Prefecture, Guangdong Province, and a relative of Director Wen. He was formerly a patrol officer in the Second District of Shanghai and is now transferred to the General Bureau as a patrol officer. His parents are both in his hometown, and he was engaged since childhood. The reason for his suicide this time was dissatisfaction with the marriage. At 6:00 p.m., the Shanghai Public Security Bureau had sent Long He, a member of the First Section, and Wen Dake, the chief inspector of the police brigade, to Suzhou. His girlfriend, Lu Fuzhen, also called the hospital to inquire about the truth. It was found that Lu was 21 years old and a famous socialite in Suzhou. She went to the capital to work this spring and now lives at No. 99 Shiquan Street, Suzhou.</p>

<p>Sun Apan, near Le Hu on Hulong Street, is a local vagrant. Yesterday afternoon, he returned home from outside and went straight into his mother's room. He unexpectedly saw a man, whose name he did not know, sitting on the edge of the bed in his mother's room, talking to his mother in a soft voice. He believed that he must be his mother's lover and immediately drove him away. However, his mother protected him, so Sun Apan became enraged and took a knife, slashing the man's neck fiercely. At that time, the skin broke and blood flowed, but the man was timid and did not dare to fight back. He fled outwards with his injury. Sun Apan wanted to chase after him, but was held back by his mother, so he had to let him escape. The incident was known to the police district in charge and is currently under investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Imminent Danger to the Chongming City Southern Seawall <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Chongming is located at the mouth of the Yangtze River, surrounded by the sea, and is the throat of the Yangtze River, a strategically important place for coastal defense. Since its establishment as a county in the Song Dynasty, due to the erosion of the river water, the land has been constantly collapsing and expanding, and the county seat has been moved five times. In the twenty-sixth year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty, the local people successively petitioned the government to build a stone seawall more than a thousand feet long on the south side of the city, and the people donated 5,000 mu of sandy fields, which were named "Seawall Public Fields," as funds for the annual repair of the seawall. Over the years, the seawall has been repaired and has remained safe and sound. In the seventeenth year of the Republic of China, the outer sand area of the county was separated for governance (now Qidong). As a result, all public properties were divided item by item. Although the plan was decided, it has not yet been implemented. Last year, people from Chongming and Qidong counties requested joint governance, but the plan was shelved by the provincial government. Recently, the seawall project on the south side of the county seat has been in extreme danger. The Department of Construction sent a supervising engineer to measure the site. In front of the Qinglong Dam, the whirlpool depth reached 45 meters and the width was nearly one mile. More than 20 feet of the stone slope have collapsed. It is estimated that the repair project will cost more than 100,000 yuan. People are panicked. The county Kuomintang first telegraphed the province to petition for relief. The county farmers' association and other organizations, as well as local gentry such as Wang Qingmu and Zhu Songhan, jointly submitted a petition to the province to request the issuance of overdue subsidies and the public rents of the seawall occupied by Qidong County in order to carry out emergency repairs. They also sent Cheng Tiyun, a member of the county executive committee, and Tao Zhu, the director of the property department, to the province to petition the provincial government and the finance department. During the high tide of this month, more than three feet of the stone slope collapsed again, and the danger is extreme. If funds are not raised for repairs, the consequences will be unimaginable.</p>

<p>Gao Yihan, a member of the Control Yuan of the National Government, arrived in Wuxi by train from Suzhou at 12:40 PM on the 16th, accompanied by his secretary Huang Renzhong and two servants. He stayed in rooms 24 and 25 of the Railway Hotel. Zhou Erkai, the chief prosecutor of the county court, Yan Shenyu, the county magistrate, and Ye Dezhen, the secretary, went to the hotel to pay their respects after receiving the news. Mr. Gao inquired in detail about the local political situation. Yesterday morning, at 8:00 AM, he went to the county government, the county court, the prison administration, the detention center, the police station, and the education bureau for inspection. The results were satisfactory. According to Mr. Gao's statement to reporters, the purpose of this trip is to inspect the public sentiment in Jiangsu Province and the dike construction in Jiangbei, and the Songbao seawall project, which have recently been inspected. As for the impeachment case of Zhao Qi, the authorities have their own handling methods. There is no news about the reorganization of the Jiangsu Provincial Government. When Mr. Gao inspected the county government, he was received by County Magistrate Yan, who led him to the county magistrate's office. After a brief exchange of greetings, Mr. Gao immediately inquired about the administrative situation of Wuxi County, asking about the situation of public security, autonomy, land tax, and education. He also inquired about the general situation of the Wanye Guidance Center. County Magistrate Yan gave him a detailed account one by one. Mr. Gao also paid close attention to the prison issue. Prisons in various counties are often overcrowded. He inquired into the reasons, whether it was due to the delay in trying cases or the small size of the prison buildings. Now Mr. Gao is going to various counties for on-the-spot inspections to find out the truth. Mr. Gao is scheduled to leave Wuxi for Nanjing at 12:00 PM today (the 18th).</p>

<p>The slaughter tax in Wu County has always been contracted by Liu Hesheng. Butchers have repeatedly accused him of illegally overcharging. Recently, the annual term has expired, and Liu Hesheng still contracted the tax for 29,000 yuan and issued a notice to collect it. Upon hearing the news, the butchers sent representatives to the county government and the county Kuomintang on the afternoon of the 16th to request relief. At that time, they advised the merchants to directly ask the Education Funding Management Office for instructions on how to handle the matter and wait quietly for a solution. The butchers' representatives, failing to obtain a satisfactory result, immediately convened a general meeting of all members of the Meat Industry Association at 5:00 PM and unanimously decided to temporarily stop slaughtering pigs. More than 20 members have all suspended business, and representatives have been sent to the Jiangsu Provincial Education Funding Management Office to petition for the removal of Liu Hesheng. They must wait for instructions before resuming business. Therefore, since the 17th, except for those who are related to the slaughter tax, who continue to operate as usual, all others have unanimously suspended business.</p>

<p>Wang Zhen, the special agent of the 34th Regiment of the Sixth Army and the director of the Hangzhou garrison, colluded with Zhou Lihe, the former clerk of the Sixth Army, to carry a large number of red pills. They were seized in the provincial capital and transferred to the Provincial Security Office for interrogation. According to Wang's confession, the red pills were entrusted to him to be transported to Quzhou. Zhou Lihe denied the accusation of carrying red pills, claiming that he was going to the front line in Jiangxi with Wang Zhen. However, according to Wang's confession, they were indeed transporting them together. It was found that Wang Zhen, as an active duty military officer, dared to collude with Zhou Lihe to shield the smuggling of red pills, which was a serious crime. According to the Criminal Law of the Army, Navy, and Air Force and the regulations of this province on eliminating drugs, he was sentenced to death. With the approval of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, the Provincial Security Office sent personnel to the military prison yesterday (the 17th) at 8:00 AM to bring out Wang Zhen and Zhou Lihe, verify their identities, and tie them to the open space of the first pier in Jianggan for execution by firing squad.</p>

<p>To Discuss Financial Issues, Expected to Return to Shanghai in About a Week</p>
<p>His Wife and Daughter Will Travel to Lushan</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's Military Affairs Commission specially dispatched a Sikorsky aircraft to Shanghai to welcome Kong Xiangxi, the governor of the Central Bank, to Jiangxi to discuss important issues related to the central finances and the aftermath of North China. Mr. Kong originally planned to start from Shanghai the morning before yesterday, but he was detained by various important official duties. Wu Lin, the vice minister of finance, also came to Shanghai from Nanjing the morning before yesterday to visit Kong and discuss everything, so he was unable to make the trip. It was delayed until 8:00 AM yesterday morning when he, his wife, Madam Soong Ai-ling, and his second daughter, Ling Jun, Sheng Shengyan, the secretary of the Ministry of Finance, and a female servant, a total of six people, took a private car from their residence to Hongqiao Airport, transferred to the Sikorsky aircraft, and took off at 8:40 AM. It was scheduled to arrive in Nanjing at 10:30 AM. He would stay in Nanjing for two hours, meet with Premier Wang Jingwei, and have lunch. At 1:00 PM in the afternoon, he would fly to Xunyang and then to Lushan. It is estimated that Mr. Kong would arrive in Lushan at around 6:00 PM yesterday to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. It is said that Madam Kong and her daughter were invited by Madam Chiang to visit Lushan. Mr. Kong told reporters before leaving yesterday that the most important task of this trip was to discuss the financial issues of American cotton and wheat. It is expected that he will stay in Jiangxi for at most one week and then return to Shanghai. He also said that the first batch of American wheat was not large, worth only tens of thousands of yuan. The rumor that it has been sold is absolutely not true, because the goods have not yet arrived in Shanghai, so there is no way to sell them.

<h3 id="e90">The Shipping Association Ordered Eighteen Fighter Planes and They Have All Arrived <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Twelve Planes Have Been Shipped in Three Batches</p>
<p>Also Shipped to Hangzhou School for Assembly</p>
<p>The Association Urges Collection of Solicited Donations</p>
<p>The Chinese Aviation Association ordered 18 Hawk fighter planes. In addition to the six that have already arrived, another nine arrived the other day. The Central Bank is responsible for customs clearance and delivery, and they have been shipped to Hangzhou for assembly. The newspapers have reported on this. According to Lin Wojiang, the secretary-general of the association, the remaining three planes also arrived at the same time, making a total of twelve, which have been taken and loaded onto trains to Hangzhou. Mr. Lin himself also took a car to Hangzhou in the afternoon. The details are described as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e91">Shipped to Hangzhou Yesterday <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Lin told reporters that the association ordered 18 fighter planes from the United States. In addition to the six that have already arrived, these twelve have also arrived at the same time. The Central Bank is responsible for loading them onto the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway and shipping them to Hangzhou. They are still being assembled at the aviation school's aircraft factory. I myself am scheduled to take a car there at around 4:00 PM to inspect the five planes that were previously shipped there for assembly and to inspect the opening of the boxes of the twelve planes that were shipped this time. Therefore, the date of return to Shanghai will be around the beginning of next week. The names of the twelve planes that arrived this time have not yet been decided. Only the municipal fresh meat industry and the municipal hotel industry have acknowledged the purchase of one plane each. Therefore, the names of these planes still need to be discussed at a meeting.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Urging Collection of Donations <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>The results of the solicitation period of the Chinese Aviation Association were not as expected. However, in order to arouse the enthusiasm of the people, 18 planes were purchased first. The total value has exceeded the total amount of donations received. Since the end of the solicitation team, it has been difficult to collect the pledged donations. Now that all 18 planes have arrived and are about to be paid for, the solicitation team has been urged again to ask the team leaders to be responsible for collecting the donations and to continue to work hard to raise funds. However, before the funds are collected, the Central Bank is temporarily requested to pay in advance.</p>
<h3 id="e93">American Far East Trade <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Still Holds Leading Position</p>
<p>The "Ta Mei Wan Bao" (Greater America Evening News) said that the trade of the United States in China and the Far East can still be the best compared to other countries, and it has been in a leading position in import and export trade for three years. According to Chinese customs and other statistics, in the first six months of this year, 20.3 percent of China's imports came from the United States, and 18.51 percent of its exports went to the United States. Japan ranks second, and the United Kingdom ranks third. In recent months, trade between Japan and China has increased sharply, but it is still far behind the United States. Kerosene and its by-products, as well as tobacco, cotton, and timber, are the four elements that contribute to the large amount of American imports. Chinese cotton, eggs, leather, fur, peanuts, raw oil, silk, tea, wool, and antimony are the main exports from China to the United States. However, the benefits of trade after the recent increase in the price of silver have been mostly offset by the inflation of currency and the increase in prices in the United States. According to a report from the US Department of Commerce, in May of this year, the total value of US trade with the Far East was 51,375,000 gold yuan, an increase of 7,858,000 gold yuan compared with 43,517,000 gold yuan in April. Imports accounted for a larger portion of this increase. However, compared with the same period last year, it decreased by 3,643,000 yuan, or about 6.6 percent. Losses in 1933 commercial exports were particularly affected, apparently due to the price drop of certain American goods and oriental raw silk and hemp products. In May 1933, the value of goods exported from the United States to various countries in the Far East was 20,096,000 US dollars, a decrease of nearly 20.5 percent compared to 25,283,000 US dollars in May of the previous year. This loss, although a result of lower prices, is also due to the increase in production of domestic and foreign factories in various countries, so the sales of goods from Europe and the United States have decreased. Exports to Japan alone saw an increase, jumping from 5,883,000 US dollars to 8,676,000 US dollars. Exports to China decreased from 4,545,000 US dollars to 4,217,000 US dollars. Exports to the Philippines decreased from 3,967,000 US dollars to 3,579,000 US dollars. The total value of export trade in May increased by more than 17 percent compared to the same month last year, an increase of 17,194,000 US dollars. The demand for raw cotton, timber, cigarettes, steel, refining, mineral oil, and freight cars is increasing in the East, while tobacco, machinery, automobiles, and electrical equipment are on a downward trend. Exports to Japan in May increased by 29 percent compared to April. The total value of goods exported to China increased from 3,444,000 yuan in April to 4,217,000 yuan in May.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Fang Jianfei is Suddenly Chopped by Thugs with Axes <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>The Shoe Industry Union Issued a Declaration Yesterday</p>
<p>To Petition the Party and Government This Morning to Arrest the Murderers</p>
<p>Xin Sheng She reports that Fang Jianfei, the executive director of the Shanghai Shoe Manufacturing Industry Union, was suddenly attacked by thugs with sharp axes at Ren Zhi Li, North Sichuan Road, at 9:00 PM on the 14th of this month, resulting in serious injuries and disability. The union issued a declaration and decided to petition the party and government agencies this morning.</p>
<p>Thugs Commit Murder The Shoe Manufacturing Industry Union told the Xin Sheng She reporter yesterday that Fang Jianfei, the executive director, is a worker at the Xianghua Shoe Store on Avenue Joffre. At 9:00 PM on the 14th of this month, while passing through Ren Zhi Li on North Sichuan Road, the entrance of the union, he met his colleague Fan Yiqiang. While they were talking on the road, more than ten thugs suddenly appeared, each holding a sharp axe and speaking in a Cantonese accent. Without asking any questions, they chopped at Fang Jianfei, causing both arms to break, and he fell to the ground unconscious. Fan Yiqiang was also affected. The police sent Fang to the Tongren Hospital for treatment. Seeing that their goal had been achieved, the thugs fled without a trace. After Fang was sent to the hospital, the doctor treated him, and his life was saved, but he was disabled. Fang is a worker in leather shoes and serves as the executive director of the union. He has no personal grudges on weekdays. Now that he has been assassinated, it is obvious that there is a background, hoping to disrupt the labor movement and eliminate the union organization. In addition to reporting to the court to severely punish the murderers, the union will submit a petition to the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau on the morning of the 18th, requesting assistance in strictly arresting those who destroy the labor movement.</p>
<p>Union Declaration The Shoe Manufacturing Industry Union issued a declaration yesterday, saying, "To the Central Party Headquarters of the Kuomintang of China, the National Government, the Party Headquarters and Courts of all provinces and cities, and the General Unions of all provinces and cities: Our union's executive director, Mr. Fang Jianfei, was passing through Ren Zhi Li, North Sichuan Road, at 9:00 PM on the 14th of this month when he met his friend Fan Yiqiang and exchanged a few words. Suddenly, more than ten thugs came, with fierce and brutal momentum, and suddenly took out sharp weapons such as knives and axes and chopped at our union's executive director and his friend Fan without asking any questions, causing them to suffer serious injuries. The police sent them to the police station and then to the hospital for treatment. The criminals were all hiding in Qinglu, No. 50, Tong De Li, Wuchang Road. Two murderers were arrested that night by detectives in the residence. The rest were missing. The case is still under trial in the First Special District Court on the 15th and has not yet been adjudicated. Fang Jianfei has always been peaceful and diligent in all union affairs, working hard and constructing in a systematic way, regardless of external affairs, and is deeply admired by his colleagues. The colleagues are extremely angry at the poisoning of this thug. This situation is that the murderer must have other organizations and many followers, with the purpose of trying to disturb the affairs of the association, destroy the labor movement, and assassinate officials. If these reactionary thugs are not eradicated as soon as possible, not only will our association be disturbed, but all organizations and groups in the city will be affected. Therefore, the colleagues unanimously rose up to help Executive Director Fang, so as to avoid the unjust sinking of the snow. We hereby request the principals of various institutions and groups to uphold morality, come forward to assist, be the backing of our association, and eradicate the reactionary thugs to calm the public's anger. It is fortunate for the society, fortunate for the colleagues. In addition to asking the court to severely punish the detained murderers and investigate the remaining accomplices, we are deeply afraid that all sectors of society will not understand the truth, so we hereby declare."</p>

<p>Merchants Have Forgotten the National Crisis</p>
<p>Goods Are Re-loaded onto Japanese Ships</p>
<p>Recently, Japanese steamship lines have been trying to recover and compete with Chinese and British companies for the export cargo from the northern and southern seas. Since this week, steamships traveling between North China and Japan, such as Nisshin, Showa, Daki, and Osaka, have ostensibly followed the regulations for export freight rates, but secretly they have been giving large rebates and indiscriminately reducing freight rates, even reducing the amount by 50 or 60 percent. General merchants, only seeking cheap fees, have re-loaded their goods onto Japanese ships. Therefore, in the past few days, most of the goods shipped from Shanghai to Qingdao and Tianjin have been carried by Japanese ships. Each Japanese steamship export is fully loaded, causing the business of the Chinese and British steamship companies' northern sea routes to be greatly affected.</p>
<h3 id="e97">The Volunteer Army Relief Association Held its Fifth Supervisory Committee Meeting Yesterday <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Telegram to the Government Requesting a Thorough Audit</p>
<p>The Supervisory Committee of the Northeast Volunteer Army Relief Association held its fifth meeting yesterday at 12:00 noon at the Bankers Association at No. 4 Hong Kong Road. All supervisory committee members Pan Xulun, Bei Zuyi, Chen Peide, Lu Jianai, and Wang Zhisheng were present, as was Executive Director Chu Fucheng. The resolutions were: (1) Recently, all sectors of society have had many questions about the donations received by various institutions in this port. This association is also one of the institutions receiving donations in this port. Can the supervisory committee telegraph the government in its name to request that personnel be sent immediately to conduct a thorough investigation to clarify the truth? The resolution was passed, and telegrams were sent to the Executive Yuan, the Control Yuan, and the Military Affairs Commission. (2) (Omitted) The meeting adjourned after the discussion. The telegram from the supervisory committee to the government is recorded below: "To the Nanjing National Government, the President of the Executive Yuan, the President of the Control Yuan, and the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission: This association was organized and established after the September 18th Incident, with the main purpose of raising funds to support the Northeast Anti-Japanese Army. In the past two years, the amount of receipts and expenditures has reached more than 530,000 yuan. The committee members are in charge of supervision and are responsible for reviewing the receipts and expenditures of the association and publishing them on schedule. The results of the review show that there is nothing incorrect. However, recently, suspicions have suddenly arisen in Shanghai regarding national salvation donations, causing the general public to indiscriminately speculate. Since this association is one of the organizations handling anti-Japanese donations, it should strive for transparency to establish credibility. Although there is a National Salvation Donation Investigation Committee in Shanghai, newspaper commentary also suggests that the organizations that make up the investigation committee are mostly organizations that participated in the organization of the relief associations in the past. Therefore, this investigation work should be presided over by the government. In order to express absolute transparency, this supervisory committee telegraphed the government yesterday, requesting that a senior official be sent to the association to audit the accounts and announce the results. The resolutions are recorded on file. Accordingly, we telegraphically request that the director general send personnel to the association as soon as possible to audit the accounts and announce the results in order to maintain social credit and guide national salvation work. We await your orders."</p>
<h3 id="e98">The City's Financial Situation in the Twenty-First Year <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>This Year's Tax Revenue Increased</p>
<p>Can Cover Last Year's Deficit</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the general financial situation of the city in the twenty-first year, according to statistics from the Municipal Finance Bureau, shows that the total revenue from various taxes and donations was more than 8.7 million yuan, and the expenditure for various expenses was more than 9.7 million yuan. This has been reported in various newspapers. According to a spokesperson for the Finance Bureau, the city's various industries have been declining due to the impact of the war, and tax revenue has decreased significantly. Despite the bureau's efforts to rectify the situation, revenue still falls short of expenditure. The settlement for the twenty-first year shows a deficit of more than 500,000 yuan. However, it is expected that this year's tax revenue will increase, and various new taxes are also under strict planning. Therefore, it is hoped that the deficit from the previous year can be made up. As for the Reconstruction Public Bonds previously issued by the municipal government, they were entirely used for disaster relief and reconstruction projects and were not diverted for other purposes. The detailed amounts of its income and expenditure have now been investigated and are compared with those of the twentieth year as follows: Summary of Income Part Twenty-first Year Income and Expenditure Twentieth Year Income and Expenditure Comparison Increase or Decrease Yuan Yuan Yuan</p>

<p>Provided a detailed explanation of each point in Li's inquiry</p>
<p>Stating that for anything heard, it is hoped to investigate the facts in detail</p>
<p>General Li Du sent another telegram to General Zhu Qinglan on the 14th, inquiring about the use of the anti-Japanese donations and listing various points to clarify the doubts. Zhu replied to Li via telegram yesterday, explaining the facts of each point raised by Li. The two telegrams are recorded separately below:</p>
<h3 id="e100">General Li's Telegram <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>General Li Du sent a fast telegram from Lushan on the 14th to General Zhu Qinglan. The original telegram stated: "Zhu Ziqiao, Shanghai, with respect, I recently received your telegram inquiring about the conversation reported in the newspaper. There was indeed a conversation, but when it was said that you, sir, used 500,000 yuan in donations to open a bank and run a school, it was probably a mishearing by the reporter, resulting in erroneous publication. The receipt of donations of 40,000 to 60,000 yuan refers to those in Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai who borrowed the name solely for propaganda, not those who actually resisted the Japanese. It is also not the case that Du's department received and distributed the funds in this way, which is heard with great certainty. However, who presided over this matter, and to whom did the remaining funds go, may not be known to you, sir. In short, there have been many doubts about you, sir, in the past year. Now that I have received your inquiry, I am making a straightforward statement. If you used 500,000 yuan in donations to open a bank in Rehe, you, sir, once said that you were adjusting the financial situation of Rehe Province. It is heard that the central government allocated 400,000 yuan to aid the anti-Japanese armies in the Northeast, and you, sir, sent a batch to Tang Yulin to manufacture 40,000 sets of leather military uniforms and transport them to Rehe, and purchased guns and cannons worth more than 800,000 yuan, storing them in Beiping. The central government issued 6 million rounds of ammunition to supplement the anti-Japanese forces, but it was discovered in Tianjin that your people were privately selling ammunition, and many were arrested and are still in custody. Yang Binlou and Gao Bosheng went to the Northeast on your orders to contact various military units. Since the incident, many people in Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai have been borrowing names solely for propaganda and have received more consolation money, while those who actually resist the Japanese have not benefited. I ask, who should be held responsible? The Jilin army launched an uprising in December of the 20th year and continued until January of this year, lasting thirteen months and engaging in more than 120 battles of various sizes. There should have been six regular army brigades, which were later expanded to fourteen brigades, as well as seven detachments of people's volunteer army. Since the fierce battle of Binjiang, each soldier had no more than 200 rounds of ammunition. When they retreated to Muling and the nine counties along the border, which were extremely barren, raising provisions was still difficult, let alone paying salaries. Therefore, from March of last year until they withdrew from the country, a total of ten months, no salaries were paid to the entire officer corps. During the counterattacks on Harbin and Jilin in April and May, the soldiers faced artillery fire, slept in mud, and could not get a full meal all day long. The hardship was heartbreaking. When the Japanese invaders advanced on Boli and Baoqing in September, the late autumn weather was suddenly cold, and the soldiers were all in single clothes and worn shoes, sleeping in the severe frost and light snow at night. Five or six out of ten fell ill due to the cold. At that time, they received a telegram from Beiping saying that you, sir, had promised to raise 200,000 yuan for clothing expenses. After the good news, the entire army was excited. However, only 20,000 yuan was received by late winter, and everyone was disappointed. As a result, they were unable to prepare clothing, and three or four out of ten soldiers did not wear cotton-padded clothes. When the Japanese invaders launched a large-scale offensive at the end of the year, the soldiers were lying in trenches to defend against the enemy in the severe winter cold, and the number of people who froze to death exceeded the casualties in battle. In addition, ammunition was exhausted, and the enemy's armored vehicles advanced, but the soldiers were holding empty guns and were unable to stop them. This allowed the Japanese invaders to gain momentum and eventually withdraw from the country. The main reason was that they were forced into poverty. If you, sir, had fulfilled your previous promise and allocated the full amount, the morale would have been boosted and they would not have suffered such a defeat. The central government allocated ammunition to you, sir, but you did not replenish it. You also made a large number of military uniforms and purchased a large number of guns and cannons. This is why there are rumors that you, sir, were planning your own development. At that time, the troops fighting in the Northeast had no clothing and insufficient ammunition, but you, sir, did not pay attention to this. If you were determined to resist Japan and save the country, you would have provided some assistance to the troops fighting in the Northeast, so that they would not be so impoverished. Yang Junbinlou in Muling and Gao Junbosheng in Dongning claimed to be acting on your orders to contact various military units to form another organization. Anti-Japanese work is a national sacrifice, not a struggle for personal rights. They only knew to save the country and knew nothing else. Therefore, they never understood the intentions of Yang Jun, and the people's consolation donations hoped for by the entire Du's department became silent. At that time, they telegraphed to inquire whether Yang Jun was your representative, and later received a reply acknowledging it. Last winter, the difficulties had reached their extreme. Yang Jun witnessed the situation and repeatedly telegraphed to report the difficult situation, and said that there were more than 3 million yuan in savings in Shanghai, but you, sir, never replied a word. It is believed that you are clear about the real situation of the Jilin army's resistance against Japan. After the incident, many people in Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai fabricated facts and fraudulently claimed donations in the name of anti-Japanese propaganda, and even sold ammunition. It is known that you, sir, would certainly not do this. However, if you do not use this to supplement the fighting troops and allow others to deceive you, and say that you have been deceived by others, what else can be said? As for opening a bank in the name of adjusting the financial situation in Rehe and sending Gao to manage it, the people's hard-earned donations were originally intended to comfort the volunteer army, but now they are used to open a bank, which is a great violation of the original intention of the donations. You also provided a large amount of funds to Tang Yulin. At that time, there was no war in Rehe, and Tang did not send a single soldier to aid the anti-Japanese resistance in the Northeast for more than a year. When the Japanese invaders invaded Rehe, he abandoned the entire province of Rehe in just a few days. To send a large amount of funds to Tang Yulin, who retreated without a fight, instead of aiding the Northeast Army, which was actually resisting the Japanese, is truly incomprehensible. Du's department received 40,000 yuan in consolation money from you, sir, before and after. The receipt stated 'Chairman Zhu's reward.' At that time, it was thought that it was your personal money, and the soldiers were praised for their kindness. However, after arriving in Shanghai, it was learned that it was donated by compatriots at home and abroad and entrusted to you, sir, for distribution. This is just a small part of it. The above items are either based on solid evidence or heard from others, and are not fabricated by Du. In recent years, there have been famines and wars, and you, sir, have been running around to provide relief. Your kindness and compassion have won the trust of the people. I admire you in private and am filled with admiration. How dare I tarnish your reputation with greedy and stingy actions? However, what people are privately discussing, Du will speak out plainly to resolve doubts and use it as a straightforward statement. Because of my deep love, I do not realize that my words are earnest. You, sir, are appealing in the mainland, while Du is fighting on the frontier, both serving the country, with no personal opinions in between. I am now replying to your previous telegram. Li Du bows with coldness."</p>
<h3 id="e101">Zhu Yuqiao's Reply Telegram <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Zhu Qinglan received Li Du's cold telegram late the day before yesterday, and replied to Li via telegram yesterday, explaining the facts of each question raised by Li. The original telegram is as follows: "Mr. Li Zhichu, with respect, I received your fast telegram at 11:30 PM on the 16th of this month and read it in full. I appreciate your indication that there was indeed a conversation with the newspaper, but the statement that Qinglan used 500,000 yuan in donations to run a school was a mishearing by the reporter. Also, the statement that a receipt for 10,000 yuan was issued but only 6,000 yuan was received refers to those in Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai who borrowed the name solely for propaganda, not that Du's department received the funds in this way. It seems that the content of your conversation published in the Jingbao on the 8th is completely untrue. It can be seen that hearsay is not to be easily believed. Your telegram said, 'Because of my deep love, my words are earnest,' which I greatly appreciate. I only regret that you, sir, have had repeated talks in Shanghai, but have never inquired about this, so that Qinglan could tell you the facts. Now that you have gone to Lushan, you are expressing your opinions through newspapers and telegrams, resulting in repeated errors or incomplete statements, which I deeply regret. Now, I will reply to each section raised in your telegram separately: (1) Your telegram said, '500,000 yuan in donations were used to open a bank in Rehe.' After investigation, this section is not true at all and is completely a misunderstanding. The reason for the misunderstanding is probably because the exchange rates in Rehe were stagnant last winter, and the original paper money of the Xingye Bank fluctuated constantly, causing financial chaos. The cash aid received by the volunteer armies on the Rehe border was difficult to exchange and use. If this problem was not resolved, there could be internal unrest in Rehe at any time without the enemy attacking. Qinglan once asked Minister Song and the central government, as well as the China and Jiaotong Banks, to set up branches in Rehe to provide relief. After consultation, it was decided to have the Fuli Bank go to add branches and fulfill the obligation of exchange and turnover. The establishment of this bank was long before ten years ago and had nothing to do with Qinglan. The establishment of branches by this bank has nothing to do with the donations. There are facts to investigate. (2) Your telegram said, 'The central government allocated 400,000 yuan to aid the anti-Japanese armies in the Northeast, and you, sir, sent a batch to Tang Yulin to manufacture 40,000 sets of leather military uniforms and transport them to Rehe.' After investigation, this section is even more untrue. Qinglan has never sent any funds to Tang to manufacture leather military uniforms. All funds from the central government to aid the anti-Japanese armies in the Northeast have accounts and records to check. I do not know what the above statement is based on. (3) Your telegram said, 'Guns and cannons worth more than 800,000 yuan were purchased and stored in Beiping.' After investigation, this section is even more shocking to hear. 800,000 yuan is a huge amount. To use it to purchase a large number of guns and cannons, how could any private individual be able to handle its transportation and storage? Where did this statement come from? Please clearly indicate where it is stored in Beiping. (4) Your telegram said, 'It was discovered in Tianjin that people from the office of you sir were privately selling ammunition, and many were arrested and are still in custody.' After investigation, this section is almost incredibly ridiculous. Since they have been arrested and are still in custody, please provide the names of those arrested, where they are being held, and whether they are from Qinglan's office. (5) Your telegram said, 'Yang Binlou and Gao Bosheng went to the Northeast on your orders to contact various military units.' After investigation, this section does not match the facts. Yang Binlou returned to the Northeast last year on his own initiative to work in Shanghai and requested assistance. He was not sent by Qinglan. Therefore, Qinglan telegraphed back to you, sir, saying that he knew of such a person, but he was not Qinglan's representative. Otherwise, when he left, a certificate letter would have been issued. As for Gao Bosheng, I have never known him. (6) Your telegram said, 'Since the incident, many people in Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai have been borrowing the name of anti-Japanese resistance to engage in propaganda work and have received more consolation money, while those who actually resist the Japanese have not benefited. I ask, who should be held responsible?' Who are those who are borrowing the name? Where did they get more consolation money? Who are those who are actually resisting the Japanese? What kind of benefits should they receive? Please point out the facts, and the responsibility will be clear. (7) Your telegram said, 'The Jilin army was hungry and cold and transferred battles, and the expected clothing expenses of 200,000 yuan could not be obtained in full, resulting in defeat.' After investigation, your representative, Mr. Wang Ziyao, requested 200,000 yuan for clothing expenses last autumn. At that time, in addition to requesting the government to provide assistance, I repeatedly appealed to the society and introduced your representative to contact various circles. As a result, only 20,000 yuan was raised in Shanghai and remitted. The fact that this was the process can be confirmed by letters and telegrams. Qinglan sincerely apologizes for not being able to provide widespread assistance to the anti-Japanese armies in the Northeast. But Qinglan has done his best, and what cannot be done is limited to Qinglan's ability. Those who are understanding should be able to understand this. (8) Your telegram said, 'The central government allocated ammunition to you, sir, but you did not replenish it. You also made a large number of military uniforms and purchased a large number of guns and cannons. This is why there are rumors that you, sir, were planning your own development.' After investigation, the central government has never had ammunition delivered to Qinglan to be designated for transfer to your department. Moreover, your department is far away in Sanxing, in an isolated area, making it impossible to transport. As for the military uniforms made by Qinglan, they were all worn by officers and soldiers of the Jilin, Heilongjiang, and returned to Rehe volunteer armies. Otherwise, they would not have been able to survive the cold winter and spring. The statement about purchasing a large number of guns and cannons has been answered in detail in the third section. Where did the statement about planning your own development come from? (9) Your telegram said, 'Your department received 40,000 yuan in consolation money from Qinglan before and after. The receipt stated "Chairman Zhu's reward".' After investigation, all the funds that Qinglan gave to your department were received by your representative Wang Ziyao (named Zhirong). The receipts are available and there has never been a so-called payment slip with the words 'Chairman Zhu's reward'. This can be thoroughly investigated. In short, you, sir, have just returned from overseas and may not be familiar with the past. You, sir, also know that donation income is collected sporadically, and no matter when, large amounts cannot be accumulated. How could there be a saying that there are more than 3 million yuan in savings in Shanghai? Moreover, there are many volunteer armies in various places, so how can the limited donations be able to provide universal and sufficient assistance? As the saying goes, 'A team of horses cannot catch the tongue.' It is hoped that you, sir, will investigate the facts in detail for anything heard. This is my sincere hope. Zhu Qinglan bows."</p>

<p>Has Never Managed the Income and Expenditure of National Salvation Donations</p>
<p>The Shanghai All Circles Investigation Committee for National Salvation Donations sent letters to various public organizations in Shanghai that handled national salvation donations, requesting them to submit all account books and receipts by the 23rd of this month for investigation. This has been reported in this newspaper. It is now known that the Shanghai Local Association has also received the above letter. The association immediately stated that since its establishment in June of last year, it has never managed the income and expenditure of national salvation donations and has replied to this effect in order to make the real situation clear to all circles.</p>

<p>The Review Committee Announced that the Minor Details of the Report Are on File for Review</p>
<p>The Shanghai All Circles Investigation Committee for National Salvation Donations, due to the discovery of corruption in the anti-Japanese donations, sent a letter yesterday requesting the courts to report and notified the donors, fundraising organizations, and recipients of funds to immediately report to the committee for verification. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Requesting the Courts to Report The committee sent a letter yesterday requesting the procuratorates of various courts to report. The original letter stated, "Dear Sirs, Recently, newspapers have been spreading rumors about the embezzlement of anti-Japanese national salvation donations. Your offices are responsible for inspection, and for this case, you should, regardless of whether it is based on rumors, automatically investigate and report based on your duties. However, it has been two weeks since the matter, and we have not yet seen any indication from your office, which is deeply surprising. General Li Du has now publicly stated that Mr. Zhu Qinglan has committed serious corruption in the anti-Japanese national salvation donations. Upon hearing this, we were even more shocked. We hereby formally request your office to report Mr. Zhu Qinglan and seal and safeguard all income and expenditure account books and receipts of the anti-Japanese national salvation donations that he has handled, and warn Mr. Zhu not to leave Shanghai without authorization before the case has been fully investigated, so as to facilitate the investigation and clarify the truth. This has been decided at the third committee meeting of our association. We hereby send this letter and hope that you will investigate and handle it and reply to us. Respectfully, To the Shanghai District Court, Shanghai First Special District Court, Shanghai Second Special District Court, Procuratorate."</p>
<p>Announcement by the Review Committee The Specialist Review Committee of the association announced yesterday to all donors, fundraising organizations, and remittance organizations that if they have received donation funds, they should report to the committee. The original text stated, "The Shanghai All Circles Investigation Committee for National Salvation Donations has approved the organization of a specialist review committee at the third committee meeting to facilitate the review work, and nominated Xi Yushu, Lu Zhaozuo, Pan Qizhang, Xie Lin, Qin Kai, Jiang Wanfeng, Yu Xizhi, Li Wenjie, and Xia Sunhuan as members of the specialist review committee. He Yuanming and Wang Haifan, the heads of the review section, are ex officio members, etc. This national salvation donation is a righteous act of our countrymen. Since the society has doubts about the amount and purpose, the members of this committee, who are also accountants, have been entrusted with the task of detailed review to clarify the truth. However, review requires accounts and evidence in order to be effective. Therefore, we are publishing this announcement. Donors of national salvation donations are requested to report the amount donated at that time, where the funds were handed over, and what receipts were obtained. If the funds were directly remitted to the recipient of the donation, please report which bank or firm remitted the funds, to whom and where they were remitted, and what receipts were obtained, so that we can verify them. Fundraising organizations are requested to report the name and amount of the donation, which bank or firm remitted the funds, to whom and where they were remitted, and what receipts were obtained, and send a list to this committee. If a credit record has been published, please also send it. If donation expenses are paid out of the donations, please include them. Remittance organizations are requested to report the amount of national salvation donations remitted, where the funds were entrusted to be remitted, to whom they were remitted, and what receipts were obtained, so that this committee can verify them. Recipients of donations are requested to report the amount of donations actually received, from which place and fundraising organization they were remitted, and which bank or firm they were received from, so that this committee can verify them. Furthermore, we welcome any opinions from the people regarding the review methods. This announcement is hereby made. The Specialist Review Committee.

<h3 id="e110">Chairman's Report <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>The conference nominated Ke Chang, Lu Keming, and Shui Xiangyun as the presidium. After performing the rituals, Chairman Zhang Kechang first reported the purpose of the meeting, stating that today's meeting has two meanings: one is the oath-taking of the 11th Executive and Supervisory Committees, and the other is the celebration of the 8th anniversary of the union's founding. Recalling this day eight years ago, postal workers felt unfair treatment and suffered various oppressions and pains, so they united to seek their own liberation. After the first major strike, the Postal Workers' Union was declared established. We have observed that the past ten committees have been able to devote themselves to union affairs with a spirit of sacrifice, and as a result of the support and supervision of all members, the union's current situation has been created. The current Executive and Supervisory Committees, at the beginning of their term, should bear the heavy responsibility entrusted by the members, uphold the spirit of practicality, diligence, and hard work, and strive to achieve the essence of the inaugural declaration of this term. We are willing to work together with all members. After the report, all Executive and Supervisory Committee members recited the oath. Then, Tao Baichuan, representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters, delivered a training speech, and Wang Xiaolai of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce delivered a speech. Next, Xie Baochen of the Postal Administration, Jaffe Lin and Dai Baohua of the Shanghai Postal Administration, Ye Xianggao of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, Lu Jingshi of the National Postal Workers' General Union, and guests such as Ren Jinping delivered speeches successively, with the speeches omitted for brevity.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Photo Session and Adjournment, Union Declaration <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>After the guests finished their speeches, Chairman Lu Keming delivered a closing speech. Everyone stood up and shouted slogans, then took a group photo and adjourned the meeting. After the meeting, representatives from all walks of life visited the union's office and club, where they were received by all members and treated with refreshments.</p>
<p>The declaration of the 11th Executive and Supervisory Committees of the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union states: Time passes easily, and years flow like water. The 11th Executive and Supervisory Committees of this union now take office after the previous term. Reflecting on the past ten terms, their work has been gradual and meticulous. Whether for the country, society, the postal service, or postal workers, they have never considered themselves successful. However, the past achievements are undeniable. Therefore, looking back on the past and planning for the future, we hereby declare the future mission of this union on the day of our inauguration. Today, the country is in dire straits, and the world is changing rapidly. The country's hope is almost exhausted, and the country's peril and the shrinking of its territory should be deeply felt by all compatriots living today, and we should remember the danger while living in peace. Our postal workers have always taken serving the country and society as a prerequisite, and will continue to do so in the future. Feeling the current difficulties and deeply moved, we should be more encouraged to rise up and move forward bravely. Anything that benefits the country and society should be fought for together with our compatriots from all walks of life, and we will not hesitate to go through fire and water. This is the first point. The decline of the postal service in recent years has become an unprecedented phenomenon in the more than 30 years since the postal service was established. Our postal workers serve the postal service and are closely connected to it. How can we not feel sad when we see this situation? We have often studied the rights and wrongs, gains and losses, and the reasons for this situation. Although there are many reasons, the exhaustion of the postal service's economy and the decline of its business are the biggest fatal wounds. Therefore, today, to talk about the development of the postal service, the first thing is to stabilize the postal service's economy and restore its business. Our postal workers, as people who dedicate themselves to the postal service, sincerely hope to cooperate with the authorities with their love for the postal service. As for ourselves, we should work hard and impartially to improve work efficiency. This is the second point. Since its establishment, this union has experienced many difficulties. We deeply feel that the reason why this union has a long and glorious history today is due to the unity and support of all members on the one hand, and the completeness of the union's organization and the strictness of its discipline on the other hand. This enables all bad forces to have no opportunity to enter. Therefore, in order to maintain our hard-won union and its glorious history, we must strive for perfection and be more meticulous. We must not be satisfied with the past achievements, but take a step further to make this union militarized in terms of organization and discipline. In other words, all members, in addition to strictly abiding by the union's discipline, should absolutely obey the union's orders. In this way, the steps will be neat, the union's strength will be enriched, and the union's foundation will be more solid. This is the third point. The establishment of this union, internally, its greatest purpose is to gather the wisdom and strength of the masses to seek the welfare of the members, and to pay special attention to adapting to the needs of the members in all internal constructions. In recent years, the energy spent on this has been seen by all. Although it has experienced the changes of the January 28th Incident and was almost completely destroyed, the efforts of the previous Executive and Supervisory Committees and the supervision of all members have restored the inherent construction and improved it in a short time. From now on, we should follow this principle, not make empty words, pay attention to practice, and strive to achieve the realization of all constructions in the union. Moreover, we should organize a design committee to plan, weigh the urgency, and use a portion of the financial resources to run a portion of the business, so that all members can enjoy their due rights. This is the fourth point. Summarizing these four points is the entire mission of this union from now on. Based on the previous efforts, we will bury our heads in hard work and hereby declare this. Shanghai Postal Workers' Union, August 17, 1933.</p>

<p>The Deceased, Shi Xuanqiu, Had Just Moved from Hongkou to Shanzhong Road</p>
<p>Killed by a Korean in Fancy Clothes Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>丨Some Say It Was a Political Act, the French Police Are Taking It Very Seriously丨</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at around 6:00 a.m., a Korean youth was suddenly assassinated inside Lane 1270, No. 26, at the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Shanzhong Road in the French Concession. The assailant fired a total of three shots, all hitting the youth's vital parts, killing him on the spot. The details are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Inside Korean Village <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>There are many Korean residents living in Lane 1270 near the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Shanzhong Road in the French Concession, which has become a special area for Korean residents, so the neighbors call it Korean Village. At the end of the lane is a one-story small western-style house, No. 26, whose landlord is also Korean, named Lin Haishan, a pen merchant, who lives upstairs. The downstairs living room is sublet to two Korean women, both of whom are young and attractive.</p>
<h3 id="e117">A Solitary Person <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>At the beginning of this month, Lin and his wife went to Beijing together, and their residence in Shanghai was entrusted to their relative Jin Ji to manage. At the same time, the remaining back room upstairs was sublet to a Korean youth named Shi Xuanqiu. Shi's original home was in Hamhung, Korea, and he is now 37 years old. He is a Korean ginseng merchant. He has only been in the house for a week. He has no family and few friends. He goes out early and returns late alone, which is his usual habit. He used to live in Hongkou for a long time, but for some reason, he recently moved to Avenue Joffre.</p>

<p>At around 6:45 yesterday morning, after Shi got up, he was washing in the upstairs kitchen when a young man came, dressed in Chinese clothes and speaking Korean. When he saw Shi, he whispered to him. After Shi finished washing and went upstairs, the young man followed him. As soon as Shi entered the room, the young man took out a pistol from his sleeve and fired three shots at Shi. Shi fell to the ground in response, and the assailant turned around and escaped through the back door, disappearing in an instant.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Three Wounds <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>At that time, the cohabitants suddenly heard continuous gunshots upstairs and were all awakened, but to prevent accidents, they did not dare to open the door to check. After more than ten minutes, they opened the door to check and saw that Shi had fallen in a pool of blood. They touched him and found that he had already died. They reported it to the French police, and the police chief immediately sent Chinese and Western detectives to rush to the scene. After an inspection, they found that Shi had been shot three times, in the head, chest, and waist, and all of them were penetrating wounds.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Speculation on the Cause of Death <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>After the detectives finished their investigation, they collected three shell casings and the bullets that had penetrated the body and took them to the police station for investigation. Because the deceased was Korean, the police notified the Japanese consulate to send someone to the scene to take the body away for examination. However, according to general speculation, the reason for Shi's death was more likely a political act. However, the French Concession police authorities, seeing that Korean assassinations have occurred repeatedly recently, with the second one occurring just ten days after the recent killing of Yu Hui Guan, are taking it very seriously. It is said that they are planning to formulate measures to maintain order in the concession.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Yu Tianbi and Others Suggest That the Three Major Companies Open Special Departments for National Products <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>A Good Sign of the National Goods Year</p>
<p>Our country's production has declined, industry and commerce are sluggish, and people are accustomed to using foreign goods. To encourage the improvement of domestic goods and arouse the public's awareness, it is necessary to display, guide, and promote them. It is reported that Mr. Yu Tianbi, the former director of the Municipal National Goods Exhibition Hall, has seen this and suggested that the Nanjing Road Sincere, Wing On, and Sun Sun department stores open special departments for national goods to promote identification and encourage their use. The text of Mr. Yu's letter to the Shanghai Joint Association of Machine-Made National Goods Factories is recorded below. It begins: Today, all people of insight regard enriching national power and cultivating people's strength as the most urgent tasks. However, there is no other way to enrich and cultivate than to revitalize industry and promote national goods. Recently, various national goods manufacturers have been aware of this and have been able to work hard and devote themselves to saving the country in their respective positions. All of these situations can be said to be a good sign for the future of industry. However, when national goods are just budding, special attention should be paid to promotion to avoid stagnation. Although there are several national goods stores in this city, they are still too few considering the wide area of Shanghai, and their appeal is far less than that of the Sincere, Sun Sun, and Wing On department stores on Nanjing Road. Therefore, to achieve the smooth sale of national goods, it seems appropriate for manufacturers to jointly request that the department stores open special departments for national goods to achieve greater results. When Tianbi took office as the director of the Municipal National Goods Exhibition Hall last year, he had the intention to handle this matter. However, because his term of office was very short, he could not accomplish it. He then drafted a plan and suggested it to the Shanghai National Goods Promotion Association. Although it was reported in the newspapers and a reply was received that it had been adopted, it has not been implemented for many days, and this is a matter of concern. Therefore, based on his long-standing aspiration to serve society, he has raised the old matter again. He hopes that all national goods manufacturers will clearly understand the importance of joint sales and not be satisfied with the existence of several national goods stores, and will work together to achieve this goal. I hope you will consider my humble opinion. (The following is omitted.) The letter to the three major companies has the same general meaning and is omitted.</p>
<h3 id="e122">China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Anti-Theft Measures for Ocean Liners Are Strict <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Iron Railings Installed, Firearms Added</p>
<p>Passengers Are Inspected Upon Boarding</p>
<p>There have been more cases of pirate attacks on ships this year than in any other year. After the Yu Shun incident of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the meeting on anti-theft on merchant ships convened by the Ministry of Communications agreed on measures that are being drafted and will be implemented soon. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's effective anti-theft measures began yesterday. The relevant information is reported below.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Ocean Liner Equipment Completed <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's anti-theft measures were already underway before the Yu Shun incident, including installing iron railings, isolating the watchtower, building a silver vault, acquiring more rifles and pistols, and adding a machine gun. In addition, more escort police teams were added to each ship, and the "Xin Ming," "Xin Feng," "Hai Yan," "Pu An," and "Tai Shun" ships were designated, costing a total of more than 30,000 yuan. Now, since the Yu Shun incident, the anti-theft work on each ocean liner has been carried out more actively. Except for the machine gun, which is still being applied for, the remaining arrangements have been completed successively. Passengers can now travel without worry.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Eight Russian Police Officers Assigned <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>There is a Russian police team of ten people in the bureau, originally prepared for temporary emergency needs and dispatched for escort. Recently, it has been noted that pirates are mixing in everywhere in Dapeng Bay, taking advantage of the opportunity to rob ships. Eight or nine out of ten of these pirates disguise themselves as passengers to board the ship and then rob it in the middle of the journey, which is really difficult to prevent. Recently, there have been frequent alarms in the Shanghai shipping industry. In order to prepare for unforeseen circumstances and prevent them in advance, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has added an inspection team starting yesterday, specializing in searching passengers on each ship to prevent pirates from mixing in. Eight Russian police officers have been assigned to be responsible for the inspection.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Inspection Began Yesterday <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>The Russian police's inspection of passengers began yesterday. It is temporarily limited to ocean liners. Regardless of whether it is the Tianjin, Wenzhou, Fuzhou, Ningbo, or Shantou, Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Xiamen liners, before the ship sails, when the passengers are all on board, the eight Russian police officers will board the ship with weapons. They will first search each passenger's luggage. Also, learning from the loss of the Yu Shun, the passengers' bodies will also be searched to prevent them from carrying weapons. First, second, and third class passengers must be searched, but special attention will be paid to steerage passengers. Yesterday, the Shanghai-Ningbo and Wenzhou liners were searched when they set sail. Even if there are pirates in the future, it will not be easy for them to mix in.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Plans to Follow Suit in Other Ports <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>The bureau also believes that when each ocean liner sails from various ports in the north and south oceans back to Shanghai, there are also passengers. If only export ships are searched, it is not a fundamental solution to prevent bandits. Therefore, it has been decided that each imported ship will also be searched. When ships depart from other ports, branch bureaus in each port will be telegraphed to implement searches for passengers disembarking at the local station, following the Shanghai bureau's methods. If any suspicious persons are found or weapons are confiscated, the passengers will be detained and handed over to the local military and police agencies for interrogation. As for the Yangtze River ships, because there are escorting soldiers, and river ships are not valued by bandits, because even if they rob, there is no place to escape, so each river ship will not be searched.</p>
<h3 id="e127">British Shipowner Dies Tragically <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Stabbed to Death by a British-Russian Woman</p>
<p>The Da Mei Evening News reports that last night (16th) at around 11:00 p.m., Yang Si, a British shipowner, was seriously injured in a fight at his residence at No. 17, Lane 166, Maohai Road, and died in the ambulance on the way to the hospital. Yang's death is believed to have been caused by a fight with Mrs. Hartley, a British-Russian woman, who stabbed him with a knife. Mrs. Hartley was also stabbed in the chest, but the injury was minor. Yang was stabbed twice, and the wound on his right neck bled non-stop, leading to his death. Earlier, at around 10:10 p.m., the police received a phone call from his neighbor, reporting that he had seen the injured in a fight through the window. The police were dispatched, but no one answered the door. The police broke down the door and entered the room, and the police were almost tripped by Yang's body. Yang was lying in a pool of blood, and fresh blood was still gushing out from his neck. The police first tried to stop the bleeding and called an ambulance to take him to the General Hospital, but he died on the way due to excessive bleeding. The police later found Mrs. Hartley in the neighboring room, who was distraught and exhausted. It is believed that she was involved in the fight, and the wound on her chest was also bleeding non-stop. She was immediately taken to the General Hospital for treatment and then taken to the Tilanqiao police station for questioning. However, because she was mentally disturbed, the police could not find out what happened that night. According to what was heard this morning (17th), it is only known that she is a widow, 36 years old, and obtained British nationality in 1919. This morning at 11:30 a.m., the British police court sent someone to examine the body and then opened a court session at 2:30 p.m. After the judge read the charges, he said to the Russian woman, "I don't need to ask you whether you plead guilty or not, because I must send you to the Great Hall for trial." It is also heard that Yang had rented the house not long ago and bought a lot of furniture this week, which shows that he did not expect the danger of death to come before it happened.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Court Had Not Yet Approved Arrest Warrant, Lawyer Had Already Published Announcement <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>丨Containing the Phrase "Approved by the Court for Arrest"丨</p>
<p>Lawyer Yuan Xilian and Lin Zhongwen Are Jointly Sued</p>
<p>Chen Kan Accuses the Two of Joint Defamation and Claims Damages</p>
<p>Lawyer Yuan Xilian, as the representative of Lin Zhongwen, filed a case against Chen Kan, a Fujianese, in the Second Special District Local Court. Chen repeatedly failed to appear in court despite being summoned. Subsequently, Lawyer Yuan, on behalf of his client, published an arrest warrant in the newspaper. The arrest warrant contained the phrase "Approved by the Court for Arrest." Chen Kan read it and investigated with the Second Special Court. He found that at the time the advertisement was published, the court had not yet approved the application, and it was actually Yuan and Lin Zhongwen who fabricated the statement and published it in the newspaper. Therefore, he hired a lawyer to sue Yuan and Lin in the First Special District Local Court, requesting that the defendants be convicted of joint defamation and be ordered to compensate for reputational damages of 14,000 yuan. The First Special Court has repeatedly opened court to hear the case, as reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Xue continued to hear the case. Only the defendant Yuan Xilian appeared in court. First, the plaintiff Chen Kan stated the reasons for the lawsuit in his Fujianese accent. Most of what he said was legal provisions and old and new precedents. He read aloud from the paper for a minute before stopping. Then, Yuan Xilian recounted the circumstances of handling the case, saying that Lin Zhongwen asked me to request an arrest in court on December 30 because Chen Kan had failed to appear in court twice. The judge verbally agreed that day. The next day, Lin came to inquire, and I told him that I had obtained permission. Lin then sent Chen's photo to the office. I then submitted a document with the photo to the Second Special District Local Court on January 4. On January 10, the case was again heard by the Second Special Court, and I again requested an arrest. The judge nodded again. The next day, Lin ordered his son to send the draft arrest warrant to the office. Because I had not yet seen the court's clear approval of the previous request for an arrest warrant, I instructed him to postpone the publication or change it to a warning. I stamped the draft and handed it back to his son, but I told him that if he wanted to publish this draft, he should wait for my notification. Unexpectedly, the newspaper had already been published on January 15, and I had no right to stop it. In short, lawyers handle cases with the client's intentions as their own, and all actions are naturally the responsibility of the client. However, the plaintiff is demanding that I compensate for damages of 14,000 yuan. I have no feud with Chen. It is purely that young people are being meddlesome and trying to show off, and so on. The court believed that the content of the case was already clear and did not need to be stated further. It ordered the lawyers of both parties to begin the final arguments and adjourned the court, announcing that the verdict would be announced on the 21st of this month.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Trial Opens for Wang Xiaomei's Lawsuit Against Zhang Shuliang for Sending a Small Coffin <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Shuliang Has a Gold Tooth on His Upper Jaw</p>
<p>Coffin Shop Apprentice Identifies Him in Court</p>
<p>Trial Postponed to the 24th of This Month</p>
<p>Wang Xiaomei, a 19-year-old dance hostess at the Greater Shanghai Ballroom, resides at No. 6, Siming Lane, Xiafei Road. Recently, some dance patrons dissatisfied with her have often resorted to mischievous means, such as sending lavish meals for no reason or unexpectedly ordering a relocation truck to move her things. On the 23rd of last month, Wang was driving around when Car No. 92 followed her. On Yu Garden Road, it rammed into her bumper. Although there was no damage, it already broke her heart. Although Wang encountered the aforementioned incidents, she still tolerated it and kept silent. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the 26th of last month at 11 o'clock, someone suddenly sent a small coffin to her home. According to national customs, a coffin entering the door is a sign of major misfortune. At this point, Wang Xiaomei could no longer bear it and immediately reported it to the police. At the time, there was no way to find the instigator, so they had to withdraw. However, when they questioned the apprentice who delivered it, named Zhang Guisheng, he said that if he encountered this person again, he would still be able to recognize him. Later, Wang Xiaomei thought carefully about the pranksters and concluded that they must be dance patrons who were dissatisfied with her. Therefore, during the tea dance at the Greater Shanghai Ballroom on the 30th of last month, she and Zhang Guisheng identified Zhang Shuliang, a native of Suzhou, 30 years old, and an employee of Jardine Matheson, among the dance patrons. As soon as Zhang Guisheng saw him, he identified him as the person who bought the coffin that day. However, Zhang Shuliang stated that this was not the case. As a result of the dispute between the two parties, they ended up at the Xinzha Police Station. After the head of the station investigated, he ordered them to file a lawsuit with the court. Wang Xiaomei then hired lawyer Wu Peng and filed a complaint with the First Special District Court, accusing Zhang of insult. Yesterday afternoon was the date for the trial. Judge Wu Xiangzu presided over the questioning in the First Criminal Court. Because the details of the dispute between the two parties had already been published in the newspaper yesterday, the audience was very crowded. According to Wang Xiaomei's testimony, on the evening of the 23rd of last month, when she was driving around, a Mr. Zhou, together with Zhang, drove Car No. 92 and followed her. On Yu Garden Road, they intentionally made things difficult for her by hitting her bumper with their car, but there was no damage. The reason was that Mr. Zhou had accumulated hatred with me. At 11 o'clock in the morning on the 26th, an old craftsman and an apprentice from a coffin shop delivered a small coffin, claiming that it was purchased by my family. Because the visitor intended to insult me, I reported it to the police. Later, when I questioned the apprentice, I learned that someone else had instructed him to deliver it and that he could remember his clothing and special features. Therefore, later at the ballroom, he pointed out Zhang Shuliang. However, I did not know Zhang before. Usually, Zhang and a Mr. Zhou came to the ballroom together. The reason was that Mr. Zhou did not buy a ticket and wanted to go out with me, but I refused, which led to a feud, and so on. Next, according to Zhang Shuliang's testimony, he did not know Wang Xiaomei before. As for the evening of the 23rd, I was already asleep at home and did not go out driving. As for the delivery of the coffin on the 26th, I was handling matters at work at the time and did not go out either, and so on. Then, according to the witness Zhang Guisheng's testimony, he is 16 years old and lives at No. 15, Dali, Kaizi Road. He is an apprentice at the Xuchangxing Coffin Shop. At around 10 o'clock on the 26th, two people came to buy a small coffin and contacted my supervisor. At the time, the asking price was 3 yuan and 2 jiao, but the two people bargained down to 2 yuan and 5 jiao and ordered it to be delivered to No. 6, Siming Lane. On the spot, they personally wrote the address on a cigarette pack with a pencil. Then I accompanied the old supervisor to deliver it. One of the two people was wearing a light blue long gown and had a gold tooth on his upper right jaw. At this point, Judge Wu immediately ordered Zhang Shuliang to write "No. 5634, Wang Chuli's Residence" and other numbers in court and ordered him to open his mouth to examine the position and number of gold teeth he had, which were the same as those described by Zhang Guisheng. Because this case still requires the testimony of witnesses, he immediately ordered a postponement until 2 PM on the 24th of this month for the continuation of the trial. The defendant, Zhang Shuliang, was released on bail pending appearance.</p>

<p>Since its establishment, the City National Goods Exhibition Hall has been responsible for organizing all past National Goods Exhibition Conferences. Last year's National Goods Exhibition was especially expanded, and due to the urgency of the time, the preparations were extremely heavy and strenuous. The National Goods Exhibition to be held this year will inevitably be further developed. The curator of the hall, Cao Zhendong, believes that the staff is small, the work is heavy, and he is deeply concerned about being unable to handle it. He has now submitted a petition to the Social Affairs Bureau to host this year's National Goods Exhibition, in order to show solemnity.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Employees of the Telecommunications Machinery Manufacturing Plant Petition Party and Government Organs <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>And Seek Assistance from Various Organizations</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications' Telecommunications Machinery Manufacturing Plant is now under orders from the Ministry to cease operations and is limited to closing by the end of this month. All employees will be given one month's salary as severance pay. However, all the technicians of the plant, because they are worried about their livelihoods after the plant closes, specially sent representatives to the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to petition yesterday morning, and issued a declaration, requesting assistance from all sectors.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Request for Assistance from All Sectors <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at 9 o'clock, the factory workers' representatives Shi Mingpan, Shi Longbao, Yan Zimu, Zhou Shunde, Shi Aquan, Gan Lin, Ye Junru, etc., went to the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to petition. The authorities sent personnel to receive them. The representatives then went to the National Telecommunications Workers' Association to request assistance. Their letter to the various associations requesting assistance stated: We, the technicians of the Ministry of Communications' Telecommunications Machinery Manufacturing Plant in Zhoujiadu, Pudong, respectfully report that we have suddenly received an order from the Ministry to cease operations due to "incomplete content" and to be dismissed by August 31st, etc. We have checked that the technicians have all been approved by the Ministry of Communications and have guarantees. Even if a technician makes a mistake, there are disciplinary regulations in the rules, and they cannot be dismissed without reason. As for the "incomplete content," there are those responsible, so how can it be blamed on the technicians? Most of the technicians have been practicing in the factory since they were young and have more than ten years of qualifications. Moreover, the skills they have learned are specialized in manufacturing various telecommunications machinery and various batteries, etc. Once they lose their jobs, there is nowhere to seek a livelihood. Moreover, the Ministry of Communications abruptly dismisses technicians halfway without reason, which is not in accordance with the law or regulations. Moreover, is the government currently providing relief to the unemployed? We have always admired your association's leadership of the people and engagement in construction. The technicians boldly submit this letter, earnestly requesting that you uphold justice and provide assistance.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Declaration of All Technicians <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>The factory workers issued a declaration stating: To the national telecommunications bureaus, telegraph bureaus, telephone bureaus, telecommunications organs, operators, technicians, mechanics, and various party and government organs, various labor unions, and various newspapers: We respectfully report that Director Yu Ruxin has recently issued a notice stating that according to the instructions of the Ministry of Communications, the content of this factory is "incomplete" and should be closed down immediately, completed within this month, in order to plan for improvement. All employees, except for telecommunications technicians and operators who should be transferred after the completion of the closure, should be dismissed and given one month's salary as severance pay, etc. This is a bolt from the blue, causing great consternation. We technicians are merely craftsmen and only know how to work on orders. If our skills are not good and we spoil the goods, causing losses to the factory, or if we intentionally sabotage or disobey orders, causing the director to be unable to exercise his duties, the director must distinguish between principals and accomplices and punish them accordingly. The four words "incomplete content" should not be applied to the technicians, causing us one hundred and several dozen technicians to lose our jobs and become beggars. But each person has a family, and one person's unemployment affects the whole family. In total, the lives of one thousand and several hundred people are at stake. Moreover, the responsibility for poor management lies with the director and has nothing to do with the technicians. How can the technicians be made to take responsibility for it, while the directly responsible director can take measures at his leisure, allowing the technicians to be slaughtered one by one? Moreover, most of the technicians have learned their skills in this factory and only know how to manufacture products for telegraph and telecommunications bureaus. They cannot undertake other work. In the Ministry of Communications, it is a specialized skill, and in society, it is discarded material. Apart from this, there is only a dead end. Just as operators only know how to send and receive telegrams and cannot take on other tasks, the Ministry of Communications has established operator regulations for the sake of protecting specialized skills, and they cannot be dismissed unless they violate the regulations. For us technicians, there are also special technician regulations. Now that the regulations have not been abolished, the technicians only know how to abide by the law. We especially request that all sectors uphold justice and provide assistance, and that the Ministry of Communications send personnel to rectify and resume work quickly, in order to maintain livelihoods and emphasize telecommunications. The technicians will certainly obey orders and follow instructions. We urgently submit this statement and await instructions with the utmost gratitude. Sincerely, all the technicians of the Ministry of Communications' Telecommunications Machinery Manufacturing Plant in Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Soy Sauce Extract Contains Arsenic Poison <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Ministry of Finance Advises Municipal Government to Investigate and Ban</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance, according to the report from the Songjiang Salt Transport Deputy Envoy, stated that privately manufactured soy sauce extract in the Chinese areas and concessions of Shanghai hinders hygiene and affects tax sales. It has ordered the bureaus and districts to investigate and seize them, and requested that it be forwarded to the Municipal Government for investigation and ban, along with a list of factory addresses. The Ministry believes that this soy sauce extract is not manufactured like the soy sauce sold by soy sauce shops, which uses official salt. According to the Deputy Envoy's investigation, it contains arsenic poison. If this is true, it not only violates the salt regulations, but also endangers public health. Yesterday, it especially advised the Municipal Government to send letters to the concession authorities and instruct its subordinate bureaus to investigate and ban it, in order to emphasize hygiene and maintain the salt law.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Representatives of the China Walking Corps Arrive in Shanghai <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>The China Walking Corps is organized by more than a dozen young people with ambition in Guangdong. They plan to walk across the country for ten years to investigate the living conditions of people in various parts of the country and the reform of social undertakings. They have been approved by the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, and the General Headquarters of the China Boy Scouts to issue travel permits. They departed from Guangdong in 1931 and have been walking for more than two years, covering a distance of more than 27,000 li. Their footprints have spread throughout the provinces of Fujian, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Henan, Guangxi, Sichuan, and other provinces. After the corps arrived in Sichuan, it was divided into the Kangzang Team and the Mongolian-Hui Team. The Kangzang Team has now reached western Xikang and is temporarily staying in Ba'an for investigation due to a shortage of travel expenses. The Mongolian-Hui Team circled from Sichuan through Qin and Jin to Hebei Province and is expected to leave the Great Wall soon, passing through Suiyuan, Ningxia, Gansu, Qinghai, Xinjiang, and joining the Kangzang Team, then going to Inner and Outer Mongolia and the northeastern provinces, and returning to the central provinces. The corps has exhausted its funds due to long journeys and has been robbed by bandits eight times, losing almost all of its luggage. The journey ahead is long and expensive, and it is deeply feared that economic difficulties will hinder progress.

Since its previous performance of "The Merchant of Venice", it has been silent for a long time. Recently, it has been planning a large-scale performance in mid-September.

<p>The Lung Association Gifts Methods for Preventing Lung Disease: The Chinese Lung Disease Association at 379-380 Datong Road in this city was initiated by Central Committee member Wu Zhihui, Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng, and Health Bureau Director Li Tingan. Its purpose is to specialize in the research and prevention of lung diseases and the elimination of their pathogens, so as to maintain the health and well-being of the entire society. Since its establishment, the number of members has been quite enthusiastic. Recently, the association has determined that although there are many lung disease patients in our country, few people have knowledge of lung disease. In order to prevent public illness and save those who are already ill, it is necessary to popularize lung disease knowledge first, and then all facilities related to lung disease can be easily promoted. Therefore, it has been decided to make efforts to compile and print various lung disease books and distribute them widely throughout the country in a short period of time. One that has already been published is "Methods for Treating Lung Disease," and now "Methods for Preventing Lung Disease" will continue to be published. Each type of request for reading requires a three-cent stamp, which is truly a common gospel for social health.</p>

<p>With Special Circumstances Exception</p>
<p>According to the Fujian Provincial Department of Education, Article 6 of the Education Association Law stipulates that the area of an education association shall be based on the existing administrative area, but this shall not apply if there are special circumstances in the district education association that have been approved by the supervisory authority. The Department of Education has issued instructions that the so-called special circumstances should be interpreted in accordance with the law and that the regulations are not explicitly stipulated. The instructions of the Ministry of Education state that the above-mentioned facts need to be examined in detail. The special circumstances referred to in the proviso to Article 6 of the Education Association Law must have obvious facts and sufficient reasons to prove that the district education association needs to have an area that does not conform to the existing administrative area to conform to the meaning of the four characters "special circumstances". For example, if the number of members in an administrative area is less than 20, or if administrative area A is too vast compared to administrative areas B and C, and education is particularly developed, etc.</p>

<p>The Municipal Education Bureau of this city, believing that some private middle schools in this city have adopted a dual-class system, which has led to abuses, instructed various middle schools yesterday to pay attention to correction. The original order stated: "The adoption of a dual-class system in primary schools is a last resort. The content of the middle school curriculum is complex, and guidance takes time. This type of system is not applicable. However, in recent years, private middle schools in this city have often adopted this type of system, only seeking to save school expenses, without considering the interests of students, which is extremely inappropriate. Recently, the Ministry of Education promulgated Article 21 of the Middle School Regulations, which states that 'All subjects in middle school, except physical education and military training, may adopt other grouping methods for teaching, but may not be taught in combined classes'. According to this regulation, all subjects in middle school should be taught in separate classes to emphasize academics and comply with the decree. From the 22nd year of the Republic of China, all private middle schools in this city must not adopt a dual-class system for teaching, so as to emphasize academics and comply with the decree."</p>

The audience was quite satisfied. Next, Shen Zhisan and Qian Xueming, directors of the health section of the center, and others performed a duet, crying about illiterate people using folk tunes to perform the role of Uncle Miaogen in a moving way, which was quite interesting. Finally, all the staff members of the center performed a costume speech, a play called "Abandoned by Everyone," which fully performed all kinds of oppression suffered by illiterate people, until the audience dispersed at around 1:00 PM.

<p>Jointly Researching and Separating Chemistry with Han Zukang</p>
<p>Xueyi Library Organized and Ready to Open</p>
<p>In order to promote the research of natural sciences, the Zhonghua Xueyi Society has recently jointly established a chemical research laboratory with member Han Zukang. In addition, the library of the society has now been organized and will soon be opened. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Chemical Research Laboratory: One large and one small room, Room 206 on the second floor of the society, is used by Mr. Han as a private laboratory for separating and analyzing chemicals. The discussion has been going on for a long time. Previously, the society's premises were borrowed for an exhibition of railway products, so it was delayed until now. The conditions have now been agreed upon by both parties. All rent is waived, and the installation of electricity, tap water, and gas pipes, etc., is borne by the society for a period of ten years. However, Mr. Han should publish at least two research papers each year in the Xueyi Magazine published by the society. The interior is currently being organized and will be opened soon.</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>Xueyi Library: Over the years, members of the society have deposited more than 10,000 books, including books in English, German, French, and Japanese, mostly in the fields of politics and economics. The society had originally asked Mr. Lü Shaozhen of the Library Department of Wuchang Wenhua University to come to Shanghai to organize the books in the summer of last year, with the intention of opening it last year, but it was stopped due to incomplete organization. This summer, Mr. Lü graduated from Wenhua and was re-hired by the society to come to Shanghai. After more than a month of preparation, all the categories have been compiled and can be opened soon.</p>

<p>The Shanghai University Students Joint Association has donated and contributed significantly to the cause of national salvation through aviation.

Since your association initiated the fundraising for aviation donations, all the university students in Shanghai have taken the lead as young pioneers, either enthusiastically donating or actively fundraising, amounting to a considerable sum, which can be easily verified. This semester, to further enhance the effectiveness of fundraising, we have jointly organized a committee across various schools to raise funds for a "Shanghai University Students Aircraft," planning steps and actively proceeding. Now, to promote the success of donations and encourage patriotic spirit, we propose that one of the aircraft purchased and arriving soon be designated as the "Shanghai University Students Aircraft." We would appreciate your response on this matter.</p>

<h3 id="e172">President of Shanghai College of Law and Politics Submits Petition to the Ministry of Education Requesting Approval to Rescind Order to Cease Enrollment <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai College of Law and Politics received an order from the Ministry of Education in July of this year to cease enrollment. The acting president of the college, Zhang Zhongdao, traveled to Beijing to personally meet with Minister Wang, presenting the difficulties faced. He also submitted a separate petition to the Ministry of Education requesting approval to rescind the order to cease enrollment. The submitted document is recorded below: Petition to clarify difficult circumstances, humbly requesting review and approval to rescind the order to uphold education and facilitate rectification. Regarding the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau's instruction No. 9616, which forwarded the Ministry's instruction No. 7020, ordering the college to cease enrolling new students and transfer students, to provide an opportunity for final rectification, etc. Upon receiving this, the college felt nothing but dismay. The Ministry's rectification of education naturally has its own standards, which the college need not reiterate. However, we believe that education is a grand plan for cultivating talent, and to achieve good education, it cannot be accomplished overnight. It requires time to allow for thorough implementation, so that progress can be made gradually and perfection can be approached step by step. Even among the current national universities, there are still areas that do not fully meet expectations, let alone private universities, whose finances rely solely on private individuals and whose measures often face obstacles. This situation is well known to experienced educators like yourselves. The college, mindful of its past history and future mission, has been diligently determined to implement the improvements outlined in the Ministry's instruction No. 1853 issued in March of this year. We have already reported on the progress and plans for improvement in April of this year, submitting them for your review and guidance. Among these, regarding academic matters such as student level, faculty compensation, curriculum arrangement, etc., and regarding general affairs such as equipment, campus, funding, etc., aside from a small portion that can be improved as much as possible in the shortest amount of time, other aspects such as raising student levels and faculty compensation, constructing campuses, and raising funds cannot be expected to be achieved in three months. However, for the sake of future development, the college has been constantly deliberating and striving for results in the three months following the order to implement improvements, hoping to live up to the Ministry's intentions of supervision. We have drafted a plan to implement strict entrance exams for new students starting in the 22nd academic year, and to provide rigorous training for both new and old students alike. In addition to finding ways to raise faculty compensation, we are also proceeding with the construction of a new campus. On July 9th of this year, the board of directors held a meeting, attended by nine directors including Mr. Li Shizeng, Mr. Du Yuesheng, and Mr. Wei Daoming. It was resolved to commence construction on the approximately 90-acre campus site purchased by the college in Beiqiao Town at the beginning of the academic year, proceeding step by step with all our efforts. We believe that our dedication will be understood by all, and that even if we cannot receive support from the authorities, we will not suffer unexpected destruction. The college originally scheduled the enrollment advertisement for July 5th and 6th as the examination dates. Later, according to the Ministry's instruction No. 5948, the enrollment dates had to be changed to late July at the earliest. The college complied with the order, changed the dates, published the correction, and reported it for record. The college has always respectfully and diligently followed the Ministry's orders without any negligence. We sincerely did not expect to be subject to the penalty of ceasing enrollment just after the first enrollment examination was completed. Preventing the college from continuing enrollment is tantamount to interrupting its life. Therefore, we dare to present the difficulties and circumstances to Your Excellency. We believe that an independent college is different from a comprehensive university. If one department of a university ceases enrollment, there are other departments to sustain it. This is not the case for an independent college. If one department ceases enrollment, then all first-year students in all departments will inevitably be completely suspended and unable to attend classes. This not only makes the curriculum arrangement incomplete, but also makes it impossible to connect the courses taught. This is the first difficulty. Since private schools do not have state funds to rely on, their financial resources depend heavily on student tuition and fees for maintenance. The college enrolled nearly 300 students last year. If enrollment is stopped, revenue will be sharply reduced by more than 30,000 yuan, which will inevitably have a significant impact on administrative expenses. This is the second difficulty. Since private school tuition is higher than that of any national school, the only way to attract students is through the school's reputation. Once enrollment is stopped, the school's reputation will suffer a great loss. Students in other grades will also seek to transfer to other schools. In this case, the number of students in the current year will not increase and may even decrease. How can the future be sustained? This is the third difficulty. The college's various plans for vigorous improvement have already been described above. If the above three difficulties are suddenly added to impede and obstruct the college, it may discourage those who are running the school and hinder the college's path to active improvement. We believe that the Ministry's repeated orders for improvement are intended to urge improvement, without any other intention. The Ministry should also uphold the spirit of impartiality and altruism to help those who are extremely willing to be responsible for improvement but face various difficulties, so that they can gradually flourish and develop, and truly have the opportunity to achieve final rectification. All the reasons for clarifying the difficult circumstances are presented in this document for your examination and verification. We request that you promptly rescind the order and temporarily allow the college to continue enrolling students, while ordering a deadline for improvement. The college will be very fortunate, and education will be very fortunate. Respectfully submitted.</p>

<p>Over 200 Applicants for University and Secondary School Departments in Recent Days</p>
<p>National Jinan University is the highest institution of learning for overseas Chinese. In recent years, under the active improvements of President Zheng, the school has achieved remarkable results and is deeply trusted by overseas elders. Therefore, even in this era of widespread overseas recession, overseas Chinese students are enthusiastically returning to China to apply to the school. The school is recruiting new students this time. For overseas Chinese students, the first examination was held on the 7th and 8th of this month, and over 50 overseas Chinese students were admitted. Many overseas Chinese students were unable to return in time due to the long journey and have requested an extension. Therefore, the school has specifically scheduled a second enrollment examination for the 28th and 29th of this month. Currently, over 100 students have returned to Shanghai and applied to the school. The secondary school department is exclusively for overseas Chinese students and does not enroll mainland students. Enrollment began on the 15th of this month, and as of yesterday (the 17th), there were over 120 overseas Chinese students. More than a dozen students have telegraphed in recent days stating that they have set off to return to China and are expected to arrive soon. It is expected that there will be approximately 200 students by the deadline of the 20th. The average number of overseas Chinese students this time is the largest from the Dutch East Indies (Java) and British Malaya.</p>

<p>Zhongzao Greatly Defeats Municipal First Team After reorganization, the Zhongzao table tennis team is now far superior to its former self, with a completely new lineup. Since participating in the Linghai Ding competition, they have won every match. The other day, they arranged a friendly match with the Hong Kong champion, the Eastern team, at the Jiande Savings Association. The team's main players, Liu Lin and Yang Guanci, were unable to participate due to unforeseen circumstances. Ding Zude played despite illness, resulting in a crushing defeat. Yesterday, the team encountered the once-famous Municipal First Team in the Linghai Ding Championship. As a result, Zhongzao won with a clean sweep of seven to zero.</p>

<p>Special Correspondence from London by Yizhi Ji</p>
<p>June 29th (Thursday)</p>
<p>Today was a quiet day, with no startling events or surprises, but there were many matches worth noting. Some matches even required watching until 8:00 PM when the lights came on. The sunlight was thin, the temperature was pleasant, and the courts were full of spectators. The outer courts were crowded, making it impossible for those who were not close to see. The ball boys were poorly trained, even on the center court. They often held the ball for a long time and did not know how to throw it, or let it roll around on the court during the match. One boy even caught a ball that was in play, even though it was sure to go out of bounds.</p>
<p>Seed and Cramm occupied the honored center court, with Vines and Miki in the first match. Seed won with three straight sets. The first set was won easily, the second set was much more difficult, and there was some concern for him during the third set. Seed's shots were full of judgment, and his net play was consistent with his planned strategy. His forehand and backhand shots were exceptionally even and very accurate, with few errors. His serve was also better than usual, and he constantly rushed to the net, usually successfully. He was often troubled by high balls, but he always smashed them with powerful or sharp-angled shots. Cramm's balls mostly came from the back court, and his groundstrokes were very good, but he made too many errors. He almost never came to the net, indicating his ability to defend on the baseline. In the first set, his defense was tight, making it very difficult for Seed to break through. The third set was a test for Seed. When Cramm was leading five to three, he had three chances to win the set with one shot, but Seed broke through and tied it at five to five. When leading eight to seven, Cramm served an unreturnable heavy ball, but it was ruled a foot fault. In any case, Seed had enough to benefit from it.</p>
<p>Faucquier had beaten Punnett, but in the first match, he lost to Menzel in three straight sets. This Czech player's shots were as hard and aggressive as this South African's, but he was more careful and attentive. The white lines of the court were his target, and although some of his shots were just barely out, most of his shots were unreturnable. Although Menzel was a large and fat man, he was dangerous and had to be constantly attacked.</p>
<p>Austin and Gran Hill competed on the center court, and Austin's victory was assured and well-deserved. His performance was straightforward and flawless, with nothing to fault. His serve was the best ever seen from his racket. Unfortunately, his right foot always swung over the line with each shot. The referee, who was supposed to pay special attention to foot faults, was deaf and dumb. Austin's footwork and angled shots were excellent, and whether he was backcourt stroking, net volleying, or hitting high or low balls, he was equally powerful.</p>
<p>Only in the second set did Gran Hill fight bravely, tying it at five to five. His serve was broken three times, making it equal, but his own serve was ineffective, and he ended the second set with a score of ten to eight. Austin broke his serve in style and got it again. The third set was one-sided, and Gran only won one game.</p>
<p>This second set, with its even battle formation, was the only good match seen on the center court. When Gran Hill recovers his form, he will be able to defeat the best or near-best Austin. Although Austin maintained his high position, he was often stumped by Gran, causing him to hesitate and make many errors. Gran Hill had a line ball that Austin let go, but it turned out to be a good ball that touched the line. Austin raised both hands to indicate his mistake. When he missed a kill shot, he couldn't help but sigh. In this critical situation, Austin's performance was not like that of an Englishman at all. The audience did not pay attention to this, but only enjoyed the excellence of his performance.</p>
<p>The ambitious Stephanie easily defeated Merlin, while Poullain swept Tunbel after a hard-fought set, six to zero, six to one. Spencer's victory over Crape was a surprise. These two South Africans only decided the winner after five sets. Crape, who held the racket with his left hand, was leading two to one, and his victory seemed certain, but he suddenly slumped and lost two sets in a row. Crape's serve was terrifying, aggressive, and swift. Spencer's return was excellent, never loosening up in the slightest.</p>
<p>On the center court, Sato and Bouin performed beautiful tennis skills, defeating Mann and Kellen in three straight sets. Their perfect cooperation was admirable. Mann and Kellen had mutual flaws and made no progress.</p>
<p>The women's doubles match on the center court started at nearly 7:00 PM, and the audience stayed without leaving. Miss Rounde and Miss Sheeran faced Miss Jie Gu Bai and Mrs. King (formerly Miss Ford). Jie Jin won the first set, but lost the rest. The decisive set was tied at six to seven games. Rounde finally advanced and won.</p>
<p>The cooperation between Miss Jie Gu Bai and Mrs. King is especially unique in women's doubles. One defends the net, and the other defends the baseline. The baseline long strokes are numerous and delayed, becoming monotonous, but their tactics are particularly beautiful and still make the audience happy and surprised. The ball flies back and forth from both corners, and the net defender waits for the opportunity to catch and kill. Miss Rounde is better, while Jie Gu Bai showed instability after the first set. Many good and easy opportunities were missed. Miss Sheeran is slightly better than Mrs. King. Both are good at running and do not know fatigue.</p>
<p>The match between Mrs. Maddy and Miss Sheeran made the court more colorful. Sheeran wore a backless top with two crisscrossing straps, while Mrs. Maddy often stayed on the baseline to stroke. The opponent was the first-ranked player in England, so the match lasted a long time. Mrs. Maddy made more mistakes than expected, but she still won the match, only losing three games. Miss Skrivan faced Miss Lierre, and Lierre resisted for a long time, winning the first set and almost winning the third. This match was held on the sixteenth court, and the audience was crowded, with no room to move. Miss Lierre's performance was excellent, and those who did not see it were bound to feel sorry.</p>

In the first week of the competition, Miss Xia and Li Baojun defeated Zhou Guanjun and his German wife with a score of six to three, two to six, and seven to five.

<h3 id="e185">Summoning-Rent Literature <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Yan</p>
<p>Ten odd years ago, when I first came to Shanghai, the first thing that caught my attention was the many small red paper slips plastered at the entrances of various alleyways and on various utility poles. With my limited knowledge, I always thought they were Fu (fortune) or Shou (longevity) characters, or signs indicating auspicious directions. Later, I made a point of taking a closer look and found that they were advertisements for vacant houses for rent, with the heading "Summoning Rent." "Summoning Rent" is originally a short idiom, but Shanghainese use it as a noun. Thus, summoning rent became a thing. If you ask someone, "Has the summoning-rent paper been posted?" people will laugh at you, because the usual way to say it is, "Has the summoning rent been posted?" Therefore, the "summoning rent" I am talking about here is also a thing, not an idiom.</p>
<p>Since there are so many "summoning rents" posted everywhere in Shanghai, and as soon as one is torn down, another one immediately takes its place, then all Shanghainese, all literate Shanghainese, must be good at writing "summoning rents." That's what I always thought at first. At the same time, I also felt that the language on these "summoning rents," if extrapolated using the principle of "practice makes perfect," would definitely be outstanding and surprising. Therefore, I paid attention to appreciating them at all times. The result, however, was extremely disappointing. Often, out of ten "summoning rents," their language, such as "water and electricity included," "living room shared," etc., nine of them are exactly the same. And at the end, they always have to add that nonsensical phrase "No families, please."</p>
<p>Once, it was my friend Dr. X's turn to write a "summoning rent." Unexpectedly, when the old man picked up the pen, he also wrote a long, stereotypical passage as usual. Finally, he also smoothly wrote the character "No"... At this point, I couldn't bear it any longer and immediately stood up to stop him. "It's rare that you're also writing 'summoning rents'! Why don't we take this opportunity to talk about 'summoning-rent literature'?" I suggested to him with great excitement.</p>
<p>"Good! Then please express your opinion first!"</p>
<p>"I think other things can be temporarily ignored, but the phrase 'No families, please' must be immediately eliminated with revolutionary means. Because based on the literal meaning, this sentence only has two explanations:</p>
<p>(1) Those who do not have kinship with the landlord should not ask.</p>
<p>(2) Men and women who are not formal family members should not ask.</p>
<p>However, the original intention of the person writing the "summoning rent" is definitely not the above two points, but rather "no renting to those without families," and they would also never investigate whether the woman you bring is your formal family member. As long as you are not a bachelor, you can definitely ask about it. So, the word "No" obviously has no possibility of existing and should be replaced with the word "Without"!"</p>
<p>After listening, Dr. X repeatedly agreed, but then picked out a newspaper from a pile of them. "Simply changing one character doesn't count as a revolution in 'summoning-rent literature.' Look at the title of this section of 'summoning rent.' Isn't it fresh and lively!"</p>
<p>I took the newspaper and looked at it. It turned out to be the six characters "Attention, Child Lovers." It was indeed a very eye-catching title. Who would have thought that below it was an advertisement for a house for rent near a French park?</p>
<p>I immediately expressed my deep admiration for the author's ingenuity and even asked Dr. X to let me cut out this section of the "summoning rent" to preserve it. From then on, everyone knew that I especially liked to study "summoning-rent literature." Soon, a friend who lived at the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Rue Luban in the French Concession came to me, asking me to draft a "summoning rent" for him. I thought for a long time and fortunately did not submit a blank paper. The topic was "Prerequisites for Choosing a Residence." In addition to the usual stereotypical phrases such as "spacious house, ample light," I also added the sentence, "Ideally located at the intersection of various tram lines in the French Concession." My friend left very satisfied. Later, I learned that as soon as this "summoning rent" was posted, his house was rented out that very morning.</p>

<p>Once, when the doorbell rang, the wife intentionally faced the bed, pretending to be asleep, anticipating that he would definitely sit close to the bed, perhaps giving her a light, sneaky kiss. When the kiss landed, she unexpectedly grabbed his neck, which would be quite interesting. However, she later found out that it was a classmate who had come. The wife pouted, and the classmate thought he had offended her somewhere. He never understood the secret behind it. After the wife told her husband, she said:</p>
<p>"I'll tell him tomorrow."</p>
<p>The wife wrinkled her nose and laughed, saying:</p>
<p>"You dare?"</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>The wife often instructed the husband:</p>
<p>"Finish work early and come back sooner. You know, waiting makes people anxious!"</p>
<p>The husband felt very happy, but in the evening, he intentionally came home a little later than usual. As expected, he saw that his wife was very unhappy. The husband regretted it, thinking that it was extremely meaningless. While he was deliberately prolonging the time outside, he felt equally lonely. Therefore, he carefully said to his wife:</p>
<p>"I'm willing to accept your punishment."</p>
<p>The wife lay on the bed, so angry that she didn't move. He lifted her arm to look: It turned out that the wife was laughing. So, as if granted amnesty, he also laughed. But in the end, the wife solemnly said:</p>
<p>"Don't do it next time!"</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>The husband, due to several unfinished matters, could not go to his hometown with his wife. After the train left, the wife frowned from time to time and didn't even eat lunch. Many people in her hometown asked about him, and the wife felt that they respected him, which secretly pleased her. But as soon as she thought about him not being by her side, she felt that everything was uninteresting, and she was unhappy all day long! The next day, the wife couldn't bear the loneliness any longer and wrote him a letter, writing only one sentence:</p>
<p>"Qing: I'm really not happy!"</p>
<p>The husband was initially confused when he saw it. Later, after thinking about it, he finished his work and immediately started his journey. When they met, the wife was still like in the letter, simply saying:</p>
<p>"Tonight, I can sleep peacefully!"</p>
<p>The husband smiled, proudly embraced his wife, and was about to kiss her; but the sound of their mother's footsteps gradually approached.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Putting the Cart Before the Horse <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— Si Su</p>
<p>Fish is what I desire, and bear's paw is also what I desire. If I cannot have both, I will give up fish and take bear's paw. There are many such things in the world! In the great fire in Caonitang, Laobaidu, Pudong, on the ninth day of the ninth lunar month, I heard about this kind of irreconcilable fact again. The result was also taking one thing that was desired and giving up another. But weighing the importance of the two is exactly the opposite of giving up fish and taking bear's paw. This shows that one side is wise, and the other is foolish.</p>
<p>When the great fire in Caonitang, Laobaidu, Pudong, had just been extinguished, I happened to have something to do in Pudong. I heard many rumors about the fire. The most tragic one was, of course, "eight or nine children were burned to death." At that time, someone explained the reason: the families of those who were burned were all boatmen or stevedores working at the docks. During the day, the men and women were not at home. All the children could not be taken with them, and if they were left at home, they could not guard the house. They had no choice but to lock the two doors, locking the children inside. As a result, when the fire broke out, the locked children could not escape and were burned to death. There was also a family where a five-year-old boy was already being carried in his mother's arms; in that glimpse, she suddenly remembered that there were twenty yuan on the bed. She hurriedly threw the child away and went in to get the money. Because the fire was getting fiercer, she only felt that escaping was important, and she forgot about the child. By the time she realized it, it was too late to go back in and save him! The next day, the rumor that eight or nine people were burned to death was confirmed to be a rumor. Only one person was burned to death, and he was indeed five years old, named Zhang Zhilong. Although it is not known whether he was harmed because his mother took twenty yuan, the victims were all very poor people, with most families having no food for the next day. However, the neck of the burned child's corpse had a silver necklace around it. This is somewhat similar to the twenty-yuan theory. If this taking and giving up is not a rumor at all, then the one who took and gave up was most likely Zhang Zhilong's mother.</p>
<p>Fish is originally not as good as bear's paw. One would only take fish if there was no bear's paw. With bear's paw, it becomes a treasure in front of one's eyes. Of course, one must give up fish and take bear's paw. Mencius was a wise man. How could he take the lesser of the two? A foolish woman is still a foolish woman. She only knows that money is precious. A five-year-old son is not as good as twenty yuan. She put the cart before the horse. However, looking around, it is not only foolish women who put the cart before the horse. Even some who consider themselves smart are still persistently confused about putting the cart before the horse!</p>

<p>Abandoning His Post to Meet a Soulmate, a Beauty Silently Permits</p>
<p>Inheriting a Family Fortune, a Strong Man Rejoices Wildly</p>
<p>When　Ms. Jiang saw this situation, it was clear that her daughter had completely agreed. Generally speaking, she had always been in favor of the Zhao family's marriage proposal, but her daughter had been picky. Now it was different, it had turned into her daughter being in favor and herself being picky, wasn't this a strange thing? Guan Yaowu's unfinished cigarette was still on the table, so Ms. Jiang picked one up and started smoking it herself, occasionally glancing at her daughter. Gui Zhi said: If you have something to say to me, just say it, why are you always spacing out? Ms. Jiang said: You agreed to this marriage with your own mouth, don't regret it later. Gui Zhi straightened her face and said: Regret what? I've seen through people's hearts. Men all treat women as toys, wanting them when they're happy, and not wanting them when they're not. I only know of men who lose women and then go find a job, but I've never heard of men who lose a job and then accommodate a woman. If you want to see people's hearts, you can see it from this. The world is just about exchanging hearts for hearts, I feel satisfied with this kind of thing. Jiang Dai quietly finished smoking that cigarette, nodded and said: As long as you say these words, what else can I say, then I'll just follow your wishes. Gui Zhi sat quietly on the side, without saying anything else. After a while, she heard the sound of leather shoes echoing out from the backyard, as if Company Commander Guan had left. Immediately afterward, Mr. Zhao in the backyard opened his throat and started singing opera there. Gui Zhi hadn't heard the sound of opera in the backyard for several days, the fact that the old gentleman was singing again at this time meant that the old gentleman was happy. In her heart, she thought about how the Zhao family could see her in a good light, unlike the Gan family, whose head of the bureau wanted to kick the poor children out. These past few days, the old gentleman probably knew that the marriage had changed a little, but when he met her, he still smiled, which was unlike that Master Gan, who would turn his back on people as soon as he changed his face. As she thought this way, she felt more and more the goodness of the Zhao father and son. (161)</p>

<p>The　weather is so hot, everyone is clamoring, and in the steaming heat, the weak life is easily attacked by various microbes. A moment of carelessness can lead to illness, which is a very dangerous thing! The ancients said: "Illness enters through the mouth," which is absolutely correct. So how should we be careful in choosing food in this dangerous season? What I am talking about here is the vegetables I often eat, which I think are very hygienic.</p>
<p>Ice-Crystallized Snow Chicken: There is a stall in the small vegetable market that specializes in selling whitened chicken. You can buy it for six small ocean coins and enjoy this flavor. Method: First, wash the white chicken with water and put it in a small jar, add a little water. Then, use agar-agar (commonly known as vegetable gelatin, produced in Japan. Recently, we have good vegetable gelatin coming from Qingdao, the quality is very good), cut it finely and add it, boil it until the white chicken is suitable for your teeth to chew, sprinkle with salt, pour in rice wine, and add MSG and other seasonings. (Be sure not to use soy sauce.) When the taste has penetrated into the white chicken, take it out, let it cool, and put it in the refrigerator. After two hours, prepare a large basin, take out the white chicken, and turn it upside down in the basin. This icy and fresh snow chicken will be dancing on your tongue.</p>
<p>Red and White Intermingling: The middle waist peak of the best-quality Zhejiang Xue Tui ham is the best part of the ham. Clean the accumulated dirt on the outside, take out the fresh red meat, and carefully cut it into thin, short strips (about one and a half inches long). Separately, buy a piece of chicken breast meat, cook it, and tear it into thin shreds, preferably cut to the same length as the ham shreds. If you like the taste of ginger, you can also add some thin ginger shreds. Place the cut ham shreds in a bowl, seal it with cotton paper, steam it on top of the rice cooker, take it out and let it cool, mix in the ginger shreds, and mix with refined salt, MSG, and rice wine. It is very fresh and delicious to use as an accompaniment to wine. It is also refreshing and pleasant to use with rice.</p>
<p>Crepe-Like Pig Trotters: Some friends don't like to eat meat in summer, but this method of eating is the best. Method: Wash fresh pig trotters and boil them thoroughly in boiling water. Put them in a bamboo basket and drain the water. Separately, use an iron wok to boil raw oil or vegetable oil thoroughly, put the pig trotters in, and fry them as much as possible, making sure that the skin of the pig trotters forms a honeycomb shape and the lean meat is also about the same. Take it out, drain the oil, and soak it in cold water. When the skin of the pig trotters is soaked, put washed Chinese cabbage in the pot, add a little water, put the pig trotters on top, and add salt, wine, and soy sauce. (If you like the aroma, you can also add fennel, cinnamon, etc.) Cover the pot tightly, do not open it halfway. Simmer over low heat for an hour, then take it out of the pot. The aroma is excellent, unprecedented. As for the rich and delicious taste, it is even more indescribable. The Chinese cabbage at the bottom also has a special flavor.</p>
<p>Mustard Eel Slices: If it is only for two or three people to eat, then it is enough to buy four thick yellow eels. To eat this, the cruelty is real. Nail the head of the eel to a square board, and use a small knife to open it on its back (hold the tip of its tail with your left hand). It is best to only use the fat meat on its back. After opening it, cut it into one-and-a-half-inch-long slices, spread them on a bamboo basket and let them dry. Start another oil pan, pour it in and fry it thoroughly, add rice wine, refined salt, and then add the prepared mustard powder, stir evenly with a spatula. After all the water in the pot is absorbed into the eel slices, take it out. The clear and lasting taste can hang on your taste buds.</p>
<p>Spicy Ribs: Buy pre-cut ribs from the butcher shop, wash them, let them dry, and soak them in good light soy sauce. After the salty taste has penetrated, mix a little flour into the egg white, pour the ribs in and stir evenly. Boil raw oil or vegetable oil, put the ribs in one by one and fry them thoroughly. Take it out and drain the oil. Separately, mix chili powder and sesame oil evenly, put the ribs back into the pot, pour in the mixed chili powder, stir quickly with a spatula, and then take it out of the pot. In addition to the flavors of pepper salt, sugar, and vinegar, it will make you taste another kind of flavor.</p>
<p>Jadeite Topping: This is a common and flavorful dish. Use four green-shelled duck eggs, break them in a large bowl. Separately, use lean and fatty ham (i.e., half red, half white), cut into similarly narrow (about one and a half inches long, about three minutes wide) small pieces, spread around the bowl, red facing out, white facing in. Then, use a fresh lotus pod, peel off the hard skin of each seed tip, then cover the bowl with another bowl in the center of the egg (to prevent water vapor from entering). Steam it on top of the rice cooker. When eating, you will feel a clear fragrance, very much like "this dish should only be found in heaven."</p>

<h3 id="e191">Let the Womenfolk Have a Go! <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Yutang</p>
<p>Last week I saw a news item in the mainland newspapers. An American woman, the president of some Women's Rights League, named something like Mrs. Inez Hayne, I can't quite remember. She said, as if divinely inspired, that the world ruled by men had become a mess. From now on, women should be allowed to try ruling the world, and then there would be a solution.</p>
<p>As one of the men who "rule the world," I am in complete agreement with this proposal. I never wanted to rule the world in the first place. After ruling for half my life, I'm a little tired of it, and I'm willing to abdicate and hand over the world to any fool brave enough to take on this responsibility. I'd like to take some time off. I'm a thorough failure. I think all honest men will agree with me. Even if the aborigines of Tasmania were willing to come forward and take on this responsibility, I would be willing to hand over the world to them. I'm just afraid they're as smart as Xu You and won't come forward.</p>
<p>I want to retire. I feel, and I think most men can agree, that "having a son is enough to make one happy, and being without an official position makes one feel light." It is said that men are the masters of their own lives and the masters of the world, and the masters of their own souls and the masters of all human affairs; it is said that the best jobs in the world, such as being a civil official, a military general, a mayor, a judge, a director, or an editor-in-chief, are all monopolized by men. Honestly, who is happy about these things? The facts are very simple. A professor of psychology at Columbia University once said that the real division of labor between men and women is that men earn money and women spend it. I am very much in favor of switching things around. I would love to see women sweating in the docks, meeting rooms, editorial offices, and government offices, while we wear light-colored cheongsams in the garden, waiting for our loved ones to come out of the government offices and take us to the movies. Mrs. Heyne, with this wonderful idea, is truly lovely.</p>
<p>But let's put aside these selfish words. Honestly, when we look at our own governance record, we should be ashamed. Whether it's China or foreign countries, things can't be worse than they are now under the rule of men. So when the girls come to us and ask, "Let us womenfolk have a go," I can only honestly admit the failure of us men and hand over the power of the world to the womenfolk.</p>
<p>The womenfolk are good at giving birth to children, but we menfolk are bent on going to war and killing the best children. This is really called short-sightedness. But there's nothing we can do about it. It's in our nature. Men are always belligerent. Women at most pull hair and scratch faces at each other. If the wounds don't get infected, there's actually not much harm. Women at most fight each other with broomsticks, but men have to use machine guns against each other. Heywood Brown said that the problem is that we like to listen to gongs and drums, or modern military music. As long as we like to listen to gongs and drums, war will not be eliminated for a single day, this can be asserted. We can't resist the sound of gongs and drums. If women ruled the world and were about to declare war, then we could say, "Girls, the world is yours now. If you have to fight, go fight yourselves." Then no one would use machine guns against each other, and the world would truly be at peace.</p>
<p>We are really too shameless. The disarmament conference failed. The economic conference also failed. People, men, have failed. Everyone knows that the world should now ban poison gas and trade peacefully. But what are we doing? We don't invite contemporary sages such as Russell, Einstein, and Rolland to come out, but instead hand these matters over to "experts"! We want to reduce armaments and promote peace, but instead we invite a group of naval and military experts—killers with expertise in slaughter technology—to come to the meeting, and then we are shocked and surprised that the disarmament conference has failed. Later, everyone felt that war debts had to be canceled and tariffs had to be abolished in order for the global recession to end. What did we do? We invited some university professors, statisticians, and shortsighted "experts" who only know how to calculate percentages of tariffs to come to the meeting. And then we were shocked and surprised that the economic conference had also failed. Do you think these tariff experts would still have food to eat if tariffs were abolished? This is like inviting philology experts to come to a meeting to abolish Chinese characters.</p>
<p>Now I don't care about anything anymore. Diplomats are putting on white kidskin gloves and chatting with each other, but the clouds of war are spreading across the sky, and we are,</p>
<p>being clever. If we don't hurry up and take back the power to govern the world from the hands of white-gloved diplomats and thick-spectacled experts, there will soon be a great war, and everything will be over. So there's no need to worry too much about it. Therefore, when the womenfolk want to volunteer, I can only say, "Come on, girls! God bless you! Anyway, the results you achieve won't be worse than what we have now."</p>
<p>Honestly, governing the world is not very difficult, at least not as difficult as the "experts" tell us it is. If you want to ban poison gas, then ban poison gas. It can be done if you are sincere and if you don't invite "experts" to come to the meeting. Execute all the experts and invite George Bernard Shaw, Einstein, and Madame Curie to rule the world, and a second world war can and certainly will be avoided.</p>
<p>If monkeys knew about the things we humans are doing in Geneva, they would laugh their teeth out.</p>
<p>At least I myself am prepared to step down and hand over power to Tao Lao San, Fu Chun Lou Lao Liu, Zheng Yuxiu, and Zhang Mojun. Assuming I can save a little money, I want to run away to an island in the South Pacific or burrow into the mountains of Africa. If the likes of Fu Chun Lou Lao Liu still can't put an end to this disaster and European civilization is completely burned down, then I, living in a tree in the African jungle, can pat my chest and say, "God! At least I was honest."</p>
<h3 id="e192">How Do We Educate Children? <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— A Traveler from Fukuoka</p>
<p>Seeing the mention of "Kong Yiji" reminded me of how China has always educated its children.</p>
<p>Nowadays, there are naturally all sorts of textbooks, but in village schools, there are still the "Three Character Classic" and the "Hundred Family Surnames." During the late Qing Dynasty, some people read the "Prodigy Poem," which boasted the glory of "scholars," with lines like "The emperor values heroes, writing is taught to you, all other occupations are inferior, only studying is noble." Some people read the "Young Student's Jewel Forest," which taught the clichés of classical Chinese prose with lines like "In the beginning of chaos, heaven and earth were established, the light and pure rose to become the sky, the heavy and turbid sank to become the earth." I don't know what came before that, but I heard that the "Taigong Family Instructions" were used during the late Tang and early Song dynasties, but they were lost for a long time, and were only later discovered in the Dunhuang caves. In the Han Dynasty, things like the "Jijiupian" were read.</p>
<p>Even so-called "textbooks" have changed so much in the last thirty years. Sometimes saying this, sometimes saying that, today's principles are like this, tomorrow's ideas are like that. Without adding "education," it's fine. But with "education" added, many people with internal contradictions are created from schools, and because of old social relationships, on the one hand, it's still the old fossil of "in the beginning of chaos, heaven and earth were established." China wants writers, wants "literary giants," but also wants true scholars. If someone were to write a history, making a clear record of the methods and books used to educate children throughout Chinese history, to let people understand how our ancestors, and even ourselves, were cultivated, then their merit would not be less than that of Yu (although he might just be a worm).</p>
<p>The contributors to "Free Talk" often include people who are learned in both ancient and modern times. I believe that there are many qualified people for this work. I wonder if anyone intends to do this? Bringing up this issue now is also knowing that it is easier said than done, so I can only speak empty words, hoping for strong proponents to develop it.</p>
<h3 id="e193">Child <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Lengjia</p>
<p>The child has been born for eight full months.</p>
<p>Round face, black eyes, plump white body, he smiles when he sees people, no one doesn't like him.</p>
<p>His wife especially loves him like something precious, holding him in the house all day long. She forgets about doing everything else.</p>
<p>But I hate him.</p>
<p>This fellow, ever since his mother had him, I've had bad luck: cocoons have fallen to twenty yuan per load, a hundred catties of grain is not worth two yuan, wheat and everything else has fallen in price, and I'm burdened with debt.</p>
<p>"Sell him," I often think: "We already have three sons, what do we need him for?"</p>
<p>And he's so good at acting spoiled, always crying for milk. The more he cries, the more awkward I feel, and I can't help but hit him. He cries even louder. My wife quickly comes over to pick him up, complaining to me:</p>
<p>"He didn't offend you, why are you hitting him for no reason?"</p>
<p>I often reply to her fiercely:</p>
<p>"You watch, one day I'll have to sell him."</p>
<p>Early this morning, as soon as I got out of bed, I heard him crying. I hated it so much, I ran outside like crazy. It was quiet outside, my wife had gone to wash rice, only the three sons were playing in the house. This was a good opportunity, I hurriedly picked him up and ran out the door.</p>
<p>As soon as I got out the door, I ran into my wife.</p>
<p>"Where are you taking him?" she stopped me and asked.</p>
<p>"To sell him, I don't want him in my house."</p>
<p>The rice sieve fell from my wife's hand, she rushed up to snatch him. But her strength was not as great as mine, I pushed her away with force and ran forward.</p>
<p>I stuck a straw tag on the child's head and shouted, "Selling a child!" I walked around the town all day.</p>
<p>No one paid attention to me. It started to rain. My stomach was hungry. I had no choice but to hold the child and go home.</p>
<p>As soon as I got home, I saw the three sons crying in the house, the rice sieve was still on the ground, but my wife was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>Several neighboring children told me a lot of bad news: some said she jumped into the river and died, some said she ran to the mountains, and some said they saw her running on the road, crying and shouting, "Give me back my child!"</p>
<p>I was stunned for a moment, my heart aching violently. I thought of my wife's many good qualities: how she shared my joys and sorrows, how she helped me maintain this family, how she took care of so many children...</p>
<p>"I have to bring her back." I said to myself, not bothering to put the child down in my hand, and ran out again.</p>
<p>It started to rain outside, pattering. The raindrops wet my clothes and body; they also wet the child's clothes and body. But I still ran in the rain regardless, shouting madly:</p>
<p>"Old Mother, where are you? Come back soon!"</p>
<p>There was no response, only the sound of raindrops pattering.</p>
<p>The child was also crying loudly in my arms.</p>
<h3 id="e194">Shanghai, Farewell! <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Yao Ke</p>
<p>After being sick, people often develop a special sensation in their mouths. No matter how delicious the dishes are, you know in your heart that it's good to eat, but as soon as it enters your mouth, it feels a bit strange -- tasteless!</p>
<p>In the past year or two, I have often had a special feeling in my spirit. This is not the fashionable "youth sickness" of boredom, because I have no economic pressure, nor am I suffering from unrequited love, and since I am alone in Shanghai, I certainly have no family problems. I do not dislike my work at all; in my spare time, I am very good at enjoying myself to the full; in terms of life, I can be considered a happy young man.</p>
<p>Normally, the "special feeling" I am talking about is subconscious, and I am not aware of its existence. However, it often floats into my consciousness like a dark cloud, without me realizing it. It does not necessarily lurk in my loneliness or boredom; often in moments of exhilaration, in the midst of busyness, I would feel as if I had been electrocuted, and in that instant, the exhilarating entertainment before me would become "tasteless."</p>
<p>People who have been sick often like to eat pickled cucumbers, salted radishes, and the like, to change their taste because their mouths are tasteless. I also want to change my taste -- Shanghai is really too greasy!</p>
<p>The train to Nanjing, full of stars, chased the cool night breeze westward. Ten minutes later, the skyline of this "greasy city" gradually disappeared into the dark night.</p>
<p>Shanghai, farewell!</p>
<h3 id="e195">Life and Machines <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Yang</p>
<p>One</p>
<p>A reddish-brown steamer was moored at the Swire Wharf, a plume of black smoke rising from the chimney, standing straight up in the windless air; the soot, however, scattered and fell, sprinkling into the river and onto the heads of the coolies crowded on the wharf.</p>
<p>Most of the coolies were bare-chested, with gray-black cloths draped over their shoulders; their pants were patched with all sorts of patches, and were bound at the waist with moldy leather belts, blackened cloth belts, oily hemp ropes, or brand-new straw ropes. They stood in two uneven rows, filing into the belly of the great steamer through a small steel door. Those standing in the back craned their necks, anxiously looking forward, revealing an eagerness to go up immediately. But when they came out of the cabin, carrying packages that exceeded their own weight on their shoulders, they remembered that fatigue had already damaged every cell in their bodies: their thin, dark feet drew zigzag lines of unequal length, having long been unable to support even their thin, dark bodies. Beneath their disheveled hair, beads of sweat the size of soybeans rolled down their foreheads. Their dry, withered mouths sometimes opened suddenly, and "cough!" a mouthful of phlegm containing countless tuberculosis bacteria fell onto the floor.</p>
<p>The low pressure of the riverside in June penetrated into the gloomy cargo hold. Inside the hold, carbonic acid gas, the stench of sweat, and swirling dust, mixed with chaotic grunting sounds, penetrated into the coolies' nostrils, throats, and ears. However, the stench, the noise, and the distant home were all thrown to the back of their minds. Their only hope was that after the package was passed from the shoulders of the man coming from the lower hold by two strong men, it would be tossed a little lighter onto their shoulders.</p>
<p>The lower hold was lit by yellowish electric lights, which mixed with the grayish-white light leaking in from the staircase exit, faintly exuding a gloomy smell. Large packages were bound with iron bars, stacked layer upon layer on the floor. Dozens of machine-like animals, forgetting joy and happiness, labored in order in their weariness, like wheels driven by the same spring: four hands picked up a large package, placed it on another bare shoulder, and turned back to lift the second package; another pair of feet dragged their heavy steps, walking up the stairs to the left in their own grunting sounds, handing the heavy load over to the two strong men at the exit, and walking down to the right in the grunting sounds of others. This machine turned automatically, never stopping, and the goods flowed out of the exit like feces. If a part of the machine malfunctioned due to fatigue, then the bamboo whip in the hands of a person wearing a black gauze shirt replaced the lubricating oil, falling like raindrops on that part of the machine; thus, the wheel that had slipped its gears returned to the right track.</p>
<p>A thin, dark body carried a package, trudging up the stairs, his chest heaving with panting. The thin, dark, filthy flesh sank deeply, and the ribs were exposed like a model in a human anatomy museum. The dim light traced lines of shadow on them with the movements of the chest. The greasy pants barely covered the knees, and the two calves were exposed like tree branches in winter; with each step, the pair of knees shook as if paralyzed.</p>
<p>"Faster! Corpse! If you don't have the strength, don't eat this rice!" Such a roar was spat out from the top of the gauze shirt, and the bamboo whip whistled in the air, like a venomous snake seeking someone to bite. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e196">Financial and Gold Markets Surge and Crash <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>Fluctuations Reach Ten Yuan, Falls Measure Nine Yuan</p>
<p>Commodity Prices, Exchange Rates, Silver Prices Continue to Open Lower, then Surge</p>
<p>White House's Inflationary Policy Remains Unchanged, then Sharply Declines</p>
<p>After several days of consecutive gains in the gold market, yesterday's morning session rose and then fell, dropping extremely rapidly. Although the afternoon market was low, it remained stable. Initially, foreign telegrams indicated that the British and American silver markets were falling, and exchange rates were also falling. The forward silver price on the metal exchange fell by 0.02, American wheat fell by 0.05, and American cotton fell by 0.19 pounds. Stocks fell by a small 2.19 yuan. The gross price initially opened at 77.78 yuan and continued to rise to over 80 yuan. After the customs closure, the initial situation showed an upward trend, with Qingfa Yongnu trying hard to buy in. After entering, the selling pressure surged to take advantage of the high prices, and the suppliers were unusually excited, resulting in a falling wind. The 80 yuan and 70 yuan marks were broken in quick succession. However, Reuters reported that the White House announced that the US government's inflationary policy had not changed its original intention, so the public believed that the authorities would continue to inflate the US dollar. Although this news was commonplace, since it was a government statement, it caused the gold market to fall back. After the afternoon close, it was once seen at 66-67 yuan. The afternoon market saw a sharp drop, so buyers surged, and the exchange rate market became more tense, stabilizing the situation. Bombay initially fell by 4 annas, then rose by 2 annas. After several consecutive narrow declines, today's fluctuations reached 20 yuan, which was a necessary reaction. Although Guangdong merchants sold, it was not as large as rumored. The cooked red price was increased by 175 yuan, and the swap spread was 6.5 yuan. The market conditions for today are recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 881.5 yuan, a rise of 6.3 yuan compared to the previous close. Goods opened at 1.3 yuan, and the exchange rate opened tight. The near-term selling price for British exchange was 1 shilling, 2 pence and 0.75, and the American exchange was 17.0625 yuan. Initially, prices hovered as banks successively supplied. By the time the October American dollar was difficult to settle at 0.375, goods from Yuanfeng, Yongheng, Zhifeng, Yongyuanmao, and Yongtongyi came in, and gradually rose from 0.05 yuan. Then, because the October American dollar was again difficult to settle at 0.3125, it rose to 4.2 yuan. Yongfeng sold off, and it became 2.2 yuan. Qingfa Yong came up and bought fiercely, and Dadecheng, Hengyu, Yuanmao, and Yong all bought in, and it rose to 5 yuan. Pan Gen came out with the November American dollar at 0.4375, Hengxing sold slightly and it fell. Huabi came out with the October dollar at 0.25, HSBC listed the British dollar down 0.125, the American dollar down 0.25. Fuyu, Daxing, and Yongyongfeng all sold, plus Hengxing and Hengtai vigorously sold. Huabi again blocked the October American dollar at 0.375, and it fell to 79 yuan. Yifeng and Yongyuanchun bought in on the dip, and the situation improved. Zhengjin took the November half yuan at 0.5625 against a match, Huabi again ate 0.4375, Qingfa Yong, Qianchangxiang again came to buy fiercely, and it rebounded to 85.2 yuan. Zhengchang came to sell, slightly falling. Zhifeng, Yongheng, Qingfa Yong, Bingxing, Yifeng, Yongzhaofeng, Changyuansheng, Yongyuanmao, Yongfuyu, etc. jointly fought to sell, and a complete fall began. Then foreign telegrams again brought news of inflated currency, and it fell to 75.5 yuan. MacGalli and Helan matched the October American dollar at 0.5625, Shunli and Ruixing slightly accepted, and it improved to over 8 yuan. But because Hengxing, Dadecheng, Hongli, and Daxingyong resold, people's hearts were originally suspicious, Guangdong merchants released, and the decline was quite rapid, retreating to 1.2 yuan. Huabi ate the October half yuan, although there was a rebound, people's hearts were extremely weak. Yuanshengyong and Ruikang came out with the November American dollar at 0.75, no one wanted it and it fell to 69.5 yuan. At the afternoon close, it slightly rebounded, closing at 871.2 yuan. After the close, Hengyu vigorously sold, and it fell to within 67 yuan. Goods were auctioned at 67 yuan.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at 871.5 yuan, (the scene initially retreated from 68-69 yuan to 8 yuan half, which was Hengxing selling slightly. However, Fuyu, Shunli, etc. bought in, so it rebounded). Goods opened at 1 yuan. Shunli, Qianchangxiang, Yuanyu, Yongyuanheng, Dadecheng, Yongfeng, Zhaofengchang, etc. all bought in. Hengxing, Bingxing, and Yuanmaoyong sold out, but because MacGalli ate the November American dollar at 0.8125, Mitsui even took 0.75, and gradually rose from 0.08 yuan to over 6 yuan. Fuyu, Yicheng, Hongxing, Hongli, and Yuanshengyong bought in again. Mitsui unexpectedly took the November American dollar at 0.625, and it rose to 7.4 yuan. Hengxing and Yiyu sold off. Pan Gen came out with the October American dollar at 0.4375, and it became 4.3 yuan. At this time, it could still rebound, but because Fuchangyuanmao and Daxingyong, etc. jointly supplied, the November American dollar at 0.6875 was difficult to sell, and it fell to 2.5 yuan. Chunyuan Yong and Zhifeng Yong, etc. bought in, Bombay was down a small 4 annas, and it rose to 4.8 yuan. Zhaofengchang and Fuyu supplied the bar, closing at 873.3 yuan. Goods were auctioned at 3 yuan. After the close, Bingxing and Tongyi bought in the bar, and it rose to 4 yuan. The highest point of the day was 885.2 yuan, and the lowest was 869.5 yuan, with a fluctuation of 15.7 yuan. As a result, it fell slightly by 1.9 yuan compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The posted price was because HSBC Bank's American exchange rate was reduced by 0.025, to 26.75 yuan. The combined standard gold price was 897 yuan. According to the closing price, it was about 24 yuan less than the previous close, with ten yuan more pressed. The registered price for this month was 882 yuan, September 877 yuan, and October 871 yuan. The morning supplementary water was 882 yuan, and the afternoon supplementary water was 884 yuan. The cooked red price was increased by 175 yuan. Tianjin merchants continued to supply, increasing by 175 yuan. Taikang Run sold off, increasing by 173 yuan. In the afternoon market, the future standard declined, and the transaction price ranged from 180 yuan to 185 yuan, still supplied by Tianjin merchants. Yingfeng Heng, etc. accepted it. The transaction was about 600 taels. The swap spread for September and October was posted by Dadecheng at 7 bars, Changshengyong at 35 bars, and Yingfeng Heng at 28 bars, all accepted by Shunli at 6.5 yuan. The bar for this month is still counted as 763 bars, and September has 2,667 bars.</p>
<p>Transactions in the arena have turned prosperous, with Hengxing Hengxing Shunli Yongfeng Zhifeng Yong Yuanshengyong Daxingyong Fuchang Zhaofengchang Hengtai Ruikang, etc. all being sellers, Qingfa Yong (initially bought in 1,000 several hundred bars) Yuanheng Dadecheng Yuanxingyong Qianchangxiang Wanxing Yicheng Yiyu Hengyu, etc. being on the buying side.

There were still no large customers entering or leaving the arena, and it still belonged to a state of chaotic circulation. Although there was no change in the situation, the floods became more severe, and the people's energy slightly slackened, and the market price was exhausted. At the opening of the morning session, only the 1918 customs tax suddenly rose by 0.4 yuan, to a price of 34 yuan, and the compilation still tended to be weak due to more sellers than buyers. Afterwards, various kinds also failed to cheer up, and all returned to a small 0.1 to 0.3 yuan or so. At the close, only the 1918 customs tax fell by 0.3 yuan, because the upward plate had risen too much, and the rest continued a small 0.1 or 0.2.

<p>The yarn market fell in the morning and rebounded at noon, but the situation was still flat. Because actual demand was not smooth, yarn inventory was difficult to reduce. Inferior yarn was being vigorously dumped in all directions, and domestic yarn was under significant pressure from it. It was heard that the Shenxin Yarn Factory released a large number of 20-count "Person Bell" yarn, more than 10,000 bales, for October, November, December, and January delivery, at a discounted price of 195.5 yuan. The industry accepted it and hedged in the label yarn market.</p>

<p>The man-made cotton label market opened in the morning with a flat sentiment due to the weakness of U.S. cotton.

In the afternoon, rumors spread that the United States would resume currency inflation, and buying interest rose again, with prices rising by more than one yuan per month.

<p>The cotton market initially weakened and then rose. The U.S. cotton market sentiment was still weak, but most local market participants believed that it had the power to rebound, and there were more buyers. Some believed that the weather was favorable, and spot traders hedged heavily. The Ningbo Yao Cotton Group sold the most for October delivery. In the afternoon, rumors spread that the United States would have currency inflation, and retail investors bought in, causing prices to rise.</p>

<p>After the flour market opened yesterday morning, the prices of each month presented a flat and weak picture. Because the price of foreign wheat was reported, Chicago had fallen by 1.65 yuan and Canada had fallen by 46 jiao. Therefore, the market sentiment was already sluggish when the prices were opened. However, in the current market situation, because various factories are unwilling to excessively sell off and some only do hedging business, the amount of goods released is small, so the decline is also moderate. When the market opened in the afternoon, it was flat at first, but later, some speculative bulls believed that the United States would inflate the currency again and commodity prices would naturally increase. Therefore, those who were nervous rushed in. In fact, the current situation is likely to be irrelevant. After this, the spot market must flow smoothly to prevent accumulation, so that there can be a reliable foothold. As a result, this month was slightly better by 2.5 li, September was better by 7.5 li, October was better by 1 fen, November was better by 1 fen and 2.5 li, and December and January were better by 5 li.</p>
<h3 id="e211">No Major Changes in Futures Wheat <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the futures wheat market presented an initial flat and then stable state. In the morning, due to the foreign wheat price being reported, there was a rebound of 6 jiao and 1.65 yuan. Market sentiment was flat when the factory closed prices, with a fall of 1 to 2 fen compared to the previous day. However, the major short sellers have now turned to a wait-and-see attitude, and the selling pressure has decreased, so the market has also stabilized. When the market opened in the afternoon, trading was still smooth and the market fluctuated. Later, because the flour market rose slightly, it also slightly increased. As a result, September was better by 1 fen, and the rest were unchanged. The spot wheat market has become lonely again. High-quality goods customers are unwilling to sell, and medium and second-class goods are slightly traded due to the condition of the goods. Yangzhou wheat is 3.5 yuan, second-class is 4.7 yuan, Changzhou wheat is 3.4 yuan, Bengbu wheat is 3.75 yuan, wheat is 3.68 yuan, Zhenjiang wheat is 3.55 yuan, and Liuhe wheat is 3.55 yuan. A total of 1,500 bales were traded.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were more than 20 sources, and the retail and wholesale sales were the same as before. However, because the arrival of goods has been scarce for several days, market sentiment has slightly turned firm, and sellers have also tightened up. Therefore, the market situation has risen, and the market prices of thick japonica, thin paddy, and Duyang tip rice have all increased by several fen to more than 1 jiao. There was not much difference in the price of Yuan. The factory owner was newly determined, as well as the old price.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were about 28 or 29 sources from the lower reaches of the river. Various sales channels in the market continued to digest the goods. The market situation: the price of white japonica and Dujian from the Northern Group was slightly higher by a few fen. Early thin paddy was flat and weak. Yangjian was stable at the top and weak at the second level. Dongxin japonica white Yuan and埠尖 were stable. Old guest tip rice was tight by 3 or 4 fen. New guest tip rice showed a weakening trend.</p>
<h3 id="e213">Foreign Indica Rice Stabilizes, Domestic Rice Continues to Be Dealt With <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign indica rice market had stabilized because domestic sales were active and owners were unwilling to reduce prices further. The market followed suit. However, it was difficult to achieve smooth sales at once. Indica rice needs to wait for the new rice to arrive, while foreign rice is expected to fall by another 2 or 3 jiao before it can attract large buyers. Although current sales are active, the price is high and there is not much profit, so they maintain a wait-and-see attitude. However, Hunan Province had a bumper harvest of early rice this year, and late rice is predicted to be abundant. Old rice from previous years has fallen to below 1.5 yuan, and new rice is also around 1.5 yuan. After autumn, large quantities of old stocks and machine-milled rice from Hunan Province will be shipped to Shanghai. However, there is a shortage of existing stocks, and the market is unusually sluggish. Market sentiment is temporarily stable, and there is mostly medium and second-class rice in stock. Due to seasonal reasons, the longer it is stored, the older it becomes. Yesterday, the Ningbo group purchased 141 bags of Hunan machine-milled oil rice at a price of only 7 yuan, which was also due to the age of the goods. Fuzhou sales were still greedy. Yesterday, because Hunan polished rice could not be selected, only 245 bags of Nanjing machine-milled indica rice were purchased at a price of 5.93 to 5.9 yuan. In addition, 64 bags of Wuxi machine-milled indica rice were purchased at a price of 6.2 yuan. There is a lot of foreign rice in stock, and owners intend to sell it off, but the cost is high and they are unwilling to sell at a loss. There has been no agreement on the small-grain rice negotiated with the Zhejiang and Fujian groups a few days ago. Yesterday, only one Saigon number was purchased by this street for 400 bags, and the price was still 7.7 yuan. Saigon has less in stock, and the continued purchase by this street seems to be able to stabilize the market temporarily. However, because there is too much small-grain rice in stock, it is feared that it will continue to decline.</p>
<h3 id="e214">Sesame Market Plunges <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>The most depressed market in the grain market is sesame. Previously, after the foreign firms once moved, it caused a lot of arrivals, but the foreign firms stopped moving again, and the scattered retailers rarely paid attention, resulting in a plummet in the market, and there is little power to recover it. Currently, high-quality white sesame is about 7.5-6 jiao, but there are no buyers. Only yellow sesame relies on the Shaoxing group to gradually move. There is no inquiry at all. Yesterday, the market traded more than 1,000 bags of clean yellow sesame from foreign firms at a price of 8.85 yuan, and more than 400 bags of raw goods at a price of 6.8 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market rebounded and fell due to rising and falling bidding prices, coupled with the trend of sluggish actual sales. The association divided the market into 24 raw white sand, ordinary goods at 21.1 yuan, and Double P Mark at 21.15 yuan, both down by 5 fen from the previous day. The asking price for No. 20 medium white sand was as usual, with no movement. Dutch red was trending tighter due to a shortage of high-quality goods. KD Mark initially asked for 16.8 jiao, and then traded at 7.5 jiao, up by 5 fen. Ordinary goods were 16.45 jiao. Taikoo Sugar B Mark had transactions yesterday, initially at 21.55 jiao, and then at 5.3 jiao. Guohua Zhonghua cotton white top number was 20.3 jiao, No. 1 was 1 jiao, No. 2 was 19.95 jiao, No. 3 was 7.5 jiao, and No. 4 was 5.5 jiao, all slightly lower by half a jiao from the previous day. Zhenji No. 1 cotton white was 20.2 jiao, and No. 2, 3, 4, and 5 were withdrawn according to the reference price. Wufu white ice had slight transactions, and each stone was still 17.8 jiao.</p>

<p>Hunan lotus previously saw a decline in market prices, and ordinary traders once reached 54-5 yuan. It was found that the current price in the Hankou market has rebounded. For example, Xiangtan lotus is 26.8 taels per stone, and Hengzhou lotus is 24.4 taels. The goods are open. If fewer batches arrive later, it is expected to tighten further. The local market asked for 64 yuan for the top Xiangtan lotus, 62 yuan for Jiuxi lotus, and so on, from 60 yuan to 59 yuan. White lotus has also rebounded, with the ground price being 40 yuan and the Shanghai market being 45-6 yuan.</p>

<p>Hangzhou Autumn Silkworms Begin to Sleep and Open Leaves: In Linping, Gaosi, Sanbao, and other places in Hangzhou, the number of autumn silkworm eggs has increased, and the initial development is very good. During the third sleep, there was some leaf tipping due to the improper weather. The early groups have begun to sleep and open leaves, and they can be fired in a few days.</p>
<p>More Than 100 Pieces of Chinese Silk Shipped to the United States: The U.S. mail ship "Cleveland" this time, Lianna and others have a total of 185 pieces of yellow and white factory silk, which are shipped to Seattle and other ports.</p>
<p>Sales of Rayon Show a Clear Increase: The exchange rate is sluggish, and the price of rayon is increasing. Customer sales are clearly increasing. Yesterday, Shanghai silk merchants only imported 22 boxes of various brands of current and forward goods such as Shuanghua Hai Wuxing Yishu. The net price ranged from 181 yuan to 174.5 yuan, which was about several jiao higher than before.</p>
<p>Silk Sales in Europe and America Remain Sluggish: Silk prices in European and American markets continue to decline. Grade A white factory silk in London fell to 8 shillings and 6 pence per pound, and Grade B fell to 8 shillings. The price in Lyon, New York, also fell by 5-6 yuan to 10 yuan. Therefore, the silk price transferred from overseas telegrams is smaller, and the market sentiment is sluggish. Yesterday, only Xinfu and others imported 20 packs of white factory silk and 30 packs of yellow factory silk. The price remained flat and weak.</p>
<h3 id="e218">Gongxi Green Tea Trading Still Strong <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the local foreign tea market, Gongxi green tea from Tunxi and other places, Russian-owned协助会洋行 and Bai Tou-owned 裕隆富林 and other firms, were all priced from 90 yuan. The price of medium and low-grade goods was 40-50 yuan, with no increase or decrease compared to the past. There were also scattered transactions of precious eyebrow pearl tea and large-scale split-selling goods. However, high-grade pearl tea was the most popular. As for various sources, more than 2,000 boxes arrived yesterday, of which many were of excellent color and quality suitable for sale. The market is expected to make progress.</p>
<h3 id="e219">Prices of Woolen Fabrics for Lower Garments Are High and Sales Are Sluggish <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>Men's suit overcoat woolens continued to be released yesterday, with Yongle goods at 7 yuan, Xiankang at 6.5 yuan, Lianhua at 6.4 yuan, Hualun at 8 yuan, Yingji No. 1 at 7.25 yuan, and No. 2 at 6.75 yuan. Woolen fabrics for lower garments, such as printed woolens, rotten woolens, and Melton, were all very sluggish in demand and sales. Since the increase in tariffs, costs have suddenly increased, causing spot prices to suddenly soar. The small and large plaid rotten woolens that were sold for 1.1-2 yuan last year are now being sold by the industry for 2.25 yuan to 2.75 yuan. Compared with the new and old tariffs, the asking price is still flat. After all, the new goods of more than 2 yuan cannot reach the cost. There is a surge in the arrival of Melton goods, and old stocks are flooding the market. Those who have goods are selling at low prices. Yesterday, Taihe goods opened at 2.6 jiao and Guquanlong 2.5 jiao, and 豐 Yuanfeng opened at 2.55 jiao. It was found that the new and old goods of more than 2 yuan of rotten printed woolen fabrics are not many in stock. Those who hold the goods do not care about price reductions.</p>

<h3 id="e220">How to Remedy the Mental Illnesses of Young People <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— Pu</p>
<p>Reading Mr. Erchu's "The Greatest Enemy of Young People's Psychology" in this publication, I cannot help but feel moved. Originally, I had been thinking about this issue for a long time and wanted to talk about it, but because the matter is significant, I dared not discuss it rashly. Now that someone has already talked about it first and hopes to arouse resonance, I will also "attach myself to the end" and say a few words, contributing a little humble opinion.</p>
<p>Upon investigation, the reason why young people have psychological problems is, of course, that they do not have a firm will or accurate rationality. However, the other aspects of family, school, and society cannot be held responsible, because the good or bad environment, the completeness or lack of education, and the righteousness or wickedness of the career are all greatly related to the psychology of young people. Now, how to remedy the psychological problems of young people? Naturally, simply saying that young people should extricate themselves and how to save themselves will probably be difficult to achieve effective results. At the very least, it is necessary to unite the family, school, and society in various aspects, dividing labor and cooperating in order to achieve even a slight effect.</p>
<p>(1) Young people themselves:</p>
<p>A. Understand the responsibility of being a "person" and determine one's own "outlook on life."</p>
<p>B. Organize one's own thoughts and develop a logical mind.</p>
<p>C. Forge one's own will and strive for the goals to be achieved.</p>
<p>D. Embrace a spirit of perseverance and excellence to cope with adverse environments.</p>
<p>E. Sanction improper desires and recognize that "personality" and "knowledge" are the weapons to transform everything. F. Resist all inherited forces and establish one's own life.</p>
<p>G. Develop a spirit of mutual assistance to unite and support other young people.</p>
<p>(2) Family aspect:</p>
<p>A. Provide appropriate guidance on the lives of young people.</p>
<p>B. Give young people the right to freedom of marriage.</p>
<p>C. Recognize that young people have a considerable position in the family.</p>
<p>D. Encourage young people to develop independent abilities.</p>
<p>(3) School aspect:</p>
<p>A. Promote vocational education so that young people who cannot further their studies have the skills to make a living. B. Implement mass education so that out-of-school young people have the opportunity to acquire knowledge. C. Focus on sex education so that young people do not go astray.</p>
<p>D. Guide young people on various methods of self-cultivation.</p>
<p>E. Find ways to improve the poor environment of young people.</p>
<p>(4) Social aspect:</p>
<p>A. Develop production businesses to accommodate the surplus of young people in the workforce.</p>
<p>B. Reform the private property system so that the environment for young people is gradually equalized.</p>
<p>C. Eliminate all inherited forces that bind the thoughts of young people in religion and customs. D. Organize legitimate entertainment venues so that young people have suitable leisure activities.</p>
<p>E. Establish a youth savings bank to cultivate young people's savings habits.</p>
<p>F. Establish a youth unemployment agency to prevent young people from drifting and falling.</p>
<p>G. Publish youth publications to take on the responsibility of guidance and assistance.</p>
<p>H. Hold public lectures on ethics and academics to awaken young people from time to time.</p>
<p>Dear young people! The youth problem is related to the entire problem of society. I am very ashamed to ask myself that I have not conducted detailed observations on the practical aspects of society. Now, due to the limited space, the remedy plan is written very simply, and there are bound to be many superficial points. Please do not hesitate to add to the discussion.</p>
<h3 id="e221">Tricks in the Evening <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— Tu Ma</p>
<p>I remember there are two old poems, "The sunset is infinitely good, it's just near dusk", one sentence describes the beauty of the sunset, and the other sentence laments that after the sunset, it will be dark. But when the weather is hot, especially in Shanghai, where there are many people in small houses, they are oppressed by the heat all day long, as if they are trapped in a steamer. They have no money and no good fortune to escape the summer. They only hope that the violent sun will set earlier. What else are they interested in seeing the scenery of the sunset? And I hope that a rain and a few gusts of wind will make everyone feel refreshed. What mood do they have to care about darkness and light?</p>
<p>The foundation of life is built on money, which is a fact that everyone cannot deny. The performers, of course, cannot escape this example. They rely on a few sets of "deceptive tricks" to find some money to maintain their food and clothing, as well as the lives of "dogs and monkeys". Taking advantage of the late day and the slight breeze, they lead the dogs and monkeys, carry wooden boxes on their backs, and honestly and impolitely hang up a few "masks" and run to the streets to develop their way to make money.</p>
<p>At this time, many people are sitting and standing by the roadside wall. Although the heat has not subsided, these people are already preparing to enjoy the coolness that nature gives them. If there is a larger open space nearby, then it is regarded as the "Kuling of the laborers", the "Qingdao, Mogan Mountain for the poor". Regardless of men, women, old and young, they all go to the open space to rest and cool off until late at night before dispersing.</p>
<p>The sound of the small gong rang loudly, and naturally many people gathered to join in the fun, forming a circle and surrounding the two performers, a dog, and a monkey in the middle to watch them perform tricks.</p>
<p>The dog and the monkey began to work. "The dog walks in circles", and the monkey is already wearing a red cloth shirt, but unfortunately he is not wearing trousers. At this time, the performer gave an order, and the dog walked even faster. "The monkey also puts on a mask" and a "broken gauze hat" on his head, vividly playing the old tricks of what the common saying calls "dressed beasts", which only made a group of ignorant and uneducated children happy to dance.</p>
<p>The sky gradually darkened, and the performer's bag was filled with a lot of copper coins. He excitedly led the dog and the monkey away. I only heard the people who were cooling off say: The dog and the monkey were only willing to listen to the performer's orders because of the "problem of food". To teach the monkey to perform tricks, you must first "kill the chicken to show the monkey". The monkey is afraid of death, so he learns it. However, the dog and the monkey do not understand what tricks they are learning and doing, "just being manipulated by others".</p>
<h3 id="e222">What Kind of Logic Is This? <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Ben</p>
<p>Mosquitoes buzzed, their wings fluttering as they formed ranks and began their campaign of aggression. It was a hot summer evening, and the bedroom was simply unbearable due to their disturbances. Left with no choice, I temporarily emulated Young Marshal Zhang's policy of non-resistance and retreated from the entire bedroom, seeking coolness on the street outside the gate, temporarily avoiding their onslaught.</p>
<p>Once outside, the streetlights shone with a brilliance like a painting. These ferocious and cruel Red Bandits (mosquitoes – full of red terror), dared not brazenly launch a full-scale attack, but instead covertly broke into smaller units to steal some vitamins from behind.</p>
<p>What? What is this? Why are these people rushing westward, some with tense expressions? Could there be a fire somewhere? But I don't hear anyone shouting "Fire!" What exactly is going on? A quick look would reveal the answer; what need is there to overthink it, idiot? So, I stood up and aimlessly followed the crowd. After walking past a dozen or so storefronts, I gleaned from their discussions that the local Public Security Bureau had just caught four opium offenders on East Street, and they were about to be interrogated immediately, and the crowd was going to watch the proceedings. Arresting opium users is a common occurrence, what's so interesting about that? But in this 18th-century town, novelty is rare.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>After dinner, with no movie theaters to provide entertainment, going to watch the opium offenders being interrogated wasn't necessarily a bad way to pass the time, so their actions should be forgiven.</p>
<p>"Are you selling opium?" "Officer, I wouldn't dare sell it!" "Nonsense! There are four opium pipes and a jar of opium. The evidence is irrefutable, how dare you deny it?" "Yes..." "Why do you three smoke opium?" ("Officer, we wouldn't dare smoke it!" "You've been caught red-handed, how dare you quibble?" "Yes, yes, yes...") I stood in the crowd and heard this exchange. At the same time, I craned my neck to look inside and saw four bloodless killing devices (opium lamps) and a black-stained ceramic jar on the table. Presumably, it contained the utterly evil opium. The interrogation of the opium offenders was swift. Look, they’d all confessed with just a few words from each of them.</p>
<p>"These four addicts have been caught red-handed, their confessions are clear, so the Public Security Bureau will, according to the law, detain them for a maximum of twenty-four hours, and undoubtedly transfer them to the court tomorrow. The outcome will likely be a sentence of at least three months to a year of imprisonment for each of them. Given their long-standing habits, their punishment might even be more severe. It seems everyone should be law-abiding and not commit crimes, knowing that as the saying goes, 'The prince who breaks the law is judged the same as a commoner.' The majesty and sanctity of the law cannot be circumvented by anyone!" A person thought to themself on the way home.</p>
<p>The next day, going out into the street, what a surprise! How come the four opium offenders arrested by the Public Security Bureau last night have already been released? They are still walking around on the street, not going to court at all? The limits of legal judgment that I speculated about in my mind on the way home last night are absolutely contrary to reality. Has the law lost its authority and effectiveness? Otherwise, why would these four opium offenders who were caught red-handed with irrefutable confessions be free and not subject to legal judgment? Truly strange!</p>

<p>Landscape by Mr. Yu Xiaolian (Brief Biography)</p>
<p>Yu Xiaolian is a native of Songjiang, Jiangsu. He possessed innate talent in calligraphy and painting, and by the age of thirteen, he had already astonished his elders. The epigrapher Fei Longding especially valued him, treating him like a young friend, frequently visiting him for discussions and enjoyment, which furthered his artistic progress. His landscape paintings are reminiscent of Dong Yuan, Ju Ran, and the Four Wangs, while his figures and flower paintings are inspired by Chen Hongshou and Xu Wei. Longding presented him with a poem containing the line, "Who can continue the Huating school of painting? Clouds and mists arise before his eyes from Ruifeng," which is indeed a fitting compliment. This particular painting slightly incorporates the strength and elegance of Huang Gongwang's style, and his knowledge of epigraphy and poetry is also quite refined.</p>

<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Middle-aged man: What's there to be afraid of? Even if we don't burn it ourselves, the Japanese soldiers will burn it.</p>
<p>Child: Great, the planes are gone, we can go out now.</p>
<p>Old woman: Let's hide for a little longer, they might come back.</p>
<p>Old man: (Coming out of the cave first) Hmph, I managed to hide and avoid death again. In times like these, alas, it's better to be dead!</p>
<p>(The people in the cave come out one after another, the woman holding a child in her arms, and leading another larger one.)</p>
<p>Woman: Alright, let's go back, I wonder if the wheat bran is burnt.</p>
<p>(The one she is leading refuses to go, because he sees someone pasting paper on the wall, and there is also a soldier posting a notice. The woman goes alone.</p>
<p>Child: Mom, I'll go in a little while.</p>
<p>(The soldier finishes posting the notice on the temple wall and leaves, everyone gathers around to look. One of them reads it slowly.)</p>
<p>Middle-aged man: "Resisting Japan and killing the enemy is the Central Government's top priority. Not only saving the country, but loving the villagers. Killing the enemy to achieve results, disregarding death. Fighting hard day and night, the enemy's morale is faltering. The people love and protect them, offering baskets of food and pots of drink. Discipline is strict, not disturbing the locals. Unanimously supporting, enhancing national glory..."</p>
<p>Old man: What is it talking about, I can't understand a word.</p>
<p>Middle-aged man B: I don't understand either. Hey! (Asking the one reading the notice) Is this a notice from our Chinese government? Does it mention airplanes?</p>
<p>Middle-aged man: No.</p>
<p>Middle-aged man B: Then the southern soldiers? Does it mention whether they are coming or not?</p>
<p>Middle-aged man: No.</p>
<p>Old man: Then what exactly does this notice say?</p>
<p>Middle-aged man: Didn't I read it? It says how good the Central Government's soldiers are. But I don't understand what that means.</p>
<p>Old woman: The Japanese soldiers also dropped a lot of leaflets from the planes, saying how good they are. Everyone says they are good, but I don't know who to believe.</p>
<p>Middle-aged man: No matter what, saying it's good is useless. Whichever army is really willing to fight the Japanese desperately is a good army. We don't need them to teach us to support them, and we will naturally support them. Grandpa! (pointing at the old man) Are you right? As long as they don't make us slaves to a foreign country, we are willing to do anything.</p>
<p>Old man: Isn't that right? Since the Republic, there have been years of chaos and war, we have suffered so many disasters, and now if they are really willing to fight foreigners, what's wrong with suffering again?</p>
<p>Middle-aged man C: If we're not contributing to the country, then Heaven must have no eyes. For example, yesterday I wasn't at home, and one of my donkeys and a mule were taken by the soldiers to transport things. If I were at home, of course I would have gone with them. Now who knows where they went? But my whole family relies on these two animals to make a living. I waited all afternoon in one area, hoping they would come back so I could take them back. But they still haven't come back, it's driving me crazy.</p>

<h3 id="e225">The Defensive Line of British Films <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Zu</p>
<p>Absorption and Renovation of the Nanking Theater</p>
<p>The dominance of American films in the Chinese market undoubtedly sparked strong resistance from German films. In every major city in China, we see the invasion and activity of German films. At the same time, British films are also closely following, introducing several "British Style" song and dance films one after another, such as "Camp Meeting," "Happy Go Lucky," and "Nightingale." However, British films did not have a sufficient outlet behind them, and relying on theaters could not achieve satisfactory development. Therefore, they used their skills and leased the Nanking Theater, which occupies a corner of the Meiersi Ai Road, forming the first defensive line.</p>
<p>The agent for British films is British Films Company. They have a considerable understanding with domestic filmmakers. Several famous film companies have signed long-term contracts, continuously supplying them with films that they believe suit the tastes of Chinese audiences. Not only that, but they also sent a formal representative, Chang Chuan, to reside in London and be responsible for this matter. It is said that in the past two years, the development of the British film industry has indeed made significant progress, both in terms of technology and performance. They first improved the quality, followed by enriching the entertainment elements, aiming to create films with considerable entertainment connotations. The several films that have been released in this area in the past are the initial products under this standard. Of course, they hope to have more exceptional works that surpass everything that Hollywood has contributed.</p>
<p>Indeed, musical comedies from Britain have achieved great success in both domestic and foreign markets, so filmmakers are even more determined to promote "entertainment" as a slogan, increasing the production of such musicals. Coming soon to be released in this area is "Marry Me," starring Lana Morris, the star of "Happy Go Lucky," which is a lighthearted comedy. There are also two films starring Jack Hulbert, who played the old servant in "Happy Go Lucky": "Jack's the Boy" and "Hove on Wheels." His novel and humorous performance is most worthy of people's memory. Alexander Korda is a leading expert in making comedies. He specially selected two difficult-to-portray and cold-humored comedians, Roland Young and George Grossmith, to star in "Wedding Rehearsal," offering something new and special. "Rome Express" is a great all-star work, with the same significance as Hollywood's "Grand Hotel," which deserves our deep attention.</p>
<p>For the arrival of these new films, the movie palace where they will premiere, the Nanking Theater, has also undergone special internal and external renovations. The seats have been completely renovated, and the sound system uses the latest type from Western Electric. This machinery can avoid all echoes while amplifying the lowest sounds and reducing the highest sounds. Their only goal is to allow people who have worked hard to step into this movie palace and feel spiritual inspiration and inexplicable comfort.</p>

<p>"Giant Port of the East" to Hit the Screen</p>
<p>Since completing "Blood Debt," Xu Xinfu had not worked for a long time. Recently, he received a script set against the backdrop of a salt field, "Salt Tide," and immediately his tepid enthusiasm rose to a boil, and he began work. The other day, he led a team including Hu Die, Wang Xianqi, Sun Min, Gu Meijun, and others, smiling happily to Shangganpu to shoot exterior scenes. Unexpectedly, in the evening he received an urgent letter from the salt field in that area, saying that recent storms and raging waves had caused the collapse of the thatched sheds along the coast, and so everyone in the company thought they would go there full of excitement, and return with disappointment. However, yesterday the company's two cars returned, saying that as soon as they arrived in Ganpu, the storm stopped and the raging waves subsided. Therefore, Xu Xinfu, like someone with "a new lease on life after disaster," happily began working.</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3 id="e227">Review of "Pick Up" <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Generally speaking, American films are almost always produced under a fixed formula, and this is something that we can see again in "Pick Up."</p>
<p>The young woman, Mary, is implicated in a crime because of her bad husband and is imprisoned. After her ex-husband is released from prison, she is unable to maintain a living. Fortunately, she meets a young chauffeur, and through his introduction, she becomes a telephone operator at a car dealership. Later, the chauffeur, encouraged by the advice of a woman with no connections, strives to improve himself and eventually becomes the owner of a small car dealership. His life is now prosperous, unlike in the past. The chauffeur wants to marry the woman, but she refuses because she is already committed to someone else. Soon after, he begins to associate with a romantic woman. Seeing this situation, the woman decisively asks a lawyer for a divorce from her husband. The chauffeur then proposes to his romantic woman, but is also rejected. At this time, the woman's husband is released from prison and threatens to kill the chauffeur, forcing the woman to go with him. In the end, the woman cleverly reports to the police and has her divorced husband arrested. With the chauffeur's utmost help, she is able to live happily ever after with her true love.</p>
<p>In this story, it is easy to find many points that are the same as other films. In order to write about a woman who is faithful to love, it is necessary to write about the other party (the man) not being dedicated to love, being fickle, or being bewitched by another woman, so there must be a tramp appearing in the story. To write about a chaste woman changing her mind, it must be because she met the wrong person and was forced to remarry, so there must be a villainous bandit appearing in the story. Finally, to illustrate that true love between a man and a woman must be obtained through hardship, after several twists and turns, the sentimental men and women end up together under the protection of the law. This is a formula on the screen, most applicable to American films. The Tianyi Film Company in China has a new sound film called "Vitality," directed by Shao Zuiweng and starring Chen Yumei.</p>
<p>Film producers, in order to "learn from the skills of their predecessors," try their best to adopt this formula. This formula has been reflected in many works in China, and it is probably unnecessary to provide examples.</p>
<p>Some people say that American films can only circle around romance, and this is indeed a proof of the fact. However, the scope of romance is not necessarily so small. Can't they come up with some new tricks? Therefore, on the one hand, they feel a lack of subject matter to the extreme, (in fact, if the writer's life is rich, they will never have this feeling). On the other hand, they can't help but feel powerless when they repeatedly fabricate stories.</p>
<p>Because of the stale and uninteresting story, no matter how hard the director works, they cannot make this film have any value. The director's ability, at best, is that he can make the performance quite interesting, and the result is to make people laugh with the dialogue. However, the monotony of the performance is also unavoidable due to the story. In the first half, we only see the male and female protagonists walking on the screen. Even though the dialogue is funny, it cannot arouse the audience's interest. Although it becomes quite tense later on, due to the fragmented sub-scenes, it ultimately fails to organize the audience's emotions. Perhaps some small details are commendable, such as the heroine returning from her divorce with extreme joy, but unable to gain the love of her lover, the scene of the romantic woman's joy, and the heroine's clever reporting to the police, but in the end, it cannot obtain its special value because of this.</p>
<p>Sylvia Sidney received a lot of praise from Chinese people for playing "Madame Butterfly," but like the director, she could not maintain her past achievements in this film. Of course, the tone of "Pick Up" and "Madame Butterfly" are completely different, but the personality of the character she plays is still not much different. It can be seen that actors cannot succeed in the same range.</p>
<p>As an aside, this work did not receive good reviews in Japan either. The film title was translated as "Pavement," which is certainly not as tempting as the Chinese translation, but I wonder if it is appropriate to translate it directly as "Choice"?</p>
<h3 id="e228">On the Popularization of Cinema <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— Ren Ying</p>
<p>The popularization of cinema is truly shouted loudly this year, while at the same time the popularization of cinema is also misunderstood by the general public. And the starting point of why cinema should be popularized, there are roughly two reasons: (1) To rely on cinema to educate the public, to supplement the inadequacy of public education. (2) To bring the painful moans of the times to the screen, so that people know what kind of era it is now. This is like the popularization of literature and art, so that the ladies and wives of the city, after watching sweet and loving romance films, are instilled with images of the suffering masses, or to change their tastes.</p>
<p>Regarding the popularization of cinema, many people have published theories in this area in the past. In fact, the popularization of cinema is not about the national film industry unanimously mobilizing and specializing in using popular themes to describe popular films. Otherwise, it is not possible in practice, and such work is also unnecessary. Popular films only need to be able to move people; this is more powerful than words. In short, popular films should use the consciousness of the times to shout out the moans of the masses. Or educate the public and give them a new inspiration.</p>
<p>I remember a certain film publication, regarding the popularization of cinema, once published a satire that was as humorous as George Bernard Shaw. It said: "If the popularization of cinema is suitable for the present, we can call the bums on the road to be actors. And compile scripts such as 'The Love History of a Rickshaw Puller', 'The Scandalous History of a Thatched Shed', etc..." (Because the original text is not available, I remember it roughly as above.) I think these are not only groundless satires from a certain film publication, or they can be considered a misunderstanding. This is still the general misunderstanding of the popularization of cinema today. We certainly hope that the popularization of cinema can achieve the effect of educating the public in the future; it is not about turning the lives of the public into decadent lives, and moving it to the screen. I hope that friends who study the popularization of cinema will have a strong response.</p>

<p>Chen Yumei's records released by Baidai Company. There are "Lullaby", "Swallows Fly in Pairs", "Flowers Tease the Shadow", "Frugality Song", "For Modern Misses", etc. Because Chen Yumei's singing has a quiet and gentle charm, which is very different from others. Therefore, there are many people who welcome it. The sales of records are therefore excellent. It is now heard that the new sound film "Vitality" produced by Tianyi and starring Chen Yumei has three new songs in the film. One is "Little Baby". One is "Butterfly and Bee". One is "New Lullaby." Now, the first new song "Little Baby" has also been recorded by Baidai Company and has already begun to be released.</p>

<p>— Ma Zhan</p>
<p>Sheridan and Easton were arguing indecisively when they heard the door of the opposite bedroom open. Eve Lowell was humming the lyrics of "Romeo and Juliet" and walking out quickly. Sheridan hurried after her, but when he saw her, he didn't get a chance to give her the money in the envelope. She just kept talking about her infatuation with Easton, saying she didn't have time and wanted to plan her future collaboration with Easton alone. She said it wasn't because Easton's position in the theater was high now, but she really wanted to help him because she thought Easton was too good. After she finished speaking, she held out her hand to say goodbye to Sheridan and left. Sheridan stood there blankly for a while and then left, unwilling to see Easton for the time being.</p>
<p>Like a happy dream, wings sprout and fly to the highest clouds; but when the dream wakes and disappears, what you feel is the stinging pain in your chest. The wings are also broken, beating in the piercing cold wind, and pitifully must eventually fall. At first, Eve was stubbornly unwilling to believe she would be disappointed, but long-term starvation and cold forced her to accept the theory of fate. But she can still try to move forward, holding her head high, her eyes facing upwards, enduring the pain of the new wounds on her heart, still wanting to chase the fleeting hope. As for Easton, this matter has also been left behind with Eve's disappearance. All the things that don't go through the heart are forgotten after a while. The days pass quickly, the rehearsal date for "Blue Sky" is coming to an end, and "Golden Branch" is being rehearsed. Rita Vernon haughtily looks down on everything. Her friends, who usually flatter her, compliment her every day, telling her that the success of "Blue Sky" is entirely due to her outstanding talent, and that she should receive double the salary and a portion of the surplus profits. She believed this deeply, waiting for the opportunity to come. She knew that Sheridan was against her playing the lead role in "Golden Branch," but</p>
<p>She forced Easton to give her the lead role. Sheridan knew that Rita didn't understand the plot and was afraid that it wouldn't be easy to fool the audience, but Rita's absolute confidence made him helpless. Rita's sudden outburst made her despise all standards of comparison, thinking she was the only great female lead of her time. She now saw that a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity had arrived. She had made a plan in her mind, waiting for the first night of the opening of "Golden Branch" so that she could propose her conditions to Easton, forcing Easton to admit it, so that he would be caught off guard and had no choice but to surrender unconditionally. When she was arranging this, she did not think that Sheridan had already made preparations. During the rehearsal process of "Golden Branch," Sheridan watched silently from the sidelines. Rita completely ignored his instructions. Her identity was completely inconsistent with the identity of the character in the play. While Sheridan lamented that the plot could not be developed faithfully, he was thinking of finding a suitable lead and rearranging "Golden Branch." (To be continued)</p>
