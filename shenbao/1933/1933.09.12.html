<h3>江蘇之海塘　　元</h3>
<p>昔人言治黃河以安内。築海塘以禦外。治内者疏滯而使之達。禦外者思患</p>
<p>而豫爲防。從事於治水者。本皆主先内後外况今年黃河之出險。禍延三省。損失之鉅不可計數。而海塘之出險。僅及祟明川沙南匯等數縣。以之比較黃患則甚微。故皆一致注意於治黃。而不及防海。但海塘出險。實爲江浙富庶之區之最大禍患。歴朝皆重視此舉。苟不思患豫防。一旦大險猝至。必將不堪收拾。蓋已有先例可徵也。</p>
<p>禹貢言入海而不防海之入。孟子言注海而不防海之注。迨至唐宋。而始言防海。唐開元元年。始見築塘捍海之名。宋紹興乾道時。劉保邱祟先後修繕。明亦迭次增築。歷成化以至嘉萬。規　漸備。至遜淸因險工屢出。更大加修理。如朱軾李衛陳宏謀陶澍林則徐輩。越數年或數十年。舉大工一次。最後同光間丁日昌撫蘇時。又以塘工坍毀。日益加甚。曾大修一次。其工歷二十年始竣。由是海患稍安。迄今又將閱五十年矣。雖時有修治。然皆零星小工。示嘗舉行大工一次。則今日塘工之危險。亦意中事也。</p>
<p>中國瀕海之省有七。然如遼寗河北山東廣東福建等省。皆未聞築塘以禦海。而江浙獨以海塘聞。江浙海塘。又以形勢變易。獨趨重於江蘇。江蘇各縣之有海塘者。爲金山松江（即從前之華亭）奉賢南匯川沙寳山太倉及合併於。太倉常熟之鎭洋昭文等。岸長亘五百餘里。而此有海塘之各縣中。以於江寳山爲最險。太倉及鎭洋昭文次之。松江之險。以有金勝諸山故。寳山太倉之險。以有崇寳諸沙故。水性扼則愈怒。逼則益肆。故其潮之來而襲也。有稽天之勢。其退而吸也。有拔山之力。老於塘工者謂塘有三懼。曰衝曰激曰旋折。潮挾此三者之力量以攻塘。不啻龍王挾大砲巨彈以轟炸塘。苟非有相敵之勢力以爲防禦。則不足以禦此外侮。故歷代之政府與地方官庚。皆不惜竭人力財力。以經營塘工。其研究所以鞏固海塘之法。亦日益周密。然而海潮之衝激旋折。日侵月蝕。無異旦旦之伐。故工程縱極堅固。石塘土塘以及護塘之椿欄水之壩。縱極完備。而數年或數十年之後。未有不被攻擊而動搖者。今各地海塘。已日見頽窳。險象迭出。則大舉修塘。不容稍緩矣。</p>
<p>夫築塘禦海。所以助地拒水。非與水爭地也。助地拒水。而常若不勝者。豈與水勢之不可抗歟。抑亦人事之有所未盡耳。築塘禦海。歷來皆視爲最佳之方法。故皆致力於此。率由舊章。而不稍改變。每次工程。能較上次爲堅牢。規模較上次宏遠者。已爲不可多得之盛舉。然而其效力所及。亦僅至數十年止。今者科學昌明。技術進步。築隄修壩及一切治水之工程學。皆已超越於數十年前之舊法。苟能捨棄牢守舊法之見解。集中人材物力。以進行此舉。吾知其必能戰勝水勢。而有以奠定此百年之大計也。然而今日之中國。但知頭痛救頭。脚痛醫脚。見黃可之禍顯而急。則一致大呼治黃。見海塘之禍隱而緩。則相率掉頭不顧。即使極力呼籲。幸而動工。亦不過零星小修而已。何能望如從前之大舉興修。更何能望改絃更張。作一勞永逸之計乎。</p>
<p>然而江蘇人萬不能漠視此事。前數日黃河之水。雖延及蘇省北部。而被害尙微。近日海塘雖出險。而所傷不過數千人。損失亦僅數十百萬。誠我江蘇人之大幸。但禍害之來。常不可測。一旦大風挾巨浪而來。朽衰頽之塘。不能抵敵。則其崩潰之禍。豈小於黃河之泛濫乎。高一濫乎。高一涵委員會曾一度赴塘調查迄未聞有何舉動。殆以在此百孔千瘡之情勢下。無暇顧慮及此耳。其實爲思患豫防計。江蘇人實不應忽視之也。</p>

<h3>浦東陸家渡大火</h3>
<p>＝紹酒燒去八千餘甏損失三萬金＝</p>
<p>＝康記酒作坊未保火險創鉅痛深＝</p>
<p>浦東陸家渡高木橋浜南十四號門牌康記酒作坊棧房、忽於昨晚七時一刻、發生大火、焚燒約二小時、將草房三十六間瓦房十八間、大部分付之一炬、所餘瓦房數間、亦一併爬平、損失三萬餘金、茲將被燬詳情、紀載於下、</p>
<h3>酒作坊歷史</h3>
<p>該酒作坊自開設迄今已有數年之歷史、起初範圍甚小、後因逐年營業發達、遂陸續租購地基、擴充棧房、現下共有草棧房三十六間、瓦棧房十八間、棧内均係堆積製成之紹興酒、達一萬甏之多、其棧房建造形式、草房共分三埭、每埭十二間、位於瓦房之東、均係朝南開門、瓦房則造於西面、南北接連一埭、係朝東開門、草房之南、尙餘空地、則爲堆存空甏之用、</p>
<h3>火燒兩小時</h3>
<p>昨日下午七時一刻、中埭草棧房内、突然起火、因棧屋材料、均以毛竹與稻草編成、着火卽燃、霎時透穿屋項、火熖直沖天空、遠至數里外、均能看見、當該管三區二所派駐附近崗警回所報警、由楊所長督同孫湯二巡官、率領長警、馳至火塲彈壓、一面商由附近熒昌火柴廠孫廠長同意、將該廠自備水亭開放、銜接四百五十尺長皮帶、通至火塲灌救、同時東昌路浦東區救火會、亦派帮浦車趕到奮力灌救、但火勢猛烈、加之東風甚緊、一時殊難撲滅、未半小時、前後兩埭草棧房、均已波及焚燬、而西首緊靠草房之瓦棧房、亦連續着火、焚燒至大半、尙餘數間、則被人力拖倒、以免再行蔓延、燒至八時許、火勢始衰、但救火員仍恐餘燼復燃、仍灌救不輟、熒昌廠共灌水七八千加倫、惟救火會係自浜内取水、難以計算、直救至九時半許、見火勢全熄、始行停止、</p>
<h3>四鄰之驚惶</h3>
<p>當火起後、該作坊南首垃圾塘一帶、均係江北草棚、爲數甚多、一般江北居民、正當晚餐之際、突見起火、莫不驚慌異常、一時扶老携糼、紛紛奔逃、所有家具、大都搬於西首熒昌廠附近曠地上、大哭小啼、狀甚紊亂、而各處觀火者、均紛紛至沓來、擁擠不堪、幸三區二所長警維持得力、三區張區長亦親自督警到塲保護、故未發生事故、而火勢始終並未越出該作坊週圍籬笆之外、致四面鄰屋得未波及、尙係大幸、否則更不堪設想矣、</p>
<h3>損失三萬餘</h3>
<p>是役該作坊这所有焚燬及拖倒之房屋、共計瓦草房五十四間、内堆紹酒一萬甏、燒燬約八千餘甏、平均每甏成本約大洋二元七角、甏價損失每只大洋五角、總數幾三萬金、草房三十六間、瓦房十八間、約値五千金、總計全部損失三萬五千金之鉅實爲該作坊開設以來空前之浩刦、經此大禍之後、受創已深、一時恐難恢復舊觀、</p>
<h3>原因未查明</h3>
<p>三區二所楊中權所長、於火熄後、飭警將該坊賑房王祖廷帶所研訉起火原因、據王供稱、年三十八歲、寗波人、服務該作坊多年、平日棧房内無人居住、故起火原因、尙難明暸、惟並未保有火險云云、所長獲供、以火因未明、續派警士將火塲鄰居四十五號·四十六號·居民海門人施繼華·紹興人朱玉山·兩人傳所作證、均稱火起時、正在吃晚飯、比走出門口、見火熖已冒出屋項等語、所長以究竟因何起火、未有線索、候今日續傳該坊工頭老司務等人證、再行研究、一面飭將該賑房暫留所内、再候發落、並於當晚備文報告總局情報處鑒核、</p>

<h3>英國惠勃爾登世界綱球大會日記（十）</h3>
<p>倫敦特約通信一志寄</p>
<p>七月七日星期五</p>
<p>偉大錦標之决賽、五盤才分勝負、爲例外不常見者、一般皆僅三盤或四盤耳、且精彩不多、但至少有二塲歷史上可紀念之比賽、則全屬相反、一九一六年、李却威廉士在林山擊敗瓊斯敦、其第五盤、曾以零比三落後而反勝、不少觀衆之意見、皆謂爲從未獲見之最好網球、今日則澳洲雪梨之克勞福、擊敗上屆冠軍及目下之全美冠軍梵恩斯、亦以五盤才分勝負、二人皆表演從來未見之最好網球、二人難解難分、各勝兩盤、復各勝四局、座客咸曰此比賽應及此而止、庶幾兩人皆不損其光榮也、</p>
<p>梵恩斯（右）克勞福（左）决賽前之合影</p>
<p>球場上之情景、皆满意非凡、氣候温和、陽光輝耀、薄有微風、中央塲人山人海、熊度甚佳、而視線員亦可满意、唯一之失誤、爲一次梵恩斯之抽球、擊出底線至少二吋、未曾呌出、裁判員之請求靜聲、幾成單調、常須等候一二秒鐘、再呌其判决也、座客中之希望產生一英國冠軍、熱烈異常、蓋自柏德生後、迄今已十有一年矣、擁護克勞福之鼓掌聲震雲霄、及勝負旣决、蹝跳者有之、狂呼者有之、满天飛帽、婦女哭笑皆非、竟至暈倒、有謂克勞福夫人、亦在其内、</p>
<p>雙方皆表示至上之運動精神、在雙方數局之後、二人極安靜前行、至裁判員之椅旁、取巾拭汗、旣無恐懼、亦無羞辱、</p>
<p>女子雙打之後、兩人徐步上塲、梵恩斯曾在外塲與麥斯加爾作活動練習、克勞福亦然、嗣乃同時登塲、克勞福帶一汗巾、兩人皆满捧球拍、克轉拍得先發球權、五盤之中、如一盤完結之局數爲雙數者、則克仍保持此先發球權、</p>
<p>梵恩斯以六比四、先勝第一盤、五比二後復勝其發球局、第二盤、常屢次進攻、皆爲克勞福所力阻、克漸漸能探制其對手之砲彈發球、繼而常見其擊破之、有時見其球着網拍卽已中止、有時則見球一回而去、如此　續、直到至比賽終結、梵恩斯發球之得分、亦逐漸减少、克勞福除此偉大之控制發球外、其自信力亦逐漸増加、其地位亦進至底線内三呎至五呎、此不啻爲法國三劍客拉柯斯德及柯顯等破除鐡爾登砲彈發球之重演、克勞福旣逐漸穩定、同時梵恩斯卽開始動搖、　　克勞福之第一得勝原因、卽在其流暢及堅實之回球、除非毫無辦法、未有不將球擊回者、梵恩斯自然大失所望、不得傾全力於發球、初果成功、及克勞福回復其力、其成功乃隨之下降、第二盤第十二局中、錯誤重重、竟至不起、第三盤又屬史勞福、第四盤則梵恩斯、第五盤成各二之後、嚴重之局勢乃見、梵恩斯失誤一次空中壓球、竟送去此重要之一局、否則局面殆將大變、此後克勞福形勢遂穩定而一帆風順矣、（七月七日未完）</p>

<h3>查爾的百处誕辰</h3>
<p>— 郁達夫</p>
<p>提起查爾（Ｆｅｒｄｉｎａｎｄ　ｖｏｎ　Ｓａａｒ）這一個名字，或者大家都會感覺到奇異，因爲在中國的文藝刋物，或譯叢裏，是不大看得到的生名。這原也是不得已的事情。莫說中國，就是外國文學翻譯介紹得最多最雜的英美，恐怕也不見得有一册查爾的作品的翻譯。但在德國，尤其是他的故鄉的奥國理，則不但在他的死後，就是在生前，已經爲幾個有識的批評家所推崇，許爲可知ＧｏｔｔｆｒｉｅｄＫｅｌｌｅｒ，Ｔｅｈｏｄｏｒ　Ｓｔｏｒｍ等並立的一流不朽作家了。</p>
<p>查爾於一八三三年九月三十日生在一家維也納的貴族的家裏。雖然是一家由官吏起家的貴族人家，但大半都是廉吏的奥國的這家宦家，財產却是没有的；因此查爾爲生計所迫，年少的時候，就入了軍籍，以資糊口。一八六零年，他厭倦了軍隊生活，且爲自已的内心衝動所激盪，雖然明知道文筆謀生活的不可靠，但也毅然决然地退出了軍隊，開始來做文士。當時奥國的對文士的待遇，恐怕比到現在的中國，還要差些，查爾若没有Ｅｌｉｓａｂｅｔｈ　Ｓａｌｍ候爵夫人和Ｊｏｓｅｐｂｉｎｅ　ｖｏｎ　Ｗｅｒｔｈｅｉｍｓｔｉｅｎ的兩位貴婦人的保護，則他早也就餓死在屋頂底下了。做了許多詩和詩劇，寫了許多輪廓並不偉大的哀艷凄淸，情調絕人的短篇小說，他直到六十歲的高齡，纔獲得了一部分的批評家的贊譽。奥國政府爲表揚國家詩人的功績起見，且任命他做了貴族院的議員，這當然是大劇作家Ｇｒｉｌｌｐａｒｚｅｒ以來所絕無僅有的國家特典。</p>
<p>到了七十三歲（一九零六）的七月二十三，久爲癌病所苦，獨身到老的這位孤獨的大詩人，竟於早晨出去散步回來之後，用手槍自殺了。他的全集十二卷，装成四册，是萊府的Ｍａｘ　Ｈｅｓｓｅ所發行，頭上有Ａｎｔｏｎ　Ｂｅｔｔｅｌｅｈｉｍ的一篇詳傳附印在那裏。</p>
<p>他自已以爲他的詩和劇是最得意的作品，但他的不朽的盛名，顯然是依存在他的幾十篇短短的小說上的無疑。關於他的作品的介紹，當另撰專文，在這裏只傳述了一個極粗的生涯骨格，以誌景慕。</p>
<h3>「只有死是一椿利益」</h3>
<p>— 窳君</p>
<p>在一所學校的敎員休息室裏，人雖然很多，談笑的却只有幾個。那些都是湖南人，湖南人素來是至死不變的操着鄉音的，語調特别高，又愛爭着說話，旁邊的人想要參加些意見，似乎也無從參加，往往變成怔怔的，默默的。在這怔怔默默之羣中，有一個三十上下的人，穿着不整齊的西装，鬍鬚永遠無法肅淸，蒙蒙茸茸罩着一張黑瘦的臉，下顎有些向外突出，於是兩排牙齒失掉了平衡，下齒劍戟森森地預備向上反攻，上齒拚命的抵抗。有人過來介紹了，「這是同鄉彭家煌君」，我才知道他也是湖南人。握手寒喧之後，他低着頭用粉筆在檯布上機械地畫着，依然是怔怔的，默默的。</p>
<p>有一天，偶然在火車站遇見了他，他跑過來了。</p>
<p>「ＸＸ現在什麽地方呢」？</p>
<p>「在上海」。</p>
<p>「生活仍然很困難吧」？</p>
<p>「是的」。</p>
<p>「爲什麽不賣文呢」？</p>
<p>「也很難，材料才能和銷路都不是容易的事。····」</p>
<p>火車鳴過汽笛了，他怱怱地告别上車。「是的，他正在賣文呢」。我想。</p>
<p>從此以後，敎員休息室裏許久看不見他，問過他熟悉的人，說他感到很無聊，辭職了。那時候在那裏的人好像都感到很無聊，可是大家都没有辭職。</p>
<p>日子一長久，他的影子在我的腦裏漸漸地淡下去，忘却了。有一天突然在報紙上看見他被捕的消息，却大吃一驚。罪名重得可怕，其實這類的罪名，像流行病細菌一樣，逐日在人間浮游着，誰撞到誰倒霉，不過撞到了他的頭上，覺得總有些異樣。熟人們很替他担心，他却逃過了細菌的侵略似的逃脫了死神的手。此後，我和他消息便隔絶了。</p>
<p>直到今年，有一天猛克從外面回來，向我說，「你認識彭煌麽」？</p>
<p>「認識的」。</p>
<p>「他和我談到你，要來看你呢」！</p>
<p>「唔」。</p>
<p>八月下旬的一日，我還没有起床，有一個客人來訪，接見了，却正是彭家煌君。西装整潔了些，其餘的像從前一樣，没有多大的變化，不過臉不再黑，白起來了，那慘白使人感到凄楚。彼此談到别後的狀况，正談得高興，另外一個朋友來了，他又變成怔怔默默的，終於坐不下去走了。</p>
<p>過了幾天，猛克又來告訴我，說他生了病，狠沉重；我想，我得去看他，不知怎的，近來只是懶懶的，讓日子偷偷地過去，一直到得到他的死耗。</p>
<p>兩星期前，他不是坐在我現在坐的這張椅上麽？不是還在談過去的夢，未來的夢麽？然而現在他死了！他寫了一生的文字，大家對於他的名字都很熟悉，但是没有人談到他的作品，没有贊美，也没有指摘，如果這是寂寞，他便在寂莫裏工作着，又在寂莫裏死去了！我想到他的夢，想到那天猛克拿了爲他速寫的小照來，他看了說，「很像，很像，」只是太可怕，太可怕了」！朋友，怕什麽呢？你大槪還不知道你終竟要到的地方就在眼前呵！</p>
<p>柴霍甫在洛斯奇爾的提琴裏說，「人死至少有一椿利益，可以不吃不喝，不納稅，不損害别人了；况且人睡在墳墓裏不止一年，可以睡千年萬年；千年萬年不吃不喝，不納稅，不害人，這筆利益多麽大呵」！然而洛斯奇是爲人家做棺材，爲老婆做棺材，同時在他所憎惡的猶太人樂隊裏拉提琴生活的，到臨死的時候，他不能不想：「一生就這麽過去了，没有一點利益，没有一點满足，什麽事都糊裏糊塗過去了，什麽都不曾留住」。於是，柴霍甫太息了：「總而言之，人的生命是一椿損失，只有死却是一椿利益。！這個意思雖然很不錯，究竟是很刺心的；人生世間好歹只有一回，爲什麽世界却這樣安排，使他畢生没有好處呢」？我就用這一番話當作死者的挽歌罷！</p>
<h3>並非答辯</h3>
<p>— 樓建南</p>
<p>有人告訴我，穆先生寫了一篇文章指摘我的譯書，我就知道一定是對二十世紀的歐洲文學，因爲譯那本書的時期中，經過九一八和一二八兩個大事變，我的生活異常凌亂，但一方面爲着生活，又不能不勉强的繼續那工作，記得一九三二年一月二十九日的上午，我從北四川路的砲火巷中隻身逃出，所有的東西都丢掉，就祇帶出了那本原書。在那樣的生活中成就的工作，自然應該接受誠懇的檢查。但今天見了穆先生的文章，我就想到譯一部十餘萬字的著作固然不容許有什麽錯誤，但是寫一千多字的一篇批評，似乎也得審愼一些。例如穆先生說我Ｍｓｘｉｍ　ｄｕ　Ｋｈａｎ這譯名是杜撰的，不幸他也没注出不杜撰的原名，便硬派馬克森卡恩没有這個人，好似連原作者的茀理契，都在與我通同騙人。我知道穆先生對法國文學深有研究，爲什麽不去仔細查查，因爲至少這名字，我並非杜撰的，記得那時候，僅僅爲了找固有名詞譯音的原文，就參考了很多的書，關於卡恩，大槪是根據小說月報世界文學號下（二十週年刋）的。從這一點，想到穆先生其他的原文對照，是否一一可靠，似乎也有問題。不幸的，我甚至連找出自已的譯書和原本的餘閑也没有，好在還有許多要做的新的工作，隢隢的爲自已的過去辯護，並非必要。何况對於那譯作，我早知道是吃力不討好的工作，即使穆先生的批評不免有點魯莽，我也可以誠意接受的。</p>
<h3>愛書狂者之話</h3>
<p>— 阿英</p>
<p>在過往，有許多的愛書狂者，他們對於書籍的興味，是非常的濃厚。舊詩中，所謂「一行勤苦書千卷，」所謂「黃金散盡爲收書，」都是說這一班人愛書如何的狂熱。不過這是就有錢買書的人說。没有錢買書的却不能如此。他們有的跑到書坊裏立在那兒「揩油」讀，有的背了手對着架上的書籤發呆，有的跑上百十里路去乞憐於藏書家之門，還有的，是如郭沬若所寫，找着一個很好的機會，對自已所愛的書，來「萬引」一下，没錢的人也有没錢的辦法。這些事，散見在古籍裏的很多也很有興味，從這裏更可以看到，許多在學問上努力的人，曾經用怎樣艱苦的精神，來戰勝無書的困難。自已在學問上雖然無所成就，但這樣艱難的路，是不斷的在走着的。因此讀書時，對於這一類的事件，也特别的留意。現在，把較有意义的一部分寫述下來，成一篇「愛書狂者之話！」歡喜看這樣故事的人，在讀者中，大約總不乏其人吧。這算是「序記。」</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>明代末年，藏書最富的，在大江以南，要推錢牧齋。他有宋元精本極多。不幸，遇了一次火刦，這些書都變成刦灰，只有在東城的無恙。其間，有宋版的北宋前後漢書。牧齋買此書，僅出價三百餘金，因爲「後漢書」缺兩本，賣書的人特别减價。牧齋把這部書看得很寳貴，委托許多書賈訪求補全。其間的一個，某次停舟在烏鎭時，到岸上買麵做晚飯，麵店主人在敗簏裏拿出兩本書來作包裹，書賈看見，竟是宋版「後漢書，」而且正是牧齋缺少的兩本。他很高興，商得麵店老闆同意，化了「幾枚錢」買得。但其間的一本，，缺少第一頁，問麵店主人，說是對面的鄰人剛剛托了麵去，書賈便去對鄰，連這一頁也要了來。連夜的趕到常州，送給牧齋。牧齋欣喜欲狂，辦了很好的酒席請他吃飯，並送他二十金。這部書，到了淸初，被「居要津者」取了去。「牧齋遺事」上所載如此。</p>
<h3>淺湖（二）</h3>
<p>— 英國約瑟康拉德作侍桁譯</p>
<p>這狭窄的支流像是一條溝：蜿蜓而無底似地深邃；在那細長澄澈的靑色天蓋下，它是满充着憀暗。巨大的樹木，隱在蔓草的密網的背後，高高地耸立着。在閃光的黑水的近處，在小羊齒的草網的中間，各處可以看見大樹的歪曲的根，那是陰鬰而黑暗，寗靜而蜿蜓着，像是一條被捕的蛇。舟子的短短的話語，在豐茂薄明的草墻間，發着同聲。黑暗，從樹木間，通過蔓草的雜錯的藪叢，從奇幻靜止的大樹葉的後面，融流出來；這種黑暗，是神秘而不可見，像是那不能踏脚的漂着香氣與毒氣的森林的黑暗。</p>
<p>舟子在淺水中撑着竿，那罅口開展了，形成一片廣大的靜水湖。森林，從潮濕的岸邊後退着，讓出一片綠色的蘆草地，反映着天空的靑色。一片羊毛似的桃色的雲，漂浮在天上，在蓮花的葉子和銀色的花朶的下面，映出浮雲的微妙的色彩。建在杭木上的一間小屋，從遠處遙望是黑暗洞洞的。小屋旁，兩棵高大的棕梠樹，像是從森林的背後伸起來的，傾斜在不平的屋頂上，這多葉而聳立的樹頂的傾斜，使人看到它像是有着悲哀的心思似的。</p>
<p>舵工，用漿板指着說，「阿薩特的家就在那裏了。我看見他的船繫在杭木間。」</p>
<p>舟子們沿着船邊跑，轉臉從肩上望着他們一日旅程的終點。他們也許情願在任何處過夜，却不願在這妖氣森森而傳說有鬼的這淺水湖裏。加之，他們不喜歡阿薩特，第一因爲他是一個陌生的人，第二因爲他修理了一間破壞的房屋，便住在裏面，而且聲言他是不怕和那崇惑着這被人類棄絕的地方的精靈活在一起的。這樣的人會因爲他的眼光和話語而攪亂了命運的方向；同時他所熟識的精靈，和來往的旅客是不易和解的，他們時常都想對着過客們爲他們的主人報讐的。白種人不相信這些事體，因爲他們是異敎徒，而且和那「精主」是同盟了的，所以「精主」會使他們安全地渡過這種奇幻的土地。如有正眞的人警告他們，他們便装出不信仰的樣子。這還有什麽辦法呢？</p>
<p>舟子們撑着竿子這樣地思索着。這支大獨木舟迅速地，悄悄地，平滑地向着阿薩特的開懇地前進着，直到那抛下水去的掉竿大聲地發着嚮，人們口裏囁嚅着：「阿拉神，禮讚呀！」船輕輕地碰着杭木，到達房屋的下面了。</p>
<p>舟子們仰着臉不和諧地呌着。「阿薩特！喂，阿薩特！」可是没有人來。那個白人，開始登上那搭在房前的竹臺上的梯子。船長不快地說：「我們在舢板上燒飯，在水上睡覺。」　　「把毯子和籃子遞給我。」那個白人無精打彩地說。</p>
<p>他跪在竹臺的邊上接過了東西。於是船動了，那個白人站起身來，面對着阿薩特，因爲他已經從那間小屋的矮門口走了出來。他是精强力壯的靑年，有寛大的胸部和筋肉發達的胳臂。他的身上只穿着一條短褲。他的頭是光的。他的大而温柔的眼睛，熱烈地釘住個白人，但是他的話聲和態度是不參加一點的客氣；他突然地問：</p>
<p>「你帶着藥没有，屠安？」</p>
<p>「没有，」這個來客露出驚異的語氣說。「没有。什麽事呢？這房裏有病人麽？」　　「你進去看看，」阿薩特用同樣冷靜的態度說，他猛然地一轉又走進那小屋門去。那個白人，放下行囊，隨着他。</p>

<h3>油市白桐油漸漸低落</h3>
<p>丨洋莊不動漠行趁機開進丨</p>
<p>白桐油洋交、自漢市做每擔二十七元二三角後、市場上竟至寂靜無聲、漢行覩此情形、知非續跌不足以引動辦者心思、乃卽鬆至二十六元、而依然無交、今已跌至二十五元矣、能否因此引動交易、尙不可必、惟市旣跌至此、卽仍無交、或僅少數、而市面亦可一站、不致再有低落、且如此猛跌、或係行家欲藉此購進、以厚底積、而備洋行之需求、亦未可知、不然跌勢總無如此之鉅也、客貨亦因是而逐步低落、南支自二十一元七八角而三四角而二十一元、至前日民跌至二十元０七八角矣、而襄桐亦自二十一元七八角漸降至今日、竟至十九元六七角、均是客盤、時僅一週、暴落至此、實非所料、聞行家在此跌價聲中、約有六七千擔開進、底積已備、祗等求者、故此次之跌、謂爲漢行之操縱、亦甚確當也、本埠號家、因時已入秋、存底本不雄厚、或乘此時機而辦者、恐亦有之、惟總不願多備、浙桐方面、貨雖不多、但漢市旣跌至此、亦不能不隨聲附和、故據杭行所報、亦已鬆至每砠二十三元左右矣、祗因各處銷僅零星、未見多數交易耳、</p>

<h3>嗶嘰等售盤鬆盤緊不一</h3>
<p>邇來秋貨市氣仍好、各地辦客來滬、走銷依</p>
<p>然暢活、貨價則互有上落、似嗶嘰雨衣布、麥爾登厚嗶嘰見賤、華特呢花洋布黑炭襯、馬棕袖裏羽紗、海虎絨豹皮絨長毛駱駝絨等較貴、其因有三、一存貨多寡、二買方購胃强弱、三受日貨傾銷之影響、</p>
<h3>五金英白鐡每下愈况</h3>
<p>英白鐡　近來交易又見滯遲、客銷已呈萎靡、本街出路亦十分不振、而到貨層疊、供廣於求、則已爲不可掩飾之事實、標準受不良環境壓迫、已成江河日下之勢、而近日人心益見恐慌、（聞日貨已在暗中活動、致市價益有每况愈下之槪、刻市如七尺每張估一元四角三分、六尺一元二角半、二十八號每担十七元四角半、二十六號十六元四角、二十四號十五元四角、比之先前莫不回落二三分至二角不等、然市上尙無大宗生意、惟市上同業能一致杜絶日貨、則英白鐡之趨勢、並未謂無希望者、</p>

<h3>人不如犬</h3>
<p>— 愼言</p>
<p>「人不如犬」，雖然並不是一句成語，也不曾在唐宋元明淸歷代的那些大學問家的大作裏發現過，　當然也不成其爲典故；然而在我們的眼簾上，耳膜上却不時可以見到或聽到，一提起好像就覺得是很熟的。理由倒也並不怎樣複雜，祗因爲人們常把這句話當做感慨良深的表示的緣故。</p>
<p>用這句話來表示的感慨，細别之又分兩種：一種是大多出自談慕狗的表示。那些環境惡劣，經濟困難的窮人的口中。譬如說當苦力和小工的脚色，雖然他們也是五官四肢，足足地像了人樣，然而他們的享受比之有錢人家所養的狗，却眞是天差而地遠了。再像我們這些出賣腦力的小工，出門的時候，十九靠着兩條腿去走，偶一不凑巧，走到了一條積着許多污水的街道，正是挨着街沿，低下了頭，小心翼翼地在前進，却不防後面飛來了一輛一九三二年或是一九三三年的汽車，四個輪盤好像電風扇似的把街道上的泥漿望兩邊洒來，待你被洒到了無數點數泥漿而用一種憤慨的目光射過去看時，往往會使你看到一條略具異相的大狗或是小狗，正極安閑地坐在汽車上向你冷笑咧。到這時候，感慨就來了：「人不如犬」！　　還有一種是咒詛人的表示。譬如說你每天犠牲了一兩碗白飯，養着一條狗，它總能在晚上給你出幾分力，就是不會給你出力，也斷不致於顛倒來咬你！不幸你交到了一個黑心的朋友，雖然你是十二分的厚待他，結果他却又用一種凶惡的手叚奪取了你的財物，或是殺傷了你的生命！到那時，旁邊的人和你自已少不得多要來一句「人不如犬」，略誌感慨了。</p>
<p>以前，把「人不如犬」這句話來作爲羡慕狗的表示的事情，我自已也是常有的，却始終不曾把他有用來咒詛過人，因爲我覺得雖然眞有不如犬的人，可是畢竟絶對少數，爲着維持我們人的體面起見，這個感慨還是少發爲妙。然而近幾年來，我在報紙上所看到的人的新聞，却十九是「雖禽獸亦不屑爲之」的行爲。姦嫂殺兄，淫婦殺夫，箱屍案，·····簡直層出不窮，休說狗决不會有這種事情，就是豺狼虎豹，怕也未必如此。因此最近我已有了一層新的覺悟，我以爲無論富人家的犬坐汽車吃大菜，甚至於穿洋装，我們都没有資格羨慕他們，我們應該要憸點檢點，現代人的品性，及得上狗嗎！</p>
<h3>暴風雨</h3>
<p>— 傅翼之</p>
<p>時序像橡皮車輪般的推進，如火如茶的炎夏，已在不知不覺中悄然消逝，而「蟲聲新透綠窗紗」的詩句，又給作家們襲用到「初秋偶感」一類的文章上來凑閙了，唉！「昨日少年今日白頭」，不禁令我悚然於人生的短促和責任的艱巨。</p>
<p>可是，時序雖然已到初秋，氣侯並不急變，我在機械地繼續做著極輕微的筆頭工作，而由體内的水分所蒸發的臭汗，仍從三萬六千毛孔中不絶地淌出。　　那是一個下午，悶燥的空氣窒塞得喘不過氣來，我知道這是一個欲凉故熱的氣候轉變的必經程序，是暴風雨的徵兆；我們不用煩悶，更無須咒詛，我們只要暫時的忍耐，這快要没落的氣候，不久便會給暴風雨掃蕩以去，我在這麽預測。</p>
<p>我由黝黑色的室裏踱出，敗絮般的雲霧，舖满了整個的上空，猙獰可怕的陽光，間從雲霧的罅𨻶裏透下一線强烈的光芒，但不久又給濃厚的雲層密密地阻隔着，終至不能施展它的權威了。</p>
<p>雷聲隆隆地似戰鼓般的響着；閃電明滅地曲折地在灰黑色的雲際閃個不休，無疑的，它是暴風雨的前驅。　　東南角上漆黑的一團雲，吊下稀疎的幾綫雨脚，直伸到這熱力潛藏的大地上；接着刮上幾陣狂風，豆大的雨點，便隨着濃黑的雲霧展開它的陣勢，嘩啦嘩啦地向下射個不止；行人像大禍臨頭似的在作鳥獸竄。</p>
<p>大地愈加黑暗了，馬路上的垃圾，給雨水冲向路的兩邊跑；水窪裏的積水，受着雨點的襲擊，氾出一個個帶有色光的泡沬；勇敢的黃包車夫，拉著車子，冒着風雨，跟著那疾馳的奧司汀努力於長途的競走；安閒生活的迷戀者便躱進商店，衖口，不耐煩地觀望，懊惱，和咒詛！</p>
<p>朋友呵！光明在黑暗的背後；暴風雨是轉變氣候的「救世軍」，我們不耐久待，還是跟著暴風雨前進吧！</p>
<h3>「樂善好施」和「機器人」</h3>
<p>— 朱研</p>
<p>某先生說：「現在一般摩登學生眞慷慨，源源不絕的把大批父兄汗血的金錢，一學期，一學期，送進學校會計處的銀櫃裏，毫無吝色，使校長可以坐坐小奥斯汀汽車，敎授的老婆夠錢買高跟皮鞋，校工茶役的拖鼻涕兒子不嚷肚子餓，而自已則高坐雄踞在敎宔裏：搖搖腿，說說笑，寫Ｓweet　heart，哼Ｄream　Lover敎授們感恩圖報，想回敬些「學識」菲禮，學生眞客氣，原壁辭還，所以四年來一張總謝帖丨文憑上，應該加塡「樂善好施」四個大字，「藉揚仁風」。</p>
<p>某學生說：「誰說歐美人創造，日本人人倣造，中國人不造？」現在中國人倣造的本領，正不知要超過東洋矮子精幾千百萬倍，你瞧！歐美人發明了「機器人」不多時，日本人倣造還没成功，但我們中國却已大批出產應用了，謂予不信，請看國内各學府内講臺上指手劃脚，搖頭擺尾，死背課本，直照講義的，那一個不是十十足足道道地地的「肉體機器人？」</p>
<h3>吃太平</h3>
<p>— 醉竹</p>
<p>年年七月半打太平公　，孟蘭勝會，甚至僅僅放一台熖口，都是「地方夥計」「丐頭」「無賴」的一種額定收入。統而言之，就呌「吃太平。」</p>
<p>年常舊規，到了陰歷的七月裏，大夥兒凑上六七十文，買幾張「黃表紙」，訂成一本七歪八扯的捐簿。寫上幾個「神頭鬼臉」的大字丨丨孟蘭勝會，丨丨再把舊捐簿帶着。····這樣，便可以出發募錢，實行其「呌太平」工作了。</p>
<p>蔗　蔗當他們這「太平團」出發的時候，倒也是分工合作，各有專責：一個拿着長竹竿，是預備掛紙錠的；一個甩着大褡褳，是預備藏錢和錫箔的；一個拿着捐簿，登門募化那就是太平團的團長了。</p>
<p>蔗　蔗「哈！對不起，又要討厭了。年常舊規，此地巷口，要放台「熖口」賑濟孤魂，保佑人口平安」···這幾句話，是他們的「登門白，」每到一家人家，都用得着的。說完以後，不等主人開口，便把舊簿展開道：「去年府上是四角小洋，今年百樣都貴，高升一點，寫了八角吧？這是好事，這是···」</p>
<p>主人不答應，便由甩褡褳的，做好做歹，照舊寫上四角。若是答應的話，那麽明年便須八角，這是「年常舊規。」所以他們的捐數，是有增無减的。</p>
<p>這樣一家家寫去，或是錢，或是錠，直到寫遍了他們所要寫的爲止；好得他們是「地理鬼」誰家新遷，誰家舊户，某人有錢，某人尷尬，完全在他們肚裏，比了有名無實的「户籍册」要淸楚的多。所以募時，隨機應變，因人而施，很有一些資格，也决不會弄出事來。</p>
<p>到了預定的日子，弄幾個和尙，放一台熖口。再在橋頭巷口，貼上一張報銷單，那便是頂瓜瓜的「淸公事」了。</p>
<p>莫小看了這「報銷單；」它的作用，和銀行裏請會計師證明的「庫存報告」，有同等的功效。一樣能鞏固信用，吸收現欵哩。</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第十五回客去含羞柔情蕩微笑　　人來訪舊惡信啟悉懹</p>
<p>趙自强將手上揑着的一截烟捲頭，抛到地上，脚踏息了然後又微微的咳嗽兩聲，這才笑道：我本來有許多話要說，可是我嘴笨得很，簡直不知道從那兒說起來好。桂枝依然是微微笑着的咬了下嘴唇，不曾答覆這個問題。趙自强正着顏色道我本來就厭倦這軍隊生活的，打算不幹了。可是軍官的身體，不像是文官那樣自由。而且連長和兵士最接近的一個軍官，連長的上士司務長排長，誰都有些連帶的關係，换一個連長，是透着有許多麻煩，辭職很不容易。非特别的原因，上司是不會準的，這只有一個法子，先請短假，離開了軍隊，然後慢慢的向營裏寫信來請病假。無論軍隊裏怎麽樣不能放鬆你，也不能要一個病人去當連長是吧？桂枝這才逼出一句話來，微笑道：好好的人，幹嗎說害病？他說完了這句話以後，依然又是把頭低着下來了。趙自强道：我可也是這樣說這樣辦，我們老爺子，恐怕不歡喜的。可是除了這個辦法，要想辭職，眞是還不铭容易。桂枝道：那没關係。他很快的搶着說了這四個字，却没有了下文。所謂没關係，是說老爺子不歐喜没關係呢？還是說除了這個法子，不能辭職呢？若果如此，是非逼着辭職不可呀！因之趙自强只望了桂枝發愣，也說不出下文來。桂枝似乎也就看到他那個意思了，對他望着笑了一笑，有一句話想要說出來，却又忍回去了。趙自强道：我不是說了嗎，我是一個嘴笨的人，有話也說不出來，遇事還請您原諒。（一八四）</p>
<p>小常識</p>
<h3>應時蔬菜的藥效</h3>
<p>— 楚玉</p>
<p>現在夏秋之交的家常便飯，不論有產無產階級，大槪少不掉茄子，南瓜，冬瓜，西瓜，黃瓜等幾種蔬菜，不過我們中國人，對於無論那一種食物，祗求口味的好壞，而不明白各種食物的功用，所以把這類蔬菜，看得很不値錢了。其實，我們有許多毛病，不費分文，可以得到很有效騐的藥，尤其在窮鄉僻邑，患了痼症，請不起醫生時，就可把癈物利用的，現在我有幾種秘方發明，介紹社會，請各位讀者一一試騐，就知言之不謬了。</p>
<p>（南瓜）把很熟的南瓜肉切碎，在日光下曬乾，麽成細粉，可以治條蟲病，服法：每天用白開水服兩三錢，那條蟲就爲從粪便中下來的，如把南瓜子曬乾（不可用水洗擦）用冰糖煎湯，每天服二三錢，可以治小兒咽喉痛，又把南瓜的蒂頭，煆灰成性，每天用白開水吞服二三錢，有化痰的功效，比街肆中所售的什麽半夏爲效還大。</p>
<p>（黃瓜）採取很熟外部已變爲黃褐色的黃瓜，削去瓜皮，挖出瓜子，把肉切碎，装在磁陶器的罎中，用皮紙封好，不使走氣，放在陰凉的地方，若遇火傷燙傷，取出，腐爛的臭汁，塗在傷處，不但可以止痛，而創傷的疤，亦可平復除去，又採取黃瓜的嫩葉以在烈日下曬乾，每天有開水煎服五六錢，可以治五淋白濁與脚氣病。</p>
<p>（西瓜）大凡有白濁病的人，多吃西瓜很有效騐，又絞出西瓜的汁煮之，變爲西瓜皮糖，可以治腎臟病用，如把西瓜的曬亁，每天用開水煎服五錢，可以治浮腫性的疾病，又把西瓜的皮，用火煆灰，和以蜂蜜，如小兒患口癒時，搽之很有效騐。</p>
<p>（絲瓜）挅熟而嫩的絲瓜，壓榨其汁，用布滤淸，或從其莖中取汁，都可做化妝水用，如夏季小兒生痱子，用這瓜汁搽擦，淸凉立愈。</p>
<p>（冬瓜）蔬菜中的冬瓜，藥效尤大，如患腎臟炎，肋膜炎，腹膜炎，脚氣等病，非常靈騐，倘若誤食魚蟹中毒時，用冬瓜煎汁煎服之可以解毒，冬瓜的子，又可以治盲腸炎，從前所謂腸　湯，就是用冬瓜子，牡丹皮，桃仁，薏苡仁配合而成的。　　（玉蜀黍）患腎臓病的人，每天用玉蜀黍煎湯，以代茶用，味旣鮮美，又可治病，如用玉蜀黍的鬚（卽雌花花柱）煎服亦有奇效，若用玉蜀黍的根莖煎服，可以治膀胱結石病。</p>
<p>（茄子）茄子本爲有毒的植物，平常因爲經過煮沸與鹽醋等等的調和，有毒成分，就分解了，若把茄子燒灰成性，患齒齦腫痛的人，用灰摩擦，很有靈騐，又絞出茄子的汁，每天一二次搽在贅疣上，亦可治愈，又把茄子的花蔭乾，用開水煎服，可治盲腸與寄生蟲等腹痛等病，用茄子的莖葉煎汁，塗在凍瘡上，比什麽瘡藥爲靈。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>談「希望」</h3>
<p>— 之</p>
<p>好像曾經聽見人家說過，「希望」是生活的「燈塔」。没有「希望」的人，就好像是摸黑路的可憐的人：他没有光，没有氣，亦没有力！因爲，有了「希望」，便有追求的方向和行動，最後就發生創造一切的偉大的永遠顚撲不破的「力」！</p>
<p>然而，好像也有人說：中國是最有而且最會「希望」的民族。眞的，自從「九一八」日本兵以「張少師」看一臺戲的時間而搶去了「瀋陽」以後，中國人便開始在熱烈誠摰的「希望」中過生活：希望「國聯」主持正義，硬逼日本交還「東三省」而自已便可以不必發一彈傷一兵：希望「蘇俄」出兵「满州里」來戳日本人的屁股，好讓「義勇軍」在「靑紗帳」裏打勝仗；希望有一位「民族英雄」慷慨激昻視死如歸地帶一十二萬大兵出關去收復失地；希望英勇神武的「大刀隊」都能夠「就地十八滾」而滾到敵人的陣線裏好砍敵人的頭和腿！甚至於更希望天睜眼睛菩薩顯聖讓日本國内發生大地震，瘟疫大流行！還希望像神仙武俠小說裏「飛擔走壁」的「俠客」，「吐劍鍊氣」的「眞人」帶了天兵天將出世來把「右手一指」，「殺」的「一道白光」，接着矮兵矮將的頭顱滾遍了田野，死屍塡满了山谷，鮮血流得像溝渠，像黃河！</p>
<p>「一二八」來臨來了。ＸＸ路軍打了一個勝仗，於是中國人的「希望」更大了！除了以前的一大堆「希望」當然要保留着不算外，新的又產了好些「希望」：希望ＸＸ路軍一口氣打到楊樹浦，希望東洋兵退上兵船，逃出吳淞口外，希望每天早晨在報紙上會看見「擊落敵機五架」或「十架」，雖說我們並没有高射砲；</p>
<p>希望湖南人肯借路給「請纓抗日」的張ＸＸ出兵到上海來帮忙，也希望「白川」「瀏河陣亡」，希望那天晚上全市放的爆竹是眞的因爲「我軍」「打到外灘」！又希望增援，希望ＸＸ路軍從崑山南翔像騰雲駕霧般而且神不知鬼不覺地讓我們第二一大早開大門來見盡是穿草鞋戴笠帽的ＸＸ路軍！更希望馮ＸＸ的十萬大軍從天而降，當「瀏河被襲」的時候。當然也有些希望美國借大批大砲子彈來給我，希望德國人來替我開砲，希望廣東派幾十架飛機來和敵人在天空裏惡殺一塲。戰停了，字簽了，希望不喪權，不辱國，希望日本人賠償一切損失，接着還希望大家犠牲家財毀家紓難捐錢出來買飛機···</p>
<p>這亂七八糟，三天也數說不淸的一大把「希望」，當然同樣都是「光」，是「氣」，是「力」，只不過是「可以不必」實現的。因爲雖然不必［實現而我們的目的仍然一樣達到，這就是冥冥中有「天助」「神助」和「鬼助」的道理，而且這「天」，「神」以及「鬼」是必定永遠和我們「中國人」同在的！所以有人說：「僞國是不成問題的，五十年後，日本都要俯首貼耳的來順服中國，溥儀那小子能作甚麽威？」·····</p>
<p>是眞的，「希望」是生活的「燈塔」！有「希望」，就有「光」，有「氣」，有「力」！可是啊，可憐的人們，假使「希望」只變成了「期待」時，那，亦會發出耀眼的「光」不可阻止的「氣」與偉大的創造一切的「力」來麽？比如吧，奴，「希望」他的奴役者大發慈悲來救他的命，而自已倒放棄鬥爭，想，這「希望」是可能成功的嗎？不是變成了永遠不可期，永遠待不着的空期空待是什麽？所以，要想自已未解放，只有自已從事用自已的「力」！因爲這樣才能獲得一切的同情。期待式的「希望」人家來助，是痴子，是自欺，是没出息！因爲人家即使願意來助，這些出力來助的，無非也是另抱一個目的，至少，就是重復替佔以前一個奴役者的地位！</p>
<h3>開學典禮</h3>
<p>— 笠笠</p>
<p>「嘡！嘡！嘡！」鐘聲不停的響着，一下二下····三個一羣，五個一堆安間的在操斱塲上，敎室中的學得們魚貫的給禮堂的門吞了進去，白的衫黑的裙花的旗袍在門口消失了，鐘聲的餘音，嗡嗡的裊裊的散在寂靜的空氣中。</p>
<p>黑　　的頭，高短不齊的亂動着：</p>
<p>發光的木梳，花的緞帶，波浪般卷屈的美髮，直的散着的長髮，短茸茸童化的髮···髮的波，隨着頭的波動着，不住的動着。</p>
<p>唱黨歌，行敬禮，誦讀總理遺囑，靜默了。站着，一個個烏黑的頭低下去，長髮披到臉上，癢喜喜的，舉手向後掠，手肘碰着隔壁的頭，嗤的一聲，不好意思，陪罪的低笑聲。又是靜靜地。脚輕輕的劃着，左一劃，右一劃，」</p>
<p>得」丨皮鞋和凳脚接吻了，烏溜溜的眼珠射了過來，玫瑰色的紅暈印上了低下的頰。····</p>
<p>校長報告：「同學們···」和緩的輕微的，帶他本鄉口音的國語從他口中吐出來···抬着頭天眞的呆望着校長的嘴，用心的聽着（？）低着頭瞧着自已的脚，同學的脚，敎職員的脚，校長的脚，想從這許多不同的脚下，得到什麽似的。報告完了，窒塞寂靜的空氣鬆動一下，頭的波，髮的波又輕微的動了一兩下　　報告了！發光的秃頭在黑長衫上擺動着，重濁的遲緩的蒼老的聲音，刺刺不休的講着毫不知疲乏般的　，永遠没有窮盡般的講着。望望手表，五分十分半點了，仍是這樣重濁的遲緩的蒼老的聲音，刺刺不休的講着。花手巾在手中不住的播動，時而放開，時而摺好；繞着手指，左一繞，右一繞。兩個頭倚在一起，低低的談着天，極輕微的游行般的笑聲，從並倚着的頭縫中發出來。····</p>
<p>刺刺不休的聲音，像絃線般斷了丨如夢初醒的抬起頭來，茫然的四顧一下。散會一聲，如警鐘般的提起了人們的精神。太累了！整整的坐了三小時。</p>
<p>白的衫，黑的裙，花的旗袍，又給秋風煽動着在操場上飄動着。</p>
<h3>當眞「苦命」是註定了的嗎？</h3>

<p>大淸早，端坐在後門口架了銅邊眼鏡商擎着老申報一字一字含糊地唸着的李伯伯，他碰見我出來解溲，他就不住地將着那一掬三寸長的雪白的鬍子幌着腦袋極感慨而又像看透了這個奇妙的大世界似的硬扯住我說：</p>
<p>「中國人前世眞不知造了些甚麽重大的罪孽，所閻王爺才發放我們到陽間來吃這一層永遠吃不盡的苦，受這一生一世受不完的磨；唉！中國人的苦命是前节註定了的呀！」</p>
<p>我向來是不相信「命運」而且也最不觀喜聽關於「命運」的論調，况且這位老伯伯又是夾總不淸的閙着「前世」「寃孽」「閣王」「陽間」。這更呌我頭漲而感得　　然了，我眞討厭他，然而我又只好敷衍他：</p>
<p>「唔唔····李伯伯···」</p>
<p>同時，我又無意識的把視線移注到在他的乾而在顫抖着的手握中的報紙，我像發現了什麽，我不禁去顧問他的「命運」的論斷而驚愕地呌着：</p>
<p>「呀！看！今天報上又是大標題字載着「魯西黃河汎濫，二百萬人就溺」的消息！」</p>
<p>「是囉！中國人前世造了孽，而且還造得不小呀！這就是閻王爺呌我們來受罪吃苦的明證呀！不然，怎麽前年水蛟精出世，全國大水災，死了那麽多人還不夠，去年老天爺又打發殺星是東洋人下凡來屠殺了那些上海的生命，接着秋天豐收反而傷農，以及前不久武漢又閙大水，現在黃河又决口，遭殃的竟有二百萬人呢？其他如社會上苦樂不均的現象，和幾十年來在戰塲上打死的那些人，近兩年來更兇了，戰區裏無辜的老百姓也拖去當匪殺！這决不是平常的事，這斷定是命運註定了的，躱也躱不脫險的」。</p>
<p>他說得氣急了，有些嗆；大廓落落的黑眼珠在他起了皺紋的眼皮下呆住了，最後，他闔閉着嘆了口氣。我沉默了一會，我幽默的口氣反詰他：</p>
<p>「那末，李伯伯，前天報上說，兵船上開砲，砲子從大砲屁股後面射出來，打死了幾個兵士，想來這幾個寃鬼也是前世註定了的苦命嗎？」</p>
<p>「···」李伯伯只點點頭神氣是很莊嚴的。可是，我再也忍不住了，並且我還有唤醒這已經一大半進了棺材的麻木了的可憐的老頭兒的企圖，然而我的話是極輕順柔和而且極嚴肅的：</p>
<p>「李伯伯，您當眞相信命運是前世註定了的嗎？都是同一道理的，「命運」。只不過是野心家用以欺騙我們弱小者的麻藥呀！他們利用了這送我們命的麻藥好讓我們平心服氣的受壓榨受宰割，</p>
<p>而他們也便好安心無憂樂意地不斷地用毒杖來鞭策我們，他們知道我們是「命運論」信者，知道我們除了馴服呻吟和哀號以外，最多連掙扎也是不敢的。但是李伯伯，人總是人呀，我們應該把「命運」二字决用濃墨塗抹掉，自已捲起袖子來用自已的固有的力把一切阻碍都趕到我們的後面去用脚根加勁地踏着，···」</p>
<p>我的話並没有說完，他伯伯好像很疲乏了，他連着伸了幾個呵欠，他打斷了我的話，固執地說：</p>
<p>「浮話·浮話！我比你多話了幾十年，大槪比你想得通些的，你可曾知道世上那一件事不是不差毫釐聽憑命運的攏論的屬　「命運」到底是最眞的呀！」</p>
<p>「那末，李伯伯，中國人的「苦命」當眞是註定了的嗎···」我說·····</p>

<h3>古廟</h3>
<p>— 炳</p>
<p>滬北有一座斷垣廢墟彈痕依稀的古</p>
<p>廟。</p>
<p>廟難古，却不顯神，所以附近的居民都不大相信，有事反不怕遠遠的去求拜别處的神廟，這兒的烟火往常是非常稀疏。滬戰時，多少廟宇，唯獨這所淪於砲火，也可見廟裏的菩薩没有威靈。旣燬之後，爲時已一年有半，又從没有人，信女善男的人出而倡議重修，以致一逕是斷垣廢墟，彈痕依稀。</p>
<p>「廟雖古，却不顯神」，竟成了附近一帶居民的口頭碑。</p>
<p>相傳這古廟有一種禁例，就是凡屬年輕女子，不許入廟，因此，有時有誠心誠意的女子，要進貢燒香，問運求子，必得轉挽有徐娘資格的中年信婦進廟，代行求拜，自已只能在廟門口虔誠的望着廟裏的神像，呆呆地默禱。</p>
<p>這爲的是什麽，附近居民莫不有點茫然。</p>
<p>只有滬戰以前的一個晚上，廟裏的老僧人得一山爲對面的一家麫店打淸醮，曾對老闆阿求略爲說及過一點：「民國反正時，有過年輕女子在廟裏瞎撒野，」究竟怎樣撒法，老僧人是没有說下去了，阿求追問，老僧人却這樣殺住：「古廟已經不大顯神了，我們正在誠心護道，這等事莫再提了。」</p>
<p>例禁相埀了二十餘年，果眞没有人敢於輕犯。</p>
<p>然自滬戰以後，古廟旣淪戰墟，主禁的老人僧人也渺無聲跡，生死不卜了，例禁也就成了不開放的開放。於是便常有年輕女子探密似的走進望望。</p>
<p>不久以後來了一個新僧人，自道是某名山下來的，却竟不懂詩書，連自已的名字也話不大淸爽。白天出門，說是化募來修廟，但阿求却說曾見他在租界上討飯。</p>
<p>新僧人倒是很和藹的，在這樣火炙的暑天裏，晚上大批居民來廟裏露宿，他都不加拒絕，只，起初有許多男女孩子一絲不掛地穿進撞出，他頗有點不以爲然，但也僅僅這樣預告過兩句：「將來是不可以的，廟修好了！」</p>
<p>這一晚，狂風暴雨之後，露宿的人减稀了，只有正廳的前階躺着一對苦力夫妻，身旁的兩個小孩也着了衣褲，規規矩矩的像睡着兩頭懶貓兒一樣。另外在上方的一塊凈地上，還睡着一個中年貧婦，却是坦胸露乳的，丈夫原也一塊兒在睡，因在暴風雨之前趕回自已的茅棚端漏去了，就一逕没有轉來。</p>
<p>風雨過後，地裏熱氣騰放，天上的星星閃爍地，睡在半塌倒的披房裏的新僧人，却感到無限的氣悶與煩惱了，一顆佛心總是怦怦地跳，雖然黑摺扇不停的扇着手心，口唸阿彌陀佛，心，也總不能静下去。從星星的光波下，他隱約的窺着那中年貧婦的乳袋，忽而她的鼾聲一抽長，和自已的佛心一閃，就又閉着眼口唸阿彌陀佛。</p>
<p>結果是在天空已是魚肚色的拂曉了，許多人在上方的一塊凈地一圍住看新僧人，駡他打他，他也只是口唸阿彌陀佛。</p>
<p>「和尙也有這着，難怪古廟成了今日這樣子！」是位站在開旁的參透禪心的老婆婆在自語着。</p>

<h3>幸運兒</h3>
<p>— 因</p>
<p>四點鐘放學鈴敲過後，我覺得輕快極了，我的担子鬆了一半，雖然還要預備夜校的功課，可是我疲乏的精力，在此時應該有些安適有效的調劑，於是我獨自一人跑到草塲手上拿了一只籃球，在丈餘的草塲上獨自奔着玩球，「啊！多吃力呀！一個人在玩籃球。」看着我的人，這樣的喊着，但是我只覺得有趣，我忘記了切麻煩的，吃力的，汗是流着氣是喘着。一切都不覺，在我的腦海裏始終是這樣的想着：「運動是有益於健康·間接有益於學業的·」玩了二十分鐘的籃球，我改變了方針，我把蹺板踏着，踏得成功水平綫，自已立在中點，搖搖擺擺，覺得又是危險，又是有趣；後來我又去玩滑梯；一切都感到興趣十足。</p>
<p>啊！讀書之樂，樂無窮呀！媽說「讀了書，可以成功一個有智識的人，將來在社會上可佔到重要的地位，眞眞的做一個國家有用的人物，可是希望是無窮，祗要抓住現實，努力在現在，將來的憧惺不難達到，將來的幸福無不可以獲得的。」我聽了媽的話，我不禁想着：我是多麽的幸運啊，在這樣敎育不普及的國度裏，能受到中等敎育，這該是怎麽一件覺得徼倖的事呢！是的，我是幸運兒，可是還有在學校門外面的大量的衆人，我應當怎樣去看待他們呢？有很多的女子，她們不是無力求學，她們實在是被困於舊禮敎的環境之下的犠牲者·什麽「女孩子祇要識二個眼頭字！會看看普通信，寫冩日用賬就夠了，誰又不想女孩子去賺生活。」還有「每日來來去去在街頭上是怪惹人眼的」。我們想在這寥寥幾句話中，竟輕易地把我們女孩子的幸福葬送了。讓她在這漫漫黑暗的長途去摸索着，還有一般無力求學的貧窮孩子，他們或她們，眼熱地看着幸運兒挾了書包進學校去了，可是自已祗列於擯棄之伍·祗可垂涎七尺地望着望着，終竟他們或她們成了「目不識丁的文盲」「無知識的份兒」；受這樣痛苦的實在太多了。可是我能想什麽拯救他們的方法呢？敎育的不普及，應當歸罪於誰呢？可是事實眞是迷亂矛盾的，有好些地方學校是林立着，然而内容却又不堪設想，像我以前寫的一篇「學校林立］着一樣的糟！這種林立着的學校對於實際又有什麽補救呢？···</p>

<h3>戰爭與和平（二）（三）（四幕劇）　凌鶷</h3>
<p>第二幕逃亡之羣</p>
<p>傷者：你問我家裏還有少女嗎？我告訴你。我只有一個很好的兒子。可是已經死了幾年了。他留下一個孩子，今年才六歲。那個小孩兒眞是聽話，無論誰都很喜歡他。他整天在家裏跟着在一道做活。可是這一次我從前線回去的時候，唉，他們娘兒們都不在家，到外婆家裏玩兒去了。其實那裏是玩，老實說。還不是去討一口淡飯吃。現在怎麽樣了，我也不知道。我本來想去看看他們，可是因爲跟着大家怱怱忙忙的逃，還不是没有見一面，哎！可憐那個孩子跟着娘苦這末一世。···我眞愛他，可是這一行恐怕是見他不着了。</p>
<p>（大家聽了都很感動。足有一分鐘的沉默。其後那個救護員忽如大夢初醒似的呌醒了大家。）</p>
<p>救護員：很明白這次自動退兵。的確害了不少老百姓。（此時門外和窗。都慢慢的擠满了人，有時甚至於站在室内。）而且又退得這麽快。我是救護傷兵跟着軍隊跑的。十二號夜半，大槪一點多鐘的時候，由灤城退到古治。十三號下午兩點鐘，上面來一道命令。將笨重的東西，立刻運到後方。到晚上八句鐘的時候，我想現在總可以讓我好好的睡一夜了，誰知一道命令，立刻動身，要我們馬上退到胥各莊。二天一晚，差不多是三百來里。那末那些老百姓，自然都是睡在悶葫蘆中莫明其妙的。他們一聽說軍隊後退，馬上恐慌起來，好像是熱鍋上的螞蟻兒似的，只知道麻麻胡胡的跟着軍隊亂跑。哼，這個車站上擠满了人，恐怕不知有多少在路上啼啼哭哭哩。</p>
<p>夫人：（慢慢的從那邊到自已的座位上來），那個老頭兒眞是怪可憐的。這末老的年紀還要這樣受難。</p>
<p>娘姨：那末怎麽辦呢。</p>
<p>小姐甲：怎樣辦，就是照我們剛才說的那末辦。</p>
<p>勤務兵：（自外面的吆喝着進來。）</p>
<p>去去去，你們站在這裏幹嗎？這有什麽好看，去！</p>
<p>（羣衆先是不動，其後看見他拿出槍來，也就嚇散了。此時小姐乙獨坐在椅子上。一聲不響的沉默着。）</p>
<p>少爺：（坐着喊）德發！到這兒來，</p>
<p>我跟你說話。（勤務兵過去。）</p>
<p>救護員：那末現在我也去了。小姐還是給他到北平診去罷。在路是不要緊的，反正我已經給他扎好了。（下）</p>
<p>少爺：你和汽車夫一道，將那個老傢伙抬到站長那兒去，請他請個醫生設法給他診一診。這裏有二十塊錢，是我們給他們的醫樂費。</p>
<p>小姐乙：（；連忙過來。）什麽？你們不肯上北平診去嗎？這是什麽意思！</p>
<p>小姐甲：你看，又來啦，又來發瘋啦。</p>
<p>小姐乙：我發瘋？你才發瘋哩。你壓傷了他，難道診也不給人家診嗎？　　少爺：是給他診呀，到北平也是診，在這裏也是診，爲什麽不是診？</p>
<p>小姐乙：在這兒診。你說得好意思嗎？這裏有什麽醫院？二十塊元夠診病</p>
<p>嗎？</p>
<p>騙誰呀：而且他本是要逃到北平去，現在你們給他在這裏，不准他去，這是什麽意思呢？</p>
<p>姨娘：二小姐我看用不着這樣發脾氣的，他和你又不認識，你爲什麽要這樣給他打算呢你眞的帶他到北平去，</p>
<p>爸爸知道了是會駡呀。</p>
<p>小姐乙：這怕什麽。我們壓傷了他，只給他二十塊錢了事，這問得過良心嗎？</p>
<p>少爺：哎什麽良心不良，我們應當心這樣做，這是不會錯的，你年靑的女孩子懂得什麽呀。</p>

<h3>荒蠻影片的意義</h3>
<p>— 縻爾</p>
<p>凡是以「處女地，」或者落後民族做題材，或則做背景的影片，我們大槪都呌他「荒蠻影片。」</p>
<p>誰都知道歐美電影界，（特别是美國）對於荒蠻影片的製作，是非常熱心。這原因，我們只有明瞭了荒蠻影片的意義，纔能夠知道，資本主義一切的危機開始了。商品過剩，價格低落，一切資本主義國家，都陷入不景氣的狂潮中，原因是市塲縮小，民衆的購買力也因爲過度的榨取而急促的減低。這時候，他們（資本主義國家）却早已進到了最高形態丨帝國主義了。他們知道要消減這一個危機，只有再來一次分配和爭奪殖民地市塲的無恥的强盜戰爭。因爲世界上的「處女地，」是不會再有的了·他們這一個企圖在電影方面反映起來：</p>
<p>第一就是戰爭影片的提倡，把戰爭美化，來鼓動民衆的戰爭興趣來組織民衆的戰爭意識。</p>
<p>第二就是荒蠻影片的製作，把殖民地介紹給民衆，儘量的誇張着殖民地的財富，儘量描寫着「土人」們的愚蠢，甚至於用「只有白人能夠統治菲州，」或者『統治殖民地，就是開化土人，』的無恥的武斷宣傳來命令「民衆」做着開放發殖民地的夢。</p>
<p>這是目前一般的荒蠻影片積極的意義，消極方面最主要的是：神經敏銳的電影製作者，有意無意的感到了自已的没落，同時自已又没有方法挽救，不得已，就只有『逃空虚』和『返歸自然』的的空想，他們憧憬着『原始』的生活，於是『人猿泰山』中的『眞妮，』就和『泰山』一同入山了。</p>
<p>至於中國，那末，誰都知道是全世界最大的市場，是各帝國主義的民閭，說誇張一點他們的經濟狀况，是隨着中國民衆的購買而得轉移，羅斯福不是公開的說嗎？要世界經濟復興，一定要使中國的購買力增加，但是中國的購買力是因爲他們不斷的榨取而不但不增加，并且大大的減低了，這一來，不但急壞了帝國主義者，同時也急壞了他們的爪牙和奴才，於是他們就想向中國境内的落後民衆發展了。於是電影又當了前衛！</p>
<p>在這裏我想一定會有人起來反詰了，是不是應該拍攝關於猺苗的影片呢？不，拍攝猺苗的影片；是絕對需要的，不過我們絕對不應該忽略了他們的實生活，和急迫的需要，（解放運動之類），而僞造什麽『艷史，』或者「野史」之類，不久之前，我們不是在報紙看到猺民十五萬暴動的消息嗎？這雖則報紙上說他們是『猺匪，』但我們知道是受了壓迫而反抗，是一定的，那末，這樣偉大的題材，不値得我們攝取嗎？「亞洲風雲」已經放在我們的面前，反帝反封建，才是眞正以落後民族做題材的好影片！</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「拚命」</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>看了本片以後，我祇想原則的寫出一些意見。</p>
<p>自東北失陷以後，無疑的激起了中國一般小市民羣衆的反感。大多數的人們，他們在大砲聲中覺醒了自身的出路，因爲認淸了中國之所以被人侵略的原因，於是有組織的而從事徹底的反帝運動。積極的走上民族戰爭的前途。但是另一方面不覺悟的羣衆，他們固然憤恨日軍的暴行，他們固然迫切的要求收復失地，但是他們常將自已囚在狹隘的國家觀念中，於是所能做到的祗是愛國運動。他們所表現的是一方面抵制仇貨，一方面爲國捐軀。</p>
<p>現在，這兩種觀念在不斷的爭鬥着。我們在電影作品上也可以看出兩個不同的分野。劉春山的「拚命」，自然是屬於後者，我們在這作品中可看出他懷着满腔的憤慨，他注意到了失業問題，他知道中國只有奪力抵抗才是出路。他痛恨販賣仇貨的奸商，他憎惡有錢人的慘酷的壓迫，但是他的認識是錯誤的，在他狹隘觀念中存着不少的幻想。譬如他以爲一個富家女甘心廢棄她的地位而愛上一個小瘪三，以爲援助義勇軍祇有外國的華僑才會熱心拿出錢來。於是憑他良心愛國的主張，一方面抵制仇貨，而另一方面便極力提倡國貨。在這裏我們並不否認敵人經濟侵略的事實，然而我們認爲良心愛國决不是有效的方法。何况中國民族資本决不是可以在列强的鐡蹄之下可以生長起來，雖然列强也希望中國能夠自封建製度中走上資本主義的前途而矛盾的扶助中國資本在極小的範圍中發展。丨丨所以，我們希望作者能夠認淸這一大前提，不要囚在愛國觀念中而上了壓迫者的圈套。否則，作者終於没有出路，甚至於影響觀衆陷於絕路。</p>
<p>至於技巧方面，我們可不必指出每一個小的錯誤，也只能原則的糾正一些。</p>
<p>第一，作者不懂得喜劇的基本構造。所以說假定這是滑稽片，那末根本失敗。</p>
<p>第二，就内容而論，這應當以滑稽的形式演出。</p>
<p>第三，不應當將主人翁勉强的寫成一個英雄。</p>
<p>如此，其成績之糼稚庸俗，自然在所難免。於是乎當我們看到那奸商有着離奇的翻眼病，一藥即愈，以及說日本的味之素是診治痔瘡的等等，都不禁喟然而嘆。他如Ｍｏｎｔａｇｅ的不合法，以及一切技巧上的不純熱，都希望作者加緊努力。</p>
<p>所以我們的結語是：「小市民的積極性，在本片中充分的表現出來，但演出令人過於失望。」</p>
<h3>字紙簏</h3>
<p>— 不敏</p>
<p>稿件到字紙簏裏去的，當然是很不幸的了；但是在編者，决不至有「草菅」之舉，這是編者的要向愛護本刋的讀者及作家聲明的。文字不通，無味，及宣傳過甚的稿件，自有隨時擲人字紙簏的危險，而可用的稿件，因篇幅缺乏而不能披露的，除掉附有書就的信封及貼有郵票者隨時寄還之外，亦不得不擱置案頭，徐待發表的機會；但是時間性一失，亦祗可以向字紙簏裏去了。今天有兩件稿子，亦遭擲入字簏之殃：一件是藝華通訉，關乎杭州攝製飛機影片的事，明明可用的稿件，徧徧在文字當中蓋了一塊兩方寸多的宣傳部藍黑色印。字多看不出了，改旣不可改，排亦不能排。好比郵政局裏的職員，明明海外寄來的風景明信片，他徧徧别處不蓋印，將郵戳蓋在畫面上（煞風景）。明明稿子後面空地很多，不去蓋印而要蓋在字上。同樣的代表了我們中國不愛好的惡性，我於是决定不用而擲入字紙簏中了。大槪讀者對於鄙人的手段。不至於目爲武斷吧。還有一篇是歌琢君的來稿，關乎月明影片公司的「惡隣」的。這是歌琢君看完了「惡隣」試映之後，而寫的稿子。我因登載一切預告，露布，介紹文字等等，流弊很多，所以一定要等一張片子公映之後，來了一個正確的評，然後再酌量登載些觀衆意見。我想這是公允的辦法，所以歌琢君的稿件亦向字紙簏裏去了。昨天還有幾篇稿子，一篇係照蟹行文字的橫寫的，一篇係兩面寫的，一篇係鉛筆寫的，亦都向字紙簏裏去了。中國文字習慣係從右而左，自上而下。橫寫或兩面寫，俱與排字工作有碍的，所以一槪拒絕了。至於鉛筆寫的，一到排字先生們烏黑的手裏，就糊裏湖塗，不分皂白了。我想還是要保持些黑白的好。</p>
<h3>觀衆意見</h3>
<p>— 不敏</p>
<p>編者言：「金山」是一張外國片子，但不是專「拿侮辱我中國民族影片來换我們的金錢的國家」的出品，并且於我們有很多的敎訓。從衆人的口裏傳說所得到的，都是好的評語，所以我破了例，給牠披露些觀衆們的意見。</p>
<h3>談談「金山」</h3>
<p>— 姚寅仲</p>
<p>無疑地，目下正在映演着的蘇俄新片「金山」，與過去的「生路」同樣是「力」的表現，而且比較「生路」的「力」更要强。它與「生路」一類片子，同樣是缺少着酥軟的誘惑性，它所有的只是强烈的興奮性。它對於有閒階級的公子哥兒們是没法給予满足的，它只能給予他們一個枯躁乏味的感覺而已！</p>
<p>它的結構的外形倒是和「亞洲風雲」一樣，都是以「反抗」二字爲中心意識：異的是内容，「亞洲風雲」以「民族」爲立塲，「金山」則以「階級」爲「立塲」；「亞洲風雲」的對象是「帝國主義，」而「金山」的對象則是「布爾喬亞」。</p>
<p>「金山」暴露壓迫階級丨布爾喬亞的貪婪橫暴，和欺弄被壓迫階級丨普羅列塔利亞的手叚，很是淋漓盡致，蔑以加矣。</p>
<p>至於說起演出，當然是很成功的，每個演員，都不是對電影技巧生疏的人，尤其如那去工人彼得和工頭的二演員，更是對於電影技巧有很大的造詣的。那可憐蟲的土人和對廠主忠實而對工人陰詐狡猾的工頭，都靠了他們二位演員的努力而表現得惟妙惟肖。導演的手法出很靈活，對於塲面的佈排，可謂煞費苦心；其中有幾處，最是其他資本主義國家影片上所没有的，可算是蘇俄電影界持有的創作了。</p>
<h3>銀幕上的接吻</h3>
<p>— 東林</p>
<p>看過外國片子的年靑人，以爲外國明星可以抱了如花似玉的美麗女郎接吻，艷福眞是非淺呵！其實，他們都不曾知道其中的幻妙吧了！</p>
<p>大家都知道，克拉克蓋勃爾在銀幕上接吻的回數是很多的吧！但是當你們聽了他關於接吻的痛苦的經騐時，你們不能不驚異了。</p>
<p>他說：「一直到現在，我已經拍過和五十多位女明星接吻的鏡頭了。但是這都不過是假的吧了！你不相信，攝影塲中儘管摟抱着吻着，一走出攝影塲都是毫無關係的外人吧了！我不知道，是否是導演的不許我大槪在嘴唇接近到一吋的三分之一的時候就滑過去了，可是這需要非常的苦練，然後看起來才像眞的。不過你假使拿幾百倍的顯微镜鏡照，那就不對了。老實說，做明星的只有天曉得！」</p>

<h3>满江紅（五）</h3>
<p>— 乾白</p>
<p>天哪！二香乃是新野的情人，他不過是替她畫一張像，無端的竟會破壞了他和桃枝間的情愛，這是從何說起！然而她間接的買畫，忍痛的嫁給有光，這苦心，這旆犠牲，該是多麽偉大啊！她那小小的心靈，將永遠印留着這不可磨滅的創痕，又該是多麽痛心啊！　　决定了，水村决定趕到上海對她解釋。本來他有誤會，她一次一次來解釋，現在她有誤會了，他怎能不去解釋一下呢？可是在這茫茫的上海，又呌他到那裏去尋找這渺小的桃枝呢？　　桃枝和有光舉行結婚了，他雖是看見，但他没有勇氣跑上去對桃枝說明，他眞不知道應該怎樣是好？猛然地，一個華装的中年女人，牽着兩個孩子，從人叢中擠到禮堂裏·指着有光帶着氣憤的說：「好！你居然敢又結婚嗎？丢掉我和孩子怎麽辦？」　　這眞是一件煞風景的事，但有光却很服貼地跟着那女人和孩子一同去了，桃枝經到這慘變，又是多麽的傷心？除了哭，還有什麽辦法呢？水村對她是非常的同情傷痛，但他不肯錯過這解釋的機會。水村向她解釋了；桃枝亦接受他的解釋了；水村並且告訴她要到漢口去的意思。</p>
<p>「爲什麽又忽然要到漢口去呢？」</p>
<p>「因爲我在這幾天裏，已經覺悟到「戀愛」是有錢與有閒的人所玩的把戲，我們這些窮小」</p>
<p>子，應該把談戀愛的熱情和精力，移在有力不能食的環境裏，去奮鬥自已的生路才是！」　　「····」</p>
<p>桃枝對於水村，已有了深刻的了解，所以在水村未去之前，她覺得至少還要去看水村一次，和水村再談一談；但是等到了她趕到船上，水村已是酩酊大醉。船已將開行，然而在這樣的情况之下，桃枝又怎肯獨自登岸而離開水村，讓他一個人帶着醉走去。</p>
<p>「火！火！」</p>
<p>在夜深人靜的時候，忽然地，人聲嘈雜起來，男男女女，老老少少，紛紛的，爭先恐後的，一齊都向甲板上奔跑，是爲什麽？啊！原來是貨船失愼，火勢已經不可收拾，桃枝呼喚着不村，久久都没有醒來，桃枝怎肯丢棄水村一個人逃走，這眞呌桃枝急煞！一刹時，紅光遍满了江面，水村和桃枝，好像都没有逃出這紅光的包圍。（完）</p>

<h3>The Military Readjustment Committee Decides on Methods for Reducing Military Strength</h3>
<p>Thirty Men to be Discharged from Each Company; All Military Divisions to Undergo This Process</p>
<p>Monthly Military Expenditure to be Reduced by 560,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Establishment of Training, Management, and Supervisory Committees</p>
<p>(Beiping) The authorities have been planning for the reorganization of the North China armies for some time. Currently, monthly military expenditures still require more than five million yuan, with a significant gap between income and expenditure. Due to a telegram from Chiang in Beiping, advocating for a return to pre-war budget levels, reduced to 4.5 million yuan, He Yingqin specially summoned all generals at the division commander level and above to Beiping to discuss methods for downsizing the military and reducing salaries. Last night, He hosted a banquet for the generals at Jurentang to exchange views. This morning at 9:00 AM, a special meeting was convened at Jurentang, with the generals arriving one after another. Those present included He Yingqin, Song Zheyuan, Yu Xuezhong, Shang Zhen, Wan Fulin, Yan Bingxun, Wang Shuchang, Gao Guizi, Liu Duoquan, Bao Wenxue, Rong Zhen, Jiang Bocheng, Liu Yifei, He Zhuguo, Ji Yiqiao, Qi Dechun, and several others. Sun Dianying and Shen Kejun sent representatives to attend. After Chairman He opened the meeting, Shen Zhenrong, the head of the Military Supply Group of the Military Readjustment Committee, first reported on the financial situation in North China. He stated that income was only slightly over 2.5 million yuan, while expenditures reached over 5.1 million yuan, resulting in a monthly deficit of over 3 million yuan. After a monthly subsidy of 2 million yuan from the central government, there was still a shortfall of 1 million yuan, which should be reduced to meet the budget. He then announced the difficulties of reorganizing the military and reducing salaries. Next, he presented the downsizing and salary reduction methods drafted by the staff and military supply departments of the Military Readjustment Committee. Regarding salary reductions, two tables were listed, detailing how much each army and division would be reduced. One table totaled over 700,000 yuan in reductions, while the other totaled over 600,000 yuan. Many felt that the reduction amounts for each army in the tables were not very fair, and there were diverse and conflicting opinions, leading to no resolution. Finally, it was decided to continue the meeting at 3:00 PM to discuss the matter in more detail. The meeting adjourned around 11:00 AM. Afterward, He convened a meeting of the heads of various relevant groups of the Military Readjustment Committee to revise the salary reduction plan, preparing to present it for discussion at the afternoon meeting.</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Military Readjustment Committee continued its meeting at 3:00 PM in the afternoon. The attending generals first reviewed the proposals separately, made slight revisions, and then began discussions. It was decided that each division of all armies would discharge thirty men from each company. It was estimated that this would reduce military expenditures by over 400,000 yuan per month for the Northeast Army. Other armies, such as those of Song Zheyuan and Sun Dianying, would save over 100,000 yuan per month. After these reductions, North China's military expenditure would still require over 4 million yuan per month. However, North China's monthly income was only about 2 million yuan, and the 2 million yuan subsidy from the central government was temporary. Therefore, there was still a shortfall of over 2 million yuan. Other measures would be devised for the shortfall when the central government subsidy ceased. The meeting adjourned at around 6:00 PM. At that time, it was also decided that the Northeast Army would take divisions as the unit, and the military and division commanders would first consult on implementation methods. Other armies would consult on their own, and then present their decisions at the Military Readjustment Committee's regular meeting on the 13th. Implementation would begin in October. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After the reduction in the size of each army, the monthly military expenditure will be reduced by 560,000 yuan, restoring the pre-war budget of 4.5 million yuan. It is estimated that each division of the Northeast Army will reduce military expenditure by more than 20,000 yuan per month, totaling about 440,000 yuan. The 29th Army will reduce by 30,000 yuan per month, the 32nd Army by 20,000 yuan, the 40th Army by 20,000 yuan, the 41st Army by 40,000 yuan, Gao Guizi's unit by more than 9,000 yuan, and Shen Ke's unit by 10,000 yuan. The method of reducing the Northeast Army is to eliminate one machine gun company from each regiment and one infantry company from each battalion, reducing the number of personnel in each company by more than thirty. Other units will be reduced according to the planned expenditure as the standard, and will be reduced according to the amount. At the same time, in order to actually unify and reorganize each army, it has been decided to establish a training committee and a management and supervision committee. The organization has been handed over to the Military Readjustment Committee for drafting and will be distributed soon. Other cases will be discussed at the regular meeting on Wednesday. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Military Readjustment Committee has appointed eleven people including Qian Dajun, Rong Zhen, Shang Zhen, and Zou Zuohua to draft the training outline for the implementation of future military education, and will submit it to the standing committee for discussion and implementation.

<h3>Problems Arise from the Transfer of the Beiping Public Security Bureau</h3>
<p>Representatives from All Sectors Retain Bao Yulin</p>
<p>He Orders Yu Jinhe to Postpone Taking Over</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yu Jinhe was originally scheduled to take over as Director of the Public Security Bureau this morning. However, at around 6:00 AM this morning, fellow Northeasterners and representatives from all sectors led a crowd of over a thousand people to the Public Security Bureau to petition. They temporarily appointed representatives Gu Xinsan, Ma Xiaoqing, and others to enter the bureau to request a meeting with Bao Minlin. Shao Zhicheng, the chief of the First Section, met with them on Bao's behalf. The representatives stated their views, refusing Yu's takeover and Bao's handover. They also requested to meet Bao in person to present everything. At around 9:00 AM, Bao arrived at the bureau by car to hand over duties and was surrounded by the crowd, who asked him to temporarily leave the handover. Bao then went to the municipal government to meet Yuan Liang. The crowd then went to the Military Readjustment Committee to meet He, requesting the government to withdraw its order. As no one in the committee was responsible, they gained nothing and went to Jurentang to meet He. The crowd sent representatives Zhang Zikui, Ding Weibang, and others inside. He sent representative Xie Zhongyuan to meet with them. The representatives stated their views: (1) Retain Bao to continue as the Director of the Beiping Public Security Bureau and request the government to withdraw the order of removal. (2) If the petition is unsuccessful, they will send representatives to Beiping to petition, and hoped that various parties would sympathize with the Northeastern people who had no home to return to. They left around 1:00 PM. It was heard that the authorities had agreed to telegraph the central government for instructions and would forward the representatives' requests to the government as much as possible. A response to the crowd was scheduled for 2:00 PM on the 13th. People gradually dispersed after 1:30 PM. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to some sources, the retention of Bao had been brewing for some time. Last night, when He hosted a banquet for Northeastern generals, they all expressed their views. He even instructed the commander of the military police to relay to Yuan Liang to order Yu Jinhe to postpone the takeover. Some generals were still dissatisfied with this, and Huang was also arguing strongly about whether to stay or leave. This issue may escalate. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yuan Liang stated that he had no opinion on the removal of Bao or on Bao personally. After taking office, he had a good personal relationship with Bao, and Bao had also worked hard for public security. However, the Director of the Public Security Bureau must have sufficient police knowledge, quick administrative skills, a clear understanding of the international situation, and familiarity with local conditions to adapt to the environment. Bao's transfer was something he was unaware of beforehand and he would wait quietly for the central government to handle it. The new Director, Yu Jinhe, requested sick leave for five days last night. Because the atmosphere of retaining Bao was intense, he received a personal instruction from He to postpone the takeover. He immediately approved Yu's five-day leave. Yu has gone to the Western Hills to rest and has telegraphed the Executive Yuan to report and request instructions. This morning, he invited Bao to his residence for a meeting and asked him to temporarily be responsible for maintaining public order before the new director takes office. Bao has agreed. However, Bao stated that the handover procedures in the bureau have been completed, and he can hand over duties whenever Yu takes office. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang Plans to Assist Rural Areas</h3>
<p>Telegrams Each Province to Send Personnel to Jiangxi</p>
<p>(Hankou) Chairman Chiang believes that the countryside has been impoverished in recent years. Famine is unavoidable in years of poor harvest, but low grain prices hurt farmers in years of good harvest. The ways to provide relief are: (1) Regulating the surplus and shortage of grain among provinces and blocking the dumping of foreign rice. (2) Storing surplus grain in good years to prepare for insufficient harvests in lean years. (3) Activating rural finance to stabilize the plummeting grain prices. The coastal provinces are experiencing bumper harvests this year, and it is imperative to plan and take action immediately to establish a plan to help farmers. He has drafted a plan for collection and storage: 1. Hunan and Jiangxi are regions with surplus rice production and should actively seek to connect with Guangdong, Shanghai, and other places that have historically lacked grain, and negotiate with the relevant provincial and municipal authorities to encourage grain merchants to purchase as much as possible from the Yangtze River to suppress the domestic sale of foreign rice. The Yangtze River provinces should provide various conveniences to Guangdong and Shanghai grain merchants to show their appeal. 2. Manage grain storage, restore the old system of local warehouses, investigate and follow the detailed methods determined by the Wuchang Headquarters, earnestly implement them, and strive for actual results. 3. It is proposed to request the central government to allocate funds from the cotton and wheat loan to create new-style warehouses in each province, manage the storage of rice and grain, loan funds for pledging, and coordinate transportation and sales to regulate food supply, raise grain prices, and circulate rural finance. In the future, the Farmers Bank of the four provinces will do its utmost to assist with revolving funds. However, since this matter has many details and is not easy to start, he has specially telegraphed the provincial governments along the Yangtze River to each send a representative who is familiar with rural conditions and has experience in the warehouse system and grain management to gather in Jiangxi before October 20 to discuss and decide on methods together. After receiving the telegram, the Hubei Provincial Government ordered the Department of Civil Affairs and Finance to instruct each department to select experienced personnel and then select one person from each department to submit to the next provincial government meeting for a decision.

<h3>Ji's Side Still Does Not Submit; General Headquarters Established at Dushikou</h3>
<p>Song Orders Zhao Dengyu's Division to Block the Pseudo-Army</p>
<p>Ruan Xuanwu Takes Office as Garrison Commander of Kangbao City</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhang Tan telegram: The Provincial Government received a telegram from the Tenth Division Commander Tan Zixin from Yanqing, reporting on the transfer of defenses. The division headquarters is located in Yongningzhen City. Ji's side recently received a telegram from the Cantonese side, and its attitude seems to be unchangeable. Ji is now establishing the Northern Route Army Headquarters in Dushikou. Liu Guitang is taking surveillance actions against Fang and Ji's troops. Song Zheyuan sent Zhang Lingyun to take charge of the local garrison east of Zechang. Song will go to Tianjin tonight to visit his mother and is scheduled to return to Beiping on the morning of the 13th to go to Chahar. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan said that the aftermath of the Chahar armies will be handled in accordance with He's intentions. However, after the reorganization, the uniforms are not neat and there are no cotton clothes. Funds are needed to rush production and he has requested He to issue salaries. For Tan Zixin, Li Shouyi, and Zhang Renjie's troops, he has requested He to follow the methods of Feng Zhanhai and Bao Gang, and be directly under the Military Readjustment Committee. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhangjiakou telegram: Ruan Xuanwu arrived in Kangbao at noon on the 10th and telegraphed that he was taking office as the garrison commander of Kangbao City, determined to obey the central government and defend the locality. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhangjiakou telegram: Liu Guitang's representative Tian Gangyi visited Song at noon on the 9th, reported everything, and requested maintenance expenses. Song approved 2,000 yuan and Tian used the money to purchase military supplies such as horseshoes locally. At 8:00 AM on the 11th, the army went to Xuanhua and then to Chicheng. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Most of the Chahar miscellaneous troops have been reorganized. The problems of Fang and Ji's failure to submit and Tang's request for reorganization still require some twists and turns. Song's visit to Beiping this time was partly in response to He Yingqin's call to discuss the reorganization of the North China armies, and partly to request instructions on the aftermath of the Chahar situation. Ji has arrived in Dushikou to contact Fang Zhenwu, seeking to combine with Liu Guitang and Tang Yulin's troops. There are communist elements in Ji's troops, making reorganization quite difficult. The central government has ordered Fang Zhenwu to leave the army, but Fang does not want to leave. Song is acting in accordance with the central government's intentions and feels extremely difficult in presiding over it. Tang is still sending personnel to Datang to request reorganization, but no agreement has been reached. The pseudo-army Li Shouxin's troops, which invaded Dolon, have recently attempted to harass Baochang, and some have advanced towards Baochang. After Song went from Zhangbei to Ertaizi and sent Zhao Dengyu and other troops to advance, the pseudo-army retreated upon hearing the news. There has been no movement in recent days. Song has a plan to resolve the Fang and Ji problems. He went to Beiping yesterday to meet He and has personally handed it over to He, waiting for a method to be discussed before proceeding with the plan to resolve it as soon as possible. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) The remaining three hundred soldiers of Feng's Training Regiment in Fenyang will be resolved by dispatching a team after Xu Yongchang and Song Zheyuan discuss it by telegram. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<h3>West Bank of the Jinsha River; Tibetan Troops Have Not Taken the Offensive</h3>
<p>The Military Action This Time Is Actually a Rotation of Troops</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission received a telegram from the Dege Negotiation Office in Xikang stating that the newly appointed Tibetan official, Chuguo Daiben, recently led troops from Bomi and Wang's troops from Ji Ba Daiben along the west bank of the Jinsha River, moving south. The Battalion Commander of the Dege garrison temporarily abandoned and did not defend the various crossings of the Jinsha River due to the Tibetan army's repeated actions and rumors of Tibetan troops invading, and gathered troops in Dege. After the negotiator Jiang sent envoys to question the Tibetan side about the reasons, he learned that the Tibetan army's military action this time was actually a rotation of officials and troops, with no intention of attacking our army.

<h3>Shi Yousan's Troops; Reorganize a Large Number of Bandits</h3>
<p>Bandits Lurk Outside the Qinhuangdao Station</p>
<p>Residents North of the Station Move Away in Succession</p>
<p>(Beiping) In Yutian County, most of Shi Yousan's troops are lower-level officers. This time, the security team is being reorganized. The leader of the team, Hu Xie Wu, is currently in Tianjin for negotiations. The unit will begin reorganization. Bandits have always been rampant in Yutian. Recently, during the reorganization, Shi actually recruited thousands of local bandits, and their power has expanded. Yu Xuezhong has concrete plans for suppressing bandits in eastern Hebei and has discussed them in detail. He has decided to continue to negotiate with the Japanese side to eliminate them as soon as possible. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A person from Qinhuangdao said that bandits are rampant in eastern Hebei. Outside the Qinhuangdao train station, bandits often lurk. Residents north of the station cannot bear the harassment and have recently moved south of the station. A few days ago, bandits gathered to plot to rob the train and loot property. They fled after the county government dispatched a large number of security teams to suppress them. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<h3>The Shanhai Pass Customs; Can Be Expected to Be Received Soon</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) When the war in North China broke out, the customs offices in Shanhai Pass and Qinhuangdao were withdrawn to a safe area and merged into the Tianjin Customs for office work. Now that the war zones in eastern Hebei have been taken over, the Qinhuangdao Customs has also been recovered last month, and all staff are working as usual. The Beiping Political Affairs Committee has repeatedly negotiated with the Japanese side regarding the stationed customs office in Shanhai Pass, and there has been progress recently. The issue of receiving it is currently being discussed, and it can be expected to be received soon. It is estimated that the loss of the two customs offices in Shanhai Pass and Qinhuangdao, which fell one after another for eight months, reached more than seven million yuan. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<h3>Nineteen Counties in the War Zone; Request Return of Military Advances</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Representatives from the nineteen counties in the Hebei war zone are scheduled to visit He Yingqin tomorrow morning to petition for the return of military advances during the war. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<h3>Central Government Memorial Week Reports</h3>
<p>Jing Hengyi: Sacrifice and Unity</p>
<p>Ye Chuqiang: Telegrams from Wang, Chiang, Ma</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The central government held the 95th Memorial Week at 8:00 AM on the 11th, attended by Central Committee members Ju Zheng, Wang Qi, Li Ciwen, Jing Hengyi, Xie Zuomin, and staff members, totaling over 600 people. Chairman Ju Zheng presided. Jing Hengyi reported, stating that spiritual sincerity and unity is a logical rule. Humans are inherently difficult to unite, so there must be this logical rule to promote unity. A necessary condition is mutual sacrifice. If one does not sacrifice oneself and wants others to sacrifice completely to unite with oneself, this is forced submission, definitely not from sincerity. In the future, the world's humanity will progress from complex sacrifice and unity to simple, with only two left. Within the same group, they can be represented by left and right, and in different groups, they can be represented by red and white. Party disputes are left-right disputes, and world wars are red-white wars. If one can unite and be willing to sacrifice, they can still coexist and prosper, armed peace. Sun Yat-sen put forward the idea of a world for all and universal harmony, which can be explained as nothing more than sacrifice. In my ideal harmonious society, if the people defend themselves and each has a handgun, everyone is armed, and political power must be made public, this is armed harmony. To thoroughly make political power public, it must be after military power is made public. Political power cannot be held and cannot be avoided, only then is it considered public. Economy is the source of life. In the current social situation, people leave their property to their children after death, the so-called "leaving it to future generations." I advocate sacrificing this concept. If this inheritance is paid to the Great Harmony Association as its fund, accumulating and spreading over time can absorb enormous inheritance and become a large-scale social organization, undertaking public welfare undertakings, such as homes for the elderly, orphanages, hospitals, schools, roads, rivers, parks, and theaters, without exception. The heavy burden of supporting parents and raising children can be lifted. The simplest creed of this method is to break the family system and not inherit property. In short, it is still nothing more than sacrifice and unity. From politics! We can proceed simultaneously from society! Nothing cannot be accomplished. (Central News Agency telegram on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government held a Memorial Week at 8:00 AM on the 11th, attended by Chen Shaokuan, Ye Chuqiang, Lü Chao, Wei Huai, He Yaozu, and other government officials, totaling over 400 people. Ye Chuqiang presided and led the ceremony. Ye reported that last week was an important period because after Minister Song returned to China, President Wang, Chairman Chiang, President Sun, Minister Song, and several central committee members met in Lushan to discuss national affairs. The details of the discussion will be reported to the National Government by Wang and Song in one or two days. But before learning the content of Wang and Song's report, reading the telegrams from Wang, Chiang, Chen, Li, Cai, and Ma can give a rough idea of the party and state's major policies. The contents of the Ma telegram can be roughly divided into several points: (1) Regarding the timing of the Fifth National Congress, according to the general regulations and resolutions, it is held every two years, but in special circumstances, there is a leeway of one year. Whether to hold the meeting on schedule this year or postpone it will be decided at the next Central Standing Committee meeting. (2) The central government has repeatedly stated the purpose of cotton and wheat, which will never be used for military or political purposes but for productive enterprises and rural relief as designated by the central government. As for the incident and the Tanggu Agreement, they have become past facts and need not be detailed. (Central News Agency telegram on the 11th)</p>
<h3>Chiang Promulgates Regulations on Rewarding and Punishing Bandit Suppression</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Headquarters promulgated the regulations on rewarding and punishing civil and military officials and soldiers for suppressing bandits, ordering the provincial governments and armies in the bandit suppression areas to follow them. The original order included the sentence, "In the current dangerous situation, rewarding merit and punishing fault is necessary to change the atmosphere." (Central News Agency on the 11th)</p>
<h3>Yanping Besieged; Red Bandits Fled to West Qing</h3>

(2) Liu Jiang telegraphed that bandits attacked the east and west gates of Yanping. Our Situ Brigade quickly reinforced and the bandits suffered many casualties and were repelled. (3) The main force of the bandits is still near Yanping. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Deng Shizeng arrived in Hong Kong from the province on the night of the 10th, saying that he had come to discuss the issue of suppressing the communists with Chen Jitang and the results were good. A regiment of the Guangdong army has been stationed in Yong'an to assist. There is also a division of our army in the process of discussion. He will return to Fujian as soon as there is a ship. There have been no major battles in Yanping recently and Fuzhou is still quiet. (Central News Agency telegram on the 11th)</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>The Seawall of Jiangsu Yuan</h3>
<p>The ancients said that to govern the Yellow River is to pacify the interior; to build seawalls is to defend against the exterior. Those who govern the interior dredge obstructions to ensure flow; those who defend against the exterior anticipate threats and prepare defenses. Those engaged in water management should prioritize the interior over the exterior. Moreover, this year's Yellow River disaster has extended to three provinces, with incalculable losses. In comparison, the seawall disaster only affects a few counties such as Chongming, Chuansha, and Nanhui, which is much less severe than the Yellow River disaster. Therefore, everyone focuses on governing the Yellow River and neglects defending the sea. However, seawall disasters pose the greatest threat to the prosperity of the Jiangzhe region. All dynasties have valued this matter. If one does not anticipate threats and prepare defenses, a sudden major disaster will be overwhelming. There are precedents to learn from.</p>
<p>The Yu Gong mentions entering the sea without preventing the sea from entering; Mencius mentions pouring into the sea without preventing the sea from pouring in. It was not until the Tang and Song dynasties that people began to talk about defending the sea. The name "building seawalls to defend the sea" first appeared in the first year of Kaiyuan in the Tang dynasty. During the Shaoxing and Qiandao periods of the Song dynasty, Liu Baoqiu and Qiu Chong successively repaired them. The Ming dynasty also repeatedly expanded them. From the Chenghua to the Jiawan periods, the regulations gradually improved. By the late Qing dynasty, due to frequent dangerous projects, even greater repairs were made. People such as Zhu Shi, Li Wei, Chen Hongmou, Tao Shu, and Lin Zexu undertook major projects every few years or decades. During the Tongzhi and Guangxu periods, when Ding Richang was the governor of Jiangsu, he carried out a major repair because the seawall was collapsing and becoming increasingly severe. The project lasted twenty years before it was completed. As a result, sea disasters were slightly eased. Now, another fifty years have passed. Although there have been repairs from time to time, they have all been piecemeal minor projects. No major project has been undertaken, so the danger of today's seawalls is to be expected.</p>
<p>China has seven coastal provinces, but provinces such as Liaoning, Hebei, Shandong, Guangdong, and Fujian have not been known to build seawalls to defend against the sea. Only Jiangzhe is known for its seawalls. Among the seawalls of Jiangzhe, due to changes in the terrain, the focus has shifted to Jiangsu. The counties in Jiangsu that have seawalls are Jinshan, Songjiang (formerly Huating), Fengxian, Nanhui, Chuansha, Baoshan, Taicang, and Zhenyang Zhaowen, which are merged into Taicang Changshu. The coastline stretches for over five hundred miles. Among these counties with seawalls, Baoshan is the most dangerous, followed by Taicang and Zhenyang Zhaowen. The danger in Songjiang is due to the presence of the Jin and Sheng mountains. The danger in Baoshan and Taicang is due to the presence of the Chong and Bao sands. Water is more angry when it is restrained, and more violent when it is forced. Therefore, the tide comes like the force of heaven and retreats with the power to pull mountains. Those experienced in seawall construction say that seawalls have three fears: impact, erosion, and swirling. The tide uses the power of these three to attack the seawall, like the Dragon King using cannons and giant bombs to bombard the seawall. If there is no opposing force to defend, it is not enough to resist this foreign invasion. Therefore, the governments and local officials of past dynasties have spared no effort in manpower and financial resources to manage seawall projects. The study of methods to consolidate seawalls has also become increasingly thorough. However, the impact, erosion, and swirling of the tide erode day by day, like a daily felling. Therefore, no matter how strong the project is, no matter how complete the stone seawalls, earthen seawalls, and protective piles and dams are, after a few years or decades, they will inevitably be attacked and shaken. Today, the seawalls in various places are increasingly dilapidated and dangerous, so a major seawall repair cannot be delayed.</p>
<p>Building seawalls to defend against the sea is to help the land resist the water, not to compete with the water for land. Those who help the land resist the water often seem to be losing. Is it because the power of the water is irresistible? Or is it because human efforts are lacking? Building seawalls to defend against the sea has always been regarded as the best method, so everyone focuses on this, following the old rules without any changes. Each project is considered a rare achievement if it is stronger and more extensive than the previous one. However, its effectiveness only lasts for a few decades. Today, science is flourishing and technology is advancing. The engineering of building dikes, repairing dams, and all water management projects has surpassed the old methods of decades ago. If we can abandon the idea of clinging to old methods and concentrate human and material resources to carry out this project, I know that we will surely be able to defeat the power of the water and establish a major plan for the next century. However, today's China only knows how to treat the symptom, not the cause. Seeing the obvious and urgent disaster of the Yellow River, everyone shouts to govern the Yellow River. Seeing the hidden and slow disaster of the seawalls, they turn their heads and ignore it. Even if they strongly advocate and are fortunate enough to start construction, it will only be piecemeal minor repairs. How can we expect a major repair like before, let alone changing the tune and making a once-and-for-all plan?</p>
<p>However, the people of Jiangsu cannot ignore this matter. Although the waters of the Yellow River extended to the northern part of Jiangsu province a few days ago, the damage was minimal. Recently, although the seawalls have been in danger, the damage has only affected thousands of people and the losses are only tens or hundreds of millions. It is truly the great fortune of the people of Jiangsu. However, the arrival of disasters is often unpredictable. Once a strong wind brings huge waves, the decaying seawalls cannot resist. Then, the disaster of its collapse will be no smaller than the flooding of the Yellow River. The Higher Drainage Committee once went to the seawalls to investigate but has not been heard to have taken any action. Perhaps they are too busy with the current situation with a thousand holes and a hundred wounds to worry about this. In fact, for the sake of anticipating threats and preparing defenses, the people of Jiangsu should not ignore it.</p>
<h3>The Fifth Plenary Session May Be Postponed Again According to Regulations</h3>
<p>Related Issues Awaiting Discussion by the Central Executive Committee</p>
<p>Central Propaganda Department Hosts Journalists</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Propaganda Department hosted journalists on the morning of the 11th. Standing Committee member Ju Zheng reported that the opinions expressed by committee members Chen, Li, Wang, Jiang, and Cai Tingkai regarding the Fifth Plenary Session were all personal opinions. According to the party constitution, the plenary session should be held once a year, later amended to once every two years. It may still be postponed in case of major incidents. However, the originally scheduled Provisional National Congress on July 1st has already been postponed. If the Fifth Plenary Session in November is also postponed, how can this be justified to the representatives already elected by various provinces? Our party operates on a conference system. If the plenary session is repeatedly postponed, it would be difficult to explain to the public. Whether or not the postponement will occur still needs to be decided by the Central Executive Committee. Furthermore, the Central Government will definitely send personnel to Guangdong, and the candidates are still under consideration. Reports stating that I and Zhang Puquan will be sent together are no longer accurate. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to a certain Central Committee member, the Fifth Plenary Session is due to be held according to the party constitution. However, due to practical difficulties, it is still possible to consider postponing it for a year. Currently, we are in the midst of intense efforts to suppress bandits, and the aftermath in North China urgently requires solutions. Many responsible Central Committee members, such as Jiang and He, may not be able to spare the time to return to Nanjing. Therefore, many Central Committee members believe that since it is practically impossible to convene the session, postponing it would not violate the party constitution and is worth reconsidering. The duration of the postponement, how to handle the elected representatives, and the constitutional issues and National Assembly issues arising from the postponement of the Fifth Plenary Session will all await discussion by the Central Executive Committee.

<h3>Economic Committee's Expanded Organization</h3>
<p>Changing to a Standing Committee System Reporting Directly to the National Government</p>
<p>In Addition to the Original Three Divisions, a Secretary-General Will Be Established</p>
<p>Preparatory Director Qin Fen Issues Statement</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Lushan Conference decided to expand the National Economic Council to implement a controlled economy. Qin Fen, who is in charge of preparations for the council, participated in the discussions and followed Song to Shanghai. He has now returned to Nanjing. According to him, this proposal was put forward by Finance Minister Song, and the key figures decided on the organizational principles, changing the chairman system to a standing committee system. Premier Wang, President Sun, and Finance Minister Song were appointed on the spot to be in charge. Their scope of authority is to design matters for the control of the national economy. Whether other functions will be merged in the future is still difficult to say at this time. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Qin Fen, the preparatory director of the National Economic Council, told reporters from the Central News Agency on the 11th: (1) I previously accompanied Minister Song to Lushan, where the conference decided to expand the Economic Council's organization and change it to a standing committee system, reporting directly to the National Government, and appointed Wang, Song, and Sun as standing committee members. The Central Political Council may approve this week. (2) In addition to the original three divisions for highways, water conservancy, and hygiene, the Economic Council will establish a secretariat and another Economic Investigation Division, with three groups under it: agriculture, industry, and commerce. If specialized issues arise that require a separate division, it will also be established, but this is still under consideration. (3) The main task of the Economic Council is that all economic plans requiring the use of the national treasury must first be reviewed and approved by the council before they can be implemented. (4) The detailed plans and organizational regulations of the council will be submitted to the Central Political Council for approval next week, and the official establishment is expected in about a month. (5) The rumor that Song resigned as Finance Minister is not accurate, as Song returned to Nanjing on the 7th to resume his duties, and the Ministry of Finance will not be reduced in scope. (6) Technical experts hired from the League of Nations will be government employees. After coming to China, they will not establish separate agencies, but will work in various departments, responsible for technical planning and not interfering in administration. (7) How the cotton and wheat loan will be distributed will be determined after the government has finalized the plans. (8) The Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Communications are administrative organs specializing in administration. There have been no reports of them being reduced in scope.

<h3>The People of Fengpei County Plan to Block the Dasha River Estuary</h3>
<p>The People of Xiaodang County Rise Up in Opposition</p>
<p>Commissioner Yu Has Prohibited the Blocking of the Estuary</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) This time, the Yellow River water came east, entered the old course, and flowed into the Dasha River. Fengpei suffered, while Xiaodang suffered less because of two dams obstructing the water. Now, the people of Fengpei plan to block the Dasha River estuary and simultaneously dredge the two dams. The people of Xiaodang believe that diverting the water harms them and have risen up in opposition, separately petitioning the provincial government, the Xuzhou Garrison Headquarters, and the Commissioner's Office to stop it. Commissioner Yu Nianci has telegraphed the county magistrates of Fengpei and Xiaodang to prohibit the blocking of the Shayang River estuary and report to the provincial government for approval. Currently, the people of the four counties are gathering armed forces to prepare for a dispute over blocking the estuary. Yu has dispatched personnel to Dangshan to investigate and strictly prohibit disputes, and is awaiting further solutions. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) In the middle of last month, the Yellow River breached its banks in eastern Henan, and the water entered the old course, reaching the Gaozhai and Panlongji dams in the eastern part of Dangshan County. Due to silting downstream, it turned northeast and flowed through the Dasha River in Fengpei into the Zhaowei and Lianghu Lakes. Fortunately, Xuzhou was not affected. Now that the Yellow River water has receded, the party and government organs of Fengpei County are urgently planning to block the Dasha River channel east of Gaozhai and intend to dredge the old Yellow River channel and dikes south of the two dams, allowing the Yellow River water to flow straight down and east through the old course. Recently, the two counties have sent personnel to survey and estimate the work in the area of the two dams and have also investigated and mobilized police and militia to garrison south of the two dams, in order to implement the blocking of the Shayang River and the excavation of the old course. The entire population of Xiaodang County, believing that they are located downstream of the old course, is extremely angry. They have also gathered people, sharpened knives, and polished guns, waiting for a fight. Local organs and legal entities have jointly telegraphed Governor Gu of Jiangsu Province, Commander Zeng of Xuzhou, and Commissioner She to request a strict prohibition, stating that they have investigated and found that the north bank of the Yellow River in Dangshan County, at Panlongji, breached in the first year of Xianfeng (1851), flowing into Fengpei. At that time, the main current flooded, and the width of the river was more than twelve li. The old Yellow River has turned into a result of accumulated sediment and is more than ten feet higher than the newly formed river channel in Fengpei County. The terrain is even higher in the east with the two dams and the facing-water dam. Therefore, the Yellow River floods south to Panlongji and then enters the lake through the old Fengpei course. The nature of water is to flow downwards, which is dictated by the terrain. However, the people of Fengpei have a strange idea and want to divert the water upwards. They have even sent surveyors and police teams to measure the land along the two dams in Dangshan County and plan to send 20,000 laborers to block the Shayang River and excavate the two dams, so that the flooding Yellow River can be diverted through Dangshan and Xiaotong, avoiding harm to Fengpei. They also plan to mobilize the police and militia from the two counties, carrying ten thousand guns, to guard Dangshan, and are planning to set up a supervisor at Gaozhai and connect a telephone, and install electric lights to start work soon. The people of Xiaodang are running around sweating and are extremely indignant. They believe that along the old Yellow River course, towns and cities are densely populated. If the Fengpei diversion plan succeeds, all the towns and cities and transportation routes along the old course will be shaken and threatened every day. The two counties of Fengpei are treating their neighbors as moats and violating the nature of water, which will inevitably harm others for their own benefit. The one million people of Xiaodang can only take up arms to protect their lives and property, waiting for a fight. Now, the people of Tongshan County have also risen up in response and will unite with Xiaodang to oppose the Fengpei diversion plan. (11th Dispatch from the Central News Agency)</p>

<h3>The Question of Establishing a Diplomatic Office in Xinjiang Is Still Under Study</h3>
<p>Whether Luo and Yan Will Meet Is Also Undetermined</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to political sources, the government once had a plan to establish a diplomatic office in Xinjiang, but it is currently under study. Rumors that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been instructed to begin the establishment and that candidates for diplomatic commissioners are being selected are still premature. Whether Minister Luo and Ambassador Yan will meet is also currently undecided. Regarding our proposed proposal to the League of Nations conference, there is no concrete plan yet, and we are only studying the attitude to be taken. As for the rumor that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will negotiate with Russia to cancel the local commercial treaty in Xinjiang, that is not the case. (11th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>The United States and Japan Invite Britain to Participate in a Three-Power Naval Conference</h3>
<p>To Revise the Washington and London Treaties</p>
<p>Japan Is Carefully Studying Countermeasures</p>
<p>(London) The "Daily Mail" today reported that the United States and Japan have decided to invite Britain to participate in a new three-power conference to revise the Washington and London Naval Treaties. The newspaper stated that after Japan recently protested President Roosevelt's decision to implement a shipbuilding program costing 47 million pounds, the US and Japanese governments exchanged notes and made this decision. (11th Reuters Dispatch) (Nanjing) According to diplomatic sources, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan are vigorously expanding their armaments, and the situation on the Pacific coast is becoming increasingly tense. Although the Japanese government is outwardly maintaining calm, it is actually deeply fearful. In order to ease this sharp confrontation, the Japanese diplomatic authorities have used diplomatic means and, as a result, have obtained the agreement of the United States to convene a three-power conference in the Pacific at a suitable location to discuss all major issues between the United States, the United Kingdom, and Japan. Our diplomatic authorities are paying close attention to this news. (11th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>London Officials Deny</h3>
<p>(London) Various newspapers report that Washington and Tokyo have decided to invite Britain to participate in a new naval conference, but British officials have firmly denied this. (11th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>(Tokyo) It is reported that Japan does not want to cancel the Washington Naval Treaty, but the Asahi Shimbun reports that there is a growing movement within naval circles arguing that Japan should declare that it cannot participate in any new naval agreement according to the existing ratio. The Hochi Shimbun predicts that Japan will suggest to the signatory countries of the Washington and London Treaties early next year that a preparatory meeting should be held before the Second Washington Conference in 1935. The Hochi Shimbun also states that Japanese naval personnel are strongly demanding equality in naval armaments. The Kokumin Shimbun speculates that Japan will propose the complete abolition of warships. (11th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding countermeasures for the Second Washington Naval Disarmament Conference in 1935, the Army, Navy, and Foreign Ministries will hold their second meeting this Thursday to prepare. On that day, they will further discuss the Washington and London Treaties from a legal perspective. The issue is the relationship between the validity periods of the two treaties and the 1935 conference. Although the Washington Treaty allows any signatory country to issue a notice of termination, it remains in effect for two years after the notice. If there is no notice of termination, it remains in effect for two years after it expires. Conversely, the London Treaty only stipulates that a conference should be convened in 1935 to revise the Washington Treaty. If no conference is convened or if it ends in failure, it expires at the end of 1936. However, the provisions on battleships and aircraft carriers contained in the London Treaty are also contained in the Washington Treaty and continue to exist. Since the validity periods of the two treaties are different, Japan must carefully study its countermeasures. Although the Washington Treaty allows for a notice of termination, it remains in effect for two years. Therefore, from the end of 1936 until the treaty is terminated, any agreement on the determination of military strength, no matter what form it takes, is insignificant in this sense, so the theory of the notice of termination is not worth emphasizing. However, it is worth noting that there are those who advocate issuing a strong notice to participating countries in a suitable period before the 1935 conference, stating that Japan cannot agree to the agreement on the strength of its military forces under the existing naval treaty, which can achieve the same effect as a notice of termination.

<h3>Japan Is Building Airfields in the North</h3>
<p>Aiming at Operations Against Russia and the United States</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese military believes that the air defense at the northern end is insufficient, and it is reported that it is secretly and actively planning to build three major airfields in Sakhalin, the Kuril Islands, and Hokkaido. The locations are reportedly Higashishirikori in Sakhalin, Shumushu in the Kuril Islands, and Nemuro in Hokkaido. In addition to building air force bases in these three places, it is also planned to open commercial aviation routes: (1) from Tokyo via Aomori, Nemuro, to Shumushu, a distance of 2,100 kilometers; (2) from Tokyo via Aomori, Sapporo, to Higashishirikori, a distance of 1,370 kilometers. It is reported that in the illegal negotiations on the Sino-Eastern Railway, the Japanese military advocated forcibly seizing it, so the future of the negotiations is full of twists and turns. Even if a satisfactory resolution is reached, there are still many difficulties in Russian-Japanese relations. According to the Japanese military's speculation, Russia has already signed non-aggression treaties with various Western European countries and is also mobilizing large armies to gather on the Russian-Manchurian border, under the command of Red Army Commander-in-Chief Moloshenov, conducting large-scale exercises of the Red Army. The United States is also seizing the opportunity to get closer to Russia and intends to buy the Kamchatka Peninsula as an air force base. Russia also wants to use American capital to develop the Maritime Province to curb Japan's northward policy. Japan believes that the world situation is gradually becoming unfavorable to it, so it wants to urgently build airfields for the air defense of the northern end. It is reported that the capitalists who contracted the project, under the guidance of the military and the Aviation Investigation Committee of the Ministry of Communications, have gone north to prepare for construction.

<h3>Huge Military Budget</h3>
<p>Araki Bargains with the Finance Minister</p>
<p>(Tokyo) As a result of negotiations between the Japanese military and the Ministry of Finance, Finance Minister Takahashi has agreed that military spending takes precedence over everything else. In the budget for the next fiscal year, after deducting the military personnel needed for military spending, the remaining financial resources will be distributed to the heads of the various provinces. However, the total amount of new military spending has reached 840 million yuan. The new expenditures planned by the Japanese Ministry of Finance are around 700 million yuan. If this is the case, it will not be enough to cover all the military spending. Although the Ministry of Finance has agreed to Araki's principle, there are still many twists and turns ahead. According to Finance Minister Takahashi, this kind of problem cannot be discussed privately and should be submitted to the cabinet for discussion and decision. (11th Chinese United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After the meeting between Army Minister Araki and Finance Minister Takahashi, the main problem in Japanese political circles has shifted to the military expenditure issue. The National Alliance today issued an opinion stating that the national defense expenditure should accept the demands of the military in such an urgent autumn of internal and external circumstances. Whatever the military needs, they should accept it. As for the financial resources, they should be paid for entirely with public bonds, which is perfectly acceptable. However, this expenditure should be managed with special accounting. (11th Chinese United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The central issue of the Japanese government's budget for the next fiscal year is how to handle military spending. Of the 1.3 billion yuan of the total amount of new budgetary requests from various provinces, 370 million yuan are from the Army Ministry and 430 million yuan are from the Navy Ministry, totaling 800 million yuan, which accounts for more than 60% of the entire budget. The Accounting Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, which examines the budget, attaches great importance to this matter and has decided to start by reviewing the budget of the Navy Ministry. As for the Army, Interior, Agriculture, and Commerce Ministries, the authorities in charge of the Ministry of Finance are concerned about the future due to financial difficulties and plan to greatly reduce the budgets requested by the various provinces. However, the authorities in charge of the Army and Navy require all the funds to implement the national defense plan and future war plans. Therefore, the conflict between the military and financial authorities will inevitably intensify. Whether the two sides can compromise depends on the attitude of the military, because the military is in a passive position regarding the budget issue. Army Minister Araki's meeting with Finance Minister Takahashi on the 9th was the preliminary battle to resolve the military expenditure issue. As for the Navy, its importance to the internal and external situation is even greater than that of the Army, and it is concerned about the budgetary guidelines of the Ministry of Finance. The meeting between Navy Minister Osumi and Finance Minister Takahashi will be realized soon. However, ministers of the military and finance hope for a political solution to the military expenditure issue. Because the budget request for the next fiscal year is too large, it seems difficult to succeed. Now, both the military and the economy are serious due to the extraordinary situation and have special characteristics. To satisfy one, the other must be sacrificed. It is quite clear that this matter has a significant impact on Japan. How this problem will be resolved will be decided by the cabinet, so the results of the meeting between the finance minister and the military ministers can only be used as reference materials for the financial authorities, and it seems difficult to reach a complete consensus. The Japanese government's budget problem for the next fiscal year, which is centered on military spending, will inevitably be a fairly profound political conflict in the future.

<h3>Hugh McMurray Is Appointed as Envoy to Small Neighboring Countries of Russia</h3>
<p>Specializing in Collecting Information on Soviet Russia</p>
<p>A Prelude to the Restoration of Relations Between the United States and Russia</p>
<p>(Washington) Hugh McMurray, former US Minister to China, was today appointed by US President Kennedy as Minister to Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia. It is generally believed that this is a prelude to his appointment as Ambassador to Russia after the restoration of relations between the United States and Russia in the future. McMurray will leave for his post immediately, and it is reported that he will work with the Minister to Sweden to investigate the economic and political situation of Soviet Russia to provide a reference for the US President's decision on the issue of recognition. The US Embassy in Sweden was previously ordered to investigate the current situation of Soviet Russia, but these three embassies are closer to Russia. The main reason for McMurray's appointment today is probably this. McMurray is currently a professor at Johns Hopkins University and there has been no news of his return to public service recently. Now he suddenly accepts the mission to these three small countries, and there is no other reason besides this. McMurray has served in China, Russia, and Japan, first as secretary of the Russian Embassy, then as secretary of the Japanese Embassy, and finally as Minister to China. He is familiar with the situation in Russia and the Far East, and it is most appropriate for him to be stationed in Moscow. Otherwise, the United States has neither large-scale trade nor important diplomatic issues with these three Baltic countries, so there is no need to use retired senior officials. However, the State Department and the White House have made no comment on this move, saying that there is no news on the issue of Soviet Russia. (10th Nationalist Electric)</p>
<h3>This Year's League of Nations Assembly</h3>
<p>As a Prelude to the Disarmament Conference</p>
<p>Election of Three Non-Permanent Council Members</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Executive Council is scheduled to meet on September 22nd, and the League of Nations Assembly on September 25th. The agenda for this year's Assembly includes reports from the World Economic Conference and various other reports on purely technical matters, such as transportation, hygiene, opium trafficking, child protection, intellectual cooperation, and slave trade. The Disarmament Conference is scheduled to reconvene on October 16th, so the disarmament issue is not within the scope of the Assembly's discussions. However, according to usual practice at each League of Nations Assembly, there will be an open discussion of the Secretary-General's report. It is unknown whether speakers will touch upon the disarmament issue during such discussions. Even if there is no open discussion in the Assembly, the world's most pressing issue today is none other than disarmament. How can the Assembly not touch upon this serious issue? In short, even if the Assembly's debates and actions do not involve such issues, the Assembly's greatest concern will certainly be current political issues. This fourteenth League of Nations Assembly will serve as a prelude to the October 16th Disarmament Conference. This is almost certain. Regarding the organization of the Executive Council, this year's Assembly will elect three non-permanent representatives to the Executive Council to replace Guatemala, Norway, and Ireland, whose terms have expired. The Assembly will also accept Portugal's proposed new system, so this year the Executive Council representatives will expand to fifteen. The seat occupied by Japan in the Executive Council will be left vacant until the end of the two-year period, as the Covenant stipulates that a member state's declaration of withdrawal is only effective after two years.

<h3>Rumors of Soviet Russian Shipbuilding</h3>
<p>Japan Angered by British Machinations</p>
<p>The Tokyo Hochi Shimbun reported on the 6th that the Soviet Russian government recently ordered four 7,000-ton cruisers equipped with elite cannons and one 3,800-ton ocean-going cruiser from Italian shipyards. All ships will be deployed in the Pacific Ocean. The Navy Ministry (Japan) was shocked by this information. In addition to investigating the truth, naval authorities believe that these rumors are entirely the work of Britain. The Soviet Russian government's warship construction plan is intended by British imperialists to stimulate the Japanese military and incite the deterioration of Japanese-Soviet relations. Britain is engaging in this inflammatory behavior because the Japanese military views the Red Army in Russian territory as a threat to Japan. Furthermore, Japan has always disliked the navigation of Soviet Russian fishing boats in the ocean. Therefore, Britain fabricated the story of warship construction for use in the Sea of Japan, intending to worsen Japanese-Soviet relations. Moreover, since Japan occupied Manchuria, Britain has long been wary of the expansion of the Japanese empire. Therefore, Britain greatly desires a conflict between Japanese policy and the Soviet Union or the United States. However, Japan's overseas expansion requires the investment of huge amounts of capital, so it must seek to dump goods to make up for the shortfall. As Japanese goods are sharp and aggressively infiltrating Britain and British colonies, Britain is very jealous and is trying to undermine the possibility of a peaceful policy in the contentious issues between Japan and Russia, so Britain can profit from it.</p>

The entire Shenyang Fire Brigade, the Puppet State Garrison, Yu Zhishan's army, and Japanese-Manchu police were dispatched to put out the fire. However, because there was no water supply in the city, firefighting was not satisfactory. At 10:30 PM the fire was still burning. The museum contained many treasures from the height of the Former Qing Dynasty. (Dentsu Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<h3>Sugimura Gives a Speech Before Leaving for China</h3>
<p>Sugimura, the former Secretary-General of the League of Nations, departed yesterday for a trip to Manchuria and China. Before his departure, he told reporters that he expects China's policy towards Japan to change. Moreover, the attitudes of Britain and the United States towards China and Japan will further influence China's policy towards Japan. Now that Chinese Finance Minister Song Ziwen has returned to China after visiting Europe and the United States, he should know that both Europe and the United States are not taking steps to interfere in Far Eastern affairs. Therefore, a change in China's policy towards Japan is inevitable. He claimed that he has no preconceived notions about this trip to China and will meet with Chinese people with a sincere and open attitude. (Reuters Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<h3>Righteous Army Retreats from Dongning</h3>
<p>Well-Equipped and Waiting for a Chance to Counterattack</p>
<p>Train Derails Near Suifen Station</p>
<p>(Harbin) According to official sources today, the Japanese support forces in Suifenhe and Muling have driven back the 2,000-strong Righteous Army that occupied Dongning City a few days ago. The Righteous Army is now retreating southwest, and the number of casualties is unknown. According to military experts, the Righteous Army is well-equipped, has received training, and can concentrate such a large number of people on the border.

<h3>Puppet Organization Cracks Down on Workers Entering the Country</h3>
<p>(Dalian) It is reported that experts from the South Manchuria Railway, together with the Puppet Government authorities, are currently planning a method for laborers within Manchuria to have their fingerprints recorded. The purpose is to identify workers who leave and return, so that others cannot impersonate workers to enter the country. In the future, the entry of workers will be greatly restricted, and unemployed workers who are permanent residents in Manchuria will be utilized. It is estimated that there are currently 500,000 to 600,000 laborers in Manchuria, mostly recently from Shandong. About 120,000 of them are currently serving in national construction projects. Many workers come here in the spring and return to their hometowns in Shandong in the autumn. Officials claim that bandits often mix among the workers entering the country.

<h3>Bovine Plague in Heilongjiang Province</h3>
<p>Thousands of Deaths, Relief Efforts Exhausted</p>

Several thousand cattle have also died.

In some places, almost all cattle have died. Thirty Manchus and about ten Russians who accompanied Japanese doctors to inspect the bovine plague were infected and died. But it is now believed that the total number of deaths should be more than this. About 2,000 cattle died along the Nen River, and their bodies were mostly thrown into the river, so the spread of the plague is extremely rapid in the lower reaches. (Reuters Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<h3>German-Austrian Peace Conditions</h3>

Habicht concluded that the ultimate goal is still the merger of Germany and Austria, but Germany is willing to achieve this goal through peaceful means. Havas Dispatch, Vienna, 11th The "Zeit" newspaper published an article in response to Habicht's speech, saying that the demands put forward by Habicht can be accepted, but only after: (1) German Catholics have fully restored freedom of belief, (2) Hitler abides by the agreement concluded by the Nazi Party and the National Power Party, (3) Return the confiscated trade union assets, (4) All detained political prisoners are released. The newspaper also said, "Regarding the possibility of realizing this compromise, Habicht may reveal something to us in his next radio speech."</p>

<h3>Naval Court Concludes Trial of the May 15th Incident</h3>
<p>Prosecutor Argues for Sentencing</p>
<p>Koga and Three Others Sentenced to Death</p>
<p>Sixty Thousand Petitions for Leniency</p>
<p>China United News Agency, Tokyo, 11th: The naval perpetrators of the May 15th Incident were tried again this morning at 9:00 AM at the Yokosuka Naval Court. Prosecutor Yamamoto stood up to present his argument for sentencing. Yamamoto's argument lasted for more than three hours, until an 11:00 AM recess. China United News Agency, Tokyo, 11:00 AM: This was the 20th public trial of the naval perpetrators of the May 15th Incident. At 8:30 AM, there were 25 spectators. After the court convened at 9:00 AM, Prosecutor Yamamoto stood up to present his argument, stating that his argument was not subject to any interference and was entirely based on his own free opinion. The motives of the defendants were to eliminate the harm of political parties and financial cliques. There is no doubt that the defendants were correct in their assertions of corruption in the world, but the defendants also admitted that they had insufficient understanding of various facts. As for the right and wrong of various objective facts, it should be left to the judgment of the world. The defendants believed that only direct action could save the country from decline. This subjective argument was indeed dominated by the passion of youth, and they lost their fair judgment. There are understandable reasons for the defendants' feelings. However, from the perspective of national order, direct action is regrettable. The defendants conspired to murder, and according to the provisions of the Army Criminal Law, each is to be sentenced as follows: Navy Lieutenant Koga Kiyoshi, Navy Lieutenant Mikami Taku, and Reserve Navy Lieutenant Kuroiwa Isamu are sentenced to death. Navy Ensign Murayama Kakuji, Navy Lieutenant Nakamura Yoshio, and Navy Lieutenant Yamagishi Hiroshi are sentenced to life imprisonment. Navy Ensign Ito Kameki, Navy Ensign Ooba Haruo, and Navy Lieutenant Hayashi Masayoshi are sentenced to six years of imprisonment. Tsukano Michio is sentenced to three years of imprisonment.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Yokosuka, 11th: After the stern sentencing plea by Prosecutor Yamamoto in the naval court-martial regarding the May 15th Incident, the court adjourned at 11:01 AM and reconvened at 1:00 PM to begin the defense. First, Special Defense Counsel Captain Asada stated the following from a military perspective: Lieutenant Mikami and I were also classmates in the same class and vowed to be comrades-in-arms for the life and death of the country. These friends and relatives, seeing the clouded state of the imperial nation, transcended life and death to try to govern it. Although they are criticized for disrupting military discipline, they are determined to eliminate the dark clouds of depression and to summon a bright Showa Restoration to clarify the imperial way. Therefore, this sentiment has been the spirit of these people for eleven years and is well known to us. The reason is that the cabinet that assists His Majesty the Emperor has turned political parties into toys, and revealed policies of "selling dog meat under the banner of a sheep's head" to deceive the people. Moreover, its scandals are countless, such as the railway scandal of former Railway Minister Ogawa and former Education Minister Kobayashi, the sale of awards by the Director-General of the Honors Bureau of Amakasa, and the Tokyo municipal scandal. In addition, when concluding the London Naval Treaty, the authorities in the government clearly violated the supreme command, causing young officers to become extremely angry and determined to consolidate national defense. Captain Asada concluded his argument at 3:15 PM, and the court was adjourned.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 11th: Matsuda, Secretary-General of the Minseito Party, said of the argument for sentencing of the naval defendants that the logic was correct, the arguments were pure, and there was no need to say more, like drawing legs on a snake. Dentsu, Yokosuka, 11th: Regarding the naval defendants in the May 15th Incident, the argument for sentencing will be made soon. As of the 10th, Presiding Judge Takasu and other related judges had received as many as 60,000 petitions for leniency, only those transferred by the Navy Ministry. Among them was a petition written in blood on a handkerchief by Kojima Katsuya (15), a student at Doushi Kaisei Middle School. Other letters from all over the country requesting leniency also came like snowflakes, moving the presiding judge Takasu and other related judges considerably.</p>

<h3>American Recovery Movement Reaches Critical Stage</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 11th: The Daily Mail's famous special correspondent, Sir Frederick, telegraphed the newspaper from Washington, saying that the critical stage of President Roosevelt's National Recovery Act movement began this week. Today's activities in Washington can be compared to London at the beginning of the European War, filled with an atmosphere of fervent effort and resolute determination. The U.S. President's Office works eighteen hours a day, without slackening its work due to the intense heat. The U.S. President's staff continues to strive, resolutely destroying old habits, breaking financial doctrines, and preparing a new national history that may affect the foundation of this republic. Democracy has never possessed such great power as President Roosevelt. General Johnson's dynamic nature is a true buffer between dictators and those who resist in the industrial and financial sectors. Labor strikes are now frequently seen throughout the United States, proving the need to quickly reorganize industries. Prices have risen remarkably, but officials are not alarmed by this.</p>

The production cost is only a quarter of that of gold and silver silk fabric. It is not only cheap, but also has the characteristics of durability, water resistance, and freedom of color. It is said that it has caused a revolution in the Japanese weaving industry.</p>
<h3>East China Army Occupies Toutaogang</h3>

After a bloody battle lasting three nights, the Japanese army suffered more than 120 casualties, while the East China Army suffered more than 30 casualties and 60 injuries. The Japanese aircraft were unable to carry out their bombing due to the resistance of the East China Army aircraft. As a result of the fierce battle, the Japanese army retreated to Xiaosuifen River and urgently telegraphed the puppet capital for assistance. The East China Army temporarily did not pursue, waiting for the various routes to unite before launching a large-scale offensive for a second bloody battle. (Northeast News Agency)</p>
<h3>Japanese and Puppets Seize Gold Mines in Northern Hebei</h3>
<p>＝Organize Japanese-Puppet Gold Mining Company＝</p>
<p>＝A Total of Seven Sites Have Been Mined＝</p>
<p>＝More Than Thirty Japanese Technicians＝</p>
<p>＝More Than Two Hundred Jin of Gold Extracted Daily＝</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: After the four northeastern provinces were occupied by the Japanese, they separately exploited the mineral resources in various places. Since the Lugouqiao Incident, we have long expected that the Japanese would covet the world-renowned gold mines in northern Hebei and the rich coal mines along the Great Wall, with a view to exploiting our treasures and using them to build aggressive forces. Before the Tanggu Truce was signed, we heard that the Japanese and puppets had jointly organized a so-called "Japanese-Manchu Gold Mining Company" and dispatched technicians and workers to carry out surveys in Miyun, Zunhua, and Xinglong. Although most of the war zone has been recovered by us, the gold mine areas are still under continued occupation. According to people who have recently arrived from Zunhua, the gold mines in northern Hebei are best in Zunhua and Xinglong counties. Although Zunhua has been nominally recovered, in reality, eighty villages north of the Great Wall have not been recovered. Even the Daoliushui gold mine in the Malanyu area, located within the Great Wall, is still under the control of the Japanese army. I once tried to sneak into the gold mining site for an investigation and learned that the gold mining joint-stock company organized by the Japanese and puppets currently has seven mine shafts in the territory of Dushan, Xinglong, and Zunhua counties. There are a total of more than thirty Japanese technicians, more than ten puppet supervisors, and approximately seven hundred gold mining workers. A total of two hundred thirty to forty jin of gold can be mined from the seven sites every day. Among them is a small portion of placer gold, but the quality is exceptionally rich. Since mining began at the end of June, it has caused a sensation among the Japanese and puppet officials and people, who believe this is a sign of wealth and strength. A light railway has been built from the mining area to the Great Wall, and cars can be driven arbitrarily up and down the Great Wall. According to the people in the four counties of northern Hebei, who have strong solidarity and sufficient self-defense capabilities, the local authorities in North China once planned to jointly run the gold mines by officials and merchants and organized the Northern Hebei Gold Mining Company. The people of each county believed that the gold mines in these counties were the only way for all the people in the area to live in the future. They repeatedly jointly opposed it, and the officials planned to change it to official supervision and merchant management, which was also opposed by the county people. However, the county people themselves did not have this economic power. As a result, the mining plan was never implemented due to the preparations of the people in each county and the expression of armed opposition as a backer. Now, the mining rights have been seized by the Xun ethnicity, but there has been no expression of any kind from the people of the counties, presumably because they have been suppressed by the iron hooves of the Japanese army.

<h3>He Jian Reports on the Situation of Bandit Suppression in the Western Route</h3>
<p>＝The First Column Guards the West Bank of the Gan River＝</p>
<p>＝The Second Column's Actions Are Relatively Slower＝</p>
<p>＝The Third Column Has Recovered Damushan Mountain＝</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: The Western Route General Headquarters was established on June 1st. The headquarters of the First, Second, and Third Columns under its command were also successively formed in June. It has been more than two months since then. Regarding the progress of bandit suppression, according to He Jian's report at the expanded memorial week of the party, government, and military, it is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>(Bandit Area Situation) The bandit situation on the Western Route Army's side is roughly divided into two types: main bandits and scattered bandits. The main bandits are the so-called Red Army, originally two groups led by Kong Hechong and Li Tianzhu (now led by Xiao Ke). Each group has approximately 10,000 people, with a maximum of approximately 5,000 to 6,000 guns, and a small number of machine guns and mortars. Kong's bandits have a main force of approximately 7,000 to 8,000 people, stationed in the Xiaoyuan, Paibu, Gao Village, and Xikeng areas on the border of Pinglu in eastern Hunan and Tonggu and Wanzai in western Jiangxi. Another group of approximately 3,000 to 4,000 people is stationed in the Damushan and Huanglongshan areas on the border of Chongyang, Tongcheng, Puqi, Yangxin, and Dazhi in southern Hubei. Xiao's bandits have a main force stationed in various areas of Yongxin, Lianhua, and Ninggang in southwestern Jiangxi. The above two groups of bandits use their lairs as bases and constantly harass various places. Scattered bandits are the so-called guerrillas, red guards, young pioneers, and other miscellaneous bandit units. These scattered bandits are often scattered in fixed areas, killing, arson, robbing, scouting news, and delivering documents, specializing in assisting the activities of the main bandits. There are a large number of people scattered in the border areas of western Jiangxi, southern Hubei, and eastern Hunan, arbitrarily harassing them. Their organization is very strict and is all ruled by the so-called Soviet governments at all levels. Most of the people in the bandit areas are banditized, especially in Yongxin, Lianhua, and Ninggang in southwestern Jiangxi, where banditization is the deepest. When our army enters, they often gather to resist or use the scorched earth policy to hinder the activities of our army, which greatly increases the difficulty of our army's suppression.</p>
<h3>Suppression Status</h3>
<p>(1) The First Column is responsible for suppressing bandits in the Yongxin, Lianhua, and Ninggang area in southwestern Jiangxi. Wang Dongyuan and Chen Guangzhong's divisions have already recovered Lianhua and Ninggang. All the scattered bandits east of Chaoyougui have also been cleared. The above places are currently organizing the masses and handling all local aftermath matters to seek fundamental cleansing. Around August 11th, Xiao's bandits, seeing that the First Column was using a steady and gradual method of eliminating bandits, were extremely panicked and used its main force of approximately four regiments with four to five thousand guns, ambushing near the Meihua Mountains in western Jiangxi (hundreds of li in length) to prevent our Peng Division from advancing. The Peng Division successively defeated them, killing more than 1,500 bandits, seizing dozens of guns, and capturing many prisoners. Our army also suffered minor casualties. After being hit, the bandits fled to the vicinity of Dafuping on the border between Xia County and Ninggang, where they were again severely attacked by the Wang Division. They are now fleeing towards Yongxin, and our army is tracking and pursuing them. The most important task of the First Column is to guard the west bank of the Gan River. Now the fortifications are strong and the troops are strong. In fact, the main bandits in eastern Jiangxi cannot cross the river at present. (2) The Second Column is responsible for suppressing bandits in the northwestern Jiangxi area. I am concurrently serving as the commander of the column, and the actions are relatively slower because the transfer of various troops takes time. Now the transfer has been completed and we are besieging the bandit troops. Seeing our army approaching, the bandits are fleeing in all directions. Yesterday, I received a telegram from Tao Brigade Commander of the 19th Division, Liujiang, reporting that four to five hundred armed bandits had sneaked into Liuyang and attacked Sunjiaduan. They have been defeated, killing fifty to sixty bandits. There are also more than 1,000 pseudo-18 armed bandits who attacked Huangfang and are confronting the Li Security Regiment and the Volunteer Army guarding our blockhouse. Our side has dispatched troops to sandwich them. The scattered bandits in other places have not yet had any riots, and the local area is still quiet. The scattered bandits in Pingxiang will also be cleared in the shortest time. The car from Pingxiang to Nanchang can pass without hindrance. (3) The Third Column is responsible for suppressing bandits in southern Hubei. The divisions under the command of Commander Chen's column set off separately on the 10th of last month to besiege the Damushan bandit lair. The mountain peaks are extremely high, and the mountain range is very large, stretching for more than 600 li. Our army is making efforts to suppress them, and has successively destroyed many bandit lairs, killing more than a thousand bandits, seizing dozens of guns and four mortars, and capturing more than 400 bandits alive. On the 29th of last month, the mountain was completely recovered. Most of the bandits have been defeated, and the remnants are now disintegrating into zero to try to survive. Commander Chen's column has ordered the local garrison to strictly clear them and handle the aftermath to eliminate their roots. Southern Hubei is expected to be completely cleared in the near future. In addition to the above-mentioned bandit suppression situation, there are also two things about local security. (1) A thousand or so of He Long's bandits sneaked into Wangjiachang, Songzi, Hubei, and the border of Hunan a few days ago, and the area of Jinfeng was uneasy. Our corps have rushed to suppress them, and He's bandits have fled to Hefeng. The main force of He's bandits stationed in the border area of Laifeng Longshan is currently being besieged by our 34th Division and the armies of Hubei Province, and it is not difficult to defeat them. (2) Chen Wu's department in Zhijiang was disarmed by our Li and Chen brigades on the 25th of last month. Chen Wu was taken advantage of by villains when the Guangdong and Guangxi armies were preparing to enter Hunan and resist Japan last time, thinking that there would be some changes in Hunan, so he dared to take the opportunity to rebel in western Hunan. When the provincial army entered the suppression, Chen's department entrenched in Zhijiang County, relying on its dangerous and solid defenses, hoping to wait for the situation to change. The provincial army had planes and artillery, and it was not difficult to bomb them, but because of the civilians in the city, they could not bear to bomb them. The siege lasted for nearly two months, and fortunately, the officers and soldiers worked hard to climb the city and recaptured Zhicheng on the 25th of last month. Most of the rebel army has been disarmed, and Chen has only led a small number of rebel soldiers to escape. They are currently being hunted down. In addition, there is a small group of bandits in Huaihua, and Zhou Yucheng's department has fled to the border of Mayang. It is also reported that Yan Zhongru is collecting bandits in western Hunan. Li is now dispatched to Hongjiang to clear the remnants of the bandits and handle the aftermath. It is expected that the order in western Hunan will be completely restored. (September 8th)</p>
<h3>Weng Zhaoyuan Appointed Commander of Fuzhou City Defense</h3>
<p>The Public Security Bureau's Lianjia Committee is Also Established</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Recently, due to the tense military situation of bandit suppression in northern Fujian, the hearts of the people in the provincial capital have suddenly become turbulent, and the money market has become very tight. The Pacification Headquarters specially appointed Weng Zhaoyuan as the commander of the city defense, placing the 61st Division's Wu Kangnan Regiment of the 19th Route Army and the Sun Lanquan Regiments of Chen Ren's Replacement Division under his command. Weng immediately set up a department in the Donghu barracks on the 5th and began to work. The Lianjia Committee organized by the Public Security Bureau of the provincial capital was also established on the 5th. Qiu Zhaochen, the Director of the Public Security Bureau, was appointed as the chairman of the committee, and an order was issued that Lianjia offices should be established in all neighborhoods to prevent petty theft. The First Fleet Commander Chen Jiliang, led by six ships, also arrived in Fujian on the 5th. However, those who moved and relocated were still constantly on the road. Although the Pacification Headquarters, the Provincial Government, the City Defense Headquarters, and the Public Security Bureau of the provincial capital issued notices to stop them, they were still ineffective. Most of the various industries and commerce are in a state of stagnation. (September 7th)</p>
<h3>Guangdong Army Deploys Defenses on the Fujian-Guangdong Border</h3>
<p>＝Because the Fujian Bandits Invaded Yanping, the Situation is Tense＝</p>
<p>＝Li Yangjing Changes to Luofu Mountain for Recuperation＝</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The Minxi Communist bandits have invaded Yanping again, and the Guangdong border defense is becoming increasingly tense. In addition to rushing to build border fortifications, bunkers, and trenches, the Southern Route Bandit Suppression Army has also added airfields in various places. At the moment, the project has been completed in order. The air force has the Fourth Team Xie Mang Department in Dongjiang, the Fifth Team Wu Jianwen Department, the Third Team Tao Zuode Department in southern Jiangxi, and the Second Team Ding Jixu Department in Beijiang. In order to increase the strength of the infantry in front, the headquarters ordered the artillery battalions of each army to rush to the front. After receiving the order, the troops departed from the province during the day. The Independent Third and Fourth Divisions stationed in Beijiang will transfer a portion of their troops to southern Jiangxi. The Wang Dinghua Regiment stationed in Dongjiang is also preparing to move to the Fujian-Jiangxi border during the day. Li Yangjing, the commander of the Third Army, was previously suspected by Chen Jitang of supporting Li Jishen, so he has been recuperating in the Yi Yangyuan. It has been eight months. In July, he left the garden for a while. Soon after, he moved to the Meihua Village outside the East Suburb. Recently, because the Mei Hua Village residence is close to the city area, he changed to Luofu Mountain, which borders Zengcheng Boluo in Dongjiang, for recuperation. He set off from the province on the 3rd of this month. Chen Jitang's Chief of Military Law Li Guocai, Deng Qingbiao, Director of the Rear Office of the Third Army, and his wife and children were traveling with him. In addition, there was a company of military police machine guns and a special service battalion of the Third Army for consolidation. When Li boarded the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, he first returned to his hometown of Dongbei Wangyuan, took a three-day rest, and then left for Luofu Mountain on the morning of the 6th. At noon, he arrived at Chongxu Temple at the foot of the mountain. After Li entered the mountain, all military affairs of the Third Army were temporarily presided over by Huang Zhiwen, commander of the Eighth Division. The position of commander of the Second Column was assumed by the Chief of Staff of the Third Army. All bandit suppression work was kept out of the way by Li, and it is strange that he had been recuperating for more than eight months. (September 6th)</p>
<h3>Guangdong Provincial Bank Consolidates Central Bank Notes</h3>
<p>All Central Bank Notes to Stop Registration on Schedule</p>
<p>Another Method of Returning Cash for Deposits is Formulated to Recover Central Bank Notes</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The Central Bank notes of the former Guangdong Provincial Central Bank were stopped from circulation after the Central Bank was changed to the Provincial Bank. The Provincial Bank was responsible for registering the Central Bank notes and redeeming them on schedule. It has been eight months since it was handled, and the number of redemptions will be completed soon. Recently, in order to complete the handling as soon as possible, the Provincial Bank specially issued a notice to stop the registration of Central Bank notes, and another method for returning cash was formulated. The notice stated that the bank had decided to stop registering the one-yuan, five-yuan, fifty-yuan, and one-hundred-yuan Central Bank notes simultaneously from the 11th of this month to end the registration. Those who have already registered can still wait for the date and number to be compiled on a monthly basis and go to the Provincial Bank for verification and redemption. As the five-yuan Central Bank notes remain in the market in a large number, and the fifty-yuan Central Bank notes are also registered together with the five-yuan notes, in order to sort them out and complete the task as soon as possible, the bank has formulated the following methods for returning cash for five-yuan and fifty-yuan Central Bank notes: (1) In order to sort out the five-yuan and fifty-yuan Central Bank notes and shorten the verification and redemption period, the Provincial Bank will, in addition to verifying and redeeming them in the order of registration numbers, also hold five-yuan and fifty-yuan Central Bank note deposits, and regularly return cash to end the process quickly. (2) Anyone holding five-yuan and fifty-yuan Central Bank notes, whether they have been registered or not, may deposit them into this bank together with 50% of the value in five-yuan and fifty-yuan Central Bank notes and 50% in silver dollars. The bank will issue a receipt for the full amount as a silver dollar deposit, and the funds will be fully refunded in cash after a deduction of four months from the date of deposit. (3) When depositors deposit five-yuan and fifty-yuan Central Bank notes and silver dollars into this bank, they should fill out the seal and save it with the bank for verification when returning the cash. (4) The maximum total amount of deposits collected each day is provisionally set at 100,000 yuan for adjustment. (5) After this deposit expires, depositors may go to the bank to withdraw cash with proof at any time during the bank's business hours. There is no fixed deadline and no notice will be issued to solicit claims. (September 7th)</p>
<h3>Quelling Remaining Defeated Soldiers in Anhui</h3>
<p>=Local Authorities Handling Aftermath=</p>
<p>=Relief for Disaster Victims After Looting=</p>
<p>Correspondance from Bengbu: The routed soldiers from Henan Province led by Cheng Fan, who disturbed the Anhui region, have been driven back to Luyi County in Henan Province through the joint efforts of Henan and Anhui troops. Fuyang and Yingshang counties, which suffered severe devastation, are now gradually stabilizing. In the border areas of Guoyang and Mengcheng, the people were greatly alarmed and the local authorities were extremely tense due to the accumulated bandits among the routed soldiers who intended to intrude. The bandit group was then tracked and pursued by the troops suppressing the bandits and the security teams, and the bandits fled westward. According to the person in charge of the Provincial Security Office, the routed soldiers and accumulated bandits who recently harassed the Anhui region used the name of the Anti-Japanese Allied Army. Fortunately, with the cooperation of various troops, the bandits did not succeed. The remaining bandits staying in the Fuyang-Taihe region have been continuously suppressed and eliminated by Cheng Ziyi's unit of the Henan Security Detachment, Zu Xinzhai's 1st Regiment of the Anhui Provincial Security Team, and Ni Rongxian's 2nd Regiment. There are no longer any traces of bandits in the area. Luo Jingyou, the administrative inspector of the 7th District of Anhui Province, is currently comforting the displaced people and handling the aftermath. The relief commissioners sent by the Anhui Provincial Government and the Provincial Relief Association to Fuyang have also arrived and are currently engaged in investigating and distributing relief to the disaster victims after the looting. Jiang Yi, the director of the Changhuai River Police Bureau, who went to Hao County for inspection, returned to Bengbu by boat today (the 10th). According to him, the bandits in the Guoyang-Mengcheng area have all been scattered and will be completely quelled within days. (September 10th)</p>
<h3>Shaanxi Disaster Areas Appeal for Relief</h3>
<p>丨Serious Disaster Conditions in Various Counties丨</p>
<p>Correspondance from Xi'an: Shaanxi Province has suffered three severe floods in the past two months, especially the Wei River basin, which has been heavily affected. The summer harvest has already been poor in various counties, and the autumn crops have been washed away by the floods, leaving nothing behind. The situation is more serious than ever before. Now, the counties that have survived the disaster are sending urgent telegrams and letters requesting relief. The following are excerpts from the relief request telegrams and letters from Lintong, Fengxian, and other places:</p>
<h3>Lintong</h3>
<p>The Lintong County Party Affairs Guidance Office telegraphed the Provincial Relief Association on August 14th, stating that the county along the Wei River had suffered severe floods, requesting a large sum of money for emergency relief.</p>
<h3>Fengxian</h3>
<p>In Fengxian, on August 30th, at 4:00 PM, heavy rain fell, causing mountain streams to surge violently, reaching a height of about 30 feet. The floodwaters split into two streams, one flowing from the Telou River and the other flowing from Kuangouzi through Tougou, Ergou, and Sangou, all entering the Baishui River. Houses and utensils were completely submerged, and livestock were swept away by the current, resulting in significant deaths. Fertile land has been turned into rocky beaches and rivers. The devastation is so unprecedented and severe that it has set a new record for Fengxian. Emergency relief is urgently needed.</p>
<h3>Dali</h3>
<p>On August 8th, at 12:00 AM, the upstream waters of the Luo River surged violently, rising more than 10 feet high, overflowing in all directions. All the more than forty villages along the banks in the eastern, western, southern, and northern districts of the territory were turned into a watery expanse. The crops and autumn harvest were completely submerged.</p>
<p>Livestock and utensils were swept away by the current, and the collapse of houses and the loss of property are even more difficult to calculate. The plight of tens of thousands of disaster victims crying out for food is truly unbearable to hear. The Dali authorities, in their eagerness to provide relief, have temporarily set up a reception center. It is also reported that the county party headquarters and the county government have urgently requested the province to allocate a large sum of money to carry out relief efforts.</p>
<h3>Bin County</h3>
<p>From August 6th to 9th, the Jing River in Bin County rose sharply, with the width of the water level several times greater than that of the Yellow River. More than a hundred people were drowned, and several thousand mu of autumn crops along the river were completely submerged. The severity of the flood is many times greater than the droughts in recent years. It is reported that the county has submitted a report to the Provincial Government and the Relief Association, earnestly requesting relief.</p>
<h3>Suide</h3>
<p>The Suide County Magistrate recently submitted a report to Chairman Shao, Director Yang, Director Hu, Director Zhao, Director Ning, and the Provincial Relief Association, stating that the entire county had suffered severe floods and requesting emergency relief to save the disaster victims.

<h3>Baocheng</h3>
<p>In early August, there was a heavy rainstorm, and</p>
<p>mountain floods suddenly arrived, with water depths exceeding ten feet. Many people became victims of the waves. The documents, public goods, and clothing of the officials in the area were completely washed away. The crops in the entire area were submerged and withered, and houses collapsed, leaving the people without shelter. A detailed survey of the disaster situation is currently underway.</p>

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Compensation for the Tragic Death of Telephone Workers</p>
<p>Near the city's gunpowder bureau and the tax police officers' training institute, a broken electric light line was hanging down, resting on the telephone line, preventing it from functioning. The telephone company dispatched five technicians to repair it, and immediately notified the electric light company to close the section's circuit breaker to prevent danger. However, it was dark at the time, and the telephone workers mistakenly believed that the circuit breaker had been closed. As they started repairs, workers Chen Huigen and Wu Ahe were successively electrocuted and killed. The families of the deceased, especially the elderly and young, relied on the deceased for their livelihood. Hearing of the tragic death, they wailed in sorrow, and onlookers cried out for justice on their behalf. The telephone company held a shareholders' meeting yesterday to discuss compensation issues. According to regulations, each family will receive a funeral grant of one hundred yuan and six months' salary. However, after deducting the funeral expenses, the family will receive very little. Therefore, Zhu Jiuwang, the manager of the telephone company, contacted Manager Gong of the electric light company to request additional compensation to support the lives of the bereaved families. However, no results have been achieved yet.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Eight People Bitten by a Mad Dog</p>
<p>Mad dog attacks on people are frequently heard in this region. Any delay in treatment can be fatal. The harm they cause is terrifying. Lu Heshang, a resident of the Hua Dafang Village in Xin'an Township, District 13, is a butcher. The other day, he went to the Lu family in Yuantang Bridge to buy a large pig. As he was leaving, he suddenly saw a dog, completely black, baring its teeth and claws, jumping and roaring like thunder. It appeared mad. Lu was about to dodge, but it was too late. He was bitten in the foot, suffering a severe wound with blood gushing out. The next day, the mad dog ran to Qianbing Bridge and bit a Chen family child in the head. Then, it went to the Xue Dian Bridge area and bit people randomly. In total, eight people were bitten. The mad dog has now been killed by the villagers. The eight injured people will travel together to Langshan in Nantong for treatment.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>

<h3>Villager Commits Suicide Due to Economic Pressure</h3>
<p>Zhang Wuda, a villager from Xizhuang Township, District 7 of Wuyi, nearing sixty years of age, has been suffering from illness and economic difficulties. He planned to sell his fields, but no one inquired about them. He hanged himself the night before. The next morning, neighbors went inside to check on him and found him hanging naked by the side of the bed, already dead. Everyone was saddened by this.</p>
<h3>Jiading</h3>
<p>Abortion Leads to Death, Body Hidden in Ruined Shack</p>
<p>Chen Xiao, a carpenter from the Fan Chen residence northeast of Nanxiang in this county, has been a fugitive since being wanted for extortion and murder a few years ago. His wife, Zhang, aged twenty-nine, could not get used to sleeping alone after her husband left. She became intimate with a certain Jia from her clan and became pregnant after four months. Fearing her husband's condemnation upon his return, Jia took her to Shanghai for an abortion. Introduced by someone on the twenty-second of last month, they returned to Jinjia Village, northeast of Fangtai in this county, and commissioned the midwife Zhu Zhang to perform the procedure. First, she administered some kind of medication, followed by a surgical operation on the twenty-fourth, inserting some kind of bone instrument into her vagina to induce the fetus to descend. Chen Zhang cried out in pain and died. After causing the accident, Zhu Zhang and Jia buried the body in the fields at midnight. Their actions were spotted by a fisherman. Later, the corpse rotted, emanating a foul odor. Passersby inquired with the fisherman and learned the secret, which spread far and wide. Zhu Zhang then moved the body and buried it in a bean field elsewhere. The Fangtai Public Security Substation learned of the situation and detained Zhu Zhang's fourteen-year-old daughter, Caiying. Using certain methods, they obtained all the details. The county Public Security Bureau reported the matter to the county government. On the ninth, Investigator Zhang led officials to the site for an on-site examination. A child's foot was found in the deceased's lower body, proving that the deceased was indeed Chen Zhang and had died from injuries sustained during the abortion. The death certificate was immediately filled out, and burial arrangements were ordered. Zhu Zhang and Zhu Caiying were both taken into custody for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou</h3>
<p>Patrol Officer Accused, Department Orders Investigation</p>
<p>Zhang Xiangling, the patrol officer of the 4th Public Security Substation in this county, was previously accused by citizens Wang Shoushan and others of illegal detention and fines, abuse of power, and harming the people. They requested that the county be ordered to remove him from his post and severely punish him. It is now heard that the Public Hearing Office has ordered the county government to conduct a thorough investigation and report back for review and action.</p>
<h3>Police Team Accidentally Kills Fisherwoman</h3>
<p>Several bandits suddenly arrived in Zhongzhuang, District 7 of the County School, demanding that the village raise 3,000 yuan within ten days and send it to the river crossing, or they would set the entire village on fire. The villagers were extremely alarmed and reported to the county government, which sent a police team to be stationed there. The other day, a small fishing boat was moored on the river below the village, with a mother and son on board. When the police team patrolled to that location, they asked about the boat. Unexpectedly, the fisherman's son answered "Brothers," leading the police team to suspect they were bandits and open fire. The bullets pierced the fisherman's son's leg and struck the fisherwoman in the abdomen. The fisherwoman died on the spot. How tragic!</p>
<h3>Rugao</h3>
<p>Major Flooding in Beikan Town</p>
<p>In Beikan, Rugao County, a hurricane suddenly struck on the night of the 6th, causing a sudden surge in the sea, with tremendous momentum. The residents of the area were awakened from their dreams and looked around. In an instant, the tide surged, as if galloping horses, and crossed the Fan Gong embankment, entering Beikan Town. In a moment, the place became a vast expanse of water, becoming a wetland. Only the thirty-odd households in Wan'erdun were not flooded. The losses were enormous. Today (the 8th), the storm has subsided, and the water is gradually receding. In addition to urgently telegramming the county government for relief, the local public office has strictly ordered the laborers to set up defenses to prevent the unexpected.</p>
<h3>Jiashan</h3>
<p>Robbery of Fishing Boat, Four Lives Shot</p>
<p>Luhu, where this county borders Wujiang, is a water town infested with bandits. Yesterday, a case of robbery and murder of four people occurred in Yinzi Village, south of the town. The victim was a Mr. Gu, who was a fisherman, living on his boat. Besides his wife, there were also his octogenarian mother and three-year-old child. Unexpectedly, yesterday they encountered a pirate ship, which blocked them, robbed them, and then shot and killed the Gu family, all four lives, abandoning the bodies on the shore, and sailing away.</p>
<h3>Discussing County-Wide Grain Storage for Famine Relief</h3>
<p>The county government, upon receiving instructions from the province to prepare for grain storage as a vital policy for famine relief, convened a county administrative meeting: (1) The first phase will require the solicitation of 70,042 shi of grain, to be completed within one month; (2) The shortfall of over 60,000 shi will be filled in two ways: first, converting the value of rice from district farmers into grain; second, each township office should independently store grain according to the population it serves; (3) Each mu of land will be assessed one sheng of dried grain, which can be substituted with brown rice. This will be collected by the township police and supervised by township citizens, borne by the property owners, and deducted from the tenants' rent payments.</p>
<h3>Appealing for Reduction of Land Tax Surcharges</h3>
<p>The various surcharges on land tax in this county, such as education, autonomy, construction, pest control, and water conservancy, are numerous and exceed the principal tax by more than half. Numerous requests for reduction have not only been denied, but this year, the cost of the security corps has increased by one jiao per mu, and the aviation donation for farmers has increased by two fen per yuan. Furthermore, the expenses for rural primary schools are also included in the collection of land tax. This county is a heavily taxed area, and with poor harvests and famine, the rural areas are bankrupt and cannot bear repeated burdens. Yesterday, citizens such as Jiang Shusen submitted separate petitions to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the provincial government, appealing for reduction to alleviate the people's distress.</p>
<h3>Economic Hardship Forces Suicide</h3>
<p>In Nancheng, this county, there was a Huai Bingwen, who was fifty-five years old. He had one son and one daughter. Besides his elderly wife, he also had his mother-in-law living with him. He used to run a sauce garden, but due to the business downturn in recent years, all the shops were cutting back, and Huai closed his business and returned home. From then on, his economic situation became more strained. As a last resort, he made a living as a street vendor. Due to his old age and declining strength, his meager earnings were barely enough. Yesterday, he was unable to make ends meet and asked relatives for a loan, but he was rejected. He panicked and decided on suicide. As expected, he hanged himself in the middle of the night when everyone was asleep. When he was discovered, he had already died. He had no money for a coffin or funeral. His wife had to beg for donations to purchase a coffin. How tragic!</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>The Bizarre Case of the Beautiful Corpse and Jade Arm</p>
<p>The Yuehua Barber Shop at No. 77 Guanchiao Straight Street in Hangzhou was just opened last month. Yesterday morning (the 11th) at 8:00 AM, due to the need to install water pipes, the mason Wu Ziqing was digging a hole. Suddenly, half a foot below the ground, he discovered the arm of a female corpse, which had not rotted. Because the fingernails were very long, it was estimated that the body had been buried there for several years. The police learned of this and took the shop owner Yu Degui, the mason Wu Ziqing, and the landlord Chen Pinshan to the police station, where Officer Hong conducted an interrogation. It is still difficult to find clues in this bizarre corpse case.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Remaining City Walls Offered for Tender at Reduced Price</p>
<p>The remaining city walls from the West Gate to the South Gate in Jiaxing are now being demolished in accordance with orders. The county construction department surveyed and measured the area and divided it into twenty-four sections, estimating the value for bidding. The County Construction Committee decided to solicit bids for demolition. Unexpectedly, at the opening of bids the other day, only seventeen sections passed. Contracts have already been signed and the demolition is being urged. The remaining sections that did not pass are now being re-offered for tender at a 10% discount off the original bid price due to the sharp drop in brick prices, as decided by the County Construction Committee yesterday. The reasons for the discount will be reported to the Construction Department for record.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>Assassination Case Occurs Outside the South Gate</p>
<p>On the evening of the 9th, in the Ren'an Yan area outside the South Gate, a guest merchant, Xia Changgui, suddenly used a kitchen knife in a small boat to slash at his guest, Chen Chuyi, removing a large piece of Chen's brain. Blood flowed non-stop, and Chen fell to the ground unconscious. Chen's wife, Jiang, cried loudly for help. By the time the villagers arrived after hearing the cries, Xia had already fled far away. Chen's wife has now reported to the county for an autopsy. The assailant's injuries are very serious, and there are concerns about his life.</p>
<h3>Mingguang</h3>
<p>The Entire Village of Da Cai Robbed</p>
<p>In Dacaiying in the east, at about 10:00 PM last night (the 5th), more than a dozen bandits suddenly arrived and searched house to house, robbing them and abducting Chen Shoutian, Li Fengchi's wife, Wang Qichang's wife, and his daughter-in-law, a total of four people.</p>

<h3>Sun's Departure from Shanghai</h3>
<p>Before departing from Shanghai for Hangzhou, Sun Tonggang had originally planned to depart at 9:00 AM, but it was later changed to 10:00 AM. When Sun and his classmate Wang Zuwen arrived at Hongqiao Airport, Lin Wojiang, the Secretary-General of the Aviation Association, Xie Qi, the Director of the Consolidated Tax Bureau, Wang Yuanlong of the United Company, and his wife Tan Shaoji, as well as movie star Tan Xuerong, also arrived to see them off at the airport. Ms. Tan presented Sun with a bouquet of flowers, and the Star Film Company made a farewell film of Sun for commemoration. Sun then shook hands with each of the well-wishers, bidding them farewell. Amid the cheers, he flew the aircraft into the air, circled the field several times, repeatedly waving his hands, reluctant to leave, before heading south. At that time, Chen Wenlin, the director of the Naval Aviation Department, was test flying the Jiangque aircraft, which had been repaired. He also approached to shake hands with Sun before Sun boarded the aircraft. He then flew the aircraft, accompanying Sun for several circles around the field, seeing him off a distance. As Sun and Chen were departing at the same time to undertake the grand mission of circumnavigating the country, they made a passionate arrangement to meet in Fujian Province when the opportunity arose.</p>

From Lanzhou, I will turn back and fly to Bian, then to Baoding, Datong, Zhangjiakou, Suiyuan, and then to Beiping. After visiting the war zone in Beiping, I will fly to Tianjin and then directly back to Jinan. (Q) What are your plans after completing the national flight, sir? (A) To study aircraft manufacturing in Germany, which will take four years to graduate. According to Wang Zuwen, I will continue to help Mr. Sun complete the national flight to draw the attention of compatriots nationwide to national salvation and construction. After completing the flight, I may continue my studies or serve in the country. No decisions have been made yet. It is also learned that Mr. Sun has received enthusiastic assistance from all sides for this trip, so after several years, he will return to meet with the people in a grand undertaking to circumnavigate the world.</p>
<h3>Chen and Pan Fly to Beijing</h3>
<p>Chen Wenlin, the Director of the Xiamen Naval Aviation Department, and Pan Dingxin, the head of the mechanical section, departed from Xiamen on July 20th, flying the self-made Jiangque aircraft. On the 25th, they arrived in Shanghai via Fuzhou, Wenzhou, and Nanjing. The original engine of the aircraft had 85 horsepower, which was not suitable for long-distance flight, so it was replaced with a 120-horsepower engine in Shanghai. The delay lasted until now, more than a month. It was not until the day before yesterday that the installation was completed. Chen Wenlin, the Director of the Naval Aviation Department, test-flew at Hongqiao Airport at about 10:00 AM yesterday, and flew Sun Tonggang to near Jiaxing before returning to Shanghai, landing at Hongqiao Airport, very satisfied. Then, at 2:25 PM, he officially took off with the head of the mechanical section, Mr. Pan Dingxin, leaving Shanghai for Beijing. Those who went to Hongqiao Airport to see them off included Li Shijia, the Vice Minister of the Navy, Zeng Yijing, the Director of the Naval Aircraft Manufacturing Department, and many of Chen's relatives and friends.</p>
<h3>Planned Itinerary</h3>
<p>Chen Wenlin originally planned to travel with Sun Tonggang, but since their itineraries are different, he decided to fly separately. Chen</p>
<p>estimates that he will be able to reach Nanjing at about 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon. This morning, he will take off from Beijing and go directly to Beiping. He will stay in Beiping for about three days before returning to Shanghai via Tianjin and Qingdao, and then returning to Xiamen via Zhejiang. He will then fly to South China. The reporter met Chen Wenlin at the airport yesterday, who said that after arriving in Beijing this time, he will stay for one day. The next morning, he will depart from Beijing, passing through Xuzhou, Jinan, and Tianjin, to reach Beiping. Then, he will return to Shanghai from Beiping via Tianjin and Qingdao. The estimated itinerary is about one week. At that time, he will still land at Hongqiao Airport, stay in Shanghai for one day, and then go south through Hangzhou, Ningbo, and Wenzhou to return to Xiamen. He will then fly to Shantou, Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Wuzhou, and other places. After reaching Liuzhou, he will turn back and fly to Hankou, turning to Shanghai along the Yangtze River, and then returning directly to the Xiamen Naval Aviation Department to complete the national flight plan. After success, he will build a larger aircraft and then make a round-the-world flight.</p>
<h3>Regular Inspection of Disaster Areas by the Yellow River Flood Relief Committee</h3>
<p>Dispatching Four Chinese and Foreign Personnel</p>
<p>To Inspect by Plane Tomorrow</p>
<p>To Implement Relief Measures</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 8:00 AM, Mr. Song Ziwen convened a meeting of the Yellow River Flood Relief Committee at his residence. Last week, the committee, based on aerial survey maps of the disaster area provided by the General Staff Headquarters, dispatched disaster relief, work relief, and medical relief teams to conduct on-site investigations. Each team has been submitting daily reports to Shanghai. Currently, the committee, based on these reports and reports from various provincial authorities and charitable organizations, has decided on a policy of implementing disaster relief, work relief, and medical relief simultaneously. The disaster relief will focus on providing food, clothing, and sanitation, while the work relief will initially focus on堵塞breaching points. Areas in Jinan and Ningyang in Shandong, and Lanfeng in Henan, and a certain location in Hebei have been selected for establishing offices. Work has already begun on producing 100,000 sets of cotton clothing to protect disaster victims from the cold. The sanitation teams are also organized and ready, and will depart for various areas in a few days. It is reported that the committee has only 4 million yuan allocated by the government for relief funds. This will only allow for selective repairs of existing embankments. The fundamental plan for managing the Yellow River requires substantial funds and time, so it must be postponed. It is planned to submit a proposal to the government in the coming days to establish a unified water conservancy organization to manage the nation's waterways, ensuring that rivers like the Yangtze, Huai, and Han can flow freely without flooding. The committee believes that due to the decline in commerce in recent years and the accumulation of disasters, various sectors in the country are either making repeated donations or unable to donate. Therefore, it has been decided not to solicit donations from the public, request the government to establish special disaster taxes, or forcibly deduct salaries from officials for disaster relief purposes. However, the committee will gratefully accept donations from philanthropists willing to contribute, thanking them on behalf of the disaster victims. Current estimates indicate that 6 million square meters of land are submerged, and 2 million people are homeless. The depth of the disaster is truly deplorable. However, the committee's goal is to have the government bear the full cost of all relief efforts. Although this year's Yellow River flood is not as extensive as the Yangtze, Huai, and Han River floods of 1931, the impact of the disaster is severe. The most severely affected provinces are Shandong, Henan, and Hebei. At the end of last month, the Yellow River Conservancy Commission commissioned the Aerial Survey Office of the General Staff Headquarters to survey the disaster area by air. According to their measurements, the area affected by flooding was approximately 6 million square meters. Based on the average population density, approximately 2 million disaster victims were displaced and homeless. However, the water had already receded significantly by then, so the extent of flooding must have been greater when the Yellow River flood was at its peak. For the sake of relief, the National Government will establish a Yellow River Flood Relief Committee under the Executive Yuan to handle disaster relief, work relief, and medical relief. At that time, Minister Song had just returned from a mission to Europe and America. The government, recognizing Song's successful experience in handling the Yangtze River floods, which was admired both domestically and internationally, specially invited Song to be the chairman of the committee. Song, recognizing the widespread suffering of the disaster victims and the urgent need for relief, accepted the position despite his busy schedule. Before departing for the Lushan Conference, he officially assumed office. He dispatched three teams to the disaster area to investigate the situation and appointed Chinese and foreign committee members and selected experienced assistants. It is reported that after Song returned to Shanghai from the Lushan Conference, he immediately began reviewing reports from all sides and planning the implementation of relief efforts. Every morning at 8:00 AM, he convenes key officials of the committee to discuss these matters. The initial plans have been decided, and Liu Ruiheng, Zhou Xiangxian, Xi Dejiong, and a foreign relief expert (name withheld) have been assigned to fly to Jinan and Kaifeng on the 13th to discuss the implementation of relief measures and inspect the latest flood conditions. The organization of the committee is reportedly being finalized, with the following key officials: Zeng Rongpu as the director of the general office and head of the general affairs group, Qin Fen as the head of the finance group, Xi Dejiong as the head of the disaster relief group, Zhou Xiangxian as the head of the work relief group, and Liu Ruiheng as the head of the sanitation group. It is also reported that Edward and An Xianjin, chief committee members dispatched by the China International Famine Relief Commission, arrived in Shanghai to meet with Song and discuss cooperation in relief efforts. The two arrived in Shanghai last night.</p>

<h3>Urgently Repairing Baoshan Seawall Requires Over 500,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>The Length of the Damaged Section Reaches 2,780 Zhang</p>
<p>The Provincial Allocation of 60,000 Yuan Is Far from Sufficient, Telegram Sent to Nanjing Requesting Funds</p>
<p>The Baoshan County seawall was damaged in many places due to the hurricane on the 2nd of this month. The Construction Department immediately dispatched technician Zhang Junsheng to Baoshan for an on-site inspection. The total length of the damaged section is 2,780 meters. Even temporary repairs require over 500,000 yuan. The provincial allocation of only 60,000 yuan is far from sufficient. The Seawall Protection Committee convened an emergency meeting and decided to send telegrams to the Executive Yuan and the Ministries of Finance and Interior to request funds. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Length of Damaged Section</h3>
<p>After arriving in Baoshan, Construction Department technician Zhang Junsheng, together with county government technician Bao Hui　, local representatives Dong Weicheng, Wu Zhixiao, and Tao Yunming, jointly inspected the damaged sections in detail.

<h3>Relieving Disaster Victims</h3>
<p>In Changxing, Ping An, Shitou, and other five sandbars, 50-60% of the houses were destroyed by the lake on the 2nd of the month. All the embankments were destroyed. 50-60 people died and countless were injured. Upon receiving the report, the county government convened a meeting and decided to use 1,000 yuan from the accumulated grain funds for relief. Two representatives from the county government, two from the First District Office, one from the People's Education Center, one from the Property Office, and one from the County Party Headquarters departed at 6:00 AM the day before yesterday to inspect and provide relief.</p>
<h3>Seawall Protection Conference</h3>
<p>The Baoshan Seawall Protection Committee convened an emergency meeting the day before yesterday. Wang Zhongqi presided over the meeting. The attendees included Tao Qingfeng, Pan Mengqiao, Shi Tongren, Gu Hongru, Bao Siren, Jin Jushan (represented by Pan Mengqiao), Wu Shiqiao (represented by Xu Jizhong), Yuan Xiluo (represented by Bing Yi), Yin Shuqi, and Peng Weizong. The agenda included: (1) The proposal to expand the organization and intensify the work of the committee was approved in principle. Shi Wenran, Yu Yun, and Tao Yunming were appointed to revise the regulations, which will be submitted to the Standing Committee for approval and then submitted to the county government for discussion at the county administrative meeting. (2) The proposal for opinions on post-disaster measures for embankment construction was approved. Tao Yunming was requested to provide detailed explanations of all phase designs and send them to the relevant authorities for consideration and implementation. (3) The current provincial allocation of 60,000 yuan for the seawall emergency repair project is only sufficient to fill collapsed gaps with mud-filled sacks. After one month, there will be no strong winds or waves, and this money will be wasted. The minimum requirement for emergency relief is to use temporary measures, but the cost would be no less than several million yuan. The provincial allocation is insufficient to meet this challenge. A request will be made to the central government for a special allocation to facilitate the commencement of formal construction. (4) How to request funds from the province and the central government for seawall protection was discussed together with the above. It was resolved to send telegrams to the Executive Yuan and the Ministries of Finance and Interior, and to have representatives of various organizations and Zhang Gongquan meet with Minister Song in person to expedite the allocation of funds. Detailed plans for permanent solutions will be telegraphed later. (5) The proposal to contact relevant counties along the seawall to discuss seawall protection measures was approved. Yuan Shushu, Bao Tigan, Feng Maiying, Shi Wenran, and Ling Zhibin were appointed to make separate contacts.</p>
<h3>Telegram to Nanjing Requesting Funds</h3>
<p>The Baoshan Seawall Protection Committee sent telegrams to the Executive Yuan and the Ministries of Finance and Interior yesterday, stating: "To President Wang of the Nanjing Executive Yuan, Finance Minister Song, and Interior Minister Huang: The Baoshan County seawall, which is over 5,800 zhang long, has not received provincial budget funds for embankment construction for the past eight or nine years. Last year, the Jiangnan Embankment Post-Disaster Committee raised funds to repair the seawall, costing over 270,000 yuan. During the winter, the seawall was damaged, with over 2,700 zhang destroyed and five or six breaches. The previous project was completed less than a year ago, and all the efforts have been wasted. After repeated appeals from officials and citizens, there is only the hope of 60,000 yuan from the province, which is a drop in the bucket. Even for emergency repair plans, only mud-filled sacks can be used to block the gaps. Compared to the two layers of timber and two layers of stone used last year, after experiencing wind and rain, the funds will be wasted. The 60,000 yuan emergency repair project will inevitably collapse under the current autumn tides. For the present, permanent solutions are out of the question. Even for temporary measures, to ensure that residents can sleep soundly, no less than several million yuan are needed. Otherwise, coastal hurricanes and storms will occur every year. Not only will Baoshan, a weak and small county, inevitably sink, but Shanghai, the national economic center, and the wealthy areas of the former Suzhou, Songjiang, and Taicang prefectures will also be transformed into a swamp. We can only earnestly request the central government to take charge and resolve the situation and quickly allocate large sums of money for relief. We await urgent instructions. Detailed plans for permanent solutions will be gathered from experts and submitted later. Respectfully, the Baoshan Seawall Protection Committee. (11th)"</p>
<h3>The Overseas Chinese Relief Association in Mexico Cables a Request for Central Government Relief</h3>
<p>=Allocate 5 Million from the American Cotton and Wheat Loan=</p>
<p>=The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission Should Establish Farms and Factories=</p>
<p>=To Accommodate Distressed Overseas Chinese and Increase Production=</p>
<p>The Overseas Chinese Relief Association in Mexico of this city believes that after Mexico implemented anti-Chinese measures, the money accumulated by the hard work of overseas Chinese in Mexico and the businesses painstakingly managed for decades were all looted by the anti-Chinese party. The overseas Chinese have suddenly lost their jobs, and their livelihoods are precarious. In addition to the more than 4,000 people who were expelled from the country and returned home, there are still tens of thousands of compatriots stranded in Mexico. Efforts should be made to seek fundamental relief. Yesterday, the association specifically cabled the Central Political Conference, requesting that 5 million yuan be allocated from the American cotton and wheat loan to be entrusted to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission to establish farms or factories to accommodate distressed overseas Chinese and increase production. The original cable is recorded below.</p>
<h3>Cable to the Central Political Conference</h3>
<p>To the Central Political Conference in Nanjing: The current Mexican anti-Chinese party has no regard for international laws or morality. They have openly implemented the abandonment of our 40,000 overseas Chinese in Mexico, arbitrarily imprisoning, violently beating, and even forcibly expelling them. As a result, the money accumulated by the hard work of a lifetime and the businesses painstakingly managed for decades have been looted and confiscated by these people. The misery is indescribable. Our overseas Chinese entrust their lives to foreign countries, barehanded and unable to resist. They can only be subjected to oppression. At present, it is estimated that over 4,000 people have been forcibly expelled from the country, and there are still tens of thousands stranded in Mexico with no way to escape. Urgent fundamental measures should be taken to provide relief and comfort to the distressed overseas Chinese. The government has an absolute responsibility to protect and support overseas Chinese. Therefore, we respectfully cable and implore you to allocate 55 million yuan from the proceeds of the wheat and cotton loans to establish farms or factories for the purpose of providing relief to distressed overseas Chinese in Mexico, to be entrusted to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission for handling. This measure is also a legitimate expenditure for construction and production. It is unlike the painful, charitable maintenance referred to in the Lushan Conference. We are grateful and still hope for instructions to comfort the people. Huang Zhulin, Chairman of the Shanghai Overseas Chinese Relief Association in Mexico, and all distressed overseas Chinese respectfully kowtow. (Seal)</p>
<h3>Cable to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission</h3>
<p>To the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission in Nanjing: The cotton and wheat loan has been established, and the Lushan Conference has decided to use the funds for construction and production, which will greatly benefit the national economy and the people's livelihood. We are pleased and hope that the government will consider the 40,000 distressed overseas Chinese in Mexico who have been discriminated against and bullied by foreigners and are stranded abroad or have lost their jobs and returned home. We earnestly request that 5 million yuan be allocated from the proceeds of the cotton and wheat loan to be entrusted to your commission to establish large-scale farms or factories to accommodate the distressed overseas Chinese who have lost their jobs due to the anti-Chinese measures in Mexico, to maintain their livelihoods and stabilize their morale. We have always admired your commission as the highest leading agency for managing overseas Chinese affairs. We are confident that you will sympathize with this matter of relieving distressed overseas Chinese. In addition to cabling, we specifically cable and earnestly request that your commission propose to the Central Political Conference to achieve the goal of allocating funds for maintenance, to comfort the distressed overseas Chinese and to stabilize public opinion. We await instructions with utmost respect and distress. Huang Zhulin, Chairman of the Shanghai Overseas Chinese Relief Association in Mexico, and all distressed overseas Chinese respectfully kowtow.

<h3>Officials, Gentry, and Merchants in Chuansha Discuss Relief for Hurricane Victims in Sansha</h3>
<p>Planning to Form 30 Teams</p>
<p>Each Team with 1,500 Yuan</p>
<p>The recent hurricane in Gaodun Sandbar, Hengsha Sandbar, and Yuanyuan Sandbar in Chuansha caused a major disaster, turning homes into ruins, displacing the old and young, and causing people and livestock to be swept away, with death and devastation everywhere. Upon receiving the report, County Magistrate Li Leng immediately visited the area with Mr. Lu Wenmei to conduct an on-site inspection. The situation was truly tragic, and urgent relief was needed. Therefore, the Chuansha County Gaodun Sandbar, Hengsha Sandbar, Yuanyuan Sandbar Three Sandbar Flood Relief Committee was established. At 7:00 PM yesterday, the committee held a meeting at Daguanlou on Sima Road, inviting people from Chuansha and other cities and counties in Pudong who were residing in Shanghai to discuss relief methods. No fewer than 50-60 people attended, including Huang Renzhi, Lu Wenmei, Zhang Bochou, Ling Yunzhou, Zhao Zengtao, Qin Yanqi, Ding Jiaying, Gu Bowei, Song Shuxiao, and Tao Rangqing. After County Magistrate Li reported on the disaster situation, relief methods were discussed and it was decided to form 30 teams, each with a minimum of 1,500 yuan. In addition to those who pledged support on the spot, appropriate individuals were nominated to take on responsibilities. The Shanghai Charity Association and Mr. Lu Bohong also provided assistance. The Pudong Township Association had previously held a meeting and planned to assist the two counties of Nan and Chuan. The aforementioned relief funds will be collected for one month and sent to the Pudong Bank for safekeeping to ensure prudence. County Magistrate Li repeatedly stated that, in any case, the relief funds must be used effectively and not wasted.</p>
<h3>China International Famine Relief Commission Meeting Today</h3>

Therefore, it has been decided to convene a board meeting at No. 12 Renji Road this afternoon to discuss relief measures.</p>
<h3>Minhang Chamber of Commerce Telegraphs Request to Abolish Cotton Business Tax</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Zhang Jingling, acting chairman of the Shanghai County Minhang Chamber of Commerce, telegraphed the Ministry and Provincial authorities, respectfully informing the Nanjing Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Industry, and Jiangsu Provincial Government: The Jiangsu Province is reorganizing the cotton business tax, stipulating a tax rate of ten per thousand, and allowing the Business Tax Bureau to conduct essential inspections, which is similar to a disguised likin (internal transit tax) and borders on disturbing commerce. The meaning of business lies in the necessary conditions of offering goods and selling them. Merchants in Location A invest in purchasing cotton, and must first pay tax to transport it. When it is sold in Location B, they must again pay tax to ship it out. Thus, merchants pay tax when transporting and tax when selling. Tax is levied on both entry and exit, resembling a redundant and burdensome system, more severe than the old likin. Furthermore, most cotton is purchased by factories, and the factories' business tax has already been reported and paid in accordance with regulations. Now, imposing another tax on their purchase of cotton feels particularly harsh and burdensome. In recent years, the rural economy has collapsed and commerce has declined. The main reason for this is the influx of foreign cotton and the stagnation of domestic cotton sales. Both the government and the people are seeking solutions. The decline of agriculture and forestry affects the foundation of the nation, and cotton is crucial to the textile industry, not only affecting the livelihoods of farmers but also the clothing and food of the poor. Therefore, to revitalize the rural economy, the first priority is to protect domestic cotton. How can one bear to impose double heavy taxes? It is reasonable to telegraph and earnestly request an immediate order for abolition, to alleviate the difficulties of Jiangsu merchants and safeguard the people's livelihood. The urgency to await orders is extreme. Respectfully, Zhang Jingling, Acting Chairman of the Shanghai County Minhang Chamber of Commerce, kowtows. True Print.</p>
<h3>Lake Society Requests Reduction of Land Surveying Fees</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Government has ordered the Civil Affairs and Finance Departments to investigate and handle.</p>
<h3>Petition</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Lake Society submits a document to the Zhejiang Provincial Government stating: Presenting this report based on the situation, humbly requesting that you order the Civil Affairs and Finance Departments to consider reducing land surveying fees to alleviate the people's difficulties. The executive committee member Yu Zhongxian proposed that the collection of land surveying fees in Zhejiang Province at a rate of five jiao per mu is too burdensome, and it should be reviewed and submitted for consideration to reduce it, in order to alleviate the people's difficulties and comply with their wishes. This has been received by the Society. Investigating and surveying land is the most important task during the period of political tutelage. The government has a complete plan for implementing weights and measures, and we dare not disagree with the overall plan. However, considering that the people of Zhejiang Province have suffered from frequent floods in recent years and lack savings, let alone the fact that Western Zhejiang, though once rich, has seen its silk, tea, and bamboo shoots decline due to foreign competition, leading to difficulties for both farmers and merchants, causing sighs and lamentations. Furthermore, the surtaxes under the various county land tax items are nearly equal to the principal amount, coupled with house donations, miscellaneous taxes, and fundraising, leaving no peaceful days. One reason is the decision of the provincial budget, which makes it difficult to reduce taxes rashly. Another reason is the increasing foreign aggression, making it even more difficult to sit by and watch things fall apart. The people of both provinces are struggling under the burden and are already unable to cope. However, observing the situation, although they may not be reduced to cannibalism, their appearance is pale and haggard, their brows furrowed, the sound of looms unheard, and the fields contain starving people. Now, suddenly imposing land surveying fees is no less than adding to the people's suffering. The cunning ones will take the opportunity to increase rents and oppress the honest and weak. How can those who rely on perpetual tenancy be able to stop farming in the morning and switch to other occupations in the evening? They will inevitably end up in ditches and gullies. Therefore, the collection of this fee is objectively taken from the landowners, but indirectly collected from the toiling people. Considering the above points, the proposal made by Committee Member Yu is indeed based on unavoidable circumstances. After discussion at the first regular meeting of the Society's Standing Committee, it was decided to petition your government to consider reducing land surveying fees to alleviate the people's difficulties. This has been recorded. May we humbly request your consideration and order the Civil Affairs and Finance Departments to make a reduction to alleviate the people's difficulties? We hereby submit this document for your review and implementation. Respectfully submitted to Chairman Lu of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, by Chen Qicai, Chairman of the Lake Society Committee.</p>
<h3>Reply Telegram</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Government replies in a telegram stating: To Mr. Chen Aishi of the Shanghai Lake Society Committee: Your letter has been received. Regarding whether land surveying fees can be reduced, we have ordered the Civil Affairs and Finance Departments to jointly investigate and handle the matter. This is a special reply. Lu Dipin, Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government. Secret two seals.</p>
<h3>Closing of the Office of the Chief Captain of the Aviation Association Recruitment Team</h3>
<p>Since the end of February this year, the Chinese Aviation Association appointed Mayor Wu as the Chief Captain of the Shanghai Recruitment Team and hired Wang Xiaolai and 273 others as captains of the recruitment teams.</p>
<p>In early March, they began recruiting members, collecting donations, and organizing the recruitment team office to handle various fundraising matters. However, regarding the recruitment of members by each team, the original deadline was the end of April. Because the recruitment results at that time were less than half of the originally planned two million yuan, to increase the recruitment results, the deadline was extended by one month, and the actual closing was carried out at the end of May. The total results obtained were 1,394,870 yuan, 9 jiao, 1 fen, and 1 li. This number represents the donations pledged by the captains in each report. The actual cash received, as of now, is only 745,098 yuan, 9 jiao, and 7 fen, 5 li, plus US$22,227. The office must urge each team to pay donations and submit various receipts, and continue to pursue special donations from individuals and organizations, which has delayed the closing. Now, the promised donations from each team have been collected successively. There are still a few outstanding, and most of the receipts have also been submitted. The office, in terms of procedures and responsibilities, must publish the recruitment results of each team in detail in the newspapers, including the number of ordinary members, special members, supporting members, and permanent organizational members, and the amount of donations. In addition, a "General Report of Results" must be compiled and published to the citizens of the city. In addition to reading the recruitment efforts of each team in the daily news, there is also a special book available for reference. Enthusiasm for saving the country through aviation should be even more intense, and donations should continue to flow in.</p>
<h3>Italian Silk Industry Expert Iolival Departed for Home This Morning</h3>
<p>The silk industry held a farewell banquet last night.</p>
<p>The Dagong News Agency reports that Italian Congressman Iolival returned to Shanghai yesterday morning from Hangzhou. Zhu Jingan of the Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Anhui Silk Cocoon General Association, Shen Huachen of the Shanghai Silk Factory Association, and He Shangping of the China United Constitutional Sericulture Improvement Field, arranged a banquet at the Xinya Restaurant on Nanjing Road last night to foster goodwill.

<h3>Third Day of the Accountants' Association Meeting</h3>
<p>The Accountants' Association of the Republic of China convened a meeting at 11 a.m. yesterday at the Dengtuomo Hotel on Beijing Road to review the proposals. Representatives from various public associations attended, including Xie Lin, Lang Junwei, Tang Zaizhang, Huang Renqiang, Yu Huairen, Chen Qixiang, Jiang Wanping, Zhai Sunhuan, Bei Zuyi, Wang Sifang, Wen Yiyou, Lu Fushang, Wang Haifan, Qin Kai, He Yuanming, Cheng Xianzhi, Zhang Jiadong, Chen Riping, Zhao Zuwei, Li Ziying, Xi Yushu, and more than twenty others. They divided the dozens of proposals from various public associations into groups for review, and decided to submit them to the general assembly today for decision and implementation. At 3 p.m., the representatives visited the clearing house, where they were received by Manager Zhu of the clearing house. At 4 p.m., the Municipal Chamber of Commerce hosted them, with Chairman Wang Xiaolai, Supervisors Du Yuesheng, Chen Songyuan, Zhu Wenqi, Lu Fengzhu, Luo Qinghua, and other committee members, as well as Secretary-General Zheng Chengqing, providing warm hospitality. During the banquet, Wang Xiaolai stood up to give a speech, saying that accounting academics and industrial and commercial enterprises have a close relationship and must be mutually supportive in order for industry to prosper and accounting to advance, achieving a mutually beneficial effect. Then, the representatives publicly elected Representative Xi Yushu to thank the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for its hospitality. He gave a speech, stating that accountants are a new and emerging profession that coexists and prospers with industry and commerce, developing at the same time. Shanghai is the center of industry and commerce, but if the accounting organization within the industry is not complete and detailed, it will be unstable. As Chairman Wang just said, large companies and factories often fail due to poor accounting organization. It should be known that accountants are like doctors in terms of accounting matters. It is a proactive guarantee work, such as planning systems and annual audits, which prevent problems before they occur. Other matters such as liquidation are like treating a patient who is already critically ill. The effectiveness of the outcome is naturally conceivable. Therefore, it is hoped that your association can promote that all industries invite a suitable accounting consultant to serve them, so as to implement Chairman Wang's hope that industry and commerce and accountants will be mutually supportive and cooperate sincerely. This is not only fortunate for industry and commerce, but also the light of the future for accountants. After the speech, the meeting adjourned.</p>

<p>After Ma and Huang, Lei Dafu Assassinated Again</p>
<h3>Lei Currently a Secret Investigator for the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Very Active</h3>
<p>Yesterday, he was ambushed by enemies, and died instantly from fatal wounds.</p>
<p>丨Three Assassins Fled, a Stray Bullet Wounded a Boy丨</p>
<p>Since Ma Shaowu (aka Lu Keqin), Director of the Special Affairs Section of the Supervisory Office of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, was tragically assassinated, and less than ten days later, Huang Yonghua (aka Qian Yizhang), who worked with Ma, was murdered for the second time, unexpectedly, within a month, another incident occurred yesterday morning. Lei Dafu (aka Jiang Chen), a secret investigator (commonly known as an informant) of the Investigation Unit of the Special Affairs Section of the Supervisory Office, was shot and killed by three thugs at the intersection of Zhonghua Road and Yingxun Road, outside the Xiaoximen (Small West Gate). These three were outstanding talents in handling special affairs cases for the Municipal Public Security Bureau. Now they have been killed one after another. It is not only unfortunate for the three, but also unfortunate for the Municipal Public Security Bureau. The following is an account of the circumstances of Lei Dafu's shooting yesterday.</p>
<p>[Image: Lei Dafu died after being shot (photographed by Xu Tianzhang)]</p>
<h3>Young Man Gasping Like a Cow, Situation Urgent</h3>
<p>At around 8:50 a.m. yesterday, Zhu Huanwen, a police officer at post number 22 of the second precinct, second division of the Nanshi Public Security Bureau, was on duty at the intersection of Zhonghua Road and Yingxun Road outside Xiaoximen. Suddenly, a large man wearing a white silk shirt approached the officer and claimed to be a supervisor from the Municipal Public Security Bureau. He said that according to a confidential report, there was a secret meeting of communists in the nearby Jiangyin Street and requested the officer to go with him to arrest them. Upon hearing this, the officer thought the matter was important and planned to report to the station first. Unexpectedly, while he was hesitating, he suddenly saw a young man in a Western suit running towards him, gasping like a cow. Seeing this, Officer Zhu was about to order the young man to stop when three gunshots rang out at the same time.</p>
<h3>Three Assassins Fled, Young Man Died</h3>
<p>As the gunshots rang out, the young man in the Western suit fell to the ground in response. The three assassins, dressed in white shirts and pants, were about forty or fifty yards away. They turned around and fled. Officer Zhu immediately drew his gun and chased after them, firing as he went. In the confusion, none of the shots hit. In an instant, the assassins had disappeared. The large man who claimed to be a supervisor also fled without a trace. Officer Zhu immediately used the telephone to report to the station. Upon hearing the news, Director Tang immediately led a large number of police officers to surround and search the area. He examined the young man in the Western suit and found him lying on the ground at the entrance of number 16 Yingxun Road, with one bullet each in the back of his head, right temple, and left side. He had already died.</p>
<h3>Secret Investigator Lei Dafu Confirmed Without Error</h3>
<p>The young man was about twenty years old, with a thin face and a long head, and his hair was combed in Western style. He was wearing a blue French suit, a white silk inner shirt with a turned-down collar, gray flannel pants, gray woolen socks, and black leather shoes. He was still tightly holding a police whistle in his left hand, presumably prepared to sound the alarm in case of an accident. Upon further inspection, a registration paper from the Buminguang Eye Hospital was found on his person, with the name Lei Dafu, age 27, written on it. In addition, there were eight silver dollars, six jiao in small coins, a small diary, and a laundry ticket from the Liyun Laundry Company. Nothing else was found. Director Tang quickly reported to the Supervisory Office, and it was then learned that he was indeed Lei Dafu, a secret investigator from the office.</p>
<h3>Stray Bullet Wounds Young Boy, Life in Danger</h3>
<p>When the thugs fired their guns, a stray bullet struck Lin Gen, an eleven-year-old child of Fu Jialin, a carpenter from Suzhou who lived upstairs in Jin Shuxing's carpentry shop at number 10 on the same road. The bullet hit the child's left side, and the injury was serious. It is feared that his life is in danger. He has been sent to the hospital for treatment. After the incident, reporters made inquiries in all directions. As a result, it was said that since the cases of Ma and Huang, the authorities had been investigating very strictly, and the deceased Lei Dafu had been particularly active. Yesterday, Lei secretly discovered that the main criminals who assassinated Ma and Huang were to meet somewhere in Jiangyin Street. Therefore, he agreed with a supervisor to go and arrest them in order to establish merit. Unexpectedly, when Lei walked to Jiangyin Street, he had already been recognized by someone. He was followed to Yingxun Road and shot to death.</p>
<h3>Opening of the Yellow River Flood Relief Entertainment Fair</h3>
<p>Chaired by Chu Minyi, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan</p>
<p>The Shanghai Yellow River Flood Relief Entertainment Fair, organized by Shanghai celebrity Huang Jinrong, held its opening ceremony yesterday noon at the Great World. Chu Minyi, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, and others attended. Chu gave a report on the general situation of the flood. The details are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Attendees</h3>
<p>The attendees at the opening ceremony included Chu Minyi, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, Zhang Dingcheng, Councilor of the Military Affairs Commission, Wu Tiecheng, Mayor of Shanghai (represented by Li Dachao), Wu Xingya, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau (represented by Chen Lengseng), Huang Jinrong (represented by Wang Wenkui), Qian Jinping, Huang Bodu (represented by Sa Fangchen), Huang Hanzhi (represented by Lu Deshen), Zhuang Jingfu, Wu Kaisheng, Shao Rufeng, and over thirty others. Chu Minyi, Li Dachao, Chen Lengseng, Wu Kaisheng, and Zhang Dingcheng were publicly elected as the presidium.</p>
<p>[Image: Archway at the Entrance of the Great World (photographed by Xu Tianzhang)]</p>
<h3>Report from the Organizing Committee</h3>
<p>After the opening ceremony, Shao Rujing, a member of the organizing committee, first reported on the preparation process, saying that Mr. Xu Shiying came to Shanghai from Lushan because of the Yellow River flood to discuss fundraising, but there was no concrete plan. Now, thanks to Mr. Huang Jinrong's generosity, he specially invited famous artists in Shanghai to perform at the Great World, willing to donate all the income from the 11th, 12th, and 13th to the Yellow River flood relief. All expenses are borne by Mr. Huang. We are even more grateful to Secretary-General Chu for personally coming to give a speech.</p>
<h3>Report from the Chairman</h3>
<p>Next, Chairman Chu Minyi reported that in recent years, China has suffered from oppression by strong neighbors and internal disasters such as floods and bandits. The Yangtze River flood was very serious the year before last, and charitable organizations raised funds for relief. Now, the Yellow River is causing disaster, and thousands of miles of dikes have broken. This is a rare disaster unprecedented in centuries. The government has specially convened seven relevant provinces, and the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission and the Economic Commission have formed a joint relief effort. Charitable organizations are also trying to raise funds. Mr. Huang's generosity in making this righteous act to help the government's inadequacy will make all the people know the severity of the Yellow River flood and allow the victims to avoid starvation. We hope that all sectors will vigorously advocate and promote, and not fail the true meaning of this meeting.</p>
<p>[Image: Photograph of the Opening Ceremony of the Yellow River Flood Relief Entertainment Fair (photographed by Xu Tianzhang)]</p>
<h3>Speech and Notes</h3>
<p>Next, Li Dachao reported, "Today, I am here on behalf of the mayor to attend this grand event. After listening to Secretary-General Chu's report, I know that if we do not find a way to solve foreign aggression, internal strife, floods, etc., the disaster will be even more severe in the future. I hope everyone will quickly find a way to rescue. At the same time, everyone should take responsibility, be as generous as Mr. Huang, and hope to get the utmost effect within three days." Chen Lengseng said, "After hearing the speeches of Secretary-General Chu and Section Chief Li, in this time of serious national crisis, we should take responsibility to help the country. The great flood of the Republic of China in the 20th year, and the foreign aggression of September 18th and January 28th in the 21st year, have caused a lot of pain to the country. Unexpectedly, this year we are suffering from the Yellow River disaster again. The country's finances and relief efforts are powerless. We have to hope that the national people will rise up to help the government, do their best to publicize and donate, and get through this difficult time."</p>
<h3>Increase Entertainment</h3>
<p>In addition to the original dramas in each class, the Great World has also invited famous dramatists to perform voluntarily. Tickets are sold for two jiao. Three dance performances in the Da Jing class's new theater originally sold admission tickets for two jiao each, now changed to four jiao. The other venues do not increase the price. There is no additional fundraising in the venues. The income from the ticket sales will all be used for relief funds.</p>
<h3>Jingbei Garrison Command Moves to Arrest Feng Laosi</h3>
<p>Allowed to Move and Escort After Evidence is Presented</p>
<p>Feng Laosi, a Muslim from Shandong Province, also known as Feng Renshou and Feng Renfu, has been running the Xieji Barber Shop on Edward Road, the Zhonghua Bathhouse in Beigaoshou Lane, and the Fuju Transportation Company for years. His business has been developing well. Recently, someone distributed leaflets outside, stating that Feng was originally a bandit in his hometown. Later, because the government was arresting him tightly, he fled to Shanghai. He successively held public positions such as patrolman and road police, and was dismissed one after another. Then, he opened a door to accept apprentices and colluded with railway teahouses to privately sell red pills, morphine, and drugs. Recently, he specialized in transporting Japanese goods, and his behavior was the same as a traitor. The Huizhong Concession Police Department, based on the statements in the leaflets, sent detectives to arrest Feng Laosi and escort him to the First Special District Local Court, requesting detention for investigation. Feng then hired Lawyer Fan Gang to apply for permission to post bail and be released for interrogation. The case was disclosed in the newspapers. After the case was disclosed in the newspapers, the Songhu Garrison Command learned of it. Feng Laosi had committed a major crime in the past and had been at large for a long time. At first, they did not know where he was hiding, so they could not investigate and arrest him. Now that he has been arrested by the police, he should be transferred to the case for interrogation and punishment. Therefore, they sent staff to the court yesterday morning to apply for a transfer. The police then transferred Feng to the Eighth Criminal Court. After Judge Xue heard the case, the police lawyer Wang Yaotang stated the police investigation. He said that no direct evidence had been obtained. As for the Garrison Command's request for transfer, they should be asked to present considerable evidence. The representative of the Garrison Command stated that due to the rush of time, he could not bring the case. Judge Xue then instructed Feng Laosi to be detained temporarily and await the presentation of evidence by the Garrison Command before further processing.</p>
<h3>Bomb at Xu Ruiqing's House</h3>
<p>Xu Ruiqing, a native of Wuxi, lives at number 1084 Dongyouheng Road, and runs an iron factory for a living. His factory is also located on the same road. At around 7 p.m. last night, a thug suddenly threw a bomb from the road to his house. The bomb went through the glass window and entered, hitting the wall and then exploding. However, because the explosion was weak, fortunately no one was injured. After the incident, the police sent detectives to investigate the truth.</p>
<h3>Major Fire at Lujiadu, Pudong</h3>
<p>= Eight Thousand Jars of Shaoxing Wine Burned, Loss of Thirty Thousand Gold =</p>
<p>= Kangji Winery Not Insured Against Fire, Suffering a Great Loss =</p>
<p>A fire broke out at the Kangji Winery warehouse, number 14 Gaomuqiaobinnan Lane, Lujiadu, Pudong, at 7:15 p.m. last night. It burned for about two hours, destroying most of the thirty-six thatched houses and eighteen tile houses. The remaining few tile houses were also razed to the ground. The loss was more than thirty thousand gold. The details of the destruction are recorded below.</p>
<h3>History of the Winery</h3>
<p>The winery has been in operation for several years. Initially, the scale was very small. Later, due to the flourishing business year by year, the site was gradually rented and purchased to expand the warehouse. Currently, there are thirty-six thatched warehouses and eighteen tile warehouses, all of which are filled with Shaoxing wine that has been produced, reaching more than 10,000 jars. The construction form of the warehouse, the thatched houses are divided into three rows, twelve rooms each, located to the east of the tile houses, all facing south. The tile houses are built on the west side, connected to the north and south in a row, facing east. The south of the thatched houses still has vacant land, which is used to store empty jars.</p>
<h3>Fire Burns for Two Hours</h3>
<p>At 7:15 p.m. yesterday, a fire suddenly broke out in the middle row of thatched warehouses. Because the warehouse materials were made of bamboo and straw, it caught fire immediately. In an instant, it penetrated through the roof, and the flames shot straight into the sky, visible from several miles away. When the nearby police officers of the third precinct, second station reported to the station, Director Yang and Inspectors Sun and Tang led the police to the scene to suppress the fire. They negotiated with Director Sun of the nearby Yingchang Match Factory to open the factory's self-contained water tower and connect a 450-foot-long hose to the fire scene for watering. At the same time, the Dongchang Road Pudong District Fire Brigade also sent a pump car to fight the fire. However, the fire was fierce, and the east wind was very strong, making it difficult to extinguish it for a while. In less than half an hour, the thatched warehouses in the front and rear rows had been affected and destroyed, and the tile warehouses in the west, which were close to the thatched houses, also caught fire continuously. Most of it was burned, and the remaining few were knocked down by manpower to prevent it from spreading. The fire began to weaken at around 8 o'clock, but the firefighters were still afraid that the embers would reignite, so they continued to extinguish the fire. The Yingchang factory irrigated a total of seven or eight thousand gallons of water, but the fire brigade took water from the hamlets, which is difficult to calculate. They rescued until 9:30, and when the fire was completely extinguished, they stopped.</p>
<h3>Panic of the Neighbors</h3>
<p>After the fire broke out, the garbage pond area to the south of the winery was full of Jiangbei thatched sheds. Most of the Jiangbei residents were having dinner when they suddenly saw the fire. They were all extremely panicked. For a while, they supported the old and carried the young, and fled in droves. All the furniture was mostly moved to the open space near the Yingchang factory in the west. The crying and chaos were very disordered. People from all over who were watching the fire came in droves and were extremely crowded. Fortunately, the police officers of the third district, second station maintained their strength, and Zhang, the district head of the third district, also personally supervised the police to protect the area, so no accident occurred, and the fire never crossed the fence surrounding the winery, so the surrounding houses were not affected, which is a great fortune, otherwise it would be unimaginable.</p>
<h3>Loss of Thirty Thousand Gold</h3>
<p>In this battle, all the burned and demolished houses of the winery, a total of fifty-four tile and thatched houses, containing 10,000 jars of Shaoxing wine, about 8,000 jars were burned. The average cost per jar is about two yuan and seven jiao, and the loss of the jar price is five jiao per jar, totaling nearly 30,000 gold. The thatched houses of thirty-six rooms and the tile houses of eighteen rooms are worth about 5,000 gold. The total loss of 35,000 gold is a precedent in the winery’s opening. After this disaster, the creation is deeply affected, and it is difficult to recover the old view for a while.</p>
<h3>Reason Not Found</h3>
<p>After the fire was extinguished, Yang Zhongquan, director of the third precinct and second station, instructed the police to bring Wang Zuting, the relief room of the workshop, to the station to investigate the cause of the fire. According to Wang's confession, he is 38 years old, from Ningbo, and has been serving in the workshop for many years. No one usually lives in the warehouse, so the cause of the fire is still difficult to understand, but there is no fire insurance. After obtaining the confession, the director, because the cause of the fire was unknown, continued to send police officers to the neighbors of the fire scene, residents Shi Jihua from Haimen and Zhu Yushan from Shaoxing, numbers 45 and 46, to testify at the station, all saying that when the fire broke out, they were having dinner, and when they walked out of the door, they saw the flames had come out of the roof. The director had no clues as to what caused the fire, and will continue to summon the foremen and other witnesses of the workshop today for further research. He also ordered that the relief room be temporarily kept in the station and wait for the disposal, and prepared a document on the same night to report to the Intelligence Department of the Main Bureau for review.</p>
<h3>Record of the Interrogation of a Large Group of Fake Military Officers</h3>
<p>= Chief of Staff, Adjutant, and Head of Communications Department, All Present =</p>
<p>= Police File Charges on Three Counts, Postponing Interrogation for Two Weeks =</p>
<p>Yin Bohong, a Shandong native formerly in the military, had retired and was idle. He conspired with Dong Shujin, an Anhui native residing at 21 Kangti Road in the French Concession, and privately set up the headquarters of the Fifth Route Army of the Eastern Weak North Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army in Room 39 of the Huajie East Apartment at 54 Malang Road in the French Concession. Yin and Dong appointed themselves as commander and deputy commander, respectively, and colluded with five ruffians: Zhou Bingrong from Zhejiang, Cui Qujie from Yangzhou, Teng Ganchen from Anhui, Lü Hanwen from Hangzhou, and Wang Peide, assigning them positions such as chief of staff and adjutant. Additionally, Fang Zhen was appointed as the director of the Shanghai Communications Office, issuing appointment letters indiscriminately and defrauding people of money. Among those deceived were Gong Jizong, a local lacquerer residing at 785 Fahua Town in Western Shanghai, Yue Dingchen, an Anhui native who ran a military band business at 58 Huacheng Road, and Qian Rongfeng, all of whom were swindled into accepting appointments as adjutant and captain, paying sums ranging from 20 to 30 yuan. The scheme was discovered by Pu Xuli (transliteration), the head of the investigation section of the French Concession Police Political Department, on the morning of the 9th. At 9:30 AM, he led Chinese detectives Zhao Zibo, Xu Rufa, Wu Zhonghua, and Li Luochuan to search Room 39 of the Huadong Apartment, arresting Yin Bohong, Dong Shujin, Zhou Bingrong, Cui Jie, and Teng Ganchen on the spot. They confiscated appointment letters in the name of the Fifth Route Army of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army, a list of high-ranking officials, blank appointment letters, receipts for issued appointment letters, military certificates, badges, symbols, and correspondence instructions, training circulars, resumes, military uniforms, hats, armed belts, and other evidence. Furthermore, they located the deceived Gong Jizong and Yue Dingchen. They then proceeded to 22 Baoxing Lane, Caishi Street, where they apprehended adjutant Lü Hanwen and Wang Peide, the director of the adjutant office. They also went to Dong Shujin's residence at 21 Kangti Road and confiscated five wooden chops for appointment letters, letters, and documents. Fang Zhen was at large and had not been apprehended. The detectives brought all the arrested individuals to the police station. After interrogation by the head of the Political Department, Yin Bohong confessed that he was 43 years old, from Shandong, and served as the commander of the Fifth Route Army of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army, whose commander-in-chief was Zhu Fuhai, currently stationed at Xifengkou. Dong Shujin confessed that he was 54 years old, from Anhui, residing at 21 Kangti Road, and served as the deputy commander. Zhou Bingkang confessed that he was 39 years old, from Zhejiang, and served as an adjutant. Cui Jie confessed that he was 38 years old, from Yangzhou, and served as a staff officer. Teng Ganchen confessed that he was 38 years old, from Anhui, and served as a staff officer. Lü Hanwen confessed that he was 43 years old, from Hangzhou, and served as an adjutant. Wang Peide confessed that he was 44 years old, served as the director of the adjutant office, and resided at 550 Beile Road. Gong Jizong confessed that he was 31 years old and a lacquerer. On the 4th of this month, Fang Zhen, claiming to be the director of the Shanghai Communications Office of the Fifth Route Army of the Northeast Volunteer Army, told me that the army was establishing an organization and asked me to contribute money. He then appointed me as an adjutant, sending the badge, symbol, and appointment letter to my home, and swindling me out of 20 yuan. Today, I went to the Huadong Apartment to ask Fang for money, but he had already gone to Nanjing to set up an office. I was arrested when I left. Yue Dingchen confessed that he was [] years old, from Anhui, and ran a military band business. They appointed me as a captain and asked me to buy musical instruments, and I was arrested while negotiating. The chief, based on the confessions, determined that Gong and Yue were not involved and ordered them to be released. Yin and the others were detained for further investigation. It was then discovered that Teng Ganchen, one of the defendants, had been sentenced to six months in prison last year for a political case handled by the Chinese authorities in the Chinese Concession. Not long after his release, he committed another crime. Yesterday, the defendants were escorted to the Second Special District Local Court. At 3 PM, Judge Xiong Huiping took the bench in the First Criminal Court and conducted a preliminary hearing. The police lawyer, Gu Shouxi, presented the case, prosecuting them on three counts under the criminal law: disturbing public order, forging documents and seals, and obtaining property by fraud. He stated that the police still needed to conduct a detailed investigation to apprehend the accomplices, requesting a postponement of the hearing for two weeks. The court reviewed the report, briefly questioned the defendants, and adjourned the hearing to the 15th for further investigation. The defendants were returned to custody pending further instructions.</p>
<h3>A Police Officer Seeks Revenge</h3>
<p>= Cheng Fuyan Shoots Zhou Zhenting =</p>
<p>= Dispute Arises from Search for Red Pills =</p>
<p>Cheng Fuyan, in his twenties and from Beiping, was a police officer at the Qingyun Road Substation of the Fifth District Police Department. Zhou Zhenting, thirty-four years old, from Shandong, was a police officer at the Fifth District Headquarters. Recently, the Fifth District Headquarters received a report that Cheng was running a red pill den inside Zhou Tongxing's carpentry shop in Hongfu Lane, Qingyun Road. Upon receiving the report, the headquarters immediately dispatched police officers to search the shop, but they returned empty-handed. Cheng believed that someone had interfered, claiming that it was Zhou Zhenting who had done so, and harbored intense resentment. Last night at 9 PM, after the guard shift at the substation had ended, Cheng secretly stole a four-inch live-ammunition handgun from the substation's patrol leader. He went to Zhou's post at the intersection of Xibaoxing Road and Qingyun Road to argue with him. After a brief dispute, Cheng pulled out the handgun from his sleeve and fired one shot at Zhou, hitting him in the neck. Zhou immediately collapsed. Nearby patrol officers, having heard the gunshot, rushed to the scene and restrained the assailant, escorting him to headquarters. The injured officer was immediately sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment. It was reported that the bullet was still lodged in his head and would be surgically removed after examination today. The offending police officer is currently detained in the Fifth District, pending investigation and handling.</p>
<h3>Zhang Qu'an and His Mother Reconcile as Before</h3>
<p>Zhang Qu'an, the son of the late wealthy Nanzun merchant Zhang Shiming, previously initiated litigation by refusing to acknowledge his biological mother, Zhou Miaoying. In the initial two trials, Qu'an was victorious. However, in the third trial, the Supreme Court overturned all previous judgments, stating that a son cannot sever ties with his mother. Zhou Miaoying, having achieved ultimate victory and obtaining legal recognition, initiated a criminal lawsuit against Zhang Xu, the senior wife, accusing her of instigating Qu'an to abandon her. Judge Liu Yugui of the First Special District Local Court held two hearings, summoning Qu'an to testify. However, Qu'an stated that the previous litigation was entirely his own doing and that he deeply regretted it, expressing his willingness to seek mediation through relatives and friends. Consequently, the case was postponed. It has been learned that Zhou and her son recently met at a large hotel in Western Shanghai. Qu'an agreed to fully repay all debts incurred by his biological mother, Zhou Miaoying, over the years, totaling 50,000 yuan. Additionally, he would provide a monthly allowance of 400 yuan for her expenses, rent a house for her to live in, and visit her frequently. From then on, mother and son reconciled as before. Zhou Miaoying instructed her representing lawyer, Yuan Yang'an, to file a motion to withdraw the lawsuit.</p>
<h3>Unnamed Man Jumps into the River</h3>
<p>Unknown Grievances Lead to this Final Path</p>
<p>The Riqing Company's small steamboat, Anshan No. 9, was sailing back to the Pudong pier from the Guangdong Road wharf at 6 PM the night before. As it was sailing past the French warship moored outside the French Concession, a young man suddenly jumped into the raging waves from the stern without anyone noticing. When the sailors discovered this and reported it, the captain stopped the boat and turned back to rescue him, but the man's body had already sunk and disappeared. The captain, Wang Liansheng, then sailed the boat to the Maritime Customs Water Police Station to report the incident. It was heard that the deceased was wearing a white undershirt and white shorts, and was about twenty years old. It is unknown what hidden grievances drove him to take this final path. His name and age are currently difficult to determine.</p>
<h3>Worker Crushed to Death by Car</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at approximately 12:40 PM, a public bus on Jiading Road in the Hongkou district was passing by when a man dressed in a white cloth shirt and trousers, about twenty-two or twenty-three years old and resembling a worker, was riding a bicycle towards the bus. He was unable to avoid it in time and was knocked to the ground by the bus, suffering a severe head injury that resulted in immediate death. Patrol officer No. 3193 from the Jiading Road Police Station investigated the incident and detained the driver responsible for the accident at the police station. The body was transported to Tongren Hospital and then transferred to the morgue for examination.</p>

<h3>Extension of Tap Water Pipes in Jiangwan</h3>
<p>Public Works and Health Bureaus Draft Plans</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Public Works Bureau has repeatedly received petitions from various organizations in Jiangwan requesting that the Zhabei Power Plant extend the town's tap water pipes. However, the company requires a subsidy of 4,000 yuan, which has caused the project to be delayed for a long time. As the Health Committee is about to be established, the water pipe issue urgently needs to be addressed. The Public Works Bureau and Health Bureau convened a meeting with all relevant parties to discuss solutions. Those who attended included Wu Mengqin and Gu Shanzhang from the Jiangwan District Municipal Committee, local gentry Cai Xiangsun and Li Shoupeng from Jiangwan, and Weng Yousan from the Water and Electricity Company. After discussion, the company stated that a subsidy of 4,000 yuan was still required. However, the Jiangwan area has suffered from commercial depression and economic hardship since the war, making fundraising extremely difficult. They strongly requested a reduction in the subsidy. Subsequently, the Public Works Bureau and Health Bureau proposed a compromise solution: the bureaus would request the Municipal Government to allocate 1,000 yuan as a subsidy, and the remaining amount would be raised locally within three months. If this proves impossible, the Municipal Government's subsidy would be used to prepare water transport vehicles and hire workers for transportation so that citizens in the area can purchase water.</p>

<h3>Kidnappers Request Withdrawal of Appeal</h3>
<p>Fearing Possible Failure Leading to a Death Sentence</p>
<p>Wang Yuanwei, a Shaoxing native and kidnapper, colluded with accomplices to kidnap Wang Gaosun's nine-year-old beloved son, Wang Delin, from 2 Dafeng Lane, Huanlong Road, French Concession, on December 28th of last year. The case was cracked by the British Concession Police. Wang was also involved in a kidnapping case in the British Concession and was sent to the First Special Court, where he was sentenced to life imprisonment. Subsequently, the police transferred him to the Second Special Court, where he was found guilty and sentenced to 21 years in prison. Wang refused to accept the verdict and filed an appeal with the Third Branch of the High Court. The High Court, based on the report, held an investigation hearing at 2 PM yesterday, with Judge Fan Peien presiding. Wang and accomplices Sun Xiaomao and Yao Sheng, who had already been convicted and were being executed, were brought in, along with witnesses including Wang Chen, the victim's mother, the young victim Wang Delin, and the detectives from the police station who handled the case. During the hearing, Wang suddenly stated in court that he was withdrawing the appeal and requested that the sentences imposed in the British Concession be combined and served in the French Concession prison. The court approved the withdrawal of the appeal and ordered a ruling on the consolidated execution. After the hearing, reporters asked Wang why he had suddenly withdrawn the appeal. He replied that he knew that his crime was real and that he was lucky to be sentenced to prison. If the appeal failed and he was sentenced to death, it would be even more unjust. Therefore, he was willing to withdraw the appeal and serve his sentence peacefully in prison, hoping to be pardoned when a general amnesty occurred. After he finished speaking, he was taken back to the detention center by the police to await the ruling.</p>

This is because the company had been preparing for this price reduction for a long time, and the special-priced items in each department are all unique. Moreover, the low prices are unprecedented. In the silk and satin department, new autumn 1933 styles of clothing materials are being offered with a "buy one foot, get one foot free" deal. In the fabric department, the latest "Butterfly" woolen cloth is also being offered with a "buy one, get one free" deal. Men's and women's leather shoes in the shoe and hat department are all 20% off. The commodity department, local products department, confectionery department, etc., all have special-priced items that cannot be fully described in words. Starting today, the food and beverage department will add Yangzhou dim sum, with no fewer than a hundred kinds of paper snacks and noodles, all at incredibly low prices. Economical set meals are priced at 35 cents per person, with complimentary tea and no small charges. All sectors of society should try it.</p>
<p>Yantai Beer Sells Well: Since the Yicheng Company on Tongfu Road in this city began distributing Yantai Beer, business has been very prosperous. This is because Yantai Beer is made with the purest spring water and refined through strict testing by Chinese and foreign medical doctors and chemists, proving that it is indeed the best quality beer with a mellow taste and excellent quality, quite suitable for health. This year, the hot weather has lasted longer, so the sales volume of Yantai Beer in this city has increased by more than 20,000 boxes compared to previous years. Because Yantai Beer has been sold at home and abroad for 20 years, it is a purely domestic product and cannot be compared with other imitations, so it has long been popular among all sectors of society.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Honorable Editor: I recently read a flyer published in the Shen Bao on September 10th, stating that Feng Laosi was a traitor and had been arrested by the police, involving the Fuji Transportation Company, etc. The words were extremely shocking. It has been verified that the Fuji Transportation Company in Gaoshou Lane was organized by Du Youliang and Chen Jinrong in 1927. It joined the trade association as a member and submitted a request to the Social Bureau to transfer it to the Municipal Government for registration, and it obtained a license as proof. The items transported by our company are exclusively engaged in the fruit business on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway. Other rival loans and contraband goods are not transported. This can be investigated. Moreover, our company has never known Feng Laosi. How can we be involved out of thin air? Except for other parts of Feng Laosi, we will not hear about it. All of Feng Laosi's opening of the Fuji Transportation Company does not match the facts and damages our company's reputation. I hereby submit a letter to clarify the situation and ask the Honorable Editor to correct the situation to reveal the truth. Respectfully yours, Du Youliang and Chen Jinyuan of the Fuji Transportation Company, September 11th.</p>

<p>Lost Twice in a Row In the second set, Pan Lai took a 3-1 lead, but Crawford fought back to win it. Crawford then won the third set, with his magnificent backhand strokes earning him many points.</p>
<p>Final Victory In the last two sets, Pan Lai completely controlled his opponent, losing only one game in both sets. Pan Lai's serve was fierce and frightening, while Crawford seemed helpless.</p>
<p>Knee Injury Affects The wind was very strong, causing many double faults for both sides. It should also be noted that Crawford injured his knee when he fell during his semi-final victory over Shields. The extent of the impact is difficult to say.</p>
<h3>Li Huitang Suffering from Pneumonia</h3>
<p>(Batavia Correspondence) Mr. Li Huitang fell ill at the beginning of this month. The president of the Chinese Qunli Sports Association, Mr. Zhong Wensheng, introduced him to Dr. Fu Lan's clinic for diagnosis on August 22nd. According to Dr. Wang, Mr. Li is suffering from pleurisy and was instructed to return for further diagnosis at 8:00 AM on the 23rd, including an X-ray examination. The X-ray confirmed the diagnosis of pleurisy, requiring hospitalization for rest. Therefore, that afternoon, Mr. Li was admitted to the Yansheng Hospital. On the 24th, Dr. Wang told Mr. Li that the X-ray showed that his lungs and heart were fine, but there was fluid in the pleura. With hospitalization and rest, he could recover in a month or a month and a half. Mr. Li, having read in a certain Chinese newspaper that he had a lung injury, feared that his relatives and friends would worry. Several friends visited him at the hospital to inquire about his condition. He explained the condition in detail and especially conveyed the findings of Dr. Wang's examination to the newspaper, in order to allay the concerns of his relatives and friends.</p>

<h3>Diary of the British Wimbledon World Tennis Championships (10)</h3>
<p>Special Correspondent from London - Yi Zhi Ji</p>
<p>Friday, July 7th</p>
<p>A great championship final that requires five sets to decide the winner is an uncommon exception. Generally, only three or four sets are needed, and there are few highlights. But at least two historically memorable matches are completely the opposite. In 1919, Lee Williams defeated Johnston at Forest Hills, making a comeback in the fifth set after trailing 0-3. Many spectators said it was the best tennis they had ever seen. Today, Crawford of Sydney, Australia, defeated Barnes, the defending champion and current All-American champion, also requiring five sets to decide the winner. Both players displayed the best tennis ever seen, with the two sides evenly matched, each winning two sets and each winning four games. Spectators said that the match should have ended there, so that neither player would lose their glory.</p>
<p>Barnes (Right) Crawford (Left) Photo before the final</p>
<p>The scene on the court was extremely satisfying. The weather was mild, the sun was shining, and there was a light breeze. The central court was packed with people, the atmosphere was excellent, and the sightlines were also satisfactory. The only flaw was that one of Barnes' shots landed at least two inches beyond the baseline but was not called out. The request for silence from the referee became monotonous, often requiring waiting one or two seconds before calling the decision. The spectators' hopes for a British champion were extremely high, as it had been eleven years since Patterson. The applause for Crawford was deafening, and when the victory was decided, some spectators jumped for joy, some shouted wildly, hats flew in the air, women were crying and laughing, and some even fainted. It was said that Mrs. Crawford was also among them.</p>
<p>Both sides demonstrated the highest level of sportsmanship. After several games on both sides, the two players walked very calmly to the referee's chair, took towels to wipe their sweat, without fear or shame.</p>
<p>After the women's doubles, the two players slowly entered the court. Barnes practiced with McDougall on the outer court, as did Crawford. Then they entered the court at the same time. Crawford brought a towel and both held rackets in their hands. Crawford won the coin toss for the right to serve first. Throughout the five sets, if a set ended with an even number of games, then Crawford would retain the right to serve first.</p>
<p>Barnes won the first set 6-4, and then won his service game after leading 5-2. In the second set, he often attacked, but was strongly resisted by Crawford. Crawford gradually gained control of his opponent's cannonball serve, and then often broke it. Sometimes the ball would stop after hitting the net, and sometimes the ball would return, and so on, until the end of the match. Barnes' scoring on his serve gradually decreased. In addition to this great control of the serve, Crawford's confidence also gradually increased, and his position also advanced to within three to five feet of the baseline. This was nothing less than a replay of the French Three Musketeers Lacoste and Cochet breaking through Tilden's cannonball serve. As Crawford gradually stabilized, Barnes began to waver.</p>
<p>Crawford's first reason for victory was his smooth and solid returns. Unless there was no other way, he never failed to return the ball. Barnes was naturally greatly disappointed, unable to put all his strength into his serve. Initially, it was successful, but as Crawford regained his strength, his success declined accordingly. In the twelfth game of the second set, he made many mistakes and finally could not recover. The third set also belonged to Crawford, and the fourth set to Barnes. After the two sides tied at two sets each, the serious situation was seen. Barnes missed a volley, giving away this important game, otherwise the situation would have been greatly changed. After that, Crawford's situation stabilized and went smoothly. (To be continued on July 7th)</p>

<h3>Expansion of the Physical Education Department at the Patriotic Girls' School</h3>
<p>The physical education specialty program at the Patriotic Girls' School on Jiangwan Road is a leader among physical education schools in Shanghai. Its graduates serve at home and abroad, numbering over a thousand people. Recently, due to rapid advancements in physical education teaching methods, the school's principal, Sun Xiangzhong, has carefully planned and expanded the physical education facilities, such as the gym, track, bathroom, and music room, to ensure that everything is available. In addition to the existing physical education teachers, the school has also hired Chen Fen, a equipment specialist with a degree in education from Dongda, and Cai Ximin, a dance expert who graduated from the former YWCA physical education department, to teach. Alumni of the school's physical education program who wish to pursue further study in various subjects can also have their tuition waived.</p>

<h3>The Centennial of Charles' Birth</h3>
<p>— Yu Dafu</p>
<p>When Charles (Ferdinand von Saar) is mentioned, people may feel strange, because this name is rarely seen in Chinese literary publications or translations. This is inevitable. Not to mention China, even in English-speaking countries like England and America, where foreign literature is translated and introduced the most, it is unlikely that there will be a translation of Charles's works. But in Germany, especially in his native Austria, he was praised by several knowledgeable critics, both before and after his death, as a first-class immortal writer comparable to Gottfried Keller and Theodor Storm.</p>
<p>Charles was born on September 30, 1833, into an aristocratic family in Vienna. Although it was an aristocratic family that rose from officials, most of whom were incorruptible officials, this Austrian official family had no property; therefore, Charles was forced by livelihood and joined the military at a young age to make a living. In 1860, he was tired of military life and was stirred by his inner impulses. Although he knew that writing was an unreliable way to make a living, he resolutely withdrew from the army and began to work as a writer. At that time, the treatment of writers in Austria was probably worse than in China today. If Charles had not been protected by the two noble ladies, Elisabeth Salm, Countess of Salm, and Josephine von Wertheimstien, he would have starved to death long ago. He wrote many poems and poetic dramas, and many short stories with a limited outline, sad and beautiful, and with an unparalleled tone. He did not receive the praise of some critics until he was sixty years old. In order to commend the achievements of national poets, the Austrian government appointed him as a member of the House of Lords. This was certainly a national special honor unparalleled since the great playwright Grillparzer.</p>
<p>On July 23, 1906, at the age of seventy-three, this lonely great poet, who had long suffered from cancer and remained single, committed suicide with a pistol after going out for a walk in the morning. His complete works in twelve volumes, bound in four books, were published by Max Hesse of Leipzig, with a detailed biography by Anton Bettelheim attached.</p>
<p>He himself thought that his poems and dramas were his most satisfying works, but his immortal fame clearly depended on his dozens of short stories. A special article will be written to introduce his works. Here, only a very rough outline of his life is conveyed to express admiration.</p>
<h3>"Only Death is a Profit"</h3>
<p>— Yu Jun</p>
<p>In a school's teachers' lounge, although there were many people, only a few were talking and laughing. These were all Hunanese. Hunanese have always stubbornly stuck to their hometown accents until death. Their tones were particularly high, and they loved to compete to speak. Others who wanted to join in the conversation seemed to have no way to participate, and often became dazed and silent. Among this dazed and silent group, there was a man around thirty years old, wearing an untidy Western suit. His beard could never be completely shaved, and it covered his thin, black face in a messy way. His lower jaw protruded slightly outward, causing his two rows of teeth to lose their balance. The lower teeth, like swords and halberds, seemed ready to counterattack upwards, while the upper teeth resisted desperately. Someone came over and introduced him: "This is our fellow townsman, Mr. Peng Jiahua," and I knew he was also from Hunan. After shaking hands and exchanging greetings, he lowered his head and mechanically drew on the tablecloth with chalk, still dazed and silent.</p>
<p>One day, I happened to meet him at the train station, and he ran over.</p>
<p>"Where is XX now?"</p>
<p>"In Shanghai."</p>
<p>"Life is still very difficult, isn't it?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Why don't you write for a living?"</p>
<p>"It's also difficult. Materials, talent, and sales are not easy things... "</p>
<p>The train whistled. He hurriedly said goodbye and got on the train. "Yes, he is writing for a living," I thought.</p>
<p>From then on, he was not seen in the teachers' lounge for a long time. I asked someone familiar with him, and they said he felt very bored and resigned. At that time, everyone there seemed to feel very bored, but no one resigned.</p>
<p>As time passed, his image gradually faded in my mind and was forgotten. One day, I suddenly saw the news of his arrest in the newspaper, and I was very surprised. The charges were terribly serious. In fact, this kind of charge, like a prevalent germ, floats around in the world every day. Whoever bumps into it is unlucky, but bumping into his head felt somewhat different. Acquaintances were very worried about him, but he escaped the hand of death as if he had escaped the invasion of germs. After that, I lost contact with him.</p>
<p>Until this year, one day, Mengke came back from outside and said to me, "Do you know Peng Huang?"</p>
<p>"I know him."</p>
<p>"He talked to me about you and wants to come and see you!"</p>
<p>"Hmm."</p>
<p>One day in late August, I had not yet gotten out of bed when a guest came to visit. Upon meeting him, it was indeed Mr. Peng Jiahua. His Western suit was a bit neater, but the rest was the same as before, without much change. However, his face was no longer black, but pale. That deathly pallor made people feel sad. We talked about our situations since we last met, and we were talking happily when another friend came. He became dazed and silent again, and finally couldn't sit still and left.</p>
<p>A few days later, Mengke came again and told me that he was sick, very seriously. I thought I should go see him, but for some reason, I've just been lazy lately, letting the days slip by, until I received the news of his death.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, wasn't he sitting in the chair I'm sitting in now? Wasn't he still talking about past dreams, future dreams? But now he's dead! He wrote all his life, and everyone is familiar with his name, but no one talks about his work, there is no praise, and no criticism. If this is loneliness, then he worked in loneliness, and died in loneliness! I thought of his dream, I thought of the day Mengke took the quick sketch of him, and he said, "It's very similar, very similar," but too scary, too scary"! Friend, what are you afraid of? You probably still don't know that the place you will eventually reach is right in front of you!</p>
<p>Chekhov, in Rothschild's Fiddle, said, "There is at least one benefit to a person's death: they can't eat, drink, pay taxes, or harm others; moreover, a person sleeps in a grave for more than a year, they can sleep for thousands of years, ten thousand years; for thousands of years, ten thousand years, not eating, drinking, paying taxes, or harming others, what a great benefit that is!" However, Rothschild made coffins for people, made coffins for his wife, and at the same time played the violin in the Jewish band he hated. When he was dying, he couldn't help but think: "Life has just passed like this, without any benefit, without any satisfaction, everything has passed by in a blur, and nothing has been retained." Therefore, Chekhov sighed: "In short, human life is a loss, only death is a profit!" This meaning is very good, but it is very piercing; a person only lives in this world once, why is the world arranged in such a way that he has no benefit in his life?" I will use these words as an elegy for the dead!</p>
<h3>Not a Defense</h3>
<p>— Lou Jiannan</p>
<p>Someone told me that Mr. Mu wrote an article criticizing my translated book. I knew it must be about 20th-century European literature, because during the period of translating that book, I experienced two major events, the September 18th Incident and the January 28th Incident. My life was extremely chaotic, but on the one hand, for the sake of livelihood, I had to reluctantly continue that work. I remember on the morning of January 29, 1932, I escaped alone from the artillery alley on North Sichuan Road, leaving everything behind, only taking out that original book. Work accomplished in such a life should naturally accept sincere examination. But today, after seeing Mr. Mu's article, I thought that while translating a work of over 100,000 words does not allow for any mistakes, writing a critique of over 1,000 words also seems to require some prudence. For example, Mr. Mu said that my translation of Msxim du Khan is fabricated. Unfortunately, he did not note the non-fabricated original name, and stubbornly insisted that there is no such person as Maxsim Kahn, as if even the original author, Fréchet, were colluding with me to deceive people. I know that Mr. Mu has a deep understanding of French literature, so why didn't he check carefully? Because at least this name was not fabricated by me. I remember that at that time, I consulted many books just to find the original text of the transliteration of proper nouns. Regarding Kahn, it was probably based on the Xiaoshuo Yuebao World Literature issue (20th Anniversary Publication). From this point, I wonder whether Mr. Mu's other original text comparisons are all reliable. Unfortunately, I don't even have the leisure to find my own translation and the original text. Fortunately, there are many new tasks to be done, and it is not necessary to defend my past. Moreover, I knew from the beginning that the translation was a thankless task, so even if Mr. Mu's criticism is a bit reckless, I can sincerely accept it.</p>
<h3>Words of a Bibliomaniac</h3>
<p>— A Ying</p>
<p>In the past, there were many bibliomaniacs who had a very strong interest in books. In old poems, the so-called "diligently reading thousands of volumes," and "spending all the gold to collect books," are all about how passionate these people were about books. However, this is said of people who had money to buy books. Those who didn't have money to buy books couldn't do that. Some of them ran to bookstores and stood there "skimming" to read, some stood with their hands behind their backs, staring blankly at the book titles on the shelves, some ran hundreds of miles to beg for mercy at the doors of book collectors, and some, as Guo Moruo wrote, found a good opportunity to "shoplift" the books they loved. People without money also had their own ways. These things are scattered in ancient books and are very interesting. From this, we can see how many people who worked hard in their studies used to overcome the difficulties of not having books with such arduous spirit. Although I myself have not achieved anything in my studies, I have been constantly walking this difficult path. Therefore, when reading, I pay special attention to this kind of event. Now, I will write down the more meaningful parts and make it into a "Words of a Bibliomaniac!" Among the readers, there will probably be no shortage of people who like to read such stories. This can be considered a "preface."</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>At the end of the Ming Dynasty, the richest book collection south of the Yangtze River belonged to Qian Muzhai. He had many fine Song and Yuan editions. Unfortunately, he encountered a fire, and these books were turned to ashes, except for those in the eastern city. Among them was a Song edition of the History of the Former and Later Han Dynasties of the Northern Song Dynasty. Muzhai bought this book for only three hundred taels of gold, because two volumes of the "History of the Later Han Dynasty" were missing, and the seller specially reduced the price. Muzhai regarded this book as very precious and entrusted many booksellers to find the missing volumes to complete it. One of them, on one occasion, stopped his boat in Wuzhen and went ashore to buy noodles for dinner. The noodle shop owner took out two books from a broken basket as wrapping paper. The bookseller saw that they were Song editions of the "History of the Later Han Dynasty," and they were precisely the two volumes Muzhai was missing. He was very happy and negotiated with the noodle shop owner, spending "a few coins" to buy them. But one of the volumes was missing the first page. He asked the noodle shop owner, who said that the neighbor across the street had just asked him to wrap the noodles, so the bookseller went to the neighbor across the street and asked for that page as well. He rushed to Changzhou overnight and delivered it to Muzhai. Muzhai was overjoyed and threw a good banquet to treat him to dinner, and gave him twenty taels of gold. This book was taken away by "those in important positions" in the early Qing Dynasty. So it is recorded in the "Anecdotes of Muzhai."</p>
<h3>Shallow Lake (II)</h3>
<p>— Written by Joseph Conrad, translated by Shi Heng</p>
<p>This narrow tributary is like a ditch: winding and bottomless in its depths; under the narrow, clear, cyan canopy of the sky, it is filled with dimness. Huge trees, hidden behind the dense net of vines, stand tall. Near the glittering black water, amidst the network of small ferns, one can see the distorted roots of large trees everywhere, gloomy and dark, still and winding, like captured snakes. The short words of the boatmen echoed in the thick, dim grass walls. Darkness, from among the trees, through the tangled thickets of vines, from behind the fantastically still, large leaves, flowed out; this darkness, mysterious and invisible, is like the darkness of the fragrant and poisonous forest where one cannot set foot.</p>
<p>The boatmen pushed their poles in the shallow water, and the gap opened up, forming a vast, still lake. The forest retreated from the damp shore, leaving a green meadow of reeds, reflecting the cyan of the sky. A woolly, peach-colored cloud floated in the sky, reflecting the subtle colors of the floating clouds below the leaves of the lotus flowers and the silver blossoms. A small house built on stakes looked dark and hollow from a distance. Next to the house, two tall palm trees, as if reaching up from behind the forest, leaned on the uneven roof. The tilt of the leafy and towering tree tops made it seem as if they had sorrowful thoughts.</p>
<p>The helmsman, pointing with his paddle, said, "Asat's house is over there. I saw his boat tied to the stakes."</p>
<p>The boatmen ran along the edge of the boat, turning their faces to look at the end of their day's journey. They would rather spend the night anywhere than in this eerie and legendary haunted shallow lake. In addition, they didn't like Asat, first because he was a stranger, and second because he repaired a damaged house and lived in it, and claimed that he was not afraid to live with the spirits that bewitched this abandoned place. Such a person would disrupt the direction of fate with his eyes and words; at the same time, the spirits he was familiar with were not easy to reconcile with passing travelers, and they often wanted to avenge their masters on passers-by. White people do not believe these things, because they are pagans, and are allied with the "spirit master", so the "spirit master" will make them safely cross this fantastic land. If righteous people warn them, they pretend not to believe it. What else can be done?</p>
<p>The boatmen pondered in this way as they pushed their poles. The large dugout canoe quickly, quietly, and smoothly moved towards Asat's reclaimed land, until the dropped pole made a loud sound, and people murmured, "Allah, praise be!" The boat gently bumped against the stakes, reaching the bottom of the house.</p>
<p>The boatmen looked up and shouted discordantly, "Asat! Hey, Asat!" But no one came. The white man began to climb the ladder on the bamboo platform in front of the house. The captain said unhappily, "We will cook on the sampan and sleep on the water." "Pass me the blankets and baskets," the white man said listlessly.</p>
<p>He knelt on the edge of the bamboo platform and took the things. Then the boat moved, and the white man stood up, facing Asat, because he had already walked out of the small doorway of the house. He was a strong and vigorous young man, with a broad chest and muscular arms. He was wearing only a pair of shorts. His head was shaved. His large, gentle eyes were intensely fixed on the white man, but his voice and attitude did not contain a trace of courtesy; he suddenly asked:</p>
<p>"Do you have medicine with you, Tu An?"</p>
<p>"No," the visitor said in a surprised tone. "No. What's wrong? Is there a patient in this house?" "Go in and see," Asat said in the same calm tone, then suddenly turned and walked into the door of the house. The white man, putting down his luggage, followed him.</p>

<h3>Financial Foreign Cables Unfavorable, Panic, Spot Gold Falls by Ten Dollars and Four Cents</h3>
<p>Pittman Suggests Raising the Price of Silver</p>
<p>US Secretary of Agriculture Indicates Inflationary Currency</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market weakened due to the contraction of the overseas silver market in England and the United States. Exchange rates also fell.

US wheat contracted by 1/125. Stocks rose and fell. London bullion was also cheap. The opening offer was stable, but it was only a flash in the pan and immediately fell below 30 yuan. This was because reports indicated that US Senator Pittman had submitted a plan to President Roosevelt. If adopted, the price of silver could be raised to $1.19 per ounce. Many small investors frantically shorted. However, large players maintained the price by buying on dips. The opening was still flat. After the opening, it remained flat. By the time HSBC quoted the exchange rate, it had not moved. After the announcement, the exchange market suddenly hardened. Reuters reported that US Secretary of Agriculture Wallace indicated that there may be currency inflation within three months. The main method was to minimize the gold content in US dollars. Rumors spread, triggering a slump. However, there were still several rebounds. The market was flat and then epidemic, with extreme panic. Small investors desperately pressed down, but they were always at a disadvantage. After the close, it was even worse. The premium price was increased by 270 yuan.

Hengchangyong entered strips, pulling up slightly less than 1 yuan, but US dollars at 625 for December also seemed difficult to sell. Zhifengyong sold strips. The close was 823 yuan and 6 jiao. After the close, suppliers continued to pour in, frantically cutting longs. The situation worsened. Goods were auctioned at 2 yuan and 5 jiao. Finally, it fell again to within 1 yuan.

<h3>The Financial Market is Particularly Busy at the Beginning of the Week</h3>
<p>The market atmosphere of yesterday's silver dollar and money industry was more prosperous than usual because it was Monday. However, judging from yesterday's situation, it was particularly vigorous. The reason is that various goods were launched, and the transportation of goods in major cities was very congested. The demand for funds was also very complicated. Therefore, the silver and money industry had a particularly large amount of collection and settlement. However, due to the surplus of funds and the abundant deposits, even if the uses are complex, it still cannot stimulate its market price. Therefore, the price of foreign exchange was only six points in the morning and afternoon, which was slightly better than the previous day by two points, but compared with the previous week, it was still only three or four points. The addition of water to the header was still not priced, and it was always a white line. The transaction of short-term bills was over 5 million in the morning session, and the new transaction was over 1.3 million. The transaction in the afternoon session was over 300,000. The total transaction in the small association was over 600,000. The bank collection and settlement, the foreign bank collection and settlement of bills was 2.78 million, and the foreign exchange was 3.89 million. The special collection and settlement of silver was 3.56 million. The collection and settlement of exchange, pledge, electricity, and other goods was 5.34 million in silver and over 6.2 million in foreign exchange. The silver withdrawn from the warehouse was 800,000 and 1 million in foreign exchange. The collection and settlement of bills by Chinese banks was over 4.3 million, the collection and settlement of various exchange taxes, pledges, etc. was over 6.78 million, the special collection and settlement was 4.78 million, and the withdrawal from the warehouse was 600,000. The collection and settlement of Japanese banks was also considerable. The silver deposited in the warehouse was 700,000 and 600,000 in foreign exchange. The collection and settlement of foreign public receipts of money houses was over 48 million, and the collection and settlement of foreign headers was over 8.4 million. The remittance from various routes was over 800,000, the collection of money was over 1 million, and the foreign exchange pledge transaction was estimated at over 1.3 million for new transactions, and the redemption was 670,000. The entry and exit of banknotes was 2.56 million. The source from the passenger route was 100,000, and the departure was 150,000. In addition, the total number of exchanges in the clearing house was 6,258,782 yuan, 3 jiao, and 8 fen in silver coins, including 3,461,050 yuan, 0 jiao, and 3 fen in silver coins, and 2,797,732 yuan and 0 jiao and 5 fen in exchange silver coins.</p>
<h3>Subsidiary Coins are Traded Lightly and Consistently Downstream</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Jiangnan's small foreign currency was still traded lightly and downstream. The morning and afternoon markets were both at 839 yuan, which was suddenly 9 jiao lower than the previous day. There were also few transactions. The morning market was 7,500 jiao, and the afternoon market was 5,500 jiao. The Guangdong small foreign currency was 791 yuan in the morning market and 788 yuan and 5 jiao in the afternoon market. As a result, it fell sharply by 5 yuan compared with the afternoon market on the previous day. The transactions were 85,000 jiao in the morning market and 40,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins were unchanged. The morning and afternoon markets were the same at 315,500 texts, with transactions of 41,015 strings, totaling 13,000 yuan in price.</p>
<h3>Contents of Silver Coin Assays for August</h3>
<p>According to the Central Mint Assay Committee's August review of legal new coins, totaling 3,840,000 yuan, as reported in the previous issue, a sample of 397 silver dollars was taken for assay. The average fineness was found to be 880.56, exceeding the standard by 0.063%. The average pure silver content per coin was 22.507166 grams, exceeding the standard weight by 0.013718, or 0.058%. The average weight was 26.6957 grams, falling short of the standard by 0.0014, or 0.005%.</p>
<h3>Bond Market Shrouded in Securities Rumors</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange saw relatively active trading, but market prices remained weak. Rumors circulated that the government would issue new public bonds. However, after inquiries by reporters, it was said that the Central Political Council had decided not to issue new public bonds temporarily to avoid increasing the burden on the public. Despite this, market prices continued to decline. The fundamental situation had not changed, but there were speculations that the government might continue to issue 50 million yuan of 20-year disaster relief bonds to make up for the previous incomplete issuance. Whether this speculation is accurate remains to be seen. Yesterday's market performance showed that during the morning session, scattered buyers were not inactive in the initial trading. Prices for consolidation bonds to the 1929 Customs Bonds rose by ten cents to forty cents. As trading shifted to the twenty-year bonds, sellers gradually emerged, and market prices declined. Market sentiment shifted, with more empty positions. Prices gradually fell, retracing by ten cents to thirty-five cents. During the afternoon session, all factions shifted their strategies, leaning towards selling. Major players began selling off, and prices continued to fall by ten cents to forty-five cents. The afternoon session saw sales of issues 31 and 38, with lingering unease and few buyers. The trend remained uncertain, and prices continued to fall slightly by twenty or thirty cents. At the close, only the Salt Tax bonds showed a slight rebound of five to ten cents, while other issues remained weak, generally falling by ten to twenty cents. Short-selling of gold was most prevalent, with a total decrease of over seventy cents for the day, while other issues fell by fifteen cents to sixty cents. The market did not experience a major crash. The total transaction volume was 9,221,000 yuan, including 6,000 yuan in spot transactions. Futures trading included 3,490,000 yuan for Salt Tax, 1,330,000 yuan for Military Reorganization bonds, 1,245,000 yuan for the 1929 Customs Bonds, 1,735,000 yuan for the 20-year and 20-year Customs Bonds, and varying amounts from tens of thousands to three or five hundred thousand yuan for other issues. The exchange's stock was traded at 59 yuan for ten shares.</p>
<h3>New York Stock Market Stabilizes</h3>
<p>According to a report from Sincere &amp; Co., the New York stock market on the 9th was one of the dullest days of the week. Prices showed little fluctuation. Steel tonnage and rail transport increased more than expected, making the market outlook for Monday promising. The total trading volume for the day was 279,000 shares. Wheat news was weak across the board, lacking buying interest. Reports of rain in Argentina caused market relaxation. Although it was anticipated that the government would announce a two-year plan to reduce cotton acreage to 25,000,000 acres and guarantee reasonable prices and improve the textile market, this failed to generate sufficient new buying power to absorb the Southern output. The Dow Jones indices are listed below:</p>
<p>Closing Price 　　Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks　　99.42　Down 0.1620 Railroad Stocks　　49.11　Down 0.1520 Utility Stocks　　29.20　Down 0.0640 Bonds　　　86.61　Down 0.12</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton Futures Follow the Decline in US Cotton</h3>
<p>The yarn market is weakening, with prices falling again. Market sentiment is scattered, lacking any revitalization. Sales of spot yarn are sluggish, and the earlier rumors of support for the yarn market have faded. As a result, long positions are closing, and overseas cotton prices continue to decline, weakening confidence and making the future uncertain.</p>
<p>(Cotton Futures Decline)</p>
<p>The Shanghai Cotton Exchange opened with continued declines in US cotton, leading to a lack of buyers and scattered sentiment. Prices for all months fell by 3, 4, and 5 cents. In the afternoon, news of weak actual demand caused prices for all months to fall by another 4, 6, and 8 cents. The total trading volume for the day was 20,200 bales. Major sellers included Dachang (1,400 bales), Yongda (850 bales), and Minghua (700 bales). Major buyers included Changfeng (1,400 bales), Gengfeng (700 bales), Senkang (650 bales), and Yuanda (700 bales). Closing prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Shanghai Cotton Exchange Closing Prices, Changes, and Open Interest:December 18.64 Down 0.09 54,600September 18.19 Down 1.0 41,600January 18.74 Down 1.3 62,650October 18.36 Down 1.0 65,500February 18.81 Down 1.2 16,950November 18.52 Down 0.09 69,550Total 310,900</p>
<p>(Yarn Sales Remain Sluggish)</p>
<p>Sales of spot yarn are quite sluggish. Total purchases by all factions for the day were only 402 bales. Prices are flat. Purchases by each faction were as follows:</p>
<p>Nanjing 5　Inland 130　Shantou 30　Ningbo 24　Northern Faction 25　Guangdong 105　Hankou 50　Jiangxi 2　Brokers 27</p>
<p>The cotton market is trending downward due to the decline in US cotton, weakening confidence. Recent weather has been good, and the new cotton crop is doing well. Sellers show no inclination to resist price declines, while foreign merchants are buying on the dips, accumulating larger and larger volumes, leading some to expect higher prices. However, the poor yarn market is hindering mill demand. Prices in various producing areas remain stable, so there are fewer hedging sales than in previous days. Nevertheless, the overseas cotton market is weak, while domestic cotton is still holding steady.</p>
<p>(Zhengzhou Cotton Futures See Renewed Selling Pressure)</p>
<p>At the opening of the Zhengzhou Cotton Exchange, overseas cotton prices were slightly lower, and there were few buyers in the market. Long positions were closing, and prices for all months fell by ten to twenty cents. In the afternoon, private news indicated further potential declines in US cotton, leading to renewed selling pressure, and prices for all months fell by twenty to thirty cents. The total trading volume for the day was 70,700 dan. Major sellers included Mingde (4,100 dan), Yuanda (3,100 dan), and Xincheng (3,800 dan), and Changfeng (2,100 dan). Major buyers included Yuanda (4,200 dan), Dafu (3,300 dan), Jifeng (2,000 dan), Senkang (2,000 dan), Changhe (2,100 dan), and Yiqi (1,500 dan). Closing prices are as follows:</p>

<p>Demand for spot cotton remains flat. Sources include Yao Flower:</p>

<h3>Bombay Cotton Market Weekly Report</h3>
<p>The market was quiet last week, with prices declining slightly following US cotton. Speculators made some purchases on the dips, and short positions were covered. However, as US cotton continued to fall, buyers hesitated, causing market sentiment to soften again. In the spot market, the Far East was relatively inactive, while exports to Europe showed progress. Poor conditions at local spinning mills led to weak cotton demand. The weather was good, and the new cotton crop showed significant progress during the week. The weekly statistics are appended below (in thousands of bales):</p>

<p>Grains: Hexia Rice Continues to Weaken Slightly</p>
<p>(Shanghai South)</p>
<p>Nearly forty sources of rice arrived today. Both wholesale and retail demand were acceptable, but due to a slight increase in arrivals, sentiment turned soft, resulting in flat conditions. Consequently, the prices of thick japonica, Duyang tip, and new tip rice from various factions fell slightly. Although the Shandong faction for thin indica rice brought in nearly 2,000 packages, buyers were very demanding and preferred mid- to low-quality rice. The prices of high-quality thin indica rice fell by more than ten cents, while mid- to low-quality rice remained stable. Bian Yuan also weakened. New Hexia japonica was stable to soft.</p>
<p>(Shanghai Central)</p>
<p>Yesterday, twenty-three or four sources of rice arrived from Hexia Road. Sales of various types of rice remained sluggish. Market prices for northern japonica and early rice weakened by several cents. Anticipated prices for lower-quality thin indica weakened. Prices for new and old Yangjian and Tuanjian rice were slightly softer. Prices for old Dujian, new Kehpu tip, and Dongxin japonica remained similar to previous levels. Bai Yuan showed a slightly softer trend.</p>
<h3>Fujianese Faction Actively Purchases New Kehsien Rice</h3>
<p>Old Luomi Rice Newly Offered for Sale</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Fujianese-style Kehsien rice market was very active. The Quanzhou faction inquired about prices after arriving on the market yesterday. Because the situation in Fuzhou has recently stabilized and people's minds are at ease, the demand has increased to the point of greed. The Xinghua faction also arrived on the market to try to purchase. Sales from various sources in Fujian Province are all active. Market prices jumped ten cents. In all, the Quanzhou faction bought 140 packages of Hunan Jingxin rice for 6.30 yuan and 355 packages of coarse new rice for 5.35 yuan. 1,000 packages of Nanjing warehouse new rice were sold for 6.45 yuan to 6.23 yuan, all of which were bought by the Fuzhou faction. The Xinghua faction bought 141 packages of Nanjing new coarse rice for 5.20 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign rice is still being resisted. Small-grain Saigon rice is welcomed by the Zhejiang faction and brokers, but price negotiations have not been successful, and the rice remains packaged but unopened. However, 1,300 packages of Yu Luomi rice that arrived in Shanghai last year are still in the hands of hoarders. Yesterday, 400 packages were bought by brokers for 7.78 yuan. The remaining nearly 1,000 packages are also planned to be sold off in the coming days.</p>
<h3>Tianjinese Faction Actively Purchases Flour</h3>
<p>丨But It Still Cannot Supplement the Market···Flour and Wheat Both Decline</p>
<p>The flour mills are actively selling, and foreign wheat is also down by sixty or seventy cents, so the market continues to decline. However, demand has increased, with 80,000 packages of Green Cannon brand flour being purchased at a price that is 1.5 cents below the standard. Another 50,000 packages of miscellaneous brands were also purchased, all of which were shipped from Tianjin. This is due to brisk sales and rising prices in Tianjin. However, there is too much flour stored in Shanghai, and this small amount cannot support the market, so the flour market remains weak. At the close, this month was down one cent, October and November were each down 1.25 cents, December and January were each down one cent, and February was down half a cent.</p>
<p>After the wheat market opened, people's minds remained unsettled. Merchants, unable to sell spot wheat smoothly, focused on hedging futures. Forward months saw short selling as merchants and new shorts were both selling off. After the opening, the market declined step by step. At the close, September to November were each down four cents, December was down two cents, January was down five cents, and February was down seven cents. Spot wheat: Tongyuan sold for 7.20 yuan and Gaoyou sold for 3.67 yuan to 3.65 yuan, totaling 5,000 packages, all of which were purchased by Xinda.</p>
<h3>Jiujiang Beans Fall to the 4 Yuan Mark</h3>
<p>Jiujiang beans, once vigorously sold by the Guangdong faction, have seen their market collapse since that faction stopped buying. Yesterday, the price of Chengmen beans in the market fell to the 4 yuan mark, triggering a wave of sales. Fuzhou, Wenzhou, inland, and brokers all inquired, and a total of 1,600 packages were sold at prices ranging from 3.98 yuan to 3.89 yuan. 387 packages of Duchang beans were sold for 3.90 yuan. Gaoyang Qing beans, both high and low grades, totaled 209 packages. The high-grade beans were priced at 4.20 yuan and were purchased by the Xiamen faction. The low-grade beans were priced at 3.90 yuan and were purchased by the inland faction.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Refined Granulated White Sugar Recovers Slightly by Ten Cents</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market weakened with the decline in Customs Gold Units. The Shanghai Sugar Merchants Association set an initial price of 21.60 yuan for 24th grade refined granulated white sugar, down five cents. The subsequent price was set at 21.55 yuan, down another five cents. The sugar itself, if relatively damp, was priced at 4.88 yuan. Re-export bills of lading were opened at 8.025 Dutch guilders. No price was set for 20th grade medium granulated white sugar. High-grade sugar was priced at approximately 21.10 yuan. Dutch PK brand red sugar remained at 16.65 yuan. Taikoo Sugar B brand was priced at 21.80 yuan, and CW brand was priced at 21.70 yuan. The Chaozhou faction only offered a few dozen packages of Gaobainanqing sugar for 14.90 yuan.</p>
<h3>Prices of Dried Longan and Longan Pulp Rise</h3>
<p>(Dried Longan)</p>
<p>Recently, the price of new goods has risen, and the price of old goods has also risen. Yesterday, a small number of goods were offered for sale. High-grade goods with red pulp were priced up by three or four yuan, and others also rose by one or two yuan. The market is showing signs of tightening.</p>
<p>(Longan Pulp)</p>
<p>Since Hainan new longan pulp maintained its price of 50 yuan, the market has tightened. Recently, due to the scarcity of arrivals, merchants have been buying according to the previous price, so the price of 50 yuan has actually been reached, up by 5.5 yuan from the first batch. Old goods have risen accordingly.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Reduced Autumn Cocoon Harvest in Southern Jiangsu</h3>
<p>(Poor Quality and Reduced Yield of Late Autumn Cocoons in Jiangyin)</p>
<p>In various townships in Jiangyin, such as Changshou and Changjing, this year's autumn cocoon season is more than half a month earlier than usual. The yield of early cocoons is still good, but the yield of late cocoons has been reduced due to weather damage. The cocoons are thin and of poor quality. Cocoon merchants are selectively weighing and purchasing only the best cocoons. Recently, arrivals on the market have been strong, with high-quality cocoons priced at 42-43 yuan and late cocoons priced at less than 30 yuan.</p>
<p>(Over 300 Bundles of Silk Waste Shipped to Marseille)</p>
<p>Exports of yellow and white silk waste are declining. This time, the French mail ship of the Fei Likai Lu Company only shipped 300 bundles of yellow and white silk waste from Shanghai's Baili and other companies to Marseille.</p>
<p>(Demand for Rayon Remains Active)</p>
<p>Recently, demand for rayon remains active. Yesterday, silk merchants from Pinghu and Changxing purchased 48 boxes of Ladies, Double Sparrow, and Three Flags brand rayon for prices ranging from 166.75 yuan to 162.25 yuan net.</p>
<p>(Lack of Improvement in Silk Telegrams Leads to More Sluggish Silk Sales)</p>
<p>There is still no turnaround in silk sales in Europe and America. Silk telegrams from New York and Lyon show no improvement. European and American firms in Shanghai are suppressing prices and hoarding. The factories are offering B-grade 83-point evenness silk at 710 yuan through American firms and 13/15-point silk at only 800 yuan through French firms. It is difficult for the factories to sell at these prices, and negotiations are still difficult, so silk sales remain stagnant.</p>
<h3>Increased Transactions in Fine Zhenmei Tea</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Kam Lung, Hip Wo, Wah Cha, Wing Hing and other firms showed strong interest in Fine Zhenmei Silk Tea from Wuyuan, Tunxi and other areas. More than 20 "characters" (a measure of tea) were traded throughout the city, and prices also rose slightly compared to previous levels. However, the market for ordinary Zhenmei tea remains weak, and there are still many inferior grades of Needle and Showy teas in stock. Only Gongxi Special Tea and two other items are selling briskly, and those of excellent quality sold well yesterday.</p>
<h3>Edible Oil: Tung Oil Gradually Declines</h3>
<p>| Foreign Firms Remain Inactive; Domestic Merchants Seize the Opportunity to Buy In |</p>
<p>After the foreign transaction price of white tung oil in Hankou reached 27.23 yuan per dan, the market became silent. Hankou merchants, seeing this situation, knew that a continued decline in prices was necessary to stimulate buyers' interest, so they immediately lowered the price to 26 yuan, but there were still no transactions. Now the price has fallen to 25 yuan. It is uncertain whether this will stimulate transactions, but even if there are still no transactions, or only a few, the market can stabilize and not decline further. Moreover, such a sharp decline may be an attempt by merchants to buy in order to build up a large inventory and prepare for demand from foreign firms. Otherwise, the decline would not be so large.</p>
<p>Customers' goods have also gradually declined as a result. Southern branch tung oil has fallen from 21.78 yuan and 21.34 yuan to 21 yuan, and then to 20.78 yuan in recent days. Xiangtung tung oil has also gradually declined from 21.78 yuan to 19.67 yuan today. All are customer prices. Only a week has passed, but the prices have fallen so sharply, which was really unexpected. It is said that merchants have opened up about 6,000 to 7,000 dan in this falling price environment, and the inventory has been prepared, only waiting for buyers. Therefore, it is quite accurate to say that this decline is manipulated by Hankou merchants. Local merchants in Shanghai, because it is already autumn, do not have abundant inventory, so there may be some who take this opportunity to buy, but they are generally unwilling to stock up too much. As for Zhejiang tung oil, although there are not many goods, it cannot but follow suit with the decline in Hankou. Therefore, according to reports from Hangzhou merchants, the price has also loosened to about 23 yuan per piece. It is only because sales in various places are sporadic, and there are no large numbers of transactions.</p>
<h3>Textiles: Nanjing Faction Actively Purchases Woolen Fabrics</h3>
<p>The sales of woolen fabrics have been increasing in recent years, especially Western-style suits and pullovers. Yesterday, many Western-style tailors and woolen fabric merchants from the Nanjing faction came to Shanghai to actively purchase. Most of the goods they purchased were made of mixed low-grade yarn and cotton. Pure wool high-grade goods priced at ten yuan per yard only accounted for 25% of the total.</p>
<h3>Various Sales Prices for Serge Differ</h3>
<p>Recently, the autumn goods market is still good. Customers from all over come to Shanghai, and sales are still brisk. However, the prices of goods fluctuate, such as serge raincoats and Melton thick serge being cheaper, while Western-style flannel, charcoal lining, palm sleeve lining, feather yarn, sea tiger velvet, leopard velvet, long-haired camel velvet, etc. are more expensive. There are three reasons for this: 1. The amount of inventory; 2. The strength of buyers' demand; 3. The influence of Japanese dumping.</p>
<h3>Hardware: English White Iron Worsens</h3>
<p>The trade in English white iron has recently become sluggish again. Sales to customers have weakened, and sales in the local market are also very depressed. The fact that arrivals are piled up, and the supply is greater than the demand, is undeniable. The standard is oppressed by the unfavorable environment and has become a lost cause. People are increasingly panicked. (It is said that Japanese goods are secretly active, which has caused the market price to deteriorate further.) The current market price for seven-foot white iron is estimated at 1.43 yuan per sheet, 1.25 yuan per sheet for six-foot, 17.45 yuan per dan for 28 gauge, 16.40 yuan for 26 gauge, and 15.40 yuan for 24 gauge, all of which are down two to three cents to two dimes compared to the previous prices. However, there is no large business on the market. If the industry can consistently resist Japanese goods, the trend of English white iron is not without hope.</p>
<h3>Transactions in Long-Term Black Iron Sheet</h3>
<p>Black iron sheets of three feet, six feet, and three to thirteen sheets, for shipment in November and December, have been settled. The price is 9 pounds, 7 shillings, and 6 pence per ton, up two shillings and six pence compared to the previous price. It is said that a certain hardware store on North Suzhou Road has purchased more than 200 tons.</p>

<p>Essays</p>
<h3>Man is Inferior to a Dog</h3>
<p>-- Shen Yan</p>
<p>"Man is inferior to a dog" is not an idiom, nor has it ever been found in the great works of scholars of the Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties. Of course, it is not a historical allusion. However, we can often see or hear it. When mentioned, it seems very familiar. The reason is not very complex, only because people often use this sentence as an expression of deep emotion.</p>
<p>The emotion expressed by this sentence can be further divided into two types: one is mostly from expressions of admiration for dogs. These are mostly uttered by poor people living in harsh conditions and facing economic difficulties. For example, coolies and laborers, although they have five senses and four limbs, fully resembling humans, their enjoyment is truly worlds apart compared to the dogs kept by wealthy families. Similarly, we brain-working laborers often rely on our legs to walk when we go out. If we are unlucky enough to walk on a street with a lot of sewage, we are carefully moving forward along the edge of the street with our heads lowered, but a 1932 or 1933 automobile suddenly flies over from behind. The four wheels splash the mud on the street to both sides like electric fans. When you are splashed with countless specks of mud and look back with an angry gaze, you will often see a large or small dog with a slightly different appearance sitting leisurely in the car, coldly smiling at you. At this time, the emotion comes: "Man is inferior to a dog!"</p>
<p>The other type is an expression of cursing people. For example, you sacrifice one or two bowls of white rice every day to raise a dog, and it can always help you a little at night. Even if it doesn't help you, it will never turn around and bite you! Unfortunately, you make a black-hearted friend. Although you treat him with the utmost kindness, he uses vicious means to seize your property or injure your life! At that time, the people around you and yourself will inevitably say, "Man is inferior to a dog" to express their emotions.</p>
<p>In the past, I often used the phrase "Man is inferior to a dog" to express envy for dogs, but I never used it to curse people because I felt that although there really are people who are inferior to dogs, they are, after all, a small minority. In order to maintain the dignity of us humans, it is best to avoid expressing this emotion. However, in recent years, the human news that I have seen in newspapers has been almost entirely of behaviors that "even beasts would disdain to do." Seducing a sister-in-law and killing a brother, an adulterous woman killing her husband, cases involving corpses in boxes... they emerge endlessly. Not to mention that dogs would never do such things, even wolves and tigers might not be so cruel. Therefore, recently I have had a new awakening. I think that no matter how much wealthy people's dogs sit in cars, eat gourmet food, or even wear Western clothes, we are not qualified to envy them. We should examine ourselves. Do modern people's character measure up to dogs?</p>
<h3>Storm</h3>
<p>-- Fu Yizhi</p>
<p>The sequence of seasons is advancing like rubber wheels. The fiery summer has quietly disappeared without us realizing it, and the line of poetry "the sound of insects newly penetrates the green window screen" has been seized by writers to embellish articles of the "early autumn occasional feelings" type to stir up a commotion. Alas! "Yesterday's youth is today's white hair" cannot help but make me shudder at the brevity of life and the arduousness of responsibility.</p>
<p>However, although the season has reached early autumn, the climate is not changing rapidly. I mechanically continue to do very minor desk work, and the stinky sweat evaporated by the water in my body is still constantly flowing out from my thirty-six thousand pores.</p>
<p>It was an afternoon, and the stuffy air was suffocating. I knew that this was an inevitable process of climate change when it wants to cool down but is still hot, and it was a sign of a storm. We don't need to be annoyed, and we don't need to curse. We just need to endure temporarily. This climate, which is about to decline, will soon be swept away by the storm. I predicted this.</p>
<p>I walked out of the dark room. Ragged clouds covered the entire sky. The terrifying sunlight occasionally shone down a line of intense light from the gaps in the clouds, but it was soon densely blocked by the thick clouds and could no longer exert its authority.</p>
<p>Thunder rumbled like a war drum, and lightning flickered and twisted incessantly in the gray and black clouds. Undoubtedly, it was the harbinger of the storm. A pitch-black cloud in the southeast corner hung down a few sparse lines of rain, extending straight to this land where heat was lurking. Then, a few gusts of strong wind blew, and bean-sized raindrops, along with the dense black clouds, spread out their formation and shot down relentlessly. Pedestrians scurried around like birds and beasts in the face of a great disaster.</p>
<p>The earth became even darker. The garbage on the road was washed to both sides by the rainwater. The accumulated water in the puddles, under the attack of raindrops, overflowed with bubbles of colored light. Brave rickshaw pullers, pulling their rickshaws, braved the wind and rain and struggled to compete in a long-distance race with the speeding Austins. Lovers of a leisurely life hid in shops and alleys, impatiently watching, regretting, and cursing!</p>
<p>Friends! Light is behind the darkness; the storm is the "salvation army" that changes the climate. We cannot wait long, so let's move forward with the storm!</p>
<h3>"Generous Charity" and "Robots"</h3>
<p>— Zhu Yan</p>
<p>A certain Mr. said: "Nowadays, modern students are truly generous, continuously sending large sums of money earned by their parents through sweat and blood, term after term, into the school's accounting office coffers, without any stinginess. This allows the principal to sit in a small Austin car, the professors' wives to have enough money to buy high-heeled leather shoes, and the snot-nosed sons of the school workers and tea servers not to cry about being hungry. The students themselves sit high and mighty in the classroom, swinging their legs, chatting and laughing, writing 'Sweetheart,' humming 'Dream Lover.' The professors, feeling grateful, want to reciprocate with some 'knowledge' as a gift, but the students are polite, returning it all. Therefore, on their graduation diplomas, after four years, the words 'Generous Charity' should be added to commend their benevolent spirit."</p>
<p>A certain student said: "Who says that Europeans and Americans create, Japanese imitate, and Chinese don't create?" Now, the Chinese ability to imitate is thousands and millions of times greater than that of the short Japanese. Look! Europeans and Americans invented "robots" not long ago, and the Japanese haven't even succeeded in imitating them yet, but we Chinese have already produced and applied them in large quantities. If you don't believe me, look at those on the podiums in schools across the country, gesticulating, shaking their heads, reciting textbooks verbatim, directly reading from lecture notes. Aren't they all completely and utterly authentic "flesh robots?"</p>
<h3>Eating Peace</h3>
<p>— Zui Zhu</p>
<p>Every year in the seventh month, we celebrate the Taiping Gong Festival, the Ullambana Festival. Even just releasing a single Flaming Mouth is a fixed income for the "local associates," "beggar leaders," and "rascals." In general, it's called "eating peace."</p>
<p>Every year, according to old customs, in the seventh month of the lunar calendar, everyone chips in sixty or seventy cash coins to buy a few sheets of "yellow paper" and binds them into a crooked donation book. They write a few large, "ghostly" characters - Ullambana Festival - and bring the old donation book along. ... In this way, they can set out to solicit money and carry out their "calling for peace" work.</p>
<p>When this "peace troupe" sets out, they also cooperate and divide the work, each with their own responsibilities: one carries a long bamboo pole, ready to hang paper ingots; one swings a large bag, ready to store money and tin foil; and one holds the donation book, going door-to-door to solicit donations – that's the leader of the peace troupe.</p>
<p>"Ah! Excuse me, we have to bother you again. According to old customs, at the entrance of this alley, we need to release a 'Flaming Mouth' to provide relief to the lonely souls and protect the peace of the population..." These few words are their "door-knocking speech," used at every household. After saying this, without waiting for the homeowner to speak, they open the old book and say, "Last year, you gave four dimes. This year, everything is more expensive, so let's raise it a little and write eight dimes, right? This is a good deed, this is..."</p>
<p>If the homeowner doesn't agree, the one swinging the bag will try to persuade them, still writing down four dimes as before. If they agree, then next year it must be eight dimes, this is the "old custom." So their donation amount only increases and never decreases.</p>
<p>They write it down at each house, either money or ingots, until they have written at all the houses they want to write at; fortunately, they are "geographical ghosts," knowing who has just moved in, who is an old resident, who has money, who is embarrassed. They know everything completely, even more clearly than the nominal "household register." So when soliciting, they adapt to the situation, giving according to the person, and have some qualifications, and will never cause trouble.</p>
<p>On the appointed day, they get a few monks and release a Flaming Mouth. Then, on the bridgehead or alley entrance, they post a reimbursement statement, which is the ultimate "public service."</p>
<p>Don't underestimate this "reimbursement statement"; its function is the same as a "stock report" certified by an accountant in a bank. Both can consolidate credit and attract cash.</p>
<h3>The Northeast Fourth Company Commander</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Fifteen: The Guest Leaves with a Shy Smile and Tender Feelings; A Visitor Brings Old News, a Sinister Letter Opens Sadness</p>
<p>Zhao Ziqiang threw the end of the cigarette he was holding in his hand on the ground, stamped it out with his foot, and then coughed slightly twice before smiling and saying: I originally had a lot of things to say, but I'm very clumsy with words, and I simply don't know where to start. Guizhi still bit her lip, smiling slightly, and didn't answer the question. Zhao Ziqiang said seriously: I was originally tired of this military life and planned to quit. But a military officer's body isn't as free as a civil official's. Moreover, the company commander is the officer closest to the soldiers, and the company commander, the sergeant, the quartermaster, and the platoon leader all have some connection. Changing a company commander means a lot of trouble, and it's not easy to resign. Without a special reason, the superior won't approve it. There's only one way: first, take a short leave, leave the army, and then slowly write letters to the camp asking for sick leave. No matter how much the army can't let you go, they can't ask a sick person to be a company commander, right? Only then did Guizhi squeeze out a sentence, smiling slightly: A healthy person, why are you talking about getting sick? After he finished speaking, he still lowered his head. Zhao Ziqiang said: That's what I say and what I do, but my father probably won't be happy about it. But apart from this method, wanting to resign is really not easy. Guizhi said: That's okay. He quickly snatched up these four words, but there was no follow-up. What does "that's okay" mean? Does it mean that it's okay if the old man isn't happy? Or does it mean that apart from this method, you can't resign? If that's the case, then you have to force a resignation! Therefore, Zhao Ziqiang just stared at Guizhi in a daze, unable to say anything more. Guizhi seemed to see his meaning, looked at him and smiled, and wanted to say something, but held it back. Zhao Ziqiang said: Didn't I say that I'm a clumsy person, I can't say what I want to say, please forgive me if anything happens. (184)</p>
<p>Little Knowledge</p>
<h3>Medicinal Effects of Seasonal Vegetables</h3>
<p>— Chu Yu</p>
<p>Nowadays, ordinary meals during the transition between summer and autumn, whether for the propertied or the propertyless class, generally include eggplants, pumpkins, winter melons, watermelons, cucumbers and other vegetables. However, we Chinese people, for any kind of food, only seek the goodness of taste and do not understand the function of various foods, so we see these vegetables as worthless. In fact, for many ailments we have, without spending a penny, we can get very effective medicine, especially in poor rural areas, when suffering from chronic diseases and unable to afford a doctor, we can make use of waste. Now I have a few secret prescriptions that I have invented to introduce to society, please test them one by one, and you will know that my words are true.</p>
<p>(Pumpkin) Chop very ripe pumpkin meat into pieces, dry it in the sun, grind it into a fine powder, which can cure tapeworm disease. Dosage: Take two or three qian with plain boiled water every day, and the tapeworm will come down from the stool. If you dry the pumpkin seeds in the sun (do not wash them with water), simmer them with rock sugar in soup, and take two or three qian every day, you can cure sore throats in children. Also, calcine the pumpkin's crown into ash and swallow two or three qian with plain boiled water every day, which has the effect of resolving phlegm, even greater than the Banxia sold in the market.</p>
<p>(Cucumber) Collect very ripe cucumbers whose exterior has turned yellow-brown, peel off the skin, dig out the seeds, chop the meat into pieces, put them in a magnetic earthenware jar, seal it with paper to prevent air from escaping, and put it in a cool place. If you encounter burns or scalds, take out the rotten, smelly juice and apply it to the injured area, which can not only relieve pain, but also smooth and remove the scars of the wound. Also, collect the tender leaves of cucumbers and dry them in the hot sun, and decoct five or six qian with boiled water every day, which can cure urinary problems and beriberi.</p>
<p>(Watermelon) Generally, for people with leukorrhea, eating more watermelon is very effective. Also, squeeze out the watermelon juice and boil it to make watermelon rind candy, which can be used to treat kidney disease. If you dry the watermelon rind in the sun, decoct five qian with boiled water every day, you can cure edema-related diseases. Also, calcine the watermelon rind into ash, mix it with honey, and if a child suffers from oral sores, applying it is very effective.</p>
<p>(Loofah) Squeeze the juice of ripe and tender loofah, filter it with cloth to clarify it, or take the juice from its stems, which can be used as a cosmetic water. If children get prickly heat in summer, wiping it with this melon juice will immediately relieve it.</p>
<p>(Winter melon) Among vegetables, winter melon has the greatest medicinal effect. If you suffer from nephritis, pleurisy, peritonitis, beriberi and other diseases, it is very effective. If you accidentally eat fish or crab and get poisoned, decoct winter melon juice and take it to detoxify. Winter melon seeds can also cure appendicitis. The so-called 'intestinal decoction' in the past was made with winter melon seeds, moutan bark, peach kernel, and coix seed. (Corn) People with kidney disease, decoct corn with water every day to use as tea, which is both delicious and can treat the disease. If you decoct the corn silk (i.e. pistil) with water, it is also miraculously effective. If you decoct the roots and stems of corn, you can treat bladder stones.</p>
<p>(Eggplant) Eggplant is originally a poisonous plant. Usually, because it is boiled and harmonized with salt and vinegar, the toxic components are broken down. If you burn the eggplant into ash and calcine it, for people suffering from swollen and painful gums, rubbing it with ash is very effective. Also, squeeze out the eggplant juice and apply it to warts once or twice a day, which can also cure them. Also, dry the eggplant flowers in the shade, decoct them with boiling water, which can cure appendicitis and abdominal pain caused by parasites, etc. Decoction of eggplant stems and leaves, applied to frostbite, is more effective than any frostbite medicine.</p>

<p>Talking Points</p>
<h3>Talking About "Hope"</h3>
<p>— Zhi</p>
<p>It seems I once heard someone say that "hope" is the "lighthouse" of life. A person without "hope" is like a poor person groping in the dark: he has no light, no breath, and no strength! Because with "hope," there is a direction and action to pursue, and finally, the great, eternally indestructible "force" that creates everything is generated!</p>
<p>However, it also seems that some people say that China is the most hopeful and the most capable of "hoping" nation. Indeed, since "September 18th" when Japanese soldiers seized "Shenyang" in the time it took "Young Marshal Zhang" to watch a play, the Chinese people began to live in fervent and sincere "hope": hoping that the "League of Nations" would uphold justice, forcing Japan to return "the three northeastern provinces," so that they themselves would not have to fire a bullet or injure a soldier; hoping that "Soviet Russia" would send troops to "Manchuria" to poke the Japanese in the rear, so that the "Volunteer Army" could win victories in the "green gauze tents"; hoping that a "national hero" would be generous and enthusiastic, regarding death as homecoming, and lead 120,000 soldiers out of the customs to recover the lost land; hoping that the brave and divine "Broadsword Teams" could all "roll eighteen times on the spot" and roll into the enemy's line to chop off the enemy's heads and legs! They even hoped that heaven would open its eyes and the bodhisattvas would show their holiness, causing a major earthquake and a widespread plague in Japan! They also hoped that the "swordsmen" and "real people" in the fairy and martial arts novels who could "fly over walls and walk over roofs" and "spit swords and refine qi" would lead heavenly soldiers and generals to appear in the world and, with a "finger of the right hand," "kill" with "a ray of white light," followed by the heads of the dwarf soldiers and dwarf generals rolling all over the fields, the corpses filling the valleys, and the fresh blood flowing like ditches and like the Yellow River!</p>
<p>"January 28th" arrived. The XX Route Army won a victory, so the "hope" of the Chinese people became even greater! In addition to the previous pile of "hope" that of course had to be retained, many new "hopes" were produced: hoping that the XX Route Army would strike Yangshupu in one breath, hoping that the Japanese soldiers would retreat onto warships and escape outside Wusongkou, hoping to see "five enemy planes shot down" or "ten" in the newspaper every morning, even though we had no anti-aircraft guns;</p>
<p>hoping that the Hunan people would be willing to lend the road to Zhang XX, who was "begging to fight against Japan," to send troops to Shanghai to help, and also hoping that "Baichuan" and "Liuhe" would "die in battle," hoping that the firecrackers set off in the city that night were really because "our army" had "reached the Bund"! And hoping for reinforcements, hoping that the XX Route Army would come from Kunshan and Nanxiang like riding on clouds and fog, and unknowingly let our second-to-last team open the gate early in the morning to see the XX Route Army, all wearing straw sandals and bamboo hats! Even more hoping that Feng XX's 100,000 troops would descend from the sky when "Liuhe was attacked." Of course, there was also hope that the United States would lend a large number of cannons and bullets to me, that the Germans would come to fire the cannons for me, and that Guangdong would send dozens of planes to fight fiercely with the enemy in the sky. The war stopped, the contract was signed, hoping not to lose power or humiliate the country, hoping that the Japanese would compensate for all losses, and then hoping that everyone would sacrifice their family property, destroy their homes to help the country, and donate money to buy planes...</p>
<p>This chaotic, uncountably vast collection of "hope," of course, is also all "light," "breath," and "strength," only it is "unnecessary" to realize it. Because even though it is unnecessary [to realize it], our purpose is still achieved in the same way, this is the principle of having "heavenly assistance," "divine assistance," and "ghost assistance" in the dark, and this "heaven," "god," and "ghost" are bound to be forever with us "Chinese people"! So some people say: "The puppet state is not a problem. In fifty years, Japan will have to bow its head and obey China. What power can that kid Puyi have?" ...</p>
<p>It's true, "hope" is the "lighthouse" of life! With "hope," there is "light," there is "breath," and there is "strength"! But ah, poor people, if "hope" only turns into "expectation," then will it also emit dazzling "light," unstoppable "breath," and the great power that creates everything? For example, a slave "hopes" that his enslaver will have great compassion to save his life, but gives up the struggle himself. Is this "hope" likely to succeed? Isn't it turning into an eternal, unattainable empty wait? Therefore, if you want to be free, you can only engage with your own "power"! Because only in this way can you gain all sympathy. Expecting-style "hope" that others will help is foolish, self-deceiving, and worthless! Because even if people are willing to help, those who exert themselves to help have another purpose, at least, that is, to repeat and replace the position of a previous enslaver!</p>
<h3>Opening Ceremony</h3>
<p>— Li Li</p>
<p>"Dang! Dang! Dang!" The bell kept ringing, once twice...three in a group, five in a pile, quietly in the playground, the students in the classroom were swallowed into the door of the auditorium like fish, white shirts, black skirts, floral qipaos disappeared at the door, the lingering sound of the bell, buzzing, lingering, scattered in the silent air.</p>
<p>Black heads, high and short, unevenly moving:</p>
<p>Shiny wooden combs, floral ribbons, wavy curled beautiful hair, straight and loose long hair, short, downy, childlike hair...the wave of hair, moving with the movement of the head, constantly moving.</p>
<p>Singing the party song, saluting, reciting the Premier's will, silence. Standing, each black head lowered, long hair draped over the face, itchy, raising a hand to sweep back, the elbow touching the head next door, a hiss sound, embarrassed, apologizing with a low laugh. Again, quiet. Feet lightly drawing, one stroke to the left, one stroke to the right.</p>
<p>"Deng" - the leather shoes kissed the stool leg, black and shiny eyes shot over, rose-colored blush printed on the lowered cheeks. ...</p>
<p>The principal's report: "Students..." The gentle, slight, native-accented Mandarin came out of his mouth... Raising their heads, naively staring at the principal's mouth, listening intently (?) Lowering their heads, looking at their own feet, the students' feet, the teachers' feet, the principal's feet, as if trying to get something from these many different feet. The report is over, the suffocating silent air loosens a little, the wave of heads, the wave of hair move slightly once or twice. Reported! The shiny bald head swaying on the black long gown, the heavy, slow, old voice, incessantly talking, seemingly tireless, seemingly without end. Looking at the watch, five minutes, ten minutes, half past, still the same heavy, slow, old voice, incessantly talking. The floral handkerchief constantly swaying in the hand, sometimes letting go, sometimes folding well; wrapped around the fingers, one wrap to the left, one wrap to the right. Two heads leaning together, talking quietly, extremely faint, traveling-like laughter, coming out of the seam of the leaning heads. ...</p>
<p>The incessant sound, like a string broken - waking up as if from a dream, looking around blankly. Dismissal, a sound like an alarm bell aroused people's spirits. Too tired! Sitting for three whole hours.</p>
<p>White shirts, black skirts, floral qipaos, stirred again by the autumn wind, fluttering in the playground.</p>
<h3>Is it Really True that "Suffering" is Predestined?</h3>
<p>— Xiao Zhi</p>
<p>Early in the morning, Old Uncle Li, sitting upright at the back door with his copper-rimmed glasses, holding the old Shenbao and reading it word by word in a vague voice, met me coming out to relieve myself. He kept swaying his three-inch long, snow-white beard and shaking his head, extremely emotionally and as if he had seen through this wonderful world, stubbornly grabbing me and saying:</p>
<p>"The Chinese people must have committed some major sins in their previous lives, that's why the King of Hell sent us to the human world to suffer this layer of endless suffering, to endure this lifelong, inexhaustible torment; alas! The Chinese people's suffering is predestined from the previous life!"</p>
<p>I have never believed in "fate" and I most dislike hearing about "fate," and this old uncle was also vaguely talking about "previous lives," "sins," "King of Hell," and "human world." This made my head swell and I felt even more. I really hated him, but I had no choice but to perfunctorily answer him:</p>
<p>"Um... Uncle Li..."</p>
<p>At the same time, I unconsciously shifted my gaze to the newspaper held in his dry and trembling hand. I seemed to have discovered something, I couldn't help but question his "fate" judgment and cried out in shock:</p>
<p>"Ah! Look! Today's newspaper again has a big headline saying, 'The Yellow River in Western Shandong has overflowed, and two million people are about to drown' news!"</p>
<p>"That's right! The Chinese people committed sins in their previous lives, and not small ones! This is clear evidence that the King of Hell is calling us to suffer and endure hardships! Otherwise, why would the Water Dragon Essence be born two years ago, causing national floods, and the deaths of so many people were not enough? Last year, the Old Heavens sent the Star of Slaughter, the Japanese, down to earth to massacre the lives of those in Shanghai, followed by the autumn harvest harming the farmers, and not long ago Wuhan was plagued by floods, and now the Yellow River has breached its banks again, and as many as two million people are suffering? Other phenomena such as the unequal distribution of suffering and happiness in society, and those killed on the battlefield in recent decades, have become even more violent in the past two years, with innocent civilians in the war zone being dragged away to be bandits and killed! This is definitely not an ordinary thing, it must be that fate is predestined, and there is no way to escape."</p>
<p>He spoke so anxiously that he choked a little; his large, drooping black eyeballs stared under his wrinkled eyelids, and finally, he closed his eyes and sighed. I was silent for a while, and I retorted him in a humorous tone:</p>
<p>"Then, Uncle Li, the day before yesterday the newspaper said that the cannon on the warship fired, and the cannonball shot out from behind the cannon's ass, killing several soldiers. Does this mean that these wronged ghosts also had a predestined fate of suffering?"</p>
<p>"..." Uncle Li only nodded, his expression very solemn. But, I couldn't bear it any longer, and I also had the intention of awakening this numb, pitiful old man who was already halfway into the coffin. However, my words were extremely gentle and smooth, and extremely serious:</p>
<p>"Uncle Li, do you really believe that fate is predestined from a previous life? It's all the same principle, 'fate' is just the anesthetic used by ambitious people to deceive us weaklings! They use this life-taking anesthetic to allow us to calmly and obediently accept oppression and be slaughtered,</p>
<p>and they can also be at ease and happily and constantly use poisonous sticks to whip us, they know that we are believers in "fate theory," knowing that we, in addition to docile groaning and wailing, are at most too afraid to even struggle. But Uncle Li, people are always people, we should resolutely blot out the two words "fate" with thick ink, roll up our sleeves and use our own inherent strength to drive all obstacles behind us, and step on them hard with our heels..."</p>
<p>My words were not finished, his uncle seemed very tired, he yawned several times in a row, he interrupted my words, stubbornly saying:</p>
<p>"Idle talk idle talk! I've talked for several decades more than you, probably thinking more clearly than you, do you know that nothing in the world is not precisely determined by fate? "Fate" is the truest thing!"</p>
<p>"Then, Uncle Li, is the 'suffering fate' of the Chinese people really predestined..." I said...</p>

<h3>Ancient Temple</h3>
<p>— Bing</p>
<p>North of Shanghai, there is an ancient temple with crumbling walls and faint traces of bullets.</p>
<p>It is difficult to call it ancient, yet it does not display any divine power. Therefore, the nearby residents do not quite believe in it. When something happens, they prefer to go far away to other temples to pray. The incense smoke here has always been very sparse. During the Shanghai Battle, among the many temples, only this one was destroyed by artillery fire, which shows that the bodhisattvas inside the temple have no mighty power. It has been a year and a half since it was destroyed, and no one, neither devout women nor pious men, has come forward to advocate for its reconstruction. As a result, it remains a ruin with crumbling walls and faint traces of bullets.</p>
<p>"Although the temple is ancient, it does not display any divine power" has become a common saying among the residents of the surrounding area.</p>
<p>According to legend, this ancient temple has a restriction: young women are not allowed to enter. Therefore, when sincere women want to offer incense, ask about their fortune, or pray for children, they must ask middle-aged women who are past their prime to enter the temple and pray on their behalf. They themselves can only stand at the temple entrance, devoutly gazing at the statues of the gods inside, silently praying.</p>
<p>Why this is the case, the nearby residents are somewhat uncertain.</p>
<p>Only one night before the Shanghai Battle, the old monk Deshan in the temple, while performing a Qingjiao ritual for the noodle shop across the street owned by A Qiu, mentioned a little about it to the boss: "During the Revolution of 1911, a young woman went wild in the temple." As to how she went wild, the old monk did not elaborate. When A Qiu pressed him, the old monk cut him off, saying, "The ancient temple is no longer very divine. We are sincerely protecting the Way. Don't mention such things again."</p>
<p>This restriction has been passed down for more than twenty years, and indeed, no one dared to violate it lightly.</p>
<p>However, since the Shanghai Battle, the ancient temple has become a war ruin, and the old monk who maintained the restriction has disappeared without a trace. His life or death is unknown, and the restriction has become an unclosed opening. As a result, young women often enter to take a look, as if exploring a secret.</p>
<p>Soon after, a new monk arrived, claiming to have come from a famous mountain. However, he did not understand poetry or books, and he could barely speak his own name clearly. During the day, he went out, saying he was soliciting donations to rebuild the temple, but A Qiu said he had seen him begging in the concession.</p>
<p>The new monk was very amiable. During such scorching summer days, he did not refuse the many residents who came to the temple to sleep in the open at night. He only said, at first, that he found it somewhat inappropriate that many boys and girls were running around naked. However, he merely gave two such warnings: "This will not be allowed in the future, once the temple is rebuilt!"</p>
<p>One night, after a violent storm, the number of people sleeping in the open decreased. Only a couple of coolies were lying on the front steps of the main hall, and their two children beside them were also dressed in clothes and trousers, as well-behaved as two lazy cats asleep. Elsewhere, in a clean open space above, a middle-aged poor woman was also sleeping, her breasts exposed. Her husband had originally been sleeping with her, but he had rushed back to his own thatched hut before the storm to fix the leaks, and he had not returned since.</p>
<p>After the storm, heat rose from the ground, and the stars in the sky twinkled. The new monk, sleeping in the half-collapsed outhouse, felt an infinite sense of oppression and trouble. His Buddhist heart kept pounding. Although he kept fanning his palm with a black folding fan and chanting Amitabha, his heart could not calm down. Under the light waves of the stars, he vaguely glimpsed the breasts of the middle-aged poor woman. Suddenly, her snoring drew out a long breath, and his Buddhist heart flashed. He closed his eyes again and chanted Amitabha.</p>
<p>As a result, at daybreak, when the sky was already fish-belly white, many people surrounded the new monk in the clean open space above, scolding him and hitting him. He only chanted Amitabha.</p>
<p>"Even monks do this. No wonder the ancient temple has become like this today!" It was an old woman standing to the side, who had seen through the essence of Zen, muttering to herself.</p>

<h3>Lucky Child</h3>
<p>— Yin</p>
<p>After the school bell rang at four o'clock, I felt extremely lighthearted. Half of my burden was lifted. Although I still had to prepare for night school homework, my exhausted energy should have some comfortable and effective adjustment at this time. So I went alone to the grass field, took a basketball in my hand, and ran alone on the several-zhang-long grass field, playing with the ball. "Ah! How tiring! Playing basketball alone." Those watching me shouted like this, but I only felt it was interesting. I forgot all the troublesome and tiring things. Sweat was flowing, and I was panting, but I didn't feel anything. In my mind, I kept thinking: "Exercise is beneficial to health and indirectly beneficial to studies." After playing basketball for twenty minutes, I changed my approach. I stepped on the seesaw, stepping it successfully to a horizontal line. I stood in the middle point, swaying back and forth, feeling both danger and interest. Later, I went to play on the slide. Everything felt full of interest.</p>
<p>Ah! The joy of studying is endless! Mom said, "Studying can make you a knowledgeable person, and you can occupy an important position in society in the future, truly becoming a useful person for the country. But hope is endless, as long as you grasp reality and work hard in the present, the aspirations of the future are not difficult to achieve, and the happiness of the future can undoubtedly be obtained." I listened to Mom's words, and I couldn't help thinking: How lucky I am, in such a country where education is not widespread, to be able to receive secondary education! How fortunate this is! Yes, I am a lucky child, but there are still a large number of people outside the school gate. How should I treat them? There are many girls who are not powerless to study, but are actually victims trapped in the environment of old ethics. What about "Girls only need to know a few characters! It's enough to read ordinary letters and write daily accounts. Who wants girls to earn a living?" There is also "Going back and forth on the street every day is strangely eye-catching." We think that in these few words, we easily bury the happiness of our girls, letting them grope along the long, dark road. There are also poor children who are powerless to study. They look enviously at the lucky children carrying their schoolbags and going to school, but they themselves are relegated to the ranks of the rejected. They can only watch and drool, and eventually they become "illiterate" and "ignorant." There are too many who suffer like this. But what methods can I think of to save them? Who should be blamed for the lack of widespread education? But the fact is really confusing and contradictory. There are schools everywhere in some places, but the content is unimaginable, just like my previous article "Schools Stand Like Forests," it's terrible! What remedy do these schools that stand like forests provide for reality?···</p>

<p>Drama</p>
<h3>War and Peace (Act Two, Three, and Four) — Ling Xia</h3>
<p>Act Two: The Fleeing Crowd</p>
<p>Wounded Man: You ask if there are any young women in my family? Let me tell you. I only had a good son, but he died several years ago. He left behind a child, only six years old this year. That child is really obedient; everyone likes him. He spends all day at home, doing work together with us. But this time, when I returned from the front line, alas, his mother and son were not at home; they had gone to play at their grandmother's house. Actually, it wasn't playing, to be honest. It was just to beg for a simple meal. Now, I don't know what happened to them. I originally wanted to see them, but because I was rushing to flee with everyone, I didn't even get to see them. Alas! It's pitiful that the child has suffered so much with his mother in this life... I really love him, but I'm afraid I won't see him on this journey.</p>
<p>(Everyone is moved by what he said. There is silence for a minute. Then, the medic suddenly wakes everyone up as if from a dream.)</p>
<p>Medic: It's clear that this retreat has harmed a lot of ordinary people. (At this time, the door and windows are slowly filled with people, sometimes even standing inside.) And we retreated so quickly. I'm a medic, following the army to rescue wounded soldiers. On the night of the twelfth, around one o'clock in the morning, we retreated from Luan City to Gubei. At two o'clock in the afternoon on the thirteenth, an order came from above to immediately transport heavy items to the rear. By eight o'clock in the evening, I thought I could finally get a good night's sleep, but another order came to move out immediately, requiring us to retreat to Xugezhuang. In two days and one night, it was almost three hundred li. So those ordinary people were naturally in a state of utter confusion. As soon as they heard that the army was retreating, they panicked immediately, like ants on a hot pot, only knowing to blindly follow the army and run around. Humph, this station is packed with people; I'm afraid there are countless people crying on the road.</p>
<p>Madam: (Slowly moves from over there to her own seat) That old man is really pitiful. Having to suffer like this at such an old age.</p>
<p>Maid: So what can we do?</p>
<p>Miss A: What can we do is what we just said.</p>
<p>Orderly: (Shouting from outside as he enters)</p>
<p>Go, go, go! What are you doing standing here? There's nothing to see here! Go!</p>
<p>(The crowd doesn't move at first, but then, seeing him take out his gun, they scatter in fear. At this time, Miss B sits alone in a chair, silent.)</p>
<p>Young Master: (Sitting and shouting) De Fa! Come here.</p>
<p>I want to talk to you. (The orderly goes over.)</p>
<p>Medic: Well then, I'll go now. Miss, you should still take him to Beiping for treatment. It's okay on the road; I've already bandaged him well. (Exits)</p>
<p>Young Master: You and the driver take that old fellow to the stationmaster and ask him to find a doctor to try to give him treatment. Here's twenty dollars for their medical expenses.</p>
<p>Miss B: (Rushes over) What? You're not willing to take him to Beiping for treatment? What does this mean!</p>
<p>Miss A: Look, here she comes again, going crazy again.</p>
<p>Miss B: I'm going crazy? You're the one who's going crazy. You injured him; aren't you even going to get him treatment?</p>
<p>Young Master: We are getting him treatment. Going to Beiping is treatment, and getting treatment here is treatment. Why isn't it treatment?</p>
<p>Miss B: Getting treatment here? How can you even say that? What hospitals are there here? Is twenty dollars enough to cover the medical expenses?</p>
<p>Who are you fooling? And he originally wanted to flee to Beiping, but now you're giving him treatment here and not allowing him to go. What does this mean?</p>
<p>Auntie: Second Miss, I don't think you need to get so angry. He's not someone you know. Why are you so concerned about him? If you really take him to Beiping,</p>
<p>Dad will scold you.</p>
<p>Miss B: What are you afraid of? We injured him and only gave him twenty dollars to be done with it. How can we live with our conscience?</p>
<p>Young Master: Ah, what conscience are you talking about? We should do it this way. It can't be wrong. What do you young girls know?</p>

<p>Film Special</p>
<h3>The Meaning of "Wilderness Films"</h3>
<p>— Mi Er</p>
<p>Films that take "virgin land" or backward ethnic groups as their subject matter or background are generally called "wilderness films."</p>
<p>Everyone knows that European and American film circles (especially the United States) are very enthusiastic about the production of wilderness films. To understand the reason for this, we must first understand the meaning of wilderness films, so that we can know that all the crises of capitalism have begun. Commodity surpluses, falling prices, and all capitalist countries are caught in a frenzy of recession. The reason is that the market is shrinking, and the purchasing power of the people is rapidly decreasing due to excessive exploitation. At this time, they (capitalist countries) have already entered the highest form | imperialism. They know that to reduce this crisis, there is only one way: to have another shameless, thieving war to redistribute and compete for colonial markets. Because there will be no more "virgin lands" in the world. Their attempt is reflected in films:</p>
<p>First, the promotion of war films, beautifying war to incite the people's interest in war and organize the people's war consciousness.</p>
<p>Second, the production of wilderness films, introducing colonies to the people, exaggerating the wealth of the colonies as much as possible, and describing the stupidity of the "natives" as much as possible, even using shameless, arbitrary propaganda such as "only white people can rule Africa" or "ruling colonies is to civilize the natives" to order the "people" to dream of developing colonies.</p>
<p>This is the current active meaning of general wilderness films. The most important aspect of the passive side is that sensitive filmmakers intentionally or unintentionally feel their own decline, and at the same time, they have no way to save themselves. They have no choice but to have the illusions of "escaping emptiness" and "returning to nature." They long for "primitive" life, so "Jane" in "Tarzan the Ape Man" enters the mountains with "Tarzan."</p>
<p>As for China, everyone knows that it is the largest market in the world, the people's livelihood of all imperialist countries. To exaggerate a bit, their economic situation changes with the purchasing of the Chinese people. Didn't Roosevelt say publicly that to revive the world economy, it is necessary to increase the purchasing power of the Chinese people? But the purchasing power of the Chinese people is not only not increasing because of their constant exploitation, but also greatly decreasing. This not only worries the imperialists, but also worries their pawns and lackeys. So they wanted to develop backward ethnic groups within China. So film once again became the vanguard!</p>
<p>Here, I am sure someone will stand up and retort, "Should we not film about the Yao and Miao people?" No, filming about the Yao and Miao people is absolutely necessary, but we should never ignore their real lives and urgent needs (liberation movements, etc.), and fabricate what "love stories" or "unofficial histories," etc. Not long ago, didn't we see news in the newspapers about an uprising of 150,000 Yao people? Although the newspapers said they were "Yao bandits," we know that they were resisting because they were oppressed, which is certain. So, isn't such a great subject worthy of our filming? "Asia's Clouds" has already been placed before us. Anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism are the truly good films that take backward ethnic groups as their subject matter!</p>
<p>Film Reviews</p>
<h3>Review of "Desperate"</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>After watching this film, I just want to write down some opinions in principle.</p>
<p>Since the loss of Northeast China, it has undoubtedly aroused the resentment of the general petty bourgeoisie in China. The majority of people, awakened to their own way out in the sound of artillery fire, because they realized the reason why China was being invaded, were organized and engaged in a thorough anti-imperialist movement, actively embarking on the road to national war. But on the other hand, the unawakened masses, although they hated the atrocities of the Japanese army and eagerly demanded the recovery of lost territory, often confined themselves to a narrow national concept, so all they could do was a patriotic movement. What they showed was, on the one hand, boycotting enemy goods and, on the other hand, sacrificing themselves for the country.</p>
<p>Now, these two concepts are constantly fighting. We can also see two different divisions in film works. Liu Chunshan's "Desperate" naturally belongs to the latter. We can see in this work that he is full of indignation. He pays attention to the unemployment problem. He knows that China's only way out is to resist with force. He hates the treacherous merchants who sell enemy goods, and he hates the cruel oppression of the rich, but his understanding is wrong. In his narrow concept, there are many illusions. For example, he thinks that a rich woman is willing to abandon her status and fall in love with a petty thug, and that only overseas Chinese are enthusiastic about donating money to support the volunteer army. Therefore, based on his conscientious patriotic advocacy, on the one hand, he boycotted enemy goods, and on the other hand, he vigorously promoted domestic goods. Here, we do not deny the fact of the enemy's economic aggression, but we believe that conscientious patriotism is by no means an effective method. Moreover, Chinese national capital can never grow under the iron hooves of the great powers, although the great powers also hope that China can move from feudalism to capitalism and contradictoryly support the development of Chinese capital in a very small range. Therefore, we hope that the author can recognize this major premise and not be confined to the concept of patriotism and be caught in the trap of the oppressors. Otherwise, the author will eventually have no way out, and even affect the audience to fall into a dead end.</p>
<p>As for the technical aspects, we don't need to point out every small mistake, and we can only correct some in principle.</p>
<p>First, the author does not understand the basic structure of comedy. So, if this is assumed to be a slapstick comedy, then it is a fundamental failure.</p>
<p>Second, in terms of content, this should be performed in a slapstick style.</p>
<p>Third, the protagonist should not be forcibly written as a hero.</p>
<p>In this way, its childish and vulgar achievements are naturally inevitable. Therefore, when we see that the treacherous merchant has a bizarre eye-rolling disease, which is cured with one medicine, and that Japanese Ajinomoto is used to treat hemorrhoids, etc., we can't help but sigh. Other things, such as the illegality of Montage and all the impure techniques, are all things that we hope the author will work harder on.</p>
<p>So our conclusion is: "The activism of the petty bourgeoisie is fully expressed in this film, but the performance is too disappointing."</p>
<h3>Wastepaper Basket</h3>
<p>— Bu Min</p>
<p>It is certainly unfortunate for manuscripts to go into the wastepaper basket, but as for the editors, there will never be an act of "disregarding life." This is a statement that the editors want to make to the readers and writers who care about this publication. Manuscripts with incoherent language, lack of substance, and excessive publicity are in danger of being thrown into the wastepaper basket at any time. As for usable manuscripts that cannot be published due to a lack of space, apart from those that are attached with self-addressed stamped envelopes that are returned at any time, they also have to be placed on the desk, waiting for the opportunity to be published. But if the timeliness is lost, they can only go into the wastepaper basket. Today, two manuscripts have also suffered the fate of being thrown into the wastepaper basket: one is Yi Hua's correspondence, concerning the filming of an airplane film in Hangzhou, a clearly usable manuscript, but a publicity department's blue-black stamp of more than two square inches was stamped in the middle of the text. Many words could not be seen. It was impossible to revise, and it was impossible to typeset. It's like an employee in the post office, clearly a scenic postcard sent from overseas, who stamps the postmark on the picture (spoiling the scenery) instead of stamping it elsewhere. Clearly, there is a lot of empty space on the back of the manuscript, but they don't stamp there and want to stamp on the words. It equally represents the bad habit of not cherishing things in China, so I decided not to use it and threw it into the wastepaper basket. Probably readers will not see my method as arbitrary. There is also a manuscript from Ge Zhuo, concerning the Yue Ming Film Company's "Bad Neighbor." This is a manuscript written by Ge Zhuo after watching the screening of "Bad Neighbor." Because there are many malpractices in publishing all kinds of previews, announcements, and introductions, I must wait until a film is publicly released and get an accurate review, and then consider publishing some audience opinions. I think this is a fair method, so Ge Zhuo's manuscript also went into the wastepaper basket. Yesterday, there were also several manuscripts, one written horizontally in the style of crab writing, one written on both sides, and one written in pencil, all of which were thrown into the wastepaper basket. Chinese characters are traditionally written from right to left, from top to bottom. Horizontal writing or writing on both sides is detrimental to typesetting work, so they are all rejected. As for pencil writing, once it reaches the inky hands of the typesetters, it becomes a mess, unable to distinguish black from white. I think it's better to keep some black and white.</p>
<h3>Audience Opinions</h3>
<p>— Bu Min</p>
<p>Editor's Note: "Golden Mountain" is a foreign film, but it is not produced by "a country that takes the money we pay for films that insult our Chinese nation." Moreover, it has many lessons for us. What I have heard from people's mouths are all good comments, so I broke the rule and revealed some of the audience's opinions.</p>
<h3>Talking about "Golden Mountain"</h3>
<p>— Yao Yinzong</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the new Soviet film "Golden Mountain," which is currently being screened, is the same as "Raw Road" in that it is an expression of "force," and the "force" of "Golden Mountain" is even stronger than that of "Raw Road." Like "Raw Road," it lacks soft seductiveness; all it has is strong excitement. It is impossible to satisfy the young masters of the leisure class; it can only give them a boring and dull feeling!</p>
<p>Its structural form is similar to "Asia's Clouds" in that both have "resistance" as their central idea: the difference is in the content. "Asia's Clouds" takes "nation" as its position, while "Golden Mountain" takes "class" as its position; the target of "Asia's Clouds" is "imperialism," while the target of "Golden Mountain" is "the bourgeoisie."</p>
<p>"Golden Mountain" exposes the greed, tyranny, and deception of the oppressed class | the bourgeoisie toward the oppressed class | the proletariat very vividly.</p>
<p>As for the performance, it is certainly very successful. Each actor is not a novice in film techniques, especially the two actors who played the worker Peter and the foreman, who have great attainments in film techniques. The pitiful coolie and the foreman who is loyal to the factory owner but insidious and cunning to the workers are both portrayed vividly thanks to the efforts of these two actors. The director's technique is very flexible, and he has put a lot of effort into the arrangement of the scenes. There are several places in it that are not found in the films of other capitalist countries, which can be regarded as the creation of the Soviet film industry.</p>
<h3>Kissing on the Silver Screen</h3>
<p>— Dong Lin</p>
<p>Young people who have watched foreign films think that foreign stars can hug beautiful women and kiss them, and that they are so lucky! In fact, they don't know the illusion of it!</p>
<p>Everyone knows that Clark Gable has kissed many times on the screen! But when you hear about his painful experience with kissing, you can't help but be surprised.</p>
<p>He said: "Up to now, I have filmed kissing scenes with more than fifty actresses. But these are all just fake! If you don't believe me, although you are hugging and kissing in the film studio, you are strangers with no relationship once you leave the film studio! I don't know if it's because the director doesn't allow me to, but I probably slip away when my lips are a third of an inch close, but this requires a lot of hard practice to make it look real. But if you use a microscope to magnify it hundreds of times, then it's not right. To be honest, only the stars know!"</p>
<p>Movie Novels</p>
<h3>Full River Red (V)</h3>
<p>— Qian Bai</p>
<p>Oh Heavens! Erxiang was only Xinye's lover; he was merely painting a portrait for her. How could it inexplicably ruin the love between him and Taozhi! Yet, she indirectly bought the painting and endured the pain of marrying Youguang. How great was her painstaking effort, her sacrifice! Her small heart will forever bear this indelible scar; how heartbroken she must be! Decided, Shuicun decided to rush to Shanghai to explain to her. He had misunderstood her before, and she came to explain to him time and time again. Now that she has misunderstood him, how could he not go and explain? But in this vast Shanghai, where could he find the tiny Taozhi? Taozhi and Youguang held their wedding. Although he saw it, he didn't have the courage to rush up and explain to Taozhi. He really didn't know what to do. Suddenly, a well-dressed middle-aged woman, leading two children, squeezed through the crowd into the auditorium and pointed at Youguang, saying angrily, "Good! You dare to get married again? What about me and the children?" This was truly a killjoy, but Youguang obediently followed the woman and children away. How heartbroken was Taozhi after this terrible change? Besides crying, what else could she do? Shuicun felt very sympathetic and sorrowful for her, but he was unwilling to miss this opportunity to explain. Shuicun explained to her; Taozhi accepted his explanation. Shuicun also told her that he was going to Hankou.</p>
<p>"Why do you suddenly want to go to Hankou?"</p>
<p>"Because in these few days, I have realized that 'love' is a game played by people with money and leisure. We poor fellows should transfer the passion and energy of love to the environment where the powerful cannot eat, and struggle for our own livelihoods!" "…"</p>
<p>Taozhi had a deep understanding of Shuicun, so before Shuicun left, she felt that she should at least see Shuicun once and talk to him again. But when she rushed to the ship, Shuicun was already dead drunk. The ship was about to depart, but under such circumstances, how could Taozhi be willing to go ashore alone and leave Shuicun to go away drunk?</p>
<p>"Fire! Fire!"</p>
<p>In the dead of night, suddenly, people became noisy. Men and women, old and young, rushed to the deck one after another, scrambling to be the first. Why? Ah! It turned out that the cargo ship had been careless, and the fire was already out of control. Taozhi called out to Shuicun, but he did not wake up for a long time. How could Taozhi abandon Shuicun and run away alone? This really worried Taozhi! In an instant, the red light filled the river surface. It seemed that neither Shuicun nor Taozhi had escaped the encirclement of the red light. (The End)</p>
