<p>（一）一俟環境許可、必須立即重建國際貨幣之本位、至此項本位自必黄金無疑、但未曾發表所擬之基礎、</p>
<p>（二）跌落已久之物價、必須使之回漲、</p>
<p>（三）必須以建設的努力、祛除目下阻碍貿易之限制、如高關稅與禁止進口及進口歲額等、</p>
<p>（四）必須由數國中央銀行聯合行動、以擴充放欵、而此項放欵必須使之流動而不滯留、</p>
<p>此外討論之問題尙多、如改善白銀在貨幣上之地位、亦其一端、但此等問題、公報人未曾提及有可切實建議、聞將俟倫敦會議時續加討論、目下英專家則暫留美京專事完成兩執政所交付之未了事件、據稱、白銀亦爲其中之一、而今後黄金之價值與白銀之地位、將爲英美專家再在美京繼續會議數日中之主要問題、蓋各專家除企圖商定一各國咸可接受之貨幣本位外、尙欲覓致一國際匯兌計劃、俾各國可以大紓其匯兌之管理、因兩國專家咸認外匯之自由流通、乃興復經濟所必要、但欲覓致可以担保自由流通之完善方法、則亦一不易解决之問題也、按英美執政之談話及所發之公報、雖有減紓美人對於經濟狀况所抱焦慮之趨向、惟因未有正式同意點發表、美國人民仍頗覺失望、蓋當局雖於談話開始時聲明此番端在探試途徑、而大部份人民仍盼望對於戰債及國際金本位有坦然之同意也、今日白宮方面因此鄭重聲稱、美國獲得英國之合作後、業已奠置一完善之基礎、可期將來倫敦會議偉大之成就、但亦聲明美國對於倫敦會議之進行上、　謀致友誼之諒解外、不圖與他國有所聯盟云云、至美國報紙幾一致贊助總統與英相之努力解决所談各問題、本日評論多謂即令將來各項提議中僅有一項能在倫敦會議獲得完全成功、而此日之談話、亦已有不可計量之價値、又謂關於貨幣本位之會議、前已舉行多次、迄未能得永久之結果、目前之會議又有一成就非常事業之機會、因若輩赴會時已早知將有數國不得不作若干犧牲、苟欲轉變形勢、則美國亦必須有所犧牲、（二十六日國民電）</p>

<p>在非常時期即應有非常時期之敎育我國今日則已臨非常時期矣在此時期全國各級敎育即都應改弦更張在訓育方面應以民族意識之喚起與帝國主義之認識爲主體在學識方面則應以關於戰爭之各種實用科學爲主體以（民族革命戰爭）一口號發動全國靑年學生爲維護民族生存作奮死抗爭之準備彼日帝國主義者早已實施軍國民敎育矣今日亦已準備全國靑年總動員矣若我國今日而仍一如平時學者學其所學敎者敎其所敎或且囿於（洋八股）之範疇不顧實際之需要則此種敎育在今後所收獲之果更可知矣。</p>
<p>就當前之事實言吾人則絶不能承認九一八以後之敎育較之九一八以前有若何之區别曾接受九一八沉痛之敎訓而有若何之改進其尤可痛者今日一般人仍如從前或視靑年爲工具或視靑年爲可怖之洪水猛獸視爲工具者則處處存利用之心理視爲洪水猛獸者則又時時存戒心於是而學生乃漸趨於銷沉之路或轉入政客之流其稍有熱血者則左右皆錯啼笑皆非甚且目擊時艱而願以靑年爲友者亦罔不横遭铺忌視爲别有作用别有企圖再就敎育界之本身而言亦復各立門户各不相謀鮮有肯一計及其當前所應負荷之責任創傷遍體而不自覺大難臨頭而不動心此則吾人在今日所堪悲痛而最應深思者也。</p>
<p>靑年爲國家之命脈而敎育又爲立國之根本我民族之前途如何視今日之敎育即可預斷曩昔之敎育旣認爲已收得若干之惡果矣則今日又將如何我國凡百之病態爲麻木不仁敎育界之麻木尤爲百病之根我全國敎育界諸君子於此亟應三思。</p>

<p>交部與中國自動電話公司、訂購自動機料合同後、復於十九年五月、與該公司訂立建築閘北浦東兩局屋合同、是年四月、該公司開始將自動機件材料、分批運滬、九月起、南市總局着手裝置、二十年、閘北浦東局屋建築工竣、是年十二月、南市閘北之自動機、均已裝妥、第以自動電話不獨内部機件、須屬優良、而局外綫路、亦須完善、交部有鑒於此、特飭上海電話局、在南市區内建造地下管道一千六百六十公呎、閘北區内建設地下管道三千五百二十公呎、並添設架空電纜、縮短明綫、以冀减少障碍、此項工程、最費時間、詎意各項工程、正值告竣之際、而一二八戰事驟起、閘北分局自動機及綫路工程、均遭燬損、而該處料棧存儲之地纜、以及桿料等項、悉化灰燼、工程進行、大感困難、不得已將南市浦東之材料、運往補充、逐項修理、始得於四月上旬、勉强告成、此三年來之經過情形也、</p>
<h3 id="c151">訂購話機 <a href="#c151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>南市閘北之自動機、旣經告成、而局外綫路亦經竣工、交部爲滬市民衆便利早日通話起見、迭經令飭該局、迅將南市閘北兩區、緊工作、籌備通話、故該局於數日間、内外趕工、始得於四月十五日開放通話、惟浦東分局内部之自動機件、雖亦奘竣、但局外綫料、以大半移用於南市閘北兩處、不及補充、故不能同時通話、現正由交部設法訂購、一俟運到、卽令該局開始工作、不久亦可完竣、</p>

<p>上海爲通商巨埠、租界堪稱重心、該局用户中之通租界電話者、十居七八、故華租兩界之通話、實爲最大問題、該局與上海電話公司原有出人中繼線各二十四對、連長途中繼線六對、一併在内、自動通話後、出入中繼線、增至各三十對、並將各方之入中繼線直接至自動機、不經同台轉接之麻煩、俾雙方改善而以南市總局之長途台移　閘北新局、另設中繼線八對、故對於民衆之通話、得較前爲敏捷該局曾向上海電話公司、要求繼續增加中繼線之設備、並取消三分鐘之限制、及大洋五分之收費辦法、該公司以損失較大、設備不敷、未能同意、將來倘能成功、則民衆方面通話尤爲便利、</p>

<p>該局訂購自動機、資本支絀浩繁、且金價賤漲、倍增於昔、而中繼線之年租、復由五十兩增至二百兩、益以長途及華租兩界之通話、仍須經話務員之接線、故各項維持費用、繼長增高、實有人不敷出之虞、且自動機開始通話後、按照合同、每月須付與中國自動電話公司奬金四千元、約合華幣兩萬元、支出驟增、爰將電話酌予加價、聊資挹注、惟以滬市一二八後、商業凋敝、交部爲體恤市民起見、特將該局自動機月租較首都減輕一元、其未裝自動機之龍華江灣眞茹吴淞等處、仍照舊章辦理、以經市民負擔、</p>

<p>一二八事變的當兒，上海的影戲院當眞停了若干日的市。後來「床上恊定」旣經簽字，於是乎「救國不忘娱樂」，｜或是「娱樂不忘救國」，影戲院也就恢復了舊有的繁榮。</p>
<p>然而專以「玉腿酥脚」爲號召的影片頗受人抨擊了！因爲這些荒淫肉感的片子能夠消磨抗日救國的壯志。</p>
<p>同時，武俠迷信的影片也受人抨擊了！因爲這些封建思想的片子能夠麻醉人心。</p>
<p>同時，電影之爲民衆敎育的利器云云，也更加喊得響亮。一時大家都要求著發揚民族精神的影片，提倡國貨的影片，或是什麽提倡努力生產的影片了。影片公司也忙着轉換方向。雖則姗姗其來遲，但在一二八週年以後，我們到底看見了「狂流」和「城市之夜」「三個摩登女性」這一些嶄新的片子了。聽說這些片子確能和舶來品的「玉腿酥胸」鬥一鬥。可是眼前我們在「抗日戰爭」呀，民衆應該抱「抵抗到底」的决心，民衆應該明　前線的將士怎樣「浴血苦戰」而趕快踴躍輸將呀，那自然只有了「狂流」等等還嫌不夠！那自然必須編製幾部「抗日戰爭」影片才行！</p>
<p>這是上下一致的要求！而且在上者已在籌備。</p>
<p>不過「抗日戰爭」我們看見過好幾幕了。其中最難忘的，是湯玉麟將軍的逃走。這不是能夠「提神」的節目，想來是不會被採用的。那麽採用的，光景是喜峯口的勝利，大刀隊的神勇，而題了「還我河山」那樣雄壯的名兒。這樣，民衆看了，旣知道確已「抗」過，而且不忘「還我」，自然感戴之至！</p>
<p>這是在「玉腿酥胸」和「武俠迷信」以外另闢蹊徑，足可使才百姓放下一百二十四個心，醉迷迷地等待「長期抵抗」的最後勝利！</p>

<p>— 楊幸之</p>
<p>丨答曹聚仁先生</p>
<p>前兩天，我在本刋上發表了「回農村去與吃肉糜」一文。這篇文章的主要用意是在於指明回農村去創造「世外桃源」一主張不僅是一個Ｕｔｏｐｉａ的幻夢，而且恰是一顆含有濃厚的麻醉性與欺騙性的烟幕彈。因爲它巧妙地在大衆的腦子裏安下一個美麗的希望，它拉着大衆逃避現實，它把大衆的目標轉移到另一個幻覺上去。這樣回農村去的主張，我們當然是應該「堅决反對。」</p>
<p>不過，因爲篇幅的關係，在前文中，我的話只說了一半。實在，我也是主張回農村去的，因爲在都市裏失業無法生活的人們，旣没有Ａ宇消毒牛奶可吃，又没有喝喝酒，打打麻將，塡塡「解放詞，的可能」國家事可以「管他娘，」自己的事却不容管他娘，要「管，」便得回農村去，農村裏正有許多事在等待着我們動手，而且有許多伙伴在向我們招手，自然應該回農村找「生路」去，老擠在都市裏只是等死，只是「逃避。」這一層意思，我正打算另寫一文，以補充前文未盡之意，恰好曹聚仁先生先來了一個「褊袒回農村去」的主張，對於我前日一文表示「異議。」這一異議，我認爲是非常有意義的。</p>
<p>然而我對於曹先生的異議却仍不能滿意，相反的，我還是要表示「堅决的反對。」因爲曹先生的回農村的主張，只是爲前一主張做了一個新的註脚，所犯的錯誤也是和前者毫無二樣，而且這樣的「改善論，」在作用上，也許比前者更爲毒辣。無論曹先生這樣的主張是否出於「意識的，」但所造成的錯誤結果則是一樣。</p>
<p>爲什麽呢？第一曹先生把當前的中國農村分做甲，乙，兩三種，而且認爲回丙種農村去，「絶對不會失望，」這便是一個絶大的錯誤。因爲他旣硬將「整個」資本主義世界，「整個」殖民地，整個處於崩潰過程中的農村分割不成相聯繫的似乎可以「獨立存在」的三種地域，而又忽視了當前農村崩潰的緣因與其趨勢。他似乎認爲錢塘江上流那一塊土，便是「没有剝削關係」「不受政治經濟影響」而又「永遠不會崩潰」的「福地，」可以收容一切的失業者，可以建設一個自耕農的「王國，」可是事實上是不是這樣呢？這是曹先生的錯誤一。</p>
<p>第二，曹先生似乎認定「自耕農經濟」是土地問題的最理想的解决，是農民問題的最美滿的歸宿，這種「認定」恐怕也免不了是一個嚴重錯誤，而且他把許多農業無產者屏出圈外，主張單獨「組織自耕農作自衛戰，」以反抗資本主義經濟之侵蝕，以反抗貪污土劣之吸吮，來維護這一塊「福地，」這尤其是大錯而特錯。還有，曹先生的自衛方式是「帮助自耕農，組成强有力的國體以集體農　來實現農業電氣化，使自耕農能保持自己的土地自己的器械。」就在這寥寥數語中，有計劃，有組織，有鬭爭，有工業革命，有農業革命，也許還有一個獨立的政權，偉大則偉大矣，然而這一偉大的工程是不是錢塘江上流那一塊土的幾千或者萬「自耕農」所能負荷的呢？這是曹先生的錯誤二。</p>
<p>第三，曹先生說：「且看消費合作社在蘇聯革命進程中所盡的力，」不錯，銷費合作社對於蘇聯革命｜不，對於蘇聯底社會主義經濟的建設過程，確是起了相當的作用，然而那只是在「蘇聯」呵，橘，逾淮則會成爲枳，五年計劃並不是任何一國都可以實行的呵！這是曹先生的錯誤三。</p>
<p>有此三點錯誤，所以曹先生的「異議，」還只是一顆烟幕彈，一個幻覺。</p>
<p>然而最後我還是主張「回農村去，」因爲農村裏有許多伙伴在向我們招手，有許多事等待着我們開始幹。</p>
<h3 id="c206">苦笑呻吟與呼號 <a href="#c206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— 巴金</p>
<p>丨給我的哥哥丨（續）</p>
<p>你回到北方去了。這八年來我們聚在一起總共不上一個月。如今我要開始我的漂泊的生活。在我的希望裏似乎就再没有我們安靜地聚在一起的時間。昨天晚上在一個朋友的家裏我曾經對你說過：我要找一個機會把我這個年青的生命拿來作孤注一擲。我想做一件痛快的事情，甚至就毁滅掉我的全個生活也不顧惜。當時你没有說什麽，你不過微微一笑。</p>
<p>這情形你也許不會了解罷。「爲什麽應該捨棄那寫作生活呢」？在你的思想裏這問題是得不着解答的。但是事實上你知道我整整有三個月不曾動筆寫什麽了。我寗願把時間花費在馬路上，火車中，和朋友的家裏來消磨我的年靑的生命。但是我所希望的機會終於連影兒也不見，而外面却有人放暗箭似地在文章上說，我已經在自嘆我的筆快要寫完了。</p>
<p>自然，你是不會相信這種謠言的。我們在一起度過了將近二十年的生活，你知道我是以一個怎樣忠實的心經歷過這一切的。我的信仰；我的爲人你都知道得很詳細，我從没有寫完過我所想寫的東西，我也從没有過一個時候讓霧迷了我的眼睛，我到現在還活着，不曾躺下來，然而人家却拿種種的謠言來掩埋我了。對於這些謠言，我並不曾發出過一聲抗議。我只有苦笑，我只有呻吟。</p>
<p>這呻吟，這苦笑，在我的肩上堆積眘，兩年來牠們就堆積了這麽高，如今在我的身後就留了一個那麽長的陰影了。我漸漸地憎恨我的名字起來。起初我說我愛我的文章，然而到現在在我的文章被人糟塌够了以後，我也就憎恨我的文章了。我如今依舊在黑暗裏掙扎，眼睛望着前面達不到的遠處的光明，而我的文章差不多要窒息了我的呼吸，我的名字差不多要毁滅了我的信仰，我的爲人。今天我不能夠再苦笑了；我不能够再呻吟了。我說這一切都應該終止了。</p>
<p>當初我獻身寫作的時候，我充滿着信仰，我充滿着希望。我把寫作當作我的生活的一部分，我以忠實的態度來走我在寫作中所走的路徑。我抱定决心：我不做一個文人。你知道我素來就憎厭文人的。我們常常說將來不要做一個文人，因爲文人不是直接做一個掠奪者，就是做掠奪者的一個工具。在小孩時代我們就見慣了文人的醜態了。誰知道殘酷的命運竟然使我自己今天也被人家當作文人來看待，而且把我們所憎厭的一切都加到我的身上了。造謠，利用，玩弄，攻擊，捧塲，這兩年來牠們包圍着我，把我圍得那麽緊，使我不能夠呼吸一口自由的空氣。有一個時候我甚至疑惑我馬上就要進墳墓了。</p>
<p>在這種情形下面我寫出了我的「靈魂的呼號」。那文章是去年秋天我們在天津相會時，我在你的同事的那間小屋裏寫成的。牠在上海某雜誌上發表以後，一個未見面的朋友讀着竟流了憐憫的眼淚，他說料不到我的生活竟是如此痛苦的。</p>
<p>在那文章裏我說過我要把文學生活結束了。可是我從北方回來，我的生活就陷落在更多的造謠，利用，玩弄，攻擊，捧塲裏面。這些侮辱伴着病把我壓得不能够動彈。我在病床上躺了好幾天，我想到我未寫小說以前的生活，我想到我在生活裏所私淑的幾個先生，我的心就被悔恨折磨着。一個聲音在我的耳邊響了起來；「你能夠再像這樣生活下去了。你應該站起來做一個勇敢的人！」</p>
<p>不錯，我太懦弱了！作爲一個「寫作的人」的我，確實是太懦弱了！這兩年來我讓一切侮辱加到我的身上，我從不曾發出過一聲抗議。我苦笑呻吟的次數確實是太多了。我懷着一個孩子似的幼稚的心旅行了所謂中國的文壇，我相信着一切的人，我愛着一切的朋友。於是種種使我苦笑呻吟的事情就發生了：「未完」</p>

<p>「啊！啊！這糟了！」他說。</p>
<p>他剛才以爲安然過去了。他的運氣未免太好。他昨晚實在不應當偷懶的。現在眞的處罰快要到來了。</p>
<p>他坐在床上凝想着。房門已經從外面用鑰匙鎖上了。窗户上嵌有鐵條。出去是不可的。然而他仍舊起來摸一摸門和窗上的鐵條。他匍匐在地上，用手在床底下划着，找尋他自己明明知道没有的尿鉢。</p>
<p>他睡下又爬起。他寗願動着，走着，頓着脚，却不願睡下；他把兩個拳頭揉着他那膨脹的肚子。</p>
<p>「媽媽！媽媽！」他柔弱地呌着，唯恐别人聽到。因爲如果雷辟克家的跑來了，他便會馬上一點事情都没有而顯得是故意和她開玩笑似的。他這樣呌呌，不過是爲得明天好問心無愧地說他曾呌過她罷了。</p>
<p>並且他怎能用力呌喊呢？他所有的力氣都用在使得那災禍慢一點發生一事上。</p>
<p>不一會兒，一種非常利害的痛楚使得紅蘿蔔鬚舞蹈起來。他緊靠着牆壁又跳開來。他緊靠親床欄。他緊靠着椅子，他緊靠着壁爐，他把壁爐前面的鐵板猛烈地拉開，他蹲下去，戀作一團，他降服了，他頓時快樂極了。</p>
<p>房裏面黑得更利害。</p>
<p>尿鉢（三）</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚直到黎明才再睡着，早上雷辟克家的好像在外面就聞着了什麽似的，推開門做着怪臉進來時，他還没有起來。</p>
<p>「多奇怪的味道！」她說。</p>
<p>「早啊，媽媽！」紅蘿蔔鬚說。</p>
<p>雷辟克家的把被單扯下，滿房嗅著，只一會便尋出來了。</p>
<p>「昨晚我身體不舒服，而房裏又没有尿鉢，」紅蘿蔔鬚連忙說，他以爲這是他最好的辯解的法子。</p>
<p>「扯謊的東西啊·扯謊的東西啊！」雷辟克家的說。</p>
<p>她跑出去，偷偷地拿着一隻尿鉢進來，敏捷地塞在床底下，她把紅蘿鬚拖起來，把一家人都喊了來，呌說道：</p>
<p>「我究竟造了什麽孽，會有一個這樣的孩子呀？」</p>
<p>她時而拿來一些抹布，一桶水，好像救火一樣，把一個壁爐全給水淹了，她　着舖蓋，呌人放空氣進來！放空氣進來！忙亂着，怨詈着。</p>
<p>她時而在紅蘿葡鬚的鼻頭指手劃脚地說：</p>
<p>「該死的東西！你難道失了知覺了！你竟反常了！你竟像畜生一樣了！我們給一個尿鉢給畜生，牠也會知道用啦。你，你却想在壁爐的灰屑裏面打滾。天曉得，你竟便得我糊塗起來了，我會瘋啦，瘋啦，瘋啦！」</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚赤着雙脚，穿着件睡衣，凝視着尿鉢。昨天晚上没有尿鉢，現在却有一隻尿鉢在床底下。這空的潔白的尿鉢使得他眼眩，如果他還要固執地裝作不看見，那未免太不識相了。</p>
<p>他一家子旣已鬧得一塌糊塗，還有一些帶着嘲笑神氣的鄰居，送礁來的郵差，都和他　　，對他提出許多問題。</p>
<p>「我對你們發誓！」紅蘿蔔鬚終於回答了，眼睛望着尿鉢，「我，我簡直弄得莫明其妙了。隨你們擺佈罷。」</p>

<p>▲男甲鉛球　以參加人數之過多、分爲ＡＢ兩組、再合兩組之成績、以定優勝、光華附中孫用賓、以十一米四三冠軍、其次三人之成績、（二）大夏黄劍飛、十一米十一、（三）大夏汪德元、十米八十五、（四）復中沈天驥、十米七五、相差俱甚微、</p>
<p>▲男乙跳高　起跳者三十餘人、最後之四人爲上中魏曾善、廣肇劉光煦、南洋程祖鋆鍾德霖兩人、加至一米四十四、程鍾二人落選、魏劉爲一米四四、但加上退下、魏得第一、劉居第二、程鍾二人、競奪結果、程第三、鍾第四、</p>
<p>女甲跳遠　吴梅仙於百米落選後趕來、以四米十八成績居最優、最後三次中、又進步至四米二六、（二）戴浦則自三米七七、進步至三米九五、（三）陸美雲、自三米六七、進步至三米八十（四）陳榴珍、得三米七九、與陸美雲相差僅○·○一米、吴梅仙跑時能加速度、成績可更佳、</p>
<p>▲女乙跳遠　愛國關顏嬌冠軍、第四跳得三米七九、（二）容淑儉第五跳得三米七一、（三）李玉荷第一跳得三二米六九、（四）黄敬宗第五跳得三米六十六、相距皆甚接近、</p>
<p>▲男體跳高　共僅五人、一爲江南張家夔、一米五八五得第一、其餘四人爲東亞、二三四成績皆相等、於是退下回升、得分前後、</p>

<p>三十七、（四）東南鄒善德、四米十一、</p>
<h3 id="c220">徑賽戰况 <a href="#c220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>▲吴梅仙兩次罰出　吴梅仙女士、爲前哈爾濱四女傑之一、曾出席全國及遠東運動會、大名鼎鼎、運動界之紅人也、吴小姐現肄業於復旦實中、遂得現其色相於昨日之市中校運動會中、固最有希望之女將也、但昨在五十米賽中、竟因兩次偷跑罰出、聞者惋惜不置、乃希望於百米預賽、再瞻身手、不料又犯兩次偷跑被罰、可謂不幸之極、據復旦指導陳昺德言、吴之偷跑、實因平素習練、不聽指導、遂有今日之覆</p>
<p>轍、果爾、則昨日之被罰、足爲吴女士之殷鑒矣、</p>
<p>▲跳高欄缺少訓練　男甲組高欄預賽、四組中、無一人有良好之表演、成績之平庸、固不必論、其跑也、姿勢不佳、步伐不準、故倒欄甚多、成績因而不佳、實以平素缺少訓練、徑賽中、此項運動、可謂最乏興趣矣、</p>
<p>▲放鷂子大吃其虧　千五百米男甲預賽、共有一百人參加、爲上海各運動會之最高紀錄、每四組預賽、每組廿五人僅取三名、可謂難矣、觀每次預賽、缺乏經騐之賽員、每喜放鷂子、即自鳴槍起步後、竭盡平生之力、向前衝剌、以馬首自瞻、退落他人、誇耀於人、無如程長力不濟、一時之榮、難於持久、不到一圈、已精疲力竭、退落孫山、竟至於半途退出、謂之五分鐘熱度、恰甚切當、實不知力之如何使用耳、</p>
<p>▲女百米成績比較　女子百米甲乙組自吴梅仙小姐因偷跑罰出後、遂無良好成績出現、最佳者亦須十五秒、爲務本之蕭傑英、第二組原有五人與賽有三人偷跑罰出、僅二人逐鹿、完全錄取、大佔便宜、成績爲十六秒六、此之謂搭便宜貨也、又女體校中、亦無良好成績、</p>
<p>▲五十米功夫不差　女子甲乙組五十米、成績未見出色、惟女體校組、東亞陳畹卿及盛璧、功夫均不差、前者爲七秒四、後者爲七秒五、預料今日决賽、或更有可觀、東南之孫琤、與任淞二女士、終點衝剌極佳、至决勝線之一利那、姿勢美妙、殊有功夫、可謂深受訓練者矣、</p>
<p>▲男子百米有劇戰　男甲百米、人材頗爲平鈞、成績雖不佳、形勢殊緊縮、民立劉嘉獻、大夏李松年、復中林世華、光華董寅初、復中程忠宏、及南方關長發等、功夫相差無幾、决賽必有劇戰、</p>
<h3 id="c221">預賽成績 <a href="#c221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>

<p>— 百合</p>
<p>不多幾天之前，上海各報上都登着某外國通信社的消息，大意說，哈爾濱某俄婦的家裏，當俄婦不在家時，給賊把東西偷完了不算，連一椽四壁，都偷得片瓦不留。各報上刋載這個消息時，標題上都冠以「笨賊」二字。</p>
<p>這種曠古未有的偷法，的確似乎有些不可理解。甚麽東西不好偷，難道世界上没有比這些碎瓦殘磚再領錢的東西，而非偷這些東西不可麽？但是仔細一想，覺得「笨賊」二字，尚還有些不能十分肯定。</p>
<p>在内地，有「打悶棒」，「背娘舅」等跳梁小醜，「留下買路錢來」的好漢英雄，專打單行獨走的「孤雁兒」好說話些兒的，叩頭如搗蒜，還可一留得頭顱在，不怕不吃飯」，若是學過三天太極拳，一五斤很六斤」，不吃「餛飩」準吃「板刀麵」。這種行爲，百斯文朋友筆尖之下，便呌做「殺人越貨」。「殺人越貨」之後，一不做，二不休，再來一下子「毁屍滅迹」，以絶禍根。若是偷東西連房屋偷去的便是「笨賊」，那麽，「毁屍滅跡」，該是笨盜了。　　我們東北的一切主權，在「九一八」之前，早已給日本侵佔了不少，這正像「好漢遇到「孤雁兒」，「你的就是我的」了。「好漢」腰包裏的，是「孤雁兒」自己留下的買路錢。但是「好漢」一不做，二不休了，越貨，還要殺人，殺了人，還要毁屍滅跡，把東北整塊兒的土地，揷遍了交义着的日本旗與僞國旗。雖然了老太爺主張把没有主權的王地留給中國，「好漢」兀是「驢耳春風」，一往直前幹到底。</p>
<p>偷了東西，還要房屋，奪了主權，還要土地，有甚麽分别？</p>
<h3 id="c246">羣衆的力量 <a href="#c246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— 思素</p>
<p>日本兵實在厲害，無論宋哲元商震抵抗得怎樣强烈，只要假以月餘時日，灤東各縣終於又步了遼吉黑熱的後塵；國人或不免吃驚而灰心，以爲日本兵除非不進攻，進攻必勝，非中國所能抵抗。其實不盡然，中國本也有個必勝的武器，可惜國人不使用！這武器就是抵制日貨了。國人看到抵制日貨這四個字，又不免以爲老生常談，無甚新奇；可是這抵制的力量，也實在大得很呢！</p>
<p>北平曾有一家日人辦的順天時報，可算是文化侵略的先鋒，銷塲很大，據說竟有十萬份左右。這不爲别的，就是因該報無忌憚，什麽話都可說。例如北平在張作霖做大元帥與北伐軍拒戰的時代，國人辦的報紙都諱敗言勝；張大帥的忌諱又多，連梅蘭芳演一齣鳳還巢，也幾乎闖下殺身大禍，說是鳳諧音奉，咒詛他北平登不住，要回奉天老巢，正可和曹錕當道時代禁演打鼓駡曹相媲美。可是順天時報却不買張大師的賬，據實記載，北平人纔知道前方眞相，大家都買了看，張大帥也不能奈何它。誰知濟南出兵，發生抵貨風潮，先是國人自辦的報紙在社評上勸人抵制順天時報，喚起民族意識；大家的感情一衝動，就都不購閱，更禁不住國人商店停登廣告，經濟發生恐慌，不能支持，就此宣告中停版了。羣衆的力量有這樣偉大，假使全國人民都堅持對日貨不販不買，日本的整個經濟，就也要和順天時報一樣的恐慌到不能支持，自然歸於崩潰。中國人有這個必勝的武器，擱着不用，惟期待軍事勝利，豈不可惜！</p>

<p>在受數學的時候，正是大家偷看小說的時間；什麽「性史」，「飛絮」，「情書一束」，：：：都是這個鐘點内的好讀物。雖說是鬼鬼祟祟，偷偷摸摸，然而，總比沉悶的數學來得活潑，有趣！</p>
<p>厠所裏常常公佈着一般無名作家的「壁上文學」。您仔細地去觀察，正好像革命軍出發時的「標語」一樣地多。什麽「打倒飯桶敎授！」「打倒囗囗大胖子」！都是這裏的「好材料」！</p>
<p>星期六的報紙，大家都爭先恐後地亂抓；他們旣不是看什麽新聞，也不是讀什麽評論，他們所急欲知道的：是某家電影院，今夜映甚麽片子？和某家院今晚演甚麽劇目？</p>
<p>西裝男士的半身像，和紅墨水寫的妃色小信封，常常是放在女同學的枕下。　　飯後在操塲閒遊的，三三兩兩，且談且笑，它們不是義結金蘭的帖友，便是誼切桑梓的同鄕。</p>

<p>— 周敬之</p>
<p>㣲弱的陽光，從那樹影横斜的鋪道上，映透了我的窗帘。時候還只有七點鐘，而且又是大好的禮拜天！我正在温柔鄕中，追求好夢之時，忽然一陣陣悲慘的呼聲，驚醒我的春夢。</p>
<p>「賣孩子！男的十八元，女的八元」。在街旁坐着形似夫妻的一男一女；從憔悴女人的口裏，發出來的悲聲。</p>
<p>啊！繁華的都市，醉人的都市，不信，有這種矛盾的事實。男子十八元，女子八元，又是多麽價戝！然而求學的我，眞有愛莫能助之慨！祇有痴望着他們的悽影而一陣陣的悽楚聲擊動了我的心靈。</p>
<p>Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ</p>
<p>「賣孩子！男子十八元，女子八元」。</p>
<p>「························」</p>
<p>從早晨至中午，足足喊了幾個鐘頭，自始至終，都是那樣夠人回味，我眞不信，生活富裕的人們，竟没有一個慈悲者，竟讓他們呼號，除了幾個苦力，表示同情嘆息之外，這在他們的目光中，視爲失望，無關痛癢。</p>
<p>聲音漸漸的低渺了，十八元及八元的賣價已減至十二元，五元了，可是悲哀的事實，又誰肯帮助他們呢？又誰憐憫他們的遭遇而加以援助呢？</p>
<p>在夕陽黄昏時，我目送着他們的黑影，隱隱銷没，不過「賣孩子」的聲浪，依然盤旋在我的惱海裏。</p>

<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第五回　煮茗度長宵愴懷歲暮題標抗暴日呐喊聲高</p>
<p>江氏道：這可不像話，憑一個人怎樣文明，後代香烟，不能說不要，要不然，大家全不在乎，世人那兒還有人種呢？談話談到了這裏，算提起了趙翁無限的心事，酒也醒了，酒話也没了，手上拿了個空茶杯子，只是出神，瞧見鐵爐子上放的那一壺熱水，已經是開了，咕嘟咕嘟，由壺嘴裏和蓋縫裏，向外冒着白氣。江氏也看出了，年三十夜，别讓老頭子傷心，就笑道：老太爺你呌我包餃子的，麫和好了嗎？趙翁道：麫和好了，餡兒也預備好了，就是差着包。江氏道：咱們在這裏談話，也别把兩隻手閑着，我娘兒倆，可以跟你先包起來。趙翁是個好動的人，聽說之後，就自己到廚房裏去，將一綠瓦盆麫，和一鉢子餡兒，全端了出來。於是江氏娘兒倆洗了一把手臉，將麫和餃子餡，放在方凳子上，圍着方凳子包起來，趙翁拿了一塊麫粉杖，放在旁邊，盛着伊們包好了的餃子。許久，他不覺嘆了一口氣道：光陰眞是快啊！記得我小的時候‘，三十晚上守歲，我媽和我姐姐包餃子，我在旁邊看着，不也就是這種情形嗎？轉眼就是五十年了。桂枝道：有道是，混日子，混日子，無論什麽事，一混起來就眞快。我們平常燒一壺開水，要費多大的事，你看，我們隨便放一壺水在這鐵爐子上，不知不覺的就開了。這一句話，提醒了趙翁，他笑道：再要不冲茶，水都會熬乾了。於是他兌了三杯茶，放在棹上，還不曾分開來時，桂枝就接着壺去加了冷水，提了壺來，放在爐子上，先捧一杯給趙爺，再捧一杯給母親，趙翁一手端了茶杯，一手摸了鬍子，向着桂枝笑道：這位姑娘，心眼很靈活，我跟前要有這樣子一個，我就痛快多了。江氏笑道：我不是說了嗎？老太爺這樣疼他，他是個没爹的孩子，就讓他拜在老太爺跟前作乾姑娘得了。（五五）</p>

<p>— 朱青雲</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>天是這般的冷，狂風暴雨中，還夾着雪花；在灰色的低暗天空裏，亂箭般的猛射。那敵方的重砲，更轟轟的亂吼，好似已發了狂，那大口徑的砲彈，早一顆顆，一而再，再而三的接連着在空中飛躍。可怕的爆烈聲，擁着那飛濺的泥土和樹木，像颶風捲起的水柱，一根根飛濺起來，在那砲彈炸烈的火光裏。</p>
<p>我軍遥戰壕裏，水是這般的深，已快把那墊的藁草，浸得快浮起來了。風雪的寒威，和重砲的轟擊，使得我戰、壕裏的戰士們，包圍在慘厲和危險的環境裏。軍械雖然不利，但他們有沸騰的熱血，悲壯之雄心，仍極鎭靜的埋伏着和期待着，雖然眼瞧着那可怕的砲彈，不時落在戰壕上，把那不很堅固的防禦工程，和壕内抗敵同志，一起飛濺起來，然他們祗有悲憤，祇有報仇的心，拚着血肉的身體，和環境掙扎砲聲是稀少了，那雜亂沉重的脚步聲，夾着那笛笛啦啦的衝鋒號聲，在朔風中捲將過來；那一班黄衣的矮兵，早參差不齊，排是着一條戰線，在黑暗中好似幢幢鬼影，一步步向前衝鋒。敵人越走越近，我軍已奉到迎頭痛擊的命令，將士們鬰結的悲憤，在驚天動地的一聲呐喊中，發洩出來，那刷刷的機關槍，和轟轟的手溜彈，一陣掃射之後，前排的矮兵已排山似的倒下，但後面死不完的敵人，可是潮水般的湧來；可是我方的子彈，却已快要破產。</p>
<p>「上前，幹！」一個弟兄，早抽出他背上那柄雪也似的大刀，把身子略略結束，躍出壕外。「好！上前。」早有許多士兵，一個個抽出大刀，跳到壕外，一起舞動那柄大刀，霍霍地好似無數雪球，直向敵人人潮中滾去。</p>
<p>呼呼的刀，砰砰的槍，悽厲的慘呼，混成了一團。這是血肉和利器的掙扎！丨丨微弱的一絲公理的掙扎。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>一年四季大减價的商店中，竟常常發見：「意在停業，撈回血本」，和「關店拍賣，特别犧牲」的標語。年頭是這般不景氣，普通的商店，都在崩潰的經濟裏面，掙扎生存。社會上失業的人，因此也一天增多一天。</p>
<p>他自從服務的公司改組丨就是出盤丨之後，就一直做了失業的人。雖是東也求人謀事，西也托人介紹，可是五六月來，還是謀不到一個相當職業。小家庭的開支，雖然極力節省，但在這生活日高的當兒，五塊錢的房金，十元左右的伙食，以及人事酬酢，憑你怎樣緊縮，二十元左右的開支，是萬不能再縮省的了。</p>
<p>好容易托着一個親戚，寄了一份履歷，和他平日的文稿和字樣去，才得到下列的一封回信「尊事由弟竭力斡旋，敝處書記某君，適因病出缺，兄如願屈就者，祈卽來滬就職，該位薪水二十番，不供膳食，惟際此人浮於事之秋，如此苦職，謀者綦多，不得不盼兄早來，免爲他人捷足佔去也：：：：」</p>
<p>二十元除去膳食，在那不易居的上海，還能寄幾塊到家裏？然而不去呢，連這幾個錢，也不能到手，去呢，果然仍舊不敷家用，不過不去，來日大難，却更不堪設想了。他想着，嘆了口氣，和他的妻彼此商量一下，决計離開故鄕，去就這不敷生活的職業。</p>
<p>春風是這般料峭，氣候是這般寒冷，然而車站上却擠滿着爲生活掙扎的征人。他上旅途去了，雖明知生活的掙扎，兀是在不安定的環境裏，可是除了前進掙扎，再也没有第二條路徑血肉和利器的掙扎，生命和經濟的掙扎，寫出了我國現代的縮影。</p>

<p>救國，據說並不是一個使人聞而掩鼻却走的名詞，丨反之却頗爲時尚，如「跳舞救國」「娱樂救國」「玉容救國」之類，大槪時至今日，國之須當救，已可無疑義，只是「文字立國」的咱們，於「名敎」素頗講究，關於選言遣詞，却不無可議，丨蓋「名不正，則言不順」也，</p>
<p>最近報載粤省成立了一個「自動救國會」，顧名思義，其由於民衆而非政府强迫可知，救國而必須出於「自動」，大有自己「開車」之槪，其亦不得已也乎，然而危矣丨</p>
<p>自從「九一八」日本人的砲火轟進了中國以後，「救國」之聲就洋洋乎盈國中，但這責任究竟誰屬？丨是「政權」呢？還是「治權」？因無明文規定，至今還不十分了然，有的說這是人民的責任，但自「長期抵抗」一變到「絶對不言抗</p>
<p>日」之後，這又似乎是一二在上位者的事，小民無所用其操心。丨總之是並無憲法規定，祇須你不「危害民國」便可算作良民，救與不救，其間頗有自由。丨</p>
<p>或許不救之救，焉能救得身家性命的安全在這一動動不得的年頭，還是安靜點吃一點好，放大量一點，認砲火爲烟火或有聲電影，亦無不可，飯後無事，翻開報紙，看看捷報也好。丨你不須問這捷報是從那一方來的丨「抗日」或「剿匪」，也不用管他所「暫首」「俘獲」的是那一國的人，總之，凡是捷報都好。現在我們内有賢相，外有良將，還怕救不了區區中國，凡我小民，雖曰「内憂外患」，實在「均不起懼」。故「救國」一事，以理言，「絶對不能」，以勢言，亦無此必要，大可息息。如認爲萬非得已，或蒙落伍之嫌，那末，擇其性之所近丨如「跳舞」「吸烟」之類，「共赴共赴」亦無不可。祇須記着跟定他人脚跟，萬勿輕舉妄動丨這不是你的權利丨否則一動而做成與題相反的結論，那就不是可喜而有點可吊了。</p>

<p>— 云</p>
<p>幾天前黄公館裏眞是忙得不堪，據說是二少爺結婚大禮快到，他的母親在去年冬天就曾一度細察考慮，如何使「新房」得以美觀，直到如今佈置將就完竣，總是花了不少心血的了，所以二少爺的新房也就點綴得富麗堂皇。</p>
<p>因爲黄太太的抱孫之念太切的緣故，她皺着多紋的臉盤上，不時的流露着不少的笑痕，喜氣洋洋的和兒子打算盤，買這樣啦，辦那樣啦，有時候似乎有些不信任人家，於是親自坐着自備汽車出去買辦。當這初春季節，大槪年老人，容易害病罷，稍事勞頓的黄太太，居然病了。而且人事不知，顯然是十分危險的哩。傭婦們開始晝夜的輪流服侍太太。據醫生說是「老病」，也没有多大危險的，這來二少爺心安神定了。可是在另一方面呢？嫂子和他的大哥却把媽的這場病，看作毫無關係，當然談不上、什</p>
<h3 id="c276">勿講道理 <a href="#c276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>麽憂慮。不僅如此而已，他們甚至於眼巴巴的望着她死，因爲她死了對於他們有着天大的好處。</p>
<p>自從黄太太病倒之後，忽的半個月去了，但病依然不見好。算命的說是二少爺的這樁喜事，選個吉日提前舉行「冲冲喜」，那末她的病將見起死回生不藥而愈想不到的效力呢。</p>
<p>夜深了，這裏靜寂可得怕，直如死</p>

<p>神來臨了人間一樣可怕啊！</p>
<p>「媽，可有舒服些了？」二少爺輕言細語的安慰着。</p>
<p>「···痛，心痛···」她欷歔着。</p>
<p>「你的病就會好的，請你寬心些，睡熟吧！」</p>
<p>「唉！他們爲什麽都不想來看看我？養大了，就不懂孝順，正怪不得天要反了，不像一個好世界！活也無趣處，到不乾脆的死了的好！」</p>
<p>「媽媽，不容再生氣了，你這樣不是會病上加病嗎？你放心罷，將來小媳婦過之後，一定會孝敬你老人家的。」</p>

<p>編者先生；</p>
<p>吾的妻妹，今年二十歲；十六歲時，憑媒妁配於同鄕的一個同年的農家子，是没有憑據的。吾妻妹的對方，是一個没有職業的惡少；他的父親，是嗜好鴉片的，田房屋產，都賣完了。岳母等見此情形，眼見過門之後，無以爲生，母女倆哭哭啼啼，來到吾處，要吾營救出這苦海。吾見她母女倆可憐，不得不替她設法。</p>
<p>先生，吾的家是在太倉鄕間的，吾妻妹悦耳</p>
<p>的對方的父親，性很强蠻：他聞知這風聲，就揚言欲出强硬的手段，來搶親了。吾想在鄕間終是不妙，想領她到上海來謀生活，另配對方。對那舊對方，置之不理。</p>
<p>先生，他那舊對方，可能對吾提起拐逃的訴訟嗎？恭請代吾擇一條出路，則十分感謝。祝你</p>
<p>前程萬里　胡乃吴謹上</p>

<p>編者按：我國各地，訂婚的手續，都半是但憑介紹人的人證，並没有相當</p>
<p>物證。即使有的地方，行一種交換年庚</p>
<p>帖式的手續，但因爲這種年庚帖子，並不經過簽花着押，算不得一種物證。這種習慣，法庭上承認的；所以胡君的妻妹，許配的事實，不因没有憑證而不生効力。查她訂婚的時候，年祇十六，尚未成年，當然由家長代理，所以這件婚約在法律上是成立的，不過現在她成年後，本人不願意，得要求解除罷了。解除手續，當然以協議爲最好；萬一兩方各執一見，那末祗有請求法院宣告，結果不及要破鈔幾個錢罷了；只要胡君的妻妹，一口咬定不願，法院也不能强制的。置之不理，是辦不到的。</p>
<p>講到搶親一層，根本是不必怕的。訂婚不過是一種契約，而且在各種契約裏邊，他的効力最小。爲什麽呢？因爲民法規定，無論如何，婚約不能强迫履行。夫婦的身分，要在結婚以後，方始開始；訂婚以後，結婚以前，女的還是屬於本生父母家族裏的一員。未婚夫誘　未婚妻，除非她的家長不予追究，會成立姦非罪的！搶親！那更了得　强姦罪是無逃呢！不過中國社會裏！處女一還是被人重視的，所以每每搶親之後，</p>
<p>將錯就錯，忍而不究罷了。</p>
<p>你現在想把你的妻妹，領到上海來謀生，是對的。他們不能提起拐逃之訴。因爲現在你的妻妹，還是你岳母家裏的一員，這種妨害家庭罪的拐逃罪，他們是没有資格出首告訴的。不過你要另外替他對親，那末最好要在她第一次的婚約，宣告解除以後。</p>

<p>各大學敎授救國協會所給予他的影象雖極惡劣，可是他還没有完全灰心，在家裏傷感了幾天之後，便又躍躍欲試的想找一個别的救國團體去參加。給他的祖國出些力量了。</p>
<p>「啊！這人才是中華民國的好男兒！他所主持的後援會，再不會虚浮的了，快去見見他吧！」某一日的下午，伍逸無意中在新聞紙上讀到了一條驚人的消息，不覺又興奮起來。這一項消息大意如下：</p>
<p>義軍後援會常委許松樵脫險經過</p>
<p>「：：：該會常務委員許松樵君，素抱抗日决心，經營會務，不遺餘力，乃遭某國人之忌：本月某日，在狀元巷中央飯店後面，忽爲人刦登汽車，疾馳而去。：：：一周以來，消息杳然，戚友咸疑爲帮架勒贖之案，正在：：：不意許君忽於昨日深夜三時左右脫險歸來，據云：：：看守者盡屬某國人，日僅給白飯一盆，蘿葡乾二三條，：：：種種虐待，遍體鱗傷。：：：昨宵乘看守者熟睡之際，破壁逸出，徒步狂奔四五十里，雙足俱繭，氣息僅屬。：：：現已返寓靜養，决於全愈後，仍繼續抗日救國工作。：：：若許君者，眞今世之熱血志士矣！：：：」</p>
<p>伍逸雖和許松樵素昩平生，全不知道他是怎樣的一個人，可是瞧了這一段記載，便不由不油然起敬起來，深悔早上不就看報，忙問明了首都義勇軍後援會的地址，怱怱地趕去：不料到那所在一瞧，照牌是有的，而且邊還掛着一方什麽通信社的牌子，可是這屋子上已貼着首都警察廳的封皮，由鐵將軍把門了，倒使他大爲詫異起來。</p>
<p>「啊！伍校長嗎？」伍逸正在恍恍惚惚地亂轉的當兒，恰巧有一個當巡官的走過。丨這巡官以前在Ｘ大當校警，所以也認得他，一見便走過來招呼。</p>
<p>「呀！你是李金標，李先生嗎？」伍逸見是故人，忙把目前這一件奇事向他</p>
<p>可是他們太激烈了些吧？眞是豈有此理！」</p>
<p>伍逸也不問青紅皂白，說話中便很帶些責備警察廳不該壓制愛國運動的語氣。</p>
<p>「哈哈！太激烈嗎？不，不，你全弄錯了！伍校長。」李巡官透着一種極幽</p>
<p>默的笑容，說道：「他們是滑頭！他們是騙子！今天報上登的那一個許什麽樵的已給我們廳裏抓起來了！揑造謠言，詐欺取財，：：：論罪名，至少得吃三年官司！」</p>
<p>李金標這一說，格外使伍逸茫無頭緒了。</p>
<p>「咱們上那裏喝鐘茶，細談細談如何？」伍逸這樣請求着。</p>
<p>「不敢當！卽是所校長瞧待起我，理當奉陪。」李金　一面說，一面擺着下屬見上司那般恭　之的一　好架子一讓伍逸先走在前面，自己却垂着手，相離一步路，在</p>

<p>— 羅芬</p>
<p>軟紅塵中的樂園</p>
<p>好萊塢是屬於加利福尼亞州，氣候温和。在嚴寒的冬天，漸漸消失後，可愛的春天跟着來了。山頂上的積雪溶化了，樹枝上的翠芽呈露了，和煦的春風籠罩了大地。這是好萊塢一年中最有生氣的時候。明星們精神飯滿，鼓着勇氣工作。</p>
<p>離開好萊塢的熱鬧區域幾哩路，高的山互相接連着，山中一片沙地，在半山上，是一個美國全國聞名的泉源，呌做棕櫚泉（Ｐｏｌｍ　Ｓｐｒｉｎｇ）。在冬天人跡很少，但一到春天，這棕櫚泉一帶，就有許多好萊塢的人物，在辛勤工作之後，來此徜徉游息。山頂上，山脚下，都是他們的世界。幾位有名的大明星當然都築有别墅，整個的春天消磨在山清水秀之間。</p>
<p>平日最講究光陰經濟的大鼻子傑美杜倫，在這可愛的春天，也手中夾着雪茄，頭上戴着軟帽，在棕櫚泉畔，過幾天不經濟光陰的日子，</p>
<p>却爾斯賴甫頓，他演完了「羅宮春色」之後，很覺得好萊塢這個地方熙熙攘攘太無味。他本來是英國人，所以很想回英國去。那天他的朋友拖他到了棕櫚泉去游春，賴甫頓一致那邊，幾疑不在好萊塢地方。他竟想不到好萊塢這樣的混濁世界之旁，還有這樣一個清靜的所在。他於是住在那邊，再不提要回來國去的話了。</p>
<p>瓊克勞馥是喜歡獨游的。她自己駕着汽車跑到棕櫚泉，在她的别墅中住着。天天在山頂上徘徊，坐在山腰中的岩石上，到了黄昏，她還是捨不得離去。她向人說，「在這樣的風景包圍着四周，人生任何的苦惱都可以丢去，吸一回清鮮的空氣，人生一世，能有幾天這樣的清福享憂，怎麽捨得？」</p>
<p>珍妮蓋諾是不問時季的，工作一有暇，立刻到棕櫚泉去住着。她平均算起來，住在棕櫚泉的時候比住在皮佛萊山的家中多。却爾法雷也是棕櫚泉的老主顧但是他現在已脫離了影界，或者要變成稀客了。</p>
<p>棕櫚泉的歷史雖已很久，但是名聲還是靠着好萊塢而得的。實際講起來，棕櫚泉附近的風景，也不亞於黄石公國，祇一切都是天然本色，並没人工參雜。高大的建築物除了山脚下一所蜜萊度飯店Ｅｌ　Ｍｉｒａｄｏｌ　Ｈｏｔｅｌ之外没有了，住紅樓巨厦厭了的好萊塢人物，對之自有無限感念發生。</p>

<p>昨天國泰開映的「紅塵」，有一個從黑暗中跳出來的琪痕哈綠，可是熱得不及從前那樣透沸，野女没有從前那樣野得厲害。另外還有一個始終不能使人歡喜的克拉克蓋勃爾；然而她一定要裝做粗暴的漢子，因之要使「柔情似水」，有所不能，要使「熱戀如火」，也不過只是紙上談兵，目的不過在打動觀衆的下意識。全片劇情就是把一回三角戀愛，從看慣了的都市，搬到熱帶的安南地方，這便可以省去許多要化資本的佈景，光線差點也可以使觀衆原諒。而意外的好處，還可以借用突地飛來一陣熱帶裏常有的紅塵，在觀衆還没有認清楚是什麽一回事之前，却又鏡頭一換銀幕上又是風平浪靜了。再來幾幕雨景使影戲前後有了變化，可是大雨的時候，天空的兩大片烏雲之中，露出一塊白的，不管風括得怎麽緊，或雨下得怎麽大，却老是停在那兒動也不動。</p>
<p>以前的所謂香艷肉感影片，大多數是女的脫衣給男的看，在本片裏，却是男的脫衣暗示給女的看，這或者就是所謂「熱而且野的女人，歡喜相暴的漢子」的精彩地方吧？講到「精暴」，有的地方却太粗暴。這粗暴的漢子，高高蹲在樹上，一槍打死了一只老虎，後來他因情變而給她一手槍，却好像剌了一刀似的小事，他手按着腰，稍稍傴側身子，却並没有跌倒在地，自己還能好好的坐上椅子，吩咐另外一個所謂熱而且野的女人，來替這個粗暴的漢子救治。他没有死，所以他的粗暴比老虎還厲害；如其不幸他就此因傷而死，這本影片，就此做不下去，所謂熱而且野的女人，就此歡喜不到粗暴的漢子了，這部三角戀愛的故事，也就此歸宿不到美滿的結局了。</p>
<p>「紅塵」裏面的俏皮話，却能點綴着全片在「紅塵」開映之前，還有一短片狗做的影戲，這眞是狗戲！然而那許多狗，却是衣冠楚楚，不用四隻脚跑，却用兩只腿作人走路。狗開口的時候，却配以人的言語；觀衆們眼見着狗嘴一啓一閉，同時就可以耳聽得一言一語，狗嘴人語，嘖嘖怪事！這種眞是滑天下之大稽的勾當。或者這也可以說是科學萬能吧！總而言之，統而言之，狗戲醜態百出，使人不知所云。如其說從前琳丁丁一只狗，尙且成爲狗明星，現在集衆狗於一片，更可以滿足觀衆的好奇心，那末這種好奇心眞是要不得也。</p>
<h3 id="c281">古國艷乘Ｔｈｅ　Ｍｕｍｍｙ <a href="#c281" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e281" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">281</a></h3>
<p>— 燕南</p>
<p>前天卡爾登換映的古國艷乘Ｍｕｍｍｙ是一張神怪片，神怪片的故事總是光怪陸離的，所以比較詳細一些的記在下面。</p>
<p>一九二二年，埃及的英國考古家找着一個木乃伊，但是因爲不小心，打開了一幅古文咒語，所以木乃伊復活，攫咒而去。一九三二年，另有一些考古家，又打算有所發現，那時木乃伊跑到駐紮所，指示出三千七百年前，某埃及公主的陵寢，果然掘出陳列，在埃及的英國博物院裏。木乃伊向屍誦咒，知道公主已再轉人世，爲一埃及世家女郎，木乃伊盡力想奪她爲己有，並說出三千七百年前一段未遂的戀史</p>
<p>，打算與她同死，以求精神的結合。但是内中有一青年考古家，他父親死在木乃伊之手，他也深愛女郎，於是與木乃伊暗中成爲仇敵，但木乃伊神通廣大，能知過去未來的事，能制人於千里之外。考古家雖到木乃伊家裏，目睹木乃伊將要害死女郎，但愛莫能助，正在危急，木乃伊屋中所奉的神偶，忽發金光萬道，不但考古家精神爲之一振，不畏妖術，而木乃伊也竟成爲腐屍，身碎片片，於是女郎乃得無恙。　　編劇者的目的，是要絶頂的神秘，使觀衆恐怖緊張，所以完全脫離現實，成了一種荒誕不經的幻想品，理性當然是談不到的，但是末尾以邪不侵正作結束，却是很巧妙而可取的。</p>
<p>結構上全片非常緊凑，一貫而下，其中恐怖的地方，連續而來，非但「荒島怪人」「恐怖窟」遠不及這張片，就是神怪巨作「科學怪人」，對此也有遜色，藝術上的成功，在一切恐怖片之上。</p>
<p>導演也還不錯，有很好的劇情和演員，導演雖然不費甚麽事，但是演出的時候，他的能力也是不弱，有些瑣碎的小鏡頭，和暗寫穿揷，都是極生色的。許多似完非完的換幕，非但不覺脫節，反有餘味可尋。攝影也非常優美。的是能手。佈景有埃及的古色古香。光線，收音，也與攝影，並駕齊驅：：：總之，技術上是找不出甚麽漏洞的。</p>
<p>末尾，我再談談這片中的生色演員：克洛夫Ｂｏｒｉｓ　Ｋａｒｌｏｆｆ以神怪片出名，他遲緩的動作，極合木乃伊的身份，化裝的細緻，也絶不是别人所能模仿的。上次他演的僵屍，以離奇過甚而被禁，一般人引爲遺憾，這次他仍是那麽一個神怪角色，而我們竟能看到，眞是影片的命運，也是有幸有不幸啊！飾女郎的是琪塔裘漢Ｚｉｔａ　Ｊｏｈａｎｎ，頗有埃及古美女的典型，表演也屬上流。此外，有一個考古家因木乃伊復活，驚嚇而瘋狂，因瘋狂而大笑，異常深刻。别的配角都差多了。</p>
<p>總之，牠的優美，是描寫不完的，特别是木乃伊述說三千年前的舊事一幕，令人神往。所以這張片子也許可說是任何人都能得到滿意的吧！</p>
<h3 id="c282">化裝木乃伊之原料 <a href="#c282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>— 羅芬</p>
<p>環球公司之最近巨片「古國艷乘」</p>
<p>Ｔｈｅ　Ｍｕｍｍｙ「原譯名爲木乃伊」爲偉大之歷史片。其中的本事是叙述埃及古時名人死後，以香料塗身，而使永久不腐，以及種種歷史上傳流下來涉及木乃伊的故事。主角飾木乃伊就是「科學怪人」中的怪物保里斯卡洛夫。他在這部「古國艷乘」中用各種化裝術化成又瘦又小鳩形鵠面的木乃伊，使自己身體縮小，這是一件很不容易的事。</p>
<p>保里斯卡洛夫所飾的木乃伊，據說已三千七百歲。保里斯化裝時面上用水濕潤後，用棉花貼在面上極薄的一層再塗哥洛澱「假象牙溶液」而敷上一層酒精樹脂，使哥洛澱收縮。身體上用綳布紮緊後塗樹脂，手足用橡膏綳帶緊紮。胸部緊紮後，呼吸極難，而保里斯能忍耐工作，每次到五小時之久，最後一幕，保里斯延至八小時。保里斯爲千面人郎却奈死後僅有之一人，好萊塢雖大，並無第二人有肯爲藝術而犧牲其生命者。</p>
<h3 id="c283">湯姆密克斯的過去 <a href="#c283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>— 東林</p>
<p>曾參加八國聯軍</p>
<p>不久以前，本刋曾有人，因湯姆密克斯之引退，撰文爲之惋惜者。此種事是大可不必的。未知某君對於湯姆密克斯的生平，有所聞見否？</p>
<p>當湯姆密斯克未入銀幕之前，係美國軍隊的一小軍官。一八九九年八國聯軍攻打京城時，彼亦參於是役；當時據稱，曾殺死無數中國人民。戰事停止後，因身受重傷而退伍。雖然義和團事件是清朝自己醖釀的禍事，但是殺我們同胞的人，總是我們的仇人。那麽對於湯姆斯的引退，</p>
<p>我們還要惋惜他做甚麽尼？</p>
<p>編者註：東林君之意見，雖出於愛國之心，但亦有錯誤處。戰爭之時，旣</p>
<p>不能殺敵致果，徒於事後追念前忿，或懷恨參加戰事之某個私人，是無益而有損的，因爲這樣說來，豈非全世界的人，都是我們的仇人？</p>

<p>— 訥</p>
<p>琪茵現在傷心極了，她心想像愛倫這樣一個忠心的僕婦，怎會這樣地欺凌舊主起來呢。所以她說「是的，這世界變化得太奇怪了。愛倫，你亦變了，你的内心，已經不似從前了。愛倫，我們再會吧」。愛倫聽了，怒氣勃勃的不可遏止，她說：「你爲什麽還要擺臭架子，攅我走呢」？</p>
<p>正當她們爭吵得越來越厲害的當兒，侍女拿了一封電報進來。琪茵拿了電報，拆開看了。她向愛倫道：「你不用再爲蘩妮喬易担憂了。他亦不再回來了。他死了」！</p>
<p>愛倫連忙走向前一步，扶住琪茵。琪茵暈過去了，倒在愛倫的懷中，電報掉在地上。愛倫喊着：「夫人！我的夫人」！這時愛倫纔恢復了她的本性，還是一個忠心事主的僕婦。</p>
<p>休戰之後，倫敦不免有狂歡慶祝之舉。琪茵一人彳亍街中要在人羣中尋覓愛子喬易導之返家。在汽笛鳴鳴鐘聲噹噹的慶祝聲中，人羣在馬路上唱着歌，跳着舞，有時她被無知的慶祝者，拉住了在馬路上跳舞。她無精打彩地回到家裏，愛子没有尋到，帽子上，喉嚨上，繞了許多紅綠五彩的紙條。她恍恍惚惚地想起了若干年以前，亦曾有過一次這樣的狂歡，恐怕就是那南菲洲茂甫根的解圍吧！</p>
<p>戰事完了，一切都變了，不可信的變遷！罪惡之潮，一天一天的湧起來；人民要忘記戰爭的慘痛，都從事於縱慾與狂放；於是而有夜總會，男舞伴，强盜綁匪等等，使街上玩耍的小孩子，受機關槍的掃射！這許多比戰爭還要可可怕。還有那報紙上天天登載的離婚案。和平越走越遠了！國家與國爭吵仍不休；國際聯盟如同一個空夢；失業，飢餓，暴動，充滿了英國的境内。</p>
<p>這樣又是一年的年終。羅伯舉起杯來向着琪茵道：「又是一年過去了！」琪茵情不自禁的打了一個寒噤。她道：「又是一年在眼前」！遠處的鐘聲又響了；街上鬧轟轟的人們，歌唱着奥蘭山的調兒，這個調兒使琪茵的心都碎了。她站在她丈夫的身旁說：「一切的光榮和勝利，都已成了過去的陳跡；一切的憂愁苦悶，都已如夢中的悲歡。我們現在喝杯酒，一則紀念我們的兩個爲國捐軀的兒子；一則紀念我們自己已隨他們死去的心情」！他們喝着酒，看見一隊一隊的人物，如雲烟漂渺的現在他們眼花撩亂之前；這些已往的人物，都是他二人生活的一部份丨勃烈吉斯和愛倫舉着杯慶祝新世紀的降臨；小孩子穿着睡衣站在旁邊，露着驚奇的眼光；藹蒂絲和愛德華互相笑視着，綿綿不盡的相戀；喬易的童氣，永久不會長大了；瑪格雷的一種勇敢向前的氣概；蘩妮，倫敦惟一的鮮花，但她芳心之中永遠有喬易存留着丨丨羅伯和琪茵還是相視笑着，還是懷着希望向前一直到天地的盡頭。「完」</p>

<p>(Moscow) According to local sources, the turmoil in Xinjiang has spread to the provincial capital. Jin Shuren has left Dihua for Tacheng. (27th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Since the Hui Muslim Incident in Xinjiang occurred, outsiders still lack clarity regarding the true situation. A reporter recently obtained a reliable report from a certain organization stating that there are two reasons for this turmoil: (1) Discord between the Hui and Han ethnic groups in Xinjiang. Jin Shuren, the chairman of the Xinjiang Provincial Government, mishandled the situation, leading to unanimous resentment from the Hui Muslims. (2) The Hui Muslims are dissatisfied with Jin Shuren's oppressive policies. It is reported that Jin has already fled from Dihua on the 13th of this month. Order in the provincial capital is maintained by Zheng, the acting brigade commander of Su Bingwen's unit of the Righteous Army, and it is still peaceful. There are only three or four thousand troops throughout Xinjiang Province. Because the Hui Muslims only oppose Jin Shuren in this incident and are still extremely obedient to the Central Government, if the Central Government immediately selects senior officials who are respected by the Hui Muslims to go and appease and handle the situation, the turmoil can be quelled immediately; otherwise, it will spiral out of control. It is heard that the Central Government is paying close attention to this matter and will send senior officials within the next few days, as well as dispatching various specialized personnel to handle and appease the situation. The situation in Xinjiang should be stabilized. (27th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) President Wang told reporters: (1) I will not go north to comfort the troops, because working more practically in the capital is better than going north to comfort the troops. As for comfort items, I have already raised some donations and remitted them to the front. Even if it is necessary to go north, I will not go to the front lines to comfort the troops in my personal capacity. (2) The establishment of an administrative organ in North China will definitely not be resolved by the Executive Yuan. If it belongs to the Party, it should be decided by the Central Committee. If it belongs to politics, it should be decided by the National Government. (3) Resolving the Xinjiang incident cannot be accomplished by sending a single senior official. An inspection group is currently being organized, selecting experts from both Han and Hui sides to form it. After entering Xinjiang, they will thoroughly resolve issues such as religion, politics, education, society, and economy. The selection of personnel is currently under consideration. (27th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) In addition to urgently telegraphing Jin Shuren, the Central Government is urging him to handle the Xinjiang incident with caution and not allow the situation to escalate further. It has been decided to select senior officials to go and handle the situation. It is rumored that Shao Yuanchong or He Yaodu are being considered. (27th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Lanzhou) The Ma Bufang Division stationed in Ganzhou and the Ma Buqing Division stationed in Liangzhou will not participate in the Jia纒 Incident. The Central Government telegraphed the Ma Zhongying Division not to enter Xinjiang. The Hui and ethnic groups in Hami should wait quietly for a resolution. Jin Shuren is not allowed to use military force to oppress Hami. Li Qia, a representative of the Central Government, will investigate nearby. The Ma Zhongying Division has already crossed Xingxingxia and advanced westward. The Hui have long planned to overthrow Jin, and once it erupted, the momentum was immense. The people of Gansu are fearful that it will turn into a tragic conflict between the Hui and Han, and many have hidden worries. It is learned here from Beijing radio that the Central Government believes that the chairman of Xinjiang Province, Jin Shuren, has been hasty in his handling of affairs and inappropriate in his response and has decided to dismiss him. Possible successors include He Yaodu and Chu Minyi and a decision will be announced soon. (27th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Luo Wengan stated that although the Japanese army in eastern Luan and Xifengkou seems to be retreating, it is not known whether they have other plans. Our soldiers at the front must not relax in the slightest, lest they fall into their cunning schemes. We must not simply expect the enemy to retreat on their own or rely on international aid. As for the League of Nations' restrictions on Japan, various countries have concerns regarding military or economic sanctions due to their own situations, so progress is slow, but it has not been abandoned; it is only a matter of time. However, the Chinese people should have full awareness and make efforts themselves. If we believe that the serious situation between Japan and Russia and the US's convening of the World Economic Recovery Conference are beneficial to our country, this view is extremely dangerous, because the issue with Japan is our own affair. How can we rely on others to achieve satisfactory results without effort? (27th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Results of Talks in Washington: Britain and America Find a Way to Cooperate</p>
<h3 id="e26">### MacDonald Issues Joint Statement, Agreeing to Restore International Monetary Standard, Increase Prices, Work to Remove Trade Barriers, and Re-establish All Industries on a Solid Foundation <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) British Prime Minister MacDonald, after crossing the ocean to America to discuss the world economy and disarmament issues with US President Roosevelt, boarded a train for New York this afternoon, scheduled to set sail at midnight and return to his country. British experts will remain in Washington to discuss unresolved issues with American experts, and then separate after the British and American proposals to be submitted to the London Conference are agreed upon. When MacDonald departed, US President Roosevelt and former French Premier Herriot personally escorted him to the steps of the East Gate of the White House. Secretary of State Hull and other government officials escorted him to the station. When the whistle blew, carrying MacDonald away, the American officials were deeply impressed, believing that a feasible way had been found to solve the war debt problem, restore the international monetary standard, and revive world trade. Britain, France, and the United States will be able to work together on a simple plan to re-establish all industries on a solid foundation. Although the consent reached by the US President and the British Prime Minister regarding the proposals that the two countries will put forward at the World Economic Conference, and the understanding reached on other events that individually affect the two countries, have not been published in detail, judging from the published communique, the two men did not have any major disagreements. The joint communique issued by the two men today for the last time is the clearest and most explicit, demonstrating the points on which the British and American executives have agreed, including:</p>
<p>(1) As soon as the environment permits, the international monetary standard must be rebuilt immediately. This standard will undoubtedly be gold, but the proposed basis has not been published.</p>
<p>(2) Prices that have fallen for a long time must be raised.</p>
<p>(3) Constructive efforts must be made to remove the current restrictions hindering trade, such as high tariffs, import bans, and import quotas.</p>
<p>(4) The central banks of several countries must act jointly to expand lending, and this lending must be fluid and not stagnant.</p>
<p>There are many other issues discussed, such as improving the status of silver in currency, which is one aspect. However, the communique did not mention any practical suggestions on these issues and it is said that they will continue to be discussed at the London Conference. At present, the British experts will remain in Washington to complete the unfinished matters entrusted to them by the two executives. It is claimed that silver is also one of them, and the value of gold and the status of silver in the future will be the main issues in the continued meetings of British and American experts in Washington for several days. In addition to attempting to agree on a monetary standard that can be accepted by all countries, the experts also want to find an international exchange plan to relieve each country of the management of its foreign exchange. The experts of both countries believe that the free flow of foreign exchange is necessary for the recovery of the economy, but it is not easy to find a perfect method to guarantee free flow. Although the talks between the British and American executives and the issued communique have tended to alleviate the anxiety of Americans about the economic situation, the American people still feel quite disappointed because no formal points of agreement have been published. Although the authorities stated at the beginning of the talks that the purpose of this visit was to explore avenues, most people still hoped for a frank agreement on war debts and the international gold standard. Today, the White House solemnly stated that after the United States obtained the cooperation of Britain, a perfect foundation has been laid, and great achievements can be expected at the London Conference in the future. However, it also stated that the United States seeks friendly understanding in the proceedings of the London Conference, and does not intend to form an alliance with other countries. The American newspapers almost unanimously supported the President's and the British Prime Minister's efforts to solve the problems discussed. Today's commentaries mostly said that even if only one of the proposals is completely successful at the London Conference, today's talks are of incalculable value. It also said that meetings on monetary standards have been held many times before, but have not achieved lasting results. The current meeting has another opportunity to achieve a very successful undertaking because when they go to the meeting, they already know that some countries will have to make some sacrifices. If they want to change the situation, the United States must also make some sacrifices. (26th Guomin Telegram)</p>

<p>(Washington) British Prime Minister MacDonald issued a declaration to the press, saying that the results of his talks with President Roosevelt were much greater than he had hoped when he arrived in the United States, but no compromise was reached between Britain and the United States. (I have not made any promises, and I am free to act, just as I was when I first arrived in the United States, but President Roosevelt and I have indeed done good work.) MacDonald's declaration was issued before the French representative Herriot had another meeting with President Roosevelt. MacDonald departed for New York at noon today and took the (Berengaria) liner back to England at 11:00 PM, and sent a telegram to President Roosevelt when he departed, thanking him for his kindness.

<p>(Washington) After Roosevelt and Herriot saw MacDonald off to return to England, they immediately began to discuss the Consultative Pact, monetary standards, and disarmament issues. However, because Roosevelt's previous talks with MacDonald had been fully disclosed to Herriot, the talks between Luo and He could save a lot of time at this time. When MacDonald left Washington, rumors immediately spread that the US President had guaranteed that the United States would sign the Consultative Pact in exchange for large-scale disarmament. Regarding the statement made by US representative Davis yesterday at the Geneva Disarmament Conference that the United States supports the policy of mutual consultation, but the wording of the mutual consultation clause in the British draft is too strict, the State Department today neither confirmed nor denied it when asked, but it is rumored that Davis's statement seemed to have been approved by the State Department.

<p>(New York) The New York Times, in an article discussing the Washington talks and Roosevelt's new approach to Britain and France, stated that, judging from Roosevelt's recent approach to Britain and France, the United States may inevitably conclude agreements with other countries to jointly deal with aggressive nations. The Hearst newspapers are most fearful of Roosevelt being drawn into international entanglements and becoming an advocate of internationalism. Judging from the situation of this talk, the worries of the Hearst faction may finally come true. The foreign policy of the United States has always been not to interfere in European affairs, but now the reason for changing course is that the domestic economy is unbearable. The US economy is affected by the global panic. If the domestic economy is to recover, world prices must first be raised and world currencies must first be stabilized. This is something that the US cannot achieve alone. However, if Roosevelt raises these two issues with Herriot and demands French cooperation, Herriot will inevitably propose disarmament and security construction as exchange conditions. Once security is involved, the issue of sanctioning aggressor countries will naturally be raised as well. (Havas News Agency, 26th)</p>

<p>(Washington) The Senate today passed the amended version of the inflation bill proposed by Senators Wheeler and King. In addition to granting the US President the power to reinstate silver coinage at any gold-silver ratio he deems necessary, it also advocates the unlimited coinage of gold and silver coins. This amendment was passed by a vote of 41 to 26. The Senate then decided to limit the debate on the inflation plan. Democrat Robinson proposed that after 2 PM today, each senator be limited to fifteen minutes for the entire rural relief bill and for amendments to this bill. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The US Senate, knowing that the President may not fully utilize the powers granted by Congress, suddenly passed Wheeler's free coinage of silver bill today by a vote of 41 to 26. This bill was originally based on Briand's proposal, stipulating a gold-silver ratio of 16 to 1, but it has now been amended to allow the President to decide the ratio. Today's action by the Senate occurred suddenly, and there was no prior indication that it would receive so much support. It is known that many Republican senators favor using silver coins to inflate the currency, but opinions have always differed greatly within Congress on how to improve the status of silver. According to those close to the President, Roosevelt may not see the need to order the opening of silver coins. This statement has not been denied by those close to the government, indicating that the United States may not take the lead in opening the path to bimetallism before other countries have fully studied it. However, the passage of this bill by the Senate also demonstrates the Senate's attitude towards inflating the currency and improving the monetary status of silver. The bill has now been sent to the House of Representatives, and Speaker Rayburn expects it to be passed within a few days. (National Telegram, 26th)</p>

<p>Severely Criticizes Lytton for Treating Japanese Like Indians</p>
<p>Compromise Objectives Not Achieved, Regrets for Life</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese representative Matsuoka Yosuke arrived in Tokyo at 3:05 PM today. At 12:45 PM, he broadcasted a message from the ship, stating that he was returning home because of his limited ability, and he was very sorry to the people of the country. At this time, he did not dare to say much about right and wrong. Japan wanted to compromise with the League of Nations and sent him to Geneva. As a result, because the goal was not achieved, he resolutely broke with the League of Nations. He returned home empty-handed. Because of the withdrawal from the League of Nations, a new situation has been created in the Far East. The Japanese people must unite more closely to complete the new mission. The person he hates most is Lytton. Lytton is the son of the Governor-General of India. He was born in India and is a British official in India. He despises Indians and is unwilling to treat our Asian nations equally. Moreover, he compares the Japanese with the British, and always stands on a high platform to judge Asian nations. He deeply regrets this for the British. In order to break through the current difficult situation, it is necessary to form a unified force with the military. It is reported that Matsuoka received a Japanese sword of the Yamato nation from his mother before leaving the country. This time, he actually brought back the original item and returned the sword to his mother. As a result, some people commented that Matsuoka is still a wise gentleman who knows when to advance and retreat. (China United Press, 27th)</p>

<h3 id="e37">A Respectful Message to the Education Community <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the mutiny, the invaders have penetrated deeper and the national situation has become more dangerous. When the disaster first occurred, the education community was filled with excitement and generosity, and showed a spirit of vigor for a time. However, today I cannot help but discuss with the gentlemen of the education community again that the people of the country have often said that the current national crisis is partly due to the evil consequences of decades of (new education). If this statement is true, and it truly comes from a deep remorse of the people, then we should ask ourselves today how the education after the September 18th Incident compares to the education before the September 18th Incident. In other words, has the education after the September 18th Incident gained practical improvements from the painful lessons?</p>
<p>In extraordinary times, there should be education for extraordinary times. Our country is now facing extraordinary times. During this period, education at all levels across the country should be changed. In terms of moral education, the awakening of national consciousness and the recognition of imperialism should be the main focus. In terms of academic knowledge, practical sciences related to war should be the main focus. With the slogan of (national revolutionary war), the youth and students of the whole country should be mobilized to prepare for a desperate struggle to maintain national survival. The Japanese imperialists have long implemented militaristic education, and today they are also preparing for the general mobilization of the youth of the whole country. If our country today is still as usual, with scholars learning what they learn and teachers teaching what they teach, or even confined to the scope of (foreign eight-legged essays) regardless of actual needs, then the fruits of this kind of education in the future can be known.</p>
<p>Judging from the current facts, we cannot admit that the education after the September 18th Incident is any different from the education before the September 18th Incident, and that it has gained any improvements after receiving the painful lessons of the September 18th Incident. What is particularly painful is that most people today still treat young people as tools or as a terrible flood, regarding them as tools and using them at every turn, or regarding them as floods and being wary of them at all times. As a result, students are gradually heading towards the path of depression or turning into politicians. Those who have a little enthusiasm are wrong no matter what they do. Moreover, those who witness the difficulties of the times and are willing to be friends with young people are also subject to jealousy and suspicion, and are regarded as having other motives or other attempts. Furthermore, in the education community itself, they are separated from each other and do not conspire with each other, and few are willing to consider the responsibilities they should bear today. They do not realize that they are covered in wounds, and they are not moved when disaster strikes. This is what we can lament and should think deeply about today.</p>
<p>Young people are the lifeline of the country, and education is the foundation of the country. The future of our nation can be predicted based on today's education. Since past education is recognized as having yielded some evil consequences, then what about today? All the ills of our country are due to numbness and insensitivity, and the numbness of the education community is the root of all ills. The gentlemen of the education community across the country should think deeply about this.</p>
<p>Conflict of Interest between US and Japan over Pacific Mandated Islands</p>
<h3 id="e38">Will Be the Focus of Debate in Washington Talks <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) According to extremely reliable sources, President Roosevelt of the United States and Viscount Ishii of Japan will meet in Washington next month to hold discussions on economic and disarmament issues. At that time, Japan's ruling territories in the South Pacific will be one of the most important topics of discussion. It is said that the United States will refute Japan's claim to have the right to annex 1,600 small islands mandated by the League of Nations. Furthermore, the various issues that Roosevelt has already discussed with British Prime Minister MacDonald and former French Prime Minister Herriot will be renegotiated with Ishii. However, the conflict of interest over disarmament issues and the issue of ruling territories is more important than all other issues. The United States previously intended to adopt a laissez-faire attitude towards Japan's claim to various annexation rights, because no technical difficulties would arise before Japan actually withdrew from the League of Nations, and the United States could make a statement to protect its interests when the State Department felt doubts. However, now that the issue of ruling territories has become unavoidable due to the discussion of disarmament issues, it is necessary to resolve it as soon as possible. As for the United States' view on the sovereignty of the islands ruled by Japan, it is reported that the United States will not only dispute Japan's nominal sovereignty, but also study whether Japan should continue to administer them after it has withdrawn from the League of Nations. Because the United States believes that it also has various interests within the Pacific mandated area, which are equal to those of Britain and France in other parts of the world. These areas were all seized from Germany by the joint efforts of the Allied powers, and not by the efforts of Japan alone. Therefore, the Allied powers today have common interests and common powers to decide the disposal of these lands. Furthermore, the United States' view did not start today. Not long after the end of the European War, the United States was the first to publish this theory. What can be cited today is that the then US Secretary of State Colbert stated in the League of Nations Council on February 21, 1921 (these German-owned lands were transferred to the main countries of the Allied Group, namely the United States, Britain, France, Italy and Japan, by the Treaty of Versailles). Colbert also said that (since the United States is one of the main countries of the Allied Group, the United States has the same relationship and inseparable interests as other major countries in disposing of these German-owned overseas territories, and no disposal method can be implemented without the consent of the United States). Most recently, on July 8, 1932, the United States also stated in a memorandum submitted by Britain regarding Iraq's being raised as an independent member of the League of Nations (in order to avoid future misunderstandings, the United States hereby declares that it wishes to submit a complete reservation, that is, the United States' failure to insist on the implementation of its interests today shall not be considered as the United States having abandoned the principles it established in 1921, that is, the legal consent of the United States is an indispensable condition for the disposal of each ruling territory). The term "ruling territory" here actually refers to any ruling territory, and the United States has special rights to the Japanese-ruled territory in the Pacific, as detailed in the Japan-US treaty signed on February 1, 1922. There are many detailed records on this issue, such as Chapter 5, Section 11, which states (everything contained in this treaty shall not be affected by the restrictions of the ruling rights mentioned in this treaty, unless it has been agreed to by the United States (National Telegram, 26th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the selection of Chinese representatives to the World Economic Conference, it is reported that the government plans to have Song Ziwen take on the role of attending the conference nearby after the Washington economic talks are completed. Because the time difference is only a few weeks, it would not be easy to send another senior official to arrive on schedule. Moreover, the Washington talks and the World Economic Conference are related, so having Song attend will be easier.

<p>Russian Newspaper Reveals Japanese Conspiracy to Seize the Chinese Eastern Railway</p>
<h3 id="e40">Management Rights of the Eastern Railway are Controlled by the Japanese Consul in Harbin, Plans are Being Drawn Up to Actively Exclude Soviet Interests, the Russian Side Sends a Letter to the Pseudo-National Leader for Diplomatic Resolution The Chinese Eastern Railway Club is Completely Destroyed by Fire <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>(Moscow) A newspaper here today carried a message from Boli, revealing the Japanese conspiracy regarding the Chinese Eastern Railway. It is said that (according to reliable sources, the (Manchu) management rights in the Chinese Eastern Railway Council are now controlled by Morishima, the Japanese Consul General in Harbin. All the violent acts of cutting off traffic between the Chinese Eastern Railway and the Outer Baikal Railway, the official letter signed by the pseudo-Manchu diplomat Shi Liben and sent to the Soviet Consul General in Harbin, Slavsky, and the official letter from Li Shaogeng, Chairman of the Chinese Eastern Railway Council, to Vice Chairman Koznivev, were actually initiated by Morishima. It is also reported that the Japanese groups in Manchuria have drafted a plan of action on the Chinese Eastern Railway and submitted it to the headquarters of the Kwantung Army for approval. The plan advocates excluding Soviet rights on the Chinese Eastern Railway and seizing the railway by the Japanese on the pretext of transferring it to the pseudo-Manchu state. According to this plan, the actual intention is to undermine the Sino-Russian and Fengtian-Russian agreements, disrupt the work of the railway, paralyze freight transport between the Outer Baikal and Ussuri railways and the Chinese Eastern Railway, and prevent the Soviet Union from gaining a foothold on the Chinese Eastern Railway. Another part of this plan is to accuse the director of the Chinese Eastern Railway, Rudy, of recognizing the Soviet Union's detention of Chinese Eastern Railway locomotives with absolutely baseless accusations. In short, the actual purpose of this anti-Soviet attack is to seize the Chinese Eastern Railway and include it in the Manchuria Railway under Japanese rule). The Soviet government's bulletin (Ivans Stais) commented on this matter today, saying (This news has caused the Soviet Union to be alarmed about the situation of the Chinese Eastern Railway. However, if the enthusiasm of the Japanese officials in northern Manchuria leads them to take such adventurous or provocative actions, the Soviet Union hopes that the Japanese government is not aware of it. The Japanese government has the responsibility not to undermine Soviet rights on the Chinese Eastern Railway. This is what the Soviet Union hopes. However, the Japanese representative in Harbin cannot conceal his intentions even if he is playing hide-and-seek. Therefore, the Soviet Union's public opinion earnestly hopes that the Japanese government can at this time instruct its officials in Harbin not to take dangerous and irresponsible actions and not to allow them to undermine the Sino-Russian and Fengtian-Russian agreements).

<p>(Harbin) Yesterday, bandits demolished the railway tracks near Shahe, causing a track maintenance car carrying a large team of workers to derail and overturn. The bandits not only threw bombs at the train, but also fired machine guns at the people in the car. One worker was killed and five were injured, and nine were kidnapped. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Newspapers here are now paying more attention to the Chinese Eastern Railway dispute. Today, they published a telegram from Boli, saying that Japanese officials in northern Manchuria have planned to eliminate Russian management rights on the Chinese Eastern Railway and seize the railway. Russian newspapers said that the Soviet Union hopes that the Japanese government will reprimand its officials in Harbin as soon as possible to avoid undermining</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the plan to establish a provincial governor system, the Ministry of Internal Affairs has studied it in detail and has basically decided to submit it to the Executive Yuan. The contents can be divided into the following points: 1. When establishing a provincial governor system, administrative expenses should be reduced and operating expenses should be increased. 2. Concentrate the inspectors of the various departments in the provincial governor's office in order to unify the power. All existing administrative commissioners should work in the office and be dispatched to various counties when necessary. There is no need to set up a higher-level agency. 3. In order to unify the power, it is planned to change the current four departments of civil affairs, finance, education, and industry into four divisions. 4. It is planned to add a director of political affairs to assist the provincial governor in handling provincial affairs, similar to the various ministries, and to establish a system of vice ministers of political affairs. 5. The provincial governor should absolutely be a civilian. (Special Telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>Japan Sets Up a Radio Station in Hankou</p>
<h3 id="e43">The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Protests to Japan for Unauthorized Change of Name of Changchun Radio Bureau <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) In the camp of the Japanese Marine Corps in Hankou, there was previously a shortwave radio station. Later, on March 28, a longwave radio station was added. There are also two shortwave radio stations, one in the consulate and one in the Mitsui Foreign Firm, which privately communicate with Changchun and Tokyo. Furthermore, the Japanese Telegraph Administration arbitrarily changed the name of the Changchun Japanese Radio Bureau to (Xinjing). All of these actions infringe upon China's telegraph privileges and violate the Sino-Japanese Telegraph Agreement. It is now reported that the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a note to the Japanese Ambassador to China on April 25, lodging a protest, stating that all matters concerning the operation of wireless telecommunications businesses within China, and the permission for others to operate such businesses or to send and receive wireless telecommunications, are the exclusive prerogative of the Chinese nation. At the Washington Conference in December of the tenth year of the Republic of China, China solemnly declared that it would not recognize any wireless stations installed in China by foreigners without the consent of the Chinese government. Now the Japanese Marine Corps has arbitrarily set up a radio station in Hankou and privately communicates with Changchun and other places, which seriously infringes upon the rights of the national telecommunications government. Moreover, the Japanese Telegraph Administration changed the name of the radio bureau without the consent of the Chinese side, which clearly violates Article 3 of the Sino-Japanese Telegraph Agreement. The Chinese government cannot recognize it. We hereby lodge a protest and ask you to forward it to your government to stop the illegal activities of the Japanese Marine Corps and the Japanese Telegraph Administration mentioned above.

<p>(Nanjing) The Constitution Drafting Committee held its twelfth meeting at 2:00 PM on the 27th. 26 committee members attended, including Jiao Yitang. Sun Ke chaired the meeting. Matters discussed included: (1) The issue of the organization of the constitution. It was resolved that it be determined by the original drafter. (2) The issue of the organization of the National Assembly. It was resolved that the National Assembly of the Republic of China be organized by electing representatives in the following ways: (A) County elections: each county and its equivalent area shall elect one representative. (B) City elections: each city shall elect one representative for every 300,000 inhabitants. (Central News Agency Telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Furthermore, because the Central Standing Committee has a proposal to convene the National Assembly ahead of schedule, the constitution must be completed as early as possible. The procedures for drafting the constitution have been changed. The research period, originally scheduled for six months, has now been advanced to the end of this month. The twelfth meeting of the committee held on the 27th was the last meeting of the research period. From May 1st to June 30th, it will be the first draft period. During the discussion period, the meetings of the Constitutional Drafting Committee and its subcommittees will be suspended. The main drafters of the first draft are Zhang Zhiben, Wu Jingxiong, Jiao Yitang, Ma Yinchu, Chen Zhaoying, Fu Bingchang, and Wu Shangying. The drafting period is one month. Wu Jingxiong will complete the full text of the first draft of the constitution, and then submit it to the main drafters to hold a subcommittee meeting to discuss it for one month, and then submit it to the committee for discussion.

<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan has concluded the research period of the constitution, and May will be the first draft period. The main drafter of the first draft, Wu Jingxiong, told reporters on the 27th that although the main parts of the constitution have been largely decided during the constitution research period of less than two months, there are still many issues, such as national livelihood, that have not been studied. It has been decided to leave it to the original drafter to carefully draft the new draft constitution. The new draft constitution is planned to be divided into three sections: national, civil, and livelihood. All matters concerning raising the national status, promoting the national spirit, and consolidating national unity fall under the national section. Raising the national status, protecting the rights of the people, and restricting the government from abusing its powers fall under the civil section. Protecting the people's economic interests, maintaining the people's livelihood, developing industry, and popularizing national education and vocations fall under the livelihood section. The usual constitution does not go beyond stipulating the political system and the rights and obligations of the people, that is, restricting capital and equalizing land ownership. The German constitution already has this meaning. It is still unprecedented in other countries to divide it into sections such as national, civil, and livelihood. I am responsible for the first draft, and I will take it seriously in order to achieve success. As for the location of the first draft, it will be in Beijing. (Central News Agency Telegram, 27th)</p>

<p>New Situation in Disarmament Conference: U.S. Representative Makes First Formal Declaration</p>
<h3 id="e90">Disarmament Convention Should Stipulate Consultation Procedures, British Representative Proposes Acceptance of Chinese Amendments <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>▲Havas Agency, Geneva, 26th: At the Disarmament Conference, the US representative Davis declared to the General Committee this afternoon that the US government felt there was a new situation that should be stipulated in the disarmament convention, the procedures of mutual consultation by the related countries in the case of a violation of the Paris Anti-War Pact. The US wanted that countries, whether or not members of the League of Nations, should strive to maintain peace. This declaration made a very good impression at the meeting.</p>
<p>▲US Advocates Two Points</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Geneva, 26th: US representative Davis made his first formal declaration to the Disarmament Conference General Committee on the disarmament issue today. Several parties regard the US representative's declaration as a precursor to the US presenting more practical disarmament proposals soon. Davis clearly stated the US's desire to cooperate in maintaining peace, saying that the US is prepared to make various great efforts to assist this. The US deeply believes that all countries in the world, especially those in Europe, now want to reduce their arms levels for the first time. He now advocates two things: (1) abolishing offensive weapons; (2) stipulating continuous monitoring. Regarding the second matter, it is appropriate to make the monitoring plans already proposed by various countries more powerful. Davis concluded by saying that the US will have a more precise expression of its best efforts to cooperate in due course.</p>
<p>▲Accepting Our Amendments</p>
<p>The General Committee continued its meeting in the afternoon, resolving to delete the first article of the British disarmament draft. British representative Eden proposed that the committee should accept China's amendments to the draft and form a new amended text, immediately after the fifth article. As of yesterday, Chinese representative Gu Weijun submitted the following amendments: (The signatory countries who are also members of the League of Nations hereby declare that the existing form of the convention does not prejudice the rights and obligations of the members of the League of Nations, nor does it conflict with the powers of the Executive Yuan under the League Covenant.) Eden also proposed accepting China's amendments to Article 4, modifying the number (using war or force to resolve international disputes) to intensify the restrictions on the use of force. It was then decided to hold a main body meeting tomorrow morning, and the next General Committee meeting was scheduled for Friday, when representatives from various countries will submit amendments to the second part of the draft. ▲British Plan Continues Discussion</p>
<p>▲Havas, Geneva, 27th: The Presidium of the Disarmament Conference held a meeting this morning, chaired by Henderson, and resolved to recommend to the General Committee that the first part of the British disarmament plan be postponed for discussion, and that the second part be put forward for discussion first. According to the suggestion of French representative Massigli, the number of committees should speed up their work. The French representative also advocated that the General Assembly elect a special committee, chaired by Greek representative Politis, to study the French proposal for a European mutual assistance pact. This proposal was also passed, and the committee will begin its work soon.</p>

<p>▲Reuters, The Hague, 26th: The Dutch Cabinet submitted its resignation to the Queen today. The Queen instructed the cabinet members to maintain the status quo as usual. According to current Prime Minister Pieter Sjoerds Gerbrandy, who has been in power since 1929, until today, the recent reason for this was the Lower House's opposition to his economic proposals, and the Social Democratic Party's opposition to handling the mutiny of the Dutch warship Zeven Provinciën. It is expected that the result of the future election will be the establishment of a strong government through the cooperation of various religious groups.</p>

<p>▲Reuters, Berlin, 26th: According to political circles, there will be important changes in the German cabinet very soon. It is believed that Foreign Minister Neurath and Agriculture Minister Hugenberg will both leave the cabinet. Neurath because his policies lack careful consideration, and Hugenberg because he is too capitalist and has lost the original intention of the National Socialist Party. Vice Chancellor Papen is said to be the Foreign Minister. The split of the Steel Helmet League, due to the dismissal of Deputy Commander Duesterberg, was fortunately recovered. Duesterberg said that his resignation was really for the sake of the future of the Steel Helmet League. Duesterberg advised the remaining members to do the same and faithfully follow Hitler's guidance.</p>

<p>▲Havas Agency, Aix-en-Provence, France, 26th: The sensational Blood Chest Case is being heard by the criminal court here. The details of the case are as follows: Last year, a chest was discovered near here containing a corpse, identified as overseas Chinese Xu Xiangqing (transliteration). After investigation by the police, the criminals Zhang Laiyou, Fu Shanji, and Zhang Hanya (all transliterations), all friends of the deceased, were arrested. Zhang Hanya and two others died of tuberculosis in Marseille prison. Only Zhang Laiyou remains, charged with complicity in murder. Laiyou is short, skinny, and dying. Everyone believes that this case will probably end by itself before the trial. At the hearing today, Zhang Laiyou's testimony was interpreted by an interpreter. The judge first reviewed the facts of the case. The victim in this case was a peddler of odds and ends who earned a lot of profit. Zhang Laiyou, Fu Shanji, and Zhang Hanya knew that he had a lot of savings, so they lured him to a certain place and killed him. According to the defendant's confession, Fu Shanji killed him with a hammer, and before Fu Shanji died, he said that Xu Xiangqing threatened him with a pistol, and he had to defend himself. The judge asked Zhang Laiyou if this was the case, and Zhang Laiyou replied that the murder weapon was not purchased by him. When the incident happened, he was sleeping at home, and Fu and others suddenly came and told him what had happened. Fearing involvement in the case, he fled with Fu and others. The court determined that Zhang Laiyou was guilty of complicity in murder and theft and sentenced him to 20 years in prison.</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Change Harassment Tactics</p>
<h3 id="e94">Japanese Troops Secretly Moved North from Luandong, Concentrating Forces to Attack Nantianmen <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>A special dispatch from Beiping states that after the Japanese army occupied Luandong, they turned to attack Nantianmen, threatening Beiping and Tianjin. It was originally hoped that they could quickly capture the Nantianmen fortress to attack Miyun and disrupt the rear of Beiping and Tianjin, trapping our eastern army in a heavy siege. Fortunately, our army resisted bravely, fighting fiercely for four or five days and nights without the enemy succeeding. Furthermore, due to heavy casualties, the original forces were feeling inadequate. Therefore, they changed their strategy, transferring all the Japanese troops from Luandong to the north to reinforce their position. The Luandong area was temporarily guarded by the puppet army of Li Jichun. At the same time, they declared to the outside world that they had no intention of invading beyond the Great Wall, withdrawing from the Great Wall to confuse international opinion. Their plan is truly cunning. The Japanese army's transfer from northern Luandong began around the 30th. By dawn on the 23rd, all Japanese troops from the Qian'an and Lulong areas had been completely withdrawn. During the withdrawal, they occasionally bombarded our positions with field guns, creating a false impression of attempting to cross the river and advance, to prevent us from discovering the truth. Unexpectedly, on the evening of the 22nd, a unit of puppet troops surrendered to Gao Guizi's army, leaking the secret. Gao then commanded his troops to cross the river and launch a counterattack on the morning of the 23rd, and they soon recovered Qian'an. The He and Wang armies, upon hearing the news, also coordinated to advance. The Wang army occupied Lulong, and the He army advanced to Anshan. This morning (25th), the He army has approached Changli. The Gao and Wang armies are also gradually advancing north from Qian'an and Lulong. Currently, order has been restored in Qian'an and Lulong, and personnel from various agencies are returning from Beiping and Tianjin to their counties to work. A unit of the Japanese army is deploying defenses in the Jianchangying area, only a few dozen miles away from our army. It is expected that a temporary stalemate will form in that area.</p>
<p>On the Gubeikou front, after the Japanese army occupied Koumen, our army guarded the Nantianmen, Badaolouzi, and two gun tower positions, surrounding Gubeikou on three sides, forming a semi-circle. The Nantianmen front position is in a dangerous location and has strong defenses. Badaolouzi is on the left flank of Nantianmen, one times higher than Nantianmen, forming a mutually supporting formation. There are eight artillery towers on it, hence the name Badaolouzi (Eight Tower Buildings). The gain or loss of this location is extremely important. The Japanese army began its attack at dawn on the 21st, adopting a strategy of flanking from the left and right, launching a combined attack of infantry, artillery, and air force on the Badaolouzi, two gun tower, and Longtangou areas. The battle for Badaolouzi was particularly fierce. The positions were gained and lost five or six times in four or five days and nights of bloody fighting. Our army killed over three thousand enemy soldiers. Our army lost two battalion commanders and three were wounded. Soldiers casualties numbered three to four thousand. The fighting remained extremely fierce yesterday (24th) and today (25th). At 6:00 AM yesterday, the enemy used six aircraft and concentrated artillery fire to bombard the left flank of Nantianmen, and over two thousand infantrymen launched attacks on Nantianmen and our left flank. The two sides engaged in fierce fighting, with hand-to-hand combat occurring five or six times. Around 10:00 AM, our left flank suffered heavy casualties and was also under pressure from a large number of enemy reinforcements. The left flank position was once lost, but a certain unit was mobilized to launch a brave counterattack, charging five times. At 12:00 PM, they repelled the enemy and regained the original position. At 3:00 PM in the afternoon, the Japanese army launched another large-scale attack on our front. Our army responded calmly, and the enemy did not succeed. At night, the enemy bombarded us with heavy artillery, and the sound of artillery fire continued all night. All the towers were completely destroyed. The Japanese army launched another charge this morning and are currently engaged in fierce fighting. The Japanese army's intention is to break through the Nantianmen position, advance on Miyun, and threaten Beiping and Tianjin. (April 25th)</p>
<p>Fu Zuoyi and Others Arrive in Gan</p>
<h3 id="e95">Conferring with Chiang on Emergency Anti-Japanese Military Affairs, Wu Jingheng and Li Yuying Also Arrive in Gan <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>A dispatch from Nanchang states that representatives from the Jin, Sui, and Chahar armies, Fu Zuoyi; representatives from the Northeast generals, Zhang Xueming; and representatives from the Beiping Military Affairs Commission, Zhu Guangmu, arrived in Gan with important missions to pay respects to Chairman Chiang. They arrived in Xun on the 24th from Ping and immediately took a special train to the province. They arrived at Nanchang Station at 12:00 PM. The General Headquarters and the Provincial Government both sent liaison officers to the station to welcome and take care of them. After Fu and others crossed the river into the city, they took cars to the Science Museum to meet with Chiang. They reported in detail on the anti-Japanese military situation and represented the military and civilians of North China in requesting Chiang to go north immediately to take unified command to save the critical situation. It is reported that Chiang expressed his appreciation to the officers and soldiers fighting in North China and promised to go north in the shortest possible time. He also gave instructions on the combat plan for the Luan River and the Great Wall, as well as the defense of Beiping and Tianjin. Fu and others telegraphed the situation of their meeting with Chiang to senior military officers in North China that evening. It is reported that Chiang will convene He Guoguang, He Chengjun, and senior staff at the headquarters to further discuss military matters in order to make urgent responses. According to sources at the headquarters, Chiang has decided to increase the deployment of fresh troops to various lines due to the urgency of the military situation in North China. As for the timing of Chiang's trip north, it may have to be slightly delayed because the Red bandits have recently concentrated their main forces in the upper reaches of the Fu River in Yile, repeatedly attacking Fu. This is because the Guangdong and Guangxi armies have not fired a single arrow or bullet at the pseudo-central area of the Red bandits in Yudu, Xingguo, and Ruijin, allowing the bandits to have no worries about their rear. Therefore, Chiang has been urging Chen Jitang and Li Zongren to implement the suppression of the bandits and not to hesitate any longer. The written and telegraphic communications are as urgent as shooting stars. At the same time, he also telegraphed Cai Tingkai in Guangdong, strongly arguing the advantages and disadvantages of suppressing the bandits, so as to avoid mutual destruction. Currently, the anti-Japanese military situation urgently relies on Chiang's leadership in the north. The timing of Chiang's trip north depends on whether the suppression of the Red bandits can be abandoned. Whether the suppression of the Red bandits can be abandoned depends on whether Guangdong and Guangxi are willing to send a large number of troops to Gan to assist in the suppression, so as to attack the bandits' rear. If Chen and Li are willing to send a large number of troops to attack Yudu and Xingguo, and simultaneously act with Fujian, Jiangxi, and Hunan, then the encirclement will be complete. The suppression of the Red bandits will not be a problem, and Chiang can immediately go north to fight the Japanese. This is what is meant by the southwest being fully responsible for the suppression of the Red bandits, and the central government being fully responsible for the anti-Japanese war.</p>
<p>Wu Zhihui and Li Shizeng arrived in Jiujiang from Beijing on the 25th and immediately took the Nanxun Railway to the province. After getting off the train, they took a ferry across the river and then switched to cars to rush to the Science Museum to meet with Chairman Chiang. It is reported that they were discussing the temporary meeting of the Kuomintang and the anti-Japanese military situation, and plan to stay for one or two days before returning to Beijing.

<p>A dispatch from Guangzhou states that the advance detachments of the 19th Route Army's anti-Japanese troops have departed for northern Guangdong Province to concentrate in Beijiang. The two detachments arrived in Xingning from Meixian and then traveled south from Xingmi, taking the route through Pingling. They arrived in Longmen County on the 16th. All sectors of Longmen County held a meeting to welcome them on the 17th, with over two thousand participants. On the 19th, the two detachments continued to advance from Longmen, passing through Lianglukou in Conghua, detouring to Fogang, and going straight to Yingde. Then, they took the Yue-Shao Railway to [ ] [ ] for concentration. In addition to dispatching the [ ] detachment commander Zhang Yan to Beijiang to inspect the troops at that time, and dispatching the [ ] detachment commander Tan Qixiu to Guangzhou to preside over the local camp of the 19th Route Army's Anti-Japanese Vanguard, Cai Tingkai has been discussing anti-Japanese and anti-communist matters with Chen Jitang in recent days. It is reported that Chen and Cai have decided on specific plans for marching and supplies, which can be implemented in the short term. Yesterday, Cai summoned the two detachment commanders Zhang Yan and Tan Qixiu, the 61st Division Commander of the 19th Route Army Mao Weishou, and personnel from the army's representative office in Guangdong to discuss issues such as the replenishment of grain and weapons for the army's vanguard. Regarding the organization of the 19th Route Army Anti-Japanese Vanguard Headquarters, the third floor of the Huizhou Guild Hall in Guangzhou has been selected as the office location.

<p>Chen and Peng share a room. When reporters visited, the two had just returned to the detention center from court. They were smoking and reading newspapers in the room, wearing short coats and their heads uncovered, and their attitude was very relaxed. The room contained two beds, a table, and a bookshelf, which were full of social science books, resembling the dormitory life of a university student. Upon seeing the reporters, both of them stood up and greeted them with smiles, as if welcoming the arrival of friends, making it hard to believe that they were prisoners.</p>

<p>When asked about their thoughts after the verdict, Chen replied, "The court's decision is exactly what we expected, so there is nothing surprising about it." After saying this, a dim smile was exchanged on his dark face. Peng replied, "We were sentenced for violating Article 6 and Article 2, Section 2 of the Emergency Law on Punishing Those Who Endanger the Republic of China, but we have never been able to find any serious facts of treason in our past actions. The group exercising the power to rule can never be regarded as the country." The reporter asked, "Are you both preparing to appeal?" Chen replied, "After the judgment is officially served, we will appeal to the extent possible. As for whether to ask the original lawyers to defend us, we have not yet thought about it."

<p>The Lunantai Weir Road in Southern Shandong is About to Be Completed</p>
<h3 id="e101">Connecting the Jinpu, Jiaoji, Longhai, and Yanwei Roads, the Weixian-Juxian Section Has Been Completed and Opened to Traffic <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>A dispatch from Jinan states that the Jinpu Road runs vertically through Shandong Province from north to south, and the Jiaoji Road runs from Qingdao to Jinan, connecting with the Jinpu Road, forming a T-shape, making north-south and east-west transportation fairly convenient. Since the year before last, the Department of Construction has been actively expanding motor vehicle roads, and the eastern, western, and northern Shandong lines, extending in all directions, have been completed. Southern Shandong is more difficult to build due to the complex mountain ranges and has not yet been built. However, the Taizhuang-Weixian line has long been surveyed and planned. This line can connect the Jinpu, Jiaoji, Longhai, and Yanwei roads, which has a significant relationship with commerce and culture. The Taiyi District Motor Vehicle Road Bureau of the Department of Construction was ordered to start construction last year. So far, the Weixian-Juxian section has been completed first and opened to traffic on the 24th of this month. It is also being built westward to Taierzhuang. The entire line is 800 miles long, passing through Linyi, Juxian, Zhucheng, and Anqiu. The road surface is more than four meters wide (one meter wider than the Yanwei Road). There are many bridges along the way. If permanent bridges are built, it will cost 1.5 million yuan. The cost of building temporary bridges is also 810,000 yuan. The provincial government has approved that the money will be temporarily advanced by the local area and reimbursed later. It is expected that it will take 11 hours to reach Taizhuang when the Taizhuang-Weixian line opens to traffic. If the bridges are repaired, it will only take 9 hours. If guests from the south want to go to Yantai or Qingdao, they no longer need to detour through Jinan. They can get off the train at Xin'anzhen on the Longhai Road, take a car through Tancheng to Linyi, and then take the Taiwei car to Weixian to go to Qingdao or Yantai, which is very convenient. The Jinpu Road has a branch line in Lincheng that passes through Zaozhuang to Taizhuang (the Zao-Tai section currently only transports coal). If passenger cars are allowed, passengers on the Jinpu Road can get off at Taizhuang, take the Taiwei car to Weixian in the morning, and take the Yanwei car to Yantai, arriving at 8:00 PM. Traveling through half of Shandong Province for 1,400 miles will only take this shortest time, which saves a day compared to detouring through Jinan. It can be said to be extremely convenient. The car fare for each line of motor vehicle road in this province is generally from 2.5 to 3 cents per mile. Now, Wang Yimin, director of the Taiyi District Motor Vehicle Road Bureau, has submitted to the Department of Construction for approval to reduce the car fare on the Taiwei Road to 2 cents per mile. The current car fare for the Weixian-Juxian section that has opened to traffic is 7.7 yuan. If the entire line is completed, it will cost more than 15 yuan, which is more economical than other lines. This road has a major mission for the future commercial and cultural development of southern Shandong. (April 25th)</p>

He used a towel to wrap her face and raped her three times. Later, police detectives from Wujiang County arrested Hong in Wuxi. After interrogation, he confessed to committing numerous crimes, including tying up and raping Tangshi and others. The record of the confession was submitted to the High Court, which requested the provincial government to pass a resolution to secretly order the original county to carry out the execution by shooting. The county then bound the prisoner and took him to the outside of the east gate of Wujiang County for execution by shooting at 9:00 AM on the 27th.</p>

Now, he has been hired by the Shanghai Gongji Opera Company to perform on stage in the play specially written by the company, "Lu Genrong Joins the Army and Captures the Fleeing General," and personally reports on the love affair of the Huang-Lu case. Currently, all the members of the company have come to Suzhou and are scheduled to perform for three days at the Kaiming Grand Theater starting today (28th). County Magistrate Zhou learned of this and, considering that Lu Genrong dared to seduce his mistress as a servant and that his performance in Suzhou would be detrimental to good morals, he specially ordered the Public Entertainment Review Committee yesterday (27th) to prevent the issuance of a permit and ordered the Public Security Bureau to expel Lu Genrong from the country in order to maintain morality.</p>

<p>The Gaochun East Dam is located upstream on the border between Liyang and Gaochun counties. It is of great importance to the water conservancy of seven counties, including Wujin, Wuxi, Wuxian, Wujiang, Changshu, and Liyang. When the Jiangsu Construction Department was building the Jingjian Road, it was stipulated that the original line would pass through the collapsed dam head of the East Dam and go straight to Anhui. Li Yuansheng, who was entrusted by Liyang to manage the dam head, and more than one hundred shops organized a petition group and sent Fu Tingjing and other representatives to Beijing Province to petition for a change of line. The Construction Department then approved the line to be rerouted east of the dam, adding 78,000 cubic meters of earthwork and building two more bridges, costing a total of 15,000 yuan. The provincial government and the Construction Department designated that the local area should raise 5,000 yuan. The New Line Committee of the East Dam decided that the cost should be borne jointly by the relevant counties and documents were prepared to appoint Fu Tingjing, Shi Dezhong, and others to contact Suzhou, Changzhou, Wuxi, and other counties to negotiate for the allocation of funds to assist. Wuxi has transferred the letter from the Chamber of Commerce to the county government for submission to the county administration meeting to consider the allocation of funds to assist.</p>

Then they looted a small amount of clothing and left. After the incident, the injured were sent to the Wujin Hospital in the city for treatment. Zhu's ribs had been broken and she was on the verge of death. Wang Qichang was seriously injured. According to the locals, the gangsters may have been motivated by revenge, hence the viciousness of their actions.</p>

<p>Ling Chaobai, the village chief of Shangdang Township in Licun, was ordered in the 19th year of the Republic of China to solicit 78 yuan in treasury bonds, which had been outstanding for a long time. Previously, due to a feud with someone, Tang Deji reported that Ling was suspected of embezzling treasury bonds. He then raised Zhu Changren, Ling Bingren, Ling Guang'er, and Wei Zhengshi as witnesses and sued him in court for fraud. The prosecutor's office had concluded the investigation and considered that Ling Chaobai was suspected of committing a crime, so he was taken into custody and publicly prosecuted. Yesterday, Liao the judge presided over the public trial at the Criminal Division. Ling and the witnesses were summoned to the court to be examined one by one. Lawyer Fang, who was appointed by Ling, appeared in court and argued for a long time. The judge adjourned the case and set the date for the verdict on May 2.

<p>City News: Ninety-Four-Year-Old Man and Zhang Taiyan Telegraph, Warning the People Not to Be Content with Small Victories</p>
<h3 id="e115">If the Key to the Northern Gate is Not Hot River, It Will Not Be Solid; If the Situation in Hebei is Not Western Liaoning, It Will Not Be Complete <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Ma Xiangbo, a ninety-four-year-old man, and Mr. Zhang Taiyan sent a telegram yesterday, warning the people of the country. The original text is as follows: "To the people of the country: The counties of Xifeng, Jianchangying, and Luandong have been recovered temporarily, leaving only the ancient mouth of Gubei, which should be cleared soon. This is indeed due to the efforts of the soldiers, and also because the enemy has internal troubles. However, is the way to plan for the country like this? If Rehe has not been restored and the Yu Pass has not been recovered, then Beiping is like a bump on the head, something placed in a bottle. The enemy's horses are herding, and they come and go from time to time, so there is no time to rest. The one who makes gold is also the one who cannot abandon the north, just as the one who makes Chang'an cannot abandon the southeast. From the perspective of our people, all places where the Han people live are not to be abandoned. Fortunately, I told the officials of the authorities not to rejoice in small victories and forget the great worries, not to be content with near-term worries and ignore long-term concerns. If the key to the northern gate is not Hot River, it will not be solid; if the situation in Hebei is not Western Liaoning, it will not be complete. The name of joint management is difficult to endure, and the strategy of defending the border lacks good plans. If you want to rely solely on the Great Wall, you don't have the strength of Qin Huang, and if you want to steal peace, you don't have the talent of Qin Hui. Then, other than selecting generals, sharpening soldiers, and plotting further development, what is the benefit of cutting off the name of resistance to the point of being utterly hopeless? Fortunately, the morale of the soldiers is still strong, and the remaining courage has not waned. The two roads out of the army are just about to meet. Although the three eastern provinces are difficult to restore by force, these two places must be fought to the death. If this cannot be done, the shame of losing land cannot be removed, and the crime of the authorities misleading the country cannot be redeemed. The Emperor's Axe is in front, and I hope to be warned and introspected."</p>
<p>Three Important Telegrams from the University Association</p>
<h3 id="e116">Requesting the Central Government to Announce Severance of Diplomatic Relations with Japan, Telegram to Chairman Chiang to Go North to Resist Japan, Telegram of Condolences to the Generals and Soldiers Who Resisted Japan and Suppressed Communism <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>In view of the tense situation, the Shanghai University Students Union yesterday sent three important telegrams, requesting the central government to announce the severance of diplomatic relations with Japan and issue a national mobilization order, and requesting Chairman Chiang to go north to resist Japan, as well as a circular telegram of condolences to the generals and soldiers who resisted Japan and suppressed communism at the front. The original telegrams are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e117">Severing Diplomatic Relations with Japan <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>To the esteemed National Government of the Central Party Headquarters in Nanjing: The Northeast has fallen, Rehe has followed, like a ravenous boar and a long serpent, directly encroaching upon our heartland. The national crisis has reached such a point that only with the spirit of acting swiftly and decisively, and the resolve of burning our boats, can our central government resolutely announce the severing of diplomatic relations with Japan and engage in a do-or-die battle with the tyrannical Japanese. A national mobilization order should be immediately promulgated, concentrating all national manpower and resources under wartime control to meet the exigencies and avert this great disaster. At this time of deep invasion and urgent affairs, compromise cannot achieve completeness, and sacrifice is unavoidable. If we can fight for the survival of the nation, even shedding blood and brains is not to be regretted. We, the students of Shanghai University, pledge our full support as the government's backing. An urgent telegram awaits orders. The United Association of Students of Shanghai Universities, respectfully and gratefully.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Heading North to Resist Japan <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>To the esteemed Chairman Chiang of Nanchang: Ever since the tyrannical Japanese launched a large-scale re-invasion, the natural barrier of the Great Wall has fallen successively, and the frontier has been lost, endangering Peiping and Tianjin. Although the troops on the front lines have all fought valiantly, they cannot sustain the critical situation due to the lack of unified command. Your Excellency defends the Party and the country, and commands the troops. Previously, when the tyrannical Japanese entered the customs and North China was on the verge of collapse, Your Excellency's heading north greatly boosted morale and curbed the enemy's arrogance. Today's crisis is even worse than before. With the suppression of bandits in Jiangxi making steady progress, we earnestly request Your Excellency to go north again to command and complete the entire effort to resist Japan. This urgent telegram is respectfully submitted, and we humbly beg for your consideration. The United Association of Students of Shanghai Universities, respectfully.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Saluting the Soldiers <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>To all the soldiers on the front lines resisting Japan and suppressing the communists, forwarded by all newspapers nationwide: The tyranny of the Japanese and the rampant actions of the communist bandits have brought the nation to the brink of peril. Fortunately, the soldiers on the front lines are determined to sacrifice, fight valiantly, blunt the enemy's sharp edge, and rescue our people from fire and water. Warding off external aggression and pacifying internal unrest is admired by all within the seas. We hereby offer our regards and hope you will continue your efforts. The students of Shanghai University pledge to be your support. The United Association of Students of Shanghai Universities, respectfully.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Attempts to Seize Factory Inspection Rights</p>
<h3 id="e120">The Municipal Government Sent a Letter Yesterday to the Consulates-General Requesting Rectification, and Three National Products Organizations Objected <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession passed the amendment to Article 34 of the bylaws of the Yangjingbang Regulations at the recent Special Meeting of Western Taxpayers, attempting to seize the management rights of factories within the concession. Mayor Wu and the Chinese Ratepayers Association, among others, have made earnest statements. The Municipal Council's move violates the Land Regulations. At 10:00 AM yesterday, the Municipal Government formally sent a letter to the Consuls-General of various countries stationed in Shanghai, requesting correction. The original letter is excerpted below:</p>
<p>To whom it may concern: Factory inspection is an integral part of our national labor administration. Since the promulgation of the Factory Law by the National Government, this government has repeatedly sent personnel to negotiate with the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession regarding the inspection of factories within the jurisdiction, but no agreement has been reached. Now, the Municipal Council, knowing that it has no right to manage the factories within the concession according to the Yangjingbang Regulations, has adopted the method of amending Article 34 of the bylaws to attempt to obtain the right to inspect factories. This government is deeply surprised. The concession is Chinese territory, and the people within the concession have the same obligation to obey the laws of their country as the people residing outside the concession. It is not permissible for the concession authorities to exclude the people within the concession from the jurisdiction of their own country by means of a resolution. The legal status of the concession is very clear, and the powers of the Municipal Council are also limited. Now, attempting to obtain a legal basis for managing factories by adding bylaws is absurd. Factory inspection is established to implement labor policies, and its purpose is to promote the sound development of the national economy, which is different from local governance. Even based on the Yangjingbang Regulations, Article 9, which states "Planning governance for proper management," lists specific matters of governance rather than providing a general scope. Even if there are bylaws, they cannot exceed the scope of the items listed in the regulations; otherwise, they would conflict with Article 11 of the regulations. Such abuse of power not only infringes upon national sovereignty but also violates the treaties signed between China and various countries. This government, in consideration of respecting national legal rights and protecting the interests of labor, lodges a protest against this ultra vires and illegal act of the Municipal Council. In addition to sending separate letters, a corresponding letter is sent, hoping for your careful consideration, prompt correction, and a reply. To the Consuls-General of various countries stationed in Shanghai.</p>

<p>Regarding the case of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession attempting to seize factory inspection rights, according to a person in charge of the Ministry of Industry, the ministry and the Central People's Movement Committee have sent personnel to Shanghai to discuss response measures with the Shanghai Municipal Government. A protest has been lodged with the Shanghai Consular Body. If there are no satisfactory results, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will lodge representations with the ministers of the related countries stationed in China. Furthermore, our country's representatives will raise this case at the upcoming International Labour Conference, seeking international judgment.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Citizens' Association for Promoting National Products and the China National Products Maintenance Association held a joint meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday in the grand hall of the association in Jiu Mu Di to oppose the Municipal Council's seizure of our country's factory inspection. Representatives from factories such as Yapu Er Electric Factory, Tian Yi Wei Mother Factory, Yili Soda Factory, and Huayang Dyeing and Weaving Factory, including Xu Tingzuo, Hu Xiyuan, Zhang Zilian, and Wang Xingyi, totaling over fifty people, attended. Chen Yiting presided over the meeting, reporting on the purpose of the meeting and the process of the Special Meeting of Western Taxpayers amending the Land Regulations to authorize the Municipal Council to manage factories. Then, discussions began. Sun Daosheng, Zhu Dechao, Chen Binghui, Wang Xingyi, and others successively expressed their opinions and resolved: (1) Send a letter to the Municipal Government requesting serious representations to strive for national rights, with the association leading all national products factories in Shanghai as a pledge of support. (2) Send letters to various national products organizations to form a committee to oppose the Municipal Council's inspection of factories, and publicly elect Chen Binghui, Chen Yiting, Wang Xingyi, Sun Daosheng, Xu Genghua, Wang Jiean, and Wu Zhihao as representatives, designating Wang Xingyi and Chen Yiting as conveners. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Declaration of the National Products Factory Association <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai National Products Factory Association issued a declaration yesterday, stating: The amendment to Article 34 of the bylaws of the Land Regulations passed by the Shanghai Public Concession Western Ratepayers' Meeting on the 19th of this month, regarding the management of factories within the concession, not only attempts to seize factory inspection rights but is also essentially a destruction of our country's sovereignty, a severance of our country's laws, and a conflict with international conventions. The Factory Law and the Factory Inspection Law are complete national laws and cannot be compared to local government's single regulations. Although the Municipal Council is a de facto autonomous body, it absolutely has no right to our country's national laws. Knowing that it has no right to handle factory management, it uses the clever method of amending the bylaws at the Western Ratepayers' Meeting, which can be described as doing everything possible to deceive the heavens and change the earth. The original text of Article 34 of the bylaws of the Land Regulations stipulates that small vegetable markets, clubs, billiard rooms, restaurants, etc., opened within the concession must obtain licenses from it; otherwise, they will be subject to fines. This has nothing to do with factory management. How can it be far-fetched and combined into one matter to gain unlimited real power that has never existed before? Moreover, Chinese residents in the Public Concession account for more than 95%, while Westerners account for less than 5%. Chinese residents pay 55% of the taxes, while Westerners pay 45%. As fellow citizens, even if the Western Ratepayers' Meeting strongly argues and insists on amending, the Chinese Ratepayers' Association's general meeting has already resolved to oppose it, and in terms of legal principles, the majority should be followed. This association, as a group of national products factories, absolutely opposes this kind of illegal and unreasonable behavior that attempts to seize factory inspection rights. This declaration is hereby issued.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Korean Inventors Invent Electric Anti-Aircraft Gun; Ministry of Military Affairs Orders Approval for Manufacturing <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>According to China East News Agency, since the tyrannical Japanese planes have wreaked havoc, people in the country have gradually paid attention to air defense. In recent days, some people have invented flying arrows and flying thunder, but their firing power is not as good as that of anti-aircraft guns, and the results are not significant. Recently, two Koreans who have become naturalized Chinese citizens have invented an electric anti-aircraft gun that can fire up to twenty English miles, reaching 10,000 meters. The highest flying aircraft only flies to 5,000 meters, so if this new weapon is successfully tested, it can hit aircraft with ease. A reporter from the China East News Agency went to various places to inquire and will record the details below.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Overview of Purchase and Manufacturing <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>The inventors of this weapon are also Korean. Its structure is similar to that of an anti-aircraft gun, but it adds two devices, namely a small mirror and two electric boxes. When firing bullets, it relies entirely on electricity, and when aiming at aircraft, a small mirror is also required (Ordinary anti-aircraft guns have one small mirror, while this type of electric anti-aircraft gun has two small mirrors, making it more convenient to aim at aircraft).</p>
<h3 id="e126">Enemy Plots to Buy It <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>When the two Koreans invented the gun, the Japanese government became aware of it and paid great attention. It then sent people to buy it, willing to negotiate with the Koreans to purchase it for one million yuan. The two Koreans were hesitating when He Shiping, who had served as a staff officer of the Jiangbei guerrilla commander, found out. He tried his best to win them over and urged them to serve the country. At that time, he drafted a memorial and reported it to the National Government, requesting a trial manufacturing. The National Government then ordered it to be directly submitted to the Ministry of Military Affairs for approval. On the first of this month, when Wang Jingwei arrived in Shanghai, He personally visited him at Chu Minyi's residence. Wang quite agreed with this electric anti-aircraft gun.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Military Department Approves <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>According to He himself, he had reported the construction situation of the Korean gun to the Ministry of Military Affairs, and now he has received the department's Bing She Zi No. 317 approval. The original text reads: "Received, please draw detailed diagrams and submit them directly to this department for review." This is the approval.</p>
<h3 id="e128">The Gun's Effectiveness <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>He said that the gun's effectiveness is extremely great. All aircraft in the air, regardless of how high they fly, can be destroyed. Furthermore, if the gun's internal parts are installed in torpedo boats, submarines can be attacked. If installed in ordinary artillery, it can shoot at very distant enemies. He has now submitted a request to the Ministry of Military Affairs for the allocation of funds for manufacturing. If approved, a trial manufacturing can be carried out.</p>

<h3 id="e132">Broadway Road Merchants and Citizens Schedule Regular Inspections of Japanese Goods <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>The 7th district branch of the Broadway Road Citizens' Association, in view of the severe suffering of merchants and citizens in the area after the January 28th Incident, and now that time has passed, there are unscrupulous merchants who are profit-driven and sell enemy goods, specially formed an inspection team, which will set out on a regular basis to inspect the various businesses under its jurisdiction, and seal up enemy goods, to fulfill the duties of a citizen. The notification is recorded below: To whom it may concern: According to the letter from the Citizens' General Association, it was resolved by the plenary meeting of the 4th National Products Movement Committee of the Association that since the January 28th Shanghai War, the citizens of the city have been innocently and severely traumatized, which is an unprecedented history of pain. At this time when Rehe has fallen and Tianjin is in danger, recently some lawless merchants have been blinded by profit and have been found selling Japanese goods, which is outrageous and extremely indignant. The district branches should be ordered to organize inspection teams to regularly inspect all members, and if enemy goods are found, they should be sealed up to fulfill the duties of a citizen. This has been passed by the General Assembly and should be notified accordingly, hoping that you will check accordingly. The Association has now organized an inspection team and will inspect all members in the near future. Your store is one of the members of the Association and also one of the citizens of China. This letter is hereby sent to you. When the Association sends personnel to inspect, I hope that you will not misunderstand.</p>

<p>The Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association telegraphed Song Zheyuan, Shang Zhen, Xu Tingyao, He Zhuguo, Wang Yizhe, Pang Bingxun, Xiao Zhichu, Sun Kuiyuan, and other army commanders and division commanders, saying: (Official titles omitted) In admiration, and forwarded to all the officers and soldiers of the armies: Japanese pirates have been invading for nearly two years, having occupied the three provinces, and then seized Yuiguan, and then raided Rehe and peeped into North China, devouring them like silkworms and whales, without limit. Its ultimate intention is to destroy our country and exterminate our nation. All the generals lead brave soldiers, kill enemies for the country, fight bloody battles, fight for the survival of the country, and sacrifice heroically to maintain the lifeblood of the nation. Your great achievements shock China and foreign countries, and all the people of the country admire you. Recently, the Japanese pirates were forced by the environment to retreat across the board, which is a good opportunity for our army to advance and pursue and restore the territory. At this time when the green gauze tent rises, the Volunteer Army outside the Guan will definitely be waiting with spears in hand. I urgently hope that the generals will lead the troops out of the country on a specified date to achieve the effect of internal and external attacks. Time cannot be lost. We look forward to the good news. The Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association, respectfully.</p>

<p>According to Guo Wen News Agency, Cen Chunxuan, former Governor-General of Liangguang and one of the seven presidents of the Constitutional Protection Government, has been residing in Shanghai for twelve years since abandoning political life in 1920. Cen had a history of heart disease, and ten days ago, he suddenly suffered a stroke. Despite the efforts of famous Chinese and Western doctors, he passed away at 7:20 AM yesterday (the 27th) at his residence at No. 104 Siming Village, Foch Road, Shanghai, at the age of 73.

<p>Cen held prominent positions in the late Qing Dynasty and the early Republic of China, and was famous throughout the country. He was the son of Cen Xiangqin, the former Governor-General of Yunnan and Guizhou. There were five brothers, and Cen Chunxuan was the third. Only Cen Chunming is still alive, and the rest have passed away early. Cen Chunming was the former Governor of Hunan in the Qing Dynasty and is now also in Shanghai. Cen's first wife passed away long ago, and he now has four concubines, all of whom are concubines. He is survived by five sons and four daughters. The eldest son is Deguang, the second is Delin, the third is Detian, the fourth is Dezhao, and the fifth is Dehong. All but Dehong are adults.

<h3 id="e140">Brief Biography of Cen <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Cen, named Chunxuan and styled Yunjie, was a native of Xilin County, Guangxi. During the late Qing Dynasty, he served as a provincial commander and was successively promoted to Governor of Guangdong, Governor-General of Liangguang, Governor-General of Yunnan and Guizhou, and Governor-General of Sichuan. He was then transferred to the Minister of Posts and Communications, rising rapidly and becoming famous for a time. Finally, the Qing court sent Cen to mediate the Sichuan-Hankou Railway dispute. Before long, the Xinhai Revolution broke out. With the founding of the Republic of China, Cen's thinking was relatively new. He once served as the Director-General of the Hubei-Guangdong Railway. Later, Yuan Shikai plotted to usurp the throne and changed the title to Hongxian. Cen strongly opposed it, so Yuan ordered his arrest. Cen then fled to Nanyang. After Yuan's death, Cen returned to China. In 1917, when Duan Qirui formed a cabinet, Cen went to the southwest the following year and formed an extraordinary parliament and constitutional protection government in Guangdong. At that time, Cen was one of the seven presidents, including Premier Sun, Tang Shaoyi, Wu Tingfang, and Lu Rongting. In 1920, the Guangdong and Guangxi factions fought for power, and Cen was the leader of the Guangxi faction. Later, the Guangdong faction gained power, and Guangxi province also came under the control of the Guangdong faction. Cen fled to Shanghai as a resident. At that time, Cen was old, so he decided to retire to Shanghai and spend the rest of his years reading poetry and books, no longer seeking a living in politics. After twelve years, in 1922, the Northern Government still awarded Cen the First Class Grand Ribbon Baoguang Jiahe Medal.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Sent a Letter to the Telephone Bureau Requesting Exemption from Additional Telephone Charges</p>
<h3 id="e148">From Six Dollars to Ten Dollars: The Public's Financial Burden is Truly Insurmountable <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Shanghai Telephone Bureau yesterday, requesting the exemption of telephone fee increases. The original text stated: According to a letter from the Shanghai Restaurant Trade Association, members of the Zhabei Greater China and other establishments reported that the North and South City Chinese telephone bureaus, disregarding commercial conditions, have replaced their equipment and taken the opportunity to increase prices, which were announced to take effect on May 1st. Since the January 28th Incident, the disaster areas have not yet recovered, and the original telephone fee was six dollars per household, which has now been increased to ten dollars. At a time when business is sluggish, this sudden doubling of telephone fees is a burden that merchants and residents cannot bear. They requested that the matter be negotiated with the bureau to cancel the price increase and continue charging the original price, in order to alleviate the merchants' difficulties and prevent their downfall. This matter was referred to the Executive Committee for discussion on the 23rd of this month, and it was resolved to first send a letter to your esteemed organization for review, to argue strongly for the cancellation of the price increase with the telephone bureau, and to continue charging the original price, in order to alleviate the merchants' plight and save them from impending disaster. This is of great importance. In view of this, it is evident that the city's commercial stagnation since the January 28th Incident last year is obvious to all, especially in the Chinese areas of the North and South Cities. Telephones are a necessity for business, and now the cost per household has increased to ten dollars, which is several times more than the previous six dollars per household. At a time when the productivity of citizens is declining, it is truly difficult to bear. Accordingly, this matter is reported and conveyed, and it is hoped that your esteemed bureau will take this into consideration and exempt the aforementioned fee increase, in order to strengthen public relations.</p>
<p>Following the Telephone Bureau's Installation of Automatic Switching Equipment</p>
<h3 id="e149">A History of Telephones <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications was established in the twenty-eighth year of the Guangxu reign of the late Qing Dynasty. At the time of its establishment, it only rented three floors in a civilian house on Xinmatou Li Street as its office. It housed 480 manual switchboard lines, and there were only over 200 subscribers at the time. Later, the number gradually increased to over 400. In the ninth year of the Republic, the bureau purchased land on Zhonghua Road, Dananmen, and built its own office, switching room, storage room, and staff dormitory. It also ordered 2,000 common battery switchboard lines from the United States, installed underground cables, and reconstructed overhead lines, thus achieving a rudimentary scale. Subsequently, the Zhabei, Jiangwan, Longhua, Nanxiang, and Wusong branch offices were successively established. In the fourteenth year of the Republic, a contract was signed with the China and Foreign Telephone Company to allow telephone communication between the Chinese and foreign concession areas, which was convenient for the citizens. In the fifteenth year, the Shanghai-Xichang long-distance line was completed, marking the beginning of telephone communication between Beijing and Shanghai. In the eighteenth year, the Ministry of Communications signed a contract with the China Automatic Telephone Company, and added new Zhabei and Pudong bureau sites on Yongxing Road and Dongchang Road in Zhabei and Pudong respectively. The Nanshi, Zhabei, and Pudong bureaus were converted to Strowger automatic telephones, with 3,000 lines in Nanshi, 1,500 lines in Zhabei, and 300 lines in Pudong, totaling 4,800 lines. The total price of all automatic equipment and line materials was US$570,000.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Recent Developments <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>After the Ministry of Communications signed a contract with the China Automatic Telephone Company to purchase automatic equipment, it signed another contract with the company in May of the nineteenth year to build the Zhabei and Pudong bureau buildings. In April of that year, the company began shipping automatic equipment materials to Shanghai in batches. In September, installation began at the Nanshi Main Bureau. In the twentieth year, the Zhabei and Pudong bureau buildings were completed. By December of that year, the automatic equipment in Nanshi and Zhabei had been installed. However, the Ministry of Communications realized that automatic telephones required not only excellent internal equipment but also perfect external lines. Therefore, it specifically ordered the Shanghai Telephone Bureau to construct 1,660 meters of underground conduits in the Nanshi district and 3,520 meters of underground conduits in the Zhabei district, and to add overhead cables to shorten open-wire lines in order to reduce interference. This project was very time-consuming. Unexpectedly, just as the various projects were nearing completion, the January 28th Incident suddenly broke out. The automatic equipment and line projects of the Zhabei branch were destroyed, and the underground cables and pole materials stored in the material warehouse were reduced to ashes. The project was greatly hampered. As a result, materials from Nanshi and Pudong were transported to supplement and repair the project, which was barely completed in early April. These are the developments of the past three years.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Ordering Telephones <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Since the automatic equipment in Nanshi and Zhabei had been completed and the external lines had also been completed, the Ministry of Communications repeatedly ordered the bureau to expedite the work and prepare for telephone service in the Nanshi and Zhabei districts as soon as possible for the convenience of the Shanghai citizens. Therefore, the bureau rushed to work internally and externally for several days and finally opened telephone service on April 15th. However, although the internal automatic equipment of the Pudong branch had also been installed, most of the external line materials had been moved to Nanshi and Zhabei and could not be replenished. Therefore, telephone service could not be opened at the same time. The Ministry of Communications is now trying to order materials. As soon as they arrive, the bureau will be ordered to start work and it will soon be completed.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Increasing Trunk Lines <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai is a major trading port, and the concession is the center. Among the bureau's subscribers, seven or eight out of ten communicate with telephones in the concession. Therefore, communication between the Chinese and foreign concession areas is the biggest problem. The bureau and the Shanghai Telephone Company originally had 24 pairs of incoming and outgoing trunk lines and 6 pairs of long-distance trunk lines, all included. After the automatic telephone service was implemented, the number of incoming and outgoing trunk lines was increased to 30 pairs each. The incoming trunk lines from all directions were directly connected to the automatic equipment, eliminating the trouble of switching through the switchboard, so that both parties improved. The long-distance station of the Nanshi Main Bureau was moved to the new Zhabei Bureau, and another 8 pairs of trunk lines were set up. Therefore, the communication of the public has become more agile than before. The bureau has asked the Shanghai Telephone Company to continue to increase the equipment for the trunk lines and to cancel the three-minute limit and the five-cent fee for the ocean. The company did not agree because of the greater losses and insufficient equipment. If it can be successful in the future, then the public will be even more convenient to communicate.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Renting Trunk Lines <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>There were originally 19 pairs of trunk lines between Nanshi and Zhabei. Recently, due to the development of business, the number of trunk lines was insufficient. It was originally planned to rent 100 pairs, but the rental price has increased several times compared to before. Only 30 pairs were rented. This is because the lines are completely rented from the Shanghai Telephone Company. The original rent was 50 taels per pair per year. Now the company must pay an annual rent of 200 taels per pair according to the newly established price, which is four times the original price. The Ministry of Communications repeatedly ordered the bureau to negotiate with the Shanghai Telephone Company to reduce the price, but it did not succeed. However, for the convenience of the citizens, the bureau was ordered to rent 30 pairs at the price first, so that communication between the two places would not be delayed due to congestion.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Reasons for the Price Increase <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>The bureau ordered automatic equipment, and the capital expenditure was enormous. Moreover, the price of gold has risen sharply, doubling from what it used to be. The annual rent for the trunk lines has also increased from 50 taels to 200 taels. In addition, long-distance and Chinese-foreign concession communication still require the connection of operators. Therefore, the various maintenance costs continue to increase, and there is a real danger of being unable to make ends meet. Moreover, after the automatic telephone service started, according to the contract, a bonus of 4,000 yuan, equivalent to about 20,000 Chinese currency, must be paid to the China Automatic Telephone Company every month. The expenditure has increased sharply, so the telephone price has been appropriately increased to provide some support. However, due to the commercial depression in Shanghai after the January 28th Incident, the Ministry of Communications, in order to show consideration for the citizens, specially reduced the monthly rent for automatic telephones in the bureau by one yuan compared to the capital. The Longhua, Jiangwan, Zhenru, and Wusong areas where automatic telephones have not been installed will continue to be handled according to the old rules, in order to relieve the burden on the citizens.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Ongoing Work <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Telephone Bureau is a national enterprise and should abide by the Ministry's regulations, strive to implement them, and refer to commercial practices to become fully commercialized. Therefore, the planning of projects, the review of materials, the assessment of employees, the development of business, the economy of facilities, and the convenience of the public must be carefully studied and improved. Now the bureau's Nanshi and Zhabei automatic equipment conversion projects have been completed, and the Pudong branch will also begin work. The equipment and lines have been gradually improved, and the capital costs have also increased accordingly. It is reported that the bureau is improving the city's telephone services. If direct Chinese-foreign communication is possible, then the public will feel much more convenient at that time.</p>

<p>The China National Aviation Corporation believes that the Longhua Airport is too small and difficult for takeoffs and landings, and plans to acquire civilian land to expand the airport. This has been approved by the Ministry of Communications and personnel have been sent to Shanghai to conduct a joint survey. It has now been determined that over 19 acres of land will be acquired and the price will be paid according to the civilian land acquisition method. The contract has been drafted and will be signed on the first of next month, and construction will begin immediately.</p>

<h3 id="e159">The Ministry of Industry Issues a Circular to Strictly Enforce National Factory Inspections <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Social Bureau received a directive from the Ministry of Industry yesterday to strictly enforce factory inspections to prevent accidents. The original text stated: (For compliance, it is found that the implementation of factory inspections is an important part of labor administration. Since the Ministry was ordered by the National Government to promulgate the Factory Inspection Law, it has repeatedly consulted the provincial and municipal governments to instruct the competent authorities to earnestly organize the inspections, and the Ministry has formulated the Regulations on the Appointment, Rewards and Punishments of Factory Inspectors and the Statistical Table of Factory Inspection Rewards, which have been promulgated in the past. However, most of the competent authorities in various places have failed to earnestly implement the factory inspection matters according to law, except for a few provinces and cities, so that the equipment of various factories and mines has not been perfect, and there have been occasional accidents, endangering the lives of workers. For example, the recent explosion of the drying cylinder in the Zhengtai Rubber Factory in Shanghai has caused many deaths and injuries of male and female workers. If the local competent authorities can strictly enforce factory inspections at ordinary times and strictly supervise the various factories, they will not cause this accident. Therefore, the factory inspection is really not allowed to be delayed any longer. In the future, the competent authorities should take the tragic accident in the Zhengtai Factory in Shanghai as a warning, urge factory inspections, and earnestly organize them at any time in accordance with the provisions of the Factory Inspection Law, and prepare a detailed plan for the implementation of factory inspections and submit it to the Ministry for verification. In addition to issuing separate orders, the Hall and Bureau are hereby ordered to comply with and implement and report this order.)</p>

<p>Workers Oppose Suspension of Work and Salary Reduction</p>
<h3 id="e165">Workers from Yongyu, Tianyi, Siyi Factories Petition Party and Government Agencies Yesterday Morning <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Our country's silk yarn factories have been affected by the economic panic and business is sluggish, resulting in suspension of work and salary reduction. On the other hand, the workers are concerned about their livelihoods. Once they lose their jobs, they lack the means to make a living, and labor-management disputes are increasing day by day. Yesterday, workers from Yongyu, Tianyi, Siyi factories petitioned party and government agencies. They are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e166">Yongyu Yarn Factory <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>The Yongyu Heji Yarn Factory on Guangfu Road, Zhabei, has a total of more than 3,800 weavers. Recently, the factory claimed that it was operating at a loss and that its economic turnover was not flexible, so it closed the factory on the 6th of this month. All the workers, with their livelihoods in trouble, petitioned the municipal government and the municipal party headquarters. However, after two weeks, there was no movement. Yesterday morning at 10 o'clock, five representatives, Yin Zhen, Jing Yunlong, You Jinxiang, Fang Xiangming, and Cui Jinhou, went to the municipal party headquarters to petition, requesting early mediation. Lu Yinchu of the Civil Training Department received them and promised to handle it together with the Social Bureau. Then they went to the Social Bureau to petition, and Zhang Chuqiang, a mediator, received them and promised to handle it immediately after asking for instructions.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Tianyi Silk Factory <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>The Tianyi Silk Factory on Zhengsheng Road, Tilanqiao, Hudong, has a total of more than 200 male and female workers. Recently, they opposed the factory's reduction of original wages, changing to an 80% calculation, and the cancellation of the subsidy of 50 cents per person per day for warp and weft and the old practice of a monthly bonus of one yuan per person, which aroused the opposition of all the workers. They petitioned the Social Bureau on the 23rd, but no mediation has been made. The factory has declared that if any workers object, they will be dismissed. The workers were panic-stricken and held a petition flag and petitioned the Social Bureau yesterday morning at 10:40, demanding protection and immediate mediation. Wang Xianqing, director of the Mediation Section, received them and appointed mediator Tan Peiyan to go to investigate at 1:00 p.m. and scheduled a hearing for both parties at 9:00 a.m. this morning.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Siyi Silk Factory <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>The Siyi Factory on Zhoujiazui Road suspended work on March 13 due to sluggish business. The Social Bureau mediated and agreed on a method allowing the capital side to suspend work for 40 days, until the end of April. In May, work will resume as usual. Now the capital side has notified the workers that, due to inflexible capital turnover and the impact of the current situation on silk merchants, they cannot resume work. For the sake of the workers' lives, they have applied to the Social Bureau for legal dismissal. This aroused the opposition of the workers, who sent representatives Yu Fuli, Chen Biheng, Zhu Ali, and Gong Zhangsen to the Social Bureau to petition for relief yesterday morning. Mediator Tan Peiyan received them and said that since the capital side could not continue to operate, it would be difficult to force them. Both parties will be summoned on a scheduled basis to carry out dismissal procedures.</p>
<h3 id="e169">The Story of the Mercy and Child Welfare Association's Relief of Dai Caixin <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>On February 3rd of this year, a woman named Dai Caixin complained to the China Mercy and Child Welfare Association. She claimed that she was 20 years old, from Ningbo, and lost her mother at the age of three. She was raised by her grandmother. At the age of 18, she came to Shanghai with her father and stepmother, Dai Yao. Because her father, Dai Mingguan, did not work properly, spent day and night with villains, and indulged in smoking, drinking, and gambling, the family became destitute. Listening to the instigation of her stepmother, she followed the evil plan of the gangsters and decided to sell her to Hankou as a prostitute. She had negotiated prices twice in the Guifangge teahouse in Hongkou and had drafted a sales contract for 600 yuan. Knowing that disaster was imminent, the woman had no choice but to resist her father and elope to Ningbo. She wept to her relatives and friends, but none of them dared to agree because they were afraid of Dai's evil. The woman had no choice but to take the opportunity to hang herself and escape, reporting to the association to request relief. The association immediately assigned the protection officer Wang Guanyi to investigate the matter and learned the truth. On the one hand, he reported and registered to the Hua Jun, the district chief of the Huishan Police Station where her father lived, and because the woman's age was not in line with the regulations of the association's attached educational institute, it was difficult to accommodate her. He then inquired whether Caixin had any relatives and friends in Shanghai. It was said that although there were several relatives and friends in Shanghai, they were all afraid of Dai's wickedness and dared not hear about it. Only her uncle Jiang Zhuoying, who had moved from Suzhou to Shanghai due to (reason), and whose address had not yet been known to Dai, might be willing to accommodate her temporarily. Therefore, officer Wang set out to verify that Jiang was a former employee of the Sanyou Industrial Company and now runs the Dahua Cotton Weaving Factory in Shanghai, with a wife and daughter, and is extremely kind. He asked if Jiang would agree to temporarily entrust Xin Cai to him. Jiang and his wife were initially suspicious and afraid, and dared not rashly agree. Later, it was explained that this was a temporary entrustment and could be resolved immediately, and the association could keep the address temporarily confidential to avoid trouble. Therefore, Jiang and his wife reluctantly agreed. The association immediately completed the entrustment of Caixin, and immediately informed her grandmother in Ningbo and summoned her father to the association to start mediation, in order to reconcile the father and daughter and ensure that she would not be sold. Her father went to the association several times, but in the end, with a cunning and stubborn attitude, he refused to mediate and insisted on getting interest from his daughter. The association was about to send him to the police station for legal action, but he fled to Ningbo and threatened his relatives and friends, demanding that they hand over the woman. Otherwise, he would destroy the furniture and take the clothes to pawn. This matter was most serious in his brother Dai Manguan's place. Xia Guan had no choice but to travel back and forth between Shanghai and Ningbo, visiting various relatives and friends, and inadvertently met Jiang Zhuoying. He told the truth, and in order to avoid hurting the feelings of his brothers, Xia Guan told Mingguan Jiang's address. Mingguan privately took Jiang and his wife to the (district) office without the knowledge of the association, accusing them of abducting Caixin, and made false statements and reversed the facts. After the association was notified by the office, it sent officer Wang to rush to prove everything. The Public Security Bureau sent a document to the Shanghai Local Court, and after the investigation, Jiang and his wife were released, and Dai Mingguan was dealt with according to law. With the consent of the Mercy and Child Welfare Association, Caixin was transferred to the China Women and Children Relief Association. The association believes that this case has caused a lot of trouble to Jiang and his wife. In addition to asking them to write to various newspapers to correct the matter, the facts are recorded above.</p>
<h3 id="e170">The Examination of the Case of the Chinese Police Shooting and Killing the Head Constable and Then Killing Himself <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>丨The Two Corpses Were Each Claimed by Their Wives丨</p>
<p>Li Chunhe, No. 1889, a Chinese constable from Shandong Province in the Desserve Way Police Station, 32 years old, had hatred with Song Huchen, No. 322, a Chinese constable from the same row, 37 years old. At about 12:00 a.m. the day before, Song led Li and more than a dozen people to dispatch from the police station. Unexpectedly, when they were walking to the intersection of Sichuan Road near Desserve Way, Li left the team and fired a shot at Song, hitting a vital point, and then fired four shots on the ground. Finally, he fired a shot at his chest. As a result, the two constables fell to the ground unconscious and bleeding profusely. The police station sent the two constables to the police hospital for treatment, but because they were seriously injured, the rescue was ineffective and they died soon. The corpses were sent to the Ferlen Road mortuary for examination. It has been recorded in this newspaper yesterday. At about 10:00 a.m. yesterday, Guo Wei, a prosecutor appointed by the First Special District Local Court, arrived at the mortuary to examine the corpses. According to the report of Hua Bu No. 900, at that time, I was in front of Li Bu. When walking to the intersection of North Sichuan Road, I suddenly heard Li shouting loudly, "Third Dao Tou, walk slowly!" Then I saw him leave the team and walk south. After shooting Song, he shot himself in the chest. In addition, according to Song Zeng, Song's wife, who lives at No. 312 Haifang Road, there are old mothers and young children at home, and the former husband (told) me that the quarrel with Li Bu was because my husband went out on a business trip on the evening of the 24th of this month and saw that Li Bu had left his post without permission and was gambling in a nearby car line. Therefore, my husband returned to the police station and wrote it in the book. Later, the capture was learned, resulting in mutual quarrel, unexpectedly, this unfortunate thing happened and so on. In addition, Song's concubine Wang and Li's wife Ren told one. Guo Jun Yu examined that the deceased, Hua Third Dao Tou No. 322 Song Huchen, was indeed shot and killed by Hua Bu No. 1889 Li Chunhe before his death. Li Chunhe was indeed self-shot in the chest before his death. Song Huchen's corpse was handed over to his wife Song Zeng, and Li Chunhe's corpse was handed over to his wife Li Ren, respectively, to be taken back for burial. It is heard that the Western head of the police station said that the police station has allocated 120 yuan to the families of the two police officers to prepare coffins, and there will be pensions, savings, etc. to be distributed in the future.</p>

<p>Le Zhenbao, the owner of Taichang Woodware Store, was kidnapped by bandits on December 9th of last year, who demanded a large ransom. Subsequently, Chief Detective You A'gen of the Old Zhabei Police Station managed to detect the bandits' den, rescued Le, and arrested many kidnappers. Six guns, including gas pistols and Mauser pistols, and more than 260 rounds of ammunition were seized. They were handed over to the First Special District Local Court for investigation and conclusion. Ma Gensheng, Guan Afu, and Ren Zixiang were sentenced to death; Cao Ziqing, Jin Zipei, and Wang Xiaosizi were sentenced to life imprisonment; Hu Hongsheng was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment; Li Youren and Zhou Jinsheng were sentenced to 13 years imprisonment each; Cao Ziyu and Pan Yaoming were sentenced to 7 years imprisonment each. The guns and ammunition were confiscated. However, the bandits sentenced to death and life imprisonment were not satisfied with the first instance verdict and filed an appeal. Among those sentenced to imprisonment, Li Youren also filed an appeal. Previously, the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court opened a hearing. When the cases of the appellants were investigated, Cao Ziqing hired lawyer Zhan Jifeng to defend him. Based on various reasons, he argued that the original sentence of life imprisonment was inappropriate and requested a revised verdict. Some of the other appellants also hired lawyers to defend them. Yesterday afternoon, the date for the verdict was announced. Police lawyer Gan Jingxian and the lawyers of the appellants appeared in court to await the announcement. Subsequently, Judge Zhao and Assessors Zhou and Jiang took their seats and announced the verdict: Cao Ziqing and Wang Xiaosizi were both reduced to 15 years imprisonment. The appeals of Jin Zipei and Li Youren were rejected, and the original sentences were upheld. Ma Gensheng, Guan Afu, and Ren Zixiang were convicted according to the Law for the Punishment of Bandits, and according to the law, they had no right to appeal, so their appeals were also rejected.</p>

<p>Wen Hong'en, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, recently received a tip that a female Communist Party member from Changsha, Zhang Xiulan, also known as Huang Li, 29 years old, was hiding at No. 9, Lane 729, Avenue des Soeurs, in the French Concession, secretly working in Shanghai. Director Wen, upon receiving the report, prepared a document and dispatched personnel to the French Concession Police on the morning of the day before yesterday to request assistance in arresting and transferring her. The Political Department sent Chinese and foreign detectives to the address to arrest Zhang and confiscate documents and books. She was taken to the police station. The next afternoon, she was escorted to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court for interrogation. At 3:30, Criminal Judge Zhou Yunhui, accompanied by Assessors Guo Dezhang and Fan Peien, together with the prosecutor, opened the Criminal Court Three for interrogation. Police lawyer Yao Zhaodi appeared in court and requested a postponement for investigation. The Public Security Bureau also sent personnel to the case, requesting the transfer. Because the court declared that the case was political, listening was prohibited. According to the results of the interrogation, the court ordered a change of date for further investigation, and the defendant was returned to custody to await further instructions.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Muslim community previously proposed to rename Fangbang Road in the Nanshi district to Andexin Road in memory of Battalion Commander Andexin, a martyr of the Battle of Yuguan, in order to commemorate him and comfort his loyal soul. The case was recorded and submitted to the Municipal Government for approval. The Municipal Government handed it over to the Municipal Bureau of Public Works for review. The Bureau of Public Works replied that the road name already had a considerable history, and changing the name would be very troublesome. It should wait until a new road is built before using Andexin as the name. The Municipal Government has approved and notified accordingly.</p>

<p>The case of Daxing Company suing Youcheng Company for the return of real estate and compensation for damages, which was accepted by the Shanghai First Special District Local Court, was handled by Judge Shen Hong. It had been tried twice and was scheduled to be pronounced on the 25th of this month. Unexpectedly, at 11:30 a.m. on the 22nd, while Judge Shen was working in the court, two people claiming to be surnamed Li and Gu sent a letter to Judge Shen's residence, stating that they wanted to see Mrs. Shen. After Mrs. Shen came out to meet them, they handed over the letter and left immediately, without being asked where they came from. The letter stated "To Mr. Shen Hong for receipt", and was signed "Respectfully from Ni Yunlai, representative of Daxing Company", containing banknotes worth 1,000 yuan, along with a note. Mrs. Shen was bewildered and immediately called Judge Shen to inquire. It happened that Judge Shen was busy with official business. He returned home from work in the afternoon and learned about it. He was deeply astonished and immediately reported to President Guo of the court. President Guo believed that the parties involved in the lawsuit dared to bribe the judge, which was a blatant disregard for the law. He handed over the original letter and the 1,000 yuan to the procuratorate for strict investigation according to the law. It is reported that arrest warrants have been issued and arrests are underway.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning at around 8 o'clock, a kidnapping case occurred near the intersection of Avenue du President Haig and Rue Massenet in the French Concession. The victim was Sheng Xie Gui, a Ningbo native and the Chinese General Manager of Yunfei Motors, and Vice President of the Shanghai Rental Car Industry Association. When the news spread, all the cars of Yunfei Motors' head office and branches, as well as all the police cars in the Chinese and French concessions, were mobilized to search for the bandits' car, but as of late at night, there was still no trace of it. The details are recorded below:</p>

<p>Yunfei Rental Motors Company in this city is one of the leading car rental companies in Shanghai. In addition to the head office located on Avenue du President Haig in the French Concession, there are nine branches in Pudong, Punan, and other places, with a total of nearly 200 cars. The Chinese General Manager of the head office is Sheng Xiegui, a Ningbo native. Sheng is 46 years old and has been working for the company for many years. Because he is usually capable in his work and diligent, he has gradually risen from a small staff member to his current position. Sheng is responsible for the management of the Chinese part of the company. Yunfei's success today is largely due to Sheng's efforts. Because he is trusted by the people, he was also elected as the Vice President of the Shanghai Rental Car Industry Association.</p>

<p>Sheng's home is located at 124-126 Avenue du President Haig near Rue Massenet, close to Yunfei's head office. At 8:50 yesterday morning, after Sheng finished breakfast, he went to the office as usual. He walked out of his residence alone and proceeded along Avenue du President Haig across Rue Massenet. When he arrived near the Avenue Haig Villas, he suddenly saw a young man in a suit holding a newspaper, leaning against the wall and silently reciting. When Sheng approached him, the young man suddenly drew a gun, forbade him from making a sound, and forced Sheng back to the corner of Avenue Massenet and Avenue du President Haig. A green Chevrolet bandit car was parked there in advance, with four bandits lying in the car.</p>

<p>At that time, the four bandits in the car saw that the victim was already in their hands, so they all drew their guns and forced Sheng into the car. One bandit drove, and drove straight into Avenue du President Haig, turned west, and sped past the entrance of Yunfei's head office. At that time, an old storekeeper named A Long was working in the company and had been serving in the company for many years. He was very alert. He happened to be returning to the company and unintentionally caught a glimpse of Sheng, his face pale, being held in the car by five unfamiliar young men in suits, heading west. A Long knew something was wrong and rushed to report to the company. A Westerner manager heard the news and immediately called the French Concession Police Station, the various police stations in the Public Concession, and the district offices of the Public Security Bureau to request a pursuit.</p>

<p>The manager then ordered all Yunfei branches to mobilize all their vehicles to search for the bandits' car. For a time, police cars and Yunfei cars were all over the city, but as of the afternoon, there was still no trace of them. It is reported that Sheng has been working for Yunfei for nearly 20 years. In addition to his wife, he has two sons and a daughter. The eldest son, Zhonghan, is 18 years old and is studying at Chengzhong Middle School on Tangshan Road. The second son, Xinghan, and the young daughter, Yuanyuan, are still young. Sheng's younger brother has passed away, and his brother's wife, nephews, and nieces all rely on Sheng alone for their livelihood. This kidnapping has led to speculation that the purpose is not money but something else special.</p>

<p>Guowen News Agency reported that April 8th of the lunar calendar, commonly known as the Bathing Buddha Festival, is the date when the annual fair is held in front of the Jing'an Temple on Jing'an Temple Road in this city. Along both sides of the road, various vendors set up temporary shops, which is what the villagers call catching the fair. During this period, not only do tourists gather from all directions, but also the incense of Jing'an Temple is continuous day and night. Most vendors earn several months' worth of food at this fair. Last year, the Municipal Council banned the fair because it hindered traffic, but this year, after villagers requested it, it is still being held as usual. Yesterday, although the festival had not yet arrived, temporary sheds had been erected along the road, as dense as combs. Furniture made of rattan, bamboo, and wood was piled up into a market. People walking in it felt as if they were hundreds of miles away from Shanghai. The incense pilgrims and sightseers in Jing'an Temple were already extremely crowded yesterday. The police temporarily dispatched Indian mounted police and foreign police to patrol back and forth. This custom has been going on for many years. In the past, villagers would go to Jing'an Temple to burn incense during the Bathing Buddha Festival and come to sell the goods they had made throughout the year. Gradually, some stayed permanently and only returned to their villages after the fair was over. The monks in charge of Jing'an Temple collected rent from this, and the income was used for charitable causes, such as providing medical care in the summer and school expenses. This has become a custom, and the annual gathering has been unchanged until now.</p>

It is reported that the board of directors has decided to appoint Guo Shun, the General Manager of Wing On Textile Company, as the Supervisor, as he is familiar with commercial affairs and capable. Guo Lingshuang was promoted to General Manager, and Guo Le's son, Guo Yuewen, was promoted to Deputy Manager. The colleagues of the company felt that they had found the right person, and yesterday, important staff representatives of the colleagues held a public banquet at the Dadong Restaurant to express their congratulations. At two o'clock, the toasts were exchanged, and it was a grand occasion.</p>

<p>大刦工作塲</p>
<p>A Westerner named Jiang Sen of Meihua Real Estate Company purchased several acres of land on the side of Zhongshan Road near Hongqiao Road in western Shanghai and built three tall and magnificent residential villas. Construction has been underway for several months, and the project is now 60% complete and is being rushed to completion. Unexpectedly, at about 1:10 a.m. yesterday morning, a large number of bandits, 40 to 50 people, armed with eight or nine handguns and two wooden-cased guns, broke through the bamboo fence from the south and rushed in. They first fired two shots into the sky to intimidate, then five bandits guarded the night watchman Pan Ciyuan, and more than ten bandits guarded the masons Gu Amao and Zhang Asan next to the site. The remaining bandits then searched and looted. After about an hour, more than 300 pieces of five-cent plywood, about 500 feet of white lead water pipes, and more than 40 pieces of silk and cloth clothing belonging to the workers were looted. After carrying away the stolen goods, the bandits still fled south. When the leader of the Criminal Investigation Team of Western Shanghai, Xia Pinshan, and Deputy Leader Tang Bingxiang received the report, they immediately led the detectives to pursue them, but the bandits had already fled far away. After inspecting the scene, they found 37 pieces of the original stolen plywood abandoned by the bandits on Zhongshan Road, about a mile away. Subsequently, the Westerner Jiang Sen of the company opened a list and reported to the Sixth District Police Station, requesting a strict crackdown on the stolen goods and bandits.</p>

<p>Ch'u Shao-ch'ing, a building contractor, submitted an application to the French Municipal Council on February 24th of this year, requesting a permit to build the Nanhua Banquet Hall and Guohua Cinema (buildings) at the corner of Avenue Edward VII and Rue Grosse (i.e., Songshan Road). After the Municipal Council forwarded the application to the French General Police Station, the Investigation Team of the Seventh Group sent Chinese Detective Cai A-san, also known as Xiao Maogou, No. 119, to investigate. After reporting back to the Western supervisor, on March 12th and 13th, Detective Cai was ordered to summon Ch'u to the police station's office. When the group leader questioned him about the construction situation, Cai took the opportunity to demand a reward of 500 yuan from Ch'u, saying that it could expedite the issuance of the license. Now, Ch'u reported the information to the police station. Upon receiving the report, the police chief believed that Cai dared to solicit rewards from people, which was a dereliction of duty. He dismissed Cai from his position, ordered him to be detained, and yesterday, he was transferred to the Second Special District Court for prosecution. At 3:30 in the afternoon, Criminal Judge Wang Gangxu presided over Criminal Court One for interrogation. First, police lawyer Fei Xizhen stated the case, indicting him according to Article 128 of the Criminal Law. Then, the plaintiff stated the circumstances of the case. When the defendant Cai A-san was questioned, he denied soliciting rewards from the plaintiff and hired lawyers Zhu Dianqing and Ge Zhizhen to defend him. According to the witness, translator Jin Miaoquan, he testified in court that he had heard the defendant and the plaintiff talking about money in the writing room, but he did not understand what kind of money it was. After examining the confessions, the court ordered a change of date for further interrogation. The defendant was ordered to provide a surety who could be summoned at any time to await further instructions.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Tobacco Exchange Association is located at No. 487 Zhongwang Lane, Ningbo Road, in the Public Concession. The upper floor is rented to the family members of the owner of Xin Changtai Company. Yesterday afternoon at about 12:15, the maid employed by Xin Changtai Company was carrying the tableware down from the upper floor, intending to wash it by the tap, when she suddenly saw a young man wearing a long gown standing face to face with the wall at the back door of the house, not leaving for a long time. The maid felt very strange, so she walked out of the back door to investigate and saw that the young man was pressing his head against the wall, with bloodstains all over the ground. She pushed him, but he did not move or respond, only shaking his head slightly. The maid was terrified and rushed upstairs to report everything to the owner and told the people in the Tobacco Exchange Association to come out and see what was going on. The people in the association ran out of Zhongwang Lane and reported to the nearby police station at No. 1713 to come and see. It was then discovered that the young man's throat had been cut with a knife, and he was still holding a small foreign knife tightly in his hand. The police urgently hired a car to take him to Dehe Hospital for treatment. It is reported that the injuries were very serious and his life may be in danger. It was later learned that the young man's surname was Li, his name was Bochao, he was from Dongyang, Zhejiang, and he had studied at the China Public School. It is still difficult to guess why he had such a sudden intention. We must wait until he recovers before we can ask him what happened.</p>

<p>▲Mr. Wang Jin's "On Chinese Criminal Law" Mr. Wang Shuping, since the early years of the Republic of China, studied in Japan and has been intensely passionate about criminal law. He personally learned from famous Japanese scholars, grasping their essence and principles. After returning to China, he lectured at various universities in Peiping, offering unique interpretations, referencing new theories, and providing comparative evaluations of the merits and demerits of Chinese criminal law. In addition to his lectures, he authored "On Chinese Criminal Law," a book of over a thousand pages, totaling more than fifty thousand words. This monumental work is unmatched in its time. Soon after publication, readers rushed to purchase it. Consequently, the first volume has been printed seven times in just a few years, while the middle and lower volumes have reached their fourth edition. The entire set of three volumes is priced at four yuan, six jiao, and two fen. Now, as a special offer to readers, a discounted price of 20% off is being offered. It is reported that the books have already been shipped to Shanghai and are being sold on consignment at the Pei Wen Zhai Bookstore, located at the west end of Guangxi Road on Sanma Road.</p>

<h3 id="e202">Shanghai Pudong Fellow Villagers Association's Declaration on Raising Funds to Purchase Land and Build a Clubhouse <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>Our Shanghai Pudong Fellow Villagers Association was founded in August of the 20th year of the Republic of China. At that time, there was a proposal to build a clubhouse, but it was not carried out because a suitable site for purchasing land had not been found. In recent months, we have found a site east of the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Chengdu Road, with an area of nearly three mu. We have decided to raise funds to purchase it and build a clubhouse at the same time. Mr. Huang Yanpei wrote an article to inform our elders, brothers, sisters, and cousins from our hometown, saying that the national crisis is urgent. Why are we building this civil engineering project? We do not know that the construction of the clubhouse of our fellow villagers association is precisely to save the country from its crisis. China has a population of over 470 million, yet it has been repeatedly insulted by Japan, which has a population of less than 70 million. Over 3.87 million square miles of land have been occupied and cannot be recovered. More than 33 million people have been massacred and forced to be managed and cannot be rescued. Although there are many reasons for this, the main reason is the lack of unity. Now, if we really want to save China from its crisis, we must have principles and methods. One essential condition is that everyone must abandon their selfish and self-interested individual views, first form small groups, then combine several small groups into large groups, and then combine several large groups into one large national group. When the one large national group is formed, the foundation of the country will be established, the strength of the country will be strong, and the life of the country will be eternal. What is Japan? It is not worth following or mentioning. How do we start forming small groups? Human affection is most easily expressed in sincerity and love when people leave their hometowns. Therefore, the combination of natives in one place is often not as large and solid as the formation of a group of compatriots in a foreign land based on the relationship of "fellow travelers in a foreign land." Shanghai is the transportation center of East Asia, and this example is particularly evident. Looking at the city's population of 3.84 million, how much strength can be shown, and what group of fellow villagers is considered important at one time? All are non-native groups. Taking a step further, observing several non-native groups, which one can be considered more powerful? We know that the answer will be unanimous and without hesitation: Ningbo people, Ningbo people! Ningbo people are also Chinese citizens. Is it that they are naturally endowed with a particularly strong and solid unity? There must be a reason for this. In the second year of the Jiaqing reign of the Qing Dynasty (1797 AD), the leaders of the Ningbo people who were merchants and workers in Shanghai initiated a proposal, and the masses responded below, creating the Siming Public Hall. Over time, the scale gradually expanded, and the benefits to their fellow villagers became increasingly complete. When they first came to Shanghai, they were provided with accommodation. When they were sick, they were provided with medical care. When they died, they were provided with burial. With the relationship of relatives, friends, neighbors, and fellow villagers, they were introduced to jobs. They celebrated each other's happy events and offered condolences. They helped each other and showed compassion in times of trouble. What people seek from the group is only to live in peace and enjoy their lives. With such a group, how can it not become a gathering in one year, a village in two years, and a city in three years? Twenty years ago, the Ningbo people established the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association, and soon a great building was completed, providing education for those seeking knowledge. The Siming Public Hall was mostly for the working class, while this was mostly for the intellectual class. Since the opening of Shanghai as a port, the Ningbo people have held the reins. Now the number of people has increased to one million, accounting for almost one-third of the city's population. In the 13th year of the Tongzhi reign (1874) and the 24th year of the Guangxu reign (1898), when their tombs were encroached upon for road construction, the masses resisted one after another. In a weak country, they ultimately made the Westerners yield. Any group that can gather strength to treat its members well like this will inevitably become strong and large. Is it only the Ningbo people who are like this? If the Ningbo fellow villagers did not have a vast site of tens of acres, facing the Republic of China Road, crossing the Baliqiao Road, and west of Mintiniyin Road, and a magnificent building of tens of feet high towering on Xizang Road, without this organization, the cause would not be so broad, the people would not be so numerous, and the unity would not be so solid. The Ningbo fellow villagers took the lead, and all those who wanted to strengthen and enlarge their groups followed suit, encouraging and striving forward, dividing into powerful public groups in one direction, and uniting into a whole organic body, using it for self-reliance and to face the outside world. The direct and indirect impact on the survival and development of the country and the nation is unlimited. Our Pudong fellow villagers deeply believe in the irrefutable theory and the powerful precedent, and gather to discuss and plan to make a concerted effort to gather all sectors of knowledge and labor, and on the selected site, combine the strength of the group to build the great building of the future. We have hired fellow villagers who are skilled in architectural design to design it carefully and in detail. It will have several floors, several rooms, several halls, and several halls. The land and house will cost about 400,000 yuan in total. It was decided that those who donate more than one hundred yuan will have their names inscribed, those who donate more than one thousand yuan will have their portraits hung on the wall, those who donate enough five thousand yuan will have a room named after them, those who donate enough ten thousand yuan will have a hall named after them, and those who donate more than thirty thousand yuan will have a hall named after them. At this point in the discussion, Mr. Du Yuesheng rolled up his sleeves and said, "Please allow me to donate the most money for the hall," doubling the amount offered. Everyone responded enthusiastically, saying, "Wonderful! Please build the largest hall in the center with Mr. Du's donation and name it Du Hall, to celebrate Mr. Du's birthday. The largest hall is named Du Hall, and the hometown pronunciation of 'large' is similar to 'Du'." In the future, when people pass by Avenue Edward VII and see the magnificent building with old and young men and women entering and exiting by the thousands, they will be settled when they first arrive, educated when they seek knowledge, introduced when they seek employment, and provided with medical care when they are sick. They will celebrate each other's happy events and offer condolences. They will help each other and show compassion in times of trouble. In peacetime, they will meet and talk and hold meetings. In their leisure time, they will be entertained. Listen to the dialect they speak, all of which are Pudong hometown sounds. Without looking up to see the plaque, they will already know that it is the Pudong Fellow Villagers Association. The public and private affairs of the Pudong people are developing day by day, and their contribution to society and the country is becoming more and more great. The foundation of the country will be established, the strength of the country will be strong, and the life of the country will be eternal. From then on, there will be no more national crises. All of this is the gift of Mr. Du and our elders, brothers, sisters, and cousins from our hometown. Mr. Huang Yanpei recalled that at that time, he was ordered to write the article and actually carried out the task of the devil, and he was also honored to participate in it, and he would not dare to be selfish. April of the 20th year of the Republic of China, Huang Yanpei.</p>
<h3 id="e203">Reader Consultant <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>A collection of letters discussing the question of (Can one go back to the countryside?) (19) A letter from Mr. Liu Zhaomin of this city丨A reply to Mr. Zhu Tianqing Today I read Mr. Zhu Tianqing's letter in this column, saying that he "found that I was showing off my writing to irritate people," and also said that I "occupied the space of the reader consultant for nothing." Regarding the latter, I want to apologize to the readers of this column, and I feel really uneasy. As for this letter replying to Mr. Zhu Tianqing, I didn't want to write it anymore, because I was afraid that my "unskilled in rhetoric" and "specially fond of showing off" writing would "irritate" Mr. Zhu, and no one would go to the countryside to build a "new paradise" in the future! However, I cannot avoid this suspicion of "specially showing off writing to irritate people" and give up my right to discuss. Moreover, Mr. You's qualifications as a "leading figure" who feels the pain of the countryside, the first is "literate and able to write." I criticize your writing with the construction of words, but I have offended you. Let's not talk about that, let's ask for Mr. Zhu's teachings again. (1) "The most important thing about the suffering of Chinese farmers is that they have no knowledge." The most powerful part of Mr. Zhu's sentence is the word "indeed." In fact, there is no such easy thing. Mr. Zhu, this sentence fully expresses your demeanor of chatting "sitting comfortably on the sofa," and you don't know the suffering of the farmers at all. This doesn't require you to talk about theory, nor does it require the ability to "read and write," let alone rhetoric. As long as you are willing to give up your blessings and go to the bankrupt and vast countryside for a trip, tell the farmers that you have no knowledge, and you are very painful, and you have no education, and you are very painful. If the farmers don't treat you as a madman, then I will lose. But if you want to ask them, do you feel painful if you don't have food to eat? The farmers will definitely answer immediately, of course. The current pain of the farmers is really not a question of whether they know knowledge or not, or whether they are educated or not, but that the whole family is hungry, and their wives, children, old and young are crying for food. This is a common fact in the Chinese countryside. You need to know that Mr. You's advice to people to return to the countryside is not only theoretically untenable, but his method is also completely based on his ignorance of the real situation in the countryside. Although there are chickens and eggs in the countryside, the current "chickens and 'eggs'" are different from those decades ago. A chicken sold to the city can get more than one yuan, and an egg sells for sixty or seventy yuan. They are reluctant to eat it themselves and want to exchange it for money to buy seeds and pay off debts. They only eat sweet potatoes, beet sugar, and flour. Where can they get "reading chickens" or "thirty eggs" or "one yuan" to give you? Moreover, the children in the countryside (we are naturally talking about the poor tenant farmers and hired farmers) have to go to graze cattle, collect manure, and pick up firewood for their families when they are seven or eight years old. They even have to be sent to the rich farmers' homes to graze cattle in exchange for a bowl of rice to eat. Where can they have the leisure to let their children read this unlucky book and receive this unlucky education that cannot be eaten when they are hungry and cannot be clothed when they are cold? Moreover, you already know that "the reason why rural education in China is not developed is because 'politics is not on track, warlords are fighting internally, communists are disturbing everywhere, foreign capitalist forces are invading, and there are excessive taxes, etc. These frequently cause great blows to the countryside and make farmers and the countryside bankrupt. Almost all poor farmers are too busy to take care of themselves, so how can they take care of rural education?'" You should work hard on these reasons, which is the right thing to do. Why don't you talk about the real problems of these reasons head-on, but talk about rural education in mid-air? Under the current situation of what you call "politics not on track, warlords fighting internally..." etc., what practical and broad significance and effect can there be in using rural education to treat the head when it hurts and the foot when it hurts?</p>

<h3 id="e204">Besides Jade Legs and Creamy Bosoms <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Xuan</p>
<p>During the January 28th Incident, Shanghai's cinemas were truly closed for several days. Later, after the "bedside agreement" was signed, "forgetting entertainment while saving the country," or "saving the country while not forgetting entertainment," the cinemas resumed their former prosperity.</p>
<p>However, films that specialize in "jade legs and creamy bosoms" have been heavily criticized! Because these lewd and sensual films can wear away the ambition to resist Japan and save the country.</p>
<p>At the same time, martial arts and superstitious films have also been criticized! Because these feudal-minded films can numb people's minds.</p>
<p>At the same time, the saying that movies are a sharp weapon for mass education has been shouted even louder. For a time, everyone was demanding films that promote national spirit, films that promote domestic products, or films that promote hard work in production. Film companies were also busy changing direction. Although it came late, after the first anniversary of the January 28th Incident, we finally saw these brand-new films such as "Torrent," "Night in the City," and "Three Modern Women." It is said that these films can indeed compete with imported "jade legs and creamy bosoms." But right now we are in the "War of Resistance Against Japan." The people should have the determination to "resist to the end." The people should know how the soldiers on the front line are "fighting bloody battles" and quickly and enthusiastically transport supplies. Naturally, there is still not enough with only "Torrent" and so on! Naturally, we must produce several "War of Resistance Against Japan" films!</p>
<p>This is a consistent demand from top to bottom! And those above are already preparing.</p>
<p>However, we have seen several scenes of the "War of Resistance Against Japan." The most unforgettable of these is the escape of General Tang Yulin. This is not a "refreshing" program, so it is unlikely to be adopted. Then, what will be adopted is probably the victory at Xifengkou, the bravery of the Big Sword Team, with a magnificent name such as "Give Me Back My Rivers and Mountains." In this way, the people will know that they have indeed "resisted" and will not forget "give me back," and they will naturally be extremely grateful!</p>
<p>This is opening up new paths other than "jade legs and creamy bosoms" and "martial arts and superstition," which is enough to make the people put down one hundred and twenty-four hearts and wait drunkenly for the final victory of the "long-term resistance"!</p>
<h3 id="e205">What to do when returning to the countryside? <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Xingzhi</p>
<p>丨Reply to Mr. Cao Juren</p>
<p>The other day, I published an article entitled "Returning to the Countryside and Eating Meat Paste" in this magazine. The main purpose of this article is to point out that the proposition of returning to the countryside to create a "Shangri-La" is not only a Utopian dream, but also a smoke screen containing a strong anesthetic and deceptive nature. Because it cleverly plants a beautiful hope in the minds of the masses, it pulls the masses away from reality, and it shifts the goals of the masses to another illusion. Of course, we should "firmly oppose" such a proposition of returning to the countryside.</p>
<p>However, due to space limitations, I only said half of what I wanted to say in the previous article. In fact, I am also in favor of returning to the countryside, because people who are unemployed and cannot live in the city, have no A-brand sterilized milk to eat, and have no possibility of drinking, playing mahjong, or filling in "liberation lyrics," can "damn the national affairs," but their own affairs cannot be "damned." If they want to "manage," they have to return to the countryside. There are many things in the countryside waiting for us to start, and many partners are waving to us. Naturally, we should return to the countryside to find a "way out." Just squeezing in the city is just waiting to die, just "escaping." I was planning to write another article to supplement the unfinished meaning of the previous article. It just so happened that Mr. Cao Juren first came up with a "biased defense of returning to the countryside" and expressed "dissent" to my previous article. I think this disagreement is very meaningful.</p>
<p>However, I am still not satisfied with Mr. Cao's disagreement. On the contrary, I still want to express "firm opposition." Because Mr. Cao's proposition of returning to the countryside is just a new annotation to the previous proposition, and the mistakes made are no different from the former, and such "amelioration theory" may be more vicious in its effect than the former. Whether Mr. Cao's proposition is out of "consciousness" or not, the resulting errors are the same.</p>
<p>Why? First, Mr. Cao divides the current Chinese countryside into three types, A, B, and C, and believes that returning to type C countryside "will never be disappointed." This is a huge mistake. Because he stubbornly divides the "entire" capitalist world, the "entire" colony, and the entire collapsing countryside into three types of regions that are not connected and seem to be able to "exist independently," and ignores the reasons for the current collapse of the countryside and its trends. He seems to believe that the soil in the upper reaches of the Qiantang River is a "blessed land" that is "free from exploitative relations," "unaffected by political and economic factors," and "will never collapse," which can accommodate all the unemployed and build a "kingdom" of self-cultivating farmers. But is this really the case? This is Mr. Cao's mistake one.</p>
<p>Second, Mr. Cao seems to believe that "self-cultivating farmer economy" is the most ideal solution to the land problem and the most satisfactory destination for the peasant problem. This kind of "recognition" may inevitably be a serious mistake, and he excludes many agricultural proletarians from the circle and advocates "organizing self-cultivating farmers alone to fight a self-defense war" to resist the erosion of capitalist economy and the sucking of corrupt local bullies to maintain this "blessed land." This is especially a big mistake. Furthermore, Mr. Cao's self-defense method is "to help self-cultivating farmers form a strong national system to collectively farm in order to realize agricultural electrification, so that self-cultivating farmers can keep their own land and their own machinery." In these few words, there are plans, organizations, struggles, industrial revolutions, agricultural revolutions, and perhaps an independent regime. It is great, but can this great project be undertaken by thousands or tens of thousands of "self-cultivating farmers" in the upper reaches of the Qiantang River? This is Mr. Cao's mistake two.</p>
<p>Third, Mr. Cao said: "Let's see the efforts made by consumer cooperatives in the progress of the Soviet revolution." That's right, consumer cooperatives have indeed played a considerable role in the Soviet revolution - no, in the construction process of the Soviet socialist economy. However, that is only in the "Soviet Union!" Oranges will become trifoliate oranges when they cross the Huai River. The Five-Year Plan cannot be implemented by any country! This is Mr. Cao's mistake three.</p>
<p>With these three mistakes, Mr. Cao's "disagreement" is still just a smoke screen, an illusion.</p>
<p>However, in the end, I still advocate "returning to the countryside," because there are many partners in the countryside waving to us, and there are many things waiting for us to start.</p>

<p>— Ba Jin</p>
<p>丨To My Brother丨 (Continued)</p>
<p>You have returned to the North. In these past eight years, we haven't been together for even a month in total. Now, I am about to embark on a life of wandering. It seems that there will be no more time for us to gather quietly in my hopes. Last night, at a friend's house, I told you: I want to find an opportunity to stake my young life on a single throw. I want to do something exhilarating, even if it means destroying my entire life without hesitation. You didn't say anything at the time; you just smiled slightly.</p>
<p>Perhaps you wouldn't understand this situation. "Why should you abandon the writing life?" In your mind, this question cannot be answered. But in fact, you know that I haven't written anything for three whole months. I would rather spend my time on the streets, in trains, and at friends' houses, wasting my young life. But the opportunity I hoped for never appeared, and people outside are saying in articles, as if shooting arrows in the dark, that I am already lamenting that my pen is about to run dry.</p>
<p>Of course, you wouldn't believe such rumors. We have spent nearly twenty years of life together; you know how faithfully I have experienced all of this. My beliefs, my character—you know them very well. I have never finished writing what I wanted to write, and I have never let the mist cloud my eyes. I am still alive now, not lying down, yet people are using all kinds of rumors to bury me. I have never uttered a protest against these rumors. I only have bitter smiles; I only have groans.</p>
<p>These groans, these bitter smiles, are piling up on my shoulders. For two years, they have piled up so high, and now they leave such a long shadow behind me. I am gradually beginning to hate my name. At first, I said I loved my writing, but now that my writing has been ruined enough by others, I also hate my writing. I am still struggling in the darkness, my eyes looking towards the unreachable light ahead, and my writing is almost suffocating me, my name is almost destroying my faith, my character. Today, I can no longer smile bitterly; I can no longer groan. I say all of this should end.</p>
<p>When I first dedicated myself to writing, I was full of faith; I was full of hope. I regarded writing as a part of my life, and I walked the path of writing with a faithful attitude. I was determined: I would not become a literati. You know that I have always hated literati. We often said that we shouldn't become literati in the future because literati are either direct plunderers or tools of plunderers. We were accustomed to seeing the ugliness of literati in our childhood. Who knew that cruel fate would actually cause me to be regarded as a literati today, and everything we hated has been added to me. Rumors, exploitation, manipulation, attacks, flattery—for the past two years, they have surrounded me, surrounding me so tightly that I cannot breathe a breath of free air. There was a time when I even suspected that I was about to enter the grave.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, I wrote my "Cry of the Soul." That article was written last autumn when we met in Tianjin, in your colleague's small room. After it was published in a certain magazine in Shanghai, a friend who I had never met read it and shed tears of pity, saying that he didn't expect my life to be so painful.</p>
<p>In that article, I said that I wanted to end my literary life. But after I returned from the North, my life fell into more rumors, exploitation, manipulation, attacks, and flattery. These insults, accompanied by illness, pressed me down so that I couldn't move. I lay in bed for several days, and I thought about my life before I wrote novels. I thought about the few teachers I admired in life, and my heart was tormented by regret. A voice rang in my ears: "You can live like this again. You should stand up and be a brave person!"</p>
<p>That's right, I am too weak! As a "writing person," I am indeed too weak! For the past two years, I have let all insults be added to me, and I have never uttered a protest. I have smiled bitterly and groaned too many times. I traveled the so-called Chinese literary world with a child-like innocent heart. I believed in everyone, and I loved all my friends. And then all kinds of things happened that made me smile bitterly and groan: "To be continued"</p>

<p>— Jules Renard, Translated by Lin Qu</p>
<p>Chamber Pot (Two)</p>
<p>He woke up suddenly, listening to his stomach.</p>
<p>"Ah! Ah! This is bad!" he said.</p>
<p>He thought he had gotten away with it. He had been too lucky. He really shouldn't have been lazy last night. Now the punishment is really about to come.</p>
<p>He sat on the bed, pondering. The door had already been locked from the outside with a key. The windows were barred. It was impossible to get out. Yet he still got up and felt the door and the bars on the window. He crawled on the ground, reaching under the bed with his hand, searching for the chamber pot that he knew very well wasn't there.</p>
<p>He lay down and got up again. He would rather move, walk, and stamp his feet than lie down. He rubbed his swollen stomach with both fists.</p>
<p>"Mama! Mama!" he called softly, afraid that others would hear. Because if Mrs. Lepic came, she would immediately say that nothing was wrong and that he was deliberately joking with her. He called like this only so that he could say tomorrow without a guilty conscience that he had called her.</p>
<p>And how could he shout loudly? All his strength was used to make the disaster happen a little slower.</p>
<p>Before long, a very severe pain made Carrot Top dance. He leaned tightly against the wall and then jumped away. He leaned tightly against the bed rail. He leaned tightly against the chair. He leaned tightly against the fireplace. He violently pulled open the iron plate in front of the fireplace. He squatted down, curled up in a ball. He surrendered. He was suddenly extremely happy.</p>
<p>The room was even darker.</p>
<p>Chamber Pot (Three)</p>
<p>Carrot Top didn't fall asleep again until dawn. In the morning, Mrs. Lepic seemed to smell something outside and came in with a strange face, pushing open the door, while he was still not up.</p>
<p>"What a strange smell!" she said.</p>
<p>"Good morning, Mama!" Carrot Top said.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lepic pulled off the sheets, sniffing all over the room, and found it in a short time.</p>
<p>"I felt unwell last night, and there was no chamber pot in the room," Carrot Top said quickly, thinking that this was the best way to defend himself.</p>
<p>"Liar! Liar!" Mrs. Lepic said.</p>
<p>She ran out, secretly brought in a chamber pot, and quickly stuffed it under the bed. She dragged Carrot Top up, called everyone in the family, and shouted:</p>
<p>"What sins have I committed to have such a child?"</p>
<p>She sometimes brought rags and a bucket of water, as if putting out a fire, and flooded the entire fireplace. She shook the bedding and called for air! Let in air! Busy and complaining.</p>
<p>She sometimes pointed at Carrot Top's nose and said:</p>
<p>"Damn thing! Have you lost your senses! You're acting abnormally! You're acting like an animal! We give a chamber pot to an animal, and it knows how to use it. But you, you want to roll in the ashes of the fireplace. God knows, you've made me confused. I'm going crazy, crazy, crazy!"</p>
<p>Carrot Top, barefoot and wearing a nightgown, stared at the chamber pot. There was no chamber pot last night, but now there was a chamber pot under the bed. This empty, clean chamber pot made him dizzy. If he insisted on pretending not to see it, that would be too insensible.</p>
<p>His family had already made a mess, and some neighbors with mocking expressions, as well as the postman who delivered the correspondence, all joked with him and asked him many questions.</p>
<p>"I swear to you!" Carrot Top finally replied, looking at the chamber pot. "I, I'm simply baffled. Do whatever you want with me."</p>

<p>The Second Municipal Inter-School Sports Meet, organized by the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education, officially opened at the China Athletic Field on Rue du Père Huc yesterday afternoon.

More than sixty schools participated, with more than four thousand athletes and students participating in the mass exercises. The weather was fine, the wind was gentle, and the entire field was crowded with people, with colorful flags waving and cheers thundering, creating a magnificent scene. Visitors flocked in, and the streets around Rue du Père Huc were jammed with traffic. The sports competitions were orderly and neat. The staff served enthusiastically, and the athletes were full of spirit. The order in the venue was slightly lacking in discipline. The track and field events were all preliminary and semi-final rounds, and the results were acceptable. The field events were all finals. There were seven events for men and women in total. Today's program is even more important than yesterday's, and it is expected to be even more interesting. The grand occasion of yesterday is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Grand Opening</p>
<h3 id="e209">A Glimpse Before the Opening <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>At 1:00 PM, under the warm sunshine, the China Athletic Field was filled with enthusiastic people. Colorful flags fluttered across the field, dazzling the eyes. The loudspeaker first announced the gathering of male and female students from various schools in order to assemble in the center of the track and field, quietly awaiting the mass exercises. The male and female athletes were lined up on the track. The audience was densely packed around the field, impenetrable. At that time, the heads of ten thousand people were moving, and the voices were boiling. How magnificent! How magnificent!</p>
<h3 id="e210">Circumambulating the Venue <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>After the athletes and mass exercise students were arranged, the parade began. It started from in front of the main platform. The Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau military band led the way, followed by the staff of the meet, and then the male and female athletes from various schools, who were estimated to occupy three-quarters of the 400-meter track, marching forward to the beat. The sound of footsteps and music were mixed together, and the atmosphere was solemn and magnificent.</p>

<p>After the parade was over, they reassembled in front of the main platform and performed the opening ceremony. After the ceremony, President Wu Tiecheng delivered the opening speech in a clear, concise, impassioned, and extremely pleasing tone.

<p>And we want to use it to resist our enemies and achieve the goal of recovering lost territory. Physical education is the foundation of all kinds of undertakings. The survival of the country and the nation depends on the bright strength to resist our opponents, and the creation of this strength depends entirely on you young people. The annual sports meet is to test how our usual training is.</p>

<h3 id="e219">Overview of Field Events <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>▲ Boys Group A Shot Put Due to the excessive number of participants, it was divided into groups A and B, and then the results of the two groups were combined to determine the winner. Sun Yongbin of Guanghua Affiliated Middle School won the championship with 11.43 meters. The results of the other three are: (2) Huang Jianfei of Daxia, 11.11 meters; (3) Wang Deyuan of Daxia, 10.85 meters; (4) Shen Tianji of Fudan, 10.75 meters. The differences are very small.</p>
<p>▲ Boys Group B High Jump More than 30 people jumped, and the last four were Wei Zengshan of Shanghai Provincial Middle School, Liu Guangxu of Guangzhao, and Cheng Zujun and Zhong Delin of Nanyang. When the height was raised to 1.44 meters, Cheng and Zhong were eliminated. Wei and Liu were at 1.44 meters, but with the addition of the rollback, Wei got first and Liu got second. Cheng and Zhong competed for the result, Cheng was third and Zhong was fourth.</p>
<p>Girls Group A Long Jump Wu Meixian came after being eliminated in the 100-meter race and took the best result with 4.18 meters. In the last three jumps, she improved to 4.26 meters. (2) Dai Pu improved from 3.77 meters to 3.95 meters. (3) Lu Meiyun improved from 3.67 meters to 3.80 meters. (4) Chen Liuzhen got 3.79 meters, only 0.01 meters away from Lu Meiyun. Wu Meixian can accelerate when running, and the result can be even better.</p>
<p>▲ Girls Group B Long Jump Guan Yanjiao of Patriotic won the championship, with 3.79 meters in the fourth jump. (2) Rong Shujian got 3.71 meters in the fifth jump. (3) Li Yuhe got 3.69 meters in the first jump. (4) Huang Jingzong got 3.66 meters in the fifth jump. The distances are all very close.</p>
<p>▲ Men's Physical High Jump There were only five people in total. Zhang Jiakui of Jiangnan won first place with 1.585 meters. The other four were from Dongya. The results of the second, third, and fourth were all equal, so they rolled back to determine the order of points.</p>
<p>▲ Men's Physical Shot Put There were also only five people in total. The recorded results of the four were: (1) He Zuxi of Dongya, 11.59 meters; (2) Li Kongde of Dongya, 10.84 meters; (3) Zhao Bingzhao of Jiangnan, 10.69 meters; (4) Zhang Qiting of Dongya, 10.30 meters.</p>
<p>▲ Women's Physical Long Jump Chen Baixue of Liangjiang improved from 4.25 meters to 4.42 meters in the last jump. (2) Chen Shuqing of Dongya got 4.40 meters in the fourth jump. (3) Qian Hangsu of Dongya got 4.37 meters in the fourth jump. (4) Zou Shande of Southeast, 4.11 meters.</p>
<h3 id="e220">Track Race Report <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>▲ Wu Meixian Fined Twice Ms. Wu Meixian is one of the four heroines of the former Harbin, and has attended national and Far Eastern sports meets. She is a well-known figure in the sports world. Ms. Wu is currently studying at Fudan Practical Middle School, so she was able to show her skills at yesterday's Municipal Middle School Sports Meet. She is the most hopeful female player, but yesterday she was fined for two false starts in the 50-meter race, which was a pity for those who heard about it. Then she hoped to see her skills again in the 100-meter preliminary, but unexpectedly she was fined for two false starts again, which can be said to be extremely unfortunate. According to Chen Bingde, the instructor of Fudan, Wu's false start was actually because she usually practiced without listening to the instructor, so she had today's result. If so, then yesterday's fine is enough to be a lesson for Ms. Wu.</p>
<p>▲ Training for High Hurdles Lacking In the preliminary of the men's group A high hurdles, no one in the four groups had a good performance. The mediocrity of the results is not to be mentioned. Their running posture is not good, and the steps are not accurate, so many hurdles fell, and the results were not good. It is actually because of the lack of training. Among the track races, this sport can be said to be the least interesting.</p>
<p>▲ Kite Flying Suffers Greatly One hundred people participated in the 1500-meter men's A preliminary, which is the highest record in Shanghai's sports meets. Each group of 25 people in each of the four groups only takes three places, which can be said to be difficult. Watching each preliminary, inexperienced players like to fly kites, that is, after the starting gun is fired, they exhaust their life's strength and rush forward to show off and belittle others. However, the process is long and the strength is insufficient. The glory of the moment is difficult to maintain for a long time. Before a lap is over, they are exhausted and fall to Sun Mountain, and even withdraw halfway. It is very appropriate to call it a five-minute fever. They really don't know how to use their strength.</p>
<p>▲ Comparison of Women's 100-Meter Results After Ms. Wu Meixian was fined for a false start in the women's 100-meter A and B groups, no good results appeared. The best one also needs 15 seconds, which is Xiao Jieying of Wuben. In the second group, there were originally five people in the race, and three people were fined for false starts. Only two people competed, and they were completely admitted, taking advantage of the cheapness. The result was 16.6 seconds. This is called taking advantage of the cheapness. Also, there are no good results in the women's physical education school.</p>
<p>▲ 50-Meter Kung Fu Is Not Bad The results of the women's A and B groups in the 50-meter race were not outstanding, but in the women's physical education school group, Chen Wanqing and Sheng Bi of Dongya are not bad at kung fu. The former is 7.4 seconds, and the latter is 7.5 seconds. It is expected that there will be more to see in today's final. Sun Zheng and Ren Song, two ladies from the Southeast, have excellent sprinting at the end. Their posture is wonderful at the finish line, which is very kung fu. It can be said that they have been deeply trained.</p>
<p>▲ Men's 100-Meter Race Has a Fierce Battle In the men's 100-meter race, the talents are quite average. Although the results are not good, the situation is very tight. Liu Jiaxian of Minli, Li Songnian of Daxia, Lin Shihua of Fudan, Dong Yinchu of Guanghua, Cheng Zhonghong of Fudan, and Guan Changfa of Nanfang have similar kung fu. There will be a fierce battle in the final.</p>
<h3 id="e221">Preliminary Results <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>

<p>▲Physical Education School 400-Meter Finals Today: The men's A, B group 400-meter race and the physical education school men's event, originally scheduled to have their finals yesterday, the A and B groups held another round of semifinals yesterday due to the large number of participants. The finals have been rescheduled to today. The physical education school men's finals have also been rescheduled to be held today concurrently.</p>
<p>▲Supplementary Men's A Group 400-Meter Preliminary: The men's 400-meter preliminary was held on Wednesday. Another athlete from Guanghua, Liu Chongli, was omitted from the list at the time, so he had a supplementary race yesterday to test his performance. He ran alone, without taking advantage of the situation, and his time was 57 seconds exactly, which qualified him for the semifinals.</p>
<p>▲Hope That All Judges Will Attend: The judges were very helpful yesterday. Several of the finish line judges did not attend. The conference hopes that they will be present today. In addition, Ms. Zhu Shu and Ms. Zhu Minli Hao have been newly appointed as judges for the group exercises.</p>

<h3 id="e228">A Glimpse of the Venue <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>▲Announcing a Full House: The three stands—east, west, and north—were packed with spectators, with no room to spare. Latecomers had to stand in front of the fences. The effort was naturally unquantifiable. Among the spectators, there were many large groups of male and female students in neat, uniform school uniforms. From a distance, they were quite a sight to behold. There were likely over 20,000 people in the audience.</p>
<p>▲Magnificent Parade: The athletes from each school first made a parade around the track. After the military band came the staff, then the female athletes, followed by the male athletes. Due to the large number of schools and people, the military band had already returned to the front of the podium before the back started moving. The 400-meter track was almost insufficient to accommodate them. During the review, the school flags of each school were lined up, fluttering in the wind. The variety of colors was already quite striking. And the two thousand plus male and female students, following the loud slogans, moved in unison, which was extremely spectacular.</p>
<p>▲Sound Film: The Shanghai office of the American Fox Film Corporation was in charge of filming the event with sound. Among the photography technicians were Chinese photography expert Wang Xiaoting and several Westerners, moving east and west, extremely busy. It is said that the most exciting two to three hundred feet of footage will be selected and sent to New York, and then returned to Shanghai for public release, sometime after March.</p>
<p>▲Order Issues: The order at the venue was generally very good. However, some Boy Scouts lacked experience in maintaining order, leading to outsiders being found in the venue from time to time. The 200-meter finish line lacked a fence, so people leaked in. This was a common occurrence. It is hoped that more capable Boy Scouts can be deployed.</p>
<p>▲Boy Scout Service: Commander Wang Gang, Leng Xueqiao; Deputy Commanders Xie Yanbo, Yu Julu; Dispatch Chief Jiang Yin Seng; Group Commanders and Coaches of various group divisions. The Boy Scouts serving at the venue: Junyi 30, Dongya 50, Guangzhao 50, Tongyi 20, Kaiming 50, Wudao 20, Shangzhong 50, Yousheng 20, Fudan 20, totaling 310.</p>

<p>▲Chengzhong: Wang Huaiqi's group performance is his forte. Every time he appears, he earns praise. Yesterday's performance of Baduanjin and Human Pyramid involved over 300 performers, but the movements were surprisingly well-organized and orderly, which was particularly commendable.</p>
<p>▲Southeast: The Southeast Women's Physical Education School's fitness dance had delicate figures, lively movements, and agile changes. In addition, the costumes were beautiful, which made it even more impressive. It was highly praised by everyone and was rarely seen in the past.</p>
<p>▲Patriotism: The Patriotism Girls' School's middle school department performed marching calisthenics games. The movements were quite neat and the formations changed in an orderly manner, which was quite difficult.</p>
<p>▲National Arts: Participants in the National Arts performance included Yangjing Junior High School and Daxia Affiliated High School. Several elementary school students from Yangjing Junior High School performed individually, with full of vigor and quite proficient in boxing. Dozens of people from Daxia performed together, which was quite</p>

<p>organized.</p>
<p>▲Military Exercises: Military exercises are a trendy activity nowadays. With the national crisis looming, it is a necessity of the times. Three You Junior High School participated in the performance, marching and charging, deeply understanding the essence of it.</p>
<p>▲Huiqun: Huiqun Girls' School performed twice, the first time being group exercises and the second time being a fitness dance. The results were still good, but the number of people was relatively small.</p>
<h3 id="e232">Sideline Stories from the Venue <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>▲Many Temporary Booths Outside the Venue</p>
<p>Around the conference venue, in addition to the mat sheds built by the conference for male and female athletes to rest, there were also many temporary cloth sheds built by various schools. They surrounded the venue, connected to each other. Statistics showed that there were four from Guangzhao Public School, one from Qinghua Middle School, one from Minli Middle School, two from Shanghai Middle School, three from Guanghua Middle School, one from Daxia Affiliated High School, three from Xing Shi Middle School, three from Dongya Sports College, one from Southeast Women's Sports College, one from China Women's Sports College, and one from Kaiming Middle School. The Boy Scouts from Guangzhao Public School and Kaiming Middle School even camped at the venue.</p>
<p>▲Women's Military Review Faster Than Men's</p>
<p>During the general military review of each school, the broadcasting station repeatedly called for the movements to be slower. During the first section of the exercise (slapping hands upward while circling the arms), over four thousand strong arms were seen continuously waving, just like waves churning in the sea. The girls standing in the south moved faster, so it looked like the waves started in the south and fell to the north.</p>

<p>▲Famous Athletes as Spectators</p>
<p>This citywide middle school joint sports meet was of great concern to famous sports figures in Shanghai. Those who came to the venue as spectators on this day included Xiao Dinghua, former Northeast University student who held the national high hurdles record; Dong Jiaxie of Tongji University, who held the East China 1500-meter record; and Sun Huipai, a long jump champion from Shanghai. In addition, many veterans from the Baihong Jiangnan track and field team also came to visit, watching the emerging athletes compete on the field, all eager to give it a try.</p>
<p>▲Two Peddlers Were Dragged Away</p>
<p>Before the 400-meter preliminary for Group B, two peddlers somehow entered the venue, carrying baskets filled with peeled water chestnuts, preparing to make a speculative business deal. Coincidentally, a Western-dressed staff member in the conference saw them, went up, and unceremoniously dragged them out of the sports venue, eliciting different reactions from the spectators.</p>
<p>▲Three Generals Temporarily Become Actors</p>
<p>Ms. Huang Jingzong from Wuben Girls' High School, Ms. Qian Xing Su from Dongya, and Ms. Chen Baixue from Liangjiang, these three generals, in the preliminaries, each won first place. So, a certain Western film company hired them to be on camera and simultaneously captured their delicate voices. Ms. Huang said, "I am very happy today and wanted to run first, and I did run first." Ms. Qian said, "I ran the 50 meters today and came in first. I am very happy and hope to run first next time." Ms. Chen said, "I am very happy to jump first today."</p>
<p>▲The 400 Meters Are Evenly Matched</p>
<p>Wu Yougang, a rising star from Qingxin, has spent several years in school diligently practicing pole vaulting and the 400-meter run. Sure enough, yesterday's result was only five-tenths of a second behind General Guan. He is expected to perform even better in today's 400-meter final. This is expected. Another rising star in middle-distance running, Ji Songen, also had a remarkable result. It is also hoped that he will work harder today to create a new record.</p>
<p>▲Watching One Set After Another</p>
<p>During each school's group exercises, each school showed their specialties, and tens of thousands of people watched with rapt attention, getting carried away, and singing the Jiangbei tune in their mouths ("Watching one set after another, wonderful, wonderful!").</p>

<p>The United Association of Teachers and Staff of Secondary Schools in this city has been greatly outraged to hear that the authorities of the French Concession have illegally forced the Morning Light Girls' Middle School and other schools to suspend classes. They believe that this move hinders our country's educational administrative power. Therefore, they have resolved to send representatives to petition the party and government yesterday. However, because yesterday happened to be the opening day of the city's Middle School Joint Sports Meeting, all the leaders of various agencies attended to participate, so it was temporarily decided to change it to this morning to carry their petition separately to the party and government, requesting serious negotiations with the authorities of the French Concession to achieve the goal of resuming classes.</p>

<p>▲Planning for an Important Meeting in Beijing in the Near Future</p>
<p>▲Quickly Organize the Troops to Go to the Front Lines Together</p>
<p>The United Association of Teachers and Staff of Secondary Schools in Shanghai, in view of the increasing foreign disasters and the increasingly dangerous national situation, sent a special telegram yesterday to the party, government, and military leaders in various places, urging them to unite to resist foreign aggression and save the country. The original telegram is as follows: (Titles omitted) Since September 18, the violent Japanese have displayed their power, occupied our Northeast, disturbed our Shanghai, and recently have been pressing forward step by step, peeking at our Beijing-Tianjin area, attempting to occupy the hinterland. At a time when disasters are deepening, the Communist bandits in Jiangxi are also taking the opportunity to stir up trouble, directly restricting the central army and indirectly helping the violent Japanese. Internal and external troubles are approaching each other. If all of us Chinese people cannot bear to sit and wait for death, we should rise up together to save the country from danger. This association believes that the current way to save the country is to fight against Japan and suppress the bandits at the same time. In order to complete these two great and difficult tasks, it depends on the sages and heroes of the party and the country, the military and political leaders, to be of one heart and one mind, and to unite in sincerity. Unexpectedly, in the past year or so, the party leaders have not shown understanding of the national crisis. A few politicians are even competing for private opinions all day long. Central University is fighting hard on the front lines, while the Southwest has been talking about sending troops, but not a single soldier has been dispatched to the front. Now the situation is urgent. The members of this association, recalling the daily shrinking territory and the imminent demise of the nation, thinking of our isolated army in the front, resisting the fierce bandits with flesh and blood, especially express their views and earnestly hope that the party, government, and military leaders in various places will adhere to the principle of unity in good faith, concentrate their opinions, and go to Beijing in the near future to plan for a major plan to save the country. It is especially hoped that the soldiers in various places will fulfill their duties, quickly organize the troops, and go to the front lines together. Hesitation and observation will bring disaster to the party and the country. Consistency in words and deeds can save this crisis. National survival and national revival depend on this one action. The telegram is urgent. I hope you will consider it. 'Shanghai United Association of Teachers and Staff of Secondary Schools, bowed. (Rest)</p>

<p>Yesterday, Wu Xinglian, the principal of Nanyang High School of Commerce, sent a letter saying, "Dear Sir, Today's newspaper contains an order from the Municipal Education Bureau, stating that because our school induced athletes Fu Jincheng and Zeng Rongzhong from other schools, all the athletes of our school will be revoked. After investigation, our school has absolutely no such thing as inducing students. Fu and Zeng were introduced to the school by Chen Lunge, a standing committee member of the Overseas Chinese Associations United Patriotic Association. In addition to sincerely stating to the Education Bureau, I have transcribed Chen's original letter of introduction: (To Mr. Xinglian, Principal: I am writing to you to introduce Zeng Rongzhong and Fu Jincheng from Penang and Kuala Lumpur. Under the orders of their fathers, they changed to study commerce. I have always known that your school is well-run and particularly concerned about overseas Chinese children. I am sending them here to be introduced. Please allow them to enroll. The fees to be paid should be paid first. 70 yuan each from Nanyang has not yet been remitted. I will temporarily guarantee the rest, and will pay the remaining amount as soon as the payment is remitted. If you approve, please talk to Fu and Zeng.

<p>Chinese and Portuguese experts Li Gongying and Medina met yesterday in the second act of the Shanghai Amateur Class A target shooting final. Each showed their skills and used their unique techniques. All those who were watching were amazed. At that time, after countless waves and unforeseen events, Li Gongying won with 508 to 499, the two-day total was 1500 to 1499, Li Gongying won by one point. Who will be the champion of this competition will have to wait until the last game at 5:30 pm today.</p>
<h3 id="e242">The Question of the "King of Target Shooting" <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>The question of who is the "King of Target Shooting" in Shanghai is a matter that needs to be resolved urgently in today's target shooting world. Will it be Li Gongying? Will it be Medina? Will it be Chinese? Will it be Portuguese? It all depends on the results of the final act today. The performances of the two in the three games over the past two days were extremely exciting and dazzling, and also extremely tense. But regardless of whether they know it or not, it is difficult to make a definitive statement in advance. The two are capable of all kinds of shooting techniques, but each has their own strengths. Li Gongying is good at special techniques, and can always find a way to survive in desperate situations, opening up a path and doing whatever he wants. Medina's accuracy in sending bullets is unparalleled. In general, Li Gongying belongs to the rigid type, while Medina is closer to the flexible type.</p>
<h3 id="e243">Unpredictable Waves <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>Medina took the lead by one point the day before yesterday, and the momentum was quite strong at the start of tomorrow's game. Not long after the guns were handed over, one shot was 48, while Li returned with 56, plus two more scores of 32, exceeding by 26 points. At that time, both sides concentrated their minds, carefully considering each shot, and being cautious. They advanced when they could advance, otherwise they would rather sacrifice than seek carelessly. Both of them have the talent to manage the world, and once they gain momentum, they will be unstoppable. Therefore, the progress of the process contains unpredictable waves. A difference of fifty or sixty points is not surprising and does not matter. In one or two shots, the situation can be reversed. At that time, the two advanced side by side, taking turns being higher and lower. After thirty shots, the situation suddenly changed drastically, and Medina was ahead with 1415 to 1318, with a difference of nearly 100 points.</p>
<h3 id="e244">A Hair's Breadth <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>At that time, the spectators lost color and were very worried for Li. But Li suddenly came up with a huge number of 56, and his face lit up. However, because the bullet delivery was not as stable as Medina's, it was difficult to break out of danger, struggling under fifty or sixty points. Before long, there was a sudden emergency. Medina had 1495, and Li had 1469. At this critical moment, Li cut off the enemy's route forward on the one hand, and created opportunities for himself on the other. Before long, it was 1493 to 1499, and one point would separate the winners and losers. Those who help themselves are helped by heaven. Li finally gained another seven points and reached the goal of 1500 first.</p>

<h3 id="e245">Stupid? <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— Baihe</p>
<p>Not many days ago, all the newspapers in Shanghai published a news item from a certain foreign news agency, roughly saying that at the home of a certain Russian woman in Harbin, while the Russian woman was not at home, not only did thieves steal all her belongings, but they even stole the entire house, leaving not a single tile behind. When the newspapers published this news, they all used the headline "Stupid Thieves".</p>
<p>This kind of unprecedented theft does indeed seem a bit incomprehensible. What things are not worth stealing? Is there really nothing more valuable than these broken tiles and leftover bricks that is worth stealing? But upon closer thought, I feel that the words "stupid thieves" are still not entirely certain.</p>
<p>In the interior, there are petty criminals who "hit with a club" and "carry the mother-in-law", and heroic figures who demand "leave the money to buy the road", specifically targeting the "lone geese" who travel alone, who are easier to deal with. If you kowtow like pounding garlic, you can still keep your head and not worry about food. If you have learned three days of Tai Chi, "one five-jin is very six-jin", and if you don't eat "wonton", you will definitely eat "broad noodles". This kind of behavior, under the pen of a gentle friend, is called "murder and robbery". After "murder and robbery", if you don't do it, you don't stop, and then you come up with "destroying the corpse and eliminating traces" to eliminate the root of the disaster. If stealing things includes stealing houses, then they are "stupid thieves". Then, "destroying the corpse and eliminating traces" should be stupid thieves. Before the "September 18th Incident", all our sovereign rights in the Northeast had already been greatly occupied by Japan. This is just like "a hero encountering a 'lone goose'", "what's yours is mine". The "lone goose" leaves the money to buy the road in the "hero's" pocket himself. But the "hero" doesn't do it once, and he doesn't stop. He not only robs, but also kills. After killing, he also destroys the corpse and eliminates traces, covering the entire Northeast land with interwoven Japanese flags and puppet flags. Although the old man insisted on leaving the Wang land without sovereignty to China, the "hero" was still "deaf as a donkey to the spring breeze", going straight ahead to the end.</p>
<p>What is the difference between stealing things and wanting houses, and seizing sovereignty and wanting land?</p>
<h3 id="e246">The Power of the Masses <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— Sisu</p>
<p>Japanese soldiers are really formidable. No matter how strongly Song Zheyuan and Shang Zhen resist, given a month or so, the counties of eastern Hebei will eventually follow in the footsteps of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe. The people of the country may inevitably be shocked and discouraged, thinking that unless the Japanese soldiers do not attack, they will win if they attack, and China cannot resist them. In fact, that is not entirely true. China also has a sure-win weapon, but it is a pity that the people of the country do not use it! This weapon is boycotting Japanese goods. When the people of the country see the four words "boycott Japanese goods", they inevitably think it is an old cliché, nothing new; but the power of this boycott is really very great!</p>
<p>There was a Japanese-run "Shuntian Times" in Beiping, which can be regarded as the pioneer of cultural aggression. Its circulation was very large, said to be about 100,000 copies. This was not for anything else, but because the newspaper was unscrupulous and could say anything. For example, in the era when Zhang Zuolin was the Grand Marshal and the Northern Expeditionary Army resisted, the newspapers run by the Chinese all avoided talking about defeats and spoke of victories. Grand Marshal Zhang had many taboos, and even Mei Lanfang's performance of "Feng Huan Chao" almost caused a fatal disaster, saying that "Feng" was a homophone for "Fengtian," cursing that he could not stay in Beiping and had to return to his old nest in Fengtian, which could be compared to the prohibition of performing "Da Gu Ma Cao" during Cao Kun's reign. However, the "Shuntian Times" did not buy Grand Marshal Zhang's account, reported the truth, and the people of Beiping knew the truth about the front line, and everyone bought it to read. Grand Marshal Zhang could not do anything about it. Who knew that the Jinan Incident caused a boycott. First, the newspapers run by the Chinese advised people in editorials to boycott the "Shuntian Times" and awaken national consciousness. Everyone's emotions surged, and they stopped buying it. Moreover, Chinese stores could not stop stopping advertising, economic panic occurred, they could not support it, and they announced a suspension of publication. The power of the masses is so great. If all the people of the country insist on not selling or buying Japanese goods, the entire Japanese economy will panic to the point of being unable to support itself, just like the "Shuntian Times", and will naturally collapse. The Chinese have this sure-win weapon, but they put it aside and only expect military victory. Isn't it a pity!</p>

<p>— Zeng Shujuan</p>
<p>During math class, it's everyone's time to secretly read novels; things like "Sexual History", "Flying Catkins", "A Bundle of Love Letters", ... are all good reading materials during this hour. Although it's sneaky and secretive, it's still more lively and interesting than boring math!</p>
<p>The toilet often displays "wall literature" by general unknown writers. If you observe carefully, it's just as numerous as "slogans" when the revolutionary army sets out. Things like "Down with the useless professor!" "Down with the 囗囗 fat man!" are all "good materials" here!</p>
<p>Everyone scrambles to grab the Saturday newspaper; they are not looking at any news, nor are they reading any commentary. What they urgently want to know is: what movie is playing at a certain cinema tonight? And what drama is playing at a certain theater tonight?</p>
<p>A half-length portrait of a Western-suited gentleman and a small scarlet envelope written in red ink are often placed under a female student's pillow. After dinner, people strolling leisurely on the playground, in twos and threes, talking and laughing, are either sworn sisters or fellow villagers with close ties.</p>
<p>The director of student affairs can be said to be the "target of public criticism" for the students. Often, a strange, fashionable young man, once he becomes the director of student affairs, will soon be given a string of "nicknames", even though he never jokes with the students.</p>

<p>— Zhou Jingzhi</p>
<p>The faint sunlight shone through my window curtain from the diagonally crossing trees on the pavement. It was only seven o'clock, and it was a fine Sunday! I was in a gentle village, pursuing a good dream, when suddenly a series of tragic cries woke me from my spring dream.</p>
<p>"Selling children! Boys are eighteen yuan, girls are eight yuan." A man and a woman, resembling a couple, were sitting by the street; the tragic voice came from the haggard woman's mouth.</p>
<p>Ah! The bustling city, the intoxicating city, I can't believe there is such a contradictory fact. Men are eighteen yuan, women are eight yuan, what a cheap price! However, as a student, I really have the feeling of being unable to help! Only staring at their pitiful shadows, and a series of sad voices stirred my soul.</p>
<p>X X X X X</p>
<p>"Selling children! Boys are eighteen yuan, girls are eight yuan."</p>
<p>"························"</p>
<p>From morning to noon, they shouted for several hours. From beginning to end, it was so memorable. I really don't believe that among the wealthy people, there wasn't a single compassionate person, letting them shout, except for a few coolies, expressing sympathy and sighing. This was seen as disappointment in their eyes, irrelevant.</p>
<p>The voice gradually became low and faint. The selling price of eighteen yuan and eight yuan had been reduced to twelve yuan and five yuan, but who would help them with the sad facts? And who would pity their situation and help them?</p>
<p>In the evening twilight, I watched their black shadows disappear faintly, but the sound of "selling children" still hovered in my mind.</p>

<p>Chapter Five: Boiling Tea to Pass the Long Night, Sadly Remembering the Year's End, Inscribing Resistance to Violence, Shouting Loudly</p>
<p>Jiang Shi said: This is outrageous. No matter how civilized a person is, descendants and incense cannot be said to be unnecessary. Otherwise, everyone will not care, and where will the world still have people? Talking about this brought up infinite thoughts in Zhao Weng's mind. He was sober from the wine, and there were no more drunken words. He held an empty teacup in his hand and was just staring blankly. Seeing the pot of hot water placed on the iron stove, it was already boiling. Gurgling, white gas was coming out from the spout and the lid seams. Jiang Shi also saw that it was New Year's Eve, so she shouldn't make the old man sad, so she smiled and said, "Old man, you asked me to make dumplings. Is the dough ready?" Zhao Weng said: "The dough is ready, and the filling is also prepared, just lacking someone to wrap them." Jiang Shi said: "Let's not leave our hands idle while we talk here. My daughter and I can wrap them with you first." Zhao Weng was a restless person. After hearing this, he went to the kitchen himself and brought out a green tile basin of dough and a bowl of filling. So Jiang Shi and her daughter washed their hands and faces, and placed the dough and dumpling filling on a square stool, and wrapped them around the square stool. Zhao Weng took a rolling pin and placed it next to him, holding the dumplings they had wrapped. After a long time, he couldn't help but sigh and said: "Time really flies! I remember when I was little, on New Year's Eve, my mother and my sister were making dumplings, and I was watching by the side, wasn't it just this situation? In the blink of an eye, it has been fifty years." Guizhi said: "As the saying goes, muddling through the days, muddling through the days. No matter what, it's really fast once you muddle through. It takes us a lot of effort to boil a pot of water. Look, we casually put a pot of water on this iron stove, and it boils without us realizing it." These words reminded Zhao Weng, and he smiled and said: "If we don't make tea, the water will boil dry." So he poured three cups of tea and placed them on the table. Before he could distribute them, Guizhi took the pot to add cold water, brought the pot back, and placed it on the stove. First, she offered a cup to Grandpa Zhao, and then offered a cup to her mother. Zhao Weng held the teacup in one hand and stroked his beard in the other, and smiled at Guizhi: "This girl is very quick-witted. If I had one like this by my side, I would be much happier." Jiang Shi smiled and said: "Didn't I say? The old man dotes on her so much. She is a child without a father, so let her kowtow to the old man and become his goddaughter." (55)</p>

<p>— Zhu Qingyun</p>
<p>(One)</p>
<p>The sky was so cold, in the storm of wind and rain, there were also snowflakes; in the gray and dim sky, they shot fiercely like chaotic arrows. The enemy's heavy artillery roared even more, as if it had gone mad, and the large-caliber shells flew one after another in the air. The terrifying explosions, carrying the splashing mud and trees, like water columns rolled up by a hurricane, splashed up one by one, in the fire of the shell explosions.</p>
<p>In the trenches of our army far away, the water was so deep that it had almost soaked the straw mats, making them almost float up. The cold power of the wind and snow, and the bombardment of heavy artillery, made the soldiers in my trenches surrounded by a tragic and dangerous environment. Although the weapons were unfavorable, they had boiling blood and heroic ambition, and they still lay in ambush and waited calmly. Although they watched the terrible shells fall on the trenches from time to time, and splashed the not very strong defensive works and the comrades who were resisting the enemy in the trenches together, they only had grief and indignation, only the heart to avenge, struggling with their flesh and blood bodies and the environment. The sound of artillery was scarce, and the chaotic and heavy footsteps, mixed with the sound of the charge bugles, rolled over in the north wind; that group of yellow-clothed dwarf soldiers, unevenly arranged, lined up in a battle line, like shadowy ghosts in the darkness, charging forward step by step. The enemy was getting closer and closer, and our army had received the order to meet them head-on with a heavy blow. The soldiers' accumulated grief and indignation were vented in a earth-shattering shout. After a burst of sweeping from the rattling machine guns and the booming hand grenades, the front row of dwarf soldiers had fallen like a mountain, but the endless enemies behind were rushing in like a tide; but our bullets were about to run out.</p>
<p>"Forward, fight!" One brother drew out the broadsword on his back, which was as white as snow, slightly tightened his body, and leaped out of the trench. "Good! Forward." Many soldiers drew out their broadswords one by one, jumped out of the trench, and waved the broadswords together, whistling like countless snowballs, rolling straight into the enemy's human tide.</p>
<p>The whistling of the knives, the banging of the guns, and the mournful screams mixed together. This is the struggle of flesh and blood and sharp weapons! 丨丨 The struggle for a faint trace of justice.</p>
<p>(Two)</p>
<p>The stores that have great sales all year round often find slogans such as "Intending to close, recouping the principal", and "Closing down sale, special sacrifice". The beginning of the year is so bad, ordinary stores are struggling to survive in the collapsing economy. The number of unemployed people in society is therefore increasing day by day.</p>
<p>Since the company he worked for was reorganized 丨 that is, sold 丨 he has been unemployed. Although he has asked people for help everywhere and entrusted people to introduce him, he has not been able to find a suitable job for five or six months. Although the expenses of the small family are minimized, in this era of rising living costs, five yuan for rent, about ten yuan for food, and social expenses, no matter how tightly you tighten, an expense of about twenty yuan cannot be reduced any further.</p>
<p>With great difficulty, he entrusted a relative and sent a resume, along with his usual manuscripts and writing style, and received the following reply: "Your matter has been handled by my brother to the best of my ability. Mr. So-and-so, the clerk in our office, has just been absent due to illness. If you are willing to take this position, please come to Shanghai to take up the job immediately. The salary is twenty yuan, without meals. However, in this autumn of overstaffing, there are many who seek such a hard job, so I have to hope that you will come early, lest others take the opportunity to occupy it: : :"</p>
<p>Twenty yuan, excluding meals, how much can you send home in Shanghai, where it is not easy to live? However, if you don't go, you can't even get this little money. If you go, it's still not enough for household expenses, but if you don't go, the great disaster in the future will be even more unthinkable. He thought, sighed, and discussed it with his wife, and decided to leave his hometown and take up this job that was not enough to live on.</p>
<p>The spring breeze was so chilly, and the climate was so cold, but the station was crowded with people struggling for life. He went on a journey, although he knew that the struggle for life was still in an unstable environment, but there was no second path besides moving forward and struggling. The struggle of flesh and blood and sharp weapons, the struggle of life and economy, wrote the epitome of modern China.</p>

<p>Started by Rising Due to Tight Exchange Market</p>
<p>Ended by Falling Due to Adverse Environment</p>
<p>The gold market was mediocre yesterday, with little fluctuation and a hovering trend. In the early morning, London's large contracts for both near and far terms shrunk sharply by one penny nine three seven five, but the ground was not good. The exchange rate was US-UK small five and a half points, and US-UK small five and seven five points.

Speculator Wu also sold, and the trend fell. Later, there was a lot of hovering. After the noon closing, rumors were once said to be unfounded, initially because the exchange market was urgent, because settlement was extremely eager, reaching forty-eight and a half yuan.

However, because Fuchang and Fenjin, Ruixing sold and then bought back, it penetrated outside forty yuan.

Daxingyong delivered contracts from time to time, so it rushed to forty-six and a half yuan. Mitsui filled out seven five for August US dollars, four yuan for May. Hengxing, Fuyu, Daxingyong, and Zhifengyong all had disposals, gradually downstream to forty yuan. The HSBC posted rates revealed British flat and American small one two five.

Mitsui and Citibank came out with three seven five for June. Runchangyu also sold, and fell to thirty-four yuan. Hengyu, Yifengyong, and Zhifengyong slightly bought.

Zhejiang scraped five six two five for August US dollars, and it began to hover. Finally, rumors that my country was banning silver and increasing silver taxes were not true. Sellers cheered up.

<p>According to foreign dispatches yesterday, London's spot and forward prices for silver bullion sharply contracted by one penny nine three seven five. However, after the close, American buying interest revived, with transactions occurring above the listed price of one penny. Sterling depreciated against the dollar by 5.5 points, while the dollar appreciated against sterling by a slight 5.75 points. The initial quotation for near-term sterling was one shilling three pence, quickly followed by one and two-five pence, firmer than the previous close. New York silver prices contracted by seven-five, while forward silver prices dropped by six and a half li. Private telegrams indicated a slight six two five. American cotton prices remained largely unchanged. All these indications suggested a lack of optimism. The initial quotation for near-term U.S. dollar exchange was flat, at $23.75, strengthening slightly after opening but soon tightening again, fluctuating uncertainly. When the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) quoted sterling as flat and the dollar at a slight one two five, the market trended firmer again. After news of the U.S. Senate's passage of the Silver Coinage Act, the market showed slight hesitation, but due to urgent settlement needs, the trend became quite tight. Although Bombay rose by 3.4 annas, it had little impact. Ultimately, the Dalian trading group's attempt to sell was unsuccessful, and the market returned to its original state, resulting in a slight firming. At the close, the selling price for near-term sterling was one shilling zero six two five pence, firmer by one two five compared to the previous close, and the U.S. dollar at $23.875, firmer by one two five compared to the previous close. Banks initially sold and then bought back, generally selling more than they bought. The gold industry did the opposite, buying about 400,000 taels (the Dalian group sold slightly). Flour merchants had settlement needs of over 400,000 taels. The daily transaction record of banks is as follows:</p>

<h3 id="e256">Ningbo Banks Mostly Roll Over Loans <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>According to the assessment of the silver and banking industries, the amount of long-term loans from Ningbo banks to Shanghai reaching maturity this time is no less than 10 million. In prosperous business times, there would be no need to recall these funds, but due to the numerous incidents this year, there are concerns about potential risks, so they have to undertake a partial small-scale closure. Unexpectedly, the matter went against their wishes, and most debtors requested rollovers due to their inability to repay. The Ningbo banks had no choice but to grant these requests. As a result, rollovers reached 8 to 9 million yesterday, and those not yet due will also be rolled over upon maturity. Furthermore, the interest rate has fallen by almost half a yuan compared to the last term (late last year). In addition, long-term deposits and withdrawals yesterday were also no less than 5 to 6 million, with interest rates ranging from 8.5 to 11.5 yuan, a difference of about 3 yuan.</p>
<p>Securities: Securities trading mostly saw declines.</p>
<h3 id="e257">Suspension of May Contracts at Both Exchanges <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange added the June futures contract for auction. Due to sluggish trading, no transactions occurred. Afternoon closing for the May futures contract was also temporarily canceled because brokers were discussing the merger of the two Chinese commodity exchanges and held a general meeting. Trading was therefore relatively light. The market was slightly weak due to the large number of bulls in the market. The situation was still favorable at the morning opening, but prices fluctuated up and down. Among them, demobilization bonds (編遺裁兵) and salt bonds (整六) slightly decreased by 5 fen to 2 jiao, while other varieties slightly increased by 5 fen to 3 jiao 5 fen. The trend had already become chaotic. In the second round, except for demobilization bonds, which slightly increased by 2 or 3 jiao due to the sole demand from No. 1 brokers, the rest uniformly fell back by 1 jiao to 5 jiao due to the heavy settlement by retail investors. At the afternoon opening, Guangdong brokers suddenly went short again, selling demobilization bonds, 19 bonds, and salt taxes in large quantities, further fueling the decline. The market price uniformly fell back slightly, with demobilization bonds falling by 7 jiao 5 fen. However, because the demand for salt tax from northern brokers was very strong, the market price went from low to high, ultimately only falling by 5 fen. In reality, since the closing had already been canceled and today is the settlement stop for the April futures contract, most people were taking a wait-and-see approach, and the trend became uncertain. Overall, the result for the day was a decline of about 1 jiao or more and about half a yuan, but the 20-roll (廿捲) fell the most, by 7 jiao. The total transaction volume was 5,252,000 yuan, including 2,000 yuan in spot goods. Among the futures, salt tax accounted for 2.5 million, demobilization bonds accounted for over 800,000, and the rest ranged from tens of thousands to 300,000 or 400,000.</p>

<p>According to the report of Sin Feng Foreign Firm, on Wednesday (26th), the New York stock market, except for Holmes Stack Gold Mine, which plummeted by 11 yuan, and Auburn Automobile, which fell by 5 yuan, was very flat. Daily fluctuations were only a few corners. Speculators are now mostly waiting for the strong development of the U.S. dollar and currently take a wait-and-see attitude. The total transaction volume for the whole day was 2.91 million shares. According to the report of the Iron Age magazine, the steel workload this week has increased to 25%, which is the highest peak since March 1932. The reason is that all industries have made progress. The Dow Jones Index is listed below:</p>

<h3 id="e259">Sugar Market: Sugar Market Transactions Still Not Active <a href="#e259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>The sugar market has seen a large drop in bidding prices for several days, and the guild's trading floor only has calling prices but no transactions. Yesterday, the price for 24 coarse white sugar was still quoted at 20 yuan 3 jiao, and the price for No. 20 medium white sugar was 20 yuan. Very little was sold. In terms of foreign firms, 1,000 bags of 24 coarse white sugar were sold, with the price at 4.15 Dutch guilders. Yuanji Line exchanged over 1,000 bags of No. 8 and 9 Dutch red sugar, with the price at 16 yuan. Domestic Chaoqing brand goods were sold in a small amount, with the price ranging from 11.4 to 12 yuan. Dozens of bags of Hainan red sugar were offered, with the price at 14 yuan. The after-market outlook is weak, and Jianbing is also unwilling to continue opening. For example, a certain brand of white ice at the top has been affected because a certain firm sent people to buy box skins from the South Goods Store, using inferior goods to repackage and sell. The company is currently investigating and may cause negotiations.</p>

<p>The yarn market is weakening due to the high inventory and sluggish sales. Therefore, people's hearts are softening. Only a few are doing more, tightening and not letting go. The market is still flat, but in terms of the overall trend, if the fruit continues to not rise, the future is still difficult to stabilize.</p>

<p>The cotton bidding market opened in the morning. Because the overseas cotton market was flat and there was a lack of buyers in the market, the market trended downward. Each month fell by 6.8 corners. The afternoon opening was still weak, and each month fell by 7.8 corners. Until the closing time, the Sichuan brokers had a small number of transactions and returned to 3.4 corners. As a result, each month fell by 4, 5, or 8 corners. The total number of transactions for the whole day was 23,150 bales. It was found that Dafeng sold 1,200 bales, Xincheng 1,550 bales, Deji 900 bales, Xiesheng 850 bales, Tongfu 750 bales, and Yichang 600 bales.

<p>The cotton market situation is still weak. Because the overseas cotton market is flat, although there are large households buying to do more, the world trend is not strong, and the yarn and cotton ratio is not good.</p>

<p>Poor Development of Silkworm Eggs in Zhejiang Province</p>
<p>In the nearby silkworm farming areas, farmers are limited by economics this year, and many are hatching local species. In addition, the weather is still cold, and there have been ten days of continuous rain, which is not suitable for the progress of silkworm rearing. Although all rely on fire for heat, development is not favorable. Silkworm eggs have occasional changes. Most of the early batches have been abandoned. Even the late silkworms that have been added still have slow silkworm development due to the sudden sunny and rainy weather. Currently, most of the early silkworms that have reached the third sleep and have enough leaves have stopped eating and are not sleeping, and many are suffering from softening disease. Late silkworms have just reached the second sleep and do not eat leaves vigorously. A bumper harvest is hopeless.</p>
<p>Xiaoshan</p>
<p>This term has been designated by the government as a model area. All categories are leading the rearing of improved species and have instructors to assist in the instructions, and also take over the progress of drying the green, etc. However, the weather is abnormal, and the development of silkworm eggs is quite slow. Early batches in Toupeng, Shanxin An, Shushan, Kan Shan, Wenyan and other places are still only three-sleep vigorous leaves. In Cangqian, Nansha, Xiaosibu and other places, late batches are only two-sleep full leaves. The weather is still cold these days, and most of the silkworms are shrinking and not sleeping. Early silkworms are not eating leaves vigorously. Although the temperature is adjusted with fire, it is still difficult to improve development.</p>

<p>The Su-Zhe silkworm season is affected by the cold weather and continuous rain, which affects the development of silkworm eggs. Silk cocoon merchants in Shanghai are very discouraged about the silk cocoon collection problem. In addition, the financial community's loans are strict, so there is no preparation for departure to collect silk cocoons. In the silk cocoon shops in Jiangsu Province, this time of year was already booked, but this term no one asked. According to people in the silk cocoon industry, the silk cocoon market in Jiangsu Province will inevitably decline invisibly this term. Few silk cocoon shops have been rented out. In Wuxi County, there are 200 silk cocoon shops, except for 78 which have been rented by local silk cocoon merchants to prepare for weighing and collecting cocoons. The rest have no one to host. According to statistics, less than one-tenth of the silk cocoon shops in Jiangsu Province have been rented out this year, and most of them are contracted by each shop to collect and deliver cocoons.</p>

<p>Flour and Wheat are Quiet and Spiritless</p>
<p>Flour margin will be collected at 250 yuan from May 1st</p>
<p>After the flour market opened in the morning, each month felt spiritless. Because the price of foreign wheat, the American wheat dropped by 234 corners, and the Canadian wheat fell by about one corner. However, people inside and outside the industry think that although the foreign wheat has fallen, the outside party still wants to throw it away, and the factories are also difficult to issue files, and there is little movement, so the market in each market is bleak and the price is not much different. Until the afternoon opening, because the delivery of this month is approaching, the customer gangs are still returning one after another, and the factory shorts are also supplementing the trend, so the trend is flat and tired, and the degree of fall is not much. The May and June months are spinning around, and the July and August months are slightly larger. According to the recent situation, although the standard is not strong, the current goods have not stopped, so at the very least, the 2 yuan 4 corners can be maintained. As a result, this month is a small two and a half li, the May and June months are not moving, the July and August months are two and a half li, and the September month is not moving. The flour exchange has announced to the market that the margin for standard flour will be collected at 250 yuan from May 1st.</p>
<p>After the wheat market opened in the morning and afternoon, each month roughly showed a tired spinning market. Because this month has passed, both long and short transactions are automatically straightened out. However, at present, it is speculated that the actual number of deliveries is at most only two or three vehicles, because all are straightened out in advance. Although the foreign wheat prices of the distant months are also small, the traders are willing to issue files, so the trend is stable. As for the inland gang, because there is no grasp of the new wheat in the country this year, the remote sale has also stopped, not enthusiastic. As a result, there are no changes in each month.</p>

The Shantou gang sold one car of Tancheng soybeans, with a price of 5 yuan 08 fen. More than 600 packs of general Doudou were sold in the city, which were divided by the Guangzhou gangs in this street. 200 packs of Shahuang were sold for 5 yuan 4 jiao half, and were also purchased by the Guangzhou gang. Greedbeans are quite stable. Its large vegetable greedbeans are very rare and beautiful. The red grain Jiangbei gang is still interested. Yesterday, one car of red husk was purchased, with the price the same as the previous day.

<h3 id="e273">Voluntary National Salvation <a href="#e273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>— Tianfang</p>
<p>National salvation, it is said, is not a term that makes people turn up their noses and walk away. On the contrary, it is quite fashionable, such as "dancing for national salvation," "entertainment for national salvation," and "beauty for national salvation." Roughly speaking, the fact that the nation needs to be saved today is beyond doubt, but for us, who "establish the nation with writing," we are quite particular about "rites." Therefore, there is no room for discussion regarding the choice of words. This is because "if the name is not correct, then the words will not be smooth."</p>
<p>Recently, it was reported that a "Voluntary National Salvation Association" has been established in Guangdong Province. As the name suggests, it is known that it comes from the people and is not forced by the government. National salvation must come from "voluntary," which has the idea of "driving" oneself. Is it also out of necessity? However, it is dangerous!</p>
<p>Since the "September 18th Incident" when Japanese artillery fire bombarded China, the sound of "national salvation" has been overflowing in the country. But to whom does this responsibility ultimately belong? Is it the "political power" or the "administrative power"? Because there is no clear regulation, it is still not very clear. Some say that this is the responsibility of the people, but after the transformation from "long-term resistance" to "absolutely not speaking of resisting Japan," it seems to be a matter for a few people in high positions, and the common people have nothing to worry about. In short, there is no constitutional provision, as long as you do not "endanger the Republic of China," you can be considered a good citizen. Whether to save or not to save is quite free.</p>
<p>Perhaps saving without saving can save the safety of one's life and property. In this year when one cannot move, it is better to eat quietly and be more generous. It is also possible to regard artillery fire as fireworks or sound movies. After dinner, it is good to open the newspaper and read the good news. You do not need to ask where this good news comes from. Whether it is "resistance against Japan" or "suppression of bandits," you do not need to care about which country the people who are "temporarily headed" or "captured" belong to. In short, all good news is good. Now we have wise ministers internally and good generals externally, so we are not afraid of not being able to save the mere China. All of us common people, although it is said that there are "internal troubles and external threats," in reality, "we are not afraid." Therefore, in terms of reason, "national salvation" is "absolutely impossible." In terms of power, it is also unnecessary, so you can rest easy. If you think it is absolutely necessary, or you are afraid of being suspected of falling behind, then choose what you are close to, such as "dancing" and "smoking," and "go together, go together" is also possible. Just remember to follow in other people's footsteps and never act rashly. This is not your right. Otherwise, moving and making a conclusion contrary to the topic is not something to be happy about, but a little bit sad.</p>

<p>— Yun</p>
<p>A few days ago, the Huang Mansion was really busy, and it is said that the wedding ceremony of the second young master is coming soon. His mother had carefully considered how to make the "new room" beautiful last winter, and it took a lot of effort to arrange it until now, so the second young master's new room is also decorated luxuriously.</p>
<p>Because Mrs. Huang's idea of hugging her grandson was too strong, she wrinkled her face with many lines, and from time to time, she showed a lot of smiles, happily discussing with her son, buying this and doing that. Sometimes it seems that she doesn't trust people, so she personally drives her own car to buy and buy. In this early spring season, the elderly are prone to illness. Mrs. Huang, who had worked a little, actually fell ill. And she was unconscious, obviously very dangerous. The maids began to take turns serving the wife day and night. According to the doctor, it was "old illness" and there was no great danger, so the second young master was relieved. But on the other hand, the sister-in-law and his elder brother regarded the mother's illness as irrelevant, of course, they didn't talk about it, or what.</p>
<h3 id="e276">Do Not Reason <a href="#e276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>What worries. Not only that, but they even stared at her dying, because her death would bring them tremendous benefits.</p>
<p>Ever since Mrs. Huang fell ill, half a month had passed, but her condition showed no improvement. The fortune teller said that the happy event of the second young master should be held earlier on an auspicious day to "counteract the ill luck," so that her illness would see the unexpected effect of resurrection from the dead without medicine.</p>
<p>The night was deep, and it was frighteningly quiet here, as if death</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>

<p>"Mom, do you feel a little more comfortable?" The second young master comforted her in a soft voice.</p>
<p>"...Pain, heartache..." She sobbed.</p>
<p>"Your illness will get better, please be relieved, and sleep well!"</p>
<p>"Alas! Why don't they want to come and see me? After raising them, they don't understand filial piety. No wonder the world is going to turn upside down, and it's not like a good world! Life is uninteresting, it's better to die straightforwardly!"</p>
<p>"Mom, don't be angry anymore, won't you get sicker if you are like this? Don't worry, after the young daughter-in-law comes, she will definitely be filial to you."</p>
<p>As he spoke, he ordered the little maid A Cui to serve the lady.</p>

<p>Editor:</p>
<p>My wife's younger sister is twenty years old this year; at the age of sixteen, she was betrothed to a farmer's son of the same age in the same village through a matchmaker, but there was no evidence. The person my wife's younger sister was betrothed to is a rogue without a job; his father is addicted to opium, and the fields and houses have all been sold. My mother-in-law and others, seeing this situation, knew that after she married, there would be no means of survival. The mother and daughter cried and came to me, asking me to rescue her from this sea of ​​misery. Seeing how pitiful they were, I had no choice but to find a way for her.</p>
<p>Sir, my home is in the countryside of Taicang, and my wife's younger sister</p>
<p>The father of the other party is very strong and unreasonable: when he heard the news, he threatened to use harsh means to kidnap the bride. I think it's not good to stay in the countryside after all, and I want to take her to Shanghai to find a job and find another partner. I will ignore the old partner.</p>
<p>Sir, can that old partner sue me for elopement? I respectfully ask you to choose a way out for me, and I will be very grateful. Wishing you</p>
<p>A bright future Hu Naiwu respectfully</p>
<p>X X X X</p>
<p>Editor's note: In various parts of our country, the procedures for engagement are mostly based on the testimony of the introducer, and there is no substantial</p>
<p>Physical evidence. Even in some places, a procedure of exchanging birth certificates is carried out, but because these birth certificates are not signed and sealed, they cannot be regarded as physical evidence. This custom is recognized in court; therefore, the fact that Mr. Hu's wife's younger sister is betrothed does not become ineffective because there is no evidence. Considering that she was only sixteen years old when she got engaged, she was still a minor, and of course her parents acted as agents, so this marriage contract is legally valid, but now that she is an adult, if she herself is unwilling, she can request to be dissolved. The procedure for dissolution is of course best done by agreement; in the event that both parties hold different views, then you only have to request the court to declare it, and the result is nothing more than spending some money; as long as Mr. Hu's wife's younger sister insists that she is unwilling, the court cannot force her. Ignoring it cannot be done.</p>
<p>Speaking of bride kidnapping, there is basically nothing to fear. Engagement is just a kind of contract, and among all kinds of contracts, its effectiveness is the smallest. Why? Because the Civil Code stipulates that no matter what, a marriage contract cannot be forcibly performed. The status of husband and wife begins only after marriage; after engagement and before marriage, the woman is still a member of her parents' family. If the fiancé seduces the fiancée, unless her parents do not pursue it, it will constitute a crime of adultery! Bride kidnapping! That's even more terrible The crime of rape cannot be escaped! But in Chinese society! Virginity is still valued, so after every bride kidnapping,</p>
<p>They will make the best of it, endure it, and not pursue it.</p>
<p>You now want to take your wife's younger sister to Shanghai to make a living, which is correct. They cannot file a lawsuit for elopement. Because your wife's younger sister is still a member of your mother-in-law's family, they are not qualified to report this crime of elopement that harms the family. However, if you want to find another marriage partner for her, then it is best to do so after her first marriage contract is declared dissolved.</p>

<h3 id="e278">Time in a Dream "Continued 39" <a href="#e278" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c278" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">278</a></h3>
<p>— Abandoned Lean Gull</p>
<p>Although the image given to him by the National University Professors' Association for National Salvation was extremely bad, he was not completely discouraged. After feeling sad at home for a few days, he was eager to try again and wanted to find another national salvation organization to participate in. Give some strength to his motherland.</p>
<p>"Ah! This person is a good son of the Republic of China! The support association he presides over will no longer be superficial. Go and see him!" One afternoon, Wu Yi accidentally read an amazing news item in the newspaper and couldn't help but get excited again. The gist of this news is as follows:</p>
<p>The escape process of Xu Songqiao, a member of the Standing Committee of the Righteous Army Support Association</p>
<p>"::: Mr. Xu Songqiao, a member of the Standing Committee of the Association, has always been determined to resist Japan and has spared no effort in managing the Association's affairs. He was envied by a certain country's people: on a certain day of this month, behind the Central Hotel in Zhuangyuan Lane, he was suddenly kidnapped and taken into a car, which sped away. ::: For a week, there was no news, and relatives and friends suspected it was a case of helping to kidnap and extort ransom. They were in the process of ::: Unexpectedly, Mr. Xu suddenly escaped and returned at about three o'clock last night. According to him: ::: The guards were all from a certain country, and they were only given a basin of white rice and two or three dried radishes a day: ::: Various abuses, covered in wounds. ::: Last night, taking advantage of the guards' sleep, he escaped through the wall and ran wildly for forty or fifty miles on foot, his feet were calloused, and he was barely breathing. ::: He has now returned to his residence to recuperate and has decided to continue his work of resisting Japan and saving the country after he fully recovers. ::: If it is Mr. Xu, he is a true patriotic man of this world! :::"</p>
<p>Although Wu Yi had never met Xu Songqiao before and didn't know what kind of person he was, he couldn't help but feel respect after reading this passage. He deeply regretted that he hadn't read the newspaper earlier. He hurriedly inquired about the address of the Capital Righteous Army Support Association and hurried there: unexpectedly, when he looked at the place, there was a sign, and there was also a sign of a communication agency hanging on the side, but the house was already covered with the seal of the Capital Police Department, and the Iron General was guarding the door, which surprised him greatly.</p>
<p>"Ah! Principal Wu?" Just as Wu Yi was wandering around in a daze, a patrolling officer happened to pass by. 丨This patrolling officer used to be a school policeman at X University, so he recognized him. When he saw him, he came over to greet him.</p>
<p>"Oh! You are Li Jinbiao, Mr. Li?" When Wu Yi saw that it was an old friend, he hurriedly told him about the strange thing that was happening.</p>
<p>But they are too radical, right? It's really unreasonable!"</p>
<p>Without asking right from wrong, Wu Yi spoke with a tone of blaming the Police Department for suppressing the patriotic movement.</p>
<p>"Haha! Too radical? No, no, you're all wrong! Principal Wu." Patrol Officer Li said with a very humorous smile, "They are slippery! They are liars! The Xu something Qiao who was reported in the newspaper today has been arrested by our department! Fabricating rumors and defrauding money: ::: According to the charges, he will have to spend at least three years in prison!"</p>
<p>Li Jinbiao's words made Wu Yi even more confused.</p>
<p>"How about we go somewhere to drink tea and talk in detail?" Wu Yi requested this.</p>
<p>"I don't dare! It is Principal Suo who is treating me, so I should accompany you." As Li Jin said, he put on the air of a subordinate seeing a superior, and let Wu Yi walk in front, while he walked with his hands hanging down, one step away.</p>

<h3 id="e279">Spring Sunshine of Palm Springs <a href="#e279" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c279" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">279</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Fen</p>
<p>A Paradise in the Soft Red Dust</p>
<p>Hollywood belongs to California and has a mild climate. After the severe winter gradually disappears, lovely spring follows. The snow on the mountain peaks melts, the green buds on the branches appear, and the warm spring breeze envelops the earth. This is the most vibrant time of the year in Hollywood. The stars are full of energy and work with courage.</p>
<p>A few miles away from the bustling area of ​​Hollywood, high mountains are connected to each other, and there is a sandy land in the mountains. On the mountainside, there is a famous spring in the United States called Palm Spring. There are very few people in winter, but when spring comes, many Hollywood figures come to Palm Spring to stroll and relax after working hard. The top of the mountain and the foot of the mountain are their world. Several famous big stars have built villas, and the entire spring is spent between the mountains and clear waters.</p>
<p>The big-nosed Jamie Duran, who usually pays the most attention to time economy, also holds a cigar in his hand and wears a soft hat in this lovely spring, spending a few days of uneconomical time by the Palm Spring.</p>
<p>Charles Leighton, after finishing "The Courtesan," felt that Hollywood was too noisy and tasteless. He was originally British, so he really wanted to go back to England. One day his friend dragged him to Palm Springs for a spring outing, and Leighton was there, and he almost thought he was no longer in Hollywood. He couldn't believe that there was such a quiet place next to such a turbid world as Hollywood. So he lived there and never mentioned going back to the country again.</p>
<p>Joan Crawford likes to travel alone. She drives her car to Palm Springs and lives in her villa. She wanders on the top of the mountain every day and sits on the rocks in the middle of the mountain. When it comes to dusk, she is still reluctant to leave. She said to people, "Surrounded by such scenery, any troubles in life can be put aside. Take a breath of fresh air. How can you be willing to enjoy such a peaceful blessing for a few days in a lifetime?"</p>
<p>Jane Gaynor doesn't care about the season. Whenever she has time from work, she immediately goes to Palm Springs to live. On average, she spends more time living in Palm Springs than in her home on Peeverly Hill. Kerr Farel is also a regular at Palm Springs, but he has now left the film industry and may become a rare visitor.</p>
<p>Although Palm Springs has a long history, its reputation is still due to Hollywood. In fact, the scenery near Palm Springs is not inferior to Yellowstone National Park, but everything is natural and there is no artificial mixing. Except for the El Mirador Hotel at the foot of the mountain, there are no tall buildings. Hollywood figures who are tired of living in red buildings and giant mansions naturally have infinite feelings about it.</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3 id="e280">Review of "Red Dust" and Dog Show <a href="#e280" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c280" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">280</a></h3>
<p>— Si Ping</p>
<p>"Red Dust," which opened at Cathay yesterday, has a Chi Hen Ha Green jumping out of the darkness, but it is not as hot as before, and the wild woman is not as fierce as before. There is also a Clark Gable who never makes people happy; however, she must pretend to be a rough man, so she can't make "gentleness like water," and she can't make "passionate love like fire." It's just empty talk, the purpose is to touch the audience's subconscious. The entire plot is to move a love triangle from a familiar city to the tropical Annam, which can save a lot of scenery that needs to be capitalized. The lighting is a little worse, and the audience can be forgiven. And the unexpected benefit is that you can borrow a gust of red dust that often occurs in the tropics. Before the audience can recognize what is going on, the scene changes and the screen is calm again. A few more rain scenes make the film change from beginning to end, but during the heavy rain, a white patch is exposed in the middle of the two large dark clouds in the sky. No matter how tight the wind is blowing or how heavy the rain is, it always stays there without moving.</p>
<p>In the past, most of the so-called erotic and sensual films were women undressing for men to watch. In this film, it is men undressing and hinting for women to watch. This may be the highlight of the so-called "hot and wild women, happy to be violent men," right? Speaking of "violence," some places are too rough. This rough man squatted high on the tree and shot a tiger to death. Later, he gave her a pistol because of a love affair, but it seemed like a small matter like stabbing a knife. He pressed his waist and leaned slightly to the side, but did not fall to the ground. He was still able to sit on the chair and order another so-called hot and wild woman to treat this rough man. He didn't die, so his roughness was more powerful than a tiger; if he had unfortunately died of his injuries, this film would not be able to continue, and the so-called hot and wild woman would not be happy to see the rough man, and this love triangle story would not be able to reach a happy ending.</p>
<p>The witty remarks in "Red Dust" can embellish the entire film. Before "Red Dust" was released, there was also a short dog-made movie, which was really a dog show! However, those many dogs were dressed in a decent manner, and instead of running on all fours, they walked on two legs like humans. When the dogs opened their mouths, they were matched with human language; the audience could see the dogs' mouths opening and closing, and at the same time they could hear the words, dog mouths and human words, what a strange thing! This is really a ridiculous act that is sliding the world. Or this can also be said to be the omnipotence of science! In short, in general, the dog show is full of ugly things, making people wonder what it is saying. If it is said that in the past, Rin Tin Tin, a dog, even became a dog star, now gathering a group of dogs in one film can satisfy the audience's curiosity, then this kind of curiosity is really unacceptable.</p>
<h3 id="e281">Ancient Country Beauty The Mummy <a href="#e281" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c281" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">281</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Nan</p>
<p>The ancient country beauty Mummy, which was re-screened at Carlton the day before yesterday, is a supernatural film. The stories of supernatural films are always bizarre, so I will record them in more detail below.</p>
<p>In 1922, British archaeologists in Egypt found a mummy, but because they were careless, they opened an ancient incantation, so the mummy was resurrected and took the curse away. In 1932, other archaeologists planned to make some discoveries. At that time, the mummy ran to the garrison and pointed out the tomb of a certain Egyptian princess 3,700 years ago, which was indeed excavated and displayed in the British Museum in Egypt. The mummy recited a curse to the corpse and knew that the princess had been reincarnated in this world as an Egyptian noblewoman. The mummy tried its best to seize her for itself and told a love story that had not been completed 3,700 years ago.</p>
<p>, planning to die with her to seek spiritual union. However, there was a young archaeologist whose father died at the hands of the mummy, and he also deeply loved the girl, so he secretly became enemies with the mummy, but the mummy was so powerful that it could know the past and the future, and could control people from thousands of miles away. Although the archaeologist went to the mummy's house and witnessed the mummy trying to kill the girl, he could not help. In a critical moment, the idol enshrined in the mummy's house suddenly emitted golden light, which not only boosted the archaeologist's spirit and made him unafraid of magic, but also turned the mummy into a rotting corpse, and its body was shattered into pieces, so the girl was unharmed. The screenwriter's purpose is to be extremely mysterious, to make the audience feel terror and tension, so it is completely detached from reality and becomes an absurd fantasy. Reason is of course out of the question, but the ending with evil not invading good is very clever and commendable.</p>
<p>Structurally, the entire film is very compact, consistent from beginning to end, and the terrifying places come one after another. Not only are "Desert Island Monster" and "Terror Grotto" far inferior to this film, but even the supernatural masterpiece "Frankenstein" is inferior to it. The artistic success is above all horror films.</p>
<p>The director is also not bad. With a good plot and actors, although the director does not spend much effort, his ability is not weak during the performance. Some trivial small shots and secret writings are very vivid. Many scenes that seem to be finished but not finished not only do not feel disconnected, but also have lingering charm to be found. The photography is also very beautiful. is a capable hand. The scenery has the ancient Egyptian style. The lighting and sound are also on par with the photography: : : In short, there are no loopholes to be found in terms of technology.</p>
<p>Finally, I will talk about the vivid actors in this film: 克洛夫 Boris Karloff is famous for his supernatural films. His slow movements are very suitable for the identity of the mummy. The meticulous makeup is also something that others cannot imitate. Last time, his performance as a zombie was banned because it was too bizarre, which was generally regretted. This time, he is still such a supernatural character, and we can actually see it, which is really the fate of the film, and it is fortunate and unfortunate! The girl is played by 琪塔裘汉 Zita Johann, who has the typical Egyptian beauty of the past, and the performance is also top-notch. In addition, there is an archaeologist who is frightened and goes crazy because the mummy is resurrected, and laughs wildly because he is crazy, which is extremely profound. The other supporting roles are much worse.</p>
<p>In short, its beauty is indescribable, especially the scene where the mummy tells the old story of three thousand years ago, which is fascinating. So this film can be said to be satisfactory to anyone!</p>
<h3 id="e282">Raw Materials for Making Up Mummies <a href="#e282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Fen</p>
<p>Universal Company's latest blockbuster "Ancient Country Beauty"</p>
<p>The Mummy (original translation: Mummy) is a great historical film. The story in it is about the ancient Egyptian celebrities who died and were smeared with spices to make them permanently incorruptible, as well as various stories about mummies that have been passed down in history. The protagonist who plays the mummy is 保里斯卡洛夫, the monster in "Frankenstein". In this "Ancient Country Beauty", he uses various makeup techniques to transform himself into a thin and small mummy with a pigeon-shaped face, making his body shrink. This is a very difficult thing.</p>
<p>The mummy played by 保里斯卡洛夫 is said to be 3,700 years old. When 保里斯 is making up, he wets his face with water, then applies a very thin layer of cotton on his face, then applies collodion "fake ivory solution" and a layer of alcohol resin to make the collodion shrink. After the body is tightly tied with bandages, resin is applied, and the hands and feet are tightly tied with rubber paste bandages. After the chest is tightly tied, it is extremely difficult to breathe, but 保里斯 can endure the work, each time for up to five hours. In the last scene, 保里斯 extended it to eight hours. 保里斯 is one of the only people after the thousand-faced man 郎 却奈 died. Although Hollywood is big, there is no second person who is willing to sacrifice his life for art.</p>
<h3 id="e283">Tom Mix's Past <a href="#e283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>— Dong Lin</p>
<p>Participated in the Eight-Power Allied Forces</p>
<p>Not long ago, someone in this publication wrote an article to lament the retirement of Tom Mix. This kind of thing is completely unnecessary. I wonder if Mr. has heard about Tom Mix's life?</p>
<p>Before Tom Mix entered the screen, he was a junior officer in the American army. When the Eight-Power Allied Forces attacked Beijing in 1899, he also participated in this battle; at that time, it was said that he had killed countless Chinese people. After the war ended, he was discharged from the army due to serious injuries. Although the Boxer Rebellion was a disaster brewed by the Qing Dynasty itself, the people who killed our compatriots are always our enemies. Then what are we still lamenting for Tom's retirement?</p>
<p>Editor's note: Although Mr. Donglin's opinion comes from patriotic feelings, there are also errors. In times of war, it is useless and harmful to pursue former grudges or resent a certain individual who participated in the war without being able to kill the enemy and achieve results, because in this case, wouldn't everyone in the world be our enemy?</p>

<p>— Ne</p>
<p>Kee Yin was now extremely heartbroken, she couldn't imagine how Ellen, such a loyal servant, could treat her former mistress with such disrespect. So she said, "Yes, this world has changed too strangely. Ellen, you've changed too, your heart is no longer what it used to be. Ellen, farewell." Ellen, hearing this, became uncontrollably furious, she said: "Why are you still putting on airs and trying to drive me away?"</p>
<p>Just as they were arguing more and more fiercely, a maid brought in a telegram. Kee Yin took the telegram, opened it, and read it. She said to Ellen: "You don't need to worry about Fannie Joey anymore. He won't be coming back either. He's dead!"</p>
<p>Ellen quickly stepped forward and supported Kee Yin. Kee Yin fainted and fell into Ellen's arms, the telegram falling to the ground. Ellen shouted: "Madam! My Madam!" Only then did Ellen recover her true nature, and she was once again a loyal servant to her mistress.</p>
<p>After the armistice, London inevitably had celebrations. Kee Yin wandered alone in the streets, trying to find her son Joey among the crowd to guide him home. In the midst of the honking horns and clanging bells of celebration, crowds sang and danced in the streets, and sometimes she was grabbed by ignorant celebrants and pulled into the dancing. She listlessly returned home, having not found her son, with many red, green and colorful paper strips wrapped around her hat and throat. She vaguely recalled that there had been a similar celebration many years ago, probably when Mafeking in South Africa was relieved!</p>
<p>The war was over, and everything had changed, unbelievably changed! The tide of sin rose day by day; the people wanted to forget the pain of the war and engaged in indulgence and extravagance; thus there were nightclubs, male dance partners, robbers, kidnappers, etc., and even children playing in the streets were sprayed with machine guns! These were even more terrible than war. And there were the divorce cases that were reported in the newspapers every day. Peace was getting further and further away! Countries continued to argue incessantly; the League of Nations was like an empty dream; unemployment, hunger, and riots filled the British Isles.</p>
<p>Thus it was the end of another year. Robert raised his glass towards Kee Yin and said: "Another year has passed!" Kee Yin couldn't help but shudder. She said: "Another year is before us!" The distant bells rang again; the streets were filled with boisterous people, singing the tune of Auld Lang Syne, a tune that broke Kee Yin's heart. She stood beside her husband and said: "All the glory and victory have become things of the past; all the sorrow and bitterness have become like the joys and sorrows in a dream. Let us now drink a glass of wine, firstly to commemorate our two sons who sacrificed themselves for the country; and secondly to commemorate the fact that our own hearts have died with them!" As they drank, they saw groups of figures, like fleeting clouds, dazzling before their eyes; these past figures were all part of their lives 丨 Bridges and Ellen raised their glasses to celebrate the arrival of the new century; the children stood beside them in their pajamas, with astonished eyes; Edith and Edward looked at each other and smiled, their love endless; Joey's childishness would never grow up; Margaret's spirit of courage and progress; Fannie, the only flower in London, but her heart would always have Joey 丨丨 Robert and Kee Yin still looked at each other and smiled, still with hope, heading forward until the end of the world. "The End"</p>
