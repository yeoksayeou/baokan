<p>日本新外相廣田弘毅於十四日就職。自表面言之。内田焦土外交碰壁以後易以新人。日本對華外交。似不免略須有所變更。惟一按其實際。日本政局全爲荒木等軍人所把持。荒木等旣以强佔我東北扶植其所製造之傀儡僞國爲根本政策。則無論外相改任何人。總不能使中日闗係。有若何之轉變。此一般人所易瞭解之形勢也。</p>
<p>數日以來。日本通訊社不斷的播傳闗於廣田外交新方針之消息。吾人就</p>
<p>其與中國有闗者綜核研究之。其假借尊重（滿洲國）之獨立。以圖繼續侵佔我東北。猶内田也其欲使中國放棄東北。爲投降式之對日親善。猶内田也。所不同者。内田揭　靜觀主義。廣田則聲言採取積極政策耳。然内田靜觀主義之要點。爲靜待中國之自然發展。不加勉强廣田之積極政策。則（欲使中國爲本身利害與幸福。自動改變現在之對日態度。）其圖以（請君入甕）之手段。對待中國。則又無所殊異也吾人對於廣田之認識。其重要之資料。爲（一）廣田早年。對於當時日本受三國干涉而還我遼東。曾憤慨於由軍人血戰得來之土地。因軟弱外交復致喪失。（二）從前日本對中國提出之二十一條要求。廣田亦曾私擬一種草案。欲以陰謀侵害我黄河流域主權綜此二者廣田之必與荒木輩相表裹。發揮日本軍人外交之能事又顯然可見矣</p>
<p>據日本方面所宣傳。廣田對華。與歷任外相不同。將爲從來未見之更生的外交。吾人在今日以前。殊未見中日外交。在日本軍人外交未變之時。有可以</p>
<p>更生之點。然日本自退出國聯後。苦於孤立久矣。或者廣田欲别求途轍。以冀更生乎。其途轍之爲吾人所能推測而知者。大概利用所謂今日世界政治經濟的相互闗係。變易對付英法之態度。直接以减少列强妨碍日本對華壓迫之勢力。間接以使中國不得不受其誘惑。使廣田更生的外交而果如此也。則日本完成更生的外交之日。即中國沉淪於萬刦不復的境地之時矣。</p>

<p>臺報告、颶風於前日下午、吹抵浙海岸、向北北西進行、有在温州灣登岸、繞陸襲滬背之勢、但入晚轉變方向、於九時許抵寗波東部海面、向北北東前進、至昨日清晨二時半、過吳淞口外之大戢山、距滬僅六七十英哩、在上次颶風所經過之花烏山西、本埠昨晨雖未爲颶風之中心所襲、但亦爲其邊緣所波及、</p>
<p>向朝鮮進　天文臺於昨日上午十時、發出之第一次報告、朝鮮與日本海氣壓增高、颶風梭巡東海、於昨晨二時三十分、過上海東部、（即大戢山）向北北東、於昨晨六時至北緯三十二度東經百二十三度、（距上海東北約九十英里）洋面、有驚人之大風、待至下午二時、行抵北緯三十三度東經百二十四度向北北東前進、按該處距上海之東北約百五十英里、更向東北傾斜、向朝鮮半島西南角進行、因之朝鮮西南部海岸、滿布風雲、朝鮮海峽海潮將增漲、至浙江海岸一帶、風勢巳減、</p>

<p>淞口翻船　至吳淞鎭後、該處沿浦之外馬路堤岸、盡被潮水剥蝕、泥土外陷、是處並倒有電桿一根、當昨晨一時後、鎭上街道、亦遭潮上激、滿街積水、颶風過時、瀕浦房屋摇撼、瓦片横飛、電話電燈至九時後、即因電桿吹折、相繼斷絶熄滅、成爲黑暗世界、江面船隻、受風潮激盪而傾覆者、有裝運猪船一、海蜇船一、損失尙無從調查、船上之人、幸蒙搭救、未肇生命危險</p>

<p>土地堂街、前晚十點三十分褚福慶家屋頂　因受風雨打擊、突然坍下、倒於比鄰五號麵業公所内東廂房之屋頂上、頃刻坍下、致將睡於該屋内寡婦謝湯氏幼子謝銀才、及同居之糜金妹·高瑞良·一併壓傷、旋經該管一區二所派長警馳往救出、車送上海醫院醫治、糜金妹傷及頭部及腰部、傷勢最重、謝銀才及高瑞良之頭部、均受微傷、留院療養、又南市小南門外桑園街五七弄二十九號、陸寶生房屋、後樓突然坍下、幸樓上樓下無人在彼、未被壓傷、九時許大東門内巡道街四十九號醫生胡鴻舫家灶披間旁之短牆一座、倒於後面談家弄内、幸未傷人、而民國路上公用局之廣告牌、爲大風吹倒者、有十餘方之多、</p>

<h3 id="c164">搭架子 <a href="#c164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>— 丙丁</p>
<p>中國人最擅長（搭架子）的藝術，雖然外國的大建築師，也是佩服到五體投地。試看上海建築高大的洋房，不是先（搭架子）嗎？譬如目下靜安寺路正在建築的二十二層四行準備庫，外面很高很高的竹架子，密密層層地搭着，它的藝術，不是很高明嗎？還有慶弔的人家，新店的開幕，也要搭許多架子，裝裝場面，在搭架子的一班勞工瞧來，眞是輕鬆的工作。只要幾根竹，一把篾，不到半天工夫，便搭成一座道貌岸然，架子十足的綵棚了。</p>
<p>搭架子的藝術，說起來令人咋舌。幾位蠻脚蠻手的藍土布勞工，把幾根竹，横七竪八的架了起來，把一條篾結了；一層層搭上去，頃刻便成功了架子，做了金碧輝煌，美輪美奂的基本工作。或者花綵絢爛，華燈熣燦，裝點得如火如荼；其實，不過竹架子搭成吧了。</p>
<p>一個人也是如此，要想裝點場面，拾高身價，必須從（搭架子　着手。不爲搭架子）的朋友，在目下社會裹，一定要落伍的。遭人奚落，受人白眼，被鬼挪揄，這是（不搭架子）的結果。架子之於建築房屋，闗係極大；架子之於（處世藝術），也是非同小可。</p>
<p>做官要搭官架子，做行長經理，要搭行長經理的架子，故資本家要搭資本家的架子；甚至於做公館裹的僕役，學校中的敎員，洋行裹的買辦，妓院裹的老鴇妓女，都各有各的架子，纔顯得自己的身價。可是（搭架子）的功妙，神而明之，難以言傳。可搭的地方，不可不搭；不可搭的地方，也要快拆爲妙，方纔可算是（搭架子）的藝術。譬如官僚見了小百姓，儘管（搭架子；要是碰了上司，或太太，姨太太，這個松香架子，便要拆掉。經理行長見了夥計，儘管（搭架子，要是見了老　股東，這個豆腐架子，便要拆了。能搭能拆，方是（搭架子）的專家。</p>
<p>脚碰脚的朋友，因爲得着（吹）（拍）的（處世藝術，）交了紅運，抖了起來，當然要搭起架子，來顯自己的威風。我以爲到處能挺胸突肚來搭架子，也不失爲大丈夫本色；唯有忽搭忽拆的（臭架子）專家，未免令人齒冷，難道大丈夫應該有這（能屈能伸）的本領嗎？但，搭架子畢竟是大丈夫得意之事！</p>

<p>某名流主張不坐黄包車、因爲用（人）拉（人），是不（人道）的，所以要坐就得坐汽車，否則直捷痛快，還是拐了二條腿，（安步當車）。不錯，這麽的（身體力行），就不怕黄包車夫不會不一個個餓死，於是乎中國的（野蠻），可以减少一些兒。但是不爭氣的我輩尶尬朋友，坐汽車，旣財力有所不逮，仰仗孤拐，又腿力有所未能，於是乎不得不借助於黄包車。雖然（人拉人）有些不（人道），但是黄包車夫之免填溝壑，究還有賴於我輩（不人道的大慈善家）。</p>
<p>一般人對於黄包車夫，雖然爲了一個子兒的爭執，竟要辱駡到黄包車夫的老子娘，以至於祖宗十八代，但是提起筆來，描寫黄包車夫的生活，倒又表示到一百二十分的同情與憐憫，甚至於黄包車夫背上的汗珠，就是作者的眼涙，雖然有時黄包車跑得喘不過氣來時，事實上，作者還在駡（猪玀，怎不跑快些！）　　黄包車夫的唯一（美德），自然是（拾金不昧）了，但是，强盜有時也會發善心，更遑論乎黄包車夫，但是，黄包車夫的不（拾金不昧）者，事實上比了（拾金不昧）者，究竟來得普遍些。至於因爲要把車子拉到弄裹，不瞪着眼，硬要增加二三個子車資，而不把坐車者辱駡一頓的，也同（拾金不昧）者，寥若晨星　　在北四川路，霞飛路，外灘，以及洋大人與高等華人的住宅區裹，黄包車夫果然可憐得不及一條狗，而更其是遇到客人側坐在車廂角裹，脚幾乎蹺到黄包車夫背上，十足地表演着（坐黄包車藝術）時，非擺出與汽車競賽的本領不可。但是從火車站，或是輪船碼頭上接得的客人，那麽，别有一副嘴臉，儘會走去了丨）到半路上，把車扛一摜，（這遠的路，不加錢我不拉！）</p>

<p>第十五回　客去含羞柔情蕩微笑　人來訪舊惡信啟愁懷</p>
<p>他道：聽說甘二爺在城裹頭已經有了事情，不和他哥哥作事了。桂枝紅了臉道：劉家媽，你也不提這個人罷，我對於這個人，也是恨透了。您是不知道，有一天，我送活到他们家去，他们家把我哄了出來，我是個姑娘，又是窮人，有什麽法子對付人家，只好忍受了。所以一直到於今，提到了甘積之，我就腦袋痛。劉家媽一聽，原來是爲此不滿意甘家，也就怪不得自己越說甘家，他就越是紅了臉了，這樣看來，自己知趣一點，還是少說話罷。當時也不敢多坐，談了幾句話，也就走了。但是劉家媽之爲人是與桂枝異趣的。他以爲和有錢的人來往，是有面子的事，反正只有我佔他的，没有他佔我的。而且他是一個年將衰暮的老婦人甘家也並不討厭他去。所以自從他在桂枝家裹聽過這一番話之後，不到二十四小時，那些話，就完全傳到甘太太耳朶裹去了。甘太太聽了，不但不氣，心裹倒着實的痛快一陣。覺得自己反對積之和桂枝來往，有先見之明，知道桂枝是不能夠和他合作的。這個消息，不能不讓積之曉得，以便讓他反悔一下。不過這個時候，積之在南苑大紅門敎書，也是郊外。由西郊外把消息傳到南郊外去，這可要費相當的週折，所以直到兩個月之後積之由南苑回城來買東西，遇着了一個親戚，才由一個親戚口裹，得着了一點消息。只是他這個學校是不容易離開的。連校長敎職員工友一共合算起來，才有四個人，南苑到海甸，作個來回，非一整天不可，他如何能離開學校一天。又是一個月之後，得了一個假期，他才趁了一個早，趕到西郊海甸來。（一九二）</p>

<p>奶奶給伊十多支香，伊嫌少，問奶奶耍。奶奶回答伊小孩子不能多插，伊目家也只拿了這麽點兒。但玲玲心兒裹忖您自家拿少，是因爲您老了，腰支兒彎不下去了，我可不像您哪！</p>
<p>哥哥在空着的花壇子上插了好多排兒香呌伊跑過去瞧。伊瞧明白那是幾個字兒，伊吟道：（不要忘記今年是國貨年）！他又在一支大蘿蔔上插着好多香。那大蘿蔔的鬚上缚着一條繩子。他把這個（香球兒）舞着，舞着，在這麽一個没有月亮的晚上舞着，一個流星彈兒哪！伊瞧着怪羨慕的。</p>
<h3 id="c169">拉雜　酒人說酒話 <a href="#c169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— 俞友清</p>
<p>酒實在是件好東西，我们　開了李白的詩集，讀到了一一醉能消萬古愁一的詩句兒，多麽令人神往，不差，酒可以消愁，若說能消萬古愁，那不過老頭兒一句豪放語罷了。</p>
<p>（借問酒家何處有？牧童遥指杏花村。這首詩，經過許多人誦讀了。有人將它讀了破句：借問酒家何處有牧童，遥指杏花村（改成了長短句，我覺得此詩來得有味。</p>
<p>（酒逢知己干杯少），一個要好的朋友，忽然來了，眞可以把酒言歡，促膝談心。若然合了他鄉遇故知這句話，那末更加有滋味了。</p>
<p>（夜半客來花當酒）這句話，或者指鄉村地方而言。若然在繁華的都市中，那末請你放心，夜半客來，茶不必當酒用，你可以同你的來客，到跳舞塲中走一遭，酒的問題，可以解决了。卽使没有跳舞塲的城市，也不生阻力，你去開了棧房，不要說是酒，就是要飲酒看花，也很容易。</p>
<p>文君當鐵，相好穿犢鼻褌，這一對愛侣，想不到很合現代的潮流，寡婦嫁人，可以受法律的保障，娶了寡婦的人，也不是羞恥事，他倆戀愛成熟了，逃到别地去，一個執了酒壺當鑪，做了現代化的女招待女店員，一個穿了最時髦的短　做跑堂，解决他倆的生活問題，比較了什麽父子藥房，兄弟公司，　來得合作到底。相如本來是個文丐，爲了他的愛人，情願做跑堂，多麽來得眞摯，可以說（自從開酒店以來未曾有）的盛舉了。</p>
<p>畢吏部卓先生，爲了常常飲酒廢職，鄉鄰人家，酒釀熟了，他去偷飲，被掌酒的人，綁了起來，明早方才知道是吏部郎，放掉了索，請他在甕側大醉而去。這位卓先生，做了吏部即，還要偷人家酒吃，眞可以掉幾句腐話，一名十風流，不顧小節，一杯在手，萬事都休了。（萬事不如杯在手。）我们走過了賣酒家的門口，看見許多酒客，手中拿了杯兒，一副欣喜的面孔，多麽好看，他们覺得手中執了酒杯，萬事都不管，眞合了（壺囊乾坤大）這句話咧。劉伶作酒頌，我覺得比周公作酒誥，來得誠眞些他老頭兒恨不得個個人同他一沐三握髮，一飯三吐哺的樣，無怪他要作酒誥了，那位伯通先生，看破了一切，愛酒若命，願意醉死，所以他要人家荷鍾相隨，死便埋我，這句話，多麽的幽默而深切，蕭伯訥畢竟不及酒聖人了　　信陵醇酒婦人，這句話，翻譯起來，就是吃酒玩女人，想不到現在的跳舞場，開香檳酒，玩舞女，倒被那位趙公子捷足先登了。本來酒色兩途，世界上的人们，很難逃過的，况且現在是人肉透露的時代，更加不能看得透跳得過了。我想起孔老夫子也說過的，他說：（我未見好德如好色者也。）。還有句話：（惟酒無量，不及亂）。照這樣看來，酒未嘗不可飲，女人也未曾不可玩，究竟好德的人是呆鳥。現在國事如此，不必管他，還是把了酒杯，挾了舞女，或者徵妓侑酒，何等有趣，文言說是風流，白話說浪漫，風流浪漫，正合了現代的人生觀咧。</p>
<p>酒國中最有名的，當然是淳子　老先生了。他吃酒會吃出花樣來，一斗亦醉，一石亦醉，倒是一個葫蘆肚皮，能大能小。本來飲酒是一般興趣，苟能羅襦襟解，微聞薌澤，到那時候，不要說一石亦醉，就是再加上了幾個一石，他老先生未必見得要醉吧。史記中這段幽默的文字，我想贈給逛舞場的人们，使他们多得一些訣竅啊。</p>

<p>— 虞明</p>
<p>上司的行動不必徵求下屬的同意，這是天經地義。但是，有時候上司會對下屬解釋。</p>
<p>新進的世界聞人說：（原人時代就有威權，例如人對動物，一定强迫牠们服從人的意志，而使牠们抛棄自由生活，不必徵求動物的同意。）這話說得透澈。不然，我们那里有牛肉吃，有馬騎呢？人對人也是這樣。</p>
<p>日本耶敎會主敎最近宣言日本是聖經上說的天使：（上帝要用日本征服向來屠殺猶太人的白人……以武力解放猶太人，實現舊的上的預言）。這也顯然不徵求白人的同意的，正和屠殺猶太人的白人並未徵求過猶太人的同意一樣。日本的大人老爺在中國制造（國難），也没有徵求中國人民的同意。丨至於有些地方的紳董，却去徵求日本大人的同意，請他们來維持地方治安，那却又當别論。總之，要自由自在的吃牛肉，騎馬等等，就必須宣布自己是上司，别人是下屬：或是把人比做動物，或是把自己作爲天使。</p>
<p>但是，這裹最要緊的還是（武力），並非理論。不論是社會學或是基督敎的理論，都不能夠產生什麽威權。原人對於動物的威權，是產生於弓箭等類的發明的。至於理論，那不過是隨後想出來的解釋。這種解釋的作用，在於製造自己威權的宗敎上，哲學上，科學上，世界潮流上的根據，使得奴隸和牛馬恍然大悟這世界的公律，而抛棄一切翻案的夢想。</p>
<p>當上司對於下屬解釋的時候，你做下屬的切不可誤解這是在徵求你的同意，因爲即使你絶對的不同意，他還是幹他的。他有他的夢想，只要金銀財寶和飛機大砲的力量還在他手裹，他的夢想就會實現；而你的夢想却終於只是夢想，丨丨萬一實現了，他還說你抄襲他的動物主義的老文章呢。</p>

<p>（五）柴米油鹽</p>
<p>（梁溪漫志，）載有（士人祈閒適）一則，說神問士人：（汝何所欲？）他答道：（某之所欲甚微，非敢過望，但願此生衣食粗足，逍遥山間水濱，以終其身足矣。）神說，（這是神僊之樂，你得不着。）這寓言，說明了什麽呢？就是在宋代，田園詩人的夢，已經爲（生活）打擊得粉碎了。所以，明人小說中所載的一首詩：</p>
<p>柴米油鹽醬醋茶，</p>
<p>七般都在别人家。</p>
<p>我也一些憂不得，</p>
<p>且鋤明月種梅花。</p>
<p>實際上巳經是（偶然的）現象，或者是（聊以自慰）的話了。明月梅花旣不可餐，鋤如何拿得起，人又靠什麽來活着呢？到是（蓮坡詩話）裹的一首詩很有意思：</p>
<p>書畫琴棋詩酒花，</p>
<p>行年件件不離他。</p>
<p>而今七事都更變，</p>
<p>柴米油鹽醬醋茶。</p>
<p>悠閒的生活，精心的研究，在生活不安定的形勢之下，是辦不到的。整日盤旋在你腦際的柴米油鹽醬醋茶，總歸會防害你的思索的。這樣的詩，眞是生活諷剌的好詩。事實上是没有了悠閒的調子了，所有的至少將是（全家都在風聲裹，九月衣裳未剪裁）一類的哀訴吧。這種苦惱，我们要如何解救它？</p>
<p>（六）應酬文範</p>
<p>明楊循吉（蘇談）載：</p>
<p>周伯器往來吳中，常以文自賣。</p>
<p>平生所作，蓋將千篇。開卷視之，自初至終，非堂記則墓銘耳。甚至有慶壽哀挽之作，亦縱横其間。然伯器之才，特長於此。每爲人作一篇，必有所得，多或銀一兩，少則錢一二百文耳。伯器每諾而許之，一日作數篇不竭。精粗問出，在乎得者遇之。然伯器稍舉筆，便得文章，細字正書，雖趁草亦然，不見其勞也。豈其才固有長於此者乎？及旣死，所遺論著無一篇。識者惜其有才而錯用之也。</p>
<p>我曾經寫過一篇（答應文章），但以全生精力專門從事這一工作的人，還不曾提到，而且我也不知。近讀（蘇談），得此則，我覺得大可以補充一下。像桐村這樣的文人，可說是答應專家了。書坊老閭，大可以把他的集子印出，算做（應酬文範），在需要應酬的現在，生意一定會興隆的吧。</p>

<p>這些話是有可以首肯之處的。不過，我们看到，無論怎樣的作家，當創造丨丨或者應該說描寫丨一個典型的人物時，常不免於誇大和做作。即如屠格湼夫筆下的巴札洛夫或羅亭，也是很有誇大和做作之點，要使讀者認識在這裹是有着一個時代的典型。此外如西萬提司的（吉訶德先生），岡却洛夫的（奥勃洛莫夫），魯迅的（阿Ｑ），假如作者在其人物的典型的特質上，不加一點誇大和做作，那麽這人物就不成其爲典型，因爲典型的特質，平常是混雜在許多普通的氣質裹面，不經誇大和做作丨丨即電影藝術上所謂（特寫）丨丨是不甚顯明的。我们在鄉下，日常與許多帶有（阿Ｑ氣）的人物相見相處，但未經魯迅特寫的時候，我们對這阿Ｑ的特質的認識，總没有讀了（正傳）以後那樣的明切。　　因此，沙寗之所以不成其爲一個時代的典型，根本就因爲社會的地位並無這樣的人物的存在，與作者的藝術製作力，我看是無多大闗係的。</p>
<p>在俄國文學中，有許多作家曾經創造了時代的典型的人物。巴札洛夫那樣，是（不折不扣的新時代的鄒型），其中含着（新的產生的希望）的。但也有反映舊時代的破產，作爲卑弱的人性的典型而出現的，如前面提起過的羅亭，奥勃洛莫夫，還有梭羅古勃的（小鬼）中的貝累陀諾夫。</p>
<p>貝累陀諾夫，是中學敎師。他的一生的生活目標，是想做一個視學官。因此他被他的從姊妹瓦爾瓦拉所騙，說是有一位公爵夫人，願意給他一個視學官的位置，要是他能夠和瓦爾瓦拉結婚。但是他要求做視學官在先，結婚在後。終於瓦爾瓦拉僞造了公爵夫人的委任狀，他们就結婚了。然而，最後有人　他說破這塲圈套，他憤怒極了，竟至殺人。梭羅古勃非但把貝累陀諾夫的性格寫得很卑賤弱小，其他的人物，也都是醜惡的一類。全書中，除了描寫一對青年男女的戀愛的優美的數章以外，差不多完全是人性的卑劣的描寫。以一種性格的悲劇爲基調，而加入許多喜劇的要素，技術是極其精緻的。這書，最初於一九○五年發表於（人生問題）雜誌，陸續博得許多讚賞和駡詈。駡的人說此書的主人公貝累陀諾夫實係作者梭羅古勃自身之肖像，斷定梭羅古勃就是這樣醜惡這樣卑劣的人物。梭羅古勃對此，曾有所答辯，他說：</p>
<p>（誠然，世人是喜歡被人所愛，并且願意把他们的靈魂中的崇高的方面顯示出來。即使在要人们的身上，他们也是希望看出善的閃光，即古時所謂（神性的閃光）（Ｌ'etincelle　devine）來的。要是有人作了眞實的，正確的，曖昧的，醜惡的肖像畫給他们看，他们是不相信的，并且會這樣想：（這是作者在說他自己啊！）</p>
<p>（然而不然；親愛的同時代的人们呀，我在小鬼中所寫的，是你们自己呢。裹面的許多人物，都是你们中間的人呢。這小說，是一面極光的鏡子，是我極當心地費了大功夫磨成的。牠的表面是平滑的，質地是純粹的。我曾煞費苦心，力求正確。無論何物，反映在這上面，一點不會走樣，各還他一個原樣的美醜。）</p>
<p>現在的新文學，是作爲指路碑的了，但確有一個長長的時期，文學是作爲人生的鏡子的，新寫實主義與舊寫實主義之不同點，也許就在此。但在指路碑的旁邊，放幾幅眞實，正確的肖像畫，指示舊路上的魔鬼僵屍，使人嫌憎恐怖，俞增嚮往新路的熱心，這樣的文學，現在還是需要的罷？</p>
<p>（小鬼）至今尙無中文譯本。大概是翻譯家们預料没有人要看，所以不譯的罷丨此外，則現在的信任創作，厭忌翻譯的趨勢，也是個原因。然而，倘有這樣的書出來，我知道看的人是一定多的。爲什麽呢？因爲貝累陀諸夫型（Ｐeredon</p>
<p>ovschina）的人，在我们眼前是太多了，單是我们的文壇中，巳不勝枚舉。倘給造一面鏡子，他们自己一定會顧影自憐，旁人也一定會引爲殷鑑的。</p>
<p>吳敬梓作（儒林外史），吳沃堯作（二十年目睹之怪現狀，）雖然（藝術製作力薄弱），但這些書的影響是大的。我希望現在有藝術製作力豐厚的作家，把現代中國的小鬼的典型寫了出來丨但志在中傷個　，揭發陰私而且並無藝術製作力的許多小報文豪，則非其選也。</p>

<p>— 趙景深</p>
<p>鄭板橋（送都轉運盧公詩）說：（清詞頗似王摩詰，復以精華學杜陵，）這話可說是等於說他自己。我们看他的（法海寺訪仁公），（同起林上人重訪仁公），（山中夜坐）等篇都像是學王，而（七歌），（哭犉兒），（悍吏），（私刑恶），（還家行）等詩就很像杜甫的（同谷縣作），（石壕吏），（無家别）這一類的詩。（署中示舍弟墨）云云：（詩學三人，老瞞與焉。少陵爲後，姬旦爲先。）第三句可爲學杜作證。</p>
<p>板橋詩多信筆寫來，不加檢點；所以一首好詩，每每露出狐狸尾巴。如（白門楊柳花）末句：（陌上游人盡愛儂，儂得郎憐然後可），又（十日菊）末句云：）避得暖風禁得凉），都覺生硬而無詩意（音布）一詩，筆酣墨舞，是板橋本色（范縣詩）以第二首寫桑旁小兒女的爲最好。</p>

<p>— 英國約瑟康拉德作　侍　桁　譯</p>
<p>在他的面前，太陽在樹梢上漸漸地昇起，霧出了一角。微風是清凉的；輝耀的光彩照着漣漪的水面顯在湖上。樹林也露出清晨的明淅的陰影，變得更清楚了，好像它们更逼近了一些，而那樹葉的動蕩，樹枝的摇擺，也好像突然地停止了。在無情的陽光中，自然界的聲籟高起來，以一種不可理解的話語，在訴說着人類的啞然的哀愁。阿薩特的眼光慢慢地漂動着，凝視着那昇起的陽光。</p>
<p>（我什麽東西也看不見了。）他使人聽不見地那樣自言自語地說。</p>
<p>（本來就没有什麽東西啊。）那個白人說，走到竹台的角上，對他的船揮手。從湖水上微微地傳來了呼呌聲，舢板開始向着這幽靈之友的家飛行了來。</p>
<p>（如果你願意同我一起來的話，我可以等你一個早晨，）那個白人說，眼光看着水面。</p>
<p>（不，屠安，）阿薩特輕柔地說，（在這房裹，我將不能吃，不能睡，但是第一我必需看見我的路。現在我是什麽也看不見了丨丨什麽也看不見了！在世界裹是没有光，没有平和；只是死，無數人的死。我们是同一個母親的兒子，可是我丢棄他於敵人的手裘；但現在我要回去了。）</p>
<p>他喘了一口大氣，仍然以那迷夢似的調子繼續着說。</p>
<p>（過一會兒，我便可以看得清楚了，我便能夠鬥戰丨丨鬥戰。但是她已經死了，而……現在……黑暗。）</p>
<p>他揮起了他的雙臂，隨後沿着身體使它们滑落下來，再以那不動的面孔和石頭似的眼睛凝視着太陽。那個白人跑上了船。划手靈巧地沿着船邊跑，而且從肩上回顧那一日的厭倦的旅程的起點。頭上裹着白布的船長，鬱悶地坐在船尾，使他的漿滑在水上。那個白人雙臂搭在小艙的草頂上，回望着船身激起的閃光的漣漪。當舢板還没有走出湖面到達河口的時候，他揚起了他的眼光。阿薩特始終没有動。在烈日的光裹，他孤獨地站立着；他是越過了一個無雲的白日的光明而探進了一個幻之世界的黑暗襄去了。（完）</p>

<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份呈初堅繼跌之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥好一角、坎拿大好四角左右、故開價時、人心繼續見俏、近遠期續好近分、惟過此之後、又復漸落、因洋米麥雖有徵稅之消息、不過目下正患滯銷、似無需要可言、所以廠家一抛、市氣復返跌、迨至下午開盤、各月份形勢、均見疲滯、不過廠家抛量、略見减少、跌勢遂亦見懈、照最近情形、終須實銷暢旺、市面方可有望、否則重重積壓、轉身爲難矣、結果本月份較前日反小一分、十月份小一分七厘半、十一月份小二分二厘半、十二月份至二月份各小二分半云、</p>

<p>西洋參產於美利堅，性能滋陰隆火，凡患虚火牙痛陰虚勞嗽，服之頗著奇效。分毛光兩種，（卽連皮與去皮）去皮者一名光參，又名正面參，以色白，質輕，性鬆，氣芬芳；頭端圓方面粗，梢尾尖細；（枝頭大小甚多，服食以三百枝爲適中）表面近頭，横紋深密；條多短肥叉枝；味初嚼頗苦，含片刻漸轉甘味；爲上品。近年美商以僞貨益形充斥，故更增不去表皮之連皮參（卽毛參）一種。質，形，性，味，與光參相同，惟多一黄灰色之深縐表皮。内肉仍爲糯白，因其難作僞，故買客多趨之。</p>
<p>西洋參價貴，每斤需八九十元。而假參出。假參係用東洋參擦去表皮經過精巧之手續，使其形態類似眞參。某國人特爲設廠製造，以爲亂眞。吾國奸商貪其價廉，每斤價僅十元左右，販賣以戕害同胞。蓋東西洋參之性質，適相反，東洋參提氣助火，服之口燥面赤，終至咳血傷身。僞西洋參一名副光，或稱賽光又名横紋。色呆白微黄。質堅實，枝條瘦長，無分粗細，更無短肥叉枝；兩端平秃，紋雖稍有而甚疎淺，形枯氣酸，味淡微苦而兼澀，間有黏舌者，數嚼卽無味。　　西洋參片，因已切成極薄之片，眞僞尤不易辨，以細糯而中心起菊花紋者爲眞，然仍多攙雜僞片，買客每有以嘗嚼其味苦與否爲辨者，殊不知市僧每於未切前，浸於金鷄納霜或龍胆草之水中，使其味苦，故仍不足爲證也。</p>
<p>近更有剪口，折尾，大尾，中尾，細尾，洋參鬚，等名目，或每兩一元左右，美其名曰吃坯，以迎合貪圖便宜之顧客，此類貨品，卽内行亦艱於鑑别，買客更宜慎之。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3 id="c240">談君子　乾序 <a href="#c240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>一提到君子，就使我们想到（鏡花緣），雖然牠已表明是（鏡花），然也有不少地方是具有深刻的寓意的。不過牠在（君子國）的一段描寫裹，竟把那須（君子）描寫得那樣的（謙謙然），例如：兩個人對面行來，誰也不肯先走，必定要偏着身子讓對面的人先過來，而對面的人也是同樣的偏着身子謙虚着，結果是廢話一大堆，甚至於憤而回身願意迂道的；還有商人的願意不顧血本將貨物送给人家……顯然（作僞）的描寫，轉失了（寓言）的本質了。</p>
<p>對於（君子）的解釋，也有各種的不同。普通是認爲對（小人）而發的，（舉動必循乎禮，言行必合乎義），就是一般的（君子觀）了。而此（禮）此（義），也並没有絶對的定義，舉凡忠，孝，節，信，公平，正直，和靄，謙恭……等好字眼，大概均爲（君子）所佔有，而可以得到人的欽敬。然而不幸得很，流傳了數千年以至今日的（君子）的行爲，却被人斥爲（吃人的舊禮敎）而要予以打倒了；然而也有人同時在高呼着提倡，保存，我國的（固有的美德）。</p>
<p>（舊禮敎）的應當保存與否，或者是應當打倒與否，我是絶對的没有成見。上古人的所謂（君子），據汪靜之先生的解釋，是應當作（上等人）解的，他於（詩經選註）的（闗睢）一章裹的（窈窕淑女，君子好逑）的註釋是，（君子，是貴族階級，有爵位，有權勢，在社會上地位很高，爲當時女子心目中之理想人物。向來解作君子小人之君子·誤。……）他解作（上等人）（貴族階級）的理由，是（君子）可以作爲（國君之子）解故。</p>
<p>然而也有人把（君子）解作（混賬王八蛋）的，那要推（語絲）三十八期的魏建功先生的大胆與痛快。我把他的原文（魏風伐檀）一章抄在下面：</p>
<p>詩經原文：（坎坎伐檀兮，實之河之干兮：河水清且漣漪丨不稼不穡，胡取禾三百　兮？不狩不獵，胡瞻爾庭有懸貆兮？彼（君子）兮，不素餐兮！）</p>
<p>魏先生的釋文：（檀樹伐得空空的嚮，樹段擱在河邊上；河水泛着清澄澄的細波浪丨不種田不種地，爲何平白地拿糧三百石？没結網没放槍，幹嗎看見你院子裹掛着些狐兎貂狼？唉！那此（混賬王八蛋），無菜不下飯！）</p>
<p>我们不須批評他釋得怎樣，祇他那滑稽而辛辣的筆調，已是值得欣賞的了。而所謂（君子）也實在夠受的了。</p>
<p>晋初的阮籍，似乎是一個崇尙自然主義的思想家，他非常的崇拜自由，而那時的所謂（君子），却不許他自由；他鄙棄那虚僞的禮法，而那時的（禮法之士，疾之若讐）。所以他終於祇能以詩酒來消遣他的餘年，以痛哭來發洩他胸中的塊品丨當時的（君子）们，曾　致的嗤他爲（狂奴）。那時的（禮法之士）是非常的趾高氣揚的。</p>
<p>然而在現在，不論那（君子）是指（上等人）（貴族階級）或者是（混賬王八蛋），對現在社會是絶對的没有絲毫益處，這是可以斷言的；即使牠是指（數千年的遺留）的所謂（小人的對象）而說，於現在民窮購　的中國，經濟破產的農村，失　充斥的社會，最低限度也是並不　要</p>
<p>所以君子）也者，如使不立刻　也人（　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　樹内陳列起來。</p>

<p>（愛人呀！讓我離開你，讓我永遠……）</p>
<p>啊啊！已是這樣妻澹的深秋月夜，爲什麽那對面的俄國少女的提琴，還要發出這樣使人心碎的哀音來呢？</p>
<p>這曲子，我是熟習的，而且是唯一的我所熟習的曲子。然而五年以來，我從不曾唱過一次，因爲這太剌激了：牠一開始，就把我拉回到最傷心處，使我爲已逝的夢境多流幾行徒然的眼涙。我曾打碎了我的提琴，我曾謝絶了一個學音樂的朋友，我處處提防，恐怕觸起這隻曲子的音響。雖然我不能抹去鐫刻在我的腦中的樂譜。</p>
<p>啊啊！我是要忘掉，忘掉那悲慘的塲面。我是怕聽到，聽到這哀怨的聲音呵！</p>
<p>你，你這年青的俄國女郎，你爲什麽不奏那前晚所奏的歡愉的曲子，却在這已是凄澹不堪的深秋月夜，奏出這樣使人心碎的哀音來呢？你有什麽哀怨，定要這樣呢？你不怕自己傷心，但你要知道，你在無　之間，把我拉回到已經過去的最傷心　了……</p>
<p>（什麽？便是曇花，也不見得萎落得這麽快罷？）</p>
<p>我分明記得·五年以前·在ＸＸ中學的蒙着淡月的校園裹，含了涙，最後地對她說了這樣的話。帶了質問的形式，但絶無質問的意味，語的時候，只是無可奈何地垂着頭。……我分明記得，她似欲有言，而倐　起立，颶脫我的手，一直走去……我又分明記得，她怎樣的俯伏在另一隻椅子背上，她的背部怎樣的在抽動，但當我追過去時，她又倐然起立，而且去回宿舍去了……我又記得，我怎樣地冒了風露，在校園裹痴立到天明……</p>
<p>她信裹和口裹所說的理由，有什麽正確？並不說她變了心，反說爲了我！短短的半年的愛，她說巳使我受了絶大的損失。她說怕我爲了她而消盡了壯志。她說我這半年中把學業抛荒，她說我這半年中把同志和友人疏遠，她責我忘記了偉大的責任？（社會是那樣地急需改造，爲一般有頭腦的青年所共感的。我们更當盡力負起我们的責任。）這是她信中的語言。她說我们不能再沉溺於戀愛。她說她要走了，而且要和我離開……</p>
<p>她對我的信竟一字不　。我的信中說她過於冷酷。趁我们年青的時候，熱烈地戀愛一下，有何不可；偉大的責任，自有來日可負，我自誓不是意志薄弱的青年，我終不會辜負她的期望，但是我决不能立時捨棄戀愛的權利………我記我的信箋，漬滿了點點的涙痕，我要打碎她的决心……爲是她竟一字不覆。　　考試臨到了示一塲，第三天就要放假了。而她還是不理我。眞是非離開不可了麽？我焦灼得腦袋快要爆烈。在敎室中，我永遠把眼光釘住她，然而，她連一眼也不來看我。臉是蒼白的，嚴肅得使我只得死心塌地。</p>
<p>音樂敎師宣布了考音樂的辦法。每個人獨唱一闋歌曲。唱歌也好，唱譜也可以，第八個輪流到她，她走到鋼琴旁邊，臉正對着我，我伏在案頭不敢望了；只是提着神，聽取她的美麗的歌喉，最後一次，啊啊，這是最後一次了！</p>
<p>她唱了，她唱的譜，第一句就剩進我的心底。我記得和這首謂相合的歌詞是這樣：</p>
<p>愛人呀！讓我離開你。</p>
<p>讓我永遠離開你！</p>
<p>並不是我心腸硬，實在是爲你着想。</p>
<p>倘我们再纒綿下去，你將有重大犧牲。</p>
<p>我不想你爲我犠牲，還不如和你分離。</p>
<p>這是我痛心的主張，還求你給我原諒。</p>
<p>愛人呀！我越是愛你，越不能不離開你！</p>
<p>當餘音消歇了的時候，我抬起頭，只見她的略有些潤濕的眼光正注着我，但一和我的目光相觸，她倐然低了頭，回到自己的坐位去了……</p>
<p>這樣的，是我和她離開的場面。至今五年，我不曾和她再見，只有這首傷心的歌曲，留在我心上作紀念，但是，我要漸漸地忘掉這歌曲，忘掉這場面了，我處處提防，不讓牠再現……然而今夜，你這俄羅斯的少女呵！你爲什麽讓你的提琴，奏出這樣的歌曲來觸及我的隠痛呢？在這樣凄淡的深秋月夜……</p>
<h3 id="c242">運動大家　鑑因 <a href="#c242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>ＸＸ院是上海的著名學府，學生很多。内中有一個球將李某，绰號（黑面虎），當然他的面顧是不能白了。因爲他非常神勇，所以人家給他一個虎的名稱，這（黑面虎）却只有二十歳，身軀已經高得可以賽過碧眼人。不過他雖然是一個運動大家，但可惜還認不滿百個中國字。至於球塲上幾個應用詞，却還識得，如（左翼）（右翼）（衝鋒）等字，對於英文，也是門外漢，只認得幾個（Ｂall'）（out　Side'）　（Pass）等字。可見他的中英文程度，是夠驚人了，何况他又是大學院的高材生呢。</p>
<p>這個ＸＸ學院，所以如此名震中外，爲的是賽球出名。因此（黑面虎）的功勞，也就不小。院長對他非常嘉慰，敎授對他也非常傾倒，同學们更是對他拜服。不用說個個人不敢得罪他，如果一個同學或是門房對他有不恭敬之處，他便馬上報告，一通斥退令下來了。</p>
<p>（黑面虎）自開學到散假，没有一天上過課堂，各科分數，却老是七八十分，無疑的這是敎授對他傾倒之故，所以不必經過什麽考試，就先給了他及格分數。於是他可以不要到校讀書，鎭日地</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>咖啡館，電影場，游泳池裹去瞎混。一切費用，都用校中會計處照領。不但如此；（黑面虎）的服裝，都由院中供給，學雜費，當然一律豁免的了。</p>
<p>球賽的時候到了，（黑面虎）坐了汽車，從萬人歡迎聲中，到得球塲，比起賽來。幸是他的足球本領不錯，所以没有一次不佔着上風，勝利而歸，歸後，於是香檳酒，洋菜，嚼了一大飽，一切開支，自有院中供給。</p>
<p>聽說什麽地方運動大會又開姑了。（黑面虎）少不得又勞他的玉趾光臨。於是銀盾，銀杯，滿載而歸，直把（黑面虎）歡喜得變成（笑面虎）！他吃的，住的，穿的，都可以說是（貴族化）。他對人說：（我的成功，全靠兩隻足，我有了兩隻足，儘可以榮耀享福一生！）　　光陰一天一天的飛過去，黑面虎的畢業期間到了。可是院長挽留他不必畢業，就在本校充長期球將吧。並且每月支ＸＸ元薪水。黑面虎也就一口承認。自是以後，他離得書本更遠了。堂堂大學畢業生，還是看不懂平常的家信，他的程度，也就登峯造極之至！</p>
<p>不久，（黑面虎）的厄運來了。是一個幽靜的清晨，他穿着運動背心，在運動塲上跑多，正在起勁的當兒，猛不防脚下一滑，跌了一交，這一來，（黑面虎）一生功業，就此告終！因爲他跑得太快之故，腿部巳跌得成了重傷。雖經名醫的治療，仍不免變了一個輕徹的（　脚。）於是（黑面虎）的綽號，便改爲（蹩脚虎）了。因此他不能再與人賽球，院長便停了他的薪給，下了逐客令。處於不得已的局面之下，他便回到了故鄉，迴想起往日的英名，不禁失聲痛哭！</p>
<p>年纪是二十開外了。他以爲（萬）能的兩隻脚，也没有効用了。可是飯是要吃的，職業是要的。他便不得不向四方去謀事，但是他有什麽技能呢？社會容得他這不學無術的人嗎？他到了這個時候，才萬分的懊悔起來。也想奮勉，也無由他去奮勉丨於是曾榮耀一時的運動大家（黑面虎）球將，便淪落潦倒了一生！</p>

<p>最近應友人之約，參加一次工廠管理同人叙談會。這是研究闗於工廠管理上的一切問題的團體。先由在坐同人輪流發表意見，然後再由大家加以討論。其中有一位已經幹了十餘年管理員工作的李君起立發言，頗有一記的價值。　　他說：（兄弟幹管理員的職務，巳經有十幾年了。覺得十餘年來因爲時代變遷的闗係，我们管理工人的方法，也爲適時勢合潮流起見變更了許多：那就是以（合理的指導）代替（　　的　壓）：譬如，有二個工人在工塲裹打架，互相扭做一團到你處來告訴。在十年之前，你如果扮起很威嚴的臉色，怒斥（雙方不準打架），再以（如若以後再打二人决定同時開除）的話來鎭壓一下，就可以把這二人的意見，威嚇得烟消雲散。但是如果在現在呢，那上面的方法是不適用了。因爲他们的智識理解力是進步了。他们二人爭諭，到你處來要求你評判，你若不用合理的調解方法而一味用威力來鎭壓，非但不能消滅他们倆的意見，並且覺得你是個無理性的人而同時要不服你的指揮了……）</p>
<p>誠然，時代是一天天在轉變的。非但管理工人的方法要適時勢合潮流，其實就是做民衆領袖的人，何曾不要適時勢合潮流？在從前，做民衆領袖的是皇帝，皇帝是高貴於一切的，威震四方。再加以軍政大權，一手在握，小民休想聞周；並且還創造出（君要臣死，不得不死）的預防反動的威嚇語，以資鎭壓。固然是能作威作福於一時，但是終究是敵不過時代的變更和潮流的湧進而潰崩了。在現代，民衆们的智識進步了，他们也覺悟到自身的使命。這時做民衆領袖的，若仍不幹些確實有利大衆的工作而再一味横蠻利用威力來鎭壓下去，非但是不着民衆的信仰，並且他的潰崩就在旦夕間了。</p>
<p>因爲現在是（順民者存），（逆民者亡）的時代。威力是不能鎭壓了。</p>

<p>第三幕　和平禮讚</p>
<p>馬弁：你看，你又這樣咬住我了。我是說有了這種好機會，正好……正好……，並不是說非等待日本兵來就不逃。現在我祗問你，假如趁大家慌慌張張的時候，我们想方法多拿幾樣貴重東西，不是更好一些嗎？</p>
<p>女僕：錯是不錯。可是小王，我告訴你，日本兵是不會打到北京來的。他们早說通了。你别做夢罷。今天早上我還聽到太太問老爺說：（要不要到上海去避避）：老爺說：（我巳經有辦法了。中國和日本巳在講和，北京馬上就要天下太平，還怕什麽呢？）這樣看來，老爺你是不預備逃的，所以我们也就没有希望了。</p>
<p>馬弁：那末太太的鑑石戒指什麽的，你是不是可以多拿得着一些呢？</p>
<p>女僕：那也不見得。上一個禮拜，這裹發現了日本飛機的時候，太太不是拿了一大箱的首飾存到外國銀行裹去了嗎？你不記得嗎？那天是你和她同去的。送到什麽地方，你該知道呀。</p>
<p>馬弁：哦哦哦，對了，送到臺灣銀行去了。</p>
<p>女僕：是囉，你還問我？（拿着茶具逕入内。）</p>
<p>少少爺：（自樓上下來）小王，你在這兒幹嗎？</p>
<p>馬弁：不幹什麽，小少爺。</p>
<p>小少爺：來，我们來賭牌九。</p>
<p>馬弁：不，回頭老爺下來要駡的。</p>
<p>小少爺：别怕爸爸不會來的。剛才他把我攆出來，　著房門，和姨娘睡午覺去了。牌九在那兒？快去拿來。馬弁：我也不知道在什麽地方，大概是廚房間他们拿去了。</p>
<p>小少爺：什麽，他们也賭錢嗎？回頭我　告訴爸爸，敎他们全滾蛋。</p>
<p>馬弁：你看，你又是少爺脾氣來了。難道你可以賭他们就不可以賭嗎？小少爺：那當然呀。他们是什麽東西？爸爸說過的。我大了一定要做總司令，所以現在得學會管用人。（帶兵是和管用人一樣的），爸爸說（假如用人管得像羊一樣的聽話，那末以後就能夠帶兵了。）</p>
<p>馬弁：哦！小少爺眞是一個有出息的人，這末一點年紀，便能夠說出這樣的一番大道理。</p>
<p>小少爺：那末現在没有牌九，我们就來打撲克罷。昨天我買的一副新撲克不是在你身上嗎？</p>
<p>馬弁：（自身上掏出撲克牌）牌在這裹，可是我身上没有錢。</p>
<p>小少爺：昨天我不是給了你五塊嗎？怎麽没有？</p>
<p>馬弁：我不是全輸給你了嗎？</p>
<p>小少爺：呸！瞎說，我又没有赢你的錢。再給你幾塊罷，拿去。（一握鈔票授給馬弁，他笑嘻嘻的受下。他们打撲克。）</p>
<p>小少爺：一塊錢看一看。</p>
<p>馬弁：一塊後面一塊。</p>
<p>小少爺：兩塊後面四塊，</p>
<p>馬弁：好，四塊，看！</p>
<p>小少爺：同花！</p>
<p>馬弁：同花順字！（赢，一卷鈔票。）</p>
<p>（馬弁顯然以偷牌的方法赢了許多錢。）</p>
<p>聲：（姨娘在喊。）李媽！打盆熱水上來。</p>
<p>女僕：來了。（在内麽。旋端了一盆水走上樓梯，見馬弁又在和少小爺賭錢，擠一擠眼睛，馬弁亦得的一笑。）</p>
<p>馬弁：爸爸醒來了，我们還是到那邊花一園裹賭去罷。（小少爺跟下）</p>

<h3 id="c246">美國影業國外市場的消失及如何改破當前的危機 <a href="#c246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— 王炎之</p>
<p>在無聲影片時代，美國影業的國外市塲丨尤其是歐洲至爲暢銷。他们每套影片的裝作費，就國内已可收回，而由國外市塲收入的，也可達收入總數的十分之四。及至聲片時代，國外市塲日漸消失，這原因是方言不同，滯銷乃莫可避免的現象。美國影界對此曾用盡種種方策，冀奪回已失市塲。譬如聘請歐洲著名優伶拍戲，以便號召歐洲觀衆，每片除英語牌外加製各國版：或者至歐洲設立攝影塲，攝製迎合歐洲人心理的影片等，可說是用盡人智所能及方法，然結果歐洲的地盤仍日益縮少。這原因若詳細說來，未免太過冗長，現在祗抉其概要叙述如下：</p>
<p>在現狀底下的德，法，英，伊及其他歐洲諸國，他们都爲保護國產影片的計劃。况且在國粹主義的墨索里尼統治下之意大利，與希特勒統治下之德國，美國影片自然要感受格外的重壓。希特勒的排猶運動中，猶太系之美國人且驅之出境，故對猶太人執牛耳之美國電影業更莫望其援且。試看！從前派拉蒙在德國設立的分社，現在已收拾回國了。更說句非武斷的話，今後美國的電影，也許再無機會得在德國的銀幕上公映（在希特勒統治時代）</p>
<p>此外，如在法國與英國設立的攝影場和電影院，也因經濟上的失敗而結束。總而言之，現在美國影業的海外市塲，只有英國殖民地及南美以至東亞諸國，因此，美國影業對海外收入總數也只及從前的三分之一而已。</p>
<p>就歐洲的國民性而論丨不要說政治限制，他们决不願花錢去看講外國話的影片，所以第一步所謂打開危機的對策是加製外國語版，然而這事並不簡便，他们每套影片至少要花八千至一萬五千美金。所以他们此際除特作品外，巳不再加製外國語版知。</p>
<p>第二步，他们感着國外市塲消失，國内收入减少，從消極方面，只有裁汰人員與節約經費。這一層頗覺厲行，如派拉蒙公司，對於人員薪水，巳實行每年裁减二百萬美金。此外如攝製費的裁减，與攝製時間的縮短。從前一套普通片須費四五週，現在則缩至三週以内完成。</p>
<p>其他如對從事銀幕工作的人員，倘其紅運稍退，不管他是過去明星，都在擯棄之列。他们一方面則竭力發見和養成新的明星，因爲後進明星價廉，他们的經費可以節省也。</p>
<p>總而言之，現在美國的電影界正在努力，拚命，和這危機奮鬥，倘不幸，這種情况再延長數年，那麽他们的前途是無望的。</p>

<h3 id="c247">我評（姊姊的悲劇） <a href="#c247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— 洛濤</p>
<p>本刋前載李仁君對胡萍編劇兼主演的（姊姊的悲劇），在該片的内容和意識方面，曾有嚴正的批評，現在我再來補充一些。</p>
<p>這影片的故事本身，是太過於簡單平凡；而且很不眞實，譬如說（復仇思想的糾正），（革命意志的啓發），這和片子的内容却恰恰相反。應生姊弟的剌殺汪大少爺，這完全是一種個人主義的復仇思想，誠如李君所評，這種暗殺方法是没有出路的，這麽可說是糾正呢？　　導演對於這部片子没有什麽多大的貢獻，只有開塲時父女從上海回家時誇張上海的一叚，暗伏將來的再去上海而已。</p>
<p>在開始時扮弟弟的鄭小秋爬上樹去看一段，我覺得不甚好，一則因爲小秋是那麽胖，二則是像這麽大的一個弟弟·照歳家的習慣他應該去從事於耕種工作，不應該空閑着爬在樹上玩了。</p>
<p>還有，女兒隨着父親到上海去玩，這理由我也不很明白，照他们那末窮忙的人家，還有這許多空時間和金錢到上海來玩麽？</p>
<h3 id="c248">評（姊姊的悲劇） <a href="#c248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>— 漪</p>
<p>（上略）這片故事的開始是顯出農村的破產。　住　　題材，固是很可喜的，但到了弟弟被捕　後却是畸形的發展了。還有憑空插入了四角戀愛所爭風吃醋，也似乎覺得太累贅，尤其是結局，地主兒子的被剌死以完成全劇，未免陷了幻想的泥沼，幾乎使這充滿着悲憤的悲劇變成喜劇了</p>
<p>農村旣被壓榨得要去請求地主减租，而失望回來却從城内帶來了許多洋布，這是矛盾的。爲了要使觀衆明白農村的原因，而用這個法子來說明，是弄巧成拙了。還有，字幕上告訴我们莫新是一個窮小子，那末，他的父親怎能令（會計處）匯給他四百塊錢供給他買參考書呢？這也是使我们引爲疑竇的一點。　　在演員方面，我覺得胡萍和王夢石表演得最好，似乎有的變化，這是劇旨使她這樣的，非如此，故事就鬆懈無力了。她這悲憤而充滿着殺氣的臉相，正是她出色的地方。王夢石從出塲到溺斃在河中，始終充滿着嚴肅和眞實的情感，他是配角中最好的一個。龔稼農因出塲很少，没有特殊的印象給我们。王獻齋和王微信表演平平。顧梅君表情太硬裝，鄭小秋的動作欠眞實，簡直没有面部表情。</p>

<p>金髮友郎琪恩哈羅自她的丈夫保羅伯恩自殺後，曾一度痛不欲生，但知者俱謂其不久將覓得如意郎君而再醮。今得本日好萊塢消息，琪恩哈羅已於昨晚（十八日）乘飛機赴阿立桑那州游馬地方與好萊塢著名攝影師名洛森者（Ｈarold</p>
<p>G.rossen）結婚。婚禮舉行時爲今晨四時三十分。主持婚事者爲游馬當地之知事。婚後琪恩哈羅卽復乘機遄返好萊塢。七時抵好卽入攝影場繼續工作，可謂忽促者矣。至新郎過去。吾人知者甚尠，但知其爲攝影師，年三十八歳，歐戰時曾參加行任者云。</p>

<p>聯華一廠，卜萬蒼十分忙碌籌備開拍的（幼年中國）不日卽可開始拍製。此劇原與（母性之光）同時編成但因此劇内容繁重，每個角色都極重要，非經縝密研求及有從容之時間策劃一切不可，故爲慎重考慮，求其精良，先開拍了（母性之光）在（母性之光）攝製過程中以及最近兩個月來，卜導演無時不在此劇之内容以及各角色上大絞腦汁。該劇本現已經劇審大會通過，故社會人士渴望於卜導演繼（母性之光）之作品，最近期間可望拍起矣。</p>

<p>聯華二廠，日前僱了五部汽車由蔡導演楚生率領了袁叢美，尙冠武等職演員多人赴靜安寺路和霞飛路兩處拍取（漁光曲）外景。此行衆人及僱了這幾部汽車，不過是要拍何仁齋來滬梁月舟接他登岸途經鬧市的一個鏡頭。長度也不過十尺左右，然而毫不苟且的藝人對這雖然短短的一個鏡頭，竟不肯馬虎從事，除一部汽車安置影機和坐着兩個要角之外，三部汽車載滿了行李跟在後邊。最後的一部，便是劇務人員和工友们來坐。時間的虚耗是裝影機於汽車之前，廢夫半小時，在馬路上沿途物色適當的背景再廢去一小時又半。然而結果只拍了兩個短短的鏡頭以備選用而已，這麽慎重其事與費了這許多物力和光陰，將來在銀幕上，觀衆眼前只不過轉瞬卽逝罷了。</p>

<h3 id="e20">Observations on Hirota's Diplomacy by Zi <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Foreign Minister Koki Hirota took office on the 14th. Superficially, after Uchida's scorched-earth diplomacy ran into a wall, a new person was appointed. Japan's diplomacy towards China seems destined for some changes. However, in reality, the Japanese political situation is entirely controlled by military figures like Araki. Since Araki and others have made the fundamental policy of forcibly occupying our Northeast and supporting their manufactured puppet state, no matter who is changed as foreign minister, the relationship between China and Japan cannot be substantially altered. This is a situation easily understood by the general public.</p>
<p>For several days, Japanese news agencies have continuously broadcast news about Hirota's new diplomatic policy. We have synthesized and studied those related to China. His pretense of respecting the independence of (Manchukuo) to continue occupying our Northeast is the same as Uchida's. His desire to make China abandon the Northeast as a form of surrender-like friendship with Japan is also the same as Uchida's. The difference is that Uchida advocated a policy of quiet observation, while Hirota declared the adoption of a positive policy. However, the key point of Uchida's quiet observation was to wait for China's natural development without coercion. Hirota's proactive policy is to (make China, for its own interests and happiness, automatically change its current attitude towards Japan.) His intention to treat China with a "inviting the enemy into an urn" tactic is no different. Our understanding of Hirota comes from important information: (1) In his early years, Hirota was indignant that the land obtained by Japanese soldiers through bloody battles was lost due to weak diplomacy when Japan was subjected to the Triple Intervention and returned Liaodong to China. (2) Hirota also privately drafted a proposal for the Twenty-One Demands that Japan previously made to China, intending to infringe upon our sovereignty in the Yellow River basin through conspiracy. Combining these two, it is evident that Hirota will certainly collude with Araki and others, giving full play to the abilities of Japanese military diplomacy.</p>
<p>According to Japanese propaganda, Hirota's approach to China will be different from previous foreign ministers, a completely unprecedented and revitalized diplomacy. Before today, we have not seen any possibility of revitalization in Sino-Japanese diplomacy while Japanese military diplomacy remains unchanged. However, since Japan withdrew from the League of Nations, it has suffered from isolation for a long time. Perhaps Hirota wants to seek another path to achieve revitalization. The path that we can predict is likely to utilize the so-called interdependent political and economic relationships of today's world, changing his attitude towards Britain and France, directly reducing the influence of the great powers that hinder Japan's oppression of China, and indirectly making China have no choice but to accept its enticement. If Hirota's revitalized diplomacy is indeed like this, then the day Japan completes its revitalized diplomacy will be the time China sinks into an irrecoverable abyss.</p>

<h3 id="e22">Japanese Coal Dumping Intensifies <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>The Future of National Coal is Extremely Dangerous</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to the inspection committee, the dumping of Japanese coal in China shows that the average selling price of Japanese coal in its own country is about 4.15 yuan, while the average selling price in Shanghai is about 5 taels. If freight, dock fees, customs duties, etc. are deducted and converted, the selling price at Japanese seaports is about 3 yuan, a dumping level of more than 1 yuan. The selling price of Fushun coal in Shenyang is about 7.7 yuan, in Dalian it is 10.1 yuan, while in Shanghai it is only 7.5 yuan, and it soon fell to 4 yuan. If railway freight, loading and unloading fees, and sea freight are deducted, the value at the mine is more than 6 yuan for coal transported to Shenyang and Dalian, and less than 2 yuan for coal transported to Shanghai, a dumping level of more than 4 yuan. Although China has now added a customs duty of 1.35 taels on Fushun coal, there is still dumping of more than 2.5 yuan that cannot be resisted. Japanese coal is also sold for only about 10 yuan per ton in Hankou and about 9 yuan per ton in Qingdao. At the same time, the freight for our country's coal transported from the north to Shanghai is already more than 10 yuan. Coal from Shanxi Province requires a freight of 6 yuan just to be transported from Kouquan to Fengtai. In this situation, how can it compete with Japanese coal? Therefore, a large amount of Chinese coal is stockpiled and difficult to sell. According to a survey by the Ministry of Industry, more than 1 million tons of coal slag from Kailuan No. 2 alone are stockpiled in Qinhuangdao, Hankou, and Wuhu. The Railway Bureau originally ordered 600 coal cars, but 200 have now been returned. It can be seen that the future of the coal industry is extremely dangerous. In addition to price cutting and dumping, the Japanese also use the method of lending money to Chinese merchants who are short of capital to promote the sale of Japanese coal.

<p>Paris Communiqué States that Franco-British Talks Were Well-Received</p>
<p>Davis Carries Roosevelt's Letter to Meet with French Authorities</p>
<p>(Paris) Two Franco-British meetings were held in Paris today, lasting a total of four and a half hours. The French representatives were French Prime Minister Daladier and Foreign Minister Pongou, and the British representatives were British Ambassador to France Douler and Undersecretary Eden. A joint communiqué was issued. According to the communiqué issued in the afternoon, the purpose of the talks was to study the current situation before the Disarmament Conference begins its work. The two sides exchanged views in a spirit of mutual trust and explained their governments' views on the various issues under consideration, in order to reconcile their views. The French Prime Minister told reporters that there has been progress since June, and the Franco-British viewpoints are now closer than before. (18th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Talks Were Well-Received (Paris) The talks between Britain and France covered all issues related to disarmament, except for naval issues. Both Britain and France felt that the results of the first day of talks were well-received, and there is a high possibility that their views will converge. Once this situation is realized, the success of the Disarmament Conference will be easier. British Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs Eden does not seem to have been assigned a negotiating task, and his mission is more of a visit. Therefore, Eden may return to the country by plane tomorrow for instructions. If so, Eden's trip to Rome will be postponed, and the Franco-British talks will be temporarily suspended. However, once British opinions are expressed, Britain and France can continue their talks. Some say that the time will be Wednesday, and the location will be either in Paris or Geneva. In any case, U.S. disarmament representative Davis and Disarmament Conference Chairman Henderson will be received by Foreign Minister Pongou tomorrow, so the issue of disarmament will ultimately be mentioned tomorrow. In addition, Britain and France have also exchanged diplomatic views with the Italian government, and the effect is somewhat optimistic. If this situation can continue, there will be a profound change in the situation of the Disarmament Conference. What can be determined at present is that the main parts of the French disarmament proposals have not changed in recent months. What Prime Minister Daladier intends to explain is still nothing more than the following point: first, establish a permanent international system of automatic and periodic disarmament inspections, and then engage in the reduction of armaments after a trial period of four or five years.

<p>(London) British Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs Eden returned to London by plane this afternoon to report to Prime Minister MacDonald on the progress of the Franco-British talks on disarmament. Then, the Cabinet will convene a special meeting. The Daily Express reported that Eden had a long conversation with the Prime Minister on the phone, saying that the nature of the French proposal on supervising German armaments may cause the Disarmament Conference to collapse.

<p>(Berlin) The possibility that Germany will effectively follow Japan in withdrawing from the League of Nations is widely expected. Britain and France are currently gathering in Paris to discuss this matter. Germany is paying close attention to it. Berlin newspapers hope that Britain will not be blinded by France's cover-up. Today, Dr. Folick, one of Hitler's advisers, gave a speech to 80,000 students, saying that if Germany's demand for equality in armaments is rejected, Germany will withdraw from all international conferences. Also, Dr. Rosenberg, Hitler's unofficial ambassador, stated today that if France refuses to fulfill its disarmament obligations, Germany will not be bound by the obligations under the Treaty of Versailles.

<p>(Paris) U.S. disarmament representative Davis arrived in Paris at the Gare du Nord at 5:45 p.m. today, after arriving from London, in order to participate in tomorrow's talks between British and French authorities. Disarmament Conference Chairman Henderson also arrived here in the same car as Davis. (18th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>According to reliable sources, when Davis meets with French authorities tomorrow, he will present President Roosevelt's letter. This letter was given to him by Roosevelt when Davis set off from the United States, and it is to be delivered to the French President. The content concerns the work of the Disarmament Conference, explaining in extremely sincere and simple terms the hope of the United States for the success of the Disarmament Conference. (18th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) As a forerunner to the Disarmament Conference, U.S. representative Davis received two telegrams from U.S. President Roosevelt while in London. Davis then sent one of them to British Prime Minister MacDonald, and the other telegram is said to be forwarded to French Prime Minister Daladier. Although the texts of the two telegrams are different, their content is consistent. It is heard that Roosevelt declared that the success of disarmament must be achieved through the real and simultaneous implementation of arms reductions; otherwise, the intention of disarmament can be arbitrarily falsified.

<p>(Paris) Disarmament Conference Chairman Henderson came to Paris yesterday in the same car as U.S. disarmament representative Davis. This morning at 10:00, he visited the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs and conferred with Foreign Minister Pongou, stopping at 10:50 a.m. because Henderson will take a train to Geneva at 11:18 a.m. Foreign Minister Pongou briefly described to Henderson the situation of his talks with British Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs Eden, but did not provide details, as Eden must first report the details to the British Cabinet, and then the British Cabinet will discuss them. Also, Foreign Minister Pongou is scheduled to receive Davis at 5:30 p.m., and Prime Minister Daladier will receive Davis at 6:30 p.m. (19th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Washington) After a British informal representative claimed today that the U.S. shipbuilding plan would hinder the success of disarmament, rumors spread that Britain had asked the U.S. to suspend shipbuilding. The State Department issued a statement denying this claim, but did not mention the former news. In addition, the State Department and other parties have stated that the U.S. President is determined to proceed as usual with the ships that have already been commissioned. (18th National Electric)</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, reliable sources here revealed that Britain has indirectly expressed to the U.S. government, through U.S. Ambassador Davis, that the U.S. naval shipbuilding plan has frustrated hopes for progress at the Geneva Disarmament Conference. It is heard that British representatives attending the Disarmament Conference told Davis that many European countries believe that if the U.S. expands its armaments, it would be futile to discuss disarmament. Furthermore, news of the U.S. Army Department's purchase of new equipment and fortification of coastal defenses is also sufficient to hinder the progress of armaments. It is also heard that when U.S. Ambassador Davis met with British and European politicians, he pointed out that naval disarmament has not yet been discussed at the Disarmament Conference. If naval armaments are considered in the future, the U.S. Navy will still be far behind Britain, making further reductions difficult. It is claimed that the U.S. President is currently studying Davis's report and preparing a response, which will also be informal, stating that the U.S. still hopes for substantial achievements at the Geneva Conference and will support the disarmament plan proposed by British Prime Minister MacDonald. In addition, it will also be pointed out that the U.S. firmly believes that land and air disarmament cannot be effectively agreed upon until France and Germany reach a satisfactory agreement. It is also heard that Davis, in addition to reporting the British attitude, also telegraphed the State Department that the possibility of Germany rearming has deeply worried representatives from various countries in Geneva, and the shipbuilding plans announced by Japan and the U.S. are also equally troubling. One politician told Davis that even if the U.S. were to agree to cancel its shipbuilding orders, there would still be little hope of persuading Japan to do the same. Currently, the U.S. President's attitude towards the entire disarmament issue will be explained in detail by Davis at the meeting of the main committee in Geneva on the 9th of next month. Meanwhile, official circles here believe that there is little hope of an early agreement on the reduction of land and air armaments, but among the twelve main issues, it may be possible to reach an agreement on several before Christmas.

<p>(Tokyo) According to information obtained by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday, the attitudes of various countries towards the upcoming Disarmament Conference are completely opposed. The future of the conference has long been viewed as hopeless. Japan regards this conference as a preliminary round for the Washington Conference in 1935 and does not expect any achievements in achieving the goals of disarmament at this conference. Therefore, based on this view, it will advocate the following points at every opportunity at the conference: (1) Instruct the Imperial representatives to repeatedly advocate the Japanese disarmament proposal put forward by Japan in February last year; (2) Clarify that the London Treaty will be revised at the end of 1936 and that a short-term treaty must be included; (3) Declare to China and foreign countries the attitude that the Washington Treaty must be revised in 1935 to change the ratios, etc. This intent has been telegraphed to Minister Sato.

<p>German-Italian Friendship Makes France Anxious</p>
<p>British Tactics Are Most Noteworthy</p>
<p>Great Powers Are Preoccupied; Seize the Opportunity</p>
<p>No Need to Rush for Recognition of the Puppet State</p>
<p>丨Talks After Nagaoka's Return to the Country丨</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese Ambassador to France, Haruichi Nagaoka, who was very active as Minister Plenipotentiary before Japan withdrew from the League of Nations, arrived in Tokyo at 9 a.m. on the 19th. According to the ambassador, who spoke to reporters in the car, the situation in Europe, especially the autocratic German's relation to France and Austria is extremely tense and countries are seeking to guarantee their safety. In particular, France's fervor is the highest. The recently concluded agreement among the four countries of Britain, France, Germany, and Italy is due to this aspiration. Since the great powers already have the Locarno Treaty in place, there is no need for a special agreement on security guarantees. Therefore, from a certain perspective, it evokes memories of the pre-World War I era. France is eager to suppress Germany and prevent its resurgence, but given the current situation, with Germany and Italy tending towards friendship, France is also uneasy. In this situation, Europe may be unavoidable from further disturbances, and clever Britain may extend its hand into the continent. Therefore, the Disarmament Conference convened by the League of Nations on October 16 is also pessimistic. The Chairman of the Disarmament Conference, Mr. Henderson, has worked hard to promote disarmament, but European countries regard it as a joke. In short, the European situation should focus on the Franco-German relationship, and although the forces of the surrounding countries are intertwined, there is no room to discuss policies. How it will change in the future is worth watching. France has very good feelings towards Japan and the industry is quite enthusiastic about investing in Manchuria. It is not necessary to demand recognition of (Manchukuo). Once the organization is complete, other countries will naturally recognize it. To demand recognition and investment in Europe, which has forgotten the Manchurian issue, would be an extremely foolish act. Our countrymen, be careful. (19th Nichiren Electric)</p>

<h3 id="e33">Construction of Air Force Base on Ogasawara Islands Clearly Violates the Washington Treaty <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>(London) The Times published a contribution today discussing the construction of fortresses on the Ogasawara Islands in the North Pacific, saying that some believe that Japan wants to turn Lloyd's Port into a naval and air force base. This action almost foreshadows Japan abandoning Rattron and other islands when it leaves the League of Nations in 1935. However, it can also be said that Japan wants to occupy Rattron and other islands for a long time, so it uses the Ogasawara Islands as a strong base for protection. In short, the base on Chichibu Island makes Japan's position in the Western Pacific almost unbreakable. The current conversion into an air force base seems to violate Article 19 of the Five-Power Treaty. The Ogasawara Islands are located in the northern Pacific Ocean, about 700 miles southeast of Japan. There are twenty islands of various sizes, but only half of them are large, divided into three parts: the northern part is called Parrys Island, the central part is called Beechey Island, and the southern part is called Bailey Island or Coffin Island. They are all volcanic islands. In 1827, British Captain Beechey went there and occupied it in the name of the United Kingdom. Japan reclaimed it in 1878. Lloyd's Port is its primary port. The Rattron Islands, also known as the Mariana Islands, number fifteen. They were originally owned by Spain. In 1898, the largest of them, Guam, was ceded to the United States. The remaining islands were sold to Germany the following year. In 1914, they were occupied by Australia and are now under Japanese mandate. (19th Reuters Electric)</p>
<p>(London) The Times editorial said that when the Washington Treaty was signed in February 1922, it is not known whether there were forts on the Ogasawara Islands. If they were not fortified at the time, and the current claim that Lloyd's Port has been converted into an air force base is true, then this change seems to be a violation of Article 19 of the Washington Treaty. Assuming that Chichibu Island was not fortified in 1922 and this preparation only occurred ten years later, it would naturally raise suspicions of violating the treaty. However, Japan is unwilling for outsiders to have the opportunity to inspect its naval and air force exercises near the Ogasawara Islands or study its conversion of Lloyd's Port and commercial aviation ports, leading to misunderstandings. It is hoped that this is the truth of Japan's attitude. Otherwise, the hope of continuing to limit maritime armaments and building forts in the Pacific will become increasingly distant. The rumors about the Ogasawara Islands should be explained to dispel the concerns that naturally arise. (19th Reuters Electric)</p>

<p>Eleven Army Defendants Pleased with Their Confessions</p>
<p>Proletarian Party Points to Legal Injustice</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The eleven army murderers in the May 15th Incident, including Eihan Goto, were sentenced at the military court of the 1st Division in Aoyama at 10 a.m. today. Since August 18, when Prosecutor Koizaka sought an eight-year prison sentence for each defendant, fascist factions have been vigorously launching nationwide campaigns to save lives and reduce sentences. According to official statements, 300,000 petitions for sentence reduction have been received. This morning, before the sentencing, various fascist groups were very nervous and might riot if they were dissatisfied. The military police were on high alert. At 10 a.m., Chief Judge Nishimura announced the opening of the court. Only twenty people were allowed to attend. Legal officer Shimada, judges Hirakawa, Yokota, Kawashima, and Tani, and lawyers Hosomi, Okuma, Nakamura, Nakagawa, Hiramatsu, Kakuoka, Yamada, and Kuwabara took their seats. After Chief Judge Nishimura called the roll, he stood up and announced the sentences of each defendant and the reasons for the sentences. The court was adjourned at 10:50 a.m. The sentences were: infantry 45th Regiment officer candidate Eihan Goto (25 years old), field heavy artillery 4th Regiment officer candidate Nakaaki Nakajima (25 years old), aviation 4th officer candidate Ichinosuke Fujiwara (24 years old), aviation 6th Regiment officer candidate Haruo Yagi (24 years old), infantry 73rd Regiment officer candidate Sakae Ishiseki (24 years old), infantry 77th Regiment officer candidate Yutaka Kaneseki (24 years old), infantry 31st Regiment officer candidate Saburo Nomura (23 years old), infantry 79th Regiment officer candidate Taketoshi Nishikawa (23 years old), aviation 6th Regiment officer candidate Tsutomu Suga (23 years old), field artillery 1st Regiment officer candidate Masami Yoshihara (23 years old), infantry 75th Regiment officer candidate Kaneichi Sakamoto (23 years old), each sentenced to four years in prison, deducting 150 days of pre-trial detention. It is heard that the defendants are all satisfied and have decided not to appeal. (19th Hua Lian She Electric)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The eleven murderers in the Army May 15th Incident, including Eihan Goto, were sentenced today to four years in prison, deducting 150 days of pre-trial detention, meaning only a little over three years of actual imprisonment. Such a shocking and earth-shattering riot was settled with just over three years of imprisonment, mainly because the real power of the current government is held by the army. The murderers are satisfied, and although the fascist factions are outwardly strongly advocating innocence, they are actually quite satisfied. The Proletarian Party advocates injustice, comparing it to workers' group movements. Both are Japanese citizens, but the legal punishment they receive differs greatly. (19th Hua Lian Electric)</p>

<p>Chief Judge Nishimura read the judgment reasoning. The main points are excerpted below: (It is found that the defendants are all students of the Army Officer School, receiving school education and cultivating the spirit of soldiers. They must have understood the true essence of the Imperial Way and the dignity of the national polity. In the event of a crisis, they should gladly sacrifice themselves. This belief, we know, has been consolidated. However, the defendants entered and exited Lieutenant Suganami's door, listened to his discussions on the Emperor's view and the national polity, and exchanged opinions with each other. Based on the spirit of national construction, they wanted to reform current malpractices, deeply felt the need to establish an imperial Japan, sacrifice for the country, and take direct action to realize the reform of the country. (Describing the relationship with the Navy and the situation at the time of the crime) According to the law, the defendants formed a party to rebel and engaged in practical work, which should be punished in accordance with Article 25, Paragraph 2 of the Army Criminal Law. However, although the cause, motives, and purpose of the crime are understandable, the act of disrupting military discipline is serious. Therefore, the defendants are sentenced to imprisonment for four years, and 150 days of pre-trial detention will be deducted from the imprisonment period. Let each be informed.

<p>(Hong Kong) Guangdong implemented the foreign rice tax on the 18th, and the price of rice skyrocketed by 10-20%. The Guangdong Rice Bran Merchants Association sent Lu Weidong to visit District Fangpu, the Finance Director on the 18th, requesting the abolition of the foreign rice tax to maintain the people's food supply. District replied that the dumping of foreign rice has caused the price of local rice to fall. If no measures are taken to maintain it, the rural economy will go bankrupt. Therefore, the foreign rice tax is to maintain domestic food and cannot be stopped. However, quantitative or ad valorem taxation can be improved appropriately. The Rice Bran Association decided to hold another meeting on the evening of the 20th to discuss countermeasures. On the 17th and 18th, Hong Kong rice merchants sent telegrams to the Guangdong authorities, requesting the cancellation of the foreign rice tax to relieve the people's suffering.

<p>Cotton Industry Unanimously Requests Currency Inflation</p>
<p>Roosevelt Signs New Mining Industry Regulations</p>
<p>Reuters Dispatch from Washington, 18th: President Roosevelt today allocated another $150 million from the Treasury for the Financial Reconstruction Corporation to expand lending procedures, due to Southern congressmen advocating a straightforward inflation of cotton prices. Bank operations are currently restricted by a large number of cotton documents. In the future, new government funds will be used to assist them. Financial Reconstruction Corporation Chairman Jones announced the new plan. The currency inflation movement has gained the greatest momentum since Congress authorized the President to issue new currency or devalue the dollar. People in the cotton industry and key figures in the Southern parties met here, making currency inflation one of President Roosevelt's biggest problems. Oklahoma Senator Thomas recently notified Congress, asking it to express its views on inflation. He has received a hundred replies, with only four opposing inflation. Thomas now says he will convene a meeting to elect a committee to convey Congress's views on inflation to the President. All cotton-producing states will participate in this meeting.</p>
<p>Reuters Dispatch from Washington, 18th: The American Cotton Industry Conference today unanimously passed a resolution requesting President Roosevelt to use his power to implement currency inflation in order to raise the price of cotton to two cents per pound and cottonseed to thirty dollars per ton.</p>
<p>Reuters Dispatch from Washington, 18th: After obtaining the consent of all parties in the coal industry, President Roosevelt signed the coal mining industry regulations at the White House today. The President is currently suffering from a cold and has not left the White House. The industry regulations stipulate a 40-hour work week for bituminous coal mining and set minimum wages for skilled and unskilled workers. They also stipulate that sales prices will be negotiated by the coal industry under the supervision of the National Recovery Administration. The industry regulations also provide for the establishment of a mechanism for public arbitration of labor disputes. President Roosevelt deleted the clauses relating to labor rights because labor leaders opposed them. The industry regulations will be implemented in October. At the same time, no less than 19 labor disputes have been resolved under the supervision of the National Recovery Act in the past three weeks, involving a total of 400 businesses. President Roosevelt revised the coal mining industry regulations so that he could appoint his own committee to monitor the behavior of the bituminous coal industry. This new industry regulation involves 95% of the American bituminous coal industry and approximately 400,000 miners.</p>

<p>Receiving Strong Support from Student Factions</p>
<p>General Election Scheduled for Next Spring</p>
<p>Havana - The opposition party, during a meeting with President San Martin's government, presented President San Martin with an ultimatum, demanding his resignation to form a cabinet composed of representatives from all parties. San Martin replied, "I must wait for a qualified body to request my resignation before I can resign. In short, as long as the revolutionary agenda is implemented, who is president is not of much importance." Students leaning towards the revolutionary faction expressed their stance, saying, "San Martin cannot resign; at the very least, we should ask him not to resign, as his presidential authority was granted by us." It is widely believed that if San Martin allows himself to resign, the students will decide to retaliate against him, as they would view San Martin's resignation as a betrayal of the revolution. As for the soldiers, they are also gradually feeling deceived, as the soldiers' mutiny aimed only at improving their material treatment, but now the scope has expanded, and they are being implicated.

<p>Havana - Tonight, the Cuban cabinet resolved to hold a general election on April 1st of next year. Simultaneously, representatives for a constitutional convention will be elected, and the constitutional convention will be convened on May 20th to revise the new constitution.</p>
<p>Cuban politics are showing a clear trend towards radicalism. Although the government denies this, according to reliable American sources, in many places within the country, students and soldiers are not only attempting to exercise political affairs but also seeking to manage factories and the sugar industry. This news comes from provinces such as Sancti Spiritus and Camagüey. It is also reported that students and strikers in the town of Mayabeque have established a Soviet government and taken over sugar mills. However, a government spokesman said that this claim is highly doubtful. Cabinet members are currently drafting financial plans. President Grau San Martin promises to consolidate finances and stabilize the economy as soon as possible, adding that if there is no interference, the government can immediately restore industry and work throughout the island. The opposition party has not made any statements today. Several sources believe that the opposition leaders have agreed to temporary cooperation. In Havana, the number of workers returning to work is increasing daily. In Pinar del Río province, where a rebellion occurred last week, peace and tranquility are also reported. However, the San Martin government is currently still unwilling to cooperate with the United States on all issues, seeking to force the United States into de facto recognition. The U.S. government wants American sugar companies and Cuban sugar producers to agree on the allocation of the American market as soon as possible. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has notified the Cuban government, stating that the U.S. government still maintains that the amount of sugar Cuba sells in the U.S. should be equivalent to that sold by American farmers. However, it seems that the Cuban sugar industry currently lacks a central figure who can take responsibility for negotiations. Therefore, all negotiations on quotas and export limits are temporarily suspended. (National Telegram, 17th)</p>
<h3 id="e94">German-Austrian Peace Terms <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Vienna, Havas, 19th - According to the "Neue Wiener Journal," Rosenberg, director of the foreign affairs office of the German National Socialist Party, has proposed the following conditions for "German-Austrian reconciliation" and the restoration of normal relations: (1) Austria should adopt the same diplomatic government as Germany. (2) Austria should support Germany in the League of Nations. (3) Austria should obtain Germany's consent before entering into economic agreements with other countries. (4) The policies pursued by Germany and Austria in Central Europe should be jointly determined by both countries. (5) The Austrian government should adopt an authoritative policy within the country that is compatible with German policies. Austrian newspapers should also cease anti-German propaganda. (6) The order prohibiting the Austrian National Socialist Party should be revoked. (7) Austrian National Socialists should be granted amnesty. (8) Austrian National Socialists who have been deprived of their citizenship should have their citizenship restored. (9) Austrian National Socialists who have fled to Germany and had their property confiscated should have it returned. (10) The Austrian government should prohibit all Marxist activities. (11) Germans who have fled into Austrian territory should be extradited. (12) Austria should emulate Germany in carrying out anti-Jewish movements and adopt "quota clauses" (i.e., the number of Jews in certain professions is subject to certain restrictions). (13) Austria should engage in close economic cooperation with Germany on a reciprocal basis. (14) The exit tax of one thousand marks levied on Germans entering German territory should be abolished. (15) Germany approves of Dollfuss as the Austrian Chancellor. (16) The Austrian Patriotic Front may continue to exist, but its political program should be revised. (17) Germany recognizes Austria's complete independence. The above conditions seem to have been given by Rosenberg to a key figure in the Austrian Farmers' Union, entrusted to him for delivery. After reviewing these conditions, this key figure seems to have presented a counter-proposal, accepting some of the conditions while rejecting others as interfering in Austrian internal affairs. It is also reported that German Foreign Minister Neurath declared that the conditions proposed by Rosenberg were not diplomatic and did not fully take into account the actual situation. He believed that the above conditions should be revised as follows: (1) Germany and Austria should cooperate sincerely in foreign policy and foreign trade. (2) Austrian domestic policy should adopt German policy to the extent that it does not overstep boundaries. (3) The solution to the Austrian National Socialist Party issue should be to detach the party from German influence. As for the Austrian Farmers' Union, it has issued a public statement rejecting the receipt of such proposals and refusing to discuss the above conditions. The statement also stated that the conditions proposed by Rosenberg are more difficult to accept today than in the past, which goes without saying.</p>

<p>The Reorganization Committee Sets Total Review</p>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence - After Yan Xishan assumed the post of Pacification Director of Jin and Sui, he determined that the economies of Jin and Sui provinces were bankrupt, their vitality was over-injured, and the various military and administrative expenses were insufficient to cover expenditures, resulting in a significant annual deficit. In particular, military spending was the largest drain. Therefore, he decided to reduce the army to make up for the shortfall. In the past year or so, it has already been reorganized twice. According to current statistics, the finances of the two provinces are still short 140,000 to 150,000 yuan per month. Yan and the military leaders negotiated and decided to implement a third reorganization. The general plan has been drafted. The Jin-Sui Military Reorganization Committee held a meeting the other day to decide on the review methods for the armies in the two provinces. The attendees included Acting Chairman Yang Aiyuan, committee members Sun Chu, Zhou Dai, Zhu Shuguang, Kong Fan, Zhang Hanjie, Xie Lian, Chu Xichun, Wu Cui, Li Fangchi, Xu Heting, Ma Entian, and Chi Mingtu. It is reported that the committee, in order to ensure consistent performance assessment of the various units, divided the review into groups according to subject matter and sent specialists to conduct a detailed review. The decided key items are as follows: (1) Review dates: infantry review to begin on October 15th, cavalry and artillery review to begin on November 1st. (2) Review subjects: divided into academic, technical (parade, technology, combat, training, marching, work implementation, night exercises), and internal affairs (recognition of subordinates, own duties, military discipline) three items.

<h3 id="e96">Henan Bandits Capture Luyi <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>County Magistrate Xu Xizhi Kidnapped by Bandits</p>
<p>Provincial Government Sends Troops to Rescue and Recapture</p>
<p>Kaifeng Correspondence - Henan Province is known throughout the country for its bandits. In recent years, the Communists have risen in Shangqiu and Hankou, and the so-called eight counties of the Special Zone have become their sphere of influence. Bandits in other counties are also extremely rampant, such as Wang You, Li Changyou in western Henan, Xiao Liushao, Gu Dashen in Nanyang, Yang Xiaohei in Runan, Cheng Daorong in Huaiyang, and Du Jing in northern Henan. The larger groups have over 10,000 men, while the smaller groups have 500 to 600. However, Du Jing's group only harasses the borders of Anyang, Linzhang, and Neihuang counties and does not dare to go far. Wang, Li, Xiao, Gu, Yang, and Cheng's groups sometimes combine and sometimes separate, roaming south of the Yellow River. They have been repeatedly pursued and suppressed by government troops, but have never been eliminated. In the past three months, Xiao, Gu, Yang, Cheng's groups have mixed together, causing harm in the Runan and Xincai areas. Liu Zhi personally supervised the suppression once, and then commissioned the 52nd Division, the 1st Cavalry Brigade, the 13th Cavalry Brigade, and the Security Detachment Commander Cheng Ziyi's troops to be specifically responsible for the encirclement and suppression. After repeated attacks by the various units, the bandits dispersed and fled. Yang Xiaohei, Cheng Daorong, Huo Guodong, and other groups numbering several thousand, who were disturbing Huaiyang and Shenqiu, were relatively strong. On the 12th, they fled from the border of Huaiyang and Shenqiu counties and attempted to attack the county town of Luyi. At that time, the newly appointed County Magistrate Xu Xizhi sent two security teams to intercept them in different directions. However, due to the small number of soldiers and the large number of bandits, that night the bandits suddenly turned from the west to the south and directly approached the county town. At that time, there was only one security company stationed in the city, and the military strength was isolated and difficult to defend. However, Xu had served as the chief of the staff section of the headquarters of the three provinces for a long time and had considerable combat experience. He resolutely led a small number of troops to defend the county town of about nine li, braving arrows and charging, for a whole night. The next day, (13th) in the morning, the bandits used ladders to climb directly up the south gate in an attempt to seize the pass. At that time, Xu's troops, although their ammunition was exhausted, continued with knives and ordered the third section chief of the county government, Zou Jianbai, to direct the defense at the west gate. The bandits were repelled several times. Later, the bandits, unable to succeed, set fires on all sides and launched a fierce attack, and the west gate of the county was first captured at Yinke (3-5 AM) that morning. Xu was also kidnapped while leading his troops in street fighting. The former County Magistrate Zhong Shiming, who was staying in the county because his handover had not been completed, also fled in panic that day and disappeared. Trial Officers Wang Hanguang and Wang Shiying fled for their lives. Wang Hanguang was anxious and timid and fell off the city wall and was injured. He has now been moved to Haozhou for treatment. Wang Shiying hid in the city and was fortunate to escape harm. Zou Jianbai, the third section chief of the county government, rushed to Haozhou for help and sent telegrams appealing for assistance. Upon receiving the report, the provincial government sent the 14th Cavalry Brigade and the 2nd Security Regiment, and the 5th Company of the 7th District Security, to rush to assist in the suppression at night. The bandits, hearing the news, kidnapped County Magistrate Xu Xizhi on the morning of the 14th and fled far to the northeast. (At the moment, Zhen Jiyin, the commissioner of the 7th District, has personally gone to the county to handle the aftermath. Trial Officer Wang Shiying, who was hiding in the county town, has been pushed as the temporary county magistrate to maintain the status quo. The provincial government has ordered Zou Jianbai, the third section chief of the county, to return to the city immediately to temporarily serve as the county magistrate. The gist of the letter from the section chief to the provincial government is attached below (Cheng and Yang's bandit gangs, after being severely suppressed by Commander Cheng Ziyi, fled in two groups to disturb Huaiyang, Shenqiu, and other counties. The group that fled to Shenqiu repeatedly harassed Baimayi in Luyi County. County Magistrate Xu sent two security teams to intercept them several times. The bandits, unable to succeed in their attack, set fires everywhere and took the opportunity to seize the pass. Due to the disparity in numbers, the west gate was first captured at Yinke (3-5 AM) on the 13th. County Magistrate Xu was captured while leading his troops in street fighting. On the 14th, the bandits withdrew, and the county magistrate's life and death are unknown). (16th)</p>
<h3 id="e97">Bandit Atmosphere Still Rampant in Northern Anhui <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Fuyang County Once in Danger</p>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence - Cheng Yaode's defeated troops from Henan Province previously fled into Fuyang in northern Anhui and mixed with the accumulated bandits Zhang Xueliang, Fan Ba, Jiang Ma, Lang Zepu, Huo Laohu (Guodong), and other gangs. They were numerous and harassed everywhere, burning, killing, raping, and plundering, extremely cruel. Later, the 3rd Army Commander Wang Jun supervised his troops and the Henan-Anhui armies to launch a large-scale joint suppression, which dispersed the bandit gangs. The remnant bandits fled to the territory of Taihe County, and were pursued by government troops, turning east and attempting to harass Wo and Meng. Just as they arrived at the Wo River, they were again met with a head-on attack by government troops and local militias. The bandits fled back to the west and lingered in the Shuangmiaoji and Cihepu areas at the junction of Fuyang and Taihe. Cheng Ziyi's Security Detachment from Henan Province, the 1st Regiment of the Anhui Provincial Security Team led by Zu Xinzai, and the 2nd Regiment led by Ni Rongxian, separately suppressed them. 3rd Army Commander Wang Jun then returned to Bengbu and stationed there. When Cheng Yaode and other bandit gangs were lingering in Cihepu and Shuangmiaoji, Cheng Ziyi led three regiments to suppress them. The bandits stubbornly resisted, engaging in fierce hand-to-hand combat for a day and a night. Both sides suffered casualties. The bandits finally could not hold out and fled west. When the bandits fled to about four or five li west of Fuyang City, they showed signs of attacking the city. The city gates were tightly closed, and the county town was in danger. The residents were extremely panicked. Fortunately, the local militia blocked them, and government troops arrived in pursuit. The bandits then fled through Baimiaoji to the Tianpengji area. Fuyang City was spared. However, the residents had already suffered a great fright. The city gates were only opened on the 14th. The bandits Xiao, Gu, Li Xiuling, and other gangs, who had disturbed Songji in the 7th district of Fuyang, were surrounded by Peng Yu's two cavalry brigades on three sides. The bandits desperately resisted and broke through the encirclement in the middle of the night, fleeing to Shenqiuji (120 li from Fuyang). Government troops are currently in pursuit. It is reported that there are more than 3,000 bandits with 2,000 guns. According to visitors from Shouxian, the notorious bandit Zhang Dabizi's gang in northern Anhui, after capturing Hanshan County and plundering it, fled to the Zhujiawan and Zhangjiaqiao areas at the junction of Shou and Dingyuan, burning, killing, raping, and plundering, and were extremely brutal. Everywhere they passed, all houses were empty. The county's security team has joined forces with the 2nd and 3rd district teams of Dingyuan to encircle and suppress the bandits. Jiang Yi, the chief of the Changhuai River Water Police Bureau, had previously returned to Bengbu by ship with his team because the bandit situation in the Fuyang and Ying areas had dispersed. However, the bandits returned, and Fuyang was in a tight spot. Only staying in Bengbu and Suzhou, he returned to the Fuyang and Ying areas to defend. (September 18th)</p>
<h3 id="e98">Shanghai Group Representatives Present Banner to Su Bingwen <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Held in Suzhou</p>
<p>Suzhou Correspondence - Representatives of various groups in Shanghai, Ye Jiaxing, Wang Honghui, Sun Mingqi, etc., held a banner presentation ceremony to General Su Bingwen at the Garden Hotel. The situation was tragic and is recorded in detail as follows:</p>
<p>The meeting opened at 11:30 a.m. on the 19th. Attendees included representatives from all walks of life: the county government, the Public Security Bureau, the Education Bureau, the Third District Administrative Inspectorate, the Party Headquarters, the Farmers' Association, the High Court, the Reformatory, and local figures Zhang Yunbo, Fei Zhongshen, and Yang Yongqing, president of Soochow University. Wang Honghui, Ye Jiaxing, and Sun Mingqi were publicly elected as the presidium. After the music played and the meeting began, Ye Jiaxing first reported on the significance of the banner presentation. Amid applause, the embroidered banner with the four characters "Anti-Japanese Hero" was presented to Mr. Su. Next, gold medals were presented. There were four other gold medals, which were presented to Zhang Dianjiu, Gao Junling, Wu Delin, and Wang Erzhan, and accepted on their behalf by Mr. Su's entourage. Next, Mr. Su delivered a thank-you speech, roughly saying that at the time of resisting the stubborn enemy, he had intended to destroy the puppet organization, but as a result, he ran out of ammunition and food, was deeply oppressed by the enemy army, and retreated to the Russian border, failing to recover the lost territory. He was deeply ashamed. Now, he only had his original intention, continued to work hard, and prepared to use his life to fight the enemy in the future. Next, Zhang Yunbo gave a speech, roughly saying that the Chinese people are now like people who have swallowed sleeping pills, sleeping for 733 days. Although they have awareness in their hearts, because they are bound, they have very little action. Only a few people can show admirable behavior. Such people are indeed heroes, but national affairs cannot be supported by a few heroes. He hoped that everyone would stand up and help this hero save the country, otherwise it would be difficult to support him alone, and it would be a pity to bury this hero. Next, Yang Yongqing, the president of Soochow University, gave a speech, roughly divided into three points: (1) Gold medals and flags are good, but they do not have the permanent admiration of all human beings in the world. The admiration of human beings is better than flags. (2) This time, the compatriots in Shanghai came to Suzhou to present the flag, seemingly representing the people of Suzhou, because the people of Suzhou also have this intention. The so-called worship of heroes, for all ages, is the same in heart. (3) From now on, we should think about how we can be worthy of national heroes. Next, Zhu Jiaji, a standing committee member of the Party Headquarters, gave a speech, roughly saying that there is more than one way to resist Japan, indirect and direct, with different means, such as merchants resisting goods, academic circles promoting, etc. Therefore, we should all take on the responsibility of resisting Japan and saving the country. Finally, a representative from the High Court gave a speech, wishing General Su victory after receiving the banner, and that the gold medal would make China golden and brilliant. Then, a group photo was taken and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Songjiang Hit by Hurricane <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>The Loss of Property</p>
<p>Yesterday (18th) it rained at dawn. At 2 p.m., a hurricane suddenly struck, more violent than last month. Waterway traffic was temporarily suspended. The tide rose sharply, almost level with the shore. Countless thatched houses and car sheds in the suburbs were blown over. Telephone lines were disrupted, hindering communication. Electric lights flickered, all of which were beyond human control. Late rice is the main agricultural product of this county. It is now the flowering season for late rice. After a day and night of hurricane ravaging, there is no hope for a bumper harvest this year. The loss is incalculable. Old farmers, who work hard all year round, were saddened by this setback. The hurricane stopped at about 1 p.m. today (19th).</p>

<p>After the production of the 4th Executive and Supervisory Committee members, the original plan was to take over on the 15th. At that time, no supervising member appointed by the provincial ministry arrived in Songjiang, and we waited quietly for the provincial order. It has been learned that the new Executive and Supervisory Committee members have been approved by the 37th meeting of the Provincial Executive Committee and instructed the chairman of the 4th Executive and Supervisory Committee, Wang Zhewu, to conduct the takeover and report it. The date of the takeover will be discussed at the discussion meeting.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Suzhou - Liu Jingdu Commits Suicide Out of Disgust with the World <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>On the 19th of the Inter-Railway Hotel, a traveler committed suicide, leaving a suicide note. The guest wrote his name as Liu Jingdu, about 30 years old. He arrived in Suzhou from Beijing on the 18th, wearing a serge Chinese suit with the clothes inside out, with the character "Cheng" on them. This morning (19th), he was found to have taken poison and was immediately sent to Suyong Hospital, but he died before he could be treated. The suicide note was very long and spoke of national affairs. The main points were: (1) The 918 anniversary has been two weeks, and I don't know how many slogans have been changed, and I don't know how many meetings have been held, but not an inch of lost land has been recovered, and the Japanese army is now threatening Zhangjiakou again. The people of Yuguan are following the pseudo-Manchuria. In this situation, what hope is there other than national subjugation? (2) The big shots are always one step behind. When France occupied the Nine Islands, we slowly investigated after they declared it, and then protested. (3) The Japanese army has built a great garrison in Shanghai, but I have not heard of any expression from the government. (4) Apart from the written publicity in the news media and the patterned commemorative meetings of the Party Headquarters, what other expressions are there in Beijing, Shanghai, and Suzhou for the 918 national humiliation? The people have long forgotten the pain of the loss of the Northeast. Today (probably referring to the 18th), apart from the old sky still crying, the air is as silent as if it were dead. (5) I am a weak person, and my death is not a pity, but my death cannot rest in peace, that is, when will the Japanese slaves be rampant, and then can I go to kill them in Fusang? This kind of evil society is showing signs of national subjugation everywhere. There are no Japanese goods anywhere, sad, sad. The first hatred is for corrupt officials who prey on the people. If I have knowledge underground, I will definitely become a fierce ghost and kill them, to relieve my accumulated hatred. (6) The rural economy in the country is bankrupt, and we still have to bring in a lot of cotton and wheat from foreign countries to compete with the farmers in the market. The Supervisory Yuan is equal to a dummy. (7) Which province does not have bandits, Hubei, Jiangxi, Hunan, Sichuan, Anhui? The government troops have fought for four or five years, and it is still like this. I am unwilling to be a subjugated slave, so I commit suicide, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Wuxi - The Rice Industry Discount Dispute Resolved <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>The rice and bean industry discount dispute, which has been going on for several months, was mediated by the Suzhou rice tycoon, Mr. Zhou Hongqing. However, due to the insistence of both parties, the mediation once broke down. Therefore, Mr. Zhou expressed dissatisfaction with both parties. Zhao Zixin, the chairman of the local rice industry association, even expressed his resignation. Public sentiment generally blamed the Sanliqiao segment, while the six dissenting firms, seeing the situation was not good, resolutely sought peace. There are two reasons: (1) If they oppose to the end, they will become the target of public criticism from their peers, and there will be no way to clean up the situation. (2) Although they have been advocating a 9.9 discount for several months, their business has not increased. Moreover, it is now the season for new grains to be harvested, and if they do not resolve the issue as soon as possible, it will certainly affect their own vital interests. Therefore, representatives of both parties gathered at the Longmao Rice Store yesterday to make a final mediation. Mr. Zhou announced the mediation method, deciding to implement the new 9.84 discount system together from October 1st. Both parties expressed their approval. Once the county chamber of commerce approves it, the entire matter can be resolved.</p>

<p>The New World Hotel, under the Gongyun Bridge in the county, recently received Shao, a traveler from Yixing, and his wife, Xu Shuyuan. Shao worked as a recorder in the Shanghai Special District Court. This time, he was going to Shanghai after his honeymoon, and Xu Shuyuan, feeling deeply attached, sent him off to Wuxi. They talked long into the night and did not sleep until the east turned white and the rooster crowed. Shao hurriedly bid farewell to his wife and took the train to Shanghai. Shuyuan, having not closed her eyes all night, fell into a hazy sleep. Suddenly, a teahouse attendant, Gai Xinggen, opened the door and entered, kneeling on both knees before Shuyuan, begging for pleasure. Shuyuan was startled and shouted. The teahouse attendant then fled out of the room. Later, Shuyuan called her husband's younger brother, Shao Xiaobao, a staff member of the experimental department of the Provincial Education Institute at the Sheqiaotou, who arrived and dragged the accountant Liu Zhiqing, Xu Zhisheng, and the teahouse attendant Gai Xinggen to the Public Security Second Sub-bureau, who transferred them to the County Public Security Bureau. The Third Section interrogated them and sentenced the teahouse attendant to seven days of detention for his improper behavior, as a warning. Liu Zhiqing and others were ordered to return together. However, the plaintiff will formally file a lawsuit in court based on the crime of attempted rape under the Criminal Law and request the Public Security Bureau to explain the legal basis for sentencing attempted rape to only seven days of detention, in order to maintain law and order.</p>

<p>Yongtaichang Silk Firm, located in Lijiabridge Town, Wuyi County, recently hired Yuan Huaimin from Wuxi to purchase autumn cocoons. Gu Jizhen, a 17-year-old woman from the town, possessed remarkable beauty, and Yuan repeatedly harbored lascivious intentions towards her. Gu persistently rejected his advances. On the 17th, Jizhen traveled by boat to visit relatives in the city. Yuan followed her to the city. That afternoon, Jizhen intended to return to the town on the same boat, but Yuan followed her onto the boat and forcibly made her disembark. He suggested that he accompany her to visit his girlfriend, Cao Fenghuan, in Dasuo Lane. Jizhen, unable to shake him off, hired a carriage to Dasuo Lane. By the time she returned to the pier, the boat had already departed. At this point, Yuan deployed his seductive tactics and coerced her into going to the Large Guesthouse in the western suburbs, booking room number 15. He prevented her from leaving. That night, he forcibly raped her. The next morning, Jizhen's grandmother, Madam Yin, arrived in the city, searching for her granddaughter in vain. She enlisted the help of others to search everywhere. Eventually, they found her at the guesthouse in the western suburbs, where Jizhen was weeping bitterly in bed. Upon inquiring about the situation, Jizhen recounted the entire ordeal. Yuan, however, had already left early in the morning. Madam Yin, filled with uncontrollable rage, enlisted others to track down Yuan. They apprehended him in front of the County Government. On the afternoon of the 18th, he was escorted to the County Court Prosecutor's Office. Prosecutor Guan Junjie conducted the interrogation, during which Yuan recounted the details of the incident. Prosecutor Guan determined that Yuan Huaimin had intentionally seduced a young woman and forcibly raped her, which was truly detestable. He ordered that Yuan be shackled and imprisoned, pending prosecution under the law.</p>

<p>Xin Yongshun Flower Firm in Jiuqu Town, under the jurisdiction of the county, sent an apprentice named Xiao Bingsheng on the 17th by bicycle to Shenxin Flower Store in Fuqiao Town to collect 1,000 yuan in funds. The apprentice took the receipt to collect the money. After counting the banknotes, he wrapped them in paper and placed them in his short shirt pocket, then rode the bicycle back to the firm. Unexpectedly, along the way, due to the violent vibrations of the bicycle, the banknotes fell out of his pocket onto the road. An elderly woman found them and, upon inspecting the package, saw that it contained a large amount of money. She sat by the roadside, waiting for the owner to claim them. When the apprentice arrived at the firm and attempted to hand over the money to the owner, he found his pocket empty. He was immediately shocked and frantic. He rushed back along the same route in search of the money. Along the way, the elderly woman saw his distressed state and asked him what was wrong. The apprentice told her the truth. The elderly woman returned all the banknotes to him without missing a single one. Such an elderly woman is truly worthy of admiration!</p>

<p>Quan Qixin, the young owner of Xinji Bookstore in the county town, was by nature timid and kind. He diligently managed the store every day, never straying far. However, due to the declining business, he faced extreme economic pressure. After much deliberation, he decided to seek a way out elsewhere. In June of this year, he went to Zhenjiang to find work. Despite his efforts, he found no opportunities, and his pockets were empty. Driven to desperation and at wit's end, he secretly ingested sodium nitrite and took his own life. When Quan's family learned of this news, they were shocked and immediately rushed to Zhenjiang to bring his remains back to their hometown.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Kidnappers Resort to Cruel Torture After Failed Ransom Demand <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Shen Hesheng and his son Linsheng from Dayao Township in this county were kidnapped by the bandit leader Shitou Xiaodi, who demanded a ransom of 30,000 yuan, to be paid by a set date at the Hangzhou Railway Station. The Shen family, being of moderate means, could not afford such a large sum. As a result, they delayed the payment. Unexpectedly, the gang of bandits, believing that the Shen family had no intention of paying the ransom, subjected Shen Hesheng and his son, along with other kidnap victims from the Suzhou area, to cruel torture in the area north of Dingpeng and Beitangtan. They applied strips of cloth all over their backs, then coated them with raw lacquer. After the lacquer had partially dried, they ripped off one end of the cloth, tearing the skin with it, causing excruciating pain. Their agonizing cries for help were unbearable to hear. Residents in the area witnessed this and, feeling deeply sorry for them, reported the horrific scene to the Shen family, urging them to pay the ransom immediately, or else they feared that the victims would not survive. The cruelty of the bandits' methods is truly shocking.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Hangzhou: Two Bandits Executed by Firing Squad by the Court <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Qi Xiaoseng, also known as Qi Changde, a native of Henan, residing in Caotang, Pingyao County, Hangzhou, was a notorious bandit with a long history of crimes. He had repeatedly evaded capture. On November 4th of last year, he and eight other bandits, including the Huzhou bandit leader Hu Qiufa, carrying firearms, went to Hechitou at around 9 PM and kidnapped Ruan Jinfang and others. Ruan Jinfang's family immediately reported the incident to the local militia police, who launched a search. The local standing militia encountered the bandits in Huawan Tumen and exchanged fire. During the battle, Qi Xiaoseng was shot in the upper right ribs, and Hu Qiufa was shot in the right leg. Militia soldier Wang Xiandu was also injured. Ruan Jinfang, the kidnapped victim, took the opportunity to flee and escape unharmed during the fighting. The wounded bandits, Qi Xiaoseng and Hu Qiufa, were taken by their accomplices to Xujiacun and hidden in the home of Zhang the Monk. The next day, the militia police followed the trail of blood to Zhang the Monk's house and arrested Qi Xiaoseng and Hu Chunfa. They were escorted to the Provincial Garrison Headquarters and then transferred to the Court Prosecutor's Office. After investigation, the prosecutor determined that Qi Xiaoseng and Hu Qiufa were guilty of violating Article 1, Section 1 of the Provisional Regulations for the Punishment of Bandits. He filed a public prosecution and requested approval from the Provincial Government. The Provincial Government approved the execution by firing squad. At 8 AM yesterday morning, they were taken from the detention center, their identities were verified, and they were escorted outside Qingbo Gate for execution by firing squad.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Letter to the Editor <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>To the esteemed Editor:</p>
<p>On the 18th of this month, your newspaper's Suzhou local news column published a report concerning an accusation. We have investigated that, in July, the report of a Liuhe anti-smuggling officer named Wang Fengzhang, et al., crossing the border to arrest people and disrupting public order, prompted our office to issue orders for their apprehension. In August, on multiple days, Wang Fengzhang, et al., again, in civilian clothes and armed, crossed the border at night to arbitrarily harass people, causing merchants and residents to flee in alarm and nearly causing an incident. Consequently, the Public Security Sub-Bureau's police team took Wang Fengzhang, et al., into custody and brought them in for questioning. Subsequently, a formal letter was received from the Jiangsu Provincial Narcotics Suppression Bureau, stating that the officer's rash actions were inappropriate. The bureau issued an order to its sub-bureau to reprimand the officer and authorized the bureau to send personnel to take him back for handling. Wang Fengzhang, however, showed no remorse and acted unlawfully. In addition to submitting a report to the province for strict investigation, we request that your publication make a correction. Thank you for your attention.</p>
<p>Kunshan County Government, September 19th.</p>

<h3 id="e110">Typhoon Passed Shanghai Yesterday; Taibao Songjiang Seawall in Danger Yesterday Morning <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Officials and Merchants Telegraph Requests for Funds for Emergency Repairs</p>
<p>Various Areas Severely Affected by Typhoon, Suffering Losses</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Weather Cleared, but Shipping Remains Obstructed</p>
<p>Another Typhoon Fortunately Dissipated</p>
<p>The second typhoon passed Dajishan in the early hours of yesterday morning, moving towards the southwest corner of Korea. When it passed Shanghai, the tides surged dramatically, disrupting transportation and causing vegetable prices to skyrocket. The Baoshan seawall was severely battered by the waves, collapsing in five places, totaling over 200 zhang in length. The seawall repair projects in Wusong Wumufeng and other locations were completely washed away by the waves, with several sections of the earthen dam collapsing. Many cotton and rice fields were flooded. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Baoshan County Government telegraphed the Municipal and Provincial Governments, requesting funds for emergency repairs. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e111">Yesterday's Observatory Report: Passed Dajishan Observatory <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>The Observatory reported that the typhoon struck the coast of Zhejiang on the afternoon of the previous day, heading north-northwest, threatening to make landfall in Wenzhou Bay and circle inland to strike Shanghai from behind. However, the direction changed in the evening, and at approximately 9 PM, it reached the sea east of Ningbo, moving north-north-east. By 2:30 AM yesterday morning, it had passed Dajishan, outside the mouth of Wusong, only 60-70 English miles from Shanghai. This was west of Huawushan, which the previous typhoon had passed. Although Shanghai was not hit by the center of the typhoon yesterday morning, it was affected by its periphery.</p>
<p>Moving towards Korea The Observatory issued its first report at 10 AM yesterday, stating that the air pressure in Korea and the Sea of Japan had increased. The typhoon scoured the East China Sea, passing east of Shanghai (i.e., Dajishan) at 2:30 AM yesterday, heading north-north-east. At 6 AM yesterday, it was at 32 degrees north latitude and 123 degrees east longitude (approximately 90 English miles northeast of Shanghai) in the ocean, with astonishingly strong winds. By 2 PM, it had reached 33 degrees north latitude and 124 degrees east longitude, moving north-north-east. This location is approximately 150 English miles northeast of Shanghai and is tilting further northeast, heading towards the southwest corner of the Korean Peninsula. As a result, the southwest coast of Korea is covered with storm clouds, and the tides in the Korean Strait will rise. The wind force along the coast of Zhejiang has decreased.</p>
<p>Liaison ship cut off Japan United News Agency, Shimonoseki, 19th telegram said: Shimonoseki and the Korean Strait area, on the 19th, were hit by a typhoon, with great force. At 6 AM, the wind speed was 12 meters. The Korean liaison ships that departed from the local area at 10:30 AM were all withdrawn midway. On the other hand, the ship sailing from Busan to Shimonoseki was also not seen. The contact between the two places was completely cut off.</p>
<p>Another Typhoon According to the Observatory's report, the second typhoon (referring to the typhoon that was proceeding due north at 23 degrees north latitude and 123 degrees east longitude southeast of Taiwan at 2 PM the previous day) was gradually dissipating after reaching southeast Taiwan from northern Luzon, due to the circulation and attraction of the first typhoon (referring to the one that passed Dajishan yesterday morning). Otherwise, at 6 AM yesterday morning, it would have reached approximately 120 English miles southeast of Wenzhou, at 27 degrees north latitude and 123 degrees east longitude, striking Shanghai again. A second disaster was fortunately avoided.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Damage to the Songjiang Seawall <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>A reporter from New Voice News Agency heard yesterday that many sections of the Wusong Baoshan seawall were in danger, so he took a car to investigate. He inspected the situation at the Hanchuan Pier, the Public Garden, Tanjiaham, Aomufeng (Lion Bridge), also known as Shitang, and the Baoshan Xuejiatan, Gujiadun, and Zhangjiazha areas. The details obtained are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e113">Waves on the Customs Wharf (Photo by Qichang) <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Wusong Road Starting from the northern section of Jungong Road, the paddy fields near the coast were completely flooded. North of Wuquan Road, the area around the Zhabei Power Plant (behind Shanghai University) was a vast expanse of water, turning into a swamp. The thatched huts built near the coast were half-submerged in water, and residents were frantically carrying items out of their homes and retrieving objects from the water. The terrain along the Zhanghuaham and Yunzaobang sections was particularly low, and the water had flooded the Songhu Railway tracks. Therefore, yesterday the Songhu train only ran to Zhanghuaham. In addition, along the road, more than ten trees and utility poles were broken by the wind.</p>
<p>Capsized Boats in Wusong After arriving at Wusong Town, the embankment along the Waimala Road was eroded by the tide, and the soil had collapsed. A utility pole had fallen there. After 1 AM yesterday morning, the streets of the town were also flooded by the rising tide, and the streets were filled with water. When the typhoon passed, the houses near the coast shook, and tiles flew everywhere. After 9 AM, the telephone and electric lights were cut off and extinguished due to the broken poles, plunging the area into darkness. On the river, one ship transporting pigs and one jellyfish boat were overturned by the wind and tide. The extent of the losses is still under investigation. Fortunately, the people on board were rescued, and no lives were lost.</p>
<p>Collapse of Stone Embankment As the reporter continued to inspect the various locations, he found that the sections north of Yunzaobang along the Huangpu River from Wusong were damaged, including Hanchuan Pier, the Public Garden, Tanjiaham, Yangmatou, and Wumufeng (Lion Bridge). The Hanchuan Pier was originally an earthen dam, and half of it had collapsed due to the tidal water, which then flooded into the area. Two-thirds of Tanjiaham was gone. Yangmatou is near the Wusong Fortified Island. The terrain there is low, and the water caused extensive damage when it rushed in. The Aquatic Products School and the Merchant Marine School were flooded, with water reaching a height of more than ten feet. By noon yesterday, the water had still not receded. The most dangerous area was Wumufeng, also known as the Stone Embankment, which winds its way to Baoshan and is ten li long. There are thirteen layers of stone steps from the bottom to the top. Eight of them have been washed away, five in Baoshan and one in Wusong. This embankment was built during the Qing Dynasty, nearly a hundred years ago, by Hu Renji, the magistrate of Baoshan County at the time, who used his personal fortune and donations to build it. It was built because there had been a major flood, and after the embankment collapsed, the water reached as far as Wuxi. Its significance was paramount, so Hu Renji, with foresight, spared no expense to complete it. To this day, the people of Baoshan and Wusong still praise his name. After the warning of the impending typhoon reached Wusong the day before yesterday, Tang Chengzhong, a member of the municipal committee of the district, immediately hired 75 workers to fill sacks with soil and carry out emergency repairs. The work began at 9 AM and continued until 4 PM. However, this temporary work was completely destroyed between midnight and 1 AM, when the northeast wind and the tide came together. Therefore, yesterday morning, Committee Member Tang again led 75 workers, and temporarily recruited nearby villagers, to carry out repairs again. North of Yunzaobang, including Qieluting (formerly Jiangtang) and Sections 22 and 25 of the district, the terrain in Yangjiaham and Zoujiaqiao of Qieluting is the lowest. In places where the water was one foot deep, those two locations experienced depths of four to five feet. Therefore, at the height of the storm yesterday morning, the water depth was over five feet. Half of the houses were submerged in water, and by 10 AM yesterday morning, it was still about three feet deep. Sections 22 and 25 consist of two earthen dams. They were severely damaged during the previous typhoon, and yesterday morning's damage was even worse.</p>
<p>Rice and Cotton Submerged The areas near the two sections are all farmland, so the cotton and rice in the fields were only visible above the water like seedlings, a vast expanse of water. The water will only recede after the weather clears for several days. According to farmers who were inspecting the damage in the fields, if the water recedes quickly, the cotton harvest will be reduced by 60 percent. Part of the rice fields have already been harvested, so the situation is slightly better. Overall, the most dangerous period was from midnight to 1 AM the night before last until 2 AM yesterday morning. From 1 AM to 3 AM, the wind force decreased slightly, and the tide gradually receded. Although the wind force was very strong and the tide surged as before yesterday morning after 8 AM, the wind had shifted to the northwest, which was not as severe as the day before.</p>
<p>Urgent Need for Repairs According to Tang Chengzhong, a member of the municipal committee of the district, if the embankments in the Wusong area had been repaired promptly after the previous incident, the damage this time would not have been so severe. He repeatedly requested assistance from the Public Works Bureau to carry out emergency repairs to avoid further danger. However, because the typhoon came so suddenly, the Public Works Bureau had not yet sent anyone to repair the damage when the danger became apparent. The citizens of Wusong are now most concerned about the high tides on the third day of the eighth lunar month and are in a state of anxiety. Therefore, they have requested the Municipal Government to instruct the Public Works Bureau to send workers and materials to Wusong to carry out repairs as soon as possible. Today, the Public Works Bureau sent Technician Gu to inspect the situation once in the morning.</p>
<p>Baotang Washed Away Near the city of Baoshan County, the water had gradually receded yesterday. The telephone was cut off at 7 PM the night before last and had not been restored by last night. The lights also went out once at 7 PM, then came back on, but went out again at 10 PM, and it will be difficult to restore them for a while. All the new embankment projects that were repaired with the 30,000 yuan allocated by the Provincial Government after the previous incident were completely washed away by the strong winds, rainstorms, and tides at around 1 AM yesterday morning. All previous efforts were wasted. More than half of the 27 zhang wooden stakes were washed away, and the 3 zhang head was also about to be breached. Yesterday, workers were ordered to throw stones to block the breach. Five to six feet of the old stone surface were washed away. The stone cave area was not seriously affected. The area north of Beijiantou near the county seat was the most severely affected. Therefore, yesterday, the county magistrate of Baoshan County, Jin Qingzhang, in addition to telegraphing the Provincial Government to send personnel to inspect the situation and urgently requesting funds for repairs, also convened a meeting of various groups such as the Chamber of Commerce at 1 PM in the afternoon to discuss emergency blocking measures.</p>
<p>Situation in Liuhe The embankments in Liuhe were washed away by the seawater during the typhoon and rainstorm the night before last in two places: (1) Beidaotang Temple, a total of nine zhang were washed away; (2) Five Houses, a total of five zhang were washed away. Several houses were destroyed. Yesterday, patrolman Zhu Huanong and workers went to inspect and carry out emergency repairs. The damage was not very serious.</p>
<p>Current Status of Repairs In Wusong, the Municipal Public Works Bureau sent Xue Baokang and workers to carry out repairs once at 1 AM the night before last. However, due to the strong winds, raging tides, and difficult working conditions, the work was stopped after only about an hour. Yesterday morning, the Public Works Bureau sent Technician Gu to inspect again. It was originally planned to carry out repairs immediately, but as of 2 PM, the workers had not yet arrived in Wusong, so only the workers hired by the Wusong Municipal Committee continued to carry out repairs.</p>

<p>During the hurricane and rainstorm, except for the Beijing-Shanghai Railway which was undamaged, the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, specifically the 414th freight train leaving Shanghai from the Zhakou station and traveling near Songjiang, experienced a severe event around 8 PM. The roofs of the freight cars numbered 1190 and 1214 were violently struck by the wind and rain, causing them to be blown off and scattered along the route. The incident was immediately reported by telegram to patrol workers and railway police along the line, who located the scattered debris. The damaged cars, after unloading their cargo at Shanghai Station at 9:30 PM, were sent to the Zhakou factory for repairs. Simultaneously, the telephone at the Rihuigang Station was damaged and short-circuited due to the storm, burning the telephone lines. Telephones at the South Station and the Xinlonghua Telephone Bureau were also disrupted by the storm. Fortunately, the telegraph and long-distance telephone lines throughout the network were undamaged and remained operational. However, between Songjiang and Shihudang along the Shanghai section, five or six telephone poles and roadside trees planted near the Shanghai stations were blown down, though the wires were not broken, allowing uninterrupted communication. The Railway Bureau has already dispatched workers to repair the damage.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Songhu Situation Yesterday - Due to the Zhanghuabang Railway Bridge on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway's Songhu branch line being submerged by floodwaters, trains yesterday could only run from the North Station to Zhanghuabang.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Ship Services Still Suspended Yesterday - Shanghai-Ningbo Still Suspended <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>The regular liners "New Beijing" and "New Ning Shao," which were canceled the day before due to the heavy wind, remained canceled yesterday even after the hurricane passed. Ning Shao Company initially planned to resume service with the "New Ning Shao," and sent personnel to Taikoo Company to inquire about the "New Beijing's" sailing status. After consultation, it was decided not to sail and instead resume scheduled services today. The Sanbei Company's "Ningxing" and China Merchants' "Xinming" were sheltering from the storm in Ningbo. Both companies sent telegrams to reschedule their arrival in Shanghai for today to avoid disrupting the schedule. Other Shanghai-Taiwan and Wenzhou liners were also delayed by one day each. China Merchants' "Jiahe" was sheltering from the storm outside Wusong and had not arrived, so its departure for Wenzhou was also postponed.</p>
<p>Post Shipments Postponed - The first-class British ship "Nardistan" was originally scheduled to leave yesterday, carrying 600 bales of Huzhou silk and over 4,000 chests of tea from Shanghai. Due to the heavy wind and rain the day before, the silk and tea could not be loaded without getting wet, forcing a one-day postponement. It is now scheduled to depart for England today. The Dollar Line's "President Cleveland," arriving in Shanghai from the United States, was originally scheduled to enter the port yesterday. However, it was struck by a hurricane 120 miles off the coast of Shanghai, forcing it to anchor outside Wusong for shelter. In the afternoon, the company received a telegram from the ship reporting no unexpected damage to the vessel, and it is scheduled to enter port at 8:30 AM today.</p>
<p>Three Ships Arrived Yesterday - Ships from Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, China Merchants, Nippon Yusen Kaisha, and others that were originally scheduled to arrive yesterday did not. But there were no messages of danger reported. Only two Yangtze River ships arrived in Shanghai yesterday: the China Merchants' "Jiang'an" and the Socony-Vacuum's "Meiping." The Dada's "Daiwa" also sailed to Shanghai from the Yangtze River, so they were safer. Only three Yangtze River ships departed; no ocean-going vessels sailed.</p>
<p>Rice Boats Capsized - During the violent hurricane and tidal surge the previous night, two rice boats, "Shen Zengfu" and "Wu Fuhai," anchored near Xuejiabang in Nanshi, were struck by the fierce winds and waves, snapping their mooring ropes. As a result, they could not be saved and capsized immediately. Fortunately, the two boats were close to a large sand barge, and the boat owners and their crews were rescued by the barge's crew, avoiding any casualties. However, the loss of the two boats was irreparable. The "Shen Zengfu" was loaded with 150 shi of low-quality rice for the Hengyiyuan Rice Store in Sijing, which was completely lost, estimated at over 1,000 yuan. The boat's planks and miscellaneous items were also worth 500 to 600 yuan. The "Wu Fuhai" was a self-selling boat, and although the rice was unloaded in time, it had already been loaded with engine oil and motors for various merchants in the interior, resulting in an estimated loss of around 1,000 yuan. The total loss for the two boats is estimated at around 4,000 yuan. While the hull of the "Shen Zengfu" boat remains, there is no trace of the "Wu Fuhai," causing the boat owners to weep uncontrollably. Japanese Ship Sends SOS - The Mitsui &amp; Co. freighter "Taiei Maru," which was loading cargo in Shanghai for Dalian, was struck by a hurricane outside the Wusong port at 2 AM yesterday. In addition to dropping anchor, the captain ordered the entire crew to do their best to resist the storm and sent a telegram for assistance. The Ministry of Communications' Coastal Wireless Station received the message at 2 AM yesterday and immediately notified Mitsui &amp; Co. At 3 AM, another telegram was received stating that the hurricane had passed, and the ship was safely out of danger and proceeding to Dalian as planned. Also, at 12:45 AM yesterday, the Coastal Wireless Station received an emergency call from the Japanese merchant ship "Hiknsth Maru," which encountered a hurricane at 31.27 degrees north latitude and 12.40 degrees east longitude. However, according to Mitsui &amp; Co., the ship is not owned by them.</p>
<p>Huangpu River Traffic - All Yangtze and ocean-going vessels of Jardine Matheson, Taikoo, China Merchants, and Ning Shao were suspended because the customs had previously sounded warning cannons. As for the ships still in operation, the company also sent telegrams to tell them to stop. All Huangpu River ferries were also suspended due to high winds and waves, which caused inconvenience for passengers traveling back and forth. The municipal ferries on Dongmen Road and Dongchang Road were extremely crowded, and the Municipal Bureau of Public Works temporarily added one additional ferry yesterday morning.</p>

<p>At 10:30 PM the previous night, the roof of Chu Fuqing's house on Tutang Street suddenly collapsed due to wind and rain, falling onto the roof of the east wing of the neighboring No. 5 Flour Industry Association. It collapsed instantly, injuring Xie Tangshi, a widow sleeping in the room, her young son Xie Yincai, and their housemate Mi Jinmei and Gao Ruiliang. The local First District Second Precinct sent police officers to rescue them. They were transported by car to Shanghai Hospital for treatment. Mi Jinmei suffered the most severe injuries to her head and waist. Xie Yincai and Gao Ruiliang both sustained minor head injuries and were kept in the hospital for observation. Also, the rear building of Lu Baosheng's house at No. 29, Lane 57, Sangyuan Street, outside Xiaonanmen in Nanshi, suddenly collapsed. Fortunately, no one was inside, and no one was injured. At around 9 PM, a short wall next to the kitchen of Dr. Hu Hongfang's house at No. 49, Xundao Street, inside Dadongmen, fell into the adjacent Tan Family Lane, but no one was injured. Over ten advertising boards belonging to the Public Works Bureau on the Republic Road were blown down by the wind.</p>
<p>Electrocution Deaths - Yesterday morning, around Xiaoximen, telephone lines and electricity lines crossed, causing a temporary communication outage. The Telephone Bureau received the report and dispatched craftsman Fei Jintao to repair it. Unexpectedly, the craftsman fell after being electrocuted. His skull was crushed by a stone, his brains splattered, and his limbs were severely injured. He was taken by police car to Shanghai Hospital for treatment, and then to Baolong Hospital. According to the doctors, his pulse was weak and erratic, and he was unconscious and still in critical condition. Without intervention, there was concern that he would not survive. Yesterday morning around 1 AM, Cao Baofu, a 49-year-old man from Taizhou, and his 14-year-old son Cao Xiaoyou, were sound asleep in their house on Guangfu Road in Caojiadu, west of Shanghai, when they were awakened by the sound of wind and rain. Suddenly, they heard a loud crash. The son ran out to investigate and was immediately electrocuted and fell to the ground when a broken power line fell. Cao Baofu saw his son injured and immediately jumped out to rescue him. However, he also stepped on the end of the wire and was severely electrocuted, immediately dying. His son was taken to the hospital for treatment and miraculously recovered. By yesterday afternoon, he had recovered and was sent home. The Sixth District was notified, and they ordered the local police to report to the court for inspection.</p>
<p>Broken Poles - During the second hurricane that struck Shanghai the previous night, the telephone lines of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications were severely damaged by the strong winds and rain, especially in Longhua and Zhenru. The three districts of Zhabei, Nanshi, and Pudong were less affected.</p>
<p>Two telephone poles were blown down in Wusong and workers were dispatched yesterday morning at 7 AM to repair them. The repairs were completed by yesterday afternoon. The lights in Wusong Town also went out the previous night because a telephone pole was broken by the wind. Also, the power lines in Nanshi, Pudong, and other places were cut by the storm the previous night, plunging several areas into darkness.</p>
<p>Vegetable Prices Soared - The prices of meat and vegetarian dishes in the city's markets, such as fish, shrimp, and other aquatic animals, all increased sharply because they were transported to Shanghai by small boats from other locations. Vegetables like cabbage, taro, edamame, pickled vegetables, and bean sprouts, though transported to the markets from nearby villages in Xujiahui, Jiangwan, and Dachang, were also carried by small boats from more distant villages. Due to the wind and rain the previous night, farmers were unable to harvest their crops. Although a small number of villagers braved the wind and rain to harvest and sell their produce at the markets, the supply was very limited. There was not enough to go around, and the produce quickly sold out. As a result, the vendors in the vegetable markets tripled their profits yesterday, and prices increased by three or four times compared to normal. Even those who offered high prices could not find produce. Salted fish and chicken and duck eggs, which were rarely purchased on normal days, were also impossible to find.</p>

<p>Impressions of the Tour of China - Extremely Good</p>
<p>Scheduled to Leave Shanghai for Hong Kong on the 27th to Return Home</p>
<p>To Return in a Year for a Longer Period of Study</p>
<p>Prince Carl of Sweden, accompanied by his friend Mr. Weibel, visited China for sightseeing. After touring Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places, he recently returned to Shanghai. Yesterday morning, our reporter interviewed Prince Carl at the Cathay Hotel. The Prince greeted him warmly, and Mr. Weibel also provided hospitality. The Prince, a tall and handsome young man in his twenties, was very polite. He said that he felt honored to visit China and meet with Chairman Lin of the National Government, Executive Yuan President Jiang Jingwei, Vice President Song Ziwen, and other important officials of the National Government. After visiting Beijing, he toured Tianjin, Qingdao, Jinan, and other places. He was very grateful for the warm hospitality of the local officials and people. The impressions he gained during this trip were extremely good and would never be forgotten. He arrived in Beijing on September 4th and went to Tianjin on the 9th for five days. He visited the Forbidden City, the Summer Palace, the library, and Coal Hill. He also climbed the Great Wall and overlooked the entire panorama. He deeply admired the cultural arts of China's long history, but he regretted that he did not have more time to stay. The reporter asked if he would take the opportunity to visit the West Lake in Hangzhou. The Prince smiled and replied that he would like to, but he had already booked a passage on the Changxing Company's Empress of Japan to Hong Kong on the 27th, and then on the Ruodon of the Swedish Post Steamship company, and then return home. If he had time during his short stay in Shanghai, he would definitely visit Hangzhou. After arriving in Hong Kong, he was afraid that he would not be able to visit Guangzhou due to time constraints, which he regretted. He plans to return to China in about a year, at which time he can fully explore and tour the country. He intended to stay in Beiping for at least two months, he stated. The reporter also asked about his impressions of Japan and his personal views on the China-Japan issue. He replied that he had spent about two months in Japan, traveling to famous cities and towns, and the scenery was very pleasant. As for other issues, he had only visited briefly and had not had time for detailed study and research, so he was unable to answer. He was also asked if he planned to visit the Northeast provinces on his next trip to China, where Japan has violently occupied for two years and the 30 million residents are purely Chinese. He said that this had already created a Balkan situation in the Far East, with crises everywhere and ready to erupt. The Prince thought for a moment, paid close attention, and replied that he would like to visit if he had the opportunity. At that time, the Prince was scheduled to visit various factories, so the reporter took his leave.</p>

<p>Mayor Wu Temporarily Assumes Command of the Songhu Garrison</p>
<p>To Take Over Upon Receiving Orders</p>
<p>No Personnel Changes in the Police Department</p>
<p>After Songhu Garrison Commander Dai Ji was ordered to serve as a member of the Fujian Provincial Government and concurrently as the Director of Civil Affairs, he took time to travel north. During this period, the post of garrison commander was temporarily held by Chief of Staff Zhang Xiang. The central government has already determined the official successor, but it has not been announced due to certain reasons. Considering that the Songhu defense is quite important, the position of garrison commander should not be vacant for too long. Yesterday, the Executive Yuan's meeting resolved to appoint Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng to temporarily serve as commander of the Songhu Garrison. Mayor Wu will take over after receiving the order, and Chief of Staff Zhang will handle the handover on the garrison side. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e120">To Take Over Upon Arrival of the Order in Shanghai <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Executive Yuan convened its 126th meeting and passed the appointment of Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng to temporarily serve as Commander of the Songhu Garrison. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Mayor Wu at the Municipal Government yesterday and asked if he had received the order and when he would take office. According to Mayor Wu, the Executive Yuan's meeting resolved to appoint him as Commander of the Songhu Garrison, but the order had not yet arrived in Shanghai. He had not heard of this beforehand, and President Wang did not mention it when he came to Shanghai a few days ago. He will schedule the takeover after receiving the order. As for the officers of the Garrison Command, he is resolved not to make any changes to their command in order to facilitate familiarity with the work.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Acting Commander Zhang Handles the Handover <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The Songhu Garrison Command has not yet received an order regarding the Executive Yuan's appointment of Mayor Wu Tiecheng to temporarily serve as commander. According to the acting commander of the Garrison, Zhang Xiang, he has been temporarily holding the post since Commander Dai left Shanghai. Now that the Executive Yuan has appointed Mayor Wu Tiecheng to temporarily serve as commander, he will be responsible for handling all handover procedures when Mayor Wu comes to take office. The command will instruct all departments to prepare for the handover as soon as the order is received.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Important Police Officers Express Intent to Resign <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Xiang, Chief of Staff and Acting Commander of the Songhu Garrison Command, met with reporters yesterday and expressed his desire to retire. Zhang said that he had come to Shanghai with Commander Dai not long ago and had just taken office when the January 28th Incident broke out. He then handled the armistice negotiations. After the end of the Shanghai War and the signing of the armistice agreement, he requested to resign but was not approved. Now that Mayor Wu is about to take office, he intends to resign from the post of Chief of Staff in order to take a rest. It is said that the heads of various departments of the Garrison Command have also expressed their intention to resign.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Huang Fu's Delayed Trip to the North <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Due to the unresolved financial and diplomatic issues in North China</p>
<p>Huang Fu, chairman of the Beiping Political Reorganization Committee, has been residing in Shanghai since visiting Jiang at Lushan, with no intention of returning to Beiping. According to sources in political circles, Huang has met with President Wang and Finance Minister Song several times in Shanghai, but they have not been able to completely resolve the financial and diplomatic issues in North China. Therefore, although Huang has expressed his intention to go north in the coming days, he may not be able to do so for a while. In addition, a member of the Beiping Political Committee arrived in Shanghai yesterday to meet with Huang and report on various situations in North China. Huang did not express any intention to go north. It is said that the member of the Political Committee told others that the plan to reduce military spending in North China has been fully agreed upon. Fang Zhenwu's department has a small number of troops and is no longer a problem. Ji Hongchang's department has been communized and is being dealt with. Although Bao Yulin has decided to resign from the post of director of the Beiping Municipal Police Bureau, Yu Jinhe may not be able to take office for a while.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Shanghai Needs an Airport <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>According to the Continental Daily, Mr. Boli, the manager of the American Continental Airlines, recently went to the United States on business and returned to Shanghai last week. He stated that the future development of Chinese aviation is unlimited and unparalleled in the world today. China has a vast territory, but the development of its transportation system lags behind other countries in the world. The reason for this is that the funding is huge, which leads to simple and crude solutions. The cost of building roads or railways is huge, but opening up an aviation line costs less. It only requires a square area, the construction of an airport, and several ships. Everyone familiar with the world's aviation situation feels that the lack of a suitable airport in Shanghai is a shortcoming in transportation for the prosperity of Shanghai. It is an urgent matter for the interests of Shanghai and all of China. For example, the city of Havana in Cuba recently spent about 300,000 yuan to build an airport to benefit 500,000 residents. Shanghai has 3 million residents and cannot even keep up, which is lamentable. Mr. Boli also said that 32 Curtiss Hawk aircraft purchased by the National Government from the Curtiss-Wright Company have been delivered, including three that were shipped on the Lincoln President last week. The remaining 11 will be shipped within 30 days. It is noted that Mr. Boli is also the vice president of the Curtiss-Wright Company.</p>

<p>The Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association, because the Shanghai Municipal Committee of All Sectors of Society's Committee to Investigate National Salvation Donations requested account books for review, sent various accounts to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce on the 5th of the month and informed the Investigation Committee to review them under custody, in order to avoid any loss. The following are the two letters exchanged between the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Volunteer Army Support Association on this matter:</p>
<h3 id="e127">Letter from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>To the addressee: Received your letter of the 5th of this month, stating that the Committee to Investigate National Salvation Donations of All Sectors of Society in this city is investigating the revenue and expenditure accounts of various fundraising organizations, and therefore, the various account books of the donations were sent to the Chamber of Commerce for safekeeping, pending investigation. This case was discussed at the 46th standing committee meeting of the Chamber, which was submitted to the Municipal Government and Municipal Party Department for investigation, believing that this matter is closely related to the credibility of all sectors of society. I don't know if your association agrees with this proposal, or if the Chamber should forward the submitted account books to the Investigation Committee for processing. This letter is hereby sent for your inquiry, hoping that you will consider it and reply so that we can handle it accordingly. We deeply hope for your response.</p>

Our association only seeks a speedy result. As for your association's proposal, our association has no preconceived notions. Please expedite the matter, and we hope that your association will submit the revenue and expenditure accounts as soon as possible to facilitate the association's work.</p>

<p>The association's regular expenses have always been raised separately by the committee members and have not been used for donations. Recently, in order to reduce expenditures and to prevent the association's work from being hindered, the association's office was moved to No. 13, Lianzhu Lane, Avenue Road, and the four employees who have worked the hardest were retained, while the others have been laid off. The retained are the chief of general affairs, Yang Youren, the accountant, Chen Luxuan, the general affairs officer, Zhang Zhangzhai, and the secretary, Daran.</p>

<h3 id="e130">Japanese Yarn Impersonates Domestic Goods <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Ten Factories Secretly Import Large Quantities of Japanese Yarn</p>
<p>Forge Domestic Tax Receipts for Inspection</p>
<p>The Court Held its First Trial Yesterday</p>
<p>The Case was Adjourned for Ten Days</p>
<p>Ten factories including the Gongzu Socks Factory, Sanyang Cotton Weaving Factory, Jiuyi Weaving Factory, Dingxin Cloth Factory, Yudong Socks Factory, Junchang Dyeing and Weaving Factory, Yunzhou Dyeing and Weaving Factory, Yongyuan Mercerizing Factory, Yixing Company, and Tonghe Dyeing and Weaving Factory, have secretly imported large quantities of Japanese yarn, added artificial modifications, falsely claimed that they were produced by Shenxin No. 5 Yarn Factory, and sold them in the market, deceiving the Chinese people and affecting the reputation of Shenxin. Recently, Rong Weiren, the manager of Shenxin No. 5 Factory, filed a criminal self-accusation against the managers of the ten fake factories, Yu Xifan, Chen Zhongxian, Wang Liwei, Sun Xinzu, Yu Yuxin, Zhou Songmao, Chai Zhixiang, Zhao Bingnan, Wang Gensheng, and Guan Bingqing, requesting that they be punished according to law and demanding compensation for damages of 200,000 yuan. According to the plaintiff, recently, domestic compatriots, in view of the increasingly urgent foreign insults, have successively boycotted Japanese goods. Those who sell and purchase them are ridiculed as traitors and their personalities are demeaned. The raw materials used by the defendants' factories have always been purchased from Japanese yarn factories. They are deeply afraid that once they are exposed, their commercial morality will be lost and they will be abandoned by the Chinese people. Therefore, they disregarded the violation of criminal law. When they reported to the Suzhou-Zhejiang-Anhui District Unified Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance for transportation before their products were made, according to the procedures, they had to submit the tax certificate of the imported raw materials at the same time. They actually transformed the tax certificate of the Limaping brand of the Japanese Dakang Yarn Factory into the Renzhong brand of Shenxin No. 5 Factory to deceive the public. The bureau discovered the above incident and notified the factory to send personnel to investigate and verify the truth. The plaintiff's factory believes that the defendants' behavior not only violates criminal law, but also hinders commerce. Therefore, a lawsuit is filed in accordance with the law. It is clear that the defendants' actions of falsifying official documents are sufficient to cause damage to others, to hold them out for use, or to intend to deceive others as forging trademarks and trade names. Article 225 and other articles 233 and 268 of the Criminal Law all have clear provisions for punishment. Now the defendants have falsified the tax certificate of the Unified Tax Administration of the Ministry of Finance and the trade names and trademarks of this factory for use, which is sufficient to cause damage to this factory and to deceive others. Their intention to violate the above cases is obvious. Furthermore, the fine yarn required by the defendants' factories has always been Japanese goods. Since the September 18th Incident, in view of the enthusiasm of the compatriots to boycott Japanese goods, they have often falsified the tax certificates when reporting for transportation. This is not the first time. They forget righteousness when they see profit and have no conscience. Because they did not obtain conclusive evidence, this factory endured the damage and did not act. This time, the old trick was used again, which was discovered. After the occurrence of this case, people in the community are confused, which has greatly damaged the reputation of this factory, and the damage suffered is extremely serious. Therefore, this lawsuit is filed with your court in accordance with the law, and the defendants are separately detained and tried in accordance with Article 74 of the Criminal Law and Article 225 of the same law, and attached a private lawsuit, requesting that the defendants be jointly and severally liable for compensation for the damages incurred. 200,000 yuan, etc. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Liu Yugui of the Criminal Court of the First Special District Local Court held a trial. Most of the defendants did not come in person, only their lawyers appeared in court and requested a postponement. After the plaintiff's lawyer, Sun Zuji, stated the intention of the prosecution, the court ordered an adjournment for ten days for trial.</p>

<p>This year's Yellow River flood, although not as extensive as the Jianghuai flood of the 20th year of the Republic (1931), is extremely severe. The flooded area covers approximately six million square meters, and about two million people are displaced. The National Government, for the sake of relief, established the Yellow River Flood Relief Committee under the Executive Yuan, specifically to handle disaster relief, work relief, and sanitation matters. The committee was established immediately after Finance Minister Song returned to the country. However, substantial funds are required for disaster relief and work relief, but the government's allocation is limited. Furthermore, due to commercial depression, it was decided not to solicit donations from the public. Just when funds were urgently needed, the committee received 73,539.58 yuan remitted by Mr. Chen Jiageng from Singapore on behalf of the overseas Chinese community there. The committee immediately sent a telegram to express its gratitude and praise his righteous spirit. It is hoped that domestic and foreign philanthropists can all be as generous as the overseas Chinese in Singapore, so that the disaster victims can be benefited, and the virtue will be boundless.</p>

<p>Today's Inaugural Run - Summary of Driving Matters</p>
<p>In order to facilitate passengers and eliminate the need for Route 4 to turn around at Laoximen, the China Merchants Electric Tramway Company has added a branch line from Heping Road to Nanyang Bridge, as well as additional routes in areas such as the Shanghai Garrison. Route 2, which used to run on Zhonghua Road, has been changed to a circular route. Now that various projects have been completed one after another, the company's Traffic Section Chief Lu Zhonglin, Du Ningru, together with Engineering Section Chief Song Zhihou, and Public Works Bureau's Fourth Section Chief Zhang Dengyi participated in and supervised the first trial run yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM. They led personnel from the traffic and engineering departments, starting from Nanyang Bridge, passing Laoximen, Shangwenmen, turning into Daxing Street, passing the Local Government Office, through the Shanghai Garrison, along the Bund, passing Xuejiabang, Dongjiadu, Guan Bridge, Xiaodongmen, along Zhonghua Road, passing Dadongmen, Xiaonanmen, Shangwenmen, Laoximen, and finally reaching Nanyang Bridge. This is the Route 2 circular route. The trial run was very satisfactory. At 4:30 PM, the tram returned to the company. It is scheduled to officially open for operation and ticket sales today, the 20th. The Traffic Department has issued a notice to traffic personnel regarding operating procedures, which are stipulated as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e133">Announcement <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>For the purpose of announcement, the Route 2 circular route is scheduled to officially open on the 20th of this month. Regarding driving matters, a summary is provided below for all ticket sellers and drivers to pay attention to. However, at the beginning of operation, all unresolved matters should be handled appropriately by inspectors and ticket checkers, etc., according to the circumstances. This announcement.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Driving Matters <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>(1) Route 2 trams leaving the factory will have red route signs with four stations marked with red lines, and black route signs with ten stations marked with blue lines. When arriving at the Shanghai Garrison, circular route tickets will be sold. (2) Route 2 red and black route signs entering the factory will all be handled according to the station lines stipulated this time. (3) When Routes 2 and 4 return to the south from Nanyang Bridge, the original Laoximen station will now be relocated to the intersection of Heping Road, and a red pillar will be erected. All Routes 2 and 4 trams traveling south from Nanyang Bridge must stop at the Heping Road intersection according to regulations and only proceed after being directed by the tram supervisor. However, the original station (in front of the Laoda Fang) must also be temporarily stopped to facilitate passengers getting on and off. (4) All trams must pay special attention when passing the Wanhe Sauce Garden in Ximen (the French Concession Route 5 station) and drive slowly to avoid collisions. (5) Route 2 red route signs will continue to stop in front of the Fuan Company in Xiaodongmen as usual to facilitate passengers getting on and off. (6) The tram supervisor stationed at Laoximen should, at the same time, direct Route 3 to enter Zhonghua Road first when encountering Routes 2 and 3 arriving at Laoximen from the north, to avoid congestion at Shangwenmen. (7) The Shanghai Garrison station of Route 2 circular route will use the original station (the Nongtan Elementary School) as the entrance. For example, passengers with red route signs boarding at the intersection of Guohuo Road and Haichao Road and going to Xuejiabang should be calculated as two stations. (8) Switchmen should pay attention. At Shangwenmen Daxing Street, if Routes 2 and 4 trams encounter each other coming or going north to Shangwenmen or south to Daxing Street, Routes 2 and 4 trams can simultaneously enter the single track if they can travel continuously, but the switchman must inform the driver of the tram in front to pay attention. If not informed, or if the two drivers cannot travel continuously, the later arriving tram should stop according to regulations to allow the trams to pass each other before proceeding to avoid causing accidents. Second-class fifteen-minute tickets, because they have already been printed, can be marked at the fifth station for stations below ten stations and considered as eleven stations, and so on.</p>

<p>The day before yesterday was the anniversary of the September 18th Incident and the loss of the Northeast. Meetings were held everywhere during the day to commemorate the event, and entertainment venues were closed to express mourning. At 7:30 PM, the YMCA invited Mr. Zang Qifang of the Northeast Association to give a speech at the Eight Immortals Bridge Hall. His words were extremely painful, and everyone who attended the speech was deeply moved. Mr. Zang's topic was "The Understanding of the National Crisis That Chinese People Should Have." Here is a record of his speech:</p>
<h3 id="e137">The Seriousness of the National Crisis <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, on this second anniversary night of the September 18th Incident, we gather in a room to commemorate the national crisis. Despite such strong winds and heavy rain, you are still willing to come, which shows your deep pain and hatred and your unforgetting of the lost territory. What I want to talk about today is the understanding of the national crisis that Chinese people should have. The Northeast has been lost for two years. To what extent is it serious in these two years? This is really not an easy question to answer. Now let us first examine it from the facts. What was the situation in the Northeast before two years ago? At that time, the Northeast was still in the hands of our Chinese people. What kind of manifestations did the Japanese have with their premeditation? To be specific, from the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95 to today, a full forty years, excluding the recent two years of the Northeast's loss, the Japanese have been preparing every day for the previous thirty-eight years. Since the beginning of the Republic of China, the Japanese have secretly transported large amounts of money from their country to the Northeast every year, bribing people in the Northeast government. It sounds bizarre and unbelievable. At that time, all institutions and even factories, from the chief executives to the small employees, were rarely not bribed by the Japanese. There were several mining companies and coal and iron companies, all of which were jointly run by China and Japan on the surface, with both Chinese and Japanese responsible persons, but in fact, the Chinese only took the money and did nothing. The Japanese even said that the Chinese were working hard and gave them additional remuneration besides their original salaries. So everyone lost their conscience for money and didn't care about anything, and secret news was supplied continuously. If someone asked those employees, "Why do you lose your conscience and take Japanese money?" They would all answer like this, "If I don't take it, someone else will take it. Everyone takes it. Who can blame whom?" In addition, the Japanese also sent various experts in agriculture, commerce, mining, and education, etc., to various institutions in the Northeast as consultants. They were not ordinary consultants, but were working under the orders of the Japanese government. When they returned home, each person had a detailed report. It is really painful to say. At that time, the Northeast had already secretly fallen. The Japanese were determined to destroy the Northeast, always using the excuse of surplus goods and too many people. In fact, Japan itself has enough to supply. Therefore, the reason why they want to seize my Northeast is that they must have it to compete with the major powers of Britain and the United States in the world. Moreover, they will not be satisfied with just getting the Northeast. Soon they will take another step to peep into North China and swallow my entire country. The Yuan's treatment of the Song, the Qing's treatment of the Ming, and the Japanese's treatment of the Republic of China are all the same steps. The Japanese are very familiar with Chinese history. If this continues, the Chinese will inevitably be bound to wait for death. Please also take a look at the current Japanese facilities in the Northeast. In general, the essentials of establishing a country are: first, finance; second, transportation; third, security. In the past, the currency in the Northeast was extremely inconsistent. Liaoning banknotes could not be used in Jilin, and Jilin banknotes could not be used in Jiang Province. Now, the paper money of the (Manchukuo) Central Bank is circulating everywhere. As long as an old coin from the former official silver house is stamped with a (Manchukuo) Central Bank stamp, it can circulate without hindrance. In this way, there is no problem with the unification of finance in the Northeast. As for transportation and security, since the Japanese took over, they have been fulfilling their wishes in every way. The plan of the (Manchukuo) railway network is exhausted, and the investigation of household registration and the confiscation of firearms have made it impossible for the volunteer army to gain a foothold. In another year, they will be deeply rooted, and the future will be even more unimaginable. At present, domestic natural and man-made disasters, in the future, the people of Shandong, Hebei, and Shanxi provinces will be willing to go to the Northeast to reclaim land for him because of their insecure lives. It is absolutely possible for the Japanese to further occupy my entire country. Please, those who care about national interests, like you, think carefully about this serious situation.</p>
<h3 id="e138">The Japanese's Heinous Methods <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>There are about two methods that the Japanese use to deal with our Chinese people: (1) The policy of using Chinese to control Chinese. The most obvious is to support my revolution at the end of the Qing Dynasty. He absolutely does not want my revolution to succeed. He wants to take advantage of my revolution to loot. Since the Republic of China, several civil wars have been instigated by the Japanese behind the scenes. Zhang Zuolin wanted to enter the Pass and ask about the Central Plains. He was afraid that the Japanese would cause trouble behind him. The Japanese said, "Just go ahead and cause trouble. You can rest assured about the rear. We will definitely help." So there was the Fengzhi War. The Anfu clique's assistance from the Japanese is even more obvious. The mutiny of Guo Songling in Fengtian (actually, it cannot be said to be a defection). If the Japanese had not helped Zhang, Guo would definitely not have failed. At that time, it was Honjo Shigeru, who launched the September 18th Incident, who dug trenches for Zhang. In short, the Japanese are always trying to divide China. After the September 18th Incident, they used puppets to organize a government and bribed old warlords to disturb North China. It goes without saying. He always uses the policy of using Chinese to control Chinese. He feels that it is not necessary to use great force to fight these endless yellow people. He wants to save strength and participate in the World War. Therefore, he is now verbally saying that he is friendly and wants to use my government. Unfortunately, the authorities are confused and will often be greatly deceived. (2) The policy of psychological conquest. The Japanese know the ancient saying that attacking the mind is the most important thing. Therefore, they always want to conquer the Chinese psychologically, wanting my Chinese people to regard the Japanese as gods and surrender unconditionally. I have personally seen many people who study in the army in Japan, and their minds have been conquered by the Japanese. He wants you to believe that only he has a solution, and you have no solution. He hates the Chinese people who will always resist Japan and swear to die to resist Japan the most. Therefore, if it is someone like Ma Zhanshan, he will falsely accuse him to death. He hopes that all those who resist Japan will die, so that they can feel at ease and happy. On our side, only those who will always resist Japan and swear to die to resist Japan are worthy of being called true patriots and descendants of the Yellow Emperor of true gods. Whether we are radicals, advocating desperate fighting, or those who endure humiliation and burden, the first thing to decide is the issue of people. First, you have to ask you, does this person have self-confidence? If so, then you must firmly believe that the Chinese nation will have the hope of revival. Second, you have to ask you whether this person can have a spirit of sacrifice. If so, then you should not be threatened in any way, such as Mount Tai collapsing in front of you, and your color does not change. You should not give up the responsibility of resisting Japan for any right, and swear to eradicate Japanese imperialism and its running dogs, so as to revitalize my Chinese nation as an independent country in the world.</p>

<p>Yu Yuanbin, the owner of the Erxiazhai Pharmacy on Henan Road, had a romantic relationship with Lin Xiuzhen, the seventeen-year-old daughter of the widow Lin Dengshi, and went to his ancestral home in Guangdong to officially marry her. He then returned to Shanghai and lived with her for five years without any disputes at first. Recently, Xiuzhen claimed that Yuanbin and her mother were abusing each other, making it unbearable to live together, and fled from Yu's house, returning to her mother's house in the same village on Haining Road. She complained to her old mother, Lin Dengshi, who forgave her daughter for eloping and filed a lawsuit against Yu for kidnapping. However, Yu was unwilling to admit guilt and hired lawyer Yang Guoshu to defend him, saying that he not only did not seduce Xiuzhen, but was actually seduced by Xiuzhen. She threatened him with suicide before going to Guangdong to marry him. After the marriage, the two families visited each other and had a very close relationship. There was no abuse. Recently, because Xiuzhen liked to dance with the opposite sex, he occasionally advised her, but was falsely accused. He requested an investigation. The First Special District Local Court summoned both parties for investigation and concluded that the verdict would be announced later, and hoped that both parties would reconcile. However, neither party was sincere in reconciliation, so reconciliation was impossible. Yesterday was the date for the announcement of the verdict. At 9:00 AM, Judge Feng Shide of the First Criminal Court announced that the defendant Yu Yuanbin was not guilty.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Works Rushes to Repair East and West Embankments <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>The Breach in the East Embankment Has Been Blocked</p>
<p>The West Embankment Is Also Being Repaired</p>
<p>On the second of this month, a hurricane suddenly struck, and the raging waves surged like mountains. The East and West Embankments were both breached. The East Embankment, including the Aiyuli Shishou Chenfu Rongqiang Xia Luyibin and other companies, had more than ten breaches. The remaining earth embankments, which were only one or two-tenths of the original, were about four kilometers long. Although this hurricane was not as severe as the one in the 20th year of the Republic (1931), the wind direction in the 20th year attacked the embankment head-on. Except for the top being damaged, the rest was still intact. The wind on the second of this month swept along the embankment, and the entire embankment was attacked, so the degree of damage and danger was far greater than in the 20th year. After the accident, Shen, the Director of the Municipal Bureau of Public Works, accompanied by his staff, went to investigate and reported to the Municipal Government for allocation of funds for emergency repairs, and decided to block the breaches first. Now this task has been completed by the Bureau's workers, and the remaining damaged earth embankments will be repaired by recruiting workers separately, which can also be started within one or two days. As for the embankment along Jungong Road in Xitang, from the water and electricity plant to the naval hospital, the soil on the side of the embankment was washed away by the hurricane and tidal waves, and the roots of the planted trees were all exposed. The Ding Wu Bureau has sent workers to rush to repair it, first repairing the soil near the roots to avoid the withering of thousands of trees. This project was completed yesterday. In addition, the stone embankment in Wusong and the section west of the fort to the border of Shishan County also had several breaches, and Wu Mufeng was the most dangerous. The Bureau of Public Works sent personnel on the 18th, accompanied by a large number of workers, and materials such as sacks, to rush to repair it in the rain. The Bureau also sent personnel to investigate the damaged stone embankments in Wusong Outer Ma Road and Fort Taiwan, and formulated a repair plan, together with the main project plan for repairing the East Embankment, and submitted it to the Municipal Government for appropriation of funds. It is said that the entire emergency repair project requires filling more than 40,000 cubic meters of soil, and it will take at least 50 days to complete. According to the report of the Observatory the day before yesterday, the hurricane will attack Shanghai for the second time. After hearing the news, the Bureau sent a large number of workers on the 19th, carrying emergency repair materials such as sacks, to the most dangerous location in the East Embankment to carry out the most important emergency work to prevent any eventuality.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Baoshan County Party Headquarters Sends Telegram Opposing the Provincial Government's Surcharge and Reward <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>The Baoshan County Party Headquarters believes that the Jiangsu Provincial Government's method of clearing old taxes in various counties is inappropriate, and sent a telegram to the Party Headquarters of various counties, requesting them to jointly submit a request to the Provincial Party Headquarters to oppose it unanimously. The text of the telegram is as follows: To the Party Headquarters of various counties in Jiangsu Province, and forwarded to various organizations: The Jiangsu Provincial Government has decided to clear the old taxes in various counties due to the large amount of arrears. This move is originally an urgent plan, but it should not encroach on the original tax revenue, so that it can be helpful to the facts. This time, the Finance Department sent personnel to various counties to clear the land tax for the years 16 to 20 of the Republic of China, and to use 10% of the actual amount collected to recover the old arrears over the years as a bonus. The provincial regulations did not explicitly stipulate that the local surtax should be included in the reward. However, according to legal principles, the land tax committee declared that whether it is the regular tax or the surtax, all should be rewarded. If so, the disadvantages have already arisen before the benefits are seen. Furthermore, (1) the regular tax and surtax of several counties have always been divided. For example, the late payment fines, etc., are only added to the regular tax. Therefore, the reward of 10% can only be charged under the provincial tax items. (2) The old arrears of our county for each year have already been included in the budget for each year for the purpose of repaying the loans of various institutions. After the reward, it will be impossible to make up for it. (3) The arrears of grain tax are the result of ineffective collection. Giving rewards for completion is tantamount to encouraging the trend of ineffective collection. In the future, those who collect effectively will also hope for bonuses, and will be even more ineffective. How can they improve the future? (4) According to the customs of our county, the collection of this year's grain tax will end at the end of the year, and at most 30% to 40% will be collected. The rest will be in arrears until the next year and then collected one after another. The accumulated arrears over the years are very large. After the January 28th Incident, our county bore the brunt of the disaster and suffered the most. The funds of various institutions are in huge deficit and difficult to maintain. If another 10% is extracted from the old surtax arrears as a reward, it will be even more difficult to maintain the progress of the cause. In order to take into account the future of local undertakings, our association dares to send a telegram to your association, please jointly submit a request to the Provincial Party Headquarters, which will be forwarded to the Provincial Government, ordering the Finance Department to immediately cancel the reward for local surtax, and ordering the county government to stop the reward. We are impatiently awaiting your orders. Signed, Baoshan County Party Affairs Reorganization Committee</p>

<h3 id="e143">Trial of the Case of Beating Niece to Death <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Blood Stains on Clothes Proven to Be Human Blood</p>
<p>Wang Zhangshi Claims Child Died from Fall</p>
<p>The Case Was Adjourned for Retrial</p>
<p>Wang Zhangshi, a Ningbo woman, 46 years old, residing on the third floor of the Tianlu Candy Tea and Food Store at 209 Caishi Road in the French Concession, is a widow with one son and one daughter. She is known for her violent temper and often abuses her daughter Xiuying (a widowed worker at the Fuchang Tobacco Company)'s three-year-old adopted daughter, Wang Fugen (i.e., her niece), to the point that she suffers from illness and moans in bed. Not only does she not give her medical treatment, but on the evening of the 3rd of this month, at about 7:00 PM, because the child cried and angered her, she beat the child's chin with a piece of firewood, and the child died instantly. Wang wrapped the child's body, took it out, and threw it into a creek near Xieqiao to destroy the evidence. The incident was discovered by the second landlord, Yang Zhushi, and neighbor Zhang Jinan, who reported it to the police. Wang was arrested, and a search was conducted for the child's body, but it was not found. Only a small white cotton short shirt (an undershirt) worn by Wang with blood stains and a piece of white cloth from the bed were found and sent to the Second Special District Local Court for trial. The court sent the blood-stained shirt to the Zhenru Forensic Research Institute for examination. After detailed examination by the medical officer of the institute, the seven blood stains on the shirt were divided into seven numbers. Numbers one to six were confirmed to be human blood without any doubt, and the blood stain of number seven had been washed with soap and still had soap marks. Three copies of the autopsy report were prepared and sent back to the court. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wang Gangxi conducted a trial in the First Criminal Court. The defendant Wang Zhangshi was brought to the court first. Judge: What did you use to beat the child to death? Defendant: She actually fell from the bed and died. I was collecting clothes on the drying platform. Judge: How high is the bed from the ground? Defendant: About the same height as the table (referring to the news reporter's seat in the courtroom, about one foot two feet high). Judge: How could she die from falling from that height? Defendant: The child has been sick for two months. Judge: Has she been treated? Defendant: I took her to the Siming Hospital twice. Judge: Do you have the prescription? Defendant: The prescription was thrown away by my daughter. Judge: What disease did she have? Defendant: Like milk tuberculosis. Judge: What did she look like when she fell? Defendant: I came down from the drying platform and saw that she was not responding. Judge: Was she injured? Defendant: I was so frightened that I didn't see clearly. Judge: Was her head broken and bleeding? Defendant: She fell to the ground, and there was a wound on her forehead and bleeding. Judge: What time did she fall? Defendant: It was a little after seven o'clock. Judge: What time did you take the body out? Defendant: After she didn't respond, after a while, I took it out. Judge: Why did you take it out? Defendant: I was so scared that I took it out and asked Xiao San to throw it away. He wanted three yuan, and I gave him three yuan. Judge: Was it wrapped in cloth when you took it out? Defendant: It was wrapped in old cloth and dressed in clothes. Judge: Since you took it out, why did you lie to the neighbors that the child was at her grandmother's house? Defendant: Her words were vague. Judge: What exactly did you use to beat her to death? Tell the truth, and you can still be forgiven. Defendant: She is my niece, I would never beat her to death. Judge: Where did the blood stains on your clothes come from? Defendant: I don't know. And she stammered. The judge said that the clothes have now been proven by the forensic doctor to be human blood. Where did it come from? The defendant bowed her head and said nothing. The judge asked if it was because the child was crying and she beat her. Beating the child is a common occurrence. Did you accidentally beat her to death? You might as well tell the truth honestly. Defendant: I have never beaten her. At this point, the judge summoned the witness, the second landlord Yang Zhushi (69 years old), to the court and ordered her to swear to tell the truth. After Zhushi swore, she testified that Wang lived in my house with her mother and daughter and the child, a total of three people. Zhang often beat the child and I heard her crying. On the evening of that day, she beat her again and I heard her crying. Then I saw her carrying her out. I didn't think much of it, but the neighbors said that the child was beaten to death. After a while, I saw her returning to the room empty-handed and closed the door. I and Mr. Zhang (i.e., Zhang Jinan) went to knock on the door and asked her where the child had gone. She said she was at someone else's house. I said I wanted to see her. The people around said that you had already beaten her to death. Tell me the truth, and I won't send you away. She then said that she had beaten her to death with one slap and thrown her away. I then reported it to the police. Then the witness Zhang Jinan was summoned to the court. His testimony was the same as Yang Zhushi's. The judge also asked Wang Wangshi if you were on good terms with the second landlord. Wang replied that I don't go to her house, but it's just like that. Judge: Did you hear what the two witnesses said? Defendant: I heard them say that I beat her to death, so I beat her to death. I have no way. At this point, the judge appointed lawyer Huang Jue as counsel for the defendant in court. Later, lawyer Huang requested an adjournment for defense, citing the importance of the case and the need for time to review the files. The court approved it, and then ordered that the defendant be retried on the 23rd and remanded for instructions.</p>

<p>Cheng Yongsheng, a native of Shexian County, Anhui, is 32 years old and works at the telegraph office. He lives near Yuhang Bridge South Yan Gongtang in the city. In the first month of the 14th year of the Republic of China (1925), he married Zhou Ruxia, a woman from the same township, through matchmaking. She disappeared soon after and has been gone for six years. Cheng Yongsheng has hired a lawyer to file for divorce in the local court, citing that her whereabouts are unknown, and has requested public notice. The gist of his petition is that the defendant's life or death is unknown and has been for more than three years. The opposing party is wandering and extravagant and not at ease at home. On the ninth day of the fifth month of the 16th year of the Republic of China (1927), she took the opportunity to run away without a trace. The plaintiff initially hoped that she would change her mind, but the defendant took the lead and repeatedly sent letters through lawyer Lin on the 28th day of the ninth month of the 16th year of the Republic of China (1927), requesting divorce and alimony. Then, in addition to requesting a divorce, she requested the return of her dowry. Finally, in addition to requesting a divorce, she requested to take back her daughter, Zhenbao, who was three years old at the time (now nine years old). He requested that public notice be granted. Yesterday, Judge He summoned the plaintiff, who did not appear. Only the representing lawyer appeared in court to state the previous circumstances and claimed that the defendant Zhou Ruxia's mother and brother have both died. The defendant's life or death has been unknown for more than three years. The judge said that although the letters from lawyer Lin proved that the defendant was willing to divorce, the point of whether her life or death is unknown still needs to be investigated. The representing lawyer was ordered to investigate whether the defendant has any family members or relatives and await verification.</p>
<h3 id="e145">The Dayun Temple Town Robbery Case: Two Bandits Arrested in Shanghai <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>In the spring of this year, after the robbery in Dayun Temple Town, Jiashan County, bandits kidnapped a wealthy Zhou family in Kunshan and demanded a huge ransom. When their demands were not met, they dared to shoot and kill Zhou. Previously, Jiang Deyu, a detective from the First District of the Jiangsu Water Police, arrested two key suspects in the case, Pan Huaiyu and his wife, Ms. Wang. They confessed that their accomplices, Qian Yuxi (also known as Wang Yuxi) from Gaoyou and Zhang Caizi from Xinghua, were hiding in the Hongkou area of Shanghai. Therefore, the previous evening, he came to Shanghai with an informant and found that Qian and Zhang were drinking tea at the Hesheng Tea House at 1107 Donghan Bili Road. The informant confirmed their identities, and reported this to the Hongkou Police Station. Chinese and foreign detectives, armed with weapons, rushed to the address and arrested Qian and Zhang. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court, where Judge Xiao Xie-fen conducted the interrogation. Zhang Tianyin, the police station's lawyer, stood up and stated the case, and presented the confession of the arrested Pan Huaiyu at the Public Security Bureau, as well as a letter requesting their transfer. He stated that the two defendants had denied the robbery and kidnapping charges at the police station. Wang Yuxi used to work as a laborer at a yarn factory on Taopeng Road. It is said that he recently came to Shanghai from his hometown and has only been here for two days. Zhang Caizi has been living in Xiangyan Bridge, working as a secondhand goods peddler for many years. It is necessary to investigate whether this is true. Jiang Deyu, a detective from the Water Police, then explained the situation and requested their transfer. Wang Yuxi claimed that he had been living on Taopeng Road for three years and returned to his hometown in May of this year, only coming to Shanghai a few days ago. Although he knew Pan Huaiyu in his hometown, he knew nothing about the kidnapping and robbery. Zhang Caizi's statement was similar. The police station's lawyer stated that, according to the agreement, sufficient evidence must be presented. Since the two defendants knew Pan Huaiyu, they may be related to the facts. It was also found that Wang Yuxi had committed a gambling offense on August 8th, and was arrested and sent to the court by the police station, and fined twenty yuan. The defendant's statement is also not accurate. Therefore, he did not object to the transfer. After reviewing the statements, Judge Xiao ruled that the defendants Wang Yuxi and Zhang Caizi could be handed over to the Water Police to be taken back for investigation.</p>

<p>Chen Yizhen, a local resident, 47 years old, formerly a teacher, is currently unemployed. He lives at No. 87 Fumin Road, Shangwen Road, Nanshi. He has two sons and two daughters. His eldest daughter, Wei Xian, is 22 years old, gentle and quiet, with the bearing of a lady. In the autumn of 1931, she met Fang Liande, a native of Hebei and nephew of the former Jiangxi Governor Fang Benren, through a friend. Fang is in his twenties and currently a student at Rendé School. They fell in love at first sight and their feelings grew stronger with each passing day. Before long, they were engaged. However, Fang was young and fickle. Recently, he became infatuated with another woman, and his attitude towards Chen changed drastically.</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>Chen found out that Fang was planning to marry the other woman. Upon hearing the news, Chen was filled with regret and remorse. The day before yesterday, she obtained forty yuan from her father and went to Room 57 of the Dongfang Apartment on Beile Road in the French Concession that evening. She also went to Room 59, the room of Fang's friend Guan Yi-yun, to talk and planned to question Fang severely. Unfortunately, Fang was out. Her feelings of disappointment were evident in her words, and she spoke pessimistically. Guan comforted her repeatedly until midnight, when Chen reluctantly returned to Room 57, saying that she would wait for Fang to return. After Chen left, Guan recalled Chen's grief and despair and feared that something might happen. He was unable to sleep. At 1:30 AM yesterday morning, Guan tiptoed to Chen's room and peered inside. The door was tightly closed, and there was no sound. He knocked on the door, but there was no answer. Realizing something was wrong, he immediately called the tea room attendant and broke into the room. He saw Chen lying on the bed, unconscious. A Lysol bottle was left on the table, indicating that she had committed suicide by taking poison. She was rushed to Baolong Hospital for treatment, but as of last night, she had not regained consciousness, and her life was in great danger. At the same time, her father, Chen Yizhen, rushed to the hospital upon hearing the news. Witnessing his beloved daughter's tragic situation, he could only weep in sorrow.</p>

<p>Reply from the Ministry of Interior to the National Physicians' Association Regarding the Extension of the Deadline for Alternate Physician Certification</p>
<p>The National Physicians' Association previously received letters from the Hankou Huaining and other Physicians' Associations stating that since the Ministry of Interior's alternate physician certification measures were promulgated, a year had passed. However, due to the vastness of China and the prevalence of natural disasters and man-made calamities, those residing in remote rural towns or living as travelers may not have seen the official notice, and some may have been missed. They requested the General Association to petition the authorities to extend the deadline in order to achieve universal coverage. The National Physicians' Association petitioned the authorities to postpone the deadline. Yesterday, they received Reply No. 39 from the Ministry of Interior, which stated: "The petition is noted. The temporary measures for alternate physician certification were promulgated in August of the 21st year of the Republic of China, with a one-year deadline, starting from the date of receipt in each locality, with the provision that (areas affected by bandits and special circumstances are excluded). The dates of receipt in each locality varied, generally falling between September and October. The situation described in the petition is therefore not inappropriate. The request for an extension should not be considered." It is reported that the association has already issued a notice to the Huaining, Hankou, and other physicians' associations to take note of the Ministry of Interior's reply.</p>

<p>The Chinese and Foreign Relief Society received a telegram from Nanhui County stating that the area was devastated by a hurricane and heavy rain on September 12th and 13th, causing the collapse of embankments and flooding. The society immediately dispatched specialists to conduct on-site investigations. According to their report, the affected area includes districts 1, 2, and 4, with District 1 being the most severely affected. The tidal surge was extremely strong, causing damage to crops and houses. The flooded area covers more than 200 square miles, including over 100,000 mu of farmland. If the floodwaters do not recede, the autumn harvest is hopeless. Approximately 20,000 mu have been affected. More than 10,000 people are living outdoors, exposed to the wind and rain, and have lost their homes. Not only do the embankments need immediate repair, but the Wanggongtang Harbor has also become heavily silted over the years and urgently needs dredging, otherwise, the consequences will be unthinkable. The society considers the immediate needs of emergency work and disaster relief to be the most important and urgent tasks. However, fundraising is difficult and they are seeking donations. If Heaven helps those who help themselves, they will be able to proceed actively.</p>

From January to August of this year, it collected a total of 17,567 coffins of all sizes, provided 7,998 coffins of all sizes, and provided 36,335 free medical consultations. It is reported that since the year of Wuchen, the villa has been burying corpses found floating in rivers and temporarily interring corpses in the interior of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and has collected 72,123 corpses to date. Furthermore, in the summer of last year, after seeing reports in Suzhou about an epidemic, General Director Wang Yiting appointed Director Wang Junsheng to investigate in Suzhou. It was determined that the city's river was polluted and a health hazard, so efforts were made to clean it up. A total of 383 coffins exposed around the city and suburbs were buried, 2,257 dead animals such as floating rats, cats, and dogs were collected from the river, 119 boats of garbage were dredged, 35 dried-up public wells were repaired, and 20 storage boxes for dead animals were installed. The river water was cleaned, which was a great convenience for the residents and beneficial for drinking water. However, due to the decline of various industries, donations to the villa have become scarce, and expenses have become increasingly large, and funding has become increasingly depleted. One person's efforts are not enough. It is necessary to rely on the collective efforts of the community to succeed. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will consider public health and contribute generously to maintain this good cause.</p>

The goods were piled up like mountains and sold out in a flash. The main factory was in full production, and cars were delivering goods in a constant stream, which was truly the peak period for Invincible.

<p>Rich in Content and Extremely Valuable</p>
<p>"Historical Materials on Diplomacy During the Late Qing Dynasty" was compiled by Wang Yifu of Huangyan, Beiping. It contains nearly all of the unequal treaties of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty, the establishment procedures for consular jurisdiction and the loss of tariff autonomy, telegraphs about war negotiations, trade boundary divisions, as well as transcripts of meetings between the Zongli Yamen and the ministers. Such confidential manuscripts were not disclosed in the former Qing Dynasty. Wang served in the Imperial Secretariat for nearly 20 years, personally copying them and storing them at home. His son, Xi Yin, proofread and edited them into a book, and searched for important documents from the Xuantong reign of the Qing Dynasty to continue the compilation. He also wrote subject indexes, connecting things according to type, to facilitate checking. The entire book totals 120 volumes and is truly a valuable resource for those studying modern Chinese diplomacy. Now, British and French people, seeing the book's thorough and comprehensive content, have discussed translating the index to facilitate study. Since its publication, there has been a constant stream of domestic and foreign orders, and requests for special arrangements to facilitate distribution. However, there are few copies remaining. Once sold out, it will not be easy to reprint. Those who study the history of the Qing Dynasty should order as soon as possible. The general distributor is Nai Zi Fu Guan Dong Dian 7, Beiping. Local distributors in this port include Cheng Xuemen, Mao Zhenchu of the Chen Bao Guan, the Da Gong Bao branch on Jiujiang Road, and the Hua Tong Book Store at Wangping Street. Samples can be requested by mail.</p>

<p>Chinese Medicine Practitioner Ni Xi'an Adds a Medicinal Tube Acupuncture Department Dr. Ni Xi'an has been practicing medicine in Shanghai for two months and has cured many internal and external diseases. Recently, he added a medicinal tube acupuncture department. The medicine is applied to the acupoints to radically cure the source of the disease. The effect is like an echo and does not damage the muscles and collaterals. It is said that he learned it from the secret transmission of the Zhaoshi family of Nantang Xin, and it is a unique acupuncture method in Shanghai. The clinic is still located at No. 8 Yanging Lane, Beichengdu Road.</p>
<p>Qin Dunfei, Specialist in Traumatic Injuries, Begins Practicing Medicine Qin Jun Dunfei is the grandson of the famous doctor Qin Heqi. As a young man, he traveled north to Liaoning and Shenyang, and south to Yueqiāo, where he met extraordinary people and learned the art of fighting and treating injuries. After tiring of traveling, he returned to his hometown and became a renowned physical education professor in Shanghai. In his later years, Qin Heqi, feeling sad about his age, took him under his wing and taught him medicine. Qin Jun practiced by his side, received his personal instruction for several years, and deeply mastered the secrets of the family's tradition. Whenever a relative or friend in the neighborhood fell or was injured, he would try his skills with a small dose of medicine, and regardless of the severity of the injury, it would always have a miraculous effect. This spring, his teacher suddenly passed away, and Dunfei took over the clinic. He has now established his own clinic at No. 80 Yifuli, at the intersection of North Baoshan Road and the Shanghai North Railway Station. All internal conditions, such as consumptive diseases and internal injuries, and external conditions, such as fractures, dislocations, muscle strains, gunshot wounds, and lacerations, will be cured upon diagnosis and treatment.</p>

<h3 id="e164">Setting the Stage <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>— Bing Ding</p>
<p>The Chinese are most adept at the art of (setting the stage), even foreign architects admire them to the point of prostration. Just look at the tall Western-style buildings in Shanghai, aren't they first (scaffolded)? For example, the twenty-two story Four Banks Joint Savings Society warehouse currently under construction on Jing'an Temple Road, is covered with very high bamboo scaffolding, densely layered. Isn't its artistry remarkable? Also, families celebrating or mourning, and new businesses opening, must erect many scaffolds to create a spectacle. To the laborers who build these scaffolds, it's truly an easy job. With just a few bamboo poles and some bamboo strips, in less than half a day, they can erect a dignified and imposing decorated shed.</p>
<p>The art of building scaffolds is astonishing. A few rough and strong laborers in blue cloth, haphazardly erect a few bamboo poles, tie them together with strips of bamboo, and layer upon layer, in a moment, the scaffolding is completed, laying the groundwork for a magnificent and splendid structure. Or, they adorn it with colorful decorations and dazzling lights, making it appear vibrant and flourishing; in reality, it's just a bamboo scaffold.</p>
<p>It's the same with a person. If you want to create a spectacle and raise your status, you must start with (setting the stage). Friends who don't (set the stage) are bound to be left behind in today's society. They will be ridiculed, scorned, and mocked. This is the result of (not setting the stage). Scaffolding is extremely important for building houses; scaffolding is also crucial for (the art of getting along in the world).</p>
<p>Officials need to put on an official air, managers and directors need to put on the airs of managers and directors. Therefore, capitalists need to put on the airs of capitalists. Even servants in mansions, teachers in schools, compradores in foreign firms, and procuresses and prostitutes in brothels, all have their own airs to display their status. However, the wonder of (setting the stage) is subtle and difficult to put into words. Where it can be set, it must be set; where it cannot be set, it's best to dismantle it quickly. Only then can it be considered the art of (setting the stage). For example, bureaucrats (put on airs) when they see ordinary people; but when they meet their superiors, or their wives or concubines, they must dismantle their fragile façade. Managers and directors (put on airs) when they see their staff, but when they see old shareholders, they must dismantle their feeble facade. Being able to set up and dismantle is the mark of an expert in (setting the stage).</p>
<p>Friends who are on good terms achieve good fortune through the (art of flattery) and become successful, of course they need to put on airs to show off their power. I believe that putting on airs everywhere with a puffed-up chest is not necessarily a loss of a heroic nature. Only those experts in (offensive airs) who set up and dismantle them haphazardly are chilling, does a hero have this ability to (bend and stretch)? But, setting the stage is ultimately a matter of pride for a hero!</p>
<h3 id="e165">Rickshaw Pullers <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>— Xian Xian</p>
<p>A certain celebrity advocates not riding rickshaws because having (people) pull (people) is (inhumane), so if one must ride, it should be a car, or better yet, just use one's own two legs and (walk instead of riding). That's right, by (practicing what one preaches) like this, there's no fear that the rickshaw pullers will all starve to death, and thus China's (barbarism) can be reduced a little. But we uninspired and awkward friends, cannot afford to ride in cars, and our legs are not strong enough to rely on walking alone, so we have no choice but to rely on rickshaws. Although (people pulling people) is somewhat (inhumane), rickshaw pullers still depend on us (inhumane philanthropists) to avoid ending up in a ditch.</p>
<p>Although people often argue with rickshaw pullers over a single penny and even insult their parents and ancestors for eighteen generations, when they pick up a pen to describe the lives of rickshaw pullers, they express one hundred and twenty percent sympathy and pity. Even the beads of sweat on the rickshaw pullers' backs become the author's tears, although in reality, when the rickshaw puller is out of breath, the author is scolding, ("Pig, why don't you run faster!")</p>
<p>The only (virtue) of rickshaw pullers is naturally (honesty in returning lost items), but even robbers sometimes have moments of kindness, let alone rickshaw pullers. But, in fact, rickshaw pullers who are (dishonest in returning lost items) are more common than those who are (honest in returning lost items). As for those who don't roll their eyes and insist on adding two or three cents to the fare just because the destination is in an alley, and who don't get scolded by the passengers, they are as rare as stars in the morning sky.</p>
<p>On North Sichuan Road, Avenue Joffre, the Bund, and in the residential areas of foreign dignitaries and high-class Chinese, rickshaw pullers are indeed more pitiful than dogs. Especially when a customer sits sideways in the corner of the rickshaw, their feet almost touching the rickshaw puller's back, fully demonstrating the (art of riding in a rickshaw), the rickshaw puller has no choice but to show off their ability to compete with cars. But the rickshaw pullers who pick up customers at the train station or pier have a different face, and they are always walking (slowly) and stopping halfway. They will then dump the rickshaw and shout, ("I won't pull this long distance without more money!")</p>

<p>— Nu Xia</p>
<p>There is a retired military officer named Dengtu in Heidelberg. He had won many battles during the European war, until his left foot was injured and he had to leave the military. At that time, because his ankle was shattered, it could not be cured, so the doctor sawed off his foot. He was very reluctant to part with his round foot, and repeatedly asked the doctor to cut off his second and third toes and return them to him. Then, he soaked them in medicine, and then dried them in the sun. When they were hard and smooth, like snails, he sent them to a jewelry store to be made into a watch charm, which he wore on his chest every day. He still strokes and kisses them from time to time, considering them ten times more precious than medals won with blood and flesh.</p>

<p>Chapter Fifteen: The Departing Guest Leaves Behind a Bashful Smile of Tenderness, The Visiting Person Brings Old Malice and Opens a Troubled Heart</p>
<p>He said, "I heard that Master Gan Er is already doing something in the city, and he is no longer working with his brother." Gui Zhi blushed and said, "Mother Liu, please don't mention this person. I hate this person to the core. You don't know, one day I delivered goods to their house, and they coaxed me out. I am a girl, and a poor one at that, what can I do to deal with people? I can only endure it. So even now, whenever I hear Gan Jizhi's name, my head hurts." Mother Liu heard that this was why she was dissatisfied with the Gan family, and it was no wonder that the more she talked about the Gan family, the more she blushed. Seeing this, she realized that it would be better for her to say less. So she didn't dare to stay long, and after talking for a few words, she left. But Mother Liu's character was different from Gui Zhi's. She thought that associating with rich people was a matter of face, and anyway, she would only take advantage of them, not the other way around. Moreover, she was an aging old woman, and the Gan family didn't mind her visiting. So after she heard these words at Gui Zhi's house, in less than twenty-four hours, those words were completely conveyed to Mrs. Gan's ears. Mrs. Gan was not only not angry when she heard this, but she was actually delighted for a while. She felt that she had been prescient in opposing Jizhi's association with Gui Zhi, knowing that Gui Zhi would not be able to cooperate with him. This news had to be made known to Jizhi, so that he could regret it a little. However, at this time, Jizhi was teaching at a school in Nan Yuan Da Hong Men, which was also in the suburbs. To transmit the news from the western suburbs to the southern suburbs would take considerable effort, so it wasn't until two months later that Jizhi returned to the city from Nan Yuan to buy things and encountered a relative, that he got some news from the relative's mouth. However, it was not easy for him to leave his school. Counting the principal, teachers, staff, and workers, there were only four people in total. A round trip from Nan Yuan to Haidian would take a whole day, how could he leave the school for a day? Another month later, he got a holiday, and he took advantage of an early morning to rush to Haidian in the western suburbs. (192)</p>
<h3 id="e168">Earth Store Bodhisattva's Birthday <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Zhou</p>
<p>The sun had just jumped into the mountain gully, and Lingling was pestering her grandma to stick incense for Earth Store Bodhisattva. Grandma, unable to resist her pestering, said, ("It's too early! Earth Store Bodhisattva won't open his eyes until it's completely dark!")</p>
<p>Lingling had nothing to say! She ran to the yard and stood there, standing like a statue, anxiously watching the sky. The sky finally darkened, so dark that the banana tree standing on the other side of the yard could not be seen clearly. She ran back again, calling out to her grandma, saying, ("Now we can stick incense!")</p>
<p>("Why are you in such a hurry? You can do it after you eat!") ("Hmm, I don't want to! Didn't you just say to stick incense when it's completely dark?")</p>
<p>But in the end, she sat down to eat with her grandma and brother. She only ate half a bowl of rice, and then put down her chopsticks and said to her grandma, ("Grandma, can we...")</p>
<p>("Wait until I finish eating!")</p>
<p>Today, Grandma seemed to be deliberately teasing Lingling, and she ate her meal especially slowly. Lingling could only wait patiently. Finally, she saw Grandma stand up, and she followed behind her, calling out, ("Good Grandma, hurry, go quickly!")</p>
<p>Grandma took out four plates of cakes from the food cabinet and placed them on the stone steps near the house in the yard. She also took out an incense burner and two candle holders and placed them in front of them. She also took out a large cup of clear water from the water tank and placed it in a straight line with the three items above. She also folded a hat worn by monks in (Journey to the West) with colorful flower paper and placed it in the center of them.</p>
<p>Her brother stood in front of this (display) and bowed several times, and then dipped his hand in the clear water in the cup and wiped his eyes. Lingling also skillfully did the same, but she bowed two more times.</p>
<p>Grandma gave her more than ten incense sticks, but she thought it was too little and asked Grandma for more. Grandma replied that children cannot stick too many incense sticks, and she only took this much herself. But Lingling thought to herself, "You take less because you are old and can't bend down, but I'm not like you!"</p>
<p>Her brother stuck many rows of incense sticks in the empty flower bed and called her to come and see. She understood that those were some words, and she recited, ("Don't forget that this year is the Year of National Products!") He also stuck many incense sticks in a large radish. A rope was tied to the roots of the radish. He waved this (incense ball), waved it, and waved it on this moonless night, like a shooting star! She looked at it with envy.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Miscellaneous - A Drunkard's Ramblings on Wine <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Youqing</p>
<p>Wine is indeed a good thing. When we open Li Bai's poetry collection, we read the line "Drunkenness can dispel ten thousand years of sorrow," which is so fascinating. That's right, wine can dispel sorrow, but to say it can dispel ten thousand years of sorrow is just an old man's boastful language.</p>
<p>"May I ask, where can I find a tavern? A shepherd boy points to Apricot Blossom Village." This poem has been recited by many people. Some people have broken it down: "May I ask, where can I find a tavern shepherd boy, pointing to Apricot Blossom Village." (Changed to a line of different lengths, I think this poem is more interesting.</p>
<p>(Drinking with a bosom friend, a thousand cups are too few). When a close friend suddenly comes, it is really a time to drink and talk happily, and have a heart-to-heart conversation. If it coincides with the saying "meeting an old friend in a foreign land", then it is even more enjoyable.</p>
<p>(When a guest comes at midnight, flowers are used as wine). This saying may refer to rural areas. If it is in a bustling city, then rest assured, when a guest comes at midnight, tea does not have to be used as wine. You can take your guest to the dance hall, and the wine problem can be solved. Even in cities without dance halls, there is no obstacle. You can open a hotel. Don't say you only have wine, even if you want to drink wine and look at flowers, it's very easy.</p>
<p>Wenjun selling wine, Xiangru wearing shorts. This couple unexpectedly fits the modern trend. Widows marrying can be protected by law, and marrying a widow is not a shameful thing. When their love matured, they fled to another place. One held a wine pot as a stove, working as a modern female server and shop assistant, and the other wore the most fashionable shorts to work as a waiter, solving their living problems. Compared with what father-son drug store and brother company, they have cooperated to the end. Xiangru was originally a literary beggar, but for the sake of his lover, he was willing to be a waiter, which is so sincere. It can be said to be an unprecedented great event since the opening of the tavern.</p>
<p>The late Minister of Personnel, Zhuo, was often dismissed from his post for drinking. When the neighbors brewed wine, he would steal a drink. He was tied up by the person in charge of the wine, only to find out in the morning that he was the Minister of Personnel. He was released and asked to get drunk by the jar. This Mr. Zhuo, even after becoming the Minister of Personnel, still wanted to steal other people's wine. He could be said to be a man of refined style, regardless of small matters. With a cup in his hand, everything else was forgotten. ("Everything is inferior to a cup in hand.") When we pass by the door of a wine shop, we see many drinkers holding cups in their hands, with happy faces, which is so beautiful. They feel that with a wine cup in their hand, they don't care about anything else, which fits the saying ("A pot and a bag contain a big universe"). Liu Ling's Ode to Wine is more sincere than the Duke of Zhou's Proclamation on Wine. He couldn't wait for everyone to comb their hair three times after one bath, and spit out their food three times after one meal. No wonder he had to write a Proclamation on Wine. That Mr. Botong saw through everything, loved wine as his life, and wanted to die drunk, so he wanted people to carry a wine jug with him and bury him when he died. This saying is so humorous and profound. Shaw is ultimately inferior to the Wine Saint.</p>
<p>Xinling, fine wine, women. Translating this, it means eating wine and playing with women. Unexpectedly, the current dance halls, opening champagne and playing with dancing girls, have been preempted by that Zhao Gongzi. Originally, wine and sex are two paths that people in the world can hardly escape, especially now that it is an era of revealing flesh, even more unable to see through and jump over. I remember Confucius also said, he said: (I have never seen anyone who loves virtue as much as they love sex.) There is also a saying: (Only wine is limitless, but not to the point of chaos). From this point of view, wine is not necessarily undrinkable, and women are not necessarily unplayable. After all, people who love virtue are fools. The country is in such a state, there is no need to worry about it. It is better to hold a wine glass, hug a dancing girl, or hire a prostitute to serve wine, how interesting. In literary terms, it is called romantic, in colloquial terms, it is romantic. Romanticism fits the modern view of life.</p>
<p>The most famous in the wine country is of course the old Mr. Chun Yuyi. He can eat wine in various ways. One bucket is drunk, and one stone is also drunk, it is a gourd belly that can be big or small. Originally, drinking is a general interest. If one can loosen the collar of the silk robe and faintly smell the fragrance, then at that time, don't say one stone is drunk, even if a few more stones are added, that old gentleman may not necessarily be drunk. This humorous passage in the Historical Records, I want to give to the people who go to dance halls, so that they can get more tips.</p>

<h3 id="e170">Jiangsu Province Waives Tuition and Accommodation Fees for Provincial Schools <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>Implemented from the 23rd academic year; other fees will also be reduced. Zhou Fohai, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education, noting that students in schools throughout the province were facing heavy burdens, coupled with a faltering social economy, resulting in outstanding but impoverished students being deprived of educational opportunities due to financial constraints, which was a great pity. He proposed to the Provincial Government that, starting from the 23rd academic year, all students in Jiangsu's provincial primary and secondary schools should be exempted from tuition and accommodation fees. The 300,000 yuan in educational funding annually subsidized by the provincial treasury would be incorporated into a special fund to offset the waived tuition and accommodation fees. Due to practical constraints, it was not immediately feasible to implement this for county-run schools and private schools. It was proposed that after the finances were slightly improved, separate plans for offsetting and implementing free education would be considered. It is noted that few provinces currently implement the waiver of tuition and accommodation fees. Zhou's initiative not only provides tangible benefits to impoverished students but also has a significant positive impact on the future of education. It has been learned that the proposal has been approved by the Provincial Government. The original text of the proposal is as follows:</p>
<p>To reduce the economic burden on students, increase educational opportunities for impoverished students, expand education, and enhance its practical effectiveness, it is proposed that provincial primary and secondary schools waive tuition and accommodation fees for students starting from the 23rd academic year. Other fees will also be reduced. All waived fees will be offset by incorporating the existing funds subsidized by the provincial treasury into a special fund to ensure stable income. County-run schools will be addressed separately after financial conditions improve. We would set up a separate panel to plan the subsidies required to implement free education. Please decide on this proposal. Proposed by Zhou Fohai, member and Director of the Department of Education. (Explanation) An investigation reveals that students in schools throughout the province bear tuition, accommodation, and textbook fees, amounting to nearly one hundred yuan for middle school and one or two tens of yuan for elementary school. Families with average financial resources or below are genuinely concerned about their ability to afford these costs. However, in recent years, rural areas have declined, and the rural economy has faltered. It is common to hear of families using their entire year's income, which is insufficient to cover their children's educational expenses, leading to students dropping out or being unable to enroll. Education is a national undertaking, and schools are the state's means of cultivating talent. However, economic constraints cause talented students from impoverished families to be buried, which is not only a loss for individuals and families. In light of this, the Department of Education deeply feels that reducing the financial burden on students' families is an urgent task. Due to practical constraints, it is not immediately feasible to implement this for county-run schools and private schools. It is proposed that after the finances are slightly improved, separate plans will be drawn up to actively plan subsidies and implement free education. It is proposed that provincial schools waive tuition and accommodation fees starting from the 23rd academic year. Other miscellaneous fees collected will be rigorously standardized and substantially reduced to alleviate the burden on students' families and increase educational opportunities for impoverished students. The annual amount of tuition and accommodation fees collected by provincial schools that are included in the budget for offsetting expenditures is approximately 200,000 yuan. It is proposed that this amount be waived, and in the future, the original funds subsidized by the provincial treasury for education be incorporated into this fund to ensure stable income and offset the losses. The provincial education funds from land taxes are set at 1.4 yuan per stone of tribute rice and 4.7 fen per tael of silver. It is proposed that, starting from the collection of tribute rice this year, 2 jiao per stone be added to the item of tribute rice, for a total of 1.6 yuan, to be directly collected by the Education Fund Management Office from various counties for offsetting. This will not increase the burden on the provincial treasury budget but will greatly benefit the practical effectiveness of education. Please approve the implementation if deemed appropriate.</p>

<p>(Qingdao, 19th) Twenty-four students in the normal school of Lizhong went on strike on the 18th due to poor teaching. They went to the Education Bureau to petition, but there were no results. The students are temporarily staying at the Gaosheng Inn.</p>
<h3 id="e172">Executive Yuan Approves Ministry of Education Proposal on Expenditure Standards for Establishing Secondary Schools <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 19th) The Executive Yuan meeting on the 19th approved the Ministry of Education's proposal to establish expenditure standards for establishing secondary schools in various provinces and cities. (1) By the 26th year of the Republic, the allocation of secondary education funds in each province should reach the following standards: Vocational schools should not be less than 35% (including vocational training schools), normal schools should account for approximately 25%, and general middle schools should account for approximately 42%. (2) To achieve the aforementioned standards, starting from the 23rd year of the Republic, any new funding for secondary education in each province should be used primarily for vocational and normal schools. Those that are unable to increase funding should reduce the corresponding amount of funds from general middle schools each year to expand vocational and normal education. (3) When reducing the number and levels of general middle schools, each province must consider the following standards: (1) The average development of secondary education throughout the region, (2) Performance in recent years and examination results, (3) The number of graduates admitted to excellent specialist schools and higher institutions in recent years, (4) Senior high schools should be centrally located in several central locations. If there are two middle schools with senior high school classes in the same location, the senior high school classes should be merged and established separately. (5) The provincial and municipal departments and bureaus are required to prepare a detailed outline plan based on the aforementioned expenditure allocation standards and deadlines before the end of December of the 22nd year of the Republic and submit it to the Ministry for approval. The detailed implementation plan for the 23rd year of the Republic must be submitted for approval before the end of February of the 23rd year of the Republic. After approval, it will serve as the guideline for each province to prepare the budget for educational expenditure in the 23rd year of the Republic. (6) The standards and deadlines listed in item 1 also apply to county and municipal middle schools throughout the province. The departments will plan and supervise their implementation throughout the province. (7) Each department and bureau should strictly examine private middle schools. In addition to banning those with poor equipment and operations, they should also supervise them to convert into vocational schools or vocational training schools, so as to achieve a balanced development of private middle schools and private vocational schools by the 26th year of the Republic. The above measures are carefully formulated in accordance with the central government's long-standing advocacy of promoting productive education and the Ministry's efforts to promote vocational schools, which are crucial to national education. It is requested that all provincial and municipal governments be ordered to strictly comply with them and instruct their subordinates to comply as well.</p>

<p>Women's Softball: Dongya vs. Southeast for Championship Today</p>
<p>There Are Also Two Football Matches, Track and Field Starts Tomorrow</p>
<p>Yesterday was the fourth day of the Shanghai City Games. Football and tennis were suspended due to wet fields after heavy rain. The men's volleyball semifinals were held in the Chinese Basketball Gymnasium starting at 4:30 PM. As a result, Fudan and Hujiang qualified for the finals. The two teams are full of talent and have strong strength. It is unknown who will emerge victorious in this intense battle. In addition, in women's softball, Dongya played against Guoguang. Dongya won with a score of 80 to 3. Today at 10:00 AM, Dongya and Southeast will compete in the finals in the Basketball Gymnasium. In addition to the above two finals today, there will also be two football matches, starting at 2:00 PM at the baseball field. Men's and women's tennis were still unable to be held due to wet fields. Details are listed below:</p>
<h3 id="e175">Fudan Overwhelms Yinghua <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>The Fudan volleyball team has dominated Jiangnan for many years. After returning triumphantly from their summer tour of the South, they have not yet assembled for practice. Yesterday was their first battle against Yinghua, and they revealed flaws everywhere. They lost one game to Yinghua. The team's cooperation did not seem to have reached its best. Qiu Guangxie's spikes were indeed powerful. As a result, they eliminated Yinghua with a score of 3 to 1. Today, they will compete against Hujiang in the finals.</p>
<p>Fudan: 20 to 23, 21 to 9, 21 to 6, 21 to 9 Yinghua</p>
<h3 id="e176">Fudan's Unfavorable Start <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>Yinghua served first, taking a 3-2 lead. Fudan added three points to make it 5-3.</p>
<p>There was minor contact between the two sides, but not to a tense point. Yinghua's Huang Zi made a jump serve that violated the rules, making it 7-5, then 10-6. Yinghua repeatedly held the advantage. Fudan launched a fierce attack. Qiu Guangxie tried his long arms for the first time, closing the gap to 8-10, but Yinghua still held the advantage in the first half with 11-8. After switching sides, Qiu Guangxie's fierce kill tied the score at 11. Xie Baochang's high shot missed, and Yinghua once again took the lead, jumping to 18-14, then 20-16. Seeing the unfavorable situation, Fudan quickly chased after them, taking back Yinghua's serve. Zou Bingxin scored on a serve, making it 20 all. They fully intended to strike at the heart of the enemy, but unexpectedly Cheng Mingjue missed a kill, giving Yinghua a match point. At this critical moment, Yinghua's Yang Zhiqiang double-faulted on the serve, tying the score again at 21. In the midst of the chaotic battle, Yinghua's front-row blocking was effective, and Qiu Guangxie's repeated kills were deflected, resulting in the loss of two points. Yinghua thus won the first set 23-21.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Winning the Next Three Sets <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>After a minor setback, Fudan regrouped. Xie Baochang started the serve and scored five points in a row. Yinghua continued to work hard, but couldn't catch up, as Fudan's technique became more proficient and the situation changed. Fudan won the first half of the second set 11-7. Afterwards, Fudan was successful in every aspect, playing with ease, while Yinghua struggled to resist and were at a loss. Fudan retaliated with a 21-9 victory. In the third set, Yinghua appeared even more uneasy, while Fudan's momentum grew stronger. Yinghua only scored two points in the first half. Fudan's Chen Bocai added five points with his serve, and Chen Zongqi served ten times in a row. Fudan then won again with a score of 21-6. In the fourth set, Yinghua rallied their spirits, hoping for a miracle, and took an early lead with 5-1. Fudan did not show any weakness and soon took the lead with 7-5, ultimately taking the lead in the first half with 11-7. The rest of the game belonged to Fudan again. Zou Bingxin also served eight times in a row, and Fudan won again with a score of 21-9, for a total score of 3-1.</p>
<p>Fudan's lineup: Cheng Mingjue, Xie Baochang, Cai Tiange, Zhang Qunguang, Chen Zongqi, Zou Bingxin, Zhou Jieming, Qiu Guangxie, Chen Bohe.</p>
<p>Yinghua's lineup: Lu Xiong, Zheng Zhiyong, Guan Jinlin, Mai Bingguang, Huang Zize, Qu Deming, Jiang Jiayan, Zheng Weiguo, Yang Zhiqiang.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Shanghai University Beats Dongya <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai University volleyball team has a wealth of talent, an organized lineup, and demonstrates excellent coordination in passing and spiking. The back row's defense is solid, the front row's blocking is strong, the setting is accurate, and the middle row of three players can show their skills, delivering powerful spikes. Lu Kangyuan is particularly outstanding, and the other players are also consistently good. It is indeed a strong and complete team, and Fudan will probably find it difficult to deal with. Although Dongya does not have any outstanding players, they put up a strong resistance against Shanghai University with their excellent serves and effective defensive coordination. In the end, Shanghai University won in straight sets, but it was not easy.</p>
<p>Shanghai University 21-15, 23-21, 21-12, Dongya</p>
<h3 id="e179">First Set: Comeback Victory <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Dongya's Li Daitian served first, but was repelled by Shanghai University, making it 3-0. After 5-2, Dongya scored four consecutive points to take a 6-5 lead. After 6-6, Shanghai University took the lead again at 8-7. Dongya's Huang Peihua made it 9-8. The Shanghai University front and middle rows coordinated well, launching a rapid and fierce attack to gain the advantage. Dongya refused to be outdone and tied the score at 10-10, but Shanghai University took the lead and switched sides at 11-10. Dongya rallied their spirits and put up a tenacious fight, briefly overtaking Shanghai University at 14-12. However, they then collapsed and lost all momentum to Shanghai University. Lu Kangyuan displayed his skills, serving like a cannonball, overwhelming the opposition. Yan Chongji's serve resulted in 21-15 in one breath.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Second Set: Tense Situation <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>Dongya reorganized their forces. Zhu Zhicheng's serves were rapid and forceful, scoring three consecutive points. Shanghai University retaliated, also scoring five points. Dongya advanced to 7-5 and then 9-7, in a rather good situation. Unexpectedly, Shanghai University still took the lead in the first half at 11-9. After switching sides, Shanghai University took the lead. Dongya suddenly found themselves in a pressured situation, but after 15-19, Dongya intensified their efforts, using Tan Xi's powerful serve to disrupt Shanghai University's defense, making it difficult to defend and reducing opportunities for counterattacks, resulting in a tie at 19. However, Tan Xi double-faulted on a serve, ruining all their efforts, and Shanghai University won again with a score of 23-21.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Third Set: Dongya Collapses <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>Since Shanghai University had already won two sets, the overall outcome seemed to be decided. In the third set, Dongya again made mistakes due to panic and lost again with a score of 12-21. After the start, Dongya won two points first. Shanghai University's Yan Chongji served beautifully, adding five consecutive points. Dongya's Huang Peihua showed his strength and retaliated with a heavy spike, tying the score at 5-5. Then Shanghai University's Ruan Shuyiao's serve led to a win in the first half at 11-6. After switching sides and the score being 13-8, both sides displayed their skills in spiking and blocking, showing excellent technique, with an attack and a block going back and forth five or six times, earning thunderous applause. Shanghai University's momentum was strong, and their work became more and more coordinated. Dongya collapsed and lost.</p>
<p>Shanghai University's lineup: Xu Senlin, Lu Kangyuan, Yan Chongji, Wang Jiajun, Huang Jinliu, Li Shufen, Liang Zhihui, Huang Hanming, Ruan Shuyiao.</p>
<p>Dongya's lineup: Yang Dilin, Du Yurong, Tan Xi, Chen Jiongjian, Ling Hongzhao, Zhu Zhicheng, Peng Guangxin, Huang Peihua, Li Daitian.</p>

<p>Dongya Defeats Guoguang 80-3; Skills are Average and Rules are Unclear</p>
<p>Among Shanghai's girls' schools, women's softball is seldom promoted. Therefore, it's not surprising that the skills are immature, and even the rules are often not understood. The strangest thing is that the referees also fail to fully understand, inevitably making minor errors. Yesterday's game between Dongya and Guoguang, held in the China Basketball Hall, was completely devoid of artistry. In the end, Dongya won with a score of 80-3. The scores for each inning are as follows:</p>
<p>Dongya 3, 3, 2, 22, 0, 3, 16丨80 points</p>

<p>Men's and Women's Shot Put Set New Provincial Records; Huang Zhen of District Eight Scores 9.84 Meters</p>
<p>(Zhenjiang, 19th) The opening ceremony of the Third Jiangsu Provincial Games was held at 8:00 AM on the 19th at the Zhenjiang Public Stadium. Present were Provincial Chairman Gu Zhutong, directors of various departments, guests from various party and government agencies, athletes, and thousands of male and female spectators. First, Wu Bangwei, the Secretary-General of the Games, led the athletes from each district around the field (athletes from District One did not participate). They then proceeded to the podium for a parade and formal greetings. Zhou Fohai, Director of the Department of Education and Chairman of the Games, delivered the opening speech, stating that the purpose of the games was to encourage learning and competition, but not as the ultimate goal. He hoped that participants would pay attention to their usual performance and demonstrate good sportsmanship, rather than focusing on showcasing skills.

Then, the Zhenjiang Boy Scout Troop and over 700 male and female students from the Zhenjiang Normal School performed calisthenics. Various competitions began at 10:00 AM.</p>

<p>District One Wins Over District Ten The preliminary round of the basketball match between District One and District Ten began at 10:00 AM. The referee was Zhang Le. As the whistle blew, District One's center, Guo, scored first. District Ten's Song Jinhai, formerly a star player at Labor University, was as agile as ever. With a wave of his left hand, he also scored two points. The two sides repeatedly advanced and retreated, but they mostly relied on long shots, which were often unsuccessful. At the end of the first half, District Ten took a slight lead with 9-6. After a short break, District One's situation did not improve. Song Jinhai and Zhu Hengru of District Ten scored continuously. At the widest point in the score difference, District Ten had 15 points, while District One had only 8 points. District One requested a timeout. The situation changed greatly in the second half. Wu Taiguang, who had been lying low for a long time, scored three consecutive field goals, and Guo, the center, also continued to score. The scoreboard showed that District One had come from behind to take the lead. District Ten tried to catch up, but it was too late. In the end, District One won with a score of 23-18.

<p>District Two Wins Over District Eleven After the match between Districts One and Ten ended, District Two and District Eleven took to the field. From the start, District Two used steady and fast passing, long throws, and short shots to great effect. On the other hand, District Eleven was at a loss. Chen Lun, the key player of District Eleven, accumulated four fouls and had to leave the court just ten minutes into the game, creating a one-sided situation.</p>
<p>In the second half, District Eleven showed some improvement. Lu Xianrui and Chen Kuncun scored seven or eight points in a row, but it was fleeting. District Eleven soon collapsed again.

District Eleven, having lost too many players, was not in the mood to fight, and the situation became extremely lax. By the end of the game, District Two won by a large margin with a score of 72-25.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, the preliminary round of the soccer match between District Two and District Thirteen was held. The referee, Le Xiurong, gave the order to start, and District Thirteen kicked off first. District Two attacked with the wind, taking a clear advantage.

After this, there were several opportunities for District Two to score, but they all missed. At the end of the first half, District Two led 1-0.</p>
<p>After the break, the two teams switched sides and engaged in a chaotic battle for twenty minutes without any progress. Xu Huikang of District Two, the left winger, frequently entered the enemy territory, waiting for an opportunity to strike. The center forward lofted a ball to the front, and Xu tracked it down, passing it to Li Bingfang, the right inside forward, who kicked it into the net again. Soon after, Pan Jiangnian moved forward with all his might and scored a third goal. Wang Hanzhang also kicked in a fourth goal.

<p>In the first singles match between Wang and Yang, Wang's serve was like a cannonball, and his aggressive smashes put pressure on the opponent. Yang was unable to defend and lost the first set. In the second set, Yang tried his best to cope, but Wang still won with a score of 6-4. In the third set, Wang made many unforced errors, and there were many wild balls. Yang took the opportunity to get to the net and drop shots, which proved to be very effective. The precise placement of the shots forced Wang to run all over the court, and Yang won the set with a score of 6-2. In the fourth set, Wang rallied and played cautiously. Yang was unable to respond and only won the first game. Wang ended the match with a score of 6-1. The referee was Feng Jiasheng.</p>
<p>In the second singles match between Gong and Zhang, Gong's serve was also strong, and his low shots were sharp and accurate. Zhang was able to fight and made few mistakes.

<p>The men's 100-meter preliminary round consisted of five groups of eight people each. In the first group, Liu Rongbo from Zone 1 maintained the provincial record with a time of 12 seconds. The remaining four groups' scores were two at 12.2 seconds, one at 12.7 seconds, and another at 12.8 seconds. Lu Ya Xiong, a Zone 6 athlete who had participated in the provincial games twice and created numerous new records, had recently broken his own Jiangsu province record with a time of 11.8 seconds at the Zone 6 Games. Therefore, when he appeared, the audience watched him intently, with many asking each other, "Which one is Lu Ya Xiong?" However, Ya Xiong's legs betrayed their master in front of everyone, allowing Wang Hongjin from Zone 2 to reach the finish line first by half a head, relegating him to second place. An hour later, the semi-finals began, divided into two groups, with three from each group advancing. Ya Xiong was placed in the second group and failed to qualify. In today's final, Wang Hongjin from Zone 2 has a better chance, but Zhao Congsun from Zone 4 and Liu Rongbo from Zone 1 are also formidable competitors.</p>

<h3 id="e214">Agreement and Explanation <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Ming</p>
<p>It is a matter of course that superiors do not need to seek the consent of their subordinates for their actions. However, sometimes superiors will explain to their subordinates.</p>
<p>A newly famous world figure said: "Authority existed in primitive times. For example, humans force animals to obey their will, causing them to abandon their free lives, without seeking the animals' consent." This statement is thorough. Otherwise, where would we get beef to eat and horses to ride? The same is true for humans towards humans.</p>
<p>The Japanese bishop recently declared that Japan is the angel mentioned in the Bible: "God will use Japan to conquer the white people who have always slaughtered Jews… to liberate the Jews by force and fulfill the old prophecies." This obviously does not seek the consent of the white people, just as the white people who slaughtered the Jews never sought the consent of the Jews. The Japanese masters in China created the "National Crisis" without seeking the consent of the Chinese people. However, it is another matter when some local gentry seek the consent of the Japanese masters and ask them to maintain local security. In short, to freely eat beef, ride horses, etc., one must declare oneself to be the superior and others to be the subordinates, or compare people to animals, or regard oneself as an angel.</p>
<p>However, the most important thing here is "force," not theory. Neither sociological nor Christian theories can produce any authority. Primitive people's authority over animals arose from the invention of bows and arrows. As for theory, it is merely an explanation thought up afterward. The function of this explanation is to create a religious, philosophical, scientific, and global trend-based foundation for one's own authority, so that slaves and cattle are suddenly enlightened to the laws of this world and abandon all dreams of overturning it.</p>
<p>When superiors explain to their subordinates, you, as a subordinate, must not misunderstand this as seeking your consent, because even if you absolutely disagree, they will still do what they want. They have their dreams, and as long as the power of gold, silver, treasures, airplanes, and artillery is still in their hands, their dreams will come true; while your dreams will ultimately remain just dreams. If, by chance, they come true, they will even say that you copied their old animalistic article.</p>

<p>— A Ying</p>
<p>(5) Firewood, Rice, Oil, and Salt</p>
<p>"(Liangxi Manzhi)" contains a story about "scholars praying for leisure," saying that God asked a scholar, "What do you desire?" He replied, "My desires are very small, and I dare not hope for too much, but I only wish that my life would be adequately clothed and fed, and that I could leisurely live among the mountains and streams until the end of my days." God said, "This is the joy of immortals, and you will not get it." What does this fable illustrate? It is that in the Song Dynasty, the dreams of pastoral poets had already been shattered by "life." Therefore, a poem recorded in a Ming Dynasty novel:</p>
<p>Firewood, rice, oil, salt, sauce, vinegar, and tea,</p>
<p>All seven are in other people's homes.</p>
<p>I cannot worry about it at all,</p>
<p>So I will till the bright moon and plant plum blossoms.</p>
<p>In reality, it is already an "occasional" phenomenon, or "self-consolation." Since the bright moon and plum blossoms cannot be eaten, how can one pick up a hoe, and how can people live? The following poem in "(Lianpo Shihua)" is quite interesting:</p>
<p>Books, paintings, zithers, chess, poetry, wine, and flowers,</p>
<p>I have never left them for years.</p>
<p>Now all seven things have changed,</p>
<p>To firewood, rice, oil, salt, sauce, vinegar, and tea.</p>
<p>A leisurely life and careful study are impossible under unstable living conditions. Firewood, rice, oil, salt, sauce, vinegar, and tea, which constantly swirl in your mind, will always hinder your thinking. Such a poem is a good satire of life. In fact, there is no leisurely tune anymore; at least there will be laments such as "The whole family is in the wind, and the clothes for September have not yet been cut." How should we solve this suffering?</p>
<p>(6) Model of Occasional Writing</p>
<p>Yang Xungi of the Ming Dynasty "(Su Tan)" records:</p>
<p>Zhou Boqi often went to Wu to sell his writings.</p>
<p>He had written nearly a thousand articles in his life. Opening the scrolls, from beginning to end, they were all inscriptions for halls or epitaphs for tombs. Even works celebrating birthdays and mourning deaths were interspersed among them. However, Boqi's talent was particularly strong in this area. Every time he wrote an article for someone, he would gain something, often a tael of silver, or at least one or two hundred coins. Boqi always agreed and promised, writing several articles a day without end. The quality of the work depended on the generosity of the patron. However, as soon as Boqi picked up a pen, he could produce an article, writing in neat, small characters, even in cursive, without seeming to tire. Could it be that his talent was particularly suited to this? After his death, not a single original work of his was left. Those who knew him regretted that he had talent but misused it.</p>
<p>I once wrote an "(Occasional Article)," but I have never mentioned someone who devoted all their life's energy to this work, nor do I know of such a person. Recently, after reading "(Su Tan)," I obtained this information, and I feel that I can add something to it. Writers like Tongcun can be said to be experts in occasional writing. Bookstore owners could publish his collection as a "(Model of Occasional Writing)," and in the current time when occasional writing is needed, business will surely flourish.</p>
<h3 id="e216">Miscellaneous Talk (Little Devils) — Xu Maoyong <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Shi Heng criticized Arcibašev's "(Sanin)," believing that Sanin was "(not a historical archetype)" but "(entirely the fruit of artistic fantasy, that is, the author's ideal character)." Therefore; and because the author's artistic creative power was weak, "(it resulted in something very exaggerated and very artificial)."</p>
<p>There is some truth to these words. However, we see that no matter what kind of writer, when creating丨丨or should say describing丨丨a typical character, they often cannot avoid exaggeration and artificiality. Even Bazarov or Rudin under Turgenev's pen have a lot of exaggeration and artificiality to make the reader recognize that there is a typical figure of the era. In addition, like Cervantes's "(Don Quixote)," Goncharov's "(Oblomov)," and Lu Xun's "(Ah Q)," if the author does not add a little exaggeration and artificiality to the typical characteristics of their characters, then the character will not become a typical one, because the typical characteristics are usually mixed in with many ordinary qualities. Without exaggeration and artificiality丨丨that is, what is called "(close-up)" in film art丨丨it is not very obvious. In the countryside, we meet and live with many characters with "(Ah Q spirit)" every day, but before Lu Xun's close-up, our understanding of the characteristics of this Ah Q was never as clear as after reading "(The True Story)." Therefore, the reason why Sanin did not become a typical figure of the era is fundamentally because there was no such character in the social position, which I think is not very related to the author's artistic creative power.</p>
<p>In Russian literature, many writers have created typical characters of the era. Like Bazarov, he is "(an out-and-out model of the new era)," containing "(the hope of new production)." But there are also those who reflect the bankruptcy of the old era and appear as typical representatives of weak human nature, such as the Rudin and Oblomov mentioned earlier, and Sollogub's Peredonov in "(Little Devil)."</p>
<p>Peredonov is a middle school teacher. The goal of his life is to become an inspector of schools. Therefore, he was deceived by his cousin Varvara, who said that there was a duchess who was willing to give him the position of inspector of schools if he could marry Varvara. But he demanded to be an inspector of schools first and get married later. Finally, Varvara forged the duchess's letter of appointment, and they got married. However, in the end, someone told him about the scam, and he was so angry that he killed someone. Sollogub not only wrote Peredonov's character very mean and weak, but all the other characters were also ugly. Except for a few beautiful chapters describing the love of a young couple, almost the entire book is a description of the baseness of human nature. The technique is extremely delicate, with a tragic character as the keynote and many comedic elements added. The book was first published in the "(Problems of Life)" magazine in 1905 and gradually gained a lot of praise and scolding. Those who scolded it said that the protagonist Peredonov was actually a portrait of the author Sollogub himself, and determined that Sollogub was such an ugly and mean character. Sollogub responded to this, saying:</p>
<p>"(Indeed, people like to be loved and are willing to show the sublime aspects of their souls. Even in important people, they hope to see the flash of goodness, the ancient so-called (spark of divinity) (L'etincelle devine). If someone makes a true, correct, ambiguous, and ugly portrait for them, they will not believe it and will think: (This is the author talking about himself!))</p>
<p>(However, not so; dear contemporaries, what I wrote in Little Devils is you. Many of the characters inside are people from among you. This novel is a mirror of the aurora, which I carefully polished with great effort. Its surface is smooth and its texture is pure. I have taken great pains to strive for accuracy. No matter what is reflected on it, it will not change in the slightest, and each will return to its original beauty and ugliness.)</p>
<p>Now the new literature is a signpost, but there was indeed a long period when literature was a mirror of life. Perhaps the difference between New Realism and Old Realism lies in this. But next to the signpost, put a few true and correct portraits, pointing to the devils and zombies on the old road, making people disgusted and terrified, and increasing their enthusiasm for the new road. Is such literature still needed now?</p>
<p>"(Little Devils)" does not yet have a Chinese translation. Probably the translators predicted that no one would want to read it, so they didn't translate it丨丨In addition, the current trend of trusting creation and disliking translation is also a reason. However, if such a book comes out, I know that there will definitely be many people who will read it. Why? Because people of the Peredonov type (Peredonovschina) are too many in front of us, and there are already countless people in our literary world alone. If a mirror is made, they themselves will surely look at themselves and feel pity, and others will surely take it as a warning.</p>
<p>Although Wu Jingzi's "(The Scholars)" and Wu Woyao's "(Strange Events Witnessed Over Twenty Years)" had "(weak artistic creative power)," the influence of these books was great. I hope that there are now writers with rich artistic creative power who can write the typical figures of the modern Chinese Little Devil丨丨But many tabloid literary magnates who are interested in slandering individuals, exposing secrets, and have no artistic creative power are not their choice.</p>

<p>— Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>Zheng Banqiao said in "(Sending Du Transport Officer Lu Gong's Poem)": "(Clear words are quite like Wang Wei, and learn the essence of Du Fu again.)" This can be said to be the same as saying it about himself. We see that his "(Visiting Ren Gong at Fahai Temple)," "(Revisiting Ren Gong with Abbot Qilin)," "(Sitting at Night in the Mountains)," and other poems are like learning from Wang Wei, while poems such as "(Seven Songs)," "(Crying for the Ox Child)," "(Harsh Official)," "(Evil Private Punishment)," "(Returning Home Trip)" are very similar to Du Fu's poems such as "(Writing in Tonggu County)," "(Stone Moat Official)," and "(Farewell Without a Home)." "(Showing Younger Brother Mo in the Office)" says: "(Learning poetry from three people, Lao Man is also included. Du Fu is after, and Ji Dan is before.)" The third sentence can be proof of learning from Du Fu.</p>
<p>Banqiao's poems are mostly written by impulse, without checking; therefore, a good poem often reveals its fox tail. For example, the last sentence of "(White Gate Willow Flowers)": "(Travelers on the road all love me, and it is okay if I get my lover's pity)," and the last sentence of "(Chrysanthemums for Ten Days)": "(Avoid the warm wind and withstand the cool)," both feel stiff and without poetic meaning. The poem "(Yin Bu)" is written with great energy, showing Banqiao's true colors. In "(Fan County Poems)," the second poem, which describes the little boys and girls of Sang Pang, is the best.</p>

<p>— Written by Joseph Conrad, translated by Shi Heng</p>
<p>Before him the sun rose gradually above the treetops, and the mist lifted a corner. The breeze was cool; the glory shone on the rippled water and appeared on the lake. The woods also revealed the clear and distinct shadows of the morning, becoming clearer, as if they were closer, and the movement of the leaves and the swaying of the branches also seemed to stop suddenly. In the merciless sunlight, the sounds of nature rose, speaking in an incomprehensible language, telling of the dumb sorrow of mankind. Asat's gaze slowly drifted, staring at the rising sun.</p>
<p>"I can't see anything." He said to himself in a voice that could not be heard.</p>
<p>"There was nothing to begin with." The white man said, walking to the corner of the bamboo platform and waving at his boat. A slight shout came from the lake, and the sampan began to fly towards the home of this ghost-like friend.</p>
<p>"If you want to come with me, I can wait for you one morning," the white man said, looking at the water.</p>
<p>"No, Tuan," Asat said softly, "In this room, I will not be able to eat or sleep, but first I must see my way. Now I can't see anything—I can't see anything! There is no light, no peace in the world; only death, the death of countless people. We are sons of the same mother, but I abandoned him to the enemy's hands; but now I want to go back."</p>
<p>He took a breath and continued in that dreamy tone.</p>
<p>"After a while, I will be able to see clearly, and I will be able to fight—to fight. But she is dead, and…now…darkness."</p>
<p>He waved his arms, then let them slide down along his body, and stared at the sun with that immobile face and stone-like eyes. The white man ran to the boat. The oarsmen skillfully ran along the side of the boat, and looked back from their shoulders at the starting point of the weary journey of the day. The captain, wrapped in white cloth on his head, sat gloomily at the stern, gliding his oars on the water. The white man put his arms on the grass roof of the small cabin, looking back at the sparkling ripples stirred up by the boat. When the sampan had not yet left the lake and reached the river mouth, he raised his eyes. Asat still did not move. In the light of the scorching sun, he stood alone; he had ventured into the darkness of a phantom world beyond the light of a cloudless white day. (End)</p>

<h3 id="e222">Call Loan Rate Remains at 6% <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>丨 Bank Receipts Vary in Complexity 丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, the call loan rate remained at 6%. Payments with and without surcharges were made accordingly. Due to the flooding of the Bund area outside the Shanghai Concession caused by the recent wind and rain, various goods could not be loaded or unloaded, leading to a stagnant situation. The payment of general commercial debts was inevitably delayed, and transactions could not proceed as smoothly as desired. Consequently, the collection and payment of silver dollars varied in complexity among banks. Those with urgent needs inevitably sought ways to expedite matters, while non-essential transactions were largely suspended. Therefore, the money market exhibited varying degrees of urgency regarding collections and payments. Call loan transactions amounted to over 4.8 million yuan in the morning, with over 900,000 yuan in new transactions and over 200,000 yuan in afternoon transactions. Transactions in the Small General Association totaled over 400,000 yuan, and pawn transactions amounted to 800,000 yuan. Banknote withdrawals and issues amounted to 3 million yuan, a weak figure. Customer sources totaled 200,000 yuan, with withdrawals of 250,000 yuan. Foreign banks collected over 2.0 million yuan in bill payments, 3.23 million yuan in silver dollars, over 2.1 million yuan in special payments, and over 4.0 million yuan in various goods, exchange pledges, miscellaneous telegraphic payments, and 4.4 million yuan in silver dollars. Outgoing warehouse silver amounted to 600,000 yuan and 1.2 million silver dollars. Chinese banks collected 2.45 million yuan in bill payments, over 5.4 million yuan in various goods, exchange taxes, pledges, and miscellaneous payments, 2.8 million yuan in special payments, and 800,000 yuan in outgoing warehouse silver. Native banks collected over 41.1 million yuan in public silver dollars and over 5.8 million yuan in surcharge payments, over 800,000 yuan in exchange payments from various locations, and 890,000 yuan in cash. The total amount exchanged at the clearing house on the 19th was 3,939,135.12 yuan in silver dollars, including 2,024,076.15 yuan in silver dollars and 1,915,058.97 yuan in exchange drafts.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Jiangnan small silver coins were 832.5 yuan in both the morning and afternoon markets, the same as the previous day's afternoon market. Transactions totaled 6,500 dimes in the morning and 4,000 dimes in the afternoon. Guangdong small silver coins were 788.5 yuan in the morning and 788.8 yuan in the afternoon, a decrease of 1.2 yuan from the previous day. Transactions totaled 80,000 dimes in the morning and 20,000 dimes in the afternoon. Copper coins suddenly decreased by 3,000 wen, reaching 311,000 wen. Transactions were limited due to a small supply, totaling only 30,400 strings, equivalent to 9,800 yuan in silver dollars.</p>

<p>Prices Show Minor Differences, More Increases than Decreases</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Merchants Stock Exchange saw slightly more activity than the previous day, with a noticeable increase in transactions. However, price fluctuations remained minimal. There was no confirmed news regarding the issuance of new public bonds. There was some trading in long and short positions, with only the "46 Issue" seeing significant selling, while the rest were balanced with no major changes. In the morning session, the "46 Issue," from the Armistice Issue to the Salt Tax Short-Term Loan, saw selling across all categories, mostly for October delivery, likely due to customer transactions. The "50 Issue" also saw some selling, with prices falling by 0.1 to 0.35 yuan. In the second session, sellers became scarce, and buyers were slightly stronger, causing prices to rebound by 0.1 to 0.35 yuan. However, the current month's contracts for the 20-volume issue and the Salt Tax Issue were still slightly down by 0.05 or 0.1 yuan. Prices generally recovered after the morning decline and remained flat. In the afternoon session, the market continued to be slightly firm and stable, with prices improving by another 0.1 yuan. There was slightly more demand at the close, with prices improving by 0.05 to 0.15 yuan. Forward contracts were relatively weak, and there seemed to be a potential for a rebound or short squeeze. However, until the issuance of new public bonds is confirmed, the market is likely to continue fluctuating. With the settlement date approaching, there may be slight changes. Overall, yesterday's market saw mixed price results, with more increases than decreases. Most of the increases were in the current month, around 0.05 to 0.25 yuan, while most of the decreases were in the following month, around 0.05 to 0.1 yuan. The total transaction volume was 6,446,000 yuan, including 1,000 yuan in spot transactions. Futures contracts, including the Consolidated Salt Tax, totaled 2,380,000 yuan, the Armistice Issue accounted for 1,075,000 yuan, the 1920 Customs Issue for 515,000 yuan, the 20-volume and 20-Customs Issue for 1,195,000 yuan, and the Gold Short-Term Loan and the 1916 Issue for over 400,000 yuan each, with the remainder ranging from tens of thousands to over a hundred thousand yuan.</p>

<p>A report from the Sino-Foreign Trading Company stated that the New York stock market fluctuated on the 18th. Due to the U.S. Treasury Department setting the gold price at $31.44 and the weakness of the U.S. dollar, gold, mining, oil, and several commercial stocks performed well, while the rest declined, especially steel stocks, due to the lack of winter orders. However, the overall trend of the stock market still seemed bullish. The total trading volume for the day was 2,720,000 shares. At the opening, wheat buyers continued to purchase, boosting the market. However, due to excessive speculation, prices fell again. With the potential realization of inflation, buying is likely to continue in the future. The cotton market was strong, largely based on the inflation theory. October futures deliveries and Southern hedging were absorbed. Silver was strong due to the weakness of the gold dollar. The Dow Jones indices are listed below:</p>

<p>The yarn market is showing fatigue with hints of declining prices. The proposals to maintain prices are likely lacking any definite strategy. With actual demand lacking, and no excitement on the horizon, the situation has weakened. Few buyers are present, and the outlook remains bleak.</p>
<p>The People's Yarn Exchange market opened higher with the rise of foreign cotton, and market sentiment was good. Prices for all months rose by 8, 9, and 10 dimes. Market sentiment suddenly shifted during the second session, and prices fell across the board during the third closing, dropping by 7, 8, and 9 dimes for all months. News during the afternoon session indicated flat current yarn sales, and prices fell again by 2 and 3 dimes for all months. The total transaction volume for the day was 49,200 bales. Sales included 1,200 bales from Shen Ji, 950 bales from Yi Yu, 1,750 bales from Heng Chang, and 1,550 bales from Xin Cheng.

<p>The cotton market opened nervously in the morning due to the previous day's wind and rain, causing buyers to increase purchases, raising prices by 3 to 4 dimes. However, after a partial investigation revealed that the center of the wind and rain was in the Shanghai area, with losses mainly in the Tongzhou native cotton varieties. Other cotton plants were largely unaffected. Although American cotton rose in price, the gold price had fallen, so market sentiment was neutral. In addition, shipments from various locations were gradually increasing. There were reports that 8,000 bales of Yao cotton would arrive in Shanghai tomorrow, with lower prices expected. The Zheng Brand market opened higher due to the rain, rising by 3 to 4 dimes. During the second and third sessions, as the weather cleared and the wind shifted northwest, bringing light, prices fell by 0.05 to 0.25 yuan for all months. The market remained firm at the afternoon opening, but weakened slightly during the second and third sessions, with closing prices slightly higher, rising by 0.05 to 0.2 yuan for all months. The total transaction volume for the day was 210,700 piculs. Sales included 6,300 piculs from Chun Ji, 3,100 piculs from Da Feng, 5,500 piculs from Ming Hua, 3,900 piculs from Chang Ji, 3,200 piculs from Shen Ji, 3,600 piculs from Xin Cheng, 4,000 piculs from Xin Hua, 3,600 piculs from Tai Xing, and 6,500 piculs from Chang Feng, 3,200 piculs from Yuan Xing Chang.

<p>Mills Reduce Supply...Declining Trend Weakens</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, each month showed initial firmness followed by a decline. Foreign wheat quotations, Chicago, were good by 0.1 yuan, and Canada was good by about 0.4 yuan. Therefore, at the opening, market sentiment continued to be strong, with near and far terms improving by close to a point. However, after this, prices gradually declined, because although there was news of taxes on foreign rice and wheat, the market was currently suffering from sluggish sales, and there seemed to be no need for it. Therefore, once the mills began to sell, market sentiment returned to decline. By the time the afternoon market opened, the situation for each month was weak, but the supply from the mills was slightly reduced, and the declining trend also weakened. According to the current situation, sales must be brisk for the market to have any hope. Otherwise, heavy accumulation will make it difficult to turn around. As a result, the current month was down by 0.01 yuan from the previous day, October was down by 0.0175 yuan, November was down by 0.0225 yuan, and December to February were each down by 0.025 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e230">Wheat Follows Flour Market's Fluctuations <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market showed initial gains followed by a decline after the morning opening. Foreign wheat quotations improved by about 0.1 to 0.4 yuan, so at the opening, each month had risen by 0.02 to 0.03 yuan compared to the previous day. However, by the second and third sessions, market sentiment softened due to the decline in the flour market, and opening prices also eased. The previous day's bullish trend was purely speculative hype and, based on factual analysis, lacked a solid foundation. The initial rise followed by a decline was likely due to this. In the afternoon sessions, market sentiment fluctuated, with little upward or downward movement, but transactions were still active. As a result, the current month to February each fell by 0.03 yuan. Current wheat also eased by 0.03 to 0.04 yuan due to the decline in standards. Delivery was still brisk, with Shao Bo wheat opening at 3.723 yuan, Gao You wheat at 3.75 yuan, and second grade at 3.63 yuan. Tong wheat opened at 3.78 yuan, and second grade at 3.74 yuan. Yangzhou wheat opened at 3.67 yuan, and second grade at 3.56 yuan. Yao Wan wheat opened at 3.88 yuan, and second grade at 3.75 yuan. Bengbu wheat opened at 3.82 yuan, and Luhe wheat opened at 3.59 yuan, for a total of 15,000 bags.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, rice from the river areas was cut off due to the big storm, and because cargo congestion at the wharves had been cleared, the market was stalled, and no transactions occurred. However, when the storm subsides, a large supply will inevitably arrive, so the rice market may fall again.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, arrivals from the river areas were limited to only one or two boats due to the heavy wind and rain. Although local firms were eagerly seeking supply, sales were few. Medium-grade and lower-grade Peng rice prices rose slightly, and high-quality goods held steady. New Yangjian, Tuanjian, and Bujjian grades each rose by 0.1 yuan, with no changes in the rest.</p>

<p>Yesterday, following the previous day's bullish trend, market sentiment was extremely good in the morning for Guest Xian rice. Suppliers shouted for increases of 0.3 to 0.4 yuan, and foreign rice also called for higher prices of 0.2 to 0.3 yuan. Buyers thought the prices were too high and took a wait-and-see approach. Quanzhou, Ningbo, Shantou, Xiamen, and local dealers had intended to arrange shipments, but because of the repeated price hikes, they found it difficult to reconcile costs and selling prices and did not inquire. However, Fuzhou dealers, who had stopped buying for a long time, were in urgent need and did not mind the high prices, continuing to buy in the market. They bought 360 bags of new Xiang new machine Jing rice at 7.3 yuan and 608 bags of new rough rice at prices ranging from 6.2 to 6.12 yuan. Prices were up 0.2 to 0.3 yuan compared to yesterday's market. However, after this batch was sold, it was difficult for the other dealers to break even, so the market outlook was bearish. If the supply increases today or tomorrow, prices will immediately fall back. If there are no new arrivals and Fujian dealers continue to buy greedily, the market may stabilize.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market rebounded as customs duties increased. The public association quoted 24 group ordinary coarse granulated white sugar at an initial price of 21.55 yuan, later trading at 21.45 yuan for one or two hundred bags. Supply gradually tightened, and the market became firm again. Dutch Red PK brand was at 16.45 yuan, up 0.05 yuan from the previous day. Taikoo Sugar B mark was at 21.5 yuan, and W mark was at 21.4 yuan, down 0.1 yuan from the previous day. China National Huamain white top grade was at 20.65 yuan, first grade at 20.45 yuan, second grade at 20.25 yuan, third grade at 20.05 yuan, and fourth grade at 19.85 yuan.

<p>After the appearance of new Tong'an dried longans, the supply was limited, so prices immediately rose by 10 yuan in the second session at the top shops. But the third batch of goods still arrived in small numbers, continuing the tight trend, causing large top-grade longans to rise again by 5 yuan. At the same time, older goods also rose accordingly. The market outlook is quite strong.</p>

<p>Fragrant Mushrooms Have Poor Harvest, Market Remains Firm</p>
<p>(Dried Mushrooms) Recent telegrams from the production areas have reported gradual price increases. Local firms have also checked their stock and found they do not have much, so the market has been revitalized. Yesterday, a Tianjin firm offered three boxes of Miao Beikou mushrooms at 795 yuan, five boxes of Miao Kou Ding mushrooms at 778 yuan, and two boxes of Eight Banners Kou Ding mushrooms at 420 yuan. Traders bought actively, and all arrivals were sold, with prices for each grade up 30 to 40 yuan compared to the previous session. However, retail sales have not yet begun, otherwise the price increases might not be limited to this.</p>
<p>(Fragrant Mushrooms) This year's new crop in various regions is not abundant, so the supply is limited. Local and Hankou firms have recently had strong demand, causing prices to rise daily. Lanxi and Tunxi thick mushrooms are currently priced at 220-230 yuan, thin large slices are at 185 yuan, and mixed grades are at 130-140 yuan. Jian mushrooms are firm, with high-quality mushrooms at 120 yuan and medium grades around 100 yuan. The market is definitely not going to fall back down.</p>

<p>(Artificial Silk Sales Difficult to Maintain) Yesterday, only the local silk factory bought 28 cases of Hong Jinzhong, Shuang Liu, Hai Hai, and San Qi brands of spot and futures, priced from 178.75 yuan to 161.75 yuan net. (Shanghai's Silk Sales Show Increased Quietness) New York and other ports have suffered damage from hurricanes and floods, making it difficult for silk factories to work. Silk sales have become more lifeless, with no silk telegrams being sent. The market is quiet. Yesterday afternoon, although there were negotiations with a French firm, a deal could not be reached due to a disagreement over price, so only telegrams were sent, and the deal is pending. Yesterday, only Da Chang bought 20 bales of white dry warp, with prices remaining flat and weak.</p>

New lead wire, sizes 16 to 20, was still offered, purchased by local glass shops, with no price changes. Enamel factories purchased 3-400 piculs of 18-sheet black iron sheet at 11.785 yuan. Panel factories purchased 2-300 sheets of 2.5% English steel plate, with prices at 10.05 yuan and 8.45 yuan for 0.5%. Printing houses bought 200 bars of green lead at 16.5 yuan.

<h3 id="e239">Distinguishing True and False American Ginseng, by Cheng Lixing <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>American ginseng is produced in America, and its properties nourish yin and reduce fire. It is particularly effective for treating conditions such as deficiency fire toothache, yin deficiency, and consumptive cough. It is divided into two types: hairy and smooth (i.e., with skin and without skin). The skinless type is called "smooth ginseng" or "front ginseng." It is prized for its white color, light weight, loose texture, and fragrant aroma. Its head is round and square, its body is thick, and its tip is thin and pointed (branches vary greatly in size, and 300 branches are considered moderate for consumption). The surface near the head has deep, dense horizontal lines. It has many short, fat, forked branches. Its taste is initially bitter when chewed, but gradually turns sweet after a moment. This is the superior grade. In recent years, American merchants have increasingly filled the market with fake goods, so a type with the skin left on (i.e., hairy ginseng) has become more common. Its texture, shape, properties, and taste are the same as smooth ginseng, but it has an additional layer of deep, wrinkled yellow-gray skin. Because it is difficult to fake, many buyers prefer it.</p>
<p>American ginseng is expensive, costing 80-90 yuan per catty. Fake ginseng has emerged, created by removing the skin from Japanese ginseng through elaborate processes to make its appearance similar to real ginseng. People from a certain country have specifically established factories to manufacture it, hoping to deceive buyers. Unscrupulous Chinese merchants, tempted by its cheap price of only about 10 yuan per catty, sell it to harm their compatriots. The properties of Eastern and Western ginseng are opposite. Eastern ginseng boosts qi and promotes fire, causing dryness of the mouth and a red face, eventually leading to coughing blood and damaging the body. Fake American ginseng is called "fake smooth" or "competing smooth," also known as "horizontal stripes." Its color is dull white with a slight yellow tint. Its texture is hard and solid, its branches are long and thin with no distinction between thick and thin, and it has no short, fat, forked branches. Both ends are flat and bald. Although it has some stripes, they are very sparse and shallow. Its shape is withered, its aroma is sour, its taste is weak and slightly bitter with astringency, and some have a sticky feeling on the tongue. After chewing a few times, it has no taste.</p>
<p>American ginseng slices are even more difficult to distinguish due to being cut into extremely thin pieces. The real ones are finely glutinous and have a chrysanthemum pattern in the center, but they are often mixed with fake slices. Buyers often try to distinguish them by tasting their bitterness, but monks often soak them in quinine or gentian water before cutting, making them bitter, so this is not a reliable way to distinguish them.</p>
<p>More recently, there are also names such as "cut mouth," "broken tail," "large tail," "medium tail," "thin tail," and "American ginseng whiskers," priced around one yuan per tael, deceptively named "eating embryos" to cater to customers looking for cheap deals. Even experts find it difficult to distinguish these types of goods, so buyers should be even more cautious.</p>

<h3 id="e240">On Gentlemen - Preface to Qian <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>Whenever one mentions "gentleman," we are reminded of (Flowers in the Mirror). Although it is explicitly presented as (Flowers in the Mirror), it also contains many profound allegorical meanings. However, its description of the (Country of Gentlemen) depicts the so-called (gentlemen) as excessively (humble and yielding). For example, when two people walk towards each other, neither wants to give way first, and they must lean aside to let the other person pass first. The other person also leans aside in the same way, being humble and polite. As a result, a lot of nonsense is spoken, and some even turn around in anger, willing to take a detour. There are also merchants who are willing to give away their goods regardless of their cost... This is clearly a (hypocritical) depiction, which loses the essence of (allegory).</p>
<p>There are also various different interpretations of (gentleman). Generally, it is considered to be the opposite of (petty person). (Conduct must follow propriety, and words and actions must conform to righteousness) is the general (view of a gentleman). However, there is no absolute definition of this (propriety) and this (righteousness). All good words such as loyalty, filial piety, integrity, trustworthiness, fairness, uprightness, amiability, and humility are generally possessed by (gentlemen) and can earn people's respect. However, unfortunately, the behavior of (gentlemen), which has been passed down for thousands of years until today, has been denounced as (man-eating old ethics) and is to be overthrown. However, there are also people who are simultaneously calling for the promotion and preservation of our country's (inherent virtues).</p>
<p>Whether the (old ethics) should be preserved or overthrown is something I have absolutely no preconceived notions about. According to Mr. Wang Jingzhi's interpretation, the so-called (gentleman) of ancient times should be understood as (upper-class person). In his annotation of (The Ospreys) in (Selected Annotations of the Book of Songs), he states: (Gentleman is an aristocratic class, with titles and power, and a very high social status. It is the ideal figure in the minds of women at that time. The interpretation of gentleman as the opposite of petty person is a mistake...). His reason for interpreting it as (upper-class person) (aristocratic class) is that (gentleman) can be interpreted as (son of the monarch).</p>
<p>However, there are also people who interpret (gentleman) as (scoundrel bastard). This must be attributed to Mr. Wei Jiangong's boldness and frankness in the thirty-eighth issue of (Yu Si). I have copied his original text of (Wei Feng Cutting Sandalwood) below:</p>
<p>Original text of the Book of Songs: (They chop the sandalwood, and pile it on the river bank. The river water is clear and rippling. They do not sow, they do not reap, yet whence comes the grain three hundred sheaves? They do not hunt, they do not fish, yet why do we see badgers hanging in your courtyard? Those (gentlemen), they do not eat for nothing!)</p>
<p>Mr. Wei's interpretation: (The sandalwood is chopped bare, the logs are stacked on the riverbank; the river water ripples clearly. They don't farm, they don't till the land, so why do they get 300 shi of grain for nothing? They don't net or hunt, so why do you see foxes, rabbits, sables, and wolves hanging in your yard? Alas! Those (scoundrel bastards) can't eat without side dishes!)</p>
<p>We don't need to criticize his interpretation, just his humorous and satirical writing style is already worthy of appreciation. And the so-called (gentleman) has really suffered enough.</p>
<p>Ruan Ji of the early Jin Dynasty seems to have been a thinker who advocated naturalism. He greatly admired freedom, but the so-called (gentlemen) of that time did not allow him freedom. He despised the hypocritical rites and laws, and the (scholars of rites and laws) hated him like an enemy. Therefore, he could only spend his remaining years with poetry and wine, and vent his sorrow with weeping. The (gentlemen) of that time once disdainfully ridiculed him as a (mad slave). The (scholars of rites and laws) of that time were very arrogant.</p>
<p>However, in the present, whether the (gentleman) refers to (upper-class person) (aristocratic class) or (scoundrel bastard), it is absolutely of no benefit to today's society. This can be asserted. Even if it refers to the so-called (object of petty people) (a legacy of thousands of years), in today's China, where the people are poor and buying is difficult, the economy is bankrupt in the countryside, and the society is full of unemployment, it is at least not necessary.</p>
<p>Therefore, (gentleman), if it is not immediately... [text missing] displayed in the inner tree.</p>

<p>(My love! Let me leave you, let me forever...)</p>
<p>Ah, ah! It is already such a desolate autumn moonlit night, why must the violin of that Russian girl across the way still emit such heartbreaking sounds?</p>
<p>I am familiar with this tune, and it is the only tune I am familiar with. However, for five years, I have never sung it once, because it is too stimulating. As soon as it starts, it pulls me back to the most painful place, making me shed a few more futile tears for the past dreams. I once smashed my violin, I once declined a friend who studied music, I was always on guard, afraid of triggering the sound of this tune. Although I cannot erase the musical score engraved in my brain.</p>
<p>Ah, ah! I want to forget, forget that tragic scene. I am afraid to hear, to hear this mournful sound!</p>
<p>You, you young Russian girl, why don't you play the joyful tune you played the night before last, but on this already desolate autumn moonlit night, play such heartbreaking sounds? What sorrow do you have that you must do this? Aren't you afraid of hurting yourself, but you must know that you have unknowingly pulled me back to the most painful past...</p>
<p>(What? Even the epiphyllum doesn't wither so quickly, does it?)</p>
<p>I clearly remember that five years ago, in the X X Middle School campus covered in faint moonlight, I said these words to her for the last time, with tears in my eyes. It had the form of a question, but there was absolutely no sense of questioning. When I spoke, I just hung my head helplessly... I clearly remember that she seemed to want to say something, but suddenly stood up, shook off my hand, and walked straight away... I also clearly remember how she lay prostrate on the back of another chair, how her back was twitching, but when I chased after her, she suddenly stood up again and went back to the dormitory... I also remember how I braved the wind and dew and stood foolishly in the campus until dawn...</p>
<p>What was correct about the reasons she said in her letters and in person? She didn't say she had changed her mind, but said it was for my sake! She said that the short half-year of love had caused me great loss. She said she was afraid that I would exhaust my ambitions for her sake. She said that I had neglected my studies in the past half year, she said that I had alienated comrades and friends in the past half year, she blamed me for forgetting the great responsibility? (Society is in such urgent need of transformation, which is felt by all young people with a brain. We should do our best to shoulder our responsibilities.) This is the language of her letter. She said we can no longer indulge in love. She said she was leaving, and she was leaving me...</p>
<p>She didn't reply to a single word of my letter. In my letter, I said she was too cold. What's wrong with falling in love passionately when we are young? The great responsibility can be shouldered in the future. I swear that I am not a weak-willed youth, and I will never fail her expectations, but I can never give up the right to love immediately... I remember that my letter paper was stained with tears, I wanted to break her determination... Because of this, she didn't reply a single word. The exam was approaching, and the third day was the holiday. But she still ignored me. Is she really leaving? I was so anxious that my head was about to explode. In the classroom, I always kept my eyes on her, but she didn't even look at me. Her face was pale and serious, which made me have to give up.</p>
<p>The music teacher announced the method of the music exam. Everyone sings a song alone. Singing is fine, singing the score is also fine. The eighth in line was her. She walked to the piano, facing me. I lay on the desk and dared not look up; just concentrating on listening to her beautiful singing voice, for the last time, ah, ah, this is the last time!</p>
<p>She sang, and the score she sang, the first sentence stabbed into my heart. I remember the lyrics that match this score are like this:</p>
<p>My love! Let me leave you.</p>
<p>Let me leave you forever!</p>
<p>It's not that my heart is hard, it's really for your sake.</p>
<p>If we continue to entangle, you will have a great sacrifice.</p>
<p>I don't want you to sacrifice for me, it's better to separate from you.</p>
<p>This is my painful proposition, and I ask you to forgive me.</p>
<p>My love! The more I love you, the more I can't help but leave you!</p>
<p>When the aftersound faded away, I raised my head and saw her slightly moist eyes fixed on me, but as soon as they touched my eyes, she suddenly lowered her head and returned to her seat...</p>
<p>This is the scene of my departure from her. For five years, I have never seen her again. Only this sad song remains in my heart as a souvenir. But, I want to gradually forget this song, forget this scene, I am always on guard, not letting it reappear... But tonight, you Russian girl! Why do you let your violin play such a song to touch my hidden pain? On such a desolate autumn moonlit night...</p>
<h3 id="e242">Sports Champion - Jian Yin <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>X X Academy is a famous university in Shanghai, with many students. Among them is a ball player named Li, nicknamed (Black-Faced Tiger). Of course, his face can't be white. Because he is very brave, people gave him the name of a tiger. This (Black-Faced Tiger) is only twenty years old, and his body is already tall enough to rival a foreigner. However, although he is a sports champion, it is a pity that he doesn't even recognize a hundred Chinese characters. As for a few common terms on the playing field, he still recognizes them, such as (left wing) (right wing) (charge). He is also a layman when it comes to English, only recognizing a few words such as (Ball') (out Side') (Pass). It can be seen that his Chinese and English level is quite amazing, let alone that he is a top student of the university.</p>
<p>The reason why this X X Academy is so famous at home and abroad is because it is famous for playing ball. Therefore, the (Black-Faced Tiger)'s contribution is not small. The president greatly appreciated him, the professors were very fond of him, and the students admired him even more. Needless to say, everyone dared not offend him. If a student or doorman was disrespectful to him, he would report it immediately, and an expulsion order would be issued.</p>
<p>From the beginning of school to the holiday, the (Black-Faced Tiger) has not attended class for a single day, but his scores in each subject are always in the seventies and eighties. Undoubtedly, this is because the professors are fond of him, so without any exams, they gave him a passing grade first. So he doesn't have to go to school, and spends all day</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>loitering in coffee shops, movie theaters, and swimming pools. All expenses are paid by the school's accounting office. Not only that, the (Black-Faced Tiger)'s clothes are all provided by the school, and tuition and miscellaneous fees are of course waived.</p>
<p>When the ball game arrived, the (Black-Faced Tiger) got into a car and arrived at the ball field amidst the cheers of thousands of people, ready to compete. Fortunately, his soccer skills were good, so he always had the upper hand and returned victorious. After returning, he ate a big meal of champagne, agar, and chewing gum. All expenses were provided by the school.</p>
<p>Hearing that a certain sports meeting was about to begin, the (Black-Faced Tiger) had to trouble his jade feet to grace the occasion again. So he returned with silver shields and silver cups, which made the (Black-Faced Tiger) happy enough to turn into a (Smiling Tiger)! What he eats, lives, and wears can be said to be (aristocratic). He said to people: (My success all depends on my two feet. With my two feet, I can enjoy glory and happiness for a lifetime!) Time flew by day by day, and the (Black-Faced Tiger)'s graduation period arrived. But the president retained him and told him not to graduate, but to be a long-term ball player at the school. And he paid him XX yuan a month. The (Black-Faced Tiger) agreed without hesitation. From then on, he got even further away from books. The dignified university graduate still can't understand ordinary family letters. His level has reached the extreme!</p>
<p>Soon, the (Black-Faced Tiger)'s bad luck came. It was a quiet morning. He was wearing a sports vest and running on the sports field, when he suddenly slipped and fell. With this fall, the (Black-Faced Tiger)'s life's work came to an end! Because he was running too fast, his leg was badly injured. Although treated by famous doctors, he inevitably became a light (cripple). Therefore, the (Black-Faced Tiger)'s nickname was changed to (Lame Tiger). Because he could no longer compete with others, the president stopped his salary and issued an eviction order. In a desperate situation, he returned to his hometown and, recalling his former fame, couldn't help but cry out loud!</p>
<p>He is over twenty years old. He thought his (omnipotent) two feet were no longer effective. But he had to eat, and he needed a job. He had to seek work in all directions, but what skills did he have? Would society tolerate this ignorant person? At this time, he was extremely regretful. He wanted to strive, but he had no way to strive. So the once glorious sports champion (Black-Faced Tiger) the ball player, fell into poverty for the rest of his life!</p>

<p>Recently, at the invitation of a friend, I attended a symposium for factory management colleagues. This is a group that studies all issues related to factory management. First, the colleagues present gave their opinions in turn, and then everyone discussed them. The speech given by Mr. Li, who has been a manager for more than ten years, is worth recording. He said: (Brothers have been working as managers for more than ten years. I feel that because of the changes of the times in the past ten years, our methods of managing workers have also changed to suit the times and trends. That is to replace (violent suppression) with (rational guidance). For example, if two workers are fighting in the factory and come to you to tell you, twisted into a ball. Ten years ago, if you put on a very stern face and shouted (both parties are not allowed to fight), and then suppressed them with the words (if you fight again in the future, both of you will be fired at the same time), you could scare away the opinions of the two people. But if it is now, the above method is not applicable. Because their knowledge and understanding have improved. If the two of them argue and come to you to ask you to judge, if you don't use a reasonable method of mediation and only use power to suppress them, not only will you not be able to eliminate their opinions, but they will also think that you are an irrational person and will not obey your command at the same time...)</p>
<p>Indeed, the times are changing day by day. Not only must the methods of managing workers suit the times and trends, but in fact, why shouldn't those who are people's leaders suit the times and trends? In the past, the emperor was the people's leader. The emperor was noble above all else, and his power shook the four directions. In addition, he held the military and political power in his hands. The common people could not even hear the news. He also created the intimidating saying (the monarch wants the minister to die, and the minister has to die) to prevent reactionaries and to suppress them. It was certainly able to be powerful for a while, but in the end it could not resist the changes of the times and the influx of trends and collapsed. In modern times, the people's knowledge has improved, and they have also realized their own mission. At this time, if those who are people's leaders still do not do some practical work that benefits the masses and continue to use power to suppress them indiscriminately, not only will they not gain the people's trust, but their collapse will be imminent.</p>
<p>Because now is the era of (those who follow the people survive) and (those who go against the people perish). Power cannot be suppressed.</p>

<p>Orderly: Look, you're biting me again. I mean, with this kind of good opportunity, it's just... just..., it's not like we have to wait for the Japanese soldiers to come before we escape. Now I'm just asking you, if we take advantage of everyone's panic and try to get a few more valuable things, wouldn't that be better?</p>
<p>Maid: Wrong, wrong. But Xiao Wang, I'm telling you, the Japanese soldiers won't attack Beijing. They've already talked it over. Don't dream. This morning I even heard the Madam ask the Master: (Should we go to Shanghai to take refuge?): The Master said: (I already have a plan. China and Japan are already negotiating peace, and Beijing will soon have peace and tranquility. What are you afraid of?) From this point of view, the Master doesn't plan to escape, so we have no hope.</p>
<p>Orderly: Then Madam's diamond ring and things like that, you can get a few more, right?</p>
<p>Maid: That's not necessarily the case. The week before last, when a Japanese plane was discovered here, didn't the Madam take a large box of jewelry and deposit it in a foreign bank? Don't you remember? You went with her that day. You should know where it was sent.</p>

<p>Orderly: No, the Master will scold you when he comes down later.</p>
<p>Young Master: Don't be afraid, Papa won't come. Just now he chased me out, locked the door, and went to take a nap with the Auntie. Where's the pai gow? Go get it quickly.</p>
<p>Orderly: I don't know where it is either. The cooks probably took it.</p>
<p>Young Master: What, they're gambling too? Later I'll tell Papa and have them all kicked out.</p>
<p>Orderly: Look, you're getting your young master's temper again. Can you gamble, but they can't?</p>
<p>Young Master: Of course. What are they? Papa said it. When I grow up, I'm going to be the commander-in-chief, so I have to learn how to manage people now. (Leading troops is the same as managing people), Papa said (if you manage people so that they listen like sheep, then you'll be able to lead troops in the future.)</p>
<p>Orderly: Oh! The Young Master is really a promising person. At such a young age, he can say such profound things.</p>
<p>Young Master: Then since there's no pai gow, let's play poker then. Didn't I buy a new deck of poker yesterday that's on you?</p>
<p>Orderly: (Taking out a deck of poker from his body) The cards are here, but I don't have any money on me.</p>

<p>Young Master: Bah! Nonsense, I didn't win your money. Here, I'll give you a few more dollars, take it. (He handed a handful of banknotes to the orderly, who accepted them with a smile. They played poker.)</p>

<h3 id="e246">The Disappearance of the US Film Industry's Overseas Market and How to Break Through the Current Crisis <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Yan Zhi</p>
<p>In the era of silent films, the overseas market of the US film industry, especially Europe, was very popular. The production costs of each of their films could be recovered domestically, and the income from overseas markets could reach four-tenths of the total income. By the time of sound films, the overseas market gradually disappeared, because different dialects made stagnation an unavoidable phenomenon. The American film industry has exhausted various strategies in order to regain the lost market. For example, hiring famous European actors to make movies in order to appeal to European audiences, making each film in various language versions in addition to English, or establishing photography studios in Europe to produce films that cater to the psychology of Europeans, can be said to have exhausted all the methods that human intelligence can reach. However, as a result, the European territory is still shrinking day by day. The reasons for this, if explained in detail, would be too lengthy. Now, I will only extract the main points and describe them as follows:</p>
<p>In the current situation, Germany, France, England, Italy, and other European countries all have plans to protect their domestic films. Moreover, under the rule of Mussolini, who advocated nationalism, and Hitler, who ruled Germany, American films naturally have to endure extra heavy pressure. In Hitler's anti-Jewish movement, Jewish Americans were driven out of the country, so the American film industry, in which Jews held the reins, had no hope of assistance. Just look! The branch office established by Paramount in Germany in the past has now been closed and returned to the country. To put it bluntly, in the future, American films may no longer have the opportunity to be publicly screened on German screens (during Hitler's rule).</p>
<p>In addition, photography studios and cinemas established in France and England have also closed due to economic failures. In short, at present, the overseas market of the American film industry is only in British colonies and South America, as well as East Asian countries. Therefore, the total overseas income of the American film industry is only one-third of what it used to be.</p>
<p>In terms of the national character of Europeans, not to mention political restrictions, they are definitely unwilling to spend money to watch films spoken in foreign languages. Therefore, the first so-called countermeasure to break through the crisis is to add foreign language versions. However, this is not easy. Each of their films costs at least 8,000 to 15,000 US dollars. Therefore, at this time, they no longer add foreign language versions except for special works.</p>
<p>Secondly, they feel that the overseas market is disappearing and domestic income is decreasing. From a passive perspective, they can only lay off staff and save expenses. This level is quite strict. For example, Paramount Company has implemented an annual reduction of 2 million US dollars in staff salaries. In addition, there are reductions in production costs and shortening of production time. In the past, an ordinary film would take four to five weeks, but now it is shortened to less than three weeks.</p>
<p>In other aspects, for those who are engaged in screen work, if their luck fades slightly, regardless of whether they are past stars, they are all in the ranks of being discarded. On the one hand, they are doing their best to discover and cultivate new stars, because new stars are cheap and their expenses can be saved.</p>
<p>In short, the American film industry is now working hard, desperately, and fighting this crisis. If, unfortunately, this situation continues for a few more years, then their future is hopeless.</p>
<p>Audience Opinions</p>
<h3 id="e247">My Critique (Sister's Tragedy) <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Tao</p>
<p>Previously, this publication carried Li Renjun's rigorous critique of Hu Ping's screenplay and performance in (Sister's Tragedy), focusing on the film's content and ideas. Now, I offer some additional points.</p>
<p>The story of this film itself is too simple and ordinary; moreover, it is quite unrealistic. For example, the (correction of revenge ideology) and the (inspiration of revolutionary will) are precisely contrary to the film's content. The Ying siblings' assassination of young master Wang is purely an individualistic act of revenge. As Mr. Li commented, this method of assassination leads nowhere. How can it be considered a correction? The director did not contribute much to this film, except for an exaggerated depiction of Shanghai when the father and daughter return home at the beginning, foreshadowing their future return.</p>
<p>At the beginning, I didn't think it was very good that Zheng Xiaoqiu, playing the younger brother, climbed a tree to watch something. Firstly, because Xiaoqiu is so fat, and secondly, a younger brother of that age should, according to family customs, be engaged in farming work, not idly climbing trees to play.</p>
<p>Also, I don't quite understand the reason for the daughter going to Shanghai to play with her father. Considering how poor and busy their family is, would they have so much free time and money to play in Shanghai?</p>
<h3 id="e248">Critique of (Sister's Tragedy) <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>(Omitted above) The beginning of this story reveals the bankruptcy of the countryside. The subject matter is certainly pleasing, but after the younger brother is arrested, it develops in a distorted way. The gratuitous insertion of a four-way love triangle and the ensuing jealousy also seem too cumbersome. Especially the ending, with the landlord's son being assassinated to complete the play, inevitably falls into a quagmire of fantasy, almost turning this tragedy, filled with grief and indignation, into a comedy.</p>
<p>It is contradictory that the countryside, already squeezed to the point of requesting rent reduction from the landlord, returns disappointed but brings back many foreign cloths from the city. Using this method to explain the causes of the countryside, in order to make the audience understand, is a clumsy move. Also, the subtitles tell us that Mo Xin is a poor boy, so how can his father order the (Accounting Office) to remit four hundred yuan to provide him with reference books? This is also a point that makes us doubtful. In terms of the actors, I think Hu Ping and Wang Mengshi performed the best. There seems to be some change, which is what the theme of the play dictates. Otherwise, the story would be loose and weak. Her face, filled with sorrow and indignation and brimming with murderous intent, is her outstanding feature. From his appearance to his drowning in the river, Wang Mengshi consistently conveyed solemn and genuine emotions. He is the best of the supporting actors. Gong Jianong did not leave us with a special impression because he appeared very little. Wang Xianzai and Wang Weixin performed mediocrely. Gu Meijun's expressions were too forced, Zheng Xiaoqiu's movements lacked realism, and he had virtually no facial expressions.</p>

<p>(Harvest), written and directed by Li Pingqian of the Star Film Company, is a work that Mr. Li has put painstaking effort into. It is also a film that the Star Film Company highly values in 1933. Last month, Mr. Li led a large group of people to Suzhou countryside to shoot location scenes. Recently, it has been filmed in Shanghai. Li Pingqian, Nv Xia, Gao Qianping, etc., have all become dark-skinned and no longer have their former charm. Xu Yuan and the other actor, because they played rural farmers,</p>

<p>— Xi Yan</p>
<p>After her husband Paul Bern committed suicide, blonde actress Keene Harlo was once inconsolable, but insiders all said she would soon find a suitable husband and remarry. Today, Hollywood news reports that Keene Harlo flew to Yuma, Arizona, last night (the 18th) to marry Harold G. Rossen, a famous Hollywood photographer. The wedding took place at 4:30 this morning. The officiant was the governor of Yuma. After the wedding, Keene Harlo immediately flew back to Hollywood. Arriving at 7:00, she immediately entered the studio to continue working. It can be said that it was very hasty. As for the groom's past, we know very little, but we know that he is a photographer, 38 years old, and participated in the war during the European War.</p>
<p>And also shaved off a circle of hair, leaving only a bird's nest-like tuft in the middle, a strange and grotesque appearance that makes people sick, truly like a general African native from the tropics.</p>
<h3 id="e251">(Young China) Preparations Busy <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>Bu Wancang of the Lianhua First Factory is very busy preparing for the filming of (Young China), which will begin shooting soon. This play was originally compiled at the same time as (The Light of Motherhood), but because this play has heavy content and every role is extremely important, it is necessary to conduct meticulous research and have ample time to plan everything. Therefore, for careful consideration and to strive for excellence, (The Light of Motherhood) was filmed first. During the filming of (The Light of Motherhood) and in the past two months, Director Bu has been racking his brains over the content of this play and the various roles. The script has now been approved by the script review committee, so the public eagerly anticipates Director Bu's work following (The Light of Motherhood), and it is expected to be filmed in the near future.</p>
<h3 id="e252">(Song of the Fishermen) Content Scrutinized <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>The Lianhua Second Factory recently hired five cars, led by Director Cai Chusheng, and took Yuan Congmei, Shang Guanwu, and many other actors to Jing'an Temple Road and Avenue Joffre to film location scenes for (Song of the Fishermen). The reason why everyone went on this trip and hired these cars was just to film a scene where He Renzhai came to Shanghai and Liang Yuezhou picked him up after arriving at the pier and passed through the bustling city. The length was only about ten feet, but the artists, who are by no means sloppy, were unwilling to be perfunctory with this short scene. In addition to one car for installing the camera and carrying the two leading actors, three cars were filled with luggage following behind. The last car was for the crew members and workers to sit in. The time wasted included half an hour to install the camera on the car, and an hour and a half to scout for suitable backgrounds along the road. However, in the end, only two short shots were taken for selection. Such meticulousness and the expenditure of so much material resources and time will only be fleeting in the eyes of the audience on the screen in the future.</p>

<p>Hong Shen has not directed plays at the Star Film Company for several years. This time, he was inspired and directed a play starring Wang Ying, Chen Ningqiu, and Wang Zhengxin, (Record of Tears of Blood on Iron Plates). The film takes the Sichuan peasants' resistance to landlords as its theme, and the directorial technique uses a hard-line style throughout. It can be said to be a unique production among domestic films. The film was previously sent to Beijing for inspection. Because there were several extremely慷慨激昂scenes in the film, there were rumors that the entire film would be cut. Now the film has passed the review. Except for the one-hour scene where Chen Ningqiu kills Xie Xueqing, the entire film remains intact and will soon be seen by audiences at the New Guangda Theater.</p>

<p>Imagine Jacques Okai with a beard, wearing a crisp suit, a bright red flower in his chest, and a spritz of perfume. What would you think when he appeared?</p>
<p>But he is really like this now! He recently built a new house on Beverly Hills. Those magazine reporters who loudly shouted, "Hey! Okai!" have changed their tone from today and are very carefully shouting, "Mr. Okai, are you home?"</p>
<p>The most surprising thing is his bedroom, with a pink carpet on the floor, a thin silk umbrella hanging on the lampshade, and soft cushions on the sofa... Okai's home has also become like this!</p>
<p>"Really, everything has changed!" One day, a friend who came to visit him exclaimed when he saw him. But Okai's answer was this: "After acting in comedies for five years, I don't feel any interest at all. On the contrary, newcomers like George Raft have changed their style before me. I am really tired of smiling. Smiling non-stop for five years is something only a fool would do, and it's beyond what ordinary people can imagine!"</p>
<p>Once, at a banquet, Okai was talking to Steele Edwin when the lovely Blondell suddenly walked past. Okai couldn't help but shout, "Hey!" "It's useless how much you boast, in the end, you're just the usual you!" Steele said to him with a sneer from the side.</p>

<p>— Yuan Congmei</p>
<p>Hooves! Horns! Cannon 1! The streets of the soldiers, crowded like ants; fleeing! chaos! Crowding over here, and crowding over there... This is the scene of war! Civil war.</p>
<p>Old Ye and Mantis Gan walked through the market and saw the scene of moving and evacuation to escape the disaster, scrambling to flee. They were a little confused. Later, after asking, they learned that Governor Gou and Commander Wei were at war again and were about to fight here.</p>
<p>Old Ye had always had heart problems. Suddenly, he was strongly stimulated, and his expression changed drastically. He immediately fainted on the ground. Mantis Gan was busy saving him, and soon Zhao Lishi also came. Everyone was busy and in a hurry, and Mantis Gan ran to find Granny Ye. She brought Yu'er and Zhu'er, pushed through the crowd, and saw that Old Ye was unconscious, so she put Yu'er down, leaned over Old Ye, shaking him and shouting, "Zhu'er's father!" Her voice was very sad and trembling! Granny Ye was anxious and cried, pushing Old Ye, shouting at him with all her might, but he had parted ways with the world!</p>
<p>More and more spectators surrounded them, layer upon layer. Alas! It really is the so-called blessings never come in pairs, misfortunes never come singly. Just when Granny Ye was feeling the pain of loss, who knew that Yu'er was kidnapped again!</p>
<p>Granny Ye was really anxious. "Where's Yu'er?..." Her cries pierced everyone's hearts like needles. "Where's Yu'er? My Yu'er?"</p>
<p>She screamed wildly! Cried sadly! She scurried through the crowd like a wounded wild dog. She... she finally fainted on Old Ye's corpse.</p>
<p>★★★★★</p>
<p>The mask of the god of war is unveiled!</p>
<p>Shells fly... cavalry rushes... hand-to-hand combat... charge... burning... looting... another act of self-destruction! Warlords compete for territory, and ordinary people abandon their homes.</p>
<p>The train was occupied by refugees, including the car body and the roof. Poor Granny Ye also had to flee with them. But her inner pain was enough to bear. She felt the exchange of blood and tears!</p>
<p>Zhao Lishi, Mantis Gan, his fat wife, skinny old man, seller of stinky tofu... were all found on this roof. The fat woman was very fierce, her vicious mouth never stopped, cursing the war. Zhao Lishi looked dejected and remained silent.</p>
<p>Later, Granny Ye and others arrived in the slum area near the Shanghai North Railway Station. Some of these places were extremely dirty, with only sewage and... But Granny Ye, she was determined to create her life in these places! (To be continued)</p>
