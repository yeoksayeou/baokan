<p>時　評</p>
<h3>國營鋼鐵之籌辦</h3>
<p>— 傎</p>
<p>國營鋼鐵廠問題。在我國國内提倡已久。實業部前曾與德商喜望。孟阿恩。麥迪。等三公司。擬定開辦合同。近鑒於當前情勢之需要。已於十二月十五日在首都參謀本部會商討論。十八日又在京續商「開工事宜。選用機器。資本額數及合同草案。」聞其地點亦已選定在蕪湖與當塗附近傍近揚子江邊。以其運輸與消售比較方便也。凖是以言。鋼鐵廠已勢在必辦。不過我國今日不經營重工業則已。經營重工業。則其方針。均不能以推廣消售開拓市塲爲經營之鵠的。蓋自世界經濟恐慌發生之後。舉凡大工業國家。其重工業愈發達者。即其所感受恐慌之影響亦愈甚。如美國製鋼鐵工業。現在繼續開工者。不過其生産設備上二分之一而已。且其出品價極便宜。較之一九二九年低落三之一以下。我國今日新設工廠。工人旣非熟手。設備容有未週。所出貨品。在市場必難與彼爭一日之短長。無已。惟有另闢途徑。着眼於國防計劃。不問市場關係。不計一般需要。而專注力於生産工具之生産建設。庶乎其可以經營也。</p>
<p>吾人不憶「滿冶萍廠鑛」之往事乎。漢冶萍廠鑛。除萍鄕煤鑛遠在江西之萍鄕外。其大冶之鐵鑛。産地甚近。且鑛由豐富。所含鐵量之精。世罕其匹。然而竟失敗者何哉。第一受外貨輸入之影響。在本國無適當之消場。出品價格又較舶來品爲高。以致一般人均購外貨。第二經營上之失策。漢冶萍以前雖名爲官商合辦。實際乃等於官辦。一切官廳機關所有之弊端。漢冶萍無不有之。無謂之消耗大。難爲合理之經營。第三受借外債之制限。其鑛石及出品。皆須以低價儘先售與日廠。有此三因。該廠自身。固深陷於無法自振之境。而我國僅有之重工業。亦因而不易展開矣。</p>
<p>就一般工業發展之程序上言之。我國雖尙在輕工業發展之初期。然使世界市塲競爭不如是之烈。國内環境不阻碍經濟之進展者。則重工業之經營。亦未嘗不可逐漸推進。惟在今日情勢之下。而欲就純粹之經濟立塲。以從事重工業之開展。前途難有希望。故吾以爲今日祇有從國防上着眼。方可以戰勝上述之困難。而另闢一新路向。因國防之建設。爲純粹的消費。絕不能計及經營上之虧折與否。且今日我國所最應着力建設者。不必在砲壘之添築。軍艦之建造。種種直接之軍事用具。而在生産工具之生産。交通建設之發達。與夫一般國民經濟之重建。夫我國工業之漸有進境。殆已爲不可否定事實。設使政府能給與適當之扶助。則前途之發展可期。目前交通工業。已爲一般所集注。惟政府所奬掖者爲汽車交通。似於任重致遠之效能猶小。若欲圖國力之眞正發達。國防之鞏固。軍事運用之靈便。則非敷設鐵道不爲功。興築鐵道而果有决心。則一切鋼鐵材料。應由國營鋼鐵廠供給。自屬當然。而鋼鐵廠經營之前途。可以無憂矣。但尙有一似小而實大之事焉。在歐美諸國可不必顧慮者。在我國則應十分注意。即防止鋼鐵廠經營之官僚化腐化是也。此種新興事業。負將來國防之大任。開國民經營之先基。必一錢一物。及一滴鐵水。一片鐵塊之處置。與一職員一伕役之任用。均須一致合理化。絕無絲毫浪費與苟且。然後可以見信於國人。樹此大工業之基礎也。</p>

<p>（東京）　拓務省對滿鐵與關東軍所作成之改組案、第一步絕對反對、第二步如有改組之必要、應由拓務省獨自提出改組案、以兩步之戰法對抗之、大藏省方面對於根本改革、亦持反對之意、與支持現地案之陸軍難免不發生正面衝突、其影響勢必波及政局、此時正注意荒木陸相之態度、陸相　五相會議及内政會議以來、支持齋藤内閣之信念已有變更、認爲無維持之必要、故對此滿鐵改組案縱加以多少之修正、大部分必承認原案、超越現内閣之運命而勇往邁進、以謀案之實現、（二十日電通電）</p>

<h3>沙立斯堡侯爵提出英貴族院改革案</h3>
<p>減少議員名額增加箝制下院權力</p>
<p>預防工黨握政權後實行劇烈變更</p>
<p>（倫敦）　上院今日開會、出席者極多、沙立斯堡侯爵提出改革上院之私人議案、主張縮減上院議員之名額、及增大上院延緩立法案之權力、海相海爾珊代表政府答覆、謂此案應儘先討論、但工黨領袖彭森璧謂、此案削減世襲貴族之名額、直限制皇室特權、宜先向英皇請示、然後進行此案云、自由黨李定侯爵亦以此案確將限制皇室特權爲言、經衆討論後、上院准提案人沙立斯堡侯爵說明理由、</p>
<p>沙侯爵起稱、上院應爲國家謀取保護方法、以防前工黨政府下不幸事件之復作、工黨議員克利浦前曾有言、下屆工黨政府將取締上院、故上院對此、尤不能不預爲之防、渠僅提議上院組織中之變更、務求臻於安全、凡非必要者槪不涉及、此案可使上院有充分權力、以免國家不及有從容考慮之時間、遽陷於大改革之紊亂中、此案並不欲取銷一九一一年國會法、此案承認憲法所規定財政權屬諸下院、及最後治權屬諸人民之原則、但下院所通過之財政案或其他立法案、或僅爲國會中多數之裁判、而非爲國民之裁判、提議組織兩院混合委員會、以議長爲主席、共同確定貨幣案、而不由議長單獨爲之、上院改組後、如以絕對多數三次否决一案、則最後决定應由下屆成立之下院爲之、今兩院業已成立小組委員會、籌畫可使英國安全不受任何急促而危險的變更之提議、今之議案、即以其提議爲根據也、國外情事不可不鑒、舊有制度、現斷爲狄克推多制、或爲破裂的變更所代替、英國不可不防備自己政體發生不利改變之可能性、上院責任在改革其自已組織、以求國家安全、故上院所爲、以絕對必要爲限、此案提議將上院世襲份子大爲裁減、減至一百五十人、外加非廕襲者一百五十人、再加以皇室親貴宗敎領袖與法律大員共約三百二十人云、</p>
<p>工黨彭森璧動議、拒絕此案、指此爲政治上欺騙、希圖改變組織、利於在朝政黨、渠不信此案可爲人所重視、此案假借上院之改組、而謀牽掣將來政府、渠深信此案如果通過、則下屆選舉中許多實業界議席將爲社會黨所有云、</p>
<p>自由黨艾攝子爵稱、此案所根據者、爲顯然錯誤之原則、艾攝又言及工黨議員克利浦前所發之言論、謂上院不必以鍍金的狄克推多爲慮、而工黨領袖宜力避狄克推多之思想、因抱此思想、適自毁耳云、</p>
<p>海爾珊稱、各案皆予、一讀、此爲習慣、故渠主張此案初讀成立、但此非謂政府或渠個人贊助此案也、政府尙未考慮此案、故渠不能表示政府對此計畫之意見云、上院後以八四票對三五票贊成此案初讀、（十九日路透電）</p>

<h3>毓濟輪已無幸</h3>
<p>上海去電呼呌無應</p>
<p>江元載旅客仍未到</p>
<p>丨本日派三江運食糧前往丨</p>
<p>毓大公司之毓濟輪、在溫州洋面觸礁、船身毁損甚巨、昨日聞已發生重大危險、輪體傾斜、勢將倒沉、公司去電、且無回復、本日决派輪往觀、茲將續訊分記如下、</p>
<h3>船身危險</h3>
<p>毓濟輪船身、於十八日夜、即因海水陷没頭二艙、重量不匀、又經風浪打擊、便向一面傾斜、勢極殆危、幸乘客於是夜、駁上近江兵艦、迨至十九日、由上海公司發往探詢電報數次、據該公司負責人員言、均未得復、公司頗爲焦慮、昨午後、本埠得到消息、謂毓濟輪受風濤激盪、已不勝支持、全船有下沉之勢、且船底毁裂過甚、十九日晨全船已進水、殊無挽救希望、今日恐已沉没矣、</p>
<h3>呼電不通</h3>

<h3>江元未到</h3>
<p>江元軍艦救得一百餘旅客、送來上海、其先電告十九日夜可以抵滬、至遲二十日上午、定可進口、蓋上海距失事地Ｓholond島、不過三十小時海程、若軍艦行駛、猶可較速、今已逾時、未見到來、詢諸公司、亦稱不知、且無確切消息、或因毓濟危險而有所延滯、亦未可知、</p>
<h3>旅客逃難</h3>
<p>此次乘毓濟來滬旅客、都由福州避難而逃來上海者、故一百數十人中、携帶行李甚夥、其有全家同行者、故婦稚老弱甚多、今不幸在輪遇險、因避戰禍而遭海難、旣受物質損失、又受精神痛苦、誠屬大不幸也、</p>
<h3>貨物損失</h3>
<p>船身保有巨額水險毓大公司、可無重大損失、船内貨件、計裝橘子四千桶、橄欖六千餘桶、雖客家保險、聞祗保得六萬元、占貨額之半、橄欖浸在海水内、即使撈出、亦且變色發胖、不能出售矣、故水菓商與保險行、所受損失最大、</p>

<h3>派船運糧</h3>
<p>昨日、毓大公司與聯保公司商定、以毓濟情形、尙有幾端、迄未明瞭、决定派船往視、與毓大會商結果、業向達興公司磋商、租用三江輪船、於今日午後、從上海開往溫州洋、察看毓濟現狀、能否打撈、而公司内又因在輪船員等、糧食已盡、特已配定食物、於今午交三江徐船主代爲運去、以資接濟、據公司中人云、萬一船員不能留居毓濟船内者、有海軍楚觀艦在、當可移居艦中也、毓濟之救護、希望甚少、又本埠望賚公司、亦保有貨物險數萬元、茲亦决俟三江輪到該處察看後、再合議撈救辦法云、</p>

<h3>梁士純歐美歸來述世界二次大戰觀察</h3>
<p>謂俄日衝突勢所難免</p>
<p>我嚴守中立殆不可能</p>
<p>青年會全國恊會幹事梁士純、前次啣命往歐美考察、刻已乘胡佛總統號由美回滬、據梁氏邀游歐美、及與國外要人談話之結果、深覺各國利益上之衝突、日趨尖銳、國際間戰雲密佈、其形勢之嚴重、有過於一九一四年、照梁氏個人的推察、第二次</p>
<h3>世界大戰</h3>
<p>之爆發、將近在旦夕、梁氏蒞滬時、曾向各報社記者發表下述之談話梁氏謂、吾人如從事實方面觀察、吾人目前所處地位之險惡、爲歷史上所未有、而各國暗中從事於軍備之擴張、其鈎心鬥角之劇烈、亦遠駕一九一四年而上之、加以國家主義的勃興、世界經濟之恐慌、更足以促成二次大戰之啟幕、梁氏以爲第二次世界大戰之爆發、其地點</p>
<h3>定在遠東</h3>
<p>因近來日俄在西伯利亞、均竭力建造無商業價値的鐵道、其目的無非待戰事爆發、便於運兵至戰區而已、美國最近之承認蘇俄、雖予日本以一種極大的威脅、使戰事一時不致發生、不過此舉並不能將日俄衝突的根本原因消滅、蘇俄邇因國内建設未竣、並無戰意、但日本則反是蓋日本深恐蘇俄建設完竣後、其國勢必日强、將使日本更感不便、同時日本軍人方面、極欲</p>
<h3>與俄一戰</h3>
<p>以便早日完成其在滿洲之勢力、所以第二次大戰之爆發恐迫在眉睫矣、梁氏又謂日俄戰爭爆發後、中國應取之態度、就本人私意觀察當嚴守中立、但吾深恐嚴守中立、於事實上迨不可能耳云云、又聞梁氏曾代表中國出席第五次本平洋國交討論會、在歐美時曾晤美國國務卿赫爾·美駐歐大使台維斯·軍縮會議主席漢德生·法外長巴爾旁甘及其他國際外交要人、故經騐頗爲豐富其觀察足資吾人參考、</p>

<h3>昨晚西青女籃球兩江戰勝綠隊</h3>
<p>東南甲勝德律風</p>
<p>東南乙敗於美婦</p>
<p>丨兩江東南四戰四勝丨</p>
<p>昨晚西青籃球爲女子比賽、兩江與綠隊之戰、並無精彩、兩江賴楊森强悍、以二十比十三勝、美婦表演甚佳、以三十三比十三勝東南乙、東南甲隊自另易指導員後、球藝反覺退步、以三十三比十七勝平庸之德律風、前鋒操之過急、籃下投射、失機無算、後衛頗見慌張、徒使對手乘機進攻之機會、另兩塲紅隊以二十一比十三勝麥令、藍隊以二十四比十五勝黄隊、</p>
<h3>兩江戰勝綠隊</h3>
<p>此賽性質雖較重要、但局勢雜亂、興趣殊少、綠隊前鋒、動作呆笨、投籃技術、尤爲幼稚、後衛尙佳、兩江陳榮明略見遜色、前鋒全持楊森建功、後衛則以陳白雪最佳、交綏後、楊森卽開紀錄、綠隊卽由漢蒙特進中一球、自此雙方相持殊嚴、均少得分機會、綠隊雖勇投籃乏術、徒喚奈何、第一節成四比四平手、第一節起、兩江徐素鳳代陳榮明、楊森繼續建功、綠隊亦不稍示弱、形勢仍然平均、九比七後、陳榮明再入、但上半時已終、休息後、兩江努力進攻、綠隊亡命抵抗、雙方各無得分者甚久、繼而兩江打開生路、漸見起色、但爲時不久、潘夢石瑞霞陳洪英先後犯規罰出、故最後一節、綠隊力圖反攻、漢蒙特兩發兩中、兩江豈肯放鬆、最後掙扎、兩江以二十比十三勝、裁判始緊後鬆、且多吹毛求痴、</p>

<h3>美婦勝東南乙</h3>
<p>美婦有美妙表演、三前鋒異常聯絡、白乃特更爲出色、靜則處女動若鬚眉殊非一味强打蠻幹者可比、該隊實力、實遠在綠隊之上、東南乙不稍示弱、亦屢有上好表演、惟後衛時以遠球送前方、使前鋒不及追趕、徒然失機、前鋒聯絡不佳、陳再春自私自利、時用遠射、難有所獲、上半時二十五比九、總結果三十三比十三、美婦勝、裁判甚鬆、當罰不罰、適與前者相反、</p>

<h3>東南勝德律風</h3>
<p>東南球藝、有退無進、後衛技術、頗覺生氣、遠不如前、前鋒劃文華太呆、徐文英抖擻、廖祝之操之過急、僅任淑較出色耳、該隊新敎練某、敎而不練、練而不敎、有以致之、德律風勃拉托勇敢非凡、屢建奇功、開始後、勃拉托先中三分、後東南一鼓作氣連得十二分、第二節德律風聲勢殊盛、反以八比六佔先、第三節形勢平均、第四節東南鋒芒又露、以三十三比十七勝、</p>

<h3>各隊最近成績</h3>
<p>女子籃球開始迄今、已四星期、兩江東南甲兩隊、每戰皆捷、依舊居最優勢地位划船綠隊、前衛不能投籃、並不足畏、美婦殊爲强勁、前鋒投籃之佳、傳遞之妙、不可多見、故亦有奪標之希望、茲將至昨晚止之各隊成績錄下、</p>

<h3>中校足球决塞浦東育青苦戰成和局</h3>
<p>１－１＝上下兩半時各獲一隻延長時間後一對湯糰下星期三作二次决賽</p>
<p>昨爲中校足球决賽之期、浦東育青兩隊精兵、按時到場、雙塲啦啦隊、綜計不下三四百人、呐喊震天、情况頗不寂寞、而雙方攻守、勢均力敵、動作亦極和平純正、惜昨日冷度驟增、在塲健兒、多患撁筋毛病、表演當然影響、結果成一對一和局、延長二十分、復各無所獲、但在正軌上奮鬭之精神、殊足睥睨江大足球賽也、茲略紀戰情於後、</p>
<p>▲李慕堯立功　陳吉祥鳴笛啟戰之後、浦東英雄、卽虎虎進迫育青防地吳九臯兩拒敵鋒羅斗文長脚有羅海光神韻、隔山開砲、强硬驚人惜門矮球高、未能成事、李金集召集三軍、二次南犯、如狼似虎、聲勢十分煊赫、俄頃卽闖入對方禁地、翁可法一脚落空、李慕堯趕到發腿、直射入門、浦東聲援隊、於是興高采烈、欣喜欲狂、</p>
<p>▲符質彬報仇　浦東之陣勢以齊整見優、在任何情形之下、不易動搖、論人材、育青前鋒、頗見驃悍、惜俱以匹夫之勇、不能成事、在浦東獲得一球之後、情形愈見紊亂、休息後、育青指導張之震、叮嚀囑託、始稍有眉目、相持至五十七分鐘時、育青五鋒圍攻浦東球門久久不能下、符質彬究係老將、在十五碼處、得隙射門、乃或和局、</p>
<p>▲延長時間後　七十分鐘、如飛過去、雙方皆得一球、乃又增加二十分鐘、以定勝負、互換防地之後、育青之聲勢頗見興旺、惜失機屢屢、前十分鐘、浦東蓄力防守、育青竟徒喚奈何、後十分鐘、再調防地、雙方戰士、多數發生脚縴筋毛病、無戀心戰、○對○終場、現决定下星期三作二度决賽、</p>

<p>貢獻話</p>
<h3>可驚哉入超九萬萬元</h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>國際貿易局呈報實業部，本年上半年入超爲四萬七千四百餘萬元，　預計今年全年約爲九萬萬元。這可驚的數目字，讀者試閉目以思，一個國家入超一年增加一年，到這最高紀錄，開通商以來入超未有之現象，平均每人身上須負担二元餘之外貨，此爲如何事可以淡漠視之乎？吾思國人縱如何麻木不仁，縱如何惜然不覺，但處此外貨充斥，國貨萎縮之時，亦應怦然心動，憬然覺悟，而急謀對策。天下斷無坐以待割，困以待斃之人，歐美各國，在今年一年中，感到日貨之傾銷，同時二十七國一致力謀抵制，或提高開稅，或限制進口，或輸入許可，或匯兌管理，即日本國自身，亦有進出口貿易統制之辦法。政府與同業站在同一之戰線，作一致之行動，其目光之遠大，手腕之靈敏，政策之酷練，防制之周密，各報迭有紀載，獨吾入超量多之國，反熟視無睹，忍心以任外貨之奪吾市場，吸吾膏體；以淪於萬刦不復之地乎？吾知凡有血氣，稍具良心，當不忍坐視，茲略述意見如左：</p>
<p>（一）全國經濟委員會，應從速籌備進出口貿易統制局，就近以最多之外貨，切實研究有無替代之品，並竭力予以限制。</p>
<p>（二）厚産國標記條例，早經頒佈，政府應從速實行，萬無一再展期，坐失國貨發展機會之理。</p>
<p>（三）上海各團體機關，在二十三年中，對於第二國貨年，應繼續今年的精神，來鼓動一下，最好在這一年中，對於國貨用全副的精神力量，來提倡，來服用。</p>
<p>（四）政府應通令全國各機關各學校，凡採辦貨品中，查有外貨者，一律不准報銷。</p>
<p>（五）政府或地方團體，應組織國貨委員會，對於進口貨品應予審定或鑑别並研究有無替代品，以資仿造。</p>
<p>（六）聽說二十三年將公定爲婦女國貨年，從今以後，一般女太太奶奶小姐們，所負的責任更重大，更有意義，深願個個人努力。</p>
<p>（七）全國大中小各級學校一致起來努力這國貨運動，作全國學界的總動員。</p>
<p>（八）二十三年的國貨宣傳，要從實際方面下手，與其多發空議論，不如拿出眞本領。</p>
<p>全國能如此做法，此九萬萬元之入超，或能逐年減少，以至於無有，是在政府之力量與國人之是否有决心耳。</p>
<p>國貨談話</p>
<h3>不用國貨不許結婚</h3>
<p>— 天然</p>
<p>顓橋農民敎育館張鳳山君，有婚嫁改進會的組織，凡地方上的人，大都加入這個會中，可是婚嫁改進的第一個條件，便是「不用國貨，不許結婚」。聽說監督很周，糾正很嚴，如果新夫婦中有一個隨便一些，買了外貨，那麽老實不客氣，請他們且慢結婚。非把新夫婦從脚到頭，從上身到下身，一鞋一襪，一絲一縷，非十足的都是國貨不可。否則儘你多情，不許你成美眷，完室家之好，這種辦法，倒是提倡國貨的好榜樣。推而廣之，做月老的，也可扳起面孔說：不用國貨，不做月老。做證婚人的，也可正襟危坐說，不用國貨，不替你們證婚。這樣一來，一對一對的新夫婦，都是用了國貨，明年生出來的一個一個的小寳寳，也是都用國貨，那麽，中國人用中國貨，試聞洋貨儘多，誰來光顧？這九萬萬元的入超，或者可以漸漸少去，以至於没有。</p>
<h3>女人與國貨</h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>無疑的，一個不歡喜用外國貨的主婦，在　管理之下的一個家庭之中，洋貨的足跡，也很難踏進的。所以做一個賢良的主婦，應當要做提倡國貨的急先鋒，如果丈夫買了洋貨回來，她非特不歡迎，而且還要申斥一番，這樣使她的丈夫，不但妻子用的東西，不敢買洋貨，就是他自己用的也不敢去買洋貨，而結果，在這一個賢良的主婦，管理的家庭之下，便使洋貨没有伸足的餘地了。</p>
<p>然而這樣的主婦，就我們所住的大上海都市之中說來，究竟有多少？老實說一句，眞所謂鳳毛麟角呢！大多數的主婦，她們在上海，不但不知道負起提倡國貨的使命，而且在反對方面，她們却老是愛用洋貨。要男人到外面去買些東西，回來如果是國貨呢，就是很好的東西也要說不好；要是外國貨，不好也是好的；結果，使每個的家庭之中，都充滿了洋貨的跡象，我們雖不能專怪女人，但女人却至少担任大一半的不是。</p>
<p>愛用洋貨的女人，她們這種不良的惡習，並不是一朝一夕所養成，是從小在環境方面，受了種種的薰染而養成。年輕的姑娘，生在中上之家，她的爺娘，是愛用洋貨的先遣隊，所以在年幼之期，耳濡目染，早已有洋貨比國貨好的觀念；進了學校，一般的女同學，又彼此皆然，同病相憐，誰都是崇拜洋貨的；到了青春期，結交的男朋友，唯一的重要條件，是要穿西裝的少年，誰的愛人不穿西裝，而穿中裝，阿木林，眞是丢臉呢！一朝做了主婦，愛用洋貨的心理，早已根深蒂固，那裏再改得掉呢？</p>
<p>在這樣的情况之下，一般的男子，在青年期，爲迎合女性結交朋友的主要條件起見，脫去中裝，套上西裝，是第一件要事，一旦有了愛人，吃的西菜，送人的外國貨，舶來品，戀愛成熟，結日</p>
<p>婚之後，妻子是崇拜洋貨的，吃的用的，自然也儘量的採用洋貨，以增進夫婦間的情感。洋貨在這種情况之下，使無量數的侵入人中國的一般家庭之中，使中國人每年要把好多的金錢，進貢到外國！</p>
<p>洋貨的得以充斥中國市場，中國的民衆，男女都應負其咎責，但女人，我們覺得更是重要的因素。倘然做了一個主婦能夠儘量的提倡國貨，排斥洋貨，那没洋貨在中國的勢力，便不難立刻消滅。所以做一個賢良的主婦，應做提倡國貨的先鋒，倘使全中國的主婦，都能負起提倡國貨的使命，那結果一定可把洋貨打倒，使之絕跡於中國的市場的上面呢！</p>
<p>貢献意見</p>
<h3>國貨事業職員應有之服務精神</h3>
<p>— 全甲</p>
<p>我以爲要謀國貨事業的發展，對於職員的服務道德，最須注意的。再進一層講：這就是最有效的廣告。我們國貨事業應熱烈的利用牠。孝宗武在「日本生活」裏說得很好。</p>
<p>「……日本商店你無論如何費他工夫（就是指商人），無論怎樣地選擇貨物，如果你揀不到你所要的東西，你儘可不買。你離開他的店舖時，他還是要跪着對你很恭敬地行禮，並且說：「謝謝你，千萬請你下次再來光顧！」决不會使你感到些少的不快」。</p>
<p>他山之石，可以攻錯。我們中國的店舖却不然了。假使亦不買東西而費他許多時候，客氣的對你白眼不客氣的，便給你一副晚爺面孔會駡你起來，這就是中國商業失敗的致因了。其實，你應該問問自已，爲什麽人家不喜歡你的貨？一方面，你可以對於貨品和價格比較起來，値不値人家買？西方有句諺語！「買主的眼光最公平。」你常常想這話，你的事業便不致失敗了。我們國貨事業的職員們！我們應當以嚴重的態度來改去我們和日的惡習，這就是最經濟的廣告術！</p>
<p>我們不應誇說貨品的好，這不過是暴露中國人說謊的本領。拒絕顧客第二次的光臨。我們以誠懇的對顧客說明國貨急待大衆扶助的話，雖然他不買一些東西，我們也必須和和氣氣的。</p>
<p>中華職業敎育社徴得職業界對於學徒所要的條件：是誠實，負債，忠信，服從，勤奮，耐勞，康健。</p>
<p>努力啊！這是我們事業的信條。</p>

<p>國貨討論</p>
<h3>成本會計制度與國貨事業</h3>
<p>— 周成勛</p>
<p>眼前一般國貨事業的當局，除掉常常在想擴充營業改良出品以外，還有一件事，可以說也在焦謀急慮忙於操算中的，就是出品的成本問題，的確，我們如果找到一位國貨工廠的經理或是主任，詢問他某種貨品需料多少？人工若干？總成本幾何？可以武斷說是没有具體答解的，期期核算，年年結賬，祇知道盈餘了多少或是虧短了多少，究屬盈和虧的根本原因在那裏？某種出品可以獲利？某種出品竟是賠本？都無從顯示，因此，成本會計制度在現在是很値得事業的經營　急切採用和實施的，尤其在萌芽時期的國貨業。</p>
<p>一般人的觀念，誤認成本的範圍，是僅僅包括製造上一切原料人工費用而言，實則並不是這樣狹義，每一件貨品的售出，其成本除上述一部份外，其他人事管理方面，銷售推廣方面的開支，都應當加到出品上面去，然後得到完全的成本，進言之，一家工廠求得全部出品的成本，不能認作滿足，因爲這是籠統的，不明晰的，我們必得求出每種出品的單位成本，關於這幾點，尤非仰賴成本會計不可。</p>
<p>國貨事業在今日，不是呈露着一股蓬勃的朝氣麽？但如果專從宣傳推銷上幹，不顧及成本的話，這種步驟是不合理的，反正，一個工廠能夠眞確明白各種産品的單位成本，對於營業方針上的制定售價和確立利潤，才有可靠的凖備，並且，在近來同業競爭的惡劣情形下，要立定自己脚跟抵抗外來的爭鬥，成本會計眞是强有力的臂助。</p>
<p>檢查許多規模大一些的國貨工廠，實施成本會計制度的，實不多見，實在說起來，要確立成本會計制度，先該有健全的會計組織，不少國貨工廠的當局，歡喜保守着舊式的會計，而不肯善自改革和運用，這是絕對謬誤的，現在我敢把成本會計對於事業的功效，舉數點如下：</p>
<p>（一）因爲在成本會計制度下，一切原料半成品已成品，都詳細記載得完密準確，用賬面盤存法，能每日表示收儲領用盤存的數量，由此可以杜防虛耗浪用和走漏短缺的弊端。</p>
<p>（二）各種出品，都有各别的成本計算，以分清各種出品的盈虧，可供經營者定製造上取捨的方針。</p>
<p>（三）從上項結果，可制定每種出品適宜而有利的售價。</p>
<p>（四）歷屆成本計算，能彙集分析比較，以報告於投資者，更因歷年利益的來源有顯明的表示，可作未來經營的參考，</p>
<p>（五）在成本會計制度下，縱使人事頻繁，管理複雜，然因各部辦事層次分明，各有責任的聯鎖性，間接形成内部牽制組織。</p>
<p>（六）同業各廠都有眞實的成本計算，可以相互對照，以資比較，而定撙節開支减輕成本的途徑。</p>
<p>根據以上幾點·斷定成本會計制度所給予事業的效益很大，經營國貨事業的當局，首先該認清成本會計是事業進行最好的輔佐，絕對不能珍惜籌備實施時的精神財力，同時，舊式的會計，是大部份缺乏原理的蓄養，應該廢除而先實行新式的會計來，然後談得到成本會計制度。</p>
<p>本文主旨，是在闡明成本會計制度與國貨事業關係的密切，至於如何設計，如何實施，非本文範圍以内，我想留着再討論罷！</p>
<h3>國貨談屑</h3>
<p>— 麒年</p>
<p>要養成嗣後的國民都服用國貨，須要做母親的多負些責任，使幼童的腦子裏，就得了嗜愛國貨的觀念。</p>
<p>不受外國貨的引誘，最好避免住洋房，因爲洋房裏的裝飾，總缺不了洋貨。</p>
<p>設筵席的主人家，應以用魚翅等仇貨爲可恥；其實，用了那些，不見得表示你的闊綽，適足以表示你的人格。</p>
<p>「一絲一粟，當思來處不易」。應改爲「一絲一物，須查問來處是否國貨」。</p>
<p>夥計嘴裏的話，有時是靠不住的，所以要買國貨，最好還是到誠實可靠的國貨處所去。</p>
<p>你不能完全盲從，也應該鑑别一下，當你别人勸你買東西而你有些懷疑是外貨的時候。</p>
<p>不論你在何處能握住權威的話，（如家庭裏社會上）你應該做一個提倡國貨的模範者，如是比低層階級下民衆喊提倡國貨的收效當然來得迅速；不過你千萬要言行一致，免得失了他們的信仰。</p>
<p>用外國字做商標的，大都是化裝品和捲烟，他們說利用顧客的心理，然而適足以自殺他們自已的銷路。</p>
<p>國貨年的歲暮，我們憧憬的，還不過幾次國貨遊行和國貨宣傳的印象而已。我想提倡由國貨公司和商店組成一條「國貨街」，那末不但顧主採購便利，産品也　競進。</p>
<p>國貨漫談</p>
<h3>冬令怎樣保護皮膚</h3>
<p>— 何麗英女士</p>
<p>▲國貨中之夜用雪花膏</p>
<p>冬天到了，一般青年男女，爲了要保護他們嬌嫩的容顔起見，於是雪花膏一類的化妝品，便成了他們唯一的恩物付麽，「雪」呀！「霜」呀，那種出品多得五花八門，目爲之炫，大衆們都各自選擇，他們所愛用的物品購買。</p>
<p>不過，雪花膏一類的品物，製造精良者，確能在皮膚表面形成一層薄膜，而防免風日的侵襲，同時，也可使皮膚白晳細膩。維持他的青春美；在敷粉塗脂以前，先用雪花膏打底子，尤爲必要。但是倘然用了那不良的製品，就有閉塞毛孔的弊害！所以購用雪花膏時，必須加以精細的選擇。</p>
<p>雪花膏的種類，大别可分爲二：一種是日間用的，即無脂性的雪花膏（西文名ＤayＣream）現在市上普通所售的的，皆是此類雪花膏。一種是晚間臨睡前用的，即脂肪性的雪花膏，（西文名ＮightＣream）此品在歐美各國早已成爲日用化妝要品，尤其是在冬令，人體的皮膚，因爲受着天氣的寒冷，而自然的起了緊縮，感着脂肪的不足，發現了枯燥現象，因此必須賴人工的脂肪雪花膏，使之潤澤，並促進皮膚本體上的新陳代謝作用。</p>
<p>現在此種夜用雪花膏，在國貨中也已有了精美的出品了；據我所知道知的，中國化學工業社所出的「芳澤脂」，便是很美的脂腯性雪花膏。</p>
<p>芳澤脂的顔色，是潔白得異常可愛，香味是有一種幽致的杏仁氣，臨睡時把他在手臂頭頸各部，其中所含的油脂質，可以探入毛孔，將日間所受的塵垢脂粉，吸除凈盡，直接使皮膚潔白光潤，防制皮膚上的糙裂凍諸患；當此冬令時節，確是愛美的仕女底恩物。</p>
<p>末了，我還有一點須告訴讀者，就是該品的價格，要比同類的外貨便宜一半，所以在經濟上，也很是節省呢。</p>
<h3>農村裏的國貨巡禮</h3>
<p>— 玄萬</p>
<p>這一次，我因了病，請假回里，在這龐大的怪物廟，脫離了紙醉金迷的都市，帶到我早經破物的農村裏丨丨浙西的一個小鎭，一年多不回去的我，看來自然一切都變了，從前很熱鬧的市集，現在却冷清清的怕人，絲米的相繼失敗的自然尤爲他們的致命傷，看胼手胝足，農人，在幾重深痛的創痕後，蒼老的面上，滿推着深刻的愁紋，慘淡得毫無生氣，「農村破産了，」這呼聲是已由麻木的耳聞，而親眼目睹了，　我在這感到深深的痛苦後，却因了自然的激使，滿抱着一團高興，　去行了個農村的國貨巡禮。</p>
<p>果然，農村裏的大批物件，還是純粹的土貨，但是，你只要一檢視他市集裏的幾爿洋廣雜貨號，就得使你咋大驚奇，惟滿着店櫃，市窗内的十分之七八，却都是十足道地的洋貨，而這洋貨裏，却大半又都是仇貨，他們完全是使展着傾銷的手段，導最低廉的價格，來勾引我們這些購買力薄弱已達極點的無知鄕民，居心的惡劣，措置的卑鄙，這都是不勝髮指的，至於眞眞的農村裏，田岸上，稻塲上，却只有幾個呌喊的販子，清響的喉嚨，挑着一副笨重的擔子，什麽面盆啊！套鞋啊！毛巾和襪子啊！……一切的農村家庭日用品，在這裏，到可常常見到我們國貨的踪跡，不過，都是次貨，再次貨，這大槪是因爲價格的關係吧！</p>
<p>雖然，救濟農村，抵制仇貨，這都是我們整個的問題，非一時所可解决，但我們目睹到這種怪現象，到底覺得太不滿意了，他所給我們的感想，是因爲農民購買力薄弱，而遭受仇貨的　乘機活躍，奸商的藉此猖狂，所以現在我們正應以直接的廣告或有力的宣傳，最好是能求成本减輕，以低售價，先去感化鄕民，然後漸謀澈底抵制之法，至於我這次農村國貨的檢討，雖不能代表全國農村，但至少到底也正是給我們一個很好的敎訓·而引起我們以後的注意。</p>
<p>參觀筆記</p>
<h3>參觀女青年會國展記</h3>
<p>— 張孟昭</p>
<p>「國貨年」三字，即將跟着一九三三年的時代巨輪，很迅速的轉動過去了！我們檢視旣往，瞻念未來，就不期然而然，要覺得愴傷！覺得痛心！愴傷的是志士大聲疾呼的，喊着提倡國貨，警覺同胞，但是：能有幾多人革面洗心樂用土貨呢？事實告訴我們，簡直回首愴傷吧了！</p>
<p>痛心的是：洋貨跟着國貨運動而愈加猖獗！不是嗎？脂香粉進口的統計數字，報紙告訴我們駭人聽聞嗎？當這新舊歲月將要交替的時候，有兩個國貨展覽，作最後的掙扎！努力！一是中華國産廠商聯合會所主辦之上海市特區國貨運動大會，一是上海女青年會所主辦之婦女國貨展覽會，在這歲間年尾，放萬丈之光芒！我以爲後者，尤較前者爲最迫切，爲最需要，因爲在中國婦女的立塲，握着國貨盛衰樞紐的全權，丈夫，子，女，的飲食，衣着，和家用器物，在在繫於家主婆身上，所以該會國貨展覽，開幕那天，我急要和韵清驅車往觀，藉資借鏡，雖然這個很有意義的國展盛會，是開在十里洋場帝國主義的租界上，是開在高大洋房，歐化建築之中，但是牠給與我們國人的印象，是很深！很遠大的！我倆參觀之後，十分滿意！滿意的地方，就是陳列國貨，不尙呆板，而尙立體式的，活動式的，這裏最有價値的，要推中國國貨公司布置的「模範家庭」了！陳設的國貨，若鋼床，若鏡臺，若衣櫉，抽斗，籐椅，紅木傢具，也居然光亮整潔，照耀眼簾，計分五百元，一千元，二千元三等，眞是呌人模倣的一個好程式，二千元的家庭，似乎太覺得貴族化些，有能力的當然可以照辦，普通的還是照五百元式的好！那天參觀模範家庭的男女青年，我倆看上去，人人很有深刻的興味，回去也一定有很深刻的印象，而大家去樂用國貨了！我意今後不開國貨展覽則已！要開的話，應該取立體式的，活動式的才對，換言之，就是要實地試騐起來，譬如三友社的自由布，要表明不褪色，就該拿他掛在水中央，給大家看，國布繖撑在噴水下點滴，表明牠的緊密實用，這是最最重要的一點。</p>
<p>其次我倆參觀後的良好印象，是小學生演說競賽中「學生葑於提倡國貨所負之責任」小小心靈中，均有國貨的認識，清心學校，女生金嬌美，年齡很稚，竟能在臺上演手作勢，激昻慷慨地演說，如何要用國貨，如何打倒洋貨，挽救國家，口齒伶俐，雖成年人亦愧不如，這樣愛用國貨的思想，深印在小主人翁的腦海中，定可以挽回旣失利權，國貨才永遠有出路，不知摩登化的奶奶太太們，聽了她的演講，面部赤化後，作何感想？</p>

<h3>明兒與國貨</h3>
<p>— 烟影</p>
<p>明兒今年十三歲，在小學讀書，他聽了他老師和父母的話，非常知道愛國，非常愛用國貨，我們可以看看他所寫的信：</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>志成事兄：</p>
<p>昨天接到你的信，我很快活。你還送我二樣度玩具，我眞感謝啊！</p>
<p>但是這二樣玩具雖然很好，我也很愛玩，不過我看好像不是我國國貨。聽得别人說，近來街上買這東西的很多，都是仇貨，不知你的是那裏買的？</p>
<p>現在我們國貨也有這種玩具，做得比仇貨更有趣，堅牢，我父親曾經買給我玩的。我想我們是中國國民，應當用中國國貨，所以你送來的我不要。</p>
<p>你送來的東西我還你，另外送你二樣國貨的玩具。你也聽見我師講過，我們千萬不要去買外國貨，請你以後多買國貨，幷不要怪我！</p>
<p>就要開學了，多麽快樂啊！再會！祝你</p>
<p>康健！　弟明兒</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>大姊：</p>
<p>我們分别以來，已經好幾個月了。我們都很掛念你，你身體好嗎？</p>
<p>昨天二表哥到我們家裏來，他買了許多衣料，說是你託他買的。我看這種衣料都是外國貨，價錢很貴，要幾元錢一尺。唉！我傷心極了！</p>
<p>爸爸時常說：「中國的貧弱，都因爲人民不愛國的緣故。大家歡喜買外國貨，把金錢送給外國人，我們的工業因此就不發遲了。」爸爸的話你不是也聽見的嗎？你也很贊成的，你從前也呌我要愛國，爲什麽你現在買那外國貨呢？</p>
<p>别的東西不說，絲綢本來是我國的出産的，近來更加改良，聽說並不比外國貨劣，價錢却大爲便宜，那末我們自然應當去買國貨綢緞來做衣服的，你說錯不錯啊？</p>
<p>我寫這封信，就是要勸你以後無論什麽東西多要買國貨。再會！祝你</p>
<p>愛國！　明弟</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>二表哥哥：</p>
<p>前天你到我們家裏，我們很快樂，可惜你就回去了。</p>
<p>你所說的買外國貨的話，我聽了很佩服。唉！我們同胞們爲什麽都歡喜買外國貨呢？眞可嘆啊！你說各機關裏用的東西，差不多是外國貨，這是眞的嗎？我不相信，難道他們不曉得愛國的嗎？我們老師說，政府裏現在竭力提倡國貨，但是你都說他們多用外國貨，這是什麽道理呢？</p>
<p>我以爲還有一種人也是買外國貨買得很多的，就是女人。你看我大姊託你買的衣料，價錢又貴，又並不是没有國貨綢緞可以做衣服。他們的粉啊，香水啊，全要買外國貨，唉！她們眞没有心肝！</p>
<p>你說只有我們小學生最愛國，却是不敢當的。我們不過大家都想做一個好國民，希望四萬萬同胞大家齊心愛國，齊心都買國貨，那才好了！祝你</p>
<p>康健！　表弟明兒</p>

<h3>新婚之夜</h3>
<p>— 寒玉</p>
<p>時間已是四點鐘了，鬧新房的游客，都已散去，可是房中的一切，都有生氣勃勃的景象，新郎和新娘，經過了興奮的喧擾以後，一此俊意也没有，於是新郎突然的問道：</p>
<p>「靜宜：我有一個問題問你」，新娘斗的一驚，斜視着新郎，新郎就繼續問道：「你這一次買的東西，那一國的貨物最多」？</p>
<p>新娘的心，頓時就寛下來，停了一停，就回答道：「這可以請你放心的，我這次買的東西，都是國貨」。</p>
<p>「是誰的主意呢」？</p>
<p>新娘再慢慢地答道：「我在九一八之後，就加入國貨十人團的，……」</p>
<p>「你也加入國貨十人團麽」？新郎怱遽地問，「那麽我們眞是同志了」。</p>
<p>新娘繼續說下去：「我加入的目的，是看到我們國民救國最好的方法，就是服用國貨。只有用經濟的抵制，才能使國家眞的繁榮起來，並且，都市的女子，應當做全國女子的表率，但是現在却都去用外國貨了。這可以做全國的表率麽？所以我就　　决　的　用國貨了。服用的結果，知道國貨的質料，並不比外國貨壞，那麽爲什麽要去用外國貨呢？這眞是我們都市女子的羞恥」。</p>
<p>新郎在桌子上隨意拿起幾樣東西來看，上面都印着國貨的商標，他快竊極了，就向新娘說道：「你眞是我理想的妻子，我們就在今天再下一個誓，我們永遠不用外貨」。</p>
<p>「我們永遠不用外貨」。</p>

<h3>詩國改選</h3>
<p>— 煙橋</p>
<p>詩人金鶴望先生，在前數年，曾有詩國選舉的游戲之作。當時尙是總統　，所以他選的人物，是</p>
<p>大總統　顧炎武　副總統　屈大均</p>
<p>内閣總理　曾國藩　内務總長　范當世</p>
<p>外交總長　黄遵憲　財政總長　樊增祥</p>
<p>敎育總長　王士禎　司法總長　沈德潛</p>
<p>交通總長　袁　枚　實業總長　程晋芳</p>
<p>陸軍總長　趙文哲　海軍總長　邱滄海</p>
<p>上面所舉的幾位詩人，除掉顧，屈，曾，黄，樊，王，沈，袁，大家都知道他們的生平以外。像范當世字肯堂，是通州人，其詩合蘇黄之長，有范伯子集。程晋芳字魚門，號蕺園，是歙縣人，有蕺園詩。趙文哲宇損之，號璞函，上海人，有　雅堂集。乾隆時從尙書温福討金川，師敗身殉，是一位戎馬書生。邱滄海臺灣人，十餘年前卒。選舉的標準，非但取其詩，還要體騐他的學術行誼，袁子才游踪廣及，確宜交通，沈歸愚道貌岸然，深合司法，可算得名實相副，不至有忝厥職了。</p>
<p>歷年旣久，人才自然也要代謝。因之鶴望先生在國學會出版的國學論衡第二期上，豋着布告，請會友改選。將於第三期發表，那些抱殘守缺，憔悴以終之士，在九原之下，可以吐一口氣了。並且這種選舉，非常公平，生存者無被選舉權的，詩鬼不至運動了，就是眞有一縷吟魂，來繞筆端，選舉者儘管直道孤行，不阿所好啊。</p>
<p>這玩意兒，以前文人老早有過，像呂居仁的江西宗派圖，就是始作俑者。清之中葉，舒位有乾嘉詩壇點將錄，把詩人比擬水泊英雄，雖是擬不於倫，却也倔强可喜。可惜名位太多，未免有泛濫之病。依我說，須適合今體，於主席以下，置院分部，那麽源流派别，更有跡象可尋了。</p>
<h3>廿餘年前之愛多亞路</h3>
<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>上海的情形，眞是五年一小變，十年一大變。任您是老上海，祗要離開了幾年不到，便有些恍惚糢糊，認不得那條是南京路，那條是福州路，只見崇樓華厦，霓虹萬家，一片繁華，動蕩心目罷哩。曾聽先大父錦庭公談過，他老人家到上海時，南京路以北完全是荒墟義塜，那福建路尙是一條河道，野艇自橫，充滿着鄕村景色。今天一變而爲人烟稠密，車轂不絕的熱鬧市區，固非當時夢想所及呢。</p>
<p>我生也晚，當然瞧不見最初的上海。但是我尙記得二十餘年前的愛多亞路的情狀，這時先大父猶健在，蘇滬兩處，都有業産，我住在上海，讀書沿城脚的敦仁學校。每天到校，必要經過愛多亞路，那時愛多亞路是一條洋涇浜，爲英法租界天然的分界。浜上架橋往來，所以至今還有帶鈎橋，鄭家木橋，東新橋的名目。浜北是英租界，駁岸修築，較爲完整。那浜南的法租界，　却圮廢不堪，荒蕪滿目，堤岸泥罅中，　滋生螃蜞。我每天放學歸家，常和幾個頑皮的同學，爬到傾斜的廢堤上去捕捉螃蜞，螃蜞雖小，雙螯却很厲害，一不留心，便有血指之虞。可是頑劣性成，痛楚在所不顧，捉得了多隻，置諸最大的香烟匣子裏，居然滿裝而歸。另外用個洋鐵餅乾箱，把和水的黏土累積其中，挖成孔穴，俾螃蜞可以出入棲止，幷給些食物，這樣一來，螃蜞的生命，得以延長若干時日，兒時情形，一輕回憶，宛和昨日的事。如今愛多亞路成爲全上海最闊的通衢，兩旁夷宇高矗，市廛櫛比，一到寫字間上下時間，那摩托卡風馳電掣，接連不斷。舊時的痕跡，　渺不可尋，若然說到那裏去捉螃蜞，豈不成爲笑話了嗎。</p>
<h3>弔秋將軍</h3>
<p>— 清癯</p>
<p>蟋蟀，小小的秋蟲，而歡喜把他來决鬥，爭一個勝負，雖擲千金，倒也不惜：那末，這一輩人們，看蟋蟀的貴重，自然比人類中「出類拔萃」的英豪健將差不多了。前晚時本埠破獲鬥蟋蟀的册場，大半的名人物，而被逮到捕房裏去的，竟有七十餘人：除了當時交數百元保出外，其它還覊押在裏頭：後來解至特區地方法院，各處罰金有差；那養蟋蟀的，雖罰了金，不算甚麽一回事；但是許多「將軍」（彼中人，呼蟋蟀皆以此兩字尊之。）被他一時蹂躪，弄得盆碎缸破，頭足不全，猝斃在場中的，不曉得多少；這實在是最可惜，也最可恨的。前有一位朋友寄來「一個訃文，」余看了，眞不覺失笑，這「赴文」原來是爲蟋蟀開喪，所以「赴文」上面，說着：</p>
<p>哀啓者，白青秋將軍，痛於民國二十二年，十一月廿二日未時，壽終敝寢，距得於夏曆中秋前三日申刻，享壽五十日，茲擇於十二月二十日，掘土埋葬於家園之西偏，幷加書識，題曰「白青秋將軍之墓，」辱在有秋興之誼者，謹此赴聞！</p>
<p>這位朋友，可算滑稽之極了，他幷且附有一封個人的信，說明：「這一只將軍，當時化了三百四十元大洋，由杭州買來，曾經交綏過三次，可稱無敵的常勝將軍：不料這回遽遭不幸，雖不是戰之罪，得以出險歸來，然而近幾天，寒暖不常，調護失度，昨日晨起一看，已經殭斃了。嗚呼哀哉；」我看信上的話，不由得笑了　也要掉幾句哀惋的文字，和朋友盡個應酬的俗套，就提起筆來，擒詞以弔之，幷以寄答朋友：詞曰：　嗟爾小小之秋蟲，而不自寧息兮，瞿　瞿之鳴聲以聒好弄之頑童。卒使斷垣　破壁之間，而毁室家兮，不能伏處以　游優而入牢籠。雅人得之名爲秋興兮　，而咸自命爲賈似道之流風。詎料白　牙與青錦兮，（即將軍之特異處，）遑　論簑衣金帶月額玲瓏。（其他將軍之　優點，）敗則一蹶不振而退避怱怱兮　，勝若樹赤幟而頃刻爲紅。然而交綏　之際末由自主兮，悉係人之挑撥與撮　弄。悲哉偌大之黄金恣爾一喙兮，物　固徒盡愚忠而人亦囊爲之空。何况類　似賭博捉將官裏去兮，法所不容，而　且以罰鍰是從。是則無異今之軍閥甘　爲戎首兮，雖據地而稱雄，終之貽笑　狗功，而犧牲自供。亦復何苦肆盡威　風以妄干非分兮，吾弔將軍振翼張牙　而罹厥凶，不得不陳詞以喚醒夢夢。</p>
<h3>談年報</h3>
<p>— 新</p>
<p>每逢陽曆或陰曆的新年，因各大報停刊，於是一般打秋風的人，想撈一筆外快，發行年報。在三年前，各大報停刊多至九日，確是一筆大進欵，所以年報多至二十餘種，他們的銷數，自數百份至數千份，但是銷數愈少，進欵愈多，憑各人的努力，拉攏廣告的多少，就是人他的入息。現在各大報爲競爭起見，自元旦日起，停刊三天，但是這三天内，另發行號外，接受一切廣告，並預先通知各影戲院商店，如是，一般打秋風的年報，好像晴天霹靂，受了死刑一樣，故臨時取銷者，不在少數，這可算是他們最失意的事情了。</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第二十回　卜吉有期老人連日笑剷愁不盡舊雨對門居</p>
<p>桂枝回頭看時，乃是甘家新來的女僕劉媽，他對於桂枝和甘家過去的一段交涉，是不知道的，便答道：這幾天在家裏躺着呢，今天才剛剛好一點。劉媽道：可不是嗎？現在又鬧時令症，我們家老爺病重得很，城裏的親戚，全來瞧他的病來了。桂枝道：什麽病呢，這樣重法？你們家二爺也來了嗎！劉媽道：來了好幾天了。病人一多半的事，都是他伺候着呢。他還向我打聽來着……說到這裏向桂枝看了一眼，微微的笑着。桂枝祇當不介意，很隨便的問道：他打聽什麽？劉媽笑道：他問你什麽時候出閣呢。他說和你們連長很有交情，預備出個重重的分子。桂枝紅着臉笑道：我看這話，是你瞎謅的。他打聽我的下落作什麽？劉媽道：我實在是眞話，改天你遇着他，你就明白了。桂枝聽了他這話，增加了無限的感觸，手上拿着那個小包袱，竟是站着楞住了。劉媽也不便和他多說話，掉轉身來走了。桂枝站定了一會，抬頭看時，劉媽已經走開了，心想儘在這裏站着，也未免無聊，於是拿了包袱，自向王裁縫家去，約一小時之後，他又走回到原處來了。他到了甘家門口，伸着頭向人家院子裏一看，可另外有什麽動靜？當他這樣看的時候，恰是甘積之在院子裏由東至西，他並不曾料到大門外有人在探望他，所以眼光朝前，没有看到桂枝。倒是桂枝心裏跳了雨下，情不自禁的，人跟着向後一縮。及至積之已經走了過去了，他又裝着失落了什麽東西似的，祗管在胡同裏徘徊却不住的偷着向門裏面看了去，徘徊了許久，積之終於是不能再出來，他就祗好低着頭，慢慢的走回家去。（二七三）</p>

<h3>上海花店</h3>
<p>— 陳碧君</p>
<p>花能養性，花可怡情，吾人經過花店，每每喜歡佇足凝睥，賞鑒一下，花的魔力的確不小，近年以來，盛行栽培新法，提倡養花，花店開設，日見增多，是亦新興事業的一種。</p>
<p>上海的花店，大槪以四川路，斜橋總會，霞飛路一帶居多，光亮的玻璃窗底下，陳列着玲瓏剔透的花籃，和四圍環繞的紅紅綠綠五色繽紛的花朶花葉，偶然踏進去好像置身香國，偎翠依紅一樣。據說花店窗内的布置，當推西區爲佳，考究的人家，在玻窗上還綴着霓虹電炬，一到夜市，光彩通明，籠罩着嬌艶花枝上頭，更顯示精神奕奕。花籃製造的技能，那末無過於四川路老旗昌一帶了。它的出品顔色平匀，疏密有致，具有美術思想，上次蒔花會裡的花籃競賽，就是該處某店獲譬首選。</p>
<p>西門南陽橋地方，有花的市場，在黎明的時候，各種的花，都麕集一處，色色形形，應有盡有，花店主人，都到那裡採購，有的花店老闆，在近郊地方，闢地種花，拿自己出産來販賣也有的。總之市場裏的花，滿坑滿谷，任人支配，任人捆紮，是不値得愛護的。一到了花店裏，就珍惜超來，好像鄕下姑娘進了城，淡掃蛾眉，身披羅綺，馬上身價十倍似的。上等的花，以朶以束計算，出賣花籃花圈的價値，起碼每隻兩元，多則十數元，數十元不等，國人每多歡喜雜色，西人專愛單純。</p>
<p>國人開設的花店，大槪出售零碎鮮花，精製花籃花圈爲大宗，間有代人家布置禮堂，包紮彩牌的。東洋人的花店，還附帶着盆景假山和金魚雀鳥一類東西出售，他們的店名，似乎比較文雅，不像我們的專門取些發財順利等字樣，看遍了一百多家國人經營的花店，大槪要算斜橋的露春和古拔路的豢蝶花店招牌，爲庸中佼佼了。</p>
<p>習俗的改良，不能不算都市的進化，從前的陋習的現在漸漸地淘汰了，弔奠送贈花圈，，結婚·做壽·送行·捧角都是些花籃，就是探望病人，也送鮮花一束，使他苦的環境中，得着些甜的慰藉。記起當年國聯滿案調查團，經過東京，美女送花，這大槪除了敬意以外，還帶着點兒媚意呢。</p>
<p>花的時節，暮春和夏天最爲繁盛，代價也最便宜。但康耐馨則四季都有，它的顔色分大紅·粉紅·淺白三種，西洋人最愛它，貴的時候的就是化一元去買十二朶，也不吝惜的。現在菊花已凋零，花店裏依然靠它去掙扎，其餘黄的，白的，紅的月季花，和些象牙紅，一年四季長綠的山草，繽紛的排列着，最時髦的要算水仙和白的茨菇花了，菖蘭和大麗花本是繁植的，大麗花現在匿跡了，菖蘭盛開於春夏兩季，近來我國常常利用延遲它的種植時期，加以伸縮，得能長時間的出售，它是球根，形同地栗，，花的顔色很多，最普遍的爲淡黄色，外裏輕薄膜衣，對於冬季嚴寒，有相當的抵抗力量，一年四季，洋花居多，本國的花，只有三成罷了。</p>
<p>我的書案，我的臥室，都愛揷着些鮮花，當那漫漫的長夜，寂寞的氛圍裏，在幽靜燈光底下，或明月斜照當中，對着花色，領着花香，漂泊的人生，會得着無限的安慰。可惜經過些時，花瓣謝了，花葉枯丁，它被人冷淡了，終於被人委棄。唉！昔日的綺麗，空留着些心頭的悵惘，然而少年人所顚倒的幻夢，都隨着韶光消逝，所賤下的，也不過是些不易銷磨的創痕罷了。</p>

<p>人標前市開盤、以美棉微漲、人氣略好、各月漲一·二·角、午後聞現紗走銷甚滯、市况平平、各月漲一·二角、全日成交統計五千包、查賣出賡豐四百五十包、通記五百包、錦昌四百包、信誠四百包、買進大豐三百五十包、明德五百包、長豐四百五十包、同和三百包、德記二百五十包、收盤價如下、</p>

<h3>本月花有軋空模樣</h3>
<p>棉市本月份趨漲、因溥益廠有收貨軋空說、故在此紗市下跌之際、棉花反見上漲、查本月份之價、較現棉價稍高、完全散空抵補所致也、本月份買方準備收二萬擔、檢騐處已有一萬多擔、就大勢測之、恐無大漲力、國府美棉在市兜售、願照市打七折、然廠方紗無出路、無意接受、</p>
<h3>鄭標好二角</h3>
<p>鄭標前市開盤、場中賣戶不多、各月漲一角半、午後又漲五分至一角、全日成交統計四萬四千三百擔、查賣出穗隆三千担、新亨一千二百担、源大四千担、瑞大一千担、森康一千担、恒昌一千三百担、信誠一千一百擔、買進吉豐二千一百担、昌記一千三百擔、錦昌一千三百担、遠大二千四百擔、長豐三千八百担、同興二千二百担、源興昌一千三百担　收盤價如下、</p>

<h3>紗花交割日期已提早</h3>
<p>丨來年開市當在四日丨</p>
<p>本市紗布交易所、十二月份紗花交割、本訂十二月三十日、現因年暮關係、改爲二十九日舉行交割、棉花本月份交易做至二十六日止、棉紗營業做至二十七日止、三十日結賬、三十一日星期、大槪至二十三年一月四日照常開市、</p>
<h3>美棉有補空而回漲</h3>
<p>丨丨其他棉價均見跌</p>
<p>昨日美棉市况、呆滯無特色、同業取　望態度、先因多頭了結而跌、後以空頭抵補回堅、結果現貨漲十磅音、期貨漲五磅音至十三磅音、利物浦棉現貨跌三點、期貨跌一二點、埃及棉現貨跌三點、孟買棉市、平靜無特色、結果平加爾跌二羅比半、奥姆辣跌一羅比二角半、白羅溪跌七角半、原電錄左、（十九日電）</p>

<h3>糧食粉麥徘徊帶軟象</h3>
<p>粉市上午開盤後、各月份呈初平繼穩之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥小二角零、坎拿大好一角左右、故開價後、市面平穩、後因各廠抛貨、均事觀望、市場籌碼、彷彿缺少、所以各月份市氣、計回好近分、迨至下午開盤、人心曾一度俏利、因業外浮多、及一部客帮、略有收進、近期較上午又好近分、遠期則以人心平平、兼以洋麥之空氣愈益不振、故人心虛軟、至四盤後、近期因多頭回出甚暢、市氣遂亦大鬆、至現洋麥雖未兜售、但内中仍有鬆濫之勢、故買氣又大受打擊矣、結果本月份祗好五厘、一月份反小七厘半、二月份小二厘半、三月份小七厘半、四月份小五厘、五月份小七厘半、</p>
<p>麥市、上下午開盤後、各月份市面、呈近跌遠定之象、本月份因係最後交易之日、上午初開時、尙開一角三分、後因實際籌碼、聞有七八十車、一部分無力多頭、紛紛回出、致市面步步瀉落、收盤時跌至四元零三分、較初開竟狂落一角、至下午開盤、本月份因行家預備收進、空頭又補、較上午回好三五分、遠期各月份、交易始終清淡、上落亦少、結果本月較前日跌六分、一月份小一分、二月份大一分、餘無出入、現麥市面、見交仍少、價則鬆落角許、開山東麥四元一角、五百包、由華豐辦去、</p>
<h3>陰變元高貨上漲角許</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源五十餘號、（七千餘石）、内有晚稻十廿號、而包胃去路忽見轉懈、是以形勢甚清、所幸到貨較稀、經售方極度扳緊、市况尙能站定、統計共去一千餘包、俱屬青角松泗之貨、其如西練等之中關者、因包胃悉未採取、均爲另胃所納、而本街店胃雖未較遜、然以人心難堅、市况又呈平平、餘若常帮南港等厚粳、都無甚榮辱、僅蘇同粳貨乏做俏、行情續提數分、杜洋尖略見帶緊、陰變元酒戶及零胃頗有動辦、高者已上升角許、中關者亦起數分、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路來源三十餘號、市上各貨去胃平常、市形白粳早緊午懈、各尖變陰元早薄稻等各色均呈挺立之格、</p>
<h3>客秈閩銷又活</h3>
<p>▲到頭不絕價小數分</p>
<p>昨日客秈市况、因月初銷活價漲、各地來貨相繼到申、路中未到者爲數亦多　因此人心又虛、行販亦在求脫中、晨間市形甚軟、各米一律回小三五分至近角不等、較高者尙可站定、惟福州帮本有胃口、今以市價平落、隨趁小辦裝、本街亦稍應酬、全市福州辦去糙仁米九十五包、沙市糙米四百三十二包、南京車糙一百九十七包、又柳秈一百九十七包、甬帮只辦蕪湖機元一百包、本街辦去江西機元九十一包、湖南機靖三百二十包、目下市面以到存兩足而論、暫無好面、若南省去路再旺、本街囤戶繼辦、或有轉機希望也</p>
<h3>花生暢銷生仁不動</h3>
<p>▲花生　自上市以來、其市雖有變遷、然各地銷場連綿不斷、價較生仁平穩、昨郯城貨開一千餘包、價爲四元九角至四元七角、除寗波帮採去五十包外、餘均本街辦進、</p>
<p>▲生仁　市仍不振、去路出口不動、廠家本街略有問訉、昨未開出、來源雖少、但底積約有五六萬包之譜、若往年於此時有二十餘萬包之存貨、人心尙平、惟在此不景氣之局中、有二三萬包存積、故人心見惶也、</p>
<h3>南北貨　新大粒圓已有開出</h3>
<p>大粒新桂圓、二三批所到之貨、因成本高昂、不合銷胃、久擯未開、茲　貨漸稀、而新貨亦無續到、故行方進意略見活動、昨聞號方已有成交一二百箱、價比最高時小去七八元不一、雖屬虧本、然去路仍少、後市恐難回好云、</p>
<p>生意經（五十）</p>
<h3>形形色色之洋鎖</h3>
<p>鎖是不論門　器具、都有需要的，加以機械進步，我國康有的鎖，竟有以他搆造簡單，尤其是都市中幾乎絕跡，而自英美日德運來的鎖，不論好壞，居然得着根大的銷路，卽俗稱洋鎖的便是。</p>
<p>鎖的買賣，是照「羅」計算，（按一羅爲十打），市上盛行的鎖，（一）方鎖，普通用的多是，八○八和七一○兩種，每一種中尙有大小，（二）插鎖，鎖球部分有金屬和搪瓷銀屬的配合。（三）彈弓門鎖，俗稱彈簧鎖，有許多的分别，號碼有三五一七，二三○○，二一○○，二四○○，二五○○，四二○四，四二○七，一五○四，六○六六，一一一，七一四○等。（四）圓鎖，有十六，十八，十九，二十一等種。（五）月形鎖，形狀像月，分有六種，十五，二十五，三十五，四十五，五十五，六十五等，用公匣來區别。（六）白包鎖，因鎖身包有白亮金屬，其大小在鎖身上有公厘號碼，十五，二十五，三五，四五，五五，六五，等數種。（七）黑色鎖和白銅包鎖，不過在鎖身上所包黑色和白銅，春他和白包鎖一樣的。（八）鍍銀鎖，鍍有銀質故名，大小有二十五，三十五，四五，五五等。（九）黄銅銷，用黄銅製成，大小有二十五，三十五，四十五，五十五，四種。（十）三角鎖，爲三角形，雙開鎖，兩面可開，色鎖，鎖身中間有各種顔色，白鉛鎖，色如白鉛灰白狀等，其他槓杆式圓筒式羅盤式，有以附加靈機和時針都是隨需要者的選用罷了。</p>
<h3>糖市　新潮青再跌四角</h3>
<p>昨糖市趨勢尙屬平定、交易較爲活動、公會劃盤二四粗砂白普通貨劃十九元七角半、小去二分、成交六百餘包、轉口貲呌六元九角、原價未成、二十號中砂白普通劃十九元三角半、八九號荷赤ＳＲ嘜劃十五元八角、轉口高貨呌七元零五分、太古糖Ｂ嘜二十元二角半不動、ＣＷ嘜小二分、廿元零零八分、新潮青號盤又小四角、開出三百餘包、提莊青十四元、以次爲十三元八角至五角、振記綿白一號呌十八元九角、未有成交</p>
<h3>絲茶　絲市内外均無銷路</h3>
<p>▲浙絲業積繭難銷</p>
<p>浙屬杭紹湖嘉繅絲廠雖有二十餘家、而秋間免强開工者、祗及十之四、現下趕繅餘繭預備停工者、不過二三家、然各廠商手中存積未繅之春秋二季乾繭、共達一萬五千担、堪供繅製廠絲二千七八百担、其中以模範絲廠等存繭最多、川鄂粗絲、印銷不暢、滬存充厚、來源寥落、前日始自江順等輪、裝到棉州沔陽黄粗絲三十八件、分春葆太和等絲棧、至於海外市場、日絲貶價該銷、進行益力、各絲織廠需要不起、華絲去電價昂、歐美絲銷仍無生氣之可言、内地綢門亦以年關已屆、亦無進胃、市氣停滯、實乏市况之足紀、</p>
<h3>人造絲進口逐年减少</h3>
<p>丨最近交易亦屬清淡丨</p>
<p>年來人造絲銷路　將天然絲取而代之、致每年輸入、恒在一千萬兩以上、據海關報告、最近四年來輸入統計、有逐漸减少之象、其原因在生絲之價格日跌、及人造絲進口稅增高、輸入數量中、以意大利居第一、次爲德國及日本、計一千九三零年進口總數爲一二七、○九一擔、價値一五、二七九、八五七兩、一九三一年爲一二三、三四九擔、價値一九、○五九、六七五兩、一九三二年爲一○三、三八八擔、價一一、四○四、六三○兩、本年一月至六月爲四六、二三四擔、價四、二八九、八七八兩、近以年關將届·人造絲進胃益淡、昨祇美亞等廠進金麒麟黑美女等牌二十箱、價扯丨百七十九元七角半凈盤、</p>

<h3>論大出喪</h3>
<p>— 姚克</p>
<p>中國大出喪的儀仗，各地稍微有些不同，例如：南方有開路神，北方有雪柳；但都是好看，熱鬧。</p>
<p>大出喪中最有趣的是三敎合一的制度。魂轎中的神主是儒敎的象徴；夾在儀仗中的和尙道士，代表着釋道二敎的權威。中國人側底聰明，把儒釋道三敎兼收並蓄；死人的靈魂不成聖則成佛，不成佛則成仙，好比打三十六門花會，總有一門着。</p>
<p>外國人可就傻了。同是信奉一個上帝，偏要分出天主敎，耶穌敎，回回敎，猶太敎等等的派别。各派的信徒都是鳥眼雞似的各不相容，不懂得調和，兼收，打三十六門的妙法。所以外國人的靈魂可就有孤注一擲的危險，假如撲一個空，就得墮入十八層阿鼻地獄，萬刦不得超升。</p>
<p>大出喪中肩旗打傘的夫役也很耐人尋味。他們都是上海人所謂「癟三之流，在平時是蓬頭垢面；身上的衣服非但是髒得「有玷國體」，而且破得「有傷風化」。但在大出喪時，他們却頭戴紅纓帽，身穿繡花袍，冠冕堂皇，氣勢十足丨雖然袍襟底下還是一雙泥腿。</p>
<p>大出喪中最重要的似乎是棺材中的死人。棺木之名貴和歛物之豐奢，自不必說；單說龍賴鳳尾仙鶴頂，八八六十四槓的排塲，也就夠瞧的了。但棺材中的死人雖出足風頭，其實只是一個幌子；功布中「禍延顯考」的孝子們纔是大出喪的主角。雄糾糾的保鑣是只保孝子不保死人的，便是全副儀仗也不過是壯孝子的威風，何嘗爲死人的體面！</p>
<p>孝子們在訃聞上雖說「苫次昏迷」，「泣血稽顙」，其實在大出喪時，神志並不錯亂，也未必眞有什麽眼淚。欠「麻衣債」的孝子在功布中當然開心得合不攏嘴。便是不欠麻衣債的孝子，心裏正怙惙着請律師打遺産官司的大事，那裏還把「顯考」的遺囑放在心上？卽使遺産已經分派妥協，還須盤算蓋新洋樓，娶姨太太…………</p>
<p>孝子們享受遺産，果然是樂不可言；喪家的賬房，保鑣，家奴，甚至於一般執事，和尙，道士，鼓手，樂隊，帮閒的，和肩旗打傘的「癟三」們也都撈着些油水，皆大歡喜。</p>
<p>至於看出喪的人們，雖飽了眼福，却未免要喫些苦頭。丢鞋落帽和扒去皮包，都還是小事；若不幸而發生踏傷孕婦或迷失小孩等慘劇，也只能「打落門牙向肚裏嚥」罷了。</p>
<p>有人說：最好没有看出喪的閒人，就不致於有慘劇。話雖不錯，但旣無人看，也就没有大出喪了。</p>
<h3>肉與皮鞭</h3>
<p>— 馬國亮</p>
<p>看海京伯馬戲團表演的時候，我彷彿有點莫明其妙的感覺。最近無意中在電影上看到了他們訓練野獸的情形，才恍然大悟。現在把牠大略記出來。</p>
<p>幕開：寫着「獸類在學校中」的字樣，寫着海京伯訓練禽獸的方法的字樣。</p>
<p>Ｆ，Ｉ，虎檻外站着海京伯，對觀衆說了一堆話。說的話，有的是聽不清楚，有的是記不清楚。不過大意不外是說訓練野獸要有很大的苦心，很大的忍耐等語。隨後便起始把訓練的方法映下去……</p>
<p>看戲不像聽話（而且是外國話），所以看得很清楚。可是我的記憶力也是一樣糟的，有許多處雖然看得清楚，也同樣犯了記不清楚的毛病。不過有一點現在和將來都不會忘却的是：訓獸者永不脫手的肉塊與皮鞭！</p>
<p>白衣的女訓練師把一塊肉放在一個墩上，離這墩約一丈多的地方還有一個墩，上面站着一隻虎。於是女技師在兩墩之間拿了一個大圓環，一方面讓老虎看見了肉塊，　一方面皮鞭在抖着，於是世人稱爲男猛的老虎也便俯着帖耳，跳着穿過了圓環，躍到對面的一個墩上，把肉塊攫到嘴裏。這是老虎穿環的訓練法。</p>
<p>再來一套，把肉塊用線縛着，像釣魚般的向着狗的嘴。左手拿肉，右手拿皮鞭，於是狗便和人一般的站立起來，還能夠跳舞。</p>
<p>再來一套猫上扶梯，熊踏自由車……自然，其中肉餌和皮鞭都是在一起的。雖然有些地方電影的畫面上没有顯現出來，然而從起始以至於訓練成功，你會說他不用這兩件法寳麽？</p>
<p>肉塊之後有皮鞭，皮鞭之後有肉塊，還有輕輕的愛擁，於是老虎也疊起羅漢來了，猴子也會跳舞了，狐狸也會打拳了！</p>
<p>坐在我後面的一位先生忍不住對他的同伴嘖嘖稱奇，說海京伯的手段高明，但又慨嘆老虎的怯弱。</p>
<p>不知怎的，我覺得這人眞蠢。我想告訴他，海京伯所用的並不是一個什麽了不得的聰明的法子。這不過是一個老方法。從許久以前一直到現在，已經有許多人在用着，並且都和海京伯的一樣有效。我還想呌他趕快回家裏拿鏡子照照，看看自己有没有點像那老虎的臉或是那狗的頭。</p>
<p>自然，這不過是心裏想想而已，並没當眞的對他說。我怕他也呌我照照鏡子的時候，自己可眞没有拿鏡子的勇氣！</p>
<p>忽然我又想起「亡魂島」。想起那一羣飽受了酷刑而被造成人形，被作爲奴隷的野獸，結果認識了他們的主人也和他們一樣地會死去，終於在「再没有誡律」的怒吼之下而擊殺了他們的暴君，我不覺有點替海京伯及其手下擔心。</p>
<p>假如那些虎豹態獅等也有一天知道了他們的力量是勝過一根皮鞭，更知道毁滅了皮鞭之後將會得到更充足的食物呢？</p>
<p>海京伯已經離開了上海。我也没有意思打電報去警告他·並且，你想他會聽信我的話麽？</p>
<p>我覺得我自己也正和那嘖嘖稱奇的人一樣的蠢！</p>
<h3>納蘭成德的詩論（續）</h3>
<p>— 陳業</p>
<p>四</p>
<p>納蘭成德對於詩的基本理解是如此。他從這一基點出發，寫詩塡詞，並研究古代的詩歌，因此，往往有許多精粹的議論。在「淥水亭雜識」裏，他批判了許多的古代詞人，如枚乘，阮藉，庾子山，陶淵明，謝眺，昌黎，王建，劉禹錫，東坡，山谷，歐陽修，辛棄疾，元遺山，趙文敏，揚鐵崖，元遺山，以至於李後主，在對這些人的批判裏，他有許多很好的意見。許多人稱納蘭成德是李後主的再世，首先就介紹他的「李後主論一吧：</p>
<p>花間之詞，如古玉器，貴重而不適用。宋詞適用而不貴重。李後主兼有其美，更饒烟水迷離之致。</p>
<p>宋人把放翁比太白，而他則說「十不得三四。」對於蘇辛，他則說，「詞雖蘇辛並稱，而辛實勝蘇，蘇詩傷學詞傷才。」對於楊鐵崖樂府，則云「别是一種奇特之文，謂之樂府則不可，李賓之亦然。」評趙文敏詩，說「不獨在元人爲翹楚，在宋可比晏同叔。」而對庾子山與歐陽修，更比論之說：</p>
<p>庾子山句句用事固不靈　，六一禁絕之一事不用，故遂至於澹薄空疏，了無意味。</p>
<p>在這些地方，都可以看到納蘭成德論詩的卓見。對於右詩和樂府，他論及的也不少，如說「漢人樂府多濃譎，十九首皆高澹，」「焦中卿妻，又是樂府中之别體，」特殊是對於少陵樂府的意見：</p>
<p>少陵自作新題樂府，固是千古傑人。</p>
<p>這論斷和他的詩論的見解的合致，是最容易看到的。納蘭成德批評古代詞人，在表現獨創精神的地方，持論大都是如此的强調。</p>
<p>五</p>
<p>對於各代詩總的批評，納蘭成德也有許多意見。如論宋詞云：「自五代兵革，中原文戲凋落，詩道失傳，而小詞大盛。宋人專意於詞，實爲精絕。詩其塵飯塗羹，故遠不及唐人」。這論斷當然不能說没有問題，因爲宋辭之興，絕不是僅止由於這兩種原故，可是，在有許多地方，也是「獨有所見」的，如另一條說：</p>
<p>雅頌多賦，國風多比興：楚詞從國風而出，純是比興，賦義絕少；唐人詩宗風騷，多比興；宋詩比興已少；明人詩，皆賦也，便覺牌腐少味。</p>
<p>納蘭成德明論樂府，也頗有興味，很多條都是涉及此問題，有意見，有說明有懷疑。他指出樂府係漢武所立之言名，非詩禮後人以爲詩禮。又說，大抵古人詩有專爲樂歌而作者，謂之樂府；亦有文人偶作，樂工作而歌之者，亦名樂府，又謂，樂府題，今人多不能解，則不必强作；李于鱗優孟衣冠，徒爲人笑。這些意見，也許一部分是有根據的，都可以使我們看到他刻苦研究的態度。同時，在淥水亭雜識裏，說明了不僅樂府可歌，詩詞曲都曾有歌唱的極聖時代</p>
<p>宋人歌詞，而唐人歌詩之法廢；元曲起，而同廢，南曲起，而北曲又廢：今世之歌，鹿鳴塵，飯塗羹也。</p>
<p>史詩，在淥水亭雜識裏，也曾論到，而且提供了一些很有研究的意見。在納蘭成德的意見，是要有意而不落議論，一有議論，那就成了史評，他又說，詠史只可用本事中事，用他事中事，須賓主歷然，若只作古事用之，便不當行，要具文見意，以其意在文中，更不出意也，乃爲高手：都是他的史詩作法論。</p>

<h3>兩兄弟（六）（五）</h3>
<p>— 莫泊桑著李維克譯</p>
<p>哲安立刻站起來：</p>
<p>「我没有瘋，可是我受夠了你的臉嘴了。」</p>
<p>筆爾嘲弄他道：</p>
<p>「你受夠了？難道你是陸太太的一部分嗎？」</p>
<p>「你得知道陸太太快要成爲我的妻子。」</p>
<p>另一個笑得更猛了！</p>
<p>「啊！啊！好極了。我現在才知道爲什麽我不應當再呌　「寡婦」。可是你用了一種奇怪的方法來向我遵知你的婚事啦。」</p>
<p>「我不准你說笑…你聽到嗎…我不准你說笑？」</p>
<p>哲安走了近來，臉色蒼白，聲音發抖，他是被這種繼續攻擊他所愛的，他所選中了的女人的諷刺激怒得更厲害了。</p>
<p>可是筆爾也突然國樣暴怒起來。所有積在他心上的那些　力的忿怒，壓住的怨恨，近來克制着的反感和沉默的悲痛等都湧上了腦中，使他像充血了似的　腦錯亂了。</p>
<p>「你敢？……你敢？……我命令你給我閉住你的鳥嘴，你聽見嗎，我命令你給我閉住你的鳥嘴！」</p>
<p>哲安料不到他這樣猛烈，刹時沉默着，他在那當我們盛怒時所遇有的昏亂的思緒裏尋找那可以一直刺傷他哥哥的心的話語和字眼。</p>
<p>他努力使自已　靜着以便打擊得更有力量，盡力使他的話說得緩慢以便聽去更覺銳利：</p>
<p>「我好久以來就知道你嫉妬我，從你開始呌她「寡婦」的那天起就知道了，因爲你懂得這稱呼是使我　過的。」</p>
<p>筆爾發出了他慣於發出來的那種尖銳的輕侮的笑聲：</p>
<p>「啊！啊！天啊！我嫉妬你！…我？…我？…我？…我嫉妬你什麽呢？…嫉妬你什麽呢？…天啊！我嫉妬你的臉孔呢還是嫉妬你的頭腦？……」</p>
<p>可是哲安知道他已觸着他的傷口了：</p>
<p>「對啦，你嫉妬我，你從小就嫉妬我：你看見這女人選中了我而不要你的時候你便暴怒起來了。</p>
<p>筆爾被道種推測激惱得話都說不清了：</p>
<p>「我…我…我嫉妬你？爲着這個蠢東西，爲着這個混賬女人，爲着這隻肥鵝？……」</p>
<p>哲安看見自己的話打中了他，便繼續說：</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>勸戒烟文</h3>
<p>— 吾</p>
<p>長久不寫談言，心頭總覺得癢癢的。一方面固然因爲如今是祗談風月的年頭，寫文章的人必須要有一番頌揚讚嘆的工夫，譬如風調雨順，國泰民安之類。可是慚愧得很，這對於我眞是外行，没有辦法，祇好擱筆。但是另一方面，也的確是懶不過，（不敢說忙。）因此便索興認定萬事如意。其實到底是因爲無事可談，幸而這一次費了一個早農的工夫，方想到這麽一個四平八穩的題目。</p>
<p>勸戒烟，和勸戒嫖戒賭完全一樣，未嘗不是積陰功的事，於是益覺於心安矣。</p>
<p>近來我的確是這樣，每見吃烟的朋友吃烟，我便誠心誠意的而勸之曰：「朋友，戒烟罷，何必吃呢？」然而每次都是一樣，朋友立刻回答我說：「你勸我戒烟？你爲什麽不勸你自己呢？」眞的，想來甚覺好笑，鴇母敎娼妓做良家婦女，不是誰也要笑出眼淚麽？然而我到底還是勸人戒烟，並作戒烟文，没有十足的理由，是不肯如此大膽的。</p>
<p>再說遠一點，我並非不知道勸人戒烟是十分罪過的事。譬如就拿我自已來說罷，没有錢買菜，吃不放醬油的豆腐都可以，但是烟却不可不抽。特别是右手拿筆在紙上寫些什麽的時候，而左手却不能不夾一根金鼠牌，否則便不能寫滿一張五百字的稿紙。於此可知，烟草之對於弄筆墨的人，眞是太有因緣了。</p>
<p>再說罷，打五百剷須抽烟，坐在大世界聽媛媛的清唱須抽烟，與老朋友談世情須抽烟，打茶會須抽烟，上厠所拉屎也須抽烟，讀「啼笑姻緣」或「愛力圈外」更須抽烟。……如此這般，烟之爲益大矣哉！豈可戒乎？</p>
<p>可是最近聽着一個姓人可何的朋友說：「我們還是戒烟罷」，這一來提醒了我，烟，在中國眞是再吸不下去了。當時是這樣的，我說「爲什麽要戒烟？」他說得好，「你還不知道嗎？因爲勦匪捐的原故？紙烟又加價啦。」就是那天晚上，半夜醒來，小便一次再上床，暗暗的吸上一根紙烟，不免想起日間事，便仔細盤算一番。現在的金鼠牌，是十五個銅板一盒，以十根計算，剛好是十五個大錢一根。零買的話，三個銅板兩根，用不着找零。可是加價起來，那至少要變成每支大錢十七文了。五十個錢買三根，烟紙店一定不幹，百二十文買七根，又没有那個道理，算來算去，不是四個銅板買兩支，便是每支大錢二十文。這樣下去，烟紙店因爲能多賺幾個錢，固然嘻笑顔開，而吸烟的人却未免倒霉。至少要從每天抽十支的癮量中少吸兩支，才不會超出每月的預算。</p>
<p>進一層說，還是以戒烟爲妙，因爲捐錢殺人，到底是損陰德的事啊！萬一戒不下來，那也祗好改吸外國烟了。爲什麽？其理至明。</p>
<p>附帶的聲明，在本文中並不勸人戒絕鴉片紅丸。這固然是對於他們毋須勸告，而有錢抽鴉片的多捐大洋買毒氣砲，爲公即是爲私，又何樂而不爲？</p>
<h3>談生活</h3>
<p>— 木</p>
<p>偶然的在腦膜上浮現着生活的問題，想了一下，過去的生活，現在的生活，以及將來的生活……種種現象種種問題就有如春潮般將腦海掀起了巨濤與波浪。</p>
<p>過去的生活丨兒童的黄金時代那是無限甜蜜的，令人記憶起來越想越好，可是越想越懊喪與悲哀，兒童的黄金時代是再不可得的了！少年的青春時代那也是無限甜蜜的，在學校裏頭讀書，運動，游山玩水，甚至還談戀愛，享盡了人生的無憂無慮最美妙最快樂的幸福，丨也是令人喜歡記憶的，也是越想越好，又是越想越懊喪悲哀，少年的青春時代是再不可得的了！</p>
<p>脫離學校生活，踱進社會來，一切苦酸辛辣的味兒都嘗過，丨雖然有時也嘗過甘甜美妙的味兒，丨那就令你一天只是爲生活而掙扎，與社會作奮鬥，回憶起來没有好處只令你感傷，憤恨；悶懣了！</p>
<p>現在的生活呢，社會環境壓得你透不出氣來，假定你不識相或不留心根據你的思想說出來，那就蘆箭兒與毒瓦斯，造謠與誣陷，明的暗的襲擊總攻，令你安心吃飯過生活都不可能了！怎得有如天空的飛鳥與水中的游魚那樣的自由快樂呵！</p>
<p>現在的生活是這樣，將來的生活難道就會好的嗎？一想起就未免令你氣喪！人與人之間爲什麽要這樣的排擠，嫉妒，仇恨，攻訌呢？各爲理想，各行其是，就說不能夠的話，互相親愛，互相帮助的事總可以的吧？爲什麽大家不朝向這互相親愛互相帮助的一途走呢？只要思想與眼光向遠的地方想去，誰的理想會不一樣的呢？人們犯的就是近視病，只看眼前，不求將來，於是乎爲了眼前的生活而起衝突，因之而人與人之間發生了排擠，嫉妒，仇恨，攻訌的事，因之而人生之道苦矣！因之而人人對於現在的生活都感受壓迫，人人對於將來的生活都感覺渺茫人人如此，其實即是，個人一個人的思想行動造成的，莫怨他人，是你自已造成你的生活如此啊！</p>
<p>大家打倒近視病，眼光放遠呢，呐喊着。</p>
<p>那末，大家的理想是一樣的，大家互相親愛，互相帮助，大家的生活都快樂，社會上的一切魑魅魍魎的鬼魔都抱頭竄耳而逃了，社會是一個多麽美麗光明的社會啊！</p>
<p>爲了生活，大家應該朝這光明的路上走！</p>

<h3>皮袍子</h3>
<p>— 士本</p>
<p>這個「祗奉衣衫不奉人」的勢利時代，「衣」的問題，是多麽的重要啊！尤其是在機關裏辦事，人家都說「場面人」，「衣」的問題，更覺關係重大！祇要你身上穿得稍爲寒酸一些，包管人們就會　不起　！同事們就要傾軋你了，反之，穿得漂亮些，也就受人奉敬，同事們也處處和你親熱了。這是現今勢利社會上的普遍的惡劣現象，誰也都知道的啊。</p>
<p>我服務的是一個報館，裏邊四五位同事，彼此苦瓜碰苦瓜，文丐生涯，大家一樣的寒酸窘迫，所以；倒也没有誰瞧不起誰的事情發生　衣服的好　　也就滿不在乎。但是，爲了職務上的關係，天天必須和外界接觸，於是，衣着也有問題了。爲了有幾　穿得蹩脚了，跑去採訪新聞，總是落人家一個「不屑與語」的結果！說得吞吞吐吐，不盡不實，那裏有正確的消息給你訪着？心中氣極了，回來想想，「衣着」竟是採訪新聞的重要之套！倒不可不加注意呢？於是從此對於衣服，也就講究了，領來的薪水，也就大半化費在「衣」的上面。苦啊！這兩年，爲了綳這窮塲面，累得我筋疲力盡，欠了一身債，日日夜夜在担心事。唉！「身上綢翩翩，家中没有夜飯米，」素向儉樸的我，現在居然也和上海鄭家木橋老弟兄的樣子一樣了。</p>
<p>這兩天，西風已起，氣候驟寒，世界上的一切景物，都變了樣子，人們更忙　做　　　的作，有錢的富人們，皮呀！綿呀！火爐，水汀，也　應時而誕生了。可憐一　　　場面的我，這時身上還穿一件駝絨袍子，早夜走在路上，寒風刺骨，冷露裂膚，深深地感覺大自然的冷酷的脅迫。每一次西北風刮面時，就想起氣候已這樣地嚴寒，駝絨袍，已是落伍了，還穿着，走到人家面前，不是又要給他們瞧不起麽？但是，脫了這件駝絨袍，呌我拿什麽來替代呢？去年穿的一件黑羊皮袍子，不是在上春爲了房東太太催索房錢，而拿去質在「一六銀行」了麽？現在打算去贖出來穿，可是當本二十塊錢，呌我一時打那里來呢？至於報館裏二十塊的月薪，每個月拿來開銷夫妻倆的生活銷費，油鹽柴米房錢人情，一切的一切，在這生活程度高貴的時代，還夠什麽用呢？所以；上年起始，早已在當當，借債，天天度着「寅吃卯糧」的日脚了。那麽，下個月即使有二十塊錢的薪水可以到手，也不能有餘錢去贖這件皮袍了；但是，不贖，又不興，一則，天冷下去，一件駝絨袍子，究竟不能禦寒啦，二則，場面要緊，大冷天，不穿皮袍子，太丢臉了，况且，同事劍秋，天梅兩人，昨天不是忠告我麽；「你錢緊做緊，這件皮袍子，總得要想法贖來穿的啊，因爲：一個人在社會上辦事，這虛塲面總要綳的呢！假使你今年果眞不穿皮袍子，人家背後就要說：某人今年弄得蹩脚了，皮袍子還没上身，於是人們就會瞧不起你，你的名譽，也就因此而大受影響了。我原知道，在這：「祇奉衣衫不奉人」的社會上，一件皮袍子，的確，是很關重要的，穿不穿，關係着名譽的得失啦！但是，我今年這窮場面，却有些綳不住了，二十多塊錢，籌劃了多天，還没有着落，當當，没有東西當了，借債，也已没地方鑽了，眞是羅掘俱窮，呌我還有什麽法想呢？這兩天，爲了這皮袍子問題，憂愁得我日不思食，夜不安眠，悲哀痛心，一籌莫展，唉！物質的壓迫，竟有這樣地深刻啦！</p>
<h3>說道路</h3>
<p>— 易</p>
<p>從租界走到咱們政府統治下的華界，第一椿不快的事，就是馬路不同。租界的馬路下了雨只是濕的吧了，華界的馬路下了雨那就泥濘不堪，難道就是馬路亦有國貨與舶來品之别嗎？今年上海的商界同胞，尤其是綢緞業在喊破喉嚨宣傳着「國貨年」：同時國民政府財政部在發行建設航空公路發財票，不知道凑集的錢將來確實地建設起公路來（航空的此地不說）是不是還要造出一些國貨馬路來？這一層，在下雖然愚昩，很想貢獻，愚者千慮必有的一得。旣然說是建設公路，華界的馬路自然不同，可是莫提起公路，一提起公路來，那一種崎嶇不平的道路，天晴則風沙飛揚，天雨則泥濘濺水，誰處的公路不是一樣的腐敗？假如發財票凑集下來的扣頭眞實地提去建設公路的話，我想至少是該造成一條全國的模範公路，地基堅實，地面都蓋柏油，那末行旅稱便，行起公其汽車來也令人不至提心吊膽撞傷屁股與五肝六腑。切切不可建設國貨馬路。</p>
<p>說起公路行公共汽車的話，令人聯想起汽車與道路的關係。有一個呌做道路什麽會的，不知道是私人組織的還是公欵設立的，他們在開展覽會的時候除了宣傳着道路之外還特别地宣傳着外國汽車，我以前疑心那是美國福特汽車大王津貼的，現在才知道那是没有多大關係，丨就是與外國汽車公司有關係的話也不足爲奇。夫道路一經建設，必然的是在於行車，而國貨的獨輪木車與雙輪馬車已受淘汰，汽車的需要無疑義的理應贊成：汽車者國人尙未有設廠製造，其採用舶來品的汽車也其理至明且顯而易見。這樣一來，宣傳建設道路也就理正義順地應該宣傳外國的汽車，誰敢非議。而且國産汽車雖然還没有設廠製造，已經應用外國機件凑成公共汽車的却有，可是那些國貨是怎樣的不經用不耐久，那裏趕得上外國汽車的好？中國要建設道路就得購用外國汽車，這是識貨内行的智識，所以不敢獨佔特獻國人而宣傳起來。理由何等的充足透徹高深正大？然而，這也不去說他，橫堅於人有益於己無損的事，這是咱們貴國的國粹道德，我也贊成。所謂於人有益的人就是國際上的帝國主義，也是正合咱們國民政府的國際技術合作的精神，更應該大大的擁護。不過，咱們中國的實業界的資本家同胞，爲什麽不合資設廠製造汽車以與外國的汽車競爭市塲挽回利權這才怪呢。有人說咱們中國的民族資産階級的資本是已經受了國際帝國主義的金融勢力所支配與壓迫着了，他們處在這半殖民地的國家是没有辦法翻身抬頭的機會，所以才弄得工商百業不振，這話說來恐怕也有道理，那麽政府旣然要建設公路，何妨就連行公路的汽車也製造出來呃？假如由政府設廠製造汽車，一方面對舶來的外國汽車提高關稅，汽車這生意也是一筆大利源呵丨那末，現在國民政府財政部發行的建設航空公路的發財票，最好是改爲建設公路與汽車的名義，而將那一大筆錢財用之於建設公路與製造汽車。我想區區這愚者千慮必有的一得，一定是大多數同胞所贊成的了。其原因就是建設航空於咱們小百姓實在没有什麽利益可言，設若買了飛機不去找帝國主義那敵人周旋而内戰起來在咱們小百姓頭上生蛋，這是更加應該不贊成的。</p>
<h3>我的未來的計劃</h3>
<p>— 一之</p>
<p>今年雖是國貨年，但也可說計劃年：你看，東一個計劃，西一個計劃，計劃似雨後春筍日甚一日的産生出來，可是計劃着甚麽呢？這是各就自己的地位而定的，大槪黨國要人所計劃着的，除造别墅，娶太太之外，不外乎安内攘外，福國利民，像廣州的××三年計劃，中央的××整個計劃，便是安内攘外，福國利民的計劃。軍人們所計劃的，除搜括之外，不外乎擴大地盤，伸張勢力。資本家所計劃着的，不外乎以仇貨，充賣國貨，以大減價欺騙買客，那布爾喬亞階級所計劃着的，不外乎閒逸，享樂，只有那般窮苦朋友，到現在還没有計劃，大槪他們要計劃也無哈計劃的緣故。總之，計劃在今日是和摩登女郎穿皮領大衣，一樣地風行了，一樣地摩登了。</p>
<p>我不是黨國要人，也不是所謂專事搜括，享樂那一類人物，本來夠不上有計劃的資格，不過，我想到計劃並不限於目前的，未來的一切，不妨預先計劃　，於是，我有未來計劃的預擬；</p>
<p>（一）多寫頌讚地方長官的文章，因而受着他們的青睞就可投筆從戎，</p>
<p>（二）不論國政，不談軍事，專寫馬庇文章，專做風月詩詞，那便不致有甚麽危險。</p>
<p>（三）長年居在家裏，不越雷池一步，因爲在這安内期間，跨出家門，便要吃馬路上捕盜的流彈，所以要出去，也須戴頂鐵盔，穿件鋼甲，以防不測。</p>
<p>（四）呌我的那個姣艶婀娜的妹妹，多走走跳舞塲，多進進電影院，一旦得着大人先生的愛憐，我也可靠裙帶關係的福。</p>
<p>（五）我開的是一爿國貨商店，却也不可不備東洋歐美各貨透魚目混珠，影戲冒充，是商人發財的不二法門。</p>
<p>（六）不惜巨資，討個明星做姨太太，好把我的聲望提高，而且可以使人羨慕我的艶福不淺。</p>
<p>照以上的計劃進行，十年之後，我不是一個社會的紅人，我須是阿木林。</p>

<h3>上海（二）（四）</h3>
<p>— 張老三</p>
<p>（三十六）闖禍坯</p>
<p>一輛電車駛來，抒斷了話上車。頭等車廂中除了賣票之外，祗有我們兩個乘客。我佔據了車廂的一角慧姊坐在我身旁，買票的時候，她一摸袋裏笑了對我說，「一個錢没有帶。」我望了她一眼，付錢買了兩張軍票·没有說話</p>
<p>「我不預備出來的。」表姊接着說。</p>
<p>「這樣送客太誠意了。」</p>
<p>表姊低下頭去。暫時沉默着，車很快的向前駛去。</p>
<p>福開森路站上進來一個白種人，異國情調的震飛路已顯在眼前，車將近駛進第二站，表姊從袋裏摸索着掏出一封信來授給我，態度那樣慌忙，說了句「這是你寫給我的信」，被對面的高鼻子注視着，就紅了臉望着窗外。車已在第二站上停住，擁進一羣乘客，車廂中頓形熱鬧起來，我也没有機會看那退回的信，隨手往衣袋中一塞，直到呂班路下車。</p>
<p>今天是星期，社中來了許多朋友，當我們踏進去的時候，弟弟挽在小黄的𩓐子上·羣雜亂的聲喊着「戀愛萬歲」。慧姊兩條腿連奔帶跳的竄到敬姊跟前，握住她的手問她怎末一回好笑的事，這種瞬息萬變的態度，在後面慢步走進客廳的我簡直莫名其妙。</p>
<p>小黄拉下吊在𩓐子上的弟弟的手，顧慮着什麽似的逃上樓去了，我還没有注視到他，高飛喊起來：</p>
<p>「闖禍坯又逃了！」</p>
<p>笑風和重慶等記憶起三角戀愛的禍事，望着對立着的敏姊和慧姊，再移動視綫射到我面前來，似乎告訴我這裏取笑着的是什麽事。這時候處在萬分嫌疑地位的我，不敢說一句普通的話，因爲或者就爲了一句普通的話而引起莫須有的誤會。當我走近桌邊抽起一枝烟來，兩位敵對行爲的敏姊和慧姊向衆人打個招呼跳着上樓去了，看情形雙方　堅守着陣線。</p>
<p>室内頓時沉默，高飛拉我到沙法上坐下，告訴我早上走了之後，敏姊四處尋你，中飯也没有吃，不過她還没有生氣到面上來，我們的朋友正以三角戀愛打趣她哩，你却眞的到慧琴那裏去的？</p>
<p>我點點頭，自己也不知表示「是的」彧是「我曉得了」，站起身來，在客廳内來往的躅着，烟尾燃着我的手指，纔隨手向痰盂中抛去。</p>
<p>第二枝烟接上我的手，還是在室中往來的躅着，茶房阿福從樓上下來，他問我：「李先生吃蛋炒飯？」</p>
<p>「飯開過了」我望着高飛等說。</p>
<p>「快兩點鐘了，李先生。徐小姐說你也没有吃飯。」</p>
<p>「好的。」我抬起頭來壁上的掛鐘差五分鐘就是兩點了。</p>

<h3>梅薇絲私生活的透視</h3>
<p>— 嘉殻</p>
<p>她外表露著絕頂的浪漫</p>
<p>但内心確是極端的正派</p>
<p>梅薇絲（ＭaeＷest）的儂本多情一，（Ｉ'mＮoＡngel）在國泰演完了，接着又在卡爾豋連映幾天好像風靡了美國之後，又來風靡我們中國，使不少上海的影迷，都在她迷惑浪蕩之中，陶醉了兩小時。凡看過梅薇絲影戲的人，所得的印象是什麽？對於她個人的私生活，猜想起來，大槪是怎樣的？恐怕大家總以爲她一定是位極端浪漫不覊的女子吧？這亦不能怪大家。本來美國各種電影雜誌，對於梅薇絲的個人生活，已經有許多宣傳，故意說得疑雲疑雨，使人不可捉摸。其實那些却是影片商人宣傳的技巧。據說梅薇絲自己確是一位規矩的女子。有三個電影演員，他們都和梅薇絲合演過戲，和她在銀幕上接過吻，他們現在這樣出來證明。</p>
<p>梅薇絲在未到好萊塢之前，本來是百老匯舞臺的一顆明星，而和她在舞臺上演過戲的，有一位亞奉爾温頓（ArthurVinton）。他和梅薇絲合演過許多名劇，現在亦不一一舉出名字來了。他說：「當我被派了去和梅薇絲接洽合演的時候，我起初極不願意，因爲我覺得她是一位很不易接近的女子。但是我爲公事起見，終於去見她了。不料我和她接談之後，我就發現了她確是一位實事求是的女子。她在最女性的身體表面，具有一個最男性的腦筋。這就是她偉大的地方。她腦筋的敏捷，眞如手槍上的機鈕，無論你說什麽話，打什麽主意，她總追在你們的前面的。至於外面的種種傳聞，那都是不確實的。她的幾個特點是：遵守時刻，工作不怕勞苦，待人謙恭有禮，從來不自大。而一般同事的對於她，亦是極有禮貌的，因爲她並不是可以隨便胡鬧的人。無論什麽時候，人家總是稱呼她一聲薇絲小姐，而没有人單稱她一個梅字的。而她的稱呼人家，亦總加一個先生的稱呼。至於說她是個富有誘惑性的女子，我可以說，凡是和她接近過的，就可以知道那是不確的。」</p>
<p>大凡生性淫蕩的女人，她的心一定是很毒的，但是梅薇絲的心，却是仁慈無比的。她常常不惜自己的金錢，和自己的精神，去救濟人家。她能夠體量人，帮助人，絕對於有自私自利之心。以下係一位賈克拉樂（Jack　la　Rue）的話。他和梅薇絲在（ＤiamordＬil）合演過影戲。他講的是他自己怎樣能做梅薇絲配角的故事。那個時候，梅薇絲正在尋覓一位西班牙少年。他是意大利人，但是一個很好的演員。他的合同快滿了，他急急乎　尋件事做，而做梅薇絲的配角，確是最好不過的希望。於是他就去見梅薇絲了。梅問他是不是西班牙人。他回答的是幾句西班牙話，在電車裘速成學會的。她又問他會不會表演。他說他願意當面試試他的丨丨本領。於是他們就當場表演了一下。表演完了，梅薇絲說：很不壞，很不壞。　她就問他什麽時候，可以開始試演。賈克說他在一家公司有長期的約。梅薇絲就很奇怪，旣和别家公司有長期的約，爲什麽來見她呢。賈克說要是錢多的話，他情願放棄長期的約，來和她合作。梅薇絲於是一切都答應了，而賈克的薪水，亦很大，出乎他自己意料之外的。不過他們試演了幾次之後，她一切都調查清楚了。她知道他不是西班牙人，他亦没有什麽長期的成約。顯然的係她受欺騙了。但是她並不恨他。她反而看見了他；哈哈笑着，她說一個人到了没有路走的時候，偶然掉個槍花，是可原諒的。因此賈克對於她，感激就萬分了。</p>
<p>還有一位羅蘇哈狄（ＲuasellＨardil），他和梅薇絲在銀幕上或舞臺上，合演過多少戲。他亦證明梅薇絲是個極正派的人。他從來没有見過她在舞台或銀幕之外，做過淫蕩的態度。她喜歡開開玩笑，尋尋開心，那是有的，不過她從來没有失掉過旁人尊敬之心。她的利用「性」來表演，是别人所及不到的，亦是旁人所不敢做的。除掉梅薇絲之外，别人要想學她，非但絕對學不到，並且還有許多危險。她的不落入雜要班，或是更卑賤的地位，而能得到她現在高崇的地位，這就是她偉大不可及的地方。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「惡鄰」</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>丨月明出品，卡爾豋開映丨</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>首先我得和「惡鄰」的劇作者法西先生商榷，中國所以弄得如此破碎，眞個完全是因爲接受了西洋物質文明，擯棄了國粹的舊道德，以致於國亡無日的嗎？我覺得這是作者最大的觀念錯誤。</p>
<p>我們可以肯定的說，所謂舊道德，所謂精神文明，一定是經濟基礎的上層建築。現在現濟制度已經由農村經濟發展到資本主義。那末上層建築的舊道德，必要的隨着經濟制度的變換而改換本質，卽是說，舊道德决不會在現有的經濟制度之下面繼續發生效力，這和封建帝王不能在資本主義社會中存長，乃是同樣的理由。舊道德已經自然的消滅無遺，而物質文明亦必然是現社會最合理的産物。很明顯的，舊的祇有毁滅，新的在猛速的生長。這是鐵一般的歷史的决定，誰也不能忽視的。</p>
<p>那末，在中國爲什麽會有異樣？難道說，農村經濟在中國並不曾遭受毁滅嗎？</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>因此，中國所以貧弱，中國所以被割宰，决不是因爲舊道德沉淪，或是不應該接受歐西的物質文明。唯一的理由，乃是中國現在的地位是一個半封建的半殖民地的地位。</p>
<p>不錯，「惡鄰」是表示反對强鄰的侵略的，但是以猛隘的國家主義爲前提，已經是此路不通，何况作者有如上的錯誤的認識呢？</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>以上，因其錯誤點的嚴重，所以不能不比較嚴格的指出。我想這是批評者指示觀衆最主要的責任。事實上知識水準過低的觀衆們，是會因其歪曲而走上錯誤的路上去。</p>
<p>此外，我極不同意作者純粹以象徴的方法來處理這種問題。譬如說以惡鄰代表日本，鄕議會代替國聯，「鍾國芬」爲中國魂，「黄華仁」爲黄華人，「白金濟」爲白種人的經濟，「鄔質華」爲物質，「蔡馬夫」爲某某等民族英雄。因爲如此，完全失掉了嚴重的意義和積極性。固然在目前一切都不自由，然而在可能範圍中仍應當正面的描寫。</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>在攝製技巧方面說，月明公司的確比以前略有進步，不論在攝影上，表演上或是佈景上。然而他們畢竟始終迷戀着打武，（據說是小公司爲着南洋和内地的銷路。）這在打武的技術上已經不敢稱讚，而就這一點說，和最近開映的「六集女鏢師」又有什麽分别呢？我以爲不放棄打武，始終是月明公司的損失。</p>
<p>就個别演員來說，那末以飾黄華仁的那位最好，次如王飛娟也還自然。</p>
<p>（五）</p>
<p>此外說明書上的「蕭伯納的幽默，希特勒的悲壯」等，我以爲不是高明的宣傳方法。又如所謂「幽默字幕」者，也多數是片中看不見的</p>
<p>再則要附帶說的，就是昨天第一場，有二位日人在那裏很熱心的看，並且我聽見他們談話很爲憤慨。於此可知，日人對於電影是十分注意，眞所謂有心人無微不至了。</p>
<h3>「歐洲大戰史」評</h3>
<p>— 摩爾</p>
<p>Ｈells“Ｈoliday”</p>
<p>Ｆriche在二十世紀歐洲文學中說：帝國主義文學的意特沃羅基的構成的主要部分之一是「暴力與戰爭之讚美」。這不一定是文學上得到明顯的例證，就是電影上，也同樣反映出來。他們切要的手段，就是把戰爭美化，强調羣衆的國家觀念，抹然戰爭慘酷的塲面。</p>
<p>但是，隆隆的大砲聲中，一批一批死去的只是勞苦的大家們。美麗的欺騙，再也當不住事實的襲擊。於是優秀的作家，就「向戰爭所引起的虛僞殘酷的血塊之上，落下了眞理的鐵槌打擊」。（高爾基）亨利巴比塞的小說「火線下」，就描寫着國際戰爭到革命戰爭的轉變。而痛定思痛，雷馬克之流也寫出他的人道主義的「西線無戰事」，幷且很快的就攝成了電影。</p>
<p>國際政治家預言的一九三六年的大戰，將在遠東展開了序幕。在這時候，每一個角色，都「摩拳擦掌」的「準備厮殺」。於是很快的把歐戰的舊課，先温習一番，一方面當時的新聞片，已失了時間性，正好經過了剪接添加的手續，成爲新片再來賣錢。這種影片最近出現得很多，「興豋堡血戰史」，是有名的，目前我們更看到這一張「歐洲大戰史」。</p>
<p>眞如廣告所稱的一樣這部片子，是實地攝的。因爲本來是新聞片，不過一個客觀存在，經過一度製作，已經有主觀注入了。換一句話：就是已經說出了作家對於這個存在的意見了。現在我們在「歐洲大戰史」裏，看到的只是大砲的威力，而没有人民的災難。卽使我們也看到烟霧飛騰，但是似乎只是形成這「威力」，這「奇觀的條件，於此，可見製作者的用意，以是温習舊課」，幷不是對於舊事的悲痛。這自然可以說是因爲當時的新聞片的關係，但正因爲是當時的新聞片的，對於戰爭的讚美，而我們的作家採用他，是更正確的說明了意義。</p>
<p>在最近「非戰影片」是有人在反對了。自然，只有戰爭能夠消减戰爭，但是我們要注意的只有革命的民族戰爭，是我們應該擴大，而帝國主義互相的强盜戰爭，和干涉戰爭，我們是應該反對的。假使另有作用的提倡「殺人」「喝血」的戰爭，那只有使民衆陷入萬刦不復的境地，結果是穩固了特權者（帝國主義及其他）的地位。第二次世界大戰的爆發，是指顧間事了。從「歐洲大戰史」中，我們是看到了他們的陰謀！觀衆們！「不在戰爭中，直到戰爭爲止，必須結成兄弟」！（巴比塞）我們是反對帝國主義戰爭的！</p>
<h3>天下丈夫們聽者</h3>
<p>— 西復</p>
<p>美國紐約的垣街，有一位富翁，呌史提芬愛姆斯（ＳtephenＡmes）他因爲量大福大，所以被好萊塢認爲「百萬丈夫中一之也」了。什麽道理呢？講來是很有趣的。史提芬有一位如花似月的夫人，她在兩年前就要到好萊塢去拍影片。史提芬因爲她請求了多少次，不忍拂逆她的意思，就慨然答應了。那位夫人就是赫赫有名的亞德麗愛妮愛姆斯（ＡdrienneＡmes）。但是一位女明星，若是缺少了一位男性的伴侶，在社交上面，是極不方便的。但他自已身居紐約金融界重要的地位，天天發着大財，怎能放棄了自已的地位去陪伴他的明星夫人呢？於是他又聽了他夫人的話，同意於請了一位新進的影星勃羅斯開博（ＥruceＣabol），作他夫人正式的男伴，以便出入於交際塲中。後來勃羅斯和亞德麗愛娜漸漸由友成愛，漸漸形影不離了。於是史提芬又特爲這件事，跑到好萊塢，替他們作月下老人，而自己退居於朋友之列。聽說勃羅斯和亞德關愛娜，經道了史提芬一番的勸進，不久就要結婚了。這種大公無私的精神，豈不是可欽可佩的嗎？</p>

<p>（一）一件小事情</p>
<p>下午四時，大都會的動脈跳動得最劇烈的時候。汽車接連着電車，電車接連着汽車：從摩天大樓的頂上往下望：是兩條直線地相對着爬行的螞蟻的陣………</p>
<p>這時候一家外資創辦的紗廠裏正在忙碌，原動機的電流通着，大大的輪軸牽引了皮帶無休無息地循環着走。紡車底下坐着一排女工，每一個人的手都在機械地動作，緊張的臉，微笑的臉，帶着憂鬱性的貧血的臉。皮帶盤底下的拾紗的孩子。丨據說孩提是人生的「黄金時代」，而這些童工的「黄金時代」就是在拾紗的工作裏消磨的。</p>
<p>突然丨迅速地旋轉的皮帶上帶出了一件衣服，猛劇地抛上空間。接着有一聲尖厲的慘呌，在沉重的機輪聲中發出。</p>

<p>「三十九號軋傷了！」「三十九號軋傷了！」</p>

<p>「不要緊吧？」一個流淚的女工的臉，惴惴地看着醫生。可是醫生不說話，他的頭輕輕地搖着。</p>

<p>「這也用得着報告嗎？自已不小心，有什麽好說的！」這樣回答了，便把聽筒一擱。顧自已悠然地翻看着報紙上的戲目廣告：</p>

The issue of the various passes along the Great Wall was not discussed this time. There are currently about one battalion of Japanese troops stationed at Gubeikou, with the regimental headquarters in that area. Due to the lack of barracks, they have not withdrawn outside the pass. The Japanese troops stationed at the office address of the Luan-Yu Commissioner's Office in Tangshan have also not relocated due to the lack of barracks. Although Tao Shangming has negotiated with me, it is difficult to handle. Tao may seek another office address in Tangshan. (20th Special Telegram)</p>

<h3>A Glimpse of the Situation in Rehe</h3>
<p>(Beiping) According to someone who came from Rehe, the Japanese have been actively developing transportation in Rehe recently. The train has already been extended from Chaoyang to Lingyuan. The plan to extend north from Lingyuan to Chifeng for more than 600 miles has been completed. It is planned to complete the Rehe railway system by the end of March next year. Currently, the county magistrates are not allowed to interfere in administrative power and can only manage the seals of office. The Japanese have established more than a dozen clubs in various counties, which include gambling dens and brothels, exclusively for Chinese people to enjoy, and they are granted special protection rights. Each county has four heroin factories and one opium monopoly office, which are distributed among the households according to quantity, requiring at least one person in each household to smoke opium or heroin. The activities of the Righteous Army have not ceased. Liu Zhendong's force of over a thousand is engaged in fierce battles with the Japanese in the Chaoyang 3rd and 4th District territory of Rehe, causing heavy casualties to the Japanese. Recently, due to the inability to replenish ammunition, they retreated to Fuxin. Jin Jianren's force of over two thousand is engaged in fierce battles with the Japanese army in the Laoha River area of ​​Chining County, causing more than 70 Japanese casualties. They seized more than a dozen vehicles and demolished important bridges. Currently, soldiers of the Manchurian puppet army, due to the various inhumane treatments they receive from the Japanese, are thinking of defecting to the government, but have no opportunity.

<p>(Beiping) Manchuria is again rife with rumors that Puyi will soon be proclaimed Emperor, still using the Qing Dynasty as the national title, and that the date has been fixed for January 1st next year. These rumors, of course, cannot be verified by any reliable source. However, they are now widely circulated. Such rumors have been repeated many times over the past twelve months, and the masses have become accustomed to hearing them. But they all believe that the Japanese will sooner or later make Puyi Emperor. It is even said that the provinces of North China, at least Hebei and Shandong, will be incorporated.

<h3>Postal and Telecommunications Cooperation Measures</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the issue of postal and telecommunications cooperation, in order to save expenses and facilitate people's communications, the Ministry of Communications recently proposed a plan for postal and telecommunications cooperation in remote rural towns. This plan involves establishing post offices and telegraph offices in the same location and operating in the same building in areas with small scale and simple operations, in order to save rent and other operating expenses. The main objective is to enable people to send telegrams and mail letters in the same place, so as to avoid the trouble of running around separately. The funds, personnel, and systems of post offices and telegraph offices will each maintain their original systems and will not be mixed. The measure is actually postal and telecommunications cooperation, not a postal and telecommunications merger. (20th Special Telegram)</p>

<h3>Organizing National Steel</h3>
<p>— A note</p>
<p>The issue of a national steel factory has been advocated for a long time within our country. The Ministry of Industries had previously drafted a contract with three German companies, namely, Xiwang, Meng'aen, and Maidi, to establish the factory. Recently, in view of the needs of the current situation, discussions were held on December 15th at the General Staff Headquarters in the capital. On the 18th, further discussions were held in Beijing on "the commencement of construction, selection of machinery, the amount of capital, and the draft contract." It is said that the location has also been selected near Wuhu and Dangtu, close to the Yangtze River, for convenient transportation and sales. Based on this, a steel factory is imperative. However, if our country does not engage in heavy industry, then so be it. If we do engage in heavy industry, then its policies should not aim to expand sales or open up markets as the objective of its operations. Since the occurrence of the world economic panic, the more developed the heavy industry of major industrial countries, the greater the impact of the panic they have felt. For example, in the American steel industry, only one-half of its production equipment is currently in operation. Moreover, the price of its products is extremely cheap, more than one-third lower than in 1929. Today, if our country establishes new factories, with workers who are not skilled and equipment that may be incomplete, the goods produced will inevitably struggle to compete in the market. There is no other way but to explore a different path, focusing on national defense plans, regardless of market relations, disregarding general needs, and concentrating on the production of production tools and construction. Perhaps this is the way to operate.</p>
<p>Do we not remember the past events of the "Hanyeping Iron and Coal Company"? Apart from the Pingxiang coal mine, which is far away in Pingxiang, Jiangxi, the iron ore in Daye is very close to the production site and the ore is abundant. The iron content is unparalleled in the world. But why did it fail? Firstly, it was affected by the import of foreign goods. There was no suitable sales market in the country, and the price of the products was higher than that of imported goods, so people generally bought foreign goods. Secondly, there were operational failures. Although Hanyeping was nominally a joint venture between officials and merchants, it was actually equivalent to being government-run. All the malpractices of government agencies were present in Hanyeping. The unwarranted consumption was high, making reasonable operation difficult. Thirdly, it was restricted by foreign loans. Its ore and products had to be sold to Japanese factories at low prices. With these three factors, the factory itself was deeply mired in a situation where it could not recover, and our country's only heavy industry was therefore difficult to develop.</p>
<p>In terms of the general development process of industry, although our country is still in the early stages of light industry development, if the world market competition were not so fierce and the domestic environment did not hinder economic progress, the operation of heavy industry would not be impossible to gradually advance. However, under today's circumstances, trying to engage in the development of heavy industry from a purely economic standpoint has a difficult future. Therefore, I believe that today, only by focusing on national defense can we overcome the aforementioned difficulties and open up a new direction. Because national defense construction is purely consumption, it is absolutely impossible to consider whether the operation is profitable or not. Moreover, what our country should focus on building today is not necessarily the addition of fortresses, the construction of warships, and various direct military equipment, but the production of production tools, the development of transportation infrastructure, and the reconstruction of the general national economy. The gradual progress of our country's industry is an undeniable fact. If the government can provide appropriate assistance, the future development can be expected. Currently, the transportation industry is generally focused on, but the government's encouragement of automobile transportation seems to have limited effectiveness in long-distance transportation. If we want to achieve the true development of national strength, the consolidation of national defense, and the flexibility of military operations, the construction of railways is essential. If there is a determination to build railways, then all steel materials should naturally be supplied by the national steel factory, and the future operation of the steel factory can be worry-free. However, there is still one thing that seems small but is actually big. What may not need to be considered in European and American countries should be paid close attention to in our country, which is to prevent the bureaucratization and corruption of the steel factory's operations. This emerging enterprise bears the great responsibility of national defense in the future and opens up the foundation for national operations. Every penny, every item, every drop of molten iron, every piece of steel, and the appointment of every employee and servant must be consistent and rationalized, with absolutely no waste or negligence. Only then can we gain the trust of the people and establish the foundation of this great industry.</p>
<h3>The Issue of the Dalai Lama's Succession</h3>
<p>Tibetan Political and Religious Affairs</p>
<p>Temporarily Under the Charge of the Silong Kasha</p>
<p>The British Side Claims the Dalai Lama Was Poisoned</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the issue of the Dalai Lama's succession, Tibetan traditional concepts, politics and religion have always been inseparable. The Dalai Lama holds the great power of politics and religion. Upon his passing, during the transitional period before the Dalai Lama is established, the Tibetan political and religious affairs will be temporarily maintained by the Silong (equivalent to the Prime Minister) Kasha, with the assistance of the four Jie Silongs (equivalent to the directors in the Executive Yuan). After the reincarnation of the Fourteenth Dalai Lama, he will be recommended to preside over political and religious affairs. The system of succession, according to Tibetan religious interpretations, is that although the Dalai Lama dies, the Dalai Lama's soul will never perish. Whether the Dalai Lama is passed down through several generations, it is still just one Dalai Lama reincarnating. Although the Thirteenth Dalai Lama has now passed away, he had already foreseen when he was dying that in a certain year, month, and day, the Dalai Lama's Kubilkan (meaning reincarnation) would be born in a certain place as the Dalai Lama's successor. It is said that this prophecy was extremely secret before the Dalai Lama appeared. Since the death of the Thirteenth Dalai Lama, orders have been issued to various places to follow the Dalai Lama's prophecy and search for the Fourteenth Dalai Lama. The words and actions of the person being searched for must be completely identical to the Dalai Lama's dying prophecy in order to be a true system of succession. The Tibetan representative in Beijing said that the Dalai Lama had drafted a will a few hours before his death. The main idea of the original text was that the Dalai Lama advocated maintaining Buddhism and not allowing foreign Christianity or other religions to take the opportunity to invade and disrupt the Tibetan Buddhist system. He also instructed the Silong Kasha to uphold the Dalai Lama's lifetime advocacy and continue to vigorously support the central government in order to maintain the relationship between Han and Tibetans.</p>
<p>A brief biography of the Dalai Lama: The Thirteenth Dalai Lama's name was (Ngawang Lobsang Thupten Gyatso). In the second year of the Guangxu reign, he was reincarnated in the Mingdun family under the command of the Qiying officials in Dining. In the fourth year, the title of Kubilkan was revoked. In the sixteenth year, the Resident Minister in Tibet, You Tai, and the British agreed on a treaty of trade between Tibet and India. In the nineteenth year, the Resident Minister in Tibet, Kui Huan, renewed the trade treaty with the British. In the twenty-first year, he was ordered to be in charge of commercial affairs. In the thirty-first year, British troops entered Tibet, and the Dalai Lama fled north. The Qing Resident Minister in Tibet, You Tai, requested the removal of the title of Dalai Lama. Initially, the Dalai Lama arrived in Beijing to pay homage in the thirty-fourth year of the Guangxu reign and was given the title (Most Sincere, Obedient, Praising, Transforming Western Heaven Great Benevolent Self-Existing Buddha). In the second year of the Xuantong reign, the Dalai Lama sought British protection and went to Darjeeling. The Qing court then revoked the Dalai Lama's title on the sixteenth day of the first month. In the sixth year of the Republic of China, there were frequent conflicts between the Kang and Tibetan armies. After the establishment of the National Government, Gongjue Zhongni was sent to Tibet to convey the central government's good intentions. The Dalai Lama then appointed Gong as his representative to work in Beijing. (20th Day Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Dalai Lama passed away in Lhasa at 7:30 PM on the 17th. According to his representative in Beijing, after the Dalai Lama's passing, the office received a telegram from Tibet and reported the original telegram to the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission of the Executive Yuan. All Tibetan religious and political affairs are temporarily the responsibility of the two Silong Kasha. The Dalai Lama enjoyed a lifespan of 58 years. Colleagues and others were extremely saddened by the news. Rumors that conflicts had broken out again in Kang and Tibet were due to misunderstandings. After explanations from both sides, they have been quelled and they continue to be divided by the Jinsha River, with each guarding their original defense. The contents of the original telegram are as follows: (1) To the Nanjing Tibetan Office in Beijing, The Dalai Lama's Buddhist seat passed away at 7:30 PM on the 30th day of the Tibetan lunar month (December 17th in the national calendar). Tibetan affairs are temporarily the responsibility of the Silong and Kasha. Hope you can work with peace of mind and report to the central government. Details will be sent in a separate telegram.

<p>(London) According to a telegram from the Daily Mail's correspondent in Malingpang, the Tibetan Dalai Lama was actually poisoned to death by his enemies. It is claimed that this news was obtained from reliable sources in Lhasa. If the Dalai Lama was indeed murdered, then turmoil will occur in Tibet. It is reported that two years ago, the lamas in Tibet revolted in the name of opposing the harsh restrictions imposed on merchants, causing the Dalai Lama to flee from Lhasa to other temples. Later, he finally agreed to their demands and exiled his close confidants from Tibet, which brought the situation to rest. The Dalai Lama then returned to Lhasa. (30th Day National Telegram)</p>

His foresight was especially evident in sending young Tibetans to England to study engineering and other professions. Yang Hhusben also praised Sir Charles Bell for establishing the special relationship between Britain and the Dalai Lama. Bell was formerly a political officer for Tibet, Bhutan, and Xikang.

<h3>Australia Sends Telegram to Inquire About China's Imposition of Import Tax on Foreign Wheat</h3>
<p>(London) The Australian Kang Bailai of the London Times telegraphed today, saying that it is heard that the Chinese government intends to levy an import tax on wheat and flour starting from December 18, collecting seven pence for every 133 pounds. The Australian customs is quite surprised and has telegraphed Nanjing to inquire about the truth, because the Chinese government originally intended to levy a flour tax of five pence per 100 catties starting from January 1, while wheat was exempt from tax. If the rumors are true, the Australian market will be greatly affected, as most of the wheat produced in Australia in recent years has been sold to the Far East. It seems that Australia should send personnel to Shanghai to protect Australian interests. (20th Day Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>(Paris) French Ambassador to Germany, Arna, arrived here this morning with the German reply and has presented the documents to the Confidential Secretary of Foreign Minister Peng Gu. The content is a kind of written note, but the requirements for the number of troops and weapons are not formal diplomatic documents of the German government. These documents are expected to be sent to the ambassadors of Britain and Italy at the same time. After receiving them, the French government will hold a cabinet meeting to discuss them and then send instructions to the French Ambassador to Germany, Pongse, that are in line with the situation. In addition to the items mentioned in the previous telegram, the content of the German note also recognizes that the party army of the National Socialist Party is subject to international supervision, but only if military groups other than the official armies of other countries are also subject to supervision. Regarding the Saar mining area, Germany requests that it be returned to Germany without going through a referendum, but the mineral resources and other properties there will still be controlled by France before 1935.

<p>(Paris) The documents that the German government sent to the French Ambassador to Germany, Pongse, regarding the armament issue were taken back yesterday by the Chief Counselor of the French Embassy, Arna. The newspapers paid great attention to this matter, saying that this document is not a diplomatic note from the German government, but only that Hitler sent his opinions to the French ambassador in writing after talking with Pongse. The Chen Bao said that the French government does not need to reply to this proposal with another note, but only needs to instruct Pongse with its opinions, which is sufficient. In addition, the newspapers all believe that the German submission will undoubtedly faithfully express the German views and are convinced that the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs will send these documents to London and Rome at the same time. The newspapers all agreed that the various demands made by Germany cannot be accepted. The Excelsior said that the German note contains the maximum demands, intending to leave room for maneuver so that Britain and Italy can mediate. The Business Daily said that the German demands are a formal attempt to rearm, while French policy advocates security first, then disarmament. In comparison, the German proposal cannot be recognized at all. All eyes are focused on the meeting between British Foreign Secretary Simon and French Foreign Minister Peng Gu at the end of this week. (20th Day Havas Telegram)</p>

<h3>French Parliament Passes Military Preparedness Reorganization</h3>
<p>Active Troops Number 468,000</p>
<p>Recruiting 15,000 Technical Specialists</p>
<p>Enlistment Period to Increase by Four Months</p>
<p>(Paris) During the European War, France's birth rate decreased. By 1936, there was a significant shortage of adults eligible for military service. To remedy this, the government drafted a bill to increase the conscription age by four months. Today, the Chamber of Deputies passed this bill with a majority of 449 votes to 147, allowing the Army, Navy, and Air Force to change the conscription age. The bill also stipulates the recruitment of 15,000 individuals with specialized skills to compensate for the shortfall in military personnel. During the discussion, former Prime Minister Tardieu stated that this bill was a temporary measure and of little practical effect. However, his statement was refuted by Mr. Foburi, the chairman of the Military Affairs Committee, and also by Minister of War Daladier, whose speech was warmly received. Tardieu briefly stated that some people believe France cannot defend itself and are spreading rumors to unsettle the public, which is a mistake. France currently has a standing army of 468,000 men. In addition, there are reservists and troops available for conscription, totaling 500,000, all of whom have received complete training. The funds approved by the Chamber are to be used to procure modern military equipment. Without this equipment, soldiers would only be sacrificed, repeating the mistakes of 1916. France's defense organization is unparalleled in the world and in history. Minister of War requested the Chamber to approve further funding so that defense facilities could be extended to the coast. Daladier does not believe that a nation can be destroyed and subjected to tyranny by an army of 500,000 men. Daladier continued, saying that the comprehensive strength of the nation's young men is the primary energy of the country. The current issue is how to arm, command, and conscript these young men under the best possible conditions. Daladier continued, "No matter how complex the situation, France must be able to observe the changes calmly and be able to cope with any unforeseen events. The bill proposed by the government is very clear." Daladier concluded, "Regarding military affairs, the Chamber has two paths: either follow the government's request and pass the bill to remedy the inadequacy of military personnel, especially to recruit model troops to strengthen border defenses; or, if not, then the term of military service will be increased to eighteen months or two years. You must choose for yourselves," and so on. After several people spoke, the Chamber finally agreed with the government's opinion (Havas dispatch on the 19th).</p>
<p>(Paris) Former Prime Minister Tardieu, while debating in the Chamber of Deputies today on the proposal to postpone the conscription of recruits from 1934 to 1936, stated that the spring of 1934 would be a perilous time for Europe and France. He opposed reducing the size of the army in the spring of 1934, saying that France urgently needed military strength to ensure peace. Minister of War Daladier replied that France could ensure its own safety because there were 468,000 soldiers listed on the active duty roster and 500,000 reservists who had received complete training. France also had excellent new weapons and defenses, unprecedented in French history. It is reported that France intends to postpone the conscription of recruits from 1934 to 1936, the purpose being to increase the number of recruits conscripted from 1936 to 1940, because the birth rate in France from 1915 to 1919 decreased, and it is predicted that there will not be many new recruits in the years before 1940 (Reuters dispatch on the 20th).</p>

<p>U.S. Navy Reorganization and Expansion Plan</p>
<p>The Coast Guard Directly Under the Navy</p>
<h3>U.S. Navy Reorganization and Expansion Plan</h3>
<p>The Coast Guard Directly Under Naval Command</p>
<p>Increased Appropriation to Build New Ships</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, Washington naval circles predict that the U.S. Navy is undergoing a reorganization and expansion plan. The visible signs are: (1) It is reported that the Coast Guard will be merged into the Navy; (2) The Marine Corps will be reorganized into a fleet combat team to be more closely governed by the fleets; (3) In June of this year, the U.S. President allocated $238,000,000 from the public works fund to build new ships, and then allocated an additional $57,744,490 for the expansion of the Navy. The news that the Coast Guard will be merged into the Navy was released today after a meeting at the White House between naval, Coast Guard, and Treasury Department officials. According to well-informed sources, this move will be in line with the government's policy of seeking to economize on administrative expenses. From the fact that the Navy was recently ordered to assist the Coast Guard in cracking down on liquor smuggling, it can be seen that the merger of the two is an important current task. It is heard that the Navy Secretary stated at the White House today that the Navy can handle most of the Coast Guard's work without losing its effectiveness. The Coast Guard was originally reorganized from the Customs Enforcement Team and the Life-Saving Team. Although it is under the command of the Navy Department, it is dispatched by the Treasury Department. In peacetime, its main duties are to suppress smuggling, protect taxes, rescue ships in distress, remove obstacles from waterways, and enforce navigation laws (National Telegram on the 19th).</p>

<h3>Pan-American Conference Passes Resolution Not to Interfere in Other Countries' Internal Affairs</h3>
<p>The United States, Peru, and Brazil Declare Reservations</p>
<p>(Montevideo) Today, the Pan-American Conference registered a resolution firmly opposing Western Hemisphere countries using interference in other countries as an instrument of government policy. The United States, Peru, and Brazil all declared reservations, but U.S. Secretary of State Hull declared that the United States was only temporarily reserving judgment, pending clarification of some of its clauses. However, it can be asserted that, while President Roosevelt is in office, countries need not worry about U.S. interference in their internal affairs. The reservations of Peru and Brazil are directed at the clause suggesting non-recognition of territories acquired by force, as they want to thoroughly research the clause to determine what impact it will have on the dispute over Leticia Port between Colombia and Peru before agreeing to it. Hull's declaration of reservation was also because he wanted to study whether this proposal contradicts laws containing the Monroe Doctrine and the Platt Amendment. However, Mexican Foreign Minister Casaurán had already publicly requested that the United States abandon the Monroe Doctrine and the Platt Amendment (National Telegram on the 19th).</p>

<h3>South Manchuria Railway Reorganization Plan Plunges Saitō into a Dilemma</h3>
<p>The Military and Various Ministries Hold Conflicting Views</p>
<p>South Manchuria Railway's Operating Surplus This Year Is 40 Million</p>
<p>North Manchuria Railway Network Plan Actively Underway</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Minister of Colonial Affairs Nagai recently formally expressed his opposition to the South Manchuria Railway (SMR) reorganization plan in his capacity as administrator. Minister of War Araki expressed that it must be reorganized. Other ministers, such as Finance Minister Takahashi and Foreign Minister Hirota, echoed Minister of Colonial Affairs Nagai and also expressed their opposition to the reorganization. Prime Minister Saitō is in a difficult position and feels very hesitant. He is worried that it will become a "cancer" within the cabinet and is quite anxious. Minister of Colonial Affairs Nagai, also aware of the seriousness of the issue, paid a special visit to the Prime Minister at his official residence at 3:00 PM today to discuss comprehensive countermeasures and to negotiate on the colonial budget issue (China United Press dispatch on the 20th).</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Colonial Affairs is absolutely opposed to the reorganization plan created by the SMR and the Kwantung Army in the first step. In the second step, if reorganization is necessary, the Ministry of Colonial Affairs should submit its own reorganization plan, using a two-step strategy to counter it. The Ministry of Finance also holds the view of opposing fundamental reform, and it is inevitable that there will be a head-on conflict with the Army, which supports the on-site plan. Its impact is bound to affect the political situation. At this time, attention is being paid to the attitude of Minister of War Araki. Minister Araki's belief in supporting the Saitō Cabinet has changed since the Five-Minister Conference and the Internal Affairs Conference. He believes that there is no need to maintain it. Therefore, even if some revisions are made to the SMR reorganization plan, most of the original plan will inevitably be recognized, and it will move forward bravely beyond the fate of the current cabinet in order to achieve the plan (Dentsu dispatch on the 20th).</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The SMR Company held a shareholders' meeting this afternoon. President Hayashi said in his speech that the company's income this year reached 23.3 million yuan, expenditures were 19.3 million yuan, and the surplus was 40 million yuan. The performance of the railways entrusted to it by "Manchukuo" and the Korean Governor-General's Office was also very good. Regarding the reorganization issue, the SMR itself did not propose a so-called reorganization plan. It only participated in the opinions on reorganization at the request of the Kwantung Army Special Service Department and provided investigation materials. The SMR Company is responsible for carrying out the mission of national policy and cannot lose its historical existence. It may need to be reorganized in the future, but the interests of SMR shareholders and creditors will definitely not be harmed, etc. (China United Press dispatch on the 20th).</p>
<p>(Tokyo) "Manchukuo's" railway network plan in North Manchuria, as well as the establishment of public order, have made significant progress. The construction status of each planned line is listed below: (1) The entire Rabing line was completed on December 16, earlier than scheduled, completing the connection with the Hu-Hai line. The Songhua River Railway Bridge, a difficult construction project on the entire line, is also nearly completed, so operations began in mid-January. (2) The Tai-Dong-Hailun line, which is temporarily in operation, has been completely rebuilt, and SMR began operations on December 1. (3) Combine the Hu-Hai line, the Tai-Dong-Hailun line, and the Qi-Ke line, and divide them into the Bin-Bei line and the Qi-Bei line. Both lines are open to traffic to Beian Town. (4) Among the Duntuo lines, the northern loop line has been formally entrusted to SMR for operation by the "Manchu" government since August 31. It is merged with the Jichang and Jidun lines and renamed the Jingtu line. It is currently open to traffic between Changchun, Jilin, Tumen (Huimudong), and Chongjin, with a line length of 700 meters. The Tiantu Road on the southern loop line is currently being converted to a broad gauge and will be completed in February of next year (Dentsu dispatch on the 20th).</p>

<h3>Marquess of Salisbury Proposes House of Lords Reform Bill in England</h3>
<p>Reduce the Number of Members and Increase the Power to Restrict the House of Commons</p>
<p>Prevent the Labour Party from Implementing Drastic Changes After Gaining Power</p>
<p>(London) The House of Lords met today, and there was a large attendance. The Marquess of Salisbury proposed a private bill to reform the House of Lords, advocating for reducing the number of members of the House of Lords and increasing the power of the House of Lords to delay legislative bills. Secretary of the Navy Hailsham replied on behalf of the government, saying that this bill should be discussed as soon as possible, but Labour Party leader Ponsonby said that this bill reduces the number of hereditary nobles and directly restricts royal prerogatives. He should first ask the British Emperor for instructions before proceeding with this bill. Liberal Party Marquess Reid also said that this bill will indeed restrict royal prerogatives. After discussion by the public, the House of Lords allowed the proposer, the Marquess of Salisbury, to explain the reasons.</p>
<p>Marquess Salisbury said that the House of Lords should seek methods to protect the country in order to prevent the recurrence of unfortunate events under the previous Labour government. Labour Party member Clynes once said that the next Labour government will abolish the House of Lords, so the House of Lords must take precautions against this. He only proposed changes in the organization of the House of Lords, striving for safety. Anything unnecessary will not be involved. This bill can give the House of Lords sufficient power to prevent the country from being thrown into the chaos of major reforms without having time to consider it calmly. This bill does not want to repeal the 1911 Parliament Act. This bill recognizes the constitutional principle that financial power belongs to the House of Commons and that final governance power belongs to the people, but financial bills or other legislative bills passed by the House of Commons may only be the judgment of the majority in the Congress, not the judgment of the people. It is proposed to organize a mixed committee of the two houses, with the Speaker as the chairman, to jointly determine currency cases, rather than the Speaker doing it alone. After the reorganization of the House of Lords, if an absolute majority rejects a case three times, the final decision should be made by the House of Commons established in the next session. The two houses have now established subcommittees to plan proposals that can make Britain safe from any hasty and dangerous changes. The current proposal is based on its proposals. Foreign affairs cannot be ignored. The old system is now deemed to be replaced by a dictatorship or a disruptive change. Britain must guard against the possibility of adverse changes in its own political system. The responsibility of the House of Lords is to reform its own organization to seek national security, so the House of Lords does only what is absolutely necessary. This bill proposes a large reduction in the hereditary members of the House of Lords, reducing them to 150, plus 150 non-hereditary members, plus royal relatives, religious leaders, and legal officials, for a total of about 320 people.</p>
<p>Labour Party Ponsonby moved to reject this bill, calling it a political deception that seeks to change the organization to benefit the party in power. He does not believe this bill can be taken seriously. This bill uses the reorganization of the House of Lords to seek to restrain future governments. He firmly believes that if this bill is passed, many industrial seats in the next election will be owned by the Socialist Party.</p>
<p>Liberal Party Viscount Esher said that this bill is based on an obviously wrong principle. Esher also mentioned the remarks made by Labour Party member Clynes, saying that the House of Lords does not need to worry about a gilded dictatorship, and Labour Party leaders should avoid the idea of dictatorship, because holding this idea will only destroy themselves.</p>
<p>Hailsham said that all cases are given a first reading, which is customary, so he advocated that this bill be established for the first reading, but this does not mean that the government or he personally supports this bill. The government has not yet considered this bill, so he cannot express the government's opinion on this plan. The House of Lords later approved the first reading of this bill by a vote of 84 to 35 (Reuters dispatch on the 19th).</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The preliminary meeting for the House of Representatives' Navy budget was held at the Navy Minister's official residence at 11:00 AM this morning. Deputy Speakers of the House of Representatives Akita and Uehara and about 30 representatives from various parties attended.

Longji Nagashima then questioned, what are the contents of the Manchurian Incident expenses, and will they continue in the future? The Navy Minister replied that the expenses referred to the expenses of the North China and South China Dispatch Fleets, the expenses of the Shanghai Dispatch Marine Corps, and the expenses of the Songhua River Dispatch Fleet and special agencies, and that they would continue temporarily in the future, etc. The meeting adjourned at 1:30 PM in the afternoon (Dentsu dispatch on the 20th).</p>
<h3>A Study of Bird Migration</h3>
<p>Germany's Cologne Region - According to the results of a study on bird migration by the Eisen Bird Observatory, it is proven that bird migration is a natural and automatic behavior. The bird observatory has been studying this interesting problem in the Rhine River region for a long time. Every winter, wild cranes form flocks and fly south to Africa. However, it was unknown whether this migration was due to instinct or led by older birds. Therefore, the observatory obtained 160 crane chicks, all taken from crane nests, transported them from East Prussia to Eisen, kept them there for 47 days, and then released them on September 12. After they flew out, most of them flew to the Ruhr area, where they rested for some time, as if preparing for a long-distance flight. Then, they flew south in groups, passing through the Rhine River region, then through southern France and into Italy. One of them was even found at an altitude of 6,500 feet in the Alps. Furthermore, according to reports from around the world on the study of bird migration, it can be said that it has been completely successful, and it proves that these chicks, after being raised for a long time, can still choose their direction and route to reach warm areas, without needing the guidance of their mothers.

(China United News Agency, 20th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) - After news spread that Minister of Commerce and Industry Nakajima intends to invite members of the Seiyukai and Minseito parties on the 25th, ostensibly to report on the Ministry of Commerce and Industry's budget and plans for the coming year, and to seek cooperation between the two parties to counter the military, Japanese reporters flocked to visit him. However, Nakajima said, "In order to rescue the political situation, political parties must be open-minded and should unite their forces with each other. They should not treat the military with respect and keep them at a distance, but must actively contact them. The Seiyukai and Minseito parties have quite a bit of resonance with my opinion. I am willing to take the initiative to bring them together, so that the military and political circles can unite and jointly plan national affairs, but how the future trend will be is really unpredictable."

<h3>Japanese Troops Invading Chahar Withdraw to Jehol Territory</h3>
<p>The Intention of the Japanese and Puppet Troops Is to Pursue Mutinous Soldiers</p>
<p>Chai Shan Visits He Yingqin to Explain Everything</p>
<p>Song Zheyuan Discusses the Incident in Eastern Chahar</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: The sudden intrusion of Japanese and puppet troops into eastern Chahar on the border of Jehol has drawn great attention from all parties. The truth has gradually become clear in recent days, and the matter has come to an end. The situation is described as follows:</p>
<p>A portion of the puppet troops in western Jehol suddenly mutinied due to the pressure of the Japanese army. More than 700 Japanese troops and more than 400 puppet troops of the 8th Division of the Japanese and puppet troops were ordered to pursue them, invading eastern Chahar from Dage and Datan in western Jehol. One unit reached Xifengyan outside Dushikou on the 14th. Huang Shouzhong and Zhang Junjie, two units of the cavalry detachment of our garrison troops outside Dushikou, withdrew to Longmensuo and Dushikou to await orders in order to avoid conflict because they did not understand the intentions of the Japanese. For a time, the situation in Chicheng was quite tense. Another unit reached Xinyingzi, Tianpinggou, and Weichenggou in the second district of Guyuan at 4:00 pm on the 12th. On the evening of the 13th, they clashed with Liu Zhenyu and Ma Jinliang, two units of our Guyuan garrison troops under Zhang Yunrong, at Hongshicha and Sandaochuan. Liu's unit suffered 3 deaths and 6 injuries. In order to avoid escalating the situation, Liu and Ma's units withdrew to Mingheng Beach to await orders. After discovering the attack by the Japanese and puppet troops, our soldiers at the front immediately telegraphed the province for instructions. Song Zheyuan, Chairman of Chahar Province, telegraphed his subordinates to strengthen their defenses and respond calmly. He also telegraphed Beiping for instructions.</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>The Japanese and puppet troops did not advance further after reaching Xifengzhai and other places. Gradually, starting from the 15th, they successively withdrew to Dage and Fengning. In recent days, there have been no traces of Japanese and puppet troops in Xifengzhai and the Hongshicha and Weichenggou areas of the second district of Guyuan. Our army is currently advancing to take over the defense. The incident in eastern Chahar is expected to come to an end.</p>
<p>After receiving the alarm from eastern Chahar, the Beiping authorities, in addition to telegraphing Song Zheyuan to respond as appropriate, also negotiated with Chai Shan, the military attaché of the Japanese Embassy. Chai Shan stated that the Japanese army's actions this time were due to the discovery of a large number of bandits in western Jehol, and that they were carrying out a joint suppression, and that they would not invade Chahar territory, let alone affect the existing relations between China and Japan. Once the bandits were suppressed, they would withdraw immediately. The authorities requested Chai Shan to telegraph the Japanese Kwantung Army to quickly withdraw the troops that had entered Chahar to avoid escalating the situation, and declared that this kind of action should not happen again in the future. If it was necessary to suppress bandits, they should be notified in advance to avoid misunderstandings. Chai Shan telegraphed our intentions to the Japanese Kwantung Army. Chai Shan returned to Beiping from Tianjin yesterday. At 10:00 am today (19th), Zhu Shiqin, a section chief from the Military Branch, visited Chai Shan at the Japanese Embassy. At 10:30, Chai Shan accompanied Zhu to Jurentang to meet with He Yingqin to explain the incident in eastern Chahar and to discuss the issue of receiving Shanhaiguan. He left at about 12:00 pm.</p>
<p>Since the occurrence of the problem in eastern Chahar, Song Zheyuan rushed back to Zhangjiakou from Zhangbei to take command. Qin Dechun was also ordered to return to Chahar from Beiping to assist in military affairs. Now that the Japanese and puppet troops have withdrawn east and order has gradually been restored in eastern Chahar, efforts are being made to deal with the aftermath. According to what Song said to reporters from Beiping and Tianjin in Zhangjiakou this morning, the Japanese and puppet troops that invaded eastern Chahar withdrew to the Dage and Fengning areas starting from the 15th, and the incident in eastern Chahar has come to an end. The Japanese and puppet troops' intrusion into the Chahar border this time was due to a mutiny by a portion of the puppet troops in Jehol, who crossed the border to pursue them, invading our army's defense area and clashing with our unit under Zhang Yunrong. Now that the Japanese and puppet troops have withdrawn, the Guyuan area has been extremely peaceful. Most of the bandits in Chahar Province have been suppressed, and the miscellaneous troops are being reorganized. Tang Yulin's unit has been reorganized to approximately 8,000 men. A portion of the unarmed soldiers have been transferred to Zhangjiakou for training. Tang himself is now in Zhangjiakou, expressing his willingness to hand over his troops to Chahar Province for control. Prince De of Inner Mongolia sent a letter to me on the 18th, requesting me to forward a request to the Central Government to quickly find a way to realize Inner Mongolian autonomy, etc. (December 19th)</p>
<h3>Xingbu Recovers Guangze</h3>
<p>The Northern Route Bandit Suppression Army Advances to the Fujian Border</p>
<p>Military Organ Announces Fujian Intelligence</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Since the Northern Route Army recovered Zixi and occupied Deshengguan, the situation on the border of Jiangxi and Fujian has changed. Previously, after the Fujian Incident occurred, Zhu, Mao, Peng, Lin, Fang, Shao, and other bandit gangs, since they did not need to take care of the southeast, used the false 3rd, 5th, and 7th Army Corps to try to break through the Central Army's central route towards Zixi and Lichuan. They also used the false 1st Army Corps and various independent divisions to detour around the right flank of the Central Army, and used the Northeast Jiangxi false 10th Army and the Yi-Gui independent divisions to try to cut off the Jiangxi-Zhejiang Road to respond to the Fujian side. However, from the 11th to the 14th, Lichuan, Yihuang, Zixi, and Guixi, among other places, were broken by the National Army's bandit suppression lines. The 58th and other columns, after clearing out the bandits in Lichuan and Zixi, took advantage of the victory and advanced eastward, crossing into Fujian to encircle and suppress them, hoping to sweep them away in one fell swoop. A telephone call from Fuzhou relayed information from the front lines that the Northern Route Army's troops under Xing Zhennan, Yao Chun, and Wu Qiwai, which were advancing towards Fujian, pursued the bandits to the vicinity of Guangze on the dawn of the 18th, and launched a fierce attack, killing many bandits and seizing more than 100 rifles. The remnants of the bandits fled in disarray towards TaiNing, JianNing, and Yanping, and joined up with the false 1st, 3rd, 5th, and 7th Army Corps. Xing's division recovered the county town of Guangze at noon on the 18th and immediately dealt with the aftermath. Since Guangze is connected to Chong'an and Shaowu, it can now be connected to Liu Heding and other troops in northern Fujian after being recovered by the Northern Route Army, forming a unified force with the Central Army on the border of Zhejiang and Fujian. From here, going east, one can directly approach Fujian.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to intelligence released by the Supreme Military Organ, "Deng Shizeng is in charge of the rebel's military affairs in northern Fujian. If necessary, Jiang and Cai will personally go to command. Chen and Li are carrying out a joint operation with the Red Bandits, with the Fujian Military Commission appointing Zhu De as the commander of the false 2nd Front Army and Cai as the commander of the 1st Front Army. Their troops are indeed moving towards the Gan-Zhe border in northern Fujian. The offices of the Lu Division and Zhou Brigade in northern Fujian in Fuzhou have been automatically withdrawn, which shows their support for the Central Government. The Fujian side is extremely panicked about air defense because its air force has no combat capability. Its air defense positions are Mawuichuanshi in the east, Yanping in the west, Putianquanzhou in the south, and Showningfuan in the north. Consuls from various countries are meeting in Xiamen from time to time, and a certain country is very eager to take over Fujian, using traitors to carry out activities in Fujian, but Chen and Li are completely unaware of it," etc. (December 19th)</p>
<h3>Sichuan Army Telegram Reports Recovery of Suiding and Xuanhan</h3>
<p>Bandit hordes split into two routes retreating towards Tongjiang</p>
<p>Yang Hucheng dispatched troops from southern Shaanxi to intercept</p>
<p>Deng Mingjie discusses crucial points for suppressing bandits</p>
<p>Hankou correspondence: The Sichuan Fifth Route Army recently crossed the Qu River, with Fan Shaozeng's division on the left attacking Suiding, and Zhang Huafeng, Li Guiru, and Xu Yaoqing's three brigades on the right attacking Xuanhan. Overall commander Wang Lingji was in the center, coordinating both sides. The bandits in Suiding and Xuanhan, recognizing the official army's fierce momentum, attempted to divert attention by attacking Sanhui with their main force. Meanwhile, they constructed strong fortifications at strategic passes such as Jiangkou, Fenghuang Mountain, Tazi Mountain, Chaqi Mountain, Ezi Han, Mazongtan, Zhangjiayan, Shiguyan, and Wenjialiang to disperse the official soldiers' attacking strength. On the 16th, the Fifth Route Army launched its third general offensive, successfully recovering Jiangkou, allowing rear units to completely cross the river. At dawn on the 17th, the entire bandit Ninth Army was ordered to counterattack, engaging in a desperate battle with Yang, Li, Liu, You, and Zhu's regiments on the right flank. Ultimately, due to the increasing number of official soldiers and the failure of the bandits attacking Sanhui, they collapsed and retreated upon hearing the news. Li's regiment then occupied Ezi Han, and Zhu's regiment occupied Mazongtan, gathering at the foot of Chaqi Mountain with Yang, Liu, and You's regiments. Simultaneously, Xu's brigade crossed the river from Luoweizi, linking up with Yang's regiment. Zhang's brigade occupied the Zhangjiayan and Shiguyan line, advancing towards Xuanhan City. According to reports, Xu Yaoqing's brigade was the first to recover the city that evening. The next morning, Li Guiru's brigade also recovered Chaqi Mountain. On the left flank, Fan's division had long attacked Fenghuang Mountain near Suicheng without success, so Zhang Huafeng's brigade joined the siege. Fan's troops detoured through Wenjialiang, directly crossing into Suicheng, which was also reported to be occupied on the 18th. Wang Lingji, the overall commander of the Fifth Route Army, telegraphed Hankou on the 18th to report the victory. The original telegram read as follows: "(1) Li Guiru's brigade, and Yang Qin'an and Zhang Jinghan's regiments, recovered Chaqi Mountain at dawn on the auspicious day. The bandits split into two routes retreating towards Tongjiang, with Xu's brigade pursuing. The Fifth Route Army had already recovered Xuanhan City by evening. (2) The air squadron bombed the bandits' retreat route, demonstrating its power. (3) Zhang Huafeng supervised his troops on Tazi Mountain near Suicheng, fiercely attacking Fenghuang Mountain. The bandits are resisting stubbornly, and fierce fighting is still ongoing. (4) Fan Shaozeng's division has already occupied Suiding City. (5) Xu Yaoqing's brigade recovered Xuanhan by night, and the bandits fled towards Tongjiang. Wang Lingji sealed at midday on the auspicious day." It is reported that Wang is now at Sandengpo in Kaijiang and is about to move the general headquarters forward to join the First, Second, Third, and Fourth Routes for a major offensive against the bandits. On the Shaanxi side, Yang Hucheng has also dispatched troops to make strict deployments. If the bandits flee to Shaanxi, they will be intercepted head-on from Hanzhong. (18th)</p>
<p>According to Deng Mingjie, the Shanghai representative of the Sichuan Bandit Suppression Commander-in-Chief, regarding the suppression of the Red Army in Sichuan, he stated, "I recently received a telegram from Chief of Staff Deng in Chongqing confirming the 21st Army's capture of Suiding and Xuanhan. This is a major key to suppressing the Red Army in Sichuan. In other words, it is a crucial battle for pacifying the Sichuan bandits. Because of the terrain, Suixuan is very important. The bandit army must occupy Suixuan if it wants to develop towards eastern Sichuan. If we do not recapture Xuan Sui, we will have no way to attack the three counties of Tongnanba, where the bandits rely on as their base. Otherwise, not only will we not be able to eliminate the bandit atmosphere, but it may also spread. Therefore, the Red bandits concentrated their main force in these two places and launched a fierce counterattack. The 21st Army began its offensive at the beginning of the month, fighting day and night, and finally captured the two places after nearly twenty days. From the results of this battle, we can see that the main force of the bandits has been defeated. After this, we can take advantage of the situation and attack step by step. The military situation is becoming more and more optimistic. The elimination of the bandit atmosphere in northern Sichuan will not be far away," and so on. Deng also showed the telegram from Chief of Staff Guo of the Chongqing Military Headquarters as follows: (1) Fan Shaozeng's Fifth Route Army attacked Suiding City with an independent brigade in the early morning of the sixteenth (auspicious), and launched a strong attack from Laoguanmiao with the Eleventh Brigade, engaging in fierce fighting for six hours. It was not until midday that they crossed the river and occupied the Chongshi Village area on the opposite bank. The bandits then retreated to the Wanghuangguan area and fortified the highlands. In this battle, over 6,000 bandits were killed. At the same time, Wang Fangzhou's troops attacked, and artillery and aircraft bombed the bandit fortifications along the river. After six hours of night fighting, Yang and Liu's regiments crossed the river, followed by Li and You's regiments. By this time, only one or two markets in Yingshan County had not been recovered, and only three or four markets in Qu County had not been recovered. There were no traces of bandits in the major and minor Pengshan mountains. Over 2,000 members of the civilian volunteer army burned down the bandit Changsheng puppet county government. (2) The bandits, considering Suiding to be in danger, launched four attacks on the left flank of Fan Shaozeng's division in the evening of the sixteenth (auspicious), failing to succeed. In the morning of the seventeenth (evening), our Twelfth Brigade launched an offensive and occupied the highlands in the Lanzhaizi area. On the morning of the eighteenth (auspicious), continuous attacks were launched on the various units on the right flank, who also crossed the river and pounced on the bandits. Although the bandits resisted stubbornly, they could not hold on. At midday (auspicious), the bandits withdrew from Suicheng, setting fires everywhere. Fan Nanxuan's brigade and Zhou's regiment pursued into the city without stopping, and the entire brigade continued to attack the Fenghuang Mountain and Baiyan area. Division Commander Fan Shaozeng personally led the special service battalion to extinguish the remaining fires in Suicheng and eliminate lurking bandits. (3) After Wang's troops Yang, Liu, and You crossed the river, in the morning (evening), the bandit's Ninth, Twentieth, and Thirtieth Armies launched a counterattack under the cover of fog. Lin Brigade and Li Regiment engaged in hand-to-hand combat. By night, the various units had advanced to Chaqi Mountain. Xu and Zhang's two brigades also crossed the river. The bandits retreated under the cover of night. Our Xu Brigade and official regiment advanced from the right flank and occupied Xuanqian City. In this battle, the official soldiers suffered about fifteen hundred casualties, and one regimental commander and two battalion commanders were injured. The bandits suffered heavy casualties, with corpses strewn all over the fields, and twice as many casualties. The various units continued to attack fiercely. According to captured bandits, Xu Xiangqian's entire army and main cadre troops are located between Xuan and Sui, with Xianglu Mountain in Shuanghechang. Aircraft reconnaissance reveals that the bandit fortifications in Xinchang Wangjiachang Shuanghechang are very large, and there are many bandits guarding them. The Fifth Route Army continues to attack." (Guowen News Agency)</p>
<h3>Yu Feng Cotton Mill's Petition to Chairman Chiang</h3>
<p>Concerning Workers Forcibly Taking Cotton Yarn</p>
<p>Submitting this petition in reply to a previous matter: This merchant factory previously submitted a document reporting the mediation process of a labor-management dispute and the workers' forcible seizure of cotton yarn, which hindered the bank's creditor rights, requesting maintenance. On the 18th of this month, we received document No. 676 from the Wuchang headquarters, stating, "Received and noted. This case, according to the telegram from Ruan Fancai, Administrative Inspector of the First District of Henan, states, 'Regarding the labor-management dispute at the Yu Feng Cotton Mill, since the factory manager Zhao Guifen returned to Zheng in the middle of last month, mediation has continued and the conditions of both parties are not far apart. However, according to the contract, the factory should pay the workers' living expenses during the shutdown period, which are more than two months in arrears. The workers' livelihoods are difficult, and after negotiations with the factory's Zhao Guifen, the workers have obtained his consent to extract 369 pieces of cotton yarn from the factory's inventory on a micro day to temporarily maintain the workers' lives. Mediation is still ongoing. In addition to reporting to the provincial government at any time, this is hereby telegraphed.' The facts in the telegram and the petition are inconsistent. In addition to ordering the Henan Provincial Government to investigate the facts and report them for further review, you should be informed of this order." Having received this order, we found that on the 5th of this month, the factory's labor union forcibly took 369 pieces of cotton yarn in the presence of government representatives. This cotton yarn is collateral handed over to the bank by the factory, and the mortgage right belongs to the bank, not the factory's own goods. Even the factory itself has no right to dispose of it. As for Zhao Guifen's trip to Zheng last month, it was on behalf of the factory's creditor, the American merchant Shenchang Foreign Firm, as the translator for the firm's representative stationed in the factory, Stinpe. It is obvious that he had no right to agree without authorization and was forced to sign. After this incident occurred, the Shanghai Banking Association telegraphed your seat, the Central Party Department, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Finance, the National Economic Commission, the Cotton Industry Control Committee, Chairman Liu of the Henan Provincial Government, and the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce on the 6th of this month, appealing for maintenance. The original telegram stated, "We have received a letter from our members, the Shanghai Branch of the Bank of China, the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, and the Xingye Bank, stating that the Zhengzhou Yu Feng Cotton Mill owes our three banks a large amount of debt, and the pledged cotton yarn is stored in the Yu Feng warehouse. The factory was previously shut down due to losses and has not been resolved for a long time. Now, we have received a telegram from our Zhengzhou branch stating that the labor union and the mediation committee have forcibly taken 369 pieces of pledged cotton yarn, intending to sell them to pay the workers' living expenses. The creditor rights of our banks are not guaranteed. Please find a way to stop this. The Yu Feng labor-management dispute has its own solution. The labor union's forcible extraction of the bank's collateral and the local authorities' failure to stop it will not only make it impossible for the banks in the area to operate, but also at a time when the government and the provincial authorities are working hard to promote construction and develop industry, how can we encourage the banks to do their best to assist? If our government does not quickly stop this illegal act, the banks will lose their guarantee and will have to stop all industrial loans, which will have an impact on the country's industrial future. Therefore, we appeal to you to order the Zhengzhou local authorities to quickly stop this and return the cotton yarn extracted by the labor union in full, which is what we hope for. Respectfully awaiting orders." The National Economic Commission, the Cotton Industry Control Committee, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Chinese Cotton Mill Federation, and others also telegraphed the party and government agencies separately, requesting maintenance. On the 12th of this month, the National Economic Commission, the Cotton Industry Control Committee, and the Chinese Cotton Mill Federation all received a letter from the Secretariat of the Central Executive Committee stating, "According to the telegram, the bad workers of the Zhengzhou Yu Feng Cotton Mill are taking advantage of the name of the whole and destroying the factory's building doors and locks, and taking out 369 pieces of cotton yarn without authorization. Please order the cotton yarn that has been taken out to be returned in full as soon as possible to protect the factory," and so on. We are submitting this document in response. We hope that you will examine it carefully. Respectfully submitted to Chairman Chiang.</p>

After the case was investigated and Xu Guanxiang was arrested, he confessed that the deceased's younger brother, Wei Sheng, sought revenge for losing a lawsuit over property disputes with his brother. He conspired with his concubine, Song Xiaomei, at the Jiuhua Hotel in Shanghai, and with Jiang Ahe, who is on the run, to murder his brother, promising a heavy reward after the deed was done.

<h3>District Chief's Scandal Exposed</h3>
<p>Yu Yingsen, the district chief of the 12th District, submitted a report to the county government the day before yesterday, stating that Yuan Yuxiang, a former assistant in the 3rd District of this county, had a bad reputation during his tenure. After leaving office, he became a vagrant and colluded with his mistress, Hua Wenying, to implement fraudulent schemes. He had previously used Hua Wenying's beauty as bait to defraud Bao Songfu, the current district chief of the 16th District, of 70 yuan. Recently, because the 15th was the deadline for receiving funds for the district (Yu referred to himself), and the 16th was the date of the district chief's meeting, he came to the city and stayed at the First Hotel on the road. Unexpectedly, Yuan and Hua also stayed there. On the evening of the 16th, Yuan Yuxiang suddenly ordered the tea room boy, Song Min, to talk to him in his room. When he arrived in the room, Yuan Yuxiang was gone, and only his mistress, Hua Wenying, was inside, falsely accusing him of having an ambiguous affair and demanding a loan of 500 yuan. Min, considering it to be extortion, immediately left. Afterwards, Yuan gathered several unknown people, who came to coerce and intimidate him, demanding at least 50 yuan to settle the matter. This was clearly a fraudulent scheme, and he requested arrest and punishment. After receiving the report, Magistrate Yan immediately sent police to summon Yuan Yuxiang, Hua Wenying, and Yu Yingsen to the case. He opened a court with Yao Fusheng, the director of the interrogation division, to investigate. Yuan and Hua both claimed that District Chief Yu had an affair with Wenying on October 24th. Afterwards, Yu asked Shen Jizhi, the director of the public sports field, to mediate, saying that it was okay for him to pay 50 yuan. When questioned about this, Yu Yingsen confessed that they had been playing a trick. After questioning Shen Jizhi and Chen Mengqi, they all testified that District Chief Yu did offer to pay 50 yuan for a settlement. Magistrate Yan, after verifying the confession, believed that Yuan and Hua's actions were indeed improper, and that Yu Yingsen, as district chief, stayed in the city, neglecting his duties. Moreover, since he had offered 50 yuan for a settlement, it was clear that he was not completely unrelated to Hua. It was also illegal for him to present a false report to the government with accusations of a fraudulent scheme. Therefore, he ordered Yu Yingsen to be dismissed from his post and transferred to the county court for interrogation by Prosecutor Shen. After five hours, the result was an order for Yuan Yuxiang and Hua Wenying to be detained, and Yu Yingsen and the witnesses were ordered to return.</p>

<h3>Labor-Management Dispute Leads to Tragedy</h3>
<p>Recently, the Hu Shunxing sock factory in Si Dunyingfang, Fourth District, was in arrears with wages. The workers' demand for payment was unsuccessful, leading to a shutdown. Yesterday was the date the factory agreed to pay the wages. Many female workers went to the factory gate to wait for payment. Unexpectedly, Hu Qinlai, the factory owner, suddenly refused to pay and, seeing the increasing number of female workers gathering, he closed the factory gate and hired people to pour water on the open space in front of the factory, making it impossible to stand. The female workers protested loudly, and Hu Qinlai led his family and hired ruffians to beat the women severely. As a result, many female workers, including Yang Xiuying, Xi Cuilin, Shen Xiaomei, Xi Cuishi, Ni Lianying, Liu Xiuying, Wang Xiaomei, and Zhu Fengxian, were injured. In addition, the pregnant woman, Qu Wangshi, who was due to give birth soon, was fatally injured and died shortly after. Qu Xishi was also seriously injured and unable to walk. All have been taken to the county government for an inquest.</p>

<h3>Bandits Rob Graveyard Sweepers</h3>
<p>Jiang Shoulun, a businessman from Zhenjiang who lives in Shanghai, came to Zhenjiang with four members of his family the other day. At around 12:00 PM, they took a car from the Jiangbian Automobile Company to the family graveyard in Xiaxindian to sweep the graves. However, when the car reached the vicinity of Qiaojiamen, three bandits wearing gray uniforms and carrying long guns stopped the car. The driver knew they had encountered violence and had no choice but to stop the car. The three bandits boarded the car and searched at will, robbing the Jiang family of five gold rings and more than 20 yuan in cash. Afterwards, the three bandits left. The car continued to take the passengers to Xiaxindian and returned to Zhenjiang at around 3:00 PM, reporting the incident to the Provincial Security Department and requesting the pursuit of the bandits.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Finance's Tax Revenue Booming This Month</h3>
<p>Estimated Total for the Month May Reach 40 Million</p>
<p>A reporter from New News Agency learned from the Shanghai office of the Ministry of Finance that the revenue of Jianghai and other customs offices has been very strong this month.

<h3>Yu Ji Wheel is Likely Lost</h3>
<p>No Response from Shanghai to Telegrams</p>
<p>Jiang Yuan's Passengers Have Not Yet Arrived</p>
<p>丨Dispatching Three Jiang to Transport Food Today丨</p>
<p>The Yu Ji wheel of the Yu Da Company ran aground in the waters off Wenzhou, and the hull was severely damaged. Yesterday, it was reported that a major danger had occurred, with the hull tilting and threatening to sink. The company sent a telegram, but there was no reply. Today, it was decided to send a ship to observe. The follow-up news is divided into the following sections:</p>
<h3>Hull in Danger</h3>
<p>On the night of the 18th, the hull of the Yu Ji wheel tilted to one side due to the flooding of the first two compartments, uneven weight distribution, and wind and waves. Fortunately, the passengers were transferred to a nearby navy ship that night. On the 19th, the Shanghai company sent several telegrams to inquire, but according to the responsible personnel of the company, there was no reply. The company was quite anxious. Yesterday afternoon, news reached this port that the Yu Ji wheel was unable to withstand the impact of the wind and waves and was about to sink. The hull had been severely damaged and was flooded on the morning of the 19th, with no hope of salvage. It is feared that it has already sunk today.</p>
<h3>Calls Not Going Through</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Yu Da Company and Lianbao Insurance Company wanted to understand the extent of the damage to the ship and discuss salvage methods. In the morning, they first sent a telegram to the ship, but there was no reply. In the afternoon, they used wireless radio to call. According to people in the company, they called several times but could not reach the ship. Moreover, the outgoing calls were not accepted, indicating that the ship's electricity was not working and it was unable to send or receive telegrams. The danger to the ship is obvious.</p>
<h3>Jiang Yuan Has Not Arrived</h3>
<p>The Jiang Yuan warship rescued more than 100 passengers and sent them to Shanghai. The first telegram stated that they could arrive in Shanghai on the night of the 19th, or at the latest on the morning of the 20th. After all, Shanghai is only a 30-hour sea journey from Sholond Island, where the accident occurred. If a warship is traveling, it can be faster. Now it is overdue and has not arrived. When asked about the company, they also said they did not know and had no definite news. It may have been delayed due to the danger to the Yu Ji.</p>
<h3>Passengers Fleeing</h3>
<p>The passengers on this trip of Yu Ji who came to Shanghai were all fleeing from the war in Fuzhou. Therefore, among the one hundred and dozens of people, there were many who carried a lot of luggage, and many were families traveling together, with many women, children, elderly, and weak. Now, unfortunately, they encountered danger on the ship. They suffered material losses and mental pain as a result of avoiding the war. It is a great misfortune.</p>
<h3>Cargo Losses</h3>
<p>The hull is covered by a large amount of marine insurance, so Yu Da Company may not suffer significant losses. The cargo inside the ship included 4,000 buckets of oranges and more than 6,000 buckets of olives. Although the Hakka insurance company is said to have only insured 60,000 yuan, accounting for half of the cargo value, olives soaked in seawater will change color and swell, making them unsalable. Therefore, the fruit merchants and insurance companies suffered the greatest losses.</p>
<h3>Land Value Tax Collection Begins in Shanghai's West and Zhabei Districts Today</h3>
<p>Huazhong and Other Districts Must Wait for Continued Assessment</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the land value taxes in the southern Shanghai and Zhabei areas of the city have been assessed by the valuation committee and are scheduled to begin collection today. The remaining Huazhong and other districts will continue to be assessed. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Collection Begins Today</h3>
<p>The provisional land value tax in districts one through eight in southern Shanghai and districts one and two in Zhabei has been assessed by the valuation committee hired by the Finance and Land Bureaus. The highest land value in the city is 21,000 yuan, and the lowest is 800 yuan. The Finance Bureau has decided to start collecting taxes today. The valuation committee is still continuing to assess land values in the other areas, including Huazhong, Yinxin Special District, Pu Song, Zhenru, Wusong, Longhua, Yangsi, Yangjing, Caojing, Yinhang, Luhang, Gaohang, and Jiangwan.</p>
<h3>Collection Method</h3>
<p>The collection procedures will be handled by the North Shanghai Tax Collection Office of the Finance Bureau for the Zhabei area, and by the South Shanghai Tax Collection Office for the southern Shanghai area. All landowners within the collection area must, within two months from the start of collection, hold their land ownership certificate and pay the tax to the collection office in accordance with the regulations. Those who have not completed the land survey and clearance and have not exchanged for new certificates will not be accepted. The tax rate is 0.6% of the assessed land value, payable in two installments, upper and lower halves of the year. Each installment is 0.3%. If the land value is under appeal, the tax will be collected according to the assessed value determined by the public valuation. If the public ruling decides that the amount is insufficient, the deficiency must be paid up; if there is a surplus, it will be used for the next installment.</p>
<h3>Joint Announcement</h3>
<p>In addition to the joint announcement by the Finance and Land Bureaus regarding the collection of the provisional land value tax, a tax notice will be sent to taxpayers, detailing the location of the taxpayer's land, land area, assessed land value per mu, the amount of tax payable for this installment, the tax deadline, the tax collection agency, address, and the penalties for overdue taxes. The notice was sent out last week. If taxpayers have not received the notice due to an unknown address or relocation, they must immediately report it to the tax collection agency.</p>
<h3>Handling Overdue Taxes</h3>
<p>If the tax is not paid within two months from the start of collection, it will be considered overdue and will be pursued. In addition to the amount owed, an additional 5% annual interest will be levied from the day after the tax deadline. If the tax is not paid for three years, the collection agency may, with the approval of the municipal government, auction the land and any fixed assets on it to offset the overdue tax, and the surplus will be returned to the original tax debtor.</p>
<h3>Dispatching Ship to Transport Food</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Yu Da Company and Lianbao Company agreed that there were still some aspects of the Yu Ji's situation that were not yet clear, and decided to send a ship to investigate. After discussions with Yu Da, they consulted with Daxing Company and chartered the Three Jiang ship to set sail from Shanghai to Wenzhou Ocean this afternoon to inspect the current situation of Yu Ji and whether it can be salvaged. The company has allocated food for the crew on board, which will be delivered by Mr. Xu, the owner of the Three Jiang ship, to provide assistance. According to people in the company, in the event that the crew cannot stay on the Yu Ji ship, the navy ship Chu Guan is nearby and they can move to the ship. There is little hope for the rescue of Yu Ji. Also, Wanglai Company in this port has insured the cargo for several tens of thousands of yuan and has decided to wait until the Three Jiang ship arrives at the site to inspect before jointly discussing salvage methods.</p>
<h3>New Culture Bookstore's Defense Letter and the Chamber of Commerce's Stern Rebuttal</h3>
<p>Confirmed by Both Public Associations</p>
<p>Sufficient to Show Utmost Impartiality</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce published information about the New Culture Bookstore purchasing inferior paper and printing/selling books like "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio," it has greatly attracted social attention. Yesterday, the Chamber received a defense letter from the bookstore and issued a stern rebuttal.</p>
<p>The direct reply stated: On the 19th of this month, we received your letter requesting the paper industry association to provide substantial evidence regarding the purchase of over ten thousand reams of paper. We are fully aware.</p>
<p>The fact that your bookstore uses Japanese paper was already proven by the paper industry association through the "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio" sold by your bookstore. Although the accusation was initiated by the paper industry association, the assessment was actually conducted by the book industry association. The book industry association's primary duty is to protect the interests of its members. Since the association has confirmed that it is indeed Japanese paper, it sufficiently demonstrates their utmost impartiality.</p>
<p>Regarding the bookstore's inspection of the paper industry, it is claimed to be "a father defending his son," which is an inappropriate statement. As for the book industry's assessment, it is dismissed as "jealousy among peers." Thus, the reports from both associations are considered untrustworthy. While the bookstore may protect itself, the Chamber cannot share the same view.</p>
<p>It is important to understand that the term "jealousy among peers" is applicable between bookstores. However, the position of a public association transcends individual interests, encompassing all members from A to Z. The association maintains a detached and objective stance. Therefore, the Chamber believes that the book industry association's assessment cannot be overturned by the bookstore.</p>
<p>Respectfully submitted to the New Culture Bookstore.</p>
<h3>Italian Minister Pays a Visit to Mayor Wu Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Petitioning the Ministry of Finance in the Capital Today</h3>
<p>Requesting Exemption from Import Tax on Previously Ordered Goods</p>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance announced the imposition of import taxes on foreign rice, wheat, and flour starting from the 16th of this month, the flour manufacturers in various regions faced significant losses due to the required import tax on previously ordered foreign wheat and flour. The flour manufacturers in Shanghai and representatives from various regions jointly held an emergency meeting to discuss countermeasures. They decided to request the Ministry of Finance to order customs to exempt the tax.</p>
<p>Nine representatives were selected to go to the capital to petition the Ministry of Finance's Taxation Department and various administrative agencies. The results of the petition to the Customs Administration the day before yesterday were satisfactory.</p>
<p>The representatives, including Gu Xin Yi, Sun Zhong Li, Wang Yao Chen, Shi Fu Hou, Li Zhuang Tao, Sun Bin Nan, Bu Xiao Qing, Wang Shi Xin, and Gu Yu Xun, are taking the Shanghai-Nanjing express train to the capital today.

<h3>Three Bureaus Survey the Disaster Situation in Various Rural Areas</h3>
<p>Repeatedly Sent Personnel to Complete the Survey</p>
<p>Immediately Submitted to the Municipal Government for Discretionary Reduction of Land Tax</p>
<p>Between this year's summer and autumn, both a hurricane and a tidal surge caused severe disasters in various rural areas, especially along the coast. The rural areas repeatedly requested the municipal authorities to provide urgent relief. The Municipal Government immediately ordered the Social, Land, and Finance Bureaus to survey the disaster situation and provide discretionary land tax reductions.</p>
<p>It is understood that the three bureaus have repeatedly sent personnel to conduct surveys and have now completed their work. They will immediately submit a report to the Municipal Government for review and approval. The following is a record of the three bureaus' survey of agricultural crop losses in various districts during the autumn disaster:</p>
<p>District　Description of Disaster　Percentage of Loss</p>
<p>Wusong　Approximately twenty breaches in the dam along the Yunzaobang River　54</p>

<h3>The Navy's Jungan Transport Ship Purchased by Sanbei as a Merchant Vessel</h3>
<p>The Price is Over 300,000</p>
<p>In recent years, the Navy has built new ships and has leased or sold its older transport ships to various shipping companies for use as merchant vessels. In the spring of this year, the Puan, the Navy's largest tonnage ship, was leased to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and converted into a cruise ship. Now, the Jungan ship has also been priced at over 300,000 and sold to the Sanbei Shipping Company.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, Mr. Yu Qiaqing, the manager of Sanbei, visited Gaochang Temple for inspection and contacted naval authorities. The Jungan transport ship was originally built in Germany, with a load capacity of 4,000 tons, a horsepower of 1,164, and a speed of 11 knots. After being renovated by the shipyard, it will indeed be a good merchant vessel.</p>
<h3>The Public Concession's Telephone Price Increase Plan Temporarily Withdrawn</h3>
<p>The Telephone Company's Existing USD Debt</p>
<p>Will be Converted into a Silver Loan with the Assistance of the Municipal Council</p>
<p>At the Municipal Council meeting on the 13th of this month, the Chief Financial Officer reported that the telephone company's request for an immediate price increase was mainly due to the fact that a large portion of its investment was raised in US dollars, and the exchange rate calculated according to the agreement was attributed to the company. Therefore, the company planned to increase prices by 41% in 1935 to maintain operations.</p>
<p>After discussions between the Chief Financial Officer and the company, the company was advised to convert its capital entirely into silver to avoid exchange rate risks for the benefit of users. However, the company had also considered raising silver loans to repay its USD debt, but had not been able to do so. Therefore, the Chief Financial Officer suggested that the Municipal Council assist the company in completing this task, subject to the following conditions: (1) the application for an immediate price increase must be withdrawn; (2) the price increase in 1935 must not exceed 25%; (3) there must be no further price increases in the two-year period from 1935 to April 1937.</p>
<p>The required silver loan is approximately 6 million taels. Since the Chief Financial Officer has funds available for investment at the end of this year, it is proposed to lend 4 million taels to the company at an interest rate of 6.25%. The remaining amount can be raised locally. The Council's loan will be for a term ending at the end of 1937, but the Council can recall 500,000 to 1 million taels at any time with six months' notice, starting in 1934. This method complies with the Council's regulations and is very beneficial for general users. The public can be assured that the price increase in 1935 will be at most one-quarter, and in fact, it may not be that much.</p>
<p>After discussions, the Council has decided to proceed as proposed by the Chief Financial Officer. The company is currently developing a plan on how to ensure that large and small users share the price increase equally. This issue will be further studied in the future.</p>
<h3>The Bankers Association Sent a Letter to Members Yesterday, Setting a Deadline to Report Silver Bullion Amounts</h3>
<p>The Total Silver Bullion in the City is Approximately 130 Million Taels</p>
<p>A Shanghai Times reporter reports from this city that the Ministry of Finance is actively promoting the abolition of the tael and the adoption of the yuan in order to unify the currency system. Recently, the Ministry has ordered the Central Bank to send a letter to the banking industry, setting a deadline of one month for reporting all silver taels stored in the city to the Ministry of Finance. The Central Bank is authorized to exchange silver taels for silver dollars at a prescribed conversion rate (7.15). If the Central Mint's minting capacity is insufficient for full exchange, the exchange may be done on a monthly basis.</p>
<p>The amount of silver bullion currently stored in this city is a matter of concern to all sectors. The Shanghai Times reporter made inquiries from various sources and learned that the Bankers Association has, in accordance with the Ministry of Finance's deadline, forwarded a detailed report to its members. The Bankers Association's original letter and the survey of stored silver are recorded separately below.</p>
<h3>Letter from the Bankers Association</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the Bankers Association, sent a letter to more than 30 member banks, including the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Central Trust of China, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, and Ningbo Commercial Bank. The letter stated:</p>
<p>"Gentlemen, in accordance with the Central Bank's letter and the Ministry of Finance's repeated urging, for the sake of completing the abolition of the tael, this bank is specially ordered to forward to Chinese and foreign banking institutions a request to report the amount of silver bullion previously circulated on the market that is currently stored. This report must be submitted to this bank within one month for compilation and transmission to the Ministry of Finance for registration. After verification by officials dispatched by the Ministry, the banks will be allowed to exchange the silver bullion for silver coins at a rate of 7.15 per month. We should comply accordingly. In addition to sending separate letters, we are enclosing a copy of the Ministry of Finance's letter for your reference. Please forward it to your member banks for compliance and promptly respond within one month with the amount of silver bullion stored in your banks for compilation and transmission to the Ministry of Finance. We hope for your cooperation. Chairman Lin Kanghou."</p>
<h3>Investigation of Stored Silver Bullion</h3>
<p>Silver bullion was a silver ingot of unequal size during the old days. Their quality also varied. Without a professional appraisal, it was difficult to distinguish between good and bad. Since the import of Mexican silver into the interior, society found it convenient, and China also minted a lot. In fact, silver bullion had stopped circulating. However, the banking industry still widely used it as reserves.</p>
<p>This has become a habit and is difficult to abolish immediately. Bills and notes are all denominated in silver taels. Therefore, society had two units: silver taels and silver dollars. The coming and going of keeping accounts and currency conversions was very cumbersome. The Ministry of Finance will thoroughly abolish the unit of silver tael, otherwise it is impossible to recast all these existing silver taels into silver coins. However, it will take a great quantity to do so, hence, it needs to have detailed investigation, so that the statistics may come forth. Currently the number of silver bullions held by various banks and pawnshops, according to Chairman Lin Kanghou of the Bank Association, the total amount of silver bullions in circulation in the city is about 130 million taels.</p>
<h3>Gansu Provincial Government Sends Telegram Welcoming Shanghai Factories to Promote Domestic Goods</h3>
<p>Travel Expenses Along the Way Will Be Appropriately Subsidized</p>
<p>Various Manufacturers Are Currently Holding Meetings to Discuss</p>
<p>They Can Travel Next Spring</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu Shaoliang, Chairman of the Gansu Provincial Government, has recently expressed regret that the poor transportation in the Northwest has hindered the development of industries in the region. Therefore, Mr. Zhu has developed a plan to promote industrial development and has telegraphed his representative in Beijing, stating that he first intends to promote domestic goods.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Mr. Zhu telegraphed that he welcomes Shanghai domestic goods manufacturers to jointly organize a domestic goods mobile sales group and immediately send personnel to the Northwest, including Gansu Province. Mr. Zhu has also jointly invited Ningxia, Qinghai, and Shaanxi provinces to host and welcome the group. He has ordered the construction department to immediately renovate an existing City God Temple in Gansu Province for use as a domestic goods market.</p>
<p>The provincial government will appropriately subsidize the travel expenses and living expenses of the domestic goods sales personnel along the way. It is reported that Shanghai domestic goods manufacturers have been holding meetings to discuss this matter, and they are expected to travel next spring. They have already notified various factories to prepare to transport practical domestic goods to the Northwest. It is also reported that Mr. Zhu will request the government to grant tax exemptions to the domestic goods factories that travel to the Northwest as an incentive, and he will order the military and police along the way to provide adequate protection.</p>
<h3>British Merchant Ship Sinks Ningbo Merchant Ship</h3>
<p>Crew Member Xia Yilin Drowned</p>
<p>The Ningbo fishing boat Ni Shunmao, loaded with sand and mud, came to Shanghai. On the 18th of this month, at approximately 5:00 AM, after unloading the sand and mud at Yangshupu, it sailed towards Ningbo. At 5:15 AM, while sailing on the Zhanghuabang River, it was struck by the British merchant ship G. Beniller, owned by Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., which was sailing head-on without sounding its horn. Unable to avoid the collision, the Ningbo ship was hit on the beam, and the foremast broke immediately. Crew member Xia Yilin was knocked into the water by the broken mast.</p>
<p>The British ship, after hitting the Ni ship and seeing the crew member fall into the water, did not provide assistance but continued sailing towards Shanghai. Fortunately, the Zhanghuabang Customs patrol boat noticed the incident and immediately went to rescue the Ni ship, which did not sink. However, crew member Xia Yilin was severely injured and died shortly after being rescued.</p>
<p>It is reported that boatswain He Guisheng has sent a crew member, Xiao Man, back to his hometown to report to the boat owner, Ni Mingde, in preparation for filing a claim with the shipping company.</p>
<h3>All Workers at the Two Railways' Wusong Machine Factory Go on Strike</h3>
<p>Demanding the Dismissal and Investigation of General Affairs Director Mo Heng</p>
<p>Various Party Branches and Sub-Offices Rise Up in Support</p>
<p>The Management Bureau Holds Meetings for Several Days and Sends Personnel to Inspect the Factory</p>
<p>Since Huang Boqiao became the director of the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways, he transferred Mo Heng, the former section chief of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Works, to serve as the director of general affairs. Conflicts have arisen frequently, especially the rejection of the contracting system by the loading and unloading workers at Maigen Road and the salary increase case in 1933.</p>
<p>The employees of the two railways have long been dissatisfied with Mo Heng's improper actions, his abuse of power, his slander of the Party and the country, and his disruption of the labor movement. They have endured these actions due to the national crisis. This time, Mo Heng was also appointed as the director of the materials department. He suddenly transferred Cao Wenkui (an clerk in the Wusong Materials Factory), the executive secretary of the Wusong Machine Factory branch of the two railways' labor union, to Ningbo.</p>
<p>Mo Heng stated to Mr. Cao that all those who participate in party affairs and the labor movement are dangerous elements, so he was transferring him to protect him. This has caused great dissatisfaction among the employees of the two railways, especially at the Wusong Machine Factory. The workers at the factory have now gone on strike, vowing to drive out Mo Heng.</p>
<p>They have issued a declaration to drive out Mo Heng, posted slogans throughout the stations, and submitted reports to the Central Executive Committee, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Railways, the party branches of the two railways, the management bureau of the two railways, and the labor union of the two railways, requesting the dismissal and investigation of Mo Heng. They have also sent telegrams to various parties for assistance. The information obtained is recorded below:</p>
<h3>Declaration to Drive Out Mo Heng</h3>
<p>Declaration by all workers of the Wusong Machine Factory of the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways to drive out Mo Heng, Director of General Affairs and Director of Materials Department.</p>
<p>Fellow workers of the two railways, compatriots of the whole country! We know that the personnel serving in the railway public utility have important positions and receive good treatment. We can only strive to increase productivity and improve operations in order to live up to the country's desire for construction and maintain the stability of our personal lives. We also know that the only way out for the Republic of China is to implement the Three Principles of the People. Anyone who betrays the Chinese Kuomintang and hinders the implementation of the Three Principles of the People is undoubtedly a counter-revolutionary and must be sanctioned.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, since Mo Heng became the Director of General Affairs of the two railways, he has abused his power, acted perversely, deceived workers, and provoked discord in an attempt to achieve his own goals through despicable means. Recently, he also became the Director of the Materials Department, further increasing his power and threatening everyone. In order to protect the Party and the country, the labor union, railway property, and the interests of workers, we vow to drive out Mo Heng, the Director of General Affairs and Director of the Materials Department, who betrays the Party, pursues private interests, sabotages the labor movement, and endangers railway property.</p>
<p>The charges against him are briefly stated as follows, for the reference of all workers of the two railways and compatriots of the whole country:</p>
<p>(1) Pursuing private interests and engaging in corruption: The state-owned railways are the lifeline of the country. The two railways, which connect the capital, are even more important. All employees, especially senior officials, should economize on public funds and serve faithfully. However, Mo Heng is blinded by greed. He privately exchanges material purchase contracts with merchants and buys inferior goods at high prices. Fearing that his black deeds would be exposed, he transferred Zhang Zhiyun, the chief of the accounting section of the materials factory. The facts are clear and can be verified. It is inconceivable that such a crazy person would exist in an agency under a clean government, using public office for private gain and engaging in corruption. If this plague is not eliminated, the railway will be difficult to manage. We will never allow him to remain in a high position in the two railways to mislead the country and harm the workers.</p>
<p>(2) Betraying the Party and the country: Mo Heng is a civil servant under the rule of the National Government, but he harbors deep hatred for the Chinese Kuomintang. He always treats the Party as the most taboo topic and openly propagates to the employees of the two railways. If we are not forgetful, we should remember his profound slanders of party rule at Jiaxing Zhakou and Ningbo. Recently, he has intensified his actions and regards those who participate in party affairs and the labor movement as dangerous elements. His thoughts, words, and actions are all counter-revolutionary. Revolutionaries and counter-revolutionaries cannot coexist. It is the duty of loyal comrades to overthrow counter-revolutionaries.</p>
<p>(3) Sabotaging the labor movement: Supporting labor is a consistent policy of the Kuomintang. Strengthening the workers' organization is an urgent need for the workers. The labor union of the two railways has existed for several years, but Mo Heng has always refused to recognize the union. He refuses to accept any reports submitted by employees in the name of the labor union, or orders them to talk in a personal capacity. Recently, he suddenly transferred Cao Wenkui, an employee of the Wusong Materials Factory, to Ningbo. This is originally a routine matter of the railway administration, but the motive for his transfer is that Mr. Cao is currently the executive secretary of the Wusong Machine Factory branch and is very active in party affairs. In order to restrict the development of party affairs and the labor movement, Mo Heng transferred Mr. Cao and told him that participating in party affairs and the labor movement are dangerous actions. It can be seen that his sabotage of the labor movement is premeditated and has been going on for more than a day.</p>
<p>His crimes are certainly not limited to these, but these points are enough to illustrate the rest. For the sake of loving the Party, the country, the railway, and the workers, we will not stop until we achieve the goal of driving out Mo Heng. We want to retain Comrade Cao Wenkui to continue to be responsible for the Wusong Machine Factory branch. But we absolutely guarantee to abide by order and will never go beyond the rules. We hope that those who sympathize with us will provide assistance. This is our declaration.</p>
<h3>Strike Situation</h3>
<p>After the above facts occurred, all the workers of the Wusong Machine Factory and the Materials Factory immediately requested the Party branch and the labor union of the two railways to take action regarding the retention of Comrade Cao Wenkui and the absurdity of Director Mo's remarks. The Party branch dispatched members Chen Chengshi, Zou Kexin, and Li Dasan, and the labor union dispatched directors Min Luo Bing and Chen Bohua to negotiate with the railway bureau, but to no avail. Therefore, on the 19th, the workers of the two factories went on strike, vowing to drive out Mo Heng and carry out their original intention. The Party branch and the labor union are now doing their best to persuade and mediate in an attempt to prevent the dispute from escalating.</p>
<h3>Support from All Sides</h3>
<p>After receiving the telegram and declaration from the Wusong Machine Factory, the Party branches at all levels and the sub-offices and direct branches of the labor union of the two railways, based on past experiences and current events, for the sake of loving the Party, the country, the railway, and the workers, supporting the labor union, and protecting the interests of the workers, have risen up in support. For example, the first district party branch, the first, second, fourth, fifth, and sixth sub-branches of the first district, and the Shanghai Machine Factory sub-office have all issued declarations and telegrams separately, and have requested the Party branch of the two railways to forward them to the central government, demanding the dismissal and investigation of Mo Heng in order to appease the public.</p>
<h3>Bureau Meeting</h3>
<p>After learning that all the workers of the Wusong Machine Factory and the Materials Factory were on strike, the management bureau of the two railways immediately convened a meeting of the persons in charge of the general affairs, mechanical affairs, and materials departments to discuss countermeasures. On the previous two days, they sent Deputy Director of General Affairs Yuan Boyang, Director of Mechanical Affairs Wang Bi, Deputy Director of Mechanical Affairs and Director of the Chemical Experiment Institute Lu Baogang, and Liu Junming, a staff member of the Personnel Section, to Wusong to persuade the workers to resume work and wait for a solution. However, the workers were unanimously determined and unmoved.</p>
<h3>Traffic Unimpeded</h3>
<p>The New Voice News Agency reported that since the workers of the Wusong Machine Factory went on strike, all work at the factory has completely stopped. However, the employees of the two railways, as well as the workers of the Shanghai Machine Factory, Zhakou Machine Factory, and Baisha Machine Factory, are working as usual. Therefore, passenger and freight trains on the two railways are still running as usual without any impact. As for the repair of vehicles, the railway bureau has sent personnel to transport them to the Zhakou Machine Factory for repair. However, the repair of machinery will be temporarily handled by the Shanghai Machine Factory.</p>
<h3>Mo Heng Resigns</h3>
<p>The railway bureau believes that the transfer of Cao Wenkui, an employee of the Wusong Materials Factory, is within the administrative authority of the railway bureau and will continue to persuade the workers. As for Mo Heng, the director of general affairs and director of the materials department, it is reported that he has submitted a request to the director yesterday to send personnel to thoroughly investigate the truth in order to uncover the truth, and has also submitted his resignation. Directors Huang Boqiao and Wu Shaozeng believe that Mo Heng's transfer of personnel was carried out under orders and should be sincerely retained.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Telegram to the Executive Yuan Urging Thorough Investigation of the Qinlian Soil Sugar Penalty Case</h3>
<p>Reviving National Sugar Requires Protecting Existing Industries</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday telegraphed the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry (titles omitted): "On the 18th of this month, we received a letter from the Hepu County Chamber of Commerce of Guangdong Province stating: 'It is noted in the letter from the Qinlian Sugar Industry Guangyi Hall that we received letters from our fellow traders Heli, Henghe, Longguang, Changhe, and Heyi stating that from July to September of this year, these traders shipped native white sugar from Beihai to Shanghai five times. Each time, they reported to the Beihai Customs for inspection, confirming that it was pure native sugar. They paid the transit tax according to regulations and were then released. Unexpectedly, when the original cargo arrived in Shanghai, it was completely detained by the Jianghai Customs Tax Office, which claimed that it was mixed with 10% to 20% foreign sugar. A total of 1,560 yuan was fined, and 1,957 yuan was added to the tax. The method used to distinguish between native sugar and foreign sugar was without any standard, and many mistakes were made. The traders have already jointly submitted a petition and telegram to protest, but more than a month has passed, and the matter has not been resolved. The traders have suffered a significant loss innocently, forcing them to temporarily suspend business and await relief. A detailed list of the fined firms is specially provided for your review. We earnestly request that you forward the letter to the Beihai Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Qinlian County Chambers of Commerce, who will report the situation to the Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance, instructing the Jianghai Customs Tax Office to refund the fines in full to demonstrate fairness.' We have investigated that Beihai is an important port for the export of native sugar in South China. The Beihai Customs is close to the sugar-producing area and has a clear understanding of the composition of native sugar and its differences from foreign sugar. Therefore, our fellow traders have repeatedly reported the attached native sugar, which was inspected and released without any misunderstanding or difficulty. Now, the original cargo has been shipped directly to Shanghai, and the Jianghai Customs claims that it is mixed with foreign sugar and imposes a huge fine, which is obviously an abuse of power and a destruction of local products. If this is not stopped according to law, how can farmers and businessmen live in peace? We have specially recorded the case and presented it to you, earnestly requesting that you forward the letter according to the situation, so as to alleviate the difficulties of the merchants." The council approved this. Since the Jianghai Customs detained and fined native sugar, sugar merchants have ceased shipping, resulting in considerable losses. More than ten counties of farmers and workers who rely on the sugar industry for their livelihoods are at risk of bankruptcy and unemployment. Livelihoods and public security are greatly affected. Based on the aforementioned letter, and considering that the matter concerns the livelihoods of farmers and merchants in more than ten counties, we have specially joined with the Hepu County Chamber of Commerce to convene a public meeting of fellow traders, guilds, and all sugar merchants to discuss relief measures. Four resolutions were jointly agreed upon: (1) Request the Ministry of Finance to correct the erroneous methods of Jianghai Customs for distinguishing between native sugar and foreign sugar. (2) Request the Ministry of Finance to order Jianghai Customs to release the native sugar of Beihai sugar merchants and refund all previous fines and tax supplements. (3) Request the Executive Yuan to order the Ministry of Finance to instruct all customs offices nationwide to ensure the safety of native sugar imports and exports and not to deliberately create difficulties. (4) Request the central government to issue a clear order to exempt native sugar from export and transit taxes and to establish export incentive measures for native sugar. All were unanimously approved. In addition to telegrams and separate reports, we have specially recorded the case and jointly presented it to your association, and have sent representative Pang Songhui to explain everything in person. Please provide practical assistance so that this case can be resolved as soon as possible, which would not only be fortunate for the Qinlian sugar merchants but also for the entire national commerce." It was also reported that the native sugar from Qiong was transferred and exported, and the Qionghai Customs and Jianghai Customs referred to it as adulterated foreign sugar and detained it for punishment, involving as many as eight companies. The reading time was as long as seven months, and the association and the sugar merchants' representative Xing Juefei separately presented it to the hospital and the ministry, requesting arbitration and snow removal, but it has not been resolved so far. According to the previous report, Qinlian native sugar was transferred to Shanghai, and there was a continuous fine from the Shanghai Customs, which is even more frightening. The value of foreign sugar is higher than that of native sugar, and there is no reason to mix it with native sugar for sale, and foreign sugar transit is not required to pay taxes according to regulations, and there is no mixing with native sugar, which increases the amount of native sugar and voluntarily pays one more transit tax. Qiong sugar transit has been repeatedly confiscated and punished, and merchants operate safely, and there is no repeated sacrifice of blood capital, willing to risk the law. All of these situations have been repeatedly submitted to the hospital and the ministry for hosting and snow removal, but to this day, the destruction of customs officials remains the same, and its scope has expanded from Qiongyai to Qinlian, as if all sugar-producing areas in China are places where foreign sugar is smuggled and sold. This kind of arbitrary decision is already frightening. If that is the case, then the customs has already committed a major dereliction of duty. Whether foreign sugar is smuggled and sold is one thing, and whether native sugar is mixed and sold is another. Mixing high-priced foreign sugar with low-priced native sugar not only reduces the value, but also risks huge deductions and fines. Even the most foolish person would not do this. The output of domestic sugar is only counted by Sichuan and Guangdong. Now, Sichuan sugar is hindered from foreign sales due to the heavy taxes in the province, and Guangdong sugar is intentionally destroyed by customs officials, causing sugarcane farmers and sugar merchants there to be discouraged and create opportunities for foreign sugar to sell well, which is especially indignant. I have repeatedly read reports that the Ministry of Industry has a plan to revitalize national sugar, and the articles are well-organized and convincing. I implore you to first protect the existing industries before it can be effective. If Guangdong sugar is hindered everywhere when it is transshipped to various provinces, the gardeners and merchants will stop their business and change their plans, and the foundation of national sugar will be destroyed, and how can it be revitalized? Because of deep worries, the words are not so concise. Please ask the members of the hospital and the ministry to verify, and together with the repeated complaints about the Qiong sugar fines, quickly grant snow removal together, so that sugar merchants who are suppressed by customs officials can still see justice in the government. The eager hope is to comfort the public. Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, kowtow, Xiao.</p>
<h3>Central Government Instructions Arrive in Shanghai on the Issue of Road Construction Beyond Boundaries, Negotiations to Continue Immediately</h3>
<p>The Bureau of Public Works Submits Two New Points Under Request for Instructions</p>
<p>Once Police Authority is Resolved, the Rest Can Be Solved Easily</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Government took back the case of road construction beyond boundaries, there has been good progress after the two sides re-negotiated. However, the Bureau of Public Works has raised two new points: First, the taxes in the area beyond boundaries should be based on historical customs, and there should be no increase or decrease after the recovery. Second, all branch roads between the two main roads will still be the responsibility of the Bureau of Public Works. After the Bureau of Public Works put forward these two points, the municipal government asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for comments by telegram, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs submitted it to the Executive Yuan for approval. The Executive Yuan discussed it at the meeting on the 19th, and most of them have passed. The instructions can be sent to Shanghai within a few days. A reporter from the New Voice Agency learned from relevant parties yesterday that the case is not far from being resolved. The Japanese side's request for a police chief was not only strongly rejected by our country due to issues of sovereignty, but also opposed by the British and American authorities. Therefore, this point is no longer a problem. Otherwise, negotiations cannot continue. As for the two new points raised by the Bureau of Public Works, because they also concern administrative sovereignty, the municipal government has telegraphed to the central government for instructions. The central government will definitely send instructions to Shanghai. However, once the police authority is resolved, all other problems can be solved easily and will not cause further obstacles. It is also heard that the municipal government will continue to negotiate with the Bureau of Public Works as soon as the instructions from the Executive Yuan arrive in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>The Postal Affairs Associations Continue to Insist on the Prosecution of Huang's Case</h3>
<p>The Story of Reconciliation is Groundless</p>
<p>And Telegraphed to the Universal Postal Union to Express Opposition</p>
<p>The Postal Affairs Associations recently saw in the newspaper that Huang Naishu, Director General of the Directorate General of Posts, has gone abroad to attend the Universal Postal Congress, which is very angry. The two associations have always insisted on their claim that Huang usually goes against the trend, engages in corruption, has a despicable character, and is shameless. This trip abroad is merely imitating the old trick of Liu Shufan in order to seize huge sums of money and fill his own pockets. In fact, it is of no benefit to the postal service. However, recently it was reported that the postal workers have completely reconciled with Huang's departure abroad, which is completely unfounded and obviously a cover-up by villains. The two associations have always opposed Huang's departure abroad, and recently postal workers across the country have responded one after another, willing to take joint action to punish Huang and eliminate the thief of the postal service. Although the Ministry of Communications is temporarily blinded by him, postal workers across the country have never been in agreement with him. It is also heard that the two associations plan to telegraph to the Universal Postal Congress to express the opposition of postal workers across the country to Huang's representation of China's postal service at the meeting because Huang's character is despicable and insignificant and cannot represent China's postal service.</p>
<h3>Qingyun Warship Escapes and Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Escaped from Majiang and Xiaojiang</p>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, the naval Qingyun surveying vessel was previously hammering and measuring in Majiang. The Min Incident suddenly occurred, and the Changmen Fortress was taken over by the 19th Route Army, and it was impossible to escape for a while. At the same time, there were also two surveying vessels, Jingxing and Haigou, detained by Min. Now the Qingyun surveying vessel has escaped and arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, led by Captain Zheng Tici, and is berthed at Gaochangmiao Port. In the afternoon, the reporter met with the personnel of the vessel, who said that they did not know anything about the Min Incident. When the Changmen Fortress was captured, the ship sailed to the upper reaches of Majiang. Jingxing and Haigou were in Mawei, so they were intercepted by the 19th Route Army, and all personnel were imprisoned. After the ship sailed to the upper reaches, it was learned that although the Changmen Fortress was taken over, it was difficult to pass through. However, there was still a Xiaojiang that could bypass the fortress and enter the sea. It was then confirmed that the Min side had not sent troops to guard it. Therefore, it took a detour through the port and escaped to Shanghai. There was no loss of personnel or any surveying equipment, which was really fortunate. Now Captain Zheng Tici has arrived in Shanghai and reported to Chen Tongling (Jiliang). He has already taken a car to Beijing last night.</p>
<h3>Jin Xi's Family Representatives Petitioned the Municipal Government Again Yesterday</h3>
<p>According to the Eurasia News Agency, Jin Xi, who has been naturalized and enrolled in school, was illegally arrested by the Japanese consulate in the French Concession. Yesterday afternoon, around 4 p.m., Jin Xi's family representatives, Chen Yang and others, stated that Jin has been arrested and detained for 29 days. According to Japanese law, the consulate cannot detain a prisoner for more than this number of days. If he is not released on time, he will be sent back to the country for processing. Therefore, they feel that Jin's future is extremely dangerous, and Jin's family is in a miserable and impoverished situation. Therefore, they met with Secretary Guo on behalf of the secretary. After Chen and Zhou expressed their intentions, Secretary Guo replied that the municipal government has already sent personnel to negotiate with the Japanese consul orally and formally protested in writing to demand his return based on reports from all parties and the request of Jin's family. Now the Japanese consul has replied, but the wording is extremely evasive, saying that the country has long had a clear order that Koreans are not allowed to transfer to any nationality, so they cannot recognize Jin's naturalization in your country. As for the French consulate, it has also requested the Japanese consul to return him according to law based on the concession agreement. Later, Chen, the family representative of Jin, asked him to forward to Mayor Wu the reasons for refuting the Japanese consul, saying that regarding the Japanese refusal to allow Koreans to transfer to other countries, it can be based on Jin Xi and his father Yongduo being arrested by the Japanese consul on November 30 last year. Fortunately, various groups negotiated with the Japanese consul to release him because Jin had been naturalized in China, which can prove that naturalization is not a problem. Now the municipal government is collecting various reasons to discuss the issue of refuting, and will submit a second protest to the Japanese consul within a few days.</p>
<h3>Civil Servant Disciplinary Meeting Resolves That Xi Dejiong Did Not Falsify Engineering Reports</h3>
<p>The General Situation Table of the River Embankment was Temporarily Made for Reference</p>
<p>The Qikou Embankment and Other Works Were Not Yet Accepted During the Flood</p>
<p>The Supervisory Yuan previously impeached Xi Dejiong, director of the Engineering Office of the National Economic Committee, for falsifying engineering reports and wasting huge sums of money. It decided to send him to the Central Civil Servant Disciplinary Committee for disciplinary action. The facts on which the Supervisory Yuan based its decision were the insufficient height of the Qikou Embankment and the dangerous situation of the Mahua Embankment. Xi was the director of the Engineering Office of the Flood Relief Committee after the flood in the 20th year of the Republic of China and was responsible for the construction of the main embankments of the Jianghuai Han Canal. After the Flood Relief Committee ended, the Engineering Office of the Economic Committee took over, and he was always in charge of the embankment work. He could not shirk his responsibility. After being transferred to the Central Civil Servant Disciplinary Committee, the committee investigated and found that the General Situation Table of the River Embankment, on which the supervisory committee members based their decision, was made by the Engineering Office this summer at the request of the Yangtze River Flood Prevention Association for reference. It was hastily made and incomplete and cannot be used as a formal basis. It decided to notify the Engineering Office of the Economic Committee that the Qikou Embankment and other places were contracted by the Chinese and Foreign Volunteer Relief Association and were only reported to be completed in March of this year and have not yet been accepted. It is not a formal report and cannot be considered as falsifying engineering reports and held responsible. As for the dangerous situation of the Mahua Embankment, the Jianghuai embankments under its management have a total length of more than 9,000 li. Due to weather, human affairs, economy, wind and rain erosion, tidal surge and other factors, this smallest part has sunk due to pressure, which is not intentional falsification.</p>
<h3>The Yellow Disaster Relief Association Adds 100,000 Sets of Cotton Clothes</h3>
<p>40,000 Sets for Hebei, 30,000 Sets for Henan, and 30,000 Sets for Shandong</p>
<p>The Distribution of 30,000 Yuan of Relief Grain to Various Counties in Henan is Resolved</p>
<p>The Disaster Relief Group of the Yellow River Flood Relief Committee added 100,000 sets of cotton clothes for women and children. 10,000 sets were contracted by the Shandong Houde Poor People's Factory. The remaining 90,000 sets were solicited for quotations by the Procurement and Transportation Group in Shanghai, and the three companies with the lowest prices were contracted. 13 pounds of blue cloth were used for the surface, 11 pounds of white cloth for the lining, and 2.5 liang of top white cotton for each set. The price for each set of women's clothing is 1.9002 yuan, and the price for each set of children's clothing is 1.1558 yuan. It is heard that they can be made ready soon and shipped out in a few days. It is estimated that there will be 40,000 sets for Hebei, 30,000 sets for Henan, and 30,000 sets for Shandong. In addition, the group recently issued 30,000 yuan of relief grain to Henan, and the Provincial Disaster Relief Committee decided to distribute the amount to the counties as follows: 10,200 yuan for Hua County, 2,000 yuan for Wen County, 2,000 yuan for Wuzhi, 2,000 yuan for Fengqiu, 2,000 yuan for Lanfeng, 2,000 yuan for Kaocheng, 1,000 yuan for Kaifeng, 1,000 yuan for Mengjin, 1,000 yuan for Meng County, 700 yuan for Shangqiu, 700 yuan for Shaanxi County, 600 yuan for Chenliu, 600 yuan for Zheng County, 600 yuan for Lingbao, 600 yuan for Qinyang, 500 yuan for Guangwu, 500 yuan for Sishui, 500 yuan for Zhongmou, 500 yuan for Minquan, 500 yuan for Gong County, 500 yuan for Yu County. In addition, 1,080 sets of cotton relief clothes that were previously left undistributed have now been allocated to the two reception centers, 540 sets each.</p>
<h3>New Regulations on Domestic Chinese Telegram Charges by the Ministry of Communications</h3>
<p>Implemented from the First Day of the New Year of the 23rd Year</p>
<p>New Rules for International Telegrams Will Also Be Changed at That Time</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications has revised the regulations for domestic Chinese telegram charges, which will be implemented from January 1. At the same time, international telegrams will be changed according to the new Madrid rules. The following is an exploration of the various methods:</p>
<p>Time of Delivery The Ministry of Communications has issued the following instructions on the time of delivery: "To be viewed by all bureaus and stations, after this, social telegrams received before 8:00 should be delivered after 8:00, and those received after 21:00 should be delivered after 8:00 the next day. Please abide by this order."</p>
<p>Calculation Method The ministry has revised the calculation method for Chinese telegrams as follows: (1) The name of the receiving location and the name and address of the recipient of the above telegrams, not exceeding 15 characters, will be charged as 5 characters. If this is exceeded, the characters will be charged as before. (2) If a telephone number is used instead of the address, the recipient's name and the name of the receiving location will be calculated as a total of 4 characters. (3) Registered addresses and the names of receiving locations will still be charged according to previous regulations. (4) For telegrams sent separately, each additional recipient's name and address will be charged 3 characters. If the address is replaced by a telephone number, 2 characters will be charged. (5) Various fees and business identifications will be charged separately according to regulations. In addition, Chinese and foreign urgent telegrams to and from China should be charged at twice the ordinary telegram rate. The above methods will be implemented from January 1 next year.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Macau Retransmission The receiving and dispatching offices of the Great Northern, Great Eastern, Pacific, and other submarine cable companies have been recovered by our country and should be handled accordingly. It is necessary to consider whether this is applicable to Shanghai-Macau retransmission. A special order was issued to the International Telecommunication Bureau stating, "In order to facilitate public communication, the methods have been revised as follows. Please instruct the Great Northern and Great Eastern submarine cable telegram receiving and dispatching offices to comply." Whether the above method of calculating the recipient's name and address for Chinese telegrams is applicable to Shanghai-Macau telegrams and domestic telegrams transmitted by the Shanghai-Hong Kong submarine cable, and whether the submarine cable fee for domestic urgent telegrams transmitted by the Shanghai-Hong Kong submarine cable is reduced to twice the ordinary telegram rate, please contact and report separately.</p>
<p>International Telegrams For international telegrams, the new Madrid rules will be applied from January 1. The instructions stated, "To all bureaus, Hong Kong bureaus, and Guangdong-Guangxi bureaus and stations, the points where the new Madrid International Telegram Rules differ from the current rules have been summarized in a list by the International Telecommunications Bureau and distributed to each bureau and station. All foreign telegrams to and from China should be subject to the provisions of these new rules from January 1 next year. However, domestic coded telegrams will still be charged at full price, and each telegram will be limited to 5 characters. There is no need to add the (ODE) characters in the header. Please comply with this order."</p>

<h3>Liang Shichun Returns from Europe and America and Discusses Observations on World War II</h3>
<p>Says Conflict Between Russia and Japan is Inevitable</p>
<p>It is Almost Impossible for Us to Maintain Strict Neutrality</p>
<p>Liang Shichun, an executive of the National YMCA, was previously tasked with traveling to Europe and America for research. He has now returned to Shanghai from the United States on the President Hoover. According to Liang's travels in Europe and America, and the results of his talks with foreign dignitaries, he deeply feels that the conflicts of interest between countries are becoming increasingly acute, and war clouds are densely packed internationally. The seriousness of the situation exceeds that of 1914. According to Liang's personal speculation, the second</p>
<h3>World War</h3>
<p>is about to break out soon. When Liang arrived in Shanghai, he made the following remarks to reporters from various newspapers. Liang said, "If we observe from a factual perspective, the precariousness of our current position is unprecedented in history. The secret expansion of armaments by various countries and the intensity of their rivalry far surpass that of 1914. In addition, the rise of nationalism and the panic of the world economy are enough to promote the opening of World War II." Liang believes that the outbreak of World War II will</p>
<h3>Definitely be in the Far East</h3>
<p>Because recently, Russia and Japan have been making every effort to build railways in Siberia that have no commercial value. Their purpose is nothing more than to facilitate the transportation of troops to the war zone when the war breaks out. Although the recent recognition of Soviet Russia by the United States has given Japan a great threat, preventing the war from happening for a while, this move cannot eliminate the root cause of the conflict between Russia and Japan. Soviet Russia has no intention of war because its domestic construction has not been completed, but Japan is the opposite. Japan is deeply afraid that after the completion of Soviet Russia's construction, its national power will inevitably become stronger, which will make Japan feel even more inconvenient. At the same time, the Japanese military is extremely eager</p>
<h3>to fight Russia</h3>
<p>in order to complete its power in Manchuria as soon as possible. Therefore, the outbreak of World War II is feared to be imminent. Liang also said that after the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese War, China should take an attitude of strict neutrality in my personal opinion, but I am deeply afraid that strict neutrality is virtually impossible. It is also heard that Liang once represented China at the Fifth Pacific National Relations Discussion Conference. While in Europe and the United States, he met with U.S. Secretary of State Hull, U.S. Ambassador to Europe Davis, Disarmament Conference Chairman Henderson, French Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour, and other international diplomatic figures. Therefore, his experience is very rich, and his observations are worthy of our reference.</p>
<h3>Economic Council and Others Respond to Xiang Xiamin's Debt Collection Proposal for Reference</h3>
<p>Xiang Xiamin, a Chinese overseas Chinese in Singapore, previously proposed to use cotton and wheat loans to buy domestic public bonds. The details have been reported in the newspapers. Mr. Xiang has now received replies from Chairman Chiang and the National Economic Council. The original letters are recorded below:</p>
<p>Letter from the Economic Council: In reply, your letter suggesting to use cotton and wheat loans to buy domestic public bonds and requesting adoption and implementation has been received. It will be kept for reference. This is a corresponding reply. Please note. To Mr. Xiang Xiamin, Secretariat of the National Economic Council.</p>
<p>Reply from the Commander-in-Chief's Headquarters: In reply, the Chairman has forwarded your presentation suggesting to use cotton and wheat loans to buy domestic public bonds, and instructed it to be sent to the National Economic Council for reference, etc. Therefore, this letter is sent to you for your information. To Mr. Xiang Xiamin, Second Department of the Military Commission of the National Government, Commander-in-Chief's Headquarters in Nanchang.</p>
<h3>Special Bus Service Opened for Staff After Relocation of Municipal Government Bureaus</h3>
<p>Transportation Expenses Under the Unified Management of the Science Section</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, after the relocation of the municipal government and its subordinate offices and bureaus, transportation is the only means for staff to travel back and forth every day before the dormitory problem is resolved. According to the survey by the Public Works Bureau, the number of people working every day is estimated to be more than 700. In order to save time, it is necessary to open a special bus service, except for those who can take ordinary buses or have their own vehicles near Baoshan Road. It is proposed to order the Zhabei Chinese Merchants Public Bus Company to release all twelve vehicles running in the downtown area from 8:15 am and 5:00 pm every day to run a special bus service, directly from the intersection of Baoshan Road to the Municipal Government. The journey time will only take 23 minutes. The fare is tentatively set at 20 cents of small foreign currency. It has been approved by the Municipal Government, but because the income of low-level employees is relatively small, the transportation expenses are too large. The Municipal Government has handed it over to the First Section for unified planning.</p>
<h3>The Second Police District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau Changes the Use of Garbage Bins in Its Territory</h3>
<p>From January 15th of Next Year</p>
<p>Public Bins Will Be Discontinued, and Businesses Will Prepare Their Own Bins</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Public Security and Health Bureaus, in view of the fact that the city's sanitation and cleaning matters have not presented a special effect, are due to the fact that citizens do not pour garbage into the bins. In order to rectify the city appearance, it was presented to the municipal government for approval, and it was decided that from January 15th, 23rd year of the Republic [1934], the public garbage bins originally set up in the territory under the jurisdiction of the Second District and Second Station will be discontinued. Each store will prepare its own garbage bin according to its capacity, and the sanitation bureau's scavengers will go to collect and transport it on time every day, so as to avoid arbitrary dumping and maintain the cleanliness of the roads. Yesterday, a joint announcement was issued, ordering all households, stores, etc. to quickly prepare garbage bins before the 25th of this month to facilitate implementation.</p>
<h3>Attention to Those Who Need Saltpeter and Sulfur</h3>
<p>Announcement No. 5 of the Northern Branch of the Jiangsu Provincial Saltpeter and Sulfur Bureau of the Ministry of Finance: For the purpose of announcement, it is hereby noted that saltpeter and sulfur are important military supplies, so the state has established a bureau to monopolize sales to prevent harm and enrich the tax treasury, and to facilitate merchants and people. All merchants and households who need saltpeter and sulfur, such as fireworks, "silver work," "hunting," "incense industry," "cured meat," "chemical industry," "leather workshop," and other industries, are within the scope of the exclusive sales of this branch. They should all go to No. 1, Lane 1, Qiu'an Li, Meiyuan Road, Zhabei, to purchase according to the amount required. There must be no abuses such as "private hawking," "private wholesaling," "cross-border sales," and "peddling." Those who deliberately violate this will be punished according to the law. For fear of not knowing everything, this announcement is hereby made, so that all should abide by it and not violate it. Sincerely, Gu Xie, Director, December 18, 22nd year of the Republic of China.</p>
<h3>A Guangdong Youth Dies by Poisoning</h3>
<p>A Guangdong youth, surnamed Zhang, 25 years old, used to work in a factory on Nanjing Road. However, because he liked to play and spend money like water, his brother found out and transferred him to work in a factory on Zhejiang Road. Before long, he was transferred back, but economic sanctions were imposed. Zhang felt depressed and unhappy in his heart, and the idea of suicide arose. At 12 o'clock the night before, he returned from the outside and secretly took a heavy dose of medicine and committed suicide. At 11 o'clock the next morning, he had not yet gotten up. His brother entered the room to check and saw that his complexion was pale and he was unconscious. He hurriedly sent him to the Tongren Hospital by car. After the doctor gave him injections and medicine, but because he had taken too much poison, he eventually died after a while.</p>
<h3>The Mastermind of the Assassination of Gu Daosheng Sentenced to Twenty Years in Prison</h3>
<p>Gu Daosheng, a native of Dachang, 29 years old this year, was celebrating his father-in-law, Jin Luting's sixtieth birthday at the Dajilou Restaurant on Xiaodongmen Street in the French Concession on March 26 of this year. At about 3 pm that day, he was lured out on the pretext of delivering gifts and shot to death. Later, a Jiangbei native, Zhang Dianchen, was arrested by a French detective at the Oriental Hotel and sent to the Second Special District Court, where he was sentenced to life imprisonment. After appealing, the sentence was reduced to 15 years. Later, a French detective was dispatched to Changzhou, together with investigators from the Jiangsu Bandit Suppression Headquarters, and a Changzhou native, Zhang Jinbao, the mastermind of this case, was arrested in Yixing and transferred to Shanghai. A public prosecution was filed by the Second Special District Court. After Judge Li Changnian opened court several times to investigate the situation, which has been reported in previous newspapers, the trial has now concluded. Yesterday morning, Judge Li came to the First Criminal Court and sentenced Zhang Jinbao to 20 years of imprisonment for conspiring to commit murder. The number of days of detention before the final judgment was determined to be one day of imprisonment for every two days of detention. The defendant was transferred to the detention center. After the judgment, Tang Hao, the lawyer defending Zhang, declared in court that he did not understand and requested an appeal. The court granted it.</p>
<h3>Fire Broke Out in Ankang Lane Last Night</h3>
<p>At about 11 o'clock last night, a fire broke out on the ground floor of the Wu family at No. 14, Ankang Lane, No. 315, at the corner of Yunnan Road and Jiujiang Road. The fire spread to the stairs, and the fire was blazing, and the situation was very fierce. The Central Fire Brigade rushed to rescue and gradually extinguished the fire at about 12 o'clock. A total of four single-story houses, Nos. 10, 12, 14, and 16, were burned down. Most of the residents in the lane were laborers, so they were all awakened from their sleep when the fire broke out and fled empty-handed, losing all their suitcases and belongings. Deng, a tenant on the upper floor of No. 14, was injured by jumping from the building and has been sent to Renji Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Male Corpse on a Branch on Tongan Road</h3>
<p>At about 6 o'clock yesterday morning, a police officer from the Zhonghua Xinlu Police Station of the Fifth District Public Security Bureau in Zhabei discovered a male corpse hanging on a branch protruding from a fence of a certain surname next to the open space in front of the Guangdong Hospital on Tongan Road. The man was about 40 years old, wearing a black wool coat, black pants, and leather shoes. A hemp rope was tied around his neck, his feet were bent to the ground, and a felt bowler hat was clamped in the rope circle. According to observers, the deceased used to be a police officer. He was dismissed from his post during the January 28th Incident and went home. He had only been in Shanghai for two or three days, and it is unknown why he died there. The police station reported it to the district, and the local security was ordered to report it to the Shanghai Local Court for an autopsy.</p>

<h3>Water Supply to Tonghai Lane in Hongkou Cut Off the Day Before Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Lives of All Residents Are in Imminent Danger</p>
<p>Representatives Will Be Sent to Petition the Municipal Council Today</p>
<p>The Reclamation Bank Announces the Process of Cutting Off Water</p>
<p>According to Xin Xin News Agency, the main pipe of Tonghai Lane, Tongzhou Road, Hongkou, in this city, was suddenly closed by the water company at 10 o'clock the day before yesterday, cutting off the water supply, causing the lives of all residents to be in imminent danger. The various situations obtained by the Xin Xin News Agency reporter are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Petition to the Municipal Council Today</h3>
<p>Tonghai Lane, Tongzhou Road, Hongkou, is managed by the Real Estate Department of the China Reclamation Bank. There are more than sixty houses in total, and the rent for each house is 26 yuan, and the rent for each shop is 34 yuan. The total number of residents is about 2,000, most of whom are poor. Now, in order to oppose the landlord's desire to increase the water bill during this economic depression (4 yuan per house), the water company suddenly closed the main pipe at 10 am yesterday, cutting off the water supply, causing thousands of residents to suddenly have no water to drink, causing great panic, and their lives were in imminent danger. They immediately convened all the residents to discuss countermeasures. As a result, Liu Zhenbo was appointed to petition the Municipal Council today, requesting assistance.</p>
<h3>Reclamation Bank Announces the Process of Cutting Off Water</h3>
<p>The Shanghai China Reclamation Bank Real Estate Department sent a letter to the Xin Xin News Agency yesterday, stating that the department has more than sixty houses in Tonghai Lane, Tongzhou Road, in the eastern district, with a monthly rent of about 1,600 yuan. Most of the residents are middle-class. Since the January 28th Incident, the economy has been depressed and life has been difficult. However, the British Shanghai Water Company secretly canceled the water package system in December of last year, installed water meters, and charged according to the meter, with monthly bills often between 550,000 and 1 million gallons, exceeding the water package system by about three times. This department followed the announcement of the Real Estate Association and temporarily paid according to the original price before the problem was resolved, but the company refused to accept it and threatened to cut off the water supply. Considering that there are nearly a thousand residents in the lane, once the water is cut off, wouldn't the lives and property of thousands of people be in a desperate situation? Therefore, in May, they went to the company to negotiate repeatedly and painfully paid 10% of the rent for water, which was already a large increase compared to the original price. Since May, the company has said that the water price has been revised, but it still exceeds the water package system by three or four times. Considering that the water consumption of the tiger stove and tofu shop is large, they did not hesitate to spend a lot of money to ask the company to dig up the road, re-drain the pipes, and install separate meters, which cost hundreds of yuan, and the water bill is still more than twice as much as the water package system. Just as they were about to collect it from the residents, the company suddenly closed the main pipe and cut off the water supply at 10 am on the 19th of this month. Thousands of residents are in imminent danger. Such actions, I think, will not only harm this department, but I hereby report to your newspaper and quickly ask to uphold justice in order to maintain the lives of the people.</p>
<h3>Japanese Rumors that the HSBC and Astor House Will Be Sold to Japanese Merchants</h3>
<p>Purchased by the Japanese Mitsukoshi Department Store</p>
<p>Intends to Demolish and Build a Ten-Story Building</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Japanese-language Mainichi Shimbun stated that there is a rumor that the HSBC Hotel (Palace Hotel) at the corner of Nanjing Road and the Bund will be bought by Mitsukoshi, the largest department store in Japan, through the mediation of Mitsui &amp; Co. It is heard that after Mitsukoshi buys it, it will completely demolish the existing building and build a steel-framed ten-story building to operate a department store, called Shanghai Mitsukoshi Department Store. However, Mitsui &amp; Co. has denied this statement. It is also rumored that the HSBC Hotel and the Astor House will be renovated as the Hong Kong Shanghai Hotel, including the Astor House address, surrounding the Broadway Road, Astor Road, and Huangpu Road, with more than 30 acres of land and buildings, and sold to Mitsukoshi for 3 million taels. However, it is difficult to prove the truth. However, from the perspective of the fierce commercial warfare in mainland Japan, Japanese goods want to fully compete with the goods of other countries, and it is originally an undeniable fact that they are eager to seek a market in China. Therefore, looking for houses in this city is not a false rumor. At present, foreigners are asking the Japanese Consulate General about the truth.</p>
<h3>A Large Number of Headless Japanese Light Bulbs are Imported as Raw Materials</h3>
<p>Recently, China's import tariffs have increased, and Japanese merchants are greatly frightened, so they collude with unscrupulous merchants to import a large number of light bulbs without copper heads, disguised as raw materials. This has happened more than once. Recently, another 800,000 light bulbs were imported, intending to disrupt the market and defeat China's light bulb products. It is heard that the Shanghai Electrical Appliance Manufacturing Industry Association has already held a meeting to decide on countermeasures in order to save themselves.</p>
<h3>White Russians Hate the Consulate</h3>
<p>Throwing Bricks at the Russian Consulate</p>
<p>Sentenced to a Fine of Thirty Yuan</p>
<p>Most of the White Russian expatriates in Shanghai are opposed to the doctrine of Soviet Russia, resulting in national difficulties and a willingness to wander in other countries and become poor people. The other day, a Russian named A, who held this and the Soviet Union's tenets, was walking alone in front of the Soviet Russian Consulate in Shanghai on the Bund. Suddenly, he was touched by the scene and felt the sadness of his homeland. Without considering the pros and cons, he picked up bricks on the side of the road and threw them at the consulate to vent his anger. This was seen by the patrolling police, who arrested the Russian for overstepping the mark and violating the police law. Yesterday, he was sent to the First Special District Local Court, and the police lawyer Jiang Baolian filed a complaint with the summary court, requesting an investigation. Judge Wu Xiangzu ordered the Russian to be brought to court. According to the confession, he accidentally passed by the door of the Soviet Russian Consulate yesterday and could not help but be touched by the pain of his country's demise.

<h3>Before Su San Was Escorted, Copper Chains Were Locked on Apprentices First</h3>
<p>Gao Defu's Old Play Newly Made</p>
<p>Lu Huichun Was Innocent and Suffered</p>
<p>Lu Chen, a Tianjin woman residing at No. 64, Fengyu Lane, Route Sayzo, French Concession, 35 years old this year, is the wife of the late famous actor Lu Yueqiao. Ten years ago, she entrusted her son, Lu Huichun (17 years old this year), to Gao Defu (40 years old this year, a martial arts actor from Suzhou, currently living with Lu's wife at No. 56 in the same lane) to learn acting, learning civil and martial arts roles. At that time, Lu was still alive. After Lu's death, Gao led Huichun to perform in various ports. Recently, Gao took him to the Shandong Grand Theater in Jinan, Shandong, to perform. Before long, Gao stopped performing and returned to Shanghai, leaving Lu Huichun in Jinan and entrusting a friend to manage him, who is still singing at the Shandong Grand Theater. Because Huichun had been away from home for a long time, he missed his mother very much. Because Gao was not there, he came to Shanghai alone from Jinan at the beginning of the month, and transferred to Suzhou. He arrived in Shanghai on the 18th of this month. He first went to Gao's place to meet him, and then explained to Gao that he wanted to go home to visit his mother. Gao not only refused, but also feared that he would go home privately, so he used a copper chain, the same one used in the play "Su San Escorted," to lock Huichun's hands and feet and confine him in a room in his home, not allowing him to make a sound. However, Huichun's mother, Lu Chen, although living nearby, did not know that her son had returned to Shanghai and was locked up by Gao. The news was spread by Gao's neighbors and detected by the French police, who sent a detective to Gao's house to investigate the day before yesterday. They found Huichun locked up in the room and unable to move freely. They arrested Gao and took Huichun to the police station. After the police chief questioned him, he ordered Gao to be detained. At the same time, he opened the chains for Huichun, informed his mother, and handed him over to be taken back. Yesterday, the police sent Gao to the Second Special District Court for questioning. The prosecutor, Fei Xizhen, said that the defendant had violated the crime of obstructing freedom under the criminal law. The police are currently investigating and have not concluded the investigation. He requested a postponement of the questioning. He also presented the chain as evidence. After reviewing the report in court and questioning the defendant, he was instructed to postpone the questioning until the 29th. The defendant was still detained in the detention center.</p>
<h3>Wanshun Sauce Garden on Hongnan Road Caught Fire Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>The Wanshun Sauce Garden opened by Zhu, located at the intersection of Hongnan Road and Gonghe Xin Road in Zhabei, suddenly reported a fire at 1:10 am yesterday. The patrol officer He Zhaorong of the Zhongxing Road branch of the Fourth District Public Security Bureau dispatched police chief Chen Maoxiu and others to suppress the fire. He also called the fire brigade and drove to rescue. The fire was extinguished at about 2:00 am. Fortunately, the sauce garden was surrounded by high walls, and the neighbors on the left and right were not affected. After investigation, it was found that there were only two apprentices and a clerk sleeping in the sauce garden. All of them escaped without a trace at that time. However, the houses in the garden have been almost completely burned down. It was not until dawn that Police Chief Chen went to investigate the cause of the fire again and was reported by someone in a small teahouse that the clerk, Cai Rongsheng, 27 years old, from Shaoxing, was arrested and sent to the district. According to the confession, the store owner, Zhu, was also from Zhejiang and had gone out for business. The cause of the fire was that an apprentice was ill and cooked dinner, leaving a fire burning in the shavings. At present, the apprentice does not know where he has fled. It is also learned that the store opened on September 30 of this year and has fire insurance.</p>

<p>At about 12 o'clock yesterday afternoon, a fire broke out in the Fu'an Amusement Park on the third floor of the Fu'an Company at the intersection of Xiaodongmen and Dongmen Road in Nanshi due to carelessness with fire. In an instant, the fire was raging and sparks were flying everywhere. The fire brigades of each district heard about it and arrived at the scene to rescue. The fire had already been extinguished by the people in the park. Fortunately, the show had not yet started, and there were no tourists, so there was no major disaster. Only a few miscellaneous items were burned down. Afterwards, the Second Station of the First District, which was in charge of the area, sent police to arrest the owner of the park for questioning.</p>
<h3>Rice Shop in Xuejiabang Robbed, Six Robbers Smearing Black Smoke on Their Faces</h3>
<p>Chen Donglian, a native of Wuxi, 25 years old, has been running the Yuanyuan Rice Shop at No. 125 and 127, Sanjiao Street, Xuejiabang, Nanshi for many years. The business is very good, which is coveted by robbers. At 6:45 the night before, six robbers with Jiangbei accents and looking like workers, four of them wearing blue cloth short coats and trousers, and two of them wearing black long gowns, all with black smoke smeared on their faces, brought four guns. Two robbers held weapons and guarded the door, while the other four robbers broke into the rice shop's counter room, took out guns and threatened the shopkeeper, and robbed 40 yuan of banknotes, more than 200 cents of double cents, more than 40 small foreign tickets, and 4,000 to 5,000 copper coins from the drawer of the account table. After the robbery, they calmly escaped. When the First Station of the First District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau learned about it, they sent police to round up the robbers, but it was too late, and the robbers had already fled. They reported the previous situation to the General Bureau for the record and asked Director Wen to order the districts to cooperate in the arrest.</p>

<h3>"Kuai Shang Kuai" - White Poison Pills</h3>
<p>Busted by the French Police in Rue Chapsal</p>
<p>Recently, the French police have been more strict than before in investigating and cracking down on the secret production and sale of drugs within the French Concession. They dispatch detectives to various alleys and roads every day to investigate secretly. However, some people who disregard the law still dare to commit crimes and secretly manufacture and sell drugs. A few days ago, Chinese and foreign detectives of the French police learned that someone was secretly manufacturing white pills with poisonous ingredients, named "Kuai Shang Kuai," upstairs at No. 160 Rue Chapsal. They were manufacturing them when the night was quiet and people were asleep. The detectives rushed to search the premises at midnight. They found the room brightly lit and the manufacturing in progress. They arrested the shareholders and employees who were secretly manufacturing, Wang Jiasheng (44 years old, from Pudong, residing at the address), Liu Xinfu (28 years old, from Ningbo, residing at No. 3, Huishun Lane, Minguo Road, engaged in the pharmacy business), Xu Shuncheng (42 years old, from Yixing, residing at the address), and Yu Yonglin (27 years old, from Pudong, working as an accountant in the pharmacy at the address). They seized seven large bags of white pills, as well as 148 red pills, three pounds of raw white powder, a pill-making board, a sieve scale, a lamp stand, a ledger, and more than ten yuan in cash from sales. They were all taken to the police station. Yesterday, they were brought to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District. The police lawyer, Fei Xizhen, stated that the police had not yet investigated the case and requested a postponement for a detailed investigation before filing a lawsuit. The evidence was also presented. The detective then reported the process of cracking the case. The defendants hired lawyers such as Wang Shizong to defend them, requesting bail pending investigation. Judge Wu Fanglian briefly questioned the defendants and then ruled that the case was not yet clear and bail was not allowed. The hearing was rescheduled for the 29th. The defendants were taken back into custody separately.</p>

<h3>Painter Collapses and Dies Without Cause in the City God Temple</h3>
<p>Cui Yaonian, a native of Nantong, was in his forties. He brought his wife, Cui Lu, to Shanghai from his hometown and lived in Workshop No. 73 of the Toyota Spinning Mill in Caojiadu. He made a living by painting and had been doing so for many years. He could make a decent living. After breakfast yesterday morning, Cui went to the Liyuan Teahouse in the City God Temple in the city to drink tea with a friend. Around 9:00 AM, he suddenly felt dizzy and unable to sit or stand. He got up to go downstairs and felt a throbbing headache as he passed the fortune-telling shop opened by his fellow villager Zhu Shaoxian at No. 18, Liangting Road. Unable to walk, he entered the fortune-telling shop to sit for a while and rest. Unexpectedly, he collapsed to the ground and groaned continuously. He soon died. The police officer in charge investigated the case, notified Cui's family, and reported it to the court for an autopsy.</p>
<h3>Police Officer Commits Suicide by Hanging After Losing Job</h3>
<p>Li Junshan, a native of Hebei, was formerly a police officer in a district station of the Municipal Public Security Bureau. He was in his forties. Recently, after being dismissed from his job for some reason, he had no food, clothing, or place to live. Feeling the pain of unemployment, he suddenly had the thought of ending his life yesterday morning. He committed suicide by hanging himself on Tiantong'an Road, Shichang Road, in Zhabei. A passerby discovered him and reported it to the police on duty, who reported it to the Fifth District Station for record. The court examined the body and ordered the local security officer to take pictures and collect the body.</p>
<h3>Four Organizations Simultaneously Request Transfer of Soldiers for Collusion with Bandits</h3>
<p>Quan Guangyi Has Been Transferred to the Garrison Headquarters</p>
<p>Wei Zizhong Did Not Appear for Trial</p>
<p>Wei Zizhong, head of the Baowei Guotuan in Suzhou, Anhui, and Quan Guangyi, major battalion commander of the Third Army, were both suspected of colluding with bandits. Their superiors had removed them from their posts and ordered their arrest. The two had recently fled to Shanghai and were hiding at No. 3, Siming Village. Liu Junqing, a detective from the Public Concession Laoza Police Station, discovered this and sent someone to investigate. Unexpectedly, Wei and others falsely accused him of extortion. Liu Junqing then arrested Wei and Quan on Foch Road and brought them to the First Special District Court. Wei was released on bail of 5,000 yuan, while Quan was detained pending investigation. This was reported in the previous newspaper. The case has now been learned by Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the Military Commission stationed in Nanchang. He believes that the soldiers dared to collude with bandits, which is an extreme disregard for discipline. He ordered strict investigation and punishment to maintain military discipline. He specifically telegraphed Wu, Commander of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, to quickly transfer the case to the First Special Court for investigation and trial. Commander Wu then sent Xu Pengfei and Yang Fengqi, staff members of the Garrison Headquarters, to the court yesterday morning to request the transfer. Wen Hongen, Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, also sent a letter to the court requesting the transfer. At the same time, the Security Department of the Anhui Provincial Government, upon hearing that the two criminals had been arrested in Shanghai, also sent a mortar company to Shanghai with documents to escort them back for punishment. In addition, Ni, the regiment commander who was the direct superior of the criminals, also requested the court to approve the transfer. This shows that the two criminals are valued by all parties, and the circumstances of their crimes must be serious. However, when Qian Hongye, Judge of the First Special Court, continued the hearing yesterday, Wei Zizhong failed to appear. Only Quan Guangyi and his defense lawyers Fan Gang and Li Mian appeared to oppose the transfer to the inland. However, Zhang Shizhu, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, stated that since the two had committed serious crimes in the inland, the Public Works Department had no objection to the transfer. Judge Qian Tingliang immediately ruled that Quan Guangyi should be handed over to the personnel from the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for trial. Wei Zizhong should not be transferred.</p>
<h3>Xue Daosheng Convicted of Fraud for Accepting Donations for Licenses</h3>
<p>Xue Daosheng, a native of Yangzhou residing at No. 28 Kunming Road, Hongkou, had worked in the sample-making department of the Public Works Department for many years. He retired recently because he was over half a century old and elderly. In August and September of this year, Rong Xinda wanted to open the Minhua Teahouse at No. 436, West Seward Road, and sing Suzhou opera in the teahouse to entertain guests and attract customers. Xue heard about this and knew that this business required a license from the Public Works Department. He immediately volunteered, saying that he had a good relationship with a foreigner in the donation department and was willing to intercede so that the license could be issued as soon as possible, but he should be rewarded generously. Rong paid him 300 yuan in cash and entrusted him to mediate. Unexpectedly, Xue received the money and there was no news for a long time. Rong suspected he had been cheated, so he hired a lawyer to apply for the license himself in order to open the business. A few days ago, he suddenly met Xue and asked about the license. Xue claimed that the 300 yuan had been given to the foreigner, but he thought the amount was too small, so it had not yet been approved, and he needed to add another 200 yuan to get it done. At this time, Rong understood Xue's intention, so he pretended to agree and made an appointment for 6:00 PM the day before yesterday at the Shanghai Bathhouse on Tiantong Road to pay the money. He reported it to the Hongkou Police Station. When the time came, he prepared 200 yuan in Central Bank banknotes, which were signed by Rong's representative lawyer Ge Zhaoji and Western detective Muhei Deng as identification marks. Then, Rong and Ding Yugao and Ding Fuhai took the money to the Shanghai Bathhouse and handed it over to Xue, who checked that it was correct. Just as he was putting it in his pocket, detectives came in from outside, and they were caught red-handed and taken back to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special District Court. Judge Zhan Liangce interrogated them. The police lawyer Jiang Baolian explained the case. Rong Xinda and the witnesses also gave detailed accounts of the situation at the time. When asked, the defendant confessed: I only asked the plaintiff to give gifts, and the plaintiff gave me 300 yuan to pass on. Later, the foreigner refused to accept it, and I returned the money to the plaintiff that day. Qin Liansheng witnessed it. A few days ago, the plaintiff repeatedly asked me and sent 200 yuan. I had just received it when I was arrested. The court found that the defendant Xue Daosheng was guilty of fraud and sentenced him to two months in prison and ordered him to repay Rong Xinda 300 yuan.</p>
<h3>Kidnapping Case Cracked in a Xi'an Hotel</h3>
<p>Hua detectives Li Minglin and Gu Wenyao of the Jiading Road Police Station arrested two kidnappers, Liu Changtian from Shandong and Ni Shuqing from Anhui, who were both plasterers, at the Xi'an Hotel at No. 1156 Xi'an Road at about 6:00 PM the day before yesterday. They recovered two children, Li Gensheng from Jiangbei and Gu Lin from Tongzhou, both eleven years old, and took them to the police station. The police chief ordered them to be detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District. The police lawyer Zhang Tianyin said that the defendant Liu Changtian claimed at the police station that Gu had been wandering around Xinqiaotou in the French Concession a month ago and was taken in as an apprentice, while Ni Shuqing claimed that Li had been bought from a friend named Xiaoyangzhou in Laoximen two months ago for three yuan. In fact, both defendants wanted to sell the two children. Since there were no employers in Shanghai, they planned to take them to Xiamen, Fujian, to sell them. He requested a postponement for detailed investigation and that the two children be sent to the Women and Children's Relief Society. Li said that his parents were both dead and that he had come to Shanghai with Xiaoyangzhou and was sold to Ni Shuqing as an apprentice. Gu said that he had parents at home and that his father was picking up trash somewhere in Pudong. He had been introduced to work as an apprentice in a paper box shop, but was later fired, leaving him homeless. He met Liu Changtian and followed him to the inn. Judge Wu Zehan interrogated the two defendants. Their statements were evasive. They denied taking the two children to other places to sell them and asked for leniency. He ordered them to be detained and rescheduled the hearing for further investigation. Li and Gu were temporarily sent to the Women and Children's Relief Society for care.</p>

<h3>Yitai Car Robbed on Qu Zhenren Road</h3>
<p>Bandits Forcibly Expel the Driver</p>
<p>The Car Was Found on Route Say Zoong Sa</p>
<p>At 10:50 AM yesterday, an unexpected customer, about forty years old, wearing a gabardine jacket and a copper-basin-style felt hat, suddenly arrived at Yitai Motor Company at No. 188 Hubei Road. The person spoke the Ningbo-Shaoxing dialect of Zhejiang and claimed to be named Li Fuwen. He needed to rent a car to go to Longhua alone and would pay a fare of two yuan. The company's accountant sent driver Luo Xiaobao (32 years old, from Zhenjiang) to drive a Chevrolet convertible with license number 17708 (city license number 649). The customer sat in the car and ordered it to go to the Wugong Hotel at the intersection of Fuzhou Road and Shilu Road first. The driver followed the order and drove to Wugong. When the car arrived, there was a man and two women waiting. They all got into the car together. The charterer sat in the front with Luo and drove southwest all the way. Before long, they had passed the Albert Road over the river and arrived at Damuqiao Road. Someone ordered the car to stop near Nanyang Middle School. The driver stopped the car near the back door and was ordered to drive west for about two hundred steps to a lane. The land was extremely barren and densely surrounded by bamboo fences. There were also three people waiting there, two in short shirts and trousers and one in a long robe. The unexpected guest jumped out of the car, pulled out a pistol, and forced the driver to get out. The driver had no choice but to get out of the car. The person in the long robe got into the driver's seat. The two in short shirts were about to drag the army husband into the lane when they saw three or five passersby. The two in short clothes quickly put the driver back into the car and drove straight to a vegetable garden on Qu Zhenren Road, Dapu Road, and stopped the car. The driver was dragged down by the two in short clothes, and the car drove away to the east without a trace. The driver was driven into the bushes. One person took off his trousers belt and tied the driver up, then fled. Seeing that the people had gone far away, the driver struggled desperately and rolled to the side of the road, where he met two fellow villagers. He asked them to untie him, but the two were afraid. They called a Shandong man from a nearby grass shed. After learning the whole story, the Shandong man untied him. The Shandong man directed him to report to the nearby Baowei Regiment and then took a rickshaw to the new West District to report to the Second District General Office in charge. The patrol captain heard the news and immediately led a large number of patrol officers to search in all directions, but they had already escaped. He then transferred the case to the Second District. Director Li ordered many detectives to go to the scene of the incident to investigate. At the same time, he notified the car company to bail the driver out. It was not until 2:00 PM that the robbed car No. 17708 was found at the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Route Say Zoong Sa. The French police notified the Laoza Police Station, ordering the car company to send someone to open the car and actively investigate the cause of the car theft.</p>

It also evaluates the recent recovery movement and the policy of purchasing raw gold. Zhao Jiade's "New American Foreign Policy" is something we particularly want to know about. Since Roosevelt took office, the ambiguity of foreign policy has made people suspicious. The author lives in the United States, and reading this article will definitely reveal a glimpse of American foreign policy. Other articles, such as Yuan Daofeng's "Deterioration of Japanese-Russian Relations and China," and Shen Zhongmai's translation of "American-Russian Re-establishment of Relations in the Eyes of the Japanese," are all timely works.</p>

<h3>He Chengjun Telegraphs Finance and Education Ministries to Promote Independent Education Funding in Hubei Province</h3>
<p>▲ Education Department Orders Counties to Use Land Reclamation to Subsidize Education Funds</p>
<p>(Hankou Correspondence) The case for independent funding of education in Hubei Province, initiated by Education Director Cheng Qibao and supported by various schools and museums, has been approved by the provincial government and is certain to be implemented. The main points of the plan are that provincial and municipal funding will be independent at the same time. The provincial funds, from the central government's monthly allocation of 200,000 yuan, will be designated to be allocated monthly from the Hubei Customs Transport Bureau's salt tax. The Hankou municipal funds will be allocated from housing rent revenue. Both will be designated as special funds and are not allowed to be used for other purposes. The method of safekeeping is that each educational institution will form a safekeeping committee with various associations and jointly take responsibility. However, since the provincial funds are designated from the salt tax, it is appropriate to consult with the Finance and Education Ministries. In addition to requesting the provincial government to consult with the two ministries, Cheng Qibao also sent a letter to He Chengjun, the Pacification Commissioner stationed in Hubei, to find ways to promote its success. On the 17th, He sent a telegram to Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi and Education Minister Wang Shijie, stating, "Nanjing, Minister Kong, Yongzhi brother, Minister Wang, Xueting brother, I recently received a letter from Hubei Education Director Cheng Qibao stating that Hubei education funding has a precedent of being allocated from the salt tax surcharge. Now, in order to implement the above proposal, it has been proposed that 200,000 yuan be allocated monthly from the central government's allocation by the Hubei Customs Transport Bureau as a special fund for education in Hubei Province. This not only avoids the trouble of central remittance but also has the effect of nearby investigation and collection. The above measures and the regulations of the Education Fund Safekeeping Committee have been submitted to the provincial government for consultation with the Finance and Education Ministries for review. I urge you to send a special telegram to the central authorities to promote its success, etc. Hubei education is greatly affected due to the lack of special funding. When I was in the provincial government, I also once telegraphed the Yuanbu for a request. Now, according to the letter from the director, the various points are very insightful. I especially telegram the two brothers, hoping that you will consider the difficulties of Hubei education and grant the request. I am deeply grateful, He Chengjun." Cheng Qibao believes that Hubei's education is lagging behind, relying solely on this fund is not enough to promote its expansion, and each county's education funding is insufficient, so we must find ways to open up new sources. He further proposed three methods: (1) Most of the existing wasteland in various counties is unmanaged and regarded as waste. The county governments should order the district chiefs to conduct a thorough survey, list them, allocate them as academic property, and widely plant forests and suitable plants, as well as income to subsidize education funds. (2) There is a party fee surcharge in the county government donations of various counties. Now, after investigating that the party fees of various counties are directly issued by the central government, this surcharge should still be collected by the agent collecting the taxes and turned over to the educational administrative agencies of various counties for safekeeping as education funding. (3) For local major products, education donations may be appropriately collected, but it must be submitted to the county government and forwarded to the Department of Finance for the record, and it should be based on not being harsh or disturbing.</p>
<h3>Dai Yingguan Inspects the General Situation of Education in Hebei and Peiping (2)</h3>
<p>Dai Yingguan, Section Chief of the Ministry of Education, is inspecting the education in Hebei Province and Peiping. The situation of education in Hebei Province has been recorded in yesterday's newspaper. Now, the situation of education in Peiping is described below.</p>
<p>Education in Peiping is most developed at the middle school level. There are six municipal schools, and fifty-one private schools that have been registered. There is one municipal normal school, and one private kindergarten normal school attached to the Xiangshan Orphanage. There are only two municipal vocational schools and a vocational class attached to the orphanage. Peiping has many universities and independent colleges. The need for ordinary middle schools is greater than in general cities. However, what is needed are complete middle schools that can cultivate young people with the physical strength and intelligence to enter universities, and whose character is honest and whose thinking is correct. After entering university, they can continue to cultivate themselves and create various experts and national leaders. In this sense, Peiping still feels the lack of middle schools. Although I personally cannot conduct a universal inspection this time, I have generally inspected the public and private middle schools that are representative. Among them, the most profound impression is the Qiu Zhi Girls' Junior Middle School in Xizhimen. Ninety-five percent of the students in the school come from poor families. Their parents are either coolies, vendors, rickshaw pullers, or police officers. The remaining five percent have parents whose economic situation is about 50 yuan per month. The school does not charge students any fees. The school spirit is serious, and the teaching and labor courses are well-equipped. The funding is the responsibility of the school board. Mr. Feng Lidequan is especially enthusiastic in supporting it. Today's education in our country is almost entirely a privilege enjoyed by the rich and powerful. The League of Nations Education Observation Group has already spoken about it. Children from the lower classes are especially unlikely to enjoy middle school education. The establishment of this school is truly good news for poor girls. When Peiping's education circles talk about middle schools, they all praise the attached middle school of the Normal University. Judging from the scientific equipment and teaching situation of each subject, the attached middle school truly lives up to its name. The disadvantage of the school is that there are no student dormitories, which makes it difficult to implement the training spirit. However, the spirit of group training implemented by the school is already very significant. Judging from the equipment and teaching, Municipal No. 4 Middle School and Hebei Provincial Peiping High School are both good. Other schools, such as Yuanman Girls' Middle School's English teaching, group students according to ability in the same grade. The teachers' academic ability and skills are excellent. Yiwen Middle School, famous for implementing the Dalton Plan, has students learning in the workshops very sincerely and happily, and the results are quite impressive. Peiping has two middle schools with the most developed students, namely Zhicheng and Hongda. Each school has more than 1,500 students. Hongda has built quite neat school buildings. Zhicheng has purchased instruments and medicines worth 20,000 yuan, which are taken from the students and used for the students. Those who run private schools should be like this. The common disadvantage of the two schools is that each class has about 70 students, exceeding the regulations of the middle school curriculum, which makes teaching and training extremely difficult. Kongde Middle School has a considerable history. The students' behavior is lively and their Chinese language performance is quite good. However, after inspecting the teaching situation, the students' spirits are too lacking in vigor. There are even those who hide and lie down, and others who stare out the window, thinking that a swan is about to arrive. What is seen from the outside is like this, and it is difficult to say how concentrated their inner lives are on their studies. Peihua Girls' Middle School has very few students. When inspecting, the high school was lecturing on foreign history and foreign geography, using English texts. When asked how Chinese history and Chinese geography were taught, it was said that there was no Chinese history or Chinese geography in high school. There were two classes in its primary school that were lecturing on the Christian Bible. It was said that it was extracurricular homework, but it was clearly class teaching. Generally speaking, the shortcomings of general middle schools in Peiping are: (1) The school buildings are narrow, and most students are day students. (2) The library and science equipment are simple. (3) There is a lack of close contact between teachers and students, and it is difficult to give correct guidance to young people's thoughts and actions. (4) The teaching method is mostly lecture-style. (5) Labor education is mostly neglected. (6) Most of the textbooks for each subject have not been approved. (7) Students' absence records are not strictly checked. (8) Schools charge students too much fees. The kindergarten normal class and attached kindergarten jointly run by the orphanage and the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau have mostly children from poor families. In the current education situation in our country, the poor only have the opportunity to receive primary school and supplementary education. Kindergarten education before middle school and kindergarten is purely a special privilege enjoyed by the rich and powerful. The kindergarten and the Qiu Zhi Girls' Middle School can be called the two major characteristics of Peiping education. The workers' department of the Tzu Institute is entered by graduates of primary schools. During the day, they work in factories, and at night, they still supplement their academic subjects. After three years of work, they are taught the theory of the subjects they have learned, which is a reform and experiment in running vocational education. The municipal vocational school and commercial school can both pay attention to practical training, but the school buildings are small and need to be expanded urgently. Among the universities specially inspected in Peiping, the Northeast University school buildings are divided into three parts, making administration and management difficult. The two colleges of science and engineering have no equipment and must borrow from the engineering college of Peiping University. The school's moral education is purely centered on military training. The students' actions can be called disciplined and their lives are used to hardship. The professors' treatment is no different from that of middle school teachers, but their spirit is excellent. There are many departments in Mingguo College. In the past, students were arbitrarily absent, but now they are actively rectifying it and strictly cracking down on students' absences. Peiping has a large number of schools, but only one section of the Social Affairs Bureau is in charge, and there are very few staff, so supervisors have no time to inspect the schools. Tianjin has a municipal education bureau as an ordinary city, and Qingdao, although a municipality directly under the central government and small in scope, also has an education bureau. Only Peiping, which had a supervision bureau since the Qing Dynasty, has now been abolished. If the municipal government's finances are strained, if it can plan comprehensively or save some of the money for entertaining guests every month, it will not be difficult to restore the Municipal Education Bureau. Only with a sound municipal education bureau can Peiping's education be discussed and rectified. (End)</p>

<h3>Last Night's West Qing Women's Basketball: Liangjiang Defeats Green Team</h3>
<p>Southeast A Wins Against Telephone Company</p>
<p>Southeast B Loses to American Women</p>
<p>丨Liangjiang and Southeast Score Four Wins Out of Four Games丨</p>
<p>Last night's West Qing basketball featured a women's game between Liangjiang and the Green Team, which was not particularly exciting. Liangjiang relied on Yang Sen's strength to win 20-13. The American Women's team performed well, defeating Southeast B 33-13. Southeast A, after changing instructors, seemed to have regressed in skill, defeating the mediocre Telephone Company 33-17. The forwards were too hasty, missing numerous shots near the basket, and the defenders appeared flustered, giving the opponents opportunities to attack. In the other two games, the Red Team defeated Ma Ling 21-13, and the Blue Team defeated the Yellow Team 24-15.</p>
<h3>Liangjiang Defeats Green Team</h3>
<p>Although this match was relatively important, the chaotic situation made it less interesting. The Green Team's forwards were clumsy and their shooting skills were quite rudimentary. The defenders were better. Liangjiang's Chen Rongming was slightly lacking, while the forwards relied on Yang Sen's performance. The defenders were best represented by Chen Baixue. After the initial exchange, Yang Sen opened the scoring. The Green Team then scored a point through Han Mengte. After that, the two sides were evenly matched, with few scoring opportunities. The Green Team bravely shot but lacked the skill, leaving them frustrated. The first quarter ended in a 4-4 tie. From the first quarter onwards, Liangjiang's Xu Suifeng replaced Chen Rongming, and Yang Sen continued to score. The Green Team did not weaken, and the situation remained even. After 9-7, Chen Rongming re-entered, but the first half had already ended. After the break, Liangjiang worked hard to attack, and the Green Team resisted desperately. Neither side scored for a long time. Liangjiang then opened up a path and gradually improved, but before long, Pan Mengshi, Ruixia, and Chen Hongying were fouled out one after another. Therefore, in the final quarter, the Green Team tried to counter-attack, and Han Mengte made two free throws. Liangjiang was unwilling to let go, and in a final struggle, Liangjiang won 20-13. The referee was strict at first and then lenient, and tended to nitpick.</p>

<h3>American Women Beat Southeast B</h3>
<p>The American Women's team had a wonderful performance, with the three forwards connecting exceptionally well. White was even more outstanding, being both calm and agile, certainly not just relying on brute force. The team's strength was far superior to that of the Green Team. Southeast B did not weaken and also had some good performances, but the defenders often sent long balls forward, preventing the forwards from catching up and wasting opportunities. The forwards did not connect well, and Chen Zaichun was selfish, often using long shots, which were rarely successful. The first half ended 25-9, and the final result was 33-13, with the American Women winning. The referee was lenient, failing to call fouls when necessary, which was the opposite of the previous game.</p>

<h3>Southeast Wins Against Telephone Company</h3>
<p>Southeast's basketball skills have regressed rather than improved. The defenders' skills are quite lackluster and not as good as before. The forwards Hua Wenhua is too dull, Xu Wenying is lively, and Liao Zhuyuan is too hasty. Only Ren Shu is relatively outstanding. The team's new coach seems to instruct without practicing, and practice without instructing, which has led to this situation. The Telephone Company's Bolato was brave and extraordinary, repeatedly making contributions. After the start, Bolato scored three points first, and then Southeast scored twelve consecutive points in one go. In the second quarter, the Telephone Company's momentum was strong, taking the lead with 8-6. In the third quarter, the situation was even. In the fourth quarter, Southeast's edge was revealed again, winning 33-17.</p>

<h3>Recent Scores of Each Team</h3>
<p>Since the start of women's basketball, four weeks have passed. The Liangjiang and Southeast A teams have won every game and remain in the most advantageous position. The Green Team's rowers cannot shoot and are not to be feared. The American Women's team is very strong, with excellent shooting and passing by the forwards, which is rarely seen. Therefore, they also have the hope of winning the championship. The scores of each team up to last night are recorded below:</p>

<h3>The Middle School Football Final: Pudong and Yuqing Battle to a Draw</h3>
<p>1-1 = Each Team Scores One Goal in Each Half, After Extra Time, Both Sides Still Tied, Second Final Next Wednesday</p>
<p>Yesterday was the date of the Middle School Football Final. The elite troops of Pudong and Yuqing arrived on time. The cheering squads from both sides totaled no less than three or four hundred people, and the shouting was deafening. The situation was quite lively, and the offense and defense of both sides were evenly matched. The actions were also very peaceful and upright. Unfortunately, the coldness suddenly increased yesterday, and many athletes on the field suffered from muscle strains, which naturally affected their performance. The result was a 1-1 draw. Twenty minutes of extra time were added, but neither side gained anything. However, the spirit of struggling on the right track is enough to be admired by the Jiangda Football League. The battle situation is briefly recorded below:</p>
<p>▲Li Muyao Scores the Goal After Chen Jixiang blew the whistle to start the battle, the Pudong heroes immediately pressed aggressively into Yuqing's defense zone. Wu Jiugao repeatedly repelled the enemy's attack. Luo Douwen's long-legged kicks had the charm of Luo Haiguang. He opened fire from a distance, and his strength was amazing. It was a pity that the goal was short and the ball was high, so he could not score. Li Jinji summoned the three armies and invaded the south for the second time, like wolves and tigers, with great momentum. In an instant, they broke into the opponent's penalty area. Weng Kefa missed a kick, and Li Muyao rushed to kick and shoot directly into the goal. The Pudong support team was overjoyed and ecstatic.</p>
<p>▲Fu Zhibin Takes Revenge The Pudong formation is characterized by neatness, which is not easy to shake under any circumstances. In terms of talent, Yuqing's forwards are quite brave, but they are all brave men and cannot achieve anything. After Pudong scored a goal, the situation became more chaotic. After the break, Yuqing's instructor Zhang Zhizhen gave instructions, and things began to improve slightly. After holding on until 57 minutes, Yuqing's five forwards besieged Pudong's goal for a long time without success. Fu Zhibin was an veteran after all. At the 15-yard mark, he found a gap and shot, making it a tie.</p>
<p>▲After Extra Time Seventy minutes passed like a flash. Both sides scored a goal, so twenty more minutes were added to determine the winner. After exchanging defense zones, Yuqing's momentum was quite strong, but they repeatedly missed opportunities. In the first ten minutes, Pudong conserved its strength to defend, and Yuqing could only call in vain. In the last ten minutes, the defense zones were adjusted again, and most of the soldiers on both sides had muscle strains. They had no intention of fighting, and the score was 0-0 at the end of the game. It has now been decided to hold a second final next Wednesday.</p>

<h3>Cheng Yize Hosts a Banquet to Celebrate the Chinese Race Walking Team's Achievements</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 19th) at 8:00 p.m., Cheng Yize, chairman of the Chinese Race Walking Association, hosted a banquet at his private residence on Matterhorn Road to celebrate the Chinese team's double championship. In addition to all the members of the Chinese race walking team, there were also Shen Siliang, Hao Gengsheng, Yu Hengzhi, Shi Youhui, as well as the president of the International Race Walking Association, Mr. Littell, vice president McKenna, honorary secretary Mayfe, and more than fifty other people. Mr. Cheng personally greeted the guests with great hospitality, which was much admired. During the banquet, Mr. Cheng first stood up to give a speech, saying that he was very pleased that the Chinese race walking team had won the double championship again. He hoped that the athletes would maintain their past spirit, continue to maintain the championship, and bring glory to the country. He had prepared a simple meal tonight to celebrate, and he was also very honored that Hao Gengsheng, Shen Siliang, Littell, and McKenna had come to give guidance. After the speech, Mr. Littell and McKenna spoke one after another, expressing their admiration for the beautiful posture of the Chinese team members and hoping that they would win the championship every time. They also thanked the Chinese people for their assistance in making the event a success. Next, Hao Gengsheng and Shen Siliang gave speeches. The former mentioned that the government has recently paid great attention to sports, and that the Chinese race walking team has achieved such great results that it will definitely be able to win glory for the country on the world stage in the future. The latter gave a brief explanation of the Chinese team's participation in the competition with new players, and the Chinese Race Walking Association's preparations for participating in the 1936 World Games held in Germany. He also hoped that the athletes would practice actively and live up to their mission. He also praised Shi Youhui and Lu Yutian for their enthusiastic service and indispensable contributions. Mr. Shen also said that the sudden refusal of the racecourse to lend the venue for reasons was a great impact on Sino-foreign relations, and he deeply regretted the inappropriate measures taken by the racecourse. Finally, Shi Youhui stood up on behalf of the race walking team to thank Chairman Cheng for his enthusiastic promotion and repeated banquets. The atmosphere was lively and grand, and the banquet did not end until midnight.</p>
<h3>Zexin and Jiande to Compete for the Xiangbin Table Tennis Cup Tonight</h3>
<p>丨At the Ningbo Fellow Association丨</p>
<p>The first champion of the Xiangbin Table Tennis Cup was the Tianma team, the second champion was the Jiande team, the third champion was the Tianma team, the fourth champion was the Tianma team, and the fifth champion was the Zexin team. The Tianma team has won the championship three times in a row. According to the rules, if they win one more time, they can permanently keep the cup. Unfortunately, the Shanghai Racecourse Club has recently lost its base of table tennis tables due to the location of the new club, and the Tianma team has disappeared invisibly, which is a pity. Otherwise, the Jiande and Zexin teams, who are competing for the championship this year, would have a major threat. Tonight at 8:00 p.m., the Jiande and Zexin teams will compete in the final at the Ningbo Fellow Association on Xizang Road. The meeting of two heroes will surely be a spectacle. Those who wish to visit must purchase tickets in advance. (Tickets are 20 cents each and are sold at the club inside Luhuatang on Mahuo Road.)</p>
<h3>28 Teams Participate in the Second Federation Cup Table Tennis Tournament</h3>
<p>▲Opening on January 5 Next Year</p>
<p>Since the election of new executive and supervisory committee members, the Shanghai Chinese Table Tennis Federation has been making great progress in the construction of the association. The second Federation Cup organized by the association has attracted 28 teams to compete, breaking the record of 24 teams in the first tournament. The association originally planned to start the tournament immediately, but due to the proximity of the New Year, most groups will be on holiday at that time, so it has been decided to start the tournament at 7:30 p.m. every night from January 5 next year. The competition schedule is currently being arranged, and it will be sent to each team as soon as it is arranged. For the convenience of the association's operations, the address of the association is located on the second floor of the Zhonghua Jiande Association on Fusheng Road (telephone number 46852). If you have any questions, please contact them directly.</p>

<h3>Zhonggong Women's Basketball Defeats Nanshang</h3>
<p>At 3:30 p.m. yesterday, a fierce friendly women's basketball competition was held at the China Public School court on Beidang Road. At the beginning of the game, Nanyang High School scored consecutively, making the score 5-0. Zhonggong tried to counterattack, but ultimately fell behind. The first half ended with Nanyang leading 12-5. At the beginning of the second half, Zhonggong reorganized and changed its lineup, working hard to counterattack. They ultimately won 23-21, with Zhonggong making a comeback. It was not easy to be able to turn the tide in a serious situation. The referee was Qian Zhiyuan.</p>

<h3>A List of Surveys on National Arts Halls in Various Provinces and Cities</h3>
<p>Since its establishment five years ago, the Central National Arts Hall has not been able to set up branch halls due to difficult funding. The establishment of National Arts Halls in various provinces and cities has now spread throughout the country. All funding is raised by the provinces and cities themselves. According to a person from the hall, a total of 25 places have been reported as established. Except for Jiangsu and Hubei provinces, which have been suspended, there are currently 23 places. Although the number of National Arts branch halls in various provinces and counties that have been established has not been surveyed in detail, it is estimated that there are no less than 300 in total, averaging ten counties per province.

<h3>Alas, the Alarming Trade Deficit of 900 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>The International Trade Bureau reported to the Ministry of Industry that the trade deficit for the first half of this year was over 474 million yuan, and it is estimated that the total for the year will be about 900 million yuan. Readers, please close your eyes and consider this alarming number. The trade deficit of a country increases year after year to this record high. This phenomenon has never been seen since the opening of trade. On average, each person must bear more than two yuan worth of foreign goods. How can this be ignored? I think that even if the Chinese people are numb and unfeeling, and unaware of the danger, they should be shocked and awakened when they see foreign goods flooding the market and domestic products shrinking. They should quickly find a countermeasure. There is no such thing as sitting back and waiting to be cut up and suffocated. This year, European and American countries have felt the dumping of Japanese goods, and twenty-seven countries have jointly worked to resist it by increasing taxes, restricting imports, issuing import permits, and managing exchange rates. Even Japan itself has measures to control import and export trade. The government and the industry stand on the same front, taking unified action. Their vision, flexibility, and policy sophistication, and the comprehensiveness of their prevention methods have been reported in various newspapers. Only our country, which has a large trade deficit, turns a blind eye and allows foreign goods to seize our market and suck our marrow, leading us to a point of no return. I know that anyone with blood and a conscience cannot bear to sit idly by. I would like to briefly state my opinions as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The National Economic Council should promptly prepare for the establishment of an Import and Export Trade Control Bureau to conduct thorough research on whether there are substitutes for the most foreign goods, and make every effort to restrict them.</p>
<p>(2) The Thick Production National Standard Mark Ordinance has already been promulgated. The government should implement it promptly, without further extensions, so as not to miss the opportunity to develop domestic products.</p>
<p>(3) Shanghai's various organizations and institutions should continue the spirit of this year in 1934 for the Second National Products Year, and mobilize for a while. It is best to use all our energy and strength to promote and use domestic products in this year.</p>
<p>(4) The government should issue a circular to all agencies and schools across the country that any foreign goods found in the procurement of goods will not be reimbursed.</p>
<p>(5) The government or local organizations should organize a National Products Committee to review or identify imported goods and study whether there are substitutes for them, so as to encourage imitation.</p>
<p>(6) It is said that 1934 will be officially designated as the Women's National Products Year. From now on, the general ladies, grandmothers, and young ladies will bear greater and more meaningful responsibilities. I sincerely hope that everyone will work hard.</p>
<p>(7) All schools across the country, large, medium, and small, should unite and work hard in this national products movement, carrying out a general mobilization of the national academic community.</p>
<p>(8) The national products promotion in 1934 should start from practical aspects. Rather than issuing empty arguments, it is better to show our true skills.</p>
<p>If the whole country can do this, the 900 million yuan trade deficit may be reduced year by year, and even eliminated. It depends on the strength of the government and the determination of the Chinese people.</p>
<p>National Products Talk</p>
<h3>Don't Use Foreign Goods, Don't Get Married</h3>
<p>— Natural</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Fengshan of the Zhuanqiao Farmers' Education Center has organized a marriage reform association. Most of the local people have joined this association. However, the first condition for marriage reform is, "Don't use foreign goods, don't get married." It is said that the supervision is very strict, and the correction is very severe. If one of the new couple is a little careless and buys foreign goods, then without hesitation, they are asked to postpone the wedding. From head to toe, from top to bottom, every shoe, every sock, every thread, must be entirely domestic goods. Otherwise, no matter how affectionate you are, you are not allowed to become a beautiful couple, or complete a good marriage. This approach is a good example of promoting domestic goods. Extending this further, matchmakers can also put on a stern face and say: If you don't use domestic goods, I won't be a matchmaker. Wedding officiants can also sit upright and say, if you don't use domestic goods, I won't officiate your wedding. In this way, every pair of new couples will use domestic goods, and every little baby born next year will also use domestic goods. Then, if Chinese people use Chinese goods, even if there are many foreign goods, who will patronize them? The import surplus of 900 million yuan may gradually decrease, even to the point of disappearing.</p>
<h3>Women and Domestic Goods</h3>
<p>— Yingdai</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, in a family managed by a housewife who dislikes using foreign goods, it is difficult for foreign goods to gain a foothold. Therefore, a virtuous housewife should be a pioneer in promoting domestic goods. If her husband buys foreign goods, she should not only not welcome them but also rebuke him. This will make her husband not only afraid to buy foreign goods for his wife but also afraid to buy them for himself. As a result, in the family managed by this virtuous housewife, foreign goods will have no room to extend their reach.</p>
<p>However, how many such housewives are there in the big city of Shanghai where we live? To be honest, they are truly rare. Most housewives in Shanghai not only do not know that they have the mission of promoting domestic goods, but they always love to use foreign goods in the opposite direction. If they ask a man to buy something outside, if it is domestic goods, even if it is very good, they will say it is not good; if it is foreign goods, even if it is not good, it is good. As a result, every family is filled with traces of foreign goods. We cannot blame women entirely, but women are at least responsible for more than half of the problem.</p>
<p>The bad habit of women who love to use foreign goods is not formed overnight, but is cultivated from childhood by various influences from the environment. A young girl, born into a middle- or upper-class family, whose parents are the vanguard of loving to use foreign goods, so in her childhood, what she hears and sees early on is the idea that foreign goods are better than domestic goods. In school, most of the female classmates are the same, sharing the same ailment, and everyone worships foreign goods. In adolescence, the only important condition for making boyfriends is to be a young man who wears a Western suit. If someone's lover doesn't wear a Western suit but wears Chinese clothing, they are a bumpkin, and it is truly embarrassing! Once they become housewives, the psychology of loving to use foreign goods has already taken root and cannot be changed.</p>
<p>Under such circumstances, in their youth, most men remove their Chinese clothing and put on Western suits as the first important thing in order to cater to women's main conditions for making friends. Once they have a lover, they eat Western food, give foreign goods and imported goods as gifts. When the relationship matures and they get married, the wife worships foreign goods, so naturally, they use as much foreign goods as possible to enhance the feelings between husband and wife. Under these circumstances, countless foreign goods invade ordinary Chinese families, causing Chinese people to pay a lot of money to foreign countries every year!</p>
<p>Foreign goods are able to flood the Chinese market, and the Chinese people, both men and women, should bear the blame, but we feel that women are an even more important factor. If a housewife can promote domestic goods as much as possible and reject foreign goods, then the power of foreign goods in China will not be difficult to eliminate immediately. Therefore, a virtuous housewife should be a pioneer in promoting domestic goods. If all the housewives in China can take on the mission of promoting domestic goods, the result will definitely be the overthrow of foreign goods, making them disappear from the Chinese market!</p>

<h3>The Service Spirit That Employees of Domestic Goods Businesses Should Have</h3>
<p>— Quan Jia</p>
<p>I believe that to seek the development of domestic goods businesses, the most important thing to pay attention to is the service ethics of employees. To go one step further, this is the most effective advertisement. We should enthusiastically utilize it in our domestic goods businesses. Xiaozong Wu said it very well in "Life in Japan."</p>
<p>"...No matter how much effort you give him (referring to the merchant) in a Japanese store, no matter how you choose goods, if you can't find what you want, you can just not buy it. When you leave his store, he will still kneel down and salute you very respectfully, and say, 'Thank you, please come again next time!' He will never make you feel even a little unhappy."</p>
<p>The stone of another mountain can be used to polish jade. This is not the case with Chinese stores. If you don't buy anything and take up a lot of his time, the polite ones will give you a look of disdain, and the impolite ones will give you a condescending look or even scold you. This is the reason for the failure of Chinese businesses. In fact, you should ask yourself, why don't people like your goods? On the one hand, you can compare the goods and prices to see if they are worth buying. There is a Western proverb: "The buyer's eye is the fairest." If you often think about this, your business will not fail. Employees of our domestic goods businesses! We should seriously change our bad habits from the past. This is the most economical advertising technique!</p>
<p>We should not exaggerate the goodness of the goods, as this only exposes the Chinese people's ability to lie and refuses customers to visit a second time. We must sincerely explain to customers that domestic goods urgently need the support of the public. Even if they don't buy anything, we must be friendly.</p>
<p>The Chinese Vocational Education Society has obtained the conditions required by the industry for apprentices: honesty, responsibility, loyalty, trustworthiness, obedience, diligence, hard work, and health.</p>
<p>Strive! This is our business creed.</p>

<p>Discussion of Domestic Goods</p>
<h3>Cost Accounting System and Domestic Goods Business</h3>
<p>— Zhou Chengxun</p>
<p>At present, the authorities of general domestic goods businesses, in addition to often thinking about expanding operations and improving products, there is another thing that can be said to be urgently planned and busily calculated, which is the issue of the cost of production. Indeed, if we find a manager or director of a domestic goods factory and ask him how much material is needed for a certain product? How much labor? What is the total cost? It can be said with certainty that there is no specific answer. They calculate periodically and settle accounts annually, only knowing how much surplus or deficit there is, but what is the fundamental cause of the surplus or deficit? Which products can make a profit? Which products are actually losing money? There is no way to show. Therefore, a cost accounting system is very worthy of being urgently adopted and implemented by business operators, especially in the fledgling domestic goods industry.</p>
<p>The general public mistakenly believes that the scope of cost only includes all raw material and labor costs in manufacturing. In fact, it is not that narrow. For every item sold, its cost, in addition to the above part, should also include the expenses of personnel management and sales promotion, and then the total cost can be obtained. In other words, it is not enough for a factory to obtain the cost of all products, because this is general and unclear. We must find out the unit cost of each product. These points in particular must rely on cost accounting.</p>
<p>Is the domestic goods business showing a vigorous vitality today? But if you only work on publicity and sales and ignore the cost, this step is unreasonable. Anyway, a factory can truly understand the unit cost of various products, and only then can it have reliable preparation for formulating sales prices and establishing profits in business policies. Moreover, in the recent bad situation of competition among the same industries, in order to establish one's own footing and resist external struggles, cost accounting is a truly powerful aid.</p>
<p>Checking many larger-scale domestic goods factories, it is rare to find those that implement a cost accounting system. In fact, to establish a cost accounting system, you must first have a sound accounting organization. Many authorities of domestic goods factories like to adhere to the old-fashioned accounting and are unwilling to reform and utilize it well. This is absolutely wrong. Now I dare to list several points below about the effectiveness of cost accounting for businesses:</p>
<p>(1) Because under the cost accounting system, all raw materials, semi-finished products, and finished products are recorded in detail, completely, accurately. Using the book inventory method, the quantity of storage, receipt, issue, and inventory can be displayed daily, thereby preventing the malpractices of waste, misuse, and leakage.</p>
<p>(2) Various products have separate cost calculations to distinguish the profits and losses of various products, which can provide operators with a policy for making choices in manufacturing.</p>
<p>(3) From the above results, a suitable and profitable selling price can be formulated for each product.</p>
<p>(4) The cost calculations of previous years can be collected, analyzed, and compared to report to investors. Moreover, because the source of profits in previous years is clearly indicated, it can be used as a reference for future operations.</p>
<p>(5) Under the cost accounting system, even if personnel are frequent and management is complex, because each department has clear levels of office and each has a chain of responsibility, an internal restraint organization is indirectly formed.</p>
<p>(6) All factories in the same industry have real cost calculations, which can be compared with each other to determine ways to save expenses and reduce costs.</p>
<p>Based on the above points, it is determined that the benefits that the cost accounting system gives to the business are very large. The authorities who operate domestic goods businesses should first recognize that cost accounting is the best aid for business progress and should never cherish the mental and financial resources when preparing for implementation. At the same time, the old-fashioned accounting, which largely lacks the cultivation of principles, should be abolished and new-style accounting should be implemented first, and then the cost accounting system can be discussed.</p>
<p>The main purpose of this article is to explain the close relationship between the cost accounting system and the domestic goods business. As for how to design and implement it, it is not within the scope of this article. I would like to leave it for further discussion!</p>
<h3>Random Thoughts on Domestic Goods</h3>
<p>— Qinian</p>
<p>To cultivate future citizens to use domestic goods, mothers must take more responsibility to instill the concept of loving domestic goods in children's minds.</p>
<p>To avoid the temptation of foreign goods, it is best to avoid living in Western-style houses, because the decoration of Western-style houses always requires foreign goods.</p>
<p>Hosts of banquets should be ashamed of using shark fins and other enemy goods. In fact, using those does not necessarily show your wealth, but rather shows your personality.</p>
<p>"Every thread and every grain of rice should remind you of how hard it was to obtain." should be changed to "Every thread and every object must be checked to see if its origin is domestic goods."</p>
<p>What shop assistants say is sometimes unreliable, so to buy domestic goods, it is best to go to honest and reliable domestic goods places.</p>
<p>You cannot completely blindly follow; you should also discern when others persuade you to buy something and you suspect it is foreign goods.</p>
<p>No matter where you can wield authority (such as in the family or in society), you should be a model of promoting domestic goods. This will naturally be more effective than having low-level people shout about promoting domestic goods. However, you must be consistent in your words and deeds to avoid losing their trust.</p>
<p>Most of the trademarks that use foreign words are cosmetics and cigarettes. They say they are taking advantage of the customer's psychology, but they are actually committing suicide in terms of their own sales.</p>
<p>At the end of the Domestic Goods Year, what we look forward to is only the impression of several domestic goods parades and domestic goods promotions. I would like to propose that domestic goods companies and stores form a "Domestic Goods Street," so that not only will it be convenient for customers to purchase, but the products will also compete to improve.</p>
<p>Random Talk on Domestic Goods</p>
<h3>How to Protect Skin in Winter</h3>
<p>— Ms. He Liying</p>
<p>▲ Night Cream among Domestic Goods</p>
<p>Winter is here, and in order to protect their delicate faces, young men and women in general have made cosmetics such as cold cream their only benefactor. Oh! "Snow" and "Frost" abound, with so many varieties that the eyes are dazzled, and the masses each choose and buy the items they love.</p>
<p>However, well-manufactured items such as cold cream can indeed form a thin film on the skin's surface, preventing the invasion of wind and sun, and at the same time, making the skin white, delicate, and maintaining its youthful beauty. It is especially necessary to use cold cream as a base before applying powder and rouge. However, if you use inferior products, there will be the disadvantage of blocking pores! Therefore, you must choose carefully when purchasing cold cream.</p>
<p>Cold creams can be roughly divided into two types: one is for daytime use, which is non-greasy cold cream (Western name: Day Cream). Most of the cold creams sold on the market are of this type. The other is for nighttime use before going to bed, which is greasy cold cream (Western name: Night Cream). This product has long become a daily cosmetic staple in European and American countries. Especially in winter, human skin naturally contracts due to the cold weather, feeling a lack of fat and dryness. Therefore, artificial fatty cold cream must be relied upon to moisturize it and promote the metabolism of the skin itself.</p>
<p>Now, this kind of night cream has also been produced in fine quality among domestic goods. As far as I know, the "Fangze Zhi" produced by the China Chemical Industry Society is a very beautiful fatty cold cream.</p>
<p>The color of Fangze Zhi is exceptionally lovely and pure white, and the fragrance has a subtle almond scent. When you put it on your arms, head, and neck before going to bed, the oily substance it contains can penetrate the pores, removing all the dirt and grease received during the day, directly making the skin white and radiant, and preventing roughness, chapping, frostbite, and other problems on the skin. It is indeed a benefactor for beauty-loving ladies during this winter season.</p>
<p>Finally, I have one more thing to tell readers, which is that the price of this product is half the price of similar foreign products, so it is also very economical.</p>
<h3>A Domestic Goods Pilgrimage in the Countryside</h3>
<p>— Xuan Wan</p>
<p>This time, because of illness, I took leave and returned to my hometown. In this huge, monster-like temple, I left the paper-drunk and gold-obsessed city and arrived at my already dilapidated village—a small town in western Zhejiang. Having not returned for more than a year, everything naturally seemed different to me. The once bustling market is now deserted and frightening. The successive failures of silk and rice are naturally their fatal wounds. Seeing the calloused hands and feet of the farmers, after several layers of deep and painful wounds, their faces, which were full of deep wrinkles, were filled with depression and lifelessness. "The countryside is bankrupt," this cry has already been heard numbly and witnessed with my own eyes. After I felt deep pain in this, I was filled with a burst of excitement due to natural arousal, and I went on a domestic goods pilgrimage in the countryside.</p>
<p>Sure enough, most of the items in the countryside are still purely local goods. However, as long as you inspect the few foreign goods and sundry stores in the market, you will be greatly surprised. Seven or eight out of ten of the items filling the store cabinets and windows are completely authentic foreign goods, and most of these foreign goods are enemy goods. They are completely using dumping tactics, leading to the lowest prices, to seduce our ignorant villagers, whose purchasing power is weak to the extreme. The malicious intentions and despicable measures are beyond indignation. As for the real countryside, on the banks of the fields and on the rice threshing floors, there are only a few shouting vendors, their clear throats carrying a pair of heavy loads, what with washbasins! Overshoes! Towels and socks! ... All the daily necessities of rural families can often be seen in our domestic goods here. However, they are all inferior goods, and even more inferior goods. This is probably due to price considerations!</p>
<p>Although relieving the countryside and resisting enemy goods are our entire problems, which cannot be solved in a short time, we are ultimately too dissatisfied with witnessing this strange phenomenon. The impression it gives us is that farmers' weak purchasing power leads to opportunistic activity of enemy goods and rampant merchants taking advantage of this. Therefore, we should now use direct advertising or effective publicity, preferably to reduce costs and sell at low prices, to first influence the villagers, and then gradually seek a thorough method of resistance. As for my review of domestic goods in the countryside this time, although it cannot represent the entire countryside, it at least gave us a very good lesson and aroused our attention later on.</p>
<p>Visit Notes</p>
<h3>Notes on Visiting the National Exhibition of the Young Women's Christian Association</h3>
<p>— Zhang Mengzhao</p>
<p>The words "Domestic Goods Year" will soon be quickly rotated away with the giant wheels of the era of 1933! As we examine the past and look to the future, we cannot help but feel sad! Feel heartbroken! What is sad is that patriots are shouting loudly, calling for the promotion of domestic goods and alerting compatriots, but: how many people can reform and be happy to use local goods? The facts tell us, it is simply heartbreaking to look back!</p>
<p>What is heartbreaking is that foreign goods are becoming more rampant with the domestic goods movement! Isn't it? Do the statistics on the import of grease incense powder, as the newspapers tell us, sound horrifying? As the new and old years are about to alternate, there are two domestic goods exhibitions, making a final struggle! Effort! One is the Shanghai Special District Domestic Goods Movement Conference sponsored by the China National Products Manufacturers Association, and the other is the Women's Domestic Goods Exhibition sponsored by the Shanghai Young Women's Christian Association, shining with great light at the end of this year! I believe that the latter is more urgent and more necessary than the former, because from the standpoint of Chinese women, they hold full power over the rise and fall of domestic goods. The diet, clothing, and household utensils of husbands, sons, and daughters all depend on the lady of the house. Therefore, on the opening day of the association's domestic goods exhibition, I eagerly drove to see it with Yunqing, to learn from it. Although this very meaningful grand event of the National Exhibition was held in the imperialist concession of the ten-mile foreign market and in tall Western-style buildings, it gave us Chinese a very deep and far-reaching impression! After our visit, we were very satisfied! The satisfying thing is that the display of domestic goods does not emphasize stiffness but emphasizes three-dimensional and active styles. The most valuable thing here is the "Model Family" arranged by the China National Products Company! The domestic goods displayed, such as steel beds, dressing tables, wardrobes, drawers, rattan chairs, and mahogany furniture, are actually bright and clean, shining in the eyes. They are divided into three grades: 500 yuan, 1,000 yuan, and 2,000 yuan. It is truly a good program for people to emulate. The 2,000-yuan family seems too aristocratic. Those who are capable can of course follow suit, but ordinary people should still follow the 500-yuan style! On that day, the young men and women who visited the model family, as far as we could see, all had a very deep interest, and they would definitely have a very deep impression when they returned, and everyone would be happy to use domestic goods! I mean, don't open a domestic goods exhibition in the future! If you want to open one, you should take the three-dimensional and active styles. In other words, you must conduct on-site tests. For example, if the Sanyou Society's free cloth wants to show that it does not fade, it should be hung in the center of the water for everyone to see. The national cloth umbrella should be propped up under the sprinklers, showing its tightness and practicality. This is the most important point.</p>
<p>Secondly, the good impression we had after the visit was that in the speech contest for elementary school students, "The Responsibility of Students to Promote Domestic Goods," even the small minds had a recognition of domestic goods. Jin Jiaomei, a female student from Qingxin School, was very young, but she was able to give a passionate and generous speech on the stage, how to use domestic goods, how to overthrow foreign goods, and save the country. Her eloquence was so good that even adults were ashamed. Such a thought of loving domestic goods, deeply imprinted in the minds of the young masters, will surely be able to recover the lost rights and interests, and domestic goods will always have a way out. I wonder how the modernized grandmothers and wives felt after hearing her speech and blushing?</p>

<h3>Bright Son and Domestic Goods</h3>
<p>— Smoke Shadow</p>
<p>Bright Son is thirteen years old this year, studying in elementary school. He listened to his teachers and parents, knows very well to love the country, and loves to use domestic goods very much. We can take a look at the letters he wrote:</p>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>Brother Zhicheng:</p>
<p>I received your letter yesterday and was very happy. You even sent me two kinds of toys, I am truly grateful!</p>
<p>However, although these two toys are very good and I also love to play with them, I don't think they are domestic goods. I heard people say that there are many people buying these things on the streets recently, they are all foreign goods. I don't know where you bought yours?</p>
<p>Now our domestic goods also have this kind of toy, which is made even more interesting and sturdy than foreign goods. My father once bought one for me to play with. I think we are Chinese citizens and should use Chinese domestic goods, so I don't want what you sent.</p>
<p>I am returning what you sent, and sending you two domestic toys instead. You also heard what my teacher said, we must never buy foreign goods. Please buy more domestic goods in the future, and don't blame me!</p>
<p>School is about to start, how happy! Goodbye! Wishing you</p>
<p>Good health! Brother Bright Son</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>Dear Older Sister:</p>
<p>It has been several months since we parted. We all miss you very much. How is your health?</p>
<p>Yesterday, Second Cousin came to our house. He bought a lot of clothing material, saying that you asked him to buy it. I saw that this kind of clothing material is all foreign goods, and the price is very expensive, several dollars a foot. Alas! I am extremely sad!</p>
<p>Dad often says: "China's poverty and weakness are all because the people don't love the country. Everyone likes to buy foreign goods and give money to foreigners, so our industry is delayed from developing." Haven't you heard what Dad said? You also agreed with it very much, you used to tell me to love the country too, why are you buying foreign goods now?</p>
<p>Not to mention other things, silk is originally a product of our country, and has recently been improved even more. It is said that it is not inferior to foreign goods, but the price is much cheaper. Then we should naturally buy domestic silk to make clothes, don't you think so?</p>
<p>The reason I am writing this letter is to advise you to buy domestic goods for everything in the future. Goodbye! Wishing you</p>
<p>Patriotism! Younger Brother Bright Son</p>
<p>(III)</p>
<p>Dear Second Cousin:</p>
<p>We were very happy when you came to our house the day before yesterday, but it's a pity that you went back so soon.</p>
<p>I admire what you said about buying foreign goods. Alas! Why do our compatriots all like to buy foreign goods? It's really regrettable! You said that the things used in various institutions are almost all foreign goods, is this true? I don't believe it, don't they know how to love the country? Our teacher said that the government is now vigorously promoting domestic goods, but you say that they use a lot of foreign goods, what is the reason for this?</p>
<p>I think there is another kind of people who also buy a lot of foreign goods, and that is women. Look at the clothing material my older sister asked you to buy, the price is expensive, and it's not like there is no domestic silk that can be used to make clothes. Their powder, perfume, all have to be foreign goods, alas! They really have no conscience!</p>
<p>You said that only we elementary school students love the country the most, but we dare not accept that compliment. We just all want to be good citizens, and hope that our four hundred million compatriots will all be of one mind to love the country, and all buy domestic goods with one heart, that would be great! Wishing you</p>
<p>Good health! Cousin Bright Son</p>
<p>Short Story</p>
<h3>The Wedding Night</h3>
<p>— Cold Jade</p>
<p>It was already four o'clock, and the guests who made merry in the bridal chamber had all left. However, everything in the room had a lively atmosphere. After the excitement and noise, the bride and groom were no longer tired. So, the groom suddenly asked:</p>
<p>"Jingyi: I have a question to ask you." The bride was startled and glanced at the groom. The groom continued: "Among the things you bought this time, which country's goods are the most?"</p>
<p>The bride's heart instantly relaxed. After a pause, she replied: "You can rest assured about that. The things I bought this time are all domestic goods."</p>
<p>"Whose idea was it?"</p>
<p>The bride slowly replied: "After the September 18th Incident, I joined the Domestic Goods Ten-Person Group..."</p>
<p>"You also joined the Domestic Goods Ten-Person Group?" The groom asked hastily, "Then we are truly comrades."</p>
<p>The bride continued: "The reason I joined is because I saw that the best way for our people to save the country is to use domestic goods. Only through economic resistance can we truly make the country prosper. Moreover, women in the city should be role models for women across the country, but now they are all using foreign goods. Can this be a role model for the whole country? So I resolutely decided to use domestic goods. After using them, I know that the quality of domestic goods is not worse than that of foreign goods, so why use foreign goods? This is truly a shame for us urban women."</p>
<p>The groom casually picked up a few things on the table to look at, and they were all printed with the trademarks of domestic goods. He was extremely happy and said to the bride: "You are truly the wife of my dreams. Let's make another oath today, we will never use foreign goods."</p>
<p>"We will never use foreign goods."</p>

<h3>Re-election in the Realm of Poetry</h3>
<p>— Smoke Bridge</p>
<p>The poet Mr. Jin Hewang, in previous years, had a playful work on the election of the realm of poetry. At that time, it was still the era of the president, so the characters he chose were:</p>
<p>President: Gu Yanwu Vice President: Qu Dajun</p>
<p>Prime Minister: Zeng Guofan Minister of Interior: Fan Dangshi</p>
<p>Minister of Foreign Affairs: Huang Zunxian Minister of Finance: Fan Zengxiang</p>
<p>Minister of Education: Wang Shizhen Minister of Justice: Shen Deqian</p>
<p>Minister of Transportation: Yuan Mei Minister of Industry: Cheng Jinfang</p>
<p>Minister of the Army: Zhao Wenzhe Minister of the Navy: Qiu Canghai</p>
<p>Of the poets mentioned above, apart from Gu, Qu, Zeng, Huang, Fan, Wang, Shen, and Yuan, everyone knows their life stories. For example, Fan Dangshi, also known as Kentang, was from Tongzhou. His poetry combined the strengths of Su and Huang, and he had a collection of Fan Bozi. Cheng Jinfang, also known as Yumen, with the pen name Jieyuan, was from Shexian, and had the Jieyuan Poetry Collection. Zhao Wenzhe, with the style name Sunzhi, and the pen name Puhan, was from Shanghai, and had the Yatang Collection. During the Qianlong era, he followed Minister Wenfu to quell the Jinchuan rebellion, and died in battle, he was a scholarly warrior. Qiu Canghai was from Taiwan, and died more than ten years ago. The criteria for the election were not only based on their poetry, but also on their scholarship and conduct. Yuan Zicai traveled widely, and was indeed suitable for transportation. Shen Guiyu had a dignified appearance, which was in line with the Ministry of Justice. It can be considered that his reputation matched his position, and he was not unworthy of his duties.</p>
<p>As time passes, talents naturally need to be replaced. Therefore, Mr. Hewang published an announcement in the second issue of the Guoxue Lunheng, published by the Guoxue Society, asking the members to re-elect. The results will be published in the third issue. Those who cling to the past and die in obscurity can breathe a sigh of relief in the netherworld. Moreover, this kind of election is very fair. Those who are alive have no right to be elected. Poetry ghosts will not be able to campaign. Even if there is a wisp of a poetic soul to guide the pen, the electors can still act with integrity and not cater to anyone's preferences.</p>
<p>This kind of game has been around for a long time among literati. For example, Lu Juren's Jiangxi School Chart was the originator. In the mid-Qing Dynasty, Shu Wei had the Qianlong Jia Poetry Scene Commanders' Record, which compared poets to heroes of Liangshan Marsh. Although the comparison was not perfect, it was still stubborn and pleasing. It is a pity that there were too many positions, which inevitably led to excessiveness. In my opinion, it is necessary to conform to the modern system, and below the chairman, set up departments and divisions, so that the origins and schools can be more easily traced.</p>
<h3>Edward Road More Than Twenty Years Ago</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>The situation in Shanghai is truly changing every five years and transforming drastically every decade. No matter how old you are in Shanghai, as long as you leave for a few years, you will be somewhat dazed and confused, unable to recognize which is Nanjing Road and which is Fuzhou Road. All you see are towering buildings, magnificent mansions, and neon lights everywhere, a scene of prosperity that stirs the heart and mind. I once heard my late grandfather, Mr. Jinting, talk about when he first arrived in Shanghai, the area north of Nanjing Road was completely barren, full of graves and cemeteries. Fujian Road was still a river, with wild boats moored randomly, full of rural scenery. Today, it has transformed into a bustling urban area with dense population and endless traffic. It was definitely beyond his wildest dreams back then.</p>
<p>I was born late, so of course I didn't see the earliest Shanghai. However, I still remember the situation of Edward Road more than twenty years ago. At that time, my late grandfather was still alive and well. We had properties in both Shanghai and Suzhou. I lived in Shanghai and studied at the Duren School along the city wall. Every day on my way to school, I had to pass through Edward Road. At that time, Edward Road was a foreign creek, serving as the natural boundary between the British and French concessions. Bridges were built over the creek for people to pass back and forth, which is why there are still names like Dai Gou Bridge, Zhengjia Wooden Bridge, and Dongxin Bridge to this day. The north bank of the creek was the British concession, and the embankment was built relatively well. However, the south bank of the creek, which was the French concession, was dilapidated and overgrown with weeds. Crabs grew in the gaps in the mud on the embankment. Every day after school, I often climbed onto the dilapidated embankment with a few mischievous classmates to catch crabs. Although the crabs were small, their claws were very sharp. If we weren't careful, we would bleed our fingers. However, due to our naughty nature, we didn't care about the pain and caught as many as we could, putting them in the largest cigarette box, which was completely filled. We also used a tin biscuit box, accumulating wet clay inside, digging holes so that the crabs could enter and exit, and giving them some food. In this way, the crabs' lives were extended for a few days. The childhood scene is still vivid in my memory, just like yesterday. Now, Edward Road has become the widest thoroughfare in all of Shanghai, with high buildings on both sides and densely packed shops. When it's time for office workers to go to and from work, the motorcycles speed by like lightning, one after another. The traces of the old days are nowhere to be found. If I were to talk about catching crabs there now, wouldn't it become a joke?</p>
<h3>Lamenting General Autumn</h3>
<p>— Lean Qing</p>
<p>Crickets, small autumn insects, and people like to pit them against each other in fights, competing for victory, and even spending thousands of dollars without hesitation. Then, these people naturally value crickets almost more than the outstanding heroes and strongmen among humans. The other night, the local police cracked down on a cricket fighting venue, and more than seventy famous people were arrested and taken to the police station. Apart from those who were released on bail for several hundred dollars at the time, the others are still being held. Later, they were taken to the Special District Local Court, where fines were imposed with varying amounts. The cricket breeders, although fined, don't consider it a big deal. However, many "Generals" (people here call crickets by this title) were trampled on by them at the time, their pots and jars were broken, their heads and feet were incomplete, and they died suddenly on the spot. This is truly the most regrettable and hateful thing. A friend sent me a "funeral notice" the other day. I couldn't help but laugh when I saw it. This "funeral notice" was actually for a cricket's funeral. So, the "funeral notice" said:</p>
<p>Condolences, General Bai Qingqiu, passed away in our bedroom due to illness at the hour of Wei (1-3 PM) on November 22nd of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, having been acquired on the Shen (3-5 PM) of the third day before the Mid-Autumn Festival of the lunar calendar, at the age of fifty days. A grave will be dug on December 20th and buried in the western part of our garden, with an inscription that reads "The Tomb of General Bai Qingqiu." Those who have an affinity for autumn, please accept this announcement!</p>
<p>This friend can be considered extremely humorous. He also attached a personal letter, explaining: "This General was bought from Hangzhou for 340 silver dollars at the time. He has fought three times and can be called an invincible, ever-victorious General. Unexpectedly, he suffered this misfortune this time. Although he was not guilty of fighting and was able to return from danger, he has been experiencing constant changes in temperature in recent days, and his care was inadequate. When I looked at him this morning, he was already stiff. Alas, alas!" After reading the words in the letter, I couldn't help but laugh, but I also had to write a few words of mourning and follow the usual social customs to respond to my friend. So I picked up my pen and wrote a lament to mourn him, and sent it to my friend:</p>
<p>Alas, you little autumn insect, why couldn't you rest quietly? Your chattering chirping annoyed the playful children. In the end, amidst the broken walls and broken houses, you destroyed your home. You couldn't lie low and leisurely, and instead entered the cage. Elegant people named it Autumn Interest, and all claimed to be followers of Jia Sidao. Who would have thought that your white teeth and green scales (i.e., the General's special features) and your coir raincoat, golden belt, moon forehead, and delicate features (other Generals' advantages) were irrelevant. In defeat, you would collapse and retreat in a panic, but in victory, you would plant a red flag and turn it red in an instant. However, at the time of engagement, you had no autonomy, and were entirely at the mercy of people's instigation and manipulation. Alas, so much gold was spent on your one beak, and your loyalty was in vain, and people's pockets were emptied. What's more, it was like gambling and arresting generals in the official's quarters, which is not allowed by law, and fines were imposed. This is no different from today's warlords who willingly become leaders of the army. Although they occupy territory and call themselves heroes, they ultimately become a laughingstock and sacrifice themselves in vain. Why bother to unleash your power and recklessly do something beyond your ability? I mourn the General's flapping wings and bared fangs, and his misfortune. I have no choice but to offer these words to awaken those who are dreaming.</p>
<h3>Talking About Year-End Reports</h3>
<p>— New</p>
<p>Every year during the New Year in the solar or lunar calendar, because major newspapers suspend publication, people who seek to make a quick buck by publishing year-end reports emerge, hoping to earn some extra income. Three years ago, major newspapers suspended publication for as many as nine days, which was indeed a large influx of money, so there were as many as twenty or more kinds of year-end reports. Their sales ranged from hundreds to thousands of copies. However, the fewer the sales, the more income they received. The amount of advertising they pulled in depended on their individual efforts, which was their income. Now, in order to compete, major newspapers suspend publication for three days from New Year's Day, but during these three days, they issue extra editions, accept all advertising, and notify all movie theaters and shops in advance. As a result, the year-end reports of those who seek to make a quick buck are like a bolt from the blue, receiving a death sentence. Therefore, there are not a few who cancel their plans temporarily. This can be considered their most disappointing thing.</p>
<h3>Northeast Four Company Commanders</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 20: Predicting Good Fortune, the Old Man Smiles Daily; Dispelling Endless Worries, Old Friends Live Across the Street</p>
<p>When Guizhi turned her head, it was Aunt Liu, the newly arrived maid of the Gan family. She didn't know about Guizhi's past dealings with the Gan family, so she replied: "She's been lying at home these past few days. She only got a little better today." Aunt Liu said: "Isn't that right? Now there's another seasonal illness. Our master is very ill, and all the relatives in the city have come to see him." Guizhi asked: "What kind of illness is it that's so serious? Has your Second Master come too?" Aunt Liu said: "He's been here for several days. He's been taking care of most of the patient's affairs. He also asked me about it..." Saying this, she glanced at Guizhi and smiled slightly. Guizhi pretended not to care and casually asked: "What did he ask about?" Aunt Liu smiled: "He asked when you were getting married. He said he has a very good relationship with your company commander and is prepared to give a generous gift." Guizhi blushed and smiled: "I think you're making that up. Why would he ask about my whereabouts?" Aunt Liu said: "I'm really telling the truth. You'll understand when you meet him another day." Guizhi felt an infinite amount of emotion when she heard these words. She stood there stunned, holding the small package in her hand. Aunt Liu didn't want to say more to her and turned around to leave. Guizhi stood there for a while. When she looked up, Aunt Liu had already walked away. She thought that it would be boring to just stand there, so she took the package and went to Wang the tailor's house. About an hour later, she walked back to the original place. When she reached the entrance of the Gan family, she stretched her head and looked into their courtyard to see if there was anything else going on. Just as she was looking, Gan Jizhi was walking from east to west in the courtyard. He didn't expect anyone to be peeking at him outside the gate, so he looked ahead and didn't see Guizhi. However, Guizhi's heart skipped a beat, and she couldn't help but shrink back. By the time Jizhi had walked past, she pretended to have lost something and kept pacing around in the alley, but constantly stealing glances inside the gate. After pacing for a long time, Jizhi was finally unable to come out again, so she had no choice but to lower her head and slowly walk home. (273)</p>

<h3>Shanghai Flower Shops</h3>
<p>— Chen Bijun</p>
<p>Flowers can cultivate temperament, flowers can delight the mood. We often like to stop and gaze when passing by flower shops, appreciating them. The magic of flowers is indeed not small. In recent years, new methods of cultivation have become popular, and the cultivation of flowers has been promoted. Flower shops are opening up more and more, which is also a kind of emerging industry.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, flower shops are mostly concentrated in the areas of Sichuan Road, Xiejiao General Assembly, and Avenue Joffre. Under the bright glass windows, there are exquisitely crafted flower baskets, and around them are red, green, and five-colored flowers and leaves. Occasionally stepping inside is like being in a fragrant kingdom, surrounded by green and red. It is said that the arrangement of flower shop windows is best in the western district. Affluent families also attach neon lights to the glass windows. When the night market arrives, the lights are bright and illuminating, enveloping the delicate flower branches, making them look even more energetic. The skills of making flower baskets are unmatched in the old Qichang area of Sichuan Road. Its products have uniform colors, are well-spaced, and have artistic ideas. In the last flower arrangement competition, a shop there won the first prize.</p>
<p>There is a flower market in the Nanyang Bridge area of Ximen. At dawn, various flowers gather in one place, with all kinds of colors and shapes. Flower shop owners all go there to purchase. Some flower shop owners cultivate flowers on their own land in the suburbs and sell their own products. In short, the flowers in the market are piled up like mountains, at everyone's disposal, and are not worthy of cherishing. Once they arrive at the flower shop, they are cherished, like a country girl who has entered the city, lightly touching up her eyebrows and wearing silk and satin, immediately becoming ten times more valuable. High-quality flowers are calculated by the bloom or bunch. The value of selling flower baskets and wreaths is at least two yuan each, and more can cost tens or even hundreds of yuan. Chinese people often like mixed colors, while Westerners prefer simplicity.</p>
<p>Flower shops opened by Chinese people mostly sell loose fresh flowers, with elaborate flower baskets and wreaths as the main business. Occasionally, they also arrange halls and wrap colored plaques for people. Japanese flower shops also sell bonsai rockeries and goldfish and birds, etc. Their store names seem to be more elegant, unlike ours, which are specially named with words such as "getting rich" and "smooth sailing." After looking at more than a hundred flower shops run by Chinese people, the signboards of Luchun in Xiejiao and Huandie Flower Shop in Guibal Road are among the best.</p>
<p>The improvement of customs cannot be regarded as the evolution of the city. The old陋习 of the past are gradually being eliminated now. Wreaths are sent for condolences, and flower baskets are used for weddings, birthdays, send-offs, and捧角. Even when visiting patients, a bunch of fresh flowers is sent to give them some sweet comfort in their painful environment. I remember when the League of Nations Manchuria Investigation Team passed through Tokyo, beautiful women sent flowers. This probably carried some媚意 in addition to respect.</p>
<p>The most prosperous seasons for flowers are late spring and summer, and the prices are also the cheapest. But康耐馨 are available in all seasons. Its colors are divided into three types: bright red, pink, and light white. Westerners love it the most, and they don't hesitate to spend one dollar to buy twelve blooms when it's expensive. Now that chrysanthemums have withered, flower shops still rely on it to struggle. The rest, yellow, white, and red monthly roses, and some ivory red, and year-round green mountain grasses, are lined up colorfully. The most fashionable are narcissus and white茨菇 flowers. Gladiolus and dahlias are inherently fertile. Dahlias have now disappeared, and gladiolus bloom in spring and summer. Recently, our country has often used to delay its planting period and extend it, so that it can be sold for a long time. It is a bulb, shaped like a chestnut, and its color is very diverse, the most common being light yellow. It has a thin membrane on the outside and has considerable resistance to the harsh winter. All year round, there are mostly洋花, and only 30% of flowers are本土.</p>
<p>I love to insert some fresh flowers in my desk and my bedroom. When the long night is漫漫 and the atmosphere is lonely, under the quiet lamplight or in the oblique moonlight, facing the flower color and feeling the flower fragrance, the漂泊人生 will get infinite comfort. It's a pity that after some time, the petals withered and the leaves withered. It was ignored by people and finally abandoned. Alas! The beauty of the past only leaves some melancholy in my heart, but the dreams of the young people have disappeared with the passing of time, and what is left is nothing more than some scars that are not easy to磨损.</p>

<h3>Financial and Gold Market Situation Stable</h3>
<p>American Bank and Exchange Rate Retreat</p>
<p>Recovers to Three Yuan, One Dime</p>
<p>The gold market yesterday slightly rebounded. The situation in the morning was stable, and people's hearts were also settled. The market within the exchange seemed somewhat confused, but as banks still had a strong appetite, generally hedgers were more inclined to buy, and there was more struggling. However, it consistently hovered within the 700-yuan range. Initially in the morning, overseas silver markets were stable in Britain but retreated in America. The forward silver price at the Precious Metals Exchange decreased by nine hao to one li and a half. London spot gold and the American official gold buying price both remained unchanged. American cotton rose by five pound sounds, American wheat shrank by eight seven five, and stock prices showed only minor fluctuations. The wool market opened and immediately rose to ninety-seven or eight yuan. After opening, as the exchange rate became tighter, HSBC's listed rates were stable for the British Pound but showed an American retreat of two five, and people's hearts became firmer and higher. However, as there was a considerable supply taking advantage of the high prices, it was difficult to rise further and it just hovered. Subsequently, the internal market slightly hardened and retreated as the banks' absorption once slightly lagged. It remained stable at noon. Although Reuters telegrams during the morning mentioned that the French government had achieved victory in the parliament, it had no impact. The spot price was 1,080 yuan, and the swap spread was 9.1 yuan. The market situation for this morning is recorded below.</p>

As a result, it recovered by 3.1 yuan compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The indicated price was 30.25 yuan due to HSBC bank’s American Dollar listing shrinking by two five, implying a benchmark gold price of 721 yuan even.

The ledger price for the current month was 713 yuan, 707 yuan for January, and 698 yuan for February. The morning supplementary payment was 713 yuan. The spot price was 1,080 yuan.

<h3>Financial Markets Extremely Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silver and money industries were quiet due to the approaching end of the year. The interbank rate for both Chinese and foreign banks remained unchanged, with the morning and noon rates both at seven percent.

<h3>Jiangsu Small Foreign Coins Rose Early, Fell at Noon</h3>

The volume of transactions was 11,500 jiao in the early market and 6,500 jiao in the noon market. Guangdong small foreign coins were 797.2 jiao in the early and noon markets, and 797.6 jiao in the noon market, with a change of four jiao between the two markets.

Copper coins shrank again by 2,000 wen to 288,000 wen, with 32,656 strings traded, equivalent to 11,200 yuan in foreign currency.</p>
<h3>Securities and Public Bonds Near Low, Far High</h3>
<p>Because the Later Market Requires Two Sessions</p>
<p>No Transactions Occurred Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Securities Exchange, a dispute between an agent and the exchange over afternoon one-session and two-session trading lasted for a long time, resulting in no market at all in the afternoon. This phenomenon is unfortunate. The exchange has been extending the daily three-session trading for many days, resulting in significant losses. Temporary adaptations may be possible once or twice due to excessive trading volume. Yesterday, the opening was held at 3:00 PM, and there was no reason to accommodate it further, resulting in no transactions at all in the afternoon, even though the session was held as usual. Regarding market prices, even though only two sessions were held in the morning, the trend became strong. The situation remained gloomy, and based on Li Bai's efforts to retain the four representatives, the feelings between the two sides could be considered harmonious. The situation in Fujian and Zhejiang remained a stalemate, and no war was expected to break out in the short term. Market rumors were not credible. Large investors bought in during the morning opening, and short sellers also rolled over, causing prices to rise unanimously by four jiao to one yuan. The trend was very firm. In the second session, military reorganization continued to be strong, rising another three jiao and a half to five jiao and a half. Military bonds initially sold at half a yuan, but gradually fell due to long-term rollover. Market sentiment was slightly skeptical, and there was some selling, but it was mostly retail investors. The trend was near low, far high, which was clearly a long-term rollover. Later, because short sellers also rolled over and there was a need for the 21st issue, it gradually stabilized, so the second session was mostly slightly smaller by three or four jiao. Although the afternoon session opened as usual, it was delayed until after 6:00 PM due to the above reasons and ended without results. Market prices all rose, ranging from two or three jiao to six or seven jiao. The total transaction volume was estimated at around 10 million yuan based on the two morning sessions.</p>
<h3>New York Stock Market Stagnant and Weary</h3>
<p>Xin Feng Foreign Firm reported that the New York stock market on the 19th was mixed and stagnant, a common phenomenon before holidays. However, some stocks, such as the Preferred Stock of Restructuring the Empire and the Preferred Stock of Gotham Silk Factory, plummeted by 17 yuan and 6 yuan, respectively, for unknown reasons. Atlas Thach gradually calmed down due to the upcoming inspection. Steel stocks rose due to good news, while bonds were sluggish. The daily trading volume was 1,020,000 shares. Wheat news was uneventful, and it was advisable to buy when it fell. Cotton was not expected to have significant ups and downs before the holiday. According to the report, the government will purchase a large amount of cotton. The price of gold purchased by the Financial Relief Agency was 34.06 yuan per tael and remained unchanged. The Dow Jones Index is listed below.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Market Stagnant and Bleak</h3>
<p>The yarn market remains bleak, and the inactivity is necessary due to the poor environment. Dealers are all halting purchases of spot goods because of weak finance and a decline in high-end business. Coupled with the approaching end of the year, the market is even more difficult to improve.</p>
<h3>Man-Made Cotton Quietly Firm</h3>
<p>The morning market for man-made cotton opened with a slight improvement in sentiment due to the small rise in American cotton. Prices for each month rose by one or two jiao. In the afternoon, it was heard that the sales of spot yarn were very sluggish, and the market situation was flat. Prices for each month rose by one or two jiao. The total transaction volume for the day was estimated at 5,000 bales. It was found that Geng Feng sold 450 bales, Tong Kee 500 bales, Jin Chang 400 bales, and Xin Cheng 400 bales. Da Feng bought 350 bales, Ming De 500 bales, Chang Feng 450 bales, and Tong He 300 bales. The closing prices are as follows:</p>

<p>Swatow 5 Inland 148 Ningbo 17</p>
<p>Trade 25 Wuhu 10 Nanjing 7</p>
<h3>This Month's Cotton Seems to Have a Short Squeeze</h3>
<p>The cotton market has been trending upward this month because it is said that Puyi Factory is collecting goods for a short squeeze. Therefore, while the yarn market is falling, cotton is rising instead. It was found that the price for this month is slightly higher than the spot cotton price, which is entirely due to short covering. Buyers for this month are preparing to collect 20,000 dan, and the inspection office already has more than 10,000 dan. Based on the overall trend, it is feared that there will not be a large increase in price. The National Government's American cotton is being sold in the market at a 30% discount to the market price. However, the factories have no way to sell their yarn and have no intention of accepting.</p>
<h3>Zheng Standard Rose Two Jiao</h3>
<p>The Zheng Standard opened in the early market, with few sellers in the market. Prices for each month rose by 1.5 jiao. In the afternoon, it rose another 0.5 to 1 jiao. The total transaction volume for the day was estimated at 44,300 dan. It was found that Sui Long sold 3,000 dan, Xin Heng 1,200 dan, Yuan Da 4,000 dan, Rui Da 1,000 dan, Sen Kang 1,000 dan, Heng Chang 1,300 dan, and Xin Cheng 1,100 dan. Ji Feng bought 2,100 dan, Chang Ji 1,300 dan, Jin Chang 1,300 dan, Yuan Da 2,400 dan, Chang Feng 3,800 dan, Tong Xing 2,200 dan, and Yuan Xing Chang 1,300 dan. The closing prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Zheng Standard Closing Price Increase/Decrease Account Balance Zheng Standard Closing Price Increase/Decrease Account Balance</p>

<h3>Factory Demand Still Flat and Stagnant</h3>

<h3>American Cotton Had a Short Covering Rebound</h3>
<p>Other Cotton Prices All Fell</p>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market was stagnant and unremarkable. Dealers adopted a wait-and-see attitude. It first fell due to profit-taking by long positions and then rebounded firmly due to short covering. As a result, spot prices rose by 10 pound sounds, and futures prices rose by 5 to 13 pound sounds. Liverpool spot cotton fell by 3 points, and futures fell by 12 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 3 points. The Bombay cotton market was quiet and unremarkable. As a result, Bengal fell by 2.5 rupees, Oomra fell by 1.25 rupees, and Broach fell by 0.75 rupees. The original telegram is recorded to the left (telegram of the 19th).</p>
<p>American Cotton Compared to Previous Day Equivalent in National Currency British Cotton Compared to Previous Day Equivalent in National Currency</p>

<h3>Grain and Flour Markets Hovered with Softness</h3>
<p>After the flour market opened in the morning, each month presented an initially flat and then stable appearance. As the quoted price of foreign wheat was slightly lower in Chicago and slightly higher in Canada, the market was stable after the opening. Later, as each factory disposed of goods, all observed the market. Market chips seemed to be lacking, so the market atmosphere for each month recovered by a small amount. When the market opened in the afternoon, sentiment was briefly favorable, but because there was much speculation outside the industry and some customer groups slightly collected, the near term was slightly better than the morning. The far term, however, was weak due to the increasingly unfavorable atmosphere of foreign wheat. After the fourth session, the near term was very smooth due to the active return of long positions, and the market atmosphere also greatly loosened. Although spot foreign wheat was not being sold, there was still a loose trend in the market, so buying sentiment was greatly affected. As a result, this month only improved by 0.05, January fell by 0.075, February fell by 0.025, March fell by 0.075, April fell by 0.05, and May fell by 0.075.</p>
<p>After the wheat market opened in the morning and afternoon, each month presented a near-term falling and far-term stable appearance. Because this month was the last trading day, it initially opened at 1.3 jiao in the morning, but later, the actual chips were said to be 70 to 80 carloads, and some powerless long positions returned one after another, causing the market to fall step by step. At closing, it fell to 4.03 yuan, a sharp drop of 1 jiao compared to the initial opening. When the market opened in the afternoon, this month recovered by 0.3 to 0.5 jiao compared to the morning because traders prepared to collect and short positions covered. Transactions for far-term months were always quiet, with little fluctuation. As a result, this month fell by 0.06 compared to the previous day, January fell by 0.01, February rose by 0.01, and the rest remained unchanged. Spot wheat sales were still low, and prices fell by about 1 jiao. 500 bags of Shandong wheat were opened at 4.1 yuan and were handled by Huafeng.</p>
<h3>Cloudy Rice Rises, High-Quality Goods Rise by About One Jiao</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were more than 50 suppliers (more than 7,000 shi), including 10 to 20 suppliers of late rice. The market saw a sudden weakening of purchases, so the situation was quite clear. Fortunately, the arrival of goods was relatively rare, and sellers tightened their grip on the market to the greatest extent, so the market was able to stabilize. A total of more than 1,000 bags were sold, all of which were goods from Qingjiao, Songjiang, and Sijing. Those from central districts such as Xilian were all purchased by other buyers because current buyers did not take action. Although the local shops were not inferior, it was difficult to stabilize sentiment, so the market was flat. Generally, thick japonica rice from Nangang was not very popular, and prices only rose slightly. Du Yangjian's rice was slightly tighter. There was some activity among cloudy rice yuan wine shops and retailers. High-quality goods have risen by about one jiao, and those from central districts have also risen by a few points.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were more than 30 suppliers from various riverbank districts. The purchases of various goods in the market were normal. The early market for white japonica rice was tight, but the market relaxed in the afternoon. Various types of rice such as tip rice, altered rice, and early thin rice were all firm.</p>
<h3>Ke Xian and Min Sales Revive Again</h3>
<p>Arrivals Are Continuous, Prices Rise Slightly</p>
<p>Yesterday's Ke Xian rice market saw a price increase due to strong sales at the beginning of the month. Arrivals from various regions have been arriving in Shanghai successively, and the number of those not yet arrived is also large. Therefore, sentiment has been weakened again, and traders are also seeking to sell off. The market shape was very soft in the morning, with all types of rice returning by three or five points, or nearly one jiao. Those with higher prices could still stabilize. However, the Fuzhou group originally had a strong appetite, but now that market prices have fallen flat, they are taking advantage of the small purchases and packing. The whole city sold 95 bags of unpolished rice from Fuzhou, 432 bags of unpolished rice from Shashi, 197 bags of unpolished rice from Nanjing, and 197 bags of Liu Xian rice. The Ningbo group only handled 100 bags of Yuan rice from Wuhu. The local shops handled 91 bags of Yuan rice from Jiangxi and 320 bags of Jing rice from Hunan. Currently, the market has no good prospects considering the sufficient supply and inventory. If sales to the southern provinces become stronger again and local hoarders continue to handle the rice, there may be a chance for a turnaround.</p>
<h3>Peanuts Sell Well, Peanut Kernels Don't Move</h3>
<p>Peanuts: Since their launch, their market has undergone changes, but sales in various locations have been continuous. Prices are more stable than peanut kernels. Yesterday, more than 1,000 bags of Tancheng goods were opened, with prices ranging from 4.9 yuan to 4.7 yuan. Apart from the Ningbo group taking 50 bags, the rest were handled by the local shops.</p>
<p>Peanut Kernels: The market is still not active. Exports are not moving, and factories and local shops are asking for information. No quotations were made yesterday. Although the source is small, there are approximately 50,000 to 60,000 bags of inventory. If there were more than 200,000 bags of inventory at this time in previous years, sentiment would still be flat. However, in this sluggish situation, there are 20,000 to 30,000 bags of inventory, so sentiment is nervous.</p>
<h3>Southern and Northern Goods: New Large-Grained Longans Have Already Been Opened</h3>
<p>The new large-grained longans from the second and third batches have not been opened for a long time because the cost is high and they do not fit the sales appetite. Now that goods are gradually becoming scarce and no new goods are continuing to arrive, the sellers' intentions are slightly active. Yesterday, it was heard that the shops had already sold one to two hundred boxes, with prices lower than the highest price by seven to eight yuan each. Although they are losing money, the sales channel is still small, and it is feared that the market will be difficult to recover.</p>

<h3>Various Kinds of Foreign Locks</h3>
<p>Locks are needed for doors and equipment, and with the progress of machinery, Chinese-made locks are even considered to have simple structures and are almost extinct in urban areas. Locks shipped from the UK, US, Japan, and Germany, regardless of quality, have surprisingly gained a large sales volume, and these are commonly referred to as foreign locks.</p>
<p>The buying and selling of locks is calculated according to "gross" (one gross is ten dozen). The locks that are popular on the market are (1) square locks, which are commonly used, with the 808 and 710 models being the most common, and each model has different sizes; (2) insert locks, where the lock ball portion is matched with metal and enamel silver metal; (3) spring door locks, commonly known as spring locks, which have many distinctions, and the numbers are 3517, 2300, 2100, 2400, 2500, 4204, 4207, 1504, 6066, 111, 7140, etc.; (4) round locks, which come in sizes 16, 18, 19, and 21; (5) crescent locks, which are shaped like a crescent moon and come in six types, 15, 25, 35, 45, 55, and 65, and are distinguished by the size of the case; (6) white-covered locks, named because the lock body is covered with bright white metal, and the size is indicated by millimeter numbers on the lock body, such as 15, 25, 35, 45, 55, 65, and other sizes; (7) black locks and cupronickel-covered locks, with black and cupronickel coverings on the lock body, similar to spring and white-covered locks; (8) silver-plated locks, named because they are plated with silver, with sizes of 25, 35, 45, and 55; (9) brass locks, made of brass, with sizes of 25, 35, 45, and 55; (10) triangular locks, which are triangular, double-opening locks that can be opened on both sides, color locks, with various colors in the middle of the lock body, white lead locks, which are white lead gray, etc. Other lever-type, cylinder-type, and compass-type locks, with added triggers and hands, can be selected by those who need them.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Xin Chao Qing Falls Another 4 Jiao</h3>
<p>Yesterday the sugar market trend was relatively stable, and transactions were more active. The guild set the price for 24 coarse granulated white common goods at 19.75 yuan, down by 0.02, and about 600 bags were traded. Transshipment of Zi Jiao goods was 6.9 yuan, but the original price was not reached. The price of 20 medium granulated white common goods was 19.35 yuan, and the price of 89 grade He Chi SR goods was 15.8 yuan. The price of transshipped high-quality goods was 7.05 yuan. The price of Taikoo Sugar B mark was 20.25 yuan, unchanged, and the CW mark was down 0.02 to 20.008 yuan. The price of Xin Chao Qing brand fell another 0.4 jiao, and more than 300 bags were opened, with the price of Ti Zhuang Qing being 14 yuan, followed by 13.8 yuan to 13.5 yuan. The price of Zhen Ji Mian Bai No. 1 was 18.9 yuan, but no transactions were made.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: No Sales Inside or Outside the Silk Market</h3>
<p>▲Zhejiang Silk Industry Accumulates Cocoons, Difficult to Sell</p>
<p>Although there are more than twenty silk filatures in Hangzhou, Shaoxing, Huzhou, and Jiaxing in Zhejiang Province, only about four out of ten have managed to start work this autumn. Currently, only two or three are rushing to reel the remaining cocoons in preparation for closing down. However, the various manufacturers have a total of 15,000 piculs of unsold dry cocoons from the spring and autumn seasons, which can supply silk filatures with 2,700 to 2,800 piculs of silk. Among them, the Model Silk Filature and others have the largest stockpiles of cocoons. Sichuan and Hubei coarse silks are not selling well, with thick stocks in Shanghai and few new sources. A few days ago, the Jiangshun and other ships brought 38 pieces of Mianzhou and Mianyang yellow coarse silk, which were distributed to the Chunbao, Taihe, and other silk firms. As for the overseas market, Japanese silk prices have depreciated, and sales efforts are increasing. The various silk weaving factories cannot afford Chinese silk due to its high price. European and American silk sales still show no signs of improvement. The domestic silk shops also have no desire to purchase, as the end of the year is approaching. The market atmosphere is stagnant, and there is little market activity to report.</p>
<h3>Imports of Artificial Silk Decrease Year by Year</h3>
<p>丨Recent Transactions Also Sluggish丨</p>
<p>In recent years, the sales of artificial silk have replaced natural silk, resulting in annual imports consistently exceeding 10 million taels. According to customs reports, import statistics for the last four years show a gradual decrease. The reasons are the daily decline in the price of raw silk and the increase in import tariffs on artificial silk. Among the importing countries, Italy ranks first, followed by Germany and Japan. In 1930, the total imports were 127,091 piculs, with a value of 15,279,857 taels. In 1931, the imports were 123,349 piculs, with a value of 19,059,675 taels. In 1932, the imports were 103,388 piculs, with a value of 11,404,630 taels. From January to June of this year, the imports were 46,234 piculs, with a value of 4,289,878 taels. Recently, as the end of the year approaches, the demand for artificial silk has further decreased. Yesterday, only Meiya and other factories imported 20 cases of Golden Unicorn and Black Beauty brands, priced at 179.75 yuan net per package.</p>

<h3>On Grand Funerals</h3>
<p>— Yao Ke</p>
<p>The paraphernalia of grand funerals in China varies slightly from place to place; for example, the South has "path-opening gods," while the North has "snow willows"; but they are all pleasing to the eye and lively.</p>
<p>The most interesting thing about grand funerals is the tripartite system of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism. The spirit tablet in the soul cart is a symbol of Confucianism; the monks and Taoists interspersed in the procession represent the authority of Buddhism and Taoism. The Chinese are thoroughly clever, incorporating all three teachings; the soul of the deceased either becomes a saint, a Buddha, or an immortal, like playing a thirty-six-door lottery, where at least one door will hit.</p>
<p>Foreigners, on the other hand, are foolish. They all worship the same God, but they insist on dividing into Catholicism, Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and other sects. The followers of each sect are as incompatible as birds' eyes and chickens, not understanding harmony, incorporation, or the wonderful method of playing a thirty-six-door lottery. Therefore, the souls of foreigners face the danger of making a single, all-or-nothing bet; if they miss, they will fall into the eighteenth level of Avici Hell, never to be redeemed.</p>
<p>The porters carrying flags and umbrellas in grand funerals are also intriguing. They are what Shanghainese call "despicable fellows," usually disheveled and dirty; the clothes they wear are not only dirty enough to "disgrace the nation," but also tattered enough to "offend public morals." But during grand funerals, they wear red-tasseled hats and embroidered robes, dignified and imposing, although their feet are still muddy under the robes.</p>
<p>The most important thing in a grand funeral seems to be the deceased in the coffin. The preciousness of the coffin and the extravagance of the burial goods are self-evident; just the pomp of the dragon-lai phoenix-tail crane-top, with its sixty-four bearers, is enough to see. But although the deceased in the coffin gets all the attention, it is actually just a front; the filial sons who have "extended the calamity to their late father" in the memorial announcements are the main characters of the grand funeral. The burly bodyguards only protect the filial sons, not the deceased, and the entire procession is just to enhance the prestige of the filial sons, not for the sake of the deceased's dignity!</p>
<p>Although the filial sons say "in mourning attire, confused and dazed," and "weeping blood and kowtowing" in the obituary, in fact, they are not confused at all during the grand funeral, and there may not be any real tears. The filial sons who owe a "mourning robe debt" are undoubtedly overjoyed in the memorial announcements. Even those who do not owe a mourning robe debt are preoccupied with the important matter of hiring lawyers to fight over the inheritance, so how could they keep the "late father's" will in mind? Even if the inheritance has already been divided and settled, they still need to plan to build new Western-style buildings and marry concubines...</p>
<p>The filial sons enjoy the inheritance, and it is indeed unspeakably delightful; the family's accountants, bodyguards, servants, and even the general attendants, monks, Taoists, drummers, bands, idlers, and the "despicable fellows" carrying flags and umbrellas also get some kickbacks, and everyone is happy.</p>
<p>As for the people watching the funeral procession, although they feast their eyes, they inevitably suffer some hardships. Losing shoes and hats and having their bags snatched are minor matters; if, unfortunately, there is a tragedy such as pregnant women being trampled or children getting lost, they can only "swallow their knocked-out teeth into their stomachs."</p>
<p>Some say: it would be best if there were no idle people watching the funeral procession, so that there would be no tragedies. That is true, but if no one is watching, there would be no grand funeral.</p>
<h3>Meat and the Whip</h3>
<p>— Ma Guoliang</p>
<p>When watching the performance of the Haijingbo Circus, I seemed to have a somewhat inexplicable feeling. Recently, I inadvertently saw the scene of them training wild animals in a movie, and I suddenly understood. Now I will roughly record it.</p>
<p>The curtain opens: the words "Animals in School" are written, and the words "Haijingbo's Method of Training Animals" are written.</p>
<p>F. I. Haijingbo stands outside the tiger cage and says a lot to the audience. Some of the words were unclear, and some were unclear. However, the general idea is nothing more than saying that training wild animals requires a lot of hard work and patience, etc. Then he began to show the training methods...</p>
<p>Watching a play is not like listening to words (and foreign words), so I saw it very clearly. But my memory is just as bad, and in many places, although I saw it clearly, I also made the mistake of not remembering clearly. But one thing that I will never forget now or in the future is: the trainer never lets go of the piece of meat and the whip!</p>
<p>The white-clad female trainer puts a piece of meat on a stool. There is another stool more than ten feet away from this stool, with a tiger standing on it. Then the female technician took a large ring between the two stools, on the one hand letting the tiger see the piece of meat, and on the other hand, the whip was shaking, so the tiger, which the world calls male and fierce, also lowered its ears and jumped through the ring, leaping to a stool on the opposite side and grabbing the piece of meat into its mouth. This is the training method for tigers to jump through rings.</p>
<p>Another set, tying the meat with a string, like fishing towards the dog's mouth. Holding the meat in the left hand and the whip in the right hand, the dog stands up like a human and can even dance.</p>
<p>Another set of cats climbing ladders, bears riding bicycles... Naturally, the meat bait and the whip are always together. Although some places are not shown on the movie screen, from the beginning to the success of the training, would you say that he did not use these two magic weapons?</p>
<p>After the piece of meat comes the whip, and after the whip comes the piece of meat, and there is a gentle embrace, so the tiger also piles up the Arhats, the monkey can also dance, and the fox can also practice boxing!</p>
<p>A gentleman sitting behind me couldn't help but marvel at his companion, saying that Haijingbo's methods were brilliant, but also lamented the weakness of the tiger.</p>
<p>I don't know why, but I think this person is really stupid. I wanted to tell him that what Haijingbo used was not some amazing smart method. This is just an old method. From a long time ago until now, many people have been using it, and it is as effective as Haijingbo's. I also wanted to tell him to hurry home and take a look in the mirror to see if he looked a bit like the face of that tiger or the head of that dog.</p>
<p>Of course, this was just a thought in my heart and I didn't really say it to him. I was afraid that when he asked me to look in the mirror too, I really wouldn't have the courage to take a mirror!</p>
<p>Suddenly, I thought of "Island of Lost Souls" again. I thought of the group of beasts who had been tortured and made into human form, and used as slaves, and finally realized that their master would die just like them, and finally killed their tyrant in the roar of "no more commandments." I couldn't help but worry a little for Haijingbo and his subordinates.</p>
<p>What if those tigers, leopards, lions, etc., also one day knew that their strength was greater than a whip, and knew that they would get more adequate food after destroying the whip?</p>
<p>Haijingbo has left Shanghai. I also have no intention of sending a telegram to warn him. Besides, do you think he would believe my words?</p>
<p>I feel that I am just as stupid as that person who was marveling!</p>
<h3>Nalan Chengde's Poetics (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Chen Ye</p>
<p>Four</p>
<p>Nalan Chengde's basic understanding of poetry is like this. Starting from this basis, he wrote poems and filled in lyrics, and studied ancient poetry, so he often had many insightful discussions. In "Lushuiting Miscellaneous Records," he criticized many ancient lyricists, such as Mei Cheng, Ruan Ji, Yu Zishan, Tao Yuanming, Xie Tiao, Changli, Wang Jian, Liu Yuxi, Dongpo, Shangu, Ouyang Xiu, Xin Qiji, Yuan Yishan, Zhao Wenmin, Yang Tieya, Yuan Yishan, and even Li Houzhu. In his criticism of these people, he had many good opinions. Many people call Nalan Chengde the reincarnation of Li Houzhu, so first let me introduce his "On Li Houzhu":</p>
<p>The lyrics of the Flower Collection are like ancient jade artifacts, precious but not practical. Song lyrics are practical but not precious. Li Houzhu has both beauties, and is even more enchanting with misty waters.</p>
<p>The Song people compared Fang Weng to Taibai, but he said "not even three or four out of ten." Regarding Su and Xin, he said, "Although the lyrics are called Su and Xin together, Xin is actually better than Su. Su's poetry is hurt by learning, and his lyrics are hurt by talent." Regarding Yang Tieya's Yuefu, he said, "It is another kind of peculiar writing. It is not appropriate to call it Yuefu, and so is Li Bin." Commenting on Zhao Wenmin's poetry, he said, "Not only is he a leader among the Yuan people, but he can be compared to Yan Tongshu in the Song Dynasty." And regarding Yu Zishan and Ouyang Xiu, he further compared them and said:</p>
<p>Yu Zishan's sentences are all based on allusions and are not flexible, while Ouyang Xiu forbids the use of even one allusion, so he becomes bland and empty, with no meaning at all.</p>
<p>In these places, you can see Nalan Chengde's brilliant views on poetry. Regarding Right Poetry and Yuefu, he also discussed them a lot, such as saying "Han people's Yuefu are mostly rich and treacherous, the Nineteen Old Poems are all noble and淡, " and "Jiaozhongqing's wife is also a different style in Yuefu." In particular, his opinions on Shaoling's Yuefu:</p>
<p>Shaoling's self-created new Yuefu is indeed a outstanding person of all time.</p>
<p>This judgment and his views on poetry are most easily seen to be consistent. Nalan Chengde criticized ancient lyricists, emphasizing the place where he expressed his originality, and his arguments were mostly so strong.</p>
<p>Five</p>
<p>Nalan Chengde also had many opinions on the overall criticism of poetry in various dynasties. For example, he commented on Song lyrics: "Since the wars of the Five Dynasties, the Central Plains drama has withered, the way of poetry has been lost, and the short lyrics have flourished greatly. The Song people specialized in lyrics, which were truly exquisite. Their poetry was like dust-covered rice and mud-smeared soup, so it was far inferior to the Tang people." This judgment cannot be said to have no problems, because the rise of Song lyrics was definitely not due to just these two reasons, but in many places, it was also a "unique insight," as another article says:</p>
<p>The Elegies and Odes mostly use allegory, and the Songs of the States mostly use comparison and metaphor: the Songs of Chu came out of the Songs of the States, purely using comparison and metaphor, with very little allegory; Tang poetry followed the style of Elegies and Odes, mostly using comparison and metaphor; Song poetry used less comparison and metaphor; Ming poetry is all allegory, and it feels stale and tasteless.</p>
<p>Nalan Chengde's discussion of Yuefu is also quite interesting. Many articles involve this issue, with opinions, explanations, and doubts. He pointed out that Yuefu was the name established by Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty, not the poetry and rites that later people considered to be poetry and rites. He also said that, in general, ancient poems were specially written for music and singing, called Yuefu; there were also literary men who occasionally wrote, and the musicians composed music and sang them, which were also called Yuefu. He also said that many people today cannot understand the topic of Yuefu, so there is no need to force them to do it; Li Yulin's imitation of Youmeng's clothing only made people laugh. These opinions may be based on some evidence and can allow us to see his diligent research attitude. At the same time, in Lushuiting Miscellaneous Records, it is explained that not only Yuefu can be sung, but poetry, lyrics, and songs have all had extremely holy times of singing.</p>
<p>Song people's lyrics, but the Tang people's method of singing poetry was abandoned; when Yuan Qu arose, they were both abandoned, and when Southern Qu arose, Northern Qu was also abandoned: the songs of today are like the Ming Deer and dust-covered rice.</p>
<p>Historical poetry was also discussed in Lushuiting Miscellaneous Records, and some very research-oriented opinions were provided. In Nalan Chengde's opinion, the intention is to be intentional without falling into discussion. Once there is discussion, it becomes historical criticism. He also said that the events in one's own story should only be used in the poems about history, and the events in another's story must be clearly distinguished between the host and the guest. If they are only used as ancient events, it is not appropriate to do so. The text must show the meaning, and the meaning must be in the text, without revealing the intention.</p>
<h3>Editorial Office</h3>
<p>To Mr. Xiong Shounong: I have been busy with work and have not been able to read the supplements of various newspapers extensively. Yesterday, Mr. Yu Wenwei submitted an article "Mourning Mr. Zhu Xiang." It was published in a certain newspaper a few days ago. I did not see it, so it was republished in "Free Talk." Thank you for your guidance. I will pay attention to prevent this type of event from happening again in the future. At the same time, I hope that the contributors will not submit one manuscript to two places. The readers will be fortunate! The editor will be fortunate!</p>

<h3>The Two Brothers (6)(5)</h3>
<p>— Guy de Maupassant, translated by Li Weike</p>
<p>Jean immediately stood up:</p>
<p>"I'm not crazy, but I've had enough of your face."</p>
<p>Pierre mocked him:</p>
<p>"You've had enough? Are you part of Mrs. Lehau?"</p>
<p>"You need to know that Mrs. Lehau is about to become my wife."</p>
<p>The other laughed even harder!</p>
<p>"Ah! Ah! Great. I now know why I shouldn't call her "widow" anymore. But you used a strange way to inform me of your marriage."</p>
<p>"I won't allow you to joke... Do you hear me... I won't allow you to joke?"</p>
<p>Jean walked closer, pale, his voice trembling. He was even more enraged by the continued mockery of the woman he loved, the woman he had chosen.</p>
<p>But Pierre suddenly became equally furious. All the pent-up anger, suppressed resentment, recently restrained revulsion, and silent grief in his heart surged into his mind, making him seem congested and deranged.</p>
<p>"You dare?…… You dare?…… I order you to shut your beak, do you hear me, I order you to shut your beak!"</p>
<p>Jean, not expecting him to be so violent, was silent for a moment, searching in the confused thoughts that we have when we are in great anger for words and phrases that could directly wound his brother's heart.</p>
<p>He tried to calm himself down so that he could strike with more force, trying to speak slowly so that his words would sound more sharp:</p>
<p>"I've known for a long time that you're jealous of me. I've known it since the day you started calling her "widow," because you knew that title was hurting me."</p>
<p>Pierre let out the sharp, contemptuous laugh he was used to:</p>
<p>"Ah! Ah! God! I'm jealous of you!…… Me?…… Me?…… Me?…… What am I jealous of you for?…… What am I jealous of you for?…… God! Am I jealous of your face or your brain?……"</p>
<p>But Jean knew he had touched his sore spot:</p>
<p>"That's right, you're jealous of me. You've been jealous of me since you were a child: you got angry when you saw this woman choose me and not you."</p>
<p>Pierre was so enraged by this speculation that he couldn't speak clearly:</p>
<p>"I…… I…… I'm jealous of you? For this stupid thing, for this bastard woman, for this fat goose?……"</p>
<p>Jean, seeing that his words had hit him, continued:</p>

<h3>Admonition Against Smoking</h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>I haven't written talks for a long time, and I always feel itchy. On the one hand, it is because now is the year to only talk about wind and moon. People who write articles must have a skill in praising and admiring, such as favorable weather and national peace. But I am ashamed to say that this is really beyond my expertise, and there is no way, so I have to put down my pen. But on the other hand, it is indeed too lazy (I dare not say busy). Therefore, I simply think that everything is going well. In fact, it is ultimately because there is nothing to talk about. Fortunately, this time I spent a morning's effort to think of such a safe and sound topic.</p>
<p>Admonishing against smoking is exactly the same as admonishing against whoring and gambling. It is not like accumulating Yin merits, so I feel more at ease.</p>
<p>Recently, I have indeed been like this. Whenever I see a friend smoking, I sincerely and earnestly advise him: "Friend, quit smoking, why bother?" But every time it is the same, the friend immediately replies to me: "You advise me to quit smoking? Why don't you advise yourself?" Really, it is quite funny to think about it. Isn't it true that everyone would laugh out tears if a procuress taught a prostitute to be a respectable woman? But I still advise people to quit smoking and write articles against smoking. I would not dare to be so bold without a full reason.</p>
<p>To put it a little further, I do not know that advising people to quit smoking is a very sinful thing. For example, take myself. If I don't have money to buy vegetables, I can eat tofu without soy sauce, but I can't not smoke. Especially when my right hand is holding a pen and writing something on paper, my left hand must have a Golden Mouse brand cigarette, otherwise I cannot fill a five-hundred-word manuscript paper. From this, it can be seen that tobacco is truly too destined for those who play with pen and ink.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I must smoke when playing five hundred, I must smoke when sitting in the Great World listening to Yuan Yuan's singing, I must smoke when talking about worldly affairs with old friends, I must smoke when attending a tea party, and I must smoke when going to the toilet to shit, and I must smoke even more when reading "Tears and Laughter Marriage" or "Outside the Circle of Love"... In this way, the benefits of smoking are great! How can one quit?</p>
<p>But recently, after listening to a friend surnamed He say, "Let's quit smoking," this reminded me that in China, tobacco really can't be smoked anymore. At that time, it was like this: I said, "Why quit smoking?" He said well, "Don't you know? Because of the bandit suppression donation? Cigarettes have gone up in price again." That night, after waking up in the middle of the night, urinating once, and going back to bed, I secretly smoked a cigarette and couldn't help but think about the day's events, so I carefully calculated it. The current Golden Mouse brand is fifteen copper coins a box, with ten cigarettes, which is exactly fifteen big coins per cigarette. If you buy it retail, it is three copper coins for two cigarettes, so you don't need to find change. But when the price goes up, it will at least become seventeen cash per cigarette. Fifty cash for three cigarettes, the cigarette store will definitely not do it, one hundred and twenty cash for seven cigarettes, there is no reason for that either. After calculating, it is either four copper coins for two cigarettes, or twenty cash per cigarette. If this goes on, the cigarette store will of course be smiling because they can earn a few more dollars, but the smokers will inevitably be out of luck. At least they will have to smoke two fewer cigarettes from their daily habit of ten cigarettes so that they will not exceed their monthly budget.</p>
<p>Going a step further, it is better to quit smoking, because donating money to kill people is ultimately a matter of damaging Yin virtues! If you can't quit, then you will have to switch to foreign cigarettes. Why? The reason is very clear.</p>
<p>As an attached statement, this article does not advise people to quit opium red pills. This is of course because they do not need to be advised. Those who have money to smoke opium donate silver dollars to buy poison gas cannons.</p>
<h3>On Life</h3>
<p>— Mu</p>
<p>The question of life occasionally floats into my mind, and I think about the past, the present, and the future... Various phenomena and problems stir up huge waves in my mind like the spring tide.</p>
<p>The past life 丨 the golden age of childhood was infinitely sweet, the more one remembers it, the better it seems, but the more one thinks about it, the more frustrated and sad one becomes, for the golden age of childhood can never be regained! The youthful days of adolescence were also infinitely sweet, studying, exercising, sightseeing, and even falling in love at school, enjoying the most carefree, wonderful, and happy happiness of life, 丨 which is also pleasing to remember, the more one thinks about it, the better, but the more one thinks about it, the more frustrated and sad one becomes, for the youthful days of adolescence can never be regained!</p>
<p>Leaving school life and stepping into society, one has tasted all the bitter, sour, and spicy flavors, 丨 although one has sometimes tasted sweet and wonderful flavors, 丨 which only makes you struggle for life all day long, fighting with society, and remembering it brings no benefit, only sadness, resentment, and depression!</p>
<p>As for the present life, the social environment oppresses you to the point of suffocation. If you are ignorant or careless enough to speak out your thoughts, then arrows and poisonous gas, rumors and slanders, open and secret attacks will launch a total assault, making it impossible for you to eat and live in peace! How can one have the freedom and happiness of birds in the sky and fish in the water!</p>
<p>If the present life is like this, will the future life be better? Just thinking about it is disheartening! Why do people have to be so exclusive, jealous, hateful, and attacking? If everyone pursues their own ideals and goes their own way, and if that's not possible, couldn't we at least love and help each other? Why doesn't everyone move towards this path of mutual love and help? As long as you think with a broad mind and long-term vision, whose ideals will be different? People suffer from shortsightedness, only looking at the present and not seeking the future. As a result, conflicts arise for the sake of immediate life, leading to exclusion, jealousy, hatred, and attacks between people. Therefore, the path of life is bitter! Therefore, everyone feels oppressed by the present life, and everyone feels vague about the future life. Everyone feels this way, which is actually caused by the thoughts and actions of each individual. Don't blame others, you yourself have created your life like this!</p>
<p>Let's overthrow shortsightedness and broaden our horizons, let's shout.</p>
<p>Then, if everyone's ideals are the same, everyone loves and helps each other, and everyone's life is happy, all the demons and monsters in society will flee in panic, and society will be such a beautiful and bright place!</p>
<p>For the sake of life, everyone should walk towards this bright road!</p>

<h3>The Fur Coat</h3>
<p>— Shi Ben</p>
<p>In this snobbish era of "only respecting clothes, not people," the issue of "clothing" is so important! Especially when working in government offices, people always say "impressive appearance," and the issue of "clothing" is even more important! As long as you are dressed a little shabbily, people will surely look down on you! Colleagues will try to push you down. Conversely, if you dress nicely, you will be respected, and colleagues will be friendly to you everywhere. This is a common and terrible phenomenon in today's snobbish society, and everyone knows it.</p>
<p>I work for a newspaper, and the four or five colleagues inside are all like bitter gourds bumping into each other. We are all struggling writers, and everyone is equally poor and embarrassed. Therefore, no one looks down on anyone. We don't care much about the quality of our clothes. However, because of the nature of my job, I have to interact with the outside world every day, so clothing becomes an issue. Because I was poorly dressed a few times, I always ended up with people "disdaining to speak" when I went to interview for news! They would speak evasively and dishonestly, how could I get accurate news? I was extremely angry, but when I thought about it, "clothing" was indeed an important trick for interviewing news! I couldn't help but pay attention to it. So, I started to care about my clothes, and most of my salary was spent on "clothing." It's hard! In the past two years, I have been exhausted trying to maintain this poor facade, and I owe a lot of money. I worry about it day and night. Alas! "Dressed in silk, but no rice for dinner at home," I, who used to be frugal, am now just like my old friends on Zhengjia Muqiao in Shanghai.</p>
<p>In the past two days, the west wind has started to blow, and the weather has suddenly turned cold. Everything in the world has changed. People are even busier with their preparations. Rich people with money have fur coats, cotton clothes, fireplaces, and radiators, which have emerged in response to the season. Poor me, trying to maintain a facade, is still wearing a camel hair robe. Walking on the road in the early morning and late at night, the cold wind is bone-chilling, and the cold dew cracks my skin. I deeply feel the cruel coercion of nature. Every time the northwest wind blows, I think that the weather is so cold, the camel hair robe is already outdated. If I wear it when I go to see people, won't they look down on me again? But, if I take off this camel hair robe, what can I replace it with? Wasn't the black sheepskin robe I wore last year pawned at "Yi Liu Bank" in the spring because the landlady was urging me to pay the rent? I plan to redeem it and wear it now, but where can I get the principal of twenty dollars at once? As for the monthly salary of twenty dollars from the newspaper, it is used to cover the living expenses of my wife and me, oil, salt, firewood, rice, rent, and social expenses. In this era of high living costs, what is it enough for? Therefore, since last year, I have been pawning and borrowing money, living a "borrowing from tomorrow to pay for today" life every day. So, even if I have twenty dollars in salary next month, I won't have any extra money to redeem this fur coat. But, if I don't redeem it, it won't do. First, the weather is getting colder, and a camel hair robe is not enough to keep warm after all. Second, appearance is important. It's too embarrassing not to wear a fur coat in the cold weather. Moreover, didn't my colleagues Jianqiu and Tianmei advise me yesterday: "You should try to redeem this fur coat, because when a person works in society, this facade must be maintained! If you really don't wear a fur coat this year, people will say behind your back: 'So-and-so is in trouble this year, he hasn't even put on a fur coat.' Then people will look down on you, and your reputation will be greatly affected." I knew all along that in this society of "only respecting clothes, not people," a fur coat is indeed very important. Whether you wear it or not affects your reputation! But, I can't maintain this poor facade this year. I have been planning for more than twenty dollars for many days, but I still haven't found a solution. I have nothing left to pawn, and I have no place to borrow money. I have exhausted all my resources, what else can I do? In the past two days, I have been so worried about this fur coat problem that I can't eat or sleep, I am sad and heartbroken, and I can't think of any solution. Alas! The oppression of material things is so profound!</p>
<h3>Talking About Roads</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>The first unpleasant thing when walking from the concession to the Chinese-controlled area under our government is that the roads are different. The roads in the concession are only wet after it rains, while the roads in the Chinese-controlled area are muddy and impassable after it rains. Could it be that roads also have a distinction between domestic and imported products? This year, the business community in Shanghai, especially the silk industry, has been shouting at the top of their lungs to promote "Domestic Goods Year." At the same time, the Ministry of Finance of the National Government is issuing lottery tickets to raise funds for the construction of aviation highways. I wonder if the money raised will actually be used to build highways in the future (I won't talk about aviation here). Will they still build some domestic roads? Although I am ignorant, I would like to offer a suggestion, as even a fool's thoughts may have some merit. Since it is said to be highway construction, the roads in the Chinese-controlled area are naturally different, but don't even mention highways. Whenever highways are mentioned, the roads are always rugged and uneven. When the weather is sunny, dust flies, and when it rains, mud splashes. Which highway is not equally corrupt? If the money raised from the lottery tickets is actually used to build highways, I think at least a model highway should be built across the country, with a solid foundation and the surface covered with asphalt. Then, travel will be convenient, and driving public buses will not make people worry about being injured in the buttocks and internal organs. By all means, do not build domestic roads.</p>
<p>Speaking of highways and public buses, it reminds me of the relationship between cars and roads. There is something called a Road Association, I don't know if it is a private organization or a publicly funded one. When they hold exhibitions, in addition to promoting roads, they also specifically promote foreign cars. I used to suspect that it was subsidized by the American Ford Motor King, but now I know that there is not much relationship. Even if it is related to foreign car companies, it is not surprising. Once roads are built, they are bound to be used for vehicles. The domestic single-wheeled wooden carts and two-wheeled horse-drawn carriages have been eliminated, and the need for cars is undoubtedly supported. Since Chinese people have not yet established factories to manufacture cars, it is clear and obvious that imported cars should be adopted. In this way, promoting road construction should logically and rightfully promote foreign cars, who would dare to criticize it. Moreover, although domestic cars have not yet been manufactured in factories, there are already public buses assembled with foreign parts. However, how unreliable and durable are those domestic products, how can they catch up with the quality of foreign cars? China must purchase foreign cars to build roads. This is the knowledge of experts, so they dare not monopolize it and offer it to the Chinese people and promote it. How sufficient, thorough, profound, and righteous is the reasoning? However, let's not talk about it. It is beneficial to others and harmless to oneself, which is the essence of morality in your country, and I also support it. The so-called people who benefit are the international imperialists, which is also in line with the spirit of international technical cooperation of our National Government, and should be greatly supported. However, why don't the capitalists of our Chinese industrial sector jointly set up factories to manufacture cars to compete with foreign cars in the market and recover our rights and interests? Some people say that the capital of our Chinese national bourgeoisie has already been controlled and oppressed by the financial power of international imperialism. They are in this semi-colonial country and have no chance to turn over and raise their heads, so the industry and commerce are depressed. This statement may be true. Then, since the government wants to build highways, why not even manufacture the cars that run on the highways? If the government sets up factories to manufacture cars, and at the same time raises tariffs on imported foreign cars, the car business is also a great source of profit. Then, the lottery tickets issued by the Ministry of Finance of the National Government to raise funds for the construction of aviation highways should be changed to the name of constructing highways and manufacturing cars, and the large sum of money should be used for constructing highways and manufacturing cars. I think this humble suggestion of mine will surely be supported by most of my compatriots. The reason is that constructing aviation has no real benefit for our common people. If we buy airplanes and do not go to deal with the imperialist enemies but start a civil war and drop bombs on our common people, this is even more unacceptable.</p>
<h3>My Future Plans</h3>
<p>— Yizhi</p>
<p>Although this year is the Year of Domestic Goods, it can also be said to be the Year of Plans. Look, one plan here, another plan there, plans are springing up like bamboo shoots after a rain, becoming more and more numerous every day. But what are they planning? This is determined by each person's position. Generally, what the party and state dignitaries are planning, in addition to building villas and marrying wives, is nothing more than pacifying the country internally and resisting foreign aggression externally, benefiting the country and the people. The Guangzhou ×× Three-Year Plan and the Central ×× Whole Plan are plans for pacifying the country internally and resisting foreign aggression externally, benefiting the country and the people. What the military men are planning, in addition to plundering, is nothing more than expanding their territory and extending their influence. What the capitalists are planning is nothing more than selling counterfeit goods as domestic goods and deceiving customers with big discounts. What the bourgeois class is planning is nothing more than leisure and enjoyment. Only those poor and suffering friends still have no plans. Perhaps they have no reason to plan even if they want to. In short, planning is as popular and modern today as a modern girl wearing a fur-collared coat.</p>
<p>I am not a party and state dignitary, nor am I a person who specializes in plundering and enjoying pleasure. Originally, I am not qualified to have plans. However, I think that planning is not limited to the present, and everything in the future can be planned in advance. Therefore, I have a preliminary plan for the future:</p>
<p>(1) Write more articles praising local officials, so that I can be favored by them and give up my writing career to join the army.</p>
<p>(2) Do not discuss national politics, do not talk about military affairs, only write flattering articles, only write poems about love and romance, so that there will be no danger.</p>
<p>(3) Stay at home all year round, not taking a step beyond the bounds, because during this period of pacifying the country, stepping out of the house means risking being hit by stray bullets from the police catching thieves on the road, so if I want to go out, I must wear an iron helmet and a suit of armor to prevent accidents.</p>
<p>(4) Tell my beautiful and graceful sister to go to dance halls more often and go to the movies more often. Once she gains the love of a big man, I can rely on her connections to get lucky.</p>
<p>(5) I run a domestic goods store, but I can't help but stock up on Eastern, European, and American goods to pass off fake goods as genuine. This is the only way for merchants to make a fortune.</p>
<p>(6) Spend a lot of money to marry a star as a concubine, so that I can improve my reputation and make people envy my good fortune in love.</p>
<p>If I proceed according to the above plan, ten years later, if I am not a popular person in society, I must be an idiot.</p>

<h3>Shanghai (2) (4)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Lao San</p>
<p>(36) Trouble Maker</p>
<p>A tram came and cut off the conversation. There were only two passengers in the first-class carriage besides the ticket seller. I occupied a corner of the carriage, and Sister Hui sat next to me. When buying tickets, she touched her pocket, smiled, and said to me, "I didn't bring any money." I glanced at her, paid for two military tickets, and didn't say anything.</p>
<p>"I didn't plan to come out," Cousin continued.</p>
<p>"Such hospitality is too sincere."</p>
<p>Cousin lowered her head. Temporarily silent, the car quickly moved forward.</p>
<p>A white man came in at the Foch Road station. The exotic atmosphere of Zhenfei Road was already visible in front of us. As the car approached the second stop, Cousin rummaged through her pocket and took out a letter to give to me. She looked flustered and said, "This is the letter you wrote to me." She blushed and looked out the window, being stared at by the tall nose opposite. The car stopped at the second stop, and a group of passengers poured in. The carriage suddenly became lively. I didn't have a chance to read the returned letter, so I stuffed it into my pocket and got off at Luban Road.</p>
<p>Today is Sunday, and many friends came to the club. When we stepped in, my younger brother was holding Xiao Huang's arm. The crowd shouted in a mess, "Long live love!" Sister Hui ran to Sister Jing with bounding strides and grabbed her hand, asking her what was so funny. I, who was walking slowly into the living room behind, was completely baffled by this sudden change of attitude.</p>
<p>Xiao Huang pulled down the hand of my younger brother hanging on her arm and ran upstairs as if she was worried about something. Before I could pay attention to him, Gao Fei shouted:</p>
<p>"The trouble maker ran away again!"</p>
<p>Xiao Feng and Chongqing remembered the trouble of the love triangle, looked at Sister Min and Sister Hui standing opposite each other, and then shifted their gazes to me, as if telling me what was being teased here. I, who was in a very suspicious position at this time, didn't dare to say an ordinary word, because an unnecessary misunderstanding might be caused by an ordinary word. When I walked to the table and took out a cigarette, Sister Min and Sister Hui, who were acting antagonistically, greeted everyone and jumped upstairs, seemingly sticking to their positions.</p>
<p>The room was suddenly silent. Gao Fei pulled me to sit on the sofa and told me that after I left in the morning, Sister Min looked for you everywhere and didn't even eat lunch, but she wasn't angry on the surface. Our friends were teasing her about the love triangle. Did you really go to Huiqin's place?</p>
<p>I nodded, not knowing whether I was expressing "yes" or "I know." I stood up and paced back and forth in the living room. The cigarette butt burned my fingers before I threw it into the spittoon.</p>
<p>The second cigarette was in my hand, and I was still pacing back and forth in the room. The tea room attendant, Afu, came down from upstairs and asked me, "Mr. Li, would you like to have egg fried rice?"</p>
<p>"Dinner has been served," I looked at Gao Fei and said.</p>
<p>"It's almost two o'clock, Mr. Li. Miss Xu said you haven't eaten either."</p>
<p>"Okay," I raised my head and looked at the clock on the wall, it was five minutes to two.</p>

<h3>A Glimpse into Mae West's Private Life</h3>
<p>— Jia Ke</p>
<p>Her appearance reveals supreme romance</p>
<p>But her heart is extremely upright</p>
<p>Mae West's "I'm No Angel" has finished its run at the Cathay Theatre, and is now playing for several days at the Carlton. It seems that after sweeping through America, it has come to sweep through China, making many Shanghai movie fans intoxicated in her bewitching and dissolute performance for two hours. What is the impression that people get after seeing Mae West's movies? What do they guess about her personal private life? I am afraid that everyone always thinks that she must be an extremely romantic and unrestrained woman, right? This is not to blame everyone. Originally, various American film magazines have a lot of publicity about Mae West's personal life, deliberately making it cloudy and rainy, making it unpredictable. In fact, those are the promotional techniques of film merchants. It is said that Mae West herself is indeed a well-behaved woman. There are three film actors who have co-starred with Mae West, and kissed her on the screen. They are now coming out to prove it.</p>
<p>Before going to Hollywood, Mae West was originally a star on the Broadway stage. One of those who have performed with her on stage is Arthur Vinton. He co-starred with Mae West in many famous plays, and I won't list them all here. He said, "When I was assigned to contact Mae West for co-starring, I was initially very reluctant, because I felt that she was a very difficult woman to approach. But for the sake of my work, I finally went to see her. Unexpectedly, after talking to her, I found that she was indeed a down-to-earth woman. On the surface of her most feminine body, she has the most masculine brain. This is where she is great. The agility of her mind is like the trigger on a pistol. No matter what you say or what you are planning, she always chases ahead of you. As for the various rumors outside, they are not true. Her few characteristics are: being punctual, not being afraid of hard work, treating people with humility and politeness, and never being arrogant. And in general, colleagues are very polite to her, because she is not someone who can be messed with casually. No matter what the time, people always call her Miss West, and no one calls her just Mae. And when she calls people, she always adds the title of Mr. As for saying that she is a seductive woman, I can say that anyone who has been close to her can know that it is not true."</p>
<p>Generally, a woman who is naturally lewd must have a very vicious heart, but Mae West's heart is infinitely kind. She often does not hesitate to spend her own money and energy to help people. She can be considerate of people, help people, and never have selfish intentions. The following is the word of Jack la Rue. He co-starred with Mae West in (Diamond Lil). He talks about how he was able to be Mae West's supporting role. At that time, Mae West was looking for a Spanish boy. He was Italian, but a good actor. His contract was about to expire, and he was anxiously looking for something to do. Being Mae West's supporting role was the best hope. So he went to see Mae West. Mae asked him if he was Spanish. He answered with a few Spanish words that he learned from a speed learning association. She also asked him if he could perform. He said he was willing to try his skills on the spot. So they performed on the spot. After the performance, Mae West said: Not bad, not bad. She asked him when he could start auditioning. Jack said he had a long-term contract with a company. Mae West was very surprised. If he had a long-term contract with another company, why did he come to see her? Jack said that if the money was more, he would rather give up the long-term contract and cooperate with her. Mae West agreed to everything, and Jack's salary was very high, beyond his own expectations. However, after they auditioned several times, she investigated everything clearly. She knew that he was not Spanish, and that he did not have any long-term contract. Obviously, she was deceived. But she didn't hate him. Instead, she saw him and laughed. She said that when a person has no way to go, it is forgivable to play a trick occasionally. Therefore, Jack was very grateful to her.</p>
<p>There is also Russell Hardil, who has co-starred with Mae West in countless plays on the screen or on the stage. He also proves that Mae West is a very upright person. He has never seen her behave in a lewd manner outside of the stage or screen. She likes to joke and have fun, that is true, but she has never lost the respect of others. Her use of "sex" to perform is something that others cannot achieve, and is something that others dare not do. Apart from Mae West, if others want to learn from her, not only will they absolutely not be able to learn, but there are also many dangers. The fact that she did not fall into the miscellaneous troupe, or a more humble position, but was able to achieve her current lofty position is what makes her great and unattainable.</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3>Review of "Evil Neighbor"</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>| Moonlight Production, Carlton Premiere |</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>First, I must discuss with Mr. Fasi, the playwright of "Evil Neighbor." Is it truly because China has embraced Western material civilization and abandoned the old morality of national essence that it has become so fragmented, leading to its imminent demise? I believe this is the author's biggest conceptual mistake.</p>
<p>We can say with certainty that so-called old morality and spiritual civilization are the superstructure built upon the economic foundation. Now, the economic system has developed from rural economy to capitalism. Then, the old morality of the superstructure must necessarily change its essence with the transformation of the economic system. That is to say, old morality will never continue to be effective under the existing economic system. This is the same reason why feudal emperors cannot survive in capitalist society. Old morality has naturally disappeared completely, and material civilization is also inevitably the most rational product of the current society. Obviously, the old is only destroyed, and the new is growing rapidly. This is an ironclad historical decision that no one can ignore.</p>
<p>So, why is there an exception in China? Could it be said that the rural economy in China has not suffered destruction?</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>Therefore, China's poverty and weakness, China's being divided and slaughtered, are definitely not because of the decline of old morality or because it should not have accepted Western material civilization. The only reason is that China's current status is that of a semi-feudal and semi-colonial state.</p>
<p>Indeed, "Evil Neighbor" expresses opposition to the aggression of strong neighbors, but taking narrow nationalism as a premise is already a dead end, not to mention the author's erroneous understanding as mentioned above?</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>Due to the seriousness of the errors mentioned above, I cannot help but point them out more strictly. I think this is the critic's most important responsibility in guiding the audience. In fact, audiences with low levels of knowledge will go down the wrong path because of its distortion.</p>
<p>In addition, I strongly disagree with the author's purely symbolic approach to dealing with this issue. For example, representing Japan as the evil neighbor, the township council as the League of Nations, "Zhong Guofen" as the Chinese soul, "Huang Huaren" as the Yellow race, "Bai Jinji" as the economy of the white race, "Wu Zhihua" as matter, and "Cai Mafu" as certain national heroes. Because of this, it completely loses its seriousness and activeness. Of course, everything is not free at the moment, but positive depictions should still be made within the possible range.</p>
<p>(4)</p>
<p>In terms of filmmaking techniques, Moonlight Company has indeed made some progress compared to the past, whether in photography, performance, or set design. However, they are still obsessed with martial arts fights (allegedly for sales in Nanyang and the mainland). This cannot be praised in terms of martial arts techniques, and in this respect, what difference is there from the recently premiered "Six Episodes of Female Escort"? I believe that not abandoning martial arts fights is always a loss for Moonlight Company.</p>
<p>As for individual actors, the one who played Huang Huaren is the best, followed by Wang Feijuan, who is also natural.</p>
<p>(5)</p>
<p>In addition, I think that the "Shaw's humor, Hitler's tragedy" etc. on the instructions are not a clever publicity method. Also, most of the so-called "humorous subtitles" are not visible in the film.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it should be added that in yesterday's first show, there were two Japanese people there watching very enthusiastically, and I heard them talking very indignantly. From this, it can be seen that the Japanese are very attentive to movies, truly so-called caring people are meticulous.</p>
<h3>Review of "History of the Great War in Europe"</h3>
<p>— Moore</p>
<p>Hells "Holiday"</p>
<p>Friche said in "Twentieth Century European Literature": "One of the main components of the ideological structure of imperialist literature is the praise of violence and war." This is not necessarily a clear example in literature, but it is also reflected in movies. Their essential means is to beautify war, emphasize the national concept of the masses, and erase the tragic scenes of war.</p>
<p>However, amid the rumbling of cannons, those who die in batches are only the hardworking people. Beautiful deception can no longer withstand the attack of facts. Thus, outstanding writers "dropped the hammer of truth on the hypocrisy, cruelty, and blood caused by war." (Gorky) Henry Barbusse's novel "Under Fire" depicts the transformation of international war to revolutionary war. And after painful reflection, Remarque and others also wrote his humanitarian "All Quiet on the Western Front," and it was quickly made into a movie.</p>
<p>The great war of 1936, predicted by international politicians, will begin in the Far East. At this time, every character is "itching to fight" and "preparing to fight." So, they quickly reviewed the old lessons of the European war. On the one hand, the newsreels of that time had lost their timeliness, so they were edited and added to become new films to make money. There have been many such films recently. "The Blood Battle History of Xing Dengbao" is famous, and currently we are seeing this "History of the Great War in Europe."</p>
<p>As the advertisement claims, this film was actually shot on location. Because it was originally a newsreel, it was only an objective existence. After being produced once, it has been injected with subjectivity. In other words, the writer has already expressed his opinion on this existence. Now, in "History of the Great War in Europe," we only see the power of cannons, but not the suffering of the people. Even if we see smoke rising, it seems to only form the conditions for this "power" and this "spectacle." From this, we can see the producer's intention is to "review old lessons," not to feel sorrow for the old events. This can naturally be said to be due to the newsreels of that time, but precisely because it is a newsreel of that time, it is a praise of war, and our writers use it, which more accurately explains the meaning.</p>
<p>Recently, "anti-war films" have been opposed by some. Naturally, only war can eliminate war, but we must pay attention that only revolutionary national wars are what we should expand, while imperialist mutual robbery wars and intervention wars are what we should oppose. If there is a promotion of "killing" and "drinking blood" for other purposes, it will only plunge the people into a bottomless abyss, and the result is to consolidate the position of the privileged (imperialists and others). The outbreak of the Second World War is just around the corner. From the "History of the Great War in Europe," we see their conspiracy! Audiences! "Not in war, until the war, must form brothers!" (Barbusse) We are against imperialist war!</p>
<h3>Listen, Husbands of the World</h3>
<p>— Xi Fu</p>
<p>In Wall Street, New York, USA, there is a rich man named Stephen Ames. Because he is generous and blessed, Hollywood considers him "one of the million husbands." What is the reason? It's very interesting to talk about. Stephen has a beautiful wife, and she wanted to go to Hollywood to make movies two years ago. Stephen, because she begged him so many times, couldn't bear to go against her wishes, so he agreed generously. That wife is the famous Adrienne Ames. But a female star, if she lacks a male companion, is extremely inconvenient in social situations. But he himself holds an important position in the financial world of New York, making a lot of money every day, how can he give up his position to accompany his star wife? So, he listened to his wife again and agreed to hire a rising star, Bruce Cabot, as his wife's official male companion, so that he could enter and exit social occasions. Later, Bruce and Adrienne gradually turned friendship into love and became inseparable. So Stephen specially ran to Hollywood for this matter, acting as a matchmaker for them, and he retreated to the ranks of friends. It is said that Bruce and Adrienne, after Stephen's persuasion, will get married soon. Isn't this spirit of selflessness admirable?</p>

<h3>24 Hours in Shanghai (1)</h3>

<p>Directed by Shen Xiling, produced by Star Film Company</p>
<p>Starring Zhu Qiuhen, Zhou Boxun, Chen Ningqiu, Zhao Dan, Gu Meijun, and Gu Lanjun</p>
<p>(1) A Small Matter</p>
<p>4 p.m., when the arteries of the metropolis beat most violently. Cars are connected to trams, and trams are connected to cars: Looking down from the top of a skyscraper: they are two straight lines of ants crawling towards each other...</p>
<p>At this time, a foreign-funded yarn factory is busy. The current of the motor is flowing, and the large axles pull the belts to circulate endlessly. Under the spinning wheels sit a row of female workers, each one's hands are mechanically moving, tense faces, smiling faces, and faces with melancholic anemia. Children picking up yarn under the belt pulleys. It is said that childhood is the "golden age" of life, and the "golden age" of these child laborers is spent in the work of picking up yarn.</p>
<p>Suddenly丨A piece of clothing was brought out on the rapidly rotating belt, and thrown violently into the air. Then there was a sharp scream, which was emitted in the heavy sound of the machine wheel.</p>
<p>At this time, the workers in the entire factory stopped like a machine braking and immediately rushed forward to surround the injured and fallen child. The child's face was pale, and the floor was covered in blood.</p>
<p>"Number 39 is crushed!" "Number 39 is crushed!"</p>
<p>Everyone shouted in panic. A young female worker drilled into the crowd. She suddenly squatted down, hugged the injured lamb, and cried sadly: "Brother! Brother!"</p>
<p>The air in the factory became miserable. In this commotion, the supervisor calmly ran in with the doctor. The doctor looked at the child's injury.</p>
<p>"Is it okay?" A tearful female worker's face looked at the doctor anxiously. But the doctor did not speak, he shook his head gently.</p>
<h3>(2) Comprador and Wife</h3>
<p>This is a noble and beautiful gentleman, Mr. Zhou, the comprador of the yarn factory.</p>
<p>He is listening to the phone. The sound of the foreman speaking carefully came from the telephone receiver, reporting the matter of a child laborer being crushed in the workshop. This report caused a look of anger to flash across the comprador's face. He was not happy to hear these.</p>
<p>"Is there a need to report this? It's their own carelessness, what's there to say!" After answering like this, he put down the receiver. He leisurely flipped through the movie advertisements in the newspaper:</p>
<p>As if thinking of something happy, the comprador suddenly smiled. Then he made a phone call. This phone call was to the comprador's residence. The comprador's wife was lying lazily in bed, gently stroking the docile pug lying next to her with one hand, and picked up the phone on the table with the other.</p>
<p>The comprador's voice from the telephone: "There shouldn't be any prior engagements today, my wife, how about we go to the movies?"</p>
<p>The wife thought for a while, twisted her body, and said charmingly into the phone:</p>
<p>"Um, no, Mrs. Li invited me to her house to play cards today."... (To be continued)</p>
