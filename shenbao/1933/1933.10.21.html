<p>日本以新穀豐收陳米積滞本年竟有一千一百餘萬石而朝鮮及臺灣存餘。尙不在内。故將五。萬包陳米傾消於我國。每包計有一百五十斤。其價格不過六元三角。吾人於此殊不欲作過度情感激刺之語。推我國以農業國家稱。其在國際收支平凖上。僅恃農產品爲抵付外貨輸入之具。而自近數年來。我國手工業製品如瓷器如漆器均日就衰頽。絲業亦一落千丈。縱令政治上能力足以媲美列强。而此種輸入超過之漏巵。經濟上已足引起極嚴重之结果。况在此半年之内。輸入洋米洋麥及其他雜糧。爲數竟達一萬萬以上。則農村所受之影響。不言可知矣。</p>
<p>日本爲後進之工業國家。農民人口不過全人口總數百分之六十左右其國内農產食品及原料。本不足以供給其需要。平時即已如此。况更値世界經濟恐慌狂潮襲來之後日本當然亦陷於不景氣之狀態中不過因其爲輕工業國家而又未脫農業生產之形態。故其受害或較他國爲輕微。加以日本軍閥。素以戰爭之準備。爲解决一切之出路。以軍事工業。刺激其一般生產。而於農業則僅指向於自給自足之途徑。因是統制米穀之說。近復貿然塵上。而米穀生產過剩。市塲積滞。因之過多。因積貨過多。米價遂不能不向下跌落。其跌落之數。竟至於在生產元本之下。農村之困頓乃愈甚。以目前日本之農村經濟情况論。農民負債總數。達七十萬萬日金。每家農民負債在千圓日金以上。</p>
<p>非特農村金融枯竭。借貸無路。甚亦有以雜糧充饑欲求一飽而不可得者而在另一方面。都市上雖有軍事工業之繁榮。并不能挽轉整個社會之頽廢。以故失業人口。無所依歸。海外移民。徒成幻想。（蓋此次經濟恐慌。具有世界性。東方感受恐慌較遲爲禍則更深。故僑商營業不易安定）大都市上之失業人口。旣不能移殖國外。自不能不回流入於鄉村而農村遂益不安此種情勢反映於全體社會。於是所謂惡化思想。乃滲入於極端軍國主義之銳化中。矛盾交織。乃形成日本之現勢。</p>
<p>日閥際此生死關頭。非但不肯放棄其武力政策。且愈加緊張。充實陸軍設備也。補充海軍力也。建設製鋼廠也。統制穀米也。一一在籌劃之中。此次出賣陳米。原爲日本官倉在儲之米。用備軍事時期之軍用者。今一因爲時已久。恐其腐壞。再因農產豐收。乘時更換。故此次日本之出售陳米。表面上不過爲傾消之一種。而實際上之意義。乃含有嚴重之軍事關係性也。</p>
<p>我中國旣爲農業國家。即不能如美洲各國以食糧供給於世界至少亦應足以自給。使民無饑。然而數十年來。農村漸趨破敗。如上海如廣洲如平津等。近海城市。皆藉洋米洋麥。以資生活。甚至沿江沿海各中小城市。亦有賴於舶來之糧食。此種情勢。設在平時。或尙不足爲慮。而在今日全世界政局不安之時。歐洲方面。德法對立形勢之嚴重。德意關係之不能調和。遠東方面。英日經濟鬭爭甚烈。日美造艦競爭開始。而日蘇之關係。愈見惡化。吾人處此危難之中。鑒於當前形勢之緊張。惕於自身實力之脆弱民食一事於我自衛之道亦甚有關係。不可不預爲籌度之也。</p>

<p>服裝的美依什麽做標凖？我想只有在眞僞上分别。什麽是眞美，就質料上言，國產的衣料，是眞美。就顏色上言，樸素不退色的衣料，是眞美。就體裁上言，文雅適用的衣料，是眞美。就經濟上言，價廉而耐用經穿的衣料，是眞美。蓋能着眞美的服裝，纔受人家的尊崇與敬仰，倘使穿了外國花標，外國綢縐呢絨，便是失去了眞美。英后御蘭開夏棉布，而爲全國所尊敬，幾至風氣所趨，全國景從，認爲穿這種衣料是人生無上之光榮，比那繡龍描鳳錦衣華服高貴得多。這便是因爲國布的服裝，是合於眞美的標凖。推而廣之，美亞的綢縐，章華的呢絨，與鴻新的布疋，都是國貨的翹楚，實爲等量齊觀，各有其眞的價値。惟是近來道德淪亡，以僞亂眞，欺世騙人的伎倆，層出不窮，使愛穿眞夜宴晚服</p>
<p>美服裝的，若難辨别。第一質料明明爲劣發洋貨，而改頭換面，使眞正之國產綢縐，國產呢絨，國產布疋，反失推銷之地位。第二顏色應該以不退色取得顧客的信用　，目下退色的衣料，隨處都是，這裏滅殺愛用國貨者的熱心，着實不少。鴻新染織廠經理胥仰南君嘗說，（衣的道德，在不退色。）很有至理。第二體裁方面，也是跟着顏色走的，如果有文雅不退色的衣料，做起衣來，當然適體美觀，人家自然趨之若騖，這是顯而易見的。第四經濟方面，在這國貨年大家樂用國貨時代，出品者惟一的義務，在薄利多賣，在減輕成本，如果趁此機會，高抬價目，這是自取失敗，即有愛用國貨的人，也要退避三舍了，並且出品方面，不但要價廉，還要耐用經穿，才可使服裝的眞美，永遠保持。</p>
<p>眞美的服裝，可愛的眞美服裝，希望注意服裝的廠商，大家來滿足愛用國貨的欲望。</p>

<p>（秋收冬藏）這名老話，是說中國數千年來的習慣，因爲一切農產品，大槪在秋天有了豐潤的收成，到冬天便儲藏起來，可以作一年的用度。所以在冬天的商業，是非常茂盛，民間婚嫁也特别的多，所以出賣衣料的店舖，營業是特别的茂盛。</p>
<p>但是上海，以及距離上海相近的各埠，大槪一般人的置辦衣服，總以夏秋二季較多，因爲夏秋二季的衣料，比較地便宜一些，所以看見心愛的衣料，但隨時購買，隨時製衣，却不曾預算到冬季衣料的置辦費，一到冬天，便無餘力添購。</p>
<p>而實際上，冬季的衣料，是極需要，冬季的服裝，假使應添而不添，便覺得寒酸。現在的社會，又只重衣衫，不重人情，所以家庭喪的服裝費用，應該全年有一種預算，在夏秋雨季，除了必不可少的以外，切不可太浪費，切不可任性添置，而對於冬季服裝，應添則添，不必躊躇。</p>

<p>奇特的志趣狂亂的裝飾（許　）</p>
<p>服裝使各種得益</p>
<p>現在我們要討論第三個問題了··時裝經濟之影響。</p>
<p>在工業的區域裏，時裝好像是生產的興奮劑··不過這只對需要物件而論罷了。因爲對於各季一切時裝的預料，並不可輕易變動的·一方面增加，當然他方面隨之而减··還有需要對於各工業是不同的，在這工業上如此，但在另一工業上就變換了。</p>
<p>奢華的絲織工業，因爲時裝特别的變動得速快，對於織物圖案，組織，顏色等，創作許多新的設計，以供社會的需要·，所以各季發生很大的變化，尤其在這世界經濟恐慌的時候，普通應用的織物，只供一般的需要·，但新奇的織物，往往能引起人興奮高價的購買。在統計數上，明指着··由時裝的變化可獲得巨在的利益·，無論大大小小的工業和家庭工業，已可得益不少了。千千萬萬的男女工人，都依賴着無數的織機，賺得每日的米飯。</p>
<p>以女子衣服的長短而論，當然與紡織工業的盛衰有相當的關係··，所以在流行短而貼身的衣服時，與出產量的銷路就感覺到恐慌·並且有時雖然創行了這樣的時裝，但社會的輿論，有讚美的，也有誹謗的·，一件本來需要的綢料，因此反減少了一半··當然對於工業的生產量，就受到不少的影響了。</p>

<p>女子服裝的色調，是與年齡身材，最有關係，至於衣料的性質，不問綢布呢絨，都是一樣。我們在上海，到馬路上去跑，往往在許多女子的身背後，是瞧不也她正面，究竟是怎樣一個人，差不多都是十八九歲的姑娘。但是衣服的色調，假使用得不當，往往反使大增厭，所以極有研究的價値。</p>
<p>大槪肥胖的人，衣服上最忌的是大花樣，深紅大綠，也不相宜，最好揀比較淺一些的顏色，或者是枊條形長形的小花樣，可以使别人看起來，似乎减少她的肥胖，這是心理學上的一種幻覺，矮的人，也宜乎採用柳條式長形花樣爲宜。</p>
<p>但是也不能一槪而論，假使年齡已過三十，而生得矮胖，那是决不宜再用嬌𧰚的顏色，應該採用中和的顏色了。</p>
<p>普通人的見解，以爲面色白的女子，穿黑的衣服或深色的衣服，一定可以格外顯出雪白的顏面·，但是事實與理想，往往會成反比例的，我們只要留心西洋女子，她們的膚色，是非常潔白，她們除了兩天，或冬天，或年老的人，是很少用深色名黑色，因爲色調的配合，一定求其中和，才覺得諧合而舒適，野蠻的民族，大都喜歡富於刺激性的色調，此外只有妓女，也是如此，文明的都會中，是很少採用有刺激性的色澤，堆在她們身上。所以越是面色潔白的女子，越宜用中和色的衣料，而衣料上的花樣，也應該用雖有規律而並不十分顯明規律的，才能不覺得有火氣。</p>
<p>衣服的美麗，固然可以增加人的美麗，但是上海的女子衣服，太一般地妓女化，而妓女也一般地良家婦女化、這是一件很可憂慮的事。她們完全不曾顧慮到各人自已的年齡，身份，體態，一意孤行地要想變成或勉强造成一個含苞初放的女郎，甚而至於是一個爲羣衆可　倒的姑娘，拚命地在衣服化妝力方面努力。於是所得的結果，是適得其反。要知道女子的美，固然在廿歲左右，是最美，但是三十左右，甚而至於四十左右，如果衣裝適宜，也足以顯出適合她年齡的美，假使要硬扮十七八歲的美，那一定畫虎不成反類犬的。</p>
<p>所以一過中年，應該趨於樸素　而在廿歲左右，也應該番度自已的膚色身段配合適宜的衣服。近來所流行的時候，大半是從西式衣服變化出來的，例如腰支粗肥的人，可以在衣的下腰部兩旁，鑲幾批荷葉邊，可以使人幻視着她的腰骨龐大，而不覺她的腰部粗肥··還有上臂精黑的人，可以做深色的燈籠式短袖，也可以减少粗黑肥臂的醜劣。</p>
<p>瘦長的人，不宜用柳條或長形花樣的衣料　·，肥矮的人，不宜用圓花欄·，腿短的人，不宜用紅類的色調，髮多的人，不宜多用黑色或棕色，這是極顯明而易知的。</p>
<p>中國女人還有一個習性，便是喜歡幾個姊妹，或幾個要好熟識的人，穿着打扮，完全一個樣子·，或者看見别人剪一件衣料，做一件時裝，便同樣的去仿效，而不研究自已穿了是否適合。萬一穿了起來，覺得不好看，但廢棄擱置，這也與經濟方面很有關係。所以各人有各人的合宜衣服，不必專去摹仿别人，這是考究服裝的第一要義，盲從别人，一定不會得到别人的贊美，與自已的滿意。</p>

<p>— 明襄</p>
<p>摩登的廣播或訊號發射機，除主要的振盪級外，至少尙有一級以上的高週率放大，高週率放大級内，最重要的爲平差（Ｎｅｕｕａｌｉｎｇ）裝置，除非所用的眞空管爲簾栅式。平差的目的，是在免去因眞空管管内電容量的交連，使眞空管自生振盪，與振盪級所激勵的週率相干擾，失其放大作用，情形與收音機的高週率級相同。</p>
<p>眞空管用作高週率放大者，通常均爲Ｂ類放大式，其栅極負電位極高，在無激勵（Ｅｘｃｉｔａｔｉｏｎ）時，屠電流實等於零，採用Ｂ類放大以代替通常Ａ類或成音週率放大的理由，是因Ａ類放大的效率，僅有１５％，而Ｂ類可得８０到８５％　　圖示一簡單的振盪放大發射機放大級的線路，振盪級輸出的高週率電能，藉交連電容器Ｃ２經饋電線Ａ及Ｂ，饋至放大級的輸入線路，因有高週率阻流圈ＲＦＯ跨接，故高週率電流不能流入Ｃ電池線路，否則將爲一種損失。測騐此阻流圈的可靠與否，祇須接一旁電容器Ｃ４，如虚綫所示·如接上時屏栅電流毫無變動，即證明此阻流圈完善可靠，反之，已失效用。</p>
<p>栅路　安培表與Ｃ電池相串聯，爲極有價値的指示器，振盪及放大級開啓後，此表即有指數，指示激勵電壓的相當値，所以其作用，實等於高週率電壓</p>
<p>表，在平差放大級時，極有帮助··流經此栅流表的直流，即是高週率電壓經放大管栅極整流後的直電流，此點最須認清。（未完）</p>

<p>— 一知</p>
<p>交流機上電動擴聲器（ＤｙｕａｍｉｃＬｏｕｄｓｐｏａｋｅｒ）有了沙聲，音調即致龐雜含　糊，入耳不悅··這厭聽的沙聲，其發生的原因，約有下列三端··</p>
<p>（一）電磁鐵極上生銹電重擴聲器内有巨大電磁鐵（倘讀者欲知道電動擴聲器的簡單原理和構造，請參看拙作（談談擴聲器）一文，載七月八日出版的本刋）這磁鐵的極上，因受潮氣侵入，及久置不用，極面上生銹，起了一層薄薄的鐵屑，當活動線圈振動時，遂與牠摩擦發生不規則的運動，使發出沙聲，修理的方法··將這擴聲器謹愼拆開，用細砂皮紙（擦發　機上整流子用的）擦凈或以棉花蘸炎油揩凈，乃再塗油少許，用布揩乾，以後不易生銹。</p>
<p>（二）電磁鐵與活動線圈聞積塵沙，母磁塲電磁鐵與活動線圈的間隙距離，約爲千分之一與千五百分之一时，故在其間積有塵沙·活動線圈振動時，能摩擦起沙聲，這塵沙較易去掉，有時將擴聲器倒置，俟其劇烈振動幾下後，塵沙能自然落去。</p>
<p>（三）螺絲鬆弛及其他原因，擴聲器上的螺絲倘有鬆弛，遇振動後，電磁鐵時會輿活動線圈接觸，當活動線圈振動時，因摩擦而起雜音的沙聲··有時活動線圈因構造不佳，着潮或歪斜，亦會發生此弊病，修理的方法··較正活動線圈不與磁鐵接觸，並置在通風處吹燥之。</p>
<p>總之，一具好的電動擴聲器，决不會發也不悅耳的沙聲，發生沙聲，必其活動線圈在振動時與電磁鐵或灰沙相接獨起了摩擦，要保護電動擴聲器不發沙聲，應當置牠在清潔乾燥地方，以免修理的麻煩。</p>

<p>— 魏心蘇</p>
<p>内地電力供給，常有電壓不穏定情形，尤其是在華燈初上，萬家火樹，以及遇特别節慶之時，因電流供给不足，以致電壓低落，對於交流電收音機之使用深受影響·，反之，如遇電流耗用减少，則又常用有電壓過量情形，　以音機更覺危險。其補救之法，可按上圖方法，於收音機電力方棚初級前加上一個降　小方棚（ＳｔｅｐＤｏｗｎＴｒａｎｓｆｏｒｍｅｒ）。此方棚可即以電鈴棚充之，市上有一種初級ＩＩＯＶ次級有２·５·３Ｖ·，５Ｖ·，７·，９Ｖ·等接頭者甚合所需。</p>
<p>譬如甲地之電壓，於黄昏時候有５Ｖ·之降落，則將Ｓ放在５Ｖ·之接頭上，如此則降壓方棚次級之輸出電壓５Ｖ·因與收音機電力方棚輸入電路串聯，故依（甲電壓正極與乙電壓負極相串聯則總電壓等甲電壓加乙電壓）之原理，得彌補其降落之５Ｖ·如遇電壓過量情形，可以雙力雙閘開關使小方棚初绷級接頭倒置，以變換其次級輸出之電極，利用中和原理，以小方棚輸出電壓與收音機電力方棚輸入電壓相消，則（總電壓等於甲電壓減乙電壓）矣</p>
<h3 id="c240">大綫之方向性（續） <a href="#c240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— 勁</p>
<p>上面是鳥瞰時，亦即天線向地平各方收發的情形·現在倘在地平方向觀察，看那天綫向直立方向收發的情形，又有不同。最簡單的直立天線的情形，可見第二圖。由那曲綫可知收發能力最大的方向，是在地平方向，即和地平成零度的方向。和地平所成角度愈大，收發能力愈弱。例如向２５度的能力，由Ｇｂ表之，祇及Ｏ。時Ｇａ的一半。角度愈大，收發能力愈小，直到５０以後簡直没有了。因此用這種　線不能和飛機交通。但是若用厂式時。那天綫的引入線，相當於直立天線，現在那平頂部份祇向天地二方有最大收發能力，除因屈折作用外，對地平方面，幾無收發能力，所以這時恰好由那直立的引入線，擔任地平地面收發，因此這式天線對地平和直立方向都有很大的收發能力。其餘ＴＶ式亦然。</p>
<p>前述的指向性很可利用的。下圖就是最便的利用法··這是當收發天線都用厂式時最好的裝置··就是使二者在同一平面中，且將通地端裝在頭對頭接近的地位。普通收音時將夏厂式天線指着發射台，且將通地端接在發射台這方向，會使接收結果如點，就是因此。不過要注意的，若用很短的天缐，這種指向性不很顯著若那平頂部份愈長而裝得較低，這種指向性愈顯著。（完）</p>

<p>—</p>
<p>用電壓表串聯電池，測騐各種無線電零件有無損壞，這是最簡單而又最凖確的方法。但是此種測騐用的電表，靈敏度必須求其愈高愈妙，否則在測騐時便會感覺到不切實用。</p>
<p>靈敏度可靠的電表，售價很貴，普通試騐無線電的朋友們要購置一具，都不免感覺着相當的困難。本篇特介紹一只構造簡單的試騐電表，以便讀者採用。　　如圖，先以三十六號漆包線在厚紙板糊成的線圈架上繞一二千圈，（圈數愈多，作用愈靈敏）繞就後用銅片將線圈固定在木板上。（圖中銅片，缺去一角，示線圈繞法。）再將普通軍用的懐中指南針一枚，一端嵌入線圈架内，一端亦用銅片夾住。串聯的電池，則置於桌上或藏於板底均可。再移動木板，俟指南針與線圈成直角後，（如圖中所示之狀態。）便可應用。</p>
<p>例如所欲測的是一個變壓器，祇須將各線頭輪流接在Ａ，Ｂ二棧上，視指南針有無移動，便能找出斷綫或是碰線的所在。</p>
<p>上述試騐電表，構造雖很簡單，但是作用却異常靈敏，當線圈内通過半個千分安培時，指針便能跳動。這一點是其他任何廉價的電表所不及的。（注意··此電表内雖一螺釘之微，亦不可使用鋼，鐵等磁化物質，否則磁針即失作用。）</p>

<p>國内播音界之現狀</p>
<p>中國現在各處所有的廣播電台，以電力論，當推南京中央廣播電台爲最大··以數量論，當推上海爲最多··現在先就這兩處電台的播音節目，略加叙述。其餘各處的電台，容再賡續。</p>
<p>南京</p>
<p>中央廣播電台，（ＸＧＯＡ）在未曾改裝大機器前，節目方面，並不像現在這樣豐富。除掉演講，新聞，唱片和最多每星期僅有一次的特别節目（國劇，崑曲等）外，此外也就無善可述。去年夏天該台試騐七萬五千瓦特的播音機時，作者曾去函請求增加下述台種節目··</p>
<p>（一）增設各種學節目，（敎授中文等），使播音事業敎育化。</p>
<p>（二）增添無線電常識及問答等節目灌輸無綫電常識於一般民衆，並解决聽衆試騐時的困難。</p>
<p>（三）加多娛樂節目，以引起民衆對於無綫電的興趣。</p>
<p>該台於去年總理誔辰日正式開幕後，在節目方面，使大事整頓，除上述各點，均已先後添設外，並另加電碼練習，商情報告及國術早操等節目，一時洋洋盈耳，美不勝收。</p>
<p>中央廣播電台對於搜集節目之努力，實在高出於一般人希望之上，過去的事實，可以證明者有··</p>
<p>（一）曾請專家特編大鼓詞數闋，如孫總理倫敦蒙難，秋瑾就義，簽僞約賣身投靠等，分請大鼓名家何質臣，金玉芳等輪流到台奏唱，極爲聽衆所歡迎。</p>
<p>（二）京地各學校，團體及票房等，已被該台輪流演奏殆遍。名伶如程艶秋，新艶秋，徐碧雲等，均已先後在該台播音。去冬開幕時，曾邀請梅蘭芳前來參加，雖以事未能實現，但該台搜羅節目之關心，已可見一斑。</p>

<p>— 李元慶</p>
<p>普通聽筒或是喇叭的引線，使用日久，最易與銅脚（Ｔｉｐ）脫離·，有時雖未脫離，但是内部却早已鬆掉·，因此，使用時就感不便或竟時常容易引起雜聲。補救的方法，祇有拆下重行銲接。</p>
<p>我們知道，引種外鍍金屬物的線紗質導線，（參閱本刋第二十一期）銲接是最感困難的。有時銲錫尙未熔解，導線却早已燒焦特别是在銅脚内，更使你興臂長莫及之嘆！</p>
<p>本篇所介紹的方法，却能替你解除此種困難。先將導線外邊的絶緣物用刀糎左右）次用細銅絲緊繞在導線上。再將銲錫少許塞入銅脚内，（銅脚内部應先整理清潔。）最後用鉗夾住銅脚放在火酒燈上燃燒，俟内部銲錫完全溶解後，將導線用刀挿入，靜冷一分鐘後，便能堅牢如故。（注意導線與銅脚内部，在銲接前均須預塗銲藥。）</p>

<p>用二只釘，一小塊木片或硬厚紙片，和一段無用的粗銅綫即可製成。似乎不値什麽，然而牠的用處却很大，如用在保護燈絲，照亮刻度盤及綫路的試騐等。製法如圖，將一段約十四號粗的光銅綫在筆桿上繞四五圈，一端用一長釘將牠釘在紙上，另外在圈下正中的地方也釘一個釘。將這兩個釘間的距離算準，以便挿入眞空管座中，來試騐燈絲的電壓是否準確。</p>

<p>咱們的中國，和水火實在有緣。在辛亥年光復的時候，有一次在水，那時你正在小學生時代，坐在方桌上吃飯，我還記得。前年又是大水，同時東北是砲火連天，値得痛心紀念的九一八。到了上海之戰，閘北又變了砲火轟擊之地。又是今年黄河决堤的水災了，開封城上，可以看水景。上海灘頭，南京路上，可以行小汽油船。除了這種種事情以外，比較遠些，有奉直戰爭，江浙戰爭，都是給人民不少砲火之賜。没有多時，四川兩劉，打得起勁，是給人民嘗着火味。很秘密而又半公開的劉珍年部在浙江某縣大放其火，也是給人民嘗嘗火味，因爲不曾見過砲火，改了放火了。上海在夏天的時候，游泳塲中，大顯其水技。到了冷天，又是蹲在火爐旁，一劉也不肯走開，青年人愛吸鴉片，向火行禮，閒的時候，又搶了水蛇般女人，狂跳其水手無了。咳，破碎的中國，脫不了水火因緣，我們處於水深火熱之中，難道不想離開它嗎？怒吼吧！中國的人，不要再做水鬼火怪了。</p>

<p>趙自强倒向床上坐着，兩腿分了開來。同時兩手拍了一下，也向外一揚，歎氣道··這件事呌咱們怎樣子幹？一連只借三十塊錢開拔。關耀武笑道··你是把事情看得太鄭重了，所以没有辦法。其實咱們别那樣趨　，只當還駐防在西苑，没有開拔，那麽，就不要錢花了。趙自强道··像你，還有一個家呢，安家費也不要籌辦一點子嗎？關耀武道··要那麽樣子想，這事就没有完了。要是開到通郵政府地方，發了餉，我給他們寄家用回來。若是開到不通郵政的地方，他們只好認命去熬着罷。反正天下也不會餓死多少人。趙自强强笑道··像你這個樣子想法，果然，天下没有什麽了解不下來的事情。不過我就不能那樣子想，我家裏就剩一個六十歲的老爺子呢，能夠讓他熬着嗎？關耀武笑着搖了兩搖頭道··還不光爲了是這個吧？你還有一個心上人呢？趙自强歎了一口氣道··嗐！别提。他將兩隻手的十個指頭，緊緊的互有交叉着揑在一處，把頭低了下去，差不多埀過了胸口。他那番鬱悶壓迫在胸裏，不能說出來情形，比關耀武是更厲害。屋子裏兩個人，一個坐在床上，一個靠了小桌子站定，兩個人也都默然不語。許久許久，關耀忽然昂着頭道··老兄弟，别想，一了百了。咱們拍屁股一走，天坍下來也不問，也就没事了。回連去辦理罷，别胡思亂想了。他說着，也就走過來，輕輕的拍了趙自强幾下肩膀。他是許久也不作聲，最後突然身子一挺，站立起來道··得啦，我信你的了。說着，又歎了一口氣，才轉回連部去。他由這裏下樓，經過殷得仁的樓下，只聽峌那樓窗户裏，放出一種唱戲的低微聲音來··岳大哥，他待我，手足一樣。我王佐，無寸功，怎受榮光。今夜晚，施巧計，番營去闖｀｀｀｀｀｀）（二一八）</p>

<p>— 唐弢</p>
<p>因爲這回全國運動會，居然有遼吉黑三省健兒參加，有些先生便因此舒了口氣，認爲這是好現象。</p>
<p>所謂好現象，這兩年來，着實發現了不少，大槪是國難愈深，好現象也愈多了吧。上海有租界，住之如登天堂，（没錢可不行。）國難决不光臨，然而好現象却也有。</p>
<p>話得從頭講起。大約是國難開始的時候罷，租界裏的華人們也頗曾熱閙過一番。跑上十幾層大厦，朝著東北，高喊（殺！殺！殺！）這是救國，是好現象。商店的門前貼上一張（本號誓不買賣仇貨）的紙條兒··雜誌刋物上登幾篇關於日本的文章·，學生們拉着情人去躺在火車軌道上·，一會兒開會討論，通電出兵，好不熱閙。爲的是要救國，誰敢說不是好現象！</p>
<p>閘北一開火，連身上有些瘡疤的人也變做愛國狂了。據說這是給槍彈打傷的斑痕，曾和日本軍肉搏過的，所以也是好現象。爲著三角失戀，或者窮得不能過活，去借旅館自殺，遺書是（憤外侮之不已，請自殺以報國），也還是好現象　　二年光陰，就在這些好現象裏過去了。如今雜誌刋物上關於日本的文章已經不大看見·，商店門前的紙條早就撕去，却換上（國貨大拍賣）的旗幟·，臥在軌道上的男女學生，辦過湯餅喜筵，趕緊就草離婚聲明·，會雖然還開，除了全運會外，怕只有時裝表演一類的盛典了。這些究竟怎麽了呢？曰··（是救國，是呐喊後的實行，是好現象緊接著好現象）。</p>
<p>然而瘡疤畢竟還是瘡疤，自殺也不復以（報國）聞了。</p>
<p>過去的不想再提，行將過去的可以暫時不提，好現象的製造者要是年青的話，那是還該有未來的。</p>
<h3 id="c283">文選論 <a href="#c283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>— 陳子展</p>
<p>文選這部寳書是不是可以推薦於現代的青年，列爲青年必讀書？你去問詩聖，詩聖說··（熟精文選理！）可惜如今没有這樣的詩聖來向我們青年開這樣的敎訓了。你去問文豪，文豪說··（文選爛，秀才半。可惜如今没有這樣的文豪做主考，來考試我們青年以這樣的文章了。豈天之將喪斯文也？後死者不得與於斯文也？我們不必搖頭，也無須歎氣。爲了珍重（青年文學修養之根基），自然會有人挺身而出，大聲疾呼，（推薦）這部寳書於現你的青年。這是無疑的，讀駢文得讀文選，讀散文得讀莊子。雖無老成人，尙有典型，這兩部書在中國古文學中確是典型之作。何况居然還有少年的老成人，做起白話小說來，也得打開文選，（偶而用山賦及海賦裏的字）？至於有人讀了這類東西，（覺得生澀），這就止怪得他自已（文學修養之根基，）有些缺陷了。</p>
<p>說到正經話，我們旣然是論文選，就應該略略考察這部書的本身。</p>
<p>第一，我們應該知道這部書成於一千四百年前，時代有了許多變遷，文學也有了許多變遷。倘若有人說，這是齊梁時代，（青年文學修養之根基）的一部書，我們當然毫無異議。但若認爲這是現代青年在交學修養上必讀之書，我們雖不說什麽，可是這部書的選集者蕭統，地下有靈，他一定發宣言，打通電來反對的。即算他地下無靈，還有他的遺文可以考見他的主張，在文選序裏他不是說過文章宜（隨時改變）嗎？所以在齊梁之際，駢儷之文最盛的時代，他纔選集了這部以沈思翰藻爲宗旨的書，連經史諸子之文也都不入選。要是他生在今日，或許要編一部新文選，他一定不會再來一部文選那樣的書，作爲（青年文學修養之根基。）因爲他是知道文章宜（隨時改變，）他不會呌人開倒車的呀！</p>
<p>第二，我們要知道蕭統最一個（監撫餘閑，居多暇日，歷觀文囿，泛覽辭林一的太子。他編這部文選，算是那個時代貴族文學的模範讀本。如今我們說的貴族文學，他們呌做宮體。據說宮體之名，是蕭綱立的。因爲蕭統死了。他做了太子。他和那些供奉宮廷的文人的領袖徐摛庾肩吾，作舊文好爲新變，不拘舊體，當時那些供奉宮廷的文人都學他們，宮體之號由此而起。蕭綱自已也說··（余七歲有詩癖，憂而不倦。然傷於輕豔，號曰宮體。）我們要知道蕭統蕭綱兄弟在文學上的主張是一樣的，就是文學是（隨時改變）的，所以（好爲新變），他們反對復古。蕭綱說··（未聞吟詠情性，反擬内則之篇··操筆寫志，更摹酒誥之作。遲遲春日，翻學歸藏·，湛湛江水，遂同大傳。）　這樣說來，文選這部書的性質，及其選集者的主張，我們大略可以清楚。難道生在今日的我們，除了一千四百年前貴族階級認爲時髦的文選，就没有一部可以作爲（青年文學修養之根基）的書？</p>
<p>第三，我們要知道敎人（參悟一點做文章的方法）去讀文選，這也要呌疑古玄同稚暉老人笑脫下巴的。有誰能夠證明現代中國有名的作家，他們做文章的方法是從文選那部書得來？疑古玄同痛駡過（文選妖孽），他看見了文選，說不定來一把硫黄火。稚暉老人作文，以（放屁放屁，眞正豈有此理）之精神行之，他這種精神說是得自一部何典。他老人家看見了文選，說不定要丢進毛厠坑。何况他老人家還曾主張過要把中國的線裝書通通丢在毛厠坑裏三十年再說呢！至於說是讀了文選，（可以擴大一點字彚），這也不盡然。除了其中死字不算，究意有多少活字可以移植到現代人的現代文？除了遺老遺少的古體文不算，有誰看見現代人的現代文有多少字彚是出自文選？而且這些字彚還是新鮮活潑的？難道現代的作家，都是（文章太拙直，字彚太小）嗎？</p>
<p>很（拙直）地說來，不覺太長了，就此（带住）。</p>

<p>— 高植</p>
<p>全國運動大會的會場在中山陵的南邊，從城内大行宮有江南長途汽車公司的汽車直達大會塲的大門。第一天是雙十節，看（會）的人太多，爲着搶車，便打毁了汽車十餘輛，無秩序的精神有過於火車站與輪船碼頭。汽車公司裏的人員罷工，要去也祇得作罷。後來汽車復工，便决定了去看看。</p>
<p>上汽車時是一陣擁擠，許多白髮的老頭兒也會（擁擠）向前。坐在車上又是擁擠。旣然是擠上了車，有的人連車票也不用買了，南京話是（揩油），在揩油上不後人的是穿西裝的人。下了汽車，買入場票時是擠，然揩油與擁擠（雙軌同進），許多人入會塲的鐵門時就一擁而進，自然無庸買票。會塲内仍然是擠，若說（無秩序）是國粹之一，諒不會錯，隨處都有牠的表現。</p>
<p>在看台上坐下時，我聽到放音機裏發出來的話聲是呌塲内的人走出去，不要妨礙運動，可是那些太太少奶奶却時時在場上走來走去，於是放音機裏呌了又呌，（閑人站出塲外去）！</p>
<p>看台上時時有人跑來跑去，有的連麵包水壸全带入塲，看會與野餐並進，於是地上有水有廢物了。有時一羣人向這里一跑，向那里一擠，在跑與擠時，雙脚便什麽也不管，把乾凈的坐位踏上了許多泥印。於是後面的觀衆又呌前面的（坐下呀！坐下呀！）</p>
<p>會場裏維持秩序不可缺少兵。看台上若有兵便是一大羣。但與觀衆常常發生衝突，觀衆祇聽到許多兵高聲大喊（打打打！）軍人打仗的精神在會塲上大出風頭了。</p>
<p>在會塲上的女人都極力打扮得花花綠綠，各種各樣被内政部所禁止的（奇裝怪服）這里全有，這個自動的時裝表演的確比少數名媛閨秀臨時穿幾件時髦的國貨衣服在台上轉幾轉有趣。平常要觀這末多的（高等女人）是不容易的，在大會塲上却可看見許多氣派十足的男子带着女兒般的或孫女般的年青愛人走來走去，而許多（不相干）的女人在運動塲上走來走去，許多非（高等）的人便知逛夫了廟般地來看人看熱閙了。他們是頂會擠的，有時童子軍祇得大聲呌道，（有力的去擠男人，不要擠女人）。</p>
<p>人多車少，下午四時起便大家擠在汽車站前搶着買票，擁擠復擁擠，實在不敢（搶上前去）只得搭大卡車像裝貨般被裝進城來了。警察加多了，每個車上都有（武裝同志）壓車，竟有（竟想不到之效力），不再打壞車輛了。</p>
<p>想到國粹問題，覺得（無秩序）是不能免的。</p>

<p>陸醉米太太是一個金髮製服的女人，輕　一圈，無論怎樣微細的風皆可以吹起。小小的臉孔現得果斷，勇敢，好戰，和她那優淑的氣質全不相稱。</p>
<p>因爲性情相似的緣故，兩人裏面，她早像中意了哲安。可是這種偏向只表示在那幾乎覺察不出的聲音和眼色的差異裡面，並且她有時接受他的意見，也只在眼色裡面看得出來。她似乎猜到哲安的意見可以使得他自已的更加堅来起來，而筆爾的意見則無可避免的一定和她的不同。當她談到醫生的思想，他的政治，藝術，哲學，倫理等等的思想時，她有時說着（你那些無稽的事情。）於是，他便以一種司法官的冷酷的眼光瞧着她，彷佛在預審着女人的訴訟，一切女人們的訴訟，這些可憐的東西啊！</p>
<p>羅蘭老爹在兩個兒子没有回家的時候，曾没有邀她一同去釣魚過，並且他也曾没有把自已女人带去過，原因是他歡喜在黎明以前同博齊汝船長和帕帕格里老水手一同出發。博齊汝船長是一個退職的航海家，漲潮的時候在埠頭上碰見了而成爲密友的·，帕帕格里老水手則綽號眞巴（Ｊｅａｎ－Ｂａｒｔ１６５０－１７０２著名海賊）·替他擔任看船的職務。</p>

<p>Unarmed Soldiers Arrive in Succession at the Baoding Military Sub-Council, Claiming Non-Acceptance</p>
<p>Many from Fang's Faction Have Deserted; Four Gates of Beiping Strengthened with Guards</p>
<p>(Beiping) Military Dispatch: Unarmed soldiers from Fang's faction arrived in full force in Baoding last night. More than ten members of Ji's faction left Shahe at 10:00 this morning, taking the Ping-Sui train to Xizhimen, then transferring to the Ping-Han Railway to Baoding. In the Shahe area, there are still mixed troops from Wang Ying and others, who will also arrive at the Ping-Han Line successively this afternoon. It is expected that all the unarmed soldiers from various factions will reach Baoding tonight. It is said that the handling method has been decided: dispersal and repatriation to their native places. As for the whereabouts of Fang himself, there have been many rumors lately, but the truth cannot be verified at the moment. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A spokesperson for the Military Sub-Council stated that this time Fang Ji raised troops and caused chaos, disturbing the local areas. Villages and towns were completely looted wherever they went. Judging from the losses suffered by the people in the Pingbei area, the damage is incalculable. Now that Fang Ji is at the end of his rope and has fled in fear of punishment, most of his officers and soldiers are a motley crew, lacking discipline and deeply corrupted. If they were to be accepted, it would cause future troubles. Therefore, all of them will be disarmed and dismissed, and not a single person will be accepted. The procedures for disarming and repatriation have been completed in recent days. The Fang Ji problem, which has been delayed for more than a month, can now be considered completely resolved. This kind of handling shows that the government will not show any leniency towards those who rebel against the party and disrupt the country. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After receiving reports that many of Fang Ji's remnants had deserted en route, fearing that they would flee into the city, Wang Shuchang, the Beiping-Tianjin Garrison Commander, strictly ordered the joint military and police office to strengthen defenses at the four gates of Xizhi, Desheng, Anding, and Dongzhi starting today, and to send guards to inspect pedestrians entering the city. Today, a dozen soldiers from Fang Ji's faction have been arrested and sent to the Garrison Headquarters for interrogation. (20th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) The defeated general Ji Hongchang fled to his residence in the French Concession of Tianjin on the 16th night, keeping a low profile. However, there has been no sign of Fang Zhenwu entering Tianjin to this day. After thorough investigation, it was unexpectedly discovered that he was captured by Guan Linzheng's troops near Sunjia Town while trying to escape and executed on the spot. It was found that he attempted to flee to Tianjin by car late at night on the 16th. En route, near Sunjia Town, he was intercepted by the 15th Division of Guan Linzheng's troops, who disarmed his guards. At that time, Fang's guards resisted, and the two sides exchanged fire. Ji Hongchang took the opportunity to escape and safely fled to Tianjin. However, Fang Zhenwu was surrounded and bombarded, hit by stray bullets, and died on the spot.

There is no preparation for this in current Japanese negotiations. In the future, each pass of the Great Wall will be temporarily guarded by Japanese troops to prevent bandits from fleeing. The Administrative Inspectorate of the War Zone is expected to be officially established next month. (20th Dispatch)</p>

The bandits in Liushouying fled upon hearing the news. The security team surrounded three or four hundred bandits hiding in the Beidaihe area and captured seven at the East Station of Beidaihe and executed them on the spot.

<p>(Beiping) Sun Dianying's troops are heading west to Qinghai and planned to pass through Ningxia. Grain and supplies have already entered the Dengkou area within Ningxia territory. Subsequently, Ma Hongkui, following Zhu Shaoliang's order, forbade Sun's army from passing. Sun withdrew the supplies to Datang, a place between Dengkou and Linhe, and stopped there to await orders. It is rumored that the central government plans to transfer Sun's army to Xinjiang to consolidate border defenses. It is currently telegraphing various parties to discuss this matter. Ma Hongkui sent a telegram to Beiping yesterday, stating that since the appointment of Sun as the director of reclamation in western Qinghai, he has not received an order from the central government to allow passage through Ningxia along a designated route. Recently, he received a telegram from Director Zhu Jiang stating that no military stations should be established within the three provinces' territories, and that requisitioning grain and carts should be strictly prohibited, and severe measures should be taken if they occur. Kui's duty is to act in accordance with his responsibilities, but he does not know what to do. If unfortunately a war breaks out, the entire country may not understand. He has telegraphed the central government, requesting permission to resign from all concurrent posts to apologize to the people of the country. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Sun Dianying's representative, Hu Jiesan, said that Sun had already sent a telegram to Ma Hongkui, explaining that his troops had not crossed Dengkou and are currently about 100 li away from that place.

They will advance when the central government orders them to advance, and they will retreat when the central government orders them to retreat. He received a telegram yesterday, repeatedly stating that he would not cause a civil war because of this matter and has already submitted it to Lin, Wang, and Jiang for instructions on everything. Wang is quite interested in transferring Sun's troops to Xinjiang. He himself will go to Baotou in a week to meet Sun. (20th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Colonel Okamura's arrival in Beiping is not yet certain. Arita, the Chinese counselor who came to Beiping with Ariyoshi, said that matters concerning postal services between Manchukuo and North China, the opening of traffic between Beiping and Shenyang, and the handover of each pass of the Great Wall are all within the spirit of the truce agreement and should be handled by the Kwantung Army. The ambassador has no mission to discuss with Huang. Ambassador Ariyoshi also did not receive instructions from Foreign Minister Hirota before coming to Beiping. Japan will still discuss diplomatic events in North China with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at any time. Foreign Minister Hirota's policy towards China remains consistent. Although relations between Japan and Russia are tense, both sides will not develop into a rupture. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After Japanese Ambassador Ariyoshi arrived in Beiping from Shanghai last night, he visited Jingshan with his wife and others this afternoon. He is scheduled to visit Huang He within a few days. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Ambassador Ariyoshi's arrival in Beiping at this time has naturally attracted the attention of the general public. Chinese newspapers expect that after the Japanese ambassador visits Chinese and foreign dignitaries, he will discuss various North China negotiations with Huang Fu, such as the future of Yuguan, the return of each pass of the Great Wall, and railway transportation. Rumors have spread in recent days that China and Japan will hold direct negotiations, but the newspapers believe that the talks between the Japanese ambassador and Huang Fu will be limited to urgent issues. However, once these issues are resolved, relations between the two countries can be improved, and direct negotiations will also be possible. Japanese personnel here do not pay much attention to Ariyoshi's arrival in Beiping, saying that the Japanese ambassador has not visited North China for a year, and this time he will not open negotiations with Huang Fu, because most of the unresolved issues at present are military in nature and will be handled by the military authorities when negotiations begin in the future. Japanese personnel think the talk of negotiation is premature. (20th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e21">Germany Formally Notifies Withdrawal from the League <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>France and Germany Increase Mistrust; Efforts to Salvage Disarmament Exhausted</p>
<p>Using the Four-Power Pact to Seek Compromise; Disarmament Chairman Expresses Disapproval</p>
<p>(Geneva) News from Berlin: The German government has already sent a formal notification of its withdrawal from the League of Nations, but the League Secretariat had not received it as of tonight. This move by the Germans is sufficient to show their determination to implement the policy announced last Saturday. Therefore, the current diplomatic efforts should seek some understanding on the disarmament issue. People in the League of Nations all expect that the German notification of withdrawal from the League of Nations may not contain anything surprising, but will only make a brief statement in accordance with the provisions of the Covenant. How it is exactly will become clear once the German document arrives. News from Berlin also said that the German government will publish the full text after confirming that the League of Nations has received it.</p>
<p>Currently, politicians from various countries are trying to find a basis for a turnaround, so that the Germans can consider returning to the Disarmament Conference. Someone suggested that the signatory countries of the Four-Power Pact act as agents of the Disarmament Conference, but Disarmament Chairman Motterson did not approve it, stating today that this procedure will further confuse other representatives and tend to breed suspicion, fearing that it will have a huge harm to the Disarmament Conference and the Four-Power Pact. The pact is indeed valuable in seeking to facilitate agreement within the League of Nations, but it should not be used as an attempt to get the Germans to return to the Disarmament Conference. (19th National Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Geneva) It has recently been heard that no suggestion to persuade Germany to return to the Disarmament Conference is actually feasible. Therefore, some representatives now believe that the Disarmament Conference may continue to adjourn for some time after October 26. Since Germany itself has made no proposals recently, its only action is to send a formal notification of withdrawal from the League of Nations. Although this move seeks to make its withdrawal from the League and the Disarmament Conference a simple matter, it is feared that it will still fail to promote its return to the Conference with a simple proposal. Chairman Henderson still believes that a way can eventually be found to get the Germans to rejoin disarmament, but recognizes that this matter should be conducted completely separately from returning to the League of Nations. Therefore, the representatives are all hoping that France can provide some practical plans for reducing the army. It is said that before the German representative withdrew from the conference last Saturday, he stated that if the French could agree to a plan to reduce their armaments within a reasonable short period, then Germany would accept the draft proposal to inspect armaments. However, if France only allows a certain reduction within four years, then Germany would have no choice but to abandon it. Whether France can agree to shorten this period to several months is not known, but most representatives today said that the German withdrawal has made it impossible for France to make concessions. Although France is still prepared to join any movement to get a respite in terms of armaments, its suspicion has increased due to the German withdrawal. (29th National Telegraph)</p>

<p>(Geneva) League of Nations Deputy Secretary-General, German General Trenenburg, received a notice from Secretary-General Avenol today, stating that he should resign immediately after Germany formally notifies its withdrawal from the League of Nations, because his position as Deputy Secretary-General is purely political, not a civil service position. Therefore, Trenenburg has decided to leave the Secretariat immediately. (20th National Telegraph)</p>

<p>(Berlin) The wording printed on the ballots for the re-election of the House of Representatives on November 11 was originally as follows: (Does the German people approve of the policies specified in the Central Government's announcement of October 14, 1933? (That is, withdrawal from the League of Nations and the Disarmament Conference), and are they prepared to declare that this policy is an expression of the people's will and solemnly support this policy?) This wording has now been modified to replace it with the following wording: (Do the German men and women people not approve of the government's policy? Are you prepared to declare that this is an expression of your personal opinion and will? Are you prepared to solemnly support this policy?) According to this revision, it is not only in the words, but also focuses on the content of the government's policy. The original wording specifically referred to the government's announcement on October 14 of this year, and the referendum expressed approval or disapproval. After this revision, the referendum refers not only to this announcement, but also to the entire policy of the Hitler government. (20th Havas Dispatch)</p>

Hitler reiterated that Germany's demand for absolute equality, and Germany will no longer participate in international conferences one day unless the great powers unconditionally recognize it. Hitler expressed his friendship with Britain, saying that Germany's attitude towards France is always determined by France's attitude towards Germany. Germany never wants to start a dispute with France, and sincerely wishes to establish a true understanding with France on the basis of national dignity and self-esteem. Hitler strongly denied that the training of German youth contains military purposes, and pointed out that rumors that Germany has established armories in the Netherlands, Sweden, and other countries are deliberate smears. Furthermore, as for the problems of the Polish Corridor and former German colonies, they must be retained for international negotiations. Germany has no one who is willing to go to war over the Corridor issue. Germany hopes that the two countries will discuss this matter thoroughly. He claimed that the Treaty of Versailles also allowed Germany to propose amendments to the clauses regarding this issue. (19th National Telegraph)</p>

The report said, "If a system of automatic arms inspection on a regular basis can be applied to all countries, Germany is prepared to acknowledge this. This has been stated by Germany. However, the lack of sincerity in disarmament in various countries has made this plan impossible to implement.

<p>Rome: Mussolini's Italian "People's Newspaper" today vehemently attacked Archduke Otto von Habsburg, the self-proclaimed heir to Austria. This suggests that Italy is unlikely to support the restoration of the Habsburg monarchy. The matter arose from a letter written by the Archduke rejecting Fascism and demanding the return of South Tyrol, which was ceded to Italy after the Great War. The newspaper commented that it is difficult to expect relics of the old era to understand a new ideology like Fascism, but Otto should know that without Italy's support, his grapes will ultimately be sour.

Japan is invading and annexing the territory of neighboring countries and massacring the Chinese people in an extremely shameful way. The essence of its imperialism can be summarized in numbers, namely (might makes right). (19th, Havas telegram)</p>

<p>(London) The general sense of anxiety caused by recent developments in Geneva and elsewhere in Europe can be seen in the active measures taken by European governments to strengthen their border defenses to prevent unexpected actions. The Belgian government has continued to allocate funds for border defenses to ensure that foreign enemies cannot invade.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, heavy troops are now stationed behind the barbed wire on Austria's northern border, and defensive works are being rushed.</p>
<p>Northeast France now has deep trenches, fortifications, and heavy troops, forming a strong line. French Prime Minister Daladier stated that France's defenses are not yet complete and that the military budget should not be interfered with due to economic issues when it is submitted for approval. This statement is noteworthy.</p>
<p>Poland also feels uneasy about the situation. Today, someone spoke in parliament, saying that Poland will never give up the Polish Corridor without a fight. This statement was met with cheers from the entire audience.</p>
<p>A Czech official expressed the Czech government's opinion, saying that as far as Czechoslovakia is concerned, any anti-war treaty can only be concluded with military strength.</p>

<p>(London) The movement to expand British naval strength is progressing daily, and its momentum is increasing daily. Lord Beatty, who served as Commander-in-Chief of the Navy for ten years before and after the European War and established extraordinary achievements in the Battle of Jutland, delivered a speech at a naval association banquet today, saying that the idea of "splendid isolation" is nothing more than a pipe dream. If we want to participate in European affairs, it is necessary to maintain naval power. He also said that "At this moment, we cannot ignore European continental affairs. If we want to participate effectively, we must rely on naval power. Therefore, our country's foreign policy must be backed by naval power." (20th, Havas telegram)</p>
<p>(London) Fleet Commander Earl Beatty said in a speech at the Naval Association tonight that the weaknesses of the British Navy must be corrected at the 1935 naval conference. Britain has restored its credibility, but at great risk. Britain urgently needs seventy cruisers, and even with the new ones built by 1936, the number will not exceed fifty at most. Furthermore, the number of British naval personnel has been reduced too much. The United States currently has one hundred seven thousand people, an increase of more than sixty percent compared to 1914. Japan currently has eighty-eight thousand people, an increase of seventy-four percent compared to 1914, while Britain currently has ninety thousand people, a decrease of thirty-five percent. The British Navy's maintenance cost is 43,000,000 British pounds, while the United States' is 75,000,000 British pounds. Beatty did not want to criticize the United States regarding cruisers or to demand equal terms, but he said that Britain's acceptance of fifty ships without insisting on more was a regrettable mistake.

Reuters learned from reliable sources that the above news was completely untrue. All that is happening is that a volunteer reserve force is currently being organized. Hong Kong will organize a naval week from October 28th, the method of which is the same as British naval week. As for the movements of British warships, the 10,000-ton cruiser "Cornwall" is about to return to England, and the aircraft carrier "Eagle" is stationed in Chinese waters only to free up the aircraft carrier "Hermes" so that it can undergo repairs.

<h3 id="e35">US Naval League Defends Government Plan <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) The US Naval League, upon hearing that British Foreign Secretary Simon had suggested slightly modifying the US shipbuilding plan, today sent a letter to the British Naval League, defending the US plan and providing a straightforward explanation of the US position in the Pacific. It stated that at the 1921 Washington Conference, the United States, believing that Japan's signing of the Nine-Power Treaty would guarantee the open door and integrity of China, resolutely abandoned the right to establish suitable naval bases in the Pacific and to improve defenses in ports in the Philippines and elsewhere. The Americans hoped that this action would make Japan believe that the United States was truly friendly. However, this sacrifice did not seem to have achieved a corresponding concession from other countries. In view of these facts, the League believes that it is unwise for the United States to maintain its original position. In addition, it cited statistics to show that the United States, after completing its current shipbuilding program, is still 200,000 tons short of the limits set by the London Treaty. The League has always advocated a large navy, so the letter did not ask the United Kingdom to reduce its naval strength, but only defended the US plan based on the current situation in the Pacific. It should be noted that although the League is a non-official organization and cannot represent US government policy, it has considerable influence in shaping public opinion.

<p>(Paris) The American Seamen's Association sent a letter to the French Seamen's Association, speaking gently and firmly, roughly saying that there is a risk of another world war breaking out. The two Anglo-Saxon countries should originally support each other to prevent it. The world's democratic politics and the position of the white race in the world also depend on the two countries supporting each other. However, British politicians have adopted an opposing attitude towards the United States' move to strengthen its naval power, believing that there will be no war between Britain and the United States. But since they oppose the United States' strengthening its naval power, they must have the idea of war in their minds, and when the United States goes to war with a third country, Britain may remain neutral and have no intention of cooperating with the United States. However, (Britain's strategy of restricting the British Navy is certainly not welcomed by the United States, and the result will only be failure). (20th, Havas telegram)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Today's Five-Minister Conference was held at the Prime Minister's residence at 2:00 PM. Prime Minister Saito wanted to conclude the conference today, so he invited Chief Secretary Horikiri at 8:40 AM to discuss the procedures for preparing a memorandum. The military, because Army Minister Araki had obtained the support of the Military Advisory Council, was increasingly confident. Navy Minister Osumi had also obtained the understanding of Marshal Togo and military officials such as Kato. Therefore, the atmosphere was tense from the beginning of the conference. As a result, apart from some disagreements, the cabinet members found points of agreement on abstract foreign and defense policies. In the future, only the remaining details will be reviewed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Army and Navy. In short, it ended satisfactorily. If there are no special waves, the memorandum on the fundamental principles will be emphasized. At tomorrow's extraordinary cabinet meeting, Prime Minister Saito will report to the cabinet members and request their understanding. The meeting adjourned at 3:50 PM. At 4:10 PM, Chief Secretary Horikiri issued the following statement: As a result of discussions on national defense, diplomacy, and the economy at the Five-Minister Conference, mutual understanding was deepened, and agreement was reached on general principles.</p>

Navy Minister Osumi said that the decisions on national defense, diplomacy, and finance will be reported to the Prime Minister after the Grand Maneuvers. The Five-Minister Conference was a very good conference because it was an important conference, so every word and sentence was tense. Finance Minister Takahashi also said that opinions were agreed upon amid laughter.

<h3 id="e46">Current Commentary: Reflections on the Import of Japanese Aged Rice <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Japan's new grain harvest is abundant, and aged rice stocks have reached over 11 million stones this year, not including the surpluses in Korea and Taiwan. Therefore, 50,000 bags of aged rice are being dumped in our country. Each bag contains 150 pounds, and its price is only 6.3 yuan. We do not want to use excessively emotional or inflammatory language here. Considering our country as an agricultural nation, it relies solely on agricultural products to offset the import of foreign goods in terms of international balance of payments. However, in recent years, our country's handicraft products, such as porcelain and lacquerware, have been declining daily. The silk industry has also plummeted. Even if our political capabilities are comparable to those of the great powers, this kind of excessive import leakage is enough to cause extremely serious economic consequences. Moreover, in the past six months, the import of foreign rice, foreign wheat, and other miscellaneous grains has reached over 100 million. The impact on rural areas is self-evident.</p>
<p>Japan is a late-developing industrial nation. The agricultural population accounts for only about 60% of the total population. Its domestic agricultural food and raw materials are insufficient to meet its needs. This has always been the case. Moreover, after the global economic panic and frenzy struck, Japan was also inevitably plunged into a state of recession. However, because it is a light industrial nation and has not completely shed its agricultural production form, it has suffered less damage than other countries. In addition, the Japanese militarists have always regarded war preparation as the way to solve all problems, stimulating general production through military industry. In agriculture, they only aim for self-sufficiency. As a result, the theory of controlling rice has recently resurfaced. Overproduction of rice and market stagnation have led to an excess of stock. Because of excessive stock, rice prices cannot help but fall. The amount of the fall has even gone below the cost of production, and the hardship of rural areas is becoming even more severe. According to the current rural economic situation in Japan, the total debt of farmers has reached 7 billion yen. Each farmer is in debt for more than 1,000 yen.</p>
<p>Not only is rural finance exhausted and there is no way to borrow money, but some people are even filling their stomachs with miscellaneous grains, unable to get a full meal. On the other hand, although there is prosperity in the military industry in the cities, it cannot reverse the decline of the entire society. Therefore, unemployed people have nowhere to turn, and overseas immigration has become a mere fantasy. (This economic panic is global. The East experienced the panic later, but the damage is more profound. Therefore, it is not easy for overseas Chinese businesses to stabilize.) The unemployed population in large cities cannot be relocated abroad and cannot help but flow back into the countryside, making the rural areas even more unstable. This situation is reflected in the entire society. Therefore, so-called radical ideas have infiltrated the sharpening of extreme militarism. Conflicting contradictions have formed the current situation in Japan.</p>
<p>The Japanese warlords, at this critical juncture, are not only unwilling to give up their military policies, but are becoming increasingly tense. Strengthening land equipment, supplementing naval power, building steel plants, and controlling grain are all being planned. This sale of aged rice was originally rice stored in Japanese government warehouses for military use during wartime. Now, partly because the time has been long and they fear it will spoil, and partly because of the abundant agricultural harvest, they are taking the opportunity to replace it. Therefore, this sale of aged rice by Japan is superficially only a kind of dumping, but in reality, it contains serious military implications.</p>
<p>Since our China is an agricultural nation, it cannot be like the countries of the Americas supplying the world with food, but at least it should be self-sufficient, so that the people have no hunger. However, in recent decades, rural areas have gradually declined. Coastal cities such as Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Tianjin all rely on foreign rice and foreign wheat for their livelihood. Even small and medium-sized cities along the Yangtze River and the coast rely on imported food. This situation may not be a cause for concern in peacetime, but in today's uncertain world political situation, with the serious confrontation between Germany and France in Europe, the irreconcilable relationship between Germany and Italy, the intense economic competition between Britain and Japan in the Far East, the start of the naval arms race between Japan and the United States, and the increasingly deteriorating relationship between Japan and the Soviet Union, we are in a difficult position. Given the current tense situation and the weakness of our own strength, the issue of people's food is also very important to our self-defense and must be planned in advance.</p>

<h3 id="e47">Past Work and Future Directions of the National Economic Council <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>

<p>First Plenary Meeting to be Held Next Week</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Economic Council was formally established on October 5th and has been actively carrying out various tasks. It has also established the Cotton Industry Control Committee as a prelude to the implementation of economic control. Song Ziwen, a standing committee member of the council, has arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai. The first plenary meeting of the committee is scheduled to be held next week. A reporter from the Central News Agency, recognizing that the work of the council is urgently needed following its establishment, visited a responsible person of the council on the 20th to inquire about the council's past work and future directions. A brief summary of the information is as follows: In the autumn of the 20th year of the Republic of China, the National Government established the National Economic Council to promote economic construction and improve the people's livelihood. The council was intended to be the central hub for coordinating, designing, and implementing national economic construction plans, with the aim of promptly realizing urgent and important construction or reconstruction projects. However, given the magnitude and complexity of the matter, careful deliberation and planning were deemed necessary. Therefore, in November of the 20th year of the Republic of China, a preparatory office was first established to handle all preparatory matters related to the National Economic Council and to act as the secretariat before the full council was established. However, shortly after its establishment, the country was beset by internal and external troubles. In addition to the ravages of floods, foreign aggression followed, and the disturbances of the Communist bandits were particularly harmful, resulting in huge expenditures of national resources. Furthermore, the impact of the global economic downturn was felt, and the domestic economy repeatedly experienced panic. All of these factors undermined political stability and hindered the progress of planned work. Nevertheless, even in this difficult period, the council was able to adhere to its original purpose and strive to engage in various construction projects, laying the foundation for the permanent organization of the council. This is truly commendable. At the time of its establishment, Chiang Kai-shek, the President of the Executive Yuan, served as the Chairman of the council, and Song Ziwen, the Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, served as the Vice Chairman. Heads of relevant economic construction departments of the central government, as well as leaders from various industrial and economic sectors, served as committee members. After its establishment, the preparatory office was ordered to convene the first committee meeting. Subsequently, the directions set by this meeting were implemented separately in various projects. Based on the needs of project implementation, five specialized committees were established successively for highways, engineering, health, education, and rural development, as well as three institutions: the Highway Bureau, the Engineering Bureau, and the Central Hygiene Facilities Experimental Bureau. These committees and bureaus were able to fulfill their duties in researching, recommending, implementing, and supervising various economic construction matters, serving as an arm of the government. Furthermore, they were established separately based on established directions and have already taken initial shape. The organizational structure of the technical organs of the National Economic Council was largely completed during the preparatory period. The original organizational structure during the preparatory period is illustrated in the attached diagram. The work during the preparatory period can be summarized as follows: (1) Highways: Recognizing that the development of transportation is a prerequisite for solving all economic problems in China, the council began to supervise the construction of inter-provincial highways in May of the 21st year of the Republic of China. At the same time, it raised road construction funds and allocated loans on a regular basis to supplement the insufficient road construction funds in various provinces. The inter-provincial highways planned and supervised by the Highway Bureau of the council include two major systems: the inter-provincial highways of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, and the inter-provincial highways of Henan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Hunan provinces. The construction cost of the three-province highways was budgeted at a total of 3,199,000 yuan, and the construction cost of the seven-province highways was estimated at approximately 10,000,000 yuan. The three-province highway system includes six connecting highways, of which the Nanjing-Hangzhou, Shanghai-Hangzhou, Nanjing-Wuhu, Suzhou-Jiashan, and Changxing-Yixing lines have been completed and opened to traffic. Only the Hangzhou-Huizhou road is facing more difficult construction, but it is expected to be completed by the end of October this year. The seven-province highway system is over 22,000 kilometers long, of which 2,000 kilometers have been completed. As a result, over 8,000 kilometers of highways can be connected and interconnected. In addition to supervising the construction of highways in various provinces, the work of the Highway Bureau includes the construction of test roads with various types of pavements, the training of highway engineering personnel, the compilation of highway dictionaries, and the investigation and research on road construction materials, transportation, surveying, highway construction costs, and oil mines in Sichuan Province. (2) Water Conservancy Projects: China is an agricultural country, and droughts and floods are the greatest harm to the people's livelihood. The council recognized the importance of river works and water conservancy. In the past, water conservancy work was mostly focused on relief efforts, the completion of unfinished projects transferred by the Flood Relief Committee, or the establishment of engineering bureaus for implementation. It engaged in the reinforcement and heightening of the main dikes of the Yangtze, Huai, Han, and Gan rivers to prevent floods, the installation of numerous culverts along the Huai River dikes for irrigation, the dredging of the rivers in the Lixiahe area to discharge the water from the Grand Canal into the Huai River, and the construction of tidal gates at Doulonggang and Hebei River to prevent the backflow of seawater tides and to promote irrigation and navigation. In addition, it selected important locations along the Yellow, Luo, Sha, and Ying rivers in Henan Province to construct dikes, bridges, revetments, etc., to protect the farmland and residences of hundreds of thousands of residents along the river from flood disasters. During April and May of this year, the water level of the Yangtze River began to rise. The Engineering Bureau immediately began preparations for dike protection and flood prevention. By the end of June, the river water suddenly reached the highest level in the same month in recent years, and in some places, it was only one foot lower than the flood level in the 20th year of the Republic of China. The areas along the Yangtze River felt uneasy. Fortunately, the dikes built by the Flood Relief Committee last year had been maintained and repaired by the Engineering Bureau according to plan, and the flood disaster of the 20th year of the Republic of China was avoided from recurring today. (3) Hubei Dike Works and Dike Funds: The government, considering that the original competent authority for water conservancy dike works in Hubei Province was ineffective, transferred the responsibility to the council in November of the 21st year of the Republic of China. The council immediately supervised the Jianghan Engineering Bureau to complete over 100 annual maintenance projects within four months. It also established definite measures for dike inspection and flood prevention preparation to cope with emergencies. As for the Hubei Dike Works Special Fund Management Committee established by the council, its achievements were also quite remarkable. Its receipts and expenditures showed a surplus that was used for new and permanent water conservancy projects in Hubei Province. This year, a portion of it was used to implement the Jinshui Gate Construction Project, which had been designed for a long time but had not yet been started. Jinshui is a tributary of the Yangtze River. The Yangtze River water level is usually higher in summer than in winter, with a difference of about 50 feet. As a result, the tributary floods are a disaster, and the land on both sides becomes a swamp, especially Jinshui. Once this long-delayed gate construction project is completed, hundreds of thousands of acres of farmland can be protected. (4) Public Health: The organization of public health agencies was the beginning of technical cooperation between our country and the League of Nations. The former Ministry of Health had agreed on a plan with the Health Organization of the League of Nations, the most important of which was the establishment of the Central Hygiene Facilities Experimental Bureau. The bureau was established in the 18th year of the Republic of China. In the 21st year of the Republic of China, it was transferred to the National Economic Council. It engaged in the experimentation of various hygiene facilities and cooperated with various local governments to promote the establishment of all hygiene undertakings. It assisted the local governments of Hangzhou, Nanjing, and Shanghai in setting up various environmental hygiene matters. It also curbed the prevalence of cholera and other epidemics in various places in the 21st year of the Republic of China. It conducted malaria surveys and eradication plans in Nanjing and the Yangtze River area. In the 22nd year of the Republic of China, it cooperated with the Highway Bureau to establish six highway hygiene groups in various provinces, paying attention to protecting the health of workers, travelers, and the public. In addition, it established a rural hygiene facilities experimental area in Tangshan to promote the experimentation of rural hygiene work. It also used domestic materials to formulate medicines, researching their functions in preparation for recovering rights. At the same time, it cooperated with various local government groups to promote public health education, school hygiene, and maternal and child hygiene undertakings. It also set up various training courses within the bureau to train various hygiene administrative and technical personnel. As for the disaster area hygiene facilities that were jointly handled with the Flood Relief Committee in the 20th year of the Republic of China, they achieved particularly good results. (5) Sericulture: Regarding sericulture, sericulture experimental areas were set up in Hangzhou and Jurong, and the Nanjing, Xiaoshan, and Jintan sericulture experimental areas were assisted in conducting silkworm breeding experiments for the improvement of original Italian hybrid and local varieties. Guidance stations were set up in the experimental areas to guide farmers in various feeding methods. Although the silkworm breeding work encountered difficulties due to unfavorable weather and environment, the results were still satisfactory. In total, approximately 27,000 households benefited. (9) Rural Development: Rural development is an important issue at present. The council has focused on rural economic cooperatives and rural relief. Regarding rural economy, meticulous investigations have been conducted on farmland, rural population, land distribution, land rent, rural credit, and the main agricultural products, including their production, export, import, consumption, transportation, and improvement. Regarding rural cooperatives, various relevant materials have been collected for reference, and various research questions have been drafted. The opinions of specialists are being solicited. Once the solicitations are completed, planning and implementation can be carried out. As for rural relief undertakings, the council took over the rural relief affairs transferred by the Flood Relief Committee in June of this year. It is currently engaged in clearing up the original work of the committee as a reference for future planning. As for the experts from the League of Nations for technical cooperation who came to China, such as the International Education Inspection Group for education who came to China to investigate the Chinese education system. The members of the group included Mr. Pei Kelang, Ziwen, Tang Nahuaersiji, Huaerde Hengli Pinna, and Shadi. After completing the investigation, they wrote a book entitled "Improvement of Chinese Education" and drafted a preliminary plan for reforming Chinese education. Pan Lier, Gao Desi, Weijing, and others in the field of engineering came to China to study water conservancy, land reclamation, and flood prevention issues. Aojinji in the field of highways, Budeli in the field of water conservancy, and Bao Xize in the field of hygiene were stationed at the Highway Bureau, the Engineering Bureau, and the Central Hygiene Facilities Experimental Bureau, respectively, to assist in the work at any time. Mr. Telaigongni and Mr. Boli in the field of agricultural economics stayed in China for half a year to assist in the study of rural economic issues. Mali Ze in the field of sericulture was dedicated to the research of silkworm breeding and the improvement of silkworms. Shen Muwei and Yan Nake, who recently came to China, are studying central and local political systems, respectively. Looking at the above, although the work of the council is still minor in terms of the overall national economic construction, it is sufficient to prove that the council has the ability to bear the burden of promoting the economy amid layers of difficulties.</p>

<h3 id="e48">Ximeng and Other Leagues and Banners Telegraph to Nanjing Requesting Autonomy, Intending to Resist Aggression and Seek Survival, and Seeking a Way Out for a Small Number of People. The Mongolian Office Hosts the Press to Unofficially Release the Full Text of the Telegraph <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The government initially intended not to publish the Ximeng's telegraph requesting autonomy. Later, Mongolian representatives feared that misunderstandings would arise and rumors would spread, so they unofficially released it at a reception hosted by the Mongolian Office today. (Title omitted) In recent years, our country has been plagued by wars, famines, and disturbances, and the borderlands have been shrinking daily and foreign troubles have been deepening. Our Mongolia is close to Japan, and the pain is particularly acute. With vast lands and a small population, the weak nation has no power to resist and no way to defend. It is like meat on a chopping board, to be slaughtered by others. In the past ten years, Outer Mongolia has been plundered by Soviet Russia, and our Hulunbuir has fallen to Japan. Recently, Zhuozhao and other leagues have also been successively destroyed. The movement in Ximeng has shaken North China, and the situation is critical, causing concern throughout the country. Our Mongolian old and weak people are sitting and suffering slaughter, which is indeed their fate. Although the central government has the responsibility to support and relieve them, it is plagued by internal troubles and the situation is changing. The authorities do not even have time to save themselves. How can our Mongolia bear to ask the central government for assistance? Moreover, after the ravages of war, special envoys are dispatched from time to time to the remote areas to inquire, which proves that we are closely related and share weal and woe. Our Mongolia is deeply grateful for this. It is not impossible to be complacent and seek temporary peace in the face of borderland alerts. However, with the strong neighbors invading more and more urgently, there is no time to delay. Like sparrows living in a tent, the disaster of destruction is imminent. Complacency and seeking temporary peace are no longer allowed by the situation. Although the anxiety is great, there is no way to deal with it. If we do not force ourselves to make a decision, one day a strong enemy will overwhelm the border, and everywhere will be ruins. The accumulated weakness of Mongolia will inevitably be gradually swallowed up by the storm, causing deep concern to the central government. The collapse of the fence will lead to the death of Mongolia and affect our compatriots. The destruction of one part will lead to chaos and concern for the whole. The crime is deep. In times of crisis, the deer do not choose the shade. All our compatriots, putting themselves in the place of the Mongolian people, consider carefully for the Mongolians. Apart from self-determination and autonomy, what other way is there? We remember that Mr. Sun Yat-sen, with great difficulty, established the country, based on the autonomy of the people and taking the support of the weak as his mission. His teachings are followed by all generations. The central military is busy with affairs and has no time to worry about the remote areas. How dare our Mongolia not rise up and follow Mr. Sun's teachings, taking responsibility for self-determination and self-encouragement? The league leaders Zasak et al. have carefully examined the resolution of the 20th National Congress, which had the precedent of specially allowing Outer Mongolia to be autonomous. Therefore, on July 26th of this year, in Bailingmiao, Ujimqin League, a meeting of all officials of Inner Mongolia was convened. Everyone agreed to adopt a high degree of autonomy and establish an Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government to urgently seek unity and promotion to show what the central government could not do. With self-determination and autonomy in everything, it is hoped that the urgent situation can be reversed, the national border can be defended, and the people's will is pure. Everyone is asking for this. Therefore, they resolutely proceeded, and the atmosphere was invigorated. All considerations for responding to public opinion, coping with the environment, and implementing autonomy, in addition to the formal report to the central government for review by the league leaders Zasak Wang Gong and others, are hereby sent in advance to convey the truth of our Mongolia's promotion of autonomy. The true meaning of autonomy is that due to the urgency of the situation, the pressure of the environment, and the exhaustion of the way, we are determined to save ourselves and save the country and have to urgently plan for self-determination to remedy the danger. As for military affairs and diplomacy, which are related to the national system, our Mongolia is weak and powerless. In peacetime, we still rely on the central government for assistance. At the critical juncture of survival, all external measures rely even more on the central government. We also hope that the officials of the authorities will uphold Mr. Sun's principle of treating all people equally and the spirit of the world as one, understand their difficulties, pity their weakness, guide and encourage them to make up for their shortcomings, teach them what they do not know, and encourage their spirit of self-determination and autonomy, promoting their determination to strive for self-improvement, reforming their stubbornness, and renewing their governance. The upper levels will use this to assist the central government's earnest return to governance, and the lower levels will use this to comfort our Mongolia's eager desire, so that the people of the five races can help each other and coexist, forming a single entity. It is hoped that the danger can be reversed, the border can be secured, and the Mongolian people will be fortunate and the country will be fortunate. Sonam Pungbuutan, Right Banner Zasak Prince of Ujumqin, Xilingol League, Deputy League Leader Prince Demchugdongrub and dozens of others co-signed. (Special dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wu Heling, Director of the Mongolian Association Office, hosted a press conference and reported that the central government has dispatched Minister Huang and Deputy Commissioner Zhao to inspect the various leagues and banners of Inner Mongolia in response to Mongolia's request for autonomy. They will surely have a clear observation and appropriate disposal. Originally, the Mongolian autonomy issue was raised during the completion of the Northern Expedition in the 17th year of the Republic of China. When the policy of supporting the self-determination and autonomy of small ethnic groups was promoted to Mongolia, the various leagues and banners had a request to establish an Inner Mongolia local government, wanting to implement autonomy within the scope of not hindering national unity. Now, Mongolian land has lost most of it due to the national government's inability to manage it. And the only remaining Xilingol and Ujimqin leagues and banners have also become fish in a cauldron. They feel that without autonomous organization, it is not enough to resist aggression and seek survival, so they have once again put forward the request for autonomy to the central government. As for their requested high degree of autonomy, it does not mean breaking away from China's independence. Some people have put the crimes of surrendering to Japan and attaching to rebellion with a background, etc. on the heads of the Mongolians. This is a statement that departs from the facts. Mongolia will never cooperate with Japan because the Mongolians are unwilling to change the league and banner system. The Japanese have already abolished the three leagues of Ulaanchab, Chahar, and Jerim, changing them into four provinces in the southeast, northwest, and they have also changed the Danzasak into a banner chief, trying to break up the unity of the league and banner chiefs everywhere. For example, they only changed the seven banners of the Josutu League and the seven banners of the southern part of the Jerim League into their respective autonomy, not allowing them to establish a common agency. Why are they abandoning this and choosing that? Therefore, we very much hope that the government should prevent the Japanese from snatching away the existing Mongolia again and not worry that Mongolia is betraying the central government. People say that this Mongolian request for autonomy is a political way out for a small number of people. As long as more positions are given, it can be resolved. In fact, the Mongolian intention in requesting autonomy is to gather all their strength to resist aggression and seek survival. The telegraph of intent has already made it very clear, and the people who signed the telegraph of intent all have their hereditary positions. Now, if their problem of resisting aggression and seeking survival is not solved, and the method of appeasing and disrupting elements is used to deal with it, it is like climbing a tree to catch fish. I hope that the government will appreciate the difficulties of Mongolia's request for autonomy and try to make it generate the power to resist foreign aggression, which will be beneficial to both the country and the local area. After the telegraph of intent was issued, it was originally scheduled to convene a meeting in Bailingmiao on September 28 to discuss the implementation methods. Later, I heard that the central government decided to send senior officials to promote it, so it has been postponed until now. In the middle, there have only been two meetings. One was on the 9th of this month. As a result, 24 people were elected to draft the organization law of the autonomous government, preparing to contact the senior officials. The other was on the 15th of this month to pass the autonomous plan. The contents are not detailed, but Yun, the league leader of the Ujimqin League, the landlord of Bailingmiao, has repeatedly telegraphed to Nanjing, expressing that he wants to seek autonomy under the support of the party and the country. During the progress of this meeting, the Japanese also convened a Mongolian banner meeting in Dolon Nor. The notices they gave to the various leagues and banners were very serious with coercion and inducement. Their intention was to prevent the Bailingmiao meeting from being held. However, the officials and representatives of the various leagues and banners still gathered in Bailingmiao as agreed, so that no one attended the Dolon Nor meeting. Now, the officials and representatives who have arrived in Bailingmiao are all eager to get a satisfactory result, so Yun, the league leader of the Ujimqin League, and Prince De, the deputy league leader of the Xilingol League (i.e., Prince De), etc., have repeatedly telegraphed to welcome the senior officials to go, and have repeatedly telegraphed to invite Heling to go. It is my duty to depart to the north in a day or two. I have three creeds for Mongolia: one is cooperation between the local and central governments, two is cooperation between the leagues and banners and the provinces and counties, and three is cooperation between the princes and commoners. This time, I will go to Bailingmiao to fulfill the autonomy of Inner Mongolia in accordance with this creed. (Special dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Bailingmiao News: Prince De convened a meeting on the 9th. Due to insufficient numbers, it was changed to a preparatory meeting. 106 princes and dukes arrived and elected 23 people to draft the organization law of the autonomous government. It was passed by the general assembly on the 15th. Except for military affairs and diplomacy, which are still under the central government, the administrative affairs of Inner Mongolia are all handled by the autonomous government. The highest authority is the autonomous government. The committee has two offices under it: the Senate and the Administrative Office, as well as the Legal Committee. The Administrative Office has eight offices under it: General Affairs, Secretary, Education, Police, Industry, Transportation, Public Relations, and Construction. The autonomous government will choose one of the three places: Bailingmiao, Siziwang Banner, and Prince De's mansion, to be established. We hope for assistance from the central government.

<p>(Taiyuan) Wei Dexin, who once served as the commander of the Jin Army regiment, the garrison commander of Jintong, and is now a counselor of the Sui Headquarters, was the city defense commander of Shuoxian during the war in Yanbei. Because of crimes such as privately storing military supplies, he arbitrarily executed Li Zhiren, the president of the Chamber of Commerce. Li is the brother of Li Shangren, the current member of the Jin Provincial Government. Later, after Yan clarified the matter, Wei was sentenced to twelve years in prison. Last year, he asked someone to mediate with Li's side and was released from prison. Li Shu, the son of Zhiren, who is over twenty years old and a graduate of an industrial college, followed Wei to the Shifangyuan Temple outside the North Gate this morning to listen to Buddha lectures. When he returned to the city, he shot Wei with a pistol on North Gate Street at about 12 o'clock and surrendered to the police station, claiming revenge for his father. The court examined the body in the evening and Wei's wife took the body away. The assassin is currently detained in the Public Security Bureau pending legal resolution.

<p>(Xiamen) Jiang Guangnai arrived in Xiamen from the province on the Hai Ning wheel at 6:00 am on the 20th. He landed and visited Lin Guogeng. He left at 7:30 am to visit various scenic spots. At 10:00 am, he crossed to Gulangyu Island to Huang Yi's residence and attended a banquet with Huang and Li Qingquan. At 2:30 pm, he changed to the Jinan wheel and went to Guangdong. Qiu Zhao琛, the head of the provincial public security bureau, accompanied him. Jiang met with reporters at his residence. According to him, he returned to Guangdong to complete his son's marriage and had no mission. The reorganization of Chen Guohui's remnants is a fact. Because the army was transferred to northern and western Fujian to suppress the bandits, the bandits in Quanzhou and Yongchun took the opportunity to cause trouble. The troops were insufficient to suppress them. After consideration, a combination of suppression and appeasement was used to give them a way to start anew. However, he had ordered Weng Zhaoyuan to handle it according to: (1) No retaliation is allowed; (2) The salaries are issued by the provincial government and no local financing is allowed; (3) Obey orders, listen to training, and do not occupy territory. If this is violated, reorganization will not be allowed. (Special dispatch on the 20th)</p>

<h3 id="e83">Fang Ji's Troops Are Being Disbanded, After Inspection, There Are a Total of More Than 6,000 Officers and Soldiers, Transported in Batches to Baoding for Reorganization and Separation. Fang Zhenwu and Sun Heqiao Escape Danger, Ji Hongchang Has Secretly Arrived in Tianjin <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Beiping Communication: After Fang Zhenwu and Ji Hongchang left the army, their troops, led by Mi Wenhe, were mobilized to the areas of Dongxiduling Village, Tian Ge Village, Dongjia Village, and Qianhou Heyu to await inspection. The Military Branch sent Huang Shiyue to inspect the troops on the morning of the 17th in conjunction with Lu Ji, the Chief of Staff of the 32nd Army. By the afternoon of yesterday (18th), it was completely completed. Fang Ji's troops originally had more than 14,000 people. The inspection revealed that only more than 6,000 remained, including 194 officers, 116 soldiers, and 86 students from Fang Zhenwu's headquarters, about 3,000 officers and soldiers from Zhao Chengkai's troops of Fang's department, 390 officers and 82 soldiers from Mi Wenhe's department, about 200 cavalrymen and 100 horses from Wang Ying's department, and 1,029 officers and 951 soldiers from Ji Hongchang's department, totaling 6,558 people. The number of guns, more than 1,600 from Fang's department, about 470 from Ji's department, totaling about 2,000 guns. After the inspection was completed, Huang Shiyue returned to Ping last night (18th) to report. Fang Ji's troops were ordered to concentrate in the Sunhe area and transport them to Baoding in batches for reorganization. The first two batches departed from Sunhe South at 5:00 AM this morning (19th), passed Taipingzhuang at 8:00 AM, and arrived in Qinghe in the afternoon. From Qinghe, they took a car to Fengtai and headed to Baoding. The remaining troops are also being transported in succession. Once all the troops are transported to Baoding, they will begin reorganization and separation. Because Fang Ji's troops have surrendered their arms and been transported away from the war zone, the armies in the front have begun to demobilize separately from today. The Japanese army in the Niulanshan Huairou area is also gradually withdrawing towards Miyun Gubeikou.</p>
<p>Fang Ji's whereabouts are unknown, which has caused suspicion from the outside world. According to reliable sources, when Fang Ji personally met with Shang Zhen, Xu Tingyao, and Guan Linzheng at Fengjiaying on the 16th, they agreed on all the measures. Fang Ji decided to leave the army and go to Tianjin to go abroad. A certain general who was present, using the excuse of changing clothes, notified a certain regiment stationed in Sunhe by telephone in another room, ordering them to send troops to detain Fang Zhenwu when he crossed the defense line, and wait for instructions. Ji could be released. The certain general's move was carried out under orders. When a certain general went out, some people in the seat suspected him. Later, Fang Ji left Fengjiaying in a car at 4:00 PM. Shang Zhen, because he had become sworn brothers with Fang Zhenwu and had a very deep friendship, gave Fang 5,000 yuan in paper money as travel expenses. At that time, Fang was still wearing a Zhongshan suit, and Shang also instructed him to change his clothes to make it more convenient on the way. Seeing Shang's sincerity and gratitude, Fang burst into tears, and hearing the words of changing clothes, he could not help but change his complexion in a miserable way, and immediately changed his clothes, with the feeling of a hero's end. When boarding the car, Shang and Fang Ji reluctantly bid farewell, urging them to take care. Xu Tingyao also stepped forward to shake hands with Fang and said goodbye. Fengjiaying is the defense zone of Shang's department. Eight or nine miles to the south is Sunhe, which is the defense zone of a certain army and is garrisoned by a certain army. Fang took five guards and took another car. Ji took the same car as Liu Diquan, a representative of the Beijing charity organization. Seven or eight miles away from Fengjiaying, when they arrived at Sunhe Bridge, a regiment of a certain army rushed up and blocked the way. The soldiers all held guns in a aiming posture, and the situation was very serious. After the car stopped, the soldiers shouted, "Is Fang Zhenwu in the car? Chairman Huang is setting up a banquet tonight at the Water Company (Sunhe has a water plant, about a mile away from Sunhe Bridge. The tap water in Beiping is supplied from there) to wash away the dust. Fang and Ji heard the words in silence. Then Liu Diquan replied that Fang Ji's car was still behind and would arrive soon. The army believed it to be true, withdrew some troops, and waited separately, but forced it to drive to the door of the water company and wait for inspection. Seeing that the situation was not good, Fang excused himself to get off the bus and escaped on the way. Ji arrived at the door of the water company, and after inspection, was allowed to leave. After Fang Ji left, a certain general rushed from Fengjiaying to Sunhe to inquire about Fang's whereabouts, but it was as if he had disappeared. He immediately sent people to search in all directions, but there was no trace of him. Ji Hongchang and Liu Diquan and others left Sunhe and traveled more than ten miles. The car broke down and abandoned the car to walk, and stayed overnight in a wild village, arrived in Ping before dawn, and rested briefly. That night, they took a bus to Tianjin, first staying in a hotel, and moved to a certain concession yesterday morning. It is heard that he has left Tianjin today and gone elsewhere, and the direction is unknown. Fang Zhenwu escaped from Sunhe and has not been found. According to a certain source, Fang traveled by night and slept by day, passing through Sanhe Wuqing, and arrived in Tianjin last night. Whether this is reliable remains to be proven.

<p>Yoshi Ming Arrives in Ping</p>
<p>Plan to Stay in Ping for a Month, Hoping to Open Sino-Japanese Diplomacy</p>
<p>Beiping Communication, Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations have gradually improved through the efforts of the diplomatic authorities of both sides recently. Huang Fu, the Chairman of the Beiping Political Rectification Committee, has sent Li Zeyi, the reception commissioner of the war zone, south to Japan, and Japanese Minister Yoshi has also arrived in Ping tonight (19th). The exchange of envoys between the two sides is indeed different from the previous situation of being in a hostile situation. It is heard that Yoshi plans to stay in Ping for a month and will have concrete discussions with Huang Fu on issues such as the Post Office of the Puppet State and North China, the international train between Ping and Liaoning, the passage through the various passes of the Great Wall, the establishment of customs, the navigation of the Luan River, and maintaining the peace of the demilitarized zone. However, Yoshi still strongly denies it to the outside world. Yoshi was accompanied by Counselor Arino and others. When Yoshi arrived at the station, staff from the Japanese Embassy and outstanding Japanese expatriates in Ping all went to the station to welcome him. Fang's military, political, and party authorities also sent Cai Yantao and Shang Ming as representatives to greet Yoshi at the station. After Yoshi got off the bus, he exchanged pleasantries with the welcoming staff and was accompanied by staff from the Japanese Embassy to the Japanese Embassy. According to Yoshi, "This visit is only for inspection purposes. The various issues in the war zone are mostly related to the state of Manchukuo and are handled by the Kwantung Army. I am not responsible for diplomatic negotiations. When will I see Huang? It has not been decided yet. The words are extremely smooth and worthy of scrutiny." (October 19)</p>

<p>Kaifeng Communication, The Disaster Relief Group of the Yellow River Water Disaster Relief Committee recently sent Yang Zigong to Bian to set up the Henan Emergency Relief Investigation Office. The office was formally established yesterday (18th). The staff members have all been appointed and are stepping up their work. As soon as the Yellow Disaster Committee allocates 20,000 yuan of relief funds to Henan, it can carry out relief according to the scheduled plan. In addition to setting up a general office in Bianyuan, the office also set up investigation and relief branches in the five counties of Hua, Wen, Fengqiu, Lanfeng, and Kaocheng, which were severely affected by the disaster. The Hua Wen two county branch has been established first, and the other branches can also be established soon.</p>
<p>The Yellow Disaster Committee previously sent Zhou Xiangxian, director of the Engineering and Reconstruction Group, to Bian to discuss the post-disaster plan for river works with Chen Ruzhen, director of the Henan River Affairs Bureau. A concrete method has been discussed. Then Zhou returned to Beijing, and Chen was concurrently appointed by the Yellow Disaster Committee as the director of the first district engineering office of the Engineering and Reconstruction Group. Li Zhongqiang, the chief engineer sent by the committee, also arrived in Bian to preside over the work. After receiving the appointment, he actively prepared for the establishment. Now the engineering office has been established in Lanfeng, and a temporary office has been set up in Kaifeng. Except for the two places of Lan and Kao, which were simultaneously started with workers on the 11th of this month, the two places of Mengjin and Wen County are also being surveyed. The workers recruited in each section all follow the purpose of replacing relief with work and accommodate as many victims as possible. (October 18)</p>

<p>Jinan Communication, According to the report of the medical team of the Yellow River Water Disaster Relief Committee's Sanitation Group, south of the Jin Dyke in Fan County, the floodwaters are flowing horizontally, and the villages are still in the waves. The residents on both sides are using ferries to cross. There are more than 19,000 victims who have no homes to return to, more than 22,700 people who are currently starving, and 21,700 poor people who will be hungry in the future. For several days, the number of victims has also increased by more than 300 households every day. In the past, each person could get four bowls of porridge per meal, but now they only get one or two bowls. The number of patients is 938 on the 9th, 257 on the 10th, 236 on the 11th, 264 on the 12th, 224 on the 13th, and 293 on the 14th. The number of patients in the Jining disaster area is 566, 53 on the 6th, 84 on the 7th, 199 on the 10th, and 178 on the 11th. According to a telegram from the Fan County magistrate, the water between the Jin Dyke and the Great Dyke has increased by 8 centimeters due to the fact that the breach in Shitou Village has not yet been repaired, and strict prevention is already underway.</p>
<p>The Zhao Wang River, Wanfu River, and Zhu Shui River are the three major rivers in western Shandong. The Department of Construction has organized the water flow in western Shandong in recent years, and the Wanfu and Zhu Shui rivers have been dredged. Only the Zhao Wang River has not been completed. This year, the Yellow River breached in Hebei and Henan, and the flood flowed eastward, and western Shandong suffered a severe water disaster. The Wanfu and Zhu Shui rivers have drainage efficiency, and the counties along the rivers suffered less. The counties along the Zhao Wang River suffered severely. Now that the water has receded, and after the pain has subsided, the Zhao Wang River should be actively dredged. The Department of Construction has now completed the planning and estimation. It is estimated that the earthwork requires 881,500 yuan, and the box masonry embankment requires 180,000 yuan, for a total of 1,061,500 yuan. It will be requested from the provincial government, and the funds will be started. Since the water disaster occurred in western Shandong, all sectors have worked hard to donate in order to gather strength and provide relief. For example, civil servants donate their salaries to help relief, and actors contribute their talents to help relief. Recently, the military clothing shops in Ji City are also very concerned about the disaster victims. The managers of Xinghua Xinjun Clothing Shop, Wang Dingzhen, Tongli Gongjun Clothing Shop, Wang Chichen, Yihe Yongjun Clothing Shop, Xu Zhongsan, Yonghu Maojun Clothing Shop, Jiang Shaoqing, Huasheng Jun Clothing Shop, Sui Yinpu, Dingsheng Jun Clothing Shop, Li Yinkai, and Dingyu Jun Clothing Shop, Zhang Yisan, and other seven military clothing shops jointly donated 200 sets of cotton clothes to help the disaster victims in western Shandong. The cotton clothes have been transported to the provincial relief committee and will be transported to the disaster area for distribution soon. (October 19)</p>
<h3 id="e86">Zhang Qun Cables Chiang Kai-shek with Suggestions for Reforming the Political System; Chiang Disapproves Changes to the Current System of Commissioners, but Approves Subsidies for Impoverished Counties in Hubei <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Provincial Chairman Zhang Qun, having previously received from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek a mandate to revitalize county administration, was ordered to draft concrete implementation measures and telegraph them for approval. The telegraph included three proposed measures: (1) Joint offices for various departments; (2) Reforming the administrative commissioner system; (3) Temporary subsidies for county administration expenses. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek replied, stating that, except for the first item, which had been telegraphed to the chairmen of the seven provinces of Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Anhui, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Jiangsu to solicit their opinions, the second item was deemed unnecessary for discussion and the third item could be implemented as proposed. The exchange of telegrams between Chiang and Zhang was released by the provincial government on the 18th, and is disclosed as follows:</p>
<p>Zhang Qun's telegram to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek reads: "One, Respectfully to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in Nanchang, respectfully acknowledging receipt of your instructions. That local officials should be close to the people has been emphasized in all dynasties, with great importance placed on their selection. In recent years, official corruption has worsened daily, and the position of county magistrate has become increasingly trivial. Laws and regulations are increasingly stringent, but governance is increasingly derelict, causing hardship for both officials and the people, a situation that could not be worse. Your Excellency deeply considers governance to be rooted in channeling human and material resources to the counties. We, your subordinates, follow the current and propagate your intentions, daring not to deviate from your virtuous aims in implementing them. However, the province's budget, as determined by Your Excellency, has already seen rigorous cuts to all superfluous organizations and redundant personnel last year. Now, after further review by the various departments, there are truly no organizations that can be cut, nor any redundant personnel that can be eliminated. The expenses for the personnel of this government are reported monthly, and we trust they have been carefully scrutinized. Moreover, the total annual expenses for the seventy counties in this province are a little over eight hundred eighty thousand yuan. Increasing this by one-third would require over five hundred eighty thousand yuan annually, and even increasing it by half would require over four hundred forty thousand yuan. This cannot be compensated by merely cutting a few redundant personnel. We believe that organizational expenses are determined by the current organizational structure. If, within the current structure, the tedium of layered submissions and transfers could be eliminated, the effect of reducing personnel and streamlining administration would be naturally achieved. County administration is an integral part of provincial administration; if provincial administration is not thoroughly rectified, it will be difficult to achieve the goal of revitalizing county administration. Your Excellency already listed the shortcomings of the current committee system of the provincial government during the first internal affairs conference, and proposals for a provincial governor system were also made at the Third Plenary Session. However, the matter is of great importance and cannot be completed overnight. For the sake of facilitating implementation, the various departments of the provincial government could, under the current system, first consolidate their offices and conduct official business jointly. All official documents would be issued in the name of the provincial government, and the heads of each department would countersign matters under their jurisdiction. This would eliminate the need for each department head to forward documents upward to the relevant ministries and the provincial government, and downward to the various counties, as well as the layered transfer of documents between departments. Following this model, personnel expenses could naturally be reduced by half. Among the provincial government's subordinate units, apart from the expenses of the Security Bureau, which are based on the military organization system and should be discussed separately, the total expenses of the provincial government and the Western Hubei Administrative Office amount to over one million one hundred nineteen thousand yuan. If half of this amount could be saved, it would be roughly equivalent to one-fifth of the necessary county administration expenses, and the difference would not be far off. If this system is implemented, the provincial government will have unified will from above, and the counties will be free from the suffering of conflicting and complicated government orders from below. Barriers will be removed, and communication will be easier. Moreover, it will not only save expenses. This concerns the organization of the provincial government. Under the current system, the administrative inspector-general concurrently serves as the magistrate of the county in which they are stationed. The initial intention of this law was to rectify the long-standing problems in county administration by leveraging the power of the inspector-general. However, the position of the inspector-general is equal to that of the department heads, making supervision and accountability difficult when evaluating performance. Moreover, everyone has their limitations. Those skilled in political affairs may not necessarily be knowledgeable in military matters, and those diligent in serving the people may be negligent in observing officials. The inspector-general, in their own person, concurrently serves as the security commander and the county magistrate. Not only is it difficult to combine these talents, but their energy is also likely to be insufficient. Although there are deputy commanders and secretaries assisting them, if they do not personally oversee matters, problems are bound to arise. If the expenses of each county are increased, and the financial resources are sufficient, governance will naturally be easier. It seems unnecessary for the inspector-general to concurrently hold these positions. Instead, capable and virtuous individuals should be carefully selected to focus on their responsibilities, so that all can advance equally without undue emphasis on one aspect. As for the system of inspector-generals, it seems that it can also be changed to some extent, with the position of security commander as their primary role, while also overseeing inspections. The division of each district should also be based primarily on bandit suppression and military affairs, consolidating them into four or five districts, so that the population is roughly equal, without being too small or too large, in order to trial the division of military districts and establish a foundation for conscription. This concerns the organization of administrative inspector-generals. The above suggestions involve changing the current system. We humbly await your selection and implementation of any merits. However, county administration expenses urgently need to be increased and should not be delayed. Since this year's budget has already been determined, it is proposed that, excluding the counties concurrently administered by the inspector-generals, a total of fifty-nine counties be subsidized at a rate of three hundred yuan per month, regardless of the county's classification, starting from the second half of this year. This will require an additional expense of one hundred six thousand two hundred yuan for six months, which will be initially allocated from the provincial treasury and then offset later. This is a temporary subsidy measure for this year. This is the extent of our financial capabilities in this province. If the financial situation improves slightly next year, or if the current system is changed, new regulations will be formulated. As for the allocation of county administration expenses, the treatment of county magistrates and their staff, and the terms of office and performance evaluations, all relevant matters will be thoroughly discussed by the department and submitted for approval. We dare to exert our foolishness to answer your insightful questions. We respectfully request your instructions. Zhang Qun bows."</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's reply to Zhang Qun briefly stated: (The proposed methods for reforming the current system of provincial government and commissioners are not without merit. The following is a separate review: (1) Already seen in the previous report, omitted for brevity.) (2) The concurrent position of commissioner and local county magistrate is the sole basis for the establishment of the commissioner system. If only undertaking inspection and not simultaneously in charge of governance, this would resemble a redundant position and would not match reality, similar to an ineffective administrator. The successful promotion of all policies must be driven by the commissioner taking up the role of county magistrate, setting an example for others. Only those who can set such an example can truly grasp the difficulties therein, and thus supervise others with clarity and effectiveness. Over the past year, ministerial orders where some progress has been made have generally been in counties managed by the commissioner, thus clearly proving the benefit. To claim that the commissioner has too many duties, bringing together literary and military affairs, observing officials, managing the public, is insufficient in terms of skill and energy, ignoring that such powers and responsibilities are generally required of a local official. The county magistrate historically has also been a leader of the defense corps or security force, with the county also under his jurisdiction for the assessment of subordinate officials. Why should this be different for the commissioner? Moreover, the organization of the commissioner's office provides for a secretary, deputy security commander, staff, and adjutants to assist him. When on patrol, the secretary or deputy commander may be sent as a substitute. This measure was provided at the beginning of the establishment. If one has concerns that the commissioner, with the full organization, has insufficient energy, what is to be said of the county magistrate who has few staff to aid them? Within a province, finding a few or even a dozen such commissioners is considered a challenge; what, then, can be said of the task of employing hundreds of county magistrates? Therefore, since it is difficult to find widely available county magistrates, if counties under the care of a commissioner are to be removed and the entire province brought into parallel progress, it would, in name, be to prevent disparity. In reality, no county would have an effective county magistrate. As the county magistrate's station would be unable to be raised, the commissioner's compensation would then have to be brought into line, somewhat reduced, although equivalent to the station of department head. Even the punishment and rewards will then be decided by the provincial council, not dissimilar to the promotion and demotion of county magistrates. In the evaluation of performance, there will be no issue of difficult oversight. What has been described here indicates that the purpose of the commissioner's establishment has not been clearly understood. Last August, the headquarters distributed instructions on the purpose of the commissioner, which may be referenced. The suggestion that commissioners should not be in charge of county magistrate is therefore to be ruled out. (3) A temporary subsidy of 300 yuan for all counties shall be provided. Once the reform of the provincial system is confirmed, remaining expenditures may be transferred to the counties. This may be put into effect. (18th day)</p>
<h3 id="e87">Qingdao's Import Trade Declines <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>The Prosperity Promotion Association Suggests that the Municipal Government Request the Organization of a Customs Duty Reduction Committee</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: The Qingdao Prosperity Promotion Association, since its establishment, has been actively pursuing plans to promote the city's prosperity. Projects such as the purchase of model automobiles and the construction of medium-sized residences are closely related to the people's livelihood. Recently, in order to protect maritime transport from being affected by land transport, it specifically petitioned the municipal government, detailing that the development of import and export goods is closely related to the prosperity of Qingdao. It requested that the municipal government send letters to relevant parties such as the Qingdao Customs, the Jiaoji Railway Bureau, and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, requesting the prompt organization of a Customs Duty Reduction Committee to jointly discuss solutions. The original text is as follows: "We believe that there are many ways to promote the prosperity of Qingdao. Attracting tourists is certainly one method, but the fundamental lifeline lies in the development of import and export goods. The rise and fall of Qingdao is directly proportional to the development of import and export goods. Since the development of import and export goods is closely related to the prosperity of Qingdao, we observe that the current trend is that import and export goods are in danger of declining. The reason for this is the issue of customs duties. The volume of import and export goods handled by any seaport is always determined by the cost required for the goods themselves. If the cost is low, merchants will flock to it and the volume will be high. If the cost is high, merchants will bypass it and the volume will be low. The relationship between profit and loss is clearly and unmistakably shown. Most of Shandong's major export goods are transported to Shanghai and then transshipped abroad. However, the goods from Shandong to Shanghai, in addition to being transported by the Jiaoji Railway to this city and then shipped to Shanghai by sea, are also transported by land via the Tianjin-Pukou Railway and the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway. Let us compare the transportation costs of Shandong's major export goods between Jinan and Shanghai by sea and land (attached table omitted). From the table, it can be seen that the transportation costs of major goods such as crude oil, raw rice, cotton, tobacco leaves, silk cocoons, and jujubes from Jinan to Shanghai via the Tianjin-Pukou Railway are lower than the transportation costs from Jinan to Shanghai via Qingdao by sea. Merchants will always choose the route with lower costs. In the future, the trend of Shandong's major goods being transported to Shanghai will be to abandon the sea route and take the land route. If this continues, Qingdao will not only have no hope of prosperity, but will also decline day by day. The key reason why the cost of transporting Shandong's major export goods to Shanghai is lower by land than by sea is that there are no customs duties on land transport, but there are customs duties on sea transport. Although there is the Jinling Customs on land, the railway is considered inland and no customs duties are levied. We have little research on the customs duty system, but since both routes are within the country and the goods have the same destination, why is there a difference? For the sake of promoting the prosperity of Qingdao, we must promptly devise a rescue plan. The customs duty system has been in place for a long time. The Qingdao Customs has taxes, while the Jinling Customs does not. This is not a recent phenomenon. Even if we check the cargo transportation statistics of the Jiaoji Railway over the years, although there are increases and decreases, it had recovered to the original state of the twelfth year in the twentieth year (attached table omitted). Based on this example, it seems that customs duties are not affected in any way. How can we know that the situation in the country is different after the twentieth year, and that the cost of transportation is also greatly different from the twentieth year? Let us describe this as follows: Before January of the twentieth year, there were numerous internal taxes and levies in the country, and the burden of taxes on land transport between Jinan and Shanghai via Shandong, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces can be imagined. If transported by sea, there is only Shandong province, and the taxes are simple. Even with the addition of customs duties, it is still not as heavy as the land route. This is why the volume of goods entering and leaving Qingdao port can still be maintained year by year. Since January 1, in the twentieth year, with the implementation of the 'abolition of internal taxes,' all internal taxes were swept away, and the actual cost of goods borne by land was lower than that by sea. How can the volume of import and export goods in Qingdao port not be affected by this? This is the first reason. Before the railway cargo transportation was responsible, there were many miscellaneous fees for land transportation between Jinan and Shanghai, such as escort fees, which cost several tens of yuan per car. The cost of crossing the river at Pukou was as high as one yuan and thirty yuan per ton. After the implementation of cargo liability on the Tianjin-Pukou and Shanghai-Nanjing Railways in September of last year, the escort fees were cancelled, and the cost of crossing the river at Pukou was also regulated separately due to the joint operation of Tianjin-Pukou and Shanghai-Nanjing. The current calculation is only about three yuan. In the future, when the ferry is implemented (October 10), the cost is only regulated at two yuan and five jiao. The cost of land transportation between Jinan and Shanghai has been greatly reduced due to the implementation of cargo liability and the opening of the Pukou ferry, while the cost of sea transportation remains the same. Generally, merchants will inevitably abandon this and take that. This is the second reason. In addition, it is found that the national cargo intermodal transportation has been implemented from November 1 of this year. According to the intermodal price, a reduction of one percent is given for every hundred kilometers over five hundred kilometers. The land route from Jinan to Shanghai is 1,020 kilometers, so a reduction of six percent should be given. If the goods are transferred from Qingzhou to Jinan to Shanghai, a reduction of seven percent is given. If transferred from Weixian to Jinan to Shanghai, a reduction of eight percent is given. With the reduction in the price of intermodal transportation, all goods west of Weixian will be absorbed by the land route. This is the third reason. In view of the three situations mentioned above, Qingdao port will not only be unable to absorb the goods on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway in Shandong in the future, but the goods exported from this port, that is, the goods along the Jiaoji Railway, which have always been exported through Qingdao as the only port, may also be absorbed. Isn't this the greatest fatal blow to Qingdao port? If we want to rescue it, we must find a way to make the Qingdao Customs the same as the Jinling Customs. All goods exported from this port to Shanghai will not be taxed temporarily, and will be taxed again when they are exported from Shanghai. This is the best policy. Even if this cannot be achieved, if taxes are paid at the Qingdao Customs to Shanghai, all those who do not transport exports should be regarded as inland and the customs duties should be refunded by the customs. In practice, it can still be the same as the Jinling Customs. If this is the case, land and sea transportation will be equal, and the volume of import and export goods in this port can be maintained at the previous level, and this city can achieve the goal of prosperity. We hereby submit this document to the municipal government, requesting that it send letters to the Qingdao Customs, the Jiaoji Railway Bureau, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the Chamber of Commerce, and the Native Products Association, respectively designating responsible personnel, together with representatives of the municipal government, to form a committee to jointly study and remedy the situation. This is for the public benefit. (October 19)"</p>

<p>The Director of the Jiangsu Construction Department issued a statement yesterday, recorded as follows: "(The construction of this province is complex, and the situation in northern Jiangsu is more important than in southern Jiangsu. The following are the matters that urgently need to be handled: (1) Dredging the Liu Tang River; (2) Assisting in guiding the Huai River; (3) Reclaiming the Huainan area; (4) Improving cotton cultivation; (5) Building major highways. The Liu Tang River and the Huai River are both major water conservancy projects in northern Jiangsu. In addition to the Huai River, which already has a competent authority, this department will assist in the dredging of the Liu Tang River. This department has already dispatched technician Chen Zhiding to the area yesterday to meet with the director of the Huaipi section of the public works office to conduct a survey and come up with concrete measures for soliciting labor and dredging. The Huainan area is vast, and once reclaimed, it will all become fertile land. Cotton cultivation is a specialty of northern Jiangsu, and if improved, production can be greatly increased. Highways are needed for transportation and are also very important. The matters that urgently need to be handled in southern Jiangsu are: (1) Seawall project; (2) Building sluices along the Yangtze River in the Taihu Lake basin; (3) Improving sericulture. The seawall project is very large, and the annual maintenance funds have not yet been allocated. If we want to build and repair it, it will cost several million. This matter should be discussed further, or we should ask the provincial government to designate special funds to be handled in stages. The Taihu Lake is related to the rise and fall of water conservancy in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. The most important plan is to build sluices along the Yangtze River. Sericulture is also a major part of the production in southern Jiangsu, but in recent years, it has become increasingly decadent due to its simplicity and crudeness. Unless it is thoroughly improved, it will not be enough to increase production. As for my principles of doing things, (1) be open and honest; (2) be responsible; (3) focus on production. (October 20)"</p>

<p>Li Zuhua, director of the county's public funds and public property management office, said that the provincial finance department's dispatch of personnel to collect old taxes and offer rewards for success, while simultaneously applying the same reward system to the surtaxed local special levies on land, would affect the implementation of local affairs. He sent telegrams to the Executive Yuan, Ministry of Finance, Provincial Government, Provincial Finance Department, Fourth District Administrative Inspector, and other institutions, stating that the regular and surtaxes have long been divided, and the surtax is originally for local affairs. Such collection fees and late payment penalties have never been applied to the surtax. Such tax collection rewards should also be excluded in order to protect local finances and maintain the implementation of local affairs. He telegraphed a request to exempt the surtax on land from any reward system. The county executive committee also approved the Baoshan County Party's telegram to convene party departments of various counties to send representatives to the province to jointly petition the government. The county has appointed executive committee member Tan Bao as the responsible party.</p>

<p>Zhou Jun, Lu Shixin, and Qian Jinghao, trainers of the 8th District Defense Corps, due to insufficient funding, organized a theatrical performance to raise funds, scheduled to run from the 12th to the 18th at Tianma Mountain. District Chief Zhang Tianmin, believing that theatrical performances were prohibited by the county magistrate, advised them to stop. The trainers continued to prepare, and the tickets were still issued in the name of the district corps headquarters. District Chief Zhang reported the situation, and County Magistrate Jin sent several police officers to the village to ban the performance. It was stopped after the first day. The district chief and trainers were summoned for interrogation. Zhou Jun refused to appear. Trainers Lu and Qian both blamed their actions on Zhou Jun's insistence. They were ordered to post bail and await further summons and interrogation.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Baoshan: Various Townships Telegraph Requests to Rectify Tax Deed Procedures <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>The various townships of this county telegraphed the Department of Finance requesting the rectification of deed tax procedures, stating, "Zhao Xunjian, Director of the Finance Department of Jiangsu Province: We, the people of Baoshan County, find that the county has long been promoting official deeds, using the various township offices as issuing points, which the people already find inconvenient. Since the establishment of the district system, it has become even more inconvenient for the people to buy and sell land, as the process is centralized in the district offices. For example, our district has a long and narrow terrain, with the various townships such as ChuanSha, YinBing, and DuChun in the northernmost part being as far as twenty li away. For the sale and purchase of even small plots of land, at least five or six people, including the seller, the buyer, and the witnesses, must travel back and forth more than forty li, and the road is rugged and difficult to travel. As a result, there are many people who write unofficial deeds with names such as 'preliminary official deed,' 'substitute,' or 'endorsement'. Even if people buy official deeds, it is difficult to investigate due to the long distance, and it is common for them to underreport the value of the deed. This is a major reason for the shortage of tax revenue. The Provincial Government Committee passed a resolution to allow the various townships to assist in the rectification of deed taxes and tasked them with handling this task. This would not only save the people the trouble of traveling back and forth, but it would also allow the various township leaders to conduct investigations nearby, which would be easier to clarify and prevent the above-mentioned abuses from occurring. The future of tax revenue will definitely make rapid progress, which is beneficial to both the national economy and the people's livelihood. This has already been ordered by your department in document number 2001, to be followed by the various counties. Now, the various counties have implemented this order, but Baoshan is alone in regretting that we have not done so. We cannot help but feel aggrieved. We have read the telegram from the county magistrate of Yixing County in your department's instructions, which states that the township offices directly promoting official deeds and assisting in deed taxes will facilitate procedures and increase administrative efficiency. We admire the intention of rectifying taxes. The township leaders believe that we should be treated equally and should not be divided. We have jointly submitted a request to the county magistrate of Baoshan County to implement this measure. We have received instructions from the county magistrate in documents number 245 and 9, stating that the matter of whether to change the county's method of promoting official deeds has been submitted to the Department of Finance for review. We respectfully inform you of this order. However, the people are eagerly awaiting this measure, and we dare to respectfully telegraph this request, hoping that you will investigate the case and order the county to implement it as soon as possible to appease the people's expectations and uphold the law. We are anxiously awaiting your order. Twenty township leaders, including Zhang Jianheng, the leader of Yuepu Township in the fifth district of Baoshan County, respectfully bow."</p>

<p>The connecting express boat in Donglai Town of this county (which is towed by a steamer after reaching Beisha to Changshu) departed on the morning of the 19th. Suddenly, a passenger from another province, upon disembarking, immediately invited other passengers to play cards. Due to the lack of gambling tools on board, it was decided to abandon the idea. Unexpectedly, while collecting tickets on the boat as it passed Chenhang Bridge, the passenger produced a white Browning pistol and fired three shots into the air, then searched the passengers one by one, robbing them of all their silver dollars. Yu Youfu, an accounts collector from Tongrentai Pharmacy, was robbed of over a hundred yuan, the largest sum. He then disembarked at Caijia Bridge, intending to hire a cart to Xitang City. Unexpectedly, the cart driver he hailed had seen him robbing on the road in Chenhang the day before. The cart driver refused to hire his cart and let him walk alone. He then followed him secretly. Upon reaching Xitang City, he reported to the defense corps, who arrested the passenger and found a large amount of cash and a pistol hidden in his coat, as well as a patrol officer's badge from the 13th Water Police Team, but the badge only had the surname "Wang" and no first name. When questioned, the 13th team denied having such an officer. He was sent to the county government for interrogation on the 20th.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Business Tax Dispute Resolved <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>The local business tax bureau, due to the need to increase business tax rates and investigate the accounts of various shops, has encountered public opposition. As of the autumn tax payment deadline, not a single payment has been received. Director Huang once resigned. However, with the mediation of Pang Jiegong, chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, the expansion of the tax assessment has been cancelled, and it has been stated that similar disputes in other counties have been resolved. As the winter tax payment deadline is approaching, the bureau is also willing to make concessions, but the tax rates for the rice, silk, dried goods, groceries, and bean cake industries will be increased, while the rates for other industries will remain the same. It is reported that both parties have reached an agreement, and a formal resolution is expected soon.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Wuxi: Secret Den Manufacturing Poison Pills Smashed <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>The County Public Safety Bureau's Inspectorate, at approximately 4 PM of the day before yesterday, received a tip that the Yuebin Teahouse on Hanchang Road outside Guangfu Gate had a secret room manufacturing poison pills, specializing in fast-acting products for short-term highs, with brand names like "Champagne Three Masters" and "Golden Mouse," sold to various towns and villages in the city and countryside, generating huge profits. They requested a swift arrest. After receiving the tip, Inspector General Jin immediately dispatched inspectors Lu Chenggong and Sun Hao, leading an informant and police officers to the location. Upon arriving, they found a small room behind the teahouse with a false wall. A large glass cabinet was placed against the wall, and after opening the cabinet, a small door, large enough for one person to enter, was revealed. The door led to the second floor of the Huichuntang venereal disease doctor's office, which was the secret den for manufacturing poison pills. Fearing that the inspectors, under the guidance of the informant, would directly reach the secret room, they waited. At that time, twenty people were manufacturing the pills. They then carried out the arrest, seizing a machine for manufacturing poison pills, as well as drying racks, medicinal powder, and other raw materials, along with workers Jiang Longhai and Zhao Quanru, who were taken to the bureau for interrogation and detention. At the same time, a mahjong set and gamblers Wang Shuichang and others were seized in the teahouse and taken in for questioning. It is now reported that Inspector General Jin has identified the main culprits in the pill manufacturing as Cai and Lei, and many others, and is making every effort to investigate and bring them to justice.</p>

<p>In Toutiao Place of Lidian Township in the third district, an elderly widow, Wu, nearly seventy years old and with a violent temperament, had a son named Zhisong who worked as a farmer and lived in poverty. The woman had a nephew, Wu, who was relatively well-off and had taken care of her in her early years. The widow asked to borrow a room from his house to live in temporarily. Unexpectedly, the nephew did not agree. The old woman, in a fit of anger, became suicidal and used an iron tool to slit her own throat and die. The local township immediately reported it to the court, which sent people to inspect the body. After mediation, the son of the deceased, Zhisong, requested to waive the inspection.</p>

<p>Yu Nianci, the son of Yu Yunyan, the former principal of the First National School in this county, worked in a money shop. Recently, he joined a unit of the Northeast Volunteer Anti-Japanese Army as a secretary. Nianci had a beloved, named Quan Shangqing, the daughter of Xu Zuoquan Asheng of the county government. Since falling in love, he had spent thousands of yuan of family money. Four or five days ago, Nianci wanted to go to the Northeast again. When he arrived in Shanghai, he received a letter from a friend saying that his lover was having an affair with someone else. He returned home that night and found Shiqing playing with someone else, which led to a big conflict. Since Nianci had an affair with Shiqing, his family considered it a great disgrace and had long expelled him, forbidding him from entering the house. Now, facing further humiliation, he felt he had no way forward or backward and swallowed opium to commit suicide. When the poison took effect, he was turned away from several places. In the end, a friend helped him to Quan Asheng's house, where he died. This serves as a profound lesson for those who fall into depravity in their youth.</p>

Suppression is particularly difficult. It is now learned that County Magistrate Huang of this county and the captain of the Qingpu Jinshui Marine Police Team have negotiated a joint defense plan. The county and Qingpu water police will deploy elite troops, increase firearms, and form special joint teams to be stationed there permanently, patrolling daily. In addition, the Yaozhuang Bridge and Yuhui base teams will be temporarily placed under their command.

<p>The Shanghai Provisional Municipal Council, having reached the end of its term, submitted its resignation to the Municipal Government.

The original letter from the Municipal Government is transcribed below: Shanghai Municipal Government Letter No. 1523 states that the council has submitted letter No. 95, requesting that it be forwarded for reappointment upon the expiration of its term. Having approved this, it is noted that since the January 28th Incident, the city has been financially strained, and preparations for self-government have not yet been completed. A municipal council cannot be established for the time being. Since its establishment, the council has assisted with all municipal facilities, and its contributions have been outstanding, for which we express our deepest admiration. We urge you to continue to serve despite the difficulties, so that you may lead the way with order. This letter is sent in response for your information. To the Shanghai Provisional Municipal Council, Mayor Wu Tiecheng.</p>

Article 4: The Shanghai-Beiping Through Train should use blue steel cars as much as possible. Article 5: Seven trains should be prepared for the Shanghai-Beiping Through Train. The allocation method is as follows: based on the mileage ratio of each route, Jinpu will provide five trains, Jinghu will provide slightly more than one train, and Beining will provide less than one train. However, for mutual assistance and to maintain orderly management and convenience, Jinghu and Beining Railways should each provide one train. All extra trains provided by Beining will not be charged rental fees to Jinghu. Article 6: The trains provided by each route should not be interchanged as a general principle. Article 7: These seven trains will operate with five trains, with one train undergoing minor repairs at the workshops of the providing route in rotation, and another train undergoing major repairs in rotation. The order and dates of all major and minor repairs should be carried out in accordance with the attached schedule. If the two Beining and Jinghu trains are scheduled for major and minor repairs within the same period, the scheduled minor repair time for the Beining or Jinghu train should be advanced by one minor repair cycle. If the same train is scheduled for major and minor repairs within the same period, the scheduled minor repair for that train should be canceled, and the remaining trains should be advanced by one minor repair cycle accordingly.

Article 8: The operation of the dining car on each train will be managed by the providing route. Article 9: Each train carriage should be equipped with necessary items, such as bedding, and consumable items, such as soap, towels, sanitary water, and brooms, which should be provided by the providing route. The expenses for these consumable items and the laundry costs for bedding will be listed monthly by Jinghu and Beining and submitted to the Through Transportation Department of the Ministry of Railways via Jinpu, and will be paid from the sleeper car revenue. Article 10: The costs of operating materials, such as staff salaries, coal, water, oil, and cotton waste, will be borne by each route, except for oil, water, and cotton waste, which should be provided by the route through which the train is passing as much as possible.

Article 12: If a train provided by Route A is damaged while operating on Route B, Route B should temporarily provide a replacement car and notify Route A by telegram. When the next train returns to Route A, Route A should prepare a replacement car and exchange it for the car provided by Route B, which will then be attached to the original train to return to Route B. However, if Jinpu is in the middle of the route and a train provided by Jinpu is damaged on Jinghu or Beining, in addition to the respective passing route temporarily providing a replacement car, Jinpu should also be notified immediately so that Jinpu can prepare another car to be attached when the train passes through that route, and the replacement car attached by Jinghu or Beining can be exchanged upon arrival at Shanghai or Beiping, to avoid passengers having to change trains mid-journey. Article 13: If a train provided by Route A is damaged on Route B, Route B should provide free minor repairs, but the cost of materials should be borne by the providing route. For major repairs, the train should be sent back to the original providing route for self-repair. If it cannot be transported back to the providing route, the providing route should send materials to Route B for repair, and the transportation of materials and the round-trip travel of workers on Route B should be free of charge. Article 14: The train should not be handed over to Route B with a damaged car at the connecting station. If a damaged car is found, Route A should repair it or replace it with a good car before handing it over, unless the damaged car was originally handed over by Route B. Article 15: The Shanghai-Beiping Through Train should primarily sell through tickets. The sale of short-distance tickets within sections should be the responsibility of the traffic departments of each passing route, and should not exceed the number of seats in each class of carriage. Article 16: The allocation of berths on this train is as follows: the originating route receives 60%, and the transit route receives 40%, which should be managed centrally by each route and not distributed to each ticket office.

All revenue from berth tickets, after deducting the train operating expenses and bedding laundry costs specified in Article 9, should be distributed according to the mileage of each route (the mileage distribution method is based on the instructions of the Through Transportation Department's telegraph). (2) The supplementary berth tickets and capital ferry fees collected by the ticket inspectors on Train 301 and Train 302 (supplementary tickets for passengers traveling beyond class, beyond station, or without a ticket should still use the supplementary ticket formats of each route) should use the supplementary ticket format and reporting methods as follows: (A) Use light yellow, segmented tickets for supplementary payments. (B) The ticket inspector must prepare a report and submit it to the station master to be sent to the accounting department for storage and transfer. Article 18: The service staff on each train, such as baggage clerks, car attendants, electricians, car inspectors, dining car cooks, and attendants, should be assigned by the providing route and travel directly with the train, but the providing route should notify the other two routes of the names and numbers of the aforementioned staff for their record. The train conductor (or passenger traffic inspector), car conductor, ticket inspector, coupler, police officer, and security team should change shifts at the connecting station. However, between Pukou and Nanjing, the on-duty car conductor of the receiving route should cross the river to hand over to the off-duty car conductor. Article 19: In addition to being managed by their respective providing routes, the service staff on each train should also be under the command of the supervisors of each passing route. If any dereliction of duty or inappropriate handling of matters occurs on the passing route, the relevant department of the passing route may review the situation and notify the providing route for disciplinary action. Article 20: The water used by the carriages on each train should be supplied free of charge by each passing route as much as possible to avoid shortages. Article 21: The heating needed by each train in winter, in addition to being supplied by the locomotive, should be fully supplied by the two terminal stations when the train is parked at the terminals. At the major stations in the middle, when the locomotive is detached from the train, the major stations should also have preparations for supplying heating. Article 22: Commonly damaged parts on each train, such as (1) various springs, (2) various spring iron pieces and screws, (3) steel tiles, brake shoes, and cotter pins, should be pre-stored in a wooden box in each guard car by the providing route for temporary use.

Article 24: Matters not specified in these operational rules should be handled in accordance with the through transportation regulations.

<h3 id="e123">Grain Industry Discusses Sending Personnel to Thoroughly Investigate the Shipment of Japanese and American Rice to Shanghai; Municipal Chamber of Commerce Also Sends Letters of Admonishment, Urging Compliance with Agreements and Fulfillment of Civic Duty <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Eight rice shops in the Nanshi area of this port, including Shenfeng, have purchased 20,050 bags of small-grain rice. Rumors circulate in the market that this rice is of Japanese origin, and the Ningbo Native Place Association in Shanghai has sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce requesting strict measures to prevent the sale of this rice in order to protect domestic agriculture. It is reported that the Grain Industry Association, in order to clarify the true situation, also convened a meeting of its members the day before yesterday, resolving to appoint Fang Yusheng and Chen Shide to conduct a thorough investigation. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce has also sent letters to both the soybean and rice industries to investigate and admonish their members to fulfill their patriotic duties as merchants. The details of the investigation are recorded below.</p>
<p>Letter to the Soybean and Rice Industries: The Ningbo Native Place Association in Shanghai has sent a letter to this Chamber reporting the dumping of aged rice from Japanese warehouses in Shanghai. According to reports, this Japanese rice has now arrived in Shanghai and is stored in Yongxing Warehouse, to be sold by eight rice shops in Nanshi, including Shenfeng. This matter is related to obstructing domestic agricultural production and violating boycott agreements. Your association has the responsibility to supervise and investigate, and cannot ignore it. Please conduct a strict and confidential investigation and, if it is confirmed, impose sanctions according to regulations. This is our sincere request.</p>
<p>Letter to the Rice Shops: This Chamber has previously received a letter from the Ningbo Native Place Association in Shanghai stating that Japan intends to sell over one million stones of stored rice, with the first batch of 25,000 bags already shipped. According to reports, this first batch of Japanese rice has already arrived in Shanghai warehouses and is said to be sold by eight rice shops in Nanshi, including Shenfeng. In addition to sending a letter to the Rice Shop Association for strict investigation and handling, this matter is related to obstructing domestic agricultural production and violating warehouse goods agreements. Your association must admonish its members to refuse to trade and maintain a strict defense, so as not to be taken advantage of by the enemy, and to fulfill their patriotic duties as merchants. Please provide a written report of your compliance.</p>
<p>Grain Industry Meeting: The Grain, Oil, and Cake Association convened a meeting of its members on the afternoon of the day before yesterday, with three to four hundred people in attendance. Only three of the eight shops, including Shenfeng, Changmao, Dafeng, and Dingtai, were present. The attending members requested that the association summon the five absent shops, but they still did not arrive after being summoned. The Guangdong faction sternly questioned and interrogated the chairman as to whether the association knew that these eight shops were selling Japanese rice, and stated that these eight shops were reputable and should not violate the resolutions. Subsequently, the members all said that selling Japanese rice was only for personal gain, and the outside world was discussing it, causing the members to suffer. If strict measures were not taken, the members would refuse to associate with these eight shops. After discussion by the committee members, it was decided that the case should first clarify whether the rice was shipped by a Japanese ship or a Western ship. Fang Yusheng and Chen Shide were appointed as investigators and should immediately investigate. If it is confirmed that the rice was shipped by a Japanese ship, the profits from the sale of the rice will be used for charitable purposes. All the rice purchased by the eight shops, including Shenfeng, will be temporarily kept by this association. Only after obtaining the consent of the members will Fang and Chen be allowed to take on the investigation. The members then dispersed.</p>
<p>Grain Industry Announcement: This is an announcement regarding the receipt of a letter from the Ningxian Rice Shop and Warehouse Association stating that a large quantity of Japanese rice has arrived in Shanghai and that rumors circulate in the market that a large amount has been purchased. We have also received letters from Shen Shouzhang and the Yuantang Grain Shop Association of the Quanzhang Guild Hall stating the same. Based on this, an emergency meeting of the executive committee was convened on October 19, resolving to investigate. The eight shops purchased 25,000 bags of small-grain rice, and rumors circulate in the market that this rice is of Japanese origin. According to Chengjin, a member of the industry, the goods were purchased from the American trading company Handao Lai, and are goods delivered from the warehouse. The focus of this case should first clarify whether the goods were shipped by a Japanese ship or a Western ship, which is the prerequisite for resolving this case. It was resolved that the small-grain rice purchased by the eight shops should be temporarily kept by this association, and the true nature of the goods should be investigated. Fang Yusheng and Chen Shide were immediately appointed as investigators to conduct a thorough investigation. If it is confirmed that the rice was shipped by a Japanese ship, the profits from the future sale of the rice will be used by this association for charitable purposes, and the losses will be borne by the eight shops. If it is found that the rice was shipped by a Western ship, the profits should be returned to the Chengjin members. However, only three of the eight shops were present at today's meeting, and consent was obtained from them. If the remaining five shops express dissent, it will be discussed again. It is also noted that domestic agricultural production has been bountiful in recent years, and rice prices have plummeted. The fundamental way to rescue rural areas is to boycott the dumping of foreign rice. Therefore, members should refuse to buy and sell Japanese rice from Japanese merchants. As for goods from Western merchants, this association should also advise members to temporarily stop ordering and strive to rescue agriculture together. These are the matters recorded and announced, and it is hoped that all members of the association will be informed.</p>
<p>Public Indignation at the End of the Meeting: When the meeting was adjourned, a broker nicknamed "Old Bibao" was walking from the third floor to the second-floor market when he was scolded by the members, who called him a traitor. This led to a quarrel, and teapots and teacups were thrown all over the market. People later persuaded them to disperse. After Shenfeng and the other eight shops violated the Grain Industry Association's resolution and sold a large quantity of Japanese rice, outsiders questioned them. Yesterday morning, slogans expressing indignation were posted all over Doushi Street and in front of the shops.</p>

<p>A Central News Agency reporter visited Wen Yuqing, Director of the International Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, yesterday morning to inquire about the report from the Japanese Rengo News Agency regarding the Chinese government's cancellation of the Shuangqiao Radio Station contract. The reply was as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e125">Shuangqiao Radio Station Contract <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>In 1918, the Navy Department of the Beijing government signed a contract with the Japanese Mitsui &amp; Co. for the Shuangqiao Radio Station. The contract stipulated the construction of a long-wave radio station in Beiping. The station was built many years ago but has not yet been put into operation. As for the Tokyo dispatch from the Japanese Rengo News Agency that the Chinese government has cancelled this contract, causing the Japanese Foreign Ministry to demand 5 million yuan in construction fees, I have not heard of this. The cancellation of this contract and the related negotiations should be handled jointly by the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Navy, and Communications.</p>

<p>Preparations for the International Telecommunications Bureau to establish Sino-British telecommunications are actively underway. One transmitter has already arrived in Shanghai and its assembly has been completed. Another transmitter is expected to arrive in Shanghai within two weeks. Once it arrives, it will be transported to Zhenru for installation. The exact date for the start of Sino-British telecommunications is set for New Year's Day next year. The students sent by the Ministry of Communications to study radio in England will be reporting to the bureau for service soon.</p>

<p>Wen also mentioned that international telecommunications have already been established with Germany, France, Russia, Italy, the United States, and the Netherlands. Telecommunications with Hong Kong are expected to be realized within the year. In order to expedite telecommunications between Shanghai and Hong Kong, an engineer was recently sent to Shanghai to inspect the equipment at the Hong Kong radio station.

<h3 id="e129">Reorganization of the Shanghai Savings and Remittance Bureau <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Internal Implementation Already Underway; Official Cancellation on New Year's Day</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Postal Economic System Research Committee, the reorganization of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau under the Postal Administration has been discussed repeatedly. A draft plan was submitted by the committee to the Executive Yuan for discussion at the Central Political Conference. The principle of merging has been decided, and the relevant agencies are preparing for the merger procedures. For the sake of consolidation, the Ministry of Communications has ordered the Shanghai Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau to merge its operations with the Postal Administration. A Central News Agency reporter inquired about this with the person in charge of the bureau, and received the following response:</p>
<h3 id="e130">Merger <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>According to the person in charge, the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau was originally directly under the Ministry of Communications, with branches established in Shanghai, Hankou, and Tianjin, and savings and remittance offices attached to post offices in various locations. Recently, the Central Government decided to reorganize the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau under the Postal Administration. Currently, the merger procedures are still taking time and may not be realized soon. For the sake of consolidation, the Ministry of Communications has ordered the Shanghai Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau to merge its operations with the Postal Administration. Internal implementation of the merger and consolidation is already underway. However, due to accounting and other reasons, the official cancellation of the Shanghai Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau will be at the end of the year. All operations are still being conducted as usual and are not affected in the slightest.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Announcement <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>The Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau announces that the issue of the reorganization of this bureau under the Postal Administration has been decided by the Central Political Conference. All regulations are currently being reviewed and will be implemented after being formulated and promulgated in accordance with legislative procedures. We have received an order from the Ministry of Communications to first abolish the Shanghai Savings and Remittance Bureau and merge all operations with this bureau in order to achieve economy and demonstrate consolidation. Except for internal affairs, the merger has already been implemented in accordance with the order. However, due to accounting and other reasons, the name of the Shanghai Savings and Remittance Bureau will be cancelled from January 1, year 23 [1934]. From that date onwards, all external operations will continue to be conducted directly under the name of this bureau. As for the tickets, seals, deposit slips, etc. used, as the names may change after the reorganization to avoid repeated modifications, everything will be used as before. This is a special announcement.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Postal Workers' Indignation Towards Liu and Yang <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Sparks Urgent Postal Workers' Movement to Recover Savings and Remittance Bureau</p>
<p>According to news from the two postal workers' unions, the former directors of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, Liu Shufan and Yang Jianping, were found to be derelict of duty and corrupt in office, embezzling large sums of money. The Control Yuan has filed an impeachment, and the court is conducting a public prosecution. The two postal workers' unions advocate strict punishment and urge the government to recover the Savings and Remittance Bureau to prevent future problems. Yesterday, important committee members of the two postal workers' unions claimed that the discovery of the Liu and Yang corruption case was a great misfortune for society. We cannot condone Liu and Yang and sincerely hope that the Control Yuan and the judiciary will handle the case impartially and give them the punishment they deserve under the law to maintain the government's credibility. However, in terms of solidifying postal savings and remittance, this is only a palliative measure. If we want the position of postal savings to be permanently solid and prevent the continued discovery of corruption cases, there is no other way than to thoroughly recover the Savings and Remittance Bureau. Only by merging the Savings and Remittance Bureau into the Postal Administration can the business operate soundly and the public's confidence be established. Otherwise, the collapse of the postal savings and remittance business can be expected to happen soon. Since the Savings and Remittance Bureau was established separately, all the measures taken by the bureau have been contrary to the practices of postal personnel in terms of system and spirit. The errors are too great to bear to speak of. The Liu and Yang corruption is only one example. If the government does not make a decisive decision soon, the money invested may be lost. A reporter inquired about the news reported yesterday that the Ministry of Communications has ordered the abolition of the Shanghai Savings and Remittance Bureau and asked about the union's attitude towards this news. The reply was that although it is somewhat late, the fact that the Ministry of Communications can make a decisive decision at this time can also be seen as the authorities' quick stop to the situation, which we are happy to hear. However, the news of the Savings and Remittance Bureau's merger has been announced more than once, and we hope that the authorities will show the facts to the public as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Chen Qinglu, Employee of Shanghai Power Company, Suddenly Assassinated Yesterday Morning <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Three Assailants Lay in Wait Near Chen's Residence</p>
<p>First Taken to Yinxing Port and Then Forced into a Car to Shijia浜</p>
<p>Six or Seven Shots Fired; Chen Hit by Three Bullets and His Life in Danger</p>
<p>City Police Authorities Intensively Searching for the Murderers</p>
<p>At around 10 AM yesterday morning, an assassination occurred at Shijia浜 on Mayushan Road, Yinxing Port, in Pudong. The victim was Chen Qinglu, an employee of the Shanghai Power Company. During the recent labor unrest at the company, employees contacted workers to strike in order to pressure the company to recognize the workers' demands. However, in recent days, many employees have gradually returned to work due to pressure from the company. Chen was one of those who voluntarily returned to work, which made him resented by some parties. Yesterday morning at 9 AM, assassins were secretly sent to ambush Chen at the location and shot him with handguns, intending to murder him. The injured person was found by patrol officer Zhang Yulong of the Fourth Precinct of the Fifth District, who took him to the Sacred Heart Hospital for treatment. It is said that his life is in danger. The details of the investigation are recorded below:</p>
<p>[P] Chen's Family Background</p>
<p>Chen Rongqing, a local resident, is 65 years old and runs a cotton-fluffing shop called Chen Wanxing in Houjia浜 in the city. He lives at No. 24 in Beizhangjia Lane. His wife, Li, is 67 years old and has two sons and a daughter. The eldest son, Chen Qingfu, is 33 years old and works as an employee at the Shanghai Power Company. His wife, Wang, is 28 years old and has a son and a daughter. The son is named Maotou and is 4 years old, and the daughter is named Peijuan and is 9 years old. The second child is a daughter, Chen Huizhen, who is 30 years old and married to a man surnamed Li. The youngest child is a son, Chen Qinglu, who is currently 22 years old. He was introduced to the Shanghai Power Company by his elder brother and has been working as an employee in the materials department for many years. With the support of his parents, he was engaged to a woman surnamed Jin through a matchmaker, but they have not yet married. The family of several people has a fairly comfortable life.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Sudden Encounter with Assailants <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>At around 8 AM yesterday morning, Chen Qinglu left home as usual and hired a rickshaw to go to the Shanghai Power Company at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Jiangxi Road to work. However, before he had gone far, three assailants wearing blue short shirts and pants stopped the rickshaw and ordered him to get out, saying that they wanted to talk to him at a certain labor union in the Jiangye Guild Hall on Fuyou Road. He was forced to get out of the rickshaw and walk to the guild hall. After sitting there for about 20 minutes, the assailants suddenly told Chen that they wanted to talk to a certain organization at Yinxing Port. Although Chen was unwilling, he could not do anything. He then went out of the guild hall with the assailants. At this time, the assailants had already called Yunfei Motor Company and hired a car with license number 12323, which was parked in front of the guild hall. The driver, Jin Ronghua, did not pay attention, but saw Chen get into the car with the assailants. Then, under the direction of the assailants, the car sped to Shijia浜 on Mayushan Road, Yinxing Port, in Pudong.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Shooting <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>The assailants then ordered the car to stop. It was already past 10 AM. They then forced Chen out of the car, and one of the assailants paid the driver Jin two yuan and four jiao. Jin then turned the car around and drove back the way he came. The assailants then held Chen Qinglu and walked forward for dozens of steps. The area was remote, and the assailants pulled out handguns and shot Chen. A total of six or seven shots were fired, with Chen being hit once in the chest, head, and right leg. He was injured in an instant, blood flowed profusely, and he fell to the ground in extreme pain. The assailants, seeing that their goal had been achieved, scattered and fled. Fortunately, patrol officer Zhang Lianglong of the Fourth Precinct of the Fifth District, accompanied by police chief He Shaoxiang, was patrolling and found Chen Qinglu lying in a pool of blood, barely breathing. They then helped him up and took him to the Sacred Heart Hospital at No. 41 Yangshupu Road for treatment.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Serious Injuries <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>On one hand, the bureau chief Jū Jìng was notified, and a large number of police officers were dispatched to search everywhere.</p>
<p>However, because of the time that had passed, the assailant was not caught. In the middle of the search, Inspector Zhāng and others, seeing that Chén had suffered severe injuries but was still conscious, asked for his name and occupation. Immediately, they used the telephone to notify the power company. Before long, they arrived at Sacred Heart Hospital, sending him into ward number 90. There, Doctor Hóu Yúnqīng of the hospital diagnosed him. He discovered that Chén had been shot once in the left chest, which was the most serious wound. The bullet entered through the back, pierced through the lung, and exited from the front chest. Another bullet had hit the right leg, entering straight from the buttock, but had not yet exited. The head had only been grazed slightly by a bullet. He immediately performed surgery, managing to extract the bullet from his leg. However, the injuries were still severe, and his life was in danger. Around 2 PM, Chén's family learned of what had happened. His older brother, Qìngfú, rushed to the hospital to visit him. Because Chén was in an ordinary ward, he negotiated with Sacred Heart Hospital to move him to a first-class ward. At the same time, he planned to have Doctor Niú Huìlín treat him. The Yángshùpǔ police station, having received a report from the power company, also dispatched detectives to Sacred Heart Hospital to investigate and inquire about the assailant's clothing and appearance from Chén in order to pursue him. The Municipal Public Security Bureau had also ordered all the detectives to investigate everywhere, so this case will not be difficult to solve.</p>

<h3 id="e137">YMCA Held the Greater Shanghai Construction Movement Yesterday <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Acting Mayor Yú Hóngjūn Speaks on the Greater Shanghai Plan</p>
<p>The Shanghai YMCA held the opening day of the Greater Shanghai Construction Movement yesterday. In the reading room of the YMCA, models and charts of various construction plans for the city center were displayed. From 10 AM to 9 PM, visitors came in an endless stream and it was extremely crowded. At 5:30 PM, there was a opening ceremony, and Mayor Wú was invited to give a speech. However, because Mayor Wú had just returned from Nánjīng and Shànghǎi and had other important matters, Secretary-General Yú Hóngjūn was delegated to attend and give a speech titled "(The Greater Shanghai Plan)." There was no ceremony at the opening. After the chairman introduced him, Yú immediately began his speech, saying, "Today, the YMCA is holding the Greater Shanghai Construction Movement. Mayor Wú originally intended to come in person to report to everyone, but because the mayor has just returned to Shànghǎi from Nánjīng and also has temporary urgent matters to deal with, he was unable to come in person, so I, as a brother, am representing him. Although Mayor Wú did not come in person, his spirit of construction is completely in line with everyone. Now, with the national crisis at hand, everyone in the country agrees that only construction can strengthen the country and save the nation. Therefore, the greatness of the spirit and the far-sightedness of the vision of the Greater Shanghai Construction Movement is enough to make us admire it. At the same time, I also feel that there are many enlightened people among the general public, but there are also quite a few who are living in a dream, indulging in ease and comfort. At this time, when everyone's work is completed, originally it should be a time for rest and entertainment, but they are willing to spend their precious time here to listen to the mayor's speech, which shows that they are extremely concerned about the construction of this city. If this kind of spirit can be displayed by the people of the whole country, then the future of China will certainly be very promising. As for the five characters of 'Greater Shanghai Construction,' those who do not know or are old in Shànghǎi will think that Shànghǎi has Shànghǎi City and Shànghǎi County, and at the same time, there are also the Public Concession and the French Concession, two special districts. Those who travel from Cáo Jiādù to the Concession and the city center must say they are going to Shànghǎi, and those who cross the Pǔjiāng River from the Concession to the city area must say they are going to Pǔdōng. But in fact, the area covered by the two characters 'Shànghǎi' is extremely broad and definitely not as narrow as that. Therefore, the meaning and future of Greater Shànghǎi contain unlimited hope. Everyone should observe that along the river in the existing concession area, most of the wharves belong to foreigners, and as a result, China's shipping industry has no way to develop. But foreigners also feel that within the concession, the land is small and the population is large, and there is no way to further develop. Therefore, they have taken the action of building roads beyond the boundary to seek expansion. However, why does the Greater Shànghǎi Plan not start with the existing urban areas of Zháběi and Nánshì, but instead looks for a new city center in the current city center area? Because it is easier to reorganize the old city center area, but it is very difficult to carry out a thorough reform. Therefore, in order to avoid being restricted by the environment, a new city center area is established near Jiāngwān to be the center of the entire city. This place is east of Pǔdōng, south of the concession, north of Wúsōng, and west of Zhēnrú. It has a deep-water port by the river where wharves can be built, and light railways can be built to connect water and land transportation. Commerce is extremely convenient. Usually, public buses travel to and from the city area in only twenty minutes, which is not much different from the time it takes to travel to and from the current municipal government. The cost of housing is low, and the air is fresh, making it very suitable for people to live in. Therefore, the municipal government is also greatly concerned about the housing problem for citizens. The municipal government has always not regarded publicity as its work, but regards work as publicity and actively carries it out. Although it has been hit by the January 28th Incident, it still tries its best to carry on. Now, the main roads have gradually been completed, and the new buildings of the municipal government were completed during the recent Mid-Autumn Festival. However, some people doubt why the municipal government's buildings are so magnificent, but in fact, it only seeks to be solid. Although the appearance is designed to impress future prosperity and development, the cost is not very high. On the other hand, in order to make the citizens believe, it must be done in this way to let the citizens know that the municipal government is truly sincere and not perfunctory, and to jointly assist the government in carrying out the project, for the sake of a permanent solution. Now, the water and electricity have been completely equipped. The second step of the plan is scheduled to be officially moved in on January 1st of next year, which will further strengthen the citizens' trust, so that the people will unite and build residential areas. The third step of the plan is to build the Yángzikǒu Commercial Port, build the Pǔjiāng Railway Bridge to connect Pǔdōng transportation, etc., all of which are the most important things in the plan. In short, foreigners have said that the prosperity of Rome cannot be achieved in one day. Therefore, the Greater Shanghai Plan cannot be achieved by a few colleagues in the municipal government alone. It requires everyone to work together, think for the public, and not make empty promises, and then nothing will be impossible."</p>

<p>Dàgōngshè reports that the eight-province grain conference of Sūzhè, Yuè, È, Gàn, Xiāng, Lǔ, and Wǎn, convened by Chairman Jiǎng in Nánchāng, was originally scheduled to open yesterday. However, because the conference venue and the agenda had not yet been fully arranged, it was changed to tomorrow (the 22nd). The local government was also summoned to participate. Mayor Wú had previously appointed Wú Huánrú, the head of the second section of the Social Affairs Bureau, and Zhōu Mínggāng, a staff member of the fourth section, as representatives on the 16th of this month to attend in Gàn. Now, the municipal government has received a telegram from the two representatives requesting that a representative who is familiar with the dumping tax on foreign rice and the situation of the rice industry in Guǎngdōng Province be added, so that they can contribute as much opinions as possible at the conference. Therefore, the municipal government specially appointed Gù Shēngyī, the chairman of the Soybean and Rice Trade Association, as a representative. After being appointed, Gù left by car last night to go to Běijīng and then to Gàn to attend the conference.</p>

<p>The Wusong Merchant Marine College of the Ministry of Communications was founded in the late Qing Dynasty. At that time, the person who managed and planned it to completion was Admiral Sà Dǐngmíng, a veteran of the navy. Sà also presided over the school administration for many years, so today many of the teachers of the school are his former students. In the middle of several changes, it was suspended. In 1929, as a result of the efforts of former President Yáng Zhì , it was restored. After the January 28th Incident, most of the school buildings were destroyed. Now, President Xú Jìjié is working hard to restore it, and the school buildings have been rebuilt. In the past two years, the school affairs have been showing a trend of increasing strictness and improvement. Now, the teachers and students of the school took the opportunity of Sà's coming to Shànghǎi for disaster relief for the people of Mǐn Province, and held a general assembly yesterday morning (the 20th) to welcome him, and invited Sà to give a speech, the general idea of which was to work hard to cultivate dangerous spirit, and create useful talents for the country. It was extremely prosperous. Then, former President Yáng gave a speech, especially paying attention to the item of physical education. Finally, President Xú gave a thank you speech, and then the whole group took a photo. It was not until the afternoon that they dispersed happily.</p>

In addition to stating the original facts of the petition, the representative also stated that this matter is related to the livelihood of more than 100,000 farmers in Qióngyá. If the authorities cannot give a satisfactory solution, the sugar industry will inevitably decline, the rural economy will go bankrupt, and the future of Qióngyá's security will be unimaginable.

<p>Fùxīngshè reports that Kǒng Kǎipíng, a Korean national and owner of the Báijì Pharmacy on Avenue Joffre, Western name (L. C. Pak), who used to be a reporter for the Dàlùbào, was arrested earlier because a Chinese-Korean named Lǐ Chéngjiǔ bought medicine at the pharmacy. Sāibó, the head of the criminal section of the Japanese consulate, immediately recognized him as having suspicious communications with Korean revolutionaries and together with the French Concession detectives, arrested Lǐ. At the same time, he summoned Kǒng to the Japanese consulate and imprisoned him in the criminal section. After Kǒng was arrested, a Western friend tried to rescue him. After a week of running around, the Japanese consulate allowed bail to be released. A reporter from Fùxīngshè visited Kǒng at the Zǐguāng Electrical Company on Běijīng Road yesterday to ask about his treatment during his imprisonment. Kǒng said it was still good, and the reason for the arrest was that the Japanese consulate mistook him for providing relief to Korean revolutionaries at that time, so once the investigation was clear, he was allowed to be released on bail.</p>

<p>The dikes in the Gāoqiáo and Wúsōng areas of this city were in danger at the beginning of last month due to the passage of a hurricane. The municipal government allocated 50,000 yuan to the Municipal Bureau of Public Works to hire workers to repair them. However, in the middle of last month, a second hurricane passed through, and the wind was even stronger than before, and the high tide was also at its peak, which caused even more damage to the east and west dikes. The Municipal Bureau of Public Works continued to rush to repair them on the one hand, and on the other hand, submitted another request to the municipal government for additional funding to facilitate the progress. The municipal government considered the importance of the dikes, and allocated another 30,000 yuan, ordering the Municipal Bureau of Public Works to quickly repair the destroyed dikes to avoid future troubles.</p>

<p>After announcing the start of the meeting, Chairman Dù Yuèshēng and Zhāng Bóchū reported on the work items: (1) Shěn, the director of the Jiāngsū Construction Department, replied by telegram regarding the Gongzhen matter, saying that Yuán had already sent someone to investigate and inspect, and after replying, he would urge the county chiefs to rush to raise funds for construction. (2) The association has received relief funds, and as of the 19th, it has been reported and thanked. As for the third notice, a total of 17,180.2 yuan has been received. (3) On the 16th, the association transported 532 bags of relief rice to Chuānshā, valued at 3,495.1 yuan. Also, Lù Bóhóng previously handled 513 shí and 1.9 shēng of rice from the Wànchāng Rice Shop, and the price, including labor, totaled 3,457.054 yuan, which has been advanced and should be reimbursed by the association. (4) Nánhuì County submitted the first report form of relief items received directly (mid-month), listing a total of three items: 200 bags of white rice from Hùnán Charity, and two shipments of corn from the Chinese and Foreign Relief Association, totaling 27,000 jīns. Lù Bóhóng said that the Chinese and Foreign Relief Association had transported 1,000 bags of white rice, but it was not listed, and a letter has been sent to the Nánhuì County Chief to inquire whether it was received. (5) The association received 100 sets of cotton clothes and trousers from the Rénjìtáng, designated by the Tóngrén Fǔyuántáng to donate to Nánhuì. The previous report mistakenly stated 50 sets, which should be corrected.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Discussion Items <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>After the report was completed, the discussion continued: (1) The repairs must be carried out during the small flood period. If it passes from the 24th of this month to the end of the month (that is, the sixth to twelfth day of the ninth lunar month), if the flood control project is not completed, it will be too late to plant wheat and broad beans. The reports from the counties are different, but the sandbars isolated in the sea are more urgent than the coastal areas of the mainland. If we wait for the completion of the review before discussing the construction, it will inevitably delay the planting of the small ripe crops. Should we make some changes and allocate at least the necessary funds to each county and inform them by telegram, limiting them to start work immediately within the small flood period next week, while at the same time having the engineering inspectors go to investigate the case separately? (Resolution) The association will allocate loans to the five counties, which will be properly handled by the local gentry of the five counties to rush to repair the dike breaches. The five counties will be supervised by their respective county governments. The allocation is estimated to be 15,000 yuan for Chuānshā, 7,000 yuan for Nánhuì, 18,000 yuan for Chóngmíng, 12,000 yuan for Bǎoshān, and 20,000 yuan for Qǐdōng. (2) The Nánhuì County Chief requested by telegram to issue seed grain, but there was no number. The Chuānshā County Chief informed by letter that the Hall of Consultations was separately verifying the seeds and would report by the end of the month. He also said that it is advisable to take this opportunity to select and distribute good seeds, which can improve agricultural production. Also, the Bǎoshān office reported that the sand-producing rice of each sand bank said that in addition to obtaining relief rice, the tenants will have three to four tenths of the rice this year. As long as the dikes can be repaired and the small ripe crops can be planted, there will be no problem next year. As for cotton and cotton seeds, it is a matter for next spring. Should we issue small ripe seeds now, or wait for the counties to report the exact number and type before reviewing and approving the case? (Resolution) After the counties report the exact number and type, we will review and approve the allocation. (3) The Nánhuì County Acting Chief requested by telegram to allocate 10,000 sets of cotton clothes and trousers, and the Chuānshā County requested by letter to issue 7,000 sets of cotton clothes and trousers. The Bǎoshān Office reported that assuming that one set of cotton clothes and trousers is issued for every two people, a total of 5,276 sets are required. The association has rushed to make 30,000 sets of cotton clothes and trousers, and 5,000 sets of cotton clothes and trousers for disaster-stricken children. How should they be distributed? Please make a public decision on the case. (Resolution) After Chóng and Qǐ counties report, they will be reviewed and issued. (4) The Chóngmíng County Party Committee Executive Committee sent a letter requesting to release winter relief. How should it be handled? Please make a public decision on the case. (Resolution) Temporarily postpone the discussion. The rest of the discussion was completed, and the meeting was adjourned.</p>

<p>Zhāng Xiǎomèi, a woman from Yíxīng, is 21 years old and slightly attractive. When she was 18, in the autumn, she married Bì Fèngshēng, a plasterer from Chángzhōu. They lived in Zhōujiāqiáo Village, Yángshùpǔ, and the affection between the couple was harmonious. However, because the family gradually became poor, Bì became ill in January of this year, making it even more difficult to make a living. He quarreled with his wife every day. Xiǎomèi angrily went out to a broker near the Great World and was introduced to work as a helper at Wang's mansion, No. 19 Jiājí Road, French Concession. She sent a letter to her husband. Because Bì was unable to support her, he had to let her do as she pleased. Unexpectedly, Zhāng Xiǎomèi recently became acquainted with Jīn Liùgēn, a rogue from the same village, and rented a small house on Běihǎi Road. They were as loving as a couple, living together day and night. Later, because their income could not meet their expenses, and all their money was gone, there was no way to support themselves. Then there was Gù Quángēn, a man from Wúxī, who was 23 years old and still unmarried. He lived in a bungalow on Dàliánwān Road and worked as a tinsmith. He was very honest. Jīn Liùgēn knew about him and asked two friends, Shěn Bǐnghuá and Wú Shàoxiān, to act as matchmakers. He falsely changed Zhāng Xiǎomèi's surname to Jīn, posing as his younger sister, and married her to Gù Quángēn for a betrothal gift of 140 yuan. They got married at the nearby Tàihé Restaurant on the 17th of this month. The day before, the original husband, Bì Fèngshēng, discovered the truth and asked Shěn Bǐnghuá, who was acting as the matchmaker. A big conflict broke out. Shěn's wife, Zhū, secretly reported to the Yúlín Road Police Station, who sent Detective Wū Wéndá to investigate clearly. He immediately brought the woman, Jīn Xiǎomèi, to the police station and sent her to the women's prison for temporary detention. Yesterday morning, she was escorted to the Criminal Court No. 3 of the First Special District Court. Attorney Zhāng Tiānyīn of the police station explained the situation in detail and said that the offender Jīn Liùgēn was at large and could not be arrested, and Gù Quángēn married the defendant as his wife, and there was a marriage certificate, which was presided over by Jīn Liùgēn. He submitted the certificate for inspection, saying that the police station accused the defendant of bigamy according to Article 254 of the Criminal Law and filed a public prosecution, and that Jīn Liùgēn and the defendant had colluded to commit the crime, requesting strict punishment. Then, Bì Fèngshēng and Gù Quángēn stated the process. Wú Shàoxiān, Gù's matchmaker, said that the betrothal gift was handed over to Jīn Liùgēn, and he did not know that there were such entanglements. When questioned, the defendant confessed that she was fooled by Jīn Liùgēn, saying that she would pay the money to her original husband, Bì Fèngshēng, to break off the relationship. The rest of the confession was vague. Judge Liú Yùguì sentenced Jīn Xiǎomèi, that is, Zhāng Xiǎomèi, to five months imprisonment as a warning.</p>

<p>Lu Fengzhu Sentenced to Two Years Imprisonment, Will Appeal</p>
<p>Lu Fengzhu, former Executive Committee Member of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce and current committee member of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and General Manager of the Zhonghua Printing House, was recently sentenced to two years imprisonment by the Criminal Division of the First Special District Court for counterfeiting documents. The details of this case are unusually complex and significant, involving litigation that has lasted for several years. The reporter, after several days of investigation, has recorded the findings below. The case originates from the Zhonghe Bank in Chongqing, Sichuan, which was established by Liu Xiang and other military and business figures. In the 15th year of the Republic (1926), to facilitate financial circulation in the market, the bank's board of directors resolved to issue (non-interest-bearing certificates), with a face value of 3 million yuan. Due to the lack of sophisticated printing facilities in Sichuan, Sun Shubei, the bank's general manager, entrusted Tang Bingzhang, then of the Shanghai Yuchang Match Factory, to contact the Commercial Press for printing the certificates. Wang Hongbin, the factory director of Yuchang Factory, knew Xi Yanggao, the manager of the Great China Printing Bureau. Wang introduced Tang, and after satisfactory negotiations, the Great China Printing Bureau was commissioned to undertake the printing. It was specified that 800,000 certificates would be printed, with 200,000 being 10-yuan certificates, 100,000 being 5-yuan certificates, and 500,000 being 1-yuan certificates. Later, the bank instructed that the number of 1-yuan certificates be reduced by 50,000 and the number of 5-yuan certificates be increased by 50,000, increasing the face value to 3.2 million yuan. A contract was signed, specifying that the printing plates used would be intaglio, the paper would be American banknote paper, the printing fee would be 31,200 yuan, and the original plates would be destroyed after printing. However, the Zhonghe side, deeply concerned about potential fraud such as underreporting the quantity and the appearance of counterfeit certificates with the same plates and paper, required the Great China Printing Bureau to provide a guarantee. Xi Yanggao then enlisted Lu Fengzhu to act as a guarantor, stipulating that if any of the above events occurred in the future, the Great China Printing Bureau and Lu Fengzhu would be liable for compensating all losses. If it was found that the fraud was committed by someone within the printing bureau, they would be sent to court for prosecution and no leniency would be shown. Therefore, the signatories on the contract were Tang Bingzhang, representing Zhonghe, Xi Yanggao, representing Great China, Lu Fengzhu of the Zhonghua Printing House as the guarantor, Liu Yingcai and Wang Hongbin as witnesses, and Xi Yuquan as the contract drafter. These certificates were fully paid off from the time they were printed until the 20th year of the Republic (1931), and were issued by Zhonghe Bank. Not long after they circulated in the market, a large number of counterfeit certificates with the same serial numbers were discovered. Consequently, in the 21st year of the Republic (1932), Zhonghe, with the approval of the 21st Army Headquarters and the Chongqing Municipal Government, recalled the certificates. Unexpectedly, Liao Yinxiian, a section chief of the Army Headquarters, ordered someone to present 1,000 yuan worth of Zhonghe 10-yuan certificates for redemption. After examination by the bank, they were found to be counterfeit. When questioned about their origin, they claimed to have obtained them from a Chen's jade shop on Mihua Street. An investigation was conducted at the jade shop, which revealed that they had been obtained from Wang Hongbin's home at No. 64 Yangliu Street. Sun Shubei, the general manager of Zhonghe, immediately reported this to the Public Security Bureau. The bureau chief, She Zili, led police officers, accompanied by local gentry and officials, to Wang's home for a search. Wang and his wife, Shuzhen, were found collecting luggage, preparing to flee. They were immediately arrested, and 57,140 yuan worth of counterfeit certificates and a small leather suitcase were found. Wang Hongbin was found in the suitcase.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Criminal Sentence for Leaked Exam Questions <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>During the Shanghai Municipal Middle School Entrance Examination, it was discovered that student Xie Ying had pre-copied exam questions. After investigation, it was found that when the Bureau of Education entrusted the Nanjing Printing Company to print the exam questions, the company owner, Zhang Jieliang, had given the questions to Xie Ying's brother, Xie Zhen. They were both immediately taken into custody and prosecuted by the District Court. After the debate concluded, Judge Qian announced the verdict yesterday: Zhang Jieliang was sentenced to six months imprisonment for misappropriating items held in his professional capacity; Xie Zhen was sentenced to four months imprisonment for inciting misappropriation; and Xie Ying was sentenced to two months imprisonment for receiving stolen goods, with each sentence suspended for one year.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Bao Rongtang and Son, Owners of Longxing Gold Shop, Sued; Mrs. Yang Accuses Father-in-Law of Cutting Off Expenses; Demands 30,000 Yuan for Support and Division of Inheritance <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Second Hearing Yesterday, Defendants Still Failed to Appear, Postponement Again</p>
<p>Bao Jianfu, owner of Longxing Gold Shop on Edward Road, is the eldest grandson of Bao Aofeng, the founder of Yingfeng Qianzhuang, a financial institution in Xian Gua Street in the city, which has been established for nearly 70 years and is considered a pioneer in the financial world in Shanghai. Aofeng had two sons, the elder named Rongtang and the younger Wenwei. Rongtang also had two sons, the elder being Jianfu and the younger Qiankui. Wenwei, however, had no offspring, so Qiankui was adopted as his heir. However, Qiankui suddenly passed away in the 6th year of the Republic (1917) shortly after marrying Mrs. Yang, following his grandfather and father (adoptive father). Therefore, Aofeng's entire estate of six or seven hundred thousand yuan was controlled by Rongtang and Jianfu. Rongtang is now old and resides in a self-purchased Western-style house at No. 72 Chunpingfang, Hedde Road in West Shanghai, enjoying a comfortable and prestigious life, spending his remaining years in leisure. He has entrusted all household affairs to his son, Jianfu, who has been able to arbitrarily dispose of the family property. Longxing Gold Shop is ostensibly opened by Jianfu with his own funds, but the capital is actually misappropriated from the property jointly owned with Mrs. Yang. It is only because he deceives Mrs. Yang, a woman, that he dares to do whatever he wants. Not long after her husband's death, she gave birth to a posthumous daughter, who unfortunately died young. She then raised a son, determined to remain chaste and raise her son so that he could inherit the property that her late husband should have received. For more than ten years, despite being discriminated against by her father-in-law and brother-in-law, she has only been given meager living expenses, barely enough for congee. She has endured hardships and swallowed her voice in silence, spending her days in monotony and misery, refraining from arguing with them. Unexpectedly, Rongtang and his son have taken advantage of the widow's weakness and suddenly cut off the meager living expenses they had been providing on April 1st of this year, leaving Mrs. Yang destitute. Faced with this oppression, she has no choice but to resort to the law in the hope of preserving her life. She has retained lawyer Hu Jue to represent her in filing a lawsuit with the First Special District Court, accusing her father-in-law Bao Rongtang and brother-in-law Bao Jianfu of failing to provide support and of privately selling off the inheritance, requesting the court to order a division of the property and payment of 30,000 yuan in support. She argues that the defendants disregard the feelings for her late husband and are not only unpitying but also unusually harsh. The property that the plaintiff should have inherited under the name of her late husband's uncle, Wenwei, has also been entirely misappropriated by the defendants and secretly sold off, yielding tens of thousands of yuan. Even based on joint property rights, it is invalid under the law without obtaining the plaintiff's consent and signature. The defendants have seized this ancestral property for themselves and indulged in luxurious living with beautiful wives and concubines, while oppressing and threatening others, bullying widows and orphans. In addition to Wenwei's property, there is also jointly inheritable property, which she fears may be continuously sold off secretly. She requests the court to order the defendants to hand over all of the property, distribute it fairly, and pay a lump sum of 30,000 yuan for support. The case has already been heard once, but the defendants failed to appear, so it was postponed until yesterday for another hearing. However, the defendants, Bao Rongtang and his son, still failed to appear, making it impossible to begin the hearing. Judge Qiao then ordered that the case be rescheduled and the defendants be summoned to court again for questioning.</p>
<p>And the joint guarantee contract of Wu Fu Company signed by his younger brother Zhi’an, Xi Youtao (namely Xi Yuquan), Lu Fengzhu, Chen Yiting, etc. The content of the contract is to sell the Golden Beauty Ju Xin brand cigarettes. After Wang was arrested, he confessed in front of Tang Dizhi, the director of the finance department of the army headquarters, She Zili, the director of the Public Security Bureau, Zeng Ziwei, the division commander, and Wen Shaohe, the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, that he, Lu Fengzhu, Xi Yanggao, Xi Youtao, and Chen Yiting had overprinted and used the original Zhonghe certificates and were willing to use the property to compensate. An investigation revealed that the contract for selling cigarettes by the Wufu Company contained many questionable words, such as "border flowers (new and old colors)" and "(overprinting)", which are not necessary for cigarettes, and that a profit of more than 50,000 was made in a short period of time, which is impossible for sales. Therefore, it is believed that this contract is a code for Wang and Xi to counterfeit and use certificates, with Golden cigarettes actually meaning full gold, Beauty having five United States, which is determined to represent the 10-yuan and 5-yuan certificates, and Juxin not existing as a brand, but must represent the 1-yuan certificates. Wang was sent to the military headquarters for brutal interrogation, and Wang was shot last year. Meanwhile, Zhonghe Bank sent representative Zeng Binghui to Shanghai, hired lawyer Tan Yigong, and sued Xi Yuquan (because Xi Yanggao had died), Lu Fengzhu, Wang Zhi’an, Chen Yiting, etc. to the First Special District Court in the 20th year of the Republic of China (1931) for forging documents and other crimes, and demanded compensation for losses of 300,000 yuan (because Zhonghe discovered counterfeit certificates (amounting to more than 370,000 yuan)). After investigation and evidence review by the Special First Court, the case was only concluded this month. Only the defendant Lu Fengzhu appeared in court, and the rest failed to be summoned. Yesterday, Judge Xue Lanru announced the judgment, the main text of which was: Lu Fengzhu was sentenced to two years imprisonment, and the trials of Xi Yuquan, Wang Zhi'an, and Chen Yiting were suspended. The attached lawsuit was transferred to the civil court for trial. During the appeal period, Lu Fengzhu was allowed to post a bail of 3,000 yuan. It is said that Lu was dissatisfied with the judgment and will appeal.</p>

<p>Liu Chuanxian, a Yangzhou native, 26 years old, a barber at the Da Zhonghua Barber Shop at No. 122 Dongxinqiao Street, French Concession, on the 27th of last month at 12:00 pm, took advantage of the fact that the Ningbo woman Chen Zhao and her husband who lived in the attic upstairs had gone out to see a play. He sneaked into the room and forcibly raped Chen Jinxian (14 years old), the younger sister of the Chen woman who was already asleep. Afterwards, he prevented the girl from crying out. The Zhang girl endured in silence and washed away the blood stains on her underwear and bedding. Later, because her lower body was injured and in pain, she told her aunt, who told the girl's elder brother and sister-in-law, who then reported to the detective Liu Achang, who was dispatched by the police, and Liu was arrested. The girl was sent to the hospital for an examination, which confirmed that she had been raped. Liu was sent to the Second Special District Court and prosecuted for the crime of obstructing public morals. All the details have been reported in various newspapers. After the court hearing, it was ordered that the victim submit the blood-stained clothing, trousers, and bedding to the court for verification. Yesterday, Judge Zhang Zhaoyou continued the trial in the Criminal Court One. According to the defendant's confession, the complainant pointed out that the time of the rape was when he was playing with friends at the Great World, but the Zhu witness he named could not be found by the court. The complainant, Chen Zhao, along with her younger sister Chen Jinxian, brought the clothing, trousers, and bedding to court, stating that the blood stains on the clothing had been washed away and could not be identified. The official ordered that the clothing be retained by the court for medical examination and that the hearing be postponed to 9:00 am on the 30th after a defense lawyer was appointed. The defendant was remanded in custody pending further instructions.</p>

<p>Gu Xiaomei, a young girl from Songjiang, 19 years old, with a beautiful appearance, came to Shanghai in June of the 20th year of the Republic of China (1931). Through the introduction of Lu Gen, a Danyang native who sells eyeglasses, she met Cai Xiaoyun, a Changzhou native who makes photo frames (34 years old). Seeing the girl's beautiful face, he became lustful and used sweet words and all kinds of temptations. Xiaomei, being young and inexperienced, was seduced. At first, they only met secretly in a concession hotel, and then he tricked her into living with him in his photo frame shop at No. 31 Yongheli, Kangti Road, French Concession. Cai employed more than ten workers and had two younger brothers, one named Xiaozhong (39 years old) and the other Xiaobing (23 years old), who both assisted in the shop. However, the three Cai brothers were inherently violent, and Cai's attitude towards Xiaomei had long changed. After she gave birth to a boy in August of last year, who died of illness on August 12th of this year, according to the lunar calendar, he began to abuse her from time to time. Every morning before 6:00 am, Xiaomei was required to get up and cook congee. One morning, she got up a little later, and Cai became furious. He punched and kicked Xiaomei and, with Xiaobing's assistance, inflicted humiliation and slapped her several times, beating her all over. He tore off her lined jacket, pushed her down the stairs, and drove her out. Xiaomei only wore a single short shirt and trousers when she left the house. Having no relatives or friends in Shanghai, she spent the night on the road and contemplated suicide. Yesterday morning, while passing the old Jiaochang in the city inside Laobei Men, she intended to commit suicide by jumping into the Huangpu River at the Bund. She was spotted by a patrol police officer from Dadongmen Post of the Third Section of the First District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, who took her to the station. After questioning by station chief Jin Dianyang, she confessed the above. He immediately ordered the arrest of Cai Xiaoyun for interrogation and handling.</p>

<p>On the morning of December 31st of last year, at around 7:00 am, the Longsheng Rice Shop at No. 244 Tiantong Road was robbed of valuables worth more than 700 yuan. The Hongkou police arrested several robbers in the case, including Zhao Yucheng and Liu Chunyi, and sent them to the First Special District Court for sentencing. Zhao confessed that Wang Xingao from Funing had supplied the firearms. The court issued an arrest warrant, but the police were unable to locate him. Around 8:00 pm the night before last, Shi En, a Chinese detective from the Hongkou police, learned that Wang was eating at the Sanhe Restaurant at No. 15 West Xinqiao Street, French Concession. He secretly went with a Western detective and, together with detectives from the local police station, arrested Wang at the address and took him to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was sent to Criminal Court Three. Zhang Tianyin, the police lawyer, recounted the previous events and presented a photo of Zhao's house showing Zhao and the defendant together. However, the defendant denied this at the police station. He requested a postponement of the case so that Zhao could be brought in to testify next time. Wang Xingao said that he had never met Zhao Yucheng before. He used to be a captain in the inspection office of the 26th Army in Zhabei, at which time he had his photo taken, or Zhao may have been standing nearby. He asked for consideration and retained three lawyers, Zheng Wenkai, Wu Linkun, and Fan Gang, to defend him. Judge Xiao Xie'fen remanded him in custody for another hearing.</p>

However, only 200 workers went to work on that day, and the remaining half still refused to resume work. On the same afternoon, they went on strike again. The capital side believed that the losses from the resumption of work and the strike were extremely heavy, so they notified the labor union to ask all workers to go to the factory to collect their unpaid wages. The factory sounded the whistle and issued the accumulated wages the day before, and all the workers all attended to resume work. Yesterday morning, the factory started, and all the workers went to the factory to work, earlier than usual. The strike dispute was resolved.</p>

<p>Since the Songhu War Zone Rehabilitation Association of the National Government allocated funds for dredging, all sections of the Puhui Pond River in West Shanghai have been completed and the dams have been opened. Small ferries come and go, and traffic in the towns along the pond has become convenient. However, the section from the Paifangwan to Tianyaoqiao dam (ie, section six) has not been dredged yet. All ferries often run aground in this section, so they can only open to Zhongshan Road and transport passengers by car. Recently, Shen Yingpeng, Gu Junjie, Li Youxian, Shen Cai Geng, Li Qixian, etc., the leaders of various public groups such as the Qishen Town Party Department, District Office, Chamber of Commerce, and various industry associations, jointly presented a ring to Song Ziwen, chairman of the National Government Songhu War Zone Rehabilitation Association, requesting that he order the Municipal Public Works Bureau to expedite the dredging in order to comfort the people's hopes and achieve complete success.

<p>All temporary houses in the Wu Song area post-war reconstruction project that occupied the road surface without permits had previously been notified by the Shanghai Municipal Public Works Bureau to remove them when the road surface was being built. Afterwards, because each household had suffered disasters and had not recovered, they requested an extension from the Wu Song Chamber of Commerce and the Municipal Office, and disputes arose. This was reported in the previous newspaper. Subsequently, Municipal Committee Tang Chengzong reported the situation to the Public Works Bureau, asking for consideration of the merchants' difficulties and granting an extension, and requesting that demolition fees be issued to each demolition household. The Public Works Bureau approved the extension until the end of September. Those who removed the buildings by the deadline were given a demolition fee of two yuan per square meter of occupied land for a flat roof and four yuan per square meter for a multi-story building. An investigation found that a total of 53 households should be demolished, and they have been demolished or taken in order. Therefore, the route is more orderly than before. However, eight households, including Zhengtong, Gongxiangtai, and Wanlong, are still taking a wait-and-see attitude. The Public Works Bureau has ordered the Wu Song Municipal Office to notify each household that if the deadline is exceeded, the demolition fees will be cancelled and they will be ordered to remove the buildings to complete the restoration project.</p>

<p>Lu Zhulin, an investigator from the French police station, and Liu Jinrong, a prostitute, patrolled to the intersection of Min Guo Road and Maidi'an Road at 11:00 PM on the 5th of this month, and arrested Wang Zhihao from Shaoxing, who was carrying red pills privately. He was carrying six bags of red pills, totaling 6,000 pills. According to his confession, Xia Jisheng, also known as Xiao Shaoxing, the owner of the red pill shop at No. 9 Ailaige Road, entrusted him to take them somewhere to sell. When the investigators took Wang to Xia's house to search, Xia heard the sound and escaped from the roof. Only two employees, Fan Jin and Yuan Shunzi, were caught. Raw materials for red pills and pill-making equipment were seized and taken to the police station and sent to the Second Special Court for prosecution. The details of the interrogation have been recorded in previous reports. The interrogation has now concluded. Yesterday, Judge Zhang sentenced Fan Jin and Yuan Shunzi to six months of imprisonment each in the Criminal Court No. 1, with a fine of 500 yuan. Wang Zhihao was sentenced to three months of imprisonment with a fine of 300 yuan. If the fines are converted into imprisonment, each three yuan will be counted as one day.

<h3 id="e169">Guo Changxi's Case Scheduled for Sentencing <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Guo Changxi, a 26-year-old man from Yangzhou, residing at No. 97, Xinkang Lane, Kangnao Road, previously worked at the Weida Hotel opened by Chen Weida at No. 593 Xiafei Road in the French Concession, serving as a receptionist and mailman. Last month, he had a gambling dispute with his colleagues late at night, which was discovered by the French manager and reported to the hotel owner. When paying wages at the end of the month, the hotel owner wanted to deduct five jiao of wages, which Guo refused. After Guo quit, he threatened Fei Enqing, a worker who was hired later. Soon, the hotel owner also received an anonymous insulting and threatening letter, suspecting that Guo was the perpetrator, but there was no evidence to prove it. On the 9th of this month, when Guo went to the Weida Hotel to ask for a deposit slip, Chen Weida asked Guo to provide a receipt. Later, it was discovered that the "Da" character on the receipt matched the handwriting of the "Da" character on the threatening letter. Therefore, he reported it to the French police station, which sent an investigator to detain Guo on the 11th of this month and send him to the Second Special District Court for interrogation and investigation. Yesterday, Judge Zhang Chaozuo continued the trial in the Criminal Court No. 1. First, the police station's lawyer stated that the police station had investigated and the defendant denied writing the threatening letter, and no evidence was found, so the court should verify the matter. He also presented the letter as evidence. Then, the plaintiff, Chen Weida, stated that the defendant was fined for gambling and refused to quit, and often came to threaten and harass him. Later, he received a threatening letter and reported the situation to the police to arrest the defendant. When the defendant Guo Changxi was interrogated, he flatly denied writing the letter and threatening anyone. He said that he went to ask for the deposit slip on the 9th of this month and was not allowed to have it, so a dispute arose, and the hotel owner reported the case to the police and arrested him. After the court verified the confession, it announced the end of the debate and scheduled the sentencing for the 25th. The defendant was ordered to provide a reliable hotel guarantor who could be summoned at any time to await instructions.</p>

<p>Mr. Wang Yongsan has long studied medicine and is particularly proficient in chemical testing. He served as a chemical tester at Peking Union Medical College Hospital for many years. After coming to Shanghai, he served as the director of various pathological laboratories. As time passed, his experience became richer. He has now established the Chinese Pathological Laboratory on the third floor of No. 267 Jiangxi Road. Since its opening, many patients and doctors have entrusted him with chemical testing. Mr. Wang, based on his experience, performs chemical tests and examinations with great accuracy, and his service spirit is also extremely diligent. There are very few private chemical laboratories established by Chinese in this city. People like Mr. Wang not only benefit patients but also deeply assist the medical community. It is also heard that foreign doctors trust Mr. Wang very much and often send various pathological materials to him for chemical testing to assist in diagnosis.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Mayor Wu and Others Initiate the Establishment of the Chinese Anti-Tuberculosis Association <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Tuberculosis is a scourge that is most harmful. Mayor Wu, in view of the great success of various countries in organizing anti-tuberculosis groups, initiated the establishment of an anti-tuberculosis association. He has already invited more than 400 people from all walks of life in Shanghai to attend the inaugural meeting at the Municipal Government Reception Center at No. 1881 Xiafei Road at 4:00 PM yesterday. In the future, it will benefit society immeasurably. The origin of the association is recorded as follows: Tuberculosis has been a scourge for a long time, especially in our country. It is estimated that more than 1.2 million Chinese people die from this disease every year, and more than 10 million people are affected. Most of them are young and productive members of society, which has a great impact on the social economy. Fifty years ago, the prevalence of tuberculosis in European and American countries was similar to that in our country. However, due to effective prevention methods, the mortality rate has dropped sharply. For example, in the United Kingdom in 1875, the tuberculosis mortality rate was slightly less than 300 per 100,000, but now it has dropped to about 70, which is clear evidence. Today, the tuberculosis mortality rate in our country, according to surveys, is more than four times that of the United Kingdom, and 40% of children under the age of 14 are infected (according to a report by Gan Yuehan). If active prevention is not taken, how can people's livelihood be imagined? Leaders from all walks of life in Shanghai and doctors have a clearer understanding of the harm of tuberculosis, and have been consulting on prevention methods for a long time. Therefore, they have advocated organizing a national anti-tuberculosis association to actively carry out prevention work, which coincides with the long-standing reputation of Tiecheng. Considering the importance of this matter, it is difficult to achieve results without the masses and the strength of the masses to make step-by-step plans and establish a sound organization. Therefore, we invite talented people from home and abroad to jointly promote its success. We also hope that those who care about people's suffering will be happy to support it. Wu Tiecheng sincerely acknowledges.</p>

People from the Beijing-Hangzhou area are also moved and flock to Shanghai to feast their eyes. Last Saturday, more than 100 people came to Shanghai on the Beijing-Shanghai express train to see the circus. There were also many people who rushed from the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road area. It is said that this circus only performs in Shanghai during this visit to China and will not go elsewhere. After the Shanghai performances, the entire troupe will go to India. Yesterday morning, a small monkey escaped from the circus, jumping and running, from Gordon Road to Jing'an Temple Road to the intersection of Seymour Road. Passers-by gathered to watch. Later, it broke into the home of a Westerner at No. 99 Seymour Road and fought with a large cat. After the Westerner tried his best to resolve the situation, the monkey was finally captured and taken away by someone from the troupe. There are a total of 250 monkeys in the Haig Bo Circus troupe this time. They devour entire cows, swallowing two in three days, eating and grabbing, without any politeness.

<p>(Nanjing, 20th, Central News Agency) In his speech at the closing of the National Games, Chairman Wang Shijie stated, roughly, that in the past ten days, the nation's attention has been focused on a sports field in front of Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum, which is indeed a particularly exciting phenomenon for us. The efforts of everyone over the past ten days have suddenly increased the people's confidence in the future of our national revival, and increased a sense of self-confidence. At the same time, those engaged in education across the country have gained great comfort because the general public has recognized the importance of education and the magnitude of the power of education. This is the unprecedented achievement of this session of the Games. However, it is even more hoped that this achievement is not just the crystallization of the efforts of the past few years or the past ten days, but a driving force for the great efforts of the national education community in the future. We must work hard to make the future National Games show even better results in order to live up to the expectations of the nation. Therefore, as I bid farewell to everyone, I would like to propose three goals for everyone to strive for:</p>
<p>Chairman Lin presenting awards (Nanjing China)</p>
<p>(1) The goal of national educational administrative organs is to increase the number of physical education schools or departments to improve the quality of physical education teachers nationwide, and to expand physical education facilities inside and outside schools to achieve the popularization of physical education. (2) The goal of physical education teachers nationwide is to practically implement the idea of ​​cooperation between physical education and moral education, and to take responsibility for both the physical and moral health of students. (3) The goal of each athlete is to be non-romantic, non-decadent, and always maintain an optimistic attitude and a spirit of hard work, and to spread this spirit of athletes to Dong Simingtai's prizes (Nanjing China)</p>
<p>all school classmates and friends, if everyone works hard according to the above goals, the results of this National Games will be permanent, and they will occupy an eternal position in the history of the national revival. Finally, all the staff of this conference worked very hard. I, on behalf of this association, would like to express my sincere thanks. Today, we are honored that the Chairman of the National Government and the Honorary Chairman of this association, Chairman Lin, have come to give instructions and present awards. All of us in this association are deeply grateful. I wish all the referees and athletes a safe journey, and I wish the 20th National Games even greater success.</p>
<h3 id="e190">Chairman Lin's Address <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 20th, Central News Agency) Chairman Lin's address stated, in brief, that today is the day of the award ceremony and closing of the National Games. In the past ten days, we have been able to show that everyone has worked very hard. The members and those in charge have been able to cooperate closely, which is why we have achieved today's success. In particular, the team leaders, male and female athletes, have put in more effort to contribute their usual training results, creating the best results and setting a good example for the future. The weather has been good during these ten days, and it is indeed due to the success of the human element. The biggest reason for the complete success of this Games is that everyone has a spirit of cooperation, and has acted together with a spirit of courage and fearlessness, forging ahead. To make our country strong, it is of course necessary to have strong individual physiques, so that we can turn the country from weak to strong. To strengthen personal practice and self-defense, the most important thing to pay attention to is the body. Not only must it be exercised, but it is hoped that it will not be wasted. Things like smoking and alcohol, which are harmful to physical fitness, should be absolutely prohibited. This is also the foundation of self-strengthening. Various academies, departments, institutions, groups, and private individuals have donated many awards, but this is only to express a little comfort. The colleagues of the National Government have prepared a golden halberd, which is meaningful. The ancients said "lying in wait with spears as pillows," showing hatred of the enemy and unity against them. Moreover,</p>
<h3 id="e191">The Ministry of Education's Physical Education Committee Resolved: The 6th National Games Will Be Held in Shanghai on Double Tenth Festival of the Republic Year 24 <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>

It was resolved that future National Games will be held every two years in Nanjing. However, the 6th National Games will be held in Shanghai due to preparations for the Far Eastern Games venue. The meeting period is set for the Double Tenth Festival of the Republic Year 24. (5) A proposal to participate in next year's Far Eastern Games. It was resolved that this association will cooperate with the Chinese Physical Education Promotion Association. Please request the Promotion Association to draft a plan and budget, which will be transferred by the Ministry of Education to the Executive Yuan for subsidies. (6) A proposal to subsidize the Chinese National Physical Education Promotion Association. It was resolved that the Chinese Physical Education Promotion Association should draft the amount of subsidies required and send it to the Ministry of Education so that it can be requested from the government for subsidies.

(8) A proposal to continue to hold summer vacation physical education refresher courses next year was passed. Please request the Ministry of Education to organize it.</p>
<p>Speaking of the halberd against Japan, the National Government gave this halberd. Although the item is small, it is hoped that everyone's meaning is great. Today, the conference is closing. I hope that everyone will go back and tell their classmates about the situation of the next conference, what are the strengths and what are the shortcomings, and everyone will continue to work hard in sports until the next conference. When the conference is held, all the young heroes will come again to show off their skills. I wish you all a safe journey home, and I wish you all immeasurable progress in the next conference.</p>

<p>Athlete representative, Shanghai team captain Wang Wei Huai, responded that this National Games is held in the capital during a time of national crisis, which has profound significance. At the same time, it shows that the central government attaches importance to sports. During the conference, the result of the efforts of all athletes is that almost all Chinese records have been broken. This is the result of the public's training in sports. If the government and the public work together, then the progress to come is certain. In a few years, it is hoped that Chinese athletes will be on par with all countries in Europe and America.</p>

<p>(Nanjing, 20th dispatch) The National Games Competition Committee held its fourth meeting at the Ministry of Education at 3:00 PM on the 20th. Twelve people including Zhang Boqin attended. Wang Zhengting chaired the meeting. It was resolved that the Competition Committee meeting on October 8 only explained Article 15 of Chapter 10 of the Competition Rules, and did not amend it. At that time, it was recognized that the women's 400-meter relay was a team event, not an individual event (because the winner of the relay race is the team, not an individual). Therefore, this committee believes that Ms. Qian Xingsu of Shanghai did not violate the provisions of Article 15 of Chapter 10 of the Competition Rules by participating in the 400-meter relay.</p>
<h3 id="e200">Wang Shijie Hosted Banquet for Sports Experts Yesterday <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 20th dispatch) Wang Shijie hosted a banquet at the Ministry of Education at noon on the 20th for the sports experts attending this National Games. More than ten people including Chu Minyi, Wang Zhengting, Zhang Boqin, and Yuan Dunli attended. At 2:00 PM, the Central Propaganda Committee screened a silent film of the National Games at the Ministry of Education to entertain the guests. In the film, Wang Jingwei's speech, Chu Minyi leading elementary school students in Beijing in performing Tai Chi exercises, and Chu's personal performance of knife and stick skills were all spirited and lively. At 7:00 PM, Lianhua Company screened a sound film of the National Games at the Ministry of Education, inviting experts attending the National Games, with many attendees.</p>
<h3 id="e201">Final Scene of the Games <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 20th dispatch) The following are some situations after the closing of the National Games, which are worth telling to the readers, and are recorded in a miscellaneous way to mark the end.</p>
<h3 id="e202">(1) Encirclement for Lin and Wang's Signatures <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>After the closing of the National Games at noon on the 20th, Lin Sen, Wang Qingwei, Wang Shijie, Zhang Boqin, and Wang Zhengting were surrounded by athletes who requested signatures on their handbooks to keep as souvenirs. Wang signed (Work hard and strive), (Strive to be strong), (Wish you progress) and other words. At that time, there were many athletes, and Wang, Lin, and others signed one by one. After being surrounded for half an hour, Wang and others were able to escape. In the afternoon, Wang and Zeng Zhongming and others held a meeting in the field to welcome the Guangdong delegation. Wang and others each gave speeches, and dispersed after a while.</p>
<h3 id="e203">(2) Tidying Up Luggage One After Another <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>With the end of the National Games, which had been extremely grand, the athletes from various units tidied up their luggage one after another and set off separately. Inside and outside the front and rear gates of the General Assembly, luggage boxes and cages were piled up like mountains. Male and female athletes either carried scattered items or waited for the bus to depart. Those who triumphed held prizes in their hands, looking triumphant and proud, while those who failed looked sideways, looking quite frustrated. However, the prizes were huge and packed in wooden boxes due to time constraints, so they could not be done, so they were all carried with them. In addition, books, newspapers, etc. donated by various parties were bundled up, and everyone found it difficult to carry them. Yang Xiuhuan, the first choice for women's swimming in Hong Kong, wore a long crimson cheongsam, and Wang Fengjing and Wang Chunyuan, the first choices for women's tennis, wore white vests, white shoes and socks, with unparalleled charm. They attracted the most attention from the audience when they received awards.</p>
<h3 id="e204">(3) Departure Dates of Each Team <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>The departure dates of each team, as far as is known from the investigation, are recorded as follows: Zhejiang and Suiyuan set off on the evening of the 18th, and Gansu and Jiangxi left Beijing on the afternoon of the 19th. Teams from Jiangsu, Anhui, Shanghai, and Northeast China left Beijing on the morning of the 20th. Teams from Henan, Hebei, Shandong, and Shanxi set off in the afternoon of the 20th, taking the 5:00 PM special train on the Jinpu Railway back north. Teams from Fujian and Guizhou took the evening train to Shanghai. Teams from Hubei and Hunan, who left Beijing on the morning of the 21st, all took the Jiangshun Wheel west. The Sichuan team took the early train to Shanghai to visit on the 28th, and then took the Minsheng Company's Minshun Wheel back to Sichuan. Teams from Hong Kong, Guangdong, and Yunnan took the early train to Shanghai. The Qingdao team took the early train back north via the Jinpu Railway. In addition, the Philippine and Brazilian teams, due to the small number of people, all went to the Overseas Chinese Guest House and left one after another.</p>
<h3 id="e205">(4) Considerable Shipping Costs for Prizes <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>The prizes for the women's overall championship were temporarily stored at the General Assembly because the Guangdong team requested the General Assembly to retain them for the second time. After the competition committee resolves the issue, they will be claimed. This time, almost all of the men's and women's track and field ball championships were won by the Shanghai team. Most of the prizes arranged on the stage should be claimed by the Shanghai team. However, the number is very large, so the Shanghai team specially left Shao Rugan in Beijing to ask China Travel Service to pack them in boxes. It is heard that the shipping cost alone will cost hundreds of yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e206">(5) Closing of the General Assembly Office <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>Except for the General Affairs, Reception, and Transportation Groups, whose affairs were busy and continued to work as usual, the furniture and items in the Propaganda and Documents Groups' offices were moved out in the afternoon, leaving only one or two people stationed at the conference to manage them. Each section of the Competition Committee retained three cadres to stay at the conference because the conference affairs had been completed.</p>
<h3 id="e207">(6) Temporary Shops Closing <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>Except for a few food stores, which continued to operate as usual, the remaining large and small shopping malls at the General Assembly were completely closed in the afternoon. It is heard that the most developed businesses were the food stores. Within ten days, they were all full of people and extremely crowded. Now that people have left and the building is empty, I can't help but feel the contrast between the past and the present when I step on the ground. Secondly, the business of fruits and candies was also prosperous. According to the Fu Ronghe fruit stall, it made more than 1,000 yuan in business in ten days, making a considerable profit.</p>
<h3 id="e208">(7) Guangdong-Hong Kong Buji Football <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>The Guangdong-Hong Kong mixed football team is scheduled to compete with the Shanghai team at the Zhonghua Stadium on the afternoons of the 21st and 23rd. At 3:00 PM on the 22nd, the Hong Kong-Shanghai Chinese football Buji match will be held. The Hong Kong team will be represented by the South China Athletic Association football team, and will compete against the Shanghai team participating in the National Games. On the afternoon of the 24th, the Hong Kong football champion South China team will compete against the Shanghai football league champion Donghua team. In addition, Guangdong male swimmers are scheduled to compete against Shanghai Western swimmers on the 21st and 23rd.</p>
<h3 id="e209">(8) The Shi Family Army Will Return to Liaoning <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>Liaoning swimming athletes Shi Xingxi and Xinglu and their younger sister have not yet left Beijing. Soon, they will hold a Yangtze River swimming event with their eldest brother Shi Xinglong. Shi said that the Beijing municipal government does not allow assistance. I am determined to wait for a sunny day to take my younger brother and weaker sister to do this swimming, and take the opportunity to travel south. The four of them will go to Shanghai for a visit, and then return to Liaoning from Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e210">(9) Not Everything Can Be Satisfactory <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>After the meeting, a member of the organizing committee talked about the fact that not everything in this National Games was satisfactory, which has been criticized by public opinion. The propaganda team originally scheduled to host a banquet for the partners on the 21st, but it has now been cancelled. However, the weather was sunny during the meeting, and the General Assembly had the advantage of the weather, which is something that human power cannot do. The excellent results of the competition are gratifying.</p>
<h3 id="e211">(10) Reporters Are Not Included <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>In the closing speech of the Chairman Wang Shijie, he expressed his gratitude to everyone from the organizing committee down to the Boy Scouts, but he did not mention a single word about the efforts of various newspapers to expand their coverage and diligently record the events. Recalling the closing remarks of Cai Yuanpei, Jiang Menglin, and Zhu Jiahua at the Third National Education Conference and the National Physical Education Conference last year, they expressed sincere gratitude for the efforts of the news reporters. This is the difference in the speech.</p>

Students from the Martial Arts Academy performed Shaolin boxing, and preliminary tests for athletes were also held.

This is not only the glory of Shanghai, but also the glory of the citizens of Shanghai and your parents, relatives, and friends. The fate of the Republic of China depends entirely on the youth. Your efforts are not just personal efforts, but represent the efforts of the entire Republic of China.

<p>The 3rd Men's and Women's Open Competition initiated by the Chinese Race Walking Association has been scheduled for 8:00 AM next Sunday (the 29th). However, the scheduled date coincides with the National Games, which poses many difficulties in terms of external publicity and practice time, and also affects the progress of the association's affairs. However, in terms of transportation, the Chinese authorities and the British and French Concessions have approved passage and specially dispatched police to maintain order, making it difficult to postpone. In view of this, the association held a committee meeting at its location in Mu'er Hall last night, with Zhu Quan, Zhou Shanquan, Yu Shijin, Sheng Lukun, Yutian Zhang, and Zao Jiuzhang, and Zhihe Zhang and other five people to discuss and resolve as follows: (1) In the men's thirteen-mile race, in addition to individual participants, there will still be group participation to increase interest (groups limited to four people). (1) The women's two-mile race will be changed to one mile to facilitate practice. (1) Chinese representatives who have attended the International Race Walking Competition will not be allowed to participate to show promotion. (1) The male group is able to complete the entire course within two and a half hours, and the winners will be awarded the honorary president of the association, Cheng Yize, given the medal to commemorate, (1) due to short time limit for registration until next Wednesday (25th) night 9 o'clock deadline, wanted to add people to register as soon as possible,</p>

<h3 id="e231">Clothing Special Issue, Seventh Issue. True Beauty of Clothing <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>What standard do we use to judge the beauty of clothing? I think we can only distinguish it based on truth and falsehood. What is true beauty? In terms of material, domestically produced clothing material is true beauty. In terms of color, simple and non-fading clothing material is true beauty. In terms of style, elegant and practical clothing material is true beauty. In terms of economy, cheap, durable, and wear-resistant clothing material is true beauty. In general, only by wearing truly beautiful clothing can one receive respect and admiration from others. If one wears foreign labels, foreign silk crepe, or foreign wool, then one has lost true beauty. The English Queen wore Lancashire cotton cloth and was respected by the entire nation, almost to the point of becoming a trend. The whole nation followed suit, considering wearing this kind of clothing the supreme glory of life, much more noble than embroidered dragon and phoenix brocade and luxurious clothing. This is because clothing made of domestic cloth meets the standards of true beauty. Extending this further, Meiya's silk crepe, Zhanghua's wool, and Hongxin's fabrics are all leaders of domestic goods, truly equal in status and with their own true value. However, in recent times, morality has declined, with falsehoods replacing truths, and deceptive tricks emerging endlessly, making it difficult for those who love to wear beautiful clothing to distinguish between them. First, materials that are clearly inferior foreign goods are disguised, causing genuine domestic silk crepe, domestic wool, and domestic fabrics to lose their position in sales. Second, colors should gain the trust of customers by not fading, but currently, fading clothing material is everywhere. This indeed kills the enthusiasm of those who love to use domestic goods. Manager Xu Yangnan of Hongxin Dyeing and Weaving Factory once said, "The morality of clothing lies in not fading." This is very true. Third, in terms of style, it also follows the trend of colors. If there is elegant and non-fading clothing material, making clothing will naturally be fitting and beautiful, and people will naturally flock to it. This is obvious. Fourth, in terms of economy, in this year of domestic goods and the era of everyone enjoying domestic goods, the only obligation of producers is to make small profits and sell more, and to reduce costs. If they take this opportunity to raise prices, they are inviting failure. Even those who love to use domestic goods will retreat three times. Moreover, in terms of products, they should not only be cheap but also durable and wear-resistant, so that the true beauty of clothing can be maintained forever.</p>
<p>Truly beautiful clothing, lovely truly beautiful clothing, I hope manufacturers who pay attention to clothing will satisfy the desire to use domestic goods.</p>

<h3 id="e232">Winter Clothes King <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>(Autumn harvest and winter storage) This old saying refers to the Chinese habit of thousands of years, because all agricultural products are generally harvested abundantly in autumn, and stored in winter, which can be used for a year's use. So in winter, business is very prosperous, and there are especially many folk marriages, so the shops selling clothing fabrics, business is particularly prosperous.</p>
<p>However, in Shanghai, and the ports close to Shanghai, most people generally buy more clothes in summer and autumn, because the clothing fabrics in summer and autumn are relatively cheaper, so they see the clothes fabrics they love, but buy them at any time, make clothes at any time, but did not budget for the cost of winter clothing fabrics, and when winter comes, they have no ability to buy more.</p>
<p>In fact, winter clothing fabrics are extremely needed, and winter clothing, if it should be added but not added, will feel shabby. Now society only values clothing, not human feelings, so the cost of household mourning clothing should have a budget throughout the year, in the summer and autumn rainy season, in addition to the indispensable, must not be too wasteful, must not be willfully added, and for winter clothing, should be added to add, do not hesitate.</p>

<p>Strange Hobbies and Crazy Decorations (Xu)</p>
<p>Clothing Benefits Various</p>
<p>Now we want to discuss the third question ·· the economic impact of fashion.</p>
<p>In the industrial zone, fashion seems to be a stimulant for production ·· but this only applies to the objects needed. Because the predictions for all fashions in each season cannot be easily changed · on the one hand increase, of course, the other hand will decrease · there is also a need for different industries, so in this industry, but in another industry it will change.</p>
<p>The luxury silk weaving industry, because fashion changes particularly quickly, creates many new designs for fabrics, patterns, organizations, colors, etc., to meet the needs of society · so great changes occur every season, especially in this time of world economic panic, ordinary applied fabrics only supply the general need · but novel fabrics can often cause people to buy with excitement and high prices. The statistics clearly indicate ·· that the change in fashion can obtain huge benefits · regardless of large and small industries and household industries, has been able to benefit a lot. Thousands of millions of men and women workers rely on countless looms to earn their daily rice.</p>
<p>In terms of the length of women's clothes, of course, there is a considerable relationship with the prosperity and decline of the textile industry · so when the fashion of short and close-fitting clothes is popular, there is a sense of panic in the sales of output · and sometimes although such a fashion is created, the public opinion of society, there are praises, and there are slanders · a piece of silk material that was originally needed, therefore reduced by half · of course, the production of the industry will be affected a lot.</p>

<h3 id="e236">Studies on Clothing and Environment: Considerations for Color Tone, Style, Age, and Figure <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>The color tone of women's clothing is most closely related to age and figure. As for the material of the clothing, whether it is silk, cloth, or wool, it is all the same. When we go out on the streets of Shanghai, we often see the backs of many women without being able to see their faces. Almost all of them are young women of eighteen or nineteen years of age. However, if the color tones of their clothes are used inappropriately, it can often increase dislike, so it is of great value to study.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the most taboo thing for overweight people in clothing is large patterns. Deep red and bright green are also unsuitable. It is best to choose lighter colors, or small willow-shaped or long-shaped patterns, which can make others seem to perceive a reduction in their weight. This is a kind of illusion in psychology. Short people should also use willow-shaped long patterns.</p>
<p>However, this cannot be generalized. If a woman is over thirty and is short and plump, she should definitely not use delicate colors, but should use neutral colors.</p>
<p>Ordinary people believe that women with fair complexions can make their fair faces appear even whiter by wearing black or dark-colored clothing. However, reality and ideals are often inversely proportional. We only need to pay attention to Western women. Their skin color is very fair. Except for mourning days, winter, or old age, they rarely use dark or black colors, because the matching of color tones must seek neutrality to feel harmonious and comfortable. Savage nations mostly like stimulating color tones. In addition, only prostitutes are like this. In civilized cities, stimulating colors are rarely piled on them. Therefore, the fairer a woman's complexion is, the more suitable she is to use neutral-colored clothing, and the patterns on the clothing should be regular but not very obvious, so as not to feel fiery.</p>
<p>The beauty of clothing can certainly increase a person's beauty, but the women's clothing in Shanghai is too generally prostitute-like, and the prostitutes are also generally good-family-woman-like. This is a very worrying thing. They have completely disregarded their own age, identity, and figure, and single-mindedly want to become or force themselves into being a budding young girl, or even a girl who can captivate the masses, desperately working hard in terms of clothing and makeup. As a result, the result is the opposite. You must know that the beauty of women is certainly the most beautiful around the age of twenty, but around the age of thirty, or even around the age of forty, if the clothing is appropriate, it is enough to show the beauty suitable for her age. If you want to pretend to be seventeen or eighteen years old, it will definitely be like painting a tiger and failing, resembling a dog instead.</p>
<p>Therefore, once past middle age, one should tend towards simplicity, and around the age of twenty, one should also consider one's own skin color and figure to match appropriate clothing. The fashions that have been popular recently are mostly evolved from Western-style clothing. For example, people with thick waists can add a few frills on both sides of the lower waist of the clothes, which can make people hallucinate that her waist is large and not feel that her waist is thick. Also, people with dark upper arms can make dark-colored lantern-style short sleeves, which can also reduce the ugliness of thick, dark arms.</p>
<p>Tall, thin people should not use willow-shaped or long-shaped patterned fabrics. Short, fat people should not use round flower patterns. People with short legs should not use red-like colors. People with a lot of hair should not use black or brown. These are very obvious and easy to know.</p>
<p>Chinese women also have a habit of liking several sisters, or several close acquaintances, to dress completely alike, or seeing others cut a piece of fabric and make a fashionable dress, they will imitate it in the same way, without studying whether it is suitable for them to wear. If they put it on and feel it doesn't look good, but discard it, this is also very related to economic aspects. Therefore, each person has their own suitable clothing, there is no need to imitate others, this is the first essential of studying clothing, blindly following others will definitely not get praise from others, and their own satisfaction.</p>

<h3 id="e237">High-Frequency Amplification in Transmitters <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— Ming Xiang</p>
<p>Modern broadcasting or signal transmitters, in addition to the main oscillation stage, have at least one or more stages of high-frequency amplification. The most important thing in the high-frequency amplification stage is the neutralization device, unless the vacuum tube used is a screen-grid type. The purpose of neutralization is to avoid self-oscillation of the vacuum tube due to the coupling of the internal capacitance of the vacuum tube, which interferes with the frequency stimulated by the oscillation stage and loses its amplification effect, which is the same as the high-frequency stage of a radio.</p>
<p>Vacuum tubes used for high-frequency amplification are usually Class B amplification. Its grid negative potential is extremely high. When there is no excitation, the grid current is actually equal to zero. The reason for using Class B amplification instead of the usual Class A or audio frequency amplification is that the efficiency of Class A amplification is only 15%, while Class B can get 80 to 85%. The diagram shows a simple oscillation amplification transmitter amplification stage circuit. The high-frequency electrical energy output from the oscillation stage is fed to the input circuit of the amplification stage through the coupling capacitor C2 via the feeder lines A and B. Because there is a high-frequency choke RFO connected across, the high-frequency current cannot flow into the C battery circuit, otherwise it will be a loss. To test whether this choke is reliable, simply connect a bypass capacitor C4, as shown by the dotted line. If the screen-grid current does not change when connected, it proves that this choke is perfect and reliable, otherwise, it has failed.</p>
<p>The ammeter and C battery in series in the grid circuit are very valuable indicators. After the oscillation and amplification stages are turned on, this meter will have an index indicating the corresponding value of the excitation voltage, so its function is actually equal to a high-frequency voltage meter, which is very helpful in the neutralization amplification stage. The direct current flowing through this grid current meter is the direct current after the high-frequency voltage is rectified by the grid of the amplification tube. This point must be clearly understood. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e238">Sand Noise in Dynamic Loudspeakers <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Zhi</p>
<p>When a dynamic loudspeaker on an AC machine has sand noise, the tone becomes complex and vague, and unpleasant to the ear. There are approximately three reasons for this annoying sand noise:</p>
<p>(1) Rust on the poles of the electromagnet. There is a huge electromagnet inside the dynamic loudspeaker (if readers want to know the simple principle and structure of the dynamic loudspeaker, please refer to my article (Talking about Loudspeakers), published in this journal on July 8). Due to moisture intrusion and long-term disuse, the poles of this magnet rust, forming a thin layer of iron filings. When the voice coil vibrates, it rubs against it and generates irregular motion, causing sand noise. The repair method is to carefully disassemble the loudspeaker, wipe it clean with fine sandpaper (used to wipe the commutator on the generator), or wipe it clean with cotton dipped in kerosene, and then apply a little oil and wipe it dry with a cloth, so that it is not easy to rust in the future.</p>
<p>(2) Dust and sand accumulate between the electromagnet and the voice coil. The gap between the mother magnetic field electromagnet and the voice coil is approximately one-thousandth to fifteen-thousandths of an inch, so dust and sand accumulate in it. When the voice coil vibrates, it can rub and cause sand noise. This dust and sand is easier to remove. Sometimes, inverting the loudspeaker and waiting for it to vibrate violently a few times will allow the dust and sand to fall out naturally.</p>
<p>(3) Loose screws and other reasons. If the screws on the loudspeaker are loose, the electromagnet may come into contact with the voice coil after vibration. When the voice coil vibrates, sand noise caused by friction occurs. Sometimes, the voice coil may also develop this problem due to poor construction, dampness, or skew. The repair method is to correct the voice coil so that it does not contact the magnet, and place it in a ventilated place to dry it.</p>
<p>In short, a good dynamic loudspeaker will never emit unpleasant sand noise. The occurrence of sand noise must be due to the voice coil coming into contact with the electromagnet or dust and sand during vibration, causing friction. To protect the dynamic loudspeaker from emitting sand noise, it should be placed in a clean and dry place to avoid the trouble of repair.</p>
<h3 id="e239">Remedies for Unstable Voltage <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— Wei Xin Su</p>
<p>Power supply in the mainland often has unstable voltage, especially when the lights are lit up at dusk, and during special festivals, due to insufficient current supply, the voltage drops, which greatly affects the use of AC radios. Conversely, if the current consumption decreases, there is often an excessive voltage, which makes the radio even more dangerous. The remedy is to add a step-down transformer in front of the primary stage of the radio power square shed, as shown in the figure above. This square shed can be filled with an electric bell shed. There is a kind on the market with primary IIOV and secondary 2.5, 3V, 5V, 7, 9V, etc., which is very suitable for needs.</p>
<p>For example, if the voltage in Area A drops by 5V at dusk, then put S on the 5V terminal. In this way, the output voltage of the secondary stage of the step-down square shed is 5V. Because it is connected in series with the input circuit of the radio power square shed, according to the principle of (if the positive terminal of Voltage A is connected in series with the negative terminal of Voltage B, then the total voltage equals Voltage A plus Voltage B), it can compensate for the drop of 5V. If there is excessive voltage, a double-pole double-throw switch can be used to invert the primary stage terminal of the small square shed to change the electrode of its secondary output, and use the neutralization principle to cancel the small square shed output voltage with the radio power square shed input voltage, then (the total voltage equals Voltage A minus Voltage B).</p>
<h3 id="e240">Directionality of Large Antennas (Continued) <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— Jin</p>
<p>The above is the situation when viewed from above, that is, when the antenna transmits and receives in all directions of the horizon. Now, if you observe in the direction of the horizon, and see the situation of the antenna transmitting and receiving in the vertical direction, it is different again. The situation of the simplest vertical antenna can be seen in the second figure. From that curve, we can know that the direction with the greatest transmitting and receiving ability is in the horizontal direction, that is, the direction with zero degrees with the horizontal. The larger the angle with the horizontal, the weaker the transmitting and receiving ability. For example, the ability to 25 degrees, represented by Gb, is only half of Ga at 0 degrees. The larger the angle, the smaller the transmitting and receiving ability, and after 50, it is almost gone. Therefore, this type of antenna cannot communicate with airplanes. However, if you use the inverted L type, the lead-in wire of that antenna is equivalent to a vertical antenna. Now that the flat top part has the maximum transmitting and receiving ability only in the direction of the sky and the earth. Except for the refraction effect, it has almost no transmitting and receiving ability on the horizontal aspect, so at this time, the vertical lead-in wire is just responsible for transmitting and receiving on the horizontal ground. Therefore, this type of antenna has great transmitting and receiving ability in both the horizontal and vertical directions. The other TV types are the same.</p>
<p>The directionality mentioned above can be very useful. The figure below is the most convenient way to use it. This is the best device when both transmitting and receiving antennas use the inverted L type. That is to say, the two are in the same plane, and the grounded ends are installed close to each other head to head. When the ordinary radio is receiving, pointing the inverted L antenna at the transmitting station, and connecting the grounded end in the direction of the transmitting station, will make the receiving result like a point, which is why. However, it should be noted that if you use a very short antenna, this kind of directionality is not very obvious. If the flat top part is longer and installed lower, this kind of directionality is more obvious. (End)</p>

<p>Using a voltmeter in series with a battery to test whether various radio parts are damaged is the simplest and most accurate method. However, the sensitivity of the voltmeter used for this test must be as high as possible, otherwise it will feel impractical when testing.</p>
<p>The price of a voltmeter with reliable sensitivity is very expensive. It is inevitable for ordinary radio enthusiasts to feel quite difficult to purchase one. This article specifically introduces a tester ammeter with a simple structure for readers to use. As shown in the figure, first wind 1,000 to 2,000 turns of No. 36 enameled wire on a coil frame made of thick cardboard (the more turns, the more sensitive the effect). After winding, use copper sheet to fix the coil on the wooden board. (In the figure, a corner of the copper sheet is missing to show the winding method of the coil.) Then embed an ordinary military-use pocket compass in one end of the coil frame, and clamp the other end with copper sheet. The battery in series can be placed on the table or hidden under the board. Then move the wooden board, wait until the compass is at a right angle to the coil (as shown in the figure), and then you can use it.</p>
<p>For example, if you want to test a transformer, you only need to connect the wire ends to the two stacks of A and B in turn, and see if the compass moves to find out where the broken wire or short circuit is.</p>
<p>Although the above-mentioned tester ammeter has a very simple structure, its effect is exceptionally sensitive. When half a milliampere passes through the coil, the pointer can jump. This point is beyond the reach of any other cheap voltmeter. (Note: Even the smallest screw in this voltmeter must not use magnetized materials such as steel and iron, otherwise the magnetic needle will lose its effect.)</p>

<p>— Wei Yan</p>
<p>The Current Situation of Domestic Broadcasting</p>
<p>Among all the broadcasting stations in China, the Nanjing Central Broadcasting Station is the largest in terms of power. In terms of quantity, Shanghai is the most. Now, let’s briefly describe the broadcasting programs of these two stations. The broadcasting stations in other places will be discussed later.</p>
<p>Nanjing</p>
<p>Before the Nanjing Central Broadcasting Station (XGOA) was renovated with large machines, the programs were not as rich as they are now. Except for lectures, news, records, and at most once a week special programs (national opera, Kunqu opera, etc.), there is nothing else worth mentioning. When the station tested a 75,000-watt transmitter last summer, the author sent a letter requesting to add the following types of programs:</p>
<p>(1) Increase various academic programs (teaching Chinese, etc.) to educationalize the broadcasting industry.</p>
<p>(2) Add programs on radio knowledge and Q&amp;A to instill radio knowledge to the general public and solve the difficulties encountered by listeners during experimentation.</p>
<p>(3) Add more entertainment programs to arouse public interest in radio.</p>
<p>After the station officially opened on the birthday of the Premier last year, it made major adjustments to the programs. In addition to the above-mentioned points, which have been added one after another, it has also added code practice, commercial intelligence reports, and national martial arts morning exercises programs, which were temporarily full of pleasant sounds.</p>
<p>The efforts of the Central Broadcasting Station to collect programs are indeed higher than the hopes of ordinary people. The past facts can prove that:</p>
<p>(1) Experts were specially invited to compile several volumes of drum lyrics, such as Sun Yat-sen's London escape, Qiu Jin's martyrdom, and signing a false contract to sell out, etc., and invited drum masters He Zhichen, Jin Yufang, etc. to take turns to play and sing on the stage, which was very popular among the audience.</p>
<p>(2) Schools, groups, and amateur opera troupes in Beijing have been played by the station almost all over. Famous actors such as Cheng Yanqiu, Xin Yanqiu, and Xu Biyun have all broadcasted on the station successively. When it opened last winter, Mei Lanfang was invited to participate, although it could not be realized due to the matter, but the station's concern for collecting programs can be seen.</p>
<h3 id="e243">Small Experience Soldering Method of Earphone Lead Wire <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>— Li Yuanqing</p>
<p>The lead wire of ordinary earphones or speakers is most likely to be detached from the copper feet (Tip) after long-term use. Sometimes, even if it is not detached, the inside has already loosened. Therefore, it is inconvenient to use or it is often easy to cause noise. The only way to remedy it is to disassemble it and solder it again.</p>
<p>We know that it is most difficult to solder lead wires whose outer surface is plated with metal (see issue 21 of this journal). Sometimes the solder has not melted, but the wire has already been charred, especially inside the copper feet, which makes you sigh that your arms are too short to reach!</p>
<p>The method introduced in this article can relieve you of this difficulty. First, use a knife to cut off the insulation on the outside of the wire (about one inch), and then wrap a thin copper wire tightly around the lead wire. Then stuff a little solder into the copper feet (the inside of the copper feet should be cleaned first). Finally, clamp the copper feet with pliers and put them on a spirit lamp to burn. After the solder inside is completely dissolved, insert the lead wire with a knife, and it will be as strong as before after standing cold for one minute. (Note: The lead wire and the inside of the copper feet must be pre-coated with solder flux before soldering.)</p>

<p>It can be made with two nails, a small piece of wood or hard thick paper, and a section of useless thick copper wire. It seems worthless, but its use is very great, such as for protecting filaments, illuminating dials, and testing circuits. The manufacturing method is as shown in the figure. Wrap a section of about No. 14 thick bare copper wire around a penholder for four or five turns, and nail one end to the paper with a long nail. Nail another nail in the center under the circle. Calculate the distance between the two nails so that they can be inserted into the vacuum tube socket to test whether the voltage of the filament is accurate.</p>

<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>People often say (view of life), thinking that there is a (meaning) as a guise. But I don’t know that after talking about it, there is still no meaning, because since a person has been made, in this kind of net and shackles, it is like being in the realm of five turbidities, how can he jump out of the Asura’s field, and everyone goes to climb the Avatamsaka dream (Golden World) (Pure Land)? You! If you don’t believe it, try to look at Peter the Great, who was famous in history, although he is dead and buried in the imperial mausoleum, hey! After a hundred years, his silver coffin will turn over, and all the funeral treasures will be unearthed and sold by the living, isn’t it a significant cause and effect that no matter how heroic he was in his life, he is still unreliable after death? Such things have become commonplace recently, even the Qing Mausoleum in our country has been excavated several times, so the four words (final judgment after coffin is closed) are really illogical and confusing nouns when said now, we should correct it, why is it because it is always felt to be incorrect in the (view of death) philosophy!</p>
<p>Let’s not talk about the remote examples, let’s take the present as an example. Chen Jiongming of Guangdong is dead, and his (rights and wrongs, merits and demerits) will be recorded in the future history, so we don’t need to criticize him. However, he died, and he ended up with a reputation of desolation and no possessions outside of himself. Old Wu said, (What he can enter the ground with a smile is that the current opinion thinks that he cannot rest his eyes, how can he expect to be as qualified as (Sheng Xuanhuai)’s grand funeral, and (Ni Sichong) (Feng Guozhang)’s death after having property lawsuits? Old Wu’s words can really awaken the delusions of many people, especially in (views on death), and under the definition, if it is not the case, it is (making children and grandchildren as opium addicts, as playboys), alas! I don’t know that the world is like cattle and horses who have been sons and grandsons before they were born, seeking fields and houses, and busy for a lifetime, but they have not enjoyed any happiness. When the moment of death comes, breathing stops, and hearing and vision also stop, those who talk long and short will have to estimate how much property he left behind. In fact, except for his children, no one else can share anything, and it has become a custom. A few days ago, Wu Yiqing in our county) died in Shanghai, and someone said that he (had no savings after his death and felt pity), I heard that this old man used to be a minister to Italy and was also an official, but he had no money after his death, which is his noble character, not insulting the people of our county. If you misunderstand this point, you have not died thoroughly to the essence of (views on death)!</p>
<h3 id="e246">National Product Champagne <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>Auspicious words of praise and blessing are so pleasing to the ear. On the first day of the New Year, people shout "Congratulations and may you be prosperous!" When seeing someone off, they say "Smooth sailing!" To congratulate newlyweds, "May your home be harmonious and prosperous with many children and grandchildren!" To wish someone a birthday, "May your fortune be as vast as the East Sea and your life as long as the Southern Mountain!" And new stores also paste up couplets saying, "May business flourish to the four seas, and wealth abound to the three rivers." Those building houses also stick red paper saying, "The erection of the pillar auspiciously coincides with the fortunate day, and the raising of the beam happily meets the auspicious star." Every undertaking must begin with good fortune. Even the most civilized Westerners find it hard to break away from this kind of superstition. The launching of a ship and the naming of an airplane must involve a delicate beauty holding a bottle of champagne, throwing it with her slender hand, the wine spraying everywhere, and the crowd cheering, wishing it future victory and good luck. In the past, foreigners played this game, but now it has spread to our noble country. If you don't believe me, look at how nowadays when ships are launched and planes are named, it's always some Mrs. So-and-so or socialite throwing champagne, but never the old practice of burning incense and praying. This is progress in our etiquette!</p>
<p>Speaking of champagne, authentic champagne is of course French, costing several dollars a bottle. With a loud bang, it is thrown at the bow of the ship or the nose of the plane, with not even half a drop reaching the mouth. How could Li Bai not complain, and Ruan Ji roll his eyes, repeatedly saying, "What a sin! What a sin! What a pity! What a pity!" Recently, at the naming ceremony of the Hangzhou airplane, newspapers reported that everything else was the same, except that Shaoxing wine was used instead of champagne, which was quite novel. Some people said that Shaoxing wine is a domestic product, which promotes national goods. Some people said that Shaoxing wine is only a few cents a bottle, which promotes thrift. I don't agree with either of these points. As for promoting national goods, the airplane itself is from abroad, so why bother about a bottle of foreign wine? As for promoting thrift, such a large sum of money has already been given to foreigners, so why fuss about the price of a bottle of wine?</p>
<p>There was a follower of the altar who was truly filial. He thought that Buddhist teachings were boundless, and because he deeply missed his deceased mother, he prayed to the altar spirit to allow him to see the face of his departed mother. After a while, the altar spirit descended, instructing him to wait for an opportunity, and he would receive an edict in response during the next descent.</p>
<p>The disciples and believers below the altar were stirred by these words, and everyone hoped to catch a glimpse of their deceased relatives. They all knelt before the altar spirit and made the same request, but the altar spirit gave them a clever answer, saying that it would be discussed at the next descent.</p>
<p>The next altar date arrived. A T-shaped wooden stylus was held by two people, jumping east and west, drawing chaotic characters in the sand on the plate. The altar spirit descended, announcing to the crowd, "Only two people have the opportunity to see the faces of their own relatives." It instructed them to go to a certain mountain in Hangzhou on a certain night and photograph the space. Many miracles would surely be discovered.</p>
<p>They followed the instructions of the altar spirit. After the photos were developed, images of figures in ancient attire appeared, resembling the faces of the individuals when they were alive. This further strengthened their faith, and they quickly spread this spiritual phenomenon among themselves.</p>
<p>Friends, have you received the baptism of science? Do you believe that these miracles are not tricks to deceive fools? Friends, do not hesitate, and give us a clear judgment!</p>
<p>The thing is a foreign product, the ceremony is Western, and it's mixed with some local wine. What does that amount to? In the past, Zigong wanted to get rid of the sacrificial sheep, but Confucius was furious, pointing his finger and scolding, "You are a petty miser! You're being stingy with a sheep, but I want to maintain the ritual!" This time, the people of Hangzhou used Shaoxing wine. If Confucius were alive today, he definitely wouldn't approve.</p>
<p>I have come up with a good idea: the name of champagne should not be abolished. Speculating liquor companies can invent a type of national product champagne specifically for throwing bottles. It can be filled with cold water or Shaoxing wine, since it's going to be thrown away anyway.</p>
<p>If one day China builds its own airplanes and warships, and then uses Shaoxing wine for the bottle-throwing ceremony, using entirely domestic products, then I would have no choice but to approve.</p>

<p>The night is very quiet. At this time, everyone should be chasing good dreams in their sleep. But in a certain place, there are still bright lights shining and candles glowing. A group of silent people stand on both sides of the shrine, and incense smoke forms circles, swirling around the room. The sand in the plate is being raked like silkworms eating mulberry leaves. It is said that this solemn scene is</p>

<p>— Yu Youqing</p>
<p>Our China really has a relationship with water and fire. During the restoration in the Xinhai year, there was once a flood. At that time, you were still a primary school student, eating at a square table, I still remember. The year before last, there was another big flood, and at the same time, the Northeast was filled with gunfire, the heartbreaking September 18th Incident. During the Battle of Shanghai, Zhabei once again became a place of bombardment. This year, there is the Yellow River breach flood. From atop Kaifeng city, one can see the water scenery. On the Bund and Nanjing Road in Shanghai, one can travel by small gasoline boat. Besides these things, further back in time, there were the Zhili-Fengtian Wars and the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Wars, which bestowed upon the people no small amount of gunfire. Not long after, the two Lius in Sichuan fought fiercely, giving the people a taste of fire. The very secret and semi-public troops of Liu Zhennian set fires wildly in a certain county of Zhejiang, also giving the people a taste of fire, because they had never seen gunfire, so they switched to setting fires. In the summer, Shanghai shows off its water skills in the swimming pools. When it gets cold, they squat by the stove, not wanting to leave for a moment. Young people love to smoke opium, bowing to the fire, and when they are idle, they snatch snake-like women and jump around wildly like sailors. Alas, broken China, unable to escape the fate of water and fire, we are in deep water and scorching fire. Do we not want to leave it? Roar! People of China, stop being water ghosts and fire monsters.</p>

<p>Zhao Ziqiang collapsed onto the bed, his legs spread apart. At the same time, he clapped his hands and threw them outwards, sighing, "How are we supposed to do this? The company is only borrowing thirty dollars for the departure." Guan Yaowu laughed, "You're taking things too seriously, that's why you can't find a solution. Actually, we don't need to worry so much. Just treat it as if we're still stationed in Xiyuan and haven't left yet. That way, we won't need to spend any money." Zhao Ziqiang said, "Unlike you, you have a family. Don't you need to prepare some settlement money?" Guan Yaowu said, "If you think like that, there's no end to it. If we get to a place with postal services and get paid, I'll send money home to them. If we get to a place without postal services, they'll just have to accept their fate and endure it. Anyway, not many people will starve to death in this world." Zhao Ziqiang forced a smile, "If you think like that, then indeed, there's nothing that can't be solved. But I can't think like that. I only have a sixty-year-old father left at home. How can I let him endure it?" Guan Yaowu shook his head with a smile, "It's not just for that, is it? You also have someone special in your heart, don't you?" Zhao Ziqiang sighed, "Hey! Don't mention it." He clasped the ten fingers of his two hands tightly together, lowered his head, almost touching his chest. The depression and oppression in his heart that he couldn't express were even more severe than Guan Yaowu's. In the room, one person sat on the bed, and the other stood leaning against a small table. Both of them were silent. After a long time, Guan Yaowu suddenly raised his head and said, "Old brother, don't think about it. Once it's over, it's over. We just leave and don't care if the sky falls. Then it's no problem. Let's go back to the company and take care of things. Don't overthink it." As he spoke, he walked over and lightly patted Zhao Ziqiang on the shoulder a few times. He had been silent for a long time. Finally, he straightened up suddenly, stood up, and said, "Okay, I trust you." As he spoke, he sighed again before turning back to the company headquarters. As he went downstairs from here, he passed under Yin Deren's room and heard a faint sound of opera singing coming from the window, "Brother Yue, he treats me like a brother. I, Wang Zuo, have no merit, how can I accept such glory? Tonight, I will use a clever plan to break into the barbarian camp..." (218)</p>

<p>American Farmers Demand Higher Prices for Agricultural Products, Harrison Proposes Purchasing Silver to Issue Silver Coins</p>
<p>The gold market gradually weakened yesterday, and the market outlook fell further. In the morning, overseas silver markets in both England and America fell, and silver prices on the Far East Gold Exchange contracted by two and a half to three and a half points. Although exchange rates opened lower, they rebounded sharply at closing. London spot gold fell two shillings and one and a half pence. American new mine gold price was $29.18, a decrease of $1.15 compared to the previous day. Stocks fell $4.57. American cotton fell slightly, while American wheat rose 1.125 points. Wool trading opened flat and weak. After the opening, the situation was still weak, but the HSBC exchange rate remained unchanged, and was once stable. Due to people's uncertain moods and uncertain situations, Reuters reported that French Finance Minister Poullain today declared that rumors of France abolishing the gold standard were completely untrue. Traders were bullish on the exchange rate, and the gold market declined. The midday close was slightly flat. In the afternoon, Reuters reported that American farmers will hold a general strike on Saturday to demand higher prices for agricultural products. In addition, American Senator Harrison proposed an expansion plan, saying that the most effective way for any country, whether American, English, French, or Chinese, is to purchase silver on the market to issue silver coins. Gold prices were already weak, and this fueled selling. The $20 level was broken, and prices plummeted. The naked price was $1,120. The day's market situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The morning opening was $826, slightly lower than the previous close of $1.50. Goods opened at $6.50. The exchange rate opened with the near-term selling price of British exchange at one shilling three pence and twelve-five, and American exchange at $28.8125. January American gold was difficult to sell at $25, and under the supply of Hengyu Yuan Sheng Yong Fu Chang, it retreated to $4.20. Zhejiang bought January American gold at $3.125. Chartered Bank bought February at 50 cents and gradually stabilized. It was heard that HSBC's exchange rate had not changed. The Central Exchange Bureau wanted to buy December American gold at $1.25 but failed, and then it rose to $7.50. Yuan Mao Da De Cheng Bing Xing took advantage of the high price and sold, retreating to $4.50. Zhifeng Yong then entered and gradually improved to $2. The situation on the market was uncertain, and people were extremely flustered. Goods from Da De Cheng Fu Chang Yuan Heng Yuan Mao Yong and others all sold, falling to $3.50. Bank of China bought February at 50 cents and remained stable. But Bing Xing Shun Li Chang Sheng Yong Yuan Sheng Yong Zhifeng Yong and others continued to sell. Shanghai came out with January American gold at $3.75, falling to $2.20. Zhaofeng Chang Yuan Chun Hengyu Qing Fa Yong and others bought at the low. Bank of China bought January American gold at $4.375, rebounding to $2. Suddenly, the French officially announced the maintenance of the gold standard, and everyone thought that the exchange rate could not fall any further. Hengyu Da De Cheng Fu Chang Zhifeng Yong Qian Chang Xiang jointly sold when it fell to $20.08. Bank of China once bought December American gold at $1.875. Yuan Mao Yong Hengyu Yuan Chun took the opportunity to buy, and the situation improved again. Zhaofeng Chang also entered, rising to over $4. The midday close was $823.70, and goods were sold at $4.</p>
<p>The afternoon opening was $824.30, and goods opened at $4.50. Yongfeng entered at $5.20. Yuan Mao Yong repeatedly supplied strips. Shun Mao Rui Xing Qian Chang Xiang Heng Xing Yuan Zhaofeng Chang and others jointly sold, Zhongfu stopped January at 50 cents and fell to $19.20. Yuan Mao Yong Tian Feng Yong Tong Tai Chang paid strips, and it was slightly stable. The news was unfavorable, and the exchange rate hardened. Mei Feng then stopped February American gold at 75 cents, Da De Cheng Shun Li Qian Chang Xiang Hong Li Zhifeng Yong and others sold fiercely, falling to $16. Citibank bought February American gold at $8.125, Zhaofeng Chang Hui Xiang Bing Xing entered at $7.60, Bank of China stopped January American gold at 62.5 cents. Shun Li Hong Li sold again, falling to $4.10, Citibank bought January American gold at $6.875, Yuan Mao Yong Yi Da Yong entered at $6.20, but people's spirits were not high, and the domestic market gradually hardened, Zheng Chang Heng Chang Yong Fu Yu sold to $2.80, Yuan Mao Yong Hengyu Yuan Chun Qian Chang Xiang paid strips. The closing price was $814, and after closing, goods from Da De Cheng Yuan Kang Xiang and others sold to $2. Yuan Mao Yong Bing Xing and others from the Dalian gang took the opportunity to buy at the low, and finally it was still around $3.50. Goods were sold early at $3.50. It was found that the highest during the day was $827.50, and the lowest was $812.80, a difference of $14.70. As a result, it fell $13.50 compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>Because HSBC's American exchange rate did not move, it was still $28.375, the combined gold price was over $845. According to the closing price, it was approximately $31, which was more than the previous close. The registered price for the previous market was $840 for this month, $832 for November, and $824 for December. The morning replenishment was $840. The afternoon market was $830 for this month, $822 for November, and $814 for December. The afternoon replenishment was $830. The naked price was $1,120.

However, the price of foreign exchange in the market remained unchanged, both morning and afternoon being 6 points, the same as the previous days. The initial market was non-existent.

<p>Yesterday was one of the long-term expiration dates. All loans issued and deposits accepted by banks in the previous round (April 20th) had to be settled on that day. Therefore, there were many transactions. According to the banks, the result of the loan collateral situation was that over two million were settled, over one million four hundred thousand were transferred, and over four million were newly made. These loans were purely rollovers, so those needing to be rolled over for six months had interest rates ranging from seven to eight yuan. Furthermore, the amount of long-term loans made by money shops was over five million for transferred loans and over one million two hundred thousand for new loans. Over one million loans were moved between accounts, and over three million were transferred. The total amount of loans settled on that day reached over eighteen or nineteen million. In addition, Ningbo banks also made over forty or fifty thousand in loans yesterday and transferred over two million, all of which expire on the 25th, so they are not included in yesterday's total amount. As for interest rates, they ranged from eight yuan two and a half jiao to ten yuan zero five jiao. In addition, pawnshops, silk shops, and various businesses on the main street all had considerable transactions, but the amounts are too numerous to detail.</p>

<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, the market initially remained chaotic and fluctuating, but then showed some strength. The overall situation did not escape fluctuation, as the environment was dull and the market was not stimulated. Both buyers and sellers were carefully observing and waiting for the right time to act. Trading was not active, so prices naturally tended to be stable. Currently, the future rise and fall depend on the strength of both sides. As settlement approaches, it is like a close-quarters battle, and the strength of both sides will be revealed. There should be significant movement within the day. The two morning sessions yesterday were extremely chaotic, with very little buying and selling. Prices were also inconsistent. The results of the two sessions were generally slightly weak. Only trade number 33 sold 20 rolls, and number 21 bought in a relatively large amount. The afternoon session opened with some buying in number 4, but few sellers, showing a slight rebound of five fen to two jiao or more. The closing was stable, with 19 Customs Bonds showing the largest increase of two jiao. The price results were mixed, mostly only five fen or one jiao, with only whole number six and 19 Customs Bonds rising by two jiao to two and a half jiao at most. The total transaction volume was 4,855,000 yuan. Spot goods were still not traded. The total futures volume, including salt tax, was 1,865,000 yuan, demobilization bonds were 445,000 yuan, 19 Customs Bonds were 610,000 yuan, 20 rolls and 20 Customs Bonds were 1,095,000 yuan, and the rest were between one or two thousand to ten thousand yuan.</p>

<p>According to a report from the Sino-French Trading Company, the New York stock market experienced another sharp decline on the 19th. This was because bulls in various places were competing to liquidate their positions, coupled with uncertain foreign exchange rates and weak commodity prices. Liquor stocks were relatively stable due to the government's ban on foreign liquor imports. Gold mining stocks were weaker due to the strong US dollar and low gold prices, as well as the recent return of American capital from Europe. Good news is urgently needed to reverse this trend. The total trading volume for the day was 2,900,000 shares. (Wheat) The government bought spot and forward wheat. Because the stock market was weak, there were more sales. The spot situation is still firm, and prices at this low level are quite favorable to buyers. (Cotton) It is reported that the foundation for expanding cotton storage in the South is quite stable, and there are few sales, but buyers cannot follow the forward prices. The government has unsatisfactory news about the current situation, and further improvement measures may be possible. (Silver) The market closed quite weak, and speculators are quietly awaiting the development of the dollar exchange rate. The US Treasury Department's gold price is $29.19 per ounce. The Dow Jones Index is listed below:</p>

<p>The yarn market is dull and uninspiring, with no clear gains or losses. Transactions in the market are generally weak. Since a certain association restricted the price of yarn for bidding, speculators have no intention of operating. As a result, there are many short positions being made. As for forward trading volumes, they are also being settled, so the market has entered a period of fluctuation. However, the overall environment is still poor, and a major change is inevitable in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e266">Man-Marked Bidding Listless <a href="#e266" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c266" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">266</a></h3>
<p>The man-marked bidding market opened well in the morning, but lacked buyers. Prices rose one, two, and three jiao in each month. In the afternoon, there was news of bull liquidation, and spot yarn trading was flat. Prices fell three, four, five, and six jiao in each month. The total transaction volume for the day was 13,100 bales. It was found that Tongfu sold 600 bales, Huachang 950 bales, Changfeng 750 bales, Xincheng 500 bales, Zhenda 450 bales, Senkang 400 bales, and Renfeng 400 bales.

<p>The cotton market weakened because the goods shipped in for the October marked cotton bidding were withdrawn due to moisture content. Those holding the goods requested that the association open an investigation and inspection, with the possibility of shipping them in. There was no enthusiasm on the receiving side, so confidence weakened and the market slightly loosened. However, the transaction volume was still huge. The trading period for this month ends on the 26th, but changes are still unpredictable.</p>
<h3 id="e269">Zheng-Marked Fell 3.5 Jiao <a href="#e269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>The Zheng-marked market opened with a slightly looser tone due to unfavorable news for bulls in the current month. Prices fell by one and a half to two and a half jiao in each month. The afternoon remained bearish, with prices falling by one to two jiao in each month. The total transaction volume for the day was 53,000 dan. Yuchang sold 3,200 dan, Tongfu 1,700 dan, Changfeng 2,100 dan, Xincheng 800 dan, and Rongxing 1,000 dan.

<p>Yesterday's American cotton market fluctuated and was uncertain. It rose due to buying by peers and fell due to weakness on Wall Street. As a result, spot prices remained unchanged, while futures fell by one to five points per pound. Liverpool cotton spot prices remained unchanged, while futures rose or fell by one to two points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by one point. The Bombay cotton market initially rose due to buying by speculators, but then weakened due to bull liquidation. The closing was stable. As a result, Pingal rose by 7.5 jiao, and Omla Bai Luoxi rose by 1 rupee 2.5 jiao. The original telegram is recorded below (telegram of the 19th):</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) The source is over 40 firms, and the kiln market has unique characteristics. This is because inland rough grain prices are rising daily, making it difficult to agree on transportation costs, and the arrival of goods is limited. In addition, the Beiyang gang is competing for purchases, so sellers raised prices by more than two chi. The Xinlu sharp Fujian gang also purchased over 600 bales. However, due to the large arrival of goods, the situation is tight. Yangjian is still flat. As for other varieties such as Baige, white rice, and red rice, the new ones vary in their destinations. Although the various gangs are also purchasing broken japonica rice, their willingness is weak, making it difficult to reverse the declining situation. Therefore, prices have fallen by another one or two jiao. The arrival and sales of new Yinyuan are similar, and the market is neither prosperous nor declining.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Over 40 firms arrived with goods. Sales in the market are slightly better. In addition to small increases in the prices of broken japonica rice, white yuan, yangjian, and bujian, the prices of new japonica and Dujian have fallen by one or two jiao. Kiln species of Baige rice have a small price difference. The prices of Chen Bo rice, Yinyuan, and Kejian are stable.</p>
<h3 id="e273">Marked Flour Wheat Enters a Period of Fluctuation <a href="#e273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, each month showed an initial weakening and then stabilizing. According to the quoted price of foreign wheat, Chicago was close to good at four jiao, and far down three jiao. Canada also fell by two jiao outside. Therefore, the opening price generally went down half a fen for each month. Then, as the factories stopped dumping goods, there was a slight replenishment of temporary floating vacancies, and the market atmosphere turned concealed. When the afternoon opened, it was still stable at first, but the transactions in each session turned cold. Because the factories did not dump, and off-site bulls rarely intervened, it was extremely deserted, and the market also entered a flat fall. According to the current market situation, it may temporarily fluctuate. If there is no competition for the sale of foreign wheat, there will be little activity. This situation can be temporarily avoided. As a result, the current month remained unchanged, November was good at two and a half li, February was good at one fen, and February was good at five li, and there was no other change, it is said.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat market in the morning, each month generally showed a flat and quiet state. According to the quoted price of foreign wheat, there were slight changes. Therefore, the market in each month was generally flat. However, transactions were very rare, so the ups and downs were not large. Each share had a drop of one or two fen. When the afternoon opened, the flour market recovered, and although transactions were quiet, the opening price was slightly better. Observing the future prospects, I am afraid that it will enter a period of fluctuation. As a result, only November was small at one fen, and there were no changes in the others. There are no factories willing to accept spot goods, and there is no trading, it is said.</p>

<p>Yesterday, passenger xian rice continued to fall by a small fraction. Because the Fuzhou gang lacked ship positions, the entire gang stopped operating yesterday, and the market was very soft. Later, because the Quanzhou gang still had loading operations, and the inland gang resumed inquiry, the market situation turned from weak to stable, but it was still five or six fen lower than the previous market. Recently, the issue of Japanese rice, which has been rumored in the market, is actually small-grain foreign rice returned by Japanese merchants, not a Japanese product. A total of 50,000 bags were ordered, and 25,000 bags have arrived. The original price was 6 yuan 3 jiao. The Rice Industry Association has now decided that the arrived rice will be temporarily stored and not sold, and the unarrived rice will be returned, so this matter has been resolved. Yesterday, passenger xian rice transactions totaled 640 bags of Hunan Jijing rice sold, priced at 7 yuan 5 jiao 7 fen, as well as 1,000 bags of brown rice, priced at 6 yuan 03 fen, 686 bags of grain rice, priced at 6 yuan 5 jiao 2 fen, 500 bags of Nanjing Chexian rice, priced at 6 yuan 7 jiao, 200 bags of factory xian rice, priced at 7 yuan, and 320 bags of Wuxi machine xian rice, priced at 7 yuan 4 jiao. Among them, Pojing was handled by the inland, and the rest was handled by Quanzhou, it is said.</p>

<p>Yesterday, one carload of large-grain Zhengyangguan soybeans was sold at a price of 4 yuan 3 jiao. Three or four carloads of medium-grain soybeans were sold at prices of 4 yuan 2 jiao 5 fen to 2 jiao. Four carloads of Bengbu Huaiyuan soybeans were sold at prices of 4 yuan 1 jiao to 3 yuan 9 jiao 5 fen. Four or five hundred bags of Jiangbei Pizhou Gaogeng soybeans were sold at prices of 4 yuan 1 jiao 7 fen to 1 jiao 2 fen. Due to a shortage of vehicles from the source, prices turned up four or five fen. Exports are the most active destination. Factories in this street are also taking over, but the trend is not urgent, so prices have not been raised sharply. Due to the low price of the oil market, there is no hope for any substantial increase in the market. Jiujiang Late Soybeans are scarce in origin, and only a few hundred bags are in stock, all of which are substandard, but the selling price feels firm.</p>

<p>Silk factories in Shanghai are shutting down one after another. There are a total of 113 single and double palace silk factories in the city. After the new cocoons were launched this spring, the foreign silk market became smooth, and 64 silk factories successively started operations. However, from summer to autumn, overseas silk prices have been declining, and silk sales have plummeted, causing the factories to be unable to support themselves and to shut down one after another. In the recent month, 44 factories have successively shut down. Now, only 20 factories are barely working to maintain the status quo.</p>
<p>Hangzhou and Shaoxing cocoon clothes are not transported smoothly to Shanghai. Recently, silk cocoon scraps and European sales have also been sluggish. The source is sparse. Since the autumn, a total of only 104 pieces of Hangzhou and Shaoxing cocoon clothes have been transported.</p>
<p>The overseas silk market is still sluggish. After Germany withdrew from the arms reduction conference, European and American silk weavers dared not risk buying and selling futures and current silks. The overseas silk market is still sluggish, and European silk sales are unlikely to turn around.

However, the Yihua Foreign Company purchased 1,054 boxes of black tea produced by local villages and factories in the two lakes yesterday, preparing to ship them to the UK for sale. The selling price was 30, 4 yuan 5 jiao to 49 yuan. Compared with the current Indian and Ceylon tea prices, it is quite suitable, it is said.</p>

<h3 id="e282">Good Phenomenon <a href="#e282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Tao</p>
<p>Because the National Games had athletes from the three northeastern provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang participating, some gentlemen felt relieved and considered it a good phenomenon.</p>
<p>In the past two years, quite a few so-called good phenomena have been discovered. The deeper the national crisis, the more good phenomena there seem to be. Shanghai has concessions, where living is like being in paradise (if you have money). National crises never come here, but good phenomena do exist.</p>
<p>Let's start from the beginning. Around the time the national crisis began, the Chinese in the concessions were quite enthusiastic for a while. They would run up to the top of tall buildings and shout towards the northeast, "Kill! Kill! Kill!" This was saving the country, a good phenomenon. Shops would put up signs saying, "This shop vows not to buy or sell enemy goods." Magazines and publications would publish articles about Japan. Students would lie down on train tracks with their lovers. There would be meetings and telegrams demanding military action. It was all very lively. It was all for saving the country, so who would dare say it wasn't a good phenomenon!</p>
<p>Once the fighting started in Zhabei, even people with scars on their bodies became patriotic fanatics. These were supposedly marks from being wounded by bullets, from fighting hand-to-hand with the Japanese soldiers, so that was also a good phenomenon. If someone was jilted in a love triangle, or too poor to live on, and they checked into a hotel to commit suicide, their suicide note would say, "Indignant at the unending foreign aggression, I commit suicide to repay the country." That was also a good phenomenon. Two years passed by in these good phenomena. Nowadays, you don't see as many articles about Japan in magazines and publications. The signs on shop doors have long been torn down, replaced by banners saying, "National goods sale!" The male and female students lying on the tracks had wedding banquets, and then quickly drafted divorce statements. The only meetings being held these days, besides the National Games, are probably fashion shows and other such grand events. What happened to everything? They say it's "saving the country, putting words into action after the shouting, good phenomena following good phenomena."</p>
<p>But scars are still scars, and suicides are no longer attributed to "repaying the country."</p>
<p>I don't want to mention the past, and I can temporarily not mention what's about to pass. If the creators of good phenomena are young, then they should still have a future.</p>
<h3 id="e283">On the Literary Anthology <a href="#e283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Zizhan</p>
<p>Can the *Wen Xuan* anthology be recommended to modern youth as a must-read? If you ask the Sage of Poetry, he would say, "Become skilled and understand the principles of the *Wen Xuan*!" Unfortunately, there are no such sages of poetry to instruct our youth today. If you ask a literary giant, he would say, "If you've memorized the *Wen Xuan*, you're halfway to becoming a scholar." Unfortunately, there are no such literary giants serving as examiners to test our youth with such texts today. Has Heaven abandoned literature? Are the later generations not allowed to participate in it? We don't need to shake our heads or sigh. To cherish the "foundation of youth's literary cultivation," someone will naturally step forward and loudly proclaim the recommendation of this book to modern youth. There is no doubt about it. To read paralleled prose, you must read the *Wen Xuan*; to read prose, you must read *Zhuangzi*. Even without experienced elders, there are still exemplars. These two books are indeed exemplary works in ancient Chinese literature. Moreover, there are even young old souls who, when writing vernacular novels, open the *Wen Xuan* and "occasionally use words from the *Fu* on mountains and seas?" As for those who read such things and "find them stilted," they can only blame their own "deficiencies in the foundation of literary cultivation."</p>
<p>Speaking seriously, since we are discussing the *Wen Xuan*, we should briefly examine the book itself.</p>
<p>First, we should know that this book was compiled 1,400 years ago. Times have changed, and literature has also changed. If someone says that it is a book from the Qi and Liang dynasties, the "foundation of youth's literary cultivation," we would have no objection. But if someone considers it a must-read for modern youth in their literary cultivation, even though we might not say anything, the compiler of the book, Xiao Tong, if he had a spirit in the afterlife, would definitely issue a declaration and telegram to protest. Even if he didn't have a spirit in the afterlife, we can still examine his writings to see his views. Didn't he say in the preface to the *Wen Xuan* that literature should "change with the times"? Therefore, during the Qi and Liang dynasties, the era when paralleled prose was at its peak, he compiled this book with a focus on profound thought and elegant language, excluding even the texts of the classics, histories, and philosophers. If he were alive today, he might compile a new *Wen Xuan*. He certainly wouldn't create another book like the *Wen Xuan* to serve as the "foundation of youth's literary cultivation" because he knows that literature should "change with the times." He wouldn't tell people to go backwards!</p>
<p>Second, we should know that Xiao Tong was a "crown prince who, with his free time after official duties, spent many leisure days browsing the literary garden and widely perusing the forest of words." He compiled this *Wen Xuan* as a model reader for the aristocratic literature of that time. Today, what we call aristocratic literature, they called palatial style. It is said that the name palatial style was established by Xiao Gang. Because Xiao Tong died, he became the crown prince. He and Xu Chi and Yu Jianwu, the leaders of the writers serving the court, liked to innovate on old texts, not adhering to old styles. The writers serving the court at that time all learned from them, and the name palatial style arose from this. Xiao Gang himself also said, "I have had a passion for poetry since I was seven years old, and I never tire of it. However, I am prone to being frivolous and elegant, so it is called palatial style." We should know that Xiao Tong and Xiao Gang had the same views on literature, that literature should "change with the times," so they "liked to innovate" and opposed revivalism. Xiao Gang said, "I have never heard of composing poems to express emotions and character, yet imitating the *Inner Regulations*; wielding the pen to write intentions, yet copying the *Admonitions on Wine*. Dragging out the long spring days, yet studying the *Returning to the Source*; staring at the clear river water, yet imitating the *Great Treatise*." From this, we can roughly understand the nature of the *Wen Xuan* and the views of its compiler. Is it that we, living today, have no other books that can serve as the "foundation of youth's literary cultivation" except the *Wen Xuan*, which the aristocratic class considered fashionable 1,400 years ago?</p>
<p>Third, we should know that teaching people to "understand some methods of writing" by reading the *Wen Xuan* will make the skeptical and eccentric old man Zhuihui laugh his jaw off. Who can prove that the methods of writing of famous modern Chinese writers come from the *Wen Xuan*? The skeptical and eccentric old man Tong once cursed the *Wen Xuan* as a "literary monster." If he saw the *Wen Xuan*, he might throw a sulfur fire at it. The old man Zhuihui writes with the spirit of "fart, fart, what utter nonsense," which he says he learned from the *He Dian*. If he saw the *Wen Xuan*, he might throw it into the latrine. Moreover, he once advocated throwing all Chinese thread-bound books into the latrine for 30 years before discussing them again! As for saying that reading the *Wen Xuan* "can expand one's vocabulary," that is not entirely true. Besides the dead words, how many living words can be transplanted into the modern writing of modern people? Besides the ancient styles of the old guard, who has seen how many words in modern writing come from the *Wen Xuan*? And are these words fresh and lively? Are modern writers all "too clumsy and straightforward in their writing, with too small a vocabulary"?</p>
<p>To speak very "clumsily and straightforwardly," I have unknowingly become too long-winded. I will "stop here."</p>
<h3 id="e284">Account of the Games <a href="#e284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>— Gao Zhi</p>
<p>The venue for the National Games was south of the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum. From the Daxing Palace in the city, there were direct buses from the Jiangnan Long-Distance Bus Company to the main gate of the stadium. The first day was Double Ten Day, and there were too many people wanting to see the games. In order to grab seats on the buses, they smashed over ten of them. The lack of orderliness surpassed even that at the train station and docks. The staff at the bus company went on strike, so going was out of the question. Later, when the buses resumed service, I decided to go and have a look.</p>
<p>Getting on the bus was a squeeze, with many white-haired old men also (pushing) forward. Sitting on the bus was also a squeeze. Since we had squeezed onto the bus, some people didn't even need to buy tickets. In Nanjing dialect, this is called "mooching," and those who were not shy about mooching were the ones wearing suits. Getting off the bus and buying entrance tickets was a squeeze, but mooching and crowding (went hand in hand). Many people rushed into the stadium through the iron gates without buying tickets. Inside the stadium, it was still crowded. If one were to say that "disorderliness" is one of the national essences, it probably wouldn't be wrong, as it was evident everywhere.</p>
<p>As I sat down in the stands, I heard the announcer on the loudspeaker telling people in the field to leave and not obstruct the games. However, those wives and young mistresses kept walking back and forth on the field. So the loudspeaker kept shouting, "(Idle people, stand outside the field!)"</p>
<p>People were constantly running around in the stands, some even bringing bread and water bottles into the stadium, combining watching the games with a picnic. As a result, there was water and trash on the ground. Sometimes a group of people would run here and squeeze there. While running and squeezing, their feet didn't care about anything and left many muddy footprints on the clean seats. So the audience behind would shout at those in front, "(Sit down! Sit down!)"</p>
<p>Soldiers were indispensable for maintaining order in the stadium. If there were soldiers in the stands, it would be a large group. But conflicts often arose with the audience. The audience only heard many soldiers shouting loudly, "(Beat them! Beat them!)" The spirit of soldiers fighting battles was on full display at the stadium.</p>
<p>The women at the stadium were all dressed up in bright and colorful clothes. All kinds of (bizarre outfits) that were prohibited by the Ministry of Interior were here. This spontaneous fashion show was indeed more interesting than a few famous socialites and young ladies temporarily wearing a few fashionable domestically produced clothes and turning around on stage. It's not easy to see so many (high-class women) normally, but at the stadium, you could see many men with great airs walking around with their daughter-like or granddaughter-like young lovers. And many (unrelated) women were walking around on the sports field. Many non-(high-class) people came to see the people and the spectacle, like visiting the Temple of the City God. They were the best at crowding, and sometimes the Boy Scouts had to shout loudly, "(Those with strength, squeeze the men, don't squeeze the women)."</p>
<p>With many people and few buses, everyone started crowding in front of the bus station from 4 p.m. onwards, scrambling to buy tickets. Crowding and more crowding. I really didn't dare (push forward) and had to take a large truck, being loaded into the city like cargo. There were more police, and each bus had (armed comrades) escorting it, which surprisingly had (unexpected effectiveness), and no more vehicles were damaged.</p>
<p>Thinking about the issue of national essence, I feel that (disorderliness) is unavoidable.</p>
<h3 id="e285">Correction <a href="#e285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>In yesterday's article "(A Point of Dissent)," the last sentence was "(I am ashamed of it)." The character (荍) was mistakenly printed as (獲). Also, in Mr. Shi Zhicun's letter to me, there was a place name (王家厙). Because I had walked in that area and seen a sign for (王家沙), I changed the character (厙) to (沙). Now someone says it should actually be (厙), and this is hereby corrected.</p>

<h3 id="e286">Two Brothers (4) <a href="#e286" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c286" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">286</a></h3>
<p>— By Maupassant, Translated by Li Weike</p>
<p>Mrs. Luc was a fair-haired woman of angular figure, so light that a mere breath of wind seemed sufficient to carry her away. Her small face seemed determined, brave, and combative, a contrast to her naturally refined disposition.</p>
<p>By reason of their similarity of temperament, she had early taken a liking to Jean. But this preference was only expressed in a barely perceptible difference of tone and glance, and sometimes when she accepted his opinions; even then it was only visible in her expression. She seemed to have guessed that Jean’s opinions would only serve to make her own the more firm, while Pierre’s would inevitably be different from hers. When she spoke of the doctor's ideas, his politics, art, philosophy, ethics, and so forth, she would sometimes say, "(You and your nonsensical ideas.)" Whereupon, he would regard her with the cold glance of a magistrate, as if he were examining a woman's lawsuit, the lawsuit of all women, poor creatures that they are!</p>
<p>Old Roland had never asked her to go fishing with him when his two sons were not at home, and he had never even taken his own wife, for he liked to start before dawn with Captain Bocquet and old Papagris the sailor. Captain Bocquet was a retired mariner whom he had met on the quay at high tide, and who had become a close friend. Old Papagris the sailor had the nickname Jean Bart (1650–1702, a famous pirate), and was employed by him to look after his boat.</p>
<p>But one evening last week, at dinner at his house, Mrs. Luc had said to him, "(Fishing must be a very interesting sport, is it not?)" Old Roland, who had been a jeweler, on hearing this, became very delighted and wished to make her share his own passion, as a missionary desires to gain converts, exclaiming, "(Will you go with us?)" "(Certainly.)" "(Shall we say next Tuesday?)" "(Yes, next Tuesday.)" "(But can you start at five o'clock in the morning?)" She gave a cry of alarm, "(Oh, no! Not so early.)"</p>
<p>He was disappointed and became cold, and at once suspected that she had no real interest in the matter. But he still asked, "(At what time can you start then?)" "(Why... at nine o'clock, perhaps!)" "(Cannot it be earlier?)" "(No, it cannot be earlier; that is quite early enough!)" The good man hesitated. So late a start would be sure to lead to nothing, for if the sun became hot the fish would no longer bite. But the two brothers hastened to smooth matters over and quickly arranged and decided everything. Thus, on the following Tuesday, Old Roland's fishing boat, the Pearl, dropped anchor at the foot of the rocky coast of Heve harbor. They fished until midday, rested for a while, and then fished again; but they caught nothing. Old Roland then knew that Mrs. Luc only cared for a sail on the sea, and did not care for fishing, and seeing that all the fishing rods remained motionless, he uttered, in an unreasonable fit of annoyance, a loud "Phew!" This long-drawn "Phew!" was directed at the indifferent widow and the unattainable fishes alike.</p>
