<p>時評</p>
<h3>英國禁令軍火供給中日</h3>
<p>英國政府爲欲减少中日糾紛擴大及流血延長之危險起見。上月二十七日决定重申一九三一年之禁止軍械出口令。實行禁運軍火供給日本及我國。同時并與其他各國接洽。冀能由各國成立一種公同協定。英政府對此之决定。其動機自不外於期望和平。弭息戰禍。一種高尚之道德。與爲人道而努力之熱忱。誠爲吾人所衷心欽敬。</p>
<p>不過英政府此舉。果遂能達到其最高尚之期望乎。換言之。即禁運軍火供給中日兩國。果足以阻遏日本之侵略暴行。弭息遠東之戰禍乎。抑且英政府此舉。果眞爲公允之辦法乎。吾人於此。亦不能不有所疑。</p>
<p>英西門外相上月二十七日在國會中報告。謂［日軍深入。實違反國聯盟約。日本擅自行動。乃國聯盟約所不許。日本行動之不與盟約相符合。已無疑義。］夫旣日日本違反國聯盟約。且毫無疑義矣。則爲維護國聯盟約之尊嚴計爲維護正義與和平計。英政府即應採取更積極有效之方法。以制止日本之侵略行動。若徒斤斤於禁運軍火。得毌過於消極迂緩。而適足以暴露國聯之怯弱無能乎。</p>
<p>抑且今日中日間之戰爭。在日爲侵略。而在我國則爲自衛。侵略與自衛意義之不同。相差天淵。英政府即眞認爲禁運軍火出口。爲弭息遠東戰爭之有效方法。亦僅應施之於處於侵略地位之日本。斷不能同樣施之於處於被侵略地位之中國。蓋日本欲得他國之軍火以侵略中國。中國則僅欲得他國之軍火以自衛。而並非以之侵略他人也。若當前英政府之所决定。毌乃失之於未認清侵略與自衛之意義。不能秉公理以爭取和平。而徒欲以公理殉和平乎。</p>
<p>况日本工業發達。其國内有製造軍火之設備。所需軍火。旣不若吾國之需要。且又可向此次在國聯大會故意棄權之不受禁令約束之某國購買。至於我國。則所謂近代之武器。大都仰給於輸入無可諱言。今英政府一律禁止軍火之供給。其於日本侵略委行爲之影響。誠極微細。而於吾國自衛行爲之打擊。則至爲鉅大。事實之結果。幾將等於助長日本之暴行。减少吾國自衛之力量。此種結果。豈亦爲英政府始願所不及乎。</p>
<p>故吾人於英政府此項决定。一方面固覺其動機爲極高尚。但另一面。則尤盼望英政府能深思熟慮。改換此種消極之政策。採取更積極有效之方法。否則［此種禁令。必無效果。］</p>
<p>徒作一種耗費甚大之姿勢。］英國之晨郵報亦旣已先吾人而言之矣。吾人更有何言。</p>
<p>雖然。國人於此一事。則應正確把握其所給予吾人之敎訓也。第一·處此暴風疾雨之時代。一國而欲自由生存。必須有充實之國防。而欲充實國防。則又必需注重軍事工業之設備。若徒仰給他人。則來源一絕。即惟有束手待人攻擊。無法鬥爭。往者固不可追矣。今後則應急謀所以補救。第二·日松岡上月二十八日在巴黎對巴黎時報記者談話。謂［各國如以大批軍火供給中國。不過供給中國軍人之自相］</p>
<p>殘殺。未見其能用以抵抗日本也。］其言雖極無理。然亦足使吾人注意。我國軍人於此。尤應有根本之覺悟。事至今日。吾人惟有堅固團結。拚血肉以禦侮已耳。他復何言。</p>

<p>（南京）　報載英政府决定禁止軍火輸往中日兩國、將侵略國與被侵略國同等待遇、事至不公、外交部某要人爲此事發表談話如下、日侵東北已逾一年、各國初猶藉口眞相不明、不欲有積極舉動、嗣經李頓調查團之報告、以及最近國聯大會通過之報告書、是非曲直乃大白於天下、日爲侵略國、我爲被侵略國、已屬毫無疑義、乃日本仍不悔禍、積極侵熱、各國依照國聯大會之報告會、與國聯盟約之精神、自應予日本以積極制裁、最低限度亦應拒絕供給日本對我作戰之工具、乃最近英政府决定禁止軍火輸往中國與日本、是不獨未將侵略國與被侵略國分别待遇、且有協助日本之嫌、蓋日本軍備充足、而我國則大部分仰給外人、禁止軍火輸出事實上之結果、中國獨蒙不利、而日本反可於更短期間内完成其熱河侵略、此誠與國聯約及國聯大會報告書之精神不符、尤與大會報告書中之［國聯會員國之通過本報告書、意在遏制採取任何行動近於妨礙］或延宕本報告書所建議之實行］之規定相違反、深堪遺憾者也、（一日中央社電）</p>
<h3>中英交涉</h3>
<p>（南京）　禁運軍火與交戰國、始倡於美國、胡佛曾一度請國會授權於總統考慮此事、我政府曾訓令駐美使署、轉達政府意見、美亦迄無具體决定、頃英國已决定禁運、對中日同等待遇、外交部要員對此曾發表談話、聞二十八日已令駐英使館向英提出異議、參事陳維城謁見西門陳述我政府意見、西門答稱、英政府此項决定、係屬暫時、中日爭端之責任、雖由國聯判定、但英政府殊難單獨决定禁止軍火輸往日本、將來國際間一致决定禁止軍火輸日英政府亦採一致行動、現信國際協定禁運軍火事、如由國聯主持、必可達到祇禁運至日本之圓滿結果云、（一日中央社電）</p>

<h3>國際行動</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）　今日國聯行政院開會時、中國代表顧維鈞聲稱、中國贊成法英所提禁運軍火至南美玻巴兩國之提議、因兩國中孰爲侵略者猶未判定也、若國聯欲建議禁運軍火至中國、則中國將堅决抗議、遠東之侵略者、業已切實判定矣、嗣行政院先在原則上通過禁運軍火至玻巴兩國、俟再詢問各會員國願否加入禁運之議後、再切實决定、現料此事或將兼詢美國、因美政府曾屢次根據國會通過之議案、禁運軍火至南美國家也、（二十八日國民電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　國聯行政院今晚舉行非公開會議、考慮英國所提出南美巴拉圭與玻璃維亞禁止軍火接濟之議案、日代表未出席、顧維鈞代表中國與會、行政院會員略有討論之後、决定各向本國政府請示、顧博士未言及遠東形勢、惟謂巴拉圭與玻璃維亞孰爲侵略國、宜决定之、今國聯對於雙方未下裁判、故渠準備贊助英國所提出之禁令、但若案情旣異、則渠將不得已提出保留云、行政院旋舉定起草委員會、準備提交各國之决議案、（二十八日路透電）</p>

<h3>飛機問題</h3>
<p>（倫敦）　因英政府决議禁止軍火運往遠東交戰國之結果、一九三一年禁止軍械出口令、行將實施、凡装成或拆散之飛機及引擎、無論民用軍用者、均在禁止出口之列、官塲解釋各項飛機列於一額之原因、爲分别飛機何者乃和平之用、何者乃供戰爭之用、殊爲困難云、（二十八日字林報專電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　今日英國飛機製造商終日包圍商部、抗議將民用飛機列入軍火之内、一同禁運于遠東、現料經此抗議後、英外相不久將宣佈變更禁運項目、將民用飛機除外、蓋英國此次禁運軍火至遠東、實際即係重施一九三一年禁運軍火出口命令、當時英國與阿比細尼亞國有禁運飛機成約、英國不得運輸飛機往該國、故將装成及折卸之民用飛機亦此在禁令之中云云、（二十八日國民電）</p>

<h3>日本實行軍政改革案</h3>
<p>東京通訊、日本帝國主義軍隊在滿洲戰爭和上海戰爭中、得到了未曾有的經騐、因爲中國民衆的積極反帝、中國士兵的英勇抗日、並有日本下級士兵在召集地和戰塲上公然的反戰、屢次打了敗仗、日本軍事當局遇着這種失敗、爲對付起見、特實行改革軍政、其策略如次、</p>
<p>第一·充實在滿兵力</p>
<p>滿蒙爲日本帝國主義進攻蘇聯的根據地、九一八以來、特别在審陽·錦州·齊齊哈爾·長春·吉林一帶、設二十餘處飛機廠、建設運輸軍隊的軍路十數線、并計劃增設兵營·軍港·建設大兵工廠、積極鞏固侵略戰爭的前進根據地、然而東北工農和士兵的破壞鐵路、襲擊城市、占領都市、却使日本軍閥感覺很大的困難、其反抗運動到現在已有五千回以上之多、日本已有疲於奔命之勢、所謂在滿兵力充實、不外用坦克車·飛機·毒瓦斯·大砲、壓迫東北義勇軍、進而向蘇聯及華北挑戰罷了、</p>
<p>第二·養成職業的兵器技術家及下　　級士官</p>
<p>日本軍隊從來採取徴兵制度、現在要養成專門操縱技術家十萬人、顯然是開始轉變向來飰兵制度、表示着徴拴　的部分崩壞、此等術家、由少年選拔、施以法西斯蒂的敎育、訓練操縱技術、海軍從去年已募集［少年航空兵陸軍今春也募］集航空通信少年兵百七十名、下級士官　　成方法、（一）充實將校學生、（二）實行短期志願將校制、（三）增加特務曹長、（四）新設養成下級特種士官機關、</p>
<p>第一·軍隊的機械化</p>
<p>改革内容、爲全軍隊之近代的武装化、製造重輕機關槍·新式野砲·重砲·高射砲·步兵砲·溜彈砲·飛機·坦克·装甲汽車·毒瓦斯等、作戰對象主要在於蘇聯和中國抗日軍隊與抗日民衆武装、飛機現在陸軍有八百三十八架、準備中者約三百、總數千一百三十八架、海軍千架、共計有二千一百三十八機、軍制改革案特别注重飛機之整備、極力計劃質的向上、其直接配屬、目下有奉天·齊齊哈爾·吉林等處、至於戰車·装甲汽車之改革、正因爲日本帝國主義戰爭的目標暗在蘇聯、戰塲當在滿蒙與西伯利亞的平原、所以日本陸軍特别加强戰車·装甲汽車、尤其是各種運輸體系之汽車化的計劃、現在日軍閥更假藉蘇聯五年計劃之生産機械化、爲軍備計劃之宣傳材料、舉出蘇聯卓拉克搭製産能率、及紅軍坦克隊的異常猛進爲口實、鼓動日陸軍之擴大與充實陸軍省發表的一列國新兵器整備一覽］、雖然舉出蘇聯戰車六○○、而日本則僅四○、那是完全欺騙的、據陸軍工廠工人傳出消息、三菱航空製作所、在上年末已完成最新式輕戰車製造號碼ＮＯ·３２５、現在已在試運轉中、由此觀之、戰車至少在三百二十五輛以上、坦克車亦有六○○輛以上、（華聯社）</p>

<p>房産會公函</p>
<p>上海房産公會·昨致上海市商會銀行業踐業同業公會函云、逕啓者溯自上海公共租界自來水公司</p>
<h3>專營以來</h3>
<p>已四五十</p>
<p>年、在民國十七年以前、并無保息之事、水費依照房租計算、爲百分之五、其調劑社會經濟、運用尚屬恰當、即物價上漲、水費亦隨房租昻貴、所以水公司之公積金所存甚多、乃於民國十七年三月十旬工部局在華董行將加入之前、復與水公司訂立新合同、許以九厘之保息、并將歷存之公積金、用紅股之方式、分配於股東、於是向不起息之公積金、一轉鱗間、變爲保息九厘之紅股、而公司之</p>
<h3>負担加重</h3>
<p>矣、水公司之負担、無非轉嫁於用戶、所幸水費仍以房租爲計算標準、不過由百分之五增爲百分之六、詎料該公司之股本、爲金錢單位在銀價下落之民國十九年、水公司以匯兑上之關係、請准工部局再加附費百分之二十五、總合房租百分之七厘半、一時輿論譁然、水公司遂用斷水手段相脅迫、社會人士、因尤憤慨工部局勉從公意、召開特别董事會議、</p>
<h3>設會研究</h3>
<p>并請美國專家希爾氏來滬調查、而所謂附費、仍在抗議下交付、希爾氏報告書、對於水公司股本單位、應用銀兩、有所暗示、而對於匯兑上之損失、應由股東負担、亦有所發揮、其給論以爲如條件適當、應用水表計費、以節制浪用、尤於不得增加貧民小戶之負担三致意焉、至於希爾氏所估水公司之資産、其價格是否過高、係另一同題、茲不贅述、乃水公司於希爾氏其他之評論與建議、</p>
<h3>一無改善</h3>
<p>獨乘日軍行將擾滬、全市恐怖之空氣中、於一月二十四日、與工部局簽訂水表合同、水費每千加侖爲銀元六角二分半、分二千加侖三千加侖五千加侖一萬加侖四級、凡不滿一千加侖者、亦作一千加侖算、其在五千加侖以上者、均作一萬加侖計算、且於弄堂房屋、僅装總表、是以節制浪費之效用、未得實現、而水費則比前增加數倍、甚有高出房租數目者、於是代水公司向用戶收彙水費之房東、深爲駭異、</p>
<h3>起而反對</h3>
<p>經敝會一再向工部局申訴、方定出拆讓辦法即照房租百分之六加四分之一、再加二者相合之三分之一以上、換言之、即至少須照房租百分之十收取装表後之水費、如是先後四五年間、水費比原百分之五者加一倍矣、其隨房租之增加而增加者、尚不在内、此種拆讓增加辦法、敝會不能表示同意、其</p>
<h3>理由有二</h3>
<p>（一）增加附費之時、曾詢據該公司總經理批亞生氏答復、謂加此附費、甚足開支一切、（二）藉装水表增加貧民小戶水費、與希爾氏報告精神不符、且於節制浪費之目的未達、遂决議一律先按七厘半水費暫行照繳、餘俟工部局及該公司與敝會三方面商定合法合理切實易行之辦法後、再行辦理、乃該公司對於此種送費、屢次拒絕、且於工部局公用委員會董事會正在討論該案之時、遽出拆斷水管、制人死命之</p>
<h3>壓迫手段</h3>
<p>現在因此斷炊飲者、已不下數萬人、言之痛心、聞之裂眦、查水費之增加、使房産業者不勝過量之負担、則劃租作息之押欵、必無以抵付、此於銀錢業之間接關係、甚爲重大、如加諸用戶、則一　平民職業、與勞動者、必須負担鉅額之水費、其生活指數更高、是與工商界之間接關係、亦屬非綱、敝會能力有限、奮鬥至今、已有力竭聲嘶之勢、素仰貴會爲百業領袖、且其事實上之利害、又屬休戚相關、用特披瀝奉陳、務請鼎力援助、並於本星期三、工部局會議以前、有所表示、則一髮千鈞、保全實大、無任迫切企禱之至、</p>
<h3>工部局方面</h3>
<p>公共租界工部局董事會、昨於召開董事會常會時、對水案亦曾略加研究、然并未有何决定、據發言人向新聲社記者宣稱、昨日董事會、已曾談及此事、但未有正式之討論、因此項問題、經私人之接洽後、現已可於最短期間内有解决之希望、雖其將近解决之内容、現尚不能發表、然據宣示、公司方面、似有妥協之可能、</p>
<h3>市商公函</h3>
<p>市商會爲水公司斷水事、昨函工部局、請嚴令恢復、原函云、逕啓者、查水爲人生所必需、其用量之多寡、初不以貧富而分、自民國十七年起、水費由依照房租百分之五、而增至百分之六、嗣又加增附費、總合計算、至百分之七厘半、凡此情形、輿論早已嘖有煩言、尤以公積金用紅股方式、分配於股東、加增保息、轉嫁用戶、爲輿論殊不平之事、蓋公司徒爲設法增加其盈利計、而絕未顧及公衆之利益也、嗣後希爾氏來滬調查、其報告書中、本以股本改用銀兩及装用水表兩事并論、且尤注意於不得增加貧民小戶之負担、而自來水公司、則專採用其装水表一事、其定價標準、與分組計算方法、均與貧民小戶利益、絕對處於相反地位、是以水費較前增加數倍、甚至有高出房租全數目者、公司自定章程、而自執行之、用戶如有異議、則藉斷水以爲挾制、此在他種貿易、尚合情理、何則買賣之事、必須兩願、不欲忽强、而顧主亦儘有選擇餘地、至於以獨占事業、而出此挾制手段、其物品　爲人生所必需、不可一日或缺、甚至較米糧尤爲重要、是直置人民於死地也、貴局以職權諭、以情理論、决不能對於該公司再取放任態度、以負市民之委托、而使一般人懷疑該公司之舉動、實蒙貴局之諒解、應請先行嚴令恢復斷水、以維市民生命、至於水價問題、則應容納房産公會納税華人會之意見、迅爲持平合理之解决、是爲至企、此致公共租界工部局、</p>
<h3>市聯會公函</h3>
<p>上海市第一特區市民聯合會、昨函公共租界工部局云、逕啓者、查市政機關、應負市民廉價清潔水料供給之責任、爲世界各國之通義、貴局負責人員、均沐浴文明、此義當均知悉、乃許水公司以保息九厘、許水公司以匯兑之贏餘、不由用戶享受、其損失須由用戶負擔、並得將歷來大宗公積金發給紅股、由資産變爲負債、致增用戶水費、已屬不顧市民利益、而遂水公司之剝削、近又装置水表、名爲制止浪用、實則藉以增費、永安公司對於初時水表帳單照付、水公司全部照收後、經上海房産公會反對、水公司方自動請减水費、經核准减爲六厘與附費、私又加重百分之二十、共爲房租百分之十、試問加此三分之一、是何理由、表費乎、制止浪費之手續費乎、究用何種科學方法計算出來乎、水公司又復不自反省、斷水勒收、以致貴局遂無能力維持市民水料之供給、殊堪痛恨、相應函請貴局、應用市民所賦之權力、迅行制止、即刻開水界内市民、當爲後盾、</p>

<h3>川江外輪聯合跌價</h3>
<p>對付華商輪船</p>
<p>川江華輪團結、競爭航運、已誌前報、滬上英美各洋商輪、特爲華輪跌減水脚、昨日召集緊急會議、討論減短水脚對付華輪之策略、亟將詳情再行查報如下、</p>
<p>跌費經過去年夏間、長江上游水漲期内、滬上英商太古怡和與美商捷江等各洋商輪、爲謀競奪川江航業起見、曾將上海運往重慶棉紗水脚、一再狂跌、減至每件祗收銀八兩、在實際上、此項運費、殊不敷成本、各洋商忍痛跌落、意在使華輪無法支持、華輪受此打擊、有陸續停業者、但各外輪所受損失、亦甚巨大、　聯合漲價三外輪於跌費時、華商新輪局民生司、適於此際成立、迨川河中國輪遭此打擊相率輟業之後、太古怡和捷江等已取得揚子江上游之航運勢力、乃聯合一線、（其時民生公司亦加入、成）、四公司合作、）將水脚飛漲、斯際華輪多停、客家装貨、祗得運載洋商輪船、由是棉紗水脚突增一倍以上、由上海直放到重慶者、每件定運價二十一兩、從宜昌轉船到渝者、亦定每件十九兩、</p>
<p>行駛船舶川江外輪自日清停航後、太古派定三船·怡和派定二輪·捷江亦派航三船、均往來上海重慶及宜昌至重慶者、若漢口到宜昌、該三洋商亦派有十餘船往來、至民生公司共有江輪八艘、行滬渝者計有四船、另有四艘、乃開航漢宜間者、至於上江之華商輪、自上年受外輪排擠後、僅留招商三北福源光耀等四家、勢力至微、</p>
<p>國輪跌價此次上江水勢、漸次漲大、重慶宜昌大型江輪、復航在在邇、國輪中福源公司、首先將上游棉紗水脚跌誠、每件減收銀二兩、而爭運上海去貨、三北等船亦相繼減跌、以與外輪競載、而乃激起外商之跌價抵制、</p>
<p>洋商減費滬上英美各外商、得聞上江華輪聯合跌價消息、由是太古怡和捷江民生等四公司、於昨日在捷江公司樓上、召集四公司代表、開緊急會議、以當此　水將領、下游去貨發動之際、華輪旣減、則四公司仍聯合一致、亦急起直追、將上海運赴重慶慶之棉紗水脚、即日起一律跌減、自上海装赴重慶直接水脚減爲十六兩、由宜昌轉去者、亦跌至十四兩、照原定價減收五兩、自今日起實行、</p>
<h3>民生公司負責人談川江中外輪始終合作</h3>
<p>申時電訊社本埠消息、記者以日前報載川河國輪大團結抵抗洋商輪之襲斷消息、引起中外航運業之注意、昨特往訪生公司滬方負責人員探詢眞相、據稱</p>
<h3>民生公司</h3>
<p>渝滬漢各地主持人、平素雖與［招商］［三北］各公司友誼夙深、但在營業上則各自爲謀、不相聞問、旣無同盟之動機、亦無同盟之必要、至［浹江榆］係一小報關行、並無輪船行駛川江、即據歷年航運統計、亦無所謂［永興］輪隻行走長江上游也、且川江</p>
<h3>貨少船多</h3>
<p>水脚極低、故中外各輪公司、装運貨物、莫不拆蝕、倘長此不圖補救、勢必再度自由競爭、中外航商有鑒於此、遂於去冬一致主張增加水脚、實非任何方面所能獨創也、又如最近减價、亦係中外共同意見所促成、是乃春水漲發時應有之現象、亦非任何人從中漁利、之單獨舉動也、如此可見中外各公司團結合作、始終如一、再者、民生公司</p>
<h3>發展航運</h3>
<p>之計劃、現已告一段落、在最近數年内、擬暫不添建輸隻、專注全力於四川内部實業之開發、如創立水電廠·水門汀廠·鍊焦煤廠·等項事業、殊不願與外商作無謂之競爭、而自毁其方築成之基礎也、</p>

<h3>體育與民衆健康問題復徐先孚君來函</h3>
<p>答：足下來書暢談中國體育問題，所言固未能盡爲我輩所首肯，然對於中國體育界的弱點的批評，實是見道之言。不過我們就事實説話，所謂體育實與農民工人無與。而　謂［體育救國］也，不過是等於什麽［美術救國］，［游藝救國］的花頭的一樣。</p>
<p>足下所提出的兩個［救濟］的意見，在下述的條件之下，我們是贊成的：（一）軍事訓練不限於城市的學生，而要普及於一般大衆，（二）本來美國有些學校不另設體育一課，而只注重學生的生産勞動與校内外生活的服務，在這種勞動與務中級，自然發生了運動的效能，而且與［生活即是敎育，敎育即是生活］這種敎育的信條吻合。至於中國大部分人！！農人及工人！！的健康問題，不在什麽體育，而在下述的幾個問題：（一）大部分農民呻吟憔悴於苛捐雜税，重利盤剝之下，怎樣去救濟？（二）［一八六，○○○，］○○○的無土地的農民］怎樣使得他們有田可耕，不至　日價　沛流離，俄着肚子來聽我們講求衛生與健身？（三）城市的工人每日的過度勞動使他們的體力枯竭，不能充分地再生産他們的勞動力，他們的生命自然是比我們短促；而且他們的住屋！！所謂貧民窟！！不如有錢人的豬欄，更不如大富翁的狗窩，所以工人們十有八九都有肺病，用什麽方法來做根本之救濟？（四）失業的工人成千成萬，饑寒交迫他們不但不　什麽體育，即使　得，也只有掩耳而走。我們第一步怎樣使得他們不致没工作，没飯吃？（五）城市商店的［店員］，（這在上海及）其他大都市除了工廠工人外），是一個唯一的嚴重問題。他們自早至晚伏處在商塲中，旣無新鮮空氣可以呼吸，又無餘暇可以增進體力與智力，我們怎樣救濟他們這樣苦痛？我們覺得這些問題才是國家社會之最大多數人的最迫切的問題，足下所研究的只是替少數社會階層想方設法，我們覺得殊不値得。而且他們崎形的體育的現象，也不是偶然而生的，乃是現在的社會制度之必然的結果。足下最後提出［現代西洋文明的眞髓］做結論，説現代的西洋文明的眞髓在於：［一是供給的力量，一是支配的力量］，這話固然很有意思，然而在二十世紀的今日，那經過歐洲大戰，俄國革命的今日而言［西洋文明的眞髓］，那就不得不進一步地做一個更精密的追求；即：現在的西洋文明有兩種：一種是社會主義式的西洋文明：一種是資本主義社會的西洋文明，他們都有［供給的力量］與［支配的力量］，足下所説的西洋文明，究是前者抑後者呢？這其間的差别非常嚴重是不許我們忽視的，敢間！</p>

<p>潘局長講辦播音之意義</p>
<p>市敎育局舉辦無線播音、已於昨晚開始、地點爲中西大藥房播音臺、由潘局長親自演講本局舉辦播音的意義、今晚由第四科陳科長演講努力識字運動、以後每逢星期三四下午七時至七時三十分、　中西大藥房、星期六假大中華電器公司按時播音、演講人員、除由核局職員担任外、尚聘請各專家担任云、又該局舉辦之電音補習班、亦於昨晚開始講授、由謝福生担任英語講師、謝君對於英國語文、極有研究、將來嘉惠學員、實非淺衅、所有公民國語二科、已聘定鮑忍杰君担任、星期一三五爲英語科、星期一四國語、星期六公民、嗣後繼續相間講授、時間均爲九時至十時、</p>
<h3>潘公展演講詞</h3>
<p>（一）現在國家危急到了萬分了、我們要想抵　外侮、把國家民族的生命保守着、非使全國同胞了解我們現在所處的境地是怎樣的危險、明嘹各人自已　責任一齊下决心、團結想來救國不可、敎育最大目的在求［延續民族的生命］、當此國家存亡、千鈞一髮、民族的生命、受到重大威脅的今日、我們辦敎育的人是不能忽略本身所負的使命的、本局對於本市敎育力所能及靡不盡心推進、對於敎育上的救國工作、尤再三致意、所以在不久、以前曾頒行雪恥救國方案、對在校學生予以救國的敎育、希望他們一個一個都能盡國民的本份、在救國的大工作上、各盡一部份的力量、但是以現在人校學生之少、社會上民衆之多、若是我們祗單注意到學校敎育方面的話、我們所能希望的成效一定有限得很、因爲這個緣故、我們對於社會敎育的設施、更是十二萬分的注意、因爲社會敎育的對象是非常龐大、其影響所及的範圍、也至爲廣闊、在這方面、我們除設立民衆學校補習學校以救濟年長失學的民衆、并責成附屬社會敎育機關努力工作從各方面一齊着手進行外、我們運隨時隨地、考察社會情形、利用機會來推進社會敎育、本局舉辦無線電播音、就是這種用意、</p>
<p>（二）現在、無線電播音收音的設置在上海可算是盛極時了、無線電播音台所在皆有、中産以上人家、大置備收音機以爲娛樂之資、但是、我們祗稍爲考究一下、播音台所常播的是些什麽、收音者所愛聽的又是些什麽、我們考究了之後、就會覺得非常的失望原來到現在、大多數的播音台還在那裏專播些平劇·彈詞·蘇灘之類些的東西、收音的也專歡迎這些單純以娛樂爲目的、或者運含着不正常意念的節目、我們在路上跑的時候、兩旁商店的收音機有時還會送出［毛］毛雨］［妹妹我愛你］等　音來、總之、在收音者方面大多數旣以享受低級的娛樂爲其購備收音機的目標、在播音者方面就當然投其所好、競以低級歌曲供給大家、（但這裏所説的）［低級］、并不是指的歌曲的格調、而是指的歌曲的内容）就上面所説來判斷、無線電播音收音兩方現在大多數都没有達到其應有目的、這是我們所認爲可惜不過的、</p>
<p>無線電播音收音的功能言、在播音台發出一種聲音、凡有收音機的、無慮相隔千里、祗須將機括　好、便可清晰聽到一切、恍如對面這奇妙的工具、要是收播兩方能利用得適當、其效力眞不可言喻、現在我們舉辦播音就是爲的要造改革的嘗試、我們要利用播音機來做社會敎育的工具、播這敎育節目、我們要試試聽衆諸君到底有没有享受高尚娛樂的心情、我們要看看聽衆諸着對於救國是不是眞有力行的决心、</p>
<p>（三）我們舉播音的意義、可以用兩句話來總括就是推行社會敎育、閘揚三民主義、</p>
<p>總理説、三民主義、就是要敎導大衆知道怎樣去救國關於這一點、我們有總理遺敎重要革命紀念、國恥紀念重要時事之解剖報告等節目、一方面我們還要供給大衆以一般實用知識、所以衛生方法、時令病預防公民指導、各種節目、我們也都預備播送、我們還借一個無線電播音補習班敎授應用科目、我們的講演、務求淺近而富有興趣、不使聽衆有厭煩的感想、此外還有兩點値得報告的就是、第一、黨部各委員本市市長和各局局長和社會上許多名人、將來　會來擔任播音、聽衆有聽他們偉論的機會、第二我們對於尚高娛樂、將來也、盡力提供、給予聽衆諸君以一種滋生新生命的［愉快］</p>
<p>（四）希望本市備有收音機的先生們贊助這種社會敎育事業、利用你們的收音機、收受必須的聲音、還要延請親友一同聽受、或指導屬員到部報名人播音補習班學習、没有收音機而有購買的能力的先生們、也趕快購買收音機、利用他來敎育自已、來敎育子弟、</p>

<h3>昨晚女籃球賽兩江敗於西聯</h3>
<p>結果二十六比十八最近兩江四戰四敗</p>
<p>兩江女子籃球隊昨晚又以十八比二十六敗於西僑女子聯隊、最近四戰四敗、實爲籌備出國比賽之大不幸事也、觀該隊球員、與以前奪取西青錦標時、完全無異、目增一席均、惟其技術方面、不覽大爲退步、擲籃失取目標、陳容殊見慌亂不整、加以犯規素累、使任裁判者難於行使職權、照目下情形、該隊如欲出國比賽、務須加工訓練、免得日後予異邦人士以不良之印象、</p>
<p>昨戰形勢昨晚中華籃球房、觀衆頗見踴躍、惟此比賽精彩殊少、兩江旣如一盤　沙、而無出色表演、西聯亦覺平平、良以其挑選各西隊健者組織、各　技術、雖有可觀、但不能互通聲氣、故局勢平凡、興趣淡薄、兩江則始終屈居人下、頭角未露、分數最近時爲四分、</p>
<h3>比賽經過</h3>
<p>八時一刻開賽、裁判周家騏角逐未久、西聯潑林斯首中一球、往後兩江頻頻犯規、西聯連罰八次、竟無中的、兩江則由陳榮明賴罰球得一分西聯傑漢生連中二球、總計第一節之比數、爲八比二、西聯勝、第二節形勢、頗見緊張、兩江　四比六落後、上半時總計爲十四比七、下半時起、西聯調動、三人、實力大减、兩江乘機猛襲、頗爲得利、待第三節終、　江多三分、總計十六比二十、尚差四分、但第四節中、兩江未能超出、末了反被西聯勇將白　乃特女士投中兩球、結果遂成二十六比十八、歸西聯勝利、</p>

<h3>所望於中國國貨公司者</h3>
<p>— 薛光前</p>
<p>近年以來，國貨運動，風起雲湧，然欲吏盡人樂用國貨，須先使人人知國貨出品之優點，及有購求辦認之便利，於是滬上熱心國貨志士，有中國國貨公司之設。開幕以來，營業鼎盛，足徴滬上人士之愛用國貨，而國貨亦自有其實質上被愛之價値，非一時懵感衝動，或受宣傳作用而趨之若鶩者，可斷言也。雖然，凡百右業，創辦之初，計劃容有未週，簡陋自所難免，中國國貨公司當非例外。有曾往購貨者歸而語人，在深慶從茲得有純粹的經售國貨機關之餘，對於設備種種方面均表示有未能盡如人意之處，竊以爲社會人士之望於中國國貨公司者，至爲心切，凡有出於善意的責備或建議，正應藉以警惕，故余樂爲彙記於次，所冀中國國貨公司當局，對茲求全之與論，有則固應改善，無則益自加勉，而於種種之建議，認爲適當可行者，立即實施，務使一事一物，盡善盡美，造成國人理想中的國貨公司，企予望之。</p>
<p>一地方較小，買客一多，擁擠不堪。初次蒞臨者，尚不介意：倘長此擠軋購貨不得，不免令人望而却步。</p>
<p>二貨物種類，似嫌太少。如牙刷，牙粉，熱水瓶等，祇有一種牌子，如有用慣或心好他種牌子而欲購置者，即不可得。縱勉强購此僅有之牌子，心中殊不痛快。</p>
<p>三貨物花色尚未齊備，如綢緞，呢絨，　　布疋等，不如普通商店之俱備，致不能令人有任意揀選之滿意。</p>
<p>四某部店員，殊不注意買客，及至買客招呼後，店員間又彼此互相推諉，不肯上前，引起買客不良之印象。</p>
<p>五店員大都似乎怕麻煩，對顧客少殷勤　接待，如能添設一二和顏悦色之招待員，各方應付周旋，縱不能使買客個個滿意而去，亦可減少種種無意之待慢。</p>
<p>六走廊中似應多置靠椅，以備老幼婦孺者之休息。</p>
<p>七收銀櫃手續太慢，使顧客不忍久待（此叵亦增加擁擠之一源，）似應設法改善。</p>
<p>八公司旣名［中國，］應搜羅全國各地國貨，不能徧採上海一隅，俾名符其實九中國絲綢，應多加提倡，一則因其質地堅固，經久耐穿，確非舶來品所及，二則在此中國絲業頺衰趨勢之下，推廣絲綢銷路，亦所以謀萬一挽救之道。</p>
<p>十應添設南貨一部，以南貨爲家家日常需用之品，而其中外貨亦最多，如魚翅，蝦米（即俗稱開洋，）干員，海參，凍粉（即俗稱洋菜）……以及白糖等等，尤爲大宗。如有南貨部之設，必能增加購求者辨認時之便利不少。</p>
<p>十一上樓時，所見懸掛之一幅畫，似無意義，如能改懸名産湘繡之類，較爲可意。</p>
<p>十二樓下門面，空爲陳列，不做生意，似不經濟。如能將化妝品綢緞等主要營業，移之下層，並可使樓上不使太感侷促。</p>
<p>十三中國國貨公司二樓，有門與大陸商場相通，内中亦有各色店舖，如不將此門關斷，在買客不識何者屬中國國貨公司之商店，何者爲非，將來買客如有對於此等店舖，發生不滿，中國國貨公司不免代人受過，此點應否加以考慮，要不無研究之價値也。</p>

<h3>國貨工廠當前的一個急争問題</h3>
<p>— 潘仰葊</p>
<p>最近上海國貨工廠在一星期中，連續發生兩件大不幸事，一件是正泰橡膠廠的鍋爐爆炸，慘死男女工八十餘人，開空前未有之慘劇。不料不到一星期，永和實業製造廠，又以電線走火，蒸缸爆炸，死傷男女工役數二具。這兩件很慘酷的事，偏偏發生於努力造産的國貨年中最最痛心的。又是我們辦國貨工廠的，經此巨創，痛定思痛，平日裏對於工廠的安全設備，從今以後，應有急切注意的必要。</p>
<p>大凡生産的要素有三種：一是土地，二是勞力，三是資本，土地必待勞力資本的運用，而後可以開發，而勞力和資本，更應希望他逐漸增加，不致受到意外損害。許多的工廠機器轉動，齒輪密布，化學原料，種類複雜，偶一不愼，大禍立至，不但工人生命，重的傷亡，輕的殘廢，極慘痛；即是機械損壞，工作停頓，房屋炸毁，産業全隳，資産損失，也很可惜。以歐美各國如此的注重安全設備，尚且危險的事時常發生。英美德法各國，均有注意非常事變律及種種化學品易於爆裂物之取締，於工人之安全衛生，無微不至。姑就安全設備中的樓梯一項而講；英國一九○一年之工塲法規，定樓梯每步的板面，至少爲十吋，兩步間距離高度至多爲七吋半而倫敦市建築法，更規定有二百人出入的樓梯，其闊度應爲四呎六吋，四百人以上的，每百人加增六吋，加至闊九呎爲止。美國紐約市建築法，規定五十人出路的樓梯，至少四呎闊，每加五十人須加六吋。樓梯生步之板面，至少爲十吋半。兩步間之距離高度，亦不３</p>
<p>得過七吋半。即此區區樓梯一項，似乎無足重輕，但爲防火安全計，他們不能不這樣的鄭重規定。回看我國，近年以來，潮流所趨，勞動界只知要求提高生活，改善待遇，然工運失了正當的指導，法規也没有相當的保障，以致工會所爭的，十之九都是加增工資，而工人切身利害的安全設備，反而置諸腦後。工廠領袖也是忙於應付工潮，周轉資金，和注意産銷問題，而工廠利害切身的安全設備，也是認爲綏圖。以致一星期中，　出了二大慘劇，眞是十分痛心，十分可惜的事。希望今後辦工廠的，趕快覺悟，要注意下列各點不要出了亂子，再來補救才是。</p>
<p>（一）各工廠應特聘富有經騐之安全工程師，計劃各種安全設備，以達保全機器維護人道的目的。</p>
<p>（二）以後建造廠屋，最好應用鋼骨凝和圡，以免火險。廠房不堅固的趕快改造，不要吝惜小費。</p>
<p>（三）凡危險可慮之地，應置各種記號於最注目之處，以警告工人。其記號應敷以紅色油漆，上漆白字。</p>
<p>（四）廠屋内應多設太平門及太平扶梯，在工作時間，太平門不可鎖閉。（五）鍋爐間及機器間，蛭少有出入門戶兩處以上。</p>
<p>（六）廠屋内應多置自來水龍頭，並安置長關適宜之皮帶。（七）鍋爐間引擎間，或儲有爆炸物品之所，應和其他房屋隔離。（八）如鍋爐間引擎間，與其他廠屋接連的，應互相隔絕，其隔牆應以磚或鋼骨凝和土成之，至少須十二吋厚。</p>
<p>（九）爆炸物儲藏之所，須暢通空氣，凡易於因油類而着火之處，須置鉛桶儲沙，以便施救。</p>
<p>（十）鍋爐上的保險汽門須時常試騐，當汽壓增至預定最高度時，能否開始放汽（十一）廠内應備警鐘或其他警號。</p>
<p>（十二）廠中工人及職員應組織消防隊，時常練習施救方法。　　以上所舉，不過大略情形。欲知其詳。可參閲上海市社會局所輯之工廠安全設備須知。（機聯會亦有印行）凡是辦工廠的同志，不可不人手一册，以資準備。此外關於救護工人的設備，升降機的設備，速度和氣壓的限制，觸電的防範，這書都有詳細的説明，希望大家無論怎樣的忙，總該注意一下，利人利已，眞是功德無量。</p>
<p>編餘</p>
<p>拚命做去創立工廠易，而管理工廠難，管理因貴合於科學方法，尤貴有安全的設備。這一星期中，上海兩大工廠，發生鍋爐爆裂，死傷職工的慘劇，我們除先爲兩工廠致慰以外還要勸告兩工廠當局，不要灰心，須知多一次挫折，增一次經騐，多一次禍患，加一次謹愼，在這國貨年頭，我們惟有用努力造産，奮鬥到底八個字來，咬緊牙關拚命的做去。</p>
<p>流動展覽有位松江吳品禪君，致函本刊，他説：［在我國今日所處環境之］下，舍努力服用國貨外，别無生路。所以他在本鄉規定這年内發起一個會，專爲服用國貨，想籌備一個小小的國貨展覽會，使一般鄉民人人腦際，都有國貨的觀念和認識，不過要徴求適於鄉間的國貨商品，倒很困難，請本刊指導云云。記者認爲他的提議很有價値，我很希望上海各工廠領实袖，把日用的平民的出品，用流動的展覽會方法，分赴各鄉開會一方展覽，一方宣傳，使優良廉價的國貨，深中鄉民腦海，比了廣告的效力，要大數十倍，大家不妨一試。</p>
<p>所謂芝博會中國參加芝加哥博覽會徴品展覽會開幕了，記者化了半天工夫，前去一看，覺得大大失望，眞是可憐之至，會塲布置，也許時間匆促，草草了事。會中値得稱許的，似乎是瓷器，陶器，漆器三種，還可以説得上有參加的價値。可是仔細一想，這許多出品缺點有三：一是太貴族化，平民那裏用得起，那裏可以代表全民生活的一般。二是少實用，不是高齋清供，便是摩挲把玩，或僅供景仰崇拜之資曷足以代表新中國的工業精神。三是缺乏科學，一切出品，都是静的，没有動的，都是蹈常襲故，没有新的發明，滿屋子裏死氣沉沉，古董一堆，那裏可以代表新中國的民族精神？只有丢醜，那可發揚？但是話又説回來，在幼稚的工業國家，能有許多國貨出現。已算難能可貴，至此只好聊以自慰，而辦事的人也可於此卸責了。</p>
<p>主婦之責葛成慧女士，在普益社講［婦女在國貨年應有的責任］從撫養小孩子説起，説得眞是透澈。最佩服的一句話：［是婦女的用國貨，不比男子都是］空話，是有權力的，有經濟實權的，婦女祇要有决心，不怕什麽。］好極了，這幾句話，女太太們小姐們千萬要牢牢記着。</p>

<h3>歪理十八正理十九</h3>
<p>— 嗬廬</p>
<p>不可思議的常言俗語，一到相當的時候自會成談，最近成識的有兩句俗語，呌做：！歪理十八條，正理只一條。</p>
<p>但，在提出歪理的一方面，决不自認爲歪理，一定認爲堂堂正正的公理。這番，出席日内瓦的日本松代表，眞個名副其實的松代表；副的什麽？副的這個松字，副的這個［十八公］組成的松字。他在議席上曾經屢次發言，横一條理由，竪一條理由，歪十八條，都成了公理；奇哉又怪哉！松代表的十八公。</p>
<p>世界道理一共十九條，依着：！歪理十八條，正理只一條，的方式，可見十八條都是歪理，輪到十九條才是正理。所以，没有十九國特委會，十八公辯才無礙，十八條歪理都成了公理；一有十九國特會的公正報告着，那麽十八公的十八條公理，返本還原而爲十八條歪理了。咄！十八敗於十九，矮子免開尊口。</p>
<p>本來，打牌九所爭的只在一點，十九當然勝十八，何况是長的十九，短的十八？</p>
<h3>和平軍</h3>
<p>— 賢妻</p>
<p>丨曷不釜底抽薪？！</p>
<p>滬戰時提倡和平軍計劃的英國女敎士，羅登據路透電説，現在重申前議，預備集合嗜好和平的男女，把肉體做屏障，置於熱河的兩軍隔地中間，藉以阻止戰爭。</p>
<p>這種消息，給我們愛好和平的中國老百姓聽着，甜津津的多麽夠味。</p>
<p>本來這種摩頂放踵的苦肉計，完全是基於人道的立塲的。兩軍對峙着，無情的砲火，專以血肉造成的人體爲目標，這是多麽慘酷的一回事。我們這些落伍了的老百姓雖覺得津津有味但黷武國的軍閥們，還不値一笑置之。因爲這幾天報紙上常有［日軍屠殺難民］的紀載，這就夠證明，黷武國軍閥的志趣，是多殺一人好一些的，甚麽上帝，甚麽博愛，俺可一概不管。在這種情形之下，羅登女敎士提倡的和平軍，萬一成爲事實，也不過造成黷武國的殺人記錄之一頁而已。對於戰事上有甚麽效果，據我大近視眼看，不客氣，零而已。</p>
<p>現在的［文明國家］的戰爭，全靠飛機上亂擲炸彈，把無辜平民，轟炸個寸草不留，纔算威武。所以祈禱和平的和平軍，站在二軍陣線之間，雖然强盜發善心，没把他們當作槍靶子，可是在和平軍背後、没命的把炸彈往下扔、請問和平軍有没有跳在半空裏阻止扔炸彈的妙策　　據我看，還是每人揑了一炷安息香，跪求各本國政府，禁止軍火運日，那或許倒是最穩妥可靠的辦法哪　。</p>
<h3>肉</h3>
<p>— 朱黻</p>
<p>丨説不完，話不盡丨</p>
<p>孟子上説：［六十者衣帛食肉，］那現代最普通的葷菜：［肉］。却成爲當時特殊階級誀用的異味。［食肉］者］是紳富階級的代名詞。那曹劇説的［食肉者鄙］，和錦衣肉食，庖有肥肉，都是描寫朱門的豪富的話了。齊桓公要表示他擁護周室，定要下拜受胙。孟母要訓子以信，就買了豚肉談兒。陳平的分肉，是宰天下的雛型。那位飢欲死的東方朔，更窮兇極惡的拔劍割肉，説什麽［歸遺細君，抑何仁也！］還有孔老夫子，也把三月不知肉味，來贊美聞韶之樂。肉、確乎古代的特殊異味、一班肉的崇拜者，都在那一片肉上，做着功課！</p>
<p>我國的吃，是很考究的；一味肉，也製成各各不同的滋味。出名的：有鎭江的肴肉，金華的南肉，廣東的燒肉，還有醬猪肉，四喜肉，東坡肉，！！都煑得肥腴鮮美，使饕餐者吃得舐嘴咂舌，書之經傳，誌之史册。我鄉的蘇州人，到了年底，也須把臘肉，鹹一次，醬一次，風着了等到春笋上市，取下來和笋煑食。那臘肉的香味，眞把癆饞者的鼻子拉長三尺。</p>
<p>不知那個創造個［肉屏風］，於是肉的範圍，竟擴展到女人身上。那出賣皮肉的女　性，就喚做了鹹肉，還定了什麽三元一刀，五元一割的肉價。那白白的肉臂，這麽一揮，膩膩的肉腿，那麽一蹺，肥肥的肉臂，這麽一扭，高高的肉乳，那麽一顫，據説：這一揮，一蹺，一扭，一顫，就呌做［肉感。］於是靠着揮蹺扭顫的藝術最高峯的肉感舞，報紙的廣告上，竟刊出了肉香四溢！啊！多香艶的肉感文章：肉蒲團！！。</p>
<p>東三省給敵人併吞後，東三省的同胞，就變做了聽人宰割的爼上肉，在僞國中度着待斬的亡國奴日子。一班抵抗的健兒，却拚着血肉之軀，和强敵的飛機，重砲，坦克車肉搏。東北一角上，天天在砲火連天，血肉横飛中度着歲月。現在北票失守，熱河危急全國同胞　都快成强食者口中的　肉了！内地的食肉者，能否省下吃肉的錢，來購買抗日的飛機，和改變火綫的肉摶，一致加入抗日的肉搏火線。</p>
<h3>航空救國運動歌</h3>
<p>— 錢小山</p>
<p>聖人用兵不得已。今日戰爭恃利器。吁嗟九一八與一二八。國民如何雪國恥。目前戰略重國防。第一航空先整理。吾人切勿再觀望。朝陽開魯大戰始。中國同胞四萬萬。快快傾囊毋後至。須知國亡家不存。救國救家原一致。捐成飛機一千架。組織空軍揚漢幟。乘風浩蕩出關門。東荑不敗將何俟。我思各機關與各學生。熱血從人豈後人。値此機會不救國。後來痛苦向誰伸　。小子平生不敢自暴棄。頗擬社會詩人白居易。思將通俗七言歌。告我國人共興起。但花願天酒地肉食者。停杯投筋先贖此。</p>
<h3>雄的比雌的美顏</h3>
<p>— 波光</p>
<p>丨女人比男子美？丨</p>
<p>司晨的雄錫，守夜的黑犬，更有山上的雉……都是雄的比雌的美。</p>
<p>鮮紅的高冠，金黄的羽毛，雄壯的鳴聲，它的美麗是引誘雌的跟隨，免去自已的淘汰。犬，雄的毛比雌的光澤，健壯。山雉更不必説了，雄的當然美麗得多。世界上一切的生物，都逃不了天然的雄的美麗！</p>
<p>女人比男子美嗎？這倒難以確定，白古有四大美人，西施，貂蟬，貴妃，照君。照舊小説是説它們，有［沉魚落雁］之容，閉月羞花之貌。］但是男子，自古也有潘安，宋玉，城北徐公。究竟女人比男子美不？</p>
<p>現代什麽都講美化，藝術化，裸體美，曲綫美。把幾個摩登女子鬧得頭昏，燙髮咧，點唇咧，盡眉咧……研究伊們的用意，無非要人稱聲美。</p>
<p>男子呢？也學着在修飾上用功夫！其實不装飾，也自有天然的美存在。</p>
<p>現在各學校提倡健康美，使青年的男女走到樣素的途上去免得養成了奢侈的習慣。這是對於社會上的一種好現象！但男子總比較女人來得健美，這是男女都除去了修飾的話。</p>
<p>小説</p>
<h3>田莊主</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>汪……汪……汪……突然，倭子隊裏又起了一陣紛擾。方才在村口的一塲大戰裏，生在崇明，長在崇明的六位狗英雄，已有一半是很壯烈地爲着崇明而戰死了；不曾死難的三位，在把混身的黄毛染成了鮮紅色之後，已一度隨阒它們的老生人，！田莊主！退進林子中來了。但是，當老五的請求被田莊主拒絕的時候，它們便帶着傷，第二度泅水過河，决意盡它們的微薄的力量，給小鈴們经相當的突圍的機會。</p>
<p>［汪……汪……汪］抓啊！咬啊！撲啊！這時候的它們已有了猛虎一般的雄威；憑他的倭刀怎樣犀利，在没有把它們的身子完全截斷之前，簡直不生效力。一條犬差不多可以敵十個倭子，戰鬥延長了三四十分鐘。</p>
<p>［嗚……嗚］得勝的號角，在隔河吹着，倭子們開始坐下地來休息了；兩位小烈士，三位狗英雄，已在相差不遠的時間上，完成了他們的殺身成仁的宏願。</p>
<p>林子裏寂静無聲，在微弱的星光下，舉行了一個幽默的喪禮。　　四十歲的寡居的姑母，很興奮地率領着老大老二們的妻子，捧出了許多藥膏和布帶來，替受傷的戰士們一一包裹；田莊主斜睨着伊們，在沉毅的臉上，現出得意的微笑。</p>
<p>［準備過夜的東西去］！姑母又亂着去辦理後方工作去了　［我們還剩幾個人］？田莊主深信倭子的暫時停止進攻，絕對不是生了什麽畏懼心，更不是受了那一條不滿二丈闊的小河的阻擋，乃是大舉猛攻的休息；因此老人在晚餐之前，便忙着在環莊圈的林子裏積極佈防。</p>
<p>把已受重傷和輕傷的人一起計算在内，田家莊上所有的兵將，恰好是五十個人，！兩個由趙大哥所替出來的燒飯司務，也列入隊伍中來了。！防禦綫的單弱，已在無可諱言的事實。立刻使富於作戰經騐的田莊主感覺到一種不能形容的凄凉和悲憤，但是他依舊極鎭定，用最樂觀的態度，向每一個戰士激勵了一番。（八）</p>
<p>世界珍聞</p>
<h3>朝鮮的妓女</h3>
<p>— 若墓</p>
<p>［晉州的妓女比蒼蝍還多三倍。］這是朝鮮的諺語。我們從這一句話的意味中，便可以知道朝鮮的妓女的數目之多了。從來，朝鮮産妓女的地方，大都是京城，平壞，晋州，全州及海州等。然而妓女最美麗而且最聽明伶俐的，當首推平壤了。並且平壤的妓女，似乎在各方面都優秀些。</p>
<p>説到平壤的妓女，眞是有趣得很！在那裏居然有了所謂妓女學校，自然，這種學校便是優秀的妓女的養成所，在那裏面收容着十歲以上十五歲以下的女子，每天授課的時間，定在午前十時始至午後五時止。課目有歌舞，音樂，一書，習字，詩歌，繪畫，修身，國語及漢文等，在這種學校中竟有修身這一課目，也許是一件奇特且新鮮的事罷。</p>
<p>因此，朝鮮妓女，從前有不少頗具才能的，就是近來的妓女中，也還有着很多能詩能畫者，最有趣的，伊們繪起畫來，總逃不出所謂［四君子］的梅蘭竹菊這一類東西。那些比較不大風雅的妓女，所最歡喜的當然是［春　］了，或許這些妓女是未熟讀修身之故也未可知。　　並且妓女中也有會做漢詩的，這一件事似乎更是難能可貴的了！現在殘留着的妓女所作的詩歌之中，有不少纒綿悱惻的作品在着。例如·成川妓研舟的詩：［君重送妾涙妾亦含涙］歸；願作陽臺雨，更灑郎君衣。］又如琴哥的詩：［長興洞裏初分手，乘馬橋邊暗斷魂！芳］草斜陽離别後，落花何處不思君？］像這樣的詩，我們不能不説它是别具風趣的。此外能以日本文字寫詩的更多，確是指不勝屁，如柳自新，金光煜，桂浪，李之翼等人都曾經做過不少的好詩。這樣風雅多才的妓女，恐怕在中國也是少有的，不，大膽地説一句，現代的中國妓女中是找不出一二人來的。</p>
<p>同時，朝鮮的妓女也和中國的妓女一樣，有着很悠久的歷史，自高麗朝使妓女出入於五宫以來，就漸漸地繁盛起來，尤其在李朝，妓女之勢更大盛。李朝曾有着四種官妓，那就是（一）藥房妓，（二）尚衣院妓，（三）惠民署妓，（四）活人署妓等，九世宗朝曾出令各郡選拔妓女若干人，使其學習詩歌，漁父辭，春眠曲，相思别曲，勸酒歌，男舞，僧舞，劍舞，鼓等。這些學習官妓，每月一日及十五日須到所屬官廳去，尤其是藥房所管的妓女，須每月一次參朝。</p>
<p>妓女許多是世襲相傳的，但良家婦女被出入高貴權門這一點的虎虚榮所眩惑而去做妓女的也不少，爲了經濟的關係而不得不去做妓女的當然更多了。</p>
<p>可見朝鮮的妓女之所以如此多，並且妓女之所以都有文才，决不是偶然，不消説是有伊的歷史的根據。</p>

<h3>紗花美减種案傳已通過</h3>

<p>紗市晨疲午漲、但趨勢仍疲軟不振、因實銷冷澹、各帮進胃甚滯、且時局益趨嚴重、銀根愈緊、商業殊難發展、而天津棉紗、運滬絡繹不絕、但有一部份因其底盤關係、傾向做多、然大勢不良、存貨太厚、壓力仍重云、</p>

<h3>糧食標粉一致鬆動</h3>
<p>丨供多求少：益難振作丨</p>
<p>昨日粉市上午開盤後、各月份呈初平繼跌之象、以洋麥報價微好一二角、初開市氣尚平、惟市塲人心異常不振、因目下各廠籌碼轉動、如兵船老車等均可照標準直抽、不加限制、可知粉底之充實、已無疑義、兼之北方時局愈重、銷塲或須暫受打擊、市氣遂見步疲、無振作之氣、迨至下午開盤、本月份市面仍不穩、因業外多頭紛紛回出、津帮上午略進、下午見觀望、氣勢更覺暗淡、遠期亦因買戶家落、一致鬆動、此後如供多求不敵、前途尚難樂觀、結果本月份較前月收盤跌一分七釐半、四月份跌二分半、五六月份跌一分二釐半、七月份跌一分、八月份已循例開拍、開價一兩七錢五分半、後無上落云、</p>
<h3>近期麥跌落四五分</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市在、均見鬆落之象、洋麥報價雖曾好一二角、但當前難關、則在洋麥之湧到、各慶所定者固無論矣、行家定貨亦已陸續進日、而實際去化、則苦於廠方之不動、業外買戶、自少購買之力、所以近期月份遂被迫壓小、遠期亦因洋麥可定、人心終虚、至交易方面亦見生色、收盤結果本月份較前月底跌四分、四月份跌五分、六月份開三兩二錢無比價、七月份跌二分、八月份初開三兩二錢二分、後跌二分云、</p>
<h3>客秈本銷轉淡</h3>
<p>閩帮辦胃轉濃　洋米售開五百包　昨日客秈到頌不旺、惟本街胃口忽淡、統市只辦六百包左右、但間帮以本銷清淡、市轉平勢、乃趁機收買江西機晚、上午在市辦成江西機晚二千多包、市面突轉活躍、繼因貨樣不合、當日退去一千多包、只有成交中關機晚一千包、價爲八元四角及二角、布與前日無大出入、本街連日暢辦後、昨日略爲停頓、共計辦去湖南機紅米一百五十包、價八元三角半、又機靖二百八十包、價七元八角至六角、南京車機秈一百六十包、價七元三角、行情亦與前市相近、惟形勢略軟弱耳、洋米外洋電訊雖有報到、但行號鑒於去年虧折、不敢問津、昨日來電一號西貢每百斤四兩零五分、與申市相似、但無成議、現貨則有洋行在米行售出一號西貢五百包、價八元半、爲本街收去、價比上月底小二角七分云、</p>
<h3>油市花生油擯賤八錢</h3>
<p>油市自改用新秤以來、市塲評價不免時起紛岐、賣買雙方、每成互擯、久之來貨堆積、致貨戶不得不贬價求售、所以昨市先售開歷輕皮生油一千二百件、夾倉生油八百件、泊兒生浦二百件、價比較前市均挫七八錢、豆油昨雖未開、後情亦作受殺之局耳、</p>
<h3>閘北貨雜路圓號盤突漲</h3>
<p>雜路桂圓、近以到貨寥寥、兼之各處地價報升、趨勢突見緊秀、昨日號方開出二百餘件、比之前盤漲起一二兩至數錢不一、此後如無意外阻碍、後市可望堅定、　以各産區函訊而論、將來新圓收成、歉、已有預敬微、故人心向上云、</p>
<h3>絲茶洋莊絲益無生氣</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊絲市、益無生氣可言、緣歐美莊鑒于海外絲市、每况愈下、日絲競銷不懈、價益趨疲、故均觀望不前、華絲商態度亦甚消極、昨日之下午期現絲均無成交、絲市前途、愈形惡劣、歐美絲銷不動、幾乏市况之足述云、</p>
<p>人造絲銷閒散</p>
<p>二月份人造絲期貨、甫于前日交解、如客帮現均忙于出運現銷、理宜清淡、加以外匯復起變化、市况閒散、昨祗本街現貨稍有進出、計絲襪帮進意德人造絲現貨十餘箱、係號帮售出、價無榮等云、</p>
<h3>生意經（十五）</h3>
<p>處處少不了的丨銅　德</p>
<p>我們用的鋼板，槍砲的子彈，和工業上以及家用的銅器，都是用　來製造的。銅有紫銅黄銅的分别</p>
<p>紫銅來自美國，有許多牌子，市上銷行的有Ｔ牌，ＦＧ牌二種。其中Ｔ牌最好，在一千分裏有九九九是純銅，一分是什質。第二ＴＧ牌、成色有九九七五。第三是ＦＣ牌了，成色只九九五。還有三星牌，這兩種牌子成色，和ＦＣ牌差不多。但是現在市上銷行　Ｔ牌和ＴＧ牌爲多。其他三種，因成色關係，銷路很少，並且缺貨時候很多。紫銅的形狀。長一尺二三寸、闊三四寸、面情浮縐，底裏有兩淺凹形，顏色赤褟色，每塊重在三十三四斤。用途造幣廠兵工廠翻砂廠及工業廠家來得最大。</p>
<p>黄銅有生熟的分别，他的形狀，長一尺二三寸，闊五六寸，厚一寸多些。面浮縐，底粗草。倘使和鋅相化合，那末色澤很鮮艶，鋼器店裏扔家用銅器，１</p>
<p>就是這種化合鋼。白銅，又呌雲白銅，他是銅鐘鎳相合而成，色白如銀，亮白的銅器，都是白銅做成。不過白銅是很貴，一般銅器店取巧，所用鋅器店取蓜民，所用鋅鎳來鍍銅，白鋼一樣，買出去當然是算白銅了。</p>
<p>銅絲，有紅黄二種，以數字代表牠的粗細。一號爲最粗，這樣順數下去，到三十六號爲最細。有美日兩種貨。外洋來貨，捲成圓卷，包着蔴布，重量有百斤和八十四斤的分别，買的時候要加工資，照粗細而定。</p>
<p>銅皮亦分紅黄二種。有厚薄的分别，也是依數字的順序下去，最厚有五分。每張長四尺，闊一尺二寸左右。德貨顏色自然，日貨色澤異常鮮艶，並且質地稍軟。每箱重二噸半。情銅皮紫銅絲和紅黄銅皮紅黄銅絲一樣，不過顏色紫色罷了，用途以電業最多，</p>
<h3>海斛與市斛引起之紛爭愕</h3>

<h3>謡言預言之類的誕生</h3>
<p>— 郁達夫</p>
<p>謡言，預言等輩的養育處，第一就須在大家貪懶不做正經事情的地方。中國的謡言，預言，所以特多的原因，就因爲中國的全國民都是閑惰不做正經事情的緣故。從在上据高位者起，一直到都市鄉村的游民乞丐爲止，中國何嘗有一個正經在拚命做事的人？謡言，預言的發生時期，總在大亂初平，或大亂繼起之後；而釀成這些謡言，預言的重大酵素，當然是在當局者的專制壓迫，與一般已被愚民政策馴服了的百姓的無智。</p>
<p>中國每當一次戰爭或天災之後，總會有許多離奇不呆思議的謡言與推背圖燒餅歌之類的預言印刷品出來。在危急多難之秋，謡言的發生，原是不得已的事情，一傳兩，兩傳三，先説是西京造反，後來就會變青菜冷飯，從一個字，變成十個字，或竟變成一件有頭有尾的故事，也很容易。俄國郭果里的巡按，愛爾闌郭萊傲里夫人的謡言的傳布兩劇，就是這一面的傳神實寫。這原是不得已的事情，但在國民智識發達，社會根基鞏固，統治者不是亂殺人亂壓迫的地方，這種現象，究竟少些。至於預言呢，那更足以證明統治者的壓迫言論的壞影響了。有識者早見到了社會破綻，但不敢明言直説，所以只好托之神意天啓，造成幻妙的預言，以廣流傳，不是某處某地掘了一塊碑、便是某村某鎭出了一個怪。預言製造者，更以能利用國民弱點，了解剌激心理的人居大多數，是以預言的内容，總側重在易朝換姓，人民大量死亡的各種事情之上。這傾向，從歷史的，社會的，民族的諸觀點研究起來，原可以成一部像Ｔhe　Golden　Bough一樣的大著的東西，在此地，我只好簡單地説，中國的預言之由來，所受的是道敎的影響，其源出於河圖洛　。降至近世，則統治者的壓迫，國民的懶惰與無智，就是造成這些無稽之談的爐灶。</p>
<p>在最近半個月中的情形之下，我倒很想起了兩件事情：第一，楊樹浦，閘北的橡膠廠爆炸，據説因爲鐵鍋是日本貨。但不知在爆炸之先，有没有人看見日本人進去放炸藥。第二，長城倒，熱河崩，不曉得有没有劉伯温的碑出來。</p>
<h3>合理化</h3>
<p>— 徒然</p>
<p>東菲洲的游牧人種麥賽族，是農耕民族的班圖族的絕對的支配者，他們對於班圖人隨便掠奪殺戳，並且還説這是［合理化］。他們説：［神把一切］的家畜賜給了麥賽人，所以飼養家畜的班圖人，應該柔順地把所有家畜獻給我們麥賽人，這樣天下就太平了。但因他們的無禮，違背神命，拒絕將家畜獻給我們，所以我們不得不殺其人而奪其家畜，］云云。</p>
<p>在麥賽族區内，還住着有狩獵民族的王道羅婆族，麥賽人雖以賤民視之，但却哀憐他們，不像對班圖族那樣的掠奪殺戳。然而試一考查這種仁慈的所以發生，實因入於游牧生活的麥賽人不吃由狩獵所獲的東西，故而對於王道羅婆族没有欺凌的必要，只把他們當作奸細使用。</p>
<p>在王道羅婆族人裏面被視爲賤民的是鐵匠。這些鐵匠們，和文明各國鐵匠一樣，是以從事製造征服異族用的武器爲職業的。麥賽人和這種鐵匠之間不通婚媾，且决不入其家，使用鐵匠製造的東西之前，必須塗油以清污穢。傳説在夜裏一説到［鐵匠］這句話，就要被獅子所襲。麥賽人殺鐵匠者無罪，若是奴隸殺了麥賽人的時候，還可以殺纔個鐵匠來補過。</p>
<p>和台灣的生蕃同樣以殺人爲名譽的麥賽人，説殺鐵匠是合理化，他們説：［神禁流人類之血，然而鐵匠是不憚瀆神而製造爲流血的武器的東西，殺這種不敬神的鐵匠，是所以安神慮。］云云。　　在去菲洲不知幾十基羅的京都所開的，呌做太平洋會議的［合理化］的會議上，中國的代表説：［日本在滿洲逞其政］治的以及領土的野心，從中國的領土内排斥中國的主權，凡事一任日本官廳横暴處置，以日本的警察管理中國人，把滿洲的門戶對中國及各國閉鎖起來，以防制赤化爲理由，駐屯大軍於滿洲，獨占滿洲鐵道，妨碍中國領土内的交通事業，以二十一條强迫中國成爲殖民地等等等等。］</p>
<p>日本代表説這都是合理化，他們説：　［滿洲的平和藉日本之力而得維持。滿］洲的經濟開發全是日本的恩賜。日本在滿洲毫無政治及領土的野心，且不欲施行此種政策。鐵路的獨占是日俄戰後的規約。然而中國不顧信義，嘗背約而以陰險的方法擅自敷設競爭線。在滿洲的日本守備隊不過七千人，惟以背面有强大之海陸軍以爲後盾，所以其威光可以維持滿洲之和平。日本爲建設今日的滿洲曾犧牲十萬生靈與二十億國帑。中國不有以自力保持自已的領土，偏要使滿洲脱離日本之手，眞是笑話之至，不堪卒聽。等等等等。［</p>
<p>［合理化］云者，並不只在西洋通用，在菲洲，在東洋都通用着。［科學超越］國境］云者，即此之謂也！</p>

<h3>星期雜記</h3>
<p>— 章克標</p>
<p>照理，星期日應得休息，什麽事也不做，早上多睡幾十分鐘，晚上也早早安眠，白天默坐在椅子上，頂好報紙也不要看，午後或者到馬路上散步一下，活活血脈，再幽閑地回寓。這一天要謝絕賓客、也不去拜訪他人，談話愈少愈好，勞動也可不必，日記毋須寫，信也不必答覆，是要一個整天的眞正休息。只有這一天是我自已的時間，只有這一天是我可以躱懶的時間，我要儘量地懒，我什麽也不想動，若是能夠臥在床上不起身，那是頂希望的，有時我竟會希望生一天小病。</p>
<p>今天，我改變了宗旨，我拿起筆來寫了，我想多少做一點工作，能夠有興致多做更好。這不是因爲别的，朝晨在床上睡夢中被爆竹驚醒，我疑心是放槍，在判明了是爆竹之後，那砲火的狂吼更加令我不安起來，我昨天看見報上説北方大戰已經經開始了，現在是我國危急存亡之秋，國難來的呼聲已經傳遍街巷了，我安能無動於中。</p>
<p>在國難期中，大家應該格外做一點工作，我相信這一句話，我决心從今天起奉行，先來寫一點星期雜記吧。因爲總是到了星期日才有工夫寫，所以呌星期難記，而且有了難記二字，便可以寫得雜雜格格，不必搭文人的架子，也不必装學者扣此臉，在我是少妝腔做勢，也就容易下筆。</p>
<p>文人的所以是文人，有些却的確就在於這妝腔做勢上，我也有時會妝腔做勢，不過近來越來越不慣了，只看我少做文章就可知道，現在想出一種不要這妝腔的雜文來試試看，或者另有路道，也未可知。况且這是爲國難而增加出來的工作，也應得自加惕勵，不要再油嘴滑舌，才合正理。</p>
<p>晨却説我朝晨在睡夢中聽得爆竹之聲，當做是施放槍砲，而在判明是爆竹之後，那北方戰事又剌激了我腦神筋，我像聽得出砲火在狂吼，於是明白了現在是國難臨頭，便立志來寫星期雜記。這是在晨間的事，所以第一着我要講到晨。</p>
<p>俗話説一年之計在於春，一日之計在於晨，大概早上空氣清新，頭腦也靈敏，所以打算起來，比較周到，把一日的事在早上估量一下，預算一下，是很對的。恕我把這計字解作打算，也許有另外更高深的别種意義，不過我覺得打算二字已夠了，而且也不十分惡劣。天下什麽事都要打算過，而且也没有人不打算，只有僞道學才要排斥打算，而事實上他還是打算的忠實信徒，不過在睡夢中是不能打算的，所以早上要起來　我要説的也只是這一句話，早上不起來的人，在他們的生活中没有晨，而都會人是大多數缺少晨的，他們的生活有點反常，平常人日間做事而他們却在夜間，比方説上海，也有不少的正式上海人要到下午才起床，而半夜裏却是他們頂活動的時間，好像他們是怕見太陽光的。</p>
<p>也不能怪他們，所有的都會人都一樣，跳舞廳，咖啡店，酒吧間，到了那時才熱閙，才有眞的情味，而都會的精髓也在這些地方。他們做了都會人，就不能不將夜作晝，而且那燈火，那光影，一切人造的樂園，也確有足以留戀的地方，那是人類戰勝自然的極端表現。　夜，是休息的時候，天不給光，但人造的燈火比太陽的光更富於誘惑性，只就燈火而説，夜間已是大可咏讚了，况且此外還有種種人造的歡樂境。從這一點看，都會人是傾向反抗自然而耽溺於人們自已的力量中，陶醉於人們自已的偉大中的人。他們只崇拜人爲的偉大而忘却了自然。（未完）</p>
<h3>黑女求神記（十五）</h3>
<p>— 肅伯訥作　宜閑譯</p>
<p>［我在這回尋求中所遇到或是聽到的神，現在有六個了；但是這中間却没有一個是我所尋］求的神·］黑女孩子説。</p>
<p>［你是在尋求神麽？］第一個先生説。［你滿意於］［孟波容汲］（註）或是你稱爲本族的神的無論什麽，豈不好呢？你不會看出我們的無論那個神比他進步來。］</p>
<p>（註）是西部亞非利加土人所敬畏的偶像</p>
<p>［我們收集着雜七夾八的不少的］［孟波容波］。第三個先生説。［我們憑良心，能够推薦給］你的，一個也没有。］</p>
<p>［這也難説的，］黑女孩子説。［但你們還是謹愼些的好罷。敎士們敎我們信你們的神。我］</p>
<p>們所得的敎訓，就不過這一點。如果我們看明白，你們並不信那些神，而且還是他們的敵人，那是我們也許要來殺你们的。我們有着幾百萬人啦；我們槍也放得同你們一樣好。　［這話有些道理呵，］那第二個先生説。［我們所不信的事情，我們怎麽可以來敎這些人。］</p>
<p>他們也許要聽信得非常用心的。爲什麽不將簡單的眞理告訴他們：説是宇宙經過着自然淘汰，神是一個寓言呢？］</p>
<p>［那就要弄得他們去信適者生存的學説了。］第一個先生疑惑着説；［而且同他們競爭起來］，我們是不是最適於生存的呢？這可是難説的。那個女孩子就是一個很好的標本。説到做這旅行團的工作呢，我們要僱用苦惱的白人，也只好不僱用了；這班土人比他們又强壯又乾净又聽明。］</p>
<p>［而且品行也好得多，］女士中間之一説。</p>
<p>［一點不錯，］第一個先生説。［所以我覺得委實還是敎他們信神的好。如果他們起了反對］歐羅巴無神思想的運動呢，那神也會使我們有反對他們的機會的。］</p>
<p>［關於宇宙的眞理，你不能敎這些人的］一個戴眼鏡的女士説。［我們現在知道，這宇宙是］</p>
<p>數學的宇宙。就敎那個女孩子用買勒思（義卽負！譯者註Ｘ的平方根來除一個數罷，她一定一點也不會懂得你的意思的，可是買勒思Ｘ的除法却是宇宙的鑰匙。］</p>
<p>［一個到處用得着的鑰匙？］那第二個先生説。［在我看來，買勒思Ｘ的平方根是無謂的。］自然淘汰呢。！！］</p>
<p>［這一切有什麽用處呢？］一個頽唐的先生呻呼了。［我們確實知道的那一件事是，太陽正］</p>
<p>在散失他的熱，我們不久是要凍死的。在這個事實的前面，還有什麽要緊呢？］</p>
<p>［高興些罷，克洛凱爾先生，］一個活潑的年青的先生説。［我做着本團的物理學者主任（註）］</p>
<p>）能够。告知你一個道理，使你相信：除非你排斥宇宙放熱這一個無疑的事實，那你就有同樣充分的理由，相信太陽逐漸加熱起來，終究要將我們都活燒死的。］</p>
<p>（註）在原文上，和［主任醫生］這名稱，相差只有兩個字母。</p>

<h3>日本人所見退出國聯以後的結果（日本通信）</h3>
<p>日本之所謂［國論］誰都知道是軍部指揮之下的日本國的［國論］這和操塲上的動作差不多相似、但决不是人民意志的表現、而是極少數的軍國主義者、用兵力和恐怖（暗殺手段）等等、逼出來的現象、不過也間或有眞是忠於日本而具有目光的論調、現在把國聯十九委員會提出報告書草案以來、日本的輿論分作兩大類、第一類是完全贊成軍部的侵略行爲、或曲意奉承軍部行爲的、第二類是有反對的意識而不敢公然表白、即使寫成文章、也不能完全刊布的、這兩類中、第一類所包含的是各大新聞、各大雜誌、和軍部所指揮之下的日本政府、第二類是在野的著作家、政治家和革命黨人、第一類之中、説去説來總是同樣的舊套、（一）説國聯對東方問題的認識不足、（二）説中國的紛亂、（三）説防備［赤化］（四）説日本對［滿洲］用兵是［自衛權］的發動、（五）説維持［滿洲］（傀儡）國］就是維持東亞和平、</p>
<p>大阪朝日有句話更可笑、牠説、［十三年］來日本是國聯的忠實盟員、對非戰公約及九國公約尤具神聖的信仰……但中國例外的事態、要把各條約的原則與現實重加考慮］不過牠對於日本退出國聯則主張愼重、</p>
<p>可是東京日日新聞就不同了、牠以爲［孤］立無援、自主獨往是光榮的］牠曉得國聯的空氣於日本極端不利、在大會的時候、除了日本以外都一齊要投贊成十九委員會報告書的票、牠還是以爲日本該退出國聯、照牠的旣定方針—扶助滿洲國進攻熱河—一力猛進、同時牠又向國聯誇説是、［世界大戰的時候、日本所持的是］利他主義、當時戰爭雖然是以歐洲爲中心、但是如果没有日本的援助、聯合國到底得不到大勝利的、誠然美國的參戰給聯合國以大勝的决定機會、如果日本不參加戰爭、則美國决不能參戰……］這一節話隱隱中表白日本在太平洋的霸權、頗含得有挑戰的意味、</p>
<p>讀賣新聞説、［……元來滿洲問題的起因是］没有國聯資格而又不是統一國家的中國在滿洲有統治權、纔惹亂子來的……現在日本是東洋民族與中國地域相接、這是（日本）的生死重大問題、如若處置錯誤的話、眞是會像（内田所説）化全（日本））國爲焦土、……所以日本不能接受國聯的勸告、退出國聯乃屬必然之事、……］旣然牠們都認爲該退出國聯是必不可免的事、然則牠於外交上、經濟上是否毫無顧忌呢、據山川端夫（加藤高明内閣時代）的法制局長、現爲貴族院議員）他的答案是、</p>
<p>［前年十月國聯行政會以十三票對一票］的議案、和去年三月國聯大會、日本放棄表决權所成立的議决案、最近十九國委員會的草案、通世界與論、莫不議日本之非、在平常的時候、日本該考慮世界輿論、然世界輿論錯誤、日本即無加以考慮之必要、……］所以適用盟約第十五條第四項、我（日本）毫無所懼、反可借此使國聯了解東洋之事態……］</p>
<p>又如藤原銀次郎（與三井關係極深、王子）製社社長、現任貴族院議員、）他對於日本退出國聯之後、如果惹出嚴重反響、引動列國對日實行經濟封鎖的話、則日本又將何如、他的意見以爲、</p>
<p>［……美國各對日本的生絲課以重税（演出）］半封鎖的經濟狀態、）歐洲對日本出産的綿布、綿製物品、人造絲、以及其他雜貨也課以重税、是否即足以圍困日本、如果實現時、日本亦可對美綿課以重税、而加力報復、對歐洲亦然、……［至於完全經］濟封鎖、除非像歐戰當時、各國對德國那樣極度惡化之外、則僅爲一種理論上之好聽名詞、在勢很難於實行……、］</p>
<p>［……再則中國若是長遠的妨害日本貿易、］各國也援助中國的話、日本就可以由青島到天津、—把揚子江以北—所謂北中國各地劃作日本的勢力範圍、來開拓商務、把從前在上海的貿易搬到青島去、失掉了南方、却拿北方來補、不用客氣、在天津、北平、山東省要採取自由行動、取自衛手段、將來恐怕會比現在的中國出産還要增加起來、……］</p>
<p>茂木　兵衛）是後起的實業家）、他對於這回滿洲事變、特辊是退出國聯的事、有如下的見解、</p>
<p>［……滿洲國的前途如何、不欲加以論列、］……惟帝國主義的政策、現已完全失敗新興之日本果蹈其覆轍、則於日本外交、究竟是有損呢、是有益呢、也就不用多講了、</p>
<p>［日本將來的外交政策有兩途、一個是國］</p>
<p>際主義的政策、其他一個是帝國主義的大陸政策、日本當然要用其中之一來確定牠的經濟政策、曾經一度發展的歐美帝國主義、至於今日正要清算的時候、日本可否採取這種方針、是値得考慮的、日本如果勉强要掌握東洋霸權、而採取東亞門羅主義、結果恐怕把握東洋霸權將不可能、北美合衆國、勞農俄羅斯都在國聯圈外據有力的地位、日本對牠們没有什麽畏懼、可是日本當前的問題是中國問題、……］</p>
<p>［……日本退出國際聯盟之後、是否就能自］由行使其［大陸政策］呢、退出國聯、假如遇着經濟封鎖、統治權且把牠當作另一問題、日本在世界上的地位、也會遇着比從前更困難的立塲、……况且經濟上講到國際的關係、日本的經濟問題不用和平的方法、則完全没有解决的希望、……］［假若日本與某一國開戰的話、則全世界］都會是日本的敵人、縱令軍事上一時的勝利、也不足爲國家之光榮、世界大戰就是實際敎訓很好的例子、也不外是先進的德意志帝國挑起大戰所得同樣的結果、况且近代戰爭是以經濟力來决定最後的勝利、日本的經濟力到底有多大的力量、早經有識者的研究和討論、是否有與全世界爲敵的自信呢、……德意志帝國的瓦解、……雖然大資本家會謳歌戰爭、誘導戰爭、但是要曉得須顧世界情勢的現在、戰爭却是會招來他們自已的破綻、……］</p>
<p>荒田寒村由無政府主義者轉成［鮑爾塞］維克］、近來很有法西斯蒂傾向、可是他的見解雖不高明、却可以代表右傾當中時急進思想、他以爲、</p>
<p>［……破棄國際協調、而甘心孤立的外交方］針、即資本階級也是不願如此、只有軍部纔力主退出國聯、……軍部所以會這樣强硬的原因、是軍閥歷來的傳統政策、毫無足怪、……日本如退出國聯、則反給美國與國聯密接的機緣、况且國聯之發起是民主黨故總统威爾遜創意的、恐怕今後、將再提美國加入國聯的問題亦未可知、……</p>
<p>［於是乎、日本的久交、遂完全孤立化、像］歐洲大戰以前的德意志一樣、今後將以美國爲中心張開對日的包圍綫、］……</p>
<p>長谷川如是閒歷來保持着批評家的態度、他更以爲（日本）是盲目的衝動、［資本］主義末期的國家要克服本能與理性間的矛看、其可能性是很少的、］……</p>
<p>［……（日本一般人）一方面要支持其特殊］的大陸政策、他方面因爲這種政策致陷日本國家財政於危境、這是財政專門家和一般新聞都承認的、……也是不能隱諱的事實、］……</p>

<h3>外交委員長伍朝樞氏重要談話</h3>
<p>英禁運軍火不公我應抗議</p>
<p>主召回駐日使並準備絕交</p>
<p>俄使俟晤顏惠慶後即來華</p>
<p>日僞私訂一切條約均無效</p>
<p>外交委員會委員長伍朝樞氏、於今晨由京返滬、記者特往訪伍氏於其寓邸、詢以英國對中日同行禁運軍火問題、及對日斷絕國交之意見、當亟詳爲答復如下、</p>
<h3>禁運軍火問題</h3>
<p>據伍氏談、英國對中日兩國同行禁運火、表面上似對雙方不作左右袒、實則不然、蓋因日本非但有鉅額之軍火積儲、且能自已製造、中國則反是、且毫無存儲、不得不向他國購買、並聞日本最近曾向英國訂購大批軍火、此又因定貨在前、不在禁運之列、是故英國對中日兩國同行禁運軍火、不啻懲罰無罪之國、而協助侵略之國、日本爲侵略國、我國爲被侵略國、日本爲有罪者、中國爲無罪者、此爲國聯已判定之事實、英國不單獨對日禁運軍火、而對中日同行禁運、實太不公平、目前我國唯有向英國提出異議、依據公理力爭耳、</p>
<h3>主張召回公使</h3>
<p>伍氏繼談、對日斷絕國交問題、伍氏之言曰、在談及此項問題之前、我人必須先認識斷絕國交·與召回公使·爲兩事、斷絕國交當然召回公使、但召回公使、未必即爲斷絕國交、日本旣積極對華侵略、當然已無外交折衝之可言、且爲我國人格計、本人主張我國應立即召回駐日公使、同時並準備對日斷絕國交、蓋因斷絕國交爲一重大問題、事前不得不有準備也、</p>
<h3>國聯實力制裁</h3>
<p>國聯自通過十九國特委會所草擬之報告書後、究將採取何種行動、實力制裁乎、抑空言搪塞乎、此爲一全世界人士所注意之謎、記者特以此探詢伍氏之意見、伍氏答稱、國聯自身毫無實力、國聯之實力、即會員國之實力耳、國聯究竟能否以實力制裁日本、須視國聯各會員國有無此决心爲斷、尤須視與遠東有關之各會員國有無此决心爲斷、</p>
<h3>俄使即將來華</h3>
<p>伍氏繼語記者曰、國聯邀請美俄參加顧問委員會、蘇俄究將應邀參加乎、在目前尚無人能以置答、今日報載蘇俄對參加顧問委員會附有條件二則、一爲須美國同時參加、一爲須美國承認蘇俄、如此説果確、則第一項似有把握、第二項亦有希望、蘇俄將應邀參加國聯顧問委員會、已屬可能之事矣、至於蘇俄駐華大使鮑格莫洛夫須待與我顏大使在莫斯科會面之後、再行啓程來華、顏氏於今明日即可抵莫斯科、則俄使來華之期、亦已不在遠矣、</p>
<h3>日僞訂約無效</h3>
<p>旋記者以南滿鐵路公司與僞組織訂立合同、將東北鐵路完全委託滿鐵管理之問題、詢諸伍氏、伍氏斷然謂記者曰、日僞所訂之一切條約、除日僞私下關係外、在國際間當然絕對無效、</p>
<h3>熱河戰事順利</h3>
<p>記者於辭出之際、又以熱河之戰况詢諸伍氏、據談本人在京時所得之消息、熱河戰事、異常順利、將士均能用命、宋代院長及李恊和（烈鉤）先生最近將赴平一行、本人此後仍留滬上、惟於外交委員會開會時赴京出席、</p>
<h3>宋子文今晨抵滬</h3>

<p>代理行政院長宋子文氏、偕秘書黄純道今晨六時由京乘福時機來滬、八時半駛抵虹橋飛機塲、當即返邸休息、十時許、中央造幣廠長郭承恩奉召往謁、報告該廠開鑄新幣情形、</p>
<h3>兩路員司籌十五萬元購兩路號機</h3>
<p>丨組織兩路空防籌委會丨</p>
<p>京滬滬杭甬兩路員司、鑒於外侮日亟、航空救國、爲目前當務之急、爰組織京滬滬杭甬空防籌備委員會、當於日昨舉行第一次會、通過組織章程、並推出陳承拭·李達之·袁伯揚·三君爲執行委員兼常務委員、鄒政堅·閔羅鈵·袁紹昌·何永元·鍾桂丹·鴻其昌·陳福海·等分任執監委員、至捐機辦法、除月捐外、擬另籌十五萬元、購買一兩路號飛機、</p>
<h3>北洋商運全無華輪停航天津</h3>
<p>自日海軍封鎖白河海口之消息傳布後、天津客帮、均相率停止辦貨、而日海軍省又藉口于學忠在大沽外將自沉商輪、阻斷航道、故佐世保特派軍艦一隊、開往華北、明日可到青島、形勢更爲嚴重、本埠各華輪公司、因天津已無貨運、而情勢又復吃緊、今日磋商停航北洋路綫、招商局方面、决定遇順輪此次開赴天津外、下班如無去貨、决計暫停開往、其餘之臨時北洋輪、亦一律停航、</p>

<h3>工廠應有安全設備</h3>
<p>— 人</p>
<p>日前塘山路正泰橡膠廠，因馬達線走電，而汽缸爆裂，頃間百餘人於烈燄熊熊中慘呼狂吼而死！據報載，全廠二百七十餘工人中，只百人拼命逃出，餘盡葬身火窟，不數日永和公司蒸缸亦爆炸，死傷男女四十餘人，燬工房十七間，數日之間，機器間發生慘案兩起，其况之慘，正與四年前閘北軍衣廠失火焚斃數百人之事相等。</p>
<p>處在今日的機器工業時代的工廠，在廠工人隨時隨地都有性命的危險，廠方在平日對於安全設施就應當有充分與完全的準備及訓練，才不致有事變發生，即發生亦不致有如是之慘，一斃就是數百人！此次不幸之慘變，固出於偶然與倉卒，非人事所能預料，永和情形尚不及知，然據熟悉正泰廠内幕情形者談，該廠房屋本不合工廠建築，而於安全設備，尤屬漠視，且平時穿皆緊閉（這）一點，殊莫測其用意之高深也！）臨難，工人們不但不得仰賴設備以自救，亦且走頭無出而同淪於火堆！這在直接負有全廠責任的當局，是無以對此次死難工人及社會人士的。</p>
<p>憑良心説，一天做到晚，尚不能得肚子充實的工人，福利談不到，還要準備拿性命去枉送掉，這如何説得過去？所以，在本市社會局開始調查全市工廠時，請嚴厲執行工廠法第四十一·二兩條，特别注意工廠中之安全設備，並取締不問工人福利，而僅盡其剝削壓榨之能事以取得利益之工廠，這画點，在此次受正泰廠的大敎訓之後，我們還應當因循視忽嗎？</p>

<h3>尼安燈</h3>
<p>— 阿唐</p>
<p>「尼安燈」在上海是很普遍了，差不多每家戲院和較大的商店和酒館都有尼安燈的裝置，並且在描寫霞飛路的文藝作品裏，尼安燈也佔有很重要的地位，現在就談尼安燈的構造和原理，</p>
<p>有許多氣體，被封入眞空的玻璃管内再通以電流以後，全管就發出光亮，光的顏色，因隨着氣體的種類而異，譬如管内是二養化碳，那就發出白光，而尼安燈也是根據這個原理而造成的。　　在大氣中舍有一種遊離狀態的氣體，呌做氖，（Ｎeon）譯音就是［尼安］，它是一種無色無臭的氣體，不易和别的元素化合，並且數量極少，僅佔大氣體積的十萬分之一或二，這就是尼安燈的原料。</p>
<p>現在要講尼安燈的構造了，把直徑十五粍（一粍合千分之一米突）的玻璃管，屈成種種圖畫和文字，各字相連的地方，用黑漆塗上，兩端封入兩個金屬的電極，再用抽氣器抽成高度的眞空，灌入少許的氖，兩極上施以五千至一萬弗的電壓，就由放電而發出紅光，這就是市上的尼安燈了，但是市上的尼安燈，並非完全是紅色的，管内加少許水銀蒸氣，就放青色；如玻璃管用黄色，就成綠色；如果管内發的光是紅色而管用黄色，就成橙色，所以尼安燈可用種種方法成種種不同的顏色。</p>

<h3>Major Battle Near Chifeng Begins</h3>
<p>Japanese Troops Concentrate at Fang Shen from Xiawa, East of Sui</p>
<p>Sun Dianying's Troops All Arrive at Chifeng to Establish Defense</p>
<p>Shi Brigade Already Engaged in Fierce Battle with Enemy Vanguard</p>
<p>(Beiping) Chengde Telegram: Japanese troops, including the Kuroda and Motegi units coming from Kailu, arrived at Fang Shen yesterday morning, numbering about three thousand. In the evening, another three thousand arrived continuously, traveling by car from places like Sui Dong and Xiawa, and concentrated at places like Fang Shen, Xiao Hala, and Xiaohe Yan. At one o'clock this morning, they launched an attack on our Chifeng. A major battle near Yi Feng has already begun. Our troops have built strong fortifications in Chifeng. Sun Dianying's entire force has arrived at Chifeng. Our main force has been fully equipped, and a decisive battle is expected tonight. Our reinforcements are continuing to arrive, so there is no concern for Chifeng. (1st Day Special Dispatch) (Beiping) According to Chinese sources, the Japanese troops who departed from Kailu are still advancing towards Chifeng. The Japanese troops seem to have advanced to Fang Shen, where they are reorganizing and preparing to attack Chifeng. Currently, the defenders of Chifeng are Sun Dianying's troops, numbering 30,000, who are entrenched in the deep forests on the outer slopes of Chifeng, with a favorable terrain. It is anticipated that the army will attack the outer positions of Chifeng tomorrow night. Motegi's cavalry has now joined the Matsuda detachment. This route will be the first time the Japanese army engages with formal Chinese troops in Chifeng. It is widely expected that the Chinese army in Chifeng will resist as fiercely as the Chinese troops in southern Rehe. Japanese planes are still very active behind the Chinese army's positions. (1st Day Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Japanese propaganda claims the Motegi Brigade has arrived near Chifeng.

North of Baishizui is Heishakou, which is guarded by the 19th Brigade, with very clever defenses. Japanese planes cannot detect the brigade's location. A large Japanese cavalry unit attempted to pass through the pass, but was met with machine gun and rifle fire. After several hours of fierce fighting, the Japanese cavalry was defeated and retreated to their base.

Yesterday, there was no movement from either infantry or cavalry all day. (1st Day Reuters Telegram)</p>

<h3>The 〇〇 Plane of Lieutenant Kuboki of the Japanese Army in Jinzhou</h3>

Brigade Commander Sun Dequan told foreign reporters that enemy artillery fire is not to be feared, and soldiers are accustomed to enemy aircraft, which are even less intimidating. The most terrifying weapon in modern warfare is the hot blood of soldiers. Our soldiers are willing to use their hot blood to resist the powerful enemy. When the enemy comes, we will charge and fight to the death. Although artillery and aircraft are very fierce, they are ineffective. The morale of the front-line soldiers is extremely high.

<h3>British Ban on Arms Supply to China and Japan</h3>
<p>The British government, in order to reduce the risk of expanding and prolonging the bloodshed of the Sino-Japanese conflict, decided on the 27th of last month to reiterate the 1931 ban on arms exports and implement an arms embargo on Japan and China. At the same time, it is contacting other countries, hoping to establish a common agreement by all countries. The British government's decision is motivated by a desire for peace and to end the scourge of war. Such a noble morality and enthusiasm for human endeavor are sincerely admired by us.</p>
<p>However, can the British government's move truly achieve its noblest hopes? In other words, is an arms embargo on China and Japan sufficient to curb Japan's aggression and end the war in the Far East? Moreover, is the British government's move truly a fair approach? We cannot help but have some doubts about this.</p>
<p>British Foreign Secretary Simon reported to Parliament on the 27th of last month, saying, "The Japanese military's incursion is a violation of the League of Nations Covenant. Japan's unilateral action is not permitted by the League of Nations Covenant. There is no doubt that Japan's actions are not in accordance with the Covenant." If it is certain that Japan has violated the League of Nations Covenant, then in order to maintain the dignity of the League of Nations Covenant and to uphold justice and peace, the British government should take more active and effective measures to stop Japan's aggression. If merely focusing on the arms embargo is too passive and slow, it would only expose the weakness and incompetence of the League of Nations.</p>
<p>Moreover, the current war between China and Japan is an act of aggression by Japan, while it is an act of self-defense by our country. The difference in meaning between aggression and self-defense is worlds apart. Even if the British government truly believes that an arms embargo is an effective way to end the war in the Far East, it should only be applied to Japan, which is in a position of aggression, and should not be applied equally to China, which is in a position of being invaded. Japan wants to obtain arms from other countries to invade China, while China only wants to obtain arms from other countries for self-defense, not to invade others. If the British government's decision is made without recognizing the meaning of aggression and self-defense, and it fails to uphold justice in the pursuit of peace, but instead sacrifices justice for peace, wouldn't that be a mistake?</p>
<p>Furthermore, Japan's industry is developed, and it has the equipment to manufacture arms domestically. Its need for arms is not as great as that of our country, and it can also purchase arms from a certain country that deliberately abstained from the League of Nations Assembly and is not bound by the embargo. As for our country, it is undeniable that most of the so-called modern weapons rely on imports. Now that the British government has uniformly banned the supply of arms, its impact on Japan's aggressive behavior is minimal, while its impact on our country's self-defense behavior is enormous. The result in fact would be tantamount to helping Japan's violence and reducing our country's strength to defend itself. Is this kind of result also something that the British government did not originally intend?</p>
<p>Therefore, on the one hand, we feel that the British government's decision is motivated by a very noble purpose, but on the other hand, we especially hope that the British government can deliberate deeply and change this passive policy, and adopt a more active and effective approach. Otherwise, "this kind of ban will have no effect."</p>
<p>It's just a very expensive gesture." The Morning Post of the United Kingdom has already said this before us. What else can we say?</p>
<p>However, the people of the country should correctly grasp the lessons that this matter has given us. First, in this era of storms and rain, a country that wants to survive freely must have a substantial national defense. To build a substantial national defense, we must pay attention to the equipment of the military industry. If we only rely on others, the source will be cut off, and we will only be able to wait for people to attack and have no way to fight. The past is irretrievable. From now on, we should urgently seek ways to remedy it. Second, Matsuoka said to a reporter from the Paris Times in Paris on the 28th of last month that "if various countries supply China with a large amount of arms, it will only supply Chinese soldiers with mutual killing."</p>
<p>It is not seen that it can be used to resist Japan." Although his words are extremely unreasonable, they are enough to make us pay attention. Chinese soldiers should have a fundamental understanding of this. To this day, we can only unite firmly and use our flesh and blood to resist insult. What else is there to say?</p>
<h3>Japanese Plan to Disrupt North China after Failure to Invade Rehe</h3>
<h3>Aircraft Carrier with 26 Planes and Other Warships Arrive at Qinhuangdao</h3>
<p>If Japan Provokes Incidents in North China, the Situation Will Further Escalate</p>
<p>Yu Xuezhong Expresses Readiness for a Decisive Battle with the Enemy if Necessary</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese military issued a statement, threatening that if the Chinese troops resisting in Rehe continue to resist, it will extend to North China, etc. At the same time, rumors in Qinhuangdao say that the Japanese aircraft carrier Ryujo, carrying 26 aircraft, has arrived off the coast of Qinhuangdao from Lushun. According to a certain important person, foreigners are also surprised by this matter. If the Japanese cause trouble in North China, the situation will further escalate. We are fully prepared, and if the enemy dares to try in Tianjin and Beiping, we will resolutely deal with it with all our strength. (1st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) More than 500 Japanese soldiers stationed in Tianjin conducted snow combat exercises outside the railway at the General Station from morning to noon on the 1st. There was heavy gunfire for a while, causing considerable anxiety among the residents. (1st Dispatch) (Beiping) Qinhuangdao Dispatch: A total of ten Japanese warships have arrived at Qinhuangdao port in recent days. Seven of them are warships, and three are constantly shuttling for transport. It is rumored that the aircraft carrier Ryujo stationed in Lushun will come to Qinhuangdao, but it has not arrived yet. (1st Dispatch) (Beiping) Qinhuangdao Dispatch: Due to the continuous arrival of Japanese warships, the threat is severe, and rumors are rampant in Qinhuangdao. Residents are moving to the Kailuan mining area for refuge, and many shops are not open. The front line at the Shi River is also tense. (1st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yu Xuezhong stated that if the Japanese dare to cause trouble, he will mobilize more than 30,000 troops under his command to Tianjin in two or three hours and fight the enemy to the death, resolutely not allowing the enemy to be rampant. Furthermore, the Japanese instigated countries such as Britain and the United States to protest to us to uphold the Boxer Protocol, but all countries declined. (1st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) It is confirmed that Japan's newest and fastest aircraft carrier, the Showa, recently sailed from Lushun and is now cruising with other Japanese warships off Qinhuangdao. The Showa has a displacement of 7,000 tons and carries 26 aircraft. The public has long expected that if Japan launches an air war against the Tianjin-Beiping area, its aircraft will definitely take off from aircraft carriers. Now that the ship has appeared off Qinhuangdao, people are very uneasy. The other warships include two cruisers, one mine-laying ship, and six destroyers. (1st Reuters Dispatch) (Tianjin) Eight enemy ships are at Qinhuangdao, and one or two of them occasionally scouted the Beidaihe and Luan River estuary. On the morning of the 1st, all of them approached the Shi River coast, with each ship four or five li apart, head east and tail west, flying battle flags, creating a serious situation. The combat preparations of the Japanese troops stationed in Tianjin have become acute. Around the city, the lights suddenly went out on the night of the 28th, and the Public Security Bureau immediately stepped up security. It was later found that the power transfer station was damaged. (1st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A dispatch from Qinhuangdao at 5:00 AM on the 1st stated that the local situation is extremely tense. It is rumored that the Showa aircraft carrier has arrived here with 26 aircraft from Lushun, but it has not been confirmed after investigation. (1st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese Consul-General protested to the Provincial Government against the fortification of Dagu, saying it was inconsistent with the Boxer Protocol. Chairman Yu replied that all treaties should be observed by both parties. If one party has already disregarded it and forces the other party to comply, it is not tolerated by common sense. Barbed wire fences are set up everywhere in the Japanese concession, but they demand that we protect the lives and property of Japanese residents, a situation no different from the previous Tianjin Incident. However, we are fully prepared and will be able to cope with it easily. (1st Morning Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Sun Ke Says Japanese Invasion of Rehe Is No Different from A Tiger Relying on the River Without Thought</h3>
<p>The Central Government Has a Complete and Substantial Plan to Deal with the Crisis in North China</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Sun Ke said that after the League of Nations passed the report and sent it to the United States and Russia, the Japanese felt isolated and could not save the current situation unless they relied on force to create a new situation. Therefore, Japan has been fiercely invading Rehe, no different from a tiger relying on the river without thought. If not, it would not be enough to demonstrate to the League of Nations externally and encourage the people internally. Therefore, our country's resistance this time is a battle of life and death for both China and Japan. Observing that the Japanese, from top to bottom, also use the national crisis as a slogan, the importance of the situation is more than half thought. If the aggressor country is like this, what should the invaded country do? The League of Nations, the United States, and Russia all have the same desire to sanction Japan, but each country has different environments, starting points, and altruistic hearts, and it is difficult to reach a consensus. As the ancient saying goes, "Rescue people from a well." Now, if you haven't gone down the well yourself, but you want people to rescue you first, is there any reason in the world? If you want to know how much international help we will get in the future, you should think about how our country can save itself. As for the information the central government has received in recent days and what is published in the newspapers, there is generally no difference. However, the conflicts in the previous few days were reconnaissance battles, and the main battle began on the 27th. In order to facilitate replenishment and obtain a view of the terrain, we have changed our battle lines, but it is not a defeat. Japan's war tools are far superior to ours, but the morale of our side is also not enough to deter the enemy. The Central Government has a complete and substantial plan to deal with the crisis in North China, but it is not convenient to announce it because it involves military secrets. The UK's arms embargo proposal is inappropriate because since the League of Nations has recognized Japan as the aggressor, all treatments should not be mentioned in the same breath. Analyzing its meaning, it is clearly contrary to the spirit of Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant. The aggressor country should be sanctioned, and the invaded country should receive assistance from allied countries in both passive and active ways. The UK, as one of the allied countries, is naturally no exception. (1st Dispatch)</p>

<h3>International Action Brewing on Arms Embargo Against Japan</h3>
<p>Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs Raises Objections to the British Government's Embargo</p>
<p>Simon Indicates That Unified Action Will Be Taken After International Agreement</p>
<p>The League of Nations Administrative Council Inquires About the Attitudes of Various Countries</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to reports, the British government has decided to prohibit the export of arms to both China and Japan, treating the aggressor and the aggressed equally, which is extremely unfair. A certain important person in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued the following statement regarding this matter: Japan has invaded Northeast China for more than a year. Initially, various countries excused themselves that the truth was unclear and were unwilling to take active actions. Later, after the report of the Lytton Investigation Team and the recently passed report of the League of Nations General Assembly, the right and wrong were clearly revealed to the world. It is undoubtedly true that Japan is the aggressor and we are the aggressed. However, Japan still does not regret its mistakes and actively invades Rehe. According to the report of the League of Nations General Assembly and the spirit of the League of Nations Covenant, various countries should actively sanction Japan, and at the very least, they should refuse to supply Japan with tools for fighting against us. However, the recent decision of the British government to prohibit the export of arms to both China and Japan is not only failing to treat the aggressor and the aggressed differently, but also suspected of assisting Japan. Japan's military equipment is sufficient, while our country mostly relies on foreigners. The actual result of prohibiting arms exports is that China alone suffers disadvantages, while Japan can complete its invasion of Rehe in an even shorter period of time. This is truly inconsistent with the spirit of the League of Nations Covenant and the report of the League of Nations General Assembly, and especially violates the provision in the General Assembly report that ["The League of Nations member states' passing of this report is intended to curb any action that is close to hindering"] or delaying the implementation of the recommendations of this report"], which is deeply regrettable.

<h3>Sino-British Negotiations</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The embargo on arms to warring countries was first proposed by the United States. Hoover once asked Congress to authorize the President to consider this matter. Our government instructed the embassy in the United States to convey the government's opinions. The United States has not yet made a concrete decision. Recently, the UK has decided to implement an embargo, treating China and Japan equally. A certain official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has issued a statement on this matter. It is reported that on the 28th, the embassy in the UK was ordered to raise objections to the UK. Councilor Chen Weicheng met with Simon to state our government's opinions. Simon replied that this decision of the British government is temporary. Although the responsibility for the Sino-Japanese dispute has been determined by the League of Nations, it is difficult for the British government to unilaterally decide to prohibit the export of arms to Japan. In the future, if there is a unified international decision to prohibit the export of arms to Japan, the British government will also take unified action. It is now believed that if the international agreement on an arms embargo is chaired by the League of Nations, it will definitely achieve the satisfactory result of only prohibiting exports to Japan. (1st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Chen Weicheng, the Chinese representative to the UK, discussed the arms embargo incident with Foreign Minister Simon today. They exchanged views on the current situation in Rehe and the relationship between China and Britain, especially on issues such as the three northeastern provinces. However, China has not yet lodged a protest with Britain regarding the arms embargo. (28th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>International Action</h3>
<p>(Geneva) At today's meeting of the League of Nations Administrative Council, the Chinese representative Gu Weijun stated that China supports the proposal of France and Britain to prohibit the export of arms to both Bolivia and Paraguay in South America, because it has not yet been determined which country is the aggressor. If the League of Nations wants to recommend prohibiting the export of arms to China, China will firmly protest. The aggressor in the Far East has been clearly determined. Subsequently, the Administrative Council first approved in principle the prohibition of arms exports to both Bolivia and Paraguay. After inquiring whether various member states are willing to join the embargo, a concrete decision will be made. It is now expected that the United States will also be consulted in this matter, because the US government has repeatedly used this power to prohibit arms exports to South American countries based on resolutions passed by Congress. (28th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Administrative Council held a closed-door meeting tonight to consider the British proposal to prohibit arms supplies to Paraguay and Bolivia in South America. The Japanese representative did not attend. Gu Weijun represented China at the meeting. After a brief discussion by the members of the Administrative Council, it was decided that each would consult their respective governments. Dr. Gu did not mention the situation in the Far East, but said that it should be determined which country is the aggressor between Paraguay and Bolivia. Now the League of Nations has not made a ruling on both sides, so he is prepared to support the prohibition proposed by Britain, but if the case is different, he will inevitably propose a reservation. The Administrative Council then elected a drafting committee to prepare a resolution to be submitted to various countries. (28th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Today, after the meeting of the League of Nations Administrative Council, the Chinese representative Yan Huiqing issued a statement to the press, stating that the UK's simultaneous arms embargo on China and Japan is unfair, unjust, inconsistent with the League of Nations resolutions, and unreasonable, because in the Sino-Japanese dispute, which is unreasonable and which is the aggressor has long been clearly determined. This move by the British actually only helps Japan, because Japan already has a huge accumulation of arms and can manufacture them itself, while China has virtually no storage in practice and cannot but buy from other countries. (Washington) Today, the US Senate raised the issue of an arms embargo on China or Japan and discussed it briefly. Generally, senators believe that no concrete action can be taken during this session, because although the United States has repeatedly used this power to suppress revolutions in South America, previous presidents' use of this power has caused heated debates, and today some senators argue that Congress cannot agree to expand this power to areas outside the scope of the Monroe Doctrine. Senator Hamilton declared today that whether an arms embargo is implemented against Japan or China, conflicts may occur in the Philippines, because if one country is offended by the arms embargo, the Philippines may be attacked. Even the Soviet Union may be offended by this, because the Soviet Union and the prohibited country will have a sense of sympathy regarding the arms embargo issue. In addition, most senators do not want to consider the arms embargo issue because there are still a large number of unfinished cases in both houses that need to be completed urgently. There are only three days left in this session, and there are still more than 100 cases that must be voted on, especially those related to the budget are the most urgent. (28th National Telegram)</p>
<p>According to a certain official in Ottawa, the Canadian government will definitely follow the British government and prohibit the transportation of arms and ammunition to China and Japan. No formal action has yet been taken, but Canada has not actually manufactured war materials or transported them for export in recent years. However, the nickel transported to Japan is quite a lot, especially last year. This material can be used to make weapons. Whether it should be banned in the future is a problem. (1st Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>According to well-informed sources in Prague, the Czechoslovakian government has rejected the British government's proposal to prohibit the export of arms to the Far East. It is said that the Skoda arms factory is now managed by a certain French arms factory and is manufacturing large quantities of arms day and night to meet the needs of the Far East, and Japan has purchased a particularly large amount. (1st National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Airplane Issues</h3>
<p>(London) As a result of the British government's decision to prohibit the transport of arms to warring countries in the Far East, the 1931 Prohibition of Arms Export Order will be implemented. All assembled or disassembled aircraft and engines, whether civilian or military, are included in the prohibition of export. Officials explained that the reason why all types of aircraft are listed in one amount is that it is difficult to distinguish which aircraft are for peaceful use and which are for war. (28th China Press Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Today, British aircraft manufacturers surrounded the Department of Commerce all day, protesting the inclusion of civilian aircraft in the arms category and the simultaneous embargo on the Far East. It is now expected that after this protest, the British Foreign Secretary will soon announce a change to the embargo items, excluding civilian aircraft, because the UK's arms embargo on the Far East this time is actually reimposing the 1931 Arms Export Embargo Order. At that time, the UK had a plane embargo agreement with Abyssinia, and the UK was not allowed to transport planes to that country, so assembled and disassembled civilian aircraft were also included in the embargo.

<h3>Japan Decides to Continue Participating in the Disarmament Conference</h3>
<p>Withdrawal from the League of Nations Remains a Mystery</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Japanese delegation to the Disarmament Conference has received instructions from Tokyo to stay in Geneva and continue to participate in the work of the Disarmament Conference. (1st Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Ambassadors Matsudaira and Sato, representatives to the Disarmament Conference, left at 10:40 PM last night to return to their respective posts. Because the army representative had decided to withdraw, they were all eager to prepare their luggage. Only the naval side will remain temporarily and not withdraw. (1st Electric Communication Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japan's notification of withdrawal from the League of Nations will be consulted with the Privy Council around the 11th. The Privy Council is studying the measures, but the special investigation committee is quite doubtful about the external policy after withdrawal. However, the result is likely to be that the government's policy will be recognized, and the Privy Council believes that the empire's diplomacy after withdrawal should shift from League of Nations doctrine to the establishment of a flexible foreign policy. Therefore, there are doubts as to whether the current organization of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is applicable. The investigation department, which was suspended midway through the deliberation last year, may be expanded and given authority. Therefore, the necessity of refreshing diplomacy and researching and investigating new policies has emerged, and the government has also considered it. Therefore, the decision to withdraw and the problem of the investigation department are likely to reignite. ] (1st Electric Communication Telegram)</p>
<h3>Rumor of Soviet Russia's Conditional Participation in the League of Nations Advisory Committee</h3>
<p>Simultaneous Participation with the United States and US Recognition of Soviet Russia</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to diplomatic sources, the League of Nations previously invited the United States and Russia to participate in the Advisory Committee. The United States has formally announced to the League of Nations that it is willing to participate and has expressed agreement with the report. As for Russia, it will make a concrete decision after Foreign Minister Litvinov arrives in Moscow. It is said that the Soviet Union has attached two conditions to its participation in the Advisory Committee: (1) The United States must participate at the same time. (2) The United States must recognize Soviet Russia. Now the first item is no problem. As for the US recognition of Soviet Russia, Roosevelt had already expressed this intention. After Roosevelt takes office, he will start to proceed. Therefore, Russia's participation in the Advisory Committee should not cause problems. (1st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Yan Huiqing Departs for Russia Last Night</h3>
<p>World Attention Focuses on the Military Situation in the Far East</p>
<p>(Geneva) - Dr. Yan Huiqing, the chief representative of our country, departed Geneva tonight for Moscow to assume his new post as ambassador to Russia. Dr. Yan's actions have attracted worldwide attention. After the adoption of the report of the Nineteen-Member Committee at the Special Assembly, the importance of Moscow's position on the Far Eastern issue is no less than that of Washington. Moreover, Dr. Yan was a key figure in promoting the convening of the League of Nations Special Assembly. Before departing for Russia, Ambassador Yan told a Central News Agency reporter that the efforts of the Chinese delegation at the League of Nations aimed not only at safeguarding China's sovereignty but also at setting a good example for the future of world peace. Currently, the attention of various countries is temporarily focused on the military situation in the Far East. As for the application of Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant, it is largely a political issue and will take considerable time. If China wants various countries to isolate Japan, it should take decisive action, in which case a unified front against Japan by various countries is not impossible. After Ambassador Yan goes to Russia, he will return to Geneva at any time to handle all important matters. (Central News Agency dispatch, 1st)</p>
<h3>The Pacific Situation Becomes Increasingly Urgent, the U.S. Protects Radio</h3>
<p>Senate Bill Prevents Foreign Control</p>
<p>(Washington) - Today, the U.S. Senate passed a bill to prevent foreigners from gaining a dominant position in American radio companies. The main provision is that licenses will not be issued to radio companies where foreigners hold one-fifth or more of the shares or where their executives or directors are foreigners. The entire bill has now been sent to the President for signature. Currently, the major radio companies in the United States are purely American-owned and operated, and this bill is not expected to have an immediate impact. However, it is feared that foreigners may secretly buy up these companies in the future, and it also considers the situation during the outbreak of the European War in 1914, when there was a German radio station in the United States. Therefore, this measure is a precautionary one, prompted by the increasingly urgent situation in the Pacific. The bill was introduced by Senator Dill more than a year ago and was suddenly passed during a busy legislative session. (National News Agency dispatch, 1st)</p>

<p>(Changchun) - The ["Manchukuo"] government today announced that it has signed a contract with the South Manchuria Railway Company to entrust the management of all railways in Manchuria to the company.

The South Manchuria Railway Company is responsible for fulfilling the ["Manchukuo's"] obligations regarding railways to third parties, including the Zhongying Company's Shenyang-Shanhaiguan Railway. However, the contract does not mention the Chinese Eastern Railway. ["Manchukuo"] permits the South Manchuria Railway Company to construct railways from Dunhua to Tumen River, from Lafa to Harbin, and from Datong to Hailun, at an estimated cost of 100 million Japanese yen. The South Manchuria Railway Company agrees to lend 6 million Japanese yen to ["Manchukuo"] to purchase the Tianbaoshan-Tumen River light railway. (Reuters dispatch, 1st)</p>

At this time, in the cold of the northern land, you have tasted hardship. The workers of Beijing, in addition to uniting to swear to be your rear guard, hereby send a telegram of condolence."

<h3>Beijing Chamber of Commerce Submits Suggestions for Revitalizing Commerce</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) - Since the floods two years ago and then the national crisis, Beijing's finances have been depleted and commerce has declined.

(2) For shops that have already taken out loans but are unable to repay them, a lenient approach should be taken. (3) Shops should consider their creditworthiness when borrowing and should not delay payment without cause. They asked the authorities to adopt these measures to maintain the market.

<h3>German Dictatorship</h3>
<p>Hindenburg's New Order Abolishes Human Rights and Freedoms</p>
<p>Hitler Fully Crushes Communist Forces</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 28th - President Hindenburg has recently signed a new order. According to the order, Germany will implement an absolute dictatorship system, aided by de facto martial law. The order abolishes the articles in the Weimar Constitution guaranteeing individual freedom, the right to freedom of expression, freedom of publication, the right to hold meetings and organize societies, the secrecy of letters, telegrams, and telephones, and authorizes the central government to take over the administrative affairs of any state that fails to restore order. Anyone who attempts to assassinate the president or cabinet members or commits major crimes such as disrupting public order, rebellion, arson, poisoning, or damaging railways will be sentenced to death. The order also abolishes the articles in the constitution guaranteeing the safety of a criminal's residence from searches, confiscation, and investigation, and orders the authorities of each state to obey the instructions of the central government and implement all orders. The order also stipulates that anyone who commits crimes that disrupt public safety or oppose the state must be sentenced to long-term imprisonment or hard labor. Currently, 130 well-known members of the Communist Party and some non-Communist Party members have been taken into custody. The Prussian authorities declared today that there is no doubt that the Communist Party's great conspiracy to overthrow the current government by force has been discovered. Therefore, the most severe measures should be taken to contain the party. When the Berlin Communist Party headquarters was searched, fake orders were found addressed to police officers and National Socialist stormtroopers, ordering them to place poison in food and drinking water and to place women and children at the front of the ["terrorist"] groups when riots break out, and to set fire to various public offices, museums, palaces, and factories in order to start a regular civil war. According to the authorities, it has been confirmed that the Communist Party wore police and National Socialist stormtrooper uniforms to carry out riots in order to incite public hatred. The real leader of this terrorist organization is Communist Party member of the House of Representatives Mu Zenpei, who has now fled and is being hunted by the police. Armed police are now patrolling the areas of Berlin where riots frequently occur by car. All police in Prussia are ordered to be prepared at their posts day and night until the general election on March 5th.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 28th - The authorities' actions to suppress the Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party are not limited to Berlin. According to reports from major cities in Prussia, similar actions have been taken throughout the country. In Hanover, 140 people have been arrested. Tonight, the government's information director told representatives of the press that in six months, they should observe Hitler's achievements in eradicating communism from the world. At that time, there will be no more Social Democratic or Communist newspapers, the government will not change, and Germany will no longer have a parliament or democracy.</p>
<h3>Popular Sentiment Greatly Agitated, Domestic Politics Affected</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 28th - Yesterday's fire at the Reichstag has caused an unprecedented wave of agitation in the hearts of the German people, so it cannot but have a huge impact on Germany's domestic politics. Although the Reichstag was not completely destroyed, the remaining parts are no longer applicable. According to experts, if it is repaired, it will take at least a year to complete. The Reichstag will reconvene soon, and it will be necessary to find another building, but it is difficult to find one urgently. Today, the cabinet meeting discussed the aftermath. Prussian Acting Interior Minister Göring reported on the incident and the progress of the investigation. Based on various facts, such as the simultaneous fire at the abandoned palace of the German Emperor and the discovery of ignition materials in the basement of the Communist Party headquarters, it is sufficient to prove that the arson of the Reichstag cannot be blamed on the Communist Party. It is imperative that the government take severe measures to deal with the Communists. According to a report from the Dutch police authorities in Amsterdam, the arsonist Lubbe is a violent Communist member. In 1931, he resided in Soviet Russia with twenty other Dutch Communists and underwent training in terrorist methods. Among those arrested today in connection with this case is Kees, a writer who went to Shanghai last year to collect materials and write a book about China. The book has been published, but the title is unknown. There are also Ossietzky, a newspaper editor, and Professor Haar, an important member of the Human Rights League, and several others. A total of five Communist Party members of the Congress have been arrested. One of them personally went to the Ministry of Interior yesterday to declare that the German Communist Party did not participate in the burning of the Reichstag, but he was also detained. Today, the Social Democratic Party issued a declaration stating that the party has nothing to do with Lubbe's arson. Since the fire, people have been quite panicked, but the general election for the Reichstag will still be held on the scheduled date of March 5. The government has no intention of banning the Communist Party, because the current defensive equipment, as well as those that can be added at any time thereafter, are sufficient to prevent any chaos.</p>
<h3>Arsonists Number Ten, Repairs Will Take a Year</h3>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 28th - The area where the Reichstag was burned has been inspected by experts. Today, the opinion of the members is that the fire could not have been caused by one person alone. The police authorities also feel that the arrested Dutch Communist Lubbe must have had helpers, but Lubbe flatly denies it. According to a certain newspaper of the Dutch Communist Party, Lubbe was expelled from the party two years ago for committing violence. According to a certain waiter of the Reichstag, he saw Lubbe talking to two Communist Party members last night. The two left soon after. One of the two is Communist leader Torgler, who has surrendered himself to the police station today and is being held. Many parts of the Reichstag have been completely burned down, and it is now believed that it will take at least eight months to repair it.</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 28th - The loss from the fire in the Federal House of Representatives is not as great as people say. From the outside, it seems that there was no fire at all. Only a part of the furniture and partitions of the interior was destroyed. The central dome is completely undamaged.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 1st - After further investigation of the fire at the Reichstag, it is increasingly believed that there were ten arsonists at the time, who then escaped through an underground passage from the Reichstag across the street to the speaker's office.</p>
<p>Havas, Vienna, 1st - Two Russians came here from Germany this morning and were arrested by the Linz police on suspicion of participating in the arson of the German House of Representatives and are being closely interrogated.</p>
<h3>Disarmament Conference</h3>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 28th - Germany insists on obtaining a guarantee for the abolition of military aircraft before it is willing to discuss the internationalization of civil aviation. Consequently, a deadlock has emerged in the Aviation Committee of the Disarmament Conference. To break this deadlock, the Spanish representative, Madariaga, today presented a compromise solution to the German delegation. The German chief delegate has already telegraphed this matter to the Berlin government. The Aviation Committee is scheduled to convene at 10:30 tomorrow morning. If the German reply is satisfactory, the meeting can continue.</p>
<p>Havas, Geneva, 1st - The German representative has agreed to rejoin the work of the Aviation Committee. The Aviation Committee convened this morning to discuss the issue of the internationalization of civil aviation proposed by France. The French representative, Cot, replied to the German representative, Brandenburg, that while the prompt abolition of military aircraft is agreeable, the prompt realization of the internationalization of civil aviation and the organization of an international air force are also agreeable. If an international police force can be established, civil aviation will not be able to be converted into military use. Cot means that the internationalization of civil aviation will not hinder freedom of competition. After discussion, the chairman declared, "Can this committee declare that, in order to achieve the abolition of military aircraft, an international organization must be established, the responsibilities of which will be determined in the future?" Does the committee agree? The Indian representative reserved his opinion on the internationalization of aircraft, saying that it seems difficult to place the country's air routes under international supervision. The German representative said, "Is the plan for the internationalization of civil aviation universal, or only applicable to a region? If it is only applicable to a region, are countries outside of Europe willing to abolish military aircraft?" This question seems to be very difficult for a certain major overseas country. No one spoke in response. The German representative then said, "No one's speaking should be interpreted as tacit consent." The audience was surprised. The chairman replied, "Under these special circumstances, it cannot be interpreted as such," and immediately adjourned the meeting, scheduled to continue the discussion tomorrow morning.</p>
<h3>French Financial Bill</h3>
<p>Passed Finally in Parliament</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 1st - After a full night of deliberations, the Senate passed the financial bill today with a vote of 200 to 83. Subsequently, the Chamber of Deputies also passed it with a vote of 360 to 204. Daladier treated the negotiated compromise figure for the reduction of civil servant salaries as a matter of confidence, and ultimately won the support of both houses. Havas, Paris, 1st - As a result of the efforts of the government and the financial committees of both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies, the points of contention were finally agreed upon. In other words, the tax exemption standard passed by the Senate is based on an annual salary of 12,000 francs. A special tax of 2% to 8% is levied on any amount exceeding this. This section has been passed by the Chamber of Deputies. However, for civil servants with family dependents, the tax exemption standard will vary depending on the number of people they support, with this standard increasing by 3,000 francs for each additional person. The Chamber of Deputies still maintains the original proposal for this section. As for the modification of civil servant allowances, the Chamber of Deputies has also approved it in principle. This modification can reduce the national treasury's expenditure by 400 million francs. The above two articles were passed by the Chamber of Deputies with a majority of 360 to 214 votes and were immediately sent back to the Senate. Prime Minister Daladier raised a question of confidence in the Senate, asking the Senate to approve the first layer in accordance with the articles passed by the Chamber of Deputies, which was passed by the Senate with a majority of 182 to 89 votes. As for the second layer, it was also passed by a show of hands in the Senate, with a vote of 200 to 83.</p>
<h3>The U.S. Financial Crisis Worsens</h3>
<p>Banks in Various States Restrict Withdrawals</p>
<p>Ford's Bank Reorganization Runs into Trouble</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 28th - The serious situation in the American banking industry is worsening today. The states that have restricted withdrawals now include Michigan, Maryland, Ohio, Indiana, Arkansas, Tennessee, and Kentucky. The National Bank of Commerce in Washington also closed its doors this morning and has requested the currency comptroller to take it over. There are a total of 150 banks in Ohio that are restricting withdrawals in accordance with a legislative proposal. The number of banks in other states restricting withdrawals varies, but most of them are very strict, allowing only 5% or 15 dollars to be withdrawn. The issue of federal guarantees for bank deposits is still under discussion, but there is strong opposition from some quarters, who believe that this type of guarantee encourages dishonest management and unstable business practices. According to the Detroit News, the news that automobile magnate Ford's plan to establish two new banks there has run into trouble cannot alleviate concerns about the overall situation.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 28th - The National Bank of Commerce in Washington closed its doors today due to excessive withdrawals by depositors. The bank's deposits in December of last year totaled 11,302,625 gold dollars. The bank has now been taken over by the currency comptroller.</p>
<p>Reuters, Texarkana, 28th - Five banks here, with a total of $1.5 million in deposits, closed today. The Arkansas legislature has passed a proposal to quickly reorganize these five banks.</p>
<p>Reuters, Charleston, 28th - The West Virginia legislature today passed a bill authorizing the state to declare a bank holiday when necessary, and authorizing the banking commissioner to restrict bank withdrawals.</p>
<p>National, Washington, 28th - The Federal Reserve Board today released a weekly report stating that its total cash reserves are over 6 billion gold dollars and are currently being used to back up banks across the country and cope with the pressure of the financial crisis. In the past week alone, it has released 20.9 million gold dollars, all of which have been used to purchase government bonds and treasury bills, so that banks can have more cash flow. It is now believed that this move by the Bureau can also consolidate the position of government bonds in the market, making it easier for the government to raise funds to repay 700 million dollars in maturing bonds and treasury bills on March 15. And because this fundraising must go through banks, the Federal Reserve Board is currently doing everything possible to consolidate the position of the banks. As for the current financial situation in the states that have restricted withdrawals, according to financial sources, most have made progress, but Maryland has not yet made sufficient progress. Its governor has stated that the bank holiday is likely to be extended. In addition, Michigan's reorganization of two major banks by automobile king Ford has also encountered some difficulties. Ford's attempt to borrow 25 million dollars from New York bankers has been rejected, which will delay the reorganization. However, Ford and New York bankers often have disagreements, so this refusal to lend money is not surprising. Arkansas also authorized banks to restrict withdrawals today, and its legislature has passed a bill similar to those in Ohio and Pennsylvania.</p>

<h3>Inauguration Ceremony of U.S. President-Elect Roosevelt</h3>
<p>Inaugural Address Broadcast to All Countries by Radio</p>
<p>Special Session of Congress to be Convened in April</p>
<p>National, Washington, 28th - Preparations for the inauguration ceremony of U.S. President-elect Roosevelt have been completed today. The glass room on the reviewing stand has also been built. The current Senate will legally end its session at noon on Saturday, but since the law does not specify the use of Eastern Standard Time, the clock will be turned back at that time to allow the inauguration ceremony to be held. On that day, the new Vice President Garner will be sworn in first, administered by the current Vice President Curtis, followed by the swearing in of the new senators. Then, the list of the new cabinet will be submitted and passed. The new cabinet members will then be sworn in. Then, the new President Roosevelt and the outgoing President Hoover will go to the Senate chamber and be sworn in publicly. At this point, the Senate's task is completed, and they will all go to the East Portico of the Capitol to watch the new President's inauguration. The inaugural address will be broadcast to countries around the world by three major radio stations. After the grand ceremony is completed, it will be followed by a military parade and congratulations to the new President. The Senate's meeting on Saturday and the House of Representatives' meeting on Friday will both be the last regular sessions of this year. Because of the adoption of the constitutional amendment, the new Congress will be convened in January, not in December. However, according to the current situation, a special session will likely be convened in April of this year to discuss various important issues.</p>
<p>National, Washington, 28th - U.S. President-elect Roosevelt today announced two more new cabinet members. The current list of all cabinet members is: Secretary of State Hull, Secretary of the Treasury Woodin, Secretary of War Dern, Secretary of the Navy Swanson, Attorney General Walsh, Postmaster General Farley, Secretary of the Interior Ickes, Secretary of Commerce Roper, Secretary of Agriculture Wallace, and Secretary of Labor Miss Perkins. It is expected that the Senate will agree to this list.</p>
<h3>Bolivia-Paraguay Armistice</h3>
<p>Armed Mediation by Three Countries Succeeds</p>
<p>Reuters, Santiago, Chile, 28th - The Paraguayan government today accepted the truce proposal made by Brazil, Chile, and Peru regarding the Chaco dispute between Bolivia and Paraguay. In early February, the foreign ministers of Argentina and Chile reached an agreement to resolve the Chaco dispute, stipulating that Argentina, Chile, and Brazil should declare neutrality and prevent the supply of arms to the belligerent countries. Afterwards, it was suggested that the presidents of Argentina, Brazil, and Chile hold a meeting to express the determination of the countries to resolve the dispute with Bolivia and Paraguay.</p>
<h3>Fascist Combination</h3>
<p>Hitler to Meet Mussolini in Rome</p>
<p>National, Paris, 28th - According to the Geneva correspondent of Le Petit Parisien, a certain important person who recently returned from Germany said that the heads of state of Germany and Italy will meet soon. Hitler is expected to officially visit Rome from March 20th to 25th.</p>
<p>Havas, Geneva, 28th - Italian newspapers report that the new treaty of the Balkan Entente contains a military agreement and has secret clauses. Some members of the Italian Parliament have also made this assertion. Today, the secretariat of the Balkan Entente firmly denied this speculation, saying that the secret clauses in the new treaty of the Balkan Entente, which were recently published by an Italian newspaper, are completely fabricated.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Urgently Attacks Jehol to Seize Fuel and Mineral Resources</h3>
<p>Out of Fear of Economic Blockade by the Great Powers</p>
<p>Osaka Mainichi Shimbun, 25th - The mineral resources of eastern Mongolia are the best in the world. Places such as Chaoyang, Jianchang, Pingquan, Jingpeng, Kailu, Linxi, Tongliao, Xinlitun, Xinqiu, and Beipiao are particularly rich in gold, silver, copper, iron, petroleum, coal, and other minerals. Japan is now determined to withdraw from the League of Nations and does not hesitate to confront the world. Everything else is not to be feared. What is most feared at present is the fuel problem. Because most of the petroleum used in Japan is supplied by the United States, once the economy is blockaded by the great powers, this source of fuel will be cut off, and the people's livelihood will be thrown into panic. Japan is now trying to solve the fuel problem after being blockaded, so it is urgently attacking Jehol, hoping to completely occupy the mineral resources of eastern Mongolia in the shortest possible time and carry out emergency mining. According to a recent Japanese survey, the Xinqiu area, 400 miles from Xinminfu, contains 100 million tons of petroleum and coal. The area of the mining area is comparable to that of the Fushun coal mine. Before last year, the South Manchuria Railway Company intended to invest in mining, but at that time, Japan had no right to lay railways between Xinminfu and Xinqiu. Everything had to be negotiated with Zhang Zuolin. As for laying transportation railways, it also failed to obtain the understanding of the British side of the Beijing-Fengtian Railway and the Northeast government. As a result, it has been eagerly awaited but has not been realized until now. Since the establishment of [Manchukuo], the actions of the Japanese army north of the Great Wall have not been restricted by third countries. As for laying railways and mining resources, it is naturally not a problem.</p>
<h3>India's Financial Situation</h3>
<p>Reuters, New Delhi, 28th - The chairman of the Indian Parliamentary Finance Committee, Schuster, said in Parliament today when presenting the budget that existing taxes have not been reduced, and new taxes have not been levied, with only slight changes to the import tax on shoes and rayon goods, and stamp duties on checks. Schuster claimed that his budget would have a surplus of 4.2 million rupees in the fiscal year 1933-1934. In his financial amendment, he proposed a tax of four annas per square yard for pure rayon goods and a tax of two annas and three paisas for blended fabrics. The surplus for this fiscal year is £1,627,500. India, in the two most difficult years, has not only been able to make ends meet, but also has £3,112,500 to reduce debt. India's floating debt has been reduced from £63,000,000 to £26,000,000. India's gold exports are necessary, and even if India exports three times as much cash as it does today, India will still have a lot of cash left in the country, no less than it did eleven years ago.</p>

<h3>Situation After the Japanese Army's General Attack on Jehol</h3>
<p>Japanese Aircraft Bombard Chaoyang</p>
<p>Enemy's Target Focuses on Chifeng</p>
<p>Our Army Now Takes Defensive Offensive</p>
<p>Beijing Correspondence: Since the Japanese army's general attack on Jehol on February 25, battles have occurred in Chaoyang, Lingnan, and Kailu. Our army's morale is extremely high. The war situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Chaoyang and Lingnan</p>
<p>Fierce fighting in Chaoyang on the 25th, day and night. The Japanese army on the Chaoyang line broke into the Mangniuyingzi position of our army and approached Chaoyang. Our Dong brigade used its main force to meet the attack, while making the necessary contact. A large number of Japanese aircraft took advantage of the situation and dropped bombs on the city of Chaoyang on the 25th. The bombs dropped were incendiary bombs, about 200 in total. The whole city was on fire, and thick smoke covered the sky. The fire had not been extinguished as of yesterday (the 26th). The main force of the Japanese army changed its strategy because Chaoyang was not militarily important, attempting to coordinate with the Japanese army coming from Suizhong to attack Lingnan from both sides. The enemy also advanced from both wings, with about 30,000 troops on each route. In addition, there were five detachments of the puppet state Zhang Haipeng, etc. Their front line extended from Damiao to Taipingfang. The Japanese army that invaded Lingnan the day before yesterday came into contact with our army at Shaomaoshan. In addition to the original garrison brigade in Lingnan, our army also deployed an infantry brigade. When the enemy attacked the night before last, our army fiercely attacked and the enemy retreated in disarray. Our army has recaptured Baishizui Gate. After this heavy blow, the Japanese army urgently transferred more than 10,000 reinforcements from Suizhong to launch an attack. Also, from yesterday morning to the afternoon, Japanese aircraft flew to Lingyuan and Lingnan to carry out a large-scale bombing. Bombs were dropped everywhere in the nearby villages, causing terrible damage. Our army has a meticulous arrangement from the northeast of Chaoyang to the Shaomaoshan area, with a front line of more than 40 miles. The morale of all the troops is extremely high, and they are determined to defend to the death. Also, Dong Futing, the brigade commander, telegraphed to Beijing yesterday, saying that the Japanese army had sent a large number of Japanese aircraft to bomb Chaoyang. The addresses of post and telegraph offices were mostly bombed, and the Yushun Temple pagodas, a famous scenic spot there, were also destroyed. The Japanese aircraft dropped incendiary bombs, which started fires in four places. As of yesterday afternoon, the city was still burning.</p>
<p>Kailu and Suidong</p>
<p>The volunteer army and the Cui brigade of the Jehol army withdrew from Kailu on the morning of the 24th. They are still fighting fiercely with the Zhang Haipeng troops of the puppet army and a part of the Japanese army in the vicinity of Kailu, in Dala and other places. The goal of the Japanese and puppet troops on this route is Chifeng. However, the desert blocks the way between Kailu and Chifeng. The Japanese army has prepared 8,000 vehicles to carry out transportation work, and more than 4,000 vehicles have already left the puppet state's territory. In addition to the front line's efforts to counterattack, Chifeng is also fully prepared. On the Suidong side, a joint Japanese and puppet infantry unit was discovered yesterday morning, and the volunteer army of Feng Zhanhai is meeting the attack. Fuxin is still guarded by a unit of the volunteer army. This place is relatively dangerous, and the enemy army has not yet launched a large-scale attack. In this Japanese army's invasion of Jehol, in addition to the puppet troops of Zhang Haipeng, Yu Zhishan, and Cheng Guorui, there are an estimated 60,000 Japanese troops, with about 30,000 deployed in the Kailu area and about 30,000 in the Beipiao Chaoyang Lingnan area. Their combat plan is to concentrate their main force and break through a single point. Our army first takes a defensive posture. The front line is too long, so the front line has now been shortened to take a defensive offensive, and a plan to replenish troops is being implemented, so that strength can be concentrated. In addition, because the mountain roads are dangerous, it will be possible to wait at leisure and deal a heavy blow to the enemy army. The recent situation depends on how the progress in the Lingnan area goes. I have gathered a large force and am determined to defend to the death. Also, Tang Yulin, chairman of the Jehol Provincial Government, announced to European and American reporters yesterday that the Jehol army had shortened its front line in order to concentrate its forces. If the Japanese army invades, it will launch a full-scale attack. The main battle in the future may be in Lingyuan or Chifeng. Tang himself intends to go to the front to supervise the battle in person to boost morale, and has now sent a certain senior officer of the Jehol army to Lingyuan to make arrangements. The morale of the front line is extremely high, and they are vowing to fight the Japanese army. Our army has deployed defenses at every point on the Lingyuan, Pingquan, Jianping, and Chifeng lines, and the positions are extremely solid (February 27).</p>
<h3>Japan Implements Military and Political Reform Plan</h3>
<p>Tokyo Correspondence: The Japanese imperialist army, through the Manchurian War and the Shanghai War, gained unprecedented experience. Due to the Chinese people's active anti-imperialism, the heroic resistance of Chinese soldiers, and open anti-war sentiment among Japanese lower-ranking soldiers at rallying points and on the battlefield, they suffered repeated defeats. Faced with these failures, the Japanese military authorities are implementing military and political reforms to cope, with the following strategies:</p>
<p>First, Replenishing Military Strength in Manchuria</p>
<p>Manchuria and Mongolia are the Japanese imperialist base for attacking the Soviet Union. Since the September 18th Incident, over twenty aircraft factories have been established, especially around Shenyang, Jinzhou, Qiqihar, Changchun, and Jilin. Dozens of military roads for transporting troops have been constructed, and plans are underway to increase barracks, naval ports, and build large-scale military factories, actively consolidating the forward base for the war of aggression. However, the destruction of railways, attacks on cities, and occupation of urban areas by workers, peasants, and soldiers in the Northeast have caused great difficulties for Japanese warlords. The resistance movement has occurred more than five thousand times to date, and Japan is already exhausted. The so-called replenishment of military strength in Manchuria is nothing more than using tanks, aircraft, poison gas, and artillery to suppress the Northeast Volunteer Army, and then challenge the Soviet Union and North China.</p>
<p>Second, Training Professional Weapons Technicians and Junior Non-commissioned Officers</p>
<p>The Japanese army has traditionally adopted a conscription system, but now it wants to train 100,000 specialized technicians. This clearly marks a shift away from the traditional feeding-soldiers system, indicating the partial collapse of the conscription system. These technicians will be selected from young people, given fascist education, and trained in operating technology. The Navy has been recruiting "Young Aviation Soldiers" since last year [the Army is also recruiting this spring] and has gathered 170 aviation communication young soldiers. Training methods for junior non-commissioned officers include: (1) enhancing the number of officer students; (2) implementing a short-term volunteer officer system; (3) increasing special warrant officers; and (4) establishing new institutions for training special types of junior officers.</p>
<p>Third, Mechanization of the Military</p>
<p>The content of the reform is the modernization of the entire army's armament, manufacturing heavy and light machine guns, new-style field guns, heavy artillery, anti-aircraft guns, infantry guns, grenade launchers, aircraft, tanks, armored vehicles, poison gas, etc. The main targets of combat are the Soviet Union and the Chinese anti-Japanese forces and armed anti-Japanese people. The army currently has 838 aircraft, with about 300 in preparation, for a total of 1,138 aircraft. The Navy has 1,000 aircraft, bringing the total to 2,138 aircraft. The military reform plan particularly emphasizes the preparation of aircraft and strives for qualitative improvement. Direct deployments are currently in Fengtian, Qiqihar, Jilin, and other places. As for the reform of tanks and armored vehicles, it is precisely because the target of the Japanese imperialist war is secretly the Soviet Union, and the battlefield will be on the plains of Manchuria and Siberia, so the Japanese army is particularly strengthening tanks and armored vehicles, especially the plan to motorize various transportation systems. Now, the Japanese warlords are even using the Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan for the production of mechanized equipment as propaganda material for their military preparations, citing the production efficiency of the Soviet Union's Tractor Plant and the extraordinary advance of the Red Army's tank units as an excuse to promote the expansion and replenishment of the Japanese army [the Army Ministry has published a list of new weapons preparations for various countries]. Although they point out that the Soviet Union has 600 tanks, while Japan has only 40, this is completely deceptive. According to news from workers at the Army Factory, Mitsubishi Aviation Works had already completed the manufacture of the latest light tank, serial number NO. 325, at the end of last year, and it is currently undergoing test runs. From this, it can be seen that there are at least 325 tanks and more than 600 tankettes. (China United News Agency)</p>
<p>Yellow River's Huanghuasi People's Embankment Breached Upstream</p>
<p>Over Thirty Villages Flooded</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: This year's ice flood on the Yellow River, due to the erratic warm and cold weather, with ice blocks alternately thawing and freezing, has caused the water level to rise, dangerous conditions to emerge daily, and embankments to be damaged, resulting in huge losses. Fortunately, sunny and warm weather has continued for days, and the ice has thawed, allowing the situation to stabilize. However, in the Huanghuasi area of Shouzhang County upstream, the river water has repeatedly poured back through the openings, overflowing into the people's embankments and flooding villages during both summer and ice floods. This year, during the ice flood, the situation was particularly critical due to the intermittent thawing and freezing of ice blocks, leading to the re-emergence of dangerous conditions and the flooding of over thirty villages. Houses have collapsed, and people and livestock have been displaced, creating a terrible scene. According to a telegram from the Gaoyi Embankment Works Bureau, at 8:00 AM on the 8th, ice accumulated in the Xinzhuang River, causing the water to rise sharply and violently. New embankments near Xiaoying Village and Tangyihe Village were breached repeatedly by the flood. Hundreds of laborers were mobilized to try their best to protect them, and fortunately, disaster was averted. However, at noon on the 9th, the river ice at Majiacha River became congested, preventing the water from flowing downstream, and it poured into the embankments from the Huanghuasi opening, flooding over thirty villages. The situation is extremely dire. According to reports, the people's embankments in the area are built and maintained by the people themselves, and the River Affairs Bureau is not responsible. Due to disagreements between the people on both banks of the river, there have been many oversights in construction and maintenance. To resolve the disputes, the River Affairs Bureau has revised the regulations for the people's embankments, requiring each bank to protect and repair the valleys. The revisions have been submitted to the provincial government for review and will be implemented upon approval. As for the Shouzhang County disaster victims, the provincial government has prepared to instruct the Relief Committee to allocate funds for relief. (February 27th)</p>
<p>Songjiang Xiaokunshan Burglaries for Several Nights</p>
<p>In the Tangjiawan area of Xiaokunshan, District 9 of the county, which is the thoroughfare from Songjiang to Tianmashan, via Changxing Bridge, directly to the Mao River, bandits have arisen. Last night (28th), at around 12:00 AM, seven or eight bandits suddenly came to Wang Qiuyuan's house, armed with guns. They broke down the door and entered. The head of the household was awakened from his sleep and was immediately forced by the bandits to reveal the location of hidden silver. When he could not answer, Qiuyuan's mother and his elder brother, Liuyuan, and his wife were all burned with candles, a truly terrible sight. Pearls worth 150 yuan were stolen, and the bandits left swaggeringly. Wang Jingyun's wife, a young widow in the same village, was also cut and robbed, losing clothing and other items. The head of the household, Wang Qiuyuan, has come to Songjiang to report to the authorities and request the arrest of the bandits and the recovery of the stolen goods. The injured people have gone to St. Joseph's Hospital for treatment. On the night of the 27th, three families with the surname Cao and thirteen families with the surname Zhao in Xixian Village in the same district were also robbed and plundered. The people in the district are all uneasy and have telegraphed a request for the Cao Regiment to be transferred back to Songjiang.</p>
<p>The district chiefs of this county, concerned about the rampant banditry in the countryside, jointly submitted a petition to the provincial government during yesterday's district chiefs' meeting, along with various organizations such as the Education Association, stating that the situation is unstable, bandits are rising up, and local defense depends on personnel. Since the Security Second Regiment Commander Cao Pang was ordered to transfer defenses from Songjiang, bandits have suddenly risen in the countryside, and the local people are uneasy. They are especially concerned and urgently request that the regiment be ordered to return to defense immediately to provide deterrence and reassure the public.</p>
<p>Suzhou</p>
<p>Japanese Consul Requests Protection for Japanese Residents</p>
<p>Recently, the war in the Northeast has become increasingly urgent. Japanese residents here are acting nervously. Japanese shops are preparing to close. A portion of Japanese residents transported their luggage to Shanghai a few days ago, and Japanese residents are preparing to leave Suzhou. The Japanese Consul in Suzhou, Kawaminami Seiichi, accompanied by Chinese translator Lin Fuchu, visited Wu County Magistrate Zou Xiaogong yesterday, requesting that the Public Security Bureau be ordered to effectively protect Japanese residents in Suzhou. Magistrate Zou agreed to order the bureau to provide adequate protection. The Japanese Consul then departed.</p>
<h3>Xu Caizhen's Appeal Case Requesting Interpretation from the Supreme Court</h3>
<p>Xu Caizhen, a woman, went on an outing with her fiancé, Ma Baolin, the young owner of Ma Yuanji Silk Store, and was reprimanded by her in-laws upon their return. Both attempted suicide by poison. Baolin died, but Caizhen was rescued. She was refused entry to her husband's home for the funeral and filed a lawsuit, losing in the local court. She then appealed to the High Court to determine her status as a widow. Yesterday (the 1st), the High Court's Civil Division One held a hearing. Judge Chen Jichi tried to mediate a settlement between the lawyers of both parties, but it failed. The debate then began. As a result, the appellant requested the High Court to submit the point of marital relationship to the Supreme Court for interpretation. The court agreed and adjourned, stating that the hearing would resume after the interpretation was received.</p>
<p>Changshu</p>
<p>Reducing Electricity Rates Submitted to Province for Approval</p>
<p>The electricity plant in this county has been operating for more than a decade. However, the electricity rates are quite high, costing as much as three jiao per unit. After negotiations between the user association and the company, the rate was reduced to two jiao and a half. However, the Provincial Construction Committee still considered the rate to be too high and ordered it to be reduced to two jiao and five fen per unit, with discounts for usage exceeding fifty units. The company argued that due to malfunctioning equipment and high coal consumption, it could not compare with other places and thus adopted a tiered system. Generally, from one unit to one hundred units, the rate is two jiao and five fen per unit; from one hundred units to one hundred and fifty units, it is two jiao and two fen; from one hundred and fifty units to two hundred units, it is two jiao per unit; and for usage above three hundred units, it is only one jiao and eight fen. This plan has been submitted to the province for approval.</p>
<p>Wuxi County Government Takes Over Construction Bureau</p>
<p>The County Construction Bureau of this county was ordered to close by the end of February, and on March 1st, it merged with the County Office. The Construction Bureau has complied with the order and closed, awaiting handover. At 9:00 AM yesterday, County Magistrate Chen assigned County Government Section Members Wu Qichao and Sang Xirong as receiving officers to inspect and take over all documents, equipment, funds, and materials from the bureau. After the Construction Bureau merged with the County Office, the position of chief engineer was formally appointed by County Magistrate Chen to Xiao Zicai, the former director of the Construction Bureau. Although Xiao had intentions to resign, County Magistrate Chen, considering his familiarity with the work, sincerely persuaded him to stay and work together. As for the technical staff, County Magistrate Chen has appointed Huang Decun, the former director of the Technical Section of the Construction Bureau, and Jiang Guanbo of the Highway Office. The remaining staff members have not yet been announced.</p>

After the county's preliminary trial, Yao Mingzhi and others were sentenced to imprisonment and fines for extorting money in the name of the union. Yao refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the High Court. The County Government also petitioned the High Court to transfer jurisdiction. The High Court then sent the case to the Wuxi County Court for trial.</p>
<p>Zhenjiang Bureau of Weights and Measures to Continue Operations</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Bureau of Weights and Measures was originally under the jurisdiction of the Department of Industry. However, due to the abolition of the Department of Industry, the bureau was also abolished and its responsibilities were merged into the Department of Construction. Now, Director Dong, recognizing that the new system of weights and measures is still in the process of being implemented and that it is necessary to restore the original bureau, has specially requested and received approval from the Provincial Government to continue to establish and operate the bureau to assume special responsibility. It is reported that the position of director of the bureau will be concurrently held by Xu Tigang, the director of the department in charge of the bureau, and Sun Qichang will be appointed as a first-class inspector.</p>
<p>Nantong Provincial and County Police and Militia Search for Bandits</p>

County Magistrate Huang first ordered Wu Benliang, the captain of the First Police Company, to lead his troops to rush to the area to deploy defenses. He also ordered the public security bureaus, defense corps, and industrial police teams along the coast to cooperate in strict defense. He also sent letters to the tax police for assistance. When five ships of mutinying soldiers arrived at Beijiang, they realized that there were preparations, so they fled to Xinyang Port near Yancheng. This county also sent a team to pursue and encircle them, so the local area was able to be secured.</p>

<p>The Central Mint was originally scheduled to officially hold its opening ceremony yesterday and officially begin minting at 3:00 PM. The Ministry of Finance also sent Xu Kan, Director of the Currency Department, as a representative to participate. The factory erected a decorative archway at the factory gate yesterday and decorated it with silk ribbons. However, at 2:00 AM yesterday, Director Guo suddenly received a telegram from the Ministry of Finance stating that in the face of national crisis, everything should be simplified, and instructing that the opening ceremony be postponed.

<h3>The Gate of the Central Mint (Photo by Xu Tianzhang) Front of the New Silver Coin</h3>
<p>Minting Situation: This reporter visited the factory yesterday afternoon and, under the guidance of engineer Zhang Deqing, first entered the smelting room. Workers were busy with smelting work, placing silver ingots into the pot and covering them with coal dust to isolate them from the air and reduce consumption. After the silver ingots reached a fineness of 880/1000, they were cast into silver bars and rolled into thin sheets on a rolling mill, cut short, and then put into a coining press.</p>

<p>, pressed into the shape, and then heated in a furnace to facilitate stamping. After heating, they were put into a cleaning machine. Once the surface was clean, the initial edge was rolled. Then the design was stamped, and the silver dollar was completed. Fearing inconsistencies in weight, they were put into a corrector to correct them, and the lighter ones were removed. The silver shavings from the smelting were put into a scrap grinding machine for refining. The factory has a total of 186 workers, and the working hours are from 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM every day. According to Mr. Zhang, the daily output has not yet been determined.</p>
<h3>Standard Silver Coin</h3>

Gross weight is 26.691 grams, fineness is 880/1000, and the pure silver weight is 23.493448 grams. The front features the image of Sun Yat-sen, with the words "Republic of China, Year 21" at the top. The back features a sandpiper and a sailboat, with the words "One Yuan" on both sides.</p>
<h3>Awaiting Orders</h3>
<p>The factory has not yet received orders from the Ministry and has not yet decided whether to mint freely or by the state. Therefore, it has not yet been able to negotiate with banks or other sectors on entrusting minting, etc. Although the new coins have been minted, they have not yet been released on the market because the Legislative Yuan has not yet passed the Currency Law.</p>

<h3>Aviation Association Seeks Contributions</h3>
<p>Teams compete to receive pledge forms</p>
<p>Mayor Wu Holds Tea Party with New Team Leaders Today</p>
<p>Yesterday was the day the Chinese Aviation Association began recruiting members in Shanghai and raising funds to purchase aircraft. According to the Association's solicitation methods, the first announcement will be made on the 15th of this month. What were the results of the first day? There is still no formal report. Team leaders and team members are very enthusiastic and have rushed to the Baxianqiao office to obtain blank pledge forms for distribution. Among the team leaders, Mr. Guo Shun of Wing On Textile Factory requested an additional 2,500 forms after the 5,000 he received were not enough. Mr. Zhang Shouping of the Shishi Xinbao and Mr. Guo Le of Wing On Company each received 5,000 forms from the Association. Other teams also received many forms. Everyone is vying to be the first, and it is expected that the results of the first announcement on the 15th will be impressive. The news on continuing fundraising is divided as follows:</p>
<p>Tea Party for New Team Leaders</p>
<p>General Team Leader Wu Zhucheng has been urging day and night to recruit members, sparing no effort. He also believes that Shanghai is a diverse city with a large population, so there should be as many recruiting teams as possible. In addition to the existing 300 teams, he is making every effort to increase the number of teams and has scheduled a tea party for new team leaders at the YMCA office at 4:00 PM today to exchange views and discuss methods for vigorous progress. The team leaders believe that the final results of each team depend on the enthusiasm and ability of the team members, so they are paying close attention to the selection of team members. It is reported that a large number of people are volunteering to join, which shows the enthusiasm of the people of Shanghai for saving the country through aviation.</p>
<p>Methods for Transferring Contributions for Aircraft</p>
<p>In addition to recruiting members, the Association is also fundraising. Patriotic people generally believe that the membership fee is too small to reach the target of 2 million yuan, and they are willing to donate extra to speed up the process. It is reported that various groups in Shanghai, such as the banking sector, real estate sector, labor sector, and education sector, plan to sponsor the price of one or more aircraft. Mr. Shi Liangcai, a leader in the press, is planning the implementation of [press aircraft]. Other hometown associations, in addition to the Ningbo Hometown Association, which has already started, the Guangdong Hometown Association will also begin to take action. The members of these two hometown associations have no shortage of wealth and assets, and their future success can be predicted.</p>

We plan to divide into two teams, allowing people to choose: the Fighter Aircraft Team and the Destroyer Aircraft Team. The temporary goal is 200,000 yuan, and we hope to complete the project in one month.

It is not only the glory of our fellow townsmen, but also the greatest manifestation of the Chinese nation's unity and struggle. I hope that my parents, brothers, and sisters will rise up and take action immediately.</p>

<h3>Comfort Delegation Heads North This Morning</h3>
<p>All Sectors Send Representatives to the Station to See Them Off</p>
<p>Various groups in the city, such as the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, General Labor Union, Lawyers' Association, Education Association, and Municipal Farmers' Association, jointly launched the Shanghai All Sectors Comforting Soldiers Association because the soldiers at the front are fighting bravely in the bloody battle, and their contribution to the country is great. In addition to procuring large quantities of goods to be transported to the front lines, they have also sent representatives Wu Kaixian, Zheng Chengqing, Zhu Wenqi, Shen Junru, Wu Yunzhai, and Ye Fuxiao to the front lines of Rehe to comfort the soldiers. They are scheduled to head north on the express train on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway this morning. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Message to the Soldiers</p>
<p>The Comfort Delegation specially issued a message to the soldiers at the front, saying, "Our respected soldiers at the front, you are braving the wind and sleeping in the open, enduring hunger and thirst, risking your lives, and constantly fighting with strong enemies. Why do you do this? In a word, it is for the country and for the nation. Therefore, the people of the whole country are already on the same battle line of life and death as you. If the people are like sleeves and stand by as bystanders, standing in the position of outsiders, we dare to assert that they are not human beings and not Chinese citizens. I dare to believe that there are no such cold-blooded animals in the whole country. Soldiers, work hard! The people of the whole country will never fail you. The comfort items collected by all sectors in Shanghai this time, although not large in number, are also a manifestation of the people's full support. We hope that you will accept this enthusiasm and work hard for the country. All sectors in Shanghai will continue to provide you with assistance to the best of their ability." Shanghai Municipal Party Department, Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Shanghai Municipal Labor Union, Shanghai Municipal Education Association, Shanghai Municipal Farmers' Association, Shanghai Municipal Lawyers' Association, Shanghai Municipal Certified Public Accountants Association.</p>
<p>Farewell from All Sectors</p>
<p>The various trade associations, labor unions, and citizens' branches in this city, recognizing that the representatives are traveling far and wide to comfort the country, have specially sent representatives from the trade associations Zheng Zenan, Xie Zhongle, Ma Shaoquan, Jin Runxiang, Li Ruzhang, Yuan Hongjun, Cheng Guichu, and others, labor union representatives Zhu Xuefan and Li Yongxiang, and citizen branch representatives Jiang Junyi and Wang Jian'e, a total of more than one hundred people, to the station to bid farewell.</p>
<p>List of Representatives</p>

<h3>Wusong Telephone Officially Opened Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, in order to facilitate telephone communication for the people of Wusong, is actively proceeding with the restoration of telephone service there. All trunk line and other projects have been completed. Trial calls the other day were exceptionally clear. By order of the Ministry, official communication began on March 1st.</p>
<h3>Siam Favors Japan, Suppresses Chinese Goods; National Goods Association Calls for Vigorous Protest Via Telegram</h3>
<p>The National Goods Factories United Association yesterday telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stating that the Siamese government has recently supplemented immigration entry regulations, restricting the entry of Chinese, increasing the fees for return Siamese residence permits and residence fees, and shortening the valid period. This is clearly a Japanese movement. Observing the abstention of the Siamese representative during the passage of the report at the recent League of Nations General Assembly, their pro-Japanese sentiment is evident. It is imperative that your ministry vigorously protest based on reason, expedite negotiations to protect national rights and protect overseas Chinese. The telegram awaits your command with utmost anticipation.</p>
<h3>Interruption of Commercial Transportation in North China</h3>
<p>Shanghai and Tianjin Merchants Groups Conclude Business</p>
<p>The Japanese naval blockade of the Baihe River is in active preparation. A large quantity of flour in Shanghai is being urgently loaded onto additional ships in recent days. Northern merchants based in this city received telegrams from Tianjin in the past two days, ordering the Shanghai side to cease procurement of goods due to the tense situation. Furthermore, the business representatives from various Shanghai industries stationed in Tianjin have been uniformly concluding business and preparing to depart Tianjin to the south since March. Commercial trade between Shanghai and Tianjin has effectively ceased since yesterday. Goods destined for European and American countries via Tianjin have also largely ceased transportation.</p>
<p>Japanese Emphasis on Qingdao</p>
<p>Qingdao is the only seaport in Shandong. Since the Rehe Incident, the Japanese have placed particular emphasis on Qingdao. The second foreign detachment warships stationed there are gradually moving towards the Haizhou area. Furthermore, the Sasebo Naval Port has specially dispatched two cruisers and four destroyers to form a squadron and proceed to Qingdao. According to news from the Japanese Third Fleet in this city, the newly dispatched fleet has already departed and will arrive in Qingdao imminently. Due to the significant increase in Japanese naval forces in Qingdao, the Dalian Steamship Company has specially opened a new route between Qingdao, Tianjin, and Dalian starting from March 5, exclusively for Japanese military transportation.</p>
<p>Japanese Goods Expedited for Transportation</p>
<p>Japanese trade in various Yangtze River ports has not yet ceased. However, amidst this tense atmosphere, approximately 70,000 to 80,000 pieces of goods that have not yet been shipped from Japan have been ordered to be loaded urgently, aiming to be completed within the next two weeks. Six ships, including the *Namiwa Maru*, *Ikoma Maru*, *Kasagi Maru*, *Mikasa Maru*, *Maya Maru*, and *Aso Maru*, have been assigned to load and transport them all to Shanghai for transshipment. Another 10,000+ pieces will be directly loaded for various Yangtze River ports.</p>
<h3>Emergency Telegram from the Chinese Women's Association for the Relief of Compatriots in the Northeast</h3>
<p>The Chinese Women's Association for the Relief of Compatriots in the Northeast sent two telegrams on the same day, one to the front-line soldiers, expressing their willingness to be the rearguard, and one to Chairman Chiang, which is omitted. The telegram to the front-line soldiers reads: "Commander Zhang in Beiping, Commander-in-Chief Zhang in Rehe, Chairman Tang, and all soldiers in the Northeast, your distinguished attention. The Japanese invaders are tyrannical, engaging in relentless militarism and exhausting the wealth and lives of their entire nation in the hope of achieving their ambition of aggression. Now they even want to withdraw from the League of Nations, willingly becoming the ringleaders of the barbarians, intensifying the war in Rehe, plotting against Beiping and Tianjin, and are poised to advance into the heartland. This is akin to thieves entering the household and disease reaching the incurable stage. Which citizen would willingly sit idle and await death? The members of our association, bearing a sense of individual responsibility and a determination to fight to the bitter end, vow to unite women across the country, eagerly donate, and serve as the rearguard for killing the enemy. All our front-line soldiers, fighting for justice and righteousness, fighting for national survival, will surely be able to defeat a thousand with one, diminishing the enemy’s strength. Our association anticipates this with utmost anticipation. In this telegram filled with sorrow and indignation, we await news of victory."</p>

<h3>Inauguration of the Shanghai East District Citizens' Association to Reject Water Cutoffs Yesterday</h3>
<p>Real Estate Association Sends Letter to the City Chamber of Commerce and Others Seeking Assistance</p>
<p>The Municipal Council Believes This Matter Has Hope of Resolution</p>
<p>In areas such as Sanxingfang on Tangshan Road and Shunchengli on Yangshupu Road, the forced water cutoffs by the water company have aroused opposition from tenants. The United Committee of Citizens in the Shanghai East District to Reject Water Cutoffs was organized the day before yesterday, and the inaugural meeting was held yesterday at No. 14, Shishanli, East Seward Road.

<p>Letter from the Real Estate Association</p>
<p>The Shanghai Real Estate Association sent a letter yesterday to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and the Banking Industry Practice Association, stating: "To the esteemed: Since the Shanghai Public Concession Waterworks Company</p>
<h3>Has Been Operating Exclusively</h3>
<p>For forty or fifty years, there was no interest guarantee before 1928. Water fees were calculated as 5% of the rent, which was considered appropriate for adjusting the social economy. Even with rising prices, water fees also increased with rent, so the company's reserve funds were quite substantial. However, on March 10, 1928, before the Chinese directors of the Municipal Council were about to join, they re-entered into a new contract with the water company, promising an interest guarantee of 9% and distributing the accumulated reserve funds to shareholders in the form of bonus shares. Thus, the non-interest-bearing reserve funds were transformed into interest-bearing bonus shares with a guarantee of 9%, and the company's</p>
<h3>Burden Increased.</h3>
<p>The company's burden was inevitably passed on to the users. Fortunately, water fees were still calculated based on rent, but increased from 5% to 6%. Unexpectedly, due to exchange rate fluctuations in 1930, when the company's capital was in monetary units, the water company requested and received approval from the Municipal Council to add an additional 25% surcharge, totaling 7.5% of the rent. Public opinion was immediately in an uproar. The water company then threatened to cut off the water supply. Social figures were particularly indignant, and the Municipal Council reluctantly complied with public opinion and convened a special board meeting to</p>
<h3>Establish a Research Committee</h3>
<p>And invited American expert Mr. Hill to Shanghai to investigate. However, the so-called surcharge was still paid under protest. Mr. Hill's report implied that the company's capital unit should be in silver and that the exchange rate losses should be borne by the shareholders. He also argued that if the conditions were appropriate, water meters should be used for billing to control waste, especially without increasing the burden on poor and small households. As for whether Mr. Hill's estimate of the water company's assets was too high, that is another issue, which will not be elaborated on here. The water company, regarding Mr. Hill's other comments and suggestions,</p>
<h3>Made No Improvements</h3>
<p>Except that, taking advantage of the imminent Japanese invasion of Shanghai and the atmosphere of terror in the city, on January 24, they signed a water meter contract with the Municipal Council. The water fee was 62.5 cents in silver dollars per thousand gallons, divided into four levels: 2,000 gallons, 3,000 gallons, 5,000 gallons, and 10,000 gallons. Amounts less than 1,000 gallons were also counted as 1,000 gallons, and amounts above 5,000 gallons were all counted as 10,000 gallons. Moreover, only a master meter was installed in the lane houses, so the effect of controlling waste was not achieved, and the water fee was several times higher than before, even exceeding the amount of rent. Therefore, the landlords who collected water fees from the users on behalf of the water company were deeply shocked and</p>
<h3>Rose Up in Opposition</h3>
<p>After repeated appeals from our association to the Municipal Council, a discount method was finally determined, that is, 6% of the rent plus one-quarter, plus one-third of the sum of the two. In other words, at least 10% of the rent must be charged for water fees after the installation of meters. In this way, the water fee has doubled in the past four or five years compared to the original 5%. The increase due to the increase in rent is not included. Our association cannot agree with this discount increase method for</p>
<h3>Two Reasons:</h3>
<p>(1) When the surcharge was increased, the reply from Mr. Beeson, the general manager of the company, stated that this surcharge was sufficient to cover all expenses. (2) Increasing the water fees for poor and small households by installing water meters is inconsistent with the spirit of Mr. Hill's report and fails to achieve the purpose of controlling waste. Therefore, it was decided to temporarily pay the 7.5% water fee first, and the remainder would be handled after the Municipal Council, the company, and our association jointly determined a legal, reasonable, practical, and easy-to-implement method. However, the company repeatedly refused to accept this payment and, while the Municipal Council's Public Utilities Committee and the Board of Directors were discussing the case, suddenly resorted to cutting off water pipes, a life-threatening</p>
<h3>Means of Oppression.</h3>
<p>Currently, tens of thousands of people are being cut off from drinking water, which is heartbreaking to speak of and infuriating to hear. The increase in water fees places an unbearable burden on real estate operators, so the mortgages used for land rents and interest payments will be difficult to cover, which has a significant indirect relationship with the banking industry. If it is imposed on users, then the livelihood of the common people and laborers must bear huge water fees, and their cost of living will be even higher, which also has a non-negligible indirect relationship with the industrial and commercial sectors. Our association has limited capabilities and has been struggling until now, and is already exhausted. We have always admired your association as the leader of all industries, and its interests are actually closely related. Therefore, we are especially presenting this detailed report, and we urge you to provide strong assistance and express your opinion before the Municipal Council meeting this Wednesday. This is a matter of life and death, and preserving the situation is of utmost importance. We eagerly anticipate this.</p>
<h3>Municipal Council Side</h3>
<p>The Public Concession Municipal Council also conducted a brief study of the water case at yesterday's regular meeting of the Board of Directors, but no decision was made. According to a spokesperson who told a *New Life News* reporter, the Board of Directors discussed the matter yesterday, but there was no formal discussion. Therefore, after private contacts, there is now hope of resolving it in the shortest possible time. Although the details of the nearly resolved matter cannot be disclosed at this time, it is indicated that the company side seems to have the possibility of compromise.</p>
<h3>Letter from the City Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>Regarding the water company's water cutoff, the City Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Municipal Council yesterday, requesting a strict order to restore the water supply. The original letter reads: "To the esteemed: Water is essential for human life, and the amount used does not initially vary based on wealth. Since 1928, water fees have increased from 5% to 6% of the rent, and then an additional surcharge has been added, totaling 7.5%. Public opinion has long been critical of these circumstances, especially the distribution of reserve funds to shareholders in the form of bonus shares, increasing interest guarantees, and passing the burden on to users, which is considered unfair by public opinion. The company is merely trying to find ways to increase its profits and has never considered the interests of the public. Later, Mr. Hill came to Shanghai to investigate, and his report discussed both changing the capital to silver and installing water meters, and especially emphasized that the burden on poor and small households should not be increased. However, the water company only adopted the installation of water meters, and its pricing standards and grouping calculation methods are absolutely contrary to the interests of poor and small households. Therefore, the water fees have increased several times compared to before, even exceeding the total amount of rent. The company sets its own regulations and implements them itself. If users have any objections, they resort to cutting off the water supply as a means of coercion. This is reasonable in other types of trade, because buying and selling must be voluntary, and customers have plenty of choices. As for using this coercive method in a monopolistic business, the goods are essential for human life and cannot be lacking for even a day, even more important than rice. This is simply placing the people in a position of death. Your bureau, based on its authority and reasoning, must not take a laissez-faire attitude towards the company again, failing the trust of the citizens, and making the general public suspect that the company's actions are condoned by your bureau. We should first strictly order the restoration of the water supply to maintain the lives of the citizens. As for the water price issue, we should accommodate the opinions of the Real Estate Association and the Taxpaying Chinese Association and promptly find a fair and reasonable solution. This is our utmost expectation. To the Public Concession Municipal Council."</p>
<h3>Letter from the City United Association</h3>
<p>The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' United Association sent a letter to the Public Concession Municipal Council yesterday, stating: "To the esteemed: It is the common understanding of all countries in the world that municipal authorities should be responsible for providing citizens with affordable and clean water. The responsible personnel of your bureau are all bathed in civilization and should be aware of this principle. However, allowing the water company to guarantee 9% interest, allowing the water company to enjoy the exchange rate surplus, not allowing users to enjoy it, and requiring users to bear the losses, and allowing the company to issue bonus shares from the past large reserve funds, turning assets into liabilities, thereby increasing users' water fees, is already disregarding the interests of the citizens and fulfilling the water company's exploitation. Recently, the installation of water meters, ostensibly to prevent waste, is actually a means of increasing fees. Yong'an Company paid the initial water meter bills in full, and after the Shanghai Real Estate Association opposed it, the water company voluntarily requested a reduction in water fees. After approval, the reduction was to 6% plus a surcharge, which was privately increased by 20%, totaling 10% of the rent. We ask, what is the reason for adding this one-third? Is it a meter fee, or a handling fee for preventing waste? What kind of scientific method was used to calculate it? The water company also does not reflect on itself and cuts off water to coerce payment, so that your bureau is unable to maintain the supply of water to the citizens, which is extremely regrettable. Correspondingly, we request your bureau to use the powers entrusted to it by the citizens to promptly stop this and immediately open the water supply to the citizens within the boundary, who will be the rearguard."</p>
<h3>Kong Xiangxi Departs for Home</h3>
<p>Arriving in Shanghai Next Tuesday</p>
<p>Our country's special envoy for industry, Kong Xiangxi, has completed his mission of inspecting Europe and the United States and is now returning home. He is expected to arrive in Shanghai next Tuesday. The details are as follows:</p>

<h3>川江外輪聯合跌價</h3>
<p>To Counteract Chinese Steamships</p>
<p>The unity of Chinese steamships on the Sichuan River and competition in shipping has been reported previously.  Foreign steamship merchants from British and American firms in Shanghai, specifically responding to the reduction of freight rates by Chinese steamships, convened an emergency meeting yesterday to discuss strategies to reduce freight rates and counteract the Chinese steamships. Detailed information will be reported as follows:</p>
<p>Falling Prices:  Last summer, during the flood season on the upper Yangtze River, foreign steamships of British firms Butterfield &amp; Swire (太古) and Jardine Matheson (怡和), and the American firm Standard Oil (捷江), repeatedly and drastically reduced the cost of shipping cotton yarn from Shanghai to Chongqing in order to compete for the Sichuan River shipping business.  The price was reduced to a mere eight taels of silver per piece.  In reality, this freight rate was far below cost.  The foreign merchants endured the price drop in the hope of making it impossible for the Chinese steamships to sustain themselves.  The Chinese steamships suffered a blow from this, with some gradually suspending operations.  However, the losses suffered by the foreign steamships were also substantial.</p>
<p>Joint Price Increase: During the time the freight rates were being reduced, the Chinese Xin Lun Ju (新輪局) and Minsheng Company (民生司) were established. After the Chinese steamships on the Sichuan River suffered this blow and suspended operations one after another, Butterfield &amp; Swire, Jardine Matheson, Standard Oil and Minsheng Company (which was also joined at this time, forming a partnership of four companies) jointly and significantly increased the freight rates. At this time, many Chinese steamships had ceased operations. Merchants had to transport goods on foreign steamships. As a result, cotton yarn freight rates suddenly increased by more than double. The set price for direct transport from Shanghai to Chongqing was twenty-one taels per piece, and the price for transshipment from Yichang to Chongqing was nineteen taels per piece.</p>
<p>Operating Vessels: Since the cessation of shipping by Japanese vessels on the Sichuan River, Butterfield &amp; Swire dispatched three ships, Jardine Matheson dispatched two ships, and Standard Oil also dispatched three ships. These ships traveled between Shanghai and Chongqing, and from Yichang to Chongqing. The three foreign merchants also dispatched more than ten ships between Hankou and Yichang. Minsheng Company has a total of eight steamships. Four ships travel between Shanghai and Chongqing. The other four ships travel between Hankou and Yichang. As for the Chinese steamships on the upper river, only four companies, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (招商), Sanbei (三北), Fuyuan (福源), and Guangyao (光耀), remained after being squeezed out by foreign steamships last year. Their influence was extremely small.</p>
<p>Chinese Ships Reduce Prices: This time, the water level on the upper river gradually rose. Large steamships on the Chongqing and Yichang routes resumed operations. Fuyuan Company, one of the Chinese steamship companies, first reduced cotton yarn freight rates on the upper river to reduce the price by two taels of silver per piece to compete for shipments from Shanghai. Sanbei and other ships also reduced prices one after another to compete with foreign steamships for cargo. This provoked a price reduction boycott from foreign merchants.</p>
<p>Foreign Merchants Reduce Prices: The foreign merchants from British and American firms in Shanghai heard the news that the Chinese steamships on the upper river had jointly reduced prices. Consequently, Butterfield &amp; Swire, Jardine Matheson, Standard Oil, and Minsheng Company convened an emergency meeting yesterday at the Standard Oil Company building. Representatives from the four companies attended the meeting. They decided that as the water was about to rise and the outflow of goods from the lower reaches would begin, and since the Chinese steamships had reduced prices, the four companies would remain united and immediately follow suit. The freight rate for cotton yarn transported from Shanghai to Chongqing would be reduced uniformly from today. The direct freight rate from Shanghai to Chongqing was reduced to sixteen taels, and the freight rate for transshipment from Yichang was reduced to fourteen taels. The price was reduced by five taels from the original set price and would be implemented from today.</p>
<h3>Minsheng Company Spokesman Discusses the Consistent Cooperation between Chinese and Foreign Steamships on the Sichuan River</h3>
<p>Shen Shi Telegraph Agency, local news.  A reporter, due to a previous report about the great unity of Chinese steamships on the Sichuan River resisting the monopolistic attack by foreign steamships, which attracted the attention of the Chinese and foreign shipping industry, specially visited a responsible person of Minsheng Company in Shanghai yesterday to inquire about the truth. According to the person:</p>
<h3>Minsheng Company</h3>
<p>The principals in Chongqing, Shanghai, and Hankou have always had deep friendships with the [China Merchants] [Sanbei] and other companies, but in business, they each work for their own interests and do not communicate with each other. There is neither the motive nor the necessity for an alliance. As for [Jiajiang Yu (浹江榆)], it is a small customs brokerage and does not have steamships operating on the Sichuan River. According to shipping statistics over the years, there is also no so-called [Yongxing (永興)] steamship sailing on the upper Yangtze River. Furthermore, the Sichuan River has</p>
<h3>Little Cargo and Many Ships</h3>
<p>Freight rates are extremely low. Therefore, all Chinese and foreign steamship companies suffer losses when shipping goods. If no remedy is sought in the long term, free competition will inevitably occur again. Chinese and foreign shipping merchants, aware of this, unanimously advocated increasing freight rates last winter. This was not an original idea of any one party. Also, the recent price reduction was facilitated by the mutual agreement of Chinese and foreign parties. This is a phenomenon that should occur when the spring waters rise. It is not a solo action by anyone trying to benefit from it. Thus, it can be seen that the solidarity and cooperation between Chinese and foreign companies has been consistent. Moreover, Minsheng Company's</p>
<h3>Shipping Development</h3>
<p>Plan has now come to an end. In the next few years, it plans to temporarily not add new ships and concentrate all efforts on the development of internal industries in Sichuan, such as establishing hydroelectric power plants, cement plants, coking coal plants, and other projects. It is unwilling to engage in meaningless competition with foreign merchants and destroy the foundation it has just built.</p>
<h3>He Bingxian Reports on the Termination of Participation in the Chicago Exposition by Order</h3>
<p>丨Responsible for Returning All Exhibits丨</p>
<p>He Bingxian, chairman of the Standing Committee of the Preparatory Committee for Participation in the Chicago Exposition, told a Central News Agency reporter yesterday morning that in February of the 19th year of the Republic of China [1930], the American envoy sent a note to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs inviting China to participate in the Chicago Exposition. In March of the 20th year [1931], the Executive Yuan decided to participate at its 16th meeting. Last June, the preparatory committee was established and began preparatory work. In the past six months, thanks to the enthusiastic promotion of authorities in various provinces and cities and the enthusiastic cooperation of merchants and people from all walks of life, various preparatory matters, such as the collection of exhibits from various regions and the design of the special pavilion, have been completed. Now, the government, due to the deepening national crisis and the emergency in Rehe Province, has decided to stop participating. There is a compelling reason. This time, the exhibitors from various provinces and cities spent a lot of money and time preparing the exhibits. The items currently displayed at the exhibit exhibition are mostly high-quality products that can demonstrate China's progress over the past century and are praised by all sectors. There are still exhibits from other remote provinces arriving. Now that the government has decided not to participate in the Chicago Exposition, the exhibitors will inevitably suffer considerable losses in terms of money and time. However, thinking of the current national crisis, the power of the entire nation should be concentrated externally. Spiritually, we should be more motivated and work hard for the country. The purpose of participating in the Chicago Exposition was to promote foreign trade and express Sino-American friendship. In the past six months, during a time of national crisis, China has spent a lot of effort preparing for participation, especially merchants, who have been enthusiastic. This shows the goodwill of the Chinese government and people towards the United States. Now, China has had to stop participating halfway due to the severity of the national crisis. Friendly governments and people should be able to understand and express sympathy. Now, this committee has received orders from the State Council to handle the termination. All exhibits from the exhibitors will be returned with due care.</p>

<h3>Large Reflecting Telescope Shipped from Germany to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Installed at the Zijinshan Astronomical Observatory in Nanjing</p>
<p>Da Mei Evening News reports that the twenty-four-inch reflecting telescope manufactured by the Carl Zeiss factory in Germany for the Astronomical Institute of the Academia Sinica of China recently arrived in Shanghai from Germany and has already been transferred to Nanjing. It will be installed at the Zijinshan Astronomical Observatory after the construction of the observatory is completed. This telescope is not only the largest in China, but also one of the best in the Far East. Its cost is over 120,000 marks. Its main purpose is to study celestial bodies through photography and self-recording spectroscopy. The main body of the telescope is a large barrel with a silver-plated parabolic glass mirror with a diameter of twenty-four inches and a focal length of ten feet at the bottom. At the top is a small plane mirror that is inclined at forty-five degrees to the visual axis, so that the image formed by the focal point of the large mirror can be reflected laterally for direct viewing. However, this plane mirror can also be replaced by a similar concave mirror, so that the image formed by the reflected focal point passes through the small hole in the center of the large clock and reaches behind the mirror, allowing the observer to observe next to the large barrel at the bottom of the clock cylinder. Beside the large barrel is a small barrel with a lens with a diameter of eight inches and a focal length of ten feet. Using this small barrel, the observer can align the large barrel with a star when photographing and follow the movement of the celestial body for several hours without error. To make the barrel move with the celestial body, the most accurate electrical machinery is used. Whenever photographing, the observer can use a very precise electrical movement instrument to correct slight errors in the barrel's movement. However, the innovation of this telescope lies in a clever design that allows the observer to sit comfortably on a stool and use mechanical lifting to move to the top or bottom of the barrel as desired, without unnecessary effort. In addition to this telescope, the Astronomical Institute has also purchased many other astronomical instruments, such as an eight-inch equatorial refracting telescope, equipped with a six-inch astronomical camera, a five-and-a-half-inch meridian circle, equipped with a sophisticated micrometer, a four-inch Ross camera, a Hale solar spectroscope, and a Schulte free pendulum, all of which are more important. It is expected that the institute will start a complete research program after the observatory is completed, including three major studies that will collaborate with astronomical observatories around the world. One is the world's longitude measurement, which will be held this fall. The second is the observation of solar activity, especially focusing on the relationship between the Earth's magnetic poles and solar activity. The third is the study of short-period stars. These studies require simultaneous worldwide performance. At present, there are very few complete astronomical observatories in the Far East. It is anticipated that this institute will play an important role in the world's collaborative research on celestial phenomena in the future, relying on precise instruments.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Reduces and Exempts Farmland Tax in Disaster Areas</h3>
<p>Three Bureaus Jointly Prepare a List of Amounts with Official Seals</p>
<p>Over 197,052 Yuan</p>
<p>The case of the reduction and exemption of farmland tax in disaster areas of this city for the 21st year of the Republic of China [1932] was resolved by the 208th municipal meeting in July of last year, with five measures ordered for compliance by the Land, Finance, and Social Affairs Bureaus, and filed with the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Finance for the record. This was reported in various newspapers earlier. Later, the municipal government approved the orders from the two ministries stating that the measures for the reduction and exemption of farmland tax in disaster areas should be submitted to the ministry for the record after the "Measures for Separate Reporting of Disaster Relief" were revised and then forwarded for review. The communication requested that the survey conditions, the land area of the disaster areas, and the number of exemptions to be made be compiled into a register and submitted to the ministry for review. The municipal government first revised the "Measures for Reporting Disaster Relief" and submitted them to the ministry for the record. Recently, the Land, Finance, and Social Affairs Bureaus were ordered to prepare a register, which has been forwarded to the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Finance for the record. The amounts listed in the jointly prepared register with official seals from the three bureaus are extracted below. Upon investigation, the regular silver amount (忙銀) for this city in the 21st year is nominally 69,392 taels, 1 mace, 8 candareens, and 2 cash, which is equivalent to 276,463 yuan, 3 jiao, and 3 fen, including surtax, handling fees, and municipal expenses. Subtract the 20,469 taels, 2 mace, and 3 cash of regular silver exempted for military disasters in this year, which is equivalent to 85,071 yuan, 5 jiao, and 8 fen, including surtax, handling fees, and municipal expenses. Also, subtract 14,440 taels, 7 mace, and 1 candareen of silver carried over from the 20th year due to flooding, which is equivalent to 57,880 yuan, 3 jiao, and 7 fen, including surtax, handling fees, and municipal expenses. The amount of premium rice (精米) collected is 37,638 dan, 2 dou, 1 sheng, 7 he, and 2 shao, which is equivalent to 148,215 yuan, 8 jiao, and 3 fen, including surtax, handling fees, and municipal expenses. Also, subtract 6,596 dan, 1 dou, 5 sheng, 6 he, and 4 shao of premium rice exempted for military disasters in this year, which is equivalent to 54,197 yuan, 1 jiao, and 8 fen, including surtax, handling fees, and municipal expenses. In total, the reduction and exemption of regular silver for this city in the 21st year amounts to 197,252 yuan, 4 jiao, and 9 fen. The taxable amount of regular silver after the reduction and exemption is 327,526 yuan, 6 jiao, and 7 fen.</p>
<h3>Party and Government Discuss the Rice Merchants' Strike Yesterday</h3>
<p>Re-examine All Measuring Instruments on a Fixed Date</p>
<p>The rice merchants in the southern district of Shanghai declared a strike on the 20th of last month due to the use of heavy measures by the measure office (斛司). The party and government agencies have already taken measures to manage the merchants. However, because the issue is complex, no results have been achieved. The Social Affairs Bureau specially convened relevant food groups yesterday to hold a meeting to discuss the issue. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Attending Representatives</h3>
<p>Due to the rice merchants' strike, which is related to the people's food supply, the party and government agencies specially convened a meeting of various rice industry groups at the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday morning at 10 a.m. Representatives from the city party headquarters, including He Yuanming, and from the Social Affairs Bureau, including Zhang Binghui, Wu Hengru, and Zhou Minggang, and from the Shanghai Southern District Rice Merchants Joint Association, including Lian Yi and Chen Zhiqiang, and from the Shanghai Northern District Rice Merchants Joint Association, including Jiang Shizhi, and from the Old Rice Industry Association, including Gu Xinyi and Zhang Songtao, and from the Rice Store Association, including Lu Wenshao and Sun Zhendong, and from the Rice Milling Industry Association, including Zhu Zixiang, and from the Old Rice Office, including Yan Xiaoquan, and from the Measure Office Union, including Hua Longxiang, and from the Bureau of Weights and Measures Inspection, including Zuan Zanming, and more than twenty other people attended. Zhang Binghui presided over the meeting, and Zhou Minggang served as the recorder.</p>
<h3>Chairman's Report</h3>
<p>First, Chairman Zhang Binghui gave a report, stating that the Shanghai Southern District Rice Merchants Joint Association requested the use of level measures and funnels, which was discussed at a meeting on December 29 of last year. At that time, it was resolved that a proper method would be negotiated after the implementation of the new measuring instruments. Now, the various rice industries in this city have implemented the new measuring instruments. However, the Shanghai Southern District Rice Merchants Joint Association suddenly declared a strike on the 20th of last month, without reporting before or after the event. The bureau, in consideration of the merchants' difficulties, did not take any measures to suppress them. According to recent investigation reports, there have also been instances of obstructing rice boats from opening to Shanghai. If this is indeed the case, it is a violation of law and discipline. To discuss how to avoid disputes over rice measures, three methods have been proposed: eliminating heavy measures, using level measures and funnels, and using scales. These methods will be carefully studied to achieve a fair resolution between rice merchants and rice stores. In this time of national crisis, internal unity should be maintained. These minor issues should be resolved harmoniously. Extreme measures should not be taken to create social unrest. It is hoped that a proper method can be reached today to resolve the dispute, and so on.</p>
<h3>Revised Measures</h3>
<p>The discussion then began. Representatives from the relevant groups expressed their opinions. The representatives from the Shanghai Southern and Northern District Rice Merchants Joint Association still requested the use of level measures and funnels to avoid hidden losses. Representatives from the bean and rice industries also proposed abolishing measures and using scales. The rice stores still insisted that the old system could not be abolished. The parties argued for a long time, and no official results were achieved. At 1:25 p.m., the chairman announced that a decision was made to re-examine all measuring instruments in detail on a fixed date. The results will be used to revise the measures, and the groups will be asked to hold a meeting to decide.</p>
<h3>Measure Office Opinions</h3>
<p>The Measure Office Union held a meeting yesterday afternoon after the meeting at the Social Affairs Bureau. Because the representatives of the rice stores arbitrarily attacked and proposed the use of scales, disregarding the livelihood of the Measure Office, they held a meeting at 5 p.m. yesterday afternoon. More than thirty Measure Office members attended, chaired by Hua Longxiang. After public discussion, it was resolved that they would collectively oppose the use of scales and plan to request government relief.</p>
<h3>Feng Xuefen Reports on the Disaster Situation in Rehe Province</h3>
<p>Relief Workers Headed to Kailu and Other Places are Still Delayed En Route</p>
<p>The Shanghai Charity Organizations Joint Association for Relief of Northeastern Refugees received a letter yesterday from Feng Xuefen (仰山), the representative for investigation and relief heading north, from Ping. Feng reported that since arriving in Ping, he had made many inquiries about the disaster situation in Rehe Province. Based on the investigation, he is submitting a report for review. It is found that Rehe Province has an area of about 580,000 square miles and is divided into more than twenty counties, including Kailu. It has a population of over 3.8 million. It is located on the border and has mostly sandy soil. Food is scarce, and livestock is abundant. In recent years, natural disasters and man-made disasters have come one after another. Last spring, defeated soldiers from various Northeastern armies and various righteous armies disturbed the area in teams. Bandits took the opportunity to rise up and looting was rampant. Unexpectedly, the heavens did not bless them and brought another year of disaster. Last year, floods caused damage, and this summer, there was a severe drought. In July, it also suffered hailstorms. At harvest time, there was incessant rain, causing the remaining crops to rot and become unusable. The autumn harvest is hopeless, and there is no harvest at all. This year, military tensions have risen, and large armies are pressing on the border, consuming all the grain, grass, cattle, and horses accumulated by the farmers. Even the people's clothes have been looted. From the dead of winter to the cold of spring, the suffering compatriots have no clothes or food. Their lives hang by a thread. Therefore, the strong often take risks, while the old and weak sit and wait for death. Some abandon their families and take their relatives with them to flee, while others form groups to seek food. Their faces are dirty, their feet are bare, and they roam the roads. Cries of hunger and cold can be heard everywhere. Zheng Xia's paintings of refugees cannot describe even a fraction of the suffering. Spring plowing is hopeless, and the entire year's food supply for the people has been cut off. It is heartbreaking to hear and tearful to speak of. How can the remaining people endure this? Representatives have been sent with relief funds to Kailu, Xiawa, Suidong, and other counties with severe disasters for a trial relief effort. If extensive relief can be provided, further efforts will be made. Others have been assigned to go to Suiyuan and Datong to purchase grain for use. However, long-distance transportation to Rehe is very difficult, and there is a risk of accidental loss. This has been detailed in the letter of the 21st. However, the association's relief funds are limited, while the disaster area is vast and the number of disaster victims is large. A drop in the bucket cannot solve the problem. Please, fellow members, show great compassion and raise more relief funds to rescue these millions of helpless disaster victims from the depths of suffering and register them. I await orders with utmost urgency.</p>
<p>The association also received a telegram yesterday from Feng Juncan (on the 28th) reporting that the relief workers headed to Kailu, Xiawa, and Suidong were delayed en route due to the war. They first purchased 1,000 shi of millet in Datong and Suiyuan at 12.4 yuan per shi and are trying to transport it.</p>
<h3>Clearing House Announces Exchange Volume Daily</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Bankers Association Clearing House, established on January 14 of this year, has fully implemented the exchange of instruments for four currencies: silver dollars, exchange of silver dollars, silver taels, and exchange of silver taels, from yesterday. From now on, the total daily exchange volume will be the exact amount of all checks settled mutually by all exchange banks each day. This is quite important in terms of financial statistics. The clearing house has decided to list the total daily exchange volume and send it to the New Sound News Agency for publication every evening, starting yesterday. Yesterday was the first day of publication, and the numbers are as follows: (1) Silver dollars: 1,913,580 yuan and 1 fen. Exchange of silver dollars: 440,838 yuan, 7 jiao, and 2 fen. Silver taels: 10,974,178 taels and 8 fen. Exchange of silver taels: 726,327 taels and 4 qian and 7 fen. The total equivalent to silver dollars is 18,718,762 yuan, 1 jiao, and 6 fen. The amount of silver taels and exchange of silver taels in the total amount is converted to silver dollars at a rate of 0.715.</p>
<h3>Minutes of the Executive Committee Meeting of the Journalists Association</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Journalists Association held an executive committee meeting yesterday afternoon. The committee members present were Yu Kongwo, Zhao Junhao, Qian Cangyun, Jin Huating, Ma Chonggan, Qu Shaoyi, Zhu Chaoran, Du Gang, Sun Daosheng, and Yan Esheng. Qu Chaoyi presided over the meeting, and the following resolutions were passed: (1) Gu Zhizhong, the convener of the Job Security Research Committee, has left Shanghai. Qian Cangshuo was appointed to replace him. (2) The Shishi Xinbao newspaper replied that the investigation of the murder and the compensation in the case of Wang Weisan have been submitted to the authorities separately and are being handled by the newspaper in accordance with the rules. The letter has been transcribed and forwarded to Mrs. Wang Weisan.</p>
<h3>Various Groups Protest the Incident of Arrest and Shooting by Foreign Police</h3>
<h3>Chinese Ratepayers Association of the Shanghai Municipal Council</h3>
<p>The Chinese Ratepayers Association of the Shanghai Municipal Council sent a letter to the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the French Concession, agreeing to actively protest the incident of arrest and shooting on Xinqiao Street, which resulted in multiple casualties, and expressing its willingness to provide support. The original letter stated: "Dear Sirs, on February 26, at around 2 p.m., in the second special district on Xinqiao Street, a foreign police officer interfered with two women riding in a rickshaw and opened fire without cause, resulting in multiple casualties. This association highly admires your association's active protest to protect the safety of citizens. Considering that we are in the same position, we should follow suit. We are sending this letter and request that you review it to strengthen our public friendship." This letter was addressed to the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the French Concession of Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Chaozhou Fellow-Countrymen Association</h3>
<p>The tragic incident of a foreign police officer shooting and killing passersby on Xinqiao Street in the French Concession of this city has caused extreme outrage among the citizens. Since the Chaozhou Fellow-Countrymen Association of Shanghai established a committee to assist Zhu Guting, a fellow townsman who was killed, it has held meetings in recent days and made many important resolutions. Yesterday afternoon at 3 p.m., another meeting was held at the association's headquarters. More than 50 people attended. First, Chairman Zheng Zhengqiu reported, stating that the meaning of this case is very significant. It is not only about assisting a fellow townsman who was killed but also about the safety of all residents in the concession. If it is not fundamentally improved, the future will be dangerous. Therefore, in addition to appealing to party and government agencies, the association has also joined with various sectors to jointly organize a support association for the tragic incident to unite and support. Because the concessions have not been recovered in this city, police power has fallen into the hands of foreigners. Especially foreign police officers do not understand the language or the local customs, which often leads to unfortunate events. The purpose of this negotiation is not only limited to punishing the perpetrators and providing compensation but also to pay attention to future guarantees and fundamental remedies. Next, the resolutions were discussed and it was decided: (1) to appoint Zheng Yingshi, Zheng Shixiong, Zhang Xutang, and Guo Qiming as liaison members, and Huang Tianpeng, Zheng Meian, Chen Tingchao, and Zhou Fanglong as publicity members; (2) to send a letter to the Chaozhou Guild Hall requesting that it send representatives to the meeting; (3) to send a letter to the French Concession Commercial Road Joint Association requesting its earnest assistance; (4) to appoint Zheng Zhengqiu and Guo Qiming to participate in the meeting of the Guangdong Fellow-Countrymen Association of Shanghai; (5) to appoint Zheng Yingshi and Zheng Shixiong to attend the meeting of the Ningbo Fellow-Countrymen Association.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Fellow-Countrymen Association</h3>
<p>The Ningbo Fellow-Countrymen Association of Shanghai specially organized the Liu Case Support Association for this case, with dedicated personnel to handle the matter. Jin Runxiang, Dai Zhenhuai, Yu Hualong, Ye Xianggao, Guo Zusheng, Wu Yayin, and Zhang Shenzhi were appointed as members. A meeting was held at 5 p.m. yesterday afternoon. Representatives from the Chaozhou Fellow-Countrymen Association of Shanghai, Zheng Yingshi, Guo Qiming, and Zheng Shixiong, attended. Zhang Shenzhi was elected as chairman. First, the chairman reported on the progress of handling the tragic case. It was also found that there were two other injured people at the time, one a fellow townsman from Changzhou who was injured in the wrist, and the other a fellow townsman from Pudong who was injured in the foot. Both injured people went to the hospital for treatment on their own. Next, it was resolved to send telegrams to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate with the French Ambassador to China and to request the municipal party headquarters to preside over the matter. A letter was also sent to the Changzhou and Pudong Fellow-Countrymen Associations to take unified action.</p>
<h3>Shanghai General Labor Union</h3>
<p>Sent a letter to the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the French Concession yesterday stating: "Dear Sirs, on February 25, a foreign police officer (束新橋街四二七號越捕) in front of the Ningbo Hotel on Xinqiao Street in the French Concession interfered with two women riding in a rickshaw and fired several shots indiscriminately at the crowd of onlookers, killing Zhu Guting on the spot and injuring Liu Fugao and two unidentified people. Liu Fugao later died from his serious injuries. Upon investigation, since the occurrence of this case, public sentiment has been aroused to the extreme. Everyone believes that the actions of the foreign police officer are not only inhumane but also an abuse of power and a violation of the law, intentionally killing people. If we do not fight for justice, the compatriots living in the French Concession will be in danger of being killed at any time. After careful consideration, this union can only request that your association negotiate strictly with the French authorities to ensure that the murderer is severely punished in accordance with the law, the families of the deceased are generously compensated, the injured are reimbursed for medical expenses, and that guarantees are given that similar incidents will not occur in the future, so as to value human life and ensure peaceful residence. We are awaiting your news with utmost anticipation." This letter was addressed to the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the French Concession.</p>
<h3>Postal Workers Union</h3>
<p>To the French Concession Chinese Taxpayers Association, the Shanghai Postal Workers Union writes: With utmost respect, we bring to your attention that on the 25th of February, at 1:45 PM, a shooting incident occurred in front of the Ningbo Restaurant on Rue du Consulat in the French Concession, where a foreign policeman shot and killed a passerby. Since the occurrence of this incident, people from all walks of life in society have felt outrage and indignation. At the beginning of the incident, the foreign policeman merely intervened in the matter of two women riding in a rickshaw, then suddenly he proceeded to indiscriminately fire live ammunition at unarmed crowds on the roadside, resulting in the immediate death of one person named Zhu Gu Ting, and the injury of one Liu Fu Gao, as well as two unidentified individuals. Liu Fu Gao died from his severe injuries due to lack of medical treatment. The disregard for human life by the foreign policeman is no different from the actions of the most savage among humankind. We believe your association is fully aware of the actual circumstances and the abuse of power by the policeman in question. However, we cannot help but express our concerns. If this case is not severely punished, then all residents living in the French Concession are at constant risk of being killed by armed police. Moreover, the purpose of us providing money to these police officers is for them to protect us. How could it turn into a disaster where we are killed instead? This is truly the most tragic thing in the world. Therefore, we request your association to promptly and vigorously negotiate with the French Concession Municipal Council to severely punish the murderer, provide generous compensation to the bereaved families, and guarantee that similar incidents will not occur again in the future. This will be extremely fortunate, as it will value human lives and provide protection. Respectfully, the Shanghai Postal Workers Union, March 1st.</p>
<p>Notification: (3) Spring Member Assembly. It has been decided to convene the assembly on March 18th. A public notice should be placed in the newspapers starting from March 4th, and a special letter should be sent to notify all members. (4) The membership procedures for Shi Bo Ting and three others are incomplete. The decision awaits the Joint Meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees. (5) It is scheduled to hold a Joint Meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees on February 8th (Wednesday) at 5 PM. (6) The preparatory committee for the General Assembly will be formed. The candidates will be nominated by the Joint Meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees.</p>
<h3>Japanese Consulate General Deliberately Acts Calm, Claiming Chinese Newspaper is Spreading Rumors</h3>
<p>One day, the Japanese Shanghai Daily reported that the Japanese Consulate General authorities, regarding the Japanese expatriate news published in the Chinese newspapers in the city on the 28th, such as "Early News," "News," "Times," "Current Affairs News," stating that "Japanese residents in Suzhou and other areas along the Yangtze River have received orders from Japanese officials to prepare to withdraw," issued the following statement: "Such reports in Chinese newspapers are completely false and fabricated and are not credible. The situation in various places is no different from usual, and there is no movement of any kind, so there is no cause for concern," etc.</p>
<p>###济生會上年振務報告</p>
<h3>Jisieng Hui Last Year Disaster Relief Report</h3>
<p>The Chinese Jisieng Hui held a meeting the day before yesterday to report on its disaster relief efforts for the past year. Those present at the meeting included Chairman Yu Yiting, Vice Chairmen Xu Qianlin, Huang Qiangzhi, Director of Disaster Relief Supervision Qu Liuwen, Zhu Qichen, Zhang Xianqing, and dozens of other committee members. A Mr. X, the director of disaster relief, reported that from January 1, 1932, to the end of the year, the association's total disaster relief funds paid to various provinces amounted to more than 400,200 yuan. Outstanding debts were listed separately in the annual financial statement, which was read and passed by Hua Feng and Wei Yangshan. It was also mentioned that colleagues Qu Weiwen and Feng Wei Yangshan were highly praised for their efforts in handling the disaster relief efforts in the Northeast. No matter how difficult things were for the association, in addition to the previous allocation, it was hoped that another 9,000 yuan could be raised to do their best. Currently, 300 sets of large and small cotton-padded clothes and 10,000 bottles of double-strength Jisieng pills were being transported to Tianjin and handed over to Feng Wei Yangshan for distribution to impoverished, sick, and disaster-stricken people, after careful consideration and selection. Winter relief efforts in this city and in the two weirs of Dayou and Fuyou in Jiangxi had been completed, and the reports were on file. Relief efforts in Guangfeng Weir, to which the association had sent personnel, were now underway and were approved by the public. A Mr. X proposed that, due to the decline of commerce, the worsening of rural conditions, the vast areas of red earth in the Northwest, and the presence of starving people everywhere, and the intensifying artillery fire and flying flesh and blood in the Northeast, it was truly heartbreaking to think about. Fellow comrades should embrace compassionate vows, patriotic zeal, and discuss how to expand relief efforts. Everyone was moved by Mr. X's proposal and each took on responsibilities and tried their best to find ways.</p>
<h3>Donations to Volunteer Army Initiated by Vocational Guidance Center</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Vocational Guidance Center of the China Vocational Education Society, recently recognizing the urgency of the situation in Northeast China and the prolonged resistance of the Volunteer Army, whose supplies and equipment were sometimes inadequate, initiated a campaign to gather a large number of comrades and contribute to the Volunteer Army to fight for the nation's survival and the people's dignity. Within a few days of the launch, there was a great response from all sides, especially from those who had been successfully introduced by the center to jobs. It was reported that Yu Gongpo, Long Chunpo, and Lu Desheng, three gentlemen who had been introduced by the center to work as low-level clerks at the China Insurance Company, raised 15.80 yuan. Lu Chengliang, who was introduced by the center to work as a laborer at the Municipal People's Education Center, and Song Jialu, who was introduced to work as an apprentice at the Shanghai Bakelite Factory, each donated one yuan. Even workers and apprentices were so enthusiastic about contributing, which is truly shameful for those who are wealthy but stingy. Once a certain amount has been collected, the society will remit it to a reliable fundraising organization and disclose the names in the society's monthly report.</p>

<h3>Cross-Boundary Telephone Surcharges Agreed Upon in Meeting Between Two Concession Authorities</h3>
<p>Municipal Government Fees to be Borne Solely by Public Concession</p>
<p>Formal Contract Signing Imminent, Notification to Follow</p>
<p>The issue of cross-boundary telephone surcharges has been carefully negotiated to reach concrete solutions, with both parties expressing satisfaction. Just as the contract was about to be signed, the French Concession authorities expressed disagreement, claiming that the bearing of fees for cross-boundary internal phone machines was unfair, leading to the contract being put on hold. According to a person in charge of the Public Utilities Bureau speaking to the Da Bai News Agency yesterday, the reasons are not detailed in the newspaper reports. The focus of the French Concession's opposition is due to the stipulation in the contract that the concession telephone company must subsidize the Chinese Telephone Bureau for each telephone in the cross-boundary area, at a rate of 30 yuan in western Shanghai, 12 yuan along the roads in northern Shanghai, and 60 yuan in areas not along the roads in northern Shanghai, and also pay the municipal government 10,000 yuan per year. When the contract was about to be signed, the concession telephone company, in its budget for the next fiscal year, included these two expenses in the general ledger, to be borne equally by both concessions. The French Concession considered the cross-boundary telephone issue to be a matter for the Public Concession, with no relation to the French Concession, and therefore did not recognize this obligation, which is a perfectly reasonable argument. It is now understood that the French Concession's response to the Public Concession acknowledges the bearing of subsidies for cross-boundary phone machines, but absolutely does not recognize the payment to the municipal government. Therefore, the Public Concession held a meeting yesterday (the 1st) afternoon to discuss the matter. It is said that it will agree to the French Concession's opinion, so that the internal knot between the two concessions can be resolved. In that case, the signing of the contract is not far off.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Strictly Prohibits Slaughter of Horses and Mules</h3>
<p>The municipal government of this city yesterday received a notice from the Ministry of Military Affairs, requesting that subordinate organizations be instructed to strictly prohibit the slaughter of horses and mules, and accordingly issued an order to the Health and Public Security Bureaus, stating: "To implement the order, according to a letter from the Ministry of Military Affairs, horses and mules are the only loyal animals among livestock and are the most beneficial to human society. The prosperity or decline of a country's horse production has a great impact on the economic productivity of agriculture, industry, and commerce, especially in terms of national defense preparations, where horses, equipment, and personnel are equally important. Therefore, all countries in the East and West take great care of horses and cherish them as they would their own lives, with beautiful names such as 'treasured horse' and 'beloved horse.' Our country has never paid attention to horse affairs, and the general public is unaware of the need to protect horses. Some unscrupulous merchants, driven by profit, are cruel and heartless, buying, selling, and slaughtering horses, causing a sharp decline in the number of horses in the country and a loss of balance in production. According to the results of a recent survey and statistics by the Ministry, in the past 20 years, the total number of horses produced in the country has decreased from 5 million to less than 1 million. If we do not promote protection and strictly prohibit slaughter, the species will be extinct in less than 10 years. The Ministry is deeply concerned about this and hereby requests your government to instruct its subordinate organizations and slaughterhouses to permanently prohibit the slaughter of livestock such as horses, mules, and donkeys. If there are any instances of illegal slaughter, they will be severely punished according to the law in order to protect them. Please investigate and handle this matter accordingly," etc. In addition to issuing separate orders and sending a reply, the bureau is hereby ordered to jointly investigate and prohibit all matters related to this order.</p>

<h3>Local Court Changes to Using Forensic Doctors</h3>
<p>One Coroner Removed</p>
<p>In all courts throughout China, the examination of injuries and corpses was originally conducted by "Wu Zuo" (仵作) in the Qing Dynasty. In the early years of the Republic of China, institutes for training inspectors were established in places such as Beijing and Hangzhou. A group of graduates filled the position of coroner in the current courts. The examination methods were still based on the "Washing Away of Wrongs" (洗冤錄), relying on personal experience and old methods for affirmation. In the past few years, this method was quite effective. For example, bone steaming and examination could not be done without the old-fashioned coroner. Therefore, for twenty years, they still held a considerable position. Now, however, science is flourishing. Dissection and chemical examination are beyond the scope of what a coroner can understand. Therefore, the Ministry of Justice specially established forensic examination institutes to train forensic talents and experience. Currently, forensic talents are emerging in large numbers, and the veterans of the coroner profession are gradually dying off. Therefore, it is gradually felt that the function of the coroner is not applicable to modern times. Therefore, the Ministry of Justice has recently issued a notice to the courts of all provinces to screen and eliminate the number of coroners and replace them with forensic doctors and elevate the status of forensic doctors. The Shanghai Local Court is the first to create this change. Yesterday, it removed one of the two coroners and appointed a forensic doctor as its backbone, with the coroner merely providing assistance. However, this will only be resolved after considering the experience and knowledge of both parties.</p>
<h3>Embezzled Funds Squandered on Opium</h3>
<p>Kaitai Inn on Sixth Road in the Public Concession, last night (28th)</p>
<p>Around 8 PM, a traveler named Lin Shifa, 28 years old and from Ningbo, who worked as a writer, checked into the inn. Later, he had thoughts of death and secretly consumed a heavy dose of opium. Around 11 AM the next morning, a waiter discovered the situation and urgently hired a car to send him to the Renji Hospital. The treatment was ineffective, and he died at around 5:30 PM yesterday afternoon. A suicide note was found in his pocket, with the envelope addressed to "A Bao, No. 20, Tongshengli, Hongqiao Xiatu." After the incident, the police ordered an investigator to summon A Bao to the scene. According to him, the deceased was actually Shi Xinggen, and Lin Shifa was a pseudonym. He resorted to this tactic because he had embezzled public funds from the foreign company to indulge in prostitution. It was his own fault, etc. The deceased was wearing a navy blue camel-hair robe, a gray woolen gown, melon-shaped hat, and rubber shoes.</p>
<h3>US Navy Automobile Accident Case from Four Years Ago</h3>
<p>Recently Submitted to the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee for Review</p>
<p>At the end of November 1929, a US Navy automobile collided with a tram in Jing'an Temple, causing passenger Cao Rongkuan to fall out of the tram and die from serious injuries. The family of Cao Rongkuan hired lawyer Gu Si to file a lawsuit with the Provisional Court of the Public Concession, seeking compensation and requesting the municipal government to protest to the US Consulate. Four years have passed without any news. It is now learned that the case was reported by the US Consulate to the US Embassy and then to the US government. After being passed by the House of Representatives, it has been submitted to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for review.

<h3>Two Lovers Seek Court Resolution to Affair</h3>
<p>Zuo Yuzhen In Love With Li Yazi</p>
<p>Surrendered to Authorities After Elopement</p>
<p>The girl from Nanjing, Ben Yuzhen, is 20 years old. After losing her mother at a young age, her father sent her to her aunt at No. 2 Kangning Lane, Avenue Joffre in the French Concession, entrusting her to raise her. It has been fifteen years now. Her aunt saw that Yuzhen had grown up and was quite beautiful, and was planning to find a suitable person for her to marry. However, her son, Mr. X, did not engage in proper work and associated with thugs. He planned to sell her for money. Yuzhen was greatly shocked when she heard about this. She secretly agreed with her lover, Li Yazi, to flee together. Li is 23 years old and from Taizhou, residing at No. 3 Kangning Lane, living next door to Yuzhen. They often visited each other and developed affection over time, leading to a romantic relationship. Upon learning of the news of being sold, she hastily fled her home with Li on the 12th of last month, staying together in a small inn in the French Concession. After drifting for more than twenty days, their expenses were high. Li, who was originally a rickshaw puller, quit his job after fleeing with Yuzhen, and loitered in the inn all day without making any progress. However, the expenses were heavy, and their finances became strained. Although Yuzhen swore to live and die together, he considered that if her family found them, he would not be able to avoid the crime of abducting a girl, and he feared that he would regret it later. Therefore, he explained the situation to Yuzhen and asked her to return home, promising to reunite when the opportunity arose. Unexpectedly, Yuzhen stubbornly refused and declared that since things had come to this, the die was cast. She would rather die than return home and was willing to follow him. Even if he became a beggar, she was willing to hold a begging bowl. Now that she was afraid of causing him trouble, she said that it was better to go to court as soon as possible, explain the reasons, help him escape punishment, and seek relief, etc. Li also agreed. So, at around 1 PM yesterday afternoon, they went together to the First District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau to request transfer to the court for investigation. When the district chief conducted a preliminary hearing, Zuo Yuzhen confessed the previous events and asked Li Yazi to state that he was willing to marry her if Zuo's family agreed. The director then ordered a formal report to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>
<h3>Accomplice in Assassination Case Sentenced to Life Imprisonment</h3>
<p>In 1929, Zhang Yuhong, a foreman at the Hefeng Factory in Pudong Bagatou, was assassinated. Two criminals, Bo Fugen and Xu Huaibao, were apprehended and sentenced, with Pan receiving the death penalty and Xu receiving life imprisonment. Both sentences have been carried out. However, Pan had previously stated that the mastermind was Sun Laosi from Jiangyin, and that Sun was about 37 or 38 years old at the time, tall, fat, and with a square face, etc. Therefore, the local court issued an arrest warrant. Sun Laosi was apprehended, but Sun denied it and used the alias Shen Asi, claiming to be from Yangzhou. However, after investigation by the court, it was found that Sun was now 42 years old, which matched the age of 37 or 38 in 1929. Sun was also tall, fat, and had a square face. During interrogation in the detention center, it was discovered that Sun spoke with a Jiangyin accent. Therefore, there was no way to evade the case, and the final arguments were concluded. Yesterday, Judge Yang Qianchang held a court session and announced the judgment. The reasons for the judgment were explained, and the main text of the judgment was read: Sun was sentenced to life imprisonment for jointly plotting murder, with deprivation of civil rights for life. He was advised that he should have been sentenced to death, but the sentence was reduced. If he was not satisfied, he could appeal. If he could prove that he was not Sun Laosi, then a verdict of innocent would also be pronounced. If he was still identified as Sun Laosi, then he feared that an appeal would result in the death penalty. However, Sun said that if the court sentenced him to death, he would accept it, but if he was sentenced to life imprisonment, he would not accept it. The official advised him that he could appeal. He was immediately returned to custody.</p>

<p>Reader Consultation</p>
<h3>A Response to Mr. Xu Xianfu's Letter on the Issue of Sports and Public Health</h3>
<p>Answer: Your letter eloquently discusses the problems of sports in China. Although your views may not be fully endorsed by us, your criticism of the weaknesses of the Chinese sports community is insightful. However, speaking from the facts, sports have nothing to do with farmers and workers. As for so-called "sports save the country," it is nothing more than similar slogans such as "art saves the country" and "recreation saves the country."</p>
<p>We agree with the two "remedy" suggestions you put forward, under the following conditions: (1) Military training should not be limited to students in cities but should be extended to the general public. (2) Some schools in the United States do not have a separate physical education class but focus on students' productive labor and services in school and community life. This kind of labor and service naturally produces the effect of exercise and is in line with the educational belief of "life is education, education is life." As for the health problems of the vast majority of people in China - farmers and workers - the solution lies not in sports but in the following issues: (1) How to relieve most farmers who are groaning and haggard under the burden of exorbitant taxes and usurious exploitation? (2) How to ensure that the [186,000,000 landless farmers] have land to till, so that they do not have to wander around and listen to us talk about hygiene and fitness on an empty stomach? (3) The excessive daily labor of urban workers exhausts their physical strength and prevents them from fully reproducing their labor power. Their lives are naturally shorter than ours. Moreover, their housing - the so-called slums - is worse than the pigsties of the rich and even worse than the kennels of the wealthy. Therefore, eight or nine out of ten workers have lung disease. What fundamental solutions can be taken? (4) Hundreds of thousands of unemployed workers are suffering from hunger and cold. They not only do not care about sports, but even if they do, they can only turn a deaf ear and walk away. How can we first ensure that they do not lose their jobs and go hungry? (5) [Shop assistants] in urban stores (this is a unique and serious problem in Shanghai and other major cities besides factory workers). They are confined to the market from morning to night, with no fresh air to breathe and no spare time to improve their physical and intellectual strength. How can we relieve them of this suffering? We feel that these issues are the most pressing problems of the largest majority of people in the country and society. What you are studying is only trying to find ways to help a small number of social classes. We feel that it is not worthwhile. Moreover, their deformed phenomenon of sports is not accidental but the inevitable result of the current social system. You finally conclude with [the essence of modern Western civilization], saying that the essence of modern Western civilization lies in: [one is the power of supply, the other is the power of domination]. These words are certainly very interesting, but in today's 20th century, after the European War and the Russian Revolution, when we talk about [the essence of Western civilization], we must further pursue a more precise understanding: that is, there are two kinds of Western civilization today: one is socialist Western civilization, and the other is capitalist Western civilization. They both have [the power of supply] and [the power of domination]. Which is the Western civilization you are talking about - the former or the latter? The difference between them is very serious and cannot be ignored. May I ask!</p>

<h3>The Siamese Government Promulgates New Elementary School Regulations</h3>
<p>Siamese Language Occupies Twenty-Five Hours Per Week</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Request Reduction to Learn Chinese</p>
<p>(Reuters, Singapore, 1st) The Siamese government has recently promulgated new regulations for Siamese elementary schools, stipulating that each elementary school must teach at least twenty-five hours of Siamese language per week. Because overseas Chinese-run elementary schools must spend twenty-five hours per week teaching Siamese, they have no time left to teach Chinese. Moreover, Siamese cannot be used outside of Siam, while Chinese is the common language used by Chinese people in the East for correspondence and accounting. Therefore, they specially convened a meeting and decided to petition the Siamese government to reduce the weekly Siamese teaching time to fifteen hours, so that they would have time to learn Chinese.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Education Continues to Announce Secondary School Curriculum Standards</h3>
<p>Senior and Junior</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 1st) The Ministry of Education has continued to revise the curriculum standards for senior high school military training and nursing (girls are not given military training, so this subject is replaced by physics, logic, and) and junior high school physics, geography, manual arts, agriculture, and home economics. This notice is being sent to the provincial education departments for their information.</p>
<h3>Difficulties in Relocating Beiping Normal University</h3>
<p>Telegram Exchange Between Principal Li and Minister Zhu</p>
<p>(Beiping, 1st) Li Zheng spoke about the relocation of Normal University to Xi'an in a telegram exchange with Minister Zhu yesterday. This proposal arose because Tianjin and Beiping were affected by the Yu War. However, this involves the overall issue of universities in Beiping and Tianjin. The government should have a comprehensive plan. If it is intended to move all universities as per the ministerial order, it can be submitted to the university presidents' conference for discussion. If only Normal University is to be moved separately, there will be many difficulties, and it may not be easy to accomplish.</p>
<h3>Principal's Conference in Jinzhong</h3>
<p>Opening Ceremony Held Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Proposals Reviewed Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>(Taiyuan, 1st) The Shanxi Provincial Secondary School Principals' Conference was held at the Education Department on the 1st. A total of fifty-six schools attended. Director of Education Ji Gongquan presided. Provincial Committee member Li Shangren and others delivered speeches. Over eighty proposals were submitted and reviewed in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Clarifies the Deadline and Procedures for Reorganizing County and District Education Associations</h3>
<p>Previously, the Ministry of Education received a report from the Jiangsu Education Department requesting clarification on the deadline and procedures for reorganizing county and district education associations. The Ministry has now issued instructions to the Jiangsu Education Department stating that, according to Article 2 of the Education Association Law, education associations are legal entities. Unless circumstances under Articles 33 and 34 of the Law exist, there is no need to order the reorganization of established education associations at all levels. As for the term limits of education association officers and directors, this is a separate matter. The expiration of an officer's term should not be regarded as the expiration of the education association itself. The request for clarification is a misunderstanding. Furthermore, if an education association encounters circumstances under Articles 33 and 34 of the Education Association Law and a new association needs to be established, it should be handled in accordance with the relevant articles of Section 3 of the revised regulations on the organization of mass organizations, as well as Articles 11, 12, and 13 of the Education Association Law. You are hereby informed.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Clarifies the Method for University and College Students to Change Their Names</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education, upon receiving a request from Zhang Kuiwen, a student at Soochow University in Shanghai, for clarification of the name change procedure, issued the following instructions: Graduates and current students of colleges and universities who apply for a name change should comply with the revised regulations on the review of name, surname, and parental surname additions by the Ministry of Interior and the regulations stipulated in Bulletin No. 2 issued by the Ministry in the 17th year. You are hereby informed. (Attached are the regulations stipulated by the Ministry of Education) (1) Students at all levels of schools who apply to change their name, surname, or add a parental surname in accordance with Articles 2 and 3 of the regulations promulgated by the Ministry of Interior, students in vocational schools and above should submit their application through the school principal to the Ministry for approval. Students in secondary schools and below should submit their application through the school principal to the local educational administrative authority for approval. In all cases, a certificate from the admission guarantor must be added to the application. (2) Graduates of vocational schools and above who change their name or surname, in addition to complying with the regulations promulgated by the Ministry of Interior, must first submit a certificate from their original school as one of the evidentiary documents to be submitted for review and approval, which should still be directly reported by the original school or forwarded to the Ministry for record.</p>
<p>Local News</p>
<h3>The Municipal Bureau of Education Started Radio Broadcast Classes Last Night</h3>
<p>Divided into Three Subjects: Civics, Chinese Language, and English</p>
<p>Director Pan Speaks on the Significance of Broadcasting</p>
<p>The municipal Bureau of Education began its wireless broadcasting program last night at the Sino-Western Pharmacy broadcasting station. Director Pan himself gave a speech on the significance of the Bureau's broadcasting program. Tonight, Section Chief Chen of the Fourth Section will speak on the "Effort to Eradicate Illiteracy Movement." Thereafter, every Wednesday and Thursday from 7:00 PM to 7:30 PM at the Sino-Western Pharmacy, and on Saturdays at the Great China Electric Company, broadcasts will be aired on time. In addition to Bureau staff, experts will also be invited to speak. The radio broadcast classes organized by the Bureau also began teaching last night. Xie Fusheng is the English instructor. Mr. Xie is very knowledgeable in English language and literature and will greatly benefit the students. Bao Renjie has been hired to teach Civics and Chinese Language. English classes will be held on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. Chinese Language will be held on Mondays and Thursdays, and Civics on Saturdays. Classes will continue to be held alternately, from 9:00 PM to 10:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Speech by Pan Gongzhan</h3>
<p>(1) The nation is now in a state of extreme crisis. If we want to resist foreign insults and protect the lives of our nation and people, we must make all our compatriots understand the dangerous situation we are in, understand their own responsibilities, and resolve to unite and think of ways to save the country. The greatest purpose of education is to [continue the life of the nation]. At this critical moment when the nation's survival is at stake and the life of the nation is under serious threat, we in education cannot ignore the mission we bear. This Bureau is doing its best to promote education in this city, to the best of its ability, and is paying particular attention to national salvation work in education. Therefore, we recently promulgated a "Shame Eradication and National Salvation Plan" to provide national salvation education to students in schools, hoping that each and every one of them can fulfill their civic duties and contribute a part of their strength to the great task of national salvation. However, given the small number of students in schools and the large number of people in society, if we only pay attention to school education, the effectiveness we can hope for will certainly be very limited. For this reason, we are paying twelve times more attention to social education, because the target of social education is very large and the scope of its impact is very broad. In this regard, in addition to establishing mass schools and remedial schools to help elderly illiterate people and ordering affiliated social education institutions to work hard and proceed from all aspects, we also examine social conditions at any time and any place and take the opportunity to promote social education. The Bureau's radio broadcasting program is for this purpose.</p>
<p>(2) Now, radio broadcasting and receiving sets can be said to be very popular in Shanghai. Radio broadcasting stations are everywhere, and middle-class and above families are mostly equipped with radios as a source of entertainment. However, if we just do a little research on what the broadcasting stations usually broadcast and what the listeners like to listen to, we will feel very disappointed. It turns out that, to this day, most of the broadcasting stations are still broadcasting Peking Opera, ballad singing, Suzhou ballads, and other things of this kind, and the listeners also only welcome these programs that are purely for entertainment purposes or contain abnormal ideas. When we are running on the road, the radios in the shops on both sides sometimes send out the sounds of "[Mao] Mao Yu" ["Sister, I Love You"], etc. In short, on the listener's side, most of them have the goal of enjoying low-level entertainment when they buy radios, and on the broadcaster's side, they naturally cater to their preferences and compete to provide everyone with low-level songs. (But the "low-level" mentioned here does not refer to the style of the songs, but to the content of the songs.) Judging from what has been said above, most of the radio broadcasting and receiving parties have not achieved their due purpose, which is what we think is a pity.</p>
<p>Speaking of the function of radio broadcasting and receiving, when a broadcasting station emits a sound, anyone with a radio, no matter how far away they are, only needs to turn on the mechanism and they can clearly hear everything, as if they were face to face. If both the broadcaster and the receiver can use this wonderful tool appropriately, its effectiveness is truly indescribable. Now, we are launching a broadcasting program to make a reform attempt. We want to use the radio as a tool for social education and broadcast educational programs. We want to test whether the listeners have a mood to enjoy noble entertainment. We want to see whether the listeners really have the determination to practice national salvation.</p>
<p>(3) We can summarize the significance of our broadcast in two sentences: to promote social education and to propagate the Three People's Principles.</p>
<p>The Premier said that the Three People's Principles are to teach the public how to save the country. Regarding this point, we have programs such as the Premier's Will, important revolutionary commemorations, national humiliation commemorations, and analyses of important current events. On the one hand, we also want to provide the public with general practical knowledge, so we have also prepared to broadcast hygiene methods, seasonal disease prevention, civics guidance, and various other programs. We also borrow a radio broadcasting class to teach applied subjects. Our lectures strive to be simple and interesting, so that the listeners do not have a sense of boredom. In addition, there are two points worth reporting: First, committee members of the Party Headquarters, the Mayor of this city, and directors of various bureaus, as well as many celebrities in society, will come to serve as broadcasters in the future, giving listeners the opportunity to hear their great opinions. Second, we will also do our best to provide noble entertainment in the future, giving listeners a kind of [pleasantness] that generates new life.</p>
<p>(4) We hope that gentlemen in this city who have radios will support this social education cause, use your radios to receive the necessary sounds, and also invite friends and relatives to listen together, or guide subordinates to report to the broadcast class for enrollment and study. Gentlemen who do not have radios but have the ability to purchase them, quickly buy radios and use them to educate themselves and to educate their children.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Bureau of Education Convened a Meeting of Principals of All Universities and Secondary Schools in the City</h3>

(2) Education Committee member Niu forwarded Wu Jing Elementary School's request to hire an assistant teacher. Resolution: The request to hire an assistant teacher involves the budget and is difficult to approve.

(3) Education Committee member Niu forwarded the report from Daonan Elementary School requesting permission to set up a new grade level and to use the funds saved during the service period to supplement the overflow grade level fee. Resolution: According to the report, the current number of students at the school has not yet reached the standard for two classrooms, and the request is difficult to approve. (4) Education Committee member Niu forwarded Kuoxin Elementary School's request to purchase desks. Resolution: The Bureau will use the school's remaining temporary funds for the year to manufacture household supplies. (5) Education Committee member Niu forwarded the request from the principals of Hua Jing Cangqiao Elementary School to hire assistant teachers. Resolution: To be handled in the same way as item 2.

<h3>Wusong Merchant Marine School Begins Construction</h3>
<p>The Wusong Merchant Marine School, directly under the Ministry of Transportation, is the only place in our country to train senior navigators. Its history is as long as that of Jiaotong University in Shanghai. Since its restoration in the 18th year of the Republic, it has established navigation and engine departments, and its regulations and equipment have always been known to be complete. Since the January 28th Incident, the school buildings and machine factories have been heavily damaged by the bombing of the Japanese invaders. It was forced to rent houses in Shanghai for classes. It also submitted a request for restoration. The Ministry sent special commissioners to survey the school, and after President Xu took office this year, he personally went to Beijing to personally state the necessity of the renovation. He was approved by Minister Zhu to allocate funds for repairs. It is reported that construction has already begun, and it is estimated that it can be completed and moved back to the original school by the end of March.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Issues Reading List for Middle School Students</h3>
<p>In accordance with the spirit of the new curriculum standards, middle school teaching places particular emphasis on extracurricular self-study in addition to classroom lectures. Under the supervision and guidance of teachers, students should develop their ability to read and reference books as much as possible. Therefore, enriching school library facilities is inevitable. In view of this, the Ministry of Education selected essential books suitable for middle school students to read and reference from the well-written and comprehensive Complete Library, compiled a catalog, and issued it to all secondary schools for compliance and purchase. The education departments and bureaus will collect orders and make purchases to save procedures and reduce expenses. All the details are in the Ministry of Education's instruction No. 8028. As for the attached catalog of [Reference Books for Middle School Students], due to the time required for compilation and review, it has only recently been completed and printed into a draft booklet. The catalog lists 56 types of Basic Books of Chinese Classics, 8 types of Chinese translations of World Classics, 36 types of Small Series of Chinese Classics, 15 types of Student Chinese Classics Series, 159 types of Small Encyclopedia Series, 25 types of Normal School Small Series, 19 types of Arithmetic Small Series, 10 types of Medical Small Series, 9 types of Physical Education Small Series, 48 types of New Era History and Geography Series, and the Premier's Will, totaling 406 types. All of them are edited and printed by the Commercial Press as Complete Library editions. The essential reading materials for middle school students in various subjects are basically complete. It is reported that the Commercial Press has prepared the above books in sufficient quantity and is willing to provide its greatest assistance to all schools in enriching their library facilities.</p>
<h3>Patriotic Enthusiasm of Minsheng Elementary School Students</h3>
<p>The Minsheng Elementary School on Beiler Road in the French Concession of this city, starting this semester, has been organized by high school students to form the Minsheng City Aviation National Salvation Savings Association. More than one hundred students in the school donate five copper coins per day, raising one hundred yuan per month. Donations have now begun, and it is reported that more than forty yuan has been accumulated in three weeks, and it is learned that the association will send the funds directly to the Aviation National Salvation Association in the name of the association.</p>
<h3>News from the Vocational Guidance Institute</h3>
<p>1. Initiating Donations to the Righteous Army. The Shanghai Vocational Guidance Institute of the China Vocational Education Society, in view of the tense situation in the Northeast and the long-term resistance of the Righteous Army, whose funds and weapons are sometimes unsustainable, has initiated a campaign to gather a majority of comrades to donate to the Righteous Army as much as possible, to fight for the survival of the country and the personality of the nation. Within a few days of the launch, many parties responded enthusiastically, especially those who were successfully introduced by the Institute. It is reported that Yu Gongpo, Long Chunpo, and Lu Desheng, three gentlemen who were introduced by the Institute to work as low-level staff members at the China Insurance Company, raised 75.8 yuan. Lu Chengliang, who was introduced by the Institute to work as a laborer at the Municipal People's Education Center, and Song Jiaqin, who was introduced to work as a trainee at the Shanghai Bakelite Factory, each donated one yuan. Laborers and trainees are willing to donate so enthusiastically, which is really ashamed for those who have wealth but are stingy. Once a certain amount has been collected, the Society will send it to a reliable fund-receiving organization and disclose the names in the Society's monthly report.</p>
<p>2. Recruiting Draftsmen. The Institute was commissioned yesterday by a cultural institution in this city to hire several draftsmen. Applicants must be male, over 20 years old, and must first send one monochrome drawing of a human figure or animal in steel (5 inches high) and one colored painting (6 inches high, 12 inches wide), as well as a recent 4.5-inch portrait photo and a detailed resume.

The application period is from now until the 8th of this month, and late applications will not be accepted. After being hired, the salary will be from 55 to 100 yuan.</p>

<h3>Chahar Cannot Hold the North China Ball Games</h3>
<p>May be changed to Jinan</p>
<p>Also worried about insufficient preparation</p>
<p>This year's North China ball games were originally scheduled to be held in Chahar. Subsequently, Chahar Province replied to the North China Sports Federation, stating that Chahar Province is preparing to resist Japan due to national crisis and requested that the ball games be moved to another location. The Sports Federation requested all committee members to reply with one of three opinions: (1) Do not hold the games, (2) Hold the games in Chahar Province, (3) Move the games to Jinan. The reporter visited Shang Shumei, director of the Shandong Provincial Sports Field (Shang is a member of the Sports Federation), and asked for his opinion. Shang said, "Regarding the issue of the North China ball games, if they are not held, there is no need to express an opinion. If they are still held in Chahar Province, I am afraid there is no way to deal with the province's excuse of national crisis. Moving them to Jinan, I personally advocate sports and express my support. Whether there is enough time for preparation is a problem. If my simple opinion is enough, I have already replied to the Sports Federation."</p>

<h3>Last Night's Women's Basketball Game: Liangjiang Lost to Western Union</h3>
<p>Score: 26 to 18. Liangjiang Has Lost Four Games in a Row Recently</p>
<p>The Liangjiang women's basketball team lost to the Western Overseas Chinese Women's League team by a score of 18 to 26 last night. They have lost four consecutive games recently, which is a great misfortune for preparing for overseas competition. Observing the players of the team, they are no different from when they won the Xiqing Championship before. Only one additional player has been added, but their skills have greatly regressed. Their shooting has missed the target, their formations appear flustered and disorganized, and their frequent fouls make it difficult for the referee to perform their duties. Given the current situation, if the team wants to compete abroad, they must train harder to avoid giving foreign people a bad impression in the future.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Battle Situation: Last night, the Chinese basketball hall was quite crowded with spectators, but this game lacked excitement. Liangjiang was like a plate of loose sand and had no outstanding performance. Western Union was also mediocre. Because it selected strong players from various Western teams to form, their respective skills were admirable, but they could not communicate with each other, so the situation was ordinary and the interest was weak. Liangjiang was always in a subordinate position and never showed its potential. The closest the score got was four points.</p>
<h3>Match Details</h3>
<p>The match began at 8:15. Referee Zhou Jiaqi. Not long after the start, the Western Union (Xi Lian) team's player "Bo Lin Si" (泼林斯) scored the first goal. Afterwards, the Liangjiang team frequently committed fouls, leading to eight consecutive penalty shots for Western Union, but none were successful. Liangjiang, on the other hand, scored one point through a free throw by Chen Rongming. Western Union's Jie Hansheng (傑漢生) then scored two consecutive goals. The total score for the first quarter was 8-2, with Western Union leading. The second quarter was quite tense. Liangjiang trailed 4-6. The total score for the first half was 14-7. At the start of the second half, Western Union made three substitutions, significantly weakening their strength. Liangjiang seized the opportunity to launch a fierce attack, which proved quite effective. By the end of the third quarter, Liangjiang was ahead by three points, with a total score of 16-20, still four points behind. However, in the fourth quarter, Liangjiang failed to surpass them. In the end, Western Union's brave general, Ms. Bai Nai Te (白乃特), scored two goals, resulting in a final score of 26-18, giving Western Union the victory.</p>

<p>64 to 35</p>
<p>Last night, the Zhongqing Basketball Court hosted a match between the Eagles and the Mailing team. The fitness center, which is usually not very noticeable, was packed with people and extremely lively. At 8:00 PM, the referee blew the whistle, and the competition began. Zheng Zhifang (鄭志芳) of the Eagles scored the first goal. Kong Guangyi (孔廣益) arrived late, and the defense seemed weak. Anderson of Mailing scored four points consecutively. Kong Guangyi was substituted in, and the momentum surged. As a result, the Eagles took the lead in the first half with a score of 30 to 17. After a ten-minute break, the game resumed. Mailing suffered a complete defeat, ultimately losing with a score of 35 to 64. The referee was Chen Fuzhang (陳富章). The lineups are listed below:</p>

<p>National Products Discussion</p>
<h3>What is Expected of the China National Products Company</h3>
<p>— Xue Guangqian</p>
<p>In recent years, the national products movement has surged, but in order to make everyone willing to use national products, it is necessary to first make everyone aware of the advantages of national products and to have convenient access to purchasing and identifying them. Therefore, patriotic individuals in Shanghai who are passionate about national products established the China National Products Company. Since its opening, business has been thriving, which shows that people in Shanghai love using national products, and that national products have their own inherent value that deserves to be loved. It can be asserted that this is not just a temporary impulsive feeling or the result of propaganda. However, for all businesses, at the beginning of their establishment, plans may not be complete, and simplicity is inevitable. The China National Products Company is no exception. Some customers who have been there to purchase goods have returned and told others that while they are deeply pleased to have a purely national products sales organization, they have expressed that various aspects of the facilities are not as satisfactory as they would like. I believe that the public's expectations for the China National Products Company are very high, and any well-intentioned criticisms or suggestions should be used as a warning. Therefore, I am happy to compile the following for reference, hoping that the authorities of the China National Products Company will regard these criticisms as an encouragement. If there are things that need improvement, they should be improved. If not, they should work even harder to make everything perfect, creating a national products company that is ideal for the people.</p>
<p>1. The place is relatively small, and when there are many customers, it becomes extremely crowded. First-time visitors may not mind, but if they are constantly squeezed and unable to purchase goods, they may be discouraged from returning.</p>
<p>2. The variety of goods seems to be too limited. For example, there is only one brand of toothbrushes, toothpaste, and thermos bottles. If someone is used to or prefers another brand, they will not be able to purchase it. Even if they reluctantly purchase the only available brand, they will not be completely satisfied.</p>
<p>3. The colors and patterns of the goods are not complete. For example, silk, wool, and fabrics are not as complete as in ordinary stores, which prevents people from having the satisfaction of choosing freely.</p>
<p>4. Some shop assistants do not pay attention to customers. Even after a customer calls for assistance, the shop assistants push each other and are unwilling to come forward, creating a bad impression for the customer.</p>
<p>5. Most shop assistants seem to be afraid of trouble and are not very attentive to customers. If one or two friendly receptionists could be added to handle various situations, even if they cannot satisfy every customer, they can reduce unintentional slights.</p>
<p>6. More reclining chairs should be placed in the corridors for the elderly, children, and women to rest.</p>
<p>7. The cashier's process is too slow, making customers unwilling to wait for a long time (this may also be a source of increased crowding). Efforts should be made to improve this.</p>
<p>8. Since the company is named "China," it should collect national products from all over the country, not just Shanghai, so that the name matches the reality.</p>
<p>9. Chinese silk should be promoted more, firstly because its texture is strong and durable, which is certainly beyond the reach of imported products, and secondly, in the face of the declining trend of the Chinese silk industry, promoting silk sales is also a way to save it.</p>
<p>10. A section for southern goods should be added, as southern goods are daily necessities for every household, and there are also the most imported goods among them, such as shark fins, dried shrimp (commonly known as Kaiyang), dried scallops, sea cucumbers, jelly (commonly known as agar-agar) ... and white sugar, etc., which are particularly large items. If there is a southern goods section, it will surely make it easier for purchasers to identify them.</p>
<p>11. The painting hanging on the way upstairs seems meaningless. It would be more appropriate to replace it with famous Hunan embroidery or something similar.</p>
<p>12. The storefront downstairs is empty for display and does not do business, which seems uneconomical. If the main businesses such as cosmetics and silks could be moved to the lower floor, it would also make the upper floor less cramped.</p>
<p>13. On the second floor of the China National Products Company, there is a door connecting to the Mainland Department Store, which also has various shops. If this door is not closed, customers will not know which stores belong to the China National Products Company and which do not. If customers later have complaints about these stores, the China National Products Company will inevitably suffer for others. Whether or not this point should be considered is worthy of research.</p>
<p>National Products Forum</p>
<h3>A Pressing Problem Facing National Products Factories</h3>
<p>— Pan Yang'an</p>
<p>Recently, two major unfortunate events occurred in Shanghai's national products factories within a week. One was the boiler explosion at the Zhengtai Rubber Factory, which tragically killed more than eighty male and female workers, creating an unprecedented tragedy. Unexpectedly, less than a week later, a fire broke out at the Yonghe Industrial Manufacturing Factory due to faulty wiring, and a steam cylinder exploded, killing and injuring several male and female workers. These two very tragic events happened to occur during the National Products Year, when efforts are being made to increase production, which is all the more heartbreaking. After this great setback, our national product factory operators should learn from the pain and pay close attention to factory safety equipment in the future.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, there are three elements of production: land, labor, and capital. Land must be developed through the use of labor and capital, and labor and capital should be gradually increased and not be subject to accidental damage. In many factories, machines are running, gears are densely arranged, and chemical raw materials are complex. A moment of carelessness can lead to disaster. Not only are workers' lives seriously injured or killed, but even light injuries can lead to disability, which is extremely tragic. Even the damage to machinery, the suspension of work, the destruction of buildings, and the collapse of industries are regrettable losses of assets. Even in European and American countries, which pay so much attention to safety equipment, dangerous events still occur frequently. The United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, and France all have laws that address emergency events and the handling of chemical substances that are prone to explosion. They are meticulous in ensuring the safety and hygiene of workers. Just take the stairs in safety equipment as an example: The UK's factory regulations in 1901 stipulated that the tread of each step must be at least 10 inches, and the distance between two steps must be at most 7.5 inches. The London Building Act further stipulates that the width of a staircase with 200 people coming and going should be 4 feet 6 inches, and for more than 400 people, 6 inches should be added for every 100 people, up to a width of 9 feet. The New York City Building Act in the United States stipulates that the width of a staircase with 50 people coming and going should be at least 4 feet, and 6 inches should be added for every additional 50 people. The tread of each step must be at least 10.5 inches. The distance between two steps should also not exceed 7.5 inches. Even this seemingly insignificant item of stairs is so strictly regulated for fire safety. Looking back at our country, in recent years, due to the trend of the times, the labor community only knows to demand improved living standards and treatment. However, labor movements have lost proper guidance, and regulations do not have adequate protection. As a result, most of what labor unions fight for is increased wages, while the safety equipment that is directly related to the interests of workers is ignored. Factory leaders are also busy dealing with labor unrest, raising funds, and paying attention to production and sales issues, and they also regard the safety equipment that is directly related to the interests of the factory as something to be tolerated. As a result, two major tragedies occurred in a week, which is truly heartbreaking and regrettable. It is hoped that factory operators will quickly wake up and pay attention to the following points to avoid problems and then try to remedy them.</p>
<p>(1) Each factory should hire experienced safety engineers to plan various safety equipment in order to achieve the goal of preserving machinery and maintaining humanity.</p>
<p>(2) In the future, it is best to use steel-reinforced concrete to build factory buildings in order to avoid fire hazards. Strengthen factory buildings that are not strong enough as soon as possible, and do not be stingy with small expenses.</p>
<p>(3) In dangerous areas, various signs should be placed in the most conspicuous places to warn workers. The signs should be painted red with white letters.</p>
<p>(4) Factory buildings should have multiple emergency exits and emergency ladders, and the emergency exits should not be locked during working hours. (5) Boiler rooms and machine rooms should have at least two entrances and exits.</p>
<p>(6) Factory buildings should have multiple faucets and properly sized and installed belts. (7) Boiler rooms, engine rooms, or places where explosive materials are stored should be isolated from other buildings. (8) If boiler rooms and engine rooms are connected to other factory buildings, they should be isolated from each other, and the partition walls should be made of brick or steel-reinforced concrete and should be at least 12 inches thick.</p>
<p>(9) The storage area for explosives must be well-ventilated, and lead buckets filled with sand should be placed in areas prone to fire due to oil to facilitate rescue.</p>
<p>(10) The safety valves on boilers must be tested frequently to ensure that they can start releasing steam when the steam pressure increases to the predetermined maximum. (11) Factories should have alarms or other warning signals.</p>
<p>(12) Workers and staff in the factory should organize a fire brigade and practice rescue methods frequently. The above are just general situations. For more details, please refer to the "Factory Safety Equipment Guidelines" compiled by the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau (also printed by the Machine Association). All factory operators should have a copy to prepare themselves. In addition, this book contains detailed descriptions of equipment for rescuing workers, elevator equipment, speed and air pressure limits, and protection against electric shock. I hope everyone, no matter how busy they are, will pay attention to it, as it benefits both themselves and others, which is truly a great merit.</p>
<p>Editor's Note</p>
<p>It is easy to risk everything to establish a factory, but it is difficult to manage a factory. Management should be based on scientific methods and, in particular, should have safety equipment. This week, the tragic boiler explosion and the death and injury of workers at the two major factories in Shanghai, in addition to first offering our condolences to the two factories, we also want to advise the authorities of the two factories not to be discouraged. You must know that more setbacks mean more experience, and more disasters mean more caution. In this National Products Year, we can only use the eight words "work hard to produce, fight to the end" to grit our teeth and work hard.</p>
<p>Mobile Exhibition Mr. Wu Pinchan from Songjiang wrote to this publication, saying: "In the current environment of our country," there is no other way out except to work hard to use national products. Therefore, he has decided to launch an association in his hometown this year specifically for using national products, and he wants to prepare a small national products exhibition to make the concept and awareness of national products a part of the minds of ordinary villagers. However, it is very difficult to find national products suitable for rural areas, and he is asking for guidance from this publication. The reporter believes that his proposal is very valuable. I very much hope that the leaders of factories in Shanghai will use the method of mobile exhibitions to hold meetings in various villages, displaying and promoting daily necessities for ordinary people, so that high-quality and inexpensive national products will deeply penetrate the minds of villagers, which will be dozens of times more effective than advertising. Everyone might as well give it a try.</p>
<p>The So-Called Chicago Expo The exhibition of products solicited for China's participation in the Chicago Exposition has opened. After spending half a day going to see it, the reporter felt greatly disappointed and extremely pitiful. The layout of the venue may have been rushed due to time constraints. The only things worthy of praise in the exhibition seem to be porcelain, pottery, and lacquerware, which can be said to have some value in participating. But on closer inspection, these many products have three shortcomings: First, they are too aristocratic, and ordinary people cannot afford them, so how can they represent the general life of the entire population? Second, they lack practicality. They are either for high-ranking scholars to appreciate or to be caressed and played with, or they are only for admiration and worship. How can they represent the industrial spirit of the new China? Third, they lack science. All the products are static, not dynamic. They are all treading the same old path and lack new inventions. The whole room is filled with a stagnant atmosphere, a pile of antiques. How can they represent the national spirit of the new China? They can only be a source of shame, how can they be promoted? But then again, in a nascent industrial country, it is already commendable to have so many national products appear. We can only comfort ourselves with this, and the people in charge can also absolve themselves of responsibility.</p>
<p>The Responsibility of Housewives Ms. Ge Chenghui gave a speech at the Puyi Society on "The Responsibilities of Women in the National Products Year." She started with raising children and spoke very thoroughly. The most admired sentence is: "Women's use of national products is not just empty talk like men's. Women have power, economic power. As long as women have the determination, they are not afraid of anything." Excellent, the women and young ladies must remember these words firmly.</p>

<h3>Eighteen Distorted Reasons, Nineteen Correct Reasons</h3>
<p>— Helu</p>
<p>Unimaginable common sayings and proverbs will naturally become topics of discussion when the time is right. Recently, two sayings have become popular: "Eighteen distorted reasons, only one correct reason."</p>
<p>However, the side that presents the distorted reasons never admits that they are distorted, and always believes that they are just and reasonable principles. This time, the Japanese representative Mr. Matsu at the Geneva conference is truly a representative of the word "Matsu" (松); what does he represent? He represents the meaning of the word "Matsu," which is composed of "eighteen public (十八公)." He has spoken many times at the conference, presenting reasons horizontally and vertically, eighteen distorted reasons, all of which have become principles. How strange and bizarre! The eighteen public of the Matsu representative.</p>
<p>There are a total of nineteen principles in the world. According to the format of "eighteen distorted reasons, only one correct reason," it can be seen that eighteen of them are distorted reasons, and only the nineteenth is the correct reason. Therefore, without the Committee of Nineteen Nations, the eighteen public will be able to speak eloquently, and the eighteen distorted reasons will all become principles. Once there is a fair report from the Committee of Nineteen Nations, then the eighteen principles of the eighteen public will revert to their original state and become eighteen distorted reasons. Ha! Eighteen loses to nineteen, the short should not speak.</p>
<p>Originally, what is contested in playing pai gow is only one point. Nineteen of course beats eighteen, especially when it is a long nineteen and a short eighteen.</p>
<h3>Peace Corps</h3>
<p>— Virtuous Wife</p>
<p>丨Why not remove the firewood from under the cauldron?!</p>
<p>According to a Reuter's dispatch, a British missionary, Miss Roden, who advocated for the Peace Corps plan during the Shanghai War, is now reiterating her proposal. She plans to gather peace-loving men and women, use their bodies as a barrier, and place them between the two armies in Rehe Province to stop the war.</p>
<p>This news sounds sweet and satisfying to us peace-loving Chinese people.</p>
<p>Originally, this kind of self-sacrificing, painful plan is entirely based on a humanitarian standpoint. Two armies confront each other, and the ruthless artillery fire specifically targets human bodies made of flesh and blood – what a cruel thing this is. We, these outdated ordinary people, may find it sweet and satisfying, but the militarist warlords won't even give it a smile. Because in the past few days, newspapers have often carried reports of [Japanese troops massacring refugees], which is enough to prove that the ambition of the militarist warlords is to kill as many people as possible, and they don't care about God or universal love. Under these circumstances, if Miss Roden's proposed Peace Corps becomes a reality, it will only create one more page in the militarists' record of killing. As for what effect it will have on the war, from my nearsighted perspective, frankly, it's zero.</p>
<p>The current wars of the [civilized nations] rely entirely on airplanes dropping bombs indiscriminately, bombing innocent civilians until not a blade of grass is left, to be considered powerful. Therefore, although the Peace Corps praying for peace stands between the lines of the two armies, even if the robbers have a moment of kindness and don't treat them as targets, they will still heartlessly throw bombs behind the Peace Corps. May I ask, does the Peace Corps have any brilliant plan to jump into the air and stop the bombing? In my opinion, it would be better for everyone to hold a stick of incense, kneel down and beg their respective governments to ban the shipment of military supplies to Japan. Perhaps that would be the most reliable and secure method.</p>
<h3>Meat</h3>
<p>— Zhu Fu</p>
<p>丨Never ending, inexhaustible words丨</p>
<p>Mencius said: "[Those in their sixties wear silk and eat meat,]" but that most common modern meat dish has become a delicacy for the special classes of that time. "[Eating meat]" was synonymous with the gentry class. Cao Ju's saying "[Those who eat meat are vulgar,]" and the phrases "brocade clothes and meat dishes" and "the kitchen has fatty meat" all describe the wealth of the wealthy. Duke Huan of Qi had to prostrate himself and accept the sacrificial meat to show his support for the Zhou Dynasty. Mencius' mother bought pork to convince her son of honesty. Chen Ping's distribution of meat was a prototype for ruling the world. And Dongfang Shuo, starving to death, even drew his sword and cut off his own flesh, saying, "Returning it to my wife, what benevolence is that!" Even Confucius praised the joy of listening to Shao music by saying that he did not know the taste of meat for three months. Meat was indeed a special delicacy in ancient times, and a group of meat worshippers were doing their homework on that piece of meat!</p>
<p>Our country's eating habits are very particular; even just meat can be made into different flavors. Famous ones include Zhenjiang's crystal meat, Jinhua's preserved meat, Guangdong's roast pork, as well as braised pork, four-joy meatballs, Dongpo pork... all cooked until they are fatty, rich, and delicious, making diners lick their lips and smack their tongues, and recorded in classics and historical records. My fellow Suzhou people also have to cure bacon and pickle it with soy sauce at the end of the year, and then air-dry it, waiting for the spring bamboo shoots to come on the market, then taking it down to cook with the bamboo shoots. The aroma of that bacon really stretches the nose of a glutton by three feet.</p>
<p>I don't know who created the "[meat screen,]" so the scope of meat has been extended to women. Those women who sell their flesh are called salted meat, and even the prices for meat were set, such as three yuan for a cut and five yuan for a slice. That white fleshy arm, when waved, that greasy fleshy leg, when crossed, that fat fleshy arm, when twisted, and those high fleshy breasts, when they trembled, it is said that this waving, crossing, twisting, and trembling are called "[sensuality]." So, relying on the highest peak of the art of waving, crossing, twisting, and trembling – the sensual dance – newspaper advertisements actually published the fragrance of meat! Ah! What a fragrant and seductive meat article: "The Carnal Prayer Mat"!!</p>
<p>After the three northeastern provinces were annexed by the enemy, the compatriots of the three northeastern provinces became meat on the chopping block, at the mercy of others, living the lives of doomed slaves in a puppet state. A group of resisting heroes are fighting with their flesh and blood against the enemy's planes, heavy artillery, and tanks. In the northeast corner, every day is spent amidst the continuous artillery fire and flying flesh and blood. Now that Beipiao has fallen and Rehe is in danger, all of the country's compatriots are about to become meat in the mouths of the strong! Can the meat eaters in the interior save the money they spend on meat to buy anti-Japanese planes and change the flesh-to-flesh combat on the front lines, and join the anti-Japanese flesh-to-flesh front line?</p>
<h3>Aviation Patriotic Movement Song</h3>
<p>— Qian Xiaoshan</p>
<p>Sages use soldiers as a last resort. Today's wars rely on advanced weapons. Alas, the September 18th and January 28th Incidents. How can the people avenge the national humiliation? Current strategy emphasizes national defense. First, aviation must be organized. Let us not stand by and watch. The Chaoyang Kailu battle begins. Four hundred million Chinese compatriots. Quickly empty your pockets without hesitation. Know that when the country is lost, the home no longer exists. Saving the country and saving the home are originally the same. Donate to build a thousand airplanes. Organize an air force to raise the Han banner. Ride the wind and waves out of the customs. If the Eastern barbarians are not defeated, what are we waiting for? I think of all the organizations and students. Who will be left behind in this passionate cause? If we do not save the country at this opportunity. To whom will we express our later suffering? I, as a humble person, dare not abandon myself. I wish to be like the social poet Bai Juyi. Thinking of using popular seven-character songs. To tell my countrymen to rise up together. But those who only want flowers, wine, and meat. Put down your cups and chopsticks and first redeem this.</p>
<h3>The Beauty of Male Over Female</h3>
<p>— Bo Guang</p>
<p>丨Are Women More Beautiful Than Men?丨</p>
<p>The rooster that crows at dawn, the black dog that guards at night, and even the pheasant in the mountains… all of them are more beautiful in the male than the female.</p>
<p>Bright red crest, golden feathers, majestic call, its beauty is to attract the female to follow, avoiding its own elimination. The dog, the male's fur is shinier than the female's, and it is stronger. The mountain pheasant goes without saying, the male is certainly much more beautiful. All creatures in the world cannot escape the natural beauty of the male!</p>
<p>Are women more beautiful than men? This is difficult to determine. In ancient times, there were four great beauties: Xi Shi, Diao Chan, Consort Yang, and Zhaojun. Old novels still say that they had "[a countenance that could sink fish and bring down geese]" and "[a face that could hide the moon and shame flowers]." But men, since ancient times, have also had Pan An, Song Yu, and Xu Gong of the north of the city. So, are women more beautiful than men?</p>
<p>Modern times talk about beautification, artisticization, nude beauty, and the beauty of curves. This has made some modern women dizzy, perming their hair, putting on lipstick, drawing their eyebrows… studying their intentions, it's nothing more than wanting people to call them beautiful.</p>
<p>What about men? They are also learning to put effort into decoration! In fact, without decoration, there is a natural beauty.</p>
<p>Now various schools are promoting healthy beauty, leading young men and women to the path of simplicity, so as not to develop extravagant habits. This is a good phenomenon for society! But men are always more handsome than women, and this is after both men and women have removed their decorations.</p>
<p>Novel</p>
<h3>The Landlord</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Woof... Woof... Woof... Suddenly, there was another commotion in the dwarf's team. In the fierce battle at the entrance of the village just now, six dog heroes, born and raised in Chongming, half of them had died heroically for Chongming. The three who had not died, after dyeing their yellow fur with fresh red, had once retreated into the forest with their old master, the landlord! However, when the Fifth Elder's request was rejected by the landlord, they took their injuries, swam across the river for the second time, determined to do their meager best to give the little bells a considerable chance to break through.</p>
<p>Woof... Woof... Woof! Grab! Bite! Pounce! At this time, they had the might of fierce tigers; no matter how sharp his dwarf sword was, it was simply ineffective before it completely cut off their bodies. One dog could almost fight ten dwarves, and the battle lasted for thirty or forty minutes.</p>
<p>Woo... Woo The triumphant horn was blowing across the river, and the dwarves began to sit down to rest; two little martyrs and three dog heroes had completed their great wish to sacrifice themselves for righteousness at almost the same time.</p>
<p>The forest was silent, and a humorous funeral was held under the faint starlight. The forty-year-old widowed aunt excitedly led the wives of the eldest and second sons, bringing out many ointments and cloths to wrap up the wounded warriors one by one; the landlord glanced at them sideways, and a triumphant smile appeared on his determined face.</p>
<p>Prepare things for the night! The aunt went to handle the rear affairs again. How many people do we have left? The landlord was convinced that the dwarves' temporary cessation of the offensive was definitely not out of fear, nor was it obstructed by the small river less than two feet wide, but was a rest for a large-scale attack; therefore, before dinner, the old man was busy actively deploying defenses in the forest surrounding the village.</p>
<p>Including those who had been seriously and lightly wounded, the total number of soldiers in the Tian family village was exactly fifty people! Two cooks who were replaced by Brother Zhao were also included in the team! The weakness of the defense line was an undeniable fact. It immediately made the battle-experienced landlord feel an indescribable desolation and grief, but he remained extremely calm, and encouraged every warrior with the most optimistic attitude.

<p>World Rare News</p>
<h3>Korean Prostitutes</h3>
<p>— Ruo Mu</p>
<p>[There are three times more prostitutes in Jinju than there are locusts.] This is a Korean proverb. From the meaning of this sentence, we can know how many prostitutes there are in Korea. Historically, the places that produce prostitutes in Korea are mostly the capital, Pyongyang, Jinju, Jeonju, and Haeju. However, the most beautiful and intelligent prostitutes are undoubtedly those of Pyongyang. And Pyongyang's prostitutes seem to be superior in all aspects.</p>
<p>Speaking of Pyongyang's prostitutes, it's really interesting! There is even a so-called prostitute school there. Naturally, this school is a training ground for excellent prostitutes. It accommodates girls between the ages of ten and fifteen, and the daily class hours are set from 10:00 am to 5:00 pm. The subjects include singing and dancing, music, calligraphy, poetry, painting, self-cultivation, national language, and Chinese, etc. It may be a unique and novel thing to have a subject like self-cultivation in such a school.</p>
<p>Therefore, there were many Korean prostitutes in the past who were quite talented. Even among the prostitutes of recent times, there are still many who can write poetry and paint. The most interesting thing is that when they draw, they always cannot escape the so-called "[Four Gentlemen]" – plum blossoms, orchids, bamboo, and chrysanthemums. Those prostitutes who are less elegant naturally like [spring ardor] the most, perhaps because these prostitutes have not thoroughly studied self-cultivation. Furthermore, there are also prostitutes who can write Chinese poems, which seems even more rare! Among the poems written by prostitutes that remain today, there are many lingering and poignant works. For example, the poem by Yeonju, a prostitute from Seongcheon: [You value sending me off with tears, and I also contain tears] returning; I wish to become the rain of Yangtai, and further sprinkle your clothes. Also, Qin Ge's poem: [First parting in Changxing Cave, secretly breaking the soul by Chengma Bridge! Fragrant] grass and setting sun after parting, where does the fallen flower not miss you? For poems like these, we cannot help but say that they have a unique charm. In addition, there are more who can write poems in Japanese, and it is indeed impossible to list them all, such as Ryu Jishin, Kim Kwangwook, Gye Lang, Lee Jiik, etc., who have all made many good poems. Such elegant and talented prostitutes are probably rare in China. No, to say boldly, it is impossible to find one or two in modern Chinese prostitutes.</p>
<p>At the same time, Korean prostitutes, like Chinese prostitutes, have a very long history. Since the Goryeo Dynasty allowed prostitutes to enter and leave the five palaces, they have gradually become prosperous, especially in the Joseon Dynasty, when the power of prostitutes was even greater. The Joseon Dynasty had four types of official prostitutes, namely (1) pharmacy prostitutes, (2) Shangyi Yuan prostitutes, (3) Hye Minseo prostitutes, (4) Hwalinseo prostitutes, etc. King Sejong once issued an order to select a certain number of prostitutes from each county and have them learn poetry, Fisherman's Lyrics, Spring Sleep Song, Yearning Song, Wine Encouragement Song, male dance, monk dance, sword dance, drums, etc. These learning official prostitutes had to go to the office to which they belonged on the 1st and 15th of each month, especially the prostitutes under the jurisdiction of the pharmacy, who had to attend court once a month.</p>
<p>Many prostitutes are hereditary, but there are also many women from good families who are dazzled by the empty vanity of entering and leaving the noble and powerful, and become prostitutes, and of course, there are even more who have no choice but to become prostitutes for economic reasons.</p>
<p>It can be seen that the reason why there are so many Korean prostitutes, and the reason why prostitutes have literary talent, is by no means accidental. Needless to say, there is a historical basis for it.</p>

<h3>The Gold Market is Financially Sound</h3>
<p>A Smooth Journey Back to Seven Hundred Seventy-One Taels and One Dime</p>
<p>According to foreign telegrams yesterday, the London gold market showed an increase of .0625 for both near and distant terms, exchange rates remained steady with minor fluctuations, New York silver prices remained unchanged, but forward silver prices rose by more than .03, roughly .028. Private bank telegrams consequently rose to 1.875, maintaining confidence in the market, leading to an opening price of 768 taels and 9 dimes. The exchange market opened with slightly stronger sterling and steady U.S. dollars. Prices initially fell to 8 taels, but then rose to over 70 taels due to purchase orders for both sterling at 1.875 and U.S. dollars at .875 for the current month. Major holders repeatedly sold off, struggling around the 70 tael mark but ultimately maintaining an upward trend. Mitsui sold June U.S. dollars at 29.4375, raising them by about 1 tael. Zhejiang tended to sell, at the same price and month, but retreated to 9 taels and 4 dimes. HSBC's official rates were also released at this time, showing no change in either sterling or U.S. exchange rates. Soon after, the exchange market gradually tightened, and the gold market also spiraled upwards. Finally, Datong sharply raised June U.S. dollars to 29.3125, rising by 2 taels and 7 dimes. As the closing time approached, many sellers emerged, resulting in a pullback. The final closing price was 771 taels and 1 dime. The afternoon session was closed for Wednesday. A review of the half-day market reveals it was generally uneventful, fluctuating by over 4 taels, ultimately closing higher than the previous day due to stable market sentiment. Spot-forward spreads saw very little activity, with the spot price increasing by 12 taels, slightly higher than the previous day. While the March-April forward spread was quoted at 3 taels, this price was difficult to achieve. The trend appeared bullish due to the lack of spot deliveries, seemingly pushing prices higher. The Central Bank continued to offer spot gold, but in limited quantities, and had no noticeable impact on the market due to its inherent strength. The half-day market conditions are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>The morning opened at 768 taels and 9 dimes, a rise of 1 tael and 9 dimes from the previous close. The opening price for silver dollars was 9 taels, and the exchange market also opened flat. Recent offerings were 1 shilling 8 pence 25 for sterling and 28.875 for U.S. dollars, with only sterling appearing slightly stronger at .0625 compared to the previous close, initially reaching 9 taels and 2 dimes, then falling to 8 taels. Hengxing repeatedly sold in the aftermath, but market sentiment was strong, and prices instead trended higher. Silver dollars were continuously bought, and the psychological state of small investors was positive, causing market prices to soar. Major holders such as Fuchang, Zhifeng, Yongfu, and Yu all sold, but only struggled for a few dimes. The exchange market also tightened, rising to over 70 taels. Purchase orders were placed for both sterling at 1.875 and U.S. dollars at .875 for the current month, with Qingfa, Yongda, Xingyong, and Lai buying, rising to .05. Zhifengyong also entered, reaching 1 tael. Zhejiang sold May U.S. dollars at .25, and Yongfeng then sold, gradually falling to within 70 taels, at 9 taels. However, Fuyu was limited in its ability to purchase, which helped to hold the price. Mitsui raised the price of June U.S. dollars to .4375, and Yuancheng, Yongri, and Chang all took advantage of the low price to enter the market, again breaking through 70 taels, at .06. But due to the fact that Zhejiang was willing to sell June U.S. dollars at .4375, Fuchang sold, breaking to 9 taels and 4 dimes, and the market situation remained stable. HSBC's official rates did not distinguish between different grades, and Dadecheng, Yifengyong bought in. The exchange market also changed frequently, with June U.S. dollars suddenly becoming difficult to settle at .4375. In addition, Hongli also entered the market, rising to 1 tael and 3 dimes. Zhifengyong sold within its limited trading range, and the price then pulled back. Fuchang and Fuyu continued to sell, falling to 9 taels and 8 dimes. There was a great deal of hovering at this time, but the trend was extremely stable. Someone sought to settle June U.S. dollars at .375, and Hongli entered again, with retail investors also raising prices, rising to over 2 taels, at 2 taels and 1 dime. Huabi sold June .375, exiting both positions, spiraling down to 70 taels and 3 dimes. After this, there was a long period of calm, hovering around 1 tael. Once Yuanmao, Yongda, Xingyong, etc. entered slightly, the state of calm was broken, rising to 1 tael and 7 dimes. Holan sold June U.S. dollars at .375, and Yifengyong sold at a high price, again falling to .04, but buyers continued to surge in, once again rising by 2 taels. When Datong continued to accept June U.S. dollars at .3125, Fuyu entered, resulting in a sharp rise, reaching 1 tael and 7 dimes. At this point, Hengxing once opened spot gold on behalf of the Central Bank, but because there were suddenly many sellers, it was not clear what effect this had. At this time, trading was easy at 2 taels, and in a short period of time, Xiexingyong and Yifengyong successively sold off. The noon closing time was approaching, so buyers showed a slight wait-and-see attitude, and prices could not be sustained, again falling to within 1 tael, at .07. Before long, the noon closing price was 771 taels and 1 dime. Silver dollars were auctioned at 1 tael. A review of the half-day shows the highest price was 772 taels and 7 dimes, the lowest price was 768 taels, a difference of 4 taels and 7 dimes, and a rise of 4 taels and 1 dime compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>Because HSBC's posted rates remained unchanged, the U.S. exchange rate was still calculated at 28.375, with the alloy price at 845 taels 8 dimes and 1 fen. Based on the closing price, the premium was approximately 74 taels, slightly lower than the previous closing premium of 4 taels. The current month's registered price was 774 taels, April was 771 taels, and the morning compensation was 773 taels.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was still active. Overall, Fuchang, Futaiheng, Yuanxing, Chengyong, Fengwanxing, Hengxing, Xiexingyong, Yifengyong, etc., were the sellers, and Bingxing, Yuanmao, Yongfu, Xingyong, Zhaofeng, Changchunyuan, Yongda, Decheng, Daxingyong, Hongli, Qingfayong, Yuanshengyong, Richang, etc., were all buying. The Dalian and Guangdong gangs did not engage in large-scale buying and selling. Up to the 28th, the April contract volume totaled over 26,800 contracts.</p>
<p>Spot-forward spreads were slightly higher, market conditions were stable, and there was little trading. The price was estimated to be 12 taels above spot. Only Tongfeng Heng entered the market, and the silver shops exited, with a volume of over 100 taels. Other than that, it was quiet, and the trend seemed stable. Although the March-April forward spread was traded at par, there was a lot of silence afterwards, so initially, Dachencheng, a short seller, posted 70 contracts to Qianchangxiang, with a price of 3 taels, which became an unattainable premium. The spot market was lacking sources yesterday and today. The spot traders had already issued future bids for the previous shipments, so that today's forward positions were lacking. Short sellers Ruixing and Qingfayong sought counterparties, but it was extremely difficult to obtain them, so formal transactions could not be seen again in the market, and the trend looked good. As of the 28th, 2,345 March contracts remained. Of the deliveries yesterday, short sellers Qianchangxiang, Yingfeng, and Heng collectively settled 450.5 contracts, and long holders Hengyu, Runchangyong, and Hengxing accepted them.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Shows Slight Changes</h3>
<p>Morning Opening...Tightening Sharply After the Announcement</p>
<p>More Delivery...Various Banks Both Delivered and Accepted</p>
<p>The exchange market initially opened steadily because London gold prices had risen slightly by .0625 for both near and distant terms, the pound rose by .25 against the dollar, and the dollar fell by .3125 against the pound, so the recent sterling rate in the local market opened at 1 shilling 8 pence .25, slightly firmer by .0625 than the previous closing. The New York gold rate showed no movement, the forward silver price on the Gold Exchange rose by .03, and private bank telegrams only increased by .1875. U.S. cotton showed a slight decline. Market sentiment was initially stable because of yesterday's drop. The recent offering price for the U.S. dollar was $28.875, which was very calm. After opening, the gold market rose, so this price was difficult to settle. The HSBC official rates for sterling and U.S. dollars both remained unchanged, which was still normal at the time. After that, it tightened sharply once, with June U.S. dollars reaching $29.325, which was better by .125 than the initial opening. However, because there were not many transactions, and the afternoon closing time was approaching, it could not be better. Banks such as Mitsui, Datong, and Zhongfu all made deliveries, with gold traders delivering more than accepting. The transaction was originally small. There were no formal transactions for sterling, and it was very quiet. Extending to the afternoon closing, the offered price for the recent term was 1 shilling 8 pence .1875 (or .125) for sterling, .25 for April and May, and .3125 for June and July. The bidding price ranged from 1 shilling 8 pence .25 to .375.</p>
<p>The morning opening for the U.S. dollar was $28.875, the same as the previous closing price. Zhejiang offered Zhongfu May at .25. Mitsui and Zhongfu both accepted June at .4375. HSBC took May at .25. Pan Gen accepted June at .4375. Huabi sold June at .375 to Mitsui. Huayi accepted May at .25. HSBC sold March at .8125 to gold traders. Holan sold June at .375 to Datong Jinzhi. Datong continued to buy the same month at .3125. Datong did a swap in May at .1875. Huabi and Mitsui did a swap in June at .3125. The closing price offered was $28.8125 for March, $29.00 for April, $.125 for May, $.1325 for June, and $.4375 for July. The bidding price ranged from $18.9375 to $29.5625, a difference of .625 between March and July. The spread between swaps was already large. One U.S. dollar was equivalent to 3 taels 5 dimes 2 fen 4 li 2 hao of silver.</p>
<h3>Big Cable Retracted .0625</h3>
<p>National Press, London, 1st. The big cable was slightly higher. At closing, the near-term was 17 pence .0625, the far-term was 17 pence .125, each up .0625 from the previous day. Also, the exchange rate between the British and American currencies opened at 3 yuan 4 jiao 1 fen .125.</p>
<h3>Lingering 洋釐 (Foreign Customs Surtax)</h3>
<p>丨Departmental Order Unarrived... Ten Days Postponement丨</p>
<p>Yesterday was originally intended as the day to abolish the market price of the foreign customs surtax. However, due to the lack of a formal explicit document from the Ministry of Finance, the Currency Dealers' Committee decided to temporarily postpone it for ten days. If the departmental order still does not arrive within these ten days, or if it needs to be extended again, it is still uncertain. Therefore, yesterday, the surtax price was still handled as usual, with market quotations opening as usual.</p>
<p>Surtax Conversion Prices [Foreign Customs Surtax]: The morning market was at 7 yuan, 1 fen, 4 li, 8 hao, and 7 hu and a half. The afternoon market was at 7.1 yuan, 4 li, and 7 hao and a half. The result was a slight decrease of 1 hao and 2 hu and a half. However, there were few transactions and the situation was sluggish. [Silver Conversion]: Both the morning and afternoon markets were at 2 fen, with a surcharge of 3 or 4 fen. The silver market situation was very weak.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Coin Market: Jiangnan small coins were at 6 yuan, 1 fen, and 5 li in the morning market, and 6 yuan, 1 fen, and 3 li in the afternoon market. Transaction volume was 8,500 jiao in the morning market and 6,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Guangdong small coins were at 5 yuan, 8 fen, 4 li, 2 hao, and a half in the morning market, and 5 yuan, 8 fen, and 4 li in the afternoon market.

<h3>Security and Public Bond Market Gloomy and Lifeless</h3>
<p>Each Transaction Session is Quiet</p>
<p>No Inflow or Outflow from Large Investors</p>
<p>Yesterday, the public bond market of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was unprecedentedly sluggish. Considering the war situation and the urgency in Tianjin, there was hope for improvement in the bond market. However, the bullish side did not take action, so the weakness was limited. It was reported that the Japanese were rumored to attack Tianjin, which led to weakness from morning to evening, but the volume was extremely limited. Due to the quiet transactions in each pricing session, the market price remained unchanged at 5 fen, resulting in a rare state of gloom and lifelessness. Until the afternoon closing, when the Ministry of Finance Salt Tax bonds were being auctioned, a sudden demand of tens of thousands from the Northern faction abruptly raised the price by 2 jiao to half a yuan, which reveals the inactivity of the German-denominated chips. At this time, the market price fluctuated because both sides were watching to see if the war would expand to North China or remain only in the Northeast. However, in this precarious situation, such dullness cannot last long. The full-day market price results showed that, except for a slight increase of 2 jiao in Salt Tax bonds, all others fell by 1 jiao to 9 jiao uniformly. Due to the absence of large investors' buying and selling, the total transaction volume for the two months of March and April was only 2,411,000 yuan, of which spot trading was only 1,000 yuan for Disbandment bonds. Futures trading in Salt Tax bonds accounted for the largest amount, only 535,000 yuan. Disbandment and Unified Tax bonds accounted for over 400,000 yuan, and the remainder only ranged from tens of thousands to 200,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>New York Stock Market Slightly Improved</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported that on Tuesday (the 28th), the New York stock market showed improvement. The reason was due to the entry of short sellers, a good railway report for January, and strong government bonds and wheat. However, speculators mostly watched, so the market was particularly deserted. The position of national banks is gradually becoming more stable. Fox West Coast Corporation in Los Angeles has filed for bankruptcy due to inability to repay debts. A total of 910,000 shares were traded today. The closing prices of several stocks are recorded below: (unit: gold dollar) Allied Chemical 6, American Foreign Power Preferred 9, American Water Works and Electric 12.75, Auburn Automobile 32, Canadian Pacific Railway 8.5, Chase National Bank 22.25, Columbia Gas &amp; Electric 11.5, Continental Can 34, General Electric 12, General Motors 10, Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber 10, International Telephone and Telegraph 5.375, Liggett &amp; Myers Tobacco 51.5, National City Bank 28, Radio Corporation of America 3, Standard Oil of New Jersey 6.375, United States Steel 24.25, Woolworth's 27.

<h3>Rumor of Passage of the US Cotton Acreage Reduction Plan</h3>
<p>The Post-Market for Marked Yarn and Cotton Turns from Weak to Firm</p>
<p>The yarn market was weak in the morning and rose in the afternoon, but the trend remained weak and sluggish. Due to sluggish actual sales, the acceptance of various groups was very slow, and the situation became more serious, making silver tight. It's becoming difficult for commerce to develop, and Tianjin cotton yarn is constantly being shipped to Shanghai. However, some, due to their underlying positions, tend to go long, but the overall trend is bad, the inventory is too thick, and the pressure is still heavy.</p>
<p>The bidding on yarn was soft in the morning and steady in the afternoon. At the opening of the pre-market, the market atmosphere was mediocre. In the first three rounds, short positions were covered, causing a slight increase, but then it fell again at the close, with each month falling by 1, 2, and 3 yuan. The afternoon opening was mediocre. In the second and third rounds, following the rise of raw cotton, each month rose by 4 and 6 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was 24,700 bales. Rongxing sold 1,150 bales, Mingde 1,200 bales, Renfeng 700 bales, Dafeng 650 bales, and Hengde 450 bales. Gengfeng bought 1,350 bales, Yuanda 1,250 bales, Yongchang 1,300 bales, Chunji 600 bales, and Dafeng 650 bales. The closing prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Closing Prices for Bidding, Increase or Decrease Inventory Amount</p>
<p>June 1429 Up 60 30,800</p>
<p>March 1391 Up 30 37,300 July 1435 40 24,850</p>
<p>April 1404 10 49,100 August 1444 70</p>
<p>May 1419 40 42,800 Total 14,850</p>
<p>Yarn Sales Not Significant: Actual yarn sales remained flat. It was found that the total purchase by various groups for the day was 724 bales, with a price increase of 2 jiao and a half. The purchase amounts for each group are as follows:</p>
<p>Sichuan 20 Anqing 44 Fujian 10</p>
<p>Inland 100 Shantou 155 Ningbo 25</p>
<p>Counterparts 40 Wuhu 50</p>
<p>Guangdong 275 Xiamen 5</p>
<p>The cotton market fell in the morning and rose in the afternoon, but the trend remained weak. Due to sluggish yarn sales, the demand for raw cotton was quite stagnant. However, the overall bullish force was still strong. In the afternoon, the market also widely spread the rumor that the House of Representatives had passed the Smith-Tiesse bill to reduce cotton acreage. As a result, market sentiment suddenly tightened and buying surged. However, judging from the overall situation, the upward trend is more lacking, and Indian cotton is continuously reaching new lows.</p>
<p>Zheng Bidding Slightly Up: At the opening of the Zheng Bidding pre-market, due to the sharp drop in Indian cotton, market sentiment was not good, and each price fell by 5 fen to 2 jiao. In the afternoon, due to the maintenance theory for US cotton, market sentiment rebounded, and each month rose by 3 jiao and 5 fen. The total transaction volume for the day was 54,700 dan. Yuanda sold 2,900 dan, Tongfu 1,000 dan, Hengyi 1,800 dan, Daji 1,300 dan, Rongxing 2,400 dan, Yongda 1,000 dan, and Xincheng 1,700 dan. Gengfeng bought 6,800 dan, Yongchang 2,400 dan, Taixing 1,400 dan, Xinheng 1,300 dan, and Yuanxingchang 1,300 dan. The closing prices are as follows:</p>

<p>Factory Isolate No spot cotton transactions Quite quiet, no trading has opened.</p>
<h3>Foreign Cotton Unanimously Declines</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market was mixed. It was strong at first due to the strength of Wall Street, but then weakened due to reactionary selling. Futures fell by 1 to 2 points per pound, and spot prices remained unchanged. British cotton futures fell by 4 to 7 points, and spot prices fell by 5 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 12 points. Indian cotton weakened due to sales by Japanese merchants and European exporters. Flat good fell by 5 rupees, and Omra and White Raw fell by 5.25 rupees. The original telegram records are as follows: (Telegram on the 28th) US Cotton Compared to Previous Day Equivalent to Shanghai Rules British Cotton Compared to Previous Day Equivalent to Shanghai Rules</p>

<h3>Grain and Flour Prices Unanimously Ease</h3>
<p>丨Supply Exceeds Demand: Difficult to Revive丨</p>
<p>After the opening of the flour market yesterday morning, prices showed an initial flat trend followed by a decline in each month. Although the quoted price for foreign wheat was slightly better by 1 or 2 jiao, the market sentiment was extremely depressed. Currently, the turnover of chips at each factory is smooth, such as military ships, old cars, etc., can all be directly sampled according to standards without restrictions. It can be known that the abundance of flour supply is no longer doubtful. In addition, the situation in the north is becoming more serious, and sales may be temporarily affected. The market sentiment became weaker and lacked the momentum to recover. Until the afternoon opening, the market price for the current month was still unstable. Due to the withdrawal of non-industry bulls, Tianjin dealers were slightly active in the morning but watched in the afternoon, making the situation even gloomier. Distant months also eased unanimously due to falling buyer interest. In the future, if supply continues to exceed demand, the prospects are still difficult to be optimistic. As a result, the current month fell by 1 fen and 7 li and a half compared to the previous month's closing, April fell by 2 fen and a half, May and June fell by 1 fen and 2 li and a half, and July fell by 1 fen. August was opened for auction as usual, with an opening price of 1 tael, 7 qian, and 5 fen and a half, but there were no subsequent fluctuations.</p>
<h3>Near-Term Wheat Falls by Four to Five Fen</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the futures wheat market generally showed signs of decline. Although the quoted price of foreign wheat had improved by 1 or 2 jiao, the current difficulty lies in the influx of foreign wheat. The goods ordered by various Qing companies are naturally included, and those ordered by professionals are also arriving one after another. However, the actual sales are suffering from the lack of activity from factories and the lack of purchasing power from non-industry buyers. Therefore, near-term months are forced to be lowered. Distant months are also losing market confidence due to the availability of foreign wheat for ordering. Even trading is becoming less lively. The closing results showed that the current month fell by 4 fen compared to the end of the previous month, April fell by 5 fen, June opened at 3 taels and 2 qian without a price comparison, July fell by 2 fen, and August initially opened at 3 taels, 2 qian, and 2 fen, and then fell by 2 fen.</p>
<h3>客秈 (Ke Xian) Rice Sales Turn Weak</h3>
<p>The 閩 (Min) Dealers’ Appetite Turns Strong Foreign Rice Sold Open at 500 Bags</p>
<p>Yesterday, the arrival of 客秈 (Ke Xian) rice was not prosperous. However, the appetite in this street suddenly weakened, with only about 600 bags being traded in the general market. However, since the sales of the intermediate dealers were light, the market turned flat. They took the opportunity to buy more than 2,000 bags of Jiangxi Machine Late Rice in the market in the morning. The market suddenly became active. Due to incompatible cargo samples, more than 1,000 bags were returned that day, with only 1,000 bags of Zhongguan Machine Late Rice being traded, priced at 8 yuan, 4 jiao and 2 jiao. The cloth and the previous day had no major changes. This street paused slightly after continuous active trading in recent days, with a total of 150 bags of Hunan Machine Red Rice being sold, priced at 8 yuan, 3 jiao and a half, and another 280 bags of Machine Jing, priced at 7 yuan, 8 jiao to 6 jiao. 160 bags of Nanjing Che Machine Xian were priced at 7 yuan, 3 jiao. The market was also similar to the previous market, but the situation was slightly weaker. Although overseas telegrams were reported for foreign rice, the firms did not dare to get involved due to last year's losses. A telegram arrived yesterday stating that Saigon No. 1 was priced at 4 taels and 5 fen per 100 jin, which was similar to the price in Shanghai, but no agreement was reached. For spot goods, a foreign firm sold 500 bags of Saigon No. 1 in the rice market, priced at 8 yuan and a half, which was taken over by this street. The price was 2 jiao and 7 fen lower than the end of last month.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Peanut Oil Marked Down by 8 Qian</h3>
<p>Since the oil market changed to using the new scale, market evaluations have inevitably become divergent from time to time. Buyers and sellers often accuse each other, and over time, the goods accumulate, forcing the cargo households to reduce prices for sales. Therefore, yesterday, 1,200 pieces of Light-Skin Raw Oil, 800 pieces of Inter-Warehouse Raw Oil, and 200 pieces of Boer Raw Oil were sold open, and the prices were all 7 to 8 qian lower than the previous market. Although soybean oil was not opened yesterday, the subsequent situation may also be subject to a price-cutting situation.</p>
<h3>閘北 (Zhabei) Sundry Goods: 雜路 (Zalu) Longan Circle Number Plate Suddenly Rises</h3>
<p>The arrival of 雜路 (Zalu) longan has been scarce recently. In addition, local prices in various places have been reported to be rising, and the trend has suddenly become tight. Yesterday, the number plate was opened at over 200 pieces, with prices rising by 1 to 2 taels to several qian compared to the previous plate. If there are no unexpected obstacles in the future, the post-market is expected to be firm. Judging from the letters from various producing areas, the new round of harvests in the future are expected to be poor, so market sentiment is rising.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea Foreign Bank Silk Increasingly Lifeless</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the local foreign bank silk market was increasingly lifeless. European and American firms, considering that the overseas silk market was deteriorating, and Japanese silk was competing relentlessly and prices were becoming increasingly weak, were all watching without moving forward. Chinese silk merchants also had a very negative attitude. Yesterday afternoon, there were no transactions in either spot or futures silk. The future of the silk market is becoming increasingly bleak. European and American silk sales are stagnant, with little to report on the market situation.</p>
<p>Rayon Sales Dull</p>
<p>The February rayon futures were only settled and resolved the day before yesterday. As out-of-town dealers are busy shipping spot goods, it is reasonable to expect the market to be light. In addition, foreign exchange has returned to volatility, and the market is dull. Yesterday, only the spot market in this street had some transactions. The stocking group purchased more than a dozen boxes of Italian German rayon spot goods, which were sold by the number plate group, without special distinction in price.</p>
<h3>Business Sutra (15)</h3>
<p>The Indispensable Copper</p>
<p>The steel plates we use, the bullets for cannons, and the copperware for industrial and domestic use are all made of [copper]. Copper is divided into copper and brass.</p>
<p>Copper comes from the United States, and there are many brands. The T brand and FG brand are the two brands sold on the market. Among them, the T brand is the best, with 999 parts per thousand being pure copper, and 1 part being other substances. The second is the TG brand, with a purity of 997.5. The third is the FC brand, with a purity of only 995. There is also the Three Star brand, and the purity of these two brands is about the same as the FC brand. However, the T brand and TG brand are mostly sold on the market now. The other three brands have very little sales due to purity, and there are often shortages. The shape of Copper is 1 foot 2-3 inches long, 3-4 inches wide, the surface is wavy and bumpy, and the bottom has two shallow concave shapes. The color is dark red, and each piece weighs 33-34 catties. Its application is most extensive in mints, arsenals, sand casting factories, and industrial factories.</p>
<p>Brass is divided into raw and cooked. Its shape is 1 foot 2-3 inches long, 5-6 inches wide, and slightly more than 1 inch thick. The surface is wavy and bumpy, and the bottom is rough. If it is combined with zinc, the color will be very bright. 1The copperware for household use in steelware stores is this kind of composite steel. White copper, also called cloud white copper, is made of copper and nickel. It is white like silver, and bright white copperware is made of white copper. However, white copper is very expensive. General copperware stores take advantage of the situation and use zincware stores to plate copper with zinc-nickel. Like white steel, it is naturally considered white copper when sold.</p>
<p>Copper wire is available in red and yellow. The numbers represent the thickness. Number 1 is the thickest, and so on down to number 36, which is the thinnest. There are American and Japanese goods. Foreign goods are rolled into circular rolls, wrapped in hemp cloth, and weigh 100 catties and 84 catties respectively. When buying, wages must be added, depending on the thickness.</p>
<p>Copper sheets are also divided into red and yellow. There are different thicknesses, also in the order of numbers. The thickest is 5 fen. Each sheet is 4 feet long and about 1 foot 2 inches wide. The German goods have a natural color, the Japanese goods have an unusually bright color, and the texture is slightly softer. Each box weighs 2.5 tons. Copper sheets, Copper wires and red and yellow copper sheets, red and yellow copper wires are the same, but the color is purple. Electricity companies use the most.</p>
<h3>The Astonishing Dispute Arising from Sea Measures and Market Measures</h3>
<p>The Remote and Recent Causes of Rice Measure Troubles: In recent years, the situation has been unstable and the nation burdened with calamities, resulting in financial stagnation, halted grain sales, plummeting grain prices, and unsecured accounts. The remote cause of rice measure disputes lies precisely here. Following the poisonous drug smuggling incident aboard the rice-carrying boats of fellow villagers last year, the rice shops' measure operators used heavy measures, leading to a temporary strike and the blocking of other rice boats from coming to Shanghai. The measure operators also staged a strike. The matter was eventually resolved through official mediation, but this only deepened resentment and intensified internal brewing conflicts. Rice shops and measure operators organized trade unions, while rice-carrying boat merchants also formed associations to resist. On February 1st of this year, bean and rice merchants, in compliance with regulations, began using new measuring instruments, which were smaller than the old ones, conflicting with the habits of the trade. Consumers were also confused. At this time, Jiangsu rice could freely circulate throughout the northern and southern provinces, and rice from the lower reaches of the Yangtze River was being packed in large quantities for transportation. Changing the measure size effectively increased transportation costs and tariffs for merchants (as they were still calculated using the old measures). Therefore, they demanded the use of a six-dou market measure and an increase in the number of sheng and dou. Rice shops in the street requested a re-calibration of the measures. Recalibration would inevitably lead to losses due to air drying and leakage. To avoid personal losses, the measure operators proposed restoring the customary retention (heavy) measure, which was opposed by merchants and boatmen, who demanded the use of a funnel to level the measure (light measure). This negotiation over heavy and light measures again led to a strike by some merchants, and rice boats were once again blocked by these striking merchants. This is the recent cause and effect of rice transportation to Shanghai being obstructed.</p>
<p>The Differences in the Use of Market Measures, Sea Measures, and Temple Measures: There are three types of measures used by grain merchants in Shanghai: one is the sea measure, the second is the canal measure (used for the official transport of grain during the Qing Dynasty), and the third is the temple measure. The volume is equal to the canal measure and is used by bean traders specializing in beans from outside the Great Wall and along the coast of Shandong (referred to as "Guanhang Goods"). Therefore, it is also known as the bean measure, to distinguish it from the sea measure used for rice. It is called the temple measure because the public office of the bean industry, the Cuixiu Hall, is located within the city temple. The merchant guild organized by sand boat merchants, the Merchant Boat Guild Hall, also uses this type of measure, hence the name Guild Hall measure. The sea measure is used for all grains other than Guanhang beans, such as wheat, soybeans, broad beans, and other miscellaneous grains. The notices issued by the rice shops also stated that cereals, millet, and other morning produce all fall under this category. Therefore, wholesale transactions of peanuts, peanut kernels, and other goods in the northern goods trade also fall under the rice industry. Since the prevalence of weighing scales, businesses and customers have sought to reduce procedures and save costs. Goods are now packaged and measured by dan (a unit of weight) instead of shi (a unit of volume). The scope of use for measures has gradually shrunk. In recent years, new crops of broad beans and wheat arriving in Shanghai are also often measured by weight.</p>
<p>Comparison of Sea Measures with Local Measures: The division of jin (a unit of weight) per shi (a unit of volume) of sea measure varies due to the skill of the operator, the weight used, and the quality of the goods. However, the industry has a fixed standard weight, which is equivalent to 200 pounds on a scale and 150 jin on a Sima scale. This refers to the weight of white rice from the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. The weight of wheat, soybeans, and broad beans is less than this, as wheat weighs less than rice. One shi of wheat is only slightly over 140 jin, with lower and lighter ones being just over 130 jin. Soybeans and broad beans also vary. For rice, except for khách hương rice and foreign rice, measures have been used for thousands of years. The volume of local measures differs from that of the Shanghai sea measure. The "95," "97," and "98" mentioned in the market are actually calculated after deducting the total amount after unloading, and do not mean that one shi from the producing area only yields 9.5, 9.7, or 9.8 dou in Shanghai. A survey shows that very few measures in various producing areas are larger than or equal to the Shanghai sea measure, accounting for less than one-tenth of the total. Most are smaller than the sea measure, and some are modeled after the size of the canal measure, being about one dou less than the sea measure. A shortage of one dou per shi is equivalent to a shortage of five sheng per hu (as one hu is five dou), or a shortage of three, four, or even seven or eight sheng. The amount exceeds the sea measure only in Songjiang and a few nearby places. The number of dou per shi of rice from various producing areas compared to the Shanghai sea measure is attached below (numbers below sheng are rounded using the rounding method):</p>
<p>Sijing: 1 shi 0.04 sheng Qipu: 9 dou 8 sheng</p>

<p>The Issuance of Official Measures and Mother-Son Measures: The history of the Shanghai sea measure and temple measure is quite long. The sea measure was used before the temple measure. However, initially, it was only a custom used by merchants in a single county. Due to differences in interests, there were many cases of privately altering the size of the measures. Later, when brokerage firms were established, they paid taxes and received permits from the government, and also requested the issuance of official measures to ensure uniformity. The government, in order to alleviate the suffering of the people and regulate measurement, issued official measures to the bean and rice industries during the Jiaqing reign of the Qing Dynasty. The rice industry received the Shanghai County Measure, which was the measure customarily used by all merchants in Shanghai County, and was referred to as the sea measure for short. The bean industry received the canal measure used for paying grain tribute, which was exactly the same size (this measure was wrapped with iron skin and was called the "iron-skin official measure" in the industry). It was placed in the public office of the industry and used as the mother measure. Each brokerage firm prepared funds to have the public office produce copies for distribution. These copied measures were called son measures. Due to use, the son measures were subject to wear and tear, damage, bulging, and shrinking over time. The public office decided to convene regular inspections to prevent deviations and intentional fraud. Initially, the inspection was scheduled for the second day of each month, but this was found to be too frequent and burdensome. The schedule was changed to quarterly inspections, held in the upper ten days of February, May, July, and November each year. The bean industry adhered to this schedule for a long time. The rice sea measure was changed to twice a year, once in the first ten days of March and once in the first ten days of August. The measure inspection was conducted by the industry's monthly directors (who were selected from reputable experts in the industry to serve in rotation) and overseen by the industry's directors (currently known as chairmen) and committee members, with invitations to fair and respected elders and dignitaries in the industry to supervise the process. Because of the conflicting interests with merchants, rice customers, and rice shops, representatives from the South Guild Hall and the Chang Guild Hall were also invited to participate in the inspection. The measure inspection process was quite solemn, as it was of great importance to the people's food supply and the livelihoods of both merchants and rice shops. Therefore, the procedures were numerous and complex.</p>
<p>Measure Inspection Methods: First, the mother measure (i.e., the iron-skin official measure) was used for calibration. Previously, rapeseed and other materials were used for calibration, but later peppercorns were used. The peppercorns were poured into the mother measure using a funnel. After leveling, the peppercorns were poured into the son measure using a funnel. If the son measure was too wide, a wooden "Ding Sheng" (industry term for a wooden wedge with the image of Yuanbao, ancient Chinese money) was placed inside. The wooden Ding Sheng was branded with the date of the inspection. There were five sizes of wooden Ding Sheng: Rifu, Rilu, Rishou, Rishou, and Riqing, with Rifu being the largest and decreasing in size accordingly. If the measure was found to be too large, too small, damaged, shrunk, or inconsistent with the standards during the inspection, or if the Yuanbao was missing without explanation, it was considered fraudulent. After discussion and deliberation by all parties, if fraud was confirmed, a penalty was imposed according to regulations. After inspection by all parties, the industry's public office and the merchants' public office would issue a small ticket to be affixed to the outside of the measure, stating the date of the inspection and the number and type of Yuanbao that should be present, in order to ensure fairness and provide a reference for the next inspection. If the measure had not been inspected for a long time or had obvious signs of fraud, rice shops and boatmen could report it.</p>
<p>Techniques and Jargon for Light Measures and Heavy Measures: Using measures to measure rice was originally intended to achieve fairness and transparency. Therefore, the industry's principle for using measures was to level the measure or scrape off the excess. Too light would benefit the rice customers and harm the rice shops that purchased the rice, and vice versa. However, skilled measure operators could please both parties, ensuring that one party received the full weight and the other appeared to have less on the surface, but the true weight was not lacking due to hidden techniques. However, most of the current measure operators are young and inexperienced. Their skills are not perfect and their movements are clumsy. Therefore, the rice shops demand recalibration and the merchants demand the use of a funnel to create a light measure, putting them in a difficult position. The method for creating a heavy measure is to forcefully pour rice into the measure, leaving the rim overflowing without leveling. The industry jargon also includes "Phoenix Three Points," which refers to the technique of forcefully filling the measure in three quick motions after lifting the basket, pouring the rice straight down (a type of measure filling in the countryside, taking the measure from above). Using this method, each dan of rice would have at least five or six sheng more. A light measure involves gently pouring the rice in and using the douyuan (a tool for leveling) to spin it twice at the end. The rim is incomplete and the middle is low. The jargon for this is "Missing Basin and Digging Corners" or "Adjusting Missing Corners and Feeding Chicken Coops," which describes the insufficient quantity. However, experienced operators can make it appear this way on the surface, while the true weight of the rice is not lacking. Some operators may appear to forcefully fill the measure, but the quantity is actually insufficient. According to industry custom, rice sent out for forwarding (i.e., the rice forwarding business) must not be shortchanged. Orders from baozi customers are treated more casually. Geographically speaking, heavy measures are mostly used in Zhabei, while level measures are mostly used in Nanshi. The fact that the prices in Zhabei are several jiao (a unit of currency) higher than those in Nanshi on the price lists is due to the difference in the size of the measure. The common misconception that the rice quality in Zhabei is higher and the rice quality in Nanshi is medium and low is not entirely true.</p>
<p>Comparison of Market Measures and Sea Measures: One shi of market measure is equal to 156 jin of market weight. One shi of market measure is equal to 8 dou 5 sheng 4.5 he (a unit of volume) of sea measure. One shi of canal measure (equal to the temple measure) is equal to 9 dou of sea measure. One shi of sea measure is equal to 200 pounds, which is equal to 250 jin on a Sima scale. One shi of market measure is equal to 170.9 pounds, which is equal to 128.175 jin on a Sima scale. One shi of market measure is 1 dou 4 sheng 5.5 he less than one shi of sea measure, and also 4 sheng 5.5 he less than one shi of canal measure. The price of one shi of market measure, according to the industry standard, is discounted by 18.5%, but the retail price in the market is actually higher. As a result, the consumers suffer. Therefore, the general public does not support the government's use of new measures. Even those in the industry find the new system inconvenient due to numerous exceptions and additional costs, and also find the procedures unfamiliar. Merchants and shopkeepers alike deeply resent the government's new policy. Furthermore, people in the rice shops said that the dou and sheng issued by the government are not calibrated properly. One dou is actually 1 dou 0.04 he, and five sheng is actually 5 sheng 2 he. This may be cheaper for poor people buying in small quantities, but the industry has applied to the trade association to request that the government take back the inaccurate measures.</p>

<h3>The Birth of Rumors and Prophecies</h3>
<p>— Yu Dafu</p>
<p>The breeding ground for rumors and prophecies is primarily where people are lazy and don't do proper work. The reason why there are so many rumors and prophecies in China is because the entire Chinese population is idle and does not engage in legitimate work. From those in high positions to the vagrants and beggars in cities and villages, is there anyone in China who is diligently working hard? Rumors and prophecies tend to emerge after a major upheaval has been quelled or during the continuation of chaos. The major catalyst for these rumors and prophecies is, of course, the despotic oppression of those in authority and the ignorance of the general populace, who have been tamed by policies designed to keep them uninformed.</p>
<p>After every war or natural disaster in China, there are always many bizarre and unbelievable rumors and printed prophecies like "Tui Bei Tu" and "Shaobing Song." In times of crisis and hardship, the emergence of rumors is inevitable. One person tells two, and two tell three. Initially, it's said that there's a rebellion in Xijing, but later it turns into a mundane matter of "cold rice and leftover vegetables." A single word can turn into ten words or even a complete story with a beginning and an end. Gogol's "The Inspector General" and Sheridan's "The School for Scandal" vividly depict the spread of rumors. This is inevitable, but in countries where the public is educated, the social foundation is solid, and the rulers do not randomly kill or oppress people, this phenomenon is less common. As for prophecies, they further demonstrate the negative impact of rulers suppressing freedom of speech. People with insight have long seen the flaws in society but dare not speak plainly, so they resort to divine will and revelation, creating fantastical prophecies to spread widely. Whether it's a stele unearthed somewhere or a strange occurrence in a village, prophecy makers are mostly those who can exploit the weaknesses of the people and understand how to stimulate their psychology. Therefore, the content of prophecies tends to focus on dynastic changes and mass deaths. From a historical, social, and ethnic perspective, this tendency could form a great work like "The Golden Bough." Here, I can only briefly say that the origin of Chinese prophecies is influenced by Taoism, stemming from the "Hetu Luoshu." In modern times, the oppression of rulers and the laziness and ignorance of the people are the furnaces that create these absurd tales.</p>
<p>In the recent two weeks, I've been reminded of two things: first, the explosion at the rubber factory in Yangshupu and Zhabei, supposedly because the iron pot was a Japanese product. But I wonder if anyone saw Japanese people going in to plant explosives before the explosion. Second, with the fall of the Great Wall and the collapse of Rehe, I wonder if a stele by Liu Bowen will emerge.</p>
<h3>Rationalization</h3>
<p>— Tuturan</p>
<p>The Masai, a nomadic people of East Africa, are the absolute rulers over the Bantu, an agricultural people. They plunder and slaughter the Bantu at will and claim this is "rationalized." They say: "God bestowed all livestock upon the Masai, so the Bantu, who raise livestock, should obediently offer all their livestock to us Masai, and then the world will be at peace. But because of their rudeness, disobedience to God's will, and refusal to offer livestock to us, we are forced to kill their people and seize their livestock," and so on.</p>
<p>Within the Masai region also live the Wandorobo, a hunting people. Although the Masai regard them as lowly, they pity them and do not plunder and slaughter them as they do the Bantu. However, examining the reason for this kindness, it is because the Masai, who live a nomadic life, do not eat what is obtained from hunting, so they have no need to oppress the Wandorobo. They only use them as spies.</p>
<p>Among the Wandorobo, the blacksmiths are considered the lowest. These blacksmiths, like blacksmiths in civilized countries, are employed in making weapons for conquering other tribes. The Masai do not intermarry with these blacksmiths and never enter their homes. Before using anything made by a blacksmith, they must apply oil to cleanse it of impurity. Legend has it that speaking the word "blacksmith" at night will attract lions. Masai who kill blacksmiths are not guilty, and if a slave kills a Masai, they can kill several blacksmiths to make amends.</p>
<p>The Masai, who, like the Taiwanese aborigines, consider killing a mark of honor, say that killing blacksmiths is rationalized. They say: "God forbids the shedding of human blood, but blacksmiths do not fear offending God and manufacture weapons that cause bloodshed. Killing these irreverent blacksmiths appeases God."</p>
<p>At a "rationalization" conference called the Pacific Conference, held in Kyoto, thousands of kilometers from Africa, the Chinese representative said: "Japan is pursuing its political and territorial ambitions in Manchuria, excluding Chinese sovereignty from Chinese territory. Everything is handled arbitrarily by Japanese officials. Chinese people are managed by Japanese police. The gates of Manchuria are closed to China and other countries. Under the pretext of preventing communist infiltration, a large army is stationed in Manchuria. The Manchurian Railway is monopolized, hindering transportation within Chinese territory. The Twenty-One Demands are forcing China to become a colony, etc., etc."</p>
<p>The Japanese representative said that this is all rationalized. They said: "Peace in Manchuria is maintained by Japan's power. The economic development of Manchuria is entirely Japan's gift. Japan has no political or territorial ambitions in Manchuria and does not desire to implement such a policy. The railway monopoly is a result of the post-Russo-Japanese War agreements. However, China disregarded good faith and secretly built competing lines in violation of the agreements. The Japanese garrison in Manchuria consists of only seven thousand men, but its prestige can maintain peace in Manchuria because it is backed by a powerful army and navy. Japan has sacrificed ten thousand lives and two billion yuan to build Manchuria today. It is ridiculous and unbearable to hear that China cannot maintain its own territory and wants to detach Manchuria from Japan's hands. Etc., etc."</p>
<p>"Rationalization" is not only used in the West, but also in Africa and the East. "Science transcends national borders" is what this means!</p>

<h3>Sunday Miscellany</h3>
<p>— Zhang Kebiao</p>
<p>Logically, Sunday should be a day of rest, doing nothing. Sleeping in a few extra minutes in the morning, going to bed early at night, sitting quietly in a chair during the day, preferably without even reading the newspaper. Taking a walk on the street in the afternoon to invigorate the blood, then leisurely returning home. This day should be spent refusing guests and not visiting others. The less talking, the better. Physical labor should be avoided, and no diary entries or letters need to be answered. It should be a full day of genuine rest. Only this day is my own time, only this day can I indulge in laziness. I want to be as lazy as possible. If I could lie in bed and not get up, that would be ideal. Sometimes I even wish I had a minor illness for a day.</p>
<p>Today, I changed my mind. I picked up my pen to write. I want to do a little work, and it would be even better if I could do more with enthusiasm. This isn't for any particular reason. This morning, I was awakened from my sleep by firecrackers. I suspected it was gunfire. After realizing it was firecrackers, the roaring of the explosions made me even more uneasy. I saw in the newspaper yesterday that the great battle in the North had already begun. Now is a time of crisis for our nation's survival. The cry that national disaster is upon us has spread throughout the streets. How can I remain unmoved?</p>
<p>During times of national crisis, everyone should work harder. I believe in this statement, and I am determined to follow it starting today. Let me begin by writing a Sunday miscellany. Because I only have time to write on Sundays, it's called "Sunday Difficulty to Remember." And with the words "Difficulty to Remember," I can write in a disorganized and fragmented manner, without having to put on the airs of a literati or pretend to be a scholar. For me, it's easier to write without affectation.</p>
<p>The reason why literati are literati is that some of them indeed rely on affectation. I also sometimes affect, but I'm becoming less and less accustomed to it lately. You can tell by how little writing I do. Now I want to try to create a type of miscellaneous writing that doesn't require this affectation. Perhaps there's another way. Moreover, this is work that is increased because of the national crisis, so I should encourage myself and not be glib, which is more in line with righteousness.</p>
<p>This morning, I said that I heard the sound of firecrackers in my sleep and mistook them for gunfire, and after realizing they were firecrackers, the war in the North stimulated my brain. I seemed to hear the roaring of gunfire. So I realized that a national crisis was at hand and resolved to write a Sunday miscellany. This happened in the morning, so the first thing I want to talk about is the morning.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "The plan for the year lies in spring, and the plan for the day lies in morning." Presumably, the air is fresh in the morning, and the mind is also sharp, so it's more thorough to make plans. It's very right to estimate and budget the day's events in the morning. Please forgive me for interpreting the word "plan" as "to intend," perhaps there is another, more profound meaning, but I feel that the word "to intend" is sufficient, and it's not entirely bad. Everything in the world must be intended, and no one doesn't intend, only the pseudo-moralists reject intention, but in fact, they are still faithful believers in intention. However, one cannot intend in sleep, so one must get up in the morning. What I want to say is just this: people who don't get up in the morning have no morning in their lives, and city dwellers mostly lack morning. Their lives are a bit abnormal. Ordinary people work during the day, but they work at night. For example, in Shanghai, there are quite a few official Shanghainese who don't get out of bed until the afternoon, but midnight is their most active time, as if they are afraid of sunlight.</p>
<p>But they can't be blamed. All city dwellers are the same. Dance halls, cafes, and bars are bustling and full of genuine flavor at that time, and the essence of the city is also in these places. Having become city dwellers, they can't help but treat night as day, and the lights, the shadows, all the artificial paradises, do indeed have something to make people linger. It is the extreme expression of humanity's victory over nature. Night is the time for rest, and the sky doesn't give light, but artificial lights are more tempting than sunlight. Just in terms of the lights, the night is already worth praising, and there are also various artificial realms of joy. From this point of view, city dwellers tend to rebel against nature and indulge in their own power, intoxicated by their own greatness. They only worship artificial greatness and forget about nature.

<h3>Black Woman's Quest for God (15)</h3>
<p>— By Seabury, Translated by Yi Xian</p>
<p>[Among the gods I have encountered or heard about in this search, there are now six; but none of them is the God I am seeking.] said the black girl.</p>
<p>[Are you seeking God?] said the first gentleman. [Wouldn't it be better for you to be satisfied with] [Mumbo Jumbo] (Note) or whatever you call the god of your tribe? You won't find that any of our gods are more advanced than him.]</p>
<p>(Note) An idol worshiped by natives of West Africa.</p>
<p>[We have collected quite a few miscellaneous] [Mumbo Jumbos], said the third gentleman. [We can't, in good conscience, recommend any] to you.]</p>
<p>[That's hard to say,] said the black girl. [But you should still be careful. The missionaries teach us to believe in your gods. The]</p>
<p>lesson we have learned is just this. If we understand that you don't believe in those gods and are actually their enemies, then we might kill you. We have millions of people; we can shoot as well as you. [There's some truth to that,] said the second gentleman. [How can we teach these people things we don't believe in?]</p>
<p>They might listen very carefully. Why not tell them the simple truth: that the universe goes through natural selection and God is a fable?]</p>
<p>[That would make them believe in the doctrine of the survival of the fittest,] said the first gentleman doubtfully; [and if we compete with them], are we the fittest to survive? That's hard to say. That girl is a very good specimen. When it comes to doing the work of this tour group, we'll have to not hire distressed white people; these natives are stronger, cleaner, and smarter than them.]</p>
<p>[And much better behaved,] said one of the ladies.</p>
<p>[Absolutely,] said the first gentleman. [So, I really think it's better to teach them to believe in God. If they start a movement against] European atheism, then God will give us a chance to oppose them.]</p>
<p>[You can't teach these people the truth about the universe,] said a lady wearing glasses. [We now know that this universe is a]</p>
<p>mathematical universe. Just teach that girl to divide a number by the square root of minus X (i.e., negative! Translator's note), she definitely won't understand you at all, but dividing by minus X is the key to the universe.]</p>
<p>[A key that can be used everywhere?] said the second gentleman. [In my opinion, the square root of minus X is meaningless.] Natural selection, that's it! !]</p>
<p>[What's the use of all this?] groaned a weary gentleman. [The one thing we know for sure is that the sun is]</p>
<p>losing its heat, and we're going to freeze to death soon. What else matters in the face of this fact?]</p>
<p>[Cheer up, Mr. Croaker,] said a lively young gentleman. [I, as the director of physics for this tour group (note)],</p>
<p>am able to tell you a principle that will make you believe that unless you reject the undeniable fact of the universe's heat death, you have just as much reason to believe that the sun is gradually heating up and will eventually burn us all alive.]</p>
<p>(Note) In the original text, this title differs from [Chief Physician] by only two letters.</p>

<p>(Beiping) Yesterday, troops attacked Lingyuan from Hetao Gully, with Tang Yulin personally commanding the route (2nd Special Dispatch). (Beiping) A telegram from Chengde stated that more than 10,000 Japanese rebel troops in the Chaoyang area launched a fierce attack on Taipingfang this morning. At around 3 PM, the artillery fire intensified, and the Japanese rebel troops broke through our Dong Brigade's front line, advancing along the Daling River through Xipingfang Mutouchengzi, pressing towards our Yebaishou defense line. Our Dong Brigade and the Kawamura Cavalry Brigade engaged in fierce battles in the Laohushan area until nightfall, with the artillery fire not ceasing. A major battle is expected in the Yebaishou area tomorrow, as the Japanese army clearly intends to occupy the area as a base for attacking Lingyuan. (2nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Chengde telegraphed at 9 PM on the 1st, stating that the Japanese army was focusing all its efforts on attacking Shamao Mountain for four days and nights. The enemy failed to gain an inch. This morning at 3 AM, they dispatched 5,000 to 6,000 troops from Qiantunwei, led by Japanese chieftain Tani Yoshikazu, to sneak across the Mingshuitang Bianmen, disturbing our Lingnan right flank and supporting the enemy on Shamao Mountain. The Cheng Ding Brigade, which originally had defenses in the area, engaged in fierce resistance with the enemy from Laoyemiao in the east to Huagou in the west. At the time of the telegram, the artillery fire from both sides was still dense. The telegram also stated that the Japanese rebel army, with the Kawaguchi unit and Shao Benliang's rebel army as the main force, had fled into the Hetao Gully area. The area is very close to Lingyuan. After a fierce bombardment by the artillery of our 16th Division, the Japanese rebel army collapsed and fled in disarray towards the Doubaodian area. Our side captured two small armored vehicles and five machine guns. (2nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Chengde telegraphed at 9 PM on the 1st, stating that the Japanese army launched a general offensive on the front line this morning. On the Shamao Mountain front, the Hattori Brigade and Suzuki Brigade, numbering about 20,000, began shelling our mountain positions at 8 AM, with the artillery fire continuing throughout the day. The cavalry charged five or six times, but our Sun Brigade and Ding Brigade joined forces in hand-to-hand combat, preventing the enemy from succeeding. On the Japanese side, Cui Yaowu and Wen Zochen, two rebel recruits with 500 to 600 bandits each, joined the battle, acting as accomplices. Our cavalry launched a head-on attack, and corpses were scattered everywhere. The Japanese army suffered many casualties, making it one of the most intense scenes since the start of the war. (2nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The official Chifeng telegram stated that Sun Dianying personally inspected the front line positions, greatly boosting morale. However, due to the free movement of a certain righteous army unit recently, our original defense plan was changed. Sun is personally supervising the construction of new positions. The Japanese army, with the Mogi unit, Kurotani unit, and Matsuda Brigade as the main force, is rushing to build positions twenty miles north of Chifeng and began a fierce attack on us last night at 8 PM. (2nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Starting at 10 AM yesterday morning, Japanese planes, in formations of eight, bombed Yebaishou in shifts, dropping many bombs. 70-80% of civilian houses were destroyed. (2nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese propaganda that there has been a change in our Chifeng positions is completely inaccurate. Because our Chifeng defense army still reported by telegram last night, that our army positions are extremely solid. (2nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Foreign news reports that the enemy Matsuda unit entered Jianping on the 1st, then advanced north again, approaching Paoshouyingzi, and approaching Chifeng, but the official has not yet received a telegram. (2nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Chengde telegraphed that the enemy Hattori and Suzuki Brigades, numbering about 20,000, launched five or six cavalry charges on our Shamao Mountain positions yesterday, but all failed. Then, the enemy sent Cui Yaowu and Wen Zochen, two rebels, to join the battle, and they all suffered heavy losses. (2nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese rebel army, with the Kawahara unit and Shao Benliang's rebel army as the main force, fled into the Hetao Gully area. After a fierce bombardment by the artillery of our 16th Division, the enemy collapsed towards the Doubaodian area. We captured two small armored vehicles and machine guns. (2nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Frontline telegrams stated that traitor Zhang Jinghui, as the general commander of the attack on Jehol, arrived in Kailu from Tongliao on the 1st. An enemy plane scouted Chifeng for an hour at 10 AM on the 1st, then dropped two bombs on Xinglongzhuang, north of Chifeng, injuring two people and two cows. It was learned that the enemy had decided to attack Chifeng with 40 planes and 100 tanks. The situation there is tense. Lingnan is still in our army's hands. There is no news from Jianping. (2nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting in the Baitaizi Area</h3>

<h3>Japanese Army Bombards Yebaishou Fiercely</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The Chinese authorities deny the Japanese report of the fall of Chifeng. This morning, they received an official report from the front line stating that Lingyuan has also not been captured by the Japanese army. The official report mentioned the fierce bombardment of Yebaishou by the Japanese army yesterday. The Japanese army must either break through the White Stone Mouth Chinese army defense line to spy on Lingyuan, or pass through the Yebaishou mountain pass to reach Lingyuan. It is heard that Yebaishou Town has been completely destroyed after continuous bombing. The Japanese army is now destroying the trees that conceal the Chinese army's rear defense line. Yesterday afternoon, eight Japanese planes appeared over Yebaishou eight times, dropping all their bombs before returning. The forests on the mountainside caught fire from the bombs, so it has now become a barren mountain. (2nd Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Sun Dianying's Army Holds Chifeng Firmly</h3>
<p>(Beiping) News came from the front line last night that Japanese planes and light artillery units began a fierce bombardment of the Chinese army's foremost positions in Chifeng last night.

Our side defended Gaoligou, Xiaoyangshuwan, the east and west banks of Zizigou, Wangtaizi, Tutoushan, and other places. From the 23rd to the 25th of last month, the fighting was extremely fierce.

<h3>League of Nations Administrative Council Discusses South American Colombia-Peru Dispute</h3>
<p>The Three-Person Committee Recommends:</p>
<p>Peruvian Troops Should Withdraw from the Disputed Area, to be Guarded by International Troops</p>
<p>The Peruvian Representative Actually Imitates the Japanese and Quibbles</p>
<p>Gu Weijun Strongly Urges Both Parties to Accept</p>
<p>Planting a Precedent for World Peace</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Administrative Council met tonight for two and a half hours to consider the report of the three-person committee on the dispute between Peru and Colombia over the town of Leticia. The three-person committee recommended that Peruvian troops withdraw from the territory and that the League of Nations organize a commission to take over the territory, with Colombian troops maintaining order in the territory, but that the troops must be international in nature. The three-person committee considers this a prerequisite for resolving the dispute between the two sides. The Colombian representative immediately stated that he accepted the report and asked Peru to also accept the mediation procedure, otherwise Peru would be subject to adverse effects under Article 15 of the Covenant. The Administrative Council has now authorized the three-person committee to begin drafting the report. Chinese representative Dr. Gu Weijun endorsed the committee's report and urged both parties to accept the report, so as to establish a precedent in this troubled world to maintain peace. The Peruvian representative gave a long speech, comparing Peruvians to Japanese, saying that Peruvians are also moved by the spirit of patriotism and willingness to sacrifice, and that Peru upholds the dignity of international obligations and respects treaties, but that there is a distinction between honorable and dishonorable treaties, and that all dishonorable treaties should be destroyed. The Peruvian representative then requested a few days of hesitation time so that the Peruvian government could consider the reply. Representatives from thirteen countries attended the administrative meeting today, with the Japanese representative absent. The chairman made no criticism of the matter. (1st Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>Reuters Washington Telegram on the 1st: The new president's inauguration is only three days away. Washington D.C. is decorated with colorful flags and is celebrating. The climate in March is clear and bright, and the streets are full of tourists, making the celebration joyful. However, beneath this surface of encouragement and joy, the new cabinet members are deeply contemplating. Although they have not yet taken office, they are already considering solutions to various problems. The recent bank turmoil has suddenly arisen, and the country's finances are unstable. How will it be stabilized? How will international economic disputes, such as war debts and tariffs, be resolved? How will the central government, which is running at a deficit, be balanced? These few problems alone are enough to cause the new government great hesitation after it is established on March 4. After selecting his cabinet members, the new president, Roosevelt, traveled to New York by car today. Tomorrow, he will lead his entire family to Washington D.C.</p>

<p>Havas Paris Telegram on the 1st: The Radical Party held its plenary congress. The party leader, former Prime Minister Herriot, declared: [In recent weeks, the international situation has become increasingly serious, that is, the rupture between Japan and the League of Nations. No one feels more anxious about this matter than France. During the European War, Japan provided assistance to the Allied countries. Its organizational ability and its efforts towards civilization are something that we cannot forget. But we French people, as followers of republicanism, ultimately believe that the principle of [respecting international treaties and the League of Nations Covenant] must be maintained. If this major principle is also overthrown, then our policies, this major principle, and its connection with our rights and our hopes will all be overturned.]</p>
<h3>British and American War Debt Negotiations</h3>
<p>The Deadline is Extended to After April</p>
<p>Reuters London Telegram on the 1st: According to news here today, the war debt negotiations between the UK and the US in Washington must be delayed until April or later before they can begin. Since President Roosevelt will not take office until March 4, the representatives of the two countries can open discussions on war debts in Washington after that. The fact that the new government has many matters to deal with has inevitably delayed the opening date, and the question of who will be the British representative at the negotiations is also related to the delayed opening date, as British Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain, who is directly related to war debts, will be constrained by the budget in April and may not be able to leave the UK.</p>
<h3>Full Mobilization Campaign of All Agencies Under the Japanese Ministry of Education</h3>

<h3>Lang Guanpu and Others Arrive in Shanghai and Suzhou en Route to Western Europe to Return Home</h3>
<p>The Strength of the Northeast Military-Civilian Cooperative Volunteer Army Still Exists</p>
<p>Ding Chao Loses His Integrity in His Later Years and Has Surrendered to the Puppet State</p>
<p>Lang and Others Are Scheduled to Enter Beijing Next Week to Report to the Central Government</p>
<p>Lang Guanpu, Acting Chairman of Heilongjiang Province and Director of the Finance Department; Zhou Weitai, Director of the Industry Department; Zhou Deyu, Secretary-General; Ke Yin, Confidential Secretary; You Sui, Chief Secretary; Zhang Linsui, Chief of Staff of the Deputy Commander-in-Chief's Office; Wu Yuandan, Adjutant General; Li Pizu, Director of the General Staff Office; Tu Binqing, Member of the Provincial Party Department; and more than 40 others arrived in Shanghai on the 27th aboard the Soviet Russian Tongli freighter. Mr. Lang is scheduled to enter Beijing next week to report to the central government on the situation in the Northeast. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency visited Mr. Zhou Weitai at his residence yesterday and learned about the difficult situation experienced by Mr. Zhou and others on their way to Shanghai. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Difficulties on the Journey</h3>
<p>According to the interview, after retreating from Heihe, they inquired about the road to Vladivostok, and were fortunate enough to borrow empty houses from our consulate in Vladivostok to survive the hunger and cold. There were Japanese ships traveling from Vladivostok to Shanghai every week, but they were bound to encounter disadvantages, so they decided to take a Russian ship to Shanghai. However, the Russian ship only carried cargo and did not carry passengers. After several negotiations, they were finally allowed to board. However, the Tongli ship, which was scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on January 18th, did not depart for Shanghai until around February 20th, delaying for more than 30 days. More than 40 people traveling together boarded this cargo ship to Shanghai, and the hardships were unbearable.</p>
<p>The Anti-Japanese troops who retreated into Russian territory included more than 2,000 men from Su Bingwen's unit and more than 1,000 men from Li Du and Wang Delin's units. As for Chairman Ma's troops, they have been handed over to his subordinates to command, and the current situation is unclear. As for the volunteer armies lurking in the mountains and forests of the eastern provinces, there are still 40,000 to 50,000 people. Although they can avoid hunger and cold, they lack ammunition and their strength is not great. Fortunately, the people of the Northeast have always been in close contact with the volunteers. If there is a shortage, as required by the volunteers, they will do their best to supply it. In the future, when our army goes out to conquer, it may not be a helpful force.</p>
<h3>Ding Chao Loses His Integrity</h3>
<p>As for Ding Chao, he did not retreat into Russian territory, nor was he arrested. It is rumored that he has surrendered to the puppet state. It is a great pity that he lost his integrity in his later years. As for the more than 40 people who came south, we can only leave it up to those who cannot share the same ideals.</p>
<h3>The Whereabouts of Su and Ma</h3>
<p>When we came to Shanghai, we heard in Vladivostok that Generals Su Bingwen and Ma Zhanshan had passed through Moscow and were on their way to Western Europe, taking a ship back to China via France. However, upon arriving in Shanghai, there was no news of them. Wu Huanzhang, Mr. Ma's representative in Shanghai, has already sent a telegram to Deputy Chairman Zhang in Beiping and the National Government in Nanjing, inquiring about the whereabouts of the two men. No reply has been received as of today.</p>
<h3>Lang Will Enter Beijing</h3>
<p>Since we came to Shanghai, we have felt quite tired, so we are taking a short rest in Shanghai. Acting Chairman Lang will enter Beijing next week to report to the central government on the situation in the three northeastern provinces. It is undecided whether I and others will go to Beijing.</p>
<h3>Reflecting on the Past and Thinking About the Present</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhou finally said that in the Battle of Nenjiang Bridge, General Ma fought a desperate battle with the Japanese. In the Battle of Hailar, General Su faced a situation where the Japanese forces in the eastern provinces had not yet been firmly established, and the volunteer army was also very strong. If our army could resist the enemy and leave the pass, we could attack from both sides, and the Japanese would be exhausted to cope with it. Even if we could not completely wipe out the enemy, we could inflict heavy damage. It would not be impossible to unify command, fight with the enemy, and recover the three northeastern provinces. Now, there is no hope of it.</p>

<h3>The Consequences of Withdrawing from the League of Nations as Seen by the Japanese (Japanese Correspondence)</h3>
<p>Everyone knows that the so-called [public opinion] in Japan is the [public opinion] of the Japanese nation under the command of the military. It is almost like a movement on the exercise field, but it is definitely not an expression of the people's will, but a phenomenon forced out by a very small number of militarists using military force and terror (assassination methods), etc. However, there are also occasional arguments that are truly loyal to Japan and have vision. Since the League of Nations' Committee of Nineteen put forward the draft report, Japanese public opinion has been divided into two major categories. The first category fully supports the military's aggressive behavior or deliberately flatters the military's behavior. The second category has a sense of opposition but does not dare to express it publicly. Even if they write articles, they cannot be fully published. The first category includes major newspapers, major magazines, and the Japanese government under the command of the military. The second category includes writers, politicians, and revolutionaries in the opposition. Among the first category, what they say is always the same old stuff: (1) saying that the League of Nations' understanding of Eastern issues is insufficient; (2) saying that China is in chaos; (3) saying that they are preventing [reddening]; (4) saying that Japan's use of force in [Manchuria] is the initiation of the [right of self-defense]; (5) saying that maintaining the [Manchurian (puppet) state] is maintaining peace in East Asia.</p>
<p>The Osaka Asahi has an even more ridiculous statement, saying, "[For thirteen years,] Japan has been a loyal member of the League of Nations and has a sacred belief in the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the Nine-Power Treaty… but in the exceptional circumstances of China, the principles and reality of the various treaties must be reconsidered." However, it advocates caution regarding Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations.</p>
<p>However, the Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun is different. It believes that [being] isolated and helpless, and going its own way is glorious. It knows that the atmosphere of the League of Nations is extremely unfavorable to Japan. At the meeting, everyone except Japan was going to vote in favor of the report of the Committee of Nineteen. It still believes that Japan should withdraw from the League of Nations and advance vigorously according to its established policy - supporting Manchuria to attack Jehol. At the same time, it also boasted to the League of Nations that [during the World War, Japan held a] altruistic attitude. Although the war was centered on Europe, the United Nations would not have achieved a great victory without Japan's assistance. Indeed, the United States' participation in the war gave the United Nations a decisive opportunity for a great victory. If Japan had not participated in the war, the United States would never have been able to participate… This section of the speech implicitly expresses Japan's hegemony in the Pacific and contains a hint of challenge.</p>
<p>The Yomiuri Shimbun said, "[…The original cause of the Manchurian problem was that] China, which did not have the qualifications of the League of Nations and was not a unified country, had the right to rule in Manchuria, which caused the trouble… Now that Japan is adjacent to the Eastern nation and the Chinese region, this is a major issue of life and death for (Japan). If it is handled incorrectly, it will really be like (what Uchida said) turning the entire (Japan) country into scorched earth… Therefore, Japan cannot accept the advice of the League of Nations, and it is inevitable to withdraw from the League of Nations…" Since they all believe that it is inevitable to withdraw from the League of Nations, then does it have no concerns about diplomacy and economy? According to Yamakawa Tomio (Director of the Legislation Bureau during the Kato Takaaki cabinet, now a member of the House of Peers), his answer is:</p>
<p>[The resolution of the League of Nations Administrative Council two years ago with thirteen votes to one,] and the resolution adopted by the League of Nations General Assembly last March in which Japan gave up its right to vote, and the recent draft of the Committee of Nineteen, the world's public opinion, are all criticizing Japan. In normal times, Japan should consider world public opinion, but if world public opinion is wrong, Japan has no need to consider it… Therefore, applying Article 15, Paragraph 4 of the Covenant, I (Japan) have nothing to fear, but can use this to make the League of Nations understand the situation in the East…</p>
<p>Also, like Fujiwara Ginjiro (who has a very deep relationship with Mitsui, president of Oji Paper), he is currently a member of the House of Peers. After Japan withdraws from the League of Nations, if it causes a serious backlash and leads to economic sanctions against Japan by various countries, what will Japan do? His opinion is:</p>
<p>[…The United States imposes heavy taxes on Japanese raw silk (staging)] a semi-sanctioned economic state. Europe also imposes heavy taxes on Japanese cotton cloth, cotton products, rayon, and other sundries. Is this enough to besiege Japan? If it is realized, Japan can also impose heavy taxes on American cotton and retaliate. The same is true for Europe… [As for complete economic] sanctions, unless it is as extremely deteriorated as during the European war when all countries were against Germany, it is only a theoretical and pleasant term. It is very difficult to implement in reality…</p>
<p>[…Furthermore, if China long-term harms Japanese trade,] and various countries assist China, Japan can delineate the so-called northern Chinese regions from Qingdao to Tianjin - north of the Yangtze River - as Japan's sphere of influence to develop business, and move the trade that was formerly in Shanghai to Qingdao. Losing the south, but making up for it with the north. There is no need to be polite. Free action should be taken in Tianjin, Beiping, and Shandong Province, taking self-defense measures. In the future, it is feared that it will increase even more than China's current production…</p>
<p>Mogi Heibei) is a rising industrialist. He has the following views on the Manchurian Incident this time, especially on the withdrawal from the League of Nations:</p>
<p>[…I do not want to discuss the future of Manchuria.]… However, the policy of imperialism has now completely failed. If the emerging Japan repeats its mistakes, will it be detrimental or beneficial to Japanese diplomacy? There is no need to say more.</p>
<p>[Japan's future foreign policy has two paths. One is the policy of] internationalism, and the other is the continental policy of imperialism. Japan must of course use one of them to determine its economic policy. Now that the once-developed European and American imperialism is about to be liquidated, is it worth considering whether Japan can adopt this approach? If Japan forcibly wants to grasp hegemony in the East and adopt the Monroe Doctrine of East Asia, the result is that it may not be possible to grasp hegemony in the East. The United States of North America and Labor and Peasants' Russia both occupy strong positions outside the League of Nations. Japan has nothing to fear from them. However, Japan's current problem is the China problem…</p>
<p>[…After Japan withdraws from the League of Nations, will it be able to] freely exercise its [continental policy]? If it withdraws from the League of Nations and encounters economic sanctions, the right to rule should be regarded as another issue. Japan's position in the world will encounter an even more difficult situation than before… Moreover, economically speaking, in terms of international relations, there is absolutely no hope of solving Japan's economic problems without peaceful methods… [If Japan goes to war with a certain country, then the whole world] will be Japan's enemy. Even a temporary military victory is not enough to be the glory of the country. The World War is a very good example of practical education. It is nothing more than the same result obtained by the advanced German Empire in launching the war. Moreover, modern warfare is to determine the final victory with economic power. How much strength does Japan's economic power have? Early experts have researched and discussed it. Is there the confidence to be an enemy of the whole world? … The collapse of the German Empire… Although big capitalists will praise war and induce war, they must know that they must take care of the world situation now, but war will bring about their own flaws…</p>
<p>Arata Kanshura has turned from an anarchist to a [Bolshevik]. Recently, he has had a strong tendency towards Fascism. However, although his views are not brilliant, they can represent the urgent thinking in the right wing. He believes that:</p>
<p>[…The capitalist class is also unwilling to abandon international coordination and willingly isolate itself.] Only the military insists on withdrawing from the League of Nations… The reason why the military is so tough is because of the traditional policies of the military阀, which is not surprising… If Japan withdraws from the League of Nations, it will give the United States the opportunity to be closely connected with the League of Nations. Moreover, the initiation of the League of Nations was the idea of ​​the late Democratic President Wilson. I am afraid that in the future, the issue of the United States joining the League of Nations may be raised again…</p>
<p>[Therefore, Japan's long-term friendship is completely isolated, like] Germany before the European war. In the future, the United States will open an encirclement line against Japan…</p>
<p>Hasegawa Nyozekan has always maintained a critical attitude. He even believes that (Japan) is a blind impulse, [the possibility of a] nation in the late stage of capitalism overcoming the contradiction between instinct and reason is very small…</p>
<p>[…(The Japanese general public) on the one hand wants to support its special] continental policy, and on the other hand, because this policy causes Japan's national finances to fall into crisis, this is acknowledged by financial experts and general newspapers… It is also an undeniable fact…</p>
<p>The above is indeed too simple, but it is generally enough to peek at the general public opinion in Japan. February 25, 1933, Koishikawa, Tokyo</p>

<h3>Progress of Transportation Construction in Anhui Province</h3>
<p>Construction of the Hangzhou-Huizhou Highway</p>
<p>The Wu-Dujiang Ferry Has Also Been Opened to Navigation Wuyuan Correspondence, Anhui Province's highways, the Jing-Wu and Hangzhou-Huizhou lines, are extremely important because they are related to military transportation. The Jing-Wu roadbed has long been built, but the road surface pavement stones will not be completed until the end of April. The Jing-Wu West Section Long-Distance Bus Company has purchased large and small passenger and cargo vehicles and transported them to Wu. As soon as the road surface is completed, it will be officially opened to traffic. Long-distance telephones are now being installed. The Huizhou-Hangzhou line is 60 kilometers long. The Anhui Construction Department was previously instructed by Generalissimo Chiang to divide the construction with Zhejiang Province, each responsible for 30 kilometers, and to borrow 9 kilometers of funds from the National Economic Commission to start construction first. The part to be built by Anhui Province has also been organized into an engineering office to be responsible for rushing the construction, and Ding Gongnan has been appointed as the chief engineer. Liu Yiwu, Director of the Anhui Construction Department, after attending the Seven-Province Highway Conference in Beijing, went to Hangzhou to contact the Zhejiang Construction Department on everything, and then returned to Beijing with Zhao Zukang, Director of the Highway Department of the National Economic Commission, Ao Jinshi, West Engineer, and Qin Fen, Director of the Tax Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance. They took a car from Beijing along the Jing-Wu Highway to Wu to inspect the construction situation in the Caishi-Dangtu section. They arrived in Wu at 1:00 pm. Zhao and others returned to Beijing by the original car, while Liu changed to a river steamer and returned directly to Anqing. Also, the Erba Dam across the Wu-Yuan River is the main route for people traveling to and from Wuwu, Jiao County, and other counties in Jiangbei. People can only rely on very small civilian boats to cross the river to Wu. Whenever there are strong winds and waves, there are frequent accidents and shipwrecks. Therefore, the Anhui Construction Department ordered the Wu-Zhejiang Engineering Bureau to prepare a ferry. The bureau rented a Chunjiang small steamer and started sailing today. The north bank wharf is at Erba, and the south bank borrows from near the China Merchants Wharf. It runs every 30 minutes, and the fare is 20 copper coins per person.

<p>It Is Unfair for Britain to Ban the Export of Arms; We Should Protest</p>
<p>Advocate Recalling the Ambassador to Japan and Preparing to Break Off Diplomatic Relations</p>
<p>The Russian Ambassador Will Come to China After Meeting Yan Huiqing</p>
<p>All Treaties Privately Concluded by Japan and the Puppet State Are Invalid</p>
<p>Wu Chaochu, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, returned to Shanghai from Beijing this morning. The reporter made a special visit to Mr. Wu at his residence and asked for his opinion on the British ban on the export of arms to both China and Japan and the severance of diplomatic relations with Japan. He replied in detail as follows:</p>
<h3>The Issue of Arms Embargo</h3>
<p>According to Mr. Wu, the British embargo on arms exports to both China and Japan seems to be impartial on the surface, but it is not. This is because Japan not only has huge military stockpiles, but can also manufacture them itself. China is the opposite and has no stockpiles at all. It has to buy them from other countries. It is also heard that Japan recently ordered a large batch of arms from Britain. This is also because the order was placed before the embargo and is not subject to the embargo. Therefore, the British embargo on arms exports to both China and Japan is tantamount to punishing an innocent country and assisting an invading country. Japan is an aggressor country, and our country is an invaded country. Japan is guilty, and China is innocent. This is a fact that the League of Nations has already determined. It is unfair for Britain not to impose an arms embargo on Japan alone, but to impose an embargo on both China and Japan. At present, our country can only raise objections to Britain and strive for justice based on reason.</p>
<h3>Advocate Recalling the Ambassador</h3>
<p>Mr. Wu continued, regarding the issue of severing diplomatic relations with Japan, Mr. Wu said, before discussing this issue, we must first recognize that severing diplomatic relations and recalling the ambassador are two different things. Severing diplomatic relations will of course recall the ambassador, but recalling the ambassador does not necessarily mean severing diplomatic relations. Since Japan is actively invading China, there is of course no diplomatic compromise to be made. For the sake of our country's personality, I advocate that our country should immediately recall its ambassador to Japan and at the same time prepare to sever diplomatic relations with Japan. This is because severing diplomatic relations is a major issue and preparations must be made in advance.</p>
<h3>Substantive Sanctions by the League of Nations</h3>
<p>After the League of Nations passes the report drafted by the Committee of Nineteen, what kind of action will it take? Will it be substantive sanctions or empty words? This is a mystery that people all over the world are paying attention to. The reporter made a special inquiry about Mr. Wu's opinion. Mr. Wu replied that the League of Nations itself has no strength. The strength of the League of Nations is the strength of its member states. Whether the League of Nations can substantively sanction Japan depends on whether the member states of the League of Nations have this determination, especially whether the member states related to the Far East have this determination.</p>
<h3>The Russian Ambassador is About to Arrive in China</h3>
<p>Mr. Wu continued, telling reporters, "The League of Nations has invited the United States and Russia to participate in the Advisory Committee. Will Soviet Russia accept the invitation? No one can say for sure at present. Today's newspapers report that Soviet Russia has attached two conditions to participating in the Advisory Committee: one is that the United States must participate at the same time, and the other is that the United States must recognize Soviet Russia. If this is indeed the case, the first condition seems to be guaranteed, and the second also has hope. It is likely that Soviet Russia will accept the invitation to participate in the League of Nations Advisory Committee. As for the Soviet Russian Ambassador to China, Mr. Bogomolov, he must wait until he meets with our Ambassador Yan in Moscow before setting off for China. Mr. Yan will arrive in Moscow in the next day or two, so the date of the Russian ambassador's arrival in China is not far off."</p>
<h3>The Treaty Signed by Japan and the Puppet Regime is Invalid</h3>
<p>Subsequently, the reporter asked Mr. Wu about the issue of the South Manchuria Railway Company signing a contract with the puppet organization to completely entrust the management of the Northeast Railway to the South Manchuria Railway. Mr. Wu stated to the reporter unequivocally, "All treaties signed by Japan and the puppet regime, apart from their private relationship, are of course absolutely invalid in the international arena."</p>
<h3>The Rehe War is Proceeding Smoothly</h3>
<p>When the reporter took his leave, he also inquired about the situation of the war in Rehe. According to the information Mr. Wu obtained while in Beijing, the war in Rehe is proceeding exceptionally smoothly, and the soldiers are all performing their duties faithfully. Dean Song Dai and Mr. Li Xiehe (Lie Gou) will be going to Peiping (Beijing) soon, while he himself will remain in Shanghai, only going to Beijing to attend meetings of the Foreign Affairs Committee.</p>
<h3>Song Ziwen Arrived in Shanghai This Morning</h3>
<p>Guo Chengen Visited to Report on the Minting of New Currency</p>
<p>Acting President of the Executive Yuan, Mr. Song Ziwen, accompanied by his secretary Huang Chundao, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing this morning at 6:00 AM on the Fushi aircraft. He arrived at the Hongqiao Airport at 8:30 AM and immediately returned to his residence to rest. At around 10:00 AM, the director of the Central Mint, Guo Chengen, was summoned to visit and report on the progress of the minting of new currency.</p>
<h3>Employees of the Two Railways Plan to Raise 150,000 Yuan to Purchase a "Two Railways" Aircraft</h3>
<p>丨Organize the Two Railways Air Defense Preparatory Committee丨</p>
<p>Employees of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo railways, recognizing the urgency of foreign aggression and the importance of using aviation to save the country, have organized the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Air Defense Preparatory Committee. The first meeting was held yesterday, and the organizational charter was approved. Chen Chengshi, Li Dazhi, and Yuan Boyang were elected as executive committee members and standing committee members.

<h3>North Ocean Commercial Transportation: All Chinese Ships Have Suspended Service to Tianjin</h3>
<p>Since the news of the Japanese Navy blockading the mouth of the Baihe River spread, Tianjin merchants have stopped handling goods one after another. The Japanese Navy Ministry is using the excuse that Yu Xuezhong sunk merchant ships outside Dagukou to obstruct navigation, so a squadron of warships dispatched from Sasebo is heading to North China and will arrive in Qingdao tomorrow, making the situation even more serious. Various Chinese shipping companies in this port have suspended the North Ocean route after consulting each other today, because there is no freight to Tianjin and the situation is tense again. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has decided that, after the Yu Shun ship sails to Tianjin this time, if there is no cargo to go, it will temporarily suspend service. All other temporary North Ocean ships have also suspended service.</p>
<h3>A Large Batch of Inferior Goods Arrived in This City Today</h3>
<p>Value over 500,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Japanese merchants in Shanghai telegraphed their home country to rush a large batch of inferior goods to Shanghai to prevent future maritime transport disruptions and sales obstacles. The first batch of rushed inferior goods arrived in Shanghai today, totaling 23,379 pieces. Another 2,015 pieces were transferred to Hankou, transported by the Tsukuba Maru. The main items include Dongtang sugar, seafood, rubber products, electrical materials, porcelain, and piece goods, with a value of over 500,000 yuan, and are already being unloaded.</p>
<h3>Liang Shiyi is About to Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Liang Shiyi, the former Minister of Communications and Minister of Finance, has been living in seclusion in Hong Kong since retiring from his political career, not concerning himself with current affairs. Recently, seeing the urgency of foreign aggression and the severity of the national crisis, and that the central government is extending invitations to talents from all sides to jointly discuss plans to save the country, Liang Shiyi specifically left Hong Kong on the Coolidge, a ship of the Dollar Steamship Lines, the day before yesterday, bound for Shanghai, and then to Beijing and Peiping. According to news from the company, the ship will arrive at Songkou tonight and at Yangshupu at 8:30 AM tomorrow morning, where it will anchor.</p>
<h3>Representatives from Peiping and Tianjin Universities Report on Anti-Japanese Work in the North</h3>
<p>Speeches at the City Education Bureau Today</p>
<p>Attendees were Presidents of Universities and Middle Schools</p>
<p>The Joint Association of Faculty and Staff of National Universities in Peiping and Tianjin sent four representatives to contact the education circles nationwide and unite to resist Japan. Mr. Mou Mo is responsible for the Shandong, Beijing, Shanghai, and Zhejiang regions and arrived in Shanghai from Beijing the day before yesterday. This morning at 10:00 AM, the Shanghai City Education Bureau convened a meeting of presidents of public and private universities and middle schools in the city in the auditorium so that Mr. Mou could report on everything. More than 100 presidents from various schools attended, and Director Pan presided over the meeting. After giving an introductory speech, Representative Mou reported on the tense situation in Rehe and the anti-Japanese work in the North, saying that the universities in Peiping and Tianjin had all started school on February 8, and the anti-Japanese work of the students in each school was quite tense. He also said that he had contacted the education circles in Jinan and Nanjing with great success, and he hoped that the education circles in Shanghai would unite so that the education circles nationwide could establish a general association to communicate with the front lines and supply the soldiers with needed items, and that it was especially important to unite in a calm manner to resist Japan. He also hoped that Chairman Chiang and Minister of Military Affairs He could go north to resist Japan. The meeting adjourned after 12:00 noon. It is reported that Mr. Mou is currently at the YMCA in Eight Immortals Bridge and will go to Zhejiang to contact the education circles.</p>
<h3>Duan Qirui is About to Go to Hangzhou for Sightseeing</h3>
<p>丨Duan's Family Members Will Also Go South丨</p>
<p>Since moving into his new residence on Avenue Joffre, Mr. Duan Qirui has been living in seclusion, rarely interacting with outsiders. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Mr. Qian Xinzhi at the Four Banks Joint Treasury this morning to inquire about Mr. Duan's recent situation. According to him, Mr. Wang Yitang will come to Shanghai from Tianjin within the next few days to visit Mr. Duan. Mr. Duan's family members will also be escorted south by Mr. Wang and plan to live in Shanghai for a long time. Mr. Duan himself has long admired the scenery of West Lake and wanted to visit the Three Tirthankaras when he arrived in Shanghai. Now that the weather is gradually warming, he will go for a visit within the next few days.</p>
<h3>Exhibitors Consult Today on How to Handle the Cancellation of Participation in the Chicago Exposition</h3>
<p>No fewer than 20,000 items were collected for this participation in the Chicago Exposition. Now that the government has ordered the Ministry of Industry to cancel participation due to the urgency of the national crisis, the participating merchants are quite dissatisfied because they believe that after the collected items are transported to Chicago, American people will definitely buy many of them. Therefore, it has been decided to convene all exhibitors at the International Trade Bureau at 2:00 PM today to discuss solutions.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Going to Japan are Expelled</h3>
<p>Japanese People are Utterly Irrational</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Fei Xiaochun, Li Zizhang, Chen Xiongtu, etc., who went to Japan from Shanghai, were detained by the Japanese water police at the port of Kobe, who said that they had no entry permits and were not allowed to land. The overseas Chinese were detained in the police station, imprisoned for two days and nights, and subjected to humiliation and beatings. Yesterday, they were escorted back to Shanghai on a Japanese ship. Fei and others arrived in Shanghai today in a very embarrassing state.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Government Sends Military Officers and Diplomats to Shanghai</h3>
<p>丨Some Contact Has Been Made丨</p>
<p>The Japanese specially dispatched Army Major Hiroshi Nemoto as a representative of the Army Ministry to Shanghai to contact the local Japanese military authorities on important matters. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs also sent special agent Taro Nakamura to Shanghai to carry out secret activities. All arrived in Shanghai today.</p>
<h3>Various Groups Aiding the Northeast will Convene a Joint Meeting Today</h3>
<h3>Please Xiong Xiling to Report on the Situation at the Front</h3>
<p>Various Shanghai groups aiding anti-Japanese soldiers and refugees from the Northeast Volunteer Army have long wanted to convene a joint meeting to discuss unified measures. Taking advantage of the presence in Shanghai of Xiong Bingxun and Huang Renzhi, directors of the Northeast and Rehe Support Association, and Mou Mo, a representative of the Joint Association of Faculty and Staff of National Universities in Peiping and Tianjin, the Shanghai Local Association will host a meeting at 4:00 PM today. Xiong Bingxun, who has just returned from inspecting the front lines, will be invited to attend and report on the situation at the front so that discussions can be held. The groups invited to attend include the Northeast Association and other groups.</p>
<h3>The Northeast and Rehe Support Association Asks Compatriots to Contribute Money to Save the Country</h3>
<p>The Peiping Northeast and Rehe Support Association telegraphed various public organizations in this city yesterday, saying, "To our fellow countrymen, we are deeply aware of the urgency of the national crisis. We established the Northeast and Rehe Support Association in Peiping on the 20th with the aim of concentrating the people's strength to resist Japan and supporting the soldiers at the front. We telegraphed this matter to you on the 20th. However, the matters related to assistance, as the name suggests, cannot be accomplished without funds. This matter is of great importance and cannot be accomplished by one person's efforts. The military situation on the Rehe border is extremely tense, and supplies are urgently needed. We hope that everyone will rise up together and generously donate. At this critical moment, it is time for our countrymen to contribute money to relieve the national crisis. We earnestly present our words and await your generous donations. After donating, please hand over the donations to various branches of the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Jin City Bank, Continental Bank, and Shanghai Bank for remittance. We attach this list. Sincerely, Zhu Qinglan, Zhou Zuomin, Zhang Boling, Zhu Qiqian, Xiong Xiling, Jiang Menglin, Zhou Yichun, Hu Shi, Wang Liao, Zhang Xian, permanent directors of the Northeast and Rehe Support Association."</p>
<h3>The Municipal Government Orders the Social Affairs Bureau to Thoroughly Investigate the Zhengtai Yonghe Tragedy</h3>
<p>Strict Inspections Should be Conducted in Other Factories in the City</p>
<p>Since the steam tank explosions at the Zhengtai Rubber Factory on Tangshan Road and the Yonghe Rubber Factory in Zhabei, people from all walks of life, both Chinese and foreign, have paid close attention. The Municipal Government yesterday instructed the Social Affairs Bureau to conduct a thorough investigation and report, stating, "As an order, after investigating the accident at the Zhengtai Rubber Factory, which resulted in multiple deaths and injuries, another incident of electric leakage and boiler explosion occurred at the Yonghe Rubber Factory in Zhabei, resulting in multiple deaths and injuries. This is extremely shocking. The Bureau is instructed to thoroughly investigate and report on the causes of the accidents and the usual management of each factory within a specified period. Strict inspections should also be conducted in other factories in the city to prevent accidents and protect human lives. This is an order."</p>
<h3>Chen Hexian Will Arrive in Shanghai on the 18th</h3>
<p>Cheng Qibao, Yang Lian, Guo Youshou, Li Ximou, and others, a group of five special envoys sent by the Ministry of Education to study education in Europe and America, went abroad last year to study in Italy, France, and the Nordic countries. Recently, they went to the Soviet Union to study emerging education and gained a lot. It has been reported that Chang Lian and Guo Youshou arrived in Vladivostok on the 26th of the previous month and are waiting for a ship to return to China. Chen Hexian, the Chinese representative attending the World New Education Conference, has boarded the Italian ship Trieste and set off for China, traveling on the same ship as Wang Jingwei. He will arrive in Shanghai on the 18th.</p>
<h3>Customs Announces Tax Exemption for Native Goods and Machine-Made Products</h3>
<p>The Jianghai Customs announced today that native goods transported to the interior will not be subject to transit tax. The regular tax, which was previously required to be collected on machine-made goods transported to the interior, will also be exempted. However, this measure does not apply to goods subject to consolidated tax.</p>
<h3>Tram Fares in the French Concession Will Increase</h3>
<p>Approximately Four Copper Coins More Per Route</p>
<p>According to the Japanese Shanghai Daily, the French Concession Water and Electricity Company has decided to increase the tram fares within the French Concession (regardless of whether they are trams or trolleybuses). The increase will be approximately four copper coins per route. It was originally scheduled to take effect on March 1, but the fare schedule has not yet been reviewed by the French Concession authorities, so it will have to be delayed for a few days. According to the French Concession Water and Electricity Company, since last year, the population in the French Concession has suddenly increased, and the business has developed, with the administrative department collecting more than 100,000 yuan per month, the lighting department more than 300,000 yuan, and the water department 150,000 yuan, averaging more than 1 million yuan more per year. Therefore, the price of French Concession stocks has also increased more than tenfold.</p>
<h3>The Chief of the Shangbao Stamp Tax Bureau Embezzles Tax Money</h3>
<p>The Chief of the Stamp Tax Bureau Has Been Detained for Collecting Taxes in the Concession</p>
<p>Xu Zhicheng, Chief of the Shangbao Stamp Tax Sub-Bureau, has recently abused his authority to collect stamp tax outside the jurisdiction and has embezzled all the proceeds. For example, the purchase and affixing of stamps by businesses in the Public Concession has always been the responsibility of the Special Zone Stamp Inspection Office established by the Ministry of Finance. A few days ago, when officials from the office were ordered to conduct investigations in various places, they found that the books of the Lilli Automobile Company, Xiang Sheng Automobile Company, and Xinzha Automobile Company had not been stamped in accordance with the regulations. The amount of tax evaded totaled more than 500 yuan. Therefore, the Inspection Office, in accordance with the agreement with the Concession authorities, consulted the police and reported the matter to the First Special District Local Court in accordance with the law. Summonses have been issued to summon the managers of the three automobile companies for questioning. At that time, the defendants presented receipts issued by the Shangbao Stamp Tax Sub-Bureau and stated that the stamp tax should be paid.</p>

<h3>Factories Should Have Safety Equipment</h3>
<p>— A Person</p>
<p>A few days ago, at the Zhengtai Rubber Factory on Tangshan Road, the motor wires short-circuited, and the steam tank exploded. In an instant, more than a hundred people died in the raging flames with tragic cries and howls! According to reports, of the 270 workers in the entire factory, only 100 managed to escape, while the rest were buried in the fire pit. A few days later, the steam tank at the Yonghe Company also exploded, killing and injuring more than 40 men and women and destroying 17 workshops. Within a few days, two tragic accidents occurred in machine rooms, the situation of which was as tragic as the fire at the Zhabei Military Garment Factory four years ago, which burned hundreds of people to death.</p>
<p>In today's era of machine industry factories, workers in factories are constantly in danger of losing their lives. The factory should have sufficient and complete preparation and training for safety facilities in peacetime, so that there will be no accidents, or even if they occur, they will not be so tragic that hundreds of people die at once! The unfortunate tragic changes this time were indeed accidental and sudden and could not have been foreseen by human affairs. The situation at Yonghe is still unknown, but according to those familiar with the inside story of the Zhengtai factory, the factory buildings were not suitable for factory construction, and safety equipment was especially neglected, and they are always tightly closed (this point, it is difficult to fathom the depth of their intentions!). In times of crisis, workers not only cannot rely on equipment to save themselves, but also have nowhere to go and fall into the fire together! The authorities directly responsible for the entire factory cannot face the workers who died in this disaster and the people in society.</p>
<p>Frankly speaking, workers who cannot even fill their stomachs after working all day cannot even talk about welfare, and they must also be prepared to lose their lives in vain. How can this be justified? Therefore, when the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau begins to investigate factories throughout the city, please strictly enforce Articles 41 and 42 of the Factory Law, pay special attention to the safety equipment in factories, and ban factories that do not care about worker welfare and only do their best to exploit and squeeze workers to obtain profits. After the great lesson learned from the Zhengtai factory this time, should we still follow the old ways?</p>

<h3>Lament for the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Cao Zucan</p>
<p>The three Korean provinces are deeply distressing. The three provinces of our great nation are poorly defended. The enemy advances like a tide, taking advantage of the situation. Martyrs are willing to die with the sun. Beacon fires fill the sky, connecting to the sea. The mountains and rivers have no boundaries, and jackals run rampant. I wish to use the tears of sorrow for the times that fill my eyes to sprinkle across the old battlefield in Liaodong.</p>
<p>What can the masses do in their panic? The generals still sing and dance under the lamp. The world is alarmed by the overwhelming disaster. The whole country strives to wave the setting sun banner. It is useless to talk about Fan and Han's talent. How can we bear to see Liaoshen shedding so many tears? Once the crisis is triggered, it intensifies now. Who can rise to stem the tide in the middle?</p>

<h3>Neon Lights</h3>
<p>— A Tang</p>
<p>"Neon lights" are very common in Shanghai. Almost every theater and larger store and bar has neon light installations, and in literary works describing Avenue Joffre, neon lights also occupy a very important position. Now let's talk about the structure and principle of neon lights.</p>
<p>Many gases, when sealed in a vacuum glass tube and then energized, cause the entire tube to emit light. The color of the light varies with the type of gas. For example, if the tube contains carbon dioxide, it emits white light. Neon lights are also based on this principle. The atmosphere contains a free gas called neon (Neon), which is a colorless, odorless gas that does not easily combine with other elements and is very rare, accounting for only one or two ten-thousandths of the atmospheric volume. This is the raw material for neon lights.</p>
<p>Now let's talk about the structure of neon lights. A glass tube with a diameter of 15 millimeters (one millimeter is one-thousandth of a meter) is bent into various pictures and words. The places where each word connects are painted with black paint. Two metal electrodes are sealed into both ends. A vacuum pump is then used to create a high vacuum. A small amount of neon is injected. A voltage of 5,000 to 10,000 volts is applied to the two electrodes, and red light is emitted due to discharge. This is the neon light on the market. However, neon lights on the market are not entirely red. Adding a small amount of mercury vapor to the tube emits blue light. If a yellow glass tube is used, it becomes green. If the light emitted by the tube is red and the tube is yellow, it becomes orange. Therefore, neon lights can be made into various different colors using various methods.</p>
<h3>Dead, Alive, False, Hypocritical</h3>
<p>— Zhi Qin</p>
<p>In this era of survival, which only talks about empty appearances and ignores reality, both society and individuals have a nature of hypocrisy and cunning. Not to mention the living, even the dead have to put on an empty show and pretend. This kind of behavior of deceiving others and oneself is enough to make foreigners laugh to death. If you don't believe me, take a look.</p>
