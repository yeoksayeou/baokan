<p>東報指係受蘇聯唆使</p>
<p>俄報則稱中心在東京</p>
<p>（莫斯科）今日蘇聯政府公報「伊斯維斯太」對於大坂朝日新聞所載指稱新疆回亂受蘇聯影響之論文加以評論、該報稱、對於是項顯然背謬之指責、是否能予信任、實屬可疑、緣人固週知此項叛變、乃在聯絡四民反抗漢人之口號下進行、而煽動該項運動之訊回敎集團、其中心適在東京也、此等集團已刋印報紙一種、分發全體回民、伊斯維斯大報申稱、「大坂朝日報深知土爾其被放逐之王子阿勃得爾凱林姆（前王阿勃得爾哈米特之孫）、刻正在東京積極準備、如新疆回亂成功、彼即接受新疆之統治、並經提議委派若干活躍之日本軍官及土耳其逃亡者、以重整此王子之實力」、該報結論謂、「昨日爲東京陰謀家爪牙之回敎叛亂者已被挫敗、故大坂朝日報急爲日本被攻擊之黨羽洗刷、而嫁罪於蘇聯」云、（十七日塔斯社電）</p>

<h3>汪院長在行政院演講</h3>
<p>（南京）行政院十七日晨紀念週、汪院長演講「以建設求統一」、略謂、曩年在廣州、曾提出「以建設求統一」的主張、當時無反響、近在京偶然提及、引起滬報鄭重討論、故就原來主張、申述幾句以建設求統一、是否可行、建設是否可以求統一、未統一前是否有建設的可能、統一之反響、乃分裂對抗、對抗中央以外、還有各地方互相對抗或同一地方兩個以上之勢力互相對抗、對抗形勢存在、則兩方均爭相擴張軍備、甲添兵乙也添兵、竭百姓指膏、庫帑收入不足爲擴張軍備之用、自無餘力以謀建設、今欲以建設求統一、豈非緣木求魚、此予所假設的駁論、我答辯如下、如有對抗形勢則能建設者勝、即能統一、不能建設者敗、必被掃除、譬有兩對抗形勢、甲注意建設、則必注意人民的生產力之發達及解除人民之束縛與困苦、故在政治上、必厲行廉潔、不中飽不貪婪、在軍事上嚴紀律、不擾民、人民生命財產旣有保障從事農業建設農民生產力發達、購買力增加、工商業、建設亦因以活潑進行、臻於發達、因民力充實而國力亦隨以充實、反之、乙不注意建設、而注意於擴張軍備、即不注意於人民生產力之發達、竭盡人民所有於軍備、及人民生命泉源耗竭、其軍備的憑藉亦破碎、甲乙相遇勝負自分、以建設求統一、並未忘記充實武力的必要、武力是國家生存不可缺的條件、在弱肉强食的世界、兩强相遇還有公理可講、强弱相遇、公理丰乃一被輕衊的名詞、無强而談公理非惟無效、亦且可恥、故充實無力絕無異議、但勿忘武力泉源人民、無力量武力、即無充實之可能、現代武力乃由合理社會組織與科學、進步所造成、不但物質方面、有特於農工商業之發達、精神方面尤有待於道德紀商業之發達、精神方面尤有待於道德紀律之鍜鍊、此决非放棄建設而專事軍備擴張所能達到、如專事軍備擴張、則軍備越擴張、人民越困窮、少數飽肥將領、帶蛥數饑餓兵、再圍着大多數窮困人民、而與民力充實之軍隊相見、衆寡雖殊、其如人心離散何、民國以來、多數軍閥手擁重兵、一旦土崩瓦解、不能復起、其原因皆在於此、故欲求統一惟有建設、不能建設且不能自存、有何統一之可言、今日國事固可痛心然痛心不能統一尤當痛心不能建設民、國以來越求統一越致分裂、其最大原因、則在各無建設、如有建設、决不會民窮財盡、到此田地、如果一方有建設一方無之、則人民爲切身利害計、必出而擁護、有建設者、此可斷言故在對抗形勢之下其結果、不外三個方式、（一）彼此都不注意建設、而惟知以武力相角逐、其結果必兩敗俱傷、（二）一個注意建設、一個不注意建設其結果、建設者勝不建設者敗、（三）兩個都注意建設、彼此以建設爲競爭、此結果經濟關係日趨密切、分功合作、不能相離、彼此都自動的取銷對抗形勢、而要求統一、以上是以建設求統一的論據、也是我對國家前途之唯一希望、（十七日中央社電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>今日中國之人的問題梓</h3>
<p>本報月刋的「中國現代化問題號」中。有楊君端六論「中國現代化之先决决問題」一文。先説明「物質的設備。雖然是不可少的。但此外還有一個重要條件。就是要有人去用他。」結尾又慨然的説。「現在要想學德意俄。我們没有希特勒·墨索里尼·斯太林。要想學英美。我們又没有自由開化的民衆。這個困難問題。眞是不容易解决。」那兩段簡短的話。頗給與我們以不少的原題以外的啓發。</p>
<p>中國近來自國家的政治。以至社會的現狀。無不弄到不可收拾的地步若問何以糟糕至於如此。亦無非是人的問題。别國的事情。仗着人的心思力量。都能幹得像樣。中國的事情。則非但不能仗着人去辦好。翻被一班不堪的人。愈幹愈壞。數十年來。在各國一度行之有效的良法美制。差不多一一搬來過中國。結果是「橘踰淮而爲枳。」花樣縱使弄得新鮮好看。而在别國能利國福民的。在中國便不能發生一些好影響。往昔有人喜歡談國情。認爲這都是國情不同的緣故。無如事實很顯明的擺在我們眼前。中國的國情。很能迎合新潮流。决不致有拒絕别國的良法美制的事情。近來更有人用什麽社會特性。民族特性等等來解釋。其不可通。正與從前談國情的人們一樣老實説一句。缺乏「有人」的條件而已。</p>
<p>楊君原文的意思。以爲要使中國現代化。需要由上而下的政治影響。或由下而上的敎育影響。現在中國在政治上没有偉大的領袖。一般人民的敎育程度。又極幼稚。所以覺得困難。其實豈但中國現代化問題一切之一切的中國問題。都可以這意義來解釋。在去年一二八滬戰時。有人高談土耳其禦侮興國。無如有領袖資格的人。却絕對不願做凱末爾。至於中國的民衆。程度雖然不夠。觀於他們在國難中的掙扎。並非不能有爲。中國民衆的大缺點。正如麥唐納批評印度人的話。「他們變成服從的傢伙。而不是做事的公民。」變成服從的傢伙。便不能自由開化。那裏會有力量來抗拒得外侮。</p>
<p>人的問題。可以説是中國問題的根底。欲解决中國之人的問題。則必須先行使中國人民。得成爲自由開化的民衆。然後偉大的領袖。乃能在這自由開化的民衆中產生出來。</p>

<p>外務省連日會商結果</p>
<p>决定經濟外交三大綱</p>
<p>（東京）大角海相關於海軍第二次補充計劃發表如次意見、海軍軍備因日本爲島國、在國防上有非常重要之性質、余信國民亦能充分諒解此事、而海軍軍備以當時之國際情勢與列國海軍勢力及造艦狀况所支配、然自滿洲事變發生後、日本於過去及將來立於國際的頗困難之地位、一般國民亦有覺悟、一面列强海軍國努力進行其海軍力充實、日本旣然不能滿足倫敦海軍條約所規定之不充分的兵力量、故在該條約所許之範圍内充實軍備、無論何人均能肯認之、如此非常時期由國費之中抽出相當巨欵以爲海軍費、此亦不得已者也、如各國自制軍備之擴大、諒解日本公正主張、而國際環境傳好時、日本當然輕減海軍軍備、然現在無論何人、决不能推想、在最近將來、有如此便利情勢之出現、海軍省明年度之豫算中、第二次補充計劃爲不可避之重要計劃、現在國際情勢比第一次補充計劃當時更爲惡化、第二次補充之如何重要可以知之矣、（十七日日聯電）</p>

<h3>日軍閥推舉武藤實行軍人獨裁</h3>
<p>一氣解决增税與擴軍</p>
<p>（東京）自日政友會暫息内爭以來、在表面上日政局似甚穩固、其實在内部各派陰謀仍烈、今秋預算阁議之時、因增税問題與農村不安等、或有一番之大變動、各派之陰謀情形如左、（一）宇垣派與關西財閥及對華貿易家勾結、以政友會之反鈴木派及民政之富田伊澤系統之議員爲基本、欲謀下届政權、（二）久原派與民政黨計劃聯立内閣、（三）荒木派將擁護武藤關東軍司令官任首相、實行軍部獨裁政治、解决增税問題、擴張軍備、三大勢力皆虎視耽耽、今秋之日政界甚多事、（十七日華聯電）</p>

<p>詐外交、今日以情報部長名目、對記者團談云、日方所望者在通商振興通商、無需所謂通商條約、日政府不望簽訂條約云、（十七日華聯電）</p>
<h3>東路非法賣買</h3>
<p>僵局無法打開</p>
<p>俄日進行私的折衝</p>
<p>（東京）中東路讓渡交涉、勢成攔淺、外務省因兩國之主張相距太遠、即使進行正式討論、亦僅交換煩雜之議論、故若欲打開此局面、似應移向私的折衝之形式、準備公式討論較爲適當、是項意見兩國代表似無異議、謂於私的折衝之代表、蘇俄方面準備卡慈洛夫斯基、僞國方面準備專任大橋忠一、故今後之交涉、將專向私的折衝進行、又外務省方面任廣田前駐俄大使出而斡旋、（十七日電通電）</p>

<h3>世界經濟會議開幕經過（柏林通信）（續）公安</h3>
<p>（三）法意日德代表發表意見</p>
<p>倫敦世界經濟會議、在六月十二日是當作舉行大會開幕典禮的時期、十三日方是正式討論大會、是日開會、首由主席麥克唐納報告昨日大會開幕經過、和組織特種委員會事情、即（一）組織幣制委員會、（二）組織經濟委員會、旋即宣告法意日德各代表對大會發表意見程序、詞畢、法國代表Ｄａｌａｄｆｅｒ即登壇對大會發表第一次的議事意見、他的演詞很長、首述失業人數之增加、及其對於生產和商業减低的災難影響、他是不要探求經濟衰落的原因、跟着他立刻又指出農業的苦况、和戰後錯用的信用政策與幣制之破產、怎樣可以由這樣頽荒的經濟狀態造出一個新世界呢、他便提出下列四種主張、（一）首先必要把幣制戰爭和幣制的不定性掃除、正當維持金貨活動的自由决不可缺乏一日、價値的標準是由情面或偶然所支配、那末這樣欲求貨物暢流、和締結永久商約是不可能的、（二）生產家互相間必要成立互相監督的條約、以期生產量能對眞正需要的慾望而决定、而得一合理生產、此種條約首須在各工業國實行、特别對於重要生產門類如化學出產品等實行、然後求其普遍化以及於農業生產品、（三）即刻須要以最大努力改良勞働組織、實行每週四十小時勞働新制度、（四）施行公家勞働服役制度、其辦法依照最近國際勞働會的决議辦法進行、最後他特别請求、各國進行經濟戰爭的一切工作、須要大家同時放棄、各個民族須要無條件地决定志向、由自由和地方上的共同合作以謀恢復世界一般的信任、</p>
<p>意大利代表Ｊｕｎｇ發表的意見、比較法代表簡單、他首先特别鄭重地説、當我們没有談到提高國際物價水準和徵分關税的控制之前、首先就要向解决戰債問題着想、欲求世界經濟關係的改善、最要工作當在怎樣以謀世界幣制的安定、此外如意大利現在進行的經濟集團的連帶負責的組織制度、恰好爲世界各國所取例、深望大家留意云云、此外没有特殊見解、日本代表Ｔｏｄｉｔｉ是跟意代表作第三名的發言人、他的意見幾乎完全是站在日本本身的利益關係而發、他全没有顧到他是應該爲代表世界共同的整個經濟利益而發言、他説世界要維持自由貿易、各國門户開放、利益均佔、這樣的無聊話、差不多也是字字爲對中國而發、</p>
<p>德國代表Ｆｒｅｉｈｅｒｒ　ｖｏｎ　Ｎｅｕｒａｔｈ的發言、在比較上有幾點很特别的地方、德國代表説、今後世界國際上的債務、應以貨物或服務作償還代價、此種辦法、尤其是對德國目前經濟狀况爲挽救恐慌的唯一出路、本會議程上提列經濟與財政問題、兩者不能獨立解决、而必須並行同謀解放、依照他代表德國政府的意見、解决商業政策問題、必先解决信用和財政問題、世界人士大抵是公認、各國互相間的利害關係是極不一致的、他也絕不否認、但是他説、在事實上、一國的不安、即是世界的不安、工業不能維持、則農業也决不能偏安無事、要是國際上債務人不能生存、債權國决也不能生存、甚望各國代表放棄母國的偏面利益關係、妥謀世界的大衆和對方的福利、祗有恢復世界各民族的和平恊調的奮鬭、才能找得世界政治的出路、這一種見解、德國政府也認識得異常淸楚、此種主張、早已見諸德國内閣總理希特忒的對外宣言、最後他對於世界裁軍問題、也有連帶提及、略謂世界經濟大會得到完滿的結果、未始不是對裁軍問題建一良好磋商的基礎、</p>
<h3>（四）世界輿論對大會之屬望</h3>
<p>世界經濟會議開幕後、全世界輿論又集中其視綫於倫敦地質博物院中、一百六十八名、世界各國經濟巨子代表的言行、尤其是英美法德四國社會輿論、對於此次世界經濟會議的動作特别留心、因此便也使他們對大會有特别的屬望、當世界經濟會議未開會之前一天、英美法德四國全體報章、好像受了任何言論同盟總司令的命令、全體大小報章、皆有長篇大段的重林言論、對世界經濟會議而發表、一方面是披露他們迫切和重要的主張、貢獻大會、以求採納、或則提出種種有意識的忠告、以期大會的　悟、他方面是眞誠而懇切地寫出他們的恭維話、爲努力世界經濟合作的代表諸君作表彰、但各國輿論對經濟會議的態度殊不一致、關於此次世界經濟會議究竟將能獲得若何結果、法國對此問題、没有預言、守着沉默的靜候態度、德國大部份的聲調、都是肯定在戰債問題得不到根本解决之前、世界經濟合作事業是辦不到的、所以他們對大會是悲觀多而樂觀少、美國都是天天在白宫努力提倡世界大同、世界民主主義和民族恊助、他們是十分着重世界各國代表的共同工作、他們的理想、很相信以開會的方式可進於世界民主主義、所以他們對於此項倫敦會議總是表示樂觀、相信大會當有可期的結果、英國的態度、本來歷來對於世界大事都是守着看風把舵的所謂老成態度、但是倫敦泰晤士報對此次會議、老早已有一點悲觀的表示、大抵因時局多艱、以此而將激勵代表、而求大會善果、亦未可料、莫斯科深疑大會或有對蘇聯特殊經濟制度有不利的影響、他方因社會主義者認爲經濟恐慌是經濟制度本身的不健全問題、非徒謀合作可得挽救、故莫京的輿論除了譏笑資本主義的不能維持外、没有别的表示</p>
<h3>（五）結論與批評</h3>
<p>不錯、此次世界經濟會議有六十六國參加、二千代表人員與會、誠爲世界上自有人類歷史以來、見所未見的一件大事、後之作世界史者、對此次倫敦世界經濟會議、必占光榮史實之一頁、無用置疑、此會的意義與使命固然非常重大、且據大會主席麥氏報告、此會將有兩月長期的從長討論時間、其意即謂在此長期討論當中、必當造成善果、然而能得善果與否、亦即爲大會命運問題、記者之意以爲近代世界各國政治領袖、在謀解决世界或國際問問題、常以召集代表會議作出發、以期在長棹圓檯談笑之下解决困難、較諸戰前時代一味作盲目的武力鬥爭與威脅、而以聯盟訂約爲得意、以戰勝屈服爲榮幸者、日是略勝一　、論政治手叚、今則　　　　進步、而　　人類暫趨和平恊調之初階、就此觀點而言、我們對於此次世界經濟會議値得爲之致頌與推崇、但在他方一審國際目前大勢、民族的國家主義、正在昨極端的非常發展、自足·自立·自救·自護·自主·自强·自助·自覺·自守·自勵·和自動·的新聲浪、澎湃一時、風靡歐陸、而與國際恊調·合作·扶</p>
<p>持和共濟的呐喊成一平行趨勢、爲了這種世界政治思潮矛盾的反響、所以國際聯會、雖有亦等於無、與議而不行之裁軍會議、雖經各國代表舌爛唇焦與力强聲嘶的討論、結果是徒勞無益、空勞各代表之舟車跋涉、今之世界經濟會議、豈獨能脱出此種人類矛盾思想支配的可能、有議之士自當知其爲不可能、况且目前世界經濟恐慌現象、確係由於資本主義經濟組織本身不善的崩壞問題、所以在資本主義的經濟制度没有根本改造之前、生產過剩、失業發生、幣制戰爭、商業戰爭、關税戰爭、爲必然之現象、非恊調可得解救、且似亦無恊調之可能、請以中國爲例、以中國處於當前世界資本主義社會的連環中之一圈子、在没有放棄資本主義的經濟創度之前、祗有積極在國際對立上促進中國國家資本主義之發展、免得退居人後、致受大資本國富力的威脅、致使自己處於不利的被壓迫地位、可是處於中國當前的經濟組織情形之下、怎樣才可以發展和極度推進中國國家資本主義的發達呢、我認爲除了提高關税、以積極的和强硬的提高關税、和積極的奬勵商戰之外、没有他路可行、提高關税、即可以拒絕外貨入口、振興國内工業的發展奬勵商戰、即可發展海外貿易、以求中國能得出超地位庶使中國國富不致日减月削的窮化、（據近年中國出入口貨統計、中國近年入超四萬萬元以上、如是必使中國窮化、甚屬明顯）、所以爲中國計、我們决不能和萬不能放棄提高關税和商戰政策、反之資本主義工業發達的國家、是極端希希中國撤消關税、如是可讓他們大量的過量生產品充斥於中國市塲、可以自由盡量地吸收我國金錢、從而可使中國快入經濟破產的地獄、就此立論、中國對於大會的關税休戰、不獨不能謀妥恊、實則爲我中國自身前途計、即當提出反對、深望中國代表諸公、於此當加最大注意、印度墨西哥和土耳其等新興國家情形、與中國有同樣要求、至於德國現在正是進行積極有力的經濟自足運動、甚至連錫蘭的牛油、都禁絕不准入口、在德國而想抽一枝英國出產的香烟、即以萬金亦買不來、可知其關税防標英貨如何嚴密、這樣能求國際的經濟妥恊、豈非夢話而何、老實説、除非世界達到大同統一時代、無國界人種之别的時候、則關税如中國之厘金始可出於自然合理的廢除、否則、都是必要的繼續延長下去、此外關於幣制問題、依世界經濟學泰斗卡塞爾的意見、除非全世界成立一種統一的平等新幣制外、則不能免世界金融上的混亂、但是世界没有統一以前、如何能造得一種世界統一的幣制呢、這又豈不是夢想、總之、照事實説來、此次世界經濟會議、不能如理想結果之容易達到、理至明顯、</p>
<h3>日急築吉會路企圖控制東亞</h3>
<p>東京朝日新聞載特派員今井義一電稱、吉會全線之開通、在今日已認爲亟不容緩之圖、因敦圖北迥線與鮮鐵圖們東迥線連絡、使滿洲内地與日本海交通便捷、實爲歷史上特筆可記之大事件、換言之、吉會線之開通、日本今後在軍事上政治上經濟上之價値、均甚重大故也、蓋吾國自滿洲事變勃發以來、對於滿洲敷設鐵道、本爲極緊急之事件、按哈爾濱與齊齊哈爾聯絡之海克線、哈爾濱與拉發連絡之拉賓線、以及由敦化經局子街至圖們、渡國際　橋聯結鮮鐵圖們東迥線、與日本均0有　切關係、特其中敦　北迥線、尤負重大使命、目下滿鐵已投下四千萬元巨資、急速建設、指定線路終點之羅津港、爲日滿海陸最短之大動脈、今敦圖北迥線、已於四月二十日完成、敦圖南迥</p>
<p>線、年内亦可完成、此幹線完成、其經濟的建設之主要者、爲北滿之寳庫、如大豆與其他特產物、均可盡量運出、即與南滿鐵道成爲兩大動脈、一旦羅津港建築竣事、以長春爲中心而至大阪、經過羅津港、自比由南滿路經過大連、可縮短六百六十二基羅米突、又比經過釜山、縮短五百八十基羅米突、回憶明治三十二年、英艦十二艘曾入該港、日俄大戰時、上村艦隊追擊巴爾的克艦隊時、亦在此港待機、苟建築完成、在經濟上北鮮集散之千萬噸貨物、除在雄基淸津二港約百萬噸外、悉可吸收於此、他日吉會全線開通、朝鮮滿蒙與日本内地聯絡完成、則日本控制鮮滿、防禦外敵、亦可安然無慮云云、</p>
<h3>日因侵滿已成令全軍一齊休養</h3>
<p>九日名古屋新聞載稱、滿洲事變勃發以來、迄今已届一年十個月、在此期内、日本軍在滿洲各地、待戰未停、並將熱河長城方面平定、足以維持「滿洲國」内之治安、掃除一切的障碍、因此日本軍行動之目的、可謂已完全達到、陸軍當局、預料今後可以維持現狀、不至再有意外事態發生、如至高果繁茂時期、再無擾亂情事、决以本年十月爲限、解除戰時狀態、並以明年二三月爲期、令全軍一齊休養、現陸軍省參謀本部與全國陸軍關係官廳、規定自七月一日起、撤消戰時俸給、凡在滿各部隊之結養、以及其他法規所定、自明年三月起、取消戰時狀態時之支出、蓋將士之餉銀、在戰時增加至十分之五以上、而在平時滿洲之駐屯軍餉銀、可减少至十分之四、如此全體軍費、亦可節省不少云、</p>

<p>日本左傾運動激劇（日本通信）</p>
<h3>從學生赤化到軍隊赤化</h3>
<p>日本左傾學生的數目、已經被司法當局所拘捕而起訴的、從一九二八年到現在、有丁二千四百九十九名、還有七百六十一人是暫時保留着起訴的自一九二八年以來、一年比一年數目加多、如果把没有被政治當局發覺的左傾學生都算進去、其確數固不易統計、但至少在一萬人以上、司法當局旣嚴重彈壓於旣經出事之後、敎育部和内務部又有專門取締思想惡化的機關、然而收效極微、好像牠越是取締、越是壓迫、而左傾的反動却越見厲害、</p>
<p>左傾思想所以在學生界中會這樣激劇的原故、并没有什麽神秘的根由、揭穿來説、就是經濟恐慌的襲來、日本在表面上雖保持着相當的好市面、但是實際上、一般社會情勢、從農村生活以至於都市生活、都逐漸惡化、縱令極力用軍需工業去刺激牠、而結果僅可以維持着皮面的、除極少數人的安定外、最大多數的勤苦大衆、總是每况愈下、所以各階級層的思想都發生動搖、往右走極端的是利用歷史的惰性來刺激羣衆、使他們回想往昔、使他們都擴大向外發展的野蠻心理、而從事於積極的侵略、在左極端方面是不滿於現社會的種種、想要積極從事於改革、這樣的改革非但與日本現在的統治衝突、并且對於資本主義制也持根本的否定態度、持這樣態度的人、豈但是勞苦的人爲然、即中等人家的子女也意識着這一點、因爲日本的失業恐慌、在知識界爲尤甚、大學生畢了業找不到職業、甚或現有職業的也被解僱、同時他們的家庭狀况也是日趨於崩潰、天天向着破產的路上狂奔、他們自己無時無刻不感受生活困難的恐慌、於是右傾的思想從軍事侵略當中找尋出路、左傾的則以憧憬社會主義制度爲前題、各走極端、而不可制止、</p>
<p>日本的軍事當局和政治當局、正極力扶助右傾思想的實際行動、和一切右傾的團體、用以促進牠的侵略政策、對左傾的人及左傾團體、則加以最大的壓力、使牠漸歸消滅、近今日政府的政策竟要一網打盡左傾思想、殊不知牠竟和雨後春笋一樣、發生得很快而且多、剛剛破壞了牠、又會很快的生起來、例如京都事件在去年九月發生、現在才完全爲社會所共知的事件、祇一部分的地方組織、被捕的就有四百零一人、其中京都帝大的學生有六十人、其他各校約計共有五十人、在這些人當中、很有幾個所謂上流階級出身的子女、如大阪市長關一博士的次子、如京都選出的議員川橋豐治郎的長子、都爲左傾團體効奔走、他們對於工人運動用過不少的力量、如京都市電氣公司的工人運動、他們又在鐘淵紡織等大工廠組織得有突擊隊、隨時練習準備與對方作實際的爭鬥、他們對大丸、對高島屋等大商店、同有具體的赤化計劃、對附近農村中的農民也施行着赤化的敎育、而且在民衆運動以外、還有赤化軍隊的企圖、京都第十六師團管下各聯隊中的壁上、到處都有了「反對戰爭」「反對侵略」等等標語、同時在步兵第九聯隊·第三十三聯隊·第三十八聯隊·中都暗地裏發生赤色組織、當局爲了保持軍譽起見、現時嚴禁發表關於軍隊赤化的記載、在海軍方面、舞鶴海軍工作部固然早就滲進了赤色分子、使海軍要港也根本上發生了腐蝕作用、</p>
<p>這回的運動就思想方面、就敎育關係方面、已經足以令日本政治當局十分狼狽、因爲京大的學生、成羣的加入左傾的活動、使日本靑年感受莫大刺激、發生極不好的影響、而軍隊當中有了這樣「惡化」傳染進去、發生腐蝕作用、日本軍閥的「武器」、漸次要轉變成爲反對方面的武器了、（七月十二日於東京）</p>

<p>按上計劃、約四年之後、即可實施治導之工作、其工作項目如下、（甲）刷淸下游河漕、換言之、即對於下游河道橫切面加以整理、河口加以疏濬、河水含沙過多、爲黃河之一大問題、欲求河漕不淤墊、則流速與切面必有合理之規定、如是則河漕刷深、水由地中行矣、其法或用束堤、或用丁壩、因地制宜、（乙）修正河道路綫、河道過曲、爲下游病症之一、故應裁直之處甚多、惟同時亦應顧及現有之事實、相勢估計、規定之後、於何處應裁直、何處宜改弧、亦當次第興辦也、（丙）設置滾水壩、於内堤之適當地點、設滾水壩、俾洪水暴漲時、可以漫流而過、流入内隄外隄之間、旣可免冲决之患、且可淤高兩隄間之地、以固地形、惟必加以測騐、審愼處置、以免河水因疏而分、因分而弱、因弱而淤河床、（丁）設置谷坊、山谷間之設坊橫堵、旣可節洪流、且可澱淤沙、平邱壑、應相度本支各流地形、以小者指導人民設置之、大者官力爲之、（戊）發展水力、沿河可發展水利之地甚多、宜利用之、而以測量河口爲第一事、（己）開闢航運、黃河上下游必整理之、俾便航行、凡比降過大、或礁石障阻之處、可設閘以升降之、或開除其障碍、（庚）减除泥沙、於泥沙入河之後、應使之携澱於海、然爲治本淸源計、以能减少其來源爲上、其法爲嚴防兩岸之冲塌、及另選避沙新道、再則爲培植森林、平治階田、開抉溝洫、（辛）防禦潰决、於各項新工程實施之後、則水由地中行、水患自可逐漸减除、惟仍宜竭力防護之、</p>
<h3>墾地步驟</h3>
<p>墾地工作、一則有利河道、再則增加生產、實屬有益、茲分述墾地之步驟如下、（甲）恢復溝洫、治水之法、有設谷閘以節水者、然水庫善淤、若分散之爲溝洫、則不啻億千小水車、可以容水、可以留淤、淤經滯取、可以糞田、利農兼以利水、惟西北階田、必須以政府之力、督令人民平治整齊、再加溝洫、方爲有效、（乙）整理河口三角洲、河口三角洲淤田三百萬畝、且河道遷移不定、水難暢行、棄富源於地、亦殊或惜、應即着手治理、則工程農田、兩收其利、（丙）整理河灘荒地、沿河兩岸荒地甚多、或由於河道之變遷、或由於兩岸之淤高、多爲未墾之地、如豫省之沿河兩岸、及陝西韓郃·朝華·一帶是、（丁）鹼地放淤、沿河鹼地、多爲不毛、每畝價格極低、即以山東而論、已有近萬頃之數、其他若河南河北兩省沿岸亦甚夥、若能整理得法、則荒田變佳壤、其利甚溥、（戊）河套墾地、河套一帶未墾之地尙多、宜墾植之、（己）灌漑田畝、黃河上游及各支流、宜施行灌漑工作、况</p>
<p>上游雨量缺乏、尤宜行之、惟在下游、頗有考慮之必要、蓋以鞏縣以下、支流無幾、若引多量之水以資漑田、則所取者多爲水面及河邊之水、而含沙量必較少、因之河水之含沙量之百分數必增加、是故下段灌漑、應於河道切面設計時加以考慮也、（日日社）</p>

<p>春秋東西人士目光中的蓮花  瞻廬　　陽光四射其赤線兮，蓮憚與之見也：首垂垂其作夢想兮，冀素月之露面也。　　蓮之膩友日月神兮，乍一吻而醒其夢魂也；態盈盈而下拜淸輝兮，夫何容光之動人也？我在蓮花池旁迻譯海　的愛蓮詩，時有習習香風指到我的箋紙之上。東方人詠蓮，和西方人不同；東方人説荷花是媚日的，所以有一句　映日荷花别樣紅」。西方人説蓮花畏日而親月，受月一吻，蓮便淸醒，月是蓮的懋人。詩人的思想，本來無可無不可的，説它親日也好，説它親月也好、好在它是任人支配的，無論如何，它總不會答辯一句。　　東方人對於蓮的觀念，也和西方人稍有差異；東方人把蓮花當做君子，自從周濂溪這麽一提倡，蓮花便博得君子的頭銜；而且，世襲罔替，從北宋傳到今日，什麽封建制度都已打倒，惟替，從北宋傳到今日，什麽封建制度都已打倒，惟有蓮花的君子封號，比着鐵券河山還得堅固，誰都承認它是花中的君子。　　西方人雖也重視蓮花，但，把它代表一種已經贖了罪而能自新的人。人能立志自新，便在世界潮流洶湧之中，也會泰然不爲所動；宛比蓮花透過一片汪洋的水而昂然在水面抬頭。　　寫到這　，我便停筆問池蓮：「你是東方人所説的君子呢？還是西方人説的悔過自新之人？」這時候，微風乍止，蓮花不搖頭也不點頭。小學敎育  廬子　　「冬烘先生」，雄踞「三家村」，開張「子曰店」，滿門「拖鼻涕」，自命爲「得天下英才而敎育之」。　　自「論」令「廢科舉，興學堂」之後，「冷板橙」搖搖欲墜，幸而「三家村」大有「桃花源」氣槪，「不知有民國，無論三民主義」，所以吃飽了墨水，游不進泮水的老冬烘，兀是領着一羣高足，大讀其「孟子見梁惠王。」　　但國民政府成立之後，曾雷厲風行地取締私塾過。其結果，除了「冷板橙」當災之外，是否增進了「敎育效能」，就很難答復。　　説起了「增進敎育效能」，不用客氣，自然該讓「奮發有爲」的「小學敎員」們負起這個天大的責任。但是要「小學敎員」奮發有爲而「增進敎育效能」，自然先該給他們裝飽了肚子。　　現在的「小學敎員」們，委實也太可憐了。花了念書本錢，領了中學文憑，再要花上一筆「運動費」該説「請託費」，才謀到了「三家村」裏甚麽廟小學校校長的位置。　　校長到手了，月薪十三四元的，已算很闊的了。每年十個月算，而校中經費，不欠三月個以上，已算大幸。這樣的多則一年，少則半載，敎育局長走了，「要走大家走」。就是不走，新局長一到，「不走也要你走。」　　「冬烘先生」高坐「子曰店」，一年三節，「自奉束修以上」，一樂也。逢年過節，在學生家中，「有酒食，先生饌」，二樂也。若是兒子「克紹箕裘」，儘可「繼承父業（作產業解）」，三樂也。　　繼「冬烘行狂」而擔起「小學敎育」大任者的「小學敎員」，「進賬」還夠不上「冬烘」，而且又没人尊敬，至於「飯盌」的穩固問題更是説不上。在這情形之下，而還望「增進敎育效能」，眞是「旣要馬兒不吃草，又要馬兒跑得好」，活見鬼。　　在下曾當過半年「敎書匠」，現在跳出了「火坑」，但是想起了「小學敎育」的那副嘴臉，雖在六月炎天，也會「汗毛直豎」。夏晚散記  寗一　　晚上，夏天的晚上，路上不像平時幽靜，樹蔭下坐滿了人，穿汗衫短褲的男人，裸着胸喂乳給孩子吃的女人盡皆很安閒地坐在竹椅上談笑，有時會有女子的駡聲夾雜在内胡琴聲往往也會在人推裏透出，隨着是「頭七到來哭哀哀」的歌聲。　　飲冰室裏從玻璃窗内透出幽綠的光，電扇在上面很迅速地旋轉，穿白制服的Ｂｏｙ鼻尖貼近玻窗向外望着，裏面的氣候確和外面不同，行路的人們額上堆着汗珠時也許會説幸福的孩子呀？　　汽車似乎較平時多了，它時常會不絕地在乘凉者的眼前閃過；而引起他們煩惱，和威到情形的喧閙，雖然也許這是心理作用，但，下了篷的汽車，裝了穿紗的女人，穿綢長衫的男人，確是平日所没有的。　　在没有樹而舖着石子的路，路是這樣的低高不平而又是狹窄，但，人們仍是在路旁乘凉，因着經不起鴿籠式房子裏熟的蒸薫，於是一條狹板擱在街沿上是最妙的尋黑甜鄉去處，可是黃包車經過，車夫總得不停地喊着，「　　　脚伸進」同時頭左右回顧，惟恐碰了人　　晚上，夏天的晚上就是這樣的雜亂。電車上  張一蘋　　霓紅燈光下吐出一羣人，是電影散塲的時候。一輛電車剛從東邊駛來，下車的人被上車的堵住，　票不敢隨意的駡猪；他見那一羣高貴紳土和太太丨混亂，騷動，電車終在綠光中向西駛去。　　頭髮上過電刑，本來面目被脂粉掩遮了的一位姑娘，伊擠，從月臺上擠進車廂。伊眼角從每個坐着的人面上飄過，一位紳士掉了靈魂似的站起身來，伊微笑，替上那空的座位。绅士吊在籐圈上，身子微微擺動，電車是開得那樣快，不時有樸上伊身去的危險。姑娘並不注意到這點，伊對着手提篋中的鏡子，用粉紙敷去滲出來的汗珠，伊忽然發覺紳士餓眼似的瞧着伊，伊可以從小鏡子瞧見他上半個腦袋。　　電車在另一個站停住，紳士很敏捷的在伊身旁補了缺，他不必故意，已擠得很緊。姑娘却是有意送過媚笑，他整了整領帶，像大情人希佛萊一樣，嘴脣上俏皮地吹着「夢裏情人」。　　他們已很熟識，除了没有交談；各人的面上都露着神秘的微笑。　　電車在另一個站停住，女的步着華爾茲，向月臺走去，男的也吸引了似的站起身來。賣票的眼快，從紳士手中接過車票，他知道車票上的價目還没有到站。忍飢  亦菴　　人類忍飢的能力若同許多生物比較起來，則眞是不足道。人類可以不飲不食而生存至十天或十二天，有水飲則可以生存至幾個星期，這是眞的，不過有許多動物要比人類强得多。德國的一位赫柯夫博士舉出幾種生物的忍飢能力説：普通的歌鳥能忍飢至兩日。松鼠之類則不能越過四日。但是刺蝟的冬蟄期能忍飢至三個月至四個月就可驚。肉食鳥類往往因爲不容易得食，能忍飢至兩個星期以上。有一穩沙門魚因爲要在淸水域内產卵，爲期要九個月，而在這九個月内它們並不吃什麽東西。還有可驚的紀錄，就是尙有許多爬行動物能忍飢至一年，却仍能安然出來。人類因爲文化的進步，内臟的　造也進步，不過堅强的能力也同時退化了。東北四連長  張恨水　　第十一回　俯首許婚姻芳情脈脈　關心𦤾士卒喜氣洋洋　　趙自強微笑著點了道：那一定，我路上沒有人，我也可以託我們親戚，和你找一個相當的人。我們親戚家那老太太，十分的好，而且又熱心，遇到這些事，一定可以幫忙。一個人只要是吃過苦來的，總會做好人。趙自強說到這裏，他對他的新岳母，不免誇張一陣。然而王士立卻是茫然，他的什麼親戚，親戚什麼樣一個老太太；這完全不知道。而且與趙連長共事多時，也從來不曾聽到說他有什麼親戚，現在忽然大事誇張起來，這倒不解何以半夜裏會殺出一個李逵來。趙自強看他有些猶豫的樣子，這才想了起來，自己並未言明快要訂婚，人家知道什麼親戚。再說，這婚事也不算就成功，怎麼好對人說楊家就是自己的親戚呢？這就向著人有些難爲情了。於是向王士立道，我今天太高興了，所以說了許多高興的話。過些時候，也許你就明白了。王士立道：是的，補充來的那些弟兄，這幾天總算教導得有些上軌道了。將來比較起來，也許是咱們的成績最好。趙自強聽他如此說著，倒哈哈一陣笑了。他不但是聽了說那蠢豬上般的新兵，他會高起興來，就是到了講堂上去講功課的時候，看到他那新的弟兄，舊的弟兄，　都一視同仁，並不煩惱。在嚴厲之中，對弟兄放出仁慈的樣子來，以爲他們了窮來當兵，根本缺乏知識，怎能怪他呢？到了下午四點鐘，伙夫和麵的蒸禮窩頭，雖然是熱氣騰騰，那熱氣裏可帶著霉味。另一桶子，便是熬白菜。提到白菜，不是粗糙的食品，南方將北京的白菜燒肉吃，還是時髦菜呢。（一三三）婦女樂園母親須知  珮瑜　　衛生的衣服　　誰也承認衣服和健康，有密切的關係；兒童的衣服，和健康更有密切的關係。凡是做一件衣服，至少要合下列的四個條件：第一是價廉，第二是適當，第三是衛生，第四是舒服。緊的衣服，足以妨碍身體的行動和惹起壓力的，不能當作合于衛生，有益健康的衣服。我們的身體，需要空氣的流通，所以頸部寛展，不裝領頭的寛衣服，對於自由通氣，最爲相宜；因爲身體上的熱氣，是向上升的，蒸發氣也隨之而升，新鮮的空氣從下面上來補充。假使頸部裏緊，空氣便不易流通，成人尙可，兒童太不適宜。質料太厚而没有細孔的衣服，阻礙四肢也不相宜。兒童的衣服最易受汚，應該常換常洗，因此做兒童的衣服，應選耐洗，質鬆，料薄的質料才是。至於兒童的腰帶或褲帶，不宜結得太緊，有些兒童的褲子是用吊帶的，對於年紀較大的兒童，很是相宜，不過年紀幼小的兒童，不宜用此；因爲吊在兩肩上，足以使兩肩有下傾之勢，並阻脊柱的挺直。　　嬰孩的淸潔　　欲使嬰孩健康，需要十二分的當心。有許多很細微的事，對於嬰孩，却有極大的影響。假使忽略了嘴便易患鵝口瘡；忽略了耳，便易變　；忽略了眼，便易成盲，忽略了指甲，便易伸入口内而患慢性的喉腫。因此洗嬰孩的嘴，應用少許硼砂和水。嬰孩每次吃乳之後，應該把這液體來洗口一次，以免口内　餘的乳變酸，到了胃襄，再加了第二次吃下的乳，就要釀腸疝痛和别的毛病。所以在哺乳的時候，手邊應該預備好一杯温水和一撮的硼砂，待嬰孩食畢，把一小塊棉花，在這液體内浸濕後，洗滌嬰孩的口腔，第二樣應當注意之點是洗嬰孩的耳，和使耳乾，耳内切不可塗肥皂，祇有耳外可以在洗浴時洗的，不過也要等到洗完身體的其他各部，才可洗耳。洗耳應用一小塊浸濕硼砂液的棉花，向耳内徐徐塞入，徐徐取出，然後再把一小塊乾棉花，行同樣的手續。假使發見了一種發疹或濕疹微候，應該先試以少許硼砂軟膏。若是不再見效，可以養化鋅軟膏試之，但是棉花或其他的塞物，升萬不可留在嬰孩的耳内。有許多嬰孩患眼臉腫，腫的緣故是睡在日光之下。有些母親以爲嬰孩睡在日光之下數小時，很有利益的，其實使嬰孩的眼與頭受到傷害。嬰孩睡在日光下，需要十二分的保護。當你發見嬰孩的眼睛有些發炎，或眼臉有些紅腫的時候，一早一晚用微温硼砂液來洗嬰孩的眼部。最簡單的方法，是用一塊海綿，浸吸了這種液體，輕輕地在他的腫處榨些液汁下來，但不可把海綿觸着腫處。這樣行了兩三次，那麽讓它慢慢地乾。嬰孩的指甲不能怱略的。應該常備一把小而尖鋭的剪刀，剪起來要從左端一直向右端剪去，或從右端一直向左端剪去。敎嬰孩自己剪指甲，第一次是很難的，過了幾時，便易學會。短訉名伶程硯秋，此次公演，雖未登臺，所有三晚之戲票，早已售罄。茲聞程氏爲優待學生工友及一般民衆起見，定於每星期日加演日戲一次，戲價定八角六角四角三角共四級，所有各項小費等，一律在内，另外不取分文。演劇時間規定下午三時起六時止，仍以三小時爲限，力圖便利觀衆，亦可見程氏努力改進之一斑矣。  達自北平寄</p>

<p>自由談偶想  鳳吾　　這個年頭，智識份子是苦悶的。如最近出版的「文學」等等，它們的取材無論是如何的雜，形式無論是如何的不同，但大部分的文字是有着共通點的，卽是：對於現實的憤怒。　　「對於現實的憤怒，」在黑暗的生活苦難時代，是必然的。而現在，是連僅僅一點的憤怒，作家們也必須委婉曲折的達出，讀者也祇能隱隱約約地看到，這眞是所謂刻骨的苦惱。如果説，文化史上的ＤａｒｋＡｇｅ，並没有消蝕在這號稱「文明」的現代的世界，那麽，這樣的黑暗，不惟因着光明的成長而在繼續，且是比過去更爲發展了。　　「我們是在一個血腥的時代呢！抬起頭來，我們只看見冷森森的槍刺；低下頭去，我們又只看見遍佈大地的十字架和鎖鏈。「文化」，「智慧」，「人類的前途」，是在那裏？它們是在刺刀尖上宛轉呻吟着啊！」（見「文學」「社評」：「槍刺尖上的文化」）　　「在刺刀尖上宛轉呻吟，」這是鐵一般的事實。不過，這樣的事實，並不足以引爲深憂。「可蘭經」與「劍刀」雖自有其威力，但摧毁在血肉中進展着的文化，究竟還不可能。這是從歷史的過程上，獲得了充分的證明的。　　新的文化，有如新鮮的空氣。「劍刀」的力量决不能把一個人封鎖在沉濁的氣氛裏，除掉一些活的死人。同樣的，文化有如瀉地的水銀，在任何的空間裏，在任何腐爛的所在，它都會一一的侵入的。流血與恐怖，對於文化的進展，雖然有不少的防碍，更有力的，却證明了舊的力量已經到了最後的一步。　　可怖的又是多麽可愛的時代啊，尖鋭的衝突，血肉的苦鬥，遍地都是可歌可泣的詩材，無往而非苦悶惱怒的空氣；智識分子是苦悶的，但是，新的文化的路，是在這上面建立了。　　「文化是活的，人性的，人類一定會向摧殘文化的槍刺提出嚴重的抗議，這抗議當然不是口頭的，紙上的，而是事實的」（見「文學」：「槍刺尖上的文化」）。「我的預言，是將來會有若干作者皆相信除了告靑年人「自衛」且指示出自衛方法以外，别無再好的話可説」（見沈從文：「丁玲女士失踪」）。斧鉞當前，但這裏並没有一點兒的顫慄；舊的壓迫，結果是促成了新的生長罷了。文化的路是「斬」不斷的啊！七月十四  沈起予　七月十四，這是一七八九年法國布爾喬亞慘淡辛苦的大革命紀念日。這紀念日不特每年熱閙了法國内地，而且喧騰了殖民地的上海法國租界。　　因之今年的七月十四，那一長條的霞飛路上，也照樣飾上了燦爛的電燈和繽紛的旗幟，擁擠得人山人海，法國公園的進口雖然有人在叱咤着，呌人們把衣服扣好，然而爲着不收門票之故，依然有無數披着汗衫的人們，發瘋地往裏面闖。紥着彩燈的各個巡捕房前，老是有那多黃皮刮瘦的臉層層站着，死也不肯走開，他們彷彿忘去打死理髮匠的一件事了。然而，我們却也不能怪他。事實上，廣大的民衆是無邪氣的：他們常常喜歡集合於野外，集合於天空之下，他們是喜歡民衆的節慶（Ｆｅｔｅｓ　ｄｕ　ｐｅｕｐｌｅ）的。因之羅曼羅蘭説：「幸福而自由的民衆，節慶比演劇更爲需要；民衆自身，即常是自己最美麗的視景，所以我們要爲民衆準備民衆節。」從前的盧梭及迭德羅一流的哲人，也常有這樣的意見。　　可是現在沉悶到極點了的中國民衆，一年中究何時有過自己的民衆節呢？從前的雙十節，大家還做做提燈會，而今則每每在「嚴密的防範」下面，連過路都怕遭了「不白之寃」，用何談及娛樂！盧梭談及演劇時，説：關閉着極少數的人在一個黑暗的洞空中，使他們感覺死沉而不靈活的這種演劇，是不當採用的。演劇尙不宜出乎此，然而應當是公開的民衆慶祝，現在竟也僅派派代表，關閉到一個黑暗的洞中去舉行了！　　明乎此，則我們又何怪那些沉悶到了極點的民衆要到霞飛路上去閙熱一下呢！介紹「無名文藝」中的兩篇創作  秀俠　　「無名文藝」月刋出版已經一個月了。但也許眞的因爲「無名」的原故，不能引起讀者的注意，外面没有一點什麽批評。反之，這幾天新出版的「文學」，三五天便是「再版」，這眞是没奈何的事。　　本來，在我國新文壇的僅僅十數年的歷史中，「有名」與「無名」，也不過是五十步之與百步而已。所謂有名作家者，不過經騐較多，從事較早，以言「成功」，還是談之過早。而以這幾許有名作家而論，能夠努力前進，再接再厲的，又是很少（矛盾先生算是最努力的一個。）好像眞的表現出衰老的民族精神似的，不多幾時，也就疲乏地，乾枯地落伍了。這原因自然是由於時代的洶汰，與作家生活方式的决定。我們已經知這「哥哥妹妹」的創作并不需要，但成名作家的能夠深入大衆裡開展他的新生活的又能有幾人？惟其如此，我們對於發動靑年作家，擴大文壇的陣線，是急切需要的事。　　事實上證明，無名作家中有不少優秀的作品出現，他的活潑果敢的勇氣與努力的精神，是使人激勵的，卽如這無名的一夥所自費出版的「無名文藝」月刋也是一件明證。　　「無名文藝」中所使人値得注意的兩篇創作，是葉紫的「豐收」與島西的「垃圾」。這兩個生疏作者的名字，以前我們没有看見過，但他們作品所表現的修養與意識，不比所謂成名作家的成熟作品爲　。　　「豐收」的題材，是緊緊抓着去年豐收成災的事實，而描寫農村的破落。地主豪紳的壓迫剝削，農民的種種呻吟與痛苦。雲普叔一家的悲慘命運，何八爺的高利貸盤剝，以至立秋的醒覺，都是中國整個農村情形和農民心理的縮影。作者用樸實的手法，一點不誇張地寫出來，比之矛盾先生在申報月刋上用差不多的題材所寫的一篇「秋收」，實在并不遜色。　　「垃圾」一篇没有「豐收」這篇好，但新鮮的題旨，活潑舍蓄的手腕，無疑地是一篇有生氣的作品，内容用患眼病的排長反映出兵士生活和中層階級的諸面相，作風有點像柴霍甫，但比柴霍甫更顯得發展些，朗爽些。　　總之，這兩篇創作是値得一介紹的，這兩位作者，雖然算不了什麽天才，但是很有希望的。　　不要從偶像的崇拜下埋没了抬起頭來的有希望的無名作者，反之，我們需要發動靑年羣衆，培養新進隊伍，以鞏固文壇上前進勢力的戰鬥力與陣營。血衣  侍桁　　在悶熱的暑夏的深夜裏，起了暴風雨；我伏在桌上，手裏的筆飛動着，同時不斷地用毛巾拭着面上的汗。　　有人在敲着我的屋門了；我不經意地呌了一聲請進來。停住律轉過身來一看，在屋門口站着一個陌生的靑年男子。　　「你是Ｈ先生麽？」他先對我問了。　　「是的；有什麽事麽？」我説着站起身來迎出去。　　「Ｌ小姐吩咐我來的；要你給她送一件新衣服去。」　　「你不可以代我拿去麽？」我聽見Ｌ小姐這個名字已經怕了，她是我的良心上的一條黑影。　　「不；她要你親自送去！」那個陌生的靑年説。　　「現在她在那裏？丨丨外面落着這麽大的雨！」　　「不要問了，就隨着我來吧；冒着暴雨，在你的心靈上能刻下更深刻的印記。」那個靑年好像很得意他的話語的含意。　　我服從了，因爲在這雨夜間突然出現的靑年，對於我彷彿是象徵着一種精力，或者根本就是神的扮裝也未可知。我從衣箱裏取出一件純白色的衣服，隨在那個靑年的身後走出房屋來。　　走到暴雨狂舞的暗夜的街上，整個的身體像是一個水鷄了；但是我並不懼怕，我的心是非常寗靜而且虔誠的。自己旣然犯下了神忌的罪過，就應該用生命來贖償的，我是從來不想躱避那不可避免的事。　　那個領路的靑年，始終沈默着，像是有意保持着他的威嚴。最後他領我走進一間屋裏去，像是病室，發着血腥的氣味。在薄暗的燈光下，我好像看見床上臥着一個婦人，丨將從死裏掙扎出來的可憐的婦人。我没有勇氣抬起我的頭來看她，跪在床邊，雙手舉起那件純白色的衣服送過去。　　她接受了。於是我想我可以馬上逃開了吧。但是那個領我來的靑年又在發話了：　　「你還不能就走，請你把這團汚濁的衣服也拿了去!這也是她預先吩咐我的。」　　爲了那臥在床上的婦人，我只得把那血腥的一團衣服接過來，我很淸楚在那件衣服裏還藏着什麽東西。　　我又逃到暴雨的街上了，在我的耳邊好像隱隱地嚮着那個靑年的嘩笑聲，以及那個和死掙扎着的婦人的呻吟聲。　　再走回自己的屋來，暴雨停住了，窗外彷彿已經現出了薄明的曙光。　　我怎麽也不敢打開那團血衣來看的，急忙把它抛在陰暗的墻角裏，但是不曉得從什麽時候，我的雙手已經浸上鮮紅的血了。　　在人類還没有蘇醒之前，我把那團血衣悄悄地埋在一個最隱秘的地方，除去我再没有第二個人類會知道在那裏曾埋過仠麽，從此不露絲毫的痕跡了。可是我手上的血，不知曾經冲洗過多少次。那血記却總是鮮明的，我每看見了我手上的血，便想起了那久已埋在地下的血衣，同時悔恨和懊惱嚙噬着我的心。創作小説平凡的事（十五）  澹果孫　　「他們」，好幾個代表説，「他們都是吃了東洋鬼的槍子才回來的」！　　「他們究竟爲着甚麽吃了槍子呢」？之光很感動地問。　　「大槪是在黑夜裏，帮着軍隊裏的人挖戰壕，打木椿」！林代表説。　　「那末」，之光衝口而出地問，「他們的工作竟是在前綫了」！　　「黑夜大槪都在前綫，白天多半是躱在附近各處做各人能　做的工。到了前線，自然就容易吃槍子了」！　　「這幾個受了傷的情形是怎樣的」？　　「有輕有重。輕的是打穿了手，打穿了肩膀，打穿了腿子；重的就是打穿了。聽説重的是難得醫的；還有打穿了肺的，聽説那還好醫」　　之光聽到這裏，陡然一下立起來：　　「我非去看看不可！廠裏眞有在閘北前線受傷的人」！　　「那些死了的還没有算，大槪一時也查不淸楚，張行狂」！　　「我非去看看不可」！之光又這樣説了一句，「尤其對於那些死了的更要想辦法」！　　「張先生」，林代表説，「傷了的和死了的，固然可憐；不過那些在閘北活着打仗的更可憐」　　「更可憐！更可憐！」許多人齊聲喊著。之光竟隨着大家垂涙了。　　「張先生」，林代表咽着嗓子説，「你要替那些死了的想辦法，我們眞贊成不過，你爲甚麽不替那些在閘北活着打仗的想辦法」？　　「我原是在這裏籌劃妥當的辦法」！之光誠懇地説。「只要」　　「張先生」，有一個代表搶着説，「你想去看看受了傷的工友，我們也贊成，你何不到閘北去看看那些活的呢？你看了，你就有妥當的辦法了！姚先生也就容易商量了！我們大槪每天都有人去，並且也都有人來」　　這段話不待説完，那幾個代表都高聲説：　　「張先生去罷，我們同着走。張先生去罷」之光這時候更興奮了，很興奮了，痛快地説：　　「我眞去，我眞去，請你們給我帶路」</p>

<p>談言談駡人  吾　　祇要看到這個近於下流的題目，少不了有人會駡我是品行卑劣的胡調朋友。然而這也不過是駡駡而已，我可以不丕在乎。多少聖賢豪傑有時也要給人謾駡，何况我這個缺德的小子。　　然而駡人一事，究竟是社會上眞實現象。駡人者痛快，被駡者氣忿。幾乎是苟無駡人一事，天下便不得太平。而現在所以如此太平者，正因爲駡人者太不講究藝術，以致被駡者不知痛癢，等於未駡一樣。所以現在所要談者，乃是研究怎樣駡人。所以這有功於世道人心，聊足以增進個人之福德。　　東洋人駡人，最刻毒的要算「馬鹿野郎」（Ｂａｒｃａｙａｒｏ）了，所謂「畜生」（Ｃｂｕｋｕｓｕｈ）到在其次。「馬鹿野郎」的直譯，應當是笨傢伙，而「畜生」者其義至明，照我們中國人比較起來，自然是畜生已非人類，不免比笨傢侎還要難堪。然而東洋却相反而行，令人莫解。西洋人最刻毒的言詞我不大了然，不過如「Ｆｏｏｌｉｓｈ　ｆｅｌｌｏｗｄ」或是「Ｂａｄ　ｍａｎ」等，都不見得是中國人的字典中最難堪的詞句。可是英國人的「Ｙｏｕ　ａｒｅ　ｎｏ　ｇｅｎｅｔｌｅｍａｎ」到是滿幽默的。然而這種文雅的言詞，更不爲國人所取。但是中國人駡人却其是利害，除了「Ｘ捺娘」極爲平常以外，簡直是從你的家主婆或是令妹起一直駡到你的祖宗三代。甚至於連已死去百十年的老婆婆也要遭殃。至於「笨傢」伙「畜生」「壞蛋」等，都不過開玩笑的時候説説的。所謂「你不是紳士」，更不合乎中國人的口吻。原來中國人從來對於性事認爲極大的恥辱。雖然駡人者不一定果然和被駡者的女人發生過性的關係，可是那始終是神聖不可侵犯，有甚於「泰山石敢當」。至於上海人的「赤老」或是「猪玀」，那簡直算不了駡人，不過是一種口頭禪而已。　　然而僅僅是如此臭駡，究竟未免平凡，而且有傷君子之風，頗不宜於長衫同志。并且你雖然惡聲相向的駡到他的乃祖乃宗，充其量不過是使他懂得你在駡他，同樣他也可以大聲回敬，如此如此，和你所駡的一般無二。所以善於駡人者一定要駡得别人耳紅面赤，哭笑不得。譬如當癩痢頭阿Ｑ走近米莊酒店的時候，只聽得别人説一聲「電燈亮了」，立刻感覺痛在心坎裏，於是頭上的白疤一塊一塊的紅將起來。像這種駡法，最爲有效。倘你看見鄭考胥或郝鵬等等，你切不可以駡他一聲漢奸，那是你得吃虧於他的權威之下的；反之，你正可恭維他説：「老兄，近來發財！中國眞是不得了哩，幸虧是你老兄出力。哈哈哈哈！」這樣一來，他不但不敢惱羞成怒，而且還得拱拱手假裝笑容的説：「豈敢豈敢！」然而他心裏到底是説不出的難受了。又如蕭伯納曾經受着美麗女伶的糾纏，她説：「假如我和你結了婚，生出來的孩子面貎像我，而頭腦却像你，你想那是多麽好啊」，誰知蕭伯納却回答説：「可不是麽，萬一不幸頭腦像了你而面貎又像了我，那眞是不得了哩」。如此駡法，自然是刻毒之至，可是可惜不能大衆化罷了。她夫敗了！  潔心　　Ｌ是一個和我在幼小的時候一直就最知已的同學，她有超人的思想，冷靜的頭腦，闊大的胸襟，奔赴的熱情，她眞夠説是一個有希望的少年老成！這學期我輟了學，在敎界服務，她也跟着我一同離開學校，她是在一家公司寫字間裏工作。雖説我們分離了，但在業餘空閒之時，我們老是極愉快地聚着談天或是討論什麽問題。　　因爲她的思想是高超的，是不　的，所以她對任何人都是以光明磊落的態度，純潔無疪的熱情。她對她的同事們，當然也不能例外。可是，出乎意料外的事，却因此而展開而向她作有力的襲擊，現在她的心是整個受了創痕，她悲痛，她大哭了！　　事實是這樣的。　　「女士：請求你莫誤會我，更請求你諒解我的苦衷吧！本來我們的交誼不過是學術上切磋的朋友，這態度我覺得是應有的。可是這磊落的行動，這光明的舉止，竟會受神經過敏者的詆議和毁謗。愚鈍若我，原是無足介意，可是間接連累了女士，這於内心是萬分的不願意的！所以今後我應當緘口寡言，免得意外麻煩的來襲，而覺得分外的淸爽。女士，這并不是好像因噎廢食。更不承認是弱者的默忍。不過爲了您，我確是强者的自抑啊！措辭冒昧，請求您原諒。　上。」　　她心裏充滿了悲哀，而臉上露着苦笑；我讀了這封信竟是茫無頭緒。問她這話打那兒説起呢？她便告訴我：「這位寫信給我的同事，他的環境和思想，是與自己很近似的。所以在平常談話的時候，我們覺得很投機很融洽，因此我們就不克多説了些兒。誰料這橫逆的襲擊便這樣無條件地迎頭向我們打來，潔啊？你想吧！我的心該是創裂到了怎樣的地步呢？現在我是徬徨歧途上了丨丨丨我還是繼續向前奮鬭呢？還是像Ａ君所説的屈服在可怕環境之下呢？」　　Ｌ女士不肯膚淺的貞操觀念和殘存的封建意識守壁壘。可是她是失敗了。她初出茅廬，初走上社會的征途，社會便給她這樣一個强有力的襲擊，這不太慘酷殘忍了嗎？唉丨我確信。思想純誠的女子决不是一瓶硝鏹水，但是一般輕浮没腦經的井底蛙般眼界的靑年男子。竟這樣的看待女子。而且津津自詡，不自知可憐，眞是些不要臉的東西！要想這些東西來爲國家社會謀幸福，這也是可能的嗎？一張官氣十足的招生廣告  昌　　沉没了五年在都市中的我，這次忽然得着了還鄉的機會，這是多麽快懷的事情？　　等我　腫的雙足，踏着了故土之後，第一件要知道的，當然是本鄉敎育發達的程度，巧極了！不用我去調查，竟有一張官氣十足的六言招生廣告，很顯明的昭示於我的眼前，我從頭至尾讀了一遍，已知我鄉的敎育，的確達到了包今統古的全盛時代了。現在一字不易的替他登一次義務廣告，也算是表示我擁護的熱忱。　　照得本校之設，原爲培樝人才，旣無牟利意見，更非誤人之輩，校長前淸廪生，堪誇道學深　，敎員中學畢業，各色功課俱備，手工唱歌圖畫，算學乘除中减，太學中庸論語，皆須嚴責熟背，學費减半收取，每節大洋三塊，朔望香燭免費，以示特别優待，爲欲嚴勤起見，一列不放禮拜，維持風化爲先，男女上課分班，學生八時到校，下午五時始歸，如此多敎多讀，可稱生面别開，校舍交通利便，課堂門窗朝南，校役服侍周到，茶水終日常備，大便坑缸在邇，小解尿桶兩對，路遠可以貼膳，一葷一素小菜，幼童如欲接送，本校亦可照辦，如此宏大規模，足見苦心一斑，曉爾全鎭知悉，家長盍興乎來，</p>

<h3>Governor Huang Fu's Instructions to County Magistrates in the War Zone</h3>
<p>Addressing both the Symptoms with Urgent Relief</p>
<p>Addressing the Root Causes by Revitalizing the Rural Economy</p>
<p>Starting on the 21st, Each County Will Be Received, with Tangshan and Beiping as Gathering Points</p>
<p>(Beiping) This morning at 9:00 AM, Yu Xuezhong led the county magistrates to Fengzeyuan to meet with Huang Fu and receive instructions. They did not leave until after 10:00 AM. Yu will return to Tianjin tonight or tomorrow morning. In the war zone, along the railway lines east of Zhonglu County, Fengrun, and Tangshan, in addition to the 4,000 security police reorganized from Li Jichun's troops stationed there, the Hebei Provincial Government will also dispatch 5,000 security troops to the war zone. 4,000 of them will be stationed in 19 counties to maintain public order, with 100 to 200 stationed in each county depending on its size. The remaining 1,000 will be organized into a security guerrilla force, stationed in central counties among the 19, to assist in resolving incidents that occur in other counties. Colonel Kita of the Kwantung Army arrived in Tangshan on the 15th to assist our side in handling the handover. As for the War Zone Relief Committee, the Political Readjustment Committee is actively preparing and is expected to be established in Beiping around the 21st. Of the one million yuan in relief funds promised by the central government, none has yet been remitted. The four million yuan in public bonds is also being prepared. (Special dispatch dated 17th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Huang Fu, in response to reporters' questions, stated that the matter of Chahar is still being addressed through the dispatch of representatives to communicate and mediate. It is hoped that it can be resolved peacefully and will not lead to extremes. The Tangshan Public Security Bureau has already been taken over by us, and we are now gradually moving forward with the takeover. The reorganization of the puppet troops is the same as reported in the newspapers recently. Detailed methods will be stipulated by the Military Affairs Committee. What he discussed with the county magistrates in the war zone today was the hope that, after the takeover, they would proceed with two points: (1) To actively and urgently provide relief to the disaster-stricken people in the war zone; (2) To pay attention to all matters related to the revival of the rural areas. The release of Hao Peng is true, as reported in the newspapers. (Dispatch dated 17th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The War Zone Relief Committee is scheduled to be established on the 21st. The takeover of the counties in the war zone will begin simultaneously on the 21st, regardless of whether Japanese or puppet troops have withdrawn from the areas. The county magistrates and public security bureau chiefs along the eastern route will gather in Tangshan to await instructions from receivers Lei Rong and Li Zeyi and take over step by step. The county magistrates and public security bureau chiefs along the northern route will gather in Beiping to await instructions from receivers Yin Tong and Tao Shangming and take office in turn, striving to complete the process by the end of the month. Yin and Tao are scheduled to go to Tianjin with the county magistrates of northern Hebei early on the morning of the 18th to receive instructions and return to Beiping before the 21st to begin the takeover work. (Special dispatch dated 17th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to a receiver, the reorganization of the puppet troops is proceeding smoothly. The funds for the reorganization of the puppet troops, the roster of personnel, and the receiving county magistrates and public security bureau chiefs are all prepared. Starting on the 21st, the takeover will begin simultaneously on both the northeast and northwest routes, regardless of whether Japanese or puppet troops have withdrawn from the counties. If any problems arise, they will be handled through negotiations with the Japanese side at any time. The opening of the Beining Railway is temporarily unable to proceed because the Japanese military transport has not yet been completed, in order to avoid hindering their transportation to Shanhaiguan. Since I previously communicated everything here via telegrams and was unable to report in detail, I went to Beiping after arriving and reported to He Yingqin in detail. (Special dispatch dated 17th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tao Shangming stated that he and Commissioner Yin will go to Tianjin tomorrow morning to negotiate everything with the Receiving Committee and will return to Beiping before the 21st to begin receiving the counties in northern Hebei. Currently, the Suzuki Brigade of the Japanese army is still stationed in Gubeikou and Miyun. The takeover will not wait for their withdrawal. Instead, the county magistrates will be led to Miyun to negotiate the takeover with the Japanese army, to avoid prolonging the time and delaying the work. (Special dispatch dated 17th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The receiving routes are divided into northeast and northwest routes to proceed separately. Except for the Tangshan and Linyu Special Public Security Bureaus, the remaining are to be received by the county governments. Tangshan is the gathering place for the eastern route. The receiving procedure will be instructed by the commissioners stationed in Tangshan. The counties and bureaus that should be received on this route are: Yu Naigan of the Tangshan Special Public Security Bureau, Yuan Shibin of Ninghe, who have already been received; Dong Zihua of Yutian, Zhang Renli of Fengrun, Zhang Jinchen of Lu County, Guan Gengyu of Leting, Liang Yu of Changli, Liu Enpei of Funing, Chen Zengshi of Lulong, Lu Qingchen of Qian'an, the Linyu Special Public Security Bureau is yet to be determined, Yin Shousong of Linyu County, and Dushan is yet to be determined. Beiping is the gathering place for the northern route. The receiving procedure will be instructed by the commissioners stationed in Beiping. The counties that should be received on this route are: Zhang Qixuan of Tong County, Wu Bao'an of Xianghe, Su Shijun of Shunyi, Jiang Dongping of Changping, Chen Baosheng of Baodi, Cao Zhen of Sanhe, Xu Wenquan of Huairou, Sun Shutang of Miyun, Li Xingzhuo of Pinggu, Sun Weishan of Jixian, Pei Huanxing of Zunhua, and Xinglong is yet to be determined. (Special dispatch dated 17th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yu Xuezhong, Tao Shangming, and Yin Tong, along with 22 county magistrates, returned to Tianjin by special train at 8:00 PM tonight. (Special dispatch dated 17th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yin Shousong is designated as the Administrative Commissioner of Ludong. (Special dispatch dated 17th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Xue Zhiheng and others in Tangshan are negotiating with Li Jichun and others regarding the issue of the reorganization and disbandment of the puppet troops. In addition to the number of people to be incorporated and the method of disbandment being in sight, the severance pay has also been slightly stipulated. Li requested an additional sum of money for the termination of his troops, which is currently being negotiated. It is said that the Tangshan consultations will be completed soon. At that time, the reorganization and disbandment of the puppet troops can be implemented. There is a proposal to incorporate 1,000 of Shi Yousan's troops from Qinhuangdao and move them to Yutian to be stationed, which has not yet been determined. (Special dispatch dated 17th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Although the list of county magistrates in the war zone to be received has been announced by the provincial government, it has not yet been approved by the standing committee of the provincial government. It is scheduled to be submitted to the standing committee for retroactive recognition on the morning of the 18th. 100,000 yuan for disbandment expenses was remitted first on the 17th, and the remaining amount will be remitted later. (Special dispatch dated 17th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Huang Fu is actively planning the steps to be taken for war zone relief, which is imminent. The War Zone Relief Committee is scheduled to be established within this week. (Special dispatch dated 17th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Provincial Relief Committee raised 20,000 yuan on the 17th and handed it over to the county magistrates of Wuqing, Xianghe, Baodi, Tongzhou, Sanhe, and Shunyi to provide relief to the extremely poor households in conjunction with the relief workers dispatched by the province. (Special dispatch dated 17th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) According to Qian Zongze, the date for the opening of traffic between Tangshan and Yushu has not yet been determined. It is planned to open traffic to wherever the takeover reaches. Japanese Consul Tanaka went to the Railway Bureau on the 17th to inquire about the date of the opening of traffic. (Special dispatch dated 17th)</p>
<h3>He Yingqin's Banquet for the Diplomatic Corps</h3>
<p>Unable to Attend in Person Due to Illness</p>
<p>Entrusted Liu Chongjie to Represent Him</p>
<p>(Beiping) He Yingqin hosted a banquet for the ministers and military attaches of various countries in Beiping at the Diplomatic Building in the evening. Soviet Ambassador Bogomolov, American Minister Johnson, British Minister Lampson, French Minister Wilden, and the ministers, chargés d'affaires, and military attaches of Italy, Belgium, Japan, and other countries all attended the banquet in person. He was unable to attend in person due to illness and temporarily asked Liu Chongjie to represent him. Huang Fu, Yuan Liang, and others were invited to accompany him. (Special dispatch dated 17th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After He Yingqin's acute pneumonia was treated by German doctor Staffa, his condition is good. His temperature today is 37.8 degrees Celsius. There should be no other changes. He should be discharged from the hospital in ten days. (Special dispatch dated 17th)</p>
<h3>Officers of Li's Troops Refuse to Accept Reorganization Order</h3>
<p>(Beiping) According to reliable Chinese sources, 17 officers under Li Jichun expressed dissatisfaction with the terms of the agreement negotiated between Li and the Beiping authorities and refused to comply with Li's order to gather troops in Tangshan to await reorganization. (Reuters dispatch dated 17th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Li Jichun's troops were originally planned to be gathered near Tangshan to be reorganized and disbanded separately. However, many of Li's junior officers, as many as 17, were very dissatisfied with Li's acceptance of the reorganization and refused to obey the dispatch, so there will be difficulties in handling the matter in the future and further consultation is needed. Li had requested that each person be appointed as a clearing and suppression officer in the area of Zunhua and Jixian, but this was not approved because the title was too large. It is said that another title will be given, which has been largely decided. The Japanese side's desired procedures for resolving the puppet troops have all been completed by our side. If internal problems arise within the puppet troops, appropriate measures will be taken to resolve them. (Special dispatch dated 17th)</p>
<h3>Who Are the Instigators of the Xinjiang Muslim Uprising?</h3>
<p>The Eastern News Points to Soviet Instigation</p>
<p>The Russian News Claims the Center Is in Tokyo</p>
<p>(Moscow) Today, the Soviet government gazette "Izvestia" commented on an article published in the Osaka Asahi Shimbun that claimed the Muslim uprising in Xinjiang was influenced by the Soviet Union. The newspaper stated that it is doubtful whether this clearly absurd accusation can be trusted, as it is well known that this rebellion is being carried out under the slogan of uniting the four peoples to resist the Han people, and the Muslim groups that instigated this movement have their center in Tokyo. These groups have published a newspaper and distributed it to all Muslims. The Izvestia newspaper declared, "The Osaka Asahi Shimbun is well aware that the exiled Turkish prince Abdel Kerim (grandson of the former King Abdel Hamid) is actively preparing in Tokyo, and if the Muslim uprising in Xinjiang succeeds, he will accept the rule of Xinjiang, and it has been proposed to appoint a number of active Japanese military officers and Turkish fugitives to reorganize the prince's strength." The newspaper concluded, "The Muslim rebels, who were yesterday the pawns of Tokyo schemers, have been defeated, so the Osaka Asahi Shimbun is eager to exonerate the attacked Japanese party and blame it on the Soviet Union." (TASS dispatch dated 17th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Russian newspaper Izvestia's comments on the situation in Xinjiang have aroused concern in Tokyo official circles. According to a Moscow news dispatch, the newspaper's editorial today stated that some Japanese schemers have helped the Muslim rebellion in Xinjiang and that the Turkish Prince Abdel Kerim is currently staying in Tokyo, preparing to be the future leader of the Muslims in Xinjiang. Official circles here say that there are no Japanese people in Japan who believe in Islam, nor are there any Muslim mosques, and there is no direct transportation between Japan and Xinjiang. As for Russia, it is different. There are modern transportation methods such as railways, telegrams, and radio between Xinjiang and Moscow. The Turkish Prince Abdel Kerim is indeed in Japan, but only as a world traveler, and he has just passed through Japan. (Reuters dispatch dated 17th)</p>
<h3>Gong Peng's Trip to Xinjiang Postponed</h3>
<p>Departure Set for the 25th</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Military Affairs Committee of the Executive Yuan appointed Peng Zhaoxian and Gong Bicheng as special commissioners to investigate Xinjiang affairs. They were originally scheduled to depart from Nanjing on the 18th, and the Executive Yuan had also reserved airplane seats on their behalf. Peng and others postponed the trip to the 25th of this month because preparations were not complete and because Ma Zhongying's bandit troops in Hami would not allow airplanes to pass and would bomb or detain them. In this case, the date of Huang Musong's return to Nanjing must be postponed again. (Special dispatch dated 17th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Peng Zhaoxian told people that the remnants of Ma Zhongying's troops in Hami and other places are planning to counterattack again. Because Eurasian airplanes cannot reach Dihua directly and traveling by boat is too slow, there is really no way to go. There was previously a proposal to send central government airplanes to escort the flight to Xinjiang, but the mechanics are not familiar with the route, so it is difficult to implement. They are now considering how to go to Xinjiang and will make a decision again. The departure date is set for the evening of the 18th to visit President Wang. (Special dispatch dated 17th)</p>
<h3>Tibetan Troops on the Opposite Bank of the Jinsha River Increase Troops and Attack</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Military news, confirmed from Ya'an, Tibetan troops on the opposite bank of the Jinsha River, taking advantage of Sichuan's civil war and its inability to take care of the border, have recently increased their troops by three generations in addition to the original force, and are planning to invade. The situation in Dengke is urgent according to frequent telegrams from the people of Xikang. The future of Sichuan's defense is extremely dangerous. (Special dispatch dated 17th)</p>
<h3>There is Hope for Unification in the Sichuan Situation</h3>
<p>Deng's Troops Occupy the Old City of Xinzhou</p>
<p>Liu Wenhui's Military Headquarters Moves to Qiongzhou</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chengdu, 16th: Among the Sichuan armies, Liu Xiang is the strongest, followed by Liu Wenhui, and then Tian Songyao. Now that Liu Wenhui's subordinates have rebelled and Tian has collapsed, they are determined to support Liu Xiang. Deng Xihou, Li Qixiang, and Luo Zezhou are even less of a problem. Yang Sen went to Chongqing a few days ago and made a definite statement early on. Liu Cunhou has limited troops. There is hope for unification in the Sichuan situation. (Special dispatch dated 17th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chengdu, 16th: Deng's troops occupied the old city of Xinzhou on the 14th and fought fiercely with Liu Wenhui across the river. The southern route army's attack on Jiading is also urgent. Liu Wenhui fears the loss of Jiading, cutting off his return route, and has moved his military headquarters to Qiongzhou. (Special dispatch dated 17th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Military news, Liu Wenhui withdrew from Chengdu. Liu Xiang ordered the troops of Tang Shizun, Pan Wenhua, Li Qixiang, and Luo Zezhou to cross the Min River from Renjing and other places on the 14th. Deng Xihou's troops also attacked Xinjin from Shuangliu Jinhua and Jie. Future warfare is likely to be unavoidable. (Special dispatch dated 17th)</p>
<h3>Li Du Arrives in Nanjing to Visit the Mausoleum</h3>
<p>Will Go to Jiangxi in Two or Three Days</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Li Du arrived in Nanjing on the morning of the 17th. Luo Dongfang, representative of the Military Affairs Committee, Peng Erkang, representative of the Municipal Party Department, and others welcomed them at the station. Accompanying him were Liu Piguang, Jiang Ying, Liu Guanren, Yang Nengshen, and others. After getting off the train, they went to the Central Hotel to rest briefly. They visited the mausoleum at 10:00 AM. In the afternoon, they separately visited Lin Fang, President Wang, and Zhu Peide and Tang Shengzhi to report on their resistance against Japan and their travels overseas, and expressed their determination to resist Japan and save the country in the future. President Wang hosted a banquet for Li at the Iron Department official residence at 7:00 PM to wash off the dust. Li told reporters that the ceasefire agreement was established, but it was only a military conclusion. The whole country must not allow the four northeastern provinces to be ceded to foreign races. In the future, only the government and the people can unite, remove prejudices, and work hard against foreign aggression in order to save the country from danger. Although Mr. Feng's resistance against Japan in Chahar is a patriotic action, it is a pity that he failed to stand on the same ground as the government and adopt a comprehensive approach. In the future, it is extremely hoped that Feng can obey his will to avoid ambiguity. More than 30,000 of his old troops are still left, some in Xinjiang and some on the border of Jilin Province, and most of them are still active in resisting Japan. However, they lack food and salaries. Fortunately, they have been helped by the local people and can barely maintain themselves. The issue of the disposal of his subordinates in the future will be discussed with the central government for a decision. He plans to stay in the Nanjing-Shanghai area for a while, and then determine the address after visiting Chairman Jiang. (Dispatch dated 17th)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Feng Yuxiang issued a circular telegram to the leaders of the military and political circles today, stating that although the recovery of Dolon Nor has fulfilled the responsibility of defending Chahar, the four northeastern provinces are still in enemy hands. He further requested the government to cancel the Tanggu Agreement and send troops to the northwest. If the government ignores it, he will lead 100,000 hungry troops to engage in the work of restoring the four northeastern provinces. As long as there is a breath, this ambition will not change.

The debt will be repaid on a monthly basis and will be fully repaid by the end of August. The construction fund is only set at 20,000 yuan, which is also difficult to allocate. Now the land tax and business tax will be completed and reorganized, and the province's treasury is expected to be richer day by day. Zhang's coming to govern will definitely have new developments. Zhang and Xia once held consultations that night and decided on the handover matters. (Special dispatch dated 17th)</p>

<h3>Central Memorial Week</h3>
<p>Ye Chucang Reports</p>
<p>The Relationship Between the Party and the News Industry</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Government held its 87th Memorial Week at 8:00 AM on the 17th. Ye Chucang, Ju Zheng, Zheng Zhannan, Li Ciwen, Wang Qi, Ke Xing'e, and other staff members, totaling more than 400 people, attended. Ju Zheng presided. Ye Chucang reported on the relationship between the party and the news industry, stating in general that before the 1911 Revolution, newspapers were only used by literati for writing, and had no political meaning. Later, newspapers became increasingly developed and gradually contained political works, so a close relationship developed with the party. Therefore, "trouble" was discovered from time to time, such as instructions on the publication of news. This "trouble" is precisely an expression of intimacy, just like the trouble that occurs between family members. Everyone should dispel the psychology of "fear of trouble" and use mutual assistance and cooperation to solve all troubles. Naturally, interest will arise. In addition to running newspapers for "individuals", newspapers have other functions. As for running newspapers for the "country" and for "news", the goals must be the same, and the views and hopes are no different from those of the party. The party should uphold the morality of respecting journalists, and journalists should also exert their due morality and work hard towards the goal of common interests.

<h3>Ju Zheng Reports on Revitalizing Rural Areas and the Nation</h3>
<p>At the National Government Memorial Week</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government held a memorial week on the morning of the 17th. Chairman Lin, Yu Youren, Ju Zheng, Chen Shaokuan, and other civil and military officials, totaling more than 300 people, attended. After Chairman Lin led the ceremony, Ju Zheng reported on the revitalization of rural areas and the nation, stating in general that society has recently paid much attention to the revitalization of rural areas and the nation, which can be said to be the best phenomenon in the midst of national crisis. The collapse of our country's rural areas is the result of the economic aggression of imperialism. On the one hand, it plunders our country's raw materials, and on the other hand, it promotes the development of coastal and riverine cities in our country. According to common sense, the development of domestic industry should enrich the rural economy. Why have European and American countries become increasingly prosperous since the industrial revolution, while our country has achieved the opposite? Because the development of power production is automatic, while our country is under the oppression and threat of imperialism. The financial power of cities is in their hands. This kind of abnormal development, the surface of the city is developing forward, but in reality it is intensifying the squeezing of the blood of the rural areas for international capital. Because international capital buys our country's agricultural products at low prices, processes them, and then dumps them on our country's market at high prices. Most of the consumers are farmers, and the rural economy is declared bankrupt. In the Manchu Qing Dynasty, people such as Li Hongzhang and Zhang Zhidong also paid attention to the industrial revolution, creating weaving factories, silk reeling factories, iron smelting factories, etc. Since then, various industries have emerged, but they have forgotten the rural problem, which is the foundation of the country for thousands of years. As a result, only the development of one or two cities has been created, while the rural areas have gradually declined. If we do not provide relief now, the entire China will be destroyed. Therefore, the central government has the organization of the Rural Revitalization Committee, and has borrowed 50 million US dollars from the United States to prepare for rural revitalization, and then increase tariffs to restrict foreign goods from entering, so that international capital reduces its power in China, so that agricultural products are not severely hit, and then abolish exorbitant taxes. Society and the government work together to make politics clear. After the rural problem is solved, everything else can get on the right track, which is also solving part of the revitalization of the nation. I hope that all comrades will work hard to assist the central government so that the rural problem can be solved as soon as possible, and then there can be talk of revitalizing the nation.

<h3>Shen Honglie Quietly Leaves Qingdao and Telegrams His Resignation as Mayor of Qingdao</h3>
<p>(Qingdao) Mayor Shen Honglie left Qingdao by car at around 3:00 AM on the 17th. According to Shen, if it were not for the National Products Exhibition and the North China Games being held soon, he would have left Qingdao earlier. In the instructions he gave before leaving, he handed over political affairs to Secretary-General Hu Jiafeng to act on his behalf. Before Hu returns to Qingdao, Councilor Zhou will act temporarily. It is said that when all sectors of society heard that Shen had left Qingdao, they would make further efforts to retain him. (Special dispatch dated 17th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Shen Honglie telegraphed Jiang and Wang his resignation, stating in general that he has been ineffective in managing his subordinates, causing the mutiny of three warships in the past, and then due to insufficient investigation, causing the generals to have exceeded their powers repeatedly, he is deeply ashamed. He has been studying since he was young and knows the general principles. If he continues to occupy a position without doing anything, he will have nothing to thank the government and nothing to thank Your Excellency. Moreover, he is deeply stimulated by this unexpected incident, his spirit is abnormal, and all kinds of diseases have broken out. The doctor said that unless he rests temporarily, there will be many dangers. In desperation, he plans to transfer to another place for treatment to avoid further delays. He asks for your understanding and forgiveness. As for the position of mayor, he also asks for the selection of personnel to take over so that they can take on their duties. (Special dispatch dated 17th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Shen Honglie left Qingdao secretly at 8:30 PM on the 16th. Before leaving, he telegraphed Jiang and Wang, firmly resigning from the position of Qingdao mayor, stating that he would transfer to another place to recuperate and asked for the prompt dispatch of personnel to take over. This morning, people in the navy and city government discovered that Shen had left and were very surprised. It is said that Shen took a merchant ship to Liugong Island in Weihaiwei, which has not yet been confirmed. All parties are discussing ways to retain him, but Shen's intentions are extremely firm. The North China Games just ended yesterday afternoon, and Shen left in the evening to avoid being retained by all parties. (Special dispatch dated 17th)</p>
<p>"Seeking Unification Through Construction"</p>
<h3>President Wang's Speech at the Executive Yuan</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) At the Executive Yuan's Monday memorial service on the 17th, President Wang gave a speech entitled "Seeking Unification Through Construction," in which he stated: "In Guangzhou in the past, I proposed the idea of 'seeking unification through construction,' but there was no response at the time. Recently, I mentioned it casually in Beijing, which aroused serious discussion in the Shanghai newspapers. Therefore, I would like to elaborate on the original proposition. Is it feasible to seek unification through construction? Is it possible to achieve unification through construction? Is construction possible before unification? The response to unification is division and confrontation. In addition to confrontation against the central government, there is also mutual confrontation between various regions, or mutual confrontation between two or more forces in the same region. If the situation of confrontation exists, both sides will compete to expand their military preparations. If Party A adds troops, Party B will also add troops, exhausting the people's resources. If the treasury's revenue is insufficient for military expansion, there will be no surplus to invest in construction. If we want to seek unification through construction now, wouldn't that be like climbing a tree to catch fish? This is my hypothetical refutation, and my response is as follows: If there is a situation of confrontation, the one who can build will win, that is, be able to unify; the one who cannot build will lose and be eliminated. Suppose there are two opposing forces. If Party A pays attention to construction, it will inevitably pay attention to the development of the people's productivity and the removal of the people's constraints and hardships. Therefore, in politics, it will strictly enforce integrity, avoid embezzlement and greed, and in the military, it will enforce strict discipline and avoid disturbing the people. With the people's lives and property guaranteed, engaging in agricultural construction will lead to the development of farmers' productivity and increased purchasing power. Industrial and commercial construction will also be carried out vigorously, leading to development. As the people's strength is enriched, the country's strength will also be enriched. On the other hand, if Party B does not pay attention to construction, but focuses on expanding military preparations, that is, does not pay attention to the development of the people's productivity, it will exhaust all the people's resources for military preparations, and the people's vitality will be exhausted, and its military dependence will also be shattered. When Party A and Party B meet, the victory or defeat will be clear. Seeking unification through construction does not forget the necessity of strengthening military force. Military force is an indispensable condition for national survival. In a world of the survival of the fittest, there is still justice to be spoken of when two strong powers meet. When a strong power meets a weak power, justice is just a name to be despised. It is not only ineffective to talk about justice without strength, but also shameful. Therefore, there is no objection to strengthening power, but do not forget that the source of military power is the people. Without the strength of the people, there is no possibility of strengthening military force. Modern military force is created by a rational social organization and scientific progress. Not only is there a special emphasis on the development of agriculture, industry, and commerce in the material aspect, but also on the tempering of morality and discipline in the spiritual aspect. This can never be achieved by abandoning construction and specializing in military expansion. If we specialize in military expansion, the more the military is expanded, the poorer the people will become. A small number of well-fed generals, leading a few hungry soldiers, surrounded by the majority of poor people, and meeting an army full of popular support, even if the numbers are different, what can be done with the people's disunity? Since the Republic of China, many warlords have held heavy troops, but once they collapsed, they could not rise again. The reason for this lies in this. Therefore, if you want to seek unification, you can only build. If you cannot build, you cannot even survive. What unification can be spoken of? Today's national affairs are indeed heartbreaking, but if it is heartbreaking that unification cannot be achieved, it is even more heartbreaking that the people cannot build. Since the Republic of China, the more we seek unification, the more divided we become. The biggest reason for this is that each has no construction. If there is construction, the people will never be impoverished and the wealth will be exhausted to this point. If one side has construction and the other does not, the people will come out to support those who have construction for the sake of their own interests. This can be asserted. Therefore, under the situation of confrontation, the results are nothing more than three ways: (1) Neither side pays attention to construction, but only knows how to compete with military force, and the result will be mutual loss and injury. (2) One pays attention to construction, and the other does not pay attention to construction. As a result, the builder wins and the non-builder loses. (3) Both pay attention to construction, and compete with each other with construction. As a result, economic relations become increasingly close, and division of labor and cooperation cannot be separated. Both automatically cancel the confrontational situation and demand unification. The above is the argument for seeking unification through construction, and it is also my only hope for the future of the country. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 17th)</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>The Problem of People in Today's China Zi</h3>
<p>In this newspaper's monthly publication "The Issue of China's Modernization," there is an article by Mr. Yang Duanliu discussing "The Decisive Issues for China's Modernization." First, he explains, "Material equipment, although indispensable, also has another important condition, which is that someone must use it." In conclusion, he says with emotion, "Now, if we want to learn from Germany, Italy, and Russia, we do not have Hitlers, Mussolinis, or Stalins. If we want to learn from Britain and the United States, we do not have a free and enlightened populace. This difficult problem is truly not easy to solve." Those two short paragraphs give us a lot of inspiration beyond the original topic.</p>
<p>China has recently reached an irreparable state, from the nation's politics to the state of society. If you ask why it is so bad, it is simply a problem of people. Other countries rely on the power of people's minds and can do things decently. China's affairs not only cannot be handled well by relying on people, but are also made worse by a group of incompetent people. In the past few decades, good laws and systems that were once effective in various countries have been almost entirely brought to China. The result is that "oranges turn into trifoliate oranges when transplanted north of the Huai River." Even if the patterns are fresh and beautiful, what can benefit the country and the people in other countries cannot have any good impact in China. In the past, some people liked to talk about national conditions, thinking that this was all due to the different national conditions. However, the facts are very clearly displayed before our eyes. China's national conditions are very capable of catering to new trends, and there will never be a rejection of good laws and systems from other countries. Recently, some people have used social characteristics, national characteristics, etc. to explain. Its impenetrability is just as honest as the people who talked about national conditions in the past. To be honest, it is simply a lack of "someone" condition.</p>
<p>Mr. Yang's original meaning is that to modernize China, it requires top-down political influence or bottom-up educational influence. Now, China does not have great leaders in politics, and the educational level of the general public is very rudimentary, so it feels difficult. In fact, not only the issue of China's modernization but all of China's problems can be explained in this sense. During the January 28th Shanghai War last year, some people talked highly about Turkey's resistance to foreign insults and national rejuvenation. However, people with the qualifications of a leader absolutely did not want to become Kemal. As for the Chinese people, although their level is not enough, judging from their struggles in the national crisis, they are not incapable of action. The biggest shortcoming of the Chinese people is, as MacDonald criticized the Indians, "They have become obedient guys, not citizens who do things." If they become obedient guys, they cannot be free and enlightened. Where will there be the strength to resist foreign insults?</p>
<p>The problem of people can be said to be the root of the China problem. If you want to solve the problem of people in China, you must first enable the Chinese people to become free and enlightened people. Then great leaders can emerge from these free and enlightened people.</p>
<h3>Japan Uniquely Opposes</h3>
<p>(London) The World Economic Conference began to conclude matters this morning. Various working groups met to discuss whether to draft proposals, or to request adjournment due to the deadlock in currency stabilization. The Japanese delegation issued a protest today, opposing the system of labeling the origin of goods, believing that this method is an obstacle to international trade and is sufficient to cause discrimination. The report of the Commercial Policy Committee has now been released. The report reiterates that the entire conference is in fact based on the stabilization of currency values. After analyzing the various reasons for disagreement, although some temporary reservations were made, it was generally believed that direct and indirect commercial restrictions must be eliminated soon. The report also earnestly advises on the need to reduce excessive tariffs through mutual agreements on both sides, and advocates the unconditional maintenance of the most-favored-nation clause. (Reuters dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>(London) With the future of the World Economic Conference at a critical juncture, some people are suggesting various ways to save the conference from complete failure. News from New York claims that some people are suggesting that the conference should be reconvened in Washington at an early date, and at the same time, the major countries should seek compromises through diplomatic channels. It is said that the U.S. delegation in London advocates indefinite adjournment, and the executive department should decide on the date of reconvening. (Reuters dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<h3>Drafting Committee on Commercial Policy Passes Resolution</h3>
<p>(London) The drafting committee of the Indirect Protection Policy Subcommittee of the Economic Conference passed a resolution recommending to various countries to include the following clauses in various commercial agreements, that is, if one of the contracting parties adopts a method that obviously harms the other party and changes the situation created by the treaty, then the other party may file a complaint to seek to restore the damaged balance. One of the contracting parties shall not refuse to consider such a complaint from the other party in good faith, but this obligation shall not apply to issues specifically stipulated in other parts of the treaty, such as tax rates. In addition, the resolution further advocates that the provisions of the November 3, 1932 Convention on "Simplification of Customs Procedures" must be observed. Finally, it believes that the issue of customs procedures has been fully studied by the Economic Committee of the League of Nations, and can be used as a basis to convene a special meeting for discussion.

<h3>Agreement on Silver Difficult to Achieve</h3>
<p>(London) It was recently learned from reliable sources that the United Kingdom is hindering the establishment of the eight-nation draft silver agreement. Therefore, due to British and Dutch opposition, the hope for a compromise on the silver issue has been greatly reduced. Moreover, it is said that even within the U.S. delegation, the opinions of Biddleman and Cousins are not consistent. (National dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<h3>Our Country Opposes Restrictions on Sugar Production</h3>
<p>(London) At the economic conference, sugar-producing countries negotiated methods to reduce production within five years. The Chinese representative stated that China imports more than twice as much sugar as it produces domestically, so the Chinese government cannot accept a reduction in production. The Indian representative said that the country is prepared to prohibit the export of sugar by sea or from Burma within five years, and said that a sugar conference is currently being held in Simla to study the issue of restricting production. The results of the meeting will be reported separately. The Japanese representative said that although the country exports refined sugar to China and "Manchukuo," this refined sugar is refined from sugar imported from Java. He accepted to inquire from his government whether it could stabilize production based on domestic consumption within a five-year period, while exports and imports should be offset.

<h3>Professor Moley's Trip to Britain Expensive</h3>
<p>(London) Professor Moley, President Roosevelt's special representative, was ordered to travel to London for a week, and the travel expenses were considerable. The U.S. delegation to the World Economic Conference is now quite concerned about this matter. It is said that the cost totaled about 600 pounds, mostly telephone charges for talking to President Roosevelt, including the cost of hiring an airplane to pick up Professor Moley in Kirk, but Professor Moley did not take it, costing 100 pounds. The State Department in Washington denied the London rumor that U.S. Chief Representative Hull did not recognize the travel expenses used by Professor Moley. According to Professor Moley, any expenses that should not be taken from the U.S. government will be paid out of his own pocket. As for the plane, it was pre-booked by the U.S. Embassy in London, but it was too late when he telegraphed to cancel it. (Reuters dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<h3>London Exchange Market Quiet</h3>
<p>U.S. Dollar Drops Slightly, Then Bounces Back</p>
<p>(London) The exchange market today was very quiet, with a slight tendency to sell British currency. The opening price of the U.S. dollar was 4.78, then it fell to 4.79, and then returned to 4.7775. The French franc rose from 85.31 to 85.21, due to the rumor of establishing an equalization fund.

<h3>Japan Expands Military Preparations and Diplomacy</h3>
<p>Navy Minister Osumi Expresses Opinions on Second Supplementary Plan</p>
<p>States That it is Necessary to Strengthen Naval Power in Extraordinary Times</p>
<p>Results of Consultations at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for Days</p>
<p>Decisions Made on Three Major Guidelines for Economic Diplomacy</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Navy Minister Osumi expressed the following opinions on the second naval supplementary plan: "Naval armaments are of utmost importance for national defense because Japan is an island nation. I believe the people can fully understand this matter. Naval armaments are governed by the international situation at the time, the naval strength of various countries, and the shipbuilding situation. However, since the Manchurian Incident, Japan has been in a rather difficult position internationally, both in the past and in the future, and the general public is also aware of this. On the one hand, the naval powers are making efforts to strengthen their naval forces. Japan cannot be satisfied with the insufficient troop strength stipulated in the London Naval Treaty, so it is within the scope permitted by the treaty to strengthen military preparations. No one can deny this. It is inevitable to extract a considerable amount of money from the national treasury for naval expenditure in such extraordinary times. If various countries restrain the expansion of armaments, understand Japan's fair claims, and the international environment improves, Japan will of course reduce naval armaments. However, no one can imagine that such a convenient situation will appear in the near future. In the Navy Ministry's budget for the next year, the second supplementary plan is an unavoidable and important plan. The current international situation is worse than when the first supplementary plan was made. The importance of the second supplement can be known." (Nichi-Rengo dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Uchida decided to establish a Manchuria-Mongolia Bureau in the ministry to adjust the policy toward Manchuria in order to implement Japan's autonomous diplomacy. In addition, a section will be added to the European and American Bureau to prepare for the discussion of the Pacific issue at the 1935 Disarmament Conference. Recently, it was decided to expand the foundation of economic diplomacy to deal with the economic warfare of various countries. Meetings have been held in the ministry for days to study specific methods. The meeting at 2 pm today seems to have formally decided on the expansion plan of this economic diplomacy agency. The content is roughly as follows: (1) In the current economic emergency, although the thorough determination of commercial diplomacy is expected, in view of the current state of domestic finance, efforts should be made to avoid setting up a huge agency. Only new requirements that are urgently needed are included in the budget for the ninth year. (2) The current two-section system for commerce will be changed to a four-section system. The following division of sections has been decided: Section 1: General affairs and all commercial policies. Section 2: Legal matters of commerce and trade. Section 3: Implementation management and protection and assistance of overseas enterprises. Section 4: Commercial reports and general investigations. (3) In order to develop all of Japan's commerce, commercial consuls will be dispatched to important new cities in Japan, namely the Near East, Southeast Asia, Central America, and South America.

<h3>Changchun Prepares for Japanese-Puppet Air Defense Drill</h3>
<p>(Changchun) The Kwantung Government is now cooperating with the Changchun authorities to prepare for an air defense drill in Changchun, and plans to train the people to defend against possible attacks from the sky, so that civilians will know what to do when attacked by aircraft. According to reports, Shenyang has also conducted this drill recently and achieved satisfactory results. (Reuters dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Warlords Recommend Muto to Implement Military Dictatorship</h3>
<p>Solving the Problems of Tax Increases and Military Expansion in One Breath</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Since the Seiyukai temporarily suspended internal strife, the political situation in Japan seems to be very stable on the surface. In fact, the conspiracies of various factions inside are still fierce. During the cabinet meeting on the budget this autumn, there may be a major change due to the issue of tax increases and rural unrest. The conspiracy situation of various factions is as follows: (1) The Ugaki faction colludes with the Kansai financial magnates and traders with China, using the anti-Suzuki faction of the Seiyukai and the Tomita-Izawa system of the Minseito as the basis, to plot for the next regime. (2) The Kuhara faction plans to form a joint cabinet with the Minseito. (3) The Araki faction will support Muto, Commander of the Kwantung Army, as Prime Minister, implement military dictatorship, solve the problem of tax increases, and expand military preparations. The three major forces are all eyeing each other, and the political circles in Japan will be very eventful this autumn. (China United Press dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<h3>Japan Unveils Anti-Communist Mask and Secretly Conducts Liaison with Russia</h3>
<p>Attempting to Open Up Domestic Economic Crisis</p>
<p>(Tokyo) In order to break through the domestic economic crisis, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has telegraphed its ambassador to Russia to raise the issue of trade with the Russian government. On the 15th of this month, the Japanese ambassador to Russia visited Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Sokolnikov and formally raised this matter. Mr. Sokolnikov said that the Russian side hopes that a formal Russian-Japanese trade treaty will be signed between Russia and Japan. Ambassador Ota does not take the form of a commercial treaty, believing that the current situation can also boost trade between the two countries. The Japanese government, on the one hand, publicizes to the world that it has an anti-communist vanguard, taking Manchuria with the ambition of preventing communism. Now, it secretly takes a policy of alliance, seemingly fearing that its treacherous diplomacy will be discovered. Today, in the name of the Minister of Intelligence, he told the press corps that what the Japanese side hopes for is the promotion of trade, and that there is no need for a so-called commercial treaty. The Japanese government does not want to sign a treaty. (China United Press dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<h3>Illegal Transactions on Eastern Railway</h3>
<p>Deadlock Cannot be Broken</p>
<p>Russia and Japan Conduct Private Negotiations</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The negotiations on the transfer of the Middle Eastern Railway are in a stalemate. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that the claims of the two countries are too far apart, and even if formal discussions are conducted, only complicated discussions will be exchanged. Therefore, if this situation is to be broken, it should be shifted to the form of private negotiations. It is more appropriate to prepare for formal discussions. The representatives of the two countries seem to have no objection to this opinion. It is said that Katzlovsky is preparing for private negotiations on the Soviet side, and Tadashi Ohashi is preparing for private negotiations on the puppet state side. Therefore, future negotiations will be conducted exclusively through private negotiations. In addition, former Ambassador to Russia Hirota will come forward to mediate. (Dentsu dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese newspaper reported that the Soviet representative visited Minister of Railways Mitsuchi a few days ago and requested mediation in the negotiations on the sale of the Middle Eastern Railway. The Soviet Embassy in Japan stated on the 17th that the above news was completely unfounded. (Nichi-Rengo dispatch on the 17th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Consul Explains Korean Resident Arrest Incident</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the report that Korean resident Wen Bo was arrested by the Japanese consulate without authorization, Japanese Consul-General in Beijing Shiroku Hidaka personally went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today to declare that both the surveillance and arrest by the Japanese agents were inaccurate. He also stated that Mr. Wen voluntarily went to the Japanese consulate due to environmental reasons and requested that he be sent back to Korea. I (Hidaka himself) have always advocated peace and respect for your country's sovereignty in my work in Beijing, and will never create evil precedents to harm the relations between the two countries. I am afraid that the rumors are untrue, so I hereby declare to your ministry, etc. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is still investigating the truth of the matter. (Special dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<h3>Draft Plan for Office for Purchasing American Cotton and Wheat on Credit Still Awaiting Review</h3>

According to the plan, Mr. Post originally intended to refuel and sleep in Novosibirsk.

<h3>Lithuanian Aviators Tragically Lose Their Lives</h3>
<p>Welcoming Crowd Waits in Vain</p>
<p>Nationalist, Berlin, 17th. Lithuanian aviators Darius and Girėnas had been preparing for half a year to fly nonstop from New York to Kaunas, the capital of Lithuania, and had finally set off successfully the day before yesterday. However, tragically, last night, not far from their destination, they crashed and died. This is deeply regrettable. At around 5:00 AM this morning, farmers working in the fields near the small town of Soldin in the Province of Brandenburg suddenly discovered a wrecked aircraft in the forest and immediately reported it to the Soldin authorities. The location was 120 kilometers northeast of Berlin. German officials were immediately dispatched to investigate. Next to the bodies of the two aviators, they found many maps and charts, all marking the air route from New York to Kaunas. In addition, there were several packets of American chewing gum, cigarettes, and chocolates. Later, they found a cloth cover with the names of Darius and Girėnas written on it, confirming that the two were indeed aviators. As for the cause of the accident, it is believed that after a long flight, they ran out of gasoline and were forced to land in the dark, causing them to hit the forest. According to nearby farmers who spoke to the police, they heard a crash at around 2:00 AM this morning, but did not pay attention to it at the time. Also, the weather near Soldin was bad that night, which may have contributed to the accident.</p>
<p>Nationalist, Kaunas, 17th. After midnight this morning, residents gathered at the Kaunas airfield to welcome the Lithuanian aviators Darius and Girėnas, who were crossing the Atlantic. It was reported that their plane had passed Stuttgart and was expected to arrive here at 3:00 AM. The airfield was brightly lit, and the welcoming aircraft had already taken off. Lithuanian Prime Minister Tubelis also personally went to the airfield to greet them. It is reported that the two aviators departed from New York at 6:24 AM yesterday, but there had been no news of them since. It was not until last night that a telegram was received from Oslo stating that an aircraft had passed the town of Florø on the Norwegian South coast at noon, and that because it was flying very fast, it could not be identified clearly, but it was believed to be the aircraft of the Lithuanian aviators. Later, at midnight, it was confirmed that they had flown past Stuttgart.</p>
<p>Nationalist, Kaunas, 17th. The two Lithuanian aviators had not arrived here by daybreak today. It is feared that they have been forced to land in a remote village between here and Stuttgart. The authorities have telegraphed various places along the route for inquiries. The welcoming crowd has dispersed and returned home, leaving only police officers guarding the airfield.</p>
<h3>German Government Establishes Economic Advisory Body</h3>

<h3>Opening of the Philippine Legislative Assembly</h3>
<p>New Governor Announces Policy Guidelines</p>
<p>Major Debate on Independence Issue Expected</p>
<p>Nationalist, Manila, 17th. The Philippine's Ninth Legislative Assembly convened its third regular session today. This is the final session of the current members, and the issue of Philippine independence will also be decided at this time. Currently, the Quezon faction, which advocates rejecting the Philippine independence bill, and the Osmeña and Roxas factions, which advocate accepting it, are all gathering their strength and uniting their comrades to prepare for a major battle. It is expected that the debate in the next 100 days will be even fiercer than the split of the Kuomintang ten years ago. Given the current situation, the rejection faction seems to have a sufficient majority to implement its proposal. However, its leader, Quezon, has so far agreed to have the National Assembly vote on the bill in order to gauge the true will of the people, as many Nationalists also echo this proposal. Because the current members of the Assembly were not elected to vote on the independence bill, their views on the independence bill may not necessarily reflect the views of the majority of voters. Today's meeting only held the opening ceremony. The Senate and House of Representatives held a joint session to listen to Governor Murphy's speech. After electing members of various committees, the meeting was adjourned. Murphy's speech on Wednesday listed the important issues to be considered in the next 100 days, but did not make any recommendations on the independence bill, as he stated at the beginning of his term that he would not interfere in the matter. The major bills to be considered by this session include the establishment of a permanent trade bureau in China, women's suffrage, public works funding, and unemployment reduction programs.</p>

<h3>Proceedings of the World Economic Conference (Berlin Correspondence) (Continued)</h3>
<p>(3) Representatives from France, Italy, Japan, and Germany Express Their Views</p>
<p>The London World Economic Conference held its opening ceremony on June 12th. The 13th was the date for formal discussions. At the meeting that day, Chairman MacDonald first reported on the proceedings of yesterday's opening ceremony and the organization of special committees, namely (1) the organization of the Monetary Committee and (2) the organization of the Economic Committee. He then announced the order for representatives from France, Italy, Japan, and Germany to express their views on the conference. After the announcement, French representative Daladier immediately took the stage to express his first opinion on the agenda to the conference. His speech was very long. He first described the increase in the number of unemployed people and its disastrous impact on the reduction of production and commerce. He did not want to explore the causes of the economic downturn. Then he immediately pointed out the plight of agriculture and the misuse of credit policies and the bankruptcy of the monetary system after the war. How can we create a new world from such a desolate economic state? He then put forward the following four proposals: (1) First, it is necessary to eliminate the monetary war and the instability of the monetary system. The freedom to maintain the activities of gold coins must never be lacking for a day. If the standard of value is dominated by sentiment or chance, then it is impossible to seek the smooth flow of goods and conclude permanent commercial agreements. (2) Producers must establish mutual supervision treaties with each other in order to determine the production volume based on the desires of real needs and obtain rational production. Such treaties must first be implemented in industrial countries, especially for important production categories such as chemical products, and then seek their universalization to agricultural products. (3) It is necessary to immediately make the greatest efforts to improve labor organization and implement the new system of a 40-hour work week. (4) Implement a public labor service system, with methods carried out in accordance with the recent resolutions of the International Labor Organization. Finally, he specifically requested that all countries abandon all work on economic warfare at the same time. Each nation must unconditionally decide on its aspirations to restore general world trust through freedom and local cooperation.</p>
<p>The opinions expressed by Italian representative Jung were simpler than those of the French representative. He first specifically and solemnly said that before we talk about raising the level of international prices and controlling tariffs, we should first think about solving the issue of war debts. To improve world economic relations, the most important task is to stabilize the world monetary system. In addition, the system of joint and several liability for economic groups currently being implemented in Italy is a good example for countries around the world and hopes everyone will pay attention to it, etc. There were no other special opinions. Japanese representative Toditi was the third speaker after the Italian representative. His opinions were almost entirely based on the interests of Japan itself. He did not consider that he should be speaking on behalf of the common overall economic interests of the world. He said that the world should maintain free trade, open doors for all countries, and share benefits equally. These boring words were almost all directed at China.</p>
<p>The speech of German representative Freiherr von Neurath was relatively special in several respects. The German representative said that in the future, international debts should be repaid with goods or services. This method is the only way to save the German economy from panic, especially in its current state. The economic and financial issues listed on the conference agenda cannot be resolved independently and must be liberated in parallel. According to the opinion of the German government, represented by him, the problem of commercial policy must first be solved by solving the problem of credit and finance. The world generally agrees that the interests of each country are extremely inconsistent. He also never denies this, but he said that in fact, the unrest of one country is the unrest of the world. If industry cannot be maintained, then agriculture cannot be safe and sound. If international debtors cannot survive, creditors cannot survive either. He hopes that the representatives of various countries will abandon the partial interests of their motherlands and properly seek the welfare of the world's masses and the other party. Only by restoring the peaceful and harmonious struggle of all the world's peoples can we find a way out for world politics. This view is also recognized very clearly by the German government. This proposition has already been seen in German Chancellor Hitler's foreign declarations. Finally, he also mentioned the issue of world disarmament in connection, saying that the successful outcome of the World Economic Conference may not be a good foundation for the issue of disarmament.</p>
<h3>(IV) World Opinion's Expectations for the Conference</h3>
<p>After the opening of the World Economic Conference, global public opinion has once again focused its attention on the Geological Museum in London, on the words and actions of the 168 representatives of economic giants from various countries around the world. In particular, the public opinion of the four major countries of Britain, the United States, France, and Germany is paying special attention to the movements of this World Economic Conference, and therefore they also have special expectations for the conference. The day before the World Economic Conference opened, the newspapers of the four countries of Britain, the United States, France, and Germany seemed to have received orders from the commander-in-chief of any opinion alliance. All newspapers, large and small, published lengthy and repetitive opinions, expressing their urgent and important propositions to contribute to the conference, seeking adoption, or proposing various conscious advices, hoping for the enlightenment of the conference. On the other hand, they sincerely and earnestly wrote their compliments, praising the representatives who are working hard for world economic cooperation. However, the attitudes of various countries' public opinions towards the economic conference are quite different. Regarding what results this World Economic Conference will be able to achieve, France has no predictions on this issue, maintaining a silent and waiting attitude. The majority of Germany's voices affirm that world economic cooperation is impossible before the war debt problem is fundamentally resolved. Therefore, they are more pessimistic than optimistic about the conference. The United States is working hard at the White House every day to promote world unity, world democracy, and national cooperation. They attach great importance to the joint work of representatives from all countries. Their ideal is to believe that the way to achieve world democracy is through meetings, so they are always optimistic about this London conference and believe that the conference will have promising results. Britain's attitude has always been the so-called mature attitude of watching the wind and steering the rudder on major world events, but The Times of London has already expressed a little pessimism about this conference. Perhaps because the current situation is difficult, it is unpredictable whether this will encourage the representatives and seek good results from the conference. Moscow deeply suspects that the conference may have an unfavorable impact on the special economic system of the Soviet Union. On the other hand, socialists believe that economic panic is a problem with the economic system itself, and cannot be saved by simply seeking cooperation. Therefore, Moscow's public opinion, in addition to ridiculing the unsustainability of capitalism, has no other expression.</p>
<h3>(V) Conclusion and Criticism</h3>
<p>Indeed, this World Economic Conference has 66 countries participating, with 2,000 representatives attending. It is truly an unprecedented event in the history of mankind. Future authors of world history will undoubtedly occupy one page of glorious historical facts for this London World Economic Conference. The significance and mission of this conference are indeed very important, and according to the report of the conference chairman Mr. Mai, this conference will have two months of long-term discussion time, which means that good results must be achieved during this long-term discussion. However, whether good results can be obtained is also a matter of the fate of the conference. The reporter believes that modern world political leaders often start by convening representative meetings to solve world or international problems, hoping to resolve difficulties by talking and laughing at a long table, which is slightly better than the era before the war when they blindly engaged in armed struggles and threats, and took alliance and treaty signing as pride, and victory and submission as glory. In terms of political skills, there is progress now, and mankind is temporarily trending towards peace and coordination. From this point of view, we should congratulate and praise this World Economic Conference. However, on the other hand, examining the current international situation, national nationalism is developing extremely. The new slogans of self-sufficiency, self-reliance, self-rescue, self-protection, autonomy, self-strengthening, self-help, self-awareness, self-defense, self-encouragement, and self-motivation are surging for a time, sweeping across Europe, and forming a parallel trend with the cries of international coordination, cooperation, support, and mutual assistance. Because of this contradictory reflection of world political thoughts, the League of Nations, although it exists, is equal to nothing, and the disarmament conference, which is discussed but not implemented, although the representatives of various countries have been discussing with exhausted tongues and throats, the result is futile, and the representatives have worked hard for nothing. How can today's World Economic Conference escape the possibility of being dominated by this contradictory human thought? Those who are knowledgeable will naturally know that it is impossible. Moreover, the current world economic panic phenomenon is indeed a collapse problem due to the imperfection of the capitalist economic organization itself. Therefore, before the capitalist economic system is fundamentally transformed, overproduction, unemployment, currency wars, commercial wars, and tariff wars are inevitable phenomena, which cannot be resolved by coordination, and it seems that there is no possibility of coordination. Please take China as an example. China is in a ring of the current world capitalist society. Before abandoning the capitalist economic creation, it can only actively promote the development of China's national capitalism in international opposition, so as not to lag behind and be threatened by the wealth of large capitalist countries, causing itself to be in an unfavorable position of being oppressed. However, under the current economic organization situation in China, how can we develop and extremely promote the development of China's national capitalism? I believe that there is no other way but to increase tariffs, to actively and strongly increase tariffs, and to actively encourage commercial warfare. Increasing tariffs can reject the import of foreign goods and revitalize the development of domestic industry. Encouraging commercial warfare can develop overseas trade, so as to enable China to achieve a surplus position, so that China's national wealth will not be impoverished by daily depletion and monthly reduction. (According to the statistics of China's import and export goods in recent years, China's import surplus has exceeded 400 million yuan in recent years, which will inevitably impoverish China, which is very obvious). Therefore, for China's sake, we must not and cannot abandon the policy of raising tariffs and commercial warfare. On the contrary, countries with developed capitalist industries extremely hope that China will abolish tariffs, so that their large amount of excess products can flood the Chinese market, and can freely absorb our country's money as much as possible, so that China can quickly enter the hell of economic bankruptcy. Based on this theory, China not only cannot seek compromise on the tariff truce of the conference, but should, in fact, oppose it for the sake of its own future. I deeply hope that the Chinese representatives will pay the greatest attention to this. The situation of emerging countries such as India, Mexico, and Turkey has the same requirements as China. As for Germany, it is now carrying out an active and vigorous economic self-sufficiency movement, even banning the import of butter from Ceylon. If you want to smoke a British-produced cigarette in Germany, you can't buy it even with a lot of money. You can see how strict its tariff defense is against British goods. How can this seek international economic compromise? Isn't it a dream? To be honest, unless the world reaches the era of great unity, with no national boundaries or racial distinctions, tariffs, like China's likin, can be naturally and reasonably abolished. Otherwise, they must be continued to be extended. In addition, regarding the currency issue, according to the opinion of the world economic giant Cassel, unless the world establishes a unified and equal new currency system, the financial chaos in the world cannot be avoided. But how can we create a world unified currency system before the world is unified? Isn't this another dream? In short, according to the facts, it is obvious that the easy achievement of the ideal results of this World Economic Conference is not possible.</p>
<h3>Japan Urgently Builds the Jihui Railway, Attempting to Control East Asia</h3>
<p>The Tokyo Asahi Shimbun published a dispatch from special correspondent Yoshiichi Imai, stating that the opening of the entire Jihui Railway line is now considered an urgent matter. The connection between the Dunhua-Tumen Northern Loop Line and the Korean Railway's Tumen Eastern Loop Line facilitates transportation between Manchuria's interior and the Sea of Japan, marking a historically significant event. In other words, the opening of the Jihui Railway line holds significant value for Japan in terms of military, political, and economic aspects. Since the outbreak of the Manchurian Incident, our country has considered the construction of railways in Manchuria to be an extremely urgent matter. The Haike Line connecting Harbin and Qiqihar, the Labin Line connecting Harbin and Lafa, and the line from Dunhua through Juzi Street to Tumen, crossing the international bridge and connecting with the Korean Railway's Tumen Eastern Loop Line, all have close relationships with Japan. Among them, the Dunhua-Tumen Northern Loop Line bears a particularly important mission. At present, the South Manchuria Railway Company has invested a huge sum of 40 million yuan to accelerate construction, designating Rajin Port, the end point of the line, as the shortest major artery between Japan and Manchuria by land and sea. The Dunhua-Tumen Northern Loop Line was completed on April 20, and the Dunhua-Tumen Southern Loop Line is expected to be completed within the year. The main economic purpose of this trunk line is to transport the treasures of northern Manchuria, such as soybeans and other special products, as much as possible, thus forming two major arteries with the South Manchuria Railway. Once the construction of Rajin Port is completed, taking Changchun as the center and heading to Osaka via Rajin Port will shorten the distance by 662 kilometers compared to passing through Dalian via the South Manchuria Railway, and by 580 kilometers compared to passing through Busan. Recalling that in the 32nd year of Meiji (1899), twelve British warships entered the port, and during the Russo-Japanese War, Admiral Kamimura's fleet also waited in the port while pursuing the Baltic Fleet. If the construction is completed, in terms of economics, millions of tons of cargo collected and distributed in northern Korea, except for approximately one million tons at the Unggi and Chongjin ports, can all be absorbed here. In the future, with the opening of the entire Jihui Railway line and the completion of the connection between Korea, Manchuria, Mongolia, and the Japanese mainland, Japan can be assured of controlling Korea and Manchuria and defending against foreign enemies.</p>
<h3>Japan Enacts All-Army Leave Due to Manchurian Invasion</h3>
<p>The Nagoya Shimbun reported on the 9th that one year and ten months have passed since the outbreak of the Manchurian Incident. During this period, the Japanese army has been stationed and fighting in various parts of Manchuria, and has also pacified the Jehol-Great Wall region, sufficient to maintain the security of "Manchukuo" and eliminate all obstacles. Therefore, the purpose of the Japanese army's actions can be said to have been completely achieved. The army authorities anticipate that the current situation can be maintained in the future and that no unexpected events will occur. If the season of high fruit yields arrives and there are no more disturbances, it has been decided to lift the state of war by October of this year and to allow the entire army to take leave in February and March of next year. The General Staff Headquarters of the Ministry of the Army and related army offices across the country have stipulated that wartime allowances will be abolished from July 1, and that the payments for family support of units in Manchuria and other regulations will be cancelled from March of next year when the state of war is lifted. The soldiers' salaries were increased by more than 50% during the war, while the salaries of the garrison troops in Manchuria during peacetime can be reduced by 40%. In this way, overall military expenses can also be reduced considerably.</p>

<p>Japan's Radical Left-Wing Movement (Japanese Communication)</p>
<h3>From Student Reddening to Army Reddening</h3>
<p>The number of left-leaning students in Japan who have been arrested and prosecuted by the judicial authorities, from 1928 to the present, is 2,499, and there are 761 others whose prosecution is temporarily reserved. Since 1928, the number has increased year by year. If we include the left-leaning students who have not been discovered by the political authorities, the exact number is difficult to count, but it is at least more than 10,000. The judicial authorities severely suppress after the incidents have already occurred, and the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Internal Affairs also have special agencies to crack down on ideological deterioration, but the effect is minimal. It seems that the more it cracks down and the more it oppresses, the more severe the left-leaning reaction becomes.</p>
<p>There is nothing mysterious about the reason why left-leaning thought has become so radical in student circles. To put it bluntly, it is the attack of the economic panic. Although Japan maintains a relatively good market on the surface, in reality, the general social situation, from rural life to urban life, is gradually deteriorating. Even if we try our best to stimulate it with military-demand industries, the result can only maintain the surface. Except for the stability of a very small number of people, the vast majority of hardworking people are always getting worse and worse. Therefore, the thoughts of all classes are shaken. Those who go to the extreme right use historical inertia to stimulate the masses, make them recall the past, expand their barbaric psychology of outward development, and engage in active aggression. Those on the extreme left are dissatisfied with the various aspects of the current society and want to actively engage in reform. Such reforms not only conflict with Japan's current rule, but also hold a fundamental negation attitude towards the capitalist system. The people who hold this attitude are not only the laborers, but also the children of middle-class families are aware of this, because Japan's unemployment panic is especially severe in the intellectual circles. College students cannot find jobs after graduation, or even those with existing jobs are laid off. At the same time, their family situation is also collapsing day by day, rushing towards bankruptcy. They themselves are constantly feeling the panic of the difficulty of life. Therefore, the right-leaning thought seeks a way out from military aggression, and the left-leaning thought takes the yearning for the socialist system as the premise, each going to extremes and cannot be stopped.</p>
<p>The military authorities and political authorities in Japan are making every effort to support the practical actions of right-leaning thought and all right-leaning groups in order to promote its aggressive policies. The greatest pressure is applied to left-leaning people and left-leaning groups to gradually eliminate them. Recently, the government's policy is to wipe out left-leaning thought in one fell swoop. Little does it know that it grows as quickly and as abundantly as bamboo shoots after rain. It will grow back quickly after it is destroyed. For example, the Kyoto Incident occurred in September of last year, and it is only now fully known to society. Only a part of the local organization has 401 people arrested, including 60 students from Kyoto Imperial University and about 50 from other schools. Among these people, there are several children from the so-called upper class, such as the second son of Osaka Mayor Dr. Sekiichi and the eldest son of Kyoto-elected Congressman Kawabashi Toyojiro, who are working for left-leaning groups. They have used a lot of energy for the labor movement. For example, in the labor movement of the Kyoto Municipal Electric Company, they have also organized commando teams in large factories such as Kanebo Textile, ready to prepare for actual struggles with the other party at any time. They also have concrete reddening plans for large stores such as Daimaru and Takashimaya, and they are also implementing reddening education for farmers in nearby rural areas. Moreover, in addition to the mass movement, there is also an attempt to redden the army. On the walls of various regiments under the jurisdiction of the 16th Division of Kyoto, there are slogans such as "Oppose War" and "Oppose Aggression" everywhere. At the same time, red organizations have secretly emerged in the 9th Infantry Regiment, the 33rd Regiment, and the 38th Regiment. In order to maintain military prestige, the authorities are currently strictly prohibiting the publication of records about the reddening of the army. In the navy, the Maizuru Naval Works Department has long been infiltrated by red elements, fundamentally corroding the naval port.</p>
<p>This round of movement, in terms of thought and in terms of educational relations, has already made the Japanese political authorities very embarrassed, because the students of Kyoto University, joining left-leaning activities in groups, has given Japanese youth great stimulation and had a very bad impact. And with such "deterioration" spreading into the army, causing corrosion, the "weapons" of the Japanese warlords are gradually about to be transformed into weapons of the opposing side.

<h3>Yellow River Conservancy Commission's Yellow River Management Project Plan</h3>
<p>Measuring River Channels and Establishing Hydrological Stations</p>
<p>Emphasis on Both Guidance and Land Reclamation</p>
<p>Beijing News: Since the Yellow River Conservancy Commission established a preparatory office in Beijing a month ago, the internal facilities have been largely organized. At this time when the lower reaches of the Yellow River are silted up and the river is overflowing, it is imperative to govern as soon as possible to prevent relocation of the river. The Association, during the preparatory period, first formulated the first step of the Yellow River management plan, and submitted it to the National Government for approval. Once the funds from the Ministry of Finance are received, it will proceed according to the planned plan. The reporter has obtained the following plans:</p>
<h3>Measuring River Channels</h3>
<p>The measurement work is divided into four sections. The section from Gong County to the river mouth is about 850 kilometers long. The distance between the two embankments is 15 kilometers in some places and 4 kilometers in others. Now, the estimated measurement width is 30 kilometers. The shape of the riverbed and the topography of both banks are measured, and topographical maps with scales of 1:5,000 to 1:10,000 are drawn. If four measuring teams are organized, it can be completed in about three years. The section from Gongcheng to Hancheng is 400 kilometers long, and a topographical map with a scale of 1:10,000 is surveyed and drawn. The section from Hancheng to Tokto is 600 kilometers long, and a topographical map with a scale of 1:10,000 to 1:20,000 is also surveyed and drawn. The measurement area is slightly narrower in the mountain canyons. If the construction works are like sluice dams, the measurement will be more detailed, and about two teams can complete it in two years. The section from Tokto to Shizuishan is also about 600 kilometers long, and a topographical map with a scale of 1:10,000 is also surveyed and drawn, and two teams can complete it in about two years. Above Shizuishan, a longitudinal section of the river channel and a cross-section measurement will be temporarily made. One team can complete it in about two years. The topography of the upper reaches of the Yellow River and the situation of the river mouth are generally measured by aircraft. If five measuring teams are organized in this way, it can be completed within five years. Hydrological measurement includes flow velocity, flow rate, water level, sediment content, rainfall, evaporation, wind direction, and other records related to climate. The locations where hydrological stations should be established are Gaolan, Ningxia, Wuyuan, Hequ, Longmen, Tongguan, Yijin, Gong County, Kaifeng, Yucheng, Shouzhang, Luokou, Qidong, Lijin, and the river mouth, as well as Xining in the Huangshui River, Didao in the Taoshui River, Hejin in the Fenshui River, Huayin in the Weishui River, Gong County in the Luoshui River, and Huzhi in the Qinshui River. The locations where water level stations should be established are Guide, Tokto, Jia County, Shan County, Zheng County, Dongming, Putai, Fenyang in the Fenshui River, Xianyang in the Weishui River, Luoning in the Luoshui River, and Yangcheng in the Qinshui River. Each river affairs bureau is also ordered to set up water level stations along the way.</p>
<h3>Guidance Plan</h3>
<p>According to the above plan, the guidance work can be implemented about four years later. The work items are as follows: (A) Clearing the downstream river channel, in other words, tidying up the cross-section of the downstream river channel and dredging the river mouth. Excessive sediment content in the river water is a major problem of the Yellow River. In order to prevent the river channel from being silted up, there must be reasonable regulations on the flow velocity and cross-section. In this way, the river channel is deepened, and the water flows underground. The method is to use dike tying or groin, depending on local conditions. (B) Correcting the river route. The over-curvature of the river channel is one of the downstream diseases, so there are many places that should be straightened. However, at the same time, the existing facts should also be taken into account. After estimating the situation, it should be stipulated where should be straightened and where should be changed to an arc, and it should also be handled step by step. (C) Setting up rolling dams. Rolling dams should be set up at appropriate locations on the inner embankment so that when the flood surges, it can overflow and flow between the inner embankment and the outer embankment, which can not only avoid the danger of breaching, but also silt up the land between the two embankments to consolidate the terrain. However, it must be tested and handled with caution to avoid the river water being diverted due to dredging, weakened due to diversion, and silting up the riverbed due to weakness. (D) Setting up valley dams. Setting up dams horizontally in mountain valleys can not only reduce floods, but also precipitate silt and level hills. The topography of the main and tributary streams should be considered, and the small ones should be guided by the people to set them up, and the large ones should be done by the government. (E) Developing hydropower. There are many places along the river where hydropower can be developed, and it should be utilized, with measuring the river mouth being the first thing. (F) Opening up navigation. The upper and lower reaches of the Yellow River must be tidied up to facilitate navigation. Where the drop is too large or there are reefs obstructing, sluices can be set up to raise and lower the water, or obstacles can be removed. (G) Reducing sediment. After the sediment enters the river, it should be carried to the sea to settle. However, for the sake of fundamental treatment, it is better to reduce its source as much as possible. The method is to strictly prevent the collapse of both banks, and to select new sand-avoiding routes. Furthermore, it is to cultivate forests, level terraced fields, and open ditches. (H) Preventing breaches. After the implementation of various new projects, the water will flow underground, and the flood disasters can be gradually reduced. However, we should still make every effort to protect it.</p>
<h3>Land Reclamation Steps</h3>
<p>Land reclamation work is beneficial to the river channel and increases production, which is really beneficial. The steps of land reclamation are described as follows: (A) Restoring ditches. The method of water management includes setting up valley gates to control water, but reservoirs are prone to siltation. If they are dispersed into ditches, it is like a billion small waterwheels, which can hold water and retain silt. The silt is taken after stagnation, which can fertilize the fields, benefit agriculture and water. However, the terraced fields in the northwest must be ordered by the government to lead the people to level and tidy them up before adding ditches to be effective. (B) Tidying up the river mouth delta. The river mouth delta is silted up with 3 million mu of fields, and the river channel is constantly changing, making it difficult for the water to flow smoothly. It is a pity to abandon rich resources on the ground. We should start governing immediately, so that engineering and farmland can both benefit. (C) Tidying up river beach wasteland. There is a lot of wasteland along the banks of the river, either due to changes in the river channel or due to the silting up of the banks, most of which are uncultivated land, such as the banks of the river in Henan Province and the Hanhe and Chaohua areas in Shaanxi. (D) Silting up alkaline land. Most of the alkaline land along the river is barren, and the price per mu is extremely low. Taking Shandong as an example, there are already nearly 10,000 qing. There are also many others along the coast of Henan and Hebei provinces. If they can be tidied up properly, barren land will become good land, and the benefits will be great. (E) Land reclamation in the Hetao area. There is still a lot of uncultivated land in the Hetao area, which should be reclaimed. (F) Irrigating fields. Irrigation work should be carried out in the upper reaches of the Yellow River and its tributaries. Moreover, the</p>
<p>rainfall is scarce in the upper reaches, so it is especially necessary to do it. However, in the lower reaches, it is necessary to consider it carefully. Because there are few tributaries below Gong County, if a large amount of water is diverted to irrigate the fields, most of the water taken will be the water from the surface and the riverbank, and the sediment content will be less. Therefore, the percentage of sediment content in the river water will inevitably increase. Therefore, the lower section of irrigation should be considered when designing the cross-section of the river channel. (Daily News)</p>
<h3>鎭江婦人發痧猝斃</h3>
<p>In Zhenjiang, a Woman Suddenly Died from Heatstroke</p>
<p>At the entrance of the Xin Jiangsu Newspaper office on Boxian Road, at about 1 PM yesterday, a 49-year-old woman named Jiao Wang from Haizhou suddenly suffered heatstroke and collapsed on the roadside. The newspaper office sent her to the Provincial Hospital for treatment, but she died before arriving. Li Zhenfu, the local police officer, reported the incident to patrol officer Yin Benti, who instructed the local headman Liu Xiang to request a court inspection. Prosecutor Du and others arrived to inspect the scene. The Chamber of Commerce President Lu Xiaobo provided a coffin and arranged for burial. The deceased left behind two children, a boy who was sent to the Poor Children's Home and a girl who was sent to the Relief Center.</p>
<p>Gaoyou Negotiation for Ransom Foiled by Bandit Detention</p>
<p>Two farmers, Zheng Fukuan and Li Xu, from Yingzhuang Town, the fourth district of the county, were kidnapped by bandits a few days ago, who demanded a ransom of 5,000 yuan for each. The Zheng and Li families asked Yang Hua and another person to go to Xiajiaji, the bandits' den in the tenth district, to negotiate. However, the bandits detained Yang because his family was relatively well-off. They instructed Yang to tell his family to prepare the ransom quickly.</p>
<p>Nantong Riverside Protection Funding Difficult to Raise</p>
<p>The Nantong riverbank has collapsed severely. Xu Ji, from the provincial committee, came to survey and design protection measures, estimating that building protective embankments would cost 600,000 yuan. Local land tax revenue is less than 100,000 yuan. The province allocated special funds, using the revenue from raising the Lu Tian tax as collateral, about 200,000 yuan. However, none of these funds are currently available. Local communities, considering the dangerous collapse near Langshan Port, which requires urgent action, requested the county government to allocate 2,000 yuan to carry out emergency rescue work.</p>
<p>Jiaxing Bandits Rob and Injure People</p>
<p>At the home of Gu Guilin, a farmer in Sanjia Village, Zhangyue Township, near the north gate of Jiaxing, more than ten bandits armed with wooden-cased guns and iron rulers broke into the house late at night on the 15th. They confined Gu's family in one room and ransacked the place. Gu Maotou, a neighbor, and his wife, Zhang, mistook them for thieves and opened their door to look. The bandits saw them, opened fire, and shot Zhang in the chest, killing her instantly. Gu Aqi was also held by the bandits, who struck his waist and legs several times with an iron ruler, causing severe injuries and preventing him from moving. After robbing the house, the bandits escaped by boat towards Guanjia Port.</p>

<p>Local News</p>
<p>Kong Xianrong, Deputy Commander of Wang Delin's Forces, Arrives in Shanghai</p>
<p>Expresses Gratitude on Behalf of Wang, Reports on Anti-Japanese Efforts</p>
<p>Kong Xianrong, Deputy Commander of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Army of Jilin Province, led by General Commander Wang Delin, arrived in Shanghai at 11 AM on the 15th aboard the Empress of Canada, accompanied by representative Liang Detang. A reporter from the Far East News Agency interviewed them yesterday. Kong Xianrong kindly agreed to be interviewed and provided details of the army's anti-Japanese efforts and current situation. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Situation Upon Arrival in Hong Kong</p>
<p>"After General Commander Wang and I returned to China via Russia and arrived in Hong Kong, I originally intended to come to Shanghai on the same ship. However, various public organizations there held grand welcoming ceremonies and repeatedly asked me to stay for banquets. Unable to refuse their warm hospitality, I had to stay a little longer to report on the war and the retreat from Russia."</p>
<p>Wang is Ill in Hong Kong</p>
<p>"Since arriving in Hong Kong, General Commander Wang has been suffering from a minor illness due to the long journey, which later developed into a stomach ailment. Moreover, General Commander Wang is naturally anxious and constantly worried about the national crisis. The families of his subordinates are living in Shanghai and have not yet been settled, adding to his anxieties. Therefore, his illness has not yet been cured."</p>
<p>Ordered to Express Gratitude</p>
<p>"My visit to Shanghai this time is at the specific request of General Commander Wang. Because people in Shanghai have been looking forward to his arrival for a long time, he feels very sorry that he cannot fulfill his promise to come to Shanghai due to illness. He also heard that grand welcoming ceremonies are being planned, which would consume a lot of resources while the national crisis is not yet resolved. He felt uneasy about this and specifically instructed me to come to Shanghai to express his gratitude to all sectors for their kindness. He also expressed that he would come to Shanghai in person as soon as he recovers from his illness. At that time, he hopes that there will be no publicity to avoid various extravagances."</p>
<p>Mission in Shanghai</p>
<p>"General Commander Wang entrusted me with three missions in Shanghai: 1. To express gratitude to all sectors on his behalf; 2. To address the issue of donations for ships; 3. To make proper arrangements for the generals and soldiers at the front. Since September 18th, all the soldiers have endured hardships, suffering from hunger and cold, and fighting for many years. Currently, Deputy Commander Wu is leading the brave soldiers and still fighting at the front. If no proper arrangements are made, the army will inevitably disintegrate. I cannot bear to leave them to fend for themselves."</p>
<p>Kong Xianrong's Aspirations for Resisting Japan (Presented by Far East News Agency)</p>
<p>"General Commander Wang, myself, and others share the same aspiration: to resist Japan and save the country. We only know that the country's survival means our family's survival, and the country's demise means our family's demise. We are determined to uphold the principle that everyone is responsible for the fate of the nation. We ignore any dissenting opinions and seek practical solutions without pursuing meaningless vanity."</p>
<p>Brief Account of Past Events</p>
<p>"Since September 18th, I have participated in the anti-Japanese effort, fighting alongside General Commander Wang at the front and recovering Ning'an County and other places. Later, due to the negligence of friendly forces in the defense of Ning'an, the city fell again. We launched a major counteroffensive, but the enemy used aircraft and artillery to bomb and encircle us on all sides. Fortunately, our soldiers fought bravely, engaging in several hand-to-hand combats, and finally broke through the encirclement. Both sides suffered heavy losses in this battle. Unable to continue, we were ordered to retreat to the Chinese Eastern Railway. We encountered a large number of enemy troops and fought fiercely for several hours, finally defeating the enemy. Our army marched to Xing'an Town to regroup and replenish. However, Ma Zhanshan's forces were defeated and retreated to Russia. The Japanese then launched a full-scale attack on our army from five directions. It was very cold at the time, and our army was lacking in supplies and suffering from hunger and cold. However, we were still determined to resist to the death. Eventually, we ran out of ammunition and were unable to hold out. We had to painfully retreat to Russian territory, arriving in Domuske on March 11th. The remaining troops were dispersed and hidden, waiting for an opportunity. Currently, our strength has not only not been diminished but has actually been expanded. With sufficient support, it will not be difficult to recover the lost territory and continue the anti-Japanese effort."</p>
<p>"Representative Liang and I will come to Shanghai first to prepare everything. Once General Commander Wang recovers from his illness and arrives in Shanghai, if there are no other delays, we will immediately rush to the front, lead our troops, continue the anti-Japanese effort, recover the lost territory, fulfill our long-cherished wish, and repay the people of our country."</p>
<p>Settlement of Crew Issues on the Tunan Ship</p>
<p>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Decides to Handle According to Law</p>
<p>After the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Tunan ship was sunk by the Changchun Maru, the head office held a meeting yesterday morning to decide on compensation for the crew members. They also inquired about the circumstances of the collision from the captain and chief mate in order to file a claim with the Dalian Steamship Company. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Ministry Orders Method</p>
<p>Liu Hongsheng, General Manager of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, immediately reported the sinking of the Tunan ship to the Ministry and requested instructions on how to compensate the crew members. The Ministry sent Gao Tingzi, Director of the Shipping Administration Department, to Shanghai to investigate thoroughly. After receiving a report from Captain Jiang Changqing the day before, he took the Shanghai-Nanjing overnight express train back to Beijing to report on the same evening. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company received instructions from the Ministry of Communications the day before, stating that compensation for the crew members who were killed or injured should be handled according to the law if there are relevant regulations. If there are no explicit regulations in the law, it should be handled according to past practices.</p>
<p>Request Compensation</p>
<p>At 9 AM yesterday morning, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's staff welfare association sent Li Ruigen and Ding Kangyong, heads of the stoker and cook departments, and Li Zaichen, head of general affairs, to request General Manager Liu Hongsheng to provide compensation to the crew members from the stoker, cook, and service departments who were killed or injured, in accordance with past practices. At the same time, the Marine Engineers' Association sent Feng Yuming to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to request compensation for the marine engineers who were killed or injured, in accordance with the law. Shen Yougeng, Business Director of the Tunan, contacted General Manager Liu at 9:30 AM to discuss the compensation for the cargo, hold, and other departments. General Manager Liu received all of them, agreed to submit the matter to the meeting at 10 AM for decision, and instructed them to attend the meeting for discussion together.</p>
<p>Decide on Settlement</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company held a meeting at 10 AM yesterday to specifically discuss the Tunan case. Those present were General Manager Liu Hongsheng, Secretary Qi Fuming, Head of the Shipping Department Zhao Yunhe, and Huang Xuchu. Those attending the meeting were Business Director Shen Yougeng, Li Ruigen and Ding Kangyong from the staff welfare association, and Feng Yuming from the Marine Engineers' Association. The meeting was chaired by the General Manager and recorded by Secretary Qi. First, the staff welfare association, the Marine Engineers' Association, and the Business Director stated their opinions on the request for compensation, and it was immediately resolved that: (1) For the four departments of the crew members who were killed or injured, including stokers, cooks, service personnel, and marine engineers, compensation should be made in accordance with Article 67 of the Maritime Law, which states, "Regardless of whether the crew member is paid monthly or per voyage, if they die during the term of employment, three months' salary will be added from the date of death. If death is caused by performing duties, one year's salary will be added from the date of death." (2) The crew members of the cargo and hold departments are all employed by the Business Director and should be handled by the Business Director. However, in consideration of the Business Director, the Bureau will pay the Business Director one year's salary, totaling 2,400 yuan. (3) The surviving crew members of the stoker, cook, service, and marine engineering departments, in addition to the maintenance fee already issued, will be issued one month's salary. The meeting adjourned at 11 AM.</p>
<p>Handle Negotiations</p>
<p>A reporter from the New Sound News Agency interviewed General Manager Liu Hongsheng yesterday. According to him, the Tunan ship broke apart and sank immediately after being hit violently, which took only four or five minutes, resulting in the drowning of crew members and passengers. It is a great pity. Now, they have received an order from the Ministry to handle the matter in accordance with the provisions of the Maritime Law. As for handling the negotiation matters, although Captain Jiang Changqing has reported, in order to clarify the facts, Head of the Shipping Department Zhao Yuntai and others have been separately interrogating Captain Jiang Changqing and Chief Mate Sun Zuoren. Once the interrogation is completed, they will file a claim with the Dalian Steamship Company.</p>
<p>Huge Sum of Money Salvaged</p>
<p>The thirty-nine boxes of silver bullion loaded by the Bank of Communications, some with 5,000 taels per box and some with 2,500 taels per box, have now been verified to be worth 160,000 yuan. The insurance company and the bank are working together to salvage it. In addition, the 79 bags of express letters, printed matter, and ordinary letters mailed by the Yantai Post Office, including important remittance orders and drafts, as well as official documents, are also planned to be salvaged.</p>
<p>Western Woman's Account</p>
<p>Reuters reported from Dalian on the 17th that Mrs. Herribak, the only foreign passenger on the Tunan, which was destroyed by the Japanese ship Changchun Maru, fell into the sea after the Tunan was hit. After ten hours of drifting, she was rescued by the Japanese ship Changchun Maru, but her knee was broken and she is currently being treated in a local hospital in Dalian. A Reuters reporter visited her and, according to her account, "I can't remember the circumstances of the injury. However, when the Tunan was hit, I was awakened from a dream. It was about 4 AM. I heard a loud crash. From the sound, I knew the ship had been hit. The Tunan sank very quickly. When I jumped into the sea, the water had reached the scuppers. At that time, I had no fear. I just hoped to leave the sinking ship as soon as possible, the farther the better, so I tried to swim. I tried to hold onto anything floating in the sea, but the wind and waves were too strong and I couldn't. Later, I grabbed a capsized lifeboat. At that time, I was probably unconscious, letting the waves carry me. Then I grabbed a wooden door floating on the sea, but it was washed away by the waves. When I was lying on the lifeboat, there was a Eurasian who also climbed onto the side of the boat, but he was soon washed away by the waves. Finally, the Tunan's drawbridge was blown over by the wind, and I and a Chinese youth climbed onto it. As for how I was injured, I can't remember, but I know that the struggle during the floating and sinking was as if I was helped by divine power."</p>
<p>It is reported that Mrs. Herribak is still being treated in a hospital in Dalian and will wait for her brother from Yantai to come before deciding what to do. Mrs. Herribak was on vacation to visit her brother in Yantai and then return to her country via Shanghai. Unexpectedly, she encountered this accident, which is very unfortunate.</p>
<p>Pay One Month's Salary</p>
<p>After the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company decided to issue one month's salary to the rescued crew members (stokers, cooks, service personnel, and marine engineers), the heads of each department received the funds from the accounting department and distributed them yesterday afternoon at 1 PM. The stoker and cook departments were distributed by Director Li Ruigen at the Jinliyuan Wharf Staff Welfare Association, the service department was distributed by Director Ding Kangyong at the Dahu Hotel, and the marine engineering department was distributed at the Marine Engineers' Association. However, the cargo and hold departments were not included because the bureau considered them to be crew members employed by the Business Director.</p>
<p>Shipping Associations</p>
<p>The Chinese Shipping Mutual Aid Association (i.e., the Business Directors' Association) invited relevant parties to hold a joint meeting at 3 PM yesterday. Those present were Shen Huating and others from the Shipping Mutual Aid Association, Fu Wenbin from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Cargo Handling Association, Lu Rongzhi from the Seamen's Branch, Shen Yougeng, Business Director of the Tunan, and Qi Fuming from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. First, Shen Yougeng reported on the settlement measures decided by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. Then, the meeting discussed and decided: (1) to request the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to promptly resolve the compensation and indemnity matters for the Tunan personnel who were killed or injured; (2) regarding the management of the crew members of various ships, according to the original management plan, the bureau should jointly deliberate with relevant groups to rectify the management methods, resolve outstanding issues, and implement them effectively.</p>
<p>Staff Welfare Association Expresses</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Staff Welfare Association requested that the compensation for the crew members of the stoker, cook, and service departments who were killed or injured be handled in accordance with the example of the Xinkang ship, with 500 yuan per person. Now, the bureau has decided to pay one year's salary in accordance with the Maritime Law, with the salaries of the three departments of crew members being about 34.8 yuan per month, giving a year's total of 417.6 yuan, which is 82.4 yuan less than 500 yuan. On the other hand, the salaries of the headmen, carpenters, and other crew members are about 42 yuan per month, giving a year's total of 504 yuan, which is 4 yuan more than 500 yuan. Therefore, it was decided to request the bureau to still handle the matter in accordance with the established precedent of 500 yuan. Otherwise, the Staff Welfare Association will make up the difference of 82.4 yuan per person. Director Li Ruigen has been sent to the chairman and vice-chairman Wang Xiaolai and Jin Tingsun to ask for instructions on how to handle the matter.</p>
<p>Seamen's Union</p>
<p>The Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Seamen's Union, in addition to being responsible for handling the aftermath of the Tunan case, has sent a telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to lodge a serious protest to achieve compensation for the losses and ensure that the same incident does not happen again in the future. It is learned that the surviving crew members of the ship and the headmen, service personnel, stokers, and other crew members of the cargo and hold departments have suffered heavy losses in this accident and have successively elected representatives to request relief from the union. In order to clarify the circumstances of the accident and thoroughly compile the amount of losses, the union will convene a meeting of representatives at 10 AM today (the 18th) at the Nanjun'an Public Association in the Xue Longdi Guoyutang Lane in the city to discuss the situation and coordinate the negotiations based on the reports of the representatives.</p>
<p>Marine Engineering Association</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Marine Engineers' Association convened a temporary executive committee meeting after the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Tunan ship was sunk by the Changchun Maru of the Dalian Steamship Company of Japan. The meeting resolved: (1) to submit a request to the Ministry of Communications to thoroughly investigate the issue of responsibility for the incident; (2) to send a telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to lodge a serious protest with the Japanese side; (3) to welcome members Huang Baocai, Kong Xingui, and the crew members and passengers who were rescued; (4) to send a letter to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to compensate the deceased crew members and provide relief to the rescued crew members; (5) to send a telegram to various organizations to unite and assist in the negotiations with the Japanese side. When the rescued crew members and passengers arrived in Shanghai the day before, the association sent representatives to the dock to welcome them. However, due to incorrect information about the dock and time, they did not achieve their goal. Therefore, today, the association's standing committee members Feng Yuming and Cai Yuzhang, committee members Mao Jinsheng and Huang Zugeng, and others will go to the homes of the rescued crew members and members Huang Baocai and Kong Xingui to express their condolences.</p>

<p>Results of Yesterday's Consultation on the Issue of Factory Inspection in the Concession</p>
<p>Agreement on Measures, Separate Instructions Sought from Authorities</p>
<p>The item for the main and deputy directors has been agreed to be cancelled.</p>
<p>After several consultations between Municipal Secretary-General Yu Hongjun and Municipal Council Director-General Fessenden on the factory inspection case in the Public Concession, opinions have gradually become closer. Yesterday afternoon, Yu and Fei met again, and both sides have agreed on the measures. In addition, the establishment of chief and deputy inspection directors in the previously proposed measures has been agreed to be cancelled. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Successful Consultation between Yu and Fei</p>
<p>Mr. Yu Hongjun visited Director-General Fessenden at the Municipal Council at 3 PM yesterday. The two talked for about half an hour, and both sides discussed the measures and reached an agreement. They agreed to report to their respective authorities for instructions. Mr. Yu reported to relevant departments in Nanjing, and Mr. Fei reported to the Board of Directors. The date of signing and implementation will be determined after both parties receive a reply. However, it is rumored that the signing date will be some time later.</p>
<p>Cancellation of Chief and Deputy Directors</p>
<p>The previous disclosure of the contents of the measures indicated the establishment of a chief and deputy director. Now, according to Mr. Yu's conversation yesterday, he said that this item had been agreed to be cancelled long ago. The inspectors are like police officers and have no actual administrative or executive power. The crackdown or correction of factories must be handled by the court. Moreover, if disputes arise among the inspectors, Yu (Mr. Yu) and Fei Xindun will guide them, so there is no need for a chief and deputy director. However, we will still maintain the majority of sovereignty over the number of inspectors.</p>
<p>Tianchu Factory Formally Requests Replacement of Aircraft</p>
<p>Zen Chen Chinese Manager Replies that Head Office Reply Has Not Arrived</p>
<p>Tianchu Factory Requests Replacement of Aircraft Based on Contract Facts</p>
<p>After the Tianchu aircraft was damaged during a test flight at Hongqiao Airport, the Tianchu Factory requested Zen Chen, the China agent of the Junkers Factory, to bear full responsibility and replace the aircraft with a new one based on the contract and the driver at the time of the accident. Yesterday noon, the Chinese manager of the firm replied to Tianchu Factory owner Wu Yun Chu, saying that he was waiting for a reply from the German head office. The Tianchu Factory then submitted the original contract again yesterday.</p>
<p>Original Text of Contract</p>
<p>The Tianchu Factory purchased the Junkers aircraft from the German merchant Zen Chen. The following is an excerpt from the original text of the contract related to the accident: "The test flight location is determined to be Hongqiao Airport. When the aircraft arrives in Shanghai, it should be test-flown by an approved aviator. The cost of the test flight shall be borne by the seller to prove the integrity of the aircraft itself." "After the test flight is completed, it is considered in fact that the aircraft has been delivered to the buyer, and then the seller's responsibility is completed."</p>
<p>Request to Replace Aircraft</p>
<p>Based on the original text of the contract, Tianchu believes that Zen Chen should bear the responsibility. It was originally planned to hold the test flight at the Jiangwan Racecourse, but Zen Chen did not agree. Limited by the contract, it was only possible to fly at Hongqiao. Second, the test flight that day was performed by a German technician hired by Zen Chen, and the aircraft had not yet been accepted by the Tianchu Factory. Therefore, this was Zen Chen's own aircraft test flight, so the firm should replace it with a new aircraft.</p>
<p>Chinese Manager's Reply</p>
<p>Zen Chen sent the Chinese manager to visit Mr. Wu Yun Chu of the Tianchu Factory at noon yesterday to reply to the question of aircraft replacement. It is said that the firm has not received a reply after sending a telegram to the German factory reporting the accident on the day of the accident. The request for aircraft replacement should be formally contacted by the Tianchu Factory with a letter. Finally, it was said that the test flight had been insured in advance, so the firm was also negotiating with the insurance company.</p>
<p>Formal Letter</p>
<p>According to the reply from the Chinese manager of Zen Chen, the Tianchu Factory formally sent a letter to the firm yesterday afternoon, requesting the replacement of the aircraft. The content is roughly as follows: On the 14th, a notice was received from Zen Chen reporting the test flight accident. A specialist was immediately asked to go for detailed inspection. According to the report, the damage was very serious and could not be repaired in a short period of time. Even if it is repaired in the future, it will inevitably lose its original effectiveness and will issue other dangers. Therefore, according to the facts of the contract, it is formally requested to replace the aircraft with a new one for delivery. The cost of all aircraft replacements will of course be borne by Zen Chen. This letter was sent out yesterday afternoon and is expected to be answered today.</p>
<p>Ningbo Aircraft Decided to Order Curtis Destroyer Aircraft</p>

Yu Qiaqing presided over the meeting, and Lin Mianzhai recorded the meeting. After the formalities, the three review committee members publicly elected by the previous committee, Mao Heyuan, Zhu Meixian, and Chen Songyuan, reported on the contract for ordering US aircraft from the Aviation Association. As a result of the review, the aircraft parts are precise, solid, and flexible, and the price is low and affordable. In addition, the US exchange rate has recently fallen, making it extremely low. It is an excellent opportunity for our Ningbo to purchase aircraft. Then the chairman proposed: (1) The aircraft purchased by the association was reviewed by the review committee for the 18 contracts for ordering US aircraft from the Aviation Association approved at the last committee meeting, and the report was submitted after the three review committee members completed the review. It should be voted on. Resolved, a letter will be sent to the Aviation Association Wu Chief of Staff Tiecheng to purchase a US "Curtis Flying Eagle" destroyer aircraft from the association, according to the contract, each unit is priced at US$22,227. It was publicly promoted that Committee Member Xu Maotang will purchase the US dollars in full from the bank first tomorrow. The funds will be delivered at the naming ceremony to be held on schedule, and it is planned to name the aircraft "Ningbo".</p>

<p>To Whom It May Concern:</p>

<p>To Whom It May Concern:</p>
<p>I found that on the 14th of this month, your newspaper published an article about the serious power plant workers' strike, in which I was nominated as a representative. After reading it, I was puzzled. Since I had not been consulted for my consent in advance, and had not received any notification of this matter, it was rash to publish it, which seems to be inconsistent with the procedures. Moreover, I have repeatedly stated in the past that if the workers in this factory have any difficulties, I can help them to report to the factory, but I absolutely deny any representative title. I am afraid that the truth is unclear and misunderstandings may occur, so I hereby write to deny it. Please correct it.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Anhui Province Destroys Education Department, Executive Yuan Orders Strict Punishment</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 17th) Due to the college entrance examination disturbance in Anhui Province, the provincial government decided to dismiss the principals of the two schools involved, the High School and the First High School. After the department order was issued, on the morning of the 15th, more than 60 teachers and staff members of the two schools, led by hooligans, swarmed into the department, claiming to see the director, broke into the director's office, destroyed the windows and appliances, and beat and insulted the director and several staff members. The director fled to the provincial government, and the teachers and staff members chased after him, scolding at will. It is now heard that the provincial government has ordered the Public Security Bureau to arrest the ringleaders Xie Hongsheng and others for strict punishment. It is found that since the Anhui strike incident, Jiang had telegraphed the Chairman, ordering Education Director Yang to seriously rectify the situation. After receiving the report of the destruction of the Education Department by teachers and staff members on the 17th, the Executive Yuan immediately telegraphed Chairman Ma, stating that the morals of the education sector in Anhui Province have always been uneven, and the academic performance of students is also very ordinary. This time, a small number of principals and teachers openly opposed the examination and destroyed the examination hall, and now they have beaten and injured the director and staff members of the Education Department because of the dismissal of the principals, to the point where law and discipline are completely lost. It is hoped that a thorough investigation and legal punishment will be carried out to punish the vicious and uphold law and discipline.</p>
<p>(Anqing, 16th) The provincial government has decided to severely punish the teachers and staff members of the High School and the First High School for destroying the Education Department.

<p>Fujian Education Department Implements New Regulations Set by the Ministry</p>
<p>Reorganize the School System, Implement Full-Time Teachers, Implement Integrated Training and Education (Fuzhou Dispatch) The Ministry of Education issued a clear order in April regarding the school laws and regulations for primary and secondary schools, normal schools, and vocational schools, and ordered all provinces to implement them on August 1. After receiving the order, the Fujian Education Department immediately organized a New Regulations Planning Committee to discuss the implementation steps and decided on: (1) Reorganize the School Law, regarding the first item, which has been recorded in previous reports. Now, the second and third items are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>Implement Full-Time Teachers (1) Schools that have been newly reorganized should be handled in accordance with the new regulations starting in 1933. For example, Xiamen Vocational School, Fuzhou Agricultural Vocational School, Yongchun Junior High School, Nanping Junior High School, etc., the number of full-time and part-time teachers and staff that should be established should be implemented immediately in accordance with the new regulations. (2) For schools that have not been reorganized, the department should compare the number of grades in each school with the regulations and determine the number of full-time and part-time teachers and staff that the school should establish, and inform each school. After receiving the order, each school should reduce the number of part-time teachers and increase the number of full-time teachers as much as possible, so that the decision is in line with the regulations. If it is impossible to do so temporarily due to factual reasons, the number of part-time teachers and staff that are exceeded should be reduced by at least one-half in this year. (3) All full-time teachers may not hold any position outside the school. (4) All full-time and part-time teachers should guide students' self-study.</p>
<p>Implement Integrated Training and Education (1) There is no need to set up special training instructors. Training instructors should be兼辦by full-time teachers to promote the integration of training and education. All full-time teachers who also serve as directors and training instructors may appropriately reduce their weekly teaching hours, but may not be less than two-thirds of the minimum limit, and may not receive additional pay. (2) The principal's teaching time should not be less than one-half of the minimum teaching time for full-time teachers, but schools with more grades and more complicated affairs may request a reduction at their discretion. (3) All직敎teachers in provincial middle schools who are over sixty years old and have served continuously for more than fifteen years, if they request retirement or are asked to retire by the school in accordance with Article 1 of the School직敎Teacher Retirement Annuity Regulations promulgated by the National Government, may be issued a retirement annuity by the department after approval by the provincial government, and be hired by the school as honorary tutors for students' extracurricular activities, using their special expertise to guide students' extracurricular free research. (4) The school principal should issue a detailed resume of qualified personnel for each middle school teacher in the province and submit it directly to the Education Department for approval. After the approval, the school will prepare an appointment letter and send it to the hired teacher.</p>
<p>Record of the Opening of the Annual Meeting of the Chinese Agricultural Society</p>
<p>The Chinese Agricultural Society is a well-known academic organization in the country, with members all over the country and abroad. It is customary to hold an annual meeting once a year. This year's annual meeting is being held at the Suzhou Agricultural School. Member registration began on the 15th of this month, and the formal meeting officially opened today. The opening ceremony was held at 8:00 AM, with members from Beiping, Hunan, Hubei, Guangdong, and nearby areas such as Jiangsu, Anhui, Zhejiang, and the Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou area, totaling more than 90 people, as well as Shen Pengfei, a representative of the Ministry of Education, Zhang Zongcheng, a representative of the Ministry of Industry, representatives of the Central Agricultural Experimental Institute and other agricultural and forestry agencies, guests, and news reporters. The meeting was presided over by Zou Shuwen, vice chairman of the society, who led the ceremony. He then reported on the society's affairs and the preparations for the annual meeting. Next, Zhang Zongcheng, the representative of the Ministry of Industry, delivered a speech, mainly stating that the rural economy in the country is bankrupt, agricultural production is low, and the whole country is suffering from severe anemia. He hoped that the members would use their expertise to prescribe a good remedy and save it. Next, Shen Pengfei, the representative of the Ministry of Education, delivered a speech, mainly stating that there are three situations in the country that deserve everyone's attention: (A) The backwardness of science, agriculture, industry, etc., has not achieved anything, and there is no way to make international scholars and the scientific community pay attention. (B) The bankruptcy of the rural economy, frequent disasters, and the disaster of 共匪 in various places have fundamentally destroyed the rural land system, which urgently needs research, remedy, and reorganization. (C) In the past, agricultural education has been criticized harshly by the outside world. Agricultural school students lack practical skills and cannot engage in practical work. We must find ways to improve so that we can remedy this shortcoming. The above three points are all hoped that the members will discuss at length, and the Ministry of Education, which is in charge of educational administration, is more willing to learn from them. Next, Peng Jiayuan, a professor at Guangdong Zhongshan University, reported on the agricultural administration, education facilities, and actual agricultural situation in Guangdong Province in detail. Agricultural education institutions and administrative institutions are linked to each other. The former focuses on teaching and research, and the latter focuses on promotion. In addition, there is a soil survey institute responsible for investigating the soil conditions in various counties, as well as the fundamental basis for improving agriculture. It is said that the survey work has been completed in five counties. Next, Zou Tianhe, director of the Central Agricultural Experimental Institute, delivered a speech, hoping that all members would uphold the same great purpose of improving Chinese agriculture, contribute their efforts, and work together, so that there is no fear of not achieving significant results. Next, Liu Bailiang, dean of the Agricultural College of Beiping University, delivered a speech, stating that (A) the scope of the current agricultural administrative agency is very small, and it is extremely difficult to develop its business. For example, the entire staff of the Agricultural Department of the Ministry of Industry is not as large as one department of the General Affairs Department of the same ministry. Moreover, the current so-called Rural Reconstruction Committee has very few professionals, and the organization is unsound, so it is difficult to expect success. (B) In terms of agricultural education, although the central government is now paying attention to it, universities are proposing to add agricultural colleges, but in the current situation, there is an extreme shortage of agricultural professors and talents, and agricultural graduates cannot be used by society. If we continue to increase the establishment of agricultural colleges in this way, it will only increase the difficulty and will not contribute much to agricultural science and agriculture. Therefore, it is necessary to actively enrich the content of the existing agricultural colleges and make them sound. (C) The current task of the Agricultural Society is still lacking in achievements. However, in addition to this society, there are also the New China Agricultural Society and the China Agricultural Society in the country with the same nature of agricultural academic organizations. I think that we should merge into the China Agricultural Society, cooperate fully, and increase the strength of the agricultural community. Next, Liao Jianan, the principal of Suzhou Agricultural School, reported on the main points of preparing for the meeting and apologized for the inadequate reception. Finally, the chairman answered and dismissed the meeting. It is heard that a memorial service for the society's member Fei Shiyu, who was a well-known entomologist in the country, will be held immediately. Before his death, Fei君遗嘱that he would allocate funds to establish the society's scholarship fund. The formal meeting will be held in the afternoon, with papers to be read, society affairs to be reported, and agricultural issues to be discussed, including (1) rural financial relief issues, (2) rural sideline issues, (3) rural land issues, and (4) other various important rural issues. Tomorrow, we will visit various agricultural agencies and tour scenic spots.</p>

<p>Recent News from Fujian College</p>
<p>The private Fujian College was established only four years ago. The president is He Gonggan. The college has a law department, an agriculture department, and an attached middle school. The law department just graduated its first class this summer. The agriculture department is preparing and has some clues. It was originally scheduled to recruit agriculture students after the summer vacation, but it was suspended due to disturbances. This disturbance was caused by the re-election of the president. The predecessor of the college was the private Fujian Law and Politics Specialized School. Since the Republic of China 16, it has been in decline, its management has been corrupt, and it has been criticized as a correspondence school. In the Republic of China 18, it was renamed Fujian College, with He as the president, and it was greatly reorganized. The law department and the college were separated and a separate board of directors was established. The directors are Yang Shuzhuang, Chen Peikun, Peng Yihu, Liu Chonglun, Liu Tong, Huang Wan, Zheng Zhenwen, He Gonggan, Liu Yicheng, Ye Guomou, Yang Zhulin, Tian Min, and Shi Jialin, a total of thirteen people. The Ministry approved the establishment in November 19. In July 21, the college was also approved by the Ministry. In addition to the law department, an agriculture department was added, and the Ministry ordered the private law school to stop recruiting new students. The last group of students graduated this summer. In fact, the private law school has been completely eliminated. Since He became president of the college, he has hired new professors, purchased land, and built new middle school buildings and libraries, sparing no effort to promote the development of the college. He has also cooperated with the old people of the law school. So far, the directors and professors of the law and political science departments of the college are all from the old law school.</p>

<p>On Talking and Cursing  I</p>
<p>Just seeing this rather vulgar topic, some people will inevitably curse me as a 胡調 (nonsensical) friend with despicable character. However, this is just cursing, and I can't be bothered with it. Even the most virtuous sages and heroes are sometimes cursed, let alone a morally deficient fellow like me.</p>
<p>However, cursing is, after all, a real phenomenon in society. The curser feels pleased, and the cursed feels angry. It seems that if there were no cursing, the world would not be at peace. The reason it is so peaceful now is precisely because cursers don't pay attention to the art of cursing, so the cursed don't feel pain or itching, as if they weren't cursed at all. So, what I want to discuss now is how to curse effectively. This is beneficial to the world and people's hearts, and enough to increase personal virtue.</p>
<p>The most venomous curse in Japanese is "馬鹿野郎" (Bakayaro), with "畜生" (Chikushō) coming in second. The direct translation of "馬鹿野郎" should be "idiot," while the meaning of "畜生" is quite clear. Compared to us Chinese, naturally, calling someone "畜生" implies they are no longer human, making it even more unbearable than being called an "idiot." However, the Japanese do the opposite, which is perplexing. I'm not very clear on the most venomous words in Western languages, but terms like "Foolish fellow" or "Bad man" don't seem to be the most unbearable words in the Chinese dictionary. However, the English phrase "You are no gentleman" is quite humorous. However, this kind of refined language is not favored by Chinese people. But Chinese people's cursing is really powerful. Aside from the extremely common "X 娘," it's basically cursing from your wife or younger sister all the way up to your ancestors for three generations. Even grandmothers who have been dead for hundreds of years are not spared. As for "idiot," "畜生," and "bad egg," they are only used in jest. Saying "You are not a gentleman" doesn't fit the Chinese tone at all. Originally, Chinese people have always considered matters of sex to be a great shame. Although the curser may not necessarily have had sexual relations with the cursed's woman, it is always considered sacred and inviolable, even more so than "泰山石敢當" (a stone tablet used to ward off evil). As for the Shanghai phrases "赤佬" (Chilao) or "猪玀" (Zhuluo), they barely count as cursing, just a kind of verbal tic.</p>
<p>However, simply shouting abuse like that is quite ordinary and harms the gentlemanly demeanor, making it unsuitable for comrades in long gowns. Moreover, even if you shout abuse at his ancestors, at most you'll only make him understand that you're cursing him. He can also shout back loudly, the same way you cursed. Therefore, those who are good at cursing must curse in a way that makes others blush, be at a loss whether to laugh or cry. For example, when the scabby-headed Ah Q walked near the rice shop, just hearing someone say "The light bulb is on" made him feel pain in his heart, and the white scars on his head turned red. This kind of cursing is most effective. If you see Zheng Kaoxu or Hao Peng, etc., you absolutely cannot call them traitors, as you will suffer under their authority. On the contrary, you can compliment them by saying: "Brother, you've been making a fortune lately! China is really amazing, thanks to your efforts. Hahaha!" In this way, not only will they not be embarrassed and angry, but they will also have to cup their fists and pretend to smile, saying, "You flatter me!" However, in their hearts, they will feel indescribably uncomfortable. Another example is when George Bernard Shaw was pestered by a beautiful actress, who said, "If I married you, and our child looked like me but had your brains, wouldn't that be wonderful?" Who knew that Shaw would reply, "Indeed, but what if, unfortunately, the brains were like yours and the looks were like mine? That would be terrible." This kind of cursing is naturally extremely venomous, but unfortunately, it cannot be popularized.</p>
<p>She Failed!  Jie Xin</p>
<p>L is a classmate who has been my closest friend since childhood. She has extraordinary thoughts, a calm mind, a broad mind, and a burning passion. She is truly a promising young person! This semester I dropped out of school and worked in education, and she also left school with me. She works in an office at a company. Although we are separated, in our spare time, we always happily gather to talk or discuss some problems.</p>
<p>Because her thoughts are advanced and untainted, she treats everyone with a frank and upright attitude, and with pure and flawless enthusiasm. Of course, she could not make an exception to her colleagues. However, unexpected things unfolded and attacked her forcefully, and now her heart is completely scarred. She is sad, she is crying!</p>
<p>The fact is this.</p>
<p>"Madam: Please don't misunderstand me, and please understand my plight! Originally, our friendship was just that of friends who exchanged learning, and I felt this attitude was appropriate. But this frank action, this bright behavior, has been criticized and slandered by nervous people. Foolish as I am, I wouldn't have cared, but indirectly implicating you is what I least wanted! So from now on, I should keep my mouth shut to avoid unexpected troubles and feel exceptionally refreshed. Madam, this is not like avoiding food for fear of choking. Nor do I admit that it is the silence of the weak. But for you, I am indeed the self-restraint of the strong! The wording is presumptuous, please forgive me. Yours truly."</p>
<p>Her heart was filled with sorrow, and a bitter smile appeared on her face; I was at a loss after reading this letter. I asked her where this came from? She then told me: "This colleague who wrote the letter to me has a similar environment and thoughts to myself. So in ordinary conversations, we felt very compatible and harmonious, so we couldn't help but say a little more. Who would have thought that this unexpected attack would hit us head-on like this, Jie? Think about it! How scarred must my heart be? Now I am at a crossroads... Should I continue to struggle forward? Or should I succumb to the terrible environment as Mr. A said?"</p>
<p>Ms. L refused to defend the superficial concept of chastity and the remnants of feudal consciousness. But she failed. She just left the thatched cottage and embarked on the social journey, and society gave her such a powerful attack. Isn't this too cruel and merciless? Alas! I am sure that a woman with pure thoughts is definitely not a bottle of nitric acid, but some shallow and empty-headed young men with the narrow perspective of frogs in a well actually treat women like this, and boast about it with relish, unaware of their own pathetic state. They really are shameless things! How is it possible to rely on such things to seek happiness for the country and society?</p>
<p>An Enrollment Advertisement Full of Official Air  Chang</p>
<p>After being immersed in the city for five years, I suddenly got the opportunity to return to my hometown. What a happy thing this is!</p>
<p>After I put my swollen feet on my native soil, the first thing I wanted to know was naturally the level of educational development in my hometown. How fortunate! Without me having to investigate, there was an enrollment advertisement full of official air, very clearly displayed before my eyes. I read it from beginning to end and knew that the education in my hometown had indeed reached its full heyday, encompassing the past and the present. Now I will reprint it once without changing a word as a voluntary advertisement, which can also be regarded as expressing my enthusiasm for supporting it.</p>
<p>"According to the establishment of this school, it was originally intended to cultivate talent. There is no intention to make a profit, and even less to mislead people. The principal was formerly a government-supported student, worth boasting about his deep moral learning. The teachers graduated from middle school, and are proficient in all kinds of subjects. Handicraft, singing, and drawing, arithmetic multiplication and division, the Great Learning, the Doctrine of the Mean, and the Analects must all be strictly memorized. Tuition fees are reduced by half, each class costs three silver dollars. Incense and candles on the first and fifteenth of the lunar month are free, to show special treatment. For the sake of strictness and diligence, there are no holidays. Maintaining social customs comes first, and boys and girls are in separate classes. Students arrive at school at eight o'clock and only return at five in the afternoon. With so much teaching and reading, it can be called a new start. The school building is conveniently located for transportation, and the classroom doors and windows face south. The school staff is attentive, and tea is available all day long. The latrine pit is nearby, and there are two pairs of urinals. Those who live far away can be subsidized for meals, one meat and one vegetarian dish. If young children need to be picked up and dropped off, the school can also arrange it. Such a large scale shows a glimpse of the hard work. Let the whole town know, parents, why not come!"</p>

<p>Modern Celebrities' Calligraphy and Painting XIV: Min Jifang's Freehand Painting (Brief Biography) Min Fuwang, courtesy name Jifang, had innate intelligence, and an even deeper understanding of calligraphy and painting. Liu Weilin of Jiangxi saw his calligraphy and said, "He can learn painting." So he apprenticed to him, and in a few months, he became quite accomplished, especially capable of distinguishing the origins of changes in painting since the Song and Yuan dynasties. The teacher valued him even more. Whenever he finished a painting, his peers would applaud, but he alone lowered his head before Mr. Feng Chaoran's painting, considering it the closest to ancient times, and so he apprenticed to him again. Some say his painting is elegant, truly resembling his ancestor, the Eight-Fingered Gentleman.</p>
<p>Contributing Some Opinions on Summer Life  Ba Ling</p>
<p>The wheels of time are flying by, and summer vacation, the summer vacation of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, has arrived in the blink of an eye. During this hot summer, schools have all unanimously started their summer vacations. The duration is as short as fifty days, and some even extend to two or three months or more! Ah! What an ample leisure time this is!</p>
<p>Is summer vacation a time for us to rest? Is it a time for us to sit idle and do nothing? This may be possible in countries with national prosperity and people's well-being, but wasting this precious time is also uneconomical. What's more! Our China, a troubled and critical China! Therefore, we believe that our young students should not waste this precious summer vacation time, but should use this time to do things that are beneficial to themselves, beneficial to their families, and beneficial to society and the country. This is the motivation for the author to write this article "Contributing Some Opinions on Summer Life."</p>
<p>I believe that during the ample summer vacation time, we should:</p>
<p>(1) Cultivate Diligent Skills: Nowadays, everyone thinks that schools are extremely aristocratic! When young people go from home to school, there are people to sweep the floor, fold the quilt, and run errands. They don't have to do anything themselves. Thus, day after day, male students develop the airs of young masters, and female students develop the airs of young ladies. Everything is done by others, and they are unwilling to work themselves. Is this reasonable? Therefore, we should use this summer vacation to sweep and clean things in the home in the morning, and help our parents with manual labor. In this way, on the one hand, we cultivate our own habit of diligence and spirit of enduring hardship, and on the other hand, we can give our tired fathers, brothers, mothers, and sisters a good impression and indirectly provide mental comfort.</p>
<p>(2) Publicize the Situation of National Crisis: We believe that in this critical era of national crisis, saving the country is the responsibility of everyone. But saving the country requires most of the people to awaken in order to generate great power. Young people are the pillars of the country and the vanguard of society, and bear a heavier responsibility for saving the country than other people. Therefore, each of us young people should use this long summer vacation to go to the countryside or our own families and clearly tell the general public about the current situation of the country, the situation in the Northeast, the establishment of [illegible], and Japan's aggressive ambitions. So that every member of the public who comes into contact with me can understand the situation of the national crisis. If every young person can do this, I believe that the flame of revolution will naturally ignite among the masses, and increase the great power of national struggle.</p>
<p>(3) Organize Academic Discussion Groups: We believe that academic advancement is infinite. Our knowledge, strictly estimated, is truly like a grain of millet in the vast sea, a grain of sand in the desert. Therefore, we cannot be arrogant or complacent, but should be new every day, and make my knowledge increase day by day, so that students with similar distances can agree to meet at a certain time every day, everyone gathers in a quiet and beautiful place, and discuss academic problems together. Whoever is specialized in a certain subject will be my tutor in that subject. Everyone uses their own strengths to supplement the subjects that others lack. Doing this every day during a summer vacation, our knowledge can increase a lot imperceptibly. This is truly a beneficial and worthwhile thing to do.</p>
<p>The above three items are my small contributions to the work of young people during the summer vacation. Whether they are correct or not, I must ask the readers for corrections.</p>

<p>In the darkness, their uninterested conversation continued;</p>
<p>"What's really on your mind? What's the big deal about telling me?"</p>
<p>"I, I'm just thinking about you."</p>
<p>"Thinking about what? Tell me."</p>
<p>"Um..." The man found it difficult to say, changed his tone, but still didn't lose his original intention, just beat around the bush: "I'm just wondering if you really love me?"</p>
<p>"How could I not? I really love you!"</p>
<p>"It's just that I..." The man couldn't say it again, had to turn to his side, using his back to touch her breasts. Then he added very awkwardly: "It's just that I'm poor, I can't make you happy."</p>
<p>What she hated was not Shi Qiao's poverty, but Shi Qiao's lack of liveliness, lack of energy, lack of stirring her interest! But Shi Qiao's meaning was not afraid that he himself didn't have money to spend on the Third Concubine, it was that he really suddenly determined to shamelessly confess:</p>
<p>"I'm even having problems eating!"</p>
<p>"Really!" The woman exclaimed enthusiastically. Then asked coldly: "Then you're too silly, the other night, what Jie Fu said about patriotic groups taking advantage of public opportunities to extort merchants was hinting to ask you to help him? He now has a XX coal business being investigated! That night, you gave him a cold reply, and your friend surnamed Wang understood, yesterday Jie Fu already sent some money to Wang Xingkuang?"</p>
<p>"Really!" This was Li Shiqiao exclaiming, he was not jealous of seeing profit, he hated Wang the Dwarf's base personality even more.</p>
<p>"If it's not true, is it false? This money was originally yours to buy! You, you're too silly. But it doesn't matter, later I can always make a detour to Jie Fu, he always says he's afraid you don't have experience and leak the news!"</p>
<p>"Ah! Ah!" Shi Qiao forgot everything he had just wanted to say. At this time, he would rather not have food than beg the Third Concubine [illegible]. However, he turned again and tightly embraced the Third Concubine, this kind of embrace was [illegible]. Almost a [illegible] of flesh [illegible] all kinds of revenge!"</p>

<h3>Liu Zhenhua, Commander-in-Chief of the Border Regions, Suppresses the Communist Bandits</h3>
<p>Determining Post-War Measures for Communist Bandits</p>
<p>Xu Yuanquan Given a Deadline to Recover the Five Cranes</p>
<p>Hubei Southern Bandit Suppression Troops Advance Towards the Jiangxi Border</p>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: Liu Zhenhua, Commander-in-Chief of the Bandit Suppression in the Henan-Hubei-Anhui Border Region, after going to Huangchuan, actively made military deployments. Because the bandit forces are elusive, he adopted a steady and secure strategy, strengthening defenses and clearing the fields, encircling step by step. Currently, the divisions of Liu Maoen, Wan Yaohuang, Peng Zhenshan, Liang Guanying, Dai Minquan, Song Tiancai, Shangguan Yunxiang, Hao Mengling, and Tang Enbo have all been completely concentrated. Sun Lianzhong's division has also been ordered to go to assist. A large-scale advance and suppression is underway against the main force of the communist bandits. Liu believes that the post-war management of the communist areas is extremely important, and he has established a Post-War Committee, deciding to make the first step of work to be the rescuing of refugees and prisoners of war and the distribution of emergency relief. Then, industrial relief through work and transformation through relocation will be undertaken. "A" Rescue Measures: (1) In order to provide relief to refugees and facilitate military operations, temporary shelters will be established along the roads during the national army's advance and suppression, divided into two types: refugee shelters and prisoner of war shelters. (2) The routing of the shelters will be based on the routing of the military advance and suppression. (2) The following refugees must enter the shelters: 1. Those who fled from the communist areas; 2. Those who fled to avoid the dangers of the front lines; (3) Residents of villages under the front lines who hinder military operations and are ordered by the front-line commanders to move out; 4. Residents of recovered villages who are deemed necessary to be sheltered. (4) The location of each route's shelter should be in a suitable place in the rear of the war zone, marked as a refugee or prisoner of war shelter. (5) Men and women over the age of fourteen sheltered in the shelter shall live separately. (6) The order of each route's shelter will be based on the order in which they are reported. (7) Prisoners of war sheltered in the shelter will be transferred to the military law office first, and handled separately according to the severity of the circumstances. (8) Refugees sheltered in the shelter will be interrogated by personnel dispatched by the Party and government offices (handled according to the severity of the circumstances, according to the measures below: 1. Those who have held positions in the communist bandits or participated in the war and have taken actions that are indeed detrimental to the national army will be interrogated and handed over to the military law office for handling. 2. Those who are suspected of being communist bandits in the communist areas will be interrogated and sent to the industrial relief office or the transformation institute. 3. Those who are indeed farmers with families and have no suspicion of being attached to the communist bandits and have reliable guarantors will be issued a certificate of good citizenship and ordered to return home to live and work in peace. (9) Each shelter on each route will have one director and several staff members. (10) If the number of refugees or prisoners of war in each shelter exceeds 500, a branch shelter may be established at its discretion. (11) Food will be issued at a rate of 15 cents per person per day, half for children. (12) Each route's shelter will be monitored by teams dispatched by the bandit suppression troops on each route. (B) Emergency Relief Measures: (1) Prisoners of war and refugees in military passing areas will be registered by name and given emergency relief before entering the shelter. (2) Emergency relief will be issued at a rate of 15 cents per person per day, half for children. (3) Relief chiefs and relief workers will be assigned to each route to carry relief funds and handle emergency relief matters with the army. (4) The routing of emergency relief will be based on the routing of the military advance and suppression. One relief chief and several relief workers will be assigned to each route. (5) Charitable organizations coming to the communist areas to provide relief will have their relief locations designated by the Post-War Committee, and personnel will be assigned as guides. (6) When providing emergency relief, teams will be dispatched by the bandit suppression troops on each route to maintain order. (7) The deadline for emergency relief will be the day the bandit suppression ends, but it may be shortened or extended depending on the circumstances. Currently, the Henan Provincial Government has allocated 25,000 yuan, the Hubei Provincial Government has allocated 20,000 yuan, and the Anhui Provincial Government has allocated 30,000 yuan, and they have dispatched personnel separately. At this time when military and political measures are being taken simultaneously, the Cheng Daorong Regiment of Song Tiancai's 75th Division of the bandit suppression army suddenly mutinied. The regiment was originally incorporated from communist bandits and wanted to plot wrongdoing when the national army took action. The regimental adjutant and battalion commander were killed. Cheng led the mutinous troops and fled northwest towards Shangcheng. This happened on the 5th of this month. Song happened to be in Hankou and rushed to the scene upon hearing the news. He sent troops to pursue and suppress them. Dozens of people have been captured and executed on the spot, and more than 100 guns have been intercepted. The rest are still being pursued and suppressed and are not a cause for concern.</p>
<p>The He bandits in western Hubei are still in the Five Cranes Mountains. After Xu Yuanquan took office, he immediately began to advance and suppress them. Xu has given a deadline to recover the Five Cranes and strike directly at the bandit's nest. At the same time, he telegraphed the provincial government, saying that the bandit suppression troops had already been dispatched separately. If relief is not provided immediately, it will be difficult to stabilize the people in the recovered bandit areas. He proposed to quickly allocate large sums of money for relief in order to achieve the effect of military and political cooperation.</p>
<p>The Kong bandits in southern Hubei have now retreated to the Jiangxi border. He Jian, Commander-in-Chief of the bandit suppression in the western route, is responsible for handling the suppression. He convened a military conference in Changsha on the 10th and, after deciding on the strategy, the generals returned to their respective defenses. During the meeting, the troops in southern Hubei were reorganized. In general, the headquarters of the Third Column advanced to Xiushui, Jiangxi. Commander Chen Jicheng and Deputy Commander Guo Runan led their troops from Yangxin. The defense of Yangxin was taken over by the Rong Jingfang Division, which was originally stationed in Jinniu, while the Li Zongjian's New Seventh Brigade was moved to Jinniu, the Li Dingwu's Provisional Third Brigade was moved to Daye, and the Xie Bin's troops remained stationed in Chongyang Tongshan. With the deployment of each route being strict, it will be difficult for this remnant bandit force to flee into Hubei again. (14th)</p>
<h3>Jiangsong Training Institute's Lingering Excitement</h3>
<p>The Tax Police Training Institute held its fifth graduation ceremony for its students yesterday (16th). Starting at 7 p.m., the students performed lantern exercises, martial arts, wrestling, and other skills for entertainment. Representatives from various agencies attended the grand event. When the lantern exercises were completed and martial arts began, a man of about thirty years old, wearing short clothes and barefoot, stood on the stage. At that time, Director Yao, fearing that the stage was heavily loaded, ordered him to leave to prevent danger and warned him repeatedly. Not only did the man not comply, but he also debated loudly in public, arguing back. Yao ordered him to leave the stage again, but the man did not show any weakness and made a gesture of attacking. Yao's guards then shot him in the leg, causing a slight injury. He is currently being treated at the institute and is expected to recover soon.</p>
<h3>Party Department Holds Flood Prevention Propaganda</h3>
<p>The County Executive Committee followed the provincial order to hold a Flood Prevention Propaganda Week and decided on the methods and dates at the 50th meeting. The Propaganda Week will be held for seven days starting on the 17th. On the first day, a special propaganda issue will be ordered from the Songjiang Public Daily. On the second day, leaflets and slogans will be posted in various districts. On the third day, propaganda will be carried out at various entertainment venues. On the fourth day, a discussion meeting will be held with the township chiefs of the coastal towns in the 15th district. On the fifth day, a discussion meeting will be held with the township chiefs of the 16th district. On the sixth and seventh days, personnel will be dispatched to inspect the seawalls from Zhalin to Jinshanwei with technical personnel from the county government, and propaganda will also be carried out. Tang Shanyuan has been assigned to preside over the liaison separately.</p>
<h3>Further News on the Strike in Luoshe Town, Wuxi</h3>
<p>In Luoshe Town in this county, the Public Security Bureau sent police to arrest gamblers, which led to a strike. The situation has already been recorded in this newspaper. It is now known that County Commissioner Zhou Shaoji has submitted the investigation situation to the county government yesterday. The content is divided into four points and is generally the same as reported in the newspaper. Local representatives of the township, Yang Zhaogui and others, also gathered yesterday and decided to wait quietly for the county magistrate to thoroughly investigate and handle the matter, and to send telegrams on behalf of the Executive Yuan, the Control Yuan, the Ministry of the Interior, the Provincial Government, the Department of Civil Affairs, the Provincial Party Department, and the Second District Commissioner's Office to request that Wu Dexin, the director of the County Public Security Bureau, be dismissed from his post and investigated. Yan Shenyu, the county magistrate of this county, gave a responsible talk to reporters from the Xishan News Agency yesterday regarding this matter. He said that the truth of the matter has been clarified from various investigations, and the solution will be announced separately. As for my (the county magistrate's self-proclaimed) intentions, the following can be stated at present: (1) This strike is related to the previous case of resisting arrest when the Public Security Bureau arrested gamblers in Luoshe. For the sake of the government and the local area, I have a need to thoroughly investigate and punish the matter strictly. (2) Although this arrest of gamblers is related to the previous resistance to arrest, it should not involve any suspicion of personal retaliation. However, if the director's warrant is specifically for arresting gamblers, then gamblers can be arrested. If the executing police officers go beyond this scope, it is not only rash but also beyond the scope of their duties. (3) It is necessary to investigate separately whether the Chamber of Commerce's actions on that day were only to maintain order or whether they led to misunderstandings. If the police officers did have excessive behavior, they could request the government to handle the matter according to proper procedures. If they take direct action on their own, it will only increase the dispute. The government has already found considerable clues on the above three points and will naturally be able to find a proper way to resolve the matter. It is also heard that the town's businesses will formally file judicial and administrative lawsuits separately regarding this case, and they plan to send representatives to the Changzhou Commissioner's Office to petition.</p>
<h3>Robbers Arrested on the Spot After Continuous Robberies</h3>
<p>In the Tiandengtou area, which is about three miles away from Qianqiao in the Fourth District (Kaiyuan Township) of the county, the families of Tang Panquan, Tang Jitong, Tang Jigao, Tang Pansheng, and others were robbed one after another by eight robbers wearing short clothes and speaking with a Changzhou accent at about 11 p.m. on the night before last (16th). Tang Pansheng and Tang Jigao woke up upon hearing the alarm and rushed to report to the First Police Station of the Ninth Branch of the Public Security Bureau. Inspector Zhu Wenying, upon receiving the report, led the police to the scene. As soon as they left the police station, they saw a rickshaw coming towards them. Suspecting its appearance, they ordered the rickshaw to stop. The passenger jumped down and ran away, trying to escape towards the Sishui River in Qianqiao. Inspector Zhu immediately ordered senior policeman Zhu Xiaocong to chase him into the river and capture him. After strict questioning, he claimed to be named Zhou Desheng and that there were seven other accomplices who were dividing the spoils in the nearby Dahuangfen. Inspector Zhu led the police to arrest them and captured Zhao Dehua, Yang Zilin, Hu Yujia, Wu Liansheng, Zhou Zikuan, and Chen Sanda on the spot. A six-round pistol with six bullets was found on Zhao Dehua, and fifteen Browning bullets and six clothing bags were found on Yang Zilin. They were all taken to the police station and confessed to robbing the Tang family and others. Yesterday (17th) at 9 a.m., Inspector Zhu led the police to escort them to the County Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
