<p>— 都</p>
<p>平市小學教員。最近以索取欠薪無着。發生怠工風潮若不及早爲謀角决。且將有相率罷教之事。雖日昨教育當局已有發薪三成之議。然以數量相去太遠。在已發動之緊張局面中。似一時猶未得有轉圖之樞紐。估計北平有二萬以上已入小學之學荒。（根據教部二十一年所發表之民十八年度統計）集每一兒童所受教員怠工之影響。其無形學業之損失。有遠非數字所能形容者。號稱文化中心之北平。竟發生如是嚴重之事件。恢乎一大可注意之問題也。</p>
<p>我國教育事業。正値多事之秋。大學輟教。中學罷課。亦旣爲數見不尠之事實。此其所繫國家之耗損。雖已匪輕。要未有如小學風潮之更爲新傷國家元氣者也。蓋大中學風潮之掀起。類多有政治之背景猶易用手腕相消弭小學風潮。則純粹一簡單之經濟問題也使教費無相當之　定即風潮有持續之又任大中學教職者。其日常生活。宜較小學教員爲優閒安定或則藉副業爲調劑。或則恃兼職資周轉。故雖當校務停頓之際。猶肯與學生爲課外之酬答。而學生方面。亦以年齡所關。稍知自愛。有形之功課雖告中輟。無形之修養仍得進取。若在小學。則教員固無此雅量。學生亦正待管束。一遇風潮猝起。遂如擺墜之停。全部機能俱告陷落矣。</p>
<p>或者以爲小學風潮。所關旣如此其大。爲教員者。應以師資爲重。何能貿然出於怠工之一途。而貽國家無窮之損失。此言者之過也。教讀爲清苦之事。而小學教員尤爲清苦中之清苦者。些微俸給。固不足以供一家之温飽。繁重責任。又無術可資個人以迴旋。不幸經費發生困難。薪水而遭積欠使無其他接濟。即一家有斷炊之虞。教員神聖之口號。詎足以療枵腹其必出於怠工罷教而謀生活之救濟者。固意計中應有之現象也。故吾人對於大學教授挾政治意義而輟教。或不無有所懷疑。而於小學教員爲生活逼迫而怠工。則絶不致其非難。勢使然也。</p>
<p>小學教育。立整個教育之基礎。正如孩提哺乳。爲一生營養之起點。基礎營</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>贊成有不足。往往累及學生之幸　如何使之有充分生活素之培養。得適宜維他命之配劑。是爲保姆對於孩提應有之職責而小學教員之如何别擇如何維護。亦爲操教育行政權者所絶對不容忽視者也。吾人不敏。以爲各地方教育當局。此後應排除多方之困難。確定小學之經費便一般爲教員者不致以生活搖盪内心煎迫之煩惱。反映於工作。而降低效率。同時復宜於相當範圍之中。增高其俸給。使愜意於現在之地位。而絶其分外之覬覦。在此兩重條件具備之下。然後嚴定其考竅。限制其遷調俾得專心壹志於斯。聚精會神於斯。立教育之基礎。奠國本於永久。負責者幸勿以其爲老生常談且笑存之也。</p>

<p>— 秋雲</p>
<p>比白天更有意味的各種物象，在人們的腦子裏跳舞！紅色的，綠色的，電燈光的閃爍的原形，好像向一切的老爺奶奶獻着媚眼！</p>
<p>紅色的，綠色的，舞塲上軟擺着的線條，輕輕纒地上一把消瘦的骨。</p>
<p>洋房的大廳裏，從窗口爬出來的，也是一些光，幾條影子，也是紅色的，綠色的，還有聲：忘形的笑聲，美妙的歌聲，有節拍的鋼琴聲。</p>
<p>又不知從那裏來的，辨不清方向，辨不清來踪，好似週遭都在互相警應：這一種又混雜又囂張的呌喚聲！</p>
<p>酒樓裏，繼續不斷的電話的鈴聲，守在電話旁邊有許多少女的心，跳動着，顫抖着！</p>
<p>車：汽車，電車，摩托車，像許多發瘋的傢伙，跑着，呌着！</p>
<p>遠近地，汽輪怒呌！</p>
<p>夜，没有月亮，天，給一疊疊的烏雲補縫着，密佈着！但遠遠地看，是一片紅色的天呀！</p>

<p>— 俞人偉</p>
<p>南京路之夜，眞是偉大呀！立在沙遜房子下面，一直向西望去，但見年紅燈光，照耀如同白畫，把一條柏油馬路，照得滿地通紅；偉大的建築物，都被倒映在人們的脚跟底下；來往的街車，橫衝直撞，如飛一般地消逝着。</p>
<p>滙中飯店裏面抑揚的音樂，隨着風吹到人們的耳膜裏來；外面街上的人，可以看見裏面的西洋男女，擎着銀杯隨意呷酒，嗬囒水。没有福份的小塲三，瞪着燈籠也似的眼眶，嘴裏咽着唾沫。</p>
<p>華懋飯店橱窗前二個西洋婦人，觀看各樣衣料樣品，一個老槍手裏拿着一只銅表，賊模賊樣地在伊們面前晃了一晃，直把這兩個西洋婦人弄得莫名其妙，嘴裏不知咕嚕些什麽？</p>
<p>一個西崽模樣的小孩，手裏拿着一疊信札一箍腦兒望惠羅公司面前的一個信筒内亂塞，一刻功夫，一溜烟飛也似的跑到馬路對過去了。</p>
<p>永安公司前面，立着的幾個野雞，這時忽然不安本份起來，實行拉去了。被拉的口裏低聲說道：「辰光早着哩！」</p>
<p>呀！　我們的南京路呀！你偉大，你神秘，你使人麻醉，你使人徘徊着不忍離開你。</p>
<h3 id="c317">神秘之街的夜 <a href="#c317" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e317" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">317</a></h3>
<p>— 叔訓</p>
<p>輝煌的街燈，直冲上了雲霄，紅霞片片的　映在深灰的浮雲中；暮色只漸漸地濃厚下來，接着夜聲也啥啥地在這太空中悲鳴，好像告訴着人們說：「夜神已隆臨了人間，一切罪惡的活劇，要開演了。」</p>
<p>的確，這罪惡的活劇，要算在號稱神秘街之北四川路演得最熱閙。當我和影君躑躅在這高闊的四川路橋時，那郵政總局的自鳴鐘已噹噹的敲了八下，汽車，黃包車，馬車，那在發出各色各樣的節奏，年紅燈，路燈，也翻出花樣兒在十字路中閃爍，行人更是異常地擁擠，走過來，走過去。</p>
<p>在那兩旁的人行道上，人叢中，立着無數出賣靈魂的少女，等着，等着，不時還發出悽慘的喉昔！伸出瘦白的細手，向行人拖着，拉着。</p>
<p>顯然：照這樣的情形看來，北四川路完全是由衰落而變爲熱閙了。這裏！並没有炸餘的瓦碟。這裏！出並没有刀刺的裂洞，然而這裏！只有高大的洋房以及富麗的電影院，酒樓。</p>
<p>在路上；有日本婦女的木屐聲！也有英格蘭水兵的酒後的咆哮聲：更有那奏着華爾斯，却爾斯登調的爵士音聲……哄哄：從這神秘之街散出。奏成夜的交響曲。</p>
<p>風吹來了，吹遍了這長蛇似的北四川路。</p>
<h3 id="c318">蘇州的夜 <a href="#c318" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e318" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">318</a></h3>
<p>— 朱𦐂</p>
<p>夜在蘇州到底還没有上海那麽神秘和活躍，雖然在夜幕展開的時候城中的中心—觀前街上，也有紅緣的霓虹燈，放出炫人的燈光，雷電華裏，唱着蕩魄的歌聲，蛇也般的女人，在街中和人行道上，扭出曼妙的姿態；那白的微黝的肉腿，更膩膩地在長開叉的旗衫下，射出一片殢人的肉彩。假使是在夏季的話。</p>
<p>可是一過九時，觀前街上的商店，旣逐漸收市，零零落落的祇膡幾爿食物店和烟兌店，燈光是逐漸黯淡，行人是逐漸稀少，祇有剩餘的幾家開門的店中的夥友，和街頭站街的警士，還强支着精神；街中的黃包車夫，也坐在停着的車兒跟上打盹。—雖然有幾家酒樓，還不時飛出一爿五魁八馬的猜拳聲。</p>
<p>十點過後，電影院也散戲了，雖然還有一爿京戲院，正鑼鼓喧天的在演他的拿手好戲；然而街上除了附近幾家點心店，還在等散戲後觀劇者的光臨，商店已一例罷市。人呢，除了新聞記者，站岡警士，和一些工人，祇有幾副餛飩担和賣茶葉蛋者，在寒風中嘶鳴外，連停在戲院外一字兒的黃包車的車夫，也在打盹，靜候戲院散塲做一次最後的生意　　金閻門外，確比較熱閙一些。那些小阿媛，林弟等等馬路小姐，花蝴蝶般在旅館中穿出進，那「小東人…」，「奴來拉胡琴呀…的京調，小曲，也不時來着嘹喨的胡琴聲，在旅館的房間，或酒樓上散佈出來，馬路上面，出熱閙異常，胡站岡的警士，查街的巡查隊，拉客的野鷄，蕩馬路的流氓，人行道上的拆字先生……而商店呢，除了茶館，也十室九開，直到半夜京戲散場。</p>
<p>民慶里的歌女，在民坐社保障之下，久已恢復了長三的娼妓生活，院子裏的酒局，牌局，是當閙到夜深還没收局，那水月電燈的包車，更是馬路上唯一生色的物件，在夜的蘇州。</p>
<p>這就是人間天堂的，「蘇州之夜」！</p>
<h3 id="c319">西湖的夜 <a href="#c319" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e319" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">319</a></h3>
<p>— 楊逸</p>
<p>有一天，也許恰是夏歷六月十六日罷，旁晚，我散步到白堤畔上西湖名勝之一的平湖秋月去乘凉。</p>
<p>那可畏的太陽，剛剛被矮小秀麗的峯巒呑蝕下去。周圍靄然的和靑綠色的遠近參差的山峯，漸漸失掉了秀麗的美貌；髣髴將要生病似的，由灰白而變成鐵靑色可怕的面孔。澄綠的湖水也變成了黝黑色。</p>
<p>男女遊人，靑年學生，一對一對的沿着白堤，馬路，在垂柳和電燈下走着，談着，嬉笑着，秋蟬得意似的在樹梢上呌着。湖面的小船，載着老頭子，老太婆，小孩子，姑娘，學生，情侣，大踏步的競走着。湖濱馬路上，白堤上，闊人們兜風的汽車虎虎的賽跑着。</p>
<p>從遠近各處送來的音樂聲］！唱戲聲！笑語聲！喧閙聲！犬吠聲！蟲聲！蛙聲！風聲！水聲！小孩子的哭呌聲！山寺裏的鐘鼓聲，人們的　官，大有山陰道士應接不暇之勢。</p>
<p>『好呀；好看呀：』</p>
<p>『你瞧；那不是一個火球！』</p>
<p>『好像血一般的紅呢！』</p>
<p>『你瞧！多麽好看！湖面上那不是一條火龍嗎！』</p>
<p>猛然一陣的呐喊。小孩子們高興得亂跳亂呌。</p>
<p>哭眯眯的繁星，出都好像凖備着歡迎伊—月球似的。</p>
<p>這時候，我嫌太喧囂了，離開了平湖秋月，沿着白堤走向已經很完美的斷橋去。那高立在葛嶺上的賣叔塔默然的瞰視着平靜的大湖。裏西湖内，紅，白粉紅各色的荷花，綠絹傘樣的蓬葉，日間爭妍鬥艶的，此刻因爲顯不出它們的姣麗，也髣髴懶洋洋的在微風中盪漾着寂然的睡着了。</p>
<p>回頭看那正在努力向上的皎潔的月球，似乎笑嘻嘻的向着湖上的遊人說：</p>
<p>别太懶散了！</p>
<p>别貪玩了！</p>
<p>别失去了大好寶貴的光陰！</p>
<p>來罷！</p>
<p>來！跟着我不息的努力的前停罷！</p>

<p>— 金樓</p>
<p>深夜，我踏着都市的銀街前進，彩色商店的弧絲燈予人以强烈的桃色的刺激，旁的陰影裏站滿着把肉零賣的雞姬，我不忍注視伊們　邊猩紅的顔色，急急地遁去！</p>
<p>耳邊是喧閙的歌聲，臥屍似的東方旅館，被白熱的電燈照得通明，窗帘上：依然交錯着憧憧的人影和杯光，依然吐出一陣陣的嘻笑聲，這笑聲彷彿是一般牙排裏滲着血的人們的囓人的笑聲！</p>
<p>我有些憤然，開始咒詛；</p>
<p>這些，這些在黃金堆裏活躍着的，這些在銷金窩裏沉迷着的，這些粉紅色的夢裏無限制的嘗着肉的滋味的……啊！誰說不是對於我們糜爛的靈魂極度的譏嘲呢？誰說不是對於一般爲生活的壓榨而暴露伊們肉體的賣笑者極度的迫害呢？</p>
<p>我並不咒强烈的燈光下蠟樣的歌女，伊們，或許並不全然祈求的黃金的賜予，伊們都是爲生的鞭策而給人摧殘的可憶的夜的賣笑者，但伊們的笑，何曾是笑？伊們的歌聲，何曾是歌聲？是怯弱，細小，乾枯的顫動的呌喊！是呌出一切柔弱的靈魂和一切被侮辱者的心的悲哀；</p>
<p>伊們——夜的賣笑者，永遠得不到生命的妥帖，永遠不敢放棄滲血的脂粉和咽淚的媚笑，伊們始終只是在深夜的陰影裏，在熱光的烘射下被迫害着—以至於死！</p>
<p>於是，可憐呵！這般没有眞實悟性和反抗性的夜的賣笑者，也始終被我們的筆尖下可憐着！</p>
<p>「啊！夜的賣笑者！</p>
<p>者你們是西伯利亞戌地裏被强暴的獸卒姦汚的女犯！</p>
<p>你們是被猶太人在亞路撒冷　閙的市頭迫着露顯肉體的女教徒！」</p>

<p>— 黃影呆</p>
<p>這眞是無奇不有，在大上海的都市之中，除了普通的大學之外，又不什麽夜大學，顧名思義，夜大學自然在晚上上課的。惟其是在夜晚上課，這裏的生活，便和一般的大學有所不同了。</p>
<p>大學生在學費如此高貴的時代，家裏没有財産，休想使你跨進門檻，兒子在大學裏讀書，一年少不可由家裏寄八百一千塊錢來：但在夜大學裏，白天都是有職務的人，因爲感到學識不夠利用了夜的餘閒在夜大學裏求學，所以這裏顯然有平民化的表露，出用不到家裏寄錢來</p>
<p>四點半是開始上課了，但辦公室須五時停工，這一課眞不能選呢！就是選五點半的一課，五點鐘從辦公室跑到學校裏路遠的出夠不着時間，這時一般的同學，十九都在興怱怱的跑來，比軍人上火線還急，怕的是脫了上課的鐘點，而到達學校之時，已十九氣喘吁吁了。</p>
<p>白天做工，晚上讀書，已實行了工讀的方式，自已供給自已的學費，使職業和教育打成一片，是多麽値得驕傲的一件事。但白天做了七八小時的工作，晚上再讀四五小時的書，精神是有限，在課堂上，如果教員提不起學生精神，也許有不少人要瞌睡呢！</p>
<p>雖然有西裝的少年，有摩登的女士，在一課堂裏研究學識，但在這裏，却没有皇后的竸選，宫主的稱呼，女同學們和男同學，除了極少數之外很少互相談話的；因此，如果碰到男女同學在一起談話，便會引起好多人的注意，所謂少見而多怪！</p>
<p>如果自四點半到九點半，一連選了三四小時的課，吃夜飯便生問題了。餓着肚皮聽講，耳朶和手在加緊的工作着，而肚皮裏又在大唱其空城計，這便是特别風味，等到散課回來，已是飢腸轆轆跑到家裡來不及的去吃飯了。</p>
<p>雖然在這夜大學中，表露着一種平民化的色彩，大多數的同學，到校和回家的時候，十九是步行，但這裡，也有幾輛汽車接送同學，不過是少數罷了；因此，當散學的時候汽車裡伊們或他们便會引起一般同學的注意和羡慕。</p>
<p>當散學的時候；男女同學，在一條狹窄的扶梯下了樓，走出了門口，四散的各自回家了。偶然女同學的後面，有男同學跟着走，有意或無意，我且不管，但我們很少看見伊們回頭一顧，在這裡事實已明白的告訴我們，夜大學裡的女同學，誰都是表示着一種「神聖而不可侵犯」的態度呢！</p>
<p>間爭妍鬥艶的，此刻因爲顯不出它們的姣麗，也髣髴懶洋洋的在微風中盪漾着寂然的睡着了。</p>
<p>回頭看那正在努力向上的皎潔的月球，似乎笑嘻嘻的禹着湖上的遊人說：</p>
<p>别太懶散了！</p>
<p>别貪玩了！</p>
<p>别失去了大好寳貴光隂！</p>
<p>來罷！</p>
<p>來！跟着我不息的努力的遂進罷！</p>

<h3 id="c322">關於建設新村 <a href="#c322" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e322" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">322</a></h3>
<p>— 唐弢</p>
<p>近幾年來，受着社會不安定的影響，人們都想逃避現實，　奉自殺的以爲一了可以百了，皈依佛法的也總把萬事都看做鏡花水月；卽使不是全無意識的，但獨善其身的結果，對於不安定非但無所補救，只有简接助其增長而已。</p>
<p>在這種消極的情形下，居然有一個努力於建設新村的團體出現，那是可喜的。</p>
<p>自從五四以後，舊社會的組織，已經不適公於一般的需要。文藝界持其初步的理想，對於建設新村，鼓吹不遺餘力。這種理想被表現到小說上的，也已數見不鮮。這幾年，有好多從海外回來的知識階級，到過新興國的鄉村，度過新鮮活潑的生活的，一旦重到這二千年來輕易不曾改變的環境裏來，枯燥吵雜驅使他們走上改革的路途；在草草的經營下，新本的計劃便被實踐了。</p>
<p>然而緊接着這實踐的，依舊是枯燥吵雜的一片。他們是失敗了。</p>
<p>失敗的原因，除了中國政治的不上軌道，永遠給予社會改造者以莫大痛苦外，第二個緣故，是内部組織的不完善。</p>
<p>後起者是没有重蹈這個覆轍的理由的。</p>
<p>誰都知道，能夠建設在大衆心上的，才是健全的事業。而今日中國的大衆，是勞苦的貧民。第一步急需改造的，是亭子間，閣樓，草棚，茅舍的生活。建設新村，應該從這一個階級着手。至於擁有幾萬現欵的小資産階級，雖然能夠造幾憧新的洋房，組一個新的村莊，然而曾幾何時，一切都得隨他們的靈魂同趨没落。</p>
<p>何况新村的計劃不是逃避，不能存絲毫世外桃源的妄想。新村的住户所過的不應該是安閑享樂的日子，而應該是在同一目標下，在同一步伐下，更積極地和人生奮鬥的日子。</p>
<p>一切舒齊美滿的號召，在這裡是多餘的。</p>
<p>武者小路實篤說得好：「新村的目的是在營人的生活，走人的正路，解去衣食住的憂盧，發揚人的光榮，確立對於人的信仰」。（僅就記憶所及，　之）。這裡所謂「人」，是有正確的新的意義的。</p>
<p>所以，新村的責任，在使這個世界上没有非人的生活，非人的行爲，非人的思想；新村的責任是前進，不是後退。</p>
<h3 id="c323">「感舊」以後（上） <a href="#c323" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e323" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">323</a></h3>
<p>— 豐之餘</p>
<p>又不小心，感了一下子舊，就引出了一篇施蟄存先生的「莊子與文選」來，以爲我那些話，是爲他而發的，但又希望並不是爲他而發的。</p>
<p>我願意有幾句聲明：那篇「感舊」，是並非爲施先生而作的，然而可以有施先生在裏面。</p>
<p>倘使專對個人而發的話，照現在的摩登文例，應該調查了對手的籍貫，出身，相貌，甚而至於他家鄕有什麽出産，他老子開過什麽舖子，影射他幾句才算合式。我的那一篇裏可是毫没有這些的。内中所指，是一大隊遺少羣的風氣，並不指定着誰和誰；但也因爲所指的是一羣，所以被觸着的當然出不會少，即使不是整個，也是那里的一肢一節，即使並不永遠屬於那一隊，但有時是屬於那一隊的。現在施先生自說了勸過靑年去讀「莊子與文選」，「爲文學修養之助」，就自然和我所指摘的有點相關，但以爲這文爲他而作，却誠然是「神經過敏」，我實在並没有這意思。</p>
<p>不過這是在施先生没有說明他的意見之前的話，現在連這「相關」也有些陳遠了，因爲我所指摘的，倒是比較頑固的遺少羣，標準還要高一點。</p>
<p>現在看了施先生自已的解釋，（一）才知道他當時的情形，是因爲稿紙太小了，「倘再寬闊一點的話」，他「是想多寫幾部書進去的」：（二）才知道他先前的履歷，是「從國文教員轉到編雜誌」，覺得「靑年人的文章太拙直，字彙太小」了，所以推舉了這兩部古書，使他們去學文法，尋字彙，「雖然其中有許多字是已死了的」，然而出只好去尋覓。我想，假如莊子生在今日，則被劈棺之後，恐怕要勸一切有志於結婚的女子，都去看「烈女傳」的罷。</p>
<p>還有一點另外的話—</p>
<p>（一）施先生說我用瓶和酒來比「文學修養」，是不對的，但我並未這麽比方過，我是說有些新靑年可以有舊思想，有些舊形式也可以藏新内容。我也以爲「新文學」和「舊文學」這中間不能有截然的分界，然而有蛻變，有比較的偏向，而且正因爲不能以「何　爲分界」，所以也没有了「第三種人」的立塲。</p>
<p>（二）施先生說寫𡩀字等類，都是個人的事情，只要不去勉强别人也做一樣的事情就好，這似乎是很對的。然而中學生和投稿者，是他們自已個人的文章太拙直，字彙太小，却並没有勉强别人都去做字彙少而文法拙直的文章，施先生爲什麽竟大有所感，因此來勸「有志于文學的靑年」該看「莊子與文選」了呢？做了考官，以詞取士，施先生是不以爲然的，但一做教員和編輯，却以「莊子與文選」勸靑所，我眞不懂這中間有怎樣的分界。</p>
<p>（三）施先生還舉出一個「魯迅先生」來，好像他承接了「莊子」的新道統，一切文章，都是讀「莊子與文選」讀出來的一般。「我以爲這也有點武斷的」，他的文章中，誠然有許多字爲「莊子與文選」中所有，例如「之乎者也」之類，但這些字眼，想來别的書上也不見得没有罷。再說得露骨一點，則從這樣的書裏去找活字彙，簡直是胡塗蟲，恐怕施先生自已也未必。</p>
<h3 id="c324">秋陰蕞記　一買書考言 <a href="#c324" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e324" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">324</a></h3>
<p>— 郁達夫</p>
<p>前兩三年，英國Holbrook　Jackson印行了一部Anagomy　of　Biblionlania的大著。這部「愛書狂的解剖」的内容豐富，引證賅博，眞可以和Ｒobert　Burton的Anatomy　of　Melaocboly比比。愛書狂者的心理，古今中外，似乎都是一例的。中國有宋版蝴蝶裝明印綿紙等等的研究，外國人的收藏家，也有不惜化去幾萬金元，買一册初版（Ｆrist　Edition）詩集或文集的人。例如勃郎蒂氏姊妺三人的詩集之由Aylott　and　Jones發行者，薄薄的一册Poems　by　Curer'Ellis　and　Acton　Bell可以賣到八九百鎊或千鎊以上的金洋。原因是因爲有一天夏洛蒂忽而發現了愛彌麗的詩稿，姊妺三人就商議著自費來印行一部詩集，恰好倫敦的Aylott　＆Jones山版業者答應以三十鎊的價錢來替她們印刷發行，但一年之後，這部詩集，只賣去了兩本。姊妺三人，於送了幾本給友人之外，就决定把其餘的詩集去售結箱子舖裏糊裏子去了。但後來却以較好的條件，轉讓給了Smitb'Elder　＆　Co·去出版，所以由Aylott　＆　Ｊones印行的詩集，就可以賣得到那麽的高價。</p>
<p>這一種珍本市價的抬高，中國自胡適之做了幾篇小說考證之後，風氣也流行關來了。現在弄得連一本本版黃紙的三字經百家姓龍文影之類的啓蒙書，都要賣到幾塊大洋一本。所謂國學，成了有錢的人的專門學問，没有錢的人，也落得習些愛皮西提，去求捷徑，於是大腹買的狡猾舊書商，就得其所哉，箇箇都發起財來了。</p>
<p>前數箇月，施蟄存先生，曾寫過一篇上海灘上買西文舊籍的記事，但根據着我自已的經騐來看，則上海灘上的西書舊籍，價錢亦復不賤。每逢看到了一册心愛的舊書，議價不成的時候，眞有索性請希脫勒或秦始皇來專一專政的想頭。但走到了街上，平心靜氣地一思索，中國的同胞，饑不得食，寒不得衣的人，還有好幾千萬在那裏待斃，則又覺我輩的買的書，也是和資本家們的狂歡醉舞是同樣的惡德了。</p>
<h3 id="c325">陳炯明與致公堂 <a href="#c325" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e325" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">325</a></h3>
<p>— 何如</p>
<p>月前報載陳炯明靈堂，棺上覆以致公堂黨旗，以示其爲致公堂黨魁。旗上爲并字形，象微井田以示平均地權，耕者有其田之意。何謂致公堂或致公黨？知者不多，茲據同盟會之機關雜志民報所載，略述於此。</p>
<p>致以堂重訂新章要義發端云：「原夫致公堂之設，由來已久。本愛國保種之心，立興漢復仇之志。聯盟結義，聲應氣求。民族主義頼之而昌，秘密社會因之日盛。早已遍布於十八行省，與及五洲各國，凡華人所到之地，莫不有之，而尤以美國爲隆盛。舊居於平等自由之域，其和民政之邦，結會聯盟，皆無所禁，此洪門之發達，固其宜矣。」可知致公堂原爲洪門之一種秘密結社，其有民族革命思想，起源於中土，發達於美國。聞當時隸籍致公堂之留美華僑，至數萬人之多，可以想見其盛况。其新章要義又云：「今幸遇愛國志士孫逸仙先生來游美洲，本堂請同黃三德三佬，往游各埠，演說洪門宗旨，發輝中國時事。各埠同人始如大夢初覺，因知中國前途，吾黨實有其責。先生更代訂立章程，指示辦法，以爲津導，我旅美同人可以乘時而興矣。」此則可以考見最初民黨與致公堂之結合，而孫中山實爲該堂改進之倡導者，凡寫革命史之作家不可不知也。其重訂新章綱領有云：</p>
<p>本堂以驅除韃虜，恢復中華，創立民國，平均地權爲宗旨。</p>
<p>本堂以恊力助成祖國同志施行宗旨爲目的。凡新進堂友須遵守洪門香生陳近南先生遺訓，行禮入聞。</p>
<p>觀其綱領，已略具革命黨之規模，而孫中山先生「代訂立章程，指示辦法，」實領導之。陳炯明死後，其親友爲之治喪，但用致公堂旗，示與民黨異向，孰知致公堂之得以近代政黨化，實賴民黨先覺提携領導之力乎？</p>
<h3 id="c326">秋之日 <a href="#c326" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e326" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">326</a></h3>
<p>— 靳以</p>
<p>深秋裏的大早晨，寂靜的天地中有樹葉落地的聲音，陽光繼只徘徊在屋頂之上、巷子裏依然是幽暗的。這古老的城市，還没有蘇醒過來，比本體大了四五倍的影子錯綜地排在地上，如這城的筋絡，但也是黯淡的。秋日的風吹抖了人的身子，也吹抖了人的心；湖水像是懷了沉重的心情而靜止着了。烏鴉在飛着，在打着旋，那没有一點光澤的黑羽毛，銹　地更增厚了對它們的厭惡，而它們却又像是聰明地，掁盡了這些年的興衰變遷，就用失望的聲音呌着，那麽呌着。</p>
<p>但是這城有無數無數的人住着，活着；有好幻想與希望的。從這一面看着，這城該没有死亡之一日，爲了各把才力藏在心中，見面只說一句：「好爽快的秋天」！</p>
<p>秋天是這樣爽快的麽？金黃的殿瓦上，有漸成金黃色的細草，風來時，　角的銅鈴寂寞地響着，在這鈴聲之中，像有多多少少的事將要告白出來；可是不爲人所明瞭，也不爲人所知道，只有一隊駱駝走過去的時節，項下的串鈴出響着不爲人所明瞭的回答。於是隨了這長途跋涉的駱駝，走過山，走過水，走到無垠的荒沙。</p>
<p>凄凉的號角在吹着了。</p>
<p>秋日的天是又高又藍的，艶艶的紅葉雖是盡力裝點着，也不能使人不想到好的時日是已經没有了，正如遲暮的老人想着死亡，是只能用着無盡的　嘆來追想過去了。但是過去不也都是遙遙的麽？幻想到夜合歡，就望到如鳥羽的葉子，翩翩地墜於途上了。</p>
<p>隔夜的寒霜漸漸能成爲明亮的珠子。</p>
<p>街上仍然是清靜的，穿了紅认傴背的清道夫，一下一下地掃着路上積葉，用遲鈍的脚步向前推進着。警士的一聲伸欠，聽到遠遠的地方。寺廟的晨鐘，悠悠然地在空中蕩着。一個孤獨的中处人在這時候醒轉來了。</p>
<p>近來是，醒來的時辰，一天比一天早；而且到了晚間，總有更大的疲乏壓在他的身上。每天總在想着！「這可該有一個又長又好的睡眠」；可是又常是很早京醒來，就是焦燥着，想再捉回來那從身上溜走了的，也只成爲不可能的事了，在以前，爲這奇異的現象驚訝着，漸漸地知道了，知道在人生的途中他已經可以中遙遙的地方看得見衰老的影子。</p>
<p>於是，什麽都可以找得出解釋來了，那常是酸痛的身子，那更濃重的感傷，那怕見的秋日景物，那撲在他心上的黑影，更大更黑了，……</p>
<p>他坐起身來，把脚伸到鞋裏去，拖着懶懶的步子，站到立鏡的前面去。近來他有在每日清晨看看自已一日夜間是老過了若干的心情。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Fang Ji's troops in the northwest of Shunyi constantly harass the south. The National Army has repeatedly repelled them. The Japanese army in Niulanshan has increased by over a hundred men, and military action is expected against Fang Ji's troops. Fang Zhenwu has again dispatched Guo Yunlong to Beiping. The Beiping authorities still hope Fang will leave the army soon. Japanese planes drop bombs on Dulinzhuang. <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) Official news: Fang Ji's bandit troops are entrenched in villages northwest of Shunyi. They again harassed the south last night, but were met with a fierce attack by the National Army. The bandit troops were unable to withstand the assault and retreated in disarray. They are now entrenched in places such as Dongxi Dulinzhuang and Yamen Village. The morale of the troops is low, and there are many deserters. However, Fang himself has not repented. He has dispatched his representative, Guo Yunlong, to Beiping to meet with the military authorities. It is reported that the authorities still hope that Fang will realize his error and leave the army soon. (Seventeenth dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After Fang Ji fled to Niulanshan, he still attempted to cross the Chaobai River. The 5th Regiment of the Japanese Army stationed in Gubeikou, in order to implement a blockade, used over forty heavy-laden trucks yesterday morning to transport approximately six hundred Japanese soldiers from Gubeikou and Miyun, carrying mountain guns and machine guns, to Niulanshan, Shunyi, to establish a defensive perimeter. Yesterday, over three hundred Japanese soldiers were transported back from Niulanshan to Huairou to be stationed there, to strictly prevent Fang's army from returning. Only a few dozen Japanese soldiers remained in the city of Miyun, guarding the city gates. (Fourteenth Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Fang Ji himself is still in the army. Fang Ji's remnant troops fled eastward beyond Gaoliying. Yesterday, they were still gathered in the Dulinzhuang area north of Shunyi. There are occasional small clashes with the garrison north of Shunyi. The Japanese military is determined to prevent Fang Ji's remaining troops from heading east. The previous day, they shelled Fang's army from the banks of the Baihe River. It is reported that the Japanese army near Niulanshan will still take military action against Fang Ji's troops. (Fourteenth Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Military headquarters in Gaoliying reports that two Japanese aircraft came to scout this morning around 11 a.m. They dropped more than ten bombs in the Fang army positions in the Dongxi Dulinzhuang area, causing heavy damage. (Fourteenth Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Military news: Fang Ji's remnant troops are entrenched in the Dongxi Dulinzhuang area near Shunyi, intending to continue fleeing east. Because the Japanese side is preventing them from crossing the Baihe River, they want to come south along the war zone. Our army dispatched teams to block them. Starting at one o'clock last night, the bandit troops struggled like cornered beasts, moving south from Dongxi Dulinzhuang and harassing Donghaihong, Xihaihong Wangquan Village, and the Liu Jia River area. They were repeatedly repelled by our army. Our army is currently searching forward and fiercely attacking. It is only a matter of time before this unit is eliminated. (Fourteenth Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Official news: At twelve o'clock on the thirteenth night, about three or four hundred of Fang Ji's remnant troops advanced from Daxiao Dulinzhuang toward Jiaojiazhuang and Dajiangzhuang, making contact with our defending army sentries. The sentries resisted while retreating to Liujiahe Village, intending to lure the bandit troops in and then eliminate them. Unexpectedly, after the bandit troops advanced to Dajiangzhuang and Jiaojiazhuang, they immediately retreated and are now entrenched in the Dongxi Dulinzhuang area, facing off against the defending army. (Fourteenth Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Shunyi reports that two Japanese aircraft flew over Shunyi County today, flying low and circling for about ten minutes. They dropped more than ten bombs near Dongxi Dulinzhuang. Losses are unknown. (Fourteenth Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Last night, three or four hundred of Fang's army in plain clothes fired shots along the Chaobai River toward the southwest of Shunyi, causing disturbance, but were repelled by our army. When Fang's troops retreated, they set fire to the accumulated firewood and grass outside Dulinzhuang. The dense smoke did not dissipate until eight o'clock this morning. Over a hundred Japanese soldiers in Niulanshan were increased this morning, having arrived from Huairou. They were stationed in the town. At noon, two trucks of ammunition and supplies were transported from Huairou, escorted by six Japanese soldiers. The residents of Yamen Village, Dongxi Dulinzhuang, Sanjia Dian, and other villages occupied by Fang's army have gradually fled. Shunyi County was placed under curfew at 6:00 p.m. yesterday due to the harassment by Fang's army near the county seat. The city gates are inspecting pedestrians. County Magistrate Su Shijun has consulted with the garrison to organize a joint military-police office to maintain security in the city. (Fourteenth Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) It is reported that Ji Hongchang is currently in Baixiangyang, and Fang Zhenwu is reporting from a small village among the villages in Nanshicao, north of Shunyi. (Fourteenth Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A person from Miyun said that there were gunshots near Yamen Village, and artillery fire was heard in the Gaoliying area. It is reported that the Japanese army is blocking Fang's troops, resulting in conflict. (Fourteenth Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Beiping-Miyun long-distance bus service resumed this morning. (Fourteenth Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Regarding the matter of Tang's troops contacting about reorganization, a representative had previously gone to Zhangjiakou to consult with Song. Later, it was put on hold due to the Fang Ji incident. It is reported that recent progress has been made. In general, Tang's troops, apart from those with complete firearms and good discipline, will be allowed to be enlisted. Those who are not formal troops will be dismissed. It is said that Tang himself may become the Commander of Bandit Suppression in the Chahar area, but this has not yet been confirmed. (Fourteenth Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tang's representatives Wu Jiabin and Sun Chengwu are scheduled to travel to Beiping with Song's special train on the 16th to meet with He [Yingqin] to discuss the reorganization. (Fourteenth Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Dihua reports that the war in Tacheng has begun. Sheng Shicai arrived in Turpan on the 12th. Ma Zhongying's troops have massacred as many as 20,000 Han Chinese. There has been fighting in southern Xinjiang. Communication between Gansu and Xinjiang has been severed. (Fourteenth Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Sheng Shicai's representative, Zhang Yuanfu, was summoned by Chiang [Kai-shek] and passed through Xuzhou from Tianjin on the 14th evening to go to Nanjing and then Jiangxi to report on the recent situation in Xinjiang Province. Zhang said that the military situation in Xinjiang Province is not a problem. Most of the Ma Zhongying troops who were previously entrenched have surrendered to Sheng, and the situation can be resolved within two or three weeks. The political situation appears to be better but will take a longer period of time to gradually get on track. However, it is essential to first develop transportation capabilities, which will facilitate measures. As for international relations, there is currently an economic and educational crisis because the majority of the people in Xinjiang purchase Soviet goods, and many of the outstanding individuals study in the Soviet Union and Turkey. The development of Xinjiang Province must focus on communications, relaying political information, which is the fundamental measure. Yao Yijia was hired as the chief examiner for the national martial arts examination and traveled south on the same train as Zhang. Yao said that the development of the Northwest cannot be delayed.

<p>(Beiping) The Bandit Suppression Security Team of the War Zone will depart within one or two days. Since most of the bandits have entered from outside the pass, our side plans to deploy police to guard various small passes of the Great Wall while the Japanese army guards the large passes during the bandit suppression, strictly preventing bandits from crossing over. After the banditry is eliminated, our side will negotiate with the Japanese side regarding the various passes of the Great Wall, dispatching police to be stationed there long-term to prevent bandits from outside the pass from entering again. Refugees gathered in Kuliushu and Sunhezhen are mostly fleeing towards Beiping. (Fourteenth Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Zhangjiakou reports: Chahar Provincial Commissioner Zhuotebazhapu said, "I plan to go to Beiping at the end of the month or the beginning of next month to meet with He [Yingqin] to discuss the affairs of the Chahar Mongol Security Chief's Office. The issue of autonomy in Inner Mongolia is being manipulated and controlled by Prince De, who is borrowing the names of a few Mongols. When he was the acting League leader in the 21st year [of the Republic, i.e., 1932], he left many blank orders and convened an autonomy meeting under false pretenses. The real League leaders were unaware. Six of the ten banners of the Xilingol League do not agree, and all twelve banners of Chahar are unaware. Even if there is talk of holding a meeting, I am afraid there will not be enough people to make it happen. The former League leader of the Xilingol League, Yang Sangzhen, sent someone to Chahar, stating that the autonomy of Inner Mongolia was completely unknown, and all six banners will not participate. The Mongol land is extremely poor, and any attempt to make progress will be difficult." (Fourteenth Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e25">The Beiping City Primary School Teachers' Strike <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>—Du</p>
<p>The Beiping City primary school teachers, recently due to not getting their back pay, have started a strike. If a solution isn't found quickly, there will be a mass walkout. Although the education authorities yesterday already proposed paying 30% of the salaries, because the amount is too far off, it seems like there is no way to turn the situation around yet in the tense situation that has already developed. It is estimated that in Beiping, there are more than 20,000 who have already been affected by the strike (according to statistics released by the Ministry of Education in the 21st year of the Republic [1932] from 1929). The intangible loss to learning for each child affected by the teacher's strike is far beyond what numbers can describe. Beiping, which claims to be the cultural center, has experienced such a serious event, which is a major issue that deserves attention.</p>
<p>Our nation's education system is in troubled times. Universities stopping classes, middle schools on strike have already become common occurrences. The national costs associated with these events, although not small, are still not as harmful as the primary school strike which is further damaging the nation. In general, the rising tide of unrest in universities and middle schools often has a political background, making it easier to resolve using manipulation. The primary school strike, however, is purely a simple economic problem. If there is no stable funding for teaching, strikes will continue. Also, those who hold teaching positions in universities and middle schools generally have more leisure and stability than primary school teachers, or can find balance through part-time work or using side jobs to make ends meet. Therefore, even when school is stopped, they are still willing to meet students outside of class. And students, because of their age, have some sense of self-respect. The tangible classes may be stopped, but the intangible cultivation can still be pursued. But in primary school, teachers do not have this generosity and students are waiting to be managed. When a strike suddenly breaks out, the whole mechanism stops completely, like a stopped pendulum.</p>
<p>Or some may think that since the primary school strike has such an important impact, teachers should prioritize their profession. How can they rashly use the method of striking and cause endless loss to the country? This is the fault of those who say that. Teaching is a poor job, and primary school teaching is the poorest of the poor. Their meager salary is not enough to feed their family, and the heavy responsibility means they have no room for personal discretion. Unfortunately, when funding problems occur, salary payments are delayed, so without other sources of help, the family is at risk of starvation. The idea of the sacredness of the teacher will not be enough to heal an empty stomach, and it is expected that they will use strikes and teaching walkouts to save their livelihoods. Therefore, we may have doubts when university professors drop classes for political reasons, but we would not criticize primary school teachers for striking because they are forced by life. It is the way things are.</p>
<p>Primary school education establishes the foundation for the entire education system, just like a baby's first feeding provides the foundation for their whole life. If the foundation isn't</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>supported enough, students often suffer. How to provide enough nutrients so they can receive the right vitamins is what the caregiver should do for the baby, and how to choose and protect primary school teachers should also be something that those with power over education must not ignore. I think that local education authorities should in the future overcome difficulties and confirm funding for primary schools so that teachers do not have to worry about their livelihood and reflect that in their work, lowering their efficiency. At the same time, the salary should be raised within a reasonable range, so they are satisfied with their current position and no longer have unrealistic ambitions. After these two conditions are met, their performance should be strictly evaluated and their transfers restricted, so they can concentrate and focus on building the foundation of education and establishing the foundation of the country for the long term. I hope those responsible will not laugh at this as a commonplace and preserve it.</p>

<p>The tense situation in Bangkok is comparable to Shanghai in 1927 when the Chinese National Revolutionary Army advanced on Shanghai. The government army is now attempting to prevent the revolutionary army from approaching Bangkok. It is feared that the war will spread within the city. It is reported that the revolutionary army is advancing in two routes. One route is commanded by Prince Bodetrat, a member of the royal family and former Minister of Defense. Commerce in Bangkok has stopped, and many shops have closed their doors. Banks and foreign embassies are guarded by soldiers. The authorities have ordered residents outside the city to move into the city to avoid danger. Many residents of the city have prepared to evacuate elsewhere. Some have already left the city for safer locations. The entire city is in a state of panic. This revolution is the third in the past sixteen months. Chinese people make up nearly half of the city's population, most of whom are laborers. According to a recent survey, there are over 450,000 residents in Bangkok.

<p>(Tokyo) The first Trade Deliberation Council meeting was held at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 10:00 AM today. Foreign Minister Hirota delivered the opening address, stating that Japan's diplomatic policy after withdrawing from the League of Nations holds significant importance in terms of economic diplomacy. Due to obstructed access in trade with China, coupled with Japan's industrial progress and the depreciation of the Japanese currency, Japanese goods have been advancing into overseas markets. However, this has led to restrictions on the import of Japanese goods, or even the unilateral cancellation of existing treaties. Japan must steadfastly defend its existing markets while also recognizing the need to secure new markets. The Trade Bureau has been repeatedly studying this issue, but this is not sufficient. Therefore, related government agencies, knowledgeable individuals, and practitioners have been brought together. (Fourteenth dispatch from the Electric Communication)</p>

<h3 id="e32">Saito Explains the Content of the Five-Minister Conference <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Today, Prime Minister Saito met with a group of reporters at his official residence and made the following statement: It is difficult to predict when the Five-Minister Conference will conclude. I hope it will be after the end of the grand military exercises. However, this conference is not necessarily a conference that must achieve a certain outcome; it is merely a forum for each participant to express their opinions. Initially, it was intended for each relevant minister to hear about policies regarding national defense, finance, and diplomacy. Therefore, it has no direct relationship with the budget. However, the outcome may involve the budget. Society seems to be paying close attention to this conference, but it is not of great importance. The scope of discussion now covers national defense, finance, and diplomacy. If it involves other ministries, relevant ministers will also be invited to attend. Rumors that the military, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs hold conflicting opinions are untrue. The decisions made at the Five-Minister Conference may be used as material for national policy, but they will not directly become national policy. What is more difficult than the Five-Minister Conference is the upcoming Cabinet deliberation on the budget. Regarding the verdicts in the May 15th Incident, although young naval officers may have various opinions, once the military court has made a decision, what else is there to say? Regarding Admiral Osumi, there are indeed rumors, but I hope he will dedicate himself to the country. (Fourteenth dispatch from the Electric Communication)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After yesterday's regular cabinet meeting, Prime Minister Saito specifically retained Home Minister Yamamoto and Finance Minister Takahashi for a long meeting. Judging from this meeting, Prime Minister Saito initially attempted to establish a unified national policy, targeting 1935, encompassing diplomacy, national defense, and finance. However, the conference resulted in conflicting opinions regarding national defense and diplomacy, particularly concerning the issue of concluding a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union, which led to a stalemate. Therefore, at the next Five-Minister Conference on the 16th, opinions will continue to be exchanged on this point, believing that (1) under the current international situation, it is not the time to determine fixed and concrete diplomatic policies, (2) regarding national defense issues, there is no objection to the Navy's Second Replenishment Plan. At the same time, regarding the Army's expenses, if the Army authorities' proposed national defense plan has a predictable basis, their demands must also be accommodated to ensure that national defense capabilities are without regret. Yesterday, this intent was reported to Home Minister Yamamoto, seeking his understanding. Prime Minister Saito's future direction for the Five-Minister Conference is that if a conclusion cannot be reached at the 16th meeting, which focuses on relations with Russia, he plans to convene two or three more meetings and then suspend it, and then reopen it as necessary. It is reported that the relevant ministers have all agreed on this. On the other hand, Minister of Railways Mitsuchi told Finance Minister Takahashi that the recent Five-Minister Conference, especially the movements of the military related to it, have caused widespread anxiety in the world. He asked what the content of the conference was. Finance Minister Takahashi replied that even if the Five-Minister Conference fails to reach a conclusion, there will be no other anxieties in the political situation.

Japan will completely withdraw from the League of Nations in 1935, which is something Australia cannot ignore. Moreover, if Australia is attacked, it is impossible for the British mainland to dispatch warships. Therefore, it is necessary to jointly agree with the United States on the defense of Australia. Australia must establish a naval base on its coast, to be used for the common interests of Britain and the United States." (World News Agency)</p>

<p>(Berlin) This afternoon, it was officially announced here that due to Geneva's opposition to Germany's demands for rearmament, Germany will withdraw from the League of Nations and the Disarmament Conference. German President Hindenburg has ordered the dissolution of the Reichstag, with new elections scheduled for November 11th, to gauge the people's attitude towards the government's intention to withdraw from the League of Nations and the Disarmament Conference.

<p>(London) Europe is greatly shocked by Germany's withdrawal from the League of Nations and the Disarmament Conference. This news was announced by German Chancellor Hitler himself at the Cabinet meeting. The reason is apparently to respond to the major powers' rejection of Germany's disarmament demands. Germany initially believed that the major powers' front had already broken, but unexpectedly, British Foreign Secretary Simon's speech at the Disarmament Conference this morning, although still moderate in tone, was very firm in its resolve. As a result, Germany realized that the major powers' front was stronger than before, and was greatly disappointed. Therefore, it made a major decision. Simon declared opposition to Germany's rearmament. US representative Davis, French representative Poncet, Italian representative Salagrana, and representatives from Greece and Czechoslovakia all agreed. At that time, it was decided to submit Simon's speech to the Disarmament General Commission meeting on Monday. However, this only indicated that Simon's proposal would receive majority support. In view of public opinion, Germany decided to withdraw from the League of Nations, rather than submit. Germany is now not only dissolving the Reichstag, so that voters can express their views on Hitler's "bomb," but also dissolving the parliaments of the various states. However, new elections for the state parliaments may not be held. (Fourteenth dispatch from Reuters)</p>

<p>(London) Those who pay attention to the Far Eastern situation express the opinion that Germany's withdrawal from the League of Nations will further promote Japan's plan to build warships quickly and intensify the trend of Japan and Germany collaborating to resist the League of Nations. When Reuters reporters visited Japanese Ambassador to the UK Matsudaira today, he declined to comment on Japan's attitude towards Germany's withdrawal from the Disarmament Conference and the League of Nations, saying only that the news was very important.

<h3 id="e39">Core Members Meet in a Tense Atmosphere; Simon Delivers a Serious Speech <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) The core members of the Disarmament Conference met today in a very tense atmosphere. Many people attended the meeting. British Foreign Secretary Simon spoke, saying that the time for decorating difficult times with empty, optimistic words has passed. If the key points of the dispute are not addressed, endless discussions will not help.</p>
<h3 id="e40">Treaty Cannot Allow Rearmament <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>He believed that an agreement on a disarmament treaty cannot be established on the basis that any country is allowed to rearm. He did not want to debate whether it was reasonable or not to change the German army into a larger army with a shorter term of service and more equipment. However, at the beginning of the establishment of the treaty, there should be an agreement that the governments of various countries should not manufacture or re-equip any kind of weapons that may need to be abolished in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e41">Two Necessary Conditions for Disarmament <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>The British draft agreement unanimously adopted by the core members needs to be modified. After several discussions, it has been made clear that the term of the treaty can be extended from five years to eight years, and that a continuous procedure should be implemented during the term to achieve two necessary conditions, namely (1) disarmament special plans must be effectively completed by countries with abundant armaments, and (2) the principles of equality and security must be implemented. Politicians must deal with the reality of the instability in Europe, so the necessity of monitoring and gradual action must be clearly established. If the degree of disarmament of countries with abundant armaments is not completely sufficient, Britain cannot support this disarmament plan. The abolition of various armaments is tantamount to establishing a list of permissible weapons, which will be uniformly adopted by all countries. In this way, the different status of countries whose armaments are restricted by treaties can eventually be eliminated. In summary, this plan contains the principle that countries currently restricted by treaties should not increase their armaments, but must accept the timeline already explained. His clear wording is a clear declaration of British opinion.</p>
<h3 id="e42">France, the United States, and Italy All Speak in Favor <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>French Foreign Minister Poncet agreed with British Foreign Secretary Simon, and insisted on the necessity of managing German armaments, saying that this move is not only appropriate for the current political situation in Europe, but also requires a trial period. The purpose of the treaty is not to allow disarmed countries to rearm, but to reduce the armament standards of countries with abundant armaments to achieve equality.</p>
<p>US representative Davis strongly supported Simon's remarks, stating that the position adopted by the United States is that a disarmament treaty cannot be a tool for restoring armaments, but that seeking equality must be based on reducing the armaments of countries with abundant armaments, not on creating the armaments of other countries. Italian representative Salagrana also agreed with the remarks of the British Foreign Secretary.</p>
<p>German representative Heinbaden made a brief speech in a tense atmosphere, stating that Germany's attitude is based on two principles: first, the disarmament of countries with abundant armaments should begin immediately; second, equality between countries must be realized immediately. However, Germany is now prepared to negotiate on the amount of armaments it should have. (Fourteenth dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<p>(Geneva) British Foreign Secretary Simon spoke at the core committee of the Disarmament Conference, strongly opposing Germany's rearmament during the first phase of the Disarmament Treaty, and applying to other powerful armed countries to greatly reduce their armaments in the next eight years, so that Germany could be given equal rights, rather than realizing it by increasing Germany's armaments, it would be better to drastically reduce world armaments. Following this, US Ambassador Davis spoke, fully agreeing with the British government's view that the United States' position is that the Disarmament Treaty cannot be a tool for restoring armaments, but that seeking equality must be based on reducing the armaments of countries with abundant armaments, not on creating the armaments of other countries. Before Berlin declared its withdrawal from the Disarmament Conference today, US dignitaries told reporters that they believed the success or failure of the Disarmament Conference would depend on whether Germany could accept the British proposal. A spokesman for the British delegation also stated that the United States and Britain are in agreement on the entire disarmament issue, and that a resolution containing the principles stated by Simon will be submitted on Monday. In addition, it was heard that US Ambassador Davis also participated in the drafting of Simon's speech, which also shows the consistency of British and American opinions.</p>
<h3 id="e43">Three Key Points of the New British Proposal <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>The key points of British Foreign Secretary Simon's speech to the core committee are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The disarmament treaty should be extended to eight years.</p>
<p>(2) These eight years should be divided into two phases. The first phase, perhaps four years, will standardize European armies, and Germany will guarantee not to rearm. In the second phase, the major powers should roughly follow the British draft proposal to greatly reduce armaments and allow Germany the right to equip all non-abolished weapons. (3) Establish an appropriate supervisory system to monitor the implementation of treaty obligations. Simon also pointed out that after several weapons are abolished in the second phase, the result will be a public list of weapons that are allowed to be equipped, which will be the same for all countries, without any bias. Therefore, the discriminatory status of countries whose armaments are restricted by treaties will also be finally eliminated. He also said that the principle contained in this plan is that countries currently restricted by treaties should not start to increase their armaments, but should first express their willingness to abide by the aforementioned period. The British government believes that clauses that allow immediate rearmament cannot establish a basis for agreement or treaty.</p>
<p>Subsequently, French Foreign Minister Poncet made a brief speech, expressing France's substantive agreement with Foreign Secretary Simon's declaration, and repeatedly stated that, in view of the actual situation in Europe, it is necessary for this conference to formulate a period for managing armaments before starting disarmament. Italian representative Sulagna only thanked Foreign Secretary Simon's declaration. Although the wording of the representatives of France and Italy was ambiguous as to whether they agreed with Foreign Secretary Simon's declaration, US officials firmly stated that the four countries of Britain, France, Italy, and the United States had completely agreed on all general principles. As for the other representatives, they all directly stated that Foreign Secretary Simon's speech had completely isolated Germany.</p>

<p>Since the German chief representative Nattoni has returned to his country, Reinbebein stated that he will forward Simon's proposal to Berlin for a decision, and reiterated Germany's attitude, solemnly declaring that powerful armed countries must reduce armaments and allow Germany to have an equal position, and requested</p>
<p>(1) To first truly and substantially reduce armaments,</p>
<p>(2) In order to implement the principle of equality, both the question of quality and quantity should be left for long-term discussion,</p>
<p>In addition, the Belgian representative made a brief statement, generally supporting Simon's declaration. The Czech Foreign Minister stated that the General Committee cannot make any progress until several key points are resolved.</p>
<p>Chairman Henderson then announced that Simon's report would be submitted to the General Committee on Monday. (Fourteenth dispatch from the National Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Berlin) German Chief Representative Nattoni rushed back to Berlin from Geneva to discuss disarmament matters with Prime Minister Hitler. After the two met today, it has been decided not to make any further concessions in Geneva. The European capitals, due to Nattoni's firm attitude in Geneva, had long expected this decision. The German representative will take back to Geneva tomorrow formal instructions announcing that Germany will no longer make concessions. Today, Berlin issued a semi-official statement, criticizing treaty proposals that would abolish the principle of equality stipulated in the Five-Power Treaty, stating that when countries with strong armaments clearly refuse to take even the slightest steps towards disarmament, certain powerful countries are trying to establish a disarmament treaty, which is contrary to the principles of international politics. The German rulers are deeply apprehensive about the means that have created a very serious situation and will endanger the disarmament work. Only by acknowledging the demands for true universal disarmament and honest equality can disarmament work be successfully completed.</p>
<h3 id="e45">British, French, and American Resolutions Withdrawn <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>The major powers had originally planned to submit a resolution based on recent talks in Paris, but this plan has now been withdrawn, probably because they knew the attitude of the German authorities. If this case is hastily submitted, it may lead to the breakdown of the Disarmament Conference and Germany's withdrawal. However, the door to continued negotiations remains open, so it is not yet the end of the road.</p>
<h3 id="e46">The United States and Italy Have Exerted Efforts to Mediate <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>It is heard that German representative Reinbaden will declare at tomorrow's core committee meeting that the disarmament of countries with strong armaments must not be delayed, and that Germany's new army should be allowed to equip appropriate weapons. The Italian representative may support this claim, as Italian Prime Minister Mussolini is now in favor of giving Germany some satisfaction in terms of armaments. German chief representative Nattoni was very angry when he departed from Geneva to return to Berlin because the three countries of Britain, France, and the United States refused to allow Germany to rearm. Therefore, when he returns to Geneva in the future, he will ask the three countries to change their policies so as not to reduce his determination. It is heard that the Italian representative has informally suggested that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini mediate. Before Nattoni hurriedly returned to Berlin, he expressed Germany's opinion that the remaining powers are now trying to force Germany to submit. It is heard that the cancellation of the formal resolution based on discussions in Paris was mainly due to the efforts of US Chief Representative Davis. Although Davis advocates that Germany should not be forced to comply with the treaty policy, he still agrees with Britain and France that Germany cannot be allowed to rearm during the first phase of the disarmament plan.</p>
<p>London now expects that British Foreign Secretary Simon will deliver an important speech at tomorrow's core committee meeting, outlining the process of recent talks. This talk proves that the British government holds the opinion that Germany's immediate rearmament is not permissible, and that the disarmament process should be implemented in stages. France and the United States fully agree with this opinion. During the preparatory period, the monitoring of armaments and military spending will be implemented. According to sources in London, once this measure is implemented, after a certain period of time, it can enable countries with strong armaments to make solid disarmament, and Germany can also achieve equality in the weapons that are allowed to be equipped. British Foreign Secretary Simon visited the Italian Acting Chief Representative today. According to Geneva sources, Simon had informed him of the main points of his planned declaration.</p>

<p>At the same time, in Paris, Foreign Minister Poncet had a long talk with Prime Minister Daladier.

<p>(London) The Morning Post published an article in a prominent position today, linking the Western political crisis caused by Germany's efforts to avoid unilateral disarmament with the Eastern tense situation created by Japan and Russia, declaring that many people in the League of Nations in Geneva believe that war is inevitable, and that the League of Nations is encountering the most serious crisis in history. According to the newspaper's Geneva correspondent, detailed reports on the Japan-Russia issue are now being received one after another. Most people in the League of Nations believe that war between the two countries is inevitable.</p>

<p>It also said that Geneva is afraid that the day of a serious crisis is approaching. Although the correspondent did not explicitly say that the current situation is enough to brew a world war, he actually meant this. According to the report received in Geneva, the hope of reaching a compromise with the Germans on the armament issue has been abandoned. The tension in the Far Eastern situation also shows that a rupture between Japan and Russia is imminent. However, other newspaper correspondents in Geneva are not so pessimistic and have rarely discussed the Far Eastern issue. Most people believe that although the disarmament situation is serious, there is still hope for a compromise. A certain correspondent stated that Germany has a new informal proposal: if other countries reduce armaments, Germany can agree not to increase its military strength.</p>

<p>It is also said that Berlin, Rome, and Geneva are currently engaged in intense communication via telegram in a final effort to resolve the disarmament issue. Italian leader Mussolini is attempting to persuade representatives of other countries to come to Rome to discuss the matter, but as of this morning, he has not succeeded. The General Disarmament Commission is scheduled to formally convene on Monday, but correspondents generally believe that after a brief meeting, it will adjourn to continue private talks. However, it is feared that these talks will yield little results unless the Germans make some concessions in many areas and agree not to rearm for the time being. (National Telegram, 14th)</p>

<p>(Berlin) The German government issued a statement to the nation, the main points of which were already seen in Hitler's personal declaration. It stated that the German government and people unanimously adopt a policy of peace and reject violence, because violence is not an appropriate means of resolving existing disputes. Germany is extremely willing to accept any genuine disarmament. Germany is prepared to destroy its last machine gun and disband its last soldier, provided that other countries do the same. The German people unanimously want to resolve difficulties through negotiations with other countries, and even with former enemy countries, they do not harbor past grudges. In order to achieve sincere relations with other countries, Germany is prepared to conclude non-aggression pacts at any time to guarantee lasting peace in Europe. However, the German people and government have the same sense of honor and feel that the necessary condition for participating in such pacts is the granting of equality to Germany. Therefore, the government and people have unanimously decided to withdraw from the Disarmament Conference and the League of Nations until Germany obtains such genuine equality. The statement concludes by asking the German people whether they support the government's policy and whether they are prepared to promote it, as an expression of public opinion.

<p>(Tokyo) The Foreign Ministry spokesman spoke today about the Soviet Union's release of the so-called Hishikari documents, saying that Japan will resolutely deal with any tricks Russia plays in the Sino-Eastern Railway issue. The Soviet Union forged the so-called Japanese plan to seize the Sino-Eastern Railway, apparently intending to win the sympathy of various countries while dividing the opinions of moderate and radical factions in Japan. However, both of these goals have failed, because the world's reaction is very unfavorable to Russia, and even the moderate elements in Japan have strengthened their attitude towards Russia as a result. Japan believes that the Sino-Eastern Railway issue is completely unrelated to the Tokyo conference on the sale of the Sino-Eastern Railway, but the Soviet Union says that the two cannot be separated, so it refuses to continue the conference. The Sino-Eastern Railway issue arose before the creation of "Manchukuo." If the Soviet Union insists on its attitude and causes the Tokyo conference to fail, then the responsibility should be borne by the Soviet Union. The spokesman also said that the Soviet Union's unholy plan has now failed. (Reuters News Agency Telegram, 14th)</p>

<p>According to a Toho newspaper dispatch from Shenyang, a recent fact is enough to confirm the activeness of the Soviet Union's Far East military preparations and the tension of the United States' Pacific policy. Recently in the Far East, especially in Manchuria, spy groups from certain three countries have been discovered engaging in secret activities using all possible means, making the authorities extremely nervous. According to reconnaissance in Shenyang, the spy groups from these three countries seem to first win over local Japanese or "Manchukuo" people to act as their vanguard. They frequently engage in wireless communication using the commercial offices or residences of their own nationals in the commercial districts. Based on this communication network, they have established a dense spy network throughout Manchuria, collecting intelligence and secretly reporting to their own governments. Moreover, they seem to be fabricating various pieces of information that could put Japan and "Manchukuo" at an international disadvantage. The Manchurian authorities are seriously concerned about this. (World News Agency)</p>

<p>(Zhenjiang) At 9:00 AM on the 14th, all circles of Jiangsu Province held a grand meeting in the auditorium of the provincial party headquarters to welcome Chairman Chen and the heads of various departments and committees, and issued a welcome declaration with four hopes: (1) Dredge rivers, develop water conservancy, open up highways, complete the highway network in various counties, and facilitate transportation; (2) Appoint incorruptible officials, eradicate malpractices, use every penny for the public good, break through personal connections in administrative matters, and eliminate redundant personnel; (3) First determine the county administration system, consolidate the administrative foundation of various counties, and be cautious in selecting personnel for autonomous work; (4) Hope that Committee Member Wang Boling will take more responsibility in terms of public security so that the lives and property of the people of Jiangsu can be effectively protected. In addition, more than 3,000 representatives from various trade associations, institutions, schools, and groups were chaired by Bao Mingshu, representing the press association, and delivered speeches (same as the declaration). Chairman Chen then replied, saying that although Jiangsu Province has undergone considerable construction in recent years, the rural economy has declined, the suffering of farmers has increased day by day, and the future is very dangerous, such as the silk problem in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, the water conservancy problem in northern Jiangsu, and the diversion of the Huai River in northern Jiangsu. The central government can allocate 9 million yuan. In the future, if successful, the rural economy of northern Jiangsu will naturally increase. To purify the administration, the people must implement supervision. His colleagues came to Jiangsu to (1) "Maintain" how to improve local security so that people can live and work in peace, (2) "Nurture" how to cultivate the people's wealth so that the region is evenly developed and prosperous, (3) "Educate" how to instill knowledge in the people and receive appropriate education to become good citizens. He hoped to do the above three points and not disappoint everyone's expectations. However, expectations should not be too high or too fast. His colleagues should proceed with enthusiasm and consideration of the priority of things to realize them. The meeting was adjourned after taking photos at noon.

However, Arabs hate the return of Jews to their homeland, claiming that the current economic situation is already extremely difficult.

<h3 id="e103">Contents of Technical Cooperation between the League of Nations and China—The League of Nations Sends Personnel to Assist Based on International Principles—Official Records of the League of Nations Information Department— <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>The League of Nations Information Department reported that all members of the League of Nations passed a report at the Parliamentary General Assembly in February of this year, which was later approved by the United States. It stated that "for the sake of world peace and the interests of all countries, the Chinese government should be supported so that it can realize its national aspirations." Currently, the League of Nations is acting in accordance with this report. The report mentioned that this move should expand the plan for technical meetings with the League of Nations, which began in May 1931. In June of this year, the Chinese government sent a letter to the Executive Yuan of the League of Nations, proposing the expansion of technical cooperation projects and their nature and outline. The letter strongly stated the valuable assistance that the League of Nations has already provided. The letter informed the Executive Yuan that the preliminary investigation work has now been completed. The National Government, in view of the resources it controls, has decided to start implementing its national key projects in several provinces as a model for other regions of the country. This work requires the continued efforts of all relevant parties and the coordination of various related activities. If the Executive Yuan can maintain the cooperation between the League of Nations and the National Government at this time to help its reconstruction, especially by appointing a technician to serve as an advisor to the National Government and its National Economic Council, the National Government will be deeply grateful.</p>
<p>The Executive Yuan then selected a committee from its members, including its acting chairman (Mexico) and representatives from China, Czechoslovakia, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Spain, and the United Kingdom. The committee met in Paris on July 18 and elected Dr. Rajchman, Minister of Health of the League of Nations, as the aforementioned technician for a term of one year. It also stated that the principle of the cooperation plan is purely technical, fair, and non-political, with the broadest international foundation as its purpose.</p>
<p>The technician's responsibilities are as follows: Based on the above principles, he will serve as a liaison between the National Economic Council of China and the relevant agencies of the League of Nations, provide China with technical information from the technical organizations of the League of Nations that is beneficial to China's reconstruction, notify the Secretariat of the League of Nations of any requests for technical cooperation from the Chinese government so that they can be forwarded to the relevant technical agencies, help introduce specialized talents so that the Chinese government can take the initiative to hire them, support the activities of the League of Nations experts in China, and report the progress of his (technician's) mission to the Executive Yuan at any time, and submit a detailed report every three months. Another copy should be sent to the relevant technical agencies. The technician shall request the assistance of the Secretariat of the League of Nations to forward requests to the technical agencies when he needs to inquire about anything in the performance of his duties. Any information or reports submitted by the technician to the League of Nations shall be copied and sent to the National Economic Council of China for reference at the same time.</p>
<p>The committee has written to the Executive Yuan, stating that if the Chinese government raises any questions to the Executive Yuan regarding technical cooperation, the Executive Yuan must consider them, and the Executive Yuan must review the information and reports sent by the technician. The committee can provide consultations to the Executive Yuan at any time when any questions arise regarding the technician's mission. (Translated by the World Society)</p>
<p>An Account of the Perils of the Bandit Disaster in Luandong (Part 2)</p>
<h3 id="e104">The Dispersion of Pacified Bandits and the Conspiracy to Flee Westward <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>It has been half a month since Fu Ning was occupied by bandits. The personal desires of the bandits have been satisfied, so quite a few people have taken the opportunity to wash their hands. Moreover, since they have solved their own economic problems, most of them are unwilling to risk their lives for others. As a result, the more than 1,000 bandits who invaded Fu Ning have gradually dispersed, leaving only more than 400 people. These more than 400 bandits are stationed in the city during the day and scattered in the Zijing Mountain in the south of the city at night to prevent attacks by our security team. Until recently, the bandits planned to flee westward again, so a certain number of about 500 people mixed into Fu Ning City. As of October 9, the number of bandits in the city has increased to more than 1,000. The people of Fu Ning have suffered so much from the ravages of the bandits that they have pooled 2,000 yuan to hire a Japanese person to serve as a bodyguard. Whenever bandits come to extort or plunder, the Japanese person is responsible for resisting them. The bandits see that he is Japanese, laugh, and leave. It is now reported that the bandits in Fu Ning are planning to coordinate with the bandits on the Beidaihe coast to advance. Their plan to flee is divided into two routes. One route is to advance from the northeast of Changli. This plan has been exposed by our security team. Previously, the bandits had twice invaded Lianggezhuang. The first day was led by Rong Shan, with a total of four groups: Si Haijiao, Er Long, Er Long, and Song Ziwen. The second day, Si Haijiao was again the vanguard, carrying out the invasion. The bandits had previously learned that there were very few of our security team stationed in Lianggezhuang. However, before the bandits advanced, our reinforcements had arrived. Once they came into contact, the bandits were defeated and retreated. After being pursued, the bandits collapsed. The bandit leader Si Haijiao was also killed. The bandits on the northeast route suffered a severe blow, and their vitality was greatly damaged. As a result, there is no trace of bandits on the south bank of the Yang River. One route is to advance from the southeast, which is still in the planning stage. There are currently about 600 bandits gathered on the Beidaihe coast. They are attempting to attack along the railway line. Our security team has established a solid police force on the southeast route. It is heard that the bandits are determined to invade Changli this time and are deeply resentful of the repeated attacks by the security team. Therefore, they have been increasing the number of bandits in recent days, intending to make a final desperate effort with all their strength. Although our security team is composed of elite members, the disparity in numbers is too great. Prevention may be possible for a while, but if reinforcements are delayed, it is feared that it will be difficult to imagine. Therefore, the people of Luandong are eager for the newly formed security team to open to the east, like a great drought looking forward to rain clouds.</p>

<p>After the bandits occupied Fu Ning, the residents of the city and suburbs all fled one after another, carrying the old and supporting the young. The destinations of the escapees are Qin Huangdao and Changli. Qin Huangdao now has more than 30,000 refugees gathered, displaced in the wilderness, a tragic sight to behold. Moreover, at this time in late autumn, they have no food or clothing and can only wait to die. Changli currently has more than 5,000 refugees, some of whom are being taken in and rescued by the Xingzhong Company, while others are also displaced in the wilderness and no one cares about them. The Beidaihe coast has about 20,000 refugees gathered. In other places such as Yu Guan Town, the number of refugees is countless. Although it is now the time for the war zone emergency relief team to provide relief, it cannot save these refugees from their dire situation. Moreover, the refugees' family property has long been looted by the bandits, and their future livelihoods have been cut off. To talk about relief, it is necessary to find fundamental solutions for them. Otherwise, if it is delayed until the middle of winter, if the refugees are forced into detours due to livelihood pressures, it will affect the overall situation in Luandong, which is no small matter.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Dou Xizhe is Willing to Live and Die with Changli <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Dou Xizhe, the commander of the Hebei Provincial Security Corps, leads 2,000 strong men to support the precarious situation in Luandong. Being able to protect Changli today is truly a testament to his hard work. The reporter visited Dou several times in Changli. Every time we talked, Dou was so excited that he shed tears. According to Dou, "The security team currently has only more than 2,000 people, distributed in various places in Luandong. The battle of Fu Ning was actually forced to retreat due to the constraints of the rear. I have no regrets in my heart for the elders of Luandong. Now that Fu Ning is no longer defended, the relationship with Changli is not comparable to Fu Ning. Changli is the throat of Yutian, Lulong, and Leting counties. I am determined to deal with everything with all my strength. As for my personal life and death, I have long put it aside. I am willing to live and die with Changli City. Moreover, I will never be forced by any threats. My subordinates have also made vows of 'either bandits or me' and 'either me or no bandits.' Now that Changli is surrounded by bandits, I am confident that with the well-trained police force, dealing with the rabble of bandits, even if the number of bandits is several times greater than ours, it will not be difficult to defeat them. I originally intended to take advantage of the westward fleeing of the bandits and launch a head-on attack until Fu Ning was recovered. However, Changli's relationship is important. If a large force enters Fu Ning, and the rear of Changli is scattered in strength and re-entered by the bandits, the overall situation in Luandong will be impossible to clean up. Therefore, I am currently devoting all my efforts to protecting Changli, and will plan to recover Fu Ning after the reinforcements arrive. Moreover, solid defensive works have been set up on the east, south, and north sides of the suburbs of Changli. If the bandits come to invade, there are ways to deal with them. The current situation in Luandong is quite complicated. The bandit disaster in Luandong is rampant, and there are certain constraints in western Luandong, placing me in a state of siege on all sides, which is quite difficult. However, since I am responsible for defending the territory, I can only swallow my tears and do my best. As for the merits and demerits, I can only leave it to fate." (10th)</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang's National Day Commemorative Speech</p>
<h3 id="e107">Only by Cultivating a Spirit of Propriety, Righteousness, Integrity, and Shame Can the Suppression of Bandits and Resistance Against Japan Not Become a Problem <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>A Nanjing dispatch reported that the Jiangxi Provincial National Day Commemorative Party and government agencies held a joint meeting. The attendees included all members of the Provincial Party Department, all members of the Provincial Government, officers above the rank of section chief of the headquarters, and more than 2,000 representatives from various agencies, groups, and schools, who gathered in the auditorium of the Provincial Party Department. The Provincial Government Guard was responsible for guarding the surrounding area. At 10:10 AM, Chairman Chiang also arrived. Chairman Xiong of the Provincial Government and Director He of the headquarters followed behind. After the meeting and salute were held as usual, Chiang delivered a speech, which is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>"Fellow comrades, today is the National Day of the Republic of China in the 22nd year. It has been 22 years since the Republic of China. Our Premier and martyrs sacrificed themselves for the revolution, for the creation of the Republic of China, and for the realization of our party's doctrine. And later, in the suppression of traitors and bandits, many comrades of our party also sacrificed their lives and the production of all the people. Especially the turmoil of bandits in Jiangxi made it impossible for the people to live and work in peace. Our Premier and martyrs in heaven must be uneasy, and the comrades of our party and the military and political personnel in office should feel very uneasy. Regarding the National Day commemoration, in foreign countries, it is a grand celebration day. It is truly a national celebration and a great honor. But although our Republic of China has grown to 22 years old, it is like a person. The Premier is so old and should have the ability to be self-reliant and self-defensive and not allow foreign insults. But now there is internal turmoil from bandits and external aggression from imperialists. We in-service personnel, on this National Day, looking back at the difficulty of the Premier's creation of the Republic of China and the sacrifices of the martyrs who created the Republic of China, only feel frightened and infinitely ashamed. We are sorry for the Premier and the martyrs in heaven. My personal feelings are like this, and I believe everyone's feelings are the same. Today, I have a few opinions to offer to everyone. A country must have a soul in order to survive, be sound, and stable. What is a soul? For example, if a person's body grows up but has no soul, he will only become a clay sculpture or wooden puppet. Today's China is like this. Although it has grown into a big man, is strong, independent, and has all kinds of skills, intelligence, and learning, it only lacks a soul. In the 22 years since the founding of the Republic of China, from 15 to 20 years, there has been a lot of glorious history, but after that, it has been in tragedy, pain, and danger every day. Now it is even more dangerous. The Premier and the martyrs entrusted the difficult-to-create Republic of China to us. We comrades who have died and not yet died cannot continue to promote and develop it in order to comfort the souls of the Premier and the martyrs in heaven. We ask ourselves, can we not be ashamed? In the future, if we want to continue to promote and develop the glorious history of the martyrs, we must first enrich the soul of the country. What is the soul of China? It is the Three Principles of the People. What is the important part of the Three Principles of the People? It is the eight characters "loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, faith, righteousness, and peace" that the Premier said. It should be known that China has reached the 22nd year and is a good youth. He should be able to inherit the cause of his parents and ancestors. Now, not only can he not be independent, but he is also oppressed by foreign insults. The territory is being eroded day by day, and the people are suffering every day. The future is so dangerous. What is the reason? Because although people have grown up and have all kinds of skills, intelligence, and learning, they lack loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, faith, righteousness, and peace. This is a big problem. The reason why China has become what it is now is because it is only hanging a sign of the Republic of China without obtaining the spirit of the Republic of China. If we want to obtain the spirit of the Republic of China, we must do the eight characters of loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, faith, righteousness, and peace that the Premier said. Now, I will change the eight characters into four characters, which are propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame. It should be known that a nation cannot be established without morality. The comrades of our party and all the personnel in office have more than enough ability, intelligence, talent, and learning compared with foreigners. What is lacking is the four characters of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame. All in-service personnel are responsible for the rise and fall of the nation. If we want to revitalize China and comfort the souls of the Premier and the martyrs in heaven, we must start with the four characters of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame in today's National Day commemoration, set an example for the people, and be a model for the people. If all the in-service personnel cannot achieve propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame, then China will only sink forever and will not stop until it is destroyed. I hope everyone will abide by this righteousness and lay the foundation for revitalizing China and consolidating the nation. Talking about the four characters of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame is not something that can be done by talking about it, nor can it be done by writing a few sentences. It must be done in practice. If we want to do it in practice, we must understand what propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame are. As far as propriety is concerned, what is propriety? The ancients said, "If a person has no propriety, he cannot be a human being." From this, we can see the importance of propriety. In other words, if a country has no propriety, it cannot become a country. The national difficulties, bandit disasters, and people's suffering in China today can mostly be blamed on not knowing propriety. For example, during the Premier's memorial week, we must bow three times and salute the national flag and party flag. What does this mean? Does everyone know? If you don't know, then bowing three times at random is meaningless. If there is no meaning, there is no feeling. Today, I will explain it. I hope everyone will go back and explain it to those who have not been here to make it universal, especially those in the education sector. Elementary school teachers should be especially clear. On the first day of school, we must tell the students that the national flag and party flag are where the souls of the Premier and the martyrs are entrusted. We salute the party flag and national flag because there are souls of martyrs on them, not random salutes. Not only must we salute, but we must also protect and cherish them. Foreign countries regard the national flag as a representative of the country. If someone insults his national flag, he is insulting his entire country. Looking back at our countrymen, do we have such feelings? We hang the national flag casually and messily without respect, love, or care. If we do not respect and love the national flag, we do not know how to respect and love the country. From now on, everyone must know the importance of the national flag. If you don't know, you are not worthy to be a citizen of the Republic of China, especially elementary school teachers. We must explain it to the students so that we don't always create students who don't love the country or the party. Of course, we won't have any feelings about any commemoration. How can the country be sound? If we can make everyone understand the meaning of saluting the national flag and party flag, then we will know how to cherish, protect, and respect them and generate feelings for the nation and the country. We won't bow casually anymore. The party flag has two meanings: the blue sky and white sun. The national flag has three meanings: the blue sky, white sun, and red earth. This is what everyone knows. Why does the national flag have three meanings? This is also what everyone should know, because it is the representative of our country. We make a living under it. If there is no national flag, everyone will be slaves of a conquered nation. The two colors of the national flag are blue sky, white sun, and red earth. The red is blood, the blood that the martyrs sacrificed to create the revolution, establish the Republic of China, and sacrifice for the country and the people. That is why their souls are entrusted on it. The blue sky and white sun are twelve rays of light. The twelve rays of light represent the twelve hours of the day: Zi, Chou, Yin, Mao, Chen, Si, Wu, Wei, Shen, You, Xu, Hai. It means that it is bright and upright, causing people to think about it for thousands of years. The comrades of our party take the sacrifice of themselves to save the country and the people as their purpose, and only then can they live up to the four words of uprightness and brightness. Blue represents the sky. The sky is supreme. Only the nature of our party is for the entire nation and country, selfless, and supreme. White means purity and flawless, which means that our revolutionary comrades must have a pure heart and spirit and morality, just like a piece of jade, pure and flawless. This is also what only the comrades of our party can afford. In the future, all of you, especially the in-service government and military personnel, must have a pure heart, noble character, and ambition to sacrifice for the country and the people. You must sprinkle your blood on the national flag and entrust your souls on the national flag and party flag. In today's National Day, saluting the Premier's portrait and the party and national flags has such a meaning. Propriety must be in accordance with righteousness. Propriety without righteousness cannot be propriety. Therefore, propriety cannot be done casually and cannot be easily talked about. Everyone must pay attention to this so that the country can be stable. If we want to have a sound country, we must start with elementary school students and continue until death. If we want to suppress bandits and resist foreign insults, we cannot just rely on the army. We must rely on the four characters of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame. Today, in commemorating the National Day, we should use propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame to lay the foundation of the country. We should start with Jiangxi. If Jiangxi is secured, then we can eliminate the bandits. If the bandits are eliminated, then we can stabilize the people's hearts. If the people's hearts are stabilized, then the Republic of China can be consolidated. If you can set an example and popularize it among your friends and comrades to cultivate a spirit of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame, then not only can the bandits be completely eliminated, but I also believe that we can be restored to a country of propriety and righteousness. Then, if we promote and popularize it throughout China as a country of propriety and righteousness, then suppressing bandits and resisting Japan will not become a problem. Finally, I hope that everyone will start with the Premier and the party and national flags in today's National Day commemoration, starting with yourselves and then others, to revitalize China and comfort the souls of the Premier and the martyrs in heaven. At the same time, I encourage everyone to achieve their own great cause."</p>
<p>After Chiang finished his speech, he shouted slogans: (1) The National Day commemoration is a commemoration of our party's creation of the Republic of China. (2) To commemorate the National Day, we must eliminate the bandits. (3) To commemorate the National Day, we must work hard to resist Japan. (4) Support the government, implement unity, and ensure peace and unification. (5) Long live the Chinese Kuomintang. (6) Long live the Three Principles of the People. (7) Long live the Republic of China. After shouting, he took photos in the garden outside the hall. First, Chairman Chiang took photos alone, and then all the attendees took photos together. The meeting adjourned at about 12:00 noon. (Datong Society)</p>

<p>Zhang Yilin and thirteen others from Jiangsu sent a telegram to the new Jiangsu Provincial Government Chairman Chen Guofu and others on the 13th: "To Chairman Chen, Director Gu of the Civil Affairs Department, and Director Zhao of the Finance Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Government in Zhenjiang. We have heard about your appointment and are all very excited. We believe that your new plans will satisfy the public's expectations and reach the highest level of governance. Jiangsu Province has suffered from repeated floods, war disasters, and low grain prices that have harmed farmers. Farmers work hard all year round but cannot get enough to eat. Women seek employment in cities, and strong men leave their villages. Land is barren and neglected, and the people are deeply impoverished. We know that you have already considered how to cultivate and comfort them, and we don't need to worry too much. However, we want to say that the provincial treasury is extremely depleted, and there are all kinds of construction projects. There is no inexhaustible source, so we must first reduce unnecessary expenses. We must plan and discuss with the public in a comprehensive manner so that donations can be used for urgent needs, and both can be achieved. We hope that the wise and bright officials will listen to good advice and cultivate the national foundation, soothe the people's breath, and always remember the mulberry tree's suffering, and also adopt the words of the common people. We ask that you distinguish between how to help rural areas, develop production, and abolish policies that severely burden the people, so that your virtuous voice will be spread and we will see thunderous cheers. We respectfully offer our humble opinions and hope that you will accept them. We are extremely fortunate. Zhang Yilin, Fei Shuwei, Jin Tianhe, Zeng Pu, Zhao Yichen, Ding Huaiqing, Qian Ding, Shen Shaozeng kowtow. Zhang Yilin and others also sent a telegram to former Chairman Gu Zhutong and others: "To Chairman Gu of the Zhenjiang Provincial Government, Director Zhao of the Civil Affairs Department, and Director Shu of the Finance Department. When you took over the Jiangsu government, it was after floods and war disasters. The provincial treasury was extremely depleted, and the rural areas were on the verge of bankruptcy. Fortunately, you were wise and understood the people's concerns. Therefore, although the two proposals on grain transport reduction, special characteristics, permanent tenancy, and taxation were once considered, they were eventually exempted or postponed due to public opinion. The people all understand that the provincial government above is considering the national economy and below is relieving the people's breath, with the painstaking efforts of considering both, and not exploiting the people for political purposes. Now that we hear that you are leaving Jiangsu, our love and respect are deep. There is no way to keep you, and we are frightened and worried that the previous achievements will not be completed and that there will be changes in the future. Therefore, we send a telegram again, begging you to specially transfer the archives of the two proposals so that we can obtain a deep and solid guarantee and leave a glimmer of hope for the revival of rural areas. We are extremely fortunate. Zhang Yilin, Fei Shuwei, Jin Tianhe, Zeng Pu, Zhao Yichen kowtow."</p>

<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: After assuming the position of committee member of the Southwest Political Affairs Council, Li Zongren, commander-in-chief of the Fourth Army Group of Guangxi, spent most of his time in Guangdong. Recently, to discuss the current situation and reorganize the military and political affairs of Guangxi Province, he returned to Guangxi from Guangdong on the morning of October 3. Accompanying him were his wife, Guo Dejie, and over twenty adjutants and guards. Before leaving, he requested a one-month leave from the Southwest Political Affairs Council, promising to return to Guangdong as soon as the military and political affairs of Guangxi Province were settled. On the afternoon of the 3rd, Li arrived at Hekou by Guangsan train and transferred by steamer to Wu. He arrived in Wuzhou at 8 a.m. on the 4th. Bai Chongxi, who was on an inspection tour to Xunzhou, went to Wuzhou to greet Li upon hearing of his arrival. Bai and Li stayed in Wuzhou for one night. On the 5th, they went west together and arrived in Nanning on the afternoon of the 6th. It is reported that Li's most important task this time is to discuss the current situation with Bai Chongxi and the generals of Guangxi Province. He will also inspect the troops of Guangxi Province and inspect the defenses of various places. There will also be some reforms in military and political affairs. A military conference may be held in Yong. It was rumored a few days ago that the troops of Guangxi Province were being reorganized. According to Bai Chongxi's opinion, it is planned to reorganize the entire Guangxi military strength into sixteen regiments, abolish the military adjustment, and change to using the division as a unit. Guangxi will be temporarily reorganized into five divisions, each division commanding three regiments and one artillery regiment. Each division and regimental headquarters will have special troops such as special service companies and platoons. The entire Guangxi will be reorganized into approximately twenty-two regiments. As for the militia in various counties, they have been actively trained. Those who have been trained to maturity have about 150,000 militias or more. Those who have been organized into standing teams are about 240 teams, with more than 120 militiamen in each team, totaling about 30,000 people. These militias are all under the command of the county government. Because they are well-trained, regardless of whether they are formal defense forces, Li and Bai believe that this militia has a certain scale and the local self-defense force is sufficient. Therefore, the active army is temporarily reduced to save military expenses. At the same time, the surplus military expenses will be used to expand the air force. The Guangxi Air Force is also quite impressive. At the aviation memorial meeting held in Guangdong Province a few days ago, Guangxi Province also had ten planes participating in the flight to Guangdong. Currently, in addition to raising funds to purchase airplanes, the training of flight personnel is being stepped up and the overall plan for the Guangxi Air Force is being implemented, designating seven locations, including Nanning, Longzhou, Bose, Guilin, Yulin, Hexian, and Wuzhou, as air force districts in the province, with Liuzhou as the air force headquarters. Each air force district has a flying field to achieve the effect of liaison and command. Some of the above-mentioned matters have already been carried out, and some are still awaiting planning. Therefore, Li Zongren's return to Guangxi this time is for planning and preparation. (October 9)</p>

<p>Liu Chunlan, director of the 9th branch of the Public Security Bureau, received a secret report on the evening of the day before yesterday at 11 p.m. saying that someone in the Bai Xun Nunnery in Daishang Village, Fourth District, was gathering people for gambling under the guise of storytelling. Please investigate and arrest them. Director Liu immediately led police officers to surround the nunnery and ordered the police officers to knock on the door to enter and arrest the gamblers. At that time, a villager, Gu Zhongxiang, took the opportunity to escape from the back door into the river. Unexpectedly, he did not know how to swim, and he floated and sank in the water. Director Liu had already arrested seven gamblers and sent them to the 9th branch for interrogation. After the police officers left, the villagers gathered to rescue him. However, Gu died of suffocation due to excessive water absorption. The next morning, Gu's wife, Ms. Lu, heard the news and rushed to the scene, wailing while holding the body. At the same time, villager Wu Genshou also drowned in the river at the same place. Zhu, the district chief of the district, instructed the head of the Tuanding, Miao Yugui, to report to the county court yesterday (the 14th) and request that someone be sent for an autopsy. The prosecutor, Ren, led the coroner, Wang, to the scene for an autopsy and determined that he had fallen into the river and died. The family of the deceased was ordered to prepare a coffin for burial and await verification. In addition, Zhang Renjin, a villager in Xiaxiaoqiao, Liuliutu, Jingyun City, Second District of the county, 32 years old, was a bowl repairer. On the 26th of last month, Zhang went out again with his burden. On the evening of the 11th of this month, in Dazhuzhuang, Wuwujiu Tu, in the same district, he was suddenly beaten to death by villagers Zhu Quangen and others. Afterwards, the body was moved to the side of the Huasifang tomb beside the railway in Liuliuliu Tu in the same district. Shao Yueji, the head of the Tu, discovered it the day before yesterday and immediately reported it to the county court. Prosecutor Shen led officials to the countryside for an autopsy. The autopsy revealed that the deceased had a fatal wound on the back of his head caused by a wooden object, and there were rope marks on both hands. He had been beaten to death before his death. Because no family members were found, Tu Zheng was ordered to prepare a coffin for burial. Yesterday morning (the 14th), the deceased's wife, Zhang Wu, heard the news and came to the city, requesting the prosecutor's office to arrest the murderer and bring him to justice.</p>

<p>At about 10 a.m. on the 11th of this month, a single traveler arrived at the Wuxi Hotel under the Gonglian Bridge in this city, creating the name Shen Chen, a native of Shanghai, 24 years old, wearing a Zhongshan style student uniform and carrying a small leather bag. He booked room 72 on the third floor. He did not go out that day. At about 9 p.m., he turned off the lights and went to bed. He got up at 8 a.m. the next morning and went out once. At 2 p.m., he returned to his room and asked the tea room for ink, paper, and writing materials, and then swallowed sleeping pills to commit suicide. At about 4 p.m. yesterday, the medicine took effect. Yuan Fupei, the tea room attendant, heard the groans, entered the room, and saw that his face was pale. He asked him, but he did not answer. He knew that he had taken poison. He then found a bottle of sleeping pills and four suicide notes on the table, and a photo of a girl about 18 or 19 years old in a small leather bag, with the words "No. 61, First Hostel, North Station" and "Lingzeng Memorial" written on the back. He immediately reported it to the manager, Wu Weichu, and reported it to the Second Branch, sending Shen Chen to Tongren Hospital for treatment. The doctor at the hospital washed his stomach and gave him an injection, and he was revived. After repeated inquiries by Tang, the patrol chief of the Second Branch, the teenager's reason for suicide was said to be caused by a bad environment, and he absolutely denied that it was for love.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Labor Unrest in the Barber Industry Expands <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>The barber industry in this city consists of small shops with a shortage of capital. Recently, due to the sluggish business, price reductions have been implemented to attract customers, which has affected the income of the shop assistants. Strikes have occurred in barber shops around Zhoushanbang. Later, members of the county party department, together with members of the industry association, went to various places to order the removal of the price reduction notices. The police of the Second Branch of the Public Security Bureau arrested Sha Laoer, the owner of Shanrongxuan, and Liu Dabang of Meihua Store, who were the first to reduce prices. They were released on bail. After being released from the bureau, Sha and Liu believed that the small shops mainly served farmers and workers and were affected by the large shops. The price reduction of the small shops was actually due to the problem of eating and was forced by the environment. The shop assistants were quite dissatisfied. At 2 p.m. on the day before yesterday, they sent representatives holding red flags to notify the barber shops inside and outside the city to continue the strike. At about 8 p.m., more than 100 striking workers flocked to the Meirongxuan and Meihua barber shops to question them. In case of disagreement, they took action and destroyed all the shop's belongings. Later, the police of the Second Branch arrested thirteen people, including Ju Changxing, Zhang Yongbao, Qian Baohua, and Yunlong, who had caused the incident, and brought them to the bureau along with Sha Laoer and Liu Dabang. The acting director of the branch, Cheng, held a court session for preliminary interrogation. Ju Changxing directly admitted to the destruction. Director Cheng, after hearing the confession, transferred all the arrested criminals to the headquarters for interrogation at 10 a.m. yesterday (the 14th). At the same time, the Inspection Department of the County Public Security Bureau and the Police Brigade immediately dispatched patrol teams to assist the Second Branch in maintaining order on the streets to prevent accidents. It is unknown how the strike will be resolved.</p>

<p>The Wu County Trade Associations have been organized and established and have now expired. The Chamber of Commerce has issued a notice that they should be completely re-elected or reorganized within one month. Therefore, the various trade associations have recently been following the procedures. The results of the re-election of the Southern Goods Industry are: Chao Rongzu was elected as the Standing Chairman, Lin Yibao of the Bean Industry was elected as the Chairman, and Chen Wenqi of the Rice Industry was elected as the Standing Chairman. The Dyeing Industry will be re-elected today (the 14th), and the Dyeing and Weaving Factory Industry will be re-elected on the 15th. However, the Money Industry has closed down many companies this year, and there are only six remaining. According to the association's organizational regulations, at least seven companies are required to organize, so it is fundamentally difficult to establish. The Silk and Cloth Industry was ordered to disband due to the problem of enemy goods and is currently preparing for reorganization. Once the various trade associations have been completely re-elected or organized, the re-election of the Chamber of Commerce will be carried out.</p>

<h3 id="e120">What Was Heard After the Fierce Battle Between Police and Bandits <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The situation of the fierce battle between the police and bandits in the Shenxiangdang, Jiashan County, was reported in yesterday's newspaper. It has been learned that the bandit gang is the Pudong Gang, which has always been rampant and has committed numerous crimes in the villages along the borders of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. This time, they robbed the Jiashan Tiande Medicine Shop and the boats carrying rice, and the peasant Yu was learned by Gao Zengzhi, the leader of the Jiadiao Security Corps Base Team, who led 18 team members and militiamen to suppress them. Unexpectedly, the bandits learned of the news and ambushed in the bamboo forest behind Zhoujiacao Village in the north of Shenxiangdang and launched a surprise attack, resulting in the complete annihilation of the Security Corps, resulting in an unprecedented tragedy. It is estimated that Lu Zijia, Hu Changfa, Shen Ziren, Chen Zhiwen, Ma Bingsheng, etc. died, and the rest were seriously injured and in critical condition. All the guns and boats were lost, and more than 1,600 bullets were lost. The county Security Corps and the Water and Land Police Brigade, led by Huang Ribin, the captain of the Yiwei warship, advanced to suppress them and are currently engaged in fierce battles near Dajinze. The families of the deceased knelt before the district regiment leader and the police brigade commander, begging for redress with cries of sorrow, which made those who heard it shed tears. Some even witnessed the bodies with bullet marks all over them, and they cried and jumped into the river to seek death. Moreover, they are all extremely poor and cannot afford coffins. As for Hu Changfa, he was originally from Anhui, and he was alone, which made the situation even more bleak and unspeakable. The county magistrate, Huang, urgently telegraphed the Security Department to implement condolences. The provincial authorities were very concerned after receiving the report of the tragedy and discussed suppression day and night in order to eliminate them in one fell swoop. Otherwise, the bandits would become more daring and the flames of robbery would become more intense, and the northwestern regions would become bandit areas.</p>

<p>The garrisons in the ports along the Yangtze River in Tongtai often had disputes over the inspection of foreign ships for opium. The Administrative Inspector of the Seventh District has now received an order from the Provincial Government transferred from the Executive Yuan that, after the inspection of foreign ships for smuggling opium and its substitutes, before the Anti-Smoking Committee establishes an inspection office in accordance with Article 11 of the Regulations for the Implementation of Anti-Smoking, it will be handled by the Customs. In ports where there are no customs offices, such as Nantong, Taixing, Yizheng, Datong, and Anqing, the nearby customs offices will handle it as appropriate.</p>

<p>The six industries of silk, cloth, Guqian, Western clothing, clothing stores, and ready-made clothing suspended business and went on strike on the 12th to oppose the opening of the Dasheng Silk and Satin Bureau. The county ordered the Chamber of Commerce to coordinate with the Party Department and the Public Security Bureau to properly handle it, but there were no results. The details have been reported previously. Now, more than 900 employees of the six industries gathered at the Silk Industry Association in six teams on the morning of the 13th and invited the press. Representatives of the six industries reported the reasons and reasons for opposing Dasheng, and the planned steps. Generally, they will temporarily go on strike and wait for the official authorities to resolve it. If the strike is ineffective, they will kneel and beg the owner of Dasheng and the party and government organs to help the livelihood of their colleagues. If there are still no results, they will only unite the employees and owners of the six industries to go on a hunger strike until Dasheng leaves Jiangdu.</p>

<p>County party members Geng Boyang and others, because the county party department committed fraud in the election of county representatives in the second district and second branch of the urban area and various branches in the rural area this time, Zhang Gongren, Ling Shaozu, and Chen Kanghe, three members of the provincial committee, came to Gaoyou the day before yesterday to supervise the election. Geng immediately presented the fraudulent situation to the provincial committee. Zhang and the members of the provincial committee believed that the party affairs disputes in Gaoyou this time were not easy to resolve, so they returned to the province together this morning (the 12th), resulting in the failure of the county representative meeting to open today. It is still unknown what the result will be.</p>

<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the silk and satin industry, cotton cloth industry, and mercerized cotton velvet industry and other associations yesterday, stating: "To whom it may concern, on the 13th of this month, we received an order from the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, No. 16070, stating: "We have approved the Nanjing Municipal Government's Consultation No. 7467, according to Wang Zhichong, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau of this city, stating: "I have secretly investigated that the National Goods Consumption Committee of this government has been organized and established. However, the various silk and cloth shops always sell national goods and non-national goods together, which is confusing. I hereby order that the persons in charge of the relevant trade associations be summoned immediately to discuss and determine the method of marking national goods and non-national goods so that they can be distinguished and the citizens can avoid making mistakes. This was determined at 2:30 p.m. on August 26 to summon the persons in charge of the silk, cloth, satin, and factory cloth trade associations to discuss and decide on three principles: 1. Each silk and cloth shop should mark national goods and non-national goods with labels. Larger ones may set up a special department to sell national goods separately. 2. If each silk and cloth shop sells non-national goods as national goods, the government will severely punish them. 3. The detailed methods of items 1 and 2 will be formulated and promulgated by the Social Affairs Bureau. The Director of the Agriculture, Industry, and Commerce Section of this Bureau has drafted seven rules for marking goods in silk and cloth shops in Nanjing with the General Secretary of the National Goods Consumption Committee of this government. Is this feasible? I hereby submit a document for your review and approval. This is for the public convenience, etc. According to this, after reviewing the proposed rules, there is nothing inappropriate. In addition to announcing and ordering the implementation of the rules, I will copy the rules and send them to you for your reference and record, and I hope to see a reply, etc. After receiving the order, it was found that the silk shops displayed Chinese and foreign goods in a mixed manner, so that those who wanted to purchase national goods could not distinguish them, which had a great impact on promoting national goods and promoting production and sales. The Municipal Government revised the rules and notified the silk and cloth shops to follow them, displaying the goods sold, which were manufactured in a certain country, separately, or adding labels so that purchasers would know the difference and choose them, which was very beneficial to the promotion of national products. Before approving the consultation, in addition to the above rules being approved for record, a copy of the rules should be inspected and copied, and you should refer to them for handling and report as necessary, etc." According to this, it is urgent to send the marking rules and a provisional standard for national goods to the relevant associations for compliance, transfer orders, and reports, etc., and I deeply hope to receive your reply. The attachment is a copy of the rules for marking goods in silk and cloth shops in Nanjing and a provisional standard for Chinese national goods.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Local Daily Coal Declines, Domestic Coal Sales Gradually Increase; Coal Control Association Has Not Yet Been Implemented <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>A reporter from the Daba newspaper inquired about the current situation of domestic coal and Japanese coal in Shanghai from the coal industry. It was learned that the amount of Japanese coal recently transported and sold in this city has decreased by 70% compared to the past. The sales of domestic coal have therefore gradually developed. After the implementation of the new tariff, the tax rate for imported coal has increased by more than four yuan per ton compared to the past, so Japanese coal can no longer compete with domestic coal. Although there are still a few sales, they are entirely for Japanese merchants to purchase and use for themselves, so Japanese coal is almost extinct in the market. As for the Coal Control Association proposed by the National Economic Commission, there is currently no action in the coal industry, and the Economic Commission has not yet contacted the coal industry. It may wait until the Cotton and Silk Control Associations are established before proceeding. It is also impossible to say.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Sa Zhenbing's Remarks: This Time I Come to Specially Prepare for the Zhenwu of Fujian Province; I Deeply Hope for the Support of the Government and All Circles <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>The Minyan newspaper reported that after the naval veteran Sa Zhenbing arrived in Shanghai, he was busy contacting matters related to the disaster relief in Fujian, and he still had contacts with foreign treasure and relatives and friends here. Yesterday, a reporter from the Minyan newspaper specially visited Mr. Sa's residence, and he was received and informed of the mission and the progress of disaster relief in detail. A record is as follows: "I have been living in my hometown for many years and have long forgotten about politics. This time I came to discuss the disaster relief in Fujian with various parties, and the time of my stay will be very short. I feel guilty that I have not been able to visit all my old friends here and friends from various countries. Fujian Province has suffered from natural disasters and man-made disasters in recent years, and the beautiful mountains and rivers are full of scars. What I have heard and seen makes me feel sad, and many of my fellow villagers also blame me for the disaster relief affairs. Thinking of Fujian as my hometown, if it is beneficial to my hometown, how can I shirk my responsibility? Therefore, I do not hesitate to take on this task rashly. Fortunately, my body is still strong. For several years, I have been running around in remote and poor villages day and night. Fortunately, I have not been attacked by diseases or trapped by bandits. After a long time of practice, I feel that the life in the countryside is very interesting. When I was releasing disaster relief in Longyan, it was only ten miles away from the bandit area, and the thieves also knew that I was foolish and did not want to harm me. I also advised the militia to cultivate their own strength and guide them to build earthen forts and gun towers. During the conversation, Mr. Sa also showed photos and said that many counties in northwestern Fujian have deep mountains and poor valleys and that he had heard that there were sheep intestines trails that people had not been through and that horses could not pass through. Fortunately, I was from the navy and had been through wind and frost for a long time. Although I was old, my experience was still there. I often supervised the regiment soldiers and walked up the mountains. One day, I encountered heavy rain and flash floods, and the water could submerge my shins. Fortunately, the weather cleared up soon, and I was safe and sound. As for enduring freezing and hunger, it has been my daily life in recent years, and I dare not say that it is hard. Recently, I was mistakenly the director of the Changle County disaster relief, and I have a lot of debts besides the government's appropriation and Mr. Hu Wenhu's donation of 5,000 yuan, and I still need the assistance of generous charities from all parties. As for the various counties in northern Fujian, which have recently suffered from the Red Disaster, the severity of the disaster and the extent of the disaster area are not known to the outside world. I hope that the government authorities and people from all walks of life will give them sympathy and assistance. I am old and wish to engage in this matter."</p>

<h3 id="e132">Letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>To the Esteemed Council,</p>
<p>It has come to our attention that the Shanghai Telephone Company increased its prices last year, disregarding the impact of the January 28th Incident, and retroactively applied the increase, violating legal precedents. Your council, being in charge, failed in your responsibility to advise and prevent this, leading to its approval, creating a significant error, and leaving a blemish. A year has passed, and the company naturally seizes this opportunity to aggressively advance its interests, disregarding contracts and agreements. It imposes unforeseen responsibilities on Mr. An Sheng, while seeking to fully recoup its own miscalculations from users. This association firmly believes that your council will certainly reject the company's current request for a price increase. We earnestly hope that your council will carefully consider the correspondence between the First District Branch of the Shanghai Citizens' United Association and the Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers Association regarding this matter, as published in the newspapers. What deserves your council's deepest reflection is how the Municipal Council, in managing public utilities, should protect taxpayers, ensuring they can use these services at affordable prices. However, the reality does not align with this principle. In the case of tap water, the council agreed to the water company's amendments to the contract, allowing it to raise prices at will, causing taxpayers to lose significant amounts of money. In the case of electricity, the council permitted price increases due to rising coal prices, but failed to order price reductions when coal prices fell. The same applies to trams and public buses. It is widely known that the authorities disregard the interests of taxpayers. The Shanghai Telephone Company, taking advantage of this weakness, naturally dares to raise prices repeatedly and attempt to disregard contracts. The written agreement of the thirtieth year of the Republic of China can be ignored. In short, for all contractual provisions beneficial to taxpayers, the Municipal Council makes every effort to disregard public opinion. This matter concerns the sanctity of public utilities and contractual agreements. We, therefore, respectfully request your council to no longer be misled by the company, lest those you represent suffer further damage.</p>
<p>Respectfully submitted to the Public Concession Municipal Council,</p>
<p>The First District Citizens' United Association of Shanghai Special District,</p>

After touring the grounds, Mr. Song expressed his satisfaction and stated that he would revisit the venue within days to see the performances. It is reported that the circus's matinee performance, originally scheduled for 3:00 PM, will be moved to 5:30 PM starting tomorrow, as many patrons have official business during the day. It is also said that the ringmaster is now seeking to invite one or two Chinese performance troupes to perform worldwide with them, and will send representatives to the interior to search for rare and exotic Chinese animals to add to the circus's performances.</p>

<p>The China Merchants Bureau mortgaged five warehouse deeds to HSBC Bank for a substantial loan, initially for five million taels, followed by an additional one million taels. Including interest, the total amount exceeded ten million yuan. This time, HSBC is</p>

<p>and has ordered the Bureau to repay the loan within a specified period, or it will seize control of the warehouses. General Manager of the Bureau, Liu Hongsheng, facing urgent demands from HSBC, found it difficult to delay further. On September 18th, he presented the matter to the Board of Directors. After discussion, the Board members collectively agreed that the Bureau could not raise such a large sum of money in the short term. They jointly resolved to petition the government to allocate 15 million yuan from the Bureau's fund to facilitate the turnover and repay the substantial foreign debt that could not be delayed any longer. The petition was submitted to the Ministry of Communications through the Board of Directors and has recently received</p>
<h3 id="e138">Approval from the Ministry <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the Bureau's request to allocate 15 million yuan as a state-owned fund, the Ministry has approved the request in principle. However, the central government is currently facing economic difficulties and cannot immediately allocate such a large sum of money. As the HSBC mortgage loan cannot be extended, the Ministry instructed General Manager Liu to find a way to borrow 15 million yuan from the Shanghai banking community and to transfer the five warehouse</p>
<h3 id="e139">Deeds as Collateral <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>to the banking community as security for the new loan. Once the central government's economic situation improves, it will then allocate funds to redeem the warehouses. Upon receipt of the Ministry's approval in Shanghai, the government has, in principle, approved the request to issue funds, but is unable to allocate them due to financial constraints. General Manager Liu is preparing to comply with the Ministry's instructions and seek a fund loan of 15 million yuan from national banks in Shanghai. He will then use the five warehouse deeds retrieved from HSBC</p>
<h3 id="e140">As Collateral <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>For this loan, 10 million yuan will be used to repay HSBC and other miscellaneous loans, and the remaining funds will be used to develop the shipping industry. It is reported that Liu has recently begun negotiations with various banks in the city for this loan. Most banks are willing to provide the loan, but there are still some points for discussion regarding the loan terms. On the whole, success is expected.</p>

<p>According to the Fuxing Society, Saeki, Chief of the Criminal Section of the Japanese Consulate, Fujii, Chief of Police, Goto, Chief of Patrol, and twelve others, in conjunction with the French police, arrested Korean resident Lee Seong-gu on the 12th, believing that he was strongly suspected of involvement in the two grenade-throwing incidents at the Japanese Consulate. On the afternoon of the 13th, Korean resident Kong Kaiping, owner of the Baekje Pharmacy at 406 Avenue Joffre, at the intersection of Rue Lubin in the French Concession, was also summoned by the Japanese Consulate and imprisoned. A reporter from the Fuxing Society inquired about the details yesterday. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e142">Lee's Arrest Location <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Lee Seong-gu was arrested on the morning of the 12th. At that time, Lee was going to the Baekje Pharmacy. Before Lee arrived, two cars were parked near the French barracks at the corner of Avenue Joffre and Rue Dupanloup. When Lee Duofu entered the Baekje Pharmacy, a Chinese man followed him in and briefly examined Lee, then bought a rubber tube and left. While Lee was paying, another Chinese man, followed by nine Japanese, two French police officers, and three Chinese police officers, broke into the Baekje Pharmacy, surrounded Lee, and immediately arrested him, put him in a waiting car, and drove to the French police station, which extradited him to the Japanese Consulate.</p>

<p>After Lee was arrested, the Japanese Consulate determined that the Baekje Pharmacy was a communication center for Korean residents, and then notified the French police station to send criminal police to arrest Kong. Coincidentally, Kong was out. Afterwards, knowing that it was inevitable, Kong resolutely surrendered himself to the Japanese Consulate and was detained for interrogation. As of 6:00 PM yesterday, there was still no news. In addition to running the Baekje Pharmacy, Kong also runs the International Year Hong Company (intersection of Beijing Road and Sichuan Road) and is a well-known businessman among Korean residents. The Japanese Consulate believes that Kong is suspected of communication, and claims that Park Chang-se, the leader of the Korean Revolutionary Party's special forces, often visits the Baekje Pharmacy.</p>

<p>Lee Seong-gu, also known as Lee Soo-bong, is from Seoncheon County, Pyeonganbuk-do, Korea. He is 37 years old and married Ms. Kim Yun-ju just before May. Kim is 21 years old, beautiful, and from Pyeongwon, Korea. She graduated from the local girls' high school and speaks English. Since Lee's arrest, Jin has been running around for two days and two nights without sleep. Yesterday afternoon, she told the Fuxing Society reporter that Lee became a Chinese citizen on June 23, 1924. This arrest is a political offense, and she hopes that the Chinese government will provide protection for naturalized Korean residents. Jin went to the Japanese Consulate twice yesterday to visit Lee, but was not allowed to see him due to a ban on visits. However, the guard told Jin that Lee needed a change of underwear, which he needed, or that he was already suffering.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Inspection Teams for the Railway Exhibition Returned to Shanghai One After Another. The Opening of Through Train Service between Beiping and Shanghai Was Advanced to the 20th. The National Transportation Responsibility Will Begin on the 2nd of Next Month <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the second National Railway Products Exhibition held by the Ministry of Railways in Nanjing, to which the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administrations invited various organizations and groups from the city to visit, departed at 8:00 AM on the 12th with over 40 people. They arrived at 2:00 PM and took cars prepared by the capital to the exhibition site at the Chinese YMCA on Zhonghua Road to visit. The scale of this exhibition is even greater than the first. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e146">Welcome from the Ministry of Railways <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Yu Yanxian, Director of the Business Department of the Ministry of Railways, led the visit. A welcome tea party was held in the auditorium of the YMCA. Director Yu and Deputy Director of the Business Department Tan Yaozong delivered speeches, stating that the Ministry of Railways is holding this exhibition to raise awareness among merchants and the public, promote domestic goods sales, develop the national economy, increase railway transportation, and balance supply and demand. They also explained that they will make every effort to make railway operations more commercialized, implement responsible transportation of freight cars, and various joint transportation plans. This joint transportation method will actively seek cooperation with merchants and the public, expanding from a partial to a national scale. The through train service plan between Shanghai and Beiping, connecting national transportation and crossing the Yangtze River, was originally scheduled for the 22nd, but has now been changed to the 20th. The opening ceremony will be held on the 29th. This is the only major project in the Far East railway business, and all sectors of the country should pay close attention to it.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Visiting the Pavilions <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>When the reporter visited, starting from the Beining Pavilion, they then visited the first pavilion of the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways, the Tianjin-Pukou Pavilion, the Daokou-Qinghua Pavilion, the second pavilion of the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways, the Pinghan Pavilion, the Central Pavilion, the Jiaoji Pavilion, and the Longhai Pavilion. The products were excellent and the variety was abundant. One could only feel overwhelmed by the beauty. With such exquisite and numerous products in our country, and the current economic situation in such an irretrievable state, we must first rely on the efforts of the railway transportation industry in order to achieve increasing prosperity. The minerals and agricultural products of the Pinghan Line, and the various items in the crafts section, the coal, cotton, tobacco leaves, silk cocoons, ramie yarn, and woven goods of the Jiaoji Line, the fine art items of Weixian, the porcelain and ceramic ware of Boshan, and flour, cotton yarn, and kerosene, etc., are particularly prosperous, enough to make people happy and amazed. The excellent agricultural and industrial products of other provinces along the railway lines are also displayed in thousands, making it impossible to see them all. With such abundant resources and suffering from poverty, it further proves that the Chinese people are not working hard enough and are failing to live up to these natural resources.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Visiting the Ferry <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Next, Director Yu introduced the great project of the Yangtze River ferry for through train service between Shanghai and Beiping. The magnificent buildings on both sides of the Yangtze River ferry stand majestically on the Jiangbin between Xiaguan and Pukou. The construction of the docks is equipped with an elevated bridge similar to the Yellow River Bridge at the top. Each dock itself is divided into sections. When the Yangtze River tide rises or falls, each dock section has an elevator that can be rotated at any time to keep the height of the dock from the water surface consistent. As for the railway tracks, they are particularly rare insurance tracks nationwide, with two lines lined up and the wheels running in the middle, making it difficult to derail. The structure is particularly strong and unparalleled. There is also a "protective dock" to prevent the movement of the ferry when it is docked. As for the ferry project, it has now been completed, costing 4 million yuan afterwards. The Changjiang ferry alone cost £180,000. It is reported that after the Pingpu Road opens to traffic on the 20th of this month and officially opens on the 29th, all passenger transport from Beiping to Shanghai will only take 26 hours for one round trip, eliminating the inconvenience of boat travel. It is truly the most convenient thing for travellers.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Responsible Joint Transportation <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>According to Director Yu, the Ministry of Railways has decided to implement responsible joint transportation starting from the 1st of next month. Once this responsible joint transportation is implemented, for any freight entrusted to the Railway Bureau for delivery, all procedures en route will be the responsibility of the Ministry of Railways. The cargo owner does not need to bother at all, which is particularly convenient for commercial transportation. Deputy Director Tan's pamphlet "A Small Handbook of Procedures for Railway Freight Transportation: What Farmers, Industry, Businessmen, and All Sectors Must Know" explains it in detail. There are also the "General Rules for Responsible Transportation of Freight Cars," "Documents and Forms for Responsible Transportation of Freight Cars," "Regulations for Bills of Lading for Responsible Transportation of Freight Cars," "Detailed Rules for Handling Bills of Lading," and "Styles of Bills of Lading," "Table of Classification of Ordinary Goods," and other books for reference.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Returning to Shanghai One After Another <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>The visiting group returned to Shanghai in two batches. The first batch returned on the night train on the 13th as scheduled by the Railway Bureau. The second batch, with the consent of Director Yu after discussion among most of the group members, changed to a special train at 8:00 AM on the 14th to return. The reporter returned to Shanghai on the 14th, accompanied by only 20 or so people, who were still hosted by the Ministry of Railways. Each person was given a flower to wear on their lapel as a sign. The Ministry of Railways also gave each person more than a dozen kinds of publications. Their hospitality was truly touching. However, when the train passed through Suzhou, unfortunately, two people were crushed to death on the tracks, causing the train to arrive in Shanghai as late as 3:30 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Hai Tao, Member of the Ningxia Provincial Committee, Came to Shanghai to Beg for Relief <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>The Ningxia Provincial Government recently stated that the disaster situation is extremely severe, and the disaster victims are in dire need of relief. However, the area is located far away, and fundraising is difficult. Therefore, it specially dispatched Hai Tao, a member of the Provincial Committee, to Shanghai to report on the disaster situation to all sectors and request relief assistance. Mr. Hai has already arrived in Shanghai and is contacting relief organizations and charitable groups separately.</p>

The Social Affairs Bureau Has Scheduled Mediation for Tomorrow <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>After the sharp drop in the European and American silk markets, the price of Jiangzhe factory silk B-grade has fallen from 920 yuan per dan to 700 yuan. The silk factories in the city that are still operating are suffering huge losses on the silk they produce. They have suspended operations one after another. The silk factories that are struggling to maintain operations, after discussion by the industry association, in addition to canceling the application for the Monday worship reward and the moth-related rewards, are also petitioning the competent authorities to reduce the wages of female workers from five jiao per day to four jiao and two fen in order to maintain the current situation. After receiving the report, the Social Affairs Bureau immediately sent staff to carefully investigate the silk prices in order to serve as a reference during mediation. It has also scheduled to convene the silk factory industry association and silk reeling industry for questioning at 2:00 PM on the 16th of this month to conduct mediation in accordance with the law. According to a survey conducted by a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency at the silk factory industry association, it is known that in July of this year, after the silk market picked up, the number of silk factories operating in the city, including the South City, Zhabei, and Hongkou Concession, totaled 64. After the sharp drop in the silk market, as of yesterday, only 20 silk factories in the city were still operating with difficulty.</p>

<p>According to Xinsheng News Agency, French Senator and former Minister of Public Works, Honore, and his wife arrived in Shanghai on the French mail ship D'Artagnan the day before yesterday to attend the French-Japanese Association in Tokyo. The French Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Meriel, and his wife gave a special banquet to entertain them. Mr. Honore stayed in Shanghai for one day and left Shanghai yesterday on the Dollar Company's ship President Coolidge for Japan. He will have a short stay in Japan, and then return to Shanghai via Beiping and Nanjing. He will likely stay in Beiping and Nanjing for a short time to tour the area, and then return to Europe via Annam and Siam.</p>
<p>According to the Damei Evening News, Honore, the former Director-General of Public Education in France, is internationally renowned for his plan for the University City in Paris. His plan is to designate an area in the suburbs of Paris where countries with students studying in Paris can raise funds to build dormitories for students to live in, so that French and foreign university students can easily exchange knowledge and seek cultural communication.</p>

<p>Mr. Gu Zhutong, the former Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, has been appointed as the Commander-in-Chief of the Northern Route Bandit Suppression of the Five Provinces and must soon take office. He came to Shanghai the day before yesterday to invite the gentry and elders of Soochow in Shanghai, as well as financial giants, to a banquet to say goodbye. The gentry and elders of Soochow in Shanghai believed that Gu was about to leave for a long journey and should be given a farewell reception. Therefore, they jointly hosted a farewell banquet at the Bankers' Association at noon yesterday. Those present included Du Yuesheng, Zhang Gongquan, Shi Jingcai, Lin Kanghou, Huang Renzhi, Chen Taoyi, Lu Bohong, Zhu Yinjiang, Hu Bijian, Wu Yunzhi, Mu Ouchu, Jiang Wenyu, and others, more than thirty people in total.

He had not accomplished even one ten-thousandth of the construction. In the future, even though he would be far away from Jiangsu, he would still follow the elders of his hometown from afar and work together for their welfare. The Soochow gentry unanimously elected Mr. Shi Jingcai to deliver a speech, wishing him success in suppressing bandits in Jiangxi and returning to serve his hometown. The banquet then ended with great joy.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Yesterday, the Electric Company Workers Issued a Public Letter: Reactions to the Company's Open Letter <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>The striking workers of the Shanghai Electric Company, in response to the Shanghai Electric Company's open letter, yesterday issued a public letter stating: "To all public organizations, banks, factories, companies, merchants, and Chinese and foreign residents who use electricity in Shanghai,</p>
<p>Greetings. The Shanghai Electric Company, in order to avoid the blame from all sectors for improper arrangements leading to a labor strike, has used the means of public apology and issued an open letter to seek support. However, the facts are undeniable and cannot be cunningly defended. Therefore, we hereby clarify the following:</p>
<p>(1) The first item in the open letter states that the increase in price is 3.6%, while the increase in wages for Chinese staff has reached 20.6%. However, according to the facts, any user knows that calculated according to the method during the era of the Public Works Department, the increase is 9.09%. Furthermore, if the wage increase for Chinese staff is calculated at 20.6%, then for workers whose wages were 50 yuan during the Public Works Department era, it should now be 63 yuan. However, the daily wages of ordinary workers, who previously earned 50 yuan, are now only 51 yuan, an increase of only 2% when calculated as a percentage. From this fact, it can be seen that the company is deceiving the public and attempting to evade responsibility.</p>
<p>(2) The second item in the open letter states that since 1928, the company has laid off 21.6% of its foreign staff and 18.1% of its Chinese staff. This is the company openly admitting to dismissing Chinese and foreign staff. It is also the company admitting to violating the agreement on the handover from the Public Works Department, which guaranteed that Chinese staff would enjoy the same stable service rights as they did during the Public Works Department era, and violating the announcement by the General Engineer and Manager Mr. O'lchie, which guaranteed that Chinese staff would enjoy the same service and rights as they did during the Public Works Department era. (The announcement is recorded below.) As for the dismissal of foreign staff, it is unknown whether it was due to the expiration of contracts. If it was not due to the expiration of contracts and foreign staff were dismissed, then like the dismissed Chinese staff, the company refuses to pay the due pension on the pretext of this. Therefore, we also stand on the position of those who have served the company for a long time, regardless of Chinese or foreign nationality, and have made contributions, to speak out against injustice. The Shanghai General Labor Union's report points out the different treatment of Chinese and foreign staff, and it is clear that the company's methods for ensuring the electricity business have not been improved, and there is a deliberate intention to reduce the value of the service of Chinese staff and not give them the same proportional treatment. It is not that the rights of foreign staff are being suppressed. The reason for the unfairness is not that foreign staff are gaining more benefits, but that Chinese staff are being deprived of the benefits they deserve, and the company is not understanding the modern management methods for protecting public utilities, which makes the electricity business, on which the public interest depends, unable to develop safely. Therefore, what it says in the second item is not enough to clarify that its dismissal of more than 400 Chinese staff and its refusal to pay the 5% reward on the pretext are reasonable. This is irrelevant, and the facts are very clear.</p>
<p>(3) The third item in the open letter states that the company not only pays all the rewards entrusted by the Public Works Department, but also that the current rewards set by the company are more generous than before. The Shanghai General Labor Union has admitted in its published report that the current reward system set by the company is indeed better than before. As for the statement that all rewards have been paid, it is purely deceptive. Fan Lisheng, Pan Genlin, Ni Wenfeng, Chen Baogen, Zhang Caisheng, who were previously dismissed by the company for representing workers in negotiations with the company, and Qiu Binggen, Dai Renheng, and Xue Abao, who were recently dismissed without reason, have not received any rewards from the company to this day, except for wages. Among the more than 400 workers who were previously dismissed, there are even more who have not yet received the rewards they deserve. May we ask if the company can list the names of all the dismissed workers and provide evidence of receiving the rewards?</p>
<p>(4) The fourth and fifth items in the open letter are not disputes in the company's manufacturing of the labor strike issue and need not be argued.</p>
<p>(5) The seventh item in the open letter states that the workers went on strike without reason or warning, and that it did not receive any requests beforehand. This statement is false and does not need to be refuted by our colleagues. The Shanghai General Labor Union's report has already explained it in detail. Here, we extract the facts as the following proof: (A) The first time, Fan Lisheng, Zhu Haoshen, Jiang Zhengming, and Ni Zhifu, representing the workers, negotiated with the company and were received by Vice President Mr. Scheld, but there was no sincere expression of discussion of the request. The second time they went to negotiate, they were rejected and Fan Lisheng was dismissed as a result. After that, all the foremen went to request it, but were also rejected. On July 3 of this year, for the pension issue, Ni Wenfeng, Pan Genlin, Zhang Caisheng, and Chen Baogen were again sent as representatives to negotiate, but not only were they rejected, but the four representatives were dismissed. In the middle of the question, the colleagues again signed their names to request acceptance, but were also rejected. (B) At the request of the labor union, party and government agencies sent representatives to investigate the company twice and indicated their willingness to mediate, but the company did not accept. (C) Zhu Xuefan and Shao Xubai, members of the Shanghai General Labor Union, in order to implement the Shanghai General Labor Union's recently adopted plan to encourage workers to work with peace of mind and dissuade strikes, separately invited Mr. Wang Xiaolai, chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, and Chinese directors Yuan and Xu Xinliu, to seek opinions from the company out of personal friendship to mediate, but were rejected by the company authorities due to their preconceived ideas and firm attitude. (D) Mr. Zhongjie, the president of the Public Works Department, at the request of more than 200 workers' representatives to mediate and driven by a sense of responsibility for managing municipal affairs, also discussed with the company ways to eliminate disputes and mediate properly, but was also rejected by the company authorities due to their preconceived ideas and firm attitude. The above are all facts that the colleagues tried their best to avoid using the strike warning before implementing the strike warning. As for the transformation from a strike warning to a strike, it was caused by the company's deliberate intensification of the facts by closing the factory gates and refusing entry after the strike warning.</p>
<p>(6) The sixth, eighth, ninth, tenth, and eleventh items in the open letter and the explanations attached to the second item are all intended to impose unwarranted crimes on the colleagues and the leaders who guide the colleagues in good faith by fabricating facts or making worthless speculation, and to publicly provoke those who have prepared enough workers to maintain power generation services, those who advise power generation workers not to participate in the strike from the Shanghai General Labor Union, and those who order firefighters to resume work for the sake of public safety and to prevent fire alarms.</p>
<p>In short, this labor strike was actually provoked by the company's refusal to accept the prior requests of the colleagues due to its preconceived ideas and its refusal to accept the good intentions of all parties to mediate. As for the future actions of the colleagues, they should still, within the scope of their ability, take care of the interests of Chinese and foreign electricity users throughout the city and the safety and tranquility of society, respectfully abide by the advice of the Shanghai General Labor Union, and that power generation workers and firefighters who have resumed work should not participate in the strike, endure humiliation and pain, and not cause any changes, in order to await social justice. It is hoped that social organizations and Chinese and foreign users will assist the colleagues with reasonable opinions, implement the advice of the Shanghai General Labor Union to guide the striking workers to obey the order and suppress their anger, and that the completion of the work will not sit idly by and allow the forces of life requirements to rise up and instigate anger, causing the Shanghai General Labor Union and its colleagues to lose their authority to persuade, and to avoid the occurrence of incidents that are useless to society. This is a blessing for society, and also a blessing for the colleagues and striking workers who are now serving in accordance with the order with pain. We express our opinions with tears and plead with humility. We hope that everyone will take a public view.</p>
<p>Before the above opinions were released, they were actually shown to all the workers and signed by each worker with their consent. The original of this signature is being photographed and sent to the Shanghai General Labor Union to prove the verification of the previous facts to all sectors. Publicly announced by more than 2,000 workers of the Shanghai Electric Company who were forced to strike.</p>
<p>Attached is the announcement of the former General Engineer and General Manager O'lchie: To all staff, since the proposal of the Public Works Department was rejected at the taxpayers' meeting, I now know that the staff are afraid that all their interests will be harmed, and that their future service in Shanghai will not be as stable as under the Public Works Department. Therefore, they are panicked. I think you may not have understood the guarantee method stipulated in Article 14 of the special charter planned and announced by the Special Electricity Board (organized in 1929). I hereby solemnly declare that in the discussions between the Special Electricity Board and the three groups that purchased the Electricity Department, extra attention was paid to your interests and to protecting the future status of each staff member, just as it was under the Public Works Department, without any changes. The representatives of the American and Foreign Power Company also assured me that they had no intention of replacing staff. I know that there is a suspicion among the staff, that is, whenever a company takes over the Electricity Department, it must send its own personnel to replace positions such as those of Qi Qi. However, the company guarantees that this will never happen. You should know that I have no intention of trying to transfer the staff who have helped me to build this effective agency. The American and Foreign Power Company is well aware of the unexpected panic of the current staff, so it sent a telegram to reduce it. This telegram has been handed over to me by the company's representative in Shanghai. I hereby copy a copy and attach it later. Signed by the General Engineer and General Manager O'lchie, April 24, 1929.</p>
<p>Letter from Mr. Mou Fei, representative of the American and Foreign Power Company in Shanghai, to Mr. O'lchie: I have received the following telegram from Mr. Mi Queer, Minister of the Electricity Company's Supervision Department and Minister of the American and Foreign Power Company's Supervision Department, and Mr. Erte, General Manager of the American and Foreign Power Company: "Mr. Mou Fei, please forward this telegram to Mr. O'lchie. Our international group pays its respects to Mr. O'lchie and the well-being of his staff and welcomes them as members of our group. Regarding the future of each staff member in Shanghai, we will fully protect it and believe that under the new company's name, they should still work together to enable the public to continue to benefit." Because I cannot personally see each staff member, please convey my sincerity, welcome, and protection to everyone. Signed by Mou Fei, representative of the American and Foreign Power Company in Shanghai, April 22, 1929.</p>

<p>After more than 2,000 workers at the Anglo-American Tobacco Company's Third Factory on Tao Peng Road in this city announced a strike the day before yesterday, news was released yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Labor Union Petition <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at 9:00, the Fourth District Cigarette Industry Labor Union sent Zhou Xuexiang, executive director, and worker representatives Chen Shikui and Li Bingyan, etc., to petition the party and government agencies separately, requesting (1) that the company recognize the organization of the Anglo-American Office; (2) that the office have the right to represent all workers; (3) that the labor union be allowed to send personnel to the factory to collect membership fees; (4) that the wages not paid during the strike be paid in full immediately; (5) that a labor union notice board be set up in the factory to allow the labor union to post notices; (6) that the factory should subsidize the labor union with 500 yuan per month; and (7) that the dismissed workers Chen Shikui, etc., be reinstated. The Social Bureau was received by Section Chief Wang Gang, and the Municipal Party Department was received by Cadre Lu Yinchu, who promised to handle the matter in accordance with the law.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Stop the Strike <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the Social Bureau issued a reply to the Fourth District Cigarette Industry Labor Union, stating that, according to the resolution of the representative conference, the request to the capitalists was rejected, and a request for resolution was submitted successively. It is reported that a general membership representative conference was held on the 11th, but the bureau had not been reported in advance, and the record was already inappropriate, so how could the strike be carried out hastily and recklessly violate the law? Furthermore, the first item of the so-called request conditions has already been adjudicated by the Zhongnong Committee, and the remaining items should also wait quietly for verification in accordance with the law. You must abide by this reply.</p>

<p>In addition to ordering the labor union not to strike rashly, the Social Bureau also issued a notice to the British Tobacco Company and the Fourth District Cigarette Industry Labor Union, stating that, for the matter of the labor dispute in the Anglo-American Third Factory, the bureau has scheduled a meeting at 10:00 a.m. on the 17th of this month to gather for an interview. You are hereby notified to designate two responsible representatives to come to the bureau to listen to the interview. Special notification, October 14, 22nd year of the Republic of China, Director Wu Xingya.</p>

<p>Due to the large fluctuations in international exchange rates, the exchange of collect calls between the United States and China was suspended on August 1. News telegrams were resumed first on August 2, and business telegrams were also resumed on August 11. However, full-price ordinary telegrams are still not applicable to the collect call method. According to news from the local International Telegraph Office, starting from the 16th of this month, full-price telegrams sent to various places in the United States regarding news or the publication of periodicals can also be paid for by the receiving party.</p>

<h3 id="e164">The Northwest Intermodal Transport Officially Opens on November 1 <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's intermodal transport on the Longhai Railway is of great importance to the shipping industry. Due to insufficient arrangements, it has been changed to be implemented next month. The details are recorded as follows.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Survey Situation <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>The bureau sent Wu Delin and Zhang Huanwen to Xilian Island to survey and determine the new wharf and arrange the lighters. Yesterday, Zhang sent a telegram to Shanghai, briefly stating that the old kiln's berthing and customs declaration matters had been negotiated with the Jiaohai Customs, and the customs had temporarily sent an officer to reside in the area for the bureau's ships to handle customs clearance. Permission has been granted to facilitate the matter. As for the establishment of a ship wharf in the kiln, due to the recent bad weather and excessive wind and waves, only six piles have been driven. Construction will resume after the weather improves, and it is expected to be completed next month. The accommodation materials for the warehouse workers have been transported and can be built quickly. The water depth at both ends of Xilian Island and Donglian Island is estimated to be 14 feet deep. If there is a northwest wind, the ship can berth at Donglian Island, and if there is a northeast wind, it can stop at Xilian Island, which is more stable.</p>
<h3 id="e166">The Track is About to be Completed <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Most of the branch line of the old kiln railway laid on the Longhai Railway has been completed, and only one kilometer remains to be completed. The railway bureau is rushing to build it day and night to complete it all within October. After that, the loading and unloading of goods can directly reach the river bank, without the need for transshipment and carrying.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Warehouse Issues <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>However, there is one extremely difficult problem, which is the warehouse workers in that place. The bureau has decided to send workers from Shanghai, but the local workers in the old kiln have heard the news and expressed their opposition, resolutely refusing to allow the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to send other workers to the area. Zhang Wu and others sent a telegram to Shanghai for instructions. Yesterday afternoon, the bureau also replied, ordering them to consult with the Longhai Railway Bureau to achieve the purpose of sending their own workers. Zhang's telegram stated that he had personally gone to Zhengzhou to discuss the matter with the local authorities of the railway.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Sailing Next Month <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has approved the Longhai intermodal transport to officially send ships to operate from November 1. It is temporarily designated that the same ship and one chartered ship will operate. The wharf and warehouse, etc., will be completed by the end of the month. Yesterday, the H Bureau also telegraphed Zhang and others, urging them to proceed in the old kiln and not delay any further, because the ship schedule has already been arranged.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Industry Competition <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Private Chinese shipping companies are determined to compete with the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company for navigation on the intermodal transport. If there is a shortage of ships, each bureau will send shifts, and the Sanbei Company will open a Guangdong route at this time to take the lead. Yu Qiaqing will host a banquet for various Hakka people from Guangdong in the next day or two to solicit freight.</p>
<h3 id="e170">The Coast Patrol Office Moves Back to Wusong <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>The National Coast Patrol Office of Wusong Fort Taiwan is an important agency of the Navy. The position of director is filled by Wu Zhennan. Whenever piracy or other disasters occur along the coast, the office can dispatch fleets to suppress them. After the January 28 Incident in Shanghai, all the buildings of the office were destroyed. It temporarily moved to the Hydrographic Survey Bureau in the Xinxiqu area of Longhua, Shanghai, to work. It has now been rebuilt with funds allocated by the Ministry of the Navy and has been completed. Therefore, the office has now moved back to its original site in Wusong and started working.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Japanese Merchants Resume North China Shipping: One of the Reasons for the Relaxation of Resistance and the Infiltration of Inferior Goods <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>After the January 28 Incident, Japanese ships on the North China line suspended their schedules and stopped sailing due to the impact of resistance. Since January and February of this year, there has been a daily increase in the number of inferior goods shipped to North China. The Dalian Steamship Company specially decided to resume the regular passenger ship route on the Shanghai-Tianjin line to compete with our country's shipping companies in the North China shipping industry. It has been decided to specially dispatch the 1,300-ton passenger ship Tianhumaru to operate from the 16th of this month. Another ship will be added later.</p>

<p>The Shanghai charitable organizations Northeast Refugee Relief Association and the United Association for Raising Funds for the Yellow River Flood Relief held a joint meeting at Renji Hall on Yunnan Road at 6:00 p.m. yesterday. More than ten committee members, including Xu Shiying, attended. Xu Shiying chaired the meeting, reported on the income and expenditure of relief funds and supplies for the Northeast Association, and discussed several important resolutions. The details are recorded publicly as follows.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Names of Attendees <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>The attendees listed yesterday included Xu Shiying, Zhu Ziqiao, Wang Zhen, Du Yuesheng (represented by Li Yuzai), Wang Xiaolai, Wen Lanting, Huang Hanzhi, Xie Shishan, Guan Jiong, Zheng Hongnian (represented by Bo Du), Huang Bodu, Wang Rutang (represented by Liu Yunfang), Zhang Xiaolin (represented by Jiang Zuozhou), Liu Yunfang, Li Zizai, Qian Jingping, Xi Yushu, and more than ten others.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Matters Reported <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>After announcing the opening of the meeting, Chairman Xu Shiying reported on (1) the amount of relief funds received and spent and the types and quantities of relief supplies received and spent by the Northeast Refugee Relief Association; and (2) the telegrams from two executive directors, Qu Wenliu and Feng Yangshan, stated that the counties of Zunhua, Qian'an, and Fengrun have now been fully investigated and released, and the counties of Miyun and Guyuan will be visited for relief.</p>
<h3 id="e176">Discussion of Resolutions <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>After the report, the discussion began immediately. (1) A telegram from two executive directors, Qu Wenliu and Feng Yangshan, stated that it is also possible to send personnel from here to investigate the project. It is pushed that the county's flood is very heavy, and the winter is approaching, so cotton clothes must also be distributed, and it is hoped that the clothing funds will be widened. It is estimated that there must be at least 5,000 sets of cotton clothes, and the current amount of 20,000 yuan cannot be started for investigation and release, because once the investigation is carried out, relief must be provided. Furthermore, Dongming and Puyang, which were also heavily affected, must have the same requirements. Has there been another way? Please send a telegram together. (Resolution) Allocate 10,000 yuan to relieve the three counties of cotton clothing. If the Northeast Association has surplus funds, it will be allocated to the Yellow River Disaster Relief Association. (2) Master Hongsan telegraphed that the disaster area in Huaxian County is still flooded because the Changyuan breach has not been blocked. Six hundred villages within 5,000 square miles are still flooded. The situation is extremely miserable. Thirty-five effective accommodation sites have been set up, and thin porridge is eaten every day. Now it is deep autumn, and the north is cold, but they are still wearing single clothes. Many children are naked, suffering from hunger and cold, and it is unbearable to see. The cotton clothes previously transported are not enough to be distributed. I implore you to quickly raise funds and plan to relieve Mengjin. Please remit the case quickly. (Resolution) There is no fund to comfort and relieve cotton clothes. Find a way to raise funds and release them. (3) Li Yunmen came from Zimaozhou and Donglili telegraphed that he arrived today. In winter, he will go to the disaster area to inspect and check the most severely affected areas. There are 21,775 households and 114,547 people who have no homes and cannot survive without relief. There are many cases of dysentery and malaria. Seeing the disaster victims, crying for hunger and cold, the situation is extremely pitiful. The weather is now severely cold, and the most needed is more than cotton clothing. It is planned to make 10,000 sets, each set costing about one yuan, to alleviate the urgent need to respect the fixed relief funds, which cannot be distributed. I beg you to do your best to raise funds and allocate huge sums of money to save the survivors. (Resolution) The government has allocated cotton clothing, and 10,000 ginseng need not be purchased separately. (4) Zhu Ziqiao, a standing committee member, copied and sent a micro telegram from Tang Mufen from Daokou, stating that the houses in the disaster villages are gone, and the disaster victims' single clothes are incomplete. Shed cotton clothes are the most urgent need, and fuel is also extremely scarce. The disaster victims are looking for and digging for acorn doors that can be used for cooking. Another telegram came from Dongming, stating that the mouth has not been blocked, and the north bank is still turbulent. There are still many flooded villages in Changpu. The disaster victims' clothing is more urgent than food, and housing is even more urgent than clothing. Most of the house materials are buried in the sand and can be collected. Ten yuan of relief can provide a home for a family. Please donate generously. (Resolution) Reply to the second resolution to raise funds for sheds. (5) The Hebei Provincial Government sent a telegram stating that the Yellow River breach in this area has hit Changyuan, Dongming, Puyang and other counties in this province first. The severity of the disaster is actually higher than that of the two provinces of Yu. Please provide universal benevolence and hope to set up a temporary office in accordance with the regulations in order to conduct on-site investigation. (Resolution) Forward the telegram to Qu Feng and ask them to contact Chairman Yu. (6) Du Yuesheng, a standing committee member, submitted a telegram from Chairman Qing Xia Hongda, stating that since summer, the rivers and canals have been flooded, and the number of disaster victims has reached hundreds of thousands of households, waiting for relief and waiting for good news. (Resolution) Find a way to raise funds and release them. (7) The Suiyuan Provincial Government Relief Association telegraphed that the Yellow River flooded the Linhe and other counties in the Sui area, turning them all into swamps. At present, there are 200,000 disaster victims, and the tragedy is unbearable. I respectfully ask for rescue and relief. (Resolution) Ask the former. (6) The Yellow River Emergency Relief Association has only 27,000 yuan in donations, which is not enough to borrow money. And Lu Yu telegraphed to continue allocating relief funds. How should we plan? (Resolution) Strive to raise funds. After the discussion, the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Liu Zhenhua's Letter <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>The various police groups in this city raised funds for the Yellow River flood relief, and yesterday received a letter from Liu Zhenhua, commander-in-chief of the Suppression of Bandits Army in the Su-Zou-Wan Border Area, stating that he had just approved a large letter, in which 20,000 yuan was divided into the two prefectures of Yu Bin, and the two masters, Hongsan and Mingzun, and Mr. Zhang Ze brought relief funds and supplies to Bian for investigation and release. In order to assist in the collection of scars and hunger, it is extremely miserable, leading the people to admire the benevolent customs and transport them without limit. It has been found that the people in more than 20 disaster-stricken counties in Yu Province have no food or clothing, and their situation is on the verge of desperation. It is necessary to continue raising large sums of relief funds, which are continuously supplied and are not enough to recover the catastrophic engraving and save the masses of people. The noble association unites charitable groups and raises funds widely, making a call to ascend to a high place, knowing that all good deeds will return to the same destination. In the future, if there are relief funds raised, it is hoped that they will be investigated and released one after another, so that millions of disaster victims can survive and be grateful for the kindness. The town of Hua Yi and the township, as far as their cotton strength can reach, should assist. All fundraising and implementation situations are still hoped to be shown at any time for your help. Respectfully sent to the Shanghai charitable organizations raising funds for the Yellow River flood relief, Liu Zhenhua respectfully started.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Tang Jincheng, a Driver of the China Merchants Electric Car Company, Cares About the Disaster Victims; Yesterday, He Donated 200 Yuan, Which He Had Saved Over the Years, to the Yellow River and Five Counties Flood Relief Associations <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>Tang Jincheng, a driver of the China Merchants Electric Car Company, was moved by reading the newspaper about the Yellow River breach and the floods in Jiangsu, Sichuan, Nan, Chong, Bao, Qi and other counties, where disaster victims were everywhere and starving. He personally sent 200 yuan, which he had saved over the years of service in the company, to the Yellow River Flood Relief United Association and the Jiangsu Five Counties Flood Relief Association in Renji Shantang on Yunnan Road yesterday to relieve the disaster. The two associations issued receipts and left. People like Mr. Tang are truly commendable.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Essentials for Emergency Relief in Qidong <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>The China Relief Society, in conjunction with the Sino-Foreign Joint Relief Committee, is jointly organizing emergency relief efforts in Qidong. Mr. Qiu Wenqing, a member of the society, has been publicly appointed as the director, and Mr. Lu Zhinan as the deputy director. They, along with more than ten relief workers including Zhan Yulong, have already departed for the disaster-stricken areas of Qidong to investigate and provide relief. The disaster situation in the county is extremely severe, with disaster victims crying out for help, lacking food and clothing. There are as many as sixty to seventy thousand people in dire need. Although the two organizations are working together, the disaster is vast and the funds are limited, making it difficult to provide comprehensive assistance. It is hoped that philanthropists at home and abroad, as well as fellow Jiangsu natives, will show concern for their hometown and provide urgent assistance. With such support, tens of thousands of disaster victims can gradually recover and catch their breath.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Municipal Government Rejects Municipal Chamber of Commerce's Request for Exemption of Jiangwan Boat Tax <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government, regarding the Jiangwan boat tax case, replied to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, stating: "Your submission has been received. The Jiangwan waterway connects Wusong in the east and Dachang in the west, serving as a vital route for ships entering the city. The boat tax is therefore very important and cannot be easily waived. These boats, as they operate within the city's rivers, intercepting goods and sailing, should be registered and taxed according to regulations without any doubt. As for the Wusong small carts, a temporary exemption of six months was granted because these carts are owned by local villagers and used for personal transportation, limited to the Wusong area. This is different in nature from boats transporting goods and occupying the city's rivers. Furthermore, from October onwards, the small carts must still be taxed according to regulations. The request to exempt Jiangwan boat tax based on the precedent of not taxing local villagers raising cattle, sheep, and pigs for plowing and transportation, but taxing them upon slaughter, is difficult to approve. This reply is hereby issued for your information."</p>

<h3 id="e183">News Censorship Bureau Inspects Social News; Central Propaganda Committee Sends Letter to Municipal Party Headquarters for Compliance <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>According to the National Press, Mr. Feng Yixian, the executive director of the Education Association of the Six Districts of this city, previously submitted a report to the Municipal Education Bureau regarding the unrestrained descriptions of obscene events between men and women in social news published in various newspapers in the city, which he believed were detrimental to social morals. He requested that measures be taken to ban them. The bureau, after receiving the letter, considered the matter to be of great importance to the future of the nation and the people, and since this city is a focal point for both Chinese and foreigners, it was detrimental to the national image. Therefore, it specially invited representatives from the Public Security and Social Affairs Bureaus to discuss solutions, and decided to send a letter to the Municipal Party Headquarters to forward to the central government, requesting the revision of news censorship standards to include social news in order to thoroughly eliminate this problem. The original report has already been published in previous newspapers. It is now reported that the Central Propaganda Committee, in addition to adding a clause regarding "the retention or deletion of social morality news" to the news censorship standards, which was submitted to the Central Standing Committee for approval on the 5th of this month, also sent a special letter to the Municipal Party Headquarters of this city for compliance. The original letter is copied below: "To the direct addressee, the Central Executive Committee Secretariat forwarded a document from your committee to the central government, requesting the amendment of news censorship standards and the banning of obscene records to maintain morality. The Propaganda Committee, etc., reviewed and considered that banning obscene records in newspapers is indeed essential. The original proposer, Feng Yixian, cares about social morality and his suggestions are insightful. However, the news censorship standards have already been revised, adding a clause regarding 'the retention or deletion of social morality news,' which was submitted to the Central Standing Committee for approval on the 5th of this month. This letter is specially sent for your information, and to commend the original proposer. Respectfully addressed to the Shanghai Special Municipality Executive Committee." It is reported that after receiving the letter, the department proposed it at the 93rd regular meeting and resolved to commend the original proposer and send a letter to the Education, Public Security, and Social Affairs Bureaus for compliance.</p>

<p>Jin Jiulin, Inspector of the Special Agency of the French Concession Police Department, along with Head Detectives Zhang Ziying and Qian Yumin, Deputy Detectives Zhou Bingcheng and Zhou Yaoting, and Detectives Cui Zhenguo, Qin Youyu, and Cai Jinzhang, etc., arrested prominent kidnapping kingpins Zheng Tangsheng (also known as Guan Shengsheng), Shang Zhen, Liu Yimin, Wu Shaoting, Geng Huatang, Li Yueshan, Fang Qingshan, and suspects Yu Yuanzhou, Chang Jianxi, Wang Shikong, Bian Zengyan, and a woman named Zheng Chenshi, totaling twelve men and women, in Tianjin in July of this year. They were transferred to Shanghai. Also, Cao Ziqing and Li Youren, two related individuals, were brought from the First Special District Prison in the Public Concession. It was found that from 1928 to February of this year, the bandits successively kidnapped Huang Yuyi, the deputy director of the Zhongnan Bank, Chen Yanghe, the deputy manager of the Siming Bank, Ze Lin, the son of Yunnan Division Commander Gu Zizhen, He Shaoting, the owner of the Xinsenji Construction Factory, Huang Baohua, a major dye merchant, etc., in this city, extorting huge sums of money for their release. They also kidnapped Chen Zhuling and Liang Huiwu, two compradores of Jardine Matheson in Tianjin, tore up the tickets, buried the bodies, and eliminated the evidence. They also strangled their accomplice, Xiao Shaoxing. Furthermore, when kidnapping Huang Yuyi, they shot and killed Huang's chauffeur and injured two guards. They also suspected that Wu Kunshan, a representative sent by Huang's family to negotiate the ransom, embezzled the ransom money and lured Wu to Zhongshan Road and shot him to death. These serious cases were transferred to the Second Special District Local Court, and public prosecutions were filed based on the Regulations for the Suppression of Bandits and the crime of murder. After a trial presided over by Li Changnian, the suspects Yu Yuanzhou, Chang Jianxi, Wang Shikong, Bian Zengyan, and Zheng Chenshi, whom the police department did not prosecute, were released first. The nine defendants, Zheng, Shang, Liu, Wu, Geng, Li, Fang, Cao, and Li, were remanded in custody to await further trial. However, Geng Huatang, fearing punishment, hanged himself in the police station detention center on the 1st of this month. Later, the two inmates, Zheng and Shang, learned of Geng's suicide and also attempted suicide at the same time. Fortunately, the guards discovered them early and rescued them, sending them to the hospital for treatment. On the 9th of this month, a continued hearing was held, and the debate was declared closed, with a date set for sentencing. All these details have been published in previous newspapers. Yesterday was the date of sentencing. At 9:00 AM, the police department escorted the defendants to the court. Judge Li presided over the criminal court and ordered the defendants to be brought to the court. After a brief interrogation, the main text of the judgment was announced: Zheng Tangsheng was sentenced to death for continuous kidnapping and extortion, with permanent deprivation of civil rights. He was also sentenced to two years of imprisonment for receiving stolen goods, to be executed concurrently with the death penalty, with permanent deprivation of civil rights. Shang Zhen was sentenced to death for continuous kidnapping and extortion, with permanent deprivation of civil rights. Liu Yimin was sentenced to death for continuous kidnapping and extortion, with permanent deprivation of civil rights, and to life imprisonment for joint murder, to be executed concurrently with the death penalty, with permanent deprivation of civil rights. Wu Shaoting was sentenced to death for continuous kidnapping and extortion, with permanent deprivation of civil rights, and to life imprisonment for assisting in murder, to be executed concurrently with the death penalty, with permanent deprivation of civil rights. Li Yueshan was sentenced to fifteen years of imprisonment for continuous kidnapping and extortion, with deprivation of civil rights for fifteen years. Cao Ziqing, Li Youren, and Fang Qingshan were found not guilty. The prosecution of Geng Huatang was not accepted. A check for 1,300 yuan from the Qunye Bank (found on Zheng Tangsheng) was confiscated. The defendants were all returned to the detention center to await further instructions. After the judgment, bailiffs from the First Special District Court presented an official document requesting that the defendants be transferred for interrogation. The judge ruled that since the four defendants, Zheng, Shang, Liu, and Wu, had already been sentenced to death, there was no need for transfer, but Li Yueshan, Cao Ziqing, and Li Youren were allowed to be transferred for interrogation.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Continued Trial of the Huge Customs Clerk Fraud Case; Complete Interrogation of Witnesses Yesterday; Emphasis on the Organization of the Customs <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Customs clerks and unscrupulous merchants organized the Hezhong Company, fraudulently evading millions in customs duties. Nine defendants, including Su Kunnian, Shi Cunqiao, Wang Yueren, Wei Anxiang, Jiang Genhan, Zhang Qiutao, Sun Guozhang, Chen Zhongshan, and Chen Guoliang, were detained by the local court and prosecuted. At 2:00 PM yesterday, Judge Qian Chengjun continued the trial. The defendants were represented by lawyers Qu Yue, Yao Jiapeng, Zhang Enhua, and E Sen. The Jianghai Customs was represented by lawyer Jiang Yiping, who also filed a private prosecution. Those summoned included Deputy Tax Commissioner Schubert, Assistant Zhuang Zezong, Peng Shi, the head of the Water Patrol Police Criminal Division, and Chinese Detective Cheng Yongnian, etc. The official questioned Zhuang Zezong, 37 years old, from Shanghai, currently serving as an assistant in the anti-smuggling section of the Customs. He was asked if he was familiar with the general affairs department of the Customs. He replied that he had worked there before. He was asked if most imports and exports are declared for tax. He replied yes. He was asked if the case involved import taxes. He replied yes. He was asked where the import tax declaration process starts. He replied, the Valuation Section, and then it is sent to the General Affairs Department for tax assessment. He was asked where the assessment is done. He replied, the Tax Assessment Counter, but it must first go through the Warehouse Receipt Counter. He was asked what they do. He replied, the Warehouse Receipt Counter removes the numbers, while the Tax Assessment Counter collects taxes based on the documents, issues tax payment certificates, and then sends them to the Waiting Room for issuance, which completes the tax payment. The tax is paid at the Central Bank's office. He was asked where it goes after the tax payment certificate is issued. He replied, the Tax Collection and Storage Counter. He was asked where it goes after that. He replied, it is then filed by the clerks. He was asked about the supervision counter. He replied, that is the head of the import department. He was asked how far away it is. He replied, very close. He was asked how many cases there are in total. He replied, fifty-eight cases, mostly involving fraud by the Hezhong Company. At this point, lawyer Jiang Yiping stated that initially, genuine declaration forms were replaced with fake ones when the tax was not paid, so some genuine forms were actually fake, and some fake forms had genuine stamps. Therefore, some of the existing archived files and some of the documents found in the Hezhong Company had fake stamps, so it was entirely copied from the Hezhong Company. The official questioned Xu Zihan, a customs tax official for 13 years. He was asked if he was related to Zhang Qiutao. He replied no. He was asked where he works. He replied, the Import Tax Payment Counter. He was asked where Zhang Qiutao works. He replied, he works at my counter, but he is a clerk. He was asked if Zhang Qiutao ever argued with someone in black clothing. He replied he did not notice. At this point, Wan Shougen testified that he was a clerk in the Customs Document Sorting Room. He was asked what Sun Guozhang does. He replied, I order the declaration forms and he takes them away. He was asked if there is a fixed number of declaration forms ordered. He replied, there is no fixed number, hundreds for thick stacks, a few for thin stacks, there is no fixed standard. I only order, and I don't know the number. He was asked if the tax is paid when ordering the declaration forms. He replied it is already paid. He was asked if fake forms are inserted when ordering the declaration forms. He replied, I don't know. He was asked how the declaration forms are stolen. He replied, I am on the third floor, I don't know, etc. At this point, the official announced that the case would be adjourned for two weeks for further interrogation. The defendants were all returned to custody. All the evidence, after being numbered and explained by lawyer Jiang Yiping, was submitted for review.</p>
<h3 id="e186">The Truth About Ji A'gen's Gun and Axe Attack; Wei A'gen's Improper Behavior; Old Man Sends People to Murder Him <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>Ji A'gen, a coppersmith from Jiangbei, 27 years old, lived at 57 Yuqing Lane, Gonghe Road, Zhabei. Unexpectedly, around 5:00 AM the day before yesterday, while A'gen and his wife, Wang, were sound asleep, five assailants suddenly arrived, each wielding a handgun and a sharp axe, and simultaneously attacked Ji with guns and axes. He was struck by four axes and one bullet to the nose. The assailants fled the scene immediately. The Second Branch of the Fourth District Police Station sent Ji to the hospital, where his condition was critical. Details have already been published in this newspaper. After the incident, various rumors circulated in the vicinity. Some said that Ji's friends, Ma and Guo, were both in love with the same woman, and were competing for her affections. Ji mediated between them, and as a result, the woman went to Ma. However, Guo still maintained a secret relationship with the woman, which was discovered by Ji, who questioned Guo, causing Guo to become angry and commit this vicious act. However, only last night did someone discover the truth. It turns out that Ji's "Old Man," a certain Jia, is a well-known figure among the gangsters in Zhabei, with a penchant for women, having as many as four concubines. Ji was originally a beloved disciple of Jia. Unexpectedly, someone recently sowed discord in front of Jia, claiming that Ji was having an affair with Jia's third concubine, creating a scandalous relationship disguised as a teacher-disciple bond. This angered Jia greatly, but on the surface, he could not openly break ties. Therefore, he secretly sent many of his followers to carry out this vicious attack on Ji. Currently, the Second Branch of the Fourth District Police Station is thoroughly investigating the case.</p>

<p>Many textile factories are located in the Jinxiu Lane area of Zhizaoju Road in the Nanshi district, all employing workers from Anhui province. Yesterday morning at 9:30 AM, Zhou Daoguo, from Hefei, Anhui, was urinating next to the entrance of the Huiming Flashlight Battery Factory on Qu Zhenren Road when he was stopped by the factory's accountant, leading to a conflict. The security guard Yan Yinhe's attempt to mediate was unsuccessful. A large group of workers from Anhui then used axes, iron bars, and other weapons to injure several people and rob a No. 4479 rifle from the security team. Police officers from the Second District arrested ten assailants and recovered the stolen rifle. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e188">Cause of the Incident <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>The Huiming Flashlight Battery Factory at 585 Qu Zhenren Road, Zhizaoju Road, Nanshi, is owned by Ding Xiongzhao, a member of the Municipal Security Team from Wuxi, and others. It is a large-scale operation employing over sixty male and female workers, with a very successful business. However, the factory is located in a remote area, and people often urinate at the entrance, making it unsightly. Yesterday morning at 9:30 AM, Ding Shousong, the factory's accountant from Wuxi, saw Zhou Daoguo, an Anhui worker residing in Jinxiu Lane, Zhizaoju Road, urinating again at the factory entrance. Ding Shousong went to stop him, but Zhou refused, leading to a dispute. At that time, the flashlight factory workers were starting their shift and came out to stop him. The Anhui textile factory workers nearby, thinking that their fellow villager was being humiliated, blew a whistle and gathered their fellow workers, each carrying iron bars, axes, wooden sticks, etc., and attacked the flashlight factory workers, resulting in a major clash. Outnumbered, the battery factory workers reported to the First Defense Team of the Fifth Brigade of the Runan Road Security Team and requested assistance. Yan Yinhe, the team's guard, rushed to the scene to mediate with the Anhui workers after receiving the report, but the mediation was unsuccessful. The guard was slashed with an axe in several places and had a No. 4479 rifle stolen.</p>

<h3 id="e193">Nanjing Municipal Chamber of Commerce Petitions the Legislative Yuan to Amend the Partnership Article of the Civil Code, and Replies to the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce for Information <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce previously telegraphed various chambers of commerce, requesting joint advocacy for the amendment of Article 681 of the Debt Section of the Civil Code, in response to a petition from the Chongqing Chamber of Commerce. The Nanjing Municipal Chamber of Commerce replied yesterday, stating: "Respectfully replying, your previous telegram stated that the Chongqing Chamber of Commerce's letter argued that Article 681 of the Civil Code, which stipulates that partners are jointly responsible for partnership debts, is difficult to implement and requested joint advocacy and amendment by the Legislative Yuan. This has been received. The matter is of great importance to the future of commerce and must be strongly advocated to eliminate obstacles. In addition to submitting a petition to the Legislative Yuan for amendment, a copy of the petition is enclosed for your information. Respectfully addressed to the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce of the Republic of China." The enclosed copy of the petition to the Legislative Yuan states: "Petitioning for a matter. We believe that national legislation must be in harmony with the common customs of society in order to be implemented effectively. Achieving fairness ensures equal benefits and harms, while failing to do so reverses the balance. Therefore, matters concerning the business operations of merchants require careful consideration and legal protection. However, upon examining the current Article 681 of the Debt Section of the Civil Code, which states that if partnership assets are insufficient to settle partnership debts, the partners shall be jointly and severally liable for the deficit, we are deeply concerned and feel compelled to express our views. While the interests of partners in a business are inherently linked, there must be appropriate limitations. If profits are distributed according to shares, but losses result in unlimited joint and several liability, the rights and obligations are clearly disparate, lacking equality. The legislative intent seems solely to protect creditors' rights, without considering the potential burdens on partners in the future, which is somewhat unbalanced. As representatives of the commercial community of Nanjing, we feel obligated to speak out. We respectfully petition your honorable Yuan to review and approve the appropriate amendment of Article 681 of the Debt Section of the Civil Code to ensure fairness and promote commercial development. We eagerly await your decision." - Cao Gexian, Wu Zhenxiu, Mu Huaxuan, Ran Xizhang, Du Zhe'an, Standing Committee Members of the Reorganization Committee of the Nanjing Municipal Chamber of Commerce.</p>

<p>The International Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, in order to promote the sale of Chinese silk abroad, previously convened representatives from major silk weaving factories in this city to discuss improvement measures at the bureau. It was decided to improve the quality of thin silk, conduct direct transactions, and not easily rely on foreign merchants to avoid being manipulated by them. It is now learned that although the silk factories have agreed to improve, the foreign market has not yet paid attention. Therefore, in addition to sending letters to chambers of commerce in Europe and the United States, it is also necessary to contact major silk factories to jointly form a permanent promotion organization in order to restore the decline of China's silk industry. It is currently in the planning stage, and once everything is ready, it will be officially organized and established.</p>

<p>The Shangchuan long-distance bus, which runs between Qingning Temple in Pudong and Chuansha, originally took one and a half hours for each trip. Recently, the company replaced the steam engine, increasing the speed, and plans to shorten the travel time to one hour per trip to facilitate transportation. A trial run began on the 16th of last month to test the results. The assessment for one month has been smooth, so it has been decided to continue with this method. The company is also actively renovating the facilities at each station. It is planned to issue round-trip tickets after the Qingning Temple and Chuansha stations are renovated. It is said that the ticket price will be slightly discounted, saving passengers time and money, and they hope it will be implemented soon. It is also learned that due to the shortening of daylight hours, the company will, as usual, reduce one bus from Chuansha Station at 7:00 AM and 5:00 PM, and one bus from Qingning Temple Station at 8:00 AM and 6:00 PM, starting from October 16th. However, on Mondays, Chuansha Station will add a bus at 7:00 AM, and Qingning Temple Station will add a bus at 8:00 AM.</p>

<p>Du Yifang, the owner of Lichangchunjisha, a yarn shop in Ruilin Lane, Aiduya Road, secretly sold "Lima Brand" Japanese yarn produced by the Japanese-owned Dakang Yarn Factory, pretending it was "Ren Zhong Brand" national yarn produced by the Shenxin Yarn Factory, and sold it to Dingxin Dyeing and Weaving Factory. He also altered the Lima Brand tax bill to Ren Zhong Brand, thus deceiving them. Later, Dingxin planned to transport the goods to Ningbo and requested the tax bureau to verify the transport permit, which led to the discovery. Sun Xinzhu, the manager of Dingxin, negotiated with Du, but Du shirked responsibility in every way. Sun then hired lawyer Min Ganghou to file a criminal self-accusation against Du, accusing him of forging tax bills, defrauding taxes, damaging reputation, and harming credit, and requesting severe punishment according to the law, as well as compensation for all losses. The First Special District Court has repeatedly summoned him, but the defendant has never appeared in court. It was ordered that the plaintiff be directed to arrest and bring the defendant to justice, which has been reported in this newspaper. Now, the plaintiff, Sun Xinzhu, has tried to investigate Du Yifang's hiding place, which is in the area under the jurisdiction of the Hongkou police station. The day before yesterday evening, Sun led detectives from the police station to the address secretly, but Du was well-informed and escaped in advance, so they returned empty-handed and failed to capture him. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu Tingqi continued the hearing, and lawyer Min explained the situation and presented a letter, saying that this letter was sent by the defendant to the plaintiff from the post office, but the whereabouts of the defendant are still unknown. Judge Wu ruled that the case could not be heard yet and ordered that the defendant's address be ascertained and reported to the court before setting another hearing date.</p>

Yesterday morning, at around 11:30, Ren had nothing much to do, so he slowly walked to the factory gate to look around and sat down with a member of the security team stationed at the factory, chatting and laughing. While they were talking, the security team member took out his handgun to wipe it. When Ren saw it, he eagerly wanted to take the gun to play with it. The team member, knowing that there were six bullets in it, removed them. Unexpectedly, one bullet remained inside, which the team member did not notice at the time. When he pulled the trigger, a bullet suddenly fired out, hitting Ren Zhiqin below his left breast. He immediately fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. The team member was shocked and horrified when he suddenly caused the disaster. Fortunately, the workers in the factory heard the noise and came out to see. They quickly sent Ren to Baolong Hospital for treatment. The bullet has not yet been removed, and his life is in danger.</p>

<p>Yang Shaocheng, from Chaozhou, lives at No. 11 Yuqingli, Xizilaihuo Street, French Concession. He made his fortune by dealing in opium and accumulated hundreds of thousands of dollars. He has a son named Fei, courtesy name Fengcheng, who is 25 years old this year. Relying on his father's wealth, he often seeks pleasure outside. Before the January 28th Incident in Shanghai, he met Chen Wenying, a woman from Changzhou, through a friend's introduction. She is 24 years old this year. They fell in love at first sight and felt they had met too late. The two developed from friendship to love, and then rented a house together at No. 9 Yongxiangli, Beiler Road. At the end of last year, they moved to No. 5 Xiangkangli, Baike Road. After the two lived together, their relationship became more and more intimate, like husband and wife. Around April of this year, Yang Fengcheng suddenly left home on the pretext of going out and never returned. He also stopped providing living expenses. Wenying had no choice but to move to a small sister's place at No. 24 Zhilanfang, Kaizi'er Road. On the 8th of last month, Wenying happened to go to Lafei Garden Ballroom with her small sister for entertainment. She unintentionally saw Yang Fengcheng also in the ballroom, dancing with Wen Hua, a prostitute from the Xiao Qiao Hong Brothel. Wenying was very angry when she saw this and went forward to reason with Yang. Yang not only did not comfort her but instead instigated ruffians to beat Wenying violently, causing her injury. Wenying reported to the police station and went to Kuanmin Hospital on Luban Road, where Dr. Sun Kuanmin treated her until she recovered. Wenying was filled with anger and hired lawyer Lu Dingkui to file a complaint against Yang Fengcheng for assault in the Second Special District Court. After a hearing, the defendant did not appear, so the hearing was postponed to yesterday morning. Judge Sun Pengxian interrogated the case in the Second Criminal Court. The plaintiff and her lawyer appeared in court, but the defendant still did not appear. Lawyers Jiang Yiping and Xiang Xun appeared on his behalf and said that the defendant was out of town and could not appear in court. They requested that the hearing be postponed. The plaintiff's lawyer said that the defendant was intentionally absent and requested that an arrest warrant be issued to bring him to court for interrogation. Judge Sun ordered that the case be postponed to the 17th and ordered the defendant to surrender to the court for another hearing.</p>

Later, because the lottery tickets were suspended, the store also closed down for a while. Now, because the Ministry of Finance is issuing aviation lottery tickets for the construction of aviation highways, Mr. Ding is still selling them at the old site in order to facilitate the sales of aviation tickets. However, because the same brand name has been found in the city, the Laodali brand name has added an old character to distinguish it. Therefore, since the reopening, people have gone to buy tickets at the same time. In the past few days, the household limit has been worn. It is heard that the amount of tickets sold daily has reached more than 110, which can be said to be prosperous.</p>

<p>The Terror Mega-Hit "King Kong" Opens Today. "King Kong" is one of RKO Pictures' special mega-hits. When it was premiered in the UK, it attracted more than 500,000 viewers. In New York, 12 theaters premiered the film simultaneously, and the audience was like a tide. The grand scene was unprecedented. The King Kong in the film is a giant gorilla with a height of 50 feet and thick limbs. Other monsters such as giant bats, snake-headed elephant-bodied monsters, and evil dragons are all huge, terrifying, and scary. The whole film is full of terror and tension, and it is shocking to the soul. When the monsters wrestle, the sun and moon lose their color and the world moves.

The performance of the protagonist, Warner Krauss, is profound, resolute, sharp, and vivid, and he is indeed worthy of being a veteran of the European silver screen.</p>

The top five results for the first half of the decathlon are: 1st place, Shanghai's Chen Baoqiu with 3156.70 points; 2nd place, Beiping's Zhang Lingjia with 3106.882 points; 3rd place, Shanghai's Chen Ling with 2907.7758 points; 4th place, Hebei's Zhao Enhui with 2901.345 points; 5th place, Shandong's Liu Mengling with 2693.330 points.</p>

<p>There were 45 participants in the pentathlon. The competition was extremely complicated due to too many groups. It started in the afternoon and only finished at 7 PM. The 1500-meter event in the afternoon was held in near darkness. A lamp was placed around the field, and the starter and finish line judges used lights as signals. It was truly a spectacle of an unprecedented competition. As a result of the competition, Shanghai's Hao Chunde won the championship, while Wang Jihuai finished second with a difference of eight points. Hao and Wang's scores both exceeded 3,000 points. Both Hao and Wang broke the national record. Hao and Wang are the first to break 3,000 points in the Chinese pentathlon. Hao's long jump in the first event did not reach his maximum potential. Hao's javelin throw in the first throw reached the highest record, and the 200-meter time of 23.2 seconds was also excellent. However, Hao's average in the discus and 1500-meter events was not as good as Wang Jihuai's. The scores of the third and fourth places were much lower than Hao and Wang's.</p>
<h3 id="e217">Still Lower than Far Eastern Record <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>The highest Far Eastern record is 2838 points, but this is based on the old scoring method, which is much lower than the current scoring method. Therefore, although Hao and Wang's scores exceed the Far Eastern record, they cannot be considered Far Eastern records. If Hao and Wang's scores were calculated using the old scoring method, they would still be far below the Far Eastern record.</p>

The time of 3 minutes 31.8 seconds is a new national record. In the 400-meter relay preliminary, which was divided into two groups, the first group was won by Guangdong, followed by Liaoning and Beijing, with a time of 45.4 seconds, a new national record. In the second group, Shanghai was first, followed by Beiping and Hebei. Shanghai's last runner, Hao Chunde, did not push hard for time, finishing in 45.6 seconds. In the final, they can beat Guangdong and create a better record.</p>

<p>(Nanjing, 14th) With Hao and Wang already in the top two spots in the pentathlon, and the Shanghai team also winning the 1600-meter relay, the Shanghai team is secure in the all-around championship. As for the "Iron Bull" Chen Baoqiu, due to his good average scores in each event, he changed from the pentathlon to participate in the decathlon. His total score in the first half is the first, which is particularly commendable. The scores for the all-around competition yesterday are as follows:</p>
<p>Shanghai: 26 points</p>
<p>Beiping: 6 points</p>
<p>Fujian: 4 points</p>

<p>(Nanjing, 14th) In the all-around competition, the 1600-meter relay race was originally scheduled to have three preliminary groups, but because only six teams participated, it was directly changed to the final. At the start, Beiping was in the lead, but the Shanghai team surpassed them in the second leg. The Beiping, Fujian, and Beijing teams were constantly changing positions, making the competition extremely fierce. By the third leg, the Shanghai team had surpassed them by 30 meters, and Zeng Rongzhong, the fourth leg runner, widened the lead to about 60 meters, advancing easily. As a result, Shanghai was first, Beiping was second, Fujian was third, and Beijing was fourth. The time of 3 minutes 31.5 seconds is a new national record. The Shanghai team members were Su Xiaoru in the first leg, Liu Fukang in the second leg, Li Yanxiang in the third leg, and Zeng Rongzhong in the fourth leg.

<p>(Nanjing, 14th) The 400-meter relay preliminary in the all-around competition was held in two groups.</p>
<p>First Group</p>
<p>The first group consisted of five teams: Liaoning, Ningxia, Nanjing, Gansu, and Guangdong. At the start, the Guangdong team took the lead with Zhong Lianji running the first leg. The Nanjing team was second, and the Liaoning team was third. By the fourth leg, the Liaoning team had been surpassed by the Guangdong team by more than 20 meters. Fortunately, Liu Changchun ran this leg. Mr. Liu used his swift legs to chase forward, surpassing Beijing and then chasing Guangdong. He ultimately failed by half a meter at the finish line. The Guangdong team was able to win because of their talent. Liaoning was second, and Beijing was third. The time of 45.4 seconds broke the national record. The team members were Zhong Yunjie, He Peigen, Zhu Zhongxi, and Zhao Bingheng.</p>

<p>The second group consisted of four teams: Fujian, Shanghai, Beiping, and Hebei. The Shanghai team was the strongest, with Su Xiaoru running the first leg, Dong Yinchu running the second leg, Cheng Jinguan running the third leg, and Hao Chunde running the fourth leg. In the end, they surpassed the Beiping team by about 20 meters. The Hebei team was third. The time was 45 seconds.</p>
<h3 id="e226">### Many Changes Still to Come in the Decathlon: First Half Exceeds 3,000 Points; National Record Will Inevitably Be Broken; Liaoning's Liu Renxiu Abandons the Race <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 14th) Chen Baoqiu, Zhang Lingjia, Chen Ling, Liu Mengling, Zhao Enhui, and others had the best results in the first half of the decathlon. However, the conference announced the scores late on the 14th, only calculating the scores of the best performers. It is expected that there will be considerable changes in the second half. In short, the champion will be either Zhang Lingjia of Beiping or Chen Baoqiu of Shanghai. However, Liu Renxiu, who holds the national record, only attended the 100-meter event on the 14th. After running 11.8 seconds, he disappeared without a trace, giving up the race. Many people are confused. Now, the scores of Shanghai's Chen Baoqiu and Beiping's Zhang Lingjia in the first half have exceeded 3,000 points, and the national record is likely to be broken. Shanghai's Chen Ling currently has more than 2,900 points, and his scores in the javelin and pole vault will definitely be high, so there is a good chance of catching up.</p>

<p>(Nanjing, 14th) At 10:00 AM on the 14th, the Competition Committee and Review Committee of the National Games held a joint meeting at the Central Hotel. Those present were Gao Zi, Ma Yuehan, Wang Zhengting, Dong Shouyi, Shen Siliang, Wu Bangwei, Zhang Xinfu, Chu Minyi, Wu Yunyu, Hao Gengsheng, Zhang Boling, and Yuan Dunli. Those attending as observers were Huang Bobin, Rong Qizhao, Li Wenchang, and Guan Songsheng. (1) The chairman reported that the judgment of the results of the men's 10,000-meter final on the 13th was based on the oral report of lap counter Huang Bobin. After reviewing the record sheets of the lap counters, the record of No. 180 (Jin Zhongkang), who was recorded as the first place in the 10,000-meter race, was only recorded by Huang Bobin and Li Wenchang. Li's record showed that No. 180 only ran 19 laps. Huang's record showed that he ran 21 laps. Running 21 laps is impossible. Therefore, there was indeed an error in Huang's record. How should it be decided? Please express your opinions. Then, lap counters Huang and Li gave separate reports. (It was generally believed that there was an error in Huang's record. Finally, Huang stated that if another person was responsible for recording the laps for No. 180, then his record could be canceled.) 1. Shen Siliang proposed accepting Li Wenchang's record as the official record. Wang Zhengting seconded the motion. The chairman called for a vote, and it passed.</p>
<h3 id="e228">Jiangsu Files Another Protest <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>According to the joint meeting of the Competition Committee and Review Committee's decision, Gu Desheng of Shanxi took first place in the 10,000-meter race, Wang Zhenglin of Shanghai took second place, Wang Huibin of Shanxi took third place, and Liu Dehua of Shandong took fourth place. The time was 34 minutes 47 and 2/5 seconds. Jin Zhongkang of Jiangsu only ran 19 laps and was eliminated. Because the track is 500 meters per lap, it is calculated as running 20 laps. After the joint meeting's records were announced at 2:00 PM on the 14th, Zhang Dongping, the head of the Jiangsu team, protested to Ma Yuehan again. The dispute over the 10,000-meter race is still difficult to resolve.</p>
<h3 id="e229">Jiangsu's Written Protest Last Night Contains Five Points <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 14th) Zhang Dongping, the head of the Jiangsu team, filed a written protest with the refereeing committee on the 14th regarding the second judgment in the 10,000-meter race, and paid a deposit of ten yuan. The original letter stated: "The resolution of the joint meeting of the Competition Committee and Review Committee, regarding the men's 10,000-meter final on the 13th, stated that there was indeed an error in the record of No. 180, who was recorded as the first place, and that Li Wenchang's record would be the official record. Now, according to Article 18 of the competition rules, this unit submits the following protest: (1) Before the start of the 10,000-meter race, there were more athletes than lap counters. After the lap counters were assigned numbers, there were still two athletes without lap counters. The finish line judge designated Huang Bobin to record No. 180, and Li Jiyuan to record another person (Fujian). Some referees witnessed this and can be called as witnesses if necessary. This proves that Huang Bobin was undoubtedly designated by the finish line judge to be responsible for counting the laps for No. 180. Why is it that after the refereeing results were announced, there was a report from Li Wenchang also recording No. 180? This is the first point of protest. (2) When the finish line judge announced that No. 180 was in first place, he stated that it was based on the evidence from the lap counter, timer, and starter. Why is it different today? This is the second point of protest. (3) The joint meeting stated that there was indeed an error in Huang's record of No. 180 running 21 laps. However, according to Huang, the number 21 on the record sheet was crossed out early with a line. How could there be 21 laps? This can be verified. This is the third point of protest. (4) During the joint meeting of the competition referee committee, Wang Zhengting stated that he did not pay attention to No. 180 in the first ten laps, but he was sure that he was closely following in the lead after the tenth lap and did not fall behind in the last two laps. Because it was dusk, he did not pay attention. Committee member Wang's moral character is admired by all, and his words are worthy of study. This is the fourth point of protest. (5) Yesterday's 10,000-meter final was closely watched by reporters from various newspapers. Each newspaper in Shanghai had detailed reports of who was leading in which lap and who took the lead in which lap. The facts were ignored, and yesterday's judgment by the finish line judge was overturned. This is the fifth point of protest. Based on the above points, regarding sporting events and refereeing ethics, we ask your committee to seriously consider and review the matter to reach a fair judgment."</p>

<h3 id="e232">After the 10,000m Rankings Correction, Various Parties Expressed Injustice for Jiangsu: Jin Zhongkang in First Place Extremely Obvious Fact, Said a Certain Sports Figure <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the dispute that occurred in the 10,000m Final on the 13th, this newspaper has already published a very detailed account. However, today, a certain famous sports figure who places the utmost importance on sportsmanship told a reporter that he (this sports figure, hereinafter referred to as such) was present throughout the 10,000m Final and paid close attention to Jin Zhongkang's lap count, which was absolutely correct. Jin's championship was an extremely obvious fact. It was only after Gu Desheng of Shanxi failed to win the championship that he believed the lap counter for Jin had made a mistake. In the evening, the Shanxi representatives gathered to warn the finish line judges, Ma Yuehan, Dong Shouyi, etc., that they must overturn the record and award first place to Gu; if they did not, they would take drastic measures. Upon hearing this, the finish line judge was extremely alarmed. Northern China leaders, including Dong Shouyi and the head referee Zhang Boling, etc., secretly convened a meeting late at night to discuss how to deal with the situation. They then decided to find a way to overturn the original judgment made on the spot. During the joint meeting of the Competition Committee on the morning of the 14th, they made a powerful proposal, which was successful. Gu Desheng of Shanxi was awarded first place again, Wang Zhenglin of Shanghai was awarded second place, Wang Huibin of Shanxi was awarded third place, and Liu Dehua of Shandong was awarded fourth place. Speaking objectively, Jiangsu suffered an excessive loss. The fact is that Jin Zhongkang was first, but now Jin has no place, which is embarrassing. The finish line judges are also suspected of bias. Because they are all from Northern China, they believe that Shanxi is not easy to offend, while Jiangsu is easy to suppress. Therefore, it must be said that this is a major stain on the character of the event's referees. Although I am not from Jiangsu, I deeply feel injustice for Jiangsu, he said.</p>
<h3 id="e233">Speech by Mr. Wu Bangwei <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>According to Mr. Wu Bangwei, Jin Zhongkang's first place was an extremely obvious fact, but the finish line judge convened a meeting the next day and overturned the original decision, re-awarding Gu Desheng of Shanxi first place. This fact is strange. I do not comment on whether the referees had any bias. The Jiangsu side is willing to take a loss and does not want to engage in meaningless arguments to maintain sportsmanship.</p>
<h3 id="e234">Letter from Another Source <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>The reporter also received a letter from another source, which stated: "Today, on the 13th, a dispute occurred in the 10,000m race. One reason was that the time was too late, and the other reason was that the lap counters were arranged in a long line on both sides of the track, which was very inconvenient for the judging work. I believe that (the author of this article stated) the position of the lap counters in the first few laps does not need to be considered. In the final lap, the lap counters for the top ten or fifteen runners should stand on the track, and the other lap counters should all stand inside the inner circle of the track. After the gun is fired for the last lap, all the numbers that have passed the last lap should be reported, and the finish line judge should record them. Positions must be reserved for the timers and the finish line judges to judge the order of the runners. If the lap counters determine the order of the runners, it is inevitable that disputes like today's and those in the past will occur. I wonder what those with experience in judging think? As for today's matter, the onlookers are different and all base their opinions on their own subjective views, arguing over right and wrong. I know that the athletes must be very clear in their hearts, knowing who is beating me and where to laugh. If the athletes can come out, in accordance with the spirit of sportsmanship, and explain the true facts, it will not only eliminate the doubts of most people in this competition, but also resolve the misunderstandings of the previous Hangzhou Games. However, is there any such athlete who truly respects sportsmanship and takes action?"</p>

<p>Chairman Zhang Boling, with Zhou Jiaqi as the recorder, first reported that the National Sports Federation's board of directors had been established for nine years but had not been re-elected due to the imperfect membership units, which had affected the federation's work. However, the federation's past work had made significant contributions to national sports. Due to the federation's imperfect organization, taking advantage of the opening of the National Games in Nanjing, everyone will discuss how to revise the constitution, re-elect the board of directors, etc.</p>

He proposed revising Articles 3 and 4 of the constitution regarding membership qualifications and directors. In the end, it was resolved that (1) the members of the federation would be the provinces, cities, and special regions of the country; (2) Article 4 would be revised so that one-third of the nine directors would be re-elected every two years, and they could be re-elected consecutively; (3)</p>

<p>(Nanjing, 14th Dispatch) In the second match, Shanghai versus Hunan, it was expected that the Shanghai team, renowned for its reputation, would defeat Hunan. However, Shanghai's teamwork was not as coordinated as when they were in Shanghai. Individual skills were certainly strong. After the start, Shanghai took the lead all the way. The Hunan team offered no resistance: 1-0, 4-0, soaring upwards, winning the first quarter 16-0. In the second quarter, Hunan remained the same, unable to attack or defend. Shanghai pressed forward relentlessly, feinting east and attacking west. Yang Sen played with ease, ending the first half with a score of 29-0. In the second half, the Shanghai team made significant personnel adjustments, but their momentum remained strong. Hunan's Ou Qiong-ru scored one basket, and Chen Shoujie made one free throw, avoiding a complete shutout. Shanghai's Chen Jucai was steady and fast, worthy of being called an all-rounder. Liu Machuan was tall and strong, with excellent reception skills, significantly increasing the score. At the end of the third quarter, Shanghai led Hunan 18-3. In the fourth quarter, Hunan missed good opportunities under the basket and became discouraged. The Shanghai team overwhelmingly defeated Hunan 60-3. The referee was Song Junfu.</p>

<p>(Nanjing, 14th Dispatch) In the first women's basketball match, the Fujian-Jiangxi game, the strength of the two sides was disparate, with little excitement. The Fujian team had once defeated the famous Liangjiang team and indeed lived up to their reputation. Xue Pixia was short and nimble, Chen Sangtang was agile, and You Huifang's shooting was accurate, worthy of being called excellent players. After Jiangxi scored one point through an accidental ball, they were at a loss. Fujian was unstoppable in their offensive. Fujian scored another two points from free throws, which was not easy. In the first quarter, Fujian won 17-3. In the second quarter, Fujian's forwards became more agile. When the score reached 30-4, Jiangxi's commander-in-chief Shi Jingyi threw in two points from the crowd. At the end of the first half, Fujian led 34-6. From the second half onwards, Fujian scored repeatedly, while Jiangxi scored nothing. In the third quarter, Fujian won by a net 17 points. In the fourth quarter, Fujian's forwards coordinated effectively. Chen Rongtang jumped like a flying bird and was an indispensable talent. The defense was even more solid, winning 26-0. The final result was 80-6. Fujian won decisively. The referee was Shu Hong.</p>

<p>(Nanjing, 14th Dispatch) Nanjing and Hunan competed in the women's volleyball preliminary round at 9:00 this morning. The Hunan team, with their powerful physiques, excelled in skills such as serving, blocking, and spiking.</p>
<h3 id="e246">Heavy Troops Pressing In <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>At the beginning of the match, Hunan scored three points first. Nanjing was unwilling to be outdone. Shi Jiazhen's serve was effective, scoring three points in a row. The Hunan team's Zuo Jiuyu received and tried to attack, but the ball went high and out of bounds, resulting in no good points. Nanjing's score continued to increase. In the first half, they won 11-10. In the second half, Nanjing rose again, heavily pressing the Hunan team, winning 21-16 first.</p>
<h3 id="e247">Defensive Line Shakes <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>From the second game onwards, Nanjing's middle blockers found the incoming balls from Hunan to be fast and heavy, and their defensive line shook. In the first half, they completely lost their defenses, changing sides with a score of 3-11. In the second half, the veteran Zhang Yinfen devised a plan on the spot, firmly instructing the team to calm down and focus on defense first, then attack. However, the Hunan team's aggression remained, and it was impossible to recover. Thus, they suffered a major defeat of 6-21.</p>

<p>In the third game, Hunan saw the weakness and consistently attacked with full force, both front and back. Nanjing was exhausted, and often failed to save the ball when it was coming. Thus, they lost again 8-21.</p>

<p>(Nanjing, 14th Dispatch) The Hebei women's softball team is famous in North China and has a remarkable record in the North China Games. However, in the match against the Nanjing team at 9:00 this morning, they suffered a major defeat of 2-17. This shows that the Nanjing team's strength cannot be ignored. As the battle began, Hebei attacked first, but with no success. Three Nanjing players occupied each base. Chen Shufeng got a hit, and they scored four points successively. In the second inning, Hebei's Liu Youqiang ran and scored one point. Nanjing then launched an attack. Due to Hebei's scattered formation and repeated errors, the Nanjing team scored another four points. In the third inning, Hebei's momentum suddenly increased, and all three bases were occupied. However, they failed to hit the ball and missed the opportunity, only scoring one point. The Nanjing team's strong hits were formidable, and Hebei could not defend against them. Nanjing's Lu Gou scored a home run. In this inning, Nanjing scored as many as seven points. In the fourth inning, Hebei again scored nothing. Nanjing's He Xiujun and Yuan Chengssen each scored one point. In the final inning, Hebei scored zero and did not hit. The result was a 17-2 victory.</p>

<p>(Nanjing, 14th Dispatch) The second week of the men's basketball tournament started at 9:00 AM on the 14th, with a total of two games. The first was Sichuan versus Hubei. The strength of both sides was average, and the difference in the outcome depended entirely on the shift in momentum and temporary luck. As a result, Sichuan committed repeated fouls, creating a self-inflicted disaster, and was defeated by Hubei 50-29. The second game was the highly anticipated debut of the Philippine Overseas Chinese team, who showed their brilliant skills and easily defeated Jiangsu, earning enthusiastic praise from the audience, winning 47-23.</p>

<p>The Sichuan-Hubei match began, and its equal technique and close score aroused great interest among the audience. However, the performance was not particularly exciting. Hubei's Wang Yide's technique was flexible, and his throws were accurate, repeatedly making great contributions. Gu Tianquan and Pei Zhongze were the most valiant. The entire team was average and the teamwork was pure, so they often took the lead. Hubei struggled hard, not wanting to be outdone. When the break time arrived, the score was tied at 17.</p>
<h3 id="e255">Second Half: Winds of Change <a href="#e255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>As the second half started, the momentum was very rampant. The three forwards made contributions to each other, and their wonderful passing won a lot of applause. On the other hand, the Hubei team's formation was scattered, with disordered advances and retreats. Sichuan once led 24-17. Seeing this situation, it was thought that Sichuan would lay the foundation for a major victory. Unexpectedly, repeated fouls were committed. Gu Wenquan, Pei Zhongze, and Lou Zhanghua, three key players, were successively fouled out, and the situation changed dramatically. From then on, Hubei took advantage of the power and went straight ahead. The score soared upwards, winning 40-29.</p>

<p>In the next match, the Philippine Overseas Chinese team faced Jiangsu. The Philippines has always been famous. They had previously fought in the United States and had defeated the Philippine champion team, Ju Tuomai Si. On the 14th, they showed their skills for the first time in the National Games. Although their opponent Jiangsu was also of mediocre talent, the strength of the two teams was disparate. The Philippines passed the ball wonderfully, and their shooting accuracy was rare. They only missed two of all free throws. As a result, the Philippines won 47-23.</p>
<h3 id="e257">Philippine Team's Artistry <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>The Philippine team's personnel were average, their movements were clean and polished, the best of all the teams. Their technique was pure, and their feints were unpredictable. When the ball entered the basket area, it was surrounded by four people, leaping and throwing, skillfully extraordinary. When throwing the ball inbounds under the basket, they raised the ball high, and the three players lurking under the basket jumped up and tapped it in, often with miraculous results. If they encountered a tall defender on the other side, this method would suffer. The guards were experienced in stealing the ball, and their movements were excellent. The rest of the players were also average and pleasing. The shouts for them to win the championship were very high.</p>
<h3 id="e258">Competition Overview <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>In the first half, the Philippines first used five substitutes to play, with few exciting performances. However, Jiangsu already felt it was difficult to deal with them, and they were extraordinarily strenuous. The spectators who did not know the team's lineup thought that they were nothing more than that. After about ten minutes of fighting, the full official lineup was mobilized, and from then on, they were like a mighty force, unstoppable. The passing was like a machine, and the shooting was like a string of beads. The Jiangsu team's score stopped, and they became discouraged. More than ten minutes into the second half, the Philippines brought on the substitutes again, resulting in a score of 47-23.</p>

<p>The Philippine team's uniform was extremely bright, wearing eye-catching red, green, and white three-color uniforms, with the words "Philippine Overseas Chinese" embroidered on their chests. The audience applauded like thunder, expressing their respect. The referees Xu Zhendong and Li Zuqi ordered the mobilization. Because the Philippine side used substitutes, the work did not seem tight. Jiangsu fought desperately, and the situation was still average. When the score was 11-8, and the Philippines had the advantage, they switched to the official lineup. From then on, it was like a whirlwind sweeping away fallen leaves. The Jiangsu team was at a loss, and cheers rose from all around from time to time. The first half ended 24-8. From the second half onwards, Jiangsu made some progress from time to time. Ji Yubiao made two long shots, and Jin Youde also scored four points. The Philippine team rose straight up to 35-13, and the second-rate players took the field again, ending this one-sided situation.</p>

Li Gongyu made another contribution, leading Nanjing 6-0. Heilongjiang saw that the situation was not good and called a time-out to discuss strategy. Cui Xiangdong indeed scored. Nanjing's Li Gongyu returned the favor. There were many mixed battles, and each side gained something. Nanjing's Wei Haiqing entered the field, and the situation suddenly turned favorable. Heilongjiang also became more and more valiant, and the score difference was between two and three points. At the end of the first half, Nanjing had 20 points and Heilongjiang had 16 points.</p>

<p>Hebei-Hubei Battle Process</p>

<h3 id="e263">Goalkeeper Injured, Resisting a Strong Enemy <a href="#e263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>At the beginning of the match, the Hebei army fiercely attacked the city. Hubei's defense was often worried, but due to the goalkeeper's dedication, they were able to turn danger into safety. At the twelfth minute, the Hebei army's forward attacked to the edge of the city again. The ball bounced fast like a fire, and the goalkeeper embraced it with both hands, but was knocked down by the enemy. The ball bounced on his abdomen, and he fainted to the ground. He was rescued off the field, and Dai Jiwu replaced him as goalkeeper. He recovered from his injury and returned to the field until the fortieth minute. He was brave and commendable. In the last five minutes, Hubei's defensive situation was extremely dangerous. There was a penalty corner kick, and the ball went out of bounds near the goal five or six times, but was still saved by the goalkeeper. The first half ended 0-0, with no winner.</p>
<h3 id="e264">Once the Tide Turns, It's Hard to Recover <a href="#e264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>The second half started, and within five minutes, the Hebei left inside forward scored one goal, opening the scoring. Soon after, the left winger Jiang Lu shot one ball from a distance, and the army's momentum became stronger and stronger, pressing towards Hubei. Hubei defended tirelessly. At the thirtieth minute, the Hebei center forward scored another goal, and the declining situation became even more difficult to recover. Finally, Hubei's inside forward scored one goal in return, making the score 3-1. The total score was 3-1, Hebei won.</p>

<p>(Nanjing, 14th Dispatch) In the soccer match at 4 PM on the 14th, Guangdong defeated Nanjing 15-1 and will play against Hebei in the semi-final at 2 PM on the 17th. Guangdong is an outstanding team, and the Nanjing team's skills are only average, so they were no match for them. However, no one expected the score to reach such a high point.</p>
<h3 id="e266">First-Class Talents Show Their Skills <a href="#e266" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c266" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">266</a></h3>
<p>The referee Chen Jixiang blew the whistle, and the battle began. The Guangdong army, with first-class talents such as Zhu Guolun, Ye Beihua, Mai Su, and Hu Tiansai, attacked with legitimate short passes. The Nanjing team resisted desperately. After about three minutes of stalemate, Zhu Guolun's cannonball hit the goal net, opening the scoring. After that, Luo Mai, Hu, and Yang successively captured, and the score continued to increase. The Nanjing team was discouraged, and their feet slipped repeatedly. The goalkeeper could not fulfill his duties, so the first half ended 9-0.</p>
<h3 id="e267">God Blesses People, Avoiding a Complete Shutout <a href="#e267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>During the break, the Nanjing team's strategist gave instructions and strategies. After they entered the field, the army's morale was indeed boosted. Everyone fought desperately, and everyone gave their lives. The Guangdong army's offensive began to weaken slightly. Wu took the opportunity to go straight in. Mai Sen's long shot and Hu Tianjin's quick approach were especially terrifying. Bian Ji reported in distress from time to time. At 5:00 PM, the Nanjing team suddenly switched to an offensive, crashing and rushing straight in, fighting the Guangdong army in close combat. Indeed, God blessed those who worked hard. In the last seven minutes, the Nanjing left winger got the ball and dribbled in. The inside guard Zhong kicked it. Huang Jiliang was slightly negligent, and the ball gently rolled into the net. The stands erupted with cheers, with some shouting for another one. Not long after, Guangdong's Ye Beihua also hit one ball, and the match ended. The second half ended 6-1. The total score was 15-1. Guangdong won overwhelmingly. Thousands of people crowded the stands, all cheering for the Nanjing team. The first half ended, and the crowd knew that there was absolutely no hope of winning, so most of them left. So-called coming excitedly and leaving disappointed, it can be said to be a great disappointment.</p>

<p>(Nanjing, 10th Dispatch) Shanghai's general Qiu Feihai has not yet arrived in Beijing due to some matters, so the first singles match was played by Wang Wenzheng. Hunan's Ling Zhiyang's technique was mediocre and far from his opponent. At the beginning of the match, the outcome was immediately determined.

<p>(Nanjing, 14th Dispatch) Guangdong's Xu Huipei is of moderate height, runs quickly, and his ball skills and footwork are extremely commendable.

<p>The Hong Kong team entered the field, radiating vigor. The stands were already full. The athletes first sounded a round of drums, creating an intimidating atmosphere. As soon as Hubei arrived, the referee Tian Pei presented the challenge. The Hubei player, Tang Juzhi, announced his name first, but unexpectedly, the opponent showed no courtesy and immediately launched a deadly attack, targeting the vital points. Hong Kong's Rong Naizu fired a shot, and Hubei's Chen Fuyu dove to meet it. The ball fell through the net. Just as Chen was about to chase after it to set it up, Hong Kong's Hu Yaodong slammed it to the ground with a sharp spike. Hubei suffered consecutive hits. The first half ended 11-3. In the second half, the Hong Kong team continued their tactics, soaring upwards. The final score was 21-7. In the second game, the front and middle rows of the Hubei team defended effectively. After five minutes, Hong Kong's Zhou Yonghai and Lin Qihua stood firm, forcefully blocking and cutting, making significant contributions. The final score was 21-9. Hubei suffered consecutive defeats. In the third game, Hong Kong's Li Wo, a middle-row player, completely withdrew from the battle zone, replacing him with a new force. Hubei, inexperienced in major battles, was besieged on all sides, unable to devise a plan. They lost with a score of 7-21. The overall result was three to zero. Hong Kong's relentless and decisive performance throughout was remarkable. In the upcoming matches this week, we anticipate more outstanding and exciting performances.</p>

<p>The Shanxi-Fujian match was held on the second volleyball court. The southern athletes were much more experienced in volleyball. The Shanxi team found it difficult to resist. Therefore, no matter which side served, the ball would inevitably fall into Shanxi's territory. The first half was hastily concluded, with Fujian winning 21-2. In the second half, the northern team set up camp to attack, but gained little. In the third game, they were also flustered and overwhelmed, scoring very few points. Therefore, Fujian defeated Shanxi in a short amount of time, scoring three straight victories. The score for the second game was 21-8, and the score for the third game was 21-10.</p>

Hitting the bullseye scored 5 points, hitting the white circle scored 3 points, and hitting the blue circle scored 1 point. Except for Xu Shixiang from Peiping, who was relatively young, the competitors were all over 40 years old, some even over 60, with white beards and missing teeth, but their spirits were still strong.

<p>Yesterday was the fifth day of martial arts. In the morning, there was the men's middleweight wrestling preliminary. The athletes were heroic and high-spirited, delivering a resounding defeat to their opponents, resulting in joyous cheers. In particular, Nanjing athlete Chang Hexun wrestled exceptionally well, earning the title of "famous fighter" and receiving continuous applause. The audience cheered loudly. In the seventh match, Sun Yuxiu (Qingdao) vs. Zhou Jun (Sichuan), after several exchanges, Sun's green pant leg was torn by Zhou, revealing a white leg and a black foot, causing the entire audience to burst into laughter and nearly fall over. In addition, the Sichuan athlete did not know how to wrestle and only knew how to kick, so Sun was lured by Zhou and suffered many losses, resulting in a great defeat. The other wrestling matches, such as Sun Yingjian's, were quite well-researched and resulted in immediate victories, making them excellent matches. The morning's results are as follows:</p>

<p>The Shanghai women's volleyball team has been practicing diligently in recent days. In the preliminary round of the National Games women's volleyball competition, apart from Jiangsu and Fujian who had a bye, six matches have already concluded in sequence. The second round will begin on the 15th. The teams from Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Peiping are all formidable opponents. Shanghai will play against Fujian on the 16th, which should not pose a major problem. However, the semi-finals are just around the corner. If they are not careful, they will surely lose Jingzhou due to carelessness. Therefore, they have been intensifying their training in recent days, either mixing with the Shanghai men's volleyball team for offensive and defensive practice or playing informal matches with athletes from the Peiping team, sharpening their weapons without rest. The ambition of the Shanghai young ladies is truly gratifying for those who care about sports.</p>

<p>(Nanjing, 15th Dispatch) Yesterday, a strange person was found lying on the grass behind the temporary market at the sports meet, wearing an old Western suit and underwear, groaning. His eyes were strangely red, as if he were very tired. After being questioned by the police, he claimed to be Guo Xinghai, 24 years old, from Jinan Prefecture, Shandong, a student studying in France. His luggage was stolen on the way from Hong Kong to Shanghai, which led to his being stranded here. The day before, he had been sleeping in the Mausoleum Enclosure, and the next evening, he was lying here, very hungry. After he was given a full meal, the crowd notified the Shandong representatives to provide him with information and investigate whether he was a student studying in France. They invited someone who knew French to converse with him, and he spoke fluently. They asked him to have a full meal and inquired about his family situation, preparing to send him back home or to have him return to his hometown with the team members. Seeing the gifts given to him, Guo said that he only wanted to eat, and he did not talk about the others. The Shandong team praised his ambition, but Guo suddenly left the team and disappeared.</p>

<p>The 200-meter finals, held in the afternoon, generated high interest because of Liu Changchun's reputation and the expectation of a new record. However, the track and field authorities suddenly decided to move the race to the track in front of the east grandstand. The reason given was that the west track was uneven due to continuous running and trampling, which might hinder the breaking of a new record. Therefore, the race was moved from west to east, with no other intention. However, the reporters, numbering over a hundred, assumed that the move was because many important people were on the east grandstand, so they were ordered to move east. They gathered and stormed through the athletics field, heading straight for the east grandstand. The Boy Scouts initially refused to let them pass, saying they had not received orders. However, the crowd rushed in, and they could do nothing. Zhou Xiangxian, a member of the organizing committee, saw the situation and asked about it in a tactful manner. After learning the inside story, everyone laughed.</p>

<p>During the women's softball game on the morning of the 13th, several male athletes ran into the athletics field at the entrance of the west grandstand. The female Boy Scouts on guard tried to stop them, but they were overwhelmed and only managed to stop one person, trying to force him out. However, the male athlete pretended to leave and suddenly ran back into the field. The female Boy Scout, unaware, quickly turned around and chased after him. But the male athlete had been trained to have swift feet, and the female Boy Scout could not catch up. After chasing for about fifty meters, she returned in defeat. Those who saw it burst into laughter, saying that the female Boy Scout was acting as a "spotter". The "women's army", their faces red with embarrassment, left the field, angry and not knowing where to go.</p>

<p>The golden lance given by President Lin Sen as a prize was moved to the entrance in front of the west grandstand for photography, and the arrangement was very exquisite, worthy of its fame. Xu Yanzhi, the director of the prize department, stretched out both hands to block pedestrians to prevent them from obstructing the lens. Unexpectedly, the audience was rushing to watch the 200-meter finals, and they rushed into the venue. The director of the organizing committee was also at the entrance to maintain order. A Boy Scout commander saw the situation and rushed to the entrance to assist. Unexpectedly, Xu placed his hands on the Boy Scout commander's hands and pushed them away, regardless of everything, heading straight for the entrance. Xu was the director of the prize department, and the photography of the golden lance given by President Lin, a senior government official, was important. He glared at the Boy Scout commander, blaming him for being uncooperative. The Boy Scout commander, claiming the righteousness of maintaining order, blamed Xu in return. They argued fiercely, and Zhang Xinfu and others mediated the situation. However, one wave subsided, and another rose, arousing the anger of another Boy Scout leader. He angrily said to Zhang Xinfu, "The organizing committee is handling things like this, holding the Boy Scouts responsible. What kind of system is this? If the organizing committee cannot take responsibility, then our Boy Scouts will all withdraw!" Zhang tried his best to smooth things over, expressing goodwill, and the Boy Scout's anger subsided slightly.</p>

<p>— Qiu Yun</p>
<p>Various objects, more meaningful than in the daytime, dance in people's minds! The flashing original forms of red and green electric lights seem to be offering coquettish glances to all the elders!</p>
<p>Red and green, the softly swaying lines on the dance floor gently entangle a skinny bone on the ground.</p>
<p>In the halls of Western-style buildings, what crawls out of the windows are also some lights, a few shadows, also red and green, and also sounds: unrestrained laughter, beautiful singing, rhythmic piano sounds.</p>
<p>And from who knows where, with indistinct directions and untraceable origins, it seems that everything around is echoing each other: this kind of mixed and clamorous shouting!</p>
<p>In restaurants, the constant ringing of telephones, and beside the telephones, many young girls' hearts are beating and trembling!</p>
<p>Vehicles: cars, trams, motorcycles, like many crazy fellows, running and shouting!</p>
<p>Far and near, steamships roar!</p>
<p>The night has no moon, and the sky is patched with layers of dark clouds, densely covering it! But from a distance, it is a red sky!</p>
<h3 id="e316">Night on Nanjing Road <a href="#e316" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c316" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">316</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Renwei</p>
<p>The night on Nanjing Road is truly magnificent! Standing below Sassoon House and looking westward, one sees red neon lights shining like daylight, illuminating a tarred road, covering the ground in red; the magnificent buildings are all reflected beneath people's feet; the streetcars rushing back and forth, dashing and disappearing like flying.</p>
<p>The uplifting music inside the Cathay Hotel blows with the wind into people's eardrums; people on the street outside can see Western men and women inside, holding silver cups and casually sipping wine and Holland water. The small-time fellows who lack such fortune stare with lantern-like eye sockets, swallowing saliva in their mouths.</p>
<p>In front of the Huamao Hotel's window, two Western women are viewing various clothing samples. An old hustler, holding a copper watch in his hand, waves it back and forth in front of them in a thief-like manner, leaving the two Western women bewildered, mumbling something in their mouths.</p>
<p>A boy who looks like a houseboy, holding a stack of letters, stuffs them all into a mailbox in front of the Huilo Company, and in a flash, darts across the road like a flying arrow.</p>
<p>In front of the Wing On Company, a few prostitutes standing there suddenly become restless and start pulling customers. The one being pulled says in a low voice, "It's still early!"</p>
<p>Ah! Our Nanjing Road! You are magnificent, you are mysterious, you make people drunk, you make people linger unwilling to leave you.</p>
<h3 id="e317">Night on the Street of Mystery <a href="#e317" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c317" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">317</a></h3>
<p>— Uncle Xun</p>
<p>The brilliant streetlights shoot straight into the clouds, patches of red glow reflecting in the deep gray floating clouds; the twilight only gradually thickens, followed by the night sounds sadly groaning in the sky, as if telling people, "The god of night has descended upon the world, and the drama of all evils is about to begin."</p>
<p>Indeed, this drama of evil is performed most intensely on North Sichuan Road, known as the Street of Mystery. When I and Ying Jun were pacing on the wide Sichuan Road Bridge, the clock of the General Post Office had already struck eight times, the cars, rickshaws, and carriages were emitting various rhythms, the red lights and streetlights were flashing in the crossroads in a variety of patterns, and the pedestrians were exceptionally crowded, walking back and forth.</p>
<p>On the sidewalks on both sides, in the crowds, stood countless young girls selling their souls, waiting, waiting, occasionally emitting a miserable guttural sound! Extending thin white hands, dragging and pulling at passersby.</p>
<p>Clearly: Judging from this situation, North Sichuan Road has completely transformed from decline to bustling. Here! There are no broken tiles from bombings. Here! There are no knife-stabbed cracks, but here! There are only tall Western-style buildings and luxurious cinemas and restaurants.</p>
<p>On the road; there is the sound of Japanese women's wooden clogs! There is also the drunken roaring of English sailors: and even the jazz sounds playing waltzes and Charleston tunes... humming: spreading from this Street of Mystery, composing the symphony of the night.</p>
<p>The wind blows, blowing all over this snake-like North Sichuan Road.</p>
<h3 id="e318">Suzhou at Night <a href="#e318" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c318" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">318</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Gui</p>
<p>Night in Suzhou is not as mysterious and lively as in Shanghai. Although when the curtain of night unfolds, in the center of the city—Guanqian Street—there are also red and green neon lights, emitting dazzling light, and in the Lei Dianhua, singing soul-stirring songs, snake-like women, in the streets and on the sidewalks, twisting out graceful postures; those white and slightly dark fleshy legs, even more greasily, under the long-slit cheongsams, emit a tempting flesh color. If it is in the summer.</p>
<p>But after nine o'clock, the stores on Guanqian Street gradually close, with only a few food stores and cigarette stores remaining sparsely, the lights are gradually dimmed, the pedestrians are gradually sparse, only the remaining shop assistants in the few open shops, and the policemen standing guard on the street, are still struggling to stay awake; the rickshaw pullers in the street are also dozing off while sitting on the parked rickshaws. - Although there are a few restaurants, from time to time flying out the sounds of drinking games.</p>
<p>After ten o'clock, the cinemas also end their shows, although there is still a Peking opera house, performing its best show with gongs and drums in full swing; however, except for a few dim sum shops nearby, still waiting for theatergoers after the show, the stores have all closed their doors. As for people, except for newspaper reporters, guards, and some workers, there are only a few wonton vendors and tea egg sellers, hissing in the cold wind. Even the rickshaw pullers lined up outside the theater are dozing off, waiting for the theater to close and do one last business - outside Jinmen Gate, it is indeed a bit more lively. Those young girls, maids, and other street ladies, like flower butterflies, shuttle in and out of the hotels, and the "Little Easterner...", "Slaves come to play the huqin..." Peking opera tunes and ditties, from time to time, along with the clear huqin sounds, spread from the hotel rooms or restaurants, making the road exceptionally lively, with policemen on duty, patrols checking the streets, pimps soliciting customers, street-wandering hooligans, fortunetellers on the sidewalks... As for the shops, except for teahouses, nine out of ten are still open, until the Peking opera ends in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>The singing girls in Minqing Lane, under the protection of the Minzu Society, have long since resumed the prostitute life of the "Changsan" type, with drinking parties and card games in the courtyard still in full swing until late at night. The chartered cars with electric lights are the only colorful objects on the road in Suzhou at night.</p>
<p>This is the "Night in Suzhou," the paradise on earth!</p>
<h3 id="e319">West Lake at Night <a href="#e319" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c319" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">319</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Yi</p>
<p>One day, perhaps it was exactly June 16th of the lunar calendar, I strolled to Pinghu Qiuyue, one of the famous scenic spots on Bai Causeway in West Lake, to cool off in the evening.</p>
<p>That dreadful sun had just been swallowed by the short, elegant peaks. The surrounding hazy green mountains, near and far, gradually lost their beautiful appearance; they seemed to be getting sick, changing from pale white to a terrible iron-green face. The clear green lake water also turned black.</p>
<p>Pairs of male and female tourists, young students, walked along Bai Causeway and the road, under the weeping willows and electric lights, talking, laughing, and playing. The small boats on the lake, carrying old men, old women, children, girls, students, and lovers, competed to row with great strides. On the lakeside road and Bai Causeway, the cars of wealthy people raced roaringly.</p>
<p>Music, opera singing, laughter, noise, dog barks, insect sounds, frog sounds, wind sounds, water sounds, children's crying, and the sounds of bells and drums from mountain temples all came from various places far and near, overwhelming the senses.</p>
<p>"Good! Beautiful!"</p>
<p>"Look! Isn't that a fireball!"</p>
<p>"It's as red as blood!"</p>
<p>"Look! How beautiful! Isn't that a fire dragon on the lake!"</p>
<p>Suddenly a burst of shouts. The children jumped and shouted excitedly.</p>
<p>The teary stars seemed to be preparing to welcome the moon.</p>
<p>At this time, feeling too noisy, I left Pinghu Qiuyue and walked along Bai Causeway towards the already very perfect Broken Bridge. The Baochu Pagoda, towering on Geling Hill, silently overlooked the calm lake. In the inner West Lake, the red, white, and pink lotuses, and the green silk umbrella-like lotus leaves, which competed for beauty during the day, now seemed to be lazily swaying in the breeze and sleeping silently because they could not show their beauty.</p>
<p>Looking back at the bright moon that was striving to rise, it seemed to smile at the tourists on the lake and say:</p>
<p>Don't be too lazy!</p>
<p>Don't be greedy for play!</p>
<p>Don't lose the great and precious time!</p>
<p>Come on!</p>
<p>Come! Follow me and keep moving forward without stopping!</p>
<h3 id="e320">Night's Seller of Smiles <a href="#e320" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c320" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">320</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Lou</p>
<p>Late at night, I tread forward on the silver streets of the city. The arc lights of the colorful stores give people a strong pink stimulation, and in the surrounding shadows stand chicken prostitutes selling their flesh piecemeal. I cannot bear to look at their bright red colors, and I quickly escape!</p>
<p>In my ears are the noisy singing sounds. The Eastern Hotel, lying like a corpse, is brightly lit by white-hot electric lights. On the curtains: the shadows of people and the light of cups are still intertwined, and bursts of laughter still pour out. This laughter seems to be the gnawing laughter of people with blood seeping from their teeth!</p>
<p>I am a little angry and begin to curse:</p>
<p>These, these who are active in piles of gold, these who are lost in gold-selling dens, these who endlessly taste the flavor of flesh in pink dreams... Ah! Who says it is not an extreme mockery of our decadent souls? Who says it is not an extreme persecution of those sellers of smiles who expose their flesh for the sake of life's squeezing?</p>
<p>I do not curse the wax-like singing girls under the strong lights. Perhaps they are not entirely seeking the gifts of gold. They are all memorable sellers of smiles of the night who have been destroyed by the whip of life, but their smiles, what have they ever been smiles? Their songs, what have they ever been songs? They are the trembling cries, weak, small, and withered! They cry out the sorrows of all weak souls and all those whose hearts have been insulted;</p>
<p>They—the sellers of smiles of the night—can never obtain a safe life, and never dare to give up blood-seeping greasepaint and tear-swallowing seductive smiles. They are always being persecuted in the shadows of the night, under the baking of the hot lights—until they die!</p>
<p>Thus, pitifully! These sellers of smiles of the night, who have no real understanding and resistance, are also always pitied under our pen tips!</p>
<p>"Ah! Sellers of smiles of the night!</p>
<p>You are the female convicts violated by brutal soldiers in the Siberian penal colony!</p>
<p>You are the female followers who are forced to expose their flesh in the marketplace in Jerusalem by the Jews!"</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Notes</p>
<h3 id="e321">Night University Hodgepodge <a href="#e321" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c321" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">321</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Yingdai</p>
<p>This is truly full of wonders. In the metropolis of Shanghai, in addition to ordinary universities, there are also night universities. As the name suggests, night universities naturally have classes in the evening. Because classes are held in the evening, life here is different from that of ordinary universities.</p>
<p>In an era when university tuition is so expensive, if your family has no property, don't even think about crossing the threshold. A son studying at a university must have his family send eight hundred to a thousand dollars a year. However, in night universities, everyone has a job during the day and feels that their knowledge is not enough, so they use their spare time at night to study at night universities. Therefore, there is obviously a manifestation of populism here, and there is no need for families to send money.</p>
<p>Classes start at 4:30, but the office must close at 5:00. This class really can't be chosen! Even if you choose a 5:30 class, running from the office to the school at 5:00 is not enough time if the road is far. At this time, most of the students are running in a hurry, even more urgently than soldiers going to the front line, afraid of missing the start of class, and when they arrive at school, they are already out of breath.</p>
<p>Working during the day and studying at night is already implementing a work-study model, providing for one's own tuition and integrating occupation and education, which is a proud thing. But after working seven or eight hours during the day and then studying for four or five hours at night, energy is limited. In the classroom, if the teacher can't lift the students' spirits, many people may fall asleep!</p>
<p>Although there are young men in suits and fashionable ladies studying knowledge in the same classroom, there is no competition for queen or the title of princess here. Female students and male students rarely talk to each other, except for a very few; therefore, if you encounter male and female students talking together, it will attract a lot of attention, so-called rare and strange!</p>
<p>If you choose three or four hours of classes continuously from 4:30 to 9:30, eating dinner becomes a problem. Listening to lectures on an empty stomach, with ears and hands working hard, while the stomach is singing its empty city strategy, this is a special flavor. By the time class is over, it is already ravenously hungry, and there is no time to go home to eat.</p>
<p>Although in this night university, there is a manifestation of a populist color, most of the students walk to and from school, but there are also a few cars picking up and dropping off students, but it is only a minority; therefore, when school is dismissed, they in their cars will attract the attention and envy of the general students.</p>
<p>When school is dismissed, male and female students go down the narrow escalator, walk out the door, and disperse to go home. Occasionally, a male student will follow a female student, intentionally or unintentionally, I don't care, but we rarely see them turn around. Here, the fact is clearly telling us that the female students in night university all express an attitude of "sacred and inviolable"!</p>

<h3 id="e322">On Building New Villages <a href="#e322" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c322" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">322</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Tao</p>
<p>In recent years, affected by social instability, people have wanted to escape reality. Those who advocate suicide think that once is enough, and those who convert to Buddhism always see everything as flowers in a mirror and the moon in the water. Even if it is not completely unconscious, the result of self-perfection not only does not remedy the instability but only indirectly helps it grow.</p>
<p>In this negative situation, it is gratifying that a group that strives to build new villages has emerged.</p>
<p>Since the May Fourth Movement, the organization of the old society has no longer been suitable for general needs. The literary and artistic circles hold their initial ideals and spare no effort in advocating the construction of new villages. Such ideals have also been frequently expressed in novels. In recent years, many intellectuals who have returned from overseas, have been to the villages of emerging countries, and have lived a fresh and lively life, once they return to this environment that has not easily changed for two thousand years, the dryness and noise drive them to embark on the road of reform; under hasty management, the plan for the new village is put into practice.</p>
<p>However, following this practice, it is still a piece of dryness and noise. They failed.</p>
<p>The reasons for the failure, in addition to the fact that China's politics are not on track, always giving social reformers great pain, the second reason is the imperfection of the internal organization.</p>
<p>Later comers have no reason to repeat this mistake.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that what can be built in the hearts of the masses is a sound cause. And today's Chinese masses are the toiling poor. The first step that urgently needs to be transformed is the life of the small rooms, attics, thatched sheds, and huts. Building new villages should start with this class. As for the petty bourgeoisie who own tens of thousands of dollars in cash, although they can build a few new Western-style houses and form a new village, how long will it be before everything has to decline with their souls?</p>
<p>Moreover, the plan for the new village is not an escape, and there can be no slightest illusion of Utopia. The life of the residents of the new village should not be a life of leisure and enjoyment, but a life of more actively fighting with life in the same goal and under the same pace.</p>
<p>All slogans of comfort and beauty are superfluous here.</p>
<p>Saneatsu Mushanokōji said it well: "The purpose of the new village is to manage people's lives, walk the right path of people, solve the worries of clothing, food, and shelter, promote the glory of people, and establish faith in people." (Only from what I can remember). The "people" referred to here have a correct and new meaning.</p>
<p>Therefore, the responsibility of the new village is to ensure that there is no inhuman life, inhuman behavior, and inhuman thought in this world; the responsibility of the new village is to advance, not to retreat.</p>
<h3 id="e323">After "Recollections of the Past" (Part 1) <a href="#e323" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c323" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">323</a></h3>
<p>— Feng Zhiyu</p>
<p>I wasn't careful and indulged in a bit of reminiscing, which drew out an article from Mr. Shi Zhecun, "Zhuangzi and Selections of Refined Literature," who thought that my words were aimed at him, yet hoped they weren't.</p>
<p>I would like to make a few clarifications: that "Recollections of the Past" was not written for Mr. Shi, but it could include him.</p>
<p>If I were targeting someone specifically, according to modern writing conventions, I should have investigated the opponent's place of origin, background, appearance, and even what products their hometown produces and what kind of shop their father owned, and subtly insult them a few times to be considered proper. But my piece contained none of these things. What I was referring to was the general atmosphere of a large group of remnants of the past; I wasn't singling out anyone in particular. But because I was referring to a group, it was inevitable that many would feel touched, even if not entirely, at least a part of them, even if they don't always belong to that group, they sometimes do. Now, Mr. Shi himself said that he advised young people to read "Zhuangzi and Selections of Refined Literature" "to help with literary cultivation," which naturally has some relevance to what I was criticizing. But to think that this article was written for him is truly "nervous oversensitivity." I really didn't mean that.</p>
<p>However, that was before Mr. Shi explained his views. Now, even that "relevance" feels a bit distant because what I was criticizing was a more stubborn group of remnants of the past with even higher standards.</p>
<p>Now, after reading Mr. Shi's own explanation: (1) I realized that his situation at the time was because the manuscript paper was too small, and "if it had been a bit wider," he "wanted to write several more books in it." (2) I realized that his previous experience was "switching from a Chinese teacher to editing a magazine," and he felt that "young people's writing was too clumsy and straightforward, and their vocabulary was too limited," so he recommended these two ancient books to have them learn grammar and find vocabulary, "even though many of the words in them are dead." I think if Zhuangzi were alive today, after having his coffin split open, he would probably advise all women who aspire to marriage to read "Biographies of Exemplary Women."</p>
<p>Here's another point:</p>
<p>(1) Mr. Shi said that I used bottles and wine to compare to "literary cultivation," which is incorrect. I never made such a comparison. I said that some new youths can have old ideas, and some old forms can contain new content. I also believe that there cannot be a clear division between "new literature" and "old literature," but there is transformation and a comparative bias. And precisely because there can be no "definitive division," there is no "third type of person's" standpoint.</p>
<p>(2) Mr. Shi said that writing rare characters and the like is a personal matter, as long as you don't force others to do the same. This seems very reasonable. However, middle school students and contributors, it is their own writing which is too clumsy and straightforward, and their vocabulary which is too small. They haven't forced others to write articles with limited vocabulary and clumsy grammar. Why did Mr. Shi feel so deeply and therefore advise "young people aspiring to literature" to read "Zhuangzi and Selections of Refined Literature"? When he was an examiner, selecting scholars based on wording, Mr. Shi didn't agree with that, but as a teacher and editor, he advised young people to read "Zhuangzi and Selections of Refined Literature." I really don't understand what the distinction is between these situations.</p>
<p>(3) Mr. Shi even brought up "Mr. Lu Xun," as if he inherited the new orthodox tradition of "Zhuangzi" and all of his articles were written after reading "Zhuangzi and Selections of Refined Literature." "I think this is also a bit arbitrary." In his articles, there are indeed many words that are found in "Zhuangzi and Selections of Refined Literature," such as "zhi, hu, zhe, ye," but these words are probably also found in other books. To put it bluntly, looking for living vocabulary from such books is simply foolish. I'm afraid Mr. Shi himself might not even do that.</p>
<h3 id="e324">Brief Notes on Autumnal Shade: On Buying Books <a href="#e324" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c324" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">324</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Dafu</p>
<p>Two or three years ago, Holbrook Jackson in England published a major work, Anatomy of Biblionlania. This "Anatomy of a Book Maniac" is rich in content and comprehensive in its citations. It can truly be compared to Robert Burton's Anatomy of Melancholy. The psychology of book maniacs, both ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign, seems to be the same. China has research on Song edition butterfly bindings, Ming printed cotton paper, etc. Foreign collectors are also willing to spend tens of thousands of gold yuan to buy a first edition of a collection of poems or essays. For example, the collection of poems by the Brontë sisters, published by Aylott and Jones, a thin volume Poems by Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell can sell for eight or nine hundred pounds or more. The reason is that one day Charlotte suddenly discovered Emily's poetry manuscript, and the three sisters discussed publishing a collection of poems at their own expense. Fortunately, Aylott &amp; Jones, a publisher in London, agreed to print and publish it for them for thirty pounds. But after a year, only two copies of this collection of poems were sold. The three sisters, after sending a few copies to friends, decided to sell the rest of the poems to a paper shop to be used as lining. But later, they transferred it to Smith, Elder &amp; Co. under better conditions for publication, so the collection of poems printed by Aylott &amp; Jones can sell for such a high price.</p>
<p>This kind of increase in the market value of rare books also became popular in China after Hu Shi wrote several textual researches on novels. Now, even elementary textbooks such as the Three Character Classic, Hundred Family Surnames, and Dragon Text Shadow, printed on yellow paper in this version, sell for several dollars a copy. So-called Sinology has become the exclusive knowledge of the rich. The poor are left to learn the ABCs to seek shortcuts. Thus, the cunning old booksellers who hoard books get their way, and everyone is getting rich.</p>
<p>A few months ago, Mr. Shi Zhecun wrote an article about buying Western old books in Shanghai, but based on my own experience, the prices of Western old books in Shanghai are also not cheap. Whenever I see a beloved old book and can't negotiate a price, I really have the urge to invite Hitler or Qin Shi Huang to implement dictatorship. But when I walk to the street and think calmly, there are still tens of millions of Chinese compatriots starving and freezing, waiting to die. Then I feel that our buying books is the same kind of vice as the capitalists' wild revelry.</p>
<h3 id="e325">Chen Jiongming and the Zhi Gong Tang <a href="#e325" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c325" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">325</a></h3>
<p>— He Ru</p>
<p>It was reported in the newspaper a month ago that Chen Jiongming's spirit hall had a Zhi Gong Tang party flag covering his coffin, indicating that he was the leader of the Zhi Gong Tang. The flag has the shape of a "bing" character, symbolizing the well-field system to indicate the meaning of equalizing land rights, and that those who till the land should own it. What is the Zhi Gong Tang or Zhi Gong Party? Not many people know. Here, according to the Tongmenghui's organ magazine, Min Bao, I will briefly describe it.</p>
<p>The gist of the Zhi Yi Tang's revised charter states: "The establishment of the Zhi Gong Tang has a long history. Based on the heart of loving the country and protecting the race, we establish the ambition of reviving the Han and avenging wrongs. We form alliances and gather together, responding to each other's calls. Nationalistic thought relies on it to flourish, and secret societies grow day by day because of it. It has long been spread throughout the eighteen provinces and the countries of the five continents. Wherever Chinese people go, there is one, especially in America. Residing in a region of equality and freedom, and in a nation of benevolent governance, forming alliances and unions are all unrestricted. Therefore, the development of the Hongmen is only natural." It can be seen that the Zhi Gong Tang was originally a secret society of the Hongmen, with national revolutionary ideas, originating in China and developing in the United States. It is said that at that time, the number of overseas Chinese students in the United States who were members of the Zhi Gong Tang was in the tens of thousands, which gives an idea of its prosperity. Its revised charter also states: "Now, fortunately, we have met the patriotic person, Mr. Sun Yat-sen, who has come to travel to the Americas. This Tang invited Huang Sande and other elders to travel to various ports, speaking on the tenets of the Hongmen and expounding on current Chinese affairs. Comrades in various ports began to awaken as if from a great dream, and realized that our party has a responsibility for the future of China. Mr. Sun further revised the charter, providing guidance, so that our overseas Chinese compatriots can rise up with the times." This can be used to examine the initial combination of the Nationalist Party and the Zhi Gong Tang, and Sun Yat-sen was the initiator of the Tang's reform. Writers of revolutionary history should not be unaware of this. Its revised charter outlines the following:</p>
<p>This Tang takes expelling the Manchus, restoring China, establishing the Republic, and equalizing land rights as its tenets.</p>
<p>This Tang takes cooperating to assist comrades in the motherland in implementing the tenets as its goal. All new members must abide by the teachings of Hongmen incense master Chen Jinnan, and observe the rites of entry.</p>
<p>Looking at its outline, it already has the scale of a revolutionary party, and Mr. Sun Yat-sen "revised the charter, providing guidance," and actually led it. After Chen Jiongming died, his relatives held a funeral for him, but used the Zhi Gong Tang flag, indicating a different direction from the Nationalist Party. Who knew that the Zhi Gong Tang's ability to become a modern political party actually relied on the guidance of the pioneers of the Nationalist Party?</p>
<h3 id="e326">Autumn Day <a href="#e326" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c326" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">326</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Yi</p>
<p>In the deep autumn, in the early morning, in the silent world, there is the sound of leaves falling, the sunlight lingers only on the roof, the alley is still dark. This ancient city has not yet woken up, the shadow, four or five times larger than the main body, are intricately arranged on the ground, like the city's veins, but also dim. The autumn wind shakes people's bodies and also shakes people's hearts. The lake water seems to be still, bearing a heavy mood. Crows are flying, circling, their black feathers, without any luster, rustily thickening the disgust for them, but they seem to be intelligently, having witnessed all these years of rise and fall, calling out with a disappointed voice, calling out so.</p>
<p>But there are countless people living in this city, living; there are good fantasies and hopes. Looking at it from this side, this city should have no day of death, because everyone hides their talents in their hearts, and when they meet they only say: "What a refreshing autumn!"</p>
<p>Is autumn so refreshing? On the golden roof tiles, there are thin grasses gradually turning golden, when the wind comes, the copper bell at the corner rings lonely. In this ringing sound, it seems that many things are about to be confessed; but they are not understood by people, nor are they known by people, only when a team of camels walks past, the string of bells under their necks rings out an answer that is not understood by people. And then, following these camels on their long journey, crossing mountains, crossing water, walking to the endless desert.</p>
<p>The desolate bugle is blowing.</p>
<p>The autumn sky is high and blue, and even though the gorgeous red leaves are trying their best to decorate it, they cannot help people think that the good days are gone, just like an old man in his twilight years thinking about death, he can only recall the past with endless sighs. But isn't the past all distant? Fantasizing about the silk tree, I see leaves like bird feathers, fluttering and falling on the road.</p>
<p>The frost of the previous night can gradually become bright beads.</p>
<p>The street is still quiet, the hunched-over street cleaner, wearing red clothes, sweeps the fallen leaves on the road, moving forward with slow steps. A policeman's yawn is heard far away. The morning bell of the temple is floating leisurely in the air. A lonely middle-aged man wakes up at this time.</p>
<p>Lately, the time he wakes up is earlier and earlier every day; and in the evening, there is always greater fatigue pressing on him. Every day he is thinking! "This should have a long and good sleep"; but he often wakes up very early, and is anxious, wanting to catch back what has slipped away from him, but it only becomes impossible.

<p>Bank of America Reduced Exchange Rates, Commodity Prices Plummeted, Market Opened Higher, One Yuan Exchange Speculation, Foreign Compensation, American Dollar Significantly Reduced, Final Result One Yuan Rises to Nine Yuan Sixty Cents</p>
<p>After the gold market broke through the 800 yuan mark, it seemed difficult to recover. Unexpectedly, yesterday the market rebounded again, rising significantly. Coinciding with the settlement, the final result was very firm. In the early morning, overseas silver markets in England and America both fell. The silver price on the Five Metals Exchange was reduced by four to five and a half cents.

Then, due to the appearance of the Bank of China's November US dollar at 29.4375 yuan, it retreated to within 20 yuan. After the opening, due to the bank's continuous buying, the exchange market hardened, and the situation fluctuated and declined. However, because of the prior knowledge that the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank's listing was flat for British currency and the American dollar suddenly reduced by one yuan, people's confidence was boosted and it rebounded again. Finally, due to the continued efforts of fellow traders, the bank's buying slowed, the domestic market tightened, and the short covering momentum was strong. It then broke through the 20 yuan mark again. The afternoon closing was the most popular. The increase during the half-day was not small. Reuters reported that stock prices were under pressure because American speculation was shorting, due to the government's apparent abandonment of inflation, exchange rates and commodity prices rose and fell, and American citizens opposed the recovery measures.

<h3 id="e330">Trade Declining and Long-Term Loans Have Few Transactions - Due to Many Reasons... Let's See After the 20th - <a href="#e330" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c330" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">330</a></h3>
<p>All trades are declining, and cash is concentrated, resulting in the good long-term transaction, at this launching time, turning to silence, which is lamentable. The reporter inquired about the current long-term due date, which is approaching, and there must be some access. So he turned to key figures in the money industry to inquire about the situation. According to the answer, there are several reasons why it cannot be prosperous: (1) Since the January 28th Incident in Shanghai, the vitality of various industries has declined and is difficult to recover, resulting in cash not being circulated after it is concentrated. (2) This year, most industries have more losses than profits, and the number of profitable industries is like a phoenix feather and unicorn horn. For the sake of cautious lending, they dare to be as lenient as possible. (3) The long-term loans due at the end of April, because the goods have not recovered, are cleared by owing this and owing that, and accumulated and pledged in turn, and there is no time to clear them. Therefore, the current term all want to urge collection, but how the market is like this, whether it can be repaid as desired is still unknown. (4) Ningbo's long-term loans, which were no less than tens of millions in previous years, after the recovery of some at the end of April, are now less than tens of millions, and there are many bad debts. It is feared that most of the current term will be transferred and only interest will be paid. It is difficult to seek recovery. As for new transactions, it is not possible to talk about them at the present time. We must wait until after the 20th to determine the action. Although the money houses currently have a lot of deposits, most of the excellent transactions have been seized by Chinese commercial banks, and they will not be able to do the more superior accounts. From the above observations, the situation of long-term access in the current term is feared to be far inferior to the situation at the end of April.</p>

<p>Yesterday, due to it being Saturday, the Chinese Securities Exchange experienced unusually quiet trading, and the market was abnormally sluggish with no significant trend to speak of. Market sentiment was lax, with neither large investors nor small investors showing much enthusiasm. Most were taking a wait-and-see approach, perhaps expecting a period of stability.

<p>A report from Sin Fung Hong stated that the New York stock market on the 13th fell due to weak grain prices, but the pressure was not strong, suggesting a cautious approach for the time being. The total daily trading volume was 1,270,000 shares. The "wheat" market declined due to weakness in Liverpool and the closing of long positions with limit loss orders, as well as the market's ability to stabilize. However, buyers remained confident, and the market favored bulls, making short positions feel particularly risky. "Cotton" prices fell due to government debt replacements, leading some to feel disappointed about inflation, resulting in spot sales, coupled with lackluster performance in other southern markets and continued hedging from the South. New purchasing enthusiasm is needed, but it must await the development of farmers' loans. The "silver" market was weak due to the strength of the US dollar. The US Treasury Department's gold price was 30.62 yuan per ounce. The Dow Jones Index is listed below:</p>

<p>The yarn market is calm, with a dim outlook and nothing exciting to report. The bulls are not releasing the amount they have absorbed, and the desire to take delivery remains strong. As a result, sellers are hesitant to act rashly, leading to market stagnation.</p>

<p>The cotton market opened with a flat atmosphere, but the decline in American cotton prices improved sentiment. Because the amount of tight bull positions was not released, prices for each month rose or fell by one to three jiao. In the afternoon, trading in spot yarn was not high, and prices for each month were flat, with no significant fluctuations. Total trading volume for the day was 19,200 bales.

<p>The cotton market softened due to the decline in American cotton prices, further weakening sentiment. However, the sharp decline in exchange rates and the rise in gold prices meant that calculations did not change much, so speculators remained inactive, resulting in slightly lower trading volumes. However, the transaction volume for this month was still large. Although there were some deliveries, the moisture content was too high, so buyers maintained a strong grip. Future prospects remain uncertain.</p>

<h3 id="e342">Grain, Scarce Arrival of River-Bottom Rice Continues to Support Prices <a href="#e342" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c342" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">342</a></h3>
<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday's supply came from more than 30 sources, with wholesale and retail volume similar to yesterday. Due to the continued scarcity of supply, there was a sense of selling as soon as it arrived. This continued to make the market robust. Near noon, the market seemed to turn dull. Each merchant continued to offer higher prices for broken japonica rice, with new japonica and new pointed rice also showing advantages. Only rice from the kiln was slightly adjusted due to changing merchant sentiment, but the price of Yin Yuan remained strong.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday's supply from various routes downriver was 15 or 16 sources. Sales in the market were sluggish due to the decreasing supply of old goods and the unenthusiastic reception of new goods. Therefore, the market price of white broken japonica, western new japonica, new kiln-type rice, white yuan, and new Du pointed rice increased slightly. New Bu Yang Ke pointed rice increased significantly. The price of new Yin Yuan increased slightly by a few fen.</p>
<h3 id="e343">Revival of Hokkien Merchants' Interest in Purchasing Ke Xian Rice - High Prices Rise Step by Step... Middle and Secondary Prices Follow Suit - <a href="#e343" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c343" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">343</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's Ke Xian rice market saw no interest from local merchants, but the Hokkien merchants were actively purchasing. The Quanzhou merchants continued to load, and the Shantou and Ning Shao merchants revived and actively purchased. The Fujian provincial capital merchants, who had stopped purchasing the previous day, resumed active purchasing due to previous purchases being paid for and strong demand in the area, showing great appetite. Although there were some arrivals recently, high-quality goods were extremely scarce. As the Quanzhou, Shantou, Fuzhou, and Ning Shao merchants uniformly picked and chose high-quality goods, the market price for high-quality goods rose step by step. Yesterday, prices increased by almost a jiao. With high prices rising, middle and secondary prices also followed suit. If the various Hokkien merchants continue to inquire, the market may continue to rise. Yesterday, merchants in Fuzhou purchased over 2,000 bags of Jiangxi Ji Wan rice and Hunan Ji Xi rice, Jing rice, and brown rice. Shantou merchants purchased 200 bags of Nanjing Xian rice, and Ning Shao merchants purchased over 300 bags of Jiangxi early and late rice. There seemed to be a continued trend of purchasing.</p>
<h3 id="e344">Flour and Wheat Reach an Unprecedented Low Price - Creating a New Era in Oversupply - <a href="#e344" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c344" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">344</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market saw another dismal drop of seven jiao for all months. Canadian wheat fell by around eight jiao. Even with the gradual decline, the situation abroad continued to worsen, and actual sales could not be stimulated. Even in the exchange, although factories gradually withdrew their standards after the margin requirement for short positions was increased to 500 yuan, there was still no real remedy. This type of maintenance remained passive because the force of global prices could not be resisted by one corner alone. Therefore, after the opening price, the market immediately began to fall sharply. At the opening in the afternoon, the situation became even more tragic. The current month even broke through the 1 jiao mark, reaching a low of 2 yuan 8 fen 7 li 5 hao. This type of market not only represents an unprecedented low price but also marks another page in the history of oversupply. Distant months also saw news of fixed prices for foreign wheat, and prices gradually eased. In the end, this month fell by 2 fen 7 li 5 hao compared to the previous day, November fell by 2 fen 5 hao, December and January each fell by 2 fen 7 li 5 hao, February fell by 3 fen, and March fell by 2 fen 2 li 5 hao.</p>
<h3 id="e345">Wheat <a href="#e345" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c345" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">345</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat futures market, the prices of various months showed another sign of a sharp fall. With foreign wheat quoted at a big drop of 1 yuan and 7 jiao in Chicago and around 7 to 8 jiao in Canada, and global prices not improving, coupled with the backlog of flour sales domestically, the future of the wheat market was less hopeful. Therefore, after the opening price, the market sentiment for each month was greatly loosened. The current month fell to 7 jiao and 5 fen, and November fell to 8 jiao and 3 fen, falling by 6 to 7 fen compared to the previous day's closing price. By the afternoon opening, prices recovered slightly due to some short covering, and new short positions also stopped. However, there was a definite transaction of 4,500 tons of Canadian No. 3 wheat at a price of 4 yuan 3 jiao and 8 fen. Therefore, it is not difficult to infer the future situation from this. As a result, the current month fell by 4 fen, November fell by 3 fen, December fell by 2 fen, January fell by 1 fen, and March fell by 3 fen. Due to factories having no interest and the fall in standard flour and wheat, there was no open trading in spot wheat.</p>
<h3 id="e346">Yong Merchants' Strong Demand for Sesame Seeds - Local Merchants Also Showed Digestion - <a href="#e346" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c346" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">346</a></h3>
<p>The sesame seed market has been weak for a long time due to the lack of large-scale digestion. There has been a small but steady supply of sesame seed. Currently, it is reported that there is approximately 11,000 to 12,000 bags of rough sesame seeds in stock (excluding the foreign-managed pure white sesame). With the arrival and stock levels not being high, market sentiment has stabilized slightly. Furthermore, the Yong merchants have shown strong demand recently, and local merchants have also shown interest, so the market is doing well. Yesterday, the Yong merchants purchased 110 bags of white sesame seeds to be delivered to Zhen, with a price of 6 yuan and 9 jiao. 200 bags of Nanjing white sesame seeds were priced at 7 yuan and 4 jiao and 7 yuan respectively. 63 bags of Hankou black sesame seeds and over 70 bags of Jiujiang black sesame seeds were also purchased. Local merchants purchased 85 bags of Tushan white sesame seeds, with a price of 6 yuan 3 jiao and 5 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e347">Sugar Market - Small Decrease of 5 Fen for Zhonghua Refined White Sugar <a href="#e347" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c347" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">347</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market showed a weakening trend due to a slight decrease in customs duties and a slight increase in the Dutch exchange rate. The association's official quotation for No. 24 raw sugar white common grade was 21 yuan 6 jiao and 2 fen. There were no transactions at the original quotation. No. 20 medium sugar white was quoted at 20 yuan 8 jiao and 5 fen, Dutch Red No. 89 was quoted at 16 yuan 7 jiao and 5 fen, Taikoo Sugar B mark was quoted at 21 yuan 6 jiao and 5 fen, HX mark was quoted at 20 yuan 8 jiao and 5 fen, with a few transactions. Zhonghua Guohua refined white top grade was 20 yuan 7 jiao, No. 1 was 5 jiao, No. 2 was 3 jiao, No. 3 was 1 jiao, No. 4 was 19 yuan 9 jiao, a small decrease of 5 fen compared to the previous day. More than 200 bags of Chaoqing sugar were offered, with the highest price being 15 yuan 7 jiao and 5 fen, followed by 15 yuan 1 jiao, and then 14 yuan 8 jiao and 5 fen to 6 jiao and 5 fen. There were sporadic transactions in Jian ice sugar, with no change in price.</p>
<h3 id="e348">Silk and Tea - Overseas Silk Sales Show Increasing Weakness <a href="#e348" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c348" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">348</a></h3>
<p>(Shipping of Eight-Cocoon Eri Silk to the United States is Obstructed) The eight-cocoon eri silk (i.e., wild silk) produced in Shandong and the three northeastern provinces of China is a unique natural product, and its sales have historically relied on the United States as its main destination. Monthly exports amounted to several hundred bales. In recent years, the wild silk produced in Korea has flourished, greatly impacting the sales of eri silk to the United States. Coupled with the spread of labor strikes in the United States, the consumption of raw silk has drastically decreased, and the shipping of eri cocoons to the United States has become increasingly difficult. In the most recent month (September 10th to October 10th), only 155 bales of eight-cocoon eri silk were shipped to New York, San Francisco, Seattle, and other ports.</p>
<p>(Scarce Shipments of Jiaxing Green Silk to Shanghai) Jiaxing green silk is a unique product of China, historically sold to Europe and the United States. However, the production volume is not high, with only a few hundred bales exported annually. This year's cocoon production was not abundant, and shipments of green silk to Shanghai were scarce. In the most recent half-month, only 35 pieces were shipped.</p>
<p>(Increasingly Quiet Sales of Artificial Silk to Customers) The price of artificial silk in this port is trending upwards due to the tight exchange rate, and sales to customers are increasingly quiet. Only the Shanghai silk factories imported 22 cases of Feima, Jinyu, and Liuhai brands, with prices ranging from 178 yuan 9 jiao and 5 fen to 163 yuan 5 jiao net.</p>
<p>(Unusually Low Prices for European and American Telegraphic Transfer Silk) The foreign-managed silk market in this port has been in a state of decline. Overseas silk sales have been decreasing due to oversupply, and silk prices have been gradually decreasing. The telegraphic transfer price of white filature silk in New York is only 612 yuan, and in Lyon, it is only over 700 yuan (both B grade). The cost of each factory is between 760 to 770 yuan to 850 to 860 yuan, a difference of 150 to 160 yuan. The factories are incurring huge losses and cannot afford to dump their goods. The market is quiet. Yesterday, only Yin Zhuang and others imported 8 bales of yellow filature silk and 11 bales of yellow coarse silk, with prices remaining generally weak.</p>
<h3 id="e349">Slight Movement in English Sales of Keemun Black Tea <a href="#e349" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c349" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">349</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the foreign-managed tea market of this port, English firms such as Jardine Matheson and Tongfu resumed purchasing high and medium-grade Keemun black tea due to receiving inquiries from England, and a total of 191 cases were traded for a price of 87 to 90 yuan. Trading in various green teas was scarce. Most of the high-grade Zhenmei teas from Tunxi and Shexian have already been sold out, and only residual goods remain on the market. Chinese merchants are maintaining a firm stance on price increases, and the trend in the tea market is stable.</p>
