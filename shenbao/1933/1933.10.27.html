<p>— 偉</p>
<p>自前年九一八東北禍變爆發以來。日本遂有若脱覊之怒馬。日以瘋狂之姿態。向急峻狹隘之險道上疾駛狂奔。此一急峻狹隘之險道爲何。自其内政言之。爲軍閥獨裁政治之加速推進。自其外交言之。則爲帝國主義政策之澈底實施。故即日本有識人士。亦引以爲憂。</p>
<p>在獨裁政治推進之過程中。其要求爲内政與外交之統一。質言之。即置内政外交一切於軍部統制之下。近年以來。日本之議會政治。爲軍部勢力所排擊。呈現一種崩潰没落之情勢。已無可諱。而所謂霞關外交之徒。力爲軍部外交之應聲。一舉一動。無不仰承少壯派之鼻息。則尤爲無可否認之事實。職是之故。即由軍部一手選拔所謂「焦土外交」之内田。尚以不能奉迎如意而告退。則廣田之所以能戀起膺外相之職者。其唯一之使命。非將欲努力於軍部要求所謂「一元國策」之確立。以盡其責任乎。</p>
<p>廣田出身於著名右傾團體之玄洋社。號稱爲外交界稀有之硬漢。且又爲著名之中國通。更因其原藉爲福岡。與軍部少壯派因鄉誼而益爲接近。其能得軍部之提掖。爲霞關之主。蓋亦自有其淵源。故當其就任之初。力言外交與國防關係極爲密切。且以此爲躍進外交之口號。即無異於承認今後之霞關。聽從軍部之指揮。而最近恊定國策之五相會議。亦以軍部之策動而召集。其所恊定之國策。雖末由悉其詳細。但消息之透露者。一則曰「今後日本國策之基礎。須綜合外交國防産業各政策而組成一元式之國策。」再則曰「尤以值此非常時局。國防至關重大。固不待言。而外交當認爲與國防平行。乃由外交之充分實行。力進而謀國防之平時戰略化。」三則曰「國防與外交。須視爲一車之兩輪。而同一目標。分途並進。故外務省與陸海兩省須切實合作。一是則更可由此而推知所謂廣田外交。實以武裝爲其後盾。以軍備爲其實質。以貫澈大陸政策爲其目的。</p>
<p>在十月二十一日　時閣議中。廣田曾說明其外交方針表示對美對蘇對英法德諸國以及我國。都有確定之原則目前且巳實行刷新外交。自更調駐外各使着手。吾人行且目覩此高踞問題　之新騎士在日本少壯派軍人指揮之下。將大展其手腕矣。</p>
<p>總之日本今已向急峻狹隘之險道。開步猛進。其前途之爲福爲禍。吾人在此固不必預爲推斷。獨是在此種情勢之下。我國來日大難。廣田曾有言曰。「日本之新外交方針。乃爲應付一九三五年之外交危機。並極力維持遠東乃至世界之和平。」嗚呼。和平歟。戰爭歟。固不待智者而後辨。我國究應如何凖備以應付之也。</p>

<h3 id="c246">傳說是進步的仇敵 <a href="#c246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— 佩萸</p>
<p>美國最偉大最美麗的尼加拉Ｎiagara瀑布附近，有一家電力廠，廠中某一間發電機房裏的牆壁上，掛着一張惹人注意，並能使人感動的告白。這告白上面寫道：「傳說是進步的仇敵」。</p>
<p>假使我是個青年，我一定要把這張告白上的字句，抄錄下來，掛在我自己的書室中，做座右銘。爲什麽呢？因爲這一句話，雖則是寥寥幾個字，郤回答了現在許多有志青年腦中常想，口頭常說的一個問題。你丨丨或是你的兒子，或是你的兄弟，或是你的姪兒丨丨不是時常這樣的說嗎：「不知怎樣的機會，能使我在社會上，世界上做成一種轟轟烈烈的大事業來？這是甚麽機會」？</p>
<p>卽使有種聲音，竟超過了那所大電力廠宛如雷鳴的響聲，那告白上的八個字，總是明明白白地担保說，種種機會正在等候你。因爲寥寥的八個字中，含有　種絕對的保證說：機會從來没有像現在時候在青年的門外叩得更加響了。</p>
<p>你或者要說：「這句話聽聽確是很有道理。不知你能否提出些事實來證」</p>
<p>明一下」？</p>
<p>是啊；我想我是能夠的。</p>
<p>第一，我國工商業的樞機，現在操於一般青年領袖的手掌中。我們差不多天天可以從報紙上雜誌上，看見青年們做了銀行行長，公司經理，工廠技師等等。换句話說，青年已變爲推進輸了。在我說青年二字的時候，並不限於做領袖的人是在二十歳，或三十歳，或是别種顯有界限的年齡。我用這兩個字是廣義的。</p>
<p>我的意思是說，他們有新穎的思想，遠大的目光，充實的技能，廣博的學識，堅忍的毅力，奮進的勇氣，勤勞的精神，健全的體格，愉快的心境，不屈不撓，勞心勞力地去發掘眼前的寳藏。那是「青年」兩字的眞意義。青年這種不間斷有熱望的志願，這種勇往直前的毅力，確是發展我國現在工商業的支配力，也就是一切事業進步的强大後盾。假使你不信「傳說是進步的仇敵」的這句話，一味的墨守成規，或迷信命運，或狐疑不决，或畏縮不前，那麽你永無成功的一日了，大大的辜負了你門的機會了。</p>
<h3 id="c247">名和利 <a href="#c247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— 棲鳳樓主</p>
<p>前清乾隆年間，年豐物阜，四海昇平；所以高宗（乾隆）很寫意的，出宫南巡，遨遊江南名勝，一日，偕一高僧，到海濱去眺望，但見海中帆檣往來如織，高宗問僧道：海中共有多少船隻？僧回奏：計有兩隻、高宗訝道：何以見得？乃奏答曰：一隻爲「名」，一隻爲「利」，而已。按現在海中的船，恐在不久的將來，將減爲一隻了，因爲人們都在逐逐趨利，問名的尚有幾人！</p>
<p>有人說：「名」是虚的，「利」是實的，其實這話似是而非，要知「名」和「利」，是有連帶關係的，而且以名求利，方爲正道，詐欺取巧的攫利，非但不正當，並且祗能圖得暫時的利益，决難久長，可是現在的人們，僅知追逐於目前，誰又顧到日後的失敗。</p>
<p>至於名利雙收，孰不希冀，但於未成名前，刦不能有利的思想存乎其間，總宜兢兢業業的，惟向成名的正道奔進！以達到知人之所不知，能人之所不能，艱苦危難，都所不計，如是，我知必有成名之一朝，待已獲得令名，當然各方會前來踵求，到那時候，更不煩你再另費心機，自然而然的會利至名歸了。</p>

<p>— 相</p>
<p>（一）採棉花</p>
<p>一個一個背着竹的籃簏，老的，少的，男的，女的，或是戴着笠帽，或是青布裹着頭……</p>
<p>朝晨，自村五裏跑出來，單獨的跑，成羣的跑……</p>
<p>向東，向西，南，北向他們所有的棉地裏跑。</p>
<p>白的，軟的，一朶朶的棉花，柔軟而潔白的棉花，他們都俯着頭，細心地授着，放這背上的籃簏採裏去，一朶朶的軟而白的棉花，巳經熱透了，落在沙上上，他們也俯着頭，輕輕地拾起來，也照樣放到這背後的簏子裏去。</p>
<p>從朝晨到夜晚，從今天到明天，到棉花拾盡爲止，祗看見他們把空的簏子背出去，裝滿了棉花背回來。</p>
<p>身體上雖則非常的苦痛，但精神上也許非常的欣慰，他們的心，眞和棉花一樣的潔白。</p>
<p>（二）割稻</p>
<p>夕陽把田野染成金黄色，將絕的秋蟬，還是「知了，知了，」的呌出，呌得非常的哀憐。</p>
<p>一個年邁的農人，很喜悦地擔着成熟的稻，從他們的田裏，擔到家中的塲上，表示出他最後的勝利。</p>
<p>幾個年青的農人，持着鐮刀，不住的割他們的稻，一刻也不休息。</p>
<p>割着，擔着，把金黄色的田野，漸漸地變成赭黑的泥土。</p>
<p>從播種，蒔秧，戽水，……安安逸逸的而得今日的收穫，今年望明年，明年望後年，……祗要没有天災，人禍，……他們的辛苦也不算白費了。</p>
<p>（三）打稻</p>
<p>「拍搭，……拍搭，」</p>
<p>一對年青的男女，嘴裏唱着鄉間的情歌，手中把稻相互地在稻牀上打，發出這麽的聲音，好似爲他倆拍拍子。</p>
<p>「索落，……索落，」這是穀落下來的聲音。</p>
<p>歌聲，打稻聲，穀落聲，一個美妙的三重奏，在這大自然裏演奏着。</p>
<p>歌，連續地唱着，稻，連續地打着，……他倆也不覺得辛勞，乏力，他倆巳經沉醉了。</p>
<p>公雞，母雞，三五成羣，不顧主人的一年期望和勞苦，偷偷地吃到四面的穀，它們的主人，也不曾覺察，也許不願意去驚擾它們。</p>

<p>開篇現在又風行一時了，報紙上，無綫電播音中，常常可以看得到的。但是合乎開篇腔調的，郤是很少很少，開篇是蘇州文藝中一種特殊作品，異省異縣人不會作，做出來總有些拗腔别調。詩壇作手也不會作，做出來偏於詞采化。不諳平仄者不會作，做出來近乎灘簧化。有此三不會作，所以好詩常常可見，好開篇郤是絕無而僅有。近在某書場中，聽得一摩登開篇，頗爲發噱，而且平仄諧，腔調合，文字在不雅不俗之間，確是出色當行的好開篇，據聞係某君所撰，某君是開篇中的名手，當然有此應經合節的作品了，惜乎吾的記憶力弱，只記得開端一部分。寫在下面：金風玉露正交秋，蟲語悽凉呌不休。不獨秋蟲生怨恨，便是那摩登女子也添愁。借問姑娘何事生愁悶？伊們吃不愁來着不愁，只恨秋凉難以出風頭。喬其紗，印度綢，現今不用要放樓頭；只落得動人情處難披露，辜負了胸前兩個肉饅頭……唱到此處，全座哄堂。</p>

<p>— 吟秋</p>
<p>—萬米競賽二次表演後—</p>
<p>本屆盛大的全國運動會中，不料發生了萬米競賽第一金仲康少跑一圈的問題，因此引起很大的糾紛，不可謂非大會的一件不幸事！當時雖議决把金仲康的第一取消，但是這問題，終覺懷疑？有人說：「萬米賽的名次，是亂點鴛鴦譜」：又有人說：「萬米賽的分數，是一筆糊塗賬；一關心運動的人，没有不在那裏議論着。</p>
<p>自從十九日下午，經過萬米的表演賽後，金仲康結果奪得第一，不過成績稍差，時間比上次慢了兩分鐘；於是又聽到了許多的評論。</p>
<p>有人說：「金仲康的本領，畢竟不凡，他第一次决未少跑一圈，倘若果眞少跑一圈，是他的能力，要在十名以後，安有自不量力？大膽冒險，發起重行表演？萬一眞個落後一圈，比不上人，豈不自暴其醜反足證明確實少跑，更遺無窮的恥辱？　來金仲康愚不至此」。</p>
<p>另有一人說：「金仲康美中不足，便是前後兩賽，成績有兩分之差，未能把人對於少跑一圈的懷疑，洗滌盡凈，這是要加解釋的。」</p>
<p>前人又說：「相差兩分鐘的原因，有好幾個：第一，是這天風大，跑到東司令台時，非常吃力，所以各人成績都差。第二，各人成績，均無特出，故金以保持第一位次爲度，旣無人與之有劇烈的相競，金亦更無突飛猛進的機會。第三，在相距不過幾天的中間，連跑兩次萬米，是要何等力量，今五位運動員，個個連跑二萬米，成績自然應當較遜。第四，更進一步推想，金仲康或許因爲上次成績過佳，反而起人懷疑，遂有少跑一圈的說法；所以這次表演，有意放鬆一馬，减慢兩分，寫寫意意，表示從從容容，已足壓倒餘子，那末上次初賽時，加緊一馬，趕快兩分的位占第一，也是確實無疑的了！」</p>
<p>那人又說：「話雖不錯，反轉來想，金仲康初賽，或許少跑一圈，二次表演的幸而得勝，是爲挽回名譽計，安有不拚命努力，故易得勝；拚命努力之下，雖得第一，而成績究竟還差，還非一圈的關係嗎」？</p>
<p>前人又有解釋了：「金仲康的少跑問題，在正式發表第一之後，起於山西隊的舉發；那末山西隊的運動員谷得勝王正林等，也安有不共同努力，以求保持上次紀錄，或更超過，務使金仲康不能獲得冠軍？那末金的優勝，實非易事！且與賽五人之中，其他四人，任何一人，得到第一，金卽居次，可見金的爭得首席，更將如何困難？而結果卒爲金得，金的實力可知，因此可證金上次的勝爲準確，而少跑反成懷疑了」。</p>
<p>此種表演賽，各員都願參加，這是運動道德的表示，值得吾人欽佩！益證萬米糾紛的責任，不在與賽之運動員，而實應由裁判委員負之；裁判委員的糊塗，遂致鬧這不幸之事，幸有此深明大義的運動員，二次表演，宜乎稱爲君子之爭了。</p>
<p>更有一層，當那决定取消金仲康第一，是根據李文昌所記的十九圈而定。於是黄伯斌竟大受責備，悶損可知，他的憤懣懊喪，不减於金的取消優勝，直到經了二次表演，金的得意可知，而黄也得稍抒鬱積了！</p>

<p>— 止水</p>
<p>英國有一位偵探小說家科南道利，他的作品，從前林琴南譯得很多。西方的文學批評家稱讚科氏的偵探小說是能夠運用近代科學的「成果」，所以雖則詭奇，却不流於荒誕。</p>
<p>那麽，這位科先生對於科學也不是門外漢了，可是歐戰以後我們却聽說這位先生大談起「精靈論」Ｓpiritualism來，立會，出刊物，到處講演。什麽人鬼交通，什麽人類將來，不信者目爲荒唐，信之者　爲啓示，爲預言。</p>
<p>英國還有一位科學小說家威爾斯，他的國際名氣更大，他的「史綱」也已譯成了華文。他的科學小說如「火星與地球之戰爭」前十五年我們就有了譯本。看他的著作，他實在可說是一位道地的科學者。然而前幾天的路透電說他也作了最近五年間的國際政治的預言。</p>
<p>未來的國際政治變化，我們相信是可以推測的，但必須以社會科學的鐵則爲依據，然後不是瞎猜。像威爾斯那樣的「預言」雖然比我們的「堆背圖」之流要漂亮得多，可是我們看來，總覺得有點江湖氣。例如他說將來日美太平洋海戰，日軍先勝，後因梁疫而敗，於是日本國内發生大革命云云，把大革命的因子放在不可知的疫上面。</p>
<p>近來報章頻傳「日俄形勢險惡」而政治觀察者又都謂一九三五年是個難關。人心皇皇，都轉向着「預言」。在這當兒，某雜誌發出了明年正月號的徵文啓事，題目是「上海之將來」，這便是要人家寫點「預言。」雜誌編輯先生的感覺是最最靈敏不過的，他們知道廣大的讀者要求「預言」。本來在這尶𡯓的局面下，許多人迷惘到極點，給一些合理的「預言」也是好事，而且必要。</p>
<p>不過「預言」而一合理，凖要戳破了一部分人的西洋鏡。所以我們倒不妨先來「預言」一下道：</p>
<p>眞正合理的預言，在中國境内，是不會有的。</p>
<h3 id="c277">何謂「演出」？ <a href="#c277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>— 古雄飛</p>
<p>影片「春蠶」公映了，有人批評說是，「人的演出疏落」。</p>
<p>「人的演說疏落」，這是什麽意思？我仔細想了一想，勉强找出了一個解釋：西洋電影廣告常常說演員有幾千人幾萬人，而「春蠶」理面頂多不過二三十個人，大概是說登場的人太少了罷。太少就說太少好了，爲什麽說是「收落」呢？如果「疏落」底反面是「稠密」的話，那麽，多僱些臨時演員，呌他們緊緊擠在一起，攝下影來，就會是一部有「高潮」的片子了！</p>
<p>我不是「影評家」，當然不想在這裏討論影片裡的人是「疏落」好還是「稠密」好，現在想說的是「演出」這個字底意義。生活一天一天複雜，變動，原來的字不夠用，非加多不可。這新字，新造，輸入，都可以，但總得有一個明確的含義。但我們現在却非讀嵌有許多莫明其妙的新（？）字的文章不可。作者好像祗要嵌進一些新字他底文章就會有價值似的。「演出」就是一個。文章裏用它，談話裡用它，但它底含義是什麽却不管，看了聽了實在有些「悶氣」。</p>
<p>原來，這也是一個日本語，一個舞臺劇的術語。</p>
<p>演劇當然要有奸的劇本，但有了劇本並不就有戲看，還有一件重要的事情：怎樣把這劇本在舞臺上具體化。這，日本語呌做「演出」，我們呌做「排演。」分析劇本底主題和情節，分配角色，把舞臺裝置，佈景，以及其他構成演劇的一切東西統一起來，使劇本立體地表現在舞臺上面丨這一個總的過程呌做「排演」。擔負這個工作的人，我們呌做「導演」，日本話呌做「演出家」。至於排演成功了以後，在舞臺上向觀衆公演的時候，對於舞臺的統制，「演出家」　經不管，那是屬於「舞臺監督」底責任了。</p>
<p>一個理想的「導演」，背景，道具是他底材料固不用說，演員也是他底材料，連劇本也是他底材料，他用這些來「創作」；一個好的導演有他獨特的「排演方法」。所以，同樣的劇本在不同的導演底排演之下可以排成相隔很大的東西，而一個壞的導演可以把的劇本弄成一團糟。</p>
<p>最近公演過的「怒吼罷中國」，從許多方面看都是成功的，和「春蠶」底公映應該同樣受到上　文化界底注意。然而，記者這次所得的印象和在日本看築地劇團演同樣劇本所得的印象有許多不同。舉最每一塲說：同樣地是大衆覺醒了，反抗了，但戲劇恊社排演出來的是雜亂的祗是亂呌口號的場面，而築地劇團排演出來的場面却充滿了集體的動的旋律，實際上已突出了狹義的「寫實」的範圍，充滿全塲的不僅是「興奮」，而是整然的「力」底洪流。這，不用說是個導演底排演方法不同底反映，同時也是兩個導演底世界觀底差異程度和戲劇恊社與策地劇團兩個團體性質不同底反映。</p>
<p>至於電影，根本不能用「演出」這個字。因爲、在電影裡面，演的時候並不算是藝術，要用鏡頭從一定的方角攝取了來再映出來才算是藝術。而且，並不是攝來了以後就可以映，還要剪裁排列，重新組織，這在電影製作上有一個特别的術語，是不能與舞臺劇的「演出」混爲一談的。</p>
<h3 id="c278">文人相輕 <a href="#c278" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e278" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">278</a></h3>
<p>— 于時夏</p>
<p>趙翼陔除叢考有文人相輕一篇，述秦漢六朝間文人相輕之故事，亦旣夥頤矣。鄙意文人相輕，權輿周秦諸子。孔子、，『道不同不相爲謀。』諸子各持一說，互相訾毁，此相輕者思想上之偏執也。今諺有云：『同行生嫉妬。』毁他以自譽，申己以絀人，此相輕者心理上之恒情也。又有諺云：『三句不離本行。』自道其工作上之甘苦，兼論同業者之得失，此亦相輕者口語上之結習也。杜句云，『不薄今人愛古人。』發思古之幽情，歎來者之不如古，此相輕者史觀上之謬見也。昔人所謂好丹非素，論甘忌辛，尊古卑今，貴遠賤近，以及黨同伐異，入主出奴等語，似皆不越此四者，明乎此，乃明乎文人之所以相輕也。</p>
<p>自李唐以來，文人相輕之故事，何可勝數？今惟略舉父子同爲文人，而亦相輕者，以見親如父子，亦不相讓。孔聖人但有當仁不讓於師之言，不料竟有當文不讓於父之事也。唐陸餘慶嘗由尚書右丞轉洛川長史，論事則大言不慚，判事則文無是處。有人嘲之云，「說事則喙長三寸，判事則手重五斤。」其子亦嘲之云，「陸餘慶，筆頭無力嘴頭硬。一朝受辭訟，十日判不竟。」送案褥下，餘慶得而讀之，曰，「必是那狗！」遂鞭之。明成化弘治間，李東陽文章爵位爲天下最。一子，名兆先，字貞伯，有一目數行之資，時稱過父，然每厄於科塲，輿情不慊，而主試者多注意尋取，或失或缺，竟弗能中，遂賷志而没。東陽竟絕嗣。兆　好聲妓，東陽罪之，特書其精舍之門曰，『今日柳巷，明日花街。誦詩讀書，秀才秀才！』兆先回，見之，即續書曰，『今日驟雨，明日狂風。爕理隂陽，相公相公！』他如清龔半倫之於其父定菴，郭焯瑩之於其父嵩　，一則　死塗抹其書，以筆敲其木主，一則依百分考績法，僅予其父所作古文五十分，此皆父子同屬文人而相輕者也。</p>
<p>或謂予曰，今日之文人所以相輕，有以異乎古。蓋時至今日，無話可說，幽默而已矣！未知是否，吾將質諸幽默大家林語堂老先生也。</p>
<h3 id="c279">「撲空」正誤 <a href="#c279" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e279" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">279</a></h3>
<p>— 豐之餘</p>
<p>前幾天寫「撲空」的時候，手頭無書，涉及『顔氏家訓』之處，僅憑記憶，後來怕有錯誤，設法覓得原書來查了一查，發見對於顔之推的記述，是我弄錯了。其敎子篇云丨</p>
<p>『齊朝有一士大夫，嘗謂吾曰：我有一兒，年已十七，頗曉書疏，敎其鮮卑語，及彈琵琶，稍欲通解，以此伏事公卿，無不寵愛，亦要事也。吾時俛而不答。異哉此子之敎子也。若由此業，自致卿相，亦不願汝曹爲之』。</p>
<p>然則齊士的辦法，是庚子以後官商士紳的辦法，施蟄存先生却是合齊士與顔氏的兩種典型爲一體的，也是現在一部分的人們的辦法，可改稱爲「北朝式道德』，也還是社會上的嚴重的問題。</p>
<p>對於顔氏，本應該十分抱歉的，但他早經死去了，謝罪與否都不相干，現在只在這里對於施先生和讀者訂正我的錯誤。</p>

<p>— 莫泊桑著李維克譯</p>
<p>「他說過什麽話，這位先生？」</p>
<p>「他說卡魯先生今晚會親自到這裡來。」</p>
<p>勒卡魯先生是和羅蘭老爹有來往的公證人，並還有點兒交誼的朋友。他旣然預先呌人來通知說他晚上要來拜訪，那一定有什麽緊急的重要的事情；於是羅蘭，家四口彼此瞧着，正和一切家産不豐的人怕和公證人發生什麽交涉似的，大家被這消息弄得不安了。因爲在他們腦中，一個公證人的名字是會令人想到條欵，繼取遺産，訴訟，可喜或可怕的事情等一大堆念頭的。爸爸在沉默了幾秒鐘之後，喃喃的說道：</p>
<p>「這究竟有什麽事情？」</p>
<p>陸太太笑了起來：</p>
<p>「不要想了罷，這定是一件關於繼承遺産的事情。我相信一定是的，我是一位福星呢。」</p>
<p>可是他們從來没有希望過什麽人死後能夠遺留一點東西給他們。</p>
<p>對於血族關係有着非常好的記憶力的羅蘭嬷嬷，卽刻便在腦中搜索自己和丈夫兩方面所有的親戚，一面追溯着一代一代的親子關係，一面推尋着堂表兄弟姊妹關係的枝系。</p>
<p>她連帽子都没有取去便問道：</p>
<p>「喂，爸爸，（她在家裏呌她的丈夫做「爸爸」，當着客人面前有時呌「羅蘭先生」，）喂，爸爸，你記得約瑟勒布魯續娶的女人是誰嗎？」</p>
<p>「記得的，一個姓杜美尼的女孩子，一個紙店老閭的女兒。」</p>
<p>「他有孩子嗎？」</p>
<p>「我記得有的，最少有四五個。」</p>
<p>「不對，那麽這方面不會有什麽了。」</p>
<p>她已經熱心的在從事於這種搜索，她渴望着有一注小小的財喜從天空掉落在他們身上。筆爾原是非常疼愛他的母親的，他知道他的母親有點喜歡空想，他恐怕那消息不是好的而是壞的的時候，會使得他母親失望，感着小小的痛苦，小小的悲哀。他阻住她道：</p>
<p>「媽媽，你不要太熱心了，現在已不會再有美國叔父那樣的事情了。據我想來，十分之九」</p>
<p>是來給哲安說親的。」</p>
<p>大家聽着這話都微覺意外，而哲安因爲他的哥哥當着陸太太面前說到這事更加有點佛然。</p>
<p>「爲什麽會是給我說親而不是給你呢？這假設是大有討論之餘地的。你是長子；　理别人」</p>
<p>會先想到你的。並且，我，我不願意結婚。」</p>
<p>筆爾嘲笑他道：</p>
<p>「然則你已是誰的戀人了嗎？」</p>
<p>另一個很不高興，回答道：</p>
<p>「難道一定要做了誰的戀人才好說他還不願結婚嗎？」</p>
<p>「啊！對了，這「還」字改正了一切；你等待着。」</p>
<p>「隨你的便，就算我等待着好了。」</p>
<p>但羅蘭老爹聽着他們的話，思索了一下，突然得到了那最眞似的結論：</p>
<p>「得了！我們這樣挖空腦袋想着眞蠢透了。勒卡魯先生是我們的朋友，他知道筆爾在找尋」</p>
<p>一間診所，哲安在找尋一間律師事務所，他一定是看見有什麽地方適合你們兩人裏間那一個的需用。」</p>
<p>這事是這麽簡單而又可能，所以大家都同意了。</p>
<p>「晚餐預備好了，」使女說。</p>
<p>於是各人走回了自己的房間，以便在坐上餐桌以前，把手洗一洗。（未完）</p>

<p>— 立齋</p>
<p>在咱們這老大民族裏，對於「國」字的應用，是最廣汎而近乎「百貨商塲」性的。</p>
<p>自從海禁大開，洋人東來，若干前進的士大夫鬧着「歐化」，「維新」的「咸同之際」，就有一批頑固的守舊派扛出「國粹」二字，以爲抵抗的武器。這「國粹」云云，一方面對於「國貨文明」，是包羅萬象，一方面又是一切「圖Ｘ」的開山之祖。</p>
<p>停止科舉，開辦學堂，自始迄今，高列在各學校必修科的第一項，許多皓首窮經的老生宿儒弄到「耳順」「古希」之年還只是摸到門檻，談不上「升堂入室」的，是咱們貴國量艱深而絕無範圍的「國文」。</p>
<p>作爲未經整　之中國學術思想之總和，以「康聖人」「章瘋子」爲最拿手，梁賢人胡博士也還不差的，是咱們貴國「頂刮刮」的「國學」。</p>
<p>醫院紛立，「達克突」越混越紅，甚麽「皮下注射」，「愛克斯光」鬧得「莫明其奥」。於是，以「望聞問切」爲手續，以「肝木尅脾土」爲經典的「國貨醫生」們紛起自衛，扛出那與西醫對立的大招牌：「國醫」。聯繫而及，跟着也大鬧其「蒸溜水」與「科學化」的，是「遵古泡製」草根樹皮的「國藥號」。</p>
<p>若干「追隨總理數十年」的「老英雄」一旦「魂不附體」，就下半旗，號召在朝之羣咱與被治之衆來執紼，先撥一批民脂民膏來「治喪」，接着又撥一批國庫來修華表，墓道，翁仲，這一套公式，名呌「國葬」。有些「國葬」事實上打了很大的折扣，只能算是「　葬」。</p>
<p>咱們這民族，遇到相爭相扛，互以惡言相加的時候，往往以涉及至手方母姑妻妹的性器官爲攻擊的中心、　　是阿　檢　的老　　一妙年偶得之一百「國馬」。</p>
<p>梅有五瓣，象徵五權，五院，五族，所以公上尊號曰：「國花」不過自從九一八以來，五族被「友邦」替我們打了個八折，成爲「四喜」，所以，「國花」是否繼續屬梅，似乎還待斟酌一下。</p>
<p>照着干支五行四時八節來紀載時間的過程，吳鑑光，嚴芙蓀，徐遂初和一切希望，迷信的販子們離開了牠就要别圖發展的，是現在又已開始呌賣着的「圖曆」。</p>
<p>孔二先生「三月不知」，只吃不做，以被宰割爲必然歸宿，而且最擅長「不抵抗主義」的，是幽默大師的刊物曾上尊號的「國畜」。</p>
<p>東洋的「友邦」不斷向他們的西方擴大「生命腺」，咱們就不斷喪師失地，弄得古物南遷，人民不安，這一節並未結束的歷史，就是人人皆知的「國難」。</p>

<p>— 敬嘉</p>
<p>電話鈴響了。正在下午二點鐘。太陽光照在東牆脚。</p>
<p>女傭把聽話機拿了下來，放在耳邊「小姐麽？小姐還没起身哩！」</p>
<p>就在這當兒，陶小姐醒來了。在床上打呵欠。</p>
<p>「誰？誰打來的？」懶懶地問着。</p>
<p>「經理先生。」</p>
<p>「把電話移到床邊來！」她命令着，女傭很老練地照着命令做了。</p>
<p>「誰？呀，王先生嗎？你早，我才醒。有什麽事嗎？………好，我一定會來得早一些的。誰？小陳？他在那兒？我不管。那也好。是，對的。對的。再會。」</p>
<p>陶小姐正想把電話掛斷，驀然又想起一句話來，連忙把聽筒放在耳邊。</p>
<p>「喂，王先生，請告訴小陳，今晚可别跟那次一樣。要不然，我不依的。……哈哈哈哈。再會！」</p>
<p>懶懶地掛了電話，伸了一個懶腰。坐了起來。</p>
<p>一個鐘頭後，她才完畢了洗漱的工作。吃了她的早餐，時鐘打四下了。</p>
<p>拿起電話來，撥了一個號碼。</p>
<p>「誰？請呌聲吳先生聽電話。……呀，你是老吳嗎？是的，我才起來。今天晚飯到新雅裏去，好不好？………什麽，你不去？爲什麽？………頭痛？我不依。一定不去？………好，從此你别理我。」</p>
<p>她忿忿地把電話掛斷了，才想轉身，電話又響了。怒冲冲的拿了起來。</p>
<p>「誰？」大聲地呌着。</p>
<p>「小陳？幹什麽？我不去，有些頭痛。是的，頭痛。不是擺架子，你誤會了。……眞的不能去。你看，我的聲音都發抖哩！………」</p>
<p>女傭走了進來：「小姐，吳先生來了。」</p>
<p>陶小姐掛了電話，走到客廳裏。</p>
<p>「好大氣派，我說一句玩話就當眞！」吳先生笑着說。</p>
<p>「你這傢伙！」陶小姐把頭鑽進他的懷中。</p>
<p>「今晚你該到舞廳裏去。今天是盛大的茶舞會哩！」</p>
<p>「當然。我陪你舞。你不准和别人舞。」</p>
<p>「那不行，小陳要囉唣的。」</p>
<p>「不妨。要不然，你得請一天假陪我玩一天。」</p>
<p>「臉不要！」她抓着他的鬍子。</p>
<p>「别抓鬍子！痛啊！你眞是小孩子」</p>
<p>「你是老孩子。」</p>
<p>「哈哈！」老吳笑了：「眞的，你爲什麽老纏着我老孩子？」</p>
<p>「不許你說！」</p>
<p>「哈哈哈哈！」</p>
<p>「這件旗袍又不好看了！」她說，低聲地。</p>
<p>「去買！」</p>
<p>「也該吃飯去啦！」她說：「今晚又得半死半活！」</p>
<p>「好，先去買幾件衣料吧！」</p>
<p>「唔。」</p>
<p>於是他們出去了，坐了汽車。</p>
<p>晚上，她和老吳跳着舞。後來又很小陳跳。在跳舞時，小陳低聲對她說：「你倒底愛我不愛呢？」</p>
<p>「愛你也愛他。」她笑着說。</p>
<p>「爲付麽呢？」</p>
<p>「我愛你，爲了你的臉。愛他，爲了他的錢。」</p>
<p>東方發光了，她帶了疲乏的身子回家。</p>
<h3 id="c284">讀了「花瓶與花瓶架子檢討」之後 <a href="#c284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>前天在本報的春秋欄内讀到敬嘉先生的「花瓶與花瓶架子的檢討」一文指摘拙作「花歟花瓶架子歟」一篇做得有些不自然。然而吾讀了敬嘉先生的大作之後，對於敬嘉先生的高見也很不能滿意，而且覺得有不通的地方，所以吾又不能不出來申述一下。</p>
<p>敬嘉先生旣承認「花瓶」這一個稱呼中是包含着不少的侮辱的成分的。吾想他應該知道侮辱是人人所不願受的，難道吾們女子就應該隱忍這「花瓶」一個稱呼的普遍的侮辱的嗎？他又說想出這個名詞的人徒然自覺難堪，自卑自賤而巳</p>
<p>可是吾可以說事實正和此相反，想出那稱呼的人恐怕正在歡欣欲狂，受人的稱譽呢。敬嘉先生不也是開始就承認了近年來「花瓶」成爲一般有職業的女士的通稱了嗎？你想如果你的思想得到了大衆的附和豈不是一件很足歡樂的事情，有何難堪之有？的確，眞金是不怕火來燒的，不過吾就因爲不能否認職業女子中絕對没有假金混着，而職業男子中也不會純是眞金的。</p>
<p>至於對於「花瓶架子」這個名稱，吾的見解和敬嘉先生的解釋也是完全不同的。敬嘉先生的解釋是以爲花瓶是給架子抬高的，所以說女士必需依賴男士才可增高女士的一切的，可是吾的原意是公司機關中的摩登的女職員莫是裝飾品而被稱爲「花瓶」，公司機關中的摩登男子難道不是裝飾品？裝飾品的女職員旣已被稱爲「花瓶」，那末裝飾品的男職員當然不是「花」就是「花瓶架子」了。「花瓶架子」正是給「花瓶」陷在脚下的，因爲摩登男職員的甘心匍伏於摩登女職員的脚下以侍候她們的正不在少數呢！</p>
<p>至於說有自尊心的人决不會將這些名詞加於他人之身的。這句話好似是很對的，不過就可惜現在的人都没有敬嘉先生這樣明達事理。不然「花瓶」這一個名詞决不會流行得這樣普遍，使敬嘉先生也不能不承認它已成了一般有職業的女士的通稱了。</p>
<p>誠然，社會是需要互助的，决不是男子或女士片面所能成立的，可是在男女平權剛在開始，女子職業剛在萌芽的時候，豈容給他人這樣普遍的摧殘？想出這名稱的不堪的傢貨吾們可以不屑去理會他，可是盲目附和他的人這樣的多，幾乎使全國的職業女子都受到他的影響。吾們女子難道是永遠應該抱着不抵抗主義的嗎？</p>

<p>保安隊乙；這是什麽話？假使日本兵打敗了又怎麽呢？我們就在這兒等死麽？</p>
<p>村長：笑話，日本兵那會打敗的。</p>
<p>保安隊乙：無論如何我們總不能在這兒等着，我們還是大家想法子解開繩子走罷。三爺，你來替我先解。我再來替你們解開。</p>
<p>村長：那不幹，我替你解開了，你跑走，敎我找誰去。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Huang Shaoxiong Invites Various Princes for Discussions: Exchanging Views on Mongolian Affairs and Conveying Central Government Directives; Mongolian Students in Beiping Present Two Suggestions to Huang; Huang and Zhao Scheduled to Depart Today <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) Today at 3:00 PM, Huang Shaoxiong convened representatives of Mongolian princes residing in Beiping for discussions. Those attending included Nayan-tu, Alatan-guazir, Oqi'er-batuqi, Taneqi'er, Bao Wensheng, and others, totaling eight individuals. Huang delivered an opening speech, stating that regarding Inner Mongolian autonomy, everything would be based on the intentions of the Central Government. Mongolian requests for autonomy must seek genuine and effective results. He himself was dispatched to Mongolia to express condolences and would consult on a resolution based on past history and the current situation. Since the establishment of the Republic of China, the country has been plagued by many issues, and relations with various Mongolian regions have not been close. After arriving in Mongolia, he would consult with various princes and strive to realize Inner Mongolian local autonomy. As for the methods of autonomy, he planned to improve the current political and economic situation. Mongolia is making daily progress, and the Mongolian people are becoming healthy members of the Republic of China. Achieving this goal will naturally lead to a close relationship between the Central Government and Mongolia. He will conduct all activities based on the above points. Subsequently, representatives of various princes spoke, expressing their views on autonomy and providing brief reports on the current situation in Mongolia. The meeting adjourned around 4:00 PM. (Special Dispatch from the 26th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) This morning, representatives of the Mongolian Students Association in Beiping, including Kang Ren, Wu Bailing, Bao Yinxi, and seven others, visited Huang Shaoxiong and presented two suggestions: 1. Inner Mongolian autonomy must have an overall plan to avoid being exploited by a few people and creating a divided situation. 2. They oppose Zhangjia entering Mongolia to exploit and deceive the masses and provoke Mongol-Han relations. In addition to issuing a serious warning, they requested an immediate stop and forbade his travel. Huang responded to both points to the satisfaction of the representatives, who then departed. (Special Dispatch from the 26th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Representatives from the Inner and Outer Mongolian Compatriots Association, the Mongolian Relief Committee, Qinghai Province, and the Jerim League, along with six or seven individuals including Song Yongwei, a Duke of the Darhan Prince Banner of the Jerim League, left Beiping for Suiyuan this afternoon to arrange everything in order to liaise with various princes. Wu Heling, the representative of the League Banner stationed in Beijing, will change his departure to tomorrow, departing from Beiping with Huang Shaoxiong and Zhao Bulian. Representatives of various League Banner princes residing in Beiping have been visiting Huang Shaoxiong in recent days, offering their opinions. Huang, seeking broad input, has scheduled a meeting at the Central Hotel this afternoon at 3:00 PM to invite various princes and relevant parties to discuss Mongolian affairs and exchange views, as well as to convey the intentions of the Central Government. (Special Dispatch from the 26th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Wu Heling stated that the current Mongolian request for autonomy can be summarized in eight characters: "Unite internally, resist foreign aggression." He will travel north first to Bailing Temple to meet with De Wang and Yun Duanwangchuke to explain the Central Government's message of condolences. If Huang is unable to directly negotiate with De Wang and others after arriving, he will mediate everything. (Special Dispatch from the 26th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhangjia stated that autonomy is clearly instructed in the teachings of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen and stipulated in the laws of the Central Government. If Mongolian autonomy does not contradict the laws, he, as a national official, will only fulfill his responsibilities to guide and support it. Some accuse him of obstructing autonomy, but discerning people can see through this. The recent advocacy for autonomy in Inner Mongolia has already led to the dispatch of Ji Gong to inspect the truth. After the report, he will naturally follow the Central Government's laws to handle it. It is rumored that the Pacification Envoy only bears religious responsibilities, but from the standpoint of the Great National Master, he naturally bears religious responsibilities. However, from the standpoint of the Pacification Envoy for the Mongolian Banners, he naturally bears political responsibilities. His current departure for pacification is in the name of the Pacification Envoy for the Mongolian Banners. The Pacification Envoy for the Mongolian Banners is specially appointed by the National Government, and all actions, including whether or not to enter Mongolia, are purely based on the orders of the National Government and the Executive Yuan. (Special Dispatch from the 26th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Huang Fu dispatched He Qigong to visit Huang Shaoxiong several times today to discuss matters. He appeared very busy. He Yingqin hosted a banquet at Jurentang tonight for Huang, Zhao, and Qian, and invited Huang Fu to accompany them. During the banquet, they discussed various issues related to national defense and politics. (Special Dispatch from the 26th)</p>

<p>(Beiping) After the order to establish the Administrative Inspector Commissioner's Office for the war zone was issued, it was not established due to rampant bandits in the war zone and insufficient funding. The Political Reorganization Committee recently noted that the banditry in Luandong has gradually been eliminated, and the Receiving Committee has also concluded. All issues will be handled by the Commissioner, and Tao Shangming and Yin Rugeng were specifically ordered to organize it by a set date. Yin is expected to arrive in Beiping from Shanghai on the evening of the 26th, and it can be established in Shanghai by the beginning of next month. Funding has been increased to 1,400 yuan. It is rumored that the first step will be to negotiate with the Japanese side on the issue of receiving the various passes of the Great Wall. (Central News Agency Dispatch from the 26th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yin Rugeng arrived in Beiping tonight and will immediately assume the position of Inspector Commissioner of Ji-Mi. (Special Dispatch from the 26th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The war zone emergency relief conference decided to allocate 200,000 yuan for disaster relief in the affected counties of Chahar Province. (Special Dispatch from the 26th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Yin Rugeng passed through Tianjin at 5:00 PM on the 26th to go to Beiping. According to reports, the Administrative Inspector Commissioner's Office of the Ji-Mi District will be located in Tong County. After arriving in Beiping, he will visit Huang and He, and then come to Tianjin to visit Chairman Yu. All future measures will be handled in accordance with the intentions of the Provincial Chairman. (Special Dispatch from the 26th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The relief associations of various counties in the war zone telegraphed the Legislative Yuan today, requesting the rapid passage of 4 million yuan in relief treasury bonds. (Special Dispatch from the 26th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to an investigation by the relief associations of various counties in the war zone, the losses of public and private property in Tong County after the war amounted to 1,945,453 yuan. There were 21,800 households severely affected by the disaster and 8,700 households moderately affected, urgently awaiting relief. (Special Dispatch from the 26th)</p>
<h3 id="e3">Arita Visits Huang Fu Yesterday: No Mention of Diplomatic Issues <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) Japanese Ambassador Arita visited Huang Fu on the 26th as a routine courtesy call and did not mention diplomatic issues. Rumors of direct Sino-Japanese negotiations and Huang's appointment as Foreign Minister have been investigated and found to be unreliable. (Central News Agency Dispatch from the 26th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Arita, Counselor of the Japanese Embassy, stated that the Ambassador is scheduled to stay in Beiping for one month. Direct Sino-Japanese negotiations are not currently being discussed. Temporary negotiation matters have been discussed with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing at any time. However, the Japanese government sincerely hopes to take advantage of the current improvement in Sino-Japanese relations to jointly solve all outstanding issues with the Chinese government and put the relations between the two countries on the right track. Inner Mongolian autonomy is a Chinese internal affair, and the Ambassador maintains a wait-and-see attitude. The Ambassador plans to visit the embassies of various friendly countries recently as a routine courtesy. The report of the Japanese transfer of the Ambassador to China only appeared in the newspapers, and the Ambassador has not received any instructions. The suggestion that Ambassador Sugimura will succeed as the Ambassador to China is probably unreliable. (Special Dispatch from the 26th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Control Yuan has investigated and confirmed the case of Control Commissioner Zheng Lusheng impeaching Jin Shuren, former chairman of Xinjiang, for causing turmoil in Xinjiang and illegally concluding a new Russian trade agreement. The Control Yuan has now requested the National Government to transfer for disciplinary action, and the criminal matters are also requested to be transferred to the court for handling separately. (Central News Agency Dispatch from the 26th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Control Commissioner Zheng Lusheng submitted a case to the Control Yuan, impeaching Jin Shuren, former chairman of the Xinjiang Provincial Government. The original text stated: According to complaints from the Kashgar Hui Muslim Association of Ping City, the large Ahonghan merchants, Wang Tingtang and others, the Hui merchants Ma Quansheng and others, Xinjiang province popular representatives Fang Benren and others, the Anti-Rebellion Commander-in-Chief of the National Salvation Revolutionary Army stationed in Hami, Bai Xier and others, and Xinjiang province Ai Sha and others, the Chairman of the Xinjiang Provincial Government, Jin Shuren, has committed heinous crimes in Xinjiang, causing popular uprisings, causing divisions between the Kashgar Chantu and Hui Han, killing officials, looting treasuries, and arson, and other crimes. Furthermore, he illegally and privately concluded a trade agreement with the Soviet Union. In addition to notifying the Executive Yuan for investigation, it is now reported that the chairman of the new Xinjiang Provincial Government, Liu Wenlong, reported that former chairman Jin Shuren signed a provisional trade agreement of seven articles with Soviet Russia on October 1, the 20th year of the Republic of China, as well as four attachments. The signing of the agreement and attachments was very secretive, and outsiders were not aware of it. Furthermore, it was not submitted to the provincial affairs meeting, so the provincial commissioners did not hear about it. It was not until August 10, the 21st year of the Republic of China, that the aforementioned agreement and attachments were copied and issued to the secretariat for record keeping. The provisional trade agreement between Xinjiang province and the Soviet Union, along with attachments, is attached. Based on this, the commissioners investigated that the chairman of the Xinjiang Provincial Government and the Soviet government dared to secretly conclude a provisional trade agreement before the formal trade treaty between the Republic of China and the Soviet Union was established, destroying the national system and obviously violating the law. Furthermore, it was not only not submitted to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Industry for approval in advance, but also the provincial commissioners of this government did not hear about it. His secret behavior is especially a violation of discipline, and his crime cannot be excused. Moreover, the agreement has already been implemented, harming merchants and causing suffering to the people, and the consequences are endless. After carefully reading the commercial rights stipulated in the agreement, they have been almost entirely bound by Soviet Russia. Because Soviet Russia has always harbored an ambition for economic aggression against Xinjiang province, the governor, in the name of the chairman of the provincial government, recklessly concluded the agreement without considering commercial conditions and without understanding the national system, oppressing merchants and industries. Now that the merchants and people of Xinjiang are intellectually weak and their hearts are scattered, if they are once deceived by Soviet Russia or Soviet Russia invades, then Xinjiang will surely be the continuation of the Northeast. If a trade agreement is not established and free trade is allowed, and there is something unfavorable, the government can still use its power to come out and set up remedial measures. Now, the sovereignty is lost, the situation is reversed, and what imaginable troubles will there be in the future? In short, the sins of Jin Shuren, the chairman of the new Xinjiang province, are countless, and the case of privately concluding the agreement is especially illegal. If he is not punished, this example will be set, and the harm will be endless. The agreement should be transferred to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Industry for review to protect national rights and alleviate the suffering of the people. As for the points of harming Xinjiang that have been accused one after another in the whole case, they have already led to a major incident. The crime is undoubtedly unconcealable, and it is obvious without investigation. They should be punished separately to warn the greedy and violent, and the relevant criminal points should also be transferred to the court for handling separately, to investigate together, and to confiscate the stolen money. After the investigation results of the commissioners of the court, Luo Jiefu and others, it was considered that the evidence was conclusive and that the impeached person should be transferred for disciplinary action, and the relevant criminal points should also be transferred to the court for handling separately. The court has copied the original case and submitted it to the National Government for disciplinary action. (Special Dispatch from the 26th)</p>

<p>By Wei</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the September 18th Incident in Northeast China two years ago, Japan has been like a wild horse released from its reins. It has rushed madly down a steep and narrow path. What is this steep and narrow path? From the perspective of its internal affairs, it is the accelerated promotion of military dictatorship. From the perspective of its diplomacy, it is the thorough implementation of imperialist policies. Therefore, even insightful people in Japan are worried about it.</p>
<p>In the process of promoting dictatorial politics, its demand is the unification of internal affairs and diplomacy. In essence, it means placing all internal and external affairs under the control of the military. In recent years, parliamentary politics in Japan has been repelled by the forces of the military and has presented a situation of collapse and decline, which is undeniable. And the so-called "Kasumigaseki diplomacy" followers are echoing the military's diplomacy, and every move is subject to the whims of the young officers, which is even more undeniable. Because of this, even Uchida, the so-called "scorched earth diplomacy" selected by the military, resigned because he could not meet their wishes. Then, the only mission of Hirota, who can lovingly assume the position of Foreign Minister, is to strive to establish the so-called "unified national policy" required by the military and fulfill his responsibility?</p>
<p>Hirota came from the Genyosha, a well-known right-wing group, and is known as a rare hardliner in diplomatic circles. He is also a well-known China expert. Furthermore, because his hometown is Fukuoka, he is more closely related to the young officers of the military through hometown ties. His ability to be promoted by the military and become the head of Kasumigaseki has its own origins. Therefore, when he took office, he strongly stated that the relationship between diplomacy and national defense is extremely close and used this as a slogan for leaping diplomacy. It is tantamount to admitting that Kasumigaseki will obey the military's command in the future. And the recent Five-Minister Conference that coordinated national policy was also convened by the military's instigation. Although the details of the national policy coordinated by it have not been fully known, the revealed news is that: "The foundation of Japan's national policy in the future must comprehensively integrate diplomatic, national defense, and industrial policies to form a unified national policy." Secondly, "Especially in this emergency situation, national defense is extremely important, which goes without saying. And diplomacy should be regarded as parallel to national defense. It is through the full implementation of diplomacy that we strive to achieve the peacetime strategization of national defense." Thirdly, "National defense and diplomacy must be regarded as two wheels of the same car, and advance towards the same goal in different ways. Therefore, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Army and Navy must cooperate effectively." From this, it can be inferred that the so-called Hirota diplomacy is backed by arms, based on military preparations, and aimed at implementing the continental policy.</p>
<p>In the cabinet meeting on October 21, Hirota explained his diplomatic policy, stating that he had established definite principles for the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, France, Germany, and our country, and is currently implementing the renewal of diplomacy, starting with the transfer of ambassadors stationed abroad. We will soon witness this new knight perched high on the problem under the command of the Japanese young officers, and will show his skills.</p>
<p>In short, Japan has now started to move forward on a steep and narrow path. We do not need to speculate in advance whether its future will be a blessing or a disaster. Under this circumstance, our country will face great difficulties in the coming days. Hirota once said: "Japan's new diplomatic policy is to cope with the diplomatic crisis of 1935 and strive to maintain peace in the Far East and even the world." Alas. Peace or war. It does not require a wise man to distinguish it. How should our country prepare to deal with it?</p>
<h3 id="e20">Doihara Returns to Manchuria to Stir Up Trouble: The Devil Who Conspired the September 18th Incident and Coerced Puyi to Form a Pseudo-Country Now Suddenly Appears, Said to be Related to Preparing for a Pseudo-Imperial System <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>(Reuters, Tokyo, 23rd) Major General Doihara suddenly returned to Manchuria and is still the Director of the Shenyang Special Affairs Bureau. It is difficult to determine what appointment he holds. Some say it is related to Japan's plan to annex "Manchukuo," but highly qualified observers do not think so. According to general interpretation, Doihara is extremely familiar with the Manchurian Incident, so it is necessary to order him to return to serve in Manchuria. Doihara is fifty years old. Looking at his life, the period of service in the Manchurian military accounts for most of it. He stayed in Manchuria from 1918 to 1932 until May of last year when he was promoted to lieutenant general and returned to Japan to serve as the commander of the 9th Infantry Brigade in Hiroshima. During the September 18th Incident two years ago, Doihara was the Director of the Shenyang Special Affairs Bureau, and Doihara participated in almost all developments. Therefore, people at the time said that if one knew Doihara's whereabouts, one could predict where the next development would be. He was in Shenyang when the September 18th Incident occurred, and he was in Tianjin when Puyi fled. Wherever new incidents occurred, there were his footprints. He is familiar with the situation in Manchuria and participated in various activities, so people call him the Lawrence of Arabia and call him the Japanese Lawrence. After the September 18th Incident, Doihara played a key role in organizing the Shenyang Municipal Government and restoring normal order. Therefore, Doihara was appointed Mayor of Shenyang. His work was quick and efficient, and even the Lytton Commission admitted it. After more than a month, the mayor's seat was given to Zhao Xinbo, and Doihara devoted himself to the movement to organize "Manchukuo." Puyi's entry into Manchuria from Tianjin was carried out by Doihara's party members. The original government later transferred Doihara back to the country. It is said that this was due to the fact that General Ma Zhanshan and General Ding Chao opposed Manchuria, and Doihara could not mediate properly. However, it is impossible to verify whether this statement is credible. Now, after seventeen months, he was suddenly transferred to Manchuria to perform his old duties, which of course aroused speculation among the general public. Some also say that Doihara has the ambition to draft a monarchical constitution for "Manchukuo," and his return this time is for this purpose.</p>

<p>(Beiping) A person arriving from Harbin reports that the atmosphere in northern Manchuria has become tense recently. With Japan and Russia actively increasing their troop deployments, widespread panic has gripped the populace of Harbin. Many predict that a major war between Japan and Russia will break out soon. Japanese newspapers in Harbin are filled with news about Russia increasing troops towards the border, while completely suppressing news of Japanese troop increases. However, Japanese soldiers commandeering carts can be seen everywhere. Japan is increasing its troop deployments on the northern Manchurian border. As transportation is not as convenient as in Soviet Russia, the fear is spreading throughout Manchuria. To avoid Russia understanding their plans, Japan has abandoned railway transport and is instead using large carts. Japanese military authorities are recruiting White Russians in the Northeast to transport them to the northern Manchurian border, selecting those who are skilled to serve as spies. The route Japan uses to transport troops is mostly from Spring northward. The number of personnel from various countries related to Britain and America stationed at consulates in the Northeast has increased compared to before, proving that these countries are paying attention to the Northeast. However, they believe that although the atmosphere between Japan and Russia is tense, a conflict is not imminent for the time being. (26th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(London) The fate of the Simla Anglo-Indian-Japanese triangular conference remains uncertain. Some quarters claim that the conference has already broken down, while a conference of British and Japanese industrialists is scheduled to be held in London next month. At this time, the large expansion of Japanese trade has attracted greater attention from the general public. According to trade statistics for this year, Japan's exports to Britain have increased by 30 to 40 percent compared to last year, with knitted goods, porcelain, paintbrushes, leather, and canned foods being particularly prominent. Japanese light bulbs, at 20 watts or less, sell for only five pence each in Britain. Japanese rubber shoes, which sold only 1.3 million pairs last year, have now increased to 24 million pairs. It is heard that Japan's exports to India and Ceylon have increased by 50 percent compared to last year, with extremely low prices that other countries cannot compete with.

<p>(London) Manufacturers of Egyptian cotton yarn in Manchester have heard that Japanese silk gauze is being sold in the European market at prices 30 to 40 percent lower than the cost of producing the same cotton yarn in Lancashire. They are astonished. It is reported that while the quality and strength of Japanese yarn are inferior to that of Lancashire yarn, they have improved compared to previous Japanese products. Japanese yarn is improving rapidly in this regard and will soon be able to compete fiercely with yarn spun from Egyptian cotton in the world market, similar to its current competition with American yarn.

<p>Santiago, Chile. The Japanese commercial commissioners stationed in Chile and Peru arrived here today. This is widely seen as the vanguard of Japan's deepening economic invasion of South America.

<p>(Tokyo) The reason why Japanese goods have drastically penetrated overseas markets last year is due to advances in production technology and the depreciation of the Japanese currency. However, as a result of the global economic downturn, European and American countries have adopted economic isolationist policies. Britain itself, its autonomous regions, and the Netherlands have all raised tariffs on Japanese goods and implemented various other forms of commercial pressure, raising highly significant questions about the future of Japanese commerce and trade. Furthermore, U.S. President Roosevelt, with the aim of controlling the import of cheap foreign goods, announced the tariff provisions of the National Industrial Recovery Act as part of the industrial recovery movement. As a result, Japanese industries, for whom the United States is the largest customer, have suffered a severe blow. If countermeasures are not taken quickly, they will be left to face their demise. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is currently studying countermeasures. Foreign Minister Hirota plans to use diplomatic means to request the U.S. government to consider applying tariffs leniently to Japanese goods. At the same time, he recognizes the urgent need to implement export controls domestically. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has decided to urge the Ministries of Finance and Commerce and Industry to advocate the implementation of mandatory export controls, submit a revision to the current Export Association Law to the next Diet session, and implement trade policies to prevent improper low-price exports by producers.

<p>(Tokyo) According to news received from the Railway Ministry, the opportunity to reform the organizational structure of the South Manchuria Railway (SMR) is gradually maturing. A large railway union will emerge, encompassing all of the railways in Manchuria and Korea. Hitherto, the control of railways within Manchuria belonged to the SMR proper. However, the Railway General Bureau under the "Manchukuo" railways, which the SMR entrusted with management, was separate, resulting in a dual-headed system and a lack of communication, which was inconvenient. Now, to alleviate future disputes, the government intends to eliminate deficiencies in the control of railways within "Manchukuo." It plans to transfer a portion of the Korean railways to the SMR for management and establish a North Korean Railway Bureau. At the same time, to further simplify matters, the SMR will fundamentally reform its organizational structure as a thorough solution. It will transfer the management of all three entities—the SMR proper, the "Manchukuo" railways, and the Korean railways—directly to the SMR, extending the SMR's mission throughout Manchuria and creating a purely unified policy, thereby increasing the SMR's scale by several times its current size. As a result, the Korean Railway Bureau and the Manchurian Railway General Bureau will be abolished, and railway management bureaus will be established separately in Seoul, Dalian, Shenyang, Changchun, Harbin, and other major cities. Council Member Murakami will soon bring the plan home to consult with various parties. This is the planned schedule. (26th Allied Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Paris) It is learned that a new company organized by shareholders of Banque Franco-Asiatique, the Bank of Chosen, and the Bank of Japan will develop mineral resources in Manchuria. A significant amount of British capital is involved. The company's capital is approximately £50,000 in British gold. Once the "Manchukuo government" approves, work will begin. The mines to be exploited were previously Chinese industries. It is heard that the Bank of Chosen will establish agencies in Seoul to facilitate operations. (25th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Dalian) Reuters has learned today that foreigners, especially the British, have requested permission to explore gold mines in Manchuria, but this has not been approved. The "Manchukuo" government and the Kwantung Army Special Service Agency are currently considering the matter and will soon promulgate a gold mining law. The sum of £50,000 in gold for the new company's capital reported in Paris is considered here to be only the exploration expenses. The exploitation of gold mines in Manchuria has recently been placed under government management. Mining is prohibited until the new law is promulgated. The authorities can only consider private requests after the gold mining law is announced. However, it is generally suspected that the government will buy up all gold mines. It is estimated that the gold mines in Manchuria are worth approximately 500 million Japanese yen. (26th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Harbin) The German Consul-General in Harbin, Balfour-Sessa, visited Consul-General Morishima at 11:00 AM today, stating that the German government hopes to establish economic cooperation with "Manchukuo" and requests understanding, as well as hoping for Japanese mediation. The reason is that Germany, in terms of balancing imports and exports, seeks to maintain a balance that is beneficial to Japan but unfavorable to Manchukuo. In the past, an average of 750,000 tons of soybeans from Manchuria were imported annually through the London market. Now, Germany wants to ship them directly to Germany, and export German products to "Manchukuo." The settlement would be handled through Japanese-German-Manchukuo currency exchanges. Therefore, Consul-General Morishima immediately reported Germany's intentions to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and replied to the German Consul-General, promising to do his best to meet their hopes.

<p>(Tokyo) The most important item in the next year's budget, the military expenditures for the army and navy, have been carefully reviewed by the Budget Bureau of the Ministry of Finance in two meetings. However, this issue cannot be decided based on administrative principles. The Finance Minister should freely decide based on the results of the Five Ministers' Conference. The Budget Bureau has only completed the review in form and submitted it to the ministry council for a substantial decision. The Finance Minister may report the policy decisions of the Five Ministers' Conference at the ministry council and propose an increase in military expenditures. From this, it appears that the total budget amount will not be less than 2.1 billion yen. (26th Nichiren Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The review of the budget for the next year by the Budget Bureau of the Ministry of Finance was completed on the 25th. It was decided to hold a budget ministry council at the Finance Minister's residence on the afternoon of the 27th to finalize the review proposal. The ministry council will take about a week. As a result, the budget cabinet meeting will be held on the 7th of next month. The original review proposal decided by the Budget Bureau this time is as follows: It is essential to incorporate the significance of establishing a future fiscal plan, and the principle of halving new requests should be applied. The army and navy budgets require political recognition from the Five Ministers' Conference, and most of the decisions will be made by the Ministry of Finance and Finance Minister Takahashi's decision. Based on these two guidelines, of the more than 1.4 billion yen in new requests, only 630 million yen were approved. The rest was reduced. However, adding the base budget of 1.42 billion yen for the next year, the total reviewed amount still reaches a considerable 2.05 billion yen. Even if revenue slightly improves, with a natural increase of 80 million yen expected, the deficit bond will still be 586 million yen. The details are as follows: (Expenditure Budget) Expenditure base budget: 1.42 billion yen; New request approval amount: 630 million yen; Total: 2.05 billion yen. (Revenue Budget) Ordinary revenue: 1.26 billion yen; Earthquake reconstruction bonds and railway bonds combined: 25 million yen; Manchurian Incident bonds: 150 million yen; Deficit bonds: 586 million yen; Surplus carried over from the previous year: 29 million yen; Total: 2.05 billion yen. However, after the budget ministry council, considering political considerations in addition to the Budget Bureau's original review proposal, the figures will swell. As a result, the budget for the next year is expected to exceed 2.3 billion yen. (26th Dentsu Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Moscow) According to a semi-official announcement here, the Soviet Russian Committee has instructed its diplomatic representatives in the United States to provide all possible convenience in issuing passports to American citizens who wish to travel to Russia, especially those traveling for business purposes.

<p>(Washington) Reliable sources here tonight indicate that President Roosevelt has no intention of proceeding with the second step in his gold plan, namely, he does not currently want to buy and sell gold abroad to influence foreign currencies. The price at which the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) buys cash will be announced every morning. This price may not change daily if the environment remains normal. (25th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) The French financial community is quite puzzled by President Roosevelt's move to fix the price of newly mined American gold, not understanding its intent. However, one expert stated that American gold production accounts for only 6 percent of the world's total production, so the U.S. president's action cannot have a direct impact on the exchange rate of the dollar or the world gold market. What France wants to know is whether President Roosevelt intends to have the Reconstruction Finance Corporation buy gold in the world market. If President Roosevelt does take this action, France will definitely seek ways to defend itself. (25th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>(New York) The New York Times stated today that President Roosevelt may use the increase in gold prices to entice foreign countries to propose convening a new monetary conference according to the outline favored by President Roosevelt. President Roosevelt seems to intend to gradually increase gold prices to the point that foreign markets cannot or are unwilling to cope with it, in order to seek currency stability through a better plan than the one rejected at the World Economic Conference. Currently, the White House has no further statements regarding future procedures, and no information is disclosed. According to the White House, since the world's countries have not yet announced their financial policies, why should we announce ours alone? (26th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt has received over 2,000 congratulatory telegrams after announcing his monetary program. President Roosevelt is very pleased with the public's welcome. However, Wall Street figures suspect that President Roosevelt still has plans that have not been announced and do not want to preemptively announce any concrete steps in his new program. Officials claim that President Roosevelt does not want to overemphasize the foreign exchange impact of monetary difficulties, as the President does not believe that U.S. domestic politics are related to foreign exchange issues.

<p>(New York) "The Wall Street Journal" published an article titled "Groping in the Dark," stating that if President Roosevelt's plan to increase prices by setting gold prices is imitated by other countries, then the President can cope with it with ease. However, it is doubtful whether the United States can cooperate with other countries in this regard. For example, Britain may not agree with the United States. Although Britain advocates raising the prices of manufactured goods, it does not want to raise the prices of agricultural products and raw materials. The report concludes that the result of this plan will be to promote a competition in international currency devaluation, and speculation is inevitable, especially at the beginning of the experiment.

<p>(London) The British interpret the U.S. government's decision to buy newly mined gold as an attempt to further devalue the dollar, so the dollar exchange rate fell to $4.7925. (25th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(New York) The U.S. government's method of forcibly raising prices by using the increase in gold prices to arbitrarily lower the dollar's value has now begun to be implemented. At 10:00 AM this morning, Reconstruction Finance Corporation Director Jones, Undersecretary of the Treasury Aullison, and Agricultural Loan Bureau Director Morgenthau held a short meeting and announced that the government would buy all newly mined gold from U.S. mines, regardless of quantity, at a price of $31.16 per ounce. However, the procedures for taking delivery after the purchase are still unknown. The new gold price set by the Treasury Department yesterday was $1.56 higher than the previous price, but Wall Street Exchange figures still considered it insufficient. The decision to raise gold prices has already had repercussions in the cotton market, with cotton prices rising by $1 per bale. Market conditions at the stock exchange were chaotic, and various market prices were generally weak. (25th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e37">Countries Construct Tax Barriers; World Economic War to Resume; United States Prepares to Limit Imports; Tariff Truce Practically Collapses; Britain Will Make a Statement After Parliament Reconvenes <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>(London) The economic truce created by the tariff truce proposal, which was once considered to be able to open the door to a worldwide economic peace treaty, is now slowly collapsing. The crisis of a major currency war remains. Once countries reimpose policies to raise tariffs, it could break out at any time. According to well-informed observers here, the main hope for establishing world economic peace lies with U.S. Secretary of State Hull alone. But since news from Washington that the U.S. president plans to immediately exercise the power granted by Congress to raise import taxes, this hope has practically vanished. When Hull attended the World Economic Conference and returned to Washington, he carried back the foundation for an economic peace treaty, which existed in the resolution to extend the tariff truce. But now, three of the 62 countries that promised a tariff truce—the Netherlands, Ireland, and Denmark—have announced their withdrawal and begun to re-enter the path of unrestricted economic warfare. In addition, several other European countries, disregarding the truce promise, have already increased tariffs or drastically changed tax rates. France has also greatly altered its import quotas. Originally, the intention of extending the tariff truce was only to keep it in effect during the Economic Conference. Now that the conference has no prospect of reconvening, and most observers believe that the conference has already died, many countries are no longer willing to retain this constraint. Some newspapers in Britain have demanded withdrawal from the truce. If Britain withdraws, other countries will definitely follow suit, and the tariff truce will immediately collapse. As for the British government's attitude, it will likely make a statement after Parliament reconvenes on November 7. According to the original agreement, anyone wishing to withdraw must give 30 days' notice. (25th Kokumin Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Geneva) Henderson's suggestion that the Disarmament General Committee should extend its session to December 4 has been passed by the main leadership. At the same time, it has been suggested that the main leadership should continue to meet and redraft the disarmament plan based on British Foreign Secretary Simon's declaration of October 14. This suggestion will be submitted to the General Committee meeting tomorrow for approval. Henderson said in a speech at today's main leadership meeting that the British disarmament draft must not undergo a second reading until a large amount of common compromise has been reached. However, preparations should be made urgently so that the second reading can begin on December 4. If the Disarmament Conference shows the slightest unwillingness to complete its work at this critical moment, it will fall into the trap of evil people, and the consequences would be unimaginable. Because they have long spread the rumor that certain powerful countries have no intention of implementing disarmament, this will only give them more justification. The Disarmament Conference must fulfill its responsibility by concluding a genuine disarmament convention within a reasonable period of time. (25th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The steering committee of the Disarmament Conference held a closed meeting today and decided to recommend to the General Committee that the General Committee meeting scheduled to open on the day be postponed to December 4. As for the work of the steering committee itself, it was decided to continue during this holiday and retain complete freedom to adopt any method. According to the program adopted today, the steering committee intends to revise several articles of the disarmament draft, based on the recent consensus of various countries' mutual consultations, and will use the results of future negotiations to draft the final draft of the disarmament convention, and then submit it to the conference for discussion at the next General Committee meeting. Furthermore, when the steering committee discussed how to draft the disarmament convention today, the Italian representative, Mr. Saragna, expressed his opposition to the committee drafting the convention in its final form and then handing it over to Germany to adopt or reject it. The general opinion of the League of Nations is that this view should be avoided in the future to give Germany more room to maneuver. (25th Kokumin Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The General Committee of the Disarmament Conference today listened to the remarks of Chairman Henderson, who said that the negotiations will be conducted by the steering committee to resolve the existing differences, and that a clear full draft of the convention will be placed in the hands of the representatives of various countries by December 4. The steering committee or any committee it organizes shall have the power to contact representatives of any country, and in particular should consult with representatives who have submitted amendments. If necessary, the meeting scheduled for December 4 may be postponed. (26th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Paris) After being ordered to form a cabinet, former Navy Minister Sarraut actively sought opinions from all sides this morning. The Secretary-General of the Radical Socialist Party met with Mr. Sarraut and informed him that all members of the party expressed goodwill towards Mr. Sarraut. Former Prime Minister Herriot, the leader of the party, who is recuperating in the south, also informed him by telephone that he also expressed sympathy for Mr. Sarraut. Mr. Sarraut then attended the plenary meeting of the Radical Socialist Party's parliamentary group in the House of Representatives and issued a brief statement expressing his determination to form a cabinet and continue to follow the foreign policy of the previous cabinet. As for restoring budget balance, Mr. Sarraut believed that it was impossible to increase the national burden at this time. He advocated reducing tax rates to encourage national economic activity. He also advocated taking various measures to promote the progress of social undertakings. After the meeting, Mr. Sarraut continued to consult with political friends on the matter of forming a cabinet. Most political figures expressed sympathy to him. Mr. Sarraut was scheduled to continue seeking opinions at 3 pm, and will meet with former Finance Minister Painleve. Around the evening, Mr. Sarraut could draft a list of the new cabinet and submit it to President Lebrun for review. Political circles believe that Mr. Sarraut's intention is to organize a concentrated cabinet at the moment, which may not be possible. Therefore, the political color of the new cabinet will not be much different from the previous cabinet. Most cabinet members will be members of the Radical Socialist Party. Some ministries will be given to left-wing Republicans, which is only slightly different from the previous cabinet. According to this newspaper, the list of the new cabinet is as follows, but it may be changed again. Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sarraut (former Navy Minister), Deputy Prime Minister and Justice Poncet (former Foreign Minister), Army Daladier (former Prime Minister), Finance Painleve (unchanged), Interior Chautemps (unchanged), Aviation Cot (unchanged). (Havas dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Sarraut stated today that there would be no changes to the policies towards Germany and disarmament. The new cabinet will proceed in accordance with the policies of the previous government, and said that a coalition cabinet is not the time yet. Therefore, his cabinet organization is the same color as the cabinets of Herriot and Daladier, mostly figures from the Radical Party, but more centrists must be added. The new cabinet is expected to be formed tonight, and it is expected that Daladier will be the Minister of the Army and Painleve will remain the Minister of Finance.

<p>(Paris) Sarraut has been tasked with organizing a new cabinet, and claimed tonight that he does not want to waste time now, but it cannot be done immediately. The overall situation seems very serious and chaotic, and everything should be discussed carefully. He hopes to complete his task. According to reports, Sarraut was originally a lawyer and also a columnist for newspapers. In 1902, he was elected as a member of the House of Representatives. In 1905, he entered the government as Undersecretary of the Interior until 1907, during Clemenceau's Tiger Cabinet. From 1911 to 1919, he served as the Governor-General of Vietnam. In 1926, he joined the Poincaré cabinet as Minister of the Interior, and then served as Minister of Colonies in the Herriot and Poncet cabinets. (Reuters dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Mr. Sarraut is 61 years old this year. He started as a lawyer and served as the Governor-General of Annam for many years. Mr. Sarraut has participated in many cabinets, and he also served as the Minister of the Interior in the most famous Poincaré National Unity Cabinet. He also published a newspaper with his brother, which is one of the most famous provincial newspapers in France. (National Telegram on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Paris) After the failure of the French Daladier cabinet, no matter what faction of government is organized, the issue of currency inflation will definitely be the most fiercely debated topic in this parliament. According to the budget compiled by the Daladier cabinet, there will be a deficit of more than 58 million British pounds. There are only four ways to remedy it: (1) increase taxes, (2) further reduce expenditures, (3) issue new debts, and (4) inflate the currency. The first type, increasing taxes, will definitely become the political suicide of the new government if adopted under the current circumstances. Powerful anti-tax increase associations have been organized throughout the country, and representatives from all walks of life, including farmers and workers, have joined. However, the trend of tax evasion in France is very prevalent. The new government will definitely try to stop this kind of loophole. Regarding the second type, further reducing government spending, it is only possible to cut staff and reduce salaries. However, the Daladier government failed because it wanted to reduce salaries. When the last parliament adjourned, it had already passed a salary reduction averaging about 13%, so it is difficult to reduce it again. The third type, issuing new public bonds, although it is a temporary relief measure, its difficulty may not be less than increasing taxes. The recent two public bonds issued have not been enthusiastically subscribed. Now, French investors are already showing signs of nervousness and will hesitate to move forward. Since the above three methods of raising funds have their own difficulties, it is expected that the proposal to inflate the currency will be submitted to the parliament. However, in view of the tragic situation of the franc's sharp decline in 1926, there will inevitably be many who strongly oppose it. Therefore, French economists believe that the issue of currency inflation is inevitable to be submitted to the parliament. In the fierce conflict of opinions on this issue, the life of the new cabinet may not be long. (National Telegram on the 26th)</p>

<p>(Moscow) According to a dispatch from Tehran, Persia via Peking, British naval authorities recently arrested an official from the Persian tax office on Qeshm Island in the Persian Gulf. In response to the protest from the Persian government, the British authorities claimed that the island belonged to the British government and that the tax official violated the regulations of the island. When the Persian Foreign Minister spoke about this matter in the parliamentary session, he severely criticized the British note and pointed out its strange motives that shocked the Persian government. He also said, "The British authorities are like the masters of the area and prevent Persia from realizing its sovereignty." He strongly asserted that the island's area is Persian territory, which is beyond question. The island has not recognized the existence of British territories or British government ownership in the past, and will not recognize it in the future. (TASS dispatch on the 25th)</p>

<p>(Berlin) The "Liberation Memorial" was erected in Kehlheim near Bad Abbach in Germany. The unveiling ceremony was held on the 22nd of this month. Afterwards, a famous British journalist, Penderel, was arrested in Munich. Mr. Penderel is a correspondent for the Daily Telegraph stationed in Germany. After the arrest, the British Consul in Munich went to the prison to visit, but was refused. Today, the British Embassy in Berlin protested to the German Foreign Office about the arrest of the journalist and the refusal of the consul. The reason for the arrest is as follows. The German authorities had notified reporters that the facts that occurred during the unveiling ceremony should not be fully published. However, the British journalist Penderel did not comply with this notice and recorded the situation on that day in great detail. First, he recorded Hitler's speech, and then described Hitler's review of 20,000 heavy troops of the National Socialist Party. He also said that after the review, there was a night procession, and the party members sang a new party song, the lyrics of which were "The German people are on the alert." All members of the National Socialist Party's Stormtroopers, the National Defense Army, and the Gendarmerie participated in the procession. Because of this record, the German authorities accused Penderel of being a spy and arrested him. (Havas dispatch on the 25th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Qin Fen, Secretary-General of the Economic Commission, returned to Beijing on the morning of the 26th after visiting Song in Shanghai. According to reports, this visit to Song was to request instructions on personnel matters of the commission and to agree on the budget amount of the commission. He visited Standing Committee Member Wang this morning, and the budget amount of tens of thousands of yuan per month has been approved. There is no concrete decision on the construction costs. Song is very busy planning finances in Shanghai and can come to Beijing next week. The Economic Commission will hold a standing committee meeting as soon as Song returns to Beijing, and there will be important discussions on economic construction. The plenary committee meeting has not yet been scheduled. The grain control association is in the planning, but the establishment date must be decided by the standing committee. In addition, economic experts Maar (French) and Salda (British) will arrive in China within a month at our invitation. (Central Telegram on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Qin Fen said, (1) The task of my trip to Shanghai was that after the commission was formally established, the first standing meeting was held on the 4th of this month. The new budget for the administrative expenses of the commission has not been submitted. Now that the end of the month is approaching, I specifically visited Standing Committee Member Song to request instructions on how to handle it. It is tentatively set to allocate more than 20,000 yuan per month first. (2) Regarding the rumors that Song has resigned as Minister of Finance and that the resignation has been submitted, this is Song's personal matter, and it is not convenient to express any opinion. The talks in Shanghai yesterday proved that the resignation rumor was not true. Song said that he would return to Beijing next week. (3) The Cotton Industry Control Association of the commission has been established. Other associations for grain and coal are indeed under discussion. When they will be realized is difficult to say. Since the commission changed its system, all facilities are waiting for the meeting to decide. After meeting with Wang and Song, they both said that they would hold a standing meeting next week, but the plenary meeting has not been scheduled. The committee members are located in the north and south. If it is necessary to hold a meeting, a notice must be issued ten days in advance. (4) British economic expert Maar and French economic expert Salda are world-renowned economic doctors. They recently came to China to inspect China's economic construction and are being consulted by our government. They will soon depart from Europe. (Special Telegram on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Economic Commission has not held a meeting since the first standing committee meeting. It is planned to continue the meeting next week.

All personnel of the Economic Commission are appointed by the former preparatory office personnel and have not been added. The administrative expenses of the commission are more than 20,000 yuan, which has been approved by Minister of Finance Song. (Special Telegram on the 26th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) A certain diplomatic authority said, (1) Direct negotiations between China and Japan are impossible from any point of view. The report from Vietnam is purely Japan's attempt to create the impression that the Chinese authorities in North China are acting as local negotiators, forming a means of recognizing the puppet organization. However, our diplomacy is a whole policy, and all kinds of rumors are not worth laughing at. (2) Although the situation between Japan and Russia is serious, it is not as serious as publicized. Whether war can be avoided or not, the international situation is changing rapidly and difficult to predict. (3) The resumption of diplomatic relations between the United States and Russia has been brewing for a long time, and it has only now begun to take concrete action. Objectively, it is indeed quite possible. What the conditions are is difficult for outsiders to know. Whether the resumption of diplomatic relations will be successful is impossible to say. If it becomes a reality, it seems to promote peace in the Far East. (4) After Germany withdraws from the League of Nations, it must still fulfill its obligations to the League of Nations within two years, which has no major impact on our country.

<p>Changchun Correspondence. Recently, Zhang Daojinghui, Minister of Military and Political Affairs of the puppet organization, published "The Military and Political Affairs of Manchukuo," revealing the situation of the puppet organization's military and political affairs, which are entirely trained and compiled by the Japanese. The military officers are also Japanese, probably to prevent the puppet organization from defecting. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e95">History of the Puppet Military and Political Affairs <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the puppet organization's Ministry of Military and Political Affairs in March of the first year of Datong, General Ma Zhanshan, due to the loss of the Hu-Hai Road and the temporary government of Hailun Province being under heavy military pressure, and because he was isolated and without assistance, had to temporarily respond to the Japanese threats. He also wanted to probe the truth of the Japanese army and the inner workings of the puppet organization, so he endured humiliation and temporarily assumed the position of Minister of the puppet Military and Political Affairs. After only two months, General Ma secretly revolted, leaving the puppet ministerial position to be concurrently held by Deputy Minister Wang Jingxiu. However, the real power of the military and political affairs was completely controlled by the Japanese, and the general puppets were no different from walking corpses. A puppet Central Training Office was also established, which only admitted the children of puppet officers. The director was concurrently held by Wang Jingxiu. The office was located in Liaoning and hired Japanese as instructors, using this to build the foundation of Japanese-puppet friendship. A puppet military training department was established, with Wang Zhiyau appointed as the colonel chairman, specializing in using propaganda materials such as texts and cartoons to lure and anesthetize our compatriots. It also published the "Military Weekly," which was distributed to various units of the puppet army to induce soldiers to absolutely obey the puppet organization, confirm Japan as a friendly country, and not to resist. In the name of unifying horse administration, the military animal husbandry farms of Heilongjiang Province were ordered to be directly under the jurisdiction of the puppet Ministry of Military and Political Affairs.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Establishment of Military Propaganda Department <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>From September of the first year of Datong to May of the second year, it was a period of military affairs, but the volunteer army continued to rise up, and the military period was extended. A puppet military propaganda department was established, publishing propaganda materials such as the "Military Weekly" and slogans, leaflets, cartoons, and military pamphlets, which were distributed to each puppet army unit, one copy per person. Airplanes were also used to fly to various places to distribute them, anesthetizing soldiers and the people, falsely singing the Wangdao Doctrine, and intending to make the puppet army recognize the Chinese as enemies and regard the Japanese as friendly countries. Every week, Japanese military officers gave lectures to the puppet army, which were translated by traitors, saying that the puppet army must be directly under the jurisdiction of the Japanese army. Everyone must never recognize themselves as a Chinese nation. All the pamphlets issued must be memorized. If anyone is illiterate, they must remember them firmly during the lecture. Otherwise, if they cannot answer when asked, they will be severely punished. In order to eliminate the power of our volunteer army, the Japanese also rewarded those who reported the family members of the volunteer army after they were discovered by the puppet army, and those who knew but did not report were guilty of treason. After the Yuguan Incident and the fall of Rehe, the Japanese and puppets considered the military affairs to have come to an end, so they changed the "Military Weekly" to the "Elite Military Weekly." Japanese language training classes were added to the army to assimilate our nation, so that the puppet army would lose its national concept, be loyal to the Japanese and puppets.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Japanese Undertake Military Surveying <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese invasion of the Northeast in military affairs used all possible means. After the establishment of the puppet organization, the Japanese used the slogan of Japanese-puppet friendship to anesthetize the ignorant Northeast compatriots. Regarding important military matters, military surveying and military maps are based on the Japanese-puppet agreement. All military surveying of the puppet country is undertaken by the Japanese. In name, a surveying section is added to the staff department of the puppet Ministry of Military and Political Affairs to assist the entrusted agency in handling surveying administrative matters, but in reality, it is entirely controlled by the Japanese. Because military surveying is related to national defense secrets, it is feared that it will be spied on by foreigners. Therefore, regarding military surveying, after the puppet country's surveying department has measured the detailed map, it will be printed and forwarded to the puppet Ministry of Military and Political Affairs by the Japanese Army Surveying Department, and then forwarded to major bookstores for public sale by the surveying section within the puppet Ministry of Military and Political Affairs. The procedures are very cautious.</p>

<p>After the establishment of the puppet organization under Japanese patronage, all the Northeast armies revolted one after another. In order to prevent the activities of the volunteer army, the Japanese recruited unemployed workers, peasants, and youths day and night for training to form a basic army. On the one hand, they could be loyal to the puppet country, and on the other hand, they could strike at the volunteer army and maintain local stability. However, the volunteer army's momentum was too great, and there was nothing to be done. Therefore, people were sent to buy them off, but this was not very effective. Seeing this, the Japanese military department forcibly selected 400 Japanese military academy students and sent them to the Northeast to organize and train the army, and strictly monitor the army to prevent any defection. These young military officers went to the Northeast in September of this year and were assigned to the puppet army to take charge of affairs. In reality, the Japanese military department is using this to prevent the army from defecting and can implement a kind of military invasion in advance. (Northeast News Agency)</p>
<h3 id="e99">Local Austerity Plan in Bandit Suppression Areas: He Jian Formulated Eight Items; Jiang Clarified and Ordered Compliance <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence. Chairman Jiang, in response to He Jian's presentation of eight austerity plans for local expenditures in counties within the western bandit suppression area, which were reviewed and approved yesterday, issued separate instructions for compliance and also instructed the provincial governments to inform them. The original presentation and instructions are as follows:</p>
<p>He Jian's presentation stated: "One, it is to present eight austerity plans for local expenditures in counties within the bandit suppression area under our jurisdiction, requesting review and approval. Our department has, for the finances of each county within the bandit suppression area, formulated seven key points for the reorganization of county local finances, which have been approved by Your Excellency based on the administrative implementation plan and the promulgated regulations for reorganizing county local finances, and promulgated to each county, with separate documents presented for review and approval on file. I believe that the usual administrative expenditures of each county within the bandit suppression area must first strive to tighten them up in order to provide relief and conform to the principles of reorganization. Therefore, I have established eight austerity plans for county local expenditures based on the provisions of the second section and second item regarding usual administration in the plan, clearly defining standards to avoid disputes. In addition to issuing orders to each county within the bandit suppression area to comply, and notifying each competent provincial government for review and transmission, I have compiled and presented the plans with this document to Your Excellency for review and approval, which would be very convenient."</p>
<p>Chairman Jiang's instructions stated: "One, all submitted documents are understood. After reviewing the eight austerity plans for county local expenditures, there are still areas that should be considered. Specific instructions are given below. (1) The first item of the plan should be changed to: 'In each county within the bandit suppression area, the local administrative organs are the county government, the county finance committee, and the county clearing and resettlement committee. However, if a finance bureau has already been established and is jointly managed by the county, without additional expenses, it should be retained. Otherwise, no other redundant organs are allowed.' (2) The fourth item of the plan should be changed to: 'For each county's financial matters, all matters relating to the collection and remittance of provincial taxes are handled by the county government or the county finance bureau. All matters relating to county local finances are handled by the county finance committee. With the exception of the county finance committee's expenses, all financial administrative expenses for county funds are discontinued.' (3) The seventh item should be changed to: 'Charitable undertakings, with the exception of established medical institutions which should be retained, vaccination and epidemic prevention matters which should continue to be carried out, and relief, appeasement, and accommodation during the clearing and suppression period which are most urgent, should all be merged into the county clearing and resettlement committee for concurrent management. Other matters that can be delayed should have their expenses discontinued.' (4) The second, third, fifth, sixth, and eighth items of the plan are all acceptable and are approved for implementation. The following four items, after being revised separately by the General Headquarters, should be resubmitted for record. There are also additional instructions for implementing the austerity measures: (1) The local areas of Gao'an, Anyi, Yongxiu, Qingjiang, Xiajiang, Ji'an, Wuning, Xiushui, Jing'an, and Pingxiang in Jiangxi Province are considered tranquil, and the public security expenses are available, and the management is relatively successful. The public security bureaus of each county should be exempted from merging according to the other provisions of item two of the plan. (2) In the future, for each county that merges public security bureaus, the police officers who are physically strong, have been trained, and have firearms can be temporarily incorporated into the defense team, but the number of people, expenses, firearms, and other items to be merged must be compiled and sent to the competent provincial government for the record. (3) The education expenses of Gao'an, Anyi, Qingjiang, Wuning, Pingxiang, Yichun, and Fengxin in Jiangxi, are more than 30,000 and less than 10,000 yuan. The schools are still developed, and the results are good. The education bureaus of each county should be exempted from merging according to the other provisions of item three of the plan. (4) The various expenses for judicial administration in each county, which were originally paid by the provincial treasury, are still paid by the county government or finance bureau under the provincial tax item. In addition to ordering the Jiangxi provincial government to be informed, they should immediately investigate and handle. "(October 24, Datong News Agency)</p>

<h3 id="e101">Impressions of Changsha <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Changsha Correspondence. It is very convenient to travel from Xiangtan to Changsha, with ships on the water and cars on land. The reporter took the 4:00 AM boat and arrived in Changsha around 9:00 AM. According to Jin Zhuangchun, the section chief of the secretarial department of the provincial government, the general situation of Hunan Province's construction and the strategy of suppression is roughly: "Our Hunan has been troubled for many years. In 1911, it suffered a red disaster. Before it had time to recuperate, an unprecedented flood in the following year flooded the entire territory. The bandits in the border area also took the opportunity to stir up trouble. Last year, the financial situation became even more depleted due to the abundant disaster, and both cities and rural areas suffered the consequences. Fortunately, it has now managed to overcome the difficulties and is gradually reaching a better state. As for the strategy of suppression, military and political affairs have always been used together. Military force can only suppress tangible bandits, while politics can clear intangible bandits. Specifically, in addition to trying our best to publicize the Three People's Principles and severely refute communism, we are also strictly conducting census, handling joint security, and paying special attention to neighboring bandit areas and recovered bandit areas. Considering its effect, when forming joint security, suspicious people will not be able to join. After joint security is formed, they will supervise each other, so that bandits have nowhere to hide. They advise each other not to work in Hunan, so it is generally recognized that this is an important matter for suppression, and it is still being worked hard. As for construction matters, such as highways, agriculture and forestry, mining, industry, commerce, and water conservancy, each has a dedicated agency to implement according to plan."</p>
<p>Changsha is the capital of Hunan Province, with many agencies and a dense population. It is also known for its convenient water and land transportation, and industry and commerce have always been developed. However, according to Han Zigang, a friend who has been doing business in Changsha for a long time, "The business of various industries in Changsha City was very prosperous in the past. After the devastation of Lord Yang and the trouble of the red atmosphere, the countryside has been collapsing day by day, and the villagers have been flocking to the cities. Although the population has increased, the purchasing power has decreased, and business failures due to frequent taxes and difficult capital turnover are heard every day. " I then visited Taixin Park. On the way, on the doors of the people's houses, I often saw the words "Residence of officials, no disturbances allowed" written by Commander-in-Chief He. The government is deliberately protecting the residence of civil servants, but it seems that there is no such thoroughness for civilian residences. I then entered the park, climbed up to Tiangong Pavilion, which is as high as the factory chimney. Looking down on the whole city, there is a panoramic view. The pavilion hangs many plaques and couplets of celebrities, and there are children's sports grounds and zoos, etc., but the scale is very small. The forests and lawns, as well as the parks, are not very large. Leaving the park and heading south for about a mile, there is Baisha Well, a famous well in Changsha. The spring water protrudes from the ground, shaped like Baotu Spring in Jinan. Watermen take it in turn, and it is endless day and night, because each load of river water costs only a few copper coins, while this can be sold for a dollar or two. Crossing the Xiangjiang River and heading west for about seven or eight miles is Mount Yuelu, the first scenic spot in Changsha. The houses at the foot of the mountain are arranged like stars. It is the former Yuelu Academy and the current Hunan University. On the mountainside are the tombs of Cai Songpo, Huang Xing, and others. In the lush forest and bamboo, there are many ancient temples and monasteries, which are worth visiting. The temple on the top of the mountain, named Yunlu Palace, rises above the clouds. Climbing up, you can see the colors of the mountains evenly divided, and the Xiangjiang River surrounds it. It is truly a scenic spot. At that time, there were five or six Japanese people carrying cameras and telescopes, taking pictures of all the scenic spots and arbitrarily looking at the high and distant places with mirrors, recording them one by one. These people once surrounded and read an ancient plaque, and did not leave for a long time. The reporter wanted to take a picture and asked them not to block the object, but they simply ignored it. It is regrettable that the guest is acting as the host.</p>

<p>Xu Yapin, a resident outside the West Gate of this county, has been working as a partner in Shenchang Rice Shop. He married Zhang, who is now twenty-two years old. They have been married for almost six years, but she is naturally frivolous and fond of embellishment. Xu has repeatedly advised her to change her ways, but to no avail. Recently, she had an affair with a monk named Changrong from Zhizhi Nunnery. The monk, on the twenty-fourth, took advantage of Xu's absence to collect debts and went to Zhang's residence to spend the night. Unexpectedly, Xu returned home around eleven o'clock that evening and knocked on the door. Zhang opened the door, and Xu noticed her flustered appearance. He then searched the house and dragged Changrong out from under the bed. He then took both Changrong and Zhang to the Third Public Security Precinct to report the incident. After preliminary interrogation by Inspector Qu, the case was deemed to involve adultery and was transferred to the County Court Procuratorate for investigation yesterday. The plaintiff was ordered to return home, and the two defendants were detained pending review.</p>

<p>The labor dispute at the Dingjia Lane Railway Hotel once led to a city-wide strike. The standoff between labor and management has lasted for months without resolution.

<p>The Wuxian Women's Association, recognizing the large number of private prostitutes in Suzhou, believes that they should be cracked down on. The board of directors has decided to establish a reformatory for prostitutes, conduct a survey of the prostitute population in order to persuade them to reform, and also send a letter to the Minsheng Singer and Dancer Association, urging them to register with the association as soon as possible. However, the financial problem is extremely difficult, and they are currently looking for solutions.</p>

Starting from November 1st, a special training class will be organized, requiring district chiefs to send corps members to the county before the 25th of this month. The examination will be held on the 16th. The location of the special training class is the former site of the Labor Hospital in Ba'er Lane. Yesterday was the examination date. One hundred and sixty-three corps members reported for the examination. At 8 a.m., the examination was held at the police training school of the Public Security Bureau. County Magistrate Yan Shenyu and Directors Zhu and Xu were present to supervise the examination. The examination subjects included Chinese language, Party ideology, arithmetic, practical military skills, and command (platoon training). In the afternoon at one o'clock, the physical fitness of the corps members was also examined. Currently, sixty students have been admitted. However, because the number of applicants was insufficient, a supplementary examination will be scheduled and classes will be held again.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Police Officer in Disguise Captures Bandit, Solves Case <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Qu Haitao, an employee of Deda Coal Oil Company near Tonghui Bridge in this county, went to Huishan with two friends around one o'clock in the afternoon the day before yesterday. They returned to the city around seven o'clock that evening. While passing the intersection of Wulijie and Shanlukou, they were suddenly accosted by four thugs who brandished pistols and blocked their way. They were stripped of three long robes, robbed of sixty yuan in cash, a gold watch, and a gold ring. After the robbery, the bandits fled towards Shanwan. Afterwards, Weng and others reported the incident to the Fourth Public Security Bureau and requested an investigation. Director Fan of the bureau immediately ordered Patrol Chief Wang Zhenbin of the precinct to pursue the stolen goods. Around six o'clock in the evening yesterday (the 25th), Patrol Chief Wang led five or six police officers in disguise to ambush the scene of the incident. He also ordered another plainclothes police officer to pose as a pedestrian walking on the road. Sure enough, four bandits suddenly emerged from Songfen, intending to rob. The police officer, upon seeing this, sounded a police whistle. The ambushing police officers, upon hearing the signal, stepped forward to arrest them. One bandit was caught on the spot, and the original stolen goods were found on his person. The other three escaped. Patrol Chief Wang then took the captured bandit to the bureau, where Director Fan conducted a preliminary interrogation. The bandit confessed his name as Sun Zhongying, a native of Suzhou, twenty-seven years old, and a soldier in the Fourth Company of the Second Battalion of the 522nd Regiment of the 211th Brigade of the 87th Division in Nanjing. He confessed that he had deserted from Wuxi three days ago and had resorted to robbery. After obtaining the confession, Director Fan immediately prepared a document and submitted it to the General Bureau for interrogation. At the same time, Patrol Chief Wang and the First Precinct continued to apprehend one suspect each, and investigations are currently underway.</p>

<p>The Jiangdu Detective Team previously cracked a kidnapping case in the Jurong area, arrested the bandits, and rescued the victims. According to the confessions of the bandits, many accomplices were involved. They subsequently arrested more bandits in Zhenjiang and the eastern townships of the county, and seized firearms, boats, and stolen goods. From the confession of the arrested bandit Zhou Er, it was learned that Gu Henglou, who lives near Xinghua Bridge outside the North Gate of Taixian County, has many followers, mostly bandits. Gu sits and distributes the spoils, and Wang Xiaobianzi is Gu's only henchman, committing numerous crimes. After obtaining the confession, County Magistrate Ma secretly ordered Police Captain Zhu Xinke and Detective Li to disguise themselves and go to Tai to investigate. They learned that Gu has considerable influence in Taixian County, lives in a large Western-style house, behaves extravagantly, and associates with officials and gentry. Local people mostly call him "Second Master Gu." The team leader and others initially did not dare to act rashly, so they first submitted a document to the Taixian County Government, requesting assistance from the team. Detectives first entered the door, pretending to be Gu's followers, and were admitted. Before they could speak a few words, the detectives drew their guns, preventing any outcry. They then notified the detectives outside the door to enter and search the house. They found a box cannon and a pistol, as well as more than thirty packets of red pills. At the same time, they arrested Wang Xiaobianzi in the Xiaba area. They dispatched a special ship to escort them to Yangzhou. It is said that Gu is fifty-one years old, very strong, and has been in Tai for many years, possessing considerable assets. Wang is thirty years old. Both are from Funing. It is said that in 1930, the Hua Fei murder case in Ganshu Town, District 8 of the county, where Hua Fei held a birthday celebration for his mother, was committed by them. Wang was involved in the "First Army Under Heaven" discovered at Luyang Lake recently, serving as the captain, with most of the weapons and ammunition being provided by Gu. Many other major robbery cases are also involved.</p>

<p>District 10 of this county was occupied by a large group of bandits for several months this summer. Later, the county government telegraphed Commander-in-Chief Chen, who sent Battalion Commander Li Jiuzeng to lead a team to suppress the bandits, and the bandits fled elsewhere. When Battalion Commander Li was transferred away, the bandits sneaked back to Gaoyou. At six o'clock in the morning the day before yesterday, about eighty bandits suddenly appeared in Dongjiadun, District 10, each carrying firearms, planning to occupy the area. The township head sent someone to sound the gong, gathering more than two hundred members of the civil defense, who opened fire on the bandits. Until eight o'clock the next morning, the bandit forces were unable to withstand and fled to the southeast.

<p>Finance Minister Song Ziwen summoned Vice Minister of Finance Zou Lin and other senior officials to the Ministry of Finance office at around eleven o'clock yesterday morning to discuss important financial matters, which lasted for a long time. It is reported that Mr. Song has been actively raising funds for finance in recent days. Although the issue of funding the Red Army suppression is more difficult, Mr. Song has repeatedly stated that he is also planning for it. Therefore, rumors of passive resignation, etc., are not true. According to relevant sources, the difficulty of the central government's finances is an undeniable fact. Those in power at this time should embrace the spirit of shared hardship, work hard, and strive for a way out in the thorny journey. There is no such thing as passivity or activity. If someone else takes over, no one would be unwilling to unload their responsibilities early.</p>

<p>Since returning from Europe, Finance Minister Song Ziwen has greatly streamlined the national salt tax. It is reported that in the past two months, revenue has shown improvement, approximately eight million yuan per month. It is understood that Mr. Song is now revising the salt tax rates in various regions, slightly increasing the rates in areas with lighter salt tax and slightly reducing the rates in areas with heavier salt tax, striving to gradually balance the national salt tax. At the same time, he is trying to facilitate transportation as much as possible, so that future salt tax revenue can gradually increase.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Newly Appointed Envoy to Mexico Huang Yunsu Will Soon Set Sail, Departing Tomorrow Morning at Three O'Clock on the McKinley <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Newly appointed Envoy to Mexico Huang Yunsu, after receiving his appointment, immediately prepared to go to Mexico to take office. He visited important figures in Nanjing and Lushan, including Wang and Jiang, to request diplomatic instructions. He is scheduled to set sail on the President McKinley at three o'clock tomorrow morning (the 28th). Envoy Huang Yunsu is from Taishan County, Guangdong Province. He studied in the United States in his youth. Because he hated the corrupt politics of the Manchu Qing Dynasty, he and his comrades, including Li Shinan, founded the Young China Society to conduct innovative research on domestic politics. The Young China Society was later reorganized into the American Tongmenghui, and Envoy Huang joined at that time, founding the Chinese Youth Morning Post to promote revolution and awaken the patriotism of overseas Chinese in the Americas. Later, when Premier Sun arrived in the United States, he and Premier Sun went to various ports to raise funds to assist the revolution. He contributed greatly to the Wuchang Uprising in 1911. After that, he returned to China with Premier Sun. With the establishment of the Provisional Government of Nanjing, he was appointed as the Guangdong Envoy of Comfort. When the government moved north, Envoy Huang, being young, was unwilling to enter the official career prematurely. The Labor Bureau deeply appreciated his ambition and sent him to study in the United States, where he entered George Washington and Columbia Universities, devoting himself to the study of political economy, earning master's and bachelor's degrees. After returning to China, he successively served as secretary of the Grand Marshal's Office, member of the Guangdong Education Committee, member of the General Headquarters Ordnance Committee, director of the Guangzhou Finance Bureau. After the cooperation between Ning and Han, he served as a counselor of the National Government, secretary of the National Government, and standing committee member of the Financial Design Committee of the Ministry of Finance. He was then appointed as Consul to Honolulu, and transferred to Consul General in San Francisco. After several years, he was ordered to return to China, traveling to Europe and the United States to investigate the situation of diplomacy, politics, and economy. Envoy Huang is very familiar with American diplomacy and the situation of overseas Chinese. He is very happy to be appointed to Mexico this time. It is reported that Envoy Huang is particularly concerned about the current situation of overseas Chinese in Mexico and will follow the government's instructions and solicit opinions from all parties to work hard for the friendship between China and Mexico and to seek happiness for the overseas Chinese.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Wanxian Suddenly Reports Bandit Alarms, Sichuan Guild Stops Handling Shanghai Goods, Foreign Ships Still Operate, but Freight Rates Slightly Increase <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>This time, the Red Bandits disturbed Sichuan, first clashing with Liu Cunhou's troops near Xuanhan in the Qiaowan River, Jiangdu River, and Shuangmiaochang area, and then advanced to Luojiangkou near Suicheng, the situation is tense. Reinforcements from all directions are gathering in Qixia, Kai County, and are scheduled to launch a general offensive against Xuan and Sui on the 28th and 29th of this month. The bandit army invading Xuan and Sui is now advancing from Guang'an Shunning across the Jialing River to attack Wanxian, resulting in a sudden tightening of the situation in Wanxian. People have already begun to flee downstream. Various public organizations in Wanxian have telegraphed Liu Xiang for emergency help and requested troops to defend the city to protect the commercial port.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Sichuan Ships Requisitioned <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Upon receiving the report, Liu Xiang believed that Wanxian was an important commercial port in the lower reaches of the Sichuan River and a necessary stop for ships on the upper Yangtze River, so it must be fully defended. Therefore, he immediately transferred 7,000 troops from Chongqing to Wanxian by waterway. However, due to the urgency of the military situation, there was no time to delay, so he requisitioned ships on the upper reaches of the Sichuan River specifically for transport. Six Chinese merchant ships on the Chongqing-Yichang line have all been requisitioned to transport troops, so that, except for Minsheng, all other Chinese ships between Yichang, Wanxian, and Chongqing are supplying troop transport.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Goods Halted <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Most of the goods shipped from Shanghai to Wanxian are textiles, cotton yarn, sugar, and sundry goods. At this time, the river water has not yet sharply receded, and the customer gangs are rushing to ship. However, due to the sudden bandit scare, in order to avoid danger and maintain capital, an urgent telegram was sent to Shanghai, ordering the Sichuan gang merchants in Shanghai to immediately stop handling goods bound for Wanxian. Those that have been handled but not yet loaded should be stopped from shipping as soon as possible. Those that have already been shipped and are en route should be unloaded in Hankou. The Sichuan gang merchants in Shanghai have all complied with the telegram and stopped handling goods.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Foreign Ships Operate <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>A certain gentleman in charge of the Jiejiang Company told reporters yesterday that because Wanxian is tense due to the bandit alarm, there are no more Shanghai goods, and Chinese merchant ships on the Sichuan River are mostly for military use. However, foreign merchant ships can still sail because they have the protection of their respective national warships. Therefore, the upper Yangtze River ships of Jiejiang (American), Taikoo (British), and Nissin (Japanese) can still operate. However, the freight for goods loaded from Shanghai to the upper Yangtze River will increase by about one-tenth. However, this is not because Wanxian is tense and there are no Chinese ships, but because rates are usually slightly higher during the shallow water season. As for the situation in Wanxian, it is indeed extremely tense. The large army transferred from the upper reaches has arrived, or it can be hoped that nothing will happen. However, commercial transportation has been interrupted, and the market will inevitably be affected.</p>

<p>The Municipal Party Headquarters, believing that the Red Bandits are entrenched in the mountains and forests of Jiangxi, Fujian, Hunan, and Hubei, resembling roaming bandits, and that the frontline soldiers are making efforts to suppress them with great success, so that complete suppression can be expected, the department telegraphed to the front to express condolences and encouragement. The original text read: "To Chairman Jiang in Nanchang and all frontline soldiers: The Red Bandits have plagued Jiangxi, Hunan, and Hubei for several years, poisoning the atmosphere, turning houses into ruins, and committing rape, plunder, and murder, which is absolutely inhuman. They dare to take advantage of the national army's resistance against Japan, seizing the opportunity to create chaos and harming the rear, which is a heinous crime, condemned by both humans and gods. However, the Red Bandits are entrenched in the mountains and forests, relying on dangerous terrain, fleeing here and there, resembling roaming bandits. It is difficult to eliminate them after several years of hard work. At this time of Pacific crisis and drastic changes in the international situation, if the bandit scourge is not eliminated and the foundation of the country is stabilized, how can we cope with this extraordinary situation? Fortunately, our Chairman Jiang does not avoid hardship and personally visits the bandit area, making plans and commanding with certainty, winning every battle, saving the compatriots of the four provinces from water and fire, and securing the nation and the people on a solid foundation. We are waiting for the final great success and establishing an unparalleled great cause. We are looking forward to it with admiration and are sending out the party members and the public to work hard and eliminate the communist work in the rear to support the front. We hereby telegraph our condolences and hope you will take note. The Executive Committee of the Shanghai Special Municipality of the Chinese Kuomintang bows and seals."</p>

<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, the case of eight rice merchants in this city, including Shenfeng, ordering 25,000 bags of old rice from Japan has been met with serious opposition from all sectors. The Miscellaneous Grain Industry Association sent personnel to investigate the truth and strictly ordered the merchants to cancel the contract quickly. The managers of the eight rice merchants then negotiated the cancellation procedures. At 4 p.m. the day before yesterday, a settlement was reached, with a compensation of 10,000 yuan for losses. The signed order was mutually returned and invalidated. The Miscellaneous Grain Association held an emergency meeting yesterday to report on the process and announce it to the industry. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e124">Cancellation Process <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>The eight rice merchants, including Shenfeng, received warnings from the Miscellaneous Grain, Oil Cake, and Industry Association, and were strictly ordered to cancel the contract with the foreign firm that purchased the rice as soon as possible. The managers of each firm met at Shenfeng Shop in Doushi Street at 1 p.m. the day before yesterday (the 24th) to discuss the procedures. It was initially said that Gu Xinyi of Yongda had not returned to Shanghai from attending a meeting in Jiangxi, and it was proposed to postpone the matter. However, more than half of the firms of the eight merchants rapidly proceeded with the matter in order to avoid unexpected events. They immediately appointed Wang Yintang, manager of Shenfeng Shop, Chen Ziyi, manager of Changfeng Shop, and Zhou Yuting, manager of Dafeng Shop, as plenipotentiary representatives to negotiate the cancellation with the American firm Handolai.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Cancellation Negotiation <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>The three appointed managers immediately prepared a letter on the same day (the 24th) at 3 p.m. and went to the American firm Handolai at 29 Sichuan Road to negotiate with Lin Bozao, the person in charge of the firm, but no result was achieved. After the representatives returned to their firms, they discussed the second step. On the next day (the 25th), they continued to negotiate with Lin Bozao. The foreign firm proposed to compensate one yuan per bag of the rice for the loss, totaling 24,866 yuan, before the order could be invalidated. The two sides negotiated for a long time. Until 4 p.m., the final result was that 10,000 yuan was determined as compensation. On the spot, the signed purchase orders were mutually returned and invalidated.</p>
<h3 id="e126">10,000 Yuan Compensation <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the American firm Handolai sent a letter to Gu Xinyi, manager of Yongda Shop, stating, "Dear Sir, We have received several bank drafts from your firm dated November 5, totaling 10,000 yuan. This payment is the compensation for the cancellation of 24,866 bags of Rangoon small broken white rice completed on the 9th of this month. The order is attached herewith for cancellation. Please also return the order issued by our firm as soon as possible. Sincerely, M. Heidlen, Yongda, Rencheng, Changyi, Dingtaide, Dafeng, Shenfeng, Changmao, Wanxingyu."</p>
<h3 id="e127">Order Invalidated <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>The full text of the order mutually signed by the eight rice merchants, including Shenfeng, and the American firm Handolai on the 9th of this month is in English. The translation is as follows: "The terms and conditions of the sale and purchase agreed upon by our firm (Handolai) and your firm (i.e., the eight merchants including Shenfeng) are as follows: Quality: All white rice, for small factories, old rice. Quantity: 25 pounds, 25,000 bags, with a tolerance of 5%. Shipping date: Within this month, to be shipped from Chinese or foreign warehouses. Price: 6.30 yuan per 200 pounds. Note: Other matters shall be handled in accordance with customs regulations." The said order has been mutually exchanged and invalidated.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Reply to the Association <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>The eight rice merchants, including Shenfeng, jointly replied to the Miscellaneous Grain Industry Association after the cancellation, stating, "Respectfully replying, We received your letter on October 23, instructing us to work together to cancel the 24,866 bags of small broken rice ordered this time with the foreign firm as soon as possible, otherwise the rice will be sold by the association in accordance with the previous resolution, the surplus will be used for charitable purposes, and the loss will be borne by us, etc. Previously, we received a similar warning from the Bean and Rice Industry Association. We have been negotiating with the foreign firm several times and have achieved results. We respectfully report the origin of this matter for your examination. The rice ordered by our firms from the American firm Handolai is small broken rice from Rangoon. As for where it comes from and on which ship it is loaded, it is the business of the foreign firm, and we have no way of knowing. If we knew that it was shipped from Shanghai by a Japanese ship, we would not dare to do this even if we were foolish. Moreover, privately importing Japanese goods is a kind of secret deal under the current circumstances. Even if we want to take this risk, we are afraid of not being careful enough to keep it secret. How can there be a reason to publicly allocate the rice to eight firms and accept the rice willingly? Just by this counter-evidence, the original intention of our firms to order foreign rice this time can be more than half understood. Only because Handolai was initially selling the rice, our firms believed that the dumping of this batch of goods in Shanghai would affect the market price when the new grain was coming into the market. Therefore, we agreed to purchase it equally to maintain the current rice price so that it would not be suppressed by the dumping of this foreign rice, which would harm the economy of farmers. We did not expect that this batch of foreign rice, according to the investigation of your investigators, was actually shipped from Shanghai by a Japanese ship. This is really unexpected by our firms and deeply regrettable. Before receiving your letter, we immediately canceled the contract with the foreign firm, and the loss fee of 10,000 yuan was agreed upon in the negotiations on the afternoon of October 25. We paid the money and signed the contract this morning, completely canceling the contract. All the orders have been mutually exchanged and invalidated. Our firms know that the rice is sold by your association, even if there is a loss, it will not be as much as 10,000 yuan, and we must voluntarily negotiate the cancellation to bear this huge loss, which is precisely to show the sincerity of our firms. The cancellation documents will be submitted for verification when your association holds a meeting. Special reply to the Shanghai Miscellaneous Grain, Oil Cake, and Industry Association, Yongda, Shenfeng, Rencheng, Changyi, Dingtaide, Dafeng, Changmao, Wanxingyu, etc."</p>

It is appropriate to record and announce this matter, and we respectfully hope that all fellow traders in the trade will take note. This is a special announcement.

<h3 id="e133">Hebei Finance Director Visited Finance Minister Song Yesterday Morning to Report the Province's Financial Difficulties and Request Mr. Song's Approval for Relief of the Contribution Payment <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Lu Muting, the Director of Finance of Hebei Province, under the order of Yu Xuezhong, the Chairman of the province, arrived in Shanghai from Peiping by train the day before yesterday to pay his respects to Finance Minister Song Ziwen, to report on the financial difficulties of the province and request approval for relief of the contribution payment. Mr. Lu went to Mr. Song's residence on Qiqi Road at 10:30 yesterday morning to pay his respects. A reporter from the Xin Xin News Agency specially visited Mr. Lu at his lodging in the afternoon, but Mr. Lu was out. Secretary Zhang Mujiang met with the reporter instead. According to him, the financial difficulties of Hebei were very detailed. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e134">Reduced Revenue <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Zhang first stated that Hebei's revenue decreased by more than ten million last year due to the abolition of the Likin tax. Later, when the war broke out, tax revenue in the war zone completely stopped. Although the war has now ended, twelve counties under the jurisdiction of Hebei Province have not fully recovered to their original state, and they have also been ordered to appropriately exempt land taxes in the war zone, resulting in a sharp decrease in revenue of more than one million. In addition, the areas affected by the Yellow River floods will have to reduce revenue by more than ten thousand, he said.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Increased Expenditure <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>As for expenditures, the monthly salary for the security forces alone requires 150,000, and the monthly salary for incorporating the troops of Li Jichun and others requires another 50,000 to 60,000. Including other expenses, the total monthly increase compared to before is more than 300,000.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Budget Deficit <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>According to the budget, the annual income is only over 19 million, while the annual expenditure is over 27 million. Now that income has decreased and expenditure has increased, and the annual increase in security force salaries is more than 3 million, the annual expenditure cannot be less than 30 million. Therefore, the deficit is more than ten million, he said.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Contribution Relief <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>The stipulated contribution to the central government is originally over 800,000 per month, but it has not been fully paid. The previous payment to the North China Financial Reorganization Committee was only 600,000 to 700,000, and after the abolition of the Likin tax, it was only 500,000 to 600,000. Now, all military expenses in North China are actually borne by Hebei. Now, the central government has ordered the Finance Department to allocate the contribution to the Finance Department of the Political Affairs Reorganization Committee on schedule, otherwise, they will be punished, or deducted from the military expenses. Therefore, under the order of Chairman Yu, he came to Shanghai to pay his respects to Finance Minister Song to report the actual difficulties and request approval for relief. After meeting with Finance Minister Song, he will return to the north tomorrow to report, he said.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Wang Kemin Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>

<h3 id="e143">Central Government Sends Li Renzhu to Shanghai to Investigate the Truth of the Electric Power Strike Fei Xindun and Du Yuesheng Negotiate Mediation The General Labor Union Issued a Call for Assistance Announcement Yesterday on Behalf of the Workers <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Dagong News Agency reported that since the Shanghai Electric Power Company strike broke out, the Municipal General Labor Union, considering the matter to be of great importance, telegraphed the Central Party Department's People's Movement Committee, requesting them to send personnel to Shanghai to jointly discuss and handle the matter with the Party and government as soon as possible. Now, the central government has sent Li Renzhu, the Director-General of the People's Movement Committee, to Shanghai yesterday to investigate the truth. The Municipal Council is negotiating solutions. The Municipal General Labor Union yesterday re-issued a call for assistance announcement for the power workers (see the advertisement column). The details are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e144">Central Government Sends Personnel to Shanghai <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>The Central People's Movement Committee, considering the Shanghai Electric Power strike to be a serious situation, previously telegraphed the local Party and government authorities, requesting them to mediate as soon as possible. Since the strike has not yet been resolved, the committee specially sent its Director-General, Li Renzhu, to Shanghai yesterday to investigate the truth in order to find a way to handle it. After arriving in Shanghai, Mr. Li went to the Municipal Party Department yesterday morning to meet with Tong Xingbai, a member of the Standing Committee, and Zhou Funong, the Director of the People's Movement Section. He inquired in detail about the cause and process of the strike. Later, the Municipal Party Department sent a cadre, Long Peiyun, to meet with Zhu Xuefan and Shao Xubai, members of the General Labor Union, at 3:00 PM yesterday. The two of them presented a detailed account of the handling process of the case, the current situation, the proof documents guaranteeing workers previously established by the Municipal Council, and the company's violation of promises and unwarranted dismissal of Chinese workers. They also summoned Xu Hongsheng, a representative of the Fourth District Water and Electricity Labor Union, to ask questions about the truth of the dispute in great detail. It is heard that Mr. Li still has important matters in Nanjing, so he returned to Nanjing last night to report to the central government first. He will still need to come to Shanghai tonight to continue the investigation. In addition, Bao Huaguo, the Fourth Section Chief of the Labor Department specially sent by the Ministry of Industry to Shanghai for investigation, has completed his work and took the Shanghai-Nanjing train yesterday afternoon to report back.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Fei and Du Negotiate Solutions <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Since the electric power strike broke out, various organizations in this city, considering the matter to be related to the safety of the entire society, have sent letters to the board of directors of the Municipal Council, requesting them to mediate as soon as possible. After receiving the letters, the Municipal Council sent the Western Director-General Pei'er to negotiate with the company's Taipan, Huo Pogensi, and sent letters to summon representatives of the four electric power workers to inquire about their attitudes in order to find a way to mediate. At 3:00 PM the day before yesterday, Director-General Fei Xindun invited Municipal Councilor Du Yuesheng to the bureau to negotiate solutions and decided to proceed with mediation immediately. In addition, Chinese Directors Yu Qiaqing and Yuan Ludeng also consulted with Director-General Pei'er on everything. Therefore, the Municipal Council has been quite active in handling the strike in fact. However, whether a solution can be obtained immediately depends on the sincerity and concessions of both parties.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Current Situation Inside the Two Factories <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>In order to understand the current situation inside the two factories since the power workers' strike has been going on for a long time, the Dagong News Agency reporter specially investigated various parties yesterday. It is reported that the new factory (power generation room) has a total of 30 electric furnaces, divided into four rooms. The number one furnace room has eight furnaces, and four are currently burning. The number two furnace room has eight furnaces, and all are currently burning. It is found that the furnaces in this room have not been fully lit since the May 30th incident. This time, they had to be fully lit to maintain the current because of the workers' strike. The number three furnace room has ten furnaces, and seven are currently burning. The remaining three are broken. Because no one is repairing them after the workers' strike, they cannot be used. The number four furnace room has four furnaces, and three are currently burning. One was dismantled before the strike, but it has not been repaired yet. Moreover, the furnaces are gradually damaged because they are burned every day without being repaired. The workshop has a total of fourteen generators. Generators number eight and nine could previously generate 20,000 watts each. Now, due to a lack of maintenance, the power generation has decreased to less than 10,000 watts. The other three coal hoisting cars are also slightly damaged. All projects for installing antennas and laying underground cables in the old factory are currently suspended. Although the company has hired more than 30 White Russians, it is of no avail.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Statement from the Go-Slow Committee <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>According to a statement issued by the Electric Power Company Employees' Go-Slow Committee, after the sudden assassination of employee Chen Qinglu, many outsiders suspect that it is related to the strike. In fact, Chen Qinglu was very sympathetic to the strike. When the Lianyi Society held a social conference at the Youth Propaganda Group on the 11th, Chen was elected as one of the go-slow committee members. Later, due to the limited number of places, Chen narrowly missed being elected. He then joined the picket team as a secret investigator and worked very hard. He was eventually forced to resume work due to pressure from his family (his sister had repeatedly gone to the society to argue with Chen). Now, the company's declaration that the victimized employee had repeatedly refused to join the strike before the incident is based on what? As for the fact that loyal and diligent employees were repeatedly subjected to violent pressure before the strike incident to force them to pay part of their wages for the strike, it is even more unfounded. In short, the company, in its imperial capitalist face, does not hesitate to use its despicable means and apply poisonous schemes to destroy the labor movement. This kind of trick only shows that its efforts are in vain.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Continued Report on the Strikes in the Three British-American Factories The Labor Side Again Petitions the Party and Government to Request Prompt Convocation of Mediation <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Since the workers of the Third British-American Tobacco Company went on go-slow, there has been no concrete solution for ten days. The Fourth District Cigarette Industry Labor Union yesterday petitioned the Party and government agencies again on the following matters:</p>
<h3 id="e149">Petition the Party and Government <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>At 6:00 yesterday morning, representatives of the Fourth District Cigarette Industry Labor Union, Zhou Xuexiang and Hu Menglin, first went to the Municipal Party Department to petition, requesting a prompt mediation. Zhang Sheng, the Director of the Guidance Section of the People's Training Section, received them and promised to find a way to resolve the matter in a short period of time. Later, they went to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, where Wang Gang received them and promised to report to the Director and consult with the Municipal Party Department on how to handle the matter. The petition is recorded as follows: The petition is for the matter of petitioning. The members of the British-American Tobacco Factory Branch Office affiliated to the association, in order to submit eight requirements, were not satisfied and have filed a case with your bureau since the go-slow movement began. Up to now, for ten days, the capital side's attitude has been tough, and there is still no concrete solution. If this continues, not only will the movement expand, but it will also affect the livelihoods of the workers. Therefore, Zhou Xuexiang and Hu Menglin are specially dispatched to lead more than ten worker representatives from the factory, including Dai Beichen, to come here. We respectfully request your review and approval, and promptly convene labor and capital parties to mediate, in order to resolve the dispute and benefit the livelihood. This is for the public good.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Labor Union Announcement <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>For the matter of announcement, since this factory refused the requirements of the capital side and a go-slow occurred, there has been no hope of a concrete solution for ten days. However, only by persevering and working hard can we find a way out. Therefore, all workers are specially notified that during the go-slow period, they must strictly abide by order, not be used by running dogs, and wait quietly for the mediation of the Party and government agencies. Be sure to tell each other. In addition, the Fifth District Cigarette Industry Labor Union issued a letter to the workers of the Third Factory yesterday, saying: Dear compatriots of the Third Factory, let us quickly unite. The British imperialist capitalists are using the same means to oppress you as they oppressed the workers of the first and second factories. The wounds of the first and second factories have not yet healed, and you are starting to fight again. Everyone is sacrificing for life, everyone is shouting for injustice, what we are seeking is liberation, what we are fighting for is hot blood. We have a fresh force of ten thousand, and we have the workers of the entire city as our backing. We must resist in unison, we must quickly unite. The workers of the Third Factory were organized in the 16th year of the Republic of China, but because the unity could not be consolidated, the factory destroyed them not long after. You now know the pain of not having a labor union, you know that only the labor union can protect the interests of the workers, so you would rather sacrifice everything to make the factory recognize your legitimate organization. Your self-awareness and self-help are enough to awaken the sympathy of the workers in the entire city, and your unyielding spirit is enough to strengthen the sense of responsibility for the unity of the workers in the British-American Tobacco factories across the country. We have a history of fighting together in the past. Under the strict barriers of imperialism, let us quickly unite. The factory has not yet implemented the Factory Law, the Municipal Government has not yet revised the management rules, the conditions for labor-capital mutual assistance have not been revised for the first and second factories, and the third factory has not yet implemented them. There are also obstacles to collecting membership fees, etc. We must continue the fighting spirit of the 16th year of the Republic of China, we must fight for the final victory, we must quickly unite.</p>
<h3 id="e151">After Dye Industry Workers Stopped Dyeing, Labor and Capital Negotiated Yesterday with No Results <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>The dispute between the labor side demanding the restoration of the old contract and the separation of liquor money in the silk, satin, and cotton cloth dyeing industry in this city has not yet been resolved after the suspension of dyeing passenger and freight goods. All parties are paying close attention to it. The capital side's fellow traders have organized a Business Reorganization Committee to deal with the go-slow incident. Yesterday, a joint meeting of labor and capital representatives was convened. Representatives of the labor side's silk and cotton cloth office, Tan Xirong, Wang Zishan, and Jin Aosheng, representatives of silk and satin, Shen Shuangxi, Wang Guoxiang, and Han Baoxian, and representatives of the capital side, Pan Jiaming, Fan Ruihua, and Sheng Xingqing, etc. attended. First, Pan Jiaming, a representative of the capital side, spoke, saying that your labor union's demand for the restoration of the liquor money in the old contract and the go-slow incident have occurred. If we persist in this for a long time and cannot resolve it, not only will our industry suffer a direct and great loss, but it will also have a great impact on the silk weaving industry. The silk weaving industry has been in a slump in recent years, reaching its peak. Moreover, at this time when the autumn season is the time to sell off accumulated debts, the dyeing industry's go-slow, the goods cannot be dyed, and the sales will be suddenly hit hard. The indirect losses in the meantime are even more unbearable than those of our industry. Now, the overall opinion of the capital side is to accommodate the guarantee of the restoration of the liquor money in your labor union, and one side will resume work immediately to reduce the losses of all parties. Tan Borong, a representative of the labor side, spoke, saying that our labor union's demand to restore the old contract treatment and separate the liquor money is the unanimous movement of all workers. We will not resume work for a day until we achieve our goal. Our determination is very firm, and there is no room for compromise. We hope that your side will sincerely accept and seek a one-time solution. As a result, the two sides could not get close. After the meeting, a representative of the capital side told visitors that he (self-proclaimed) did not want to participate in this unfortunate labor-capital dispute in our industry. However, he was forced by the public opinion of his fellow traders and could not refuse, so he reluctantly took on the task, hoping to seek a compromise between labor and capital on the principle of mutual benefit. Unexpectedly, the situation cannot be resolved in a short time. He plans to go to Peiping in a few days to avoid everything, etc. At the same time, the capital side's Business Reorganization Committee held its third representative meeting to discuss important cases to be dealt with.</p>

<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Xin Ming ship left Tianjin's Zizhu Forest this time, passed through Tanggu, and returned to Shanghai. In the Baihe River, it encountered low tide, causing it to run aground. It was found that the ship's draft was 11 feet 5 inches after loading, and the Baihe River's tide was only 10 feet, causing it to be blocked and run aground. However, the ship could get out of the shallows as soon as the tide rose, and there was no damage to the hull. The bureau received a telegram from the shipowner yesterday, stating that the ship could arrive in Shanghai this afternoon, only slightly delayed by a few hours of the journey. In addition, the Guangji ship of the Wenzhou route of the bureau encountered a strong wind on the way, but fortunately the shipowner took precautions in advance to avoid it, so the arrival in Wenzhou was slightly later than the original scheduled time.</p>

<p>Pudong Electric Company, with the order of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, contacted Zhabei Water and Electricity Company to receive electricity. The two companies signed an electricity supply contract in February of this year and agreed to first lay an underwater cable from the north of Wuquan Road, north of Jungong Road, east of the Bund in Zhabei, across the Huangpu River to Taojiazhai in the Gaohang District of Pudong. The cable has already been ordered from England and transported to Shanghai. They have already begun setting up signs marking the cable crossing to prevent ships from damaging it by dropping anchor. These signs will be installed before the cable is laid to warn passing ships.</p>
<p>After receiving notice from the Pudong Electric Company regarding the installation of the underwater cable across the river, the Municipal Public Works and Public Safety Bureaus jointly issued a notice, stating: "Notice is hereby given that the Pudong Electric Company has submitted a report stating that the company signed an electricity supply contract with the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company in February of this year, agreeing to first lay an underwater cable from the Bund north of Wuquan Road, north of Jungong Road, east of the Bund in Zhabei (approximately 1,130 meters south of the Qiujiang River Port), across the Huangpu River to the Pudong Electric Company's substation in Taojiazhai, Gaohang District, Pudong. The cable has already arrived from England, and construction is planned to begin in mid-October of this year. Warning signs in Chinese, 'Cable Crossing, No Anchoring,' and in English, 'Cable Arosing,' are being installed on both banks before the underground cables are laid and should be completed quickly. Fearing that ships traveling in the river will arbitrarily drop anchor in that area, damaging the cable and hindering the flow of electricity, a special report has been submitted requesting inspection, joint issuance of a notice, and strict prohibition of all ships from anchoring in that area. Otherwise, if the cable is damaged and power is cut off, the ship responsible will be held liable for all losses suffered by the company and will be severely punished to maintain public utilities, etc. An investigation reveals that if ships are allowed to drop anchor at will where this underwater cable is laid, the cable could easily be damaged. Therefore, it should be strictly prohibited to avoid causing malfunctions. All ships traveling in the Huangpu River must pay attention and must not anchor in that area. Violators will be severely punished without leniency once discovered. Let everyone be warned. This notice is issued by Wen Hong'en, Director of the Public Safety Bureau, and Xu Peihuang, Director of the Public Works Bureau."</p>

<p>The Shanghai British China General Omnibus Company, in order to prevent conductors from cheating, specially installed entry and exit mechanisms on routes 2, 5, 7, 10, and others. Passengers found it inconvenient to get on and off, and the conductors also found the procedures troublesome. Since the organization of the Conductors' Business Improvement Autonomous Association, they have been working hard to eliminate cheating. All conductors have signed pledges to join the association and no longer cheat. As a result, the company's business has recently improved significantly. The association then requested the company to address issues related to business improvement, with the removal of the mechanisms being the primary prerequisite. The association has now received the company's approval to remove the mechanisms from all route 10 buses starting tomorrow (the 28th). Passengers will find it more convenient from now on. Furthermore, in order to thoroughly eliminate cheating, the association has distributed leaflets asking members of the public to help monitor malfeasance in order to achieve complete success. The text is as follows: "To Whom It May Concern: Our association, recognizing the deeply rooted malpractices of conductors, which have been disdained by the public and discriminated against by the company, has specially organized the Conductors' Business Improvement Autonomous Association to rectify the situation, eliminate cheating, and strive to remedy past mistakes in order to enhance personal integrity, protect our jobs, and improve our treatment. The company has also expressed its support and has not only provided strong assistance in its establishment but also provided conductors with sufficient living wages. Although we have made some progress after three months of preparation, we still fear that some unscrupulous individuals may not abide by the agreement. Therefore, we are notifying all passengers again to help supervise. If any conductor is found to be cheating in the future, please report it immediately to the ticket inspector or send a letter to our association or the company. This is our sincere hope. Furthermore, the conductors' procedures are more complicated. In order to speed up ticket sales, we hope that all passengers will show the fare due immediately after boarding the bus so that the conductors can issue tickets immediately. We also hope that all passengers will check whether the ticket matches the fare paid. This is a notice from the Business Improvement Autonomous Association of the Shanghai China British Public Bus Company."</p>

<h3 id="e161">Pudong Residents Resolutely Oppose Moving the Xidu Wharf; Original Ferry Landing Is Allowed to Be Encroached and Merged by Asiatic Petroleum; Over a Hundred Residents Hold Farm Tools to Resist Work; - Yesterday, the Situation of Confrontation Between the Two Sides Was Serious - <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Works Bureau's recent relocation of the Xidu Wharf in Pudong and the allowing of the original ferry landing to be encroached and merged by the British Asiatic Petroleum Company has aroused strong opposition from local residents. However, the road to the old ferry landing has been blocked off by construction workers since the 24th, causing great alarm among the residents. On that day, more than 100 women from Chenjiazhai, Majiazhai, Taojiayan, and Yujia gathered nearby, each wielding long and short farm tools, to block the construction, preventing it from proceeding. For the past two days, they have continued to resist the workers, and the two sides have been in a stalemate, with the situation being quite serious. Yesterday, local citizens elected representatives Jia Jinfang, Pan Bosheng, and others to submit a report to the Pudong Native Place Association, requesting assistance and advocating for the benefit of transportation. The original text is recorded below:</p>
<p>"To Whom It May Concern: The Municipal Public Works Bureau is developing a municipal ferry plan and relocating the Xidu Wharf. We have repeatedly petitioned and forwarded requests to the Municipal Government to allow the preservation of the original road for the benefit of the people. We previously received a copy of the Shanghai Municipal Government's No. 1339 approval from your association, stating that there is still space next to the newly built Xidu pontoon wharf that can be used by the public and can also solve the water extraction problem, etc. After examining the meaning of the approval, it seems that the original road is to be abandoned, which is very alarming to us. Recently, we saw a joint notice issued by the Shanghai Municipal Public Works Bureau stating: 'Regarding the case of the Municipal Ferry moving the Xidu Wharf, Pudong citizens have stated that the elimination of the old wharf will cause some inconvenience for water extraction and unloading. They have requested that another wharf be opened to facilitate transportation. This Bureau has surveyed the area east of the Asiatic Petroleum wharf to the Hefeng Factory and found that there is no small road leading to it. It is not easy to open a new wharf. However, there is still vacant land next to the newly built ferry at Xidu. A request has been submitted to the Municipal Government for approval to allocate funds for this Public Works Bureau to build a public wharf for the public to extract water and unload goods. All citizens must not cause further disturbances to the Asiatic Petroleum Company's construction work at the old wharf at Xidu. In addition to setting up civil signs at the site of the public wharf to be built at the Xidu Wharf to clarify the boundaries and prepare for construction, this notice is hereby issued to make it known, etc.' We believe that the road that we have repeatedly requested to preserve for the convenience of transportation will soon be blocked off, and there is no way to appeal. We must once again appeal to your association (1). It is not easy to find a road leading to the wharf between the boundary of the Hefeng Factory and Asiatic Petroleum. This road should be ceded by Asiatic Petroleum. Moreover, there was an eight-foot-wide road before the Xipu Road. If the foreign merchant refuses to cede it, then they should not be allowed to encroach and merge the Xidu Wharf. Furthermore, there are precedents for municipal ferry wharves that are separated by roads and use pontoons for transportation, such as the Hongsheng Wharf of the Laiyi Ferry in Pudong, which is separated by the Duijiang Ferry Road, and the Gonghexing Wharf of the public ferry in Hongkou, the Public Concession, which is separated by Zhaofeng Road. Why should Asiatic Petroleum be allowed to be different? Moreover, the municipal government has long had a ban on allowing oil storage to be built, except for Gaoqiao Sand. The central area along the Pu River has long been banned. How can Asiatic Petroleum be allowed to expand again? (2) Since the Municipal Ferry Wharf has been built on Xipu Road, how can the wharf that the public is used to be demolished and taken away without leaving anything behind? After repeated efforts, a public announcement has been issued, stating that a public wharf for the public will be built later to satisfy the citizens. However, suddenly offering the Xidu Wharf to others for encroachment and obstruction does not conform to the eighth article of the National Construction Outline, which is to repair roads, develop transportation, and benefit the people, as taught by President Sun. We have grown up here and our interests are intertwined. For the sake of transportation and the prosperity of the municipality, it is difficult to remain silent. Therefore, we have prepared this document and submitted it to your association for review. We earnestly request your strong assistance and advocate for the preservation of the ferry landing and the benefit of transportation, which is indeed very inconvenient. Sincerely submitted."</p>
<h3 id="e162">Current Status of Radio in Our Country; Over Thirty Radio Stations Have Been Built in Various Provinces and Cities; Communication Has Been Established with the United States, Russia, France, the Netherlands, Germany, and Other Countries; Communication in the Border Provinces Is Currently Being Prepared <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Communications believes that radio has a wide range of uses, and in recent years, it has been expanding domestic radio station installations and international communication efforts without sparing any effort. The recent status of domestic and international radio communication is summarized below:</p>
<h3 id="e163">Survey of Domestic Radio Stations <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>The provinces that have established radio stations include: (Jiangsu) Shanghai, Nanjing, Chongming, Qidong; (Zhejiang) Hangzhou, Dinghai, Ningbo, Kanmen, Shenshan; (Jiangxi) Nanchang; (Henan) Zhengzhou, Luoyang; (Anhui) Wuhu, Anqing (now abolished); (Shandong) Jinan, Qingdao, Yantai, Weihaiwei; (Hubei) Hankou, Shashi, Yichang, Wuchang; (Hebei) Beiping, Tianjin; (Hunan) Changsha; (Yunnan) Kunming (can relay to all parts of Yunnan Province), Macau; (Sichuan) Chongqing, Chengdu, Wanxian, Xufu. These four stations can relay to all parts of Sichuan Province; (Guangdong and Guangxi) Guangzhou, Shantou, can relay to all parts of Guangdong and Guangxi Provinces; (Fujian) Fuzhou, Xiamen; (Guizhou) Guiyang (can relay to all parts of Guizhou Province).</p>
<h3 id="e164">Preparations in the Border Areas <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>As for the border provinces, such as Xinjiang, Tibet, and Qinghai, the only means of communication currently relied upon is military radio stations, and the equipment for commercial radio stations is still lacking. In order to complete the national radio route plan and develop the culture and commerce of the border regions, the Ministry of Communications recruited more than 20 telegraph operators willing to serve in the border regions and sent them off last month to prepare everything in Xinjiang. They have now arrived in Dihua, the provincial capital, but due to political disputes in the province, they have been unable to implement the original plan. Once the province returns to normal, formal communication can begin. Active preparations are also underway in Tibet and Qinghai, and communication should be realized in succession soon.</p>
<h3 id="e165">A Glimpse of International Communication <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Communications believes that international radio communication has a close relationship with the increase in understanding and friendship between countries and the development of commerce. Therefore, it has actively pursued communication with various countries. Formal communication has now been established with the United States, Russia, France, the Netherlands, and Germany. As for the planned Sino-American communication, the construction of new telegraph stations, antenna towers, and other projects in Zhenru has been completed in succession. Two transmitters ordered from England have been shipped to Shanghai, one of which has been installed and debugged. The other one can also arrive in Shanghai for installation this month. Therefore, formal communication can be implemented within this year.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Establishment of a Telecommunications Manufacturing Plant <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>It is reported that after the dissolution of the Telecommunications Manufacturing Plant by the Ministry of Communications, the supply of electrical materials for various provinces in the country is being manufactured by the Electrical Machinery Manufacturing Plant of the Construction Commission. However, all of its products are in short supply. The Ministry of Communications is now planning to establish a telecommunications manufacturing plant in Shanghai to remedy the situation. All plans have been completed, and it can be opened soon once funding is secured. On the one hand, in order to save expenses, it has specially purchased a generator from the Construction Committee, and is currently building houses in Zhengu to prepare for its installation. In the future, part of the electricity needed by the radio station will be supplied by the generator.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Newly Arrived Overseas Chinese in Shanghai Suspected of Being Communists; Public Safety Bureau Fails to Provide Evidence; Special Court Still Does Not Transfer Them; - Dispute Over Jurisdiction Arises - <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>Chen Yuxiu, Xie Xinming, Xu Jian, and Xie Zuoyu, overseas Chinese who arrived in Shanghai from Southeast Asia for business less than two months ago, were recently suspected of being communists by the Shanghai Municipal Public Safety Bureau. At 10:55 pm on the 18th of this month, police were led to No. 5, Continental New Village, Scott Road, to carry out the arrest. However, the Des Voeux Road Police Station detained the four men and sent them to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court because the area was under the jurisdiction of the Municipal Council. Because the Public Safety Bureau requested the transfer of the case but did not provide any evidence, the court ordered a postponement and instructed the Public Safety Bureau to submit evidence for further verification. The four defendants were each allowed to post a bail of 500 yuan, as previously reported in detail. Yesterday morning, Yu Hua, the chief of the criminal division of the Second High Court, along with two judges, Zhou and Jiang, opened a criminal court to continue the hearing. The police station was represented by lawyers Li Zhishan and Gan Jingchong, the Public Safety Bureau was represented by legal advisor Lawyer Zhan Jifeng, and the defendants were represented by Lawyer Yue Junfen. First, Judge Yu asked the defendants when they moved into Continental New Village. According to Chen Yuxiu's reply, the house originally belonged to a woman named Chen Liuxiang, who transferred it to us on September 1, and he presented a receipt for the transfer fee as proof. Next, the inspector of the Public Safety Bureau claimed that the four defendants were indeed communists and that the evidence was all in the Chinese area, so he requested permission to transfer them. Lawyer Zhan Jifeng proposed that the primary question in this case was whether the court had jurisdiction, because the defendants' place of residence was in the Chinese area and the construction of the house was licensed by the Municipal Public Works Bureau. Therefore, the jurisdictional question should be resolved. Lawyer Li Zhishan immediately stated that if the defendants were indeed communists, the police station would be happy to assist, but this case had been postponed for a week and there was still no evidence submitted. The names of the defendants were not included in the list submitted last time, and even today, they are still claiming it is a piece of order and have no other evidence. As for the jurisdictional question raised by the Public Safety Bureau, since this case has been accepted by this court, it is already under the jurisdiction of this court. The Criminal Procedure Law stipulates that the arrest of a criminal must be carried out with an arrest warrant issued by the court, stating the age, origin, and characteristics of the person being arrested. Today, the Public Safety Bureau has failed to provide this procedure and has no evidence to submit. Therefore, we request the court to rule that the transfer is not allowed. Lawyer Zhan replied that since the defendants' residence was in the Chinese area, the Public Safety Bureau could arrest them without notifying the police station. As for the arrest warrant issue, the police station often arrests criminals in the Chinese area without a court arrest warrant, and the Public Safety Bureau has always assisted them without objection. The police station's raising of this point is actually nitpicking. The defendants' lawyer then presented multiple letters from the Batavia General Chamber of Commerce and the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce to prove that the defendants were legitimate businessmen who had come to Shanghai to do business. Finally, Lawyer Li from the police station and Lawyer Zhan from the Public Safety Bureau argued for a long time over the jurisdiction and evidence issues. Lawyer Zhan solemnly declared that jurisdiction was the primary question in this case. Before this question could be resolved, he requested that the case be postponed for one week so that the Public Safety Bureau could gather evidence and submit a proposal. The court granted the request and ordered the case to be postponed for another hearing. The defendants were still released on the original bail.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Zhu Baoyuan's Death Leaves Behind a Huge Fortune, Causing Endless Family Turmoil; Zhu Ziyan, Qingshun, and Qing'ai Love Money More Than Flesh and Blood; After the Sisters' Lawsuit Was Settled, the Stepmother Sued the Court Again; - Not Afraid of Poverty, but Afraid of Unevenness; Poor Inheritance System - <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Zhenhe Tea Shop owner Zhu Baoyuan came from humble beginnings and became wealthy through business. His legacy of nearly three million was all in the hands of his two sons, Zhu Yanqing and Zhu Shunqing. However, these two brothers only cared about money and did not cherish their family. Even their biological sisters and their late father's stepmother were unwilling to give them a legal share, causing his two married sisters to feel resentful and file a lawsuit for division of property in the summer. Yanqing and others then hurriedly sought mediation, broke their stingy pockets slightly, and the lawsuit was settled. Unexpectedly, one wave had just subsided, and another wave arose. Now, his stepmother, Zhu Xinxinbao, is also suing the First Special District District Court, alleging that she has been deprived of property, etc. As the saying goes, "Not afraid of poverty, but afraid of unevenness." Zhu's two sons did not share their father's wealth with their family, which caused the litigation to be repeatedly initiated. Although it is due to the poor inheritance system, it is also due to improper handling. The story of Zhu's rise and the origin of this mother-son lawsuit are described below, based on the interviews:</p>
<h3 id="e169">Current Situation of the Zhu Family <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Zhu Baoyuan, a native of Haining, Zhejiang, died of illness at his residence in Shanghai on April 27 of this year. He left behind two sons, the eldest Yanqing and the second Shunqing, and three daughters, all born to his previous wife. He remarried Xi Xinbao, who is now only 33 years old and a native of Wuxian. She was married on December 16, 1930, and has not yet had any children. The three daughters born to his previous wife have already had two daughters married, but the youngest is still unmarried. Yanqing's brothers have all been married and have children. Shunqing also took a concubine, the famous prostitute Paper Tent Plum Blossom Lao Jiu. Later, his wife Mao died of typhoid fever, and Jiu was promoted to take charge of the kitchen. The Zhenhe Tea Shop opened by Baoyuan is located at No. 133, Lane 6, De'anli, North Shanxi Road. It has been a long time since its establishment. In addition to the tea shop, the types of inheritance are complicated, and the amount of property totals more than 2.7 million. It is not easy to achieve this result after starting from scratch.</p>
<h3 id="e170">From Poverty to Prosperity in Shanghai <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>Zhu's family was originally very poor. When Baoyuan was 15 or 16 years old, he was still a peddler in his hometown. He carried a basket all day long, walking back and forth on the streets, selling water chestnuts and fruits to make a living. One autumn tide season, wealthy merchants from Shanghai came to Haining to watch the tide. Baoyuan suddenly found a wallet at the tide-watching spot, which he thought was lost by a visitor. He sat there waiting for the owner to return it. After a while, the owner came and saw the wallet placed in his basket. Baoyuan offered it back without being asked. The guest offered him money, but he refused. The guest was so grateful that he brought him to Shanghai to find a job. Unexpectedly, after arriving in Shanghai, the person suddenly received an urgent telegram calling him back, so he left Baoyuan in a teahouse in Xiaobeimen. Deng You, the owner of the Pi Zou Yinji Wood Shop, visited the teahouse every three days to taste tea. He saw Baoyuan looking distressed, was surprised, and questioned him. After hearing the whole story, he not only pitied his drifting and helpless situation, but also admired his sincerity and integrity as a young man, and knew that he was not someone who would be content with his current circumstances. So, he took him home and introduced him to work in a small money shop nearby. This was the beginning of Baoyuan's entry into the business world. The money shop was near a tea shop. At that time, the tea shop had to rely on translators to communicate with foreign firms when selling tea. They were called "interpreters." The interpreter of the tea shop, surnamed Han, gradually became acquainted with Baoyuan because he admired his sincerity and appreciated his knowledge. In his spare time, he taught him English, and Baoyuan was also blessed with intelligence. Therefore, Han became more fond of him and listed him as a student. His career improved step by step. After several years, he used his savings to marry a woman from Huzhou. Yanqing's brothers and sisters were born to this woman. Soon after, he raised funds to open the Zhenhe Tea Shop, and from then on, everything went smoothly. In addition, he was good at socializing, so he was sure to win. He earned huge profits every year, and Zhenhe changed from a partnership to a sole proprietorship, which remains to this day.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Anecdotes from His Remarriage <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>After Baoyuan became wealthy, his desire for women arose spontaneously. Although he was naturally stingy and enjoyed eating leftovers, he had almost every request fulfilled for women. In the past, there was a prostitute named Bai Chongming Lao Er on Shantou Road who was greatly favored by Baoyuan. When she was mourning the death of her husband, Lao Er once asked to make a vow of lifelong commitment. Later, because his son Shunqing took Paper Tent Plum Blossom Lao Jiu as a concubine, and Er Jiu had some relationship, he parted with Er and hired Xi Xinbao as his successor. On the day of the wedding, Lao Er was deeply resentful of Baoyuan's betrayal and broke into the hall, causing a great wave of jealousy. Those who participated in the grand ceremony that day, even though it has been several years, still clap their hands and laugh when they mention the past, citing it as a rare and interesting drama.</p>
<h3 id="e172">The Sisters' Lawsuit <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Zhu Baoyuan's three daughters, born to his first wife, other than the youngest daughter who is still unmarried, the eldest daughter, Zhu Jun, is 31 years old and married to the Shi family. She lives at No. 33, Puyutang Street. The second daughter, Zhu Meizhen, is 21 years old and married to the Wang family. She now lives at No. 12, Shenyuli, Tiantong Road. The husbands of the two daughters are quite wealthy and self-sufficient. Therefore, after Baoyuan's death, they knew that according to current law, married daughters still have the right to inherit their parents' property. Out of consideration for their siblings' feelings, they did not want to immediately dispute with their two brothers. However, they saw Yanqing and Shunqing colluding with each other, intending to swallow all of the 2.7 million inheritance. They resented their arrogance and excessive deception, so they jointly filed a lawsuit for division of property as a warning to promote their awakening. Yanqing's brothers knew that they were in the wrong and feared that they would fail if the law was used to judge them. Therefore, they tried to mediate in every possible way. The two sisters believed that they seemed to have repented, so they did not go too far. They abandoned their inheritance rights, accepted the mediator's proposal, each received 80,000 yuan, and submitted a statement to withdraw the lawsuit. Therefore, the case was only heard in court once and then there was no news.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Mother and Son Lawsuit Opens Again <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>The late Zhu Baoyuan's second wife, Xi Xinbao, a native of Dongting Mountain, although childless after marrying Baoyuan, treated his two sons and three daughters from his first marriage as her own. Now, because the two sons, Yanjing and Shunqing, did not legally distribute all of the inheritance, she has retained lawyer Chen Ying to file a lawsuit, stating that, according to Article 1138, Paragraph 1, and Article 1144, Paragraph 1 of the Inheritance Section of the Civil Code, it should be divided equally into six shares (referring to Zhu's two sons, three daughters, and the plaintiff). The two married daughters have voluntarily relinquished their rights, settling for 80,000 yuan each. The defendants, seeing the successful employment of the "bitter meat stratagem", in an instant, have gained an undue benefit of over 700,000 yuan. They consider this the only surefire way to make an unearned profit, while completely disregarding the unmarried younger sister and the widowed stepmother, placing them in a state of neglect. The brothers competed for the estate with public accusations in the newspapers, but it eventually died down, followed by a secret agreement for division, the circumstances of which are difficult to describe. The plaintiff believes that the true state of the inheritance should be made public, and all important account books, land deeds, property deeds, various stocks, public bonds, and other valuable securities owned by her late husband during his lifetime are kept by the defendants in the tea shop. After her lawyer sent a letter requesting access to them, they ignored it, repeatedly offering reconciliation as a delaying tactic. First, they offered 120,000 yuan, then 200,000 yuan, but consistently refused to hand over the account books, with the intention of using the delay to fabricate or tamper with evidence, or to destroy evidence in order to conceal or alter the existing inheritance. It is now rumored that a portion of the inheritance has already been stolen and sold. The share of the unmarried minor daughter could have been claimed by the plaintiff in her capacity as guardian or stepmother. However, to demonstrate her transparency, she is only defending herself, leaving others to take their own course and not wanting to interfere and cause further disputes. Out of the existing 2.7 million yuan, after deducting 80,000 yuan for each of the married daughters, there remains over 2.54 million yuan. If the plaintiff, two sons, and one daughter divide this equally, the plaintiff should receive over 635,000 yuan. She respectfully requests the court to promptly order the defendants to pay this amount to protect her legal rights and private property.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Application for Litigation Aid <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>After the plaintiff, Zhu Xi Xinbao, filed the lawsuit, the litigation costs, based on the subject matter, were approximately 3,120 yuan. As she has been living in difficult circumstances since her husband's death, she is unable to afford such a large sum. Therefore, her representative lawyer, Chen Ying, applied for litigation aid according to Article 107 of the Civil Procedure Law. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Qiao Wanxuan of the First Special Court held a hearing on this matter. Lawyer Chen Ying stated the reasons why the plaintiff was unable to raise the litigation costs and requested a temporary exemption. If a guarantor was needed, he could provide one. However, the defendant's lawyer expressed opposition, saying that the plaintiff had private savings and was not impoverished. Lawyer Chen responded that the decision to grant litigation aid was up to the judge and could not be objected to by the opposing party. After debate between the two lawyers, Judge Qiao ordered the plaintiff to provide a guarantee according to regulations and await a decision.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Two Doctors, Absurdly Promising a Cure and Causing a Death; Yao Hongsheng Died from Excessive Bleeding After Surgery; the Two Doctors Fled in Fear of Punishment After Causing the Tragedy <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>Yao Ye Shi, an old woman from Shaoxing, residing in a rented room at 210 Xin Xin Li, Jin Shenfu Road, French Concession, is 62 years old. She works as an "amah" (nursemaid) in Western households. Her son, Yao Hongsheng, is 33 years old and works as a clerk at the Eastern Huili Bank on the Bund. His first wife has passed away, and he has two sons and a second wife, Wan, from his hometown. In May of this year, Yao Hongsheng suddenly suffered from stomach pains. He consulted Dr. Niu Huilin, who cured the stomach ailment, but then a lump appeared on his left shoulder blade, causing redness and extreme pain. He consulted both Chinese and Western doctors without success. As time went on, the lump gradually swelled, becoming as large as a bowl, with internal ulceration but no pus. In Chinese surgical terms, this condition is called "Shang Da Shou," also known as a type of "Zheng." A few days ago, a neighbor, Hu Zuoquan, who works as a chief clerk, introduced him to two Western doctors from the Xin Xin Hospital at 66 Xin Xin Li, near his residence: Xu Hongbin and Zhu Xianchu, both from Haimen. They agreed on a medical fee of 50 yuan, with half paid in advance. Doctors Xu and Zhu jointly issued a guarantee, promising a full recovery within 40 days. The guarantee also stipulated that after recovery, in addition to paying the remaining half of the medical fee, a commemorative plaque would be presented. After completing these formalities, the doctors ordered Yao Hongsheng to return home, where the doctors would come to his house for daily treatment. On the 25th, at around 10 a.m., Doctors Xu and Zhu brought a surgical kit to Yao's house, ordering Hongsheng to lie face down on the bed, where they performed surgery to cut and treat the affected area. Unexpectedly, Hongsheng had been suffering from the illness for a long time, and his body was extremely weak. Due to excessive bleeding after the surgery, he became delirious and was on the verge of death. The two doctors were frightened by the situation, realizing their lack of medical expertise and experience had caused the tragedy. They ordered his family to hire someone to take Hongsheng to Guangci Hospital for treatment, while the two doctors went to Guangci Hospital to make arrangements. However, before Hongsheng could be treated after being carried to the entrance of Guangci Hospital, he breathed his last and died. His family immediately sought out the two doctors, Xu and Zhu, for an explanation. However, the two doctors had already fled out of guilt. The deceased's mother then had the body transported back home and reported the incident to the French police station for investigation. The police chief sent detectives to Xin Xin Hospital, but Doctors Xu and Zhu had already fled and could not be arrested. Yesterday morning, the police station reported to the Second Special District Court, which appointed Prosecutor Wang Ren, along with a forensic doctor and clerk, to inspect Yao's home. Due to insufficient lighting in the house and unclear external examination of the affected area of the body, an autopsy was required. The body was then sent to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Autopsy Center. At 2:30 p.m., Prosecutor Wang, accompanied by forensic doctors Wei and Jiang, arrived at the center and performed an autopsy on the affected area of the body. The judge then took the bench and questioned the deceased's mother, wife, and the introducer, Hu Zuoquan. It was ruled that Yao Hongsheng died from excessive bleeding after surgery for a soft tissue tumor. The body was released to the family, Yao Ye Shi, etc., for burial. The doctors who performed the surgery, Xu Hongbin, etc., were deemed to have been negligent in their duties and should be investigated and dealt with by the police department. After the autopsy, the police prepared a coffin for the body and launched a search for the two doctors who had fled, to bring them to justice for interrogation.</p>

<p>The Weihaiwei National Goods Exhibition, led by Commissioner Xu Zushan of the Administrative Office, sent representatives to Shanghai to invite the Shanghai National Goods Touring Group to participate.

<p>According to the Shanghai Times, American Lieutenant Hall was apprehended by American consular officials in Tianjin last Thursday and is currently detained in the American Consulate's prison in Tianjin awaiting trial. American prosecutor Saler has flown to Tianjin by plane on Tuesday morning to investigate. Hall is a well-known aviator who participated in the European War and served as an aviation instructor for the Guangdong government. He is accused by General He Zhuguo of defrauding him of 9,775 yuan. General He Zhuguo ordered a batch of pistols from Hall, and after Hall received the payment, he did not deliver the pistols and boarded a ship to Japan. Upon arrival in Japan, due to a wanted notice issued by the American Consul General in Tianjin, he was not allowed to land and was sent back to Tanggu on the same ship. It is currently unknown how the American prosecutor will proceed with this case. It is estimated that if a criminal case is established, American Minister Prentiss will go to Tianjin for a preliminary hearing.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Further Hearing in Qian Shaofeng's Father Revenge Case <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>He Zunfu, a 35-year-old man from Guizhou, previously served in the military and political circles. Recently unemployed, he came to Shanghai with his servant, Tian Guixiang, in August, and stayed in Room 33 of the Datong Apartment in the Daodeli, Beile Road, French Concession. On the evening of the 16th of this month, He and his friend, Li Yanyan, went to see a movie at the Golden Grand Theatre in the Eight Immortals Bridge. At around 10 p.m., he was suddenly stabbed in the abdomen by a knife in the theater. The assailant fled to the entrance and was captured. After interrogation by the police, the assailant confessed his name as Qian Shaofeng, styled Peigao, 20 years old, from Guizhou, and stated that he was taking revenge for his father. The police immediately sent He to Renji Hospital for treatment and escorted Qian to the Second Special District Court for questioning and detention, pending He's recovery. Later, He died due to his injuries. The body was reported to the court, which sent personnel to verify it. His servant telegraphed He Rong, the deceased's son who was studying at the Nanjing Military Academy, to come to Shanghai to arrange for burial. This was reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday morning, Judge Wang Gangxu of the criminal court convened witnesses and ordered the defendant to be brought to court for further hearing in the Criminal Court No. 1. The police lawyer stated that the victim in this case had died due to his injuries, and the police were changing the charge against the defendant to premeditated murder under Article 284, Paragraph 1, Clause 1 of the Criminal Code, and requested that the defendant be tried accordingly. During questioning, the defendant Qian Shaofeng stated: "In the early spring of 1929, as I was about to get married, He Zunfu, the magistrate of An'nan County, Guizhou, unreasonably extorted my father, Qian Bin, forcing him to borrow 1,000 taels of silver and 400 taels of opium. My father had served in various positions, including the Finance Bureau, the Militia Bureau, the Educational Bureau, and as a primary school principal. He had always been honest and had no assets, so he refused to comply. He then held a grudge and colluded with Zhou Haitao, the company commander stationed in the county, who led a team on the night of the 5th day of the third lunar month of that year to arrest my father. The next morning, he was executed by shooting for "various unlawful acts and defiance of orders." Under their evil influence, I had no way to file a lawsuit. After my marriage, I vowed to take revenge. I tearfully said goodbye to my elderly mother and wife and went to Wuhan to study. Due to a flood, I transferred to Sanmin School in Nanjing. After the September 18th Incident, I joined the school's volunteer army. After going north, I entered Datong University in Beiping. Later, I received a letter from home stating that my hometown had suffered years of famine and was unable to provide tuition fees. I came to Shanghai in January of last year and entered the China Wireless Electric Engineering School. After graduation, I never stopped thinking about avenging my father's death. Earlier this month, I met He near the Datong Apartment on Edward Road. Seeing him enter the Datong Apartment, I learned that He had been living in the apartment for a long time. I then purchased a sharp weapon and waited for an opportunity. On the night of the 16th, I saw He go out and followed him. Seeing him enter the movie theater, I did not buy a ticket to enter and sat in the back row close to He, waiting for a chance to strike and wound my enemy. I stabbed him several times. I cannot remember how many times because I was in a state of mental confusion." When asked how he knew He Zunfu was his enemy, Qian replied, "After my father's death, He sent someone to notify us, telling us not to publicize the matter, otherwise it would be detrimental to my entire family. Everyone in my hometown knows about this." At this point, as the victim's son had not arrived, the official questioned the witnesses Li Yanyan and the two police officers who arrested Qian about the situation at the time. The official then ordered a letter to be sent to the An'nan County government in Guizhou to investigate the case and set a date for further hearing.</p>

<h3 id="e186">Daring to Steal and Sell Part of a Rented Shipyard Building - Zhang Jianfei Sues Fang Jianan and Others <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>The Inland Merchants Shipping Bureau under the Construction Department of the Zhejiang Provincial Government leased the entire bureau to Zhang Jianfei for business operations in June of the year before last. Subsequently, Zhang subleased a portion to Fang Jianan, Zhuo Binghou, Zhuo Ruibo, and other brokers at 230 Sichuan Road Securities and Goods Exchange, Dalongjin Company, for business operations, with a signed lease agreement stating that "all assets, bureau locations, and other buildings owned by the lessor will be transferred to the lessee for receipt and must be properly maintained." Zhang has now discovered that Fang and others have privately sold a building in Baota Bay, Yangzhou, to Feng Jinhai, and divided the proceeds among themselves. Zhang believes that after the lease expires, it must be returned to the Zhejiang Construction Department, and if any of the leased items are missing, it will be difficult to avoid responsibility. Therefore, after discovering this, he truthfully reported it to the Zhejiang Construction Department and received approval to quickly recover the property. Zhang then negotiated with Fang, Zhuo, and others, but no resolution was reached after a long time. He has now retained a lawyer to file a criminal self-accusation against Fang Jianan, Zhuo Binghou, Zhuo Ruibo, and others for conspiracy to sell public property, and filed a civil lawsuit requesting the court to order them to return the building. Judge Xiao of the First Special District Court held a hearing yesterday, but none of the defendants appeared. The plaintiff, Zhang Jianfei, stated the purpose of the lawsuit, saying that Zhuo Binghou had been working at the Yangzhou branch before he leased it from the Construction Department and had continued to do so until now. The house was sold in 1930, but the Construction Department was initially unaware. Therefore, the house was still listed in the lease agreement with me. It was only recently discovered by me, and the buyer has already rebuilt the old house into a new one. However, when my lease expires and I return it to the Construction Department, they must inspect the leased items according to the agreement. Therefore, I had no choice but to negotiate with the defendants. Since this incident occurred, Zhuo Binghou has fled. The Yangzhou branch is now managed by a person surnamed Zhang. Judge Xiao stated that the case still required investigation and ordered the plaintiff to await further review.</p>

<p>Sun Chufu, a native of Danyang residing at 20 Gujialong, in the city, opened Shunlongxing Beef Shop at 352 Qiwupu Road. His concubine, Chen, had a daughter named Guiqing, 15 years old, who was beautiful and worked at the Shenxin No. 7 Yarn Factory. Earlier this month, Sun returned to his hometown on business. A nephew of Sun's named Shuai Shuchun, also known as Amao (29 years old), who worked at the store, lured the girl to the Ping'an Hotel at 11 Pingliang Road for illicit sexual relations. Later, when Sun returned to Shanghai, he learned of the matter and became furious. He hid an extremely sharp beef knife on the morning of the 11th and, using the excuse of attending a prayer flower fair, lured Shuai Amao past the Qiwupu Road Wharf and stabbed him to death, throwing his body into the river in an attempt to cover up the crime. It is rumored that Sun also had improper relations with the girl, leading to this brutal act. The deceased was stabbed 21 times, and three fingers were cut off. He was arrested and brought before the First Special District Court for questioning. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xie Fen announced the verdict in the Third Court, sentencing Sun Chufu to life imprisonment and confiscating the murder weapon.</p>

<p>The Fourth District Public Security Bureau in Zhabei, received a tip the night before last that a robbery gang, which had previously robbed the Dafeng Yarn Factory of 2,000 yuan, was planning another robbery.

<h3 id="e206">Important Resolutions of the Vocational Education Design Committee of the Ministry of Education in Other Provinces (Part 2) <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>(A) Investigation (1) Provinces and Cities (Directly-administered Municipalities) (1) Matters to be investigated by the educational administrative organs of the provinces and cities: (a) The number of public and private junior and senior middle schools within the jurisdiction (including the number of primary schools within the city limits, etc.); (b) The number of students in public and private junior and senior middle schools within the jurisdiction (including actual numbers and the ratio with junior high school graduates); (c) The employment situation of graduates from public and private junior and senior middle schools within the jurisdiction in the past three years (the number of students entering higher education, the number of employed, and the number of unemployed should include actual numbers and percentages, as well as the percentages of various industries within the employed); (d) The types, number of students, and employment situation of vocational schools at all levels within the jurisdiction (same as item (c)); (e) The maximum amount of educational funds in this province or city that can be allocated to vocational education, and other methods of raising special funds for vocational education; (2) Matters to be investigated by the construction administrative organs of the province and city, the municipal social bureau, or other relevant administrative organs: (a) The types and number of well-known factories and stores within the jurisdiction, the number of employees, wages, and the knowledge and skills required for service; (b) The main raw materials and their quantities within the jurisdiction, and the ability to develop certain industries in the shortest possible time; (c) The current situation of inherent key handicraft industries and semi-mechanized industries within the jurisdiction, and the approximate number of workers; (d) The most important agricultural products within the jurisdiction and their total output; (2) Counties and Cities: (1) Matters to be investigated by the educational administrative organs of the counties and cities: (a) The situation of primary school graduates within the jurisdiction, and their family occupations and economic conditions (same as (A)(1)(c)); (b) The family occupations and economic conditions of junior high school students within the jurisdiction; (c) The employment situation of graduates from vocational schools at all levels within the jurisdiction (same as item (a)); (d) The maximum amount of educational funds in this county or city that can be allocated to vocational education, and other methods of raising special funds for vocational education; (2) Matters to be investigated by the construction administrative organs of the counties and cities: (a) The types of factories and stores and the most important handicrafts within the jurisdiction, as well as the number of workers, approximate wages, production and sales quantities, etc.; (b) The agricultural situation within the jurisdiction; (c) Whether there are any public or private agricultural experiment stations or new-style improved farms, etc., within the jurisdiction that have achieved results or have a good environment for development. The above investigation methods are a complete plan in preparation for the establishment of vocational schools at all levels in various regions in the future. The time required will necessarily be slightly longer. If various regions urgently want to open schools, they can first determine the types (rural, industrial, or commercial) and then conduct investigations based on the relevant items listed above within the planned scope, which will be simpler and faster. At the same time, educational administrative organs at all levels and relevant organs must still conduct detailed investigations at any time to prepare for the continuous establishment of vocational schools. The following three points should be noted: (1) The number of graduates of a certain type that can be accommodated by the original various industries in the local area at present and in the near future; (2) What kind of industries are currently being planned and built at present and in the near future, and the number of vocational graduates of a certain type required; (3) The number of interns that can be accommodated by local industrial institutions at present and in the near future. After the establishment standards are set, the subjects, levels, curriculum, and study period of all vocational schools in a region should be comprehensively regulated and should not be easily changed within a one-year period.</p>
<p>(B) Establishment: After the investigation results are obtained, the following points should be noted regarding the environment, equipment, funding, teachers, and students before establishing a school: (1) Environment: (1) The location of agricultural vocational schools should be in rural areas in principle. If it is unavoidable, it can be located in the suburbs with a rural environment; (2) More than 60% of the students enrolled in agricultural vocational schools at the primary level should be children of farmers; (3) The location of industrial vocational schools should be: (a) Where there are handicrafts or semi-mechanized industries that can be developed and improved locally; (b) Where there are handicrafts or semi-mechanized industries that are gradually declining and should be urgently improved and remedied; (c) Where there are no such industries but there are abundant raw materials that can be used to promote manufacturing; (d) Where there are factories that can be used for internships; (4) When recruiting new students for industrial vocational schools, priority should be given to recruiting children of workers or those who are willing to engage in this profession; (5) Commercial vocational schools should be established in large urban commercial areas first. Other ordinary counties and cities should first establish agricultural and industrial disciplines; (6) When recruiting students for commercial vocational schools, priority should be given to recruiting children of merchants or those who are willing to engage in commerce; (7) Vocational schools at all levels and in all disciplines should negotiate cooperation methods with relevant local organizations and groups, such as students being recommended by them, internships being borrowed from their facilities, and trial employment after graduation, etc.; (2) Funding and Equipment: (1) The funding for vocational schools at all levels, except for special expenses, should not be lower than that of equivalent schools for ordinary recurring expenses; (2) When preparing the education budget, education administrative organs at all levels should specifically list an item for vocational education funding, and consider the situation in various regions, stipulate proportions, and increase the amount and percentage of the total education funding year by year; (3) Vocational schools at all levels should not charge tuition fees in principle, and should try to exempt or reduce the fees for internship materials, etc.; (4) Vocational schools at all levels should have the minimum regulations for internship sites and work equipment, which should be stipulated and announced by education administrative organs at all levels based on the actual situation. In agricultural disciplines, the area of cultivated land and the types and number of new agricultural tools should be specified. In industrial disciplines, the area of the factory and the types and number of machines should be specified. In primary technical disciplines (typing, barbering, auto repair, etc.), the types and number of practice equipment should be specified. If it is not possible to purchase all of them, special agreements can be made with stores for rental or borrowing methods; (5) All income from farms and factories operated by vocational schools at all levels should be included in the budget; (3) Teachers: (1) Vocational teachers at all levels must have vocational knowledge, skills, and experience. The regulations for their appointment will be formulated separately by the Ministry of Education; (2) Vocational teachers at all levels should operate together with students as a service principle; (3) The salaries of vocational teachers at all levels should not be lower than those of teachers at equivalent schools. Those with special knowledge, skills, and experience should be appropriately increased; (4) Measures for teacher training in vocational schools will be formulated separately; (4) Students' Prospects: (1) When establishing vocational schools, it is necessary to identify handicrafts or simple mechanical industries that can be developed locally and do not require a lot of capital, so that students can engage in independent occupations after graduation; (2) Vocational schools should cooperate with local vocational institutions to prepare for the establishment of a certain business to train its staff; (3) Vocational schools must establish a career placement department and liaise with vocational guidance centers in the vicinity; (4) Vocational schools should liaise with local vocational circles so that students can be asked to try out their skills after graduation; (5) Vocational schools should conduct detailed investigations into the service performance and status of graduates and provide guidance for improvement at any time.</p>

When running vocational schools, the above four items should be considered and adopted based on the actual local conditions.</p>
<p>2. Practical Training Time: (1) The total amount of practical training time for students in various vocational schools should account for more than half of the total number of class hours in principle; (2) The daily practical training time for students should not be separated and should be at least four consecutive hours in principle; (3) The arrangement of student coursework should be based on the principle of attending classes in the morning and doing practical training in the afternoon. If it is due to the relationship of the practical training location, practical training may also be done in the morning; (4) The distribution of student practical training in each academic year should be based on the principle of learning before studying. For example, in the first few years, there is more practical training time and less class time, while in the later academic years, there is less practical training time and more class time; (5) The practical training time for agricultural subjects such as rice cultivation and sericulture may be appropriately changed.</p>
<p>3. Practical Training Divisions: Agricultural practical training should designate areas, industrial practical training should designate objects, commercial practical training should designate items, and household practical training should designate items or objects.

There must be a permanent organization to gradually seek the welfare of children. Therefore, the four bureaus of education, health, social affairs, and public security were jointly responsible for preparing and organizing the Shanghai Children's Welfare Committee, drafting simple rules, and submitting them to the municipal government for record in mid-May. In mid-June, in view of the difficulties faced by laborers in factories in raising children, the Committee also launched the organization of the Childcare Business Committee to prepare for childcare centers. By mid-August, in accordance with the regulations, enthusiastic children's organizations and experts were hired to serve as committee members, and the committee was formally established. It has been two months since then, and efforts have been made to carry out various causes. The recent work of the association is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Internal Organization: The association has one president, one chairman of the standing committee, six standing committee members, and one secretary. It also has five departments: the Children's Protection Department, the Children's Health Department, the Children's Research Department, and the Children's Business Department. Each department has one director and several committee members.</p>
<p>Responsible Personnel: President Wu Tiecheng, Chairman of the Standing Committee Pan Gongzhan, Standing Committee Members Li Tingan, Chen Heqin, Hu Shuyi, Wang Guanyi, Liu Wang Liming, Zhao Zengqi, Director of the Children's Protection Department, Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Director of the Children's Health Department, Director of the Municipal Health Bureau, Director of the Children's Research Department Chen Heqin, Director of the Children's Business Department, the China Child Welfare Association, Secretary Zhou Wanghe.</p>

<p>Xu Zhengji, Gu Zenghua, and others from the Jiangyin educational community in Shanghai believe that the decline of education in their hometown is due to the fact that it cannot be saved without generously raising education fees. They have successively telegraphed the Jiangsu Education Department and the Cheng County Government, proposing that the Education Bureau take over the assets of the Southeast Township Academy to allocate education fees. (According to the academy's annual income of more than 10,000 yuan, it is wasted.) Zhu Wenzhen, Cheng Wenyuan, and others from the educational community in the West Township of Shazhou in Shanghai also proposed that the bureau take over the Shazhou Academy and the West Township Office so that useful money can be used to do useful things to avoid the past being occupied by a few people.</p>

<p>(Nanjing, 26th) On the 26th, the seventh day of the National Health Examination, it was originally scheduled to end on the 27th, but because the various competitions could not be finished, it was extended for another three days. The re-examinations of various competitions have been completed, and the semi-finals and finals will be held afterwards. There were few spectators on the 26th morning, but there were many in the afternoon. A dispute occurred at the venue in the afternoon. During the boxing match between Hunan and Fujian, the Fujian athlete hit the Hunan athlete in the eye. According to the examination rules, the eye is a vital part, and touching it is considered a foul. The Hunan athlete then appealed to the referees, who forbade him to speak and ordered him to continue the competition. The Hunan athlete also punched the Fujian athlete in the face, and the Fujian athlete bled on the spot.</p>
<p>The referee immediately recognized that the Hunan athlete had fouled and revoked his qualification. A referee from Hunan then came out to interfere, and the two referees argued and twisted out of the examination venue. All the athletes from Hunan also withdrew from the venue in formation to show their overall forfeiture. According to Zhang Zhijiang, today's dispute was a misunderstanding between the two athletes. If they could have obeyed the referee's orders at that time, there would have been no dispute. After the Hunan team leader persuaded the Hunan athletes, they have calmed down and have agreed to take the examination.</p>

However, things did not go as planned, and they were urged to return by repeated telegrams from Southeast Asia. They departed on the Java Shipping Company's "Zhibade" ship sailing south yesterday morning.

It is heard that after returning to Southeast Asia, the two gentlemen plan to come north again around April next year to visit major domestic ports and meet with their elders and brothers in their motherland. Also on board were Mr. and Mrs. Ruan Kunli, newly appointed assistant at the Chinese Consulate in Penang, British Malaya, by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>

<h3 id="e246">Legend is the Enemy of Progress <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— Pei Yu</p>
<p>Near the greatest and most beautiful Niagara Falls in America, there is a power plant. On the wall of a generator room in the plant, there is an eye-catching and touching announcement. The announcement reads: "Legend is the enemy of progress."</p>
<p>If I were a young man, I would definitely copy the words on this announcement and hang them in my own study as a motto. Why? Because these few words answer a question that many ambitious young people often think about and often say: "What kind of opportunity can enable me to make a great and earth-shattering career in society and in the world? What is that opportunity?"</p>
<p>Even if there is a sound that exceeds the thunderous sound of that large power plant, the eight words on the announcement always clearly guarantee that various opportunities are waiting for you. Because the mere eight words contain an absolute guarantee that opportunities have never knocked on the doors of young people more loudly than they do now.</p>
<p>You may say: "What you said is certainly very reasonable. I wonder if you can provide some facts to prove it?"</p>
<p>Yes; I think I can.</p>
<p>First, the hub of our country's industry and commerce is now in the hands of a group of young leaders. We can almost see in newspapers and magazines every day that young people have become bank presidents, company managers, factory technicians, and so on. In other words, young people have become the driving force for progress. When I say the word "young people," I am not limited to people in leadership positions who are 20, 30, or some other clearly defined age. I use these two words in a broad sense.</p>
<p>What I mean is that they have novel ideas, far-sighted vision, solid skills, broad knowledge, firm perseverance, courageous spirit, diligent spirit, sound physique, pleasant state of mind, and they relentlessly and painstakingly explore the treasures before them. That is the true meaning of the two words "young people." This continuous and eager aspiration of young people, this indomitable perseverance, is indeed the driving force for the development of our country's current industry and commerce, and it is also a strong backing for the progress of all undertakings. If you do not believe the saying "Legend is the enemy of progress," and blindly stick to conventions, or superstitiously believe in fate, or hesitate and doubt, or shrink back, then you will never succeed and will greatly fail the opportunities at your door.</p>
<h3 id="e247">Fame and Fortune <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— Qifenglou Master</p>
<p>During the Qianlong era of the Qing Dynasty, there was abundant harvest and prosperity, and the world was at peace. Therefore, Emperor Gaozong (Qianlong), in a very leisurely mood, left the palace on a southern tour, traveling around the famous scenic spots of Jiangnan. One day, accompanied by a high monk, he went to the seaside to look out, only to see sails coming and going in the sea like weaving. Emperor Gaozong asked the monk, "How many ships are there in the sea?" The monk replied, "There are only two." Emperor Gaozong wondered, "How do you know?" The monk replied, "One is for 'fame' and the other is for 'fortune,' that's all." According to the current ships in the sea, I am afraid that in the near future, it will be reduced to only one, because people are all pursuing profit, and how many people are still asking for fame!</p>
<p>Some people say, "Fame" is virtual, and "fortune" is real. In fact, this statement is specious. You must know that "fame" and "fortune" are related, and seeking fortune with fame is the right way. Gaining profit by fraud and trickery is not only improper, but can only gain temporary benefits and will never last long. However, people nowadays only know how to pursue the present, and who cares about future failures.</p>
<p>As for gaining both fame and fortune, who does not hope for it? But before becoming famous, one should not have thoughts of profit in mind. One should always be conscientious and work hard, only moving forward on the right path to fame! To achieve knowing what others do not know, being able to do what others cannot do, and not caring about hardships and dangers. If so, I know that there will be a day of fame. When you have gained a good reputation, of course, people from all sides will come to seek you. At that time, you will not need to spend any more effort, and naturally fortune will come with fame.</p>

<p>— Xiang</p>
<p>(1) Picking Cotton</p>
<p>One by one, carrying bamboo baskets on their backs, old, young, male, female, some wearing straw hats, some with blue cloth wrapped around their heads...</p>
<p>In the morning, they run out of the village five li away, running alone, running in groups...</p>
<p>Running east, west, south, and north to all their cotton fields.</p>
<p>White, soft, clusters of cotton, soft and white cotton, they all bow their heads, carefully harvesting, and putting it into the basket on their backs. Clusters of soft and white cotton, already heated through, falling on the sand, they also bow their heads, gently pick it up, and put it into the basket on their backs in the same way.</p>
<p>From morning to night, from today to tomorrow, until all the cotton is picked, you can only see them carrying the empty baskets out and carrying them back full of cotton.</p>
<p>Although their bodies are very painful, their spirits may be very comforted. Their hearts are as pure as the cotton.</p>
<p>(2) Reaping Rice</p>
<p>The setting sun dyes the fields golden, and the dying autumn cicadas still chirp "zhiliao, zhiliao," chirping very sadly.</p>
<p>An elderly farmer happily carries the ripe rice on his shoulders from their field to the yard at home, showing his final victory.</p>
<p>Several young farmers hold sickles and keep cutting their rice, without resting for a moment.</p>
<p>Cutting, carrying, gradually turning the golden fields into ocher-black soil.</p>
<p>From sowing, transplanting seedlings, drawing water,... peacefully obtaining today's harvest, hoping for this year, hoping for next year,... as long as there are no natural disasters or man-made disasters,... their hard work will not be in vain.</p>
<p>(3) Threshing Rice</p>
<p>"Pata,... pata,"</p>
<p>A young couple sings a rural love song, and their hands beat the rice on the threshing floor against each other, making such a sound, as if clapping to their beat.</p>
<p>"Suoluo,... suoluo," this is the sound of the grain falling down.</p>
<p>Singing, threshing, and the sound of falling grain, a wonderful trio, is playing in this great nature.</p>
<p>The songs are sung continuously, the rice is threshed continuously,... they do not feel hard or tired, they are already intoxicated.</p>
<p>Roosters, hens, in groups of three or five, regardless of the owner's year-long expectations and hard work, secretly eat the grain on all sides, and their owner does not even notice, perhaps unwilling to disturb them.</p>
<p>Willing to let the chickens eat some of the grain exchanged for sweat, they are truly intoxicated.</p>
<p>Singing, threshing, and the sound of falling grain, this wonderful trio, is still playing in great nature.</p>
<h3 id="e249">Modern Opening <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>— Mei Xue</p>
<p>The opening piece is popular again for a while now, and it can often be seen in newspapers and radio broadcasts. However, very few of them are in the tone of the opening piece. The opening piece is a special work in Suzhou literature, and people from other provinces and counties cannot write it. When they do, it always has some awkward and strange tones. Poets will also not write it, because when they do, it tends to be more lyrical. Those who are not familiar with tones will not write it, because when they do, it is close to a beachy tone. Because of these three inabilities, good poems are often seen, but good opening pieces are extremely rare. Recently, in a certain book hall, I heard a modern opening piece that was quite amusing, and the tones were harmonious, the rhythm was appropriate, and the writing was between elegant and vulgar. It was indeed an outstanding and appropriate good opening piece. It is said that it was written by a certain gentleman, and this gentleman is a famous expert in opening pieces. Of course, he has works that meet the standards. It is a pity that my memory is weak, and I only remember the beginning part. It is written below: The golden wind and jade dew intersect in autumn, and the insects chirp sadly without stopping. It is not only the autumn insects that feel resentment, but even the modern girls also add to their sorrows. May I ask, what is causing the girls to feel sorrow and depression? They are not worried about food or clothing, but only hate that the autumn coolness makes it difficult to show off. Georgette and Indian silk are now useless and must be placed on the top floor; they can only reveal a touching affection, failing to show off the two fleshy buns on their chests... When singing to this point, the whole hall burst into laughter.</p>

<p>Chapter 17: Who Can Be Without Emotion? Home Thoughts Discourage Soldiers; Warfare Does Not Dislike Deception; Bold Words Strengthen Military Hearts</p>
<p>When Zhao Ziqiang saw them pushing the squad leader to ask for help, he couldn't refuse. He had to take out the money and give it to the squad leader to handle. The thirty yuan departure fee from the regimental headquarters was collected by the quartermaster at six o'clock yesterday afternoon. Until now, Zhao Ziqiang had not put the money in his pocket and kept it. When he roughly counted it, he had already spent a lot of it. Although Zhao Ziqiang felt very aggrieved, he couldn't say anything. With great difficulty, he got through this period, and the regimental headquarters had already called, urging him to collect the luggage carts. According to the rules, each company needs six carts, two small luggage carts for ammunition and four large luggage carts for office supplies, cooking utensils, and tents. However, this time, only four carts were called for collection. The regimental headquarters specified that these four carts should all carry large luggage. Two more carts for small luggage were still needed, and each battalion had to find a way to get them. It seems that it is not too difficult for the First Battalion and Fourth Company to find eight carts. However, the peasants near the barracks did not dare to prepare carts. Moreover, the news that the army was about to set off had already spread, and people with livestock quickly hid them. At this time, the First Battalion was short eight carts, each battalion was short eight carts, and the whole division was short more than a hundred carts. With only a few hours left, where could they find a way? Zhao Ziqiang ran back and forth between the company headquarters and the battalion headquarters for this problem. Their battalion commander, Bao Fang, was indeed an experienced officer, so he asked him: "Now that things have come to this, it's not a matter of grabbing at straws. Your home is in Haidian. If you go there yourself, you can definitely get two carts. If that doesn't work, you'll have to make do, find a few pack animals, find a few civilians. If you have to use compulsory measures, you'll have to use a little. Anyway, we'll return the livestock and civilians to them in the future, and our conscience will be clear." Zhao Ziqiang was sweating profusely, and he had not even thought of returning to Haidian. (224)</p>
<h3 id="e251">Miscellaneous Notes on the Post National Games <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>— Yin Qiu</p>
<p>—After the Second Performance of the 10,000-Meter Race—</p>
<p>In this grand National Games, the problem of Jin Zhongkang running one lap less in the 10,000-meter race unexpectedly occurred, which caused a lot of disputes. It cannot be said that it was not an unfortunate event for the Games! Although it was decided at that time to cancel Jin Zhongkang's first place, this problem still felt suspicious? Some people said, "The ranking of the 10,000-meter race is like arbitrarily pairing mandarin ducks"; others said, "The score of the 10,000-meter race is a muddled account." People who care about sports are all discussing it there.</p>
<p>Since the performance race of the 10,000 meters on the afternoon of the 19th, Jin Zhongkang eventually won the first place, but the result was slightly worse, and the time was two minutes slower than the last time; so, I heard a lot of comments again.</p>
<p>Some people said, "Jin Zhongkang's skills are extraordinary after all. He definitely did not run one lap less the first time. If he really ran one lap less, and his ability was to be after tenth place, how could he be so presumptuous? Boldly take the risk of re-performing? If he really lags behind one lap and is not as good as others, wouldn't he expose his ugliness and prove that he did run less, leaving endless shame? Jin Zhongkang would not be so foolish."</p>
<p>Another person said, "Jin Zhongkang's flaw is that the results of the two races differed by two minutes, failing to completely clear people's suspicion about running one lap less. This needs to be explained."</p>
<p>The former person said again, "There are several reasons for the difference of two minutes: First, the wind was strong that day, and it was very difficult to run to the East Commander's Platform, so everyone's results were poor. Second, everyone's results were not particularly outstanding, so Jin took maintaining the first place as the limit. Since no one competed fiercely with him, Jin had no opportunity to make rapid progress. Third, running two 10,000-meter races in the middle of just a few days requires a lot of strength. Now that the five athletes ran 20,000 meters each, the results should naturally be worse. Fourth, and further thinking, Jin Zhongkang may have caused people to suspect him because of his excellent results last time, so there was a saying that he ran one lap less; so this time, he deliberately relaxed, slowed down two minutes, and leisurely showed that he was still enough to overwhelm the others. Then, it is undoubtedly true that he accelerated in the initial race, quickly occupying the first place by two minutes!"</p>
<p>That person also said, "What you said is true, but thinking it over, Jin Zhongkang may have run one lap less in the initial race, and fortunately won the second performance, which was to save his reputation, so how could he not work hard? Therefore, it was easy to win; under hard work, although he won the first place, the result was still worse, isn't it still because of one lap?"</p>
<p>The former person explained again, "Jin Zhongkang's problem of running less started with the accusation of the Shanxi team after the official announcement of the first place; then, wouldn't the athletes of the Shanxi team, Gu Desheng and Wang Zhenglin, etc., also work together to maintain the previous record, or even exceed it, so that Jin Zhongkang could not win the championship? Then Jin's victory is not easy! And among the five participants, any one of the other four got the first place, and Jin was second, which shows how difficult it will be for Jin to win the first place? As a result, Jin won it, and Jin's strength can be known, so it can be proved that Jin's victory last time was accurate, and running less is a suspicion."</p>
<p>Each member is willing to participate in this kind of performance race, which is a representation of sportsmanship and is worthy of our admiration! It further proves that the responsibility for the 10,000-meter dispute does not lie with the athletes participating in the race, but should be borne by the referee committee; the confusion of the referee committee led to this unfortunate event. Fortunately, there are these athletes with great understanding of justice who performed a second time, and it should be called a gentleman's competition.</p>
<p>There is another layer. When it was decided to cancel Jin Zhongkang's first place, it was based on Li Wenchang's record of 19 laps. So, Huang Bobin was greatly blamed, and his depression can be known. His resentment and frustration were no less than Jin's cancellation of the victory. It was not until after the second performance that Jin's satisfaction could be known, and Huang could also relieve some of his depression!</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange was the last day for October futures. The market turbulence became more dangerous, people's hearts were chaotic, and the market was extremely weak. The selling by the financial circles continued unabated. Rumors were rampant in the market, and there was no consensus. The selling by large accounts was said to be to "remove the old and bring in the new," that is, to sell the original old goods and settle the short position. At the opening in the morning, because the report that Finance Minister Song had resigned was inaccurate, people's hearts were slightly calmed, and the atmosphere in the market improved. The initial opening for Issue 18 and Disbandment was slightly small, two or three jiao. Since the beginning of the troop reduction, the selling by large accounts has been slightly sparse, and short covering transactions have been booming. The market price rose higher and higher, rising by three or four jiao to eight or nine jiao, but the salt tax was only two or three jiao, and the gold standard was still slightly down by three jiao. The market atmosphere was still uncertain, because the salt tax sellers were still very enthusiastic. The second session opened at 2 PM. In advance, the market atmosphere became tense again, and people were panicked. After the opening, the falling trend was extremely fierce from beginning to end. Large accounts and financial circles continued to sell off, with several types falling by as much as one yuan three or four jiao. For a time, people were confused and felt quite miserable, but the salt tax falling trend was relatively flat. The afternoon opening was at 4:45 PM. The selling by large accounts became more booming, and Issues 11, 33, 47, and 50, etc., all had huge numbers sold. The strength was strong, and the market price became more unmanageable. The falling trend was still more fierce. The larger ones, such as Issue 20, fell by one yuan and five jiao, and the salt tax also fell by one yuan. The scale of the turbulence has not been seen in months. At the closing at 9 PM, the market price continued to fall by about one yuan, and then turned better by seven or eight jiao. In summary, the market price fell from half a yuan to one yuan and six or seven jiao. The total number of transactions was estimated to be about 25 to 26 million. Today, only November will be traded.</p>

"Cotton" The new gold price was quite disappointing, and the effectiveness of the monetary policy was also unpredictable, but speculators bought, and the public believed that the cotton price would still be high, probably due to speculative interest. As of the 18th of this month, the amount of ginned cotton was 8,600,000 bales. "Silver" The sentiment was still good, and the US Treasury gold price was $31.36 per ounce.

<p>The yarn market is still flat. Although a certain association buys every day, the number of people who echo and follow is as rare as morning stars. The association still bought about 7,000 to 8,000 bales this month, but arbitragers sold uniformly. The future situation is still lacking in certainty.</p>

<p>Guangdong 455 Xiamen 25 Yunnan 120 Sichuan 175 Fellow Traders 30</p>
<p>The cotton market is flat. The most popular October, which was being short squeezed, has passed steadily. Among them, 20,000 to 30,000 piculs were settled and delivered with a certain manufacturer. The qualified ones were about 50,000 to 60,000 piculs. Therefore, the market atmosphere passed flatly. However, the sales of spot cotton are still sluggish, and the yarn market is sluggish. Therefore, in terms of the general situation, it is still ordinary.</p>

<h3 id="e266">Overview of Global American Cotton Supply and Demand in the Last Quarter <a href="#e266" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c266" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">266</a></h3>
<p>– Consumption Is Higher Than Initially Expected –</p>
<p>According to a report from the New York Cotton Exchange News Agency, the world's cotton mills consumed more American cotton in the last quarter than initially estimated, about 273,000 bales more, that is, from 14,132,000 bales to 14,405,000 bales. The world's stock of American cotton at the end of July was 239,000 bales less than previously estimated, that is, from 11,975,000 bales to 11,705,000 bales. The reduction of 239,000 bales in the carryover offsets the increase of 980 bales in the government cotton production estimate, resulting in a decrease of 141,000 bales in the world's supply of American cotton this quarter. Therefore, the current supply is 24,066,000 bales, not 24,207,000 bales as previously estimated. The world's consumption of American cotton in the last quarter was 14,405,000 bales, the highest of any cotton season since 1928. In 1928-29, the world consumed 15,226,000 bales of American cotton. The carryover of 11,736,000 bales is above the recent average, but it is 1,452,000 bales less than last year. Last year's carryover was 12,228,000 bales.</p>
<h3 id="e267">Food Futures and Wheat Are Rising Step by Step <a href="#e267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, wheat flour rose by another eight or nine corners, and people's hearts were upward. Orders were not drawn, factories replenished this month, customers received the near term, and hoarded the far months. At the opening, the near and far each rose by about two points, especially the far months were popular. Then, the factory sold the near and far months, especially the far months were more. Fuxin alone threw out as much as 200,000, and other factories also sold, and the market fell by one or two points. However, Fuxin bought this month's standard flour in the afternoon, and this month is the end of the month for delivery, and it can be directly drawn out in cash, without the complexity of a contract period and price difference. Therefore, there was quite a lot of interest in retail sales. Speculators inside and outside the industry were afraid of being short squeezed again as before, and they also tried their best to replenish, so it immediately soared. The closing price this month was 3/25 larger, the next month was 2/25 larger, December was 1/75 larger, January was 2/25 larger, February was 1/2, and March was 75 larger.</p>
<p>After the continuous rise of wheat, it has aroused new purchases. Merchants did not sell, short covering, and this month is close to delivery. Most of the delivery spot wheat was received by factory households, and the shorts who had chips were not willing to deliver spot wheat due to the current activity of spot wheat. In addition, spot wheat has also been rising continuously recently, and people's hearts are particularly optimistic. After the opening, each month rose uniformly. In the afternoon, there was a scramble for short covering, and the market became even more tense. The closing price was October 7 points larger, November 8 points larger, December 4 points larger, January 6 points larger, February 5 points larger, and March 4 points larger. Spot wheat opened with Yangzhou wheat at 3 yuan 7 jiao, Bengbu 3 yuan 8 jiao, Wuxi 3 yuan 5 jiao, and Gaoyou 3 yuan 7 jiao. It is estimated that Futong went to 3,000 bales and Xinda 700 bales, and the price was 5 points larger than the previous day. However, the new Australian white wheat will be on the market in December. There was a sell-off yesterday, and the asking price was 4 yuan 6 jiao. Shanghai merchants have not yet counter-offered. This price is still too high, but the mutual concessions between the two sides are really close to possible.</p>
<h3 id="e268">Rice Market Is Difficult to Turn Around <a href="#e268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were more than 40 sources, totaling more than 5,000 stones. New goods of various colors such as kiln middle hundred brother accounted for more than 3,000 stones, Du Yang pointed a thousand hundreds of stones, and broken indica five or six hundred stones. Because it is a long-fatigued market, there is still a setback. In fact, the continuous influx of arrivals in the warehouse is also thick (a total of about 45,000 stones), so even if it sells 4,000 to 5,000 stones, it is still oversupplied. People's hearts are inclined to the low market, and the market is also slightly smaller. New indica such as white rice are especially inconsistent in the store market, with reductions of one or two corners. The arrival of Du Yang pointed is also strong, and the road is still wide. The eating market is looser, and the market situation has a slight fluctuation of a few points. New Bianyuan is flat.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, more than 30 ships arrived from various roads down the river. The market sales were deserted. The prices of new, broken, Yangbu, Du pointed, kiln species, Baiguo, Bo indica, white indica, Yin Yuan Ke pointed, etc., were flat and weak. The price of broken Yuan was small by two corners.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Ke Xian Ke Hu was stagnant again. Only Quanzhou Gang in the United City still had social interactions. Fuzhou only handled 100 bags of Xiang Po, and Quanzhou Gang's appetite was also weak. A total of about 600 bags were handled. The Guangdong gangs and the Zhejiang Road in this street unanimously stopped. The market was originally looking small, but the stagnant sales of the local product made it impossible to support, and the market immediately fell. Fortunately, there are not many arrivals recently, and the newly arrived Hunan rice is all limited in price and is not allowed to be sold cheaply. Although there are arrivals, it is still difficult to sell, so the market will not fall madly. Moreover, the Japanese merchants' 25,000 bags of small twisted yarn have been ordered by the guild to the fixed rice firms to cancel the contract, and there will be no more arrivals in the future, so Ke Xian cargo owners are watching the good again. Yesterday's sales of various rice were only three or five points smaller.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market showed a slight rise in customs gold and a reduction in Dutch exchange rates, offering some hope. However, actual sales remained stagnant, and the trend was still weak. The guild adjusted the price, and coarse sand white ordinary goods were quoted down another five cents, at $21.15, but no transactions were made. However, the market price seems to have stabilized at this point, and the future market is not expected to be too loose. Medium sand white sugar No. 20 was still quoted at $20.65, but no sales occurred. Dutch red NT mark was priced at $16.25, ordinary at $0.15, both down five cents from the previous day. Daegu Sugar B mark was also down five cents, at $21.25, and HX mark at $20.65. Chunghwa Chen Kee's factory cotton white all entered the $20 mark, No. 1 at $19.95, with the rest declining accordingly. More than a hundred bags of Chaoqing low-grade sugar were offered at a price of $14.80 to $14.60.</p>

<p>Recently, the sales of golden needles vegetables have recovered in Guangdong, Fujian and other regions, and the trend has gradually become active. In addition, the arrival of goods is scarce, and the inventory is not large, the market situation is more stable, and there is an expectation of rising prices. It is found that the goods in various stores, such as top-grade vegetables and low-grade Shaanxi vegetables, have been sold out. Dahsing vegetables were once offered at $16.70 and sold at $17. Others, such as the authentic top-grade vegetables, are out of stock, around $18.50, Yanghua vegetables at $16.50, Xiangzhuang vegetables at $15.50, Zhongxing vegetables at $15, Xuzhou vegetables at $14.80, and Bozhou vegetables at various prices around $14.</p>

Market prices have continued to rise, with both road and spot goods rising by four cents yesterday, with a total of more than 1,660 transactions. Moreover, the rise in factory oil is more rapid, rising by one yuan more than the lowest price. Peanut oil was also driven up by thirty to forty cents, with a total of 600 transactions, it is said.</p>

<p>— Zhi Shui</p>
<p>There is an English detective novelist named Conan Doyle, whose works were translated a lot by Lin Qinnan in the past. Western literary critics praised Mr. Ke's detective novels for being able to use the "achievements" of modern science, so although they are bizarre, they do not fall into absurdity.</p>
<p>So, this Mr. Ke is not an amateur in science. However, after the European War, we heard that this gentleman talked a lot about "Spiritualism," established societies, published periodicals, and gave lectures everywhere. Some people regarded the communication between humans and ghosts and the future of mankind as absurd, while others believed it to be revelation and prophecy.</p>
<p>There is also an English science fiction writer named Wells, whose international reputation is even greater. His "Outline of History" has also been translated into Chinese. Looking at his works, he can indeed be said to be a true scientist. However, a Reuters dispatch a few days ago said that he also made predictions about international politics in the past five years.</p>
<p>We believe that future changes in international politics can be predicted, but they must be based on the iron laws of social science, and then it is not a blind guess. Although Mr. Wells's "predictions" are much more beautiful than our "piling back maps," we always feel that they have a bit of Jianghu air. For example, he said that in the future, there will be a naval battle between Japan and the United States in the Pacific. The Japanese army will win first, but will be defeated by a plague, and then a great revolution will occur in Japan, etc., placing the factors of the great revolution on an unknowable plague.</p>
<p>Recently, newspapers have frequently reported that "the situation between Japan and Russia is dangerous," and political observers have said that 1935 will be a difficult year. People are panicking and turning to "prophecy." At this moment, a magazine issued a call for papers for the New Year's issue next year, with the topic of "The Future of Shanghai," which is to ask people to write some "predictions." The magazine editor's sense is the most sensitive, and they know that the vast readers are asking for "predictions." Originally, in this awkward situation, many people are extremely confused, and giving some reasonable "predictions" is a good thing and necessary.</p>
<p>However, if a "prediction" is reasonable, it will expose the Western mirror of some people. So we might as well "predict" first:</p>
<p>Truly reasonable predictions will not exist within China.</p>
<h3 id="e277">What is "Direction"? <a href="#e277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>— Gu Xiongfei</p>
<p>The film "Spring Silkworms" has been released, and some people criticize it as "sparse human direction."</p>
<p>"Sparse human direction," what does this mean? After thinking about it carefully, I reluctantly found an explanation: Western movie advertisements often say that there are thousands or tens of thousands of actors, while "Spring Silkworms" has only twenty or thirty people at most. Perhaps it means that there are too few people on stage. If there are too few, just say there are too few. Why say "sparse"? If the opposite of "sparse" is "dense," then hiring more extras and having them squeeze together tightly and filming it would be a film with a "climax"!</p>
<p>I am not a "film critic," so of course I don't want to discuss whether it is good or bad for people in the film to be "sparse" or "dense." What I want to say now is the meaning of the word "direction." Life is becoming more and more complex and changing. The original words are not enough, and more must be added. These new words can be newly created or imported, but they must have a clear meaning. But now we have to read articles embedded with many inexplicable new (?) words. The author seems to think that as long as he embeds some new words, his article will be valuable. "Direction" is one of them. It is used in articles and in conversations, but its meaning is ignored. It is really "depressing" to read and hear.</p>
<p>Originally, this is also a Japanese word, a stage play term.</p>
<p>Of course, a play must have a script, but having a script does not mean that there is a play to watch. There is also an important thing: how to materialize this script on the stage. This is called "direction" in Japanese, and we call it "rehearsal." Analyzing the theme and plot of the script, assigning roles, and unifying the stage equipment, scenery, and everything else that constitutes the play to make the script appear three-dimensionally on the stage丨this whole process is called "rehearsal." The person who undertakes this work is called the "director," and in Japanese it is called the "director." As for after the rehearsal is successful, when it is publicly performed on the stage for the audience, the "director" no longer cares about the control of the stage. That is the responsibility of the "stage supervisor."</p>
<p>An ideal "director" uses the background and props as his materials, not to mention that the actors are also his materials, and even the script is his material. He uses these to "create"; a good director has his unique "rehearsal method." Therefore, the same script can be rehearsed into very different things under the direction of different directors, and a bad director can make a mess of the script.</p>
<p>The recently performed "Roar, China" was successful in many ways, and its public release should receive the same attention from cultural circles as "Spring Silkworms." However, the impression I got this time was very different from the impression I got when I saw the Tsukiji Troupe perform the same script in Japan. To give the most common example: similarly, it is the awakening and resistance of the masses, but what the Drama Association rehearsed was a chaotic scene of just shouting slogans, while the scene rehearsed by the Tsukiji Troupe was full of the collective dynamic melody, which had actually broken through the scope of narrow "realism," and what filled the entire scene was not only "excitement," but a well-organized torrent of "power." This, needless to say, is a reflection of the different rehearsal methods of the directors, and also a reflection of the different degrees of worldview between the two directors and the different nature of the two groups, the Drama Association and the Tsukiji Troupe.</p>
<p>As for movies, the word "direction" cannot be used at all. Because, in movies, acting is not considered art. It is only considered art when it is captured by the camera from a certain angle and then replayed. Moreover, it cannot be replayed after it is captured. It must also be cut and arranged, and reorganized. There is a special term for this in film production, which cannot be confused with the "direction" of stage plays.</p>
<h3 id="e278">Literary Men Despise Each Other <a href="#e278" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c278" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">278</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Shixia</p>
<p>Zhao Yi's "Clumsy Examination of Everything" has an article about literary men despising each other, which describes the stories of literary men despising each other between the Qin and Han Dynasties and the Six Dynasties, which is already very detailed. In my opinion, literary men despising each other originated from the philosophers of the Zhou and Qin Dynasties. Confucius said, "People with different paths do not conspire with each other." The philosophers each held a theory and slandered each other. This is the ideological bias of those who despise each other. There is a saying today: "Those in the same industry are prone to jealousy." To slander others in order to praise oneself, and to express oneself in order to belittle others, this is the constant feeling in the psychology of those who despise each other. There is also a saying: "Three sentences cannot be separated from one's profession." Talking about the joys and sorrows of one's own work, and also discussing the gains and losses of colleagues, this is also the habit of those who despise each other in their language. Du Fu said, "Do not despise modern people and love ancient people." To express the nostalgic feelings of thinking about the past, and to sigh that those who come later are not as good as the ancients, this is the fallacy in the historical view of those who despise each other. What the ancients called liking cinnabar and disliking plain, discussing sweetness and avoiding bitterness, respecting the ancient and despising the present, valuing the distant and belittling the near, as well as favoring the same and attacking the different, and treating as master and slave, all seem to not go beyond these four points. Understanding this is to understand why literary men despise each other.</p>
<p>Since the Tang Dynasty, the stories of literary men despising each other are countless. Now, I will only briefly cite the example of fathers and sons who were both literary men and despised each other, to show that even as close as father and son, they do not give way to each other. Confucius only said that one should not give way to one's teacher when it comes to benevolence. Unexpectedly, there is actually a matter of not giving way to one's father when it comes to literature. During the Tang Dynasty, Lu Yuqing once transferred from Minister of the Right of the Ministry of Rites to Magistrate of Luochuan. When discussing matters, he was arrogant and unashamed, but when judging matters, his writing was nowhere to be found. Someone ridiculed him and said, "When speaking, his beak is three inches long, and when judging matters, his hand weighs five catties." His son also ridiculed him and said, "Lu Yuqing, his pen is weak and his mouth is hard. Once he receives a lawsuit, he cannot judge it in ten days." He sent the case under the bedding. Yuqing got it and read it, and said, "It must be that dog!" So he whipped him. During the Chenghua and Hongzhi periods of the Ming Dynasty, Li Dongyang's articles and titles were the highest in the world. One son, named Zhaoxian, with the courtesy name of Zhenbo, had the talent of reading several lines at a glance, and was known as surpassing his father at the time. However, he was often troubled in the imperial examinations. Public opinion was dissatisfied, and the examiners paid attention to finding and taking him, but he was lost or missed, and he could not be selected. So he died with his aspirations. Dongyang eventually died without an heir. Zhaoxian loved prostitutes, and Dongyang condemned him. He specially wrote on the door of his residence, "Today Willow Lane, tomorrow Flower Street. Reciting poems and reading books, scholar, scholar!" Zhaoxian returned, saw it, and immediately continued to write, "Today's heavy rain, tomorrow's strong wind. Harmonizing Yin and Yang, Prime Minister, Prime Minister!" Others, such as Gong Banlun of the Qing Dynasty towards his father Ding'an, and Guo Zhuoying towards his father Songtao, one used paint to smear his books after death, and knocked on his wooden tablet with a pen, and the other used a 100-point assessment method and only gave his father's ancient articles 50 points. These are all examples of fathers and sons who were both literary men and despised each other.</p>
<p>Someone said to me, the reason why today's literary men despise each other is different from the past. Because in today's world, there is nothing to say, only humor! I don't know if it's true, I will ask the great humorist Mr. Lin Yutang.</p>
<h3 id="e279">Correction of "Empty-Handed" <a href="#e279" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c279" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">279</a></h3>
<p>— Feng Zhiyu</p>
<p>When I wrote "Empty-Handed" a few days ago, I didn't have a book at hand. When it came to the part of "Yan's Family Instructions," I only relied on my memory. Later, I was afraid of making mistakes, so I tried to find the original book to check it, and found that I had made a mistake in my description of Yan Zhitui. His "Teaching Sons" chapter says丨</p>
<p>"During the Qi Dynasty, there was a scholar-official who once said to me: I have a son who is seventeen years old and knows a little about writing. I taught him the Xianbei language and playing the pipa, and he is somewhat knowledgeable. If he uses this to serve the nobles and ministers, he will be loved by everyone, and it is also important." I bowed my head and did not answer at that time. How strange is this son's teaching of his son. If he achieves the position of Prime Minister through this profession, I would not want you to do it."</p>
<p>Then the Qi scholar's method is the method of officials, merchants, gentlemen and gentry after the Gengzi year. Mr. Shi Zhicun is a combination of the two archetypes of the Qi scholar and Yan Zhitui, and it is also the method of some people now, which can be renamed "Northern Dynasty style morality," and it is still a serious social problem.</p>
<p>I should be very sorry to Mr. Yan, but he has already died, and it doesn't matter whether I apologize or not. Now I am only correcting my mistakes to Mr. Shi and the readers here.</p>

<p>The "Free Talk" on the 17th contained an article entitled "A Record of Watching Roaring in Tokyo" signed "Gao Ming." It said: "That night, two plays were performed, one of which was Jiang Kouhuan's "Opium War." "This play was later renamed "The First European Flag" and has been translated into Chinese by a certain gentleman." But as far as I know, "Opium War" was written by Murayama Tomoyoshi and was translated last year by Yuan Shu, who was transformed from Yuan Xueyi and Yuan Xiaoyi into the current Yuan Xiaoyi, and was published by Hufeng Bookstore.</p>

<p>— Maupassant, translated by Li Weike</p>
<p>"What did he say, this gentleman?"</p>
<p>"He said that Mr. Lecaru would come here in person tonight."</p>
<p>Mr. Lecaru was a notary who had dealings with Old Man Roland, and also a friend of sorts. Since he had someone notify in advance that he would come to visit in the evening, there must be some urgent and important matter; so the four members of the Roland family looked at each other, and like all people with meager family property who were afraid of having dealings with a notary, everyone was disturbed by this news. Because in their minds, the name of a notary would make people think of terms, inheritance, lawsuits, and a whole bunch of pleasant or terrible things. After a few seconds of silence, the father murmured:</p>
<p>"What's going on?"</p>
<p>Mrs. Lu laughed:</p>
<p>"Don't think about it, it must be a matter of inheritance. I believe it must be, I am a lucky star."</p>
<p>But they had never hoped that anyone would leave them anything after death.</p>
<p>Grandma Roland, who had a very good memory of blood relations, immediately searched her own and her husband's relatives in her mind, tracing the parent-child relationship from generation to generation, and tracing the branches of the cousin relationship.</p>
<p>She didn't even take off her hat and asked:</p>
<p>"Hey, Dad, (she calls her husband "Dad" at home, and sometimes calls "Mr. Roland" in front of guests,) hey, Dad, do you remember who Joseph Lebrun's second wife was?"</p>
<p>"I remember, a girl named Dumeny, the daughter of a paper shop owner."</p>
<p>"Did he have children?"</p>
<p>"I remember there were, at least four or five."</p>
<p>"That's not right, then there won't be anything in this area."</p>
<p>She was already enthusiastically engaged in this search, eager for a small fortune to fall on them from the sky. Bill was very fond of his mother. He knew that his mother liked to daydream a little, and he was afraid that if the news was not good but bad, it would disappoint his mother and make her feel a little pain and a little sadness. He stopped her and said:</p>
<p>"Mom, don't be too enthusiastic. There won't be any more American uncles like that. I think, nine times out of ten"</p>
<p>"It's coming to propose marriage to Jian."</p>
<p>Everyone was a little surprised to hear this, and Jian was even more angry that his brother had said this in front of Mrs. Lu.</p>
<p>"Why is it proposing marriage to me and not to you? This assumption is very debatable. You are the eldest son; others"</p>
<p>"Will think of you first. Besides, I, I don't want to get married."</p>
<p>Bill mocked him:</p>
<p>"Then are you already someone's lover?"</p>
<p>The other was very unhappy and replied:</p>
<p>"Do you have to be someone's lover to say that you don't want to get married?"</p>
<p>"Ah! That's right, the word "yet" corrects everything; you are waiting."</p>
<p>"Whatever you want, just say I'm waiting."</p>
<p>But Old Man Roland listened to their words, thought for a while, and suddenly came to the most plausible conclusion:</p>
<p>"Okay! We are so stupid to think about it like this. Mr. Lecaru is our friend. He knows Bill is looking for"</p>
<p>"A clinic, and Jian is looking for a law firm. He must have seen some place that suits the needs of one of you two."</p>
<p>This matter was so simple and possible that everyone agreed.</p>
<p>"Dinner is ready," said the maid.</p>
<p>So everyone went back to their rooms to wash their hands before sitting down at the table. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Talking Points</p>
<h3 id="e282">Talking about "National X" <a href="#e282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>— Lizhai</p>
<p>In our old nation, the application of the word "national" is the most widespread and almost "department store"-like.</p>
<p>Since the opening of the sea ban and the arrival of foreigners from the East, some progressive scholars and officials who were making a fuss about "Westernization" and "Renovation" during the "Xianfeng and Tongzhi periods," a group of stubborn conservatives carried out the word "national quintessence" as a weapon of resistance. This "national quintessence," on the one hand, is all-encompassing for "national goods civilization," and on the other hand, it is the originator of all "Tu X."</p>
<p>Since the abolition of the imperial examination and the opening of schools, up to now, the first item listed as a compulsory course in various schools is our country's "national language," which is so profound and has no scope that many old scholars and pedants with white hair only touch the threshold in the years of "ear-shun" and "ancient hope," and cannot be said to "enter the hall and enter the room."</p>
<p>As the sum of Chinese academic thought that has not been collated, "Sage Kang" and "Madman Zhang" are the most skilled, and Sage Liang and Dr. Hu are also not bad, it is our country's "top-notch" "national studies."</p>
<p>Hospitals have been established one after another, and "doctors" have become more and more popular. What "subcutaneous injection" and "X-ray" have become "unclear." Therefore, "national goods doctors" who take "looking, smelling, asking, and cutting" as the procedure and "liver wood khắc spleen soil" as the classic have risen up to defend themselves, carrying out the big signboard opposite Western medicine: "national medicine." In connection with this, also making a big fuss about its "distilled water" and "scientification" is the "national pharmacy" that "follows the ancient method" of grass roots and tree bark.</p>
<p>Some "old heroes" who "followed the Prime Minister for decades" once "lost their souls," and lowered the flag at half-mast, calling on the officials and the governed to hold the coffin. First, they allocate a batch of people's fat and people's cream to "handle the funeral," and then they allocate a batch of national treasury to repair the Huabiao, tomb passages, and Wengzhong. This set of formulas is called "national funeral." Some "national funerals" are actually heavily discounted and can only be regarded as "official funerals."</p>
<p>When our nation encounters disputes and confrontations, and adds each other with vicious words, it often uses the sexual organs involving the mother, aunt, wife, and younger sister as the center of attack. is A 　jian　's old 　　a hundred "national horses" that were occasionally obtained in his youth.</p>
<p>Plum has five petals, symbolizing the five powers, five courts, and five races. Therefore, it is given the title "national flower" However, since the September 18th Incident, the "friendly country" has discounted the five races by 20% for us, becoming "four joys," so whether the "national flower" continues to belong to plum seems to be still under consideration.</p>
<p>The process of recording time according to the stems and branches, five elements, four seasons, and eight festivals is the "Tu calendar" that Wu Jianguang, Yan Fusun, Xu Suichu, and all the merchants who hope and believe in it must leave and develop separately, and it is now beginning to be sold again.</p>
<p>Mr. Confucius the Second "doesn't know in March," only eats and does nothing, takes being slaughtered as an inevitable destination, and is the most adept at "non-resistance doctrine." It is the "national animal" that the publication of the master of humor has given the title to.</p>
<p>The "friendly country" of the East continues to expand their "lifeline" to the West, and we continue to lose divisions and land, making the ancient objects move south and the people uneasy. This unfinished history is the "national crisis" that everyone knows.</p>
<p>Since the country is in distress, how can we not save it? Therefore, all "XX save the country" have become a situation where programs are mixed and each does its "best." However, the most dominant and promoted by some big bellies is still the saying that "starting from saving the leaky chalice" is the most "modern." Therefore, it has become a trend for a while recently, and it is filling the pockets of many "patriotic people," that is, "national goods."</p>
<p>The little turtles that are displayed in the Chinese Pavilion of the Chicago Expo by several compatriots with "rich national spirit" as "national goods" and sold for four US dollars each can be named "national turtles"!</p>
<p>Many "writers" with solitary loyalty and public anger use them as raw materials for manuscript fees, write them in poems, and write them in articles. Thousands of calls are still not seen, and their form is vague, that is, "national soul."</p>
<p>As the most popular proposition for saving the country, recently, it has also used the "modern ring competition" of "national examination" to select talents, that is, "national art."</p>
<p>"National art to save the country" is almost the rearguard of a large number of "XX to save the country." But if "national art" can no longer save the country, and the Eight Immortals Sword and Tai Chi Quan finally cannot defeat the "friendly country's" airplanes and cannons, then it will be very bad. Maybe Lingzhi Honjo Shigeto and his like will be like Shi Jin, and expand the "lifeline to the hinterland from the border." At that time, all "　　　"　　　、　　 also learn some time changes、　　 two times, 　　　○"!</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>Once "National ○" is realized, the public of Ah Dou will also inevitably follow the "transformation," and abolish all the titles of "Oldest," "Third," "Seventh," and "Ninth," all of which will be counted as "ranked fourth," and collectively called "China A-Si"!</p>

<p>— Jing Jia</p>
<p>The telephone rang. It was two o'clock in the afternoon. Sunlight shone on the foot of the east wall.</p>
<p>The maid picked up the receiver and held it to her ear, "Miss? Miss hasn't gotten up yet!"</p>
<p>Just then, Miss Tao woke up. She yawned in bed.</p>
<p>"Who? Who's calling?" she asked lazily.</p>
<p>"The manager, sir."</p>
<p>"Move the phone to the bedside!" she commanded, and the maid expertly followed the order.</p>
<p>"Who? Oh, Mr. Wang? Good morning, I just woke up. What's the matter? ... Okay, I'll definitely be there a little earlier. Who? Little Chen? Where is he? I don't care. That's fine too. Yes, right. Right. Goodbye."</p>
<p>Miss Tao was about to hang up when she suddenly remembered something and quickly put the receiver to her ear.</p>
<p>"Hello, Mr. Wang, please tell Little Chen, don't let tonight be like last time. Otherwise, I won't stand for it... Hahahaha. Goodbye!"</p>
<p>She lazily hung up the phone and stretched. She sat up.</p>
<p>An hour later, she finally finished washing up. After eating her breakfast, the clock struck four.</p>
<p>She picked up the phone and dialed a number.</p>
<p>"Who? Please ask Mr. Wu to answer the phone... Oh, is that you, Old Wu? Yes, I just got up. How about dinner at the New Asia tonight? ... What, you're not going? Why? ... Headache? I don't care. You're definitely not going? ... Okay, don't bother with me from now on."</p>
<p>She angrily hung up the phone. Just as she was about to turn around, the phone rang again. She picked it up furiously.</p>
<p>"Who?" she shouted.</p>
<p>"Little Chen? What's up? I'm not going, I have a bit of a headache. Yes, a headache. I'm not putting on airs, you misunderstood. ... I really can't go. Look, my voice is even trembling!... "</p>
<p>The maid walked in, "Miss, Mr. Wu is here."</p>
<p>Miss Tao hung up the phone and walked into the living room.</p>
<p>"What a temper, I said something jokingly and you took it seriously!" Mr. Wu said with a smile.</p>
<p>"You rascal!" Miss Tao buried her head in his arms.</p>
<p>"You should go to the dance hall tonight. It's a grand tea dance today!"</p>
<p>"Of course. I'll dance with you. You're not allowed to dance with anyone else."</p>
<p>"That won't do, Little Chen will make a fuss."</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter. Otherwise, you have to take a day off and spend the whole day playing with me."</p>
<p>"Don't be shameless!" She grabbed his beard.</p>
<p>"Don't grab my beard! It hurts! You're such a child."</p>
<p>"You're an old child."</p>
<p>"Haha!" Old Wu laughed, "Really, why are you always clinging to me, an old child?"</p>
<p>"Don't you say that!"</p>
<p>"Hahahaha!"</p>
<p>"This cheongsam doesn't look good anymore!" she said softly.</p>
<p>"Go buy one!"</p>
<p>"It's time to eat too!" she said, "I'll be half-dead tonight!"</p>
<p>"Okay, let's go buy some fabric first!"</p>
<p>"Mmm."</p>
<p>So they went out and got in the car.</p>
<p>In the evening, she danced with Old Wu. Later, she danced with Little Chen again. While dancing, Little Chen whispered to her, "Do you love me or not?"</p>
<p>"I love you and I love him," she said with a smile.</p>
<p>"Why is that?"</p>
<p>"I love you for your face. I love him for his money."</p>
<p>The east dawned, and she took her tired body home.</p>
<h3 id="e284">After Reading "A Review of Vases and Vase Stands" <a href="#e284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>The other day, I read Mr. Jing Jia's "A Review of Vases and Vase Stands" in the Spring and Autumn column of this newspaper, criticizing my work "Flowers or Vase Stands?" as being somewhat unnatural. However, after reading Mr. Jing Jia's masterpiece, I am also very dissatisfied with Mr. Jing Jia's views and feel that there are inconsistencies, so I cannot help but come out to explain.</p>
<p>Mr. Jing Jia has already admitted that the term "vase" contains a lot of insulting elements. I think he should know that insult is something that everyone is unwilling to accept. Should we women endure the widespread insult of the term "vase"? He also said that the person who came up with this term only feels embarrassed, inferior, and self-deprecating.</p>
<p>But I can say that the opposite is true. The person who came up with that term is probably ecstatic and receiving praise. Didn't Mr. Jing Jia also admit from the beginning that in recent years "vase" has become a common term for women with professions? If your ideas are echoed by the public, wouldn't that be a very joyful thing? What is there to be embarrassed about? Indeed, true gold is not afraid of fire, but I cannot deny that there is absolutely no fake gold mixed in with professional women, and professional men are not purely true gold either.</p>
<p>As for the term "vase stand," my views are also completely different from Mr. Jing Jia's explanation. Mr. Jing Jia's explanation is that the vase is elevated by the stand, so he says that women must rely on men to enhance everything about women, but my original intention is that modern female employees in companies and organizations are ornaments and are called "vases." Aren't modern male employees in companies and organizations also ornaments? Since ornamental female employees have already been called "vases," then ornamental male employees are naturally either "flowers" or "vase stands." The "vase stand" is precisely what the "vase" steps on, because there are not a few modern male employees who willingly prostrate themselves under the feet of modern female employees to serve them!</p>
<p>As for saying that people with self-respect would never apply these terms to others, this sounds very right, but unfortunately, people nowadays don't have the same understanding and reason as Mr. Jing Jia. Otherwise, the term "vase" would not have become so widespread that even Mr. Jing Jia cannot help but admit that it has become a common term for women with professions.</p>
<p>Indeed, society needs mutual assistance and cannot be established unilaterally by men or women, but when gender equality is just beginning and women's professions are just sprouting, how can we allow others to destroy them so widely? We can disdain the contemptible creatures who came up with this term, but there are so many people who blindly follow him that almost all professional women in the country are affected by him. Should we women forever embrace a policy of non-resistance?</p>

<p>Act IV: Where to Go? Scene 1</p>
<p>Security Team Member A: Heavens, my god, what's going to happen? Third Master Zhou, we're finished now.</p>
<p>Village Chief: Help!</p>
<p>Security Team Member B: What's the use of shouting like that? Who's going to come and save you?</p>
<p>Village Chief: If I had known this, we should have left with that team of soldiers.</p>
<p>Security Team Member A: But I think it's okay. It must be the Japanese soldiers fighting the Volunteer Army now. When the Japanese soldiers win, they will come back to save us. Let's wait.</p>
<p>Security Team Member B: What are you talking about? What if the Japanese soldiers are defeated? Are we just going to wait here to die?</p>
<p>Village Chief: Don't be ridiculous, the Japanese soldiers won't be defeated.</p>
<p>Security Team Member B: In any case, we can't just wait here. Let's all think of a way to untie the ropes and leave. Third Master, you untie mine first. Then I'll untie yours.</p>
<p>Village Chief: I won't do that. If I untie you and you run away, who am I going to look for?</p>
<p>Security Team Member A: That's right, if you run away alone, then we're really out of luck.</p>
<p>Security Team Member B: Hey! You guys are really... Okay, Third Master, I'll trust you. I'll untie you first. I'm not afraid of you running away.</p>
<p>(Security Team Member B gets close to the Village Chief. The Young Man appears from behind the tree at this time, watches for a long time, and gently approaches them, kicking Security Team Member B to the ground.)</p>
<p>Young Man: You bastard, still trying to escape?</p>
<p>(The Village Chief sees the Young Man and is shocked.)</p>
<p>Young Man: Oh? You're here? What's up? Haha, I didn't expect I'd see you again. Do you recognize me? (Slaps him) You bastard! Now you've run into my hands. Do you still want to collect taxes? (Someone blows a gathering horn in the distance)</p>
<p>Village Chief: Big Brother Monk, thank you, spare me this time.</p>
<p>Young Man: Spare you? Okay. Come on! (To inside) Come and see our village chief worshiping the sky.</p>
<p>(Many Volunteer Army soldiers capture a Japanese prisoner of war, followed by several people who were captured by the Japanese soldiers.)</p>
<p>Security Team Member A: Hey! Why are they back? Did the Japanese soldiers release them?</p>
<p>Village Chief: Don't make a sound! (Trembling) We're finished now that we've run into the Volunteer Army.</p>
<p>Security Team Member B: Is that right? So the Japanese soldiers were defeated after all.</p>
<p>Platoon Leader: (Seeing the Village Chief and them) Hey! Who are these people?</p>
<p>Young Man: This is our village chief. He usually does too many good deeds, so everyone has tied him up.</p>
<p>Platoon Leader: Bah! Damned thing.</p>
<p>Soldier A: Damn it, this time it's really satisfying.</p>
<p>Young Man B: What exactly happened? How did they wipe out more than a hundred people all at once?</p>
<p>Soldier B: Don't you know? We ambushed on both sides of the mountain at the gate. We knew the Japanese soldiers would definitely go there, so we used explosives to blow up the mountain. The rocks and wood all rolled down. We were afraid they wouldn't die?</p>
<p>Young Man: Platoon Leader, what do you think we should do with these traitors?</p>
<p>Platoon Leader: Isn't that easy? Take them to the rice field over there and let the villagers judge them.</p>
<p>Young Man C: That's great, come on, let's take them over there. Today, we can finally vent our anger!</p>
<p>Village Chief: (To the Platoon Leader) Sir, save our lives!</p>
<p>Platoon Leader: Bah, to hell with you. (Everyone laughs.) (The Young Men pull the Village Chief and the other two away.) Hey, now let's interrogate that prisoner of war. How exactly did he get captured?</p>
