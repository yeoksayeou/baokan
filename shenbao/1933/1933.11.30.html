<h3>時評　紗價暴落與棉業統制會仁</h3>
<p>昨棉市價。突告大落。一日間猛跌六元有奇。爲最近數月來所僅見。據報章所載。市價低落之原因有二。其一爲鑒於閩變發生。恐南方走銷。行將絶望。其二爲棉業統制會最近以吸進之棉紗。復行抛出五千包所致。</p>
<p>夫中國棉紗價格之必將日趨下游。在向具悲觀論者視之。原爲今後必然之現象。然昨日棉紗價格之下落。如果係出之於以提高紗價自任之棉業統制會賣出所致。則吾人有不能已於言者。</p>
<p>吾人回憶業統制會於决定提高紗價時。曾推定其原因爲交易所存紗過多之故。是以有合興公司之組織。起而大量收買存紗。即在前週四五六三日間。棉統會爲穩定市價。尚派人出而收進二萬餘包左右。其目的固皆爲欲提高今日之紗價也。且曩日棉統會負責人。亦曾對外界宣言。以爲該會所收之紗。將盡數運往外埠。决不再在本埠放出。詞意肯切。吾人方謂此紗價或有暫時站定之可能。孰期不數日間。而所昭示之事實如此。是則往日之絶對信任棉統會者。今後不將致疑於棉統會乎。月前市上曾有棉統會投機之謡傳。至是恐將益熾矣。</p>
<p>在吾人以旁觀者之立塲觀察。以爲今日棉紗價格之每况愈下。其原因固非一言可盡。要之如交易所存紗之日厚。尚不過爲一近因。至價格下落之眞實原因。應於交易所存紗何以日厚之原因中求之據吾人管窺所及。九一八而後。華中華南一帶。抵制日貨之風較烈。於是日廠之紗。壓低其價格。在華北市塲獨占推銷。近則華中華南。市塲上亦到處有日紗之跡。且日紗以外。尚有其他外紗侵入。外紗之充斥市塲。即相對的減縮中國人民對於華紗之購買力。事實上今日全國華廠紗錠。僅二百六十萬枚左右。平均每百五十人始有紗錠一枚。設使今日我市塲上而無外紗。則華紗當感供不應求之苦。市價亦斷無下落之理。其所以下落者。實緣於外紗之競爭也。而此競爭之結果。華紗遂立於絶不利之地位矣。</p>
<p>然則華紗何以不能與外紗相競爭歟。其最顯著之原因。厥爲不平等條約之束縛與外廠資本之雄厚。其他如租稅負担之不平衡。實爲一極大之原因。即以印花稅而論。華廠必需繳納。而外廠可豁免。他如棉紗統稅。以二十三支爲區别標凖。是無異於優待以紡細紗爲主之外廠。而苛待以紡粗紗爲主之華廠。此外如各地各項苛雜稅捐。外廠亦皆可一律避免。其結果外紗與華紗之地位。顯然不同。而華紗之不足與外紗抗衡。已成爲必然之形勢。是無怪中國市塲之將爲外紗所把持。而華紗走銷之途愈趨愈狹矣。</p>
<p>故在今日而欲言提高紗價。吾人應當於其根本病源着想。若交易所存紗之日積。正因華紗銷路日窄所致。若銷路能設法使之擴張。換言之。即華紗障害能設法泯滅。則紗價安有不不提而自高哉。一昨紗價之狂落。一方面固受棉統會抛出之影響。但另一方面。亦正所以促棉統會今後之努力。倘棉統會今後能從根本着想。不專致意於收紗賣紗之舉。則紗價不難提高。而棉統會亦將羣疑盡釋矣</p>

<h3>列國頗棘手</h3>
<p>（東京）杉村陽太郎視察中　　國各地、二十八日回東京、杉村對記者談、中國問題、其内容大致如下、（一）中國之對外關係、余今次赴華、在各地直接會見中國政客及留華歐美人士、據余所見聞、中國之對外觀察、比從前漸次變更、即中國人從來專依賴歐美實行諸事、然今一變其態度、信賴自已之思想、頗爲顯著、從前巴黎和平會議及華盛頓會議當時、中國利用外國之力、列國亦援助中國因此列國在遠東之勢力關係異常紛糾、然現在此種狀態已被一掃、列國駐華官憲、對於中國頗覺棘手、</p>
<h3>宋子文無力</h3>
<p>國聯與中國合作問題、日本方面雖重視内容、然中國政府並不以爲重大問題、其專員賴希曼亦不過纒綿於宋文一人而已、宋子文今日之立場、有何能力爲事乎、（二）中國之對日觀、現在中國對於日本之觀察、頗多誤點、即中國對於日本之經濟困難、議會政治與法西斯之種突、日本所謂國難等、作中國式之誇大觀察、余侬此列舉各種事實、說明此種觀察之錯誤、在此狀態之中、獨有留日學生出身之人物、有正當之對日觀察、其認識日本之正確、非與歐美留學者流之無常識可比矣、</p>
<h3>日政策要點</h3>
<p>（三）日對華政策之要點、日本對中國之觀察、應在何處置其重點爲緊要問題、祇觀上海等繁華都會、以爲觀察中國之對照不可也、内地方面、内亂續發、各地富豪、帶其家産、集中上海、因此一千萬元之現銀流入上海、以致現出變態的通貨膨脹景象、然農工民衆之窮迫疲憊、達其極點、日本爲政者、應觀察中國全局面、而决定即於實際之政策爲要也、（二十九日日聯電）</p>
<h3>利用親日派</h3>

<h3>廣田之野心　對列强亦用分化手段　將先向英美促進交涉</h3>

<p>余又見日人之商務侵略、到處勝利、藉以供給擴張帝國之財源、與陸海軍巨額預算、菲律濱方面、自上屆美國會在菲島獨立案内、明告以行將停止購買其産品後、其農民已暗中冀望在日本日事擴張之經濟帝國内、獲得一適當位置、而美國在菲之海陸軍、則對於日本未來之擴張、孤掌難鳴、其形勢正類一八九八年西班牙之保衛古巴、中國方面、則在留日學生柄政之下、正遲徊審議、在其政治經濟獨立完全屈服於日人以前、究能獲得美國幾許有效之援助也、至於日本政府、現完全在主戰派控制之下、而由陸海外財四省組織「中心内閣」統治一切、其人民完全受陸軍省統制之報紙宣傳所麻醉、不容任何内閣在建造帝國之運動中懸崖勒馬、返斾回轍、因此青年兇手暗殺其心懷遲疑之官長者、今已奉爲全國之英雄、余見日本好爲誇言之秉國鈞者、方信彼等皆鴻運高照、不論如何冒險與阻碍、苟在目今行事、决不失敗同時全世界、尤其美國、則皆在否運照臨之下、不能阻止日人之行動、</p>
<p>至於檀香山、自企圖在經濟復興運動下結合黃白種之舉、未見成功、沮喪之餘、在政治方面、已入麻痺狀態、靜待剥奪其人民代表政府之權、（按美政府曾有總統得派非本島人爲該島總督之議未爲國會通過）現島民之業已覺悟者、則皆同情於海陸軍主張、認有雙重國籍之日本民族雜居島内、爲美國國防上不可容忍之局勢、</p>
<p>今夏以來、太平洋歷史、已有迅速變化、日本已公然宣稱其海軍比率將不復能安然居於英美之卜、其對於先進工業國之商務、已作公開之進攻、美政府亦已抛棄條約足以保護領土利益之信心、開始大造軍艦、定將使其海軍實力、足與日本相匹敵、而十五年來美國不睐蘇俄之政策亦亦實放棄、再者、日本旣給予海軍長官以蹂躪其政府所訂條約之權、更使任何自尊國家、不能再與日本外交家訂立限制軍備之契約、</p>
<p>余旣指陳太平洋上此種險惡情勢、遂多直率詢余曰、「君以爲日美間將戰爭乎、倘有戰爭、則在何時」此此種直率詢問、常易引起複雜答語、余故試擬前提數項、力求其直率、詢問者自下斷語焉、</p>
<p>前提一日本之軍閥、似已不復能希望其自内崩潰、若輩深信此時方在吉星照臨之下、可冒任何危險、以期一勞永逸建立檀香山以西太平洋上之覇權、而絶對控制中國本部之政治與經濟、其所需經費、則可取自此等地方及在歐洲帝國僻遠領土所攫得之貿易、日本人民、則已深信宣傳及投時好之言論、以爲日本必可成功、白種國家、尤其英國、定將衰落、將不容其政府對於擴張帝國建威定覇之蓮動、稍事審徊遲疑、或知難而退、</p>
<p>前提二至美政府方面、在太平洋政策上、能否有澈底相反行動、使日本不復感到美國爲其野心之威脅、似屬疑問、蓋處今日之勢、欲眞實樹立日美友誼、必將放棄門户開放政策、承認日本違背條約而得之領土對於中國、不復予以絲毫精神援助並須完全應允日人要求禁美商售飛機與中國、禁美人敎華人航空技術、又須今後非得日人同意、勿貸欵項或棉麥與中國、同時美國對於蘇俄、亦同樣不可稍有足以鼓勵其太平洋方面抵抗力之行爲、</p>
<p>前提三再者、日本在一九三五年以後加入限制海軍之條件、能否爲美政府所接受、亦殊屬疑問、此項條件、（一）絶對平等、放棄向來所持日本國防線較短祗需英美海軍五分之三已足保衛之理論、（二）承認日本徑爲太平洋代管諸島之主人、然卽令美政府願有此兩種讓步、亦將不能與彼保留一旦軍閥認爲事急時得以片面廢約權之國家、成立契約關係也、况在美國方面、國務院與海陸軍方面、對於現行海軍限制、信美國業已受欺者日衆、據彼等觀念、日本愛國者雖努詈其政治家簽訂華府倫敦兩約之誤國、而一面正在暗笑美人之受欺、與日人之有利、蓋此兩約、能使日本追踵海軍較大之國家、而不虞激起造艦競爭、而天眞爛漫之胡佛政府、則因此深信戰爭與作戰材料、已成過去陳述、同時日本王戰派、則猛速推進其帝國計劃、再日本因代管太平洋諸島、得爲相當準備、據美國史丹萊海軍少將言、其效力等於在全太平洋遍設根據地、倘若美國海軍有相對的行動、則因有兩約故、將被指爲違約也、</p>
<p>前提四倘美國繼續第二前提内所述政策時、則中國人民之抵抗日人控制、亦將繼續不息、而華人之抗日、倘能有充分長久、則足以使日人流血以至於死、蓋若欲警衛另一最大區域若滿洲者、縱竭日本全部常備軍、猶將虞其不足也、在日本之立場言之、向美國冒險一擊、似較他國較少危險、此蓋仍襲一九零四年不宣不戰突攻俄國之心理、當時日人目的物、在於朝鮮、而非俄國、但認爲非使俄人不能再激起韓人抵抗時、朝鮮不能屈服於日本、須知日人之理解、常循解剖途徑進行者也、</p>
<p>吾人根據以上四項前提、欲求當事者根據實際情形與現在心理、作聰明的審察、希望絶微、據余判斷、恐此兩層完全不能辦到、倘不能根據實際情形而加審察、則太平洋上之發展、唯有趨向於最猛惡之武裝衝突、而日本之野心、或將耗斁其財政、因迄今其財源全恃對於世界市場之貿易侵略、倘列强覓一方法、暫時制止其侵略、則日本祇將被迫較早尋一出路而已、</p>
<p>設今日俄先日美而開釁、則局勢將極端緊張、試問美國能容日本再度擊敗俄國乎、設一旦羅斯福總統助日以敵俄、則使俄將何如、至於他國、則英人將守其向來態度、雖寄同情於美、但以爲美人旣出而作戰、英人毋需加入、可局外旁觀、坐收漁人之利、惟英人爲其殖民地與對美基本同情起見、當然欲美國之獲勝、法國能度則不能若是坦直、苟在可能時、將較英人爲隱秘、此種情形、是否一悽慘景象耶、諸君旣欲余就直相而描寫、余雖不敏、至少當未戴一有色眼鏡、諺云、居於愚人之樂園無可得也、旨哉斯言、</p>
<p>美國迅將近一歷史上最嚴重之危局、而日本在其今日領袖者之下、亦屬無可勸說、欲求轉移此種局勢、祇有三途、（一）此時美國人民、勿復盧其本身之生存、而一任自然、（二）美國坦然變更政策給予日人檀香山以西之覇權、一如其所要求者、（三）美國亟起補救闕點、造成自已抵抗力量、而於此亦有三端焉、即「糾正」九二四年移民律内對於日本無謂之傷辱、給予日人極小之移民歲額（二）盡量發展英俄美之忠實合作、以制禦世界最近之威脅、（三）明告日本以美國之立塲及、其保持此立塲之准備是也、</p>

<h3>本市新聞李烈鈞昨接見記者　發表對時局意見　調解閩事必先揭止其發生原因</h3>
<p>遠東社云、閩事發生以後、中委李烈鈞氏、曾於日前致函蔣軍委長、對處置閩事曁開放政權等、有所建議、李氏兹已接得蔣氏覆函、内容不日即可正式發表、昨晨、李氏在其馬斯南路私邸、接見各報社記者、發表書面談話、謂近日報紙載余之意見、頗有未符者、此傳言之　也、閩事醖釀伊始、外間鮮有知者、及其宣言發出、組織人民政府、始明大概、有以閩事相詢者、余未及論其事、（中略）閩省獨立、留心國事者、咸抱分崩之痛、而於其所標示之開放黨禁、公開政權、則認爲法律政治所當然人民權利所應享、特並國旗亦改換之、未爲當耳、余對時局注重之點、在使内亂消弭、重歸於好重視人民智能與其應享之權利、故余恒主張解放人民言論出版集會結社諸束縛、使得自由組織政黨、發抒智能、實爲安内攘外之根本要着、國民黨勢力澎漲、與意志參差若此、亦無迫之使離、强之使合之必要矣、余於閩事遂希冀海内賢　、共圖和平、然深恐非俚言淺識所能生效、特爲倡耳、日前因致函各處、力陳其事、如此時福建不急於攻浙、中央亦不急於攻閩、則和平未始無望也、</p>
<h3>某中委　觀察閩變談話</h3>
<p>遠東社云閩事發生迄今已歷旬日中央於事變後、原擬就政治途徑、迅速解决、以免兵戎相見斵喪國家元氣、惟連日以來、閩方迄無覺悟表示、且袜馬厲兵大有犯浙之勢、政治解决與和平調處、事實上殆成絶望而在中央方面、爲維持威信起見、亦將授權軍事委員會委員長蔣中正以明令討伐、戡平亂域、遠東社記者、爲此、昨特往訪某中委、以此事之演進及其結果相詢、據談當閩事醖釀之初、本人曾建議中央、從速開放政權、（中略）、吾人須知政治不良、自然無法走上軌道、政治不上軌道、則糾紛叢起、已往政變、何募非此、閩變不過其中之一而已、且任何事變、必有其事變之源、善於應變者、唯在溯其源、而逐一分析明白、從客觀方面、加以考察、然後就主觀方面、加以處理、事未有不已者、若徒具主觀之我、而不見客觀之他如治絲焉愈理愈棼、故吾人認爲閩事之發生、與</p>
<h3>今後處置</h3>
<p>之道、亦當就此着手、若憑自我之見、甚或以情感之衝動而意氣用事、殊足僨事將見牽涉愈多終無法以善其後福建爲貧瘠之區、不及廣東二十之一、今旣組織獨立政府政費浩繁、非可以過去一省政府之政費可比、且十九路軍已往即須仰賴中央與廣東恊餉、據報載現已擴充至五軍之多、以如此貧瘠之省、一旦增加若斯之軍隊、則給養更無所自出閩事果不能就</p>
<h3>政治途徑</h3>
<p>解决十九路軍自非即行攻浙、求一條出路不可、而在中央爲維持威信起見、亦不能不加討伐若十九路軍進犯浙江、則戰事萬難倖免、兵連禍結、徒苦人民、斵喪國家元氣、吾人不能不引爲國家前途隱憂也爲今之計、本人認爲政治解决、尚未絶望所望雙方爲國家民族前途着想、屏絶私見開誠布公、從長計議、方於事有補、非然者吾不忍言矣云云</p>

<h3>標準美人的婚訛</h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>丨世上無如人欲險　遠期智者止流言丨</p>
<p>全國運動中的游泳唯一健將楊秀瓊女士，以前在南華游泳會中，屢稱水上無敵將軍，曾右「水怪的渾名；自得全運錦標，遂有「標準美的徽號，從此女士的一言一動，自有各報記者做伊的「起居注官」，可見「標準美人」的言行錄，自有非常的價值。誰料，最近香港某報傳出一人人稱怪的消息，便是「標準美人」將與一個年事在四十以外而常有胃疾的閩人陳向元結婚！「標準美人」而不能嫁一個標準丈夫，這是誰都要代爲不平的。後來，一經訪問，才知這是莫須有的事；然而，已夠着大家的奔走相告動色相語了。荀子說：「流言止於智者」，凡是一種無稽之言，往往容易流行，這是社會上缺乏理智的象徵。</p>
<p>陳向元，係香港廣西銀行的重要職員，和「標準美人」的父親楊柱南互相友善，陳君，係「標準美人」的父執，陳楊相稔，當然互相往來；且陳君自有夫人，絶無結婚的可能。某報披露楊陳結婚消息以後，報界中人都往訪問陳君，陳君力辯其事的烏有，且書一絶以表明眞相：「不憂穴耳與穿垣，市虎寗能擾夢魂？世上無如人欲險，還期智者止流言。」</p>
<p>「標準美人」爲著蜚語中傷，閱報以後，異常憤慨，聞已委託羅文錦律師控訴某報，將來如何水落石出？自有以後的事實證明。</p>
<p>「標準美人」是不怕風波的，泅泳池中屢得水上冠軍；但是，水面的風波不足怕，平地的風波郤可畏；有形的風波不足怕，無形的風波卻可慮；吾願戰勝風波的標準美人，還能勝戰這興波作浪的造謡惑衆之人。</p>
<h3>哀病菊</h3>
<p>— 清癯</p>
<p>從前龔自珍做一篇「病梅館記」，那批評家都說它含有革命思想，因爲「梅」本來照植物上的生機講起來，實在是很自由的；爲什麽要被園丁自幼紥翦，使一棵葱鬱直上，十分發達的枝幹，竟成屈折彎盤的枚枒，方才以爲可入目，稱爲奇古；這眞就使請那一位理論家去辨個是非，恐怕都說不出這公道來！難道同是有生機的物，植物類（科學家謂，植物有生機，無知覺，其實也不然，）應當被動物殘虐麽？（人爲倮蟲之長，則人本動物，並非異類，）所以吾照一位龔先生的意思去看現在的「秋菊」，雖是三徑羣中，繁英滿地，一般人悅志怡情，大加欣賞，而我的目中心中，好像有些可憐它的感想，不由得一時禁不住要對「菊」放聲長歎，唉！「菊」呀！你爲什麽身世的遭逢，竟這樣的苦啊！</p>
<p>「菊」的本性，原來像隱逸的一派，所以陶淵明愛「菊」如命就爲「人」和「菊」，大家好比知已一般，「菊」就是「人」，「人」就是「菊」，詩品上說得好，呌「人談如菊」，要曉得原爲這個緣故，並不是一句空談，從對面說，那末「菊」决不肯和不是陶淵明一流人相近，也就可想了；不過像現在的時代，那裏還有陶淵明，而「菊」還是騁着秋光，從西風瑟瑟的當兒，對人摇曳，放出像百折不磨的精神，開出許許多多的花朶來；「菊」的個性和本質，到底還是和陶淵明做過良友，他的志氣，骨幹，直到至今，是永遠不會變；唉丨儻然「菊」能說話，我不曉得要何等感慨，說一聲「物猶如此，人何不類，」可見「菊」雖是微末，在圓藝上一種點綴品，其實這一般人們的眼孔，像煞有介事去賞「菊」，眞不值「菊一」睬哩丨</p>
<p>我最不解「菊」是很自然的，偏要加以人爲去做矯揉造作的工夫，「爲嫌腰瘦扶籬竹，生怕苗長種瓦盆」，試想「菊」在這不自由的經過中，苟延在活，他的遭際，可算是備嘗艱苦，雖欲奮鬥，和以前東籬下享著田野間的快樂，從那裏可以得到呢？不夠，還要提他到廳事去，高高的擎在架子上，和壁角裏，堆得像山一樣，呌人去品紅題白，以爲肇錫嘉名，又像封建時代，分配列侯的權威，實則竟把「菊」和娼妓同類比觀，錯不多了；一到夜裏，還撥著電炬，照得花色光怪陸離，在猜拳拇戰聲裏，腸肥腦滿轟得「菊」也似泥醉，醒不轉來，你！想一想，「菊」生在現世，不像落在火坑裏，還算享着優游的自在麽！唉！「菊」呀！你受了病，没有替你作解放的呼號，你！爲什麽不自起來從陣圍中自已跳出呢？</p>
<h3>滿江紅哭浣姑</h3>
<p>— 顧飛</p>
<p>雁後霜前。多少事儘堪愁絶。一嚮是憑姑慰我。雙眉千結。豈料而今天壞隔。桃花潭水空嗚咽。問離魂遠未可歸來。重頭說。携手地。欄干折。連吟處。花還發。記分明相約。蘆邊看月。慧業人天無證果。焦琴弦斷高歌歇。只飄燈海角更誰知。腸摧裂。</p>
<h3>「香草美人」的敎育意義</h3>
<p>— 心純</p>
<p>在今日，電影之應成爲敎育民衆的利器，以完成其社會存在的價值，已經是無可非議的事了。</p>
<p>可是，所謂敎育，這一個含混籠統的名詞，我們應當怎樣確定它凖確的界說呢？這就是說：目前中國的民衆究竟需要怎樣的「敎育」？</p>
<p>中國是一個次殖民地的國家，一切政治上的，商業上的設施，没一處不受着帝國主義的牽掣；尤其是那殺人不見血的經濟侵略，它不但影響了中國民族資本發展的途徑，而且使中國廣大的勞苦羣衆也蒙着它的禍害。假如說電影應當怎樣敎育民衆的話，我想暴露帝國主義的猙獰的面目，這應當是最切要的題材了。</p>
<p>新近，明星影片公司將近公映的新片「香草美人」，就是企圖完成上述的使命的作品。</p>
<p>「香草美人」以一個香烟廠的木工王阿大爲主角，描寫他一家怎樣爲了生活而猙扎苦鬥：最先，阿大的弟弟，老婆，女兒，都在同一個香烟廠做工的，雖說生活很苦，但勉强也得温鮑了。不久這香烟廠受了外國烟商的傾軋，營業逐漸暗淡，老大的老婆及女兒都失了業；最後烟廠終於不能不被傾軋而倒閉，於是，阿大和他的弟弟也失了業。他的年壯力强的弟弟，並且因爲「鼓動罷工」的嫌疑被捕入獄。</p>
<p>王阿大失業以後，一家生計更苦。女兒爲了要吃飯，瞞着父親去做了按摩女郎。可是阿大終於知道了這事，於是和他的老婆女兒衝突起來，母女兩個竟負氣出走了。這應着，阿大的生活就完全陷在悲慘的境地。接着兒女生了病，終至生命無望。阿大如中風魔，獨自個茫茫然向街上走去，忽然看見一家外國香烟店的櫃窗，他恨極了，一拳揮去，搗毁了那櫃窗的陳設。於是，他竟因此犯罪入獄了。</p>
<p>從這故事裏看去，「香草美人」是明白地告訴了觀衆：（一）帝國主義的經濟侵略，足以使多數勞苦大衆陷入悲慘的運命。（二）生活問題不解决，是談不到什麽貞操的。</p>
<p>該片導演者爲陳鏗然，主角夏佩珍，謝雲卿，王徵信，現今已在公映了。祗有像這樣的影片，我敢相信它才是目前中國民衆所迫切需要的東西！</p>
<p>來函讀二十一日本欄有「針」短文一篇，係署名「傅紅蓼」者，頗爲有趣，按敝蓼久不執筆，今忽有同樣姓名發現，難免引起友輩誤會，更以不敢掠人之美，特此聲明，請爲注意！</p>

<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第十九回　欲卽欲離同車憶往事　半哭半笑倚枕病殘秋</p>
<p>自已心裏，也就同時悔恨着，這樣好的一個對手方，自已交臂失之，竟是讓趙自强當兵的人得了去了，這眞是可惜了。呀！他爲什麽掉過臉去，不向這邊望着？這就笑道：大姑娘，不抽根烟捲嗎？我身上帶着有呢。桂枝只好掉轉身來，摇摇頭道：我不會抽烟的，你不知道嗎？積之不料一句搭訕的話，說出來就讓人揭了底了，使道：有這：有這麽些個日子了，我忘了。桂枝道：那也應當忘了。他說這話時，眼看了自已的一雙鞋尖，聲音是非常的低　，積之側面看着，他臉上還帶了一些笑容。立刻想起往日同上乳茶舖，他那種又像親近，又像害臊的情形，復又呈現在眼前，雖然，初見面的時候，他的態度，是淡淡的，但是現在看來，也不見得他對人就是取那完全拒絶的樣子。看這情形，彼此的感情，也許可以恢復吧？心裏如此想時，眼望了他半邊臉，正看到他耳鬢之下，叢生着一片細細的毫毛，那正可以現出他的處女美來只看那白白的皮膚，粉膩了的𩓐子恨不得伸手過去，掏上他一下，只是當了許多人在座，怎樣敢造次呢？因之抽着手動了兩動，却又縮了回來靜止下來了。他這種舉動，恰是讓桂枝看到了，心裏這就警戒着，他怎樣可以在許多人面前動手動脚，於是把兩張面皮繃得緊緊地，作一個生氣的樣了。積之心裏，當然比他更曉得清楚，也就正了面孔，放出一種沉思事情的樣子來。車子走得很快，不久的時候，已經看到了西苑大營的高樓。（二五四）</p>
<p>小食譜</p>
<h3>花生米</h3>
<p>— 林瀅</p>
<p>花生米早又上市了。</p>
<p>花生米，這不待說明是花生的米子。這是中國人的通稱，但也有呌它做：花生豆，花生仁或呌做長生菓肉等各色各樣的徽號。這裏只是字面上的差異，其意義是相同的，實物也只是一種。卽花生丨丨長生菓，米，頭，仁，肉，所以等於花生米，花生豆，花生仁，長生菓肉。</p>
<p>花生的定名在中國人口語裏，我們分析起來，普通是有三種：花生，落花生，長生菓。花生米卽是這花生的本質，經過一次泡造過程而變相的花生。這製造的方法，普通大概有下列數種：</p>
<p>（一）焙製卽市上所售的乾花生米，椒鹽花生米或呌做椒鹽菓肉。北平還有一種上色（敷有洋紅）的花生米丨丨紅花生米，實際其味也不過如此。總之焙製的花生米茶食最宜。</p>
<p>（二）油炸油炸花生米。計分：帶皮的（通行長江一帶）及裸體的（通行平津一帶，上海也有，但是很少。）二種。（註·「皮」係指花生的裏皮）另外洒上鹽末，除茶食外，下酒最佳。一般人頗有以此作下酒用者。普遍老百姓們，買上三個銅板花生米，就可以大喝其白乾來。道有交代：名呌「怪酒不怪菜。」中國普羅的酒瘋之大衆，喝起酒來，大概如此。</p>
<p>（三）糖熬這裏花樣多了：最普通的是花生糖，可是，在花生糖裏面又有各種形式和性質的區别，的計當在百種以上；其中最常見的是牛奶花生糖，菱角形花生糖，方塊花生糖，花生糖條，花生軟糖……這裏名字太多，舉不勝舉。此外還有以花生作主要的或次要的原料而製成原食品，在名字上撇了這花生兩個字的也很多。囫圇的說一句：不計其數。由此，我們知道花生是食品中最普通而主要的原料，若干的食品中，它扮了重要的角色，更由此來推論，就不得不承認：花生，是食品中的大王。假如我們不吃什麽零食則已，一吃你就准可以碰見了它。</p>
<p>（四）鍊製Ａ花生酥Ｂ花生糕Ｃ花生粉等。除上述的以外，還有：鹽滷花生（有帶殼和去殼的二種）雨皮花生（仿製）和糖花生等。原殼花生，一般只有水煮和乾炒的二種。花生種類，有大小二種，大的肉實肥滿，小的（又稱，砂花生）味香且脆。在農産品中是僅次於米，麥，和豆類是大宗的出産。産量上佔農産品的大部份。每年出口的也不少，據民國二十一年海關出口往外洋貨品比較表來看，花生及其産品，佔全國出口品的百分之一點七六。中國是花生米産量最豐富的地方，尤其是在長江以北的各省區。</p>
<p>究竟花生這東西好吃嗎？你不要問；你旦去看：牙還没有脫完的老婆婆和老太爺，老爺和太太，少奶奶和少爺小姐，大姐和老媽子。老　與夥計，尤其是小弟弟和小妹妹等。其中有誰没有吃過花生米的呢？誰不喜歡吃它。</p>
<p>在書場裏，在茶館裏，甚至於在路上不有人把花生在津津地嚼着的嗎？</p>
<p>中國，是崇拜花生和瓜子的國家，在婚姻喜事中，把花生染紅了做「喜菓」是取它爲一種「吉利」的象徵，其餘如待客及作祭神用的供品，那更是尋常的事情。</p>

<p>貢獻話</p>
<h3>大家來打打算盤</h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>王雲五先生說：「什麽科學方法，什麽科學管理，總之是要請大家先來打打算盤」這話很有意味，尤其是辦國貨事業的，更要注意。原料怎樣採取？成本怎樣减輕，工人怎樣精選和減少？出品怎樣優良？營業怎樣可以和人競爭？銷路怎樣可以推廣？大家來打打算盤，便能有很好的結果。决不是糊裏糊塗，靠天吃飯，靠人吃飯，可以成事的。即如管理人事而論，也要大家用算盤子來搬動搬動，數目字來比較比較，怎樣使他們工作努力？怎樣使他們效能增進？無一不需從數目字上顯示出來。雲五先生說：「目下的時代，决不是用馬鞭管人，也不是用瞌頭管人，是用數字管人」。更是一針見血之談。</p>
<p>可是打算盤，不但要爲自已，還要替人家打算盤，目下國貨情形，處處有外貨來和我競爭。我們經營國貨事業的怎樣使價格便宜？適合國人的購買力？怎樣使質地堅美，比得上外貨？怎樣服務周到，應接謙和，使顧客滿意？聽說有一家商店，專用薪水便宜的店員，以爲减省開支，引爲得計，那知這班店員，没精打彩，得罪顧客，認爲常事，不高興起來，還替國貨做些反宣傳。結果於人無益，於已有損，這是打算盤打錯的結果。</p>
<p>國貨論壇</p>
<h3>國貨運動與合作制度</h3>
<p>— 偉中</p>
<p>提倡國貨必先從增加生産着手，差不多已成了一致的公論。然而我們這次殖民地的經濟地位，正匍匐呻吟於　際資本主義的鐵蹄下，冀落後的國貨業底抬頭，眞是談何容易？可是假使我們有縝密周詳的組織，果敢堅毅的精神應用現代的生産和科學的管理來從事發展産業，復興經濟，相信「鐵杵成針」，終許有功成的一天。下面我將介紹給從事和關心於國貨運動的同志們以一個適合國情的經濟組織，也是切實最有效的增加國貨生産的一個辦法。</p>
<p>生産制度誠然是目前一個最嚴重的問題，而爲我們所必需加以鄭重考慮的，資本主義制度已在歐美充分暴露了它的極端，矛盾和衝突的弱點；前車可鑒，我們不能再蹈覆轍，以免將來陷國家社會於可怕的局面之下。</p>
<p>合作制度，乃「人人爲我，我爲人人」建築於自由的互相了解上面。根據自助互助的原則，本平等精神，以共同參加一種産業的組織，而謀經濟上弱者相互間的經濟利益和興趣底增加。不以剥取利潤爲目的，不以鬭爭攘奪爲手叚，用和平的方法，從事合理的爲「消費而生産」的生産。實爲此刻最適合我國國情之一種生産制度。</p>
<p>合作組織中，無地位尊卑，人人有建議管理及監督執行之權。組織縝密，步驟穩健，不虞爲少數人舞弊；且人人爲基於共同之需要和興趣而參加，則結合出乎自動，有持久性；利害切於本身，有共通性；合作組織内之組合員，自能堅毅果敢，抱不屈不撓之精神，同心恊力做去，自非純粹以牟利爲目的的資本主義組織可比，其現代資本主義制度經濟組織下之許多斃害，自可避免。</p>
<p>增加生産，本爲第一條件，自不必說，惟在我國經濟衰敝已極的社會中，現存企業，亦已奄奄一息露出了苟延殘喘的氣象，更那裏談得上擴充和發展？同時又那裏去找尋資本來開天闢地，甸造我們的國貨企業？這裏合作制度就告訴了你：惟有用合作的方式，把各個小量的零星的欵項，集合到一個團體裏去。這不是一個很好的辦法麽？一個人的經濟力量是有限的，單薄的；可是集合許多有限，單薄的力量在一個團體裏，不就宏厚了麽？</p>
<p>没有團結的力量，宏厚的資本，怎樣去發展國貨業？怎麽去和外貨相抗衡？在這裏合作制度，又更爲切合適用於我們的國貨運動了。</p>
<p>國貨談話</p>
<h3>寫給服務國貨事業的人們</h3>
<p>— 肖白</p>
<p>因爲我國是生産落後的國家，所以，國貨事業，一直到現在，竟還不過算是尚在萌芽時代的一個襁褓小孩，雖然他的進展速度很快，年來在洋洋盈耳的提倡國貨聲中，他的生産額和銷售額，早有驚人的增加，蓬勃的新興工廠，旣似雨後春筍的增設，偉大完備的國貨公司，也早有巍然的成立，自然，這是全靠全國大衆的擁戴，各界努力提倡國貨的結晶，但，在另一方面，我們對於服務國貨事業的人們，却也不要忘了他們的心血經營，奔走努力，埋頭苦幹的功績，一爿廠往往是從極微小的資本，合着了極少數的職工，胼手胝足，慘澹經營，而奮鬥挣扎出來的，等到漸次擴充，而具有現下相當的地位，自然他中間早已犧牲了不少人們的血汗和腦汁，纔換得這一點珍貴的收穫，因此，我就想到了服務國貨事業者應具的幾個特質，就把他寫在下面，一方面果是希望作新興工業服務者之借鏡，一方面也就是勸已有成就之國貨工廠，他們的職工，仍須繼續努力，撫念已往創業之艱難，而益加奮勉之意。</p>
<p>（一）服務精神我記得上一期本刊裏，潘仰堯先生還在談起，假定在一個國貨企業的組織裏，他出品是好了，裝璜方面，也很美觀了，但是，他的店員們，缺乏服務精神，動輙得罪顧客，那麽，這樣的下去，他一定要受到營業上重大的打擊，自然敬業，樂業，我們總要有這樣的觀念，一個人服務社會，尤其是服務在社會下層組織，最切實最重要的國貨事業，我們更應如何發揮固有的能力，負起責任，奮發有爲，要曉得，國貨事業的抬　，就是社會工商的復興，那麽我們的抱定志願，努力職務，又何樂不爲呢！（二）忍耐心因爲國貨事業，他是完全要靠自已製造上的改進，以臻出品的精良，自然，拿血汗和心力來鍊鍜他的出品，這是不可避免的事實，那麽服務國貨事業的人，凡稍遇到一點辛勞時，就須以忍耐心去抵抗他，要曉得，現在的吃苦，眞是將來的成功，「簷水穿石」「鐵杵磨針」只要忍耐心的堅定，事業是没有不發展和成功的。（三）偉大的發展力服務普通企業的職工，往往以盡了自已本身的職務爲終結，其實，這種觀念是錯誤的，我們服務國貨事業的人們，就須努力改正，關於事業整個前途的興革，出品的改良，業務的擴展，工塲之設計，營業部份之設計，銷售與生産之比例與統計，社會情况，以及各地市面情形，人民對於本廠出品之需要如何？同業？</p>

<h3>國貨的敵人</h3>
<p>— 天然</p>
<p>國貨年中大家拚命提倡國貨，可是偏偏有國貨的敵人在各地作祟，恨無横磨之創，幸有温嶠之犀，寫出來給大家注意一下：</p>
<p>（一）改頭換面中國人眞聰明，明明是日本貨，他偏偏把他的招牌揭去，改了中國商商標，堂哉皇哉的當國貨出賣，結果驅了熱心國貨的同胞。這種人賺不名譽的錢，不知良心上怎樣對得起自已，對得起人家，一個人要賺錢方法很多，爲什麽東不做，西不做，偏偏做這種喪盡良心寡廉鮮恥的勾當。有位朋友說：「販日貨的朋友，他的不名譽，還不如小竊强盜。小竊偷物，還是偷偷摸摸，在黑夜裏工作，大盜刦物，還是用了本領，不失硬漢」。這種販日貨的人，其技尚在竊盜之下，最近有人報告說：某牌絨繩，不免有日貨嫌疑，吾們正在調查之中，如果眞的，罪該萬死。又有人報告，有幾家廠家，用了幾架小機，名爲出的國貨，暗裏是專把日貨來充作國貨出賣，我們也在調查，遲早終要把他揭發出來。</p>
<p>（二）得罪顧客做國貨事業，而得罪顧客，使顧客望望然去，或寗使去買洋貨的。這種店員，也是國貨之敵，應該鳴鼓而攻。</p>
<p>（三）貪便宜貪便宜的朋友，舍國貨不買而買洋貨，其罪與愛時髦的舍國貨不買而買洋貨者等。聽說有許多原料，中國都有，可是有種工廠舍國貨原料不買，而買劣貨，究竟是喪心病狂，還是貪便宜？</p>
<p>（四）太遷就方國民政府初成立時，很時髦的名詞，是「不妥恊」，可是現在太妥恊了，事事遷就，樣樣遷就，即國貨一綫生機的標明原産國條例，也要展期了，這展期，不是討好隣國，是和國貨作仇敵。</p>

<p>當我下筆寫「鄕村與國貨運動」一文的時候，本想把青年應怎樣到鄕村中去提倡國貨的幾種管見，寫在一起，但寫到後來，覺得篇幅已很長，字數也不少，所以便變更計劃，單把「鄕村與國貨軍動」寫成一篇文章，預備把怎樣到鄕村去提倡國貨，再寫一篇。可是「鄕村與國貨運動」刊出之後，接着便有李伯黍君介紹采橋的農民合作社，我除了對這種合作社表示同情之外，覺得另外還有些意見要在本刊發表一下。</p>
<p>鄕下的人，十九不識字，文盲居多，所以報紙宣傳，完全失效，如果要利用報紙，傳單，發表些宣傳和提倡國貨的文字，那完全是無效的。在鄕下，最有效的莫如口頭的宣傳，我們到鄕村去提倡國貨，第一步手續，就在對個人作談話，對羣衆則演講，說明種種中國人買洋貨所造成的危患，和洋貨侵入鄕村的危險。先要使鄕村中的農民，個個有愛用國貨，不願洋貨侵入的心理，然後再辦合作社，服務社，國貨小商店等各種事業。</p>
<p>如果一個鄕村之中，以人口的關係，或其他種種的阻力，而不能舉辦合作社一類的事業，那麽我們在根本方面着手，應當用種種的方法，指導農民，使農民能夠辨那一種是洋貨，那一種是仇貨，那一種是國貨，因爲有一部分的農民，他們本來不願去買洋貨，但他們不能辨出洋貨和國貨，所以雖想去買國貨，而結果是買到了洋貨或仇貨。我們雖是極力的宣傳，他們已有買國貨的决心，可是有時在商人欺騙之下，也會有洋貨侵入。所以蒐集洋貨，仇貨，國貨各種標本或樣品，使他們在比較之下，都能認識，也是一種重要的工作。</p>
<p>在鄕村中，我們嚴格的說來，除了極少數的外貨，由農民們直接到城市中去買來之外，大部分外貨的流入，是由於鄕鎭上的那些小商店去販賣的。所以我們不到鄕村去提倡國貨則已，如果要到鄕村去提倡國貨，那麽我們同時應去勸導這些小商店推銷純粹的國貨而勿銷外貨，如果那些小商店，大家不銷外貨之後，那麽鄕村中的外貨，就大半不能侵入了。</p>
<p>眼前在鄕下最不好的一種現象，就是一般的青年，在家鄕不到外面做事的人，一天到晚在家裏吃和睏，是專門的工作弄得不好，還要去賭錢和抽烟，大家能夠到鄕村中去做一些事情，而不到鄕村去。至於一般想到鄕村去的人，又因環境所迫而不能，結果便没有人到鄕村去負起那提倡國貨復興農村的使命。</p>
<p>然而我以爲那些鄕村敎師，在鄕村中敎書，課餘之閒，便應負起這些使命。他們人頭又熟，距離又近，如果去提倡國貨，不時的演講和勸導，效力一定比平常的人去宣傳來得有效。可是在鄕村中，那些小學敎師，又那裏能顧到這些問題啊！抱定不管閒事，一天課敎畢之後，便什麽事情也不去問了。</p>
<p>不要說小學敎師，就是那些民衆敎育館，和農民敎育館，在鄕下，也不都不能切實去工作，爲民衆或農民造福。如果民敎館和農敎館而切實到鄕村去提倡國貨，很有一些工作可做，像舉行國貨演講，蒐集國貨標本，編製洋貨侵入的統計表格，製作圖書標語，使一般的民衆，一般的農民，都能養成愛用國貨，仇視外貨的一種心理，才能收相當的效果呢！</p>
<p>貢献意見</p>
<h3>從自來水筆說起</h3>
<p>— 壽</p>
<p>從國貨公司購了枝價廉物美的國貨自來水筆歸來，扣在襟間，竟引起了同學的非笑。</p>
<p>「新購了自來水筆？ＸＸ牌，中國貨呀！」同時面部現出夷蔑的神情，意謂中國貨終歸　脚</p>
<p>「幹嗎？國貨不行嗎？」我有點不耐「哼！不用自來水筆則已，用了則須用來路貨，派克，康克令，又漂亮，又……」</p>
<p>我本想和他爭辯幾句，問問他是不是將來預備掮起復興國家家重責的新青年？但繼而見到他那副「無可理喻」的情態，便掉頭走了，於是Ｘ敎授的感慨系之的沉痛話，在我的意識中出現：「在中等以上學校的紙字簍内，尋不到半張中國紙！」</p>
<p>一國的興廢，可從青年學生的學舉止行動中覘到。如果要全國人民服用國貨；必須從學校内做卢。可是現代所謂「明日國家的主人翁」的學生呀，其盲目崇拜洋貨的心理竟如此濃烈！西裝當然最摩登，至少長衫料也該舶來品，布褂大衫，不被嗤爲「窮鬼」，也得尊稱聲「阿木林」。談話之間，夾幾句「洋涇浜」，才出風頭。即使書本子亦要挾厚厚的羊皮西書，以爲神氣。唉！智識階級的青年竟如此，國家前途，何堪設想？！</p>
<p>負有改革心理，指示迷徑的敎育家呀，請你們在高坐講席的時候，切實注意這嚴重的問題！</p>
<h3>談國貨文具</h3>
<p>— 玄萬</p>
<p>外人對於我們商業上的侵略，的確可謂無微不至了，大者自從米麥的食糧，棉織，呢絨的衣料，一宜到小小的文具，他竟無不使展他嚴密的手腕，以謀他市塲的獨佔，一方面他也正是候着了我國的社會情形，趁我們在這新舊交替的當兒，舊時代的毛筆，徽墨，在日漸淘汰，而鋼筆，墨水，却日見需要，在現下，無論辦公室中，學校敎室中，以及私人的家庭中，對於鋼筆，墨水，確有不可一刻無此君的概况，而每年在這外貨文具的輸入上，也就年年驚人的增加，國人自已又不會設法創造，來替代這類文具，所以，年來我國的文具，只有坐讓這些來路貨充斥了全國整個社會　　因此，國貨文具的創造問題，確實是我們現下從事國貨事業者最急需解决丨丨的問題，雖然，國貨墨水，民生墨水廠早有紅藍兩種墨水問世，但，鋼筆的桿和尖，恐怕一直没有國貨替代過，最近，潘仰堯先生等發起組織中南工業社，首先成就的就是這鋼筆筆桿，美觀，堅牢，遠勝舶來，業已發行問世，這是我們認爲滿足的，自慰的，也確是爲國貨年放一異彩，不過，以後我們還要希望他們能有自製的筆尖，使一枝鋼筆，能整個的都是國貨。</p>
<p>提倡舊文具，拒用新文具，這是已爲一般名流學者所提議過，我們對於這問題，雖不敢昧加評論，不過，總之要以需要而定，社會因時代之推進，及潮流之變換，文具的需用上，當然也要發生變化和改良，我們對於外貨的輸入，果屬痛心萬分，但，我們總應努力設計自製，有更好的出品來應付他，那纔是促進國貨文具及杜塞漏巵的正軌呢。</p>

<p>國貨雜談</p>
<h3>從印度婦女提倡土貨所得的感想</h3>
<p>— 非</p>
<p>從朋友處借了一本第二十八卷三號的東方雜誌，看到一第「印度婦女對英之不合作運動」，看了一遍，覺得慙愧無地了，因爲裏面記載的關於提倡土貨的事說：</p>
<p>「德里婦女之抵制進口疋頭與酒類糾察隊，組織完密，竟致令疋頭商自行將外貨封置一處，而以鑰匙交婦女委員會之手；立誓於政府與甘地成立諒解前决不出售外貨…………印度之銀行家，輸入商，跑合商，以及尋常商人，彼等向英倫商行報告，因婦女運動而斷决營業生機之電報，紛如雪片，大足警惕英人之膽，…………前德里疋頭恊會之書記，致英國孟哲斯德商會書記函，報告印度婦女運動之劇烈云：「在英屬印度任何地點，無論以何種價值，絶對無法出售一碼之外國布疋」……查英國一般入口貨銳减至百分之九十，而棉織品之完全一蹶不振者，純由孟買，加爾各答與其他各海港以至小村落，不斷的均有婦女糾察員之存在，零售商决不敢缶批發商購進英貨，蓋彼等深知此種貨物將無從出脫也，…」</p>
<p>看了上面的再回想到我們中國的抵貨運動，以及提倡國貨運動，能不　人慙愧無地嗎？亡國的婦女，在帝國主義者嚴酷的鐵蹄之下，爲了他們的民族，圖家寗原犧牲了自已，丨因爲他們這樣做是被認爲犯罪的，不顧一切的去幹丨而且在事實上他們是勝利了，但我們回頭看一看我們自主的中華民國呢？我們的抵貨運動，從五卅，五三，等直到現在，也不能算没有相當的歷史了！並且由抵制仇貨而仍以其他外貨替代的辦法，進步到抵制外貨同時提倡國貨了，更特特的定了今年爲國貨年，以資提倡，在表面上很夠，然而成績在那裏呢？我們的運動雖不曾停止，但在九一八以後進口額一度低落過的仇貨，却早恢復原狀了，親愛的同胞們，把這兩種成績比較一下，應作何感想！我們不要問别人，祇問一問你自已對於提倡國貨服用國貨做到了没有？我們不需要空言，我們所需要的是每個人皆是脚踏實地的去做，我們不能等外國人把我們的脂膏吸完了而死亡，我們應當用我們自家的力量求生路，同胞們醒！吧！</p>
<h3>國貨漫話禮力</h3>
<p>— 洽</p>
<p>俗例，人家逢有喜慶事，着人送禮，必有按照禮份開給禮力的舉動：普通多是以禮份作標凖，客客氣氣的在回片上寫明敬使若干。</p>
<p>是然，在酬應多的人家，禮力是僕役的外快，有時且超過正額薪工；然而，這數額還祇是禮份的十分之一，如果以此再作標凖，轉算主人家酬應面開支的數目，九九還回，可很可觀了。</p>
<p>在社會上，開門做生意的人本是將本求利，除去開支决没有嫌得對成的機會；然而，自從海禁大開以來，單這上海灘上，販賣舶來品而致富的人，豈非少數？那末，九九還原，從利推到本，輸送到别人家腰包去的東要，實在還不祇此一點小數而已！</p>
<p>告訴你吧！買舶來品的人得觸目驚心，經售的人也得自已醒悟，從洋貨而獲得的蠅頭微利，作用祇是力一般。看到禮力，便應該明白鉅額的禮份；拿到禮力，也應該認識得不償失！</p>
<h3>國貨運動法西斯蒂化</h3>
<p>— 枕木</p>
<p>今年是個國貨運動的國貨年，現在國貨年的時間，已去了十二分之九十，但是成績如何，是否有百分之七十五的服用國貨，當然，這是種超越理智的希望，但吾們也祇少要努力澈底的去提倡國貨，與服用國貨。在此記者要借重個時髦名詞，把國貨運動加以法西斯蒂化：所謂法西斯蒂化，乃是規律嚴格，手段潑辣，思想一貫，意志堅决的意思；要振興國貨，必須實行法西斯蒂化，至法西斯蒂化之實行，其基本之單位細胞，愈小愈好：兹分别舉述如左。</p>
<p>第一：家庭國貨法西斯蒂吾國社會的單位，不是個人，而是家庭，所以家庭可稱得最微細的單位，每一個家庭的主人，能領袖起來，强迫奬勵，嚴訂國貨服用條例，不怕洋貨之不能絶跡。</p>
<p>第二：商店國貨法西斯蒂商店，可以說是吾國家庭之外最多的團體在商店的店主，必須首先倡議，不准服用洋貨之店夥分拆紅利，因爲辛俸是各人勤勞的工資，紅利雖爲服務應得之酬資，但爲外快，不妨取消充公示罰，能如是則無患國貨之銷路不增。</p>
<p>第三：學校國貨法西斯蒂要是全國的大中小以及專門學校，能　除外貨，則每年外溢利權之挽回何止百十萬金；小學校由校長領袖，大中及專科學校，敎職員則由校長領袖，學生則由各班班長負責之，互相指導監督，一列服用國貨，盡力換置國貨用品，違者嚴賣。第四：機關國貨法西斯蒂機關職員，服務國政，爲民衆之表率，更宜爲國貨運動之先導，是當分局分科組織國貨法西斯蒂，以資提倡。</p>
<p>其他凡有三五人之氣投意合者，均可組織國貨法西斯蒂，决心服用國貨。最後，記者要說明國貨，法西斯蒂之單位細胞，可如上類分别組織，惟均須相互聯合起來，擴大範圍以增聲勢，庶乎貨物之審别偵查也得以精，而賞罰之證據手段也得以密，而有以望國貨服用之清一色，否則喉破音啞，儘吾儕拚命宣傳，大聲呼喊，其亦何補之有？故此：唯一的辦法，必須國貨運動法西斯蒂化！記着吧！吾們中華民國的愛國同胞！</p>
<h3>國貨漫筆</h3>
<p>— 嶙年</p>
<p>身上穿的是布製的旗袍，手指上戴了隻金鋼鑽的戒指，她是否是提倡儉約？還是提倡國貨？</p>
<p>都市裏的小姐奶奶，她們明知那件是舶來品而偏偏要買牠，鄕村裏的姑娘却盲從着，祇要買便宜貨，不管中國貨抑外國貨。</p>
<p>用國貨中最上品的呢絨來製西服，任你聲辯牠是國貨，總有人懷疑牠是外國貨。其實，你何必定要製西服？</p>
<p>與其倣造，不如自造，中國的廠家常喜歡影戤人家，所以國貨往往會失了人家的信仰。</p>
<p>有人說：「中國人祇有他的肉體是純粹國貨」。其實已不然，除了你活到現在絶對没有吃過外國的一絲食品，才敢承當一下。</p>
<p>某人調查過一位朋友：在小學時國貨佔全身十分之五，在中學佔十分之二，進了大學，國貨就此告絶。這是學齡與崇外的心理俱進的一個表現。</p>
<p>現在一般青年所寫的情書，似乎非用派克或康克林的鋼筆在厚道林印的信紙上寫，就是落伍，於是在幾聲「哥哥」「妹妹」中，金錢的漏巵，已爲數可驚。然而這種惡習慣，祇要任何一方對對方表示「非用國貨紙張通信，概不答覆」來要挾一下，包管毛病就此醫好。</p>
<h3>布蔬齋隨筆</h3>
<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>測騐</p>
<p>在社會上跑跑的人，十有九個是吸着香烟的，倘使摇着頭說不會吃，那眞是鳳毛嶙角，絶無僅有的了。好在現在國貨的香烟，像兩後春筍般出來，足以供求相應。要是我們完全吸舶來品，金錢的流出，比隨便甚麽都利害呢！</p>
<p>我們的李先生，漂亮的西裝：流利的英語，眞是一個十足的摩登青年。他吸的香烟，當然也是最高貴的舶來品。他走到别處地方，逢着人家敬他香烟，他吸了幾口，必定看看這烟掷上印着的牌了。倘使是舶來品，不管烟質的優劣，一氣吸到底。要是中國貨，不管是白金龍和美麗牌，他總縐着眉說一聲：「燥！燥！味道不好。」隨後向痰盂裏一丢。人家當面也不好去批駁，背後總譏笑他是奴化，連吃香烟也只重皮毛，不求實在。</p>
<p>有一天，他的幾個朋友，選了好幾種上等香烟，把牌子統統抺去，内中舶來品和國貨各佔其半。向着李先生說道：「你是吃慣上等香烟的；也是崇拜洋貨的。這有幾種香烟，請你每種吸幾口。辨别那一種質地優良，烟味和醇；那一種品性燥烈，不合衛生。」他連說：「好！好！那有辨不出的道理來！」他先把各烟的烟絲，寗視了一回；然後吸了一口，說：「這是國貨，味道燥烈；這也和前者差不多。」末後拈了一枝，邊吸邊說：這不是茄立克，定是白錫包。衆人檢視了一回，原來他所稱讚的，便是國貨的白金龍。他所詆毁的，便是日常吸慣的舶來品。於是大衆撫掌，而李先生竟然口都開不出。總算他從善如流，從此再不吸舶來品的香烟了。</p>
<p>從這次的試騐，我們便知道有許多國貨，並不退板，不過因了人們的不信任，於是銷路不佳，因之失敗。所以提倡國貨，一方固由於企業家的努力；一方也須大衆們擁護。</p>
<p>我從前做了一首勸人戒香烟歌，不妨寫在下面：</p>
<p>涓涓不塞，將成江河。莫道數少，積少成多。一枝淡巴，無異利戈，吸吾膏血；增我病疴。能戒則戒，毋再蹉跎！</p>
<p>國貨烟公司裏的老間，見了一定要不答應，說：「你勸人戒香烟，未免於吾們營業有關。」於是再做一首勸人吸國貨香烟歌在下面：</p>
<p>香烟啣在口，大步向前走。氣昻昻；雄糾糾。旁人讚你何抖擻？國貨香烟吸之久。</p>
<p>文人下筆遲，香烟助文思。工人邪許罷，香烟舒四肢。勸君莫吸外國貨，記取外艦砲轟時。</p>
<p>好了，上面的一首歌，和前邊的許多文宇，總算盡力在提倡國貨。不過我以爲香烟一物，多吸不如少吸；少吸不如不吸。倘若一定要吸，你吸一枝舶來品，還是勸你吸二枝國貨的好。</p>
<h3>國貨小說不亦快哉</h3>
<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>這是一個奇物的宴會，因爲在座十幾位賓客，却有各式各樣的人物。酒到半酣，也不豁拳，也不招妓，新式的主賓，偏要行那陳年宿古董的酒令。</p>
<p>令官先開口道：「我的酒令，是請各人按着自已的身份，說着各人所做的事，殿以「不亦快哉」四字，而且還暗寓着提倡國貨的意思，佳者各人陪飲一杯，不合的罰他三大白。」</p>
<p>座中有一個軍人，他性子最急，站起來說道：好！好！我來先說：</p>
<p>「練習飛簷走壁的本領，組織了大刀隊，殺本國人民，不亦快哉！」</p>
<p>衆人聽了，個個哈哈大笑，連說「該罰該罰，你殺戮本國人民，算提倡國貨，是國成立後的同室操戈，豈不變了國貨展覽會嗎？罰！罰！」</p>
<p>接着一位紈挎子說道：</p>
<p>「喝紹興酒，玩揚州姑娘，跳八佾舞，不亦快哉！」</p>
<p>令官評判道：「喝酒嫖娼，提倡國貨，還說得過去，請問八佾舞怎樣跳法？對手方是誰？顯見是全本扯謊，該罰該罰。」</p>
<p>一位學生說道：</p>
<p>「讀中國書，寫中國字，做中國文章，研究中國學術，不亦快哉！」</p>
<p>衆人又評判道：「從表面看來，這話是對的，但學術不限中西，不分畛　，集人之長，補已之短，那纔正理。閉門造車，未免不合時勢，也該罰酒。」</p>
<p>接着是一位意氣揚揚，滿面笑容的商人說道：</p>
<p>「販賣中國貨，賺中國人銅錢，不亦快哉！」</p>
<p>衆人都各點頭，說他很有良心。不過那位學生却不服氣，站起來說道：「他謙中國人銅錢，却已做到了。說販賣中國貨，有些靠不住，不要又要又是改頭換面的冒牌貨嗎？」那商人聽了他的話，不禁面耳都紅起來。</p>
<p>接着有政客，敎員，宗敎家，工人，記者，都說了些普通的話，也有好的，也有罰酒的。末了挨着那位土氣十足的鄕下老，他一定不肯說，衆人强逼着他，不得已站起來說道：</p>
<p>「自耕田，自織而，吃的，穿的，都是國貨，不亦快哉！」</p>
<p>衆人聽了，一齊鼓掌，連喊好！好！眞的提倡國貨的人　，只有你們鄕下人了！</p>

<h3>打倒近視</h3>
<p>— 老舍</p>
<p>人類大概是退化了。堯舜禹湯俱不戴眼鏡，而我則近視之中帶着散光，不戴眼鏡則宇宙樸糊，曲線之美失其美！巴黎女子有將眞眉剃去，另畫一雙者，是天然之眉生得不盡合人意。我非女性，尚不敢剃眉再畫，畫眉問題即不細加研究。可是一提到眼鏡，總不免悲觀！原始之人，鑽木取火，未聞錯鑽了手指，而現代近視之流，往往鎖門連同鼻子鎖上。人類大概是退化了。</p>
<p>近視實非微小問題。其有關於經濟者，如正在没錢之時，耳揷或鼻架忽然破碎。用蔴繩繫上則大殺風景，到公司去配則現錢交易難以履行，終日雙手捧鏡則别的都不能幹，乾脆不戴則天旋地轉，如何是好？甚或引起自殺之念！</p>
<p>友人王君，覺有結婚的必要，乃去自相自看。有女如花，一見成功。娶到來中，原來面上麻子甚多。因惱生恨，王君遂墮樓而死。他也是近視喲！</p>
<p>友人李君，事闊錢多，鼻托玳瑁鏡架，標凖美男子也。結婚之夕，摘了眼鏡，兩眼如死魚，大而無當，離裏離光。次日，夫人提起離婚。李君乃入山爲僧友人張君，錯吻了小姨，亦近視之害也。</p>
<p>諸如此類，難以盡述。總而言之，近視理當打倒，而眼鏡乃現代文明之咒詛。爲今之計，宜將害目之工作，如讓書，如寫小楷，如刻字，如剌綉，如看電影，一律禁止。庶幾乎人無近視，而天下太平矣。</p>
<h3>湯顯祖及其還魂記</h3>
<p>— 何如</p>
<p>湯顯祖是明代第一個偉大的傳奇作家，他也兼能作詩作古文。有人勸他講學，他說；一諸公所講者性，僕所言者情。」論文以宋濂爲宗，斥李夢陽王世貞之文爲僞體。又嘗告人：「以舉業之耗，道學之牽，不得一意横絶流暢於文賦律吕之事。」好像深自歎惜。可見他於當時氣燄最盛的假道學家，僞古典派，以及士子必習的八股文，都抱着不滿，或反抗的態度。他酷唔元人雜劇，收藏不下千　本，每本佳處能够一一口誦出來，原來這位天才的傳奇作者也是由苦功得來的。所作傳奇有玉茗堂四夢，還魂記爲四夢之一，尤有名。雜劇有西廂記，傳奇有還魂記，小說有紅樓夢，這在中國描寫才子佳人的文學中都算是登峯造極之作。</p>
<p>還魂記一名牡丹亭，以柳夢梅杜麗娘一男一女爲主人公，寫他們生死戀愛的悲喜劇。柳春卿因一日夢見園中梅樹下有一個妙齡美人向他招呼，就改名夢梅。杜麗娘爲南安太守杜寶之女，在一個春日，遊覽花園，見百花爛漫，衆鳥喈喈，不覺觸動懷春之情，倦極而睡。夢見一個書生，手弄柳枝，來到牡丹亭畔，芍藥欄前，以巧言相誘幽會。旣而夢破人亡，一切俱幻。但麗娘傷春之情更不自禁，明日再獨往花園，追尋夢跡，只見一株梅樹，因念死後願葬此樹之下，不覺泣下沾襟。從此日夜沉思，容顔消瘦，寫眞題詩，以寄所懷，有「他年得傍蟾宫客，不在梅邊在柳邊」之句。臨終時候，她遺囑須葬後園梅樹之下。並以自畫像藏庭中太湖石底。恰巧此時杜寶陞爲安撫使，轉任揚州而去。後來柳夢梅以應試路過南安，病倒風雪中，幸賴杜太守家留守的老秀才陳最良瞥見扶救，養病於奉祀麗娘的梅花觀中。一日柳生病稍愈，出後園遊玩，偶於築山的石間，見一小匣藏有美人寫眞，携歸供奉。後來麗娘鬼魂出現，和他相聚，誓爲夫婦。他開了麗娘的棺，麗娘復生，兩人同居一起，擬向揚州進發，得到家庭准予締婚的許可。夢梅因先赴京應試。遇着兵亂，金國大兵南下，利用土宼李全擾亂江淮，杜安撫適當防衛之任。待亂平後夢梅已中狀元，帶了麗娘和她父母相見。全劇便結局於這種意外的遭遇裏。</p>
<p>據說此劇初成，卽在玉茗堂試演，没有人賞識他的好處。所以作者有七夕答友人詩說：</p>
<p>玉茗堂開春翠屏，新詞傳唱牡丹亭。</p>
<p>傷心拍遍無人會，自搯檀痕敎小伶。</p>
<p>待到婁江王相國錫爵呌家樂搬演，纔加讚賞。且說：「吾老年人，近頗爲此曲惆悵。」從此牡丹亭流行於世。又有婁江女子俞二娘酷嗜其詞，斷腸而死。所以作者有哭婁江女子一詩道：</p>
<p>畫燭摇金閣，眞珠泣繡窗。</p>
<p>如何傷此曲，偏只在婁江！</p>
<p>相傳杭州女伶商小玲以色藝見精，於還魂記尤　擅場。她因失戀而鬱鬱成疾，每演杜麗娘尋夢閙殤諸齣，好像親歷其境，纒綿凄婉，滿面涙痕。卒因演尋夢一齣，唱到傷心的句子氣絶而死。還有内江一女子，以才色自矜，讀了還魂記，便想嫁於湯顯祖，湯辭以年老，一日，湯正宴客西湖，這女子尋去看望他，果然是一老翁，不覺失望，投水而死。又有揚州女史金鳳鈿，寄書於湯，願爲才子婦」。竟因答書遲來，單戀而死，遺囑須以還魂記一部殉葬。後來湯氏因感激知已，爲她營葬，並廬墓月餘而去。再，西湖女子馮小青有讀牡丹亭一詩道：</p>
<p>冷雨幽窗不可聽，挑燈閒看牡丹亭。</p>
<p>人間亦有痴於我，豈獨傷心是小青！</p>
<p>可見此劇一經流合，就風魔了不少的痴情女子。向來爲禮敎所壓抑的男女之欲，誰都正若無法宣洩。一旦有人以以深情所至，夢而可以滿足願望，死而可以還魂復生，用戲曲的形式具體地客觀地表現出來，足使一般痴情的讀者看客，尤其是怨女，平日受著壓抑作用，鬱積糾結在自已内生活的深處那精神的傷害，悲痛苦悶的感情，到了這絶對自由的創造生活的瞬間，卽藝術欣當的瞬間，便被解放而宣洩於意識的表面，而生出悲劇的快感來。惝若相信希臘古代哲學家亞里士多德詩學上所說悲劇的凈化作用，以及近來歐洲精神分析學者所說宣洩濳意識裡精神傷害的醫治瘋狂法，還魂記所以在剛剛出來的時候，能够轟動一時，能够風魔一般少年男女，自然是有些理由可說，何况才子佳人原是當時社會裡支配階級理想的男女，還魂記描寫才子佳人的戀愛，生死夢幻，任意安排，彌補了人間不可能的缺憾，正是享盡了人間可能的幸福的支配階級所幻想所追求的。所以還魂記一出，家傳户誦，幾使西廂减價，雖然有人譏評不合曲譜，用韻任意，却都不成爲盛名之累。至於詞句工麗，才情　富，原是當時支配階級所需要的，因爲只有這樣高貴的戲曲文學，纔和他們有了優裕的生活，有了相當的敎養相適應。這也是還魂記所以盛行一時的原因罷。</p>
<h3>老農夫</h3>
<p>— 李輝英</p>
<p>昔日的一個老農夫，想不到在吉林的街頭遇到了他。</p>
<p>五年前，我們原是住在一個屯子裏的。他一家十幾口人，什麽兒子，姑娘，媳婦，孫兒全不缺少。種楊家十垧地，一家人賴以糊口，雖然那時的日子，就夠難過了，可是他一家人靠着成年不息的勞動，總算還没有挨過餓。</p>
<p>是的，在吉林街頭能夠見到他，是想不到的，那是有着一種來歷。五年以前，他殷實敎子的信條，是「不要上兩城去」丨東城吉林，西城長春。自已家年出幾十石糧，頂多不過拉到三十里外的岔路河集上賣賣就完了，再不肯像别的人家，駕車拉到城裏去賣，寗可少賣幾個錢，也不那樣幹。他最怕人到了城裏學回來一身壞毛病。城裏，聽說是個極容易使人學壞的大陷坑。他不是單純的限制家人們進城，自已同時也以身作則的，成年到頭困守在屯子裏。</p>
<p>可是現在他當眞的進城來了，而且還作了乞丐，這眞是使我在想像不到之外，還添上一重驚異，驚異到他生活的變遷，會走得這般的快。</p>
<p>他苦苦地跟着我要錢，這才使我在一種方便中認出他來，我問他：</p>
<p>「馬二爺，（我還是像從前那樣稱呼他）你怎麽不在屯裏種地呢？」</p>
<p>彼此都認識了，他也就不以身分拘束他自已了，回答着：</p>
<p>「唉！一言難盡！」</p>
<p>唉那麽一聲，我就看出他臉上的皺紋深深地顯了一下，而在他乾枯的昏花的老眼中，彷彿冒出來幾點帶亮的水珠。接着，他又說：</p>
<p>「唆！這年頭，不要說我這樣家破人亡的人，不能回屯裏去種地，就是有家有地的人家，你問他，他也不那樣說呢。他要說，旣然城裏有一碗稀飯喝，誰願意回屯裏去種地呢。」</p>
<p>他說他家破人亡？我便同他：</p>
<p>「怎麽，二爺，你的家？」</p>
<p>「家麽？你還不知道麽？去年，被日本飛機抛炸彈炸完了，人炸死了，東西燒光了，就只逃出我這老不死的廢物」</p>
<p>自然我是知道那樣事情的，又是日本人的施惠，施惠到他身上，不，施惠到好多人們的身上。本來近幾年人們的生活就夠困苦了，如今連在困苦中吃飯的餘地都給搶去了，日本帝國主義只管把他們往死亡綫上追趕着，我再問他那下半句話，我覺得「不原回屯種地」的話，出自農人口中，，多少是驚人的：</p>
<p>「你說旣然城裏有一碗稀飯喝，也不願回屯去種地，那是什麽緣故？</p>
<p>「！唉」他又唉了一聲，心裏像充滿着說不出的哀怨，「我跟你說，糧實種到地裏，化錢，費工，連剷帶犂，剛好差不多，莊稼長挺好的，打起來了，日本兵說打胡子，胡子說是義勇軍，要打日本兵，打罷，打來打去莊　人遭殃，莊稼，房子都打完了。要住的没有住的，要吃的没有吃的，就等着餓死，就是你也不願回屯，幹那優事呀！南荒裏，聽說今年荒出兩千多垧地没有人種呢！</p>
<p>他說完，有些惋惜而又憤慨的樣子。我點點頭，明白他是受了什麽害。不過我就想，城裏的「一碗稀飯，」眞是好討麽？街上求乞的人比從前不知多子多少倍，城裏又何嘗是安身之地！</p>
<p>我再要問他一點話，從旁街鑽出了一個跨刀的警察，嚇得他急急地溜開了，也没有顧得向我討錢。一個敦厚純樸的鄕間農夫，從困苦的生活中，也能熟習了城市的規矩，大概他是吃過警察們的虧罷。</p>
<h3>小諷剌</h3>
<p>— 梭羅古勃作　侍桁譯</p>
<p>（二）平等</p>
<p>一個大魚捉到了一個小魚，想吞吃了他。</p>
<p>小魚嘶呌起來：「這是不公平的，我也要生存。在法律之前所有的魚都是平等的。」</p>
<p>大魚回答道；「什麽事呀？我不想討論我們是否是公平，但如果你不要我吃了你，那麽如果你能夠的話，請你就吞了我吧丨丨你吞吧，不要怕，我不和你抵抗。」</p>
<p>小魚張開了嘴，突出來想要吃大魚，可是最後嘆了一口氣說：「你對了。吞了我們吧。」</p>
<h3>兩兄弟（四十四）</h3>
<p>— 莫泊桑著　李維克譯</p>
<p>啊，懊悔！懊悔！以前，在剛才失身的時候，她定曾懊悔過，但隨後便没有這回事了。不錯，她曾爲她的過錯哭過，但慢慢地，她便差不多把它忘記了。所有的女人，不都有着這種驚人的遺忘力，使她們在幾年之後，便把曾吻過自已的嘴和全身的男子都幾乎忘記了嗎？接吻好比霹一樣打擊着，愛情好比暴風雨一樣消逝了，隨後，生活又像天空一樣歸於寗靜，於是又再開始以前那套把戲，人們誰會記起一團雲來呢？</p>
<p>筆爾再不能住在他的房間内。這座房子，他父親的房子，簡直把他壓壞了，他覺得屋頂壓在他頭上，四壁使得他窒悶。因爲非常口渴的緣故，他點燃了蠟燭，想到廚房裏沙濾缸旁去喝一杯凉水。</p>
<p>他跑下了兩層樓，隨後，他拿着一滿瓶凉水上來時，她穿着睡衣坐在那有空氣流通着的一級扶梯上，他不用杯子，就凑着水瓶大口的喝着，好像一個氣急着的賽跑者一樣。當他停着不動時，這屋子裏的沈默使他瞿然；隨後，一樣一樣地，他把這屋裏最細微的聲音都分辨出來了。最初聽出來的是飯廳裏的時鐘，他覺得那擺聲在一秒一秒地大了起來。隨後他又聽到了一種鼾聲，一種老年人的，短促的，辛苦而又勵害的鼾聲，無疑的這是他父親的鼾聲；於是他又爲一個突然發生的念頭所苦，他想同在這屋子裏打鼾的這兩個人，父親和兒子，彼此是毫不相干的！没有任何關係結合着他們，連最輕微的關係都没有，而他們却不知道這事！他們彼此親親熱熱地談話，他們抱吻着，他們對於同一事物一齊覺着欣快或感動，好像他們的脈管裏循流着同一的血液似的。其實呢，兩個生在地球的兩極的人，彼此的關係，也不會比這父親和這兒子的更遠，因爲有一個謊在他們身上長大了，所以他們以爲彼此相愛。就是這一個謊使他們發生慈與孝，一個不能揭穿的，並且除開他，丨眞的兒子以外，誰都不會知道的謊。</p>
<p>然而，然而，假使他猜錯了呢？他怎麽知道這事呢啊！如果他父親和哲安兩人裡　有一個相似的地方，有一個那種從高祖到曾孫的表示整個苗裔都是從同一接吻直接傳下來的，神秘的相似的地方，那就好了。在他這醫生的眼中，祇要稍爲有點相似，便可以看出來的，穎骨的形狀，鼻的弧線，兩眼的距離，齒和毛的式樣，更微細一點如一個手勢，一種習慣，一個姿勢，一種遣傳的趣味，由一雙有經騐的眼睛看出來的某種特記等等都行。</p>

<h3>必也正名</h3>
<p>— 韋拔</p>
<p>詈人曰竊，偷，人之所大惡也。苟犯之，則必勃然大怒，捋臂相向矣。然而入電車，給了銅子，並不給票，賣票者笑嘻嘻曰，「先生，對不起！」於是乘客心會，報以微笑，而銅板落夾袋矣。是不曰「偷」，名爲「揩油」。</p>
<p>揩油之道，亦多矣哉！上自國庫司理，下至家中所雇老媽子·凡有油處，莫不可揩，其名雅馴，搢紳先生類能言之。</p>
<p>夫「偷」曰「小偷」，「小竊」，以此奉人，人不樂受，然而易其名曰「揩油」，則大庭廣衆之同，言之無慚色矣，厥功豈不偉歟？</p>
<p>韋拔生曰：「是名之不可不正也乎？是名之不可不正也乎？」</p>
<p>孔子稱「名不正，則言不順；言不順，則事不成：事不成，則禮樂不興；禮樂不興，則刑罰不中，刑罰不中，則民無所措手足，」他老人家故筆削　秋，而亂臣賊子懼，這事情原是，「古已有之」的，特今日運用得更廣一點吧！</p>
<p>今之詆人，必曰「十大罪狀」，而後我之爲「十全老人」，蓋無疑矣。由是心安理得，夜裏睡得着，日間亦無所愧怍了。</p>
<p>凡此種種，都是「正名」的應用，而有合於孔老夫子的「微言大義」的，其利甚漙。他如吃敗仗曰「縮短戰線」，不抵抗曰「誘敵深入」等等，舉一反三，是在讀者。</p>
<h3>矛盾</h3>
<p>— 淑賢</p>
<p>在，　　　早六點　的時候，　　也　　　　　　　陌生面孔的工人之中一丨皮　　大着血口似的鐵欄門吞了進去。她現在已是騐紗間内的一個騐紗的女工了。這破題兒第一的新生活的開始，還是她三舅在上禮拜六請「拿摩温吃　的結果。她的工作是將摇紗間女工摇好了的紗絞，拿來檢騐，看看有　啥格毛病」，要是騐出了毛病，那摇紗的女工就得罰工錢，各樣毛病的罰工，都有一定的規定。</p>
<p>她們共有六個人，園坐在一張騐紗桌子旁，每人的右手邊放着一個麻袋，麻袋裏面裝滿着的盡是摇好的紗絞。銀妹隨手在麻袋裏拿出第一個紗絞套上騐紗架，低着頭慢慢地數着紗的根數及吹求着裏面的各種毛病，遇到有一項，就用鉛筆記在罰欵軍上。</p>
<p>……一角……五角，……五分。第一個紗絞騐好了，加一加各項罰欵的總數，得出二元八角。她驚駭得幾乎掉下了鉛筆，她懷疑是自已算錯了，再算一次，還是得的二元八角，這眞把她弄到莫明其妙。她想：「也許摇紗女工的工鈿很大，就是罰上兩三塊錢並不算事吧」！好奇心的驅使，她終於鼓起了勇氣輕輕地問一問坐在左邊的那個。</p>
<p>「摇紗女工每天到底能賺多少銅鈿？」</p>
<p>「三四角。」</p>
<p>這簡單的回答幾乎使她喊了出來。她默在肚子裏一算：「一天三四角·十天三四塊，假使半個月内　　　二元八來牠兩三回，不但這十天的工完全要算白做了，還須從自已家裏帶錢來賠呢！如果自已是摇紗女工的話，又將如何？」她拿着鉛筆只管呆呆地想着，不提防「拍」的一聲，背上早被人拍了一下，一切的念頭都被這異外的打擊飛去了九霄！趕忙回過頭來，穿着工廠制服的領班先生直挺挺地正站在她的背後，一聲不嚮地死用兩隻發光的眼睛將她射住。她的内心一跳，從新迅速回過頭去，急急地在罰欵單上共計洋欄内畫上一個「二」，小數點「八」的阿拉伯字，手是戰得非常利害。</p>
<p>她偷看坐在旁邊的騐紗女工，好像没有一點事似的在一張張罰欵單上共計洋欄内只是寫上許多「二元，三元，三元六角……」等不同的數目，她眞懷疑她們的良心是「墨」做的。</p>
<p>銀妹受着良心的譴責，唯一的辦法只有對於檢騐上馬虎一點，可是不上三天即被好滑的領班先生發覺了，幸得全體騐紗女工的講情，到底領班先生看了她們其中一個最漂亮的女工的面子没有將她開除，僅只罰了兩塊錢了</p>
<p>一個禮拜的工作如再没有勇氣做下去，她覺得自已現任本　　　工人　　還要被動地去　罰其他的工人的工資，這種出賣自已的同類去討飯吃的行爲，她是一百二十分地不願意。可是一想到人家都已穿上了絨線衫，自已還是穿的一件破夾襖，鞋子再過一個禮拜就會現出脚趾頭，而且飯店裏的伙食如何設法？以後又到什麽地方去吃飯？……等，這許多的問題使她無法解决，如是她的内心整天被這些「？」符號當作了戰塲。</p>
<p>這是銀妹自進紗廠以來第十天的黃昏時候，天下着大雨，可伯的狂風拚命在咆哮，她和三個騐紗女工一同放工回家，互相緊靠着，一步一步地向前趨進，當她們剛走到一條小浜的木橋邊時，劈頭被三四個穿藍布短衫的彪形大漢和幾個手裏還提着飯盒的紗廠女工攔住了去路。</p>
<p>「Ｘ你媽媽！跑到什麽地方去？」粗暴的江北口音蔣她們同時嚇住了脚。</p>
<p>「這幾隻都是我們廠裏騐紗間的爛臭Ｘ，一個給她一頓生活再說吧！」幾個女的都不約而同地大聲喊着。</p>
<p>三四個大漢像捉小鷄似的每人隨便抓住了一個。</p>
<p>「拍！」銀妹的臉上早吃了一記耳光。半邊在發着火燒。</p>
<p>「有話好說，不必動手吧！」銀妹還很驕傲地反抗。</p>
<p>「Ｘ你媽媽！自已還不明白嗎？在廠裏你們罰的好工錢，我妹子一個月九塊錢的工錢都被你們罰光了！」</p>
<p>「乒！」「乒！」接着腰上又來了兩下。</p>
<p>「不！你錯了！不是我們自已願意罰的，而且我……」銀妹還想辯護。</p>
<p>「不准說，這塊有你說的嗎？」</p>
<p>「乒」，「乒」！</p>
<p>「拍」，「拍」！</p>
<p>她們先前還都在狂喊，狂喊過後只是發着可怕的呌聲，喉音漸漸呌嘶了！再只聽到她們急促的呼吸和無力的呻吟。</p>
<p>「乒乒」！「乒乒」！四個人都被去進小浜的污泥裏。幾個大漢和女工的影子這時也都在這狂風暴雨的黑暗中悄悄地消失了！</p>
<h3>愴痛的心</h3>
<p>— 烈火</p>
<p>一個月以來，我就儼然走失了靈魂似的：日間是心兒忐忑，坐也不是，行也不是，想看點書，就好像書上的字是一管一管的利箭，狠毒的針着我的胸膛，於是不由你不把它擁開：提起筆來，心兒是更慌張了，寫什麽呢？簡直一個字都寫不出來。夜間，同樣是不安的，也許更要慌亂，不是上半夜臨床就失眠，就是下半夜眼巴巴的望着天窗發白。在這裏，略略較爲適意的，便是去　馬路，去找朋友談天。然而，事後也就必然，慌亂的心更要加重一幕「空虚」的襲擊，於是「這」我也就怕了。</p>
<p>是十四的深夜，我捧着父親的信，去到荒凉凄清的滬北的一個同鄕家裏拿錢，在零落而黯淡的電光下，野狗的狂吠聲中，摸索，摸索，兜了好幾個圈兒才找到，結果又是那麽失望。轉來，我坐上床沿，我又掏出父親的信，在涙眼朦朧中我只瞪着這些句子：「爾何時始得歸來？雖望之，亦不勉！」落尾又這樣的批着：「趁早歸來，以慰余望！」這夜我是没曾闔上過一刻鐘的眼，更開始感受心的愴痛！當我今年正月裏重上征途的别家時，父親灑着老涙對我說：「我也不以我的病老，强留你在家裏，斷送你的美麗的夢！若是，若是……就寫個信告你好了，也不用你回來，你也不會回來！是那麽樣遠，更要那麽多的路費！」當是我不知道要怎樣回答，只是以眼涙來作代表。我捧着信，我想着以往的一切　　春　的永訣，父親的生平，幾年來我的創傷</p>
<p>十八的傍晚，家　　來　　父親就是十四的那日死了，永遠的離别了這人間！這言却要「待歸一面，然後封殮，」若果驟難賦旋，也必要「停柩堂左　，待歸出殯，」臨終的父親，是與春正永訣時互異子。</p>
<p>我不能歸，不能歸，就永遠的加劇了我的愴痛的心！十日以來，我哭，我笑，我失眠，我腦脹！朋友們說：「你瘦了不少！」「你要留意你自已的身體！大剌激終了時，往往就是病魔的光顧！」我祗知覺到咳嗽的傷風，竟延續了三星期還不見好，我走失了一切的主宰！</p>
<p>去臘母親的死，欲歸不得；然而我還能咽下我的涙，寫過五篇的紀念文字·今番喲，想寫一篇祭文，也是屢試屢輟，滿腦的情緒，怎樣也吐牽不止白紙。母親固屬是疼我愛我，但若比之父親，眞是天壤之差了。我忘懷不了我的母親，是她那麽爲人好，一樣的看待我的不爭氣的弟兄，一樣的看待親屬鄰居，她是一位廣泛的慈祥者。父親呢，他愛我彌篤，小時撫育，長時督勉，他六十年來的艱辛，希望，全頂在我的頭肩上。然而我多麽的慚愧呵！多麽的使他「死難瞑目」呵！</p>
<p>我的愴痛的心喲！</p>
<p>十一，廿六，午夜，涙筆。</p>
<h3>夜學風光</h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>在夜裏上課，和白天的學生，也許是不同的，好多的同學，不像白天，並不是富家的子弟，日裏都在工作，晚上還要念書，因此在這裏，一切的一切，没有貴族的色彩，自已賺錢，自已讀書，用不到家裏來供給你學費，是如何的可貴！</p>
<p>因爲在這裏讀書是自動的，所以上課的時候，也和平常的學校不同，敎員在講述，大家扯長了耳朶靜聽，怕是錯過了敎師的話，所以這裏决不會發生和敎員衝突，喝敎員倒彩這一類的大學風光，秩序是很鎭靜的。</p>
<p>但這裏也未始没有例外吧？也許他在講臺上，所講的是提不起聽衆的精神，一連兩小時課，眞使人煩悶，有時上了一小時便散課，求之不得，敎師還没有出門口，學生已跑完了，省得餓了肚皮，在課堂中很乏味的悶坐着。</p>
<p>某一天的夜裏，又是他下課了，本來在學生的希望中，上了一課就散的，那知他的精神這晚更是好，講得很高興，晶晶有味的講述，下課鐘響了之後，在學生以爲下課了，預先便走，可是敎師偏是還在講述，失望了，眞不起勁呢！</p>
<p>爲了他的連續講下去，精神太好了，結果在敎室中，發生了一種反常的狀態，有的在包書包，有的在拿衣服，因爲敎員低着頭在講，還没有看見這些舉動，可是再來一齣，鼕！鼕！鼕！皮鞋和地板相擊拍的聲音，一呼百應的充滿了這一間小小的敎室之中。</p>
<p>如果不是呆子，誰都會知道這是學生在摧促下課的表示，知趣的敎師，他聽見了當然也知道什麽一回事，結果便很不高興的退了課。頓足和着脚的聲音，已得獲了勝利，下了課走出了敎室，學生個個在笑談，似乎已可奏凱旋之歌而回家了。</p>
<p>其實這裏包書包的，拿衣服的，甚至在頓足的，祇不過是一小部分，大部分的人，是願意聽下去，結果便由少數的胡閙，使得多數人受了損失。他們，少數的他們，旣不願聽，固不必來聽，那又爲何要來呢？來了又爲何要胡閙？啊，爲的是點名簿上的ＸＸＸ到的符號，否則便不來上課了，同樣可混兩個學分。</p>

<p>特殊情形的學生，大都到這學校去肄業，所以學生不用招生廣告，亦就有許多，又因爲該校錄取新生辦法能迎合學生心理，大部份學生多樂往肄業。</p>
<p>校長Ｃ氏在校外還兼了某交易所職務，所以每天日間不是此地開會，便是他處開會，一到晚上，不是甲方應酬，便是乙方宴會，一天到晚忙得不亦樂乎，如有往訪他的人，須於三日前通知，預約時間地點，方能晤見，誠可謂能者多勞矣。</p>
<p>Ｓ校中有異性敎員Ｗ氏者，爲敎員中之佼校者，與Ｃ氏同事後，甚爲莫逆，進出同行，有識之者，常在遊戲場中遇見之，而Ｃ氏不知也，去冬Ｓ校又聘一位女敎員Ｌ姓者，担任鋼琴科目，Ｃ氏一見，無任欽佩，久而久之，常偕Ｌ氏同觀電影，或用汽車迎接宴會，如跳舞場，大飯店，常見彼倆人影踪，而Ｗ氏雖微有所聞，亦祗有忍耐而已，某星期日，Ｃ校長又電約Ｌ氏同觀電影，事爲Ｗ氏所知，及夜深回校，學生均已入睡，蓋已午夜一時矣，聞Ｗ氏臥室中爭執之聲，甚烈，直至三時始止，從此一場趣劇，傳播全校，自後即不聞再有爭執之事發生，蓋已作城下之盟矣聞盟約内容，Ｃ校長每月須津貼Ｗ氏若干番，每日須至Ｗ氏處一次，而Ｃ氏固使君有婦者，其夫人某氏，猶今居住校外附近某處，該校師生，遂有東宫西宫冷宫之呼號，蓋東宫係指Ｌ氏，西宫者係指Ｗ氏，而冷宫即指Ｃ夫人也，</p>
<h3>光榮</h3>

<p>幸運之神降臨了！光榮的啓幕：廣大的禮堂中走進這麽一羣演講委員會主席升了座，評判委員們就位，下面圍坐着演講員和聽衆，廣大的羣衆没有嘈雜，保守着一團嚴肅恬靜的空氣，不是往常上禮堂那麽「人嘶馬喊」「聲情鼎沸」了，這世界已被光榮的誘服：靜寂寂，喜洋洋。</p>
<p>不是胡混的。幸運總有個幸運，天才雖不可埋没，究竟天才總該加上幸運，才是光榮的正面。</p>
<p>是一個戰塲，諸葛亮舌戰羣雄没有這樣緊張！「摇動三寸不爛之舌，計取華東八强之標」，努力呵！成敗在此一舉！没勇氣的退下去，有聲譽的保持已往聲譽，有天才的來個後來居上，企求光榮必須有膽量，害羞畏怯是不行的。</p>
<p>九十分鐘疾駛過去，九條好漢中挑選出三位尖子，評判員代表報告結果；台下掌聲如雷動，祝福三位光榮的天使底勝利，幸運之神就此羽化而歸仙了。</p>

<p>丨丨對啦，我也是這樣預測的。倒是居第三的那位講得好極了！意義，發音，國語，姿勢都好，應該他得第一。</p>
<p>丨丨不談吧，不談吧！就是得第二的那位，講得也太壞，證在台上如同做「雙」簧一樣，而且還喜用排句，「的」和「嗎」都對得很整齊，笑話，笑話……</p>

<h3>上海（七）</h3>
<p>— 張老三</p>
<p>（十三）生成的鄕下姑娘</p>
<p>我跟在表姊身後，她的同伴神秘地微笑着，表姊跨着輕鬆的脚步回過頭來，向她們二個手指往天空一伸，一邊也會意似的點頭，我暗忖這又是上海新興的什麽玩意兒。</p>
<p>外祖母時常說起，表姊和我母親是生成的鄕下姑娘。母親每次歸家，表姊總是跟來住上十天半月的。敏姊走失後，她更常住在我家裏。我星期日從縣小歸來，兩個子偷到河邊摸泥鰍，變成尼搿羅是常有的事；不過當時是否有我第二個敏姊在中間，我的記憶之中像春夢一樣的模糊；因爲我直覺敏姊没有表姊好玩。她像閨閣千金，即是到河邊來看我們摸魚拾蚌，也滿露出不屑的表示；所以敏姊對於我的影像，在火車上未重遇之前，已不復有她的存在了。</p>
<p>表姊自母親外祖母相繼去世後，也絶跡不到我家來，舅父永遠瞧不起種田的農夫的一貫政策。但在孩子時代的短短過從中，我們表姊弟之間，始終是青梅竹馬，兩小無猜，除了父親從廟會中買給她的金魚缸，被我打破了，兩個小孩子也敵意的不開口二天。想起了這一回事，我望着蛇一般腰肢的表姊，不禁眼皮羞澀起來，人生的變化誠是魔一般的奇妙。摸泥鰍的表姊，寫長長的信，勸我兄弟二人努力的表姊，竟是個我見了面也不認識的都市姑娘。我恨時間是吃人的妖魔，要是外祖母遲死幾年的話，生成的鄕下姑娘，不知又是什麽模樣？</p>
<p>在一轉瞬之間，綜雜的思潮盡是湧上心來，脚步自然的放慢了，表姊已走完了石砌的甬道，像跳舞姿勢一樣的轉進藝術化的洋房自動門</p>
<p>（十四）莫須有的敎訓</p>
<p>走上半樓梯，表姊輕輕地對我說：「你先生外房等着，我進去看爸爸：今天要是他不願意見客，就不要見他」。說着微笑，那兩個笑渦告訴我别受舅父莫須有的敎訓。</p>
<p>二分鐘後，她探出半個身子，盍上左面的眼睛，喊我進去。舅父横臥在烟舖的右側，白了頭髮，出乎我意料的瘦，像一隻乾螳螂。穿了極厚的皮袍，兩隻枯骨的手巍顫顫的燒烟，旁邊站着表姊，我不知現在是什麽節令。</p>
<p>我呌了舅舅，他微微點頭。他好像來不及說話，烟槍的嘴對上自已的；抽盡了一口烟，是那樣的不費力，很快的接近茶壺嘴，呷了一口，兩股青烟從鼻官中鑽出來。手又忙着燒烟，見我還站在榻前，用手指點點横榻的下首，命我坐的意思。表姊授了他一支燃着的雪茄，他含了烟低聲的說：「幾時到上海的」！</p>
<p>「昨天，舅舅，」</p>
<p>「昨天爲什麽不來」，他放下雪茄，手中的烟泡黏到烟斗上去。</p>
<p>「到上海太晚了，恐怕不便。」</p>
<p>我不敢說我不願意來。舅父像女人患了歇司底里病一樣，時常毫無關係的發怒，我婉轉的撤了謊。但是舅父的面上很不好看，像要吐出莫須有的敎調來似的。又是來不及說話，對上烟槍的嘴。再含着雪茄燒烟，已恢復了常態，手指也顫動了，淡淡的說了一陣鄕下的瑣碎。表姊站在他背後頻頻以目示意，似乎責我說錯了話，又像懊悔忘了什麽事似的擠緊兩條人工的柳眉。及見他爸爸談到别的事，纔對我扮了個鬼臉。</p>
<p>談話告了結束，我終於述明了來意。</p>
<p>「呵！不巧啊！今天我要講經。大概你上海要住一時，先把行李搬到這裏來罷」。烟膏又燒上烟斗。</p>
<p>完全失敗了，兩年來不知聽了多少像這類的話，聰明的人不願意告訴你「没有辦法」，他使人自已「没有辦法」。敏姊「前途」就是這樣的一回事。</p>

<h3>中國電影藝人訪問記（二二四）（續昨）</h3>
<p>— 沙基</p>
<p>（十）「都會的早晨」導演蔡楚生（中）</p>
<p>「可不是麽，一般的人都以爲是不良份子在幹，少不了對電影輕視起來。今後，電影本身，一天一天的向前進步，因着天然淘汰，落伍的始終會落伍下去。無論如何，電影藝術是跟隨着時代的浪潮而變化的，假使有健全的人材實行眞幹的話。尤其是知識份子，更應當特别帮助電影發展，因爲電影究竟不是文明戲。」</p>
<p>說到這哀，有一個人推門而入，說是攝影場全預備好了，等他拍戲去。只聽得他說：</p>
<p>「敎他們等一會兒罷，我這裏還有一點兒事。」</p>
<p>「哦，先生還要拍戲嗎？」我覺惶悚：「那末請便罷。等你拍好了戲，我們再談。」</p>
<p>「不，不要緊的，我再待一會兒去没有關係。」他再繼續着說：「有人說我很傲謾，歐喜擺架子，其實這我的天性使然，我不大願意和人家交往。同時我覺得，無味的應酬，也不是藝人應有的態度。我以爲一個眞正的藝人，他的態度應當是眞實的，誠懇的，處心的。忠誠的爲自已的藝術努力，虚心的接收另人的批評。不管某一批評是否正確，然而這種不正確的批評，也一定有他的社會根據。任何種批評産生，决不會没有他内在的原因。同樣，不好的態度對人也會使人發生惡感的。」</p>
<p>「那末先生對於目前的電影路線有什麽意見呢？」我說。</p>
<p>「這一點我不想發表什麽意見。……很顯然的，空前的經濟恐慌，已經影響着中國社會的不安，……從各方面觀察，似乎是無從破壞也無從建設。……在這時候，電影作者只有扮小花臉，來幾套所謂Ｈumour。總之，在各方面的包圍之中，寫劇本的必須面面周全，顧到政治環境，顧全資本，還要顧全輿論。</p>
<p>「不過我以爲觀衆的心理是隨着時代的潮流而變遷的，現在誰也在封建社會中過得厭倦了，而希望在電影中得着新的東西。過去的神怪片，都給他們厭棄了，這决不是某種理論單純而硬生生的指導他們如此，而是他們對於電影希望著和生活一樣眞實的要求。而我們的責任却是更努力的提高觀衆的眼光，使他們從電影中得着新鮮的東西。這便是影響觀衆的人生。假如中國有了好的電影人材，那未在不久的將來；不適合於時代的作品，將必然的受着淘汰。」</p>
<p>說到這裏，他似乎非常興奮的。此時我又問他道：</p>
<p>「現在關於你自已的作品，也請說一點什麽罷。」</p>
<p>「我已經說過，我在作品中扮鬼臉，翻觔斗，「漁光曲」中便是如此，但是我决不使他完全没有意義。老實說，雖然我不前進，但是我决不後退。至少我的作品總能在君衆中發生一些作用。我從耕田到商店，從商店到電影領域中來，這中間的人生經騐，無疑義的對於現社會因着自已的體念而有相當的認識。（未完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「禁苑春濃」</h3>
<p>— 李馥</p>
<p>ＨerHighnessCommands</p>
<p>看了烏發的「禁苑春濃」（一九三一年出品）回來，頓使我想起了曾經在一本電影雜誌上看到過的烏發公司經理克里企（ＬudwigKlitsch）的談話，他說：一電影的使命，並不是在解釋現代的一切嚴肅的問題，乃是在對於人類鼓吹一種樂天主義，同時，大部分的電影的自的，是要使被辛苦壓制着的大衆得到一些安慰。我們要在他們看電影的二三小時之内，使他們知道，生活裏面並不是没有美屬，歡喜與和平。除出這些目的之外，當然，電影應該反映現代的精神上的國難，我們要喚起德意志帝國的過去的光榮，和加强德意志國民的建設的熱情」。克里企不單是烏發公司的經理，同時還是財政部長胡根堡的秘書，所以他的主見，就很明白地代表了「非常時德國的電影政策。</p>
<p>事實擺在眼前，德國一兩年來的影片，已經完全反映了上述的「使命譬如「晨曦」（Ｍorgenrot）等軍事電影的使命是在喚起德意志帝國的過去的光榮，「龍翔鳳舞」，「霓裳仙子」乃至這一張「禁苑春濃的使命都是在對於勤勞的大衆鼓吹暫時的樂天之義。</p>
<p>這是一張完全空想的Ｎonscene影片，他將「非常時」喘息着的市民帶進幻想的禁宫，使他們看到美麗的公主，聽到甜蜜的情歌，和經歷着許許多多現實世界所不能經歷的輕鬆的事故。帮事，照例的是英雄與美人；情節依舊是由戀愛而團圓，本來，所謂Ｎonscene作品，並不需要嚴整的結構，所以這劇本抓住觀衆的地方，祇在那些和故事没有連繫的穿插，和偶爾的可以逗人發笑的語妙。</p>
<p>這影片照一般講，是具備着一切商業上的優越的條件的，可是他的缺點，是在劇本的本身。豐琳哈蕙和享利伽萊，這兩個有爲的演員，在這兒並没有多的成就，尤其是哈蕙，她的成績可說是遠在「龍翔鳳舞」之下。導演ＨansSchwarz，攝影ＧutarRittau，也可以算是烏發第一流的搭檔，但是，在這片子的成績，也没有特别值得介紹的地方。</p>
<p>這是一張給你休息，給作娱樂的影片，假使你在工作疲勞之後，不願意去想嚴肅的問題，而祇想暫時的去陶醉一下，那麽，你不妨去游一游這值得迷戀的禁宫，當然，假使你能懂得對白，懂得複印的字幕，那麽你一定可以暫時的忘記了淨生的苦悶的。</p>
<h3>評「夜半槍聲」</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>丨北京映丨</p>
<p>自一九三○年以來，中國電影開始有了新的傾向，聯華公司應當在我們的記憶中佔着重要地位。及至一三個摩登女性」開映之後，我們對於聯華的期望愈益加深。這在聯華出品能夠吸引廣大的觀衆，可以得着明　的例證。因此，聯華的製片者，其對於出品之愼重，而不負艱衆之期望之照理磨當是必然的態度。然而事實上並不如此，雖則我們並不說出它自出品中有着開倒車的傾向，可是有些影片，的礎使人失望。特别是廣東事四廠的作品，更使人失望。不久以前開映的「古寺鵑聲，一受着了觀衆的指斥，這自然是因着天堂地　的果報主義的不過，可是現在又有了這封建的個人主義的「夜半槍聲。」</p>
<p>現在我只想在故事來說。</p>
<p>就一般的偵探影片來說，故事的結構應當很緊凑，而且要多幾個曲折，多佈幾個疑陣。這是我們在美國出品中常常可以得着例證的。當然我們並不必擁護偵探片之在在，不過是藉以緊張人們的感情而吸引觀衆，所以就事論事，上述諸點，一定要儘可能的做到。</p>
<p>但是，「夜半槍聲對於題外的發展，却盡量延長，而忽略了偵探片的主要點。譬如劇作者將錢淑婣和周懷遠的戀愛關係，寫得十分冗長，自海外歸來直至愛情的破裂，其中十分認眞，然而這些都和劇的中心没有直接關係，而使人因此懷疑這是純粹的戀愛影片。直至槍聲嚮後，而轉人本題，然而事先我們却可斷定那一個錢務能决非正兇，因爲他拿的那把刀已經說得太明顯了。但是這都不是主要的缺點，我們所要說的却是說爲什麽周懷遠不和錢淑婣結婚，照劇的發展來說，他們是應當結合的，難道殺父之仇，眞能使他們破裂嗎？這種封建的觀念之我們認爲没有必要的。他如没有理由的將錢務能寫成流氓，這和錢如明的奸詐是没有正反配合的。至於姨太太的私通勾當，應當先有一些介紹，僅僅是槍聲之前一個姨太太袒胸露肉的鏡頭的是不夠的，因爲她情人的出現，到底使人突然。雖則常看偵探片的人們，未嘗不决定那姨太太是正兇，就此可知，劇作者對於疑陣的佈置，仍是不夠。</p>
<p>然而另一方面，攝影等個别的技巧，却都在水平線以上。演員們雖不討好，却很認眞，特别是女主角黃曼梨和何大　，都有獨到之處。同樣，我們在這些地力都相當的看出導演還有成績，如外景的取材等等，不過使人覺得太不經濟罷了。</p>
<p>關於小地方，我們可指出，最後錢淑嫻的汽車之時間上的特寫，李孟求在牢裡捉臭虫等等。可是李孟求的僕人梳頭時的塲面，却是胡閙無聊之至。</p>
<h3>「牧國英雄」</h3>
<p>— 評摩爾</p>
<p>“ＨiddenGold”丨新光丨</p>
<p>國片香草美人」，據說因爲是一反帝影片，而爲公部局停止公映，接着的就是這張一牧國英雄一！</p>
<p>湯密十和他的坐騎「湯尼」，在美國電影界開關了一條路，博得了相當的觀衆，替黃金的美國，　了很多錢：但是終於因爲故事的無味與公式，連美國的下層羣衆以及小孩子都表示厭倦一！而只能在中國的戲院中塡補着因爲反帝而取締的中國片子。</p>
<p>「牧國英雄」，是一張典型的「西部片」，他不但是一張武俠片，同時更是一張牧場片。</p>
<p>關於他的故事我想不用說，因爲反正只是「義俠殺人」罷了，在這種故事中，我們當然找不出一點推動世界的思想和力量。有的，只是可憐的小市民的幻想罷了。</p>
<p>導演武俠片，本來和普通影片有點不同，不同的地方，就是儘量的留下膠片，讓演員表現他的武術，因爲武俠片的主要的地方就是這些。</p>
<p>但是這裏所請讓演員表現他的武術聰明的導演，是不會機械的讓武俠片的演員，像騎師或則玩把戲的人那樣，眞的拚命做。他應該用盡各種各樣的方法，把空氣弄得緊張，使觀衆不必看到主角的跑馬開槍，已經感到緊張，然後主角出現時，只要稍爲努力一點，觀衆就感到滿足了。</p>
<p>并且，英雄兒女，並不是武俠片的唯一道路。在武俠片中我們應該跳出這個範圍，因爲這實在太陳舊了，觀衆實在太厭倦了。「牧國英雄」是完全没有做到我下面所說幾點的。</p>
<p>「湯密士」的武術，的確十分高明。不過他的面部表情，是一點也没有的。自然，因爲武俠片的注意大動作，面部表情之類，不免放鬆。但是在緊張的時候，用一個面部恃寫，和購戀愛的「眉言目語」一定是有助於影片的效果的。他的馬是非常好的。</p>
<p>最後，我們更應指出美國電影界的犧牲精神。他們因爲要眞實不惜把張值餞的東西毁了，在資本薄弱的中國電影界，當然做到的。</p>
<h3>電影小說吉地（一）天一聲片邵醉翁導演</h3>
<p>— 曹雪松</p>
<p>是火熱的夏。啊！偉大的夏，不單使田野一齊穿上綠的錦裳，而且使陌上的荳兒熟了，瓜田裡的瓜也正好採摘了。</p>
<p>在這炎炎如火的長夏裡，雖則有錢的公子小姐們，整天的飲着氷，嚼着瓜，口裡還要不住的喊熱；但我們生長在鄕村裡的阿良，和他同村的女孩子香姑，爲了生活，不管天氣是如何的炎熱，却胼手胝足的在田野裡工作着。阿良在鋤着地，香姑在採着瓜，他們一面努力地工作，一面歡快地談笑。雖然他們流着不少的汗，但他們並不感到怎樣的疲勞</p>
<p>香姑將瓜兒採滿了兩籃，阿良怕她女孩子家挑不動這得擔，便自告奮勇的代替她挑了起來，送她回去。不料挑走幾步，因爲瓜兒裝得太滿了，竟從籃裡跌下一個到地上來。「啊！瓜兒跌破了！」阿良看着跌破的瓜兒這樣對香姑說。「不要緊。我們吃了它吧。」香姑這樣温柔地說。</p>
<p>於是，他倆在綠柳蔭裡停了下來，並肩坐在綠羢般的草地上，將這個瓜兒分開來大家細嚼着，好鳥在枝頭囀着銀嗓在歌唱，流波在他倆身旁的小溪裡合着拍子般舒徐的流着，周遭是如畫的風景，眼前是如花的愛伴，口裡是如密的甜瓜，啊，甜到他倆的心頭，他倆是禁不住陶醉在這美景中了。</p>
<p>他倆吃罷了瓜，復閑談了一回，阿良依舊擔起瓜來送她回去，到了家裡，香姑很天眞地跑到她母親面前說着：「媽媽，這許多瓜全靠他替我挑回來的。」香姑說這話，是想替阿良討奸的意思。</p>
<p>「這幾個瓜，自已都挑不動，幹麽要人家挑？」阿良眞料不到香姑的母親會說出這樣的話，於是，他只好悵悵地走開走了，香姑滿臉的不高興，只好默默地低下頭去！</p>
<p>幾天以後，大地主許鴻業，帶了兩個家人，自已騎了一匹駿馬，到山明水秀的菱花村來尋覓墓地，因爲他的老父已臥病多時，近幾天來痢得更重了，他料想到他老人家已没有多大希望，所以不等他死時，便預先下鄕來爲他尋找長眠的吉地了。（未完）</p>

<h3>Chiang Faction Airplanes Scatter Leaflets in Fujian, Urging the 19th Route Army Soldiers to Mutiny and Return Within a Week, Navy Begins Inspecting Import and Export Vessels</h3>
<p>(Nanchang) Chairman Chiang dispatched airplanes to Fujian to scatter a proclamation to the officers and soldiers of the 19th Route Army, stating: "Now, the Kuomintang and the National Government of China are determined to bomb and pacify the traitorous, country-selling, enemy-surrendering, and bandit-colluding pseudo-government in Fuzhou within the next few days. However, we cannot bear to immediately bomb the locations of our 19th Route Army soldiers, lest they be injured or killed together. We hope that you will immediately revolt, denounce the rebellion, and not fall into the Communist bandits' poisonous schemes, leading to self-destruction. Therefore, we will wait for a week, unwilling to treat you as collaborators. We hope that our soldiers will deeply understand the righteousness and, within this week, eliminate the pseudo-government in Fuzhou and break away to return. Otherwise, everything will be destroyed together, which would be extremely regrettable." (Central News Agency dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) The Headquarters publicly released a statement by a certain important person, saying: "There are indeed proposals to bomb the Fujian rebels. The Central Air Force is also sufficient to crush the Fujian rebels. However, except for Chen and Li, the rest are innocent, so bombing will be temporarily postponed, hoping that they will break away on their own. The land and air forces will continue to concentrate on suppressing the communists, and the original plan will not be changed due to the Fujian rebellion." (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the handling of the Fujian rebellion, the Naval Department plans to extend the deadline by one week, giving the 19th Route Army an opportunity to consider.

Only the garrison personnel remain in Nanjing. The central government's military preparations for the Fujian rebellion have been completed. To support the military supplies for each division and facilitate transportation, it is planned to establish a General Directorate of Military Stations.

One day before blockading the coastline, a diplomatic note should be issued to friendly nations, requesting that, in accordance with international law, they cut off maritime supplies to the rebels and suspend the entry and exit of any warships or merchant ships to avoid misunderstandings. At the same time, it should be declared that if the above-mentioned events occur, the Chinese government will resolutely handle them and not be responsible for any losses.

The destinations are Guangdong, Guangxi, Shanghai, Beiping, and Jinan. The selection of representatives is being consulted. A certain elder statesman said that the significant meaning of convening this plenary session is to deal with the destruction of the party and the abandonment of flags in Fujian.

<h3>Chiang Telegram Reports to Beiping on the Smooth Progress of Communist Suppression</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding the Jiangxi communist suppression military situation, since the Fujian rebellion, a certain authority in North China telegraphed Jiangxi to inquire about the truth and received a reply from Chiang on the 27th, stating: "Since last month, there has been a battle at Xiaoshi Zixi Town, a second battle at Huwan, a third battle at Jiantian, a fourth battle at Daxiongguan, and a fifth battle at Shengang Dangkou. Every battle has been won. The 1st, 3rd, 5th, and 7th pseudo-army corps have all been engaged in successive battles and have been severely damaged. Casualties are piling up. The captures in the three battles of Huwan, Daxiongguan, and Shengang Dangkou were especially numerous. They have been fleeing to Guangchang and Ningdu. According to Le Linzhang, deputy commander of the pseudo-6th Division, who was captured, since our army's five encirclements and suppressions, the 1st, 3rd, 5th, and 7th pseudo-army corps have suffered more than one-third casualties from injuries, illnesses, and deaths. On the 3rd of this month, Zhu De convened a meeting in Jianning, saying that the national army is building blockhouses and gradually approaching, which is difficult to deal with. There is no better strategy than to have each pseudo-army corps harass our rear separately. This can be seen from this. Our army has built blockhouses from Ji'an, Jishui, Yongfeng, and Le'an to Lizhou and Jinxi, forming a horizontal line to the north. They are still being built, densely scattered and mutually supportive, making it easy to advance, retreat, and defend. On the 26th, our army also occupied Huangshid渡, an important place in Jinxi and Guangze, and defeated the bandits." (Special dispatch on the 29th)</p>

<h3>The Suffering of Northeastern Compatriots Under the Oppression of Violent Japan, Talk by Mao Daxun, an Employee of the Chinese Eastern Railway</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Japan uses violence to seize our Northeast and uses puppets to destroy and oppress our nation by all means. Mao Daxun, a Chinese Eastern Railway employee who was recently forced to leave his job and come to Nanjing, described in detail the situation after the Northeast fell into enemy hands and the recent conflict of interest between Japan and Russia. A brief record is as follows: After the September 18th Incident occurred and Liaoning and Jilin fell, the young people full of enthusiasm in northern Manchuria secretly contacted each other to resist. Violent Japan deployed plainclothes detectives everywhere to strictly arrest them. After being arrested, they were tied upside down by their feet, chili oil was poured into their noses, or pig bristles were inserted into their urethral orifices. They were sent to remote places outside the city late at night and killed by cruel means. For example, outside Harbin City, 250 people were assassinated at one time. Later, more than 50 road police officers on the Hu Hai Railway were buried alive. Their cruelty and brutality are worse than poisonous snakes and fierce beasts. This was a past atrocity. The current poison schemes are even more severe. The administrative, diplomatic, financial, military, political, and educational affairs of the pseudo-state are all in the hands of the Japanese. The so-called Puyi regent is just a signing puppet. The nation is encouraged to gamble, public opium is sold, and heroin, morphine, and other poisons are added to the cigarettes. Addiction occurs after only a slight puff. If this continues for only ten years, I am afraid that the people of the Northeast will all be drawn into the dark. Cultural aggression is used in education. The textbooks prescribed by the pseudo-state's Ministry of Education remove all patriotic materials and anything related to our country's culture and force all schools to add Manchu lessons. I am afraid that in less than ten years, the people of the Northeast will not know that there is China. As for its attitude towards Russia, due to historical grievances and the direct interests of northern Manchuria, the situation has become like fire and water. Recently, they have deliberately provoked Russia, first seizing the eight station docks of the Chinese Eastern Railway and then blocking the transportation on the east and west lines of the Chinese Eastern Railway. Once the exports on the east and west lines are blocked, the Russian Siberian and Ussuri railways will be greatly hit, and the Vladivostok port will become a dead port. Because Soviet Russia wants to sell goods and obtain raw materials in the East Asian market, it cannot transport them without the Chinese Eastern Railway. Therefore, the Chinese Eastern Railway is very important to them. They would rather suffer great sacrifices than give it up. The rumor that the road is being sold is just a diplomatic tactic to implement a delaying strategy, so there have been no results after months of meetings in Tokyo. Violent Japan's plans have not succeeded, so they are bribing Chinese employees as a basis for seizing road rights, instructing the "pseudo-state" to organize the "Cooperation Society" and forcing all Chinese employees to join. Once they join the society, they must change their affiliation to the pseudo-state and completely sever relations with their motherland. All those with backbone oppose joining. I and others have been forced to leave our jobs because we opposed joining this disguised traitorous society, which aroused the hostility of violent Japan. Now we are selling our clothes to come to Nanjing and petition the authorities, hoping that the press will give us more assistance. I especially hope that the central government will take advantage of the conflict between Japan and Russia and make full preparations to recover the lost land. Do not stand idly by and watch, so that our beautiful land will be occupied by foreign races forever. (Special dispatch on the 29th)</p>

<h3>Commentary: The Plunge in Yarn Prices and the Benevolence of the Cotton Industry Control Association</h3>
<p>Yesterday, cotton yarn prices suddenly plummeted, with a sharp drop of more than six yuan in a single day. This was the most significant decline seen in recent months. According to newspaper reports, there are two reasons for the drop in market prices. One is the fear arising from the Minbian (Fujian Incident), the prospect of sales in the South being hopeless. The other is the Cotton Industry Control Association's recent release of 5,000 bales of cotton yarn that it had previously acquired.</p>
<p>That the price of Chinese cotton yarn will inevitably trend downwards has always been seen as a certainty by pessimists. However, if yesterday's drop in cotton yarn prices was indeed caused by the Cotton Industry Control Association, which has taken on the responsibility of raising yarn prices, then we cannot remain silent.</p>
<p>We recall that when the Control Association decided to raise yarn prices, it attributed the cause to the excessive stock of yarn in the exchange. This led to the organization of the He Xing Company, which began to purchase large quantities of stored yarn. Even in the three days of the previous week, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, the Cotton Control Association sent people out to acquire more than 20,000 bales to stabilize market prices. The goal was, of course, to raise yarn prices today. Furthermore, those in charge of the Cotton Control Association had previously declared to the outside world that all the yarn collected by the association would be transported to other ports and would never be released in this port again. The tone was sincere. We thought there might be a chance that yarn prices would stabilize temporarily. Who would have expected that in just a few days, the facts would be as they are now? In that case, will those who absolutely trusted the Cotton Control Association in the past not start to doubt it now? A month ago, there were rumors of speculation by the Cotton Control Association in the market. Now, these rumors are likely to intensify.</p>
<p>From our perspective as observers, we believe that the increasingly worse situation of cotton yarn prices today cannot be attributed to a single cause. The accumulation of yarn in the exchange is only a proximate cause. The real reason for the price drop should be sought in the reasons why the stock of yarn in the exchange is accumulating. According to our limited understanding, after September 18th (Mukden Incident), the movement to boycott Japanese goods was more intense in Central and South China. As a result, Japanese mills lowered their prices and monopolized sales in the North China market. Recently, traces of Japanese yarn have also been found everywhere in the Central and South China markets. Moreover, in addition to Japanese yarn, other foreign yarns have also infiltrated. The influx of foreign yarn into the market has relatively reduced the purchasing power of the Chinese people for Chinese yarn. In fact, today there are only about 2.6 million Chinese mill spindles nationwide. On average, there is only one spindle for every 150 people. If there were no foreign yarn in our market today, Chinese yarn would be in short supply, and there would be no reason for market prices to fall. The reason for the fall is actually due to the competition from foreign yarn. As a result of this competition, Chinese yarn is in a very unfavorable position.</p>
<p>So, why can't Chinese yarn compete with foreign yarn? The most obvious reason is the constraints of unequal treaties and the strong capital of foreign mills. Other reasons, such as the unbalanced burden of taxes, are also a major factor. Take the stamp tax as an example: Chinese mills must pay it, but foreign mills can be exempt. Other examples include cotton yarn consolidated tax, which distinguishes based on 23 counts, which is tantamount to favoring foreign mills that mainly spin fine yarn and discriminating against Chinese mills that mainly spin coarse yarn. In addition, foreign mills can avoid various harsh local taxes. As a result, the positions of foreign yarn and Chinese yarn are clearly different, and the inability of Chinese yarn to compete with foreign yarn has become inevitable. It is no wonder that the Chinese market is being controlled by foreign yarn, and the path for Chinese yarn sales is becoming increasingly narrow.</p>
<p>Therefore, if we want to talk about raising yarn prices today, we should think about the root causes of the problem. The daily accumulation of yarn in the exchange is due to the narrowing of sales channels for Chinese yarn. If ways can be found to expand sales channels, in other words, if the obstacles to Chinese yarn can be eliminated, then yarn prices will rise naturally without artificial intervention. Yesterday's sharp drop in yarn prices was partly due to the impact of the Cotton Control Association's release of yarn. But on the other hand, it also urges the Cotton Control Association to make future efforts. If the Cotton Control Association can think about the root causes in the future and not focus solely on buying and selling yarn, then yarn prices can easily be raised, and the doubts about the Cotton Control Association will be dispelled.</p>
<h3>The Current Situation at the Mouth of the Yellow River; The River Course Changes Rapidly</h3>
<p>(Jinan) The commissioner of the Yellow River Affairs Bureau, who measured the mouth of the Yellow River, has returned to Jinan. According to him, within 90 li of the river mouth, there is a vast expanse of reeds and many pirates. The river course changes very rapidly. This summer, it was still divided into multiple channels entering the sea, but now it is gradually shifting southward, leaving only one channel with slow and weak flow. It is only passable for boats in shallow areas, with sandy bottoms in the middle and silt on both sides. Han (Jin) is urging personnel to speed up disaster relief. (29th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Sugimura Suggests to Hirota a Policy of Differentiation Towards China; Hirota Opens a Public-Private Dialogue on China; Cultural Work to Open Sino-Japanese Relations</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The public-private dialogue on China policy initiated by Foreign Minister Hirota was held at the Foreign Minister's residence this afternoon. Foreign Minister Hirota and other leading figures from the Foreign Ministry, as well as scholars such as Dr. Tatsukichi Minobe, Dr. Unokichi Hattori, and Dr. Kanji Sato, and figures from the business community such as Mansunosuke Otagiri, Sadajo Eguchi, and Umekichi Yoneyama, attended. Foreign Minister Hirota stated that cultural work was necessary to open relations with China. After exchanging opinions, the meeting adjourned at 3 pm in the afternoon. (29th Den-tsu Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) At 11 am today, Yotaro Sugimura visited Foreign Minister Hirota at the Foreign Ministry to report on his inspection of Manchuria and Mongolia and made the following suggestions regarding future China policy: (1) The decline of the Chinese central government has created opportunities for the expansion of local regimes. China policy should shift from a single-faceted approach to a multi-faceted one. (2) The Chinese people have recognized the ineffectiveness (?) of the anti-Japanese policy regarding the Manchurian problem. (3) Rapidly establish contingency measures for the extraordinary situation in 1935 to avoid being trapped by China at that time. (4) To ensure Sino-Japanese cooperation, influential figures should visit China to exchange views with the Chinese side. Foreign Minister Hirota also agreed with Sugimura's proposals. Sugimura left at noon. (29th Den-tsu Dispatch)</p>
<h3>A Thorny Issue for Various Countries</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Yotaro Sugimura, who inspected various parts of China, returned to Tokyo on the 28th. Sugimura told reporters that the contents of the Chinese problem were roughly as follows: (1) China's external relations: During my trip to China, I directly met with Chinese politicians and Europeans and Americans residing in China. According to what I saw and heard, China's external observations have gradually changed from the past. That is, the Chinese have changed their attitude of relying solely on Europe and the United States to carry out matters and now have more faith in their own ideas. This is quite evident. In the past, during the Paris Peace Conference and the Washington Conference, China used the power of foreign countries, and foreign countries helped China. As a result, the power relations of foreign countries in the Far East were unusually complex. However, this situation has now been swept away, and foreign officials stationed in China feel that China is a thorny issue.</p>
<h3>Soong Tzu-wen is Powerless</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of cooperation between the League of Nations and China, Japan emphasizes the content, but the Chinese government does not consider it a major issue. Its commissioner, Lehman, is only entangled with Soong Tzu-wen. What power does Soong Tzu-wen have to do anything today? (2) China's view of Japan: Currently, China has many misunderstandings about Japan's economic difficulties, the conflict between parliamentary politics and fascism, and Japan's so-called national crisis. China observes these things with Chinese-style exaggeration. I rely on listing various facts to illustrate the errors in these observations. In this state, only those who have studied in Japan have a proper view of Japan. Their understanding of Japan is accurate and cannot be compared to the ignorance of those who have studied in Europe and the United States.</p>
<h3>Key Points of Japanese Policy</h3>
<p>(3) Key points of Japan's policy towards China: Where should Japan place its emphasis when observing China? It is essential to view China through the lens of bustling metropolitan areas such as Shanghai. In the interior, internal strife continues to erupt, and wealthy people from all over the country are bringing their family property and concentrating in Shanghai. As a result, 10 million yuan in cash has flowed into Shanghai, leading to an abnormal inflationary phenomenon. However, the poverty and exhaustion of farmers and laborers has reached its extreme. Japanese politicians should observe the overall situation in China and decide on practical policies. (29th Japan United Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Utilizing Pro-Japanese Factions</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Minister Yotaro Sugimura, who inspected various parts of China and "Manchukuo" for about 80 days, returned to Tokyo at 9 pm yesterday. He made the following remarks to reporters: The biggest problem in China today is the Communist bandit problem. In Shanghai, I said that with Chiang Kai-shek's strength, it would not be difficult to wipe out the Jiangxi Communists within three months. But in Hankou, they said that even if it took three years, it would be difficult to eliminate them. Chinese intellectuals acknowledge that, from the perspective of the current international situation, forcing the advance of foreign countries and oppressing Japan will ultimately only cause suffering to China. However, the so-called pro-Japanese factions of today, who advocate the return of Manchuria based on European-style legal theories, are very weak. We should do our utmost to assist these pro-Japanese people. What is noteworthy is that the Zhejiang financial groups are very concerned about "Manchukuo" recently. Song Ziwen's resignation this time is one aspect of this. China is currently undergoing a process of decomposition. Japan must devise countermeasures for all parties. As for the general feelings in China, they all say that Japan will inevitably succumb between 1936 and 1940. This is due to a lack of understanding of Japan on the Chinese side. To correct this lack of understanding, Japanese businessmen and civilians must go to China one after another to have frank discussions with Chinese intellectuals and proceed with sincere Sino-Japanese friendship, focusing on this point.

<h3>Hirota's Ambition: Using Differentiation Tactics Towards the Powers; Will First Promote Negotiations with Britain and the United States</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota has been giving detailed consideration to the Second Washington Conference and the empire's diplomatic work in handling the international emergency situation centered on it since taking office. It is reported that since the Versailles Peace Conference, major conferences of open meetings that have been held repeatedly, such as the disarmament conference and the international economic conference, have mostly failed. Relatively speaking, only conferences between two or three countries have been successful. Based on this experience, the conclusion has been reached that only by devoting all efforts to preliminary meetings between two or three countries can success be achieved. Once support is obtained from the relevant parties, Japan will take the lead in promoting the start of positive negotiations with countries such as Britain and the United States to seek the success of the conference. At the same time, to make the disarmament conference a truly peaceful conference, it is planned to advocate the abolition of offensive weapons that destroy human civilization to break the international deadlock and ensure world peace. Preparations are currently underway. (29th Den-tsu Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Since taking office, Foreign Minister Hirota has been vigorously promoting friendship between Japan and the United States. Recently, he also decided to propose preliminary negotiations between Japan and the United States next year, after the new ambassador to the United States takes office, to discuss the central topic of the Second Washington Conference. Foreign Minister Hirota believes that international conferences such as the League of Nations and the London Economic Conference have all failed. He believes that conducting preliminary negotiations between the two countries in advance to discuss important issues and gain understanding is an effective way to ensure the success of international conferences. With this view, he plans to hold preliminary negotiations between Japan and the United States before the disarmament conference opens to express Japan's claims and solicit opinions from the other side to find a compromise method. This matter will be discussed with Naval Minister Osumi to determine specific methods after the budget problem is resolved. (29th Japan United Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ambassador Debuchi to the United States is scheduled to arrive in Beijing on December 14th or 15th to report on the situation in the United States to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Foreign Minister Hirota has resolved to transfer the Ambassador to the United States. Foreign Minister Hirota convened a meeting of Japanese and American dignitaries in Tokyo. After two or three meetings, the policy towards the United States has been slightly clarified. After the budget problem is resolved, he will consult with Naval Minister Osumi on disarmament strategies for the Second Washington Conference and the London Conference. It is also planned to propose preliminary meetings to the United States, which must be contacted by the United States and Japan first, because the opposition between the two countries is even more intense. If the problems between the two countries are resolved, the problems between other countries will not be difficult to solve. Standing from this position, the United States and Japan plan to propose to the United States from next spring. The new Ambassador to the United States will also serve as a representative to the preliminary meeting. Therefore, it is desirable to appoint a top-notch Japanese politician to this position. The reasons why the Japanese government wants to hold preliminary meetings early are as follows: (1) Japan must concentrate its efforts on building Manchuria and turning this place into a Japanese colony. If the international situation is unstable during this construction period, the Chinese in the East Three Provinces will never be willing to submit to the Japanese, the domestic security cannot be maintained, and huge construction costs will be required, making it inconvenient to start wars. (2) Japan still has an advantage in naval power in 1936, so it must take this opportunity to wage war against the United States. If the meeting is held in 1936 and the meeting fails, Japan will have missed its good opportunity to declare war. (29th China United Dispatch)</p>
<h3>More Than 20,000 Japanese Communists Arrested; Many Prosecutors and Teachers are Red</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Since the massive crackdown on the Japanese Communist Party, it is now close to being completely purged. The following is a record of the achievements in eliminating the Communists announced by the Tokyo Local Prosecutor's Office over the years: In fiscal year 1928, 1,850 people were arrested, and 200 people were prosecuted. In fiscal year 1929, 3,567 people were arrested, and 202 people were prosecuted. In fiscal year 1930, 3,737 people were arrested, and 144 people were prosecuted. In fiscal year 1931, 6,903 people were arrested, and 54 people were prosecuted. In fiscal year 1932, 9,215 people were arrested, and 242 people were prosecuted. From October 20 to the present in fiscal year 1933, 4,377 people were arrested, and 405 people were prosecuted. In total, 29,646 people were arrested, and 1,247 people were prosecuted. It was found that during the first four years, all efforts were made to arrest communists, but the number continued to increase afterward. It was feared that there were those who were providing resources, so since the spring of last year, the goal was to destroy their financial power, which has been very effective. The Communist Party, which was exhausted in terms of action funds, provoked the Omori Incident in September of last year to obtain funds. On the one hand, they used the Manchurian Incident as an opportunity, and people successively changed their policies. In June of this year, the leaders Sano and Nabeyama surrendered and confessed, which allowed the prosecutor's office to gain more momentum. They then moved towards external organizations and arrested upper-class people such as red prosecutors in the courts and red lawyers' groups. They have completely achieved their desired goals, so they have these excellent results. (29th Japan United Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to the Japanese Ministry of Justice, after the red prosecutors Nagasaki and Sakamoto were arrested, a certain Nishikan, who was implicated in the case, confessed the inside story of the organization he participated in to the judge. The judge then learned that there were still many prosecutors who had not been brought to justice. On February 27, the case was reopened. The judge of the Nagasaki Court was Takenari Nosuke (transliteration), the judge of the Motohoro Court was Kakiuchi Reisaku, and the judge of the Tsuruoka branch of the Yamagata Court, Fukuda Osuke, and the clerks Tsunoi and Hayai were arrested. Judge Takenari had been a member of the Social Science Research Association since his student days. When he arrived in Nagasaki, he organized a cultural cell with clerks Yamamoto and Kitamura and Hideo Tajima to carry out propaganda work for the Communist Party. Judge Kakiuchi went to the Yamagata Court and incited Judge Fukuda and Clerk Hirai to participate in the Red Relief Association. Under the command of Kojima Shibata from the party headquarters, they organized intellectual groups. Judge Fukuda and others contributed all the funds to the members, donating a considerable amount of money. All five were prosecuted for violating the Public Order Maintenance Law. According to a survey by the Ministry of Justice, since March 15, Showa 3, or 1928, when the Tanaka Cabinet began to crack down on the Communist Party, 29,646 people have been arrested and 1,247 people have been prosecuted as of October 20 this year, for a period of six years.

<h3>Japan's Active Economic Aggression: Europe is Threatened and Uneasy; British Business Circles Strongly Condemn the Government for Expediting Response; Mussolini and Litvinov Will Also Discuss</h3>
<p>(London) Lord William, chairman of the National Confederation of Industries, declared solemnly at the National Confederation of Industries in London today when discussing Japanese competition: "We must either agree or declare war." Lord William advocated that the state should formulate a trade policy to resolve the plan to deal with Japanese competition, and requested that the government immediately resolve this issue with the assistance of merchants and from a commercial starting point. He said, "We should know what conditions we should demand or accept. The Japanese have already thought about this matter carefully." (28th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Several members of the House of Commons today expressed their indignation that the British government has taken no action against the competition from Japanese rayon and flannel products. Commerce Minister Runciman stated that the government is well aware that not only the textile industry is affected by Japanese competition, and is giving extremely careful consideration to this entire issue. But first, we must see the results of the current discussions between British and Japanese industrialists on cotton and rayon goods. The government is always taking action, so the House of Commons need not panic. If woolen goods industrialists follow the example of cotton goods textile manufacturers in having the same negotiations, the government will naturally provide all kinds of assistance.

<p>Italian newspapers in Rome have widely publicized the issue of Japanese dumping endangering Europe. The Times, the Morning Post, and the Tribune all commented on this matter with lengthy articles today. The Times said, "The world market never expected the arrival of Japanese goods. Japan is now openly attacking." The newspaper then made a comparison of the selling prices of Japanese goods and the selling prices of goods from several European countries, and said that Brazil has now ordered warships from Japan. The newspaper continued, "The Tokyo government denies that it intends to implement a dumping policy. When Japan sees that countries have expressed opposition, it sends representatives to lobby them to believe that Japan has no intention of dumping." The Tribune said, "Under the current industrial conditions, the old principles of free trade are no longer appropriate. Western countries now only have one economic defense policy, which is the restriction of import quantities. Britain is now also mentioning maritime protection policies and import quantity restriction measures as practical needs. The new diplomatic policy of mixed political technology adopted by various countries recently should use this move as the basis for measurement. As for whether the restriction of import quantities itself is good or bad, it is not necessary to ask." We still remember that when Prime Minister Mussolini spoke to the National Council of Vocational Groups on November 14 of this year, he already mentioned the danger of Japanese competition. Foreign Minister Litvinov of the Soviet Union will come with intent in a few days, and will meet with Mussolini to discuss issues between them. This is one of them. The current propaganda in Italian newspapers is to guide public opinion in preparation for this issue. (28th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Takahashi Softens on Naval Demands; Revived Requests Reach 75 Million</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The total amount of the revived budget determined by the Ministry of Finance's Provincial Council today is approximately 75 million yuan, of which 40 million is for the Navy, 25 million for the Army, approximately 10 million for agriculture and forestry, and the rest for other emergency (sic) The cabinet meeting will review the matter and include it in the supplementary budget. (29th Den-tsu Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The various ministries, with the Navy Ministry at the forefront, made fierce revival requests. Finance Minister Takahashi, in order to prevent the beginnings of financial collapse, considered the limits of bond issuance and strongly opposed it. However, as a result of a meeting with Naval Minister Osumi on the 18th, his attitude softened somewhat. He knew that revival requests had to be recognized to some extent in order to get things done. As a result, the total amount recognized was approximately 60 million yuan, more than half of which was occupied by the Navy. As a result, the total budget can be limited to 2.1 billion yuan.

<h3>Mussolini Advocates a New International Conference; Using the Four-Power Pact to Resolve Disarmament; Inviting the United States and Japan to Discuss Reforming the League of Nations; All Parties Are Eagerly Awaiting Berlin's Final Proposal</h3>
<p>Roman Interior Minister Mussolini is currently planning to convene multiple meetings with the British, French, and German ambassadors and Russian Foreign Commissioner Litvinov, hoping to create a five-power group to first seek preliminary agreement on disarmament policies, and then greatly reorganize the League of Nations, and hopes that the United States and Japan will also join the group to form a large group sufficient to control world peace. Today, Mussolini invited the new British Ambassador and former League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond for an hour-long talk, and it is also said that he will have similar talks with other country's ambassadors before Litvinov arrives. It is heard that the talks between the Italian Interior Minister and the British Ambassador focused on disarmament, so that Germany can immediately return to the League of Nations. The discussions cover about five points:</p>
<p>(1) It is necessary to have Germany make a protest, explaining its current attitude towards disarmament and the League of Nations.</p>
<p>(2) If Germany proposes a proposal within the scope of disarmament discussions, a four-power conference should be convened immediately to consider Germany's position.</p>
<p>(3) If Germany proposes proposals outside of disarmament issues, such as the Polish Corridor issue, then the overall situation will become more complicated, and the four-power conference will become more difficult.</p>
<p>(4) The four powers must first draft a disarmament pact when they meet.</p>
<p>(5) Whether Germany returns to the League of Nations or not will depend entirely on its current demands.</p>
<p>It is also heard that Mussolini and Drummond agreed that since Germany withdrew from the League of Nations due to disarmament, its return to the League of Nations should also be based on disarmament. In other words, the current scope of discussion should not be expanded to include proposals such as revising the Treaty of Versailles. (28th National Dispatch)</p>
<p>Reuters in Rome learned from a high-ranking official today that the disarmament conference cannot make progress until Germany declares its demands. The rumors spread by foreign newspapers that Mussolini intends to organize a seven-power conference, including Japan, to seek world peace are unfounded. It is heard that Mussolini is willing to revise the League of Nations Covenant in the hope that the United States, Russia, and Japan can all join, but he has not yet put forward any suggestions on this matter, because the international tension was very high last month, and it was not yet the right time. If this plan is implemented, the seven major countries will naturally join the League of Nations. This theory has obviously given rise to the theory of seven-power coordination. At the same time, it is heard that the British Ambassador to Italy, Drummond, did not mention this plan when he met with Mussolini. His talks were limited to the hope that France and Germany would reach a compromise on the disarmament plan, and the procedures for bilateral talks advocated by Simon. All parties are now spreading rumors that German Ambassador Dr. Hassel is returning, because they believe that Hassel will be carrying Hitler's latest proposal. (29th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Russian Foreign Minister Visits Italy</h3>
<p>Rome hears that the most important task of Soviet Russian Foreign Commissioner Litvinov's visit to Rome this time is to formally sign the Russian-Italian Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression, which was signed in the first letter at the beginning of this year. In addition, it seems that the following issues will be discussed: (1) Disarmament, because the general stability of the Russian border can greatly contribute to general disarmament. (2) The consensus between Russia, Turkey, and Greece to form an Eastern and Mediterranean group. This ideal has made great progress recently. (3) Italy is eager to increase its imports of Russian raw materials and sell machinery and textiles to Russia. The Italian Interior Minister also wants to bring Russia into the ranks of European countries and not let it be isolated. (29th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Averoff Returns to Geneva</h3>
<p>(Geneva) After returning from Rome, League of Nations Secretary-General Averoff was reliably learned today to be of the opinion that Italy would only request revisions to the League of Nations treaty and procedures. There is no intention to withdraw from the League. It is expected a decision will be made around the 5th of next month when the Fascist Party convenes a major conference. Mr. Averoff declined to comment on his talks with the Italian Prime Minister and key Fascist figures in Rome, but well-informed sources have stated that Mussolini told Averoff that Italy's desire to withdraw from the League would be conditional on revisions. The revisions Mussolini desires mainly concern Article 19, which would allow treaty modifications to be implemented with a majority vote instead of the current requirement of unanimous consent. Furthermore, he wants to expand the Four-Power Pact to include Russia, or both Russia and Japan, and make minor modifications so that the powers can consult with each other in the spirit of the League of Nations without being confined to its structure. (28th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Mr. Averoff, is slightly indisposed today and therefore unable to report on the results of his recent trip to Rome. It is hoped that he will recover fully within a day to travel to London, as Mr. Averoff is scheduled to address the British House of Commons next week. (28th National Telegram)</p>

<h3>Britain Expands Air Force: 10,000 More Aircraft; 10 More Air Squadrons</h3>
<p>(London) Both houses of Parliament will debate the British air force today. All parties are calling for an expansion of the air force to prevent it from remaining in fifth place worldwide. At the same time, a proposal will be made to divert the funds for building six battleships to the construction of 10,000 aircraft and to immediately establish ten additional air squadrons. Ten years ago, the British government considered the minimum acceptable strength of the air force to be 52 squadrons, but this target has never been met. Following Germany's withdrawal from the Disarmament Conference and the League of Nations, a war cloud has settled over Europe. Various sectors in Britain are demanding the expansion of the British air force because major British cities, including London, are at risk of being attacked by the air forces of any continental European country. These air forces, after bombing, can fly back to their bases without refueling. (29th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<h3>Drafting New Financial Plan: French Cabinet Maintains Its Mandate; To Submit to Parliament This Weekend</h3>
<p>(Paris) The new cabinet held a cabinet meeting and decided to make its first appearance in Parliament on Saturday, at which time it will submit a finalized financial plan to the Chamber of Deputies. A cabinet meeting will also be held on Saturday morning to finalize the wording of the cabinet's policy statement. Regarding the discussion of the financial plan, the government is requesting the Chamber of Deputies to adopt an emergency procedure so that discussions can begin as early as the 7th of next month. The details of the plan are not yet known to the outside world, but given the current situation, only one approach is likely to be accepted by a majority of members and make it easier for the entire financial plan to be passed: it is a request for Parliament to grant the government the necessary powers to carry out administrative reforms by decree. These decrees must be approved by a "High Commission for Economy" with civil servant participation, and must be subsequently ratified by the Chamber of Deputies. (28th Havas Telegram)</p>

<h3>Austria Apologizes to Germany for Shooting of German Soldiers</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Several German Wehrmacht soldiers were skiing near the German-Austrian border when they were shot at by Austrian border guards, resulting in the death of one German Wehrmacht soldier. Germany lodged a strong protest with the Austrian government. Today, the Austrian ambassador to Berlin visited the German Foreign Office and expressed the Austrian government's apology to Foreign Minister Neurath on behalf of the Austrian government. However, regarding responsibility, they stated that they wish to reserve judgment pending the results of a formal investigation. At the same time, Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss also visited the German ambassador in Vienna and made the same expression. According to the German side, the incident occurred entirely within German territory, dozens of feet from Austrian soil, and the German Wehrmacht soldiers who were skiing in the area were completely unarmed, so there was no reason for the Austrian border guards to fire live ammunition.

<h3>American Finances: Income Does Not Cover Expenditures; Treasury Deposits Are Decreasing Daily; Wall Street Optimistic About Commercial Upturn</h3>
<p>(New York) The U.S. government is determined to continue its monetary policy, regardless of all criticism, as evidenced by the renewed rise in domestic gold prices. However, a few days ago, the advisory committee of the Federal Reserve Board passed a resolution strongly opposing this monetary policy and calling for a swift return to the gold standard. There are rumors that the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board is about to resign, but those involved have not confirmed this. For several weeks, the Treasury's expenditures have far exceeded its income, and this deficit is only increasing. Although the Treasury has 11.5 billion dollars in deposits, given the current spending situation, this amount will decrease daily and will not be sufficient to cover expenses within half a year. If the government cannot obtain the necessary funds from the private sector, then there are two possible outcomes: either it will stop all spending and suffer serious consequences, or it will issue banknotes to finance government expenses, in other words, engage in an unlimited policy of monetary inflation.

<h3>U.S. Cotton Shipments to China: Only 52,000 Bales Through October</h3>
<p>(New York) Although the Chinese government is keeping the details of its cotton purchases in the United States under the cotton-wheat loan a secret, statistics from the New York Cotton Exchange today reveal that the amount purchased seems to be very small. As of October 28, only 52,000 bales of cotton had been shipped to China, which is 9,000 bales less than the same period last year when there was no cotton-wheat loan. Furthermore, in the same period in 1931, a total of 244,000 bales of cotton were shipped to China. The cotton-wheat loan is intended to purchase cotton worth 40 million U.S. dollars. Assuming a price of one dime per pound, this could purchase 800,000 bales. However, only 52,000 bales have been shipped to China so far, which, even if all were purchased by the Chinese government, would be less than 6% of the total amount. American cotton industry insiders are well aware of the difficulties facing the Chinese government, as it is a time of abundant cotton harvests in the Far East and Chinese cotton is currently selling at 20% less than American cotton. Currently, Chinese procurement personnel are keeping the details of their purchases secret. Even regarding the 52,000 bales shipped to China, they are not disclosing how many were purchased by the Chinese government, only admitting that recent purchases and shipments have not been large, for fear of disrupting the Chinese cotton market and to avoid being manipulated by cotton industry insiders here and in other countries.

China is still working to create such a political system, and asks all countries to be patient. There is no country in the world that can compare with China, because China is a vital artery for global commerce and can gradually recover from this.

He also noted that lawyers who have been released on bail often still appear in the court's civil division to represent litigation in civil cases. He asked if it is possible to prohibit them from appearing in court, since there is no express provision in the current laws to base it on. If they are allowed to continue to perform their duties without prohibition, then within the same court, they are being tried in the criminal court for criminal suspicion, while still receiving the treatment of a lawyer in the civil court. This not only fails to rectify discipline, but also damages dignity. The ministry stated that any lawyer suspected of committing a criminal offense who is detained during the criminal proceedings should be temporarily suspended from performing lawyer duties, except for those who can be bailed out. However, if they are sentenced to imprisonment or detention, they should also be suspended from performing their duties, even before the judgment is final. He ordered the Jiangsu High Court to be informed. (29th Special Telegram)</p>

<h3>American Journalist Discusses Pacific Situation: Findings from a Four-Month Inspection, Suggests Three Approaches for the United States, Should Ally with Britain and Russia If Not Pro-Japan</h3>
<p>Upton Close, a well-known American journalist, recently inspected China, Japan, the Philippines, Hawaii, and other places for four months and returned. He wrote an article commenting on the extremely dangerous situation in the Pacific, believing that the United States has only three possible paths: either ignore the threats from Japan and pay no attention, or revise immigration laws and correct unnecessary insults to the Japanese, or cooperate extensively with Britain and Russia to clearly show Japan that there are preparations. If it is not to close its borders, or be pro-Japanese, then it is better to ally with Britain and Russia to restrain the Japanese. This article was published in the Vancouver Sun of Canada.</p>
<p>It roughly states: I have just returned from investigating the international and national crisis brewing in the Pacific in the Far East for four months. I have witnessed Soviet diplomats deeply convinced that a war between Japan and Russia is imminent, and the Red Army is preparing with efforts that surpass humanity. At present, there are 125,000 Red Army soldiers in the Outer Baikal region, which is the largest number that the Soviet Union dares to deploy there before it can obtain supplies from the United States or other places on the Pacific coast. As a result, the civilians in the area are now on the verge of starvation. The Golden Horn in Vladivostok Bay has also become a naval beehive, and submarine materials newly transported from steel plants in central Siberia are being assembled. Once a preparation is completed, any of the ten or so outstanding issues between Japan and Russia can be used to incite hostilities with Japan. Japan certainly wants to wait until the spring and warmer days for war, but Russia would rather wait until the deep winter, because it can use Lake Baikal and the Heilong and Songhua Rivers to assist in the transportation of the Siberian Railway. However, Soviet politicians are also quite determined not to allow Russia to fight Japan alone. They fear that the ultimate goal of the Japanese militarists is to force the United States to abandon its traditional Western Pacific policy of over a hundred years and replace it with Japan's Asian Monroe Doctrine. Therefore, they hope that the existing diplomatic conflicts between Tokyo and Washington will expand and lead to a break.</p>
<p>I also saw the commercial aggression of the Japanese, which is victorious everywhere, and is used to provide financial resources for the expansion of the empire and the huge budget of the army and navy. In the Philippines, after the last U.S. Congress clearly told them in the Philippine independence bill that it would stop purchasing their products, its farmers have secretly hoped to obtain a suitable position in the economic empire of Japan's expanding activities. The U.S. Army and Navy in the Philippines are unable to make much noise against Japan's future expansion, and the situation is like Spain's defense of Cuba in 1898. In China, under the control of students who studied in Japan, they are hesitating and deliberating whether they can obtain effective assistance from the United States before their political and economic independence is completely subjugated to the Japanese. As for the Japanese government, it is now completely under the control of the pro-war faction, and the "central cabinet" composed of the army, navy, foreign affairs, and finance ministries governs everything. Its people are completely anesthetized by the propaganda of the newspapers controlled by the Ministry of the Army, and no cabinet is allowed to rein in the movement to build the empire, reverse the course, and return to the original path. Therefore, young assassins who assassinate their hesitant officials are now regarded as national heroes. I saw that the Japanese who were good at boasting and holding the weight of the country believed that they were all blessed with good luck. No matter how risky and obstructed, they would never fail if they acted now. At the same time, the whole world, especially the United States, is under the doom and cannot stop the actions of the Japanese.</p>
<p>As for Hawaii, after the attempt to unite the yellow and white races under the economic recovery movement failed, it became discouraged and entered a state of paralysis in politics, waiting to be deprived of the power of its people's representative government (according to the US government, there was a proposal that the president could send non-islanders to be the governor of the island, but it was not passed by Congress). The islanders who have already realized this are all sympathetic to the claims of the army and navy, believing that the mixed residence of Japanese nationals with dual citizenship on the island is an intolerable situation for US national defense.</p>
<p>Since this summer, the history of the Pacific has changed rapidly. Japan has openly declared that its naval ratio will no longer be able to safely stay at three-fifths of the British and American navies, which it has been holding. It has launched an open attack on the business of advanced industrial countries. The US government has also abandoned its belief that treaties are sufficient to protect territorial interests, and has begun to build warships in large numbers, determined to make its naval strength equal to that of Japan. Moreover, the United States' policy of not paying attention to the Soviet Union for fifteen years has also been abandoned. Furthermore, Japan has given naval officers the power to trample on treaties made by its government, making it impossible for any self-respecting country to sign arms limitation agreements with Japanese diplomats.</p>
<p>After I pointed out this dangerous situation in the Pacific, I was often asked straightforwardly, "Do you think there will be a war between Japan and the United States? If there is a war, when will it be?" This kind of straightforward question often leads to complex answers. Therefore, I tried to propose several premises and strive for their straightforwardness, so that the questioner can draw his own conclusions.</p>
<p>Premise 1: Japan's militarists seem to no longer be able to hope that it will collapse from within. They firmly believe that they are now under auspicious stars, and can take any risks in order to establish hegemony in the Pacific west of Hawaii once and for all, and absolutely control the politics and economy of mainland China. The funds they need can be obtained from these places and the trade seized in the remote territories of European empires. The Japanese people are deeply convinced by propaganda and pleasing words that Japan will succeed. White countries, especially Britain, will decline, and will not allow their governments to hesitate, delay, or retreat from the movement to expand the empire and establish power.</p>
<p>Premise 2: As far as the U.S. government is concerned, it is doubtful whether it can take completely opposite actions in its Pacific policy so that Japan no longer feels that the United States is a threat to its ambitions. Because in today's situation, if you want to truly establish Japanese-American friendship, you must abandon the open-door policy, recognize Japan's territory obtained in violation of treaties, and no longer give any spiritual assistance to China, and you must fully agree to the Japanese request to prohibit American merchants from selling aircraft to China, and prohibit Americans from teaching aviation technology to the Chinese, and you must not lend loans or cotton and wheat to China in the future without the consent of the Japanese. At the same time, the United States must not take any actions that would encourage its Pacific resistance to the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Premise 3: Furthermore, it is also doubtful whether the US government will accept Japan's conditions for joining the naval limitation after 1935. These conditions are: (1) Absolute equality, abandoning the theory that Japan's national defense line is shorter and only needs three-fifths of the British and American navies to protect it; (2) Recognizing Japan as the master of the Pacific Islands under its mandate. However, even if the US government is willing to make these two concessions, it will not be able to establish a contractual relationship with a country that retains the right to unilaterally abolish the treaty once the militarists believe that the situation is urgent. Moreover, on the American side, more and more people in the State Department and the Army and Navy believe that the United States has been deceived by the current naval restrictions. According to their view, Japanese patriots are angry at their politicians for signing the Washington and London treaties, which harmed the country, while at the same time secretly laughing at the Americans for being deceived and for the benefit of the Japanese. These two treaties can enable Japan to follow larger naval countries without worrying about provoking a naval arms race. The naive Hoover government therefore deeply believed that war and war materials had become a thing of the past. At the same time, the Japanese royal war faction is rapidly advancing its imperial plan. Furthermore, Japan has been able to make considerable preparations by acting as a trustee of the Pacific Islands. According to American Rear Admiral Stanley, its effectiveness is equal to setting up bases throughout the Pacific. If the US Navy takes corresponding actions, it will be accused of violating the treaty because of the two treaties.</p>
<p>Premise 4: If the United States continues the policies described in the second premise, then the Chinese people's resistance to Japanese control will continue unabated. If the Chinese can resist the Japanese sufficiently and for a long time, it will be enough to make the Japanese bleed to death. If they want to guard another largest area, such as Manchuria, even if they exhaust all of Japan's standing army, they will still worry that it will not be enough. From Japan's point of view, it seems less dangerous to take a risk against the United States than other countries. This is still following the mentality of suddenly attacking Russia without declaring war in 1904. At that time, the object of the Japanese was Korea, not Russia, but they believed that Korea could not succumb to Japan unless the Russians could no longer incite Korean resistance. It should be noted that the Japanese understanding always proceeds along the path of anatomy.</p>
<p>We hope that the parties concerned will make a smart examination based on the actual situation and current psychology based on the above four premises. It is hoped that this is extremely slim. According to my judgment, I am afraid that these two layers cannot be done at all. If we cannot examine based on the actual situation, then the development in the Pacific will only tend towards the most violent armed conflict, and Japan's ambitions will consume its finances, because until now its financial resources have all relied on its trade aggression against the world market. If the great powers find a way to temporarily stop its aggression, then Japan will only be forced to find a way out earlier.</p>
<p>If Russia opens hostilities earlier than the United States today, the situation will be extremely tense. Can the United States allow Japan to defeat Russia again? If President Roosevelt helps Japan to fight against Russia, then what will happen to Russia? As for other countries, the British will maintain their traditional attitude. Although they sympathize with the United States, they believe that since the Americans have come out to fight, the British do not need to join and can watch from the sidelines and reap the benefits. However, for the sake of its colonies and its basic sympathy for the United States, it naturally wants the United States to win. France will not be so straightforward if it can measure it. If possible, it will be more secretive than the British. Is this a tragic scene? Since you want me to describe it directly, even if I am not good at it, at least I should not wear colored glasses. There is a proverb: "There is no happiness in the garden of fools." How wise are these words!</p>
<p>The United States is rapidly approaching the most serious crisis in its history, and Japan is also impossible to persuade under its current leaders. There are only three ways to change this situation: (1) At this time, the American people should no longer worry about their own survival and leave it to nature; (2) The United States frankly changes its policy and gives the Japanese hegemony west of Hawaii, as they requested; (3) The United States urgently makes up for its shortcomings and creates its own resistance. There are also three points in this regard: (1) "Correcting" the unnecessary humiliation of the Japanese in the Immigration Act of 1924, giving the Japanese a very small immigration quota; (2) Vigorously developing the faithful cooperation of Britain, Russia and the United States to contain the world's most recent threats; (3) Clearly inform Japan of the US position and its readiness to maintain this position.</p>
<h3>After the Fujian Incident, Important Figures from All Sides Arrive in Jiangxi to Meet Chiang Kai-shek to Discuss Matters Concerning Fujian</h3>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: After the Fujian Incident, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek could not leave Jiangxi due to the tense situation of suppressing the Red Army. Regarding the strategy for dealing with the current situation, the Nanjing Central Committee members telegraphed Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to discuss the matter. Military and political figures from all sides came to Jiangxi to meet Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in an endless stream. Their whereabouts are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Yang Dezhao</h3>
<p>Yang Dezhao, representative of Chen Jitang of Guangdong Province, arrived in Nanchang from Xun by Nanxun Road train at around 10:00 PM on the 25th. He met Chiang Kai-shek at around 10:00 AM on the 26th, reporting on the attitude of the Southwest Central Committee members after the Fujian Incident, Chen Jitang's strategy for dealing with the Fujian Incident, the defense situation in the Northeast Jiangxi and Chaoshan areas, and requested the Central Government to provide support and assistance in order to quell the rebellion under the guidance of the Central Government. Chiang Kai-shek gave instructions. Yang stayed in the province for several days. According to Yang, Chen and Li's rebellion in Fujian abandoned the people of the country and their destruction can be expected soon. Guangdong is absolutely supportive of the Central Government in securing internal stability and resisting foreign aggression. Guangxi Province is also consistent with Guangdong. As for whether Hu will come to Beijing, there is no definite news because he did not meet him when he passed through Hong Kong, but Hu will never destroy his past history and naturally hates Fujian, and so on.</p>
<h3>Huang Jianping</h3>
<p>Huang Jianping, representative of Li Zongren of Guangxi Province, arrived in the province at Chiang Kai-shek's summons the second day after the Fujian Incident to inquire about everything. Chiang Kai-shek also instructed him to convey to Li and Bai the importance of the overall situation of the party and the country, to jointly suppress the rebellion and avoid causing division. According to Huang's statement, the general idea was "I奉李委員德鄰命代表來京、出席團防會議、旋又奉蔣委員長命來贛、報告一切、此次閩省異動、事先陳銘樞曾派代表謁見李德鄰先生、李即聲明服從中央、不參加任何組織、以啓糾紛、並勸陳解散第三黨社會民主黨等反動集團、以示覺悟、無奈陳個性大强、執迷不悟、現李德鄰先生、埋頭於安内攘外兩大目標、關於安内、曾擬定五年建設計劃、逐步實施、桂省歲入二千萬、行政軍費及建設三項攤分、建設頗有進展、而民團進步亦速、匪患業已絶跡、至於邊防、因桂接近强鄰、不得不事先綢繆、以免外人覬覦云云、</p>
<h3>Ma Chaojun</h3>
<p>Ma Chaojun, a member of the Central Committee, arrived in Xun by China Airlines plane from Beijing on the 25th and took a car to Nanchang that day to meet Chiang Kai-shek and report on important central government policies. It is said that he also discussed the issue of welcoming Hu Zhan Tang to Beijing.</p>
<h3>Yang Hu</h3>
<p>Yang Hu, the director of the Shanghai Security Department, also came to Jiangxi yesterday to report to Chiang on the public security situation in Shanghai and to ask for instructions. Yang told reporters that all the Central Committee members expressed sympathy for welcoming Hu to Beijing. Ma Chaojun is here in Jiangxi to discuss this matter. Although it is not certain whether Hu will go to Beijing, the Fujian side has destroyed the party and betrayed the country, and the comrades of our party have reached the stage of resisting foreign aggression. Chen and Li's actions can promote the unity of the Southwest and the Central Government.</p>
<h3>Zhu Peide</h3>
<p>Zhu Peide was invited to Jiangxi by Chiang's telegram to discuss the military deployment to deal with the Fujian Incident. It is said that he has already embarked on a ship from Beijing and will arrive in the province in a day or two.</p>
<h3>Bao Yulin</h3>
<p>Bao Yulin, a member of the Standing Committee of the Beiping Military Commission, arrived in the province from Beijing on the 24th. According to him, he came here to report to Chiang on the military and political situation in North China. The Northeast generals will definitely support the Central Government in suppressing the rebellion in the Fujian Incident. It is said that Bao will stay in the province for several days to discuss the military and political arrangements in the Northeast. Wan Fulin will also come to Jiangxi after Bao to ask Chiang for instructions on everything.</p>
<h3>Autopsy Performed After Death from Injury in Songjiang</h3>
<p>Li Santang, a villager from Panjiaku Village, Caoging, Punam, went to question Zhu Bingsheng of the same village on the 22nd day of the eighth lunar month about insulting his daughter. The two sides went from verbal argument to fighting. Li suffered minor injuries and was unwilling to accept the situation. The next day, he filed a complaint with the county prosecutor's office, summoning Zhu Bingsheng for interrogation. Because there were signs of injury, a public prosecution was initiated. As a result, Zhu Bingsheng was fined fifteen yuan and paid Li Santang fifteen yuan for medical expenses. However, Li returned to his hometown and became ill due to the injury. Doctors were consulted, but the medicine was ineffective. He died on the 24th day of the tenth lunar month. There was much discussion outside, and Zhu Bingsheng feared that there would be complications, so he took the initiative to surrender to the Songjiang case. The prosecutor ordered him to be detained and sent a police officer to bring Li's coffin to Songjiang, which was temporarily placed at the foot of the East Gate. The prosecutor led a royal coroner and also invited Zhang Shaoxiu, the director of Songjiang Hospital, and Ke Deqiong, the director of Deqiong Hospital, to go for inspection on the morning of today (29th) at 9:00 AM. First, he ordered the coffin lid to be opened and found black spots on Lesu's body, red spots on the lower abdomen, and blood stains at the anus. According to the doctors' observations, it did not seem to be related to the beating. The black spots on the body were a phenomenon that must appear after the coffin was closed. The red spots on the abdomen may have been spots that appeared before his death. Anus blood is often a symptom of cold disease. The coroner believed that there was no injury and filled in the corpse format to be submitted for approval.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Vegetable Market Dispute Comes to an End</h3>
<p>The shops in the Daoyuan Street and Yuyu Lane inside the Xumen Gate publicly elected representatives to petition various agencies and staged another strike because the Public Security Bureau's oppression of vegetable vendors affected traffic and business. On the evening of the 28th, the county chamber of commerce resolved the mediation method: (1) Shops can still trade with vegetable vendors if they are placed in the store, but they must be banned according to regulations if they are placed on the sidewalk. (2) Cancel the deployment of police officers at the entrances of various alleys. Vegetable vendors can pass freely. The chairman, Shi Junqing, went to various shops to persuade them. The shops resumed operations at 7:00 PM that night, and the storm came to an end. Hong Yongkun and others, the merchants recognized in the vegetable market, also automatically cancelled the original fee of two yuan per stall for building sheds, one yuan for deposit, and one yuan and four corners for monthly rent. The monthly rent will be reduced to eight cents, and will be collected again starting from New Year's Day next year.</p>
<h3>The Tragic News of an Abused and Beaten Foster Daughter Dying in Wuxi</h3>
<p>In the third district of the county (Yangming Township), near Miaobiao, in the village of Xicao, a farmer named Hu Gengquan, 48 years old, lived in impoverished circumstances. His wife, Zhou, 41 years old, had four sons and four daughters, the eldest already past twenty, and the youngest still an infant. In the second month of the lunar calendar this year, a woman named Wang Zhao from Benniu, Changzhou, sold her eight-year-old daughter, Qiaoyun, to Hu Gengquan as a foster daughter due to poverty. After Qiaoyun entered the Hu family, she was immediately forced to work at the Tai Fu Silk Factory. During holidays, she was also made to do housework. If she did not perform to their satisfaction, she was immediately beaten. She was repeatedly flogged. On the evening of the second day of this lunar month, for reasons unknown, Hu Gengquan severely beat her again. At that time, she cried out in pain, and neighbors, hearing the cries, came to persuade him to stop, but he continued to whip her relentlessly. The temples on her head were struck and broken, causing profuse bleeding, which led to her being bedridden, moaning and groaning. Those who heard her were saddened. She lingered until midnight on the fourth day of the month when she succumbed to her injuries. After her death, Gengquan and his wife did not prepare a coffin for her. Instead, they bound her body with rice straw and buried it in a wartime trench dug by soldiers in Dasong Tomb area on Yangming Road, about half a li away. Yesterday morning, a wild dog digging in the ditch unearthed the head. Passersby caught a glimpse of a child's corpse and reported it to Ye Jigen, the head of the thirteenth tu (a unit of administration) in that area. He went to investigate and recognized the body as Qiaoyun's, with bloodstains still visible on her head. Subsequently, the third sub-bureau of the local public security bureau dispatched police officers to arrest Hu Gengquan and bring him to the main bureau. At the same time, the tu head reported the incident to the county court, which scheduled a field investigation for today. Also, in Caozhuang, near Anzhen in the eighth district, a farmer named Sun Wubao tilled the land of Dai Zhou Zuwang as a tenant farmer. On the 26th of this month, Zhou Zuwang went to Sun's house to demand rent but received nothing. He then proceeded to cut the rice crop in Sun's field. In desperation, Sun Wubao, coupled with a quarrel with his wife, in a moment of anger, secretly hanged himself. Yesterday, the tu head Zhou Jifu reported the matter to the county prosecutor's office for an autopsy and coffin preparation.</p>
<h3>A Blind Elderly Woman in Jiashan Tragically Burned to Death</h3>
<p>An elderly woman, surnamed Lu, in the Yu Hui Zhen Jia Bang area north of the town, was very old and blind. The other day, her children and grandchildren were all working in the fields, leaving only the elderly woman at home to prepare breakfast. For some reason, she mistakenly ignited the rice straw and stuffed it under her crotch, causing her skirt and trousers to catch fire. She screamed for help, but no one responded. She collapsed to the ground, rolling around until she died. After her death, her entire body was charred and unrecognizable. It was truly a tragic event.</p>

<h3>This City News: Li Liejun Meets with Reporters Yesterday to Express His Views on the Current Situation. Resolving the Fujian Crisis Requires First Addressing Its Root Causes.</h3>
<p>A Far Eastern News Agency report stated that since the Fujian incident, Central Committee member Li Liejun had previously sent a letter to Chairman Chiang of the Military Affairs Commission, offering suggestions on dealing with the Fujian matter and opening up the government. Li has now received a reply from Chiang, the contents of which will be officially released soon. Yesterday morning, Li met with reporters from various newspapers at his private residence on Rue Massenet, issuing a written statement saying that some opinions attributed to him in the recent newspapers were inaccurate. It was merely hearsay. Few people outside knew about the brewing of the Fujian incident. It was not until the declaration was issued and the People's Government was organized that people began to understand the general situation. When some asked about the Fujian situation, he did not discuss it. (Omission)...The independence of Fujian has caused pain to those who care about national affairs. However, the principles it espouses, such as opening up the party ban and making the government open, are considered the natural requirements of law and politics and the rights that the people should enjoy. But even the national flag was changed, which was inappropriate. The points that he focuses on in the current situation are to eliminate internal strife, to return to harmony, and to value the intelligence of the people and their rights. Therefore, he has always advocated freeing the people from restrictions on speech, publication, assembly, and association, so that they can freely organize political parties and express their intelligence. This is the fundamental key to internal stability and external resistance. The Kuomintang's strength is expanding, and its will is so inconsistent. There is no need to force them to separate or to force them to unite. He hopes that wise people in the country can work together for peace regarding the Fujian issue. However, he fears that his shallow views will not be effective, so he is just advocating it. A few days ago, he sent letters everywhere, strongly arguing the matter. If Fujian does not rush to attack Zhejiang at this time, and the central government does not rush to attack Fujian, then peace is not without hope.</p>
<h3>A Central Committee Member's Remarks on Observing the Fujian Mutiny</h3>
<p>A Far Eastern News Agency report stated that the Fujian incident has been going on for ten days. After the incident, the central government originally intended to quickly resolve it through political means to avoid war and harming the country's vitality. However, in recent days, the Fujian side has shown no signs of repentance and is actively preparing for war, posing a great threat to Zhejiang. Political resolution and peaceful mediation have practically become hopeless. On the central government's side, in order to maintain its authority, it will authorize Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the Military Affairs Commission to issue an official order to suppress the rebellion. A reporter from the Far Eastern News Agency, therefore, specifically visited a Central Committee member yesterday to inquire about the development and results of this matter. According to the discussion, at the beginning of the brewing of the Fujian incident, he suggested to the central government to quickly open up the government. (Omission)...We must know that if politics are bad, there is naturally no way to get on the right track. If politics are not on the right track, then disputes will arise. What past coups were not caused by this? The Fujian mutiny is just one of them. Moreover, any incident must have its source. Those who are good at responding to changes should trace the source, analyze it one by one, examine it from an objective perspective, and then deal with it from a subjective perspective. Things will not fail. If one only has a subjective view of oneself and does not see objective others, it is like untangling silk: the more you try to untangle it, the more tangled it becomes. Therefore, we believe that the occurrence of the Fujian incident and</p>
<h3>The Future Handling</h3>
<p>of the matter should also start from this point. If we rely on our own opinions, or even act impulsively and rashly due to emotional impulses, it will be very destructive and will involve more and more people, making it impossible to end well. Fujian is a barren area, less than one-twentieth of Guangdong. Now that an independent government has been organized, the government expenses are huge, which cannot be compared with the government expenses of a province in the past. Moreover, the 19th Route Army has always relied on the central government and Guangdong for financial support. According to reports, it has now expanded to as many as five armies. With such a barren province, once the number of troops increases so much, there will be no source of supply. If the Fujian incident cannot be resolved through</p>
<h3>Political Channels</h3>
<p>the 19th Route Army will have to attack Zhejiang immediately to find a way out. On the central government's side, in order to maintain its authority, it will have to carry out suppression. If the 19th Route Army invades Zhejiang, then war will be difficult to avoid, and the war will bring suffering to the people and harm the country's vitality. We cannot help but worry about the country's future. For the current plan, he believes that political resolution is not yet hopeless. He hopes that both sides will consider the future of the country and the nation, abandon personal prejudices, be open and honest, and discuss the matter at length, which will be helpful. Otherwise, he cannot bear to say it.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Public Security Bureau Orders Guards to Conduct Special Inspections. All Staff Members of the Bureau Must Also Be Inspected. Special Attention Should Be Paid at Night and Secret Notices Should Be Issued.</h3>
<p>A National News Agency report stated that since the Fujian provincial coup, the authorities in this port, because of the mixed population from all directions, are deeply afraid that reactionary elements will take the opportunity to stir up trouble. Therefore, martial law was declared immediately as a precautionary measure. Recently, the head of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Wen Hong'en, in order to protect local public order, in addition to contacting the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters, the Municipal Security Office Security Team, and the Nanshi Zhabei Security Corps and other agencies, specially implemented winter prevention early from the 23rd of this month. In order to be cautious, starting yesterday, all cars entering and leaving the bureau's main gate and road were ordered to be thoroughly checked by the guards of the police brigade stationed at the east and west intersections. Otherwise, they will not be allowed to pass. Special attention should be paid at night. Even officials and staff members of the bureau coming and going on night duty must be inspected. Notice has been given to all district offices, teams, and sections to comply and conduct strict inspections.</p>
<h3>Luo Wen'gan Came to Shanghai Yesterday. The Head of the Second Branch of the High Court Visited Him. He Returned to Beijing by Train at 11 PM Last Night.</h3>
<p>Judicial Administration Minister Luo Wen'gan, after his inspection tour of Xinjiang, rushed to Beijing and Jiangxi to report everything to the central government and Chairman Chiang. He has also resigned from his concurrent position as Minister of Foreign Affairs to specialize in judicial affairs. It is learned that Luo has concrete plans for national courts and prisons at all levels and will gradually deliberate and implement them. At 7:30 yesterday morning, Luo arrived in Shanghai from Beijing and stayed at the Cangzhou Hotel. Shen Jiayi, the head of the Second Branch of the High Court, specially visited him by car at around 11:00 yesterday morning and was immediately received. Luo inquired in detail about the situation of the courts. In the afternoon, Luo went out to visit friends and handle personal matters. Last night, he took the 11:00 PM night train back to Beijing.</p>
<h3>The Sino-French-Vietnamese Treaty Has Stalled. Rumors That It Will Be Signed Soon Are Inaccurate.</h3>
<p>A Central News Agency report stated that the signing of the Sino-French-Vietnamese commercial treaty has been repeatedly negotiated by our foreign affairs authorities and French Minister Wilden, but because the French side has strongly disputed the tax rate standards, it has not been resolved so far. According to reliable sources, the negotiations have stalled and will be difficult to progress this year. Another report stated that French Minister Wilden went south a few days ago and consulted with concurrently Foreign Minister Wang on this outstanding issue, requesting a solution. Although the French Minister was insistent on the tax rate standards, he drafted a document and asked both governments for instructions. Rumors that the treaty would be signed in Beijing soon are not true.</p>
<h3>The New British Ambassador to China Is Scheduled to Arrive. Departs on January 26th and Arrives in Shanghai on February 28th.</h3>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from London on November 28th reported that the newly appointed British Ambassador to China, Sir Hughe Montgomery Knatchbull-Hugessen, will depart for China with his wife and children on the P&amp;O liner SS Stratheden on January 26th next year to take up his new post. He is expected to arrive in Shanghai on February 28th. A correspondent for the North China Daily News visited him today. Knatchbull-Hugessen briefly outlined his plans after arriving in China, saying that he planned to stay in Shanghai for a short time and then go to Beijing. However, he still intends to return to Shanghai before going north. He also said that he was very interested in his new position. The London China Association has scheduled a farewell banquet for Knatchbull-Hugessen on December 13th.</p>
<h3>All Brokers of the Cotton and Cloth Exchange Held an Emergency Meeting Yesterday. A Total of 58 Broker Representatives Attended. Important Proposals Such As Declarations and Petitions Were Passed. An Opinion on Rescuing the Cotton Industry Was Released.</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Cotton and Cloth Exchange, due to an order from the Ministry of Industry refusing to accept new cotton, caused a three-day suspension of auctions. After the Ministry of Industry sent representatives to discuss the matter with both parties, auctions resumed as usual. However, business at the exchange has been sluggish in recent days, and brokers have felt it difficult to cope. Therefore, at 3:00 PM yesterday, a general meeting of all brokers was convened at the exchange market to discuss countermeasures. A total of 58 broker representatives attended. Zhu Guangcheng chaired the meeting and reported the purpose of the meeting. Then, proposals such as declarations and petitions were passed.</p>
<h3>Declarations and Petitions Passed</h3>
<p>Chairman Zhu Guangcheng reported, roughly stating that the number of attendees now totaled 58, which met the required number for the meeting. Since the exchange received the Ministry's order refusing to accept new cotton, it has been difficult to gain the trust of customers, and business has been declining, which is enough to affect the business of our brokers. A temporary emergency meeting was convened today. He hoped that all members would express their opinions to facilitate the proceedings. After the report, the motions were passed: (1) The declaration was amended and passed. (2) The petition to the Ministry of Industry was passed. (3) The brokers' opinion on rescuing the cotton industry and the letter to the exchange were passed. The original texts passed are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Declaration of Suspending Futures Trading in Cotton Yarn</h3>
<p>Declaration by the General Association of Brokers of the Shanghai Chinese Cotton and Cloth Exchange: It is found that the decline of China's cotton industry in recent years is mainly due to the collapse of the domestic economy and the dumping of foreign goods at depreciated prices. It has long been known to enlightened people at home and abroad that there is no way to remedy it except by improving cotton production, enhancing textile skills, reducing the cost of spinning, and reviving the rural economy. As for the effectiveness of the exchange's futures trading, it is specifically to regulate supply and demand and equalize market prices, so that manufacturers and merchants can hedge their transactions to make budgets for their business operations. Therefore, the exchange's cotton prices have always been based on the actual production and sales situation and the supply and demand situation as the standard, which cannot be controlled by human power. Moreover, the rejection of new cotton by the exchange cannot achieve the purpose of stabilizing cotton prices. This time, the Ministry of Industry ordered the exchange to reject new cotton and not to provide for delivery, which is a temporary change to the delivery method for the November and December futures contracts, forcing buyers and sellers to perform old contracts according to the new rules. From now on, the business of our brokers and the transactions of customers will lose security. In addition to the association sending a letter to the exchange to forward it to the Ministry of Industry, requesting consideration of the commercial situation and granting a review, before the Ministry's reply is received, customers are watching and hesitating, and our brokers have nothing to rely on in their business and cannot provide normal service. Therefore, all members have decided to suspend the trading of new cotton yarn contracts for May next year, which is about to be launched, until security is obtained and then business is resumed. All these facts are sincerely declared for the public's information.</p>
<h3>The Government-Donated "Two Roads" Airplane Will Fly Along the Two Routes Today. All Stations Along the Two Routes Are Preparing to Welcome It.</h3>
<p>All employees of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways donated the "Two Roads" airplane to the government. The naming ceremony was held at Hongqiao Airport on the 11th of this month. The government sent representatives to receive it. It was originally scheduled to fly along the two routes the next day, but due to foggy weather, it was not convenient to fly and was temporarily suspended. Yesterday, the Two Roads Air Defense Fundraising Committee received a letter from the China Aviation Association stating that it had received a reply from the Aviation Administration stating that the aviation school has been ordered to send personnel to fly the "Two Roads" airplane along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway first and then the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway on the 30th of this month if the weather is good, in order to express gratitude and promote publicity. The association immediately telegraphed the special party department, the district party departments, and the stations along the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways to prepare to welcome it.</p>
<h3>Petition to the Ministry of Industry</h3>
<p>For the matter of petitioning: Previously, your ministry sent a telegram because the Cotton Industry Control Committee, in order to stabilize cotton prices, requested that the Shanghai Chinese Cotton and Cloth Exchange be ordered to refuse to accept new cotton. Therefore, an order was issued to the exchanges to comply. The exchange, upon receiving this, has posted it for all brokers to comply. At that time, representatives of the association, representing the brokers, stated that this was a pioneering initiative that was difficult to force customers to comply with, and that the brokers' business would lose security in the future. The exchange requested your ministry to grant a review, which is on record. It is found that stabilizing cotton prices, in maintaining the cotton industry, is a temporary measure, not a fundamental and essential plan. To implement it, manufacturers should be given financial assistance or their existing cotton should be purchased, so that Chinese factories will not have to sell at a loss. The purpose cannot be achieved simply by the exchange refusing to accept new cotton. The exchange was originally established to regulate supply and demand and equalize prices. The prices in the exchange must always be commensurate with the actual supply and demand situation at that time, which cannot be controlled by human power. Now, your ministry's telegram orders the refusal to accept new cotton, which makes it possible for existing cotton in the exchange to be monopolized for speculation. Not only will the cotton prices in the exchange no longer represent the actual supply and demand, but also because new cotton cannot be provided for delivery, its use will inevitably become narrower and the market price will fall further. Therefore, the result will be nothing more than raising cotton prices in the exchange and allowing cotton buyers to profit. Furthermore, according to Article 41 of the Exchange Law, your ministry is the supervisory authority, and if the exchange violates laws or regulations, or engages in acts that harm public interest or disturb public order, it can be punished with suspension of business, etc. However, this order to refuse to accept new cotton does not conform to the points listed in that article. It is found that all brokers in the exchange conduct business on behalf of customers. At the time of the customer's commission, they all expected that new cotton could be provided for delivery at the time. If new cotton is suddenly collected and old rules are changed, the position of profit and loss will be reversed, greatly deviating from the original expectation. It is difficult to force customers to perform contracts according to the new rules. This will damage the exchange's reputation, hinder the brokers' business, and have a far-reaching impact. Therefore, since receiving the telegram and posting it for compliance, customers have hesitated to move forward, and the industry has completely stalled. All brokers are concerned about their own interests and can no longer remain silent. Therefore, in accordance with the provisions of Article 2, Paragraph 6 of the Petition Law, a petition is filed with your ministry, requesting that you examine and approve the review, so that the lost credibility may be recovered, and the declining business may be revived. We are waiting and praying for this. Respectfully presented to the Ministry of Industry of the National Government.</p>
<h3>Opinions of Colleagues of the Cotton and Cloth Exchange on Rescuing the Cotton Industry</h3>
<p>Opinion book on rescuing the cotton industry from the Shanghai Chinese Cotton and Cloth Exchange Brokerage Association: Since the evil tide of economic panic swept the world, European and American countries have been advocating controlled economy domestically and dumping surplus goods externally. The first to bear the brunt of this is our country, which has an open door and is already a semi-colony. Although this year is touted as the Year of National Goods, foreign goods are being dumped even more severely, and the amount of imports will break all previous records. Under the economic oppression of these powers, the national economy and people's livelihood are already in an unthinkable state. Moreover, the loss of the Northeast market and the combination of foreign and domestic troubles have led to a serious situation of rural bankruptcy. Chinese cotton mills are facing a decline in cotton yarn sales and are unable to maintain themselves. Our government, in order to maintain this largest industry in our country, is aware of the difficulties of the yarn factory industry. The lack of raw cotton is also one of the main reasons. Therefore, it is taking advantage of the opportunity to borrow money in the United States to purchase cotton. In addition, because Shanghai is the center of the domestic yarn industry market, a Cotton Industry Control Committee has been established to regulate production and sales and improve cotton production, which is a good policy to benefit the industry. Recently, in order to stabilize cotton prices, the Control Committee obtained the approval of the Ministry of Industry to order the exchange to refuse to accept new cotton from November this year to November next year. The intention is to curb speculation and maintain yarn factories and weaving industries, which is also a painstaking effort. However, the exchange has encountered great difficulties because of this. The buying and selling of goods is a contractual relationship with customers. If the method is changed temporarily, it will not be possible to fulfill legally established contracts. Buyers and sellers will not know what to do, and a great panic will arise, resulting in a suspension of auctions. The exchange's position and mission are to equalize regulation and respond to supply and demand. If price changes are the trend of the times, there is no way to reverse it. As for the types of goods to be delivered, the only thing that can be done is to limit them to those that meet the pre-ordered grade list. It is up to the factory to take full responsibility for whether it meets the needs of society in order to be cautious in sales. Now that the exchange is involved, this rescue method does not seem to be proper. At that time, colleagues of the association requested the Ministry of Industry to consider the commercial situation and grant a review. Later, the Control Committee announced its purpose of being extremely considerate and helpful, and the exchange resumed trading immediately. This great disturbance has temporarily come to an end. Although cotton prices seem to be falling, they are still above the level of general prices in our country and the prices of various goods in various countries around the world. This is the main reason why cotton prices are weak and unstable. It is impossible to maintain the weak market price for a long time with temporary measures. Even if the fourth proposal of the Control Committee is strictly implemented, and the cotton of each factory is no longer delivered to the exchange, it will only promote one and suppress the other, and will become a tool for speculators to use. As a result, it is feared that industry, commerce, and the people will hardly benefit. Although the goal of control is to stabilize or raise prices, its implementation must first clarify the location of the disease. The current crisis of Chinese yarn factories is caused by the world's general trend and the domestic environment. However, Chinese factories themselves also have great weaknesses that need to be rescued and improved urgently. Let us describe the current situation as follows: It is found that there are 28 Chinese factories in Shanghai, with a total of more than 1,081,000 spindles. The number of cotton yarn currently in stock is about 70,000 pieces, not including the goods in the exchange. There are 30 foreign yarn factories, with a total of 1,285,000 spindles. The machinery is newer and more goods are shipped out, with no cotton yarn in stock. It is also found that the labor cost for Chinese factories to produce yarn, calculated at 20 counts, is 40 to 50 yuan per bale, including taxes. Japanese factories only need about 30 yuan. Although yarn sales have seemed to move slightly recently, because the resistance to Japanese goods has eased, Japanese yarn has also taken this opportunity to dump a large quantity of goods. The sales channels of Chinese yarn have been almost completely taken away. The reasons for this are nothing more than low prices and unscrupulous merchants seeking profit and promoting sales. The points of its superior quality are that the raw materials are pure, the machinery is new, the management is meticulous, and the products are uniform. The reason for its low price is that it uses reduced costs to suit the purchasing power of the Chinese people, vigorously implementing economic aggression in order to defeat our country's factories. The fittest survive, which is the rule of natural selection. Chinese factories are in this situation, struggling to compete with it, and how much can they be spared? Now that new cotton is on the market, the cotton price is around 40 yuan. If calculated on this basis, Chinese factories seem to be able to make a profit by producing yarn compared to the current yarn price. However, the sales channels of Chinese yarn have been affected by rural bankruptcy and oppressed by the dumping of Japanese yarn. It is still difficult for Chinese factories to sell their yarn, and the burden of accumulated interest is getting heavier and heavier. In the long run, how can this be remedied? The control plan must first conform to the national conditions. If we weigh the situation in which our country is located, the failure to implement tax protection policies, the presence of domestic and foreign factories, the government's financial constraints, and the disorganization of the financial organization, we must consider all of these when implementing the policy of stabilizing market prices. In short, the people's expectation is a fundamental remedy. In terms of its facilities, scholars at home and abroad have all seen the crux of the matter and have their own writings and detailed arguments, which need not be repeated. Our government has also set a general plan and started to implement it. However, because the overall action is time-consuming, we should first plan to treat the symptoms. We believe that the two points of foreign imports and competition between domestic and foreign factories are the most important to pay attention to. They should be properly regulated and incorporated into the corresponding commercial norms. As for the Chinese factories themselves, they must improve their technology, reduce labor costs, and catch up quickly. Even if they cannot immediately surpass others, they must be able to compete with them. They must also obtain the assistance of political forces to resolve their problems, so that yarn merchants will not be affected by unexpected shadows and can feel at ease in their business. Furthermore, they should actively reorganize the six plans, including agriculture, industry, education, and economic organization, in order to seek complete and fundamental relief. Is it in this?</p>
<h3>Request to Substantially Recall the Order</h3>
<p>The brokers request the exchange to forward a letter to the Ministry of Industry, requesting the recall of the order. The letter states: Respectfully, we previously received a letter stating that the exchange, upon receiving a telegram from the Ministry of Industry, immediately submitted it to the board of directors for discussion. Based on the business regulations, it was resolved that from this date until the end of December of this year, brokers delivering cotton yarn, with valid warehouse receipts and inspection certificates from this exchange, may still provide for delivery. However, the delivered cotton yarn must first obtain a permit from the Chinese Cotton Mill Owners Association and then submit the permit to this exchange; otherwise, this exchange will refuse to accept it, etc. This has been announced to all brokers for their information. Our association convened a general meeting of all members at that time, and all agreed that this was an unprecedented move and it would be very difficult to force customers to comply. Moreover, the brokers' business would lose its guarantee in the future. Therefore, a letter was sent requesting the Ministry of Industry to review the matter. However, no response has been received to date, causing deep anxiety. Stabilizing yarn prices to maintain the cotton industry is a temporary expedient, not a fundamental solution. To put it into practice, manufacturers should be provided with financial assistance or their inventory of yarn should be purchased so that Chinese factories do not have to sell at a loss. The stability of yarn prices cannot be achieved simply by the exchange refusing to accept new yarn. The exchange was originally established to regulate supply and demand and to equalize yarn prices. The prices within the exchange must always correspond to the actual supply and demand situation and cannot be manipulated by human power. Now, the Ministry of Industry's telegram orders the refusal to accept new yarn, which in effect allows the existing yarn in the exchange to be monopolized for speculation. Not only will the yarn prices in the exchange no longer represent the actual supply and demand, but also because new yarn cannot be delivered, its use will inevitably become narrower and the market price will fall further. Therefore, the result is nothing more than raising yarn prices in the exchange and benefiting futures buyers. Furthermore, according to Article 41 of the Exchange Law, the Ministry of Industry is a supervisory authority. If this exchange violates laws or regulations, or engages in activities that harm public interest or disrupt public safety, it may be subject to penalties such as suspension of business. However, the order to refuse to accept new yarn does not conform to the penalties listed in that article. Moreover, all brokers in this exchange conduct business by buying and selling on behalf of customers. At the time of the customers' entrustment, they all expected that the new yarn could be deposited for delivery at maturity. If the new yarn is refused and the old rules are suddenly changed, the position of gains and losses will be reversed, greatly deviating from the original expectations. It will be difficult to force customers to comply with the new rules based on the old contracts, which will damage the exchange's credibility, hinder the brokers' business, and have a significant impact. Your association, as the executive organ of this exchange, can legally file an administrative appeal to seek relief. Even if the administrative appeal does not achieve its purpose, a lawsuit can still be filed, leaving more room for maneuver. However, after receiving the Ministry's telegram, you immediately issued a temporary announcement stating that new yarn must first be approved by the Chinese Cotton Mill Owners Association before it can be delivered, and you used Article 169 of the business regulations to control the brokers, preventing them from raising objections. Your association's announcement, nominally following the Ministry's order, is actually suspected of using administrative penalties as a means of infringing rights. After the announcement, customers hesitate to come forward, and the brokers' business has completely stopped. Therefore, in order to protect our own business, we must once again seriously request your association to formally revoke the aforementioned announcement. At the same time, we hope that you will represent this exchange and file an administrative appeal to the Ministry of Industry within the prescribed time limit, requesting the recall of the order. In this way, the lost credibility can still be recovered, and the depressed business may improve. As for the announcement mentioned in Article 169 of the business regulations, it should be limited to matters necessary for business and not stipulated in the regulations. Now, refusing to accept new yarn is not necessary for business, and it is being used as a means of infringing rights. Therefore, in terms of logic, it should be interpreted that brokers are not prohibited from objecting to this announcement. If they suffer losses as a result, they may also claim compensation from the individuals who participated in the resolution. It is difficult to use that article to silence the public. This special letter is hereby issued for your information and implementation. We await your response with anticipation. To the Board of Directors of the Yarn and Cloth Exchange.</p>
<h3>Broker's Letter to the Exchange</h3>
<p>Respectfully, the effectiveness of the exchange's periodic yarn and cotton trading is specifically to regulate supply and demand and equalize market prices so that factories and merchants can hedge buy and hedge sell as a tool for practical business budgeting. Therefore, the price fluctuations of the exchange's periodic trading are always based on the actual production and sales situation and the supply and demand of both buyers and sellers as a standard, which cannot be manipulated by human power. Moreover, the stability of yarn prices cannot be achieved simply by the exchange refusing to accept new yarn. This time, the Ministry of Industry ordered the exchange to refuse to accept new yarn and not to provide for delivery, which is a temporary change to the delivery method for the November and December futures yarn, forcing both buyers and sellers to comply with the new rules based on the old contracts. Therefore, the business of our brokers and the transactions of our customers will all lose their guarantee. Our association has previously clarified the difficulties and sent a letter requesting your exchange to forward it to the Ministry of Industry, requesting consideration of the business situation and granting a review. Now, before the Ministry's reply, customers are hesitant to come forward, and our brokers' business has no basis, so they cannot continue to provide services as usual. Therefore, following a resolution of all members, the trading of new May futures yarn will be temporarily suspended, pending a guarantee before business can resume. This special letter is hereby submitted for your information. To the Board of Directors of the Shanghai Chinese Yarn and Cloth Exchange.</p>
<h3>The Cotton Mill Owners Association Hosts a Banquet for the Committees of the Cotton Industry Control Association. The Greatest Foundation of the National Economy is Built on the Cotton Industry. Overcoming the Current Difficulties Depends on Common Goals and Cooperation.</h3>
<p>On the evening of the 28th, the Chinese Cotton Mill Owners Association hosted a banquet at the Hua'an Restaurant for various representatives and standing committee members of the Cotton Industry Control Association. The banquet was presided over by Chairman Nie Lusheng. In addition to the entire delegation of the Cotton Mill Owners Association, Chen Guangfu, Zou Bingwen, Li Shengbo, Tang Xinghai, and others from the Cotton Industry Control Committee were present. Halfway through the dinner, Chairman Nie Lusheng delivered a speech, saying that Chairman Rong Zongjing of the association was unable to attend due to illness and had instructed him to represent the association in hosting this modest banquet to welcome the director and standing committee members of the Cotton Industry Control Association, the delegates attending from afar, and the new members of the association. A month ago, Mr. Song Ziwen of the National Government's Economic Committee returned from overseas and, in view of the trend of national control in the economic policies of various countries, decided to implement control over the cotton industry, which is the largest and most competitive in the country. As a result, the Cotton Industry Control Committee was organized and appointed people from the financial, political, and cotton industries as members. For a month, the colleagues have been working day and night to discuss major plans. The Shanghai colleagues, realizing that the government has this good intention for our industry, invited colleagues from all over the country to gather and discuss how to strengthen our organization so that we can accept the government's favor for our industry. This is the reason for convening this conference of members from afar in Shanghai. We are deeply gratified that Mr. Chen Guangfu, Chairman of the Cotton Industry Control Committee, has come to attend. Now, I would like to invite Mr. Chen to speak.</p>
<h3>Chen Guangfu's Speech</h3>
<p>Today, I am honored to be invited by you to participate in this grand banquet. Everyone present is either involved in the yarn industry or related to it. I would like to sincerely offer a few words for your consideration. Cotton is an essential item for clothing and bedding, and it has a significant relationship with agriculture, industry, and commerce.</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>England and Japan have established themselves on it, and its importance is evident. The greatest foundation of the national economy is built on the cotton industry. We have seen hundreds of political events in the world, and only economic issues remain. Nation-building cannot deviate from this principle. Therefore, the national economy of our country is directly related to the cotton industry. It has been more than forty years since the adoption of mechanical looms in the late Qing Dynasty. The number of yarn spindles has increased to more than five million, and Chinese merchants account for more than 56% of them. No other country can match our abundant raw materials, vast markets, and low labor costs. With such resources, we still suffer annual losses of more than 300 million yuan. In this time of economic recession, coupled with the inability to protect ourselves, the government is struggling to survive and adapt to the environment, so it established a control association under the National Economic Committee. This is a last resort, and we should reflect deeply on this and feel pain. At this point, we must review the mistakes of the past. The buying and selling in the market over the past forty years tells us that the entrepreneurial spirit is not inferior to others. However, there are those who have divergent ambitions, those who lack capital, those who prioritize personal convenience and neglect the concept of enterprise, those who excel in scientific knowledge but lack commercial operation, and those who are biased towards commercial operation but lack scientific knowledge. It is difficult to find someone who is proficient in both. It is difficult to find an organization that is both complete and rational. Although this is unavoidable in the course of evolution, we must know that our industry is by no means a single undertaking. Only by concentrating our strength and making overall plans can we seek the development of the entire industry and the survival of the whole. The Cotton Industry Control Committee stands between the government and the manufacturers, and the most important thing is the connection between capital, academics, and the business community. Its mission is to integrate and connect science and commerce, and to completely rationalize production, manufacturing, and sales, so as to lay the greatest foundation for the national economy. This has already been declared and announced to us by the National Economic Committee. My colleagues and I are committed to working with you to strive to achieve this goal. The Chinese Cotton Mill Owners Association is an organization for the permanent unity of the industry. The Cotton Industry Control Committee is willing to fully support it with utmost sincerity, to promote the realization of the government's plan and the development of the national economy. We deeply hope that you will be of one mind and one heart, pool your wisdom and efforts, strengthen the organization, and promote its power, so as to seek the overall development of the industry and avert the crisis. The country and society will benefit from it. This is my sincere wish.</p>
<h3>Nie Lusheng's Speech</h3>
<p>Mr. Chen's sincere speech and the announcement of the Cotton Industry Control Association's major plan have inspired us. On behalf of the industry, I would like to express my gratitude. The difficulties of China today are of course affected by the global economic recession. In the past twenty years, Chinese politics has changed from monarchy to democracy. At the same time, the tide of economic revolution in Europe and America has also shifted from the West to the East. There is a country in the East that is more organized and has not experienced revolution. The entire people, from top to bottom, are of one mind and follow the trend and apply it. In forty or fifty years, not only has the country been built up, but it has also expanded its territory. Our country, on the other hand, is proud of its lack of organization and has suffered the impact of this trend, resulting in today's outcome. Not only is our industry almost unable to stand, but all industries are almost the same. In this crisis, there is no other way but for the government and the people to cooperate. In the past twenty years, the government has not paid attention to the people's livelihood and industries. Recently, there has been a proposal for a National Economic Committee and the organization of a Cotton Industry Control Association. The future results cannot be predicted, but in short, the government's sincerity in guiding the people to build the country has started from this. The past problem was disunity and lack of cooperation. The affairs of the country are like this, the affairs of the industry are like this, and the pain of our industry is based on this. If our industry cannot unite as one and the Cotton Mill Owners Association cannot stand in a strong position, no matter whether the Cotton Industry Control Association has funds or plans, it will not benefit our industry. Only those who help themselves will be helped by others. I believe that this conference is an opportunity for the rebirth of our industry. I hope that our colleagues will study it in detail, take the industry as the prerequisite, abandon individualism, and make this association sound. Do not think that the Cotton Industry Control Association can obtain some funds from the government and revitalize the cotton industry. Do not think that the members of the Cotton Industry Control Association are immortals. The two colleagues in the association would have been able to develop their own factories long ago. Therefore, the future of the cotton industry still depends on the joint efforts of the industry. In the past, a king who was about to die summoned his fifteen sons and ordered each of them to break an arrow. They were all able to break it. Then he tied fifteen arrows together and broke them, but they could not be broken. He warned them, "Only by working together can you survive." Our industry is facing difficulties, and it depends on the ability of our colleagues to work together. If so, even if we cannot surpass others in ten years, we will definitely be able to deal with others and avoid destruction. England is the largest cotton industry country in the world. Recently, a buyer from a British textile machinery company came to me to inquire about the future of Lancashire cotton mills. The British are accustomed to being very proud, but they actually said something unexpected. He said that the British textile industry, except for the 2 million spindles that use Egyptian cotton for fine spinning, has no hope. England has been the leader of the world's cotton industry for a hundred years. Its cotton goods have spread all over the world. England has always been proud of its commerce and has the financial resources, talent, and military power to protect it. It did not expect to be defeated by Japan in these twenty years. Even though it has specially increased the import tax on cotton goods in its territories from 50% to 75%, it is still ineffective. The reason is not just one. The Japanese's ability to endure hardship is the greatest. To put it simply, an English factory worker manages eight machines, which is already difficult, while a Japanese worker manages forty or fifty machines. The manager of an English factory does not work on Fridays, while the manager of Toyota, the best Japanese factory in Shanghai, Mr. Nishikawa, goes to the factory every day and inspects the machines twice in the morning and afternoon in detail. If there are any shortcomings, he patiently guides them. Therefore, from the technicians to the workers, they all respect him. The spirit of the leader is like this, and those under him dare not be negligent. Japanese factories have fewer labor disputes and more capital, which is the way to victory. The fact that their employees must meet the standards of academic qualifications, age, and ability to endure hardship is the reason for their success. Looking back at our country, we only use human relations and seeking personal gain as a means of promotion. Those in charge know nothing. Although the workers are ignorant, they can still install machines. How can they respect those in charge? England, as the leader in the cotton industry, has failed. Chinese factories in the country, as the owners, are not thriving. The Japanese have taken the place of England and have made great progress in China. Success, failure, victory, and greed are all part of it. Therefore, if the leader cannot be a role model for the entire factory, the future prosperity and decline can be predicted. I would like to summarize two points for you. Each factory should strive to improve internally, and each factory should work together externally. These are difficult times, and the time will not come again. The survival of the country rests on our shoulders. Mr. Rong Zongjing was unable to attend due to illness and instructed me to report on two matters on his behalf. First, I have been honored to be the chairman of this association for ten years, and I am ashamed that I have not contributed more to the industry. What I am most distressed about is that the yarn tax has increased from two taels per bale to eight yuan five jiao eight fen and eleven yuan five jiao eight fen, and the import duty on foreign cotton has increased from eight qian per dan to four yuan. Our country's situation is that yarn sales are lagging and raw materials are lacking. The individual has the most spindles and machines, and the burden is huge. The pain of the industry can be imagined. Second, in recent years, I have not been able to make much progress, but I have never wasted a penny on inappropriate uses, and I have not wasted the membership fees you have paid.</p>

At that time, the province of Massachusetts ordered all people in the province to take a holiday to commemorate the founding of the country and thank God for his blessings. Today, it has become a national trend and has been promoted to the whole country, and even to American nationals all over the world.</p>
<h3>Nanjing Road, Citizens' Association Advocates Thrift Movement</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Nanjing Businessmen's United Association, along with the First Special District Citizen's First District Branch, yesterday issued a proposal on thrift, addressed to various institutions and organizations. The original text stated, "In recent years, countries around the world have shown signs of economic recession. Even the wealthy people of the United States have suffered widespread unemployment and considerable hardship, and the government is seeking ways to provide relief. China's economy has already declined to its lowest point. Since the success of the revolution and the rule of the National Revolutionary Army, internal strife has not yet been quelled, and external troubles have come one after another, leading to the economic destitution of rural areas in various places. The majority of the population lacks purchasing power, and industry and commerce are declining daily. Those with relatively more assets and slight savings are again concentrating their wealth in the silver and money industries. However, the silver and money industries, affected by the current situation, rarely extend loans to ordinary people. When emergencies occur, the right to use funds cannot be exercised by depositors. Therefore, the financial sector has reduced opportunities for circulation, and the social economy is declining day by day. In particular, the unprecedented invasion by the Japanese on January 28, 1932, dealt an even heavier blow to the country. This is not only true for Tianjin, Shanghai, and Wuhan, but also for places like Guangdong, where overseas Chinese are forced to return home without means of livelihood, and the economy also shows signs of decline. Shanghai, as the central hub for trade between China and foreign countries, has been at the forefront of the war against Japan, and therefore the impact is the greatest. The market is sluggish, and the state of industrial and commercial depression and financial stagnation is unprecedented in recent years. If we want to save ourselves from this misfortune, we must make every effort to be thrifty and emulate the ancients in 'building up the people and educating them,' hoping for revival in twenty or thirty years. Now, let us try to discuss the aspects of thrift as follows: (A) Those related to self-determination: 1. Advocate a frugal lifestyle. Each individual should strive to save on clothing and food, and shops and other affiliated members should especially save on expenses. Promoting thrift will influence the entire society to act collectively. For example, shops that operate night markets can greatly advance their closing hours and advance their opening hours to save on uneconomical electricity expenses and reverse the decadent trend of late rising in the city. Practice frugality. 2. Resolutely use domestic goods. If the people use one more share of domestic products, they will leak one less share to those who hate us. It is appropriate to sever economic ties with them, and other imported goods should be avoided unless absolutely necessary. 3. Increase efficiency. Working personnel, in this national crisis, whether for public or private matters, should be patient, hardworking, and diligent, increase efficiency, promote production, and jointly seek business development. 4. Save on various expenses. Strive to save on expenses. For families, this can lighten the burden, and for shops, it can reduce costs. In addition to major expenses such as rent, other expenses such as food, advertising, etc., should be saved. (B) Those related to external forces: 1. Demand lower rents. Rents in Shanghai are increasing daily. For middle-class families, rent takes up more than half of their monthly income. The heaviest expense for shops is the rent. Shops with poor business often do not earn enough in monthly revenue to cover their monthly rent. This is very common. However, landlords only know how to raise prices and profit, regardless of market conditions. The Public Works Department also often engages in forcibly increasing prices in order to increase property taxes. In reality, leased shops either close down due to being unable to bear the huge rent or dare not rent to open a business, resulting in more empty houses and a colder market. The revenue of landlords and the Public Works Department is decreasing, which is not the right path for economic researchers. Therefore, it is necessary to seek rent reductions from landlords and request that the Public Works Department collect taxes based on the actual price to reduce the burden on merchants and assist in the recovery of the market. If the Public Works Department can change its tax collection method and also levy a small tax on empty houses from landlords, it can both curb high rents and increase the Public Works Department's property tax revenue, which is a win-win situation. 2. Limit the prices of public utilities. Public utilities such as telephones, electricity, heating, lighting, tap water, public buses, etc., were originally established to facilitate the public and prosper society, and are different from ordinary profit-seeking businesses. Therefore, all operators of public utilities should take extremely low prices to seek universality and benefit the citizens. However, the authorities of the Shanghai International Settlement do not take the protection of taxpayers' interests as the principle. For example, for tap water, they agreed to the water company's amendment of the contract, allowing price increases. For electricity, they allowed price increases based on coal prices but did not order price reductions when coal prices fell. Furthermore, last year, the Shanghai Telephone Company retroactively increased prices, and the Public Works Department also shielded and approved it. Telephone users reluctantly paid under protest, but the case is still pending. The telephone company, taking advantage of this weakness, has recently proposed another price increase. These are all actions that violate the current social and economic conditions and are, in fact, unbearable for the entire citizenry. In order to seek recovery through thrift, it is especially important to unite efforts to limit the arbitrary price increases of public utilities, so that it is in line with principles and can drive the recovery of the national economy. The above points are the main points, and the demand for rent reduction is especially important. Moreover, the business of landlords is stable, and although reducing rent by a certain amount can still cover expenses. If they can follow the precedent of places like Hong Kong and reduce rents during times of economic depression and then collect the original price after recovery, it is also the way to common prosperity and co-existence. Otherwise, everyone will perish together. These are merely rough ideas. It is hoped that everyone will provide guidance and jointly strive for the early realization of the goal of market recovery, which will not only be the good fortune of our business community, but also benefit the country and society."</p>
<h3>Yesterday Evening, the Newspaper Association Gave a Farewell Dinner for Reuters Correspondent Cox, Who Will Go to Japan on the 3rd of Next Month</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Cox, the manager of the Far East News Department of Reuters, has been transferred to Japan as a correspondent and is scheduled to leave Shanghai for Tokyo on the 3rd of next month. The Shanghai Newspaper Association, recognizing Cox's 22 years in China and his harmonious relationship with the press, specially hosted a farewell dinner at Xinghualou at 7 p.m. last night. Guests included Cox and his daughter, Reuters Far East General Manager Zhang Shile, Central News Agency President Xiao Tongzi, Ford, Zhang Sixu, Xie Fusheng, Jia Xiyan. Hosts included Wang Boqi, Zhang Zhuping, Ma Yinliang, Qian Bohan, Xiong Shaohao, Wang Weizhen, Qian Cangshuo, Gu Angruo, Qian Hua, and He Xiya. During the dinner, Chairman Wang Boqi delivered a speech, Cox replied, and Zhang Shile also delivered a speech. The gathering ended happily at 10 p.m. The Chairman's speech and Cox's reply are recorded below.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech: Mr. Shi Liangcai was unable to attend today due to other commitments. I, on behalf of the Shanghai Newspaper Association, express our admiration for Mr. Cox, a prominent figure in the Eastern press, at this farewell gathering. Mr. Cox has been with Reuters for 33 years, and two-thirds of that time has been spent working in China. Now he will be transferred to Japan. On the Japanese side, it is certainly a celebration of getting a talented person. On the Chinese side, although his successor is also a person of well-known talent, it cannot but be said to be a loss. Mr. Cox, as the news director of Reuters, in charge of receiving and sending news, has always been extremely fair in matters concerning China, and has been able to do his best to ensure that Chinese affairs are not misunderstood at difficult and important times. Moreover, Mr. Cox has never had the intention of exaggeration or boasting. Therefore, Chinese friends have always admired Mr. Cox. After taking up his new position, he should still be able to uphold his consistent spirit and continue to work hard. We now wish Mr. Cox good health, success in all things, and strive for the construction of Reuters. We also hope that Mr. Cox will return to Shanghai in the shortest possible time so that we can reminisce at any time. Now, please everyone raise your glasses to wish Mr. Cox a bon voyage. Furthermore, Mr. Zhang Shile has just returned to Shanghai from England. I would also like to take this opportunity to welcome all of you.</p>
<p>Cox's Reply: I am deeply honored to be invited here tonight. I am deeply grateful for the praise for my slight efforts to bring China closer to other countries. I will certainly work even harder in the future to live up to expectations. I recall the past vividly. I traveled to India for five years and then came to Shanghai. It was a bitterly cold winter day, just a week after Dr. Sun Yat-sen established the government. I personally witnessed the birth of Indian nationalism, so I am even more interested in China's progress. After arriving in China, the work was quite arduous. I not only reorganized and improved the receiving and sending of foreign news but also, with the help of Mr. Su and Mr. Miller, organized and established the local news distribution. I firmly believe that the success of local news distribution depends on the cooperation of the press. When Reuters started distributing news in Shanghai in the autumn of 1912, it immediately gained subscriptions from eighteen Chinese newspapers. This should be pursued today. The reason why the news distributed by Reuters in the Far East is called Reuters Pacific News is that it is necessary to enhance the friendship and understanding between the countries along the Pacific Rim. The Republic of China is striving to build and progress through difficult struggles and has made considerable progress. I greatly admire the success of the Chinese press in building Chinese public opinion. I wish the Chinese press a bright future and the Chinese nation a prosperous future.</p>
<h3>Chen Jiageng Rubber Company Closes Down Branches Across the Country, the Shanghai Branch Rushed to Close Yesterday, Assets and Inventory Inspected by HSBC Bank</h3>
<p>According to Dagong News, the Chen Jiageng Rubber Products Company in Singapore, due to sluggish business and heavy export taxes, has decided to close all of its twenty-odd branches across the country.

<h3>Chairman of the Yellow River Flood Relief Committee, Kong Xiangxi, Concerned about the Child Victims, Allocates an Additional 150,000 Yuan for Making Children's Clothing, etc.</h3>
<p>The Disaster Relief Group of the Yellow River Flood Relief Committee has been issuing a large number of relief tickets and urgent relief tickets for use in various disaster areas. Especially with the sudden cold weather, provinces are rushing to issue urgent relief tickets. Therefore, 80,000 urgent relief tickets were sent to Shandong, 60,000 to Henan, and 30,000 to Hebei. As for the porridge distribution certificates required by the porridge kitchens in various places, 10,000 each were also issued to Shandong and Henan. However, the disaster areas in Changyuan, Dongming, and Puyang counties in Hebei Province, based on local conditions, will not set up porridge kitchens but will focus on issuing urgent relief tickets to ensure widespread coverage. Furthermore, Kong Yongzhi, the chairman of the committee, considered that the 100,000 sets of cotton clothing previously made by the committee were insufficient to distribute to the disaster victims in the three provinces. Moreover, these 100,000 sets of cotton clothing are all adult clothing, and there is still a lack of cold-weather clothing for the child victims. Therefore, he allocated an additional 150,000 yuan to make additional cotton clothing and children's cotton clothing for universal distribution, and to purchase more relief tickets to distribute winter relief.</p>

<h3>Connecting the Qiantang River, the Railway Tunnel Awaits Decision from the Ministry of Railways, the Cao'e River Bridge and the Xicao Section of the Railway, Both Railway Bureaus Have Drafted Plans for Construction</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway is still nominally connected but actually disconnected. The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Construction and the Hangzhou Municipal Government and the Ministry of Railways, in order to complete the entire line, have drafted plans to build the Qiantang River Railway Bridge and an underwater tunnel, and at the same time to build the railway between Xixing and Cao'e and complete the Cao'e River Bridge. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Connecting the Qiantang River</h3>
<p>Hangzhou City, as the provincial capital of Zhejiang, is the terminal of the Grand Canal, with a large population and developed commerce. However, the Qiantang River runs across central Zhejiang, and transportation is disconnected. Although successive authorities have occasionally proposed building a railway bridge, it was suspended due to financial constraints and construction difficulties. Last year, the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Construction had an organization for the Special Design Committee for the Qianjiang Railway Bridge, and the Water Conservancy Bureau planned the bridge foundation in the vicinity of the Liuhe Pagoda and carried out drilling. The Hangzhou Municipal Government, on the other hand, considered that building a sub-bottom tunnel may be superior to a railway bridge in terms of funding, transportation, shipping location, construction materials, maintenance, and safety. Therefore, Yang Jian, a technician of the government, referring to the completed tunnel projects in Europe and the United States, drafted a plan for the Qianjiang sub-bottom tunnel for reference and adoption. After the plan was completed, it was sent to the Ministry of Railways along with the previous plan for review. The Ministry of Railways considered that the city government's plan for the Qianjiang sub-bottom tunnel was quite detailed. However, since trains, trams, and automobiles are all planned to pass through the same location, special attention should be paid to ventilation, drainage, and security equipment. The cross-section of the tunnel, with regard to the railway part, should comply with the provisions of the Ministry's issued clearance diagram. The tram and automobile parts should also be pre-specified. Moreover, the sub-bottom tunnel project is unprecedented in China, and it is difficult to find skilled craftsmen, so construction will not be without difficulties. Therefore, various expenses will inevitably increase. As for comparing the tunnel and the railway bridge, it is necessary to conduct detailed research and investigation to determine which is more appropriate and beneficial, and to drill in multiple places to clearly understand the geology and accurately know the construction plan and design estimate before a decision can be made on whether to adopt it. Furthermore, in terms of the tunnel itself, there is also a possibility and necessity to research and compare sub-bottom tunnels and underwater tunnels. The government has already ordered a detailed study and reply yesterday for review.</p>
<h3>Completing the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway still has a section between Zha Kou and Cao'e that has not been built. Although the bridge foundation of the Cao'e River Bridge has been completed, it was suspended due to the outbreak of the European War. The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureaus drafted a plan to complete the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway, which included 31 kilometers from the Cao'e River to Shaoxing and 47 kilometers from Shaoxing to Xixing. However, it was suspended due to financial constraints. Now, connecting the Qiantang River is actively underway, so the two bureaus are also actively proceeding with the Cao'e River Bridge and the railway project from Xixing to Cao'e in order to complete it as soon as possible, develop the business of the two railways, and benefit transportation. Before construction, in order to facilitate passengers, a joint transportation service has been arranged with the Xiaoshao Long-Distance Bus Company.</p>

<h3>Banquet for de Gopeira (Photo by Xu Tianzhang)</h3>

<h3>At the Welcome Reception</h3>
<p>The reception was held in the library on the second floor of the French Association. As there were not many seats, everyone stood around the room. First, Lirong, the president of the French Association, delivered an introduction, which was translated by Secretary Lin Jun, introducing Mr. de and reporting on the significance of the gathering. Then, Mr. de gave a speech, translated by Feng Zhizhong, which roughly stated: "I am very honored to meet with comrades from the Chinese literary and press circles today. However, I am afraid that it is inconvenient for you to stand, so my speech will be quite short. I am very grateful for the welcome from the Chinese intellectual community during this visit to China. I hope to have opportunities to exchange ideas frequently in the future. Just now, a Chinese journalist asked me about 'my impressions of China.' I have only been in China for seven and a half days, and everything is like a newborn child, still learning. However, the most noticeable things after coming to China are: (1) Chinese cuisine is very good, and (2) Chinese women are very beautiful. The most comfortable food in the world is Chinese and French cuisine."</p>
<h3>Humorous Conversation</h3>
<p>After Mr. de finished speaking, he had a very humorous conversation with the reporters. Here is a record: (Question) What are your thoughts on Japan's invasion of China? (Mr. de's answer) This question is too serious and cannot be discussed by a novelist. (Question) What books have you published recently? (Answer) There are two books, one is "The Woman in Red Rouge" and the other is "The Ideal Prison with India as its Background." (Question) Have you issued any written opinions since coming to China? (Answer) This visit to China is entirely in the capacity of a novelist, to publish some literary works and travelogues. I do not consult on other matters, but I am very willing to observe politics with fairness. (Question) Will you go to the Northeast Three Provinces? (Answer) No. (Question) What is the main purpose of your literary works? (Answer) The purpose of writing is only to hope that a book, after it is published, can make readers like it, and I would be satisfied if they do not discard it after reading it once. (Question) Did your wife come with you? (Answer) She did not come, because I do not have a wife yet. (Question) It is heard that you advocate celibacy. Is that true? (Answer) I plan to remain celibate for forty or fifty years. My son is my book. (Question) Will you get married in the future? (Answer) Maybe one day in the future I will see a very beautiful Chinese woman and change my mind and marry a Chinese woman. (Question) What are your thoughts on Soviet Russian literature? (Answer) (1) I am not familiar with Soviet Russian literature. (2) I do not approve of communism. (3) I have not seen much new Soviet Russian literature. (Question) What are your thoughts on Chinese literature? (Answer) I have not studied it. I will start studying it after arriving in Peiping. (Question) What are your hobbies? (Answer) I like sports, such as swimming and swordsmanship. In addition, I like to study human thought. (Question) Do you think smoking has any benefits? (Answer) Smoking can make people meditate and forget about the things in the world. In this chaotic world, it feels better to forget about it. At this point, the guests took their leave and dispersed.</p>
<h3>Left Shanghai Last Night</h3>
<p>Mr. de left Shanghai by express train last night for Beijing. After staying in Beijing for a few days, he will travel to Peiping for about a month, then return to Shanghai via Japan, and plans to visit the interior such as Hankou, Hong Kong, Guangdong, and Yunnan.</p>
<h3>Alas, Chinese Modern Women, Mirror Shoes Imported by the Box, Money Rolling Eastward, Misleadingly Praised by the Daily News</h3>
<p>According to the Japanese-language Shanghai Daily News yesterday, among the imports from Japan recently, the most prominent are sundries, and among sundries, mirrors are especially numerous. Every time a ship arrives, there are always thirty or forty boxes, or even more than fifty boxes. The total number of cargo ships arriving this month is more than three hundred boxes. Each box contains twelve dozen, which is about 40,000 mirrors. Leather shoes, which Chinese people love to wear, are also not a small number for women. Each ship has as many as sixty boxes, and there are up to four hundred boxes, each containing two hundred pairs. Since mid-autumn, the demand for general consumer goods has been very strong. This is also a good sign of the economic surplus of middle-class Chinese families. The purchasing power of Chinese women is increasing, so the atmosphere on the streets has recently become lively.</p>
<h3>Kerosene Prices to Rise, Gasoline Prices Remain Unchanged</h3>
<p>According to the Continental Press, the three major companies operating the Far East oil industry announced yesterday (the 28th) that the price of kerosene, ten gallons per box, will increase significantly from November 29th. However, gasoline will still be sold at the price of seven jiao per gallon, which has been the price for the past few weeks. The price of kerosene from Mobil Oil was 5.2 yuan per box yesterday and will rise to 6.4 yuan today. Texaco and Yubian Company will also sell at this price. Before this, these two companies charged 5.7 yuan per box last week, and before that, all companies sold it for 5.2 yuan. An employee of a certain kerosene company stated last night that the price increase of gasoline and kerosene has nothing to do with each other. Although we especially hope that the price of gasoline will also rise, the companies have not yet reached an agreement on this matter.</p>
<h3>A Poor Woman's Encounter with Deception: Male and Female Abductors Separate Mother and Children; Police Authorities Should Swiftly Rescue Them</h3>
<p>Zhou Ruisong, a villager from Zhou Dongjia Village in Wuxi, is fifty years old. His wife, Shi, is thirty-nine years old, and they have a son and a daughter. The son, named Xiting, is sixteen years old but short, resembling an eight-year-old. The daughter, named Fengzhen, is eleven years old. Recently, Zhou's wife, Shi, due to poor harvests and financial difficulties, on the afternoon of the eighth day of the seventh month of the lunar calendar this year, took Xiting and Fengzhen and boarded a small river steamer to Shanghai, intending to work as a domestic helper. The next day, around eleven o'clock in the morning, the steamer arrived in Shanghai and docked by the old Zhabei Bridge on the Suzhou Creek. The mother and children disembarked one after another, standing by the bridge pier to rest. They planned to find a matchmaking agency for lodging and to seek employment. At that moment, Wang Hanwen from Chongming passed by and noticed the three of them looking around, recognizing them as fellow villagers. Seeing Shi's still attractive appearance, he harbored evil intentions. He immediately approached them, pretending to be helpful. Shi, being new to Shanghai and unaware of the treacherous nature of the people there, saw Wang's gentle demeanor and told him the truth. Wang falsely claimed to run a domestic worker agency in the Nanshi area and offered to help her find employment. Shi believed him and followed him south. They stayed overnight in a small inn near the old Ximen. The next day, Wang led the three of them to the Xiangji paper shop outside Xiaonanmen in Gao Xiangtou for lunch. Wang then secretly spoke with Zhou Huangshi, an old woman from Ningbo, for a long time. Zhou Huangshi then told Shi that there was a family in Ningbo who could provide them with food and lodging, and would pay her two yuan a month. She claimed to be acquainted with them and offered to introduce her. Shi was delighted and agreed. The old woman and others then abducted the mother and children to Changsheng Bridge in Ningbo, selling Shi to a local villager, Zhou Liansheng, as his concubine. The old woman took all forty yuan of the sale price. By the time Shi realized she had fallen into the hands of bandits, she was trapped and unable to escape. Zhou Liansheng was of a violent nature and immediately ordered Xiting to call him "Dad." When Xiting refused, he was beaten. Shi, unable to bear the sight, took advantage of an opportunity to escape from Zhou's house with her children and sought refuge in the local defense corps, requesting assistance. However, Zhou Liansheng learned of this and went to the defense corps, offering six yuan to influence the members. He managed to take Shi and her children back home, beat them severely, and threatened them to prevent them from escaping. Shi, at this point, realized she had no relatives and was unfamiliar with the area, with no one to turn to. She could only remain in Zhou's house and endure the humiliation. However, her son, Xiting, although young, was very intelligent. Seeing his mother and sister living in such conditions, he knew it could not last. He decided to return home and ask his father to negotiate with Zhou to rescue his mother and sister. On the twentieth of this month, he seized an opportunity to escape from Zhou Liansheng's watch and walked to the pier, stowing away on the Hongxing steamer to Shanghai. On the steamer, he cried loudly because he had no money for a ticket. A staff member on the steamer noticed him and, after learning of his situation, was deeply moved and allowed him to travel without a ticket, providing him with food and lodging along the way. On the twenty-third, the ship arrived in Shanghai. The staff member gave him six jiao and personally escorted him to the North Railway Station. Xiting then used the six jiao to buy a train ticket and traveled alone back to his hometown on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway. He tearfully told his father, Zhou Ruisong, the details of what had happened. Upon hearing this news, the father was both shocked and overjoyed. Yesterday, he brought Xiting back to Shanghai, seeking the abductor Wang Hanwen without success. By chance, they passed the South Pier and suddenly saw Zhou Huangshi walking towards them. Xiting immediately pointed to his father and said, "This is the old woman who abducted us!" Zhou immediately grabbed her and handed her over to Han Baoqing, a guard from the Fourth Post there, who took her to the First District, First Precinct. After a preliminary interrogation by the Yi precinct chief, police were immediately dispatched to Gao Xiangtou to arrest the abductor Wang Hanwen. However, Wang had already fled, so he was not apprehended. It was ordered that a document be prepared to send Zhou Huangshi to the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation. Subsequently, funds would be allocated to go to Ningbo to rescue Zhou Shi and her children.</p>
<h3>Five Provinces and Cities Transportation Committee: Unifying Highway Vehicle Driving Regulations, Stipulating Driver Examination Rules and License Measures</h3>

<p>After a preliminary interrogation by the Yi precinct chief, police were immediately dispatched to Gao Xiangtou to arrest the abductor Wang Hanwen. However, Wang had already fled, so he was not apprehended. It was ordered that a document be prepared to send Zhou Huangshi to the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation. Subsequently, funds would be allocated to go to Ningbo to rescue Zhou Shi and her children, it is said.</p>
<h3>A Bizarre Marital Dispute: The Bride is Still a Virgin; The Wedding Invitations are Brand New</h3>
<p>Yang Didi, a 22-year-old woman from Haimen who works at the Yufeng Cotton Mill on Dinghai Road in Yangshupu, was on her way from the factory dormitory to work at around 6:00 AM yesterday morning when she was accosted by Ni Haisheng, a 52-year-old fellow townsman residing in Fahua Village, Jing'an Temple Road, along with his eldest son, Qingfu, 28, and second son, Jifu, 21. They had hired car number 18487 from Xiang Sheng Company and were waiting for her. They dragged Yang into the car and ordered it to drive to their home in Fahua. The woman cried and shouted for help. Wang Ayuan, the driver, realizing the situation was not good, drove the car to the General Patrol Station. The patrol chief, upon learning that the incident was a marital dispute and a case of abduction, due to jurisdictional issues, sent the three to the Yangshupu Patrol Station for investigation. According to Ni Haisheng, Yang was the wife of his second son, Jifu. In the tenth year of the Republic [1921], her father had arranged the marriage and there was a marriage contract to prove it. They were married in their hometown on January 12th of this year. In May, the woman secretly ran away, possibly having been abducted or sold, and there was no news of her. They now discovered that she was working as a factory worker, so they hired a car to take her home. When questioned, Yang completely denied being a member of the Ni family or having been married, claiming that she was still a virgin. If they did not believe her, they could have her examined. The patrol chief, seeing that both sides had conflicting accounts, sent Yang to Shengxin Hospital for examination by a doctor. It was confirmed that she was indeed a virgin. The patrol chief also sent a detective with Ni Qingfu to their home at No. 653 in Fahua Village. With the help of relatives, they found two marriage contracts from that time, a letter, and a funeral record from when Ni Haisheng's father passed away that mentioned the name "Grandson's Wife Yang." They brought these back to the patrol station. Yesterday morning, Ni Haisheng and his two sons were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District. Zhang Tianyin, the patrol station's lawyer, detailed the events and stated that the case was bizarre. The defendants had presented three types of counter-evidence. First, the marriage contract, which was over ten years old, should have been faded, but it was unusually bright, as if it had just been written. Second, a letter written by the woman's mother, Yang Wangshi, to Ni Haisheng, saying that she wished to cancel the marriage and would give him 60 yuan. Third, the funeral record of Ni Haisheng's father had the name "Yang" written on it. It was unclear whether this referred to Yang. The most compelling point was that, according to Ni Haisheng, Yang had been married to his son Jifu from January to May, and Yang had disappeared for quite some time. How could she still be a virgin? He presented all the evidence and the doctor's examination report for consideration. He also stated that the woman's mother, Yang Wangshi, had consistently denied that her daughter Cuidi was engaged to Ni Jifu, claiming that it was just casual talk about matchmaking when she was young. In July of this year, Ni Haisheng sent gifts four times, but they were all rejected. Later, the thatched hut where the Haimen woman and her daughter lived was suddenly set on fire. It was suspected that the defendants were responsible, but there was no concrete evidence. Therefore, the mother and daughter came to Shanghai to work in a cotton mill to make a living. When questioned, Ni Haisheng stated that the matchmaker was his brother, who had agreed to the marriage with the woman's father. At the time of the engagement, the betrothal gift was 40 yuan, but there were no jewelry. The marriage contract was written by Mr. Xu Wenxian, a teacher from the same village, who could still be found. Because both families were poor, they only used a small cart to bring the bride home and had a simple wedding feast with his son Jifu. When questioned, his two sons gave consistent accounts. At this point, it was already past noon. The patrol station's lawyer requested an extension for further investigation. Judge Wu Zehan ordered them to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the hearing.</p>
<h3>Preparations for the Third National Physicians' Congress</h3>
<p>The Third National Physicians' Congress of the National Physicians' Association is scheduled to be held from January 1st to 3rd next year at the Nanjing YMCA on Zhonghua Road, Nanjing.

<h3>Hangzhou-Huizhou Highway: Convenient Transportation After Opening; Beautiful Scenery Along the Way</h3>
<p>The Hangzhou-Huizhou Highway held its opening ceremony on the 26th. Lu Danlin, editor-in-chief of the Shanghai Road Association, was specially sent to participate and inspect the condition of the entire road. He returned to Shanghai yesterday. According to him, the road runs from Hangzhou to Huizhou, with a total length of 215 kilometers (equivalent to 374 li in Chinese miles). The entire road project was extremely large, especially the section from Yuling Pass to Xiahang, which is surrounded by towering mountains, steep peaks, and winding ridges. The route passes through places such as Laozhu Ridge, Mopan Mountain, Yushu Ridge, Zhongling, Huangtuo Ridge, and Xiakeng, all of which follow mountain streams. The route is as winding as a bow or the Chinese characters "亚" or "乃". The difficulty of construction can be imagined. The total construction cost (excluding the section from Hangzhou to Changhua, which was completed earlier) was over 730,000 yuan. Traffic signs along the way, divided into warning, directional, and prohibitory types, are installed completely to benefit travelers. From Hangzhou to Huizhou, the waterway used to take five to ten days. From Huizhou to Hangzhou, it took three days downstream. Now that the highway is open, it only takes eight hours to reach directly. For example, from Shanghai to Huizhou, you can arrive in the evening after departing in the morning, which is extremely convenient. Passing through places such as Linglong Mountain in Lin'an, East Tianmu Mountain, West Tianmu Mountain in Yuqian, and Taiping Bridge, Taibai Restaurant, Ruyi Temple, Wenzheng Mountain, and Ziyang Mountain in Huizhou, all are famous scenic spots. The scenery of Huangshan Mountain in Shexian is famous throughout the country. In the future, tourists will find it more convenient than before.</p>
<h3>The Women's Promote National Products Conference Resolves to Hold a Social Gathering on New Year's Day</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Women's Promote National Products Association held a temporary executive and supervisory committee meeting at Lake Society on Guizhou Road the day before yesterday (the 28th). Attendees included Ying Yining, Shu Huizhen, Tang Guanyu, Chen Jingrong, Lin Kecong, Cai Zhoujun, Chen Hongru, Zheng Ranghui, and a dozen others. Cai Zhoujun chaired the meeting, and Chen Jingrong served as the recorder. After the rituals were performed, the discussion began: (1) What kind of meaningful toys should be purchased to award to kindergarten students in Shanghai to inspire patriotic ideas? It was decided to order several dozen airplanes from the China Educational Toy Factory and submit them to the Shanghai Bureau of Education for distribution to the schools, so that students would all know the importance of promoting national products and saving the country through aviation. (2) It was proposed to hold a members' social gathering on New Year's Day next year to promote mutual fellowship. At that time, it was proposed to solicit members and welcome guests. The resolution was passed, and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>National Products Association Cables a Request to Strictly Prohibit the Export of Seashells to Maintain Raw Materials for National Buttons</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Citizens' Promote National Products Association believes that merchants producing seashells in various regions are greedy and unscrupulous, manipulating and controlling prices, supplying all seashells to Japanese merchants, secretly exporting them overseas, and cutting off the procurement of national button factories, leading to a lack of raw materials and factory shutdowns. The emotions of 100,000 workers across the country are panicked. Not only are interests being lost, and tariffs undercollected, but it also affects national production and social stability, which is no small matter. It was resolved at the second meeting of the fourteenth standing committee to send telegrams to the governors of Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Zhejiang provinces, ordering them to take action to strictly prohibit exports and advocate for national product factories. The original telegram is extracted below: (Address omitted) It is stated in a letter from the Maoli Button Factory Co., Ltd., a member of several associations, that the member was established three years ago with the aim of revitalizing industry and recovering interests. The products manufactured are superior to foreign goods and have won the trust of people across the country. The required raw materials, seashells, have always been purchased from various regions under the jurisdiction of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Zhejiang provinces. Recently, unscrupulous merchants in various regions have been enticed by Japanese merchants, manipulating and controlling prices, selling all seashells to Japanese merchants, secretly exporting them overseas, causing national product factories to have no goods to process, resulting in a trend of raw material shortages, production shutdowns, and factory closures. The public is panicking. They request that the association find ways to provide relief, and eliminate oppression. This is not only the member's hope, but also the livelihood of 100,000 workers in our industry, etc. It is found that seashells are necessary raw materials for manufacturing buttons, especially unique products of your region. At this time of enthusiastically promoting national products, the merchants are disregarding interests and supplying all seashells to Japanese merchants for purchase and secret export, related to interests and the future of tariffs, which is no small matter. This has led to national product factories stopping production and workers losing their jobs, which seriously affects society and the country. Therefore, we specially cable you, to maintain industry, protect unique products, and quickly order your subordinates to strictly suppress merchants monopolizing sales to Japanese merchants, and order customs to strictly investigate secret exports to maintain national products and prevent loopholes (remainder omitted), etc.</p>

One bullet struck Wang Chunguang in the right thigh, but did not exit. Wang was injured and fell to the ground, while these individuals took the opportunity to escape without a trace.

<h3>Investigation into the Copyright Infringement of Bingxun Shorthand</h3>
<p>Bingxun Shorthand was invented by Yang Bingxun, a Master's graduate of the University of Kansas in the United States. In the sixteenth year of the Republic [1927], he established his own school and began teaching it, bringing a unique brilliance to the academic world. However, due to insufficient experience, he was repeatedly criticized and almost committed suicide. Later, Mr. Yang ceased other work and dedicated himself to researching and improving the system, eventually achieving great success. Today, many Bingxun Shorthand graduates are serving in society and various government agencies, and they all express satisfaction. This spirit of great sacrifice is truly admirable. Unfortunately, a certain association in Nanjing, recognizing the urgent need for this new skill and the large number of public and private employees in Nanjing eager to learn shorthand to improve their career prospects, disregarded the biblical commandment against stealing. They hired a person surnamed Zhang to privately establish a Bingxun Shorthand school, altering and reprinting Bingxun Shorthand textbooks, charging each person six yuan per month plus miscellaneous fees and book fees. With only a superficial understanding, they misled young people. It is said that hundreds of people have been victimized. Now, in order to protect the rights and reputation of the Bingxun Shorthand system, Mr. Yang will engage in serious negotiations with the association and the person surnamed Zhang. It is deeply regrettable that a certain association, originally a moral institution, has resorted to such a low tactic for profit and speculation.</p>
<h3>Telegrams to Xinjiang Province to Have Reduced Fees Starting Tomorrow, Same as Telegram Fees to All Domestic Provinces and Regions, Shanghai-Fuzhou Line Clear, Can Arrive in Five Minutes</h3>
<p>The previous charging regulations for wired telegrams of the Ministry of Communications charged double for inter-provincial telegrams compared to intra-provincial ones. Later, it was changed to a uniform domestic telegram fee. However, frontier areas such as Xinjiang Province were still charged more than other provinces and regions due to the distance and cumbersome transfers. Recently, the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau received an order from the Ministry of Communications, to facilitate public communication, that from the first of next month, the price of telegrams sent from all parts of the country to Xinjiang will be reduced to the same as the current domestic price, i.e., one dime per Chinese character and two dimes per English character or code. In the Anxi-Hami area, before the telegraph lines are repaired, they can be relayed by the Tianjin and Lanzhou radio stations and directly reach Dihua. According to Mr. Hua Shijian, the business director of the bureau, the telegraph line between Shanghai and Fuzhou is clear, and telegrams sent from Shanghai to Fuzhou can arrive in five minutes.</p>

<h3>Hu Xiyuan Invites Electric Bulb Manufacturers to a Discussion Meeting to Find Ways to Remedy the Chaotic Market Price</h3>
<p>Hu Xiyuan, chairman of the Shanghai Electrical Appliances Manufacturers Association, recognizing that the recent economic downturn has affected the sales of various domestic goods, particularly electric bulbs, leading to chaotic market prices, making transactions difficult for manufacturers and causing electric material merchants to take a wait-and-see attitude when stocking goods. Smaller operators, eager for turnover, are even selling at a loss. If this continues, prices will become increasingly chaotic and impossible to regulate. Therefore, Mr. Hu plans to invite representatives from various electric bulb factories to a dinner meeting at the Yiyou Club at No. 9 Sanma Road at 6 PM on December 4 to discuss remedies. Mr. Hu stated that this matter concerns the interests of each factory.

<h3>"Ram Brand" Woolen Yarn Is Indeed a Domestic Product, Produced by Tianjin Dongya Textile Company, Managed by Shanghai World Trade Company, Sincere Company Opens Handicraft Exhibition</h3>
<p>The World Trade Company sent a letter to this newspaper yesterday stating that the "Ram Brand" woolen yarn, which is popular in the market and entirely domestically produced, is manufactured by Tianjin Dongya Woolen Textile Co., Ltd. Mr. Song Feiqing, the manager of the company, began preparing to establish the factory after the September 18th Incident [Mukden Incident]. Before the national crisis, the senior staff of the company were mostly engaged in import and export businesses. After the national crisis occurred, they found the above business to be quite uninteresting. In order to save the country, there was no other way than to fundamentally develop the domestic industry. Therefore, they gathered shares and established a completely domestic woolen yarn factory to block the leak of foreign yarn imports over the years. The company is entirely Chinese-owned and has already reported to the Ministry of Industry for registration and has received a national product certificate No. 65. Moreover, it was found that at the beginning of spinning, the company only produced 50 pounds of yarn per day, with waste yarn reaching over 600 pounds. Because of the determination not to hire foreigners, the company lost tens of thousands of yuan in the first few weeks of spinning. Fortunately, through the painstaking research of Mr. Song Feiqing, the manager of the company, and Mr. Song Xiafei, the technician, day and night, there is the result of today. The company appointed the World Trade Company at No. 29 Aidao Road in Shanghai as the general manager of the East China region. Recently, a small number of vendors selling enemy goods and foreign goods in Shanghai, due to the impact of the company's "Ram Brand" woolen yarn being of high quality and low price, have spread rumors everywhere, falsely accusing it of being enemy goods, hoping to undermine our national industry. It is hoped that ladies and gentlemen who love to use Ram Brand woolen yarn, if they have any questions, can go to the World Trade Company at No. 29 Aidao Road to inquire, and it will be clear whether it is a domestic product.</p>
<h3>Ms. Miao Fenghua</h3>
<p>Since Sincere Company, in conjunction with Dongya Woolen Textile Company, held an exhibition of handicraft products made with domestic Ram Brand woolen yarn, ladies from all walks of life have flocked to visit it and have praised it in unison. Some even bring their knitting needles every day to practice on the spot, and Ms. Miao Fenghua teaches each one individually and gives enthusiastic guidance. Because the exhibition period is short and there are many visitors, the company fears that it has not yet become widespread, so it has specially requested Ms. Miao to continue teaching ladies.</p>

<h3>Transfers and Enrollment in Middle and Normal Schools Should Comply With Regulations, Jiangsu Education Department Orders Education Bureaus in Various Counties to Strictly Prohibit Schools From Accommodating and Making Concessions</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Education Department ordered middle and normal schools to issue transfer certificates and accept enrolled students in accordance with regulations. Yesterday, it ordered the education bureaus of various counties, stating that the regulations for middle and normal schools stipulate that students who have been held back for one year and still cannot advance should be issued a certificate of completion and ordered to withdraw. Enrolled students must have transfer certificates or transcripts from other middle or normal schools with connecting semesters, and still must undergo a class placement test. Students who have been expelled from school shall not be issued school certificates or completion certificates. Restrictions are extremely strict, so as to unify standards and rectify the academic atmosphere. However, schools often make concessions by issuing transfer certificates and completion certificates to students who have been held back or expelled. Enrolled students, even without transfer certificates or transcripts from other middle or normal schools with connecting semesters, can still be accommodated and accepted, all of which are contrary to the law. The end of the semester is approaching, and it is urgently necessary to strictly prohibit this. In addition to distributing this order, the head of the bureau is ordered to instruct the public and private middle and normal schools under their jurisdiction to comply with the regulations and not to deviate. This is the order.</p>

<p>To the schools concerned: Since our association began implementing the screening of educational films, we have been gratified by the enthusiastic assistance of various parties over the past two months, which has prevented delays and setbacks. Now, in order to earnestly fulfill our original intention of assisting educational development, we have decided to actively go to various schools in the city to screen films starting from December. Each school will be scheduled to take turns twice a month, with one screening per time. The screening will be conducted within the school premises as a principle. Screening fees will be completely waived, and only transportation fees (based on distance) and the cost of printing explanatory materials (14 cents per 100 sheets) will be collected to reduce the burden on schools, with the aim of popularization. We have submitted a request to the Municipal Education Bureau to notify and implement this plan. However, detailed information regarding the traffic situation of each school, the screening venue, and the appropriate screening time is urgently needed for investigation to understand the actual situation and facilitate allocation. Therefore, we are sending this special letter to your institution, along with a survey form for detailed completion. Please return it promptly so that we can plan and facilitate implementation.</p>
<p>Screening Methods: (1) The screening venue must have dark curtains to block sunlight, which must be prepared in advance. (2) A screen (usually 15 feet wide and 12 feet high) should be prepared. If, due to special circumstances, the size of the screening venue can be adjusted and made in accordance with the size of the venue. (3) If the auditorium (dining hall or classroom) cannot accommodate all students, an additional screening will be required. Each additional screening will incur a loss fee of ten dollars for equipment and film. (4) After the association has completed the investigation and scheduling, please include the scheduled screening time in the curriculum. Once the screening time has been scheduled, it must be implemented accordingly and must not be changed arbitrarily. If, due to special circumstances, the screening cannot be held, the association must be notified three days in advance. (6) Before each screening, the equipment must be completely prepared so that the association's equipment can be screened upon arrival, without affecting the screening time of other schools. (7) If screening in the playground, it must be done in the evening. Screening will be suspended in case of rain. (8) If there are too many students, the school may rent a theater for screening. If the association is required to rent it on their behalf, an additional 20 dollars will be charged for each theater rental. (9) If the school is unable to screen the equipment and films due to unforeseen circumstances after they have been transported to the school, the transportation costs shall still be borne and paid by the school.</p>

<h3>Chinese Team Still Participates in the International Race Walking - The Group Still Participates - The Race Walking Association Accepts the Advice of Shen Siliang and Others - A Resolution Was Passed Unanimously at Yesterday's Meeting</h3>
<p>The Shanghai International Race Walking Competition is scheduled to be held on the 10th of next month. Due to the racecourse's excuse, the finish line has been changed to Yiyuan, and the distance has been shortened to just over fifteen miles. It is reported that participants include countries such as Britain, France, Italy, the United States, and Russia. Our Chinese team, in view of preparing to participate in the 50,000-meter race walking event in 1936, had formulated a three-year plan and actively progressed. Those who joined the training were all veterans. Therefore, we were unable to participate in this year's International Race Walking Competition, only participating individually. However, after the announcement of the news, it caused a sensation in Shanghai. Letters of condolence to the Chinese Race Walking Association came from all walks of life, all of which were in agreement. Some even suggested that individuals should not participate either. The association is deeply grateful for their concern. However, Li Te, the president of the International Race Walking Association, Vice President Mai Kaina, and the General Secretary Hekesilaidi approached Shen Siliang, Zhou Jiaqi of the National Sports Association, and He Yize, the president of the association, to persuade them to join the group to increase interest. It is learned that Cheng Yize, Shen Siliang, Zhou Jiaqi, and others have advised the Race Walking Association to hold another meeting and make a decision. The association held a special committee meeting at the Moore Hall at 6:30 PM yesterday. Six members, including Shi Youhui, Zhou Quanyu, Shi Quansheng, Yu Zichen, Zhang Zaojiu, and Lu Yutian, attended. As a result of the discussion, since we have accepted the advice of the Sports Association and the president, we should accept it and still join the group, giving newcomers the opportunity to increase experience, so that excellent talents can be added to the training for the 50,000-meter long-distance race walking, and expressed cooperation with the International Race Walking Association to facilitate progress. Therefore, it was unanimously passed to join the group and select from the ten people who were originally scheduled. However, the official representatives will be determined after the training this Sunday.</p>
<h3>Xiqing Women's Basketball League Opens Yesterday - The Chinese Team Remains Undefeated - Southeast A Beats the Blue Team丨20-6 - Southeast B Beats Mai Ling丨33-23 - Liangjiang Beats the Elementary Association丨44-10</h3>
<p>The Xiqing Women's Basketball League began last night, and all three Chinese teams won. The most notable result was Southeast B's defeat of Mai Lings. The three forwards were very accurate in shooting, and their coordination was also good, but their experience was insufficient. They need more time. Southeast A's win over the Blue Team was unremarkable. Liangjiang's win over the Elementary Association was also not a masterpiece. The results of the four games last night are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Southeast A Beats the Blue Team 20-6</p>
<p>(2) Southeast B Beats Mai Ling 33-23</p>
<p>(3) Liangjiang Beats the Elementary Association 44-10</p>
<p>(4) American Women Beat the Yellow Team 35-19</p>
<h3>Southeast A Gets Off to a Good Start</h3>
<p>The first game was between Southeast A and the Xiqing Blue Team. Southeast was unfamiliar with the smaller venue, so they were quite flustered at the beginning. In addition, the forwards lacked coordination, Liao Zhuyuan was too hasty, Ren Shu was timid, and Liu Wenhua lacked stability. Only Xu Wenying was more active. Xiang Shaofen was the best among the guards, followed by Zou Shande. The opponents were mediocre, but they had a height advantage. In the first quarter, Southeast only took a 3-2 lead. They gradually improved afterward, taking a 10-4 lead in the first half. The final result was Southeast winning 26.</p>

<h3>Southeast B Performs Excellently</h3>
<p>In the second game, Southeast B faced Mai Ling Women's Team. It was predicted beforehand that Southeast had a bad omen, as one was a rising new force, and the other had a solid track record. However, after the clash, Southeast showed its edge, surprising the opponent, who had no time to defend. Qian Kunge opened the scoring. After the opponent's Hammlun scored a goal, Xue Jinhua also scored one. Chen Xichun did not want to be outdone, and the audience applauded. The performance was better than Group A. In the first quarter, the score was 14-5. In the first half, it was 20-9. The only drawback was the lax defense. In the third quarter, Xue Jinhua was effective on both sides, hitting every shot. It was unexpectedly good. However, in the fourth quarter, the opponent quickly caught up with an intense momentum. Both of Southeast's rear guards were alarmed and unable to cope. The final score was 33-23, with Southeast winning by 10 points.</p>

<h3>Liangjiang Team Easily Defeats Elementary</h3>
<p>The elementary school fiercely resisted, causing Liangjiang to be cautious. A. Kelasha of the elementary school opened the scoring with a free throw. Chen Rongming of Liangjiang followed with a shot. Miss Ke of the elementary school then scored a point. The two sides struggled fiercely, and it was difficult to increase the score. Yang Sen was not willing to be outdone and tried to score, scoring two goals in a row. The first quarter was 8-2. In the second quarter, Liangjiang gradually showed its edge, and Chen Rongming repeatedly scored, creating a one-sided situation, ending the first half at 23-6. At the beginning of the second half, Liangjiang's lineup was chaotic and unproductive, and the situation suddenly became tense again. Moreover, both sides advanced and retreated in disorder, greatly reducing interest. Fortunately, in the fourth quarter, Liangjiang continued its efforts and soared to victory, winning 44-10.</p>

<h3>Officials Neglect Their Duties</h3>
<p>The most orderly organizer of the Xiqing basketball league was in the past when Smith was in charge. After Smith left, the successor, Blancotte, was a step behind. But now Blancotte has changed to another business, and the person who replaced him is not as good as Blancotte. Therefore, everything lacks thoroughness. Even the employed basketball recorders and timers are ignorant and inexperienced. Rather than saying they make a hundred mistakes, it is better to say they are amateurs who know nothing about the game. Also, the referees are new roles with a smattering of knowledge. Compared to the Chinese, they are like a small witch seeing a great witch. In short, it is like a child's play.</p>

<h3>Third Public Exhibition Cup Second Day - The Chinese Team Still Holds the Upper Hand - The Chinese Team Scored a Total of Six Points, and the Western Team Scored Four Points - The Key to the First Cycle is Tomorrow's Doubles</h3>
<p>On the second day of the Public Exhibition Cup International Handball Tournament last night, there were a total of five singles matches, and the competition was extremely fierce. The Chinese team lost narrowly by two to three, but the total score for the two days was still six to four, taking the lead. The key to the victory or defeat in the first cycle lies in tomorrow's doubles. The Chinese team only needs to win two groups to win. Therefore, the opportunity is better. In the second group match yesterday, Hong Jun fought hard against Roberts and won one game. In the last two games, Roberts launched a fierce counterattack, especially with his left-handed kill shots, winning two games in a row. In the fourth group match, Huang Ke and his opponent each won one game first. Ke had a strong physique, and he won the last game. The competition in the sixth group, Pi Cheng, was also quite close. In the eighth group, Gao won over He with skill. In the tenth group, Ge was defeated by Sun. The results are attached as follows:</p>
<p>(2) Roberts (West) (16丨21 21丨9 21丨9) Hong Yukui (China)</p>

<h3>All Kinds of Difficulties - Jiangnan and Baihong Confrontation - Cannot Be Held This Week - Baihong Replies to Jiangnan Proposing Expansion - Postponed to Early March Next Spring</h3>
<p>Baihong received a battle schedule from Jiangnan yesterday, scheduled for this Saturday. As Baihong team members are from all walks of life, including industry, commerce, academia, and politics, it is difficult for everyone to take time off to attend except on Sundays. Therefore, it is impossible to fight on Saturday. As for this Sunday, due to the engagement with the Huaguang team to participate in the cross-country race, the registration has already been made, and it is difficult to change. It is impossible to confront Jiangnan again (unless the 800-meter, 1,500-meter, and 10,000-meter events are cancelled, but that is unreasonable). Next Sunday (December 10th) is the date for the "Team Member Group" sports meeting of Baihong, which was a resolution of the Baihong annual meeting last year. It is at the request of all team members. Before the annual meeting this year (December 17th), there is only this one day available. Therefore, the holding of this meeting is truly unavoidable. Afterwards will be December 17th, which is the date of the Baihong annual meeting. Although the annual meeting may be postponed for a week, the weather at that time is also worth considering. It is heard that Baihong has replied to Jiangnan according to the above situation, requesting consideration. It is also heard that the Baihong team was very excited to receive the Jiangnan battle schedule. If a competition is not possible this year, it is proposed that it be held on the first Sunday of March next spring, and it is also proposed to invite the Huaguang and Zhonghua teams to participate, so that the four strongest Chinese track and field teams can gather in one place, increasing interest and preparing for the long-distance transport. The Baihong team will soon invite Jiangnan, Huaguang, and Zhonghua for a consultation on this matter.</p>
<h3>Qinghai Athletes Will Return to Their Province Soon</h3>
<p>(Beijing News) The five athletes who arrived late after the closing of the National Games were approved by the executive authorities of the National Games to be issued publications and prizes. However, although the application for subsidies was approved, the amount has not yet been determined and issued. Therefore, they are still staying in hotels awaiting orders. It is now heard that the association has determined to give a subsidy of 200 yuan, which was collected by the Qinghai athletes yesterday. As for the free train tickets, the Ministry of Railways has replied that it has approved a 25% discount and has sent a telegram to the Jinpu and Longhai Railways to comply and requested that the athletes be notified to contact the station. It is heard that the National Games sent a letter to Zhao Yongjian, the leader of the Qinghai athletes, on the 28th, hoping that he would go to the station to contact them directly. The Qinghai athletes are expected to return to their province within the next few days.</p>
<h3>Chinese Football Chinese Character Group - Zhihua Changed to Play Yasai on Sunday</h3>

However, some players have joined two teams, which violates Article 4 of the regulations. These individuals should come forward immediately to declare which team they belong to; otherwise, their names will be removed from both teams.</p>
<h3>Hua Guang and Fei Ma Jointly Organize Fei Hua Cup Open Cross-Country Race; Registration Closes This Afternoon; Officially Held on the 3rd of Next Month</h3>
<p>The Fei Hua Cup Cross-Country Race, organized by the Hua Guang Track and Field Team and the Fei Ma Cross-Country Team, is scheduled to be held at Fudan University in Jiangwan at 3:00 PM on December 3rd (Sunday). As of yesterday, the participants who registered include Bai Hong, Jiang Nan, Pu Guang, Chen Guang, Private Shang Zhong, Hong Hei, Qi Ma, and Liu Xing teams, in addition to Hua Guang and Fei Ma. Among them, Bai Hong and Jiang Nan are the strongest, but the other teams also have considerable talent. It is difficult to predict who will win. When the long-distance runners of Shanghai gather in one place, there will definitely be a grand occasion. According to the secretary of the Hua Guang team yesterday, if there are any changes in the list of each team, please notify them by letter two days in advance, as temporary arrangements are quite time-consuming.</p>

<h3>The Marriage Rumor of a Standard Beauty</h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>丨Nothing is as dangerous as human desires; Wise men should stop rumors early丨</p>
<p>Miss Yang Xiuqiong, the only swimming champion in the National Games, was known as the "Invincible General on Water" and even nicknamed "Water Monster" in the South China Swimming Club. Since winning the National Games championship, she has been hailed as a "Standard Beauty." Since then, reporters from various newspapers have served as her "chroniclers," recording her every word and deed, showing the extraordinary value of a "Standard Beauty's" records. Unexpectedly, a Hong Kong newspaper recently reported a strange piece of news: the "Standard Beauty" is going to marry Chen Xiangyuan, a Fujianese man in his forties who often suffers from stomach ailments! That a "Standard Beauty" cannot marry a standard husband is something everyone feels aggrieved about on her behalf. Later, after investigation, it was found that this was a fabricated story, but it was enough to make everyone run around telling each other about it in hushed tones. Xunzi said, "Rumors stop with the wise." Any unfounded rumor easily spreads, which is a sign of a lack of reason in society.</p>
<p>Chen Xiangyuan is an important employee of the Guangxi Bank of Hong Kong and a good friend of "Standard Beauty's" father, Yang Zhunan. Mr. Chen is a senior friend of "Standard Beauty's." Their acquaintance naturally leads to mutual visits. Moreover, Mr. Chen already has a wife, so marriage is absolutely impossible. After a certain newspaper disclosed the news of Yang and Chen's marriage, reporters all went to interview Mr. Chen. Mr. Chen strongly denied the rumor and wrote a poem to clarify the truth: "Not worried about holes bored or walls pierced, Can market tigers disturb my dreams? Nothing is as dangerous as human desires; I still hope wise men will stop rumors."</p>
<p>"Standard Beauty" was extremely indignant after reading the newspaper about the slanderous rumors. It is said that she has entrusted lawyer Luo Wenjin to sue a certain newspaper. How the truth will come to light remains to be seen as the facts unfold.</p>
<p>"Standard Beauty" is not afraid of storms. She has repeatedly won water championships in swimming pools. However, surface storms are not to be feared; land storms are to be dreaded. Tangible storms are not to be feared; intangible storms are to be worried about. I hope that the Standard Beauty who conquers storms can also defeat those who create waves and spread rumors.</p>
<h3>Lamenting a Sick Chrysanthemum</h3>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>When Gong Zizhen wrote "Record of a Sick Plum Studio" in the past, critics said it contained revolutionary ideas, because "plum" originally, in terms of the life force of plants, is really very free; why should it be pruned and cut by gardeners from a young age, so that a lush and straight upward, very developed branch, actually becomes a bent and winding twig, only then is it considered pleasing to the eye, called quaint; this really would require a theorist to argue right and wrong, and they probably wouldn't be able to tell the justice of it! Is it possible that since both are living things, plants (scientists say that plants have life force, but no consciousness, but that's not really the case,) should be abused by animals? (Humans are the masters of naked creatures, so humans are essentially animals, and not a different kind,) so I look at the current "autumn chrysanthemums" according to Mr. Gong's meaning, although they are among the three paths, with abundant flowers all over the ground, generally people are happy and joyful, greatly appreciating them, but in my eyes and heart, I seem to have some pity for them, and I can't help but sigh loudly at the "chrysanthemum" for a moment, alas! "Chrysanthemum," why is the fate of your life so bitter!</p>
<p>The nature of the "chrysanthemum" was originally like that of a recluse, so Tao Yuanming loved "chrysanthemums" as much as his life because "people" and "chrysanthemums" are like close friends, "chrysanthemums" are "people," and "people" are "chrysanthemums." The Poetry Grades say it well, calling "people talking like chrysanthemums," you should know that this is the reason, not just empty talk. From the opposite perspective, then the "chrysanthemum" definitely does not want to be close to people who are not of the Tao Yuanming type, which can also be imagined; but like the current era, where is there still Tao Yuanming, and the "chrysanthemum" is still enjoying the autumn light, swaying to people in the midst of the rustling west wind, releasing a spirit like a hundred folds and unyielding, opening many flowers; the personality and essence of the "chrysanthemum" are still like those of Tao Yuanming, his ambition, backbone, until now, will never change; alas! If "chrysanthemum" could speak, I don't know how much I would say with emotion, "things are still like this, why are people not like them," it can be seen that although "chrysanthemum" is insignificant, a kind of embellishment in round art, in fact, these people's eyes, as if something important has happened, go to appreciate "chrysanthemums," it is really not worth "chrysanthemum's" consideration!</p>
<p>What I don't understand most is that "chrysanthemums" are very natural, but people want to add artificial effort to do affectation, "because they hate the thin waist leaning on the bamboo fence, fearing that the seedlings will grow long and plant in瓦盆," just imagine the "chrysanthemum" in this unfree process, surviving in life, his encounters can be described as experiencing all kinds of hardships, even if he wants to struggle, and in the past he enjoyed the happiness in the fields under the eastern fence, where can he get it? Not enough, he also has to be taken to the hall, held high on a shelf, and in the corner of the wall, piled up like a mountain, calling people to praise and write, thinking that he has bestowed a good name, and also like the feudal era, distributing the authority of the feudal lords, in fact, he has actually compared "chrysanthemums" with prostitutes, not much wrong; at night, he also turns on the electric light, shining on the color of the flowers, dazzling and strange, in the sound of guessing fists, the fat-bellied and full-brained people blast the "chrysanthemums" as if they were drunk with mud, and can't wake up, you! Think about it, is "chrysanthemum" living in the world like falling into a fire pit, and still enjoying a carefree life! Alas! "Chrysanthemum," you are sick, there is no one to call for liberation for you, you! Why don't you get up and jump out of the encirclement yourself?</p>
<h3>Man Jiang Hong Crying for Huan Gu</h3>
<p>— Gu Fei</p>
<p>After the geese and before the frost. How many things are so sad. I have always relied on my aunt for comfort. My eyebrows are tied in a thousand knots. Unexpectedly, today the heavens have collapsed and separated us. The peach blossom pool water is empty and sobbing. I ask if the wandering soul is far away and cannot return. Let's start again. Holding hands, the railing is broken. In the place of continuous chanting, the flowers are still blooming. I remember clearly that we agreed to watch the moon by the reed. The wise cause has no evidence in heaven. The strings of the burnt piano are broken and the high song stops. Only the lights float in the sea corner, who knows? My intestines are torn apart.</p>
<h3>The Educational Significance of "Fragrant Herbs and Beauties"</h3>
<p>— Xin Chun</p>
<p>Today, it is undeniable that movies should become a powerful tool for educating the masses in order to fulfill their social existence value.</p>
<p>However, how should we define the accurate definition of this vague and general term called education? That is to say: What kind of "education" do the Chinese masses currently need?</p>
<p>China is a semi-colonial country, and all political and commercial facilities are subject to the constraints of imperialism. Especially the economic aggression that kills without bloodshed, it not only affects the path of Chinese national capital development, but also causes the vast majority of the Chinese working people to suffer its scourge. If we say how movies should educate the masses, I think exposing the hideous face of imperialism should be the most important theme.</p>
<p>Recently, the Star Film Company's new film "Fragrant Herbs and Beauties," which is about to be released, is a work that attempts to accomplish the above mission.</p>
<p>"Fragrant Herbs and Beauties" takes Wang Ada, a carpenter in a cigarette factory, as the protagonist, and depicts how his family struggles for survival: At first, Ada's younger brother, wife, and daughter all worked in the same cigarette factory. Although life was very hard, they barely had enough to eat. Soon, this cigarette factory was squeezed out by foreign tobacco merchants, and its business gradually dimmed. Ada's wife and daughter both lost their jobs. Finally, the cigarette factory could not help but be squeezed out and closed down. As a result, Ada and his younger brother also lost their jobs. His young and strong brother was also arrested and imprisoned on suspicion of "inciting a strike."</p>
<p>After Wang Ada lost his job, the family's livelihood became even more difficult. The daughter, in order to eat, went to work as a masseuse without her father's knowledge. However, Ada finally found out about this, so he clashed with his wife and daughter. The mother and daughter left in anger. As a result, Ada's life was completely plunged into a miserable situation. Then, his children got sick, and eventually their lives were hopeless. Ada, as if possessed by a demon, walked alone and blankly on the street. Suddenly, he saw a foreign cigarette store's counter window. He hated it so much that he punched it and smashed the display in the window. As a result, he was imprisoned for this crime.</p>
<p>From this story, "Fragrant Herbs and Beauties" clearly tells the audience: (1) Imperialist economic aggression is enough to plunge the majority of the working masses into a miserable fate. (2) The problem of livelihood is not solved, so there is no point in talking about chastity.</p>
<p>The director of the film is Chen Kengran, and the protagonists are Xia Peizhen, Xie Yunqing, and Wang Zhengxin. It is now being released. Only films like this can I believe are what the Chinese masses urgently need right now!</p>
<p>A letter was received regarding an article entitled "Needle" in this column on the 21st, signed by "Fu Hongliao," which was quite interesting. Since I, Bi Liao, have not written for a long time, the sudden discovery of someone with the same name will inevitably cause misunderstandings among friends. Furthermore, since I dare not take credit for others' work, I hereby declare this and ask you to take note!</p>
<p>Respectfully, Fu Hongliao</p>
<h3>Four Northeastern Company Commanders</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 19: Desiring to be Near Yet Also to Leave, Recalling Past Events in the Same Car; Half-Crying and Half-Laughing, Leaning on a Pillow, Sick in the Remaining Autumn</p>
<p>In her heart, she also regretted at the same time that such a good opponent had slipped through her fingers and was actually taken away by Zhao Ziqiang's soldier. It was really a pity. Ah! Why did he turn his face away and not look this way? So she smiled and said, "Big girl, won't you have a cigarette? I have some with me." Guizhi had to turn around and shake her head, saying, "I don't smoke, don't you know?" Ji Zhi didn't expect that a casual remark would reveal her secret, causing her to say, "Oh, that's right; it's been so long, I forgot." Guizhi said, "You should have forgotten." As she said this, she looked at her own pair of shoe tips, her voice very low. Ji Zhi looked at her face from the side, and it still had some smiles. He immediately recalled the scene when they went to the milk tea shop together in the past, her appearance both intimate and shy, and it reappeared before his eyes. Although her attitude was indifferent when they first met, it didn't seem that she completely rejected people. Seeing this situation, perhaps their feelings could be restored? As he thought this in his heart, he looked at half of her face, just seeing a patch of fine hairs growing under her ears, which perfectly showed her virginal beauty. Just looking at that white skin, he couldn't help but want to reach out and touch her cheek, but with so many people present, how could he dare to be rash? Therefore, he moved his hand twice, but then retracted it and kept it still. This action of his was just seen by Guizhi, who was immediately on guard in her heart, how could he dare to make a move in front of so many people, so she tightened her face and put on an angry look. Ji Zhi, of course, knew more clearly than her in his heart, so he straightened his face and put on a thoughtful look. The car was moving very fast, and soon they saw the tall buildings of the Xiyuan Barracks. (254)</p>

<h3>Peanut Kernels</h3>
<p>— Lin Ying</p>
<p>Peanut kernels are on the market again early.</p>
<p>Peanut kernels, it goes without saying, are the kernels of peanuts. This is the common name for Chinese people, but they are also called: peanut beans, peanut kernels, or longevity fruit meat, etc., with various titles. There is only a difference in the words, but the meaning is the same, and the object is also just one kind. That is, peanut, longevity fruit, kernel, head, nut, meat, so equal to peanut kernels, peanut beans, peanut kernels, longevity fruit meat.</p>
<p>The naming of peanuts in Chinese colloquial language, when we analyze it, there are usually three kinds: peanut, groundnut, longevity fruit. Peanut kernels are the essence of this peanut, which has been transformed by a bubble-making process. The methods of making this are usually roughly the following:</p>
<p>(1) Baking, that is, dry peanut kernels sold on the market, pepper and salt peanut kernels, or called pepper and salt fruit meat. There is also a kind of colored (coated with洋紅) peanut kernels in Peiping 丨丨 red peanut kernels, in fact, its taste is just so-so. In short, baked peanut kernels are most suitable for tea snacks.</p>
<p>(2) Deep-fried deep-fried peanut kernels. Divided into: with skin (popular along the Yangtze River) and naked (popular in Tianjin and Shanghai also has, but very little.) two kinds. (Note: "skin" refers to the inner skin of the peanut) In addition, sprinkling salt, in addition to tea snacks, is best for drinking. Many people use this as an appetizer. Ordinary people buy three copper plates of peanut kernels, and they can drink a lot of white liquor. There is a saying: it is called "strange wine does not blame the dishes." The masses of Chinese Pro's drinking frenzy are probably like this when they drink.</p>
<p>(3) Sugar-boiled There are many tricks here: the most common is peanut candy, but in peanut candy there are also various forms and nature of distinction, it is estimated that there are more than a hundred kinds; among them, the most common are milk peanut candy, water chestnut-shaped peanut candy, square peanut candy, peanut candy bars, peanut soft candy... There are too many names here to list. In addition, there are also many raw foods made with peanuts as the main or secondary raw material, and the word peanut is omitted in the name. To say it succinctly: countless. From this, we know that peanuts are the most common and main raw material in food, and it plays an important role in some foods. Furthermore, it is necessary to admit that peanuts are the king of food. If we don't eat any snacks, as soon as we eat, you will surely meet it.</p>
<p>(4)煉製 A peanut shortbread B peanut cake C peanut flour, etc. In addition to the above, there are also: brine peanuts (there are two kinds with shell and shelled) rain skin peanuts (imitation) and sugar peanuts, etc. Original shell peanuts, generally only water boiled and dry fried two kinds. There are two kinds of peanuts, large and small, the large one is full of meat, the small one (also called sand peanuts) has a fragrant and crispy taste. In agricultural products, it is second only to rice, wheat, and beans, and is a major production. The output accounts for a large part of agricultural products. The annual export is also a lot. According to the comparison table of export goods to foreign countries in the Customs in 1932, peanuts and their products accounted for 1.76% of the country's exports. China is the most abundant place for peanut production, especially in the provinces north of the Yangtze River.</p>
<p>Are peanuts really delicious? Don't ask; go and see: old women and old men, old masters and ladies, young mistresses and young masters and misses, elder sisters and old maids who have not yet lost all their teeth. Old guys and guys, especially younger brothers and younger sisters, etc. Who among them has not eaten peanut kernels? Who doesn't like to eat it?</p>
<p>In the book field, in the tea house, and even on the road, isn't someone chewing peanuts with relish?</p>
<p>China is a country that worships peanuts and melon seeds. In marriage and happy events, peanuts are dyed red to make "happy fruits" as a symbol of "auspiciousness." As for entertaining guests and offering sacrifices to gods, that is even more common.</p>

<h3>Everyone, Let's Do Some Calculating</h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Yunwu said: "What scientific method, what scientific management, in short, is to ask everyone to do some calculating first." This is very meaningful, especially for those who run national goods businesses, they should pay more attention to it. How to collect raw materials? How to reduce costs? How to carefully select and reduce workers? How to make excellent products? How can business compete with others? How can sales be expanded? Everyone, let's do some calculating, and we can have very good results. It is definitely not possible to succeed by being confused, relying on heaven for food, or relying on others for food. As for managing personnel, everyone also needs to move the abacus beads, compare the numbers, how to make them work hard? How to increase their efficiency? Everything needs to be displayed from the numbers. Mr. Yunwu said: "The current era is definitely not about managing people with whips, nor is it about managing people with kowtows, but about managing people with numbers." It is even more of a pointed remark.</p>
<p>However, calculating is not only for oneself, but also for others. At present, the situation of national goods is that foreign goods are competing with us everywhere. How do we, who run national goods businesses, make the price cheaper? Suitable for the purchasing power of the people? How to make the quality strong and beautiful, comparable to foreign goods? How to provide thoughtful service, respond with humility and harmony, and satisfy customers? It is said that there is a shop that specializes in using low-paid employees, thinking that it is saving expenses and considering it a good plan. Who knew that these employees were listless, offending customers, thinking it was commonplace, and when they were unhappy, they would even do some anti-propaganda for national goods. As a result, it is useless to others and harmful to oneself. This is the result of calculating wrong.</p>

<h3>National Products Movement and Cooperation System</h3>
<p>— Wei Zhong</p>
<p>Advocating for national products must start with increasing production; this has almost become a unanimous consensus. However, our current economic status as a colony is groaning under the iron heel of international capitalism. Hoping that the backward national products industry can rise is truly easier said than done. But if we have meticulous and detailed organization, a courageous and determined spirit, and apply modern production and scientific management to develop industry and revitalize the economy, I believe that "an iron rod can be ground into a needle," and there will eventually be a day of success. Below, I will introduce to comrades engaged in and concerned about the national products movement an economic organization suitable for our national conditions, which is also the most practical and effective way to increase the production of national products.</p>
<p>The production system is indeed the most serious problem at present, and one that we must seriously consider. The capitalist system has fully exposed its extreme, contradictory, and conflicting weaknesses in Europe and the United States. We can learn from past mistakes and must not repeat them, lest we put the country and society in a terrible situation in the future.</p>
<p>The cooperative system is built on the free mutual understanding of "everyone for me, and me for everyone." Based on the principle of self-help and mutual assistance, and in the spirit of equality, it involves jointly participating in an industrial organization to seek the economic interests and increased interest base among the economically weaker parties. It does not aim to extract profits, nor does it use strife and plunder as a means. It uses peaceful methods to engage in rational production "for consumption." It is indeed the most suitable production system for our national conditions at this moment.</p>
<p>In a cooperative organization, there is no distinction between high and low status; everyone has the right to suggest, manage, and supervise implementation. The organization is meticulous, and the steps are steady, so there is no concern about corruption by a few people. Moreover, everyone participates based on common needs and interests, so the combination arises automatically and has durability. The benefits and harms are closely related to oneself and have commonality. The members of the cooperative organization can be firm and determined, holding a spirit of perseverance and working together with one heart and one mind, which is incomparable to a purely profit-seeking capitalist organization. Many of the malpractices under the modern capitalist economic organization can be avoided.</p>
<p>Increasing production is the primary condition, needless to say. However, in our extremely economically depressed society, existing enterprises are already gasping for breath and showing signs of lingering on. Where can we talk about expansion and development? At the same time, where can we find capital to break new ground and rebuild our national products enterprises? Here, the cooperative system tells you: the only way is to use the cooperative method to gather small and scattered amounts of money into one group. Isn't this a good way? The economic power of one person is limited and weak, but if many limited and weak forces are gathered in one group, wouldn't it become strong and abundant?</p>
<p>Without the power of unity and abundant capital, how can we develop the national products industry? How can we compete with foreign goods? Here, the cooperative system is even more suitable for our national products movement.</p>
<p>Talking about National Products</p>
<h3>Written to People Serving the National Products Industry</h3>
<p>— Xiao Bai</p>
<p>Because our country is a country with backward production, the national products industry, until now, is still only a swaddled child in its infancy. Although its progress is very fast, in recent years, amidst the overwhelming calls for advocating national products, its production and sales have already seen an astonishing increase. Thriving new factories have sprung up like bamboo shoots after a rain, and great and complete national products companies have already been established. Naturally, this is all thanks to the support of the national public and the crystallization of efforts to promote national products from all walks of life. However, on the other hand, we should not forget the hard work, efforts, and dedication of the people serving the national products industry. A factory often starts from extremely small capital, together with a very small number of employees, working hard and struggling to survive. It is only through gradual expansion that it achieves its current status. Naturally, it has sacrificed the blood and sweat of many people to exchange for this precious harvest. Therefore, I thought of several qualities that people serving the national products industry should possess, and wrote them down below. On the one hand, it is indeed hoped that it will serve as a reference for those who work in emerging industries. On the other hand, it is also intended to advise the employees of already successful national products factories to continue their efforts, remember the difficulties of starting a business in the past, and work harder.</p>
<p>(1) Spirit of Service I remember in the last issue of this journal, Mr. Pan Yangyao was still talking about how, assuming that in the organization of a national products enterprise, its products are good and the decoration is also beautiful, but if its shop assistants lack a spirit of service and offend customers at every turn, then it will inevitably suffer a major blow in business. Naturally, we must have concepts such as respecting our work and enjoying our work. When a person serves society, especially serving the most practical and important national products industry in the lower-level organizations of society, how should we better exert our inherent abilities, take responsibility, and strive to be promising? We must understand that the rise of the national products industry is the revival of social commerce and industry, so why not hold our aspirations and work hard in our duties! (2) Patience Because the national products industry completely relies on its own manufacturing improvements to achieve excellent products, it is an unavoidable fact that it takes blood, sweat, and effort to refine its products. Then, people serving the national products industry must resist with patience whenever they encounter a little hardship. We must understand that the suffering now is truly the success of the future. "Dripping water wears away stone" and "an iron rod can be ground into a needle." As long as the patience is firm, the business will inevitably develop and succeed. (3) Great Development Power Employees serving ordinary enterprises often consider fulfilling their own duties as the end. In fact, this concept is wrong. We, the people serving the national products industry, must work hard to correct it. We must take into account the entire future development of the business, the improvement of products, the expansion of business, the design of factories, the design of business departments, the ratio and statistics of sales and production, social conditions, the situation of markets in various places, and the needs of the people for the products of our factory. The same industry?</p>
<p>National Products Poetry</p>
<h3>Song for Encouraging the Use of National Products</h3>
<p>— Huang Kangtun</p>
<p>"According to" China has always been known as a vast land with abundant resources.</p>
<p>Everything does not require others, closed off for a thousand years, self-sufficient.</p>
<p>Since the opening of five ports for trade, various countries have competed for resources;</p>
<p>Foreign goods have become increasingly arrogant, and sales of national goods have shrunk.</p>
<p>Modern men and women fill the streets, all of them wearing and using non-Chinese items.</p>
<p>"Da La" The sands are washed away, and inferior goods fill the valleys.</p>
<p>Hundreds of millions are overspent every year, and the entire country is exhausted,</p>
<p>"Hereby" The people are poor and the finances are depleted, and the national lifeline is barely sustained.</p>
<p>This year is named National Products Year, and everyone should reflect and act quickly!</p>
<p>First, make a vow yourself to awaken the public and cooperate;</p>
<p>Clothing, food, housing, transportation "etcetera", push national products as much as possible.</p>
<p>No longer work for others, "it is reasonable" to seek more blessings for ourselves.</p>
<p>Loving the country is loving the seeds, and descendants will have longevity, joy, and blessings.</p>
<p>"The whole line" orders everyone to know and must respectfully obey without desecration!</p>
<p>What is the current situation, market price forecast, raw material situation, and the degree of cost reduction? People serving the national products industry must focus on these issues, constantly study them, and even if this duty is not related to me, I must take care of it with great development power, so that I can gain something and contribute it to the manager and director, which is indirectly benefiting society.</p>
<h3>Enemies of National Products</h3>
<p>— Tian Ran</p>
<p>Everyone is desperately promoting national products during National Products Year, but there are enemies of national products who are wreaking havoc in various places. I hate that there is no millstone to grind them, but fortunately, I have Wen Jiao's rhinoceros horn. I am writing this out for everyone to pay attention to:</p>
<p>(1) Changing the Face Chinese people are truly clever. It is clearly Japanese goods, but they insist on removing its signboard, changing it to a Chinese trademark, and selling it as national products in a grand manner, ultimately driving away compatriots who are enthusiastic about national products. These people earn dishonorable money. I don't know how their conscience can face themselves and others. There are many ways for a person to earn money. Why don't they do this or do that, but insist on doing this conscienceless and shameless thing? A friend said: "The dishonor of friends who sell Japanese goods is even worse than that of petty thieves and robbers. Petty thieves steal things, but they still do it secretly, working in the dark. Robbers rob things, but they still use their skills, without losing their masculinity." The skills of these people who sell Japanese goods are still below those of thieves. Recently, someone reported that a certain brand of velvet rope is suspected of being Japanese goods. We are investigating. If it is true, they deserve to die. Someone also reported that several factories used several small machines, nominally producing national products, but secretly used Japanese goods to fill in as national products for sale. We are also investigating and will expose them sooner or later.</p>
<p>(2) Offending Customers Doing national products business and offending customers, causing customers to leave in disappointment, or even prefer to buy foreign goods. These shop assistants are also enemies of national products and should be attacked with drums.</p>
<p>(3) Being Greedy for Cheapness Friends who are greedy for cheapness abandon national products and buy foreign goods. Their crime is the same as those who love fashion and abandon national products to buy foreign goods. It is said that there are many raw materials in China, but some factories abandon national products raw materials and buy inferior goods. Is it because they are crazy, or are they greedy for cheapness?</p>
<p>(4) Being Too Accommodating When the national government was first established, the very fashionable term was "no compromise," but now it is too accommodating. Everything is accommodating, and the regulation on marking the country of origin, which is a glimmer of hope for national products, is also going to be extended. This extension is not to please neighboring countries, but to be an enemy of national products.</p>
<h3>National Products Discussion How Should We Promote National Products in Rural Areas?</h3>
<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>When I started writing the article "The Countryside and the National Products Movement," I originally wanted to write about several of my own views on how young people should promote national products in the countryside, but as I wrote, I felt that the length was already very long, and the number of words was also quite a lot, so I changed my plan and only wrote "The Countryside and the National Products Movement" as one article, preparing to write another article on how to promote national products in the countryside. However, after "The Countryside and the National Products Movement" was published, Li Boshu followed up with an introduction to the Farmer's Cooperative in Caiqiao. In addition to expressing my sympathy for this type of cooperative, I felt that there were some other opinions that I wanted to publish in this journal.</p>
<p>Most people in the countryside are illiterate, and illiteracy is prevalent, so newspaper propaganda is completely ineffective. If you want to use newspapers and leaflets to publish some propaganda and promote national products, it is completely ineffective. In the countryside, the most effective method is oral propaganda. The first step in promoting national products in the countryside is to talk to individuals and give speeches to the public, explaining the dangers caused by Chinese people buying foreign goods and the dangers of foreign goods invading the countryside. First, we must make every farmer in the countryside have the mentality of loving national products and not wanting foreign goods to invade, and then we can establish various businesses such as cooperatives, service agencies, and national products small shops.</p>
<p>If a cooperative or similar business cannot be established in a village due to the population or other obstacles, then we should start with the fundamental aspects and use various methods to guide farmers so that they can identify which is foreign goods, which is enemy goods, and which is national goods. This is because some farmers are originally unwilling to buy foreign goods, but they cannot distinguish between foreign goods and national goods, so although they want to buy national goods, the result is that they buy foreign goods or enemy goods. Although we have been vigorously promoting them, and they have the determination to buy national goods, sometimes they are deceived by merchants, and foreign goods will also invade. Therefore, collecting various specimens or samples of foreign goods, enemy goods, and national goods so that they can recognize them under comparison is also an important task.</p>
<p>In the countryside, strictly speaking, except for a very small number of foreign goods that farmers directly buy in the cities, most of the inflow of foreign goods is due to the sale of those small shops in the townships. Therefore, we should not promote national products in the countryside unless we are already doing so, and if we want to promote national products in the countryside, then we should also persuade those small shops to promote purely national products and not sell foreign goods. If those small shops do not sell foreign goods, then most of the foreign goods in the countryside cannot invade.</p>
<p>At present, the worst phenomenon in the countryside is that the general youth, people who do not work outside their hometown, eat and sleep at home all day long. It is not that they are specialized in not doing good work, but they also want to gamble and smoke. Everyone can do something in the countryside, but they don't go to the countryside. As for the general people who want to go to the countryside, they cannot because of environmental constraints. As a result, no one goes to the countryside to shoulder the mission of promoting national products and revitalizing the countryside.</p>
<p>However, I believe that those village teachers, teaching in the villages, should shoulder these missions in their spare time after class. They are familiar with the people and close in distance. If they promote national products, give speeches and persuade people from time to time, the effect will definitely be more effective than ordinary people promoting them. However, in the countryside, how can those primary school teachers take care of these problems! They have the mindset of not meddling in other people's business, and after finishing their class a day, they don't ask about anything.</p>
<p>Not to mention primary school teachers, even those public education halls and farmer education halls, in the countryside, are also unable to work effectively and benefit the public or farmers. If the public education halls and farmer education halls earnestly go to the countryside to promote national products, there is a lot of work to be done, such as holding national products speeches, collecting national products specimens, compiling statistical tables of foreign goods invasion, and producing picture books and slogans, so that the general public and the general farmers can develop a mentality of loving national products and hating foreign goods, so that they can receive considerable results!</p>
<p>Contributing Opinions</p>
<h3>Starting from Fountain Pens</h3>
<p>— Shou</p>
<p>I bought a cheap and good-quality national products fountain pen from a national products company and clipped it to my chest, but it caused ridicule from my classmates.</p>
<p>"You bought a fountain pen? XX brand, Chinese goods!" At the same time, a contemptuous expression appeared on his face, meaning that Chinese goods are still ultimately substandard.</p>
<p>"Why? Are national products no good?" I was a little impatient. "Hum! It's fine if you don't use a fountain pen, but if you use one, you must use foreign goods, Parker, Conklin, they are beautiful, and..."</p>
<p>I originally wanted to argue with him a few words and ask him if he was planning to shoulder the heavy responsibility of revitalizing the country in the future? But then I saw his "unreasonable" state and turned away. Then, Professor X's poignant words of emotion appeared in my consciousness: "You can't find half a piece of Chinese paper in the wastepaper baskets of schools above the middle school level!"</p>
<p>The rise and fall of a country can be seen from the learning behavior of young students. If you want the people of the whole country to use national products, you must do it from within the schools. But the students of today, the so-called "masters of the country tomorrow," have such a strong mentality of blindly worshiping foreign goods! Western-style suits are of course the most fashionable, and at least the material for long gowns should be imported. Cloth jackets and long gowns are either dismissed as "poor ghosts" or respectfully called "Amaulin." In conversations, interspersing a few sentences of "foreign pidgin" is the way to show off. Even books should be bound with thick Western sheepskin covers to look impressive. Alas! The youth of the intellectual class are like this, what is the future of the country to think of?!</p>
<p>Educators who have the responsibility to reform and point out the path for the lost, please pay close attention to this serious problem when you are sitting high in the lecture hall!</p>
<h3>Talking about National Products Stationery</h3>
<p>— Xuan Wan</p>
<p>Foreigners' commercial aggression against us can indeed be described as meticulous. From the large-scale food of rice and wheat, the clothing of cotton and wool, to the small stationery, they have shown their strict skills to seek a monopoly in their markets. On the one hand, they are also waiting for the social situation in our country, taking advantage of our transition between the old and the new eras, the old-fashioned brushes and emblem ink are gradually being eliminated, while pens and inks are becoming increasingly needed. At present, in offices, school classrooms, and private homes, there is indeed a general situation of not being able to be without pens and inks for a moment, and the import of these foreign stationery is also increasing alarmingly year by year. The Chinese themselves do not try to create and replace these types of stationery, so in recent years, our country's stationery has only allowed these foreign goods to flood the entire society. Therefore, the problem of creating national products stationery is indeed the most urgent problem that our national products workers need to solve at present. Although Minsheng Ink Factory already has red and blue inks on the market, the pen shafts and nibs of pens have probably never been replaced by national products. Recently, Mr. Pan Yangyao and others initiated the organization of the Zhongnan Industrial Society, and the first achievement was this pen shaft, which is beautiful, strong, and far superior to imported products. It has already been launched on the market. We believe that this is satisfying and comforting, and it is indeed adding a special brilliance to national products this year. However, in the future, we also hope that they can have self-made pen tips, so that an entire pen can be made of national products.</p>
<p>Advocating old stationery and rejecting new stationery has already been proposed by general celebrities and scholars. Although we dare not blindly comment on this issue, in short, it should be based on needs. With the advancement of society and the changes in trends, the needs for stationery will naturally also undergo changes and improvements. If we are extremely distressed about the import of foreign goods, we should always work hard to design and manufacture our own products to cope with them. That is the right way to promote national products stationery and stop the leakage.</p>

<p>National Products Miscellaneous Talks</p>
<h3>Reflections from Indian Women's Advocacy of Local Products</h3>
<p>— Fei</p>
<p>I borrowed a copy of the Oriental Magazine, Volume 28, No. 3, from a friend, and read an article called "Indian Women's Non-Cooperation Movement against England." After reading it, I felt ashamed, because it contained the following about advocating local products:</p>
<p>"The Delhi women's anti-import cloth and liquor inspection team is well-organized, causing cloth merchants to seal foreign goods in one place themselves and hand the keys to the women's committee; they vowed not to sell foreign goods until the government and Gandhi reached an understanding... Indian bankers, importers, running merchants, and ordinary merchants reported to British commercial firms that the women's movement had cut off business opportunities, and telegrams were as numerous as snowflakes, which greatly alerted the British... The secretary of the former Delhi Cloth Association wrote to the secretary of the Manchester Chamber of Commerce in England, reporting the severity of the Indian women's movement: 'In any location in British India, it is absolutely impossible to sell a yard of foreign cloth, regardless of its value'... It is found that the general import of British goods has sharply reduced to 90%, and the complete slump of cotton fabrics is purely due to the existence of women inspectors in Mumbai, Kolkata, and other seaports to small villages. Retailers dare not purchase British goods from wholesalers, because they know that these goods will have no way to sell out..."</p>
<p>After reading the above, and then thinking about our Chinese resistance movement and the national products promotion movement, can people not feel ashamed? The women of a country facing subjugation, under the harsh iron heel of imperialists, were willing to sacrifice themselves for their nation and their country, because they were considered to be committing crimes for doing so, they went ahead regardless of everything, and in fact, they were victorious. But let's look back at our independent Republic of China? Our resistance movement, from May 30th, May 3rd, etc. until now, cannot be said to have no considerable history! And the method of resisting enemy goods and replacing them with other foreign goods has progressed to resisting foreign goods while promoting national products. This year has even been specially designated as National Products Year to promote them. On the surface, it is good enough, but where are the results? Although our movement has not stopped, the import of enemy goods, which once fell after September 18th, has long returned to its original state. Dear compatriots, compare these two achievements, what should you think! We don't need to ask others, just ask yourself whether you have done anything to promote national products and use national products. We don't need empty words, what we need is for everyone to do it in a down-to-earth manner. We cannot wait for foreigners to suck up all our fat and die. We should use our own strength to seek a way out. Compatriots, wake up!</p>
<h3>National Products Ramblings Courtesy</h3>
<p>— Qia</p>
<p>According to custom, when people have celebrations, they send gifts, and there is bound to be a move to open a list of gifts according to the etiquette. Usually, the etiquette is used as a standard, and the amount of respect is politely written on the reply card.</p>
<p>However, in families with a lot of social interactions, gift money is an extra income for servants, sometimes even exceeding their regular salary. However, this amount is only one-tenth of the value of the gift. If this is used as a standard to recalculate the amount of expenses for the host's social interactions, the return is very considerable.</p>
<p>In society, people who open businesses are originally seeking profits on the basis of capital. There is no opportunity to earn profits beyond expenses. However, since the opening of the sea ban, have there not been a small number of people who have become rich by selling imported goods in Shanghai? Then, the return is very substantial. From profit to capital, the things that are transported into other people's pockets are really not just this small amount!</p>
<p>Let me tell you! People who buy imported goods must be shocked. People who sell them must also wake up. The meager profits obtained from foreign goods only have the effect of a single force. Seeing the gift money, you should understand the huge amount of the gift. Taking the gift money, you should also recognize that the loss outweighs the gain!</p>
<h3>The Fascistization of the National Products Movement</h3>
<p>— Pillow Wood</p>
<p>This year is the National Products Year for the National Products Movement. Nine-tenths of the National Products Year has already passed, but what are the results? Are 75% of people using national products? Of course, this is a hope that surpasses reason, but we must at least strive to thoroughly promote and use national products. Here, the reporter wants to borrow a fashionable term to "fascistize" the National Products Movement: "Fascistization" means strict discipline, bold methods, consistent thinking, and resolute will. To revitalize national products, we must implement fascistization. As for the implementation of fascistization, the smaller the basic unit cell, the better. The following are listed separately:</p>
<p>First: Family National Product Fascist. The unit of our country's society is not the individual, but the family. Therefore, the family can be called the most minute unit. Every family head can take the lead, forcefully encourage, and strictly stipulate regulations for using national products, so there is no fear that foreign goods will not disappear.</p>
<p>Second: Store National Product Fascist. Stores can be said to be the most numerous groups outside of our country's families. The store owners must first advocate that store clerks are not allowed to share dividends if they use foreign goods. Because salaries are the wages of each person's hard work, and dividends, although they are rewards for service, are extra income and may be canceled and used for public fines. If this is the case, there is no worry that the sales of national products will not increase.</p>
<p>Third: School National Product Fascist. If all the large, medium, and small, as well as specialized schools in the country, can eliminate foreign goods, the recovery of annually lost profits would be more than millions of gold. Primary schools should be led by the principal. In large, medium, and specialized schools, teachers and staff should be led by the principal, and students should be responsible by each class leader. They should guide and supervise each other, all use national products, and try their best to replace with national products. Violators will be severely punished.</p>
<p>Fourth: Government Agency National Product Fascist. Government agency staff serve the national government and are models for the people. They should be the pioneers of the National Products Movement and should organize National Product Fascists by bureau and section to promote it.</p>
<p>Others, whenever there are three or five people with similar interests, can organize National Product Fascists and resolve to use national products. Finally, the reporter wants to explain that the unit cells of the National Product Fascists can be organized separately as above, but they must all unite with each other, expand the scope to increase momentum, so that the examination and investigation of goods can be refined, and the evidence and means of rewards and punishments can be tightened, so that we can hope for the uniformity of using national products. Otherwise, even if we break our throats and become mute, and we desperately publicize and shout loudly, what good will it do? Therefore: the only way is to fascistize the National Products Movement! Remember it! Our patriotic compatriots of the Republic of China!</p>
<h3>Random Notes on National Products</h3>
<p>— Lin Nian</p>
<p>She wears a cloth cheongsam, and a diamond ring on her finger. Is she advocating frugality? Or is she advocating national products?</p>
<p>The young ladies and mistresses in the city know that something is an imported product and insist on buying it, while the girls in the countryside blindly follow, only buying cheap goods, regardless of whether they are Chinese or foreign.</p>
<p>If you use the best woolen fabric from national products to make a Western suit, no matter how much you argue that it is a national product, some people will always suspect that it is a foreign product. In fact, why do you have to make a Western suit?</p>
<p>It is better to create than to imitate. Chinese manufacturers often like to copy others, so national products often lose people's trust.</p>
<p>Some people say: "Only the body of a Chinese person is purely a national product." In fact, this is not the case. Unless you have lived to this day and have absolutely never eaten a trace of foreign food, you dare to take on that statement.</p>
<p>Someone surveyed a friend: in elementary school, national products accounted for five-tenths of the whole body, in middle school, two-tenths, and when he entered university, national products were completely abandoned. This is a manifestation of the progress of school age and the psychology of worshiping foreign things.</p>
<p>Now, the love letters written by young people seem to be backward if they are not written with Parker or Conklin pens on thick, good quality paper. Thus, in a few "brother" and "sister" calls, the leakage of money is alarmingly high. However, this bad habit can be cured as long as either party expresses to the other, "If you don't use national product paper for correspondence, I won't reply," to blackmail them.</p>
<h3>Random Notes from the Cloth and Vegetable Studio</h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>Testing</p>
<p>Nine out of ten people who run around in society smoke cigarettes. If you shake your head and say you don't smoke, that is as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns, absolutely unique. Fortunately, now national product cigarettes are emerging like bamboo shoots after a spring rain, enough to meet the corresponding demand. If we completely smoke imported products, the outflow of money is more harmful than anything else!</p>
<p>Our Mr. Li, with his handsome suit and fluent English, is truly a perfect modern youth. The cigarettes he smokes are of course also the most expensive imported products. When he goes to other places and people offer him cigarettes, he takes a few puffs and always looks at the brand printed on the cigarette. If it is an imported product, regardless of the quality of the cigarette, he smokes it all the way to the end. If it is a Chinese product, whether it is Bai Jin Long or Mei Li brand, he always frowns and says, "Dry! Dry! The taste is not good." Then he throws it into the spittoon. People don't dare to criticize him in person, but behind his back, they always mock him for being enslaved, only valuing the appearance of smoking cigarettes, not seeking the substance.</p>
<p>One day, several of his friends selected several kinds of high-quality cigarettes and erased all the brands, with imported products and national products each accounting for half. They said to Mr. Li, "You are used to smoking high-quality cigarettes; you also worship foreign goods. Here are several kinds of cigarettes. Please take a few puffs of each kind. Identify which one has excellent texture, cigarette aroma, and mellowness; which one has a dry and strong character and is not hygienic." He repeatedly said, "Good! Good! There is no reason why I can't identify them!" He first squinted at the cigarette shreds of each cigarette for a while; then he took a puff and said, "This is a national product, the taste is dry and strong; this is also similar to the former." Finally, he picked up one, and while smoking it, he said: This is not a "Chelik" (a type of imported cigarette), it must be a "Bai Xibao." Everyone checked it for a while, and it turned out that what he praised was the national product Bai Jin Long. What he vilified was the imported product that he usually smoked. So everyone clapped their hands, and Mr. Li couldn't even open his mouth. Fortunately, he followed good advice and never smoked imported cigarettes again.</p>
<p>From this test, we know that many national products are not inferior, but because people distrust them, their sales are poor, and therefore they fail. Therefore, promoting national products depends on the efforts of entrepreneurs on the one hand, and the support of the public on the other.</p>
<p>I used to write a song to persuade people to quit smoking cigarettes, it might as well be written below:</p>
<p>If you don't block the trickle, it will become a river. Don't say the number is small, little by little it accumulates. A cigarette, no different from a poisoned spear, sucks my blood, increases my illness. Quit if you can quit, don't procrastinate!</p>
<p>The old man in the national product cigarette company will definitely not agree when he sees it, saying: "Your persuasion to quit smoking cigarettes is inevitably related to our business." So I wrote another song to persuade people to smoke national product cigarettes below:</p>
<p>With a cigarette in your mouth, stride forward. Full of energy; majestic. People praise you for being so spirited? You've been smoking national product cigarettes for a long time.</p>
<p>Literati write slowly, cigarettes help writing ideas. Workers are tired and may rest, cigarettes soothe their limbs. I advise you not to smoke foreign goods, remember when foreign warships bombarded us.</p>
<p>Okay, the song above, and the many words before, can be considered to have tried our best to promote national products. However, I think that with cigarettes, smoking less is better than smoking more; smoking less is better than not smoking. If you must smoke, I still advise you to smoke two national product cigarettes rather than one imported product cigarette.</p>
<h3>Isn't it Great to Write National Product Novels</h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>This is a strange party because there are more than a dozen guests sitting there, but there are all kinds of people. The wine is half drunk, and there is neither finger-guessing nor prostitution. The new-style host and guests insist on doing the old-fashioned drinking games.</p>
<p>The game master first opened his mouth and said, "My drinking game is to ask everyone to say what they do according to their own identity, and end with the four words 'Isn't it great,' and also implicitly promote the meaning of national products. Those who are good will be accompanied by a drink, and those who are not suitable will be fined three big whites."</p>
<p>There was a soldier in the seat, he was the most impatient, he stood up and said: Good! Good! Let me say it first:</p>
<p>"Practice the skills of flying over eaves and walking on walls, organize a broadsword team, kill the people of our own country, isn't it great!"</p>
<p>Everyone listened and laughed, saying "Should be punished, you kill the people of your own country, counting as promoting national products, isn't that internal strife after the country was established, wouldn't it become a national product exhibition? Punishment! Punishment!"</p>
<p>Then a dandy said:</p>
<p>"Drink Shaoxing wine, play with Yangzhou girls, dance the Eight Yi Dance, isn't it great!"</p>
<p>The game master commented: "Drinking wine and whoring, promoting national products, is still justified, may I ask how to dance the Eight Yi Dance? Who is the opponent? Obviously, it is a complete lie, should be punished, should be punished."</p>
<p>A student said:</p>
<p>"Read Chinese books, write Chinese characters, write Chinese articles, study Chinese academics, isn't it great!"</p>
<p>Everyone commented again: "On the surface, this is correct, but academics are not limited to Chinese and Western, and do not divide boundaries, gathering the strengths of others to supplement one's own weaknesses, that is the right reason. Building a car behind closed doors is inevitably out of step with the times, and wine should also be fined."</p>
<p>Then a proud and smiling merchant said:</p>
<p>"Sell Chinese goods, earn Chinese money, isn't it great!"</p>
<p>Everyone nodded, saying that he was very conscientious. However, the student was not convinced, stood up and said, "He earns Chinese money, but he has already done it. It's unreliable to say that he sells Chinese goods, don't you want to change the brand and pretend to be fake goods?" The merchant blushed when he heard his words.</p>
<p>Then there were politicians, teachers, religious figures, workers, and reporters, all said some ordinary things, some were good, and some were fined for drinking. Finally, it was the turn of the rustic old man from the countryside, he was unwilling to say it, everyone forced him, had to stand up and said:</p>
<p>"Cultivate the land myself, weave cloth myself, what I eat and wear are all national products, isn't it great!"</p>
<p>Everyone listened and applauded, shouting good! good! The people who really promote national products are only you countrymen!</p>
<h3>A Few Hundred Foreign Dollars for One Purchase</h3>

Ah Feng wants hairpins and jewelry. You buy Qing Shui crepe. The nanny buys carpets. Calculate the bill and pay the foreign dollars. Five hundred and three thousand. You say you bought a little.

<h3>Down with Myopia</h3>
<p>— Lao She</p>
<p>Humans are probably degenerating. Yao, Shun, Yu, and Tang all did not wear glasses, but I have both myopia and astigmatism. Without glasses, the universe is blurry, and the beauty of curves loses its beauty! Some Parisian women shave off their real eyebrows and draw another pair, because their natural eyebrows are not entirely to their liking. I am not a woman and dare not shave my eyebrows and redraw them, so I will not study the eyebrow drawing problem in detail. But whenever I mention glasses, I can't help but be pessimistic! Primitive people drilled wood to make fire, and I have never heard of them drilling their fingers by mistake, but modern myopic people often lock their noses together when locking doors. Humans are probably degenerating.</p>
<p>Myopia is not a minor problem. Its relationship to economics is that when you are short of money, the earpiece or nose bridge suddenly breaks. Tying it with hemp rope is a great eyesore. Going to the company to get it fixed is a cash transaction that is difficult to fulfill. Holding the glasses with both hands all day long means you can't do anything else. If you simply don't wear them, you will be dizzy. What should you do? It may even lead to suicide!</p>
<p>My friend Mr. Wang felt the need to get married, so he went to find a wife himself. There was a girl as beautiful as a flower, and he succeeded at first sight. When he married her and brought her home, he found that there were many pockmarks on her face. He was annoyed and hated, so Mr. Wang jumped off a building and died. He was also myopic!</p>
<p>My friend Mr. Li has a lot of money and a wide circle of acquaintances. He wears tortoiseshell nose pads and is a standard handsome man. On the wedding night, he took off his glasses, and his eyes were like dead fish, big and useless, scattered and dull. The next day, his wife brought up divorce. Mr. Li went to the mountains to become a monk. My friend Mr. Zhang mistakenly kissed his sister-in-law, also a victim of myopia.</p>
<p>Things like this are difficult to describe in detail. In short, myopia should be overthrown, and glasses are a curse of modern civilization. For the sake of the present, work that harms the eyes, such as reading books, writing small characters, engraving characters, embroidering, and watching movies, should be prohibited. So that people will have no myopia, and the world will be at peace.</p>
<h3>Tang Xianzu and His The Return of the Soul</h3>
<p>— He Ru</p>
<p>Tang Xianzu was the first great legendary playwright of the Ming Dynasty, and he was also good at writing poetry and classical prose. Someone advised him to give lectures, and he said, "What you gentlemen talk about is nature, what I talk about is emotion." He took Song Lian as the standard for writing essays and criticized the writings of Li Mengyang and Wang Shizhen as false styles. He also once told people: "With the consumption of the imperial examination, and the restraint of moralism, I can't devote myself to the matter of literary composition and rhythm." It seems that he deeply regretted it. It can be seen that he held a dissatisfied or rebellious attitude towards the false moralists, pseudo-classicists, and the eight-legged essays that scholars must practice, which were the most popular at the time. He loved Yuan Dynasty dramas and collected no less than a thousand copies. He could recite the best parts of each book, so it turns out that this talented legendary playwright also came from hard work. The legendary works include the Four Dreams of Yuming Hall, and The Return of the Soul is one of the Four Dreams, and is especially famous. The miscellaneous drama is The Romance of the Western Chamber, the legendary drama is The Return of the Soul, and the novel is Dream of the Red Chamber. These are all considered masterpieces in Chinese literature describing talented scholars and beautiful women.</p>
<p>The Return of the Soul is also called Peony Pavilion. It uses Liu Mengmei and Du Liniang, one man and one woman, as the protagonists, and writes about the tragicomedy of their life-and-death love. Liu Chunqing changed his name to Mengmei because he dreamed one day that there was a beautiful woman calling him under a plum tree in the garden. Du Liniang was the daughter of Du Bao, the prefect of Nanan. One spring day, she visited the garden and saw hundreds of flowers blooming and many birds chirping, and she could not help but be moved by the emotion of spring, and fell asleep from exhaustion. She dreamed of a scholar, playing with willow branches, coming to the Peony Pavilion, in front of the peony railing, and seducing her with clever words. Then the dream broke and the person died, and everything was illusory. But Liniang's feelings of sadness for spring could not be restrained. The next day, she went to the garden alone again, chasing after the traces of the dream. She only saw a plum tree. Because she thought that after death, she would like to be buried under this tree, she could not help but weep. From then on, she meditated day and night, her appearance was haggard, she wrote a portrait and wrote a poem to express her thoughts, with the line "In the future, I will be near the moon palace, not by the plum tree but by the willow tree." When she was dying, she left a will that she must be buried under the plum tree in the back garden. And she hid her self-portrait at the bottom of the Taihu stone in the courtyard. It happened that at this time Du Bao was promoted to Pacification Commissioner and transferred to Yangzhou. Later, Liu Mengmei passed by Nanan on the way to take the exam, and fell ill in the wind and snow. Fortunately, Chen Zuiliang, an old scholar who stayed behind at the Du prefect's house, caught a glimpse and helped him. He recovered from his illness in the Plum Blossom Temple where Liniang was enshrined. One day, Liu Sheng's illness slightly improved, and he went to the back garden to play. He accidentally found a small box hidden in the stone of the mountain, containing a portrait of a beautiful woman, and took it back to enshrine it. Later, Liniang's ghost appeared and met him, and swore to be husband and wife. He opened Liniang's coffin, Liniang was resurrected, and the two lived together. They planned to set off for Yangzhou to obtain the family's permission to get married. Mengmei first went to Beijing to take the exam. He encountered a military chaos, and the Jin Dynasty army went south, using the local bandit Li Quan to disturb Jianghuai. Du Pacification Commissioner was in charge of defense. After the chaos was quelled, Mengmei had already become the top scholar, and took Liniang to meet her parents. The whole play ends in this unexpected encounter.</p>
<p>It is said that this play was first performed in the Yuming Hall, but no one appreciated its merits. So the author has a poem in reply to a friend on the Qixi Festival saying:</p>
<p>In the Yuming Hall, the spring green screen is opened, and the new words are sung in Peony Pavilion.</p>
<p>Heartbroken, I clap my hands but no one understands, I pinch my sandalwood marks to teach the young actors.</p>
<p>It was not until Wang Xiangguo Xijue of Loujiang asked his family to perform it that he praised it. And he said: "Old people like me have been saddened by this song recently." From then on, Peony Pavilion became popular in the world. There was also a woman from Loujiang, Yu Erniang, who loved its lyrics so much that she died heartbroken. So the author has a poem crying for the woman from Loujiang:</p>
<p>The painted candle shakes the golden pavilion, and the pearl weeps in the embroidered window.</p>
<p>How can I hurt this song, only in Loujiang!</p>
<p>It is said that Shang Xiaoling, a female actor from Hangzhou, was known for her skills and artistry, and was especially good at The Return of the Soul. Because she was brokenhearted, she became depressed and ill. Every time she played Du Liniang's dream-seeking and mourning scenes, it seemed as if she had personally experienced it. She was soft and sad, and her face was full of tears. She finally died of suffocation while singing a heartbreaking sentence in the dream-seeking scene. There was also a woman from Neijiang who prided herself on her talent and beauty. After reading The Return of the Soul, she wanted to marry Tang Xianzu. Tang declined because he was old. One day, Tang was entertaining guests in West Lake. This woman sought to visit him. Sure enough, he was an old man, and she could not help but be disappointed and drowned herself. There was also Jin Fengdian, a female historian from Yangzhou, who sent a letter to Tang, wishing to be the wife of a talented scholar. She died of unrequited love because the reply came late, and her will was to be buried with a copy of The Return of the Soul. Later, Tang expressed his gratitude to his confidante and buried her, and stayed at her tomb for more than a month before leaving. Furthermore, Feng Xiaoqing, a woman from West Lake, has a poem reading Peony Pavilion saying:</p>
<p>The cold rain and secluded window cannot be heard, I pick up the lamp and leisurely watch Peony Pavilion.</p>
<p>There are also fools in the world like me, why is it only Xiaoqing who is sad!</p>
<p>It can be seen that once this play flowed, it bewitched many infatuated women. For a long time, the desires of men and women, which were suppressed by the etiquette, were just that there was no way to vent. Once someone used deep feelings, dreams could satisfy wishes, and death could return to life and be resurrected, and specifically and objectively expressed it in the form of opera, it was enough to make ordinary infatuated readers and audiences, especially wronged women, who usually suffered from suppression, and the spiritual harm, sad and painful emotions accumulated in the depths of their inner life, would be released and vented on the surface of consciousness in this moment of absolutely free creative life, that is, the moment of artistic pleasure, and produce the pleasure of tragedy. If you believe in the purification effect of tragedy said in the Poetics of the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle, and the treatment of madness said by modern European psychoanalysts in venting spiritual harm in the subconscious, The Return of the Soul was able to cause a sensation for a while when it first came out, and bewitch ordinary young men and women, naturally there are some reasons to say, not to mention that talented scholars and beautiful women were originally the ideal men and women of the ruling class at that time. The Return of the Soul describes the love, life and death, dreams, and illusions of talented scholars and beautiful women, and arbitrarily arranges them, making up for the impossible shortcomings in the world. It is precisely the fantasy and pursuit of the ruling class who enjoy the possible happiness in the world. Therefore, once The Return of the Soul came out, it was passed down from household to household, almost reducing the price of The Romance of the Western Chamber. Although some people criticized it for not conforming to the music score and arbitrarily using rhyme, it did not become a burden to its fame. As for the exquisite lyrics and rich talent, they were originally needed by the ruling class at that time, because only such noble opera literature was compatible with their superior life and considerable education. This is also the reason why The Return of the Soul was popular for a while.</p>
<h3>The Old Farmer</h3>
<p>— Li Huiying</p>
<p>I never imagined encountering an old farmer I knew on the streets of Jilin.</p>
<p>Five years ago, we lived in the same village. His family numbered over a dozen, with sons, daughters, daughters-in-law, and grandchildren—everything one could want. They farmed ten *xiang* of land belonging to the Yang family, which was enough to keep them fed. Though life was difficult then, through years of tireless labor, the family never went hungry.</p>
<p>Yes, seeing him on the streets of Jilin was unexpected, and it came with a story. Five years ago, his guiding principle for educating his children was, "Don't go to the two cities"—Jilin in the east, Changchun in the west. Every year, his family produced dozens of *shi* of grain. At most, they would take it to the Chaluhe market, about thirty *li* away, to sell it. He refused to let them do like others and take it to the city. He would rather sell it for less than do that. He feared people would pick up bad habits in the city. He heard the city was a vast pitfall that easily corrupted people. He didn't just restrict his family from going to the city; he set an example himself, staying in the village year after year.</p>
<p>But now he had indeed come to the city, and as a beggar, no less. This not only surprised me but shocked me even further. I was astonished at how quickly his life had changed.</p>
<p>He persistently begged me for money, which allowed me to recognize him. I asked him:</p>
<p>"Uncle Ma (I addressed him as I always had), why aren't you farming in the village anymore?"</p>
<p>Since we recognized each other, he didn't stand on ceremony. He replied:</p>
<p>"Ah! It's a long story!"</p>
<p>From that sigh, I could see the deep wrinkles on his face become more pronounced, and in his dry, dim old eyes, a few bright tear-like droplets seemed to appear. Then, he continued:</p>
<p>"Alas! These days, not only can people like me, whose families are ruined and scattered, not go back to the village to farm, but if you ask those who still have homes and land, they wouldn't say that either. They would say, since there's a bowl of thin gruel to drink in the city, who would want to go back to the village to farm?"</p>
<p>He said his family was ruined and scattered? So, I asked him:</p>
<p>"What happened, Uncle? Your family?"</p>
<p>"The family? Don't you know? Last year, Japanese planes dropped bombs and destroyed everything. People were killed, things were burned to the ground. Only this old, useless wretch escaped."</p>
<p>Of course, I knew about such things. It was another act of Japanese benevolence—benevolence towards him, no, benevolence towards so many people. People's lives had been hard enough these past few years, and now even the means to eat amidst hardship had been taken away. Japanese imperialism was pushing them towards the brink of death. I asked him the second part of my question, finding it somewhat astonishing that the words "don't want to go back to the village to farm" came from a farmer's mouth:</p>
<p>"You said since there's a bowl of thin gruel to drink in the city, you don't want to go back to the village to farm. Why is that?"</p>
<p>"Ah!" He sighed again, his heart seemingly filled with unspeakable sorrow. "Let me tell you, planting grain in the ground costs money and labor. Plowing and tilling take nearly everything. The crops grow well, but then fighting breaks out. The Japanese soldiers say they're fighting bandits; the bandits say they're the Volunteer Army fighting the Japanese soldiers. After the fighting, it's the villagers who suffer. The crops and houses are all destroyed. There's no place to live, nothing to eat, just waiting to starve to death. Even you wouldn't want to go back to the village to do that kind of thing! I heard that this year, over two thousand *xiang* of land in the southern wilderness have been left uncultivated!"</p>
<p>As he finished speaking, he looked both regretful and indignant. I nodded, understanding what he had suffered. But I wondered, is the "bowl of thin gruel" in the city really easy to come by? There are countless more beggars on the streets than before. How could the city be a place to settle down!</p>
<p>As I was about to ask him something else, a policeman with a sword at his side emerged from a side street, scaring him into hurrying away without even asking me for money. A kind and simple farmer from the countryside, forced by hardship to become familiar with the rules of the city—he must have suffered at the hands of the police.</p>
<h3>Little Satire</h3>
<p>— By Sologub, Translated by Shi Heng</p>
<p>(2) Equality</p>
<p>A big fish caught a small fish and wanted to devour it.</p>
<p>The small fish cried out: "This is unfair! I also want to live. All fish are equal before the law."</p>
<p>The big fish replied: "What's the matter? I don't want to discuss whether we are equal, but if you don't want me to eat you, then if you can, please swallow me! Swallow me, don't be afraid, I won't resist."</p>
<p>The small fish opened its mouth, trying to swallow the big fish, but finally sighed and said: "You're right. Swallow us then."</p>
<h3>Two Brothers (44)</h3>
<p>— By Maupassant, Translated by Li Weike</p>
<p>Ah, regret! Regret! At the moment she lost her virginity, she must have regretted it, but not afterward. True, she had cried for her mistake, but slowly, she had almost forgotten it. Don't all women have this amazing ability to forget, so that after a few years, they almost forget the men who had kissed their lips and their whole bodies? A kiss strikes like lightning, love disappears like a storm, and then, life returns to tranquility like the sky, and then the same old routine begins again. Who remembers a cloud?</p>
<p>Pierre could no longer stay in his room. This house, his father's house, was simply crushing him. He felt the roof pressing down on his head, the walls suffocating him. Because he was very thirsty, he lit a candle and thought of going to the kitchen to drink a glass of cool water by the sand filter.</p>
<p>He ran down two flights of stairs. Then, as he came up with a full bottle of cool water, she sat in her nightgown on a well-ventilated step of the stairs. Without a glass, he brought the bottle to his mouth and drank greedily, like a panting runner. When he stood still, the silence in the house startled him. Then, one by one, he distinguished the smallest sounds in the house. The first thing he heard was the clock in the dining room, and he felt the ticking growing louder second by second. Then he heard a snore, an old man's snore, short, laborious, and harsh, undoubtedly his father's snore. Then he was tormented by a sudden thought: that the two people snoring in this house, father and son, were completely unrelated! No relationship connected them, not even the slightest relationship, and they didn't know it! They talked intimately, they embraced, they felt joy or emotion together about the same things, as if the same blood flowed through their veins. In fact, the relationship between two people born at the poles of the earth could not be more distant than that between this father and this son, because a lie had grown on them, so they thought they loved each other. It was this lie that caused them to feel paternal love and filial piety, a lie that could not be exposed, and that no one but he, the real son, would ever know.</p>
<p>However, however, what if he was wrong? How did he know this? Ah! If there was a similarity between his father and Jean, a mysterious similarity of the kind that indicates the entire lineage from great-grandfather to great-grandson is directly transmitted from the same kiss, that would be good. In the eyes of him, the doctor, even the slightest similarity could be seen: the shape of the cheekbones, the curve of the nose, the distance between the eyes, the style of the teeth and hair, and even more subtle things like a gesture, a habit, a posture, an inherited taste, or some special characteristic that could be seen by an experienced eye.</p>

<h3>Finance: Gold Speculation Suffers Another Setback; Exchange Rates - US Dollar - Sudden Rise: Even Slightest Movements are Immediately Visible; Fell Seventeen Yuan in Half a Day; Fluctuations Still Moderate</h3>
<p>The gold market experienced a decline yesterday. Due to the rise in the US official gold purchase price of nine cents, reaching $33.85, exchange rates and the US dollar saw a sharp increase. The forward silver price on the Gold Exchange also rose by 102 to 108 pounds. London gold rose by 1 shilling and 10.5 pence, US cotton rose by 7 pounds, US wheat rose by 6.25, and stock prices showed minor fluctuations. News reports were chaotic, seemingly based on a New York dispatch from the 27th, which appeared outdated and didn't have much impact. The initial opening of the bullion market retreated to within ten yuan, then rose and fell, showing much struggle. After the opening, with banks releasing gold and the local market becoming firm, Sassoon &amp; Co. also made sales. The situation in the market then showed an oversupply, leading to a decline in downstream prices. Later, with the Jewish merchant Qiao Zhifu seeking to settle, failing to obtain $34.50 for March US dollars, and silver companies also contributing, the exchange market turned calm again, and gold prices also rebounded. The final situation hovered, lacking special changes. The fluctuations in half a day were still narrow, and the market was mediocre. Major players showed different supply and demand. Yuefeng Yong and other firms first sold and then bought, and the Western firm Kelly also contributed, so the prices returned after falling. The pure gold price was 1095 yuan, and traders were waiting to see. Only brokers within the market traded among themselves. The market situation is recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was 707.7 yuan, a decrease of 13.7 yuan compared to the previous close. The price of goods opened at the same price. The morning opening of the exchange market saw a selling price for near-term pound sterling at 1 shilling 3 pence and 3125 points, and US dollars at 33.4375 yuan. Bingxing and Changsheng Yong contributed bars. From 7.1 yuan, it rose to 8.3 yuan. Soon, $33.4375 for March US dollars was difficult to sell. Shunli, Daxing Yong, Yuanxing Yong, Tongtaichang, Yuanmao, etc., jointly sold bars. Zhengjin sold February US dollars at 25, retreating to 5.1 yuan. Fuchang, Tongtaichang, and Qianchangxiang contributed bars, pulling up by one yuan. But with prior knowledge that HSBC's listing showed pound sterling flat and US dollar up by 75, Zhengjin again sold January US dollars at 625. Zhifeng Yong, Fuyu Hengyu, Yidayong, Hongli, Dadecheng, Zhaofengchang, Yuanxing Yong, etc., jointly sold bars, falling to 3.5 yuan. Later, Qiao Zhifu sought to settle half a yuan for March, and silver companies contributed 34 yuan for January. Hengyu, Zhifeng Yong, Ruikang, Qianchangxiang, and Shunli all advanced, gradually rising to outside of five yuan. At this point, with Hongxing, Ruikang, Yidayong, etc., supplying bars, the situation fluctuated. When Zhengjin fixed $33.4375 for March, Hengyu and Zhengchang advanced again, reaching 6.2 yuan. Later, because Jiaotong sold half a yuan for March to Zhejiang, Zhifeng Yong, Dadecheng, and the Dalian gang all sold, falling to 4.1 yuan. Yuanxing Yong vigorously bought in, essentially covering Yuefeng Yong's buying. Zhengjin also bought $33.4375 for March twice, and Hengyu and Hengxing also purchased, rising again to 5.8 yuan. Fuchang, Yidayong, and Yuanmaoyong sold, for 4.2 yuan. The noon close was 704.3 yuan, with goods bid at 4.7 yuan. After the closing, with the Western firm Laolai advancing bars, Shengda and Shunli, etc., contributed bars, rising to outside of five yuan. Bingxing and Hengtailai sold, retreating to within 4.5 yuan. Finally, it was flat again. The highest for half a day was 708.3 yuan, and the lowest was 703.5 yuan, a difference of only 4.8 yuan. As a result, it fell 17.1 yuan compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The listed price rose by 75, with HSBC listing US dollars at 33.125 yuan, corresponding to a gold price of over 724 yuan. Based on the closing price, this represents a premium of about 20 yuan. There isn't much difference compared to the previous close. This month's registered price is 718 yuan, December's is 710 yuan, and January's is 704 yuan. The morning supplemental water was 718 yuan, and the pure gold price was 1095 yuan. The situation in the market was relatively chaotic, with little activity among the industry. Only brokers traded between themselves for over 2,000 taels, falling from 1097 yuan to 1092 yuan, and finally to 1090 yuan. It seemed that industry players were contributing. Currently, there are 1,225 bars remaining for this month, and 4,508 bars for December.</p>
<p>Market trading was still active. In summary, Changsheng Yong, Hengyu, Bingxing, Dafayong, Dakang, Yuanmao, Shenkang, Fuyuyi Fengyong, Futaiheng, Fuchang, Shunli, etc., all bought, while Dadecheng, Dachangxiang, Hengtai, Ruixing, Yuanchun, Zhifeng Yong, Yongfeng Zhaofengchang, Hengchangyong, Tongtaichang, etc., were primarily sellers. Daxing Yong and Ruikang first advanced and then exited, and Yuanxing Yong and Dadecheng first exited and then advanced. The Dalian gang and Wanxing jointly traded around 2,900 bars, taking in over one hundred bars. Shunli jointly traded over 2,400 bars, taking in over two hundred bars. Guangbang Hengxing took in over one hundred bars but sold a small number. Shengda took in over one hundred bars. A total of 20,804 bars are planned for January.</p>

After the opening, due to banks selling, the HSBC listing was announced, showing the pound sterling flat and the US dollar up by 75. The Indian and French rates fell, and the Singapore, Hong Kong, German, etc., rates remained unchanged. The process was loose and oversupplied. Sassoon &amp; Co. also sold.

<h3>Shanghai Financial Market Affected by the Fujian Incident; Outstanding Debts Urgently Collected… Foreign Exchange Interest Rates Gradually Rise</h3>
<p>Although the recent Fujian Incident has not had much impact on the surface of the Shanghai financial market, it is necessary to be slightly cautious as a precaution. Therefore, foreign exchange interest rates have been gradually rising, and the situation is becoming increasingly tense. According to people in the industry, it is now the end of the year, and all industries are in the process of settling their accounts. The sudden Fujian Incident has severely impacted commerce. In order to avoid risks, finance must urgently collect outstanding debts. Even long-term mortgages that have expired are being strictly settled, making the market particularly dry and hindering the development of business.</p>
<h3>Securities, November Series: Many Public Bonds Delivered; Number Four Most Frequently Receiving Goods; Financial Sector Mostly Delivering Goods</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange was the delivery date for the November series of bond futures. The number of settlements this month far exceeded the number of the previous few months, totaling 53,825,000 yuan. Among them, the number of settlements made independently by various brokers through account transfers was 38,095,000, and the number of settlements actually made at the exchange was 15,730,000. The number of transactions made by various brokers outside the exchange without auditable accounts was also considerable. On the receiving side, Number Four was the most frequent. On the delivery side, Numbers 21, 33, and 50 were the most frequent, and they mostly belonged to the financial sector. The number of other scattered settlements also amounted to several million. The reason for the particularly high number of deliveries this time was entirely due to the influence of the current situation. Those receiving goods took advantage of the low prices to buy in, which was a rare opportunity. The November futures began trading on September 28 and stopped on November 25. The period of about 60 days was full of ups and downs, and the price fluctuations were quite rapid. October 11 was the highest price in nearly two months, with the Disbandment Bond at 67.5 yuan and the Salt Tax Bond at 54 yuan. From then on, it became smaller and smaller, and the situation was quite tragic. By the time the delivery was approaching, the Disbandment Bond was at a minimum of 58 yuan and the Salt Tax Bond was at a minimum of 45.5 yuan, a difference of almost 10 yuan. The storms and real conditions during this period were mostly unfavorable to the bulls. At first, Fang Zhenwu disrupted North China, but as it was coming to an end and Huang Fu went north, the market gradually stabilized. After that, because the 22nd Year Treasury Bond was issued for 100 million yuan, the market was quite shocked. Later, because of the statement that it would not be listed on the market for bidding, people's minds were set, and the market price once rose sharply, actually finding one or two new high prices. Then, because Finance Minister Song resigned and there were rumors of issuing new Salt Tax Treasury Bonds, people's minds were already extremely empty. On November 14, the Fujian province suddenly reported a political change, and on the 21st, it actually declared independence, making it difficult to meet Hu, and Guangdong province was even more of an observer. At this point, the market price of public bonds fell sharply, and there was an unstoppable trend. During this period, thanks to Number Four's large-scale purchases, otherwise the market price would have fallen even more miserably. The future situation is still to be observed, and we should also observe how the authorities and the financial sector handle it. The total number of transactions for November, and the delivery and account transfer numbers, are listed below (unit: thousand yuan):</p>
<p>Type, Delivery Number, Account Number, Transaction Number, Total</p>
<p>18 Customs, 20, 340, 920, 1,600</p>
<p>Disbandment, 1,050, 2,190, 13,685, 16,925</p>
<p>Disbandment Bond, 875, 2,570, 45,555, 48,780</p>

<h3>November Yarn Flower: The Course of Fluctuations and Delivery Situation of Trademarked Yarn Flower</h3>
<h3>Trademarked Yarn Fell from 203.5 Yuan to 178.1 Yuan; Delivery Price 184 Yuan</h3>
<h3>Zheng Trademarked First Transaction 46.55 Yuan, Last Transaction 39.2 Yuan; Delivery Price 40.5 Yuan</h3>
<p>Trademarked yarn for November delivery, initially priced at 203.5 yuan on June 1st, coincided with U.S. President Roosevelt's implementation of an inflationary policy, leading to a rise in American cotton. Simultaneously, factories, burdened by losses and hardship, sought to maintain stability, causing market anxiety and a temporary price surge. However, with the satisfactory new cotton production and weak economic conditions impacting yarn sales, coupled with the dumping of Japanese yarn, Chinese yarn suffered a major blow, resulting in market instability. Prices dropped to a low of 179 yuan. On October 16th, the Cotton Industry Control Association was established to maintain yarn price stability. They purchased over 10,000 bales of held yarn, gradually increasing market prices. Subsequently, on November 4th, the Ministry of Industry issued an order preventing new yarn factories and customers from settling transactions. Short sellers panicked, halting trading for three days. After authorities mediated a flexible solution, trading resumed, reaching a high of 188 yuan. Unexpectedly, the situation in Fujian became severe, sales stagnated, and the market rapidly changed, triggering a steep decline. The Control Association also had no intention of taking delivery, leading to a frightening price drop that was difficult to control. This situation was unprecedented. On the final day, prices fell by 6.9 yuan, reaching a low of 178.1 yuan. As a result, 24,300 bales remained, with 16,200 bales delivered. Among them, over 8,000 bales were new yarn, and the rest were old yarn. It is said that Tongcheng Company received 5,000 bales, and the rest were received by Yongan. The goods were mainly 20-count, including "Human Clock," "Dragon Boat," and "Flower Picking" brands. The delivery price was 184 yuan. The names of the brokers on both sides of the delivery and the delivery volumes are listed separately below:</p>

<p>November Zheng Trademarked Flower also went on the market on June 1st, with a first transaction price of 46.55 yuan. Later, it slightly rose to about 47 yuan. At that time, the United States implemented inflation hedging and a plan to destroy one-fourth of the cotton fields. Therefore, people's confidence was strong, and American cotton trended higher, followed by a stabilization of domestic cotton. Unexpectedly, the new cotton production was in good condition, and on August 8th, the U.S. government estimated a rich harvest, falling from 12 cents to within the 10-cent mark. As a result, Chinese cotton was difficult to stabilize, falling from 46.5 yuan to 39.4 yuan. Later, after the new cotton entered the market, various sources were not strong, the moisture content was too high, and it rose back to 41.5 yuan. However, general cotton merchants were in a long position, absorbing the amount, holding steady, and the American and Indian cotton markets were trending downstream. Spot cotton factories needed to stop, and on the last day, there was a lack of receivers, and the last transaction suddenly fell within the 40-yuan mark, to 39.2 yuan, finding the new low since this year. As a result, 21,100 dan remained, with only 6-7,000 dan delivered. The goods were all Tongzhou flowers, and the delivery price was 40.05 yuan. The brokerage numbers and delivery amounts for both the receivers and deliverers are listed separately below.</p>

<h3>Stagnant Sales of Spot Yarn Flower on Delivery Day / May Term Yarn May Be Difficult to Trade Due to Issues /</h3>
<p>Spot cotton yarn sales are becoming increasingly sluggish, and the situation is quite weak. Because the news after the closing of the previous day's yarn was still bad, people were still panicked, and coupled with the rumors of the current situation, the market was particularly affected. It was found that the customers bought only 76 bales of spot yarn, including 56 bales from inland customers, 15 bales from Shantou customers, and 5 bales from Nanjing customers.</p>
<p>The May term flower yarn transaction should have opened for trading one day after the November delivery. Now, due to unresolved issues, the Brokers Association convened a meeting yesterday afternoon, fearing that it would be difficult to resume trading.</p>
<p>The cotton market continued to be quiet, and the atmosphere became more pessimistic. Credit is becoming tighter, and the market is not good. The arrival of Yao flower totaled 4,094 bales, and Tong flower totaled 1,301 bales. The current flower prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Shashi Flower: 37.25 yuan, Jiang Trading Company arrival, 50 pieces, warehouse delivery</p>
<p>Lu American Cotton: 43.00 yuan, Hongzhang Factory arrival, 200 pieces, delivered to factory</p>
<p>Also: 43.40 yuan, Shanghai Factory arrival, 600 pieces, also</p>
<p>Fire Machine Flower: 36.00 yuan, also, 500 bales, also</p>
<h3>Grains / Near-Term Flour Still Breaks the Three-Dollar Mark /</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, after opening in the morning, showed a trend of initial stability followed by improvement in each month. The quotation for foreign wheat was 0.23 yuan higher for Chicago and slightly lower for Canada. Therefore, after the opening price, the market once softened. The smallest price for this month was 2.28 yuan. Later, due to active replenishment by short sellers and a slight increase in receipts for the far-term December contract by a certain factory, the market recovered and improved. Compared with the initial market, the near-term price rose by more than 0.03 yuan, and the far-term price rose by 0.01 yuan. Until the afternoon opening, the situation in this month was initially firm, opening as high as 3.03 yuan, but then gradually deteriorated. Spot sales in Tianjin have decreased, and the selling price has also gradually fallen, reaching as low as 3.09 yuan yesterday. Since the Fuzhou incident, the business of the Tianjin customers has been greatly affected, and many standards have been returned. Therefore, the market has become quiet again. As a result, the near-term price still broke the three-dollar mark, only 0.0025 yuan higher than the previous day, 0.0025 yuan higher for December, 0.01 yuan higher for January-February, 0.0075 yuan higher for March, and 0.005 yuan higher for April.</p>
<h3>Futures and Spot Wheat Both Show Stability</h3>
<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market generally showed a fluctuating trend. Because trading for the current month has been suspended, trading for the far-term months was sparse on both the buying and selling sides. The December standard seemed unable to rise further beyond the three-dollar mark, because the highest spot price was also only three dollars. Factories are expected to receive foreign wheat ordered, probably in December, so the demand for standards will naturally decrease, and people's confidence cannot be maintained. As a result, December was slightly lower by 0.01 yuan, February was higher by 0.01 yuan, and there were no other changes. Very little spot wheat was traded, and the price was stable. 220 bales of Kaiyangzhou wheat were opened at 4.10 yuan, purchased by Fuxin.</p>
<h3>Middle-Level Late Rice Continues to Fall by 0.1-0.2 Yuan</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the supply continued to be strong, with 80-90 ships (over 10,000 shi) arriving from various sources. The late rice market was still sluggish. Although the customers still handled 5-6,000 bags (over 7,000 shi), due to the influence of the current situation and restrictions on transportation, people's confidence was difficult to recover. The opening quotations were lowered by several points, and the price of middle-level rice continued to depreciate by 0.1-0.2 yuan. Fortunately, the market for Changbang, Sutongbang, Nangang and other japonica rice, as well as Doyangjian, continued to be strong, and the market situation has stabilized. Only the middle-grade rice was slightly softer. The sale of Yinyuan rice for liquor making was still sluggish, and the market remained soft. Bianyuan was also mediocre.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) There were over 60 ships arriving from various sources. Various types of rice on the market continued to be sold. The market for white japonica, Yangdu, Ke Xian, and early Bo rice was stable, while white rice, Yinyuan, and埠尖略現 showed a slight softening trend.</p>
<h3>Slow Sales of Ke Xian Continue to Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Ke Xian market turned flat and soft again. The Guangbang customers' buying appetite was weak, and they only handled 85 bags of Xiangji Hong. The Minbang customers had not yet started because the market in that area had not fully stabilized, and they dared not handle shipments. However, Xiamen, after the consular corps agreed that the local person in charge would be designated as a non-garrison area, people's confidence and the market slightly stabilized. Therefore, 112 bags of Jiangxi Jiwan were tried in the market. If they could be transported smoothly after shipment, they would continue to handle shipments. Fuzhou and Quanzhou still had a strong appetite, but due to the uncertain situation, they did not start handling shipments yesterday. The inland merchants in this street turned their attention to various rice types in Hexia, only Ke Yuan was still purchased in this street. However, recently many new Bian Yuan and Yin Yuan rice have arrived in Hexia, and the price has also gradually fallen. The supply of Ke Xin rice has also surged, and the market price has followed it lower. Yesterday, this street handled 100 bags of Wuhu Ji Yuan, priced at 7.65 yuan, and 320 bags of Wuxi Ji Yuan, priced at 8.14 yuan, more than 0.15 yuan lower than the previous market. Ji Hong opened at 7 yuan, and Jiangxi Jiwan at 7.5 yuan, also nearly 0.1 yuan lower than before.</p>
<h3>Strong Factory Sales of Yellow Beans / Market Continues to Weaken by 0.04-0.05 Yuan /</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yellow bean market continued to weaken by 0.04-0.05 yuan, but sales were still present. Apart from stagnant exports, there were transactions in the inland market and on this street. Factory demand was particularly strong, with factories handling 11-12 vehicles of various beans, and the inland market and this street handling 4-5 vehicles. There were few inquiries for high-grade goods on the market, and the market trend remained soft. Factories are adopting middle-grade goods, and people's confidence is steady.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market / Medium-Grade White Sugar Short, Prices Rise /</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend remained flat. The guild's opening price for ordinary coarse white sugar was 20.1 yuan, without sale. Due to the shortage of No. 20 medium-grade white sugar, the opening price was raised to 20 yuan. The opening price for Nos. 8 and 9 Dutch red sugar was 15.65 yuan for ordinary goods and 15.9 yuan for high-grade goods. Taikoo Sugar B mark was down by 0.05 yuan, to 20.35 yuan. The opening price for Jibao local factory cotton white sugar was 18.95 yuan for No. 1, 18.75 yuan for No. 2, 18.55 yuan for No. 3, and 18.35 yuan for No. 4, 0.05 yuan lower than the previous day. The new Chaoqing slightly opened at 14.7 yuan, and old goods opened at 15 yuan for over 100 bags, also at 14.9-14.7 yuan.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods / South Gorgon Fruit Market Turns Higher /</h3>
<p>Southern pond gorgon fruit, recently, due to scarce stocks, the market has tightened and gradually risen. It was found that the previous lowest price was 52-53 yuan, and now the market price is 60 yuan, with a firm trend. There are still many stocks of pond gorgon fruit, and the market is flat. Yesterday, the market price was 18.5 yuan, without much fluctuation.</p>
<h3>Metals / American Galvanized Iron Prices Fall One After Another /</h3>
<p>American galvanized iron trading has also been affected by East galvanized iron recently, and prices have fallen one after another. The current market price is 1.47 yuan per sheet for 48 sheets, 19.5 yuan per dan for 38 sheets, 18.5 yuan for 33 sheets, and 17 yuan for 25 sheets. In recent days, there have only been sporadic transactions. Large-scale transactions are rare due to the current situation and credit conditions. Even the Yangtze customers, on whom they have always relied, are now only making small purchases. It is said that there have been many recent arrivals, and it is feared that standards will not be easy to maintain.</p>
<h3>East Goods New Lead Wire Arrives in Shanghai One After Another</h3>
<p>From the 16th to the 20th, East Goods new lead wire has been arriving continuously at various docks, such as Osaka Mitsubishi. Therefore, the prices of British and American goods in the market have been affected. The price of East goods is only 14 yuan, while the price of British and American goods is 16.0 yuan.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea / American Sales of Chinese Silk Have Become Hopeless /</h3>
<p>The Lyon raw silk market, both overt and covert, has been weak. Although the silk price has not changed much on the surface since the beginning of the week, the French exchange rate has soared, and the U.S. President's proposal for inflation has been supported by merchants, leading to a fall in gold prices and a decline in the silver market. The trade in Shanghai foreign companies and Chinese silk is calculated in silver dollars. Therefore, although the opening price of Lyon white factory silk is still 81.25 francs per kilogram, the cost in Chinese currency is only about 750 yuan per bale. Grade B is 71.25 francs, costing only 650 yuan in Chinese currency, about 10 yuan lower than the covert price.</p>
<p>Limited Shipments of Wuxi Factory Silk to Shanghai European and American companies' sales of white factory silk have almost stopped this month. Wuxi factories have rarely made shipments. As the end-of-month settlement period has arrived, the shipments of Wuxi factory silk to Shanghai have been limited. Only 35 pieces of Moon Rabbit Double Eagle and other brands have arrived in the last week.</p>
<p>The sale of rayon is becoming increasingly sluggish. Yesterday, only the thread factory and sock factory bought 11 units of Kongsheng AKE and Golden Bell brands in the spot market, with prices ranging from 168.825 yuan to 155.775 yuan net.</p>
<p>The demand for yellow and white coarse silk in India is also weak. The imbalance in the overseas silk market has reached its extreme. New York spot silk prices have plummeted repeatedly, setting new records. Although Roosevelt is now pursuing an inflationary policy, silk stocks are abundant, sales are greatly reduced, and supply exceeds demand. Moreover, the price of factory silk in New York is only 60% of the cost of each factory, resulting in excessive losses and the inability to dump silk. American sales have become hopeless. The demand for yellow and white coarse silk in India is also weak. Only 11 bales were traded yesterday, and the price remained weak.</p>
<h3>Lifeless Tea Market / Transactions Less Than 100 Cases /</h3>
<p>The Shanghai foreign company tea market, due to depleted stocks of red and green teas, is becoming increasingly weak. Negotiations by merchants have almost completely stopped in the last two days. Yesterday, only Yongshen tea warehouse sold 95 cases of Chun Ya 眉 green tea to Tongfu Foreign Company, at a price of 31 yuan. There were no transactions for other goods such as Zhen Mei and Pearl Tea.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>It Is Necessary to Rectify Names</h3>
<p>— Wei Ba</p>
<p>To scold someone as a thief or pilferer is what people greatly detest. If someone commits such an act, they will surely be furious and ready to fight. However, on a streetcar, when someone gives coins but doesn't receive a ticket, the ticket seller smiles and says, "Sir, I'm sorry!" The passenger understands, returns a smile, and the coins end up in the ticket seller's pocket. This is not called "stealing," but "skimming oil."</p>
<p>There are many ways to skim oil! From the treasury manager to the old maid employed in a household, everywhere there is oil, it can be skimmed. The term is elegant and can be spoken by gentlemen.</p>
<p>Calling "stealing" "petty theft" or "pilfering" is not well received. But changing the name to "skimming oil" allows people to say it without shame in public. Isn't this a great achievement?</p>
<p>Wei Basheng said: "Is it not necessary to rectify names? Is it not necessary to rectify names?"</p>
<p>Confucius said, "If names be not correct, language is not in accordance with the truth of things. If language be not in accordance with the truth of things, affairs cannot be carried on to success. If affairs cannot be carried on to success, proprieties and music do not flourish. If proprieties and music do not flourish, punishments will not be properly awarded. If punishments be not properly awarded, the people do not know how to move hand or foot." He revised the "Spring and Autumn Annals" so that rebellious ministers and villainous sons were afraid. This was a matter that had "existed since ancient times," but it is being applied even more widely today!</p>
<p>To discredit someone today, one must list "ten major crimes" to undoubtedly make oneself a "perfect old man." In this way, one can feel at ease, sleep soundly at night, and have no shame during the day.</p>
<p>All of these are applications of "rectifying names" that align with Confucius's "profound meaning," which is greatly beneficial. Examples include calling a lost battle "shortening the battle line" and calling non-resistance "luring the enemy deep." The reader can infer more examples.</p>
<h3>Contradiction</h3>
<p>— Shuxian</p>
<p>At six o'clock in the morning, she, among a group of workers with unfamiliar faces, was swallowed by the iron gate, which looked like a gaping bloody mouth. She was now a female worker inspecting yarn in the inspection room. This brand-new start to her life was the result of her third uncle's treating the "overseer" to a meal last Saturday. Her job was to take the yarn twists spun by the female workers in the spinning room and inspect them for "any flaws." If flaws were found, the spinning worker would have their wages docked. There were specific regulations for docking wages for various flaws.</p>
<p>There were six of them, sitting around an inspection table. Each person had a burlap sack to their right, filled with spun yarn twists. Yinmei randomly took the first yarn twist from the sack, placed it on the inspection frame, lowered her head, and slowly counted the number of yarn strands and scrutinized the various flaws inside. Whenever she found one, she would record it on the fine list with a pencil.</p>
<p>...0.1 yuan...0.5 yuan...0.05 yuan. The first yarn twist was inspected. Adding up the total amount of the various fines, she arrived at 2.8 yuan. She was so shocked that she almost dropped her pencil. She suspected that she had calculated it wrong, so she calculated it again, but it was still 2.8 yuan, which really puzzled her. She thought, "Maybe the spinning worker's wages are very high, so being fined two or three yuan doesn't matter much!" Driven by curiosity, she finally mustered the courage to gently ask the person sitting to her left.</p>
<p>"How much money can a spinning worker earn each day?"</p>
<p>"0.3-0.4 yuan."</p>
<p>This simple answer almost made her shout. She calculated in her head, "0.3-0.4 yuan a day, 3-4 yuan in ten days. If I'm fined 2.8 yuan two or three times in half a month, not only will those ten days of work be for nothing, but I'll also have to bring money from home to compensate! What if I were a spinning worker?" Holding the pencil, she just stared blankly, thinking, when suddenly, "slap!" someone slapped her on the back! All her thoughts were scattered by this unexpected blow! She quickly turned around and saw the foreman, wearing a factory uniform, standing straight behind her, staring at her with his glowing eyes. Her heart skipped a beat. She quickly turned back around and hastily wrote a "2" in the Yuan column of the fine list, followed by the decimal point "8" in Arabic numerals. Her hand trembled violently.</p>
<p>She secretly looked at the other inspection workers sitting next to her, who seemed to be doing fine, writing many different numbers such as "2 yuan, 3 yuan, 3.6 yuan..." in the Yuan column of their fine lists. She really doubted whether their consciences were made of "ink."</p>
<p>Suffering the condemnation of her conscience, the only thing Yinmei could do was to be more careless in her inspections. However, in less than three days, she was discovered by the cunning foreman. Fortunately, due to the pleading of all the inspection workers, the foreman spared her because of the face of one of the prettiest female workers, only fining her two yuan.</p>
<p>She felt that she did not have the courage to continue working for another week. She felt that her current job as a worker was even more passively used to fine the wages of other workers. She absolutely did not want to engage in this kind of behavior of selling out her own kind to beg for food. But when she thought about how others were already wearing woolen sweaters, while she was still wearing a torn jacket, and how her toes would be showing through her shoes in another week, and how to arrange her meals at the restaurant? And where would she go to eat in the future? ...etc., these many questions made her unable to resolve them. As such, her heart was filled with "?" symbols all day long, as if it were a battlefield.</p>
<p>It was the tenth evening since Yinmei had entered the yarn factory. It was raining heavily, and the terrible wind was howling madly. She and three other inspection workers were going home together after work, leaning close to each other, and moving forward step by step. When they had just reached the wooden bridge over a small creek, they were blocked by three or four burly men wearing short blue cloth shirts and several female yarn factory workers carrying lunch boxes in their hands.</p>
<p>"F*** your mother! Where are you running off to?" The harsh Jiangbei accent startled them all at the same time.</p>
<p>"These are all the rotten s***s from our factory's inspection room. Let's give them a beating!" The several women shouted in unison.</p>
<p>The three or four burly men grabbed one of them at random, like catching chickens.</p>
<p>"Slap!" Yinmei was struck in the face. One side of her face felt like it was on fire.</p>
<p>"We can talk things over, there's no need to resort to violence!" Yinmei retorted proudly.</p>
<p>"F*** your mother! Don't you understand? You fined so much of my sister's money in the factory! She only makes nine yuan a month, and you fined it all away!"</p>
<p>"Bang!" "Bang!" Then there were two more blows to her waist.</p>
<p>"No! You're wrong! It's not that we want to fine you, and I..." Yinmei tried to defend herself.</p>
<p>"Don't talk! Do you have the right to speak?"</p>
<p>"Bang," "Bang"!</p>
<p>"Slap," "Slap"!</p>
<p>They were all shouting wildly earlier, but after shouting, they only made terrible screams. The sounds of their throats gradually became hoarse! Then only their rapid breathing and feeble groans could be heard.</p>
<p>"Bang bang"! "Bang bang"! The four of them were kicked into the muddy water of the small creek. The shadows of the men and female workers quietly disappeared in the darkness of the storm!</p>
<h3>The Heart of Sorrow</h3>
<p>— Wildfire</p>
<p>For a month now, I have been as if my soul has wandered away: during the day, my heart is uneasy, unable to sit or walk still. When I try to read, the words on the page seem like sharp arrows, piercing my chest mercilessly, forcing me to put the book down. When I pick up a pen, my heart becomes even more flustered; what should I write? I can't write a single word. At night, it's the same uneasiness, perhaps even more frantic, either suffering from insomnia as soon as I lie down or staring blankly at the skylight until dawn. The only slightly more comfortable thing to do is to go to the street and chat with friends. However, afterwards, inevitably, the frantic heart is further weighed down by an attack of "emptiness," so I also fear "this."</p>
<p>It was the late night of the fourteenth when I went to a fellow villager's home in the desolate and bleak northern part of Shanghai to collect money, clutching my father's letter. Under the sparse and dim electric lights, amidst the wild barking of dogs, I groped and searched, circling around several times before finally finding the place, only to be met with disappointment. Turning back, I sat on the edge of the bed and took out my father's letter again. Through teary eyes, I stared at these sentences: "When will you return? Although I long for it, I dare not urge you!" At the end, he added: "Return as soon as possible to ease my longing!" That night, I didn't close my eyes for even a moment, and I began to feel the sorrow in my heart! When I embarked on my journey again this year in the first lunar month, my father, shedding old tears, said to me: "I won't use my illness and old age to force you to stay at home and ruin your beautiful dreams! If, if... just write a letter to let you know, you don't need to come back, and you probably won't come back anyway! It's so far, and the travel expenses are so high!" At that time, I didn't know how to respond, only using tears as my representative. Holding the letter, I thought about everything in the past... the eternal farewell in spring, my father's life, my injuries of the past few years.</p>
<p>On the evening of the eighteenth, news arrived from home... Father had died on the fourteenth, leaving this world forever! But it was said that "the coffin should be sealed and prepared for burial after you return," and if it was difficult to return immediately, it was necessary to "keep the coffin in the left side of the hall, awaiting your return for the funeral." The dying father was different from the son who bid farewell in spring.</p>
<p>I cannot return, I cannot return, which only intensifies the sorrow in my heart forever! For ten days, I have cried, I have laughed, I have suffered from insomnia, and my brain has been swollen! Friends say: "You've lost a lot of weight!" "You need to take care of your own body! After a major shock ends, often the devil of illness comes to visit!" I only noticed that a coughing cold has lasted for three weeks and still hasn't gotten better. I have lost control of everything!</p>
<p>Last year, when my mother died, I couldn't return; however, I could still swallow my tears and write five memorial pieces. This time, I wanted to write a eulogy, but I repeatedly started and stopped, my mind full of emotions, unable to pour them out onto the blank paper. My mother certainly loved and cared for me, but compared to my father, the difference was like heaven and earth. I can't forget my mother, how good she was to everyone, treating my unworthy brothers the same, treating relatives and neighbors the same. She was a compassionate person to all. As for my father, he loved me deeply, nurturing me when I was young, urging me when I grew up. His sixty years of hardship and hope were all placed on my head and shoulders. But how ashamed I am! How much I have made him "die with regrets"!</p>
<p>My heart of sorrow!</p>
<p>Eleventh, twenty-sixth, midnight, with tearful pen.</p>
<h3>Night School Scenery</h3>
<p>— Shadow呆</p>
<p>Taking classes at night is perhaps different from being a daytime student. Many classmates, unlike those in the daytime, are not from wealthy families. They work during the day and study at night. Therefore, everything here lacks the color of aristocracy. They earn their own money and study on their own, not needing their families to provide tuition, which is truly commendable!</p>
<p>Because studying here is voluntary, the classes are also different from regular schools. The teachers lecture, and everyone strains their ears to listen attentively, afraid of missing a word. Therefore, conflicts with teachers or booing at teachers, which are common in universities, never happen here. The order is very calm.</p>
<p>But perhaps there are exceptions here as well? Maybe what the teacher is lecturing is not engaging, and two hours of class can be truly boring. Sometimes, dismissing the class after just one hour is highly desired. Before the teacher even leaves the door, the students have already run off, saving themselves from sitting listlessly in the classroom with empty stomachs.</p>
<p>One night, it was the same situation. He was finishing the class, and the students were hoping to be dismissed after just one hour. But to their surprise, his energy was even better that night, and he lectured with great enthusiasm and interest. After the bell rang, the students thought the class was over and started to leave in advance. However, the teacher insisted on continuing to lecture, causing disappointment and a lack of enthusiasm!</p>
<p>Because of his continuous lecturing and great energy, an abnormal situation arose in the classroom. Some were packing their bags, others were grabbing their clothes. Because the teacher was lecturing with his head down, he didn't notice these actions. But then came another act: thump! thump! thump! The sound of leather shoes hitting the floor filled the small classroom in unison.</p>
<p>Unless one is a fool, everyone would know that this was the students' way of urging the teacher to dismiss the class. A discerning teacher would certainly understand what was happening upon hearing it. As a result, he dismissed the class unhappily. The stomping and foot-tapping had won the victory. After class, the students left the classroom, chatting and laughing, as if they could sing a triumphant song on their way home.</p>
<p>In reality, only a small portion of the students were packing their bags, grabbing their clothes, or even stomping their feet. The majority of the people wanted to continue listening, but the disturbance caused by a few led to losses for the many. Those few who didn't want to listen didn't need to come in the first place. Why did they come and then cause trouble? Ah, it was for the XXXXX marking on the attendance sheet. Otherwise, they wouldn't have come to class, but they could still get two credits.</p>
<h3>Eastern Palace, Western Palace, Cold Palace</h3>
<p>— Shao Lin</p>
<p>The S Academy in western Shanghai is a school that includes both primary and secondary schools as well as a kindergarten. The person in charge of school affairs is Mr. C. There are quite a few students in this school. Generally, students who are unwilling to attend other schools or who have</p>

<p>Please pearl drop into muddy water, muddy water has no choice but to request chanting Buddha. Throw a distracted heart into chaos, a distracted heart has no choice but to seek Buddha. Without bondage.</p>
<p>Without bondage, that is, Master Hongyi. His secular name is Li, his style name is Xishuang. Recently traveling between Zhejiang and Fujian.</p>
<p>special circumstances mostly attend this school. Therefore, the school doesn't need to advertise for new students, and there are still many applicants. Also, because the school's admission methods cater to the students' psychology, most students are happy to attend.</p>
<p>Principal C also holds a position at a certain exchange outside the school. Therefore, every day, he is either holding meetings here or elsewhere. In the evenings, he is either entertaining party A or party B. He is busy from morning till night. If anyone wants to visit him, they must notify him three days in advance and make an appointment for a time and place in order to meet him. Truly, it can be said that the capable are burdened with more work.</p>
<p>Among the teachers at S School, there is a female teacher named W, who is one of the most attractive teachers. After working with Mr. C, they became very close. They often went in and out together. Knowing people often saw them in the playground, but Mr. C was unaware. Last winter, S School hired another female teacher surnamed L to teach piano. Mr. C was very impressed at first sight. Over time, he often accompanied Ms. L to watch movies or picked her up by car for banquets. They were often seen together in dance halls and big hotels. Although Ms. W had heard rumors, she could only endure it. One Sunday, Principal C called Ms. L again to go to the movies. Ms. W found out about it. When they returned to school late at night, all the students were already asleep, as it was already 1 AM. The sound of arguing could be heard from Ms. W's bedroom, which lasted until 3 AM. From then on, this interesting drama spread throughout the school. Since then, no more disputes have been heard, as they have already formed an alliance under the city walls. It is said that the content of the alliance is that Principal C must subsidize Ms. W with a certain amount of money each month and visit Ms. W once a day. However, Mr. C is a married man, and his wife, Ms. X, still lives near the school outside. Therefore, the teachers and students of the school have given them the nicknames "Eastern Palace," "Western Palace," and "Cold Palace." The Eastern Palace refers to Ms. L, the Western Palace refers to Ms. W, and the Cold Palace refers to Mrs. C.</p>
<h3>Glory</h3>
<p>— Jue Ji</p>
<p>Having a speech manuscript, possessing fluent Mandarin, and displaying a lively attitude is all it takes to be bestowed with glory. The pursuers of glory are this group! Whoever is lucky will be the host of glory. || This is the common sentiment the night before the speech pre-selection meeting.</p>
<p>X X X X</p>
<p>The goddess of fortune has descended! The curtain rises on glory: in the spacious auditorium, a group of speech committee members enters. The chairman ascends the stage, the judges take their seats, and the speakers and audience sit below. The vast crowd is not noisy, maintaining an atmosphere of solemn tranquility, unlike the usual chaotic and boisterous gatherings in the auditorium. The world has been seduced by glory: quiet, joyful.</p>
<p>It's not just about muddling through. Luck always plays a role. Although talent should not be buried, ultimately talent must be combined with luck to achieve the positive side of glory.</p>
<p>It is a battlefield, even more tense than Zhuge Liang's debate with the scholars! "Wielding a silver tongue, striving for the top eight positions in eastern China," keep striving! Success or failure hinges on this one move! Those without courage retreat. Those with reputation maintain their past reputation. Those with talent come from behind and surpass others. To seek glory, one must have courage. Shyness and timidity are not acceptable.</p>
<p>Ninety minutes speed by, and three top talents are selected from among the nine heroes. The representative of the judges reports the results. The audience applauds like thunder, congratulating the three glorious angels on their victory. The goddess of fortune ascends to heaven and departs.</p>
<p>|| How unreasonable! Unfair, unfair... judging only by FACE, not by the quality of the speech...</p>
<p>|| What? Miss T has a very high reputation: her clear and graceful tone, fluent Mandarin, and natural attitude... shouldn't she be in the top position!</p>
<p>|| Don't talk about it. Her? She was so unprepared, simply lacking meaning. She spoke about "the future of college students," but ultimately didn't talk about any "future"... I rated her third, and that was already being generous... There's no way she's first...</p>
<p>|| That's right, that's how I predicted it. On the other hand, the one who got third place spoke extremely well! Meaning, pronunciation, Mandarin, posture were all excellent. He should have gotten first.</p>
<p>|| Let's not talk about it, let's not talk about it! Even the one who got second place spoke terribly. He was like a ventriloquist on stage, and he loved using parallel sentences. The "de" and "ma" particles were all perfectly matched, what a joke, what a joke...</p>
<p>|| …………………………</p>
<p>This period of clamor, with diverse opinions, leads to no conclusion.</p>
<p>However, Ms. T works very hard, not taking people's criticisms to heart. She humbly accepts Director C's guidance, striving for even greater glory.</p>

<h3>Shanghai (7)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Lao San</p>
<p>(Thirteen) Naturally Grown Country Girl</p>
<p>I followed behind my cousin. Her companions smiled mysteriously. My cousin, with light footsteps, turned her head back and extended two fingers towards the sky to them, nodding as if in understanding. I secretly wondered what newfangled thing this was in Shanghai.</p>
<p>My grandmother often said that my cousin and my mother were naturally grown country girls. Whenever my mother returned home, my cousin would always come along and stay for ten days to half a month. After Sister Min went missing, she stayed at my house even more often. When I returned from county school on Sundays, it was common for us two kids to steal away to the river to catch loaches, turning into "Negroes." However, whether my second Sister Min was in the middle of this, my memory is as blurry as a spring dream, because I instinctively felt that my cousin was more fun than Sister Min. She was like a maiden from a noble family. Even when she came to the river to watch us catch fish and pick up clams, she was full of disdain. Therefore, the image of Sister Min for me had ceased to exist long before we met again on the train.</p>
<p>After my mother and grandmother passed away one after the other, my cousin also never came to my house again. My uncle had always held the consistent policy of looking down on farmers. But during our short childhood interactions, we cousins were always childhood sweethearts, innocent and pure. Except for the time when I broke the goldfish bowl that my father had bought for her at the temple fair, the two little children refused to speak to each other for two days. Thinking of this, I looked at my cousin with her snake-like waist, and couldn't help but feel shy. The changes in life are truly magically mysterious. The cousin who used to catch loaches, the cousin who wrote long letters urging my brothers and me to work hard, was actually a city girl whom I didn't recognize when I met her. I hate that time is a man-eating demon. If only my grandmother had died a few years later, what would the naturally grown country girl have been like?</p>
<p>In an instant, a complex tide of thoughts surged into my heart. My footsteps naturally slowed down. My cousin had already walked through the stone-paved path and, in a dance-like posture, turned into the artistic automatic door of the Western-style house.</p>
<p>(Fourteen) Unwarranted Lesson</p>
<p>Walking up the stairs, my cousin said to me softly, "Wait in the parlor, I'll go in and see Dad. If he doesn't want to see guests today, then don't see him." As she spoke, she smiled, and those two dimples told me not to be lectured by my uncle for no reason.</p>
<p>Two minutes later, she peeked out half her body, closed her left eye, and called me in. My uncle was lying on his side to the right of the opium bed, his hair white, and thinner than I expected, like a dried mantis. He was wearing an extremely thick fur robe, and his two bony hands were tremblingly smoking. My cousin was standing next to him. I didn't know what season it was.</p>
<p>I called out to my uncle, and he nodded slightly. He seemed to be unable to speak, and the mouth of the opium pipe met his own. He took a puff of smoke effortlessly, quickly approaching the spout of the teapot, taking a sip. Two wisps of green smoke emerged from his nostrils. His hand was busy burning more opium. Seeing that I was still standing in front of the couch, he pointed with his finger to the lower end of the horizontal couch, indicating that I should sit. My cousin handed him a lit cigar, and he held the cigar in his mouth and said in a low voice, "When did you arrive in Shanghai?"</p>
<p>"Yesterday, Uncle,"</p>
<p>"Why didn't you come yesterday?" He put down the cigar, and the opium tar on his hand stuck to the opium pipe.</p>
<p>"It was too late when I arrived in Shanghai, and I was afraid it would be inconvenient."</p>
<p>I didn't dare say that I didn't want to come. My uncle often got angry for no reason, like a woman with hysteria. I tactfully told a lie. But my uncle's expression was unpleasant, as if he was about to spout an unwarranted lesson. Again, unable to speak, he put the mouth of the opium pipe to his lips. Holding the cigar and smoking more opium, he had returned to normal, and his fingers also trembled. He spoke briefly about trivial matters in the countryside. My cousin stood behind him, frequently gesturing with her eyes, seemingly blaming me for saying the wrong thing, or regretting that she had forgotten something, tightening her artificially shaped eyebrows. Seeing that her father was talking about something else, she made a face at me.</p>
<p>The conversation came to an end, and I finally stated my purpose.</p>
<p>"Ah! How unfortunate! I have to preach today. You'll probably be staying in Shanghai for a while, so move your luggage here first." He put more opium paste on the pipe.</p>
<p>A complete failure. I don't know how many times I've heard words like this in the past two years. Smart people don't want to tell you "there's no way," they make you feel like "there's no way." Sister Min's "future" was the same situation.</p>

<p>Film Special</p>
<h3>Interview with Chinese Film Artists (224) (Continued from Yesterday)</h3>
<p>— Sha Ji</p>
<p>(Ten) Cai Chusheng, Director of "Metropolitan Morning" (Middle)</p>
<p>"That's right. People generally believe that it is bad elements who are doing it, which inevitably leads to contempt for movies. In the future, the film industry itself will advance day by day, and the outdated will eventually be eliminated through natural selection. In any case, film art changes with the tide of the times, provided that there are sound talents who truly put in the work. In particular, intellectuals should especially help the development of films, because films are not just civilized dramas after all."</p>
<p>As he said this, someone pushed the door open and said that the photography studio was ready and waiting for him to shoot the scene. He replied:</p>
<p>"Tell them to wait a while, I still have something to do here."</p>
<p>"Oh, are you still shooting a scene, sir?" I felt apprehensive. "Then please proceed. We can talk again after you finish shooting the scene."</p>
<p>"No, it doesn't matter, it's okay for me to wait a while longer." He continued, "Some people say that I am arrogant and like to put on airs, but this is actually my nature. I am not very willing to interact with people. At the same time, I feel that meaningless socializing is not an attitude that artists should have. I believe that a true artist's attitude should be authentic, sincere, and diligent. They should work faithfully for their art and humbly accept other people's criticisms. Regardless of whether a particular criticism is correct or not, this incorrect criticism must have its social basis. Any kind of criticism arises, and it will never be without its inherent reasons. Similarly, a bad attitude towards people will also cause them to have negative feelings."</p>
<p>"Then what are your opinions on the current film direction, sir?" I said.</p>
<p>"I don't want to express any opinions on this point... It is very clear that the unprecedented economic crisis has already affected the unrest in Chinese society... From all aspects, it seems that there is no way to destroy it, nor is there any way to build it... At this time, film creators can only play the clown and perform a few sets of so-called Humor. In short, surrounded by all aspects, the screenwriter must be well-rounded, taking into account the political environment, capital, and public opinion.</p>
<p>"However, I believe that the psychology of the audience changes with the tide of the times. Now, everyone is tired of living in a feudal society and hopes to gain something new in movies. The past fantasy films have been rejected by them. This is by no means a simple and rigid instruction of a certain theory, but rather a demand for the same reality in movies as in their own lives. And our responsibility is to work harder to improve the audience's vision, so that they can gain new things from the movies. This is to influence the audience's lives. If China has good film talents, then in the near future, works that are not suitable for the times will inevitably be eliminated."</p>
<p>As he said this, he seemed very excited. At this time, I asked him again:</p>
<p>"Now, please also say something about your own works."</p>
<p>"I have already said that I play the clown and do somersaults in my works, as is the case in "Song of the Fishermen," but I will never make it completely meaningless. To be honest, although I do not advance, I will never retreat. At least my works can always have some effect in the public. I came from farming to stores, from stores to the film industry. This life experience has undoubtedly given me a considerable understanding of the current society through my own feelings. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3>Review of "Her Highness Commands"</h3>
<p>— Li Fu</p>
<p>Her Highness Commands</p>
<p>After watching Ufa's "Her Highness Commands" (produced in 1931), I was immediately reminded of a conversation that I had once seen with Ludwig Klitsch, the manager of Ufa, in a film magazine. He said: "The mission of cinema is not to explain all the serious problems of modern times, but to advocate optimism to mankind. At the same time, the main purpose of most films is to give some comfort to the masses who are oppressed by hardship. We want to let them know, within the two or three hours of watching the film, that there is beauty, joy, and peace in life. In addition to these purposes, of course, the film should reflect the national crisis in the spirit of the modern era. We want to awaken the past glory of the German Empire and strengthen the German people's enthusiasm for construction." Klitsch was not only the manager of Ufa, but also the secretary of Finance Minister Hugenberg. Therefore, his views clearly represent the "film policy of Germany in extraordinary times."</p>
<p>The facts are before our eyes. The films of Germany in the past year or two have completely reflected the above-mentioned "mission." For example, the mission of military films such as "Dawn" (Morgenrot) is to awaken the past glory of the German Empire. The missions of "Dragon Soaring, Phoenix Dancing," "Fairy of the Rainbow Skirt," and even this "Her Highness Commands" are all to advocate temporary optimism to the hardworking masses.</p>
<p>This is a completely fanciful Non-sense film. It takes the citizens who are gasping for breath in "extraordinary times" into the imaginary forbidden palace, allowing them to see the beautiful princess, hear the sweet love songs, and experience many light-hearted events that cannot be experienced in the real world. The story, as usual, involves heroes and beauties. The plot is still about love leading to reunion. Originally, so-called Non-sense works do not require a rigorous structure, so the places where this script grabs the audience are only in those interludes that are not related to the story, and in the occasional witty remarks that can make people laugh.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, this film has all the superior conditions for commercial success, but its shortcoming lies in the script itself. Feng Lin Hawei and Henry Gallay, these two promising actors, did not achieve much here, especially Hawei, whose performance can be said to be far below "Dragon Soaring, Phoenix Dancing." Director Hans Schwarz and photographer Gutar Rittau can also be regarded as Ufa's first-class partners, but there is nothing particularly noteworthy about their achievements in this film.</p>
<p>This is a film for you to relax and be entertained. If you are tired after work and don't want to think about serious problems, but just want to indulge yourself temporarily, then you might as well take a tour of this enchanting forbidden palace. Of course, if you can understand the dialogue and the copied subtitles, then you will definitely be able to temporarily forget the bitterness of a pure life.</p>
<h3>Review of "Midnight Gunfire"</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>丨Beijing Screening丨</p>
<p>Since 1930, Chinese cinema has begun to show new trends, and the Lianhua Film Company should occupy an important place in our memories. After "Three Modern Women" was released, our expectations for Lianhua increased. This is a clear example of Lianhua's productions being able to attract a wide audience. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that Lianhua's producers would take a careful attitude towards their productions and not disappoint the audience. However, this is not the case. Although we do not say that its productions have a tendency to regress, some films are disappointing, especially the works of the Guangdong studios. The recently released "Cuckoo's Cry in the Ancient Temple" has been criticized by the audience, which is naturally due to its simple cause-and-effect retribution. Now, we have this feudal individualistic "Midnight Gunfire."</p>
<p>Now I just want to talk about the story.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the plot of a detective film should be very compact, with many twists and turns, and many red herrings. This is something we can often find examples of in American productions. Of course, we don't necessarily advocate detective films per se, but they are used to create suspense and attract the audience, so as far as the story is concerned, the above points must be done as much as possible.</p>
<p>However, "Midnight Gunfire" extensively prolongs developments outside the main theme, while neglecting the main points of a detective film. For example, the playwright wrote the love relationship between Qian Shuxian and Zhou Huaiyuan very lengthily, from returning from abroad to the breakup of their love. This is done very seriously, but all of this has no direct relationship with the center of the plot, making people suspect that this is a purely romantic film. It is not until the gunshot that the film turns to the main theme. However, we can determine in advance that Qian Wuneng is definitely not the real murderer, because the knife he holds has already been made too obvious. But these are not the main shortcomings. What we want to say is why Zhou Huaiyuan does not marry Qian Shuxian. According to the development of the play, they should be together. Can the hatred of killing his father really break them up? We think this feudal concept is unnecessary. For example, there is no reason to portray Qian Wuneng as a rogue. This does not have a positive or negative match with Qian Ruming's treachery. As for the affair of the concubine, there should be some introduction beforehand. The only shot of a concubine exposing her chest before the gunshot is not enough, because the appearance of her lover is too sudden. Although people who often watch detective films may not decide that the concubine is the real murderer, it can be seen from this that the playwright's arrangement of red herrings is still insufficient.</p>
<p>However, on the other hand, individual techniques such as photography are all above the horizontal line. Although the actors are not pleasing, they are very serious, especially the heroine Huang Manli and He Daqing, both of whom have unique qualities. Similarly, we can see that the director has some achievements in these areas, such as the choice of location shots, etc., but it makes people feel that it is too uneconomical.</p>
<p>Regarding small details, we can point out the close-up of Qian Shuxian's car in the end, and Li Mengqiu catching bed bugs in prison. However, the scene of Li Mengqiu's servant combing his hair is extremely ridiculous and boring.</p>
<h3>"Hero of the Range"</h3>
<p>— Review of Moore</p>
<p>"Hidden Gold" 丨New Light丨</p>
<p>The domestic film "Fragrant Grass Beauty" is said to have been banned by the public security bureau because it was an anti-imperialist film. Following that is this "Hero of the Range"!</p>
<p>Tom Mix and his horse "Tony" opened up a path in the American film industry, winning a considerable audience and earning a lot of money for golden America. But in the end, because of the tastelessness and formulaic nature of the stories, even the lower classes and children in the United States expressed boredom! And it can only fill the gap in Chinese theaters caused by the banning of Chinese films due to anti-imperialism.</p>
<p>"Hero of the Range" is a typical "Western." It is not only a martial arts film, but also a ranch film.</p>
<p>I don't think I need to talk about the story, because it's just "righteous heroes killing people" anyway. In this kind of story, we certainly can't find a bit of thought and power to promote the world. What there is is just the fantasy of the pitiful petty bourgeoisie.</p>
<p>Directing martial arts films is originally a bit different from ordinary films. The difference is to leave as much film as possible to allow the actors to show their martial arts, because the main point of martial arts films is these.</p>
<p>But here, when allowing the actors to show their martial arts, a clever director will not mechanically let the actors in martial arts films really work hard like jockeys or people playing tricks. He should use all kinds of methods to make the atmosphere tense, so that the audience does not have to see the protagonist running a horse and shooting a gun to feel nervous. Then, when the protagonist appears, as long as he puts in a little effort, the audience will feel satisfied.</p>
<p>Moreover, heroes and heroines are not the only path for martial arts films. In martial arts films, we should jump out of this range, because this is really too old-fashioned, and the audience is really too tired of it. "Hero of the Range" completely fails to achieve the points I mentioned below.</p>
<p>Tom Mix's martial arts are indeed very good. However, he has no facial expressions at all. Naturally, because martial arts films pay attention to large movements, facial expressions are inevitably relaxed. But in tense moments, using a facial close-up and loving "eye language" will definitely help the effect of the film. His horse is very good.</p>
<p>Finally, we should also point out the spirit of sacrifice in the American film industry. Because they want to be realistic, they do not hesitate to destroy valuable things. This is of course impossible in the Chinese film industry, which has weak capital.</p>
<h3>Film Novel Auspicious Land (1) Directed by Shao Zuiweng of Tianyi Film Company</h3>
<p>— Cao Xuesong</p>
<p>It is a hot summer. Ah! Great summer, not only does it make the fields wear green brocade, but also makes the beans on the paths ripe, and the melons in the melon fields are just right to pick.</p>
<p>In this scorching summer, although wealthy young masters and ladies drink ice and chew melons all day long, and still keep shouting about the heat; but A Liang, who lives in the countryside, and Xiang Gu, a girl from the same village, work hard in the fields for a living, regardless of how hot the weather is. A Liang is hoeing the ground, Xiang Gu is picking melons, and they work hard while talking and laughing happily. Although they are sweating a lot, they don't feel tired.</p>
<p>Xiang Gu filled two baskets with melons, and A Liang was afraid that she, a girl, would not be able to carry the load, so he volunteered to carry them for her and send her back. Unexpectedly, after taking a few steps, because the melons were packed too full, one fell out of the basket onto the ground. "Ah! The melon is broken!" A Liang said to Xiang Gu, looking at the broken melon. "It doesn't matter. Let's eat it," Xiang Gu said gently.</p>
<p>So, they stopped in the shade of the green willow and sat side by side on the green velvet-like grass, dividing the melon and chewing it slowly. Good birds sang with silver voices in the branches, and the flowing waves flowed slowly in the stream beside them, as if keeping pace. The surrounding scenery was picturesque, the love companion in front of them was like a flower, and the sweet melon in their mouths was like honey. Ah, it was so sweet to their hearts, and they couldn't help but be intoxicated in this beautiful scene.</p>
<p>After they finished eating the melon, they chatted again for a while. A Liang still carried the melons and sent her back. When they arrived home, Xiang Gu ran to her mother very naively and said, "Mom, it's all thanks to him for carrying these many melons back for me." Xiang Gu said this to plead for A Liang.</p>
<p>"You can't even carry these few melons yourself, why do you need someone to carry them for you?" A Liang really didn't expect Xiang Gu's mother to say such a thing, so he had no choice but to walk away dejectedly. Xiang Gu, with a face full of displeasure, had no choice but to silently lower her head!</p>
<p>A few days later, the big landlord Xu Hongye brought two servants and rode a horse to the beautiful Linghua Village to find a cemetery, because his old father had been sick for a long time, and in recent days, he had dysentery more severely. He expected that his old man had no great hope, so before he died, he came to the countryside in advance to find an auspicious place for his long sleep. (To be continued)</p>
