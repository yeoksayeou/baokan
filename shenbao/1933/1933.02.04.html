<h3 id="c27">東北協會成立穗 <a href="#c27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>邇近國内有心人士。鑒於解决東北問題爲我國當前之急務。而欲解决東北問題。則又必須先羣策羣力。爲切實恢復之運動。同時尤須瞭然於東北一切文化物質之内容。以爲恢復後開發之準備。特發起組織東北協會。並已於日昨正式成立。在東北淪亡已逾一載之後。我國内始有此種研究東北問題與挽救東北之擴大組織產生。雖曰「亡羊補牢。」然而吾人究深惜其爲時已晚。</p>
<p>東北大陸泱　萬里在物質上旣爲我國之富源。在地勢上尤爲我國之屛障。此富饒之大陸。日本久已伺側垂涎。在甲午戰爭之前後。對我東北即孜孜研究。不遺餘力。政府提倡於上。國民努力於下。調查東北資源者有滿蒙資源館。研究東北農事者有農事試騐塲。其他如滿鐵會社所出版關於東北各種問題之專書。年亦不下百餘種。即至細微如農夫驅使牛羊之口令等問題。亦無不有精確之調查與詳盡之著作。其調查研究東北。旣備極詳盡。知東北自最明。而其奪取我東北。亦遂如探囊取物九一八禍變之幕布揭開。東北半壁河山。即不崇朝而相繼淪陷。反觀我國。則在九一八以前。舉國上下。都罔加措意。任人解剖化騐。即九一八以後。雖注意此問題者較多。研究此問題之出版亦較多。然而東北亡矣。時已晚矣。猶記本報於前年七月間萬寳山案發生之始。即曾於此一問題作疾聲之呼籲。幷詳陳利害。冀以喚起國人之注意。惜乎血淚之呼號。終未能博得國人之一顧也。</p>
<p>東北淪亡。今巳一載有餘矣。白山黑水之間。暴敵與奸正相與合奏其勝利之曲。故吾人認爲我國當前最迫切之問題。已遠超過研究東北救濟東北難民。而應爲如何奪回東北。丨如何從强宼之手。奪國我大好之河山。在今日山河破碎之情勢下。而猶徒言研究。徒言救濟。是不僅失之迂緩。而其流弊所至。或且恰足以轉移人民之視綫。轉移人民之注意力。使東北之收復。愈益渺茫無期。</p>
<p>雖然。吾人言此。非謂東北協會之組織。遂爲毫無意義也。不過吾人之意。以爲東北爲我國之生命綫。東北失則華北危。華北動搖。則我全局皆爲不安。故吾人今日而言禦侮。必先奪回東北。今日而言救國。亦必先奪回東北。今日而言解决東北問題。尤擒奪回東北無他道。吾人更堅决認定。東北問題之最後解决。不在於日内瓦。亦不在於東京。而在於我國自身。日人旣以血與奪去我東北。則吾人亦惟有以血與鐵奪回我東北。集中全力作堅决之一拚。而如何集中全力。如何作開始爭鬥之實際準備。此一鉅責。東北協會當然應急起負荷。義無可辭。</p>
<p>吾人認定一民族受人壓迫。受人蹂躪而無息無聲者。必歸於滅亡。反之一民族受人壓迫受人蹂躪而能奮起鬥爭者。終不至滅亡。茲當東北協會成立之初。吾人謹以斯意貢獻於該會諸君子。幷切盻該會認淸其當前之重責而踐實邁進。</p>

<p>蘇聯在今日、雖爲一確守和平政策之國家、其軍備僅重在防而不重在攻、又因正在努力進行社會建設之故、軍備上之布置、遂不及其他國家、但因其主義政策之不同、世界資本主義之國、正耽耽環伺、有蹈𨻶而進之勢、最近遠東惡劣之風雲、尤使蘇聯感受一大威脅、故其社會建設、雖在猛烈加速進行、而同時軍備方面之準備、亦有日增月盛之勢、用在第一次五年計劃中、關於軍事方面、特别縮短爲三年完成、（陸海軍預算一九二七年爲七萬萬六千萬盧布、一九三二年度增至十二萬萬八千萬盧布、）可見其如何加緊防備之情形矣、在不久將來之世界鬥爭中、無疑的蘇聯實居在一極重之地位、尤其在遠東舞台、蘇聯實爲一要角、故其最近軍備之實况、當爲國人所亟欲知者、特撮誌厓略如左、</p>
<p>（兵制大要）　蘇聯兵制、係徵兵制度、規定服役年限、自十九歲至四十歲、共二十二年、徵集前受準備敎育兩年、現役五年、後備十五年、在現役五年中、在營二年、休息三年、依照蘇聯憲法規定、非勞動者不得服兵役、以服兵役爲一種名譽與權利、故蘇聯靑年、一届成年、無有不服兵役者、蘇聯陸軍、可分二種、一即常備軍、一即後備軍、後備軍規定於五年間施以八個月至十一個月之軍事敎育、此種制度、乃爲欲以極經濟的方法、使軍事敎育、得普及於一般壯丁、且以政府權力行之、可見蘇聯軍事敎育、實屬異常普及、一旦有事、其能參加作戰之兵士、爲數極鉅、</p>
<p>（軍力槪况）　蘇聯平時兵力、約有一百三十萬人、其中步兵約七十餘師團、騎兵十數師團、獨立旅團十個左右、其他則爲航空隊化學隊、此等陸軍、駐紥於列寗格勒防區者、有八師團、駐紥於莫斯科防區者有十二師團、駐紥烏克蘭防區者有二十一師團、駐紥伏爾茄防區者有六師團、駐紥北喀克落防區者有八師團、駐紮白俄防區者十二師團、駐紥西比利亞防區者有三師團、遠東方面有七師團、中央亞細亞有四師團二旅團、獨立喀克莎方面有七師團一旅團、其戰鬥力分述於次、㈠步兵、每師團分三聯隊、每聯隊包含連絡小隊一、斥堠小隊一、衝鋒大隊三、中隊九、（輕機關槍小隊九）重機關槍中隊三、大隊砲兵小隊三、聯隊砲兵大隊一、中隊二、化學小隊二、衝鋒小隊三、機關槍小隊二、每一師團所配置之軍火、共有輕機關槍一六二、重機關槍一○八、野砲三六、其次爲手溜彈、㈡騎兵、蘇聯騎兵之精、向居世界之冠、一九二○年俄波之戰、俄即以其精良之騎兵而制勝、惟騎兵在現代戰術上、一般已認爲無大用處、故蘇聯雖有精良騎兵、在將來戰塲上是否能居若何重要地位、尙屬問題、惟在廣漠之平原上作戰時、通訊運輸、騎兵尙極需要、㈢鐵甲車隊、鐵甲車自英軍於一九二六年九月使用於遜墨戰塲上、一九一七年英軍在堪普列戰場突以數百部鐵甲車大破德軍以後、各國都不惜巨資、紛紛製造、蘇聯對於此項車隊、近亦改良增造、進步甚速、㈣航空隊、蘇聯空軍、在十年以前、尙屬十分貧弱、一九二二年僅有二十中隊、一九二五年即增至七十八中隊、一九二八年增至一○四中隊、現在則已達二百中隊以上、其中陸上飛機一九四中隊、水面飛機二○中隊、共有飛行機二千二百架、而蘇聯尙預定在十年之内、再須增加二百中隊、關於航空製造工業、現在全國亦已有二十五家、所製造之總重量二十噸、級超重爆擊機、視德意各國出品、並無遜色、同時蘇聯全體人民、對於發展航空上之努力、亦特别蓬勃、有一國防飛行化學協會、係半官半民性質、其中會員達一千七百餘萬人、此會任務、乃爲在政府指導之下、對國民實施軍事訓練、在各地設有軍事化學研究機關·俱樂部·射擊會·騎馬會等、對於航空及毒瓦斯之研究、尤特爲注重、此外又設有多數之飛機學校、養成一般航空技術人員、蓋蘇聯土地廣漠、鐵路稀少、交通不便、故亟謀航空之發達、平時旣可供交通之用、戰時更可便利軍事、前年蘇聯對於航空建設之投資、共達一萬萬五千萬盧布、航空線在去年已達四萬九千粁、此皆蘇聯人民及其政府一切努力之結果也、㈤軍事化學、現代戰爭、將進而爲化學戰爭、各國對於軍事化學之研究、無不精益求精、蘇聯對於此項軍事設施、亦異常嚴密、國民軍事化學敎育、力求普及、現有化學戰學校三、化學兵器研究所六、化學兵器製造所四、</p>
<p>（兵士能力）　蘇聯兵士、有特别耐苦之特性、故若能加以良好之裝備、完全之軍事敎育、更有卓拔之指揮官以領導之、實可成爲世界最强之陸軍、關於此點、世界人士皆承認之、在昔帝政時代、因國民敎育不普及、兵力多係文盲、每臨戰陣、輒因智識欠缺而錯過許多機會、革命以來、因政府勵行普及敎育之故、文盲日見减少、兵士在入營前、都已受過相當敎育、入營又繼續受訓練、兵士造就成績極佳、尤其在精神敎育、即政治敎育、特别注意、其目的蓋無非在使每個人民都成爲一共產細胞、故蘇聯兵士、在現代可謂優良兵士、惜中下級軍官指揮戰略能力、大都異常幼稚、此實爲蘇軍最大缺點、</p>
<p>（軍人待遇）　蘇聯政府對於兵士之待遇、甚爲周密、對於現役軍事、固不必說、即在鄕軍人、亦特别注意、如退職死亡生產補助金之支給、家族疾病治療之救助、免費乘車、子女敎育優待權等等、都有相當規定、對於現役軍人之待遇、更有可述者、如㈠對於入營現役兵、則將分給之農場、代爲保存、㈡在復習敎育召集時、可領取勞動資金、或失業補助金、㈢爲避免兵士役滿後失業起見、每預留職務、供給退伍兵充當、㈣關於郵稅輸送費等、亦可受相當免稅之優待、㈤住宅分配、亦極爲優越、此類對於兵士之優待、在他國不免異常難辦、在蘇聯則極爲易易、蓋其社會制度、本來如此、即非兵士、人民生活、本亦十分安適也、</p>
<p>（遠東關係）　於此吾人有須附帶一述者、即東省事變以後、蘇聯對於遠東方面之增兵是、據日方消息、遠東蘇聯兵力、實達十餘萬以上、然日本武力旣有由大陸向西北急進之勢、則蘇聯爲自身安全計、自不能不有相當防備、蘇聯當局曾一再表示、蘇聯並無向任何一國挑戰意、若他國有意侵入蘇聯、則蘇聯當有以自衛、故吾人不能謂蘇聯增兵遠東、即有與日本衝突之準備、亦不能因蘇聯無積極表示、遂謂蘇聯已與日本有相當妥協、我人料彼蘇聯、自有其一定之主張、非至相當時期不能表明也、（一月五日）</p>

<p>（官商開會協以謀我）日本陸海軍重要人員、日前舉行會議、商定長江軍事佈置、現已閉幕、領事署昨又召開秘密會議、到重要僑商甚多、軍人亦有參加、其重要議决案、不易探悉、所可知者、㈠密與華界米商接洽、購買大批米糧、實行屯積、以備非常、㈡日界内交通處、嚴密佈防、必要時即架設電網、㈢收買漢奸、視察我方要塞動作、及軍隊駐防、或移防地點、（四）在漢日僑、一律發給槍械、（五）每週由領事召集密會一次、又日界居留民團行政委員長居川、召集日僑商、開商務大會、到四十餘人、經議决各商在華界營業者、須將貨物種類·價値·數量·及營業狀况、按日詳細報告備查、</p>
<p>（廣設機關探我軍情）日人對于我方軍情、極爲注意、連日派遣浪人、喬裝華人或利用漢奸、分赴武昌·漢陽·龜山·兵工廠·及下游田家鎭各處偵視、行踪詭秘、近又設立偵探機關二處、一爲海軍陸戰隊情報部、由海軍軍官田尻指揮、一爲日警署高等科及聯合電通社、由日領署指揮、對於武漢京滬各大小報紙、訂閱至二十二份、將一切反日文字搜集成帙、對各報負責人員、編輯人員姓名略歷、及經濟來源、銷報份數、均有詳細調查、軍事機關所在及與日租界毘連之特一區、曁十三署所屬地叚、且繪有圖表、日海陸軍官、昨沿日租界視察一週、並至劉家廟附近守望台瞭望、其探我軍情、可謂無微不致矣、</p>

<p>打消辭意、詳情分記如下、</p>
<p>（辭職經過）陳部長自就任以來、雖有發展海軍之計劃、奈巧媂難爲無米之炊、終因經費困難、非但發展之計劃無從實現、即現狀亦難維持、一二八之役、海軍因未奉到政府命令、未曾參加作戰、致國人亦有所責難、凡此種種、皆陳部長消極之原因、迨至上月下旬、陳部長乃决然呈請行政院辭職、同時並通令全體部屬、聲述辭職之苦衷、囑令安心服務、陳部長本人、則於上月三十日悄然來滬、寓居外灘匯中飯店、宋代院長接到陳部長之辭呈後、除指令慰留外、並電召行政院秘書長褚民誼氏、於昨日來滬、轉達政府慰留之意、</p>
<p>（褚民誼談）褚秘書長於昨晨八時許到滬、當即返寓休息、旋即驅車往訪陳部長於匯中飯店、談約一小時、始辭出、據褚秘書長語中央社記者、陳部長之辭職原因有三、（一）爲身體欠佳、（二）爲海部經費困難、（三）爲外間不諒、屢加責難、故消極辭職、本人奉宋代院長之命來滬慰留、並與商洽困難各點、結果異常圓滿、陳部長已允打消辭意、日内即行晋京回任、</p>
<p>（陳紹寛談）記者又訪陳部長於匯中飯店、詢以辭意是否已打消、據陳氏談、本人自忝長海部、迄未有成績、言念及此、殊覺愧對國人、去年送上呈辭、迄未邀准、顧際此内憂外患交迫之時、海軍關係國防、至爲重要、故决引咎告退、以讓賢能、俾海軍得以早日擴充、國防得以鞏固、且去志堅决、擬於辭職後、即以公民資格、參加抗日工作、廻憶去年淞滬戰事、海部因未奉命令、故未曾協助十九路軍抗日、輒引爲畢生隱痛、因軍艦之出動、例須服從上級命令、而國人不諒、羣相責難、實屬悵憾、陳氏又謂海軍部經費之拮据、幾臻極點、每月雖規定經費五十萬元、但實際上僅得四十萬元、而部屬各機關開支之浩大、在在需欵、與歐美各國海軍經費相較、誠有天壤之隔、設法擴充、實爲急務云云、</p>

<h3 id="c165">虚榮娘娘 <a href="#c165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>打不破的舊歷新年，有許多穿了新衣服的紅男綠女在四處大出風頭，何嘗爲耆國難臨頭而减少他們的興趣？喜在在後塲中總得一段很尖刻的「虚榮娘娘」笑語，把來寫在後面，這是不識字而愛虚榮的婦女們的當頭棒喝啊！</p>
<p>虚榮娘娘開了伊的描金箱子在那裏出神！</p>
<p>伊有眞毛葛皮襖，又有軟緞裙，可惜被一件簇新的大衣遮蔽了，不能夠使人家知道伊的美在其中；要是，不披大衣，又不能和許多大衣除中姊妹們比一比誰的風頭最健？</p>
<p>虧伊想出一個笑話奇談的計畫！伊央求人家寫着兩張字條兒，一條「内有眞毛葛皮襖，」掛在胸部；一條「内有軟緞裙，」掛在小腹部；那麽，大衣裏面的好衣服，不會終於埋沒了。</p>
<p>伊在人叢中往來，果然引起了許多人的注意，伊很驕傲地自信這個計畫不錯。但是，爲着閙市擠軋的緣故，走了一程路，伊的胸前和小腹上的標語，被人家擠去了！</p>
<p>標語遺失後的虚榮娘娘，便不能襮露自己的美在期中了！伊在懊喪着，但是，伊又笑逐顏開了。爲什麽呢？只爲伊在道旁拾得兩張字條兒，伊不識字，只道是本人遺失的東西，仍舊一上一下的佩掛着。</p>
<p>伊又走到閙市中，哎呀！不得了！交通擠斷了！人山人海的包圍起來了！伊才慌了手脚而奮命的呼救，總算警察得力把伊救出於重圍之中，立時扯去伊的上下標語，且詰問伊爲什麽佩掛這招蜂引蝶的字條兒？虚榮娘娘驚魂略定，才把伊的經過情形一一向警察報告。</p>
<p>「娘娘，你字都不識，也要出風頭麽？你胸前佩掛的是人家大門上脫落的字條：「貴客光顧，在此揖鈴。」你小腹上佩掛的是厠所脫落的字條：「諸位小便，請進一步。」</p>
<h3 id="c166">我家的司閽老人 <a href="#c166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— 鵑雲</p>
<p>我家的司閽老人姓章，六十多歲年紀，效命疆塲曾有二十多年的經歷。他老鄕是湖南，十九歲上就當湘勇，累功陞到正哨，現在是連長的資格；爲人也忠直豪爽，我們喚他一聲老章。</p>
<p>近幾年來，他看見日宼猖獗，國事岌岌，常常對着人嘆息不已，偶而便和我談到他從前甲午的抗日之戰。</p>
<p>他記得那年是光緒十九年，李鴻章貶任兩廣總督，大學士王文韶當政，高麗告急的表章已和雪片一般地飛來，王文韶主戰，那時湖南撫臺吳大徵，便請纓充當先鋒，統率了湘軍二百營，浩浩蕩蕩，殺出山海關而來。老章却在吳大徵麾下當一名第五營的正哨，穿着得勝馬褂，武生巾，率領了步卒一百多人。</p>
<p>當時京奉鐵路，纔通到山海關，這還是他們頭一次通火車呢。</p>
<p>守山海關的大將李廣九，最是饒勇善戰，率領老湘營十一營。此外還有李鴻章的淮軍六十營，連各處軍隊，足足有十五萬人以上。</p>
<p>新上前敵，勇氣百倍，連打兩仗，都是大勝；倭寇已逼退到海城附近，一過海城，便是高麗地界，要是乘勝力追，不難殺得倭宼片甲不歸。同時劉永福在福建也很得利，不料李鴻章暗自作梗，力主求和，情願割地賠欵，暗中截扣子彈。他和王文韶意氣不投，非使一般主戰派一敗塗地不可！像他那麽喪心病狂，中國大事，都送在他一個人的手裏！</p>
<p>自然是在那時能打敗了日本，日本也不能猖獗到今日的一天。</p>

<p>— 墨逸</p>
<p>「這兒是你的府上麽？」那個人望着張榮久說：「我走得疲極了，想喝點兒水，請你給我······喲······痛······」</p>
<p>張榮久聽了沒說什麽，只點了一點頭便到屋子裏去取水。</p>
<p>那個人自送張榮久進了屋子，回頭向趙天笑了一笑，做着很熱心的樣兒道：</p>
<p>咱們做了義勇軍也跟他們一樣，準得把那些缺德的敵人全結果了丨像你才說的那三個人······怎麽啦？那三位？······」</p>
<p>「可不是麽？準得去拚命······那三位麽？哈是這麽一回事兒：昨天早上有三個義勇軍他們還背着大刀，那個樣兒眞像一個戲台上的黃天霸，上這兒來探路，咱們就詳詳細細的告訴了他們。好小子，眞有他門，當夜川們就聽了一夜的槍聲······」</p>
<p>這時，張榮久端了一碗水，從屋子裏走了出來，聽見趙大的那種不知輕重的話，就大聲喝道：</p>
<p>「老趙，你怎麽愛那麽胡說八道，你親眼瞧見了那三個義勇軍麽？昨天夜裏你沒有睡覺，大淸早來說夢話啦丨」張榮久隨手把一碗水遞給了那個人，又加了兩句道：「你别聽他的話，老趙是咱們這兒出名的會吹牛的人；他聽了你說義勇軍，就跟你鬧着玩啦！」</p>
<p>一陣黑雲從西北角上給呼呼的狂風吹了過來，一霎時，好容易掙扎出來的太陽又屈服在烟幕彈似的雲層後面。那個人慢慢的喝着水，眼珠兒在他們三個人臉上溜動着，臉上浮起得意的微笑。</p>

<p>九月十六日，栗子溝村的人們，正在吃午飯的時候，鵝掌般的大雪在空中給怒吼的西北風捲成一團團的，落在地方的那股猛勁兒，和轟炸機上擲下來的炸彈差不多，眞能把一個人轟死。這時除了三羣黃色動物在雪中蠕蠕的動着，已經看不見什麽人了。（三）</p>
<p>我聽了他的話，很能想起十九軍的抗日之戰，便合了眼睛，不作一聲。</p>

<p>— 百合</p>
<p>人生總不能永抱着獨身主義。做了堂堂七尺鬚眉，總不能一世不娶老婆。娶了老婆，總逃不了維持家庭，履行夫婦同居的義務。但是夫婦同居，怎樣才能享受家庭樂趣，這確是一個很重大的問題。現在試把在下的御妻術公開請一般娶了夫人，而享不到家庭樂趣的讀者，仔細討論一下。</p>
<p>俗語有一句，呌做「愛妻敬丈母」，所以要使妻子喜歡，第一須要把丈母孝敬得如太上玉皇大帝，不可有些違抝。丈母的衣食住，當然缺一不可，就是喝酒，抽大烟，也不可道一個不字。因了愛妻敬丈母，愛屋及烏，凡是岳父，舅子，大姨，小姨，都應當加意照拂，岳父母壽終正寢，不消說，應當哀毀成禮，後喪逾於前喪，就是舅子娶妻，小姨出閣，一切排塲，也當闊乎其闊，雖然舉僨，也當黽勉從事。</p>
<p>做了丈夫的，在外吃辛吃苦掙來的錢，應當一古腦兒交給妻子，這是一種當然的義務，就是祖造的田地房屋契張借據，以及自幼所積蓄的壓　　等，也須　給妻子去保管與支配，做丈夫　，不可自私。假使做丈夫的要在外遇夜，或是有甚麽性的野心，便　須預先向妻徵求意見。因爲丈夫是妻子的丈夫，丈夫當然不可漠視妻　。</p>
<p>第三是妻的生活，應當悉隨妻之所好。譬如妻愛交男朋友，丈夫不可加以干涉。妻每夜要聽戲，吃大菜，丈夫不可向着伊皺眉。妻子每天喜歡睡到下午三點鐘起牀，丈夫不准大聲喧擾，驚破好夢。這不過是舉的幾個例。總之，妻子的生活應當以任其自然發展爲天經地義</p>

<p>— 郭蘭馨</p>
<p>東西中有實用的，也有裝飾品。</p>
<p>展望人羣也有實用與裝飾品的分别：一樣大衆中的一個人，但分出了有的能建樹一番事業，大的爲整個人類，整個世界，整個國家謀幸福，小的也有爲社會地方謀利益，這樣纔不負做一個有用的人。有的却飽食終日，無所用心，沒有能力，沒有靈魂，這樣不過是人羣中的一個行屍走肉的裝飾品罷了，東西中的裝飾品，不過佔去地位，却能夠增加，佈置上的美觀與藝術化，人羣中的裝飾品，完全沒有什麽用處，反而消耗有用的物質，而這一羣裝飾品結集在一處，會使社會產一條沉澱滅落的路，祇是有害而無益，啊這多餘的裝飾品。</p>
<p>現在國難方殷的時光，做一個國民的，食毛踐土，應該大家起來盡國民的責任，擔當打破國難的工作，行屍走肉的裝飾品，應該打倒，並且應該消滅。啊這一羣多餘裝飾品的人們，會在這樣狂颷怒吼般緊張的國難中彙集在那滅落，頽廢，浪漫的所在盡情的在享樂，撞着它們的埋葬之鐘。</p>
<h3 id="c171">上海夜話 <a href="#c171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— 張若谷</p>
<p>新夏威夷</p>
<p>大除夕，滿想到上海城隍廟去趕一年一度的夜市集，偕伙伴黃同志，到城裏也是園訪穆羅茶。穆羅茶是一個讚美以廟字爲文化中心的藝術學者，我們想邀他同去，一定可以添加不少的興趣。</p>
<p>在一間方磚地的客廳裏，八仙桌上高燃兩枝紅燭，中間供着祭祖先的餅餌糖菓，穆羅茶正伴着兩位穿一九三四年式羅宋脂羔黑大衣的少女談話。伊們都是道地的城裏小姐，是穆羅茶妹妹的同學，我門都是熟人，我們便也不　　地參加談話；卽景生情，不知不覺大家沒到城隍廟裏通宵達旦的百貨市塲，和燒頭香一類的事情上去。</p>
<p>剛把想到城隍廟去的心思便出來，穆羅茶第一個即說：「我並不反對參加這種民衆的盛會，但是我怕給呌化子包圍，如其你們有興緻去軋熱閙，還是等到天亮的時候俱去吧。」</p>
<p>我們本是無可無不可的，並不一定要去趕那夜市。終於臨時改變計劃，一行五人，從照耀若白畫的西門，一路散步向霞飛路去。</p>
<p>午夜的時分，我們已經圍坐在呂班路口「新夏威夷」半夜舞塲的小桌邊了。</p>
<p>外面風很大一個身材高大的司閽黑人，穿了厚大衣守在門後。室内却是另一個世界，爐子裏的火燒得很溫煖，四週又完全是熱帶情調的佈置，幾乎使我們忘了是在嚴冬的時期。</p>
<p>屋頂是蔚藍的人工天空，比「黑眼睛」的屋頂裝飾，更有一種淸鮮的感覺；三盞五色圖案彩紋的大燈籠，射出淡淡的光線，彷彿置身東方華麗的宮殿；四壁漆着淡綠和蔚藍的顏色，畫着幾株横斜的棕梠樹，和闊葉的芭蕉；四幅五彩琉璃畫鏡，畫着四個裸體的男女，一幅是伊甸樂園中的夏娃，我們的第一個母親，手裏拿了一隻蘋菓，斜倚在樹枝上，眼睛裏充溢魅誘的表情；靠我們的旧後，畫的是巴黎著名舞女約瑟芬蓓甘，全身赤裸，腰間掛香蕉一串，作婆娑舞狀；靠音樂台的右邊，是一幅檀香山土人奏樂圖，雪白的衣褲，頸裏圍一串花圈，正在彈弄四絃琴；十幾隻小方瞫，平舖白布，上設珊瑚色的花瓶和烟盤，水仙花送來一陣陣幽香，台上幾個樂師，奏着流行的爵士樂曲。</p>
<p>兩位城裏小姐，一坐下來看見背後掛的香蕉舞影，都露出驚奇的喪情，齊聲說道：</p>
<p>「這樣的畫，眞是惡形惡狀，太不雅觀了。」</p>
<p>穆羅茶答道：「你們看，這細幹的棕　梠，闊葉的芭蕉，棕　色皮膚的女人，伊的身體多麽健美，伊赤了脚　，在沙漠裏跳舞，多麽逍遙自然，這是在熱帶地方常可見的，我看畫得很好，一些沒有不雅觀的地方吓！」</p>
<p>白俄侍者過來招待，我們呌了三杯伏特加，二杯咖啡，一瓶上海啤酒。</p>
<p>蕩人心魂的音樂，富於肉感的畫像，爐火的熱氣，咖啡的刺戟力，終於鼓動起了男女們的興緻，一對對在光滑的地板上按步舞蹈。六七年已不跳舞的穆羅茶，一年多不涉足舞塲的黃同志，也先後伴着兩位小姐，同跳華爾姿和狐步舞。</p>
<p>他們一直跳到上午二點多鐘，還是有很濃厚的興緻。我獨自一個人孤單單坐在桌邊，抽了五枝「我的愛人」乾了二杯上海啤酒，傾聽着鄰座的三個德國人，和兩個法國人的談話，他們都是豪興勃發地似乎在討論某種秘密的事件</p>
<p>兩位城裏小姐，因爲要趕到城隍廟裏的親戚家中去吃餛飩圓子，在拂曉三點鐘前，我們走出了熱的「新夏威夷」，在朔風中，三男二女抖簇簇地各奔歸程去了。</p>

<h3 id="c217">怪車夫（英國柴斯特屯作） <a href="#c217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— 侍桁</p>
<p>我遇見奇怪的車夫的那一天，是我同着我的三四個最好的朋友，在梭　的一家小酒店裏小餐遇之笔的事。我的最好的朋友們，不是摸不着邊的懷疑論者，便是完全沒有辦法的信仰家，所以我們小酌時的辯論，轉到那最終極的可怕的思想上去了。而且那全部的辯論糾纏不淸，終想到了這樣：卽，問題是是否一個人根本能夠確實某一件事體呢？我想一個人是可以確定某一件事體的（當我對朋友講着的時候，我曝哮地揮起了一個空瓶子），因爲假若一個人不能理知地認定一種確實，而這種不能認定的確實又是什麽東西呢？假若我從沒有經騐過像確實這樣的一種東西，我甚至不能說一種事體是不確實的。同樣，如果我未曾經騐過綠色這麽一種東西，我便不能說我的鼻子不是綠的。如果我眞的沒有看見過綠色，也許就是極其綠色的了。於是我們彼此對呌起來，震撼了那間屋子；因爲形而上學是一種徹底動情的玩意兒，而且我們之間的意見的不同是非常地深，深到如每逢講起所謂寛宏大量或知能的開展這種整個的東西時一樣的了。因爲我的朋友曾說過，他展開他的知能，如太陽展開一棵棕　樹的葉子，是爲開而開，無限地永遠地開着。但我說我展開我的知能，如我張開我的嘴，是爲着關住某種確實的東西而再來閉上的。恰巧在那時我的嘴正在作着這種工作。而且我熱心地指示出，如果我無限地，永遠地開着我的嘴，那將像是一個怎樣的大傻瓜呢？</p>
<p>×××××</p>
<p>於是當這辯論終結了，或者至少當它切斷了（因爲那是總也不會終結的），我同着我的一個伙伴走出來，這個伙伴在總選舉的混亂和相當的狂妄中，不知怎地變成了一位議員了，於是我同着他坐在一輛馬車裏，從賴賽斯忒的廣塲，跑到衆議院的門口，在那裏警察特别　待地迎接了我。是否警察想，他是我的保護者，還是我是他的保護者呢，這一個辯論在我們之間直到現在還在繼續着。</p>
<p>在這篇叙述中，保持事實的極端的微細是必要的。在議院離開了我的朋友之後，我雇了一輛車到我必要訪問的約隔有數百碼遠的威多力亞街上一家事務所去。於是我跳下車來，給了他格外多的車錢。他看了看錢，却並不像是一般的車夫的那種樣子，使人疑心他是有意乘火打刦。但是這位，不是一個普通的，也許不是一個人性的車夫吧。露着愚笨的小兒似的，顯然非常眞純的驚訝，他看着錢：「你瞧，先生。」他說，「你只給了我一先令八個便士呀。」我略帶驚異地回答他，那我自己是很淸楚的。「可是您曉得，先生，」他溫和，懇求，有望地說，「這不夠從尤斯屯來的車錢哪。」「尤斯屯，」我朦朧地返覆着，因爲這個地名在當時對我像中國和阿拉比亞似地發着嚮。「到底尤斯屯與我們究竟有什麽關係呀？」「您正在尤斯屯車站外邊招呼我的，」那個人露出使人驚異的正確地說，「那時您還說丨」「到底你這傢伙說的是什麽鬼話？」我露着紳士的容忍說。「我從賴賽斯忒廣塲的西角上雇你來的。」「賴賽斯忒！」他呌着，露出一種了不得的輕蔑，「今天我們就沒有到過賴賽斯忒廣塲的邊兒。您正在尤斯屯車站外邊招呼我的，那時您還說丨」「是你瘋了，還是我瘋了呢？」我以科學的冷靜問着他。（未完）</p>

<p>— 彭家煌</p>
<p>傳聞修道者三五年不吃飯，便可成仙。小孩的時候，也曾聽過不吃飯的修道者的故事，說是修道者年年月月盤坐在路邊一個木籠裏，木籠祇有一個供人獻納香火之資的小圓洞，人無論如何不能從小洞裏出進，孩子和好厅的人們常去窺探，總看見修道者不吃飯，活着在那裏，雖然後來在人們忘記之中，那修道者不見了，但不吃飯成仙是千眞萬確的。</p>
<p>據我所知，西洋人也不大吃飯，不過却愛吃麵包牛肉鷄蛋之類。我國北方人也不大吃飯，可是得吃大麫，窩窩頭，饅頭餑餑之類，沒有這些東西吃就吃樹皮，黃土，弄得樹皮黃土也沒有吃，然後纔肯去做仙人。</p>
<p>聽說近代西歐發明了一種人，不吃飯，也不成仙，且能做俗人所做的事，不過要吃一點兒電。</p>
<p>至於中國呢，不讓西歐專美，近年來也發明了一種人，旣不肯成仙，又不愛吃樹皮黃土，要吃飯，偏沒有飯吃，成羣結隊，由這兒湧到那兒，暴動滋事，總愛鬧得有飯吃的人不高興，不安靜。最後，人們給他們吃着「押解出境」，這之後於是那地方太平了！</p>
<p>到了另一塊地方又怎麽辦呢？自然𠶭，他們還是吃着「押解出境」，最後吃着「押解出世界」，繞了許多圈子，結果還是成了仙了！</p>
<p>芸芸衆生，從呱呱墮地時起，就應看破紅塵，修道成仙，那末，這個天下纔會太平。這個天下，纔是我們要吃飯而沒有飯吃的人，所日夕夢想着的天國。</p>
<p>「上帝呵，仁慈的主，請你大開天國之門吧！」</p>
<h3 id="c219">向前進的婦女 <a href="#c219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— 劍風</p>
<p>從前的人每以爲婦女祇好做男子的玩具，除此以外就别無所用了；就是社會學的創始者孔德也說男子應當養女人，換句話說，就是女子在經濟上無論如何是沒有獨立的能力的。但是近年來像法國的居理夫人對於化學上的貢獻·亞洛夫人在金融界和新聞界所有的權威，俄國科倫泰女士在外交界的活動，最近英國的阿英瓊森女士在航空界所造成的光榮的新紀錄·這些事實已把從前蔑視女性的錯誤觀念打得體無完膚了。女子祇要肯努力，無論在學術方面或在一般工作方面，可以說差不多與男子有同等能力。</p>
<p>俄國的婦女在十月革命之前·也像世界其他各國的婦女一樣處於被壓迫的地位，然而革命成功之後，她們的地位驟然提高了，絕不是歐美其他各國的婦女所能　　　背的。英·美·法·德·西，瑞，諸國的婦女對於女子的選舉權和被選舉權的運動，不知道經了多少艱難奮鬥，但是她們所要求的自由平等並沒有完全獲得。俄國婦女對於參政權運動以前雖不像　美各國的婦女那樣熱烈，然而她們反得到了實際平等的參政機會。一九一七年十月革命爆發的當時，曾宣言要給與一般民衆以平等；於是，廢除了性的差别，無論男子，女子，大家共同分擔工作，結果在任何方面，女子都得了公平的分配，她們與男子可以說差不多是處於同等的地位了。</p>
<p>列寗曾這樣說過：當佔全國人口半數的女子還被束縛在廚房裏的時候，無論如　，國民是不能說完全得到了自由的。因此變革後的俄國婦女對於家務的處理與法蘭西婦女正正相反：在今日的俄國，關於吃飯是設有公共的廚房，而雇用善於烹調的廚子在處理；洗濯則設有公共的洗衣　，用着最新式的洗衣機器，雇用專門職工從事：做母親的人在分娩後，把嬰兒交付託兒所的保姆去養育，不必自己日夜辛勞。這樣一來，一般婦女便有多餘的時間去求　識，並可以積極地去參加圖謀社會進步的工作了。在俄國，家庭生活對於婦女的職業是不會妨礙的。婦女現在已得了機會的均等，凡是做同樣的工作，男女都一律得同樣的工資。男的女的各選最適合於他們自己的職業去操作，所以女子不必依賴丈夫的經濟上的帮助。當然，女子因爲生理上的關係，有許多過於笨重的工作，是不能夠做的。</p>
<p>其次，我們就政治行政方面來觀察，無論什麽地位都有婦女參加其間：她們都有辦事的實在能力。俄國全國的主要統治機關裏面，女子佔着百分之八。像科倫泰女士在外交界活動的手腕和她所負的聲譽，是世人所知道的；俄國婦女裏面，還有許多像她那樣具有才能的人。根據一九二六年的調查，俄國女子當裁判官的計有百四十六人，女子檢事有二十人，至近年來又增加了不少。從電氣事業以至各種事業都有婦女參加其間，婦女職業的戰線是一天一天擴張的。</p>
<p>在敎育方面，一切大學裏面的男女學生均亨着平等的權利，似將駕歐美其他各國的大學而上之，這點是歐美其他各國的大學生所羨慕不已的。俄國的婦女决不是希望幾個女子佔着高位置或出出風頭而已的，她們的最高目的是在促進整個社會的發展；她們之所以日夜操作孜孜不已者，也就是爲着這點。高爾基曾說過，俄國並不是以物質的完成爲最後的目的，此外，還要建設健全的精神文化。俄國的婦女們現正在與男子共同努力向這條路勇敢地前進，以期貫澈她們所抱的理想。</p>

<p>— 問鵑女士</p>
<p>東邊兩府圓頂的房屋，建築得更爲精緻的是理學院和工學院的院址，圓形的大譜堂上陳列着不少的試騐用具。圖書館和敎室，也比文學院寛敞得多。我們走馬看花似的看到了這裏，對於學府的外貌，不覺起了一種欽慕之心。可是這莊嚴的道貌，總敵不過東湖柔媚秋波的魔力，使我們不得不捨了武大而跑到東湖的身邊來；湖裏的水淸得眞是可愛，又平靜又澄潔，秋日的天空沒有她的娟秀，美人的妙目沒有她的多情，她有永不衰老的靑春，純凈無疵的心性，渺渺的暮烟，給她遮上了一層輕柔的面幕，婷婷的帆影，給她繪出了潔白而纖巧的靈魂。這時候正是晚霞照水，暮靄蒼茫的時候，她的顏色，微微現出一些模糊的紅暈和淡靑色的幻影來。白烟推着那水際天光漸行漸遠，而落日的光輝又代替以前的景象，替湖波搽上了一抹臙脂了。於是乎暮烟織入雲影裏，白鷗又織入平靜的天空，分不出水與天，紅紫與淡靑的界線來，可是這一切的點染，一切的幻化，都爲了這湖心的笑過微展便失掉了自己的面目，消失到無何有之鄕，這片澄潔的處女心田，依然恢復她本來的皎潔不受絲毫影響。</p>
<p>西望落日，已由深黃而變成殷紅了，這渾然的圓圓的一輪，傲然獨立在浩渺的空間，在她的上面是光明的靑空，沒有一片　雲，擋住她的去路，在她下面的是靑蓮色的一環烟霧，正在等待她的光輝的照耀，可以造成她的粉紅色的前途，可是這美麗的火球的四周，已築起了一條薄薄的圍籬，似乎不願把光明分給别人了！下面洪山的一抹微痕，和那莽蒼蒼的暮色一同捧著這殷紅的落日，渺渺然停立在西邊的天際，那神秘的光輝，微妙的顏色，······「卽使弗羅倍爾復生，怕也不能拿最適當的唯一的字句來形容牠的萬一吧」？Ｃ君說着微微嘆一口氣。</p>
<p>年輕的Ｎ和Ｈ，他們看我們這樣留戀風景，她象有點氣悶了。便說「這裏離卓刀泉很近，我們何不去玩玩，馬上走，時候還來得及。」</p>
<p>我也欣然答應了。不過在動身以後，我的心又覺得遲疑起來，可是終已走到一半，要不去也已不可能了。</p>
<p>沿路折了幾朶野茶花，那白色的花瓣，還殘留著往日的丰神，我把她珍重地挿進了衣襟上，穿過了幾處松林，可惜那天沒有風，不能一聽松濤的幽韻，但見綠沉沉的濃蔭滿地，古樹參天，是珞珈山林木最茂的塲所。</p>
<p>「這一帶很好，只是綠得太憂鬰些，有點像哈代的小詩，美麗和悲哀混合在一起的」Ｃ君靜靜地說，他是長於外國文學的人，所以一開口，就總有外國作家的名字流出口來。</p>
<p>我們正說著，前邊Ｎ和Ｈ二君，已經連跑帶跳地跳遇石牌坊了。（未完）</p>

<p>「那樣的銷金窟，我們當學生的人怎麽好去呢？」</p>
<p>對她抗議的理由是頗堂皇冠冕的。他想，這樣地、拒絕，一來可以獲得她的同情，二來可以掩飾自己的各嗇。</p>
<p>「不要緊，逢塲作戲，」個月中去得一兩回，不算什麽吧······啊唷，我眞想去頑頑喲！」</p>
<p>最後她撤嬌般的說了。她還告訴他，曾炳垣敎授在上海時，每星期六一定帶她到跳舞塲去一回。不然，不能更新他倆間的愉快的感情。</p>
<p>「林先生，走吧。我做你的Partnei好吧？」</p>
<p>他說了後，又嘻嘻地笑了起來。</p>
<p>「························」</p>
<p>他表示着躊躇不决的神氣。</p>

<p>出路者，死裏求生的光明要徑，末路者，乃任意狂奔，不　得失，直入地獄的黑暗䆳道，天地之間，這兩條大路：無處不是並列平行着。世人不察，盲然前進，幸則登彼樂土，不幸即誤墮地獄，險哉兩路，須要及早認淸。</p>
<p>稽古證今，東西兩半球上無論個人的生活與事業，或者國家民族的興衰和存亡，凡遇一種問題當前，均以立刻判别出路與末路爲先决條件？有了先决條件，方有結果勝利的希望，否則，火燒眉毛，且顧眼下，一味因循糊塗幹下去，將來不獨勝利的結果不到，簡直連生存的希望都沒有把握。</p>
<p>讀者諸君，切勿懐疑我的說話近於武斷，試問民國初年袁世凱：如果不走到家天下的末路上去？他非但不得遺臭萬年，並能名垂竹帛，與美國華盛頓先後此美，還有近來那班輕生鴻毛的自殺同胞們，尤爲可惜，他們輕生的原因，固我皆是覺悟本身，走入歧途無法挽回的緣故，但個人誤入歧途，仍可别尋生趣，並非非死不可的，假使某一個國家民族，錯行了政策和主義，以致走入歧途末路，那可定有亡國之禍。例如歐戰前的德意志，要不做武力侵略的迷夢，何至衰落到目下這種地步呢？依據這些先例，我可證明前淸的餘孽丨宣統丨鄭孝胥等，正在那兒趨入黑暗地獄的䆳道，日本也是急要嘗試歐戰後的德國辛辣的滋味。</p>
<p>現在我們的國難緊急，危如疊卵，到底那一條路可走呢？我已認淸了「出關」！更以十二萬分的誠意，奉勸準備自殺的同胞們，勿作無味犧牲，貪汚土劣，勿再專飽私襄，新舊軍閥，勿再盲目私鬥·綠林匪共·勿再任意搗亂，黨國要人，勿再各懐己見，統兵大員，勿再因循膽怯，大家抱定「寗爲玉碎，不爲瓦全」的主義丨即日動員，大槍也好，小槍也好，靑龍偃月刀也好，殺鷄的牛刀也好，一齊集合起來，共同殺出關去丨丨和敵人拚個你死我活丨將來就是不幸，陣亡在那天然大冰箱般的關外地方？相信我們的骨頭，也可多保全幾時不朽丨不達還我失地目的，誓不終止丨這樣辦法，綫是中華民族求生存的唯一康莊出路。</p>
<p>不然，苟仍謬執「先安内，後攘外」的偏見？敢斷其内未安，而國先亡矣。</p>

<p>— 枕木</p>
<p>（五）電木（Bakelite）</p>
<p>電木，因爲這是一種不傳電的物質，常用之於電氣器具上；又因爲牠的質地堅靱，又輕又易於雕刻，很像木頭，故有這個名字。究其實在，牠是一種化學工業的產物，牠的原料，以一碳酸爲主體，而輪質，硫璜，硫酸，石炭酸等輔之；可以做成各種的花紋，各種的顏色。牠的性質，除掉不導電，堅靱之外，還有跌不碎，甩不破的好處；雖然，一碰到火，那是牠唯一的尅星，也就是燬滅的機會了。牠的用途，極爲普遍，電氣用具上的附件，自來水筆的筆桿，其他的擺飾，日用器具等，都是需要着電木的。</p>
<p>（六）鋼精</p>
<p>市上出售，有一種銀灰色光亮的金屬日用器具，如打氣爐上的鑊子，鏟刀，以及飯鍋，飯碗，鏡框；等物，都是這種料子，普通呌作鋼精；到底這是什麽東西呢，牠幷不是鋼，更何精之有；牠是另外一種金屬丨丨鈤丨丨澆成的；鈤的比重地二，七，在金屬中可算是很輕的了，富於展性，可以壓成極薄的薄片，而且熔點的高在攝氏六百五十度以上，這也就是所以取牠來製造日用傢具的優點。對於牠更有一層保護的物質，氧化鋁（Al2O3）塗蓋浮面上，因了這層氧化鋁，在裏邊的鋁可以不致被空氣氧化或侵蝕，而在外表上則形成了光亮的銀灰色，旣美觀又耐用，是誠科學的大功。不過在諸位運用的時候，千萬要小心，不要煑放含食鹽過多的食物，因爲食鹽是很易容的溶解於水中，在大量的時候，起化學作用而生成苛性鈵，鹽酸，苛性鎂，等，這都是最强烈的物質可以侵蝕氧化鋁以至於中間的鋁，而且所用的鋼精器具，往往是極薄的一層鋁箔；因此時常有人家的飯鍋，菜鑊等被侵蝕而參漏，這是鋼精的一件毛病。</p>
<p>（七）鉛粉（Chalk）</p>
<p>銅粉，又名白堊，學校裏是必不可少掉牠的，其化學名字呌碳酸鈣，爲石灰的水深液和碳酸的化合物。這雖是極簡單的一件化學作用，但是因了科學條件的關係，製造起來規模也不小到怎樣的。銅粉除作黑板上寫之外，因爲牠具有極大的吸水能力，學校裏的學生們，很多用牠來代替吸墨水紙，諸位不信，一試便知定不誤也。</p>
<p>（八）金剛石（Caarbonrundum）</p>
<p>金鋼鑽的炭的結晶，金剛石是炭的化合物，也不是金金剛的，其做法用一只阻力電爐，在兩極的中間，放了一層層的砂和炭屑，當電流通過的時候，因阻力而發生巨大的高溫度熱量，於是砂（二氧化矽）和炭，受熱而化合成此種金剛石，她的公式是Sfo牠是是極堅硬的一件東西，普通店家劃玻璃小粒，即是此項金剛石的微料；牠的粉末，若混以别種黏性物件，可以放到樣型中去做出，金工廠中必不可無的磨石，所以這也是極有用的一件商品，牠還件好處，不像金鋼鑽一般，遇火即化的，牠是火爐中的產物，些須小火，牠是幷不懼怕的，諸位儘可隨便放置，不必爲牠躭心吊胆！</p>

<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>現在我有一件很難解决的事情，告訴你；請你明白指敎。事情是這樣的：我家裏的房子是自己的：因爲太大了，所以召了幾個房客。内中有一家姓王的丨和我們有一點很疏遠的親戚關係丨他們只有母女二人；母年四十左右，女年才十七歲；他們的男主人早已去世了。在我們家裏住了好多年；我沒有出來做生意之前，天天住在家裏，同這女子做伴，所以雙方竟發生了愛情。在她十五歲的那年，並且同她發生了肉體關係。彼時雙方情意緾綿，滿想「有情人終成眷屬」的。現在我有了生意，不得不離開她。不料她竟一改從前的品性。一天到晚，跑在外面；而且十天之中，終有六七天，連晚上都住在外面；看她的行藏，好像另外有了情人。我上次回去勸她，她仍舊勿聽；並且耳聞現在更不好了。所以我寫信給她，要與她絕交；那裏曉得她的回信說，「一定要與我結婚，如其不允許，要同我法律解决，或者要自殺」。</p>
<p>編者先生：我是絕對不願意同她結</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>婚了，而且我的父母，也不能同意這段婚事了。但是同她絕交後，他如其訴之法庭，我是否要照强好未成年女子的規條論罪？或者她不訴之法庭而果眞自殺，那末她的母親，當然也要了首告我·那末我的罪又怎樣呢？請你明白告訴，而且要指敎我自處的辦法。末了我還得聲明，我是比她長九歲。（下略）</p>
<p>陳夢樵謹上</p>
<p>○○○</p>
<p>編　按：讀了陳君的來信，我們對於他目下心弦上的痛苦，非常諒解。但是費了許久的研究，終覺得於法於情，竟一點找不出理由來原諒他。我們且把他的事實，在法律上與道德上的觀察點，詳述於後：希望陳君能心平氣和地想一想，去承受他自自所種惡因的果報。同時希望一般在歧途中的靑年，趕快覺悟。不要逞一時的衝動，任性妄爲，致自食其報；那就不辜負我們發表這段通訊的原意了。</p>
<p>㈠法律上的觀察丨當陳君與王女發生肉體關係時，王女士年才十五，而陳君則已二十有四歲了。所以雖則因爲出於對方同意的緣故，不至成立「强姦未滿十六歲女子」的「加重强姦罪」；但確已構成了「和姦未滿十六歲女子」的「準强姦罪」，依法應處七年以上有期徒刑。幸虧這是一種親告罪；除非王女士或其母親出首告訴，法律可以原諒不問。現在假令取消婚約，（雖未正式訂婚，但彼此口頭的意思表示，法律上也認爲婚約的）無論王女士的不貞行爲，無從證實；即使有了眞憑實據，也只能成立取消婚約的條件，萬不能因此而可將犯姦的責行卸去。所以一旦因爲解約的緣故，觸怒了對方·當然會立刻告發；那時陳君就要預備至少過七年的牢獄生活了。萬一對方因此　憤自殺，那就更糟了。因爲法律早已預備好這麽一條，說「因犯强姦罪，致被害人羞憤自殺者，處十五年以上有期徒刑」。恭候你的光顧啊！</p>
<p>㈡道德上的觀察丨王女士的是否另有情人，我們以爲不能因爲她時常在外過宿，就武斷她爲不貞。就王女士堅持要嫁給陳君的事實看來，更覺得王君不免神經過敏。總之沒有眞憑實據，是不能說的。即使退一步而言，作爲王女士的確有這種行爲；那這也是陳君自己的不是「人之初，性本善」，王女士這種不良習慣，原因還種在陳君第一次破壤她貞操的時候呢！</p>
<p>我們也深知愛情是不能同時容納一個人以上的，所以配偶雙方對於對方的獨占思想，認爲是不差的。但是在結婚前對方的貞操，似乎可以從寛。只須在結婚後，沒有第三者攙入，就行了。定要娶處女爲妻子，也未免回執。基上理由，陳君似可與王女士結婚。倘使結婚後，發現她仍與其他情人，斷續不斷地發生關係，再提出離婚，也未始不可。</p>

<p>— 汪仲賢</p>
<p>㈥良心被天狗星吃掉了</p>
<p>在南海到上海的茫茫大海中，一條五千噸的大商輪，滿載了旅客和洋貨，衝開了深藍色的海水，開足了馬力鼓輪前進，輪船的尖銳龍頭劃破了海的平面，一路前進，船頭兩邊湧起了兩道潔白如雪的波浪，好像永遠依附着輪船前進似的，還有一大羣白鷗，簇擁着大輪船，晝夜不息的跟隨着，好像是怕旅客們長途寂寞，特地追隨着來做海上的良伴，悶處在船艙中的旅客，在這海闊天空的環境中，愈覺得人類生命的渺小，脫離了這艘輪船，立刻就要變作九死一生的魯濱孫，看了這一羣忽而翱翔天空，忽而浮沈波心的海鷗，都會與「我不如他們」的幻想，</p>
<p>那時適在傍晚，太陽已經隱沒在水平線下，東天已黑暗如漆，惟有太陽沒落處，尙留着一片黃色的　光，反映在海面上，還能幻作幾道金蛇，蠕蠕地舞動，在甲板上觀落日的旅客也陸續下艙，只有駕駛橋後凹進處的一張籐榻上，還躺着一個秀髮吹得凌亂蓬鬆的時髦女子，籐椅的靠手上坐着一個美貌少年，他們都穿着毛布的睡衣，他用身子擋她的臉，怕海風把她吹壞了，同船的人見他們喁喁私語，十分親熱，都道他們是新婚的一對，正度着蜜月旅行的快樂生活，誰知他們竟是嫡親的叔嫂呵！</p>
<p>天地良心，夏幼中做夢不曾想到，自己會昩了良心去侵佔哥哥的愛人，無奈艾若華女十蓄心已久，她一向體貼入微的伺候着幼中，幼中以爲祷是做嫂子的特别賢慧，决不會存一點非份之想，豈知到了船上，她竟把態度完全表現出來，當幼中很擔心的與她商量着營救仲南的時候，她竟漠不關心的說：</p>
<p>「這是他自作孽，不可活！」</p>
<p>幼中驚訝道：「他是你的丈夫，你怎麽能說這種話呢？」</p>
<p>若華懶洋洋地說：「這種惡而蠻的丈夫，有也罷，無也罷！只要你不牽涉在内，别人，誰也不在我的心上，」她說罷，用俏眼睛對他一眇，接着就是嫣然一笑，百媚俱生，嚇得幼中半天沒有敢開口，她的愛火燃燒了，再也無法遏止，便把以前愛慕他的心事完全說了出來，幼中懷着鬼胎似的說道：</p>
<p>「我不是不愛你，只是不敢存這種壞心思，因爲我的年紀還輕，以後要在社會上去做些事業，同你發生了戀愛，是不名譽的事，被哥哥知道，果然是不得了，就是瞞過了他，被外人知道，我的人格也就掃地了！將來怎能夠立身於社會呢？」</p>
<p>若華用纖指向他額上點了一下，然輾一笑：「你眞是一個小孩子，性不得人家要說你是傻子咧丨這個年月，祇要有錢，那裏不能吃飯？講耶穌道理的傳敎師，最有人格，每月祇掙二十塊錢！販賣仇貨的奸商，殺人放火的軍閥，包庇烟土的流氓，首鼠兩端的政客，刮　地皮的贓官，還有種種喪盡廉恥的東西，他們都是毫無人格的人，但是他們腰裏有錢，到處都受人家的歡迎，誰敢說他們半句不是？現在是黃金萬能的世界，失了人格，只要有黃金，就能把人格買回來，沒有錢，不能做人，沒有人格，照樣能夠做大官發大財，你見誰因爲喪失了人格被人看輕過了呢？何况自由戀愛是光明正大的事，現在的一等闊人，和一等時髦太太，有幾對是經過三媒六證的花燭夫妻呵？」</p>
<p>幼中被她一頓搶白，說得頓口無言，痴痴的望着她，毫無表示，若華托着他下·問道：</p>
<p>「小把戲，主意打定了沒有？」</p>

<p>The Nineteenth Committee to Reopen Discussions Today on Drafting Suggestions</p>
<p>Matsuoka Hints to Drummond at New Amendments Seeking Final Reversal</p>
<p>There is Talk of the United States Convening a Conference of Signatories to the Kellogg-Briand Pact</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Diplomatic sources report that the Committee of Nineteen, due to the inability of the Committee of Nine to undertake the responsibility of drafting the suggested portions of the report, is scheduled to meet on the morning of the 4th at 10:00 AM. It is expected that there will be two avenues for drafting: (1) The Committee of Nineteen will automatically draft the report; (2) The Committee of Nine will still draft the report, but the Committee of Nineteen will instruct its scope. Regardless of the method adopted, if it does not explicitly state non-recognition of the puppet organization, then the serious deadlock will not be broken in the end. (Central News Agency dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Committee of Nineteen and other relevant parties now share a feeling that the step towards Article 15, Paragraph 4 of the Covenant is now unavoidable. Ultimately, a report will be issued, explaining the facts of the dispute and the recommendations deemed fair and appropriate by the Executive Yuan. The Committee of Nineteen will meet tomorrow to consider the new Japanese proposal submitted by the Japanese representative Matsuoka to League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond on Wednesday. It is now confirmed that the new Japanese proposal makes final concessions on the wording of the final section of the explanatory memorandum. However, public opinion remains pessimistic, and it is generally believed that the reconciliation process has come to an end, and prolonging discussions on procedure will not help. According to a senior figure in the Committee of Nineteen, the Committee will likely discuss its recommendations on Sunday, finalize the text of the recommendations on Thursday, and then convene the League of Nations General Assembly. The Assembly may convene on February 13th. However, if Mr. Vechy, who is familiar with the situation, has not yet recovered from his illness, this progress may need to be changed. There is now a strong impression that the recommendations will not only endorse the Lytton Report, but also have adjudicatory implications. There are rumors that the United States plans to convene a conference of signatories to the Kellogg-Briand Pact when this report is established. However, reliable sources here do not readily believe that the United States has such a plan. It is generally expected that if the report of the Committee of Nineteen aligns with the views of the United States, then the United States will support it. Otherwise, the United States may not take any action. (Reuters dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>The League of Nations Distributes Puppet Documents</p>
<h3 id="e2">Our Representative Lodges Protest <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Chinese delegation has recently submitted an official document to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, protesting the publication of a communication from the so-called "Manchukuo." It stated that the Chinese delegation had notified the League of Nations on November 19th of last year that Japanese personnel in Manchuria had fabricated various declarations, purporting them to be the will and hope of the entire people to support "Manchukuo," which would be sent to Geneva. The fact that the Japanese delegation requested the distribution of "Manchukuo" documents shows that the previous notification by the Chinese delegation has been beneficial to the truth of the matter. The protest also stated that Mr. Bronson Ray, an American, who presides over the publication of the "Far Eastern Times," clearly favors Japan. It would be beneficial for the League of Nations to be aware of this. (Havas dispatch, 3rd)</p>

<p>Gu Weijun Visited Hymans Yesterday</p>
<p>Please Pay Attention to This Point in the Report</p>
<p>(Geneva) Our representative Gu visited Mr. Hymans, Chairman of the Committee of Nineteen today, strongly arguing that boycott is a peaceful retaliatory measure for weak nations against aggressors. The boycott before September 18th arose from the brutal massacre of overseas Chinese in Seoul by the Japanese. He also said that the judgment in the Lytton Report is so gentle and weak because it wants to leave room for mediation. Now that mediation has failed, it should be requested that special attention be paid to the point that boycott is a peaceful means for weak nations when drafting the report to the General Assembly.

However, it is expected that this meeting may still not be able to take final action, as British Foreign Secretary Simon is currently in London, waiting for Ambassador to the US, Lindsay, to return home. His return date to Geneva is yet to be determined. Although Lindsay's return home is mainly to discuss war debt issues, it is believed that he will also report on America's mood regarding the Manchurian issue and the official attitude of the US government.

<p>(Geneva) Japanese Representative Matsuoka Yosuke visited Secretary-General Drummond at the Secretariat at 0:40 AM today, personally delivering the final Japanese amendment and conferring secretly with Drummond for quite some time. It is reported that Drummond agreed to Matsuoka's request to make one last effort to forcefully pressure the smaller nations through the power of Britain and France, preventing the application of Article 15, Paragraph 4, and to resolve the situation with Paragraph 3 as a means of reconciliation. (China United Press dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Japanese delegation is now rushing to draft a final proposal for negotiations with the League of Nations, which clearly expresses the final limits to which the Japanese government can concede, and slightly modifies previous proposals. Representative Matsuoka met with Drummond at noon, but the proposal was not yet drafted. Therefore, Deputy Minister Sugimura will personally present it to Drummond to begin negotiations. Sugimura plans to meet with Drummond every day from the afternoon of the 2nd to continue negotiations. At the same time, Drummond himself seems to be contacting the Committee of Nineteen to conduct consultations. (Japan United Press dispatch, 3rd)</p>

<p>Rumors Abound in Geneva:</p>
<p>Lampson Facilitating Direct Negotiations</p>
<p>(London) In light of the various messages currently being disseminated by China, the British officialdom has reiterated today that Britain continues to use the Lytton Report as the basis of its policy on the Sino-Japanese dispute. The rumor that Britain and Japan had an understanding when the Japanese army occupied Shanghai, with Britain agreeing to aid Japan on the Manchurian case in exchange for the withdrawal of Japanese troops from Shanghai, is completely unfounded. British officials also stated today that British representatives in Geneva have not exerted pressure on other delegations in order to remove the section of the report that does not recognize "Manchukuo." (Reuters dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) A local newspaper claims that British Minister to China, Lampson, has proposed to the Chinese authorities to hold a round-table conference in order to seek direct negotiations between China and Japan. This statement cannot be verified in any way, and general public opinion believes that this statement is completely unfounded. (Reuters dispatch, 3rd)</p>

<p>Japanese Political and Military Authorities Decide on Countermeasures for Leaving the League</p>
<p>Participating in Disarmament to Avoid Responsibility</p>
<p>Not Abandoning Mandated Territories in the South Seas</p>
<p>(Geneva) One faction among the smaller nations in the League of Nations holds the view that if Japan wishes to withdraw, it should be allowed to withdraw without being prevented. Therefore, most of the influential national representatives are pessimistic about the possibility of reconciliation. The atmosphere in Geneva today is quite gloomy. The reason why the smaller nations are acting in this way is because they do not want Japan to obtain the position of Chairman of the Council in the seventy-first regular session in May next year, which Japan should obtain according to the order. Therefore, they would rather Japan withdraw. (Dentsu dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) As a result of discussions between the Japanese Foreign Ministry and the military, the principles that Japan will adhere to even if it withdraws from the League of Nations in the future are as follows: (1) Japan will continue to abide by League of Nations obligations for two years after withdrawal; (2) Japan will continue to pay its share of the 2 million yen in expenses; (3) Japan will still participate in the disarmament conference to avoid the responsibility of failure in disarmament; (4) The right to govern the South Seas Islands is a militarily important location for operations against the United States and cannot be easily returned.

<p>(Jinan) The Provincial Party Headquarters today telegraphed the British government, stating that since the rise of the Northern Expeditionary Army, your country has provided much assistance to our revolutionary army, returning the Hankou and Weihai concessions, and friendship has grown. Since the Mukden Incident, Sir Cecil has especially advocated for justice, which our people deeply appreciate. However, since Simon continued to attend the League of Nations, he has sided with violent Japan, leading to major regrets in Sino-British relations. The indignation of our people has reached its peak. If this continues, it will not only be intolerable by international justice, but also not in the best interests of your country. How should things be changed? We hope your government will carefully consider this. (Special Telegram, 3rd)</p>

However, he said that the war in Jehol is feared to become a prairie fire. Zhang was unwilling to talk much about the current situation in the area. In response to questions about the relocation of the treasures from the Forbidden City, he said that the purpose of the southward relocation was purely for prevention. He also stated that, in his personal opinion, there was not much danger in keeping them in Peiping. (Reuters dispatch, 3rd)</p>

<p>1. Accumulated reported amount for debts established after 1930 with completed deliveries of goods is more than 7.11 million Japanese yen. 35% of this amount in cash (approximately 2.5 million Japanese yen) will be paid to the creditors in the accounting year of Datong 1 (1932). 20% in cash (approximately 1.5 million Japanese yen) will be paid in the Datong 2 (1933) accounting year. The remaining amount will be paid with public bonds redeemable in 20 years with an annual interest rate of 3%.

<p>(Peiping) Chengde reports that after Chaoyang Temple was retaken by the Yijun Geng Jizhou's unit, more than 500 soldiers from the Japanese army Sanjian Zheng's unit retreated to Jinjiao Temple. The entire Japanese 8th Division was transferred from Suizhong to Jinjiao Temple for reinforcement. The counterattack against the Yijun began on the 1st. Zhu Jiqing's unit has rushed to a certain location. Japanese planes have been bombing the South Ridge of Chaoyang every day for the past two days. Five trains of Chen Guorui's rebel army came from Jinzhou and arrived in Suizhong yesterday, and there is a force advancing from Lingnan Yaowang Temple towards Jinjiao Temple. Recently, a large number of Japanese troops have been transferred from Shenyang, some of whom disembarked from Shenyang to Tongliao and went to Kailu Fuxin, and some of whom transferred to Jinzhou, Chaoyang, and Qian and arrived in Suizhong to attack Chaoyang, Jianping, and Lingnan. (Special Telegram, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Peiping) The Japanese 7th Heavy Artillery Regiment crossed the Yalu River from Korea on the 30th and transferred to the Fushun Road via Andong, heading towards Suizhong and Tongliao, planning to advance to the Kailu and Tongliao area. The Japanese plan for Zhang Hai Peng and Yu Zhishan's troops to be responsible for attacking Kailu Fuxin, and for Chen Guorui and Lü Xueqing's troops to be responsible for attacking Chaoyang and Jianping. (Special Telegram, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Chaoyang Temple is the enemy's frontline headquarters for the attack on Jehol. Commander Kato leads more than 500 Japanese soldiers with 4 cannons and 6 machine guns stationed there. Recently, the Japanese army has increased the number of Japanese and puppet soldiers near Jinxi by about 400 each, with 8 aircraft. It seems that a large part of the Japanese army is concentrated in the rear. Many automobile roads in western Liaoning, Tongliao, and Jehol have not yet been completed. Yu Zhishan's troops have one regiment each in Yixian Xinlitun and Heitun. The puppet national army of Ding Qiang has about 5,000 soldiers in Goubangzi and Jinxi. The Japanese army garrison at Dahu Mountain has 800 soldiers, with Commander Nagata. The Japanese army in Yixian has recently increased by about 700 to 800 soldiers. There are three armored trains of enemy troops traveling back and forth between Jinzhou and Yixian every day. (Special Telegram, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Peiping) The Japanese recruited more than 1,000 Chinese people in Tougou Village, more than ten miles north of Yixian, issued them with guns, and transferred them to Xinlitun, intending to use them as the vanguard for the attack on Jehol. Zhang Xiantao's infantry and cavalry, about three brigades, marched to the Xinlitun area, claiming to suppress bandits. (Special Telegram, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Peiping) The Yijun Wang Yuannian Division and Geng Jizhou's unit joined forces and retook Daheishan. On January 28th, they occupied Liulongtai Sanbaoyingzi, killing more than 30 puppet soldiers. Japanese instructors fled without a trace. The Yijun Independent Regiment Shao Yin Fan, Liang Chao Ding, and Zhang Xin dispatched troops from Chuanxindian and are currently joining forces with the Li Brigade in a certain location, progressing towards Jin County. Because the Yijun's momentum is growing daily, each board of the Lian Zhuang Association is willing to provide assistance. (Special Telegram, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Peiping) The Japanese army concentrated in Suizhong has reached more than 5,000 soldiers. It is said that because the Jehol border is tense, a large army will be concentrated in Suizhong as a suitable location to support all parties. The Japanese army at Chaoyang Temple fought fiercely with the Yijun yesterday. At the same time, the Japanese army in Nanling attacked our Koubeiyingzi position and the fierce fighting lasted for one hour before the enemy retreated. The enemy suffered heavy casualties and our side also suffered losses. It is heard that the Japanese army intends to launch a large-scale attack on Beipiao, so the Jinzhou-Chaoyang line is tense again. (Special Telegram, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Peiping) According to reliable news from Shenyang, the Japanese army is currently advancing along the Beining Railway towards Jinzhou and will begin the offensive within a few days to take Jehol. However, there are currently many Chinese troops in Jehol who are guarding natural fortresses to resist the enemy, so it will not be easy for the Japanese army to drive straight into Jehol. However, the Japanese army has the help of airplanes. It is heard that Japanese airplanes appeared in the sky over Jehol yesterday morning, inspected for a few minutes, and then flew southeast without dropping bombs. (Reuters dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Transportation sources report that the front line is still in a stalemate. There are only small contacts every day. Although the situation in Chaoyang and Kailu feels tense, it is not actually tense, because the enemy has opened up to the Jehol border, and the troops are insufficient for distribution. The enemy now plans to wait and see for a month or two to dissipate our spirit, and then increase its strength to implement the old trick of defeating each one individually.

Landmines were buried around and at the station. Trenches and barbed wire were built on the city walls. Many troops have been added in recent days. Many houses in the city have been occupied. Sentries have been added at the four gates. More than 20 Chinese policemen were shot and killed by Japanese troops a few days ago. Residents who show any resistance are killed miserably.

<p>There Are More Than 20 Divisions of Bandit Suppression Troops in Jiangxi</p>
<p>Chiang's Purpose of Directing the Bandit Suppression Lies in Eliminating the Strength of the Red Bandits</p>
<p>(Nanchang) A senior general talked about more than 20 divisions stationed in the province and entering Jiangxi from neighboring provinces, several independent brigades, one security brigade, and local police teams in each county, with more than 300,000 guns, more than ten times the number of bandits. Chiang's purpose is not to recover a certain place or city, or to defeat the Red Bandits, but to focus on eliminating the bandits' strength. He hopes to fight hard battles. The only worry is that the bandits will retreat to Fujian when Chiang arrives. However, after Chiang arrives, the concept of division, where victories are not shared and defeats are not rescued, can be broken, with unified command, close contact, and simultaneous mobilization with Fujian, Guangdong, and Zhejiang. It is believed that Chiang's determination to clear out the Red Bandits in three months is very confident. (Special Telegram, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) The pseudo 1355 Army Corps and pseudo 22nd Army, which retreated to the Fujian border, suddenly circled back to Jinxi, attempting a desperate gamble. Chiang, seeing the bandits sending themselves to their deaths, ordered Chen Cheng, Wu Qiwai, Sun Lianzhong, Mao Bingwen, Li Yunjie, and Li Mo'an to intercept and attack the bandits' backs. Fierce fighting has occurred between Jin and Zi, with airplanes assisting in the battle, killing many bandits. (Special Telegram, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) Zhang Yougu led the air force to fly to the eastern Jiangxi and Fujian border today to scout and bomb. Because Chiang督 ordered the large army to fight hard, the bandits scattered to zero and fled to Fujian. At the end of last month, 7,000 to 8,000 remaining bandits arrived in Hufang, Lichuan, about 600 to 700 in Xiong Village, and about 8,000 to 9,000 in Heng Village and Zhang Village.

<p>Tian Jiongjin and Others Will File Another Impeachment</p>
<p>Yu Youren Advocates Handling the Case According to Law</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Jiangsu Province Chairman Gu Zhutong's illegal detention of Liu Yusheng, manager of the Zhenjiang Jiangsheng Daily, and resistance to the investigation by the Supervisory Yuan, etc., were impeached by Supervisory Committee members Liu Eqing and Tian Jiongjin, who also requested the Executive Yuan to order the Jiangsu Provincial Government to promptly transfer Liu Yusheng to the court for trial. However, Gu executed Liu Yusheng on January 21, sentencing him to death and carrying out the execution by firing squad according to Article 2, Section 2 of the Emergency Law for Punishing Those Who Endanger the Republic of China. Furthermore, the provincial government's report to the Executive Yuan, explaining the situation, was disclosed in newspapers in Nanjing and Shanghai in recent days. A reporter from a certain newspaper interviewed Committee members Liu and Tian, who stated that the Jiangsu Provincial Government's report to the Executive Yuan regarding the execution of Liu Yusheng was largely filled with sophistry, disregarding the law. Even with extreme sophistry, how could one deceive the people of the world? After the Executive Yuan officially responds, another impeachment will be filed to uphold the law and discipline. (3rd Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain member of the Control Yuan commented on the Liu Yusheng case, stating that the Jiangsu Provincial Government's report to the Executive Yuan contained two main points: first, that Liu Yusheng was found to be a communist and thus sentenced to death according to the Emergency Law for Punishing Those Who Endanger the Republic of China; second, whether the Control Yuan's review of case files could also apply to cases under trial by military organs. Regarding the first point, how Liu Yusheng usually behaved and whether he was a communist is not discussed for the time being. Even if Liu Yusheng was indeed a communist, his crime would at most be in the same category as Niu Lan and Chen Duxiu. Niu Lan and Chen Duxiu still had to be handed over to the court for trial according to law. How can it be said that Liu Yusheng could be shot by the administrative organ without being tried by the court? Regarding the second point, the statement that the Control Yuan cannot investigate cases in which military organs are trying criminals is even more of a disregard for the law. Article 46 of the National Government Organization Law stipulates that the Control Yuan is the (highest) supervisory organ of the National Government, exercising the functions of impeachment and auditing according to law. Furthermore, Article 10 of the Control Yuan Organization Law stipulates that the Control Yuan, in order to exercise its functions, may inquire or review case files and registers from (various government offices) and other public institutions. When there are questions, the responsible personnel should be responsible for providing detailed answers. It is clear that this Yuan has the power of supervision and investigation over any government office and any public institution under the National Government. The legal provisions are extremely clear. Regardless of the fact that the provincial government is not a military organ and the Liu Yusheng case is not a military case, the chairman cannot consider himself outside the bounds of legal sanctions. Even regarding events in military trials, this Yuan has exercised its powers of investigation and inquiry over central and local high-level military organs in many cases, and there are established precedents. The independent power granted to this Yuan by national law will never be expanded by this Yuan, nor can it be reduced by the provincial government. (3rd Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Political Affairs Disciplinary Committee has received more than twenty disciplinary cases. Recently, it has received a total of four impeachment and disciplinary cases filed by the Control Yuan, including the case of Gu Zhutong shooting Liu Yusheng. It was brought up for discussion at Wednesday's meeting and has been submitted for review. After the next meeting, the person to be disciplined, Gu Zhutong, will be sent a written request for a written defense. Then, the original text of the impeachment case and the written defense will be discussed together to determine whether or not disciplinary action should be taken. Furthermore, Yu Youren is extremely saddened by the case of Gu Zhutong shooting Liu Yusheng and advocates handling the case according to law. (3rd Day Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission plans to establish overseas Chinese affairs bureaus in Shanghai, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Shantou, and other places. The organizational law is currently under review. However, overseas passports were originally handled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission argues that the overseas Chinese affairs bureaus should directly issue them to avoid applicants having to travel back and forth and delay the process. The passport fees should also be reduced appropriately. Therefore, the opinions of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission have not been consistent. On the 3rd, Chairman Lin convened Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee Chairman Chen Shuren, Vice Chairman Zhou Qigang, Foreign Minister Luo Wengan, Central Committee member Ma Chaojun, and eight others at the Central Party Headquarters to discuss the matter. In addition to discussing the passport issue, the implementation methods of the overseas Chinese affairs bureaus were also discussed in detail, but no decision was made.

To resolve the Northeast issue, we must first gather our collective wisdom and efforts to carry out a practical restoration movement. At the same time, we must also clearly understand the content of everything in the Northeast, both cultural and material, to prepare for development after restoration. Therefore, the Northeast Association was initiated and formally established yesterday. More than a year after the fall of the Northeast, such an expanded organization for studying the Northeast issue and saving the Northeast has emerged in our country. Although it is said "better late than never," we deeply regret that the timing is late.</p>
<p>The vast territory of the Northeast, spanning thousands of miles, is materially a source of wealth for our country and strategically a shield for our country. Japan has long coveted this rich territory. Before and after the Sino-Japanese War, they diligently studied our Northeast, sparing no effort. The government promoted it from above, and the people worked hard from below. The South Manchuria Railway Company alone publishes no fewer than a hundred books each year on various Northeast-related issues. Even on minor issues such as the commands used by farmers to drive cattle and sheep, there are precise surveys and detailed works. Their investigation and research of the Northeast were extremely thorough, and their knowledge of the Northeast was very clear. Their seizure of our Northeast was like taking something out of a bag. When the curtain of the September 18th Incident was lifted, half of the Northeast's rivers and mountains fell in rapid succession. In contrast, before September 18th, our country, from top to bottom, paid no attention to it, allowing others to dissect and analyze it at will. Even after September 18th, although more people paid attention to this issue and more publications researched this issue, the Northeast was already lost. The time was too late. It is still remembered that when the Wanbaoshan Incident occurred in July of the previous year, this newspaper made an urgent appeal on this issue, detailing the advantages and disadvantages, hoping to arouse the attention of the Chinese people. Alas, the cry of blood and tears ultimately failed to win the attention of the Chinese people.</p>
<p>The loss of the Northeast has been more than a year now. Between the Changbai Mountains and the Heilongjiang River, the violent enemy and the treacherous elements jointly play their victory music. Therefore, we believe that the most urgent issue facing our country today far exceeds studying the Northeast and providing relief to Northeast refugees. It should be about how to take back the Northeast, how to seize back our great rivers and mountains from the hands of the strong enemy. In today's situation of broken rivers and mountains, merely talking about research and relief is not only slow but also harmful, as it may even shift the public's attention and divert their attention, making the recovery of the Northeast even more distant and uncertain.</p>
<p>However, we are not saying that the organization of the Northeast Association is completely meaningless. However, we believe that the Northeast is the lifeline of our country. The loss of the Northeast endangers North China. The upheaval in North China makes our overall situation unstable. Therefore, when we talk about resisting foreign aggression today, we must first take back the Northeast. When we talk about saving the country today, we must first take back the Northeast. When we talk about resolving the Northeast issue today, we must first take back the Northeast. There is no other way. We firmly believe that the final resolution of the Northeast issue is not in Geneva, nor is it in Tokyo, but within our own country. Since the Japanese seized our Northeast with blood and iron, we can only seize our Northeast back with blood and iron. We must concentrate our efforts and make a resolute fight. How to concentrate our efforts and how to make practical preparations for the start of the struggle are the huge responsibilities that the Northeast Association should urgently shoulder without any excuse.</p>
<p>We believe that a nation that is oppressed and trampled upon without a sound will inevitably perish. Conversely, a nation that is oppressed and trampled upon and can rise up to fight will not perish in the end. Now, at the beginning of the establishment of the Northeast Association, we would like to offer this thought to the gentlemen of the association and earnestly hope that the association will recognize its current heavy responsibility and move forward practically.</p>

<p>Issue of Concluding a Non-Aggression Treaty</p>
<p>Internal Disagreement in Japan</p>
<p>▲ Reuters Tokyo Dispatch The Japanese government has temporarily declined the proposal for a Russo-Japanese non-aggression treaty, but the possibility of discussing the matter in the future remains. This was explicitly stated by Foreign Minister Uchida in his address at the reopening of the Diet on January 21st. At that time, Uchida claimed that the Japanese government, in view of the differing opinions from all sides, had determined that the time for negotiating a non-aggression treaty had not yet arrived. This statement should not be regarded as a final rejection of the Soviet proposal. What he meant by "differing opinions from all sides" is indeed justified. The Japan Times once published a large amount of Ashida's pro non-aggression treaty remarks, but a few days later, the newspaper published a full-page advertisement in the form of a Ziyunzhuang manifesto, strongly criticizing the Soviet Union and its actions, and the non-aggression treaty proposal was also criticized by Ziyunzhuang. Ziyunzhuang is a legitimate organization, and most of its members are members of the Seiyukai, and the Seiyukai elected Ashida as the spokesperson to present the party's views in the Diet. From this, it can be seen that the Seiyukai has very different opinions on the conclusion of a non-aggression treaty. There is now reason to believe that the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs itself also has different views on this matter. The reason can be found in Foreign Minister Uchida's speech to the Diet. On the one hand, Uchida praised the Soviet Union's cautious attitude towards the Manchurian Incident, and on the other hand, he issued a warning, saying that if the Red Movement were to revive in the Yangtze River Basin and South China due to the restoration of relations between China and Russia, Japan must strictly guard against it in order to curb the disaster that could endanger the peace of the Far East. Uchida reiterated the opposing positions on the non-aggression treaty, with supporters arguing that closer Russo-Japanese relations would bring greater benefits to Japan, while opponents argued that communism would spread. However, both sides currently have no goodwill towards the Soviet Union, because Moscow published documents on this matter without regard to Japan's request for temporary non-publication. Moreover, the Russian ambassador to Japan sent a note to the Japanese foreign minister, containing words that the Japanese foreign minister considered insulting. Therefore, the friendly feelings towards Russia that arose from the Japanese people's sympathy and understanding of Japan's actions in North Manchuria have now diminished. Although the current animosity may eventually dissipate, Stalin's recent remarks in Moscow criticizing the Japanese are difficult to forget. Recently, small red and white paper leaflets have been found everywhere in Tokyo, printed in both Russian and Japanese, demanding a break with the Soviet Union. This also shows a glimpse of the Japanese people's animosity towards Russia. Although the establishment of the Russo-Japanese-Manchu tripartite committee is still possible. Foreign Minister Uchida recently told reporters about this plan, saying that the borders of these three countries are intertwined, and disputes can arise at any time. If this committee is established, it can handle them. The issue on this matter is currently being discussed by representatives of the Russian and Japanese consulates in Harbin. Once the new Japanese ambassador to Russia arrives in Moscow, the Russian and Japanese governments can begin formal negotiations on this matter.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Serious Situation Suddenly Arises in Romania <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Strikes and Class Boycotts Disrupt Various Locations</p>
<p>▲ Guomin News Agency, Bucharest, 3rd The occurrence of labor unrest in Romania has led to a sudden and extremely serious situation. Striking workers at the Ploiesti oil mines engaged in demonstration, clashing with troops until late at night. Authorities have dispatched a large contingent of infantry to suppress them. In several other locations, large crowds attempted to break into police stations. To date, twenty people have been seriously injured. The strikers at the Română-Americană oil company have completely destroyed it. Although authorities believe they can control the situation in Ploiesti, new disturbances have arisen in Moreni, Bucharest, and Iasi. The Moreni oil company has not paid wages for April, leading to a strike. In Bucharest, 5,000 workers in railway factories have effectively gone on strike. Their demands are quite similar to those of the Communist Party, such as the establishment of workers' committees and a 40% increase in wages. These people also attempted to entice drivers and railway guards to join, but were unsuccessful. Students at the University of Bucharest resumed their class boycott today. Professors at Iasi University also issued a letter protesting to the government. The Romanian Socialist Party has issued a declaration denouncing what it calls the dictatorial reign of terror by business leaders, who have dismissed countless workers in the cold winter without regard, while either reducing the wages or failing to pay the remaining workers, showing no consideration for the workers' well-being.</p>
<p>▲ Guomin News Agency, Bucharest, 3rd There are signs of a general strike in Ploiesti. Authorities have declared martial law today and are implementing tight security measures.</p>

<p>▲ Guomin News Agency, New York, 2nd Over two hundred Chinese seamen came to the United States as passengers, hoping to find work with various shipping companies. However, because they did not meet the hiring regulations for foreign seamen, and after protests from the International Seafarers' Federation, the Department of Labor today ordered their deportation. It is claimed that Chinese seamen could be hired on American ships according to foreign seaman quotas, but because they did not carry the necessary documents, they were deemed to be passengers seeking employment in the United States, violating regulations and leading to their expulsion.</p>

<p>Most Fierce Electoral Competition Since the War</p>
<p>Hitler Actively Eliminates Communist Forces</p>
<p>▲ Guomin News Agency, Berlin, 2nd Chancellor Hitler declared today at a meeting of National Socialist Party election campaign leaders that he will head the party's list of candidates in the upcoming election. This is also his first time being a candidate for parliament.</p>
<p>▲ Guomin News Agency, Berlin, 2nd Party headquarters are now unusually active, and party leaders are gathering to discuss preparations to cope with the fiercest electoral battle since the European War. It is said that all parties will go all out.</p>
<p>▲ Guomin News Agency, Berlin, 3rd Because competition between factions is intensifying during the election campaign, and radical elements often take excessive actions, the German government plans to restore the special courts of the Papen era to try all riot cases. Once a judgment is made, there will be no appeal.</p>

<p>▲ Havas Agency, Berlin, 2nd President Hindenburg issued an order to slightly amend the current election law. In the future, if no party member is elected in the first round of voting, any party wishing to nominate a candidate in a single constituency in the second round must have at least 60,000 signatures (60,000 votes are required for election). If this condition can be met, only fifty signatures will be required to nominate another candidate in the same constituency, or to nominate a candidate in the national constituency. Also, any Germans residing abroad who resided in Germany during the March 5th election will be able to vote. All parties must submit their lists of candidates by February 19th at the latest.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Nationwide Communist Terror <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>▲ Guomin News Agency, Berlin, 2nd Serious riots instigated by the Communist Party occurred in various cities in Germany today. In Karlsruhe, Communists and National Socialists exchanged gunfire, resulting in one death and several serious injuries. In Königsberg, police clashed with Communist demonstrators, injuring eight people. Riots also occurred in several cities in the Cologne and Ruhr regions. The free states of Mecklenburg and Oldenburg are both controlled by the National Socialist Party, and are now imitating the state of Prussia by prohibiting Communist demonstrations.</p>
<p>▲ Guomin News Agency, Berlin, 2nd Police searched the Berlin Communist Party headquarters this morning, and had not finished by noon. A police officer who was ambushed and killed on Sunday night, along with a leader of the National Socialist Party's stormtroopers, will be given a public funeral on Sunday. The government will send representatives to attend the funeral service at the church, and police and stormtroopers will escort the carriages.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Berlin, 2nd Hitler is still engaged in suppressing the political enemies of the new government. In addition to ordering many Communist newspapers to stop publishing, he has also completely prohibited the Communist Party from holding demonstrations in the states of Prussia, Brunswick, Mecklenburg, and Thuringia, where the National Socialist Party wields great power. The Republican Party's plan to hold a large demonstration in front of the palace on Sunday was also prevented by the police, because one police officer and one member of the National Socialist Party who died in the recent riots will be given a public funeral that day, and there may be clashes between the two sides. The two corpses are now on display in a Berlin church, which is a special form of ceremony. Hitler is now urging his party members to strictly observe discipline, and expects that the Communist Party's acts of terror will soon collapse.</p>
<h3 id="e78">Reactions After the Dissolution of Parliament <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>▲ Guomin News Agency, Berlin, 2nd The dissolution of the German parliament has evoked different feelings and interests in various countries due to their different relations with Germany. France clearly harbors a feeling of regret towards the dissolution of the German parliament. Britain's attitude is more peaceful, while Italy feels that this move is an inevitable fact, which can at least make the German political situation slightly clearer. Within Germany, it is felt that although the preparation time for the next election is extremely short, all parties will still do their best to compete. However, the National Socialist Party has become powerful, and its convenient position will inevitably enable it to control the greatest victory. Furthermore, the electoral regulations for the next election will be slightly changed, that is, in the future, diplomatic consuls and their family members, as well as maritime and inland navigation personnel, will be able to join the election.</p>
<p>▲ Guomin News Agency, Berlin, 3rd Today, the German Social Democratic Party, the Democratic Party, and the Communist Party requested the Standing Committee of the Parliament to immediately convene the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Parliamentary Rights Protection Committee so that they could discuss separately the government's attitude towards the Sino-Japanese dispute in the Far East and the measures taken by the government and the police in recent days, because the two parties believe that these measures seriously interfere with electoral freedom. Also, the Center Party and the Bavarian People's Party sent a letter to the president protesting the dissolution of parliament, saying that the claim that a majority could not be formed in parliament was untrue because the authorities deliberately abandoned the two parties, and it was not impossible to form a majority. Also, Bavarian Prime Minister Held started the election campaign today, speaking at a mass meeting, also fiercely attacking the methods of Hitler's cabinet, saying that domestic affairs should be handled with clarity and honesty and not with conspiracy, and when discussing Bavaria's autonomous rights, he demanded that Bavaria should have the right to decide its future government.</p>
<p>▲ Guomin News Agency, Berlin, 2nd Critics of Hitler's broadcast speech on Wednesday night pointed out that it lacked a positive plan. Political circles have stated that this declaration is not a policy statement of the new government, and the policy statement of the new government will be announced after several special tasks are completed.</p>
<p>▲ Guomin News Agency, Vienna, 2nd The National Socialist students of the University of Vienna held a grand meeting today to celebrate the inauguration of German Chancellor Hitler. Among those who participated were the dean of the University of Vienna, Professor Abol, and others. The chairman of the National Socialist Student Union gave a passionate speech, saying that Hitler was born in Austria and is now the Chancellor of Germany. Therefore, the Austrian people are leading the German nation and people out of danger and into the road of prosperity. For this reason, Austria must seek to unite with the "German motherland".</p>

<p>Internally, Save the Financial Crisis</p>
<p>Externally, Maintain International Peace</p>
<p>▲ Havas Agency, Paris, 3rd The Daladier cabinet read a declaration in both houses of parliament this afternoon, saying that the government will strive to resolve the economic and financial crisis, and overcome difficulties materially and spiritually. The cabinet declaration acknowledges that people's hearts are uneasy, wanting major reforms but not knowing how, or thinking that taking risks and seeking luck can remedy the difficult times. In fact, only by faithfully implementing the parliamentary system can everything be rectified. The Republican government, under the supervision of the people's representatives, should exercise its power with strong and agile actions. The government's financial plan also takes into account the taxpayers' ability to pay, and will make major cuts. As for tax evasion, the government will propose legislation to punish it. The government's financial plan will be submitted to the House of Representatives on Tuesday, and it is hoped that the democratic parties will support it. As for international issues, the cabinet declaration said that the most urgent matter is the security of France and other countries. It also said that if all nations enjoy equal rights, they should bear equal obligations. Without security, there is no credibility, no economic recovery, no disarmament plan, and no arbitration. We will seek a way out in economic conferences and disarmament conferences, in order to reduce the losses of all countries, seek true peace, and reduce the waste of armaments. We are willing to maintain the closest relationship with friendly countries and all well-meaning powers, and respect each other's national systems. The cabinet declaration ends and begins in the same way, expressing its belief in Republican politics.</p>

<p>Czech Representative Beneš Successfully Mediates</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Geneva The dispute between Britain and Persia regarding the cancellation of oil concessions has reached a provisional agreement. This morning, the League of Nations Council met here and approved the agreement, which is divided into four points as follows: 1) Both parties agree to suspend their proceedings in the Council until May or a period slightly later than May. 2) Both parties agree that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company must begin negotiations immediately, and all legal points of both parties are fully reserved. 3) If the negotiations for a new concession fail, the issue may be resubmitted to the Council. 4) Before a final resolution, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company's business in Persia will continue and revert to its state before November 27. British representative Eden praised the efforts of Czech representative Beneš in mediating after the Persian representative expressed his agreement, and said that if a solution could be negotiated on an equal basis, Britain would very much like the oil company and Persia to have such a solution. The true interests of the Persian government and the oil company are the same, and he is confident that a mutually beneficial agreement can be reached.</p>

<p>▲ Reuters, Paris, 2nd A Royalist newspaper here published an article advocating restoration, with the Duke of Guise ascending the throne and implementing dictatorial politics. The article was signed by the Duke himself. After the death of the Duke of Orléans, the Duke of Guise regarded himself as the heir to the throne. He now lives in Brussels.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Britain States Its Position on the War Debt Issue <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Based on the Principle of Not Exceeding the Lausanne Agreement</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 2nd It is believed here that Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain's speech at a reception for American journalists on the 1st has created the impression that the British government hopes that negotiations between Britain and the United States will be limited to war debts. Responsible parties in London issued statements clarifying that the solution to the war debt issue is based on the principle of not exceeding the agreements of the Lausanne Conference and not infringing on the rights of other countries. As for issues related to war debts, there are no restrictions on discussion.</p>
<p>▲ Havas Agency, London, 2nd Chancellor Chamberlain's declaration to the American press completely rejects various conditions proposed by the United States for a satisfactory solution to the war debt issue. It is generally believed that the Chancellor's rebuttal of the American conditions one by one is intended to maintain the principles that Britain has always adhered to, that is, the cancellation of war debts is the best solution, and its impact is the same as the cancellation of reparations to Germany. The cancellation of war debts will relieve the world economy of its burden, and the good results it will produce will be more than enough to compensate the United States. From this, it can be seen that Britain is still adhering to the policies it has followed for the past ten years and the principle that European debtor countries should unite, as declared in Britain's previous notes before December 15 of last year. Britain has always advocated that the war debt issue be resolved in the manner of the Lausanne Conference, that is, to cancel it fundamentally and unconditionally. This time, the Chancellor's declaration rebutting the American conditions, even disapproving of the method of deferral, makes the idea of Britain's unconditional cancellation of war debts even more credible.</p>
<p>▲ Guomin News Agency, Washington, 2nd Today, US Senator Robinson proposed in the Senate that Berridge's negotiation of war debts abroad violates federal law, and demanded that the Senate order the State Department to recall him. Therefore, Roosevelt's friends immediately telegraphed Ross, and received a reply stating that he had not authorized Berridge to engage in any negotiations. Robinson's move was directed at Roosevelt, because the radicals of the Republican Party mostly oppose Ross's presiding over informal negotiations at this time.</p>

<p>▲ Guomin News Agency, Warm Springs, 2nd President-elect Roosevelt is now planning to develop the Muscle Shoals in the Tennessee River, establish a large hydroelectric plant, and absorb nitrogen from the air to manufacture nitrates. This plan was originally initiated by President Wilson, who wanted to manufacture nitrates for the Allied forces to use in combat. When the Democratic government left office in 1921, the Republican Party passed a bill to stop state-owned operations and lease the completed hydroelectric plant to private individuals. Now Ross is seeking to continue Wilson's legacy and expand it. It is estimated that 71,000 people can be employed in the first year, and up to 200,000 people can be employed thereafter, which is also a strategy to solve the unemployment problem.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Warm Springs, 2nd President-elect Roosevelt announced to a reporter today his domestic tax plan, which, if implemented, could provide work for tens of thousands of unemployed people in the United States. This plan includes afforestation, water conservancy, and agricultural improvement. It is expected that the distribution of population between urban and rural areas can be equalized as a result. Roosevelt predicted that the experiment of this plan could accommodate 200,000 unemployed people in the Tennessee Valley alone. Roosevelt hopes to implement this plan elsewhere in the country, from the Allegheny Mountains to the Pacific Coast, so that he can relieve unemployment and eliminate the ills of industrial concentration.</p>

<h3 id="e85">Investigation of Soviet Military Preparations (Moscow Correspondence) <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Although the Soviet Union is today a nation that steadfastly adheres to a policy of peace, its military preparations emphasize defense over offense. Furthermore, due to its ongoing efforts in social construction, its military arrangements are not as advanced as those of other countries. However, because of the differences in its ideology and policies, the capitalist nations of the world are watching it intently, ready to pounce at any weakness. The recent ominous situation in the Far East has been a major threat to the Soviet Union. Therefore, while social construction is being vigorously accelerated, preparations in the military sphere are also increasing daily. During the first Five-Year Plan, the military aspect was specifically shortened to be completed in three years (the army and navy budget was 760 million rubles in 1927 and increased to 1.28 billion rubles in 1932). This shows the extent to which it is intensifying its defenses. In the world struggles of the near future, the Soviet Union will undoubtedly occupy an extremely important position, especially on the Far Eastern stage, where it will be a key player. Therefore, the current state of its military preparations should be something that the people of our nation are eager to know. A brief report is presented below.</p>
<p>(Outline of the Military System) The Soviet military system is based on conscription, stipulating a service period from age nineteen to forty, totaling twenty-two years. Before conscription, there are two years of preparatory education, followed by five years of active service and fifteen years in the reserves. According to the Soviet Constitution, non-laborers are not allowed to serve in the military, as military service is considered an honor and a right. Therefore, Soviet youths, upon reaching adulthood, all serve in the military. The Soviet army can be divided into two types: the regular army and the reserve army. The reserve army is required to undergo eight to eleven months of military education over five years. This system is intended to disseminate military education to the general male population in the most economical way, and it is enforced by the government. This shows that military education in the Soviet Union is exceptionally widespread. In the event of war, the number of soldiers able to participate in combat would be enormous.</p>
<p>(Overview of Military Strength) The Soviet Union's peacetime military strength is approximately 1.3 million people, including over seventy infantry divisions, a dozen cavalry divisions, about ten independent brigades, and other units such as aviation and chemical warfare units. Among these land forces, eight divisions are stationed in the Leningrad Military District, twelve divisions in the Moscow Military District, twenty-one divisions in the Ukrainian Military District, six divisions in the Volga Military District, eight divisions in the North Caucasus Military District, twelve divisions in the Belorussian Military District, three divisions in the Siberian Military District, seven divisions in the Far East, four divisions and two brigades in Central Asia, and seven divisions and one brigade in the Independent Caucasus area. Their combat capabilities are described in the following sections: ① Infantry: Each division is divided into three regiments, each regiment containing one signals platoon, one reconnaissance platoon, three assault battalions, nine companies (nine light machine gun platoons), three heavy machine gun companies, three battalion artillery platoons, one regimental artillery battalion (two companies), two chemical platoons, three assault platoons, and two machine gun platoons. Each division is equipped with a total of 162 light machine guns, 108 heavy machine guns, and 36 field guns, as well as hand grenades. ② Cavalry: Soviet cavalry has always been considered among the best in the world. In the 1920 Russo-Polish War, Russia prevailed due to its superior cavalry. However, in modern tactics, cavalry is generally considered less useful. Therefore, while the Soviet Union has excellent cavalry, whether it will occupy a significant position on the battlefield in the future remains a question. Nevertheless, in warfare on vast plains, cavalry is still extremely necessary for communication and transportation. ③ Armored Vehicle Units: Armored vehicles were first used by the British army on the Somme battlefield in September 1916. After the British army launched a major offensive with hundreds of armored vehicles against the German army on the Cambrai battlefield in 1917, all countries spared no expense in manufacturing them. The Soviet Union has also been rapidly improving and increasing its armored vehicle units in recent years. ④ Aviation: The Soviet air force was quite weak ten years ago. In 1922, it had only twenty squadrons, which increased to seventy-eight squadrons in 1925 and one hundred and four squadrons in 1928. Currently, it has reached over two hundred squadrons, including 194 land aircraft squadrons and 20 seaplane squadrons, totaling 2,200 aircraft. The Soviet Union plans to add another two hundred squadrons within ten years. Regarding the aviation manufacturing industry, there are now twenty-five factories nationwide, producing heavy bombers with a total weight of twenty tons, which are comparable to those produced by Germany and Italy. At the same time, the entire Soviet population is particularly enthusiastic about the development of aviation. There is a National Defense Aviation and Chemical Association, which is a semi-official organization with over 17 million members. The mission of this association is to conduct military training for the people under the guidance of the government. It has established military chemical research institutes, clubs, shooting clubs, and equestrian clubs in various locations, with particular emphasis on the study of aviation and poison gas. In addition, it has established numerous aviation schools to train general aviation technicians. Because the Soviet Union has vast lands, few railways, and inconvenient transportation, it is urgently seeking the development of aviation. In peacetime, it can be used for transportation, and in wartime, it can facilitate military operations. Last year, the Soviet Union invested a total of 150 million rubles in aviation construction. The aviation lines reached 49,000 kilometers last year. All of this is the result of the efforts of the Soviet people and their government. ⑤ Military Chemistry: Modern warfare will evolve into chemical warfare. All countries are striving to refine their research in military chemistry. The Soviet Union also has unusually strict military facilities in this regard. It strives to popularize national military chemical education and currently has three chemical warfare schools, six chemical weapons research institutes, and four chemical weapons manufacturing plants.</p>
<p>(Soldier Capabilities) Soviet soldiers have the special characteristic of being particularly hardy. Therefore, if they can be given good equipment, complete military education, and led by outstanding commanders, they can become the strongest army in the world. This is recognized by people around the world. In the old imperial era, due to the lack of universal education, the majority of soldiers were illiterate. They frequently missed many opportunities in battle due to a lack of knowledge. Since the revolution, due to the government's efforts to promote universal education, illiteracy has decreased daily. Soldiers have received considerable education before enlisting and continue to receive training after enlisting. The results of soldier training are excellent. Special attention is paid to spiritual education, that is, political education. The purpose is to make every person a communist cell. Therefore, Soviet soldiers can be considered excellent soldiers in modern times. Unfortunately, the strategic abilities of middle and lower-ranking military officers are mostly very immature. This is the biggest shortcoming of the Soviet army.</p>
<p>(Treatment of Soldiers) The Soviet government's treatment of soldiers is very comprehensive. It pays special attention not only to active duty soldiers but also to veterans, providing benefits such as retirement and death benefits, subsidies for childbirth, assistance with family medical expenses, free transportation, preferential treatment for children's education, and so on. There are also noteworthy aspects of the treatment of active duty soldiers, such as ① preserving the farms assigned to enlisted active duty soldiers on their behalf, ② allowing them to receive labor funds or unemployment benefits during refresher training, ③ reserving positions to be filled by veterans in order to avoid unemployment after their service is completed, ④ providing considerable tax exemptions for postal taxes and transportation costs, and ⑤ offering extremely favorable housing allocation. These types of benefits for soldiers would be unusually difficult to implement in other countries, but they are extremely easy to implement in the Soviet Union because its social system is inherently like this. Even for people who are not soldiers, life is already very comfortable.</p>
<p>(Relationship with the Far East) Here, we must add that since the Eastern Province Incident, the Soviet Union has increased its troops in the Far East. According to Japanese sources, the Soviet military strength in the Far East has reached more than 100,000. However, as Japanese forces have shown a tendency to advance rapidly northwestward from the mainland, the Soviet Union cannot but take appropriate precautions for its own security. The Soviet authorities have repeatedly stated that the Soviet Union has no intention of challenging any country, but if other countries intend to invade the Soviet Union, then the Soviet Union will defend itself. Therefore, we cannot say that the Soviet Union's troop increase in the Far East means that it is preparing for a conflict with Japan, nor can we say that the Soviet Union has reached a considerable compromise with Japan simply because it has not made any active statement. We believe that the Soviet Union has its own definite position, which cannot be expressed until the appropriate time. (January 5)</p>
<h3 id="e86">Planned Actions of the Japanese Army in Hankou <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Strict Security in the Japanese Concession, All Residents Armed</p>
<p>Officials and Merchants Hold Important Meetings Repeatedly, Situation Becomes Increasingly Tense</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Since the start of the fighting in Jehol, the Japanese army and navy stationed in Hankou have been actively preparing for military action. In recent days, they have been installing artillery positions, moving warships, and forcing all residents to arm themselves. The tension is palpable, and a conflict seems imminent. It has been observed that whenever there is a conflict between China and Japan, the Japanese always prepare for war in Hankou to disrupt our rear. What they are doing now is indeed a planned action, not merely a demonstration of force. I will now report on the recent situation in detail.</p>
<p>(Land and Sea Security in the Japanese Concession) The Japanese concession in Hankou is located in the far east of the city, bordering the Special District No. 1. It reaches the Yangtze River in the south and the Pinghan Railway in the north. It is a place that harbors dirt and filth. It is as if there is a separate world within Hankou City. Recently, due to military arrangements, the scene is extremely grim. Artillery positions have been set up on the roads bordering the Chinese and Japanese areas, with the largest being up to 20 centimeters in caliber. Preparations are also being made to erect electric fences. Police are now on double duty, and telephones have been installed at all guard posts. Key locations, such as the consulate, the naval landing force headquarters, the administrative committee of the residents' association, the police station, and the police department, all have air defense facilities. Traffic along the naval docks on the Japanese border is cut off at 9 p.m. The river surface is originally stationed with the Ataka, Uji, Tsushima, Hira, and Kotaka warships. They are all connected. It is impossible to ascertain how many naval personnel are stationed there. It can only be seen that they are conducting landing exercises every day and maneuvering artillery after returning to the ships. The Kotaka warship was ordered to go to Changsha one day, and the Ataka and other four warships remained in Hankou. Commander Sakano of the 1st Overseas Dispatch Fleet is stationed here in charge.</p>
<p>(Residents Armed, Okamura's Bold Words) Naval Commander Sakano summoned naval officers and soldiers from various warships at the non-commissioned officer assembly hall one day and gave a speech. The content is unknown. At the same time, Army Attaché Okamura declared to the Japanese residents that the country's Third Overseas Dispatch Fleet had a strong presence in the Yangtze River. The ammunition currently on each warship is sufficient for eight hours of continuous firing every day, enough for ten days. He also ordered all residents to arm themselves and receive military training. The first batch has been trained and matured, and the second and third batches are being trained intensively. All of them will be issued firearms for use. There are currently over 1,900 Japanese residents, excluding prostitutes and children. Among them, there are no fewer than 1,000 strong men. If they are organized, it would be equivalent to a regiment of conscripts. There are also 147 veterans and 40 members of the youth league who can be conscripted as soldiers in case of emergency. In peacetime, they use retirement or being in the countryside to cover up the eyes and ears of foreigners. It is equivalent to having two companies of reservists.</p>
<p>(Officials and Merchants Meeting to Plot Against Us) Important personnel from the Japanese army and navy held a meeting a few days ago to discuss the military arrangements for the Yangtze River. It has now concluded. The consulate held another secret meeting yesterday, attended by many important merchants. Military personnel also participated. The important resolutions are not easy to ascertain. What is known is that ① they secretly contacted rice merchants in the Chinese area to purchase large quantities of rice for hoarding in preparation for emergencies; ② the traffic office in the Japanese area is heavily guarded and will erect electric fences if necessary; ③ they are buying over Chinese traitors to inspect our fortifications and the locations where our troops are stationed or transferred; ④ all Japanese residents in Hankou will be issued firearms; and ⑤ the consul will convene a secret meeting once a week. In addition, Kiyokawa, the head of the administrative committee of the Japanese residents' association, convened a business conference of Japanese merchants, attended by more than 40 people. It was decided that all merchants doing business in the Chinese area must report the type, value, quantity, and business conditions of their goods in detail every day for reference.</p>
<p>(Extensive Establishment of Agencies to Probe Our Military Situation) The Japanese are extremely attentive to our military situation. In recent days, they have dispatched ruffians, disguised as Chinese or using Chinese traitors, to Wuchang, Hanyang, Guishan, the arsenal, and the towns downstream of Tianjia Town to conduct reconnaissance. Their movements are secretive. Recently, they have established two intelligence agencies: one is the Naval Landing Force Intelligence Department, commanded by naval officer Tajiri, and the other is the Japanese Police Department's Higher Section and the United Electric News Agency, commanded by the Japanese Consulate. They subscribe to as many as twenty-two major and minor newspapers in Wuhan and Shanghai and compile all anti-Japanese articles. They have detailed investigations into the names, brief histories, and sources of income of the responsible persons and editors of each newspaper, as well as the number of copies sold. They have also drawn up charts of the locations of military installations and the Special District No. 1 and the territories under the jurisdiction of the 13 districts that are adjacent to the Japanese concession. Yesterday, Japanese naval and army officers inspected the Japanese concession for a week and looked at the watchtowers near Liujiamiao. Their probing of our military situation can be described as meticulous.</p>
<p>(Hiding Traitors, Colluding with Bad Elements) The Japanese concession has always been tolerant of our country's rebels, not only political prisoners. Recently, it was discovered that Zheng Jianghao, the secretary of the Transportation Department of the puppet Manchurian state, was hiding in the Japanese concession. Zheng is originally from Hubei. After the establishment of the puppet organization, he took on this position and came to Hankou under the orders of the puppet regime. He has been protected by the Japanese and lives at No. 19 Dawamai Street, the residence of Liu Qiangsheng, in the Japanese concession. He is now eager to flee back to the Northeast and has decided to wait for Commander Sakano of Japan to go to Shanghai and accompany him. In addition, there are ruffians colluding with Chinese bad elements such as Lin Runbo to smuggle firearms and ammunition to bandits and local bandits. The ruffians are responsible for transporting them. They also forge various banknotes of 10 yuan, 5 yuan, and 1 yuan from the Henan Farmers and Workers Bank and the Hankou Central and Southern Bank, as well as subsidiary coins of 5 jiao, 2 jiao, and 1 jiao from the provincial bank, which are carried by Lin and others to various places for use. One purpose is to disrupt our country's finances, and the other is to purchase large quantities of grain. (February 2)</p>
<h3 id="e87">The Southwest Has Decided on a Major Plan to Resist Japan <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Bai Chongxi Also Attends the Meeting in Guangzhou</p>
<p>Cai Tingkai Advocates Unity and Solidarity Against External Aggression</p>
<p>Huang Shaohong Takes the Results Back to Nanjing to Report</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Since Li Zongren, Huang Shaohong, and Cai Tingkai successively arrived in Guangzhou, Bai Chongxi from Nanning also came to Guangzhou from Nanning on January 23, accompanied by Ye Qi, the Chief of Staff of the Fourth Army Group. On the 25th, he arrived in Wuzhou and transferred to a steamer eastward in the afternoon. On the 26th, he arrived at Sanshui Hekou at 1:00 p.m. Upon receiving the news, the political circles here immediately sent a Guangzhou-Sanshui floral car to welcome him. Military and political figures and personnel from the rear office of the Fourth Army Group also went to Shiwetang Station to welcome him. Bai's special train arrived at 4:20 p.m. Bai then took a car to Li Zongren's residence in Mapenggang, East Mountain, to visit Li. After talking for a while, he went to visit Huang Shaohong and Chen Jitang. After finishing, he returned to Li's residence in Mapenggang to stay. The Southwest Political Affairs Committee hosted a banquet at 12:00 noon on the 27th, inviting Chen Jitang, Li Zongren, Deng Zeru, Zou Lu, Lin Yunhai, Liu Luyin, Xiang Hanping, Miao Peinan, Ye Qi, Wang Zanbin, Liu Jiwen, and dozens of others because Cai Tingkai, Huang Shaohong, and Bai Chongxi had successively arrived. The atmosphere was very pleasant during the banquet, and it lasted until 1:00 p.m. In the evening of the 27th, Chen Jitang hosted another banquet for Cai, Huang, Bai, and others at his private residence in the Model Village. It is said that Bai's important purpose in coming here is to consolidate the Southwest's defenses and discuss important issues related to resisting Japan.</p>
<p>As for Cai Tingkai's consultations in Guangdong on the major plan to resist Japan, it has recently been heard that results have been achieved. According to Cai, it is inconvenient to disclose details about national defense and military affairs to the outside world. However, resisting Japan and suppressing the Communists must have a comprehensive plan and unified solidarity. No single aspect can be carried out independently. Secondly, consolidating national defense should be planned at all times and not only when disaster strikes. Our country has always been negligent about national defense. Therefore, we suffered a lot in the Songhu Anti-Japanese War last year. It is urgent for the provinces in the Southwest to prepare for national defense. For example, Guangdong has a very long coastline, and we can be attacked anytime and anywhere. Therefore, the military arrangements for coastal defense fortresses are particularly urgent. Recent war trophies, such as fighter planes and new-style guns and artillery, should be urgently stored. However, some people in the country do not know how to plan national defense and use the few national defense weapons they have for internal conflicts. This is truly heartbreaking. I hope that the people of the country will prioritize the country in the future and make consolidating the country's territory the prerequisite, and stop starting civil wars due to private views. My telegrams a few days ago called for the cessation of internal conflicts, which were triggered by the Sichuan-Guizhou civil war. I urge all rulers to abandon private struggles and prepare to sacrifice for the preservation of national territory. As for the issue of suppressing the Communists, it is as important as resisting Japan. Being destroyed by the Communists is the same as being destroyed by Japan. Our army has been making steady progress in suppressing the Communists in Fujian. There are now no large Communist bandits hiding in the entire Fujian area. There are occasional sporadic local Communists appearing, but they are not a cause for concern. Changting was originally accessible and could have been entered by a direct drive, but it was not possible due to insufficient preparations for supplies. The Communist Party was originally one of the political parties. Foreign Communist parties engage in political struggles in peacetime, but once there is a foreign invasion, political struggles immediately cease, and they unite to resist foreign aggression. If our country's Communist Party can realize this in the future, prioritize the country, and act as a vanguard against external aggression, then the central government may give them a chance to reform.</p>
<p>As for Huang Shaohong's biggest task in coming south, it is to unite the Southwest to be consistent with the central government in resisting external aggression. Because the central government already has a comprehensive plan to resist external aggression, it must obtain the understanding of the leaders of the Southwest and stop publishing divergent opinions. Then the plan will be easier to implement. Cai Tingkai's coming to Guangdong also shares the same view as Huang. It is said that after repeated meetings, the Southwest has unanimously accepted the central government's comprehensive plan to resist external aggression. At the same time, the three provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian must also be prepared. It is slightly heard that on the active side, each of the three provinces plans to select a certain number of strong men to form volunteer armies, ready to be mobilized at any time. As for handling this matter, a Guangdong-Guangxi-Fujian Provincial Volunteer Army Military Commission will be established to be responsible. The members of the commission will be senior military officers appointed by the three provinces. The volunteer armies of the three provinces are currently preparing to be trained. Once Huang Shaohong returns to Nanjing to report and waits for the central government's order, they can be mobilized. On the passive side, that is, to carry out coastal fortress arrangements for national defense in the southwestern provinces, and to pay close attention to transportation. The leaders and generals of the three provinces also held a meeting to discuss this in detail. Decisions were made on issues such as how many troops should be stationed in the fortresses in the southwestern provinces in the future, how many more artillery positions should be added, and whether senior officials should be assigned to the fortresses. The above active and passive plans have all been drafted in special projects, and they are all handed over to Huang Shaohong to take back to Nanjing to be reviewed by the central government. After the central government approves and replies, they will be implemented accordingly. Huang completed his mission and left Guangdong on the morning of the 30th. Bai Chongxi went to Hong Kong with him. After meeting with a certain tycoon in Hong Kong, Huang took a steamer to Shanghai and returned to Nanjing, and Bai also took a steamer from Hong Kong back to Guangxi. Cai Tingkai still needs to stay for a few more days and will return to Fujian after meeting with Yu Hanmou, the commander of the First Army. (January 30 evening)</p>
<h3 id="e88">He Chengjun and Shao Lizhi Arrive in Wuhan Together <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Immediately Proceeding from Wuhan to Jiangxi to Meet Chairman Chiang Kai-shek</p>
<p>A dispatch from Hankou reports that He Chengjun, the Pacification Commissioner for Hubei, and Shao Lizhi, Chairman of the Gansu Provincial Government, needing to report on military and political affairs to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, agreed to travel from Xi'an to Nanjing together.  Learning that Chairman Chiang had departed for Nanchang, they changed their route, taking the Longhai Railway to the Pinghan Railway, going south to Wuhan and then on to Nanchang.  Mr. Shao, together with Cai Jingchen, Secretary-General of the Gansu Provincial Government, arrived in Xi'an by Eurasian Aviation plane from Lanzhou at 5:00 PM on January 28th.  He met with He Chengjun and Yang Hucheng.  At 9:00 AM on January 31st, He and Shao departed in four cars for Tongguan, where they transferred to a special train on the Longhai Railway, heading east.  They arrived in Zhengzhou at 8:00 AM on the 1st of this month.  At 8:00 PM that afternoon, they switched to a special train on the Pinghan Railway heading south.  They arrived in Wuhan around 5:00 PM on the 2nd.  They are scheduled to take a steamer to Xun on the evening of the 3rd, transferring to Nanchang to meet Chairman Chiang.  According to the statements issued by He and Shao, they are as follows:</p>
<p>(He Chengjun's Statement)  He stated briefly, "I received orders from Commander-in-Chief Chiang to depart from Wuhan for Xi'an on December 26th of last year to establish an administrative office to command various units to pursue and suppress the bandit troops of Xu Xiangqian.  After arriving in Xi'an, I immediately discussed and determined a pursuit and suppression plan with Director Yang Hucheng, instructing the various units responsible for bandit suppression to diligently pursue and suppress the bandits in various directions according to the established steps.  I also telegraphed Sichuanese military generals, Liu Cunhou, the Border Defense Commissioner of Sichuan and Shaanxi, and Tian Songyao, the commander of the 29th Army, to send troops to block them.  Xu's bandits suffered heavy losses in Shaanxi, realizing that the National Army was powerful and could not be resisted. They resorted to their old tricks, avoiding strength and attacking weakness.  After passing through southern Shaanxi, they did not engage the National Army, but devoted themselves to fleeing, and finally fled to the mountains near Tongjiang in northern Sichuan.  Shaanxi troops have now reached suitable locations and made proper deployments.  The Sichuanese troops of Tian Songyao have also been fully mobilized, totaling four divisions and three brigades. Director Yang Hucheng and Army Commander Tian Songyao are respectively responsible for command. Tian himself is personally supervising the suppression in Nanyuan and has already departed.  The Gansu side has also dispatched considerable forces to garrison key passes to prevent their escape. The remaining strength of the remnant bandits is no more than 6,000 firearms. They lack ammunition and supplies. With our large army suppressing them, they will be unable to withstand a single blow.  However, recently the weather has been cold, the ground frozen, and ice and snow cover the roads. The steep mountains are naturally sealed off, making troop movement particularly inconvenient.  Once the weather warms up slightly, we will advance and severely suppress them.  The bandits are surrounded on all sides and have nowhere to escape, but are merely prolonging their lives for a few days.  As for within Shaanxi Province, the remnant bandits have been completely cleared, and the area is extremely peaceful. Because Sichuan and Shaanxi both have commanders, I accompanied Chairman Shao back to Wuhan and then to Jiangxi to meet Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, report on the progress of the pursuit and suppression, and request instructions on all matters. The question of whether to retain the Xi'an administrative office and whether I should return to Shaanxi will be decided after meeting with Chairman Chiang."</p>
<p>(Shao Lizhi's Statement)  He stated briefly, "Because I have been separated from Chairman Chiang for a long time and am eager to meet him, I have specially requested a four-week leave from the Central Government to go to Jiangxi.  The administrative affairs of Gansu Province have been temporarily entrusted to Director Deng Baoshan of the Gansu office of the Shaanxi Pacification Superintendent.  My mission to Jiangxi, in addition to reporting to Chairman Chiang on the political situation in Gansu Province, is also to request to resign from my position as Provincial Chairman.  After a short stay in Jiangxi, I will go to Nanjing to report to the Executive Yuan.  As for the situation in Gansu Province, because it is located in the western frontier, there have been too many troops and too little production in the past. Coupled with natural and man-made disasters, the people are extremely impoverished, and the financial situation is very strained. Before I took office, government expenses were more than ten months in arrears, education expenses were more than twenty months in arrears, and debts owed to shops in Lanzhou amounted to more than 4.6 million, totaling over 8 to 9 million yuan including other debts. Despite my repeated efforts to reorganize, I am still short of 500,000 yuan.  Moreover, the salaries of civil servants are no more than 80 yuan at the highest and 30 yuan at the lowest, making it difficult to maintain a living.  The original Northwest and Peasant Banks in Lanzhou have now both gone bankrupt, financial activity is extremely sluggish, and commerce is also very depressed, so provincial administration has reached a dead end.  With Gansu Province being barren and the people poor, such long-term deficits will be unsustainable in the future. Fortunately, the area is stable, and harmony between Han and Hui people alleviates the Central Government's concerns about the west.  Ma Hongkui's troops have now returned to Ningxia, and Ma himself has arrived in Dingkou. He met with Director Yang in Shaanxi and they had a very pleasant conversation. Yang is busy and cannot go to Jiangxi for the time being.  As for the recent invasion of Yuguan by Japanese soldiers, all Chinese people are indignant.  The division and brigade commanders of Gansu Province have repeatedly telegraphed the Central Government requesting permission to send troops to resist the invaders.  Public organizations and schools are particularly agitated." (February 2nd)</p>

<p>(Additional Property Tax Surcharge for Purchasing Air Defense Weapons)</p>
<p>A dispatch from Wuhu states that the Wuhu Administrative Inspector's Office yesterday invited leaders from all walks of life to discuss consolidating local security.  It was decided to add a surcharge to property taxes, amounting to approximately 70,000 to 80,000 yuan, to be jointly borne by landlords and tenants, to purchase several anti-aircraft guns and Krupp cannons as local self-defense weapons.  It is also planned to raise additional funds to purchase one fighter plane.  Furthermore, due to the lurking presence of bandits and communists in the southern Anhui area, in order to prevent hidden dangers from arising, it was specially decided to organize a People's Self-Defense Committee.  A meeting was also held at the Administrative Inspector's Office the day before yesterday, and Zhou Mengwen, You Zhentao, Yu Tang, Cui Lianggong, Yu Ceqin, Yang Ke..., Zeng Mingliang, Shen Zitao, Xu Xinpu and other nine people were elected as members. It was announced on January 30th.  The Workers' Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, organized by workers, resolved at today's meeting that, according to a letter from the Shanghai General Labor Union, as the violent Japanese have recently actively attacked Rehe again, all anti-Japanese groups in Shanghai are now striving to recover.  The association should also convene a representative conference of all labor unions on a regular basis to jointly intensify the anti-Japanese work, and request the Shanghai General Labor Union to send the organizational regulations of the anti-Japanese groups for reference.  Qiu Zhanyun was then dispatched to the province to ask the provincial party headquarters for instructions on all policies. (February 1st)</p>

<p>An old woman named Liu, residing at No. 6, Dashiqiao in the city, has been selling crude red and black pills as her business. Every day, she can sell more than a dozen tins, and her doorstep is crowded. Gentlemen are frightened by it. Yesterday, Wang reported her to the Narcotics Investigation Office. The Director of Investigation, Chen Xisun, ordered many investigators to rush to search the place. On the spot, they found twelve empty tins of "Dragon Brand" red pills, five paper bags of "Tiger Brand," and hundreds of red pills. They took the witness to the station to await transfer to the province for interrogation.</p>

<p>In Wutangmen, Southern Spring, the 14th District, more than ten li from Taihu Lake, on Mount Tu, there is a villager named Ye, who makes a living by boat. The other day, he loaded goods from another village, unloaded them, and was sailing home. When he sailed near Mount Tu, he suddenly saw a black object floating on the lake, sometimes sinking and sometimes floating, resembling a corpse. Ye was curious, so he ordered his crew to pull it up. Unexpectedly, it was a huge strange bird that had frozen to death. Its entire body of feathers had turned grayish-white, and it weighed more than thirty catties. Its head was as big as a bamboo sieve, its eyes were like copper bells, and its toes had membranes, similar to a northern ostrich. At that time, Ye brought it back to Mount Tu, and the whole city was shocked. Crowds gathered to watch. Now, it is planned to take the bird to Shanghai for research.</p>

At that time, Xieyuan, Liyuan, and other factories first donated 790 yuan. It was also decided that employees in each factory with a monthly salary of more than eight yuan would donate 5% of their salary for six months, which is expected to raise more than 10,000 yuan. It will be advanced by those responsible for each factory and handed over to the collection agency.

<p>The Jiangsu Maritime...? on the night of the 29th of last month, looted in Lvsi... from 8:00 PM until 2:00 AM on the 30th. Only four families in the city were spared. County Magistrate Zhang has gone to Lvsi to handle the aftermath. When the provincial guerrilla team mutinied, they first fired two signal shots. The second and third squadrons launched an attack together. The first squadron did not follow and went to the open space west of the street with the defense regiment. After the second and third squadrons went out to sea from Sanjia Town, the first squadron also feared punishment and went to sea from Pengjiatao. The officers who did not mutiny in the team, including Battalion Adjutant Min Shousong, Adjutant Ma Yingwu, and Squadron Leader Yue Haining, are negotiating to go to sea and recruit the mutineers.</p>

<p>Zhenjiang's commerce has been in extreme decline after the flood and military disasters. The business conditions of various industries last year, except for silver shops which were able to cope due to the sharp rise in gold prices, all suffered losses. Although the money industry has scheduled to open on the 6th of this month, only Daosheng, Yuankang, Dingchang, and Chengyu have decided to open. The remaining companies have either dispersed their staff or are still waiting to contact shareholders. Rumors that Shengji and Yuansheng have decided to open are not true. Shareholders of silk and clothing companies such as Junji and Xinyihe have no intention of operating. Zhenhe, Yukangxiang, Taikang, Dacheng, and Tianxiang have not made concrete decisions. The oldest Jiangguang industry brand, Jiyingfeng, has had profits over the years, but also lost money last year. When the shareholders talked a few days ago, the Wang shareholder strongly advocated closing down and first laid off eight employees. At the same time, Dachangfeng also implemented contraction due to losses, leaving only four employees.</p>

Unexpectedly, more than a thousand people gathered from each Bao and stormed the bureau. The head of the bureau, for self-defense, ordered the police to open fire, killing one person and wounding three. The uniforms of all the police officers and the furniture in the bureau chief's residence were destroyed by the crowd. County Magistrate Yao Yanwen of this county reported the incident and went to the scene to handle everything.</p>

<h3 id="e100">Northeast Association Holds Inaugural Meeting Yesterday <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Elects Shi Liangcai and 26 Others as Directors</p>
<p>Plans to Recover Lost Territory and Develop Resources in the Future</p>
<p>Wu Tiecheng, Zhang Gongquan, Lin Kanghou, and others, recognizing the seriousness and importance of the Northeast problem, initiated the organization of the Northeast Association, which has been in preparation for several months. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, the inaugural meeting was held on the ninth floor of the YMCA in Buxianqiao. Wu Tiecheng chaired the meeting, which passed the charter and elected 27 directors. Details are recorded below.</p>
<p>(Names of Attendees) Those who attended yesterday included Cai Yuanpei, Xu Shiying, Wang Yiting, Chu Fucheng, Zhang Shizhao, Wu Tiecheng, Lin Kanghou, Shi Liangcai, Wang Yansong, Zheng Hongnian, Yu Qiaqing, Chen Binhe, Zang Qifang, Qi Shiying, Mu Ouchu, Huang Renzhi, Du Chongyuan, Lin Wojang, Wu Huanzhang, Jiang Songnian, Liu Piguang, Pang Yuedong, representatives of various Northeast armies, and more than 100 leaders from all walks of life and newspaper reporters.</p>
<p>(Chairman's Report) Chairman Wu Tiecheng reported on the origins of the association, stating briefly that the three northeastern provinces have 360,000 square miles of land, 30 million people, and countless treasures. Japan considers it a lifeline, and China considers it life itself. Without the Northeast, China has no way out. The three northeastern provinces have been lost for over a year. Our government has exhausted peaceful methods and the armed struggle of the Volunteer Army, but there is still no hope of recovery. Compatriots from the Northeast are coming to various parts of China to cry for help endlessly. Compatriots in the country are also actively providing assistance. There are organizations such as the Shanghai Relief for Northeast Refugees and the Liaoning-Jilin-Heilongjiang Volunteer Army Support Group. However, they are limited to relief and assistance. There is no unified organization. To save the Northeast, we must not only limit ourselves to relief. In addition, there are more important responsibilities. Therefore, we and others initiated the Northeast Association as a unified and permanent organization to save the Northeast. In addition to currently striving to recover the Northeast, we are also laying the foundation for developing the Northeast's resources in the future. This scope is greater than other organizations that only focus on relief, and the responsibility is also heavier.</p>
<p>(Summary of Speeches) Next, Cai Yuanpei spoke, stating briefly that all sectors in Shanghai have risen up to lead the country in assisting the Northeast, and there is great hope for the future of the Northeast. Because local associations have the experience of fully assisting the 19th Route Army in the January 28th Anti-Japanese War, it is a model for cooperation between the people and the army. We scholars do not seem to be of much help in the war, but in the Battle of Shanghai, scientists had an organization for technical cooperation, which achieved considerable results. In the future, we are still willing to do our best in this regard. Next, Chen Binhe spoke, stating briefly that Mayor Wu is very familiar with the situation in the Northeast and has said two things: "You don't know how vast China is until you go to the Northeast; you don't know how dangerous China is until you go to the Northeast." Chinese people study the Northeast after the September 18th Incident, while Japanese people study the Northeast before the Sino-Japanese War, a difference of decades. According to the Northeast Yearbook, last year the Japanese published 281 regular publications studying Manchuria and Mongolia, and 65 irregular publications, while China had only 38. Therefore, the Chinese people are far less familiar with the situation in the Northeast than the Japanese. The abundance of resources in the Northeast can be seen from the statistics of 1930 alone. Grain production reached 190 million tons, accounting for 20% of the national production. The Northeast is both a source of wealth and a source of disaster. Because the owners are not good at managing it, it has attracted the covetousness of thieves. The outbreak of disaster was before the September 18th Incident. There had already been two wars, the Sino-Japanese War and the Russo-Japanese War. It only became more serious after the September 18th Incident. Recently, Japanese Foreign Minister Uchida said in a speech in the parliament that even if Japan is turned into scorched earth, it will never leave Manchuria. This shows determination. The Japanese are willing to take the Northeast with iron and blood. We are determined to take it back with blood and iron. In world history, there is only the precedent of passively accepting oppression and national subjugation, but never resisting national subjugation. Finally, Ma Zhanshan's representative, Wu Huanzhang, spoke on behalf of the generals of the various Northeast Volunteer Armies, expressing gratitude and hope, and the necessity of fully assisting the Volunteer Armies so that they can maintain the source of power in Jilin and Heilongjiang.</p>

Its form is the same as that of the Bank of Korea, which proves that the Puppet State is completely colonized.</p>

<p>It is Heard that Chen Has Agreed to Withdraw His Resignation</p>

<h3 id="e103">Local Association Receives Telegram from Kailu <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>丨Four Enemy Planes Shot Down丨</p>
<p>(Telegram from Kailu) The local association received a telegram from Cui Xinwu of Kailu stating the entire story of the enemy's attack on Kailu in detail: Recently, the enemy saw a sudden increase in the number of volunteer troops and Jiang province retreating soldiers in Kailu, fearing they would advance on Tongliao. They used the tactic of defeating the enemy one by one, first using a large number of aircraft to bomb the county seat for days on end, causing excessive damage to our forces, which had no choice but to find a way to relocate. This left only a portion of the brigade commander's forces to defend independently. Then, they used a large force to attack the front lines. After succeeding, they were able to obtain Kailu without a fight. Then, on the morning of a certain day, seventy Japanese soldiers suddenly arrived, along with over a thousand Mongolian soldiers and Zhang HaiPeng's troops, accompanied by four armored vehicles. Later, tanks, planes, mountain guns, and machine guns launched a fierce attack on our Daodeyingzi defense line. In one day, they fiercely attacked our position three times, using machine guns and mountain guns from below, and a large number of bombers from above, bombing as much as possible. The number of our troops on the front line was less than a regiment of cavalry. The enemy's artillery and bombs completely destroyed the position and the Daodeyingzi regimental headquarters beyond recognition. However, our soldiers used cover and did not decrease in number, still calmly killing the enemy with rifles, mortars, hand grenades, and broadswords. Then, as the enemy planes flew low, they used rifles to shoot upwards at the planes. The battle lasted until about 6 p.m., when the enemy ran out of strength and retreated across the entire line. After a detailed investigation after the battle, more than ten Japanese soldiers and more than forty puppet troops were killed, and four enemy planes were shot down. One was burned by us, and the other three fell within the enemy's battle line, so they were transported back to Tongliao by vehicle. Thanks to our divine protection, only more than ten cavalry horses and five soldiers were injured, and the rest were all unharmed. Now, because the wireless telegraph was destroyed by the enemy's bombing, and the wired telegraph was also bombed in several sections, the telegram was delayed. Respectfully submitted, Brigade Commander Cui Xinwu kowtows with reverence," etc. Respectfully submitted, Winter Seal.</p>
<p>(Association Telegram) To Chairman Tang YuLin of the Chengde Provincial Government: Your telegram is just and righteous, and is being widely circulated at home and abroad. We have heard that the troops under Brigade Commander Cui of Kailu have repeatedly thwarted the enemy's advances, showing great wisdom and bravery. We deeply admire this. We will work even harder to be his support. We send this telegram to express our condolences and ask you to forward them to Brigade Commander Cui. We hope you will understand. The Shanghai Local Association kowtows, Jiang.</p>
<p>Dismissing Resignation, Details Recorded Separately Below</p>
<p>(Resignation Process) Since taking office, although Minister Chen had plans to develop the navy, it was difficult to make bricks without straw. Ultimately, due to financial difficulties, not only could the development plans not be realized, but even the current situation was difficult to maintain. During the January 28th Incident, the navy did not participate in the fighting because it did not receive orders from the government, which led to criticism from the people. All of this was the reason for Minister Chen's pessimism. Towards the end of last month, Minister Chen resolutely submitted his resignation to the Executive Yuan, and at the same time issued a notice to all his subordinates, stating the pain of his resignation and instructing them to serve with peace of mind. Minister Chen himself quietly came to Shanghai on the 30th of last month and resided at the Hui Zhong Hotel on the Bund. After President Song received Minister Chen's resignation, in addition to instructing him to stay, he also telegraphed Secretary-General Chu Minyi of the Executive Yuan, who came to Shanghai yesterday to convey the government's intention to persuade him to stay.</p>
<p>(Chu Minyi's Remarks) Secretary-General Chu arrived in Shanghai at about 8:00 a.m. yesterday and immediately returned to his residence to rest. He then drove to visit Minister Chen at the Hui Zhong Hotel and talked for about an hour before leaving. According to Secretary-General Chu, speaking to a reporter from the Central News Agency, there are three reasons for Minister Chen's resignation: (1) poor health, (2) financial difficulties in the navy, and (3) misunderstanding and repeated criticism from the outside world, so he resigned pessimistically. I was ordered by President Song to come to Shanghai to persuade him to stay and discuss the difficulties. The result was extremely satisfactory. Minister Chen has agreed to dismiss his resignation and will go to Nanjing to resume his post in a few days.</p>
<p>(Chen Shaokuan's Remarks) The reporter also visited Minister Chen at the Hui Zhong Hotel to ask if he had dismissed his intention to resign. According to Chen, since I have served as the head of the navy, I have not achieved any results. Thinking of this, I feel ashamed to the people of the country. I submitted my resignation last year, but it has not been approved. Considering the current time of internal and external troubles, the navy is of utmost importance to national defense, so I have decided to resign to make way for the capable, so that the navy can be expanded as soon as possible, and national defense can be consolidated. And my determination to leave is firm. After resigning, I intend to participate in the anti-Japanese war as a citizen. Recalling the Shanghai war last year, the navy did not assist the 19th Route Army in the anti-Japanese war because it did not receive orders, which I have always regarded as a lifelong pain. Because the deployment of warships must obey the orders of superiors, but the people do not understand and criticize each other, which is truly regrettable. Chen also said that the navy's finances are extremely tight. Although the prescribed monthly funding is 500,000 yuan, in reality only 400,000 yuan is received, while the expenses of various departments under the ministry are enormous, and money is needed everywhere. Compared with the naval budgets of European and American countries, there is a world of difference. It is imperative to find ways to expand.</p>

<p>He Yingqin's Liver Disease Relapses, Awaiting Treatment</p>
<p>Secretary-General Chu Minyi of the Executive Yuan, after coming to Shanghai yesterday to retain Navy Minister Chen Shaokuan, then went to visit Song Ziwen, the acting president of the Executive Yuan, to report on the recent government affairs of the Executive Yuan, and then visited Minister of Military Affairs He Yingqin to inquire about his condition. Later, according to Chu, speaking to a reporter from the New Sound News Agency, President Song suddenly suffered from a cold (severe cold) and had a fever. He is currently receiving medical treatment and will not be able to return to Nanjing for the time being. After being diagnosed by a doctor, Minister He's hemorrhoids have been removed, but the examination results revealed that his liver had the same liver fluke disease as President Wang, so he is currently trying to cure the disease. He should be able to return to Nanjing after about a week of recuperation.</p>

<h3 id="e109">China Aviation Association's Recruitment Team Has Started Organizing <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Two Lins Return to Hangzhou</p>
<p>Many Children Donate to Help</p>
<p>After the China Aviation Association recruited members and appointed Mayor Wu as the general captain and Wang Zhengting as the chief of staff, Wu and Wang started organizing various teams a few days ago to engage in large-scale recruitment. Two executive directors, Wang Xiaolai and Lin Kanghou, who went to Hangzhou to discuss organizing a branch, and Lin also returned to Shanghai the night before last. Lin WoJiang is going to Hangzhou this morning to discuss with Ge Jingen, the director of the Aviation Administration. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>(WoJiang Goes to Hangzhou) Since the association recruited members, the number of people joining and donating money has been very enthusiastic. It is expected that only Shanghai can establish two aviation teams, each team with nine aircraft, a total of eighteen. Therefore, Lin WoJiang, the executive director of the association, went to Hangzhou this morning to discuss with Ge Jingen, the director of the Aviation Administration, the purchase of aircraft models and other issues such as custody and use. He will return to Shanghai in about two or three days.</p>
<p>(Kanghou Returns to Shanghai) Two directors, Wang Xiaolai and Lin Kanghou, were ordered by the Executive Committee on the 31st of last month to go to Hangzhou to discuss the organization of a Zhejiang Provincial branch. Lin returned to Shanghai the night before last. Yesterday, a reporter from the New Sound News Agency asked about the progress of the discussions in Hangzhou. According to the answer, Zhejiang Province had already started preparing to raise funds for aircraft in advance. After we arrived in Hangzhou, we contacted leaders from all walks of life to discuss the organization of a branch, which was greatly supported by all walks of life. Because the articles of association and application forms we brought were not enough, they were not enough to distribute. After I returned to Shanghai, I sent them in batches. Mr. Wang Xiaolai will also be able to return to Shanghai in about two or three days. The Zhejiang Provincial branch will be established soon.</p>
<p>(Children's Donations) Yesterday, the association also received two children, Shen Cuiyun and Shen Guiyun, from 460 Rue Luber, who donated two yuan of their New Year's money to purchase aircraft. This shows that the recognition of aviation saving the country by the people of the country has become widespread and deeply rooted, and the future is very promising.</p>
<p>Huang Weigong, a fifteen-year-old student living on Rue Luber in this city, wrote to Mayor Wu yesterday, saying, "Dear Mayor, since the Japanese invaders occupied our Northeast on September 18, 1931, they attacked our Shanghai on January 28 last year, trampling on our land, slaughtering our people, and burning our houses. Wherever their iron hooves went, they raped, plundered, and did everything. And their aggression has not diminished, and they have occupied our Yuguan this year, with wild ambitions, eyeing our Rehe, Pingjin, and other places with covetous eyes. Their aggression against our country can be said to be extreme. The rise and fall of the country is the responsibility of every citizen. Although we children cannot wield weapons to defend the country, we dare not lag behind others in our love for the country. Therefore, we have specially gathered many sisters, brothers, cousins, and cousins to save money from our grandparents and parents, totaling 27 yuan in silver, 8 jiao in small silver coins, and 80 wen in cash, and send it together to help purchase children's aircraft. Although we know that the small amount of money is like a cup of water to a cart of firewood and does not help, if all the children in the country can save the money for buying sweets and snacks, then gathering fur to make a robe and piling up soil to make a mountain, we can build many children's aircraft. We hope that all the children in the country will rise up and work hard. Please accept our best wishes. Student Huang Weigong, respectfully. Details are as follows: Huang Weigong 4 yuan, 15 years old; Chen Baoda 0.5 yuan; Huang Weikuan 4 yuan, 13 years old; Chen Baochang 1 yuan, 12 years old; Huang Weixian 2 yuan, 16 years old; Huang Weimin 0.8 yuan, 10 years old; Huang Weizhi 2 yuan, 12 years old; Huang Weiyi 0.8 yuan, 8 years old; Huang Weiren 2 yuan, 9 years old; Huang Weihui 0.6 yuan, 9 years old; Huang Weide 2 yuan, 16 years old; Huang Wei 0.6 yuan, 9 years old; Huang Weixin 1.2 yuan, 12 years old; Huang Weiwen 0.4 yuan, 8 years old; Huang Weiwan 1 yuan, 15 years old; Huang Weizhuang 0.4 yuan, 13 years old; Huang Weihe 1 yuan, 10 years old; Huang Weiliang 0.4 yuan, 12 years old; Sun Shuyan 1 yuan, 16 years old; Huang Weiyong 0.1 yuan, 6 years old; Sun Jimin 1 yuan, 17 years old; Huang Weijian 8 copper coins, 5 years old; Sun Jishi 1 yuan, 14 years old."</p>

<h3 id="e112">Bank Clearing House Implements Continued Handling of Silver Dollar Remittances <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Handling of Sycee Transfers to Resume on the 16th</p>
<p>Four Types to Be Fully Completed by March 1</p>
<p>Expanded Site and Established Holiday Method</p>
<p>The Joint Preparatory Committee of the Bankers' Association, which also operates the clearing house, has been handling silver dollar transfers since it opened on January 10. Starting on February 1, silver dollar remittances will be handled, and the 5th Committee meeting established a holiday method. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>(Expanded Site) There are 22 clearing banks in the clearing house, including the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, and the Four Banks Savings Association. The office is located in the west end of the Bank Association building at 4 Hong Kong Road, the former site of the Public Debt Fund Custody Committee. Because the space is insufficient, it was moved to the Great Auditorium at the end of last month. The center is the manager's platform, the east end is the report platform, and the west is the clearing platform. There are 32 platforms surrounded by iron mesh on both sides, one for each clearing bank. When silver dollar transfers were first handled, each bank sent at least two clearing clerks. Since February 1, when silver dollar remittances were handled, each bank has sent at least three clearing clerks.</p>
<p>(Gradual Progress) A reporter from the New Sound News Agency met with Zhu Puquan, the manager of the clearing house, last night. According to him, according to Article 20 of the regulations, clearing banks should open the following four types of currency current accounts in the association to pay and receive clearing differences: (1) silver dollar transfers, (2) sycee transfers, (3) silver dollar remittances, (4) sycee remittances. When the clearing house opened, it first handled silver dollar transfers. Starting on February 1, it continued to handle silver dollar remittances. It was decided that sycee transfers would be resumed on February 16, and sycee remittances would be resumed on March 1. At that time, the four types will be fully completed.</p>
<p>(Holiday Method) The Clearing House Committee held its fifth meeting on January 24 and decided to establish the following holiday method for clearing: (1) The association's holidays shall be in accordance with the regulations of the Bankers' Association. Clearing shall be suspended on the association's holidays; (2) Clearing banks that take holidays other than the association's holidays shall not participate in clearing during the holiday period, but shall notify the association in advance, and the association shall notify all banks. Bills of exchange from banks that are on holiday cannot be submitted for clearing during the holiday period; (3) On the full-day holidays of Bund banks other than the association's holidays, the types of currency for clearing shall be limited to remittances. On the half-day afternoon holidays of Bund banks other than the association's holidays, the clearing time and currency types on that day shall be in accordance with the regulations on Saturdays; (4) When the types of currency for clearing are limited to remittances, transfers between participating clearing banks may be deemed to be submitted for clearing as remittances; (5) During the holidays in Article 3, the receipts and disbursements of the remittance current accounts of the various clearing banks of the association shall be handled as usual by the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications. Zhu Puquan, the manager, has already notified everyone to comply with the regulations yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Overview of Municipal Finance for Half a Year <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Expenditure of More Than 5.3 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Deficit of More Than 1.14 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Since the January 28th Incident, the vitality of Shanghai has not been fully restored. The revenue and expenditure of the Municipal Finance Bureau this year is still abnormally exhausted. It is reported that the income from various donations and taxes from July to December was about 4.2 million yuan, a decrease of about 700,000 yuan compared to the original budget income. However, except for the business tax, which has not been implemented due to the special circumstances of Shanghai, and the land tax, which has a relatively short collection, the remaining taxes, such as house donations, have no shortages compared to the budget. Even compared to the calculated amount in the 20th year of the Republic, there are surpluses and no deficits. The expenditure of various expenses is mainly due to the sharp increase in post-war expenses, totaling about 5.3 million yuan. Among them, the recurring expenses include party affairs expenses of more than 72,000 yuan, administrative expenses of more than 131,000 yuan, public security expenses of more than 884,000 yuan, financial expenses of more than 141,000 yuan, education and cultural expenses of more than 432,000 yuan, social expenses of more than 90,000 yuan, public utility expenses of more than 98,000 yuan, health expenses of more than 119,000 yuan, engineering construction expenses of more than 436,000 yuan, land expenses of more than 49,000 yuan, municipal expenses of more than 23,000 yuan, assistance expenses of more than 108,000 yuan, debt expenses of more than 324,000 yuan, other expenses of more than 58,000 yuan, and the recurring expenses of the Security Office in November and December of more than 140,000 yuan, totaling more than 3.111 million yuan. The temporary expenses include party affairs expenses of 3,000 yuan, administrative expenses of more than 535,000 yuan (the expenses of the Security Office before November were paid by the municipal government here), public security expenses of more than 462,000 yuan, financial expenses of more than 44,000 yuan, education and cultural expenses of more than 299,000 yuan, social expenses of more than 54,000 yuan, public utility expenses of more than 97,000 yuan, health expenses of more than 18,000 yuan, engineering construction expenses of more than 622,000 yuan, land expenses of more than 72,000 yuan, more than 3,000 yuan for each city area, assistance expenses of more than 8,000 yuan, and other expenses of more than 3,000 yuan, totaling more than 2.234 million yuan. The revenue and expenditure are offset by a deficit of more than 1.144 million yuan, which has been dealt with by the municipal financial authorities by raising funds.</p>

<p>Two Round Trips Per Week</p>
<p>Can Be Restored After One Month</p>
<p>Since the opening of the China National Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Beijing line, it has been quite developed, with three round trips per week, and both mail and passengers have increased. It is now learned that the company has suddenly reduced flights since this month, setting it to fly north from Shanghai to Beijing every Tuesday and Saturday, and fly south from Beijing to Shanghai every Wednesday, which actually reduces one round trip per week. According to Li Diezhuang, the secretary of the company, there are two reasons for the reduction: (1) too few aircraft, (2) too few pilots. Because the aircraft body needs to be repaired frequently, it can be used for a long time, otherwise it is inevitable that there will be danger. The pilots also feel too tired from driving every day. If they fly every day, the aircraft body and the pilots will have no chance to rest. It is impossible to reduce it to twice a week, but it is also temporary. Once the board of directors is held in the middle of this month, aircraft will be added and pilots will be hired to restore the original state and increase business.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Severe Cold Weather Causes Inner River Boats in Jiangsu to be Icebound Again <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>The weather this year is exceptionally cold, more so than in previous years. On January 10th, small boats on the inner rivers of Jiangsu province were icebound. Those boats in the Gaodian area were stuck for over ten days. Just as navigation resumed, it coincided with the end of the old lunar year. The first voyage after the lunar new year was met with another cold front, causing the inner rivers of Jiangsu to be icebound again for the second time. According to a source from the inland river boat bureau whom this reporter consulted yesterday, the prolonged drought last year caused the water levels in the various river ports to be very shallow. By mid-November of last year, some small boats in various locations could not operate due to the low water levels. When the severe cold arrived last month, shallow river ports were more easily frozen. During the first ice blockage, the ice chunks in the river had not completely melted when the boats resumed operation. Therefore, this time, with the invasion of cold winds, it was even easier for ice to form. The frozen routes include the Xili Line, Changyang Line, Sudang Line, Zhenqing Line, Changli Line, as well as other inland routes, all of which are affected by ice. However, it is not a complete blockage of the entire line, but rather only the shallowest sections of the river, accounting for about one-third of the entire route. From February 1st onwards, many routes were blocked and impassable. Some boats were even stranded mid-journey due to the ice. There are even more civilian boats being blocked by the ice than small boats. As of today, they have not yet resumed operation. Upon receiving the news, the various shipping companies immediately dispatched civilian boats carrying ice-breaking equipment and hired workers to the frozen areas, planning to break the ice section by section to open up the waterways. However, the ice in the shallow areas is over a foot thick, which is beyond human power to break. This plan has completely failed. Passengers who were delayed due to the ice have been taking the risk of stepping onto the ice to reach the shore and walking to various towns and cities. Their luggage and belongings are being transported by local villagers for a fee, who also serve as guides. The boats trapped by the ice have reported to the water police, requesting protection while waiting for the ice to melt before resuming operation. According to Mr. Zhang Jianfei, the owner of the Inland Merchants Bureau, after the second ice blockage of inland boats and civilian boats, the Shanghai-Suzhou, Shanghai-Hangzhou, and Shanghai-Lake lines, although not directly blocked by ice, have also been indirectly affected by the traffic disruption in terms of business. This is because the majority of inland passengers and goods are stuck midway and cannot be transferred to Shanghai. Therefore, the number of passengers and goods traveling on the Shanghai-Suzhou boats recently has been exceptionally low.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Mediation by Director Du Resolves the Merchants Bureau's Layoff of Dock Workers <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Each person receives an additional month's severance pay.</p>
<p>Payment available today, but only for union members.</p>
<p>After the Merchants Bureau announced the layoff of 101 dock workers due to financial difficulties, each worker was to be paid two months' salary as severance pay, one month's salary for January, and a double salary for December. The laid-off workers repeatedly petitioned the board of directors, requesting that all be paid six months' salary as severance pay. After the eleventh board meeting discussed this issue the day before yesterday, yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, the dockworkers' union sent Yu Xianting, Xue Yinkui, Xue Xingbiao, Hu Jucai, Fu Zhiyang, and Yu Chutang to meet with executive director Du Yuesheng and director Yang Zhixiong to negotiate a resolution. As a result, directors Yang and Du personally provided an additional month's severance pay to each laid-off worker, but only to union members. The union immediately reported this to the laid-off members, who all accepted the mediation by directors Du and Yang. It was decided that the union would compile a list today to claim the additional month's severance pay and notify all members to collect the previously agreed-upon two months' severance pay and double salary for December.</p>

I understand that you requested our association to remit relief funds, which we are currently collecting separately. Once collected, we will remit them together to provide relief. As for the request from various organizations and the provincial government of Jiangxi to include that province in our association's relief efforts, it was discussed at a joint meeting of our association, various Shanghai charitable organizations, and the United Association for Relief of Northeastern Refugees on the 2nd of this month, along with President Yu Youren's letter reporting the severity of the bandit disaster in Shaanxi and requesting inclusion. It was resolved that our association should also provide relief to both Jiangxi and Shaanxi provinces. This has been recorded. In addition to publishing this in the newspapers to raise funds, we are responding accordingly. I hope you will inform them. I wish you peace and good health."</p>

<p>Jiangxi Fellow Townsmen's Association to Hold Meeting Tomorrow to Discuss</p>
<p>According to Datong News Agency, Central Committee member Li Xiehe, regarding the case of Gu Zhutong illegally shooting Liu Yusheng, yesterday specially met with lawyer Wu Mai, executive member of the National Lawyers Association, to discuss the steps to appeal on behalf of Liu. Afterwards, Mr. Wu told the Datong News Agency reporter that Gu Zhutong's contempt for law and destruction of human rights was extremely illegal. Mr. Liu (Yusheng) is from Nancheng County, Jiangxi, and is from the same hometown as Mr. Li (Xiehe) and me. Mr. Liu studied under me in his early years. As a result of the meeting between Mr. Li and me today, it was decided that the executive supervisory committee of the Jiangxi Fellow Townsmen's Association in Shanghai will hold a meeting on the 5th to discuss how to appeal on behalf of Mr. Liu. Yesterday, I sent letters to Mrs. Liu and Mr. Zhang Yishan, manager of the Zhenjiang Ziqiang newspaper, to inquire about the detailed circumstances of Gu Zhutong's framing of Mr. Liu, and asked them to come to Shanghai within days to report the truth to all sectors of society.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Employees of Southern Goods Stores to Petition Today <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Decide to Form an Unemployed Appeal Group</p>
<p>Over seventy Southern Goods stores, including Shao Wansheng, Tongtaiding, Yuelaixin, Dechangshun, Tongfengxiang, Ruifengmao, etc., dismissed over 120 workers, including Fei Zugen, Yu Daokun, and Wang Shiliang, during the Lunar New Year. These workers, facing sudden unemployment and worrying about their livelihoods, reported to the vocational union and requested negotiation. After receiving the report, the union, except for Tongtaiding and a dozen other stores where members had been sent to mediate and resolve the issues, was unable to resolve the situation with dozens of stores, including Shao Wansheng, due to the firm stance of the employers. The union held an emergency meeting yesterday and decided to petition the Party and government agencies this morning. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>(Workers' Meeting) The Vocational Union of Southern Goods Industry and the Lianyi Society of Shop Employees held a plenary meeting of directors and supervisors yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM. Chairman Huang Benli resolved the following issues: (1) The employers of Shao Wansheng intentionally delayed the matter, disregarding the workers' livelihoods, and it was decided to petition the Party and government agencies tomorrow morning to demand relief. (2) It was decided to have the mediators try again to mediate the cases of Yuelaixin, Ruifengmao, Tongtaiding, etc. (3) Given the difficult livelihoods of the unemployed workers, an unemployed appeal group will be formed. (4) A special publication will be published and sent to all members to communicate information. The meeting then adjourned.</p>
<p>(Petitioning the Party and Government) The union petitioned the Party and government agencies, requesting them to provide relief. The original petition stated, "We are petitioning regarding the unfounded dismissal of over 120 employees, including Fei Zugen, by employers, and request that the Southern Goods Association be ordered to promptly reinstate the union to quell public anger and prevent labor unrest. According to a report from member Fei Zugen and others to the union, they have been serving in various stores for many years without incident. However, they were suddenly dismissed on January 29th, and they requested negotiation for reinstatement. The union sent a member to negotiate, but was repeatedly rejected, and the issue has not been resolved. On February 1st, the dismissal of personnel was announced, and all were immediately required to leave the stores without food or lodging. All members of the city were outraged, and an emergency meeting of the directors and supervisors was held last night, and more than a dozen people, including Yu Yaoqiu, Huang Jiabang, and Shao Wenyu, were publicly elected to come to petition, sincerely begging that you (department) (bureau) promptly mediate to benefit the labor movement and maintain livelihoods, and await orders urgently. Presented to the Shanghai Special City Party Department and the Social Affairs Bureau."</p>

<p>With the condition that Jewish people be admitted first</p>
<p>The Director-General of the Municipal Council reported to the Board of Directors on Wednesday that the Board of Directors of Hong'en Hospital stated that a donation was made in the will of the late Mrs. Remah Moses to expand the hospital's beds. The administrator of her estate has decided to donate 155,000 taels to the Hong'en Hospital Fund to set up four free beds in the hospital to provide relief to poor patients, but Jewish people should be admitted first. The donation can be accepted in accordance with the hospital's charter and does not require the prior permission of the Municipal Council. However, because of the Municipal Council's economic relationship with the hospital, this matter was first reported to the Board. Based on this report, the Board of Directors expressed great satisfaction with the donation and instructed the Director-General to inform the hospital that the Municipal Council welcomed the donation and would handle it in accordance with its conditions.</p>

The competition consisted of 200-yard standing slow rifle shooting with five shots, 300-yard prone slow rifle shooting with five shots, and rapid rifle shooting with ten shots, loading behind the mound and seeing the target. As a result of the competition, Mr. Meng Wujin and Mr. Ye Renping were the best, each winning the monthly trophy for two months.

<h3 id="e130">Plans to Promote the Sale of Stored Silk <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Industry previously noted that the sale of silk by foreign firms had plummeted, and the number of stored silk and cocoons in silk factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang was very large, making it impossible to sell them, threatening bankruptcy. Therefore, it specially sent personnel to jointly organize two committees with leaders of silk factories: the Committee for the Arrangement of Stored Factory Silk and Stored Dry Cocoons and the Committee for Sales, to conduct the work separately. It is learned that since its establishment last winter, the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Committee for the Sale of Stored Factory Silk, under the active promotion of Director He Bingxian, has sold 40-50% of the stored factory silk. However, the remaining silk is still substantial, and efforts should be made to make progress. Since Chinese silk merchants have traditionally relied on foreign firms to sell futures silk, resulting in many barriers, and since the European and American raw silk markets fluctuate from time to time, and the exchange rate rises and falls daily, it is urgently necessary to engage in direct trade. Therefore, the association decided to continue to handle the spot sales of raw silk, purchasing it at actual prices and dividing it into two departments: remittance and consignment sales, and directly transporting it to the American market for sale. The required funds have now been presented to the Ministry of Industry for allocation to Shanghai and were formally implemented the day before yesterday (i.e., the 1st). In recent days, manufacturers have been entrusting the association to promote the sale of spot factory silk in droves, and Director He has personally contacted them.</p>

<h3 id="e133">Social Affairs Bureau Strictly Prohibits Fabricating Weights and Measures <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>丨Those who hawk them will be dealt with according to law丨</p>
<p>The Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau instructed the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, stating the following: The Municipal Weights and Measures Inspection Office reported that its duties are the inspection of weights and measures, and it does not handle the manufacturing or sale of such instruments. The collection of inspection fees is based on regulations stipulated by the ministry, and the amount is extremely small, which should have no impact on the manufacturing costs of merchants. However, recently, a few manufacturers of weights and measures, taking advantage of the fact that various industries are now voluntarily adopting the new system and the demand for new instruments is urgent, have taken the opportunity to raise prices and falsely claim that a high inspection fee must be paid when submitting for inspection. Some have even fabricated the names of official instruments to deceive and hawk them, seeking exorbitant profits. What is even more surprising is that the Shen Xin and other newspapers published on the 22nd of this month contained a notice from the Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association stating that the required weighing instruments had been purchased from the Inspection Office by members of the association. This misunderstanding may have arisen because the association did not clearly identify the place of purchase, which could lead to the spread of misinformation.</p>
<p>Now that unscrupulous individuals are using deceitful words to swindle, it will only confuse matters further, and the city's efforts to manage weights and measures, which should have a good reputation, will be seen as motivated by profit. This will not only hinder progress but also damage credibility. In addition to the fact that the office will continue to collect weights and measures inspection fees in accordance with the regulations stipulated by the ministry, and will not engage in manufacturing or sales, and will directly send a letter to the Bean and Rice Industry Association clarifying the misunderstanding, and will strictly order all weights and measures manufacturers not to take advantage of the widespread adoption of the new system to raise prices and hawk newly invented instruments, it is appropriate to submit a document to you, hoping that you will order the various industry associations to notify their members that if they encounter the aforementioned price increases and hawking of newly invented instruments, they should report them to the nearest public security agency for legal action to facilitate implementation and deter cunning fraud. This order is for your association to comply with, and to instruct all industry associations to inform their members accordingly.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Measures for Issuing Practicing Certificates for Western Doctors <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>For those not registered and licensed before 1929</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Interior promulgated the Physician’s Provisional Certification Measures in July of last year, some Western doctors in the city who had not registered and obtained licenses from the Municipal Health Bureau before 1929 found that the Provisional Certification Measures were not applicable to them. They have requested the Municipal Health Bureau to issue practicing certificates so that they could apply for certification from the Ministry. The bureau then submitted a request to the Municipal Government, which ordered them to formulate measures for this purpose. It is now reported that the bureau has drafted these measures and submitted them to the Municipal Government, which approved them for implementation on January 23 of this year. The following is an excerpt: (Measures for Western Doctors in Shanghai Who Have Not Registered and Obtained Licenses Before 1929 to Apply for Practicing Certificates) (1) Any Western doctor who meets the qualifications specified in Article 2, Paragraph 1 of the Physician's Provisional Certification Measures promulgated by the Ministry of Interior (i.e., has completed more than five years of internship in a well-equipped hospital) and who has practiced in the city before 1929 may apply to the Health Bureau for a practicing certificate. (2) When applying for a practicing certificate, the following documents must be submitted: A. A certificate from the hospital where the applicant completed more than five years of internship; B. Documents proving that the applicant practiced before 1929: (1) An advertisement in a well-known newspaper before 1929; (2) A prescription issued before 1929, which has been filled by a pharmacy and stamped with the pharmacy's seal, after verification; (3) A listing of the clinic or hospital in a telephone directory before 1929, sufficient to prove that the applicant was practicing; (4) A joint affidavit from three or more doctors who held licenses issued by the bureau in 1927 or 1928. If one type of proof is insufficient, the applicant may be ordered to provide additional proofs. C. A resume; D. Two two-and-a-half-inch portrait photos. These measures will be implemented from the date of approval by the Municipal Government and will expire after three months.</p>

<p>Rations Distributed and Travel Expenses Provided</p>
<p>Four hundred and some male and female refugees from Xiangtan, Hunan, suddenly arrived at Hongqiao Town in western Shanghai the other day. Their representatives, Wang Shien and Liu Guiqiu, requested rice and firewood from local stores. The merchants in the town found it difficult to provide for so many people. Chen Dekui, the police chief of the town's police station, sent officers to maintain order. As there were no empty houses in the town, they were led to the Anguo Temple and Pengchang Temple, about three li from the town, for temporary shelter. Yesterday, personnel from the Municipal Public Security Bureau and the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau went to the countryside to distribute rations and provide some travel expenses to each person. Therefore, the local area was not disturbed. According to the representatives, the Xiangtan area has suffered from natural disasters and banditry for years, and the people have been displaced. Once the weather warms up, they plan to return to their hometowns to farm. They do not plan to stay here for long and intend to depart the day after tomorrow, heading west along the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway.</p>
<p>Shashi Textile Company</p>
<h3 id="e136">Shareholder Criminally Sues General Manager <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Accusing him of Four Counts of Breach of Trust and Embezzlement</p>
<p>Withdrawal of Shares Leads to Assault, Another Criminal Lawsuit Filed</p>
<p>Gao Jiaren, Xu Keming, and Li Yushan, giants in the yarn industry, raised 800,000 yuan in 1930 to establish a yarn and cloth textile limited company in Shashi, Hubei. They also established a Shanghai office at No. 25 Sanheli, Jiangxi Road. It has been three years since then, and the company has made considerable profits. Yin Geru (Zi Luzhi), a Chongming native, is one of the company's shareholders, subscribing for 10,000 yuan. However, Li Yushan, a native of Hubei who is the company's director and general manager, has never distributed dividends and has not convened a shareholders' meeting to report on the company's operating conditions and profits for three years. Therefore, Yin has repeatedly questioned him, but to no avail. Recently, Li even asked Yin to withdraw his shares. On December 7 of last year, Yin went to the company's office to complete the withdrawal procedures with Li. Li suddenly told him that he would only return the principal, not the interest. Yin insisted that this was not acceptable. Unexpectedly, Li forcibly seized Yin's seal and stamped it on the withdrawn shares. When Yin resisted, they fought each other at the time. Yin was injured in the assault and took the Shanghai Bank check for the withdrawn shares with him. However, because he had not received the interest or dividends, he had not yet cashed the check at the Shanghai Bank. Furthermore, because he was assaulted by Li and the clerk of the office, he filed a lawsuit against Li in the First Special District Local Court for assault. It is said that the case will be heard today. As for the embezzlement of dividends and other charges, Yin, through lawyer Ma Shouhua, filed a criminal self-accusation against Li, accusing him of breach of trust, embezzlement, and forgery of receipts, in four counts. (1) The defendant's Wanfeng Company has had dealings with Yan Deji for many years, but Yan Deji has had no dealings with the company. However, the defendant recorded a payment to Yan Deji in the company's accounts, which clearly indicates that he privately issued fictitious shares or used fictitious shares to secure loans for his own benefit. Now it has been found that 19 interest receipts are missing, which must have been issued with the checks, which can prove that the defendant filled in the fictitious shares privately, and he is suspected of violating Article 366 and Article 226 of the Criminal Code. (4) The defendant purchased a machine for the company and reported a tax of only over 2,000 yuan, but he actually took over 8,000 taels from the company, which is suspected of violating Article 357 of the Criminal Code. In addition to the above four counts, the complaint also alleges that the defendant took over 200,000 yuan from the company on various pretexts and requests the court to investigate the company's important accounts and minutes of the board meetings. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu Tingqi of the First Special Court summoned the defendant, Li Yushan, who hired lawyers Fan Gang, Fan Qisheng, and Xi Yafu to defend him. First, the plaintiff's lawyer and the plaintiff stated the facts of the complaint. The defendant, Li Yushan, stated that the company's capital was only 800,000 yuan, but the construction of houses, purchase of machinery, etc., required 2.5 million yuan, so although there was a slight profit, it was still not</p>
<h3 id="e137">Can Lifebuoys Really Save the Poor? <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>"Break Glass in Emergency"</p>
<p>Xu Fuming Distorts Meaning Due to Desperation</p>
<p>Breaks Glass Hoping Someone Will Come to Help</p>
<p>Xu Fuming, a 36-year-old native of Jiaxing, has been unemployed for a long time. He is now extremely poor and despondent, spending his days in idle chatter. The other day, at dusk around 5:30 PM, he went alone to the Bund and wandered back and forth along the Huangpu River. He then went to a pier, where he saw a glass cabinet containing a lifebuoy. Suddenly, he smashed the glass with his palm. Just as he was about to take the lifebuoy, he was discovered by a patrolman, who arrested him for damaging public property without cause and took him to the Old Zhabei Police Station. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Special District Local Court. The police lawyer, Ru Baoyi, filed a complaint against him for damage under Article 198 of the Criminal Code, requesting that he be punished. Judge Feng Shide asked him why he damaged the property, and his answer was so ridiculous and unexpected that it elicited laughter. He claimed that he had been unemployed for a long time and his life was extremely difficult. Yesterday, he happened to be walking to the pier and saw the words "Break this glass in an emergency." Since he had no means of making a living and was in dire straits, he broke the glass, thinking that if he obtained the lifebuoy, someone would come to his rescue. Those who heard this could not help but smile. Judge Feng explained that the lifebuoy was for rescuing those drowning in the Huangpu River and that "emergency" referred to rescuing the drowning. The defendant misunderstood the meaning of the words and violated the criminal law. He was leniently sentenced to ten days of detention, suspended for two years. After the sentence, he was dismissed. It was indeed an amusing incident.</p>
<p>Over 43,000 Taels, and a record of a sum of over 43,000 Taels received by the Wanfeng Company, the numbers are the same, and the receipt and payment are on the same day. Based on this, if the defendant did not falsely use the name of Yan Deji and privately used the company's silver of over 43,000 Taels, then the defendant privately paid Yan Deji the debt owed to the Wanfeng Company and transferred it to the company. In reality, over 43,000 Taels were taken from the company to pay off his privately owned Wanfeng Company. His breach of trust and benefiting himself at the expense of the company is clear. Moreover, Yan Deji declared at the last board meeting that he had no dealings with the company, which further proves that the money was indeed used by the defendant to cheat and enrich himself, and he is suspected of violating Article 366 of the Criminal Code. (2) The defendant recommended Jin Youyun as the company's accountant, with a monthly salary of 80 yuan. However, Jin spent over 15,900 taels last year. In fact, over 13,000 taels were transferred from the Wanfeng Company, a situation similar to the Yan Deji incident mentioned above. This situation is a deliberate damage of the company's property and is suspected of violating Article 366 of the Criminal Code. (3) The defendant is responsible for the issuance and safekeeping of stocks. There are many unissued stocks. The defendant claimed that it was for the convenience of issuance and asked the directors to sign and stamp in advance. Once these unissued stocks are filled in with the amount of capital, they are no different from formal stocks and are equivalent to cash. However, 19 of them have disappeared without a trace, only empty. He lived peacefully in Ruifengsha. Unexpectedly, his helmsman waited for his master on the boat, and when he did not return in the evening, he began to search for him the next morning. He searched for several days along the downstream coastal areas, Chuansha Bailonggang, Gaoqiao Donghaitang, etc. Since he had no trace of his master and did not see the small sampan his master was driving, he was very anxious and had no choice but to report to his son. After hearing the news, his son reported it to the ship management office of the customs, notifying the affiliated offices to pay attention to the investigation. He also went to various relatives and friends to investigate, and the news of his disappearance spread throughout Shanghai. A few days ago, he personally went to Wusong several times to search, but returned without any results. It was not until the 2nd of this month that a shamin came to Wusong to report that he knew for sure, so he went to pick him up by sailing boat, and arrived safely in Shanghai that night. According to his own account, when the small sampan he was riding in was chased by a raging tide, he recruited a sand boat to tow it back to Song. Later, seeing that the boat was heading towards the outer sea, he was afraid that there was something wrong, so he cut the tow rope and let it drift in the Yangtze River Estuary, hoping that a steamship or sailing boat would pass by so that he could ask for help. Unexpectedly, it was drifted by the tide to Ruifengsha and he had to live in the home of a villager and ask someone to send a letter to Wusong.</p>
<p>Can be offset against debts, and shareholders' dividends are difficult to distribute. Moreover, dividends should be decided by the shareholders' meeting. The board and shareholders' meeting is scheduled to be held on February 10 and 12, and dividends should be issued after the meeting. The plaintiff's shares were sold before the meeting, so he naturally has no right to receive these dividends. The official ordered the date to be changed for another hearing.</p>

<h3 id="e138">Jiang Xiuzhen Appropriated the Goods' Funds for Himself <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>丨Has Been Arrested Awaiting Document for Transfer丨</p>
<p>Jiang Xiuzhen, a 29-year-old Fujian native, served as an accountant at the Dehe Grocery Company in Fuzhou. The owner of the company, which has been in operation for many years with thriving business, is Hong Baoming, also a Fujian native. Last month, Hong handed over 9,305 yuan, 1 jiao, and 3 fen in paper money that he had collected to Jiang, entrusting him to purchase a gasoline ship and 1,600 yuan worth of white sugar from the local customs. However, after receiving the large sum, Jiang had malicious intentions. He did not purchase the goods as agreed but privately deposited the funds in the local Central Bank, transferring them to the Central Bank of Shanghai for storage and opening an account in his own name. Jiang also abandoned his job and fled to Shanghai, lodging in Room 8 of the Jiangsu Hotel on Zhejiang Road. Hong Baoming learned of this and reported it to the Fuzhou Provincial Public Security Bureau, which sent a document to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau and the Songhu Garrison Headquarters requesting assistance in the investigation. At the same time, he notified the Central Bank of Fuzhou and sent a telegram to the Shanghai branch to stop payment. On the first of this month, Jiang Xiuzhen, due to the inability to withdraw funds from the Central Bank, hired Lawyer Yang to go to the Old Zhabei Police Station to ask for help. The head of the police station believed that this was a civil matter and refused to handle it. The other day, the Old Zhabei Police Station suddenly received a document from the Songhu Garrison Headquarters stating the matter of Jiang Xiuzhen's embezzlement of a large sum of money. Therefore, they sent Chinese detective Wang Ruilin to bring Jiang into the police station, and notified the garrison department. Yesterday morning, they were transferred to the Summary Court of the First Special District Court. The garrison department sent Inspector Xu Pengfei with instructions to the case, stating that this case was telegraphed by the Fuzhou Public Security Bureau to the ministry for assistance, so please allow the transfer so that it can be transferred to Fuzhou. However, the official document has not yet been prepared due to the time constraint, and it will be supplemented later. Then, the lawyer hired by Hong Baoming rose to state the above situation, saying that all the funds were successively paid by the Dehe Company to the Fuzhou Nanfu Qianzhuang, entrusting Jiang to purchase steamships and white sugar, with Nanfu receipts as proof. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu said that the police station's role in this case is also to assist. Now that the plaintiff and the garrison department have submitted considerable evidence, the police station does not oppose the transfer of this case. Moreover, Jiang Xiuzhen is not a resident of the concession, please verify. When asked of Jiang, he also hired two lawyers to go to court to argue against the transfer and apply for bail. Judge Liu Yugui verified the confession and ordered that the case be verified again after the official document from the garrison headquarters arrives. Jiang Xiuzhen was allowed to be released on bail of 5,000 yuan pending further instructions.</p>

<p>Neighbors Repeatedly Tempted Her</p>
<p>Leading To Her Being Sold Into Prostitution</p>
<p>Sun Baichuan, a Nanjing native residing at No. 4 Yongshun Lane, Tangjia Bay, Nanshi, has become more depraved and does not engage in proper work in recent years. His wife, Gao, is only 19 years old and has a particularly beautiful appearance. She often feels like a phoenix following a crow. In addition, her husband does not seek self-reliance, and life has become increasingly uncomfortable, leading her to become more resentful and self-pitying. Gai Dingcheng, a neighbor, often visits the Sun family. Although he recognizes Gao, he initially did not inquire about her due to the suspicion of impropriety. Recently, he has discerned the lady's hidden feelings. Whenever there is no one around, he advances with seductive words, saying that staying with this poor fool will never bring happiness. If she can abandon him and leave, she will have plenty of food and clothing and endless enjoyment. The lady initially remained unmoved. After Gai seduced her again and again, she finally fled with Gai on the 14th of last month and was taken into the brothel established by the Yangzhou woman Wang Chen at No. 3 Yongan Lane, Guangxi Road. From then on, she became a prostitute, available for anyone to pluck. Although Sun Baichuan has lost his beloved wife, he does not care. However, his father-in-law, Feng, has lost his treasured daughter and has been searching for her all day. Since there has been no trace of her for a long time, he reported it to the Nanshi Public Security Bureau, requesting an investigation. Detective Liu Changrui of the bureau investigated and felt that Gai Dingcheng was highly suspicious. The other day, he arrested Gai, who confessed everything during interrogation. The detective immediately took the suspect to the Zhabei Police Station and dispatched investigator Yang Dechun to arrest Wang Chen and Sun Gao, who claimed to be prostitutes, having already received more than ten customers and having been renamed Aizhen by the madam. Not long after their arrest, He Yuntang suddenly visited the Old Zhabei Police Station to see them. Sun Gao recognized that he was the husband of Wu Chen, and why He was also arrested. Yesterday morning, they were all taken to the First Special District Local Court. Judge Feng Shide examined them. After the police lawyer, Ru Baoyi, explained the case, Detective Liu requested that all the defendants in the case be transferred.

<h3 id="e140">Morphine Factory Case Interrogation Concluded <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>German Continues to Evade Responsibility</p>
<p>Thorough Investigation Leads to Clarification</p>
<p>On January 12 of this year, the Municipal Public Security Bureau dispatched a police brigade together with the second precinct of the sixth district and solved a large-scale morphine manufacturing factory in the French Concession, detaining the German Bate, Chinese Tong Rongbao, Jin A'gen, and others. They confiscated a large box of morphine and raw materials, as well as machinery and other items. The factory houses were sealed and all the defendants were transferred to the local court, where the prosecutor investigated and prosecuted them. Yesterday morning, the judge Guan opened the court. According to Bate's confession, he is American, and Klein is the factory owner. He signed a contract with him as an engineer. It is a factory that makes perfume. I don't know about morphine. I only went to work for three days and was arrested. There were only three workers, and the factory had not been established or opened yet. As for the box of nicotine, it was discovered after I went there. When I asked the factory owner, he said that it was also used for making morphine medicine, so I told him to take it away, otherwise I would not do it, but it was not taken away, and I was arrested. Tong Rongbao confessed that he is a native of Ningbo and was introduced by his younger brother to a Frenchman to work as a worker on the 7th. His job was to sweep the floor and wipe the windows. Their sign was Shanghai Perfume Company. We only saw Bate. We sometimes supplied him with water, but after going to work, we did not get paid. Jin A'gen confessed that he is a native of Zhenjiang. He went to the perfume company as a shop assistant, introduced by a foreigner. He worked for a total of four days. As for the foreign boss, he only saw Bate, who could say a few words of Chinese to direct us. There was also a worker named Su Ruigen. The factory building has more than ten rooms in three courtyards, and the machines are in the third courtyard. We didn't see how Bate was making it, and he didn't need us. According to Inspector Zhang Cunde, there was also perfume in the factory, but not much. The materials for making morphine were found in Bate's box. At this point, the case became clear, and Prosecutor Zhang was asked to come to court to state his opinion. After the defendant's lawyer made a defense, the judge ordered the end of the defense and waited for the sentence.</p>

<p>Pregnant Woman and Child Also Grazed by Bullets</p>
<p>The morning of yesterday, at approximately 9:00 AM, in the Shuttle Alley, No. 12 Dengyun Bridge, in the city, Mrs. Shi, residing in the upstairs room of the厢房, left her home carrying her child to go shopping. Regrettably, before she exited the alleyway, two bandits approached her, intercepted her path, and forcibly seized one of the gold bracelets from her wrist. Immediately, Mrs. Shi cried out loudly, yelling "Catch the robbers!". The two bandits responded by firing a single gunshot towards Mrs. Shi, striking her in the leg. Additionally, the child's foot was also grazed by the bullet. Subsequently, upon receiving news of the incident, the police station of the second district dispatched officers to the scene. However, the two bandits had already made their escape, leaving no trace. The injured woman was transported to the hospital for medical treatment by police vehicle.</p>

<p>Around noon yesterday, a dredging boat from the Junpu Bureau was dredging mud in the Huangpu River outside Lujiazui in Pudong. Suddenly, the mud bucket dredged up the body of a man. The body was already rotten and the face was blurred and unrecognizable. The clothes, socks, and shoes he was wearing were also difficult to distinguish. It was estimated that the body had been submerged in the river for several months. It was difficult to determine whether he had been murdered and his body deliberately sunk to the bottom of the river to prevent it from resurfacing. The crew of the boat stopped the machine and moved the body aside. They then reported to the Customs Water Police Station, which dispatched a sampan to drag the body back to the river surface near the police station. The Life Saving Bureau patrol boat was notified to report to the court to determine the cause of death, and then arrangements would be made for burial. An investigation will be made to see if anyone claims the body.</p>

<p>The rent dispute in Xichongye Lane on East and West North Sichuan Road has been entangled in litigation for half a year and is difficult to resolve. Now, the owner, Mr. Chen Xiaodie, entrusted lawyer Wu Zhiping to directly negotiate with lawyer Lu Qi, the representative of the Tenants' Association. Only then did he understand the details and express his concession. In consideration of the difficulties faced by businesses, he generously agreed to special sacrifices. It is said that the conditions have been negotiated properly, namely, all tenants in West Xichongye Lane are exempted from rent for five months, and the rent is reduced by one month per year. Counting from January 28 to the end of July, a total of six months of rent will be exempted. On the date of signing the agreement, half of all the arrears will be paid in advance at lawyer Lu Qi's office, and the remaining arrears will be paid monthly with the new rent for one month. The deadline for clearing the payment is the end of April. The lawsuits will be withdrawn by each party, and the costs will be borne by each party. As for the tenants who have paid the rent in advance, they can still exchange the previously received rent receipts for the new rent receipts issued this time at lawyer Lu Qi's office, so as to ensure uniformity and complete the procedures. The storm has ended, and both parties are very satisfied.</p>

<p>▲Engaging in Strict Training and Guidance</p>
<p>▲Actively Promoting Academic Research</p>
<p>丨Paying Attention to Physical Education and Military Training丨</p>
<p>The National Shanghai College of Commerce has been paying equal attention to moral, intellectual, and physical education for many years, and the results have been remarkable. Since the last semester, the college, in view of the lack of real knowledge and practical skills in society, will intensify its work and strictly train students. During the winter vacation examinations, in the freezing cold and when electricity and trams were cut off, the college did not change its original schedule, lit candles, and continued the examinations. The spirit of daily training can be seen from this. In addition, President Xu Peikun has always been a strong advocate for academic research. In view of the uselessness of superficial theories and the necessity of scientific education, he will propose at the college affairs meeting to organize academic societies to discuss and improve teaching materials at any time. The original Industrial and Commercial Investigation Department has now been changed to the Research Department and must be actively expanded. It is said that President Xu, together with Directors Wu Yugan and Zhang Sumin, are carrying out an expansion plan, which will begin soon. In terms of physical education, President Xu has hired Jiang Xiangqing as a full-time professor to preside over everything. The college will soon form teams to compete with various sectors. Mr. Jiang is a well-known talent in the sports world, and the college's physical education has a bright and promising future, which can be predicted. Furthermore, the college was the earliest to promote military training in Shanghai. The daily drills are very strict. Therefore, when the Training Directorate sent personnel to Shanghai for a joint exercise last year, the college's performance was the best. It is said that from this semester onwards, the college will be even stricter with military training to live up to the expectations of the government and society.</p>

<p>Last night's two Group A games of the Shanghai Basketball Association were both hard-fought. Qingguang struggled in vain and lost to Tongji 43-36. The Eagles' momentum declined sharply and were eventually defeated by Shanghai 43-22. The results of the other two Group B games were: (1) Youyou defeated Shangzhong 33-16; (2) Jewish defeated Red Team 55-25. Tonight, there will be two more Group A games.

<p>▲Tongji Defeats Qingguang Starting at 7:30 PM, the first Group A game was between Qingguang and Tongji. After Qingguang opened the scoring, Tongji had smooth sailing and was invincible, taking an extreme advantage with 16-4. Qingguang was unwilling to be outdone and struggled several times, catching up to 10-16, but Tongji's momentum was strong, their work was intense, and they won the first half 28-16. Re-energized after the break, Qingguang's spirit was uplifted. Liang Guoquan and Lu Dazhen… score… potential… good… formation… flustered… offense and defense… clumsy. Therefore, the forces were even and the battle was fierce. Qingguang barely won the second half 20-15, but the overall result was that Tongji still won 43-36.</p>

<p>▲Shanghai Defeats Eagles At the beginning of the match, the Eagles took the lead with great momentum. Although Lu Zhongen opened the scoring for Shanghai, the Eagles' passing and layups were unstoppable. Chen Xizhong, Kong Guangyi, and Dai Boxiang scored repeatedly, and the score suddenly increased to 14-4, taking the lead. Shanghai seemed to be in a precarious situation, and hundreds of spectators were worried about them. Unexpectedly, prosperity turns to decline, and adversity turns to prosperity. At this time, the Eagles suddenly felt their sharpness greatly reduced, while Shanghai was like ascending to the clouds, and their momentum gradually increased. Lu Zhongen added another goal, and Feng Nianhua scored repeatedly, reversing the score to 19-16, surpassing the Eagles in the first half. When the battle resumed, the passing belonged entirely to Shanghai, while the Eagles were depressed and their performance was greatly reduced, far less exciting than in the first half.

<h3 id="e164">Lady Vanity <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>The unbreakable Lunar New Year sees many fashionable men and women showing off their new clothes everywhere. Does the impending national crisis diminish their interest? I gleefully overheard a very harsh "Lady Vanity" jest in the background, which I will write down later as a timely warning for illiterate women who love vanity!</p>
<p>Lady Vanity opened her gilded box and was lost in thought!</p>
<p>She has a genuine fur coat and a soft satin skirt, but unfortunately, a brand-new overcoat covers them, preventing people from appreciating her beauty within. Yet, if she doesn't wear the overcoat, how can she compete with other ladies in overcoats to see who is the most stylish?</p>
<p>She came up with a hilariously bizarre plan! She begged someone to write two notes, one reading "Genuine fur coat inside" to hang on her chest, and the other "Soft satin skirt inside" to hang on her abdomen. This way, her beautiful clothes inside the overcoat wouldn't be completely hidden.</p>
<p>She walked among the crowds, indeed attracting a lot of attention. She proudly believed that her plan was brilliant. However, due to the jostling in the busy market, after walking for a while, the signs on her chest and abdomen were squeezed off!</p>
<p>Lady Vanity, having lost her signs, could no longer flaunt her beauty within! She was frustrated, but then she smiled again. Why? Because she picked up two notes by the roadside. Being illiterate, she assumed they were what she had lost and re-attached them, one above and one below.</p>
<p>She walked into the busy market again, oh no! Disaster struck! The traffic was blocked! She was surrounded by a sea of people! She panicked and desperately called for help. Fortunately, the police were able to rescue her from the siege, immediately tearing off the signs and questioning why she was wearing these attention-grabbing notes. Lady Vanity, somewhat regaining her composure, reported the whole story to the police.</p>
<p>"Madam, you can't even read, yet you want to show off? The one you wore on your chest was a note that fell off someone's door: 'Honored guests, please ring the bell here.' The one you wore on your abdomen was a note that fell off the toilet: 'Gentlemen, please step closer when urinating.'"</p>
<h3 id="e165">My Family's Old Gatekeeper <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>— Juan Yun</p>
<p>My family's old gatekeeper is named Zhang, and he is over sixty years old. He served on the battlefield for more than twenty years. His hometown is in Hunan. He joined the Xiang Army at the age of nineteen and rose through the ranks to become a squad leader, with the qualifications of a company commander. He is honest and forthright, so we call him Old Zhang.</p>
<p>In recent years, seeing the rampant Japanese pirates and the precarious state of the nation, he often sighed and occasionally talked to me about his anti-Japanese war in the Jiawu Year (1894).</p>
<p>He remembered that it was the nineteenth year of the Guangxu Emperor's reign. Li Hongzhang was demoted to Governor-General of Liangguang, and Grand Scholar Wang Wenshao was in power. Urgent pleas from Korea arrived like snowflakes. Wang Wenshao advocated for war, so Wu Dacheng, the Governor of Hunan at the time, volunteered to be the vanguard, leading two hundred battalions of the Xiang Army, marching heroically out of Shanhaiguan. Old Zhang was a squad leader in the Fifth Battalion under Wu Dacheng's command, wearing a victory jacket and a martial arts headscarf, leading over a hundred infantrymen.</p>
<p>At that time, the Jingfeng Railway only extended to Shanhaiguan, and it was their first time using trains.</p>
<p>Li Guangjiu, the general guarding Shanhaiguan, was the bravest and most skilled, leading eleven battalions of the old Xiang Army. In addition, there were sixty battalions of Li Hongzhang's Huai Army, totaling more than 150,000 soldiers, including troops from various places.</p>
<p>Newly arriving at the front lines, their courage was tenfold. They won two major battles in a row. The Japanese pirates were pushed back to the vicinity of Haicheng. Once past Haicheng, it would be Korean territory. If they pursued their victory, it would not be difficult to defeat the Japanese pirates completely. At the same time, Liu Yongfu was also gaining ground in Fujian. Unexpectedly, Li Hongzhang secretly sabotaged the effort, strongly advocating for peace, willing to cede land and pay reparations, and secretly intercepting ammunition. His intentions were incompatible with Wang Wenshao, and he wanted to see all the advocates for war suffer a crushing defeat! He was so insane that the fate of China was left in the hands of one person!</p>
<p>Naturally, if Japan had been defeated at that time, it would not have been so rampant today.</p>

<p>— Recorded and Photographed by Zhou Yunting</p>
<p>Standing in Lakeside Park, looking up at the snow after the rain on West Lake, the white expanse of the lake is shrouded in ice and snow. The towering peaks in front are all silvery, like wearing pure white robes. Moreover, people exploring the plum blossoms on Gushan Island are gathering courage, walking in groups in the snow.</p>

<p>— Mo Yi</p>
<p>"Is this your residence?" The man looked at Zhang Rongjiu and said, "I am extremely tired from walking and would like to have some water. Please give me... Oh... Ouch..."</p>
<p>Zhang Rongjiu listened without saying anything, just nodded and went into the house to fetch water.</p>
<p>After Zhang Rongjiu went into the house, the man turned around, smiled at Zhao Tian, and said enthusiastically:</p>
<p>"If we join the Volunteer Army like them, we will definitely wipe out those wicked enemies! Like those three you just mentioned... What's wrong? Those three...?"</p>
<p>"That's right! We must fight to the death... Those three? Well, this is what happened: yesterday morning, three members of the Volunteer Army, carrying broadswords, looking just like Huang Tianba on stage, came here to scout the road. We told them everything in detail. Good lads, they really are something! That night, we heard gunfire all night..."</p>
<p>At this moment, Zhang Rongjiu came out of the house with a bowl of water. Hearing Zhao Da's careless words, he shouted loudly:</p>
<p>"Old Zhao, why do you talk so much nonsense? Did you see those three members of the Volunteer Army with your own eyes? You didn't sleep last night and are talking in your sleep this morning!" Zhang Rongjiu handed the bowl of water to the man and added, "Don't listen to him, Old Zhao is famous for boasting around here; he's just joking with you because you mentioned the Volunteer Army!"</p>
<p>A patch of dark clouds was blown over from the northwest corner by a howling gale. In an instant, the sun, which had struggled to emerge, succumbed again to the cloud cover, which resembled a smoke screen. The man slowly drank the water, his eyes darting across the faces of the three, a smug smile on his face.</p>
<p>××××</p>
<p>On September 16th, as the people of Chestnut Gully Village were eating lunch, goose-palm-sized snowflakes were rolled into clumps by the roaring northwest wind, landing with such force that they were almost like bombs dropped from a bomber, capable of killing a person. At this time, apart from three groups of yellow figures wriggling in the snow, nothing else could be seen. (3)</p>
<p>Listening to his words, I strongly recalled the anti-Japanese war of the 19th Route Army, so I closed my eyes and said nothing.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Cohabitation ABCs <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— Bai He</p>
<p>One cannot always embrace bachelorhood. As a dignified man, one cannot remain unmarried forever. Having a wife means maintaining a family and fulfilling the obligations of marital cohabitation. However, how to enjoy family life through marital cohabitation is a significant question. Now, I will share my wifely arts for readers who have wives but do not enjoy family life for careful discussion.</p>
<p>There is a saying: "Love your wife, respect your mother-in-law." To please your wife, you must treat your mother-in-law with the reverence of the Jade Emperor, without any disobedience. Her food, clothing, and housing are naturally indispensable, and you must not object to her drinking or smoking opium. Because of loving your wife and respecting your mother-in-law, you must extend your affection to her father, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, and other relatives. You must take care of them attentively. When your in-laws pass away, you must, without saying, mourn and conduct the funeral with propriety, making the later funeral even grander than the previous one. Even when your brother-in-law marries or your sister-in-law gets married, you must be generous with all the arrangements, even if it means going into debt.</p>
<p>As a husband, the money earned through hard work outside should be given entirely to your wife. This is a natural obligation. Even the deeds, IOUs, and accumulated savings from childhood must be handed over to your wife for safekeeping and management. A husband must not be selfish. If a husband needs to stay out late or has any extramarital ambitions, he must seek his wife's opinion beforehand. Because the husband is the wife's husband, he should not disregard her opinions.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the wife's life should be entirely according to her preferences. For example, if the wife enjoys socializing with male friends, the husband should not interfere. If the wife wants to listen to operas and eat gourmet food every night, the husband should not frown at her. If the wife likes to sleep until three in the afternoon every day, the husband is not allowed to make loud noises and disturb her good sleep. These are just a few examples. In short, the wife's life should be allowed to develop naturally as a matter of course.</p>
<h3 id="e169">On Ornaments <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— Guo Lanxin</p>
<p>Among objects, there are practical ones and there are ornaments.</p>
<p>Looking at people, there is also a distinction between practical and ornamental. Among the masses, some are able to establish a career, seeking happiness for the entire human race, the entire world, and the entire nation. Others seek benefits for society and the local community, thus living up to being a useful person. Yet, some are idle all day long, lacking purpose, ability, and soul. They are nothing more than walking corpses, ornaments among the crowd. Ornaments among objects only occupy space, but they can enhance the aesthetics and artistry of the arrangement. Ornaments among people are completely useless and consume useful resources instead. A group of these ornaments gathered together can lead society down a path of stagnation and decline, being harmful and not beneficial. Ah, these superfluous ornaments.</p>
<p>In these times of national crisis, as citizens who live off the land, we should all rise up to fulfill our national responsibilities, taking on the task of breaking through the national crisis. Walking corpses and ornaments should be overthrown and eliminated. Ah, this group of superfluous ornamental people will gather in those decadent, degenerate, and romantic places to indulge in pleasure during this period of intense national crisis, as if heeding their burial knell.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Shanghai Night Talk <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Ruogu</p>
<p>New Hawaii</p>
<p>On New Year's Eve, I planned to go to the Shanghai City God Temple with my partner, Comrade Huang, to visit Murocha. Murocha is an art scholar who praises the Temple as a cultural center. We wanted to invite him to join us, believing it would add a lot of interest.</p>
<p>In a square-tiled living room, two red candles burned brightly on an Eight Immortals table, with offerings of pastries and candies to the ancestors in the middle. Murocha was talking with two young ladies wearing black overcoats in the 1934 Russian-style. They were both genuine young ladies from the city and classmates of Murocha's sister. We were all acquaintances, so we joined the conversation without restraint. Carried away by the scene, we unconsciously drifted away from the idea of going to the City God Temple's all-night bazaar and the burning of the first incense.</p>
<p>Just as we were about to bring up the idea of going to the City God Temple, Murocha immediately said, "I am not against participating in this kind of public event, but I am afraid of being surrounded by beggars. If you are interested in joining the excitement, it is better to go together when it is dawn."</p>
<p>We were indifferent and did not necessarily have to rush to the night market. Finally, we changed our plans at the last minute. The five of us strolled along Xiafei Road from the West Gate, which was as bright as day.</p>
<p>At midnight, we were already sitting around a small table at the "New Hawaii" midnight dance hall at the intersection of Luban Road.</p>
<p>Outside, the wind was strong, and a tall black doorman in a thick overcoat stood guard behind the door. Inside, it was a different world. The fire in the stove was burning very warmly, and the entire place was decorated in a tropical style, almost making us forget that it was winter.</p>
<p>The ceiling was an artificial blue sky, which gave an even fresher feeling than the ceiling decoration of "Black Eyes." Three large lanterns with colorful patterns cast a faint light, as if we were in a magnificent Eastern palace. The four walls were painted in light green and blue, with several slanted palm trees and broad-leaved banana trees. Four colorful glass mirrors depicted four naked men and women. One was Eve, our first mother, in the Garden of Eden, holding an apple in her hand, leaning against a tree branch, her eyes filled with alluring expressions. Behind us was Josephine Baker, the famous Parisian dancer, completely naked, with a string of bananas hanging around her waist, dancing a Hula. To the right of the music stand was a picture of natives of Honolulu playing music, wearing white clothes and trousers, with garlands around their necks, playing the ukulele. A dozen or so small square tables were covered with white cloths, on which were coral-colored vases and ashtrays, and daffodils sent out a burst of fragrance. Several musicians on stage were playing popular jazz tunes.</p>
<p>The two young ladies from the city were surprised to see the banana dance image hanging behind them as soon as they sat down, and they said in unison:</p>
<p>"Such a painting is truly hideous and indecent."</p>
<p>Murocha replied, "Look at the slender palm trees, the broad-leaved banana trees, the brown-skinned woman, how healthy her body is! She is barefoot, dancing in the desert, how carefree and natural! This is a common sight in tropical regions. I think it is painted very well, there is nothing indecent about it!"</p>
<p>A White Russian waiter came to greet us, and we ordered three glasses of vodka, two cups of coffee, and a bottle of Shanghai beer.</p>
<p>The soul-stirring music, the sensuous portraits, the heat from the stove, and the stimulating power of the coffee finally aroused the interest of the men and women. Couples danced gracefully on the smooth floor. Murocha, who hadn't danced for six or seven years, and Comrade Huang, who hadn't set foot in a dance hall for more than a year, also accompanied the two young ladies in waltzes and foxtrots.</p>
<p>They danced until after two o'clock in the morning, still with great interest. I sat alone at the table, smoked five "My Love" cigarettes, drank two glasses of Shanghai beer, and listened to the conversation of three Germans and two Frenchmen at the next table. They were all in high spirits and seemed to be discussing some secret matter.</p>
<p>Because the two young ladies had to rush to their relatives' home in the City God Temple to eat wontons and dumplings, we left the heated "New Hawaii" before three o'clock at dawn. In the freezing wind, the three men and two women shivered and went their separate ways.</p>

<h3 id="e171">Financial and Gold Markets Extremely Dull <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>│Fluctuation of 4.9 Taels, Increase of 2.1 Taels│</p>
<p>(Fluctuating Around 90 Taels) Yesterday morning, according to foreign dispatches, London's short-term and long-term rates both decreased by 1.25, and although the New York silver price slightly decreased by 0.25, the long-term silver price only fell by just over one dime or several cents. American cotton did not rise or fall much. Bank private telegrams decreased by 1.875. The gold market opened relatively flat at 788.8 taels, and the exchange market also opened flat. However, people's sentiments were not very stable, and the price was first seen at 88 taels. Afterwards, because Zhaofengchang and others came to advance orders, the exchange market also could not settle at the initial opening price. The initial tight price was 0.0625, and the gold price rose to 791.6 taels. However, as the exchange market was unstable, and the HSBC posted exchange rates for England and the United States remained unchanged but fell, the price retreated to within 90 taels and hovered slightly. Moreover, because Zhongfu sold US$28.5625 for April at 88.7 taels, there were few transactions at the end, and the market was extremely dull, fluctuating between 9 and 90 taels. The market was initially flat but later rose because the Central Bank opened spot trading. In addition, there was a hearing of a small order to buy from abroad, which brought the price to 92 taels. Furthermore, because the long-term rate fell by eleven cents, the price reached 792.9 taels. The exchange market did not show much tightness, and there were occasional deposits and withdrawals. The gold price also fluctuated occasionally, but there was not a big turnaround. Transactions were not frequent throughout the day, and the process was also described as dull. Finally, a spot rise was seen, and the market closed at 791.7 taels. Morning trading was not strong. In the afternoon, because the Central Bank entrusted Hengxing with full power to open spot trading, the market was spirited, and many short sellers covered their positions. However, there were still few transactions in the market, and the trading floor was dry, which was sufficient to fuel the rise. The conditions in the morning and afternoon markets throughout the day are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>(The Entire Morning Market Was Always Stable) The opening price was 788.8 taels, because the long-term silver price did not fall much, and the exchange rate was slightly higher, so it was slightly lower by 0.8 taels compared to the previous closing price. Initially, because retail investors were all selling, although Zhaofengchang and others bought, it was only hovering between 8.3 and 9.3 taels. Hengyu Yifeng Yong slightly sold, but there were few transactions, and retail investors further pressured the price from the side, so the price fell to 88 taels. Yongfeng continued to buy, and the price rose to above 9 taels. The exchange market was slightly better. The March British exchange rate of 1 shilling and 8 pence 0.125 was not able to be settled. Hengyu suddenly advanced, and Dadecheng Fuyu and others also bought, so the price rose to above 90 taels. Zhaofengchang once sold orders at 0.05 taels, so there was a slight pause. Hengyu still advanced, reaching 1 tael. Dadecheng then sold, and Ruixing Yongfeng and others all advanced, so there were multiple struggles within 1 tael. When Hengxing came to advance, it was 1 tael, and Richang also bought, rising to 1.5 taels. Daxing Yonglai sold, slightly lower by several cents. Zhaofengchang also came to cover, and the price rose to 791.6 taels. However, the exchange market was still not good. Zhejiang sold US$0.0625 for May, and Fuchang sold orders to within 1 tael. Furthermore, because HSBC's posted exchange rates for England and the United States were unchanged, the gold price hovered down, and Qianchangxiang came to sell, reaching within 90 taels, at 89.8 taels. Zhifeng Yong slightly bought, rising to 90.07 taels. The market conditions were then flat, and transactions were slightly light. There were occasional sales of physical goods, at a price of around 90 taels. Shunli Dadecheng came to sell, and the price returned to within 90 taels. Adding to this, Zhongfu sold US$0.05625 for April, and the price fell to within 9 taels, at 88.7 taels. Shengda quickly bought, rising to above 9 taels. Because Ruixing sold a small number at this time, the price could not rise further. Meifu came to settle, advancing US$0.03125 for February, and Hengyu Fuyu bought to 9.5 taels. Tianfa Yong further advanced to above 90 taels, stopping slightly at 0.02 taels. Later, because Yuanmaoyong came to sell, the price could not be supported, and more physical goods were sold, so the price fell to 9 taels. Finally, the market closed at 789.1 taels, and the physical goods were auctioned at 9 taels.</p>
<p>(The Afternoon Market Opened with Spot Trading and a Slight Glimmer of Spirit) The initial opening in the afternoon was still flat at 789.1 taels, then at 9 taels. The market was very quiet. Although Shengda advanced more than 100 orders, to 9.5 taels, many retail investors sold, resulting in hovering. When Hengxing came to advance, reaching 9.7 taels, Zhaofengchang once sold orders, to 9.5 taels, but it was bought by Zhifeng Yong. Physical goods came to advance, rising a few cents. Hengxing continued to advance, reaching 90 taels. At this time, transactions were extremely few, and the market was also flat. The banks were also quiet, and the gold price was also stagnant. It once fell to within 90 taels, but Hengxing bought at a limited price, still pulling the price up. Physical goods came to advance orders from time to time, because Hengxing was also buying orders in the physical goods market at the same time, so the price hovered upwards. Yuanmaoyong advanced to around 91 taels, and still advanced to 0.05 taels. A telegram from Mumbai decreased by 0.02 taels, and Fuyu Fuchang all advanced, and the exchange market was slightly better at this point. US$0.04375 for March was not easy to obtain, only reaching above 0.2 taels. Not long after, Mumbai sent another telegram reporting a fall of eleven cents. Yuanchun Hengyu Fuyu competed to buy, and the market sentiment was very strong, rising to around 0.3 taels, and then it was still for a long time. Fuchang slightly sold, to 0.22 taels. Zhifeng Yong bought orders, and the price rose again by 0.06 taels. But Hengxing sold on behalf of its customers at a limited price of 0.29 taels, so the price stopped rising. HSBC sold US$0.0375 for March, and the price fell by a few cents. Tongtaichang Zhifeng Yong advanced again, stopping at 0.28 taels. Yuanheng sold orders vigorously, falling to around 0.2 taels. Richang also sold, for 0.15 taels. Hengxing came to advance orders again, raising the price again to 0.2 taels. Yuanheng continued to sell, but with Hengxing buying in the market, the price did not fall but remained flat. The exchange market still did not have any special aspects, and people's sentiments were not very firm. Finally, the price fell back by 0.03 taels, and the market closed at 791.7 taels. Physical goods were raised, and the auction price was 92.5 taels. Checking the highest price for the day, 792.9 taels, and the lowest price, 788 taels, there was only a difference of 4.9 taels. As a result, the closing price was 2.1 taels higher than the previous closing price.</p>
<p>(Spot Market Lacked Genuine Positions) Yesterday, the spot market's conditions were confusing and unstable. The initial opening was estimated to be plus 1.1 taels, then plus 1.15 taels, but no formal transactions were seen throughout. It was just a matter of traders easing the market with their calls. This was because neither the buyers nor the sellers had genuine positions. Observing the trend, the demand was relatively strong, and the price of plus 1.1 taels seemed to be a compromise.</p>
<p>(Forward Market Became Increasingly Deserted) The forward market was still quiet, the same as the spot market. The premiums and discounts varied, and the prices called were all between 1.3 and 1.5 taels, but there were no positions. The short side was slightly weaker today because the general shorts were unwilling to pay the premium of more than 1 tael. Therefore, only positions with premiums were seen in the market, while Hengxing Ruixing and others were reversing [positions]. (The spot premiums were all called at a price of around 1.3 taels. The spot was secured, but each spot had a secured amount, so the forward market became even more deserted.)</p>
<p>(Central Bank) The Central Bank was relatively quiet in the morning market yesterday, with no movement seen. In the afternoon, it entrusted Hengxing to open spot trading, for an estimated 630 orders. Hengxing then [bought] at [90 taels] and [92 taels].</p>
<p>(The Price Decreased Slightly, the [Spot] Market Was Strong) The posted price decreased because the [silver] price [decreased]. The [silver] price was still US$28.125, which converted to a gold price of 853.33 taels. It was received by [the Central Bank], which decreased by about 61 taels, a decrease of about 2 taels compared to the previous closing [gold price]. The registered price for this month was 790 taels, and the price for March was 789 taels. Supplemental water in the morning was 790 taels, and in the afternoon it was 793 taels.</p>
<p>(The Market Saw Intermittent Activity) In total, Hengxing Yongfeng Zhaofengchang Fuyu Ruixing Shengda Zhifeng Yong Tianfa Yong Tongtaichang, and others all advanced. Yuanheng Daxing Yongfu Chang Yifeng Yong Qianchangxiang Shunli Yuanmaoyong, and others all sold. Hengyu Dadecheng Yuankangxiang Yuanchun, and others advanced first and then sold.

The sterling-dollar exchange rate rose by half a point, and the dollar-sterling exchange rate rose by 0.75. As such, the opening prices for both sterling and dollar were flat yesterday morning and did not show any tightening. These silver prices had already been done the previous day. After the opening, there was a brief tightening because someone in the gold market was covering short positions.

<p>New China Products Company reported that the New York stock market on Thursday (February 2nd) continued to fall due to several companies reducing dividends. US Steel stock was relatively stable. According to observations by general speculators, the American Telephone and Telegraph Company is expected to reduce dividends when its board of directors meets on the 15th of this month.

<p>The yarn market has turned weak again, with a particularly weak upward momentum. This is due to the sluggishness of foreign markets, which has dampened sentiment, and the instability of the domestic situation, with tensions escalating in North China. As for the interior, commercial decline is dire, making it difficult to revive yarn sales. However, some are still strongly considering price increases due to the low base price. Based on the overall situation, there is a risk of further decline.</p>
<p>(Public Bidding: Flat Morning, Low Afternoon) In the previous market, the opening price for public bidding was flat due to the weakness of foreign cotton, but the residual momentum from the previous day had not subsided, and the market remained strong. Far-month contracts rose by 12 qian. In the afternoon, it was heard that actual demand had cooled, and raw cotton also fell, with each month falling by 3, 4, 5, and 6 qian. The total volume of transactions for the day was 15,600 bales. Sales included 1,350 bales of Jifeng, 800 bales of Dafu, 800 bales of Tongji, 1,100 bales of Yichang, and 700 bales of Mingde. Purchases included 1,050 bales of Changji, 1,450 bales of Senkang, 1,100 bales of Changfeng, 600 bales of Dachang, and 500 bales of Shenchang. The closing prices are as follows:</p>

<p>(Spot Yarn Transactions Quiet Again) The brokers' intentions were rather weak. Shenxin Factory opened with 500 bales of 20-count picked cotton, with a cash deposit, priced at 148 taels (including consolidated tax). Spot yarn sales by brokers totaled 310 bales, with prices falling by 2.5 qian. Brokers' purchase amounts are as follows:</p>

<p>The cotton market has started to decline again, and the strong momentum from the previous day has completely dissipated. This is because the Indian and American cotton markets remain weak. Indian cotton trading houses are still hawking cotton in the market and are very willing to make price concessions in order to find a way out, as the market is flooded with new cotton and sales are lacking, leading to increased hedging. As a result, the market has plummeted. As for American cotton, overproduction and sluggish consumption have also led to price instability. The Cotton Appraisal Committee on February 1st made no changes to the standards, which remain the same as in the previous period.</p>
<p>(This Month's Cotton Falls by 4 Qian) In the previous market, the opening price for Zheng Biao cotton was weak. Most people had expected American cotton to rise, but the telegraphic report was flat, greatly disappointing the bulls. The market suddenly fell, with each month falling by 1.5 to 2.5 qian. In the afternoon, bulls closed positions, making the market even weaker, with each month falling by 1 to 2 qian. The total volume of transactions for the day was 44,100 dan. Sales included 7,500 dan of Jifeng, 2,300 dan of Tonghe, 2,300 dan of Xincheng, 1,300 dan of Chunjie, and 1,600 dan of Yuchang. Purchases included 3,000 dan of Gengfeng, 300 dan of Dachang No. 2, 1,700 dan of Yuantai, 1,400 dan of Yichang, 1,200 dan of Ruidai, and 1,200 dan of Dafu. The closing prices are as follows:</p>

Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 6 points. The Indian cotton market was quiet and stable. Pingguoer fell by 0.5 rupees, and Aomula and Bairoxi fell by 1.25 rupees.

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were over 30 sources, but sales were sluggish, with only over 1,000 shi traded. As a result, the market fell again, with prices following suit. Su Tong varieties fell by about 4 jiao. Qingjiao varieties were revised down by 2 to 3 jiao. The early market for Nangang Hou Shao rice was slightly soft, but the market continued to fall by 4 jiao. Duyang Jian and Yinyuan were scarce, creating a tight situation, and market prices were able to hold steady. For factory rice, only Yangjian was priced at 9 yuan. Chang varieties saw no market.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 14 or 15 boats arrived from downriver. Baijing rice had sluggish sales because customers had profits to gain and wanted to sell quickly. In addition, scattered囤戶(speculators) successively sold, leading to sluggish sales and a market decline of 3 to 4 jiao. Slightly more Bo Dao rice arrived, with some retail sales possible at a small discount. Early rice arrivals continued, with more sluggish sales at a small discount of 3 jiao. Not many Yang Du Jian arrived, with sales still possible at a small discount of 1 to 2 jiao. Kejian saw a small discount of 1 to 2 jiao for Yinyuan.</p>

<p>▲Market Temporarily Stabilizing</p>
<p>Yesterday, both guest Xian and local Xian rice had active demand, allowing the market to stabilize. There is hope for further development in the local market because the river's尖米(high-quality rice) is currently scarce and expensive, and its quality is not as good as客秈 (Xian rice for guests or people from out of town) hence it is welcomed by consumers, and there are also囤戶 (speculators) who seize the opportunity to buy small quantities, making the outlook very good. However, the market's existing inventory has not yet been cleared, and new batches continue to arrive, so the owners are extremely willing to sell early, so without large-scale sales, prices are unlikely to rise. The market originally looked small yesterday, but because the local market was active and the Fujian market continued to see sales, it was able to stabilize. The Tong Market handled 584 bags of Jiangxi machine-milled late rice at 8 yuan, 9 jiao to 8 yuan, 8 jiao and a half, 1,000 bags of Hunan machine-milled oil rice at 9 yuan, 2 jiao and a half to 8 yuan, 9 jiao and 2 fen, Quanzhou handled 100 bags of Hunan machine-milled Yuan rice at 10 yuan, 6 jiao, Fuzhou handled 340 bags of Wu machine-milled Yuan rice at 10 yuan, 6 jiao and a half, and 300 bags of Xiang machine-milled red rice at 8 yuan, 6 jiao. Prices were similar to yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Very Little Improvement in the Miscellaneous Grains Market <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>▲Even Less Vitality in the Oil Market</p>
<p>(Miscellaneous Grains) Yesterday, all markets trended downwards. The green bean market was large, with the dish green beans appearing flat but secretly loose. The remaining types such as bright green beans and hairy green beans had already fallen more than before. Because owners are still trying hard to sell, and buyers adhere to the principle of only buying if it's cheap, the market was unable to stabilize. Yellow beans also continued to be revised downwards, and sales remained sluggish, but the source did not stop, and the market remained silent. The sesame market was also weak, but red sorghum remained stable, and corn was also steady. The owner of raw red high-quality goods tried to sell, but because the sales area market was weak, they also adopted a wait-and-see attitude, so there were no transactions. (Oil Market (Soybean Oil)) Because the production area reported small quantities, the receiver was helpless, so there was no market for two days. According to industry insiders, the oil market needs to shed 1 or 2 qian to attract buyers. Yesterday, 900 dan of Tongzhou Mao Zhuang oil was traded at 10 taels and 8 qian, with delivery in Shen in February and March, handled by a wooden street business.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Flour Market Still Flat and Weak <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, each month showed a trend of initial stability followed by weakness. The quoted price of foreign wheat fell slightly, but the market's sentiment was raised by the previous day's actions by 客帮(travelling merchants) (from Andong and Tianjin). People inevitably thought that sales would become active and prices would improve. Therefore, when opening prices, sentiment was strong, and near and far terms were 7 li and a half to 1 fen and a half better than the previous day. However, by the second session, sales by 客帮(travelling merchants) did not move, and 津帮(Tianjin merchants) also continued to watch, so buying interest was silent. At that time, some small factories slightly reduced their offerings in the near and far terms, causing the market to fall again. At present, formal 客帮(travelling merchants) have not yet started, but the production of factories can increase due to the import of foreign wheat. From now on, the key will depend on how supply and demand play out. As a result, this month's prices were actually 2 li and a half lower than the previous day, February's prices remained unchanged, April's prices were 5 li higher, May's prices were 5 li lower, June's prices remained unchanged, and July's prices were 5 li lower.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning the wheat market initially appeared stable, followed by fatigue. The opening, price of foreign wheat saw a small increase and the short, outside of the market, still were buying positions, with the months of February and March rising an additional 2 fen. Because, there was no one to maintain positions this trend reversed towards fatigue. The remaining months remained equal to one another. By the time the market opened for trade there was an inflexibility in the flour market, sentiment began to shake, and the quoted price for each month softened slightly. The factories in Hankou and Zhenjiang were heard to have established a purchase of Australian Wheat at a price of 3 Liang 5 qian and 7.5 fen. With that, prospects for improvements in the wheat market became difficult. As a result, this month was better than the day prior by 1 fen and the months of March and April were down 1 fen.</p>

<h3 id="e190">Honey Dates and Apple Jujubes <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>Honey dates are produced in Anhui, Lanxi, Jiaxing, and other places. The Anhui goods are the best, followed by Lanxi goods, and then Jiaxing goods. When making dates, white core dates are used as the base. The surface of the date is cut into many lines with a knife to allow the sugar juice to penetrate easily. The knife work of Anhui dates is the most exquisite. South goods stores have the title of gold thread amber honey dates in their market advertisements, which describes the fineness of the knife lines and the bright color of the dates, hence they are listed as the top grade. Moreover, their date base is also good, with thick flesh and small pits, which is their characteristic. The grade of honey dates is distinguished by the size of the date. Those that are neither too big nor too small are called tutus. Tuts are used as the standard when opening prices. For each grade above tutus, 5 qian is added. For each grade below, 1 liang is deducted. The names of the goods are listed below: "Huan Ding", "Ding Ding", "Ding Mian", "Da Mian", "Mian Mian", "Tu Mian", "Tu Tu", "Gong Mian", "Quan Mian", "Shang Shang", "Zheng Kui", "Fu Kui". For example, if the opening price of Anhui tutus is 20 liang, the above will be added accordingly. Then tu mian will be 20.5 liang, mian mian will be 21 liang. The below will be reduced accordingly. Then gong mian will be 19 liang, and quan mian will be 18 liang. And so on. However, in case of shortage of goods or excessive cheapness, the price will vary slightly. In addition, Fujian and Tianjin also have products, but not in large quantities, so they are omitted here.</p>
<p>There are also those made with the method of apple honey dates, called apple dates. They are large in size, good in color, and have a special taste.</p>
<p>Honey dates and euryale ferox and lotus seeds are boiled into soup, which is bitter, fragrant, and delicious. Other ingredients, such as mung beans and pastries, also use honey dates to decorate them.</p>

<h3 id="e216">The Strange Coachman (by G.K. Chesterton, translated by) <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Heng</p>
<p>The day I met the strange coachman was when I and three or four of my best friends were having a small meal at a small hotel in Sowerby. My best friends were either elusive skeptics or completely helpless believers, so our debates over drinks turned to the ultimate, terrifying thoughts. And the whole debate was entangled, finally thinking this: that is, the question is whether a person can fundamentally be certain of something? I think a person can be certain of something (as I told my friends, I roared and brandished an empty bottle), because if a person cannot rationally recognize a certainty, then what is this unrecognized certainty? If I have never experienced something like certainty, I cannot even say that something is uncertain. Similarly, if I have never experienced something like green, I cannot say that my nose is not green. If I really haven't seen green, maybe it is extremely green. So we shouted at each other, shaking the room; because metaphysics is a thoroughly emotional game, and the differences of opinion between us were very deep, as when talking about such things as so-called magnanimity or the development of intelligence. Because my friend had said that he unfolds his intelligence, as the sun unfolds the leaves of a palm tree, opening for the sake of opening, infinitely and eternally. But I said that I unfold my intelligence, as I open my mouth, to close on something certain and then close again. Just then my mouth was doing this work. And I enthusiastically pointed out, what a big fool I would be if I opened my mouth infinitely and eternally?</p>

<p>So when this debate ended, or at least when it was cut off (because it will never end), I came out with one of my companions, who somehow became a Member of Parliament in the chaos and considerable arrogance of the general election. So I sat with him in a carriage, running from the square of Leicester to the door of the House of Commons, where the police greeted me with special attention. Whether the police thought he was my protector, or I was his protector, this debate continues between us to this day.</p>
<p>In this narrative, maintaining the extreme detail of the facts is necessary. After my friend left the parliament, I hired a carriage to an office on Victoria Street, which I needed to visit, about several hundred yards away. So I jumped out of the carriage and gave him extra fare. He looked at the money, but not in the way that ordinary coachmen do, making people suspect that he was intentionally trying to rob. But this one was not an ordinary, perhaps not even a human, coachman. Revealing a foolish, childlike, and clearly very genuine surprise, he looked at the money: "You see, sir," he said, "you only gave me one shilling and eight pence." I replied to him with slight surprise, that I myself was very clear about. "But you know, sir," he said gently, pleadingly, hopefully, "that's not enough to pay for the carriage from Euston." "Euston," I repeated vaguely, because at the time this place name sounded to me like China and Arabia. "What exactly does Euston have to do with us?" "You were hailing me outside Euston Station," the man said with surprising accuracy, "and you said—" "What the devil are you talking about?" I said with gentlemanly tolerance. "I hired you from the west corner of Leicester Square." "Leicester!" he cried, revealing an extraordinary contempt, "We haven't been anywhere near Leicester Square today. You were hailing me outside Euston Station, and you said—" "Are you crazy, or am I crazy?" I asked him with scientific calmness. (To be continued)</p>

<p>It is rumored that cultivators can become immortals if they do not eat for three to five years. When I was a child, I also heard stories of cultivators who did not eat, saying that the cultivators sat cross-legged in a wooden cage by the roadside year after year. The wooden cage only had a small round hole for people to donate incense money. No one could get in or out of the small hole. Children and curious people often went to peek and always saw the cultivators not eating, living there. Although the cultivators disappeared later as people forgot about them, it was absolutely true that not eating could make one an immortal.</p>
<p>As far as I know, Westerners don’t eat much rice either, but they like to eat things like bread, beef, and eggs. Northerners in our country don’t eat much rice either, but they have to eat big noodles, corn buns, steamed buns, and boiled dumplings. If they don’t have these things to eat, they eat tree bark and yellow soil. Only after there is no more tree bark and yellow soil to eat, are they willing to become immortals.</p>
<p>I heard that in modern Western Europe, a kind of person has been invented who does not eat rice or become an immortal, and can also do what ordinary people do, but needs to eat a little electricity.</p>
<p>As for China, not wanting Western Europe to monopolize this, in recent years, a kind of person has also been invented who is unwilling to become an immortal and does not like to eat tree bark and yellow soil. They want to eat rice, but they have no rice to eat. They gather in groups, surge from here to there, riot and cause trouble, always making those who have rice to eat unhappy and restless. In the end, people feed them "deportation," and then that place is peaceful!</p>
<p>What to do when they arrive in another place? Naturally, they are still fed "deportation." Finally, they are fed "deportation to the world." After going around many circles, they finally become immortals!</p>
<p>All living beings, from the moment they are born, should see through the mortal world and cultivate to become immortals. Only then will this world be peaceful. This world is the heaven that we, who want to eat rice but have no rice to eat, dream of day and night.</p>
<p>"God, merciful Lord, please open the gates of heaven!"</p>

<p>— Jian Feng</p>
<p>In the past, people always thought that women were only good for being men's toys, and there was no other use besides that. Even Auguste Comte, the founder of sociology, said that men should support women. In other words, women have no ability to be economically independent. However, in recent years, the contributions of Madame Curie in France to chemistry, the authority of Mrs. Yarov in finance and journalism, the activities of Madame Kollontai in Russia in the diplomatic world, and the glorious new records recently created by Ms. Amy Johnson in the British aviation world – these facts have shattered the previous erroneous views of belittling women. As long as women are willing to work hard, it can be said that they have almost the same ability as men, whether in academic aspects or in general work aspects.</p>
<p>Before the October Revolution, Russian women were also in an oppressed position like women in other countries around the world. However, after the success of the revolution, their status suddenly increased, which is absolutely beyond the reach of women in other European and American countries. Women in England, America, France, Germany, Spain, and Sweden have undergone countless difficult struggles for the movement for women's suffrage and the right to be elected, but the freedom and equality they demanded have not been fully obtained. Although Russian women were not as enthusiastic as women in the United States in the past for the movement for the right to participate in politics, they instead gained practical equal opportunities to participate in politics. At the time of the outbreak of the October Revolution in 1917, it was declared that equality should be given to the general public; therefore, the distinction between genders was abolished, and everyone, men and women, shared the work together. As a result, women were fairly distributed in all aspects, and it can be said that they were almost in the same position as men.</p>
<p>Lenin once said that as long as women, who account for half of the national population, are still bound in the kitchen, no matter what, the nation cannot be said to have completely gained freedom. Therefore, the handling of housework by Russian women after the transformation is exactly the opposite of that of French women: in today's Russia, public kitchens are set up for eating, and cooks who are good at cooking are hired to handle the work; public laundries are set up for washing, using the latest washing machines, and employing specialized workers. Mothers hand over their babies to nannies in nurseries to raise after giving birth, and they do not have to work hard day and night. In this way, women in general have extra time to seek knowledge and can actively participate in work to promote social progress. In Russia, family life does not hinder women's careers. Women now have equal opportunities, and men and women receive the same wages for doing the same work. Men and women each choose the occupation that best suits them, so women do not have to rely on their husbands' economic support. Of course, due to physiological reasons, there are many jobs that are too heavy for women to do.</p>
<p>Secondly, let us observe in terms of political administration. Women participate in all positions: they all have the practical ability to handle affairs. Women account for 8% of the main ruling bodies in Russia. Ms. Kollontai's skills in diplomatic activities and her reputation are known to the world; there are many women in Russia like her who have talents. According to a 1926 survey, there were 146 female judges and 20 female prosecutors in Russia, and the number has increased significantly in recent years. From the electrical industry to various industries, women participate in them, and the front line of women's occupations is expanding day by day.</p>
<p>In terms of education, male and female students in all universities enjoy equal rights, and it seems that they will surpass the universities in other European and American countries, which is envious of university students in other European and American countries. Russian women certainly do not hope that a few women will occupy high positions or show off. Their highest goal is to promote the development of the entire society; what they are doing day and night is for this purpose. Gorky once said that Russia is not aimed at material completion as the ultimate goal; in addition, it must build a sound spiritual culture. Russian women are now working together with men to bravely move forward on this road, in order to carry out their ideals.</p>

<p>— Ms. Wen Juan</p>
<p>The round-domed buildings on the east side, the more exquisitely built ones, are the sites of the science and engineering colleges. Many experimental equipment are displayed in the circular auditorium. The library and classrooms are also much wider than those of the liberal arts college. We saw this place in a cursory manner, and we couldn't help but feel admiration for the appearance of the university. However, this solemn appearance can't match the magic power of the gentle autumn waves of East Lake, which makes us have to abandon Wuhan University and run to the side of East Lake; the water in the lake is really lovely, calm and clear. The autumn sky does not have her elegance, and the beautiful eyes of a beauty do not have her affection. She has an evergreen youth, a pure and flawless heart. The misty twilight covers her with a layer of soft veil, and the slender shadows of the sails paint her a pure white and delicate soul. At this time, it is exactly the time when the evening glow shines on the water and the twilight is vast. Her color slightly shows some blurred red halo and light green phantom. The white smoke pushes the sky light on the edge of the water gradually farther and farther, and the glory of the setting sun replaces the previous scene, applying a touch of rouge to the lake waves. Therefore, the twilight smoke is woven into the shadows of the clouds, and the white seagulls are woven into the peaceful sky, making it impossible to distinguish the boundary between water and sky, red-purple and light green. However, all this dyeing and all this transfiguration are all for the sake of this lake's heart. The smile disappears as soon as it appears, and it loses its own face, disappearing to the land of nothingness. This clear virgin heart still restores her original purity without being affected in the slightest.</p>
<p>Looking west, the setting sun has changed from deep yellow to crimson. This completely round sun stands proudly in the vast space. Above her is the bright blue sky, without a cloud blocking her way, and below her is a ring of bluish-green mist, waiting for the shining of her glory, which can create her pink future. However, a thin fence has been built around this beautiful fireball, as if unwilling to share the light with others! The faint trace of Hongshan below and the vast twilight hold up this crimson setting sun together, standing faintly on the western horizon. The mysterious light, the subtle color... "Even if Froebel were resurrected, I am afraid he would not be able to use the most appropriate and only words to describe even one ten-thousandth of it," C said, sighing slightly.</p>
<p>The young N and H seemed a little bored that we were so fascinated by the scenery. They said, "It's very close to Zhuodao Spring here. Why don't we go play for a while? Let's go now, there's still time."</p>
<p>I also agreed happily. But after setting off, my heart felt hesitant again, but after all, I had already gone halfway, and it was impossible not to go.</p>
<p>I broke off a few wild camellias along the way. The white petals still retained the past beauty. I carefully inserted them into the lapel of my clothes. Passing through several pine forests, it was a pity that there was no wind that day, so I could not hear the secluded rhyme of the pine waves. But I saw the lush green shade all over the ground. The ancient trees towered into the sky. This is the most densely forested place in Luojia Mountain.</p>
<p>"This area is very good, but it's a bit too gloomy. It's a bit like a small poem by Hardy, where beauty and sadness are mixed together," C said quietly. He is good at foreign literature, so foreign writers' names always come out of his mouth as soon as he opens it.</p>
<p>While we were talking, N and H had already jumped over the stone archway, running and jumping. (To be continued)</p>

<p>"How can we students go to such a money pit?"</p>
<p>The reason for his protest was quite grand and dignified. He thought that refusing like this could gain her sympathy and cover up his frugality.</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter, it's just a performance," going once or twice a month is nothing... Oh, I really want to play!"</p>
<p>Finally, she said coquettishly. She also told him that Professor Zeng Bingyuan used to take her to the dance hall once every Saturday when he was in Shanghai. Otherwise, they could not renew the happy feelings between them.</p>
<p>"Mr. Lin, let's go. Can I be your partner?"</p>
<p>After he said that, he giggled again.</p>

<p>He showed a hesitant look.</p>
<p>"Mr. Lin, you are too feminine. We dance together upright, even if your Mr. Zeng sees it, he won't be angry. Are you still afraid of what others will say? Dancing is a noble art of modern times!"</p>

<h3 id="e221">Clearly Recognize the Way Out and the Dead End! <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>The way out is the bright path to seek survival from death, the dead end is to run wildly at will, regardless of gains and losses, and go straight into the dark tunnel of hell. Between heaven and earth, these two roads are parallel and side by side everywhere. People in the world do not observe carefully, and move forward blindly. If they are lucky, they will reach the paradise, and if they are unlucky, they will fall into hell. The two roads are dangerous, and it is necessary to recognize them as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Reviewing the past and verifying the present, whether it is the personal life and career, or the rise and fall and survival of a country and nation in both hemispheres, whenever a problem is at hand, the prerequisite is to immediately distinguish the way out from the dead end? With the prerequisite conditions, there is hope for the result of victory; otherwise, if the eyebrows are on fire, and you only care about the present, and blindly follow the muddleheaded way, not only will the result of victory not be achieved in the future, but even the hope of survival will not be grasped.</p>
<p>Readers, please do not doubt that my words are close to being arbitrary. May I ask Yuan Shikai in the early years of the Republic of China: If he did not take the dead end of a family world? Not only would he not be notorious for thousands of years, but he would also be famous in the history books, comparable to Washington of the United States. It is also a pity for those suicidal compatriots who take their lives lightly in recent times. The reason why they take their lives lightly is that they are all aware of themselves and have entered a fork in the road that cannot be recovered. However, if an individual goes astray, they can still seek other interests and do not have to die. If a certain country and nation makes a mistake in policy and doctrine, resulting in entering a fork in the road and a dead end, that is destined to be a disaster for the country. For example, pre-war Germany, if it did not dream of military aggression, how could it have declined to the present level? Based on these precedents, I can prove that the remnants of the former Qing Dynasty丨Puyi丨Zheng Xiaoxu, etc., are heading into the dark tunnel of hell, and Japan is also eager to taste the spicy taste of Germany after the European war.</p>
<p>Now our national crisis is urgent, as dangerous as stacked eggs. Which way can we go? I have clearly recognized "Out of the Pass"! Furthermore, with 120,000 points of sincerity, I advise the compatriots who are preparing to commit suicide not to make meaningless sacrifices, the corrupt and inferior local tyrants not to specialize in their own pockets, the old and new warlords not to blindly fight privately, the green forest bandits and communists not to arbitrarily make trouble, the important party and national figures not to each have their own opinions, and the senior military officers not to be timid and cowardly. Everyone should hold on to the doctrine of "rather be a shattered jade than a complete tile" 丨immediately mobilize, whether it is a big gun, a small gun, a Green Dragon Crescent Blade, or a knife for slaughtering chickens and cows, gather them all together and kill them out of the pass together丨丨Fight to the death with the enemy丨In the future, even if we are unfortunate and die in the natural large refrigerator-like place outside the pass? I believe that our bones can be preserved for a longer time without decay 丨We swear not to stop until we achieve the goal of restoring our lost territories丨This method is the only broad and correct way for the Chinese nation to seek survival.</p>
<p>Otherwise, if we still cling to the biased view of "first secure the interior, then resist foreign aggression"? I dare say that the interior will not be secured, and the country will perish first.</p>
<p>Way out! Dead end丨Paradise! Hell丨Compatriots, recognize clearly.</p>

<p>— Anonymous Layman</p>
<p>Sorrowful clouds envelop the sky. Bitter rain strikes tens of thousands of tiles. Flowing into clear springs. As if facing a thousand-foot waterfall. Carriages and cars are still numerous. Hurrying and stumbling along. Thinking, what are they busy with? I fear it is not for the country and society. Turning my head to look at western Liaoning. Beacon smoke is filling the wilderness. Japanese cavalry ask for the thoughts of returning. Their eyes are gleaming fiercely. The governing officials are still complacent. Closing their eyes and feigning deafness and muteness. Brave men abandon life and death. Resolved to rise and fall in the struggle. Cutting down generals and recovering border flags. Not willing to give up an inch of land. The isolated army knows it is difficult to hold on. Still riding their noble steeds. Even commoners can show loyalty. Shaming those who eat their fill. The golden wind stirs my feelings. Two lines of hot tears fall.</p>

<p>(V) Bakelite</p>
<p>Bakelite is named so because it's a non-conductive material often used in electrical appliances. It's also named so because of its tough texture, lightness, and ease of carving, resembling wood. In reality, it's a product of the chemical industry. Its main raw material is carbonic acid, supplemented by rosin, sulfur, sulfuric acid, carbolic acid, etc. It can be made into various patterns and colors. Its properties, besides being non-conductive and tough, include being shatterproof and unbreakable. However, it is extremely vulnerable to fire, which is its only weakness and cause of destruction. Its uses are widespread: accessories for electrical appliances, fountain pen barrels, other decorations, daily utensils, etc., all require bakelite.</p>
<p>(VI) Refined Steel</p>
<p>On the market, there are silver-gray, shiny metal daily utensils, such as woks and spatulas for gas stoves, as well as rice cookers, rice bowls, and mirror frames. These are all made of this material, commonly called "refined steel." But what is it really? It's not steel at all, let alone "refined." It's cast from another metal – aluminum. Aluminum has a specific gravity of 2.7, making it one of the lightest metals. It's ductile and can be pressed into extremely thin sheets, and its melting point is high, above 650 degrees Celsius. This is why it's chosen for manufacturing daily furniture. Furthermore, it has a protective layer of aluminum oxide (Al2O3) covering the surface. This layer of aluminum oxide prevents the aluminum underneath from being oxidized or corroded by air, while the exterior forms a shiny, silver-gray appearance, making it both aesthetically pleasing and durable, truly a great achievement of science. However, be careful when using it not to cook foods with excessive salt content. Salt easily dissolves in water, and in large quantities, it undergoes chemical reactions to produce caustic soda, hydrochloric acid, caustic magnesia, etc., all of which are strong substances that can corrode the aluminum oxide and even the aluminum underneath. Because the "refined steel" utensils are often made of extremely thin aluminum foil, people often find their rice cookers, woks, etc., corroded and leaking. This is a drawback of "refined steel."</p>
<p>(VII) Chalk</p>
<p>Chalk, also known as whiting, is indispensable in schools. Its chemical name is calcium carbonate, a compound of lime suspension and carbonic acid. Although it's a very simple chemical reaction, the scale of manufacturing is not small due to scientific conditions. Besides being used for writing on blackboards, chalk has a great water absorption capacity, so many students in schools use it to replace blotting paper. If you don't believe it, try it and you'll see it's true.</p>
<p>(VIII) Carborundum</p>
<p>Carborundum is a crystalline form of carbon related to diamond. Carborundum is a compound of carbon, but it is not a diamond. Its process involves using a resistance furnace, placing layers of sand and carbon chips between the two electrodes. When current passes through, the resistance generates enormous high-temperature heat, causing the sand (silicon dioxide) and carbon to combine and form this carborundum. Its formula is SiC. It is an extremely hard material. The small particles used by ordinary shops to cut glass are made of this carborundum material. Its powder, when mixed with other viscous substances, can be placed in molds to create grinding stones essential in metalworking factories. Therefore, this is an extremely useful product. It also has an advantage: unlike diamonds, which melt when exposed to fire, it is a product of furnaces and is not afraid of small fires. You can place it anywhere without worrying about it!</p>

<p>— Flood</p>
<p>Gongs, drums, and firecrackers sound all day long, and people are celebrating the happy New Year with beaming faces. Alas! They have probably forgotten the bloody battle of Shanghai last year, the brave fighting and flesh flying of our loyal soldiers, and the displacement and devastation of the people in the war zone! Otherwise, how could they be so happy?</p>
<p>According to recent news reports, Japan continues to increase its troops near the Yuguan Pass in Rehe, actively implementing its consistent continental policy, preparing to invade Jehol on a large scale. What are the gentlemen who are constantly shouting "Resist humiliation and save the country, long-term resistance" actually planning to do?</p>
<p>As usual, before the movie starts, there are many advertisements, either for winter supplements or the opening of X restaurant at discounted prices. Now, the first thing that comes into our view is a New Year's greeting advertisement: "Happy New Year... Do not forget national humiliation." Cinema boss! You really can't stand this China with its internal troubles and external threats, so you have to put a few striking words on the screen to stimulate the audience to do something? No, I think it is because you are pursuing your so-called "entertainment does not forget to save the country, saving the country does not forget entertainment" with such painstaking effort! You smart boss! How can we not bow down to you!</p>
<p>Originally, Mrs. Cheng, who always takes a car, doesn't know why, but today she also advocates exercise and uses her honorable legs. This is at midnight. She pointed and said: "These prostitutes standing in the whistling north wind will not feel the pain of life. If they can feel it, why not use their omnipotent hands to work? So there is no need to pity them at all." So after hearing this, I was speechless.</p>
<p>The ×× lottery has already been drawn. Of course, everyone's mind is full of hope of winning the lottery, dreaming of gold. But now, the majority has turned from hope to disappointment. Friends! Please wake up and stop indulging in dreams of gold! The transformation of the times has gradually amplified its dazzling brilliance. Why not find the path you should take?</p>

<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>I have a very difficult problem to solve, and I am telling you about it; please give me clear guidance. The thing is this: the house I live in is my own: because it is too big, I have called in a few tenants. One of them is surnamed Wang, and she is a distant relative of ours. There are only two of them, a mother and daughter; the mother is about forty years old, and the daughter is only seventeen years old; their male master has been dead for a long time. They have lived in our house for many years; before I came out to do business, I lived at home every day and kept this woman company, so the two sides actually developed love. In the year she was fifteen years old, I also had physical relations with her. At that time, the two sides were so affectionate and entangled, full of the idea of "lovers eventually becoming dependents." Now I have a business and have to leave her. Unexpectedly, she has completely changed her former character. All day long, she runs outside; and six or seven days out of ten, she even stays outside at night; looking at her behavior, it seems that she has another lover. I went back last time to advise her, but she still didn't listen; and I heard that it is even worse now. So I wrote a letter to her to break up with her; I didn't expect her reply to say, "I must marry you, and if you don't allow it, I will solve it legally, or I will commit suicide."</p>
<p>Dear Editor: I absolutely do not want to marry her, and my parents cannot agree to this marriage either. But after breaking up with her, if she sues me in court, will I be charged with the regulations of rape of an underage girl? Or if she does not sue in court and really commits suicide, then her mother will certainly report me. Then what is my sin? Please tell me clearly, and also teach me how to deal with myself. Finally, I have to state that I am nine years older than her. (End excerpt)</p>
<p>Respectfully, Chen Mengqiao</p>
<p>○○○</p>
<p>Editor's Note: After reading Mr. Chen's letter, we fully understand the pain in his heart at the moment. But after much research, we finally feel that we cannot find any reason to forgive him in law or morality. Let us describe in detail the observation points of his facts in law and morality: We hope that Mr. Chen can think calmly and bear the consequences of the evil causes he has sown. At the same time, we hope that young people who are on the wrong path will wake up quickly. Don't be impulsive for a while, and act willfully, causing yourself to eat your own fruits; then you will not betray the original intention of our publishing this communication.</p>
<p>(I) Legal observation: When Mr. Chen had physical relations with Ms. Wang, Ms. Wang was only fifteen years old, while Mr. Chen was already twenty-four years old. Therefore, although it was because it came from the other party's consent, it did not constitute the "aggravated rape crime" of "rape of a woman under the age of sixteen"; but it did constitute the "quasi-rape crime" of "consensual intercourse with a woman under the age of sixteen", which should be sentenced to imprisonment of seven years or more according to law. Fortunately, this is a private prosecution crime; unless Ms. Wang or her mother reports it, the law can forgive and not ask. Now, assuming that the marriage contract is cancelled (although there is no formal engagement, but the verbal expression of each other's meaning is also considered a marriage contract by law), no matter how Ms. Wang's infidelity can be proven; even if there is real evidence, it can only constitute the condition for canceling the marriage contract, and in no way can it be used to remove the responsibility of adultery. Therefore, once the other party is angered because of the termination of the contract, they will naturally report it immediately; at that time, Mr. Chen will have to prepare for at least seven years of prison life. In case the other party commits suicide out of anger, it will be even worse. Because the law has long prepared such a clause, saying that "those who commit rape and cause the victim to commit suicide out of shame and anger shall be sentenced to imprisonment of fifteen years or more." Waiting for your visit!</p>
<p>(II) Moral observation: Whether Ms. Wang has another lover, we believe that we cannot arbitrarily conclude that she is unfaithful just because she often spends the night outside. Judging from the fact that Ms. Wang insists on marrying Mr. Chen, we feel that Mr. Wang is inevitably paranoid. In short, without real evidence, it cannot be said. Even if we take a step back and say that Ms. Wang does have this kind of behavior; then this is also Mr. Chen's own fault. "At the beginning of man, his nature is good", the reason for Ms. Wang's bad habits is still planted when Mr. Chen first destroyed her virginity!</p>
<p>We also know very well that love cannot accommodate more than one person at the same time, so the spouse's exclusive thinking about the other party is considered to be correct. But before marriage, the other party's virginity seems to be more lenient. It is only necessary that after marriage, there is no third party involved. It is inevitable to insist on marrying a virgin as a wife. Based on the above reasons, Mr. Chen seems to be able to marry Ms. Wang. If after marriage, it is found that she still has relationships with other lovers intermittently, it may not be impossible to file for divorce again.</p>

<p>(6) The conscience was eaten by a demon star</p>
<p>In the vast sea from the South China Sea to Shanghai, a large 5,000-ton merchant ship, fully loaded with passengers and foreign goods, broke through the deep blue sea water and moved forward at full speed. The ship's sharp bow cut through the plane of the sea. On both sides of the bow, two snow-white waves surged up, as if they were always attached to the ship's forward movement. There was also a large group of white seagulls, clustering around the large ship, following day and night, as if they were afraid that the passengers would be lonely on the long journey, and deliberately followed to be good companions at sea. The passengers trapped in the cabin, in this vast and boundless environment, felt more and more the insignificance of human life. If they left this ship, they would immediately become Robinson Crusoe, who would be 90% dead. When they looked at this group of seagulls, sometimes soaring in the sky and sometimes floating in the heart of the waves, they would all have the fantasy that "I am not as good as them."</p>
<p>At that time, it was dusk, the sun had already disappeared below the horizon, and the eastern sky was as dark as paint. Only where the sun had set was there still a piece of yellow light, reflected on the sea surface, which could also be transformed into several golden snakes, wriggling and dancing. The passengers watching the sunset on the deck also went down to the cabin one after another. Only on a rattan couch in the recessed area behind the driving bridge was there still a fashionable woman lying, with her beautiful hair blown into a messy fluff. A handsome young man was sitting on the armrest of the rattan chair. He used his body to block her face, afraid that the sea breeze would blow her badly. People on the ship saw them whispering to each other, very affectionately, and they all said that they were a newlywed couple, enjoying the happy life of a honeymoon trip. Who knew that they were actually close relatives, an uncle and sister-in-law!</p>
<p>With the conscience of heaven and earth, Xia Youzhong never dreamed that he would betray his conscience and invade his brother's lover. However, Ai Ruohua had been planning this for a long time. She had always taken care of Youzhong meticulously. Youzhong thought she was especially virtuous as a sister-in-law, and would never have any improper thoughts. Who knew that when she got on the ship, she completely showed her attitude. When Youzhong was very worried and discussing with her how to rescue Zhongnan, she said indifferently:</p>
<p>"This is his own fault, he can't live!"</p>
<p>Youzhong was surprised and said, "He is your husband, how can you say such a thing?"</p>
<p>Ruohua said lazily: "It doesn't matter if you have this kind of evil and savage husband or not! As long as you are not involved, I don't care about anyone else." After she finished speaking, she squinted at him with her pretty eyes, followed by a charming smile, full of charm, which scared Youzhong and he didn't dare to open his mouth for a long time. Her love fire was burning and could no longer be contained, so she completely told him her secret love for him. Youzhong said with a guilty conscience:</p>
<p>"It's not that I don't love you, I just don't dare to have such bad thoughts, because I am still young, and I will do some business in society in the future. If I fall in love with you, it will be a disreputable thing. If my brother knows, it will be terrible. Even if I hide it from him, if outsiders know, my personality will be swept away! How will I be able to stand in society in the future?"</p>
<p>Ruohua pointed at his forehead with her slender finger, and then smiled: "You are really a child, people can't help but say that you are a fool! In this era, as long as you have money, where can't you eat? The missionaries who preach Jesus's doctrines have the most personality, earning only twenty dollars a month! The profiteers who sell enemy goods, the warlords who kill and set fires, the hooligans who protect opium, the politicians who are two-faced, and the corrupt officials who scrape the ground for money, as well as all kinds of shameless things, they are all people with no personality, but they have money in their pockets and are welcomed everywhere, who dares to say half a sentence about them? Now it is a world where gold is omnipotent, if you lose your personality, as long as you have gold, you can buy it back. If you have no money, you cannot be a human being, and if you have no personality, you can still be a high official and make a fortune. Have you seen anyone who has been looked down upon because they have lost their personality? Besides, free love is a legitimate thing, how many of the first-class rich people and the first-class fashionable ladies have been married through three matchmakers and six certificates?"</p>
<p>Youzhong was rebutted by her, speechless, staring at her foolishly, without any expression. Ruohua held him down and asked:</p>
<p>"Little one, have you made up your mind?"</p>
