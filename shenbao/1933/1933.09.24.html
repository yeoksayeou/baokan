<h3 id="c13">論統制經濟 <a href="#c13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>近年以來。統制濟之呼聲。震盪整個世界。言解决資本主義之困厄者。言</p>
<p>打破世界經濟之恐慌者。類都以統制經濟爲其結論。歐美各國。今都已實際施行。甚且視爲一種嶄新之經濟革命與資本主義之新生。</p>
<p>誠然。歐戰而後。資本主義之經濟組織。已經過兩次之調整與改進。一次爲生產合理化運動。又一次即爲當前之統制經濟運動。然而此兩次運動。自其實質言之。對於資本主義。都不過爲一種醫治作用譬之病人。巳罹痼疾。則一切針炙藥劑。皆不過爲盡人事。若謂其遂足以起死回。生重建資本主義之基礎。挽回資本主義世界之繁榮。恐亦爲一種幻夢而巳。</p>
<p>何以言之。資本主義經濟之機搆。即建築於（利潤）之上。而利潤之獲得。則又以自由競爭爲手段。唯自由競爭。故生產皆爲無計劃無政府狀態。一方面社會之購買力。日益削弱。另一方面產品之存積。日益增多。洎夫生產合理化運動實施。而此種矛盾。愈益加深。於是而痛感生產過剩。進而市塲萎縮。物價狂落。股票跌價。失業激增。工業衰落。農業凋敝。而形成此震憾全世界之恐慌狂潮。以動摇資本主義經濟之金個體系。故資本主義經濟恐慌之唯一根源乃在於生產手段之私有性。一切生產之無政府狀態以及生產與購買力之分歧。種種病象。皆非致成經濟恐慌之病根。而目前流行之統制經濟運動。則仍不能跳出生產手段私有。丨即私有財產制之範疇。此種（不要革命之革命）即能實施。其結果亦不過加强龔斷資本之形成。加强競爭之規模與力量。加强（經濟的國家主義）之意味。使爭奪市塲。投　塲與原料塲之鬥爭。更趨於强力化。更加强第二次世界大戰之爆炸性。而並不能解除資本主義之根本矛盾。</p>
<p>在資本主義國家統制經濟之另一面。則有蘇聮之計劃經濟。蘇聯計劃經濟。與資本主義　制經濟。在字義上固極相似。但在其實質上則顯然有極大之區别。即蘇聯計劃經濟。澈底怍一切生產手段爲公有。否定企業自由。其計劃乃爲一種社會意識之表現。生產與分配之問。又爲自覺的有計　的調節。故乃能收獲五年計劃之成效耳。</p>
<p>我國今日實施統制經濟之聲。亦囂然塵上。宋財長週遊世界歸來。提倡於前。吳達銓穆藉初兩先生近復鼓吹於後。凡其所言。皆特具卓見。尤以穆氏指陳我國實施統制經濟後。所必然遭遇之障碍。見解更爲深遠。今日世界各國。旣多已返於經濟的國家主義之途。則我國如不能應時代之潮流。以統制經濟調整當前之紊亂狀態。斷不足以謀自存。故統制經濟之實施。誠有必要。不過吾人所欲認定者。即我國之統制經濟運動。旣不同於蘇聯共產主義國家之計劃經濟。亦不同於資本主義丨特别是法西斯運動普遍化之列强之統制經濟。蓋我國爲以三民主義建國之國家。故統制經濟之實。施要當以民生主義爲立塲以平均地權節制資本爲原則。以中山先生之實業計劃爲藍本。統制全部之經濟活動。以徐圖打破資本主義國家經濟之桎梏。而求得經濟上之絶對自主自立。以步上民生主義社會建設之坦途。</p>
<p>此種工作。至爲艱鉅。實有賴於集合全國之俊彦與專家。共同作縝密之探討與周詳之考慮。始有成功之希望耳。</p>

<p>吳市長訓話云、文局長全體警察長官兵士諸君、我们的國家如此之大、人民如此之多、我们要用什麽方法來維持國家和民族的生存、保衛人民和平生活的秩序呢、大概有兩種力量、一種是武力、一種是法律、武裝的力量、就是軍隊、和平的力量、就是法律、軍隊是拿來抵禦外侮、遇有外力來侵略脅迫我们的國家民族的時候、我们就以軍隊的力量來抵抗、所以軍人的天職、是抵禦外侮、但在承平之時、我们就要以法律的力量來維持國家和社會的秩序、法律是死的條文、其本身是不能行的、是全靠人力來執行他的、但是由那種人來執行法律呢、那就是我们當警察的責任、警察能否擔負此責、就須看警察的智識能力如何而爲斷、世界日益進步、社會和人事、也隨之而日益複雜、因此警察的責任、也日益繁重、警察的智識和能力、必須隨世界和社會而日益增進、才可以應付進步的世界和複雜的社會、我國今日尙在建設的過程當中、不論那一個國、在此過程中、一定要有很大的紊亂、此在中外古今的歷史上可得證明的、這種紊亂、是每一個國家由亂而治由弱而强必經的階段、我们如果要减少這種紊亂、則更需要警察、警察是一個分佈在社會中、而時時刻刻和人民接近的組織、警察如果智識充分、能力健全、他的最大效能、就是能將潛伏在社會最裹層的有害於社會國家人民的一切危險、盡力設法消除於事前、以法律來維持社會的和平秩序、保衛地方的安寗、反之倘使警察的組織不嚴密、智識不健全、能力太薄弱、一定不能具此最大的效能、我们看到今日全國警察、其中有不能夠孚政府和全國人民之期望的、皆因他们组織之不嚴密、智識能力之淺薄、他们的效能最大、僅能制止社會的違法犯罪行爲、甚至於有不能制止犯罪行動於旣發之後的、警察的最大效能、就在消滅一切危險於事前、不得已而求其次、就須於危險爆發之時、即刻能制止之、减少之、而母使其擴大、如果警禁的效能、僅僅做到制止於事後這一層、這種警察、就已經有等於無、不是國家社會人民所需要的警察、就如去年一二八上海戰事而論、那時有許多反動份子、有許多漢奸、想藉一二八戰時的機會和外力、希　　吳市長檢閱全市警察（啓昌攝）</p>
<p>圖奪取政權、顛覆政府、危害社會和國家、幸當時上海市的警察、能於事前破獲漢奸和反動的組織機闗而消滅之、不使其爲害地方、爲害國家、這終算達到了一點警察的最大效果、我们警察的經費餉項、都取於人民的捐稅、人民固有納捐完稅的義務、同時即有要求政府充分保護其生命財產之權利、我们警察的經費餉項、旣取之於民、我们就要時時刻刻來反省檢查我们各人每天所做的工作、是不是滿足人民的期望、如果我们發見我们每天所做的工作、還不能滿足人民的期望、而有缺憾的地方、我们總要盡力設法彌補我们的缺憾、使人民滿足、這才是你们當警察的應盡的天職、政府和人民所期望於吾们警察的、旣如此大而且急、我们當警察的、萬不要辜負了他们、有虧自己的天職、因爲警察與其他官吏不同、他是最親民之官、公佈於社會各處、天天與人民接近的、所以他如果能夠盡責、人民大家是衆目共睹、要是失職、也是衆目共睹、做好事必受人民的稱贊、做壞事必爲人民所批評、我曾做過縣長、辦過幾年警察、我相信所有一切官吏、他的工作、最能博得社會的注意和稱贊的、莫如警察和縣長、因爲警察的縣長、同是最親民之官、對於社會上的樣樣事情、都要直接應付、所有應付樣樣事情的智識能力、都要很充分很具備、故在服務時、也最能增進他们的智識能力、只要我们作警察的作縣長的、能夠盡忠職務、一定能增進不少智識和能力、將來也一定能担負得起更重大的責任、現在諸位都在當警官或警士、不但這是一個很榮耀的職位、並且也是一個很好的機會、給你们來表現你们的智識能力、同時也增進你们的智識和能力、我爲什麽說當警官或警士是很榮耀的呢、因爲我们警察的職務、是直接爲人民社會服務、謀他人之福利、這是我覺得很可榮耀而不可多得的、所以你们要自重你们自己的地位、提高你们的人格、拿你们的智識能力充分的表現出來、使社會人民都覺得有警察就可高枕無憂、如果不能做好事、你们也不要做壞事、這是最要緊的、當然是很希望作好事、有利於國家社會和人民、不但盡了你们的天職、也可以使人民亨受福利、我们所以每年要檢閱警察、就是想要檢閱警察的智識和能力、能不能執行他重大的任務、使社會知道警察的效能、是否年年有進步、這過去的一二年、是上海市有史以來最危險最紊亂的一個時期、而上海市警察、比較還能稱職、大致不錯、但我们還不能以此自滿、同時也不能說就可以滿足社會人民的期望、故此後我们應更加努力、保持上海市警察以往的榮譽、</p>

<p>— 廬</p>
<p>買航空劵希望頭奬，要發財須得頭奬，不着便罷，一着便是數十萬元；這是全靠着幸運，不須有什麽本領的，所以買了航空劵，人人都有得到頭奬的希望。</p>
<p>剿共聲中，懸有賞格，得到某某首級者賞洋若干萬元，首者，頭也，賞者，奬也，首級賞金，簡言之，也可喚做頭奬。這般的頭奬，要有大本領，才會有這大幸運，不是人人可以希望的。所以，同一　奬，民衆心理中只希望着得到奬洋數十萬元的頭奬，而不希望得到賞洋若干萬元的也是頭奬。</p>
<p>論到也是頭奬的價值，莫大如戰國時齊王的頭奬，莫小於明朝宰相楊嗣昌的頭奬。</p>
<p>戰國策上有這麽幾句話：（有能得齊王頭者，賜金千鎰，封萬户侯。）這是名利雙收的頭奬，當然比着航空劵的頭奬，來得利益豐富。但，這個頭奬，究竟是誰得去的，戰國策上没有把得主頭銜披露，也只是說說罷了。</p>
<p>明崇禎十二年，宰相楊嗣昌督師討賊，出有賞格：（斬張戲忠頭賞萬金。）張獻忠知道了，也出條賞格，把來挖苦嗣昌，内開：斬楊嗣昌頭者賞三錢。）這未免太開玩笑了。三錢上面，没有一個銀子，當然不是銀三錢，而是銅錢三文了。俗稱（三文錢買一條醃臭鮝一，難道一代宰相的頭顱，等於一條醃臭絭麽？便算這（三錢）是指銀三錢的，合着現代的銀幣，也只值大洋四角，這可以算爲頭奬麽？只好算一個小小的末尾罷了。</p>
<p>近來，聽說要懸賞購緝僞國丞相等，吾想他们的頭奬，大概也不過值四毛錢吧。横豎是辦不到的，開價太大了，反而增加他们的頭奬的價值，有什麽值得呢？</p>
<h3 id="c176">說龜 <a href="#c176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— 金孑</p>
<p>龜居逵切，古文作龜字。自古相沿，被舉爲甲虫之長，而且還和龍鳳麟三種東西聯在一起，同被目爲（四靈）之一。雖然龜的買相，確然不很漂亮，但是人们見了它，往往把牠當做一種很吉利的東西，而且大家都相信它是動物中壽命很長的一種，很少人會去傷害它，至少限度，也並不厭惡它。還記得小時候所看的幾部舊小說裹，往往有這麽幾句話：（此人腰圓膀闊，頸短頭尖，正合相書上的龜形，今後必當大貴。）還有唐朝的音樂名家李龜年先生，特地把龜字用做名字。可見龜這一樣東西，在以前委實是很受人推崇的。至今日本人的大名裹，也時常可以發現這個龜字，像（高橋龜太郎）之類。</p>
<p>不知道打什麽時候起，這個龜字的上面，突然給人加上了一個烏字，不提龜字便罷，一提龜字，總是高喊着：（烏龜）（烏龜，）有幾位最不客氣的人竟是開口（臭烏龜，）閉口（臭烏龜，）盡情的把龜字糟塌，甚至還用它來作爲那些）老婆偷漢，明知之而故縱之）的小丈夫们的代名詞。其實却是大大的不通。第一龜只有密司，或密昔司，並無密司脫，根本不能代表男性。（玉篇）上載得很分明：</p>
<p>（龜。文也。進也。外骨内肉。天性無雄，以爲雄也。）</p>
<p>所以，俗語也有（蛇盤烏龜）的一句話，這是極明顯的確證。而且（烏龜）這兩個字，根本並無出處，（臭烏龜）更無論矣！因爲，我们讀過（爾雅，）在（釋蟲）的一節裹，早見過這麽一段：</p>
<p>（十龜：一神龜，二靈龜，三攝龜，四寳龜，五文龜，六筮龜，七山龜，八澤龜，九水龜，十火龜。）</p>
<p>那裹又有什麽烏龜？</p>
<p>我對於世人的妄把這種靈物糟塌，認爲也是一椿莫大罪過，龜號和我並無何種交誼，但是事實却不能抺倒，因作說龜文，爲龜張目。</p>

<p>— （錢澐作文）（楝良作盡）</p>
<p>有甜心者可貴</p>
<p>誰個男性走在路上不看女人，可封爲聖人，誰個女性說出言語待到無人注目時：這位女性無疑地已上了年紀，嬌聲一呼，衆男唯命是從，一樣無疑地知道這個女性眞是了不得的青春嬌美當口！</p>
<p>有的一面恐懼，一面暗喜，恐懼一般男性在後甲乙丙的胡鬧，暗喜自己有誘人的美麗，這種女性逢到外出，就愛合伴同性：但有甜心者一反此例。伊可以把甜心作爲護士，同時並可驕傲於許多不三不四的男子之前。</p>
<p>我们在公園看見得最多，伊將一頂咤帽一根司的克，可以嚇退羣雄，這是一種不　聲明的標記，免了許多牽纒，不然常有男性裝作無意地傍坐到女性的那隻空位上去；所以有許多女性，不喜獨個走公園，爲了上海似乎用不正當手段交女朋友的太多了，但反過來說，如今時有一般女性，探知深奥，故意留着旁邊空座，引誘無知男性入　，自然這種女性存着顯明的背景；祇是公園空氣，難說新鮮了！</p>

<p>積之道：當一連長，掙錢也就不少罷，有道是發了餉，嗓在他拉　倉餉以後，你们的生意，一定要好一點。店伙道：你說當連長掙錢不少，那位趙連長，他還不願意幹呢。我記得今年上春，他和一個闗連長在這裹喝酒，打算娶媳婦。可是這個新娘子家裹，不愛軍人，這趙連長就急了。說是不幹連長了。那闗連長連說帶勸，駁了他一頓，說是熬到一個連長，很不容易，爲了娶媳婦，要把連長丢了，那很不合算。積之聽了這話，心裹頭未免受了一種極大的剌激，不醉呢，臉先紅了。便問道：你知道他說的是那家的姑娘嗎？店伙道：我也是這樣的想着爲了娶媳婦，要把差事辭掉想必這姑娘長的很是好看。所以也就留心聽了下去。聽來聽去，好像這個姑娘和趙連長倒是街坊。也就住在海甸街上呢。積之心房裹，連跳了兩下，便道：哦！還是街坊，不知道這婚事成了没有？店伙道：看那樣子，婚事好像是成了。後來趙連長到這兒來過兩趙，常是有朋友和他開玩笑，說他要娶太太了，可是差事也還在幹。我想天下没有那樣　的人，爲了媳婦，肯把差事丢了。積之道：那也不見得邑？爲了女人丢差事的，就多着哩。討不着媳婦，爲着氣把差事丢了，我路上就有那樣一個人，别說是還討得着呢。他說到這裹哈哈一笑，端起酒杯子來，就喝了一口酒。店伙也看不透他這作法，是什麽用意，趙連長他說他的媳婦，碍着你什麽事，倒要你起急呢？（一九五）</p>
<h3 id="c179">蘇俄之發掘皇陵 <a href="#c179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>蘇俄爲了振饑，發掘，彼得格勒諸皇陸　，首剖最近代亞力山大窮三之塜，次及亞力山大第一，則塜空中無所有；相傳亞力山大第三死於太干盤格，後葬彼得格勒，今乃證實亞皇生前，確是爲僧於西比利亞，終其天年。這類疑團，我國却也有之。相傳清世祖就是勘破紅塵，潛赴五台出家的，因爲清廷深諱其事，到現在仍是疑團。按世祖爲有清入闗第一個皇帝，即位時，年齡甚幼，太后當國，與世祖的叔父多爾袞有染，後竟正式下嫁，如民間之（叔接嫂；）那時世祖知識巳開，胸懷隠痛，而無可如何，還要正式下詔，恭請叔父入宫與太后同居，醜穢已極！更有納某妃不遂一事，尤爲灰心，所以有出家的傳說。前歳平津一帶，忽然盜墓之風大熾，明清兩代的大人物，如劉瑾多爾袞等墓，先後被盜，清陵亦竟不免，但世祖的陵寢，却未被盜。於是有人這樣想：假使世祖陵被掘，倒是個可遇而不可求的釋疑機會，只要陵内無屍，出家之說就算證實了。的確，這是可遇而不可求的，宵小未曾盜，如何可以公然掘騐呢？我還有一種感想：歷代大人物，死後無不豐殮，恰恰成了個漫歳誨盜，在易姓之後，大都不免於抛屍露骨，吕后且不免於在亂世被掘出淫屍，反不如平常的窮人，能永遠安然長眠。就像俄國</p>
<p>諸皇陵，如不是銀棺殮葬，及寳物殉葬，也就不致有　掘之舉了。其次，則外人辦事，的確有秩序，井然不紊，蘇俄發掘皇陵，竟也組織了個剖棺委員團，發掘之時，一依委員長發令行事，而我國却是宵小夜盜。這一點，雖不能兩相比擬，可是蘇俄之發掘，完全出於秘密，這回乃是蘇俄政治偵探洩露消息，被波蘭京城華沙某報刋載出來，纔傳播於世，也就不免與我國之掘，有點差不多了罷？一笑！</p>

<p>— 銀楓</p>
<p>傑格和倍莉是一對雙生子，面貌和身材完全相同的。在某一星期中他们將舉行一個慶祝他们六週歳生日的會，因此他们預備儲蓄些錢，買樣生日的禮物，互相贈送。現在傑格知道一個人名呌史密司先生他有一隻可愛的小狗出賣，這樣東西倍莉一定歡喜的。倍莉也知道這雙小狗的，他想買來送給傑格，是何等佳妙的一樣生日禮物啊</p>
<p>所以一天早晨，倍莉走到史密司先生的家裹，說道：</p>
<p>（史密司先生，你的小狗要買多少錢啊）？</p>
<p>（你要買小狗，好啊，史密司先生說，（很便宜的，只要你出五先令好了。）但是倍莉身邊只有四先令十一辨士，凑不足五先令，史密司便說：不要緊的，好在你的生日是星期五，我把小狗留着，不賣給别人，等到星期的晚上，你拿五先令來，便把小狗帶回去。）</p>
<p>不料到了星期三，傑格帶了五先令到史密司的家裹去買小狗，史密司先生不在家，史密司夫人走到門口一看，伊想他是倍莉無疑。伊便收受他的錢，把小狗交給他。倍莉在星期四眞的又到史密司先生的家裹去，史密司一看小狗不在，知道已經賣給别人了。</p>
<p>（我很抱歉），他說，（你要買一隻小兎子去吧？）所以倍莉便買一隻小兎子送給傑格。到了生日的早晨，這一對雙生子，剛從床上起身的時候，就向窗外望去。小朋友丨你想他们看見些什麽？我來告訴你。他们看見兩樣生日禮物，在草地上奔來奔去，顯出十分快活的樣子，眞是自有生命以來，從未見過這樣友好的。當然，倍莉看見這雙小狗，很是驚奇，至於傑格見了這隻小兎子，也是十分愛好。從前這一對雙生子有了東西，一定要平分，現在他们同意，這隻小狗和小兎應該歸兩人公用。從此以後，任何事他们都好好的做了。</p>
<p>（小朋友丨這篇故事中，先令）和（辨士）兩個名稱，應該說明的。這是英國的錢幣名，好像我國有（銀元）（角子）（鋼元）等錢幣名一樣。它们不是十這位的，十二辨士爲一先令，好像十二呎爲一时一樣。上海現在市上通用的角子也不是十進位的，一個銀元好兌十二個角子多咧。）</p>

<h3 id="c237">打聽印象 <a href="#c237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— 桃椎</p>
<p>五四運動以後，好像中國人就發生了一種新脾氣，是：倘有外國的名人或闊人新到，就喜歡打聽他對於中國的印象。</p>
<p>羅素到中國講學，急進的青年们開會歡讌，打聽印象。羅素道：（你们待我這麽好，就是要說壞話，也不好說了。）急進的青年憤憤然，以爲他滑頭。蕭伯納周遊過中國，上海的記者羣集訪問，又打聽印象。蕭道：（我有什麽意見，與你们都不相干。假如我是個武人，殺死個十萬條人命，你们才會尊重我的意見。）革命家和非革命家都憤憤然，以爲他刻薄。</p>
<p>這回是瑞典的卡爾親王到上海了，記者也發表了他的印象：（……足跡所經，均蒙當地官民殷勤招待，感激之餘，異常愉快。今次游覽艱感所得，對於貴國政府及國民，有極度良好之印象，而永遠不能磨滅者也。）這最穏妥，我想，是不至於招出什麽是非來的。</p>
<p>其實是羅蕭兩位，也還不算滑頭和刻薄的，假如有這麽一個外國人，遇見有人問他印象時，他先反問道：（你先生對於自己中國的印象怎麽樣？）那可眞是一篇難以下筆的文章。</p>
<p>我们是生長在中國的，倘有所感，自然不能算印象）；但意見也好；而意見又怎麽說呢？說我们像渾水裹的魚，活得胡裹胡塗，莫名其妙罷，不像意見。說中國好得很罷，恐怕也難。這就是愛國者所悲痛的所謂（失掉了國民的自信），然而實在也好像失掉了，向各人打聽印象，就恰如求籖問卜，自己　裹先自狐疑着了的緣故。</p>

<h3 id="c238">農民詩人 <a href="#c238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— 何如</p>
<p>無論舊詩人也好，新詩人也好，在現代的中國文壇還缺乏一種農民詩人，這是事實。農村經濟的破產，農民不能忍受的痛苦，經濟家政治家革命家都感覺到了，難道敏感的詩人倒没有感覺到麽？四川的田賦不知預徵到民國幾十年了，苛捐雜稅總有一百幾十種罷，可惜没有詳確的調查統計。申報二十日南昌專電，（經濟會調查贛東贛西贛北三十三縣田賦附加，達九十餘種名目。玉山每米一石，徵二十餘元。某週刋載，廣豐每畝徵至六十元，餘亦達正稅數倍，而區保甲臨時攤派，則隨時隨地誅求，無從調查。）又電，（撫河早穀每擔跌至一元八角，農民因保甲築路清剿各捐賦，雖欲忍饑賤賣，亦無人承買，農村成爲阿鼻地獄。）這阿鼻地獄豈僅限於江西一隅？整個中國那里有一片樂土？我们並不奢望有杜甫白居易那樣的大詩人，能夠有一點閒情，偶然寫幾首社會問題的詩，只要有于濆聶夷中一流不爲社會所重的小詩人，也就夠得我们文壇的誇耀了。</p>
<p>說到聶夷中，或許是大家很熟悉的罷。（鋤禾日當午，汗滴禾下土。誰知盤中餐，粒粒皆辛苦？）這首相傳爲李紳的憫農詩，一說聶夷中作，我们從小學敎科書中就讀過的。還有（二月賣新絲，五月糶新穀。醫得眼前瘡，剜却心頭肉。）這首題爲傷農家的詩，也是聶氏詩中最被傳誦之作。</p>
<p>至於于濆，在當時旣不甚有名，後來也不見有人稱道。其實說到唐代的農民詩人，他比聶夷中或者更爲道地些。可惜他们流傳下來的詩很少，全唐詩各錄一卷而已。于濆也和聶夷中一樣，沉於下僚，他们所以同情於無所控告的農民，那是不難說明的。于濆的山村曉思一詩：</p>
<p>開門省禾黍，隣翁水頭住。今朝南澗波，昨夜西川雨。牧童披短簑，腰笛期烟渚。不問水邊人，騎牛傍山去。他這種闗於田園的素描，比起陶淵明儲光義來，並不怎樣（推板）。但他描寫農民的痛苦，如說（壟上扶犂兒，手種腹長飢。窗下抛梭女，手織身無衣。）（辛苦吟）（古鑿巖居人，一廛稱有產。雖霑巾覆形，不及貴門犬。）這却不是陶謝王孟以至儲光義一流歌詠田園山水的詩人所肯污其高貴的詩筆的罷。</p>
<p>我们知道　朝有名的軍閥戰爭，史書稱爲藩鎭之禍，這種戰禍是落在農民頭上的，軍閥官僚却乘機升官發財討姨太太。可稱爲農民詩人的于濆，他就在古征戰一詩裹，揭開戰爭的内幕，不過是少數人爲了滿足其金錢和美人的慾望，兵士在這種戰爭中的所得：只是（赤肉痛金瘡，他人成衛霍）而已。至於他說（一曲古凉州，六親長血食。勸爾盡長眉，學歌飽親戚。）（織素謡）那些因裙帶闗係而飛黄騰達的也就夠受了丨</p>
<p>目前中國，没有不折不扣的民族英雄，你想做個民族詩人，苦於没有偉大的題材，幻設假託，騙人也不容易。倘有一個詩人，肯用他的高貴的詩筆，描寫低賤的農民，正有許多可歌可泣的題材供你選擇，農民是不會拒絶你的。難道聶夷中于濆那樣的詩人都没有麽？</p>
<h3 id="c239">没有丑脚的戲劇 <a href="#c239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>魏猛克中國的話劇我是極少看的，這原因大概是以前看過一些國產影片，得到的印象太壞，就不敢再去看話劇了。據說，舞台比銀幕是要更難。</p>
<p>然而後來也終於看了幾回話劇的，果然，得到的印象更不好。最使我失望的，是與所謂文明戲）並無多大差别，卽使演一齣大悲劇吧，也要無端添幾個丑脚，使劇情化爲滑稽，結果給看客们打個哈哈而散。自然，趣味是也頗有趣味的，但大世界的把戲，却比這更有趣。近日偶閱串報，忽在廣告欄裡，發現了一怒吼吧，中國！）的幾個剌目的大號字。這使我頗爲驚喜，只要稍稍闗心現代戲劇的人誰都知道，這是用新的意識，新的藝術組成的名劇。自然這機會是不可錯過的了。然而一查旁邊的小字，可又使我失望：原來並非電影，而是我不敢再看的中國人自己排演的話劇。</p>
<p>九月十六日的傍晚，閒步八仙橋，突被一位胸脯上掛着幹事字樣的徽章的友人，綁進黄金大戲院裡去了。也罷，雖然我並不熱心，但也不必像　子一樣的固執到不通世故。</p>
<p>這是公演的第一天，　衆却並不踴躍，但也不必奇怪的，一看名目，就可以了然，是没有什麽接吻和女人的大腿　　。中國人雖然　　禮敎之邦，但對於接吻和女人的大腿，却似乎比洋鬼子還要喜歡。</p>
<p>白的燈光暗下去，色的燈光亮起來。</p>
<p>商船，兵艦，十字架和絞台；胖頭胖腦的洋　辦，鳩形鵠商的勞工……在眼的出現了。</p>
<p>舞台上是壓迫者的勝利的歡呼，被壓迫者的痛苦的慘呌，舞台下却忽然由無意識的吵鬧而變成死的靜寂。</p>
<p>（怒吼吧，中國！）</p>
<p>這口號從舞台上傳開來，舞台下突地迅雷般暴發了一聲同樣的回響。觀衆们在這一聲迅雷下驚覺，像潮水樣湧出戲院了。</p>
<p>夜來的凉風，將我的緊張的情緒和緩下去，我感到我的心是滿足而充實。我看見每一個觀者的興奮的臉，使我更加歡欣。</p>
<p>固然，這樣有意義的話劇在目前還不能普遍到大衆中去，然而能夠感動一部分的觀衆　終竟是有意義的。戲劇恊社這次的公演在技巧上雖然缺點尙多，但旣有這感動的力，就證明成功之處也不少。而博得看客一笑的丑脚，在這次公演裡没有登塲，也就證明中國的話劇是在進步了。</p>

<p>（七）殺人食人</p>
<p>有人寫過一篇發揮民族精神的小說，呌做（國門之戰）。他的最得意處，也就是最發揮民族精神的地方，是殺人。自己吃得醉醺醺，舉起刀把人的腦殼劈開，讓一般白漿從頭頂上冒出：寫得眞是如　　活虎，令人心　。因爲　到這篇小　　　　　　）起　　海　　　一裹听　的一件事：</p>
<p>隋麻叔謀，朱粲，當蒸小　以爲　　唐高瓚蒸妾食之。嚴震，獨孤莊，皆嗜食人，然皆　醢而食也，未有生噉者。至梁羊道生，見故舊部被縛，拔刀刳其晴呑之。宋王彥升俘虜獲胡人，置酒宴飲，以手裂其耳，咀嚼久之，徐引巵酒。俘者流血被面，痛楚呌號，而彥升談笑自若。前後凡噉數百人，即虎狼不若也。</p>
<p>讀（國門之戰），可以呌你精神颤憟，讀此記，是會更令你伸舌難縮的。王彥升的這種精神，與劈腦蓋的英雄的豪舉，都是難能可貴。惜乎一九二七在乂乂，把女子衣服拉光，執行槍决，然後把萬花筒插在死者陰户裹燃放，以圖一快的人是誰，不得而知。不然，眞可以說是鼎足而三了。寫到這裹，又想起一邵氏聞見後錄）裹，有一條類似的記載；漢武帝用杜周爲廷尉詔獄，連逮至六七萬人。吏所增加，十有餘萬人。唐武后鞫流人，一日之中，萬國俊殺三百人，劉光業殺九百人，王德壽殺七百人。</p>
<p>殺人之事，在中國，眞是家常便飯，不分古今，都是一樣。尤足誇耀的，就是殺的不僅要多，還要殺得藝術，有各種各樣的姿式，各種各樣的方法。中國，誠可謂殺人的民族也哉。</p>

<h3 id="c269">驚人的消息公樸 <a href="#c269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>在日前一九一八）二周年的沉痛纪念那一天·各報於發刋各種方式的紀念文字外，同時並載有一個驚人的消息，即英國文學家，名著（世界史大綱）的著者威爾士Ｈ．Ｇ．Ｗell先生預言謂，亞洲遠東在十年内將有大變亂發生，而中國全境將受絶大的蹂躏，中國四百餘州，將入於極大的混亂局面之下……。</p>
<p>一般讀報者，對於這個消息的反響，據我们觀察，不外乎以下的二種心理：（一）平素對於國内外的現勢，從不加以注意的人们，他拉以爲這種預言，至多也不過同（算命瞎子）的話差不多，不可不全信，聽之，以觀後效可也。（二）對於國内外現狀素有相當認識的朋友们，他们以爲這個預言可同一般天文學者，或地質學家的十萬年或五萬年後太陽將有變化或是地球將要分裂的一類預言不同，因後者僅爲一　學術上研究的一種暫時的結論，而威爾士先生的這個預言，則完全是根據目前國際情勢，若是實際上不能改變方向，如此一天一天的惡化下去，那麽，這種推測自爲必然的結果，不待威爾士預言也已早有人說過了。所不同的，就是以前的人從没有如這一位文學家說得這樣斬釘截鐵，活靈活現的算出一九三五年怎麽樣，以及一九三六年到一九三八年又將如何，或者，這也就是普通推測與預言所不同之點罷！</p>
<p>我们看到今日各國拚命的整頓國防與擴張軍備的情形，回顧我们自己國内政治不統一，國民生產能力是一天衰弱似一天的景象，我们深信這個文學家的預言是很難僥倖而避免的，那麽我们還是坐以待斃呢，還是應當立刻從事準備，各盡一分能力智力，做一分奮鬭抵抗的工作呢？但是事實的情形又是怎樣呢？在上期（一周不如一周的二周紀念）漫談中，記者曾大概叙述過的，亦不必重說了。總而言之，政府當局，旣乏勵精圖治的表現，而民衆更是一盤散沙，充滿苟安自私的心理。有人說：（第二次世界大戰發生的日子，就是我们中華民族復興開始的時候！）這種抽象的不着邊際的理論，即使有其相當的根據，不過我们也應知道，一次世界的大混亂，一面雖有予被壓迫民族以復興的機會，但同時也有使一老大民族滅亡的危險！其闗鍵的所在，就是要看這個老大的民族，當此世界大戰行將爆發的前夜，有没有振作復興的準備。</p>
<p>新從美國回來的徐善祥先生，日前在國際問題研究會講美國復興計劃的演</p>
<p>辭中曾說：（美國人民，於時勢危急時，對於政府能授以權力，俾得便宜行事，能犠牲政治成見，一致擁護。此種精神，實爲共和國民所不可少，而我们中國人則完全無之，疆土雖已喪失五百萬方里，大敵雖巳臨前，而内部則仍天天打架，惟恐國家不亡。）最後，徐先生更大聲的警告國人說：（數年之内，中國必有一極大的不景氣，較之今日必增加十倍。去年輸入之洋貨價值，達八萬九千一百餘萬金單位，而輸出土貨之數量，祗值四萬一千九百餘萬金單位，入超約四萬七千一百九十萬金單位，合國幣八萬七千萬元，以四萬萬人計算，每人担負約二元二角。以中國目前情形而論，貧無立錐者居大多數，何能有此力量，每人拿出二元，送到外國呢？其勢非至全國國民破產不止！）那末，等到破產之後，受人宰割呢，還是急起圖存，準備反抗呢？則有待於我们的自决。</p>
<p>若想靠别人，希望别人帮忙，那全是妄想！</p>

<p>辛苦了一月，發薪水了，出於意料之外的，只拿到預定薪金的半數。正在懷疑，總經理召集我们訓話了，他對我们說道：</p>
<p>（今天諸位有些失望吧，這是我對諸位十分抱歉的。你们的薪水不是我個人定下來的，是會議上議决的。幾位主任以爲諸君都受過中等以上的敎育，一定是淡於利祿，且實際上諸位都很年輕，想來没有多大的負担。……上海地方，五方雜處，良莠不齊，年輕人血氣未定，手頭有餘，往往會走入邪路。……：所以，一方面也是爲諸位打算的。好在年終是要考勤的，諸位只要努力，加薪晋級是極容易的事，我决不會虧負諸位的！）</p>
<p>唉，（　於利祿一，（無多大負担），（手頭有餘，往往會走入邪路），恭聆之後，我们只得忍　退了出來。但是一想到他說：（年終考勤，只要努力，加薪晋級是極容易的，……）於是我们又充滿了希望，繼續努力下去了。</p>
<p>年終了，新年到了，一月份發薪了，大家都喜形於色去領各人自己的薪水，可是眞出於意料之外的，薪水依然老數目，分文未加！</p>
<p>我们忍無可忍，八個人同去見總經理。我们還没開口，總經理却先說道：（你们的來意我已知道，但是去年公司裹並没有赚多少錢，所以要請諸位暫時等待一下。因爲現在若果加了諸位薪水，别人怕要學樣的，牽動了大局，事情</p>

<p>有什麽話好說呢？總經理是决不會虧待我们的。</p>

<p>在商界服務的人，大概都有一種希望，就是辛辛苦苦的替人家做了幾年夥計之後，從縮衣節食中，積蓄幾許資本，將來自己可以重打天地，另創基業（至於這希望能否成事實，那自然是另一問題）。</p>
<p>那未，在這裹，闗於創辦新店時應有的準備，當爲大家所樂聞的吧！</p>
<p>創辦新店時的準備，普通的如尋店基，裝生財，進貨物，用夥計……等，這在稍有一點商業經騐的人，大概都能理會到；但是除了這些極普遍的準備外，還有幾點，極闗重要，而爲一般創辦事業者所不可不知的。爰擇要記述如下</p>
<p>（一）登記上海近年各業俱有同業公會的組織，這種組織，對於同業是有良好而且密切的闗係的。一爿商店，初創的時候，應該先向公會登記加入，於事業的進行必能得到不少的助力。其次，上海社會局有工商業登記的譽辦，在成立之前也應前去登記，以取得法律上的地位。</p>
<p>（二）保險登記手續完備了，在着手辦事的時候，應該預先將資本總額試爲分配臂如資本總額爲五千元，以一千元作爲（商譽）丨店基生財，裝修等，以三千元備貨，一千元作爲流動資金，那麽，這爿店除了現金之外，至少要值四千元。有了約數，然後再去找一家穏健可靠的保險公司，投保火險。因爲災患之來，非可逆料；預保火險，所費有限，而資產却已有了保障，不致白這旡忘之災了。</p>
<p>（三）外費各種應辦的手續，都巳完妥，，這時候尙有一件頗闗重要的事，應該注意：在上海各級社會中，有一種特殊階級，所謂（白相人）。這種人，是專在在敲剥騙詐之中找生活的。他们有組織，有（顔色）　自然，一爿新店的創辦開市，是事先應該設法聯絡他们，予以好感，免得在開市的時候，受他拉種種必不可免的狠毒的中傷。</p>

<h3 id="c275">應時文章從（九一八）紀念想到民族英雄 <a href="#c275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>彼湘女士自（九一八）事變發生以來，距今巳逾兩年，現在　然在當局的忍痛之下宣告結束，但人民生命財產的損失，乃爲我國空前所未有。東北四省的富源，固已全部入於日帝國主義之手；即上海戰時的損失，也是同樣的浩大。然而在當時狹隘的愛國主義與愛國運動的浸淫之下，却造成了幾位名震全球的所謂（民族英雄），這眞是使我们民族不勝其榮幸的一件事！</p>
<p>但，這些民族英雄在抗日運動中究竟盡了些什麽任務呢？這是值得我们研究的。</p>
<p>本來，經過了不抵抗之後，抵抗的爆發，乃是必然的結果，而且是必然地會從下級官兵中間發動的。可是，當雙方的接觸巳經開始的時候，他们的長官丨這些本不想抵抗的民族英雄丨却還在强迫他们鎭靜，要他们嚴守上峯的命令。直到後來戰事成了騎虎之勢，加以不抵抗者深遭民衆的怨恨，大都希望抵抗者挺身而出，於是這些民族英雄纔摇身一變，順勢來一個所謂抵抗，藉資利用這個機會，來造成個人的地位，同時也可以博得好評。結果，犧牲者是一些英勇的下級官兵，而坐享其成者却還是這些民族英雄。最使人不解的，莫過於有些民族英雄中途曾一度投降日帝國主義，有些民族英雄正在忙於（安内），且上海停戰恊定的簽訂，有些民族英雄也是其中的主要人物，而這些就是他们在抗日運動中所完成的最大的任務丨</p>
<p>在這抗日反帝的怒潮之中，民族英雄旣然顯示得這樣無能，而其行動又是處處使人懷疑的，那未，爲什麽仍有人在抱着偶像的崇拜，向這些民族英雄表示熱烈的歡迎，希望他们能夠大顯神通呢？但是，我们要知道，這不過是一部分落後的小市民陷於狹隘的民族意識的衝動罷了，而大多數的勞苦羣衆是决不會相信這些英雄的，因爲他们深知抗日反帝運動决非少數人所能擔負，更不是一二民族英雄可以實行。假使我们要知道民族英雄究竟能夠做些什麽，那就是他们同樣的在阻礙抗日反帝運動的進行。反之，只有受壓迫和剥削最深的勞苦羣衆自己才是抗日反帝運動的主力軍，也只有他们才能夠堅决的負擔起這個重大的任務，否則，中國是永遠不會從日帝國主義及其他一切帝國主義的壓迫與剥削之下解放出來的丨</p>

<p>輪船火艙在汽輪上的火艙裹。前面是熱烘烘的爐火，後面是黑灰撲鼻的煤炭堆，祗有侷促，悶熱，燻，炙：籠置着整個的火艙裹。熱，比初夏時的印度吹火風還要厲害十倍，眞的，在那兒是狗都不能活的，但是，我们就要生活在其間。誰願意？可是我们是爲了吃飯，不願意也得願意啊！</p>
<p>每人，管理三躉爐丨丨九個爐口，用長長的爐耙鐵，煤鏟·煤鈎，鏟着，掘着，挖着那烏黑的煤炭，一鏟，兩鏟送到那熱烘烘的火爐裹，一面清挖着那些煤屎而把它送到鹹田去……。是這樣的動作着，從一個爐口一直到第九個，周而復始，循環不絶。眞的，連一秒鐘都不能休息的，否則爐火慢了，（水汀）（汽）也輕了，（那摩温）的火腿一隻又要送到你的屁股上來了。</p>
<p>工作時間眞長啦！頭更四點鐘，二更又四點鐘，一日八個鐘頭呌做（當更），此外，還要做兩個鐘頭清煤炭屎的工作。啊！一日十個鐘頭生活在那悶熱的火艙裹。好在有一孔的活氣，就是從烟通頂側的帆布風筒吹來的一陣生風，還是我们燒火佬（生火伕）的活命劑哩。</p>
<p>我们是人？眞不像了，我们的整個身體給那煤屑和熱力整天的燴着，燴成比烏龜還要黑得好幾十倍，簡直與南菲洲的黑人一樣。</p>
<p>爲了呼吸着的都是火氣和煤屑，黑的塵灰，積日久長，因此每個燒火佬便都變成了吐血内傷（人们多稱肺癆病）鬼。同時，又爲了生活不安和那灼熱的火的焰氣創心的緣故，遂而發狂，神經錯亂，以致跳海，寄身於魚腹的，……也是常有的事，每年在八十多萬的海員中不知要發生多少次數呢！</p>
<p>工是要做，工資也要發的。燒火佬的工資普通爲廿五塊錢（走外洋航線的）和廿三塊錢（走沿海航線的），而内河船竟有少至十五塊錢或十二塊錢的。不管三七二十一，（涉　沙）在你下船做工的時候，是先要把你第一個月的工資全部扣尅去的，隨後每月再扣兩元至六七元此外如館佣，厘金，茶金，先生錢，後生錢，　債，納利息，電話費（館用）神誕費，送禮……等等一大堆的費用都是要從這廿幾塊錢工資内開銷的。至於父母妻兒渴望着你的赡養，唉！那祇得，祗得（不孝）及（不慈）而巳。</p>
<p>那末，在没法中，你要想設法找點（外塊），（販黄魚）（偷運搭客）嗎？不能，祗有（拿摩温）可以這樣的做。想走點偷漏闗稅嗎？那也不能，闗口緊，檢查得嚴密，從香港帶十斤鹽，或從上海運些銅板到廣東，也要遭嚴密的搜查或究辦。没法，（外塊）眞不是經濟出路啊！</p>

<p>湖南寳慶通訊</p>
<p>提起湖南乂乂纺織廠·一般湖南人差不多都知道的，因爲牠是乂乂規模最大的紡織廠。扡開始是商辦的，後來因經理和廠長尅扣工人的工資丨有一年多没有發足工人所應得的工資丨引起了工人的罷工，資方就趁這機會把廠停閉了。一直到六七年前，才由乂乂乂接辦，直屬於乂乂機闗。該廠現分兩部：一係紗廠，一係布廠。紗廠共分彈花，清花，和花，梳併，變條，粗紗，細紗，摇紗，打包，揀花等十餘部。布廠共分經紗，落紗，漿紗，緯紗，穿扣，織布，折布等八九部。廠屋是水門汀鐵筋築的，屋頂是鉛皮鋸齒式的。裹面的空氣，因爲棉花屑常是落雪般在飛舞着，所以做工的大多犯有慢性結核病。如果是初進廠的，那他一定會感到他的呼吸是被棉花屑所窒息着了。</p>
<p>廠裹工人現共有四千左右，其中女的佔八九百。男工以初中出身的爲最多，其他如高中的，甚至大學出身的都有。女工也大半都是初中出身的。廠裹也有個工會，但工人都不大信任牠，因爲每次當工人和資方發生衝突的時候，工會裹的人常常對工人說：現在是國難期間，勞資雙方應當恊力合作，增進生產；工人不可有非法的舉動，有什麽事，應靜候本會解决等等　於是每次的要求，就這樣的（靜候）下去了。這工會名義上也出了份壁報，但實際上那份壁報是由工人自己幹的，每三天出一張，内容大多是偏重於政治及工人生活方面，文藝作品也每期刋載的。</p>
<p>工人每天工作十小時　分日夜兩班。工資　高的是六角，最低的是四角五分。監工和工頭對付工人很是凶暴；對於童工，毒打更是家常便飯。工人在出貨方面如果做得不好，就要受到罰錢，打駡，或是記過；記過滿了三次，就要被開除。但如果女工向監工和工頭表示些親熱的態度，那就不大會受到這種種的不幸了。</p>
<p>工人在放工以後，有的到俱樂部去遊玩。在那裹，各種的娱樂品丨如象棋，樂器等丨和各種的運動器具丨如足球，籃球，乒乓球等丨都有。有的到宿舍中去自修。有的到廠方設立的工餘補習學校去念書。該校學生人數大概在一千左右，依工人程度的深淺而編成五級。分日夜兩班上課。每天各上兩個鐘點的課。學生自己組織了一個自治會，還編了張壁報，是每天出版的。另外，學校當局也出了份週報，是師生命編的。廠裹有工人宿舍，專備單身工人居位，男女是分位的，都不收宿費。吃飯有公共食堂，每人每月的伙食費大約在五元左右，男女也是分隔的。</p>
<p>據上所說，我们可以知道這廠裹工人的生活一般的也還不差，這一半是因爲内地生活程度較低，一半也因爲該廠工人目前已有相當的團結。在九一八事變發生以後，他们就顯示出自己的力量來。他们成立了抗日會，組織了宣傳隊，演講隊，募捐隊到四處去活動。也組織了劇社，出演抗日反帝的劇本。</p>

<p>六歳到九歳，慕沙里尼在初等小學念書的時候，就是一個不安分又極討厭的孩子。他最喜歡和别的孩子爭吵，打架，胡鬧簡直成了他每天的功課。所以他底頭皮常常被尖石子劃破，他底臉上常常有横七豎八的爪痕。這還不打緊，最惹人厭惡的要算是他那一雙小手，常常偷竊人家的東西。有一次，他偷了一個獵人（用以爲餌）的畫眉烏，被獵人發覺，緊緊追趕，他就一口氣爬越小山，奔過草地，泅過攔着他去路的小河，雖然情勢是這樣的危急，但他那手裹的畫眉却還是握着不放。至於他的偷竊人家的楊梅和葡萄，竟然是家常便飯，不可勝計的事情。</p>
<p>慕氏已經十二歳了，雖然他老先生還像以前一樣的整天頑皮，不喜歡讀書，但是他的父母却在躭心着他的失學的不幸快將到來。生活是這樣的堅苦，家裹最低限度的生活也有無法維持的趨勢。麥爾唐尼迫於無奈，只好用懇切而可憐的字句，拚成一封給福利省省長的信，要求允許發給她一點補助費，使她兒子不失失學。信上說：</p>
<p>（我記得你有一天光臨敝校，過承奬飾。你說長久服務的我，理應得到敎育部長的補助金；仁人之言，　你不要時過境遷罷丨本來我極不願意。輕易囉囌，但是今年本地的市况變得太壞，收成歉薄還不打緊，葡萄種子又霉壞了。我家處此情勢之下　眼見得我那十二歳的小孩子，在福利波波利皇家普通學校好好的讀着　將要繼續不下去了；據孩子的先生们說；</p>
<p>他是很有出息的。如果你能夠給我一點津貼，或者敎給我一種方法使兒子不致廢學，我是没齒不忘的！）</p>
<p>這些話在大人先生们聽來自然無異於東風過耳，不配因此而煩心的。所以結果在省長先生（相應不理）和（不准）的批語下，插在省長公署的擋案中，再也見不到光明了丨可是這種不幸的答覆並不使她灰心，她只有更加刻苦自勵地去訓勉他的兒子。</p>
<p>在無可奈何中，慕沙里尼的母親不得不逼迫她兒子去受宗敎敎育，决定送他到色爾桑敎會寄宿小學去讀書。這在麥爾唐尼只覺得是一種最好不過的辦法，原來她是一個篤信宗敎的女子；但在慕沙里尼的父親亞拉山都羅（Ａlessandro</p>
<p>）却十分反對；因爲這位先生是深慨乎社會上的一切不平等，遂成爲强有力的世界革命家。在他革命的眼光裹看起來，宗敎無異於麻醉劑，它是統治者馴服人民的工具，自然是非常反對的，他怎麽願意送他兒子去享受這種麻醉呢？然而到後來畢竟順從了他老婆的意志，這是顧然的，他没有方法可以使他兒子跳出宗敎敎育的圈子，丨丨除非是從此廢學。</p>
<p>在慕沙里尼入學之前的一星期中，他的品行比以前更壞了。他知道學校的寄宿生活無異於犯人的坐牢，索性趁着這尙未入獄的時候，頑他一個痛快。於是他在街上狂奔，在田野游蕩，在叢林和葡萄園裹跳來跳去，好像一匹不受覊勒的野馬。</p>
<p>入學的一切準備不久就緒了，這對於慕沙里尼彷彿是禍事臨頭。他一方面固然有些捨不得分離他親受的父母和三歳的妹妹愛德凡（Ｅdvige），七歳的弟弟亞拉多（Ａrnaldo）；一方面又不忍他那放在光潔的烏籠内，掛在小房間的窗子上的這隻寳貝的金絲雀。當他束裝就道的當兒，眼眶裹充滿了眼涙，慢騰騰地爬進騾車，還回過頭來叮嚀囑託他母親，好生看待這隻雀兒。</p>
<p>疲削的騾子拉了破舊的騾車在傾斜不平的泥路上得得前進，他底父親權充一下車夫。他心亂意煩地冗坐車中，思家的心潮正像車前飛燕一般起伏不定。晚上，車子到了范閘（Ｆacaga）色耳桑學校的門前，他们父子倆互相默默地爬下車來，敲了一陣門一位旣跛且老的牧師而兼校長的把他们迎接進去。在暗淡的燈光下，校長把手摸着小孩子的頭，笑瞇瞇說：（好一個活潑的孩子丨）終　。慕沙里尼的父親和校長接淪好了一切，就和他兒子接工吻，離開學校。</p>

<p>(Peiping) Military News: Fang Zhenbin is indeed inside Huairou City; his headquarters is set up in a certain salt shop. Ji, Tang, Liu, Zheng, etc., have not yet arrived. Those who have arrived in Huairou with Fang's troops are one battalion of the guard regiment, about 150-160 men; one division of cavalry, about 800 men; infantry claiming to be three brigades, about 1,200-1,300 men (plus a training regiment with less than two-thirds of its firearms, mostly handguns). The organization is based on a "three-three system," with each regiment having three battalions and each battalion having three companies. The guard battalion is stationed inside the city, the cavalry and training regiment are stationed in Qiaozicun, and the infantry is stationed in Diaoyutai and various villages in Shichang. Around Huairou City, both inside and outside, there are also about 600-700 plainclothes patrolmen. On the 21st, Fang held a military-civilian assembly inside Huairou City, distributing many leaflets on the spot, and also plastered announcements and slogans all over the streets of Huairou, with wording all defying the central government. After the military-civilian assembly on the 21st, Fang convened a military conference of officers of middle rank and above, with the following plans: the first step is to occupy Peiping, with Fang's troops moving south from Huairou, and Ji, Liu, Tang, Zheng, etc., moving south from the Nankou area; the second step is, if the attack on Peiping fails, they will transfer to eastern Luan and contact so-and-so, etc., to plan another major action. It was decided that after the troops of Tang, Liu, Ji, etc., arrive, the first step will begin, and at the same time, contact will be made with eastern Luan. On the 21st, two Japanese military vehicles came from Miyun, carrying 40-50 Japanese soldiers, three or four officers, and two machine guns, and dispersed outside the east gate of Huairou, making shooting postures, but without firing. Also, a Japanese military officer entered the city and went straight to Fang Zhenwu's headquarters, where he had a lengthy discussion with Fang, the content of which is unknown. (Special dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Peiping) After Fang's troops entered Huairou, the Japanese Kwantung Army, considering the area to be a demilitarized zone under the ceasefire agreement, sent a Japanese officer stationed in Miyun to Huairou on the 22nd to warn Fang, demanding that Fang's troops leave the area by the evening of the 26th of this month, otherwise the Japanese side would send troops to attack. Fang's response is still unknown. A telephone call from Gaoliying stated that this morning at 9:00 AM, Japanese aircraft dropped leaflets over Huairou, and Fang's officers and soldiers strictly prohibited merchants and civilians from picking them up. This morning, the streets were plastered with wall newspapers and slogans. The most noteworthy was the rumor that Ji's troops had entered Dashilue and were about to flee near Miyun. People inside the city are very frightened. The number of Japanese troops in Miyun County has increased, and long-distance buses between Huairou and Miyun have been suspended. (Telegram on the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Military News: According to a telephone report from Magistrate Su of Shunyi County, at about 1:00 PM on the 23rd, more than 30 cavalrymen from Fang's troops suddenly came from Huairou to Niulanshan, which belongs to the county, to set up camp. They rested and drank water at the local autonomous region office, claiming that the main force would arrive later, and sought civilian housing in Banbijie and Sijicun south of Niulanshan as billets, and then returned to Huairou. However, as of now, their main force has not yet arrived. (Special dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Since Fang Zhenwu's troops sneaked into Huairou, our side has, in accordance with the spirit of the Tanggu Ceasefire Agreement, urged the Japanese side to pay attention. Japanese military officer Shibayama yesterday verbally conveyed the Kwantung Army's opinion to our authorities, stating that the Japanese side is willing to automatically warn Fang and order him to leave the area within a limited time, otherwise the Japanese side will send troops to pursue and attack unilaterally, meaning they refuse our side's dispatch of troops to suppress. Their excuse is that the Japanese army has advanced weapons such as airplanes and tanks, which can resolve the matter more quickly. Our side rejected the Japanese side's opinion based on three reasons, and still insisted that our side send troops to Huairou to suppress them unilaterally, because when the ceasefire agreement was established, the Chinese and Japanese sides agreed that, when necessary, our side could send troops to the war zone to suppress bandits with the understanding of the Japanese side. Our side's proposal is not without basis. Shibayama has forwarded our side's opinion to the Kwantung Army for instructions. The three reasons put forward by our side are: (1) If the Japanese army wants to quickly suppress Fang's troops, it must use aircraft, etc., for bombing, which will implicate innocent civilians and be contrary to humanitarianism; (2) If the Japanese army, which was withdrawn after lengthy negotiations, re-enters the war zone, not only will the previous achievements of the negotiations be wasted, but the world will inevitably become suspicious of the Japanese army again, and it will affect the Sino-Japanese relations that have gradually improved, increasing the difficulties for both China and Japan; (3) Fang's troops are weak and will not dare to flee south lightly. If they have to flee south, the Japanese army's pursuit will inevitably make the entire war zone devastated. If our army advances to suppress them, these three inconveniences can be avoided. (Special dispatch on the 23rd) (Peiping) On the 22nd, about 2,000 more people from Fang's troops sneaked into Huairou via Dashuiluekou. A dozen villages west of the Fenzhuang in Dashuyukou were occupied by the newly arrived troops. Xu, the captain of the 6th Squadron of the security team that previously monitored Fang's troops, and his deputy, Tong, both disguised themselves and fled the county town on the 22nd, and have safely arrived in Gaoliying. About twenty more team soldiers have also fled. Up to now, Fang's troops are still building trenches and defenses in the Qiaozicun area on the border of Huairou, and have not been seen to move.

<p>(Peiping) Military News: According to a telephone report from Magistrate Su of Shunyi County, at 10:00 AM this morning, a Japanese aircraft flew from north to south and then flew back towards Huairou. Fang himself is indeed stationed in the salt shop in the city. Fang also plastered announcements all over the streets of Huairou, the wording of which is roughly to secure the local area and resist the central government. (Special dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Regarding the resolution of the Fang-Ji issue, our side is still continuing to consult with Shibayama. At the same time, our authorities will also advise Fang to awaken, hand over his troops, and voluntarily step down to avoid prolonging and expanding the diplomatic issue. Tang's troops have more than 20 heavy artillery pieces, which are difficult to transport via mountain roads. Although his troops are moving in eastern Chahar, it is feared that they will be difficult to enter Hebei. Liu Guitang is wavering, and the Japanese puppet regime no longer trusts him.

<p>Japanese Aircraft Fly Over Peiping as a Show of Force</p>
<p>Circling Three Times in the Air and Flying Extremely Low, Distributing Leaflets Warning Fang Zhenwu's Troops</p>
<p>(Peiping) At 10:10 AM this morning, a Japanese aircraft with tail number 1651 flew over the city, circling three times and distributing a leaflet warning Fang Zhenwu's troops and the troops allied with them. The flight altitude was extremely low, and then it flew north. Since Japanese aircraft stopped coming here on June 25th of this year, three months have passed. Now, because Fang's troops are disturbing Huairou, they have come again to demonstrate their power. At the same time, the warning was not distributed in Huairou but in the skies over Peiping, and its intention is quite unfathomable. The original text of the leaflet stated: "In May of the 8th year of Showa, the Kwantung Army and the Peiping Branch of the Kuomintang Military Affairs Commission negotiated a ceasefire. At that time, both sides agreed and signed that Chinese troops could no longer advance to the area north of the line connecting Yanqing, Changping, Gaoliying, Shunyi, Tongzhou, Xianghe, Baodi, Lintingzhen, Ninghe, and Sutai. However, the united army currently commanded by Fang Zhenwu is operating in the area north of that line. No matter what the reason, the Kwantung Army absolutely cannot tolerate this action. Army Commander Fang must immediately begin to withdraw to the area south of the agreed line and completely withdraw by the evening of September 26th, leaving no soldier stationed there after the 27th. This is strictly demanded." (Peiping) A certain dignitary told reporters that Tang, Liu, Ji, etc., have reportedly not joined Fang's actions, because Fang's paper tiger has long been exposed, and Tang, etc., will certainly not want to support Fang as their leader. It is indeed strange that Fang's troops were able to sneak through the border of Jehol and arrive in the demilitarized zone. However, the Japanese side actively expressed to our authorities yesterday that Fang, Ji, and other troops are all communist, and the Japanese side will definitely drive them out of the war zone and will never side with them. If this is the case, then Fang's troops in Huairou only have Wang Zhongfu's two thousand men, with no more than six or seven hundred guns. Their strength is actually very weak. After our side obtains the understanding of the Japanese side, it will not be difficult to eliminate them by sending troops to suppress them. There will be no major impact on the overall situation in North China. In order to settle the matter and appease the people, the authorities still leave some room for Fang, unwilling to publicize his past secret acts, hoping that he will reform himself. As for the small bandits of Lao Haozi who have sneaked into Sanhe County, there seems to be no connection with Fang, but since the two sides are now only a hundred miles apart, collusion is possible. (Telegram on the 23rd) (Peiping) According to reliable sources, He Yingqin has asked Japanese military officer Shibayama to ask the Kwantung Army to seriously consider allowing China to send a special police team to deal with Fang Zhenwu, saying that Fang's troops have less than two thousand men and are not difficult to deal with. Shibayama has telegraphed Changchun for instructions. (Reuters telegram on the 23rd)</p>

<p>(Peiping) This morning, a Japanese military aircraft equipped with machine guns flew over the sky here. Residents have not seen Japanese aircraft for several months, and they could not help but feel alarmed when they suddenly saw it again. The aircraft flew quite low, circling the city and Dongjiaominxiang, scattering leaflets. The leaflets stated that the troops of Fang Zhenwu, etc., are now stationed in the area stipulated by the Tanggu Agreement as not to be defended by troops, and the Kwantung Army cannot tolerate this. They are now giving Fang Zhenwu a deadline to lead his troops to retreat south of the ceasefire line before the night of September 26. If he does not comply with the request, the Kwantung Army will attack him. The aircraft appeared in the sky shortly after ten o'clock and soared for half an hour before flying away. Chinese officials and others mostly expressed indignation at this kind of threat from the Japanese. (Reuters telegram on the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Peiping) An eight-person reconnaissance plane of the Kwantung Army flew from a certain base this morning. First, it monitored the actions of Fang Zhenwu's troops over Huairou and Shunyi, and then arrived in Peiping at 10:00 AM, dropping a communications tube at the Japanese army training ground. It then circled the city horizontally and vertically, scattering many leaflets only 100 meters above the ground. The leaflets were printed with the words "(Warning to Fang Zhenwu's troops and the Allied Army)," and the content demanded that the two armies completely withdraw from the ceasefire agreement area by the evening of the 26th, and stated that if they had not withdrawn by the 27th, they would be decisively attacked. The aircraft flew towards the base area after about half an hour.

According to reports obtained by officials here, there are a total of six or seven large and small bandit groups in eastern Luan.

<p>(Hankou) Chiang believes that the communist bandits have been harassing the country for several years, and the reason why they have not been completely eliminated is mostly due to the ineffective implementation of the Ba ​​Jia and Tuan Fang by local authorities. Therefore, during his spare time, he pored over the classics, and all the famous sages of previous dynasties who suppressed bandits and resisted the enemy that could be practically used now were recorded into a volume, compiled into a book called "Good Strategies for Resisting the Enemy in Previous Dynasties", and ordered all the bandit suppression generals to study it to assist in the suppression of the communists. The book was distributed to Hubei on the 23rd and is divided into (1) General Theory, (2) Ba ​​Jia, (3) Tuan Lian (with Rewards and Punishments for Service), (4) (Zhouzhai) (Shuipeng) (Defensive Equipment), (5) (Accumulating Grain) (Expenses) and other chapters. At the beginning of the book, there is a preface written by Chiang himself, saying that the vagrant bandits are erratic and uncertain, coercing the people, burning, looting, and killing, turning cities and villages into ruins. With powerful officers and soldiers, year after year, they cannot be subdued, but are turned around to be trapped by them. It is not only the communist bandits of today that are like this, it is not surprising, and there is nothing to be surprised about. Reading old books, in addition to the special records of Zeng and Hu suppressing the Nian, there are still many others who suffered from vagrant bandits, planned strategies, and countermeasures that can be used as models for us today and recorded in the classics. I have selected those that are useful and excerpted them for reference. (Central News Agency telegram on the 23rd)</p>

Now, the Zhonghua Book Company also wants to join, but I am afraid that the originally planned output is limited, so it is still being considered whether to expand the organization and capital so that those who want to join will not be turned away, but there is no concrete decision at this time. As for the official capital of 3 million yuan, this ministry has submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to allocate 7 million yuan in American cotton and wheat loans to establish an ammonium sulfate plant.

<p>His Dying Condition Was Extremely Miserable</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to his old subordinate Zhong Xiunan, Chen Jiongming's dying condition was that Chen fell into a coma on the night of the 19th, and the situation was very critical. He was immediately moved from the hospital back to his private residence at No. 25 Yuxiu Street, Happy Valley. At 12:00 PM on the night of the 21st, Chen suddenly woke up from his sleep and made a gesture to speak to us (Zhong referring to himself). We knew that he had reached his dying moments, so we had his daughter, Biyao, ask him about family matters. Chen smiled bitterly and said, "There is nothing to tell about my family matters, but the regret in my heart (referring to the rebel party matter) will never end." He waved his hand and gestured, asking for paper and pen, but his hand was stiff and could not hold the pen. His condition was extremely miserable, and we all wept. Then, he opened his mouth to speak, but could not form words, and then closed his eyes and died. Chen was fifty-seven years old. He had an eighty-year-old mother and his wife, Ms. Huang, living together in Hong Kong. He had three sons and five daughters. The eldest son, Dingxia, is seventeen years old and is studying at Datong High School in Shanghai. The second son, Dingyan, is twelve years old, and the third son, Dingbing, is only eight years old, both studying at Lingnan Branch School in Hong Kong. The eldest daughter, Baoyao, the third daughter, Ruiyao, and the fourth daughter, Shuyao, are all married. The second daughter, Biyao, is unmarried, and the fifth daughter, Meiyao, is studying at the Italian Infant Hall in Hong Kong. Her mother was almost devastated by Chen's death, and the young children also cried sadly. It is now decided to place him in a coffin on the 23rd and hold the funeral on the 30th. Chen's old subordinate Ma Yuhang wrote a brief history of Chen and sent it to various newspapers, praising Chen's past revolutionary achievements, but omitting the fact that he openly rebelled against the party on June 15, 1922, sending Hong Zhaoling's division to besiege the Presidential Palace and bombard Guanyin Mountain, but said that Chen also regretted his past behavior, although he did not express it in words, but privately regarded it as a regret for all ages. Ma also said that Chen extensively read books in his later years, and his political ideology changed greatly. In addition to writing the book "A Humble Opinion on China's Unification", he was recently compiling (Controlled Production), the content of which is to advocate the construction of a socialist country. He passed away before it was completed, which is very sad. Chen was placed in a coffin in his private residence on the afternoon of the 23rd, and few relatives and friends mourned. Only Ma, Zhong, and a few others and his family members took care of the funeral. Chen's lifelong friends such as Lin Yishun and Huang Qiang, the current chief of staff of the 19th Route Army, did not send condolences. Most of the newspapers in Hong Kong also degraded him, saying that Chen, who once dominated the two Guangdong provinces, was once in a position to be invincible, but now he cannot avoid dying in a foreign land. There is nothing left other than his body, and his whole family is old and weak and has no support. The situation is very pitiful, which was not what he had expected at the beginning. If he knows anything under the ground, he should be unable to rest in peace. Chen was placed in a coffin at his private residence at noon on the 23rd, wearing a blue robe and black mandarin jacket. The coffin of his mother, which was previously purchased and gifted by Ma and others, was borrowed. In addition to Ma and Zhong, only Huang Jusu and a few others offered condolences. The funeral is scheduled to be held on the 30th and buried in the Hong Kong Chinese Permanent Cemetery. Also, Ma Yuhang and others sent telegrams to his relatives and friends in Tianjin, Xiamen, and the Zhigongtangs in Jinshan and Kuala Lumpur. However, as of the evening of the 23rd, only one condolence telegram from Sun Chuanfang had been received. (Central News Agency telegram on the 23rd)</p>

<h3 id="e13">On Planned Economy <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>In recent years, the call for a planned economy has resonated throughout the world. Those who speak of resolving the predicaments of capitalism and those who speak of breaking the global economic panic all conclude with a planned economy. European and American countries are now practically implementing it and even regard it as a new economic revolution and the rebirth of capitalism.</p>
<p>Indeed, after the European war, the economic organization of capitalism has undergone two adjustments and improvements. One was the movement for rationalization of production, and the other is the current planned economy movement. However, in essence, these two movements are merely treatments for capitalism. Like a patient suffering from a chronic illness, all acupuncture and medicine are just attempts to do what is humanly possible. To say that they are enough to bring back the dead, rebuild the foundation of capitalism, and restore the prosperity of the capitalist world is just a dream.</p>
<p>Why do I say this? The structure of the capitalist economy is built upon (profit), and the acquisition of profit relies on free competition as a means. Because of free competition, production is unplanned and anarchic. On the one hand, society's purchasing power is weakening daily; on the other hand, the accumulation of products is increasing daily. With the implementation of the production rationalization movement, this contradiction has deepened. As a result, there is a painful sense of overproduction, leading to market shrinkage, plummeting prices, falling stock values, increased unemployment, industrial decline, and agricultural depression, forming a panic that has shaken the world and shaken the gold standard system of the capitalist economy. Therefore, the only root cause of the capitalist economic panic lies in the private ownership of the means of production, the anarchic state of all production, and the discrepancy between production and purchasing power. All the symptoms are not the root of the economic panic. The current popular planned economy movement still cannot escape the scope of the private ownership of the means of production, that is, the private property system. Even if this kind of "revolution without revolution" can be implemented, the result will only strengthen the formation of monopoly capital, strengthen the scale and power of competition, and strengthen the meaning of (economic nationalism), making the struggle for markets, investment venues, and raw material sources more intensified, further strengthening the explosive nature of the Second World War, and it cannot resolve the fundamental contradictions of capitalism.</p>
<p>On the other side of the planned economy in capitalist countries is the planned economy of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's planned economy and the capitalist planned economy are very similar in definition, but in essence, there is a significant difference. That is, the Soviet Union's planned economy thoroughly makes all means of production public and negates the freedom of enterprise. Its plan is an expression of social consciousness. The relationship between production and distribution is consciously and planfully adjusted. Therefore, it can reap the benefits of the five-year plan.</p>
<p>Today, the call for implementing a planned economy in our country is also loud. Minister of Finance Song advocated it after traveling the world. Mr. Wu Daquan and Mr. Mu Ji Chu have recently promoted it. All their words are particularly insightful, especially Mu's pointing out the obstacles that our country will inevitably encounter after implementing a planned economy, and his insights are even more profound. Today, many countries in the world have returned to the path of economic nationalism. If our country cannot respond to the trend of the times and adjust the current chaotic state with a planned economy, it will not be enough to seek self-preservation. Therefore, the implementation of a planned economy is indeed necessary. However, what we want to recognize is that our country's planned economy movement is different from the planned economy of the Soviet Union's communist country and also different from the planned economy of the capitalist, especially the major powers where the fascist movement is universalized. Because our country is a country built on the Three Principles of the People, the implementation of the planned economy should take the Principle of People's Livelihood as its standpoint and the equalization of land rights and the regulation of capital as its principles, taking Mr. Sun Yat-sen's industrial plan as a blueprint, regulating all economic activities, and gradually breaking the shackles of the capitalist countries' economy and seeking absolute economic autonomy and independence to step onto the path of building a society based on the Principle of People's Livelihood.</p>
<p>This work is extremely arduous. It really depends on gathering the talents and experts of the whole country to conduct thorough explorations and careful considerations before there is hope of success.</p>
<h3 id="e14">Citizens of Northern Jiangsu Telegraph to Request Relief for the Grand Canal Flood <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>(   ) Citizens of twenty-five counties in Northern Jiangsu Province stated that the middle section of the Grand Canal is the general hub for the concentrated discharge of floodwaters from the four provinces of Shandong, Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu. The river water and land area of 250,000 square miles, the water flowing down from which is nearly 20,000 cubic meters per second. Now, Shandong wants to manage the southern Grand Canal to allow the waters of the Wen and Si rivers to flow smoothly southward, and adding the Yi and Mu rivers, the capacity of the middle section of the Grand Canal will be difficult to bear. The Liu Sai River mouth is the way to discharge water into the sea, but it has not been dredged for a long time and it is difficult to discharge this large amount of water. Not only that, the Huai River Guidance Committee has opened the Zhangfu River, and also allows the water of the Hongze River to flow smoothly downward, but the way to the sea from the old Yellow River is still blocked, the water flowing down from the lower Yangtze River is still滞留, and the downstream of each dam returning to the sea is still blocked. Treating the water without first treating the downstream and treating the upstream first is to order the downstream of the Grand Canal to not increase the way to discharge water, but the upstream suddenly increases the source of water by dozens or hundreds of times. It is called Guiding the Huai River to the Sea, but in reality, it is Guiding the Huai River to the Grand Canal. The body of the Grand Canal north of Huai'an is extremely narrow, and now it suddenly receives such a huge current, then the breach in the Gaoyou Shaobo area in twenty years will definitely reappear in the question of Huaiyin and Huai'an. Therefore, the dangerous situation of the Grand Canal this year is unprecedented. On July 28, the water stored in the Zheng Gate of Qingjiangpu reached two zhang and two chi and four cun, and its height has exceeded the highest time last year by three chi and zero. The people wept and said that if a great disaster was approaching, they would be in danger of being unable to end the day. Therefore, they specially requested the central government to find a way to provide relief as soon as possible. The national government has ordered the Executive Yuan to order the Jiangsu Provincial Government to investigate the situation in detail and report back so that it can raise funds to疏复.

<p>The Paris Talks Come to an End</p>
<h3 id="e17">Britain, France, and the United States Achieve Solid Progress in Adjusting Views; Italy Also Has No Objections; Arms Supervision Will Be Trialed for Four Years <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) As a result of the talks among the British, French, and American disarmament representatives, France and Britain have tentatively agreed to support the US President's new four-year trial method for supervising armaments. The idea of ​​supervising armaments was originally proposed by Britain, and France developed it into a detailed plan, advocating the organization of an impartial international committee to implement supervision. Each committee member would be able to go to the signatory countries to inspect armed forces and munitions factories. This agreement was intended to last for ten years. The French representative stated at the last Disarmament Conference that France could not join any disarmament agreement that did not include provisions for supervising armaments, which shows the French side's firm attitude. However, the US President believes that the ten-year period is too long, advocating for a shorter period so that if the countries concerned find it unsatisfactory, it can be modified from time to time. Therefore, there is a proposal for a four-year trial. As for the detailed methods, the US President has not yet announced them. It is expected that the US representative Davis will announce them in detail after the Disarmament Conference reopens on October 16. As for Italy, although it did not participate in the talks here, it is heard that the Italian representative has received instructions to approve this plan. (22nd National Telegram)</p>

<p>(Paris) The German Ambassador to Paris visited British Ambassador Duler this morning. Although political circles are silent about the German ambassador's visit, it is expected that the ambassador personally conveyed Germany's answer regarding disarmament to Ambassador Duler. According to the Paris Echo, Germany is willing to accept supervision, but it must be allowed to build defensive works on the western border like those built by France, and it must be allowed to place heavy artillery. Bombing aircraft should be discarded, but chase aircraft should be retained, and Germany should be allowed to place them. Furthermore, international management should be conducted after the signing of each treaty. (Reuter's dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e19">Many Thorns Ahead <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) Britain and France continued talks today on the disarmament convention, first at a banquet at the British Embassy and then at the French Foreign Ministry. The British representatives were Foreign Secretary Simon, Under-Secretary Eden, and Head of the League of Nations Diplomatic Division, who has recently been appointed as Minister to China, Kedu Gan. The French representatives were President Daladier, Foreign Minister Pangou, and Massigli. British Privy Council President Baldwin was also present at the British Embassy banquet but did not join the discussions after the banquet. The most difficult problem that needs to be resolved urgently is the length of the trial period. MacDonald's plan only stipulates that offensive armaments should be destroyed within nine months from the date of implementation of the treaty. It is heard that the British government is unwilling to accept the French theory of fixed-term and automatic management, but if it is revised and France supports the British draft of March 16, then Britain may also accept the French proposal. The discussion at the French Foreign Ministry lasted for one and a half hours and invited Davis, the US representative to the Disarmament Conference, to the ministry to listen to the progress made in the British-French talks. As for how things are progressing, British and French cabinet members are unwilling to reveal it to the press. Only the communique stated that the purpose of the exchange of views between the two sides was to reach an understanding so that all debates at the Disarmament Conference, which will reopen next month, could proceed smoothly, and that the two sides had made solid progress in this regard. Simon is scheduled to go to Geneva tonight, and Davis and Pangou are scheduled to go tomorrow. The French cabinet will also hold a meeting tomorrow. According to reliable sources, in today's discussion, Britain, France, and Italy have reached solid progress in adjusting their views on this matter. It is heard that the general opinion is that the disarmament convention should be divided into two stages: (1) three or four years (a static period), during which Germany will replace long-term service troops with short-term service troops; (2) a real disarmament stage, implemented in three or four years. Although the principle of supervision has been generally recognized, the three countries still have different opinions on the method of implementation. Britain believes that reporting the number of armaments is more important than just discussing any supervision of armaments that does not specify the number. However, if the convention can be finalized, the amount of armaments that France is prepared to give up will also be deeply reassuring to Britain. As for the current naval treaty, it will not be changed before it expires. Although things have made good progress, there are still many thorns ahead, and it is not yet possible to be overly optimistic. (23rd Reuter's dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e20">Report to Respective Governments <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) Today, representatives from Britain, France, and the United States met. According to the communique, the talks today have yielded important results. These talks will be temporarily suspended so that each representative can report the progress of the talks to their respective governments. How to handle the discussion of each issue will be decided by each government. The French side will hold a cabinet meeting at the Rambouillet Palace tomorrow. It is probably necessary to wait for Britain and the United States to express their approval of the measures decided today before the French side can express a definite opinion. In addition to waiting for the approval of their respective governments, the opinions of all parties were very close at today's meeting. The French point of view has been generally approved by the British representatives. As for the contact with the Italian government, it is handled by the embassy in Rome. According to official telegrams, Italy's opinions are also close to those of Britain and France. Now, only the approval of the United States is awaited. Davis said that he has agreed to the opinions of Britain and France, but he is waiting for the approval of the White House. This meeting was a useful preparation for the reopening of the Disarmament Conference. The Italian representative to the Disarmament Conference, Aleazzi, will hold negotiations with Germany. This is undoubtedly the most difficult step before concluding a disarmament convention. However, since the major countries have reached an agreement, it is not difficult to take a common front against Germany. (22nd Havas dispatch)</p>

<p>(Paris) At 7:00 PM today, after the conclusion of the talks between the representatives of Britain, the United States, and France on the Disarmament Conference, the Foreign Ministry issued a communique stating, "As a result of repeated talks, the viewpoints of the three governments have become clearer. Last time, the US representative Davis, the British representative Eden, and the representatives of the French government gave a general explanation of the opinions of their respective governments.

<p>(London) The well-known political writer Major General Morgan revealed a letter in The Times today, explaining the difficulty of supervising armaments, saying that the British plan to manage armaments by implementing it with a delegation of commissioners dispatched by the League of Nations is actually difficult to implement. Those who have not served on this kind of commission do not know the difficulty of investigating the truth. This kind of management, with unprepared investigations as an indispensable element, and this kind of sudden investigation, is similar to a police random search, which often makes people unhappy.

<p>Also, it is reported that the current dissatisfaction of the American cotton industry with the status quo is a major motivation for the United States to recognize Soviet Russia, because if the United States recognizes Soviet Russia, the Russian side can purchase American cotton.

<p>The Theory of Civilians Appointing Naval Ministers is Eliminated</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The revision of the Naval General Staff Act will be submitted to the Emperor by Naval Minister Osumi on the 25th and 26th, and will be promulgated on the same day after being approved by the Emperor. The focus of the revision is Article 3 of the Naval General Staff Regulations, which states (The Chief of the Naval General Staff participates in matters of national defense and the use of troops, and after review, transfers it to the Minister of the Navy. However, in wartime, when there is no general headquarters, the Chief of the Naval General Staff conveys matters regarding operations). Part of the article has been revised, expanding the command authority of the Chief of the Naval General Staff, regardless of peacetime or wartime. At the same time, there is no doubt that as a result of the revision, the authority of the Minister of the Navy and the Chief of the Naval General Staff regarding the determination of military and political forces determined in July of the Showa 5th year has become more clear. Command matters are initiated by the Chief of the Naval General Staff and consulted with the Minister of the Navy, and military and political matters are initiated by the Minister of the Navy and consulted with the Chief of the Naval General Staff. Therefore, the issue of interfering with the command authority that was provoked at the London Conference is no longer in danger of recurring.

<p>Rejects Three Demands and Accuses False State of Sheltering White Russian Activities</p>
<p>(Harbin) The relationship between Russia (Manchuria) has become even more serious since the exchange of letters between the representatives of both sides stationed in Harbin. The Russian Consul-General in this area, Slavsky, responded to Shi Luben, the (Manchurian) diplomatic negotiator, stating that the (Manchurian) side claimed that in July of this year, Soviet Russian political secret detectives searched the (Manchurian) ship "Dongshan" in (Manchurian) territorial waters. This statement is completely unfounded. He also stated that the three conditions proposed by Shi, (1) the release of the White Russian guards arrested on the "Dongshan" vessel, (2) severely punish the personnel of the Soviet Russian Secret Detective Bureau involved in this case, (3) guarantee that the same incident will not occur again in the future, (4) the Russian side cannot accept or acknowledge any of them, and can only forward them to the Soviet Russian government for its information. The Russian Consul-General later expressed dissatisfaction in his reply note, stating that the (Manchurian) authorities allowed White Russians to infiltrate Russian territory, and that the (Manchurian) side did not take any steps to suppress the White Party leader General Kong Shiming, and other White Party organizations dispatching hostile troops into Russia, which has led to a further deterioration in relations between the two countries. Shi Luben immediately replied to the Russian Consul-General's note, stating that the Russian side should pay attention to the fundamental facts of the case, which cannot be denied by any official explanation. The document also mentioned that when the "Dongshan" vessel was searched, it was within the territorial waters of (Manchukuo), and accused the Soviet Russian Consul-General's explanation of obscuring the facts. As for the Russian note's accusation that the (Manchurian) side does not interfere with White Russian activities, Shi stated that it was a trick by the Russian Consul-General to shift the focus of the dispute. Finally, he stated that the Soviet Russian authorities should immediately accept and implement the three conditions proposed by the (Manchurian) side. (Reuter's telegram on the 23rd)</p>

<p>(Moscow) The Soviet Deputy Director of the China Eastern Railway once sent a letter to the Director of the Railway, exposing that the authorities' protection of the Railway was completely inadequate, and that bandits and railway police were constantly disrupting the Railway's normal transportation operations. The Pravda, in elaborating on this letter, stated that this exposure can be seen as clear evidence of the (two-faced policy) adopted by the Manchurian authorities and their Japanese advisors. The newspaper stated, ("Mr. Kantora's letter shows that not only bandits are engaged in sabotaging and disrupting the work of the China Eastern Railway, but also the Railway's guards rely on damaging tracks and various buildings of the Railway to obstruct the normal operation of the Railway, thereby causing material losses to the Railway.") The newspaper reiterated the following facts, that Japan has adequate troops stationed along this disrupted railway, and that the Japanese authorities in Manchuria are turning a blind eye to the actions of bandits in the eastern section of the China Eastern Railway. The Pravda further stated that although Japanese advisors are vigorously assisting the (Manchurian) authorities in implementing their policy of destroying the railway, foreign exporters are willing to transport their goods eastward, and are unwilling to transport them on the South Manchuria Railway, which offers them all preferential conditions. All these facts show that some Japanese and Manchurian people do not want to abandon their two-faced policy. The Soviet (Manchurian) parties are currently negotiating the sale of the China Eastern Railway, and they are doing everything possible to damage the railway, harass its work, and reduce its freight volume in order to benefit the South Manchuria Railway. They clearly hope that these actions will force the Soviet representatives to make concessions.") The newspaper concluded by saying, ("This policy can only hinder the progress of the Tokyo talks, and will definitely not be conducive to their successful completion, which goes without saying.")

<p>Simla The Simla consultations held preliminary consultations today, the 23rd, and the main conference will begin on the 25th. Britain, Japan, and India are all probing each other's attitudes, so the current situation is chaotic and difficult to grasp. Japan is demanding the restoration of the treaty and the reduction of tariffs, while Britain is using India to try to exclude Japanese influence. In addition, India needs to consider the position of farmers due to the approaching cotton harvest season, and intends to take this opportunity to develop domestic industries. Therefore, the strategies of various countries are quite complex. (Dentsu telegram on the 23rd)</p>
<p>Simla The representatives of Britain and India are currently holding consultations in Mumbai. It is reported that the Indian textile industry seems to oppose concluding a quantity agreement with Britain, and the result will be a vague agreement. Also, in this consultation, the British side will not give a definite answer because the Indian side will request the use of Indian cotton, but instead will ask the Indian textile industry to focus on spinning coarse yarn in future production, saying that the British side is willing to do its best to import this product into Britain, but the current British textile industry cannot use Indian cotton, nor does it intend to do so. Therefore, its attitude towards India is simply ambiguous, so the cunning attitude of the British side makes it difficult to predict the future. (Dentsu telegram on the 23rd)</p>

<h3 id="e37">French Parliamentary Delegation Goes to Italy for On-the-Spot Investigation <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>Prelude to Improving Economic Relations Between the Two Countries</p>
<p>Paris, National News, 22nd A delegation of forty members of the French Senate and Chamber of Deputies set off for Rome today to conduct an on-the-spot investigation of Italy's economic issues. The Italian Ambassador and staff members escorted them to the station. The French parliamentary delegation, led by Senator Lucet and Representative Valensi, will tour Italy for two weeks. After meeting Italian Prime Minister Mussolini in Rome tomorrow, they will be accompanied by the reception committee chaired by Italian Finance Minister Reng to tour the Italian capital for two days, and then take a special train to Naples, Florence, Venice, Milan, Turin, and other cities to inspect factories, rural areas, and the wine industry. Although the departure of the parliamentary delegation today does not carry any mission from the government, it is reported that French Prime Minister Daladier has high hopes for it. Since the European War, Franco-Italian relations have been affected by nationalism in both diplomacy and economy, and there have been some estrangements. The visit of the parliamentary delegation to Italy is not only a sign of the new friendship between France and Italy after the Four-Power Pact, but also a prelude to improving economic relations. Because after the failure of the London Economic Conference, improving Franco-Italian economic relations is the most important and difficult issue for the Daladier government. Although the parliamentarians do not have the power to negotiate and amend tariffs, Daladier really hopes that they can obtain sufficient records and return to the country, so as to lay the foundation for the two countries to eliminate existing barriers. Because this move must be supported by both houses of parliament, Daladier has high expectations for the trip of the parliamentarians. It is reported that the parliamentarians are scheduled to return to the country on October 6, and Parliament will open a week later.</p>

<p>Drafts Industry Regulations and Asks Government to Approve</p>
<p>Havas, 22nd Des Moines, Iowa, USA A total of 1,200 members of the National Farmers' Association, representing agriculture in 12 states, unanimously passed a national farmers' strike proposal, stating that if President Roosevelt does not accept the industry regulations drafted by the Farmers' Association, they will go on strike. The main points of this industry regulation are (1) the prices of agricultural products should be guaranteed by the government, (2) the daily work hours should be 10 hours, (3) wages should be stipulated by the National Federation of Labor. In addition, the Farmers' Association also asked President Roosevelt to approve the following two matters, namely (1) immediately use the power granted by Congress to the President to implement inflation policies, (2) issue new banknotes in order to immediately pay the alimony of retired veterans.</p>
<p>Havas, 22nd Washington The New York Tribune reported that serious difficulties seem to have occurred within the Roosevelt government. The newspaper explained the reason, saying that (regardless of whether the people have felt it, people in the government are quite disappointed with the experiment of economic recovery), and said that the reason for this difficulty is that the economic recovery plan has aroused the movement of inflation. Now the farmers are the first to demand inflation, and the reason why their attitude is like this is because the economic recovery policy has greatly increased the value of retail goods, and they feel that they are relatively inferior.</p>

<p>The Public Hails the President's Speech with Fervent Cheers</p>
<p>Political System Reform: Various Factions Laboriously Consider</p>
<p>The Capture of Rebel Leader Herlandes Has Not Been Verified</p>
<p>Havana Since Cuban President Grau San Martin took office, he gave his first official speech to the people today, declaring that Cuba has obtained freedom for the first time in history. The freedom mentioned by San Martin refers to getting rid of the fetters of the United States and the control of the reactionaries. There were many listeners in front of the Presidential Palace, all cheering fervently. However, although San Martin spoke of national peace, news came again today that a serious rebellion had occurred in Maitanzai Province, and the details are unknown. Maitanzai is a neighboring province to Havana. (National News on the 22nd)</p>
<p>Havana Army Sergeant Batista issued a declaration saying that if the country is in danger because he is the leader of the army, then he is prepared to remain a sergeant. At present, the hungry people in the interior of Cuba are beyond the control of the government. The leaders of various political parties continue to meet to discuss what kind of political system should be adopted. Some political parties are drafting a plan to recognize President San Martin's continued tenure, and a revolutionary committee organized by various political parties will supervise him closely. Other parties advocate using pan-Americanism to establish a strong government. At this time, the government is still fighting against the rebel party led by Herlandes. The news of Her's capture has not been confirmed (Havas News on the 22nd).</p>
<p>Havana Cuba's capital is superficially peaceful, but there are strong undercurrents. The San Martin government is still at odds with its enemy parties. It is expected that the government will reject the enemy parties' request for San Martin to resign. The resentment about the lack of food supply is now becoming increasingly obvious. If the situation does not ease immediately, the rebellion that is now lurking will inevitably break out. Government troops and the rebels led by Colonel Herlandes had their first conflict in Camaguey Province today. Two people died on Her's side, and several government soldiers were injured. (Reuter's telegram on the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Washington) The US government is now negotiating with the Cuban government about the robbery of American residences in Havana. Secretary of State Hull stated today that the State Department has not received robbery information, but it seems that no one was injured. The situation in the interior of Cuba is more peaceful, but the situation in Havana is very tense. Several more homes were robbed in Havana yesterday, and many Americans have taken refuge on US warships due to the increasingly chaotic atmosphere. (Reuter's telegram on the 22nd)</p>

<p>The Defendant from the Communist Party of Cloth Chattered Endlessly in Court</p>
<p>Russian Journalists Appeared in Court as Observers and Were Searched</p>
<p>Reuter's, Leipzig, 23rd Ruber, the fifth defendant in the Reichstag fire case being tried here, is now refusing to eat. His lawyer asked for a doctor to sit beside the defendant when the trial began this morning. The court approved it. The defendant bowed his head and shoulders, still appearing lifeless, occasionally making inexplicable smiles. Dimitrov, the leader of the Communist Party of Cloth, was summoned to the court and admitted that when he lived abroad, the Cloth court had sentenced him to death in absentia. He saw this matter in foreign newspapers. Dimitrov is a writer, 41 years old this year. After Dimitrov entered the witness stand, he spoke to the court, gesticulating as if he were in a political conference seat. He had a war of words with the lawyer's summary and the president of the court, and refused to recognize the lawyer designated by the court as his defender. Di admitted that he had tried not to reveal his real name in Berlin, and admitted that he was a propertyless revolutionary. He then accused the authorities of searching his apartment, causing the couple who lived with him to almost commit suicide. When Mr. Di mentioned this matter, he argued fiercely with the President of the Court, Buenger. The court then warned Mr. Di that if he continued to act absurdly, he would be expelled from the court. Mr. Di is one of the five defendants in this case.</p>
<p>Havas, 22nd Paris The Daily News published a message today saying that yesterday, the German Supreme Court in Leipzig opened the trial of the House of Representatives fire case. Two Soviet Russian journalists attended the hearing, one was Mrs. Katz, a journalist from the government organ newspaper Izvestia, and the other was Mr. Pasbarov, a journalist from TASS. Both were arrested by the Leipzig Police Chief in the morning. They were released after serious negotiations by the secretary of the Soviet Russian Embassy in Berlin. At that time, they had been detained for seven hours. All parts of the two people's bodies were carefully searched. Mr. Basbarov also said that the police said to him, if you dare to escape, you will be shot. Although the German Police Chief has apologized, according to the Daily News, it is feared that diplomatic problems will inevitably occur.</p>

<p>Chén Wò and Yán Zhòngrú Retreat to the Guizhou Border</p>
<p>Chén Qúzhēn Cables Hé Jiàn with News of Victory</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: Hé Jiàn's former subordinates, Brigade Commander Chén Wò and Division Commander Yán Zhòngrú, were dismissed from their posts last year due to various reasons, and their troops were reorganized and disbanded. After being relieved of their commands, Chén and Yán harbored resentment and, in May of this year, colluded with miscellaneous troops in western Hunan, occupying Zhījiāng, Qiányáng, and Huàng counties. They raised the banner of rebellion against Hé, issuing a public telegram listing various accusations against Hé Jiàn. Hé Jiàn then mobilized Chén Qúzhēn's division and the two brigades of Lǐ Guójūn and Chén Zǐxián, launching a large-scale offensive. Because miscellaneous troops in western Hunan and bandits such as Yáo Jìyú, Zhōu Yùchéng, and Liào Xiāngyún (former commander of the Hǔmén Fortress) responded to Chén Wò, the anti-Hé forces became quite strong. Therefore, after three or four months of siege by the Hé army, Zhījiāng County was finally captured on August 25th. Chén, Yán, and their troops, numbering about three or four regiments, retreated to the area around Xióngshān on the border of Zhījiāng, Máyáng, and Lúxī. Hé Jiàn again telegraphed Chén Qúzhēn's troops to be responsible for the pursuit and ordered the two brigades of Lǐ Guójūn and Chén Zǐxián to handle the aftermath in the Zhījiāng, Qián, and Huàng area. Chén Qúzhēn then dispatched the brigade of Lǐ Kědá and the regiment of Liú Wénzhāng from his command, starting on September 9th, to pursue in separate routes until the 16th, when the situation was resolved. Chén and Yán both retreated to the border of Guizhou Province. The following is a report from Chén Qúzhēn: (Your subordinate has repeatedly telegraphed reports regarding the pursuit and suppression of the rebel troops of Chén and Yán. Recently, it was reported that the majority of the rebels had fled to Xióngshān on the border of Zhī, Má, and Lú, where they were stubbornly resisting. Subsequently, under the command of Regiment Commander Liú Wénzhāng, our troops launched a fierce attack. The rebels, due to insufficient food supplies, secretly moved from Xióngshān to Yánzhài, Héshuǐ, Sōngyú, and other places on a beautiful evening, attempting to flee back to Máyáng, Shàngshān, Gǎngshí, and secretly enter the Guizhou Province border to gather and cause trouble. Your subordinate ordered Regiment Commander Liú to pursue and also ordered Second Brigade Commander Tián Liúshǒushìyuán, stationed in Má, to supervise the military groups and deploy them at Wèngtǒng, Diàoyán, Tángjiāwān, and other places to intercept. The enemy's situation was extremely desperate. Later, they changed their route, fleeing through Liǎngxī Bābā'ào and secretly entering Zàonítán in Fèng county, planning to take the road through Xīncáng to enter Guizhou. Your subordinate also ordered First Brigade Commander Lǐ Kědá to send troops to lie in ambush near Huánghèyíng to intercept them. Unexpectedly, the rebel troops had already secretly arrived at Huánghèyíng and occupied Xīnzàiyíng and Ānjìng Guān. Just as Regiment Commander Liú and his military groups had arrived in pursuit, they launched a joint attack on the rebel troops at dawn on a cold day, engaging in a fierce battle until 3 PM, killing many rebels. The remaining rebels, due to running out of ammunition, voluntarily surrendered their weapons and were sent away. In this battle, a total of over seven hundred and fifty rifles and carbines were seized, with only one or two rows of bullets per gun. According to the prisoners, after leaving Xióngshān, Yán had fled alone to Shěng Huàng, where the provinces of Hunan and Guizhou meet. Chén, after fleeing to Tiānqípíng, mingled with Zhōu Yùchéng's bandit troops and secretly returned to Zhōu's fortress in Bàoxī. After distributing the seized weapons to the various regiments for use and sending away the rebel officers and soldiers, after thoroughly investigating and detaining them, in summary, your subordinate was ordered to supervise the suppression and has successively seized over eight hundred and forty rebel rifles. Currently, there are no traces of the rebels within the four borders of your subordinate's defense zone. The matter of how to compensate the wounded and killed personnel and reward the deserving officers and soldiers should be reasonably reported by telegram. I humbly request your review and instructions for compliance. Respectfully submitted by your subordinate Chén Qúzhēn, sealed) (September 18)</p>

<p>Russian Troops Fill the Opposite Bank of the Great Black River　　Fortified Bunkers Built on Important Bridges　　Military Farming Communities Established in Garrison Areas　　Air Bases Constructed in Vladivostok and Other Places　　Harbin Correspondence: Soviet Russia has recently been strengthening its military preparations in the Primorsky Krai. The sale of the Eastern Railway is unlikely to be realized for the time being. However, it is actively preparing for war against Japan and its puppet state. The opposite bank of the Great Black River is filled with Red Army soldiers. Fortified bunkers have been built near important bridges on the Amur Railway to defend against air raids. A special winter fuel mobilization for 1933 has been ordered along the Trans-Baikal and Ussuri lines. Military farming communities have been established in garrison areas in the Far East. The Soviet Union's most potent weapon is its air force. Once war breaks out between Japan and Russia, Russian aircraft could easily fly to Japanese territory and bomb it. The details are listed below:</p>
<h3 id="e65">Double Tracks Between Omsk and Irkutsk <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Before the Russian Revolution of 1917, the Siberian Railway had double tracks. However, in the years following the revolution, one track was dismantled, and all transportation relied on a single track. Now, the double tracks between Omsk and Irkutsk (the section from western Siberia to the west bank of Lake Baikal) have been laid. The sleepers on that section have been replaced, and the ballast has been laid. However, the rolling stock is in poor condition, and delays and derailments are common, causing damage to the locomotives. The main repair shop in Krasnoyarsk lacks skilled workers, and there is a shortage of parts and materials. The outdated equipment used for repairs is also an obstacle. In fact, the situation in all the repair shops along the line is similar. At major stations, damaged cars and locomotives are often parked, one after another. Some of these have the symbols of the Chinese Eastern Railway, and these cars are mostly used by the Red Army and are not allocated for commercial transport. Before the revolution, the Russian Far Eastern Railway could be divided into three sections: the Trans-Baikal section, connecting Irkutsk, Manzhouli, and Sretensk; the Amur section, leading to Khabarovsk; and the Ussuri section, connecting Khabarovsk and Vladivostok, with branch lines to Shuangcheng and Suifenhe. Currently, this division has changed. Between Irkutsk and Vladivostok, it is now divided into two sections: the Trans-Baikal and Ussuri railways, in addition to the former Amur section. The junction between these two lines is at Ruklov, the northernmost point on the Amur River (i.e., the Heilongjiang River), which is where the plane of the recent American global aviator Mattern was forced to land. The Trans-Baikal Railway is also divided into two sections. One runs along the shore of Lake Baikal and has double tracks. The other is a wartime track, a single track that goes directly to Vladivostok. However, to compensate, extra sidings have been built in several places to shorten the distance between major stations. In case of emergency, this would facilitate increased traffic. These sidings are built according to the tunnels, bridges, and terrain, spaced five, eight, or ten kilometers apart. Spacing of fifteen kilometers is rare.</p>

<p>The bridges on the Amur Railway were mostly temporary wooden structures in the past, but now they have been almost completely replaced with reinforced concrete structures. Near the tunnels and important bridges, fortified bunkers have been built with flat roofs that can withstand air raids. Small squads of soldiers are stationed in the bunkers, carrying machine guns and anti-aircraft guns. Ditches and other obstacles have also been built. The Trans-Baikal and Ussuri lines have adequate fuel supplies, but the former Amur section is severely lacking in fuel. The coal used comes from the Jifu Dingski coal mine, and the quality is poor. To remedy this, the Soviet authorities have ordered a special winter fuel preparation mobilization for 1933.</p>

<p>The Siberian Express runs only twice a week, and most of the transportation is for military supplies. Many goods are transported from European Russia, including various kinds of machinery. Recently, large quantities of pressed fodder for cavalry use have been transported. These items are labeled as supplies for collective farms. For example, military tanks are labeled as farm machinery. According to recent news, since March of this year, the Amur line has been managed by the Red Army. Political agents on the line are under the command of the Red Army's political department.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Airfields Built in Vladivostok <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Since June or July of last year, the Amur Oblast has been undergoing large-scale military preparations. All activities along the road and in the towns are related to a practical military plan and are under military command. Since last year, efforts have been made to strengthen the defenses along the riverbank. This work is carried out by special engineering troops, engineers, and workers brought from European Russia, and guided by Germans in Red Army uniforms. No one is allowed to enter the area near these projects without permission, not even the local political agents. The Soviet Union is particularly focused on air defense in this region. Several airfields have been built between Ruklov and Khabarovsk. The airfield at Ruklov is particularly large, with maintenance areas, factories, and ammunition depots. The number of aircraft is unknown due to strict military secrecy. However, it is known that airfields have been built at the following locations: Bogarifu, Yakharara, Dikongkaiya, Boyakov, Khabarovsk, Spassk, Shuangchengzi, Vladivostok, Posyet, Yanuchino, Rasdolnoye, Su-zhuang, and Olga Bay. Air bases have also been built in the Okhotsk and Kamchatka regions. Although soldiers are not often seen in public places, air force personnel are frequently seen. They wear neat uniforms and enjoy special privileges, and their rations are supplied by special agencies, which other troops cannot access. It is said that their aviation skills are excellent and that they have all graduated from renowned aviation schools.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Military Farms Organized <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Before the European War and the Russian Revolution, the Russian authorities, in order to wash away the shame of the Russo-Japanese War, stationed heavy troops in the Far East and built special forts. However, these facilities are now insufficient to accommodate the large number of Red Army troops. Therefore, the Soviet military authorities have established garrison areas, building barracks and residences suitable for both winter and summer. These garrison areas are separated from civilian residences by wide fences and electric fences. The families of officers and soldiers live in these areas. The Soviet Union once planned to organize military farming communities, providing them with good land and excellent tools. Currently, there are two military collective farms in the Amur Oblast, one in Tambovsky and one in Konstantinovsky.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Air Force Weapons Are Excellent <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>The strength of the Red Army should not be underestimated. Other countries' armies in the Far East will realize that they are not easy opponents once they engage with them. The Soviet Union's specialty is its air force. If war breaks out between Japan and Russia, Russian aircraft could easily fly to Japanese territory and bomb it. The defensive works are also very strong. The Red Army's weapons and equipment are excellent. There is a small type of tank that can accommodate two machine gunners and can travel thirty kilometers per hour on any type of road. The infantry uses automatic rifles, and there are new types of large and heavy artillery that can be transported by heavy trucks. Military training is also very thorough. The political espionage organization is a characteristic of the Red Army, ensuring that the soldiers are not discouraged. In short, the Red Army in the Far East today is preparing and eager to try its strength. (Northeast News Agency)</p>

<h3 id="e75">New Record for Transportation Between Guangzhou and Shantou <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Highway Through Transport Implemented, Telephone System Completed</p>
<p>Transportation between Shantou and Guangzhou has long relied on maritime transport, transiting through Hong Kong into the Pearl River. Foreigners controlled the maritime shipping business, and direct ships between Guangzhou and Shantou were scarce. Three years ago, only the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Shanghai-Guangdong route had four or five ships per month passing through Shantou to Guangzhou. The journey was slow, taking twenty-six hours to arrive, and the docking at Bai'etan (White Swan Pool) made loading and unloading inconvenient. Therefore, most people traveling from Shantou to the provincial capital took the route through Hong Kong. In the last two years, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company almost stopped running the Shanghai-Guangdong line, making it impossible to travel between Guangzhou and Shantou without going through Hong Kong. The Guangdong government, aware of the difficulties of sea transport between Guangzhou and Shantou, worked hard to build the first trunk line of the Eastern Provincial Highway. This line is two hundred miles long, starting from Haitoujiao Shiqu Wutian in Shantou, passing through Chaoyang Yuxia Sima Pu, entering Puning Liusha district, exiting Huilai Kuitan, turning to Lufeng Haifeng Pingshan, and ending at Tai'an Station on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, connecting to the Guangzhou-Kowloon train to the provincial capital. This road was completed last winter, with only a few bridges yet to be finished. Previously, merchants had jointly funded a transportation company, and the Department of Construction had approved its operating franchise for a fixed number of years. However, each merchant operated independently on different sections, making transfers very difficult. Vehicles often failed to arrive at transfer points on time. Considering this, the provincial government, to facilitate transportation between the province and Shantou, decided to take back the three sections of the highway: Pu-Shan, Ping-Ren, and Hui-Ping, and operate them officially. On September 8th, Li Hua, the director of the Eastern Highway Bureau, was ordered to take over all vehicles and assets of the Ji Feng Company in the Pu-Shan section and set up an office in the Highway Bureau, with Li Hua concurrently serving as the general director. The office has three departments: General Affairs, Vehicle Affairs, and Engineering. Operations began on September 9th, with vehicles running as usual, and all income going to the government. According to Li Hua, an evaluation committee will soon be formed, with Chen Guoji appointed by the Department of Construction, Wang Yaochang by the Eastern District Public Office, and Wu Keqiang by the Highway Bureau. However, the First Army Group, the Municipal Government, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Chaoyang Senate, and the Puning Senate have not yet appointed members. After the committee determines the price, the privately held shares will be repaid accordingly. It is also reported that the Ping-Ren and Hui-Ping sections are expected to be completely taken over this month. Before Double Ten Day (October 10th), through transport between Guangzhou and Shantou will be available. The Highway Bureau has purchased a large number of long-distance buses, which are being renovated. There are company-operated electric ferries from Shantou to Wutian across the sea and from Lei Shi to Houxi in Chaoyang across the sea. There is also a public ferry between Pingshan. There are eleven stations along the way. The journey starts from Shantou at 6:00 AM and arrives in the provincial capital at 7:30 PM. As for the ticket price, it needs to be determined in consultation with the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway Bureau.</p>
<p>There were already wireless and wired telegraphs between Guangzhou and Shantou. In recent years, with local stability, their use has become quite convenient. This year, in June, a wireless telephone was installed, with the Shantou station located in Zhongshan Park. It has now been completely installed and the test results are good. It is scheduled to officially open on October 1st. The communication methods are: (A) Registration Method: (1) Households with automatic telephones can communicate at any time after paying a deposit. (2) Those without automatic telephones can bring their certificate to the station and communicate after paying a deposit. (3) Those who have not registered can also go to the station, pay the registration fee, and communicate immediately. The temporary registration fee will be refunded after the call is completed. (B) Types of Calls: (1) Regular calls: Can only be made to a specific number, not to a specific person. (2) Special calls: Can be made to a specific person. (3) Scheduled calls: Can be scheduled to communicate at a specific time every day. (4) Urgent calls: Can be made immediately, with instant connection. (C) Fee Schedule: For the first three minutes or less, regular calls cost three yuan, special calls cost three yuan and nine jiao, and scheduled calls are calculated as regular calls if scheduled more than fifteen days in advance. Urgent calls are charged double the rate. After the first three minutes, each additional minute or less costs one yuan for regular calls and one yuan and three jiao for special calls. Scheduled calls are charged an additional 30%. The above methods have been stipulated by the Department of Construction and issued to Shantou. The registration fee (i.e., registration of address) is twenty yuan per year and must be paid even for temporary calls, which will be refunded after the call. (September 15th)</p>

<p>Husband and Wife Commit Suicide by Poison</p>
<p>Xu Yuanqing, the owner of Xu Yichang Rice Shop in Kuatang Bridge, Songjiang, was known for his frugality and had accumulated considerable wealth. His third son, Xu Shunguan, married the daughter of Yang Yunquan, an eye doctor in the city. The couple felt harmonious, but Shunguan had been dissolute in the past, which his father disapproved of. In recent years, he had slightly reformed. He felt ashamed of his financial situation because his father had removed him from his sight. Last month, he was at a Le Ye Tea House listening to flower drum opera. Shunguan, encouraged by friends, ordered four plays. He did not pay for the plays at the time. Until the other day, the tea house owner went to the shop to demand payment. Shunguan took four silver dollars from the shop and paid. Yuanqing found out about this and was furious. He rebuked and ordered him to leave home, forbidding him from entering, to show his determination. Shunguan returned and told his wife. Because the couple's feelings were very deep, they did not want to be separated. So each secretly took sleeping pills and committed suicide together. His wife died first. Shunguan took a lighter dose and did not die. Now, Yang Yunquan's family has raised the matter. The local prosecutor's office also came to examine the body after receiving the report. The examination confirmed that they died from poison.</p>

<p>The dangerous situation of the sea dike in Jinshanwei, Punan, has been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. The most dangerous part is from Queerli to Qijia Dun, about seventeen li long. The stone foundation of the dike is exposed, and there is no slope. The tide rushes here violently, already directly impacting the base of the dike. If something unfortunate happens, the counties of Songjiang, Fengxian, and Jinshan may all become a watery land, and the loss of life and property would be incalculable. Yesterday, the county chamber of commerce, the property management office, and other organizations urgently telegraphed the provincial government for help, requesting the dispatch of personnel and allocation of funds for repairs as soon as possible. Commissioner Jin Tiqian has decided to hire a public bus at 7:00 AM tomorrow (the 23rd) to go directly to Jinshanwei for inspection, accompanied by Provincial Committee member Shen Zhengshu, county government technical director Xu Mojiia, secretary Wu Zhongyu, and guards. The findings of the inspection will be reported to the provincial government.</p>

The sales of salt permits in various places have increased significantly. According to recent surveys, the Fourth District under the bureau's jurisdiction has achieved the most notable results in patrolling. The sales of salt permits in various places in the entire district have been flourishing month by month this year. July's sales exceeded the target by more than 1,200 permits, and August's sales exceeded the target by more than 800 permits, totaling a surplus of more than 2,000 permits in two months.</p>

<p>Zhu Yunting Kidnapped and Escapes Dangerously</p>
<p>Zhu Yunting, a famous doctor in the second district of the county (Jingyun City), was kidnapped by four or five bandits at Yaohua Tan, about two li north of Gaochang'an in the sixth district, on the evening of the 15th of this month. Zhu's family repeatedly sent a family member, Zhou Afu, to contact the bandits. Because the ransom was too high, no agreement was reached. It is now known that after this case occurred, County Magistrate Yan Shenyu immediately ordered the chief of police, Wu Zhengrong, to conduct a thorough investigation and rescue the victim. After receiving the order, Chief Wu led the police in disguise to investigate in the area where the incident occurred and in the Yianqiao Zhangcun Temple area. After several days, there were clues to be found. The other night, Zhu Yunting took advantage of the fact that the guard was asleep and quietly escaped from the bandit's den and safely returned home. He described in detail the process of being kidnapped and the suffering he endured, sobbing as he spoke, tears streaming down his face, a tragic sight. It is also heard that Zhu was kidnapped by bandits once five years ago, losing more than 3,000 yuan before being able to return home. This is the second time he has been kidnapped, and his escape is a fortunate event.</p>
<h3 id="e80">Bailiff Accused of Fraud and Indecent Assault <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Xu Xinren, a bailiff of the county court, is a relative of Xu Tiqian, the president of the court. He came to Wuxi with President Xu to serve. On the afternoon of July 11th of this year, Ren Yingbo and Ren Zhuqing, villagers of Dongxiang Township in the third district of the county, were involved in a lawsuit over a debt. The court sent Xu Xinren to the township to deliver a civil mediation summons. After Xu arrived in the township, he immediately summoned Zhang Huitian, the head of the twenty-fifth tu, and led him to Ren Zhuqing's house. Because Zhuqing was doing business in Shanghai, the summons was received by his relative, Ren Hesheng. Afterwards, Ren Hesheng alleged that Xu Xinren had demanded two silver dollars from him at the time and had indecently assaulted his daughter-in-law, Ren Qiu. Zhang Huitian, the head of the district, was also accused of assisting in the extortion and indecently assaulting his daughter, Guiying. Therefore, they filed a complaint with the county court's prosecutor's office. Yesterday, prosecutor Ren opened a court session to investigate. As a result, Xu Xinren and Zhang Huitian were both released on bail, and Ren Hesheng, Ren Qiu, and others were all ordered to return home.</p>

<p>Labor Dispute in the Thread-Making Industry</p>
<p>Li Jinyong, Ge Qiming, Yi Jinquan, and other workers in the Zhenjiang thread-making industry previously stated that the capital side (Jing Huo Shop) had suddenly announced to all workers on the first day of this month that if they wanted to continue working on thread, they would be paid 70% of the usual wage, otherwise, they could strike. Later, in order to avoid disputes, the labor side temporarily swallowed their anger and continued to work as usual. However, the labor and capital sides had regulations stipulating that neither side could unilaterally renege on the agreement. In addition, the workers' usual wages were not enough to live on, let alone if they were paid 70% of the usual wage. Therefore, they jointly submitted a petition to the Zhenjiang County Party Department yesterday, requesting the dispatch of personnel to mediate and ordering the capital side to pay the originally agreed-upon wage so that the workers' livelihoods could be maintained and to prevent a strike from occurring.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Gaoyou <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Detailed Report on Party Members Petitioning in the Provincial Capital</p>
<p>More than one hundred party members in this county, including Geng Boyang, believed that Zhang Tingjie and others on the Party Committee were manipulating party affairs and engaging in self-interest and corruption. With the Sixth County Representative Congress about to open, Zhang and others, in order to cling to their positions, specially sent people to Anhui Province and neighboring counties to contact and recruit more than eighty party members to come to Gaoyou to participate in the election. Geng and others repeatedly reported this to the Provincial Party Department according to law. Subsequently, the Provincial Party Department ordered Zhang and others not to transfer Anhui and other county party members to Gaoyou and scheduled the representative meeting to be held on September 15th. Seeing that they were about to be defeated, Zhang and others repeatedly went to the provincial capital to lobby for a postponement in order to find ways to communicate with the various party members. Because the representative meeting was not held on schedule and the provincial supervisor had not arrived in Gaoyou, party members Geng Boyang and others, along with more than seventy party members, went to the provincial capital on the 15th. At 8:00 AM on the 16th, they went to the Provincial Party Department to petition. Because Provincial Executive Committee member Zhou Shaocheng and others were out on official business at that time, they were received by alternate Executive Committee member Chen Kanghe. Geng and others questioned Chen as to why he had not arrived in Gaoyou to supervise the election on schedule. Chen replied that he had not received an appointment order and could not go to Gaoyou. Geng and others refuted him one by one, and Chen was left speechless. He then drafted a resignation from his position as supervisor in Gaoyou. When the party members caught a glimpse of this draft, they all questioned Chen, asking why he was now resigning if he had not been appointed, clearly showing a contradiction. Chen remained silent throughout. The various staff members of the Provincial Party Department then mediated, and the party members dispersed. However, when they arrived in the reception room, they suddenly saw Zhang Tingjie and others also following them to the provincial capital to lobby. The party members stopped and refused to leave. At that time, Provincial Executive Committee member Zhang Gongren happened to enter from outside and brought Zhang Tingjie and Chen Jiaxiang, representing the petitioning party members, to the Standing Committee's office for talks. Chen Jiaxiang first detailed Zhang and others' self-interest and corruption in Gaoyou, and then Zhang stood up to defend himself. Finally, the Provincial Committee slightly reprimanded Zhang, and everyone left the Provincial Party Department. On the morning of the 19th, the Provincial Party Department held an Executive Committee meeting and decided that the County Representative Congress would be held on October 12th and would not be postponed again. The petitioning party members were satisfied and returned to Gaoyou last night (the 20th).</p>

<p>Security Bureau Executes Two Kidnappers by Shooting</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Security Bureau, due to the kidnapping of Cao Along, the young son of Cao Jijing of Shicun Cao Village in Xiaoshan, by Fang Sandwaizi (Fang the shorty) in collusion with Zhu Lixiang, Li Cailang (Li Qianlao), and Hua Along on the night of August 9th of last year, who was hidden in the home of Wang Ziqing in Shanghai, sent detectives to Shanghai to arrest Zhu Lixiang and Li Cailang and rescued the kidnapped person, Cao Ayu, from Wang Ziqing's home, along with Wang Ziqing's wife, Wang Zhushi, and sent personnel to escort them to the Bureau. At that time, the kidnapped person, Cao Ayu, was returned to Cao Jijing. According to the confessions of the two criminals, Zhu and Li, which were undeniable, except that Wang Ziqing and Zhushi were unaware of the situation beforehand, they were transferred to the court for trial. Li Cailang and Zhu Lixiang were sentenced to death according to law. Yesterday (the 23rd) at 10:00 AM, the two bandits were brought out, their identities were verified, and they were escorted to a vacant lot outside Qingbo Gate and executed by shooting.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Special Article: Preface to the Shaanxi Yinluo Project Plan, by Li Xie <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>The Guanzhong Plain is a fertile land, extremely beneficial for agriculture. Its soil is yellow, but it is threatened by drought. The Weibei Plain has already benefited from the Jinghui Canal, and now there are plans to divert the Luo River. I am a child of the Luo River area. Every time I climb high and look deep, I sigh that time passes like this, without being able to make use of it. Considering the failure of the Longshou Canal during the Han Dynasty (please read the History of the Han Dynasty, Records of Canals and Ditches), I did not dare to advocate it empty-handedly. However, Zheng has the achievements of previous sages, making it easier to gain people's trust. Therefore, for ten years, I have focused on diverting the Jing River. Fortunately, with the power of the state and the help of society, success was celebrated. To date, branch canals are not yet widespread, but 500,000 mu have already been irrigated. With the development of water conservancy, agricultural experts and industrialists have come one after another to assist farmers in expanding their careers. How can I not be delighted? Several years ago, people from Dali offered a plan to open a canal. At that time, the focus was on the Jing project, and there was no time to look east. Last year, the Jing Canal was already releasing water, so I resigned from the Department of Construction to devote myself to water conservancy. The Water Conservancy Bureau was established, and I immediately sent two engineers, Fu Jian and Chen Jing, to explore the secluded valleys along the Luo River, as well as the Baishui Nan River. At that time, I was already ill. Fu and Chen returned and reported to me the outline. I then gave instructions on the pillow, drawing lines on the map, and had them remeasure to find the site for diverting water between the large and small valleys, following the river and ravines to tunnel through the Iron Chain Mountains and reach the plains of Dali and Chaoyi. In the past, when the Han Dynasty tunneled the Longshou Canal, they followed the right bank of the Luo River. Because the soil was high, they dug wells section by section to reach Longyang. Its failure was also due to the fact that the soil was too deep and untamed, and the water flowed through it, causing it to collapse. Now, my plan is different from the ancients. Taking the left bank, the original terrain is lower and flatter, and there are many ravines, making it easier to save on earthwork. Fu and Chen remeasured the water level from the valleys and reached the plains at Hancun. They then returned with a sketch, and I was certain that it could be done. I told Chairman Yang, "The Jinghui Canal was completed by your hand. Will you also complete the Luohui Canal?" Chairman Yang was delighted and urged me to move forward with all my might, but I was already very ill again. Knowing that my carbuncle was dangerous, I transferred Sun Shaozong, the deputy chief engineer of the Jinghui Canal, and recommended him to Chairman Yang to serve as the chief engineer and take full responsibility. I then moved into the hospital. Later, I lingered in bed. Chairman Yang, together with Sun and other experts, went to survey and assess. Soon, the Luohui Canal Engineering Bureau was established in Dali. After seven months of surveying and design, the plan was completed. Chairman Yang and Sun frequently visited my bedside to report on the progress and comfort me. My illness improved slightly, and I rested at the Confucius Temple in Xi'an, where I was able to read books. Sun then presented the plan. At that time, the newly appointed Chairman Shao Gong Lizi came to inspect it and praised the meticulous design and precise calculations, saying that he would definitely continue Chairman Yang's aspirations and vigorously promote its implementation. According to the plan, a dam will be built at Lao, diverting water through a canal that is more than 20 kilometers long to reach the plains. There, a diversion gate will be set up, dividing the canal into three. One is the East Main Canal, which runs east to the Yellow River Beach, more than 28 kilometers long. One is the West Main Canal, which runs west into the Luo River, more than 12 kilometers long. One is the Central Main Canal, which runs south to Changjiapo, 6 kilometers long. From there, it will be divided into east and west canals, a total of 32 kilometers long. From these main canals, it will be divided into tributaries to irrigate the fields, potentially 500,000 mu. The estimated cost is only 1,215,000 national currency. My initial plan was to build a bridge across the Luo River and divert water from the West Main Canal to irrigate the southern border of Pucheng. However, whether the water allocation is allowed is subject to the continued observation of the Luo River water measurement station. The land through which the Jing and Wei rivers flow is the same cotton-producing area, with Dali and Chaoyi being particularly prosperous. The quality of the cotton is comparable to American cotton. In the future, the Jinghui Canal will be expanded, and the Luohui Canal will be completed as soon as possible. There will be more than one million mu of good cotton fields, and each mu can harvest one dan of ginned cotton, that is, one million dan of cotton that can be spun into fine yarn can be produced each year. How can its contribution to the national economy be small? Now, before the plan is printed, I will write this preface. Written by Li Xie at the Nanjing Lizhi Society on September 21, 1933.</p>

<p>Minister of Finance Song Ziwen left Beijing on the Haiguan patrol ship "Meteor" at 11:00 AM the day before yesterday and arrived in Shanghai. At 11:00 AM yesterday morning, the ship arrived in the heart of the Yangshupu River. Tang Hai'an, the Superintendent of the Jianghai Customs, sent the Jinghui small boat to greet it. At 11:10 AM, he landed at the Xinguang Wharf. At 11:30 AM, he arrived at his private residence on Qiqi Road to rest. Those who accompanied Song to Shanghai included his wife, Ms. Zhang Leyi, and two daughters, as well as only a few attendants. Vice Minister of Finance Zou Lin, Director of the Customs Administration Shen Shuyu, and Director of the Yellow River Flood Relief Committee Zhou Xiangxian, all arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning by night train from Beijing. It is reported that Minister Song's visit is to plan for the relief of the Yellow River flood and to discuss sales methods for American cotton and wheat, the first batch of which will arrive in Shanghai soon, and to collect payments from cotton merchants and yarn factories. After arriving at his residence yesterday morning, Song asked the various reporters who visited to reschedule to tomorrow (the 25th) at noon at his residence due to travel fatigue.</p>

<h3 id="e89">Jiang Zuobin Will Return to His Post at the Beginning of the Month <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>The reporter first inquired about the issue of Ambassador to Japan Jiang Zuobin returning to his post. According to the reply, Jiang had been recuperating from illness in Lushan and has now returned to Beijing. He will come to Shanghai soon to handle all affairs and is determined to return to his post at the beginning of next month. It is also learned that Jiang will go to Suzhou before going to Japan. As for the newly appointed Ambassador to Germany Liu Chongjie, he has also decided to take a ship from Shanghai at the beginning of next month to assume his new post.</p>

<p>Regarding the issue of the proposal of the Chinese delegation at the upcoming meeting of the League of Nations Administrative Council, Tang stated that in addition to firmly declaring that China does not recognize the establishment of (Manchukuo), the Chinese delegation has no other important proposals. As for the Sino-Japanese issue, it is inaccurate for some to claim that they will force direct negotiations. In fact, there is no possibility of direct negotiations between China and Japan.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Huang Will Go North Immediately Unless He is Passive <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Tang also said that Huang Yingbai, the Chairman of the Administrative Council's Political Affairs Committee stationed in Peiping, has been slow to return to Peiping. Although this is related to the issue of replacing the Director of the Peiping Public Security Bureau, it is inaccurate to say that Huang is therefore being passive. Because there are still some unfinished matters in Shanghai, he must return north soon. In addition, the issue of reorganizing the Jiangsu Provincial Government has never been discussed by the Executive Yuan, and it has not been formally submitted by the Central Political Committee. However, there have been reports of reorganization.</p>

After further consultations, the tariff parts have also been completely agreed upon. It can be signed in the shortest amount of time.

<h3 id="e97">Mayor's Address <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Mayor Wu gave an address, saying: Director Wen, all police officers, soldiers, and gentlemen, our country is so vast and our people so numerous. What methods should we use to maintain the survival of the nation and its people, and to protect the order of peaceful life for the people? There are roughly two forces: one is military force and the other is law. The force of arms is the military, and the force of peace is the law. The military is used to resist foreign aggression. When foreign forces invade and coerce our nation, we use the power of the military to resist. Therefore, the duty of soldiers is to resist foreign aggression. However, in times of peace, we must use the power of the law to maintain the order of the country and society. Laws are dead letters; they cannot be executed on their own; they rely entirely on human effort. But who will execute the law? That is the responsibility of us police. Whether the police can shoulder this responsibility depends on their knowledge and ability. The world is advancing day by day, and society and human affairs are becoming increasingly complex. Therefore, the responsibility of the police is also becoming increasingly heavy. The knowledge and ability of the police must increase day by day with the world and society in order to cope with the advancing world and the complex society. Our country is still in the process of construction. In this process, every country is bound to experience great turmoil. This can be proven by history, both in China and abroad. This kind of turmoil is an inevitable stage for every country to go through from chaos to order, from weakness to strength. If we want to reduce this turmoil, we need the police even more. The police are an organization distributed throughout society and are in constant contact with the people. If the police are knowledgeable and capable, their greatest effectiveness is to eliminate, as much as possible, all dangers lurking in the deepest layers of society that are harmful to the society, the country, and the people, and to maintain the peace and order of society with the law and protect the safety of the region. Conversely, if the police organization is not strict, its knowledge is unsound, and its capabilities are too weak, it will certainly not be able to achieve this greatest effectiveness. We see that among the police across the country today, there are those who are unable to meet the expectations of the government and the people, all because their organization is not strict and their knowledge and abilities are shallow. Their greatest effectiveness is only to stop illegal and criminal behavior in society. Some are even unable to stop criminal activity after it has occurred. The greatest effectiveness of the police lies in eliminating all dangers before they occur. As a last resort, when danger erupts, they must be able to immediately stop it and reduce it, preventing it from expanding. If the effectiveness of the police is only to stop it after the fact, then such police are equivalent to being non-existent and are not the kind of police needed by the country, society, and the people. Take the January 28th Shanghai Incident last year, for example. At that time, there were many reactionaries and traitors who wanted to take advantage of the opportunity of the January 28th war and foreign forces to seize power, subvert the government, and endanger society and the country. Fortunately, the Shanghai police at that time were able to uncover and eliminate the organizations and institutions of traitors and reactionaries in advance, preventing them from harming the region and the country. This finally achieved a bit of the maximum effect of the police. The expenses and salaries of our police all come from the people's taxes. The people have the obligation to pay taxes, and at the same time, they have the right to demand that the government fully protect their lives and property. Since the expenses and salaries of our police come from the people, we must constantly reflect and examine the work we each do every day to see if it meets the expectations of the people. If we find that the work we do every day still does not meet the expectations of the people and there are shortcomings, we must always try our best to make up for our shortcomings and satisfy the people. This is the duty of you policemen. The government and the people expect so much and so urgently from our police, so we policemen must never fail them or fail in our duties, because the police are different from other officials. They are the officials closest to the people, distributed throughout society, and in daily contact with the people. Therefore, if they can fulfill their responsibilities, everyone will see it. If they fail in their duties, everyone will also see it. Doing good deeds will be praised by the people, and doing bad deeds will be criticized by the people. I have been a county magistrate and worked in the police force for several years. I believe that the work of all officials that can best win the attention and praise of society is that of the police and the county magistrate, because the police and the county magistrate are also the officials closest to the people. They have to deal directly with everything in society, and they must have sufficient knowledge and ability to deal with everything. Therefore, they can also improve their knowledge and ability the most while serving. As long as we policemen and county magistrates can be loyal to our duties, we will definitely increase a lot of knowledge and ability, and we will definitely be able to shoulder greater responsibilities in the future. Now you are all police officers or soldiers. This is not only a very honorable position, but also a good opportunity for you to demonstrate your knowledge and ability, and also to increase your knowledge and ability. Why do I say that being a police officer or soldier is very honorable? Because the duty of our police is to directly serve the people and society and seek the welfare of others. This is what I feel is very honorable and rare. Therefore, you must respect your own position, improve your character, and fully demonstrate your knowledge and ability, so that the people of society feel that they can sleep soundly when there are police. If you cannot do good things, you must not do bad things. This is the most important thing. Of course, it is very hopeful that you will do good things that benefit the country, society, and the people, not only fulfilling your duties but also allowing the people to enjoy welfare. The reason why we inspect the police every year is to inspect the knowledge and ability of the police, whether they can carry out their important tasks, and to let society know whether the effectiveness of the police is improving year by year. The past year or two has been the most dangerous and chaotic period in the history of Shanghai, and the Shanghai police have been relatively competent and generally good. However, we cannot be complacent about this, nor can we say that we can satisfy the expectations of society and the people. Therefore, we should work harder in the future to maintain the previous honor of the Shanghai police.</p>

<p>After Mayor Wu's address, Director Wen gave an address, saying roughly: Under Mayor Wu's constant guidance, the city's police administration has become increasingly substantial and police discipline has become increasingly thorough. Today, we are once again honored by Mayor Wu's personal inspection and address. All police officers and soldiers in the city should deeply engrave it in their minds and use it as a guide for our service at all times. Among Mayor Wu's addresses, what we must not forget is that the mission of the police is to maintain local security and protect the lives and property of citizens by law and with arms. Although the police and the military both belong to the armed forces, the military is for resisting foreign aggression, while the police are for maintaining local security according to the law.

<h3 id="e99">Signing a Contract for Sea-Land Intermodal Transport <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Shipments from the Northwest to Shanghai Will Become More Convenient / Intermodal Location is Laoyao Near Haizhou</p>
<p>The Longhai Railway is making concrete progress in developing transport in the Northwest, opening up Lianyungang, adding the new Xugou port, and implementing sea-land intermodal transport to develop Northwest traffic. The new port is currently under construction and will be fully completed next year. This year, the shipping industry on all routes has been sluggish, but the Haizhou route has been able to maintain itself without loss due to the increased export of goods from the Northwest. Ships sailing to Haizhou from Shanghai can all make a profit. The Longhai Railway Bureau recently sent personnel to Shanghai at the invitation of the China Merchants Bureau to sign a sea-land intermodal transport contract. The contract was signed yesterday afternoon. In the future, the sea transport of goods entering and leaving the Northwest, which are transferred by the Railway Bureau, will be handled exclusively by China Merchants. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e100">Current Merchant Ships <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>On the Shanghai-Haizhou route, the regular scheduled ships operating from Shanghai were originally the Yongping, Yongan, and Yongji of the Dazhen Shipping Company, and the Zhengzhou, Xuzhou, and Haizhou of the Nanshi Hezhong Shipping Company. The China Merchants Bureau originally sent the Tonghua ship to operate. These seven regular ships all go to Dapu Port to load goods. There are also 11 or 12 other irregular temporary cargo ships and salt-carrying ships each month. However, these "wild chicken" ships have no fixed routes or schedules and are not permanently within the Shanghai sea route. Only the seven ships of the three companies operate regularly and never change.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Establishing Intermodal Transport <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>The China Merchants Bureau, with its state-owned nature, has been promoting the shipping industry. This year, the Puan ship has been operating to Qingdao and has begun to sign an intermodal transport contract with the Jiaoji Railway. In recent months, the results have been very good and convenient for passengers. Now, it has further negotiated with the Longhai Railway to sign a sea-land intermodal transport contract. All goods transported from Shanghai to the Northwest and goods from the Northwest are transferred by the Longhai Railway. The sea transport of the Shanghai-Haizhou section is handled exclusively by the China Merchants Bureau. The two sides have been discussing this for a long time. Now, in order to implement it as soon as possible, the two parties have formally signed the revised draft intermodal transport contract.</p>
<h3 id="e102">One Year Trial <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>The Longhai Railway Bureau has decided to implement sea-land intermodal transport from October 1. All procedures have been completed. After the draft agreement was revised, it immediately commissioned Mr. Zhou, the person in charge of transport operations, to come to Shanghai. At 10:00 a.m. yesterday, he met with Liu Hongsheng at the China Merchants Bureau Headquarters and formally signed the sea-land intermodal transport contract. Each party holds one copy. Starting next month, the contract will be performed in accordance with the agreement. In the future, all goods transported by China Merchants Bureau ships to the Northwest will be transported by the Longhai Railway Bureau, and goods from the Northwest will be transferred to Shanghai by China Merchants Bureau ships. The trial period will last until the end of September next year. If both parties agree to renew the intermodal transport, a new agreement will be signed again.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Intermodal Location <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Haizhou Dapu was originally a port for merchant ships, but in recent years, it has become too silted up, and heavily loaded ships with deeper drafts often run aground. Therefore, the new Xugou port is being built. However, before the new port is completed, the Longhai Railway Bureau has established a temporary pier at Laoyao Seaport, 40 kilometers from Dapu, for the convenience of loading and unloading goods for intermodal transport. It has also built temporary warehouses and extended the Longhai Railway branch line to Laoyao, making it a temporary port for sea-land intermodal transport. Starting next month, China Merchants Bureau ships to Haizhou will go directly to Laoyao, which will avoid the obstruction of Dapu Seaport. In the future, goods from the Northwest can also be unloaded at Laoyao, which can moor large seagoing vessels and is not restricted by the port.</p>
<h3 id="e104">China Merchants Increases Ships <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>China Merchants originally sent one ship to the Haizhou route, either Tonghua or Jiahe, which was designated at any time from the two ships. Now that the intermodal transport contract has been signed, the import and export of goods from the Northwest will inevitably be more than it is now. The Bureau's business on the Haizhou route will also expand accordingly. The original dispatch of one ship is no longer sufficient. The Bureau is now considering increasing the number of seagoing vessels, and will temporarily transfer them after inspecting the situation on each route. It is estimated that at least one or two more ships will be needed to meet the demand. Before the new seagoing vessels being built arrive in Shanghai, they will generally be transferred from the North and South Ocean routes.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Shipping Companies Object <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>The China Merchants Bureau's signing of a sea-land intermodal transport contract with the Longhai Railway has been opposed by the Sanbei Company in this city. There are many Chinese merchant ships operating on the Haizhou route in Shanghai, and their cargo depends entirely on goods from the Northwest. Now that the Bureau monopolizes the advantages of intermodal transport, other merchant ships on the same route will have no goods to transport in the future. The Dazhen Hezhong and other companies have also expressed their opposition to this matter. However, the person in charge of the China Merchants Bureau said that the Bureau is a state-owned institution and seems to be different from commercially operated shipping companies. There are many precedents for intermodal transport in various countries, such as the South Manchuria Railway and Dalian Steamship Company, and the Japanese Post and the Ministry of Railways. There seems to be no reason for the opposition of the shipping companies.</p>
<p>Silk Industry Bonds Drawn for Redemption Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>A Total of Seven Branches Were Drawn to Redeem Principal of 110,000 / Redemption of Winning Bond Tickets Will Begin at the End of This Month</p>
<p>The fourth redemption drawing for the Short-Term Bonds of the Jiangzhe Silk Industry of the Republic of China Year 22 was held at 10:00 a.m. yesterday at the Bank Association on Hong Kong Road. More than 30 representatives from all walks of life attended. The chairman of the Fund Custody Committee, Qin Runqing, drew seven branches, redeeming a total of 110,000 in principal. The winning bond tickets are scheduled to be redeemed by the Central, China, Communications, National Products, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang Local Banks starting on the 30th of this month. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e106">Attending Representatives <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>

<p>After performing the rituals, Chairman Qin Runqing reported, saying roughly, "Today is the date for the fourth redemption drawing of these bonds. I am very pleased to have you all attend to supervise and observe. The total amount of these bonds issued was 3 million. In addition to the three previous drawings, seven branches should be drawn this time, totaling 210,000 in principal. Starting on the 30th of this month, those who hold the fourth winning numbers of these bonds will be paid in cash by the Central, China, Communications, National Products, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang Local Banks.

The meeting adjourned at 11:00 a.m.</p>
<p>The Times Comments</p>
<h3 id="e109">Telephone Company's Price Increase Cannot be Increased Before the End of the Three Years / Must Present Solid Evidence <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times commented yesterday on the Shanghai Telephone Company's application to the authorities of the two concessions for a price increase, saying roughly, "The public seems to be unaware that when the authorities of the two concessions signed a contract with the Telephone Company in 1930, granting it exclusive operating rights, it was stipulated that the original prices would continue to be charged until the complete conversion to automatic telephones. Within three years after the complete conversion (i.e., until March 1935), prices would be charged according to the construction prices specified in the Anthon report. After the three-year period, the telephone rates would be revised according to the operating conditions, so that the company's invested capital could obtain a 10% interest rate. The Municipal Council must be well aware of this provision. We do not understand why the Municipal Council did not inform the company of the contract terms when it applied for a price increase, urging it to wait a little longer and not rush. Now that this matter has been submitted to the Public Utilities Committee for consideration, this provision must be pointed out more solemnly. The amount of the increase and the date of implementation requested by the company have not yet been announced, but one point must be raised on behalf of the public: the Municipal Council, as the protector of the public, should not lightly grant the increase unless the company can present full accounts proving that it will face permanent financial difficulties within the remaining 30 years of the exclusive operating period if the price is not increased immediately. We still remember that when the company increased prices last year in accordance with the contract, it aroused opposition and indignation from the citizens. Moreover, it is worth noting that when the Chinese side recently requested the cancellation of the five-cent Chinese-foreign call fee, the company believed that since there was a contract, it must be observed and not changed unilaterally. Otherwise, what would be the benefit of signing contracts in the future? This principle of observing contracts should also be applicable to the provisions on telephone rates. The main purpose of the Anthon investigation report was to protect the public interest and stipulate a five-year trial period to observe the company's financial situation. Now that the trial period is only 18 months away, will the prices stipulated in the contract cause such a large loss that it cannot wait a moment and must be remedied immediately? Now, after 1935, the company still has 35 years of exclusive operating rights to collect the due remuneration. As for the telephone rates for users, they have already been increased once. If the stipulated three-year period has not yet expired, and it wants to increase them a second time, is that not an unfair way? Although we are not saying that the company's reasons should not be given a fair hearing at present, we believe that there must be solid evidence to prove that the company will face irreparable financial difficulties if the contract is not allowed to be changed before it can be allowed to increase prices."</p>
<p>Fessenden Visited Yu Hongjun Yesterday</p>
<h3 id="e110">Factory Inspection Involves Chinese Sovereignty / The Municipal Council Warns Factories Must Be Cautious / Therefore, the Meeting Yesterday Resulted in No Progress <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Fessenden, Director-General of the Public Concession Municipal Council, visited Secretary-General Yu Hongjun of the Municipal Government at 11:00 a.m. yesterday to continue discussions on the issue of factory inspections in the concession. There were disputes over the issue of sovereignty over the jurisdiction of the inspection team. Yu also advised the Municipal Council not to arbitrarily warn Chinese factories in the concession. The two discussed for an hour. The content is as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e111">Jurisdiction of the Inspection Team <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Fessenden visited Yu and first said that the Municipal Council Board of Directors could express its approval of the measures proposed by the two for the negotiation results, but the issue of jurisdiction after the inspection team was organized should be discussed. The Municipal Council intends to follow the measures for stamp taxes on tobacco and alcohol in the concession, with the Municipal Council managing on behalf. After hearing this, Yu replied reasonably, saying, "The right to inspect factories in the concession belongs to the Chinese government. However, the Chinese government, for the sake of the welfare of workers, ordered me to negotiate with the Municipal Council for handling, not hesitating to compromise in every way. Each side sent personnel to form an inspection team. Our side has already made many concessions. If there are opinions and disputes among the inspectors, the two secretaries-general can impartially adjudicate them. According to the Municipal Council's claim, it concerns our sovereignty and is not possible to negotiate," etc. It is heard that our side upholds the established principle and will never lose sovereignty. Fessenden still has to take orders from the Board of Directors. The measures agreed upon by the two sides previously have no possibility of proceeding.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Caution in Warning Factories <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Yu also expressed his views to Fessenden regarding the Municipal Council's recent arbitrary warnings to Chinese factories in the concession, saying, "The Municipal Government, for the sake of the welfare of workers and to eliminate public danger, sympathizes with the Municipal Council's warnings to factories. However, the right to manage factories in the concession belongs to our side. The meaning of Article 34 of the Annex to the Yangjingbang Regulations is very narrow, limited only to the Municipal Council's ability to ban dangerous buildings. The Municipal Council should not use this as a basis to arbitrarily warn Chinese factories in the concession. It is hoped that this will be handled cautiously in the future." Fessenden expressed his agreement to consider this point and handle it carefully in the future, and then excused himself and left.</p>

<p>After the young aviator Sun Tonggang returned to China by flying a monoplane from Germany, he made the great feat of circumnavigating the country, and his whereabouts have been warmly welcomed by the people in various places. Shanghai gentleman Du Yuesheng, in view of the fact that such talents are rare in our country, and in order to promote aviation to save the country and encourage aviation talents, specially ordered an airplane from abroad and donated it to Sun, so that Sun can work harder in the future. Mr. Du has been leading the masses and serving the society for many years, and his hard work is remarkable. This time, he uniquely donated an airplane to Sun, and his patriotic enthusiasm is beyond the reach of ordinary armchair strategists.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Liaison Office of the Third Route Commander of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army received an order from Commander Wang from Dongbeigou, Rehe West, yesterday, and a letter to Mayor Wu. The letter is as follows: "Sir, since the September 18th Incident, the troops of our Route have been engaged in anti-Japanese work, fighting bloody battles for many years and sacrificing greatly. They are still stationed in the Rehe West area, participating in the recovery of lost territory. Because news from the rear is often blocked, liaison offices have been established in Beiping, Guangzhou, Nanjing, and Shanghai to facilitate matters. This has been reported to the General Commander of our Army, Zhu Zhaozhun, for approval. However, according to a report from the Shanghai Liaison Office, there are now lawless elements, falsely claiming the name of our Route, swaggering and deceiving people everywhere, and even impersonating the echelon commander of our Route. This is shocking. Our Route only has the First and Second Columns, and there is no echelon system. Moreover, all levels of military officers of our Route are working with the General Commander of our Army at the front. How can anyone dare to impersonate? Obviously, there are other motives, seeking donations for profit. Such behavior is a serious violation of the law, and it damages the reputation of our Route and insults the personality of the Righteous Army. It is even more outrageous. In addition to ordering the Shanghai Liaison Office to immediately publish a notice in the newspaper, not to be deceived, we also ordered them to submit a letter to you, requesting your Municipal Government to investigate and arrest these lawless elements strictly, in order to deter lawlessness and maintain the reputation of the army. This is a public convenience. Correspondingly, we send this letter, requesting your attention and implementation. Respectfully, [addressed to] Mayor Wu of the Shanghai Municipal Government, Wang Gongwei, Commander of the Third Route of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army, September 18th."</p>
<h3 id="e116">Disasters Reported Everywhere / Baoshan <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Changxingsha and other areas belonging to Baoshan County, isolated at sea, were suddenly hit by a typhoon on the 2nd of this month, suffering extremely heavy damage. The Baoshan County Government convened a joint meeting of various agencies, and the Property Management Office first raised 1,000 yuan to purchase supplies and dispatched personnel to distribute emergency relief. At the same time, the Provincial Government was telegraphed to allocate funds for relief. Unexpectedly, less than half a month later, on the night of September 18, the typhoon struck again. The wind rode the tide, and the tide rode the wind, with the water level two or three feet higher than on September 2. People and animals drifted away, forming an unprecedented disaster. The sand people had no place to live and lacked clothing and food, and they flocked across the sea to the city to request relief. The County Government, supervised by the First District Office, took them in and provided them with supplies. However, the various agencies of the County, since the January 28th war, have been in dire financial straits. The previous request for relief from the Province has not been addressed. This time, the disaster is even worse, and relief cannot be delayed. The County Government convened another meeting and decided that, in addition to telegraphing the Provincial Government again for relief, Gu's Mansion would also prepare a letter and send personnel to discuss with various charitable organizations for maximum assistance. Yan Guangen, Zhou Zhizhen, Jiang Hongbin, Zhu Yiyi, and other gentlemen were appointed as representatives to contact the Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Relief Society, the Shanghai Jisheng Society, Renjitang, the Chinese Red Cross Society, the Shanghai Red Swastika Society, and other organizations to request assistance. It is heard that the various charitable organizations are working to provide relief.</p>

<p>The Chinese Jisheng Society recently received a telegram from Jia Rida, the County Magistrate and Disaster Relief Committee of Nanhui County, stating, "Our County suffered a typhoon disaster on the 1st and 2nd of this month, and we telegraphed for allocation of funds to relieve the disaster victims on the *th of this month. We are currently rushing to repair the sea dikes, and the pear wind suddenly brought rain, intensifying at night, uprooting trees and collapsing houses, layer upon layer. The wind is more violent than the last time. The urban area is like this, and the disaster situation along the coast is unimaginable. By Haoshang morning, the wind had subsided slightly, but the rain had not stopped. We urgently appeal, begging you to quickly raise funds for relief, to have pity on the disaster victims," etc. According to reports, the Society is providing relief to the disaster-stricken areas of Baoshan Wusong, the sandbanks of the Yangtze River, and the islands of Chuansha. The second typhoon and heavy rain have arrived, and the disaster situation has doubled. The lives, livestock, property, and other losses of the people are incalculable. The disaster areas of Qidong, Nanhui, Haimen, and other places are even more tragic. How can we compare them to the Henan flood and the East Yellow River water disaster? The Society is currently discussing with the Ten Charity Groups to solicit donations and record names, in the hope of saving more disaster victims and establishing good relationships. It is hoped that saving lives is not just benefiting one province or one county, but creating endless blessings.</p>

<p>The Zhenhai Embankment Works Bureau sent a telegram to the Ningbo Fellow-Townsmen Association in Shanghai, addressed to all gentlemen of the Ningbo community in Shanghai: Our county experienced fierce winds and torrential rains on the night of the 18th of this month, with a sudden surge in the tide, turning both the city and the countryside into a watery expanse. The ferocity of the disaster surpasses even the floods and typhoons of the Republic of China Year 20, constituting a massive calamity unseen in a century. Among the most pressing concerns requiring urgent repair is the Wan Gong Embankment, the protective barrier for the six counties along the rear sea. Investigations reveal that the embankment, previously repaired after sections were damaged through fundraising, has suffered further damage. The tide exceeded the embankment by three to four feet. Not only have the unrepaired sections deteriorated, but the newly repaired sections have also been battered and shattered by the wind and tides. After thorough inspection by Hou Pei and others, it is estimated that approximately 1,600 zhang of the stone embankment, stretching from Jinzi Mountain to Yu Fan Road, has sustained damage, with about 200 zhang severely affected, rendering the entire embankment in a precarious state. We plan to prioritize urgent repairs to prevent unforeseen circumstances. The estimated cost of the project is around thirty to forty thousand yuan. In addition to reporting the disaster to the county government, we are sending this telegram in advance. Further details will be provided in a subsequent letter. Respectfully, Li Houpei, Director of the Zhenhai County Embankment Works Bureau, Jiang Yichang, Deputy Director, and others.</p>

<p>The Seventh District of Yin County sent a telegram to the Ningbo Fellow-Townsmen Association in Shanghai, addressed to all gentlemen of the Ningdu Shanghai Fellow-Townsmen Association: Fierce winds and torrential rains struck here on the afternoon of the 17th of this month, ceasing only on the morning of the 19th. The mountains and rivers along the Yin River overflowed, turning the area into a watery expanse. Fields and villages were submerged, and livestock were swept away. The autumn harvest is now hopeless. Roads, embankments, and weirs have been largely destroyed. All utility poles have been snapped, cutting off transportation. Countless houses and appliances have been collapsed by the flood. Overall, the severity of this disaster and the magnitude of the losses are comparable to those of the Republic of China Year 10. Although the floodwaters have receded, the disaster has already occurred. A chorus of cries for help awaits assistance. Apart from the accurate figures for losses, which will be gathered and reported later, we are sending this telegram to request your esteemed association to consider our shared native-place ties and devise appropriate relief measures. The fellow townsmen would be immensely grateful. This urgent telegram conveys our pressing need for assistance. Mao Dushi, District Head of the Seventh District of Yin County.</p>

<p>The China Foreign Famine Relief Committee reported that it received a representative from the South Hebei Huanghe (Yellow River) Relief Committee of Changyuan County, Hebei Province, Han Zhensheng, who provided a face-to-face account of the disaster in Changyuan County, Hebei Province. A record of this situation is provided below: (1) The volume of the Yellow River this year is unprecedented in history. On August 11th, both banks of the river in Changyuan County breached simultaneously for more than forty miles. On the west bank, from the Third to the Fifth District, there were thirty-two breaches along approximately thirty miles. There were also multiple breaches on the east bank. (2) The water's force was fierce. When the levees first breached, the water level was between one to two zhang high in some places and several feet high in others. In an instant, the entire county was submerged, turning over 800 villages into a watery expanse. Fortunately, most people were able to escape. (3) The flooded area covers over 800 villages and over 14,000 qing of farmland. (4) The affected population is over 300,000, with approximately four to five percent drowned. (5) Floating grains, along with stored grains in warehouses, were completely swept away, with losses estimated at over 15 million yuan. (6) Drowned livestock: The total number of livestock in the county is estimated at over 70,000. Approximately 70% of these animals have been drowned, drifted away, or starved to death, with losses estimated at 800,000 head. (7) Clothing, farming tools, etc., that were washed away are valued at several million yuan. (8) Collapsed houses: There are approximately 600,000 houses in the entire county, with approximately 500,000 of them collapsed by the water. The loss is valued at approximately 1 million yuan. (9) Altered land: The land near the river was known for its fertility, with each mu worth up to 100 yuan. However, the Yellow River's waters have inundated and silted these lands, transforming them into sand-blown fields, accounting for about one-third of the county's land. This is a permanent change, and the extent of the loss cannot be estimated. (10) The livelihoods of the disaster victims: Most are currently taking refuge on high ground or in collapsed and dilapidated houses, often exposed to the elements. They endure scorching sun and chilling winds while excavating spoiled grain and gathering bridge railings to fill their stomachs. Most tragically, heavy rains have followed the flood. Some use mats as shelters or build grass huts, while others are simply exposed to the rain. Some go without fire for one or two days, their cries of hunger and cold bringing tears to the eyes and piercing the heart. The wretchedness and sorrow of their plight are unbearable to describe fully. In summary, the magnitude of the losses from the Changyuan County flood is immense. Apart from the inestimable cost of fertile land transformed into sand-blown fields, the losses are estimated at approximately 25 million yuan. The number of people killed or injured is estimated to be in the tens of thousands, while 300,000 disaster victims are without shelter, clothing, or food. Their movements are restricted by the danger of silted beaches and deep waters. Even after the Yellow River recedes, the opportunity to sow wheat will be limited by a lack of seeds. Exposed to the scorching sun and wind and rain, eating rotten grain and drinking foul water, a major epidemic is inevitable. It is feared that the 300,000 people will not only die from hunger and cold but also from the epidemic. These wailing souls urgently need help.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Shanghai Red Cross Relief Team Headed North Yesterday <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>In light of the severe Yellow River flood disaster, the Shanghai Red Cross Society, through the efforts of various philanthropists such as Zhang Qianmiao, He Qianren, Qi Minlin, and Huang Jiwu, has collected 20,000 yuan in relief funds. Qi Minlin and Zhao Lin were publicly elected to lead a team, including member He Hongyu and laborers, to Jinan to make arrangements. Mr. Qi left for the north by the express train last night. The presidents of the society and various philanthropists saw them off at the station. Before departing, Messrs. Qi and Zhao declared to those seeing them off that their trip would adhere to the principle of charitable relief, saving the dying without helping the poor. They would handle urgent relief efforts, not accept local supplies or official receptions, and all operations would be coordinated with the Jinan Red Cross Society.</p>

<h3 id="e123">The General Chamber of Commerce Strongly Advocates Taxing Foreign Rice and Rejects a Letter from Cai Xuetian of Shantou <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce rejected a letter from Cai Xuetian of the Shantou Overseas Chinese Daily opposing the Federation's proposal to tax foreign rice. The Federation has sent another letter in response. The original letters are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e124">Cai's Letter <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>To all Executive Directors of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce: I have received your detailed response regarding the matter of levying import duties on foreign rice. Your earnest and sincere intentions are deeply appreciated. Taxing foreign rice affects the people's food supply, and even village elders and children are directly and personally affected. This is an extraordinary measure, and I find myself unable to fully agree with many points in your letter. Thinking of the disaster victims, my heart trembles and my conscience is uneasy. I cannot blindly follow your proposal. I will list my views and hope to learn from your guidance: (1) For over a decade, our country's food imports have been increasing year by year. The statistics from the customs office clearly show that your argument that our country has insufficient food supplies, claiming it may only be in lean years, is not supported by the facts and cannot be used as a basis for proposing this measure. (2) The Chinese people have all experienced the hardship of food shortages. Their lives are below the poverty line, and over 90% are living between life and death. To provide relief, it should not be limited to rice-producing areas (as mentioned in your letter). Taxing foreign rice will burden the rice-consuming population. Even if it increases the price of domestic rice, those who benefit from the higher prices will still be the same suffering people. Every action taken only increases the government's tax revenue and adds to the people's economic hardship. Where is the benefit? (3) The main reason for importing foreign rice is the insufficient domestic food supply. This can be clearly seen in the statistics. Even with heavy taxes, people cannot survive on air. The supply and demand situation remains unchanged. To increase the government's revenue by taxing foreign rice is insufficient to prevent the dumping of foreign rice. (4) The use of tariff barriers is a weapon for protecting production, and there are many examples. However, has China's hard-won tariff autonomy benefited domestic products at all besides providing revenue for the central government? There are numerous ways to collect taxes besides tariffs. Do you think my concern that this bad precedent will lead to taxes on domestic grains is excessive? Please consider the facts and the past events after gaining tariff autonomy, and you will surely stop. (5) The Chinese people have suffered greatly from unified taxes. The consequences are unbearable. During the Hong Yang Rebellion, officials, troubled by military expenses, created the Likin system. This mistake has caused the entire Chinese population to suffer under harsh taxes for over a century. They have endured countless cries, endless humiliation, and countless difficulties. Thanks to foreign intervention, it was finally abolished, but some measures that harm the people remain to compensate for the tax. The beginning may be small, but the cruelty is unparalleled and the long-term impact is worse than massacre. These are lessons that you should learn from. Thinking of the endless harm, I am concerned. (6) Your letter also states that the foreign rice tax will only slightly affect the people of one or two provinces, while benefiting the entire country. So you admit that one or two provinces will be affected. How many people in the country rely on rice for a living? How many people have enough rice to feed themselves, and how many need to buy rice? How different are the gains and losses? What are the trade-offs? You are all respected figures. If you are not fully aware of the situation, how can you make decisions? The way of governing is to be fair. Even if it is only one or two provinces (referring to Fujian and Guangdong), these provinces have over 50 million people, and the impact is huge. Shouldn't there be ways to compensate before taking such drastic measures? (7) The world's economy is heading towards bankruptcy, and our poor country is suffering even more. Prices have been falling in recent years, and although not uniformly, everything is trending downwards. People are already struggling to make ends meet and are facing starvation. Now, you are raising the price of rice, a necessity for survival. A small number of people in rice-producing areas may benefit, but it will be too much for the entire population. (8) There have been reports of taxes on domestic rice. The heavy taxes and fees on farmland are too numerous to name, even for officials. In recent years, government systems have been changing, and local organizations have been expanding, increasing expenses. These expenses are covered by taxes on people and land, which are indirectly levied on agricultural products. Agricultural production has not been addressed, and cultivation methods remain outdated. The cost is high, and the output is low, which is why it cannot compete with foreign rice. Your plan to provide relief is not addressing the root cause. It is merely a temporary solution and not a way to benefit the country and the people. The above eight points are either established facts or verifiable reasons that cannot be concealed or denied. If the government is sincere in helping rice-producing farmers, it should focus on reducing the burden on farmers, lowering agricultural production costs, developing production areas, and increasing production with national support. By using incentives for production and subsidies for sales, the goal of food self-sufficiency can be achieved. If the entire country works together, foreign rice will disappear without taxes. Your association is a group of businessmen, and you are all well-known figures. If you can find a fair and just way to provide relief, the entire country will respond, and future generations will benefit. I hope you will consider this. Sincerely, Cai Xuetian.</p>
<h3 id="e125">The Chamber of Commerce's Reply <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>In response to your previous letter discussing the tax on foreign rice, we have received another letter discussing eight points, insisting that our country has insufficient domestic rice and must rely on foreign rice. You worry that Fujian and Guangdong will become disaster areas after the foreign rice tax and that this bad precedent will lead to taxes on domestic grains. We admire your kindness and foresight. However, our association is considering the entire country and the majority of the people. Therefore, we propose a heavy tariff on foreign rice to treat the symptoms and reduce the cost of domestic rice to treat the root cause. Since we submitted the proposal to the central government, the response from various provincial governments and the support from public opinion, except for foreign rice merchants, has been almost unanimous, indicating that our association's proposal is not wrong. We will reply to your points as follows: (1) We cannot conclude that our country has insufficient food based solely on customs statistics on grain imports. Although there are no precise statistics on the total grain production in our country, we can estimate it. Most provinces north of the Yangtze River eat wheat. After a bumper harvest last year, many people switched from wheat to rice due to the sharp drop in rice prices, resulting in a larger purchase of wheat than rice. This has already been seen in the reports of the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Railways. Guizhou, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Sichuan may have deficits or surpluses that can be supplemented. The remaining provinces, including Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu, are all rice-surplus areas. The provinces with a rice deficit are Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong. Zhejiang has a small deficit. According to the declaration of rice merchants in Guangdong last year, about 10 million dan of foreign rice are imported each year. Although there are no statistics for Fujian, it should not exceed the amount of Guangdong. The surplus of six provinces can cover the deficit of three provinces. Even if the deficit is as you said, it should not be much. Moreover, grain prices have been falling in recent years, and farmers have switched to other crops because the harvest cannot cover the cost of labor and fertilizer. If grain prices rise, they will return to the original state, and the production will increase year by year. Furthermore, if our country has a grain shortage, grain prices should have risen first. However, the price of imported grain has fallen, which clearly shows that other countries are dumping surplus grain in our country. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the import of grain through customs meets the needs of our country. (2) Our country is an agricultural country, and farmers should be more numerous than any other profession. If, as you said, (90% are living between life and death,) our association believes that farmers should account for more than 90% of this 90%. To weigh the importance, we should sacrifice 10% to save 90%. Moreover, this 10% may not be sincerely sacrificing themselves. (3) This is due to the subjective error in the first point. Based solely on the statistics of foreign rice imports, you conclude that there is insufficient domestic grain and that people will eat air after the foreign rice tax. This is an overestimation. Did people start eating air after taxes were levied on cloth? (4) Our country has fought for a long time to regain tariff autonomy. The government has just gotten rid of the shackles and has not had time to implement measures. However, the determination of which tax rates should be high and which should be low is to promote domestic production through tariffs. This is very different from being slaughtered before regaining autonomy. Recently, the Ministry of Industry is discussing protective tariffs. This is a good understanding of the government. The fact is that your statement that (besides providing revenue for the central government, has there been any benefit to domestic products?) is far from the truth. The so-called bad precedent that will lead to taxes on domestic grains is an obvious overestimation. Our country is an agricultural country, and agriculture is the foundation of the country. The decline of rural areas means the foundation of the country is shaking. The central government has also paid attention to this. For example, it has explicitly exempted transit taxes and rice inspection fees, and the Ministry of Transportation has reduced freight rates. The Ministry of Industry has sent personnel to investigate and find ways to provide relief. These facts can prove that the central government's actions are the opposite of what you said. (5) The harm of Likin is undeniable. However, it was only used for military expenses at the time. By the Republic of China, it had been listed as national expenditure. If it were abolished, the national expenditure would be insufficient, and we would have to collect business taxes and unified taxes as a transitional compensation. However, whether the unified tax rate is harmful to the people or not will be proven by the facts. Taxing foreign rice has the meaning of providing relief to rural areas and should not be confused with it. (6) The number of people who eat rice cannot be statistically determined, but farmers are more numerous than other people. No one would deny this. The oversupply of domestic grain has been mentioned above, so the number of sellers should be greater than the number of buyers. The so-called impact on one or two provinces is only temporary and they will only eat slightly more expensive rice. This is the same as other foreign goods and will not lead to disaster areas or disaster victims. (7) Your statement that (everything is trending downwards) is true. The trade in cities relies on customers in counties and towns, and the shops in counties and towns rely on customers in rural areas. Now that rural areas are bankrupt, farmers cannot afford to buy goods, and goods in counties and towns are stagnant and cannot be circulated. Cities are also in recession and can only sell at a loss. This downward trend is not a real decrease in the price of goods. It is that farmers' rice is suppressed by the dumping of foreign rice and cannot be sold, resulting in a lack of purchasing power. Therefore, helping rural areas is to help industry and commerce and to bring society to a stable state. If we let it go, farmers will have no way to sell their rice, so they will have nothing to trade, and they will have to stop farming. Taxing foreign rice is a temporary solution, but our association has also requested the abolition of domestic rice taxes and all harsh and new taxes that harm the people as a way to address the root cause. Moreover, rice inspection fees and transit taxes have already been explicitly exempted, and freight rates have also been reduced. The cost of domestic rice has been reduced a lot. If the foreign rice tax is implemented and announced, the intention to indirectly encourage it can be seen. By doing both, the sales of domestic rice will be guaranteed. In short, if Chinese people eat domestic rice, even if the price is higher, the benefits will remain within the country. If Chinese people eat foreign rice, even if the price is lower, the money will flow out of the country. This is the purpose of economic nationalism, and we will not hesitate to use it. We have always admired you as a knowledgeable leader in Lingnan who has studied rural economics. I hope you will not find this long reply tedious. Please review it and provide guidance. Sincerely, The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce of the Republic of China, September 23, 22nd year of the Republic of China.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Reduction of Land Transfer Tax <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>The municipal land value tax has been levied on schedule, and the land transfer tax within the area has also been changed to 2%. It is learned that after the measure was announced by the municipal government, it has been implemented. The land transfer tax was originally levied at 8%, but now it has been changed to 2% due to the collection of land value tax, which is a significant reduction of 60%. Owners in parts of Shanghai South, Zhabei, Yangjing, Pujiang, and Songhuafahua who have land transfers can pay taxes according to the newly set tax rate.</p>
<h3 id="e127">The County Public Funds and Property Office Requests Abolition of Perpetual Tenancy Tax <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Public Funds and Property Management Office, etc., sent a telegram to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance, stating: "On the 8th of this month, Shanghai newspapers reported that the Jiangsu Provincial Government's 594th meeting resolved to levy a perpetual tenancy tax. The public is shocked and says that at a time when the rural economy is heading towards bankruptcy, the provincial government has such a harsh tax for the poor farmers. If this is implemented, the people cannot survive. We should appeal to the central government because the people of Jiangsu are in distress." Yun Shen and others have witnessed the suffering of the people and the strict urging of the elders. We are combining the reasons for the abolition and daring to present them to your Yuan and Ministry. According to the regulations on the promulgation of donation tax regulations, issued by the National Government's Order No. 91 in September of the 20th year of the Republic of China, the establishment of donation taxes must be decided in principle by the Central Political Council and resolved by the Legislative Yuan to be effective. Article 10 of this Perpetual Tenancy Tax Ordinance states that "This Ordinance shall be implemented upon resolution and promulgation by the Jiangsu Provincial Government Committee," which seems to be inconsistent with the procedures stipulated by the government. This is one reason why we must request its abolition. According to this rule, the land transfer tax regulations do not distinguish between the land base and the land interest. The sale deed is taxed at 9%, and the mortgage deed is taxed at 6%. The amount of tax is determined by the distinction between sale and mortgage. The land surface mortgage deed has already been taxed, so the land surface sale deed is another matter. According to the explanation of perpetual tenancy rights, it is the right to use the land permanently, and there is no expiration date for redemption in the contract, which is the same as the current sale deed tax. Now, we want to cleverly avoid the name of the sale deed and implement a double tax system. We believe that the Jiangsu Provincial Government will not be willing to deceive the farmers with profound and distorted interpretations. This is the second reason why we must request its abolition. In recent years, the country has been in trouble, and the landscape is full of scars. We are calling for relief to rural areas. Now, floods and droughts have occurred, and the years are not good. The grain is cheap and hurts farmers. We should consider the foundation of the country, reduce the burden, and relieve the people from weakness. The people of Jiangsu are poor and have exhausted their resources. It is difficult to collect all the regular taxes that have been levied over the years. Now, we are imposing harsh taxes on the dying poor farmers. Even if we strip the marrow and knock the fat, there is no end to the number. This is the third reason why we must request its abolition. Yun Shen and others are heartbroken and have said everything. Although it seems like a warning from a pessimist, it is actually a request for the people. We are telegraphically requesting that your Yuan and Ministry consider the suffering of the people's livelihood, approve the abolition of this ordinance to stabilize agriculture and comfort the people's hearts, and be deeply grateful. Huang Yun Shen, Director of the Shanghai Public Funds and Property Office, Kang Yongnian, Deputy Director, and Wu Shifang, Ding Jicheng, Sun Shiben, Fu Dianying, Xing Zhigang, Wang Chengyao, and others, the six district heads of Shanghai County, respectfully ask for your consideration.</p>

<p>Concerning the Yungang Grottoes in Datong, Shanxi Province, the China Archaeological Society's Cai Yuanpei, Ye Gongchuo, Liu Haisu, and others previously reported that the stone carvings were damaged by Commander Zhao Chengshou's troops. They specifically telegraphed Yan Xishan, requesting strict orders to protect and restore them. Now Cai et al. have received Yan Xishan's response telegram, stating that he has already dispatched personnel for on-site inspection and that there were no recent signs of damage. The original telegram is as follows: To Mr. Cai Jiemin, Ye Yuhu, Liu Haisu, and other gentlemen of the China Archaeological Society: The telegrams of concern have been received. Now, according to the report from the dispatched personnel, an inspection of the stone carvings inside and outside the caves of the Yungang Temple revealed no recent signs of damage. The Yungang Villa, located on the east side of the temple, consists of ten rooms and one pavilion. The current construction of the surrounding wall involves quarrying stones from the foot of the mountain opposite the west side of the temple and does not damage the stone carvings. According to Commander Zhao, due to the fame of Yungang, many Chinese and foreign tourists have visited in recent years. They all consider the temple's dilapidation and narrowness, with no place to rest, a drawback. Ambassador Yan visited two years ago and initiated the construction of a hostel for this reason. Therefore, several rooms were built and a road for motor vehicles was constructed, originally to protect the historical site and facilitate tourism, how could it be to add damage? The report has already sent a letter requesting correction, etc. After investigation, the situation described is indeed the actual situation, etc. This special telegram is respectfully delivered to Yan Xishan.</p>
<p>Reversal of fortune leads to defeat; Mount Emei faces dire straits again.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Huge sums of money wasted on a futile project; temporary success turns fleeting; The Emei must be towed back to Shanghai by April next year. <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>The Emei steamer of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company ran aground in Fuzhou. Over two months, the company spent a huge sum of eighty to ninety thousand yuan, employing a large number of workers and expending great effort. It was only the day before yesterday that the ship's hull was refloated. The Chongqing branch telegraphed Shanghai, reporting that the salvage was successful and that the ship could be towed back to Shanghai immediately. The company was delighted upon receiving the news and decided to use the ship, after repairs, to launch an express service on the Beijing-Hankou route. This matter was detailed in this newspaper on the 21st of this month. However, yesterday morning, the Chongqing branch sent another urgent telegram stating that the Emei had been salvaged but suddenly encountered receding water, causing the ship's hull to become trapped in a dangerous situation again. This year, it is impossible to salvage. The completed work was defeated in an instant, with huge sums of money wasted. The company was extremely distressed. Upon receiving this alarming news, it was as if struck by lightning. It has now ordered the captain to return quickly and consider other solutions. The situation is reported again as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e132">Sudden Retreat of River Water Causes Ship to Become Trapped Again <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Emei--Eight weeks of labor wasted,</p>
<p>Nine thousand yuan spent to lift the front half of the ship from the chaotic reefs using the rising water and two small wheels. After repairing the broken hole, it was thought that the salvage was a success. Therefore, the machinery and radio equipment removed from the ship were reinstalled. Shen Jiyun even telegraphed General Manager Liu to say it can be salvaged immediately and come to Shanghai, and the company has prepared for the repair and reconstruction of the Beijing-Hankou new route. Unexpectedly, yesterday morning, the Chongqing branch suddenly sent an urgent telegram stating that the water level of the upper reaches of the Yangtze River had suddenly and drastically receded on the 21st, dropping by more than ten feet compared to a few days ago. This caused the already salvaged Emei steamer to be stranded again on the rocky shore, far from the center of the river, making it impossible to tow it into the water. The effort of nine years was ruined in an instant. The sudden retreat of the river water was unexpected and beyond human control. According to this situation, there is no hope of rising water this year and must wait until the river rises next spring before it can be salvaged again. Huge sums of money are wasted, and efforts are in vain. The unexpected change of events is such that the company has been greatly distressed to receive this telegram. It can only postpone the decided dock repair and the opening of a new route, and meanwhile submit a report to the Ministry for review.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Withdrawal of Crew and Termination of Salvage Operations <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>The re-entrapment of the Emei on the high bank was beyond everyone's expectations. Even the personnel in charge of the matter did not expect it. Although the ship's hull cannot be brought into the river now, the broken holes have already been repaired. It can only wait until April next spring to tow it to Shanghai. The company has telegraphed Deputy Captain Shen Jiyun, who was sent to rescue, ordering him to quickly end the salvage operations and return to Shanghai with Captain Ji Qingrong and the crew. Only a few people will be left on board to maintain the fire and keep watch. Meanwhile, a telegram will be sent from the company to the Ministry, requesting special orders to local military and police and to inform the Naval Department to notify the Yangtze River Fleet to protect the ship at all times, to prevent damage to the ship's machinery and theft of items on board.</p>

<p>And an apology to the startled visitors.</p>
<p>The Municipal Zoo sent a letter to this newspaper yesterday, stating: "Dear Sir, We have read the news in your esteemed newspaper about a large bear escaping from its cage. The editor of the Morning Post also discussed in ('Spare Time Chat') how the great bear escaped. To clarify the facts and dispel doubts, our zoo hereby reports the following: During the period of security for our zoo, it was originally planned to build four sturdy animal houses for lions, tigers, bears, and leopards, and to raise them separately. However, due to budget constraints in the municipal treasury, only two houses were built. In addition to placing the more ferocious lions and tigers in them, a leopard, which is smaller in size but quite ferocious, was kept in the small iron shed that used to house the tigers. As for a large bear, because it was purchased from a performer and is generally docile and without teeth, it was temporarily kept in the small animal house before the large animal houses were added. Unexpectedly, yesterday morning, the bear actually used force to destroy the iron nail caps on the shed door, escaping from the door. The incident was extraordinary, and there was no time to prevent it, causing alarm to the visitors, for which we sincerely apologize. Fortunately, no one was injured, and it was immediately intercepted and returned to the shed. In addition to reporting the facts to the Municipal Education Bureau and requesting that they be forwarded to the Municipal Government to allocate funds to add large animal houses as soon as possible, so as to facilitate relocation and prevent future troubles, we are specifically reporting the facts by letter to clarify the truth and dispel doubts, and to express our apologies to the startled visitors. We respectfully request that you disclose this letter. Yours sincerely, Shanghai Municipal Zoo, September 23rd."</p>

<p>Shanghai Times reports that on Tuesday night, over a hundred of the two hundred members of the White Russian detachment of the Shanghai Merchant Corps stationed in the Tangshan Road camp suffered from abdominal upsets, suspected to be caused by meat poisoning from the lunch. However, all but four people who are still too weak to get up have resumed their regular duties as of yesterday, Thursday. The meat sent to the Public Health Department of the Municipal Council for testing has been found to contain only a trace of toxic bacteria, probably due to contamination of the meat. Friday's Japanese newspapers in Shanghai reported that the illness was caused by members of the Red Party poisoning the lunch. However, after testing by the laboratory, it was found that the meat did not contain any metallic poisons, which was denied yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway to Run Qiantang Tidal Bore Excursion Trains on October 6th, 7th, and 8th <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway usually runs special trains back and forth for three days during the annual Qiantang Tidal Bore viewing season. Last year, due to the serious national crisis and the Shanghai Incident, the Qiantang Tidal Bore excursion train on this route was suspended. This year, as the Qiantang Tidal Bore viewing season is approaching, the Railway Bureau is specially preparing special trains and arranging for viewing groups and has hired civilian boats to connect and transport passengers. The route has now selected October 6th, 7th, and 8th (i.e., August 17th, 18th, and 19th of the lunar calendar) to run a special Qiantang Tidal Bore excursion train back and forth once a day from Shanghai North Station and Xieqiao. Each time, it will consist of seven first and second-class carriages, one third-class carriage (specially prepared for storing meals and supplies), and one third-class guard car, totaling nine carriages (as one train). It is stipulated that there will be 430 first and second-class seats. The special train timetable is listed below: (October 6th) The special train departs from North Station at 6:50 AM, from Fanwangdu at 7:08 AM, from Xujiahui at 7:16 AM, from Songjiang at 8:05 AM, from Jiaxing at 9:23 AM, and arrives at Xieqiao at 10:12 AM. The special train departs from Xieqiao to return to Shanghai at 3:40 PM and arrives at Shanghai North Station at 7:00 PM. (October 7th) The special train departs from Shanghai North Station at 7:10 AM, from Fanwangdu at 7:17 AM, from Xujiahui at 7:34 AM, from Songjiang at 8:23 AM, from Jiaxing at 9:40 AM, and arrives at Xieqiao at 10:29 AM. The special train departs from Xieqiao to return at 4:05 PM and arrives at Shanghai North Station at 7:25 PM. (October 8th) The special train departs from Shanghai North Station at 7:45 AM, from Fanwangdu at 8:03 AM, from Xujiahui at 8:11 AM, from Songjiang at 8:58 AM, from Jiaxing at 10:14 AM, and arrives at Xieqiao at 11:03 AM. The special train departs from Xieqiao to return at 4:30 PM and arrives at Shanghai North Station at 7:50 PM. After disembarking from the special train at Xieqiao, the passengers will be taken care of by the railway police accompanying the train, and the Railway Bureau will specially prepare 50 civilian boats to connect and transport each boat containing 10 passengers to land outside the East Gate of Haining.

<p>Yellow Disaster Relief Association's Emergency Relief Personnel Depart Today</p>
<h3 id="e157">Director of Henan Investigation and Relief Office Confirmed as Yang Zigong, Directors of Shandong and Hebei to be Determined Today <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Xi Dejiong, director of the disaster relief group of the National Government Yellow River Flood Relief Committee, has been extremely busy planning the distribution of relief funds and recruiting emergency relief personnel since returning to Shanghai on Tuesday after attending the committee's regular meeting in Nanjing. According to Mr. Xi's statement to a Xin Sheng News Agency reporter yesterday, the committee initially intended to establish only Shandong and Henan investigation and relief offices due to the affected areas of Puyang, Dongming, and Changyuan in Hebei Province bordering Shandong and Henan, being far from the provincial capital and having inconvenient transportation. However, due to circumstances and customs, it was deemed inconvenient, and it was decided to establish three offices. As for the candidates for director of the investigation and relief offices, only Henan has been decided, with Mr. Yang Zigong being appointed. Mr. Yang served as the special commissioner for emergency relief in Henan Province and the director of the 18th work relief district during the major flood two years ago and is very familiar with the local situation. The candidates for director of the Shandong and Hebei investigation and relief offices will be determined tomorrow (today). Mr. Yang Zigong, Mr. Gao Dajing, director of the purchasing and transportation office of the group (deputy director of the Lishi Society), and the personnel of the two offices are scheduled to depart tomorrow (today) to implement relief efforts. As for the distribution of relief funds, although regulations have been formulated based on local reports and aerial surveys, funds are being allocated separately for relief. However, it may still be necessary to consider revisions after the investigation personnel conduct on-site investigations and reports. During the conversation, he showed photos of the disaster area taken during the aerial inspection with Mr. Liu Ruiheng and Mr. Zhou Xiangxian last week, where villages were completely submerged in water, with only the tops of trees visible above the water, demonstrating the severity of the disaster.</p>
<h3 id="e158">The Executive Yuan Approves That the Regulations on Leasing Houses Need Not Be Abolished <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Bar Association believed that the Regulations on Leasing Houses promulgated by the Shanghai Municipal Government infringed upon judicial authority and had already submitted this matter to the joint meeting of executive and supervisory committee members. Member Zhou Shiying also proposed a suggestion, requesting the association to submit a petition to the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Judicial Yuan, and other heads of departments, requesting them to order the Shanghai Municipal Government to immediately abolish the Regulations on Leasing Houses. After the meeting resolved to pass this motion, it drafted a document to be submitted to the various departments and also sent a letter to the Municipal Government. The Executive Yuan has approved that the request to abolish the Regulations on Leasing Houses should not be considered.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Jardine Matheson Dispute Resolved, All Workers Resumed Work Yesterday <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Twenty workers were granted subsidies and dismissed; the rest were reinstated.</p>
<p>According to Dagong News Agency, Jardine Matheson Tug and Lighter Company in the French Concession recently laid off over a hundred people in succession, causing repercussions among all workers. Party and government officials were dispatched to mediate, but it was ineffective, leading to a work slowdown. The day before yesterday morning, more than thirty workers on ten tugs and lighters of the company also joined the work slowdown to show their support. Song Wenkui, the company's Chinese foreman, was deeply concerned that the strike would escalate and become difficult to contain. He invited Mr. Du Yuesheng to mediate. Mr. Du invited Zhu Xuefan and Zhou Xuexiang, members of the General Labor Union, to convene labor and management for mediation the day before yesterday afternoon. As a result, the following resolutions were made: (1) The twenty workers dismissed on August 1st were allowed to be dismissed, and the company would subsidize severance pay. (2) The remaining eighty-plus workers were all allowed to return to work. (3) Wages for the period of the slowdown and the dismissed workers would be paid as usual. Both parties were satisfied and announced the resolution. All the workers boarded the tugs at the Bund yesterday afternoon and returned to work on various lighters as usual, setting off firecrackers to welcome the dismissed workers back to work.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Social Bureau Handles Ash Industry Dispute <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Reciprocity Contract Should Still Be in Effect</p>
<p>The Mineral Ash Industry Association had a dispute with the Zhichen Brick and Tile Company, a member of the Brick and Tile Industry Association, over the unauthorized transportation of mineral ash to Shanghai, which had lasted for over a month. Although it could have been resolved earlier through repeated mediation by the Municipal Public Security Bureau and the Social Bureau, the company owner, Ling Shumei, raised the issue of the validity of the reciprocity contract, resulting in deep disagreements between the two parties, making it impossible to reach an agreement, and the mediation ultimately broke down. It is now learned that the case has been reviewed and adjudicated by the Social Bureau. The full text of the instructions to both parties is recorded below: (Instructions to the Mineral Ash Industry Association) Noted. It has been verified that the case and the complaint submitted by Zhichen Company to the bureau have been approved and instructed to comply with the settlement reached by the two industries and the reciprocity contract. Please be informed. (Instructions to Ling Shumei, owner of Zhichen Ash Company) Noted. It has been verified that the case and the request from the Mineral Ash Industry Association to correct the company's violation of the settlement and breach of contract have been received. It has also been verified that the dispute between the brick and tile industry and the mineral ash industry was resolved by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce in April of the 20th year, stipulating that the ash suppliers should be responsible for supplying ash to the traders, and the traders should be responsible for selling the products of the ash suppliers. Unless it is necessary due to insufficient supply and demand, the traders must not establish purchasing offices and directly purchase ash themselves. The two industry associations resolved to comply with this agreement and added a reciprocity contract in December of the 21st year. Now that both industry associations exist, the validity of the previous contract naturally continues. How can it be said that the contract has been invalidated? Moreover, the merchant, as one of the representatives for the revision, should not be the first to violate it and directly purchase ash themselves. As for the Mineral Ash Industry Temporary Joint Business Office, which is a trading business, it is even more difficult to simply define it as illegal. You must comply with the settlement reached by the two industries and the reciprocity contract in managing the ash business, and do not cause further incidents and disturbances. Be sure to do so.</p>

<p>An old woman from Jiangbei, Zhang Cai, 45 years old, lived at No. 156, Pingliang Road, Pudong. Her husband was a dock worker, and they had no children. The old couple relied on each other and were extremely poor. Yesterday, she could not find a way to pay her hui club dues and only had a hundred copper coins. She suddenly had a strange idea and used the hundred copper coins to bet on a flower club "one tube," making a desperate gamble. As a result, she failed again. She was extremely frustrated and temporarily lost her mind, conceiving the idea of suicide. At around 9:00 AM, she hanged herself in the room when no one was around. When her husband returned to prepare her lunch, it was too late to save her. Someone reported it to the police, who used a car to send the body to the hospital and then to the mortuary for an autopsy, awaiting a report from the court for an examination.</p>

<p>Stone Bingrong, a big shot in the flower club gambling scene, recently established an open-air boat and sent his gang out every day to lure people into gambling. The day before yesterday, Gao Juchuan, a detective from the Municipal Public Security Bureau, suddenly received a report stating that a secret gambling den was set up in Lion Lane in the Nine Acres area. He immediately reported to Captain Lu and dispatched squad leader Chen Caifu, detectives Wu Songshan, and others to cooperate with the police chief of the First Precinct of the Second District to arrest Stone's associates Yu Kunyuan and Zhou Hengfu and seize many documents. Later, they cooperated with the French police to search Stone's home at No. 4, Chongde Fang, Minguo Road, in the French Concession, but Stone had fled upon hearing the news. Only one associate, Zhu Fu, was arrested and transferred to the team to await transfer to the judicial section for strict handling.</p>

<p>Since the ticket takers of the Shanghai Chinese British Public Bus Company organized the Business Improvement Autonomy Association, the association's affairs have progressed exceptionally quickly. The association's purpose is to eliminate corruption, protect jobs, increase wages, improve treatment, and connect feelings. The association has been particularly active in eradicating corruption, so the situation of corruption has decreased in the past month and is no longer as blatant as it used to be. The company has praised the association's noble purpose and proper procedures. In addition to improving the copper coin reward system, it also provides a subsidy of two jiao in ocean money per day to compensate for losses. It has recently been learned that the association believes that the corruption of ticket takers greatly affects the interests of passengers. If the company's income is short and there are no profits, it will have to increase fares, which will increase the burden on the general public. Therefore, the corruption of ticket takers is a direct loss to the company and an indirect loss to passengers. In addition to dispatching investigators in plain clothes for self-inspection, the association is also asking all sectors of society to monitor, so that the automatic crackdown on the corrupt part will be even easier to achieve good results. In addition to eliminating corruption, the association has also organized a club, sports, and newspaper sections to improve the environment of the ticket takers. It is still being organized, and it is reported that the basketball court is under construction.</p>

The detachment, in addition to investigating, ordered the local保 (bail) to report the incident to the local court for an autopsy. Inspector Kong and others arrived on the scene to confirm the death and ordered the body to be collected.</p>

<p>German Strength Brand Beef Extract Sells Well in Shanghai The German Huada Pharmacy, the agent for the German Martha Pharmacy's cold-pressed Strength Brand Beef Extract and Chicken Extract, has seen a surge in sales in recent years, exceeding the new record of any supplement. The supplement is effective in increasing essence and marrow, replenishing blood and strengthening the spleen, and its tonic effect is considered the greatest. Government officials in China often choose it as a gift during the Autumn Festival, so its popularity is second to none. However, buyers should pay attention to the fact that anything with the character狮 (lion) alone or the character力 (strength) alone is not the authentic product. Only by clearly identifying the three characters Strength Brand can you be sure you are getting the genuine German product. It is reported that major companies and pharmacies across the country are selling it.</p>
<p>The difference is half the amount. The deadline is approaching, so those who wish to purchase must do so as soon as possible.</p>

<h3 id="e175">Also a First Prize <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— Lu</p>
<p>Buying airline tickets in the hope of winning the first prize; to get rich, you must win the first prize. It's either nothing, or it's hundreds of thousands of dollars at once. This all relies on luck, without needing any special skills. Therefore, everyone who buys airline tickets hopes to win the first prize.</p>
<p>Amidst the cries of suppressing the communists, there are bounties. Getting the head of so-and-so will reward you with so many tens of thousands of ocean dollars. A head is a head, and a reward is a prize. Head prize money can be simply called the first prize. This kind of first prize requires great skill and great luck. Not everyone can hope for it. Therefore, within the public mind, regarding the same "first prize", the masses only hope to win the first prize of hundreds of thousands of ocean dollars, but don't hope to win the also a first prize of so many tens of thousands of ocean dollars.</p>
<p>When talking about the value of the also a first prize, there is none greater than King Qi's first prize during the Warring States period, and none smaller than Ming Dynasty Grand Secretary Yang Sichang's first prize.</p>
<p>The Strategies of the Warring States has these few words: (Those who can obtain King Qi's head will be granted one thousand yi of gold and be ennobled with ten thousand households.) This is a first prize with both fame and fortune, which of course has richer benefits than the first prize of airline tickets. But who exactly obtained this first prize? The Strategies of the Warring States does not reveal the title of the winner, it's just talk.</p>
<p>In the twelfth year of Ming Chongzhen, Grand Secretary Yang Sichang supervised the army to suppress the bandits and issued a bounty: (斬張戲忠頭賞萬金。) (斬張戲忠頭賞萬金。)(Whoever斩 Zhang Xizhong's head will be rewarded with ten thousand gold.) Zhang Xianzhong knew this and also issued a bounty, mocking Sichang, opening with: (斩杨嗣昌头者赏三钱.) (斩杨嗣昌头者赏三钱。)(Whoever斩杨嗣昌头者赏三钱's head will be rewarded with three qian.)) This is a bit too much of a joke. Above three qian, there is no silver. Of course, it is not three qian of silver, but three wen of copper coins. It is commonly said, "Three wen can buy a stinky fermented eel", so could the head of a grand secretary be equal to a stinky fermented eel? Even if this "three qian" refers to three qian of silver, combining with the modern silver coin, it is only worth four jiao in ocean dollars. Can this be considered a first prize? It can only be considered a small last place.</p>
<p>Recently, I heard that they want to offer a reward to purchase and arrest the traitorous country prime ministers, and I think their also a first prize is probably only worth four mao. Anyway, it can't be done. Opening the price too high increases the value of their first prize, so what is it worth?</p>
<h3 id="e176">On Turtles <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Jie</p>
<p>The word "turtle," pronounced "gui" [transliteration omitted], is written as 龜 in ancient texts. Since ancient times, it has been regarded as the leader of shelled insects and is even linked with dragons, phoenixes, and unicorns, collectively known as the "Four Spirits." Although the appearance of a turtle is indeed not very attractive, people often see it as an auspicious creature and believe it to be a long-lived animal, so few people harm it, or at least do not dislike it. I remember reading old novels in my childhood that often contained phrases like: "This person has a round waist, broad shoulders, short neck, and pointed head, exactly matching the turtle form in physiognomy, and will surely achieve great fortune." There was also Mr. Li Guinian, a famous musician of the Tang Dynasty, who specifically used the character "turtle" in his name. This shows that the turtle was indeed highly respected in the past. Even today, the character "turtle" can often be found in Japanese names, such as "Takahashi Kamekichi" and the like.</p>
<p>I don't know when it started, but the character 烏 (wū, crow) was suddenly added to the top of the character "turtle." People wouldn't mention the character "turtle" normally, but when they did, they would shout: "烏龜! (wū guī, turtle, cuckold)" Some of the most impolite people would even say "臭烏龜! (chòu wū guī, stinking turtle/cuckold)" freely, thoroughly insulting the character "turtle" and even using it as a euphemism for those "small husbands who knowingly tolerate their wives' adultery." But this is completely illogical. First, turtles only have "Miss" or "Mrs.," not "Mr.," so they cannot represent males at all. The "Yupian" (玉篇, a Chinese dictionary) clearly states:</p>
<p>"龜. 文也。進也。外骨内肉。天性無雄，以爲雄也。"</p>
<p>("Turtle. Patterned. Advancing. Outer bone, inner flesh. Naturally without males, they consider females as males.")</p>
<p>Therefore, there is also the saying "蛇盤烏龜" (shé pán wū guī, a snake coiled around a turtle), which is a very obvious confirmation. Moreover, the two characters "烏龜" have no origin at all, and "臭烏龜" is even more out of the question! Because we have read the "Erya" (爾雅, a Chinese encyclopedia), in the section on "Interpreting Insects," we have long seen this passage:</p>
<p>"十龜：一神龜，二靈龜，三攝龜，四寳龜，五文龜，六筮龜，七山龜，八澤龜，九水龜，十火龜。"</p>
<p>("Ten Turtles: One, divine turtle; two, spiritual turtle; three, guardian turtle; four, treasure turtle; five, patterned turtle; six, divination turtle; seven, mountain turtle; eight, marsh turtle; nine, water turtle; ten, fire turtle.")</p>
<p>Where is there any mention of "烏龜" (wū guī)?</p>
<p>I believe that the world's reckless trampling of this spiritual creature is also a great sin. The turtle has no personal relationship with me, but the facts cannot be erased, so I wrote this essay about turtles to speak up for them.</p>

<p>It is Precious to Have Sweetness</p>
<p>Whoever is a man walking on the street who doesn't look at women can be crowned a saint; whoever is a woman who speaks without being noticed: this woman has undoubtedly reached old age; a delicate shout and all men obey her, equally undoubtedly knowing that this woman is truly at the height of youthful beauty!</p>
<p>Some are afraid on one hand, and secretly delighted on the other; afraid of the general male making a ruckus, and secretly delighted that they possess an enticing beauty; these types of women love to be accompanied by the same sex when going out: but those with sweetness do the opposite. She can use her sweetness as a nurse, while simultaneously being proud in front of many shady men.</p>
<p>We see it the most in parks; she will use a wide-brimmed hat and a walking stick to scare off the crowd; this is a silent signal that avoids much entanglement; otherwise, men will often pretend to be unintentionally sitting next to a woman's empty seat; so many women do not like walking alone in the park, because Shanghai seems to have too many people using improper means to pick up girls, but conversely, nowadays there are women who have profound knowledge, deliberately leaving an empty seat next to them to lure ignorant men in; naturally this kind of woman has a clear background; it's just that the air in the park is hard to say is fresh!</p>

<p>Chapter Fifteen: Guests Leave with Shy Smiles and Gentle Feelings, Old Enemies Arrive, and the Letter Ignites Sadness</p>
<p>Ji Zhi thought: Being a company commander, earning money must be quite a lot, right? It is said that after the salaries are issued, after he pulls out the kickbacks, your business must be better. The shop assistant said: You say being a company commander earns a lot, but that company commander Zhao doesn't even want to do it. I remember this spring, he and a company commander Guan were drinking here, planning to marry a wife. But the family of this bride did not like soldiers, so company commander Zhao became anxious. He said he would quit being a company commander. Company commander Guan persuaded him repeatedly, scolding him, saying that reaching the position of company commander was not easy, and it would not be worth it to lose it for the sake of marrying a wife. When Ji Zhi heard this, he couldn't help but feel a great stimulation in his heart, and even if he wasn't drunk, his face turned red first. He asked: Do you know which family's daughter he was talking about? The shop assistant said: I thought to myself that wanting to resign from his post to marry a wife must mean that this girl is very beautiful. So, I paid attention and listened. It seemed that this girl and company commander Zhao were neighbors. They lived on Haitian Street. Ji Zhi's heart skipped two beats, and he said: Oh! Still neighbors, I wonder if the marriage was successful? The shop assistant said: From the looks of it, the marriage seems to have been successful. Later, company commander Zhao came here a couple of times, and his friends often joked with him, saying that he was going to marry a wife, but he was still doing his job. I don't think there is such a fool in the world who would be willing to lose his job for the sake of a wife. Ji Zhi said: That's not necessarily true? There are plenty of people who lose their jobs for women. There was someone on the road who lost his job out of anger because he couldn't get a wife, not to mention that he was still getting one. As he said this, he laughed loudly, picked up his wine cup, and took a sip of wine. The shop assistant couldn't see through what he meant. What business is it of yours who company commander Zhao marries that you are so anxious? (One nine five)</p>
<h3 id="e179">Soviet Russia's Excavation of Imperial Tombs <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>To alleviate famine, Soviet Russia excavated the imperial tombs of Petrograd. They first opened the tomb of the recent Alexander III, then Alexander I, but the tomb was empty; it is said that Alexander III died in Taganrog, and was later buried in Petrograd, but now it is confirmed that the emperor Alexander lived as a monk in Siberia, ending his days there. Our country also has such mysteries. It is said that Emperor Shizu of the Qing Dynasty broke through the illusions of the world and secretly went to Mount Wutai to become a monk, but because the Qing court deeply concealed the matter, it remains a mystery to this day. According to historical accounts, Emperor Shizu was the first emperor of the Qing Dynasty to enter the Pass, and when he ascended the throne, he was very young. The Empress Dowager ruled the country and had an affair with Dorgon, the uncle of Emperor Shizu, and later formally married him, like the folk custom of "the uncle taking over the sister-in-law." At that time, Emperor Shizu's knowledge had developed, and he harbored hidden pain in his heart, but there was nothing he could do, and he had to formally issue an edict, respectfully inviting his uncle to enter the palace to live with the Empress Dowager, which was extremely scandalous! Furthermore, the matter of failing to take a certain concubine was even more discouraging, so there was a legend that he became a monk. In the past year, a great wave of tomb robbery suddenly arose around Pingjin, and the tombs of great figures of the Ming and Qing dynasties, such as Liu Jin and Dorgon, were successively robbed, and even the Qing imperial tombs were not spared, but the tomb of Emperor Shizu was not robbed. Therefore, some people thought this way: if Emperor Shizu's tomb were excavated, it would be a rare opportunity to dispel the mystery, as long as there was no corpse in the tomb, the story of his becoming a monk would be confirmed. Indeed, this is a rare opportunity, but how can we openly excavate and verify it if the petty thieves have not robbed it? I also have a feeling: great figures of the past were all buried richly after death, which just encouraged theft over the years. After the change of dynasties, they were mostly unable to avoid being exposed and their bones uncovered. Even Empress Lü could not avoid being dug up as a lascivious corpse in times of chaos. It is better to be an ordinary poor person who can sleep peacefully forever. Just like the Russian</p>
<p>imperial tombs, if they were not buried in silver coffins and with treasures, there would not have been the act of excavation. Secondly, foreigners indeed do things in an orderly and methodical manner. The Soviet Russia's excavation of imperial tombs also organized a coffin-opening committee, and the excavation was carried out according to the orders of the chairman of the committee, while our country is just petty thieves robbing at night. This point cannot be compared, but the Soviet Russia's excavation was completely secret. This time, it was a Soviet political detective who leaked the news, which was published in a newspaper in Warsaw, the capital of Poland, and then spread to the world, which is somewhat similar to our country's digging, isn't it? Just kidding!</p>

<p>Once upon a time, there was a young and strong shepherd who wanted to choose a maiden to be his wife. He knew of three maidens who were equally beautiful, so he had difficulty choosing. Which one should he choose? So he went to ask his mother for guidance, asking her to decide for him. She said: "Prepare a table of food and wine, and invite these three equally beautiful girls to eat. Place some cheese in front of each of their seats, and pay attention to how they eat it, to determine the standard for choosing." The young shepherd obeyed his mother's instructions and prepared a table of food and wine, and placed some cheese on the table. Then he invited the three beautiful girls to eat. The first girl swallowed the cheese together with its rind; the second girl hastily and carelessly cut off the rind of the cheese before eating it, but she cut it too quickly, so that a lot of the delicious cheese was lost together with the rind; the third girl slowly and carefully cut off the rind of the cheese before eating it, and the amount of rind she cut off was neither too much nor too little. The young shepherd saw these three different ways of eating and went to tell his mother. She said: !</p>
<p>"You can choose the third girl to be your wife"; because she knew from the way she ate cheese that the third girl was a meticulous, gentle, shrewd, and capable person. Sure enough, after they got married, they lived a very happy life.</p>

<p>— Yin Feng</p>
<p>Jake and Bailey are twins, identical in appearance and figure. In a certain week, they will hold a celebration for their sixth birthday, so they plan to save some money to buy birthday gifts for each other. Now Jake knows a man named Mr. Smith who has an adorable puppy for sale, something Bailey would definitely like. Bailey also knows about this puppy and thinks what a great birthday gift it would be to buy it for Jake.</p>
<p>So one morning, Bailey went to Mr. Smith's house and said:</p>
<p>"Mr. Smith, how much do you want for your puppy?"</p>
<p>"You want to buy the puppy, great," Mr. Smith said, "It's very cheap, it only costs five shillings." But Bailey only had four shillings and eleven pence on him, not enough for five shillings, so Mr. Smith said: "It doesn't matter, since your birthday is on Friday, I'll keep the puppy and not sell it to anyone else. On Friday evening, you can bring five shillings and take the puppy home."</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, on Wednesday, Jake brought five shillings to Mr. Smith's house to buy the puppy. Mr. Smith was not at home, Mrs. Smith went to the door and took one look, and she thought he was Bailey without a doubt. She took his money and gave him the puppy. Bailey really went to Mr. Smith's house again on Thursday. When Mr. Smith saw that the puppy was gone, he knew it had already been sold to someone else.</p>
<p>"I'm very sorry," he said, "Would you like to buy a bunny instead?" So Bailey bought a bunny for Jake. On the morning of their birthday, the twins looked out the window as soon as they got out of bed. Children! What do you think they saw? Let me tell you. They saw two birthday gifts running around on the grass, looking very happy. They had never seen anything so friendly in their lives. Of course, Bailey was very surprised to see this puppy, and Jake also loved this bunny very much. In the past, these twins always divided everything equally, but now they agreed that the puppy and the bunny should belong to both of them. From then on, they did everything well.</p>
<p>(Children! The two names "shilling" and "penny" in this story should be explained. These are the names of British coins, just like our country has coin names such as "silver dollar," "dime," and "steel yuan." They are not decimal, twelve pence is one shilling, just like twelve feet is one inch. The dimes commonly used in the Shanghai market now are also not decimal, one silver dollar can be exchanged for more than twelve dimes.)</p>

<p>Chinese Football Club Old Members Registration</p>
<h3 id="e190">Starts immediately <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>This year's Chinese Football Club competition is scheduled to be held at the Promotion Association field as usual. However, due to the conflict with the two major citywide and national games in the recent months of September and October, the field, players, referees, etc., have all been affected. Therefore, the competition date will inevitably be delayed. The Promotion Association secretariat is actively preparing and has decided to start accepting registrations from old members immediately, with a deadline of September 30th.</p>
<p>All old members of the club who wish to continue to participate in this year's competition, or who do not wish to participate this year for various reasons but wish to retain their membership, should have their team managers provide their contact information and formally register or notify the Promotion Association by letter. Those who fail to register or notify by the deadline will be considered as not participating in the competition or withdrawing their membership. All teams are requested to implement this immediately to avoid delays.</p>
<p>As for the recruitment of new members this year, it will depend on the number of teams joining that were old members, and a decision will be made later. If recruitment is necessary in the future, the registration period will begin in early October. Please pay attention.</p>

<p>Scheduled to Go to Beijing on the 5th of Next Month</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Tianjin) The National Games are scheduled to be held in the capital on Double Tenth Day. The preliminary selection meeting for Hebei Province's participation was opened on the 18th, and the preliminary rounds for various events began on the 14th. The finals for each event were completed on the 19th. Due to the small number of participants in this preliminary and final round, everyone lacked a competitive spirit, so the performances were not very exciting. In particular, most of the track and field events did not meet the standard. Only Dong Jingchun in the 200-meter breaststroke broke the national record with a time of 3 minutes and 16.5 seconds. (According to the 17th North China Games, the national record holder for the 200-meter breaststroke was Huang Maoyuan with a time of 3 minutes and 28 seconds). This was barely satisfactory. As for women's swimming, Hebei Province has never had anyone participate, but this time Ms. Li Luanding showed her skills, which can also be regarded as unprecedented. Yesterday (the 20th) at 2:00 PM, the selection committee was convened in the Department of Education, and the representative team was selected. The selection was completed at 6:30 PM. All elected representatives should report within today (the 21st) and tomorrow to fill out commitment forms. Those who fail to report within the deadline will be replaced by alternates. They are scheduled to go to Beijing from Tianjin on the 5th of next month. During the period before departure, each team leader will lead daily practice sessions. The names of the representatives are listed below:</p>

<p>(Havas, Paris, 22nd) American and French professional tennis players began their matches today at the Roland Garros tennis court, with an audience of approximately 4,000 people. The French players were Cochet and Paria, while the American players were Tilden and Pounce. The format of the competition is similar to the Davis Cup, with two singles matches on the first day, one doubles match on the second day, and two singles matches on the final day.</p>
<p>The first match today was between Cochet and Pounce. Pounce boldly adopted an aggressive strategy, his forehand shots accurate and swift, forcing Cochet to play defensively. Pounce even took the lead at 4-3 at one point, but Cochet then displayed his best tennis of the era, leveling the score at 4-4. He then won two consecutive games to take the first set 6-4. The skill displayed by both players in the second set was truly a sight to behold. Cochet frequently went to the net for volleys, allowing him to gain a 5-4 advantage. However, Pounce won three consecutive games, winning the set 7-5. In the third set, both Cochet and Pounce hit the ball with proper form. Cochet ultimately won 6-4. In the fourth set, Pounce launched a fierce attack, causing Cochet to run around the court, unable to keep up. Pounce was flawless, winning the set 6-0. In the fifth set, Pounce ultimately struggled to cope with fatigue. When Cochet took a 3-0 lead, Pounce attempted a counterattack, but Cochet's forehand and backhand shots landed perfectly, interspersed with excellent drop shots, allowing him to gain a significant 5-1 advantage. Although Pounce managed to win back two games, making it 5-3, Cochet ultimately won 6-3. The final score was 6-4, 5-7, 6-4, 0-6, 6-3.</p>
<p>The second match was between Tilden and Paria. At the beginning, the game was fast-paced. Tilden won the first set 6-3. Then, the game was suspended due to rain. After an hour, the rain stopped, but the court was still damp. Tilden took advantage of the situation, frequently attacking the corners, causing Paria to exhaust himself. Thus, Tilden won the second set 6-3. In the final set, Tilden's technique was superb, his shots landing accurately, ultimately winning 6-2. At the end of the first day, both France and America had each won a set.</p>

Two types of tables were made for teaching subjects, the first table applies to general (mostly urban normal schools), and the second table applies to normal schools located in rural areas (mostly rural normal schools), and it was resolved (percentage of teaching hours for each type of teaching subject) as follows: A. Normal schools are divided into two tables. The first table divides teaching subjects into four types: (1) General subjects (that is, the basic subjects of the original draft are revised) 65%, (2) Education subjects 20%, (3) Education practice 10% to 12%, (4) Elective subjects 5% to 3%, (Education practice is 10%, elective subjects are 5%, if it is 12%, elective subjects are 3%, it should be listed horizontally to make up the percentage)</p>

D. Special normal course and simplified normal course (original drafts fourth and seventh) Due to the different levels of enrollment (the former recruits high school or vocational high school graduates, and the latter recruits junior high school graduates, the percentage of teaching hours for each type of teaching subject must be revised according to the original draft, so these two subjects and the previously resolved three types (A, B, C) of schools (normal schools, simplified normal schools, kindergarten normal courses) are divided into four groups, and group meetings will be held on the morning of the 23rd, and a review meeting will be held in the afternoon.

<p>(Tianjin, 22nd) The 96 first-year students of Beiyang Engineering College, after being expelled, are scattered in various hotels. Most of them hope to repent and return to the college. There are still 100 security guards stationed in the college for protection. Classes resumed as usual on the 22nd. The president convened a college affairs meeting on the evening of the 22nd and planned to conduct a screening of the expelled students in the near future to eliminate the bad and keep the good. It is estimated that most of them will return to the school.</p>
<h3 id="e232">Severe Punishment for Forging Diplomas <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education has already issued an interpretation regarding whether those who present forged graduation diplomas from various provinces and cities should be punished. Now, because there are further requests for interpretation, it has been reported to the Judicial Yuan for interpretation. The general idea is that although it is understandable that students forge graduation diplomas in the hope of furthering their education, the diplomas bear official seals, and forging seals is a crime, and should be punished with several months of imprisonment. It is heard that the Ministry of Education has interpreted according to the Yuan's order and will soon issue a circular to the education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities and the universities and colleges directly under its jurisdiction for compliance.</p>

<h3 id="e233">Formal Publication of the Index of the Siku Quanshu Reprinted by Photography <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>Recommendations from the Index Compilation Committee: Three Matters</p>
<p>180 Types of Books Selected for Printing</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Education announced its plan to reprint the Siku Quanshu by photography, scholars from the north and south have given it extreme support. However, the method of selection requires specialized research and joint discussion. In order to gather opinions from all sides, the Ministry of Education appointed Li Shengduo, Dong Kang, Fu Zengxiang, Chen Yuan, Yuan Tongli, Xu Naichang, Liu Hanyi, Zhang Zongxiang, Xu Hongbao, Fu Sinian, Liu Yiwei, Zhang Yuanji, Ma Heng, Zhao Wanli, and Gu Jiegang on August 15th as members of the Index Compilation Committee. They were assigned to specially review the (Draft Index of Unpublished Books) compiled by the Central Library, and it was decided that one month would be for discussion and two months for compilation. Each committee member corresponded back and forth, and the list of books to be selected for printing has been compiled. The committee members selected 142 types of books from the 366 types of books in the draft index of the Central Library, and added 38 types of books that were omitted from the index. All books with good editions that could be substituted were eliminated for separate printing. The selection was extremely careful. Yesterday, a letter was jointly sent to Minister Wang, explaining the reasons and attaching three methods, which are very insightful. The index was released simultaneously in Beijing, Ping, and Shanghai yesterday. The letter from the committee members to the Minister of Education and the attached methods are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e234">Letter to Minister of Education <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>To Minister Xue Ting,</p>
<p>Previously, we received your letter of appointment and attached a copy of the index of unpublished books of the Siku Quanshu. We are grateful for the commission to review it. Now, after repeated discussions and detailed examination by our colleagues, we have selected 143 types of books from the original index, and added 37 types, totaling more than 90,000 leaves. We have also formulated three methods, which are listed below. We respectfully await your inspection and hope that you will make a quick decision and complete the project soon, which we will all be grateful for.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<h3 id="e235">Three Attached Methods <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>(1) The Library Edition and Good Editions Should Be Equally Emphasized. Among the books recorded in the Siku Quanshu, there are many that have not been printed since the Qing Dynasty. However, they can generally be divided into two categories. The first category is books compiled from the Yongle Encyclopedia that have no other editions to replace them, or those collected by the Siku that originated from old Song and Yuan editions, or those that are not far from the era and are extremely rare. We have selected 143 types of books from the current draft index of unpublished books and added 37 types, tentatively named the Siku Orphaned Edition Series. The second category is Song, Yuan, and Ming printed editions or manuscript editions that are better than the Library Edition. These will be compiled into a separate index, named the Siku Rare Edition Series. The former, after being reviewed and approved by the ministry, will still be handled by the Central Library and the Commercial Press according to the contract, in order to facilitate early circulation. For the latter, we propose that the ministry order the Peking Library to formulate a plan and gradually prepare for it. Our colleagues will certainly do their best to contribute to this great undertaking. (1) Collation Notes and Index Should Be Printed and Distributed Simultaneously. In addition to the Wen Yuan Ge, there are other editions of the Siku Quanshu stored in the country, such as the Wen Jin Ge. Although they come from the same source, there are often differences in the text. After the previous books are printed, we propose that the ministry order the Central Library to compare them and write collation notes to avoid regrets. In addition, most of the books in the Library Edition do not have indexes at the beginning of each volume, which should also be added and distributed simultaneously to facilitate reading. (1) Each Book in the Series Should Be Printed and Distributed Separately. The series contains many works written before the Song and Yuan dynasties, many of which are urgently needed by scholars for research and examination. However, the volumes are vast and not within the reach of poor scholars. We propose that the Commercial Press be ordered to print more separate editions at low prices to make them easily available to poor scholars, and that ancient books can be widely disseminated, so as not to fail the ministry's elegant intention to promote scholarship.</p>

<p>The published list of books includes 35 types of classics, 15 types of history, 24 types of philosophy, and 106 types of collections, totaling 180 types.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau issued an order yesterday to municipal primary and secondary schools and kindergartens in the city, stating: "The health education program has been implemented in the city in the 21st year and will continue to be carried out this year. Regarding the physical examination of teachers and staff, it will be held starting this year. Each school should guide the personnel to be examined to quickly correct their shortcomings in order to emphasize health and serve as a model. You are hereby ordered to comply with this order."</p>
<h3 id="e238">Restructuring of the Shen Bao Correspondence School of Journalism <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>Since its opening in April of this year, the Shen Bao Correspondence School of Journalism has received enthusiastic enrollment. Recently, due to the original organization being insufficient to cope with the demand, a special commissioner has been appointed to preside over school affairs starting in September. Experts in journalism in China have also been hired to share teaching responsibilities, and the school address has been moved from the Continental Commercial Building back to this building. The internal organization has been completely revamped. The lectures that were not fully issued previously will be fully issued according to the regulations starting in October. It is estimated that there will be more than 100,000 words of various lectures each month, not including exercises. Student homework will be personally graded by the professors of each course, without being tired of asking for details. If students can completely complete each subject within one year, it is equivalent to the courses taught in a two-year vocational school, that is, they can be fully trained to become a very useful journalism talent. After another six months or a year of practical training, their ability can be responsible for reporters in major newspapers. The restructuring of the school has been completed, and the third enrollment of new students is also being continued at the same time. Anyone who has graduated from high school or has equivalent qualifications can apply for admission at any time. After passing a written examination, classes will begin. There are a total of 18 types of lectures in the school, divided into required and elective courses. The required courses are: 1. Chinese, 2. Practical Journalism, 3. Printing Knowledge, 4. Newspaper Organization and Management, 5. Advertising, 6. Newspaper Promotion, 7. Current Affairs Research, 8. Correspondence Practice, 9. Publication Law, 10. Reporter Knowledge, ten types. The elective courses are: 1. Selected Readings of English Newspapers (and English News Production), 2. Introduction to Journalism, 3. Foreign Journalism, 4. Domestic Journalism, 5. Commentary Writing, 6. News Storage, 7. Prose Research, 8. Photography, eight types. Each course is a practical and useful knowledge, and the knowledge and skills that researchers of journalism should have are also included. The study period is one year, and the tuition fee, including the lecture fee and postage, is only 15 yuan per year. The low tuition fee is unmatched by any other correspondence school. The purpose of the school is to cultivate domestic journalism talents. Those in the country who cannot afford to enter a formal vocational university but are interested in journalism should not miss this opportunity. Details will be sent upon request.</p>

<h3 id="e239">Inquiring About Impressions <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— Tao Zhui</p>
<p>Since the May Fourth Movement, it seems that Chinese people have developed a new habit: whenever a foreign celebrity or rich person arrives, they like to inquire about their impression of China.</p>
<p>When Russell came to China to lecture, radical youths held meetings and banquets to welcome him and inquire about his impressions. Russell said, "(You treat me so well that it's not good to say bad things.)" The radical youths were indignant, thinking he was slippery. When George Bernard Shaw traveled around China, reporters in Shanghai gathered to interview him and also inquired about his impressions. Shaw said, "(My opinions have nothing to do with you. If I were a warrior who killed a hundred thousand people, you would respect my opinions.)" Revolutionaries and non-revolutionaries were all indignant, thinking he was harsh.</p>
<p>This time, it was Prince Carl of Sweden who came to Shanghai. The reporter also published his impressions: "(…Wherever he went, he was warmly received by local officials and people, and he was extremely grateful and happy. This tour has brought him a very good impression of the government and people of your country, which will never be erased.)" This is the most stable, I think, and will not cause any trouble.</p>
<p>In fact, Russell and Shaw were not considered slippery and harsh. If there were a foreigner who, when asked about his impressions, first asked, "(What is your own impression of your own China?)" That would be a truly difficult article to write.</p>
<p>We were born and raised in China, so if we have feelings, they cannot be considered impressions); but opinions are fine; but how can opinions be expressed? Saying that we are like fish in muddy water, living in a confused and inexplicable way, doesn't sound like an opinion. Saying that China is very good is probably also difficult. This is what patriots mournfully call "(losing national self-confidence)," but it really seems to be lost. Asking everyone about their impressions is just like seeking omens and divination, because of the suspicion in their own hearts.</p>
<p>Within us, there are certainly those who express opinions. What we often see are those without power or courage, who have not "(killed a hundred thousand people)," but rather call themselves "(common people)," so their opinions are not "(respected)," that is, they are "(unrelated)" to everyone. As for the bigwigs who have power and influence, perhaps they were very radical when they were out of power, but now, they are silent 丨 China "(treats me so well that it's not good to say bad things.)" Looking at the current situation of the gentlemen who rose from the (New Tide Society) who welcomed Russell at the time and were indignant at his answer, it is really felt that Russell was not slippery, but a prophetic satirist, who said ten years later's thoughts in advance.</p>
<p>This is my impression, and it can be considered a mock answer, copied from the mouths of foreigners.</p>
<h3 id="e240">Peasant Poet <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— He Ru</p>
<p>Whether it's old poets or new poets, there is still a lack of peasant poets in the modern Chinese literary world. This is a fact. The collapse of the rural economy and the unbearable suffering of peasants have been felt by economists, politicians, and revolutionaries. Have sensitive poets not felt it? The land tax in Sichuan has been pre-collected for who knows how many years of the Republic of China. There are always hundreds of miscellaneous taxes, but unfortunately there are no detailed investigations or statistics. The special dispatch from Nanchang in the Shen Bao on the 20th said, "(The Economic Association investigated the land tax surcharges in 33 counties in eastern, western, and northern Jiangxi, reaching more than 90 types. In Yushan, each stone of rice is taxed more than 20 yuan. A certain weekly magazine reported that Guangfeng taxed up to 60 yuan per mu, and the rest also reached several times the regular tax, and the district, bao, and jia temporary apportionments are extorted anytime and anywhere, and cannot be investigated.)" Another dispatch said, "(The early rice in the Fu River has fallen to 1.8 yuan per dan. Because of the bao, jia, road construction, and bandit suppression donations and taxes, farmers want to sell cheaply even if they are starving, but no one buys. The rural area has become an Avici Hell.)" Is this Avici Hell limited to a corner of Jiangxi? Is there a paradise anywhere in the entire China? We do not expect great poets like Du Fu and Bai Juyi, who can have a little leisure and occasionally write a few poems about social problems, as long as there are small poets like Yu Fen and Nie Yizhong who are not valued by society, that would be enough for our literary world to boast about.</p>
<p>Speaking of Nie Yizhong, perhaps everyone is very familiar with him. "(Hoeing millet under the noonday sun, sweat drips onto the soil below. Who knows that every grain in the dish is hard-earned?)" This poem of compassion for farmers, which is said to be by Li Shen, is said to be by Nie Yizhong. We have read it in elementary school textbooks since we were young. There is also "(Selling new silk in February, selling new grain in May. Healing the sore in front of the eyes, cutting out the flesh in the heart.)" This poem, titled "Lamenting the Farming Family," is also the most widely recited work of Nie.</p>
<p>As for Yu Fen, he was not very famous at the time, and no one has praised him since. In fact, when it comes to peasant poets of the Tang Dynasty, he is perhaps more authentic than Nie Yizhong. Unfortunately, very few of their poems have been handed down, with only one volume recorded in the Complete Tang Poems. Like Nie Yizhong, Yu Fen was also stuck in the lower ranks. It is not difficult to explain why they sympathized with the farmers who had no one to complain to. Yu Fen's "Thoughts at Dawn in a Mountain Village":</p>
<p>Opening the door to see the millet, the neighbor lives by the water's edge. Today, the waves of the southern stream, last night's rain in western Sichuan. A shepherd boy wears a short raincoat, a waist flute awaits at the misty islet. Not asking the people by the water, he rides his cow and goes to the mountain. This kind of sketch of pastoral life is not as (rigid) as Tao Yuanming or Chu Guangyi. But his description of the suffering of peasants, such as saying "(The one plowing on the ridge, plants with his hand but his belly is hungry. The girl throwing the shuttle under the window, weaves with her hand but has no clothes on her body.)" (Hard Work Chant) "(The one who dwells in a rock cave, calls a dwelling his property. Although he is covered with a towel, he is not as good as a dog in a noble family.)" These are not what poets of the Tao, Xie, Wang, and Meng families, and even Chu Guangyi, who sing about pastoral landscapes, would deign to stain their noble poetic pens with.</p>
<p>We know that the famous warlord wars of the Tang Dynasty are referred to in historical books as the Disaster of the Fiefdoms. This kind of war fell on the heads of the peasants, while the warlords and bureaucrats took the opportunity to get promoted and make a fortune to marry concubines. Yu Fen, who can be called a peasant poet, unveiled the inside story of the war in his poem "Ancient Warfare," but it was only a minority of people who were satisfying their desires for money and beauty. The soldiers in this kind of war only got "(Red flesh, painful golden wounds, others become Wei Huo)" As for his saying "(A song of the ancient Liangzhou, six relatives live on blood. I advise you to have long eyebrows, learn to sing to feed your relatives.)" (Weaving Silk Song) Those who get promoted through nepotism have had enough!</p>
<p>In today's China, there are no thorough national heroes. If you want to be a national poet, you are suffering from a lack of great themes. It is not easy to deceive people by creating illusions and allegories. If there is a poet who is willing to use his noble poetic pen to describe the lowly peasants, there are many moving themes for you to choose from. The peasants will not reject you. Is there really no poet like Nie Yizhong or Yu Fen?</p>
<h3 id="e241">A Drama Without Clowns <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>I have seen very few Chinese spoken dramas, probably because the impression I got from some domestic films I watched before was so bad that I dared not go to see spoken dramas again. It is said that the stage is even more difficult than the silver screen.</p>
<p>However, I finally saw a few spoken dramas, and sure enough, the impression I got was even worse. What disappointed me the most was that there was not much difference from the so-called "civilized dramas." Even when performing a great tragedy, a few clowns would be added for no reason, turning the plot into a farce, and in the end, the audience would just laugh and leave. Of course, the fun was quite interesting, but the tricks of the Great World were even more interesting than this. Recently, I accidentally read a string of newspapers and suddenly found some eye-catching large characters in the advertisement column, "Roar, China!" This made me quite surprised. Anyone who cares a little about modern drama knows that this is a famous drama composed of new consciousness and new art. Naturally, this opportunity should not be missed. However, checking the small print next to it, I was disappointed again: it turned out that it was not a movie, but a spoken drama staged by Chinese people themselves, which I dared not watch again.</p>
<p>On the evening of September 16th, while strolling around Baixianqiao, I was suddenly dragged into the Golden Grand Theater by a friend wearing a badge with the word "Cadre" on his chest. Well, although I am not enthusiastic, I don't have to be as stubborn as Zilu and not understand worldly affairs.</p>
<p>This was the first day of the public performance, but the audience was not enthusiastic, but there was no need to be surprised. Just looking at the name, you could understand that there were no kisses or women's thighs. Although the Chinese are a country of etiquette, they seem to like kissing and women's thighs even more than foreigners.</p>
<p>The white lights went out, and the colored lights came on.</p>
<p>Merchant ships, warships, crosses, and gallows; fat-headed foreign compradors, laboring workers... appeared before my eyes.</p>
<p>On the stage, there was the victorious cheers of the oppressors and the tragic cries of the oppressed, but under the stage, the unconscious noise suddenly turned into dead silence.</p>
<p>"Roar, China!"</p>
<p>This slogan spread from the stage, and a thunderous echo suddenly broke out under the stage. The audience was awakened by this thunder and rushed out of the theater like a tide.</p>
<p>The cool night breeze calmed my tense emotions, and I felt that my heart was satisfied and full. I saw the excited faces of every audience member, which made me even happier.</p>
<p>Of course, such a meaningful spoken drama cannot yet be popularized among the masses, but being able to move a part of the audience is ultimately meaningful. Although the Drama Association's performance this time still has many shortcomings in terms of technique, the fact that it has this power to move proves that there are also many successes. And the clown who won the audience's laughter did not appear in this performance, which also proves that Chinese spoken drama is progressing.</p>

<p>—</p>
<p>(7) Killing People and Eating People</p>
<p>Someone wrote a novel that promotes the national spirit, called "The Battle of the National Gate." The most proud part of his writing, which is also the most nationalistic, is killing people. He himself gets drunk, raises his knife and splits open people's skulls, letting the white brain matter gush out from the top of their heads: he writes it as vividly as a dragon and a tiger, which makes one's heart palpitate. Because of reading this novel, I thought of an event recorded in "Haiguoting's Anecdotes":</p>
<p>During the Sui Dynasty, Ma Shumou and Zhu Can steamed children as food; during the Tang Dynasty, Gao Zan steamed his concubine and ate her. Yan Zhen and Dugu Zhuang both loved to eat human flesh, but they all made it into minced meat before eating. There were no raw eaters. During the Liang Dynasty, Yang Daosheng saw an old subordinate being tied up, drew his sword, gouged out his eyes, and swallowed them. During the Song Dynasty, Wang Yansheng captured some Hu people, held a wine banquet, tore off their ears with his hands, chewed on them for a long time, and then slowly drank a cup of wine. The captives were covered in blood and cried out in pain, but Wang Yansheng talked and laughed as if nothing had happened. He ate hundreds of people in total, which was worse than tigers and wolves.</p>
<p>Reading "The Battle of the National Gate" can make you tremble with excitement, while reading this record will make it even harder for you to retract your tongue. Wang Yansheng's spirit and the heroic act of splitting open skulls are both admirable. It is a pity that in 1927, in XX, we don't know who was the person who stripped women's clothes, executed them by shooting, and then inserted a kaleidoscope into the dead person's vagina and set it on fire to achieve pleasure. Otherwise, it can truly be said that these three are equal in their brutality. Writing here, I also remembered a similar record in "Shao Shi's Anecdotes": Emperor Wu of Han used Du Zhou as the chief justice of the imperial prison, arresting as many as sixty to seventy thousand people in a row. The number of officials who increased the charges reached more than one hundred thousand. During the reign of Empress Wu of Tang, when interrogating exiles, Wan Guojun killed three hundred people in one day, Liu Guangye killed nine hundred people, and Wang Deshou killed seven hundred people.</p>
<p>Killing people is truly an everyday occurrence in China, and it is the same in both ancient and modern times. What is especially commendable is that not only must the killing be plentiful, but it must also be artistic, with all kinds of postures and methods. China can truly be called a nation of murderers.</p>

<p>—</p>
<p>The garden, the old rusty chimney, the gravel, the accumulated water, the children by the water's edge, and the cat walking behind the children. Every day when I go out of the house, I see these things through the window, and I often think in my heart that I should go around to the back of the side house in the garden to see what's going on there. But why go? What to do? If someone suddenly asks, "What are you doing here?" Wouldn't that be embarrassing? Therefore, I have never been to this garden even once, and even this house will be moved soon. This is the fate of most adults: the door of the house is open to the street for adults. The garden is just the world of children.</p>
<p>The life of Ma Wufutelovna, a female teacher at the Illiteracy Eradication Center, is the life of a wanderer. She has lived in many houses; but for some reason, her thoughts still live in an unfinished house, and she has always been drifting when there was no garden in that house.</p>
<p>○ ○ ○ ○ ○</p>
<p>The small wooden house was very quiet, with two dim lamps lit; the small wooden house, which was usually so dirty, was illuminated very cleanly by the two lamps, and the shadows were beautifully reflected on the wall. The air in the room was warm and quiet, shrouded in Ding Jia's head, and the warmth and quiet made him drowsy, but he couldn't sleep. "(Eighteen plus six,)" Ding Jia wanted to drive away the Sandman, so he deliberately read aloud: "(Eighteen plus six equals twenty-four.)"</p>
<p>It was time to go to the Illiteracy Eradication Center for class immediately. But he hadn't memorized his homework well, and Ding Jia thought of the stern face of the female teacher Ma Wufutelovna, and he was a little worried.</p>
<p>"Why can't I always remember it?" he thought in his heart, and put on his clothes.</p>
<p>He was late for class.</p>
<p>"You are always late," Ma Wufutelovna complained to him: "Sit down quickly, don't disturb others."</p>
<p>The earthworker Ke Bidejin, about fifty-five years old, with a cunning and kind face, was holding a newspaper and reading slowly:</p>
<p>"Now we should first pay attention to the iron smelting furnace factory. In order to start the high-speed construction of this factory, we must make special efforts; the Party and social groups must..."</p>
<p>"That's right, you read it well," Ma Wufutelovna interrupted Ke Bidejin: "You have reviewed it at home, and you can understand it as soon as you hear it. It is most important to review at home. Just taking classes here, just taking classes here, there is no hope. If you don't review at home, you won't make progress."</p>
<p>She called Ding Jia's name:</p>
<p>"You read this book." She took out a small book from a full little leather bag and handed it to Ding Jia, she said: "These words are very clear."</p>
<p>"Can't I read the newspaper?" Ding Jia asked timidly.</p>

<h3 id="e244">Financial: U.S. Cotton Futures Optimistic; Gold Market Declines by $13.40 <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>The gold market was relatively flat yesterday at the opening, but suddenly plummeted at the close. There were few transactions in the market, and the market situation was also very mediocre. Initially, the foreign exchange rates showed no change in the British pound, but the U.S. dollar rose. The exchange rate between the British and American currencies increased by one cent, with the long rate at 75, the British-French exchange rate increased by a small fraction of 2.5, and the U.S.-French exchange rate increased by one cent. The future silver price at the Precious Metals Exchange increased by 3.5 and 1.5 percent, respectively. Private telegrams also increased by 25. Stocks rose by $1.50, U.S. cotton rose by 18 points, U.S. wheat decreased by 1.5 cents, and London gold increased by 10 points. The U.S. Treasury Department's new gold export price was $31.75, an increase of 4.2 cents compared to the previous day. The gross margin fell immediately after opening. Although it fell after opening, it remained stable because the HSBC listing did not change. Later, there were many short sellers. Generally, large firms such as the Guangdong group and Chang Sheng Yong and others were selling their goods, and the gold price gradually went downstream. Finally, the foreign exchange market was loose, and Xingye Ken Se sold at a low price. At the same time, it was rumored that they were selling notes aggressively, and people's hearts were frightened, and the wind of selling suddenly prevailed. At noon, it was approaching the $70 mark. It was found that the market situation in the first half of the day was sluggish. Reuters reported that U.S. President Roosevelt had approved loans to cotton farmers, but cotton farmers must reduce cotton fields from 40 million acres to 25 million acres next year. The current cotton production can obtain government loans of one cent per pound. U.S. cotton is bullish, and people's hearts are unsupported, and the initial price is $1,110, with a $9 discount for the October/November period. The market situation in the first half of the day is recorded below:</p>
<p>The opening price in the morning was $779, a decrease of $6.20 compared to the previous close. The opening price of goods was $8.60. The opening exchange rate was one shilling and three pence three one two five for recent sales of British exchange, and thirty yuan four three seven five for U.S. exchange. At the opening, Heng Yu Shunli and Heng Xing were selling, and Mitsui came out at thirty-one yuan for December, and then dropped to $6.50. Later, Zhifeng and Yong Yongfeng entered notes, but the market hovered because Ri Chang Yi Feng Yongdu sold. HSBC's listing was known in advance and did not change. HSBC once accepted U.S. dollars for January at thirty-one two five. Da De Cheng Heng Yu Fu Yu bought goods, and it rose to $9.20. Yi Feng Yong still sold and went downstream. After that, the U.S. dollar for December at zero six two five had a position, but there were few buyers. Shunli Heng Yu Heng Tai sold, and it fell back to $6. Sheng Da sold aggressively and became $5.50. Zheng Jin Mai Jia Li accepted U.S. dollars for January at three seven five. Da Fa Yongheng entered to $7, but after that, although the bank hoarded U.S. dollars for December at one eight seven five, one two five Ken Se, so the rise was flat, and there were few transactions, and the situation was flat, hovering around $6.

<p>There is a Clear Sign of a Squeeze</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market of the Chinese Securities Exchange was stable and firm, and the transactions were still mostly swaps. Although the sellers were surging, the buyers were not weak. The market was still unable to meet the supply and demand of chips due to the near delivery period, and the market price fluctuated slightly. However, since there were no special circumstances in the environment, both the buyers and sellers insisted on their prices, and both sides insisted on a market price of 0.05 yuan to 0.1 yuan. Yesterday's situation was that the bulls were slightly dominant. The two sessions closed in the morning, although they were still inevitably chaotic, but the trend was more up than down and relatively strong. The two sessions closed in the afternoon. The sellers, such as No. 21, were selling very vigorously, and at the same time, the demand from retail investors was also very active, so each session still had a good face of about 0.1 yuan. As a result, the market price was mostly strong in the near term and weak in the far term, with a slight sign of a squeeze. The gains ranged from 0.05 yuan to 0.3 yuan, and the losses also ranged from 0.05 yuan to 0.3 yuan, but the gains were more than the losses. Among them, only the disarmament in the near term fell by 0.3 yuan, and the far term also fell by 0.05 yuan.

<p>New Feng Yanghang reported on the 22nd that the New York stock market rebounded strongly, the goods were very strong, and the railway stocks were also good. The total number of transactions for the day was 3,310,000 shares. (Wheat) Yesterday, there were still many delays in the closing of the long positions, and the downward trend of the market attracted super new purchases, and the market was extremely unstable. There was a large sell-off of spot and powder, and we urgently hope that the market will be optimistic. (Cotton) The inflationary pressure in the South has subsided, and we support the government's purchase of limited high prices, so that the market can fundamentally recover and be equal to commerce. This is also the feeling and motivation of the prudent side. The cotton production report is quite good, and the trading volume is quite large due to the low price, and the potential is very good. (Silver) The market is uncertain due to the activity of speculators, and the closing is still good. The Dow Jones Index is listed below. Closing Price Change from Previous Day</p>

<p>The yarn market is trending firmer, and the rising trend is slightly rising. Because a certain yarn factory continued to purchase in large quantities, and at the same time, the evening newspaper reported that the government allocated 20 million yuan for cotton to maintain cotton yarn, the buyers were active, the market rose sharply and rose, but the sales of current yarn have not been smooth. The market in the afternoon was slightly tired, but the current buyers are absorbing very fiercely, and it is feared that it will be difficult to return to the previous level.</p>

<p>The cotton market continued to rise. The weather was cloudy and rainy. At the time of cotton picking, the continuous drizzle made it difficult to pick cotton, and the time was prolonged, and the delivery was delayed. At the same time, the buyers' intentions were strong, and the pulling force became stronger with this opportunity. However, a certain factory still dumped a large amount of cotton in October, about 10,000, and the market became slightly flat. The future situation is lacking in certainty.</p>

Egyptian spot cotton fell by 10 points. The Bombay cotton market initially fell along with American cotton, but later rose due to rain, short covering, and buying by speculators. Consequently, Bengal fell by 1 rupee 2.5 annas, Oomra fell by 1 rupee 7.5 annas, and Broach fell by 2.5 rupees. (Original Telegraph, 22nd)</p>

<h3 id="e258">A Review of the American Cotton Market for the Past Week <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>A telegram from New York on the 22nd reported on the cotton market for the past week, stating that the rise in the cotton market last week was due to the excitement of currency inflation and the weakness of the gold standard. However, after the authorities expressed opposition to inflation, there was a large amount of long liquidation. At the same time, prices fell, short covering was very strong, and fellow traders also made considerable purchases. Furthermore, there were rumors that the Soviet Union would have large cotton loans and France might purchase huge quantities of raw cotton. China also increased spot orders when prices fell. Domestic cotton mills also showed increased demand after the cotton cargo transactions of the previous week. Operators have slightly changed their estimates of this year's cotton harvest due to abnormal weather in the middle of the month. Generally speaking, everything depends on developments in Washington and further progress in industrial recovery.</p>
<h3 id="e259">Grain and Rice Prices Continue to Rise by Ten Cents Due to Rain <a href="#e259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) According to sources from the 20s, the market conditions are due to the overall scarcity of arrivals and the long-standing accumulation in the Pudong area. The situation has already shown signs of life. Customers, citing changing weather conditions, say that future trends are even more difficult to grasp, so it is better to take this opportunity to prepare slightly. Therefore, in addition to the 1,000 bags for wholesalers, retail sales are also relatively calm. The prices of thick-stalked, old rice, and new Zhongdu Yangjian all rose by several cents to over a dime, and the price of a yuan also rose by about a dime. Although the price of new Xiangjing is firm due to the scarcity of goods, it is subject to weather changes and cannot be taken as a standard.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, arrivals from various routes downstream numbered around 10,000 bags. Sales were very sluggish due to the rain. In the market, mid-grade and lower-grade broken rice carried tight white price plus one dime. Jian rice, Guojian rice, and Xixin粳 rice each increased by one dime, Dongxinjing rice increased by two dimes, Gaopojing rice, Xinbujian rice, and Du rice were stable, and Chenyangjian rice and Dukejian were firm.</p>
<h3 id="e260">Foreign Customers and Ningbo Merchants Continue to Actively Trade Xiang Rice <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>The price rose by three cents, with 20,000 bags traded.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market for foreign customer Xiang rice continued to rise. Because Zhejiang Province's Ningbo merchants actively made purchases, another 20,000 bags of foreign customer Xiang rice were sold yesterday. Among them, small squeezed foreign rice accounted for 15,000 bags, with a high opening price of 7.5 yuan, 7.2 yuan for the middle grade, and 7 yuan for the lower grade, which was three cents higher than the previous market. However, it was a rise of seven or eight cents compared to the beginning of the month. The reason is that after Guangdong Province slightly levied sales tax on foreign rice, all routes in Guangdong Province inquired early. The foreign rice, which had been suppressed for several days, immediately jumped again. In recent days, the market atmosphere has been particularly good due to the active trade by Ningbo merchants.</p>
<p>In addition to the foreign rice sold to Ningbo, 1,400 bags of Hunan machine Jing were also sold at a price of 7.3 to 7.15 yuan, and 1,000 bags of rough Jing were sold at a price of 5.95 yuan. 5,000 bags of Nanjing factory Xiang were sold at a price of 7 to 6.98 yuan, and 300 bags of Chen Xiang were sold at a price of 6.9 yuan. 450 bags of Xi Xiang were sold at a price of 7.2 yuan. The Fuzhou merchants also sold nearly 1,000 bags of Hunan rough Jing at the same price as above. Guangzhou, Shantou, and Chaozhou merchants have repeatedly inquired in recent days and have already purchased a small number. There is a tendency to continue to purchase and load in the future because the tax on foreign rice in that area has been shelved, making it necessary to purchase in the Yangtze River area. Yesterday, Shantou also sold 450 bags of Hunan rice at a price of 6.7 to 6.34 yuan. The price of all Xiang rice rose yesterday, each being about a dime better than the previous market.</p>
<h3 id="e261">Starch Rises Quickly and Steadily <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>After the market opened yesterday morning, starch prices showed an initial flat and then rising trend. Chicago and Canada also continued to rise by about four or five cents, so the market atmosphere was still flat when prices opened. This month still opened at 1.7 dimes, but due to outside speculation, there was gradual short covering. Even the chips of the factories also had short covering, which caused the sentiment inside and outside the industry to be affected. Bidding prices for all months rose step by step. By the time the market closed, the total increase was one, two, or three cents. When the market opened in the afternoon, it was quite calm at first. However, due to rumors in the market that the situation between Japan and Russia was tightening and that the situation in the Far East might change in the future, the factories again frantically covered this month, frequently and actively absorbing them regardless of the market price. As a result, outside speculation also followed closely, resulting in an abnormal situation and a rapid rise. However, distant factories still released them, which was similar to the situation at the end of the previous month. It is not known how things will change in the future. As a result, September and October each rose by four and four cents, November rose by three cents and seven and a half mils, December rose by three cents and two and a half mils, January rose by two cents, and February rose by two cents and seven and a half mils.</p>
<h3 id="e262">Futures Wheat Rises with Strong Buying Interest <a href="#e262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the futures wheat market opened in the morning, all months showed an initial flat and buoyant trend. According to foreign wheat quotations, both the US and Canada have fallen back by four or five cents. According to the usual situation, it should tend to be a small surface, but at present, because grain merchants gradually have the intention to hoard, foreign wheat has not reached the actual settlement level, and the sentiment is firm, which is why. The initial opening of this month was flat, and the distant months were less actively opened. Then, because the starch market rose, it also continued to rise. When the market opened in the afternoon, there was little change in the near term at first. Later, because the sentiment in the distant months was exceptionally good, outside buying interest was very strong, causing all months to be uniformly good. As a result, this month was four cents better, October was three cents better, November was six cents better, December was seven cents better, January was seven cents better, and February was six cents better. The spot wheat market remains calm and the transaction is still smooth. Kai Huangqiao wheat was at 3.88 yuan, Wuhe wheat was at 3.93 yuan, and Heqiao wheat was at 3.42 yuan. Yaowan wheat was at 3.89 yuan, Gaoyou wheat was at 3.77 yuan, and the lower grade was at 6.6 yuan. Liuhe wheat was at 3.61 yuan, and the lower grade was at 5.8 yuan. Huajin wheat was at 3.64 yuan, and Changshu wheat was at 3.86 yuan. Fuxin sold 5,000 bags, Huafeng sold 1,700 bags, and Xinda sold 400 bags.</p>
<h3 id="e263">Sesame Only Has Scattered Outlets <a href="#e263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>Since the new sesame was launched on the market, it has been in a state of weakness every day. The reason is that there is a lot of old stock and new goods are pouring in. The outlets only have small mills inquiring about new goods. The market situation is getting worse and worse. The old stock still has Shaobang merchants taking it, but they also hold the principle of tightening the market and not acting. Cargo owners have to accommodate, and there is no day when the market is optimistic. If you say that foreign merchants are acting, it seems to be too far away (according to Hankou delivery, foreign merchants eat 5 taels). Yesterday, it was rumored that foreign merchants were acting, but it was a rumor. As for the transaction of more than 200 bags of Shashi sesame, it was a joint sale of Houde Firm and Tongde Firm to Xiamen merchants. Yesterday, the Haizhou sesame opened for sale at 74 bags and the Jiujiang sesame at 24 bags were purchased by Shaobang merchants. Zhuzhen sesame at 50 bags and Guandian sesame at 69 bags were purchased by our street. The remaining 53 bags of Yangzhou sesame and 70 bags of Nanjing sesame were all purchased by Ningbo merchants.</p>
<h3 id="e264">Silk, Tea, and Foreign Merchants Face a Dismal Silk Market <a href="#e264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>Japanese silk is dumped in the Lyon market in France. The dumping of cheap Japanese silk is increasingly powerful, and the silk market is in a slump. Yesterday, Xinfu Foreign Firm received a telegram from the Lyon silk market. The quoted price for Shanghai white factory silk, except for grade A, can still stand, but grade B is only opening at 83.75 francs per kilogram, a drop of 1.25 francs. Converted to Chinese currency, it is only 830 yuan per bale. The quoted prices for Sichuan and Shandong yellow factory silk also fell by 1 franc each.</p>
<p>Hangzhou autumn cocoon silk is visible. Hangzhou's autumn cocoon harvest this year is relatively good, and the body is also good. Unfortunately, the price is not high. Farmers' costs are relatively high, so many self-employed individuals are contracting. Yesterday, there were 35 sample crystals of new autumn cocoon silk in Shanghai. Various silk merchants carried them to the association to display samples. It is said that the body is no less than spring cocoon silk. People say that silk sales are sluggish. The sales of American artificial silk to Shanghai merchants are increasingly sluggish. Yesterday, only Jiahu merchants purchased 18 cases of existing and futures contracts of brands such as Double Star Green Goldfish, priced from 170.5 yuan to 159.25 yuan net.</p>
<p>Overseas silk prices are falling. New York silk prices are falling, Yokohama Japanese silk is plummeting, and Japanese silk is being dumped heavily in the Lyon market. The market is extremely bleak. The failure of overseas silk telegraphs to turn the market atmosphere around makes it very depressed. Although European and American hoarders in Shanghai are trying to support the market, they are relentlessly suppressing prices. Chinese silk merchants are unwilling to sell at a loss, so the silk market is stagnant and the future is pessimistic.</p>
<h3 id="e265">Core-pulled Zhenmei Is Selling Smoothly in Europe <a href="#e265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, core-pulled Zhenmei green tea from Wuyuan, Tunxi, and other areas continued to sell smoothly in Europe. Chinese tea merchants have fewer and fewer stocks in hand, and their attitude has turned firm. The market price for goods with good leaf bottoms has risen by two or three yuan yesterday. However, due to Saturday yesterday, there was only a half-day market for ordinary Zhenmei, Needle Mei, Gongxi, and other green teas, and there were few transactions. The current tea stocks on the market are lacking goods from Tunxi, Shexian, Suian, Yushan, and other areas. Although Zhenmei from the northern Wuyuan road is slightly abundant, it will not be difficult to sell it out.</p>
<h3 id="e266">The Sugar Market Has Little Ups and Downs <a href="#e266" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c266" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">266</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market continued to be firm as the Customs Gold continued to rise. The public association's quote for 24 coarse sand white ordinary goods was 21.89 yuan, but no transaction was made. Transit goods opened at 8.1 Dutch guilders, up about 7 cents from before, and could arrive on October 3rd, opening at 8.05 guilders (foreign tax). The prices of 20 medium sand white and Dutch red were all quoted at the original price. However, there was no loading out today because it was Sunday, so no transaction was made. Taikoo sugar B was at 21.75 yuan, W was at 21.65 yuan, DY Mark was at 21.45 yuan, HX Mark was at 20.8 yuan, and China Guohua cotton white No. 1 was quoted at 20.8 yuan, but no transaction has been made yet. Chaoqing opened at 200+ bags yesterday, with the top grade being 16.1 yuan, followed by 15.9 to 7.3 yuan, and ordinary being 14.8 yuan.</p>

<p>Two batches of new cotton red dates arrived yesterday, totaling over 100 bags. However, the current sales are sluggish and they have not yet been opened, showing signs of loosening. A small number of Guangdong top-grade Beijing firecrackers and Guilin longans arrived yesterday and are expected to open at 45 yuan for the big style and 20 yuan for the small style. The market is still buoyant.</p>

<p>American tinplate, recently, both customers and manufacturers have an appetite for purchases, so transactions are good. The standard market situation is that the market is very quiet and about to move, which is quite an improvement. For example, 90-pound cargo with packaging is estimated at 17 yuan, and cargo without packaging is estimated at 16.5 yuan, which is about two cents better than before. Although it rained continuously yesterday, as many as seven or eight boxes were traded. Although there were no large-scale transactions of 100-pound cargo yesterday, there were still many retail orders. The market situation is that cargo with packaging is opening at 19 yuan, and cargo without packaging is opening at 18.5 yuan. 200-pound double-linked is opening at 38.5 yuan.</p>

<p>This newspaper has repeatedly received letters from readers asking how to read economic or commercial news. The reporter has often been unable to answer in detail because the issue involves too much. Recently, financial expert Professor Yang Yinpu has spent more than two years creating a book titled (How to Read Economic News), with a total of 200,000 words. It not only solves the reader's problem of (how to read economic news), but also provides detailed general knowledge of finance, market conditions, and various commodity market conditions. It is truly the best reference book for merchants in all industries. The book is published by Liming Bookstore on Sima Road in Shanghai and is priced at 1.8 yuan. The reporter has obtained the consent of the bookstore to offer a 25% discount on the list price to readers of this newspaper who cut out this introduction and go to the bookstore to purchase the book.</p>

<h3 id="e271">An Astonishing Message <a href="#e271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>On the recent solemn commemoration of the second anniversary (1918), in addition to publishing memorial texts in various forms, newspapers also carried an astonishing message: H.G. Wells, the British literary figure and author of the renowned (The Outline of History), predicted that major upheavals would occur in Asia's Far East within ten years, and that all of China would suffer immense devastation. The four hundred-odd provinces of China would descend into a state of extreme chaos...</p>
<p>According to our observations, the reaction of the general newspaper-reading public to this message falls into one of the following two categories: (1) those who habitually pay no attention to the domestic and international situation take this prediction to be, at best, similar to the words of a (fortune-telling blind man). They believe it is not to be fully trusted and should be listened to while observing the aftermath. (2) Friends with a fair understanding of the domestic and international situation believe that this prediction cannot be compared to the kind of predictions made by astronomers or geologists about changes to the sun in one hundred thousand or fifty thousand years, or the eventual split of the earth. The latter are merely temporary conclusions drawn from academic research, whereas Mr. Wells' prediction is entirely based on the current international situation. If the direction cannot be practically changed, and things continue to worsen day by day, then this kind of speculation is a necessary consequence, and someone would have said it long ago even without Mr. Wells' prediction. The difference is that no one before has been as categorical and vividly calculated as this literary figure, predicting what will happen in 1935, and what will happen from 1936 to 1938. Perhaps this is the difference between ordinary speculation and prophecy!</p>
<p>Seeing how countries today are desperately reorganizing their national defense and expanding their armaments, and looking back at our own domestic political disunity and the daily weakening of our national productive capacity, we firmly believe that it is very difficult to avoid the literary figure's prediction by chance. So, should we sit and wait for death, or should we immediately begin to prepare, each doing our best to contribute our abilities and intelligence to the work of fighting and resisting? But what is the actual situation? The reporter has roughly described it in the previous issue of (A Week Worse Than the Last - The Second Anniversary) rambling talk, so there is no need to repeat it. In short, the government authorities lack the appearance of striving for self-improvement, and the masses are like a heap of loose sand, full of a mentality of complacency and selfishness. Someone said: (The day the Second World War breaks out will be the day our Chinese nation begins its revival!) Even if this abstract, unfounded theory has some basis, we should also know that while a world of great chaos may provide an opportunity for oppressed nations to revive, it also carries the risk of causing an old nation to perish! The key is to see whether this old nation has made preparations for revival on the eve of the impending outbreak of the World War.</p>
<p>Mr. Xu Shanxiang, who recently returned from the United States, said in a speech on the American Revival Plan at the International Problems Research Association: (When the situation is critical, the American people can grant power to the government to act expediently, and can sacrifice political prejudices to support it unanimously. This spirit is essential for a republic, but we Chinese completely lack it. Although five million square miles of territory have been lost and the great enemy is at hand, we are still fighting internally every day, fearing only that the country will not perish.) Finally, Mr. Xu warned the people even more loudly, saying: (Within a few years, China will have a very great depression, ten times worse than today. The value of foreign goods imported last year reached over 89.1 million gold units, while the quantity of native goods exported was only worth over 41.9 million gold units, with a trade deficit of about 47.19 million gold units, equivalent to 870 million national currency. Calculated on the basis of 400 million people, each person bears about 2.2 yuan. Given China's current situation, the majority of people are so poor that they have no place to stand. How can they have the strength to take out two yuan per person and send it to foreign countries? It is inevitable that the nation will go bankrupt!) Then, after bankruptcy, will we be slaughtered by others, or will we rise up quickly to survive and prepare to resist? This is up to our own decision.</p>
<p>Thinking of relying on others and hoping for others' help is all wishful thinking!</p>
<p>The Hope of Hopeless Life</p>
<h3 id="e272">Chen Zixin, A Small Clerk in a Company <a href="#e272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>When I entered this big company among hundreds of competitors, how happy I was! Friends and relatives all came to congratulate me, praising me for having real talent and learning, and saying that my future would surely be full of hope. So I prepared my best effort and came to serve in this big company full of hope.</p>
<p>On the first day I entered, the general manager lectured us (eight people were admitted) and said: (You are all handsome young people with rich knowledge, and this company will regard you as pillars. Now, this company is like a dark room, and you are all electric lights. As long as you can work hard to make this company shine, I will definitely not treat you badly.) Ah, what a warm and sincere lecture that gave people hope! So we began to bury ourselves in hard work.</p>
<p>After working hard for a month, it was payday. Unexpectedly, I only received half of the expected salary. While I was wondering, the general manager called us together for a lecture. He said to us:</p>
<p>(You must be a little disappointed today, and I apologize to you very much for this. Your salaries were not determined by me personally, but were decided at a meeting. Several directors believe that you have all received secondary education or higher, and must be indifferent to material gain. Moreover, you are all very young in reality, and I suppose you do not have much of a burden... Shanghai is a place where people from all walks of life gather, and the good and the bad are mixed. Young people have unsettled blood and qi, and if they have extra money on hand, they will often go astray... So, on the one hand, it is also for your sake. Fortunately, there will be a performance review at the end of the year. As long as you work hard, a raise and promotion are very easy, and I will definitely not treat you badly!)</p>
<p>Alas, (indifferent to material gain), (no great burden), (extra money on hand, often go astray), after listening respectfully, we had to endure and withdraw. But when I thought of what he said: (At the end of the year, as long as you work hard, a raise and promotion are very easy...) So we were filled with hope again and continued to work hard.</p>
<p>The end of the year came, and the New Year arrived. Everyone went happily to receive their own salaries in January, but unexpectedly, the salary was still the old amount, with not a single cent added!</p>
<p>We couldn't bear it any longer, and the eight of us went to see the general manager together. Before we could open our mouths, the general manager said first: (I already know why you've come, but the company didn't make much money last year, so I'm going to have to ask you to wait a while. Because if I give you a raise now, others will be afraid to follow suit, and it will affect the overall situation, making things</p>

<p>What was there to say? The general manager would definitely not treat us badly.</p>
<p>Three months passed quickly, and the burden of life forced us to go to the general manager to petition again. As soon as the general manager saw us, he immediately said: (If you have something to say, please go and tell your director, I'm busy.) So we had to go to see the director. The director understood our intentions and said softly: (The general manager means to... most welcome, if there is another, then I dare not</p>

<p>Yan Chonglou, from Shaanxi, 25 years old, an employee of Wuzhou Pharmacy on Henan Road.</p>
<p>Every night, around eight o'clock, he returns home from the office, his spirit still so cheerful.</p>
<p>He is a young man who loves poetry, literature, and music very much.</p>
<p>Every night, without interruption, beautiful and magnificent melodies leap from the strings of his Wanhualin lute, so graceful and melodious. The telephone pole outside the window seems moved as well, its "eyes" twinkling with a serene light. The rickshaw puller on the street corner falls asleep on the footboard, forgetting his day's hard life. Music that harmonizes life's bitterness!</p>
<p>Then he begins to recite a poem along with the melody: (Sleep, grotesque world. Let the people in distress exhale a sigh of relief.)</p>
<p>(2)... (2)</p>
<p>Yang Zhongpo, from Shaoxing, also 25 years old, an employee of Aihua Pharmaceutical Society on Shandong Road.</p>
<p>Late at night, in the bedroom, all his other colleagues are sound asleep, snoring away, but he alone is quietly contemplating under the flickering candlelight, pondering, pondering. The sharp tip of his pencil dances lightly and heavily, densely and sparsely on the sixty-pound drawing paper, sketching out the outlines of various figures.</p>
<p>Elegant, harmonious colors, skilled brushstrokes, clean outlines. Although his artistic skills have not yet matured, the path to success has already unfolded before him.</p>
<p>Indeed, he has never attended an art school, nor has he received guidance from anyone with artistic experience. He relies entirely on his own research, practice, and references. He never loses heart for a moment.</p>
<p>Now, his works have been welcomed by many newspapers and publications.</p>

<p>Zhou Tianlai, originally from Anhui, a pawnshop appraiser at Yuanlai Pawnshop on Fuzhou Road in this city.</p>
<p>Whenever he has a break from work, he fumbles with his large format camera. Beautiful spring suburbs, summer evenings by the river, autumn parks, winter villages, he finds natural beauty there, treating it as the subject of his photography.</p>
<p>One Saturday afternoon, he quickly finished the things that should be done in the shop and came to ask me to go to the art school to photograph the nude human body. He was really obsessed with art. It took quite a while to pass two big homes… The woman who was to be the model was already impatient, and the atmosphere was awkward. How the chest should be positioned... After much careful lens adjustment and lighting, he finally took a picture. On the way back, he smiled and said: (This time the results will be great!) However, most of his monthly income is spent on this sort of thing. Yet he says: (Sacrificing money for art is nothing to be stingy about.)</p>

<h3 id="e276">Business Common Sense: Preparations for Starting a New Store by Zheng Lixuan <a href="#e276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>People who work in the business world generally have a hope: that after working hard for others for several years as a clerk, they will save up some capital through frugality, and in the future, they can start anew and establish their own business (as for whether this hope can become a reality, that is naturally another matter).</p>
<p>Therefore, in this context, the necessary preparations when starting a new store should be something everyone is happy to hear about!</p>
<p>The preparations for starting a new store, such as finding a location, installing equipment, stocking goods, and hiring employees, are things that anyone with a little business experience can probably understand. However, in addition to these extremely common preparations, there are a few points that are extremely important and that all entrepreneurs should know. I will select the essentials and describe them below:</p>
<p>(1) Registration: In recent years, various industries in Shanghai have organizations called trade associations. These organizations have good and close relationships with the same industry. When a store is first established, it should first register with the association, which will definitely help with the progress of the business. Secondly, the Shanghai Social Bureau has a commercial and industrial registration office, and you should also go there to register before the store is established to obtain legal status.</p>
<p>(2) Insurance: Once the registration procedures are complete, when you are starting to do things, you should pre-allocate the total amount of capital. For example, if the total amount of capital is 5,000 yuan, use 1,000 yuan for (goodwill), store base equipment, decoration, etc., use 3,000 yuan for goods, and 1,000 yuan for working capital. Then, this store should be worth at least 4,000 yuan besides cash. Once you have an approximate amount, then find a stable and reliable insurance company to take out fire insurance. Because disasters are unpredictable, fire insurance costs are limited, but the assets are already protected, so you won't suffer from unexpected disasters.</p>
<p>(3) Extraneous expenses: All the necessary procedures have been completed. At this time, there is still one very important thing that should be noted: In all levels of society in Shanghai, there is a special class called (loafers). These people specialize in finding a living by extortion and fraud. They have organizations and (colors). Naturally, when a new store is established and opened, you should try to contact them in advance and give them a good impression, so as to avoid being subjected to all kinds of unavoidable and vicious slanders when opening.</p>

<p>Ms. Bi Xiang: More than two years have passed since the September 18th Incident. Although it has now been declared over with the authorities enduring the pain, the loss of life and property to the people is unprecedented in our country. The resources of the four northeastern provinces have already fallen entirely into the hands of Japanese imperialism; even the losses in Shanghai during the war were equally huge. However, under the influence of narrow patriotism and patriotic movements at the time, several so-called (national heroes) who shook the world were created, which is truly a fortunate thing for our nation!</p>
<p>However, what exactly did these national heroes accomplish in the anti-Japanese movement? This is worth studying.</p>
<p>Originally, after non-resistance, the outbreak of resistance was an inevitable result, and it was bound to be initiated from among the lower-ranking officers and soldiers. However, when contact between the two sides had already begun, their superiors, these national heroes who did not want to resist, were still forcing them to remain calm, telling them to strictly abide by the orders of their superiors. It was not until later, when the war became a situation where they were riding a tiger, coupled with the fact that those who did not resist were deeply resented by the masses, and most hoped that those who resisted would step forward, that these national heroes transformed themselves and took advantage of the trend to engage in so-called resistance, using this opportunity to create their own position and at the same time win praise. As a result, the sacrificers were some brave lower-ranking officers and soldiers, while those who reaped the benefits were still these national heroes. What is most incomprehensible is that some national heroes once surrendered to Japanese imperialism midway, some national heroes were busy with (internal pacification), and some national heroes were also key figures in the signing of the Shanghai truce agreement. These were the greatest tasks they completed in the anti-Japanese movement.</p>
<p>In this anti-Japanese and anti-imperialist upsurge, since the national heroes have shown themselves to be so incompetent, and their actions are suspicious in every way, then why are there still people holding on to idol worship, expressing warm welcomes to these national heroes, and hoping that they can show great power? However, we must know that this is just a portion of the backward petty bourgeoisie succumbing to the impulse of narrow national consciousness, and the majority of the working masses will never believe in these heroes, because they deeply know that the anti-Japanese and anti-imperialist movement cannot be borne by a few people, let alone implemented by one or two national heroes. If we want to know what national heroes can actually do, it is that they are similarly obstructing the progress of the anti-Japanese and anti-imperialist movement. Conversely, only the working masses who are the most oppressed and exploited are the main force in the anti-Japanese and anti-imperialist movement, and only they can firmly shoulder this major task; otherwise, China will never be liberated from the oppression and exploitation of Japanese imperialism and all other imperialisms.</p>

<p>Steamboat fire hold, in the steamboat's fire hold. In front is the hot furnace fire, behind is the sooty coal pile, only cramped, stuffy, smoky, roasting: enclosing the entire fire hold. The heat, ten times worse than the hot wind blowing from India in early summer, is true, even dogs can't live there, but we have to live in it. Who wants to? But we have to in order to eat, even if we don't want to!</p>
<p>Each person manages three furnaces, nine furnace openings, using long furnace rake iron, coal shovel, coal hook, shoveling, digging, excavating the black coal, one shovel, two shovels sent to the hot furnace, while cleaning out the coal slag and sending it to the salt field... Doing like this, from the first furnace opening all the way to the ninth, over and over again, endlessly. Truly, you can't even rest for a second, otherwise the furnace fire will slow down, the (water ting) (steam) will be light, and the (Namowan)'s ham leg will be coming to your butt again.</p>
<p>Working hours are really long! The first watch is four o'clock, the second watch is another four o'clock, eight hours a day is called (on watch), in addition, you have to do two hours of coal slag cleaning work. Ah! Ten hours a day living in that stuffy fire hold. Fortunately, there is a bit of vitality, that is, the fresh wind blowing from the canvas wind funnel on the side of the chimney top, it is still the life-saving medicine for us stokers (firemen).</p>
<p>Are we people? It really doesn't seem like it, our entire bodies are being braised all day by that coal dust and heat, braised to be dozens of times blacker than a turtle, simply like the blacks of South Africa.</p>
<p>Because we are breathing in fire and coal dust, black dust, accumulated over a long time, therefore every stoker becomes a coughing-up-blood internal injury (people often call it tuberculosis) ghost. At the same time, because of the uneasy life and the heart-wrenching flames of the hot fire, they go crazy, become mentally deranged, to the point of jumping into the sea, lodging in the bellies of fish... it also happens often, how many times it happens every year among the more than 800,000 sailors is unknown!</p>
<p>The work must be done, and wages must be paid. Stoker's wages are generally twenty-five yuan (for those on foreign routes) and twenty-three yuan (for those on coastal routes), and inland river boats have as little as fifteen yuan or twelve yuan. Regardless of the whys and wherefores, (Shi Sha) when you get off the boat to work, the first thing is to deduct all of your first month's wages, then deduct two to six or seven yuan per month, in addition to expenses such as accommodation commission, likin, tea money, teacher money, student money, debt, interest payment, telephone fee (accommodation use), god's birthday fee, gifts...etc., a large number of expenses must be paid out of these twenty-odd yuan wages. As for parents, wives and children longing for your support, alas! That only gets, only gets (unfilial) and (uncompassionate).</p>
<p>Then, in the absence of a way, you want to find a way to find some (extra money), (selling yellow croaker) (smuggling passengers)? Can't, only (Namowan) can do that. Want to do some tax evasion? That also can't, the Customs is tight, the inspection is strict, bringing ten pounds of salt from Hong Kong, or shipping some copper coins from Shanghai to Guangdong, will also be subject to strict searches or investigation. No way, (extra money) is really not an economic outlet!</p>

<p>Hunan Baoqing Correspondence</p>
<p>Speaking of the Hunan XXX Textile Factory, almost all Hunanese know about it, because it is the largest textile factory in XXX. It started as a privately-run enterprise, but later the manager and factory director deducted workers' wages, not paying workers what they deserved for more than a year, which caused a worker strike. The capitalists took the opportunity to shut down the factory. It wasn't until six or seven years ago that XXX took it over, directly subordinate to the XXX authority. The factory is now divided into two departments: a yarn factory and a cloth factory. The yarn factory is divided into more than ten departments, including cotton carding, cotton cleaning, cotton blending, combing, drawing, roving, spinning, reeling, packing, and cotton picking. The cloth factory is divided into eight or nine departments, including warp yarn, weft yarn, sizing, weft yarn, heddling, weaving, and cloth folding. The factory building is made of cement and reinforced steel, and the roof is sawtooth-shaped lead. Inside, the air is constantly flying with cotton fibers like falling snow, so most of the workers suffer from chronic tuberculosis. If you are new to the factory, you will definitely feel that your breathing is suffocated by the cotton fibers.</p>
<p>There are currently around 4,000 workers in the factory, of which 800 to 900 are women. Most of the male workers have a junior high school education, but there are also those with a senior high school education, and even those with a university education. Most of the female workers also have a junior high school education. There is also a labor union in the factory, but the workers do not trust it very much, because whenever there is a conflict between the workers and the capitalists, the people in the labor union often say to the workers: Now is a time of national crisis, labor and capital should cooperate to increase production; workers must not take illegal actions, if there is anything, they should wait for the union to resolve it, etc. Thus, each request is just (waited for) like that. The union also nominally publishes a bulletin board, but in fact the bulletin board is done by the workers themselves, published every three days, the content is mostly focused on politics and worker life, and literary works are also published in each issue.</p>
<p>Workers work ten hours a day, divided into day and night shifts. The highest wage is six jiao, and the lowest is four jiao five fen. Supervisors and foremen are very brutal towards the workers; physical abuse is even commonplace for child laborers. If workers do not perform well in terms of production, they will be fined, scolded, or given a demerit; after three demerits, they will be fired. However, if female workers show some affection towards the supervisors and foremen, they are less likely to suffer these misfortunes.</p>
<p>After the workers get off work, some go to the club to play. There, various entertainment items, such as chess, musical instruments, etc., and various sports equipment, such as football, basketball, table tennis, etc., are available. Some go to the dormitory to study on their own. Some go to the after-school tutoring school established by the factory. The school has about 1,000 students, divided into five levels according to the depth of the workers' knowledge. Classes are held in day and night shifts. Each class is two hours long. The students themselves organized an autonomous association and also compiled a bulletin board, which is published daily. In addition, the school authorities also published a weekly newspaper, which is co-edited by teachers and students. The factory has worker dormitories, specially prepared for single workers to live in, men and women are separated, and no accommodation fee is charged. There is a public dining hall for eating, and the food cost is about five yuan per person per month, and men and women are also separated.</p>
<p>Based on the above, we can know that the lives of the workers in this factory are generally not bad. This is partly because the cost of living in the interior is lower, and partly because the workers in the factory already have a considerable degree of solidarity. After the September 18th Incident, they showed their own strength. They established an anti-Japanese association, organized propaganda teams, speaking teams, and fundraising teams to carry out activities everywhere. They also organized a drama club to perform anti-Japanese and anti-imperialist plays.</p>

<p>Previously, this position in the publication published (Shop Assistant Communication). It was added by this newspaper on its 60th anniversary, in view of the fact that most shop clerks and apprentices in this city have difficulties and suffer from not having the opportunity to learn from each other. Its target audience was originally limited to shop clerks and apprentices; but in addition to shop clerks and apprentices, even just in this city, there are many people who have this need. Thank you for not abandoning us, they have all sent letters to communicate. At first, we were very strict with this target audience; so that many valuable questions had to be cut off; later, on the one hand, because the questions specific to shop clerks and apprentices were very monotonous; at the same time, on the other hand, we felt that there was no reason to reject communications from readers other than shop clerks; so we gradually relaxed this target audience. Recently, the communications we have published have come from workers, from the education sector, and also from the administrative sector. In practice, it has very naturally changed from (Shop Assistant Communication) to (Amateur Mailbox). Now, in order to match the name with the reality, we have directly and straightforwardly renamed it (Amateur Mailbox). Based on past experience, we know that in addition to letters that raise practical questions about a certain event, some letters only express personal opinions on a certain issue or describe the situation in a certain scene. From now on, for letters that raise practical questions, the editor will reply to the best of their ability, and those that are universal and that the general public is eager to know will be published in this column, while the rest will be replied to directly by this column (please make your address clear in your letters). As for letters expressing opinions, those that have considerable value will be selected and published directly in this column without adding notes. Readers are welcome to discuss, hoping to establish a common belief in society. As for texts describing the current situation, except for a few extremely reasonable and extremely unreasonable ones that will be published in installments for all parties to learn from; the rest will not be answered. In short, the work from now on will focus on replies; and the published texts, except for those related to the public interest, will prefer quality over quantity.</p>

<h3 id="e282">Biography of a Famous Person: Mussolini's Childhood (Part 2) by Ge Tianwen <a href="#e282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>From the ages of six to nine, when Mussolini was studying in elementary school, he was a restless and extremely annoying child. He loved to quarrel and fight with other children, and making trouble was practically his daily routine. As a result, his scalp was often scratched open by sharp stones, and his face was often covered with crisscrossing claw marks. This wasn't the biggest problem; what was most annoying was his pair of small hands, which often stole other people's things. Once, he stole a lark from a hunter (used as bait), and when the hunter discovered it, he chased after him closely. Mussolini climbed over a small hill in one breath, ran across a meadow, and swam across a small river blocking his way. Even though the situation was so critical, he still held onto the lark in his hand, refusing to let go. As for stealing other people's bayberries and grapes, it was such a common occurrence that it was countless.</p>
<p>Mussolini was already twelve years old. Although he was still mischievous and disliked studying as always, his parents were worried about the misfortune of his impending school dropout. Life was so difficult that even the bare minimum of living could not be sustained. Forced by circumstances, Mrs. Mussolini had no choice but to compose a letter to the governor of the welfare province, pleading in earnest and pitiful words, requesting permission to grant her a small subsidy so that her son would not drop out of school. The letter said:</p>
<p>(I remember you once visited our school and gave us compliments. You said that I, who have served for a long time, should be entitled to a subsidy from the Minister of Education; your words are those of a benevolent man, please do not let them pass. Originally, I was extremely unwilling to make such a fuss easily, but this year the local market situation has become too bad. Not only is the harvest poor, but the grape seeds have also rotted. My family is in this situation, and it is foreseeable that my twelve-year-old child, who is studying well at the Royal Public School of Welfare Popoli, will not be able to continue; according to the teachers:</p>
<p>He has great prospects. If you could give me a small allowance, or teach me a way to prevent my son from dropping out of school, I would never forget it!)</p>
<p>These words, when heard by the great men, were naturally no different from the east wind passing the ear, and not worthy of their concern. So, in the end, with the governor's reply of (ignored) and (disapproved), it was inserted into the governor's office's files, never to see the light of day again. But this unfortunate answer did not discourage her; she only worked even harder to encourage her son.</p>
<p>In desperation, Mussolini's mother had to force her son to receive religious education, and decided to send him to the Salesian boarding school to study. Mrs. Mussolini felt that this was the best possible solution, as she was a devoutly religious woman; but Mussolini's father, Alessandro, strongly opposed it, because this gentleman deeply resented all the inequalities in society and became a powerful world revolutionary. In his revolutionary eyes, religion was nothing more than an anesthetic, a tool for rulers to subdue the people, so naturally he was very opposed to it. How could he be willing to send his son to enjoy this kind of anesthetic? However, in the end, he yielded to his wife's will. This was inevitable, as he had no way to get his son out of the circle of religious education, unless he dropped out of school altogether.</p>
<p>In the week before Mussolini entered school, his behavior was even worse than before. He knew that boarding school life was no different from a prisoner's imprisonment, so he simply took advantage of this time before he was imprisoned to have a good time. So he ran wildly in the streets, wandered in the fields, and jumped around in the forests and vineyards, like an untamed wild horse.</p>
<p>All the preparations for school were soon completed, which seemed like a disaster to Mussolini. On the one hand, he was reluctant to separate from his beloved parents and his three-year-old sister, Edvige, and seven-year-old brother, Arnaldo; on the other hand, he couldn't bear to part with his beloved canary, which was placed in a clean cage and hung on the window of his small room. As he packed his bags and prepared to leave, his eyes were filled with tears. He slowly climbed into the mule cart, and turned back to urge his mother to take good care of the bird.</p>
<p>The tired mule pulled the dilapidated mule cart forward on the sloping and uneven dirt road, his father acting as the driver. He sat in the cart, his mind in turmoil, and his homesickness rose and fell like the swallows flying in front of the cart. In the evening, the cart arrived at the gate of the Facaga Salesian School. The father and son silently got out of the cart, and after knocking on the door for a while, a lame and old priest who was also the principal greeted them. In the dim light, the principal touched the child's head and said with a smile: (What a lively child!) End. Mussolini's father settled everything with the principal, then kissed his son and left the school.</p>
