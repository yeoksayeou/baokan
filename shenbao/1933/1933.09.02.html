<p>（華盛頓）美陸軍總長鄧恩所擬利用公共建設經費、從事陸軍機械化與擴充陸軍航空隊之計劃、今日已由美總統下令暫緩進行、以待日内瓦軍縮會議之恊定、據稱美總統之意、倘日内瓦能商得眞正限制軍備恊定、則此項計劃將大加减削、否則仍將照舊進行、查美總統所核准之陸軍革新費共八千萬元、其中三千萬元充擴充空軍經費、餘充陸軍機械設備及改良營房等費、其中含有添置若干種侵略武器、及切實擴充防衛設備之計劃、故若軍縮會議能有結果、則此項計劃勢將不能實行、至軍縮會議形勢、據陸軍部所得消息、自六月初休會以來、各方面仍從事私人談話、内以歐洲合國間之談話居多、據聞已有進步之象、今日又接一報告、倘美國能正式保證接受設置國際委員會監督檢查軍縮之議、則法國亦將贊助美國</p>
<p>之軍縮提議、且當美代表台維斯將於日内赴歐之際而有此命令、其於軍縮亦未嘗不能有相當之影響、故此舉頗可重視、至總統此令係今日在海德公園私邸簽發、俟下令之後、即偕阿斯篤、乘游艇往新英格蘭海濱埀鈞、擬作五日之游、惟美總統在啟程前曾另簽一令、撥給陸軍部潛治河道海港經費七千萬元、俾鄧恩差堪自慰、此項工程由陸軍部工程師監督、估計每年至少可雇用民夫四萬人、關於治河部份、内有浚治密昔西比河上游至水深九呎、以利航行一項、按目下密昔西比河通航地點、　明尼亞泊里期埠爲止、外間久有溝通大湖與密昔西河之議、主張在河上游築水閘數所、向北延長通航路線、再築運河以通大湖、此次浚河之舉此亦一原因云、（三十一日國民電）</p>

<p>（東京）日政府所認爲非常時之理由、其重要者爲㈠因九一八以來、日軍閥積極侵華、此　政策將引起英美聯合軍之對日戰爭、㈡國内工農民衆之生活更加困難、爲要打開局面、多趨於共産主義運動、提倡社會革命、日認爲共産主義運動、係受俄國之嗾使、故要打倒俄國、對俄作戰爲日軍事上之一大國難、㈢爲欲遂行其侵略政策、極力擴大軍備、因軍費過多、引起極端之財政困難、此稱爲非常時之日本、政友會之五大國策、皆爲解决此三大問題之提案、其實三大困難之根本原因、在侵略政策、日政府極力隱蔽此事、舍本治末、聞政友會出身之閣員三土鐵相及鳩山文相、猶以五大國策爲不足、三土提倡創設交通省、合併鐵道及遞信兩省、節省經費、鳩山則提倡國營事業移歸官商合辦、三十五萬萬元之官辦事業、若移歸商辦、則可以開除大批人員、節省經費、如股利一分、每年可得分紅三萬萬五千元、以爲國庫之用、其實此案不過多造出大批之失職之知識份子、在實質上無補於事、據政界方面之觀察、政友會爲欲救濟財閥之窮困、欲將政府專利之事業移歸商辦、以備其一派之分潤、鳩山此種之提案、或將受法西斯派之反對云、（一日華聯電）</p>

<h3>影印四庫全書問題梓</h3>
<p>影印文淵閣四庫全書未刋珍本之事。自六月中旬敎育部令委中央圖書館籌備處與商務印書館訂立合同以來。關於採用影印底本之爭論。數月未息。文人學士。各發表其意見。報章傳載。蔚爲大觀。至於最近。北方輿論界。乃有更進一步之言論。綜其大槪。一主張依現代學術之性質。爲選印之標準。二·主張刋單行本。三·主張用石印鉛印以求省費廣布。凡此皆超越版本爭論之範圍。而以學術之普及。爲立論之根據者也。</p>
<p>重印四庫全書事件。有十年之歷史。爲求四庫全書重印而努力之人。其見解與現代學術界情形。有若何之距離。爲另一問題。而其努力不息。有足稱者。此次影印文淵閣未刋珍本。觀於六月十七日之合同。及以後關於版本問題之爭論。關係各方面。以流傳古籍。供給好古者之玩賞爲目的。而不計及普通人之閱覽。其跡顯然可見。天津益世報批評敎育部之影印四庫全書。目的乃在爲四庫全書而印四庫全書。即爭論版本之人。仍屬爲印古書而印古書。均不能謂之宣揚文化。其言亦自具有若干不可否認之眞實性也。目前情形。敎育部與商務印書館主持者。顧慮事實上之困難。表示欲維持原案。學士文人。着眼於古籍之價値。爭論所用版本。北方輿論界。則又立於一般國民之地位。别有所主張。如此互相爭持。則此事之進行。其將因而延遲乎。</p>
<p>吾人之觀察。維持原案者。與爭論版本者。或不難因張元濟兼營並進之表示。而得到妥恊路徑。惟以普及學術爲根基之一種主張。則與努力重印四庫。</p>
<p>全書者之意旨。相距過遠。似其實現較爲困難。雖然。四庫全書在今日重印。猶不能使之普遍。則中國學術界未免太落後矣。吾人願當事者對於北方輿論界之倡導有以注意及之。</p>

<p>全縣原有聯保辦公處六十餘所、單個保六百餘處、嗣以保甲長、聯主任等、多係無知分子所充當、亦即當地俗稱、必係狡滑流氓、才肯幹此坐長凳子（鄕民對保甲長之俗稱）的勾當、以故濫施虎威、魚肉鄕民者有之、每戶勒征買槍費至少三元、猶不出一收據者亦有之、種種弊竇、不勝枚舉、不堪壓迫之鄕民、亦多起而呼痛反對、同時、辦公費亦無法籌措、各聯保辦公處、均已多數酌减歸併矣、</p>
<p>民性素稱强悍、淸末推行新政、縣紳盧元弼、藉學苛捐、四鄕農民、蠭起反抗、荷鏃持刀、圍攻縣城十三日夜、聞盧革職、其圍始解、民十六、商民恊會主席傅某、商同黨部等機關、擬加附稅一元五角、農民亦譁然興問罪之師、蜂擁入城者數萬、卒殺傅某與同謀劉某、并燬其屋始罷、但人民在另一方面之表現、則又頗有雍容之態度、即若遇大小糾紛、當事人多願略備茶點或設酒席、敦聘公正人憑理解决、絶少動輒入縣府控告者、蓋非無故也、</p>
<p>出産以夏布爲最著、製造方法、先將苧蔴莖皮剝下、用水浸濕、并以竹片括去粗質、溫火烘乾、謂之「打苧蔴」、次用黃牛大糞、混入麻内、約浸三小時、取出洗淨、曝於日光下之靑草地上、俟其半乾、略洒以水、三四日後、色澤潔白、較漂粉漂白者尤艷、且不損麻之靭性、間有用石灰者、但絶不用漂粉、以免傷麻靭性、此謂「漂苧蔴」、後則「續苧蔴」、即將蔴綫根端與尖端、絲絲相續、力求精細匀稱、即可預備上織、女工續麻織麻、每好競美爭巧、雖多費時日精力、亦所不計也、</p>
<p>此間刻正推行封鎖辦法、條欵繁多、一言蔽之、與匪區斷絶一切物質上之交與關係而已、中以火油食鹽二項、禁止特别嚴密、食鹽每人規定日食三錢、五口之家、計需一兩五錢、火油則五口以下者、每戶日定二兩、六口至十口四兩、十口以上、至多不得超過半斤、若欲貯用、至多只准敷用三日、（八月十六日）</p>
<h3>萍鄉落衰之各面觀</h3>
<p>萍鄕特信、萍鄕爲贛湘交通孔道、入則贛湘公路、直達南昌、出則萍株鐵道、可過株州而抵長沙、且有安源煤礦、暢銷沿江大埠、他如夏布花爆土磁等産品、亦頗可觀、蓋向稱工商發達之區也、詎民十九年、始以大股匪共之進佔、繼以四鄕農工之匪化、連年用兵、担負奇重、富降爲貧、貧流爲匪、農村經濟、日形衰落、而商業蕭條、更呈不可支持之狀、城内各大商號、存貨裝璜、尙知力求講究、無如寥若晨星之街人、每多望望然去、偶有顧客、必爲左右店舖所爭呼、姑以夏布莊爲例、曩年銷貨、可遠至東北及朝鮮、每家批貨、日在千元以上、今則竟日不進一文者、所在多有、次如花爆土磁等、更微論矣、</p>
<p>萍鄕男女各中小學校、以及鄕村義務敎育學校等、原有七百餘所、敎育經費之收入、㈠學租一萬五千七百餘石、㈡稅契附捐、每兩得徴七分五厘、年約二千元、㈢安源煤礦公司、每年津貼八千元、今則谷租淪於匪區者、計三千石以上、安源煤礦公司、近年營業虧本、亦已停止津貼、而各校原有田租、又有被各區處各義勇隊各保甲、勒抽學租畝捐、至有帶征畝捐銀兩之事發生、僅敎局學租、買槍被扣畝捐、已達千石、基此原因、學校經費無着、紛紛停頓者、幾及三百所、乃向省府請求准予抽煤捐、每噸五分、年可收四五千元、勉以補充、詎料敎局費盡九牛二虎之力、剛將此事於前年辦好、復又惹起保衛團之紅眼、乃派兵代爲完全收用、而煤商亦料保衛團之組織、不至永久、其收捐年限、必較短於敎局、故亦樂繳之、但敎費則從此日就緊縮、不得不限制學生額數、并八折敎職員之薪金、以致小學敎師、月僅得薪八九元、生活之苦、不言可知、</p>
<p>安源距城十里許、所謀煤礦公司、創自光緒二十年、規模甚大、如運煤·篩煤·洗煤等、均用機器、且有土爐及洋爐、以燒焦炭、焦炭熱度甚高、鎔鐵甚速、普通煤每噸只售六元、而焦炭則値十八九元、全廠非流動資本約六七千萬、礦區周圍三十餘里、煤層共有十三層、每日出煤、在民八九年盛旺時、爲三千噸至四千噸、今則日僅四百噸、蘊藏量究係若干、尙未確知、有謂再開二十年、即將告罄者、有謂今已開者、不過僅及煤苗、猶未達到廣大蘊藏量所在地者、礦洞有二、一由地面横穿入山腹、隧道歧出、廣袤十數里、均有電燈照亮、電車運輸、離此十餘里之王家源及紫家冲二礦區、地下電車、可供往來、至二十里外之高坑礦、藏量極富、實業部正籌備開採、爲彼此間之交通便利計、地下隧道、亦有通聯之可能、其他一洞、名八方井、井有二孔、直徑各約八尺、相距二丈、深達一百六十法尺、出入運物、互用升降機、此升彼降、極其迅速、煤量頗豐、煤質尤佳、聞工程師云、再深入五十法尺、則更有一廣大藏量、惜二十年之大水災、已將全井富源、盡汩水晶宮中、如欲恢復、非七八萬元不爲功、昔年煤炭銷路甚暢、全廠工人數達一萬、職員六百餘、待遇均優、嗣因銷路日漸萎縮、職員已减其半、月薪除建廳所委專員可得二三百元外、餘僅得由九元至四十五元之火食費而已、工人則减爲二千、且每日僅半數可得輪流做工、工資一角、自食不敷、更無餘力以贍其家矣、考該礦一蹶不振原因、實受日煤傾銷政策之影響、蓋萍煤銷路、首供漢冶之鍊鋼、次爲沿江中流各大商埠各大工廠之燃用、現各該銷貨地、均有日煤廉價出售、且可賒用、商人大都短視、寧不唯利是趨、最近漢口日商所開商業復興紀念會、亦可藉爲此事最有力之一反證、萍煤如此、其他可知、高唱抵貨之國人、對此不知作何感想、</p>
<p>萍鄕地處贛省西陲、除西路由縣城至醴陵沿萍株鐵道附近、尙稱安謐外、其餘東南北三路、均係萬山叢疊、匪軍出沒無常、由宜春開來之汽車、每經森林山坡、不惟不敢慢行、甚且特别冒險加快、實以深存戒心也、現李匪天柱擁槍七千、以鄰封蓮花安福等縣爲巢穴、不時出擾萍鄕南路之上埠·南坑等地、近更蔓延至醴陵南鄕、北有孔匪荷寵、擁槍五千、以萬載之水源等處爲巢穴、不時由黃茅經慈化·桐木、以窺萍北、近移其大部匪衆、進踞楊岐山一帶、更沿斑竹山等地、直達萍醴交界之大屏山、以李孔二股、有企圖破壞贛湘交通之模樣也、行政區公署魏專員、謂贛西各縣、無縣無匪、主力多在洋橋、（屬蓮花）僞省蘇維埃政府分爲二、一設於贛之東南、一即設於附近、雖以萬兵進攻、彼亦敢出而應戰云、匪衆所到處所、無不標語寫徧牆壁、不勝洗濯粉堊者、間</p>
<p>有僅就其原有字句、取巧增改一二字、如云「農工專政」、則於句首加以「不准」二字、如「紅軍是爲農工自身謀利益而奮鬥」、則將「紅」字改成「國」字、望之亦殊覺儼然、他如書於窮鄕僻壤背街小巷者、雖增改亦不可能、只好聽其爲風雨剝蝕而已、</p>
<p>保甲辦法、頗爲周嚴、除舊有組織條規外、月初駐軍、六十二師師司令、又召集城區各保長聯席會議、責成保甲、認眞整理、所議條件、多至二十八欵、一戶違犯、連保即被株連、茲擇其情節較重之八欵節錄如次、㈠拒絶加盟於保甲規約者、㈡行跡可疑之人潛入時、不報甲長者、㈢遇别處來客寄宿、或家人出外經宿之旅行、及歸來時不報甲長者、㈣出生死亡、或其他事故、發生戶口上之異動時、不報甲長者、㈤塡報戶口不實、或任意毁滅門牌者、㈥拒絶編入壯丁隊者、㈦凡經分配工作、而不遵辦者、㈧應繳保甲經費、而無故拒絶征收、或無故滯納者、各戶違犯右列各欵之一者、科以四元至四十元之罰金、此外全縣錢糧地丁、聞頗繁重、</p>
<p>縣境耕地較少、食糧不敷、多由蓮花或湖南輸入、平日閑農、多從事於運煤運糧之推車業、彼等不懼匪共、而匪共聞亦不之搶擄、民風與宜春相近、若遇糾紛、通常由當事人之一方、敦請中人評論、謂之起席、再由對方邀原中人、或加聘他人複議、謂之複席理屈者擔負中人集合時之茶點與酒席費、理平則各分擔其半、近雖有區鄕鎭公所之成立、但遇民間糾紛、鮮有自動向其請求調解者、至向縣府控告、尤其少焉者矣、（八月二十三日）</p>

<h3>綁匪擄架未遂向肉票開放二槍</h3>
<p>紗業鉅子徐鹿卿昨晨遇險</p>
<p>中槍受傷性命尙不致危險</p>
<p>丨六六六九號汽車可疑丨</p>
<p>昨晨九時三十分許、靜安寺海格路問發生綁架不遂、槍傷事主案、茲將各情紀述於下、</p>
<h3>匪黨垂涎</h3>
<p>寗波人徐鹿卿、年四十七歲、家住愚園路</p>
<p>第一六七號、生有二子、長名瑞甫、現年二十六歲、幼名虁甫、現年二十一歲、均在墾業及和利銀行内辦事、徐本人在紗布交易所、任四十二號經紀人、並開設益源棉紗號、以徐生性鄙吝、加以節儉持家、故數年來、已稍具資蓄、因此引起匪黨垂涎、但徐亦早具戒心、故每日外出、必屢易其裝、甚或避道而行、</p>
<h3>突來綁匪</h3>
<p>詎昨晨九時三十分許、徐由家中步行而出、當行　靜安寺路海格路第二十七號快樂也理髮店門前、公共</p>
<p>汽車站時、路旁突來綁匪三名、一穿西裝襯衫、一衣白綢長衫、一着短衣、先由白長衫之匪上前將徐左手執住、猛力拖行、當時徐驚慌萬狀、即極力掙扎求脫、擬向快樂也理髮店内逃避、時西裝之匪一見、即上前將徐搿住、徐見事危急、即滾倒地上、</p>
<h3>開放二槍</h3>
<p>大呼綁票時、該處公共汽車待車站上適有第四十四號與六十二號兩俄籍公共汽車查票員、在站待車、聞得急促呼聲、即奔至出事處查看、並擬爲徐施救、詎被西裝之匪用槍威嚇折回、同時白長衫之匪即拔鎗向徐開放兩槍、西裝之匪、亦擬反身開放、詎子彈疊住、未曾出鎗、匪等心慌、乃即返身躍上預停路旁之租界照會第六六六九號黑牌汽車、向南由海格路飛駛而逸、</p>
<h3>性命可保</h3>
<p>當時海格路口之交通崗印捕第六七一號已接得警報、並見該車絶塵而去、追捕不及、亟拔鎗向該匪車連放五鎗、有否擊中、尙未查得踪跡、一面即返身將徐車送海格路紅十字會醫院救治、一面回報捕房、派探四出追緝、徐鹿卿自送入醫院後、由該院爲之診察、發覺身中兩槍、一中腿部、一中小腹、幸未損及腸部及膀胱、故性命尙不十分危險、子彈留在腹内、將行割治、直至昨晚十二時止、該匪車尙未發現、同時對於該車照會號碼是否第六六六九號、尙屬疑問、刻下各捕房已通知全市各警政機關恊助追緝</p>

<h3>合組社會科學研究會</h3>
<p>社會科學之研究、年内漸爲國内公私各機關所注意、頗有相當之發展、惟對於分工合作一層、以缺乏聯絡之機關、尙未能十分貫澈、中國經濟學社與中國統計學社有鑒於此、因發起中國社會科學研究委員會、以促進全國社會科學之研究、及其分工合作之效能計參加之團體、除上述二社外、有中央研究院、北平社會調查所、南開大學經濟學院、國定稅則委員會調查股、中國經濟統計研究所、交通大學研究所、太平洋國際學會中國分會、中山文化敎育館研究部、嶺南大學計政學院、軍需學校計政特班等十餘機關、該會委員、則爲馬寅初·劉大鈞·張嘉璈·賈士毅·吳晁昌·何德奎·戴克諧·黎照寰·李權時·王仲武·吳大鑒·朱君毅·張心一·盛俊·林暐·孫拯·陶孟和·何廉·蔡子民·鍾榮光·楊端六·胡適之·徐新六·周作民·等二十四人、並經互推劉大鈞爲委員長、何廉爲副委員長、盛俊爲書記、徐新六爲會計、復另聘周亞伯爲幹事·一面致函各研究機關、調查其已完成在進行中、及在計劃中之工作、並徴求各機關對於分工合作之建議等、至農村經濟研究、因各機關多在進行、已經該舉常務委員、直接調查其進行之狀况、並將調查結果、報告於全體委員云、</p>

<p>全隊十六名中途皆分離僅剩一人</p>
<p>費時一年餘走遍十數省歷盡艱險</p>
<p>中國靑年世界探險家陳亦秦、於上年六月間、由廣州出發、作長途探險之壯舉本年四月間過滬北上、迄今一年有奇、備受種種艱險近以工作已告一段落、爰於月　啓程南下、於昨日（九月一日）抵滬、休憇一二日、即乘輪赴粤返里、茲據陳亦秦君與記者談其此行經過甚詳、茲分誌如下、</p>
<h3>出發動機</h3>
<p>據陳君談、本人鑒於國人對國内各地風俗人情、素不注意、對世界大勢、更無相當認識、在此狀態之下、旣不能鞏固本身立塲、更不能在技術上與各國相競爭、結果必歸失敗、余爲强種救國、及提高國際地位起見、爰與屬宅弟妹發起組織靑年世界探險隊、加入本隊者、最初共有林燮和等共計十六人、本隊探險目的、㈠尋幽搜秘、以揭破數百年前之啞謎、㈡考察風土民情、編爲雜誌、以供世人、㈢實地攝取奇特活動影片、擬將所得貢獻於世界人土、</p>
<h3>探險經過</h3>
<p>當本隊出發赴福州時、舍弟一可、因渡橋墮入河中、傷勢甚重、於是折回廣東爲弟治撩、終以藥石無效、卒至天亡、本人等於十二月間重興壯舉、由粤而滬、而京而平、涉足十餘省之多、歷時一年之久、中因種種波折、同志畏不敢前、至半途分離、迄今僅剩余一人、中間遇險經過、述要有五、㈠爲胞弟一可之死、㈡爲惠州遇匪、同志中被擊斃者一人、財物雖掠刦一空、余仍　脫險、㈢爲海洋遇大風、船遭沉沒、本人携救生圈漂蕩三晝夜、飢無粒食、流至汕頭而獲救、㈣爲在滬被害、當本人携全國護照赴滬時、某惡徒索討護照未遂、幾遭其謀害㈤爲參加前線抗日、直至中日和議恊定簽字後、脫離軍隊、以上種種、均係冒險未遭身死之經過、</p>
<h3>今後計劃</h3>
<p>本人此行、護得各地主要産物、及古物甚多、每至一地、即歷述情形用書面分期寄粤、備將來編纂成冊、以供國人之參考、本隊工作計劃、共分五期、詳情已載諸行經各省之報章、自東北抗日以來、即本隊第二期工作告一段落此此擬回省編造報告冊後、再作第三期之保險工作、第三期行程、已擬定由香港出發、經廣東·廣西·雲南·南洋羣島·印度·尼帕爾不丹·西藏·西康·四州·貴州·湖南·而至江西爲止、預定期間爲兩年俟國内遍遊完程後、再轉赴歐洲、探險世界各國、</p>

<p>政府、核准保障專利之際、未便貿出然出示、任人參觀、以是對於前往參觀而被婉辭謝絶者、深致歉然蓋以研究之過程中、慘淡經營歷十年之久、失敗約百餘次、卒至傾家破産、始抵於成、其堅忍卓絶、百折不回之精神、實屬難能可貴、誠爲我國科學界開一新紀錄、故以畢生心血所得、在未達公開表演之時、而暫守秘密焉、現聞實業界與發明人、接洽者綦夥、乃爲招待便利起見、已在本埠公共租界九江路第二十二號三樓、設籌備處、並另設臨時製造廠、先製樣機、以資試騐定於月之上浣、招待新聞界參觀、</p>

<h3>温州航業爭潮</h3>
<p>停航海晏輪</p>
<p>將調新豐船</p>
<p>溫州航路、自招商局議開瑞平班輪以來、激起各小輪公司同盟競爭、發生海運交戰、雙方各出全力互相進攻、遂使海晏輪不幸停航、船員海員全部解雇、平增無數失業人員、今爭潮尙未已也、</p>
<p>各小輪團結招商局因溫州一路、向來航業、獨占優勢、年年可獲盈利、近自南市各小輪、添開溫州班、而兼行内地小碼頭以後、大批客貨、均被各小輪奪去、故本年舊案重提、將前郭外峯所擬之瑞安平陽綫、實行開航、以補救貨運之不足、特派局員王和淸等、到瑞平考察、準備開航、致引起南市各溫州班輪之不安、以瑞平爲内地小碼頭、招商局苟再派船行駛、則同航路小輪公司、勢將難與抗衡、必致失敗、由是各小輪公司、亦急起對付、首則瑞平班輪一致團結、次又派員至瑞平、與各客家簽訂常年包裝合同、水脚低廉、不使爲招商輪染指、</p>
<p>招商局努力招商局對於此事、亦以營業所在、决不放棄、故一面將廣濟輪入廠大修、準備開行瑞平、一面即向南市益利公司等、擬優給船價、租用其新益利等輪、使减少營業上阻力、詎此事爲益利等所拒絶、招商袛得另謀添船行駛、惟於原航之海晏輪、其速率客位等、在在較各小輪爲優、故先在搭客上進行競爭、海晏由溫來滬、衹須二十八小時、南市各小輪、則須兩日夜、故一般乘客、咸喜搭海晏、而與各小輪營業、不無打擊、由是第二次爭潮、乃又發生、</p>
<p>交通部命令交通部近日突有訓令致招商局、謂據永嘉縣各公團民衆等呈請、據稱、招商局海晏輪、船齡已逾六十年、照海輪定例、過三十年便不得航行、今招商以六十年老朽海輪、航行滬溫、乘載旅客、視溫州民命爲兒戲、應請嚴令停航、以保海面安全、此令至局、劉鴻生立即命船務科、將海晏輪停止開班、其船上全部職員、亦一律解散、除業務部分人員、實行解雇外、駕駛輪機人員、與全體海員、暫令留局、候有缺出、儘先補用、但暫時則無現職又頓增一批失業人員、　　新豐輪改航海晏停航、係受人暗中攻訐所致、招商局對於溫州航路、因此更促起當局之積極競爭、决不爲一部分人壟斷、輕易放棄、現暫派嘉禾代航外、擬將北洋航綫内新豐輪、改駛溫州綫、速率較海晏尤快、而客位更優、該輪開班後必有第三步之競爭發生也、</p>

<h3>國貨綢展昨日閉幕</h3>
<p>實部代表提出五項意見</p>
<p>希望綢緞業界加以改善</p>
<p>中華國産綢緞展覽會、爲本市商會·綢業銀行·綢緞業同業公會·電機絲織廠業同業公會·等四團體所合辦、自七月十日在天后宮橋三四樓開始展覽以來、迄今已五十餘日、該會因預定之期已滿、特於昨日下午二時、假市商會舉行閉幕典禮、事先由市商會通告各業參加、並呈請黨政機關派員致詞、到各業代表數百人、實業部及市政府亦均派有代表到塲致訓、茲誌各情如次、</p>
<h3>典禮秩序</h3>
<p>㈠振鈴開會、㈡向黨國旗及總理遺像行最敬禮、㈢主席恭讀總理遺囑、㈣主席致詞、㈤副會長報告展覽經過、㈥實業部代表致辭、㈦市長致詞、㈧演說、㈨導往參觀、㈩閉幕</p>
<h3>主席致辭</h3>
<p>首由主席王曉籟致詞、略謂、今日是中華國産綢緞展覽會閉幕的一天、我們記得在前月開幕的時候、三天游藝大會、鬨動得萬人空巷、那時天氣極熱、大家都不怕熱、來此參加、今天天氣轉凉、而來賓反不及開幕時之多、可見天下事是在人幹、幹得熱鬧、參加的亦必更多、我們這個展覽會、原由廠家及各界人士贊助、而得此良好成績、因預定之期已滿、故於今天閉幕、不過形式上雖說閉幕、我們仍是繼續努力、希望大家的熱心、切不要亦從此閉幕、中國的綢緞、是靠農村中的蠶桑、現在中國農村無出路、蠶桑業尤衰敗、危機一天深似一天、凡是從事實業的人、必首先要使中國的絲有出路、繭有銷塲、若求如此、則是吾人之責任心、將永無閉幕之日、</p>
<h3>會長報告</h3>
<p>次由該會副會長王延松報告、略謂、今日我國工商業凋敝、商品不能暢銷、由於洋貨充斥之故、至於絲綢業不振、尤爲我國工商業之致命傷、本會四團體爲推銷國産綢緞起見故約本國廠家公同籌備綢緞展覽會、請本市市長爲名譽會長、籌備期約一月之久、展覽期間共五十二天、廠家參加者百數十家、貨樣共四百三十多種、由新聞報晨報·時事新報·中華日報·上海商報、等五家出特刋、以示提倡、共費用六千餘元、現已有綢業銀行及市府等各方面挪出四千餘元、尙有二千餘元、尙待社會局等處協助、計展覽期中參觀人數、每日平均五千餘人、總計人數達三十萬人、此三十多萬人、均對於國産綢緞有深刻之印象、本擬於今日頒發各種奬品與各廠家、衹以實業部至今所有奬狀、尙未頒下、須待陳部長回京、再爲送來、由各會轉送各出産廠家、</p>
<h3>實部訓辭</h3>
<p>次由實業部特派代表季澤晋致詞、略云、在座諸君、均是推廣國産的熱心份子、惟吾人應研究國産綢緞如何不能暢銷於國外、以本人觀察、約有數端、㈠因國貨綢緞、向無劃一標準、如長短尺度恒不一致、質料亦多改變、故難得外人之信用、㈡國産綢緞本色多印花及鮮艷顔色者少、不爲外國婦孺所喜故應從花色及顔色方面改善、㈢國貨綢緞、分量太重太厚、而外人每喜質料薄而軟者㈣國人對外貿易、每多單獨行動、頗少合作、又無廣告力量以佔領市塲、此後補救辦法、應得各貨之品質價値及顔色樣子、印成小册子、俾推銷員、帶往各國、以資推銷、㈤國貨貨間接賣出者多、直接賣出者少、從别人手中轉售出去不能自己直接進行、希望此後團結起來、恊力合作、以謀國外之銷塲、</p>
<h3>市長訓詞</h3>
<p>次由市長代表潘公展致訓、略謂、本會之舉行有兩點、深値得吾人之紀念、望各保存此精神、㈠此次展覽出品、比以往不同、無論顔色質料各方面、均有進步、有許多出品、無令人不能相信是國貨、展覽的效用、可使大衆知道國貨亦有與外人嫓美者、㈡綢業銀行等團體、共同辦理此會、實可忻慰、從出産者以至販賣者、恊力合作、此種精神、爲其他各銀行所未見、此則足謂爲開風氣之先、希望此後不但銀行事業能如此、各界均應秉此合作精神、振興一切、則本會不僅展覽之性質而已、實可爲一般这模範也、</p>
<h3>綢業致謝</h3>
<p>次上海綢緞業同業公會主席魯正炳演說、略云、今天是中華國産綢缎展覽會舉行閉幕典禮、辱蒙黨政工商學各界代表、惠然蒞臨、致詞訓勉、曷勝榮幸、此次國綢展覽會、雖是四團體合辦、然幸賴市政府吳市長、社會局中吳局長、補助經費、纔可以樂觀厥成、嘉惠綢業、實非淺鮮、鄙人忝居綢緞業同業公會主席、謹代表同業聊伸感謝、今年是各界公定之國貨年、凡吾同胞、更應努力提倡國貨、以謀經濟的繁榮、現在祇言我綢緞一業、已經實現政府與人民的合作精神、就是共同舉行國産綢緞展覽會、鄙人想綢緞同業、經此一番熱烈的提倡與宣傳、直接是救濟工商、然而問接的就是救濟農村、因爲吾國農村、幾瀕於破産的地步、所以宋副院長成立之麥棉借欵、亦爲救濟農村起見、但是吾綢業一業的</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>救濟、其成效遠不如麥棉借欵的宏大、只希望同胞、凡屬服用所需、槪須採購經久耐用之國産綢緞、尤希望黨政要人曁各界領袖、以身作則、庶幾上行下效、自不難恢復昔日固有之地位、而農村經濟、亦與有相當成績云、</p>

<p>哈爾賓前出五虎女將（孫桂雲·吳梅先·劉靜貞·王淵·蕭淑苓）全國驚嘆、男予方面、有符保盧以三米五四造全國撑竿跳最高紀錄、餘如前大連中距離名將于希渭、遼寗短跑及長跑選手王銘紳吳景耀等、在最近數屆華北運動會及杭州全運會中、屢顯身手名聞全國、爲我國田經界最可紀念之人物、但自東北淪陷、諸選手身蒞　險、被僞組織監視極嚴、故彼等之消息、杳如黃鶴久矣、最近彼等忽脫離虎口、聯袂來滬求學、並擬代表上海市出席全運會、是誠可喜之事、爰將各人近况、探錄如下、</p>

<h3>學習電碼與檢騐電子管的二用機</h3>
<p>— 一知</p>
<p>喜聽或愛弄無線電的朋友們，你們希望做一個報務員，或一個無線電家嗎；則應當趕快練習收發電碼。電碼代替言語，一樣寄存於無線電裏可以傳送消息。且電碼有其特優的地方，即播送電碼的發報機，構造比發音機簡單；而傳信距離却超於發音機數倍之上。因其有這樣的特殊驚人效率，所以世界各國都利用牠來傳遞消息。欲會收會發電碼不是一件困難的事情，衹要將電碼記熟，練習收發約二三月後，必能成功。收外來的電報彷如收聽無線電話一樣的容易，且發送碼語，亦甚便利，一收一發，雖遙隔數百里或數千里之外，彷彿相處一堂，對面言語多麽興趣！</p>
<p>學習收發電碼的機通常有二種：一是利用電蟬（Ｂｕｚｚａｒ）的，一是利用成音週率振盪器（Ａｕｄｉｏ　ｆｒｅｑｕｅｎｃｙ　ｏｓｃｉｌｌａｔｏｒ）的。二者中前者的聲音較後者爲弱，音調亦不及，但亦有其優點，即價格低廉，用法簡易。至後者利用成音週率振盪器的，則需一眞空管與一成音週率變壓器，使配合適當而成振盪。在振盪線路（Ｏｓｃｉｌｌａｔｉｏｎ　ｃｉｒｃｕｉｔ）内，串接電鍵（Ｋｅｙ）一按一放，發出恰如電報一樣嗡嗡的聲音，以練習收發。</p>
<p>這學習電碼器，同時又是檢騐眞空管的二用機·電源以交流電供給，取其佔地小·耗電省，使用便利。此機裝配甚易，所需機件，喜弄，線電的同志們，除置一電鍵約需三四元外，其他東西，大槪都有，把來利用，煞是經濟。茲將所需材料列左：</p>
<p>２２７眞空管一只</p>
<p>２ｏｒ丨Ａ眞空管一只</p>
<p>電源變壓器一只</p>
<p>成音週率變壓器一只</p>
<p>電鍵一只</p>
<p>２ＭＦＤ濾波電容器二只</p>
<p>３ｏＨ扼制圈一只</p>
<p>聽筒或喇叭一只</p>
<p>四脚燈座一只</p>
<p>五脚燈座一保</p>
<p>２丨５Ｖ小電珠一只</p>
<p>挿頭螺釘及接線等件</p>
<p>各項機件配齊後，即可開始裝　。其接綫法如圖一。ＶＩ爲２２７管Ｖ２爲２０Ｉ丨Ａ管（Ｉ７１，２８０等管皆可用）Ｔ爲電源變壓器，ＴＩ爲成音週率變壓器，Ｋ爲電鍵，ＣＩＣ２爲濾波電容器，Ｌ爲扼制圈，（燒壞的成音週率變壓器，可利用其副圈代之）Ｐ爲聽筒，Ｌ·Ｓ·爲喇叭，Ｒ爲可變電阻器，Ｂ爲小電珠。</p>
<p>照圖一各綫接好後，將挿頭挿入２２。伏或１１０弗打火綫上，電鍵一按一放，漸漸將電阻减少，直待聽筒或喇叭内聽見類似電報的聲音爲止。如若聽筒或喇叭内寂然無音，必係接綫錯誤，把火綫上挿頭拔去，細查綫路有否錯誤，再將成音週率變壓器兩線頭對調以試，如仍無音，則所用的２２７管或因太舊，已失其效率，故不能振盪，試換新者一試。</p>
<p>由上原理，以試騐眞空管的振盪與否，即可知其效率之如何。其試騐方法與上相同，將新的眞空管挿上，把可變電阻减少，直等聽筒或喇叭内聞有聲音爲止。將新的眞空管拔去，把欲檢騐的眞空管挿上，照法試行，是否亦能振盪。再加高或减低電阻試之以决其效率。倘欲求效率之正確則電阻器應買一綫繞者（Ｗｉｒｅ　Ｗｏｕｎｄ）其間冠以一二三四五六等以便記讀如圖二，應用此法，也可以檢騐四極管或五極管等，衹要將Ｖ１電子管挿座上的接綫稍稍調接一下或改用電鑰，以便啓閉。其接綫法如圖三與圖四，一爲檢騐四極管的接法，一爲檢騐五極管的接法。</p>
<h3>遠程收音須知</h3>
<p>— 李元慶</p>
<p>在美國有個十七歲的少年，他用一架很平常的兩燈機，竟能收到全界的播音，（四十一國，六百九十四個電台。）但是有人用了十五燈的收音機，却不能越過大西洋。又有人在南京用礦石機，能夠聽到日本的播音，但是同地有人用八燈無極外差式收音機，却收不到上海的播音。可見收音機收程的遠近，不是全在乎收音機本身的好壞，牠和其他各方面，也有很密切的關係，本篇所述的幾點，都是很重要的。</p>
<p>㈠加高並放長天線。引入線最好能與天線連在一起，（參閱本刋第五期『改良的單根天線』）否則至少也須用錫　住。地線愈深愈好。（注意：天線愈高愈妙，但不能過長，過長則選擇性較差，同時雜聲亦愈大，最好在一百與一百五十尺之間。）</p>
<p>㈡眞空管使用一年或一千小時以上，必須更換。眞空管内部有無損壞，不以發光與否爲標準。弗貪價廉購置雜牌眞空管。</p>
<p>㈢同一牌號同一廠家的眞空管，牠的特性，也不會絶對相同，有的適用於檢波，有的却適用放大，使用時，在收音機内須輪流換挿，以期得到最完美的成績。</p>
<p>㈣各級眞空管各極的電壓，必須依照規定的數値，過與不及，皆非所宜。</p>
<p>㈤檢波管的栅漏最好是用可變的，否則也須置備數値大小不同的數枚。接收遠地播音，常用２ｍｅｇ歐姆的柵漏，便覺太小，應換用３丨５ｍｅｇ歐姆的柵漏。</p>
<p>㈥收音機加裝再生圈後，牠的靈敏度，（Ｓｅｎｓｉｔｉｖｉｔｙ）便有驚人的進展。如果再加一二級高週率放大，更有意想不到之効力。</p>
<p>㈦在聽筒一端至Ｂ十與Ｂ一間，加接一個１丨２ｍｆｄ的固定電容器，能增加收音機的靈敏度，並改善音質。</p>
<p>㈧聽筒或喇叭的靈敏與否，也有很大的關係。有許多粗製濫造的喇叭，或聽筒，牠往往衹能接收本地或是響亮的播音，微弱的音訊，是不能使牠發生聲浪的。</p>
<p>㈨收音機收程的遠近，白天不及晚間；夏季不如冬令；熱帶不及寒帶；城市不及鄕間。</p>
<p>㈩無線電波自遠地傳來，路程旣多，時易發生衰落（Ｆａｄｉｎｇ）現象，（新式收音機採用自動音量控制者，自可避免。）因此，接收遠地播音，必須要有耐心。同時，在調節方面，也要有相當的訓練纔行。</p>
<h3>簡便的天綫</h3>
<p>— 朱紫源</p>
<p>下面兩種簡便的天線，我都試過，效果和室外天線簡直沒有分别，現在寫在這裏，諸位不妨來試試。</p>
<p>甲、利用電話線作天線這方法簡便得極，衹要將電話入屋的線用一根皮線接至收音機天線柱，不過要注意的，是須在這裏串連一隻·○○一到·○○五兆分法拉特的固定電容器，否則電話要不靈的，如圖一</p>
<p>乙，利用電燈線作天線牠的連接法有三，如圖二ＡＢＣ</p>
<p>Ａ是衹用電燈線中之一根，究竟用那一根成績好，要試騐决定。</p>
<p>Ｂ是把兩根都用作天線。</p>
<p>Ｃ是不用地線。</p>
<p>這三法中我覺得Ａ法最好，Ｃ法最次。其中Ｃ須能耐高電壓，容量自·○○二到二個兆分法拉特。</p>
<p>以上兩種簡便天線，我在松江用一隻再生式單管機試時，和室外天線無甚分别，晚上也可收聽Ｋ２ＲＭ輕而淸的西樂，試騐發射機的同志，如果同時要收聽别處播音時，那末可以少裝一副室外天線，</p>
<p>如果遇到調節不靈敏的時候，可加一個額外線圈和可變電容器（請參閱Ｑ·Ｓ·Ｐ·雜誌二卷一期）這裏不多講了，</p>
<h3>短波發射機之調準法及其步驟（續）</h3>
<p>— 羅靜予</p>
<p>（丁）屏柵諧振：屏柵諧振這一種線路，也是利用電容量交連的；不過他是靠着眞空管本身屏極和柵極間的電容量（圖中Ｃ３），將屏極的電流回輸到柵極而發生振盪的。</p>
<p>因爲眞空管本身的電容量甚小，回授電能不大，故宜於一般之短波發射機。又因其電容量是固定於眞空管之内部，不能隨便調節以定屏栅間激勵之比例；故如第三圖中特置Ｃ２於栅極線路内，以爲控制。當我們進行調準時，先將Ｃ１置於半數（即刻度盤上之五十度處），然後旋轉Ｃ２由零度漸增，同時屏極米厘安培表ＡＩＰ之指數亦漸增。及至Ｃ２旋至一定度，時，屏流指數遂由最大驟然跌至零位。若Ｃ２再繼續旋轉，則屏流又漸漸增大，到一定度數時，又復由最大跌至零位，丨當此屏流下跌之點，便是我們欲獲的振盪情形最佳之標準點。但見照應用方面講來，通常爲求波長的穩定，却將柵極Ｃ２的度數略略增高，以求屏極電流高出最低數百分之十。又此項調節，在柵極電容量Ｃ２變更後，對於確定波長之Ｃ２也須知以相當的調節，否則波長便不符於原定的了。</p>
<p>至於其他的線路，因爲大體都源於這三種主要線路而來的；有些地方雖然不同，而主要的原理却可以由此類推，調準的手續，也不過在繁簡上稍有出入罷了。又在調準進行中，亦宜時以波長表在傍校騐，否則成功而不合目的，實枉爲勞神了。（未完）</p>
<h3>眞空管集錦（續）</h3>
<p>— 克銘</p>
<p>四極管（Ｔｅｔｒｏｄｅｓ）柵屏間電容有使再生過度的缺點，但可由幾種方法使牠减小或消除。一種是要用複雜的綫路和配合，使産生反作用去同柵屏間偶合的作用平衡。第二種較好的方法就是在管的本身内，儘量消除柵屏間的電容。在管内挿進一個呌簾柵（Ｓｃｒｅｅｎ）的第四個極，就能完成這件工作。簾柵是置在屏極和柵極中間，這樣就成了一隻四極管。用了這種管，複雜的路和平衡的困難都可免除了，旣然簾壓（Ｓｃｒｅｅｎ　Ｖｏｌｔａｇｏ）可以十分操縱電子的流通，那麽屏壓雖有小改變，也不足以影響屏流了。這一點在穩定方面看來是很重要的，簾極的構造並不使電子流實質的受阻，但牠在屏和柵間却設了一個靜電隔離（Ｅｌｅｃｔｒｏｓｔａｔｉｃ　Ｓｈｉｅｄｉｎｇ）。簾極的電壓是比屏壓較低的正電壓。並經一電容器支路到陰極。這支路電容器（Ｂｙ－ｐａｓｓ　Ｃｏｎｄｅｎｓｅｒ）使簾柵流或高週電流引入地中並將</p>
<p>柵屏電容減至極小。一般情形，柵屏電容平均一隻三極管的８·０ＭＭＦ，在簾柵管就可減小到０·０１ＭＭＦ，或更少。减少的結果，從簾柵管的穩定放大可以超過一隻三極管許多倍。這種管的代表是２４丨Ａ·’３２和’３５。</p>
<p>五極管（Ｐｅｎｔｏｄｅｓ）在各種無線電管中，電子撞擊着屏極有相當的速度時，可在屏極趕出一些電子。在兩極或三極管中，這種趕出的電子並不發生問題，因爲管中除了屏極本身外，沒有另外的正極去吸引牠們，總究還是給屏極收了回去。屏極因陰極電子到屏極所衝撞後放射的電子稱爲二次放射（Ｓｅｃｏｎｄａｒｙ　ｅｍｉｓｓｉｃｎ）所謂二次就是有别於陰極原來放射的電子。在簾柵管中，簾柵也有一個和屏壓差不多的正壓，這樣，就要把二次電子吸了過來，在屏壓變移低於簾壓時爲尤甚。結果使屏流減少並限止四極管屏壓的上落。</p>
<p>要免除屏流的限止，就在簾和屏間加了一個第五極稱爲　柵（Ｓｕｐｐｒｅｓｓｏｒ）這樣就成功了一個五極管。制柵平常是接在陰極上的。因爲牠對於屏極是負電位的，所以要阻止二次電子的飛射並把牠們回轉屏極，那裏是不會發生問題的在現在，五極管中制柵的設計可以分做兩種作用。在電力輸出五極管中，這制柵可以出五極管中，這制柵可以使電力輸出大而增益最高，因爲屏壓能夠有極大的上落（Ｓｗｉｎｇ）。這種管的代表是’３３，’３８，和’４７。在高週放大五極管中。制柵可以在平常的屏壓下得到高的電壓放大。事實上，屏壓可以像簾壓一樣低或竟低於簾壓而不致使這種的可能增益量十分損失，這種管可由’３４和’３９代表。管的設計把制柵也接出底座外面來，更可得倒另外的利益和應用。因爲這樣，這就可能改變加在制柵上的電壓去得到特種控制的目的。這種式樣的標準管是５７和５８，（完）</p>

<h3>損壞聽筒之修理法</h3>
<p>— ＲＦ</p>
<p>聽筒使用不愼，易致損壞；或發聲低微，或竟寂然無聲。今述其修理之法，以爲欲自行修理者之借鏡焉。</p>
<p>㈠失磁失磁之聽筒，發音輕微；補救之法，就是充磁。法取出其中之永久磁鐵，繞以十八號紗包線一二百圈，再通以六弗打蓄電池之電流約一秒鐘卽成。然後依原樣裝入，卽能發音響亮如常。（繞線接電須如圖中所示。圖中之Ｎ極，卽吸引指南針指南之極者。如無蓄電池，則以能供給大電流之乾電池或代甲電之電流亦可。　　㈡膜片損壞膜片损壞之聽筒，發音粗劣。但須換一新膜片，發音卽可轉佳。可取一同厚薄同大小之軟鐵片換上卽可。（如一時無法覓得軟鐵片，可取五十枝裝香烟罐之軟洋鐵蓋，或上等餅乾筒内亦有之薄鐵皮剪成代之。）</p>
<p>㈢斷線斷線之聽筒通電後，毫無聲息，或偶有爆裂聲。可先以電表聯以上電以察出斷處之所在。如所斷者乃紗包軟線，可以接電燈之花線將斷線換去。如斷者乃耳機中之細絧絲，可將斷線全部取去，而以四十四號漆包線照原式換入，卽可。</p>
<h3>常識</h3>
<p>— 黃鑑村</p>
<p>（十四）檢波電路</p>
<p>㈠檢波之意義：當外來電波被天綫所吸收時，天綫内必發生射電週率電流。欲使聽筒盡其收音之能事，必須先分解天綫内所發生之射電週率電流，而取其中所含之成音週率電流。司此作用者稱之曰檢波。</p>
<p>㈡檢波器；在檢波電路中，司最重要工作者爲檢波器，其功用爲檢波。檢波器之種類頗多，勃蘭利氏（Branly）於一八九二年發明一種Coherer檢波器，係在玻璃管内裝入金屬極，又於金屬極間裝入金屬粉（　與銀粉之混合物）者。當電波到來時，金屬微粒間之不完全接觸立即變成完全之接觸，利用此種作用以爲檢波，當時馬可尼氏曾利用之以作無綫電通信，是爲檢波器之鼻祖，惟此種檢波器目下已無用之者。目下最通用者有礦石檢波器與眞空管檢波器之兩種。利用礦石以作檢波之收音機稱曰礦石收音機，而利用眞空管以作檢波者稱曰眞空管收音機。</p>
<p>㈢礦石檢波器：以礦石司檢波作用者稱曰礦石檢波器。茲將礦石檢波器之作用藉上圖說明之。如圖所示，因天綫有射電週率電流通過，故在綫圈之兩端必生高週率電壓，於是電流亦向礦石流入。但流入礦石後之電流僅流一方向。是乃因礦石檢波器具有單向性（ｕｎｄｉｒｅｔｉｏｎａｌ　ｃｈａｒａｃｔｅｒｉｓｔｉｃ）之故。所謂單向性者，係電流之流通僅限於一方向，他方向則不能流通是也。如是僅有半波之電流流入聽筒，故聽筒之振動板必隨電流之强弱而振動，終必隨外來電波所含有之成音電流，動作。</p>

<h3>治河談</h3>
<p>— 淸癯</p>
<p>前天山東省的黃河，因爲冀豫兩省决口，水勢陡落、已可無虞，不料石頭莊忽决口十八處之多，水都歸入正河、以致中游狂流驟漲，竟超過最高的水位，爲本月之新紀錄，據河局長張聯甲，報告壽張范縣一帶水横過北岸金堤，已達十八吋，雖正在搶護，而尙未脫危險的時期，這種「水患」是多麽可怖啊？</p>
<p>吾想以前神禹的治水、先鑿了龍門，繼導積石，然後决汝漢，排淮泗，看他的工作順叙，實在不過順水之性，使滾滾的洪流，注入到海中罷了！而中國從前滔天的水患，因此而平，吾民得以安居，不至於大家和水族共生活，這都是禹王的偉大功勞。現在治河的官員們，吾敢膽大的說一句，呌「襲白圭的故智」，臨了危急的當兒，趕築成幾個堤防，增加幾重　岸，算已盡了人事，所以一到了秋决泛濫的時候，遂沒有一年不聽見黃河决口的消息，唉！這是「人禍」，不能歸罪於自然界，償憤憤的綴了眉，呌着是「天災」，吾恐天公有知，眞萬不會忍受呢！</p>
<p>爲什麽要怎樣說？試一繙吾們所能看到的治河歷史，遠的不論，近的講，所謂「河工」一項，不曉得當那告警的中間，要費偌大的金錢，後來的結果，是這樣？咦丨是國家的一大漏巵，而從官塲一方面來說，到反得了一大宗無可計算的巨大之利藪，這並不是吾的說話過火處，實在前人的著述昭示明確，不容諱言，後來雖有什麽防禦工程，什麽籌備救濟的計畫，可說都是急來抱佛脚，算他是「治標」還不夠，「治本」的方法，從那裏起講呢？</p>
<p>其原因，在於「不明探源」的第一步，故夏秋的交關，往往積雨伏汛，其勢滔滔一瀉千里，而况堤防坍塌的地方，又不知多少，平日沒有注意到，待至水流奔放，淹沒田禾無算，而始急電告災，你！起想，還來得及麽？第二步，若要免河患，在於「塡築」，和「開挖」，那末，又須購置最新的機器，方能收萬一的功效，徒派幾位技師，有多大力量，可以獻給受災的小民看呢？第三步，就算有了「幹員」，然而要成不世的功績，還要仰着非常的鉅欵，試問値此國幣枯竭的現政府，能辦得到浩費在一時，而利賴可以到萬世麽？所以「河患」，不是吾國目前的大問題，吾以爲也是以後的大問題，是須謀畫一個永久的治法纔是道理！</p>

<h3>美麗的黃昏</h3>
<p>— 張白鷗</p>
<p>不忍辜負這美麗的黃昏，我從蟄居了一天的斗室中跑了出來：對着將沉入於地平線去的落日，發出了蒼茫的遐想。直至它的像車輪的尖端火舌般的變成了薄薄的紅霞時，我的眼線纔從天際收回到了一處樹圍水繞的農村。那一帶農村的屋瓦上，和樹枝梢頭却堆移着層層疊疊的黛靑色的幻雲，不時的變着地球上的一切的形象。那兒有嶙峋的山巓，那兒有疊閣的層樓，那兒有猛獸的起伏，正被顧愷之的詩句：「夏雲多奇峯」說得維妙維肖。在身歷其境時體味起來，覺得詩人的靈感特别比俗子豐富，給予我們以描摹對映的喜挩。可惜我的胸中沒有一點詩汁，不然，對着這當前的美景，負起手來大可吟哦一下子呢。</p>
<p>暮色漸漸的掩上來了，然而那一輪掛在冬靑梢頭半規未滿的上弦新月，却漸漸吐出伊的淸光來。夜之神無論如何使用着它的巨大的鐵翼來遮蓋黑暗，可是總不能遮住月亮姊姊的明眸。洒在樹枝上，屋瓦上，田野，河流，山林，溪澗，等等的面幕上的，是伊的普愛的銀光。伊立在繁星之中，好像一個仁慈的女皇，接受覆戴伊的萬物的崇拜。</p>
<p>我默默的立在那裏，儘立在那裏，奔馳的思潮終不能超脫這自在界以外。新稻已熟的田野，在月光下好像是珠璣的珍域，也頗使人會聯想起海底的珊瑚礁來。木棉的紅花，像一盞盞夜行者的篝燈。陰暗中的近山之飛瀑，在月光下分外壯觀。泊在河岸大樹下的漁舟，却從窗篷裏射出一點二點的燈光，和在水涯的明滅的螢火相輝映。秋蟲已鳴起它的初奏曲，一切的一切，都在月光下幽默地展笑着。</p>
<p>一股幽淸的感覺曲然從心頭長起，在日間被鬱熱的空氣被小孩的喧譁鬧糊了的腦神經，到這時完全疏散完全淸楚了　　這樣美麗的黃昏，我實在不願再跑進低濕而多蚊子的屋裏。</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>

<p>小食譜</p>
<h3>豆腐的烹調與營養</h3>
<p>— 氷玉</p>
<p>豆腐是我生症最愛吃的東西，吃法不論简單複雜，都具有特殊的味道。簡單的吃法，譬如用嫩豆腐一塊，加小磨麻油數滴，精鹽一撮，拌匀，就很可口了。此外或用香椿頭拌芝蔴醬，或加些紅乳腐滷拌，或用鹹菜滷煮都是很簡單而且極經濟的，若用複雜的方法烹調起來，好像袁子才先生的隨園食譜中，有數十種做法，那樣做法，不合於普通的家庭，因爲要費很多的材料與手續，完全失了吃豆腐的本來意義，現在我把豆腐的經濟烹調法營養分的效用。來說一下：</p>
<p>一、豆腐的營養效用據學者的研究分析，頭腐的營養分量，水分爲八八·七，蛋白質爲六·五，脂肪爲○·三·含水炭素爲三·七，石灰爲○·五，鐵質○·○二，燐酸○·二三，鹽分○·二五，熱量四五，維他命Ｂ比較最多，維他命ＡＤ也有的，所以大凡有脚氣病眼病的人，應該多吃些，若是有糖尿病的人，天天吃些豆腐，自然而然可以治療的。現今著名的營養學者，都認豆腐爲食品中不可少的東西，其他如吃頭腐可以解酒毒，預防菌類獸肉魚肉的中毒，爲蜂　所傷時，用豆腐塗抹，能夠中和毒性，使毒質發散於外，若用豆腐洗狗貓等家畜的皮毛，能夠把皮膚的齷齪與瘢結，完全剝落，毛色也非常光潔，又把豆腐在太陽下晒乾，可以代洗面粉用，從前閩閣婦女的美容法。就是用豆腐擦面，所以面色很姣嫩的。至於選擇豆腐的方法，非常簡單，總以色白嬌嫩，用手觸之。軟滑易碎，放在口中，就能溶化的，爲最上品，硬而老的，必有苦味，且不易</p>
<p>消化，可是老豆腐與嫩豆腐，各依烹調法，而異其作用。</p>
<p>二、豆腐經濟烹調法豆腐的烹調法很多，現在我所說的，是很經濟而可口的，而且用這種烹調法食之，其營養分，比較吃山珍海味爲有益，如若不信，請試吃一個月，就覺到食慾亢進，百病消散了。㈠煎炒法煎炒的法子很多，往往不得其法，不但不適口，反把營養分失掉，所以煎炒時，應當十二分注意，煎炒豆腐中，最有益的，是一，菠菜煎豆腐，菠菜富有維他命ＡＢ，煎法；先把豆腐切成小塊，用油一瓢，等到油熱起靑烟的時候，把豆腐放下，使兩面煎到黃褐色，略洒鹽花一撮，卽加淸水一碗，用鍋蓋蓋好，等其滾起，再放下切好的菠菜，再滾一回，加醬油少許，開了鍋蓋，緩緩起鍋，大凡腸有病的人，食之很適宜的，一，蒜頭炒豆腐，大蒜頭在藥物中，本來有防病消毒强胃去　的功效，我國北方人是最喜食的，所以他們的身體非常强健，這種烹調法，也很簡單，先把豆腐切成小塊，待乾，用油少許乾炒三分鐘盛起，再把切片的蒜頭下鍋炒熟，再混入炒過的豆腐，同時撒鹽與醬油少許，料酒一瓢，蝦米數十粒，（蝦米須用開水滾泡一小時）隨手拌炒五分鐘起鍋，其他用小白菜油菜等煎豆腐，仍照用菠菜法烹調就可。㈡燉煮法、燉煮法最宜注意的，就是燉的時間要長、煮的時間要短，燉的豆腐要老，煮的豆腐要嫩，老豆腐燉得不久，不會開化，就是豆腐經過文火燉後，豆腐變成蜂窼一樣的）嫩豆腐煮得太久，就粉碎不成塊了。以上煮法，手續簡單，又很經濟，且富滋養分，因爲蘿葡含有維他命ＡＥ與鐵質極多，香　含有維也命Ｄ，普能吃素的人，就是靠豆腐靑菜的營養力呢。</p>

<h3>Northeastern Patriots Risk Their Lives to Recover Lost Territory</h3>
<p>Uprising Unfortunate Failure This Spring</p>
<p>Ling Jintang and Five Others Arrested</p>
<p>(Shenyang) Yesterday afternoon, the ban on news regarding the former Northeast Army's anti-Manchu incident was lifted as follows: At 6:00 PM on January 4th of this year, cloth soaked in volatile oil and ignited, as well as a string of explosives, were discovered on the corridor leading from the Fengtian Station building to the train headquarters. Secondly, at 7:00 PM on March 2nd, there was an incident of explosives being planted and ignited at the Fengtian Concession's water supply station, with the perpetrator fleeing. The Fengtian police exerted all their efforts to arrest the perpetrators, and finally, on the morning of April 8th, arrested the leader Ling Jintang (28 years old). The next day, four accomplices were also arrested. All were former soldiers of the Northeast Army and belonged to the plainclothes team of the 21st Route Army of the Former Northeast Anti-Japanese National Salvation Army, led by Commander-in-Chief Zhang Chuanliang. They infiltrated Manchuria last January and established their headquarters in Xinlitun. Zhang Chuanliang and his men immediately infiltrated Fengtian disguised as carters, waiting for an opportunity. They all had the seal of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Army Commander, letters of commission, and loaded pistols hidden in their pockets. However, after his party members were arrested, Zhang had already fled elsewhere. (1st Day Dentsu Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Military Affairs Commission Studies Trial Implementation of Conscription System</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The central government is gradually promoting conscription. After the Legislative Yuan formulated and promulgated the Military Service Law, the Military Affairs Commission immediately ordered the General Director of Military Administration Training and various departments of education to separately draft various separate regulations for national military conscription, service, training, and organization. These have now been largely completed. Chairman Chiang believes that since the Military Service Law and its associated regulations have been gradually completed, but all current troops nationwide are hired soldiers, it is not easy to assimilate them all at once. He intends to designate several provinces for trial implementation, and after several years of operation, expand it nationwide. The Military Affairs Commission, following Chiang's orders, convened the General Staff, Military Administration Training General Director, and various departments on the 1st to conduct detailed research to determine the trial implementation provinces and the start date.

<h3>Ji Hongchang's Troops Gather Northwest of Shangdu</h3>
<p>Jin-Sui Army Closely Blocks</p>
<p>Fang Zhenwu Requests Title</p>
<p>Xiao Zhenying Leaves Beiping to Visit Chiang in the South</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan telegraphed Xiao Zhenying last night, stating that Ji had led more than 500 of his remaining troops to flee to the Gouchaodi area northwest of Shangdu. Ji's self-defense army division, led by Xu Yirong, has defected to Song, and Ji has no real strength, only four to five hundred students from Zhang Mutao's cadre school, with no more than two to three hundred guns. They are facing extreme supply difficulties. Song ordered Zhang Lingyun, Wang Ziliang, Lei Zhongtian, and others to block them on different routes. (1st Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Xiao Zhenying left Beiping south this morning. According to reports, Ji's troops have reached a dead end and are expected to be resolved in two or three days. Although Fang has made requests, the authorities are waiting for him to eliminate himself. A telegram was received from Song yesterday, instructing him to go to Ganzhou via Shanghai to meet with Chiang, report on the resolution of the Chahar affairs, and return north in two weeks. Song will come to Beiping after the Chahar affairs are settled. (1st Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The aftermath of the Chahar incident and the reorganization of miscellaneous troops are proceeding separately. Ji's troops have approached the vicinity of Gouchaodi. In addition to Song sending Gao Shuxun's troops to pursue them, Fu Zuoyi sent a telegram to Beiping last night reporting that he had agreed with Zhao Chengzhou to concentrate the entire 1st Cavalry Brigade and the 3rd Regiment in Jiangbaotu, 50-60 li west of Shangdu, and the 3rd Cavalry Brigade in Jianhezi Sanhetang, about 60 li southwest of Shangdu. At the same time, the infantry regiments stationed in Taolin are all under Zhao's command for close blockage. Zhao sent Brigade Commander Feng to Zhangjiakou to meet with Song and request instructions on the strategy to repel Fang. Fang is still leading Wang Zhongfu's troops in the Dushikou area. Fang hopes that the central government will grant him the title of Chahar-Suiyuan Border Defense Commissioner, commanding three divisions of troops, with a monthly allowance of 100,000 yuan. The authorities have not granted his request. Currently, the soldiers of Wang Zhongfu's unit are facing supply difficulties and will soon submit. Liu Guitang has assumed the position of Guerrilla Commander commissioned by the military sub-committee, and his troops are waiting for reorganization. Hou Cheng, a senior staff officer of the military committee, is scheduled to go to Zhangjiakou again to meet with Song in the next few days to assist in all matters. Sun Liangcheng disarmed and came to Beiping a few days ago, unwilling to accept any title, and decided to go to Tianjin in the next few days. (1st Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Pang Bingxun said that Ji's troops have now fled to the Gouchaodi area, with only six to seven hundred people remaining in the team, with no more than five hundred guns, which is not difficult to resolve. Fang is even less of a problem. The only unresolved issue is Fang's title. Fang and Ji cannot cooperate at all because Ji is leaning towards the Communist Party. The reorganization of miscellaneous troops in various parts of Chahar Province is nearing completion. Once Fang's title is decided, the Chahar incident will come to an end. I am scheduled to leave Beiping and return to my defense tomorrow. (1st Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Liu Ruming's troops have been ordered to move from their original defense in Tongxian to Zhangjiakou. Liu received a telegram from Song this afternoon summoning him to Zhangjiakou. (1st Day Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>US Observes Developments in Disarmament Conference</h3>
<p>Modernization Plan for Military Equipment Temporarily Postponed</p>
<p>Atlantic Fleet Remains Stationed in Pacific</p>
<p>(Washington) The U.S. plan to modernize its army, navy, and air force has been temporarily suspended in order to observe the developments in the Geneva Disarmament Conference. (31st Day Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) The U.S. Chief of Naval Operations stated today that the Atlantic Fleet, currently stationed in the Pacific, will not return to its original station for the time being and will remain in the Pacific according to the current plan. (31st Day Japan United News Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) The plan proposed by U.S. Army Chief of Staff Douglas MacArthur to use public works funds to engage in the mechanization of the army and the expansion of the army air corps has been ordered by the U.S. President to be temporarily postponed today, pending the agreement of the Geneva Disarmament Conference. It is said that the U.S. President intends that if Geneva can negotiate a genuine agreement to limit armaments, this plan will be greatly reduced; otherwise, it will proceed as before. It is reported that the U.S. President approved a total of 80 million yuan for army innovation, of which 30 million yuan will be used to expand the air force, and the rest will be used for army mechanical equipment and the improvement of barracks, etc. This includes plans to add some offensive weapons and effectively expand defense equipment. Therefore, if the Disarmament Conference can yield results, this plan will likely not be implemented. As for the situation of the Disarmament Conference, according to news obtained by the Army Department, since the adjournment at the beginning of June, all parties have been engaged in private talks, mainly between European countries. It is reported that there has been progress. A report was received today that if the United States can formally guarantee to accept the establishment of an international committee to supervise and inspect disarmament, then France will also support the U.S. disarmament proposal. Moreover, this order was issued as the U.S. representative Davis is about to go to Europe in Geneva, which may have a considerable impact on disarmament, so this move is quite important. It is reported that the President issued this order at his private residence in Hyde Park today. After issuing the order, he and Astor went to the New England coast by yacht for a five-day trip. However, before leaving, the U.S. President signed another order allocating 70 million yuan to the Army Department for dredging rivers and harbors, which made MacArthur feel somewhat comforted. This project is supervised by the Army Department's engineers and is estimated to employ at least 40,000 civilians annually. Regarding the river management part, there is an item to dredge the upper reaches of the Mississippi River to a depth of nine feet to facilitate navigation. Currently, the Mississippi River is navigable up to Minneapolis. There has long been discussion of connecting the Great Lakes with the Mississippi River, advocating building several dams in the upper reaches of the river to extend the navigation route northward and then building a canal to connect the Great Lakes. This dredging operation is also one of the reasons. (31st Day National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the U.S. fleet's concentration in the Pacific and the misunderstanding of the U.S. Navy authorities regarding Japan's mandated rule over the South Pacific Islands, Japanese Navy Captain Negane spoke as follows: U.S. Navy Chief of Staff Rear Admiral Standley has strongly advocated keeping the fleet on the west coast of the Pacific, saying that Japan is using the name of commercial facilities to build indirect naval bases in the mandated territories of the South Pacific. Therefore, the United States must seek necessary means to prevent Japan's superiority in the Pacific. However, Japan's actions in the South Pacific Islands are necessary facilities for the development of the islands and have nothing to do with military affairs. Moreover, U.S. Major Butler, who recently inspected the area, also said so. Furthermore, since the South Pacific Islands are part of Japan's territory and are ruled by Japan, the development of the islands is Japan's freedom, and there is no need for other countries to interfere.

<h3>Japan's Financial Difficulties</h3>
<p>Economizing on Government Expenses to Cope with Huge Military Budget</p>
<p>Seiyukai's Five National Policies Can Be Said to Be Neglecting the Root and Pursuing the Branches</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Ministry of Finance began reviewing the budget for next year today. The budget for each province in 1934 is 1.42 billion yen for basic expenses and 1.45 billion yen for new business expenses, totaling 2.87 billion yen, excluding special accounting and supplementary budgets. Judging from the actual situation of Japan's finances and economy, there is no way to cope with such huge expenses. It is reported that the Japanese Ministry of Finance will review the budget based on the principle of frugality and will not approve anything other than unavoidable expenses. The Ministry of Finance's review guidelines are as follows: 1. No new businesses will be agreed to except for unavoidable expenses. If new businesses are started by saving from existing expenses, the Ministry of Finance will not object. 2. Manchurian Incident expenses will also be calculated from provincial expenses, and other military expansion expenses will be determined from a smaller amount, considering the environment. 3. Reduce agricultural relief expenses. 4. Find ways to unify similar provincial businesses and save expenses. (1st Day China United News Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The important reasons why the Japanese government considers this to be an emergency are: 1. Since the September 18th Incident, the Japanese military cliques have been actively invading China. This policy will cause a war between the Allied Forces of Britain and the United States and Japan. 2. The lives of domestic workers and farmers have become more difficult, and in order to break the situation, they are increasingly inclined towards communist movements and advocating social revolution. Japan believes that the communist movement is instigated by Russia, so it is necessary to defeat Russia, and war against Russia is a major national difficulty for the Japanese military. 3. In order to carry out its aggressive policy, Japan is making every effort to expand its military equipment. Because of excessive military expenses, it has caused extreme financial difficulties. This is called Japan in an emergency. The Seiyukai's five national policies are all proposals to solve these three major problems. In fact, the root cause of the three major difficulties lies in the aggressive policy. The Japanese government is doing its best to conceal this and is neglecting the root and treating the branches. It is reported that the Seiyukai-born cabinet members, Minister of Railways Mitsuchi Tetsuzo and Minister of Education Hatoyama Ichiro, still believe that the five national policies are insufficient. Mitsuchi advocates creating a Ministry of Transportation, merging the Railway and Communications ministries to save expenses. Hatoyama advocates transferring state-run businesses to joint government-business operation. If 350 million yen worth of government-run businesses are transferred to business operation, a large number of personnel can be dismissed and expenses saved. If the dividend is one percent, a dividend of 350 million yen can be obtained annually for the use of the national treasury. In fact, this case only creates a large number of unemployed intellectuals and does not substantively help the situation. According to observations from political circles, in order to relieve the poverty of the financial cliques, the Seiyukai wants to transfer government-patented businesses to business operation for the benefit of their faction. Hatoyama's proposal may be opposed by the Fascist faction. (1st Day China United News Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Japan Actively Manages Railways in Our Eastern Four Provinces</h3>
<p>Divided into Four Major Systems for Management</p>
<p>All Staff Replaced by Japanese</p>
<p>Jihui Railway Completed, Officially Opened to Traffic Yesterday</p>
<p>The South Manchuria Railway Company of Tokyo sent its advisor back to Japan to discuss the management methods of our state-owned railways with the Ministry of Railways. After the September 18th Incident, the Japanese side seized a total of ten of our state-owned railways, namely the Shenhai Railway, the Fengshan Railway, the Jihai Railway, the Jichang Railway, the Sitao Railway, the Taoang Railway, the Taosuo Railway, the Qike Railway, and the Huhai Railway. The Japanese side decided to divide them into four major systems for management, establishing four railway bureaus to manage them. The first railway bureau manages the Fengshan and Shenhai, the second railway bureau manages the Sitao, Taoang, and Taosuo, the third railway bureau manages the Huhai, Qike, and Haike, and the fourth railway bureau manages the Jichang, Jidun, and Duntou, etc. The heads of each railway bureau are appointed by Japanese. As for the senior staff of each railway, the first batch of 300 people will be employed by the Japanese Ministry of Railways and will go to Manchuria in mid-September to take office. The second batch will arrive successively. After the acquisition of the Chinese Eastern Railway, all Russian staff will be replaced by Japanese. (1st Day China United News Agency Dispatch)</p>

The railway connects Japan via Korea and is the most important military railway for Japan against Russia, which Tanaka Giichi and the Japanese army have strived for. Today, it is officially opened, and the Japanese are very proud of this great undertaking. (1st Day China United News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>The Issue of Printing the Siku Quanshu</h3>
<p>Regarding the unprinted rare books of the Wenyuange Siku Quanshu, since the Ministry of Education entrusted the Preparatory Office of the Central Library and the Commercial Press to establish a contract in mid-June, the debate over which original version to use for photolithography has continued for months. Scholars and literati have expressed their opinions, and newspapers have reported on them, creating a grand spectacle. Recently, in the northern public opinion circles, there have been even more advanced arguments. Summarizing them, they mainly include: 1. Advocate using the nature of modern scholarship as the standard for selecting and printing. 2. Advocate publishing single volumes. 3. Advocate using lithography or letterpress printing to save costs and disseminate widely. All of these transcend the scope of version debate and are based on the popularization of scholarship.</p>
<p>The event of reprinting the Siku Quanshu has a history of ten years. The distance between the understanding of those who have worked tirelessly to reprint the Siku Quanshu and the situation in the modern academic world is another question. However, their tireless efforts are commendable. This time, photolithography of the unprinted rare books of the Wenyuange aims to provide ancient books for connoisseurs to appreciate, without considering the reading needs of ordinary people, as seen in the contract of June 17 and subsequent debates on version issues. The Tianjin Yishi Bao criticized the Ministry of Education's photolithography of the Siku Quanshu, saying that the purpose is to print the Siku Quanshu for the sake of the Siku Quanshu itself. Even those who debate the versions are still printing ancient books for the sake of printing ancient books, which cannot be called promoting culture. Their words also contain some undeniable truth. Currently, the leaders of the Ministry of Education and the Commercial Press are concerned about practical difficulties and express their desire to maintain the original plan. Scholars and literati focus on the value of ancient books and debate the versions to be used. The northern public opinion circles, on the other hand, stand on the position of the general public and have different opinions. If they continue to argue like this, will the progress of this matter be delayed as a result?</p>
<p>Our observation is that those who maintain the original plan and those who debate the versions may not find it difficult to find a compromise path through Zhang Yuanji's expression of operating both simultaneously. However, the idea of basing it on the popularization of scholarship is too far removed from the intentions of those who strive to reprint the complete Siku Quanshu, and its realization seems more difficult. However, if the Siku Quanshu cannot be made popular even when reprinted today, then the Chinese academic world is too backward. We hope that those involved will pay attention to the advocacy of the northern public opinion circles.</p>
<h3>The Liaodong Volunteer Army is Active</h3>
<p>The Japanese Army sets fire to civilian homes</p>
<p>Cruel and inhumane</p>
<p>The Volunteer Army adopts guerrilla tactics</p>
<p>The enemy is exhausted</p>
<p>(Shenyang) According to Japanese military information, the Japanese army has actively started military operations in the Jiandao area. Starting from the 26th, the Japanese garrison in Sandaogou advanced towards Wangqing County. Because the Volunteer Army mostly adopts guerrilla tactics, attacking by night after tilling the fields during the day, the Japanese army has great difficulty coping with it. Therefore, they adopt the most barbaric means of massacre, setting fire to civilian homes. Wherever the Japanese army goes, prosperous towns are turned into barren fields overnight. Liaodong is filled with desolation and is unbearable to look at. (1st Hualian Telegram)</p>
<p>It is reported that the Volunteer Army entrenched in the Wangqing County area of Jiandao intends to attack the small cities of Jiandao. Therefore, the Daduchuan garrison, the Sandaogou garrison, and the Manchukuo military police jointly moved out to Daduchuan, surrounding the Volunteer Army's residence. More than 150 Volunteer Army members rose up in resistance. As a result, they abandoned more than 40 corpses and fled. The Japanese army then burned down more than 30 houses where the Volunteer Army lived and seized many unstable documents. (1st Dentsu Telegram)</p>
<h3>Japanese Ronin Near the Great Wall Coerce and Entice Ignorant Villagers</h3>
<p>(Beiping) A Korean from Kwantung said that the Japanese army uses threats against the villages in various counties of the war zone, and instigates Japanese ronin to enter and exit the villages along the Great Wall at any time, intimidating and enticing farmers. They often say, "If you want to protect your lives and live peacefully in this land, you should quickly naturalize to Manchukuo, quickly obtain protection documents, and the Japanese and Manchukuo armies will do their best to protect you in the future. You can also avoid all supplies such as conscripting laborers, seizing livestock, and demanding materials. Otherwise, even if there is peace and no war, you will not be able to live in peace," and many ignorant villagers have naturalized to Manchukuo. Even in villages slightly further away from the Great Wall, the above threats are applied. The ronin also deceive the ignorant people with the saying of joining the nationality or insurance, and there are various handling fees. The nationality is from one hundred yuan, seventy yuan, thirty yuan, and the insurance fee is from one hundred and twenty yuan, eighty yuan, fifty yuan. The Japanese ronin said, "Your joining the nationality or insurance matter will be reported by them, and a Manchukuo document will be issued soon. The document will also be stamped by the Japanese army, and both Japan and Manchukuo have the obligation to protect you." The people paid the fees in full because of fear, and only received a Japanese flag. In addition, there are so-called livestock insurance and other names, which are countless.

In the future, the only way to use foreign capital is to raise the artificial factory tax for both Chinese and foreign entities, and the Ministry of Industry should reward factories with 50% of the tax revenue. Because many foreigners operate factories in China, raising tariffs would be ineffective. (One-day special dispatch)</p>

<h3>Opening of the German Socialist Party Congress, Hitler Issues a Declaration</h3>
<p>Criticizing the Parliamentary Principles of Democracy</p>
<p>Implying That Federalism Cannot Exist</p>
<p>Determined to Fight Marxism to the End</p>
<p>Chancellor Hitler's lengthy declaration, written for the German Socialist Party Congress held here today, clarifies the Chancellor's future plans in general, without referring to foreign affairs. It reiterated the evils of Marxism, stating that Germany narrowly escaped a Bolshevik reign of terror at the beginning of this year, and pledged to continue the fight until those who poison the German people are completely eliminated. The most important issue today is the placement of the unemployed, which requires great effort. The declaration also criticized the parliamentary principles of democracy, stating that the will of the entire nation is the best tool for the government. The end of the declaration implied that the number of states in the federal system would be reduced, stating that the only pillar of the nation is the people and National Socialism, not the federal states. When Hitler and other National Socialist Party leaders arrived today, the audience waved swastika flags and warmly welcomed them. (One-day Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>The German National Socialist Party Congress in Nuremberg officially opened this morning. Chancellor Hitler personally attended.

Then, Captain Röhm, chief of staff of the National Socialist Party's Storm Troopers, delivered a speech commemorating the deaths and injuries of armed comrades of the National Socialist Party. Subsequently, Hess paid tribute to foreign guests, especially expressing admiration for the representatives of Fascist Italy, and stated that Germany is loyal to peace and that its only goal is to achieve security for countries that do not yet have common sense. The speech concluded by praising Hitler, calling him "the guarantor of final victory." (One-day Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>The German National Socialist Party Congress in Nuremberg discussed foreign fascist movements. The leader of the National Socialist Party in China, Hasenjuer (General Manager of Zen Cheong &amp; Co. in Shanghai), explained the situation of National Socialism and Germanism abroad. The congress decided that the National Socialist Party's foreign Germanism branch will be under the control of Hess from now on. (Hess is the chairman of the Central Committee of the National Socialist Party and presided over the congress on behalf of Chancellor Hitler before its official opening.) Subsequently, Dietrich, the director of the National Socialist Party's Information Bureau, gave a speech to representatives of the German and foreign press, saying that foreigners find it difficult to understand the National Socialist Party movement because it is not an intellectual movement but a movement from the people. He also asked the press to build a bridge between the old liberal concepts and the new concepts of the authoritarian state in order to communicate with each other and seek better international understanding. He then recounted the struggle of the National Socialist Party against the republican system established by the Weimar Constitution and the destruction of Hitlerism by the old system. Dietrich also praised Hitler, saying, "A man was born to represent the National Socialist Party movement. No head of state in any country has received such popular support as Hitler. It is said that 'faith can move mountains,' and I say that faith in Hitler can move mountains. Those who rule Germany today are neither emperors nor tyrants, but the great personality of Hitler."

<p>Hitler arrived in Nuremberg today to attend his first National Socialist Party Congress since becoming dictator. The enthusiastic welcome he received surpassed that of even Caesar in the past. The entire city was filled with flags and banners, and portraits of Hitler and swastikas were everywhere. Members of the Brownshirts filled the streets, and hotels and accommodations within thirty miles were fully booked. The mayor delivered a speech welcoming Hitler, calling him a fearless and pure knight. The entire city presented Hitler with a sculpture by the famous artist Dürer, which was engraved with the words "Knight, Death, Devil," referring to Hitler's work in destroying the devil, which is Marxism. Thousands of women came from afar, hoping to listen to Hitler's speech on the role of women in the National Socialist Party movement, but the meeting was suddenly canceled without explanation. Many of the women returned disappointed, and many wept. 60,000 members of the youth league traveled here by free transport, hoping to listen to Hitler's inspiring speech on Sunday. The National Socialist Party Congress is scheduled to open tomorrow, at which time Hitler will attend and detail the progress of the National Socialist Party movement. (31st Reuters dispatch)</p>

This move was unexpected and shows the depth of President Hindenburg's trust and reliance on Göring. According to past history, there have been only two cases of low-ranking German officers being promoted to general in one step. One was the Iron Chancellor Bismarck, who was promoted from major to general, and the other was Chancellor Hollweg, who was appointed by former German Emperor Wilhelm II. (30th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Anti-Austrian Propaganda Continues</h3>
<p>Vienna Yesterday evening, the German radio station broadcast anti-Austrian propaganda again. Fritz Krebs, an inspector of the National Socialist Party, delivered a speech saying, "Austrian officers and soldiers are forced to abuse their own people, so it is not surprising that honest soldiers in uniform flee across the border. It is not right to consider them deserters." He then attacked Dollfuss' financial policy, saying, "If Austria does not issue paper money indiscriminately, it will not be able to pay the salaries of officials." He also attacked the increase in expenditure due to the recruitment of civil defense forces in Austria. In conclusion, he said, "The National Socialist Party will go to Austria because it has an obligation to go to Austria. Once Austria falls into the hands of the National Socialist Party, the people of the Germanic race and their officials will enjoy happiness and freedom." (One-day Havas dispatch)</p>

<h3>The US Industrial Recovery Regulations Begin to Take Effect</h3>

<p>Confident That the Experiment Will Be Successful</p>
<p>(Washington) Starting at midnight tonight, the National Industrial Recovery Administration will begin implementing its grand plan to control the national industry and commerce. All industrial codes of conduct and industry regulations will take effect at this time. It is now set that the sound of factory whistles across the country tomorrow morning will be the starting point for the US President's new enterprise, and the official start of his efforts to raise prices, wages, and living standards, and to shorten working hours. Some cities will hold official celebrations at this time, such as Detroit, the center of the automobile industry. This whistle will mark the eradication of child labor in mechanical work as a thing of the past, and the official start of what many consider to be a radical and dangerous experiment by the government. Roosevelt, who is in charge of this matter, is confident that success can be expected with the support of 80% of the national industry and commerce. At this time, he is relaxing on a yacht, vacationing on the New England coast. (31st National Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Labor Issues Encounter Resistance</h3>
<p>(Washington) Officials in the National Recovery Administration have publicly disagreed on how to handle labor disputes. Three members of the executive committee have now resigned, including General Johnson's deputy, Mr. Caho, because Caho opposes the Workers' Rights labor policy, considering it provocative and contrary to the spirit of the recovery plan. Caho advocates the creation of direct labor unions, under the approval and protection of the government, to seek the interests of workers, employers, and consumers. General Johnson acknowledged today that some officials will be dismissed. The Recovery Administration is now past the experimental stage, and temporary regulations have been approved for eight industries, such as the telecommunications industry, the radio broadcasting industry, and the silk industry. The silk industry strike has been resolved through the mediation of the National Labor Board. (One-day Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) Some coal mine owners are now rejecting the new industry regulations, and the number of silk industry workers on strike in Paterson, New Jersey, has now reached 40,000. Although the work of the National Recovery Administration is still actively underway, resistance often occurs. The Public Works Department will hand over $70 million to the Army Department today for river and port engineering projects. President Roosevelt will have the power to enforce various industry regulations under the recovery plan starting the day after tomorrow. It is rumored that Ford, which accounts for a quarter of the total automobile industry, will seek another industry regulation or seek legal remedies to resist unconstitutional interference with the rights of individual employers.

<p>Two Small Towns on the Pacific Coast</p>
<h3>The Mexican Government Opens Free Ports</h3>
<p>Foreign Goods Imported are Exempt from Taxes</p>
<p>As an Experiment to Promote Commerce</p>
<p>Mexico City The Mexican President today issued an executive order opening the towns of Tijuana and Ensenada as free ports, exempting all foreign goods imported from all taxes. Tijuana is 16 miles from San Diego, USA, with a highway to Baja California. Ensenada is on the Pacific coast, about 100 miles from San Diego. It is only a small town. A few years ago, even the people of California in the United States often did not know its name. Usually, only some livestock and agricultural products enter and leave its port. The Mexican Ministry of Commerce hopes to develop the northwest coast and conduct an experiment on whether tariffs are not entirely beneficial, so it proposed this proposal, which led to today's order. Domestic workers and a part of businessmen have tried their best to oppose this move, fearing that the national industry and commerce will be monopolized by foreigners. If not, they also oppose the Mexican government's plan to generally reduce tariffs and promote commerce, but the Ministry of Commerce believes that with the Foreign Land Law in place, there is no risk of foreigners monopolizing industries. Mexico advocated generally reducing tariffs at the World Economic Conference. When this proposal failed, the Mexican President proposed that Mexico independently reduce tariffs to promote foreign trade, but there was strong opposition in the country. Today, it was decided to first conduct an experiment of opening free ports. A government spokesman said that if the implementation is not seen to be beneficial, it will not be difficult to correct it. (31st National Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Italy and Russia Sign a Non-Aggression Pact</h3>
<p>Comments from Roman Newspapers</p>
<p>All Roman newspapers have commented on the upcoming signing of the Italo-Russian non-aggression pact. They all said that the agreement is obviously a continuation of the Four-Power Pact. "The Italian Daily" said that the Italo-Russian treaty is actually a procedural agreement on security, the main points of which are similar to the agreements that the Soviet Union previously signed with other countries, namely: 1. Mutual non-aggression; 2. If one of the contracting parties has a conflict with a third country, the other contracting party shall remain neutral; 3. No economic sanctions shall be used; 4. If disputes arise between the contracting parties that cannot be resolved through normal diplomatic channels, mediation procedures shall be applied. The newspaper also said, "This treaty does not create any new facts except to consolidate the existing position and potentially develop politically in Europe which is highly interconnected." The Forum newspaper said, "Once this treaty is concluded, it shows that two countries with different ideals and political systems can engage in beneficial economic and political cooperation to maintain peace." "The Party Labour Report" said, "Since Italy recognized the Soviet Union, relations between the two countries have been extremely friendly. The new treaty cannot change this, but it can be regarded as a result of the basic principles of Italian policy, and further evidence of the Soviet Union seeking international cooperation in a peaceful spirit."

<h3>Peng Ge Meets with Italian and Belgian Envoys to Discuss the Austrian Question</h3>
<p>National 31st Paris Dispatch French Foreign Minister Peng Ge met with the Ambassadors of Belgium, Italy and Spain today. No communiqué was issued afterwards. According to well-informed sources, the Austrian issue and the League of Nations meeting were discussed at that time. This news has been verified by the Italian Selah Post. According to the newspaper, when the Italian ambassador met with the French Foreign Minister, they discussed the situation in Austria and the reorganization of Central Europe. The Paris Little Barolo Newspaper and the Morning News announced in a very casual tone that Austria wanted to increase its army by 8,000. The newspapers regarded this matter as unimportant. Austria's request for the permission of various countries is just a formality. In fact, Austria can implement it without consulting the signatory countries of the peace treaty. The Little Parisian Newspaper even said that this is a measure of emergency relief, which will last for up to one year.</p>
<h3>French Cabinet Meeting</h3>

Then, Foreign Minister Peng Ge spoke on foreign policy, especially on the attitude towards incidents occurring in various places on the border of the Cold Country. The Cabinet unanimously approved it. Then, economic and commercial issues were reviewed for a long time, and the method of distributing import quotas was discussed. This import quota method will be implemented on October 1st of this year. If our government provides equal convenience to French exports, consultations should be held to reduce restrictions. However, in order to maintain the existing commercial relationship, one-quarter of the import quota will still be allocated according to the principles previously used.</p>
<h3>South Ailian Opposition Party Forms New Party</h3>
<p>Reuters 31st Dublin Dispatch The main parties opposed to Fan Lela will merge into the Unified National Party, led by Cosgrave. This is expected to be announced within the next 48 hours. If this party is established, its main platform will be to oppose the commercial war with England. Fan Lela is currently unwilling to respond to various attacks, but this matter will undoubtedly be raised at the Administrative Council. Agriculture Minister Dr. Ryan is currently trying to find a way out of the difficulties that have lowered the price of miscellaneous grains. Ryan may implement a plan to force the management, promotion, and sale of oats and wheat at market prices. If the opposition parties unite successfully, the Fan Lela government will have to change its will and resort to the public sooner rather than later.</p>
<h3>Ecuadorian President Fully Contains the Bud of Rebellion</h3>
<p>Various Trade Unions Were Searched and Seized by the Military Police</p>
<p>National 31st Guayaquil Dispatch The Ecuadorian government used swift means to contain the bud of rebellion. The military police here, under the order of the President, suddenly searched and seized various trade unions this morning. The search and seizure was carried out by armed police, and troops patrolled the nearby streets. It is said that many documents were seized, and seven people who incited opposition to the government were arrested. It is also said that trade unions were also searched and seized in Quito at the same time, but because the authorities strictly checked the mail and telegrams, news was difficult to transmit. So far, it is only known that there was no riot. At present, the workers seem to be trying to avoid conflicts with the military police. Yesterday, workers in various industries only stopped working and returned to their homes, declaring that they would not go to work again unless the President resigned. Afterwards, although the President issued a notice to resume work, the situation this morning seemed to have not made any impression on the workers.</p>
<h3>The Penang Assembly Proposes to Improve Chinese Weddings</h3>
<p>Different Customs and Different Customs</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese in Malaya Mostly Hold Different Opinions</p>
<p>Reuters 1st Singapore Dispatch A Chinese member of the Penang Legislative Council, Mr. Lin, proposed that the government implement an order to improve the weddings of non-Muslim and non-Christian Chinese. It is said that overseas Chinese in Malaya have many different opinions on this proposal. According to the intention of Councilor Lin, it is still questionable whether the courts consider the improved wedding ceremony proposed by the new Chinese school to be legal. Therefore, it is better for the government to promulgate the wedding ceremony. Overseas Chinese born in Nanyang and those from China are paying close attention to this matter. Although many people do not oppose the old-fashioned wedding, they believe that the improved wedding should be considered legal by the court. At the same time, the majority oppose the government promulgating the wedding ceremony, because overseas Chinese in Malaya come from different places and have different customs. Not only are the wedding ceremonies very different, but also the procedures before and after engagement to marriage are different from each other. Overseas Chinese have their own local customs for hundreds of years. If they are suddenly interfered with, it should not be done by a wise man. Overseas Chinese public organizations are now planning to request the government to abide by the old rules, and the court will consult the opinions of overseas Chinese leaders as usual when there are questions about legality.</p>
<h3>Petition of Representatives of Heze Flood Victims</h3>
<p>Going to Jinan to See Han, then to Beijing</p>
<p>The Relief Committee Repeatedly Telegraphs for Aid</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: The disaster situation in western Shandong is dire. Chairman Han has repeatedly telegraphed the central government to report the situation and request relief. However, the central government's relief funds have been slow to arrive. The provincial government has specially dispatched Director of Education He Siyuan, as a representative to go to Beijing to report the disaster situation and urge the allocation of relief funds. He departed for Beijing this morning (31st) with representatives of the flood victims from Heze. Furthermore, Sun Zirang, the magistrate of Heze County, yesterday submitted a report to the Shandong Rural Construction Research Institute, detailing the disaster situation in the county, with every word filled with tears, making it unbearable to read.</p>
<p>One of the Tragic Scenes of the Floods in Western Shandong and Southern Hebei: Villages Submerged, Houses Collapsed</p>
<p>Sun also telegraphed Zhang Hanying, a member and Secretary-General of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, stating that the upstream water level was still rising and requesting that he quickly arrange for the breaching to be blocked. The Heze County flood victim representatives Ge Xiangyi, Yan Junqing, Ran Jiwu, and others arrived in Jinan on the 30th and today (31st) met with Provincial Government Chairman Han Fuqu, reported the disaster situation, and submitted a petition for immediate relief and speedy closure of the breach. According to Ge Xiangyi, "The scale of this flood is unprecedented in previous floods. More than 1,500 villages in Heze County have been submerged (800 villages completely submerged and 700 villages partially submerged). 350,000 flood victims are immersed in water. The old grain has been washed away, and the new grain has not yet been harvested. They have no clothes and no food. They want to flee but cannot because the county was originally land-based and has no boats. Now it is suddenly a vast ocean, and they cannot move, trapped in the water, crying for food. For example, when we set off from Heze this time, we first detoured southeast to Nanyang Lake, taking boats twice in between, and wading through the mud for more than ten miles. Finally, we took a boat from Nanyang Lake up the Grand Canal to Jining, a distance of 230 miles, taking six days in total. The difficulty of the journey is evident. Everywhere we looked, it was a vast ocean, houses collapsed, a tragic sight," and so on. This morning (31st) at 6:30, led by Director of Education He Siyuan, the representatives went to Jinde Hall to meet with Han. Han first asked about the situation in the disaster area. The representatives reported in detail, roughly saying, "Now the water level sometimes rises and sometimes falls, and the entire county is submerged. We have come to petition for three things: immediate relief, speedy closure of the breach, and a fundamental solution to the flood problem in western Shandong. Since the sixth year of the Republic, the Yellow River has breached in Hebei Province 15 times, flooding western Shandong each time. The reason is that the soil quality on both banks of the Yellow River in northern Hebei is poor, and those managing the river are territorial, thinking that even if there is a breach, it will not flood Hebei Province, so they do not pay much attention. This has led to repeated breaches. Without a fundamental solution, the people of western Shandong will suffer from flooding every year. The current flow is from the string ditch outside the Fanzhuang breach. Therefore, this string ditch must be blocked first so that it does not flow. After the disaster area dries up, wheat can be planted. When the water level drops in autumn and winter, blocking the breach will be easy. The flowing string ditch is only 50 li long. If Hebei Province had blocked this ditch first, there would have been no breach this time. Now, the three breaches on the south bank, the Fanzhuang breach in Changyuan County, are flooding western Shandong, the Kaocheng breach is flooding Cao County and Shan County, and the Lanfeng breach is also affecting Cao and Shan. The Chairman previously sent armored vehicles to Jining to pick up flood victims, which we are very grateful for, but because there are no boats, they cannot reach Jining and can only sigh in despair."</p>
<p>Han then replied, roughly saying, "Hearing you speak of the suffering of the flood victims, it is very pitiful. The provincial government will do its best to provide relief. When you go to Beijing, you must also speak out. I will definitely report my opinions to the central government: 1. Immediate relief; 2. Closing the breach; 3. The area south of the Yellow River in Dongming County could be transferred to Henan Province so that the authority to manage the river is unified; 4. There must be a comprehensive plan for both temporary and permanent solutions," and so on. The representatives then took their leave and boarded a train at 9:00, accompanied by He Siyuan, to go to Beijing.</p>
<p>The Relief Committee telegraphed Beijing again, requesting that national taxes be retained for disaster relief, stating: "To Chairman Lin of the Nanjing National Government, Premier Wang of the Executive Yuan, Chairman Jiang of the Military Affairs Commission, and Chairman Xu Jun of the Relief Committee: The floods in western Shandong have led to repeated telegraphs for relief. We have recently learned that Chairman Jiang has replied to the provincial government, saying that the loan of American wheat and cotton to China is uncertain and cannot be used. Therefore, Shandong Province is not allocated any cotton or wheat. Regarding the Shandong relief funds, the Ministry of Finance stopped issuing them last winter. The income from the customs surtax for the 20th year of the Republic for disaster relief was originally intended to be distributed to the disaster-stricken provinces, a certain amount of income per year, but Shandong has not received a single cent. In the 19th year, the government explicitly ordered the compensation of the disaster-stricken counties in Shandong, ranging from 20,000 to 30,000 yuan per county, but in the end, not a single penny was distributed. The national army requisitioned local areas in each county to the tune of 3 to 4 million, which the government has not yet repaid and is entirely borne by the local areas. The relief funds donated by overseas Chinese for the May 3rd Tragedy in the 17th year were transferred by the government for other purposes and were not remitted to Shandong. This is the true situation of the government's disaster relief and management measures for the people of Shandong over the years. The tax obligations of the people of Shandong to the government have been increasing over the years. For example, the salt tax alone has increased from 5 million to more than 11 million yuan. The government has allocated salt permits to various provinces to pay taxes for the lost territories in the Northeast, adding 2 yuan and 8 jiao per stone, while Shandong's own laws add 4 yuan per dan, which the central government also collects into the national treasury. This is the true situation of the government's demand for our people's tax obligations over the years. The government takes from the people for fear of not taking enough and is stingy in giving to the people. Looking around hesitantly, we knew early on that a major change would occur.</p>
<p>One of the Tragic Scenes of the Floods in Western Shandong and Southern Hebei: Refugees on the Dike Crying for Food</p>
<p>Inevitably, we will be helpless. After the Ministry of Finance stopped issuing relief funds, we repeatedly telegraphed the government, requesting that it comply with Sun Yat-sen's Founding Program, allowing us to retain no more than 50% of the national tax revenue to handle local charitable undertakings, allowing us to retain a portion to assist local relief efforts, and requesting that the 4 yuan per stone of salt permits under the Shandong Single Regulations, which is not an income stipulated by central law, be allowed to be intercepted by this province to serve as relief funds. The government found it difficult to approve, and so it continues to this day. Now, the Lanfeng breach has flooded western Shandong, affecting as many as eighteen or nine counties, submerging hundreds of thousands of people. The dead are gone, but what about the living? They cry out in desperation, begging for salvation. There is no rice to cook, and they only cry out in vain. We earnestly beseech your Excellency to have compassion for the severity of the flood disaster in Shandong Province and grant a special favor, allowing us to temporarily borrow one million yuan from the Shandong national tax revenue or allowing us to retain 10% to provide relief. We are most eagerly awaiting your orders. Zhao Xinru, Standing Committee Member of the Shandong Provincial Relief Committee, kowtows with tears." (31st)</p>

<h3>A Visit to Feng at Mount Tai</h3>
<p>Feng Expresses No Intention of Going to Beijing</p>
<p>His Daily Life Consists of Early to Bed, Early to Rise</p>
<p>His Anti-Japanese Ambition Remains Steadfast</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: This reporter went to Tai'an the other day and climbed Mount Tai on the 30th to visit Mr. Feng Yuxiang. At 10:00 a.m. that morning, Feng received me at the Xixin Pavilion near the Five Sages Shrine. Feng was wearing a white cloth short shirt and pants, blue cloth socks, and black shoes. His hair was quite long and untrimmed. This reporter first asked about Chen Gongbo's recent visit on behalf of Wang Jingwei to invite Mr. Feng to Beijing and what Mr. Feng's opinion was. Feng said that he had met with Chen on the 29th and that Chen's visit was a personal expression of concern. The so-called invitation on behalf of Wang to invite him to Beijing was entirely speculation. Recently, Sun Zhesheng and other friends have come to Tai'an to strongly advise him to go to Beijing, but he has no intention of going to Beijing recently. I then asked what Mr. Feng thought about the central government giving him the position of Water Conservancy Superintendent. Feng said that he had not heard anything about it and had no opinion to express. Feng continued to talk about how the tariff barriers of various countries in the world were increasing day by day, and people were suffering from poverty, illness, and death. Although Japan is now invading our country, it is only a perverse phenomenon, driven by the ambition of a few warlords. Its people are also bound to suffer from poverty, illness, and death. Bihana once said that occupying the three northeastern provinces of our country is like holding a bomb in one's mouth. To become a second Germany. In my opinion, it is not just a bomb, but a landmine, because our country has 470 million people, while Japan only has 60 or 70 million. Wouldn't that be a huge mess for them? Now, to seek true right and wrong, one can only find it in the countryside and towns. There is no true right and wrong in the provincial capital, let alone in the nation. They reverse black and white and replace truth with falsehood. Last year, I carved an essay on Mozi's "Against Aggression" at Xishan, and I was truly moved when I wrote it. His words were filled with emotion.</p>
<p>This reporter happened to read the anti-Japanese texts carved on the stone corridor around the Xixin Pavilion, which read, "Have you forgotten? The three northeastern provinces have been occupied by the Japanese. Those with backbone should risk their lives to take them back." The inscription indicates the area and population of the three provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang. This was carved by Feng last year. Feng then pointed to it and said, "It can't be used now, because since last year until now, more than ten months have passed, and we have also lost the province of Rehe, losing millions of people. What a great sigh!" This reporter also asked about Feng's daily life on Mount Tai. Feng said, "I get up at dawn, go to bed early and get up early, which also saves lamp oil. After getting up, I write six large characters. After washing, I eat porridge and then walk 6,000 steps on the nearby hillside until I am covered in sweat. I start classes at 7:00. Before noon, I read social sciences, and at 11:00 I receive guests. At 12:00, I have breakfast, and after a short rest, I watch the news at 2:00. At 4:00, I discuss the Spring and Autumn Annals with Mr. Fan Mingshu and others. After continuing to discuss the Zuo Zhuan at 6:00, I speak to the soldiers. At 7:00, I have dinner, and at 9:00, I rest. My family has recently come to Mount Tai completely." At this point, this reporter asked Feng to write a calligraphy. Feng immediately took a brush and wrote two couplets, one being "Saving the people knows no day of rest; Revolution knows no limit." and the other being "To be free from troubles, one must have no self; To make a good person, one must go through hardships." Underneath, he wrote Feng Yuxiang and stamped it with a seal with the two characters "San Hu" (Three Households). Feng then explained that "Three Households" was enough to destroy Qin. Now our country has 470 million compatriots. Why can't we destroy Japan? Feng's unwavering anti-Japanese ambition is evident here. Then Feng gave the reporter several copies of the publication "From Yuge River to Mount Tai." It is said that Feng is also writing books such as "From Mount Tai to Chahar," "The Beginning and End of Anti-Japanese Resistance in Chahar," and "From Chahar Back to Mount Tai," which are currently being printed.

<h3>He Bandit is Rampant Again</h3>
<p>Songzi, Shimen, and Fen Counties Under Heavy Attack</p>
<p>Xu Yuanquan Orders All Armies to Encircle and Suppress Them Forcefully</p>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: He Long's remnant bandits, previously fleeing from western Hubei to Hunan, were in dire straits. The Five Crane bandit nests were successively recovered by Xu Yuanquan's troops. It was thought that the rifles had been swept away and that pacification was imminent. Unexpectedly, after the bandits retreated to the Hunan border, they suddenly split into two groups, one advancing towards Shifeng in Hunan and the other fleeing back towards Songzi in Hubei, both being extremely rampant. The local militias in each county were not sufficient to withstand their onslaught. According to reports, Shimen and Fen counties were under critical attack, and the county magistrates were tenaciously defending them while telegraphing the province for assistance. The magistrate of Songzi County was seriously injured while leading troops to suppress the bandits, and there are reports that he has been killed in action. The rampant nature of the bandit forces can be imagined. Initially, the bandits mostly fled into Hunan via Yexiong Pass in Laifeng, intending to attack Yongshun, Sangzhi, and Dayong with full force. Therefore, the bandit suppression troops were all concentrated in that area for encirclement and suppression. He Long knew that his situation was desperate and did not dare to resist the national army. He gathered the bandit leaders Xia Xi, He Ying, Liu Kexi, He Xianggu, He Mangu, and others, reorganized the remnants of the pseudo-7th, 8th, 9th, and 3rd Divisions, as well as the guard division, training regiment, and guerrillas, into two routes, and led them east in secret, harassing Songzi, Zhijiang, Shimen, and Fen counties. This was because there were the fewest stationed troops and the weakest local defense forces there, so they avoided the strong and attacked the weak. Xu Yuanquan, the commander-in-chief of bandit suppression in the Hunan-Hubei border area, returned to Shashi from Hankou the other day. He originally planned to depart for Enshi to supervise the suppression, but now that the remnant bandits have fled east, he has stopped his trip. He has also ordered the various brigades of the directly subordinate 48th Division, as well as the independent 38th Brigade of Pan Shanzhai, the newly compiled 3rd Brigade of Jiang Zuojun, the various units of the provincial security team of Zhang Gang, and the troops of Chen Quzhen's newly compiled 34th Division of the Hunan Army, to encircle and suppress them in various ways, determined to wipe them out. According to observations by the authorities, the bandits originally had a strength of about 15,000 men. Since the division of Duan Dechang and Wang Bingnan's forces, they have no more than 10,000 men. In the current suppression by Xu's army, the bandits suffered heavy losses in the battles of Hefeng, Shihui Yao, Hongtu Xi, Xi Dui Ping, Guanyin Ping, and Wuyang Guan. Only a few thousand men remain, and spanning Hunan and Hubei, their strength is divided, making it difficult for them to withstand a major army assault. Even if they can cause trouble for a while, it is only a last-ditch effort.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of post-war reconstruction in western Hubei, Commander-in-Chief Chiang had previously instructed the provincial government to prepare for it. Provincial Chairman Zhang Qun has submitted it for discussion at the meeting, and the entire committee has decided to draft a plan. The four departments of civil affairs, finance, construction, and education, as well as the security office, are also drafting measures within their respective areas of responsibility. Generally, in terms of civil affairs, the goal is to provide disaster relief to the victims, recruit refugees, manage Qingxiang, compile and check Baojia, and in terms of finance, it is to raise and allocate relief funds, clean up taxes, unify the tax system, eliminate long-standing malpractices, and in terms of construction, it is to build roads, and in terms of education, it is to strictly implement social education, and in terms of security, such as reorganizing militias and strengthening the people's self-defense forces, and with the ultimate common goal being rural revival and social stability. However,</p>
<p>Western Hubei includes more than a dozen counties including Yichang, Yidu, Songzi, Zhijiang, Changyang, Zigui, Badong, Wufeng, Hefeng, Laifeng, Xianfeng, Xuanen, Enshi, Lichuan, and Jianshi. The area is vast, and the cost is high. It is rumored that the emergency relief funds are tentatively set at 20,000 yuan, which is truly inadequate. Even the work-relief funds are only using the 150,000 yuan allocated by the headquarters, which is also likely to be insufficient. Therefore, the issue of funds will require a great deal of planning.

<h3>Inspection Record of Jiangxi, Anhui, Hunan, and Hubei by Our Newspaper's Special Correspondent Ren An</h3>
<p>Oppressive Taxes and Miscellaneous Levies and the Blockade of Bandit Areas</p>
<p>Special Dispatch from Yichun: The bandit situation in Yichun is still quite serious, so frequent taxes are unavoidable. According to what Liu District Chief of the First District and Ouyang Yuanren said, the amount of burden borne by the people is always proportional to the distance from the bandit area. The closer to the bandit area, the more severely they are harmed by the bandits, and the greater the responsibility they bear for assisting in the suppression. Taking the grain tax in each district as an example, the First District, near the city, is located in a safe area, and the tax is calculated as 4 yuan for rice converted into cash, 3 yuan for land tax per liang, and surcharges of 9 jiao for education, construction, and autonomy, 1 jiao for handling fees, 6 yuan for defense funds, and 3 yuan for volunteer fees, totaling 17 yuan. In other districts, some pay more than 20 yuan. The Fifth District and others pay almost 40 yuan. The Sixth District is entirely a bandit area (the county Soviet of the bandit army is located in Cihua Town in that district. All the expenses required by the defense regiment and volunteers, the so-called "wool comes from the sheep's back," are generally levied by force from the banditized people. In total, the annual expenses for volunteers, etc., levied along with the grain in the First, Second, Third, and Fourth Districts are about 13,000 to 15,000 yuan, more than 15,000 yuan in the Eighth District, more than 20,000 yuan in the Seventh District, more than 30,000 yuan in the Fifth District, and uncertain in the Sixth District. On average, one liang per ding (labor), accounting for about 12 mu of land, can harvest 400 buckets of grain.</p>
<p>The landlord can collect 200 buckets of rent, worth 50 to 60 yuan. After paying the regular grain tax and surcharges, there is very little left. In addition, they must be subject to the same donations as tenants for building roads and repairing bridges. There are few who are not skinned alive. In the past, people wanted to achieve peace in the world, selling knives and buying cattle. Now, the general farmers who are suffering from soldiers, bandits, and taxes must sell cattle and buy knives to seek salvation. Reflecting on the past and present, I cannot help but feel emotional.</p>
<p>The county originally had more than 60 joint security offices and more than 600 individual security offices. Later, because most of the Baojia heads and Lianren (joint security chiefs) were ignorant and foolish people, also known locally as "they must be cunning rogues to be willing to do this job of sitting on benches" (the common name for Baojia heads among the villagers), they abused their power and exploited the villagers. Some levied gun-buying fees of at least 3 yuan per household without even issuing a receipt. Various malpractices are too numerous to mention. The villagers who could not bear the oppression rose up to protest and cry out in pain. At the same time, office expenses could not be raised, and most of the joint security offices have been reduced and merged.</p>
<p>The people have always been known to be strong and brave. At the end of the Qing Dynasty, when the new policies were being implemented, Lu Yuanbi, a local gentry, levied taxes under the guise of education. The farmers in the four villages rose up in rebellion, carrying spears and knives, besieging the county seat for thirteen days and nights. When they heard that Lu had been dismissed, the siege was lifted. In the 16th year of the Republic, Fu, the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, conspired with the Party headquarters and other organizations to add a surcharge of 1 yuan and 5 jiao. The farmers also rioted and sent an army of retribution, swarming into the city in tens of thousands. In the end, they killed Fu and his accomplice Liu and burned down their houses before stopping. However, the people's performance on the other hand is quite generous. That is, in the event of major and minor disputes, the parties are often willing to prepare refreshments or set up a banquet, urging fair people to resolve the matter fairly, and rarely resort to suing in the county government. It is not without reason.</p>
<p>Ramie cloth is the most famous product. The method of manufacture is to first peel off the bast of the ramie stalk, soak it in water, and scrape off the coarse material with bamboo strips. Dry it over a gentle fire, which is called "beating ramie." Then, mix yellow cattle dung into the ramie for about three hours, take it out, wash it clean, and expose it to the sun on the green grass. After it is half-dry, sprinkle it with water slightly. After three or four days, the color is clean and white, even more beautiful than that bleached with bleaching powder, and it does not damage the toughness of the ramie. Some people use lime, but absolutely no bleaching powder is used, so as not to damage the toughness of the ramie. This is called "bleaching ramie." Then, "continuing ramie" is to meticulously and evenly connect the roots and tips of the ramie thread, preparing it for weaving. The female workers compete with each other in skill and beauty in continuing and weaving ramie, and they do not care about the time and effort it takes.</p>
<p>The blockade is being implemented here, with many terms and clauses. In a word, it is to sever all material exchanges and relations with the bandit area. Among them, kerosene and salt are particularly strictly prohibited. Each person is prescribed to eat three qian of salt per day. A family of five needs one liang and five qian. For kerosene, a household with five or fewer people is limited to two liang per day, six to ten people are limited to four liang, and more than ten people cannot exceed half a jin at most. If you want to store it, you are only allowed to store enough for three days. (August 16th)</p>
<h3>Various Perspectives on the Decline of Pingxiang</h3>
<p>Special Dispatch from Pingxiang: Pingxiang is a vital transportation hub between Jiangxi and Hunan provinces. To the west lies the Jiangxi-Hunan highway, leading directly to Nanchang; to the east is the Pingxiang-Zhuzhou railway, connecting to Changsha via Zhuzhou. Moreover, it boasts the Anyuan Coal Mine, whose products sell well in major ports along the Yangtze River. Other products such as Xia cloth, fireworks, and earthenware are also quite notable. It used to be known as a region with thriving industry and commerce. However, since 1930, the area has been plagued by the occupation of large bands of communist bandits, followed by the "banditization" of peasants and workers in the surrounding countryside. Years of military campaigns have imposed unbearable burdens, turning the wealthy into the poor, and the poor into bandits. The rural economy has been declining daily, and the commercial slump is becoming unsustainable. The major businesses in the city still strive to maintain their inventory and displays, but the few customers on the streets often just look and leave. When there are occasional customers, the surrounding shops compete to attract them. Taking Xia cloth shops as an example, in previous years, sales extended as far as the Northeast and Korea, with each store selling over a thousand yuan per day. Now, many shops do not make a single sale all day. The situation is even worse for fireworks, earthenware, and other products.</p>
<p>There used to be over 700 elementary and secondary schools for both boys and girls in Pingxiang, as well as rural compulsory education schools. The sources of educational funding were: (1) over 15,700 "shi" (a unit of dry measure, about 100 liters) of school land rent, (2) a surcharge on deed taxes, collecting 7.5 "li" (a unit of currency) per tael, amounting to about 2,000 yuan per year, (3) an annual subsidy of 8,000 yuan from the Anyuan Coal Mine Company. Now, over 3,000 "shi" of grain rent has fallen into bandit-controlled areas. The Anyuan Coal Mine Company has also stopped its subsidy due to recent operating losses. Furthermore, the original school land rent has been forcibly extracted by various district offices, volunteer corps, and Baojia (local security) units, even to the point of seizing silver from the land rent collection. The Education Bureau's school land rent used to buy guns, and the deducted land rent has already reached 1,000 "shi." Due to these reasons, school funding is lacking, and nearly 300 schools have been forced to close. Consequently, a request was made to the provincial government for permission to levy a coal tax of five cents per ton, which could generate 4,000 to 5,000 yuan per year to supplement the funding. However, after the Education Bureau had spent tremendous effort to get this approved the year before last, it aroused the envy of the Security Regiment, which then sent troops to take over the collection entirely. The coal merchants also anticipated that the Security Regiment's organization would not be permanent, and its term for collecting the tax would be shorter than the Education Bureau's, so they were happy to pay it. As a result, educational funding has been steadily shrinking, forcing the restriction of student enrollment and an 80% reduction in teachers' salaries. Elementary school teachers now earn only eight or nine yuan per month, and their living conditions are obviously dire.</p>
<p>Anyuan is located about ten "li" (a Chinese unit of distance, about 0.5 km) from the city. The Anyuan Coal Mine Company was founded in the twentieth year of the Guangxu Emperor's reign (1894) and is a large operation. Coal transportation, screening, and washing are all done by machines. It also has both native and foreign furnaces for producing coke. Coke has a very high temperature and melts iron very quickly. Ordinary coal sells for only six yuan per ton, while coke is worth eighteen or nineteen yuan. The total fixed assets of the plant are about six or seven million yuan. The mining area covers over thirty "li," and there are thirteen coal seams in total. During its peak in 1919 and 1920, the daily output was 3,000 to 4,000 tons, but now it is only 400 tons. The total reserves are not yet precisely known. Some say that it will be exhausted in another twenty years, while others say that what has been mined so far is only the coal outcrop, and the vast reserves have not yet been reached. There are two mine entrances. One goes horizontally into the mountain, with tunnels branching out for dozens of "li." All are lit by electric lights and use electric trains for transportation. In the Wangjiayuan and Zijia Chong mining areas, more than ten "li" away, underground electric trains are available for transportation. The Gaokeng mine, twenty "li" away, has extremely rich reserves, and the Ministry of Industry is preparing to exploit it. For the convenience of transportation between them, underground tunnels may also be connected. The other mine, called Bafangjing, has two shafts, each about eight feet in diameter, twenty feet apart, and 160 "fa chi" (a unit of length) deep. Entry and exit are done using elevators, which move up and down, very quickly. The coal reserves are abundant, and the coal quality is excellent. Engineers say that if they go another fifty "fa chi" deeper, there will be even larger reserves. Unfortunately, the great flood of 1931 completely submerged the entire mine's resources. To restore it, it would cost no less than seventy or eighty thousand yuan. In the past, coal sales were very strong, and the plant had 10,000 workers and over 600 staff members, all with good pay. However, as sales gradually declined, the number of staff members has been reduced by half. Besides the commissioners appointed by the construction department, who can earn 200 or 300 yuan per month, the rest only receive a food allowance of nine to forty-five yuan. The number of workers has been reduced to 2,000, and only half of them can work in shifts each day. Their wages are only one dime, which is not enough to feed themselves, let alone support their families. The reason for the mine's downfall is the impact of the Japanese coal dumping policy. Pingxiang coal's sales were primarily for steelmaking in Hanyehping Iron and Coal Company, and for use in major ports and factories along the Yangtze River. Now, Japanese coal is sold cheaply in all these sales locations, and credit is available. Merchants are mostly shortsighted and naturally seek profits. The Commercial Revitalization Commemorative Meeting recently held by Japanese merchants in Hankou is a powerful counter-evidence of this. If Pingxiang coal is in such a state, one can imagine what other industries are like. How do the Chinese people who advocate boycotting foreign goods feel about this?</p>
<p>Pingxiang is located on the western border of Jiangxi Province. Except for the western route from the county seat to Liling along the Pingxiang-Zhuzhou Railway, which is relatively peaceful, the other three routes to the east, south, and north are all mountainous and densely forested, where bandits appear unpredictably. Cars coming from Yichun dare not drive slowly when passing through forests and mountain slopes; they even take risks to speed up, showing how alert they are. Li Tianzhu's bandit gang, with 7,000 guns, uses neighboring Lianhua and Anfuku counties as their base, and frequently harass Shangbu and Nankeng in the southern route of Pingxiang. Recently, they have even spread to the southern countryside of Liling. In the north, Kong Hechong's bandit gang, with 5,000 guns, uses the Shuiyuan area of Wanzai County as their base, and frequently try to infiltrate northern Pingxiang through Huangmao, Cihua, and Tongmu. Recently, they moved most of their bandit troops to the Yangqi Mountain area, and along Banju Mountain and other places, they reached Dapingshan on the border of Pingxiang and Liling. It appears that Li's and Kong's gangs are trying to disrupt the Jiangxi-Hunan transportation. Commissioner Wei of the Administrative District Office said that every county in western Jiangxi has bandits, and the main force is mostly in Yangqiao (belonging to Lianhua). The pseudo-Soviet government is divided into two, one located in the southeast of Jiangxi, and the other located nearby. Even if attacked by 10,000 soldiers, they dare to come out and fight. Everywhere the bandits go, slogans are painted all over the walls. For those that cannot be washed off,</p>
<p>they cleverly add or change one or two words to the existing text. For example, for the slogan "Workers and Peasants' Dictatorship," they add the words "Not Allowed" at the beginning. For the slogan "The Red Army is Fighting for the Interests of the Workers and Peasants," they change the word "Red" to "National." Looking at it, it appears quite dignified. However, for those written in remote and impoverished areas and back alleys, even adding or changing words is impossible, so they can only be eroded by wind and rain.</p>
<p>The Baojia system is quite strict. In addition to the existing organizational rules, at the beginning of the month, the commander of the 62nd Division, stationed in the area, also convened a joint meeting of all Bao heads in the city to instruct the Baojia to seriously reorganize. The agreed terms numbered as many as twenty-eight. If one household violated them, the entire Bao would be implicated. The following are eight of the more serious clauses: (1) Those who refuse to join the Baojia regulations; (2) Those who do not report to the Jia head when suspicious persons sneak in; (3) Those who do not report to the Jia head when visitors from other places stay overnight, or when family members travel overnight and return; (4) Those who do not report to the Jia head when births, deaths, or other events cause changes in the household registration; (5) Those who provide false information when registering their household or arbitrarily destroy their house number; (6) Those who refuse to be drafted into the militia; (7) Those who do not comply with assigned tasks; (8) Those who refuse to pay the Baojia expenses without reason or delay payment without reason. Households that violate any of the above clauses will be fined four to forty yuan. In addition, the land tax and other taxes throughout the county are said to be quite heavy.</p>
<p>The county has little arable land, and food is insufficient, so it is mostly imported from Lianhua or Hunan. Usually, farmers engage in the carting of coal and grain. They are not afraid of the communist bandits, and the communist bandits are said not to rob them. The customs are similar to those of Yichun. In case of disputes, one of the parties usually invites a mediator to comment, called "qi xi" (starting a seat). Then, the other party invites the original mediator or hires others to reconsider, called "fu xi" (returning to the seat). The party who is at fault bears the cost of tea, snacks, and banquets for the mediators' meeting. If the matter is settled fairly, then each party shares half of the cost. Recently, with the establishment of district and township offices, few people voluntarily request them to mediate disputes. To file a complaint with the county government is even rarer.

<h3>Guangdong Provincial Government Revises Administrative Expenses for Various Counties</h3>
<p>丨New Budget to be Implemented from September丨</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: Recently, the Guangdong Provincial Government has been facing huge expenditures, and various public and military expenses have been increasing without decreasing. Over the years, it has not been able to overcome the trade deficit. According to the latest statistics from the Finance Department, the provincial treasury's income in July was 3,154,312 yuan, and the expenditures were 3,250,811 yuan. In order to reorganize the administrative expenses of various counties in the province and maintain the treasury's currency, the financial authorities have recently revised the new budget for administrative expenses of various counties, which is scheduled to be implemented in September. Currently, the administrative expenses of various counties in Guangdong are: 3,580 yuan per month for first-class counties, 2,872 yuan per month for second-class counties, and 2,068 yuan per month for third-class counties. Among them, simplified third-class counties are only allowed to spend 1,553 yuan per month, and the saved 515 yuan must be submitted for approval and allocated for local construction and conservation projects. The total annual expenditure is 2,929,440 yuan. However, according to the old regulations before April 1931, when county administrative expenses were divided into three classes and five levels, the annual expenditure for administrative expenses of all counties in the province was only 1,386,000 yuan. Compared with the current regulations, the current annual increase is 1,543,434 yuan, which is a huge amount. Therefore, since the implementation of the current regulations in April 1931, the provincial treasury's income has been greatly affected. Counties that previously had grain tax remittances to the treasury have not only had no remittances since then, but have even requested subsidies from the treasury. In order to cope with the situation and solve the difficulties, the authorities have specially ordered the Civil Affairs and Finance Departments to revise the administrative expenses of various counties and reduce them appropriately to save the treasury. The provincial government has issued an order to implement the revised regulations.

<h3>Autumn Cocoon Market Opens on Time</h3>
<p>This year's autumn silkworms were immersed in acid earlier, so those that went on the frames earlier have been there for five or six days. The rest will go on the frames today or tomorrow. However, since the beginning of autumn, there have been thunderstorms every morning, and it has been as sultry as before. When the silkworms on the frames hear thunder, some crawl out of their cocoons and die on the frames, and some die in the cocoons, causing them to rot, resulting in huge losses. Now, a certain silk factory's test reeling of autumn cocoons shows that 650 "jin" (a Chinese unit of weight, about 0.5 kg) of cocoons are needed to make one "dan" (a Chinese unit of weight, about 50 kg) of silk, which is six to ten times more than spring cocoons. The price of mulberry leaves in the four townships is very expensive, with the highest price being five yuan per "dan". The Wuxi Cocoon Industry Association held a general meeting of members yesterday (1st) at 3:00 PM at the Xujialong Association. The meeting, chaired by Hua Shaochun, decided to set September 4th as the opening date for the market. The opening price for cocoons is set at 35 yuan.</p>

<h3>Disputes in the County Chamber of Commerce Have Not Ended</h3>
<p>The election of executive and supervisory committee members of the County Chamber of Commerce on the 22nd of last month was marred by fraudulent activities perpetrated by Wu Zhongying, the supervisory election member, during the drawing of lots. Wu marked the bamboo sticks with various symbols such as "light," "hairy," "wide," "narrow," "long," and "short." However, his technique was not clever, and he was discovered by Tang Xinfu, a representative of the silver and money industry. The whole place was in an uproar, and the social community was shocked. For a while, it caused a sensation in society, and the entire silver and money industry withdrew from the Chamber of Commerce. The bamboo sticks were sealed and stored in the county government. Since then, the new executive and supervisory committee members have been stalled. Wu Zhongying, who engaged in fraudulent activities, has been trying to mediate because he has a great relationship with the matter. The other day, County Magistrate Zhou Heng personally visited Zhenye Bank to discuss the matter with Cui Junru and Tang Xinfu, representatives of the silver and money industry, and advised them to compromise in order to resolve the matter peacefully. The representatives refused to accept, saying that unless the Chamber of Commerce is re-elected or the fraudulent person is severely investigated, they will not rejoin the Chamber of Commerce. As a result, County Magistrate Zhou returned quickly. The new executive and supervisory committee members of the Chamber of Commerce, in addition to reporting to the High Court themselves, are also continuing to elect standing committee members and chairmen, etc. The date has been set for September 2nd, and the county has been asked to send personnel to supervise.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Already Within Hurricane Zone</h3>
<p>Two Hurricanes Converge and Advance Northward</p>
<p>Customs Guns Fired, Ocean Liners Suspended</p>
<p>The Ta Mei Wan Pao (Shanghai Times) reports that two hurricanes in the East China Sea, located at 26 degrees north latitude and 125 degrees east longitude, north of the Miyako Islands, are "getting married" this morning (the 1st). They are then heading northwest-west, apparently intending to spend their honeymoon near Shanghai. If the current direction remains unchanged, they will touch the coast slightly north of Wenzhou tonight. However, hurricanes appearing outside the Chinese coast often veer to the right. If that happens, the center point may reach Shanghai, which is not impossible. Judging from the current situation, proceeding at a speed of 20 miles per hour, it will reach a certain coastal area before midnight. The strength of the wind is not yet certain. Shanghai is now within the hurricane zone. The intermittent wind and rain today are a precursor to the hurricane's arrival. Ships in the Shanghai area have received warnings for precautionary measures. The Xujiahui Observatory and the Huangpu Beach Wind Signal Station are working day and night to report the progress of the hurricane to ship captains and owners. Vessels outside the coasts of Fujian, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu are currently experiencing extremely bad weather.</p>
<h3>Observatory Report</h3>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory reported at 9:00 AM on the 1st that the severe hurricane in the southern East China Sea is rapidly moving northwest-west or northwest. At 4:30 PM on the same day, it reported cloudy skies and showers or storms along the coast. The hurricane is clearly moving northwest-west, approaching the coast between Wenzhou and Shanghai, and will likely make landfall around Ningbo. The weather in the East China Sea and along the coast is very bad. There are strong easterly to north-easterly winds in the Yellow Sea. The atmospheric pressure east of the Philippines remains low. At 2:00 PM, the center point of the hurricane was within 60 miles of the intersection of 27 degrees north latitude and 125 degrees east longitude, moving northwest with severe winds. Also, in the 24 hours before 3:00 PM today, the temperature in Shanghai reached a high of 87.8 and a low of 75.5. On the same day last year, the high was 71.6 and the low was 66.0.</p>
<h3>Jianghai Customs Warning</h3>
<p>At 4:30 PM yesterday, Jianghai Customs received a further weather report,</p>
<p>knowing that strong winds and rain are heading toward Shanghai, with even greater hurricanes along the Zhejiang coast. Therefore, a cannon was fired to signal the impending major hurricane, to warn the commercial ships and small boats on the Huangpu River to take precautions and avoid disaster. After firing the cannon, a large black warning ball was also raised on the roof of the Customs House, doubled, indicating the severity of the hurricane's impact on Shanghai. The Huangpu River has been taking on a storm-preparation atmosphere since 5:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Ningbo Ships Suspended</h3>
<p>After the Customs opened the hurricane warning cannon and hung two black balls, the shipping companies in Shanghai immediately notified all ocean liners in port that those scheduled to depart should all suspend operations as a precaution. Yesterday, the Ningbo liners "New Beijing" and "New Ning Shao," etc., had already loaded their cargo, and passengers had boarded, ready to depart for Ningbo. Upon receiving this warning, the ships received orders from their companies and dared not risk sailing. They immediately notified the passengers to disembark and refund their tickets, declaring that they would not sail due to the storm. For a time, the Taikoo and Ning Shao docks were crowded with passengers seeking refunds.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Sea Ships All Blocked</h3>
<p>Commercial ships sailing from Shanghai to the Zhejiang coast, such as those on the Wenzhou-Taizhou line, the Zhoushan line, and the Ruiping line, typically depart around 5:00 PM. Yesterday, these sampans received news of the hurricane approaching Shanghai and being even stronger along the Zhejiang coast. All ships to Zhejiang also suspended operations. Those that had already sailed</p>
<p>were telegraphed to anchor in Wusong to avoid the storm. The departure dates for ships to the north and south seas were also postponed by the shipping companies until today.</p>
<h3>Huangpu River on Alert</h3>
<p>All small steamers, cargo boats, and tugboats on the Huangpu River, from 5:00 PM yesterday, followed the warning from Jianghai Customs, stopped operations early, and sailed to the Suzhou Creek or docked at the wharves to prevent accidents. Therefore, after 5:30 PM, the Huangpu River was quiet as ships prepared for the storm, and there were very few vessels traveling to and fro.</p>

(2) The rumor that Foreign Minister Luo Wengan's trip to Xinjiang this time, in addition to comforting the people of the province, will also personally investigate the secret agreement signed between former provincial chairman Jin Shuren and Russia is untrue. The Foreign Ministry has already investigated this matter thoroughly. (3) Regarding France's occupation of nine small islands in the South Pacific, there are no new developments to report. As for Japan's desire to occupy eight small islands near the nine small islands, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not yet received a confirmed report. (4) Recent foreign telegrams claiming the fall of Yanping in northern Fujian have been proven to be untrue. However, foreign warships are rushing to protect the overseas Chinese of various countries. This is an over-cautious preparation by the authorities of various countries." Mr. Tang entered Nanjing last night.</p>
<h3>Entered Nanjing Last Night</h3>
<p>Mr. Song took the Shanghai-Nanjing Express train to Nanjing at 12:00 last night. Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Security Director Yang Hu, Public Security Director Wen Hongen, and others all went to the station to see him off. Security was extremely tight. It is reported that Mr. Song is scheduled to stay briefly and then take a plane to Jiangxi on Monday with Wang Jingwei, Sun Ke, Kong Xiangxi, and other dignitaries to visit Chiang and hold an important meeting on Mount Lu.</p>

<h3>Direct Trade of Chinese Silk</h3>
<p>Miao Zhongxiu in Contact in New York</p>
<p>To Avoid Being Picked on by Foreign Merchants Again</p>
<p>Miao Zhongxiu, director of the Raw Silk Division of the Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, who was previously sent to the United States to inspect the silk industry, wrote from New York yesterday, stating that he had handled all three major tasks assigned to him on this trip to the United States. The first was to publicize the recent advantages of Chinese silk. Since arriving in the United States, he had visited hosiery and silk merchants in Chicago, New York, and various eastern provinces to publicize widely and to have the quality of the new silk samples recently sent from the Bureau checked by hosiery merchants and silk merchants. All said they were satisfied and said that Chinese silk could indeed compete with Japanese silk, that they would pay attention to using it in the future, and that they hoped that China would supply it in large quantities. This shows that the reputation of Chinese silk is gradually increasing in the United States. He hoped that Chinese silk merchants would improve and strive for progress. The second was to investigate the latest methods of inspecting raw silk in the United States. After arriving in New York, he visited the raw silk inspection center and saw that the raw silk inspection methods and machinery had been improved. He then practiced at the center for three weeks. For example, he was personally taught the inspection procedure for the nine-meter inspection of uniformity by weight calculation by the inventor. He would also adopt this method in his raw silk department after returning to China. The third, which he considered the most important and most difficult, was the issue of direct trade in Chinese silk. Because of changes in market prices, Chinese silk merchants were often picked on by foreign merchants when they paid for futures and suffered considerable losses. Direct trade was the only way to eliminate the drawbacks. After he came to the United States, he told American silk merchants about this matter. At the end of July, he hosted the leaders of American silk merchants at the New York International Office, with more than twenty people attending. At that time, he exchanged views with them on the proposal to form a direct trading company for Chinese silk (yellow, white, gray, warp) in Shanghai, New York, and Lyon. The attendees at the time said that if there was a proper way to gain the trust of the American market, they would very much approve. In recent days, he had been running around the New York silk merchants about this matter, and as soon as the contact was in order, he would pack up and return home and discuss the organization method with domestic silk industry groups and government agencies.</p>
<h3>Workers at Various Silk Factories in Zhabei Went on Strike Again Yesterday</h3>
<p>Opposing the Factory's Revision of the Wage System</p>
<p>Party and Government Agencies Send Personnel to Investigate the Truth</p>
<p>Da Gong She (L'Impartial) reported that workers at various silk factories in Shanghai went on strike in July of this year because their demands for wage restoration were not met. On July 8, it was resolved through mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau that wages would be increased by 5% (equivalent to 5 jiao). Recently, due to the decline in silk prices, the factories planned to revise the wages of female workers by implementing a production-based system, which was scheduled to be implemented on September 1. The Sixth Sericulture Workers' Union sent a letter to the Silk Industry Association requesting that the relevant measures be decided after being submitted to the Party and government for study. Unexpectedly, the Bao Tai and other factories on Chang'an Road announced that they would implement the production-based system across the board from September 1, which aroused resentment from the workers.</p>
<h3>Joint Strike</h3>
<p>More than 300 workers from the Bao Tai, Wu Xing, and other silk factories on Chang'an Road in Zhabei went on strike at 1:00 PM yesterday because they opposed the factory's adoption of a production-based system for wage distribution. At the same time, more than 2,000 workers from fourteen nearby factories, including Chu Xin, Fu Xing, Mao Feng, Fu Yuan, Yuan Xing and Yuan Ji on Yu Tong Road, Ji Yu on Gonghe Road, and Hong Tai on Guangfu Road, joined the strike after hearing about the Bao Tai strike, and the situation was quite serious.</p>
<h3>Factories Not Stopped</h3>
<p>As for the remaining silk factories, such as Feng Tai at Da Yang Bridge, Yu Tai at Tanzi Bay, Gong Da at Zhongxing Road, Fu Chang at Pengpu Bridge, Tian Sheng, Hong Yu, Ying Ji at Liuying Road, Yu Feng and Xing Lun at Gujiawan, Ding Feng, Mao Li, Xie Xin, Xie He, Hong Sheng, Yuan Xin, etc. at Yanjiage, the workers were satisfied with the method of reducing wages because they did not approve of changing the output system to pay wages. Therefore, they did not participate in the strike yesterday and continued to work as usual.</p>
<h3>Union Persuasion</h3>
<p>Since the workers of fourteen silk factories including Bao Tai went on joint strike, the Sixth District Sericulture Workers' Union was deeply afraid that the dispute would escalate. It immediately sent personnel to various factories to earnestly persuade the workers and instructed them to resume work as usual this morning. The issue of the wage system would be handled by the union to negotiate with various factories. However, whether it could resume normal work this morning could not be predicted.</p>
<h3>Party and Government Investigate</h3>
<p>After learning of the strike in the silk reeling factories in Zhabei, the Party and government agencies sent Fan Guoren, the cadre of the People's Movement Section of the Municipal Party Department, Zhao Rongchu, the cadre of the Third Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, and Fu Zhenbei, the director of the Second Precinct of the Fourth District, to the silk factories in Zhabei and the Sixth District Sericulture Workers' Union to investigate the truth in order to conduct mediation.</p>
<h3>Labor Representatives Expressed</h3>
<p>Da Gong She reporters met yesterday with people in charge of the Sixth District Sericulture Workers' Union, who said that the employers should be fully responsible for this labor unrest. On the 29th of last month, after the association received a notice from the Silk Factory Trade Association to change the wage system and implement the output system from September 1, it convened a meeting of all directors and supervisors to discuss the matter. It was resolved that the matter was of great importance. For the sake of improving the output of raw silk, the principle was very much in agreement. However, the detailed content of the system was not known to the union in advance. An inquiry was made to the trade association for more information, and in view of the urgency of the matter, it was requested to postpone implementation to avoid disputes. A letter was sent to the association for verification. On the one hand, opinions were prepared and submitted to the Party and government agencies on the 31st of last month, requesting supervision and leadership, and organizing a research committee. Labor and management, under the supervision of Party and government agencies, would jointly study a proper and average standard. After soliciting the consent of the worker representatives of various factories, labor and management would both benefit, and then the implementation issue could be discussed. The employer now suddenly implemented the destruction of the entire July 8 settlement decision, which caused the labor unrest, so the employer was really hard to blame. Now the association is doing its best to persuade the workers to resume work tomorrow and wait for the association to resolve the matter. Do not riot to cause a scandal.</p>
<h3>Factory Should Report to Municipal Government If Industrial Bureau Interferes</h3>
<p>City Chamber of Commerce Sends Letter to All Industries</p>
<p>Xin Sheng She (New Life News Agency) reported that the City Chamber of Commerce notified the Four National Goods Associations and various trade associations yesterday, saying: "Recently, the authorities of the Shanghai International Settlement have been interfering with various factories in the Settlement every month under the pretext of cracking down on dangerous businesses. The situation has been reported and transferred to the Municipal Government for serious negotiation. Now, the Shanghai Municipal Government Secretariat's letter No. 1250 states: 'The Government has repeatedly dispatched personnel to negotiate on the inspection of factories in the Settlement. It has been reported that the Industrial Bureau of the Settlement often interferes with factories in the Settlement under the pretext of cracking down on dangerous businesses. In the future, if the same event occurs, the factory should immediately report to the Government after receiving the notice from the Industrial Bureau so that personnel can be dispatched to investigate and verify the handling. It is hoped that your association will quickly transfer the order to the various factories and abide by it.' The association is hereby notified to comply."</p>
<h3>Anti-War Conference Representative Returned to Shanghai from Nanjing</h3>
<p>The Results of Contacting the Association Were Still Good</p>
<p>It Was Decided to Make the Conference a Success</p>
<p>Shanghai Times reported that Hamilton, the British representative of the Anti-War Conference, had left Shanghai for Nanjing last Saturday. It is now back, claiming that the trip was made in a private capacity, carrying an introduction letter from the Chinese Embassy in London to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but did not discuss the conference issue there. However, when meeting with a certain member, he touched on the association affairs, and the misunderstanding was dispelled. The authorities in Nanjing can be said to have taken a neutral attitude towards the conference. Lord Marley did not speak yesterday (31st), but said that he was very pleased with the results of Hamilton's trip to Nanjing. He also said that the representatives decided to make the conference a success, and if the location was not in Shanghai, it would be near Shanghai.</p>
<p>Da Mei Wan Bao (Shanghai Evening Post) reported that Lord Marley, chairman of the Anti-War Conference, said this morning that he had decided to take a trip to the old Chinese capital of Nanjing. If the</p>
<p>date of the conference has been set and there is spare time, he intends to start his trip within the next week; otherwise, he will depart after the closing ceremony. The length of the trip will depend on how early he departs, as there are still matters in London that need to be dealt with urgently. The trip to Nanjing may be cancelled, as he hopes to meet several government officials in Shanghai. Next Tuesday, the Lord will give a broadcast speech, which will be translated into Chinese. The topic needs to be announced temporarily. At noon yesterday (31st), the Lord spoke at a luncheon of the Rotary Club of the city, entitled "Anti-War Conference," stating that every time a war breaks out, the authorities always claim it to be a war of self-defense. It is important to know that at the beginning of the European War, both Germany and Britain said the same thing. At yesterday's Rotary Club meeting, the attendees included former US Ambassador to China Schurman, US Consul General to Shanghai Cunningham, German Ambassador to China Todtmann, and other people from various countries.</p>

<h3>The Labor Strike at British-American Tobacco Factory Turns Into a Labor-Management Dispute</h3>
<p>The Stamp Department Resumes Work Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>The Crowd Angrily Surrounds and Prevents It</p>
<p>According to Da Gong She, since the internal dispute within the British-American Tobacco Company's New and Old Factories in Pudong, the situation has become increasingly severe. Hundreds of workers in the New Factory's Stamp Department petitioned the city government the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning at 7:00 AM, they returned to the factory as usual, started the motors, and prepared to resume work. Upon hearing the news, workers in other departments became angry and immediately gathered more than 2,000 workers to surround the factory gate. The Public Security Bureau was informed and immediately dispatched a large number of police officers to the scene to suppress the situation. Fortunately, no incidents occurred. The Ministry of Finance's Taxation Department sent personnel yesterday to thoroughly investigate and mediate. The details are recorded separately below.</p>
<h3>Resumption of Work</h3>
<p>The Second Factory of British-American Tobacco Company in Lujiazui has more than 5,000 male and female workers. Since participating in the general strike, internal opinions have suddenly diverged. More than 600 workers in the Stamp Department questioned the union and advocated resuming work. The day before yesterday, they sent more than 100 representatives to petition the city government, requesting that the Public Security Bureau be instructed to send police to protect the workers. Yesterday morning at 7:00 AM, these workers entered the factory and immediately started the motors to prepare for work, which aroused the anger of workers in other departments.</p>
<h3>Surrounding the New Factory</h3>
<p>After the workers in the Stamp Department and other departments of the New Factory entered the factory and started the motors, workers in other departments believed that they were intentionally disrupting the strike order. They immediately joined forces with more than 2,000 workers from the Old Factory and went to surround the New Factory from all sides. More than 300 workers rushed into the factory building, intending to forcibly stop the work. The situation suddenly became serious.</p>
<h3>Dispatching Police to Suppress</h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau, according to the report from Cai Yuantang, captain of the Second Brigade of the stationed petitioning police, instructed more than 30 long-term police officers to cooperate with all the police officers of the Second Detachment of the Security Team, as well as hundreds of petitioning police officers in the factory. Fully armed, they were deployed around the perimeter. Inspector Li and others, together with all the directors and supervisors of the Fifth District Cigarette Workers' Union, contacted Li Dehe, a Western staff member of the factory, to temporarily suspend work until the labor unrest was resolved, so as to prevent the dispute from escalating. As a result, the factory expressed its acceptance and immediately shut down all the motors. At the same time, the police officers persuaded the workers surrounding the outside of the factory separately. They dispersed at about 11:00 AM.</p>
<h3>Party Headquarters Summoning</h3>
<p>Since the Municipal Party Headquarters received a petition from the Fifth District Cigarette Workers' Union requesting a thorough investigation, it was deeply concerned that the labor unrest would become more severe and difficult to manage. In order to clarify the internal opinions of the workers, the Civil Affairs Section summoned Pan Quanrong, Zhang Xiqi, Chen Shengkui, Xu Wenqing, and Chen Siming, workers in the Stamp Department of the New Factory, to the department for questioning and gave them strict advice, ordering them to wait quietly for the Party and government to mediate according to law before the labor unrest was resolved, so as to avoid causing unexpected disputes.</p>
<h3>Song Will Mediate</h3>
<p>The Fifth District Cigarette Workers' Union believed that the labor unrest had been mediated by the Party and government several times, but no solution had been reached. Therefore, it sent a letter to Finance Minister Song requesting him to act as a mediator. After receiving the report, Song believed that the labor unrest had been delayed without resolution and would affect the national tax revenue. Yesterday, he specially sent Zhang, a staff member of the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance, to Pudong to investigate the truth from the factory and the Fifth District Cigarette Workers' Union, so as to conduct mediation at an opportune time.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Decides</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government, considering that the labor and management of the British-American Tobacco Company have been deadlocked for a long time and have not yet been resolved, has specially formulated a solution and ordered the Social Affairs Bureau to order both labor and management to abide by it. The content is as follows: 1. The dismissal of worker Fang Fuqi is approved. 2. Worker No. 146 should be reinstated. 3. Wages should be paid as usual during the strike period of all workers in the Old Factory, and 70% of the wages should be paid for the affected parts. Wages should be paid at half price during the strike period of all workers in the New Factory. After receiving the order, the Social Affairs Bureau instructed both parties to comply yesterday.</p>
<h3>Request to Stop</h3>
<p>The Fifth District Cigarette Workers' Union reported to the Party and government agencies: This is an urgent report. We have learned that Pan Quanrong and other workers in the New Stamp Department have been used by the factory to incite workers to resume work, arousing public outrage among workers in the New and Old Factories. We have already reported this. Unexpectedly, this morning at 7:00 AM, Pan Quanrong and others entered the factory and still started the motors first. The whole factory was in turmoil. There were thousands of people gathered in front of the department, unanimously demanding that the department immediately stop working. The Westerners in the department, fearing that conflicts would occur and damage the machines, ordered the motors to stop. After hearing the news, our union immediately entered the factory with all the directors and supervisors to maintain order and prevent accidents. It has been found that there are hundreds of workers in the department, and only a few of them are willing to work. They are being forced to resume work by Pan Quanrong, who is using the power of the factory, and it is not voluntary. The total number of workers in the factory is more than 8,000. How can a small number of bad elements be allowed to undermine unity? Although the department has stopped working, Pan and others are still thinking about starting the motors. If they continue to incite public outrage and damage the factory's machines, our union will be unable to bear the responsibility. Therefore, we urgently report and request an immediate stop. Respectfully submitted to the Municipal Party Headquarters.</p>
<h3>General Union Investigation</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Labor Union believes that the general strike of the workers of the British-American Tobacco Factory is a struggle against international capitalism and is of great significance to the entire labor movement. Now that it has learned that internal opinions have arisen in the factory, causing labor-management disputes, it believes that this is unfavorable to the future. Therefore, it has specially sent personnel to investigate the truth, so as to persuade both parties not to be used by private individuals and to unite and struggle to achieve the final victory.</p>
<h3>Fourth District Declaration</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Fourth District Cigarette Industry Union issued a declaration of assistance for the British-American labor unrest: International capitalists rely on their unequal treaties as a talisman to open up markets in China and implement their economic aggression. They use their terrifying means to oppress our hard-working and weak workers. This time, the workers of the British-American Tobacco Factory, unable to withstand the factory's repeated destruction, resolutely responded with a general strike. In addition to upholding the friendship of the same class, our union vows to be a strong supporter. We hope that all workers will align their steps and make a strong struggle. This is our declaration.</p>
<h3>Zhang Danru and Others Petition to Organize a Gold and Silver Exchange</h3>
<p>According to Xin Xin She, the merger of the city's Gold Exchange and the Gold Department of the Securities and Commodities Exchange has not been resolved due to differing opinions between the two parties. Now, gold merchants Zhang Danru, Yu Huancheng, Sheng Chunlin, etc., have initiated the establishment of the Shanghai Gold and Silver Exchange. They have submitted a document to the Social Affairs Bureau to be forwarded to the Municipal Government for consultation with the Ministry of Industry. The Social Affairs Bureau's document to the Municipal Government is copied below: According to the petition submitted by merchants Zhang Danru and others, We, Danru and others, have been engaged in commerce in Shanghai and have been trading in margin gold on the Shanghai Securities and Commodities Exchange and the Gold Exchange. Looking at the world situation, although there are many countries that use gold, silver is indispensable. Our country is a silver-using country, and Shanghai is a gathering place for foreign trade. The price difference between gold and silver is considerable. It relies entirely on the fair market price set by the exchange to stabilize it. Recently, we have heard that the business term of the Shanghai Securities and Commodities Exchange and the Gold Exchange has expired and they cannot be merged according to law. Although they are still actively negotiating, the two parties have differing opinions. In the extreme case, it is difficult to get close. We are afraid that the government, in order to maintain the authority of the law, may not listen to their protracted delay and order them to disband. If the transaction is suspended, all foreign trade merchants will be greatly affected. Therefore, we have gathered twenty like-minded colleagues to initiate the organization of a Shanghai Gold and Silver Exchange Co., Ltd. The total capital is 1 million yuan, divided into 50,000 shares, each share worth 20 yuan. All the shares have been fully subscribed by the founders. Once the government approves, we can collect the share capital and establish it on a fixed date in accordance with legal procedures. The exchange will not have to worry about suspension, and foreign trade merchants will be spared the pain of gold price hikes. It is reasonable to check the provisions of Article 1 of the Implementing Rules of the Exchange Law, and separately submit a petition stating the facts and submit it to your bureau for review and approval. Enclosed are three copies of the original petition. Accordingly, in addition to submitting it to the Ministry of Industry for review and approval in accordance with the law and issuing instructions, we have enclosed the original petition and respectfully submit it to your Excellency for review and approval, and forward it to the Ministry of Industry for review and approval. Respectfully submitted.</p>

<h3>Kidnapping Attempt Fails, Gunmen Fire Two Shots at Victim</h3>
<p>Textile Magnate Xu Luqing Encountered Danger Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Shot and Wounded, Life Not in Imminent Danger</p>
<p>Vehicle Number 16669 Suspect</p>
<p>At around 9:30 yesterday morning, a case of failed kidnapping and shooting of the victim occurred on Haig Road, Jing'an Temple. The details are described below.</p>
<h3>Gang's Covetousness</h3>
<p>Xu Luqing, a Ningbo native, is 47 years old and lives at No. 167 Yuyuan Road. He has two sons, the eldest son, Ruifu, is 26 years old, and the youngest son, Kuifu, is 21 years old. Both work in the Kenye and Heli Banks. Xu himself is a broker at No. 42 on the Cotton Exchange and runs the Yiyuan Cotton Yarn Company. Because Xu is by nature stingy and thrifty in managing his family, he has accumulated some wealth over the years. This has aroused the covetousness of the gang. However, Xu has long been wary, so he changes his attire frequently when he goes out every day, or even avoids certain roads.</p>
<h3>Sudden Kidnapping</h3>
<p>Unexpectedly, at around 9:30 yesterday morning, Xu left his home on foot. When he arrived at the public bus stop in front of the Happy Barber Shop at No. 27 Haig Road, Jing'an Temple Road, three kidnappers suddenly appeared by the roadside. One was wearing a Western suit and shirt, one was wearing a white silk long gown, and one was wearing short clothes. The kidnapper in the white long gown stepped forward and grabbed Xu's left hand, dragging him violently. At that time, Xu was panicked and struggled desperately to escape, intending to flee into the Happy Barber Shop. Seeing this, the kidnapper in the Western suit stepped forward and grabbed Xu. Seeing that the situation was critical, Xu fell to the ground.</p>
<h3>Two Shots Fired</h3>
<p>When he shouted "Kidnapping!", two Russian public bus ticket inspectors, No. 44 and No. 62, happened to be waiting for a bus at the public bus stop at that location. Hearing the urgent shouts, they ran to the scene to check and tried to rescue Xu. Unexpectedly, they were threatened back by the kidnapper in the Western suit with a gun. At the same time, the kidnapper in the white long gown drew his gun and fired two shots at Xu. The kidnapper in the Western suit also tried to turn around and fire, but the bullets jammed and he did not fire. The kidnappers panicked and immediately jumped into a black-licensed vehicle with the Concession registration number 16669, which was parked by the roadside in advance, and sped away south on Haig Road.</p>
<h3>Life Can Be Saved</h3>
<p>At that time, Indian Constable No. 671 at the traffic post at the intersection of Haig Road had received a police report and saw the vehicle speeding away. Unable to catch up, he quickly drew his gun and fired five shots at the kidnappers' vehicle. It is not yet known whether he hit the vehicle. He immediately returned to send Xu to the Haig Road Red Cross Hospital for treatment and reported to the police station, which dispatched detectives to pursue the kidnappers in all directions. After Xu Luqing was sent to the hospital, the hospital examined him and found that he had been shot twice, once in the leg and once in the lower abdomen. Fortunately, the intestines and bladder were not damaged, so his life was not in great danger. The bullets remained in the abdomen and will be removed by surgery. As of 12:00 last night, the kidnappers' vehicle had not been found. At the same time, it is still questionable whether the vehicle's registration number is 16669. All police stations have notified all police agencies in the city to assist in the pursuit.</p>
<h3>Robbers Open Fire By Mistake, Killing Accomplice</h3>
<p>One Robber Arrested, Confesses Details</p>
<p>On July 5 of this year, at 10:30 AM, Chen Longhe, the accountant of Yisheng Rubber Factory at No. 83 Binlang Road, and Cai Alai, the owner of Dafeng Tobacco Paper Store at No. 904 Xiaoshadu Road, were returning after withdrawing money from the Salt Industry Bank on Robert Sheng Road. When they passed near Binlang Road, Xiaoshadu Road, they were suddenly encountered by four robbers. One of them held a handgun and blocked their way, hoping to rob them. Chen and others shouted for help and desperately fled. Seeing that the situation was not good, the robber with the gun immediately fired a shot. Unexpectedly, the bullet hit his accomplice, Yin Laowu, in a vital spot. He was injured and fell inside Da Xu Li Lane. Chen and others were able to take the opportunity to escape without loss. When the patrolmen arrived after hearing the alarm, the gang had already fled without a trace. The injured robber Yin Laowu was taken to the hospital, but he died en route due to his serious injuries. He was then sent to the coroner's office for examination. At around 7:00 AM the day before yesterday, Chinese Detective Hua Men and Chinese Detective Wang Yongjun of the Jing'an Temple Police Station arrested one of the robbers, Hong Shengzhang (aka Wang Dadaizi), an Anhui native, on Ningbo Road and took him to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Wang Yaotang, the police lawyer, presented the case and requested that the defendant be detained for investigation. When questioned, the defendant Hong Shengzhang confessed that he, the fugitive Hua Deming, Liu Haiqing, and the deceased had discussed the matter in advance at Hua's home. Hua held the gun, and I was on lookout behind. At the time, the victim shouted, so Hua fired the gun, but mistakenly killed his accomplice Yin Laowu. Judge Xue Lanru verified the confession and ordered Hong to be detained for seven days for investigation.</p>
<h3>Aftermath of a Brothel Rivalry</h3>
<p>Yang Keming's Love Affair Creates Trouble</p>
<p>Lu Qingyang Involved, Suspended from Duty</p>
<p>Feng Xiuzhen, also known as Yifei Laoqi, a prostitute at the Fuyu Li No. 6 brothel on Yunnan Road, although past her prime, still retains her charm and has the ability to captivate the public. Last year, she entered into a blood oath alliance with Yang Keming, a handsome young man from Ningbo. This year, she formed an inextricable bond with Shi Jinnan, a wealthy merchant from Yue. Unexpectedly, the old and new lovers gathered unexpectedly the other night, and the jealous rivalry created waves. Yang held a pre-agreement ticket stating that the prostitute agreed to marry him, accused Shi of adultery with his fiancée, and filed a complaint with the police station. After investigation, the police found that the note was written unilaterally by Yang and was nothing more than a blackmail attempt against Shi. Yang and Han Shuiqiao, who helped him defraud, were taken into custody by the First Special District Court the next morning. The details were detailed in yesterday's newspaper. We have learned that Laoqi strongly denied that she had agreed to the note submitted by Yang. However, their love had reached a considerable level at normal times, and during their intimate moments, Laoqi had expressed her intention to devote herself to Yang. However, she requested that Yang pay off her 1,500 yuan debt, but Yang was unable to raise the large sum of money, so she remained a public woman. That evening, when he saw Shi Jinnan pluck the flower, and there were many guests present, he felt even more embarrassed and hurriedly left. He gathered four or five friends and went to catch the adulterer the next morning, resulting in legal trouble. Afterwards, the police station considered that there was more than just Han Shuiqiao accompanying Yang, so they waited for the court to question and interrogated Yang about his accomplices. He confessed that Lu Qingyang, a fellow villager living at No. 621 Tiantong Road, had also participated in the day's events. Lu is currently working as a clerk in a certain agency. The police head then dispatched Feng Xiushan, the detective in charge of the case, to arrest Lu. The day before, at the end of August, Lu received his monthly salary. His superiors dismissed him from his position because he had committed a criminal offense. Yesterday morning, Detective Feng escorted Lu to the First Special Court, where Judge Feng Shide presided over the interrogation. Police Lawyer Ru Baoyi stated the case and requested that Lu be held in custody to wait for the interrogation with Yang Keming, Han Shuiqiao, etc. on September 7. Lu also hired Lawyer Ye Shaoying to defend him in court. The court approved the police's request and ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody and rescheduled for interrogation on September 7.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Communications Prepares Sino-British Communications</h3>
<p>Trainees Returning to Shanghai from England</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications' International Telecommunications Bureau is preparing for Sino-British communications. Since a large number of machines have been shipped to Shanghai one after another, the bureau has transported them to the newly built radio station in Zhenru for assembly. It is reported that 70% of the machines have been shipped to Shanghai for assembly. The remaining machines will arrive in Shanghai completely in mid-month. As for the trainees sent by the Ministry of Communications to England to practice communications, they will arrive in Shanghai at the end of this month. After the trainees arrive in Shanghai, they will be sent to the radio station to test Sino-British communications. The communication date was originally set for October 1, but it has been decided to postpone it for one month due to concerns that the assembly of machines and other matters may not be completed as scheduled.</p>
<h3>Jointly Forming a Social Science Research Association</h3>
<p>The study of social sciences has gradually attracted the attention of public and private institutions in China this year, and there has been considerable development. However, the division of labor and cooperation is not fully implemented due to the lack of liaison mechanisms. In view of this, the Chinese Economic Society and the Chinese Statistical Society have initiated the establishment of the Chinese Social Science Research Committee to promote the research of social sciences throughout the country and its division of labor and cooperation. In addition to the above two societies, the participating groups include the Academia Sinica, the Peiping Social Survey Institute, the Nankai University School of Economics, the Investigation Section of the National Tariff Commission, the Chinese Economic and Statistical Research Institute, the Jiaotong University Research Institute, the China Branch of the Pacific International Institute, the Research Department of the Sun Yat-sen Culture and Education Museum, the Lingnan University School of Economics and Politics, and the Logistics School's Economics and Politics Special Class, etc., more than ten institutions. The committee members are Ma Yinchu, Liu Dajun, Zhang Jia'ao, Jia Shiyi, Wu Chaochang, He Dekui, Dai Kexie, Li Zhaohuan, Li Quanshi, Wang Zhongwu, Wu Dajian, Zhu Junyi, Zhang Xinyi, Sheng Jun, Lin Wei, Sun Zheng, Tao Menghe, He Lian, Cai Zimin, Zhong Rongguang, Yang Duanliu, Hu Shi, Xu Xinliu, Zhou Zuomin, and other twenty-four people. Liu Dajun was elected as Chairman, He Lian as Vice Chairman, Sheng Jun as Secretary, and Xu Xinliu as Accountant. Zhou Yabo was also hired as an executive. Letters were sent to various research institutions to investigate their completed, ongoing, and planned work, and to solicit suggestions from various institutions on the division of labor and cooperation. As for rural economic research, because many institutions are conducting research, the standing committee members have directly investigated the progress of the research and reported the results to all committee members.</p>
<h3>Coal Transport in Kailuan Mining Area Has Resumed</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Kailuan Sales Office sent a letter to this newspaper: We have recently seen reports that there are still many bandits in the Qinhuangdao to Kaiping area along the Beining Road, which is very unsettling. Our office is particularly concerned because the area is the hub of production and transportation. We recently received a letter from our headquarters informing us that the Qinhuangdao and Tangshan areas are now as peaceful as usual, and that an average of 19,000 tons of coal are transported from the mining area to Qinhuangdao every day. This proves that the above-mentioned unsettling situation is not true. We are sending this letter to inform you and hope that your newspaper will consider it and reprint it in the news column. We would be very grateful.</p>
<h3>Ice Fresh Industry Association Ordered to Reorganize</h3>
<p>The collection of fishery construction fees in the Jiangsu-Zhejiang area has not been implemented due to the opposition of some fishermen and merchants. The Ministry of Industry believed that this construction fee should be used exclusively to protect fishermen, so it repeatedly sent personnel to explain to the fishermen and merchants. Except for the ice fresh industry fish merchants who still insisted on opposing it, the rest of the fish merchants have expressed their willingness to comply with the ministry's order to pay. It is reported that the authorities ordered the association to stop its activities and reorganize immediately on the 30th of last month because the Ice Fresh Industry Association has repeatedly disobeyed orders.</p>
<h3>Chinese Youth Explorer Returns Successfully After Overcoming Difficulties</h3>
<p>Only One Person Left in the Sixteen-Member Team, All Separated Midway</p>
<p>Spent More Than a Year Traveling Through Dozens of Provinces, Experiencing All Kinds of Difficulties</p>
<p>Chen Yiqin, a Chinese youth world explorer, embarked on a long-distance exploration from Guangzhou in June last year. He passed through Shanghai and went north in April of this year. After more than a year, and having endured all kinds of hardships, he has completed his work and set off south in [the previous] month, arriving in Shanghai yesterday (September 1). After resting for a day or two, he will take a boat to Guangdong to return home. According to Chen Yiqin's account to reporters, the details of his trip are as follows:</p>
<h3>Motivation for Departure</h3>
<p>According to Chen, I have seen that the Chinese people do not pay attention to the customs and practices of various parts of the country, and have no adequate understanding of the world situation. In this state, we cannot consolidate our own position, nor can we compete with other countries in technology. The result will inevitably be failure. In order to strengthen the race, save the country, and improve the international position, I initiated the organization of the Youth World Exploration Team with my siblings and relatives. The initial members of the team included Lin Xiehe and others, a total of sixteen people. The purpose of our team's exploration is: 1. To seek out hidden and secret places to uncover the riddles of hundreds of years ago; 2. To investigate local customs and practices and compile them into magazines for the world; 3. To take unique activity films on the ground and contribute the results to the people of the world.</p>
<h3>Exploratory Experiences</h3>
<p>When our team set off for Fuzhou, my younger brother, Yike, fell into the river while crossing a bridge and was seriously injured. Therefore, I returned to Guangdong to treat my brother, but the medicine proved ineffective, and he eventually passed away. My colleagues and I revived our ambitious endeavor in December, traveling from Guangdong to Shanghai, then to Beijing and Hebei, covering more than ten provinces. This journey lasted for over a year. Due to various setbacks, some comrades feared to proceed and separated midway, leaving only one person remaining to this day. The perilous experiences encountered can be summarized in five points: ㈠ the death of my brother, Yike; ㈡ encountering bandits in Huizhou, where one comrade was killed, and although all our belongings were looted, I managed to escape; ㈢ encountering a severe storm at sea, which caused our ship to sink. I floated on a lifebuoy for three days and nights, without food or drink, until I was rescued in Shantou; ㈣ being attacked in Shanghai, where a villain demanded my national passport but failed, almost succeeding in harming me; ㈤ participating in the front lines of the war against Japan until the Sino-Japanese peace agreement was signed, after which I left the military. The above are all the perilous experiences I encountered but managed to survive.</p>
<h3>Future Plans</h3>
<p>During this trip, I obtained many major local products and antiques. Whenever I arrived at a location, I would record the circumstances in writing and send them to Guangdong in installments, intending to compile them into a book for the reference of our countrymen. The team's work plan is divided into five phases, the details of which have been published in newspapers in the provinces we have traveled through. Since the anti-Japanese war in the Northeast, the second phase of our work has come to an end. I plan to return to the province to compile a report and then undertake the third phase of our exploration work. The itinerary for the third phase is planned to depart from Hong Kong, passing through Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, the South Seas Islands, India, Nepal, Bhutan, Tibet, Xikang, Sichuan, Guizhou, Hunan, and ending in Jiangxi, with an estimated duration of two years. After completing the tour of China, I will then travel to Europe to explore various countries around the world.</p>

<h3>Chinese Medical Association's Public Health Class Concludes Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Public Health Class organized by the Chinese Medical Association began its classes on July 15th. Professors of various subjects, such as Zhang Wei, taught the importance and scope of public health; Wu Liande taught the history of medicine and public health development; Jiang Shicheng taught environmental hygiene; Lai Douyan taught the management of infectious diseases; Tao Chi-sun and Zhu Xiru taught vital statistics; Zhang Wei and Zhang Zhisheng taught nurse and child protection; Zhang Zhisheng, Zhang Wei, and Sun Jiaqi taught school hygiene; Li Xuanguo taught industrial hygiene; Wu Liguo taught health education; Lin Guohao taught nutrition; Wu Xingye taught health insurance; Yan Fuqing taught medical socialization; Li Tingan and Zhao Chan taught public health administration; and Xu Ai taught public health visitation. The course concluded yesterday, and the students of the class held a banquet for the professors. The chairman, Li Shuhua, the current chief of the Health Section of the Jiangxi Civil Affairs Department, said in essence that the association held a public health class during the hot summer months, and its enthusiasm for promotion was admirable. The students should use what they have learned to work hard on sanitation in various places. Then, President Niu, Secretary-General Zhu, and Director of the Health Bureau Li gave speeches. The event ended in joy.</p>
<h3>Compatriots Invent Water-Powered Motor</h3>
<p>After the successful invention of the water-powered motor (i.e., self-powered engine) by Zhejiang residents Shan Chunqiao and Chen Xinbiao, news of the event has been repeatedly reported in the newspapers. It is now known that prominent figures in Shanghai's industrial circles, after reading the reports, have flocked to see it. The road to the workshop is filled with visitors. However, the inventors, as the motor is currently being submitted to the central government for patent protection, are unable to display it for public viewing at this time. They deeply apologize to those who have traveled to visit but have been politely declined. The research process involved ten years of painstaking effort, with over a hundred failures, ultimately leading to bankruptcy before achieving success. Their spirit of perseverance and resilience is truly commendable and marks a new record in China's scientific community. Therefore, they are temporarily keeping their life's work a secret until it is ready for public demonstration. It is reported that many people in the industrial sector are contacting the inventors. To facilitate communication, a preparatory office has been set up at No. 22, Jiujiang Road, 3rd Floor, in the Shanghai International Settlement, and a temporary factory has also been established to produce prototypes for testing. It is scheduled to invite the press to visit sometime in the middle of the month.</p>
<h3>Municipal Health Bureau Opens Municipal South Clinic</h3>
<p>The Municipal Health Bureau, recognizing the dense population and numerous diseases in the Nanshi area, has established that although there are a few public and private medical facilities, most of them charge high fees, making them inaccessible to those who are not wealthy. Furthermore, since the January 28th Incident, all industries in the city have been in decline, the economy has deteriorated, and unemployment has increased. Therefore, the need for free medical care is more pressing than ever. A request was submitted to the Municipal Government for an appropriation of 4,800 yuan for establishment costs and 1,000 yuan per month for recurring expenses. Seven municipal houses in Yude Lane, Penglai Road, in the central area of Nanshi, were rented and converted into a clinic. Currently, workers have been hired to renovate the buildings and install all necessary equipment inside. The clinic is expected to be completed and open for consultations in the middle of this month. The clinic will have departments of internal medicine, surgery, otolaryngology, obstetrics, venereology, pediatrics, and physical therapy, all staffed by experienced physicians.</p>
<h3>Ren Xiangzhe, Chief Prosecutor of Shanghai District Court</h3>
<p>Ren Xiangzhe, the former head of the Wu County Court has now been appointed as the Chief Prosecutor of the Shanghai First Special District Court by order of the Ministry of Judicial Administration and will take office in Shanghai shortly.</p>

<h3>Wenzhou Shipping Competition</h3>
<p>Haiyan Ship Suspends Service</p>
<p>Xinfeng Ship to be Transferred</p>
<p>Since the China Merchants Bureau discussed opening the Ruiping ferry service in Wenzhou, it has sparked competition among various smaller shipping companies, leading to a maritime battle. Both sides have been exerting all their efforts to attack each other, resulting in the unfortunate suspension of the Haiyan ship, with all its crew members laid off, adding to the number of unemployed. The struggle is still ongoing.</p>
<p>Small Ships Unite The China Merchants Bureau has always had a dominant and profitable position in Wenzhou shipping. Recently, various small ships from Nanshi added Wenzhou services, also operating at smaller inland piers. As a result, a large number of passengers and cargo have been taken away by these smaller ships. Therefore, the old plan was revived this year to implement the Ruian-Pingyang route proposed by Guo Wai-feng to make up for the lack of cargo transportation. Bureau members, such as Wang Heqing, were specially dispatched to Ruiping for inspection, preparing for the opening of the service. This caused unease among the various Wenzhou ferry services in Nanshi. Since Ruiping is a small inland pier, if the China Merchants Bureau were to operate ships there, the smaller shipping companies on the same route would be difficult to compete with and would inevitably fail. Therefore, the smaller shipping companies have also taken immediate action. First, the Ruiping ferry services were united, and then personnel were sent to Ruiping to sign annual packaging contracts with various passengers at low rates, preventing the China Merchants Bureau from gaining a foothold.</p>
<p>China Merchants Bureau Strives The China Merchants Bureau is determined not to give up due to its business interests. Therefore, on the one hand, the Guangji ship was sent to the factory for major repairs, preparing to operate the Ruiping service. On the other hand, it approached Yili Company in Nanshi, intending to lease its new Yili ships at favorable prices to reduce business obstacles. However, this was rejected by Yili and others. The China Merchants Bureau had to find other ships to operate. The Haiyan ship, which originally operated on the route, was superior to other smaller ships in terms of speed and passenger capacity. Therefore, it first competed in passenger transportation. The Haiyan ship only took 28 hours to travel from Wenzhou to Shanghai, while smaller ships in Nanshi took two days and nights. Therefore, most passengers preferred to take the Haiyan, which impacted the business of the smaller ships. As a result, the second struggle ensued.</p>
<p>Ministry of Transportation Orders The Ministry of Transportation recently issued an order to the China Merchants Bureau, stating that according to a petition from various public organizations and people in Yongjia County, the China Merchants Bureau's Haiyan ship is over 60 years old. According to maritime regulations, ships older than 30 years are not allowed to operate. The China Merchants Bureau is using an old and decaying ship to operate between Shanghai and Wenzhou, carrying passengers and treating the lives of the people of Wenzhou as child's play. It should be strictly ordered to suspend service to ensure maritime safety. Upon receiving this order, Liu Hongsheng immediately ordered the shipping department to suspend the Haiyan ship's service, and all its staff were dismissed. In addition to the business staff who were laid off, the navigation and engine personnel, as well as all the sailors, were temporarily retained by the bureau, waiting for vacancies to arise and being given priority for reemployment. However, there are no current positions available, further increasing the number of unemployed. The Xinfeng Ship Changes Course The Haiyan ship's suspension was caused by secret attacks from others. The China Merchants Bureau is therefore more actively competing for the Wenzhou route, determined not to let it be monopolized by a few and easily give up. The Jiahe ship has been temporarily dispatched as a substitute, and the Xinfeng ship from the Northern Ocean route is planned to be transferred to the Wenzhou route. Its speed is faster than the Haiyan, and its passenger capacity is even better. A third wave of competition is bound to occur after this ship starts operating.</p>

<h3>Russian Merchants' Assistance Association Denies Political Purpose</h3>
<p>Claims White Russians are Deliberately Spreading Rumors</p>
<p>Decides to Host Press Today</p>
<p>Dagong News reports that recent newspapers have stated that the Russian Merchants' Assistance Association at No. 2 Beijing Road in the city has a political purpose and is plotting to assassinate the President of the Executive Yuan, Wang Jingwei. Dagong News reporters visited Mr. Xingzilu, the head of the Economic Department of the Association. When asked about the truth, he replied that the news about the Russian Merchants' Assistance Association published in the newspapers a few days ago (30th) was released by Marie Shen, a retired employee who absconded with funds. This news was first published in Russian newspapers in Shanghai and then translated and published in Chinese newspapers. The impact of this news not only affects the Association itself, but also greatly hinders Sino-Russian relations. The Russian newspapers in Shanghai were all founded by White Russians and have always been opposed to the Soviet government. Therefore, they are doing their best to spread malicious propaganda. In addition to engaging in negotiations, the Association is holding a reception for the press at the Duchen Hotel on Simalu (today's Fuzhou Road) tomorrow (i.e., today) to clarify the truth and report on the current state of Sino-Russian trade and the Soviet government's trade policy towards China.</p>
<h3>General Ma Zhanshan Confirms Receipt of Donations Collected on Behalf of the Life Weekly</h3>
<p>Totaling 160,007 Yuan</p>
<p>During General Ma Zhanshan's resistance against Japan, Life Weekly was the first to initiate the collection of donations to assist the patriotic soldiers in Heilongjiang Province. The total amount reached more than 100,000 yuan. Although the company had already announced the collection of donations and published a credit list, distributing it to all sectors of society to show good faith, General Ma published a notice on August 2 in the Shanghai newspapers listing only the amount remitted by a certain bank, without mentioning the names of the remitters. Therefore, the company sent a letter to General Ma to inquire. Now the company has received a reply from General Ma, confirming that there was no error. The original letters from both parties are recorded as follows: ㈠ Letter from Life Weekly to General Ma (excerpt): Our company was the first in Shanghai to initiate fundraising assistance. Fortunately, we had the trust of compatriots from all walks of life and received enthusiastic donations. From November 14, 20th year, to February 18, 21st year, a total of 129,865.09 yuan was collected, plus bank interest of 49.58 yuan, for a total of 129,914.67 yuan. We remitted 120,007 yuan to the general, with the first remittance of 3,000 yuan, the second remittance of 10,000 yuan, the third remittance of 25,000 yuan, and the fourth remittance of 13,500 yuan through the Bank of Communications, totaling 51,500 yuan. The first remittance of 1,600 yuan, the second remittance of 25,000 yuan, the third remittance of 8,797 yuan, the fourth remittance of 2,110 yuan, and the fifth remittance of 30,000 yuan were remitted through the Bank of China, totaling 68,507 yuan, both totaling 120,007 yuan. The remaining amount was 7.3 yuan for telegram fees and 2.72 yuan for ticket fees, leaving a balance of 9,897.65 yuan, which was transferred to the 19th Route Army due to the sudden outbreak of the Shanghai Incident, as the soldiers were fighting hard and urgently needed funds. Our company initiated the collection of these donations to support the anti-Japanese military and encourage the anti-Japanese generals. As the general's location was unknown, there was no way to remit the funds. Therefore, we transferred the above deposit to the 19th Route Army. All funds remitted to the general were acknowledged with receipts signed and sealed by the general in person. All collection and expenditure records of our company have been audited and verified by accountant Pan Xulun to be correct. Our company also printed a credit list and presented it to the general, which we believe the general has already understood. ㈡ General Ma's reply to Life Weekly: In response, I have received the letter and the credit list. I instructed Zhang Qinglu, the special commissioner for receiving慰問款s previously stationed in Harbin, to check the items listed, and all were found to be correct. A special certificate is issued to demonstrate good faith. I especially admire the women of Guangdong in Shanghai who first donated to support the righteous army. I originally planned to give souvenirs for appreciation and remembrance. After preparing them, I will entrust them to you for delivery. Sincerely, Ma Zhanshan, signed and sealed. It is heard that the company still has remaining copies of the credit list available upon request.</p>
<h3>Attention to Those Wishing to Participate in the Chao-Shan National Exhibition</h3>
<p>The Shanghai National Products Factory Federation sent a letter to various factories yesterday, stating, "In accordance with the letter from the Chao-Mei Industry and Commerce Federation, a Chao-Shan National Products Exhibition will be organized and is scheduled to open on September 14th. They have also mailed a tax-free certificate from the Ministry of Industry and a shipping discount voucher, requesting that we inform Shanghai national products manufacturers to participate. After deliberation, it has been decided to register first. The departure and opening dates will be announced after representatives from Chao-Mei come to Shanghai to discuss and decide. For this trip to Shantou and Chaoan to participate in the National Products Exhibition, it has been decided that each industry will be limited to four companies to avoid excessive competition and disorder. All members of the association have priority for registration on a first-come, first-served basis, until the quota is full.) If your factory wishes to participate, please register with the association as soon as possible to avoid missing the opportunity.</p>
<h3>National Silk Exhibition Closes Yesterday</h3>
<p>Representative of the Ministry of Industry Presents Five Suggestions</p>
<p>Hoping the Silk Industry Will Make Improvements</p>
<p>The Chinese National Silk Exhibition, co-organized by the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Silk Industry Bank, the Silk Industry Association, and the Electrical Silk Weaving Factory Association, has been on display since July 10th on the third and fourth floors of the Tianhou Palace Bridge, lasting over fifty days. The exhibition was scheduled to close yesterday afternoon at 2 PM in the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce issued notice to all parties to participate and asked party and government agencies to send people to give speeches. Representatives from hundreds of businesses attended. The Ministry of Industry and the Municipal Government also sent representatives to give instructions. The event is summarized as follows:</p>
<h3>Order of Ceremony</h3>
<p>㈠ Ringing the bell to open the meeting, ㈡ Paying the highest respect to the Party, the national flag, and the portrait of the Premier, ㈢ Chairman respectfully reciting the Premier's will, ㈣ Chairman's speech, ㈤ Vice-Chairman's report on the progress of the exhibition, ㈥ Speech by the representative of the Ministry of Industry, ㈦ Speech by the Mayor, ㈧ Speeches, ㈨ Guided tour, ㈩ Closing.</p>
<h3>Chairman's Speech</h3>
<p>First, Chairman Wang Xiaolai gave a speech, saying, "Today is the closing day of the Chinese National Silk Exhibition. We remember that at the opening last month, the three-day art and recreation event caused a sensation, and tens of thousands of people flocked here. At that time, the weather was extremely hot, but everyone was not afraid of the heat and came to participate. Today, the weather has turned cooler, but the number of guests is not as many as at the opening, which shows that everything in the world depends on people's efforts. The more lively the efforts, the more people will participate. This exhibition was originally sponsored by manufacturers and people from all walks of life, and we have achieved such good results. Because the scheduled period has expired, we are closing today. However, although the closing is only a formality, we will continue to work hard. I hope that everyone's enthusiasm will not also close from now on. Chinese silk relies on rural sericulture. Now, China's rural areas have no way out, and the sericulture industry is particularly declining. The crisis is getting deeper day by day. All those engaged in industry must first find a way out for Chinese silk and a market for cocoons. If we seek this, then our sense of responsibility will never close."</p>
<h3>President's Report</h3>
<p>Next, the association's Vice-President Wang Yansong reported, "Today, China's industry and commerce are declining, and goods cannot be sold smoothly due to the influx of foreign goods. The decline of the silk industry is a fatal blow to China's industry and commerce. The four organizations of this association have prepared the silk exhibition in order to promote domestic silk. The Shanghai Mayor was invited to be the honorary president, and the preparation period was about one month. The exhibition lasted for a total of fifty-two days. Hundreds of manufacturers participated with more than 430 kinds of goods. Special issues were published in five newspapers, including the News Daily, Morning Post, Current Affairs News, China Daily, and Shanghai Business News, to promote the exhibition. The total cost was over 6,000 yuan. At present, more than 4,000 yuan have been moved from the Silk Industry Bank and the Municipal Government, and more than 2,000 yuan are still waiting for assistance from the Social Affairs Bureau and other places. It is estimated that the average number of visitors during the exhibition was more than 5,000 people per day, totaling 300,000 people. These more than 300,000 people have a deep impression of domestic silk. It was originally intended to award various prizes to the manufacturers today, but all the awards from the Ministry of Industry have not yet been issued. They will be sent back after Minister Chen returns to Beijing and then forwarded by each association to the manufacturing plants."</p>
<h3>Instructions from the Ministry of Industry</h3>
<p>Next, Ji Zejin, the special representative of the Ministry of Industry, delivered a speech, saying, "All of you present here are enthusiastic supporters of promoting domestic products. However, we should study why domestic silk cannot be sold well abroad. From my observation, there are several reasons: ㈠ Domestic silk has no uniform standard, such as length and scale are often inconsistent, and the quality of materials also changes, so it is difficult to gain the trust of foreigners. ㈡ Domestic silk is mostly plain and has few prints and bright colors, which is not popular with foreign women and children, so improvements should be made in terms of patterns and colors. ㈢ Domestic silk is too heavy and thick, while foreigners prefer thin and soft materials. ㈣ Chinese people often act alone in foreign trade, with little cooperation and no advertising power to occupy the market. After this, the remedies should be to print the quality, value, color, and style of each product into a booklet so that salesmen can take them to various countries for promotion. ㈤ More domestic products are sold indirectly and fewer are sold directly. They cannot be sold directly from other people's hands. I hope that in the future, we will unite and work together to seek overseas markets."</p>
<h3>Mayor's Instructions</h3>
<p>Next, the Mayor's representative, Pan Gongzhan, gave instructions, saying, "There are two points of this meeting that are deeply worthy of our memory. I hope that everyone will preserve this spirit: ㈠ The products exhibited this time are different from the past. There has been progress in all aspects, whether it is color or material. There are many products that one cannot believe are domestic goods. The effect of the exhibition is to make the public know that domestic goods can also be compared with foreign goods. ㈡ The Silk Industry Bank and other groups have jointly managed this meeting, which is gratifying. From the producers to the sellers, they have worked together. This spirit is unprecedented in other banks. This can be said to be the pioneer. I hope that in the future, not only the banking industry can be like this, but all sectors should uphold this spirit of cooperation to revitalize everything. Then this meeting is not only an exhibition in nature, but can also be a model for the general public."</p>
<h3>Silk Industry Thanks</h3>
<p>Next, Lu Zhengbing, the chairman of the Shanghai Silk Industry Association, gave a speech, saying, "Today is the closing ceremony of the Chinese National Silk Exhibition. We are honored to have representatives from the Party, government, industry, commerce, and academia present to give speeches and instructions. The exhibition of national silk, although co-organized by four organizations, was successfully completed thanks to the financial assistance of Mayor Wu of the Municipal Government and Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau, benefiting the silk industry. I, Lu Zhengbing, as the chairman of the Silk Industry Association, would like to express my gratitude on behalf of the industry. This year is the national goods year designated by all sectors of society. All our compatriots should work hard to promote national goods in order to seek economic prosperity. Now, let us talk about the silk industry alone. We have already realized the spirit of cooperation between the government and the people, that is, to jointly hold the National Silk Exhibition. I think that the silk industry, through this enthusiastic promotion and publicity, directly helps industry and commerce, but indirectly helps the countryside, because our country's rural areas are on the verge of bankruptcy. Therefore, Vice-President Song's establishment of wheat and cotton loans is also for the sake of helping the countryside, but the relief of our silk industry</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>The relief effect is far less grand than that of wheat and cotton loans. I only hope that our compatriots will purchase durable domestic silk for all their needs. I especially hope that party and government officials and leaders from all walks of life will lead by example, so that those above will follow suit, and it will not be difficult to restore the inherent status of the past, and the rural economy will also have considerable achievements."</p>

<h3>Chonghai Qi Five Counties Association Requests Strict Investigation and Arrest of Remaining Gang Members</h3>
<p>丨Letter to the 4th District of the Maritime Public Security Team丨</p>
<p>Since the incident of the Xin Renhe ship of the Yuxing Shipping Company, after the shipowner Sun Xingsheng, the compradors Lang Xihou, Chen Baosheng, the helmsman Chen Yinglong, the crew member Feng Fusheng, and over ten others were sentenced to imprisonment by the Shanghai District Court, the defendants have now declared their dissatisfaction and have filed an appeal. The main reason for the defendants is that all four victims were gang thieves on the Shanghai-Shanhaiguan shipping lines, who openly stole from passengers and merchants. On the 18th and 30th of last month, the detective team of the 4th District of the Maritime Provincial Public Security Team arrested Jin A’er, Wu Keren, Wang Genbao, Xiao Liuzi, Shao Caiqi, Xiao Sanzi, and two unidentified individuals (arrested on the 18th) and Yu Baosheng (leader of the "Little Lion" gang), Zhang Guohua, and Wang Baohui (arrested on the 30th), a total of eleven individuals, on the Maifeng ship of the Jufeng Company. The gang leader Yu Baosheng has confessed that they are affiliated with the four victims of the Xin Renhe incident. The official letter from the Chonghai Qi Five Counties Association to Zhang Xianyi, the district chief of the 4th District of the Jiangsu Maritime Public Security Team, is transcribed below: "To the Director: According to reports from our fellow villagers Lu Renjie and Shi Xiqi, the Shanghai-Shanhaiguan shipping lines are frequently infiltrated by Yangtze River gang thieves who openly steal from passengers and merchants, and use violence. Please forward this letter to the 4th District of the Maritime Public Security to punish the arrested thieves Jin A’er and the other eight to the fullest extent of the law and send them to a vagrant vocational training center after their sentences are completed to prevent them from harming travelers." Based on this, it is found that theft has been rampant on the Shanghai-Qidong shipping line recently, and merchants and passengers are suffering. According to reports from fellow villagers traveling to and from the area, this association has already forwarded letters to your district to strictly investigate the matter. Now that the thieves Jin A’er and others have been arrested, they should be severely punished according to the law to deter violence. The original reporters' request to send them to a vagrant vocational training center after their sentences are completed is a fundamental solution, and their suggestion is very insightful. According to the report of the previous situation, we are enclosing the original documents for your reference. We hope that you will investigate and handle this matter and issue orders to your subordinates to pay close attention to the merchant ships passing through various ports on the Shanghai-Qidong line, arrest the remaining gang members, and prevent them from growing and ensure the safety of travelers. We express our sincere regards to Zhang Xianyi, the district chief of the 4th District of the Jiangsu Maritime Public Security Team."</p>
<h3>Ou Weiguo Accused of Occupying Common Property</h3>
<p>丨Defendant Went to Guangdong for Postponement of Further Interrogation丨</p>
<p>Ou Tan Huiran, the mother of Ou Weiguo, a Cantonese deputy manager of the Shanghai Bank, currently residing at No. 4 Dasheng Hutong, Lane 153, Route Haig, French Concession (also known as the wife of Ou Bin), together with fellow villagers Ye Danci (wife of dentist Ye Jingfu), Situ Chenxin, Li Zhaolanfang, Chen Ruihua, Zhao Xiaosi, and others, jointly invested 30,000 yuan (divided into 60 shares of 500 yuan each) in 1923 to establish the Women's Real Estate Company. They purchased a piece of land of ten acres behind Bazishan in Jiangwan Township, Baoshan County. After the purchase, Ou Tan Huiran, representing the Women's Real Estate Company, entrusted the British company Telifield &amp; Co. to transfer the title deeds to British Registration No. 709. After Ou's mother, Tan Huiran, passed away from illness in October 1924, all the properties of the Women's Real Estate Company were inherited and managed by Ou Weiguo. In 1928, Ou Weiguo took out the title deeds from Telifield &amp; Co., but he hid the deeds and refused to return them to the Women's Real Estate Company. Ye Danci, Situ Chenxin, and others repeatedly negotiated with Ou and even sent letters of demand through lawyers, but Ou ignored them. Ye Danci and others then hired lawyers to file a lawsuit in the Civil Division of the Second Special Court, accusing Ou Weiguo of occupying common property and requesting a judgment to hand over the property for joint management. After receiving the complaint, the court summoned the plaintiffs yesterday morning in the Civil Division No. 6, presided over by Judge Rao. The plaintiffs were represented by lawyer Liang Bingyao, who stated the case. The defendant was represented by lawyer Xi Shichang, who stated that the defendant had gone to Guangdong for business and requested a postponement. The court decided to set a date for further interrogation.</p>
<h3>Linwushanren Passed Away</h3>
<p>Mr. Bu Xiangfen, a famous scholar from Henan, styled Zhang Wu, and with the pseudonym Linwushanren, was intelligent and talented since childhood. He was known as a child prodigy. He was well-versed in all kinds of books and was skilled in classical Chinese prose, especially poetry. He entered the local school in his childhood, and in his twenties, he was recommended for the provincial examination. Later, he served in Yuan Shikai's staff as a secretary in the presidential palace for several years. After Yuan Shikai passed away, Mr. Bu came to Shanghai to live in seclusion, enjoying poetry and prose, and not seeking fame. He was fond of opera and was acquainted with people in the opera world. In recent years, he had taken in as many as two hundred actresses, enjoying the joy of being surrounded by beautiful women. Since the beginning of this summer, he suddenly suffered from a firewood-gathering disease [a metaphor for hardship]. Recently, his illness suddenly worsened, and medicine was ineffective. He passed away on the first day of this month. Another literary elder has passed away, and those who heard the news all mourned his loss. His remains are temporarily placed in the Chinese Funeral Home, and the date of the funeral will be determined after his family arrives from Henan. Xu Qianlin, Yi Junzhai, Chen Anbo, Shan Zhongfan, Feng Shuluan, Luo Tieshen, Zheng Zibao, and other gentlemen are responsible for handling the funeral affairs.</p>
<h3>Court Summer Vacation Ends</h3>
<p>Office Hours Return to Normal</p>
<p>Shen Jiayi, President of the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, and Wang Zhennan, Chief Prosecutor, announced that with the end of the summer vacation, office hours should return to normal. Starting yesterday, except for Sundays and holidays, work will begin at 8:00 AM and end at 12:00 PM, and resume from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

<h3>Vehicles Causing Accidents Should Be Reported Immediately</h3>
<p>The "Shanghai Evening Post" reports that personnel from the Public Concession Police Department's Traffic Division urge all drivers in Shanghai to pay attention: if involved in a traffic accident, they must immediately report to the nearby police or the Traffic Division. Even if they witness a traffic accident and are not directly involved, they should still stop and report to the police. This is their responsibility to the public. According to the traffic regulations, any vehicle directly involved in an accident must stop to assist the victims and report to the police. Violators will be punished. Recently, there have been cases where drivers have not stopped to report the accident and have been found out later, resulting in the car owners being charged and punished. Drivers are urged to pay attention to this.</p>
<h3>Xiang Xiasheng Died From Serious Injuries</h3>
<p>Xiang Xiasheng from Ningbo, on the evening of August 23rd at 9:00 PM, together with the fugitives A’e, Chen Xi, Zhang Quan, Xiao Biao, and others, shot and wounded his fellow villager Yan Azhang (also known as Li Azhang) in the back in a remote area of Guiyang Road, and then pushed him into a small creek, hoping to murder him. After the incident, Chen Ruhai, a Chinese detective of the Yangshupu Police Station, arrested Xiang and handed him over to Judge Wu Zehan for further interrogation. Zhang Tianyin, the lawyer for the police station, stated the case, saying that the victim, Li Azhang, died in Shengxin Hospital at 10:00 AM on November 26th due to his injuries. The cause of death was that the bullet entered his back from his waist. Although the doctor removed the bullet through surgery, he could not defecate, leading to his death. It has been investigated that when these people committed the crime, they first lured Li to a dark and empty place, and then Xiao Biao and the other three surrounded Li on all sides, preventing him from escaping. A’e fired a shot, but the gun only had one bullet left. Otherwise, they would have continued to fire, fearing that he would not die from only one shot. They also took off his pants and pushed him into the creek to cover up their tracks. Their methods were cruel and their intentions were malicious. It was not to reclaim the stolen pistol. It was suspected that the victim had informed the police about Chen Xi's previous kidnapping case, resulting in resentment. At that time, they forcibly borrowed 30 yuan from the victim and, when they were refused, they gathered a gang to shoot him. The pistol did not belong to the deceased. Li Wangshi, the mother of the deceased, complained that Li Azhang was her son. After he was injured, she went to the hospital to visit him. He claimed that he was shot because he refused to lend money. When questioned, the defendant denied gathering a gang to shoot and assassinate him. After Judge Wu verified the confession, he ordered him to be remanded in custody and set a date for sentencing.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>I have read today's issue of your newspaper with the headline "Direct Train Service Between Shanghai and Pingjin Starts Tomorrow" in the local news column, and detailed information on the arrival and departure times of the trains, "The northbound train departs from Shanghai at [blank] o'clock," and "The southbound train arrives in Shanghai at 0:25 AM." After investigation, the direct train service between Shanghai and Pingjin is temporarily not direct. The northbound train on the Jinpu Line departs from Shanghai North Station at 12:00 AM, and the southbound train arrives in Shanghai at 11:55 PM. The information published in your newspaper is incorrect and presumably based on inaccurate information. Therefore, I would like to request that your newspaper make corrections immediately to avoid misunderstanding among passengers. This letter is addressed to the chief editor of the Shen Bao. Carried by the Shanghai-Nanjing-Ningbo Railway Bureau, August 31.</p>

<p>Survival After Calamity</p>
<h3>Famous Generals from the Northeast Arrive in Shanghai Together</h3>
<p>Fu Baolu Yu Xiwei Wang Mingshen Wu Jingyao</p>
<p>Shanghai's Track and Field Strength Doubled in the National Games</p>
<p>The former five tiger women generals (Sun Guiyun, Wu Meixian, Liu Jingzhen, Wang Yuan, Xiao Shuling) from Harbin shocked the country. On the men's side, Fu Baolu set the highest national pole vault record with 3.54 meters. In recent North China Games and Hangzhou National Games, Yu Xiwei, a middle-distance runner from Dalian, and Wang Mingshen and Wu Jingyao, short-distance and long-distance runners from Liaoning, have repeatedly shown their skills and are famous throughout the country. They are the most memorable figures in China's track and field circles. However, since the fall of the Northeast, the athletes have been in danger and under strict surveillance by pseudo-organizations. Therefore, their news has been lost for a long time. Recently, they suddenly escaped from the tiger's mouth and came to Shanghai to study together, and plan to represent Shanghai in the National Games. This is really gratifying. Here are the latest developments of each person:</p>
<h3>Fu Baolu</h3>
<p>Fu is the record holder for the pole vault in our country, and recently unofficially reached a height of 3.80 meters, which is amazing. He also said that in this year's National Games, it is not difficult to break through 3.60 meters. He has now arrived in Shanghai and plans to seek a part-time job to continue his studies on the one hand, and to maintain his livelihood on the other. He plans to represent Shanghai in the Nanjing National Games.</p>
<h3>Yu Xiwei</h3>
<p>Last year, there was a plan to send Yu and Liu Changchun to represent our country at the 10th World Games, but Yu could not escape the cage at that time, and did not get his wish. Now Yu has also arrived in Shanghai and plans to study in Shanghai. His highest record for 800 meters is 2 minutes and 2 seconds. If the field is good, he can make 2 minutes. The 1500 meters is around 4 minutes and 15 seconds, which is valuable. He also plans to represent Shanghai in the National Games.</p>
<h3>Wang Mingshen</h3>
<p>Wang is a famous middle-distance runner, comparable to Yu Xiwei. He currently holds the national record for 800 meters at 2 minutes 6.8 seconds, and the 1500 meters is about 4 minutes and 25 seconds. He has arrived in Shanghai and plans to represent Shanghai in the National Games, but must continue his studies.</p>
<h3>Wu Jingyao</h3>
<p>During the 15th North China Games in Jinan, Wu Jun first emerged in the intermediate group, winning three championships in the 100m, 100m, and 400m events. The results were quite outstanding, and he was known as the second Liu Changchun. However, times have changed, and due to environmental factors, he failed to continue to add glory to the North China Games. His recent results are 11.6 seconds for 100m and 23.8 seconds for 200m. He is a new short-distance runner. Today, he and Yu Xiwei and others arrived in Shanghai, and plan to represent Shanghai in the National Games.</p>
<h3>National Sports Association Convened a Meeting of Representatives from Various Regions</h3>
<p>The term of office of the directors and standing committee members of the Chinese National Sports Association has expired. According to the regulations, the National Congress of Representatives should be convened to elect the successors. The Board of Directors decided on August 3, 20th year, to convene the National Congress of Representatives in Beijing at the time of the National Games, in accordance with the National Games method, with the province and special city as the unit, to discuss the development of association affairs. Due to the impact of the situation, the National Games were postponed, and the association was also adjourned. This year's National Games are scheduled to be held in Beijing on the Double Tenth Festival. The association has also decided to convene a representative conference in Beijing during the National Games, and has sent letters to the sports bureaus of various provinces and cities and sports figures, requesting them to send one representative to attend the meeting.</p>
<h3>Takahashi 2000 Meter Sea Swim to be Held Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Enthusiastic Participation</p>

For safety, the organizers have prepared six lifeboats and one speedboat, each equipped with four lifebuoys and one rescuer.

All those who swim to the finish within fifty minutes will receive award flags and medals.

<h3>American Baseball Home Run King Babe Ruth Hopes to Become a Manager</h3>
<p>Leg Injury Hinders Running</p>
<p>To End Competition After This Season</p>
<p>(New York, August 31, Reuters) American baseball home run king Babe Ruth, known to all, intends to end his career as a baseball player and pursue a managerial position. He stated, "This season will be my last. After this, I will give up my playing position and hope to become a manager of a team." Ruth was once surpassed by his rival, Jimmy Foxx, but soon regained his title as king. Ruth is an excellent pitcher, but his outstanding hitting skills have led him to play as an outfielder. However, since injuring his leg last year, although he has shown remarkable performances, his running has been hindered, leading him to seek another path and announce his intention to become a manager.</p>
<h3>Patriotic Girls' School Expands Sports Field</h3>
<p>The Patriotic Girls' School has the earliest established and most successful physical education program. Its graduates are distributed both domestically and abroad, numbering over a thousand. Since hiring physical education expert Li Jiyuan as the director of the physical education department in the first half of the year, the school has further strengthened the program. Both indoor and outdoor activities are conducted with earnest training, aiming to advance both theory and technique, and to create excellent and well-rounded physical education teachers. The construction of dormitories, a gymnasium, and a music classroom this semester has been reported previously. As the existing sports field is deemed too small to meet the needs, the school has acquired additional land to the west of the campus to create a sports field. All track and field events and other sports equipment can be arranged abundantly.</p>

<h3>A Dual-Purpose Machine for Learning Morse Code and Testing Vacuum Tubes</h3>
<p>— Yi Zhi</p>
<p>Friends who enjoy listening to or working with radio technology, do you aspire to become a radio operator or a radio technician? Then you should quickly practice sending and receiving Morse code. Code substitutes for language and can be transmitted through radio to send messages. Code also has unique advantages: the transmitter for sending code is simpler in construction than a voice transmitter, and the transmission distance is several times greater than that of a voice transmitter. Because of its special and impressive efficiency, all countries in the world use it to transmit messages. Learning to send and receive code is not difficult. As long as you memorize the code and practice sending and receiving for about two to three months, you will surely succeed. Receiving foreign telegrams is as easy as listening to the radio, and sending code is also very convenient. Whether you are hundreds or thousands of miles apart, it is as if you are together, speaking face-to-face. What an interesting experience!</p>
<p>There are usually two types of machines for learning to send and receive code: one uses a buzzer and the other uses an audio frequency oscillator. The sound of the former is weaker and the tone is inferior to the latter, but it also has its advantages: it is cheaper and easier to use. The latter, using an audio frequency oscillator, requires a vacuum tube and an audio frequency transformer to be properly matched to create oscillation. In the oscillation circuit, a key is connected in series. Pressing and releasing the key emits a buzzing sound, just like a telegram, for practicing sending and receiving.</p>
<p>This code learning device is also a dual-purpose machine for testing vacuum tubes. It is powered by AC electricity, which makes it small, consumes little power, and is convenient to use. This machine is very easy to assemble. Most of the components required are probably already available to radio enthusiasts, so it is very economical. The required materials are listed below:</p>
<p>One 227 vacuum tube</p>
<p>One 201A vacuum tube</p>
<p>One power transformer</p>
<p>One audio frequency transformer</p>
<p>One key</p>
<p>Two 2MFD filter capacitors</p>
<p>One 30H choke coil</p>
<p>One headset or speaker</p>
<p>One four-pin tube socket</p>
<p>One five-pin tube socket</p>
<p>One 2.5V small light bulb</p>
<p>Plugs, screws, and wiring</p>
<p>Once all the components are ready, you can start assembling. The wiring diagram is shown in Figure 1. V1 is a 227 tube, V2 is a 201A tube (I71, 280, etc. tubes can also be used), T is the power transformer, T1 is the audio frequency transformer, K is the key, C1C2 are filter capacitors, L is the choke coil (a burnt audio frequency transformer can be used with its secondary coil to replace it), P is the headset, L.S. is the speaker, R is a variable resistor, and B is a small light bulb.</p>
<p>After connecting all the wires according to Figure 1, plug the plug into a 220-volt or 110-volt power line. Press and release the key and gradually reduce the resistance until you hear a sound similar to a telegram in the headset or speaker. If there is no sound in the headset or speaker, there must be a wiring error. Unplug the plug from the power line, carefully check the circuit for errors, and then try reversing the two wires of the audio frequency transformer. If there is still no sound, the 227 tube may be too old and has lost its efficiency, so it cannot oscillate. Try replacing it with a new one.</p>
<p>Based on the above principle, testing whether a vacuum tube oscillates can determine its efficiency. The testing method is the same as above. Insert a new vacuum tube, reduce the variable resistance until you hear a sound in the headset or speaker. Remove the new vacuum tube and insert the vacuum tube to be tested. Test it in the same way to see if it can also oscillate. Increase or decrease the resistance to determine its efficiency. If you want to determine the efficiency accurately, the resistor should be wire-wound and labeled with numbers like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, etc. for easy recording, as shown in Figure 2. This method can also be used to test tetrodes or pentodes. Just slightly adjust the wiring on the V1 vacuum tube socket or change the key to open and close it. The wiring diagrams are shown in Figures 3 and 4, one for testing tetrodes and one for testing pentodes.</p>
<h3>Essential Knowledge for Long-Distance Radio Reception</h3>
<p>— Li Yuanqing</p>
<p>In America, a seventeen-year-old boy can receive broadcasts from all over the world (41 countries, 694 stations) with a very ordinary two-tube radio. However, some people use fifteen-tube radios and cannot cross the Atlantic. Someone in Nanjing can hear Japanese broadcasts with a crystal radio, but someone else in the same location uses an eight-tube superheterodyne radio and cannot receive Shanghai broadcasts. Therefore, the distance a radio can receive is not entirely dependent on the quality of the radio itself. It is also closely related to other factors. The following points are very important.</p>
<p>1.  Raise and lengthen the antenna. The lead-in wire should preferably be connected directly to the antenna (see "Improved Single-Wire Antenna" in Issue 5 of this publication). Otherwise, it must be soldered. The ground wire should be as deep as possible. (Note: The higher the antenna, the better, but it should not be too long. Too long an antenna will have poor selectivity and more noise. It is best to keep it between 100 and 150 feet.)</p>
<p>2.  Vacuum tubes must be replaced after one year or 1,000 hours of use. Whether a vacuum tube is damaged internally is not determined by whether it lights up or not. Do not buy cheap, no-name vacuum tubes.</p>
<p>3.  Even vacuum tubes of the same brand and manufacturer will not have exactly the same characteristics. Some are suitable for detection, while others are suitable for amplification. When using them, they should be rotated in the radio to achieve the best performance.</p>
<p>4.  The voltage of each electrode of each vacuum tube must be according to the specified values. Too high or too low is not appropriate.</p>
<p>5.  The grid leak of the detector tube is best to be variable. Otherwise, several resistors with different values must be prepared. When receiving distant broadcasts, a 2 megohm grid leak is often too small and should be replaced with a 3.5 megohm grid leak.</p>
<p>6.  Adding a regeneration coil to the radio will greatly improve its sensitivity. Adding one or two stages of high-frequency amplification will have an even more unexpected effect.</p>
<p>7.  Adding a 1/2 mfd fixed capacitor between the earphone end and B+ and B- can increase the sensitivity of the radio and improve the sound quality.</p>
<p>8.  The sensitivity of the earphone or speaker is also very important. Many poorly made speakers or earphones can only receive local or loud broadcasts. Weak signals cannot make them produce sound.</p>
<p>9.  The distance a radio can receive is shorter during the day than at night, worse in summer than in winter, and shorter in the tropics than in cold regions, shorter in cities than in the countryside.</p>
<p>10. Radio waves from distant locations travel a long distance and are prone to fading (new radios with automatic volume control can avoid this). Therefore, receiving distant broadcasts requires patience. At the same time, considerable training is required in tuning.</p>
<h3>Simple Antennas</h3>
<p>— Zhu Ziyuan</p>
<p>I have tried both of the following simple antennas, and the effect is no different from that of an outdoor antenna. I am writing about them here so that you can try them out.</p>
<p>A. Using a telephone line as an antenna is extremely simple. Simply connect the telephone wire entering the house to the antenna terminal of the radio with a piece of rubber wire. However, it is important to connect a 0.001 to 0.005 microfarad fixed capacitor in series here. Otherwise, the telephone will not work, as shown in Figure 1.</p>
<p>B. Using a power line as an antenna. There are three ways to connect it, as shown in Figures 2A, B, and C.</p>
<p>A is to use only one of the power lines. The best one to use must be determined by experimentation.</p>
<p>B is to use both wires as an antenna.</p>
<p>C is to not use a ground wire.</p>
<p>I think method A is the best of these three methods, and method C is the worst. In method C, the capacitor must be able to withstand high voltage, and the capacitance is from 0.002 to 2 microfarads.</p>
<p>When I tested the above two simple antennas with a regenerative single-tube radio in Songjiang, there was no difference from the outdoor antenna. At night, I could also listen to K2RM's light and clear Western music. If a comrade testing a transmitter wants to listen to broadcasts from other places at the same time, then they can install one less outdoor antenna.</p>
<p>If you encounter a time when tuning is not sensitive, you can add an extra coil and a variable capacitor (please refer to Q.S.P. Magazine, Volume 2, Issue 1). I will not discuss it in detail here.</p>
<h3>Shortwave Transmitter Tuning Method and Steps (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Luo Jingyu</p>
<p>(D) Plate-Grid Resonance: This type of circuit also uses capacitive coupling; however, it relies on the capacitance (C3 in the figure) between the plate and grid of the vacuum tube itself to feed the plate current back to the grid and cause oscillation.</p>
<p>Because the capacitance of the vacuum tube itself is very small and the feedback energy is not high, it is suitable for general shortwave transmitters. Also, because its capacitance is fixed inside the vacuum tube and cannot be adjusted at will to determine the ratio of excitation between the plate and grid, C2 is specially placed in the grid circuit in Figure 3 for control. When we perform tuning, first set C1 to half (that is, at the 50-degree mark on the dial), then rotate C2 from zero degrees gradually increasing, while the reading on the plate milliammeter AIP also gradually increases. When C2 is rotated to a certain degree, the plate current reading suddenly drops from its maximum to zero. If C2 is further rotated, the plate current gradually increases again, and when it reaches a certain degree, it again drops from its maximum to zero. The point where the plate current drops is the best standard point for the oscillation situation we want to obtain. However, in practical applications, the grid C2 is usually slightly increased in degrees to keep the plate current 10% higher than the minimum to ensure the stability of the wavelength. Also, after changing the grid capacitance C2, the wave-determining C2 must also be adjusted accordingly, otherwise the wavelength will not match the original one.</p>
<p>As for the other circuits, because they are generally derived from these three main circuits, although some places are different, the main principles can be inferred from this. The tuning procedure is only slightly different in terms of complexity. Also, during the tuning process, it is advisable to use a wavemeter to check at any time, otherwise it will be a waste of effort if you succeed but do not achieve the goal. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>A Collection of Vacuum Tubes (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Ke Ming</p>
<p>Tetrodes have the disadvantage of excessive regeneration due to the grid-screen capacitance, but it can be reduced or eliminated by several methods. One method is to use complex circuitry and coordination to generate a reaction that balances the coupling between the grid and the screen. A second and better method is to minimize the grid-screen capacitance within the tube itself. This can be accomplished by inserting a fourth electrode called a screen grid inside the tube. The screen grid is placed between the plate and the grid, thus forming a tetrode. Using this type of tube eliminates the need for complex circuits and balancing difficulties. Since the screen voltage can effectively control the flow of electrons, small changes in the plate voltage will not significantly affect the plate current. This is important for stability. The structure of the screen grid does not substantially block the electron flow, but it provides an electrostatic shield between the plate and the grid. The voltage of the screen grid is a positive voltage lower than the plate voltage and is connected to the cathode via a capacitor branch. This bypass capacitor introduces the screen grid current or high-frequency current to the ground and minimizes the grid-screen capacitance. Generally, the grid-screen capacitance of an average triode is 8.0 MMF, while in a screen grid tube, it can be reduced to 0.01 MMF or even less. As a result of the reduction, the stable amplification of a screen grid tube can exceed that of a triode many times over. Representative tubes of this type are 24丨A, '32, and '35.</p>
<p>Pentodes: In various radio tubes, when electrons strike the plate at considerable speed, some electrons can be ejected from the plate. In diodes or triodes, this ejection of electrons does not pose a problem because there is no other positive electrode in the tube besides the plate itself to attract them; they are ultimately collected back by the plate. The electrons emitted from the plate after being struck by electrons from the cathode are called secondary emission. The term "secondary" distinguishes them from the electrons originally emitted by the cathode. In screen grid tubes, the screen grid also has a positive voltage close to the plate voltage, which attracts the secondary electrons, especially when the plate voltage drops below the screen voltage. This results in a reduction of the plate current and limits the rise and fall of the tetrode's plate voltage.</p>
<p>To eliminate the limitation of plate current, a fifth electrode called a suppressor grid is added between the screen and the plate, thus creating a pentode. The suppressor grid is usually connected to the cathode. Because it is at a negative potential relative to the plate, it prevents the ejection of secondary electrons and redirects them back to the plate, where they do not cause any problems. Currently, the design of the suppressor grid in pentodes can be divided into two functions. In power output pentodes, the suppressor grid can maximize the power output and gain of the pentode because the plate voltage can have extremely large swings. Representative tubes of this type are '33, '38, and '47. In high-frequency amplification pentodes, the suppressor grid can achieve high voltage amplification at normal plate voltages. In fact, the plate voltage can be as low as or even lower than the screen voltage without significantly losing the possible amount of gain. These tubes can be represented by '34 and '39. The design of the tube, with the suppressor grid also connected to the outside of the base, can yield additional benefits and applications. Because of this, it is possible to change the voltage applied to the suppressor grid to achieve special control purposes. Standard tubes of this type are 57 and 58. (End)</p>
<h3>Domestic and Foreign News</h3>
<p>The US Five-Tube Radio Achieves Amazing Results: Kangmao Radio Company has received a large shipment of five-tube US radios. The sound is exceptionally loud and clear, even surpassing that of other seven-tube models. It is reported that the new stock is about to be sold out, with only six units remaining. Those who wish to purchase should do so quickly.</p>
<h3>Introduction to Repair Services</h3>
<p>Is your radio damaged? Does it need inspection and repair? If you lack the basic knowledge of radio repair, do not attempt to disassemble and repair it yourself, as this may cause further damage to important parts of the radio. Also, do not rashly send it to an unfamiliar repair shop, as repair shops often charge exorbitant prices, claiming that certain parts need to be completely replaced, even if the damage is not significant, thus increasing the repair costs. There are many well-known radio repair shops in Shanghai, such as Dahua, Zhonghua, Jianhua, Xin Ya, Ya Sheng, Ya Da, and Ya Mei, all of which have good reputations. This publication is happy to introduce them. However, to better serve our readers, this publication has recently made a special arrangement with Kangmao Radio Company at 47 Ningbo Road to set up a free inspection department. Readers of this newspaper who have a radio that is unfortunately damaged can cut out this advertisement and send the radio to Kangmao Radio Company for inspection. The inspection department will identify the location of the damage in detail and estimate the repair costs. The inspection is completely free. Kangmao Radio Company has an established repair department with original spare parts and employs expert repair technicians. It has long enjoyed a good reputation and can be considered one of the best. Therefore, this publication has made a special arrangement to provide free inspection services for our readers.</p>

<h3>How to Repair Damaged Headphones</h3>
<p>— RF</p>
<p>Headphones are easily damaged if not used carefully, resulting in weak sound or complete silence. The following describes the repair methods for those who wish to repair them themselves.</p>
<p>(1) Demagnetization: Headphones that have lost their magnetism produce faint sound. The remedy is to remagnetize them. The method is to take out the permanent magnet inside and wind it with 100 to 200 turns of No. 18 silk-covered wire, then pass a current from a 6-volt storage battery for about one second. Then, reinstall it as it was, and the sound should be as loud as usual. (The wiring and connection of electricity should be as shown in the figure. The N pole in the figure is the pole that attracts the south-pointing needle of a compass. If there is no storage battery, dry batteries or the current used to replace the A battery that can supply a large current can also be used.)</p>
<p>(2) Diaphragm Damage: Headphones with a damaged diaphragm produce rough sound. You need to replace it with a new diaphragm to improve the sound. You can replace it with a soft iron sheet of the same thickness and size. (If you cannot find a soft iron sheet for the time being, you can cut a thin iron sheet from a 50-cigarette tin or a high-quality biscuit tin to replace it.)</p>
<p>(3) Broken Wire: Headphones with a broken wire produce no sound after being energized or may have occasional popping sounds. You can first use a multimeter to check where the break is. If the broken wire is silk-covered soft wire, you can replace the broken wire with the cord wire used for electric lamps. If the broken wire is the fine enamel wire inside the earphone, you can remove all the broken wire and replace it with No. 44 enamel wire in the original pattern.</p>
<h3>Common Sense</h3>
<p>— Huang Jiancun</p>
<p>(14) Detector Circuit</p>
<p>(1) Meaning of Detection: When an external radio wave is absorbed by the antenna, a radio-frequency current will inevitably be generated in the antenna. To enable the headphones to fully perform their sound-receiving function, it is necessary to first decompose the radio-frequency current generated in the antenna and extract the audio-frequency current contained therein. The device that performs this function is called a detector.</p>
<p>(2) Detector: In the detector circuit, the most important component is the detector, whose function is detection. There are many types of detectors. Branly invented a type of Coherer detector in 1892, which consists of a metal tube filled with metal electrodes and metal powder (a mixture of nickel and silver powder) between the metal electrodes. When a radio wave arrives, the incomplete contact between the metal particles immediately becomes complete contact. This effect is used for detection. Marconi used it for radio communication at the time. It was the ancestor of detectors, but this type of detector is no longer used. Currently, the most commonly used types are crystal detectors and vacuum tube detectors. Radios that use crystals for detection are called crystal radios, while those that use vacuum tubes for detection are called vacuum tube radios.</p>
<p>(3) Crystal Detector: A crystal that performs detection is called a crystal detector. The operation of the crystal detector is explained in the diagram above. As shown in the diagram, because a radio-frequency current passes through the antenna, a high-frequency voltage is generated at both ends of the coil, so the current also flows into the crystal. However, the current flowing into the crystal only flows in one direction. This is because the crystal detector has a unidirectional characteristic. The so-called unidirectional characteristic means that the flow of current is limited to one direction, and it cannot flow in the other direction. Thus, only a half-wave current flows into the headphones, so the diaphragm of the headphones must vibrate with the strength of the current and ultimately move with the audio current contained in the external radio wave.</p>

<h3>River Management Discourse</h3>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>The Yellow River in Shandong Province had its water level suddenly drop due to breaches in the provinces of Hebei and Henan, and it could be considered out of danger. Unexpectedly, the river suddenly breached in eighteen locations at Shitou Village, with the water all returning to the main river. This caused a rapid rise in the torrent in the middle reaches, even exceeding the highest water level, a new record for the month. According to River Bureau Director Zhang Lianjia, the water in the Shouzhang and Fanxian areas crossed the northern bank's Golden Dike, reaching eighteen inches. Although rescue efforts are underway, the danger has not yet passed. How terrifying is this "flood disaster"?</p>
<p>I think that when the divine Yu managed the waters in ancient times, he first dredged the Dragon Gate, then guided the Jishi, and then breached the Ru and Han, draining the Huai and Si. Looking at the sequence of his work, it was simply about following the nature of the water, allowing the rolling torrent to flow into the sea! And the overwhelming floods in ancient China were thus calmed, allowing our people to live in peace, without having to live together with the aquatic creatures. This is all thanks to the great achievements of King Yu. Now, the officials managing the river, I dare to boldly say, are "imitating Bai Gui's old tricks," hastily building several dikes and adding a few embankments when faced with imminent danger, considering it to be the limit of human effort. Therefore, when the Yellow River breaches and floods in the autumn, we hear the news every year. Alas! This is a "man-made disaster," not attributable to the natural world. Yet, people knit their brows in anger, calling it a "natural disaster." I fear that if Heaven knew, it would truly be unbearable!</p>
<p>Why do I say this? Try to look through the river management history that we can see. Not to mention the distant past, let's talk about the recent past. The so-called "river works" item, I don't know how much money is spent during the alarm period. And what is the result later? Alas! It is a major leak in the nation's finances. And from the perspective of officialdom, it has become a huge source of incalculable profits. This is not an exaggeration on my part. In fact, the writings of the predecessors clearly show this, leaving no room for denial. Later, although there are defense projects and relief preparation plans, they can all be said to be last-minute efforts. Considering them to be "treating the symptoms" is not enough. Where does the method of "treating the root cause" begin?</p>
<p>The reason lies in the first step of "not understanding the source." Therefore, in the transition between summer and autumn, there is often accumulated rain and lurking floods, with the force of a thousand miles in one go. Moreover, there are countless places where dikes and embankments collapse. People don't pay attention to it on weekdays, and wait until the water flows freely, inundating countless fields and crops, and then urgently report the disaster. You! Think, is it still in time? The second step, if you want to avoid river disasters, lies in "filling and building" and "excavating." Then, you need to purchase the latest machines to achieve even the slightest effect. Sending a few technicians will not have much power to show to the affected people. Third, even if you have "capable officials," you still need extraordinary amounts of money to achieve world-shaking achievements. May I ask, can the current government, with its depleted national currency, afford to spend so much at once, while the benefits can last for generations? Therefore, "river disasters" are not only a major problem for our country at present, but I believe they will also be a major problem in the future. It is necessary to plan a permanent solution to the problem.</p>
<h3>Autumn Colors</h3>
<p>— Qian Taisheng</p>
<p>Autumn has arrived, hasn't it? The thermometer has dropped from ninety-eight degrees to seventy-three.</p>
<p>In fruit stores, there are more and more bunches of purple-black rose grapes, marked at thirty-five copper coins apiece. Not a penny less. They're the new season's goods, why wouldn't they be holding "premium prices"?</p>
<p>Red flesh, black seeds, green-skinned watermelons, shouting loudly in the middle of the street:</p>
<p>"Three copper coins a slice! Fresh, sweet, cool watermelon!"</p>
<p>Autumn has arrived, but watermelons should still be eaten sparingly! That shouting assistant, he doesn't even have the strength to squeeze a fist! Look! Look at the way he's shouting!</p>
<p>Ginkgo nuts are on the market! A broken iron wok, a big pile of broken ceramic pieces, using a small spatula, shoveling inside the broken iron wok. Listen:</p>
<p>"Clang, clang, singing, clang, clang, singing, dismantling lalala......"</p>
<p>A small yellow clay stove, a small iron wire basket with small holes, grabbing a handful of wet ginkgo nuts, turning around, the spatula in his hand shoveling the ceramic pieces. Listen to the assistant sing:</p>
<p>"Fragrant is fragrant, glutinous is glutinous, three copper coins for one, one grain blooms, two grains grow big (pronounced tuo)......"</p>
<p>In the broken wok, ceramic pieces grabbing ceramic pieces, an iron spatula hitting the iron wok, the sound is:</p>
<p>"Dismantling lalala, clang, clang, singing, dismantling lalala......" Poetic rhythm, dramatic air, isn't the melody simple and beautiful? It's truly street mime, the sounds of autumn in the city!</p>
<p>Big store signs, big red paper flying characters, Yan style or Zhao style? Writing:</p>
<p>"New Autumn Mooncakes on the Market"</p>
<p>Guangdong mooncakes, local mooncakes, it's only the beginning of the seventh lunar month. By the Mid-Autumn Festival, when "the moon is especially bright," I'm afraid the tips of people's tongues will be tired of eating them. Truly city dwellers who are rushing to the early market!</p>
<p>Tianjin "Liangxiang" chestnuts, in the sweet, greasy calling of fresh lotus root, Tianjin apples, deep brown-yellow chestnuts, in that big iron wok, exuding a charming fragrance, that rich starch and red sugar fragrance that hooks the hungry urban crowd, is truly enough to make people endure!</p>
<h3>Supporting Role</h3>
<p>— Lin Ying</p>
<p>It was an early autumn evening.</p>
<p>At Mr. Lin's wedding banquet, Miss Nen, the bridesmaid, always showed boredom and depression.</p>
<p>"Alas! Today is truly extremely meaningless, a whole day!" she said in a low voice.</p>
<p>"It's very meaningful!"</p>
<p>I said, not expecting her mood.</p>
<p>"Always playing the supporting role! Ah."</p>
<p>"Do you want to play the leading role? Girl!" A golden, strong wine was shimmering in front of her.</p>
<p>"Oh! Who cares!"</p>
<p>In her rosy cheeks, the strong wine moistened her red lips.</p>
<h3>No Matter How You Are......Always......</h3>
<p>— Ren</p>
<p>No matter how lively you are, after death, you will never be alive again. You must listen to the barber's manipulation with all your attention. No matter how shy you are, when you take a bath in a public bathhouse, there is no way to think about it.</p>
<p>No matter how impatient you are, you can't do anything if you meet a slow doctor.</p>
<p>No matter how lazy you are, you always have to do it, pulling your stool and draining your urine. No matter how slow you are, when it's time to get on the train? You always have to run a few steps in a hurry.</p>
<h3>Beautiful Dusk</h3>
<p>— Zhang Bai'ou</p>
<p>Unwilling to let down this beautiful dusk, I ran out of the study I had been living in for a day, and expressed boundless reveries to the setting sun that was about to sink below the horizon. It was not until its tip, like the tongue of a wheel-like flame, became thin red clouds that my sight was drawn back from the sky to a rural village surrounded by trees and water. On the roofs and treetops of that rural village, layers of dark-green illusory clouds were piled up, constantly changing into images of everything on earth. There were craggy mountain peaks, terraced pavilions, and undulating fierce beasts, which were vividly described in Gu Kaizhi's poem: "Summer clouds have many strange peaks." When experiencing it personally, I feel that the poet's inspiration is particularly richer than that of ordinary people, giving us the joy of depicting and reflecting. It is a pity that I do not have a single drop of poetic juice in my chest. Otherwise, facing the beautiful scenery in front of me, I could put my hands behind my back and chant for a while.</p>
<p>The twilight gradually covered up, but the crescent moon, less than half-full, hanging on the top of the evergreen tree gradually emitted its clear light. No matter how the god of night used its huge iron wings to cover up the darkness, it could not cover up the bright eyes of sister moon. Sprinkled on the branches, roofs, fields, rivers, mountains, streams, etc. is its universally loving silver light. She stands among the stars, like a benevolent empress, accepting the worship of all things covered by her.</p>
<p>I stood there silently, just standing there, the rushing thoughts could not escape beyond this free world. The fields where new rice has ripened seem to be a realm of pearls in the moonlight, and it also makes people associate it with coral reefs on the seabed. The red flowers of the kapok tree are like beacons for night travelers. The waterfall of the nearby mountain in the shadows is particularly spectacular in the moonlight. The fishing boats parked under the big trees on the river bank are radiating one or two points of light from their awnings, which echoes the shimmering fireflies on the water's edge. Autumn insects have sounded their first movement, and everything, everything is smiling humorously in the moonlight.</p>
<p>A faint, clear feeling grew up from my heart. The brain nerves that had been muddied by the sultry air and the children's noise during the day were completely dispersed and completely clear at this time. Such a beautiful dusk, I really don't want to run back into the low, humid, and mosquito-filled room.</p>
<h3>Northeast Fourth Company Commander</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 14: Difficult Marriage, Lingering Worries about the Future, Small Gathering with Friends, Bashful Remembrance of the Past</p>
<p>He lowered his head and walked straight forward when he suddenly heard someone shouting in front of him: Here he comes, here he comes! Isn't this exactly him coming? Zhao Ziqiang looked up and saw that it was Tian Qing and Huang Manying standing and laughing at the door of his house. Zhao Ziqiang smiled and said: How did you two meet here? Tian Qing smiled and said: Came to drink your wedding wine. Zhao Ziqiang smiled and said: Stop being naughty, it is not appropriate to joke here. As he spoke, he raised his foot to walk inside the house. Tian Qing stretched out both hands, blocking the door, and smiled: Don't go in, I have a few words to say to you. Let's go to the milk tea shop, eat a bowl of yuanxiao, okay? Zhao Ziqiang said: Wait for me, I have met... Tian Qing grabbed one of Zhao Ziqiang's arms and dragged him away without allowing him to explain. Before leaving, he threw a wink at Huang Manying, and she did not follow. Zhao Ziqiang walked along the road, complaining: You are really unreasonable. I haven't been home for many days and am eager to say a few words to my father, but you don't care and drag me away. Tian Qing smiled and said: I have already told the old man there, he said it doesn't matter, but don't make too much noise with the jokes. Zhao Ziqiang said: What? Do you want to joke with me? Tian Qing smiled and said: It's nothing, just talking. As he spoke, he had already arrived at the entrance of the milk tea shop. Zhao Ziqiang couldn't not go in, so he had to follow him in. When they got inside, the waiter asked them to sit in the loose seats in the general area. Tian Qing said: We have four people, so we have to occupy a private room. The waiter smiled and said: Okay! Please come to the private room. As he spoke, he rolled up the curtain, letting the two of them in. Zhao Ziqiang said: Where are there four people? Tian Qing smiled and said: There are also our lovers. Zhao Ziqiang said: Of course, Miss Huang is coming, who else? Tian Qing smiled and said: There is... No need to ask, they will come in a while. Zhao Ziqiang really couldn't think of what his plans were. He had no choice but to order cocoa from the waiter and drink it slowly. (176)</p>

<h3>Cooking and Nutrition of Tofu</h3>
<p>— Bing Yu</p>
<p>Tofu is my favorite food in my entire life. Whether the cooking method is simple or complex, it always has a special flavor. A simple way to eat it is to take a piece of soft tofu, add a few drops of sesame oil, a pinch of fine salt, mix well, and it becomes very delicious. In addition, you can mix it with Toona sinensis and sesame paste, or add some red fermented bean curd marinade, or use pickled vegetable marinade to cook it. These are all very simple and economical. If you cook it in a complex way, like the dozens of methods in Mr. Yuan Zicai's "Suiyuan Shidan," those methods are not suitable for ordinary families because they require a lot of ingredients and procedures, completely losing the original meaning of eating tofu. Now, I will talk about the economical cooking methods of tofu and its nutritional benefits:</p>
<p>1. Nutritional Benefits of Tofu: According to scholars' research and analysis, the nutritional components of tofu are: moisture 88.7%, protein 6.5%, fat 0.3%, carbohydrate 3.7%, calcium 0.5%, iron 0.02%, phosphorus 0.23%, salt 0.25%, calories 45. Vitamin B is the most abundant, and vitamins A and D are also present. Therefore, people who have beriberi or eye diseases should eat more tofu. If people with diabetes eat tofu every day, they can be cured naturally. Nowadays, well-known nutritionists all recognize tofu as an indispensable food. Other benefits include that eating tofu can detoxify alcohol, prevent poisoning from bacteria, animal meat, and fish meat. When stung by bees, applying tofu can neutralize the toxins and dissipate them outwards. If you use tofu to wash the fur of domestic animals such as dogs and cats, it can completely remove dirt and scars from the skin, and the fur color will also be very shiny. Also, drying tofu in the sun can be used as a substitute for facial cleansing powder. In the past, the beauty method of Fujianese women was to wipe their faces with tofu, so their complexion was very delicate. As for the method of selecting tofu, it is very simple. The best quality tofu should be white and tender, soft and slippery to the touch, and melt in the mouth. Hard and old tofu will have a bitter taste and is not easily</p>
<p>digested. However, old tofu and soft tofu each have different effects depending on the cooking method.</p>
<p>2. Economical Cooking Methods of Tofu: There are many ways to cook tofu. Now, what I am going to talk about is very economical and delicious. Moreover, eating it with this cooking method is more beneficial than eating delicacies. If you don't believe it, please try eating it for a month, and you will feel that your appetite is increased and all diseases are eliminated. (1) Stir-frying method: There are many ways to stir-fry, but often people do not get the method right, which not only makes it unpalatable but also loses the nutrients. Therefore, when stir-frying, one should pay full attention. The most beneficial stir-fried tofu dish is spinach stir-fried tofu. Spinach is rich in vitamins A and B. The stir-frying method is: first cut the tofu into small pieces, use a ladle of oil. When the oil is hot and smoking, put the tofu in and fry both sides until golden brown. Sprinkle a pinch of salt, then add a bowl of clear water, cover the pot, and let it boil. Then add the chopped spinach, boil again, add a little soy sauce, uncover the pot, and slowly remove from the pot. Generally, people with intestinal problems are very suitable to eat it. Another is garlic stir-fried tofu. Garlic has the effects of preventing diseases, disinfecting, strengthening the stomach, and removing toxins in medicine. People in northern China like to eat it the most, so their bodies are very strong. This cooking method is also very simple. First cut the tofu into small pieces, let it dry, and dry-fry it with a little oil for three minutes and set aside. Then put the sliced garlic into the pot and stir-fry until cooked, then mix in the stir-fried tofu, and sprinkle a little salt and soy sauce at the same time, a ladle of cooking wine, and dozens of dried shrimps (dried shrimps must be boiled in boiling water for one hour). Stir-fry for five minutes and remove from the pot. Other methods of stir-frying tofu with Chinese cabbage or rapeseed can still be cooked according to the spinach method. (2) Stewing method: The most important thing to pay attention to in the stewing method is that the stewing time should be long and the cooking time should be short. The tofu to be stewed should be old, and the tofu to be cooked should be soft. Old tofu will not open up if it is stewed for a short time (that is, the tofu becomes honeycomb-like after being stewed over low heat). Soft tofu will crumble into pieces if it is cooked for too long. The above cooking methods are simple, economical, and rich in nutrients, because turnips contain a lot of vitamins A and E and iron, and mushrooms contain vitamin D. People who are vegetarian usually rely on the nutritional power of tofu and green vegetables.</p>
