<p>日外部考慮設共同委會謀解决</p>
<p>據東報載稱、俄人侵入滿境暴行事件、形勢漸趨嚴重、有由局部題帶來國際重要性之可能、其原因如次、㈠蘇俄進行五年計劃、漠視農民之窮乏、致農村之疲敝、已達於極點、不堪飢餓之農民逃亡至滿洲境内者、爲數日有增加、蘇聯官憲因滿洲當局國境防備之單薄、故大胆將越境逃亡之俄人逮捕殺戮、㈡西比利亞地方農民土匪近年來漸有增多之勢、但滿洲事變以來、因蘇俄遠東軍之增加、國境地區國家保安警隊與赤色軍之壓力之漸次加重、致農民土匪亦陷於勢不得逞之狀態中、彼等因常期之積憤與食料之獲得故、遂採取過激化之行動、侵入滿洲境内、掠奪橫行、掠取航行於國境河川内之船舶、形成一種蘇俄革命之農村反抗之形勢、㈢滿洲事變以來、蘇俄之反滿反日氣勢、日趨激化、又因日本在北滿之軍事勝利「滿洲國」勢力之漸趨伸長、及最近之中東路問題、致使帝俄時代在北滿所占之優先地步、步步退却、蘇俄人民對此感受極大憤激、又受集中國境之軍隊之滿洲境内、對白系俄人及滿洲人民施行不法暴行、形成蘇俄赤色帝國主義之激化、由上述三點而觀、可知俄人在滿境之暴行、係因蘇聯内部不安、致使人民趨於過激、挺而走險、當局對之、已失去其統制能力也、（世界社）</p>

<p>法蘇聯歡與歐洲現勢實</p>
<p>歐洲大戰而後。蘭西旣壓倒其歷史上之唯一敵國丨德意志。遂制覇西歐。在政治上則提携中歐諸小國。運用國際聯盟。與英國成對立之勢。在經濟上則吸收現金。穩執歐洲金融界之牛耳。其所存現金。駕英國而上。僅次於北美合衆國一等。加以法國對海外發展。對國内新興事業。皆取審愼態度。其貿易不必如英國之憑藉海外市塲。故其所决定之國策。注意「安全保障。」經濟則力主防制外貨之侵入。以維護國内經濟之生長。而其外交政策上。前此所以有領袖攻擊蘇聯之說者。則以當歐戰告終之後。德國感於國際間之孤立。英國對德雖暗示好意。然仍不肯明爲之助。且「凡爾賽」體系諸國。莫不欲壓抑德國。課以一千二百五十億馬克之賠欵。其後楊格計劃。雖减去三分之二。然德國仍不能勝此重負。是以胡佛延期支付實行以後。歐洲金融危機。仍舊顯露。洛桑會議之結果。乃又不能不以三十億馬克歐洲復興資金之名。替換三百六十五億之楊洛計劃矣。</p>
<p>當此時也。德國海外殖民地旣已喪失。國内政局又極不安。外受各國勢力之抑制。内感經濟破滅之可危。其國際間惟一出路。衹有求助於凡爾賽體系。以外之蘇俄而已。法國與蘇俄。在經濟上旣有戰債關係又有思想上衝突。今復加以德俄間之結合。於是法國與蘇。遂儼然成爲假想之敵。然歷時未久。法蘇之間。又恢復親交。互不侵犯條約。宣告成立。即法國所領導之小國。如波蘭如羅馬尼亞。亦皆與蘇聯復相友善者。則又何故。在資本主義一般學者之解釋。則以爲蘇聯旣抛棄其赤色恐怖主義。不再積極進行其世界革命之煽動。此所以當世列强。願與之重行携手。但事實究竟何如。尙有待於更進一步之研究耳。</p>
<p>頃者法國前内閣總理赫理歐氏。游歷蘇聯。備受彼國之觀迎。似法蘇之間。匪特無所謂嫌怨。且又甚親密矣。蓋法蘇兩國。原無絶對之利益衝突。又非如對德有歷史上傳來之惡感。故事實上苟有需要。即可以言歸於好也。矧德國自希特勒秉政以來。於今半年。雖實際上未嘗積極推翻「凡爾賽和約。」但其愛國運動之狂熱。軍事建設之猛進。在當時不能不使法當局有所恐懼。第一恐懼德意志與蘇聯軍事聯盟之成立。以德國固有之科學素養。輔以蘇聯之天然富源及勤勞耐苦之國民性。其足以威脅法國之覇權。殊爲明顯。詎料德國社黨執政。即高標打倒共産黨之口號。法國危懼。無形撤消。且可得一反面仰　德國之良好機會。法蘇親交之基因。乃由此而定。第二恐懼德意恢復故交。蓋意大利與德國。其立國精神相同。而皆不滿於「凡爾賽」和約。確有聯合一氣以抗法之可能。不過德意之間。尙有矛盾。欲其眞誠合作。亦殊不易。且四强公約成立而後。法意間已得暫時之緩衝。重新劃分歐洲各國領土之議。亦暫擱置。則法國之憂懼。又减去其一矣。第三恐懼德奥結合。在外交上可以增加德國之聲援。在經濟上可形成中歐之經濟聯盟。此於法國之制覇。猶難免不有所威脅。在德奥兩國。非但不能合一。且將不免於衝突。法國正可利用時機。使德國愈陷於孤立之險境。此三者中於法國之作用最大收效最宏者。莫如對俄提携。蓋可運用另一勢力以制德也。總之法國之排俄也。爲穩定其歐洲覇權。今之聯蘇也。亦即自「安全保障」出發。而以獨覇歐洲爲依歸耳。</p>

<p>可見積弊之不易除</p>
<p>我國輪船、積習最深者、尤以買辦制爲最、其次爲茶房及管事、現招商局總經理劉鴻生、對於各輪不良制度、毅然次第改革、普安新銘、已廢除買辦制、新銘茶房頭舞幣、與糾衆抗命、亦經劉氏强制離船、今更進一步、而將不良管事更調、初以微小之事、今則釀成極大糾紛、或亦整頓航務者應歷之過程也、</p>
<p>管事溺職各輪船中、設有管事一職、專司船員伙食事宜、近來新江天輪全體船員、呈報劉總經理、以各船員火食、日益惡劣、照局内所發餐費、不應食此粗爄、顯係管事之溺職、應請更調、其他長江各輪船員、亦嘖有煩言、僉稱、管事不力、致使糜耗金錢、使船員受無形損失、劉接報告後、先派員密查、及證明事實、便實行更調各管事、</p>
<p>批准更調此事經劉呈報理事會、要求用理事會名義、批准更調各船管事、理事會以爲調一管事、似無庸由理事會批准、嗣知此事似小實大、故即照劉呈請、將新江天管事王聲皐、調充江大管事、以江新管事任棠生、調新江天、以江大方安全、調江新而江華張金生、與江裕范鑫標、則互相對調、</p>
<p>抗拒移交局令發布後、新江天王皐聲首先抗命、拒絶移交、致任棠生不能上輪接替、王聲皐更不到船、避不見面、因其一人梗命致使局令不行、各船悉爲阻住、近數日、新江天行駛、遂成無管事局面、惟劉對此事、勢在必行、以維尊嚴、而革積弊、今新江天輪、將停班修船、在此數日中、此問題當可解决、蓋王聲皐如再抗命、劉將施以嚴厲之　處置也、</p>
<p>海員反對王聲皐已將此事、報告海員工會籌備會、遂由該會致函劉鴻生、大致以船内管事、如果憑船員不滿意、局中即可自由更調進退、則以後在輪人員、失去職位之保障、祇須某船員不合意、便得任意斥革、海員工會、對於此事、表示不能同情、請劉總理迅將更調命令、尅日收回、仍令各該管事原職任事、茲聞劉對於此次更調各輪管事、認爲整頓船舶内部重要事務之一、如果彼輩抗令不遵、或引其他力量與局方對抗者、則局中爲厲行整頓起見、將呈請交部飭調、故此事糾紛、前途尙難逆料、</p>

<p>行禮如儀、由主席孔祥熙報告、略謂、今天是我中華慈幼恊會舉行半年大會的一天、陽光是那樣地睛朗、天氣是那樣地淸明、實在足以鼓舞我們的精神、抱着樂觀的態度、去進行各種有意義的有價値的工作、今天承蒙各位熱心同志、不辭辛勞撥冗惠臨來參加討論、促進本會之各種事宜、藉此以促成我國家進步、這實在是很可快樂的一件事、而且是我應該首先代表本會向諸位同志鄭重致謝的、中華慈幼恊會每經過了半年、總具有一番特别的氣象、因此在每次舉行半年大會的時候、我們也就不能不發生、種特殊的　想、在過去半年之中、本會曾領導全國、舉行第二屆兒童節、印送兒童節手册、及其他特種刋物約三萬份、舉辦盛大之慈幼舞會擴大慈幼宣傳、舉行兒童保障演講十五次、查辦虐待兒童案件四十九起、散發勸戒虐待兒童書萬份、收養無告兒童一百零六名、其中經委予安置者二十五名、向貧民家庭宣傳衛生常識、計二百二十九次、送愈病兒四千二百三十名、恊助各處嬰孩健康比賽及衛生運動舉辦託兒所性質之慈幼團共收容寄託嬰孩三十名、施以相當之敎養、除以上常規的發展外、尙有幾項特殊的發展、如㈠進行設立北平慈幼會、已至實現程、度、㈡呈請立法院　訂兒童法律、設立兒童法院、㈢發行現代父母月刋、提倡父母敎育、現已出版至一卷四期、訂戶極多、頗受社會人士之歡迎、㈣特派副總幹事陳鐵生、馳赴北平、辦理華北戰區救濟事宜、計聯絡機關團體五十餘處、服務災民婦孺達三十餘萬人、㈤慈幼團體擴充範圍、添聘敎員、分設幼兒部與幼稚部、將原來寄託嬰兒之名額、由三十名增至四十名皆是、㈥凡此各</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>種發展、一方面固由於本會同人之努力、而另一方面、却尤賴於社會一般人士之力表同情、予以熱烈的贊助、數年以來、因本會之繼續的不斷的宣傳、一般同胞亦都翻然覺悟、認　慈幼工作</p>
<p>之重要、在各方面與本會密切地合作、除此而外、現在中國　出版界、對於兒童讀物、亦都極其注重、力求完善、各種有價値的日報、亦都闢有專欄、討論關係兒童與父母的各種問題、而在上海市、由於市政府敎育局社會局的發起、又已正式成立兒童幸福委員會、籌謀全市兒童之幸福、上海晨報館在最近曾舉行嬰兒健康比賽會、家庭同樂會·家庭經濟座談會、又决定在本年雙十節舉行全國兒童之健美比賽、從此可知在現社會上知道注重兒童幸福的人、已經不止於我們這少數的人了、而努力提倡兒童幸福的、也已經</p>

<p>請政府指撥棉麥借欵一部</p>
<p>作爲學校基金及開辦等費</p>
<p>丨在圖書館年會中提出丨</p>
<p>中華圖書館協會第二次年會、已於上月二十八日起至三十一日止、在北平淸華大學舉行、京滬一帶會員杜定友、劉國鈞、錢存訓等、均已赴平參加、並建議請設中央圖書館學校一案、原文如下、</p>
<p>主文請協會建議行玫院、及敎育部指撥棉麥借欵一部、於首都設立中央圖書館專門學校案、</p>
<p>理由（一）棉麥借欵、政府有用於建設之宣言、考建設事業、實以提高人民智識、增加其生産能力爲最要、圖書館爲推廣並提高人民智識最有效力、而最經濟之機關、故請以棉麥借欵之一部、用作辦理圖書館專校之經費、（二）現在圖書館事業日漸發達、專門人材、不敷分配、而全國圖書館專門學校、祇有私立文華圖書館專門學校一所、且又偏於武昌、實感不便、故欲推廣圖書館事業、非多養成專門人才不可、（三）現在各省市縣多設有圖書館、而效果並未大著、雖大半爲經濟所限、但無適當之才、亦爲其主因之一、故欲增加圖書館效率、亦非添辦圖書館專門學校不可、（四）首都爲全國觀瞻所繫、政令所出、學府林立、漸爲全國文化中心、自當集中全國推動文化之力量、以求發展、而圖書館爲推動文化最重要之機關、若於首都設立圖書館專校最爲相宜、（五）我國建設事業、以恢復農村經濟、最爲要途、而農村建設、首重農民敎育、圖書館與農民敎育、實有密切之關係、故宜多養成圖書館專門人才、以便推廣農民圖書館、</p>

<p>院長張忠道表談話</p>
<p>上海法政學院最近之眞實狀况、及其本年度之改進計劃、昨該院院長張忠道發表談話如次、本學院創辦於民國十三年、原名上海法政大學、自民國十九年經敎育部立案、曁司法际特許設立以後、院董會及學校當局、對於院務之發展、著著進行、不遺餘力、迨至今日規模漸具、爲海上有名學府之一、綜計十年來、前後畢業於本學院</p>
<p>、不下午餘人、第一屆高等考試、第一二三數屆法官考試、本院畢業生之獲選者、每屆都有十人左右、至承審員甄拔試騐之獲選者、更指不勝屈、供職於國内司法界政界敎育界、及各地執行律師職務者甚多、卽以上海一隅百論、服務法院之推檢外、執律師業者、約近百人、是本院造就政法人才、對於國家社會之貢獻、亦不爲淺鮮也、</p>
<p>關於本院債務問題、外界多不明眞相、以致傳說紛歧、查本院債務之有根據者、僅有營造公司劉銀生墊欵一項、已於去年雙方和解於上海第二特區法院、計由本院償還劉銀生一萬九千八百兩、業於去年底先付七千元、其餘分作三年付淸</p>
<p>、每年六月底及十二月底各付六分之一、現第一期三千餘元、又經本院履行照付、此外雖有一二自稱債權人、向法院起訴、然皆證據不足、　係别有作用、本學院爲維護法益計、自難承認、至於設備方面、最重要者、莫過於圖書館、本院所儲書籍、自民十九以後、每年度添置新書、均在六七千元以上、加以王寵惠院董之捐贈、曁鄭院長由歐洲所購政法名著、連原有在内、綜計中西書籍、在二萬册以上、（雜誌訂本在外）以一獨立學院所庋藏之圖書、已不可謂少、現在除將學生所納圖書費、悉充購置新書之用外、尙擬别籌鉅欵、廣爲搜羅、以充實此智識之寳庫、</p>
<p>其次則爲校舍問題、本院原校舍、年來以學生人數過多、不敷容納、目地近街市、不適辦學、故另覓適當地址、建築新校舍、實屬刻不容緩、校</p>
<p>董會有鑒及此、業於本年春請托上海縣長嚴愼予氏、在北橋鎭地方、購到基地九十餘畝、已由院董會議决籌欵建築、並延聘李字侃建築師、担任設計建築事宜、現正在積極進行中、預計本</p>
<p>年度終了之時、新校舍可以落成、</p>
<p>再其次敎務方面、以往之敎員待遇、專任敎員、每月最高新額二百餘元、兼任敎員每小時薪額</p>
<p>在四元左中、但專任每週授課時間最多十小時、全年以十二個月給薪、較之其他私立大學、對於敎授之待遇、實有過之無不及、本學年對於敎員之待遇、更加提高、專任敎授之薪額、有增至三百元以上者、敎授薪金總數、佔全校支出總額百</p>
<p>分之六十强、一面又復致力於課程之改訂、參照高等文官考試課目、及國内外著名大學之課程編制、加以修訂、使所有課程、完全系統化、並注重本國敎材、灌輸實用智識、俾能養成實務人才、以適應社會之需要、</p>
<p>查上年度、本院投考學生、非常踴躍、計報名應考者八九百人、取錄約三百餘人、若非平日校譽、能得到社會上一般人士之信仰、曷克臻此、本學年第一次招考甫畢之際、忽奉部令停止招生、不知本學院實在情形者、或不無揣測之詞、致發</p>
<p>生其他誤解、其實此種有時間性之停止招生、不獨無傷本學院之前途、反而更足以堅本院當局者之决心、并促成全校師生七八百人之合作、想敎部方面、對於極願負責改進之學校、將來必能加以扶助也、</p>
<p>總之、本學院無論如何環境、决本初衷、努力不懈、在最短期内、務期精神上與物質上、得到平衡之進展、尙望各界及海内賢達、予以言論上或實質上之贊助、則敎育前途幸甚、</p>

<p>初賽王勝須藤結果直落三</p>
<p>昨次賽亦以直落三擊敗柯</p>
<p>昨日下午四時半中華網球塲上、有一幕重要之網球比賽、與賽者爲扶輪杯决賽中劇戰四盤始分勝負之王文正與柯拉沙、此番狹路再逢、爭奪公開網球高級單打複賽權、在王必須報上次失敗之恨、在柯則須保持其上次之勝威、故競爭愈見緊張劇烈、惟此賽外界知者殊鮮、故觀衆寥寥、結果王以光榮之直落三擊敗柯拉沙、入於複賽週中、且雪上次失敗恨焉、至於王對須藤之初賽、王亦以直落三勝、成績如下、</p>
<p>六丨丨四</p>

<p>第一盤競爭至劇烈、與形勢之變幻莫測、爲本季比賽中得未曾有、使寥寥無觀者提心吊膽、神經緊張、二人之對角長抽、銳利爽膽、堪嘆觀止、加以均能减少失誤、使比賽愈趨於合理化、王文正小心翼翼、以兩邊邊界爲標的、施以左右猛烈之射擊、造成五比二局之優越戰績、以爲可以穩取首盤、但事竟不大爲然、柯拉沙之奇銳突起、使王文正氣燄消滅、演成意料不及之局面、</p>
<h3 id="c205">顯顔色難分難解 <a href="#c205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>五比二局後、王發球局失去、成五比三、柯取發球局、成五比四猶以爲王文正不難以六比四勝、且下局爲王發球、勝利之希望固極濃厚、但王接連兩次發球、均爲雙失誤、○丨三十、局面不佳、爲三記出界、第四記又出界、王乃以光局失去、竟成五比五、柯發球先勝四十比十五（三丨一）王反能奪回是局、又以六比五佔先、得失之間、形勢相差不可以道里計、如上局能如此者、王早以六比四結束矣、誠令人不可思解矣、</p>

<p>六比五後、又爲王發球、而王又失光局（滑四）乃又成六比六、緊要關頭、王不能發狠乘機取勝、每輕易失之、此不能不謂之唯一弱點、下局反爲柯勝、王反以六比七落後、大有前功盡棄之槪、幸取得發球局、成十比七、柯又勝、王再以七比八落後、然柯亦未能乘機進取、王以滑四勝光局、成八比八、再取柯之發球局、以九比八又佔柯之前、柯亦取王之發球局、成九比九、以下兩局、形勢反趨平緩、而卒以十一比九勝之、幸與不幸、其間殊令人尋味、</p>

<p>第二盤前四局、各以發球局失去、二比二後、柯負第三次發球後、王突勝自己之發球局、以四比二佔先、希望乃又將成爲事實、柯勝第三局後、卒連失兩局、王又以六比一終、第三盤王先勝四局、柯奪回一局、王又以六比一終、是兩盤柯表演大爲减色、王勝來極易、複賽週中、王亦將遇舊對手鄭兆佳、</p>

The main force of the Red bandits in western Fujian in Liancheng retreated and actually fled to northern Fujian, causing tension in Yanping. Because the main force of the 19th Route Army recently gathered in western Fujian, Mao Weisheng, Qu Shounian, and Cai Tingkai went to Yan one after another, preparing for a joint general attack on Tingzhou with the Guangdong army. The bandits avoided strength and attacked weakness, disrupting northern Fujian. Deng went to command military affairs in northern Fujian. (31st dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) News from the National Society: The Red bandits in northern Fujian have been repelled by the 19th Route Army. The Japanese Consulate in Nanjing received a telegram from the Japanese Consulate in Fuzhou yesterday, stating that Yanping had not fallen. The American Consulate in Fuzhou has not received any adverse news in Nanjing and has not heard of any additional warships being sent to Fujian to protect overseas Chinese. This proves that the situation in northern Fujian must be very calm. All external rumors are not credible, etc. (31st dispatch)</p>
<p>Taipei: According to reports received by the Taiwan Naval Department, the reason for the fall of Yanping was that Liu He-ding's troops decided to move their important military equipment and munitions due to rumors that the Red Army was coming fiercely. The Communist Party sent plainclothes teams into Yanping, but Liu He-ding finally received orders to recover Yanping in the middle of the 28th. The Navy also sent warships to Yanping, and people's hearts gradually stabilized. Fuzhou has turned from danger to safety. (31st Chinese United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to the information from the Consul-General of Fuzhou, Moriya, to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, due to the communist army occupying Yanping, the Japanese government has dispatched two destroyers, the cruiser "Isuzu", to Fuzhou to protect Japanese residents. However, yesterday the Ministry of Foreign Affairs discussed countermeasures to prevent contingencies and decided on the following policy, that is, to telegraph Consul-General Moriya ㈠ to maintain close contact with the Navy and order the overseas Chinese to evacuate at an appropriate time and temporarily accommodate them on the ship.

The British Acting Ambassador to Japan, Mr. Snow, visited Vice Minister Shigemitsu of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 5 pm on the 30th to discuss countermeasures to deal with the active communist army in Fujian Province. As a result, the two agreed that Britain would also send warships to the scene to take joint action with Japan. American warships are currently stationed in Fuzhou. The British and Japanese authorities intend to negotiate with the United States to jointly defend against the Communist army. Snow immediately instructed the British Consul-General in Fuzhou to contact the Japanese side for action. (31st Japan United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs telegraphed the Consul-General of Fuzhou, Moriya, ordering him to contact the Navy closely when necessary to allow overseas Chinese to take refuge on warships, and to take the principle of in-situ protection to protect the lives and property of overseas Chinese. At the same time, he was to contact the consuls of the United Kingdom and the United States and cooperate when necessary. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs also reported that the previous rumor that Yanping had fallen was not true. Yanping had not fallen, and the 61st Division of the 19th Route Army would also be transferred to Yanping. The Communist army had withdrawn to the northwestern border, and northern Fujian had become safe. (31st Chinese United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The communist bandits who invaded Fujian Province are very rampant. The United Kingdom, France, Italy, and other countries have sent warships to protect their respective overseas Chinese. Therefore, Japan has also urgently dispatched 50 warships and two destroyers from the Magong Naval Port. However, the communist bandits are in high spirits, causing the Japanese Navy to prepare to dispatch warships from the Magong Fortress again.

The situation in Fuzhou has slightly stabilized because the government army has recovered Yanping, and the communist bandits are now retreating to the northeast. However, there are still battles in Shunchang. (31st Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to a telegram from Hankou, the eight Catholic priests in Yuanzhou are safe.

<p>(Tokyo) According to information received by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, although Yanping in Fujian Province was occupied by the Communist Army, it was recaptured by Liu He-ding's army on the 28th. Liu is now asking all parties to send reinforcements to help in the battle. A part of Cai Tingkai's army has departed for Yanping and Fuzhou, so Fuzhou seems to have gained a little stability.

<p>The Tragedy is Unprecedented in Sixty Years</p>
<p>(Jinan) Wan Binlai, the head of the German Catholic Church in Caozhou, besides handling water disasters, relief, and relief in Heze, set out on the 17th to personally inspect the causes of the disaster and the disaster situation at the breaches in Shitouzhuang, Erfenzhuang, and Kaocheng. After ten days, on the 27th, he went to Jinan with Sun Qingze, the director of the Heze Bureau, to meet Han and report on the disaster situation, offering suggestions for governing the Yellow River. Wan said that the area affected by the breach in Erfenzhuang was 80 li long and 50 li wide in Dongming, inundating more than 700 villages. The area affected by the breach in Heze was 70 li long and 60 li wide, inundating more than 900 villages. The tragedy was unprecedented in 60 years. The cause of the breach was due to Henan's weak river defenses. The Kaocheng breach split into two streams, which converged north and south of Caoxian to Nanyang Lake, with a width of 30 li. In the disaster area, each draught cattle only cost ten yuan, and it cost forty yuan for one person to cross the river by boat. The breach in Shitouzhuang took one-third of the mainstream. In the disaster area, many people were selling their daughters to make a living. Epidemics occurred, and deaths followed one another. Medicine is an urgent need. In his opinion, the best way to govern the Yellow River is to open more branch canals to transport water during floods and irrigate during droughts. At this time, work can be used as a means of relief. Wan brought moldy grain and rice from the disaster area and handed it over to He Siyuan to take</p>

<p>(Kaifeng) Liu Zhi's circular telegram reads: All newspaper offices are aware that in addition to the frequent years of war and disasters in Henan Province, the people are displaced and wandering throughout the province. In the spring and summer of this year, locusts were disastrous, droughts were rampant, the Zhang River broke its banks, and the Luo River overflowed. Requests for disaster relief came one after another. Just as we were worrying that the treasury was empty and lamenting with our heads in the sky, unexpectedly, in early August, the Yellow River rose sharply, reaching a height of 1 zhang and 6-7 chi higher than usual. According to reports from various counties, on the 3rd of this month, Hua County was flooded due to local bandits breaching the dike in Changyuan, causing the water to flow into Hua, inundating more than 400 villages and causing losses to Northern Cao County, where the water flowed into the county with great force, reaching a depth of about 1 zhang and causing huge losses. Other counties such as Wen County, Mengjin, Wuzhi, Fanshui Lanfeng, Kaocheng, Fengqiu, Guangwu, Chenliu, Zhongmu, Yuanwu, Zheng County, Jiyuan, Gong County, Lingbin, Qinyang, and Kaifeng have all suffered extremely heavy disasters due to the overflow of the Yellow River. Statistics show that more than 2,000 villages and towns have been flooded, with some entire villages being completely submerged and some county towns being reduced to ruins by the floods. Houses have turned into ruins, and the autumn harvest has been lost. The living cling to trees, waiting to be fed, while the dead have become water ghosts, with floating corpses everywhere. What could be more heartbreaking than this? As for the exact number of people who have died and the property losses, it is difficult to calculate suddenly. At present, this government is sending personnel to investigate the disaster situation in various places on the one hand, and releasing urgent relief on the other hand. However, the disaster area is too wide and the number of disaster victims is too large. At this time, accommodation and food for relief all require large sums of money. The provincial treasury is extremely short, which cannot make up the slightest. In the blink of an eye, autumn will pass and winter will come. The disaster victims will lack both clothing and food. How can they live? The hidden worries are very great. This is an unprecedented catastrophe for mankind. Without the combined efforts of the whole country and joint relief, it will not be possible to reverse the fate and eliminate the remaining disasters. Gentlemen, you have the pain of the people in your hearts and are admired by all. Seeing this tragic situation, you will surely be compassionate. I hope you will have the heart to relieve the hunger and drowning, and fulfill the wish to save the world and save people, pointing to the granary and donating military grain, opening your wallets and donating honestly, promoting kindness and planting blessings, reviving and restoring the withered, and your virtue will be passed on to future generations without end. I respectfully appeal to you, hoping that you will consider it. Residing in Henan, Special Envoy and Pacification Director and Henan Province Chairman Liu Zhi kowtows (30th) seal (30th dispatch)</p>

<p>The Righteous Army's Plan to Save the Country is Discovered</p>
<p>Shang Yunxiang and 15 Others Arrested</p>
<p>(Shenyang) Shang Yunxiang (27 years old), a lieutenant colonel staff officer of the National Salvation Volunteer Army, along with Major General Bao Fenglong (44 years old) and 15 others, secretly entered Manchuria from Beiping and established a secret headquarters in the Shenyang commercial district. They organized a conspiracy group to disrupt the security of the puppet state. On May 7th, they bombed the American consulate. On May 12th, they bombed the British consulate. On June 4th, they bombed and destroyed the tram tracks in front of the Shenyang Railway Station. On June 27th, they bombed the Opium Public Sales Bureau, but all attempts failed. On July 27th, they were reported by Major Kikuchi, the leader of the military police squad, and investigated. On the 19th of this month, they were escorted to the Panyang Police Station. The incident was only made public at 4 PM today. (31st Telecommunication)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) Shang Yunxiang and 15 others planned to disrupt the puppet state. The conspiracy has been discovered. In addition to the details in the previous telegram, there are other conspiracies as follows: 1) To instigate a mutiny in the newly formed puppet state troops and secretly organize an anti-Japanese volunteer army, with Han Fengri as a councilor of the Pacification Army and Bao Fenglong as a staff officer of the Nation-Building Army or the Pacification Army. Once the newly formed army was established, they would instigate a mutiny and secretly reorganize it into the National Salvation Volunteer Army. This did not materialize because the two armies were disbanded. 2) Yan Zhi recruited volunteers in Changtu County and recruited a thousand people, but they disbanded before reaching Shanhaiguan. 3) In early April, Bao Fenglong used Qinhuangdao as a base and bought a thousand bandits, intending to reorganize them into a volunteer army. 4) Their second method was to join powerful units such as the Liaoyang Provincial Garrison Army or the Jilin Army, and then plot a mutiny, but they were arrested before they could succeed. 5) Cai Yingtong, with the aim of swaying people's hearts, went to the opium public sales bureau inside and outside Fengtian on June 20th, saying that Japan occupied the three northeastern provinces and deceived the Manchurian people by opening public sales of opium mixed with poison, hoping to exterminate tens of millions of compatriots. He sent intimidating documents threatening to shut down the business to sway people's hearts. (31st Telecommunication)</p>

<p>(Harbin) Japanese and puppet troops, together with local police, launched a large-scale attack on the righteous army in the triangular area of Hulan, Harbin, and Ashihe on the 28th. The aim is to drive the righteous army to the Songhua River north of Harbin. Therefore, all river traffic was cut off yesterday. At the same time, gunboats and armed vessels patrolled the Songhua River to prevent the righteous army from crossing the river and escaping. The fighting in the past few days has been quite fierce, and the righteous army has suffered many casualties. At the same time, the police are strictly searching vehicles, pedestrians, and household registrations. Recently, several people have been arrested, which seems to be related to the kidnapping of the French youth, Caspo, on the 24th. Today, more than a hundred members of the righteous army attacked Mao'ershan Station. The fighting is still in progress. Today, the French, British, and Japanese consuls visited Tai Kehua (transliteration), the police chief of the puppet government, to discuss the activities of the righteous army and the protection of overseas Chinese.

<p>The Presence of the Russian Military Commissioner in Khabarovsk Attracts Attention from Japanese Military Authorities</p>
<p>Harbin News: The atmosphere along the Russian-Manchurian border has recently become extremely tense due to the concentration of Soviet troops and the incidents of Russians crossing the border and committing atrocities. According to investigations, the strengthening of Soviet Russian military strength along the border occurred simultaneously with the outbreak of the Manchurian Incident. Since last spring, the pace of its progress has also gradually increased. If we add the one division recently deployed to the western border, its total force consists of nine infantry divisions. Its main locations are Bauerjia, Durrie, Blagoveshchensk (i.e., Hailanpao), Khabarovsk (i.e., Boli), Kongrotaikao, Uladivo, and other places. In addition to the infantry divisions, there are also powerful mechanized corps, cavalry brigades, and aviation units. Furthermore, there are national security forces, non-regular troops of the communal farm corps, and gas factories in various places are actively preparing for chemical warfare. The equipment of the various units is all based on the principle of "the military comes first," and in terms of supplies, the military is also superior to the workers. The Soviet Union is constructing solid fortifications along the border, with particular emphasis on the areas along the Trans-Baikal and Ussuri railways, opposite Heihe, and near the confluence of the Songhua and Heilongjiang rivers. These fortifications are all built with concrete and are of a permanent nature. The construction work is done through forced labor, compelling farmers and others to engage in it. Furthermore, the Amur, Ussuri, and Trans-Baikal railways are transporting troops every day. The double-tracking of the Amur line is currently underway and is one-third completed. Furthermore, all employees on the Trans-Baikal line are active-duty soldiers of the railway corps. (World News Agency)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The Soviet Russian ambassador to Tokyo visited Japanese Vice Minister Shigemitsu Kui and stated that the Soviet Russian border defense forces have no intention of invading "Manchukuo" and that no special troops have been concentrated along the border. (31st Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>According to the Eastern News, it has been confirmed that Soviet Military People's Commissar (i.e., Army Chief of Staff) Voroshilov is currently staying in Khabarovsk (i.e., Boli). His deployment to the Far East is nominally to inspect the regular exercises along the Russian-Manchurian border, but he opposes the sale of the CER. The resignation of Karakhan was also due to the reaction against his tough diplomacy. At this critical juncture in Russo-Japanese relations, the Japanese authorities are paying close attention to his actions. (World News Agency)</p>
<p>According to a report in the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun on the 25th, the Soviet Russian authorities have recently been actively planning military actions in the Far East. On the 9th of last month, at the temporary military airfield at the Eastern Racecourse in Vladivostok, combat tactics were being trained. One of the military aircraft crashed at the airfield, but the Russian side kept the matter strictly secret, so the details are unknown. Currently, in addition to concentrating Red Army troops outside the Russian-"Manchurian" border, military aircraft are being concentrated in Vladivostok in order to ensure the security of the Far East. Among these military aircraft, the bombers have excellent performance capabilities, meaning they could fly long distances back and forth between Vladivostok and Tokyo. Therefore, the Japanese authorities are paying extraordinary attention to the Soviet Russian military actions.</p>
<h3 id="e34">The Situation of Disputes on the Russian-Manchurian Border is Gradually Becoming Serious <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese Foreign Ministry is Considering Establishing a Joint Committee to Seek a Solution</p>
<p>According to a report in the Eastern News, the situation of the incidents of Russians invading Manchurian territory and committing atrocities is gradually becoming serious and may bring international importance to the local issue. The reasons are as follows: 1) The Soviet Union is carrying out its Five-Year Plan, disregarding the poverty of the peasants, leading to extreme exhaustion in the countryside. The number of hungry peasants fleeing into Manchurian territory is increasing daily. Soviet officials, taking advantage of the weakness of the Manchurian authorities' border defenses, boldly arrest and kill Russians who cross the border to flee. 2) The number of peasant bandits in the Siberian region has gradually increased in recent years, but since the Manchurian Incident, due to the increase in the Soviet Russian Far East Army, the pressure from the national security police and the Red Army in the border area has gradually increased, causing the peasant bandits to be in a state of helplessness. Because of long-term resentment and the need to obtain food, they have adopted radical actions, invading Manchurian territory, looting, and seizing ships sailing in the border rivers, forming a kind of rural resistance to the Soviet Russian revolution. 3) Since the Manchurian Incident, the anti-Manchurian and anti-Japanese sentiments in Soviet Russia have intensified daily. Furthermore, due to Japan's military victory in northern Manchuria, the gradual expansion of the "Manchukuo" forces, and the recent CER issue, the preferential positions occupied by Imperial Russia in northern Manchuria are gradually receding. The Soviet Russian people feel great anger about this. Furthermore, the troops concentrated on the border with Manchuria commit illegal atrocities against White Russian and Manchurian people, forming an intensification of Soviet Russian red imperialism. From the above three points, it can be seen that the atrocities of the Russians in Manchuria are due to internal unrest in the Soviet Union, causing the people to become radical and take risks. The authorities have lost their ability to control them. (World News Agency)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the resolution of the frequent inauspicious incidents in the northern Manchurian border area recently, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has considered establishing a joint committee between Japan, Russia, and Manchuria, and has obtained the preliminary consent of both Russia and "Manchukuo." After the CER transfer negotiations currently underway in Tokyo are completed, the three-nation negotiations will continue. It has been internally decided to present concrete proposals to the representatives of the two countries at an appropriate time. The task of the committee is to prevent various disputes in the border area and other emergency solutions. At the same time, determining the source of the Russian-"Manchurian" border disputes is also an important task. There are those who advocate establishing a border demarcation committee based on Article 7 of the Sino-Russian Agreement and Article 3 of the Feng-Russian Agreement. This matter also requires inquiring about the intentions of the Manchurian side and taking appropriate action within the next few days. (31st Telecommunication)</p>

<p>(Moscow) On the 17th anniversary of the outbreak of World War I, the Soviet press issued serious warnings about the threat of a new imperialist war. At the same time, the newspapers cited the Soviet Union's continued struggle to maintain peace. The Soviet government gazette "Izvestia" stated, "At present, even the spokespersons of the capitalist world admit and openly declare this matter, that the world is now closer to war than at any other time." After stating the growth of imperialist contradictions and the inability of the powers to escape the current crisis, the newspaper said that imperialism is heading towards a new world war. The newspaper further said, "The two most reckless groups of imperialists, Germany and Japan, openly declare that they are preparing for war against the Soviet Union, hoping that their enemies who hate socialism and the Soviet Union as much as they do will come out in support. The Soviet government is pursuing its peace policy in the face of this trend, but at the same time, it must prepare itself fully armed to deflect the imperialists' violent actions against the Soviet Union. When it is invaded, it must be prepared to counterattack immediately and destroy the desire of the representatives of increasingly decaying capitalism to revive themselves in the blood of Russian workers and collective farmers." The Supervisory Newspaper compared the imperialists' preparations for war with the Soviet Union's struggle to maintain peace. The newspaper said, "The Soviet Union's policy is a peace policy because the Soviet government's goal is to protect the interests of the working people. The Soviet Union does not need war, it does not need foreign territory or other people's property to seek its own development." The newspaper further denied that the Soviet Union's advocacy of peace was due to its weakness and cited Stalin's statement that the Five-Year Plan has transformed the Soviet Union from a weak and poorly defended country into a country with strong defense capabilities, capable of coping with any emergency and capable of mobilizing on a large scale to manufacture all kinds of new defense weapons. The newspaper concluded, "Some German hyper-vigilant fascists, Japanese imperialist adventurers, and British conservatives may think otherwise, but they will feel they are completely wrong. The Soviet Union has repeatedly proven that it is indeed pursuing a pure peace policy, but when necessary, the Soviet Union will eliminate any enemy's attack with ease." (August 1st TASS News)</p>

<p>(Hangzhou) Ji Gengyang, a prosecutor at the Zhejiang High Court, has charged Tao Sijin and Xu Qinwen with jointly endangering the Republic of China.

After returning to school, she reorganized the Mutual Aid Society. Tao Sijin also admitted to joining the "Eighteen Arts Society" and going to Shanghai during the summer vacation of the 19th year, where she met classmate Luo Yankan and discussed communist party matters. The evidence proves that Tao is a member of the Communist Party and is engaging in treasonous propaganda in writing. Liu is a confirmed member of the Communist Party, as Xu knew.

<p>A National General Strike Begins</p>
<p>Demands the Current President's Resignation</p>
<p>Guayaquil, Ecuador, 30th (National News Agency) With the Cuban revolution successfully concluded, the revolutionary party in Ecuador has followed suit. Its labor union has ordered a general strike and seems to have the support of the majority in Congress, so Congress has also adjourned for three days to support the workers' demands for the president's resignation. After the workers went on strike, no incidents have occurred so far. The government has deployed troops to patrol the streets, but it is questionable whether the troops are loyal to the current government. The president has ordered the workers to return to work tomorrow, otherwise martial law will be implemented. The strike began in Quito and quickly spread everywhere, appearing to be well-organized. The president claims that he will remain in the capital, but also admits that the strike is the beginning of a revolution, as the strikers are demanding the president's resignation, citing his failure to organize the economy and political corruption as reasons, and claiming that they will not return to work until the president resigns. President Mena is a member of the Liberal Party, who claimed to be elected last October. The election was controversial at the time because Mena had the support of the military and was able to take the seat, excluding Ponafa西, who received the most votes, from the country. Ponafa西 has not publicly participated in the matter, but it is believed that he is the true leader behind the scenes. Ecuador has two major political parties, one is the Liberal Party and the other is the Conservative Party. Their policies are similar, both advocating economic and social reform. However, in terms of religion, the Conservative Party is more tolerant of Catholicism.</p>

The leaders of the Republican Army have protested to the government, which is enough to indicate the beginning of the war between the Republican Party and the Fannlera government.

When Hitler arrived here tonight, the people gave him the warmest welcome to redeem their previous transgressions.

<p>Brussels, Belgium is now following in France's footsteps and has decided to implement the defense of its eastern border to prevent aggression. According to De Vinze, although this plan is in progress, the world's poor economic situation has also affected Belgium's finances, so the progress of this work is often hindered. The natural barriers of the Black F Plain and the new-style fortresses in Liege and Namur will soon be completed. At the same time, the new fortress being built in Iboneser will also be completed. The Belgian Prime Minister is now asking Congress to approve the funding for this plan, and at the same time, within the scope of Belgium's financial situation, implement the national defense plan (Reuters). Rome, the European arms movement, the defense preparations made by France and Belgium are one example. Today it has taken another step forward, because Austrian Chancellor Dr. Dolfuss' special envoys Fangstai Hengbao and Li Qianer arrived in Vienna today.

<p>(New York) Davis, chairman of the US delegation to the Disarmament Conference, sailed to Europe today on the "Washington" liner. Before the ship set sail, President Roosevelt suddenly called Davis back by telephone and gave him final instructions, stating that the Disarmament Conference will reconvene in Geneva on September 16. He earnestly hoped that European countries could find a way to achieve disarmament and peace. Davis will stay in London for eight days to contact British cabinet members, and then travel from England to Paris to meet with French authorities before attending the Disarmament Conference. When Davis was about to set sail, he told reporters, "I cannot predict the results of the preliminary talks in London and Paris, but I believe that if all countries can cooperate sincerely, they will be able to reach a compromise to maintain world peace. President Roosevelt believes that the disarmament issue is of great importance, and he is very clear about its content. He will surely provide many instructions and assistance to this matter. I hope that when I said goodbye to the President, I saw that his concern for peace was greater than ever before." When Davis talked about the war debt issue, he clearly declared that this matter was not within his duties, so he would not discuss it.

<p>The White House Declares No Connection with Norman's Visit to the US</p>
<p>Is This a Preliminary Step Towards Stable Exchange Rates?</p>
<p>Or a Prelude to Inflationary Currency?</p>
<p>Civilian Discussions Abound</p>
<p>Hyde Park, President Roosevelt declared that although the ban on gold exports has been slightly relaxed, it has no connection to his meeting with the Governor of the Bank of England, Norman, the day before. People in the banking industry believe that all transactions of gold produced by gold mines must be introduced by the Federal Reserve Bank.</p>
<p>(30th Havas)</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, the country is discussing whether the US President's order yesterday allowing the export of newly mined gold is a prelude to the devaluation of the currency or a preliminary step towards stable exchange rates. The government only issued a statement from the President's private residence in Hyde Park, saying that this order will help solve unemployment, maintain the metallurgical industry, and make it easier for the government to control those who hoard gold. It did not mention devaluation or stability. As for public discussions, those who argue that this order is a prelude to inflationary currency are mostly people who advocate inflation. Most economists believe that this order will not make the gold dollar more stable than before, and will curb the trend of foreign markets speculating wildly on the gold dollar. However, there are still indications that the country wants to rely mainly on industrial recovery to stabilize the gold dollar. According to news from the Industrial Recovery Administration, the national weekly wage bill has increased by 30 million yuan compared to before. Since March, excluding agricultural re-employment of tenant farmers, approximately 2 million unemployed workers have been re-employed. However, the National Recovery Administration cannot say that the recovery program has gained the momentum it needs until 6 million unemployed people have new jobs. (30th National News Agency)</p>
<p>(New York) People in Wall Street said today that US exporters and other merchants who exchanged all their gold dollars for foreign currency when the gold standard was abandoned must now exchange them for gold dollars in the foreign market in order to ship them back to the country. According to Washington news, US officials also hold the same view, predicting that the price of the gold dollar will rise moderately. When the newly mined gold is shipped abroad, the number of foreign currencies exchanged for gold dollars will inevitably increase. Furthermore, the funds obtained by the Ministry of Finance from selling gold abroad must also be exchanged for gold dollars, which will further increase the foreign demand for gold dollars. It is recently heard that there has been a significant increase in funds returning from Europe. In April, when people generally believed that foreign currencies were more stable, they sent huge amounts of money abroad, causing domestic financial exhaustion and forcing the Federal Reserve Bank to purchase public bonds to expand credit. Now, with the domestic industry showing renewed vitality, if these people want to fully participate in the industrial recovery, they must spend this money domestically and therefore exchange it for gold dollars and ship it back. The permission to export gold has accelerated the trend of exchanging foreign currency for gold dollars. Although economists and merchants have different opinions on the impact of the order allowing the export of newly produced gold, a well-known banker has told its customers that exporting gold will increase foreign prices. Once the increase in domestic prices in the United States gains universal trust, the gold dollar will automatically stabilize. Other bankers have also said that there are few foreign free gold trading markets. If gold standard countries can obtain the gold they need for their currencies, then non-gold standard countries will not be forced to implement such strict restrictions.

<p>Automobile Tycoon Has Not Yet Accepted</p>
<p>President Prepares to Take Action</p>
<p>Hyde Park, Roosevelt has instructed General Johnson, the administrator of the Recovery Act, to submit a report on Ford's failure to accept the regulations for the automotive industry. Although President Luo did not issue a threatening statement, this move can be seen as an indication that President Luo is preparing to take action. The automobile tycoon is currently spending the summer somewhere in Michigan. Washington has not yet received news from him. At the same time, the authorities are actively promoting the mass movement to re-employ unemployed workers, creating several million yuan in new purchasing power under the Blue Eagle certificate. General Johnson personally gave a speech to the public in Boston today to end the movement for all national business storefronts to display the Blue Eagle cooperation certificate, saying that the number of unemployed workers who have now been re-employed and become self-sufficient citizens has reached 2 million, and the weekly wage bill has increased by at least 30 million yuan. However, the National Recovery Administration cannot say that the recovery program has gained the momentum it needs until 6 million unemployed people have new jobs. (30th Reuters)</p>

<p>Tokyo Accepts Russian Proposal</p>
<p>Advocates Concluding a Reciprocal Agreement First</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Soviet Union has proposed to the Japanese government to open negotiations on a commercial treaty between the two countries. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has ordered Japanese Ambassador to Moscow Ota to accept it. It is heard that the Japanese government believes that the 1925 Beijing Treaty is sufficient to apply to the commercial relations between the two countries. The purpose of the agreement now needed is to promote trade between the two countries. At present, trade between the two countries is almost one-way, because Japan purchased 26 million yuan worth of goods from the Soviet Union last year, while the Soviet Union purchased only 4 million yuan worth of goods from Japan. Therefore, the Japanese authorities intend to balance the amount of trade between the two countries and implement a long-term credit system so that both parties can benefit. (31st Reuters)</p>

<p>Rice Prices Fall; Farmers Complain</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The price of rice, the center of the rural economy, continues to fall, and the plight of farmers has intensified. The government is very concerned because the rice problem will become a major problem in rural society. The Rice Grain Control Law will be implemented on October 1. According to this regulation, the minimum price of rice is 23 yuan per koku. However, farmers advocate 25 yuan. In addition, the farmers' associations in Ishikawa, Toyama, Niigata, and other prefectures outside the scope of the implementation of this law have petitioned the government to purchase large quantities of rice and consider the issue of rice production restrictions. The rice price problem will become more serious in the future. (31st Japan United Press)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Since the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry announced the actual amount of rice reserves, rice prices have fallen and do not seem to be recovering. Because more than 10 million koku of Japanese rice are left this year, which is twice the normal amount of 5 million koku left over. The Imperial Farmers Association is very worried about peasant uprisings during the autumn harvest. It has decided to convene a national conference in Tokyo on September 14, gathering 3,000 representatives from various regions to discuss countermeasures. The main issues to be submitted to the conference are as follows: 1. Demand that the government earnestly maintain rice prices; 2. Reduce the various burdens on farmers so that the burdens on farmers are equal to those on merchants and industrialists; 3. Change the tax payment period in rural areas to prevent rice prices from falling; 4. Home-use agricultural processed products should not be subject to consumption tax; 5. Reduce or exempt excessive taxes, etc. (31st China United Press)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) There are those in the government and the upper house who agree with the Seiyukai's rice price increase theory. However, the agricultural and forestry authorities observe the following: If they want to rapidly increase rice prices, the government will have to buy a considerable amount of rice. If they buy it immediately as the Seiyukai advocates, it is a reckless argument that does not understand the Rice Grain Law and the Rice Grain Control Law that will be implemented from November 1. With the implementation of the control law, the price of rice will naturally rise from the minimum price, and the September market price of the November futures will inevitably soar. If so, the rice price increase theory will naturally lose its effect. (31st Dentong News Agency)</p>

<p>The Franco-Soviet Union and the Reality of the European Situation</p>
<p>After the European War, France overwhelmed its only historical enemy, Germany, and thus dominated Western Europe. Politically, it supported the small countries of Central Europe and used the League of Nations to form an opposition force with Britain. Economically, it absorbed cash and steadily held the reins of the European financial world. Its cash reserves surpassed those of Britain, second only to the United States of America. In addition, France took a cautious attitude towards overseas development and emerging domestic industries. Its trade did not have to rely on overseas markets like Britain, so its national policies focused on "security." Economically, it advocated preventing the invasion of foreign goods to maintain the growth of the domestic economy. In its foreign policy, the reason why there was previously talk of a leader attacking the Soviet Union was that after the end of the European War, Germany felt isolated internationally. Although Britain hinted at goodwill towards Germany, it was still unwilling to provide clear assistance. Moreover, the countries of the "Versailles" system all wanted to suppress Germany and impose reparations of 125 billion marks. Later, although the Young Plan reduced it by two-thirds, Germany still could not bear this heavy burden. Therefore, after the implementation of the Hoover Moratorium, the European financial crisis still emerged. The result of the Lausanne Conference was that it could not but replace the 36.5 billion Yang-Lou Plan with 3 billion marks for European recovery funds.</p>
<p>At this time, Germany had already lost its overseas colonies, and its domestic political situation was extremely unstable. It was suppressed by the forces of various countries from the outside and felt the danger of economic collapse from the inside. Its only international way out was to seek help from the Soviet Union, outside of the Versailles system. France and the Soviet Union had war debt relations economically and ideological conflicts. Now, with the combination between Germany and Russia, France and the Soviet Union seemed to become imagined enemies. However, after a short period of time, France and the Soviet Union restored friendly relations, and the non-aggression pact was announced. Even the small countries led by France, such as Poland and Romania, became friendly with the Soviet Union again. Why is this? In the explanation of general scholars of capitalism, it is believed that the Soviet Union has abandoned its red terrorism and no longer actively conducts its incitement of world revolution. This is why the great powers of the world are willing to rejoin hands with it. However, what is the truth of the matter? It remains to be further studied.</p>
<p>Recently, former French Prime Minister Herriot toured the Soviet Union and was warmly welcomed by that country. It seems that there is not only no resentment between France and the Soviet Union, but also a great deal of intimacy. France and the Soviet Union originally had no absolute conflict of interest, and they did not have the historical animosity towards Germany. If there is a need in fact, they can reconcile. Moreover, since Hitler came to power in Germany, although he has not actually actively overthrown the "Treaty of Versailles," his patriotic movement is fanatical and his military construction is advancing rapidly, which could not but cause fear to the French authorities at the time. The first fear was the establishment of a military alliance between Germany and the Soviet Union. Germany's inherent scientific literacy, supplemented by the Soviet Union's natural resources and hard-working national character, would be enough to threaten France's hegemony. It was unexpected that the German Socialist Party would take power and immediately put up the slogan of overthrowing the Communist Party. France's fear was invisibly eliminated, and it could get a good opportunity to check Germany from the opposite side. The gene for Franco-Soviet friendship was thus determined. The second fear was the restoration of old friendship between Germany and Italy. Italy and Germany have the same national spirit and are dissatisfied with the "Treaty of Versailles." There is indeed the possibility of uniting to resist France. However, there are still contradictions between Germany and Italy, and it is not easy to achieve sincere cooperation. Moreover, after the establishment of the Four-Power Pact, the relations between France and Italy have been temporarily eased, and the discussion on re-dividing the territories of European countries has also been temporarily shelved. Therefore, France's worries have been reduced by one. The third fear was the combination of Germany and Austria. In diplomacy, it can increase Germany's support. Economically, it can form an economic alliance in Central Europe. This will inevitably threaten France's hegemony. Not only can Germany and Austria not unite, but they will inevitably clash. France can take advantage of the opportunity to make Germany more isolated. Among these three, the one that has the greatest effect and the most significant results for France is cooperation with Russia. It can use another force to contain Germany. In short, France's rejection of Russia was to stabilize its European hegemony. Its current alliance with the Soviet Union also starts from "security" and is based on dominating Europe.</p>

However, some details in the reports contain inaccuracies. The overflow from Lanfeng was due to the diversion of the Yellow River. The affected areas, including Heze and other counties in our hometown, extend southeast from Lanfeng and Minquan towards Xuzhou. This situation seems related to the breaches at Dongming Erfenzhuang and other locations in Hebei Province, and may not be the same incident as the Lanfeng overflow. As fellow villagers residing in Kaifeng, we have more accurate information and share your concern for our homeland. We request that you clarify the situation of the rivers to correct any misperceptions caused by distant reports. If there are any omissions, please conduct a more thorough investigation to uncover the truth." Shandong Sojourners Association in Kaifeng.</p>

<p>Absolutely No Troops Sent to Breach Lanfeng Embankment</p>
<p>Also Telegraphs Shandong and Henan to Inquire if There Are Malicious Agitators. Hua County Flood Losses Exceed Thirty Million</p>
<p>Kaifeng dispatch: Since the beginning of the month when Wen County first suffered from the Yellow River floods, followed by the emergency in Heigang and the breach at Lanfeng, nearly three weeks have passed. Kaifeng has been almost entirely surrounded by the sounds of the Yellow River. Recently, the dangerous conditions have stabilized somewhat, and people are feeling more at ease. However, on August 26th, the provincial government suddenly released a telegram from Gansu reporting a rise of four meters in the water level, causing the relaxed atmosphere to become tense again. People greet each other by inquiring about the rise and fall of the water, creating an atmosphere of fear.</p>
<p>Xu Xinwu, a member of the Yellow River Conservancy Committee, arrived in Kaifeng on the afternoon of the 28th, accompanied by engineer Cai Lianggong and deputy engineer Qi Hongyou. According to Xu, their tasks in the lower reaches can be divided into four categories: (A) sealing breaches, (B) adjusting and repairing dikes, (C) reinforcing embankments, and (D) assisting. The flood control efforts in the lower reaches of the Yellow River are divided into three zones. The first zone is Lanfeng, where the engineering office is located, with Chen Ruzhen, director of the Henan River Affairs Bureau, as the director and Cai Lianggong as the engineer. The second zone is Changyuan, and the third zone is Heze. Materials and labor will be sourced locally, with purchases from other areas if necessary. Labor will be recruited from the affected provinces, with wages provided by the office. They have sufficient funds for the work.</p>
<p>The representatives from eighteen counties in western Shandong, including Han Jifu, recently issued a telegram reporting to the central government that Liu Zhi sent troops to breach the Lanfeng embankment, flooding western Shandong. Liu was furious upon reading this report. He immediately telegraphed Han Fuju, asking if there were any malicious agitators, and also sent a telegram to the central government, requesting an immediate investigation. The provincial Kuomintang headquarters also responded to Liu's telegram, sending telegrams to Chairman Lin, President Wang, President Yu, President Sun, President Ju, the Yellow River Conservancy Committee, and Chiang Kai-shek at Kuling, requesting a thorough and strict investigation.</p>
<p>The flood damage in Hua County is extremely severe. The provincial disaster relief committee sent a telegram yesterday to the National Government, Commander-in-Chief Chiang, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Interior, the Disaster Relief Committee, and various charitable organizations in the north and south, stating: "According to a telegram from the Hua County Flood Relief Association, Chairman Zhang Jun of the Henan Provincial Disaster Relief Committee, the Yellow River breach has caused devastating floods, inundating Hua County. The county government and various organizations have already reported this by telegram. We are now providing a detailed account of the actual situation based on our investigation: On August 3rd,姬兆豐 Ji Zhaofeng, a bandit leader from Changyuan County, and Zhai Xuewen, a squad leader, successively breached the west bank of the Yellow River, flooding over 600 villages in Hua County. Over 400 villages have been completely submerged. The water covers over 5,000 square li and is 3 to over 10 feet deep. The loss of autumn crops is estimated at 1,500 yuan per square li, totaling over 8 million yuan. Over 450,000 houses have collapsed, estimated at 30 yuan each, totaling over 13 million yuan. Approximately 15,000 livestock have drowned, estimated at 50 yuan each, totaling over 750,000 yuan. The loss of property, such as stored grain, clothing, and miscellaneous items, is estimated at over 10 million yuan. The total loss is over 31 million yuan. Hua County is a poor and barren area with no boats prepared for such an event. People were drowning while still holding their children, or the elderly and young were carrying each other. Corpses are floating everywhere, creating a scene of extreme tragedy. Those who survived by climbing trees or rooftops were exposed to the sun and rain, suffering from hunger and cold, crying for help with no response, voices hoarse, and dying every day. It is unbearable to witness. Our fellow countrymen are almost entirely destitute. Although the local government and various charities have donated funds, and Chairman Liu has sent Director Wan with 2,000 yuan for relief, it is like a drop in the ocean. The disaster victims are struggling to survive, let alone pay taxes. We implore you to provide urgent relief and tax exemptions to save the people and show compassion for their lives. We eagerly await your response." (August 29th)</p>
<h3 id="e91">River Breaches in Southwest Shandong <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>The Zhu River and Wanfu River Are Full</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: In the southwestern part of this province, the Zhu River, Wanfu River, Zhao River, and Bali River have all experienced significant water level increases due to the Yellow River breach, causing the Yellow River water to flow into these rivers. The water level in the Zhu River and Wanfu River is now level with the banks, posing an imminent danger. The Zhao River and Bali River have both breached, resulting in flooding. The Department of Construction received a telegram yesterday from Zhang Shixie, director of the Yanzhou-Caozhou Railway Bureau, reporting that the Zhao River has breached in Jiaxiang. The department also received a telegram from Huang Baogan, a technician, from Chengwu, stating that the Bali River has breached upstream in Chengwu. The details are as follows: (1) Huang Baogan's telegram states: "Upon investigation, the Bali River has breached upstream in the Gaodingji southwest and Nanguan Beibei areas of Chengwu, flowing into the Danxian area between the Ba River and Le River. The water from the Ba River and Le River overflows into the Jinxiang area via the north bank of the Lecheng River. Last year, when Chengwu was dredging the upper reaches of the Bali River, residents opposed the project in the Nanguan Beibei section, preventing its completion. As a result, the river overflows during heavy rains. Although efforts have been made to fill the gaps in the unfinished section after the Ba River and Le River flooded in Danxian, the dikes in the sections where work has not yet begun are too low and have all overflowed. We have already reported this in a telegram. Once the Ba River and Le River projects are completed, Chengwu will repair the upper reaches, ensuring that the two rivers are protected from flooding forever." (2) Zhang Shixie's telegram states: "According to reports from the Jiaxiang stationmaster, the Zhao River has breached, causing flooding. The east, west, and south city gates are all flooded, and the roads west of the city are completely submerged. According to reports from the Jinxiang stationmaster, the water level in the Changtan River has risen by two feet and continues to rise. I respectfully report this via telegram."</p>
<p>The Department of Construction has dispatched special investigators to various areas to understand the extent of the flooding, the source and path of the water, the elevation of the land, and the accumulation of water. This is purely an engineering investigation to serve as the basis for future water management and river dredging. The investigators and their assigned areas are as follows: (1) Li Zhongxuan is assigned to Cao County, Heze, Dan County, and Jinxiang. (2) Li Xiangzhen is responsible for Pu County, Fan County, Yanggu, and part of Shou County. (3) Li Runfang is responsible for Dongping, Dong'a, Pingyin, and part of Shou County. All of these individuals have already departed. (August 30th)</p>

<h3 id="e93">Guangdong Province Plans Jiangqin Railway Construction <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>From Jiangmen to Qinzhou, Over Nine Hundred Li in Length</p>
<p>Costing Over Seventy Million, Completion in Four Years</p>
<p>Guangzhou dispatch: To improve transportation among the southwestern provinces, plans were previously made to build railways in Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Sichuan. However, due to the massive scale of the project and the difficulty in raising funds, construction could not begin immediately. Recently, the authorities in Guangdong and Guangxi proposed building the Qinyong Railway first, connecting Qinzhou in the southern part of Guangdong Province directly to Nanning in Guangxi Province. However, Qinzhou is located in the southern part of Guangdong Province, and access to Qinzhou from the provincial capital relies on ships, as land routes are not yet connected, making transportation inconvenient. Recently, the Guangdong Department of Construction, to improve transportation between Guangzhou and the southern part of the province, decided to first build the Jiangqin Railway, connecting key areas in the southern part of the province. This would not only promote commerce and industry in the southern part of the province, but also connect with the future Qinyong Railway. If both railways are completed, transportation in both Guangdong and Guangxi would greatly benefit. The Jiangqin Railway construction plan and funding plan have been drafted by the Department of Construction. The route starts from Jiangmen (in Xinhui County) and runs 30 li from Jiangmen to Gongyi Pier, 100 li from Gongyi to Kaiping County, 130 li from Kaiping to Enping County, approximately 113 li from Enping to Yangchun, approximately 69 li from Yangchun to Huangtang, 61 li from Huangtang to Xinyi County, approximately 21 li from Xinyi to Shatou, approximately 178 li from Shatou to Nantang, approximately 66 li from Nantang to Shichong, 44 li from Shichong to Zhanghuang, approximately 91 li from Zhanghuang to Bailao, and approximately 91 li from Bailao to Qinzhou. The entire route from Jiangmen to Gongyi, passing through Kaiping, Enping, Chun, Xinyi, Baida, and Qinzhou, is 903 li long. The funding for the railway construction will come from annual allocations from the provincial treasury and the establishment of a railway construction committee to oversee the project and be responsible for raising funds. It is planned to be completed within four years. The first year will involve surveying and mapping, costing approximately 5.86 million yuan. The second year will involve building the roadbed, costing approximately 10.83 million yuan. The third year will involve building bridges and culverts, costing approximately 47.4 million yuan. The fourth year will involve laying tracks and building stations and car factories, costing approximately 47.4 million yuan. The total cost is estimated to be over 76.7 million yuan.

<p>Qizishan in Suzhou is a famous scenic spot in Wu County. Recently, it has been a popular destination for pilgrims. Yesterday morning (31st), hikers discovered the corpse of a man in elaborate clothing in a stone crevice on the highest peak of the mountain, the Seventh Mound. The man was approximately thirty years old and was wearing a gray gauze long coat. There were multiple wounds on his head and feet, suggesting that he was murdered and his body moved to that location. Because he was wearing a long coat, it is believed that he was killed between March and April. The local Baojia has reported the case to the court for investigation.</p>

<p>The Huijuyuan, Jizhengxing, Gu Rongsheng, and other fireworks businesses in this county reported that the arbitrary dispatch of inspectors by the Saltpeter Branch Bureau to harass their businesses was disrupting their operations. They jointly sent a letter to the Fireworks Industry Association the other day, which forwarded the letter to the County Chamber of Commerce, requesting that it forward the letter to the Saltpeter Branch Bureau, stipulating investigation methods and publicizing the regulations on search and seizure, so that they could follow them. After receiving the letter, the Chamber of Commerce immediately forwarded it to the Saltpeter Branch Bureau for consideration. Yesterday, the Chamber of Commerce received a reply from the Branch Bureau, stating that it was acting on orders from the general office to handle the contract and tax matters, which are collected monthly without exception. Within the Bureau's jurisdiction, users of saltpeter and sulfur must be investigated regularly, in addition to the announcements. The inspectors conduct their investigations of users once every week or five days. The investigation methods are governed by the Bureau's orders, public letters from the Public Security Bureau, and an investigation log. There is no ransacking of boxes or drawers. If anyone does not believe this, the two parties can be invited to a face-to-face meeting to clarify everything. After receiving the letter, the County Chamber of Commerce has forwarded it to the Fireworks Industry Association for their review.</p>

Recently, the eldest son Zaiyuan suspected that the mother had subsidized the construction of a new house for the second son Zaixing, leading to frequent conflicts. Subsequently, Zaiyuan ordered Zaixing to remove a straw pile from his house, leading to a physical altercation. Zaiyuan was overpowered and injured by a wooden stick. Yao Chen led her two younger sons in pursuit, pushing Zaiyuan into the river and drowning him. His uncle, Yao Ruifu, reported the incident. The two younger sons fled.

<h3 id="e112">Chamber of Commerce Jointly Appeals to the Government to Reimpose Import Tax on Foreign Rice <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Also Cables Guangdong Provincial Government to Jointly Advocate</p>
<p>The National Chamber of Commerce Joint Federation, considering that domestic grain is currently cheap, hurting farmers, while a massive amount of foreign rice is being imported, inevitably hindering sales and affecting the rural economy, yesterday telegraphed the government and the Ministries of Finance and Industry, stating (titles omitted): "The case concerns a previous letter from the Zhangpu County Chamber of Commerce in Fujian, requesting that we forward a request to reimpose a small import tax on rice. We duly telegraphed your government ministries on July XX of this year. On August 9th, we received Industry Ministry document number 1926 stating, 'We have received your telegram. Regarding whether to levy taxes on imported foreign rice, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce has appealed to the ministry, and the Ministry of Finance has replied, stating, "Since the meeting convened last year, the rice-producing provinces have requested the rapid imposition of import taxes, while Guangdong, a province lacking rice, argues that taxing foreign rice would harm the people's food supply and insists on dissenting. If taxes are to be imposed, they should be specified in the import tariff. However, the current import tariff is already under review by the National Government's Legislative Yuan and has not yet been finalized." ' We have recorded the aforementioned telegram and directive and have already notified you. Now we read in the August 24th newspaper report that the Nanjing Ministry of Finance, according to a customs report, "From January to July of this year, there was a trade deficit of over 289,570,000 yuan. Food ranks first among imported goods, valued at over 75,490,000 yuan. The current cheap domestic grain hurts farmers, and such a large amount of food imports is a matter of concern for the government authorities," and the Nanjing dispatch of August 31st stated, "A person in charge of the Ministry of Railways said that freight rates for grain have been reduced separately, but so far, domestic grain has not been selling well. The key lies in the duty-free import of foreign grain, which is arbitrarily encroaching on the market, and the freight rate policy is complementary to the tariff policy. If they are combined, the effect is great; if they are separated, the effect is completely lost. Therefore, supporting domestic grain production is a major issue, especially the duty-free import of foreign rice. In addition, various miscellaneous taxes and levies in the interior are also layered upon each other, forming a major obstacle to transportation and sales." "Looking at the former, the amount of foreign grain imports accounts for the largest portion of imported goods, and the claim that domestic grain is encroached upon and sold cheaply is not false. Looking at the latter, there is no shortage of domestic grain, and there is no need to rely on foreign grain, and the statement that domestic grain is being encroached upon by foreign grain and sold cheaply is even more credible. If this continues, the imports of foreign grain will increase, the sales of domestic grain will decrease, and the price will become cheaper. Now, farmers are not only worried about the drop in grain prices but also about the difficulty of selling their crops. They are struggling to survive. If we do not find ways to help, the farmers will inevitably starve to death or find other occupations. In a few years, domestic grain may indeed be insufficient to eat, and the entire country will inevitably rely on foreign grain. The Chamber is witnessing the difficulties of the times and dares not remain silent. In addition to separately telegraphing the Guangdong Provincial Government, we jointly telegraph your government ministries for review and verification, requesting that you promptly reimpose import taxes on foreign rice and eliminate miscellaneous taxes and levies, so that we can treat both the symptoms and the root causes, and there is hope for recovery. The National Chamber of Commerce United Federation respectfully bows." The association also states that the Guangdong Provincial Government believes that after the import tax on foreign rice is reimposed, grain prices will rise, hindering the people's food supply and insists on dissenting, so it specifically telegraphed the Guangdong Provincial Government, asking it to consider the overall situation and jointly advocate reimposing the import tax on foreign rice. The original telegram states (titles omitted): "The case concerns a previous letter from the Fujian Zhangpu Chamber of Commerce, requesting that we forward a request to reimpose the import tax on foreign rice. Our association duly telegraphed the National Government's Executive Yuan, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Finance, and Ministry of Industry. In August, we received the Industry Ministry's document number 19263, stating, 'We have received your telegram, etc.' (see previous excerpts). Now we read in the August 24th newspaper report that the Nanjing Ministry of Finance, according to a customs report, (excerpts omitted) Guangdong is a province that relies on foreign rice, and there is fear that once the import tax on rice is reimposed, grain prices will rise. However, the farmers in the interior are not only worried about the drop in grain prices but also about the difficulty of selling their crops. If grain prices rise, the transportation and sales of domestic grain will inevitably be crowded. Once goods flood the market, the price increase will not be significant. Moreover, to burden the entire rural population of the country with the bankruptcy for the sake of food rice in Guangdong Province is something that benevolent people would not do. In addition to re-telegraphing the Central Government, we are telegraphing Your Excellency for review, hoping that you will abandon your prejudices, consider the overall situation, and jointly advocate reimposing the import tax on foreign rice, to alleviate the farmers' distress. The National Chamber of Commerce United Federation bows."</p>

<p>Huang Fu, Chairman of the Executive Yuan's Political Affairs Reorganization Committee stationed in Beiping, and Wang Kemin, Finance Committee member, had not yet met with Song since coming to Shanghai. Wang went to visit Song yesterday afternoon at 3:00 p.m. to formally discuss North China's financial problems. First, Wang reported the difficult financial situation in North China to Song, and then immediately invited Chairman Huang Fu of the Political Affairs Committee to participate in the discussion. Huang arrived at Song's residence with guards at approximately 5:00 p.m., and the three of them talked until 7:15 p.m. before dispersing. Subsequently, Huang and Wang returned to Huang's residence for dinner. It is said that Wang Kemin has completed his official business and is expected to leave Shanghai for Beiping today or tomorrow.</p>

<p>When Huang Fu left Song's residence, a reporter from the Guowen News Agency approached him to inquire about the outcome of the talks. According to Huang, "We reported the entire financial situation in North China to Minister Song in detail. Minister Song already understands and has indicated that he has appropriate solutions. The finances of North China have always been difficult. Since the fierce fighting, income has sharply decreased, while expenditures have been very large due to the impact of the war. Therefore, the number of deficits is too large, so we urgently need to find a way to help. We are now planning to start with increasing revenue and reducing expenditure, finding ways to rectify finances and reduce political and military expenses." At this point, the reporter asked about the relief for the current financial difficulties in North China and whether Minister Song's so-called "appropriate solutions" referred to the widely circulated plan to issue public bonds. Huang replied, "This point was not discussed, and we will not issue public bonds." Finally, the reporter asked when he would return to Beiping. Huang said that he had not yet decided.</p>

<h3 id="e120">After American Cotton and Wheat Arrive in China <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Will First Be Mortgaged to Shanghai Banking Circles</p>
<p>According to Guowen News Agency, the Chinese government borrowed 50 million yuan from the United States to purchase raw cotton and wheat for shipment to China. Song Ziwen, the Minister of Finance who is negotiating this loan, has already returned to the country. The other day, Song also said that a batch of American cotton was already en route to China. Yesterday, reporters learned from industrial circles that Song had entrusted Zhang Gongquan, president of the Bank of China, and Chen Guangfu, manager of the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, to handle the loan.</p>
<p>Moreover, Chen Guangfu was originally in Qingdao, attending the annual meeting of the Chinese Economic Society. Previously, Song had telegraphed him, inviting him to Shanghai for talks. The so-called "handling" means that after the cotton and wheat arrive in China, they will first be mortgaged to various banks in Shanghai, and then the banks will resell them to the various factories that need them. Therefore, in the afternoon, reporters went to meet Chen Guangfu to ask him about the situation. According to Chen, "Mr. Ma Yinchu and I attended the annual meeting of the Chinese Economic Society in Qingdao and only returned to Shanghai yesterday (the day before yesterday). This morning, Mr. Kong Yongzhi and I visited Minister Song for a long-overdue greeting. The American cotton and wheat issue was discussed with no results. It was a superficial conversation. In any case, there must first be a plan before there can be a solution, and only with a solution can progress be made. After today's meeting with Song, it was as if we had not discussed the matter at all. So, I really cannot speculate on how the matter will proceed or how it will be handled. Minister Song will go to Nanjing in the next few days. Although I returned to Shanghai yesterday, I still plan to go to Beiping and Tianjin soon. This trip has no special business; it is the annual routine inspection of branch operations." Subsequently, the reporter asked about the Central Government raising funds from Shanghai banking circles for flood relief in North China and the Yellow River region. Chen generally replied that he had only seen it reported in the newspapers and did not know the details.</p>
<p>Regarding the arrival of American cotton and wheat in China, according to sources in the cotton industry, the first batch will not arrive in Shanghai until mid-September at the earliest. Considering the purchase price in the United States and the addition of tariffs and freight after arriving in China, the price per bale will far exceed the domestic market price by about one-sixth. It is questionable how it can be sold. Not only is the price of cotton like this, but also the price of wheat shipped to China in the future will certainly not be cheaper than the domestic market price. This is indeed one of the most difficult points after the American cotton and wheat are shipped to China.</p>

<p>Retire Elderly Postal Workers</p>
<p>According to Huang Naishu, Director of the Postal Administration, speaking to a reporter from the Central News Agency yesterday, regarding the issue of increasing postage rates to Southeast Asia, the post office has repeatedly sent personnel to major ports such as Guangzhou, Xiamen, and Shantou to separately explain to those involved in overseas Chinese affairs due to opposition from overseas Chinese. Understanding has been reached, so it has been decided that starting tomorrow (today), all mail sent to Southeast Asia will be affixed with sufficient postage stamps according to the new regulations: 12.5 cents for regular letters and an additional 20 cents for registered letters. According to the budget, this will increase postage revenue by 100,000 yuan per year. The dismissal of 32 elderly postal workers will also be announced tomorrow (today). Each person will receive two months' salary as a retirement bonus to show preferential treatment, which will also save 100,000 yuan in expenses per year.</p>

<p>The Fujian bandits and communists have been severely suppressed by the army in recent days, and the bandit army has been repelled. Not only is Fuzhou as peaceful as usual, but also Yanping has not been lost. However, foreigners, misunderstanding the truth, upon hearing of bandit alerts, use the protection of overseas Chinese as an excuse and send warships to Fujian one after another, alarming international public opinion. This is also the pain suffered by a weak country.</p>
<p>Japanese Navy Third Fleet Commander Minai received a telegram from the Japanese Ministry of the Navy, ordering that in addition to dispatching one cruiser and two destroyers from Sasebo directly to Fujian to prepare for the evacuation of Japanese overseas Chinese, the Third Fleet in Shanghai should also dispatch warships to Fuzhou to assist in the protection of overseas Chinese. Commander Minai, upon receiving the order, dispatched four destroyers from the 24th squadron stationed in Shanghai to Fuzhou yesterday.</p>

<p>According to the Shanghai Xujiahui Astronomical Observatory's report at 9:00 p.m. last night, there will be rainstorms along the coast from Taiwan to Shanghai. The weather in Taiwan and the East China Sea is extremely bad. A hurricane near Mikushima (transliteration) is blowing northwest and may attack the Zhejiang coast. Another hurricane near Naha (transliteration) is progressing northwest.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom and the United States also have overseas Chinese merchants in Fujian, so they have each sent two warships to Fuzhou. Currently, the Japanese naval authorities have consulted with the commanders of the British and American navies stationed in Asia, taking the same steps for warships entering Fujian. It is reported that Minai has telegraphed the Japanese Consul in Fuzhou, ordering him to contact this matter.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Continued News of Labor Strike at British American Tobacco Factories <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Workers in the Printing Department Plan to Resume Work Yesterday but Failed</p>
<p>The Union Petitions for Investigation into the Withdrawal of Some Workers</p>
<p>According to Dagong News Agency, after the workers of the British American Tobacco Company's old and new factories announced a general strike, the factory's attitude remained firm, and the situation has not been resolved. The other day, the workers in the new factory's printing department advocated resuming work, which caused a reaction from the workers in other departments, leading to internal disputes. Yesterday morning at 8:00 a.m., more than 100 workers from the printing department went to the municipal government to petition. The union submitted a petition to party and government organs requesting an investigation. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Failure to Resume Work After the workers of the old and new factories announced a general strike, the more than 700 workers in the printing department of the British American Tobacco Company's second factory in Puxi also participated as a whole. Now, due to internal differences of opinion, some workers gathered the other day and advocated resuming work, which led to a reaction from other workers. The workers in the printing department went to the factory as usual at 7:00 a.m. yesterday. When they were about to start working between the large rolling stone machines, the Western staff in that department prevented them from causing disturbances and incidents, so the resumption of work failed. The workers then went to the municipal government to petition for assistance.</p>
<p>Petitioning the Municipal Government Because of the failure to resume work, the workers in the new factory's printing department elected more than 100 representatives to cross the river to the municipal government to petition. After the municipal government received the report, it specially ordered the security team to send more than 20 patrol officers to dissuade them and instructed them to elect five representatives. The workers immediately elected Pan Quanrong and four others as representatives to visit Secretary-General Yu, requesting two points: (1) They have been idle for a long time, and their livelihood is worrying. Please order the factory to start the machines immediately. (2) Please order the Public Security Bureau to send police to protect the work. Secretary-General Yu replied, saying that the British American Tobacco Company workers had formed a legal union and should submit a petition through the union. If the union handles it improperly, more than two-thirds of the workers should submit a joint petition. The workers' petition today is not in accordance with the law, although it will be accepted, resulting in no results and a withdrawal.</p>
<p>Temporarily Not Mediating Yesterday, the Dagong News Agency reporter inquired with party and government organs about their attitude towards handling the British American Tobacco labor strike. According to the staff in charge, the British American Tobacco case is too complicated to resolve in a short time, and the factory's attitude is firm. Although the municipal government has drafted several solutions, it has refused to implement them, so mediation is likely to be ineffective at this time. All the pending cases have now been submitted to the municipal government for instructions and plan to temporarily not convene mediation again.</p>
<p>Petition for Investigation The Fifth District Cigarette Workers' Union submitted a petition to party and government organs yesterday, stating that Pan Quanrong, a worker in the rolling stone department of the new factory's printing department, has been used by the factory to preside over reactionary actions and fabricate false statements to threaten a resumption of work. They have already submitted a request for severe sanctions. Today, Pan Quanrong and others led the workers in that department into the factory to work. The entire workers, upon hearing the news, were greatly offended. The Western manager of that department, fearing conflicts that would damage the factory's machinery, refused to allow Pan Quanrong and others to start the machines. The factory then prepared two small boats, ordered Pan and others to lead more than 100 workers, including non-workers, to the municipal government to petition, with all expenses paid by the factory, and ordered Pan and others to organize a printing department union separately, hoping to sow discord and undermine unity. This illegal behavior is obviously a reactionary intention. They are willing to be the factory's lackeys.</p>
<p>This is clearly revealed. For this reason, Pan Quanrong's reactionary situation is continuously reported for review. It is requested that Pan Quanrong be severely sanctioned to serve as a warning, maintain the labor movement, and await orders. Respectfully submitted to the Municipal Party Department and the Social Affairs Bureau. The Union's question to the New Voice News Agency: The workers in the new factory's printing department sent a letter to the standing committee of the union yesterday, asking them to order the Third Factory on Taopeng Road to participate in the strike, otherwise the workers in that department would resume work immediately. The original letter stated: "We heard that the representatives' meeting on the 28th produced a strike</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>Committee. In the 16th year of the Republic of China, the strike for national taxes was guaranteed by the government. We have heard that there are still private workers, and after the resumption of work, our association does not have legitimate means to deal with these people. Now, the Third Factory has been established for many years, and its scope is far greater than our department. The people have always been extremely obedient to the mission of our association, so they have recently expressed their concern. We heard that your committee has people who jointly expressed their views with the Third Factory, but this has now become a bubble. Lessons can be learned from the past.</p>
<p>Therefore, all the workers in our department are in a state of panic and are making an inevitable request. We implore your committee to quickly express its views together with the Third Factory tomorrow morning, otherwise our department will act in accordance with the Third Factory, and our department will not be responsible for anything.</p>
<p>According to the petition group of the British American Tobacco Company workers, the labor strike at the British American Tobacco Company in Pudong has not been resolved for many days. Yesterday, the workers in the factory's printing department underwent another change. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Detaining Representatives Because the workers' strike has caused the factory losses, the Old Jinlong Foreign Firm recruited printing workers from the Commercial Press to replace them and transferred the printing machines from the Pudong factory to the Third Factory. The workers, seeing this, were extremely panic. They sent a letter to the union, requesting to take the same steps as the Third Factory to prevent the factory from taking advantage. They elected Pan Quanrong as their representative to state their opinions and request a solution. Unexpectedly, the union misunderstood that Pan Quanrong was instructing the workers to make trouble for the union and detained Pan. The workers, upon hearing the news, were extremely angry and questioned the union. Fei Keguang, Lou Jingguan, Huang Ajiin, and Bao Yangzhou, members of the union's council, blocked their way. The workers could not enter the union, but they were dissuaded by ten patrol officers from the Public Security Bureau. The workers who had reached the factory then unanimously decided to petition the municipal government for a solution. Yesterday morning at 8:00 a.m., all 600 workers in that department organized a petition group and petitioned the municipal government.</p>
<p>At that time, Pan Quanrong, Xu Wenqing, Chen Sihong, Zhang Xiqi, and Chen Shengkui were elected as temporary representatives and were received by Secretary-General Yu Hongjun. The workers stated their reasons, and Secretary-General Yu instructed them that the workers' willingness to resume work and their distrust of the union were their own feelings, and they could freely decide whether they needed to protest. As for the union's detention of representatives and intimidation, he would definitely investigate them strictly and had asked Public Security Bureau Chief Wen to pay attention to the security in Pudong to avoid accidents, and he gently persuaded the workers to return home. The workers were quite satisfied when they heard this.</p>
<p>Withdrawing from the Union Because the union could not seek benefits for the workers and the handling of the strike was improper, all 600 workers in that department withdrew from the union and will resume work today.</p>

<p>Telephone Bureau to Remove Them by the End of September</p>
<p>Sends Letters to Users to Apply for Reinstallation</p>
<p>According to Dagong News Agency, the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications is now taking back all telephone lines installed by the Shanghai Telephone Company within the Chinese boundary in accordance with the temporary telephone contract in order to maintain sovereignty. The cross-border telephone lines in the South and Zhabei districts will all be removed by September 30th. The same will be done in Pudong after the branch office is established. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e126">Recovering Cross-Border Line Rights <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>According to Xu Xueyu, Director of the Telephone Bureau, speaking to a reporter from Dagong News Agency yesterday, before the temporary telephone contract was signed, the concession telephone company directly ran lines into the Chinese boundary and installed telephones, including 32 telephones in the South City District, more than 10 telephones in the Zhabei District, and more than 240 telephones in the Pudong District. The monthly rental fees, installation fees, and deposit fees for these telephones were all collected by the concession telephone company. This not only caused economic losses to our bureau but also hindered sovereignty. Now our bureau has decided to take back all the telephones installed by the Shanghai Telephone Company in the Chinese boundary or cross-border areas in accordance with the contract. We will first remove them in the North and South cities by the deadline, and the same will be done in Pudong after the branch office is established.</p>

<p>The sky lines of the Shanghai Telephone Company leading to the North and South cities and the submarine cables in the Huangpu River in Pudong are connected to cross-border telephones. Users in the Chinese boundary call the concession, or users in the concession call the Chinese boundary, all directly connected by the company. The Telephone Bureau has no transfer rights. After the cross-border telephones are removed, the sky lines will be cut off between the boundaries and reconnected to the distribution machine. The submarine cable in Pudong has been sold and purchased by the bureau.</p>
<h3 id="e128">User Notification Regarding Reinstallation <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Telephone Bureau yesterday issued a notification to all users, which stated: Greetings. Since the signing of the temporary agreement for telephones in this city, all telephones installed by the Shanghai Telephone Company within the Chinese-controlled areas should be taken back by this Bureau immediately in order to maintain sovereignty. This Bureau now stipulates that the telephones in the concession areas of the Nanshi and Zhabei districts will be dismantled before September 30th of this year. As for the Pudong area, once a branch bureau is established, they will also be taken back according to the regulations. Regarding whether your users still need to reinstall the Bureau's telephones after the concession telephones are dismantled, please fill out the attached form and mail it to this Bureau before September 10th for review. Otherwise, if the attached form is not mailed before September 10th, this Bureau will consider that your users are willing to have the concession telephones dismantled and will not reinstall the Bureau's telephones. Therefore, this Bureau will not be responsible for any obstacles and losses incurred after the telephone dismantling. Please be informed and respond promptly. Respectfully, [signed] Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation, August 31st.</p>

<p>The Telephone Bureau also issued another notification to all users, which stated: Since we combined the China-Concession call fees with the monthly rental, the number of call requests per day has increased three times compared to before. The Bureau's losses are very significant. However, there are only fifty pairs of lines and only six switching seats. Therefore, we are unable to handle all the call requests promptly, and users often have to wait a long time. This is something the Bureau deeply regrets and asks for your understanding. The Bureau is currently working on expansion and adding equipment. At the same time, the Bureau hopes that your users will not abuse calls to concession telephones unless there are urgent matters, in order to reduce time and economic losses. Furthermore, if the switchboard operators are impolite to your users, please immediately inquire about their number, and report the time, your own telephone number, and the number being called to the Bureau in detail. We will handle it according to the regulations. However, the facts must be accurate, and malicious accusations should be avoided at all costs.</p>

<h3 id="e131">The China Merchants Bureau Reorganizes Shipping, Changes Supervisors, and Disputes Arise <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>It is Evident How Difficult it is to Eliminate Malpractices</p>
<p>Among Chinese steamships, the deepest-rooted malpractices are the comprador system, followed by the stewards and supervisors. Now, Liu Hongsheng, the general manager of the China Merchants Bureau, is resolutely reforming the various bad systems of the ships one by one. On the "Puan" and "Xinming" ships, the comprador system has been abolished. The "Xinming's" steward was found to be corrupt and incited a crowd to disobey orders, and Liu forcibly removed him from the ship. Now, he has taken a further step and is changing the bad supervisors. Initially, it was a minor matter, but now it has developed into a major dispute, or perhaps this is the process that those who reorganize shipping affairs must go through.</p>
<p>Supervisors Neglect Their Duties On various ships, there is a position of supervisor, who is specifically responsible for the meals of the crew members. Recently, all the crew members of the "Xinjiangtian" ship reported to General Manager Liu that the food for the crew members was getting worse and worse. According to the meal expenses issued by the Bureau, they should not be eating such coarse food. This is obviously the supervisor's neglect of duty and should be changed. Other crew members on the Yangtze River ships also complained, saying that the supervisors were ineffective, resulting in the waste of money and causing intangible losses to the crew members. After receiving the report, Liu first sent someone to secretly investigate and verify the facts, and then implemented the change of supervisors.</p>
<p>Approval of the Change of Supervisors Liu reported this matter to the board of directors, requesting that the board of directors approve the change of supervisors of the various ships in the name of the board of directors. The board of directors believed that it was not necessary for the board of directors to approve the transfer of a supervisor. Later, they realized that this matter was seemingly small but actually large, so they immediately followed Liu's request and transferred Wang Shenggao, the supervisor of "Xinjiangtian," to serve as the supervisor of "Jiangda," and appointed Ren Tangsheng, the supervisor of "Jiangxin," to "Xinjiangtian." Fang Anquan of "Jiangda" was transferred to "Jiangxin," while Zhang Jinsheng of "Jianghua" and Fan Xinbiao of "Jiangyu" were exchanged.</p>
<p>Resisting Transfer After the Bureau's order was issued, Wang Gaosheng of "Xinjiangtian" was the first to disobey the order and refused to hand over, causing Ren Tangsheng to be unable to board the ship to take over. Wang Shenggao did not even go to the ship and avoided meeting. Because of his obstruction, the Bureau's order was not implemented, and all the ships were blocked. In recent days, the "Xinjiangtian" ship has been sailing without a supervisor. However, Liu is determined to implement this matter to maintain dignity and eradicate malpractices. Now, the "Xinjiangtian" ship will be suspended for repairs, and this problem should be resolved in these few days. If Wang Shenggao continues to disobey the order, Liu will take severe action.</p>
<p>Seamen Oppose Wang Shenggao has reported this matter to the preparatory committee of the Seamen's Union, and the Union has sent a letter to Liu Hongsheng, stating that if the Bureau can freely transfer and dismiss the supervisors based on the dissatisfaction of the crew members, then the personnel on the ships will lose the guarantee of their positions in the future. As long as a certain crew member is not satisfied, they can be arbitrarily dismissed. The Seamen's Union expressed that they could not sympathize with this matter and requested General Manager Liu to immediately withdraw the transfer order and allow the supervisors to continue in their original positions. It is heard that Liu considers the current change of supervisors of the various ships to be one of the important matters for reorganizing the internal affairs of the ships. If they resist the order or use other forces to confront the Bureau, the Bureau will submit a request to the Ministry to order the transfer in order to vigorously carry out the reorganization. Therefore, the future of this dispute is still difficult to predict.</p>

<h3 id="e133">Farmers from Caoguanjing Petitioned Party and Government Agencies Yesterday <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>To Avoid Renting Farmland at Longhua Airport</p>
<p>And Forward a Request to the Ministry of Transportation to Withdraw its Order</p>
<p>Tang Muquan and 23 other farmers from the Longhua Airport area in Caoguanjing, whose farmland near the airport was encircled by the airline, gathered more than 50 men and women and petitioned various Party and government agencies yesterday morning around 10:00 AM, requesting the authorities to order the avoidance of renting and immediately instruct the local bailiff to stop the process, and forward a request to the Ministry of Transportation to withdraw its order. The Municipal Party Headquarters sent Zhao Erchang from the Civil Training Section to receive them, who replied that he would forward the request on their behalf. The representatives of the people were satisfied and left. The original petition to the Municipal Government is as follows: Petition for avoiding the renting of farmland at Longhua Airport in Caoguanjing District, immediately ordering the local bailiff to stop the process, and forwarding a request to the Ministry of Transportation to withdraw its order. The undersigned and their families have always relied on farmland for a living. Now, an airline has filed with the Ministry of Transportation and the Ministry of Interior to develop public air transportation, intending to expand the airport and forcibly rent the people's farmland, as evidenced by the notice issued by Yang Xinzheng, Municipal Committee Member of Caoguanjing District, on April 16th. Later, because the people submitted a document to the Party Headquarters on April 25th, complaining about the forced rental of farmland without following the procedures of the Land Law, and also petitioned your government, although there was no written reply exempting the encirclement, there was no forced process. Now, after the notice from the Land Bureau was obtained on July 26th, the people again jointly requested the Land Bureau on August 16th to exempt the rental for four reasons, and earnestly request your government to put the case on file. Now, without any approval, Lin Jizuo colluded with the local bailiff Ji Zhukang to forcibly drive wooden stakes into the people's land for encirclement and use, and wanted to forcibly dig up the people's tombs and ancestral graves. Are these methods in line with the Land Use Law? The undersigned have no choice but to petition your government to rescue the farmers, quickly order an investigation to stop it, and will be extremely grateful. Respectfully submitted to the Mayor of Shanghai Wu, by petitioners Tang Muquan, Wei Hongsheng, Zhang Jilu, Gao Lianbao, Shen Liangchen, Tang Xiuchang, Tang Chuntao, Tang Xintang, Yang Fushan, Cai Yinshan, Gao Fengming, Wang Dianchen, Shi Bosun, Hu Zhuming, Wu Amei, Hu Liansheng, Li Tangsheng, Li Liansheng, Xue Dumei, Xue Qiuyuan, Ding Qiusheng, Tang Ruifa, Zhao Huisheng.</p>

<p>Detailed Account of the Financial Exhaustion in Guizhou Province</p>
<p>You Wang's troops in Guizhou have been at war for a long time. You Guocai, in order to preserve his strength, retreated to the border of Yunnan, still planning to wait for an opportunity to move. Yesterday, Deng Mingjie, the representative of Sichuan's Liu (Xiang) in Shanghai, received a telegram from You Guocai entrusted to forward to He Yingqin, which detailed the financial exhaustion in Guizhou Province and the presence of troops everywhere. The original telegram stated: Mr. Deng Mingjie, please translate and forward it to Teacher He Jingzhi [He Yingqin]. Confidential. Recently, Long Zhigong [Long Yun] forwarded the Yang Telegram, soliciting opinions on going out. I respectfully believe that my teacher is concerned about his homeland and considers going out to suppress bandits as a way to end the conflict. After reading it, I am filled with admiration and shame. I belong to the military and have always been under your guidance. It would be my sincere wish to lead my troops out and follow your lead in suppressing the Communist bandits. However, the reality is that Guizhou is full of troops. In addition to my troops and Jiang and Che's divisions, a large portion should also be transferred out to concentrate our strength and reduce the burden. Before we can move, however, we need to secure funding for deployment and regular supplies. The finances in Guizhou are more exhausted than ever before. A large portion of the tax revenue has already been pre-collected by Shao Wu [Wang Jialie]. If that is not enough, he has issued over one million yuan in non-convertible paper money. If that is still not enough, he has added six million yuan in post-war reconstruction bonds. For Guizhou, which lives on debt, it is not possible to rashly send troops without first resolving the funding issue. Furthermore, Shao Wu [Wang Jialie] is currently advancing his troops in Tongren without stopping. If we do not first stop him, it will be difficult to discuss sending troops. My teacher is concerned about his homeland and will surely see the key to the problem and grant a solution. I await your urgent instructions. Your student, You Guocai, respectfully kowtows.</p>

<p>Guowen News Agency reports that Xu Shiying, chairman of the National Government Relief Committee, suffered from severe insomnia and went to Lushan for rest. Now, due to the Yellow River bursting its banks and causing a disaster, he forced himself to go to Beijing to plan relief efforts. Furthermore, due to the requests of the Shanghai-based charity organizations, he came to Shanghai from Beijing yesterday morning. According to Xu, during his time in Beijing, he has already contacted the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission, the Huai River Guidance Committee, and the affected governments and relief associations to discuss relief measures for the Yellow River disaster. Yesterday (i.e., the day before yesterday), the Executive Yuan's political affairs meeting also discussed it. After arriving in Shanghai, regarding relief efforts, it has been decided to convene a joint meeting of the Xinwei Relief Association, various Shanghai charity organizations, and the Northeast Refugee Relief Joint Association at 4:00 PM on September 1st to discuss fundraising and emergency relief methods.</p>

<p>Three Representatives Wept and Spoke at the Red Swastika Society</p>
<p>The Anhui Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai, due to the severe bandit disaster in Yingfu, specially appointed representatives Lü Yinnan, Ma Zhuoqing, and Wang Zhuru to take a letter to the head office of the Red Swastika Society on Danshui Road to plead for the disaster victims. The original letter is transcribed as follows: Greetings. The bandits in Fuyang, colluding with the defeated troops from Henan Province, numbering about ten thousand, have disturbed the three southwestern and eastern townships of the county and the southwestern township of Yingshang County. After being blocked by the troops, they repeatedly detoured into the territory of Fuyang, occupying the three southern, northern, and western townships of Taihe County, and also disturbed the areas of Dianji, Suji, Wang Laorenji, and Dingbei Guanjihua Ji in northern Fuyang. They burned, killed, raped, and plundered wherever they went. This association has repeatedly received telegrams from various French nationals in Fuyang and Yingshang counties, asking for help. The miserable situation is unbearable to read. It is estimated that 90% of the entire territory of Fuyang, and 50-60% of Yingshang and Taihe, have been devastated. The disaster area extends for three to four hundred miles. No less than 10,000 people have been killed, raped, and injured, or maimed. The bandits have turned villages and towns into ruins. Five to six hundred thousand disaster victims are starving. Therefore, we specially appoint representatives Lü Yinnan, Ma Zhuoqing, and Wang Zhuru to present the disaster situation. We hope that you will consider the disaster victims and urgently need help. Please quickly allocate funds to rescue them. According to the oral account of the three representatives, Lü, Ma, and Wang, the bandits set fire to houses wherever they went, and robbed both men and women, rich and poor. They tied several people together and interrogated them several times a day. Those who could not afford to redeem their tickets were immediately killed, or beaten to death with clubs, or had their scalps cut open and mercury poured in. After a while, their entire skin would peel off, and then they would be pierced with a knife. When they encountered women, if they refused to be raped, they would be beaten to death and their bodies stripped naked, with small sticks inserted into their lower parts. The bandits would clap their hands and laugh. If a young woman was holding a baby in her arms, they would snatch the baby away, throw it to the ground to death, and then force the young woman to satisfy their lust. Corpses were scattered along the way, and it was a shocking sight. Abandoned babies were crying everywhere, and the sound of refugees filled the fields. While speaking, tears streamed down their faces. The representatives of the Red Swastika Society comforted them and informed the association representatives that they had sent a special commissioner, Wang Guxuan, to Yingfu to investigate and provide relief. Only then did they leave. However, the disaster area is vast, the number of disaster victims is large, and the refugees have not yet returned home. A small amount of money will not help. We sincerely hope that all charity groups will rise up to rescue them.</p>
<h3 id="e137">The Zhejiang Public Association Submits a Document to the Zhejiang Provincial Government <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Requesting Changes in the Land Survey Method</p>
<p>And Suspending the Collection of Surveying Fees</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Public Association submitted a document to the Zhejiang Provincial Government, stating: To the Zhejiang Provincial Government: Land consolidation should begin with land surveying. Zhejiang Province's land tax follows the old system of the Ming and Qing dynasties. Since the Taiping Rebellion, many fish-scale registers in various counties have been scattered and lost. In the past century, there have been changes in rivers and waterways, siltation and erosion of sand, and reforms in military and garrison colonies, the construction of railways and highways, the amount of land has long been lost, the taxes only have a false name, the tax is not entirely based on the land, and the grain is not transferred with the household. It is not only the wealthy and cunning people who have encroached and concealed land. Land surveying is indeed a matter that cannot be delayed. However, recently, when people from Zhejiang come to Shanghai and talk about land surveying, they are terrified. This is not unfounded moaning, but because the land surveying plan has flaws. Now, let's mention two points: (I) Land surveying expenses should not be charged to the people first. Recently, the Finance Department has been handling the land parcel maps, and the expenses are paid from the old tax items collected from the 16th to 19th years, and the people have no objections. Now it is heard that the surveying expenses are set at 5 jiao of silver per mu, and the Finance Departments have instructed the counties to collect the surveying fees in advance. Thus, the Jiaxing County Government decided to collect 2 jiao of silver per mu first. Those less than one mu will be counted as one mu. If the fees are collected in this way, even small farmers will have to pay several yuan of silver. In recent years, silkworm farming has failed and rice prices have plummeted. How can the farmers who have been in trouble for a long time bear this huge burden? Moreover, before the land surveying has started, the farmers are asked to pay money first, which is similar to extortion. This association believes that it is not possible. It is found that in the 18th year, when the land declaration was carried out, 1 jiao and 2 fen of silver were collected per mu, and the province could collect several million. In the 19th year, the land consolidation fee was collected, with 3 jiao of silver attached to each liang of land tax and each dan of subsidies, which is also not a small amount. The purpose of these two items is to organize the land. The provincial government should first allocate them to be used for land surveying. It is reasonable to take it from the people if it is not enough. It should be ordered to stop the collection of land surveying fees in various counties to relieve the people's difficulties. (II) The land surveying method must consider the people's strength. This time, the land surveying is carried out using the large and small angle surveying, extending the use of technical personnel, purchasing application equipment, which requires a lot of expenses. It is heard that Hangzhou City and County first carried out land surveying, with the help of the Finance Departments, borrowing 1 million yuan of commercial loans, but it has not been completed yet. By analogy, each county will average 500,000 yuan, and the province will need a total of 37.5 million. At this time of poverty, how can we get this huge amount of money? If the expenses are not enough, it will inevitably be abandoned halfway. Land consolidation, the old method uses bow and arrow, and the new method uses aircraft surveying, or large triangle surveying, or triangle root surveying. If you want to be accurate, the new method is better, but the old method of using bow and arrow can also achieve the same effect as surveying if you are serious. The cost can be saved tenfold. A few years ago, Tongxiang County spent more than 40,000 yuan on land surveying, and Huangyan County is also said to be the same. If the surveying is clear, the old method can still be used. If the surveying is not clear, the new method will also lose its effect. The old method can be fraudulent, and the new method is not necessarily not fraudulent. Why must we use large triangle surveying, so that the provincial treasury and the people's strength cannot bear it? Now, the Finance Departments have organized the land parcel maps, and the counties have gradually completed them, which is enough for the surveying. The surveying can also get relatively accurate results. It should be requested to change the land surveying method, reduce expenses, and care for the people's strength. In addition to the surveying personnel, the organization of the land surveying office in each county has provincial instructors, office directors, general affairs team leaders, team members, assistants, etc., with salaries ranging from 180 yuan to 56 yuan. In addition, the salary of the surveying personnel and the expenses are very large, and the organization should also be reduced and the expenses reduced. The above-mentioned points have been approved by the general meeting of members of this association. It should be requested that the government should approve, adopt, and implement it, which is convenient for the public. Sincerely, the Shanghai Zhejiang Public Association.</p>

<p>Recently, the Huidefeng Barge Company on the Bund of the French Concession fired a worker, which caused the opposition of all the workers, requesting the company to restore the job of the dismissed worker. However, the company refused to reinstate him because the dismissed worker was not working hard enough on weekdays. At 10:30 yesterday morning, all the workers gathered to negotiate with the company, and the order was disrupted for a while. The French police heard the report and sent a large number of detectives to suppress the situation, and arrested three ringleaders and sent them to the police station. The rest scattered. Afterwards, the workers stated that the company must release the three arrested persons and reinstate the dismissed person, otherwise there will be a serious attitude to deal with.</p>

<p>The Loading and Unloading Fees are Added to the Freight Ticket and Collected by the Railways</p>
<p>The Transportation Department of the Jinghu and Huhu-Ningpo Railway Administration, in order to standardize the collection method of loading and unloading fees for intermodal freight, specially issued a letter to the relevant parties, saying: In order to standardize the collection procedures of loading and unloading fees for freight at various stations of the two railways, the methods are different due to the different situations of each station. It is now stipulated that all loading and unloading fees for freight intermodal between the two railways and the Jinpu Railway or the Hangjiang Railway shall be added to the freight ticket and collected by the railways. For example, for "prepaid" freight tickets, the originating station shall calculate and collect them together. For "collect on delivery" freight tickets, the destination station shall calculate and collect them together and submit them to the accounting office. At the end of the month (the stations that have already submitted reports on a ten-day basis may still handle them on a ten-day basis), the station shall issue a bill for the loading or unloading fees that should be obtained and submit it to this department for review and transfer to the accounting office for verification, and then directly allocate it to unify the system. As for the freight transportation of this railway and the loading and unloading fees for the intermodal freight of the two railways, the previous practices shall be temporarily followed.</p>

<p>Since its opening, the Tongyuan Commercial Savings Bank on Tianjin Road has been very prosperous in its business. The business of commercial transactions, mortgage loans, and exchange of various ports has been thriving, especially the savings part, which has been developing rapidly. This is because the department handles various savings with simple procedures and generous interest rates, so it is very popular among all sectors. Recently, it has created a fifteen-year savings plan, saving 17 yuan, 4 jiao, and 1 fen per month. When the fifteen-year period expires, you can get 82 yuan, 5 jiao, and 9 fen per month. From then on, you can withdraw forever from generation to generation. Such a one-time savings plan is still a novelty in Shanghai.</p>

<h3 id="e142">Another Korean Political Assassination in the Lixin Lane of Dixiwei Road <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>The Deceased, Liu Yinfa, Was a Core Pro-Japanese Figure</p>
<p>The Murderer Escaped the Scene and is Being Sought by All Parties</p>
<p>At 6:05 yesterday morning, an assassination case occurred in No. 32 Lixin Lane, Dixiwei Road in this port. The injured was a Korean named Liu Yinfa, a core pro-Japanese figure among the Koreans in Shanghai. This assassination is clearly related to politics. The investigation results are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e143">Circumstances of the Assassination <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Liu Yinfa, a 35-year-old Korean, lived at No. 32 Lixin Lane, Dixiwei Road. He had a chauffeur-driven car for his commutes. Liu had a wife and four children, and his family was quite wealthy. Liu was the chairman of the Korean Friendship Association, which was composed of a portion of Koreans in Shanghai. In the past, he and the late Yu Guanbin, the owner of the Foci Pharmaceutical Factory who was also assassinated, jointly presided over it. Since Yu's death, all the association affairs were handled by Liu personally. The association is a pro-Japanese organization, and its daily work is quite busy. Liu would go to the association to work every morning at 9:00 AM. Unexpectedly, at about 6:00 yesterday morning, a Korean youth wearing a suit and speaking Japanese knocked on the back door of Liu's residence. When the Chinese maid hired by Liu opened the door and invited him in, the maid saw that she did not know him and wanted to refuse him. At this time, the youth took out a pistol, forbade her from making any noise, and forced her to lead him to Liu's bedroom. The maid was stunned and was forced to go upstairs. The youth rushed into Liu's bedroom. At that time, Liu had already heard the noise downstairs and hurriedly put on his clothes and got out of bed. When he opened the door, the youth took out a pistol and shot Liu six times. Liu fell to the ground in response. His wife woke up in shock and saw her husband bleeding like a spring. She screamed for help in Korean. The youth was anxious and shot Liu's wife again before fleeing downstairs. Fortunately, Liu's wife dodged quickly and only suffered a graze to her lower abdomen. However, she also fell to the ground in extreme pain.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Sent to the Hospital for Treatment <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Afterwards, the maid downstairs and Liu's coachman, A Er, a Jiangbei native, heard the gunshots and knew that something had happened. They went upstairs to inspect and saw that the master and mistress had fallen in a pool of blood. However, they were still able to groan. They immediately reported to the police station and the Fifth District Third Police Station, and then sent them by car to the Fumin Hospital on North Sichuan Road, Haining Road for treatment. The hospital examined them. Liu was shot in four places: one in the left armpit, one in the chest, one in the lower abdomen, and one bullet in the lung that did not penetrate. Liu's wife only suffered a graze to her lower abdomen, so she was discharged after bandaging. Liu underwent surgery and was still conscious. It is said that if his condition does not change today, there should be no danger to his life.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Post-Incident Investigation <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>After the incident, reporters went to Liu's residence to conduct a thorough investigation and discovered a box of business cards bearing the title "Chairman of the Korean Friends Association, hosted by Liu." It was also learned that besides being the current chairman of the Friends Association, Liu had previously served as a member of the Shanghai American Volunteer Group, had resided in Europe and America for a considerable time, and was currently also employed in the electroplating department of the American-owned company. According to the Japanese side, his assassination must have been carried out by anti-Japanese elements among the Koreans residing in Shanghai. Furthermore, the shell casings found in Liu's bedroom were examined and found to be of the same type as the handgun used in the assassination of Yu Guanbin. Currently, the police and local stations are conducting a rigorous investigation. At the same time, the Japanese consulate is taking the successive assassinations very seriously and is also undertaking a careful search for the perpetrators.</p>

<p>Launching a Retribution Squad in the Early Hours</p>
<p>Both Parties Sent to Court for Questioning and Judgment</p>
<p>Yang Keming, a native of Ningbo, twenty-eight years old, was fond of frequenting brothels. Since last year, he had formed an inseparable bond with a prostitute (stage name: Yifei Laoqi), real name Feng Xiuzhen, at residence number 6, Fuyu Lane, Yunnan Road. The prostitute, like Yang, was born in Changzhou. The previous evening, Yang again went to the brothel to host a banquet. As the party waned and the lights dimmed, another uninvited guest suddenly barged in. Laoqi immediately led him to another room, treating him with obsequious attentiveness, as this man, named Shi Jinnan, a native of Shaoxing, had an intimate relationship with her. He operated a Hongyuan Paint and Hardware Store on Hankou Road and was clearly a prosperous merchant. That evening, Shi had initially hosted a banquet at someone else's home, and after the gathering dispersed, fueled by lingering alcohol, he specifically visited Laoqi, intending for a private chat. Unexpectedly, the two men encountered each other, leaving Laoqi feeling awkward and uneasy. Fortunately, Yang understood the situation and abandoned his desire to stay, departing hastily. However, at five o'clock the next morning, Yang suddenly led several of his fellow townsmen, including Han Shuiqiao, into the brothel. Seeing Shi still sound asleep in the room, he felt a surge of jealousy. With a furious roar, Yang woke Shi. Wielding a written agreement in one hand and raising his fist in the other, he sternly rebuked Shi: "Who are you? How dare you sleep with my fiancée? I have caught you tonight, what do you have to say for yourself? If you resist, my fist may not show mercy!" Shi, hearing this, believed that a prostitute was fair game for anyone, and that staying overnight in a brothel was none of Yang's business. Therefore, he showed no fear of Yang's intimidating behavior. Yang then realized that Shi was not a weakling either. Having embarked on this course, he had no choice but to retrieve an opium smoking set and then go outside to summon Chinese constables from station number 1921. He then accused the brothel of privately hiding smoking paraphernalia and also accused Yang and Laoqi of sleeping together, both violations of brothel regulations, requesting the constables to investigate. Consequently, both parties were taken to the Old Gate Police Station. Under questioning by the police chief, Yang claimed that Laoqi was his fiancée and was ordered to provide evidence. Yang then presented the written agreement he held, which stated: "Agreement: Male, Yang Keming; Female, Feng Xiuzhen. Due to mutual affection, both parties agree to enter into a lifelong commitment. A formal marriage ceremony will be held at the end of this year. Both parties must fulfill this agreement. If the male party reneges, he will compensate the female party with 2,000 yuan. If the female party reneges, she will compensate the male party with 2,000 yuan. Currently, the female party works as a courtesan in a brothel and is not allowed to entertain other guests. If she entertains other guests, she will also compensate according to the above amount. To prevent future disputes, this agreement is made, each party holding a copy for record. July [day missing], 22nd year. Witnessed by lawyer Cao Lin." An investigator, Feng Xiushan, was dispatched to inquire with lawyer Cao Lin. According to Cao Lin, Yang Keming had requested him to witness the agreement, but he had not seen Feng Xiuzhen in person, nor did he know whether Feng agreed to it. The police chief, believing that Cao Lin could not vouch for the validity of the agreement, concluded that Yang had fabricated the document with the intention of fraud and extortion, and immediately detained him as well. Yesterday morning, both were handed over to the First Special District Local Court, where Judge Qian Hongye conducted the preliminary hearing. The police lawyer, Ru Baoyi, presented the case, stating that the defendant Yang Keming had been sentenced to six months in prison at the age of eighteen for forging documents, and had recently been sentenced to one month in prison for theft in the French Concession, demonstrating his lack of good character. Judge Qian then questioned the witnesses and ordered both defendants to be held in custody pending a scheduled verdict.</p>

<p>Two Gangs of Pirates Hide in Shanghai and Hong Kong, Plotting to Hijack Ships</p>
<p>Various Shipping Companies Actively Establish Anti-Theft Measures</p>
<p>Recently, the Dapeng pirates are again plotting to hijack merchant ships. One gang has already infiltrated Shanghai, and Shanghai shipping companies have begun taking precautions, paying special attention to passengers and cargo. The situation is described in detail below.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Plotting to Hijack Hong Kong-Shanghai Ships <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>In late July, shipping circles in Shanghai received confidential reports that the Dapeng Bay pirates had split into three groups and departed to hijack Nanhua-class ships. This news was soon followed by the Yushun hijacking case. The pirates who hijacked the Yushun have now been apprehended by the Shantou Navy. Recently, this port has received further confidential reports stating that two of the three pirate groups have now been dispatched. One group remains hidden in Hong Kong, plotting to hijack merchant ships in the South China region, while the other group has infiltrated Shanghai, intending to plunder merchant ships sailing to various ports in the North and South Seas. All shipping companies have been ordered to take strict precautions.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Shanghai Ships Increase Security Checks <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai shipping companies, learning from past hijackings like the Yushun, know that pirates often disguise themselves as northern merchants to board the ships. Since the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company in Shanghai implemented passenger screening before boarding, other shipping companies are now following suit to ensure the safety of travelers. Recently, they have taken further steps, requiring all passengers booked via Huangyutou to provide a guarantor. Those without a reliable guarantor or deemed suspicious are not sold tickets. As a result, the safety of sea passengers has been further enhanced.</p>

Recently, various ports have been transporting silver ingots and other valuables into Shanghai.</p>

<p>Before the January 28th Incident, the Traffic Departments of both railways operated at the North Railway Station. After the North Railway Station was destroyed, they temporarily set up simple offices near the Boundary Road Station. Director Zheng Baozhao, seeing that the new site has been completed, ordered his staff yesterday to sort through documents and begin moving into the new site. In addition to most of the Traffic Department Director's office having been moved, the Deputy Director's office will be moved today. Furthermore, the Business and General Affairs Sections offices are also preparing to move in simultaneously today. Station affairs inspectors, the telegraph room, and the China Travel Service also completed their installation yesterday, and it is expected that the complete move will be completed in the next few days.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Organizational Changes <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>At the same time, the Traffic Department will implement organizational changes as ordered by the Ministry. The department's internal structure was originally divided into three sections: Documentation, Dispatching, and Business. The Documentation Section will now be renamed the General Affairs Section, and the original four divisions of Documentation, Personnel, General Affairs, and Archives will be reorganized into three divisions: Literary Affairs, Personnel Affairs, and Administrative Affairs. The original Archives division will be merged into the Literary Affairs division, and the General Affairs division will be renamed Administrative Affairs, in order to coordinate the various links in the general administrative system. The Dispatching Section, which manages railway transport affairs for both lines, will be uniformly referred to as the Transportation Section. To align with the names of other lines, it will be renamed the Transportation Section. The section's original four divisions of Beijing-Shanghai Train Dispatching, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Train Dispatching, Traffic Control, and Traffic Statistics will be reorganized into three divisions: Literary Affairs, Dispatching, and Traffic Control. The Business Section, which manages railway business affairs, will be renamed the Business Section, and the original four divisions of Passenger and Freight, Public Transport, Investigation, and Business Statistics, as well as the Catering Business Office, will be reorganized into six divisions: Literary Affairs, Passenger Transport, Freight Transport, Compilation and Investigation, Public Relations, and Catering. The original Passenger and Freight division and Public Transport division will be merged into the Passenger Transport and Freight Transport divisions, and the Investigation and Business Statistics divisions will be merged into the Compilation and Investigation division. The Traffic Department has already implemented the above measures.</p>

<p>Jiu Yi Hosiery Shop Wholesale Department, located at 1343-136 Rue du Consulat, French Concession, has reportedly been established for seven or eight years. It also has a large-scale factory on Avenue des Soeurs, and its business is very prosperous. However, at 7:25 p.m. last night, just after the employees had finished their dinner, someone suddenly threw a hand grenade from the middle of the road. A loud explosion shook the neighborhood, destroying two large glass windows and two small glass windows on the east side of the shop. Fortunately, all the people inside were standing far away, so no one was injured. The grenade thrower escaped without a trace. The manager of the shop, Wang Liwei, a native of Zhenjiang, reported the incident to the Louza Police Station. The police chief immediately dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to investigate. After inspecting the scene, they collected the remains of the exploded grenade and stored it at the police station pending investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e161">Chairman's Report <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>After formal greetings, Chairman Kong Xiangxi reported, stating briefly: "Today is the day of our China Child Welfare Association's biannual general meeting. The sunshine is so bright, and the weather is so clear, truly enough to inspire our spirit, and to carry out various meaningful and valuable work with an optimistic attitude. Today, I am honored to have all of you enthusiastic comrades, regardless of hardship, take the time to come and participate in the discussion, promote various matters of the Association, and thereby promote the progress of our country. This is truly a happy thing, and it is something I should first of all solemnly thank you comrades on behalf of the Association. Every half year that the China Child Welfare Association goes through, it always has a special atmosphere, so at each biannual general meeting, we cannot help but have special thoughts. In the past six months, the Association has led the country in holding the Second Children's Day, printing and sending approximately 30,000 copies of Children's Day handbooks and other special publications, holding a grand Child Welfare Dance to expand Child Welfare publicity, holding fifteen Children's Protection Lectures, investigating forty-nine cases of child abuse, distributing 10,000 copies of pamphlets advising against child abuse, and adopting one hundred and six helpless children, of whom twenty-five have been entrusted for placement. We have also promoted health knowledge to impoverished families 229 times, sent 4,230 sick children for treatment, assisted in infant health competitions and hygiene campaigns in various locations, and established child welfare groups in the nature of nurseries, housing and caring for thirty infants, providing them with appropriate education. In addition to the above-mentioned routine developments, there are also several special developments, such as (1) proceeding with the establishment of the Beijing Child Welfare Association, which is nearing completion; (2) petitioning the Legislative Yuan to enact children's laws and establish children's courts; (3) publishing the Modern Parents Monthly, promoting parenting education, which has now been published to Volume 1, Issue 4, with many subscribers and very popular among people in society; (4) specially dispatching Deputy Secretary-General Chen Tiesheng to Beiping to handle relief affairs in the North China war zone, contacting more than fifty agencies and organizations, and serving more than 300,000 displaced women and children; (5) expanding the scope of child welfare groups, hiring more teachers, and establishing infant and toddler sections, increasing the original number of infants cared for from thirty to forty. All of these</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>developments are, on the one hand, due to the efforts of the people of the Association, and on the other hand, rely especially on the sympathy and enthusiastic support of the general public. For several years, due to the Association's continued and constant publicity, the general public has also suddenly realized the importance of child welfare work, cooperating closely with the Association in all aspects. In addition to this, the Chinese publishing industry is now also paying great attention to children's reading materials, striving for perfection. Various valuable daily newspapers have also opened special columns to discuss various issues related to children and parents. In Shanghai, due to the initiative of the Municipal Government's Education Bureau and Social Affairs Bureau, the Children's Welfare Committee has been formally established to plan for the welfare of children throughout the city. The Shanghai Morning Post recently held an Infant Health Competition, a Family Fun Day, and a Family Economics Forum, and has also decided to hold a National Children's Health and Beauty Competition on Double Tenth Day this year. From this, it can be seen that there are now more than just a few of us who know the importance of children's welfare in today's society, and that there are also more than just the China Child Welfare Association who are working hard to promote children's welfare. This is truly a gratifying and congratulatory phenomenon, which can be celebrated for the future of China. (7) Not long ago, I made a trip around the world. In this global recession, the people of all countries (especially the people of Germany, Italy, and Soviet Russia) are all tightening their belts, living frugally, enduring hardship, and regarding the country's pain as their own pain, the country's happiness as their own happiness, forgetting the interests of the individual, and striving for the public society, seeking to break through the current economic difficulties. This kind of spirit of public service and dedication to the country is truly worthy of singing, weeping, sighing, and praising. Looking back at the current situation in our country, what is it like, and what is the spirit shown by the people? Regarding this level, you all know it very clearly, and there is no need for me to say more. I believe that the spirit of the people of Europe and America striving for the public is absolutely not accidental, but is the result of long-term training and the long-term cultivation of family education before it can be successfully cultivated. Therefore, in this era of national destruction, internal and external troubles, I hope that the people of our motherland can shoulder the responsibility of saving the country, shoulder the responsibility of training children, and, regardless of whether they are adults or children, can embrace the goal of sacrificing for the country and strive forward, regarding the country's pain as their own pain, the country's happiness as their own happiness, and use this spirit of serving the public and striving for the public to build a strong China, a progressive China, a modern China, and a China that can hold its head high in the world. That is my greatest hope. The future direction of efforts for the China Child Welfare Association and all those who pay attention to the welfare of children will probably be no more than this." After Kong's report, Secretary-General Xu Jianping reported on the association's affairs, and accountant Lin Kanghou reported on the financial situation.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Mayor's Admonition <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Mayor Wu Tiecheng gave an admonitory speech, stating briefly, "Child welfare is the basic work of saving the country, and the life-sustaining medicine for the revival of the nation. Today's China must rest and recuperate, teach and train, and endure hardship before it can achieve prosperity. From the perspective of the great history of our Chinese nation in the past, if the people of the whole country can recognize the importance of child welfare and work together to train today's children to be healthy citizens in the future, then the great revival of the nation can be expected soon. I hope that the Child Welfare Association will always adhere to this purpose and work hard to do it, then the future of the Republic of China and the future of the Child Welfare Association are both immeasurable."</p>
<h3 id="e163">Passed Proposals <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>

<h3 id="e166">Pitiful Prostitute Dies from Abortion <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>At approximately 3 AM yesterday morning, in front of the Guangren Hospital on Avenue Edward VII, a Suzhou woman, Chen Gao, residing at No. 275 North Jiangxi Road, accompanied a 19-year-old Suzhou girl, Chen Danaan, to the hospital, claiming the girl was injured in her lower body due to an abortion and requesting treatment. After examination by the doctor, it was found that Chen's vulva was swollen, inflamed, and necrotic. A surgical procedure was performed, and a pig bone, approximately five inches long and covered in blood, was extracted from the vulva. The girl cried out in extreme pain and was in a dying state.</p>
<p>She lingered until 11:30 AM the following day, when she breathed her last and returned to the underworld. The hospital notified the Hongkou Police Station, which dispatched Detective Zhang Desheng to investigate. The girl's body was taken to the coroner's office on Fielun Road. Chen Gao was arrested and, yesterday morning, was escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Judge Wu Ze questioned her. Lawyer Zhang Tianyin of the police station stated that after investigation, the defendant operated a brothel and bought the girl for 270 yuan to engage in prostitution. As a result, she became pregnant after receiving clients for many months. This pregnancy was an impediment to receiving clients and going to parties. Therefore, a week ago, she asked someone to perform an abortion, inserting a five-inch pig bone into her lower body to cause the fetus to rot into blood. The abortionist's skills were poor, causing internal damage. The pig bone was sucked in and could not be removed, gradually leading to a dangerous condition. That is why she was sent to the hospital for treatment. However, the illness was too advanced, and although the doctor removed the pig bone, it was impossible to save her. He requested a lawful inquiry. Questioned by Judge Wu, Chen Gao stated she lived in the kitchen of the premises and had previously worked as a maid for a Mr. So-and-so on Wuchang Road for a monthly salary of six yuan, quitting after only twenty days. Chen Danaan was her younger sister, living on the mezzanine of No. 293 Wuchang Road. Her parents were deceased, and she was not yet married. On the evening of the 21st, Chen Danaan and a certain woman came to her house, asking her to perform an abortion. However, seeing the girl frequently complaining of abdominal pain, she realized it was caused by an abortion injury. She denied operating a brothel. Judge Wu ordered her to be remanded in custody for further investigation at a later date. At 11:00 AM, the Special Court commissioned Prosecutor Diao Chengtang to go to the coroner's office with a forensic doctor. They confirmed that the deceased girl, Chen Danaan, had died from an abortion. The body was handed over to her cousin, Li Arong, who signed a statement for the coffin and burial.</p>

<h3 id="e169">Record of Gao Lansheng Case Trial <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>| Rescheduled to September 7th |</p>
<p>Gao Lansheng (aka Gao Agen) of Hangxian County, Zhejiang Province, was arrested on the 23rd of last month by French police detective Rao Puzhe at the Cangzhou Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road, along with his accomplice, Sun Qihai of Chuansha, and brought back to the police station. They were sent to the Second District Court for investigation and detention, as reported in previous newspapers. Subsequently, Xu Changrong, who was related to Gao, was transferred from the First Special District Court to the case and sent to the court to await a joint trial. Yesterday was the scheduled trial date. The defense lawyers hired by the defendants, Wang Shizong, Jiang Yiping, Zhu Dianqing, Ge Zhitan, Wu Linkun, Xu Yannian, Jiang Baoqian, and others, arrived at the court to await instructions. At 11:00 AM, Judge Zhang Chaozuo and Clerk Xu Chenghuang took their seats in the First Court. After first hearing three cases related to the Red Pill Hall brought by the police, the Gao case was heard. Court police escorted the three defendants to stand in the defendant's box. Lawyer Wang Shizong stated that he had initially been appointed by the first defendant, Gao Lansheng, but now requested to withdraw his appointment and serve as the defense lawyer for the second defendant, Sun Qihai. Lawyer Wu Linkun also requested to withdraw his appointment as the second defendant Sun Qihai's lawyer and serve as the first defendant Gao Lansheng's lawyer. Jiang Baoqian also requested to withdraw his appointment as Sun Qihai's defense lawyer. The judge then questioned Gao Lansheng, who stated he was 32 years old, formerly residing at No. 4 Sande Lane on Saipo Sai Road, and had moved to No. 16 Mingde Lane ten days ago after being stabbed. He then questioned Sun Qihai, who stated he was 30 years old, residing at No. 8 Xiafei Lane on Beihai Road, and sometimes went to Guangde, living in the coal mine. Finally, he questioned Xu Changrong, who stated he was 32 years old, residing at No. 423 Tangjiawan, and ran a rice store on Zhao Zhou Road. After the questioning, Police Lawyer Yao Zhaodi stood up and presented the case, stating that the police investigation revealed four counts of criminal activity against the first defendant, Gao Lansheng: Firstly, regarding the defendant's involvement in the murder case with Chang Lao Jiu in the Chinese area, the Shanghai District Court had accepted the case and requested the court's assistance in issuing an arrest warrant. The police were now dropping this charge. Secondly, regarding the gambling case, investigation revealed that the defendant was the leader of a flower club, and he was now being charged under Article 280 of the Criminal Law. Thirdly, regarding the sale of opium substitutes, the police had previously uncovered a red pill manufacturing operation at No. 12, Lane 465 Fuchu Road, and arrested Pan Shiyou and others. They confessed that the defendant had opened it. Since Pan and others were involved in a case in the International Settlement, the Supreme Court ruled that the First Special District Court should try the case. He was now being charged under Article 6 of the Anti-Smoking Law. Fourthly, regarding bribery of the police, it was discovered that the defendant had bribed police officers while operating the flower club. The police had suspended the bribed officers. He was now being charged under Article 128, Section 1 of the Criminal Law, and a letter from Wang Tingyu found in the defendant's house was presented as evidence. He also stated that the second defendant, Sun Qihai, was arrested along with the first defendant and found to be jointly operating the flower club with the first defendant. He was now being charged under Article 280 of the Criminal Law. The third defendant, Xu Changrong, had evidence of a flower club found in the Anle Third Hotel, and Zhang Deqing and others were arrested. They confessed that Xu was involved with the flower club, and he was now being charged under Article 280 of the Criminal Law. He requested a lawful trial. The judge asked Gao Lansheng if he understood what the police lawyer had said. He answered that he did. The judge asked, "Did you commit murder in the Chinese area?" He answered, "No." The judge asked, "When did the flower club start?" He answered, "In June last year, Mao Axiang came to me and invested 100 yuan. Wu Shuangfu was also involved, but I don't know anyone else." The judge asked, "When did you stop doing it?" He answered, "In August. I went to Hankou in mid-December and came back at the end of March this year. I went again after about a month." The judge asked, "Did you open the red pill manufacturing operation at No. 12, Lane 645 Fuchu Road?" He answered, "No. I don't know the people who were arrested." The judge asked, "Did you bribe police officers when you were running the flower club?" He answered, "I don't know." The judge asked, "What did you do in the flower club?" He answered, "I only had a small share. I didn't do anything." The judge asked, "Who was the manager?" He answered, "I don't know." The judge asked, "Do you know that the Shanghai District Court is issuing an arrest warrant for you for the murder case?" He answered, "No." The judge asked, "Who is Wang Tingyu?" He answered, "He is a friend who is a compradore selling Chinese ships." The judge asked, "What did Wang Tingyu write to you about?" He answered, "He asked me to buy a rubber tire for a car." The judge gave him the letter to read and asked him to explain its meaning. Gao took the letter and answered, "I can't read. I can't even write my own name. I don't know what the letter means." The judge asked, "Who else was in the flower club?" He answered, "I only know Mao Axiang. I don't know anyone else." The judge ordered the defendants Xu to be removed and asked, "Who is Sun Qihai?" He answered, "A friend." The judge asked, "What does Sun do at your place?" He answered, "He's not at my place. He works in the coal mine." The judge asked, "What does Xu Changrong do?" He answered, "He is a friend. I heard that he is involved in the flower club from Mao Axiang." The judge ordered Gao to be removed and called Sun Qihai to the stand. The judge asked, "What is your relationship with Gao Lansheng?" He answered, "A friend. I work in the coal mine." The judge asked, "When did you meet Gao?" He answered, "In June this year, I went to Gao's house to ask for a share." The judge then read Sun Qihai's confession from the police station admitting to running the flower club and asked if it was correct. He answered, "I didn't say that at the police station." The judge ordered Xu Changrong to the stand. The judge asked, "Do you know Gao Lansheng?" He answered, "Yes, a friend. I met him on the boat from Hankou to Shanghai in March this year. Zhang Deqing introduced Gao to eat rice at my store. He asked me to send money to the bank." The judge asked, "What did you do for Gao when he was running the flower club?" He answered, "I didn't do anything in the flower club." The judge asked, "Do you know what Gao does?" He answered, "I know he does rubber business." The judge asked, "You confessed to running the flower club at the police station?" He answered, "The police asked me to confess based on Zhang Deqing's confession." The judge asked, "What was the 2,686 yuan for?" He answered, "Gao Lansheng asked me to send it to the bank." The judge asked, "Did you continue to send money to the bank for him?" He answered, "I knew he was running the flower club on May 12th, so I broke off contact with him." The judge asked, "You were the bookkeeper in the flower club. How much salary did you get?" He answered, "None. There was no salary." The judge asked, "Do you know Mao Axiang and Wu Shuangfu?" He answered, "I only know their names. I don't know them." The judge called Gao to the stand again. The judge asked, "How much money did Xu Changrong earn in the flower club?" He answered, "Although I have shares, I don't care about the internal affairs." The judge asked, "Did you ask Xu Changrong to send money to the bank?" He answered, "No." The judge asked Xu again, "What did you mean when you said Gao asked you to send money to the bank?" Xu answered, "It was delivered by Gao's clerk. Gao himself is hard to meet." The questioning ended there, as it was already past noon. The judge stated that the case files were not fully collected and the debate could not be opened. The lawyers hired by the defendants requested that the defendants be allowed to post bail pending questioning, but the court did not approve. He then announced that the trial would be rescheduled to September 7th and the defendants were remanded in custody.</p>

Since its opening, passengers have found its pricing extremely cheap (one yuan per trip) and its speed fast. Those coming out of the Nanjing Grand Theater, the Circus, or the Great World can take a car from this branch to go home most easily. Therefore, in recent days, the crowding of passengers has created a situation of great demand.</p>
<p>Huazheng Factory Receives Multiple Super Awards: The electric fans, generators, and square-panel electric boards produced by the Huasheng Electrical Appliance Manufacturing Factory in this city are famous at home and abroad and have a good reputation. Over the years, the factory has participated in domestic and foreign exhibitions, and its products have been praised by Chinese and foreign people. The Chinese and foreign governments have awarded the factory no less than forty or fifty kinds of awards. Recently, at the Railway Ministry's Exhibition of Goods Along the Route and the Third National Products Exhibition of Zhejiang Province, the factory was requisitioned for display. The Ministry of Railways and the Construction Department of Zhejiang Province specifically awarded super-class awards to encourage it.</p>
<p>New Building Completed for Shanghai Bulb Company Glass Factory: The Shanghai Bulb Company previously felt that the glass factory's houses and stoves were insufficient for development, so the board of directors decided to add two large factory buildings and two stoves. The Central Construction Factory undertook the construction last month. By now, one month has passed, and all the projects have been completely completed. The stoves are currently being built quickly and should be completed soon. It is heard that the factory can produce 15,000 light bulbs per day.</p>
<p>Large-Scale National Cosmetics Company to be Established in This City: Mr. Chen Jianming, who once lived a military life, saw that foreign insults have been pressing on in recent years, and domestic industries have been declining and collapsing. The fact that cosmetics and daily necessities rely heavily on foreign imports, causing the outflow of money to reach tens of millions of yuan per year, is heartbreaking. In view of this, Mr. Chen left his gun and came to implement national salvation through production. He raised huge sums of money to establish the Jinlang National Cosmetics Company on Lauerdong Road in this city. He hired well-known domestic technicians to manufacture various cosmetics and daily necessities using chemical methods, in order to slightly save the drain. It is known that many dignitaries of the National Government have given inscriptions to promote it. It is also heard that the company's internal preparations have been largely completed, and the products will be available to people from all walks of life around the time of the osmanthus fragrance.</p>
<p>The West Branch of the Meili Flower Paper Company Opens Today: The Meili Flower Paper Company at No. 306 Nanjing Road in this city specializes in selling wallpaper from major European and American manufacturers. The quality and color are excellent, and the prices and services are especially low and considerate, so it has been well received by society. The company has established a west branch at No. 641 Nanjing Road (that is, the entrance of Daqingli) today in view of its business development and to facilitate customers. The newest colors have been extensively collected. Welcome to visit.</p>
<p>The Quality of Cishi Realgar is Excellent: Realgar, also known as chicken crest stone and potassium sulfide, is a special product of Cili and Shimen counties in Hunan Province. It is one of the world's famous minerals with many uses. It has strong bactericidal and disinfectant properties. However, the quality of the products sold on the market has been very poor in recent years. This year, the Cishi Realgar Bureau is mining and producing exquisite products, which have been shipped to Han in large quantities. The Han口Commodity Inspection Bureau has verified that the potassium sulfide content ranges from 58% to 82%, with a license as proof. In order to promote sales, the Yunlong Company of Han口is the sole agent, and the prices are unified. The goods are also very authentic, which is very different from the products sold on the market in the past.</p>

<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>Although I have wide social interactions on weekdays, I do not send elegiac couplets for those I do not know or those I know but do not attend the funeral. In the past few years, there have been cases of forged elegiac couplets in my name, published in newspapers, such as the deaths of Soong Tzu-wen's mother and Tan Yankai a few years ago, and Yang Quan this year. I did not send any elegiac couplets, but there were forgeries circulating, confusing public opinion. As for works satirizing current affairs, although I sometimes write them, they are mostly in poetry, and they must be elegant. However, the forgeries are mostly vulgar and absurd. I hope that in the future, all newspapers, large and small, must see my handwriting before publishing my elegiac couplets and poems, so that the authenticity can be distinguished, and others cannot make insinuations.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Zhang Binglin</p>

<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>The news item published in your newspaper on August 28 regarding the resumption of the market closure in Luodian does not entirely match the facts at the time. I am now writing to request a correction:</p>
<p>1. The two committee members, Liu Shouquan and Chen Jiamo, were representatives sent by the Baoshan County Party Department to Luodian to deal with the market closure incident and were not appointed by County Magistrate Jin.</p>
<p>2. Sun Yingfeng is the executive committee member of the First Direct District Branch of the Baoshan County Party Department. He attended as a representative of the branch on that day and was not a staff member of the branch.</p>
<p>3. In the news, there is a passage: "As for Sun Yingfeng, who has been instigating trouble, considering his father's sentiments, no further discussion will be held." The committee members did not mention this comment that day. It is clear that the reporting is inaccurate and should be corrected.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Director Zhou of the Jiangsu Education Department, in view of the fact that the education in Liyang, this province, has had frequent disputes for many years and has not been able to get on the right track, and that one or two troublemakers in the education sector have been implementing various sabotage plans, will be irreparable if they are not reorganized. It has been decided to select Gui Yinwu, the education director of Peixian, a capable and talented person among the education directors of this province, and propose to the provincial government to transfer him to fill the position of education director of the county, and order him to carry out the intentions of the department's reorganization and work hard to advance. At the same time, County Magistrate Bi of Liyang was summoned to the province to be instructed to assist the new director Gui in implementing the progress. It is heard that there were also major educational disputes in Peixian in the past. Since Director Gui took office, it has gradually been on the right track. It is thought that the education in Liyang will also be able to follow in the footsteps of Peixian and move towards the right path after this measure by the Education Department.</p>

<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education conducted an examination at the National Chiao Tung University in Shanghai for publicly funded students to study in Europe and America. Examination committee members thoroughly reviewed all subject papers, calculated scores, and unsealed the anonymized papers. A total of seven candidates took the Mechanical Engineering exam, twenty-one for Civil Engineering. One of the Civil Engineering candidates, Zhao Suizhang, did not complete all specialized subject exams due to physical condition issues, so twenty were actually scored. Three candidates took the Chemical Engineering exam. It is reported that among all subjects, Qian Zhonghan, who took the Mechanical Engineering exam, achieved the highest overall score. Qian is from Wuxi and a graduate of the Electrical Engineering Department of Chiao Tung University. He is highly regarded by teachers and friends at the university and has consistently ranked first in academics and conduct each semester, receiving tuition waivers. The second-highest score was Shen Yixian, a graduate of the University of Hong Kong and currently the Director of Academic Affairs at Shanghai High School. His performance was also exceptional in this examination for educational institution personnel studying abroad. The third-highest score was Li Guozhu, currently teaching at the University of Shanghai. He previously studied in the United States at his own expense and earned a Master's degree in Chemistry from the University of Michigan. This year, he is going to the United States again to study Chemical Engineering and thus has a particular strength in Chemistry subjects. There were many applicants for the Civil Engineering subject, but none achieved outstanding results. The list of admitted students is as follows: Qian Zhonghan, Shen Yixian, Li Guozhu, Zeng Runchen, Shi Zhongqi, Zhang Yousheng, Ye Xuean, Huang Wanli, Zhu Baohua, Zhu Guoxi.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Du Dingyou and Others Propose Establishing a Central Library School <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>Requesting the Government to Allocate a Portion of the Cotton and Wheat Loan</p>
<p>To be Used as School Foundation and Operating Expenses</p>
<p>丨Proposed at the Library Association Annual Meeting丨</p>
<p>The second annual meeting of the Chinese Library Association was held at Tsinghua University in Beiping from the 28th to the 31st of last month. Members from the Beijing and Shanghai areas, including Du Dingyou, Liu Guojun, and Qian Cunxun, traveled to Beiping to participate and proposed the establishment of a Central Library School. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Main Proposal: The Association recommends to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Education that a portion of the Cotton and Wheat Loan be allocated to establish a Central Library Specialized School in the capital.</p>
<p>Reasons: (1) The government has declared that the Cotton and Wheat Loan will be used for construction. Among construction projects, the most important is to improve the people's knowledge and increase their productive capacity. Libraries are the most effective and economical institutions for promoting and improving the people's knowledge. Therefore, a portion of the Cotton and Wheat Loan should be used for the expenses of running a library specialized school. (2) The library profession is increasingly developing, and there is a shortage of specialized personnel. There is only one library specialized school in the country, the private Boone Library School in Wuchang, which is inconvenient. To promote the library profession, it is necessary to train more specialized personnel. (3) Many provinces, cities, and counties have libraries, but their effectiveness has not been significant, largely due to financial limitations, but also due to the lack of suitable talent. To increase library efficiency, it is necessary to establish more library specialized schools. (4) The capital is the center of national attention, the source of government orders, and the location of many universities, gradually becoming the national cultural center. It is appropriate to concentrate national efforts to promote culture to seek development. Libraries are the most important institutions for promoting culture. Therefore, establishing a library specialized school in the capital is most appropriate. (5) The most important way to promote national construction is to restore the rural economy. Rural construction relies heavily on farmer education. Libraries and farmer education are closely related. Therefore, it is advisable to train more specialized library personnel to promote farmer libraries.</p>
<p>Measures: (1) The Association shall separately submit the proposal to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Education and hire experts to organize a Central Library Specialized School Committee to formulate a plan for implementation. (2) A portion of the Cotton and Wheat Loan shall be allocated as the school's foundation and operating expenses. (3) The library specialized school should be established in the capital at the outset to coordinate everything, and then be established in other major cities. Proposers: Du Dingyou, He Rizhang, Liu Guojun, Li Yanting, Liu Chunfu, Qian Cunxun, Wu Ziping.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Official Documents Adopt Simplified Punctuation <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>All Agencies to Implement Starting Today</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education issued an order to its affiliated agencies stating: Regarding the Ministry of Education's Order No. 7539, for compliance; regarding the Executive Yuan's Order No. 3510, upon review, the Executive Yuan passed the adoption of simplified punctuation in official documents at its 114th and 117th meetings. All ministries and commissions shall implement starting August 1st, and affiliated agencies of all ministries and commissions shall implement starting September 1st. The record has been made and notified, and the implementation should be carried out on schedule. In addition to separate orders, the relevant measures are copied and issued for compliance and for onward transmission to subordinate units for compliance. Therefore, we are issuing this order along with a copy of the original attachment for compliance and for onward transmission to subordinate units for compliance. We are now attaching its measures as follows: (1) The following punctuation marks shall be used temporarily. It is hoped that the various symbols stipulated in the Ministry of Education's unified official document format for educational institutions will be gradually adopted in the future, including commas, periods, quotation marks, reiteration quotation marks, ellipsis points, proper noun marks, and parentheses, etc. (2) Official documents should be divided into paragraphs according to the meaning of the text. The paragraphing and the writing of quoted original text shall be in accordance with the style stipulated in the Ministry of Education's unified official document format for educational institutions, but the use of symbols is temporarily limited to the above seven types. (3) The terminology used in official documents shall fully adopt the regulations in the Ministry of Education's unified official document format for educational institutions.</p>

<h3 id="e187">This Year's Improvement Plan for Shanghai College of Law and Politics <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>Dean Zhang Zhongdao's Statement</p>
<p>Regarding the recent real situation of the Shanghai College of Law and Politics and its improvement plan for this year, Dean Zhang Zhongdao issued the following statement yesterday: Our college was founded in the 13th year of the Republic (1924) and was originally named Shanghai College of Law and Politics. Since the 19th year of the Republic (1930), after being registered with the Ministry of Education and specially licensed by the Ministry of Justice, the Board of Directors and the school authorities have been diligently working to develop the school's affairs. By today, the scale has gradually taken shape, making it one of the famous institutions of higher learning in Shanghai. Over the past ten years, the total number of graduates from our college</p>
<p>exceeds five thousand people. In the first session of the Higher Civil Service Examination and the first, second, and third sessions of the Judges' Examination, graduates of our college have been selected in each session, numbering about ten people. The number of those selected for the Assessor Qualification Examination is even too numerous to count. Many are serving in the judicial, political, and educational circles domestically and practicing law in various places. Taking Shanghai as an example, in addition to the prosecutors serving in the courts, there are nearly one hundred practicing lawyers. Thus, the contribution of our college in cultivating political and legal talents to the nation and society is not insignificant.</p>
<p>Regarding the debt issue of our college, the outside world is largely unaware of the truth, leading to many rumors. Upon investigation, the only substantiated debt is the advance payment from the construction company Liu Yinsheng, which was resolved through mutual reconciliation in the Shanghai Second Special District Court last year. It was agreed that the college would repay Liu Yinsheng 19,800 taels, with an initial payment of 7,000 yuan made at the end of last year, and the remainder to be paid in three years.</p>
<p>One-sixth of the remaining sum would be paid each year in late June and late December. The first installment of over 3,000 yuan has already been duly paid by the college. In addition, although one or two self-proclaimed creditors have filed lawsuits with the court, they all lack sufficient evidence and their motives are suspicious. To safeguard legal interests, the college can hardly acknowledge them. As for facilities, the most important is the library. Since 1930, our college has added new books to its collection every year, totaling over six or seven thousand yuan annually. In addition to the donations from Board Member Wang Chonghui and the political and legal masterpieces purchased by Dean Zheng from Europe, the total number of Chinese and Western books, including existing ones, exceeds twenty thousand volumes (excluding magazine subscriptions). For an independent college, the collection of books can already be considered considerable. Currently, in addition to using the library fees paid by students to purchase new books, we also plan to raise substantial funds separately to extensively collect and enrich this treasure trove of knowledge.</p>
<p>The second issue is the school building. In recent years, the original school building has become insufficient to accommodate the increasing number of students. Its location near the market is unsuitable for education. Therefore, finding a suitable location to build a new school building is an urgent matter. The Board</p>
<p>of Directors, in view of this, entrusted Yan Shenyu, the Shanghai County Magistrate, this spring to purchase over ninety mu of land in the Beiqiao town area. The Board of Directors has resolved to raise funds for construction and has engaged architect Li Zikan to undertake the design and construction. It is currently in active progress. It is expected that the</p>
<p>new school building can be completed by the end of this year.</p>
<p>Furthermore, regarding academic affairs, in the past, the salaries of full-time faculty members were up to 200 yuan per month, and the hourly wage for part-time faculty was</p>
<p>around 4 yuan. However, full-time faculty members taught a maximum of ten hours per week and were paid for twelve months of the year. Compared to other private universities, the treatment of professors was indeed more than adequate. This academic year, the salaries of faculty members have been further increased. The salaries of full-time professors have increased to over 300 yuan. The total amount of professors' salaries accounts for more than 60% of the total school expenditure. At the same time, efforts have been devoted to revising the curriculum, referring to the examination subjects for higher civil servants and the curriculum arrangements of well-known universities at home and abroad, so as to systematize all courses, and to emphasize domestic teaching materials and instill practical knowledge, so as to cultivate practical talents to meet the needs of society.</p>
<p>Upon investigation, last year, the number of students applying to our college was very enthusiastic, with about eight or nine hundred applicants, of whom about three hundred were admitted. If it were not for the daily reputation of the school, which was able to gain the trust of the general public, how could it have reached this point? Just as the first round of recruitment for this academic year was completed, an order was suddenly received from the Ministry to suspend recruitment. Those who do not know the actual situation of our college may not be without conjecture, resulting in</p>
<p>other misunderstandings. In fact, this temporary suspension of enrollment not only does not harm the future of our college, but also strengthens the determination of the college authorities and promotes the cooperation of seven or eight hundred teachers and students in the whole school. We think that the Ministry of Education will certainly provide assistance to schools that are willing to take responsibility for improvement in the future.</p>
<p>In short, no matter what the environment, our college will adhere to its original intention and work tirelessly. In the shortest possible time, we will strive to achieve balanced progress in both spirit and material aspects. We hope that all sectors of society and wise individuals at home and abroad will give us support in terms of opinions or substance. Then the future of education will be fortunate.</p>

<p>The Chinese Women's Physical Education Teachers College on Route Pichon in the French Concession has already opened on August 26th and is scheduled to officially begin classes on September 1st. Recently, new and old students have been registering enthusiastically. The original dormitory is insufficient for use, and plans for expansion are actively underway. It is reported that the school has hired German physical education expert Dr. Sternberg and well-known Shanghai physical education figures such as Shu Hong as professors this semester. The other professors in various subjects are also famous figures in the field of physical education both domestically and abroad. The school emphasizes a broad curriculum and strict discipline. It is reported that there are still vacancies in each grade. Those interested in physical education are strongly encouraged to register quickly.</p>

<p>Qian Qinglian, courtesy name Shoubo, is from Kunshan, Jiangsu. In 1931, he graduated from the School of Law of Soochow University with a Bachelor of Laws degree. Due to his outstanding academic performance, he was selected as a member of the Phi Tau Phi Scholastic Honor Society of America. Subsequently, he passed the first Higher Civil Service Examination and was assigned to the Ministry of Communications, where he was substantively appointed as a recommending-rank technician. This time, the Board of Trustees for the Administration of the British Boxer Indemnity Funds selected students to study in England at public expense. As a result, eight candidates passed the exam, and Qian passed with the highest score in law. It is reported that he will set sail for England on September 5th to study law at the graduate school of Oxford or London University.</p>

<p>The South City Elementary School on Xundao Street, Dadongmen, South City, held its opening ceremony the day before yesterday, with due ceremony.

This semester, the school also opened a playground and added sports equipment for children, such as basketball hoops, ping pong tables, and seesaws, etc. It is found that the majority of students in this school are from poor families. Principal Song, out of enthusiasm for education, has to subsidize hundreds of yuan each semester. It is also heard that there are few vacancies in each grade of the school, but the attached commercial night school still has vacancies in each class. Those who are free at night and interested in studying are requested to register at the school as soon as possible to avoid missing the opportunity.</p>

<h3 id="e195">Sino-American Cup Closing Game Postponed <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>The Sino-American Cup tournament brought by the Hong Kong Oriental Association has been underway for a week. Tonight (the 31st) was originally the closing game, with the Guangdong team facing the Post Office A team. The venue was originally scheduled to be the Central Auditorium. However, it is heard that the Jingwu Association needs to reclaim the venue for its own use on that day. Therefore, the Table Tennis Association has announced that the closing will be postponed.</p>
<h3 id="e196">Chinese Walking Association Resolves to Postpone Public Walking Race <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>Rescheduled to October 29th</p>
<p>The Chinese Walking Association held a committee meeting yesterday (August 30th) at 6:15 PM at Moore Memorial Church. Committee members Shi Youhui, Shi Jinsheng, Zhang Zaocai (representing Zhang Zaojiu), Zhang Zaojiu, and Lu Yutian were present, as well as Wang Zhaoxiang, Zhang Zhihe, Cheng Xuan, Yao Yaying, and enthusiastic walking enthusiast Aijieke. The following resolutions were made:</p>
<p>(1) The previously scheduled public men's and women's races on September 24th are now postponed due to the limited time, the National Games has not yet responded, and the many sports events being held in the city make it difficult to pay attention to the walking races. Furthermore, most of the female participants are students, and they will only begin practicing after school starts, leaving little time. It is certain that they will not achieve good results. Therefore, it is specially rescheduled to October 29th.</p>
<p>(2) The first step for the 50,000-meter race is 13 miles. Practice will begin in September. Members who wish to join the training can register with Lu Yutian at the association. The time is from 5:00 PM to 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>(3) The solicitation for entries that began in June has not yielded impressive results. It has now been decided that the committee will be responsible for continuing the process. The best performer will be awarded a silver cup as encouragement.</p>
<p>(4) Recently, walking and long-distance running athletes have been practicing in busy streets, which obstructs traffic and poses a risk to themselves. The Shanghai Municipal Council Police has notified the association about this. In the future, athletes should walk on quieter roads to avoid danger and facilitate traffic. The association has already notified the team captains and hopes that all athletes will pay attention. It is also reported that Shi Jinsheng, who has won championships in the past, has not fully recovered from boils and carbuncles and is unable to move his arms. As a result, he is willing but unable to help. Our Chinese team may lose a key member in the upcoming International Games.</p>

<p>Open Tennis Advanced Singles</p>
<h3 id="e203">Wang Wenzheng Defeats Collaso to Gain Re-match Qualification <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>Wang Defeats Xudeng in Straight Sets in Preliminary Round</p>
<p>Also Defeats Collaso in Straight Sets in Second Round Yesterday</p>
<p>At 4:30 PM yesterday at the China Tennis Field, there was an important tennis match. The participants were Wang Wenzheng and Collaso, who fought a fierce four-set battle in the Rotary Cup final. This time, they met again on a narrow path, competing for a spot in the Open Tennis Advanced Singles quarter-finals. Wang had to avenge his previous defeat, while Collaso had to maintain his previous victory. Therefore, the competition became increasingly intense and fierce. However, few outsiders knew about this match, so the audience was sparse. In the end, Wang gloriously defeated Collaso in straight sets and entered the quarter-final week, avenging his previous defeat. As for Wang's preliminary round against Xudeng, Wang also won in straight sets. The scores are as follows:</p>
<p>6 | | 4</p>
<p>(Preliminary Round) Wang Wenzheng {6 | | 2} Xudeng</p>
<p>6 | | 1</p>
<p>11 | 9</p>
<p>(Second Round) Wang Wenzheng {6 | | 3} Collaso</p>
<p>6 | | 1</p>
<h3 id="e204">The First Set Was Infinitely Variable <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>The competition in the first set was extremely fierce, and the unpredictability of the situation was unprecedented in this season's competition. It caused the few spectators to be apprehensive and nervous. The diagonal long shots and sharp, daring shots of the two players were admirable. In addition, they were both able to reduce mistakes, making the game more rational. Wang Wenzheng was cautious, using both sides of the boundary as targets, and launched fierce attacks from left and right, creating a superior record of five to two games, thinking that he could secure the first set. However, things did not go as expected. Collaso's sudden rise extinguished Wang Wenzheng's arrogance, resulting in an unexpected situation.</p>
<h3 id="e205">Difficult to Distinguish Equal Opponents <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>After the five to two game, Wang lost his serve, making it five to three. Collaso took the serve, making it five to four. It was still thought that Wang Wenzheng could easily win six to four, and the next game was Wang's serve, so the hope of victory was very strong. However, Wang made two consecutive double faults, 0 | 30, the situation was not good, followed by three out-of-bounds shots, and the fourth shot was also out of bounds. Wang lost the game, making it five to five. Collaso served and won forty to fifteen (3 | 1). Wang was able to regain the game, taking a six to five lead. The difference in the situation between gains and losses cannot be measured. If the previous game could be like this, Wang would have ended it with six to four. It is really incomprehensible.</p>
<h3 id="e206">The Situation is Thought-Provoking <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>After six to five, it was Wang's serve again, but Wang lost the game again (slip four), making it six to six again. At the critical moment, Wang could not take the opportunity to win, and easily lost it. This must be said to be his only weakness. In the next game, Collaso won, and Wang fell behind six to seven, with a sense of giving up all his previous efforts. Fortunately, he got the serve, making it seven to seven. Collaso won again, and Wang fell behind seven to eight again. However, Collaso also failed to take the opportunity to advance. Wang won the game with slip four, making it eight to eight, and then took Collaso's serve, taking the lead over Collaso with nine to eight again. Collaso also took Wang's serve, making it nine to nine. In the following two games, the situation became more moderate, and finally he won with eleven to nine. The fortune and misfortune in between are very thought-provoking.</p>
<h3 id="e207">The Next Two Sets Were Easily Won <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>In the first four games of the second set, each lost their serve, after two to two, after Collaso lost his third serve, Wang suddenly won his own serve, taking a four to two lead, and the hope was about to become a reality again. After Collaso won the third game, he lost two games in a row, and Wang ended with six to one again. In the third set, Wang won four games first, Collaso took back one game, and Wang ended with six to one again. In these two sets, Collaso's performance was greatly reduced, and Wang won very easily. In the quarter-final week, Wang will also meet his old opponent Zheng Zhaojia.</p>

<h3 id="e210">A Brief Overview of Sports in the Philippines by Chen Jinzhi <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>I am the captain of the basketball team of the basketball and track and field expedition team of our school (Nanyang High Commercial School). This time, I traveled to the Philippines and stayed in Manila for more than 25 days. In addition to the competition, I engaged in research. Now I will briefly talk about the sports situation in Manila.</p>
<p>To see whether the sports in a place are developed or not, one should look at the organization of sports associations in that place. Manila has the Philippine Amateur Athletic Federation, which is like the Chinese National Sports Federation in Shanghai. This association is in charge of national sports affairs. Manila also has three major sports associations, which are like the Jiangda Sports Federation in Shanghai. This association is composed of the University of the Philippines, National University, and Santo Tomas University, and is the source of various sports talents in the Philippines. The Manila High School Athletic Association is like the Shanghai Secondary School Athletic Association, and is composed of various middle schools in the Philippines that are famous for sports. Therefore, talents are also emerging in large numbers and have achieved remarkable results. Although the Filipinos are said to have a talent for sports, the Philippine authorities are also very willing to promote them. However, the so-called athletes in the Philippines do not seem to be able to practice hard, probably due to the hot weather. Therefore, there is very little hope for the 10th Far Eastern Games next year. Track and field, swimming, tennis, and baseball seem to be weaker than Japan. Volleyball and football may not be a match for our country. The Filipinos' greatest hope for the championship is only basketball.</p>
<p>In addition to basketball, there is another sport that is most popular and most exciting among Filipinos, which is kicking shuttlecock. People of all ages gather in the streets and alleys, kicking back and forth with their front and rear feet, which makes the audience enjoy it.</p>
<p>The most spirited aspect of Philippine sports is the military drills of various schools. The uniforms are neat, and the discipline is strict, similar to the formal army, unlike our students, who regard military training as child's play.</p>
