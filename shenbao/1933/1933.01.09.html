<h3>時評</h3>
<h3>九三三年如何下</h3>
<p>現階段之經濟恐慌。在現制度之下。其爲空前的。己爲無可置疑之事實。是否爲絶後的。則尙爲疑問。然社會主義之嬰孩。旣因蘇俄治權之確立而呱呱墮地。則社會制度新陳之代謝。實已開其端倪歷史之所昭示於吾人者。則一切時代之演變。一切制度之更迭。舉不能有截然之界限。亦猶之人　之生死參伍錯綜。而决不能冀老者之盡死。於何月。幼者之盡生於何年。惟就大勢而言。則歷史上社會主義時代之開始。自即可謂爲資本主義時代之將次告終。惟其間各個崩潰之方式與時期。乃亦互有差殊耳。　　在商業資本尙未發逹之際。經濟社會之所謂恐慌。爲生產不足之饑荒。因人口之增加。此生產不足之恐慌。乃隨每度恐慌之循環而加厲。因而促成經濟史上之農業手工時代之告終。十九世紀以還。機械發明。資本主義逐漸發逹。舉所有往昔生產不足之恐慌。蕩掃殆盡。然代與者乃有相反的生產過剩之恐慌。此生產過剩之恐慌。因機械發明之日新月異。其過剩之狀態。亦隨每度之循環而加厲。其終將促資本主義時代之死亡。殆爲必然之趨勢。世間一切之制度。舉有其時代之價値。資本主義在農業手工時代告終。物質異常缺乏之際。增進生產。造福社會者。自非淺鮮。其目下衰老動搖之狀態。則因其制度内部之矛盾。已陷於無可調和之絶境。申言之。則爲目下之生產力。已决不能適用目下之分配方法。關於此點。吾人若舉一極端之設例。當可格外了然。此極端之設例。係假定機械之發明。已足以節省一切之人工。則就現制度下之雇傭關係而言。豈非整個之勞動階級。已盡陷於失業。更以現制度下之分配方法而言。豈非整個之勞動階級。將悉淪於凍餒。故當此之時。倘此具有偉大生產力之生產工具。仍任若干私人之私有。則不啻人類在原始時代悉憑天然以爲活之時。而造物者忽出而壟斷一切之天產。壟斷者自必陷於過剩。而一般人自必更陷於飢寒。其不可通。已屬顯然。目下之狀態。自尙不至若此極端設例之甚。然勞動階級所分配之享用。須遠少於其生產所得之結果。則爲資本主義下應有之原則。倘吾人假定目下之生產力。勞動階級每日五小時之工作。已足以供社會之所需。則以目下通常八小時工作制度而言。如欲求工人之免於失業。世間將必須有八分之三之生產過剩。反之。倘欲使生產之免於過剩。世間又必須有八分之三之勞工失業。此中矛盾。非改革目下之分配制度。固决難望其調和。吾人之所以認資本主義之陷於日暮途窮者以此。而一九三三年之世界。或即爲時代劇變之　年也。</p>
<p>在此時代劇變之一九三三年中。中國之變化又如何乎。過去一年間之經騐。已明示吾人以世界恐慌日趨深刻之際。即爲帝國主義向中國侵略加緊之時。强者之恐慌。必求轉嫁於弱者。故一九三三年之中國。其困難苦厄之加重。恐爲無可逃避之事實。吾人之所可引以自慰者。則現制度下一切衝突矛盾之加重。旣爲新時代蒞臨之表徴。則當此去舊更新之一階段中。吾人或可以對於新代時之熱望。末减此當前之痛苦。吾人有更須了然於懷者。則世間一切之快樂。均須於犧牲奮鬥中求之。困難苦厄。即爲新時代降臨之代價。吾人祇須認淸個人不過社會中之一份子。現時代不過歷史中之一階段。則但求社會之能現光明。個人之犧牲。復何足以介意。但求整個歷史之永績向上。則現階段之苦厄。更應處之泰然。世間之最可痛最可憐者。厥爲無意義之犧牲與無價値之苦厄。犧牲之意義已明。苦厄之價値已定。則更應　　以須。謳歌而進。奮起以與侵略之國家作殊。死戰。殖民地與次殖民地之反帝鬥争。旣爲現時代計無所出逼不獲已之一着。則惟有一致與起。肉搏而前。以渡過當前之困厄。使此苦悶之階段。倏忽告終。曙光已見來日方長。願吾國人共勉之。</p>

<h3>法西海軍密約</h3>
<p>法報已披露其端倪</p>
<p>引起西人土之反響</p>
<p>▲國民七日瑪德里電前意大利報纸盛傳之法國與西班牙兩國政府秘密磋商在地中海西岸建設法國海軍根據地一節、刻已由法國報紙披露其端倪、因此已引起西班牙人民方面之反響、西京瑪德里ＡＢＣ及辯論　　轉載法國巴黎米迪報新聞一節、内稱、法國議員麥爾維已啓程赴巴利亞立克島、考察　島有無軍港之地位、以便建築法國海軍根據地云、再則法國報紙復載新聞一段、謂法西間密約確已於去年十月間法前總统赫禮歐氏赴西班牙時成立、其中最重要之一節、爲西班牙將斐洲殖民地利次特沃羅讓給法國、而與法國之旦吉爾海國殖民地作爲交換、此事尤引起西班牙人民之恐慌、辯論報斥之爲卑劣秘密之外交、并謂未得其他列强同意之前、亦甚難成事實云、</p>
<h3>日政局暗潮</h3>
<h3>迫使岡田下台</h3>
<p>大角將繼任海相</p>
<p>▲華聯社八日東京電岡田海相去職、日政府雖公佈因病不堪負重職而自退、然政界方面均認定與政治問題有很大關鍵、所謂政治上之問題有二、㈠海軍部内靑年軍官多　美日戰爭在所不免、爲對付美國大海軍、必須積極改善軍備、建造大量戰鬥艦、而岡田在掠奪豫算中表示不積極、海軍豫算經費已被財部扣减、</p>
<h3>人造日光</h3>

<p>▲哈瓦斯社八日偷敦電據人民報稱、英國學者頃有一極感興趣之發明、即創造一機、可發出與太陽光完全相同之光線、惟其力量并無害處、此項發明已作最後試騐、如行將開放之花、一受此光、則俄傾之間即可完全發放云、</p>
<p>而五一五案兇手之中、海軍方面受懲罰、</p>
<p>又比陸軍較嚴重、由此部内之反對岡田之消極態度愈濃厚、㈡政友會領袖談、謂在六十三屆國會當時、岡田曾負齋籐首相之委托、與政友會要人接洽妥協事項、岡田曾與鳩山文相私定默約、謂齋籐内閣在國會閉幕後、當即下台、政權讓給政友會、但該約至今未見實現、且齋籐又轉變態度、準備頑强把持政權、政友會因之憤岡田之失信、致惹起政友會與政府之衝突愈激烈、故岡田不能不自動去職、以謝政友會云、岡田之辭退原因在此、足見日政局之暗潮正烈、</p>
<p>▲華聯社八日東京電今日下午四時一刻、齋籐首相往訪岡田海相、岡田謂本人因病、故决心去職、推安保大將或大齋⾓大將爲繼任海相、齋籐乃訪軍令部長及東鄕元帥、商定後任海相、聞已决定舉荐大⾓岑生大將爲新海相、明日閣議後舉行就職典禮、按大⾓大將本年五十六歲、明治三十一年任海軍少尉、大正九年任少將、十三年任中將、一九三一年任大將、歷海次·横須賀鎭守府司令長官、第二艦隊司令官、一九三一年十二月任犬養内閣海相、上年五一五兇變、引咎下台、</p>

<h3>楡關逃出難民逹十萬衆</h3>
<p>＝麕集秦皇島難民約六七萬＝</p>
<p>＝僞國在楡組設縣政維持會＝</p>
<p>＝敵軍在石河東岸以待增援＝</p>
<p>天津通訊、臨楡縣城失陷後、城内外大火、燃燒三日三夜、直至五日下午始行熄滅、殘垣焦土、不忍目覩、據逃津難民談稱、由楡關逃出者不下十萬人、刻在秦皇島候車者、猶有六七萬人、路局備車一列、每日運送一次、僅能載十千人、最初逃者、均係富有及小康之家、迨至楡城失陷後、日軍藉口掃淸戰塲、挨户搜查、浪人流氓、從而助虐、祇要昔日與人有睚眦之　者、如有仇者暗向日軍報告、某人係中國軍隊間諜、立即被捕槍殺、靑年學生、尤遭日軍仇視、死於非命者、不可勝數、靑年婦女、罔不被强姦或輪姦、家有値錢物件及食糧、悉被搶走、因此一般窮人、不欲逃者、亦不能不逃矣、但出城時、須經過日軍兩道防線、又受兩次搜查、如携有衣物銀錢者、即有浪人尾隨其後、行至中途、即以手槍或電刀威嚇、將財物搶走、所以目下麕集秦皇島之六七萬人、無衣無食無家可歸無親可投者、當有三四萬人、平津當局、因無欵救濟、亦不敢使此大批難民到臨、以添地方隱憂、然而平津兩地之解甲軍閥下野政客、從前敲吸民脂民膏積資百萬以上者、何止五百人、現均藏頭曳尾、過其花天酒地生活、不但對於國難一毛不拔、即對此數萬災黎、亦無動於衷、寗不大可哀耶、</p>
<p>僞國已派員到臨楡縣、聯合地方劣紳地痞、組織縣政臨時維持會、遍貼歡迎日軍及僞軍之標語、並佈告令人民懸掛日旗及僞旗、否則以叛逆罪處死、殊不知殘留於楡城者、皆係老弱不能生產之赤貧、安有餘錢購製旗幟、即使有錢、而商店不燬於火亦被搶空、寸　尺布、亦無買處、故惟有聽敵人宰割耳、</p>
<p>當日軍於元旦挑釁時、第九旅長何柱國受命回防、尙有不准抵抗之令、所以何氏昨在秦皇島發表談話、異常沉痛、其中有云、「不戰不和不守不走、苦心後人自知」、楡關旣失、平津震騖、欲不抵抗、勢已不能、於是調兵遣將、怱遽佈置、連日過津兵車、士氣甚旺、於以知一年來全國唾駡不抵抗者、眞使東北軍健兒含冤負屈矣、孫殿英龐炳勳商震等將領亦有激昂慷慨之表示、至日本方面、聞駐津日軍司令中村孝太郎、已接日本陸軍省電令、對於楡關事件、妥爲應付、毌使擴大、</p>
<p>自四日起、敵軍止於石河東岸、並未積極西進、似呈休戰狀態、忖其原因、㈠希望我軍事當局無條件讓與楡關、如能作到、即進兵攻取熱河、㈡秦皇島有開　礦局、物質建設極多、開　拒絶陸戰隊登岸、兵艦旣不能開砲、飛機亦不能擲彈、徒以短槍小銃進攻、審多利少、㈢遼西救國軍義勇軍尙未撲滅、若冐昧深入、一旦後路截斷、損失殊大、有此種種原因、故有缓和手段與我週旋、藉以遷延時日、以待增援部隊、集中完畢、如果國際空氣不十分惡劣、再對我採取强硬手段、</p>
<p>至於本市尙稱安謐、惟人心驚恐、市面蕭條、每晚十時以後、即呈路寂人稀之象、日租界已將中日交界各胡同口鐵門加鎖並加電網、日領館及日兵營附近、均堆沙袋、復購大批蔴袋鐵絲、旅津白俄百餘人、已被敵方收買、令其指揮便衣隊、備作將來搗亂之用、頃聞熊希齡等發起平津民衆自衛會、聯合銀行商會銀業工會等團體、作健全有力之組織、宗旨在免除平津發生戰事、熊氏今午抵津、向各界接洽矣、（一月六日）</p>
<h3>熱河邊境形勢益緊</h3>
<p>＝調榆日軍折回朝陽＝</p>
<p>＝開魯村莊被日焚燬＝</p>
<p>北平通信、熱河省主席湯玉麟、昨（五日）有電話來報告、楡關事起時、由熱邊調赴山海關之日軍第六八兩師團、三日起已陸續全數折回凌南朝陽縣境、朝陽縣近日雖未發生極大接觸、然日軍𥞊馬厲兵、連夜趕築防禦工程、日機二架、五日下午一時、飛往朝陽凌源、經承德至開魯、低飛偵察、并未發生其他動作、開魯崔旅長、四日電告湯玉麟報告、該縣義軍馮占海一部、在王家油房用高射砲擊下日機一架、日方因是愈憤、除與義軍馮部激戰外、并在開魯附近村莊、用油加茅柴放火、我軍開魯陣線、尙未移動、</p>
<p>朝陽寺來人談、熱河自衛軍張小山部、已退駐囗囗營子一帶、日軍連日以重砲向囗囗營子轟擊、義軍均藏於深谷中、重砲殊少效力、鄕民檢得重砲子頭、計重四斤十三兩、其砲力之猛、可以想見、</p>
<p>昨晨來平之熱省府某要人、談稱、日軍主力部隊、現只逹朝陽寺、外傳日軍已進佔朝陽者、即此之談、查朝陽寺距朝陽、尙有一百七十餘里、其中尙隔有北票重鎭、我各地駐軍防務、極爲鞏固、按入熱要道、必須經過朝陽迤西之葉柏手地方、該處大設奇險、一人當關、萬夫不敵、如有機關槍數架、即使敵來數千、亦難生還、更兼開魯北方绥東一帶、百沙成山、其高逾於平市之景山、綿亘逹於黑龍江、沙質鬆軟、單人行經其上、雙足尙且陷入、遑論行軍、如日軍不顧一切、冒然侵熱、行經該地時、無待我軍施以攻擊、自必全軍覆没於沙内、敵之利器坦克重砲等、當更無能爲矣云云、</p>
<p>熱河來人談、馮占海部西萬餘人、自吉林開抵熱河後、即積極從事補充、其留吉部隊張純壐司令、業於客歲三十日、率所部一萬餘人、由吉林之五常轉道四洮路開抵熱邊下窪子、現已與馮占海部駐守一處、一俟時機來到、决即奮力抗敵云、（六日）</p>

<h3>怎樣剷除「花會」的惡習</h3>
<p>— 丨丨常一淸君訊</p>
<p>我在上海報紙上常常看見有許多人因打花會失敗以致自殺的紀載，又看見因打花會而去求神拜廟，打開棺材，拖出死屍，對之燒香磕頭，求牠託夢，指示花會預兆種種奇怪的新聞，我總以爲這是不經之談，大約是新間記者胡謅這些趣談，來充　幅，或勾引　者的。到了我在上海住了好幾年，才曉得一點不假。我的一個親戚夫婦兩人，一天到夜，都在那兒神魂顛倒地打花會，一淸早起來，見面便問：「你做什麽夢」？他説：「我夢見貓吃老鼠」，那她　上就去打一個貓；她説：「我夢見大水」，於是他就去打個「水」，若是兩人無夢，便到「城隍廟」去求籤，或到拆字攤上去問卦。兩個人一天總要輪個一千八百，或三千兩吊。加上她的阿弟，他的阿兄，阿兄的老婆，她的女友。他們不見面則已，一見面總是談花會，談得津津有味，我從旁觀　來，他們都已失了常態，恐怕不久他們若要破產，輪盡當光。面孔漂亮點的她，恐怕就要到北京路上去「餐風宿露」，迎人賣笑；生得一臉横肉，眼光蠢獃獃的他，恐怕就要去做梁上君子」，做三雙手，再不然她們只有一條路丨丨自殺。然而你若忠告他們，勸他們不要迷在那上面，那他們會給你白眼　！社會怎樣弄到這種現象？怎樣才可以把這種現象剷除？貴記者見聞廣博，又深識社會底蕰，當必有以敎我。</p>
<p>答：花會是現代社會的病的狀態的一種，爲此所迷而致破產喪身的比比皆是，令親所爲亦可見一斑。此種現象若不從根本上着手，絶不會有剷除的希望，也就和馬路上的娼妓一樣，絶不是什麽政府的雷厲風行和禁令所能爲功，更不是什麽道德家的『砥礪廉恥』『崇尙道德』所能奏效。總而言之，就是一個經濟問題。當妓女的不是不知道廉恥，老實説，她們的『知恥』的良知至少是不亞於現在所謂名人學士，她們奉公守法的行爲，至少也不後於現在一般『知法犯法』『監守自盜』的官兒，然而她們都是失業的一大羣，窮無　歸，衣食無着，不當娼幹什麽？社會上，尤其是現在的都市社會，貧富相懸太遠，而忽而致富，忽而破產的事情，更是層見　出。這種無政府狀態的社會組織日日在獎勵人去投機，獎勵人去胃險，獎勵人去發生『暴富』的夢想，上等者做標金生產，買跑馬票，下等者就去打花會，他們無日無時不在提心吊膽，神經緊張到極高度，因爲他們時時在過生死的關頭，頃刻之間，又以由赤貧驟然變爲大資本家：也可以由大資本家頃刻變成小　三，他們雖然也坐汽車。也飲酒食肉，也早作夜息，然而他們的神明都没有一時刻是安閒的，都市的人多得神經病，也就是這個原故。他們固然時時幻想着：得了花會，中了馬票，標金賺了錢：嬌妻美妾，駟馬高車，豐衣足食，綠酒紅燈，縱慾呵·快樂呵·極度的快樂·極度的幸福呵丨然而另一方面却也懷着無限的恐懼；投機失敗，馬上就使你的原有地位，一落千丈，『王子皇孫，辭樓下殿』從天堂一脚便跌到地獄。這不是個人的個别現象，而是整個社會組織之必然的病態，『打蛇要打七寸，』『殺人須從咽喉着刀』，不然，你今天禁花會，明天牠便變個名目又來了：你今天禁娼，她明天也變了一個名目（如書寓之類）又來了。　實本來也就没有禁絶過，她們的潜勢力是潛伏在社會組織的『肓之上，膏之下』的。所以一個社會學家之觀察社會和一個慈善家或一個道德家之現察社會，其出發點根本不同，其解决之道，也就根本各異。足下以爲何如？</p>

<h3>蘇敎廳整頓南通如皐敎育</h3>
<p>▲兩省校敎訓改進共八點</p>
<p>▲撤換督學校長敎員多人</p>
<p>蘇敎廳周廳長、此次親自出發視察江北敎育、極爲細密、本報已有紀載、現聞已視察南通如皐兩處結果認爲需改進之處甚多、而如皐縣敎育、因經費派别關係、更不遠南通遠甚、已分别令行省縣各敎育機關遵辦、茲探錄其要點於次、</p>
<p>（一）省敎育　甲、通如兩省校、共需改進之點一、訓育方面各導師、對於學生自修缺少親查、須責令切實攷查、二、訓育人員、應常學生接近、藉知學生個性、相機指導、三、各導師應與學生共同生活、不能以查膳宿爲了事、四、敎員請假過多、應嚴厲糾正、五、學期攷試、須考全期所授功課、不許指示範圍、六、應嚴定升降標準、不及五十分者、不得補考、七、訓育人員、應以能力充分、負責任事者充在、八、國文選材陳腐、應力求革亲、乙、通中需改進各點、一、學生禮貌欠佳、師範生尤甚、應糾正、二、軍事訓練服裝動作欠整齊、應注意、三、訓育方面、應責令訓育主任積極改善、師範科應由該科主任、負責改進敎訓各事宜、四、敎員蔣大義宋石安、敎法欠合、應改進、至於敎員陳國寗、課英文、能利用實物及動作練習英語、敎授得法、敎態亦甚活潑、特傳知嘉獎、丙、如師需改進各點、一、校長應破除情面、力謀革新、二、訓育主任、應迅速　負責人員充任、三、敎員　　　之洵陳雲孫敎法均應改進、四敎員兼導師石重光丁廉、荒廢敎務、不能專職、缺課又多、應另聘云、</p>

<p>高級中學課程標準（二）</p>
<p>女生年齡體高體重分級表　男生年齡體高體重分級表</p>
<p>（四）體能此指天生之能力而言、此項能力與體育之關係、正如智力之於其他科學有同樣之關條、但在體育界内、現在尙無劃一標準之體能測騐、各校所採用者大多未能根據科學方法制定、較可　之標準爲卜氏體能測騐（參考Brace·D·H·Ｓcale　ot　Motor　Abhly　tests　Hornesst　Co·New　Yorh）、惟應用時仍須具有一種研究之精神、</p>
<p>（五）技能此指學習得來之能力而言、測騐技能之方法可分爲普遍與特殊兩種、例如從各種體育活動中選出五種、六種、或十種之自然動作、如跑·跳·抛·擲之類、卽可爲普遍之技能測騐、又可用簡單機器測騐、如體力測騐等、至於特殊之測騐、各種運動各有其自已之測騐、　如籃球可以用下列幾種測騐、</p>
<p>㈠投罰球、㈡投籃接球、㈢傳球正確、㈣拍球投籃、㈤傳球速度、</p>
<p>以上五種中、㈠與㈡絶對不可缺少、其餘三種亦應完全採用、如果感覺困難時、至少須選用一種、下列三個舉例可供參考、</p>
<p>附註、學級與成績之關係自非常密切、但現在一般分級每怱之、然須知此種分級標準亦可使每級獲得其相當之敎學成績、故分級時仍須顧及學級、</p>
<p>例㈠打破普通年級制度</p>
<p>第一步按照性别、將各年級學生、分爲男女二組、</p>
<p>第二步將一年級男生及女生、各按檢查身體、結果、將需要特别矯正活動者分出爲一組、稱爲「予」組、然後按體能或技能測騐或二者合用將其餘學生分爲「丑」「寅」兩組、在全級百分之三十或四十以下者爲「丑」組、其餘爲「寅」組、</p>

<h3>東華三比二勝臘克斯</h3>
<p>＝連失兩球形勢危急＝</p>
<p>＝連得三球人心大快＝</p>
<p>臘克斯虎虎逼人、連得兩球、使東華大吃一驚、以爲江山不能保住、幸賴最後之奮鬭、三球連中、結果東華乃以三比二反敗爲勝、昨日棒球塲上、觀者七千餘衆、當日甚空、春意盎然、個個球迷、於揉腮抓耳、焦急憂慮之後、益覺其最後所得之愉快、</p>
<p>兩分鐘即失一球東華開球未進、臘克斯聲勢雄壯、咄咄逼人、凡恩斯傳球左方、阿爾傑邊陲侵入、傳送門前、東華李寗屠開元均未截獲、臘隊中鋒鮑爾登迎之以頭、亦告截得、右翼丁麥逹衝前猛踼、力道殊足、球如離絃之矢、飛入網中、爲狀至美、四座愕然、離開賽僅兩分鐘耳、</p>
<p>十二碼又失一城臘克斯旣下一城、氣熖益盛、全軍逼進、東華危機四伏、陸鍾恩兩次脫險、旋卽反攻、陳家球在敵門前踼任意球、守門撲出、馮　佑遠射出界、義臣洪光短兵相接、再度侵入、攻門無機、家球在旁策應、反鈎攻門、又成野成、於是臘克斯率師衝進、其勢洶洶、李寗鈎球觸手、被罰十二碼球、誠可謂禍不單行、鮑爾登一脚打中、又加一球、二十分鐘之内、東華連失兩球、形勢益見危急、觀者咸以爲江山不保矣、</p>
<h3>南加州大學足球敎練</h3>
<p>年俸一萬二千金元</p>
<p>▲哈華瓊斯繼續合同五年</p>
<p>洛山磯十二月七日訊·美國著名足球敎練哈瓊斯Howard　H·Gones近與南加州大學繼續訂立長期合同五年、專任該校足球敎練、每年年俸一萬二千金元、查哈華瓊斯在南加州大學担任足球敎練、已有八年之久、非特使球員極能服從運動道德、且八年之中、共勝七十二塲比賽、失敗僅十塲、和局兩塲、誠不愧爲名敎練也、</p>
<p>東華屢攻不見效斯時之東華、陣容雖見整齊、但球員行動、頗見遲慢、中衛線、又見衰弱、後衛李寗亦失去威風、球常在敵人脚上、臘克斯奔跑迅速、脚頭爽脆、因東華之氣弱、乃益顯其鋒芒、兩球旣失、力自振作、萬象華幾度入寇、至緊要關頭、均被敵人截獲、馮運佑高球攻門、家球追踪而上、此球原有入門之望、但怱忙之間、家球竟用手將球拍入門内、臘克斯因禍得福、東華則徒哹負負、</p>
<p>十二碼還敬一只混戰多時、臘克斯守衛臬谷夫脚傷離塲、由中鋒包爾登包代、此人心本而呆、臘克斯後方、頓覺軟弱、而前鋒少玄一將、力量亦爲减少、於是臘克斯之氣熖、漸見衰退、東華乘機進攻、萬象華角球送出、落點極佳、你搶我奪、肉搏良久、鮑爾登無功闖禍、遭罰十二碼球、李義臣主踼、門角飛入、先行登記一球、東華之球運乃轉、中央間球、上半時卽行終了、</p>
<p>家球頭頂得一功再戰聲起、東華一鼓而下、萬象華深入敵營、無功而還、臘克斯左右兩鋒先後射門無效、東華乘敵疲憊之時、再度侵入、萬象華傳送得法、守門台維特欲救未得、家球迎之以頭、用勁一頂、七千雙眼睛、送球飛門内、遂成二比二之平手、東華喜色洋洋、最後勝利、似已　有把握矣、</p>
<p>陳虞添轉敗爲勝秋色平分而後、東華前鋒、益見犀利、球在敵陣内東逃西竄、只殺得北狄胡兒、不敢牧馬南下、凡恩斯筋疲力盡、招架爲難、柯克倫氣喘汗流、前鋒陣容散漫、後衛戒備無方、東華求勝心切、不稍怠懈、萬象華得洪光之傳球、平送門前、凡恩斯搶之不得、陳虞添乘機一脚、敵門又破、此後、雙方進退、表演平平、直至鳴金收兵、東華終以三比二勝、而李寗於最後五分鐘曾重傷離塲、惟望其早日痊愈、陣線如下按列、</p>

<h3>金融業之後顧與前瞻</h3>
<p>— 王雨桐</p>
<p>一年容易、又是臘盡春回之際、吾人回憶自九一八國難迄今、怱怱又已經年、此一年中、吾人親身所遭歷者、厥爲外患之迭秉、與夫内憂之紛起、内外交迫、國命之僅得維繫者、已如燕巢危卵、禍變之亟、可謂爲民國以來所僅有、而影響所及、對於握社會經濟樞紐之金融業、打擊尤大、當九一八東北告警以後、金融方面、銀根突見奇緊、證劵市價狂落、未幾一二八滬變又作、情勢益見嚴重、風聲鶴涙、岌岌有不可終日之槪、所幸金融界雖處此創鉅痛深之中、對於事變發生、尙能早爲綢繆、互爲警戒、臨時乃得應付裕如、勉力維持、而於事態正急之際、更採共同合作方法、使所有票據、按匯劃方法、使同業之間、竭力節省現幣之支付、一方公議春節總結帳期限展緩、同時對於外國銀行、不通匯劃、外國銀行、亦表示不乘機收受存欵、於是當前之金融狀况、乃賴以轉穩、不久復有聯合準備庫之組織、錢業方面、亦有財產特别保管委員會之設立、凡此雖皆屬臨時倉卒之設計、要亦可窺見金融界應付環境之苦心也、</p>
<p>本文之作、其主旨在於商榷金融業未來之應趨途徑、惟吾人欲求其解决之方法、應先於金融界過去之業蹟、加以充分之檢討、俾鑒往知來、或可於此中、求得一適當之方策焉、</p>
<p>在今日各地工商衰頽、失業蜂起之秋、而都市經濟、因恃有敏捷有力之金融週轉、獨示畸形之發展、此實爲金融業過去之最大錯誤、固無庸諱言、試就近一二年及本歲中、金融界之最顯著現象、可得而舉者、</p>
<p>㈠公債之過度發行自民國以來、公債發行之種類、都計五十四五種、而其中自國民政府成立後、十六年至二十年五年之間、發行種類、佔二十六種、發行額之總數、爲十萬零一千二百萬元、以各年份言之、計十六年之發行數、爲七千六百零九萬零七十四元、十七年爲一萬零三百萬元、十八年爲二萬四千三百萬元、十九年爲一萬七千四百萬元、二十年爲四萬一千六百萬元、考其所以能發行如許之巨額者、實由於各地工商業衰頽、游資集中、及銀價跌落、爲主要原因、人民感於債價跌落、利率優厚、政府亦正以此迎合人民心理、債劵得增發無已、藉以豐裕一時之收入、上下各有其所鶩之利、債劵因之充滿市塲、債價遂失其固定性、每隨時局之推移、而漲跌極巨、</p>
<p>㈡鈔票之過度發行通貨數量之增减、每隨市塲需要之情形而定、顧在我國、近年各銀行鈔票發行之逐見增加、非因實際之需要增加、乃以公債發行額龐大之故、於是直接造成通貨膨脹之基礎、間接增加信用動搖之機會、查各銀行之發行總額、就上海一埠言、十七年爲一萬二千萬元、二十年爲二萬四千萬元、增加一倍、惟近因百業蕭條、各行發行額、始大見减少、</p>
<p>㈢洋厘暴跌瀋變以後、滬地銀元存底、驟形增加、洋厘猛跌、在本年六月、竟跌至六錢八分八厘一二五、此固爲各金融機關從事未雨綢繆、吸集現欵、以厚實力之故、然考市塲現洋、一旦充斥至是者、其遠因在於各地農村經濟崩漬、及都市之資金集中、自滬變以後、則以金融季節失常、城市工商之衰落、與夫一般人死藏現洋、以備不時之虞、一時相習成風、現洋流通之速度驟减、而擁積之現象成、</p>
<p>㈣地產之投資熱近年來上海之地產事業、風起雲湧、其最稱繁盛時期、當推民國十九年度、其發逹之程度、爲歷年所僅見、據估計最近五年之内、上海房地產價値總額之增加數目、逹二十萬萬兩、而十九年一年所增、佔其半數、其時地產公司、頓如雨後春笋先　產生、各銀行頗有此經營地產投資或投機、以爲副業者、一般外商亦因銀價低落、無從匯寄國外、卽以之投資地產、考此種地產交易之畸形發逹、實以内地資金、咸被吸收偏集於上海、有以助成之、自入民國二十年後、地產交易、其勢雖漸見衰熄、然地產事業、至今猶爲一般人所艶羨之標的也、</p>
<p>過去金融界之現象、綜約旣如上述、於是吾人身居滬地者、觸目佢見繁華興盛之象、内地資金、以鶩利故、均源源吸集上海一地、大都市與城鎭間、經濟之榮枯益顯、循至固有之工商業、驟失金融之調劑、加以外來經濟帝國主義之不斷侵略、政府之捐税、愈益繁重、力旣不勝負荷、奄奄惟趨於垂斃之途、最著者、如絲茶綢各業之早告失敗、卽其顯例、故都市中但見商店倒閉、工廠停頓、萬千職工、慘遭失業、至鄕村之間、除備受都市經濟不振之影響外、益以農村本身、日趨崩潰、情形更見嚴重、蓋歷年以天時人事之不减、荒歉迭告、今秋雖云豐收、據調查所得、江浙兩省之農田農民每耕佃一畝、凈需成本自十元以至十三元、糶去後每畝反須虧本三元、是農民所獲於米產者、如是而已、其他若副產之桑麻豆黍、亦以需求减退、品質低下、而致絶望、今秋中國經濟學社舉行年會時、不佞曾隨同參加、考察各地經濟狀况、足跡所經、歷聞金華、蘭谿、於　各縣縣長、於宴席上報告當地農村經濟之破產、及工商凋散、失業增加情形、與夫各方因所受痛苦之深沉、企望解救之殷切、可知今日之都市工商業、及農村間經濟之衰頽、愈入於嚴重境城、凡此皆爲金融業今後應轉換其目標、而加以深切之注意者也、</p>
<p>抑吾人尤有進者、年來自銀價低落、我國關税增高以後、國外洋貨、除日貨外、一般華貴之舶來品、已漸　普銷於我國各地市塲、於是素處於帝國資本主義　削與壓迫下之國内小工業、乃得稍蒙其惠、而漸有昭蘇勃興之象、其中頗不乏優秀而前途有望者、願大都困於資金之不易周轉、致不獲充分之發展、每坐失良悈、此對於國家、對於社會、實皆爲重大之經濟損失、深望一般覺醒而目光遠鋭之銀行家、能　其歴來之坐視政策、加以切實有力之援助、俾謀我國實業界生產力之恢復及擴增、吾文至此、敢確告於我國之金融業日、今後之金融業、苟欲圖正當之生存與發展、則舍各棄其公債地產之爭利、而轉移其目標於發展生產事業、與救濟農村經濟、將不足以語二十半年度金融業之新使命也、</p>
<h3>戰債問題</h3>
<p>— 建初</p>
<p>本年六月間、洛桑會議舉行之前、華盛頓政府、曾聲請各債務國之注意、任何團結、以圖反抗美國者、非可願見、然債務國之自行集合、　　本身之義務、另訂協定、自無非議之處、故洛桑會議之結果、各國之間、卒獲得一協定焉、</p>
<p>議會議成績之表面觀之、德國之賠欵、自驚人之億兆、遞减至七百萬一千四百萬元、而以德人之能力爲支付之標準、實則協定内容、背後另有文章、蓋以美國修改或取銷戰債爲條件、且需待美國大選過後、始行提出、故當美國大選之後、一星期内、各國卽根據協定、出之以敏捷之外交手段、大刀闊斧、倡言無力支付到期之戰債矣、</p>
<p>德國不能再負賠欵之重担、無力償付、亦屬實倩、曾經國際委員會及經濟專家證明之、洛桑協定之結果、實爲不可避免这事實、而美國之一　動作、亦屬勢所必然、兩年以來、其全部問題之核心、　在美國之如何措置耳、昨年國會通過胡佛延付議案之時、曾肯切規定、以後未得國會之同意、總統不得再作同樣之讓步、</p>
<p>議會中之民主共和兩黨、俱反對戰債之修改或取銷、胡佛總統、亦曾明白表示、反對取銷、然戰債問題、長此遷延、國際贸易、最蒙不利、殊非各國之福、而有立待謂整之必要也、洛桑會議、延期至法國大選後舉行、要求延付之牒文、又遲至美國大選後、始行送出、政治家之規避責任、照然若揭、然與戰債問題之本身、不無小補、蓋當總統競選期内、法國在洛桑之讓步、殆無可能、美國亦然、戰債問題、錯綜複雜、决非熱烈之競選期内、呼號呌嚷之餘、所能解决也、</p>
<p>德國因公開承認民窮財盡、無力償付之結果、賠欵得以修改、而英法與其他債務國、雖作同樣之請求、而無同樣之承認、惟其用意所在、不言而喻、戰債修改之協定、如難如願、則祇有藉辭延宕、以緩時日、其要求修改戰債之目的、在於抵銷德國賠欵之收入、美國堅决拒絶修改、否認戰債與賠欵有任何關係、而事實所昭示者、兩者之間、有相互之因果在焉、</p>
<p>至倡言修改者、亦另有其相當之原因、物價慘落、貨物之出口、抵充支付美債者、日益增多、因金鎊之日就跌落、英國付出之數、自三七·八六○·○○○鎊、增至五四·五一八·○○○鎊、至美國之堅却債務國之伸請、亦自持之成理、夫債務國之屢次請求、無非藉辭貧窮、無力償付、而其軍備所費、爲額極鉅、實非故作刁難、以圖逃避乎、一九三一年、英國軍備費用、大於支付美債者三倍、法國爲十三倍、意國爲廿倍、比國爲五倍、各國其誠貧窮乎、故美國當局、始終認戰債與軍費有關戰債與軍縮、更有密切之關係、英國設能允諾裁减軍備、盡如美國所期望者、則新戰債會議之時機熟矣、</p>
<p>英法兩牒文中、力主重開會議、通盤討論、胡佛延付之期、更需延長、美國國會、儘可拒絶、大勢所趨、戰債問題之解决、將　諸來春之國際經濟會議討論之、美國政黨、雖曾宣稱、國際債務之問題、不當列諸國際經濟會議之議程、然無論如何、最後解决之方法、必需及時獲得、否則遺祸無窮、後患索堪設想最近之將來、世界或有新的發展、贸易自障碍、容可　除、而繁榮之回復、其有幾乎、</p>

<p>欲逹此境、必須先將一切自由競爭之市埸極度縮小、使之不是以控制價格而後可也、</p>
<p>時至今日、有多數人熱烈主張採用複金本位、爲此説者各種人土俱有之銀礦主人欲增加銀之用途以抬高銀之價格、與遠東貿易有關之商人欲抬高銀價、以增加中國及印度待用銀國之購買力、經濟學者以黄金之供给有限、不足以供一切之用而圖以白銀彌其缺、理想家欲　二者之調節以鞏固繁榮之地位、政治家企望實現此等理想、以發揚政治之威力、彼等之目的雖不同、而其主張採用複金本位則一也、</p>
<p>此問題之内容至　研究之價値、惟爲簡捷起見今暫留待以後再加討論、而先觀貨幣其他之要點、</p>
<p>註一）在事實上、補幣之重量不必等於其地金之重量、因其量過重將使其使用不便也、國庫亦應須常備充分之現幣以備兑現、　須常備若于之地金、隨時可以供交換之用足矣、惟　幣中所含之純銀價格則不可超出於其地金價格之上、因此而有之則一般嗜利者將收幣鎔之以供其他之用途、以其較賤於購買地金以供用也或者又將以之鎔成地金、再向　幣廠易取較多數量之幣也、　　　　　　　　　　（本章完）</p>
<h3>債券投資利益的幾個簡易算法</h3>
<p>— 王敦夫</p>
<p>運用資本的方法，各人不同，有的存入銀行，有的買公司股票，也有的買公債票。不過存入銀行，利息不很高，買股票，又有甗本的危險。所以在選擇未决定的公司時候，兔得利息損失，還是買公債票比較適宜。因爲公債票的利息，比較厚一些，比别種股票又來得確實安全，如果有急需的時候，或者想作别種投資的時候，可以向銀行請求抵押，也可隨時在市塲脱手。周轉很便利，的確是適當的投資目的物。</p>
<p>有的人以爲公債票的投資，周轉固然便利，可惜國家的財政情形差一些，於投資安全確實這一點或許有問題。老實説，最近這幾年，國家的財政雖然支絀，債劵的本利償付，　能够按期舉行。去年一二八滬變之後，在延期减息案中，更明定每月在海關税内劃出八百六十萬元作爲支配各項債務基金，永爲定案，以後無論財政如何困難，不得將前項基金稍有搖動，並不得再有變更。這末一來，國債基金，更形穩固。</p>
<p>這樣看來、公債票的投資，實在比别種證劵確實。然公債投資者所得的利益，那不可一槪而論，，因爲各種債券的條件有些不同。現在利率雖然劃一，可是期限有長短，還本有多少，市價有高下，利益也有高薄。利益的計算，俗名呌做合息」，日本人把英文的（Ｙiela)，譯作「利迥」。普通分爲收入利迥與債還利迥兩種。</p>
<p>（一）收入利迥（Ｃurrent　Yields）收入利迥又呌做直接利迥，由利息收入與買進格作比例算出，例如週息八厘的債券，照票面八折買進，那末收入利迥，就是週息一分。</p>
<p>（二）償還利迥（Redemption　Yields）償還利迥又呌做間接利迥，是利息收入的利迥，再拿償還本金的損益來較正一下。所溢價的公債票，償還利迥比收入利迥低，折價的公債券，償還利迥比收入利迥高。這種利迥的計算，都拿債票的整個期限爲標準，所以又呌做最終利迥，如果債票在期内中　，那又呌中間利迥，前一凑巧買了就中　。那就呌最初利迥。</p>
<p>我們現在要算的，就是償還利迥，債還利迥的算法，在外國有詳　公債價値表及公債利迥表，我們只要按表驥索，没有計算之勞。又有完備的年金表，可以應用年金複利的算法，得到更正確的結果。可是我們現在公債票的情形，比歐美複雜。歐美的很詳細的公債價値表和利迥表，都不適用，市塲上買　頂多的庫券，還本數前後參差，没有一定的規例，也不便應用年金複利的算法，而丨般商人的智識程度，又差了一些。因此種種，債券的利迥，只能採用一些簡捷了當的算法，只求他大到不錯，談不上十分正確。下列五種算法，都是根據這個標準搜集的，前四種適用於抽　還本的公債，後一種適用於分期　還本的庫券，金</p>
<p>現在分述於後。</p>
<p>（甲）公債利迥算法公債利迥算法，分爲平均算法，華爾街習慣算法，何楷算法，及差益年金算法等四種，的習慣算法比較正確。</p>
<p>（一）平均算法平均算法是單利的算法，又呌做均分算法，所得的利迥，結果似乎高了一些，現在歐美各國這法子已經廢除了，算式如下。</p>
<p>票面額丨買進價格</p>
<p>（票面額×票面利率）＋丨丨丨丨丨丨丨丨</p>
<p>利迥＝丨丨丨丨丨丨丨丨丨丨丨丨丨丨丨丨丨··················（１）</p>
<p>上式是計算折價債票的，如果是溢價債票，那末式子如下。</p>
<p>買進價格丨票面額</p>
<p>（票面額×票面利率）丨丨丨丨丨丨丨丨丨</p>
<p>利迥＝丨丨丨丨丨丨丨丨丨丨丨丨丨丨丨丨丨···················（２）</p>
<p>買進價格</p>
<p>（二）華爾街習慣算法（Thumb　Method）這是美國紐約華爾街（Wall　Street）通行的算法，也分溢價和折價兩種。不過有一點應該注意的，如果溢價或折價的差額很大，還本的期限又很長，這算法不很適用。</p>
<p>（子）溢價算法</p>
<p>㈠計算票面價値與溢價的差數</p>
<p>㈡以還本的年期除溢價的差數所得的是溢價差數的每年平均分担約數。</p>
<p>㈢從每年利息收入總數减去溢價差數的每年平均分担約數。</p>
<p>㈣第三步的結果，先拿　票買進價格來除。</p>
<p>㈤第三步的結果，再拿票面價値利溢差數之每年平均分担約數之和數來除。</p>
<p>㈥出第四第五兩步的平均數，這個平均數就是公債票的利迥率如果列成算式則如下。</p>
<p>（票面額×利率）丨買進價格丨票面額　（票面額×利率）丨買進價格丨票面額</p>

<p>買進價格丨票机額</p>
<p>買進價格　　　　票面額＋丨丨丨丨丨丨丨丨</p>
<p>年限</p>
<p>（丑）折價算法</p>
<p>㈠計算折價與票面額的差數。</p>
<p>㈡以還本年限除抑價之差數（卽差益），所得的是折價差數的每年平均分派約數。</p>
<p>㈢以折價差數的每年平均分派約數和每年利息收入總數相加。</p>
<p>㈣第三步的結果，先拿買進價格除牠。</p>
<p>㈤第三步的結果，再拿債票面額和抑價差數的每年平均分派約數的差數來除牠。</p>
<p>㈥求第四第五兩步的平均數，這個平均數就是債票利迥率。</p>
<p>以上六步，列成算式如下。</p>
<p>（票面額×利率）＋票面額丨買進價格　（票面額×利率）＋票面額丨買進價格</p>

<h3>關於宣傳</h3>
<p>— 招勉之</p>
<p>你想，减價已經便宜，大减價自然額外佔光，况且另外還有「照碼對折」，「　一送一」，「再加贈品」的附带最惠條件，交易的結果，一定買方賣方都以爲是佔光的，没有人吃虧，雙方都便宜，這眞是各得其所了。</p>
<p>不過，自己佔光也許是别人吃虧，自己吃虧便有别人佔光；這些，想是要想及的。自己吃虧　不到，别人吃虧由它去，買賣都　定這個主意，佔便宜變成了處世的原則。</p>
<p>根據這一點，人們的心理可以從極，大，頂，特别，非常等極度的字眼去捉摸。譬如電影廣告，我們知道城市裏是些想金想肉的人們，因此，「美貌年輕」，「風騷肉感」，「軟玉温香」，「皇后皇帝」，「特别浪漫」等一類的述語是極爲得體的。已經是傑作，不能算偉大，已經是偉大傑作，不能算唯一，因此，唯一偉大傑作是足以吸收大衆的文字。已經是同志，得要忠實，忠實了的同志，得要表示「最忠實」。其他女子接摩有「神清氣爽」，少女歌舞有「神秘裸體，犧牲色相」，諸如此類非才不能體貼人微地寫出來的尖鋭宣傳文字是抄也抄不了。總之，爲了自己而去伺候他人，要無微不至，對方如想殺人，我們該立刻貢獻千刀萬斬，肝腦塗地，血肉狼藉的凌遲材料。這些擴大宣傳的目的，是利用你想佔光的心理引誘你去吃虧，一次不成功，下次再來一次。，如像開會一樣，有擴大會議，有全　，　　會，大會，等以没示會的本質之　重血可　。至於到底怎樣，只　等後來事實　明。　時　，吃虧的吃虧，佔交的佔光，又得費才子們的事去想出另外花樣來了。</p>
<p>在中國，文人才子的用途許是多了一些，　則操縱生殺　的不是他們，但文章總是少不了他們的。不要説普通的宣傳和廣告以至　　小説·　情尺　······用得着他們，就是某某軍長想替自己聲明一下子，某某富翁想替母親大人做一篇壽文，也非他們不可的。爲了用途如此之廣，才子人數供過於求，而壽文宣言究竟有限，這實在是一件不易應付的事。最近三中全會感到才　問題，曾經議定一個大學限制文科，增加理科的方案，好像是頗切中時　的。</p>
<p>但，事實告訴我們，市面上没有需要的商品，工廠　盡量製造，是不會討好的。一個對現代社會經濟缺乏認識力的理科學者對於現社會的貢獻，和一個頭腦糊　的才子差不了多少的。不信，請看學醫的人也有去當縣長的，學地質學的人也有去當稅局長的，另外還有不少的著名才子的出身也是研究理科的，這有什麽辦法呢？那一樣用處多，便幹那一樣吧！如果平平安安可以有飯吃，誰還願意用到减價和大减價等等伎倆？</p>
<p>果眞是此後具有科學頭腦的人增加起來，倒也是很好的現象。必然地有一天要事事根據理性和事實幹下去，一切在試騐室和顯微鏡下看透了的現象都很請楚了。那時候做壽文和宣言的才子固然無大用而且减少，只恐怕「擴大宣傳」失了效用，「最」字不時行，「神秘」也打破，連「减價」也没人要了。</p>
<h3>聰明人與儍子</h3>
<p>— 吳澤炎</p>
<p>讀儒林外史的，凡看到王玉輝逼自己女兒餓死成烈女那一段時，總會發生一種夾雜着鄙夷和憤懣的感想。其實如像這一類的事：希望他人能挺身出來殺身成仁，成民族英雄，成烈士，成烈女，成好漢，而自己却躱在背後，叨光享福，原就舉目皆是，確實爲我國道地的國粹。尤其是在目前國難臨頭的年頭，盻望他人作烈士的心理，更是普遍流行。所以尹奉吉在虹口花園投擲炸彈的壯舉，雖然一般人也都豎起大姆指贊歎歡喜，而中國則終拿不出一個甚至半個尹奉吉者，其理由便在這一點。</p>
<p>假使我們要舉例，隨口説來便是：前一個月，有上海某救國團體電請十九路軍移師北上，出關殺賊；而報紙上屢次登載血魂團「愛國男兒」被捕的消息，字裏行間，亦凛然大有激厲後來之意。就是蘇炳文兵敗退入俄境後，某要人也鄭重電勸其重返黑省，與日人再接再厲。至於催促全國各將領動員抗日的文電，則每當時局稍現嚴重時，更會如雪片樣的滿天飛。這種種，我們敢不説是好意？但，在好意的背後，明顯地另有一個希望他人挺身出來做烈士，做民族族英雄，而自己則在後方叨光享福的心理在活躍地跳動。</p>
<p>明白了這種心理，我們便可以去解釋爲什麽眞在東北作戰的義勇軍會愈打愈少，而上海×××後援會，以及全國「誓爲後盾」的民衆，會愈來愈多，愈唱愈起勁。</p>
<p>但，烈士好漢以至民族英雄等等的儍子，總有一天會死盡的，現在已經死得不少了。到有一天中國所剩的全是「誓爲後盾」的聰明人時，日本大陸政策便可完成，而那時，也或者就是龐大如熊聰明如猴子的中國的末日。</p>
<h3>我有了一個愛人</h3>
<p>— 李梨</p>
<p>我有了一個愛人，她眞的是非常愛我的，簡直使我感到：「我是她的！」　　關於這一點，我並不是空造謠言，在這裏，有事實可以拿來證明的。</p>
<p>有一次，她對我説：「朋友，我愛你，因爲愛你的緣故，所以，我要把你像一個　塊一樣，甜蜜地含在我的嘴裏。」</p>
<p>我聽了之後，想：「這可眞是了不得的，這樣一來，我不是要給她弄得消夫了嗎？</p>
<p>可是，我是胆怯怯地，没有說出口來。</p>
<p>又有一次，她對我説，「好人，我愛你，因爲愛你的緣故，所以，我要送一件東西給你；可是，我想來想去，實在想不到一件東西，可以送來給你；好，好人，我把我的心兒送給了你吧。」</p>
<p>我聽了之後，是惶恐起來了，想：「啊，更加了不得，一個人的心，怎麽可以拿來送人呢？一個人對於挖取心兒這一件事，是可以辦得到的嗎？」</p>
<p>可是，我又是胆怯怯地，没有説出口來。</p>
<p>再有一次，她對我説，「我的好人，我愛你，因爲愛你的緣故，所以，我要很誠懇的向你提出一個要求：我的好人，請把你的心兒給了我罷。」</p>
<p>我聽了之後，急得落下涙來了，想：「我不要愛人了，不敢要愛人了，有了愛人，是麻煩，而且危險的。」</p>
<p>可是，我還是胆怯怯地，祇是自己心裏想自己心裏難過，也没有說出口來。</p>
<h3>眞空管理有些什麽</h3>
<p>— 夏</p>
<p>眞空管的名詞已經很普遍了，我們顧名思義便可知道眞空管是什麽也没有的玻璃管。但，眞空管并不眞空，事實告訴我們，這管裏的的確確還有多到我們不能想像的東西。</p>
<p>假設現在有一個五时直徑的圓玻璃球，牠裏面的空氣已用抽氣機抽到相當的程度，換名話説，可以説是眞空了。然而這玻璃球裏面還有下列的好些東西：</p>
<p>㈠　分子··　　二八八·五００·０００·０００·０００·個</p>
<p>㈡氣分子··　　七七·六００·０００·０００·０００·個</p>
<p>㈢　分子··　　五·四五·０·０００·０００·０００·個</p>
<p>㈣二氣化炭分子··　　六四四·０００·０００·０００·</p>
<p>㈤　分子··　　四·四七０·０００·０００·個</p>
<p>㈥　分子··　　二五·０００·０００·個</p>
<p>㈦　分子··　　五·０００·０００·個</p>
<p>而且雖然有三六九，九九八，四九五，○○</p>
<p>○，○○○個分子在這管裏面活動，可是並不覺得些微的擁擠，至於球内的氣壓，僅不過大氣壓的百萬分之一百。要是球内的氣壓等於大氣壓，那末將有二八，九八八，四二三，五二○，○○○，○○○，○○○，個分子存在。所以直到現在爲止，在這世界上，還没有絶對的眞空管。</p>

<h3>時代与愛的歧路三十五</h3>
<p>— 張資平</p>
<p>順興接着問他的母親。此刻淑華又看了她的哥哥一眼。於是好一會大家都沉默起來了。</p>
<p>聽見從下面有人走上來的脚步音。海泉向門首一望，一個老媽兒拿出一張五元的鈔票三塊洋錢送到卓媽的面前來。海泉看見那三個銀幣中，一個是「袁頭」，二個是「孫中山」。卓媽一聲不響，先把一個「孫中山」安置在右手的兩個指頭上，再用左手憸起「袁世凯」來，向着「孫中山」敲了一敲，那種銀音眞是　　可聽。她再掉上一個「孫中山」，也同樣的敲了一下。過後，他便把鈔票和銀幣一併　進衣袋裏去了。</p>
<p>「老六的，是麽？」</p>
<p>看見那個老媽子還站在側邊，卓媽問了她一聲。</p>
<p>「是六姑娘的。」</p>
<p>老媽子望了望卓媽的神氣，忙退下去了。</p>
<p>坐了一會，海泉便向她們母子三人告辭。他想，在今夜　再　　可以　進一步接近卓淑華的機會了。</p>
<p>「大家一起看電影去好不好？」</p>
<p>卓媽笑着向海泉。</p>
<p>「林先生，陪我們去一趟吧。」</p>
<p>淑華滿臉笑容，伸出雙手來扯了上下海泉的衣袖。他雖然對她有點戀戀不捨，但是再没有興致陪他們一家人去看電影了。</p>
<p>（十六）</p>
<p>從卓淑華家裏走出來，覺得自己的心情也和外面的氛圍氣一樣的冷寂。他無理由地長吁了一口氣，接近嘴邊的　暗的空氣中，便起了一陣乳色的蒸氣。</p>
<p>他走出北四川路的電車道邊來了，覺得體温比坐在卓淑華家裏時還高了一點。他本想早點回曾公館裏去的。但是一想像到鶴子夫人和日本佬那樣親暱的情形，心裏又有説不出的難過。</p>
<p>「自己該到什麽地方去好呢？······啊！苦悶！苦悶！找不着出路的靑年的苦悶！」</p>
<p>他在　道上痴站了好一會，愈想愈悽愴。他望望馬路的南端，再望望北首，然後又仰起頭來望了望天際。他看見這個繁華熱閙的大上海，給一重灰白色的帳幕│很濃厚的一重夜　│籠罩着，除掉了附近的彩色的尼安電光以外，一切的燈光都是朦朧不淸的，只是放散出無對的黄色的輻射光線。他拿出了手巾來拭了一拭眼睛。</p>
<p>「　絲卓只是想利用自己。豈有此理！」</p>
<p>他到這邊來是抱有一種絶大的希望而來的。然而這個希望終於給造成者之手打破了。</p>
<p>「若是鶴子夫人知道我一個人站在這馬路邊這樣的孤寂這樣的悲傷，她會不會趕來接我回去，安慰我呢？」</p>
<p>他剛剛起了這個念頭，又忙自己抑制着。他知道自己的神經太疲勞了，所以會作種種無聊的想像。</p>
<p>他從懷裏檢出小錶來一看，還差五分鐘就　九點了。他想，還這樣早，回去看那些日木佬的高興的臉孔，太没意思。於是他想，搭車太快了。决意走路，走到愛多亞路口，然後再搭公共汽車。</p>
<p>最好是過了十二點鐘才回去，│等他們睡了後才回去。自己有彈簧銷的錀匙，可以不呌門。······决意不理她了！縱令她出來招呼自己，也莫　她了！</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>談自由</h3>
<p>— 吾</p>
<p>早上起來，翻開報紙一看，我不禁快樂得跳起來、原來政府决心保障我們老百姓的自由了。於是我手舞足蹈，喊應一家大小，連那還未满十個月的大兒子我也費盡力量的告訴他説：「來，你們該歡喜，現在我們有了自由了。不但是「做禮拜」或「不吃猪肉」不成問題，就是集會結社言論出版居住以至於吃飯拉屎都一百二十分的自由自在了。要做什麽便做什麽。誰也不來管我們了」「眞的嗎？」老年人似乎有點不相信，照他的經騐看來，或許當我又在發瘋，於是我急得耳紅面赤，説：「誰騙你呢？現有報紙爲證·」</p>
<p>於是我將報紙遞給他們，可是小孩子究竟不懂事，隨手一下便將報紙撕破了。看上去，似乎還有點怒意。</p>
<p>然而我到底還是高興，我覺得這是不可多得的機會，我得自由的樂一樂了。但是低頭一想，我們老百姓從前不也是很自由的嗎？没有誰來禁止一餐不准吃三個大餅，没有誰來禁止冷天不穿皮袍，没有誰來禁止駡人「倷娘」，也没有誰來禁止買賣仇貨。更没有誰來禁止跳舞救國。那末我們不是早已受着自由的恩賜了嗎？其後仔細一想，現在是對自由加之保障，保障者，保障自由於一定之範圍中也。這範圍究竟能有多大，當然用不着小民過問，或許竟可小到和雀籠一般大小。小雀子在籠中「自由」的呌，跳，比較長鳴雲霄，翱翔於天地之間當然有不勝今昔之嘆，現在爲了保障起見，牢牢的加上一層銅牆鐡壁，於是這可憐的呌與跳，便在這重重的保障之中不復爲外人所知道了。所以這保障是來得非常有意義的。至於假使説恢復自由，那便是等於開籠放鳥，有誰能保證這不有甚於縱虎歸山呢？</p>
<p>然而話又説回來了，從此我們小民總算又有一次嚴密的保障。以後可以名正言順的説我們所要説的，做我們所當做的，甚至於自由住在租界上來自由的打麻雀也無所不可，雖然這還須加上一句「要知後事如何，且聽下回分解。」</p>
<p>最後我要告訴讀者，我是在自由的保障中自由的嚕囌一通了。你們可不要忘記你們的自由現在正在保險櫃中呀！</p>

<h3>糖</h3>
<p>— 盛展能</p>
<p>糖爲人類必要食料之一，不應視爲一種嗜好品此種碳水化物之主要作用爲供給人類以體温，而爲筯肉能力之根源。</p>
<p>㈠糖之性質</p>
<p>糖之分子式爲Ｃ１２Ｈ２２Ｏ１１，係單斜系結晶體，無色透明，惟粗糖因含有夾雑物，故帶赤褐色，在二百度至二百十度時即脫水而成褐色之塊狀物，稱爲焦糖（Ｃaramel），此物常供醬油，酒，醋，肉汁之着色用。</p>
<p>蔗糖遇熱濃硫酸則碳化。其濃水溶液與同容積之濃硫酸相混，則此混合物變黑，並生成二氧化碳，二氧化硫及水蒸氣。</p>
<p>蔗糖之溶液中若加微量之無機酸而温熱之或放置之時，則發生水分解而生成等量之葡萄糖及果糖。其反應式如下Ｃ１２Ｈ２２Ｏ１１＋Ｈ２ＯＣ６Ｈ１２Ｏ６＋Ｃ６Ｈ１２Ｏ６</p>
<p>蔗糖　　　葡萄糖　　　果糖</p>
<p>此所得果糖及葡萄糖之混合物稱爲轉化糖，市售之轉化糖爲稍帶褐色之塊，廣用於糖果及酒精等之構造。</p>
<p>如使蔗糖之溶液與釀母接觸而放置多時，則蔗糖因釀母中轉化酵素之作用變爲葡萄糖及果糖，終起酒精醱酵而生成酒精。</p>
<p>蔗糖與醋酸碳及醋酸鈉共煑時，則生成八乙醯蔗糖（Ｃ１２Ｈ１４Ｏ３（o·co·ch3）8），由此可證明其分子式中含有八個氫</p>
<p>氧基。此種事實及其加水分解時之行爲，已暗示蔗糖係由一分子之葡萄糖與一分子之果糖結合而成者，然蔗糖之構造式至今尙未能明確决定。</p>
<p>㈡甜味由來</p>
<p>糖之甜味係因其分子式中含有八個氫氧基所致，蓋一般有機化合物中之醇類及其誘導體等（糖亦包含在内），常因其成分中所含氫氧基之數而增加其甜味。一般甘味之感知與温度大有關係，據衛勃爾氏之學説，謂吾人感知甘味之最高温度爲五十至五十二·五度，過此即難以辨認，所以吾人感知糖液甘味之濃度常因温度而有差異，例知在常温時所能感味者爲○·一％之溶液，然在零度時則非○·四％之溶液不能辨認，又甘味之感覺，一般較苦味爲速，而殘留度較弱，如服含用有糖分之苦味藥，則最先感覺者爲甘味而苦味次之，迨後甘味雖去而苦味仍存，即其明證。</p>
<p>㈢生理作用</p>
<p>凡供給營養之最簡單化合物，名曰營養素，營養素共分四大類，即蛋白質，脂肪，碳水化合物及無機鹽類，其中碳水化合物之主要作用爲供給體温，爲人類筋肉能力之根源，如澱粉，動物性澱粉（Ｇlycogen），蔗糖，麥芽糖，葡萄糖等屬之，故蔗糖爲人類必要食料之一，而不應視爲一種嗜好品。</p>
<p>人體内所攝取之蔗糖因受轉化酵素之作用而分解爲葡萄糖，果糖等，通過腸壁，經毛細管而入間靜脈血後，更由動脈血（此時糖分已完全變爲葡萄糖）之移運而流入筋肉組織中以氧化分解，所生之碳酸氣自靜脈管流出，此時因分解作用而所生之熱，即用以保持體温，且供給化學能於筋肉，此即吾人體力之根源’又吾人攝取之過量之糖分則每因醱酵而變爲酪酸，或絲毫不起變化流入血液中，更由腎臟排洩而出。</p>

<p>政治的要人們，倘若把連年内戰的軍費，一致對外，則東三省不致陷於日本。</p>

<p>店員通訊</p>
<h3>店員如何抗日的研究</h3>
<p>自從去年周良驥君提出「站在店員工友學徒的地位，如何可以盡中華民國一份子的義務，幹抗日救國的工作」的問題以後，我們因這個問題重大，並且須依各種的客觀條件來决定，所以公開徵求讀者的意見。除了去年已發表的幾篇外，尙有很多的來信，都是提出很好的方法；如今我們把他彙集起來，作一個不唱高調，依各個人能力所能做，而需要各個人切實的去做的結論：</p>
<p>第一，須要嚴厲實行經濟絶交；在許多讀者來信中，差不多都提到這個方法，我們也承認，並且認爲是最有效力，以往的事實告訴我們：「經濟絶交」祗是一個呼聲，雖然也成爲事實，但祇是如曇花的一現，短得可憐！受了「一二八」的重大的打擊，結果仍是有幾千萬的仇貨進口，國人之無組織，無持久心，於此可見一般！我們以站在店員等的地位立論，不作遠離事實的論調，祗須各個人自已切實奉行，不論是穿的吃的，日常用的，一律採購國貨，國貨所缺乏而不得不用的，最低限度也祗可採用西洋貨。由一已而推行到一家，再推行到自已的親戚朋友。一個人如此，全國如此！即使没有任何組織，也可逹到「經濟絶交」的目的。我們並不是不要組織，實在是國人缺乏組織！倘能看準目標一致步伐的行去，實際上已成功了無形的偉大的組織。</p>
<p>不過，很有許多奸商，利用提倡國貨的牌子，用仇貨來朦混顧客，以逹到他個人發財的目的，這種人固然可惡，但到這種地方，就可顯出店員們的忠實的愛國心，至於如何的施行，請看鄭金門先生的來信：</p>
<p>「······顧客購買貨物，本來不一定要」</p>
<p>仇貨的，因了價格低廉或顔色美麗，祗須合意，買了就算。就不暇多問這是東洋貨或西洋貨了。更有少數的可惡的店員，明知是東洋貨，却諱言是西洋貨或逕説是國貨。致使一般的愛國同胞，暗中大上其當，大買而特買其仇貨了！這種店員，旣無愛國觀念，祗知拍老閶馬屁而欺騙顧客，最堪痛恨！」</p>
<p>「我所提出的方法，就是顧客來購貨的時候，應當儘先把國貨或西洋貨給他選擇，有時顧客在櫉窗内已擇定日貨，你可輕輕對他説：『這是日貨，請你不要買。』我想顧客如稍有人心的話，必赧然釋手而買别種貨色的了。</p>
<p>「不過此事須要做得秘密，假若被與你不和睦同事聽見，在老闆面前戳起壁脚來，那你的飯碗一定要打碎；所以最好是聯絡起店内的同事，大家一致去幹。即使有點洩漏老闆也　好暗暗　苦，决不會把全體職員一起辭退的。…···」</p>
<p>鄭君的話雖然憤激一點，但却也是實情，顧客購貨的時候，是不可以欺騙朦混的。鄭君所述的方法，在可能範圍内，也不無可以採取之處。</p>
<p>第二，準備武力抵抗；抵抗暴日本有積極與消極兩種，消極的就是上述的「經濟絶交」，積極的就是充實國防準備武力抵抗，雖然武力抵抗不是店員所可能的事，但不能不有這種準備，去督促我們的政府。如應中元先生的來信説！　　「······有錢的出錢，拿錢來辦子彈，槍砲，飛機，防空器械等等，有力的出力，大家來受軍事訓練，作充實後防的準備。同時更希望全國的軍事長官，永息内爭，共禦外侮，使所有槍口，個個向外，成爲强有力的國防軍隊。······」</p>
<p>雖然應君的主張，一時不能實現，店員因了職守及其他關係，不能去受軍事訓練，但這種思想，却不能没有。以後可以慢慢的想法突破環境，逹到實行的境域。</p>
<p>第三，增進個人智識如姚狂生先生的來信説：「救國先要救地方，救地方先要救自家，救自家先要救自身，自身的學問能力，能不能負起這救國的責任？否則務須補救自身的學問能力。······」</p>
<p>的確，救國是需要高深的智識與偉大的能力的，我們店員因了環境支配，不能受到高深的敎育！那是毌庸諱言，因爲要負起救國的重任起見，所以我們無論在什麽時候，任何困難之下，都要作增進智識的準備。</p>
<p>砲聲響了，山海關已淪入敵手，日帝國主義又帶着猙獰的面目，挾着殺人的利器，來屠殺我們的同胞，軍事長官也都紛紛通電，願爲前驅，與暴日搏戰。在這民族危亡的當兒，我們處在後方的民衆，應如何的堅毅不屈，在精神上物質上作抗日救國的工作。</p>

<h3>同情者（十二續）</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>孟國寳看他那樣子自然也是不高興，便想着王老二對於東家老爹那樣恭敬，自己替人家把東家得罪了，那可是不大好，便笑道：假如我自己有錢，我一定做放賬的生意，不買田。東家聽了這話，臉上才有了笑容，便道：像你先生在城裏住家的人，有錢可以存到錢莊銀行裏去，又何必放債呢？他兩人在這裏談話·王老二却不便搭腔，只是和那個坐在扁擔上的人，問問他們别個莊子上閙　災不　　災西鄕去　没有。今春　　　　　　成不　。看　　上的烟絲完了。，又到裏面抓一把來，茶乾子，又拿瓦壺去重泡一壺。然後他就請孟國寳陪着東家老爹，又出去把村子上的左右鄰居請了幾位來。孟國寳見人多了，自溜出堂屋來，繞到後面菜園子裏來換換濁氣。他站在北瓜架下見黄土牆的窗户裏面，正是人家的厨房，王二嫂在灶上灶下不住的轉着，臉紅紅的，汗珠子由她的　　上直流下來。只看那灶上的水蒸汽，結成一片白霧，還是突突向上冒着，這就可以知道人是怎樣的忙便笑道：今天可把二嫂子忙懷了。牠忽然聽到窗户外有人説話，一看是孟先生，便笑道：東家老爹來了那總是應該忙的。説話時牠的眼鳥珠子在長的睫毛裏一轉，又低了頭。孟國寳看她有些不好意思的樣了，自不便在這裏詀着，轉身，就要走。王二嫂却趕過來，站在窗户口上，向他笑着低聲道：孟先生。孟國寳走過來時，他却伸手在衣袋裏抓了一大把北瓜子出來，放在窗户台上，笑道，外頭人多，瓜子一定吃完了。牠説畢，她一低頭鑽到灶下燒火去了。孟國寳便站在瓜堋下慢慢的嗑瓜子。</p>

<h3>加萊古柏的禽獸裝飾</h3>
<p>— 吻濤</p>
<p>海外珍聞</p>
<p>這或許是實得聽聞的消息吧。最近加萊古柏在皮佛萊山新建了一所宏偉的住宅。屋内的修裝非常奇麗和壯觀。他幾乎全部是用菲洲的禽獸來佈置這屋内的一切，他爲了這屋的修裝，所以不惜耗費了巨大的金錢，並且親自歷盡艱苦，遍踏千山重　，　獸叢居的菲洲，去狩獵許多奇禽珍獸，搜集在他皮佛萊山的住宅裏。他經過幾次切實的整理，考究；再僱用了幾個雕刻師，把這許多禽獸骨頭，雕成種種器具，分配修裝在室内。他這次總共所獲的禽獸，的確可以比得上任何獸片中的禽獸。他幾乎把這整個菲洲的禽獸都搬上他的住宅裏了。</p>
<p>好萊塢的修裝，雖然可說無奇不有的。但，這種修裝在好萊塢却還是第一次見到呢。</p>
<p>他住宅大門口的二旁，陳設了二隻猛獅客室的地上鋪了一塊用各種獸皮拚成的大地氈。室内椅上是一律攤着斑馬皮氈子。中央的圓桌上，攤了一塊虎皮氈。牆上四週掛了幾對異樣的鹿頭，及許多用獅骨做成的照相架。几上陳設的香烟盤，是全用野猪蹄做成的，這不是多麽奇麗而考究啊。丨汽車門上的柄，是用野猪骨做成的。車厢内的座位，用長頸鹿的皮鋪著。他寢室地板上，也是同樣攤著一塊火獸皮氈。床上鋪著一條用五十張羚羊皮做成的氈了。室内牆上掛着許多犀牛，羚羊，豹，長頸鹿的獸頸。書桌上的書夾，是用獅骨做成的。總之，他室内一切的修裝是完全用菲洲奇異的禽獸，來佈置的。假使你説要去參觀菲洲的奇禽珍獸，那麽他住宅裏是個絶好的動物園。</p>

<p>英國片總不免表現他們固有的國民性丨嚴厲的遲緩，惟有這部却輕捷而俏皮地在維也納的背景前展演着。劇情是述一奥國軍官，愛上了賣花的維姫，他的父親大將軍却逼他娶女子爵。在訂婚的那夜，他拒絶了婚約，但戰事突發，他因爲立卽要赴前線，不及向她辭行，而引起她的誤會，以爲他已逼於父命而訂婚於女子爵。戰後，軍官失職了，開了一家皮鞋店，而維姫却成名於舞臺上。結果是免不了「有情人竟成眷屬。」</p>
<p>導演者赫伯威爾客斯，很有些細腻手腕，舉一個例　　像維姫在鞋店不認她的情郎，心裏是又愛又惱，以致例　着報紙，充分能表出一個心理矛盾的措亂情態。對白很聰明而風趣；音樂和歌曲也非常得力地　托着劇情，衹是「知音者」才能充分欣賞吧？</p>
<p>受過美國影業的洗禮的賈克卜淦南，有許多俏皮的動作，活潑的扮相，表現他的「英國希佛雷」的個性，的確他是給全片掙取功勳的一個。女主角是安娜妮格爾（Anna　Neagle）。</p>
<h3>光陸紅粉飄零（Ｓtrange　Interlude）</h3>
<p>— 燦爛</p>
<p>米高美的片子到光陸映的太少了。這一張紅粉飄零Strange　Ｉntenlude不但是米高美出品，而且還是世構之一。這片子是打開了有聲的新局面，創成了空前的紀錄。因爲牠已經變成舞臺劇的先驅者了。除去極多的對白以外，每一個劇中人的思想丨丨自忖丨丨都用言語來説明，配以適當表演，眞是澈底的使觀衆明瞭一切。本來「語爲心聲」現在居然「心聲」用語來表白，由這張片子爲始，恐怕將來很多的片子要走這一條新途徑。當然對於英文不能了了的人，是吃虧很大的。劇情係述二十餘年來的事，步步的推進。精彩完全在表演上的深刻動人。瑙瑪希拉Norma　Shearer,由少女而少婦，而中年婦人，而至於老嫗，隨時有適當的表演身份。這是她絶大的成功。克拉克　Clark　Cable也不是容易飾的角色。作風方面，也有所改換，配角中以羅勃特楊Robert　Young最好一點。</p>
<h3>國泰聯合車站（Ｕnion　Depor）</h3>
<p>— 愛蓮</p>
<p>小范朋克在去年尙無甚起色，今年一張「戰地之愛」却給他造成了燦爛的前途。第一國家最近的「聯合車站」中他飾一個小扒手，表演上他的確是可造之材，特别在戀愛片段的作工。同時片中很注意着貧民的流浪生活，非常適當，而且描寫得也算忠實。下層的生活在現在經濟社會下，都能呌人有深刻的印象。導演很好，他有「到民間去」的經騐和思想。攝影光線都可取。全片緊凑，剪接得法，換幕也清晰，配角很齊整。劇情平常，不過有很好的藝術成功，總是値得一看的。</p>
<h3>卡爾登甜情熱愛（Hot　Heiress）</h3>
<p>— 燕南</p>
<p>甜情熱愛係描寫無階級戀愛的喜劇，同時對於有產的門楣束缚和無產的勞工神聖，都有「有意識」的表露。情理上不能圓滿的事，偏使牠完滿，未免有當戲做之譏。穿挿還好，對白不十分多，而常常有小小的滑稽口吻或表演。配角除去有滑稽可喜的之外，就都很平常。彭里昂Ben　Lyon和其他演員都很賣力。不過爲了劇本的限制，似乎不能盡展所長。佈景可算偉大。鏡頭地位和配光，都有可看之處。總之，如果你嗜好戀愛片，那末這是不錯的片子，很能適合靑年情侶的口味。</p>
<h3>光華忠愛與骨肉</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>趕到光華，買票進門，哦！熱閙得很，到處是人，大槪有一百多吧。於是我很舒服的等着開映，兩邊都有空位，正好放置衣帽，而且大可以擱起脚來睡一會兒。</p>
<p>在一陣怪聲之後，我的情緒緊張起來，果然，戀愛與骨肉開映了。活動人影不停的一幕一幕的流過，我糊糊塗塗，不知所之，大槪是到了十八層地獄。其後在一陣掌聲中我驚醒了轉來，原來我在做着噩夢啊。我想：這個片子大槪好得太可以了吧，不然那裏會有這麽多的小孩子在鼓掌呢？</p>
<p>「這裏悶氣得很，還是回去罷，我打定主意，便離開座位，只聽得耳邊有誰在説：</p>
<p>「等」會兒罷，還有「千奇百怪」的「肚皮笑痛哩。」</p>
<p>然而在這「國難當頭」，我没有笑的興　，</p>
<p>當我大搖大擺快要走出影塲的時候，又聽得一個工人模樣的人在和另一人説：</p>
<p>「這是戀愛與骨頭。······」</p>
<p>走回家來，看一遍説明書，原來是這麽一個故事！</p>

<h3>孽海雙鴛</h3>
<p>— 菁</p>
<p>天一公司一九三二年的偉大傑作『孽海雙鴛』將在最近期間在本埠開映了。『孽海雙鴛』是一部對於遺產的流毒，有極深刻的描寫與明確的指示。</p>
<p>我們知道，在私有財產制度下的社會，金錢的罪惡，是多麽利害！你看那班擁有整千整萬的財產的富翁，他們不日將在南京大戲院開映『殘生』一片中的華納裴士德ＷarnerDaxterin　Ｓix　Hours　to　Kive合演者有約翰鮑爾士，美琳嬌登。此片係福斯公司佳構之一不是拿着金錢的勢力來壓迫和眩耀大多數的窮人！他們很少數能夠慷慨解囊拿出錢來做公益的事，他們最大的願望和目的，就是把所有的私產遺蔭他們的子弟，以致他們死後，體還未冷，家庭間已起了巨大怪劇，兄弟姊妹，爲了遺產分配不均，鬩墻操戈，對簿公庭，這種醜態，我們時時在報紙上是可以看到的·天一公司的『孽海雙鴛』就是針對這一點來描寫的。</p>
<p>這部片的佈景湯曉丹君，他是一個對於美術十分有修養的少年美術家。片中的一幕富翁的家庭，佈置得十分唐皇美麗，據説費了十多天工夫和千金以上的金錢。還有花園·月亮，也有極精心佈置的玲瓏細巧，開天一公司從來未有的新紀錄。</p>
<p>另外，我們還要注意的，就是女主角邵素霞，她是天一公司的協理邵邨人先生的女公子，年紀雖然是很小，但是演來倒還不錯，在過去的默片中，我們已經看見她活潑潑的像隻小鳥般的表演。這片是她主演有聲片的處女作。</p>

<h3>火柴大王本事（三）</h3>
<p>— 希孟霹</p>
<p>保羅不慌不忙地從衣袋掏出了一隻戒指，替蓓蓓套在手指上。他磁石似的眼睛，深深地望進蓓蓓的眼睛，低聲而鄭重地説道：「這個戒指，是我母親的遺物。我願你將牠戴了，一直到……」他推開她，好像愛情燃燒到不可忍耐的程度似的。停了一停，他又説道「我們趕快些吧。火車離開車，祇有一點鐘了。我在地蓬車站等你，你收抬好了就來，相會在問事處的前面。不久我們就要首途到加利福尼亞去了。親愛的，快去吧。」他一掦手，招了一輛汽車，扶她上了車。她呢，眼睛目不轉瞬地看住了那隻戒指，眼眶裏包滿了一眶快樂之涙，一言不發的上車去了。保羅等到車去遠了，又招了一輛汽車。</p>
<p>「到中央車站去，」他傲然的吩咐那車夫。「現在還有十四分鐘，我要去趕紐約的火車，還趕得上麽？」</p>
<p>「上來吧，先生，」車夫説「包你可以趕得上。」</p>
<p>保羅毫不遲疑地上了車。他對於蓓蓓發現了她受欺騙遺　之後，所受的　　痛苦，以及老工頭發現了他存欵被竊，蓓蓓性命的危險，都不在他心上。他到了紐約，僅僅有製辦新裝的工夫。他添製了許多套華服，購買了多少上等的行李，就乘　　瑞典去了。</p>
<p>霍姆泰德火柴公司的公事房，設在一個極小而佈置得極簡陋的一間房子裏。公司裏的董事，除掉愛立克之外，統通係中年的小資產家，他們都以鄕下老的誠摰，歡迎保羅克魯爾的重返故鄕。他們都受了保羅個性的吸引以及雄辯的征服，同意於保羅所主張的與别家火柴公司合併，以求資本週轉的靈活，利息的穩厚。但愛立克獨持保　的態度，並不似旁人的熱烈深信。此外還有一個銀行家，呌賴森的，是個矮小而精明的人，他對於保羅的計劃深加懷疑，因爲依照保羅的計劃，公司合併之後，同時銀行還要垫出一萬克魯納（瑞典幣名）的欵子，同保羅在美國所有的一切事業爲擔保。後來愛立克和賴森終究爲董事會的大多數所克　，而合併的計劃就此通過。賴森私下計算要訪查訪查這位驚人的保羅克魯爾先生在美國究意作多大的事業。所以董事會散會了，賴森就緊緊跟在保羅的後面了。</p>
<p>「保羅，」賴森很誠挚而帶懷疑的問，「你明明知道你今天簽的字還不値簽字的墨水！你在美國毫無所有，你無論在什麽地方，都係一個窮光蛋！一年以前，我到美國去，你看見了我求我到了故鄕，對於我在美國的生活，一字不提。現在你回來了，就用欺騙的手段，將我們的公司任意處分。這是與我們公司的前途極有危險的。這亦是我分内之事，我必須······</p>

<p>(Peiping) The Japanese 8th Division from Jinxi is arriving in Yuguan in an endless stream. On the night of the 7th, three trains of Japanese soldiers arrived in Yuguan, fully loaded with munitions and ammunition. They are being transported to the barracks of the four artillery forts in the South Sea. Division Commander Suzuki is residing in the old residence of 田中玉 on Erdao Street in the city. The Chaihuashi Artillery Regiment is constructing a fort on the Xiguan city wall. The majority of the residents within the city are fleeing around the outside of the South Gate to Taidao. There are two Japanese warships in Qindao, the rest have sailed to Yingkou and Dalian. (Eighth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) The 9th Brigade is firmly defending the front line of the Shihe River. Three lines of defense have been established between the Shihe River and a certain place. Japanese planes fly to the position daily for reconnaissance and bombing. Our troops have dug trenches over a Zhang deep, and the soldiers are in the trenches day and night, eagerly awaiting orders to counterattack. The area around Shimenzhai and Liutai is currently defended by our troops, and the defenses are solid. (Eighth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) A Japanese plane flew to Haiyangzhen this morning at 10:00 and dropped two bombs, one exploding inside the town, and one falling in the fields outside the town without exploding. It then flew to Qindao for a week of reconnaissance, flew east over the Shihe River, and returned. Because Japanese planes have repeatedly dropped bombs in the countryside, the villagers are extremely panicked, and many are abandoning their homes and fleeing. (Eighth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) The initial stage of the Japanese invasion of Yuguan involved pressuring our troops to the west bank of the 灤 River, after which they plan to attack Rehe. If our side resists with force, Japan is prepared to deploy the 5th Division, with the 3rd Division harassing Peiping and Tianjin, and the 2nd Division attacking Rehe. They are actively advancing troops. (Eighth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) A regiment of field artillery from the Suzuki 8th Division fired on our Shimenzhai position again late on the night of the 7th, and stopped shortly thereafter. Our troops are firmly defending in the trenches, and the defenses are solid. At 9:00 on the morning of the 8th, the enemy sent three more planes to bomb Haiyangzhen several times before leaving. The morale of our troops on the front line is very high. (Eighth Dispatch)</p>
<p>The situation on the front line of Linyu has not changed as of the 8th. Both sides are still facing each other across the Shihe River. According to a field investigation by someone from Yuguan city, the current Japanese military strength in Yuguan is the 4th Infantry Brigade and one artillery regiment belonging to Suzuki. He Zhuguo went to the front to inspect the position in the morning, and gave a speech to the soldiers, returning to the headquarters in the evening. The front-line fortifications are solid, and morale is high. (Eighth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) There was no fighting in Shihe on the 8th. Three enemy planes flew to our position for reconnaissance in the morning, but did not drop bombs. The Suzuki Brigade troops advancing north from Yucheng attacked Jiukou and Shimenzhai on the evening of the 7th. The situation at Jiukou is unclear. (Eighth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) According to news from foreigners outside Yuguan, there were occasional sounds of artillery fire at 6:30 this morning, but everything is peaceful. It is now confirmed that there are a total of 6,000 Japanese troops in Yuguan, and they are currently busy building defensive works around the city and fort. According to news from Tianjin, Japanese Commander Nakamura in North China stated that if the Chinese 16th and 19th Divisions entering Rehe do not stop advancing within a few days, they will be bombed by aircraft. US Ambassador Johnson denies the rumors from Tokyo that he is willing to mediate and that the two sides will open negotiations on the Yuguan case. (Eighth Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Because the Japanese army has mobilized a large number of troops and deployed them throughout Jinzhou, Suizhong, Yuguan, and Qinhuangdao, the war clouds in North China have become tense again in recent days. This morning, the Japanese command in Tianjin told foreign reporters that the continuous mobilization of the Japanese army, navy, and air force is intended to monitor the movements of Zhang Xueliang's troops, and there is no intention of invading China. Japan is exhausting all kinds of sophistry in an attempt to deceive the world. (Eighth Chinese United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) After the Japanese army invaded Yuguan, it sent a large number of puppet party 협화회 propagandists to Yuguan to incite the public to organize a local people's government, attempting to incorporate it into the puppet organization's territory in order to achieve its aggressive ambitions. (Eighth Chinese United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Bao Wen talks, having arrived in Beijing, as of the morning of the 8th, he has not yet received 平方's telegram regarding the war situation in the Qinhuangdao and Shihe areas. The fighting is probably not very intense. However, he believes that if the Japanese army invades again, our army will definitely resist to the end. (Eighth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) More than 120 Shanghai student volunteers have arrived in Peiping, led by团长 Li Xiangheng. Tonight, they will go to Yuyu East to participate in the resistance against Japan. (Eighth Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Warships in Qinhuangdao Take No Aggressive Action</h3>
<p>British Ship Captain Visits He Zhuguo to Propose Mediation</p>
<p>He Indicates He Only Knows How to Defend Territory and Cannot Accept</p>
<p>Five Japanese warships have arrived in Linyu and Qinhuangdao, one after the other. They are currently taking no aggressive action. Our troops are on high alert, and the area is peaceful. (Eighth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) The British ship captain of a Japanese warship in Qinhuangdao landed on the 7th and visited He Zhuguo, proposing to mediate. He replied that the Yuguan matter is not a local incident and cannot be resolved through negotiations on local issues. Your goodwill should be discussed directly with the central government. As a military officer, I only know how to defend the territory and cannot accept. (Eighth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Qinhuangdao is as peaceful as ever. Two Japanese warships are still stationed off the coast of the island, and there are no changes. (Eighth Dispatch)</p>

In order to protect the lives and property of British nationals, he has been in close contact with the commanders of both Chinese and Japanese forces, and it is hoped that through his mediation, the two sides may be able to hold a meeting. (Eighth Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Generals from All Sides Telegraph the Capital Requesting to Volunteer</h3>
<p>Feng Yuxiang Asks Yan XiShan of Shanxi to Assist Zhang with All His Strength</p>
<p>Song Zheyuan Goes to Yangquan to Manage Defense Affairs</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After the Japanese invasion of Yuguan, generals from all sides telegraphed the capital requesting to volunteer. Chairman Chiang has replied to each of them to commend and console them, and ordered them to earnestly reorganize their subordinates and await orders quietly. During this critical period, vigilance must be strictly maintained in the defense area to prevent reactionaries from taking the opportunity to rise up. (Eighth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Feng Yuxiang, in Zhangjiakou, was extremely angry when he heard that the Japanese army was about to occupy Peiping and Tianjin. He has telegraphed someone from his old subordinates, expressing his willingness to join forces with all parties to resist Japan, and has also shown his strategy. He also telegraphed Yan, asking him to assist Zhang in resisting Japan with all his strength. (Eighth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Liu Zhenhua telegraphed Hankou on the 8th, saying that the Japanese bandits are extremely ferocious and have invaded our Yuguan. Zhenhua, as a soldier, has ordered his troops to be ready and is willing to be the vanguard in resisting the enemy. (Eighth Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Peiping) Song Zheyuan told reporters at the station that the Yuguan incident has aroused anger throughout the country. This army has telegraphed the central government and Zhang, volunteering to sacrifice for the country and fight the enemy. He intends to first go to Yangquan and then to other places to give speeches to the officers and soldiers of this army, so that the soldiers can recognize the enemy and fight desperately. He will return to Peiping in a week. Before leaving Peiping, Song had already telegraphed Zhang Zizhong and Feng Zhi'an, the two divisions stationed on the Zhengtai Line, to prepare everything. Bao Gang and Liu Ruming, stationed in Qin County and Fenyang, are all willing to sacrifice for the country. Pang Bingdong expressed that his troops are determined to resist Japan. He will not return to his defense area for the time being and will remain in Peiping to await orders. (Eighth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhao Pilian told reporters on the 8th that all the generals and soldiers in Shanxi were outraged by the Japanese invasion of Yuguan. Yan Xishan also believed that North China was in a critical situation and was willing to lead the Shanxi army to cooperate in resisting the enemy. Yan will eliminate the old and weak and conduct strict training for the Shanxi army. It has seven infantry divisions, one artillery cavalry, and one independent brigade, totaling more than 100,000 people. In addition to pacifying the local area, several divisions can be dispatched to serve the country. He also said that Princes De and He of Inner Mongolia came to Beijing to make the central government aware of the situation on the Mongolian border. In the future, a Mongolian army will be organized to consolidate the border and resist the violent Japanese, so that the central government can have no worries about the north. (Eighth Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Tan Daoyuan, Commander of the 22nd Army, Yue Sen, Commander of the 50th Division, and Zhu Yaohua, Commander of the 18th Division, came to Beijing to attend the dedication ceremony of the tomb of the late President Tan. They went to the military academy on the 8th to pay respects to Chiang and request to volunteer to kill the enemy. (Eighth Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chiang Asks Luo Wengan to Go to Tangshan to Discuss the Yuguan Matter</h3>
<p>A Certain Central Committee Member Says the Only Solution is Resistance</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chiang entered the city from Tangshan on the 7th. After meeting with various military officials, he went to Tangshan again that night to rest, and asked Luo Wengan to go to Tangshan on the 8th to discuss the Yuguan incident. He is scheduled to return to the city on the morning of the 9th to attend the inauguration ceremony of the President of the Legislative Yuan and the dedication ceremony of the tomb of the late President Tan. (Eighth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain reporter asks a certain central committee member, What is the purpose of the Japanese army's invasion of Yuguan? The first step is to acquire Rehe, and the second step is to make puppets enter the pass. What is the central government's response to the Japanese army's invasion of Yuguan? The only solution is resistance. There is no other way. Does the central government have a comprehensive plan for military and other necessary preparations? The central government has long had in-depth calculations, but resistance against Japan cannot rely solely on military affairs. Other financial, transportation, and the organization of the people themselves, all citizens must have the determination to sacrifice for the nation and be prepared to go to the front line at all times. The military and political authorities in various places should immediately be aware of this, break the separatist situation, eliminate all internal conflicts, and unify under the command of the central government. Only then can a great force be generated externally and long-term resistance can be carried out. It is heard that Japan has plans to further harass Peiping, Tianjin, and our important coastal commercial ports. Is this true? The government has not received this report, but it is expected that Japan, although barbaric, would not dare to take this risk. It is reported that Britain and Japan have a secret agreement in the Far East, and Britain will not interfere with Japan's actions in invading China. Is this true? This news was transmitted from Washington, and Britain has denied it. Based on my speculation, Britain will not do this. (Eighth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain important person said that Japan's armed invasion of our Yuguan during the recess of the League of Nations is tantamount to challenging the League of Nations. Therefore, the League of Nations should convene an early meeting at this time and quickly seek an appropriate solution. Otherwise, the prestige of the League of Nations will be degraded by Japan alone, and all international sacred treaties will be torn up by Japan alone. In the future, all peace guarantees between countries will be lost, and the future conflicts in the world will be unimaginable. The disarmament conference will be just empty talk. (Eighth Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Zhang Sends Representatives to Taiyuan</h3>
<h3>Report on the Yuguan Incident</h3>
<p>(Taiyuan) Zhang Xueliang's representative Liu Weiyong came to Taiyuan on the 7th and stayed at the Zhengda Hotel. He visited Yan that night. Liu told reporters that he came to meet Yan on behalf of Zhang to report on the Yuguan incident and the countermeasures against Japan. Chiang, Yan, and other generals have telegraphed Zhang, urging him to resist with force. Regarding military steps against Japan, Yan and others have expressed that they will await orders from the central government. Yuguan is currently in a temporary ceasefire, and Peiping and Tianjin are still peaceful. The generals who stayed in Peiping have returned to their defense areas to reorganize their troops. 楬愛源 hosted a banquet for Liu at his residence on the evening of the 8th, inviting various generals to accompany him to discuss military affairs against Japan. Sun Dianying and his deputy commander Jin Zunhua returned to Taiyuan from Peiping on the 7th, and returned to their original defense in Jincheng on the morning of the 8th. (Eighth Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Zhu Qinglan Expresses Continued Resistance to the Enemy</h3>
<p>Telegraphs All Parties to Donate Funds and Contribute Efforts</p>
<p>(Peiping) Zhu Qinglan issued a circular from Peiping, stating that the Yuguan and Rehe alerts are frequent, and the national crisis is becoming more and more serious. If the whole country does not unite to resist foreign aggression, there is no way to survive. Economic materials are needed in large quantities. Please, compatriots at home and abroad, rise up together, donate funds and contribute efforts to save the country. (Eighth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Zhu Qinglan issued a circular stating, All newspaper offices, please be aware that since the loss of the Northeast, more than a year has passed. Justice has not been served, and violence has become even worse. Slaughter and plunder have been extremely cruel. Throughout history, those who have destroyed countries have done so in order to profit from their land and people. Now, they have not only occupied our land, but also recklessly ravaged it. They will not stop until they have driven out all of our compatriots to achieve their goal of annexation. Their conspiracies are extremely vicious. Unexpectedly, the civilization of the 20th century actually tolerates this public enemy of mankind. Our country, after enduring for so long, has had to seek a way to defend itself. In recent years, the people's volunteers have resisted with determination, and patriots have filled the ravines. Again and again, they have fallen forward and risen again. To this day, the living have no homes and the dead have not been buried. Who is responsible for this catastrophe? They recklessly disregard this and become even more blatant. They started a war on New Year's Day and attacked our Yuguan. On Jiang's Day, they launched a fierce attack on our stationed troops with land, sea, and air forces, causing countless innocent residents to be killed and injured. The alarms on the Rehe border are also frequent, and the national crisis is alarming. How can this be tolerated? I previously received support from compatriots at home and abroad, who shared the same hatred for the enemy and donated to the volunteer army. I am extremely grateful for their small contributions. Qinglan has a rough understanding of the 易经 and has long had a sense of emptiness. At the age of sixty, what more can I hope for? However, with the great disaster at hand, it is difficult to stand by idly. I vow to unite the patriotic people and continue to struggle without interruption. As long as I have a breath left, this will will not change. Time is urgent, and it will pass quickly. At this critical moment of life and death, the country must unite to survive. Economic materials are needed in large quantities, which cannot be collected by one province or one region. All of my compatriots at home and abroad must rise up together, donate funds and exert their strength, and do their best. It must be known that protecting the country is protecting the home, and saving others is saving oneself. I shed tears as I make this statement, and I hope you will understand. Zhu Qinglan kowtows. (Eighth Dispatch)</p>
<h3>People Everywhere Are Extremely Angry About the Yuguan Incident</h3>

<p>(Xuzhou) All circles in Xuzhou are extremely indignant about the Yuguan incident. They have jointly telegraphed the central government, supporting the national government and asking Ping and Zhang to resist with all their strength. They have also sent separate telegrams to the generals in North China, urging them to seriously defend their territory and vow to resist Japan to the death, eliminate foreign bandits, and recover lost land. Follow in the blood of the Nineteenth Route Army and set an example for He Zhuguo's brigade, setting a model for soldiers and sacrificing their lives for the nation. Millions of Xuzhou people will provide material and logistical support. Various newspapers published extra editions during the holiday period, and social and educational organizations also mobilized.

<h3>Suizhong Puppet Police Revolt</h3>

<p>The Puppet Fengshan Road Transportation Is Severed</p>
<p>(Peiping) Since the Japanese army attacked Yuguan, more than 100 puppet police in Suizhong, angered by the oppression of the violent Japanese, revolted as a whole and attacked the Japanese army stationed in Suizhong. On the evening of the 2nd, they demolished a section of the railway tracks of the puppet Fengshan Road in Suizhong, and the transportation on the puppet Fengshan Road was severed for a time. It was previously reported that the demolition of the railway was done by Zheng Guilin's troops, but it was actually done by the revolted puppet police.

<p>Zhang Xueliang Hosts Peiping Press</p>
<p>丨Makes a Statement丨</p>
<p>The Yuguan Incident Is the Same as the September 18th Incident</p>
<p>Returning Yuguan Can Solve the Issue Peacefully</p>
<p>The Only Way to Deal with Japanese Atrocities Is to Fight with Flesh and Blood</p>
<p>I Am a Weak Person in China and Not Worthy of Attention</p>
<p>(Peiping) Zhang Xueliang hosted Chinese and foreign reporters at his private residence at 11:00 this morning and made a statement, saying that after the September 18th Incident, the central government and he himself, in order to maintain world peace with years of effort by the League of Nations, both wanted to resolve the matter peacefully. This kind of act by Japan to destroy peace was only done by a few ambitious people, causing the international peace movement to be in vain. The Yuguan Incident was caused by the Japanese side using the excuse of China transporting troops. The Japanese army can run rampant in China, but Chinese troops cannot be mobilized within their own country. How can this be justified? The Japanese excused the Yuguan Incident by saying that our country opened fire first, which is the same as the September 18th Incident. There are facts to prove it. When the investigation team passed through Yuguan, the Japanese side raised the puppet flag high at the station. The members of the team said that the Japanese people in Yuguan had the possibility of free action. Zhang said that the Japanese used unilaterally favorable treaties, or treaties that have been abolished, to act freely, and used stationed troops to provoke us. If there were no Japanese troops stationed in Yuguan, how could this unfortunate incident have occurred? If the Japanese army returns Yuguan to China, the Yuguan Incident can be resolved peacefully. The only way to deal with Japanese atrocities is to fight with flesh and blood to maintain justice. Only with hot blood can it be done. If Japan repents, peace will appear immediately. The Japanese side often sees Zhang as an obstacle and wants to remove him. In fact, I am a weak person in China and not worthy of attention. Zhang also replied to a certain foreign reporter, saying that the Japanese side has not yet proposed negotiations. Even if they want to negotiate, they must formally proceed with the central government. Whether China has the determination to resist depends on whether the Japanese side has the intention to repent. (Eighth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Zhang Xueliang received about 60 Chinese and foreign reporters this morning. Zhang looked very healthy, but he was tired. When asked if Zhang's policy was to resist to the end, Zhang replied that this depends on whether Japan's policy is to attack to the end. Zhang said that he has always advocated a peaceful resolution to the Sino-Japanese dispute, because the current state is not beneficial to either China or Japan. If the war develops, it will be even more unfavorable to both countries. Protecting the country is an unquestionable responsibility, but have we forgotten the lessons of the world war? Are we going back to the state of the wild? Are all the world's ideologies and efforts to achieve peace all ineffective? It is important to know that the whole world is still working for peace today, and even Japan is talking about peace. However, the past and present actions of the Japanese can prove whether their talk of peace is sincere. Zhang then spoke about the provocation, saying that the Japanese army can now act freely, but when China mobilizes troops within its own country, Japan immediately calls it a provocation. Isn't this a joke? It's like someone hiring someone to guard them for fear of being kidnapped, and the kidnapper can't say, You're provoking me. The responsibility for the Yuguan case does not lie in the question of who fired first, but must be viewed in terms of the results and the original cause. Now Yuguan has been razed to the ground, and countless people have been killed. The beginning of the Yuguan case, like the September 18th case, may require another investigation team to investigate its cause. The only purpose of today's matter is that Manchuria and Yuguan must be returned to China. One of Japan's excuses for occupying Manchuria is to oppose one person, Zhang Xueliang. If Japan is now occupying a part of China's land to oppose this person, then this person must be an important figure. He is truly grateful, but if the solution to this dispute hinges on the presence or absence of one person, then the matter is easy to handle. Some say that Japan cannot lose face, so for the sake of face, it cannot abolish the puppet state. As for China, it does not regard this as a matter of face, but as a matter of life and death. How can we achieve this goal now? We must give everything to protect our lives and the existence of our country. It is expected that Japan will continue to protest, because we have now expressed our intention to fight, and the Japanese will accuse us of provoking them. But war is an example given to us by the Japanese. China has endured for a long time and has not fought, but has not achieved any results. Some people in Japan advocate peace, but have not achieved any results. The League of Nations and the world advocate peace, but it has not been effective. The only way for us to achieve our goal is to avoid war, but we don't know what Japan's goal is. If it is for Zhang Xueliang alone, it will not be difficult to deal with, but I am afraid that its goal is the essence and blood of China, which we cannot tolerate. When asked what kind of assistance foreign countries should give to China, Zhang replied that foreign friends can announce the facts to the Japanese people who are now blinded by propaganda, because it is not true that the Japanese are completely unreasonable or that they all have evil thoughts. However, there is no reason for optimism today. Although the overall situation is very dark, the truth and justice will eventually prevail. Zhang said at the end that he and the Japanese side are not currently engaged in negotiations, and the Japanese side has not made this request. If negotiations are needed, they must be handled by the central government. (Eighth Reuters Dispatch)</p>

It is said that a general offensive will be launched as soon as Zhang arrives at the front. Also, it is reported that Li Haifeng's division engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy near Mengjiatun, killing many enemy rebels. The enemy is very hostile to Li's division and has deployed heavy troops to suppress Li's division, intending to eliminate Li's division first and then eliminate other volunteer armies.

<h3>Japan Dispatches Major General Umezu</h3>

However, the Chinese side's anti-Japanese attitude is becoming increasingly severe, making the future difficult to predict. After a meeting of the top leadership, it was decided to urgently dispatch Major General Umezu, the Director of the General Affairs Department of the General Staff Headquarters, to the Tianjin area.

<h3>Current Commentary</h3>
<h3>How Will 1933 Pass?</h3>
<p>The current stage of economic panic is unprecedented under the existing system. This is an undeniable fact. Whether it will be the last is still questionable. However, the infant of socialism has already been born with the establishment of Soviet power. The metabolism of the new and old social systems has already begun. History tells us that all epochal evolutions and all system changes cannot have clear-cut boundaries. It is like the intermingling of life and death. One cannot expect the old to die completely in a certain month or the young to be born completely in a certain year. However, in general, the beginning of the socialist era in history can be regarded as the approaching end of the capitalist era. However, the ways and timing of individual collapses vary.</p>
<p>Before the development of commercial capital, the so-called panic in the economic society was a famine caused by insufficient production. Due to the increase in population, this panic of insufficient production intensified with each cycle of panic, thereby promoting the end of the agricultural handicraft era in economic history. Since the 19th century, mechanical inventions and the gradual development of capitalism have swept away almost all past panics of insufficient production. However, what has replaced it is the opposite panic of overproduction. This panic of overproduction intensifies with each cycle due to the ever-changing nature of mechanical inventions. Its eventual promotion of the death of the capitalist era is almost an inevitable trend. All systems in the world have their epochal value. Capitalism has been advancing production and benefiting society since the end of the agricultural handicraft era and when materials were extremely scarce. Its current state of decline and turmoil is due to the contradictions within its system, which have fallen into an irreconcilable situation. In other words, the current productivity can no longer be applied to the current distribution methods. Regarding this point, we can make it extremely clear if we give an extreme example. This extreme example assumes that the invention of machinery is sufficient to save all labor. Then, in terms of the employment relationship under the current system, is it not that the entire working class has fallen into unemployment? Furthermore, in terms of the distribution methods under the current system, is it not that the entire working class will fall into starvation? Therefore, at this time, if these production tools with great productivity are still privately owned by some private individuals, it is tantamount to humankind relying entirely on nature for survival in primitive times, and the creator suddenly comes out to monopolize all natural resources. The monopolists will inevitably fall into oversupply, and the general public will inevitably fall into hunger and cold. Its impassability is already obvious. The current state is still not as extreme as this extreme example. However, the enjoyment allocated to the working class must be far less than the results of their production. This is the principle that should exist under capitalism. If we assume that with the current productivity, the working class working five hours a day is sufficient to supply the needs of society, then in terms of the current usual eight-hour work system, in order to avoid unemployment for workers, the world must have three-eighths of overproduction. Conversely, if we want to avoid overproduction, the world must have three-eighths of unemployed labor. This contradiction cannot be reconciled without reforming the current distribution system. This is why we recognize that capitalism is at its end. And the world in 1933 may be the turning point in the era.</p>
<p>In this era of great change in 1933, how will China change? The experience of the past year has clearly shown us that as the world panic becomes more and more profound, it is when imperialism intensifies its aggression against China. The panic of the strong must be passed on to the weak. Therefore, the increase in difficulties and hardships in China in 1933 is probably an unavoidable fact. What we can take comfort in is that the increase in all conflicts and contradictions under the current system is a symbol of the coming of a new era. In this stage of removing the old and renewing, we may be able to reduce the current pain with the hope for the new era. What we must be more aware of is that all the pleasures in the world must be sought through sacrifice and struggle. Difficulties and hardships are the price for the advent of a new era. We only need to recognize that the individual is only a part of society and that the current era is only a stage in history. Then, as long as society can see the light, the sacrifice of the individual is not worth caring about. As long as the entire history continues to move upward, the hardships of the current stage should be faced with equanimity. The most painful and pitiful things in the world are meaningless sacrifices and worthless hardships. The meaning of sacrifice is clear, and the value of hardship is determined, then we should sing and advance and rise up to fight to the death with the invading countries. The anti-imperialist struggle of colonies and semi-colonies is the last resort in the current era. Then, we must unite and rise up and fight hand-to-hand to overcome the current difficulties so that this distressing stage will come to an end suddenly. The dawn has been seen, and the future is bright. May our countrymen encourage each other.</p>

<p>=French Ambassador to Japan Departs to Return to Tokyo, Said to Be Related to the Yuguan Incident=</p>
<p>(Nanjing) It is still difficult to speculate on whether the news from the Japanese press about a secret agreement between Britain and France with Japan is true. Our country received this information a month ago, but in order to safeguard international etiquette, we did not want to make explicit statements. We also hope that this theory is inaccurate, because the economic positions of Britain and France in China have become increasingly consolidated in recent times. If they are wise, they would not make such a counterproductive move. However, since the news was transmitted from the United States, the diplomatic authorities of Britain and France have never made a clear and definite denial, which cannot but leave people in doubt. (Special Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Parisian daily, "Liberte," reported today that France intends to notify Japan that the French government believes that Japan should be held responsible for the conflict between the Chinese and Japanese armies in Yuguan since New Year's Day. It also said that French Prime Minister Pang Gu had met with Ambassador to Japan, Martiel, who will soon return to his post. According to this theory, it has not yet been confirmed. Although there is much discussion about it, informed sources do not believe it. It is speculated that France will not express its position before the League of Nations convenes to discuss it.

Reuters has learned that a certain French newspaper's report that Ambassador Martiel has been instructed to speak clearly to the Japanese Foreign Ministry about the Shanhaiguan incident is not true. It is heard that France's policy is still the policy of the League of Nations. It is found that Martiel has much experience in Far Eastern affairs. Before being transferred to Tokyo, he served as First Secretary and Minister in the Legation in Beiping for many years. (Reuters Telegram, 7th)</p>
<h3>Content of the Draft Resolution with Opinion Letter of the League of Nations' Special Committee of Nineteen</h3>
<p>(Geneva) This morning, a certain newspaper published the opinion letter and resolution of the Special Committee of Nineteen. The opinion letter is as follows: (1) The General Assembly of the League of Nations, based on the resolution of December 9, ordered the special committee (A) to review the report of the Commission of Inquiry and the opinion letters of both parties, as well as the opinions and suggestions expressed in the General Assembly, regardless of the manner in which they were submitted; (B) to draft a resolution with a view to resolving the dispute submitted to the committee in accordance with the resolution of the Executive Yuan of February 19, 1922; (C) to submit this recommendation to the General Assembly in the shortest possible time; (2) If the committee believes that it is necessary to submit the truth of the incident and the review of the overall situation to the General Assembly as a whole, it must draw on the first eight chapters of the Commission of Inquiry's report to write this article. In the eyes of the committee, these eight chapters are a fair and complete expression of the main facts; (3) But now is not the time to prepare this article, because according to Article 15, Section 3 of the Covenant of the League of Nations, the General Assembly has the responsibility to first use mediation to find a solution to the dispute. If it is effective, the facts and explanations of the dispute, as well as the provisions of this solution, should be published as appropriate. If it is ineffective, it is necessary to prepare and issue a report in accordance with Section 4 of the same article, explaining the facts of the dispute and the recommendations that the Executive Yuan considers fair and appropriate; (4) When efforts under Section 3 are still in progress, the feelings of the General Assembly, which belong to the various changes predicted by the Covenant of the League of Nations, must be given a special degree of reservation. Therefore, the draft resolution submitted by the committee to the General Assembly today is mainly based on the proposal of mediation; (5) The Special Committee is ordered by the General Assembly's resolution of March 11 to do its utmost to prepare for the resolution of the dispute and the agreement between the two parties. However, the participation of the United States and the Soviet Union can be beneficial. Therefore, it strives to cooperate with the representatives of the two countries and suggests that the two governments be invited to participate in the negotiations; (6) In order to avoid any misunderstandings and to show that mediation is used exclusively for negotiations to seek a solution, and to suggest cooperation with the two countries that are not members of the League of Nations, and to engage in the current situation, the committee specially recommends that the committee should be changed to a new committee ordered to handle negotiations, and authorizes the committee to invite the governments of the United States and Russia to participate in the meeting; (7) The negotiation committee may exercise the powers necessary to carry out its orders and may consult experts. If it is deemed necessary, it may delegate part of its powers to one or several members, or to one or several persons with special qualifications. When the members of the committee encounter legal problems in the negotiations, they shall abide by the first and second paragraphs of the General Assembly resolution of March 11, 1932. When encountering factual problems, they shall use the evidence in the first eight chapters of the Commission of Inquiry's report as the standard. As for the solution, it should be based on the principles listed in Chapter 9 of the Lytton Report and refer to the recommendations in Chapter 10 to find it; (9) Because the opinion of the Committee of Nineteen is that, in light of the special circumstances of the dispute, merely returning to the state before September 1931 is not sufficient to achieve a lasting solution, and maintaining and recognizing the current government of Manchuria cannot be regarded as a solution. (Reuters Telegram, 8th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The first draft resolution of the Committee of Nineteen is as follows: (1) Recalling the provisions of Article 15 of the Covenant of the League of Nations, its primary responsibility is to do its utmost to ensure the resolution of disputes, so it has recorded and announced the state of disputes and submitted a draft report on the method of resolution; (2) Establishing the principle of restraining the attitude of the League of Nations regarding the resolution of disputes in accordance with the resolution of February 11, 1932; (3) Confirming that this solution must respect the spirit of the Covenant of the League of Nations, the Paris Peace Pact, and the Nine-Power Treaty; (4) Deciding to organize a committee, entrusting it to handle negotiations with all parties, with a view to seeking a solution based on the principles listed in Chapter 9 of the Lytton Report and referring to the recommendations in Chapter 10; (5) Appointing the members of the Special Committee of Nineteen of the League of Nations to organize the committee; (6) Because the participation of the United States and Russia in the trial negotiations will be beneficial, the committee is ordered to invite the governments of the United States and Russia to participate in the negotiations; (7) Authorizing the committee to complete its task with the plans it deems necessary; (8) Inviting the committee to submit a report on its work before March 1, 1933; (9) Permitting the committee to have the right to agree with both parties on the extension period mentioned in the General Assembly resolution of August 1, 1932. When the two parties have not agreed on the extension period, the committee shall also submit recommendations to the General Assembly when it submits its report; (10) The President of the General Assembly may convene it at any time during the meeting when the chairman deems it necessary. The second draft resolution expresses its gratitude for the impartial and conscientious work of the Commission of Inquiry. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<h3>Japan's Counter-Propaganda Against the United States</h3>
<h3>Fabricates That China and Japan Have Begun Yuguan Negotiations</h3>
<h3>Hopes to Use It as a Delaying Tactic</h3>
<p>(Washington) Today, the U.S. State Department received a report from the U.S. Consul General in Tianjin that the Chinese and Japanese military officers in Shanhaiguan are negotiating a solution, and cited a report from the U.S. military inspector in Qinhuangdao that this negotiation began yesterday. Upon hearing this news, the Chinese Embassy here immediately issued a statement saying that the news of this negotiation was spread by the Japanese and is obviously a delaying tactic, intending to slow down China's defense plan and relax the hearts of the Chinese people. If the Chinese people believe in this kind of local news, they will inevitably slow down the increase in troops, so the Japanese can take the opportunity to concentrate reinforcements and go to the area. However, the Chinese people will resist any kind of invasion in the area. Today, the U.S. State Department also received extremely reliable news from the Chinese side that Zhang Xueliang and Chiang Kai-shek will meet in the middle of the Jinpu Railway to discuss countermeasures against the Japanese army's invasion of North China. (National Telegram, 7th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Recently, because the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs is actively manufacturing counter-propaganda in the United States, saying that the Yuguan Incident is purely a local issue and is currently in contact with Zhang Xueliang for a peaceful solution, our authorities inquired and telegraphed the embassy in the United States this morning, stating that the Yuguan case is entirely the first step of the Japanese army's invasion of North China. The Japanese warlords had a consistent plan beforehand and were by no means an accidental conflict. Our side absolutely cannot regard it as a local issue and has never prepared to contact the Japanese army with local issues. All the information spread by the Japanese in the United States is not true, but is a counter-propaganda effect commonly used by the Japanese. (China United Press, 8th)</p>
<h3>Glimpses of Opinions from Various Countries</h3>
<h3>China Does Not Forget Grudges</h3>
<p>(London) Laski, a famous professor of political science at Harvard University, recently published an article in the Socialist Party's "Daily People's Voice," discussing Gu Weijun, the Chinese representative to the League of Nations, and at the same time presenting Chinese politics and Far Eastern issues. Laski took this opportunity to severely criticize Japanese imperialism, saying that it will inevitably fail and eventually go bankrupt. Laski said that Gu represents the youth of China and can preserve the inherent spirit of the Chinese nation. Laski said, "China is not forgetful of kindness and grudges. It will avenge its enemies, just as it will repay its kindness." His conclusion also said that Japan is exhausted by the impact of the economic panic, but what it has done is tantamount to destroying the foundation of its imperialism. (Havas Telegram, 7th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Make Another Big Mistake</h3>
<p>(London) The British "Observer" published an editorial today criticizing the Yuguan case, saying that divine condemnation will descend on Japan from Japan. The harm suffered by China may be beneficial to China. Not occupying land outside the Great Wall is obviously the plan of the Japanese military commander, but this cannot hide the major mistakes of Japan's policy today, because the Japanese warships outside Yuguan now control the Chinese army west of the Great Wall. A year ago, the Japanese army bombarded Zhabei, making a big mistake. Now, they are driving artillery at the land of China in Bohai Bay, which is tantamount to repeating the Manchurian case once. No matter what difficulties there are, Japan should not have any activities in Shanhaiguan. This is undoubtedly true. Today, the best hope is still in direct negotiations between China and Japan, but I am afraid it is too late to do anything. (Reuters Telegram, 8th)</p>
<h3>Destroyer of Peace</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The German Republican "Frankfurter Zeitung" wrote an article on the Sino-Japanese issue, saying, "To this day, the true ambitions of the Japanese can no longer be concealed, nor can they be defended with legitimate reasons. It is well known that the Japanese regime has shifted from the civilian faction to the hands of the military." The newspaper commented on recent events, saying, "The Sino-Japanese dispute has entered a new stage from the perspective of Japanese policy. Japan's goal is to make Beiping the capital of North China and separate it from other parts of China. This method will inevitably lead to war. However, in the current situation, the war in the Far East does have the danger of causing a world war. Therefore, at this time, we should warn the Japanese to wake up and not advise China. If the Japanese want to promote a kind of Asian Monroe Doctrine with the slogan 'Asia belongs to Asians' in order to dominate the Far East, they should show that they are indeed the maintainers of law and order. However, based on the current facts, Japan cannot live up to this reputation, and even Japan's best friends cannot distort the facts to defend it," and so on. (Havas Telegram, 7th)</p>
<h3>Kellogg Non-War Theory</h3>
<p>Kellogg, the former prime minister of the United States who initiated the non-war pact in Kansas City, said here today that the conflict between the Chinese and Japanese armies in Shanhaiguan and other disturbances in Manchuria, if they had occurred ten years ago, would have caused open conflict between the world powers. Today, both sides are working hard to turn the Shanhaiguan incident into a local event, which is a clear effect after the powers have changed their attitudes.

<h3>Franco-Spanish Naval Secret Agreement</h3>
<p>French Newspapers Have Already Revealed Its Glimpse</p>
<p>Causing Repercussions Among Westerners</p>
<p>▲ Madrid dispatch from Guomin on the 7th: Former Italian newspapers widely reported that the French and Spanish governments were secretly discussing the construction of French naval bases on the western coast of the Mediterranean. French newspapers have now revealed a glimpse of it, which has caused repercussions among the Spanish people. Madrid's ABC and Debate reprinted a section of the French Paris Midi newspaper, stating that French Senator Malvy had set off for the Balearic Islands to investigate whether the islands have the status of a naval port for the construction of a French naval base. Furthermore, French newspapers reprinted a news item stating that a secret agreement between France and Spain was indeed established last October when former French President Herriot visited Spain. One of the most important sections of the agreement is that Spain will cede its African colony of Letworolo to France in exchange for France's Tangier overseas colony. This matter has particularly aroused the panic of the Spanish people. Debate newspaper criticized it as a despicable secret diplomacy and stated that it is very difficult to achieve before the consent of other powers.</p>
<h3>Japanese Political Undercurrents</h3>
<h3>Force Okada to Step Down</h3>
<p>Osumi to Succeed as Naval Minister</p>
<p>▲ China United News Agency Tokyo dispatch on the 8th: Although the Japanese government announced that Naval Minister Okada resigned due to illness, political circles believe that there is a great key involved in the political issue. There are two so-called political issues: 1. Many young naval officers believe that war with the United States is inevitable. In order to deal with the large U.S. Navy, it is necessary to actively improve military equipment and build a large number of battleships. However, Okada did not actively express this in the budget grabbing, and the naval budget funds have been deducted by the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<h3>Artificial Sunlight</h3>
<p>Can Make Flower Buds Bloom</p>
<p>▲ Havas Agency London dispatch on the 8th: According to the People's Daily, British scholars have recently made a very interesting invention, which is to create a machine that can emit light exactly the same as sunlight, but its power is harmless. This invention has been made a final test. If a flower that is about to bloom receives this light, it can be completely released in an instant.</p>
<p>Among the perpetrators of the May 15th Incident, the naval aspect was punished</p>
<p>It is also more serious than the army, which makes the opposition to Okada's negative attitude in the ministry even stronger. 2. The leader of the Seiyukai Party, stated that during the 63rd National Congress, Okada was entrusted by Prime Minister Saito to negotiate compromise matters with important members of the Seiyukai Party. Okada had secretly made an agreement with Minister of Culture Hatoyama, stating that the Saito cabinet would step down immediately after the closing of the National Congress and cede power to the Seiyukai Party. However, the agreement has not yet been realized, and Saito has changed his attitude and is preparing to stubbornly hold on to power. As a result, the Seiyukai Party is angry at Okada's breach of faith, which has led to an increasingly fierce conflict between the Seiyukai Party and the government. Therefore, Okada had no choice but to resign automatically to apologize to the Seiyukai Party. The reason for Okada's resignation lies here, which shows that the undercurrent of the Japanese political situation is fierce.</p>
<p>▲ China United News Agency Tokyo dispatch on the 8th: At 4:10 pm today, Prime Minister Saito visited Naval Minister Okada. Okada said that because of his illness, he decided to resign and recommended General Anbo or General Osumi Kōsenao as his successor as Naval Minister. Saito then visited the Chief of the Naval General Staff and Marshal Tōgō to discuss the successor as Naval Minister. It is heard that it has been decided to recommend General Osumi Kōsenao as the new Naval Minister. The inauguration ceremony will be held after the cabinet meeting tomorrow. It is reported that General Osumi Kōsenao is 56 years old this year. He was appointed as a naval second lieutenant in the 31st year of Meiji, as a rear admiral in the 9th year of Taisho, as a vice admiral in the 13th year, and as a general in 1931. He served as the commander of the Yokosuka Naval District and the commander of the Second Fleet. In December 1931, he served as the Naval Minister of the Inukai cabinet. He resigned to take responsibility for the May 15th Incident last year.</p>

Since occupying our three northeastern provinces a few years ago, we have always exercised restraint in order to seek a public judgment from the League of Nations. They have been taking an inch and inching forward, pressing closer and closer. If we do not launch a large-scale punitive expedition, danger awaits us and justice cannot be established. Wanxin and others belong to the military and have a responsibility to resist foreign aggression. I should inspire the officers and soldiers to await orders to advance.

<h3>Refugees Escaping from Yuguan Reach 100,000</h3>
<p>=About 60,000 to 70,000 Refugees Gather in Qinhuangdao=</p>
<p>=Puppet State Sets Up County Government Maintenance Association in Yuguan=</p>
<p>=Enemy Troops Wait for Reinforcements on the East Bank of the Shi River=</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: After the fall of Linyu County, a large fire burned inside and outside the city for three days and three nights, and it did not go out until the afternoon of the fifth. The ruined walls and scorched earth are unbearable to witness. According to refugees who escaped to Tianjin, no less than 100,000 people escaped from Yuguan. There are still 60,000 to 70,000 people waiting for the train in Qinhuangdao. The Railway Bureau prepares a train once a day, which can only carry 10,000 people. The first to escape were the wealthy and well-off families. After the fall of Yuguan, the Japanese army, on the pretext of cleaning up the battlefield, searched house to house. Ronin and hooligans helped them abuse, as long as someone had a grudge against someone in the past. If an enemy secretly reported to the Japanese army that someone was a spy of the Chinese army, they would be immediately arrested and shot. Young students were especially hated by the Japanese army, and countless people died unjustly. Young women were all raped or gang-raped. Valuable objects and food in the family were all looted. Therefore, ordinary poor people who did not want to escape had no choice but to escape. However, when leaving the city, they had to pass through two Japanese army defense lines and undergo two searches. If anyone was carrying clothes, silver, or money, ronin would follow them and threaten them with guns or electric knives in the middle of the road and rob them of their belongings. Therefore, among the 60,000 to 70,000 people gathered in Qinhuangdao, there are probably 30,000 to 40,000 who have no clothes, no food, no home to return to, and no relatives to turn to. The Pingjin authorities did not dare to let this large number of refugees arrive to add to the local concerns because there was no money to provide relief. However, there are no fewer than 500 retired warlords and retired politicians in Pingjin who used to exploit the people and accumulate millions of assets. Now they are hiding their heads and tails, living their extravagant lives. They not only do not contribute a penny to the national crisis, but also remain indifferent to these tens of thousands of disaster victims. Is it not greatly sad?</p>
<p>The puppet state has sent personnel to Linyu County, united with local gentry bullies and ruffians, and organized a temporary county government maintenance association. Slogans welcoming the Japanese army and the puppet army were posted everywhere, and announcements were made ordering the people to hang Japanese flags and puppet flags, otherwise they would be executed for treason. They do not know that those who remain in Yuguan are all old, weak, and unable to produce, so how can they have spare money to buy flags? Even if they had money, the shops were either destroyed by fire or looted, and there was no place to buy an inch of cloth. Therefore, they had no choice but to be slaughtered by the enemy.</p>
<p>When the Japanese army provoked on New Year's Day, the commander of the Ninth Brigade, He Zhuguo, was ordered to return to defend, but there was an order not to resist. Therefore, He's speech in Qinhuangdao yesterday was extremely painful. Among them, there was a sentence that said, "Not fighting, not making peace, not defending, not leaving, the hard work will be known by later generations." After the loss of Yuguan, Pingjin was shaken. The situation had become difficult to resist. Therefore, troops were deployed and hastily arranged. In recent days, trains carrying soldiers have passed through Tianjin, and the morale is very high. Knowing that for a year, the whole country has been scolding those who do not resist, which has truly made the Northeast Army's soldiers feel wronged. Generals Sun Dianying, Pang Bingxun, and Shang Zhen also expressed their passionate sentiments. As for the Japanese side, it is heard that the commander of the Japanese army stationed in Tianjin, Nakamura Kotaro, has received a telegram from the Japanese Ministry of the Army to deal with the Yuguan incident properly and to not allow it to expand.</p>
<p>Since the fourth, the enemy troops have stopped on the east bank of the Shi River and have not actively advanced westward, appearing to be in a state of ceasefire. Considering the reasons, 1. They hope that our military authorities will unconditionally cede Yuguan. If this can be done, they will advance and attack Rehe. 2. Qinhuangdao has the Kailuan Mining Bureau, with many material constructions. Kailuan refused to allow the Marines to land. Warships cannot fire, and aircraft cannot drop bombs. Attacking with only short guns and rifles is more loss than gain. 3. The Liaoxi National Salvation Army Volunteers have not been wiped out. If they go deep without thinking, once the rear is cut off, the loss will be great. For these reasons, they have taken a moderate approach to deal with us, in order to delay time and wait for reinforcements to complete their concentration. If the international atmosphere is not very bad, they will take tough measures against us again.</p>
<p>As for this city, it is still peaceful, but people are frightened, and the market is depressed. After 10:00 PM every night, there is a scene of quiet roads and few people. The Japanese Concession has locked the iron gates at the intersections of Chinese and Japanese borders and added electric fences. The Japanese Consulate and the nearby Japanese barracks have all piled up sandbags and purchased a large number of hemp bags and barbed wire. More than a hundred white Russians in Tianjin have been bought by the enemy and ordered to command plainclothes teams to prepare for future sabotage. It is heard that Xiong Xiling and others have launched a Pingjin People's Self-Defense Association, uniting banks, chambers of commerce, silver trade unions, and other groups to form a sound and powerful organization. The purpose is to avoid the occurrence of war in Pingjin. Xiong arrived in Tianjin this afternoon to discuss with all walks of life. (January 6)</p>
<h3>Increasingly Tense Situation on the Rehe Border</h3>
<p>=Japanese Troops Withdrawing from Yu Back to Chaoyang=</p>
<p>=Villages in Kailu Burned by Japanese=</p>
<p>A dispatch from Beiping: Tang Yulin, Chairman of Rehe Province, reported via telephone yesterday (the 5th) that the Japanese 6th and 8th Divisions, which were deployed from the Rehe border to Shanhaiguan when the Yu Pass incident occurred, have been successively and completely withdrawing to the territory of Lingnan Chaoyang County since the 3rd. Although no major clashes have occurred in Chaoyang County recently, the Japanese troops are honing their weapons and vigorously building defense works overnight. Two Japanese aircraft flew to Chaoyang Lingyuan via Chengde to Kailu at 1:00 PM on the 5th for low-altitude reconnaissance, but did not take any other actions. Cui, the brigade commander of Kailu, telegraphed Tang Yulin on the 4th, reporting that a unit of the Volunteer Army led by Feng Zhanhai shot down a Japanese plane with anti-aircraft guns in Wangjia Youfang. The Japanese side became increasingly furious as a result. In addition to fierce battles with Feng's volunteer army, they also set fire to villages near Kailu with oil and firewood. Our military's Kailu front has not moved.</p>
<p>A person from Chaoyang Temple said that the Rehe Self-Defense Army led by Zhang Xiaoshan has withdrawn to the Yingzi area. Japanese troops have been bombarding Yingzi with heavy artillery for days, but the volunteer army is hiding in deep valleys, and the heavy artillery is of little effect. Villagers found heavy artillery shells weighing four catties and thirteen taels, which shows how fierce the artillery fire was.</p>
<p>A certain important person from the Rehe Provincial Government who came to Beiping yesterday morning stated that the main force of the Japanese army has only reached Chaoyang Temple. The rumor that the Japanese army has occupied Chaoyang originated from this statement. Upon investigation, Chaoyang Temple is more than 170 li away from Chaoyang, and there is still the important town of Beipiao in between. The defenses of our troops stationed in various places are extremely solid. The essential route to enter Rehe must pass through the Yebaishou area west of Chaoyang. This place is extremely dangerous, with a strategic pass where one person can hold off ten thousand. Even if the enemy comes in thousands, it would be difficult for them to survive if there were several machine guns. Moreover, in the Suidong area north of Kailu, hundreds of sand dunes form mountains, which are higher than Jingshan in Beiping and stretch to Heilongjiang. The sand is loose, and even a single person walking on it will have their feet sinking in, let alone an army. If the Japanese army rashly invades Rehe regardless, when they pass through this area, without our army attacking them, they will surely be wiped out in the sand. The enemy's powerful weapons such as tanks and heavy artillery will be even more useless.</p>
<p>A person from Rehe said that after Feng Zhanhai's 10,000-strong force arrived in Rehe from Jilin, they immediately engaged in replenishment. The commander of the troops left in Jilin, Zhang Chunxi, led his 10,000-strong force from Wuchang, Jilin, via the Sitao Road, to Xiawazi on the Rehe border on the 30th of last year. They are now stationed with Feng Zhanhai's troops in one place and are determined to fight the enemy as soon as the opportunity arrives. (6th)</p>
<h3>Han Fuqu Stopped from Going to Beiping</h3>
<p>Jiang Bocheng Still Going to Beiping for Instructions</p>
<p>A dispatch from Jinan: Han Fuqu, Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, originally planned to go to Beiping this afternoon (the 6th) with Jiang Bocheng, Gao Lingbai, Zhang Weicun, and others to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. However, considering the urgent external aggression and the importance of public security in North China, Han first telegraphed Chairman Chiang on the 5th to ask for instructions on whether to proceed. Last night (the 5th), he received Chiang's reply, stating that at this time of external aggression, local security is of great importance and that he should not go to Beiping. Jiang Bocheng, the Chief Advisor, could make the trip to Beiping instead. Therefore, Han canceled his trip south, while Jiang Bocheng and Gao Lingbai still departed from Jinan for Beiping at 10:00 AM this morning (the 6th). Before their departure, Han Fuqu, Li Shuchun, and others went to the station to see them off. According to Han's conversation with reporters, he originally planned to go to Beiping with Chief Advisor Jiang today, but he received a telegram from Chairman Chiang last night, ordering him not to go. Therefore, he canceled his trip south. There have been no major changes in the battle of Shanhaiguan. According to a telegram from Deputy Commander Zhang, our army is reinforcing the resistance, and morale is very high. Jiang Bocheng also told reporters that Chairman Han originally planned to go to Beiping with him to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, but he received a telegram from Chairman Chiang, stating that local security was important and ordering Chairman Han to stay in Jinan to maintain order, so he was going alone. He would not stay in Beiping for long and would return to Jinan in about three to five days. Gao Lingbai said that he was previously ordered to come to Shandong to monitor the transfer of Liu's troops, and now that the task was completed, he was returning to Beiping to report his mission.</p>
<p>The division and brigade commanders and militia commanders of the Third Route Army, who were previously summoned to Jinan by Han for training, have now completed their tasks. The division and brigade commanders are returning to their defense areas one after another. Zhan Shutang returned to Linyi at 9:30 AM today (the 6th). Cao Fulin and Zhao Mingyuan also returned to Zhoucun and Linqu at 12:15 PM at noon. The remaining division and brigade commanders and militia commanders will also return to their defense areas immediately. (6th)</p>

This cannot but arouse the deep attention of the League of Nations and all relevant countries. We should also state at this time that if the countries that share the same _ as the League of Nations can quickly take effective sanctions in accordance with the provisions of Article 16 of the Covenant, it may still be possible to curb the expansion of the current unfortunate incident.

Yesterday, they received a reply telegram stating that the funds had been received and that morale was high and the battle results were good. After news of the Battle of Yu Pass spread overseas, it was said to be comparable to the Shanghai Anti-Japanese War of the 19th Route Army. The Philippine Chinese Zhuxili Chamber of Commerce has specially remitted 1,200 yuan to be forwarded to the front line for consolation by the Northeast Refugee Relief Association. It is reported that it has been remitted yesterday.</p>
<h3>He Zhuguo Replies to Two Organizations with a Telegram</h3>
<p>Commander He Zhuguo replied to the telegram from the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce Local Association, saying: I have read your telegram and understand the situation clearly.

<h3>Battle Report Received in This Port</h3>
<p>A certain organization in this port received a telegram from Beiping yesterday, saying: Greetings to colleagues, I have read the telegram. 1. Yu Pass was captured after three advances and three retreats because the enemy used land, sea, and air forces to burn down the south gate. 2. The war was quiet today and yesterday. 3.

The railway between Jiang Yu Pass and Suizhong was destroyed in many sections, and the Japanese armored vehicles could no longer move. Our army in the Yu Pass area is planning a counterattack. In order to provide support, the Japanese army is attempting to land at Qinhuangdao. I hereby report first.</p>

<h3>Eyewitness Account from the Kailian Steamer Crew</h3>
<h3>Japanese Troops Bombing Yu Pass</h3>
<p>The Ship Will Sail to Qinhuangdao Tomorrow</p>
<p>The Zilin Newspaper reports that the Kailian steamer of the Kailian Company arrived in Shanghai yesterday (the 7th). According to reports, this is the first ship to sail south from Qinhuangdao since the resumption of enemy action in the north. The ship left Qinhuangdao on Wednesday, the day after the Battle of Yu Pass broke out. It witnessed the Japanese warships bombarding Yu Pass. However, it only carried three passengers to Shanghai. Yesterday, a reporter went to the Yangjiadu Wharf of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to meet with the crew. According to reports, at about 9:00 AM on Wednesday (the 2nd), the ship saw three Japanese destroyers bombarding Shanhaiguan City. The artillery fire was fierce and continued for two or three hours. The extent of the damage suffered by the city could not be estimated because Yu Pass is more than eight miles away from Qinhuangdao. The next morning, the British gunboat Foxglove arrived in Qinhuangdao, and later the British warship Wattle arrived. A larger Japanese warship also arrived that day, but it did not fire. Kailian set sail for Shanghai at 3:00 PM that afternoon. At that time, traffic between Qinhuangdao and Shanhaiguan was practically cut off because the Chinese army had destroyed the railway behind Qinhuangdao City to prevent the advance of enemy armored vehicles. When the ship was docked in Qinhuangdao, it heard that the Japanese army was concentrating north of Shanhaiguan. However, only a few troops were seen from the ship. At present, loading and unloading goods at Qinhuangdao has not been obstructed. The ship will still sail to Qinhuangdao on Tuesday. However, Kailian Company is now planning to have a ship stationed in Qinhuangdao at all times in case of emergency to carry overseas Chinese out of the country.</p>

<h3>Japanese Garrison Held a Military Parade This Morning</h3>
<p>This is an Annual Event in Their Country</p>
<p>Residents of the City Should Not Be Alarmed</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Japanese Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai, numbering approximately 2,500, was originally scheduled to hold a military parade at Hongkou Park on the morning of January 4. However, due to rain, it was rescheduled to 9:00 AM this morning at the same location. The municipal government of this city, deeply concerned that this may easily cause panic among citizens at this time of serious situation, specially ordered the five district police stations to post public notices to reassure the people in the areas of northern Shanghai yesterday, advising them not to be alarmed. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Police Station Notice</h3>
<p>The five district police stations posted a public notice yesterday morning, saying: For the purpose of issuing a notice, the Japanese Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai was originally scheduled to hold a military parade at the New Hongkou Park on January 4, which is an annual event in their country. This station had already issued a notice on the 3rd. Later, the Public Security Bureau issued a notice stating: For the purpose of issuing a notice, the Japanese Marine Corps was originally scheduled to hold a military parade on the 4th of this month. However, it was rescheduled due to heavy rain and will be held at the New Park on the morning of the 9th of this month. The Japanese Marine Corps holds a military parade after the New Year, which is a routine matter and has no other purpose. Therefore, we hereby reissue the notice to inform everyone not to be alarmed. This notice, Jin Gong, District Chief of the Fifth District.</p>
<h3>Tranquility in All Areas</h3>
<p>The Central News Agency reporter, in view of the fact that although the rumors in the city have subsided in recent days, there are still people who are overly sensitive and prone to speculation, hired a car to go to the areas of northern Shanghai and western Shanghai for on-site observation. First, from Fanwangdu to Toyota Yarn Factory on Zhongshan Road, then to Caojiadu and detoured to Zhabei, and then entered the areas of North Sichuan Road where the roads are built across the border. The city was as usual along the way, and pedestrians were bustling, with no sign of panic, which proves that the rumors in the city in the past few days were all speculation by well-meaning people and should not be believed. Then, the car arrived in the territory of a precinct in the Fifth District for observation. This district is where most of the Japanese reside, with more than 1,600 Japanese residents. The reporter visited Liang Fuchu, the head of the district, who said that the Japanese army has no conspiracy to invade Shanghai again. The rumors are not credible. He deeply believes that the January 28 Incident was partly caused by provocations by Japanese ruffians in Shanghai. After the incident, the Japanese Consulate General was deeply concerned that ruffians in Shanghai would cause trouble again, and successively transported the group of unemployed ruffians back to their country. Therefore, there are very few Japanese ruffians in Shanghai now, and they will no longer take provocative actions. Therefore, he firmly believes that no incident will occur in this city. According to Japanese sources, after the Japanese army finishes the military parade at Hongkou Park this morning, they plan to go to the Japanese cemetery at Bazibao Bridge to pay homage to the soldiers who died in the Shanghai War.</p>

<h3>Song Dynasty Hospital Director Self-Prepared Cessnas Plane</h3>
<h3>Crashed on the Banks of the Longhua River Yesterday</h3>
<h3>A Driving Beauty Couple, One Dead, One Injured</h3>
<p>Song Was Not Alarmed Before Entering Beijing When the Accident Occurred</p>
<p>Song Ziwen, the Acting Executive Yuan President, owned a Sikorsky airplane. Yesterday afternoon at 4:10 PM, while en route from Longhua to Hangzhou, piloted by an American pilot, the engine suddenly failed, and it crashed near the Longhua Riverbank. The Western pilot was seriously injured, and his wife, who was also on board, died from her injuries. The Sikorsky airplane was completely destroyed and beyond repair. A reporter from the New Life News Agency investigated and reported the details as follows:</p>
<p>〓Circumstances of the Accident〓 President Song's private Sikorsky airplane was being repaired at Longhua Airfield a few days ago. Yesterday at 4:15 PM, it was piloted by Mr. McDonald, an American instructor from the Hangzhou Aviation Military Academy, who planned to fly to Hangzhou. Mr. McDonald was accompanied by his wife. After taking off, when it was less than fifty feet above the Huangpu River in Longhua, the engine suddenly failed. As Mr. McDonald was attempting to descend, the wing tilted, causing the entire plane to overturn and crash on the Pudong riverbank near Longhua. Currently, half of the fuselage is submerged in the sand, and the other half is exposed in the water, completely destroyed. Mr. and Mrs. McDonald were seriously injured. 〓Rescue Efforts〓 After the accident, the China National Aviation Corporation immediately dispatched a seaplane to Pudong for rescue. At the same time, Mr. Pender of the company notified Hong En Hospital by telephone to send two ambulances, along with the company's workers, to provide assistance. At 4:45 PM, Mrs. McDonald was first transported by barge to the cement factory, transferred to an ambulance, and sent to Hong En Hospital on Great Western Road for emergency treatment. At around 5:00 PM, Mr. McDonald was also sent there.</p>
<p>〓Investigation of Injuries〓 Afterwards, according to an investigation by a reporter from the New Life News Agency, Mrs. McDonald had fractures in both legs and knee bones. The right side of her face and nose suffered severe trauma, with a two to three-foot-long puncture wound. She was unconscious after being pulled from the plane, barely breathing. She died at the hospital at 5:05 PM, before receiving treatment. Mr. McDonald only had a fracture in his right leg, but both upper limbs were severely injured, and his head was lacerated above the upper corner of his left eye. He was still conscious after being pulled from the plane, able to speak, and frequently cried out in pain. After being transported to the hospital, he was admitted to a third-floor ward for treatment. According to Dr. Bodet, his injuries were very serious, but his life was expected to be saved. Mr. McDonald is an American instructor at the Hangzhou China Aviation Military Academy, residing with his family at the Hangzhou Leng Hotel. His wife had come with him a few days ago, and they purchased flowers and other items yesterday to take back to Hangzhou, unfortunately meeting with disaster. 〓Total Destruction of the Aircraft〓 The Sikorsky airplane was an amphibious aircraft. After the crash, it overturned on the riverbank. Both engines were completely destroyed, and the left wing was also bent. It is said that the purchase price reached over 200,000 yuan, and it could accommodate over ten passengers. The China National Aviation Corporation plans to tow it back when the tide rises and has dispatched police to guard it.</p>
<p>〓Song Was Not Alarmed〓 Acting Executive Yuan President Song Ziwen, upon receiving a telegram from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the Military Affairs Commission, had earlier departed at 2:00 PM, accompanied by Secretary Huang Chundao, on another airplane to Beijing, thus avoiding alarm.</p>
<h3>Li Du and Ding Chao</h3>
<h3>Telegraph the Situation of Bitter Fighting</h3>
<p>The Enemy Attacks Modao Shi in Three Routes; Fierce Battles Last Two Days and Nights</p>
<p>Bamiantong Falls on the 2nd; Morale Remains High</p>
<p>Military Supplies Are Scarce and the Cold Is Severe; Awaiting Urgent Assistance to Fight</p>
<p>Generals Li Du and Ding Chao telegraphed Chiang and Zhang yesterday, reporting the situation of bitter fighting and requesting assistance. The original telegram reads: "To Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the Nanjing Military Affairs Commission, Minister He of the Ministry of Military Administration, Chief of Staff Zhu of the General Staff Headquarters, Director Zhang in Beiping, and the Military Committee Branch of the Political Affairs Commission: Recently, the Japanese army has launched a three-pronged attack, one from Zhuhe and Fangzheng, attempting to seize Boli; one from Hailin Station on the Middle East Railway, attacking Bamiantong; and one from Tielinghe, attacking Modao Shi. On the 30th day before the new year, our army's left wing, the Ying and Guo brigades, engaged the enemy at Modao Shi. The Japanese and puppet troops, numbering about 2,000, fought fiercely for two days and nights, capturing two mountain cannons and several machine guns, and killing over a hundred enemy soldiers. They destroyed the mountain caves along that route, cutting off the enemy's advance. However, due to the enemy flanking from both sides and surrounding our army, and the artillery fire being extremely fierce, and five airplanes bombing, our army ran out of ammunition. Military supplies have been scarce for years, and most of the uniforms are incomplete. In this severe cold, soldiers fight day and night, with most suffering from frostbite, making it impossible to hold on. The enemy crossed our left wing defenses on the 2nd of winter and passed through Xiachengzi. At the same time, Bamiantong has fallen, but morale remains high. Fresh troops are now being deployed in Lishu Town to defend firmly and resist the enemy. It is said that the enemy's move is a comprehensive plan to eliminate all anti-Japanese forces, in order to achieve its policy of aggression. Du and others vow to resist and preserve the national spirit of our Northeast. In addition to reporting any developments by telegram at any time, this is respectfully telegraphed. Signed, Li Du, Deputy Commander of the Jilin Border Defense Army stationed in Jilin, and Ding Chao, Chairman of the Jilin Provincial Government."</p>

<h3>Representatives of Overseas Chinese in Vietnam Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Will Proceed to Nanjing and Beiping for Negotiations</p>
<p>According to the China United Press in this city, since the outbreak of the national crisis, the spirit of overseas Chinese in Vietnam in running around to save the country has been consistent from beginning to end and has not been relaxed at all, such as the organization of the food reduction association and the establishment of the economic union. All the work is actively advancing. In addition to entrusting Mr. Bai Hongji of the Chia Hua Bank to reside in Shanghai to investigate the truth of all parties, recently the Overseas Chinese Business Economic Union, considering the urgency of the Yu Pass and the danger of North China, has specially dispatched Junlai to Shanghai to proceed to Nanjing and Beiping to discuss important matters. It is said that Mr. Zhang arrived in port yesterday. Mr. Huang Jianzhong, Mr. Jun Hongji, etc., had previously received a telegram from Vietnam informing them, so dozens of people welcomed them at the pier. After a brief rest at Mr. Weng's mansion at No. 33 Tiantang Street, Mr. Huang and Mr. Bai led them to observe the scars of war in various places, which they saw and returned home in tears, it is said.</p>
<h3>Siam Overseas Chinese National Salvation Association</h3>
<h3>Sends a Letter Requesting Assistance in Dealing with Traitorous Merchants</h3>
<p>According to the Yuan Wen News Agency, the Siam Overseas Chinese Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association sent a letter to the Shanghai Northeastern Volunteer Army Support Association, stating, "Since the September 18th Incident, our association has promoted the boycott of enemy goods, which has been unanimously supported throughout Siam. Unexpectedly, there are cold-blooded traitors, Chen Yueji, Tongshunchang, Zhang Bingchang, Huasheng, Minsheng, Huang Songji, Chen Shisheng, Wang Ruizhen, etc., who dare to covet petty profits, contact Japanese commercial firms, purchase large quantities of enemy goods, and dump them in Siam. This is the first time since the September 18th Incident that they have been transported, causing the overseas Chinese in Siam to follow suit. Recently, the shipment of Japanese goods to Siam has returned to normal. Upon investigation, the traitorous merchants are blinded by profit and disregard our association's repeated warnings. After deliberation at our association's standing committee meeting, it was decided to request local organizations in various provinces, cities, and counties to provide substantial assistance in investigating and punishing the Japanese-loving traitorous merchants in Siam, as well as all their affiliates in China and their relatives living in inland villages, in order to deter the traitorous merchants." The rest is omitted.</p>
<h3>Messengers of the Three Telegraph Offices Resume Work</h3>
<p>Direct Consultation Between Both Parties</p>
<p>Ten Workers Fired</p>
<p>Seventy-seven messengers from the Great Northern, Great Eastern, and Pacific Three Telegraph Offices,</p>
<p>Declared a strike on the 21st of last month due to the failure to meet nine demands. The Three Telegraph Offices immediately switched to using Western messengers for delivery and announced the dismissal of all striking workers. Although the city party department sent personnel to mediate, the company's attitude was firm, and there was no room for consultation. After Mr. Yuan Ludeng, a Chinese director, took on mediation, there were still no results. Subsequently, the bureau used Western children to deliver telegrams, and there were occasional errors, leading to blame from telegram recipients. At this point, the attitude changed slightly. The workers also expressed willingness to concede. They prepared a formal letter and appointed representatives to directly negotiate with General Manager Pengxun. As a result of the negotiations between the two parties, the company decided to dismiss seven workers from the Great Eastern, including Ye Tianzheng and Chen Zengshou, and seven from the Great Northern, including Shao Yanhe, and Chen Ziqing from Pacific. The rest were allowed to resume work. Because of the fear of livelihood and the fact that the strike had not been approved by the party and government, the workers believed that the procedures were also flawed, so they agreed and declared a resolution. All the workers resumed work at the bureau the day before yesterday (Saturday). All the Western children temporarily hired by the bureau have been withdrawn. As for the ten dismissed, including Ye Tianzheng, the bureau will issue December salaries and recall their uniforms, it is said.</p>

<h3>Yesterday, All Circles Mourned Chen Shenfu</h3>
<p>Distinguished Guests Initiate Fundraising to Purchase Fighter Planes</p>
<p>Designated "Chen Shenfu" to Forever Remember</p>
<p>Chen Shenfu, the eldest son of the martyr Chen Qimei, died in Hangzhou on September 9 of last year while piloting a training plane. Yesterday, all circles held a memorial service at Lake Society, deciding to launch a fundraising campaign to purchase a fighter plane, designated "Chen Shenfu", to commemorate him. The details are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Venue Arrangement</h3>
<p>A plain-colored archway was erected at the entrance of Lake Society, with the words "Memorial Service for Mr. Chen Shenfu" hung high. After entering, the couplets on both sides were eye-catching. On the stage of the auditorium, a portrait of Sun Yat-sen was hung high, with the party and national flags crossed. In the center was a portrait of martyr Chen Shenfu, with President Lin of the National Government's horizontal inscription "Cloud Qu Shayu" above it. Next to it was a eulogy couplet from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the Military Affairs Commission. The stage was filled with wreaths. The Lake Society memorial article was placed on the east side, and the Li Peien memorial article was placed on the west side.</p>

<h3>Meeting Proceedings</h3>
<p>At 2:00 PM, the memorial service began, presided over by Chui Qiatong as the master of ceremonies. First, the military band of the Public Security Bureau played music, and everyone stood in silence. Mayor Wu Tiecheng presided over the ceremony, and Ms. Chen Jingrong and Ms. Zou Yaxin offered flowers. Shen Tianxin, a representative of Lake Society, Yan Yanxuan, a representative of the Nanjing Lake Society Office, Li Peien, President of Zhijiang University, and others read memorial articles. The presiding officer delivered a eulogy. Zhang Zhenhua, a representative of Shanghai University, and Lu Gao Yi, a representative of Zhijiang Middle School, reported on the deeds of Martyr Chen Shenfu. Wu Jingheng, Pan Gongzhan, Wang Xiaolai, Li Guangyu, and others spoke successively. Chen Qinshi, a family representative, gave a thank-you speech. Finally, music was played, and the meeting adjourned at 4:30 PM.</p>
<h3>Memorial Article</h3>
<p>Memorial article for the Chen Shenfu Memorial Service, recorded as follows: "On the 8th day of January in the 22nd year of the Republic of China, Wu Tiecheng, the presiding officer, and all circles of friends, Lake Society members, and fellow villagers from Lake County, respectfully offer flowers to the spirit of Chen Jun Shenfu, Oh, Mr. Chen was born with extraordinary talents, and he harbored great ambitions from a young age. When he was only four years old, he suffered a family disaster. He harbored hatred for his enemies and vowed not to live under the same sky with them. He inherited the legacy of his father and followed his example. He was heroic and energetic, full of vigor. He studied at Zhijiang University, abandoned his pen to join the army, and flew to save the country, braving the wind and waves. His great ambitions were not fulfilled, and a star suddenly fell. He died for the country, so what regret is there? His righteousness is awe-inspiring, and his heroic spirit will last forever. Looking at his portrait, he is worthy of being from a general's family. The safety and security of the country depend on capable officials. Why did heaven not take pity and take away our talented young man? May your spirit be with us, and may you come and receive our offerings. Alas, farewell."</p>
<h3>Presiding Officer's Speech</h3>
<p>Wu Tiecheng said, "Today is the Shanghai All Circles Memorial Service for Martyr Chen Shenfu. China is currently facing a national crisis, and the country and nation are in danger. I hope that all ambitious young people in the country will rise up, use their knowledge and abilities, and, under the leadership of the government, save the country from its difficulties. Chen Shenfu was the eldest son of the martyr Chen Qimei, and he knew his responsibility to the country, 'knowing shame and wiping out shame'. When he was a young student, he prepared to continue his father's unfinished business. Unfortunately, he died prematurely. Now the Northeast incident is serious. I hope that all ambitious young people will rise up, continue the spirit of Martyr Chen Shenfu, obey the leadership of the party and government, and work together to overcome the national crisis. Then the future of the country may have hope of being saved."</p>
<h3>Speeches from All Walks of Life</h3>
<p>⑴ Wu Jingheng said, "Chen Shenfu's father, Mr. Qimei, sacrificed himself and China succeeded. Now Shenfu sacrifices himself, and aviation will succeed in the future. Shenfu and his father have the same spirit. Now he died for aviation, and although he died, he is still glorious. It can be said to be 'Mingzhe Baoshen'. Our country's resistance to Japan's aggression is just empty talk and preparation for resistance. After another twenty years, there is still no way. I hope that men and women, young and old, everyone will rise up to save the national crisis. In the past, a truce was won by a longer army than a shorter army. Today's longer army is airplanes. It is not difficult for China to purchase airplanes. For example, each airplane costs 200,000 yuan, so 10,000 airplanes cost 2,000,000,000 yuan. The loss of China's civil war is very large. What is 2,000,000,000 yuan? If 10,000,000 airplanes were built, then the January 28th Incident would never have allowed Japanese airplanes to run rampant like this. Now we should prepare money to purchase airplanes." ⑵ Wang Xiaolai said, "Mr. Shenfu is holding a memorial service today in the Chen Qimei Memorial Hall. I once paid my respects to Yue Fei's tomb in Hangzhou because Yue Fei was a hero and admired by people. Now Shenfu is the same as Yue Fei. Learning airplanes can be considered brave. At first, the physical examination was not suitable, but Shenfu was determined to learn. Like the 19th Route Army resisting the Japanese army, it was clear that the military equipment was not as good, but resistance was necessary. Since the September 18th and January 28th national crises, our country has lacked aviation too much. If we want to save the national crisis and seek national survival, we must: ⑴ save the country through aviation, ⑵ promote domestic goods, and ⑶ abolish civil war. Now Shenfu has sacrificed himself. I hope to set up a memorial to commemorate him permanently." The speeches of Pan Gongzhan and others are omitted.</p>
<h3>Purchase Aircraft for Commemoration</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu Tiecheng reported that Mr. Wu Jingheng, Wang Xiaolai, Pan Gongzhan, and other gentlemen proposed setting up a memorial. My opinion is that all the representatives attending the meeting should be the initiators and raise funds to purchase a fighter plane, named "Chen Shenfu", to commemorate him. Everyone unanimously agreed.</p>
<h3>Family Thanks</h3>
<p>Chen Qinshi, a family representative, thanked, "Today, I am very unworthy of the warm mourning of my nephew Chen Shenfu by all circles. Now that Shenfu is dead, I hope that all the young patriots in the country will rise up, practice aviation, and complete Shenfu's unfinished business."</p>
<h3>Yu Rizhang Telegraphed Thanks for Condolences from All Circles</h3>
<p>When Mr. Yu Rizhang met with Mr. Stimson at the White House in Washington on the 4th, he suddenly felt unwell. After a medical examination, he was transferred to the hospital for treatment. When the news was received, all parties were deeply concerned, and letters and telegrams of condolence poured in like snowflakes. Recently, a telegram was received from Mr. Yu's secretary, stating that Mr. Yu expressed his sincere thanks for the condolences from all parties, and that his condition is gradually improving. According to the doctor, after a brief rest, he will be discharged from the hospital soon.</p>
<h3>Stripping Yves of His Medals</h3>
<p>Those Who Befriend the Enemy Should Be Punished</p>
<p>Recover His Pension</p>
<p>Regarding the pro-Japanese behavior of the former Acting Inspector General of Customs, Yves, and the favors he received from China during his time in China, after our country's representative made a declaration in Geneva, the European side has a considerable understanding of Yves's character. It is now learned that the current government has formally ordered the stripping of all of Yves's medals at the request of a certain Westerner in the customs, and the authorities also intend to recover his pension of 9,000 pounds. However, it is not yet known what method will be used in the future.</p>
<h3>Charity Lottery Tickets Sold by This Museum</h3>
<h3>Are Also About to Be Sold Out</h3>
<p>The charity horse racing lottery tickets this time are very popular, and all sales outlets are overwhelmed. It is said that most of the sales outlets have been sold out, but this museum still has some left, but the number is small. The Finance Bureau has now set a deadline for tomorrow (the 10th). Those who want to buy them must hurry.</p>
<h3>Japanese Residents in Shanghai</h3>
<h3>Raise the So-Called National Defense Donation</h3>
<p>Profits from Dumping Sales in Shanghai</p>
<p>All Remitted to the Military for Military Supplies</p>
<p>Shishi Telegraph Agency, 8th, this city news: The highest Japanese military authorities have resolved to actively prepare for war with a military expenditure budget of 220 million yen, and have ordered people across the country to actively donate. Japanese businessmen residing in this city have specially organized leagues of Japanese businessmen from various routes to raise national defense donations. They have remitted the total amount of 60,000 yuan, the profit from the dumping sales of Japanese businessmen's alliances in the Wusong Road area in December of last year, to the military. Other organizations, such as Japanese people in Shanghai and veterans' associations, have also initiated fundraising to purchase military equipment and plan to hold a meeting in the near future to discuss large-scale fundraising, it is said.</p>
<h3>Winter Disaster Relief Notes in Beiping</h3>
<p>Report by the Chinese Relief Association</p>
<p>The Chinese Relief Association has been running soup kitchens in Beiping in recent years, such as Baiyi Nunnery outside Chaoyangmen, Landian Factory, Shucun, etc., or four or five factories. The annual cost is not small. This year, the disaster situation in Beiping is very serious, and there are many refugees fleeing from the Northeast, endlessly. It is now the severe winter, with no clothes or food. They are not even able to die, and there is no way to survive. The head of the relief office stationed in Beiping, Mr. Zhou Jingfu, and the head of the relief office stationed in Tianjin, Mr. Yu Guisheng, have repeatedly sent letters requesting the establishment of soup kitchens to relieve the disaster. Because the association is currently in severe financial straits and has exhausted all means, it is powerless to help but cannot bear not to help. It has reluctantly set up a soup kitchen outside Chaoyangmen, providing grain once every seven days, and prepared a thousand sets of cotton clothes for distribution to those in need. Disaster victims have gathered four to five thousand people, and the number of arrivals is increasing. There is not enough porridge for everyone, so what help can be provided? Adding factories is limited by funds, and one factory is difficult to maintain. It is hoped that compassionate comrades will form good relationships and save more of the Northeast's troubled people and Beiping's hungry and cold compatriots. Saving people is saving the country, and the merit is inconceivable. The blessings are immeasurable, it is said.</p>
<h3>Request to Exempt Additional Canal Grain Tax Denied</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Public Fund and Public Property Management Office recently submitted a request to the Jiangsu Finance Department, requesting that the additional two yuan per stone of the second term land price tax (winter canal grain) for this year be exempted from collection, citing the suffering of the people of Jiangsu. Yesterday, the office received an official letter from the county government, stating that it had received an order from the Finance Department, stating that the additional two yuan per stone of winter canal grain tax in this province was originally intended to address the fact that the provincial treasury was exhausted and the income did not meet the expenditures after last year's flood. The request for exemption from collection concerns a general case for the entire province and cannot be approved, it is said.</p>
<h3>Stamp Duty Added to Steamer Tickets</h3>
<p>Tax Bureau Agrees to Industry Recognition and Package</p>
<p>The Shanghai Steamer Ticket Industry Association previously repeatedly petitioned against the Shangbao Stamp Duty Bureau's notification of the addition of stamp duty to steamer tickets and requested exemption from the Ministry of Finance. Now that the Ministry of Finance has replied that it is not approved, the association plans to proceed with the recognition and package procedures to avoid the trouble of stamping each ticket individually. Representatives were sent to negotiate with the tax bureau the other day, and the bureau has expressed its approval and set the package fee at 100 yuan per month, to be paid by the industry association on the 15th of each month. If there are any violators in the industry who do not affix stamps, the tax bureau will be notified immediately to impose a fine, which will be collected and stored by the association. It is said that both parties have now agreed, and a formal agreement will be signed after further negotiations.</p>
<h3>Songhu Road</h3>
<h3>Increasing Evening Bus Service</h3>
<p>Scheduled to Begin Tomorrow</p>
<p>Since the resumption of traffic on the Songhu Road, due to the post-war commercial decline, there are fewer travelers at night. Therefore, the Songhu buses only ran until 6 or 7 pm. Recently, due to the year-end accounting being imminent, the number of businesses traveling to and from Songhu has gradually increased. It is very inconvenient that there are no buses after 7 pm. Therefore, a request has been made to the bureau to increase the number of buses. After considering the situation, the bureau has ordered the transportation department to increase the number of passenger buses to and from Songhu at night. At the same time, the bus schedule has also been slightly changed. The departure times from Paotaiwan are 6:55 AM, 7:40 AM, 8:55 AM, 10:10 AM, 11:00 AM, 1:00 PM, 2:45 PM, 3:30 PM, 4:30 PM, 6:35 PM, 8:15 PM, and 9:55 PM daily.

This newly revised schedule is scheduled to take effect tomorrow.</p>

<h3>Forensic Medical Research Institute</h3>
<h3>Examination and Identification of Paternity Cases</h3>
<p>Unprecedented in Our Country</p>
<p>According to Huadong News Agency, the Forensic Medical Research Institute of the Ministry of Justice in Zhenru previously received a letter from the Baoshan County Government stating that it had accepted the case of Wang Zhenju and Wang Jiangshi suing Zhang Zuofu and others for abducting a young girl. After several court hearings, Wang Zhenju and others stated that the girl, named Xiaojuan, disappeared on the 18th day of the third lunar month of the 15th year of the old calendar and was sold to Qian A’jin as a child bride. This girl is indeed our biological daughter, and the defendants’ abduction and sale behavior constitutes a criminal offense and should be investigated. According to Qian A’jin, the girl was bought from Qin Zhangshi. According to Qin Zhangshi, she was bought from Pan A’tao. According to Pan A’tao Hong, she was given to me by Xu Qingtang. According to Xu Qingtang, the girl was actually born to his deceased concubine. The Baoshan County Government stated that since both parties’ statements were contradictory, it was impossible to determine whether the girl was the biological daughter of Xu Qingtang et al. or Wang Zhenju et al. It was proposed to request the Forensic Medical Research Institute to conduct a paternity test. Now that the institute uses four types of human blood serum for paternity testing, and there are such cases, the serum should be collected and prepared in advance. A letter was sent requesting that the girl Wang Xiaojuan and the original defendants’ case files be sent to the institute yesterday for legal examination. The results will be used to compile an identification report for adjudication. It is said that this kind of examination and identification is unprecedented in our country.</p>

<h3>Connecting Copper Wires to Electric Meters</h3>
<h3>Punishment for a Hosiery Factory Stealing Electricity</h3>
<p>Zhang Yueying, a Ningbo woman who resided at No. 22, Shoufu Lane, Caishi Road, in the French Concession, operated a hosiery factory. Recently, she secretly drilled a small hole in the electric meter installed by the French Electric Light Company, inserting a copper wire to prevent the meter from moving in order to save electricity. This was discovered by a Westerner from the Electric Light Company, who reported it to the French police. Zhang Yueying was arrested and taken to the Second Special Court the day before yesterday. According to the police lawyer, the police were prosecuting her for theft under Article 337 of the Criminal Code. Subsequently, the plaintiff's lawyer, Bahu Chen, explained the case and stated that the company had suffered a total loss of 145 taels and requested incidental civil proceedings. The defendant, Zhang Pengying, stated that it was actually done by two people from the plaintiff's company, a person named Xiao Suzhou. The woman, Yueying, paid Xiao Suzhou expenses, knowing it was inappropriate. Now, the woman is willing to compensate the plaintiff for a loss of 100 taels. The plaintiff's lawyer also stated that since the defendant was willing to pay 100 taels, the plaintiff was willing to withdraw the civil suit. The judge ordered that since the private suit had been settled, the defendant should be fined 30 yuan for the public suit.</p>

<p>The Case of Japanese Ronin Stealing Wood Resolved</p>
<h3>Japanese Consulate Ordered to Compensate 700 Yuan for the Price of Wood</h3>
<p>Chen Yueting, a local resident of Ji Ruili, Xijiaxing Road, Hongkou, is 66 years old and works as a foreman. He has been diligent and thrifty for decades, so he has some savings. Before the January 28th Songhu War, Chen purchased a large batch of wooden boards, totaling more than 1,000 pieces. When the war broke out, the Xijiaxing Road area was first occupied by the Japanese army, and Chen abandoned his home to escape. After the war subsided, Chen moved back to reorganize his home, but the more than 1,000 wooden boards had disappeared. After repeated investigations, he learned that they had been stolen by a Japanese Ronin named Ban Shang Weicilang to make coffins and sell them to the army. Chen immediately appealed to the First Precinct of the Fifth District for negotiation. More than a month has passed. According to Liang Fuchu, the director of the precinct, the Japanese Consulate authorities expressed their hatred for the Japanese Ronin's theft of wooden boards and ordered the Ronin to compensate 700 yuan for the price of the wood. It is also learned that Wen Hongen, the director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, has commended Director Liang for his meritorious handling of this case, awarding him a commendation as an encouragement.</p>
<p>Red Candles Painted Black</p>
<h3>Hidden in Sleeves as Pistols</h3>
<p>Victims Were Frightened and Could Not Distinguish Truth from Falsehood</p>
<p>Multiple Cases of Theft by Tongzhou Bandits</p>
<p>Wang Jinsheng and Shan Zhaoxian, detectives of the Yangshupu Police Department, arrested thirteen bandits, including Tongzhou natives Wang Chunlin, Zhang Jingen, Zhu Xiaomao, Lu Lianqing, Shi Mincai, Qu Zhu, Xu Agen, Li Xiatang, Liu Youcai, Tang Zhuo, Zhu Silin, Jiang Yugao, and Wu Genqiang, in a bungalow without a number on Zhou Tangbang, Huade Road. Two pistols, nine bullets, and two fake pistols were seized and sent to the First Special District Court for investigation. During the changed date, it was learned that between May and December of last year, these people successively robbed Zhao Haixin at No. 150 Linqing Road, Xue Changhui at No. 1769 Pingliang Road, and Zhang Songshan at No. 498 Xiaoshadu Road, stealing clothes, ornaments, and silver worth more than 500 yuan, and committed an attempted robbery at Wang Liangfu's house at a certain number on Huade Road. Yesterday, Judge Zhao Linyu presided over the interrogation in the Third Criminal Court, and police lawyer Zhang Tianyin recounted the previous situation, stating that all the victims had arrived in court to testify today. The two seized fake pistols were made of red candles and painted with black paint. During the robbery, they were hidden in the sleeves, slightly revealing the muzzle, and used to intimidate the victims, who could not distinguish truth from falsehood. It was truly peculiar. He would present a report. Subsequently, the victims testified about the circumstances of being robbed, but only identified the defendant Liu Youcai as being present at the scene of the robbery, and it was difficult to identify the others. Under the judge Zhao's questioning, the defendants' answers were evasive. He ordered them to be remanded in custody for further verification on a later date.</p>

<h3>The Lawsuit Involving Jiu Yi Real Estate Company and Xi Ehan's Land Purchase</h3>
<p>The Court Orders a Scheduled Pronouncement</p>
<p>In May of the year before last, Jiu Yi Real Estate Company purchased over twenty mu of land from Xi Ehan for a price of 1,684,540 taels of silver. One-tenth of the amount was paid upfront, and the remaining balance was to be settled within one year. However, after the January 28th Incident last year, Jiu Yi claimed that its finances had been affected by the war and that it was unable to raise the large sum as scheduled. It then negotiated with Xi Ehan to extend the settlement period. Xi was unwilling to compromise and published a notice in the newspaper, canceling the contract with Jiu Yi and confiscating the one-tenth down payment. Jiu Yi was unwilling to lose 168,454 taels of silver for no reason and hired lawyer Chen Tingrui to file a lawsuit against Xi Ehan, requesting a judgment ordering the return of the money and statutory interest. Xi also hired lawyer Tai Liankui, arguing that the money received was only 163,020 taels and was not part of the land price, but rather a deposit. Since Jiu Yi failed to settle the payment as scheduled, it was a breach of contract, and the deposit should be confiscated. Moreover, due to Jiu Yi's failure to fulfill the contract, the value of the land has decreased, resulting in a loss of 480,000 taels of silver. Therefore, Xi filed a counterclaim against Jiu Yi, demanding compensation for the losses incurred. The case was sent to the First Special District District Court, where Judge Shen Hong opened the trial. After repeated hearings, as reported in this newspaper, the continuation hearing was held the other day. Both parties and their lawyers were present in court. However, Judge Shen, who was hearing the case, had been transferred, and the case was taken over by the newly appointed Judge Ding, who needed to re-examine the case for clarity. Judge Ding questioned Zeng Ziying, the manager of the plaintiff Jiu Yi, and the defendant repeatedly. Then, he ordered the start of the debate. Lawyer Chen Tingrui, representing the plaintiff, stated that the facts of the case were clear to the court. The plaintiff paid part of the land price, but has not received any land. Therefore, the defendant should be required to return it. There is no evidence that the money was a deposit. Even the unilateral Chinese contract submitted by the defendant cannot prove that it was indeed a deposit. The delay in settlement was due to the impact of the war, and the cancellation of the contract was initiated by the defendant and should not be a basis to claim losses from the plaintiff. Subsequently, the defendant's lawyer replied layer by layer. The court adjourned and scheduled a future date for the pronouncement.</p>
<h3>Li Hongzhang's Concubine's Inheritance Lawsuit Is Suspended</h3>
<p>Li Hongfu, the owner of Shuang Hongtai Funeral Shop, had a late elder brother named Hongzhang. During his lifetime, Hongzhang was estranged from his concubine, Hua Ayin, and sued in court, requesting the termination of their relationship as husband and concubine. The case had been adjudicated in two trials and finalized. However, after Hongzhang's death several years ago, Hua Ayin suddenly hired a lawyer to file a criminal self-accusation with the First Special District District Court against Li Hongfu, accusing him of misappropriating property. The court had held several hearings. Because the plaintiff insisted that she was Hongzhang's wife and that the previous lawsuit was decided in her absence, she was unaware of it. The court then ordered the case files to be retrieved and verified. The other day, Judge Zhang held another trial. The plaintiff and defendant were both present with their lawyers. Judge Zhang began by declaring that the case files from the previous appeals court showed that the judgment granting the termination of the relationship between husband and concubine was made in the 17th year of the Republic. Upon hearing this, the plaintiff's lawyer immediately requested that the case be suspended so that the plaintiff could seek redress from the civil court. However, the defendant's lawyers, Yan Luqing and others, strongly objected, stating that the plaintiff's claim to the right to divide the property had been disproven, so the case should be dismissed without further delay. In the end, Judge Zhang suspended the case.</p>
<h3>Robbery with Stabbing of the Victim</h3>
<p>Yesterday at around 4:00 PM, three robbers, two men and one woman, suddenly came to the residence of the Cha family at 7 Sanxing Lane, Jiandao Bridge, in the second district of Nanshi. They entered the inner room under the pretext of renting a house. The Cha family shouted for help. Tao, Cha's brother-in-law, happened to be at the Cha residence at the time. Knowing that he had encountered robbers, he noticed that neither of the two male robbers had a gun. He attempted to resist. Unexpectedly, one of the robbers pulled out a sharp blade and stabbed Tao. Tao released his grip in pain. The three robbers took the opportunity to escape without any loss. The victim immediately reported the incident to the second district. Chief Jin immediately dispatched police to investigate the situation in detail. Tao was rushed to Shanghai Hospital for treatment. It is reported that his injuries are severe and his life is still uncertain.</p>
<h3>Rent Collector Assaults Tenant</h3>
<p>Sanxin Lane on North Sichuan Road was originally managed by lawyer Dibeike. The contract expired at the end of December last year, and lawyer Chen took over management. Since the Shanghai Incident, the rent reduction has not been resolved. The landlord sued the tenant, Dr. Jiao Fuyin, a doctor residing in the lane, a few months ago. The case is awaiting court judgment. The other day at noon, the manager suddenly went to the doctor's residence to collect rent. Jiao told the rent collector that since the landlord had sued in court, he should pay according to the court's decision. At that time, the manager gathered over ten people and severely beat the doctor and his wife, destroying furniture and robbing them of clothing, etc. The servant of the house reported the incident to the police of the first sub-station of the fifth district. The police arrested five people who beat Dr. Jiao and the rent collector and took them to the station for interrogation, along with the injured. Later, because Dr. Jiao's injuries were too severe, the police of the first sub-station of the fifth district sent him to Fumin Hospital for treatment. It is reported that the tenants in the lane plan to sue the rent collector for illegal assault.</p>

<h3>Six Days of Investigating the River Embankment</h3>
<p>— Xu Shiying</p>
<p>From Nanjing to Hankou</p>
<p>For years, I have been rushing about with accounting matters, neglecting my filial duties for a long time. In October, I encountered the passing of my late father. Since I returned [home], I haven't been able to do my best to serve him in any small way. Unexpectedly, before the memorial service for my late father had even reached the one-month mark, various circles in Shanghai, concerned about disaster relief in the Northeast, Henan, Anhui, and Hubei provinces, urgently telegraphed me to return. Without time to consider my unworthiness, I, who had barely passed the 35-day mourning period, hastily set out eastward. I arrived back in Shanghai on November 25th. Before I could express my gratitude, numerous affairs converged. Mr. Li Zushen came to visit and discuss, and he entrusted me to participate in the National Government's Disaster Relief Committee's embankment inspection. I have been an official for years and have always felt ashamed for not making contributions; now that the long embankments have been built through the guidance of Committee Member Song Gong and the efforts of dedicated individuals, I am happy to take the opportunity to see the results. Furthermore, Mr. [name] has urged me to set out immediately, and with Lan Lao being older and more experienced than me, how could I dare to worry about the hardship? At the same time, various circles in Shanghai had also organized a disaster area inspection team for Henan, Anhui, and Hubei. They also tasked me with planning the division of groups for departure after arriving in Hankou. Therefore, this trip also carries a significant mission. Thus, I accepted Mr. Zushen's invitation to join the inspection, taking the night train on the 27th and transferring to a steamer westward. From November 28th to December 3rd, I recorded my observations along the way in a diary. Now, I have slightly reorganized them for publication in newspapers. Although my writing may lack elegance, it is a factual record.</p>
<p>November 28th: Arrived in Nanjing at 8:00 AM. After entering the city, I went to the Relief Committee to review documents, then went to the Lixing Society for lunch with Acting President Song. At 3:00 PM, I went to the pier below [location] to board a China Merchants Steam Navigation Company ship and participate in the embankment completion ceremony. After the ceremony, Acting President Song and people from various circles who came to see us off boarded the ship for tea and conversation. At 7:00 PM, the ship set sail, arriving in Wuhu at 11:00 PM. County Magistrate Gao Shouheng and representatives from various circles boarded the ship for a chat. Mr. Li Zushen, Xi Mingjiu, and others decided on the embankment inspection schedule for the next day.</p>
<p>November 29th: At 8:30 AM, took the Liliu small steamer to inspect the first section of the second district of the river embankment. This section is 4.69 kilometers long. Due to time constraints, we could not inspect the entire embankment. Instead, we first inspected the Xijiang Embankment from Sihe Mountain to Yijishan. The embankment is on the south bank of the Yangtze River, about nine kilometers long. According to the National Government's Disaster Relief Committee's specifications, the Yangtze River embankment surface should be four meters wide, with an inner slope of 1:2 to 1:5 and an outer slope of 1:3. The embankment was built according to these specifications. The associated benefited farmland is about 30,000 mu. The soil quality is good, and the construction is quite solid. This year, the highest water level was two meters below the embankment surface, sufficient to prevent floods and benefit agriculture. After completing the inspection of this embankment, we took the Liliu steamer upstream to about one kilometer west of Wuhu city, disembarked, and inspected the Puchu Embankment. This embankment extends about 12 kilometers to Hong Kong, all newly built this year. The old embankment at this location had collapsed too severely to be repaired, and to avoid erosion from the river tides, a new embankment was built eighty meters behind the old one. The construction and soil quality are similar to the Xijiang Embankment, belonging to the first section of the second district. Also, the Huangsi Embankment in the [same] district, about 50-60 meters long, is the largest embankment in the Jiangbei region. The farmland in Hefei, [Jiang], [Wei], [Chaoxian], [Hanshan] and seven [counties] are all protected by it. After lunch, we inspected the most dangerous part of the embankment. According to Wuhu County Magistrate Gao, in recent years, this section of the river embankment has been breached every few years due to changes in the river channel and the impact of the raging tides. After each breach, it is extremely difficult to recover, and the eroded riverbank becomes filled with silt, requiring the new embankment to be built several meters further back. In this cycle of [damage], the embankment repaired this year is already the fourth [iteration]. From the light tower [location] to [another location], about three kilometers, the embankment is about six meters wide and the slope is similar to other embankments. The construction is quite solid. The old embankment in this section has a wide surface with numerous tree stumps. The trunks and lower ends are mostly covered with grass roots, about ten feet high. Local residents say that these were left by the great flood last year, illustrating the severity of the flooding at that time. In the evening, Dr. Bai Shuren gave a lecture on China's economic problems.</p>
<p>November 30th: At 8:30 AM, took the Anping small steamer from Datong to inspect the six-hundred-zhang section of the second district. This section is twenty-five kilometers long, from [location] to Zhangjiaba. This section had not been repaired since the great flood of the twenty-ninth year of the Daoguang reign of the Qing Dynasty caused the embankment to breach. The Disaster Relief Committee planned to repair all the river embankments based on the original embankment works, but this section was not included in the survey. Later, at the request of local gentry, it was decided to repair it because the old embankment, although now collapsed, had historical records in the county gazette, and the uncultivated farmland in the area, about two to three hundred thousand mu, with the cultivated area being even larger, was important to Guichi, Tongcheng, [Jiangning], and Wuwei counties. The benefits were great. Mr. Zhu Ziqiao approved the construction, but a sluice gate should be built at the Tuchiao location for drainage to prevent flooding. The cost of this construction should be borne by the local area, while the Disaster Relief Committee allocated 1,000 tons of American flour for the embankment work, which began in July of this year. According to the Disaster Relief Committee's engineering report, as of September 30th, 229,447 cubic meters of earthwork had been completed in this section. During the inspection, workers were rushing to build, and the sounds of tools were constant. However, local people did not seem to have reached an agreement on the construction of the gate, and it was difficult to predict when construction could begin. In the afternoon, we arrived at Majiawo in Guangji Embankment and took a small boat to the Baocitang pier. This embankment, from Zongyang to Anqing, is 42.5 kilometers long and serves as a barrier for Huaining and Tongcheng. Once it collapses, not only will the farmland of the two counties be submerged, but the residents of the cities and villages will also be flooded. Its importance is paramount in Anhui Province. The embankment surface is four to six meters wide. What was inspected today was the most dangerous part of the embankment. The old embankment was severely damaged by the flood last year, and the silt deposits reached several feet. Now, the Disaster Relief Committee is building a new embankment 200 meters behind the old one, 42.5 kilometers long. The construction is extremely solid. However, the river tide is turbulent and comes with great force. If only the embankment itself is made solid without other flood control measures, then it will inevitably breach again in a few years. During the flood of 1922, I was in charge of Anhui's administration and relief efforts. Due to the importance of this embankment, I personally supervised the employees day and night to prevent danger, and fortunately, it was safe. However, this is not a fundamental solution. According to engineers, for the long-term safety of this dangerous section, multiple water diversion structures should be built outside the embankment to divert the water. [We must] urge them to make it happen. [This] is what [we must] pay attention to. That evening, at 7:30 PM, [we] arrived at Anqing. Chairman of the Provincial Government, and [other officials] and representatives from various circles were waiting on the riverbank. After the ship berthed, [we] returned to the reception center by the river for a welcoming meeting. Chairman Wu gave a welcoming speech, [another official] discussed the current state of construction in Anhui Province, and Dr. Bai gave a thank-you speech on behalf of the Westerners. Then, Mr. Li Zushen gave a thank-you speech on behalf of [someone]. As a native of Anhui, and having participated in the inspection again, I took the initiative to represent the people of Anhui and express my gratitude to Chairman Song of the National Government's Disaster Relief Committee, Sir Simpson, Director of the Disaster Area Work Group Zhu Ziqiao, Deputy Director Li Zushen, Director of the Labor Relief Office [name], and other staff. Also, Dr. Bai had provided spiritual and material assistance to our country during last year's flood, so I also thanked him. The Chinese and foreign officials participating in the inspection traveled through Anhui and inspected everything carefully. Their enthusiasm was very touching. The highly respected [official] and Secretary-General Chu of the Executive Yuan also accompanied the inspection. His spirit and perseverance were especially admirable. After the welcome meeting, [we] took a commemorative photo and returned to the ship, anchoring at Huayang. In the evening, Dr. Wu [name] gave a lecture on the topic of epidemic prevention during famine.</p>
<p>Today, a telegram was sent to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, reporting that the river embankment inspection went smoothly, the residents were safe, and the fields were [untouched]. Also, many members of the team wanted to personally inspect the recovered disaster areas of Henan, Anhui, and Hubei. Another telegram was sent to Wang Yilao, Wang [name], Huang [name], Bo Du and all the standing committee members in Shanghai, informing them that many members of the embankment inspection team wanted to join in and inspect the disaster situation in the two provinces. However, due to the roundabout route in Anhui Province, there were not enough team members to allocate. [We] invited Zhang Zepu and Hong San to take on the task, hoping they would pass the message to Hankou, etc.</p>
<p>December 1st: At 8:15 AM, took the Anjie small steamer to Huayang Town. Across the river is Xiangkou, 45 li from my home. Every time I return home, I must pass through this place. Looking at my hometown from afar, I was filled with emotion. After landing at Huayang Town, I inspected the Mahua Embankment. This embankment connects to the end of the Jingjiang Embankment at Majiagang and extends to Huayang Town, about 3,000 kilometers long, protecting the Yangtze River from the outside and Tanghu Lake from the inside. Together with the Peng Hua Embankment in Hubei Province, it forms a whole. The farmland of Susong, Taihu, Wangjiang in Anhui, Jiujiang, Pengze in Jiangxi, and Huangmei, Guangji in Hubei all benefit from this embankment. The repair last year was quite solid. The embankment surface is nine meters wide, the inner slope is 1:2, and the outer slope is 1:3. In total, the completed earthwork is about 1.5 to 1.6 million cubic meters. However, the Huayangkou at the end of the embankment, which was originally used to discharge inland water, often brings in river tides, causing reverse flow. Since the closure of the mouth in 1924, it has breached again the following year. Designers in recent years have proposed to close it again, but at least two more sluice gates should be added to allow the inland water to still drain, otherwise, the huge amount of money spent may lead to a repeat of the closure failure in 1924. Around 3:00 PM, [we] arrived at Huikou, opposite the Zhangjia Island and Hukou on the south bank. [We] changed to the Liliu small steamer and docked to inspect the river embankment repaired by the Huayang Yizhen Association on behalf of the fourth and fifth district labor relief bureaus. The entire section on the north bank, from Laozhoutou to Wuxue, is 100 kilometers long. The construction retreated about one li from the riverbank, with a uniform top width of four meters and inner and outer slopes constructed according to the specified standards. The project is extremely solid. Around 5:00 PM, [we] continued to inspect at Duanyao. It is part of the same embankment as the above-mentioned Huikou, and the situation is roughly the same. Furthermore, [we] met with the [name] personnel. [We] discussed the old embankment, which had collapsed several days ago. [We] can see the merit of the current repairs. Around 8:00 PM, the [official] from the Jiujiang section and representatives of various [organizations] came aboard. [We] disembarked to attend the welcome meeting at the [local government] office. [Official] gave a speech on [topic]. [We] returned to the [ship] at 10:00 PM. Today, [we] sent a telegram to Acting President Song, reporting the completion of the river embankment inspection, the solidity of the earthwork, the autumn harvest, and other circumstances. Another telegram was sent to Chairman Xiong of Jiangxi Province, saying that the river embankments in the province had also been inspected in many places, but that due to the roundabout route, the [name] embankment might be delayed. [We] will inspect it another day. Another telegram was sent to Chairman Wu of Anhui Province, who is also the chairman of the Anhui Disaster Relief Fundraising Committee, stating that the disaster situation in the province is serious and that [we] will do our best to work together to save the situation.</p>
<p>December 2nd: The ship set sail at 9:00 AM. At 2:00 PM, [we] arrived at Qichun. [We] took a small boat to the Yongquan Embankment, about three kilometers upstream from Tianjia Town. This embankment is a section of the Qichun-Wuxue River Embankment, connecting to the Yongcheng Embankment in the upper reaches and the Wuxue River Embankment in the lower reaches. The width of the embankment top varies from 2.5 meters at the narrowest to 10 meters at the widest. The inner and outer slopes vary from 1:2.5 to 1:3. The construction of this process is quite solid. [We] returned to the boat after inspection; it was already dusk. In the evening, [we] listened to Dr. [Name] give a lecture on Tai Chi. This was a talk based on the doctor's many years of experience, enhanced by film, which made it even more vivid. Today, the boat owner, Mr. Xu Shaoli, [offered] for the team members to write their names as a souvenir. Therefore, after writing my name, I wrote a poem: After the long embankment of thousands of miles is built, one can see clearly while traveling slowly along the river. The boat owner asks for a [poem]. One day, [we will] meet again [and] know each other's names.</p>
<p>December 3rd: As the morning light dawned, [we] arrived at Hankou. Just after breakfast, Chairman Xia [Bing] and representatives from various circles had already boarded the ship to greet [us]. Therefore, [we] went ashore immediately. All the team members and local escorts took more than twenty cars to inspect the embankment along the Hankou riverbank. At the Taikoo Wharf and the riverside railway station, [we] stopped the cars and looked down at the river, [which was] like a golden city. With this protection, the residents of Hankou will be free from flooding forever. Then, [we] drove forward, passing the transverse embankment westward. The cars stretched out like a long snake, speeding smoothly on the Zhang Gong Embankment, almost as if [we were] on a wide avenue. This embankment protects Huangtu Lake from the outside. It is more than twenty kilometers long and was built by the Hubei Flood Relief Committee. The earthwork is consolidated, and the embankment surface is wide. Observers all expressed their satisfaction. When the car arrived at Gusao Tree, the Hubei Provincial Government had prepared tea and snacks. After a brief conversation, [we] went to the Yangtze River Hotel to rest. The entire team planned to go to the upper reaches of Jingxiang and the Luohe Canal for inspection in a day or two. Because I still needed to arrange the Shanghai disaster area inspection for the three provinces of Henan, Anhui, and Hubei in Hankou, and I had to return to Shanghai to raise relief funds after the departure of the disaster area inspection team, I was unable to participate in the embankment inspection from beginning to end. However, in these five or six days, the river embankment inspection gave me a good impression. After returning to Shanghai, I will publish what I have written down every day.</p>
<p>Reader's Advisory</p>
<h3>How to Eradicate the Evil Practice of "Flower Gambling"</h3>
<p>— A Question from Mr. Chang Yiqing</p>
<p>In Shanghai newspapers, I often read about people committing suicide due to failing at flower gambling. I also read strange news about people going to temples to pray, opening coffins, dragging out corpses, burning incense to them, kowtowing, and asking them to give dreams indicating flower gambling omens. I always thought these were nonsense, probably just news reporters making up these entertaining stories to fill up space or attract readers. After living in Shanghai for several years, I realized that it was not false at all. One of my relatives, a couple, spends day and night obsessively flower gambling. Early in the morning, the first thing they ask each other is, "What did you dream of?" If he says, "I dreamed of a cat eating a mouse," then she will immediately gamble on "cat." If she says, "I dreamed of a big flood," then he will gamble on "water." If neither of them has a dream, they will go to the City God Temple to draw lots or ask for divination at a character analysis stall. The two of them gamble a total of one thousand eight hundred or three thousand taels a day. Adding her younger brother, his older brother, his older brother's wife, and her girlfriends, they only talk about flower gambling when they meet, talking about it with great interest. From the sidelines, I see that they have lost their minds. I fear that they will soon go bankrupt, losing everything they have. The prettier one might have to go to Beijing Road to "weather the storm and sleep in the dew," smiling to sell herself; the one with a face full of horizontal flesh and dull eyes might have to become a "gentleman on the roof beam," with three hands, or else they only have one path left丨丨suicide. However, if you give them sincere advice,勸them not to be obsessed with it, they will give you the cold shoulder! How has society gotten to this point? How can this phenomenon be eradicated? Your reporter has broad knowledge and deep insight into the social depths. Surely you have something to teach me.</p>
<p>Answer: Flower gambling is a symptom of the illness of modern society. Countless people are obsessed with it, leading to bankruptcy and death. Your relative's behavior is a typical example. If this phenomenon is not addressed at its root, there will be no hope of eradicating it. It is the same as with prostitutes on the street. It is definitely not something that can be accomplished by government crackdowns and prohibitions, nor by moralists "cultivating integrity and promoting morality." In short, it is an economic problem. Prostitutes do not necessarily lack a sense of shame. To be honest, their conscience of "knowing shame" is at least no less than that of today's so-called celebrities and scholars. Their law-abiding behavior is at least no worse than that of the current "knowing the law and breaking the law," "self-supervising and stealing" officials. However, they are a large group of unemployed people, with nowhere to turn, and no food or clothing. If they don't become prostitutes, what else can they do? In society, especially in today's urban society, the gap between rich and poor is too wide, and sudden riches and sudden bankruptcies are constantly emerging. This anarchic social organization encourages people to speculate every day, encourages people to take risks, encourages people to dream of "sudden wealth." The upper class engages in bidding-based production, buys racing tickets, and the lower class goes flower gambling. They are always in suspense, their nerves are tense to the extreme, because they are always going through life-and-death moments. In an instant, they can suddenly change from abject poverty to big capitalists, or they can instantly change from big capitalists to [something lower]. Although they ride in cars, drink wine, eat meat, and rest early and late, their minds are never at peace. The reason why so many people in the city have mental illnesses is also this. They are always fantasizing: winning the flower gamble, winning the lottery, making money from bidding: beautiful wives and concubines, swift horses and high carriages, plentiful food and clothing, green wine and red lights, indulgence, happiness, extreme happiness, extreme happiness! However, on the other hand, they also have infinite fear; failure in speculation will immediately make your original position plummet, "princes and grandsons, leaving buildings and palaces," falling from heaven to hell in one step. This is not an individual phenomenon, but an inevitable symptom of the entire social organization. "To kill a snake, strike its seven inches," "to kill a person, aim at the throat." Otherwise, you ban flower gambling today, and it will change its name and come back tomorrow; you ban prostitution today, and it will also change its name (like a brothel) and come back tomorrow. In fact, it has never been eradicated. Their potential force is lurking in the "blind spots" of the social organization. Therefore, the starting point of a sociologist's observation of society and a philanthropist's or moralist's observation of society is fundamentally different, and their solutions are also fundamentally different. What do you think?</p>

<h3>The Jiangsu Education Bureau Rectifies Education in Nantong and Rugao</h3>
<p>▲ Eight Points for Improving Instruction in Schools in Both Provinces</p>
<p>▲ Multiple School Principals and Teachers Replaced</p>
<p>Commissioner Zhou of the Jiangsu Education Bureau personally inspected education in northern Jiangsu this time. The inspection was extremely thorough, as reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that the inspection of Nantong and Rugao has revealed many areas needing improvement. Education in Rugao County, due to funding and factional issues, is in an even worse state than Nantong. Orders have been issued to the provincial and county education authorities to address these issues. The key points are summarized below:</p>
<p>(1) Provincial Education A. Points for Improvement Common to Schools in Nantong and Rugao: 1. Guidance counselors are not closely monitoring students' self-study. They must be ordered to conduct thorough checks. 2. Guidance personnel should regularly interact with students to understand their personalities and provide guidance accordingly. 3. All guidance counselors should live with students and not limit their duties to checking meals and lodging. 4. Teachers taking excessive leave should be strictly corrected. 5. Semester exams should cover all subjects taught during the term, without limiting the scope. 6. Clear standards for promotion and failure should be established. Students scoring below 50 should not be allowed to retake the exam. 7. Guidance personnel should be filled with capable and responsible individuals. 8. Outdated materials are being selected for Chinese language instruction. Efforts should be made to modernize the selections. B. Points for Improvement Specific to Nantong Middle School: 1. Students lack good manners, especially normal school students. This should be corrected. 2. Military training uniforms and movements are not neat. Attention should be paid to this. 3. The director of instruction should be ordered to actively improve guidance. The director of the normal school should be responsible for improving teaching and guidance. 4. Teachers Jiang Dayi and Song Shi'an's teaching methods are unsuitable and should be improved. As for teacher Chen Guoning, who teaches English, he effectively uses objects and movements to practice English, demonstrating effective and lively teaching, and should be specifically commended and rewarded. C. Points for Improvement Specific to Rugao Normal School: 1. The principal should eliminate favoritism and strive for innovation. 2. A responsible person should be quickly appointed as the director of instruction. 3. Teachers Zhi Zhexun, Chen Yun, and Sun's teaching methods should all be improved. 4. Teachers and part-time counselors Shi Zhongguang and Ding Lian neglect their teaching duties and cannot focus on their responsibilities. They are also frequently absent and should be replaced, it is said.</p>
<p>(2) County Education A. Nantong: 1. Budget allocation meetings should be held regularly. 2. Inattention is paid to school class times. Strict supervision is needed. 3. Elementary school teachers still lack a spirit of research. Efforts should be made to promote further study. 4. The private Chongjing Middle School should discontinue its high school program and focus solely on junior high school to concentrate its resources. 5. The principal of the Shiliudun Elementary School should be replaced. 6. The people's education center should be completely reorganized. 7. The Third District Education Committee member Huang Yongyan should be reprimanded and strictly assessed by the bureau. B. Rugao: 1. Educational expenditure and income do not match, and arrears are excessive. Efforts should be made to tighten the budget. 2. The education sector has divided opinions. Administrative personnel should be open and transparent in leading everyone to unite and work together. 3. The number of students in each grade is often below the required number. Consolidation should be carried out effectively. 4. The writing assignments at all levels of elementary school contain the same sentences in the same grade. This should be quickly corrected. 5. Administrative actions are often perfunctory and routine. Strict orders for improvement should be issued. 6. Education is flagging, and supervision is weak. County supervisors Zhang Yiqin and Zheng Zhenwan should be replaced by members of the Education Committee. The bureau will conduct an assessment and report the results within one month. 7. The experimental elementary school should drop the "experimental" designation. The principals of the Wu Cangdao and Nan elementary schools should be replaced. 8. The library should be merged into the park to reduce staff and expenses. 9. The experimental compulsory education area should be relocated. The experimental compulsory education area should be changed to a regular primary school. In addition to the above points, attention should be paid to correcting and guiding elementary school teachers' teaching, and supervising personnel's work, and orders should be issued separately.</p>
<p>High School Curriculum Standards (2)</p>
<p>Girls' Age, Height, and Weight Classification Table Boys' Age, Height, and Weight Classification Table</p>
<p>(4) Physical Fitness: This refers to innate ability. The relationship between this ability and physical education is the same as that between intelligence and other sciences. However, there is currently no unified standard for physical fitness testing within the physical education community. Most of the methods adopted by various schools fail to follow scientific principles. A more reliable standard is the Brace Scale of Motor Ability Tests (refer to Brace D.H. Scale of Motor Ability tests Hornesst Co. New York). However, it is still necessary to apply it with a spirit of research.</p>
<p>(5) Skills: This refers to abilities acquired through learning. Methods for testing skills can be divided into general and specific types. For example, selecting five, six, or ten natural movements from various physical activities, such as running, jumping, throwing, and tossing, can serve as a general skill test. Simple machines, such as physical strength tests, can also be used. As for specific tests, each sport has its own tests. For example, basketball can use the following tests:</p>
<p>(1) Free throw; (2) Rebound shot; (3) Passing accuracy; (4) Dribbling and shooting; (5) Passing speed.</p>
<p>Among the above five, (1) and (2) are absolutely indispensable. The other three should also be fully adopted. If it feels difficult, at least one should be selected. The following three examples are for reference:</p>
<p>Note: The relationship between grade level and performance is very close, but general grade level classifications are often neglected. It should be known that this type of classification standard can also enable each grade level to achieve its corresponding teaching results. Therefore, grade level should still be considered during classification.</p>
<p>Example (1) Breaking the Common Grade System</p>
<p>First step: According to gender, divide students in each grade into male and female groups.</p>
<p>Second step: For first-grade boys and girls, classify those who need special corrective activities into one group based on the results of physical examinations, called Group "Yu." Then, according to physical fitness or skill tests, or a combination of the two, divide the remaining students into Groups "Chou" and "Yin." Those below 30% or 40% in the entire grade are Group "Chou," and the rest are Group "Yin."</p>

<h3>A Sincere Appeal to College and University Students Nationwide to Implement Education for National Salvation (10) (2)</h3>
<p>— You Huai Gao</p>
<p>(14) The Duties of the Education for National Salvation Association: The Education for National Salvation Association established in the national capital is called the National Education for National Salvation Association. The Education for National Salvation Associations established in various provinces, regions, and cities are called the Education for National Salvation Association of a certain province, city, or region. This is an extremely important organization, the soul of the cause of Education for National Salvation, and a good doctor for saving the country. The success or failure of the endeavor almost entirely depends on them. Therefore, it is necessary to have an impartial, unbiased, fair, peaceful attitude, a broad vision, and conduct extremely careful research and discussion to produce correct recommendations, which are then implemented, so that progress can proceed without hindrance. On one hand, the government will respect and value them, and on the other hand, the public will have passionate faith in them. At the same time, they must also accept suggestions from all parties and places and work together in division of labor. At least, they must be divided into education, agriculture, forestry, fisheries, animal husbandry, botany, meteorology, veterinary medicine, military affairs, aviation, civil engineering, machinery, electrical engineering, chemistry, industry, commerce, mining and metallurgy, geography, geology, medicine, physiology, hygiene, transportation, economics, accounting, physical education, music, literature, language, and other specialized subjects. Under each specialized subject, there are further divisions into several minor subjects, and then they go to research them separately. Even with thousands of people, it is not too many. Use the strategy of concentrating talent to design a national salvation policy, and then use the central broadcasting station to broadcast educational, communication, and entertainment programs, which can provide hundreds of thousands of teachers across the country with opportunities for learning and communication every day, as well as give tens of millions of children across the country access to knowledge, and tens of millions of farmers across the country access to knowledge and entertainment.</p>
<p>I hear that there is a Yan Yangchu in Ding County, Hebei, who has many experts who have studied rural education for several years. Their achievements must be rich, and their contributions must be many. When the association is established, they should join and help. The Academia Sinica, various universities, and academic institutions across the country should all participate. This is the work and mission of the Education for National Salvation Association.</p>
<p>Fellow students of the Education for National Salvation Association, you are people who have traveled thousands of miles to study abroad. You are the most erudite people in the country. You are people who have done great things after returning home. You are people who are well aware of the shortcomings in the country. Although you have already made great contributions in schools, careers, or in the government, at most you are only seeking some benefits and reputation for a career, a family, and an individual. As for the majority of the people and the entire country, your efforts are ultimately very small. Are you at ease seeing the displacement of people across the country? Are you at ease with the increasingly severe invasion and oppression of strong neighbors? Are you at ease seeing the youth running around and shouting for help? Are you at ease doing nothing in the face of national crisis? I know that your hearts must be uneasy. You are still in your prime. If you can spontaneously organize an Education for National Salvation Association to assist the youth, then you can be considered to have fulfilled your responsibilities.</p>
<p>(15) Important Work Within Ten Years</p>
<p>The grand strategy of Education for National Salvation is to take education as the foundation, teachers as the backbone, and schools as the administrative organs. Therefore, in addition to educating children, it is also necessary to undertake many major tasks. The first important task is investigation. Take one county as a unit, unite the teachers in the county, and conduct a detailed investigation. The most important thing is, of course, the population. The rest, such as products, resources, soil, climate, and all kinds of local customs, must be investigated clearly and reported to the association. The forms, of course, will be issued by the association. Fill them out according to the form, put them together, and complete the national statistics. It is also necessary to organize a surveying team, measure the terrain, and draw precise maps, which will make great contributions to military affairs, politics, and commerce. There are also six major things in my imagination that I would like you to accomplish:</p>
<p>Opening up wasteland and carrying out immigration;</p>
<p>Adding side businesses and increasing income;</p>
<p>Building roads and dredging rivers to facilitate transportation;</p>
<p>Improving species and increasing production;</p>
<p>Improving customs and implementing civil governance;</p>
<p>Building forests and preventing floods.</p>
<p>If you can accomplish the above tasks within ten years, you will be considered the pillars of the country and the pillars of society, and you will be true saviors of China.</p>
<p>Third step: Divide the second and third grade boys and girls according to the second step. However, divide the students who do not need correction into three groups. Those with scores in the lowest 25% or 30% are Group "Chou", those with scores in the highest 25% or 30% are Group "Mao", and the rest in the middle are Group "Yin".</p>
<p>Fourth step: Combine the groups divided in the second and third steps. Yu joins Yu to form Group A, Chou joins Chou to form Group B, Yin joins Yin to form Group C, and Mao is Group D. Thus, all male and female students in the school are divided into four groups: A, B, C, and D. Fifth step: If there are many students and more than one teacher, then the above four groups can still be further divided into several groups as follows:</p>
<p>Group A can be further divided according to individual circumstances, grouping those with similar defects together.</p>
<p>Groups B and C can be further divided according to age, height, and weight.</p>
<p>Group D can choose various elective subjects according to students' interests, such as martial arts, competitive sports, technical sports, dance, etc., and then form groups.</p>
<p>Note: If classes are organized according to this example, it is necessary to pay attention to the schedule. It is best to dedicate every afternoon after 3:00 PM to physical education time and not schedule other classes.</p>
<p>Example (2) Following the Common Grade System</p>
<p>First step: Divide the class into male and female groups.</p>
<p>Second step: Based on the results of physical examinations, divide the students in each class who need special corrective exercises into one group, and then divide the rest into several groups according to age, height, weight, physical fitness, or skills. They still attend classes in the same class, but use a group teaching method. Each group sets up a group leader to help the teacher be responsible for order and leadership. The teacher must provide additional guidance and teaching to the group leader.</p>
<p>Example (3) Harmonizing the above two examples:</p>
<p>Organize teaching time according to Example (2) and practice time according to Example (1).</p>
<h3>Graduation Certificates for Graduation Examinations Still Prepared by Each School</h3>
<p>▲ Zhejiang Education Department Instructs Provincial No. 10 Middle School</p>
<p>(Hangzhou News) The Department of Education recently received a request from Provincial No. 10 Middle School for clarification on whether graduation certificates for graduation examinations should still be prepared by the school. The Department has instructed that the certificates should still be prepared by the school. The original text is as follows: Received and noted. Graduation certificates should still be prepared by the school itself.

<h3>New Initiatives in the Central Music Department</h3>
<p>Tang Xueyong, a professor of central music, deeply feels the importance of clan order and organization. According to him, it is based on music education and cultivation. He believes that the rhythm and harmony within music are physical symbols of order and organization. Furthermore, the alluring power of music can unconsciously cultivate people's love for order and organization. Therefore, in recent years, the professor has strived to improve the music department of Central University. In addition to classifying and reorganizing the original courses, all teaching rules and academic systems are also based on European and continental standards. This semester, with the school's enthusiastic support, Mrs. Siebertmann from Germany has been hired as a piano professor, and Mr. Straus from Austria has been hired as a vocal music professor. It is learned that Mrs. Siebertmann has been a teacher at the Karlruhe and Stuttgart music academies in Germany for many years. She is a famous disciple of Mau Pauer, a professor at the Leipzig University of Music. As for Mr. Straus, he is the director of music at the Vienna Temple and the conductor of the Vienna City Choir. Both professors have now arrived at the school and are teaching.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou Boy Scout Curriculum Competition</h3>

<h3>Municipal Education Bureau Compiles Intelligence Tests for Lower Grades of Elementary School</h3>
<p>▲ Plans to First Test 10,000 Students Aged Three to Nine</p>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau, in view of the fact that intelligence tests are helpful for entrance grading and all aspects of teaching, and that the only individual intelligence test compiled in China is the Binet-Simon Intelligence Test compiled by the Chinese Education Improvement Society six years ago, which is complicated and requires expensive testing materials, making it unsuitable for general elementary schools, has adopted the American Bauder Maze Intelligence Test material to compile a simpler and more economical intelligence test. It plans to test 10,000 children aged three to nine in the city's elementary schools, and then organize and study the testing materials of these 10,000 children, and compile a standard intelligence test for children in the city using statistical methods. This type of test, once compiled, will not only be convenient for use by the city's elementary schools, but will also make a considerable contribution to academics. It is now planned to proceed, and will be distributed to various schools for testing soon.</p>
<h3>Revival of the White Goose Painting Society</h3>
<p>The White Goose Painting Society, a famous art group, was established in the spring of 1927. It was organized by painters Chen Qiucao, Fang Xuegu, and Pan Sitong, and stood out and was well-known at the time. In the autumn of 1928, the White Goose Painting Research Institute was established to implement the exhibition plan, and it was painstakingly managed and achieved rapid results. The January 28th Incident suddenly broke out, and the area was the war zone. Unfortunately, everything was destroyed. People who heard about it expressed deep regret. Afterwards, the main figures Chen, Fang, and Pan, with the spirit of sacrificing for art, worked hard to restore it. After a year, preparations have now been completed, and approval has been obtained from the education authorities to complete the record-filing procedures. At the same time, in order to improve the organization, the former research institute was reorganized into a painting tutoring school, specializing in providing general enthusiasts who are already employed with opportunities for study.

<h3>Donghua Wins Lux 3 to 2</h3>
<p>=Losing Two Goals in a Row, the Situation Is Critical=</p>
<p>=Scoring Three Goals in a Row, the Spirits Soar=</p>
<p>Lux was aggressively pressing and scored two goals in a row, shocking Donghua and making them think that their position could not be maintained. Fortunately, with a final burst of effort, three goals were scored in succession, and Donghua ultimately reversed the defeat with a score of 3-2. At yesterday's baseball field, there were over 7,000 spectators. The day was very clear and full of the breath of spring. Every fan, after rubbing their cheeks and scratching their ears in anxiety and worry, felt even more joy from the final outcome.</p>
<p>One Goal Lost in Just Two Minutes Donghua kicked off but did not score. Lux was powerful and imposing, pressing aggressively. Fans sent the ball to the left, Alger broke in from the edge, and passed it in front of the goal. Donghua's Li Ning and Tu Kaiyuan both failed to intercept it. Lux's center forward, Bolden, headed the ball, but it was also intercepted. Right wing Ding Maida rushed forward and kicked hard, with great force. The ball flew into the net like an arrow leaving the bowstring. It was a beautiful sight, stunning the audience. It was only two minutes into the game.</p>
<p>Another City Lost on a Twelve-Yard Penalty After Lux scored a goal, their momentum increased. The entire team pressed forward, and Donghua was in a state of crisis. Lu Zhongen escaped danger twice and immediately counterattacked. Chen Jiaqiu kicked a free kick in front of the enemy's goal, but the goalkeeper saved it. Feng You shot from afar and missed the goal. Yi Chen Hongguang engaged in close combat and invaded again, but there was no opportunity to score. Jiaqiu supported from the side and back-hooked a shot, but it also went wild. Then Lux led their troops to charge forward, their momentum surging. Li Ning's hooked ball touched his hand, resulting in a twelve-yard penalty. It could be said that misfortunes never come singly. Bolden kicked the ball in again, adding another goal. Within twenty minutes, Donghua lost two goals in a row, and the situation became even more critical. The audience all thought that the position could not be maintained.</p>
<h3>Southern California University Football Coach</h3>
<p>Annual Salary of 12,000 Gold Dollars</p>
<p>▲Howard H. Jones Renews Contract for Five Years</p>
<p>Los Angeles, December 7th News. Howard H. Jones, the famous American football coach, recently renewed a long-term contract with the University of Southern California for five years, exclusively serving as the school's football coach, with an annual salary of 12,000 gold dollars. Howard Jones has been the football coach at the University of Southern California for eight years. Not only does he make the players extremely obedient to sportsmanship, but in those eight years, he won a total of seventy-two games, lost only ten, and drew two. He truly deserves to be called a famous coach.</p>
<p>Donghua Attacked Repeatedly Without Success At this time, Donghua's formation appeared neat, but the players' actions were quite slow. The center-back line was also weak, and defender Li Ning had lost his prestige. The ball was often on the enemy's feet. Lux ran quickly and kicked crisply. Because Donghua's momentum was weak, Lux's sharpness was even more apparent. After losing two goals, they were forced to cheer up. Wan Xianghua invaded several times, but at the critical moment, he was intercepted by the enemy. Feng Yunyou kicked a high ball towards the goal, and Jiaqiu followed up. This ball had a chance to enter the goal, but in a hurry, Jiaqiu actually used his hand to slap the ball into the goal. Lux benefited from the misfortune, while Donghua was in vain.</p>
<p>A Twelve-Yard Penalty in Return After a long time of melee, Lux defender Nie Guwu was injured and left the field. He was replaced by center forward Bauer Deng Bao. This person was simple-minded and dull. Lux's rear was suddenly weakened, and the power of the forward was also reduced. Therefore, Lux's momentum gradually declined. Donghua took the opportunity to attack. Wan Xianghua sent out a corner kick with a good landing point. You grabbed and I stole, and a fierce melee ensued. Bauer Deng Bao made a mistake and was penalized with a twelve-yard penalty. Li Yichen took the penalty kick and flew the ball into the corner of the goal, registering a goal first. Donghua's fortune turned around. At the interval, the first half ended immediately.</p>
<p>Jiaqiu Scores a Goal with a Header As the fighting resumed, Donghua charged down in one go. Wan Xianghua went deep into enemy territory but returned without success. Lux's left and right forwards shot unsuccessfully one after another. Donghua took advantage of the enemy's fatigue to invade again. Wan Xianghua passed the ball skillfully, and goalkeeper David failed to save it. Jiaqiu met the ball with his head and used his strength to head it in. Seven thousand pairs of eyes sent the ball flying into the goal, making the score 2-2. Donghua was beaming with joy, and the final victory seemed to be in sight.</p>
<p>Chen Yutian Turns Defeat into Victory After the colors were evenly matched, Donghua's forwards became sharper. The ball fled east and west in the enemy's camp, only killing the Northern barbarians and preventing them from grazing their horses southward. Fans were exhausted and difficult to resist. Kirkren was panting and sweating. The forward formation was disorganized, and the defense was unprepared. Donghua was eager to win and did not slack off. Wan Xianghua received a pass from Hongguang and sent the ball smoothly in front of the goal. Fans failed to grab it, and Chen Yutian took the opportunity to kick the ball, breaking through the enemy's goal again. After that, the offense and defense of both sides were mediocre until the final whistle, and Donghua finally won 3-2. Li Ning was seriously injured and left the field in the last five minutes, and we hope he will recover soon. The lineups are as follows:</p>
<p>▲Donghua Club</p>
<p>Lu Zhongen Li Ning Guan Xun'an Tu Kaiyuan Feng Yunyou Wu Youliang Wan Xianghua Chen Hongguang Li Yichen Chen Jiaqiu Chen Yutian</p>

<h3>Retrospection and Prospects for the Financial Industry</h3>
<p>— Wang Yutong</p>
<p>Another year passes easily, and it is again the time when the year ends and spring returns. As we recall the national crisis since the September 18th Incident, it has already been a hasty year. During this year, what we have personally experienced has been the continuous external troubles and the frequent internal worries. Beset by both internal and external difficulties, the national fate is barely sustained, like a bird's nest on a dangerous egg. The urgency of the disaster can be said to be the only one since the Republic of China. The impact on the financial industry, which controls the economic hub of society, is particularly severe. When the Northeast warned of the September 18th Incident, the financial situation suddenly became extremely tight, and the securities market prices plummeted. Before long, the January 28th Shanghai Incident occurred again, and the situation became more serious. The atmosphere was tense, and there was a general sense of impending doom. Fortunately, although the financial community was in the midst of this great pain, it was able to make early preparations and mutual warnings for the occurrence of the incident. The temporary response was adequate, and it was able to maintain itself with difficulty. When the situation was urgent, it adopted a method of common cooperation, so that all bills were handled according to the method of remittance, and the industry tried its best to save the payment of cash. On the one hand, it was agreed that the deadline for the year-end settlement of accounts for the Spring Festival would be extended. At the same time, it would not remit money to foreign banks, and foreign banks also expressed that they would not take the opportunity to accept deposits. As a result, the current financial situation was stabilized. Soon after, the organization of the Joint Reserve Bank was established, and the Qian industry also established a special property custody committee. Although these are all temporary and hasty designs, we can also see the financial community's painstaking efforts to cope with the environment.</p>
<p>The main purpose of this article is to discuss the future trend of the financial industry. However, if we want to find a solution, we should first conduct a full review of the past achievements of the financial industry, so that we can learn from the past and know the future, and perhaps find an appropriate strategy.</p>
<p>In today's autumn of industrial and commercial decline and rising unemployment everywhere, the urban economy, relying on agile and powerful financial turnover, shows a unique form of development. This is indeed the biggest mistake of the financial industry in the past, and there is no need to shy away from it. Just look at the most significant phenomena in the financial industry in the past one or two years and in this year, and you can get the following:</p>
<p>㈠ Excessive issuance of public bonds Since the Republic of China, there have been a total of fifty-four or five types of public bonds issued, and among them, since the establishment of the National Government, the types of bonds issued in the five years from the 16th to the 20th year accounted for twenty-six types, and the total amount of issuance was 100.12 million yuan. In terms of each year, the number of issues in the 16th year was 76.09074 million yuan, 17th year was 10.3 million yuan, 18th year was 24.3 million yuan, 19th year was 17.4 million yuan, and 20th year was 41.6 million yuan. The reason why such a huge amount could be issued is mainly due to the decline of industry and commerce in various places, the concentration of idle funds, and the decline in the price of silver. The people felt that the price of bonds had fallen and the interest rate was generous. The government was also using this to cater to the psychology of the people. The bonds were issued without limit, so as to enrich the temporary income. Both the top and the bottom had their own interests. As a result, the bonds were full of the market, and the price of the bonds lost its fixed nature, and the rise and fall were extremely huge as the situation changed.</p>
<p>㈡ Excessive issuance of banknotes The increase or decrease in the amount of currency should be determined according to the needs of the market. However, in our country, the increasing issuance of banknotes by various banks in recent years is not due to an actual increase in demand, but because of the huge amount of public bonds issued. As a result, it directly creates the basis for inflation and indirectly increases the opportunity for credit to shake. According to the total amount of issuance by various banks, in Shanghai alone, it was 120 million yuan in the 17th year and 240 million yuan in the 20th year, an increase of one time. However, recently, due to the depression of all industries, the amount of issuance by various banks has been greatly reduced.</p>
<p>㈢ Sharp drop in foreign silver After the Shenyang Incident, the silver reserves in Shanghai suddenly increased, and the price of foreign silver fell sharply. In June of this year, it actually fell to 6 qian 8 fen 8 li 125. This is indeed because various financial institutions are engaged in planning ahead, sucking up cash, so as to strengthen their strength. However, when the market cash is once flooded to this point, the long-term cause is the collapse of the rural economy in various places and the concentration of funds in cities. Since the Shanghai Incident, it has been due to the abnormal financial season, the decline of urban industry and commerce, and the general public's practice of storing cash to prepare for emergencies. For a time, it became a common practice, and the speed of cash circulation suddenly decreased, and the phenomenon of accumulation was achieved.</p>
<p>㈣ The investment boom in real estate In recent years, Shanghai's real estate business has sprung up, and the most prosperous period should be the 19th year of the Republic of China. The degree of development was the only one in previous years. It is estimated that in the most recent five years, the total value of Shanghai's real estate has increased by 200 million taels, and the increase in the 19th year accounted for half of it. At that time, real estate companies emerged like mushrooms after a spring rain. Many banks engaged in real estate investment or speculation as a sideline, and foreign businessmen also invested in real estate because the price of silver was low and there was no way to remit it abroad. The abnormal development of this kind of real estate transaction was actually because the funds in the mainland were absorbed and concentrated in Shanghai, which helped to achieve it. After entering the 20th year of the Republic of China, the trend of real estate transactions gradually declined, but the real estate business is still the object of envy for the general public.</p>
<p>The phenomena of the financial industry in the past are summarized as above. Therefore, those of us who live in Shanghai are struck by the prosperity of the city. The funds in the interior, for the sake of profit, are all absorbed and concentrated in Shanghai. The prosperity and decline of the economy between large cities and towns is becoming more and more obvious. Following this, the inherent industry and commerce suddenly lost the regulation of finance. In addition, the economic imperialism from abroad continued to invade, and the government's donations and taxes became more and more burdensome. Since it could no longer bear the burden, it was dying. The most obvious examples are the early failures of the silk, tea, and silk industries. Therefore, we only see stores closing down and factories stopping in the city, and thousands of workers are tragically unemployed. As for the countryside, in addition to being severely affected by the urban economic depression, the rural areas themselves are becoming more and more collapsed, and the situation is even more serious. For many years, due to the reduction of natural time and human affairs, famines have been reported repeatedly. Although this autumn is said to be a good harvest, according to the survey, the cost of farming one mu of farmland for farmers in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces ranges from ten yuan to thirteen yuan. After selling it, it is necessary to lose three yuan per mu. This is all that farmers get from rice production. As for other by-products such as mulberry, hemp, beans, and millet, they are also desperate due to reduced demand and poor quality. When the Chinese Economic Society held its annual meeting this autumn, I accompanied them to investigate the economic conditions in various places. During my travels, I heard the county magistrates of Jinhua and Lanxi report on the bankruptcy of the local rural economy, the decline of industry and commerce, the increase in unemployment, and the deep pain suffered by all parties, and the eagerness to find relief. It can be seen that the decline of urban industry and commerce and the economy between rural areas is becoming more and more serious. All of this is what the financial industry should change its goals in the future and pay close attention to.</p>
<p>Moreover, I have further progress. Since the price of silver has fallen and our country's customs duties have increased, foreign goods, except for Japanese goods, and generally expensive imported goods, have gradually become popular in various markets in our country. As a result, the domestic small industries, which were originally in a state of exploitation and oppression by imperial capitalism, have been able to benefit a little and gradually show signs of recovery and prosperity. Among them, there are quite a few excellent and promising ones, but most of them are troubled by the difficulty of capital turnover, resulting in insufficient development, and often miss good opportunities. This is a major economic loss for the country and for the society. I deeply hope that bankers with general awareness and sharp vision can change their long-standing policy of sitting idly by and provide practical and powerful assistance, so as to seek the recovery and expansion of the productive capacity of our country's industrial circles. At this point, I dare to tell the financial industry of our country that if the financial industry wants to seek proper survival and development in the future, it will not be enough to talk about the new mission of the financial industry in the mid-twenties without abandoning its struggle for profit from public bonds and real estate and shifting its goal to developing production and rescuing the rural economy.</p>
<h3>The War Debt Problem</h3>
<p>— Jian Chu</p>
<p>In June of this year, before the Lausanne Conference was held, the Washington government warned all debtor nations to refrain from any solidarity aimed at resisting the United States. However, debtor nations forming groups to negotiate their own obligations was deemed acceptable. Therefore, the Lausanne Conference ultimately resulted in an agreement among the various nations.</p>
<p>On the surface, the results of the conference showed Germany's reparations being reduced from a staggering amount to 7.14 billion, with the ability of the German people to pay being the standard. In reality, the agreement had other intentions behind it: it was conditional upon the United States modifying or canceling war debts, and would only be presented after the US elections. Therefore, within a week of the US elections, various nations swiftly and decisively employed diplomatic means to declare their inability to pay the war debts as scheduled.</p>
<p>It is a reality that Germany can no longer bear the burden of reparations and is unable to pay, as proven by international committees and economic experts. The outcome of the Lausanne Agreement was inevitable, and the United States' actions were also a necessary consequence. For the past two years, the core of the entire problem has been how the United States would handle it. When Congress passed the Hoover Moratorium last year, it clearly stipulated that the President could not make similar concessions again without the consent of Congress.</p>
<p>Both the Democratic and Republican parties in Congress oppose modifying or canceling war debts, and President Hoover has also explicitly stated his opposition to cancellation. However, prolonging the war debt issue is most detrimental to international trade, and it is not in the best interests of any nation. Therefore, there is an urgent need for adjustment. The Lausanne Conference was postponed until after the French elections, and the request for a moratorium was delayed until after the US elections. The politicians' avoidance of responsibility is evident, but it is of some small benefit to the war debt problem itself. It was almost impossible for France to make concessions in Lausanne during the presidential campaign, and the same goes for the United States. The war debt problem is complex and cannot be resolved during the heated campaign period with all the shouting and clamoring.</p>
<p>Germany was able to have its reparations modified as a result of publicly acknowledging its poverty and inability to pay. While Britain, France, and other debtor nations have made similar requests, they have not made similar acknowledgments. Their intentions are self-evident. If an agreement to modify war debts is difficult to achieve, they will only resort to delaying tactics to buy time. Their aim in requesting the modification of war debts is to offset the income from German reparations. The United States firmly refuses to modify the debts and denies any connection between war debts and reparations, but the facts show that there is a causal relationship between the two.</p>
<p>Those who advocate for modification also have their reasons: the drastic fall in prices means that more exports are needed to pay off American debts. Due to the continuous decline of the pound, the amount paid by Britain has increased from £37,860,000 to £54,518,000. The United States' firm rejection of the debtor nations' requests is also based on reason. The debtor nations' repeated requests are nothing more than excuses of poverty and inability to pay, while their military spending is enormous. Isn't this just being deliberately difficult to evade obligations? In 1931, Britain's military spending was three times greater than its payments to the United States, France's was thirteen times, Italy's was twenty times, and Belgium's was five times. Are these nations truly poor? Therefore, the US authorities have always believed that war debts are related to military spending, and war debts are closely related to arms reduction. If Britain can agree to reduce its military spending to the extent desired by the United States, then the time for a new war debt conference will be ripe.</p>
<p>In their memoranda, Britain and France strongly advocate reopening the conference for a comprehensive discussion and extending the Hoover Moratorium. The US Congress can reject this, but the trend is towards resolving the war debt issue at the upcoming international economic conference next spring. Although US political parties have declared that the issue of international debts should not be on the agenda of the international economic conference, a final solution must be reached in a timely manner, otherwise the consequences will be endless and the future unimaginable. In the near future, the world may see new developments, trade barriers may be removed, and the recovery of prosperity may be just around the corner.</p>
<h3>A Simple Explanation of Modern Currency (4)</h3>
<p>— Translated by Ke</p>
<p>Chapter 2: The Standard of Currency (Continued)</p>
<p>Suppose now that the industrial or commercial uses of silver decrease, then the price of raw silver will inevitably fall and not be able to compensate for the interest taken from other things, but its qualification as legal tender has not been lost, and the people can pay all debts with silver coins and preserve the coin for taking goods. Once the price is stable, there is still extra profit to be made by paying everything with it. Therefore, everyone will compete to buy raw silver for use, and the result of this competition can immediately increase the price of silver. At the same time, the need for gold as legal tender decreases, and the advantage of gold being easier to obtain and having a higher price disappears. In this situation, the price of gold and silver will always exist at a comparable ratio. Although there will be rises and falls in the interval, they will all be short-lived.</p>
<p>To reach this stage, it is necessary to first reduce all free and competitive markets to the extreme, so that they can only be controlled by controlling prices.</p>
<p>Today, a large number of people enthusiastically advocate the adoption of a bimetallic standard. Among those who support this theory are all kinds of people: the owners of silver mines want to increase the use of silver in order to raise the price of silver; merchants involved in trade with the Far East want to raise the price of silver in order to increase the purchasing power of silver-using countries like China and India; economists believe that the supply of gold is limited and insufficient for all uses and seek to fill the gap with silver; idealists want to consolidate the position of prosperity by adjusting the two; and politicians hope to realize these ideals to promote political power. Although their aims are different, their advocacy for the adoption of a bimetallic standard is the same.</p>
<p>The content of this issue is worthy of further study, but for the sake of brevity, it will be left for further discussion later, and we will first look at other key points of currency.</p>
<p>Note 1) In fact, the weight of subsidiary coins does not have to be equal to the weight of bullion, because if the quantity is too heavy, it will make its use inconvenient. The national treasury should also always keep a sufficient supply of current coins for redemption, and must keep a certain amount of bullion, which can be used for exchange at any time. However, the price of pure silver contained in the coin should not exceed the price of its bullion. If this were to happen, general profit-seekers would collect coins and melt them for other uses, because they are cheaper than buying bullion for use, or they would melt them into bullion and then exchange them for a larger number of coins from the coin mint. (End of this chapter)</p>
<h3>Several Simple Methods for Calculating Bond Investment Returns</h3>
<p>— Wang Dunfu</p>
<p>People use capital in different ways, some deposit it in banks, some buy company stocks, and others buy government bonds. However, interest rates on bank deposits are not very high, and buying stocks carries the risk of losing capital. Therefore, when choosing an undecided company, it is more appropriate to buy government bonds to avoid interest losses. Because the interest on government bonds is relatively higher and more secure than other stocks. If there is an urgent need or a desire to make other investments, one can request a mortgage from the bank or sell them on the market at any time. Turnover is very convenient, making them a suitable investment target.</p>
<p>Some people believe that while bond investments are convenient for turnover, the country's financial situation is somewhat poor, and there may be concerns about investment security. Honestly, although the country's finances have been strained in recent years, the principal and interest payments on bonds have been made on time. After the January 28th Incident last year, the plan to postpone and reduce interest clearly stipulated that 8.6 million yuan would be allocated from customs duties each month as a fund for various debts, which would be a permanent arrangement. Regardless of how difficult the finances become in the future, the aforementioned fund must not be shaken in the slightest, and no further changes should be made. As a result, the national debt fund has become more stable.</p>
<p>In this light, bond investments are indeed more secure than other securities. However, the benefits obtained by bond investors cannot be generalized, as the terms of various bonds differ. Although interest rates are now uniform, the terms vary in length, the amount of principal repaid varies, market prices vary, and the benefits vary. The calculation of benefits is commonly called "interest compounding." The Japanese translate the English word "Yield" as "利迥 (lì jiǒng)". Generally, it is divided into two types: current yield and redemption yield.</p>
<p>(1) Current Yields: Current yield is also called direct yield, which is calculated by dividing the interest income by the purchase price. For example, if an 8% interest bond is purchased at 80% of its face value, then the current yield is 10%.</p>
<p>(2) Redemption Yields: Redemption yield is also called indirect yield, which is the current yield, adjusted by the profit or loss from the repayment of principal. For premium bonds, the redemption yield is lower than the current yield. For discount bonds, the redemption yield is higher than the current yield. This type of yield calculation takes the entire term of the bond as the standard, so it is also called the final yield. If the bond is redeemed in the middle of the term, then it is called the intermediate yield, and if one happens to buy a bond that is then redeemed, then it is called the initial yield.</p>
<p>What we want to calculate now is the redemption yield. There are detailed bond value tables and bond yield tables available abroad, and we can simply look up the tables without any need for calculation. There are also complete annuity tables, which can be used to apply the compound interest algorithm of annuities to obtain more accurate results. However, the current situation with our bonds is more complicated than in Europe and America. The very detailed bond value tables and yield tables of Europe and America are not applicable. At most, we can buy treasury bills on the market, and the amounts of principal repaid vary, with no fixed rules. It is also not convenient to apply the compound interest algorithm of annuities, and the level of knowledge of the general merchant is somewhat lacking. Therefore, the bond yield can only be calculated using some simple and straightforward algorithms, seeking only to be broadly correct and not necessarily perfectly accurate. The following five algorithms are all collected based on this standard. The first four are applicable to bonds that are redeemed by lottery, and the last one is applicable to treasury bills that are redeemed in installments.</p>
<p>Now, let's describe them in detail.</p>
<p>(A) Bond Yield Calculation: Bond yield calculation is divided into four types: average algorithm, Wall Street customary algorithm, Ho Kai algorithm, and difference annuity algorithm. The Wall Street customary algorithm is more accurate.</p>
<p>(1) Average Algorithm: The average algorithm is a simple interest algorithm, also called the averaging algorithm. The yield obtained seems to be somewhat high, and this method has now been abolished in European and American countries. The formula is as follows:</p>
<p>Face Value - Purchase Price</p>
<p>(Face Value × Face Value Interest Rate) + | | | | | | | | | | | |</p>
<p>Yield = | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | ··················(1)</p>
<p>Purchase Price</p>
<p>The above formula is for calculating discount bonds. If it is a premium bond, then the formula is as follows:</p>
<p>Purchase Price - Face Value</p>
<p>(Face Value × Face Value Interest Rate) | | | | | | | | | | | | |</p>
<p>Yield = | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | ·················(2)</p>
<p>Purchase Price</p>
<p>(2) Wall Street Customary Algorithm (Thumb Method): This is the algorithm commonly used on Wall Street in New York, and it is also divided into premium and discount types. However, one thing to note is that if the premium or discount difference is large, and the term of the principal repayment is very long, this algorithm is not very applicable.</p>
<p>(A) Premium Algorithm</p>
<p>(i) Calculate the difference between the face value and the premium.</p>
<p>(ii) Divide the difference in premium by the term of repayment to obtain the approximate amount of the average annual allocation of the premium difference.</p>
<p>(iii) Subtract the approximate amount of the average annual allocation of the premium difference from the total annual interest income.</p>
<p>(iv) Divide the result of the third step by the purchase price of the ticket.</p>
<p>(v) Divide the result of the third step by the sum of the face value and the average annual allocation of the interest difference.</p>
<p>(vi) Find the average of the fourth and fifth steps. This average is the yield rate of the bond. If it is written as a formula, it is as follows:</p>
<p>(Face Value × Interest Rate) - (Purchase Price - Face Value) (Face Value × Interest Rate) - (Purchase Price - Face Value)</p>
<p>| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |/Term of Years | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |/Term of Years</p>
<p>Yield= | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | + | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | ÷······(3)</p>
<p>Purchase Price / Face Value</p>
<p>Purchase Price Face Value + | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |</p>
<p>Term of Years</p>
<p>(B) Discount Algorithm</p>
<p>(i) Calculate the difference between the discount and the face value.</p>
<p>(ii) Divide the difference in discount by the term of repayment (i.e., the difference benefit) to obtain the approximate amount of the average annual allocation of the discount difference.</p>
<p>(iii) Add the approximate amount of the average annual allocation of the discount difference to the total annual interest income.</p>
<p>(iv) Divide the result of the third step by the purchase price.</p>
<p>(v) Divide the result of the third step by the difference between the face value of the bond and the average annual allocation of the discount difference.</p>
<p>(vi) Find the average of the fourth and fifth steps. This average is the bond yield rate.</p>
<p>The above six steps are written as the following formula:</p>
<p>(Face Value × Interest Rate) + (Face Value - Purchase Price) (Face Value × Interest Rate) + (Face Value - Purchase Price)</p>
<p>| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |/Term of Years | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |/Term of Years</p>
<p>Yield= | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | + | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | + 2 ·····(4)</p>
<p>Face Value - Purchase Price</p>
<p>Purchase Price / Face Value - | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |</p>
<p>Term of Years</p>
<p>If formula (iv) is slightly modified, it becomes the following formula:</p>
<p>(Face Value × Interest Rate) + (Face Value - Purchase Price) / Term of Years + 1</p>
<p>Yield= | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | + Face Value | | | | | | | | (Face Value - Purchase Price) ······(5) (To be continued)</p>
<p>Term of Years / Term of Years × 2 Limit</p>

<p>Thin Rice Prices Rose and then Plunged 4 Jiao</p>
<p>Over 2,000 Shi Opened for Sale</p>
<p>(Shanghai South) Over 40 boats arrived. However, due to the soaring prices of thin rice at the packaging shops in recent days, buyers used the change as a reason to claim that the rice per shi was not up to par. Even after the price was set, they wanted to return it, causing disputes between the two parties and disrupting the market. After repeated negotiations, they agreed to reduce the price, and the price of thin rice plummeted by 4 jiao. Over 2,000 shi were sold. The Suzhou and Tongxiang gangs, due to the storage of thin rice in Hexia, still had good sales in the shops inside and outside the city. The situation showed a firm price of 1 jiao per shi. As for the Changxiang gang, Yinyuan, Dujian, Yangjian, etc., the prices remained stable.</p>

<h3>General Miscellaneous Grains Market All Appear Quiet</h3>
<p>丨Previously Arrived Xiang Rice Half Sold Yesterday丨</p>
<p>"Indica Rice": Of the previously arrived Xiang rice, half was sold yesterday. The Jiyuan rice was handled by this street for 316 bags. Machine oil and machine red rice were taken by the Fujian gang for over 800 bags. Because of the procurement of military rice in various producing areas, cargo owners in Shanghai are urgently calling for higher prices, looking at a higher future market. "Soybeans": The appetite has decreased, but internal movements in the street are causing factory owners to take a wait-and-see attitude, and the market appears soft. Broad beans were handled by the Guangdong gang for over 450 bags. "Sesame": Sales continue, but without large appetites. The market is stable.</p>
<p>"Wheat": No new arrivals. The foreign wheat exchange rate is not favorable. There is appetite but no goods. "Rapeseed": There is also activity but no market. The selling prices of guest machine rice and broad beans from the Miscellaneous Grains Association are listed on the left:</p>
<p>▲Machine Rice　　　　　▲Yellow Broad Beans　　　　　▲Sand Yellow Beans</p>
<p>Xiang Machine Yuan 9.50　Siping Street Yellow 4.39　Chongming Sand Yellow 2.95</p>
<p>To 9.40　Zhengyangguan Yellow 3.96　　　　To 2.90</p>
<p>Also Machine Oil 9.10　Pinghu Broad Beans 3.91　▲Sesame</p>
<p>To 8.80　　　　To 2.9　　Nansuzhou White 7.25</p>
<p>Also Machine Red 8.70　Pudong Broad Beans 3.95　　　　To 7.30</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea</h3>
<p>No New Developments in Domestic and Foreign Silk Markets at the Start of the Year</p>
<p>The past week coincided with the New Year. Silk factories in New York, Lyon, and England had just resumed work after the holidays. The market has ample silk reserves. Cloth factories are taking a wait-and-see attitude toward purchases. However, sock factories and others continue to purchase spot goods, with Japanese silk accounting for nine-tenths. European and American Chinese silk telegrams are slow, only general households and machine factories are processing. The old silk inventory of various manufacturers is gradually decreasing. Domestic silk is not cheap and maintains a firm attitude, all waiting for prices to rise before selling. Therefore, domestic and foreign silk sales have no new developments. Only over 200 bales of spot silk were transacted in Shanghai, but wheel exports are brisk, totaling over 1,500 pieces.</p>
<h3>Metals</h3>
<p>Foreign Dollar Starts to Fall Back</p>
<p>Since the exchange rate between British and American currencies has fallen, the prices of various metal goods have been raised one after another. Even old iron products have soared. However, in recent days, due to the large impact of the battle at Shanhaiguan, the foreign dollar exchange rate seems to be starting to fall back. The current market price is 3 taels and 9 mace per dan, down 3 mace from before. The dark market price is said to be as low as 3 taels and 7.5 mace. The prices of white lead sheets, horseshoe nails, and small hobnails traded yesterday are listed below (unit: taels):</p>
<p>▲White Lead Sheet　　　　▲Horseshoe Nails　　　　▲Small Hobnails</p>

<h3>Hunan Pure Antimony and Green Lead Have Been Shipped</h3>
<p>Hunan pure antimony and green lead, over 700 pieces were shipped from Hankou yesterday (200 boxes of pure antimony and over 500 bars of green lead), unloaded at Jardine Matheson and Jinliyuan. The price of antimony is 250 taels per ton, and lead is 12 taels.</p>
<h3>Coal</h3>
<p>White Coal Market Price Soars</p>
<p>Since the Shanhaiguan incident, the Shanghai coal industry fears that transportation will be hindered, and the market is extremely chaotic. By yesterday afternoon, the prices of various types of white coal soared unusually. Hongqi, Marc, Annam and other lump coals rose 7.5 mace per ton. Haifeng Mentougou rose 5 mace, Shanxi rose 1 tael, and Liujiang and Great Wall rose 1 tael and 2.5 mace. The prices of sub-quality tong and small coal traded yesterday are listed below (unit: taels):</p>
<p>▲Sub-Quality Tong</p>

<h3>On Publicity</h3>
<p>— Zhao Mianzhi</p>
<p>Imagine, a price reduction is already cheap, a big price reduction is naturally even more of a bargain. Moreover, there are additional most favorable conditions such as "half price on the marked price", "buy one get one free", and "additional gifts". The result of the transaction must be that both the buyer and the seller think they are getting a bargain, with no one losing out. Both sides benefit, which is truly mutually beneficial.</p>
<p>However, getting a bargain for oneself may mean someone else loses out, and losing out oneself means someone else gets a bargain. These are things that should be considered. Not wanting to lose out oneself and ignoring whether others lose out. Business deals are based on this principle, and taking advantage becomes the principle of dealing with the world.</p>
<p>Based on this point, people's psychology can be captured by using extreme words such as "extremely", "big", "top", "special", and "very". For example, in movie advertisements, we know that city dwellers are people who long for money and pleasure. Therefore, terms such as "beautiful and young", "flirty and sensual", "soft and warm jade", "queen and emperor", and "especially romantic" are extremely appropriate. If it's already a masterpiece, it can't be considered great. If it's already a great masterpiece, it can't be considered unique. Therefore, "the only great masterpiece" is enough to attract the public. If someone is already a comrade, they must be loyal. If a comrade is loyal, they must be described as "the most loyal." Other female massages have "refreshed spirit", and young girls' singing and dancing have "mysterious nudity, sacrificing beauty." These kinds of sharp publicity texts that can only be written by someone who is considerate and understands people's subtle feelings cannot be copied. In short, in order to serve oneself, one must serve others in every possible way. If the other party wants to kill, we should immediately offer a thousand cuts and ten thousand slashes, offering our livers and brains, and materials for dismemberment with blood and gore. The purpose of these exaggerated advertisements is to use your desire to get a bargain to lure you into losing out. If it doesn't succeed once, try again next time. Like meetings, there are enlarged meetings, plenary meetings, general assemblies, etc., to show the essence of the meeting. As for what will actually happen, we can only wait for the facts to prove it later. At that time, those who lose out will lose out, and those who take advantage will take advantage. Then it will be up to the talented people to come up with other tricks.</p>
<p>In China, the uses of men of letters and talent may be a little more numerous. Otherwise, those who control life and death are not them, but articles always cannot do without them. Not to mention ordinary publicity and advertisements, and even novels, romances, etc. ... they are needed. Even if a certain military commander wants to make a statement for himself, or a certain rich man wants to write a birthday essay for his mother, they are indispensable. Because of such a wide range of uses, the number of talented people exceeds the demand, but birthday essays and declarations are limited. This is indeed a difficult thing to deal with. The recent Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee felt the problem of talent and decided on a plan to limit liberal arts in universities and increase science, which seems to be quite in line with the times.</p>
<p>However, the facts tell us that if there are no needed commodities on the market, factories will not be well-received if they try to produce as much as possible. The contribution of a science scholar who lacks understanding of modern social economics to the current society is not much different from that of a confused talented person. If you don't believe it, please see that there are people who studied medicine who went to become county magistrates, and people who studied geology who went to become tax bureau chiefs. In addition, many famous talented people also came from scientific backgrounds. What can be done? Do whatever is more useful! If one can eat peacefully, who would want to use tricks such as price reductions and big price reductions?</p>
<p>If it is true that more people with scientific minds increase in the future, it would be a good phenomenon. Inevitably, one day, everything will be based on reason and facts, and all phenomena seen through in the laboratory and under the microscope will be very clear. At that time, talented people who write birthday essays and declarations will of course be of little use and will decrease, but I am afraid that "exaggerated publicity" will lose its effect, the word "most" will not be popular, "mystery" will also be broken, and even "price reduction" will be unwanted.</p>
<h3>Smart People and Fools</h3>
<p>— Wu Zeyi</p>
<p>Readers of "The Scholars" will always have a feeling of contempt and indignation when they see the section where Wang Yuhui forces his daughter to starve to death to become a virtuous woman. In fact, things like this: hoping that others can stand up and sacrifice themselves to become benevolent, become national heroes, become martyrs, become virtuous women, become heroes, while they themselves hide behind, taking advantage of the glory and enjoying the blessings, are everywhere, and are indeed genuine national quintessence in our country. Especially in the current years when the country is in distress, the mentality of hoping that others will be martyrs is even more prevalent. Therefore, although the general public also gives a thumbs-up to applaud and rejoice in the feat of Yoon Bong-gil throwing a bomb in Hongkou Park, China ultimately cannot produce even half a Yoon Bong-gil. The reason lies in this point.</p>
<p>If we want to give examples, we can just say it casually: a month ago, a certain Shanghai national salvation organization telegraphed the 19th Route Army to move north and kill bandits outside the pass. News of the arrest of "patriotic men" from the Blood Soul Corps was repeatedly published in the newspapers, with the implication of inspiring those who came later. Even after Su Bingwen's army was defeated and retreated into Russia, a certain important person solemnly telegraphed him, urging him to return to Heilongjiang and continue to work hard with the Japanese. As for the telegrams urging national generals to mobilize and resist Japan, they fly like snowflakes whenever the situation seems serious. Can we dare not say that this is well-intentioned? However, behind the good intentions, there is clearly another mentality actively jumping: hoping that others will stand up and be martyrs, be national heroes, while they themselves enjoy the blessings in the rear.</p>
<p>Understanding this mentality, we can explain why the righteous armies truly fighting in the Northeast are becoming fewer and fewer, while the Shanghai ××× Support Association and the national masses who "swear to be the backing" are becoming more and more numerous and singing more enthusiastically.</p>
<p>However, fools such as martyrs, heroes, and even national heroes will eventually die out. Now many have already died. When one day China is left with only "smart people who swear to be the backing", Japan's continental policy can be completed, and at that time, perhaps it will be the end of China, which is as huge as a bear and as smart as a monkey.</p>
<h3>I Have Found a Lover</h3>
<p>— Li Li</p>
<p>I have found a lover, she really loves me very much, she makes me feel like "I am hers!" Regarding this point, I am not fabricating rumors. Here, there are facts that can be used to prove it.</p>
<p>Once, she said to me: "Friend, I love you. Because of my love for you, I want to hold you in my mouth like a candy, sweetly."</p>
<p>After hearing this, I thought: "This is really terrible. In this way, wouldn't I be worn away by her?"</p>
<p>However, I was timid and did not say it.</p>
<p>Another time, she said to me: "Good person, I love you. Because of my love for you, I want to give you something. But I have been thinking about it and I really can't think of anything that I can give to you. Good, good person, let me give you my heart."</p>
<p>After hearing this, I became terrified and thought: "Ah, even more terrible. How can a person's heart be given to others? Is it possible for a person to dig out their heart?"</p>
<p>However, I was still timid and did not say it.</p>
<p>Yet another time, she said to me: "My good person, I love you. Because of my love for you, I want to sincerely make a request to you: My good person, please give me your heart."</p>
<p>After hearing this, I was so anxious that tears fell down. I thought: "I don't want a lover anymore, I don't dare to have a lover anymore. Having a lover is troublesome and dangerous."</p>
<p>However, I was still timid, just thinking in my heart and feeling sad in my heart, and did not say it.</p>
<h3>What's in a Vacuum Tube?</h3>
<p>— Xia</p>
<p>The term vacuum tube has become very common. Judging by its name, we can know that a vacuum tube is a glass tube with nothing in it. However, vacuum tubes are not really empty. Facts tell us that there are indeed many things in the tube that we cannot imagine.</p>
<p>Suppose there is a round glass sphere with a diameter of five. The air inside it has been pumped out to a considerable extent with a vacuum pump. In other words, it can be said to be a vacuum. However, there are still many things inside this glass sphere:</p>
<p>㈠ Molecules ·· 288,500,000,000,000,000</p>
<p>㈡ Gas molecules ·· 77,600,000,000,000,000</p>
<p>㈢ Molecules ·· 5,450,000,000,000,000</p>
<p>㈣ Carbon dioxide molecules ·· 644,000,000,000</p>
<p>㈤ Molecules ·· 4,470,000,000</p>
<p>㈥ Molecules ·· 25,000,000</p>
<p>㈦ Molecules ·· 5,000,000</p>
<p>Moreover, although there are 369,998,495,000,000,000 molecules moving around in this tube, it does not feel slightly crowded. As for the air pressure inside the sphere, it is only one hundred millionth of the atmospheric pressure. If the air pressure inside the sphere is equal to the atmospheric pressure, then there will be 28,988,423,520,000,000,000 molecules present. So, until now, there is no absolute vacuum tube in this world.</p>

<h3>Crossroads of the Times and Love 35</h3>
<p>— Zhang Ziping</p>
<p>Shunxing continued to ask his mother. At that moment, Shuhua looked at her brother again. Then everyone fell silent for a while.</p>
<p>Hearing footsteps coming up from below. Haiquan looked towards the door and saw an old nanny bringing a five-yuan banknote and three silver dollars to Zhuo Ma. Haiquan saw that among the three silver coins, one was a "Yuan head" and two were "Sun Yat-sen". Zhuo Ma said nothing, first placed a "Sun Yat-sen" on the two fingers of her right hand, and then used her left hand to pick up "Yuan Shikai" and tapped it against "Sun Yat-sen". That silver sound was really pleasant to listen to. She then dropped another "Sun Yat-sen" and tapped it in the same way. Afterwards, she put the banknote and silver coins into her pocket together.</p>
<p>"Old Six's, is it?"</p>
<p>Seeing the old nanny still standing on the side, Zhuo Ma asked her.</p>
<p>"It's from Sixth Miss."</p>
<p>The old nanny looked at Zhuo Ma's expression and hurriedly retreated.</p>
<p>After sitting for a while, Haiquan said goodbye to the three of them, mother and sons. He thought that there would be another opportunity to further approach Zhuo Shuhua tonight.</p>
<p>"How about we all go to see a movie together?"</p>
<p>Zhuo Ma said to Haiquan with a smile.</p>
<p>"Mr. Lin, please accompany us."</p>
<p>Shuhua said with a smile, stretching out both hands to tug at Haiquan's sleeves. Although he was a little reluctant to leave her, he had no interest in accompanying her family to the movie.</p>
<p>(16)</p>
<p>Walking out of Zhuo Shuhua's house, he felt that his mood was as cold and lonely as the atmosphere outside. He sighed for no reason, and a milky vapor rose in the dim air near his mouth.</p>
<p>He walked to the tram tracks on North Sichuan Road and felt a little warmer than when he was sitting in Zhuo Shuhua's house. He had originally wanted to return to the Zeng Mansion earlier. But when he imagined the intimate scene between Mrs. Hezi and the Japanese, he felt an unspeakable sadness in his heart.</p>
<p>"Where should I go? ... Ah! Depression! Depression! The depression of a young man who can't find a way out!"</p>
<p>He stood dazed on the road for a long time, and the more he thought about it, the more sad he felt. He looked at the south end of the road, then looked at the north end, and then looked up at the sky. He saw that this prosperous and lively Shanghai was shrouded in a gray-white curtain - a very thick night mist - except for the colorful neon lights nearby, all the lights were blurred, just radiating countless yellow rays. He took out a handkerchief to wipe his eyes.</p>
<p>"Cho Shuzaku just wants to use me. Ridiculous!"</p>
<p>He came here with great hope. But this hope was finally shattered by the hand of the creator.</p>
<p>"If Mrs. Hezi knew that I was standing on this road alone, so lonely and so sad, would she come to pick me up and comfort me?"</p>
<p>As soon as he had this thought, he quickly suppressed it. He knew that his nerves were too tired, so he would have all kinds of boring fantasies.</p>
<p>He took out his watch from his pocket and looked at it. It was five minutes to nine o'clock. He thought it was still so early, and it was too boring to go back and see those happy faces of Japanese guys. So he thought, taking a car is too fast. He decided to walk, walk to the intersection of Edward Road, and then take a bus.</p>
<p>It's best to go back after twelve o'clock, after they're asleep. I have a spring-loaded key, so I don't have to call. ... Decided to ignore her! Even if she comes out to greet me, don't bother with her!</p>

<p>Talking Point</p>
<h3>Talking about Freedom</h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>Waking up in the morning, I opened the newspaper and couldn't help but jump for joy. It turned out that the government was determined to protect the freedom of us ordinary people. So I danced and shouted, calling out to the whole family, and even told my youngest son, who was not yet ten months old, with all my might: "Come on, you should be happy, now we have freedom. Not only is 'going to church' or 'not eating pork' no longer a problem, but even assembling, forming associations, speaking, publishing, living, and even eating and shitting are all one hundred and twenty percent free and easy. Do whatever you want. No one will bother us." "Really?" The old man seemed a little disbelieving. Based on his experience, perhaps I was going crazy again, so I became anxious and red-faced, and said, "Who's lying to you? There's newspaper evidence now."</p>
<p>So I handed the newspaper to them, but the child didn't understand anything and tore the newspaper casually. Looking at it, it seemed like there was a bit of anger.</p>
<p>However, I was still happy after all. I felt that this was a rare opportunity, and I had to enjoy freedom. But thinking about it, weren't we ordinary people very free before? No one forbade us from eating three large pancakes in one meal, no one forbade us from not wearing fur coats in cold weather, no one forbade us from scolding people "your mother", and no one forbade us from buying and selling enemy goods. No one forbade us from dancing to save the country. Then haven't we already been blessed with freedom? After thinking carefully, now we are adding protection to freedom. Protection means protecting freedom within a certain range. Of course, there's no need for ordinary people to ask how big this range can be. Perhaps it can be as small as a birdcage. The little bird "freely" calls and jumps in the cage, compared to singing in the clouds and soaring in the sky, of course, there is an unspeakable sigh of comparing the present with the past. Now, for the sake of protection, a layer of iron walls is firmly added. Then this pitiful calling and jumping is no longer known to outsiders within this heavy protection. Therefore, this protection is very meaningful. As for saying to restore freedom, that is equivalent to opening the cage and releasing the bird. Who can guarantee that this is not worse than letting a tiger return to the mountain?</p>
<p>However, again, from now on, we ordinary people will have another strict guarantee. In the future, we can rightfully say what we want to say, do what we should do, and even freely live in the concession and freely play mahjong. Although this still needs to be added with a sentence: "To know what will happen next, listen to the next installment."</p>
<p>Finally, I want to tell the readers that I have been freely rambling in the protection of freedom. Don't forget that your freedom is now in the safe!</p>

<h3>Sugar</h3>
<p>— Sheng Zhanneng</p>
<p>Sugar is one of the essential food sources for humans and should not be regarded merely as a luxury. The primary function of this carbohydrate is to provide the human body with warmth and is the source of muscular energy.</p>
<p>㈠ Properties of Sugar</p>
<p>The molecular formula of sugar is C12H22O11. It is a monoclinic crystal, colorless and transparent. However, crude sugar contains impurities, giving it a reddish-brown color. When heated to 200 to 210 degrees Celsius, it dehydrates and forms a brown, lumpy substance called caramel. This substance is often used for coloring soy sauce, wine, vinegar, and gravy.</p>
<p>Sucrose chars when exposed to hot, concentrated sulfuric acid. If a concentrated aqueous solution of sucrose is mixed with an equal volume of concentrated sulfuric acid, the mixture turns black and generates carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and water vapor.</p>
<p>When a trace amount of inorganic acid is added to a sucrose solution, and it is heated or left to stand, hydrolysis occurs, producing equal amounts of glucose and fructose. The reaction formula is as follows: C12H22O11 + H2O → C6H12O6 + C6H12O6</p>
<p>Sucrose　　　Glucose　　　Fructose</p>
<p>The mixture of fructose and glucose obtained is called invert sugar. Commercially available invert sugar is a slightly brown lump, widely used in the production of candies and alcohol.</p>
<p>If a sucrose solution is brought into contact with brewer's yeast and left for a long time, the sucrose is transformed into glucose and fructose by the action of the invertase in the yeast, eventually undergoing alcoholic fermentation to produce alcohol.</p>
<p>When sucrose is boiled with acetic anhydride and sodium acetate, it produces octaacetyl sucrose (C12H14O3(o·co·ch3)8), which proves that its molecular formula contains eight hydroxyl groups. This fact, along with its behavior during hydrolysis, suggests that sucrose is formed by the combination of one molecule of glucose and one molecule of fructose. However, the structural formula of sucrose has not yet been definitively determined.</p>
<p>㈡ Origin of Sweetness</p>
<p>The sweetness of sugar is due to the presence of eight hydroxyl groups in its molecular formula. Generally, alcohols and their derivatives (including sugars) in organic compounds often increase their sweetness due to the number of hydroxyl groups they contain. The perception of sweetness is generally closely related to temperature. According to Weber's theory, the highest temperature at which humans perceive sweetness is 50 to 52.5 degrees Celsius; beyond this, it is difficult to discern. Therefore, the perceived concentration of sweetness in a sugar solution varies with temperature. For example, a 0.1% solution can be tasted at room temperature, but at zero degrees, a 0.4% solution is required for recognition. Also, the sensation of sweetness is generally faster than that of bitterness, and its residual effect is weaker. For example, if one takes a bitter medicine containing sugar, the sweetness is felt first, followed by the bitterness. Later, the sweetness disappears, but the bitterness remains, which is clear evidence of this.</p>
<p>㈢ Physiological Functions</p>
<p>The simplest compounds that provide nutrition are called nutrients. Nutrients are divided into four main categories: proteins, fats, carbohydrates, and inorganic salts. Among these, the primary function of carbohydrates is to provide body heat and is the source of muscular energy for humans. Examples include starch, glycogen, sucrose, maltose, and glucose. Therefore, sucrose is one of the essential food sources for humans and should not be regarded merely as a luxury.</p>
<p>Sucrose taken into the human body is broken down into glucose, fructose, etc., by the action of invertase, passes through the intestinal wall, enters the portal venous blood through capillaries, and then flows into the muscle tissue through arterial blood (at this point, the sugar has been completely converted to glucose) to be oxidized and decomposed. The resulting carbon dioxide flows out through the veins. The heat generated during the decomposition process is used to maintain body temperature and provide chemical energy to the muscles. This is the source of our physical strength. Furthermore, excessive sugar intake often turns into butyric acid due to fermentation, or flows into the bloodstream without any change and is excreted by the kidneys.</p>
<h3>Nonsense</h3>
<p>— Lifu</p>
<p>If the Chinese people can use the gifts intended for the Winter Solstice to support the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army, then at least several thousand dwarf slaves can be killed.</p>
<p>If the political dignitaries would unite and direct the military expenditure of the perennial civil wars towards foreign aggression, then the three eastern provinces would not be陷於 Japan.</p>
<p>If the wealthy would invest the money poured into opium dens into donation boxes, then the money would not leak abroad, the finances would be enriched, and the people would be strengthened.</p>
<p>Now that modern women have seen through that they are treated as playthings by men and are striving for liberation, why do they dress so flamboyantly and show off their charms in public?</p>
<p>Clerk Correspondence</p>
<h3>A Study on How Clerks Can Resist Japan</h3>
<p>Since Mr. Zhou Liangji raised the question last year, "Standing in the position of shop assistants, workers, and apprentices, how can we fulfill our duty as a member of the Republic of China and carry out the work of resisting Japan and saving the country?", we have considered this question to be of great importance and needing to be decided based on various objective conditions, so we publicly solicited readers' opinions. In addition to the few articles published last year, there are still many letters offering excellent methods. Now we have compiled them into a conclusion that does not sing high-sounding tunes, but relies on what each individual can do within their capacity, and requires each individual to earnestly carry out:</p>
<p>First, economic sanctions must be strictly implemented. In many readers' letters, this method is mentioned almost universally, and we also acknowledge and believe that it is the most effective. Past events have told us that "economic sanctions" is only a slogan. Although it has become a reality, it is only as fleeting as a night-blooming cereus, pitifully short! After suffering the severe blow of the "January 28th Incident," tens of millions of enemy goods were still imported. The lack of organization and perseverance of the Chinese people is evident here! Standing in the position of shop assistants, etc., we will not make unrealistic arguments, but only require each individual to earnestly adhere to the principle of purchasing domestic goods for everything, whether it is clothing, food, or daily necessities. For items that domestic goods lack and must be used, Western goods should be used only as a minimum. This should be promoted from oneself to one's family, and then to one's relatives and friends. If one person does this, and the whole country does this, even without any organization, the goal of "economic sanctions" can be achieved. We are not saying that organization is unnecessary, but rather that the Chinese people lack organization! If we can identify the goal and move forward in unison, we will have effectively created a great invisible organization.</p>
<p>However, there are many unscrupulous merchants who use the promotion of domestic goods as a facade, using enemy goods to deceive customers in order to achieve their personal wealth. Such people are certainly despicable, but going to such places can demonstrate the shop assistants' loyalty and patriotism. As for how to implement this, please see Mr. Zheng Jinmen's letter:</p>
<p>"...Customers buy goods, originally not necessarily"</p>
<p>Those with enemy goods, because of low prices or beautiful colors, only need to be pleasing, and they buy them. They don't bother to ask if they are Eastern or Western goods. Even worse, a small number of hateful clerks, knowing they are Eastern goods, refuse to say they are Western goods or directly say they are domestic goods. This causes patriotic compatriots to be greatly deceived in secret, buying and buying their enemy goods in particular! Such clerks have no patriotic ideas, only know how to flatter the boss and deceive customers, which is most hateful!"</p>
<p>"The method I propose is that when customers come to buy goods, you should first give them the choice of domestic or Western goods. Sometimes customers have already selected Japanese goods in the display window, you can gently say to them: 'These are Japanese goods, please don't buy them.' I think if customers have any humanity, they will certainly blush and release them to buy other goods.</p>
<p>"However, this matter must be done secretly. If it is heard by a colleague who is not on good terms with you, and they tell the boss, then your job will definitely be broken; so it is best to contact the colleagues in the store and work together. Even if there is a little leak, the boss will also secretly suffer, and will never dismiss all the staff together...."</p>
<p>Although Mr. Zheng's words are a bit impassioned, they are also true. Customers cannot be deceived when purchasing goods. Mr. Zheng's method, within the possible range, can also be adopted.</p>
<p>Second, prepare for armed resistance; there are two types of resistance to violent Japan, active and passive. Passive resistance is the "economic sanctions" mentioned above, and active resistance is to strengthen national defense and prepare for armed resistance. Although armed resistance is not possible for shop assistants, we cannot but have this preparation to urge our government. As Mr. Ying Zhongyuan's letter says! "…Those with money should contribute money to buy bullets, guns, airplanes, anti-aircraft equipment, etc., and those with strength should contribute strength to receive military training to prepare for a strong rear defense. At the same time, I also hope that the military officers of the whole country will forever end internal strife and jointly resist foreign insults, so that all guns are pointed outward, becoming a strong national defense army. …"</p>
<p>Although Mr. Ying's proposal cannot be realized immediately, shop assistants cannot receive military training due to their duties and other relationships, but this kind of thinking cannot be absent. In the future, we can slowly think of ways to break through the environment and achieve the realm of practice.</p>
<p>Third, increase personal knowledge, as Mr. Yao Kuangsheng's letter says: "To save the country, first save the locality, to save the locality, first save the family, to save the family, first save oneself. Can one's own knowledge and ability take on this responsibility of saving the country? Otherwise, one must remedy one's own knowledge and ability.…"</p>
<p>Indeed, saving the country requires profound knowledge and great ability. Our shop assistants cannot receive higher education due to environmental constraints! That is undeniable, because in order to take on the important task of saving the country, we must prepare to increase our knowledge at any time and under any difficulty.</p>
<p>The sound of cannons has sounded, Shanhaiguan has fallen into enemy hands, and Japanese imperialism, with its ferocious face and murderous weapons, has come to massacre our compatriots. Military officers have also sent telegrams one after another, willing to be vanguards and fight against the violent Japanese. At this moment of national crisis, how should we, the people in the rear, be firm and unyielding, and carry out the work of resisting Japan and saving the country in terms of spirit and material?</p>

<h3>Sympathizer (Continued 12)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Meng Guobao was naturally unhappy with his appearance, and thought that Wang Laoer was so respectful to the old master, and he had offended the old master for him, which was not very good, so he smiled and said: If I had money, I would definitely do the lending business, not buy land. The old master's face finally smiled when he heard this, and said: People like you, sir, who live in the city, can deposit money in banks, why bother lending? The two of them were talking here, but Wang Laoer was not convenient to interrupt, but just asked the person sitting on the carrying pole about the disasters in other villages. Are there disasters in Xixiang? Will it work out this spring? Seeing that the shredded tobacco on the 看上了 was finished, he grabbed another handful from inside, and used a tile pot to re-brew a pot of tea. Then he invited Meng Guobao to accompany the old master, and went out to invite a few neighbors from the village. Seeing that there were more people, Meng Guobao sneaked out of the hall and went to the vegetable garden in the back to get some fresh air. He stood under the loofah trellis and saw through the window of the yellow mud wall, it was the kitchen of someone else's house. Wang Ersao was constantly turning around on the stove, her face was red, and beads of sweat were streaming down her face. Looking at the steam on the stove, which formed a white mist, it was still rising upwards, so you can know how busy people are, and said with a smile: Today, Ersaozi is really busy. She suddenly heard someone talking outside the window, and when she saw it was Mr. Meng, she smiled and said: The old master is here, so it is always right to be busy. When she spoke, her eyeballs turned in her long eyelashes, and she lowered her head again. Seeing that she was a little embarrassed, Meng Guobao didn't bother to linger here, turned around, and was about to leave. But Wang Ersao rushed over, stood at the window, smiled at him, and whispered: Mr. Meng. When Meng Guobao came over, she stretched out her hand and grabbed a large handful of loofah seeds from her pocket, placed them on the window sill, and smiled, there are many people outside, and the seeds must be finished. After she said that, she lowered her head and went under the stove to start a fire. Meng Guobao stood under the melon shed and slowly嗑瓜子.</p>

<h3>Gary Cooper's Beastly Decorations</h3>
<p>— Wentao</p>
<p>Overseas News</p>
<p>This may be a truly heard message. Recently, Gary Cooper built a magnificent residence in Beverly Hills. The interior decoration is very peculiar and spectacular. He almost entirely used African animals to decorate everything in the house. He did not hesitate to spend huge sums of money for the renovation of this house, and personally endured hardships, traversing thousands of mountains and dwelling among beasts in Africa, to hunt many exotic birds and rare animals, which he collected in his residence in Beverly Hills. After several thorough sorting and research, he hired several sculptors to carve these many animal bones into various utensils, which were distributed and decorated in the room. The total number of animals he has acquired this time is indeed comparable to the animals in any beast film. He almost moved the entire African animal kingdom to his residence.</p>
<p>Although Hollywood's decorations can be said to be all-encompassing, this kind of decoration is still seen for the first time in Hollywood.</p>
<p>Two ferocious lions are displayed on both sides of the entrance to his residence. The floor of the living room is covered with a large carpet made of various animal skins. The chairs in the room are all covered with zebra skin felt. A tiger skin felt is spread on the central round table. Several pairs of unusual deer heads are hung on the walls, as well as many photo frames made of lion bones. The cigarette dish on the table is entirely made of wild boar hooves. Isn't this so peculiar and sophisticated? The handles on the car doors are made of wild boar bones. The seats in the carriage are covered with giraffe skin. The floor of his bedroom is also covered with a piece of fire beast skin felt. A felt made of fifty antelope skins is laid on the bed. Many rhino, antelope, leopard, and giraffe necks are hung on the walls of the room. The bookends on the desk are made of lion bones. In short, all the decorations in his room are entirely decorated with exotic African animals. If you say you want to visit the exotic birds and rare animals of Africa, then his residence is an excellent zoo.</p>
<p>Movie Review</p>
<h3>Nanjing Liangxiao Flower Unraveling Words (Good Night Vienna)</h3>
<p>— God</p>
<p>Probably because the Nanjing Theater believes that British films have weak appeal, it deliberately uses the name of the United Artists film company, the American distributor of the film, as a guise. But this film produced by British National Films is above the waterline.</p>
<p>British films inevitably show their inherent national character 丨 severe slowness, but this one is light and witty, showing itself against the background of Vienna. The plot tells the story of an Austrian officer who falls in love with a flower-selling Vicki, but his father, the general, forces him to marry a female duke. On the night of the engagement, he rejected the marriage contract, but the war broke out suddenly. Because he had to go to the front line immediately, he did not have time to say goodbye to her, which caused her misunderstanding, thinking that he had been forced by his father to be engaged to the female duke. After the war, the officer lost his job and opened a shoe store, while Vicki became famous on the stage. The result is inevitably "lovers become family members."</p>
<p>Director Herbert Wilcox has some delicate skills. For example, when Vicki doesn't recognize her lover in the shoe store, she is both in love and annoyed, so that she covers her face with the newspaper, which can fully express a state of psychological contradiction. The dialogue is very clever and humorous; the music and songs are also very helpful in supporting the plot, only "connoisseurs" can fully appreciate it?</p>
<p>Having been baptized by the American film industry, Jack Buchanan has many witty actions and lively costumes, showing his "British Chevalier" personality, indeed he is earning credit for the whole film. The heroine is Anna Neagle.</p>
<h3>Guangluo Red Dust Drifting (Strange Interlude)</h3>
<p>— Brilliant</p>
<p>Too few MGM films are shown at Guangluo. This Strange Interlude is not only produced by MGM, but also one of the world's structures. This film opened up a new situation for sound films and created an unprecedented record. Because it has become the pioneer of stage plays. In addition to the extremely large amount of dialogue, each character's thoughts 丨 self-doubt 丨 are explained in words, combined with appropriate performance, it really thoroughly makes the audience understand everything. Originally, "language is the voice of the heart," but now "the voice of the heart" is actually expressed in words. Starting with this film, I am afraid that many films will take this new path in the future. Of course, it is a great disadvantage for people who cannot understand English. The plot tells the story of more than 20 years, advancing step by step. The brilliance is entirely in the profound and moving performance. Norma Shearer, from a girl to a young woman, to a middle-aged woman, and to an old woman, has an appropriate performance identity at any time. This is her greatest success. Clark Cable is also not an easy character to play. There have also been some changes in the style, and Robert Young is the best of the supporting roles.</p>
<h3>Cathay Union Station (Union Depot)</h3>
<p>— Ailian</p>
<p>Xiao Fanpengke was not very successful last year, but this year's "Love in the Battlefield" has created a brilliant future for him. In the recent "Union Station" of the First National, he plays a small pickpocket. In terms of performance, he is indeed a promising talent, especially in the workmanship of the love scenes. At the same time, the film pays close attention to the wandering life of the poor, which is very appropriate and described fairly faithfully. The life of the lower class under the current economic society can deeply impress people. The director is very good, he has the experience and thinking of "going to the people." The photography and lighting are commendable. The whole film is compact, the editing is effective, the scene changes are clear, and the supporting roles are very neat. The plot is ordinary, but it has a good artistic success, and it is always worth watching.</p>
<h3>Carlton Sweet Love (Hot Heiress)</h3>
<p>— Yannan</p>
<p>Sweet Love is a comedy that depicts classless love, and at the same time, it has a "conscious" expression of the fetters of the wealthy and the sacredness of the proletariat. Things that cannot be satisfactory in reason are forced to be satisfactory, which is inevitably ridiculed as acting. The interweaving is good, the dialogue is not very much, and there are often small humorous tones or performances. Apart from the humorous and delightful ones, the supporting roles are all very ordinary. Ben Lyon and other actors are very hardworking. However, due to the limitations of the script, it seems that they cannot fully display their strengths. The scenery can be considered grand. The position of the lens and the lighting are worth seeing. In short, if you like love movies, then this is a good movie, which can very well suit the taste of young lovers.</p>
<h3>Guanghua Loyalty and Flesh and Blood</h3>
<p>— Linghe</p>
<p>Rushing to Guanghua, buying a ticket and entering the door, oh! It's very lively, there are people everywhere, probably more than a hundred. So I waited very comfortably for the opening, there were empty seats on both sides, just enough to put clothes and hats, and I could even put my feet up and sleep for a while.</p>
<p>After a strange noise, my emotions became tense, and sure enough, Love and Flesh and Blood opened. Scenes of moving people flowed by non-stop, I was confused and didn't know where I was going, probably I had reached the eighteenth level of hell. Afterwards, I was awakened by a burst of applause, and I turned around, and it turned out that I was having a nightmare. I thought: This movie must be too good, otherwise why would there be so many children applauding?</p>
<p>"It's very stuffy here, let's go back," I made up my mind and left my seat, only to hear someone saying in my ear:</p>
<p>"Wait" a while, there is also "amazing" "belly pain from laughing."</p>
<p>However, in this "time of national crisis," I had no interest in laughing.</p>
<p>When I was swaggering and about to walk out of the theater, I heard a worker-like person saying to another:</p>
<p>"This is love and bones.······"</p>
<p>Walking home, looking at the description, it turned out to be such a story!</p>
<h3>Go to Broadway to Blow Bubbles</h3>

<p>New Movie Introduction</p>
<h3>Karma Sea Double Mandarin Ducks</h3>
<p>— Qing</p>
<p>The great masterpiece of Tianyi Company in 1932, "Karma Sea Double Mandarin Ducks," will be released in this city soon. "Karma Sea Double Mandarin Ducks" is a very profound description and clear indication of the toxicity of inheritance.</p>
<p>We know how terrible the sin of money is in a society under the private property system! Look at those rich people who own thousands and thousands of properties. They will soon be holding the power of money to oppress and dazzle most of the poor in the Nanjing Theater's opening film "Remaining Life." Warner Baxter in Six Hours to Live co-starring with John Bowers and Marilyn Gordon. This film is one of the excellent works of Fox Company. They rarely generously take out money to do public welfare. Their biggest wish and purpose is to bequeath all private property to their children, so that after they die, before the body is cold, a huge strange drama has occurred in the family, brothers and sisters, for the unequal distribution of inheritance, wallowing in the wall, and suing in court, this ugly state, we can often see in the newspaper. Tianyi Company's "Karma Sea Double Mandarin Ducks" is aimed at this point to describe.</p>
<p>The scenery of this film is by Mr. Tang Xiaodan, who is a young artist with a lot of cultivation in fine arts. The family of a rich man in one scene of the film is decorated very Tang Huang beautifully, it is said that it took more than ten days of effort and thousands of dollars. There are also gardens and moons, which are also decorated very carefully and exquisitely, opening a new record that Tianyi Company has never had before.</p>
<p>In addition, what we should also pay attention to is the heroine Shao Suxia, who is the daughter of Mr. Shao Cunren, the associate of Tianyi Company. Although she is very young, she performed quite well. In the past silent films, we have seen her lively performance like a little bird. This film is her debut in a sound film.</p>
<h3>Overseas Stars Celebrate New Year's Day</h3>
<p>— Ms. Ouyang Jinping</p>
<p>In Hollywood, the place, from Christmas to New Year's Day, the stars are all happily and wildly celebrating all night. I happened to get last year's New York Daily News New Year's edition, in which the records are miscellaneous, and can also be used as a New Year's embellishment.</p>
<p>The hot girl Clara Bow, in the early morning of New Year's Day, put on light makeup and then went around Hollywood. After the tour, she ate with the female companions she knew, drank a little and got drunk, and the fun was endless.</p>
<p>Universal Pictures dance star Mae Clarke, starting from New Year's Eve, danced in the dance hall until New Year's Day evening, without showing any fatigue: and she was even more energetic than usual. She said: Of all the days of the year, New Year's Day is the happiest.</p>
<p>Garbo has a favorite dog, Mannqiu, who on New Year's Day, ran to the homes of the male and female stars he knew, shook hands to congratulate, jumped and screamed back and forth; and also helped people groom and dress, which was very clever and likable.</p>
<p>Van Bonk likes to play boxing matches in the New Year. The loser of his companions invites guests every time. Van is a macro eater, in addition to enjoying the feast, he also likes to perform the must-win technique of boxing during the banquet, which moves all his companions.</p>
<p>Paramount actress Carmen Ponce uses New Year's cards with sparkling gemstones inlaid on them, which are given to her dear stars and are most popular with people.</p>
<h3>The Talents of the Match King (3)</h3>
<p>— Xi Mengpi</p>
<p>Paul calmly took out a ring from his pocket and slipped it on to Betty's finger. His magnetic eyes gazed deeply into Betty's eyes, and he said in a low and solemn voice, "This ring is a keepsake from my mother. I want you to wear it, until..." He pushed her away, as if his love had burned to an unbearable degree. After a pause, he added, "Let's hurry. There's only an hour until the train leaves. I'll wait for you at the Gare du Nord station. Come when you're ready, and we'll meet in front of the information desk. Soon we will embark on a journey to California. Hurry, my dear." He waved his hand, hailed a taxi, and helped her into the car. She, her eyes fixed on the ring, her eye sockets filled with happy tears, got into the car without a word. Paul waited until the car was far away, then hailed another taxi.</p>
<p>"To Central Station," he instructed the driver haughtily. "I have fourteen minutes left. Can I catch the train to New York?"</p>
<p>"Get in, sir," the driver said. "I guarantee you'll make it."</p>
<p>Paul got into the car without hesitation. The pain Betty would suffer upon discovering she had been deceived, the old foreman's discovery of the theft of his savings, and the danger to Betty's life, were all not on his mind. When he arrived in New York, he only had time to prepare new clothes. He had many sets of fancy clothes made, bought a quantity of high-end luggage, and then took a boat to Sweden.</p>
<p>The Holmstead Match Company's office was located in a very small and simply furnished room. The company's directors, except for Eric, were all middle-aged petite bourgeois, who welcomed Paul Krull's return to his hometown with the sincerity of old country folk. They were all attracted by Paul's personality and conquered by his eloquence, and agreed with Paul's proposal to merge with other match companies in order to achieve flexibility in capital turnover and stable interest rates. But Eric maintained a cautious attitude and did not believe as fervently as others. In addition, there was a banker named Layson, a short and shrewd man, who was deeply suspicious of Paul's plan, because according to Paul's plan, after the company merged, the bank would also have to advance 10,000 krona (Swedish currency) with all of Paul's businesses in the United States as collateral. Later, Eric and Layson were ultimately defeated by the majority of the board, and the merger plan was passed. Layson secretly planned to investigate just how big of a business this amazing Mr. Paul Krull actually had in America. So when the board meeting adjourned, Layson followed closely behind Paul.</p>
<p>"Paul," Layson asked sincerely but with suspicion, "You clearly know that your signature today isn't even worth the ink it's written with! You have nothing in America; you're a pauper everywhere you go! A year ago, when I went to America, you saw me and begged me to return to my hometown, without mentioning a word about your life in America. Now you've come back and are using deceptive means to arbitrarily dispose of our company. This is extremely dangerous for our company's future. This is also my duty, and I must..."</p>
